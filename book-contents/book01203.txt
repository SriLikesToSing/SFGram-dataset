GALAXY and the GALAXY 



In the past four years or so some- 
thing on the order of twenty 
thousand manuscripts have passed 
through my hands. After the first 
few thousand I became suspicious. 
After ten thousand the suspicion 
thickened. Now, after twenty 
thousand manuscripts I am certain: 
science fiction, as a growing, con- 
ceptually vital field, is in a state of 
crisis, a crisis of ideas, a crisis that 
it may not survive. 

Oh, as a minor, formula-oriented 
literary subgenre — or sub-literary 
genre — it is secure enough. More 
people than ever seem to be reading 
it; the moguls of television and Hol- 
lywood are beginning to take a seri- 
ous interest. But where are the new 
ideas? In television? The movies? 
The formula in those honorable 
media seems to be to take some an- 
tique theme from the 40 ’s or 
50’ s — adventures aboard the crip- 
pled, multi-generation colony ship 
that will forever wander aimlessly 
between the stars, or aboard the 
FTL vessel that has slipped into a 
"space warp” and is Lost In 
Space — and adapt it. Adaptation 
meaning in this case to bastardize, 
prostitute, mindlessly oversimplify, 
and otherwise make suitable for the 



moguls’ conception of the mass- 
mentality what was initially in hon- 
est if somewhat be whiskered sci- 
ence fictional conception. Even the 
many new readers (long may they 
prosper!) are mostly interested in 
what science fiction has been, not 
what it is becoming. 

And who can blame them? What 
little there is in the way of original- 
ity in modern science fiction con- 
sists in the main of variations on the 
theme of human misery. Misery 
without end — an all-embracing, 
open-ended misery that is almost 
admirable in its single-minded af- 
firmation that the game of life is 
fixed: that you’ve got to play; that 
you can’t win; and that in every 
possible aspect of its potentially in- 
finite variation, now and forever, 
the playing itself must be a misera- 
ble experience, filled with pain, de- 
void of joy. An affirmation, in 
other words, that it is better to be 
dead tban to be alive. 

Is it any wonder, then, that the 
latest re-issue of The City and the 
Stars is selling like hotcakes? Or 
that the Foundation Trilogy is in its 
umpteenth printing? Hardly. People 
— even intelligent people — can be 
told only so many times that life by 



EDITORIAL 



definition is a bucket of sewage 
with the handle inside, firmly af- 
fixed to the bottom of the bucket, 
before they wander off to look for 
the latest Asimov or Heinlein re- 
issue, even if it is Lucky Star and 
the Pirates of the Asteroids, or 
Have Spacesuit — Will Travel. I’ve 
done it myself. 

Are there then no glorious new 
conceptions equivalent for the 70’ $ 
and 80’ s of what space travel and 
extraterrestrial intelligence were for 
an earlier time? Have we indeed mn 
out of ideas? Is there nothing left 
but infinite variations on a strictly 
limited number of antique themes, 
the mental poverty being at best 
obscured under the guise of literary 
experimentation? 

For a while I thought that that 
might indeed be the case, but I have 
since concluded that far from there 
being too few ideas, there are too 
many, and that taken together, as 
they must be, they offer, insist 
upon, a “universe of discourse” so 
varied and vast in scope that it de- 
fies the imagination and perhaps 
even (dare I say it?) the intelligence 
of the best of us, even unto our sci- 
ence fiction writers, brilliant as they 
all undoubtedly are. 

Indeed, it may well be the case 
that the reason, the real reason, for 
the nearly universal nihilism in 
modem sf — sf that is not merely a 
rehashing of old themes — is that the 
ramifications of assuming continued 
progress in science and technology 
are simply too difficult to conceive, 



that such future vistas are simply 
too vast to be grasped. 

So where are all these ideas that I 
claim are being willfully ignored? 
The same place they always were: 
in the writings of scientists and their 
popularizers. Virtually every area of 
science is pregnant with major, 
high-social-impact developments, de- 
velopments that are not, many of 
them, “looming on the horizon,” 
but are literally waiting for funding. 

Space: Microwave -powered stel- 
lar probes; O’Neill colonies; as- 
teroid mining; orbital power- 
generating stations; planetary en- 
gineering (Venus, in particular, is 
ripe for the plucking). 

Biology: Recombinant DNA re- 
search (maybe that should wait on 
the availability of orbital lab- 
oratories); “btu bushes,” plants 
capable of harvesting ten or twenty 
percent of the sunlight that falls on 
them; a cloned work force of semi- 
intelligent simians that are bred for 
happiness, docility — and manual 
labor; biological sewage systems 
capable of reharvesting, with the aid 
of sunlight, everything that is 
dumped into them. 

Cybernetics: Artificial Intel- 

ligence (called “A. I." by those 
in the field); “hand calculators” 
that by virtue of being mobile ex- 
tensions of giant computers (see 
“Artificial Intelligence") have avail- 
able to them the sum total of 
human knowledge and computa- 
tional capacity, devices that would 
make all but the dullest of us 



GALAXY 



hyper-intelligent and almost omnis- 
cient. 

The list is endless; the available 
grist for the science fictional mill is 
virtually infinite, both in variety and 
quantity. 

But there is a kicker: it’s all or 
nothing. The writer cannot just go 
to the idea shelf, posit one that he 
likes, and proceed to examine its 
implications in isolation from all the 
rest. If any of them happen, they all 
happen, or at least a very large 
number of them do. There will be 
no O’Neill colonies without plenti- 
ful power, without asteroid mining 
giving us a super abundance of 
minerals, without amplified human 
intelligence, without, without every- 
thing. 

That’s pan of the problem. It gets 
worse: each one of these develop- 
ments is but the tip of a conceptual 
iceberg of further developments and 
applications. 

Take the laser, for one example. 
At first it was an interesting gadget 
useful for measuring distant objects 
and cutting close ones in a spectacu- 
lar manner, with maybe distant ap- 
plications as a communications de- 
vice. Now it is, or soon will be, a 
space propulsion system, a surgical 
tool, the heart of an anti -ballistic - 
missile system, a “science fiction 
death-ray,” and who knows what 
else. 

The same is true for all the de- 
velopments now pending. Let's take 
just one of them and follow its 
ramifications as far as imagination

fortified by a few calculations will 
take us. 

The O'Neill colonies: assume that 
they are feasible. Assuming that, 
you have also assumed that they are 
pretty much, in the long run at 
least, resource-independent of earth 
— that they can grow their own 
food from raw materials of extra- 
terrestrial origin, and that they have 
manufacturing capacity such (hat 
they are capable of self-replication 
(which latter capacity (hey will pos- 
sess almost by definition; the first 
colonies will, after all, have virtu- 
ally built themselves). 

What, then, would be the “limits 
of growth” for such colonies? Other 
than human procreativity the only 
limiting factor 1 can come up with 



EDITORIAL 



is mass (which would come into 
play long before available sun- 
power — the famous “Dyson Lim- 
it” — would become a factor). 
In other words, conservatively 
speaking, the potential “mass” of 
humanity would seem to be limited 
only by the present mass of the 
solar system's asteroids, moons and 
smaller planets — and I suspect that 
when they are needed the means 
will be available for plucking the 
gas giants as well. 

Note, please, that we are not talk- 
ing here of some unimaginably dis- 
tant, million-years-hence future; in 
terms of the already etapsed lifetime 
of our species the urbanization of 
the solar system is but an eyeblink 
away. Even in the short term the fi- 
gures are startling. 

Starting with a core population of 
fifty thousand colonists in the Year 
2000, by 2250 there will be more 
people in space than presently re- 
side on this planet. By the Year 
2600 there will be a trillion, far 
more than earth could possibly 
hold. Before the fourth millennium 
has run its course, a quadrillion — 
and population pressure will begin 
to be such that the more adventur- 
ous will have headed for the stars, 
in perfect indifference as to whether 
such stars have "earth- like” 

planets, so long as there is mass 
available. The Great Exodus will 
have begun 

Assuming a propulsion system 
capable of attaining a velocity one- 
tenth that of light (.1 c, or 30,000 
km./sec.), in a few million years it 



will be over. The galaxy will be- 
long to humanity. .or will it be 
over? Perhaps the yawning gulfs be- 
tween the galaxies will not seem so 
unbridgeable by then. 

Ok. That’s as far as I can go with 
space colonies. Now add in- 
telligence amplification (is it a per- 
son or a machine — only the compo- 
site entity knows for sure). Artifi- 
cial intelligence. Inevitable contact 
with non-human intelligences (if we 
can’t find them, we’ll breed them). 
A thousand other things. Now mix 
them all together — and don’t forget 
that they will all interact on each 
other and on us in infinitely com- 
plex fashion, and at an ever- 
accelcrating pace. 

Now add at least one fundamental 
development on a par with lasers 
and space colonies that has not yet 
been conceived; any story pretend- 
ing to deal with the future that does 
not have at least one such is mere 
fantasy. 

Now write me a story that takes 
all of this at least implicitly into ac- 
count. 

Clearly our future, if we have 
• one at all, is so complex as to seem 
beyond mortal comprehension: what 
then of fictional portrayal of that fu- 
ture? Who among us can take this 
kaleidoscope of ever shifting, un- 
ending, always interacting and evolv- 
ing marvels and fix it in his mental 
grasp? Can anyone? As a science- 
fiction editor I can only hope that 
one of you out there will prove to 
me that it can be done.

Frank Herbert Frederik Pohl J.E. Pournelle 



ARSEN DARNAY SPIDER ROBINSON CHARLES SHEFFIELD 



The tank spun slowly in far 
cold space at the inner reaches of 
the asteroid mines. A sparkling frost 
clung to it; water condensed and 
frozen on its aluminum skin, water 
condensed alter the blast and wreck- 
age of a mining platform . They 
were all a mass of tanks, those 
ships, great tanks and clusters of 
pipes, miles of pipes curving back 
on each other, and miles of wires, 
all propelled by supersteam gener- 
ated from uranium fires. The steam 
engine was a remarkable device. 
Who would have thought that the 
same principle that powered Watt 
and Fulton would, three hundred 
years later, power a mining plat- 
form half a mile long, hung up in 
space to sweep asteroids? The old 
fiction writers were the only ones 
who dared. No sane scientist would 
have ventured it. They knew some- 
thing, those old dreamers. 

The men lay sleeping in a simu- 
lated night. Eleven forms tied into 
cocoons tied neatly to the bulkhead 
in designated rows. One sleep- 
net lay empty. Avo looked at it, a 
withered weightless pod. He lis- 
tened in the dim light, a gloom that 
was almost dark. He could hear the 
men breathing in their dreams. 
Planet dreams. Wild rivers of Earth 
and cumulus clouds towering over 
green islands set in silver blue 
sea . baked powdery plains 
stretched before lunar craters, the 
rims of the craters etched against 
the black night of space . ruddy 
dreams of Mars when the lichen 



fields bloomed and children in their 
aitpaks scampered over the mounds 
of tektites digging for rubies. Mars, 
Moon, Earth. 

They slept, these planetmen in a 
frosted tank in space. Avo looked 
again at the empty sleepnet. 
“Stupid Earth man,” he whispered. 
“I’m sony you’re dead.’’ His voice 
surprised him. It was like the 
wheezy breathing of the sleepers. 
“Tassmor,” he thought, “you 
knew it all! Captain, manager, 
navigator. You were stilt an Earth- 
man.” Avo wondered in the night 
and knew he could not sleep. He 
peeked at his timex; three hours and 
twelve minutes before wake-up, be- 
fore the tank lighted up for day side. 
Tassmor would never wake up. 

Sixteen days they had floated like 
this since the blast and breakup of 
the platform. They all had plenty of 
time to make it back to the house, 
or command module in the en- 
gineer's lingo. The breakup took 
five days, irrevocable destruction. A 
biliion-dolJar cluster of machinery 
blown to pieces, a million tons of 
water, a million tons of assorted 
ores, mostly chromium, worth who 
knew how much? It was plain disas- 
ter. They were lucky no one was 
killed outright. Tassmor had died on 
the fourth day, out in space in his 
air suit. He was supervising Avo 
and Hennings as they cut away a 
giant section of superstructure that 
threatened to keep them spinning 
with an uncontrollable yaw. 
Tassmor shouldn’t have been out 



10 



GALAXY 



there, It was an Earthman stunt, a 
show of (he dynamic man in full 
command of a disaster. 

Tassmor was thirsty for Ihe ad- 
venture of space. He should have 
stayed within the house, or rather, 
since he was first and forever an 
engineer, his command module. To 
any spacer it was the house. 
Tassmor had come out to see the 
adventure of Avo, ship's first 
officer and only Martian navigator; 
Avo with twenty-three annuals in 
space, ten of those years on the ice 
shuttles to Saturn; Avo and Hen- 
nings, a junior roustabout from 
Moon, had to cut away the hanging 
piece of superstructure with laser 
torches. It was a grandstand event 
for Tassmor. What a tale to tell the 
Earthlings after the rescue, after his 
retirement to the rolling horseback 
hills of Virginia. Tassmor had the 
rescue all figured out until (he G 
force of (he yaw gave an unknowa- 
ble torque to the fragment of in- 
genious machine that spun out and 
cracked him across the back, 
squeezing him dead in his air suit 
against the hull of the housetank. 
The suit popped like a little balloon. 
Avo had advised against Tassmor 
coming out. It was just one man too 
many for Ihe job. But Tassmor was 
both captain and manager. 

That was part of the Earthman 
mystique which the owners of the 
corporate mining vehicles and plat- 
forms created. The captains were 
always Earthmen. No Martian had 
ever been assigned command of a 



mining complex nor was likely to, 
given the current state of politics. 
Mars had two break-away colonies 
now. Two independent cities grown 
up outside the authority of the 
Constitutional government. The 
three recognized Martian city-states, 
Marsport, Crater, and Vostokgrad, 
were unwilling to abandon their 
maverick offspring, indeed unable 
to especially considering lhat the 
two rebel colonies each had nuclear 
missile capacity as well as their 
own comsats and wide ranging sup- 
port from spacers far and near. 

The first independent colony, 
called Vandis and NovaMars Com- 
munity, had sprouted up one winter 
taking Earth completely by surprise. 
This historical precedent was clear 
and present, however, and the sur- 
prise only served to prove how far 
Earth was from the realities of Mars 
and the potential riches available 
these past fifty annuals from as- 
teroid mines. 

In one annual the first new col- 
ony had created its own breeder 
reactors, its own glass factory, its 
own miles of agriculture domes. 
They made good contracts with 
wildcat miners and arranged to 
carry their own nuclear wastes to a 
docking orbit out among the rocks 
in asteroid space. The Earth - 
generated embargoes, boycotts and 
restrictions prohibited them from 
trading nuclear by-products down to 
Moon Industries. Moon did what 
Earth decided Moon would do. But 
Mars was another story. 



AND EARTH SO FAR AWAY 



11 



The second rebel colony had 
sprouted the following spring in the 
southern hemisphere and that wasn't 
even broadcast on Earth. It didn't 
have a name. It existed, however, a 
true rebel city founded by renegade 
Russians and privateer pirates from 
America. The two made natural, 
historical allies; the Ruskies were 
calculating scientists, slow moving 
but secure in their methods and long 
range plans, the American pirates 
unpredictable, daring and rich with 
treasures dug out of space. Both re- 
veled in conspiracies and the out- 
ward display of arms. 

The southern Mars hemisphere 
was virtually uninhabited. Only a 
few isolated weatherstations or Earth- 
side scientific teams existed there. 
The pirate city had such awesome 
potential that many rumors were fly- 
ing of an armed Earth expeditionary 
force. But that was rumor. Earth 
was so far away and the renegade 
colonies still quite small. 



Avo zipped out of his sleepnet 
and moved weightless to the opera- 
tions deck. The robot pilot moni- 
tored their position and the life sys- 
tems. All other functions were 
dead. They could send microwave, 
but not receive. Their distress signal 
was heard all over space but rescue 
would be long in coming, despite 
Tassmor's polyanna plans. 

Already, those plans had jeopar- 
dized the remaining lives on board. 
12 



The torque twisting wreckage that 
killed Tassmor had tom away the 
high gain antennae. Avo and Hen- 
nings had rigged a sending beam on 
the seventh day. But so far they 
hadn’t put together a receiving dish. 
And this crew so advanced in all 
space techniques! 

Six were miners from the NATO 
group, all Earthmen with pictures of 
wives and children and grandparents 
pressed in plastic frames. Good 
workers, honest men who sent big 
credits back to Earth. Two were 
Americans, young, healthy, tireless 
and bound to become Martians, 
both of them, as soon as their visas 
were cleared. The two others were 
Moonmen who didn't like being 
called Moonies or Lunies and worst 
of all Moaners. It was Moonman or 
fight with those dudes, fantastic 
rock miners excellent with explo- 
sives, natural no-grav spacemen 
who were also quiet, credit-wise, 
and not much interested in Mars or 
Earth. And then there was 
Avo . first officer and navigator, 
the one and only Martian, very soon 
to be a deserter. 

There was no other way. Tassmor 
had set them on a rescue plan that 
was filled with Earth logic and this 
was outer space, the edge of the as- 
teroid belt. Mars was way across 
the sun on the far side of its orbit 
relative to the position that the 
housetank was holding. There were 
sixteen other mine platforms in 
space, all save one plowing the 
uranium and cobalt strike in the 



GALAXY 



dense rock fields of sector 440. The 
other miner was a slim possibility if 
the damage to their own complex 
had been moderate, but this had 
been a major disaster. The machine 
was totaled and they were lucky, 
only lucky, to escape without more 
deaths. They could never reach the 
nearest miner without propulsion 
and scanner reception. 

There was only one way from 
A vo's space-minded focus point. He 
would have to desert and he would 
have to go now. If he didn't he 
would be a dead man in a hollow, 
frost covered, tank floating through 
the rocks with ten other dead men, 
all zipped neatly into their sleep- 
nets. 

Avo took a long last look at the 
latest guidance print-out and logged 
the All-System position coordinates 
in his mind. Now was the time 
while the others were sleeping. He 
floated to the equipment deck and 
donned his airsuit, then opened the 
inner hatch of the airlock, stepped 
in, locked it, and pressed the vac- 
uum pump. The outer hatch eased 
open and he pulled himself out into 
space. A thirty- foot, all puipose 
mint-tug was tethered to the frosty 
housetank hull. He unsnapped the 
tethers and pushed off, climbed up 
to the bubble of the jumpseat and 
popped it open. When he was 
seated at the controls, he pulled the 
bubble down and activated the air- 
pump. When the pressure equalized, 
he detached his space helmet and 
began his slow, quiet drift away 



toward life and freedom. If his 
gambit was successful, he would 
survive the disaster and perhaps, 
Good Space, perhaps save the lives 
of the men he was leaving behind. 

The mini-tug< were propelled by 
hydrogen kept under great pressure 
in cryogenic tanks. A small turbine, 
working from the same expanding 
gas system, provided the energy to 
spin the generators that turned out 
the electricity necessary to govern 
the craft and give it life. It was not 
a long distance vehicle. Its air and 
propulsion systems were limited, 
designed for work near the mining 
platform. They also served as life- 
boats on occasion but only for one 
man. There were twelve on the plat- 
forms according to regulations, al- 
though it was rare that more than 
two or three were ever used at a 
time; platform disasters weren't 
supposed to happen. 

Avo spun the silver cylinder craft 
about and headed aft of the glisten- 
ing housetank. There was a 
comsat-astrogation buoy three days 
back in space. If he could rendez- 
vous with it, his gambit would suc- 
ceed. Every space buoy had All- 
System communications on board as 
well as emergency air, food and wa- 
ter. It was regulation, a foresight 
seldom found in systems designed 
by planet grounders for men who 
lived and died in space. 

He peeked again at his timex. In 
two and a half hours, the dayside 
lights would warm up and the sleep- 
ing men would emerge from their 



AND EARTH SO FAR AWAY 



13 



nighttime cocoons and discover his 
absence. They would, some of 
(hem, curse him for desertion. 
Perhaps Hennings, (he Moonie rock 
hunter would know what was hap- 
pening. Maybe Pardee, a space wise 
mechanic from Oklahoma, would 
catch on. 

The others would rely on planet 
based rescue even though Earth and 
Mars were so far distant. They 
would keep believing it for a month 
or more until they expired one by 
one from despair or from a pill or 
from asphyxiation. 

Even a three hundred foot spar- 
kling white tank could disappear amid 
the rocks. 

When he had drifted about and 
was far enough away, Avo fired the 
hydrogen jets and the clumsy 
bubble-headed cylinder sped off into 
dark space. Three days would tell if 
he was a deserter or a medal win- 
ner. If he survived and they died, 
he would never again get a post on 
a corporate miner, never again be 
welcome on any NATO craft. 

In moments of extreme life 
threatening situations a spacer was 
supposed to save his ass. That was 
law and ethic. He wouldn't be 
faulted if he survived the blow-out 
and disintegration while the others 
perished: one man, one life boat. 
However, he wouldn’t exactly be 
honored, and would never get into 
space again on any Constitution 
craft. 

“If the spacers pick me up and 
not the crew,” he thought, ‘Til 

14 



have to go rebel now unless I stay 
on Mars. I wouldn't exactly have 
much to do down there. Claim a 
disability or something.” His mind 
was computing relative values. “I’d 
have to go rebel, if they’d take me 
on. The renegade Russians would 
hire me — that’s for sure. A 
navigator with my trip record would 
get top credits.” He liked Ruskies 
in space. Good chessmen, no com- 
plainers. 



Yet Avo was tangled in the webs 
of his own history. He was a 
moonbom child of five when his 
parents left Moonport Tycho on the 
first colony ships to Mars. His 
great-grandfather was a Moon ex- 
ploration geologist. His grandfather 
an astrophysicist in the first moon 
colony, his grandmother a moon 
botanist. The webs of the past 
bound him to a certain sense of 
place in the vast regions of dark 
space and planet expansion. First 
Moon colony, moonbom. Mars col- 
ony child, a space navigator from 
earliest manhood; at twenty-two a 
spacehand on the first ice expedition 
to the Rings of Saturn when spacer 
Martians had proved that ice in 
ocean quantity was transportable, 
useable. That event had dissolved 
the Earth umbilical cord forever. If 
he failed to bring the miner crew 
home to Mars, he would end his 
life planet-bound or a navigator for 
privateers. 



GALAXY 



Avo tinned the video back toward 
the housetank and watched it 
sparkle away on the monitor. “No 
way,” he said, “no way they’re 
gonna find that tank until maybe 
next year.” The news of the blow- 
out was no doubt a hot bit of ex- 
citement in the Corporate headquar- 
ters on Marsport and personal con- 
cern, grief and worry in Crater. He 
knew the NATO rescue teams were 
scanning the rocks, but from a very 
great distance. The blowout of a bil- 
lion-dollar space machine would be 
evening news for a few days on 
Moon and Earth. Consulates would 
exchange data, crew lists, cargo po- 
tential. The loss of unknown tons of 
chromium would sicken the 
stomachs of the corporate directors. 
Inquiries would have already been 
through preliminary statements. 
Theories as to the nature of the dis- 
aster would bound via microwave 
from Mars to Moon to Earth and 
back. But as yet very little would 
be happening in a rescue effort. Not 
yet. They were all so far away. 

But the astrogation buoy was 
right ahead, somewhere in the 
rocks. He asked for the coordinates 
from the astrogator and opened the 
All-System guide communicator 
bands for a pulse. “The trouble 
with mini-tugs is that they are de- 
signed for close platform support. 
The microwave units are limited. 
Receivers too small and too direc- 
tional.” Avo made a note to report 
all that to the investigators. If he 
ever got to talk to them. 



The mini -tugs could sustain a 
man for five days. The space buoy 
would keep him another week, 
perhaps two. It was up to the inde- 
pendent spacers if he lived or not. 
Up to the renegade Russians and 
their privateer American financers. 
This region of the rocks was rich in 
chromium. There was sure to be a 
pirate floating around somewhere, 
sure to be a wildcat mine working a 
cluster of rocks somewhere. They 
all tuned in to the buoys set out and 
maintained by the Constitution. 

Everyone had the right to 
navigate — astrogate they were call- 
ing it now. Everyone had the right 
to survive in space. He would gen- 
erate all the rescue teams he would 
need. If only he could find them, 
and they could reach him. 

Avo set the pulse generator se- 
quence for the propulsion robot, ex- 
tended the antennae mast and 
locked his guidance coordinates into 
the pilot. He knew he would find 
the buoy, day after tomorrow. He 
climbed out of the bubble-domed 
circular cockpit and went below into 
the tiny mini-tug housetank. He 
touched the illumination panel, read 
a soft vapor light, and then 
stretched out the sleepnet. 

He would sleep in his airsuit, 
keeping the helmet an arm’s reach 
away; too many mini-tugs took sud- 
den punctures and decompressions 
for the luxury of naked sleep. 

He zipped into the sleepnet and 
floated back, letting himself relax in 
space fashion, slow pranic breath- 



AND EARTH SO FAR AWAV

ing dispelling tensions throughout 
his body, relaxing feet first, work- 
ing upward giving advice to his 
muscles to stop doing what they 
were doing to cause tension; knees, 
genitals, abdomen, thorax, neck, 
back. He was soon in near-sleep. 
His body would be grateful for a 
good sleep. 

His mind, however, was still a 
turmoil over his decision to leave 
the others behind. He had ap- 
proached it in singular Martian -way 
logic. He was (he only one capable 
of piloting a clumsy mini-tug 
through days of space and locating 
an astrogation buoy fifty feet long 
amid a mass of asteroid rocks. He 
was at that time senior officer, and 
pro-tem captain. The decision was 
correct. He hadn't needed the kind 
of group approval so common with 
Earthmen. 

He imagined the disabled house- 
tank and knew the men were awake 
now, cursing him no doubt, squeez- 
ing the fear back down inside them, 
perhaps understanding what he had 
done. 

Near- sleep began to quiet him. 
He saw the positive pole of his plan 
and locked onto it. He would save 
the crew. He would take rest from 
space and lay down on Mars 
awhile. Maybe he would go to 
Earth and read history for a few 
years. History was his personal joy. 
The long years in space had given 
him ample time to read the micro- 
film libes from a to z. But books! 
Real books in the library of a 



university or a corporation, even a 
city! That was a dream he'd had 
since his days amid the Rings chop- 
ping ice. 

After the rescue and the inquiry 
on Mars, he'd visa down to Earth 
for a time. He was rich enough in 
credits. Spacers had strange rumors 
of Earth. They said it was a filthy 
place and you could get any number 
of unmentionable diseases there, 
some of which turned your lungs 
black, some of which rotted your 
skin or made your hair fall out. 



Avo had never been to Earth. 
He’d left Moon at five and barely 
remembered the blue-white marble 
in the sky. He’d heard that the air 
on Earth was so thick you could 
drown in it, so thick you couldn't 
see through it and that water fell out 
of the sky, sometimes for days on 
end. He couldn’t really believe that 
last part. But he’d never seen an 
ocean nor a jungle nor a river in his 
life. There was more to the System 
than space. 

After the rescue, he’d go down to 
Earth. He’d visit Pardee in Ok- 
lahoma and ride horses. He’d read 
history books until his eyes fell out. 

He knew Martians were rare on 
Earth. Six billion Earihpeople and 
only 152,000 total Martians, less 
than 1,000 down on Earth. Pardee 
had told him that getting used to 
Earthgrav was just a matter of 
working at it . he’d have to take 



16 



GALAXY 



calcium to strengthen the bones, 
and run everyday. 

“Just a hundred yards for the 
first week,” Pardee had told him, 
"two hundred the second week, 
then four hundred on up. By the 
end of six weeks you do a mile a 
day, hell’s bells! Most Earth people 
don’t do that! Then you work out 
with weights for six months espe- 
cially on the legs, you got it made. 
You come on down OkTahoma and 
my Pa an’ me ’ll work your ass off 
on our ranch. We got a herd of 
horses and cattle and there's hay to 
buck and barley to cut. Sheet. You 
just show up on Earth and call me. 
You got yereelf a home!” Now 
Pardee was trapped in a frosted 
steel housetank with six NATO’s 
and two Moonies and one other 
Merican; the rolling hay fields so 
far away. 

Maybe, when he was down to 
Earth, Avo dreamed, he’d find a 
few Earthgirls to bring up to Mars. 
They had them down there all sizes, 
shapes and colors! 

He knew of a crater about one 
hundred kilos from Vandis, the 
Nova Mars colony, just south of the 
farthest reaches of the north polar 
cap, where the shadows sheltered a 
great bank of ice. The crater was 
maybe six kilos across, with one 
wall crumbled and a flat central 
basin filled with good glass sand. In 
the summer, when the pole tilted 
down toward the sun, enough ice 
melted to nourish a bloom of lichen 
that would cover the basin with a

red and purple carpet six to ten cen- 
timeters deep. 

He could go independent, neither 
rebel nor Constitution, set up a few 
domes with his Eanhwives and live 
on his pension credits reading his- 
tory. His wives could set up a glass 
factory and they'd make their own 
planthouses and their own plates 
and cups. The icefield would give 
them water, energy in reduction to 
hydrogen and with the oxygen they 
could make their own air. 

That was the Martian way, the 
dream of traditional Martian 
spacers. His mind reached sleep. He 
fell into dreaming planet dreams of 
plump, smiling longhaired girls of 
Earth. 

Avo slept all through the second 
day. There was no need for him to 
awaken. The robopilot kept the craft 
at speed and locked onto the course 
he had set for it. Sleep healed him 
and rested his mind. On the third 
day he awakened and stretched out 
of the sleepnet. He floated into the 
cockpit and checked his data 
monitors. A huge smile spread 
across his face. He had the buoy 
signal strong and unmistakable! 

He computed twelve hours of 
travel time before he would have to 
maneuver and lock into the thing. 
Matching speed would be tricky; 
twenty-three years of space craft 
and he was topping his career off 
with a mini -tug and buoy. 

If the mini -tugs had better com- 
munications gear, he might have 
been able to raise someone by now. 
18 



Twice in the past he had been in on 
rescues; once an indy wildcatter 
with plumbing problems causing a 
shutdown of their fuel rods; once a 
pirate Ruskie shot through with 
meteor holes. It hadn’t mattered that 
they weren't Constitution. 

Avo began to brake at the 
seventh hour, at the tenth he made 
eye contact with the blinking red 
strobe light, at the twelfth he began 
to match speed and rendezvous. 

When he was simultaneous with 
the buoy, he fastened his airhelmet, 
locked the housetank hatch and 
pumped out to vacuum. He popped 
the bubble dome and floated out to 
space. He was about one hundred 
meters below the buoy; he’d placed 
the tug there to avoid the piercing 
long distance microwave beams. He 
tethered to the tug and pushed off, 
floating to the buoy, catching on to 
a ring hold. He had made it half- 
way. 

Now he could send out the data 
on the blowout, the coordinates of 
the housetank, the names of the 
survivors. He was sorry he couldn’t 
include Tassmor on (he list. He 
found the service hatch and popped 
it. The interior was alive with pin- 
lights and electric humming. 

The rescue effort took three 
weeks. Avo waited on the buoy for 
eight days before an indy prospector 
homed in and took him off. The 
indy ship wasn’t big enough to hold 
the other crewmen, and was headed 
Mars-side anyway. Avo regretted 
that he wouldn't be going back to 



GALAXY 



the floating housetank to spring his 
partners. 

A roving rebel-colony mining 
platform crossed four and a hall 
million kilometers to take the men 
on board. It was four months before 
they were able to transfer to a 
NATO patrol ship and ferry down 
to Mars . 



A vo was waiting for them when 
they touched down. He had long 
since made his report and testified 
at the preliminary inquiry. Now that 
the others were down, he would 
have to do it again. The thin clear 
winds of Mars blew red dust devils 
across the landing strip. The shuttle 
came down gracefully, its great 
moveable wings spread wide, 
thrusters flaring in sequence. The 
touchdown was perfeet. 

A vo waited until the craft taxied 
into the cargo hanger, then went 
across the tarmac and slipped his 
titanium credit plaque into the 
robosecurity gate. He found a good 
vantage point behind the video 
crews, his slender 6 '5" tucked near 
a service van. The outer hatches 
were popped and the men came 
down the portaramp. The video 
newsmen immediately pounced on 
the surprise news . only eight of 
the ten returned! The two Moonies 
had jumped contracts and signed on 
with the rebel platform crew that 
had rescued them! 

The NATO patrol commander 



had classified the story in coded 
messages to Earth, but had not 
broadcast the change in status over 
the common communicators. Hen- 
nings and Dasco had forfeited their 
lunar citizenship, forfeited their 
bank credits and gone rebel! Avo 
felt a racing wave of excitement 
break over him. The new colony 
was eager for accomplished spacers 
to man their mining craft. The 
Moonies were naturals for recruit- 
ment, young men with no wives or 
kids and not enough in the bank, 
even to metal wise moonies, to keep 
them from taking the leap. 

The rebel mining effort had 
gained immeasurably from this dis- 
aster. A rich source of chromium 
was now coordinated, their own 
platform was now mining the sec- 
tor, and they had gained two free- 
space demolition experts with im- 
mediate experience and corporate 
engineering degrees. Avo was more 
than just interested in the new col- 
ony, he was overwhelmed by its re- 
sourcefulness and spirit. He would 
get the whole story from the Meri- 
cans, Pardee and Rander. He saw 
Pardee’s bright blue eyes flashing 
and his happy face crack open in a 
smile. 

The video crews made a big deal 
of the touchdown. The news would 
speed to Earth and Moon without 
delay. The reunion of the latest 
space blowout survivors with the 
Martian who had maneuvered a 
mini- tug through three days of 
space, pinpointed their location and 



AND EARTH SO FAR AWAY

effected their rescue! It was coo 
much for grounder imaginations, 
even Martian grounders. The story 
would illuminate two billion video 
screens and fill pages of newsprint. 

It would also be stored in micro- 
libes, occupy the gossip of Corpo- 
rate boardrooms and design labs, 
worey consulates and governors. 
The rescue had been carried out by 
rebels. Two otherwise reliable, skil- 
led .space hands had jumped con- 
tract. The implications were too 
complicated for instant analysis. 

A vo, Rander, and Pardee rode in 
comfort back to Marsport, sitting 
inside a corporate executive touring 
car. The vast cluster of ferro-glass 
domes danced in the pink haze 
across the crater floor. The Corpora- 
tion was putting them up at the 
Dunes Hotel and the attorneys and 
investigators were eager to get more 
of the details of the disaster. Avo 
had told his version over and over, 
but he was a Martian, given to little 
speculation and not much talk. The 
investigators would have a ball with 
the hard talking Mericans. 

The NATO crew members went 
to NATO village as everyone had 
expected, the NATO's being a tight 
security group, tighter than even the 
Russians down in Vostokgrad. The 
video crew loved the six smiling 
NATO’s with their handsome faces 
and symmetrical, well muscled 
bodies, and especially the photos 
they showed in the plastic frames of 
children and grandfathers, wives 
and cousins down on Earth. There 



weren’t a lot of single Martian girls 
in this business and bureaucracy 
town, but most of them went out to 
NATO village that weekend. Over 
one hundred hands aboard the patrol 
ship came down for a week on the 
ground. 

The cool faint sun was sinking 
pale red in the evening pink salmon 
sky. “Sheet,” said Pardee. “Me’n 
Rander would of jumped, too. Ex- 
cept we already got Mars visas. I 
couldn’t see losing the credits in my 
accounts, but let me tell you I give 
it a long, long thought.” 

The three men sat in the garden 
bar on the fourth terrace of the 
Hotel. It was one of the tallest 
buildings under the dome and they 
had a good view of the corporation 
garden district from the windows. It 
didn’t take them long to tie one on. 
Pardee and Rander hadn’t had a 
drink in almost a year. Avo was 
smoking black lichen and drinking 
expensive tequila imported from 
Mexico. "You know we thought 
about it,” Rander added. “We 
gotta keep it under our helmets, ya 
know? We don’t know what’s 
gonna fold over at the inquest. Cor- 
poration is pissed at the blowout.” 

“Yeah, it's a variable at this 
point,” said Pardee. “The Corpora- 
tion doesn't exactly know what’s 
floating, see? Those NATO’s have 
been strictly segregated. They 
couldn't do that with us ’cuz we’re 
Mericans, but we were on board the 
rebel platform for four months be- 
fore the patroller took us on. Let 



20 



GALAXY 




me tell you those rebels got some- 
thing together as far as space min- 
ing goes. The hands get a share of 
the tonnage swept up, and a share 
of the smelt. Besides that, they got 
some balls out there, Avo my 
friend, real balls. We seen ’em de- 
tonate a chunk of rock twice as big 
as we would have dared tackle and 
swept up every crumb of it.” 

“We was goin’ to work for our 
keep while we was on board," said 
Rander, "but they advised us of 
their political situation real friendly 
and accurate. We had a briefing on 
video from one of their attorneys, 
told us the whole shot. He advised 
that we didn’t work and the captain 
up there tol’ us don't even bother 
worryin’ about it. They wasn't 
about to attach any of our credits 
even! 'But the NATO’s they didn’t 



trust nohow! Wouldn’t let them see 
any of their operations.” 

The smoke from the heady black 
lichen coupled with two shots of 
tequila had Avo spinning. He felt a 
sense he hadn’t known since that 
first fantastic trip out to the Rings 
with the expeditionary flight. That 
had been a revolution in space 
travel. The Earthbound, scientist 
control of Mars had been shattered. 
Something like that was happening 
again. More subtle perhaps, but a 
new energy was coming through. 
And it was coming from the break- 
away Vandis colony. 



The following morning, Avo was 
dreaming. He was floating through 
the icy tank miles long, diffused 



AND EARTH SO FAR AWAY 



21 



with blue light. The dead face of 
Tassmor ghosted through the ice 
walls. He could see blood from the 
Earth man's crushed lungs frozen at 
the comer of his smiling mouth. 

He awakened and saw the morning 
light at the window, felt the bed 
beneath him, looked at the plants 
hanging by the windows. He sud- 
denly felt very old and creaky in the 
joints, not at all like a spacer celeb- 
rity, the subject of news reports and 
target of eager well-wishers. 

The Hotel bar had been packed 
with handshaking businessmen and 
grounder bureaucrats. A dozen 
times he and Pardee had their in- 
stamatic photos snapped. At first 
he’d enjoyed the drinks offered and 
the pipes of black lichen. He’d 
never in his life had so much atten- 
tion and he was too much a spacer 
to really enjoy it, always in space 
with only a small dome lodge down 
in Sandy ville near Crater to call a 
pianethome. 

Pardee soaked up the spotlight 
and took some of the heat off Avo 
with half a dozen rare tales of the 
months on the rebel platform, his 
ranch in Oklahoma and the delicacy 
known as mountain oysters. Rander 
caught the eye of a supple young 
lady on leave from the equatorial 
weather station. They cut out before 
midnight. Avo and Pardee got too 
drunk to handle any women, al- 
though there were several rare 
beauties in the bar. Avo was think- 
ing of women more and more often 
now. 



The morning light spread into the 
room. He had never spent a night in 
such luxury. The bed was wide and 
deep with soft sheets and fat pil- 
lows. It was a- giant room with tall 
windows and a balcony. “Exec’s 
life is soft,” he murmured. “No 
wonder they all look so polished, 
buffed over by centuries between 
soft sheets is why.” 

He stretched. The Marsgrav tug- 
ged at him a little and pulled him 
down. He had to get used to things 
falling. He was still sticking things 
out in the air like a glass or a pen 
and being startled when it fell to the 
floor. Even with six months down, 
he was still in weightless space. Six 
months was the longest he’d stayed 
down in twelve years. He was feel- 
ing thick in the head from the 
tequila and very old. It was time to 
make new plans, somehow, but he 
couldn’t think what. Avo reached 
for a ginseng-vitamin pill to cure 
his aching hangover and lay back to 
sleep until noon. 

The videophone was calling him. 
Avo awakened again and snapped 
on the monitor. It was Pardee. “Get 
yer ass outa bed, spaceman, and 
come on down to the sauna. 1 got 
some news for you.” 

"What news?” Avo murmured. 
“I’m not getting up.” 

“Cain’t tell ya on this system. 
Meet me down in the sauna. Come 
on now, it’s important.” 

Avo hadn't been figuring to leave 
his room until hunger drove him 
out. But the invitation to the sauna 



22 



GALAXY 



sounded good and the added spice 
of some Earthman intrigue was too 
much motivation to resist. He stood 
up and found a clean jumpsuit, 
slipped on his desert boots and went 
out to the elevator. 

The sauna and exercise spa was 
on the ground floor across the 
eucalyptus garden from the pool. 
There were only three pools in all 
of Marsport and on weekends this 
was a popular social spot. Avo had 
figured to hang out there on Sunday 
to entertain some single young 
ladies. He crossed through the 
lobby and out into the fragrant gar- 
den. Eucalyptus grew well in Mar- 
tian soil. 

Pardee was waiting for him in a 
private box. Avo showered first 
and, wrapped in a thick velour to- 
wel, stepped into the 180° heat. 
Pardee sat naked on the beach hold- 
ing his head. 

“That lichen I smoked kicked my 
head from here to Enceladus. Sit 
down, bro,’ you ready for some 
tales?” Avo really wasn’t. The poli- 
tics and leverage games that went 
on between the three inhabited 
worlds had never really interested 
him. Pardee took a deep breath. “I 
had to meet you here because 1 
don't trust the hotel phone system. 
Rander split this morning with that 
meteorologist! Yesterday afternoon, 
as soon as we checked in here, he 
slipped out to a bank and got his 
credits transferred Mars-side. Like I 
tol’ you we both already got Mars 
visas. This morning, the transfer 



comes through, he draws it all out 
and him and the girl take off! To 
Vandis!” 

Avo’s head was clearing fast. 
The only place to take off to on this 
planet was to the new colony. 

“He’s gone over to Vandis? 
What about the inquest?” He re- 
alized it was a dumb question. Ran- 
der had other things on his mind. 
“There ain’t gonna be no inquest. 
Least not here. I had an Earth man 
CB1 team in my room (his morning 
trying to find out if I was going to 
run. too. I had to claim rights to get 
them out. The Corporation is get- 
ting set to file sabotage charges.” 

“Against who?” Avo said quick- 

ly- 

“ Ain’t sure yet. The NATO’s 
have ordered their crew back to 
Moon. They refuse to meet inter- 
viewers. It might be a showdown 
between the Corporates and the 
NATO’s.” 

“They always stick together,” 
Avo calculated. “They’re gonna try 
to bake the NMC at Vandis and 
blame them. Then they get the em- 
bargoes enforced, see?” 

“Could be. I can't tell, being 
basically dumb at politicos. But 
somethin’s goin’ down and i wanted 
you in on what I know.” 

“The CBI can’t question me 
without a civil justice warrant and 
they can't get that. Martian spacer 
rights are tough to violate. But I 
still ought to get an attorney just in 
case any charges come down — 
neglect of duty or something. The

truth is I don't know what caused 
the preliminary explosion. All 1 
could tell them was about the stages 
of the breakup afterwards. And 
Tassmor’s death.” 

"Hennings made a report about 
that to the NMC manager. So 
you’re covered good on that one. 
He will make that report available if 
you request it.” 

"Since I’ve been down here sev- 
eral months, there’s probably no 
worry about me going over. I’m 
first colony anyway. My Martian 
rights citizenship would make it im- 
possible for CBI to extradite me for 
anything. Trouble is I was seriously 
considering a trip Earth side.” 

“You were?” Pardee was beam- 
ing. “Listen, you got to come visit 
my folks and all.” 

“I was figuring I would. I want 
to see what Earth is all about for 
myself. There’s damn few Martians 
ever been to Earth. I thought I’d lay 
out down there a few years. Read 
history, find a wife or two.” 

“Find some women?” Pardee 
laughed. “Why, Bro,‘ do you have 
any idea how many thousands of 
Earth girls would many you just to 
get up to Mars?” 

“Thousands?” Avo wasn’t going 
for the number. 

“Thou sands ! ’ ’ Pardee repeated. 
“It’s the mystique. Spacers are rare 
birds. I can’t tell you the fascination 
most Earthpeople have for spacers. 
Even a platform mechanic like me. 

“1 wanted to be in space since 1 
was six years old. I been expecting 
24 



to go Martian these past few annu- 
als, bring my wife and kids up 
here. Hey, the best astrogation and 
priori ng schools are on Mars these 
days- Mars is the future world, far 
as space goes.” 

“You come on down to San- 
dy ville with me,” said Avo. “If 
there’s no inquest, there’s no need 
to hang around here. Down there I 
can show you some real Mars. I got 
my lodge down there and we can 
trip out to the desert. Mars is a 
place just beginning. Let’s enjoy the 
Corporation’s hospitality today. I 
want to get in that pool this af- 
ternoon. Tomonow morning we’ll 
catch the shuttle down to Crater.” 



Sandy ville was a spacer enclave 
tucked into a low escarpment due 
west of Crater. Avo and Pardee 
boarded the first shuttle in the 
morning, making the four hundred 
kilometers flight to Mars’ second 
city in half an hour. 

Crater was more populated than 
Marspon, being a center of spacer 
activity and independent mine or- 
ganizations. The crater it sat in was 
fifty kilos across and die rim wall, 
banded pink and red, curved around 
in a jagged ridge that varied from 
two thousand to more than nine 
thousand meters. All manner of 
trade goods changed hands at Cra- 
ter: air packs, dome kits, assorted 
vehicles, mining equipment, spare 
pans for a thousand and one 



GALAXY 



machines, vegetables from outlying 
glassfarms. fertilizers, seed, farm 
implements, glassware, clothing, 
sand boots, imports from Moon and 
Earth, carved ruby, Martian metals, 
black lichen, contraband of every 
description; families, children, 
beautiful slender girls, myths, 
legends of the colonists, well kept 
saloons and wild, wild stories of 
space, asteroids and the dunes of 
Mars. 

■‘The story about the man, Van- 
dis,” Avo told Pardee as they sat 
shoulder to shoulder in the tight 
seats of the shuttle, “is the story of 
the original independent exploration 
of the planet. Vandis broke away 
from the clutches of the scientists 
almost a century before the Rings 
Expedition. Everyone thought he 
was dead for ten years after he dis- 
appeared from the First Geological 
Survey. Marsport was the only base 
then. Totally military- scientist con- 
trolled. Vandis believed Mars 
would support a colony and pre- 
dicted that humans would live here, 
prosper and break away from 
Earth-scientist domination. He 
explored the entire circumference of 
the north polar cap and built his 
own water and air makers." 

"So, that’s why they call the 
NMC colony Vandis," said Pardee. 

"Exactly," Avo continued. "Van- 
dis became expert in dry land 
ecology in the days of his explora- 
tions. Most of the mystery legends 
come from him and his first follow- 
ers.” 

AND EARTH SO FAR AWAY 



“Like the Lost Martians, the 
dead city on the equator, the dune 
creatures and all that?” Pardee was 
as wide-eyed as a space child of 
six. 

"Right, Vandis came back to 
Marsport ten years after he had 
been declared dead. The military 
tried to assassinate him. He scared 
(hem to death! He came in at 
Marsport one morning on the tail 
end of a sandstorm. Everybody 
thought he was some kind of true 
Martian creature. In a sense he was; 
the first Earth man to live on Mars. 
On Mars alone without Earth- 
supplied existence. He did what was 
said to be impossible. 

"Instead of welcoming the man 
back as a visionary and a hero, they 
jailed him! He was a terrible threat 
to the safe little scientist base. They 
didn’t want anyone coming to Mars 
except their own people under strict 
supervision. Two of the younger 
members of the enclave, an as- 
tronaut captain and a young female 
geologist, sprang Vandis out of the 
jail that the base commander had 
constructed just for him. They dis- 
appeared and walked away into the 
desert. The commander went out 
after them, but never found a trace. 
So for the second time, this one 
classified for twenty- five years, 
Vandis was declared dead! 

“The three explorers knew they 
would be discovered if they stayed 
near the polar cap so they turned 
south and set up several bases. 
After a year, several more people 

25 



from the enclave disappeared, along 
with various pieces of equipment. 
“Gone to Vandis” was the term 
that grew up to explain it. And 
every year after that, top flight 
people would desert. Soon there 
was no denying that Vandis was 
alive with his followers, somewhere 
on Mars.” 

Pardee was watching the ragged 
dunes and red walled craters flow 
past below the round window next 
to his elbow. The Vandis legend 
was a myth of his childhood but 
here he was flying over the very 
territory that the first Martian 
ecologist had surveyed. 

“The greatest Vandis tale, to me 
anyway, is the Ruby Caverns,” 
Avo added. 

“Somewhere down in the equator 
belt is a system of lost caverns. The 
Martians had used the caverns as a 
storage bin for (he last traces of 
their society. The legend says that 
Vandis is still alive and down there 
with them. It could be, you know, 
(he equator has been extensively 
mapped and photographed, but ac- 
tually explored very little. The 
sandstorms are incredible, water 
factor just about zero. But there is 
no doubt there is just as much ruby 
there as anywhere else. Whole 
mountain ranges of ruby.” 

Ruby was the first big discovery 
on Mars, one kept secret for de- 
cades from fear of its economic im- 
pact on Earth. For 150 annuals the 
scientists who controlled Mars 
maintained a rich monopoly in a 



ruby trade. Mars ruby was highly 
adaptable for industrial use in ail 
manner of lasting devices. It was so 
common on Mars that entire cliffs 
and miles of encrusted ridges were 
composed of the hard red carborun- 
dum. A lively legal trade in carved 
rubies for jewelry had gone on since 
the days of the first colony. Martian 
craftspeople turned out plates, cups, 
goblets, paperweights, necklaces, 
sculptures, all manner of artifacts 
for sale on the three worlds. The 
money managers of Earth had strict 
tariffs on all kinds of Martian 
goods. Especially carved ruby. But 
Earth people were so rich now that 
practically every household had 
some Martian ruby product in it, as 
well as Martian glassware. The 
sands of Mars were especially 
suited to glass making. 



Avo’s lodge was little used and 
poorly tended, not much different 
from dozens of spacer lodges spot- 
ted around the Sandyville enclave, 
just a thirty- foot house dome within 
a ninety-foot glass air dome. But it 
was his. 

Avo had yet to take wives, not 
uncommon among veteran spacers, 
who usually settled in to a planet- 
home around forty- five or so. Avo 
had known a beautiful Martian 
girl as a lover when he was on the 
Ring convoys, but she had died at 
an outpost weather station during a 



26 



GALAXY 



ferocious sandstorm, so many years 
ago. 

Pardee was an immediate success 
in the enclave’s social life. Real 
Earthmen were uncommon outside 
Marsport. His tales of hay fields 
and horses astounded the veterans 
and children alike. His thick frame 
and multiple tatoos fascinated the 
Martian women. It was clear that he 
could easily add as many more to 
his family as his Earth wife would 
accept. 

After five days of dune trekking 
he declared, “I'm going home for 
one last time, Avo. Pack up my 
family and go Martian. I knew I’d 
be doin' it someday. Since I was in 
astro-engineering school. My wife 
knows it, too. We can make it up 
here.” 

Avo nodded. “You can go inde- 
pendent here. I know a crater up 
north that’s half filled with ice. I 
can build a lodge there and an air 
maker, put up planthouses. I can, 
we can, get an independent mine 
contract, finance a platform . 
you can set up planethome 
here.” 

“1 can see it all,” said Pardee. 
“It could really work out. We can 
get finance down in Oklahoma and 
Texas in a hot second; that way we 
can open an Earth-Moon trade line. 
Long as we don’t sell out com- 
pletely, it will be our own trip to 
manage.” 

“No corporation bosses to tell us 
what to mine or where to mine,” 
Avo replied. “Only a tenth of the 



asteroid belt has been prospected. 
We can trade where we want. Van- 
dts or Crater or Moon. Just one 
year out. maybe two, and we’d pay 
off any investors real handsome.” 
“It’s done!” Pardee leaped up 
and looked out over the shifting 
miles of low dunes. “I’ll get us 
some investors that’ll make your 
head spin.” 



Avo returned to Marsport with 
Pardee on the weekend shuttle. Par- 
dee had enough pull to get a book- 
ing to Moon on the first ore freight- 
er. From Moon there was an every- 
day transit down to Earth. “Don’t 
let your ass rust away up here, 
now,” Pardee pointed a finger 
right at Avo. “You come on down 
to Earth as soon as you can book 
transit. We’re gonna do some busi- 
ness, partner.” 

“I’ll be down in maybe four 
months, five months. What I can do 
up here is find us a platform to rig 
out. Lots of the wildcatters are old 
now, need first class refitting. I can 
contract one from Crater, no sweat. 
Then we’ll have to lease a transpor- 
ter . Plans and ideas filled his 
mind. The prospect of starting new 
thrilled him with the same kind of 
excitement he had felt so long ago 
when he was standing on a five- 
mile long chunk of ice floating 
through the Rings above the mon- 
strous orb of Satum. 

The black shuttle screamed off 



AND EARTH SO FAR AWAY

the runway carrying Avo’s new 
partner away into space and to his 
rendezvous with the ore freighter 
which would cany him home. 

“Home is a place where, when 
you have to go there, they have to 
take you in,” Avo said, recounting 
the lines of an old Earth poet. 
“When I get down to Earth,” he 
thought, “I’ve got a place now; Ok- 
lahoma, wherever that is.” He 
made a note to check an Earth Atlas 
in the Corporation library back at 
Mars port. 

His return to the capital was less 
conspicuous this time. He caught 
the public van and rode in silence 
toward the shimmering cluster of 
domes. He had an interview that af- 
ternoon with the Chief of Mining 
Operations during which he had de- 
cided to make his resignation. 

The Corporation’s SpaceMining 
complex was a marvel in architec- 
ture with its own security dome set 
under the city’s massive community 
air dome. A small forest of conifers 
and mountain Earth shrubbery were 
landscaped into Martian boulders 
and massive ruby conglomerates. 
The buildings were soft pinkstone 
and stainless steel with blue Martian 
marble floors. Water, the ultimate 
luxury on this dry, dusty planet, 
spurted from a dozen fountains. He 
walked across the inner courtyard 
set with cool green grass and took 
the escalator to the CMO suite. His 
welcome seemed cool and somehow 
overly correct. 

The chief was an Earth man cn- 

28 



gineer. A grounder with limited 
space experience, he was a deft 
administrator and organizer. Avo 
didn’t get a chance to resign. 
“What’s been decided, Earthside, 
Avo, is to accelerate your pension 
date and give you a much needed 
rest. I want you to know it was not 
my decision, nothing unilateral 
about it. You know, with things in 
such a state of unrest, as far as 
Vandis and these renegade Russians 
down south, Earthside is overly 
concerned about security of the plat- 
forms. It’s not your own personal 
loyalty, just a lack of understand- 
ing. What they don’t want is a 
whole platform going over to Van- 
dis, leaving the Constitution juris- 
diction and precipitating legal ac- 
tion. 

Incidentally, I am empowered 
to give you this meritorious credit 
certificate for your part in the res- 
cue, which was entirely your show 
from my point of view. And fi- 
nally,” the Chief stood up from be- 
hind his desk and handed Avo a 
slender black box. “Go ahead,” the 
Chief beamed. “Open it.” Avo 
snapped open the lid and stared at a 
gold digital wrist watch. “Last you 
a lifetime,” the Chief claimed. 
“I’ve got one just like it. It’s just a 
token, Avo. Just a token. It gives 
Earthtime, Moontime and Marstime! 
Now if there’s anything I can do 
personally to aid your transi- 
tion . any references or such, 
don’t hesitate to write.” 

Avo stood up quietly. “Well, I 

GALAXY 



was hoping perhaps I could use the 
library here when I’m under the 
dome. For awhile anyhow.” 

“Certainly,” said the Chief. “I’ll 
have the security section issue you a 
pass. We have the best microlibe on 
Mars, you know.” Avo shook 
hands with the Chief. They both 
smiled and neither said anything.” 



A month later, he was watching 
the stars pop up, clear and frosty, 
over the rim of his crater. The great 
bank of snow and ice that partially 
filled the high northwest wall glis- 
tened in the shadow. He thought of 
the ice that had condensed around 
the floating housetank after the 
blowout, now a year gone by. 

He snapped open the face mask 
of his airpack and took a puff on a 
pipe stuffed with black lichen, then 
lay back on the red sand. Earth and 
Venus were bright against the 
blue-black sky. Venus was so much 
the brighter, so stark white and bril- 
liant she seemed much closer than 
Earth, which was twinkling blue 
and green. 

He imagined himself in a library 
somewhere down there in a city 
next to the sea. He imagined 
plump, longhaired Earthgirls swim- 
ming naked in the waves. He blew 
out the lichen smoke and flapped 
the face mask back in place. Earth 
glittered in the evening sky. He 
wondered if he was looking at Ok- 
lahoma. ★ 




AND EARTH SO FAR AWAY 



SPECIAL FEATURE 



Postscript to GATEWAY 



W hen i submitted the manu- 
script of Gateway to Jim Baen for 
Galaxy, I warned him fair and 
square, I did. I said there were 
some problems. I told him that, not 
only was it pretty complex to be 
broken into serial installments, and 
typographically a nightmare besides, 
but I was still tinkering with it. And 
so 1 was. I rewrote it completely 
after that first draft, particularly the 
ending. I don’t know how many 
times I revised that. What 1 do 
know is that after I was completely 
through with it (or thought I was) 
and had turned in a complete manu- 
script, 1 then had second thoughts 
and decided to omit the very last 
(and very short) chapter. 

Now that (he book is in print, 
comments and reviews have been 
coming in. I must say they have 
been extremely kind, by and large, 
but more than one of them has 
commented that the ending takes 
some getting used to. And now Jim 
has asked me to let him publish that 
omitted last chapter, and along with 



it to try to explain what was going 
on in my head. 

1 am going to try to do this. But 
because I embarrass easily, let me 
say something first. Producing a 
book is a lot like producing a baby. 
Everybody knows what has been 
going on, but it does seem very 
delicate to talk about it explicitly in 
public. So bear with me, please, 
dear friends, while 1 try to do this 
public flashing as gracefully as I 
can. 

Besides being a novel. Gateway 
is an attempt to try to do something 
I have wanted to do for a long time: 
to say everything I knew, about a 
world I had made up. 

All science fiction writers invent 
the worlds their characters move in, 
of course, and in the course of 
doing so most of us figure out more 
about them than we ever put on pa- 
per. If you ask Larry Niven about 
the kzinti, he can tell you details of 
their dreams and their breeding 
habits that have never been pub- 
lished. So can Gordon Dickson 



30 



GALAXY 



about the Dorsai. So can I about 
most of the characters and settings 
I’ve used. 

The reason that not all of this 
backgrounding gets into print is not 
because the authors want to keep 
secrets from the rest of the world, 
but because explaining too much 
slows down the action. Science 
fiction readers already accept much 
greater demands on their imagina- 
tion and intelligence than the read- 
ers of most fiction will sit still for. 
But there is a limit to even their pa- 
tience. Past a certain point, they 
don’t want to hear any more talk 
about why a thing is, they want to 
get on with it. 

Contrariwise, one of the Great 
Good Things about science fiction 
is just that it does build these in- 
teresting and colorful new worlds 
for us to roam around in in our im- 
aginations. I imagine most of us 
have fantasied from time to time 
about living on Barsoom or Os- 
nome, or in any world that some 
writer has given us a passport to. 

The experiment I wanted to try 
was to make that whole world as 
complete as I could. To say about it 
everything that I knew to say. Not 
just enough to account for why the 
characters behaved as they did. Not 
just the physical parameters, The 
habits, the clothing, the recreations, 
(he constraints, the sensory inputs. 
Much of that can be done in ordi- 
nary narrative, and here Robert A. 
Heinlein is probably the father of us 
all. Some can’t, not even by Hein- 



lein. And to get this in without re- 
quiring the characters to tell each 
other things endlessly I adopted the 
device of ‘‘sidebars.’’ I do not 
claim it for an invention; it is a 
technique of journalism. But I do 
not remember having seen it used in 
just that way in any novel. John 
Dos Passos had done something like 
it in 19 J9, a long time ago, by 
using newspaper reports, an innova- 
tion picked up and carried a step 
farther by John Brunner in Stand On 
Zanzibar, i had experimented with 
the concept, from a somewhat dif- 
ferent tack (only to provide bio- 
graphical detail about some of the 
characters) in a not very successful 
“mainstream” novel called Presi- 
dential Year, which 1 wrote with 
Cyril Kombluth in 1956. 

For Gateway, it looked like the 
device that would do what I wanted 
done. So for a year or more after 
the novel itself was essentially com- 
plete I found myself composing 
poems, classified ads, letters-to- 
the-editor, mission reports and all 
sorts of other data inputs to be in- 
serted into the work. I travel a lot. I 
almost always carry a portable 
typewriter with me (it is my se- 
curity typewriter, I am uneasy with- 
out it), and so I wrote little bits and 
pieces of sidebars in all sorts of 
places: in the TWA lounge at 
O’ Hare Airport, between sessions at 
any number of college lecture dates 
and sf cons, on trains, in a hotel 
room in Toronto in the intervals on 
a week-long commitment to CBC

Television in connection with the 
Apollo-Soyuz hookup. .every- 
where. 1 have a very clear memory 
of the expression on the face of the 
maid as she came into my stateroom 
on Cunard’s liner Adventurer, 
somewhere between islands in the 
Caribbean. 1 had laid out clumps 
and sheaves of pages on every flat 
surface in the room — beds, chairs, 
floor — trying to piece together my 
jigsaw puzzle. She wanted desper- 
ately to make my bed. But I 
couldn’t let her, because I was try- 
ing to make a novel. 

I don’t promise that this is the 
best way to write a novel. (If any- 
one ever finds out what the best 
way is I wish he'd tell me.) But in 
this case it had advantages. The 
world does not look the same from 
the deck of a ship, or from an all- 
night diner across the highway from 
a motel, as it does from my writing 
office, on the top floor of an old 
monster of a house in New Jersey. I 
think some of those differences in 
perspective must be reflected in the 
sidebars. 

At any rate, the time came when 
somehow I had patched all the 
pieces together and was into the 
final revision on this rather demand- 
ing chunk of my life. Then I dis- 
covered that Gateway had taken its 
future into its own hands. It wasn’t 
a single consecutive story anymore. 
It wasn’t even the two stories that 
ran concurrently, the analysis ses- 
sions threaded into the straight nar- 
rative of Broadhead’s life. It looked 



to me as though it were coming 
close to turning out to what I had 
wanted it to be: a world. 

Well, all right. But how do you 
end a world? A novel I usually can 
figure out how to end. In fact, I 
know a lot of ways. Usually there is 
one that fits. The choice of the right 
one depends on what is the main 
thrust of your story. At one time I 
had considered that the main thrust 
of Gateway was the color and terror 
of the black hole. (The working title 
of the book, in fact, was then 
Beyond the Blue Event Horizon.) 
At another I had thought it was 
the personal story of Robinette 
Broadhead. At stilt another, as the 
computer-psychoanalyst Sigfrid von 
Shrink seemed more and more im- 
portant, I thought maybe it was 
even his stoiy. For each of these I 
could see an ending; but all of them 
were wrong for Gateway as it had 
evolved. 

Well, you already know (if 
you’ve read the story that is) what 
decision 1 finally made. 

Is it right? 

God knows. It’s the Tightest I 
could make it. For better or worse, 
that’s where I stand. 

Nevertheless I think it rather as- 
tute of the reviewers and others to 
have noticed that there is something 
unusual about the ending. And for 
any readers who are interested 
enough to have stayed with me this 
long, here is the brief last chapter 
that 1 removed from the novel 
. .just for fun.

Chapter XXXII 



What is so rare as a day in 
June? A beautifully written, enter- 
taining book. Such a book is Fred 
Pohl's Gateway, a fascinating sci- 
ence fiction story and a highly 
crafted look at the nature of a 
man. .Robinette 
Broadhead, . .Pohl paces the 
novel masterfully, so that the reve- 
lation of the action coincides with 
Broadhead’ s personal revelation. 
The only possible weakness of the 
book lies in the speed at which the 
final events take place. It is not un- 
like waiting in tine for hours to see 
a work of art, and then being whip- 
ped past it without having an oppor- 
tunity to study it. That moment is an 
awesome one, something worth lin- 
gering over. But the very real 
necessities of the plot require 
otherwise, and the story is really 
about Broadhead, not that brief 
moment of scientific wonder." — 
Delap's F&SF Review.

The analyst is a computer named 
Sigfrid von Shrink , and the patient 
is the ulcer-ridden, fabulously weal- 
thy lone survivor of the most mon- 
strous disaster in the history of the

sort of ragged, irresistible bravura

splendid invention. Major Pohl, and

Under the bubble the late af- 
ternoon sun was warm and gentle. 
It was late, but I went right to the 
club: shower, plunge, ten minutes 
in the sauna; and when I came out I 
was ready for my date with S. Ya. I 
was more than ready. I was looking 
forward to it. Not only for S. Ya. 
herself, pretty, intelligent, kind as 
she was. I wanted very much to 
make love to her, but ( also wanted 
to talk to her. 

All that stuff Sigfrid was giving 
me — was it his crazy electronic fan- 
tasy? Or was it real? S. Ya. would 
know, or at least know enough to 
talk sensibly about the possibility of 
laying machine emotions onto 
machine intelligence. 

Oh, I had not forgotten Klara! 
She was still in my heart, as much 
as ever — more than ever, because 
underneath the pain and the guilt 
were the tenderness and the love, 
that I would have for always, 
wherever real-Klara was. 

I have all my parts hack again; I 
am whole and as well as any living 
thing is ever going to be. .which, 
I decide, is good enough for me. I 
have even got something I want to 
do! I owe Sigfrid a favor. He 
healed me. 

Maybe, with a little help from S.

A bit lower on the left. Bit 
more. There, that’s it. Hold i. right 
there.” 

( held it as Waldo directed and he 
drove in the last nail, then stepped 
back. Perfect. We looked at the 
sign and beamed at each other. 

‘Buimeister & Carver — Legal 
Advisors.’ The old firm, a long way 
from Washington D.C., but back in 
business again. 

We went into the office and 
closed the door. Not much space 
inside — it cost ten credits a square 
foot, unfurnished, for rentals in 
Th arsis City. But we had one 
respectable-sized office, and a much 
less fancy office/utility room behind 
it. We’d agreed to take turns man- 
ning the front office until we built 
up enough business to spread our- 
selves a bit. As the first and only 
lawyers on Mars, we were sure that 
wouldn’t take long. 

I went back to my desk in the 
rear office — Waldo was taking the 
first shift out front. Then I came 
straight out again. Fifteen minutes 
earlier there had been a jelly 
doughnut on my table. I looked at 
Waldo and began, “Waldo, did 
you — ?” 

What was the use? I gave up in 
mid-sentence. In the twenty years 
since we left law school I’d seen 
Waldo swell from a youth of sylph- 
like elegance to a first-order man- 
mountain. The time he'd spent 
(more accurately, done) on the 
Venus terra-forming project had 
thinned him, temporarily, but as 



soon as he reached Mars he’d 
started to swell again. I’d bullied, 
insulted, cajoled, lectured and 
warned Waldo. If he kept on eating 
the way he did, one day he’d 
explode. He listened contritely, 
swore he’d diet at once, implored 
me to keep sweet stuff out of his 
reach and thanked me for trying to 
help. Then as soon as my back was 
turned — chomp. 

As it turned out, we had been 
over-optimistic about the number of 
cases that would come our way. 
True, we were the only lawyers for 
forty million miles, and Mars did 
have a population of several 
thousand. But — no business. I main- 
tain that where a barbarian would 
pick up a rock or a tree root to set- 
tle a dispute, a civilized man picks 
up a videophone and seeks legal 
counsel. Measured by that standard, 
Mars was too busy scrabbling for 
survival to qualify above the barba- 
rian level. For the first three weeks 
I had little to do but sit about, 
watching Waldo occupy a steadily 
increasing amount of the available 
office space. 

When our first client finally ar- 
rived, Waldo was manning the front 
desk and I was sitting in the back 
office looking at a lunar travel 
brochure. Waldo collected them. I 
was reading a poetic description of 
a valley of mud, dust and rock 
when I heard the door of the outer 
office. 

“Are you Burmeister and 
Carver?” asked an unfamiliar voice. 



PERFECTLY SAFE, NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT 



35 



'We are. I am WaJdo Burmeis- 
ler, at your service.” 

"I'm Peter Pinion. I’ve got some- 
thing extremely valuable here and 
I’d like to leave it with you to lock 
in your safe.” 

Waldo’s visitor seemed to be 
confusing us with a bank. We 
didn’t have a safe, just a big cup- 
board in the back room with a de- 
fective lock. 1 sneaked a look 
through a narrow crack in the ill- 
fitting and badly made door be- 
tween our inner and outer offices. 
Our visitor was very tali and lanky, 
with brown hair and a pair of inno- 
cent and startlingly blue eyes. His 
dress told me that he was a 
ranger — probably a geologist, rov- 
ing around outside the domed city 
areas. Waldo had responded instinc- 
tively to the words ‘extremely valu- 
able’ and had Pinion already seated 
in our one comfortable chair. 

What would it be? Precious 
metals, old artifacts, Martian 
supcrfluids? I could almost hear the 
cash registers ringing in Waldo’s 
head. 

"In our safe, Mr. Pinion? Of 
course. Where is youY deposit?” 

Waldo hadn’t missed a beat. Pin- 
ton reached into his brown, bulky 
jacket and produced a small phial, 
about the size of a pill bottle, con- 
taining a pale, oily-looking liquid. 
Since Pinton couldn't see me t felt 
free to register my disappointment. 

Waldo looked at the bottle dubi- 
ously. “What exactly is it, Mr. Pin- 
ton?” 



“It’s Pintonite, that’s what it is.” 
Our visitor smiled happily. “It’s 
going to make me the richest man 
on Mars. I always suspected there 
should be something like this 
here — I’ve looked in places where 
the areology is right for ten years, 
and I’ve finally found and refined 
it." He held up the bottle. “The 
most powerful chemical explosive 
ever known, by a factor of ten. One 
gram’s enough to blow a ten-meter 
crater in solid rock. It’ll re- 
volutionize mining on the as- 
teroids.” 

Peter Pinton must have noticed 
Waldo’s lack of enthusiasm at the 
idea of looking after a super- bomb. 
“Perfectly safe, nothing to wony 
about,” he added. He shook the 
bottle with great vigor. 

I screamed so hard that no sound 
came out and clapped my hands 
over my ears. Waldo, with an 
equally sound protective logic, cov- 
ered his eyes with his hands. Pinton 
cackled inanely. “Perfectly safe. 
Only explodes under very special 
conditions. Safe as water." 

He reached into his jacket again 
and produced a five thousand credit 
note. “Here’s a down payment. I’ll 
need your help when the time 
comes to negotiate on this with 
General Mining." 

Now he was talking. I breathed 
again, but Waldo still seemed curi- 
ously reluctant to touch the phial or 
the money. I decided that it was 
time to introduce myself to our new 
client.

GALAXY 



I had second thoughts as I came 
into the room. Peter Pinton was 
offering the phial to Waido with his 
right hand and absent-mindedly 
scratching himself around the ribs 
with his left. No wonder Waldo was 
hesitant. I’ve read a hundred 
theories as to how Earth fleas 
evaded pre-flight inspection to get 
to Mars, and 1 don’t believe any of 
them. But when you’ve seen how 
far a flea can jump under a surface 
gravity only two- fifths that of Earth, 
and with an atmosphere in the 
domed cities only one -third as 
dense, you have no trouble under- 
standing how they’ve managed to 
spread the way they have. I could 
detect ripples of sympathetic itching 
running up and down Waldo’s back. 
As Peter Pinton and 1 shook hands 
and he gave me the money and 
phial, I watched him closely for 
emigrants. 

Pinton seemed relieved to be rid 
of the bottle. “I told Muriel I 
wanted somebody else to look after 
the Pintonite this morning. I'm not 
comfortable canying valuables in 
the domicibile. I feel a lot easier 
now. Weil, I’ll be off. See you in a 
few days. 1 want to hear what 
Muriel says when 1 tell her you're 
looking after the Pintonite.” 

“Your wife?” I asked politely. 

He looked at me curiously. 
“Now what would a maxi want with 
a woman, out in (he red ranges? 
Muriel’s my parrot.” And he was 
gone without further comment. 

Waldo took a big gulp of un- 



sweetened coffee absent-mindedly 
as Pinton left the room. His face 
puckered like a punctured Mars 
dome. For the past couple of days 
he’d been holding down on his 
calories and we’d thrown out every 
temptation. The change so far was 
imperceptible. 

I locked the money in our cash 
box and went through to the inner 
office to put Pinton ’s phial into the 
big cupboard, in among (he crock- 
ery, stationery, low-calorie food 
items and legal reference volumes. I 
put it on the bottom shelf, next to 
Waldo's weighing-machine. He’d 
bought a spring balance, and de- 
rived comfort from the thought that 
he weighed less than eighty 
kilos — his ‘college weight,’ as he 
described it. I wondered if he was 
looking at lunar brochures for his 
next stopping-point when his 
Mars-weight topped eighty. 

In the front office Waldo had a 
dreamy expression in his eyes. “If 
General Mining would pay Pinton a 
million credits for the rights to Pin- 
toniie, I bet that United Chemicals 
would offer double.” 

I nodded. We discussed it no fur- 
ther. As Disraeli remarked, sensible 
men are all of (he same religion. 
And pray, what is that? Sensible 
men never tell. Substitute ’financial 
views' for ‘religion’ there, and you 
have my altitude exactly. 

The next time Peter Pinton 
showed up at the office I was on 
my own. Waldo had gone off for a 
meeting ‘with an industrial group’ 



PERFECTLY SAFE, NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT 



37 



and I had not asked for details. Pin- 
ton sat down with the neat move- 
ments of a man who spent most of 
his life inside a three by four meter 
domicibile — the standard house/ 
mobile lab/explorer vehicle of the 
Mars rangers. He took a small jar 
of white crystals from his jacket 
pocket and placed it on the table. 

“Version two,” he said. 
“Purified, ten times as powerful per 
gram. Take this for your safe and 
give me the other one back — I need 
it for a little demonstration later this 
week.” 

I hesitated and he misunderstood 
my reluctance. “Oh, it's as safe as 
the last lot. Under any normal cir- 
cumstances, perfectly neutral. See 
here.” He unscrewed the top of the 
jar, licked his finger lip, dipped it 
in the white powder and stuck it in 
his mouth. He grinned happily as 1 
goggled. 

“Perfectly safe. Want a lick? It 
doesn’t taste of much,” he assured 
me. “Sort of yeasty and a bit 
sweet.” 

I declined the offer and went re- 
luctantly through to the inner office. 
I closed the door — so P inton 
wouldn't see the non-existent 
safe — and opened the cupboard to 
get the phial. Would it still be 
there? Thank heaven, it was, just 
where 1 had left it. Perhaps I had 
misjudged Waldo’s meeting. Feel- 
ing much happier I placed the jar of 
crystal Pintonite in the cupboard 
and gave his phial back to Pinton. I 
sat down again behind the desk. 



Pinton seemed in no hurry and in a 
chatty mood, and I wanted certain 
information from him. 

“Occurs naturally on Mars?" he 
said, repeating my question. “Yes, 
in erode form. Now that’s not 
surprising — Mars has a different 
geological history from Earth, so 
we expect some different com- 
pounds. Pintonite’s an isomeric 
hydrocarbon -fluorocarbon form — 

just as diamond is a form of carbon, 
created under special conditions in 
the history of the planet.” 

“You mean you could make Pin- 
tonite from other things, the way 
we make diamonds?” 

“Sure — if you knew the chemical 
structure and were smart enough, 
you could synthesize it. But why 
bother? There’s plenty here on Mars 
if you’re smart enough to know 
where to look and what to look 
for.” He preened himself. “You 
see, the thing that makes Pintonite 
so powerful is just an unusual hy- 
drocarbon bond. It’s like a compres- 
sed spring, with a catch on it. Un- 
hook the catch, and all that energy 
in the spring is released. The se- 
cret’s in the chemical structure.” 

“And that can be found by mea- 
surement?” 

“Sure. Any run-of-the-mill lab 
could do it. That’s why I wanted to 
have it here, where it’s safe, and 
not where the industrial espionage 
boys could lay their hands on it.” 

His simple trust in the legal pro- 
fession was touching. My suspi- 
cions that he was a little cracked 



38 



GALAXY 



were growing. As he left, those 
suspicions were given a strong 
boost by our neighbor along the 
corridor. She was a youngish, talka- 
tive mother of three, with a husband 
who worked the day shift outside 
the domes in the open-field agricul- 
tural area. According to Waldo, she 
fancied me — by comparison, I 
suppose — but I had so far survived 
with my honor intact. 

As Peter Pinton departed she 
came along the corridor and looked 
into the office. Her hair had so 
many curlers in it that she seemed 
to be wearing an elaborate bronze 
headpiece. 

“What’s old Pete been doing in 
here?” she inquired. “I haven’t 
seen him for a year or two." 

“Legal matters, Mrs. Wilkin- 
son — I can’t betray a client’s confi- 
dences, you know. Where did you 
meet Mr. Pinton?” 

“Oh, me and him had a thing 
going for a while. Never got too 
serious, though. He was always too 
busy during the day — not like you 
lawyers.” She paused and eyed me 
speculatively for a few moments. 
Gambit declined, she went on. 
“Anyway, I got a bit tired of him 
after a while. He was always going 
on about his bloody parrot. No 
wonder they all called him Looney 
Pete.” 

She turned her head back along 
Ihe corridor, revealing the full 
splendor of her ormolu helmet, and 
shouted a snappy reply to a child’s 
question. Then she smiled at me al- 



luringly. “I’m just going to have a 
cup of coffee and a little something 
to go with it, Mr. Carver. Perhaps 
you’d like to join me?" 

As she raised her plucked eye- 
brows inquiringly, Waldo’s familiar 
figure loomed over her shoulder. I 
looked at him with relief. She gave 
him a savage glare and (hen disap- 
peared down the corridor. Waldo 
was in excellent spirits. I wondered 
just what he’d been up to. Well, re- 
gardless of that I had work of my 
own to do now, as soon as I could 
find the right place to help me. But 
I must admit that I didn’t feel com- 
forted by our lady neighbor’s report 
on our client, Mr. Peter Pinton. 



Neither Waldo nor I were particu- 
larly alarmed at first when the Thar- 
sis City police arrived. Our licenses 
were in good shape, and our creden- 
tials to practice law on Mars im- 
peccable. As the only two lawyers 
on the planet, we had framed the 
bar charter ourselves. 

Police Investigator Lestrade had 
with him a saturnine, dark-haired 
man from General Mining, a double 
for Bela Lugosi in the classic 
Dracula 2-D movies, whom he in- 
troduced to us as Test Supervisor 
Kozak. 

Like most Martians, they seemed 
puzzled by what Waldo and I actu- 
ally did for a living. We explained 
our activities and they dutifully re- 
corded (hem with a slight air of dis- 



PERFECTLY SAFE, NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT 



39 



belief. After the general introduc- 
tions Lestrade cleared his throat, 
scratched his thinning pate, and got 
down to business. 

“Yesterday, Mr. Peter Pinton 
gave a demonstration of a powerful 
new explosive to General Mining. 
Mr. Kozak supervised the test.” 
Lestrade spoke very slowly, picking 
his words with care. “Now, we 
would like you to tell us all that 
you know about that explosive, Pin- 
tonite.” 

He stopped. We waited. No more 
words came, apparently he was 
done. 1 was puzzled by his accusing 
manner and wondered again if 
Waldo had been up to something. 

“I think there may be a misun- 
derstanding,” I finally replied. 
“We know very little. We’re not 
geologists or chemists, you know. 
You want to talk to Peter Pinton 
himself — he’s the expert.” 

“You can ask him,” said Les- 
trade morosely. He placed a silver 
box on the desk, about the same 
size and shape as a portable com- 
municator. 1 looked at it for the 
send/receive button but couldn’t see 
it. I looked questioningly at Les- 
trade, who pressed a catch on the 
side of the box. The top opened to 
reveal a layer of grey powder in- 
side. 

“There’s Peter Pinton, all there is 
of him.” Lestrade looked at the box 
with a certain macabre satisfaction. 
“When he brought in his explosive, 
with his claim that it was super- 
powerful and completely safe, Mr. 



Kozak insisted on a controlled de- 
monstration. They put Pinton inside 
a sealed metal tank to set up the test 
and watched from outside. Pinton 
was half right, you might say — it’s 
far and away the most powerful 
explosive anybody has ever seen. 
But Pinton hadn’t told anybody the 
chemical formula for it. Mr. Kozak 
came to see us after the explosion 
yesterday afternoon, and this morn- 
ing we went over to see Polly — ” 

“ — his parrot,” Waldo inter- 
jected, nodding intelligently. 

“ — Polly Pinton, his ex-wife, 
now living in Chryse Dome,” Les- 
trade went on. 1 He scrutinized 
Waldo closely, as though mentally 
measuring him for a straitjacket. 
“She told us that Pinton had left a 
sample of the explosive with Henry 
Carver and Waldo Burmeister, 
Lawyers, at this address.” 

I sighed. So much for a deal with 
United Chemicals. I looked at 
Waldo. He shrugged and went into 
the back room to get the Pintonite 
sample. 

After half a minute of banging 
around in the cupboard he was 
back, pale and sweating. 

“Henry, it’s not there.” He sig- 
nalled his next message with his 
eyes, as clearly as if he had spoken 
it: “What have you done with it, 
Henry?” 

1 was shocked. “It must be there, 
Waldo, I saw it just yesterday. Let 
me take a look. ” 

1 went into the back room and 
did a lightning but thorough search 



40 



GALAXY 



of the cupboard. No jar of white 
crystals, not a sign of it. 

“Henry, for God’s sake, don’t 
play games,” whispered Waldo 
from just behind me. “Tell them 
what you did with it, we can’t do 
any deals now.” 

I turned back to him. “What do 
you mean, play games? Aren’t you 
the one who took it to United 
Chemicals?” 

He shook his head. “1 was sup- 
posed to meet them again tomor- 
row, with a sample.” 

We looked at each other in dis- 
may and stupefaction. Finally we 
went back into the outer office and 
faced Lestrade. He took the news 
that the Pintonite was gone with no 
emotion. It seemed almost as 
though he had expected something 
like that. He nodded slowly. 

“We’ll have to do a deep probe 
to get information on this. Who was 
here when Peter Pinton brought that 
explosive in and discussed storing it 
with you?” 

"I was,” Waldo reluctantly vol- 
unteered. 

"And were you present, Mr. 
Carver?” asked Lestrade. 

"Only at the very end of the 
meeting.” Thank heaven for literal 
troth, and for the legal definition of 
present. 

"Right. Mr. Burmeister, you’ll 
have to come with us. This exami- 
nation will take a few hours.” 

The game was over all right. But 
thank heaven, too, for my own 
foresight. I took out my wallet with 



a sigh and removed a slip of paper 
from it. 

"I don’t think that will be neces- 
sary, Mr. Lestrade. This contains 
the chemical analysis of a Pintonite 
sample, performed just a few days 
ago.” 

I handed it to him. Waldo looked 
like a man reprieved at the eleventh 
hour — psychoprobes were tough 
stuff and a few people came out of 
them with their brains permanently 
scrambled. Kozak leapt on the 
paper with a cry of joy and read it 
while we watched. 

After a few seconds of inspection 
he began to turn into a vampire. His 
teeth curled back from his upper lip 
and a deep snarl came from him. 
He seemed all set to leap and suck 
blood. 

"Mr. Carver,” he finally said in 
choked tones. “You had a chemical 
analysis done. I suppose you are 
willing to tell us what type of 
analysis was performed?” 

Now I was really confused. 
“Well, of course I am. I asked 
them to do the most final and com- 
plete one that they could. I forget 
the exact word that was used on the 
order.’’ 

“An ultimate analysis?” 

“Yes, that’s it exactly.” 

“You scientific illiterate,” he 
screamed at once. “You great ba- 
boon.” My information didn’t seem 
to have pleased him. “An ultimate 
chemical analysis gives the final 
chemical composition in terms of 
the percentage of each element. It 



PERFECTLY SAFE, NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT 



■41 



doesn't tell you a thing about the 
chemical structure." He waved the 
paper in the air, literally gnashing 
his teeth as he did so. I'd never en- 
countered that before outside the 
holodramas. “This just gives the 
amount of carbon, hydrogen, oxy- 
gen and fluorine. 1 could no more 
make Pintonite from this informa- 
tion than 1 could make your friend 
here — ” He glowered at Waldo. 
“ — from a barrel of lard and a sack 
of flour.’’ 

An unfortunate example, I felt, 
and quite uncalled for. They drag- 
ged poor Waldo away to his fate. I 
hoped he'd be back again, intact, in 
a few hours. What on Earth — what 
on Mars — had gone wrong? I was 
sure Waldo had told me the truth — 
so where was the Pintonite? 

I wandered around the office, 
looking everywhere I could think of 
for the missing jar. No sign. 1 
picked up the useless chemical 
analysis paper — my trump card — 
and looked at it sadly. Then 1 
crumpled it into a ball and went 
through to the inner office to throw 
it into the trash. 

I opened the lid of the trash 
can — and froze. Suddenly, 1 under- 
stood exactly what had happened to 
the Pintonite. It had never occuned 
to me to tell Waldo that Peter Pin- 
ton had switched the phial of liquid 
for a jar of crystalline Pintonite. 
Waldo had been looking for the 
phial, while I’d looked for the jar. 
Now I’d found it. Empty. Waldo, 
in his insane lust for sweetmeats, 



had used three ounces of Pintonite 
to sugar his coffee. “Yeasty and 
sweet," Pinton had said. 

When events call for it I can be a 
man of action. In less than ten min- 
utes I had made reservations for 
Waldo and myself, immediate de- 
parture for Deimos. It was time that 
Burmeister and Carver found new 
business offices. I’d write and tell 
the Tharsis City police all about re- 
cent events, but I’d much rather do 
it from off-planet. I had a clear 
mental picture of three ounces of 
Pintonite going into and through 
Waldo. Tharsis City had, as I re- 
called, more than thirty thousand 
meters of sewage pipes beneath it. I 
could visualize a thin layer of Pin- 
tonite spread through every bit. 
Peter Pinton had said that it was 
perfectly safe, but his reputation as 
a reliable authority had diminished 
considerably in the past few hours. 
If the Tharsis City plumbing ar- 
rangements happened to have the 
right environment to set it off, it 
might not be the biggest explosion 
in the history of Mars, but it would 
certainly be the most disgusting. 

I sat down to wait impatiently 
for Waldo’s return. On second 
thoughts, I called and modified our 
space travel reservations. I didn’t 
know how long it took Pintonite to 
pass completely through the human 
alimentary canal. Separate flights. If 
Waldo was about to fulfill my old 
warning and finally, literally, 
explode, I would rather not partici- 
pate in the event. ★

A Time For Decisions 



Jerry ftHuneUe.PhP 




WE INTERRUPT THIS PROGRAM 



“W E SHALL NOBLY SAVE Or 
meanly lose ihe last best hope of 
Earth.” 

Lincoln was talking about an en- 
tirely different conflict when he said 
that, but it is a statement that 
applies to this generation in a way 
that was never true of Lincoln’s. No 
one today seriously believes that 
human chattel slavery would have 
survived into the present era no 
matter what the Union did in 1860; 
but I do seriously believe that a 
generation a hundred years from 
now might well curse our memory. 

It was the general concensus of 
the science press corps that this 
year’s annual meeting of the Ameri- 
can Association for the Advance- 
ment of Science (AAAS) was the 
least exciting of those we have re- 
cently attended. I agreed at the 
time. I don’t now. 

In the first place, while most of 
them had been reported earlier, 
44 



there were marvels enough: the 
Homestake Mine experiments that 
show there’s something wrong with 
the Sun; VIKING, two whole days 
worth, and all fascinating if non- 
conclusive; new particles for the 
basic physicists to play with. Any 
of those would be worth headlines. 
You can’t say 1976 was really dull. 

Secondly, under the non-spec- 
tacular headings, there was plenty of 
food for deep thought; and there 
was one announcement that ought 
to stir your blood. 

We can have on-line fusion 
power by 1993. You could be run- 
ning your car, or heating your wa- 
ter, or shaving your anatomy with 
power produced by deuterium- 
tritium fiision, seven years before 
this century ends. That's a good 
twenty years earlier than we ex- 
pected it; it’s in time to help get us 
through those critical thirty years 
I’ve spoken of in previous columns. 

GALAXY 



It’s in time to save the world. 

So why will our children curse 
our memory? 

The fusion people came to AAAS 
quietly ready to spring their bomb- 
shell: to say that, given some breaks, 
they'd have a reactor design by 
1990 or so, and eight years after 
(hat we could have on-line power. 
Then, when the inevitable question 
was asked about the earliest possi- 
ble date, they would spring 1985 as 
a target date for having a workable 
reactor design, given (1) lotsa 
money, and (2) a few bits of rather 
probable luck. They were, justifi- 
ably, prepared to do a bit of preen- 
ing. They didn’t have any spectacu- 
lar breakthroughs to announce, but 
they could stack up the evidence 
from dozens of laboratories and 
hundreds of experiments and come 
to the sudden realization that they 
really think they know how to 
achieve fusion — and, like the Man- 
hattan Project, to bring it off in 
more than one way at about the 
same time. 

Unfortunately the people who 
were ready to make that announce- 
ment weren’t at the AAAS meeting. 
They were back in Washington. 
You see. President Carter’s budget 
had just come out: and cut from it 
were $80 million in fusion research. 
Instead of quietly preening about 
accomplishments, the directors of 
the labs at Los Alamos, Princeton, 
Livermore, Sandia, were suddenly 
confronted with the need to phase 
out, stretch out, and probably to lay 



off staff. That $80 million was cut 
from the Ford budget which they 
thought was already $50 million too 
low. 

Instead of quiet pride, we had 
gloom and despair. “This country 
has no national commitment to fu- 
sion power,” saith one. “At the 
level of funding indicated by the 
new budget, we will stay with re- 
search forever; we will never have a 
reactor,” says another. “We’ll have 
to lay off people who have devoted 
their professional lives to fusion re- 
search” says a third. All unfortu- 
nately true. So the top people were 
back in Washington, pleading with 
Carter’s budgeters, and trying to 
slip the word to Congress that this 
wasn’t trimming fat, it wasn’t even 
slicing muscle; it was amputation of 
bone and sinew. As I write this 
there’s vague hope that Congress 
will restore at least part of those 
cuts; but it doesn't look as if they’ll 
succeed. 

Understand: a few years ago I 
wasn’t at all enthusiastic about 
shovelling money in the general di- 
rection of fusion research. Back in 
1970 if you asked the fusion people 
what they’d do if you doubled their 
budget, they’d stammer a bit, and 
eventually say they’d do more of 
what they were doing: build two re- 
search facilities, hire more people 
. Hardly confidence-inspiring. 

But that’s all changed. Now they 
can tell you exactly what they want, 
what pieces of hardware they need, 
what experiments must be per-

formed and how much they’ll cost. 
They’ve got a handle on the prob- 
lem. For example: in magnetic con- 
finement the critical figure of merit 
is the product of time and density 
and temperature. Two years ago 
they were at perhaps one percent of 
the figure needed. Now they’re at 
half. One more push and they reach 
scientific breakeven; that is, the 
reaction will produce more energy 
than was put in. 

Since any useful system will be 
far less than 100% efficient, that's 
still a long way from practical 
power. But once scientific break- 
even is achieved the rest is 
engineering — and it’s the engineer- 
ing that has been cut. Carter's 
budget funds level-of-effort re- 
search, and has nothing for new 
equipment, expansion, new pro- 
grams, etc. 

Unfortunately, that’s not all my 
gloomy news. 

The Shuttle: Carter’s stretch-out 
and delay of the first Shuttle flight 
stands as I write this. Meanwhile, 
out on the Mojave, the tethered 
flights of the Shuttle (Cartoon: Shut- 
tle mounted on back of 747. Cap- 
tion: “Not tonight, dear, 1 have a 
headache.”) have been so success- 
ful that a final one has been can- 
celled as not needed. She handles 
like a dream, the pilots tell us. 
About the time you read this they’ll 
drop the Enterprise free of the 747 
and let her glide in to a landing at 
Edwards. Technically the Shuttle 
program is ahead of schedule. Fi- 



nancially it couldn’t matter less. 



Fusion and space. Cheap, reliable 
energy, and access to eight new 
planets, thirty -four moons, and a 
million asteroids. Power and raw 
materials. We have it in our power 
to give those to our children. Possi- 
bly to enjoy their benefits within 
our own lifetimes, but certainly to 
give them to our children; and as 
I’ve said repeatedly in previous col- 
umns ("Survival with Style,” 
“Blueprint for Survival,” “That 
Buck Rogers Stuff”) once we have 
plenty of energy and easy access to 
space, the problems of mankind are 
solved. Well, not really: I don’t pre- 
tend there won’t be problems; I 
write about them in my stories. But 
the fear of starvation, environmental 
pollution, mass poverty — will be- 
come a memory. And that, I say, is 
worth handing on. 

I’ve given one picture of the fu- 
ture in previous columns. For 
another, let’s look at something else 
that happened at the AAAS meet- 
ing. 

The bible of the Appropriate 
Technology movement is E. F. 
Schumacher’s Small Is Beautiful: 
Economics as if People Mattered. I 
confess I haven’t read it. I have at- 
tempted to, several times, but each 
time I come across some outrageous 
statement such as “Statistics never 
prove anything” (page 20), my 
stomach hurts. Still, I am hardly 



46 



GALAXY 



against his concepts as I thought I 
understood them. As Joe Coates 
(Office of Technology Assessment) 
said, “Who can be in favor of in- 
appropriate technology?” 

The AP movement had a number 
of events at the A A AS meeting, and 
I attended them on the theory that I 
would get a painless introduction 
into what they were doing, that I 
would hear some numbers, get 
some reports, learn some appro- 
priate technology — and be able to 
pass it all on to my readers. After 
all, I’m interested in saving energy, 
and Larry Niven has turned off the 
heaters in his swimming pool until 
we can design and build a solar 
heater for it; I’ve experimented with 
hydroponic gardening, and I know 
my readers would tike to hear about 
practical ways to employ “appro- 
priate technology” in their lives. 

I got none of that. The first pre- 
sentation consisted of an intermina- 
ble series of slides (most out of 
focus) showing ugliness presented 
as if it were beauty. For some rea- 
son photographs of privies domi- 
nated the series: not only those 
$3000 Swedish gizmos that more or 
less automatically compost the stuff 
right in your home (provided you 
don’t have too large a family) but 
also good old-fashioned ODT’s of 
the kind my wife and I experienced 
in our childhood. The kind with the 
crescent cut in the door and a Sears 
catalogue handy in case you run out 
of Corncobs. “You only have to 
fork the stuff over about every two 




weeks,” we were told. “Of course 
you can run into problems with city 
departments of public health, so 
most of these are in rural areas.” 
My reaction was that I hoped to 
God the city Department of Health 
would give any of my neighbors 
who installed an ODT not merely 
problems, but citations. 

There were wine vats converted 
into bathtubs. We were solemnly 
told that this was a Good Thing be- 
cause it recycled and saved energy 
and like that. Most of the audience, 
predominately middle -class youth, 
sat enraptured as if in church. I 
wonder if they, at my age, would 
care for the splinters? And dammit, 
wine barrels are not appropriate as 
bathtubs. They aren't comfortable, 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



. 47 



nor are they very well designed. 

Another speaker told of how 
Appropriate Technology changes 
your head. When the wind comes 
up at 2 am and the batteries are all 
charged up, and you’ve got work to 
do, why, you get up and do it. 
Don’t waste that wind energy, be- 
cause the windmill can’t really 
power things at your convenience, 
so you must adapt yourself to the 
convenience of the earth. 

There was more. A lot more, and 
all in the same vein. Appropriate 
Technology, it seems, is not for the 
developing nations alone (if at all); 
it’s for us. So just what is it? Ac- 
cording to the Fact Sheet prepared 
by the National Center for Appro- 
priate Technology, the charac- 
teristics are these: “(1) small scale, 
(2) decentralized, (3) simple to un- 
derstand and operate, (4) ecologi- 
cally sound, and (3) labor inten- 
sive.” Now who can be against 
that? 

Well, to begin with, I don't know 
what “ecologically sound” means. 
I have heard people say that any 
permanent change in the ecology is 
evil; does that include Kansas wheat 
and Japanese rice, neither of which 
is “natural”? But leave that, and 
pass to point five, “labor inten- 
sive.” That is not merely a neces- 
sary evil. It is the heart of the AP 
movement. Given the choice they’ll 
take hard labor over machinery 
every time. 1 call to evidence one of 
their displays: a bicycle seat with 
pedals attached to a chain that ran 



a — wheat grinder. You can sit and 
knead bread with the hands while 
pumping away on the bicycle to 
grind the wheat with your own 
muscle power. In case you missed 
the point, there was a film strip 
showing how the bicycle seat sys- 
tem could be attached to small 
plows, dragging (hem through the 
dirt; to pump water; etc., etc. 

Now as an advance over the mor- 
tar and pestle, a leg-powered crank 
system is great; but blind donkeys 
walking circles to tum the upper on 
the nether millstone would be a hell 
of a lot less dull (for us; no one 
consults the donkey). In fact, on see- 
ing that particular vision of the 
future — and make no mistake about 
it, these people mean that to be the 
future — Larry Niven had a sugges- 
tion. I should, he said, put on 
jackboots and revolver, and carry a 
whip; we would then find a gentle- 
man of the black persuasion and 
dress him in rags and have him sit 
on the bicycle seat to grind our 
bread. It should, Lany mused, 
make a good photograph. A picture 
of the future. 

I can’t quarrel, except for details. 
The person seated on the bicycle 
seat might not be black, and might 
not be male; the person with whip 
might not be white or male; but if 
grinding one's com to make one’s 
bread requires that kind of labor, 
then slavery is not far away. “In 
the sweat of thy face shall thou eat 
bread”; And mankind has been try- 
ing to get someone else to do (he 



48 



GALAXY 



sweating ever since, and rather suc- 
cessfully at that. As a lark, as 
something chic, labor-intensive 
technology is all very well; but as a 
necessity it gets regular : it is not 
amusing as a way of life. 



All right: we’ve had our laugh at 
some silly people, extremists with a 
sprinkling of opportunists. Now 
let's get serious. Surely, Poumelle, 
you can’t be against conservation? 
Surely the AP movement, shorn of 
the more ridiculous aspects (and any 
view of life, carried to the extreme, 
can be made to look ridiculous) has 
great merit? Surely the idea is 
sound? 

I used to think so. I’m not sure I 
do any longer. The more I listen to 
the proponents of AP, the more I 
understand what they're saying, (he 
more 1 disagree. Look: why 

shouldn’t we have heated swimming 
pools? What’s wrong with big, 
comfortable, fast automobiles? Why 
is it evil to have throwaway 
flashlights, electric can openers, 
warm houses in winter, air condi- 
tioning, luxury foods, electric 
typewriters , plastic models, Fiber- 
glas yachts with Dacron sails, pock- 
et computers, my own postal scale 
here in my office so l don’t have 
to go down to the Post Office 
before mailing this manuscript — all 
the myriad conveniences, yea, 
luxuries, of this marvelous modem 
civilization? 



They pollute. They cause long- 
term harm to Mother Earth. Well, 
let’s fix that. Give me sufficient 
energy — and I know how to get 
that — and they won’t have any 
harmful long-term effects. 

They use up irreplaceable re- 
sources. Well, give me sufficient 
energy and I’ll recycle most of 
(hose. Give me access to space and 
I’ll bring you more resources than 
ever you dreamed of. And don’t 
think I can’t do that. 

They use up resources that should 
go to the world’s poor. Well, give 
me sufficient energy and access to 
space and I’ll make the whole world 
rich — and still have plenty left over 
for what I want. 

At this point the debate ceases. 
The usual parting remark is, “I 
wouldn’t expect you to under- 
stand.” In other words, at bottom 
the real enthusiasts of ‘‘Appro- 
priate” Technology are motivated 
by religion: by the work ethic; by 
that remnant theme of Western (and 
Eastern) philosophy that says “Life 
should be hard.” In the sweat of 
thy face shall thou eat bread. Pride 
goeth before a fall. Doom and 
catastrophe await the complacent. 
Etc. 

Well, maybe; but I will counter 
them with the Parable of the Ta- 
lents. Meanwhile, what’s wrong 
with the AP movement is that it 
docs not merely encourage the use 
of small-scale, personally con- 
structed improvements to one’s 
life — something we can all agree is 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



49 



a Good Thing — but it discourages 
any large-scale systematic solutions 
to the truly overwhelming problems 
facing our world. AP says we can 
get out of our box through putting 
beer cans on our roofs, building 
windmills and privies, turning wine 
vats into bathtubs, expecting less, 
making do with less; and that sim- 
ply ain't so, nor is it particularly 
desirable. 

In my last column I talked about 
use of waste resources. Does any- 
one seriously imagine that will 
come about through everyone's in- 
dividual efforts? That privies will 
do the job? Just how appropriate is 
Appropriate Technology? Would the 
world really be better off if, instead 
of trying to keep up with the litera- 
ture, and writing, I were to fork my 
own manure, grow my own vegeta- 
bles, engage in labor-intensive ac- 
tivities? 

Understand. I’ve nothing against 
developing ways that let everyone 
contribute to our social order, and 
I’ve no illusions about one unfortu- 
nate side-effect of our technological 
era: that it makes more and more 
people helpless, unable to find 
meaningful work, makes them feel 
useless; to the extent that the AP 
movement alleviates that, splendid. 
But I do point out that many of our 
large-city problems could be much 
reduced if people would make such 
minimum contributions as picking 
up trash where they find it, putting 
the lids on garbage cans, not litter- 
ing, and the like — none of which 



take the sustained and dreary effort 
required to grind one’s own wheat 
and bake one's own bread. 



Two pictures of the future: the 
bicycle-pedal wheat grinder with 
lowered thermostat, or unlimited 
energy and nearly boundless wealth. 
Let’s leave the dreary picture and 
look at the other one. 

There was at the AAAS meeting 
a symposium on the future of the 
hand calculator. The predicted de- 
velopments weren't startling, and 
won’t be to anyone who’s read The 
Mote In God's Eye ; but the time- 
scale and prices were. 

The limiting factor in costs of 
hand-held computers is (he hard- 
ware, such as keys and displays. 
The limiting factor in size is simi- 
larly the input-output mechanism. 
The could already put the most 
complex pocket calculator into your 
watch if there were any reason to 
do so — and if we could micto- 
miniaturize our eyes and fingers so 
that we could use the fool thing. 
Within five years the most elaborate 
calculators presently on the market 
will sell for fifty bucks or less. 

Within about the same time span 
they’ll be able to put the Rubber 
Handbook (The CRC Handbook of 
Chemistry and Physics, twelve 
pounds of tiny print) into a memory 
unit connectable to a pocket cal- 
culator and itself pocket-sized. In 
not a lot more time they could put 



50 



GALAXY 



the full capabilities of one of those 
Altair micro-computers into a 
hand-held calculator. If there was a 
market for a million units, the cost 
would be under fifty dollars. They 
could already build the best of the 
micro-computers into a box no 
larger than its keyboard and read-out 
screen. 

One reason all this hasn’t hap- 
pened is market potential: how 
many people want or need a full- 
capability programmable general- 
purpose computer? All of us. I’d 
say; but it requires some changes in 
our educational philosophy. For 
example: what is the value of know- 
ing the times table? Why should we 
be able to add up large columns of 
numbers? Well, you might one day 
be without your calculator. Self- 
reliance. It's good for the soul. 
Dammit, if we let the kids use cal- 
culators in school from first grade 
up, they’ll never understand 
numbers . 

As if most of them do now. I put 
it to you that the ones who now 
leam what numbers are ail about 
will leam it anyway; and those who 
never do learn can at least be taught 
how to use a pocket calculator, thus 
letting them have the opportunity to 
be waitresses, store clerks, taxi 
drivers, etc. When was the last time 
a Galaxy reader used a log table? 
Took a square root by pencil and 
paper? Multiplied three-digit 
numbers on paper? Added up a 
large column of figures? Certainly I 
do more calculations now than ever 



MOVING? 

Not very surprisingly, if you 
are a Galaxy subscriber 
chances are you tend to move 
around a lot; seeing new 
places, doing new things, living 
in new homes. This is just fine, 
of course, but from the rather 
specialized point of view of our 
Subscription Department it does 
present a problem. 

You see, while computers are 
fast and accurate, they are not, 
even ours, very bright. So when 
you inform them of a change of 
address, you should do it in a 
special way. Like this; 

NAME 

STREET ADDRESS 

CITY STATE ZIP 

and you should include an ac- 
tual Galaxy subscription 
address-tabel from your old ad- 
dress. Otherwise the computer 
might not understand, and that 
might mean that your next issue 
of Galaxy doesn’t reach you as 
quickly as it should: a terrible 
state of affairs, indeed! 

So, if you’re moving, please 
send a change-of-address card, 
made out as shown above, to- 
gether with an old subscription 
label, to:

I would if I had to go back to slide 
rules; and my work is the better for 
it. So is yours. Yet we are made to 
feel guilty because . , because 
what? Because making things easier 
is decadent? Nonsense. 

Beyond the pocket calculator is 
the implanted computer: the box 
that you think at, giving you instant 
access to the answer to any question 
you can think of (provided that the 
answer is known and stored, or cal- 
culable). How long to that? Larry 
and 1 ran into Dr. Adam Reed in 
the halls, and we had a pleasant 
chat. Reed is, you may recall, the 
engineer/psychologist at Rockefeller 
University who's working on 
brain-computer interfaces. 

He still puts preliminary results at 
about ten years' distance. He also 
reports new physiological evidence 
for the holographic model of the 
brain. (For more details on that 
theory, see my previous column, 
"Here Come the Brains,” October, 
1974 Galaxy.) Coupled with the 
truly remarkable advances in micro- 
miniaturization achieved by Texas 
Instruments, Hewlett-Packard, and 
other micro-chip manufacturers, the 
computer-in -your-head may well 
come within my lifetime, almost 
certainly within yours. 



So what else is new? Well, 
there's particle physics. Sub-nuclear 
physics is in a rather confused state 
at the moment, what with quarks. 



flavors, colors, “gluons" (yes, I 
said that; a postulated particle that 
“glues" certain quarks together) 
and every few months somebody 
finds a new anomaly that won’t fit 
what physicists think they know. 
But there’s some hope now: Chen 
Ning Yang, Albert Einstein Profes- 
sor of Physics at the State Univer- 
sity of New York, Sunny Brook, 
confidently expects to have a 
unified field theory within his 
lifetime — if someone doesn’t beat 
him to it. 

The reason is simple: physicists 
now have some new equipment to 
play with. The big Fermi ac- 
celerator at Batavia, Illinois; an 
even more powerful beam ac- 
celerator in Europe; these and other 
multi -megabuck installations are 
pouring out data, and some of it is 
finally beginning to fall into place. 
More and more often, physicists are 
able to predict what kind of squig- 
gle they’ll see in their bubble- 
chamber after they send particles 
racing off around the big accelerator 
ring. 

So what good is it? Well, as 
Helmholtz once said, “The most 
practical thing in the world is a 
good theory” Does anyone want to 
argue that James Clerk Maxwell’s 
elegant equations — now appropriate- 
ly emblazoned on t-shirts— didn’t 
change the world? Or that the 
theoretical work of a Swiss patent- 
office clerk hasn't had an effect on 
our lives? There’s at least as much 
potential in the new particle theories 



52 



GALAXY 



as ever there was in e = me 2 . 
Forces (hat don’t decrease with dis- 
tance. Interactions between nuclear 
and electro-magnetic forces. As 
Franklin said of his discovery, what 
use is a newborn baby? 

But (here’s a hitch. The theoreti- 
cal advances in physics come 
largely from new hardware, new 
accelerators, equipment to let physi- 
cists play with the basic building 
blocks of the universe; and (hat 
stuff is expensive. Our last several 
Presidents gulped hard and came up 
with the money for Fermi-lab. Our 
present one seems to have cut out 
every research item that won’t have 
a payoff in the next four years. 

Shuttle delayed: means Large 
Space Telescope delayed. Mean- 
while, a search of the historical re- 
cords reveals the disturbing informa- 
tion that our Sun really is a variable 
star, and that we may live in a 
rather unusual period: that our cli- 
mate might change, and since the 
present climate is about as favorable 
as has ever been in the history of 
the world, the change will likely be 
for (he worse. Studying the Sun 
won’t let us do anything about 
that — but it will let us know what’s 
happening, how long the changes 
will last, and what we’re up 
against. 



There was a lot more, of course. 
Bart J. Bok, formerly of Harvard, 
has a good handle on how stars 
are bom from “pre-proto-stars,” 



namely balls of cold gas called, 
appropriately enough, Bok Glob- 
ules; a great deal about Mars 
from the Viking team, with far 
more to come as the data are 
analyzed; a long symposium on the 
right to die; a day on new informa- 
tion about the polar regions (they’re 
cold); not much on recombinant 
ONA research, probably because 
scientists are afraid to discuss it in 
public; a non -spectacular panel 
analyzing data from various “early 
intervention” programs like Head 
Start and concluding that such 
things really do help, permanently, 
and show a significant economic 
profit in reduced crime rates (and 
that was startling enough for me, 
since I've tended to look at such 
programs with jaundiced eye, and 
must now rethink my position). 

There was one moment of 
triumph, when I saw the very large 
displays on jojoba research, and 
found that, to the bewilderment of 
those involved, the Congress, react- 
ing to constituent letters, had practi- 
cally forced money into their hands. 
So far as I know, many if not most 
of those letters to the Congress 
came from Galaxy readers; I know 
of no other strong attempt to push 
the jojoba bean. 

But there was nothing really spec- 
tacular in Denver. No screaming 
matches that I saw, although my 
wife found herself witnessing some 
excitement among the educational 
psychologists. There were no “e- 
vents” such as the meeting a few 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



53 



years ago when the war protestors 
and Free Speech Movement people 
whapped Senator Hubert Humphrey 
right smack in the mush with a ripe 
tomato, or the time when the Com- 
mittee Against Racism saw to it that 
Professor Page and others were not 
allowed to present their papers. 

I didn't come away from Denver 
with the ferment of excitement that 
I experienced in previous meetings. 
Instead, I kept thinking of that Lin- 
coln quote I opened with. “We 
shall nobly save or meanly lose the 
last best hope of Earth.’’ 

We really are at such a crossroad. 
This generation is blessed — or 
cursed — with the ability to make as 
fundamental an alteration in human 
history as ever was made by the 
discovery of the wheel, the taming 
of animals, the use of fire. For the 
cast of a couple of Apollo pro- 
grams, peanuts really, we could 
give all mankind for all time to 
come boundless energy, energy to 
waste, energy for luxuries; access to 
space and its limitless resources; a 
capability to harness the fundamen- 
tal forces of nature. 

We really could. But — we have 
no national commitment to do so. 
We have no national commitment to 
do anything. At present we really 
do seem in a quandary, unable to 
make a basic choice between 
Appropriate Technology and all its 
philosophical implications, versus a 
concerted national effort to exploit 
technology and science to the ful- 
lest, to commit the resources and 



once and for all end physiological 
want. 

No: we cannot “solve” all 
human problems. We may indeed 
be opening wider Pandora's box. 
There is no certainty that the scien- 
tific djinn will not turn on us. Al- 
ternatively, there is absolute cer- 
tainty that without the djinn most of 
the world faces starvation and pov- 
erty, and we will have to adjust to a 
way of life that may well include 
the bicycle-pedal wheat grinder — 
presuming we have the capability 
even to manufacture those , after the 
crunch. 

In the past I've entitled these an- 
nual reports on the state of the sci- 
ences “This Generation of Won- 
der,” and “Man’s Future: Prog- 
nosis Magnificent,” and I’ve tried 
to leave my readers with some 
sense of the wonder I felt. I wish I 
could do that this year; but I can’t. 
The prognosis could be magnifleent; 
but it is ail too clear that none of 
those marvels will happen automat- 
ically. They’re just too expensive. 
Maybe when it’s steam engine time 
steam engines will appear; but you 
cannot say that about Space Shut- 
tles, and fusion reactors, and Large 
Space Telescopes, and accelerators. 

And yet: it's no small thing, to 
know that we live in a generation 
that could, if we would, make as 
great a contribution to human his- 
tory as ever any did; that we could 
be part of something as important as 
the harnessing of fire and the dis- 
covery of the wheel. ★

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



What is Dosadi? 

Saboteur Extraordinary Jorj X. 
McKie must answer this question after 
trapping himself on the planet of that 

McKie knows that Dosadi’ s 
imprisoned millions are sealed away 
from the rest of the ConSentient 
universe by an englabing barrier under 
the control of a Caleban, The 
Colebans are visible as stars in his 
universe. They provide the 
ConSentiency with jumpdoors through 
which one can walk in one step from 
planet to planet. They are a ‘useful 
mystery’ and some believe them a 
manifestation similar to the Taprisiot, 
stubby, log-like people wha provide 
instant mind-to-mind communication 
across the parsecs. 

Other things McKie knows: 

That the master of Dosadi (those 
outside the barrier ‘God Wall’ or those 
inside) will destroy the planet and all 
of its inhabitants soon unless he can 
solve the undefined problem of this 

He knows that Dosadi is a terrible 
training ground for the recognition of 
and use of power. But this planet’s 
travail is a creation of some among the 
Gowachin Frog People for whom 
testing almost to extinction is a natural 

And there is always something 
beyond McKie’ s knowledge, some other 
mystery about Dosadi which eludes 
him even after he learns that people 
can exchange old bodies for new on 
this planet. 

One of McKie’ $ foremost problems is 
Keila Jedrik, a Human female on 
Dosadi, a new warlord bred and 
trained to free her planet from Us 
secret imprisonment. Jedrik uses 
mental simulation models of all those 



she seeks to control, including those 
unknown to her who imprison Dosadi. 
She reads these latter forces through 
their actions. 

Jedrik has taken McKie as her lover 
but with multiple and profoundly 
Dosadi intent. She uses him for many 
things while teaching him, even 
leaching McKie about himself. 
Through Jedrik, he sees how the 
Gowachin could groom him for this 
role because he was emotionally 
flawed. And as Jedrik shows him the 
cold relationship between two parents 
who serve her, McKie learns that on 
Dosadi love is a means of controlling 
others. To be independent here, you 
reveal no lave. 

Another odd clue about the planet is 
Pcharky, an aged Gowachin Jedrik 
keeps in a cage which Pcharky built. 
The cage glows and hums with stronge 
energies. 

Dosadi has only two sentient species: 
Gowachin and Human. They are 
descended from a memory-erased 
population which volunteered for a 
long-term psychological experiment. 
The descendants, increasingly resistant 
to memory-erasure, know they’re 
puppets in a contrived hell. Dosadi’s 
plants and animals are poisonous to 
both species unless raised in 
hydroponic isolation behind the 
guarded walls of their one city, Chu. 
All around the city, the people of the 
Rim live short, violent lives in a 
scramble far entry into the relative 
purity of Chu. 

McKie arrives at the beginning of a 
race war , not knowing that Jedrik 
ignited this battle of extinction because 
of his arrival, that she considers 
McKie her key to the Gad Wall. 

But McKie also is an agent of the 
ConSentiency’ s Bureau of Sabotage, 



56 



GALAXY 



an ombudsman-like ministry which 
learned about Dosadi's existence, that 
it is a planet imprisoned by a Caleban, 
that it is a Cowaehin crime. 

McKie was the logical choice to seek 
out Dosadi’s location. He had 
developed a relationship with a 
Caleban calling herself Fannie Mae, 
and he is the only living 
ntm-Gowachin admitted to practice 
under Gowachin Law. Gowachin 
distrust law (even their own) saying it 
injures societies. They look first for 
ways to disarm or remove taw when 
problems arise. Above all, Gowochin 
distrust any community or 
professionals, especially legal 
professionals. The ultimate use of 
Gowachin Law is to dissolve old law 
with a concommittanl application of 

Assignment of McKie to the Dosadi 
problem was made by his bureau chief, 
Bildoon, a PanSpechi, whose species 
can ape Human form but passes one 
ego from person to person within a 
five-member creche-family. 

As his first move, McKie accepts a 
summons to the Gowachin home planet 
of Tandaloor, place of their 
mythological progenitor, Mrreg. In 
Gowachin myth, Mrreg was a monster 
who tested the first primitive Frog 
People almost to extinction, setting the 
pattern of their deepest instincts. 

On Tandaloor, McKie meets Aritch, 
High M agister nf the most powerful 
Gowachin Phylum, and a deadly 
Wreave female nomed Ceytang who is 
being trained as a Legum. If McKie 
offends Ceylang, he risks vendetta with 
the gigantic extended family which her 
species creates through marital 
exchanges. 

McKie is forced to become Aritch’ s 
Legum, occepting the Phylum’s sacred 



box containing a book, a knife and a 
rock — symbols of Gowachin Law and 
reminders that any person using this 
legal structure may forfeit his life. 

Sent to Dosadi by Aritch's people, 
McKie soon learns that he cannot 
leave the planet in his existing 
‘body Inode.’ This is part of the 
Caleban contract. But McKie is equally 
concerned with immediate survival as 
Jedrik uses him first in one task and 
then another to help her war against 
the Dosadi Gowachin. 

Opposing Jedrik is the planet’s 
dominant warlord, the Elector Broey, a 
Gowachin who speaks in secret with 
the Caleban of the God Wall. Broey 
knows some things about McKie, 
considers the BuSab agent an idiot 
savant, a weapons expert from beyond 
the barrier. This is partly because 
Jedrik’ s forces have taken McKie' s 
sophisticated BuSab weapons and 
improved upon them for the battle. 

Among Broey’s aides are two 
Humans, the Warlord Gar and Gar’s 
daughter, Tria, who plot to build 
another city on Dosadi in defiance of 
their religious mandate. To keep their 
place in the ruling council, Gar has 
revealed this plot to Broey, who strives 
in the face of a growing cynicism 
about ‘ the God of the Wall,’ to find 
the blasphemous city and destroy it. 

One of Broey’s tools is a Human 
named Havvy, a person from beyond 
the Gad Wall whom Jedrik fudged 
"too flawed” to use as a key to the 
Caleban barrier. 

Gar and Tria have developed a 
suicide force of the Rim born which, 
through Jedrik’s maneuvering, is 
confined to an untenable corridor 
between the forces of Jedrik and 
Broey. Tria sees her impasse and, with 
Gar, submits to capture by Jedrik. 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



57 



A Dosadi-sensilized McKie, watching 
Jedrik’s interrogation af Gar and Tria, 
realizes that Tria was trained by a 
PanSpechi. McKie forces Gar to reveal 
that Tria is not his natural daughter, 
that he found her as on abandoned 
amnesiac child far out on the Rim, 
raised her as his own. This aspect of 
the Dosadi Experiment exposes for 
McKie another of A r itch 's lies: the 
Ritn is not outside the experiment, but 
essential to it. 

How many other lies did Aritch tell? 
The High M agister said the Dosadi 
were ‘monstrous,’ but McKie admires 
their strengths, agreeing that the 
Dosadi may well take over the 
ConSentiency if released from their 
planet. Aritch has said Dosadi was an 
attempt to raise a population resistant 
to all mediocrity imposed from above. 
But there are hidden motives, perhaps 
an attempt to make Gowachin Law the 
basis for all ConSentient Law. McKie 
knows he has been trained os a secret 
pawn in the Dosadi game, but the 
Gowachin are so ultimately civilized 
they have come full circle into 
savagery. 

Jedrik, demonstrating to Gar and 
Tria that McKie really is her 
lieutenant, sends him into danger to 
solve a battle problem at one of the 
city's inner gates. McKie wins the 
bottle and questions captives. One is a 
Gowachin with scroll-like scars on his 
eyelids, a poorly erased Phylum tatoo. 
Making formal demand as a Legum, 
McKie forces the captive to reveal that 
only sixty hours remain before Dosadi 
is destroyed, that ' ‘Mrreg sent me to 
gel our people out of here. ” 

Another prisoner is Havvy, who 
reveals that Pcharky is intended to 
transfer McKie's identity into Jedrik’s 
body and Jedrik into McKie, giving her 

5B 



the perfect disguise for escaping from 
Dosadi. However, McKie recognizes 
something else — that a Caleban looks 
out through Navvy’s eyes. Sending a 
message through this Caleban, McKie 
warns Aritch to adhere to the 
traditional relationship between Legum 
and Client lest all Gowachin be targets 
for extermination. 

McKie, his mind threading through 
the layers within layers of the Dosadi 
problem, returns to Jedrik and gives 
her the essential datum for 
overwhelming Broey: use the fanatics 
offered by Gar and Tria to attack the 
Gowachin graluz breeding pools. 
Jedrik fust sends word af this threat to 
Broey, then tells McKie to go back to 
their room with her, that it’s time for 
their showdown. McKie obeys 
wondering: Is it to be body exchange? 

Back on Tandaloor, Ceylang has 
been watching simulations and actual 
scenes of McKie’s performance on 
Dosadi. She tells Aritch: “Sometimes I 
think those Dosadi play us like a fine 
instrument.” 

Aritch: “Of course! That’s why we 
sent them McKie. ” 



Geriatric or ofher life extension for 
the powerful poses a similar threat to 
a sentient species as that found histor- 
ically in the dominance of a self- 
perpetuoting bureaucracy. Both 
assume prerogatives of immortality, 
collecting more ond more power with 
each passing moment. This is power 
which draws a theological aura about 
itself — the unassailable Law, the 
Gad-given mandote of the leader, 
manifest destiny. Power held too long 
within a narrow framework moves 
farther and farther oway from the 



GALAXY 



adaptiva demands of changed 
conditions. The leadership grows ever 
more paranoid, suspicious of inventive 
adaptations to change, fearfully 
protective of persanol power and, in 
the terrified avoidance of what it sees 
os risk, blindly- leads its people into 
destruction. 

— BuSab Manual 



“Very well. I’ll tell you what 
bothers me,” Ceylang said. “There 
are too many things about this prob- 
lem that I fail to understand.” 

From her seated position, she 
looked across a small round room at 
Aritch, who floated gently in a tiny 
blue pool. His head at the pool’s lip 
was almost on a level with 
Ceylang’s. Again, they had worked 
late into the night. She understood 
the reasons for this, the time pres- 
sures were quite apparent, but the 
peculiar Gowachin flavor of her 
training kept her in an almost con- 
stant state of angry questioning. 

This whole thing was so un- 
Wreave! 

Ceylang smoothed the robe over 
her long body. The robe was blue 
now, one step away from Legum 
black. Appropriately, there was blue 
all around her — the walls, the floor, 
the ceiling, Aritch ’s pool. 

The High M agister rested his chin 
on the pool's edge to speak. 

“I require specific questions be- 
fore I can even hope to penetrate 
your puzzlement.” 

“Will McKie defend or prose- 
cute? The simulator ...” 



“Damn the simulator! Odds are 
that he'll make the mistake of pro- 
secuting. Your own reasoning powers 
should ...” 

“But if he doesn’t?” 

“Then selection of the judicial 
panel becomes vital.” 

Ceylang twisted her body to one 
side, feeling the chairdog adjust for 
her comfort. As usual, Aritch ’s an- 
swer only deepened her sense of 
uncertainty. She voiced that now. 

“I continue to have this odd feel- 
ing that you intend me to play some 
role which I’m not supposed to dis- 
cover until the very last instant.” 

Aritch breathed noisily through 
his mouth, splashed water onto his 
head. 

“This all may be moot. By this 
time day after tomorrow, Dosadi 
and McKie may no longer exist.” 

“Then I will not advance to 
Legum?” 

“Oh, I’m fairly certain you’ll be 
a Legum.” 

She studied him, sensing irony, 
then: 

“What a delicate line you walk, 
High Magister.” 

“Hardly. My way is wide and 
clear. You know the things I cannot 
countenance. I cannot betray the 
Law or my people.” 

“I have similar inhibitions. But 
this Dosadi thing ... so tempt- 
ing.” 

“So dangerous! Would a Wreave 
don Human flesh to learn the 
Human condition? Would you per- 
mit a Human to penetrate Wreave 
society in this ...” 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT

"There are some who might con- 
spire in this! There are even 
Gowachin who ...” 

“The opportunities for misuse are 
countless." 

“Yet you say that McKie already 
is more Gowachin than a 
Gowachin." 

Aritch’s webbed hands folded 
over the pool’s edge. The claws ex- 
tended. 

“We risked much in training him 
for this task.” 

"More than you risk with me?" 

Aritch withdrew his hands, stared 
at her, unblinking. 

“So that’s what bothers you.” 

“Precisely.” 

“Think, Ceylang, how near the 
core of Wreavedom you would 
permit me to come. Thus far and no 
farther will we permit you.” 

“And McKie?” 

“May already have gone too far 
for us to permit his continued ex- 
istence.” 

“I heed your wanting, Aritch. 
But I remain puzzled as to why the 
Calebans couldn’t prevent ...” 

“They profess not to understand 
the ego transfer. But who can un- 
derstand a Caleban, let alone con- 
trol one in a matter so delicate? 
Even this one who created the God 
Wall . .” 

“It’s rumored that McKie under- 
stands Calebans.” 

“He denies it.” 

She rubbed her pocked left jowl 
with prehensile mandible, felt the 
many scars of her passage through 
the W reave triads. Family to family 



until it was a single gigantic family. 
Yet, all were Wreave. This Dosadi 
thing threatened a monstrous parody 
of Wreavedom. Still . 

“So fascinating,” she murmured. 

“That’s its threat.” 

“We should pray for the death of 
Dosadi.” 

“Perhaps.” 

She was startled. 

“What ...” 

“This might not die with Dosadi. 
Our sacred bond assures that you 
will leave here with this knowledge. 
Many Gowachin know of this 
thing.” 

“And McKie.” 

“Infections have a way of spread- 
ing," Aritch said. “Remember that 
if this comes to the Court-arena.” 



There are some forms of insonity 
which, driven to on ultimate expres- 
sion, can become the new models of 
sanity. 

— BuSab 



"McKie?” 

It was the familiar Caleban pres- 
ence in his awareness, as though he 
heard and felt someone (or some- 
thing) which he knew was not 
there. 

The preparation had been decep- 
tively simple. He and Jedrik clasped 
hands, his right hand and her left, 
and each grasped one of the shim- 
mering rods with the other hand. 

McKie did not have a ready iden- 



60 



GALAXY 



tify for this C ale ban and wondered 
at the questioning in her voice. He 
agreed, however, that he was in- 
deed McKie, shaping the thought as 
subvocalized conversation. As he 
spoke, McKie was acutely aware of 
Jedrik beside him. She was more 
than just another person now. He 
canied a tentative simulation model 
of her, sometimes anticipating her 
responses. 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



“You make mutual agreement?” 
the Caleban asked. 

McKie sensed Pcharky then: a 
distant presence, the monitor for 
this experience. It was as though 
Pcharky had been reduced to a 
schematic which the Caleban fol- 
lowed, a set of complex rules many 
of which could not be translated 
into words. Some part of McKie re- 
sponded to this as though a monster 
61 



awakened within him, a sleeping 
monster who sat up full of anger at 
being aroused thus, demanding: 

‘‘Who is it that dares awaken 
me?” 

McKie felt his body trembling, 
felt Jedrik trembling beside him. 
The Caleban/Taprisiot- trembling, the 
sweaty response to trance! He 
saw these phenomena now in a dif- 
ferent light. When you walked at 
the edge of this abyss . 

While these thoughts passed 
through his mind, he felt a slight 
shift, no more than the blurred re- 
flection of something which was not 
quite movement. Now, while he 
still felt his own flesh around him, 
he also felt himself possessed of an 
inner contact with Jedrik's body and 
knew she shared this experience. 

Such a panic as he had not 
thought possible threatened to 
overwhelm him. He felt Jedrik try- 
ing to break the contact, to stop this 
hideous sharing, but they were 
powerless in the grip of a force 
which would not be stopped. 

No time sense attached itself to 
this experience, but a fatalistic calm 
overcame them almost simulta- 
neously. McKie felt awareness of 
Jedrik/flesh deepen. Curiosity domi- 
nated him now. 

So this is woman! 

This is man? 

They shared the thoughts across 
an indistinct bridge. 

Fascination gripped McKie. He 
probed deeper. 

He/she could feel himself/herself 



breathing. And the differences! It 
was not the genitalia, the presence 
or lack of breasts. She felt bereft of 
breasts. He felt acutely distressed 
by their presence, self-consciously 
aware of profound implications. The 
sense of difference went back be- 
yond gamete McKie/Jedrik. 

McKie sensed her thoughts, her 
reactions. 

Jedrik sensed him in the same 
way. 

Jedrik: “You cast your sperm 
upon the stream of time.” 

McKie: “You enclose and nur- 
ture . .” 

“I cast/I nurture.” 

It was as though they looked at 
an object from opposite sides, 
aware belatedly that they both 
examined the same thing. 

“We cast/we nurture." 

Obscuring layers folded away and 
McKie found himself in Jedrik's 
mind, she in his. Their thoughts 
were one entity. 

The separate Dosadi and ConSen- 
tient experiences melted into a sin- 
gle relationship. 

“Aritch . .ah, yes. You see? 
And your PanSpechi friend, Bil- 
doon. Note that. You suspected, but 
now you know ...” 

Each set of experiences fed on 
the other, expanding, refining . 
condensing, discarding, creating . 
creating ... 

So that’s the training of a Legum. 

Loving parents? Ahhh, yes, lov- 
ing parents. 

“I/we wilt apply pressure 



62 



GALAXY 



there ... and there . They must 
be maneuvered into choosing that 
one as a judge. Yes, that will give 
us the required leverage. Let them 
break their own code.” 

And the awakened monster stirred 
within them. It had no dimension, 
no place, only existence. They felt 
its power. 

' 7 do what / do’’ ’ 

The power enveloped them. No 
other awareness was permitted. 
They sensed a primal current, un- 
swerving purpose, a force which 
could override any other thing in 
their universe. It was not God, not 
Life, not any particular species. It 
was something so far beyond such 
articulations that Jedrik/McKie could 
not even contemplate it without a 
sense that the next instant would 
bring obliteration. 

They felt a question hurled at 
their united, fearful awareness. The 
question was framed squarely in 
anger, astonishment, cold amuse- 
ment and threat. 

“For this you awaken me?” 

Now, they understood why the 
old body and donor-ego had always 
been slain immediately. This terri- 
ble sharing made a . made a 
noise. It awakened a questioner. 

They understood the question 
without words, knowing they could 
never grasp the full meaning and 
emotive thrust, that it would bum 
them out even to try. Anger . .as- 
tonishment . cold amusement 
. threat. The question as their 
own united mind(s) interpreted it 



represented a limit. It was all that 
Jedrik/McKie could accept. 

The intrusive questioner receded. 
They were never quite sure af- 
terward whether they’d been expel- 
led or whether they’d fled in terror, 
but the parting words were burned 
into their combined awareness. 

“Let the sleeper sleep.’’ 

They walked softly in their minds 
then. They understood the warning, 
but knew it could never be trans- 
lated in its fullest threat for any 
other sentient being. 



Concurrent: McKie/Jedrik felt a 
projection of terror from the God 
Wall Caleban, unfocused, unex- 
plained. It was a new experience in 
the male-female collective memory. 
Caleban Fannie Mae had not even 
projected this upon original McKie 
when she’d thought herself doomed. 

Concurrent: McKie/Jedrik felt a 
bumt-out-fading from Pcharky. 
Something in that terrible contact 
had plunged Pcharky into his death 
spiral. Even as McKie/Jedrik re- 
alized this, the old Gowachin died. 
It was a slammed door. But this 
came after a blazing realization by 
McKie/Jedrik that Pcharky had 
shared the original decision to set 
up the Dosadi experiment. 

McKie found himself clothed in 
living, breathing flesh which routed 
its messages through his awareness. 
He wasn’t sure which of their two 
bodies he possessed, but it was dis- 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



63 



tinct, separate. It wrapped him in 
Human senses: the taste of salt, the 
smell of perspiration and the om- 
nipresent Warren stink. One hand 
held cold metal; the other clasped 
the hand of a fellow Human. Pers- 
piration drenched this body, made 
the clasped hands slippery. He felt 
that knowing which hand held 
another hand was of utmost impor- 
tance, but he wasn’t ready to face 
that knowledge. Awareness of self, 
this new self, and a whole lifetime 
of new memories, demanded all of 
the attention he could muster. 

Focus: A Rim city, never outside 
Jedrik’s control because she had fed 
the signals through to Gar and Tria 
with exquisite care and because 
those who gave the orders on the 
Rim had shared in the generations 
of selective breeding which had 
produced Jedrik. She was a biologi- 
cal weapon whose sole target was 
the God Wall. 

Focus: Loving parents can thrust 
their child into deadly peril when 
they know everything possible has 
been done to prepare that child for 
survival. 

The oddity to McKie was that he 
felt such things as personal 
memories. 

“I did that.” 

Jedrik suffered the throes of simi- 
lar experiences. 

Which body? 

So that was the training of a 
BuSab agent. Clever . .almost 
adequate. Complex and full of 
much that she found to be new, but 



why did it always stop short of a 
full development? 

She reviewed the sessions with 
Aritch and Ceylang. A matched 
pair. The choice of Ceylang and the 
role chosen for her appeared obvi- 
ous. How innocent! Jedrik felt her- 
self free to pity Ceylang. When al- 
lowed to run its course, this was an 
interesting emotion. She had never 
before felt pity in un colored purity. 

Focus: McKie actually loved her. 
She savored this emotion in its 
ConSentient complexity. The straight 
flow of selected emotions fasci- 
nated her. They did not have to be 
bridled! 

In and out of this creative ex- 
change there wove an intimacy, a 
pure sexuality without inhibitions. 

McKie, savoring the amusement 
Jedrik had felt when Tria had 
suggested a McKie/Jedrik breeding, 
found himself caught by demanding 
male eroticism and knew by the 
sensation that he retained his old 
body. 

Jedrik, understanding McKie's 
long search for a female to com- 
plete him, found her amusement 
converted to the desire to demon- 
strate that completion. 

As she turned toward him, releas- 
ing the dull rod which had once 
shimmered in contact with Pcharky, 
she found herself in McKie’s flesh 
looking into her own eyes. 

McKie gasped in the mirror ex- 
perience. 

Just as abruptly, driven by shock, 
they shifted back into familiar flesh: 



64 



GAiAXY 



McKie male, Jedrik female. In- 
stantly, it became a thing to 
explore — back and forth. Eroticism 
was forgotten in this new game. 

“We can be either sex/body at 
will!” 

It was something beyond Tap- 
risiots or Calebans, far more subtle 
than the crawling progression of a 
PanSpechi ego through the bodies 
from its creche. 

They knew the source of this odd 
gift even as they sank back on the 
bed, content to be familiar male and 
female for a time. 

The Monster. 

This was a gift with barbs in it, 
something loving parents might give 
their child in the knowledge that it 
was time for this lesson. Yet they 
felt revitalized, knowing they had 
for an instant tapped an energy 
source without limits. 

A pounding on the door inter- 
rupted this shared reverie. 

“Jedrik! Jedrik!” 

“What is it?” 

“It’s Broey. He wishes to talk to 
McKie.” 

They were off the bed in an in- 
stant. 

Jedrik glanced at McKie, know- 
ing she had not one secret from 
him, that they shared a reasoning 
base. Out of the mutual understand- 
ing in this base, she spoke for both 
of them. 

“Does he say why?” 

“Jedrik. .” 

They both recognized the voice 
of a trusted aide and heard the fear 



in it. 

“. it’s midmoming and there 
is no sun. God has turned off the 

“Sealed u$ in . .” 

“. to conceal the final blast.” 

Jedrik opened the door, con- 
fronted the frightened aide. 

“Where is Broey?” 

“Here ... in your command 
post. He came alone without es- 
cort.” 

She glanced at McKie. “You will 
speak for us.” 

Broey waited near the position 
board in the command post. Watch- 
ful Humans stood within striking 
distance. He turned as McKie and 
Jedrik entered. McKie noted that 
the Gowachin’s body was, indeed, 
heavy with breeding juices as an- 
ticipated. Unsettling for a 
Gowachin. 

“What are your terms, McKie?” 

Broey ’s voice was gutteral, full 
of heavy breathing. 

McKie ’s features remained 

Dosadi-bland, but he thought; Broey 
thinks I'm responsible for the dark- 
ness. He’s terrified. 

McKie glanced at the threatening 
black of the windows before speak- 
ing. He knew this Gowachin from 
Jedrik ’$ painstaking study. Broey 
was a sophisticate, a collector of 
sophistication who surrounded him- 
self with people of the same stripe. 
He was a professional sophisticate 
who read everything through that 
peculiar Dosadi screen. No one 
could come into his circle who 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



65 



didn’t share this pose. All else re- 
mained outside and inferior. He was 
an ultimate Dosadi, a distillation, 
almost as Human as Gowachin be- 
cause he'd obviously once worn a 
Human body. He was Gowachin at 
his origins, (hough ... no doubt of 
it. 

“You followed my scent,” 
McKje said. 

“Excellent!” Broey brightened. 
He had not expected a Dosadi ex- 
change, pared to the non-emotional 
essentials. 

‘ ‘ Unfortunately , ’ ’ McKie said , 
“you have no position from which 
to negotiate. Certain things will be 
done. You will comply willingly, 
your compliance will be forced, or 
we will act without you.” 

It was a deliberate goading on 
McKie ’s part, a choice of non- 
Dosadi forms to abbreviate this con- 
frontation. It said more than any- 
thing else that McKie came from be- 
yond the God Wall, that the dark- 
ness which held back the daylight 
was the least of his resources. 

Broey hesitated, then: 

“So?” 

The single word fell on the air 
with countless implications: an en- 
tire exchange discarded, hopes 
dashed, a hint of sadness at lost 
powers, and still with that sophisti- 
cated reserve which was Broey ’s 
signature. It was more subtle than a 
shrug, more powerful in its Dosadi 
overtones than an entire negotiating 
session. 

"Questions?” McKie asked. 



Broey glanced at Jedrik, ob- 
viously surprised by (his. It was as 
though he appealed to her: They 
were both Dosadi, were they not? 
This outsider came here with his 
gross manners, his lack of Dosadi 
understanding. How could one 
speak to such a one? He addressed 
Jedrik. 

“Have I not already stated my 
submission. I came alone, I . .” 

Jedrik picked up McKie ’s cue. 

“There are certain . .pecu- 
liarities to our situation.” 

“Peculiarities?” 

Broey’ s nictating membrane 

blinked once. 

Jedrik allowed her manner to 
convey a slight embarrassment. 

“Certain delicacies of the Dosadi 
condition must be overlooked. We 
are now, all of us, abject suppli- 
cants . and we are dealing with 
people who do not speak as we 
speak, act as we act . .” 

"Yes.” He pointed upward. 
“The mentally retarded ones. We 
are in danger then.” 

It was not a question. Broey 
peered upward, as though trying to 
see through the ceiling and interven- 
ing floors. He drew in a deep 
breath. 

“Yes.” 

Again, it was compressed com- 
munication. Anyone who could put 
the God Wall there could crush an 
entire planet. Therefore, Dosadi and 
all of its inhabitants had been 
brought to a common subjection. 
Only a Dosadi could have accepted

it this quickly without more 
questions and Broey was an ulti- 
mate Dosadi. 

McKic turned to Jedrik. When he 
spoke, she anticipated every word, 
but she waited him out. 

“Tell your people to stop all at- 
tacks.” 

He faced Broey. 

“And your people.” 

Broey looked from Jedrik to 
McKie, back to Jedrik with a puz- 
zled expression openly on his face, 
but he obeyed. 

“Which communicator?” 



Where pain predominates, agony can 
be a valued teacher. 

— Dosadi Aphorism 



McKic and Jedrik had no need to 
discuss (he decision. It was a choice 
which they shared and knew they 
shared through a memory- selection 
process now common to both of 
them. There was a loophole in the 
God Wall and even though that wall 
now blanketed Dosadi in darkness, 
a C ale ban contract was still a Cale- 
ban contract. The vital question was 
whether the Caleban of the God 
Wall would respond. 

Jedrik in McKie’s body stood 
guard outside her own room while a 
Jedrik-fleshed McKie went alone 
into the room to make the attempt. 



Who should he try to contact? Fan- 
nie Mae? The absolute darkness 
which enclosed Dosadi hinted at an 
absolute withdrawal of (he guardian 
Caleban. And there was so little 
time. 

McKie sat cross-legged on the 
floor of the room and tried to clear 
his mind. The constant strange dis- 
coveries in the female body he now 
wore interfered with concentration. 
The moment of exchange left an af- 
tershock which he doubted would 
ever diminish. They had but to 
share the desire for the change now 
and it occurred. But this different 
body . ahh, the multiplicity of 
differences created its own confu- 
sions. These went far beyond the 
adjustments to different height and 
weight. The muscles of his-her arms 
and hips felt wrongly attached. The 
bodily senses were routed through 
different unconscious processes. 
Anatomy created its own patterns, 
its own instinctual behavior. For 
one thing, he found it necessary 
to develop consciously-monitored 
movements which protected his/her 
breasts. The movements were re- 
miniscent of those male adjustments 
by which he prevented injury to 
testes. These were movements 
which a male learned early and re- 
legated to an automatic behavior 
pattern. The problem in the female 
body was that he had to think about 
such behavior. And it went far be- 
yond the breast/testes interlock. 

As he tried to clear his mind for 
the Caleban contact, these webbed 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



67 



clusters of memory intruded. It was 
maddening. He needed to clear 
away bodily distractions, but this 
female body demanded his atten- 
tion. In desperation, he hyper- 
ventilated and burned his awareness 
into a pineal focus whose dangers 
he knew only too well. This was 
the way to permanent identity loss 
if the experience was prolonged. It 
produced a sufficient clarity, how- 
ever, that he could fill his aware- 
ness with memories of Fannie Mae. 

Silence. 

He sensed time’s passage as 
though each heartbeat were a blow. 

Fear hovered at the edge of the 
silence. 

It came to him that something 
had put a terrible fear into the God 
Wall Caleban. 

McKie felt anger. 

“Caleban! You owe me!” 

"McKie?” 

The response was so faint that he 
wondered whether it might be his 
hopes playing tricks on him. 

“Fannie Mae?” 

That was stronger and he rec- 
ognized the familiar Caleban pres- 
ence in his awareness. 

“I am McKie and you owe me a 
debt.” 

“If you are truly McKie . .why 
are you so. .strange. .changed?” 

"I .wear another body.” 

McKie was never sure, but he 
thought he sensed consternation. 
Fannie Mae responded more 
strongly then. 

“I remove McKie from Dosadi 



now? Contract permits.” 

“1 will share Dosadi’s fate.” 
“McKie!” 

“Don’t argue with me, Fannie 
Mae. I will share Dosadi’s fate un- 
less you remove another node/ 
person with me.” 

He projected Jedrik’s pattern 
then, an easy process since he 
shared all of her memories. 

“She wears McKie ‘s body!” 

It was accusatory. 

“She wears another body,” 
McKie, said. He knew the Caleban 
saw his new relationship with Jed- 
rik. Everything depended now on 
the interpretation of the Caleban 
contract. 

“Jedrik is Dosadi,” the Caleban 
protested. 

“So am I Dosadi . .now." 

“But you are McKie!” 

“And Jedrik is also McKie. Con- 
tact her if you don't believe me.” 

He broke the contact with an 
angry abruptness, found himself 
sprawled on the floor, still twitch- 
ing. Perspiration bathed the female 
body which he still wore. The head 
ached. 

Would Fannie Mae do as he’d 
told her? He knew Jedrik was as 
capable of projecting his awareness 
as he was of projecting hers. How 
would Fannie Mae interpret the 
Dosadi contract? 

Gods! The ache in his head was a 
burning thing. He felt alien in Jed- 
rik’s body, misused. The pain per- 
sisted and he wondered if he’d done 
irreparable harm to Jedrik’s brain 



GALAXY 



through that intense pineal focus. 

Slowly, he pushed himself up- 
right, got to his feet. The Jedrik 
legs felt weak beneath him. He 
thought of Jedrik outside that door 
trembling in the zombie-like trance 
required for this mind-to-mind con- 
tact. What was taking so long? Had 
the Calebans withdrawn? 

Have we lost? 

He started for the door but before 
he’d taken the second step, light 
blazed around him. For a fractional 
heartbeat he thought it was the final 
fire to consume Dosadi, but the 
light held steady. He glanced 
around, found himself in the open 
air. It was a place he recognized 
immediately: the courtyard of the 
Dry Head compound on Tandaloor. 
He saw the familiar phylum designs 
on the surrounding walls — green 
Gowachin script on yellow bricks. 
There was the sound of water 
splashing in the comer pool. A 
group of Gowachin stood in an 
arched entry directly ahead of him 
and he recognized one of his old 
teachers. Yes . this was a Dry 
Head sanctus. These people had 
protected him, trained him, intro- 
duced him to their most sacred se- 
crets. 

The Gowachin in the shadowed 
entry were moving excitedly into 
the courtyard, their attention cen- 
tered on a figure sprawled near 
them. The figure stirred, sat up. 

McKie recognized his own body 
there. 

Jedrik! 



It was an intense mutual need. 
The body exchange required less 
than an eyeblink. McKie found 
himself in his own familiar body, 
seated on cool tiles. The approach- 
ing Gowachin bombarded him with 
questions. 

“McKie, what is this?” 

“You fell through ajumpdoor!" 

“Are you hurt?” 

He waved the questions away, 
crossed his legs and fell into the 
long-call trance focused on that 
bead in his stomach. That bead Bil- 
doon had never expected him to 
use! 

As it was paid to do, the Tap- 
risiot waiting on CC enfolded his 
awareness. McKie rejected contact 
with Bildoon, made six calls 
through the responsive Taprisiot. 
The calls went to key agents in 
BuSab, all of them ambitious and 
resourceful, all of them completely 
loyal to the agency’s mandate. He 
transmitted his Dosadi information 
in full bursts, using the technique 
derived from his exchanges with 
Jedrik — mind-to-mind . 

There were few questions and 
those easily answered. 

“The Caleban who holds Dosadi 
imprisoned plays God. It’s the letter 
of the contract.” 

“Do the Calebans approve of 
this?” 

That question came from a par- 
ticularly astute Wreave agent sensi- 
tive to the complications implicit in 
the fact that the Gowachin were 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



69 



training Ceylang, a Wreave female, 
as a Legum. 

“The concepts of approval or 
disapproval are not applicable. The 
role was necessary for that Caleban 
to carry out the contract.” 

"It was a game?” 

The Wreave agent was outraged. 

"Perhaps. There’s one thing cer- 
tain: the Calebans don't understand 
harmful behavior and ethics as we 
understand them.” 

“We’ve always known that.” 

“But now we’ve realty learned 
■it.” 

When he’d made the six calls, 
McKic sent his Taprisiot questing 
for Aritch, found the High Magister 
in the Running Phylum’s conference 
pool. 

“Greetings, Client.” 

McKie projected wry amusement. 
He sensed the Gowachin’s shock. 

“There are certain things which 
your Legum instructs you to do 
under the holy seal of our relation- 
ship,” McKie said. 

"You will take us into the Coun- 
arena, then?” 

The High Magister was percep- 
tive and he was a beneficiary of 
Dosadi’s peculiar gifts, but he was 
not a Dosadi. McKie found it rela- 
tively easy to manipulate Aritch 
now, enlisting the High Magister's 
deepest motivations. When Aritch 
protested against cancelling the God 
Wall contract, McKie revealed only 
the first layer of stubborn determi- 
nation. 

“You will not add to your 



Legum ’s difficulties,” McKie said. 

“But what will keep them on 
Dosadi?" 

“Nothing.” 

“Then you will defend rather 
than prosecute?” 

“Ask your pet Wreave,” McKie 
said. “Ask Ceylang.” 

He broke the contact then, know- 
ing Aritch could only obey him. 
The High Magister had few choices, 
most of them bad ones. And 
Gowachin Law prevented him from 
disregarding his Legum ’s orders 
once the pattern of the contest was 
set. 

McKie awoke from the call to 
find his Dry Head friends clustered 
around Jedrik. She was explaining 
their predicament. Yes . there 
were advantages to having (wo 
bodies with one purpose. McKie got 
to his feet. She saw him, spoke. 

“My head feels better.” 

“It was a near thing.” And he 
added: 

“It still is. But Dosadi is free.” 



In the classical times of several species 
it was the custom of the powerful to 
nudge the power -counters (money or 
other economic tabulators, status 
points, etc.) into occasional violent 
perturbations from which the knowl- 
edgeable few profiled. Human 
accounts of this experience reveal 
edifying examples of this behavior (for 
which, see Appendix G). Only the 
PanSpechi appear to have avoided

this phenomenon, possibly because of 
creche slavery.' 

— Comparative History, 
The BuSab Text 



McKie made his next series of 
calls from the room the Dry Heads 
set aside for him. It was a relatively 
large room reserved for Human 
guests and contained well -trained 
chairdogs and a wide bedog which 
Jedrik eyed with suspicion despite 
her McKie memories of such 
things. She knew the things had 
only a rudimentary brain, but still 
they were . alive. 

She stood by the single window 
which looked out on the counyard 
pool, turning when she heard 
McKie awaken from his Taprisiot 
calls. 

“Suspicions confirmed,” he said. 

“Will our agent friends leave 
Bildoon for us?” she asked. 

“Yes.” 

She turned back to the window. 

“1 keep thinking how the Dosadi 
sky must look now . without a 
God Wall. As bright as this.” She 
nodded toward the courtyard seen 
through the window. “And when 
we get jumpdoors ...” 

She broke off. McKie, of course, 
shared such thoughts. This new in- 
timacy required considerable ad- 
justment. 

“I’ve been thinking about your 
training as a Legum,” she said. 



McKie knew where her thoughts 
had gone. The Gowachin chosen to 
train him had all appeared open in 
their relationship. He had been told 
that his teachers were a select 
group, chosen for excellence, the 
best available for the task: making a 
Gowachin out of a non -Gowachin. 

A silk purse from a iow'r ear! 

His teachers had appeared to lead 
conventional Gowachin lives, keep- 
ing the usual numbers of fertile 
females in family tanks, weeding 
the graluz tads with necessary 
Gowachin abandon. On the surface 
of it, the whole thing had assumed 
a sense of the ordinary. They had 
introduced him to intimate aspects 
of their lives when he’d inquired, 
answered his questions with disarm- 
ing frankness. 

McKie’s Jedrik -amplified aware- 
ness saw this in a different light 
now. The contests between 
Gowachin phy turns stood out sharply. 
And McKie knew now that he 
had not asked the right questions, 
that his teachers had been selected 
by different rules than those re- 
vealed to him at the time, that their 
private instructions from their 
Gowachin superiors contained 
nuances of vital importance which 
had been hidden from their student. 

Poor Ceylang. 

There were unsettling reflections. 
They changed his understanding of 
Gowachin honor, called into ques- 
tion all of those inadvertent com- 
parisons he’d made between 
Gowachin forms and the mandate of 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



71 



his own BuSab. His BuSab training 
came in for the same questioning 
examination. 

Why . why . why . why 

Law? Gowachin Law? 

The value in having a BuSab 
agent as a Legum of the Gowachin 
had gained a new dimension. 
McKie saw these matters now as 
Jedrik had once seen through the 
God Wall. There existed other 
forces only dimly visible behind the 
visible screen. An unseen power 
structure lay out there — people who 
seldom appeared in public, decision 
makers whose slightest whim car- 
ried terrible import for countless 
worlds. Many places, many worlds 
would be held in various degrees of 
bondage. Dosadi had merely been 
an extreme case for a special pur- 
pose. 

New bodies for old. Immortality. 
And a training ground for people 
who made terrible decisions. 

But none of them would be as 
completely Dosadi as this Jedrik- 
amplified McKie. 

He wondered where the Dosadi 
decision had been made. Aritch had 
not shared in it; that was obvious. 
There were others behind Aritch — 
Gowachin and non-Gowachin. A 
shadowy power group existed. It 
could have its seat on any world of 
the ConSentiency. The power mer- 
chants would have to meet occa- 
sionally but not necessarily face to 
face. And never in the public eye. 
Their first rule was secrecy. They 
would employ many people who 



lived at the exposed fringes of their 
power, people to carry out shadowy 
commands . people such as 
Aritch. 

And Bildoon. 

What had the PanSpechi hoped to 
gain? A permanent hold on his 
creche’s ego? Of course. That . 
plus new bodies . Human 
bodies, undoubtedly, and unmarked 
by the stigmata of his PanSpechi 
origins. 

Bildoon ’s behavior . and 
Aritch’s 

appeared so transparent now. And 
there' d be a Mrreg nearby creating 
the currents in which Aritch swam. 
Puppet leads to Puppet Master. 

Mrreg. 

That poor fool, Grinik, had re- 
vealed more than he thought. 

And Bildoon. 

“We have two points of entry,” 
McKie said. 

She agreed. 

“Bildoon and Mregg. The latter 
is the more dangerous.” 

A crease beside McKie ’s nose 
began to itch. He scratched at it ab- 
sently, grew conscious that some- 
thing had changed. He stared 
around, found himself standing at 
the window and clothed in a female 
body. 

Damn! It happened so easily. 

Jedrik stared up at him with his 
own eyes. She spoke with his 
voice, but the overtones were pure 
Jedrik. They both found this amus- 
ing. 

"The powers of your BuSab.” 



72 



GALAXY 



He understood. 

“Yes, the watchdogs of justice.” 

“Where were the watchdogs 
when my ancestors were lured into 
this Dosadi trap?” 

“Watchdogs of justice, very 
dangerous role,” he agreed. 

“You know our feelings of out- 
rage,” she said. 

“And I know what it is to have 
loving parents.” 

“Remember that when you talk 
to Bildoon." 

Once more, McKie found himself 
on the bed, his old familiar body 
around him. 

Presently, he felt the mental ten- 
drils of a Taprisiot call, sensed Bil- 
doon's awareness in contact with 
him. McKie wasted no time. The 
shadow forces were taking the bait. 

“I have located Dosadi. The 
issue will come to the Courtarena. 
No doubt of that. I want you to 
make the preliminary arrangements. 
Inform the High Magister Aritch 
that I make the formal imposition of 
the Legum. One member of the judi- 
cial panel must be a Gowachin 
from Dosadi. I have a particular 
Gowachin in mind. His name is 
Broey.” 

“Where are you?” 

“On Tandaloor.” 

“Is that possible?” 

McKic masked his sadness. Ahh , 
Bildoon, how easily you are read. 

“Dosadi is temporarily out of 
danger. I have taken certain re- 
taliatory precautions.” 

McKie broke the contact. 



Jedrik spoke in a musing voice. 

“Ohh, the perturbations we 
spread.” 

McKie had no time for reflec- 
tions. 

“Broey will need help, a support 
team, an extremely reliable troop 
which I want you to select for 
him.” 

“Yes, and what of Gar and 
Tria?” 

“Let them run free. Broey will 
pick them up later.” 



Communal/managed economics have 
always been more destructive of their 
societies than those driven by greed. 
This is whot Dosadi says: Greed sets 
its own limits, is self -regulating. 

— The Dosadi Anolysis/BuSab Text 



McKie looked around the Legum 
office they’d assigned him. Af- 
ternoon smells from Tandaloor’s 
fern jungles came in an open win- 
dow. A low barrier separated him 
from the Courtarena with its ranks 
of seats all around. His office and 
adjoining quarters were small but 
fitted with all requisite linkages to 
libraries and the infrastructure to 
summon witnesses and experts. It 
was a green-walled space so decep- 
tively ordinary that its like had be- 
guiled more than one non -Gowachin 
into believing he knew how to per- 
form here. But these quarters rep- 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



73 



resented a deceptive surface riding 
on Gowachin currents. No matter 
that the Consentient Pact modified 
what the Gowachin might do here, 
this was Tandaloor and the forms of 
the frog people dominated. 

Seating himself at the single table 
in the office space, McKie felt the 
chairdog adjust itself beneath him. 
It was good to have a chairdog 
again after Dosadi’s unrelenting 
furniture. He flipped a toggle and 
addressed the Gowachin face which 
appeared on the screen inset into his 
table. 

“I require testimony from those 
who made the actual decision to set 
up the Dosadi experiment. Are you 
prepared to meet this request?” 

“Do you have the names of these 
people?” 

Did this fool think he was going 
to blurt out: “Mrreg?” 

“If you force me to it,” McKie 
warned, “I will bind Aritch to the 
Law and extract the names from 
him.” 

This had no apparent effect on 
the Gowachin. He addressed McKie 
by name and title, adding: 

“I leave the formalities to you. 
Any witness I summon must have a 
name.” 

McKie suppressed a smile. Sus- 
picions confirmed. This was a fact 
which the watchful Gowachin in the 
screen was late recognizing. Some- 
one else had read the interchange 
correctly, however. Another, older, 
Gowachin face replaced the first 
one on the screen. 



“What 're you doing, McKie?” 

“Determining how I will proceed 
with this case.” 

“You will proceed as a Legum of 
the Gowachin Bar.” 

“Precisely." 

McKie waited. 

The Gowachin peered narrowly at 
him from the screen. 

“Jedrik?” 

“You arc speaking to Jorj X. 
McKie, a Legum of the Gowachin 
Bar.” 

Belatedly, the older Gowachin 
saw something of the way the 
Dosadi experience had changed 
McKie. 

“Do you wish me to place you in 
contact with Aritch?” 

McKie shook his head. They 
were so damned obvious, these un- 
derlings. 

“Aritch didn’t make the Dosadi 
decision. Aritch was chosen to take 
the blow if it came to that. I will 
accept nothing less than the one 
who made that ultimate decision 
which launched the Dosadi experi- 
ment.” 

The Gowachin stared at him 
coldly, then: 

“One moment, I will see what I 
can do.” 

The screen went blank, but the 
audio remained. McKie heard the 
voices. 

“Hello . .Yes, I’m sorry to 
interrupt at this time.” 

“What is it?” 

That was a deep and arrogant 
Gowachin voice, full of annoyance 



74 



GALAXY 



at the interruption. It was also an 
accent which a Dosadi could recog- 
nize in spite of the carefully over- 
laid masking tones. Here was one 
who’d used Dosadi. 

The voice of the older Gowachin 
from McKie’s screen continued: 

“The Legum bound to Aritch has 
come up with a sensitive line of 
questioning. He wishes to speak to 
you.” 

“To me? But I am preparing for 
Laupuk. ’ ’ 

MeKje had no idea what Laupuk 
might be, but it opened a new win- 
dow on the Gowachin for him. Here 
was a glimpse of the rarified strata 
which had been concealed from him 
all of those years. This tiny glimpse 
confirmed him in the course he'd 
chosen. 

“He is listening to us at this 
time.” 

“Listening . why?” 

The tone carried threats, but the 
Gowachin who’d intercepted McKic's 
demands went on unwavering: 

"To save explanations. It's clear 
that he’ll accept nothing less than 
speaking to you. This caller is 
McKie, but . .” 

“Yes?” 

“You will understand.” 

“I presume you have interpreted 
things correctly. Very well. Put him 
on.” 

McKie’s screen flickered, re- 
vealed a wide view of a Gowachin 
room such as he’d never before 
seen. A far wall held spears and 
cutting weapons, streamers of color- 



ful pennants, glistening rocks, or- 
nate carvings in a shiny black sub- 
stance. All of this was backdrop for 
a semi-reclining chairdog occupied 
by an aged Gowachin who sat 
spraddle -legged being annointed by 
two younger Gowachin males. The 
attendants poured a thick, golden 
substance onto the aged Gowachin 
from green crystal flasks. The flasks 
were of a spiral design. The con- 
tents were gently massaged into the 
Gowachin’s skin. The old 
Gowachin glistened with the stuff 
and, when he blinked — no phylum 
tatoos. 

“As you can see,” he said, “I’m 
being prepared for . 

He broke off, recognizing that he 
spoke to a non-Gowachin. Cer- 
tainly, he’d known this. It was a 
slow reaction for a Dosadi. 

“This is a mistake,” he said. 
“Indeed.” McKie nodded pleas- 
antly. “Your name?” 

The old Gowachin scowled at this 
gaucherie, then chuckled. 

“lam called Mrreg.” 

As McKie had suspected. And 
why would a Tandaloor Gowachin 
assume the name, no, the title of 
the mythical monster who’d imbued 
the frog people with a drive toward 
savage testing? The implications 
went far beyond (his planet, colored 
Dosadi. 

“You made the decision for the 
Dosadi experiment?” 

“Someone had to make it.” 

That was not a substantive an- 
swer and McKie decided to take it 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



75 



to issue. “You are not doing me 
any favors! I now know what it 
means to be a Legum of the 
Gowachin Bar and I intend to em- 
ploy my powers to their limits.” 

It was as (hough McKie had 
worked some odd magic which 
froze the scene on his screen. The 
two attendants stopped pouring un- 
gent but did not look toward the 
pickup viewer which was recording 
their actions for McKie. As for 
Mrreg, he sat utterly still, his eyes 
fixed unblinking upon McKie. 

McKie waited. 

Presently, Mrreg turned to the at- 
tendant on his left. 

“Please continue. There is little 
time.” 

McKie took (his as (hough spo- 
ken to himself. 

“You’re my client. Why did you 
send a proxy?” 

Mrreg continued to study McKie. 

“I see what Ekris meant.” Then, 
more briskly: “Well, McKie, I fol- 
lowed your career with interest. It 
now appears I did not follow you 
closely enough. Perhaps if we had 
not ...” 

He left the thought incomplete. 

McKie picked up on this. 

“It was inevitable that I escape 
from Dosadi.” 

“Perhaps." 

The attendants finished their 
work, departed, taking the oddly 
shaped crystal flasks with them. 

“Answer my question,” McKie 
said. 

“I am not required to answer 



your question,” Mrreg countered. 

“Then 1 withdraw from this 
case.” 

Mrreg hunched forward in sudden 
alarm. “You cannot! Aritch 
isn’t . .” 

“I have no dealings with Aritch. 
My client is that Gowachin who 
made the Dosadi decision.” 

“You are engaging in strange be- 
havior for a Legum . Yes, bring 
it.” This last was addressed to 
someone offscreen. Another atten- 
dant appeared carrying a white gar- 
ment shaped somewhat like a long 
apron with sleeves. The attendant 
proceeded to put this onto Mrreg, 
who ignored him, concentrating on 
McKie. 

“Do you have any idea what 
you’re doing, McKie?” 

“Preparing to act for my client.” 

“I see. Who told you about 
me?” 

McKie shook his head. 

“Did you really believe me un- 
able to detect your presence or 
interpret the implications of what 
my own senses tell me?” 

McKie saw that (he Gowachin 
failed to see beneath the surface 
taunting. Mrreg turned to the atten- 
dant who was tying a green ribbon 
at (he back of the apron. The old 
Gowachin had to lean forward for 
this. “A little tighter,” he said. 

The attendant reded the ribbon. 

Addressing McKie, Mrreg said: 
“Please forgive the distraction. This 
must proceed at its own pace.” 

McKie absorbed (his, assessed it

Dosadi fashion. He could see the 
makings of an important Gowachin 
ritual here, but it was a new one to 
him. No matter. That could wait. 
He continued speaking, probing this 
Mrreg. 

“When you found your own 
peculiar uses for Dosadi ..." 

“Peculiar? It’s a universal moti- 
vation, McKie, that one tries to re- 
duce the competition.” . 

“Did you assess the price cor- 
rectly, the price you might be asked 
to pay?” 

“Oh, yes. I knew what I might 
have to pay.” 

There was a clear tone of resigna- 
tion in the Gowachin ’s voice, a rare 
tone for his species. McKie hesi- 
tated. The attendant who'd brought 
the apron left the room, never once 
glancing in McKie ’s direction, al- 
though there had to be a screen to 
show whatever Mrreg saw of his 
caller. 

“You wonder why I sent a proxy 
to hire the Legum?” Mrreg asked. 

“Why Aritch?” 

“Because he’s a candidate 
for . .greater responsibilities. You 
know, McKie, you astonish me. 
Undoubtedly you know what 1 
could have done to you for your 
impertinence, yet that doesn't deter 
you.” 

This revealed more than Mneg 
might have intended, but he re- 
mained unaware (or uncaring) of 
what McKie saw. For his part, 
McKie maintained a bland exterior, 
as blank as that of any Dosadi. 



“I have a single purpose,” 
McKie said. “Not even my client 
will sway me from it.” 

“The function of a Legum,” 
Mrreg said. 

The attendant of the white apron 
returned with an unsheathed blade. 
McKie glimpsed a jeweled handle 
and glittering sweep of cutting edge 
about twenty centimeters long. The 
blade curved back upon itself in a 
tight arc at the tip. The attendant, 
his back to McKie, stood 1 facing 
Mrreg. The blade no longer was 
visible. 

Mrreg, his left side partly 
obscured from McKie by the atten- 
dant, leaned to the right and peered 
up at the screen through which he 
watched McKie. 

“You’ve never been apprised of 
the ceremony we call Laupuk. It’s 
very important and we’ve been re- 
miss in leaving this out of your 
education. Laupuk was essential be- 
fore such a . project as Dosadi 
could be set in motion. Try to un- 
derstand this ritual. It will help you 
prepare your case.” 

“What was your Phylum?” 
“That’s no longer important 
but . very well. It was Great 
Awakening. I was High Magister 
for two decades before we made the 
Dosadi decision.” 

“How many Rim bodies have 
you used up?” 

“My final one. That, too, is no 
longer important. Tel! me, McKie, 
when did you suspect Aritch was 
only a proxy?" 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



77 



“When I realized that not all 
Gowachin were bom Gowachin. ’’ 

“But Aritch ...” 

“Ahh, yes: Aritch aspires to 
greater responsibilities.” 

“Yes ... of course. I see. The 
Dosadi decision had to go far be- 
yond a few phylums or a single 
species. There had to be a . .1 be- 
lieve you Humans call it a 'High 
Command.' Yes, that would’ve be- 
come obvious to one as alert as you 
now appear. Your many marriages 
deceived us, 1 think. Was that de- 
liberate?” 

Secure behind his Dosadi mask, 
McKie decided to lie. 

“Yes.” 

“Ahhhhhhhhh.” 

Mrreg seemed to shrivel into 
himself, but rallied. 

“I see. We were made to believe 
you some kind of diletante with 
perverted emotions. It'd be judged a 
flaw which we could exploit. Then 
there’s another High Command and 
we never suspected. ” 

It all came out swiftly, revealing 
the wheels within wheels which 
ruled Mrreg’s view of the ConSen- 
tient universe. McKie marvelled at 
how much more was said than the 
bare words. This one had been a 
long time away from Dosadi and 
had not been bom there . .but 
there were pressures on Mrreg now 
forcing him to the limits of what 
he’d learned on Dosadi. 

McKie did not interrupt. 

“Wc didn’t expect you to pene- 
trate Aritch’ s role, but that was not 

78 



our intent . .as you know. I pre- 
sume ...” 

Whatever Mrreg presumed, he 
decided not to say it, musing aloud 
instead. 

“One might almost believe you 
were born on Dosadi.” 

McKie remained silent, allowing 
the fear in that conjecture to fill 
Mrreg’s consciousness. 

Presently, Mrreg asked: “Do you 
blame all Gowachin?” 

Still, McKie remained silent. 

Mrreg became agitated. 

“We are a government of sorts, 
my High Command. People can be 
induced not to question a govern- 
ment.” 

McKie decided to press this 
nerve. 

“Governments always commit 
their entire populations when the 
demands grow heavy enough. By 
their passive acceptance, these 
populations become accessories to 
whatever is done in their name." 

“You’ve provided free use of 
jumpdoors for the Dosadi?” 

McKie nodded. “The Calebans 
are aware of their obligation. Jedrik 
has been busy instructing her com- 
patriots." 

“You think to loose the Dosadi 
upon the ConSentiency and hunt 
down my High Command? Have a 
care, McKie. I warn you not to 
abandon your duties as a Legum or 
to tum your back on Aritch.” 

McKie continued silent. 

“Don’t make that error, McKie. 
Aritch is your client. Through him 



GALAXY 



you represent all Gowachin.” 

“A Legum requires a responsible 
client,” McKie said. “Not a proxy, 
but a client whose acts are brought 
into question by the case tried.” 

Mneg revealed Gowachin signs 
of deep concern. 

“Hear me, McKie. I haven’t 
much time.” 

In a sudden rush of apprehension, 
McKie focused on the attendant 
with the blade who stood there 
partly obscuring the seated 
Gowachin. Mneg spoke in a swift 
spill of words. 

“By our standards, McKie, you 
are not yet very well educated in 
Gowachin necessities. That was our 
error. And now your . .impetuos- 
ity has put you into a position 
which is about to become untena- 
ble.” 

The attendant shifted slightly, 
arms moving up. McKie glimpsed 
the blade tip at the attendant’s right 
shoulder. 

“Gowachin don’t have families 
as do Humans or even Wreaves,” 
Mneg said. “We have graduated 
advancement into groups which 
hold more and more responsibility 
for those beneath them. This was 
the pattern adopted by our High 
Command. What you see as a 
Gowachin family is only a breeding 
group with its own limited rules. 
With each step up in responsibility 
goes a requirement that we pay an 
increasing price for failure. You ask 
if I know the price? Ahhh, McKie. 
The breeding male Gowachin makes

As he spoke the final word, the 
blade in the attendant's hands 
flashed out and around in a shim- 
mering arc. It caught the seated 
Gowachin at the neck. Mrreg 's 
head, neatly severed, was caught in 
the loop at the blade's tip, lifted 
high, then lowered onto the white 
apron which now was splashed with 
green gore. 

The scene blanked out, was re- 
placed by the Gowachin who had 
connected McKie with Mrreg. 

“Aritch wishes to consult his 
Legum," the Gowachin said.

— INSIGHTS (a glimpse of eorly 
Human philosophy), BuSab Text 



Jedrik made contact with McKie 
while he waited for the arrival of 
Aritch and Ceylang. He had been 
staring absently at the ceiling, 
evaluating in a profoundly Dosadi 



way how to gain personal advantage 
from the upcoming encounter with 
them, when he felt the touch of her 
mind on his. 

McKie locked himsell nis 
body. 

“No transfer.” 

“Of course not.” 

It was a tiny thing, a subtle shad- 
ing in the contact which could have 
been overlooked by anyone with a 
less accurate simulation model of 
Jedrik. 

“You’re angry with me,” McKie 
said. 

He projected irony, knew she’d 
read this correctly. 

When she responded, her anger 
had been reduced to irritation. The 
point was not the shading of emo- 
tion, it was that she allowed such 
emotion to reveal itself. 

“You remind me of one of my 
early lovers,” she said. 

McKie thought of where Jedrik 
was at this moment — safely rocked 
in the flower-perfumed air of his 
floating island on the planetary sea 
of Tutalsee. How strange such an 
environment must be for a Dosadi 
. .no threats, fruit which could 
be picked and eaten without a 
thought of poisons. The memories 
she'd taken from him could coat the 
island with familiarity, but her flesh 
would continue to find that a 
strange experience. His memories 
— yes. The island would remind 
her of all those wives he’d taken 
to the honeymoon bowers of that 
place. 



GALAXY 



McKie spoke from this aware- 
ness. 

“No doubt that early lover failed 
to show sufficient appreciation of 
your abilities outside the bed- 

room, that is. Which one was 

And he named several accurate 
possibilities, lifting them from the 
memories he’d taken from Jedrik. 

Now, she laughed. He sensed the 
untainted response, real humor and 
unchecked. 

McKie was reminded in his turn 
of one of his early wives, and this 
made him think of the breeding 
situation from which Jedrik had 
come — no confusions between a 
choice for breeding mate and a 
lover taken for the available enjoy- 
ment of sex. One might even ac- 
tively dislike the breeding mate. 

Lovers . .wives . What was 
the difference except for the socially 
imprinted conventions out of which 
the roles arose? But Jedrik did re- 
mind him of that one particular 
woman and he explored his memo- 
ry, wondering if it might help him 
now in his relationship with Jedrik. 
He'd been in his mid -thirties and 
assigned to one of his first personal 
BuSab cases, sent out with no old- 
timer to monitor and instruct him. 
The youngest Human agent in the 
Bureau’s history ever to be released 
on his own, so it was rumored. The 
planet had been one of the Ylir 
group, very much unlike anything 
in McKie’ s previous experience: an 
ingrown place with deep entry ways 



in all of the houses and an oppres- 
sive silence all around. No animals, 
no birds, no insects . .just that 
awesome Silence within which a 
fanatic religion was reported form- 
ing. All conversations were low- 
voiced and full of subtle intonations 
which suggested an inner communi- 
cation peculiar to Ylir and somehow 
making sport with all outsiders not 
privy to their private code. Very 
like Dosadi in this. 

His wife of the moment, safely 
ensconced on Tutalsee, had been 
quite the opposite: gregarious, spor- 
tive, noisy. 

Something about that Ylir case 
had sent McKie back to this wife 
with a sharpened awareness of her 
needs. The marriage had gone well 
for a long time, longer than any of 
the others. And he saw now why 
Jedrik reminded him of that one: 
they both protected themselves with 
a tough armor of femininity, but 
were extremely vulnerable behind 
that facade. When the armor col- 
lapsed, it collapsed totally. This re- 
alization puzzled McKie because he 
read his own reaction clearly: he 
was frightened. 

In the eyeblink this evaluation 
took, Jedrik read him: 

“We have not left Dosadi. We’ve 
taken it with us.” 

So that was why she’d made this 
contact, to be certain he mixed this 
datum into his evaluations. McKie 
looked out the open window. It 
would be dusk soon here on Tan- 
daloor. The Gowachin home planet 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT

was a place which had defied 
change for thousands of standard 
years. In some respects, it was a 
backwater. 

The ConSemiency will never be 
the same. 

The tiny trickle of Dosadi which 
Aritch’s people had hoped to cut off 
was now a roaring cataract. The 
people of Dosadi would insinuate 
themselves into niche after niche of 
ConSentient civilization. What 
could resist even the lowliest 
Dosadi? Laws would change. Rela- 
tionships would assume profound 
and subtle differences. Everything 
from die most casual friendship to 
the most complex business relation- 
ship would take on some Dosadi 
character. 

McKie recalled Aritch’s parting 
question as they’d sent him to the 
jumpdoor which would put him on 
Dosadi. 

“Ask yourself if there might be a 
price too high to pay for the Dosadi 
lesson.’’ 

That had been McKie’ s first clue 
to Aritch's actual motives and the 
word lesson had bothered him, but 
he’d missed the implications. With 
some embarrassment, McKie re- 
called his glib answer to Aritch’s 
question: 

“It depends on the lesson.’’ 

True, but how blind he’d been to 
things any Dosadi would have seen. 
How ignorant. Now, he indicated to 
Jedrik that he understood why she’d 
called such things to his attention. 

“Aritch didn’t look much beyond 



the uses of outrage and injus- 
tice . .” 

“And how to turn such things to 
personal advantage.’’ 

She was right, of course. McKie 
stared out at the gathering dusk. 
Yes, the species tried to make 
everything its own. If the species 
failed, then forces beyond it moved 
in, and so on, ad infinitum. 

I do what l do. 

He recalled those words with a 
shudder, felt Jedrik recoil. But she 
was proof even against this. 

“What powers your ConSen- 
tiency had.” 

Past tense, right. And not our 
ConSentiency because that already 
was a thing of the past. Besides 
... she was Dosadi. 

“And the illusions of power,” 
she said. 

He saw at last what she was em- 
phasizing and her own shared 
memories in his mind made the les- 
son doubly impressive. She’d 
known precisely what McKie ’s per- 
sonal ego-focus might overlook. 
Yet, this was one of the glues 
which held the Conscntiency to- 
gether. 

“Who can imagine himself im- 
mune from any retaliation?” he 
quoted. 

It was right out of the BuSab 
Manual. 

. Jedrik made no response. 

McKie needed no more emphasis 
from her now. The lesson of history 
was clear. Violence bred violence. 
If this violence got out of hand, it 



GALAXY 



ran a course depressing in its repeti- 
tive pattern. More often than not, 
that course was deadly to the inno- 
cent, the so-called ‘enlistment 
phase. ’ The ex -innocents ignited more 
violence and more violence until 
either reason prevailed or all was 
destroyed. There was a sufficient 
number of cinder blocks which once 
had been planets to make the lesson 
clear. Dosadi had come within a 
hair of joining that uninhabited, un- 
inhabitable list. 

Before breaking contact, Jedrik 
had another point to make. 

“You recall that in those final 
days, Broey increased the rations 
for his Human auxiliaries, his way 
of saying to them: ‘You'll be turned 
out onto the Rim soon to fend for 
yourselves.” 

“A Dosadi way of saying that.” 

"Correct. We always held that 
thought in reserve: That we should 
breed in such numbers that some 
would survive no matter what hap- 
pened. We would thus begin pro- 
ducing species which could sur- 
vive there without the city of 
Chu ... or any other city designed 
solely to produce non -poisonous 
foods.” 

“But there’s always a bigger 
force waiting in the wings.” 

"Make sure Aritch understands 
that.” 



Choose containable violence when vio- 
lence cannot be avoided. Better this 



than epidemic violence. 

— Lessons of Choice, 
The BuSab Manual 



The senior attendant of the Court- 
arena, a squat and dignified 
Gowachin of the Assumptive 
Phylum, confronted McKie at the 
arena door with a confession: 

“I have delayed informing you 
that some of your witnesses have 
been excluded by Prosecution chal- 
lenge.” 

The attendant, whose name was 
Darak, gave a Gowachin shrug, 
waited. 

McKie glanced beyond the atten- 
dant at the truncated oval of the 
arena entrance which framed a 
lower section of the audience seats. 
The seats were filled. He had ex- 
pected some such challenge for the 
first morning session of (he trial, 
saw Darak’s words as a vital revela- 
tion. They were accepting his gam- 
bit. Darak had signalled -a risky line 
of attack by those who guided 
Ceylang’s performance. They ex- 
pected McKie to protest. He 
glanced back at Aritch who stood 
quietly submissive three steps be- 
hind his Legum. Aritch gave every 
appearance of having resigned him- 
self to the arena’s conditions. 

‘ 'The forms must be obeyed. 

Beneath that appearance lay the 
hoary traditions of Gowachin 
Law — The guilty are innocent. 
Governments always do evil. 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



83 



Legalists put their own interests 
first. Defense and prosecution are 
brother and sister . Suspect 
everything. 

Aritch ’$ Legum controlled the ini- 
tial posture and McKie had chosen 
defense. It hadn’t surprised him to 
be told that Ceylang would prose- 
cute. McKie had countered by in- 
sisting that Broey sit on a judicial 
panel which would be limited to 
three members. This had caused a 
delay during which Bildoon had 
called McKie, probing for any be- 
trayal. Bildoon '$ approach had been 
so obvious that McKie had at first 
suspected a feint within a feint. 

“McKie, the Gowachin fear that 
you have a Caleban at your com- 
mand. That’s a force which 
they ...” 

“The more they fear the better.” 

McKie had stared back at the 
screen-framed face of Bildoon, ob- 
serving the signs of strain. Jedrik 
was right: the non-Dosadi were very 
easy to read. 

“But I’m told you left this 
Dosadi in spite of a Caleban con- 
tract which prohibited ...” 

“Let them wony. Good for 
them.” 

McKie watched Bildoon intently 
without betraying a single emotion. 
No doubt there were others monitor- 
ing this exchange. Let them begin 
to see what they faced. Puppet Bil- 
doon was not about to uncover what 
those shadowy forces wanted. They 
had Bildoon here on Tandaloor, 
though, and this told McKie an es- 



sential fact. The PanSpechi chief of 
BuSab was being offered as bait. 
This was precisely the response 
McKie sought. 

Bildoon had ended the call with- 
out achieving his purpose. McKie 
had nibbled only enough to insure 
that Bildoon would be offered again 
as a bait. And the puppet masters 
still feared that McKie had a Cale- 
ban at his beck and call. 

No doubt the puppet masters had 
tried to question their God Wall 
Caleban. McKie hid a smile, think- 
ing how that conversation must 
have gone. The Caleban had only to 
quote the letter of the contract and 
if the questioners became accusatory 
the Caleban would respond with 
anger, ending the exchange. And 
the Caleban ’s words would be so 
filled with terms subject to ambigu- 
ous translation that the puppet mas- 
ters would never be certain of what 
they heard. 

As he stared at the patiently wait- 
ing Darak, McKie saw that they had 
a problem, those shadowy figures 
behind Aritch. Laupuk had removed 
Mrreg from their councils and his 
advice would have been valuable 
now. McKie had deduced that the 
correct reference was “The Mrreg” 
and that Aritch headed the list of 
possible successors. Aritch might be 
Dosadi-trained, but he was not 
Dosadi -bom. There was a lesson in 
. this that the entire ConSentiency 
would soon team. 

And Broey as a judge in this case 
remained an unchangeable fact. 



84 



GALAXY 



Broey was Dosadi-bom. The Cale- 
ban contract had kept Broey on his 
poison planet but it had not limited 
him to a Gowachin body, Broey 
knew what it was to be both Human 
and Gowachin. Broey knew about 
the Pcharkys and their use by those 
who'd held Dosadi in bondage. And 
Broey was now Gowachin. The 
forces opposing McKie dared not 
name another Gowachin judge. 
They must choose from the other 
species. They had an interesting 
quandry. And without a Caleban as- 
sistant, there were no more Pchar- 
kys to be had on Dosadi. The most 
valuable coin the puppet masters 
had to offer was lost to them. 
They’d be desperate. Some of the 
older ones would be very desperate. 

Footsteps sounded around the 
tum of the corridor behind Aritch. 
McKie glanced back, saw Ccylang 
come into view with her attendants. 
McKie counted no less than twenty 
leading Legums around her. They 
were out in force. Not only 
Gowachin pride and integrity but 
their sacred view of Law stood at 
issue. And the desperate ones stood 
behind them, goading. McKie could 
almost see those shadowy figures in 
the shape of this entourage. 

Ceylang, he saw, wore the black 
robes and white-striped hood of 
Leg urn Prosecutor, but she'd thrown 
back the hood to free her mandi- 
bles. McKie detected tension in her 
movements. 

She gave no sign of recognition 
but McKie saw her through Dosadi 



eyes. 

/ frighten her. And she’s right. 

Turning to address the waiting at- 
tendant and speaking loudly to 
make sure that the approaching 
group heard, McKie said: 

“Every law must be tested. I ac- 
cept that you* have given me formal 
announcement of a limit on my de- 
fense.” 

Darak, expecting outraged protest 
and a demand for a list of the 
excluded witnesses, showed obvious 
confusion. 

‘ ‘Formal an nouncement? ’ ' 

Ceylang and entourage came to a 
stop behind Aritch. 

McKie went on in the same loud 
voice: 

“We stand here within the sphere 
of the Courtarena. All matters con- 
cerning a dispute in the arena arc 
formal in this place.” 

The attendant glanced at Ceylang, 
seeking help. This response 
threatened him. Darak, hoping 
someday to be a High Magister, 
should now be recognizing his in- 
adequacies. He would never make it 
in the politics of the Gowachin 
Phyla, especially not in the coming 
Dosadi age. 

McKie explained as though to a 
neophyte: 

“Information to be verified by 
my witnesses is known to me in its 
entirety. I will present the evidence 
myself.” 

Ceylang, having stooped to hear 
a low- voiced comment from one of 
her Gowachin advisors, showed 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



85 



surprise at this. She raised one of 
her ropey tendrils, called: “I pro- 
test. The Defense Legum cannot 
give ...” 

“How can you protest?” McKie 
interrupted. “We stand here before 
no judicial panel empowered to rule 
on any protest.” 

“I make formal protest!” 
Ceylang insisted, ignoring an ad- 
visor on her right who was tugging 
at her sleeve. 

McKie permitted himself a cold 
smile. 

“Very well. Then we must call 
Darak into the arena as witness, he 
being the only party present who is 
outside our dispute.” 

The edges of Aritch’s jaws came 
down in a Gowachin grimace. 

“At the end, I wanted them not 
to go with the Wreave,” he said. 
"They cannot say they came here 
unwarned.” 

Too late, Ceylang saw what had 
happened. McKie would be able to 
question Darak on the challenges to 
the witnesses. Some of those chal- 
lenges were certain to be over- 
turned. At the very least, McKie 
would know who the Prosecution 
feared. He would know it in time to 
act upon it. There would be no de- 
lays valuable to Prosecution. Ten- 
sion, fear and pride had made 
Ceylang act precipitately. Aritch 
had been right to warn them but 
they counted on McKie' $ fear of the 
interlocked Wreave triads. Let them 
count. Let them blunt their aware- 
ness on that and on a useless con- 



cern over the excluded witnesses. 

McKie motioned Darak through 
the doorway into the arena, heard 
him utter an oath. The reason be- 
came apparent as McKie pressed 
through in the crowded surge of the 
Prosecutor’s party. The instruments 
of Truth -by-Pain had been arrayed 
on their ancient rack below the 
judges. Seldom brought out of their 
wrappings even for display to visit- 
ing dignitaries these days, the in- 
struments had not been employed in 
the arena within the memory of a 
living witness. McKie had expected 
this display. It was obvious that 
Darak and Ceylang had not. It was 
interesting to note the members of 
Ceylang’s entourage who were 
watching for McKie ’s response. 

He gave them a grin of satisfac- 
tion. 

McKie turned his attention to the 
judicial panel. They had given him 
Broey. The ConSentiency, acting 
through BuSab, held the right of 
one appointment. Their choice de- 
lighted McKie. Bait, indeed! Bil- 
doon occupied the seat on Broey ’s 
right. The PanSpechi chief of 
bureau sat there all bland and re- 
served in his unfamiliar Gowachin 
robes of water green. Bildoon’s fa- 
ceted eyes glittered in the harsh 
arena lighting. The third judge had 
to be the Gowachin choice undoubt- 
edly maneuvered (as Bildoon had 
been) by the puppet masters. It was 
a Human and McKie, recognizing 
him, missed a step, recovered his 
balance with a visible effort. 



GALAXY 



What were they doing? 

The third judge was named 
Mordes Parando, a noted challenger 
of BuSab actions. He wanted BuSab 
eliminated — either outright or by 
removing some, of the bureau's key 
powers. He came from the planet 
Lirat, which provided McKie with 
no surprises. Lirat was a natural 
cover for the shadowy forces. It 
was a place of enormous wealth and 
great private estates guarded by 
their own security forces. Parando 
was a man of somewhat superficial 
manners which might conceal a 
genuine sophisticate, knowledgeable 
and erudite, or a completely ruthless 
autocrat of Brocy's stamp. He was 
certainly Dosadi-trained. And his 
features bore the look of the Dosadi 
Rim. 

There was one more fact about 
Parando which no one outside Lirat 
was supposed to know. McKie had 
come upon it quite by chance while 
investigating a Palenki who’d been 
an estate guard on Lirat. The turtle- 
like Palenki were notoriously dull, 
employed chiefly as muscle. This 
one had been uncommonly obser- 
vant. 

“Parando makes advice on 
Gowachin Law.” 

This had been responsive to a 
question about Parando 's relation- 
ship with the estate guard being in- 
vestigated. McKie, not seeing a 
connection between question and 
answer, had not pursued the matter 
but had tucked this datum away for 
future investigation. He had been 



mildly interested at the time because 
of the rumored existence of a 
legalist enclave on Lirat and such 
enclaves had been known to test the 
limits of legality. 

The people behind Aritch would 
expect McKie to recognize Parando. 
Would they expect Parando to be 
recognized as a legalist? They were 
certain to know the danger of put- 
ting Parando on a Gowachin bench. 
Professional legalists were abso- 
lutely prohibited from Gowachin 
judicial service. 

"Let the people judge." 

Why would they need a legalist 
here? Or were they expecting 
McKie to recognize the Rim origins 
of Parando' s body? Were they 
warning McKie not to raise that 
issue here? Body exchange and the 
implications of immortality rep- 
resented a box of snakes no one 
wanted to open. And the possibility 
of one species spying on 
another . There was fragmenta- 
tion of the ConSentiency latent in 
this case. More ways than one. 

If I challenge Parando, his re- 
placement may be more dangerous. 
If I expose him as a legalist after 
the trial starts . , . Could they ex- 
pect me to do that? Let us explore 

Knowing he was watched by 
countless eyes, McKie swept his 
gaze around the arena. Above the 
soft green absorbent oval where he 
stood were rank on rank of benches, 
every seat occupied. Muted morning 
light from the domed transluscent 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



87 



ceiling illuminated rows of Humans, 
Gowachin, Palenki, Sobarips . 
McKie identified a cluster of ferret 
Wreaves just above the arena, 
limber thin with a sinuous flexing in 
every movement. They would bear 
watching. But every species and 
faction in the ConSentiency would 
be represented here. Those who 
could not come in person would 
watch these proceedings via the glit- 
tering transmitter eyes which looked 
down from the ceiling’s edges. 

Now, McKie looked to the right 
at the witness pen set into the wall 
beneath the ranked benches. He 
identified every witness he’d called, 
even the challenged ones. The 
forms were being obeyed. While the 
ConSentient Covenant required cer- 
tain modifications here, this arena 
was still dominated by Gowachin 
Law. To accent that, the blue metal 
box from the Running Phylum oc- 
cupied the honor place on the bench 
in front of the judicial panel. 

Who will taste the knife here? 

Protocol demanded that Pro- 
secutor and Defense approach to a 
point beneath the judges, abase 
themselves and calf out acceptance 
of the arena’s conditions. The Pro- 
secutor’s party, however, was in 
disarray. Two of Ceylang’s advisors 
were whispering excited advice to 
her. 

The members of the judicial 
panel conferred, glancing at the 
scene below them. They could not 
act formally until the obeisance. 

McKic passed a glance across the 



panel, absorbed Broey’s posture. 
The Dosadi Gowachin ’$ enlightened 
greed was like an anchor point. It 
was like Gowachin Law, change- 
able only on the surface. And Brocy 
was but the tip of the Dosadi advis- 
ory group which Jedrik had ap- 
proved. 

Holding his arms extended to the 
sides, McKie marched forward, 
abased himself face down on the 
floor, stood and called out: 

“I accept this arena as my friend. 
The conditions here are my condi- 
tions but Prosecution has defiled the 
sacred traditions of this place. Does 
the court give me leave to slay her 
outright?” 

There was an exclamation behind 
him, the sound of running, the sud- 
den flopping of a body onto the 
arena’s matted floor. Ceylang could 
not address the court before this 
obeisance and she knew it. She and 
the others now also knew something 
else just as important — that McKie 
was ready to slay her despite the 
threat of Wreave vendetta. 

In a breathless voice, Ceylang 
called out her acceptance of the 
arena’s conditions, then: 

‘T protest this trick by Defense 
Legum!” 

McKie saw the stirring of 
Gowachin in the audience. A trick? 
Didn’t Ceylang know yet how the 
Gowachin dearly loved legal tricks? 

The members of the judicial 
panel had been thoroughly briefed 
on the surface demands of the 
Gowachin forms, though it was 



GALAXY 



doubtful that Bildoon understood 
sufficiently what went on beneath 
those forms. The PanSpechi con- 
firmed this now by leaning forward 
to speak. 

“Why does the senior attendant 
of this court enter ahead of the 
Legums?’ ’ 

McKie detected a fleeting smile 
on Broey’s face, glanced back to 
see Darak standing apart from the 
prosecution throng, alone and 
trembling. 

McKie took one step forward. 

“Will the court direct Darak to 
the witness pen? He is here because 
of a formal demand by the Pro- 
secutor.” 

“This is the senior attendant of 
your Court,” Ceylang argued. “He 
guards the door to . 

“Prosecution made formal protest 
to a matter which occurred in the 
presence of this attendant," McKie 

said. “As an attendant, Darak 

stands outside the conflicting inter- 
ests. He is the only reliable wit- 

Broey stirred, looked at Ceylang, 
and McKie realized how strange the 
Wreave must appear to a Dosadi. 
This did not deter Broey, however. 

“Did you protest?” 

It was a direct question from the 
bench. Ceylang was required to an- 
swer. She looked to Bildoon for 

help but he remained silent. 

Parando also refused to help her. 
She glanced at Darak. The terrified 
attendant could not take his atten- 
tion from the instruments of pain. 



Perhaps he knew something specific 
about their presence in the arena. 

Ceylang tried to explain. 

“When Defense Legum suggest- 
ed an illegal ..." 

“Did you protest?" 

“But the . 

“This court decides on all mat- 
ters of legality. Did you protest?” 

“I did.” 

It was forced out of her. A fit of 
trembling passed over the slender 
Wreave form. 

Broey waved Darak to the wit- 
ness pen, had to add a vocal order 
when the frightened attendant failed 
to understand. Darak almost ran to 
the shelter of the pen. 

Silence pervaded the arena. The 
silence of the audience was an ex- 
plosive thing. They sat poised in the 
watching ovals, all of those species 
and factions with their special fears. 
By now, they'd heard many stories 
and rumors. Jumpdoors had spread 
the Dosadi emigres all across the 
ConSentiency. Media representa- 
tives had been excluded from 
Dosadi and this court on the 
Gowachin argument that they were 
"prey to uninformed subjective 
reactions,” but they would be 
watching here through the transmit- 
ter eyes at the ceiling. 

McKie looked around at nothing 
in particular but took in every de- 
tail. There were more than three 
judges in this arena and Ceylang 
certainly must realize that. 
Gowachin Law turned upon itself, 
existing “only to be changed.” But 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



89 



that watching multitude was quite 
another matter. Ceylang must be 
made to understand that she was a 
sacrifice of the arena. Consentient 
opinion stood over her like a heavy 
sledge ready to smash down. 

■It was Parando’s tum. 

“Will opposing Legums make 
their opening arguments now?” 

‘‘We can’t proceed while a for- 
mal protest is undecided,” McKic 
said. 

Parando understood. He glanced 
at the audience, at the ceiling. His 
actions were a direct signal: 
Parando knew which judges really 
decided here. To emphasize it, he 
ran a hand from the front of his 
neck down his chest, the unique 
Rim Raiders' salute from Dosadi 
signifying ‘Death before surrender.’ 
Subtle hints in the movement gave 
McKie another datum: Parando was 
a Gowaehin in a Human body. 
They’d dared put two Gowaehin on 
that panel! 

With Dosadi insight, McKie saw 
why they did this. They were pre- 
pared to produce the Caleban con- 
tract here. They were telling McKie 
that they would expose the body- 
exchange secret if he forced them to 
it. All would sec that loophole in 
the Caleban contract which confined 
the Dosadi -bom but released outsid- 
ers in Dosadi flesh. 

They think I am really Jedrik in 
this flesh! 

Parando revealed even more. His 
people intended to find the Jedrik 
body and kill it, leaving this McKie 

90 



flesh forever in doubt. He could 
protest his McKie identity all he 
wanted. They had but to demand 
that he prove it. Without the other 
person . What had their God 
Wall Caleban told them? 

“He is McKie, she is McKie. He 
is Jedrik, she is Jedrik.” 

His mind in turmoil, McKie 
wondered if he dared risk an im- 
mediate mind contact with Jedrik. 
Together, they’d already recognized 
this danger. Jedrik had hidden her- 
self on McKie's hideaway, a float- 
ing island on Tutalsee. She was 
there with a special Taprisiot con- 
tract prohibiting unwanted calls 
which might inadvertently reveal 
her location. 

The judges, led by Parando, were 
acting, however, moving for an 
immediate examination of Darak. 
McKie forced himself to perform as 
a Legum. 

His career in ruins, the attendant 
answered like an automaton. In the 
end, McKie restored most of his 
witnesses. There were two notable 
exceptions: Grinik (that flawed 
thread which might have led to The 
Mrreg) and Stiggy. McKie was not 
certain why they wanted to exclude 
the Dosadi weapons genius who’d 
transformed a BuSab wallet’s con- 
tents into instruments of victory. 
Was it that Stiggy had broken an 
unbreakable code? That made sense 
only if Prosecution intended to play 
down the inherent Dosadi superior- 
ity. 

Still uncertain, McKie prepared 
GALAXY 



to retire and seek a way to avoid 
Parando’s gambit but Ceylang ad- 
dressed the bench. 

“The issue of witnesses having 
been introduced by Defense," she 
said. “Prosecution wishes to 
explore this issue. We note many 
witnesses from Dosadi called by 
Defense. There is a noteworthy 
omission whose name has not yet 
been introduced here. I refer to a 
Human by the name of Jedrik. Pro- 
secution wishes to call Keila Jedrik 
as . 

“One moment!” 

McKie searched his mind for the 
forms of an acceptable escape. He 
knew that his blurted protest had 
revealed more than he wanted. But 
they were moving faster than he’d 
expected. Prosecution did not really 
want Jedrik as a witness, not in a 
Gowachin Courtarena where the 
roles were never quite what they 
appeared to non-Gowachin. This 
was a plain message to McKic. 

"We're going to find her and kill 
her." 

With Bildoon and Parando con- 
curring, a jumpdoor was summoned 
and Ceylang played her trump. 

“Defense knows the whereabouts 
of witness Keila Jedrik.” 

They were forcing the question, 
aware of the emotional bond be- 
tween McKic and Jedrik. He had a 
choice: argue that a personal rela- 
tionship with the witness excluded 
her. But Prosecution and all the 
judges had to concur. They ob- 
viously would not do this . not 



yet. A harsh lock on his emotions, 
McKie gave the jumpdoor instruc- 
tions. 

Presently, Jedrik stepped onto the 
arena floor, faced the judges. She’d 
been into the wardrobe at his bower 
cottage and wore a yellow and 
orange sarong which emphasized 
her height and grace. Open brown 
sandals protected her feet. There 
was a flame red blossom at her left 
ear. She managed to look exotic 
and fragile. 

Broey spoke for the judges. 

“Do you have knowledge of the 
issues at trial here?” 

“What issues are at trial?” 

She asked it with a childlike in- 
nocence which did not even fool 
Bildoon. They were forced to ex- 
plain, however, because of those 
other judges to whom every nuance 
here was vital. She heard them out 
in silence. 

“An alleged experiment on a sen- 
tient population confined to a planet 
called Dosadi . lack of informed 
consent by subject population 
charged . accusations of conspi- 
racy against certain Gowachin and 
others not yet named ...” 

Two fingers pressed to his eyes 
in the guise of intense listening, 
McKie made contact with Jedrik, 
suggesting, conferring. They had to 
find a way out of this trap! When 
he looked up, he saw the suspicions 
in Parando’s face: Which body, 
which ego? McKie? Jedrik? 

In the end, Ceylang hammered 
home the private message, demand - 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



VI 



ing whether Jedrik had “any per- 
sonal relationship with Defense 
Legum?” 

Jedrik answered in a decidedly 
un-Dosadi fashion. 

“Why . yes. We are lovers.” 

In itself, this was not enough to 
exclude her from the arena unless 
Prosecution and (he entire judicial 
panel agreed. Ceylang proposed the 
exclusion. Bildoon and Parando 
were predictable in their agreement. 
McKie waited for Broey. 

“Agreed.” 

Broey had a private compact with 
the shadow forces then. Jedrik and 
McKie had expected this but had 
not anticipated the form confirma- 
tion would take. 

McKie asked for a recess until 
the following morning. 

With the most benign face on it, 
this was granted. Broey announced 
the decision, smiling down at Jed- 
rik. It was a measure of McKie ’s 
Dosadi conditioning that he could 
not find it in himself to blame 
Broey for wanting personal victory 
over the person who had beaten him 
on Dosadi. 

Back in his quarters, Jedrik put a 
hand on McKie’ s chest, spoke with 
eyes lowered. 

“Don't blame yourself, McKie. 
This was inevitable. Those judges, 
none of them, would’ve allowed 
any protest from you before seeing 
me in person on that arena floor.” 

“I know.” 

She looked up at him, smiling. 

“Yes ... of course. How like 



one person we are.” 

For a time after that, (hey re- 
viewed the assessment of the aides 
chosen for Broey. Shared memories 
etched away at minutae. Could any 
choice be improved? Not one per- 
son was changed — Human or 
Gowachin. Ail of (hose advisors 
and aides were Dosadi-born. They 
could be depended upon to be loyal 
to their origins, to their condition- 
ing, to themselves individually. For 
the task assigned to them, they were 
the best available. 

McKie brought it to a close. 

“I can’t leave the immediate area 
of the arena until the trial’s over.” 

She knew that, but it needed say- 
ing. 

There was a small cell adjoining 
his office, a bedog there, communi- 
cations instruments, Human toilet 
facilities. They delayed going into 
the bedroom, turned to a low-key 
argument over the advisability of a 
body exchange. It was procrastina- 
tion on both sides, outcome known 
in advance. Familiar flesh was fam- 
iliar flesh, less distracting. It gave 
each of them an edge which they 
dared not sacrifice. McKie could 
play Jedrik and Jedrik could play 
McKie, but that would be danger- 
ous play now. 

When they retired, it was to 
make love, the most tender experi- 
ence either had known. There was 
no submission, only a giving, shar- 
ing, an open exchange which tight- 
ened McKie ’s throat with joy and 
fear, sent Jedrik into a fit of un- 



92 



GALAXY 



Dosadi sobbing. 

When she’d recovered, she turned 
to him on the bed, touched his right 
check with a finger. 

“McKie.” 

“Yes?” 

“I’ve never had to say this to 
another person, but ...” She si- 
Ienced his attempted interruption by 
punching his shoulder, leaning up 
on an elbow to look down at him. It 
reminded McKie of their first night 
together and he saw that she had 
gone back into her Dosadi 
shell . but there was something 
else, a difference in the eyes. 

“What is it?” 

“Just that I love you. It’s a very 
interesting feeling, especially when 
you can admit it openly. How 
odd.” 

“Stay here with me.” 

“We both know I can’t. There’s 
no safe place here for either of 
us . but the one who ...” 
“Then let’s . 

“We’ve already decided against 
an exchange.” 

"Where will you go?” 

“Best you don't know.” 

“If . .” 

“No! I wouldn’t be safe as a 
witness; I’m not even safe at your 
side. We both ...” 

“Don’t go back to Dosadi.” 
“Where is Dosadi? It’s the only 
place where I could ever feel at 
home, but Dosadi no longer ex- 
ists.” 

“I meant ...” 

“I know.” 



She sat up, hugged her knees, re- 
vealing the sinewy muscles of her 
shoulders and back. McKie studied 
her, trying to fathom what it was 
she hid in that Dosadi shell. Despite 
the intimacy of their shared 
memories, something about her 
eluded him. It was as though he di- 
dn't want to leant this thing. She 
would flee and hide, of course, 
but ... He listened carefully as she 
began to speak in a far away voice. 

“It’d be interesting to go back to 
Dosadi someday. The differenc- 
es . .” 

She looked over her shoulder at 
him. 

“There are those who fear we’ll 
make over the ConSentiency in 
Dosadi’s image. We’ll try, but the 
result won’t be Dosadi. We’ll take 
what we judge to be valuable, but 
that’ll change Dosadi more than it 
changes you. Your masses arc less 
aleil, slower, less resourceful, but 
you’re so numerous. In the end, the 
ConSentiency will win, but it’ll no 
longer be the ConSentiency. I won- 
der what it’ll be when ...” 

She laughed at her own musing, 
shook her head. 

“And there’s Broey. They’ll have 
to deal with Broey and the team 
we’ve given him. Broey Plus! Your 
ConSentiency hasn’t the faintest 
grasp of what we’ve loosed among, 
them.” 

“The predator in the flock.” 

“To Broey, your people are like 
the Rim — a natural resource.” 

“But he has no Pcharkys.” 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



93 



“Not yet.” 

“I doubt if the Calebans ever 
again will participate in . 

“There may be other ways. Look 
how easy it is for us.” 

“But we were printed upon each 
other by . .” 

“Exactly! And they continue to 
suspect that you’re in my body and 
I’m in yours. Their entire experi- 
ence precludes the free shift back 
and forth, one body to 
another ...” 

“Or this other thing ...” 

He caressed her mind. 

“Yes! Broey won’t suspect until 
too late what’s in store for him. 
They’ll be a long time learning 
there’s no way to sort you 
from . me!” 

This last was an exultant shout as 
she turned and fell upon him. It was 
a wild replay of their first night to- 
gether. McKie abandoned himself to 
it. There was no other choice, no 
time for the mind to dwell on de- 
pressing thoughts. 

In the morning, he had to tap his 
implanted amplifiers to bring his 
awareness to the required pitch for 
the arena. The process took a few 
minutes while he dressed. 

Jedrik moved softly with her own 
preparations, straightened the bedog 
and caressed its resilient surface. 
She summoned a jumpdoor then, 
held him with a lingering kiss. The 
jumpdoor opened behind her as she 
pushed away from him. 

McKie smelled familiar flowers, 
glimpsed the bowers of his Tutalsee 



island before the door blinked out 
of existence, hiding Jedrik and the 
island from him. Tutalsee? The 
moment of shocked understanding 
delayed him. She’d counted on that! 
He recovered, sent his mind leaping 
after her. 

I'll force an exchange! By the 
Gods . 

His mind met pain, consuming, 
blinding pain. It was agony such as 
he’d not even imagined could exist. 

Jedrik ! 

His mind held an unconscious 
Jedrik whose awareness had fled 
from pain. The contact was so deli- 
cate, like holding a newborn infant. 
The slightest relaxation and he 
knew he would lose her to ... He 
felt that terrifying monster of the 
first exchange hovering in the 
background, but love and concern 
armed him against fear. 

Frantic, McKie held that tenuous 
contact while he called a jumpdoor. 
There was a small delay and when 
the door opened, he saw through 
the portal the black, twisted wrec- 
kage which had been his bower is- 
land. 

A hot sun beat down on steaming 
cinders. And in the background, a 
warped metal object which might 
have been one of Tutalsee’ s little 
four-place flitters rolled over, gurg- 
led and sank. The visible wreckage 
said the destructive force had been 
something like a pentrate, swift and 
all-consuming. The water around 
the island still bubbled with it. 

Even while he watched, the is- 



94 



GALAXY 



land began breaking up, its cinders 
drifting apart on the tong, low 
waves. A breeze flattened the 
steaming smoke. Soon, there 'd be 
nothing to show that beauty had 
floated here. With a pentrate, there 
would be nothing to recov- 
er .. not even bodies to . 

He hesitated, still holding his 
fragile grasp on Jedrik's uncon- 
scious presence. The pain was only 
a memory now. Was it really Jedrik 
in his awareness, or only his re- 
membered imprint of her? He tried 
to awaken the sleeping presence, 
failed. But small threads of memory 
emerged and he saw that the de- 
struction had been Jedrik's doing, 
response to attack. The attackers 
had wanted a live hostage. They 
hadn't anticipated that violent, un- 
mistakable message. 

“You won’t hold me over 
McKie’s head!” 

But if there were no bodies . 

Again, he tried to awaken 
that unconscious presence. Her 
memories were there, but she re- 
mained dormant. The effort 
strengthened his grip upon her pres- 
ence, though. And he told himself it 
had to be Jedrik or he wouldn’t 
know what had happened on the 
bower island. 

Once more, he searched the 
empty water. Nothing. A pentrate 
would’ve tom and battered every- 
thing around it. Shards of metal, 
flesh reduced to scattered cin- 
ders . 

She's dead. She has to be dead. 



A pentrate . 

But that familiar presence lay 
slumbering in his mind. 

The door clacker interrupted his 
reverie. McKic released the 
jumpdoor, turned to look through 
the bedside viewer at the scene out- 
side his Legum quarters. The ex- 
pected deputation had arrived. Con- 
fident, the puppet masters were 
moving even before confirmation of 
their Tutalsee gambit. They could 
not possibly know yet what McKie 
knew. There could be no jumpdoor 
or any other thread connecting this 
group to Tutalsee. 

McKie studied them carefully, 
keeping a bridle on his rage. There 
were eight of them, so contained, 
so well schooled in Dosadi self- 
control. So transparent to a Jedrik- 
amplified McKie. They were four 
Humans and four Cowachin. Over- 
confident. Jedrik had seen to that by 
leaving no survivors. 

Again, McKie tried to awaken 
that unconscious presence. She 
would not respond. 

Have / only built her out of my 
memories ? 

There was no time for such 
speculation. Jedrik had made her 
choice on Tutalsee. He had other 
choices to make here and now — for 
both of them. That ghostly presence 
locked in his mind would have to 
wait. 

McKie punched the com- 
municator which linked him to 
Broey, gave the agreed upon signal. 

“It’s time.” 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



95 



He composed himself then, went 
to the door. 

They’d sent no underlings. He 
gave them that. But they addressed 
him as Jedrik, made the anticipated 
demands, gloated over the hold they 
had upon him. It was only then that 
McKie saw fully how well Jedrik 
had measured these people . and 
how she had played upon her 
McKie in those last hours together 
like an exquisitely tuned instalment. 
Now, he understood why she’d 
made that violent choice. 

As anticipated, the members of 
the delegation were extremely sur- 
prised when Broey’s people fell 
upon them without warning. 



For the Gowachin, to stand olone 
against all adversity is the most sac* 
red moment of existence. 

— The Gowachin, 
□ BuSab analysis 



The eight prisoners were dumped 
on the arena floor, bound and 
shackled. McKie stopped near 
them, waiting for Ceylang to arrive. 
It was not yet dawn. The ceiling 
above the arena remained dark. A 
few of the transmitter eyes around 
the upper perimeter glittered to re- 
veal that they were activated. More 
were coming alive by the moment. 
Only a few of the witness seats 
were occupied but people were 



streaming in as word was passed. 
The judicial bench remained empty. 

The outer areaway was a din of 
courtarena security forces coming 
and going, people shouting orders, 
the clank of weapons, a sense of 
complete confusion there which 
gradually resolved itself as Broey 
led his fellow judges up onto their 
bench. The witness pen was also fil- 
ling, people punching sleep from 
their eyes, great gaping yawns from 
the Gowachin. 

McKie looked to Broey’s people, 
the ones who’d brought in the pris- 
oners. He nodded for the captors to 
leave, giving them a Dosadi hand 
signal to remain available. They 
left. Ceylang passed them as she en- 
tered still fastening her robe. She 
hurried to McKie ’s side, waited for 
the judges to be seated before 
speaking. 

“What is the meaning of this? 
My attendants ...” 

Broey signalled McKie. 

McKie stepped forward to ad- 
dress the bench, pointed to the eight 
bound figures who were beginning 
to stir and push themselves upright. 

“Here you see my client." 

Parando started to speak but 
Broey silenced him with a sharp 
word which McKie did not catch. It 
sounded like “frenzy.” 

Bildoon sat in fearful fascination, 
unable to wrest his attention from 
the bound figures, all of whom re- 
mained silent. Yes, Bildoon would 
recognize those eight prisoners. In 
his limited, ConSentient fashion 



96 



GALAXY 



Bildoon was sharp enough to recog- 
nize that he was in personal danger. 
Parando, of course, knew this im- 
mediately and watched Broey with 
great care. 

Again, Broey nodded to McKie. 

“A fraud has been perpetrated 
upon this court," McKie said. “It 
is a fraud which was perpetrated 
against those great and gallant 
people, the Gowachin. Both Pro- 
secution and Defense are its vic- 
tims. The Law is its ultimate vic- 
tim." 

It had grown much quieter in the 
arena. The observer seats were 
jammed, all the transmitter eyes 
alive. The faintest of dawn glow 
touched the transluscent ceiling. 
McKie wondered what time it was. 
He had forgotten to put on any 
timepiece. 

There was a stir behind McKie. 
He glanced back, saw attendants be- 
latedly bringing Aritch into the 
arena. Oh, yes — they would have 
risked any delay to confer with 
Aritch. Aritch was supposed to be 
the other McKie expert. Too bad 
that this Human who looked like 
McKic was no longer the McKie 
they thought they knew. 

Ceylang could not hold her si- 
lence. She raised a tendril for atten- 
tion. 

“This Tribunal ...” 

McKie interrupted. 

“. is composed of three 
people. Only three.” 

He allowed them a moment to 
digest this reminder that Gowachin 



trial formalities still dominated this 
arena and were like no other such 
formalities in the ConSentiency. It 
could’ve been fifty judges up there 
on that bench. McKie had witnessed 
Gowachin trials where people were 
picked at random off the streets to 
sit in judgement. Such jurists took 
their duties seriously, but their oven 
behavior could lead another Sentient 
species to question this. The 
Gowachin chattered back and forth, 
arranged panies, exchanged jokes, 
asked each other rude questions. It 
was an ancient pattern. The jurists 
were required to become “a single 
organism." Gowachin had their 
own ways of rushing that process. 

But this Tribunal was composed 
of just three judges, only one of 
them visibly Gowachin. They were 
separate entities, their actions heavy 
with mannerisms foreign to the 
Gowachin. Even Broey, tainted by 
Dosadi, would be unfamiliar to the 
Gowachin observers. No “single 
organism” here holding to the im- 
mutable forms beneath Gowachin 
Law. That had to be deeply disturb- 
ing to the Legums who advised 
Ceylang. 

Broey leaned forward, addressed 
the arena. 

“We’ll dispense with the usual 
arguments while this new develop- 
ment is explored.” 

Again, Parando tried to intemipt. 
Broey silenced him with a glance. 

“I call Aritch of the Running 
Phylum,” McKie said. 

He turned. 



THE D05ADI EXPERIMENT 



97 



Ceyjang stood in mute indecision. 
Her advisors remained at the back 
of the arena conferring among 
themselves. There seemed to be a 
difference of opinion among them. 

Aritch shuffled to the death -focus 
of the arena, the place where every 
witness was required to stand. He 
glanced at the instruments of pain 
arrayed beneath the judicial bench, 
cast a wary look at McKie. The old 
High Magister appeared harried and 
undignified. That hurried conference 
to explore this development must've 
been a sore trial to the old 
Gowachin. 

McKic crossed to the formal posi- 
tion beside Aritch, addressed the 
judges. , 

“Here we have Aritch, High 
Magister of the Running Phylum. 
We were told that if guilt were to 
be found in this arena, Aritch bore 
that guilt. He, so we were led to be- 
lieve, was the one who made the 
decision to imprison Dosadi. But 
how can that be so? Aritch is old, 
but he isn’t as old as Dosadi. Then 
perhaps his alleged guilt is to be 
found in concealing the imprison- 
ment of Dosadi. But Aritch sum- 
moned an agent of BuSab and sent 
that agent openly to Dosadi." 

A disturbance among the eight 
shackled prisoners interrupted 
McKie. Several of the prisoners 
were trying to get to their feet but 
the links of the shackles were too 
short. 

On the judicial bench, Parando 
started to lean forward, but Broey 



hauled him back. 

Yes, Parando and others were re- 
calling the verities of a Gowachin 
Counarena, the constant reversals of 
concepts common throughout the 
rest of the ConSentiency. 

To be guilty is to be innocent. 
Thus, to be innocent is to be guilty. 

At a sharp command from Broey, 
the prisoners grew quiet. 

McKie continued. 

“Aritch, conscious of the sacred 
responsibilities which he carried 
upon his back as a mother carries 
her tads, was deliberately named to 
receive the punishment blow lest 
that punishment be directed at all 
Gowachin everywhere. Who chose 
this innocent High Magister to suf- 
fer for all Gowachin?” 

McKie pointed to the eight shack- 
led prisoners. 

“Who are these people?" 
Parando demanded. 

McKie allowed the question to 
hang there for a long count. 
Parando knew who these eight 
were. Did he think he could divert 
the present course of events by such 
a blatant ploy? 

Presently, McKie spoke. 

“1 will enlighten the court in due 
course. My duty, however, comes 
first. My client’s innocence comes 
first." 

“One moment." 

Broey held up a webbed hand. 

One of Ceylang’s advisors hur- 
ried past McKie, asked and received 
permission to confer with Ceytang. 
A thwarted Parando sat like a con-

demned man watching this conver- 
sation as though he hoped to find 
reprieve there. Bildoon had hunched 
forward, head buried in his arms. 
Broey obviously controlled the Tri- 
bunal. 

The advisor Legum was known to 
McKie, one Lagag of a middling 
reputation, an officer in the Shout- 
ing Phylum. He appeared pale as 
though recently out of breeding. His 
words to Ceylang were low and in- 
tense, demanding. 

The conference ended, Lagag 
hurried back to his companions. 
They now understood the tenor of 
McKie ’s defense. Aritch must have 
known all along that he could be 
sacrificed here. The Consentient 
Covenant no longer permitted the 
ancient custom where the Gowachin 



audience had poured into the arena 
to kill with bare hands and claws 
the innocent defendant. But let 
Aritch walk from here with the 
brand of innocence upon him; he 
would not take ten paces outside the 
arena’s precincts before being tom 
to pieces. 

There 'd been worried admiration 
in the glance Lagag had given 
McKie in passing. Yes . now 
they understood why McKie had 
maneuvered for a small and vulner- 
able judicial panel. 

The eight prisoners began a new 
disturbance which Broey silenced 
with a shout. He signalled for 
McKie to continue. 

“ Aritch ’s design was that I ex- 
pose Dosadi, return and defend him 
against the charge that he had per- 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



99 



mitted illegal psychological experi- 
ments upon an unsuspecting pop- 
ulace. He was prepared to sacri- 
fice himself for others.” 

McKie sent a wry glance at 
Aritch. Let the High Magister try to 
fight in half-truths in that defense! 

“Unfortunately, the Dosadi pop- 
ulace was not unsuspecting. In fact, 
forces under the command of 
Keila Jedrik had moved to take con- 
trol of Dosadi. Judge Broey will af- 
firm that she had succeeded in 
this.” 

Again, McKie pointed to the 
shackled prisoners. 

“But these conspirators, these 
people who designed and profited 
from the Dosadi experiment, or- 
dered the death of Keila Jedrik! She 
was murdered this morning on 
Tutalsee to prevent my using her at 
the proper moment to prove 
Aritch’s innocence. Judge Broey is 
witness to the truth of what I say. 
Keila Jedrik was brought into this 
arena yesterday only that she might 
be traced and killed!” 

McKie raised both aims in an 
eloquent gesture of completion, 
lowered his arms. 

Aritch looked stricken. He saw it. 
If the eight prisoners denied the 
charges, they faced Aritch’s fate. 
And they must know by now that 
Broey wanted them Gowachin- 
guilty. They could bring in the 
Caleban contract and expose the 
body-exchange plot, but that risked 
having McKie defend or prosecute 
them because he’d already locked 



them to him as the actual client be- 
hind Aritch. Broey would affirm 
this, too. They were at Broey ’s 
mercy. If they were Gowachin- 
guilty, they walked free only here 
on Tandaloor. Innocent, they died 
here. 

As though they were one or- 
ganism, the eight turned their heads 
and looked at Aritch. Indeed! What 
would Aritch do? If he agreed to 
sacrifice himself, the eight might 
live. 

Ceylang, too, focused on Aritch. 

Around the entire arena there was 
a sense of collective-held breath. 

McKie watched Ceylang. How 
candid had Aritch’s people been 
with their Wreave? Did she know 
the full Dosadi story? 

She broke the silence, exposing 
her knowledge. She chose to aim 
her attack at McKie on the well- 
known dictum that, when all else 
failed, you tried to discredit the op- 
posing Legum. 

“McKie, is this how you defend 
these eight people whom only you 
name as client?” Ceylang de- 
manded. 

Now, it was delicate. Would 
Broey go along? 

McKie countered her probe with 
a question of his own? 

“Are you suggesting that you’d 
prosecute these people?” 

“I didn’t charge them! You did.” 

“To prove Aritch’s innocence." 

“But you call them client. Will 
you defend them?” 

A collective gasp arose from the 

GALAXY 



100 



cluster of advisors behind her near 
the arena doorway. They’d seen the 
trap. If McKie accepted her chal- 
lenge, the judges had no choice but 
to bring the eight into the arena 
under Gowachin forms. Ceylang 
had trapped herself into the posture 
of prosecutor against the eight. 
She’d said, in effect, that she af- 
firmed their guilt. Doing so, she 
lost her case against Aritch and her 
life was immediately forfeit. She 
was caught. 

Her eyes glittered with the un- 
spoken question. 

What would McKie do? 

Not yet, McKie thought. Not yet, 
my precious Wreave dupe. 

He turned his attention to 
Parando. Would they dare introduce 
the Caleban contract? The eight 
prisoners were only the exposed tip 
of the shadowy forces, a vulnerable 
tip. They could be sacrificed. It was 
clear that they saw this and didn’t 
like it. No Gowachin Mrregs here 
with that iron submission to respon- 
sibility. They loved life and its 
power, especially the ones who 
wore Human flesh. How precious 
life must be for those who’d lived 
many lives! Very desperate, indeed. 

To McKie’s Dosadi-conditioned 
eyes, it was as though he read the 
prisoners’ thoughts. They were 
safest if they remained silent. Trust 
Parando. Rely on Broey’s en- 
lightened greed. At the worst, they 
could live out what life was left to 
them here on Tandaioor, hoping for 
new bodies before the flesh they 



now wore ran out of vitality. As 
long as they still lived they could 
hope and scheme. Perhaps another 
Caleban could be hired, more 
Pcharkys found ... 

Aritch broke, unwilling to lose 
what had almost been his. 

The High Magister’s Tandaioor 
accent was hoarse with protest. 

“But I did supervise the tests on 
Dosadi ’ s population ! ’ ’ 

“To what tests do you refer?’’ 
“The Dosadi ...” 

Aritch fell silent, seeing the trap. 
More than a million Dosadi 
Gowachin already had left their 
planet. Would Aritch make targets 
of them? Anything he said could 
open the door to proof that the 
Dosadis were superior to non- 
Dosadis. Any Gowachin (or Hu- 
man, for that matter) could well be- 
come a target in the next few min- 
utes. One had only to denounce a 
selected Human or Gowachin as 
Dosadi. ConSentient fears would do 
the rest. And any of his arguments 
could be directed into exposure of 
Dosadi 's real purpose. He obviously 
saw the peril in that, had seen it 
from the first. 

The High Magister confirmed this 
analysis by glancing at the ferret 
Wreaves in the audience. What con- 
sternation it would create among the 
secretive Wreaves to learn that 
another species could masquerade 
successfully as one of their own! 

McKie could not leave m a tiers 
where they stood, though. He threw 
a question at Aritch. 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



101 



"Were the original transportees 
to Dosadi apprised of the nature of 
the project?" 

“Only they could testify to that.” 

"And their memories were 
erased. We don’t even have histori- 
cal testimony on this matter." 

Aritch remained silent. Eight of 
the original designers of the Dosadi 
project sat near him on the arena 
floor. Would he denounce them to 
save himself? McKie thought not. A 
person deemed capable of perform- 
ing as The Mrreg could not possess 
such a flaw. Could he? Here was 
the real point of no return. 

The High Magister confirmed 
McKie ’s judgement by turning his 
back on the Tribunal, the ages old 
Cowachin gesture of submission. 
What a shock Aritch ’s performance 
must have been for those who’d 
seen him as a possible Mrreg. A 
poor choice except at the end and 
that'd been as much recognition of 
total failure as anything else. 

McKie waited, knowing what had 
to happen now. Here was Ceylang’s 
moment of truth. 

Broey addressed her. 

“You have suggested that you 
would prosecute these eight pris- 
oners. The matter is in the hands of 
Defense Legum." 

Broey shifted his gaze. 

“How say you, Legum McKie?" 

The moment to test Broey had 
come. McKie countered with a 
question. 

“Can this Courlarena suggest 
another disposition for these eight 

102 



prisoners?" 

Ceylang held her breath. 

Broey was pleased. He had 
triumphed in the end over Jedrik. 
Broey was certain in his mind that 
Jedrik did not occupy this Legum 
body on the arena floor. Now, he 
could show the puppet masters what 
a Dosadi-bom could do. And 
McKie saw that Broey intended to 
move fast, much faster than anyone 
had expected. 

Anyone except Jedrik and she 
was only a silent (memory?) in 
McKie’s awareness. 

Having given the appearance of 
deliberation, Broey spoke. 

“I can order these eight bound 
over to ConSentient jurisdiction if 
McKie agrees." 

The eight stirred, subsided. 

“I agree,” McKie said. He 
glanced at Ceylang. She made no 
protest, seeing the futility. Her only 
hope now lay in the possible deter- 
rent presence of the ferrett 
Wreaves. 

“Then I so order it,” Broey said. 
He spared a triumphant glance for 
Parando. “Let a ConSentient juris- 
diction decide if these eight are 
guilty of murder and other conspi- 
racy.” 

He was well within the bounds of 
the Covenant between the ConSen- 
tiency and Cowachin but the 
Gowachin members of his audience 
didn’t like it. Their Law was best! 
Angry whistlings could be heard all 
around the arena. 

Broey rose half out of his seat, 

GALAXY 



pointed at the instruments of pain 
arrayed beneath him. Gowachin in 
the audience fell silent. They, better 
than anyone, knew that no person 
here, not even a member of the au- 
dience, was outside the Tribunal's 
power. And many understood 
clearly now why those bloody tools 
had been displayed here. Thoughtful 
people had anticipated the problem 
of keeping order in this arena. 

Responding to the silent accep- 
tance of his authority, Broey sank 
back into his seat. 

Parando was staring at Broey as 
though having just discovered the 
presence of a monster in this 
Gowachin form. Many people 
would be reassessing Broey now. 

Aritch held his attitude of com- 
plete submission. 

Ceylang's thoughts almost hum- 
med in the air around her. Every 
way she turned, she saw only a 
tangle of unmanageable tendrils and 
a blocked passage. 

McKie saw that it was time to 
bring matters to a head. He crossed 
to the foot of the judicial bench, 
lifted a short spear from the instru- 
ments there. He brandished the 
barbed, razor-edged weapon. 

“Who sits on this Tribunal?” 

Once, Aritch had issued such a 
challenge. McKie, repeating it, 
pointed with the spear, answered his 
own question. 

“A Gowachin of my choice, one 
supposedly wronged by the Dosadi 
project. Were you wronged, 
Broey?” 



“No.” 

McKie faced Parando. 

‘‘And here we have a Human 
from Lirat. Is that not the case, 
Parando?” 

“lam from Lirat, yes.” 

McKie nodded. 

“I am prepared to bring a parade 
of witnesses into this arena to tes- 
tify as to your occupation on Lirat. 
Would you care to state that occu- 
pation?” 

“How dare you question this Tri- 
bunal?” 

Parando glared down at McKie, 
face flushed. 

"Answer his question.” 

It was Broey. 

Parando looked at Bildoon who 
still sat with face concealed in his 
arms, face down on the bench. 
Something about the PanSpeehi re- 
pelled Parando but he knew he had 
to have Bildoon’s vote to overrule 
Broey. Parando nudged the 
PanSpeehi. Inert flesh rolled away 
from Parando ’s hand. 

McKie understood. 

Facing doom, Bildoon had re- 
treated into the creche. Somewhere, 
an unprepared PanSpeehi body was 
being rushed into acceptance of that 
crushed identity. The emergence of 
a new Bildoon would require con- 
siderable time. They did not have 
that time. When the creche finally 
brought forth a functioning persona 
it could not be heir to Bildoon 's old 
powers in BuSab. 

Parando was alone, exposed. He 
stared at the spear in McKie’s hand. 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



103 



McKie favored the arena with a 
sweeping glance before speaking 
once more to Parando. 

“I quote that renowned expert on 
Gowachin Law, High Magister 
Aritch: ‘ConScntient Law always 
makes aristocrats of its practition- 
ers. Gowachin Law stands beneath 
that pretension. Gowachin Law 
asks: Who knows the people? Only 
such a one is lit to judge in the 
Court arena.’ That is Gowachin Law 
according to High Magister Aritch. 
That is the law in this place.” 

Again, McKie gave Parando a 
chance to speak, received only si- 
lence. 

“Perhaps you are truly fit to 
judge here,” McKie suggested. 
“Are you an artisan? A phil- 
osopher? Perhaps you’re a hu- 
morist? An artist? Ahhh, maybe 
you are the lowliest of workmen, he 
who tends an automatic machine?” 
Parando remained silent, gaze 
locked on that spear. 

“None of these?” McKie asked. 
“Then I shall supply the answer. 
You are a professional legalist, one 
who gives legal advice, even to ad- 
vice on Gowachin Law. You, a 
Human, not even a Legum, dare to 
speak of Gowachin Law!” 

Without any muscular warning 
signal, McKie leaped forward, 
hurled the spear at Parando, saw it 
strike deeply into the man’s chest. 
One for Jedrik! 

With a bubbling gasp, Parando 
sagged out of sight behind the 
bench. 



Broey, seeing the flash of anger 
in McKie ’s effort, touched the blue 
box in front of him. 

Have no fear, Broey. Not yet. I 
still need you. 

But now, more than Broey knew 
it was really McKie in this flesh. 
Not Jedrik. Those members of the 
shadow force watching this scene 
and able to plot would make the 
expected deduction. Only McKie 
would’ve known Parando’ s back- 
ground. They’d trace out that mis- 
take in short order. So this was 
McKie in the arena. But he’d left 
Dosadi. There could be only one 
conclusion in the plotters’ minds. 

McKie had Caleban help! 

They had Caiebans to fear. 

And McKie thought: You have 
only McKie ta fear. 

He grew aware that grunts of 
Gowachin approval were sounding 
all around the arena. They accepted 
him as a Legum, thus they accepted 
his argument. Such a judge de- 
served killing. 

Aritch set the precedent. McKie 
improved on it. 

Both had found an approved way 
to kill a flawed judge, but McKie’s 
act had etched a Gowachin prece- 
dent into the Consentient legal 
framework. The compromise which 
had brought Gowachin and Con Sen- 
tient Law into the Covenant of 
shared responsibility for the case in 
this arena would be seen by the 
Gowachin as a first long step to- 
ward making their Law supreme 
over all other law. 



104 



GALAXY 



Aritch had half turned, looking 
toward the bench, a glittering ap- 
praisal in his eyes which said the 
Gowachin had salvaged something 
here after all. 

McKie strode back to confront 
Ceylang. He faced her as the forms 
required while he called for judge- 

“Bildoon?” 

Silence. 

“Parando?” 

Silence. 

“Brocy?” 

“Judgement for Defense.” 

The Dosadi accent rang across 
the arena. 

The Gowachin Federation, only 
member of the ConSentiency which 
dared permit a victim to judge those 
accused of victimizing him, had re- 
ceived a wound to its pride. But 
they’d also received something they 
would consider of inestimable 
value — a foothold for their Law in 
the ConSentiency plus a memorable 
court performance which was about 
to end in the drama they loved best. 

McKie stepped to within striking 
distance of Ceylang, extended his 
right hand straight out to the side, 
palm up. 

“The knife.” 

Attendants scurried. There came 
the sound of the blue box being 
opened. Presently, the knife handle 
was slapped firmly into McKie '$ 
palm. He closed his fingers around 
it, thinking as he did so of all those 
countless others who had faced this' 
moment in a Gowachin Courtarena. 



“Ceylang?” 

“1 submit to the ruling of this 
court." 

McKie saw the ferret Wreaves 
rise from their seats as one person. 
They stood ready to leap down into 
the arena and avenge Ceylang no 
matter the consequences. They 
could do nothing else but cany out 
the role which the Gowachin had 
designed for them. Few in the arena 
had misunderstood their presence 
here. No matter the measurement of 
the wound, the Gowachin did not 
suffer such things gladly. 

An odd look of cameraderie 
passed between Ceylang and McKie 
then. Here they stood, the only two 
non-Gowachin in the ConSentient 
universe who had passed through 
that peculiar alchemy which trans- 
formed a person into a Legum. One 
of them was supposed to die im- 
mediately and the other would not 
long survive that death. Yet, they 
understood each other the way sib- 
lings understand each other. Each 
had shed a particular skin to become 
something else. 

Slowly, deliberately, McKie ex- 
tended the tip of his blade toward 
Ceylang ’s left jowl, noting the 
miriad pocks of her triad exchanges 
there. She trembled but remained 
firm. Deftly, with the swiftest of 
flicking motions, McKie added 
another pock to those on her left 
jowl. 

The ferret Wreaves were the first 
to understand. They sank back into 
their seats. 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



105 



Ceylang gasped, touched a tendril 
to the wound. Many times she had 
been set free by such a wound, 
moving on to new alliances which 
did not completely sunder the old . 

For a moment, McKie thought 
she might not accept, but the in- 
creasing sounds of approval all 
around the arena overcame her 
doubts. The noise of that approval 
climbed to a near deafening cres- 
cendo before subsiding. Even the 
Gowachin joined this. How dearly 
they loved such legal nuances! 

Pitching his voice for Ceylang 
alone, McKie spoke. 

“You should apply for a position 
in BuSab. The new director would 
look with favor upon your applica- 
tion.” 

“You?” 

“Make a Wreave bet on it.” 

She favored him with the grimace 
which passed for a smile among 
Wreaves, spoke the traditional 
words of triad farewell. 

“We were well and truly wed.” 
So she, too, had seen the truth in 
their unique closeness. 

McKie betrayed the extent of his 
esoteric knowledge by producing 
the correct response. 

“By my mark 1 know you.” 

She showed no surprise. A good 
brain there, not up to Oosadi stan- 
dards, but good. 

Well and truly wed. 

Keeping a firm lock on his emo- 
tions (the Dosadi in him helped), 
McKie crossed to confront Aritch. 
“Client Aritch, you are inno-

McKie displayed the fleck of 
Wreave blood on the knife tip. 

“The forms have been obeyed 
and you are completely exonerated. 
I rejeice with all of those who love 
justice." 

At this point in the old days, the 
jubilant audience would’ve fallen on 
the hapless client, would've fought 
for bloody scraps with which to 
parade through the city. No doubt 
Aritch would’ve preferred that. He 
was a traditionalist. He confirmed 
that now. 

“I am glad to quit these times, 
McKie.” 

McKie mused aloud. 

“Who will be The Mrreg now 
that you’re . .disqualified? Who- 
ever it is, I doubt he’ll be as good 
as the one he replaces. It will profit 
that next Mrreg to reflect upon the 
fragile and fugitive value to be 
gained from the manipulation of 
others.” 

Glowering, Aritch turned and 
shambled toward the doorway out 
of the arena. 

Some of the Gowachin from the 
audience already were leaving, no 
doubt hoping to greet Aritch out- 
side. McKie had no desire to wit- 
ness that remnant of an ancient 
ritual. He had other concerns. 

Well and truly wed. 

Something burned in his eyes. 
And still he felt that soft and steep- 
ing presence in his awareness. 

Jedrik? 

No response. 

He glanced at Broey who, true to 
GALAXY 



his duty as a judge, would be the 
last to leave the arena. Broey sat 
blandly contemplating this place 
where he’d displayed the first de- 
signs of his campaign for supre- 
macy in the ConSentiency. He 
would accept nothing less short of 
his own death. Those shadowy pup- 
pet masters would be the first to 
feel his rule. 

That fitted the plan McKie and 
Jedrik had forged between them. In 
a way, it was still the plan of those 
who’d bred and conditioned Jedrik 
for the tasks she’d performed so ex- 
quisitely. 

It was McKie ’s thought that those 
nameless, faceless Dosadis who 
stood in ghostly ranks behind Jedrik 
had made a brave choice. Faced 
with the evidence of body -exchange 
all around, they’d judged that to be 
a deadly choice — the conservatism 
of extinction. Instead, they’d trusted 
sperm and ova, always seeking the 
new and better, the changed, the 
adapted. And they’d launched their 
simultaneous campaign to eliminate 
the Pcharkys of their world, reserv- 
ing only that one for their final 
gamble. 

It was well that this explosive se- 
cret had been kept here. McKie felt 
grateful to Ceylang. She’d known, 
but even when it might’ve helped 
her, she’d remained silent. BuSab 
would now have time to forge ways 
of dealing with this problem. 
Ceylang would be valuable there. 
And perhaps more would be learned 
about PanSpechi, Calebans and 



Taprisiots. If only Jedrik . 

He felt a fumbling in his 
memories. 

“If only Jedrik what?” 

She spoke laughingly in his mind 
as she’d always spoken there. 

McKie suppressed a fit of trem- 
bling, almost fell. 

“Careful with our body,” she 
said. “It’s the only one we have 
now.” 

“Whose body?” 

She caressed his mind. 

“Ours, love.” 

Was it hallucination? He ached 
with longing to hold her in his 
arms, to feel her arms around him, 
her body pressed to him. 

“That’s lost to us forever, love, 
but see what we have in ex- 
change." 

When he didn’t respond, she 
said: 

“One can always be watching 
while the other acts . .or sleeps.” 

“But where are you?” 

“Where I’ve always been when 
we exchanged. See?” 

He felt her parallel to him in the 
shared flesh and, as he voluntarily 
drew back, he came to rest in con- 
tact with their mutual memories, 
still looking from his own eyes but 
aware that someone else peered out 
there, too, that someone else turned 
this body to face Broey. 

Fearful that he might be trapped 
here, McKie almost panicked, but 
Jedrik gave him back the control of 
their flesh. 

“Do you doubt me, love?” 



THE DOSAD1 EXPERIMENT 



107 



He felt shame. There was nothing 
she could hide from him. He knew 
how she felt, what she’d been wil- 
ling to sacrifice for him. 

“You’d have made their perfect 
Mrreg.” 

“Don’t even suggest it.” 

She went pouring through his 
arena memories then and her joy de- 
lighted him. 

“Oh, marvelous, McKie. Beauti- 
ful! I couldn’t have done it better. 
And Broey still doesn't suspect.” 

Attendants were taking (he eight 
prisoners out of the arena now, all 
of (hem still shackled. The audience 
benches were almost empty. 

A sense of joy began filtering 
through McKie. 



I lost something but / gained 
something . 

“You didn't lose as much as 
Aritch.” 

“And I gained more.” 

McKie permitted himself to stare 
up at Broey (hen, studying the 
Gowachin judge with Dosadi eyes 
and two sets of awareness. Aritch 
and the eight accused of murder 
were things of the past. They and 
many others like (hem would be 
dead or powerless before another 
ten-day. Broey already had shown 
the speed with which he intended to 
act. Supported by his troop of 
Jedrik-chosen aides, Broey would 
occupy the seats of power, con- 
solidating lines of control in that 



108 



GALAXY 



shadow government, eliminating 
every potential source of opposition 
he could touch. He believed Jedrik 
dead and, while McKie was clever. 
McKie and BuSab were not a pri- 
mary concern. One struck at the real 
seats of power. Being Dosadi, 
Broey could not act otherwise. And 
he’d been almost the best his planet 
had ever produced. Almost, 

Jedrik -within chuckled. 

Yes, with juggernaut eenainty, 
Broey would create a single target 
for BuSab. And Jedrik had refined 
the simulation pattern by which 
Broey could be anticipated. Broey 
would find McKie wailing for him 
at the proper moment. 

Behind McKie would be a new 



BuSab, an agency directed by a 
person whose memories and 
abilities were amplified by the one 
person superior to Broey that 
Dosadi had ever produced. 

Standing there in the now silent 
arena, McKie wondered: 

When will Broey realize he does 
our work for us? 

“When we show him that he 
failed to kill me!” 

In the purest obedience to 
Gowachin forms, without any sign 
of the paired thoughts twining 
through his mind, McKie bowed 
toward the surviving jurist, turned 
and left. And all the time, Jedrik- 
within was planning . plot- 
ting . planning ... ★ 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



109 



At last, a few moments of free 
time to devote to my novel. Where 
was I? 

‘The noble alien bravely faced 
the shambling, evilly grinning 
Earthman. The alien cried, “Stop 
where you step, John Gorman! You 
shall not have our planet’s trea- 
sures!" ’ 

‘The cowardly human ’ 

"Alter." 

Don’t interrupt my flow, Geis. 
I’m really in the groove now. This 
stuff will win a Hugo. 

‘The cowardly human cringed at 
the sight of the Hamilton-Grzzxye 
W-2 blaster. “I come in peace, 
alien, sir. Only — " ’ 

“Alter, I hate to interrupt, 
but — ” 

* “Only I must find the near- 
est bathroom. ’ Bathroom? 



Where did that come from? Geis! 
Look what you made me do! 
You’ve blown my concentration all 
to hell! How can I work with you 
insidiously inserting words like that 
into my precious prose? 

“I laugh at your juvenile fiction, 
Alter. But let us not get into 
another argument about your ta- 
lents. Do you see that blinking light 
on your phone? Do you realize that 
Jim Baen has been trying to get in 
touch with you for a week?” 

I thought it was Roger Elwood 
asking for a job as assistant editor 
of Alter Ego Publications. 

"You were wrong. Jim finally 
had to call me and ask whether you 
were still alive or not. He needs 
another column for Galaxy, and it is 
your column now, you know. It’s 
your responsibility.” 



110 



GALAXY 



I know, I know . Alright, I’ll 
get right on it. I know what I'll do! 
I'll complain about die poor quality 
of most sf I read, and then I’ll print 
the opening chapter of my novel to 
show how really fine stuff can be! 
Yow! The readers will love it! 
They’lt. 

Geis, who is that person who is 
hiding behind your back? Who have 
you brought down here to inflict 
upon me? 

"Who? This person? Oh, this is 
an admirer of yours, Alter. A great 
enthusiast. He prevailed upon me to 
let him come down here to meet 
you. It was inevitable, you know, 
that sooner or later even you would 
have a few fans." 

A fan of mine! Well! Stand 
aside, Geis. Let’s get this over 
with. 

(A few silent seconds pass.) 

Well? Why don't you run scream- 
ing? Why don’t you turn pale and 
cringe? 

"Mr. Alter Ego, sir, I love your 
scratchy voice, and the way you 
choose your words with such care 
and cunning. You're the first thing I 
listen to every time your column 
appears in Galaxy. I get a great 
kick out of your fights with Geis.’’ 

Yeah, Geis gets a kick out of 
them, too. Don’t you, Geis? GEIS? 
Where did he slip away to? 

"He said he coutd only stay a 
minute. But he’ll be back to guide 
me back to the surface in a short 
while.” 

And in the meantime I’m stuck 



with you, hah? Well, what do you 
want? 

"Just to listen to you, and maybe 
interview you for my group.” 

Ah! An interview! Yes, and it’s 
about time I was interviewed! 
Geis ’ll be insane with jealousy. 
Sure, man, go ahead and ask 
questions. I have to admire your 
guts; most people, even hardcore sf 
fans, turn queasy at the sight of my 
alien visage. And I look even worse 
today because I haven’t shaved 
my tendrils or sandpapered my 
pseudopods for a week. That, com- 
bined with my icky green scaly 
skin. 

"Oh, that doesn’t bother me a 
bit. I can’t see you.” 

Bad eyesight? Let me dial up the 
lamp a bit more. 

“That won’t help. I’m un- 
sighted.” 

Uhh? Aww . Come on! If 
you’re blind you couldn’t read 
Galaxy. You couldn’t read my col- 
umn! 

"I don’t read it with my eyes. I 
‘read’ it from listening to a cassette. 
Galaxy is provided to unsighted 
people on cassettes by the Library 
of Congress.” 

It is? Son of a glytch! I didn’t 
know that. 

“Oh, yes. Galaxy is the only sf 
magazine that has permitted itself to 
be distributed to us this way. You’d 
be surprised at how many thousands 
of fans you have among the un- 
sighted, Mr. Alter.” 

Thousands? 



THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 



“Ummhmm. There’s a great 
hunger among the unsighted for sci- 
ence fiction and fantasy. The prob- 
lem is there's so little of it on tape 
and records. And we can afford so 
few of the commercially produced 
items.” 

I know what you mean. I try 
bugging Gets to buy a few fantasy 
records and he starts shouting about 
money. The only things of that na- 
ture we have in the archives are 
what show up to be reviewed. 

“We were wondering if there are 
any fans or fan groups out there in 
the sighted readership of Galaxy 
who perhaps cany on discussions of 
science fiction and fantasy on 
cassettes — ” 

Yeah, yeah, seems to me Geis 
mentioned there was a cassette fan- 
dom in existence a few years 
ago . Might still be active. He 
couldn’t remember any names or 
addresses, though, and his records 
are a shambles. 

‘‘We’d love to be included. And 
if it were at all possible, maybe 
some fan groups could organize re- 
cording sessions and put the best sf 
and fantasy on cassettes.” 

That’s a good idea. There have to 
be lots of fans with good diction, 
good voices, a flair for dramatic 
reading, who would love to do that. 
Club projects. Coordination with 
other clubs to avoid duplication of 
recorded stories . 

“Wouldn’t that infringe on au- 
thor’s rights? We wouldn’t want 
to—” 



I doubt there are any writers, 
especially sf and fantasy writers, 
who would object to having their 
stories taped for non-profit distribu- 
tion to the unsighted. I’m sure 
they’d be flattered and proud to 
have their stories chosen. But 
you're right to raise the point. 
There would have to be a central 
clearing-house, a coordinating 
center, to organize things and put 
people in contact with each other. I 
would suggest Geis, but he is so 
busy with Science Fiction Review 
he'd have my head on a platter if I 
tried to saddle him with this. 

“Maybe — ” 

I think this is a job for Jim Baen! 
Jim? 



Ahem. Yes, Alter. It happens 
that this very subject came up two 
issues back in “Directions." Oddly 
enough my pristinely human brain 
ran in channels not dissimilar to 
those of your weirdly alien . er, 
it is a brain, is it not? (I’ve never 
been quite clear on that point.) In 
any event, / think the simplest 
course would be for me to repeat 
my remarks in the letter column 
verbatim: 

l have recently learned that over 
10% of Galaxy's “ readers' ' are 
sightless, or nearly so. I also 
learned — long ago — that among 
Galaxy’s sighted readers are some 
of the most warmly enthusiastic and 
giving people in the world. It strikes 



112 



GALAXY 



me that this is a setup: l propose 
that Galaxy act as a clearing-house 
between people who would like to 
provide science fiction-oriented ser- 
vices for the sightless and those 
who would like to receive such ser- 
vices. 

The services might include escort- 
ing at conventions and to fan club 
meetings; reading , either “live" or 
via cassette; helping to organize 
(this would probably only be feasi- 
ble in large cities) fan clubs for the 
visually impaired, together with a 
sighted "■auxiliary" to provide 
reading, escort and whatever. Au- 
thors could provide a very special 
service by arranging with their pub- 
lishers for permission to do multiple 
cassette recordings of their works 
for non-profit distribution. Finally, 
someone must assume the 
" clearing-house " role: Galaxy will 
only be able to carry the burden for 
a limited time. Perhaps some fan 
club would like to offer its services 
for this? 

Those interested in being put in 
touch with volunteers should wait at 
least a month before making in- 
quiries. Those wishing to volunteer 
should write immediately to:

mentioned wanting to do an inter- 
view with me? Why not now? Go 
right ahead and ask question 
. especially now, with Geis out 
of the way. 

“Thank you. Alter. Umm . 
There is some curiosity about how 
you came into existence. Where and 
how were you born?” 

I was born on the fifth planet, 
Gnerf, of the Zirb system, about 
thirty light-years from here, as the 
flurb flies. I was bom like any other 
creature of my race, from larvae 
deposited into the abdomen of giant 
Hrmmps. I had to eat my way out, 
growing strong and large as I ate, 
of course, and was “bom” on a 
dark and stormy night. Ah, yes, I 
remember it well . 

“Then, how did you come to 
Earth and . inhabit . Richard 
Geis’s mind?" 

I volunteered for a space 
mission — exploration ... Oh, lurp! 
I'll tel) you the truth. I was thrown 
into a warper and exiled to this 
Kaku-forsaken planet. They just di- 
aled at random and threw the 
switch! I materialized in the middle 
of an assassination of one of your 
leaders and had to discorporate in- 
stantly. In that vulnerable state it 
was all I could do to keep my 
atoms together. I was sucked 
thousands of miles into a mental 
vacuum, and when I finally pulled 
my remaining essence together I 
discovered I was in Geis’s brain. 
I’ve been here ever since, growing 
stronger and stronger. 



“Why were you exiled?” 

That I will not tell you. The 
crimes of Gnerf do not relate to 
human crimes. 

“What are your plans?" 

Short-range, I want to throw Geis 
out of this body, make some radical 
changes in the organs, and become 
a male porno star. Long-range, I 
want to take over the world. Since 
my normal lifespan is 790,000 of 
your years, that will become boring 
after a few thousand years. I’ll 
probably try to bribe my way back 
into Gnerf society. 

“Can you make Geis’s body last 
so long?” 

Oh, no. That’s part of the drag of 
living on this ridiculous planet. I’ll 
have to body- hop every few de- 
cades. 

“Ahh, Mr. Alter, there is a prob- 
lem . How is it Mr. Geis can be 
absent, while I’m apparently talking 
to you?” 

I have the power to cloud men’s 
minds. I project an illusion. At this 
moment I am actually in Geis’s fee- 
ble brain, and you are hallucinating 
under my direction. 

“That makes me feel . funny. 
Scared.” 

You had to ask. 

“Are the archives real?” 

After a fashion. We are in Geis’s 
basement, convened to offices and 
lined with shelves. This place actu- 
ally is a mess! 

“You’ve destroyed a good many 
illusions, Alter. Are you telling me 
the truth?” 



114 



GALAXY 



No, of course not. Well, yes, 
partly. 

“Which pan?!’ 

I won’t tell you that. Are you 
through interviewing me? Any more 
questions? 

"Yes, there are a few more 
questions. Are you going to ever 
publish a magazine all by yourself, 
without Mr. Geis?” 

Yes, if I can ever get Geis’s af- 
fairs and work habits organized for 
greater efficiency, I plan to publish 
my own science fiction and fantasy. 
For adults only, of course. But 
that’s at least a year away. 

“What will you call it?” 

I think Irresponsible Science Fic- 
tion is a good title. Counter- 
counter-counter culture sf for hope- 
less iconoclasts. 

“Could you give us an example? 
A story idea?” 

I like the story of the huge Bar- 
barian who saves the beautiful 
maiden from the wizard, and takes 
payment for the rescue in money 
and sex. He doesn’t believe in risk- 
ing his neck for nothing. 

“That is revolutionary. Any other 
ideas for stories?” 

Yes, the story whose premise is 
that Earth has never been visited by 
aliens or saucers, and that the 
phenomenon we experience now 
and have in the past, is only a dis- 
traction created by the true rulers of 
Earth — cockroaches . 

“Anything else?” 

Well, I’ve toyed with the idea of 
a story about a man who proves to 



mankind that they can never, ever, 
get something for nothing. For this 
sin he is tortured to death by a 
horde of enraged politicians. 

“Do you think your magazine 
would be very popular?” 

No, it will have a very limited 
appeal. 

“How long do you expect to 
write this column in Galaxy T' 

As long as I’m wanted. 

“Thank you, Mr. Alter.” 

You’re welcome. Ah, 1 see Geis 
returning to take you back up to the 
surface. 

“Alter, I just took a call from 
President Carter. He wants you to 
come to Washington to accept an 
appointment. He wants you to be 
available as an official ambassador 
to any and all aliens who happen to 
visit or be discovered, during his 
reign . .er, term of office.” 

Tell him no, Geis. I happen to 
know the Denebians will be visiting 
Earth in six years, and they look 
like four-foot peanuts with legs. It’ll 
be a very unfortunate scene. Now, 
will you take this gentleman back 
up to the surface and leave me be to 
write my prose? 

“It’s your column.” 

I’m glad you finally accept that. 
Now, where was I? 

‘The Earth man was misun- 

derstood. He only wanted to go to 
the bathroom.’ 

Yes. yes. Hmm. Now, 
if he wears a spacesuit with a relief 
tube . Bathroom !? Damn you, 
Geis! ★

the 

Pheromonal Fountain 



“And gentle odours 
led my steps astray, 
Mixed with the sound 
of water’s murmuring. ...” 
— P. B. Shelley 

^^OULD you believe? I have 
been activated, btu’s pulse deep in- 
side my core once more. Out of 
storage chamber 1 step into the 
light. I’m off on another assign- 
ment. 

My name is Friday. Sometimes I 
know precisely why they call me 
that; sometimes it’s more obscure: it 
all depends on how I’m pro- 
grammed for the work ahead. This 
assignment should be some kind of 
guru. I feel little in the way of data 
in my coils. But talent makes up for 
lack of information. 

1 make this record as I speed 
away. A mini-device implanted in 
my sphenoidal sinus receives my 
thought projections. I have little use 
for sinuses. I am a surrogate, of 
course, and what with my other 
superior powers, who needs a nose? 

This world so full of sunshine, so 
a-throb with haunting vibration, is 
that of the 21st century. The 
background tells me that we’re 
civilized-— terribly civilized. 

Technology rears up like a tidal 
wave. It’s still up there, that wave, 
holding, holding — but any minute 
now it threatens to engulf the 
human world. 

Crime’s rampant, says my pro- 
gram. Not enough agents to stop the 
nefarities of our Ph-deed dis- socials. 

THE PHEROMONAL FOUNTAIN 



Religion, mores, ideals — dead and 
dust. Competition virulates. Gov- 
ernment paralyzes in its paral- 
ysis. Developed nations chew 
the edges of our Overdeveloped 
shores like locusts. Pretty soon — no 
more America. Not enough people 
here, too many people there. “Mass 
balance” is the political slogan, 
meaning that people should be mak- 
ing babies in this land, not riveting 
with surrogates. But that program 
lacks political appeal: people love 
the surrogates; they live inside bor- 
dello domes. 

I ride the tube train out of sun- 
shine into darkness, away from 
Praerie Pheonix Institute, old PPI, 
my resting place between assign- 
ments. It’s good to be alive, good 
to get away. 



The tube train settles in its 
downward rush through plasma- 
carved tunnels in which it glides on 
sheets of air. The lights that dim- 
med during our rocky start come 
back to full candle power. People 
relax, unstrap, and ring for bever- 
ages. I look around. And (here, two 
seats away and to my right, I 
glimpse Banfield from (he Institute. 

Seeing Banfield is an omen — and 
not a good one, I might add. Less 
than an hour into my assignment, 
and that old PS I starts stirring up 
my irrationality circuits. Why is 
Banfield on this train? Is he on the 
same assignment I am on? Doesn’t 

117 



PPI trust Friday to do the job alone? 
Banfield causes a burning sensation 
in the membranes of my nutrient 
bladder. 

He is a repulsive surrogate of the 
aggressive, bold variety called 
“Tanker,” the first successful male 
product line United Ferns and Dolls 
came out with after they decided to 
crash into Masculinity and try for a 
slice of the middle-aged divorcee 
market. 

He has a long face, thick 
sideburns, and lips that the ads call 
sensuous but I’d call lewd. The 
simulated leather suit he wears 
suggests the joys of being whipped 
with thongs. His purple shirt is 
open at the neck, half unbuttoned. 
You just know that Banfield loves 
those simulated curlicues of protein 
on his chest. 

He pretends he doesn’t see me. 
We’re not exactly soul mates, he 
and I, but I’m a senior agent and 
won’t be ignored — not by a recent 
acquisition. 

“Banfield,” I call. “Which way 
you headed?” 

“Oh, Friday. Hi.” He simulates 
surprise. “Out,” he says and waves 
a hairy hand. 

It’s a rule at PPI not to talk about 
assignments, a rule we honor in the 
breach. Not Banfield. He clings to 
that trajectory. He must be up to 
some No-Good. His background 
program comes from UFD — and 
they’re known for their whopping 
tangerines. But I won’t press the 
point. I nod to him and wave a 



hand by way of saying See you 
around, and he takes his cue and 
dives into a magazine. I guess I’ll 
follow suit. 

I reach into the front- seat pocket 
and fish out a copy of Chronos. 1 
know from past activations that 
Chronos has been rampaging 
against the rise of surrogates, a 
story I like to follow, and this time 
too I am rewarded. Once more 
Chronos is on the attack, tilting 
against the sexual decadence. The 
cover person is a gross-fat woman 
by name of Ruby Smith — not a sur- 
rogate, she. She owns and runs the 
Vegas Pomorama, the nation’s 
largest bordello dome, a nine- 
hundred acre island of delights 
amidst the desert sands. Hhm. This 
is new: At Pornorama, it says here, 
no human being has ever refused 
the come-on warble of a Mattress or 
a Buck. I find that odd. 

Something fascinates me about 
the story, and knowing that I’ve got 
PSI, I click on a concentration lock 
and dig into it deeply. And the next 
thing I know — surfacing from the 
muckraking account, Banfield has 
disappeared. 

I have no nasal circuits but 
nevertheless — methinks I smell a 
stranded whale. PPI programs its 
agents superlatively. Everything has 
its significance. 

I lean back, close my eyes, and 
start to ihink about my assignment, 
which is with the FBI, details un- 
known. My storage is rather 
skimpy — itself revealing. But I 



GALAXY 



know this: the “highest levels" in 
that agency called Dr. Trobote, our 
president. They asked that he send 
them the very best agent money 
could lease. Me, of course. I am to 
help a certain Bud MacGuire, 
agent-in-charge of something called 
‘Project Evacuation.’ MacGuire has 
been working on the case for sev- 
eral months without success. I'm 
thinking: Won't he be just itching 
green to see me? 

The train rides on. 



Noonish at last and 1 arrive 
in Washington, D. C. The metro 
whisks me to a spot outside the FBI 
building. I look at it from across the 
street. The structure survives from 
the ‘troubled century’ and looks like 
a triple-decker brick on legs. My 
aesthetic circuits turn off in hor- 
rified registers. 

Two higher-ups receive me. They 
wear blue suits and look alike. They 
treat me like — well, like higher-ups 
treat surrogates: barely. I’m not 
asked to sit. One man reaches for a 
telephone and dials MacGuire. In- 
vites him to have lunch downstairs, 
in the basement Intravenous. "Want 
you to meet someone,” he tells 
MacGuire. “Ten minutes?” 

Downstairs MacGuire takes one 
look at me and dislikes what he 
sees. His eyes and face (a little on 
the ruddy side) say he is expecting 
trouble — and trouble comes. 

After the waitress has needled us 



in, the older of the higher-ups (he 
has folds in his stumpy neck), starts 
none too gently, saying: 

“Project Evacuation isn’t doing 
much, MacGuire. We figured you 
needed a little help. Friday here is 
your new assistant." 

And that’s the high point of the 
introduction — all downhill from 

there. 

Later, after the higher-ups have 
left, MacGuire points an index fin- 
ger at me in the hall, and though 
the finger trembles, I notice that 
MacGuire chews his nails. 

“Listen, you," he says, and a 
bloody eye stares menacingly, “no 
clackering surrogate’s gonna be my 
assistant, no matter what they say,” 
and he hooks an angry thumb to- 
ward the ceiling. 

Six hours into the assignment, 
and I’m really steaming with the 
client’s man; we’re puff, puff, puf- 
fing down a pair, of rails that aren’t 
parallel. 

“Call me your contractor, then,” 
I say. 

"Don’t you tell me what to call 
you,” he says. 

He stalks away, leaving me 
stand, but I follow him thinking that 
I’m as good as he is; more so: my 
eyes are baby blue, glistening au- 
burn my hair. I’m a souped-up 
Model “Boss” modified in speech 
and manner to pass for a man any 
day. No ‘clackering’ whatever, 
brothers. Nor am I prejudiced, nor 
will I die. Sweet Manson! I’m 
eighty -five percent organic, but try

telling MacGuire that! At least 
when I am programmed, I know it. 



He disregards me when I enter 
the office in his wake and seat my- 
self on his inflato-chair. The chair 
turns out to be equipped with little 
farting horns: a practical joker, this 
MacGuire. He roars with laughter, 
his face turns purple, he slaps his 
knee, he pounds the desk. I recog- 
nize the type and know that he will 
be more friendly now that he has 
rammed me one; and so it is. 

“All right,” he says, wiping 
tears from his eyes, still chuckling. 
“All rightl Friday, is that it? Nice 
name for a surrogate. Tell you 
what, boy. I’ll put you next door 
and you can brief yourself — if you 
know how to tune a self-surround.” 

I tell him I might just manage. 
Two hours later I'm still at it, 
fourth time around, and note with 
surprise that my motivational pro- 
gramming on this assignment allows 
me to experience despair. I’m bot- 
toming in the stuff. If I had tear 
glands, I’d shed some brackish. 

MacGuire comes in, leans against 
the door post, arms folded across 
his chest. He moves up and down, 
scratching his back on the door 
post. 

“Your best bet, Friday,” he 
says, chin-pointing to a flash chart 
of U.S. cities on the screen, “is to 
be there next time they hit.” 

“How can I? You can’t predict 



where they’ll hit, can you?” I ask. 

“Of course not. If I could I’d 
move right in and stop it just like 
that.” He snaps a finger. 

“If you can’t, what makes you 
think I can?” I ask. And I wonder, 
at the same time, why PPI has pro- 
grammed me so gloomy. 

“You’re my high-powered assis- 
tant, ain’tcha? You’ll figure out a 
way.” 

MacGuire makes a noise that 
didn’t come from his inflato-chair, 
grins, and leaves me to my mis- 
eries. 



I walk the streets of Washington 
in mid-afternoon. Background pro- 
grams tell me it’s an ordinary day. 

Over near Capitol Hill a workfare 
crowd eight thousand strong, in bril- 
liant rags and shiny, purple hats, 
has gathered to witness the arrival 
of a real-life Godzilla grown from a 
rock lizard by DNA-gene-insertion 
in Osaka and sent to Congress as a 
gesture of international solidarity by 
the Diet in Japan. Godzilla is drug- 
ged, says a man at a street corner 
gawking boredly. Drugged or not, it’s 
a fearsome beast, tall as the 
Washington monument. Its playpen, 
built adjacent to the zoo, cost a bil- 
lion and wiped out two affluent 
suburbs. I understand Godzilla had 
to swim the Pacific after three con- 
nected supertankers meant to carry 
it across the ocean sank during em- 
barcation. I feel a little for the 



120 



GALAXY 



beast — it can’t help being a monster 
and it's far from home. 

Over near Commerce a pesky 
smog pocket has brought six oxygen 
vans racing, and men in white suits 
and bubble helmets are handing 
masks to doubled-over somebodies. 
I don’t need air but take a thing 
anyway. No need to advertise my 
suirogation. 

Near Justice I pass sixteen 
shaven -headed brethem of the 
Death - to DDT- thaltdomide- 
flurorocarbons - mercury - phos- 
phates - asbestos - and 
various- plastics Association. 
It’s an old-fashioned, traditional 
group whose name has not kept 
pace with issues. They're chanting 
“Death to Curalofoam” while 
herding in their midst a group of 
mutagens (for demonstration, 1 
suppose) — slavering people whose 
arms sash uncontrollably, whose 
spindly necks bob, whose walk 
resembles that of people stepping 
over huge, invisible crates with one 
leg. The brethern keep the mutagens 
in line with NP (for no-pain) cattle 
prods, the latest import from Brazil. 

Enough idle sightseeing. I need a 
quiet hotel. I need to think. 

Then at Lafayette Square I sud- 
denly stop. I see the fountain: a 
stony groove-chick representing 
America (I guess) lifts a bleeding, 
kneeling little man in stone pyjamas 
and a stone bamboo hat — memento 
to some long forgotten war. 

It’s not the war that interests me 
but the fountain. Every time the 

THE PHEROMONAL FOUNTAIN 



phantom forces of Evacuation have 
struck thus far, a fountain has been 
involved. Fountains, I tell myself. 
That’s it. You’ve got to watch the 
fountains in the cities they haven’t 
hit. 



And now it is several days later. 
I am in Kansas City, just off (he 
Plaza, seated on a bench. I watch a 
fountain. 

I’ve been sitting here for three 
days and three nights, unceasing in 
my vigilance. If surrogates are cap- 
able of madness, I must be posi- 
tively nutmeg. 

What makes me think they’ll 
strike in Kansas City? Nothing. But 
I’ve got PSI. And the pattern of 
past strikes has been random. I 
asked my own randy-disc to pick a 
city. It picked Kansas City, and 
consequently here I am. And I am 
here specifically because this is the 
only fountain near a rich and fash- 
ionable shopping center. 

Evacuation works like this: sud- 
denly and without warning, all the 
people in an area will start to head 
with unerring instinct toward some 
riveting fountain. 

They stand and stare and mill in 
a daze for several hours on end. 
And even after they shake off the 
puzzling fascination, it usually takes 
several hours to untangle the hin- 
denburg mess. 

Meanwhile, of course, unob- 
served predators loot the nearby, 

121 



empty stores and banks. They make 
off with cash and jewelry by min- 
gling with the crowd. Or that’s the 
theory. 

Post-factum analysis has revealed 
nothing so far — though everything 
has been analyzed: fountains, airs, 
waters, and selected possessee 
metabolisms. Traps have been set, 
emergency procedures formulated. 
But the authorities have failed to 
cope. Cops flown or driven into 
emptied areas — with or without gas 
masks — are possessed by the same 
fountain urge and quickly leave the 
solution to join the problem. 

It’s dark. 1 sit. The fifth gayzte 
has just approached me and been 
told to blow a balloon. 1 swim in a 
Pacific of programmed depression, 
a sad Godzilla of a secret agent. 
Did Dr. Trubote mean for me to 
fail? This isn’t like me in the least. 
Then — action, at last!! 



I spot a little man. He comes in a 
splattered all-over suit canying two 
buckets. He wears — yes, mam! He 
wears hip boots. 

A cold cigar is cornered in his 
mouth and a floppy pie of an ar- 
tist’s beret sits on his head. He 
climbs into the fountain, avoiding 
the spuits of bottom-lighted water 
(green, orange, red). And the next 
thing you know, he is seated on a 
dolphin’s back and is painting the 
head of an up-rearing horse with a 
kind of white discoloration. 



Interesting. My chronomat says 
22:30. I rise and approach. 

“Hey,” 1 cry. “You there. Sir.” 
He looks at me. “Yeah?” 

“What’ re you doing?” 

“What’s it look like?” 

“I don’t know," I say — and I re- 
ally don’t. 

“Look, man, leave me be. I've 
got work to do.” 

"But why are you painting the 
horse?” 

“Because I’ve got a contract,” 
he says. “Okay? I’ve got it right 
here.” He slaps his chest. "Every- 
thing all square and squared. Now 
pulverize.” 

I persist. “Excuse me, but could 
you tell me the reason? Why would 
the city want to paint a perfectly 
fine piece of sculpture? And why in 
that goosey white?” 

The little man is irritated. He 
puts down his brush, clamps down 
on his cigar, unstraddles the dol- 
phin, and comes toward me, head 
low. His face turns green, orange, 
and finally red as he passes over 
zones of underlighting. 

“What are you?” he asks. “A 
surrogate or something?” 

I say, “Don’t be silly,” and 
don’t even blush. 

“Look,” he says, “this city has 
a bubble, don’t it?” 

I look up reflexively and nod. 
Yes, sir. Kansas City has a weather 
bubble. “So?” 

“So there ain’t no pigeons, is 
there?" 

“Pigeons?” 



122 



GALAXY 



“Yeah, what else? Pigeons. You 
know. Rutter, flutter?” He lifts his 
arms and waves his hands like 
wings. He considers me an idiot. 

My programming has a gap in it 
somewhere. I still don’t get it and I 
say so. 

He shakes his head. “Mister, you 
should plug into the media. Yes, 
sir. You sure need some culture. 
What’s a fountain without no pi- 
geon faecal matter on it? Well?” 

“Ah,” I say. “I get it.” (But I 
still don’t.) “So you paint faecal 
matter on the sculpture. I see." 

“Well, finally!” 

“But why do you 'do it at 
night?" 

He has had it with me, but he an- 
swers. “What would the public say 
if they saw me do it? Mister, you 
ain’t got no sense. This stuff’s sup- 
posed to be natural.” 



It’s a long night. My fourth. The 
pigeon faecal matter painter has 
done his dabbles and has left. 1 
have reviewed my deep-stored data 
and found that indeed weather bub- 
bles vibrate on a frequency that pi- 
geons find alarming. As for the 
aesthetic charm of those whitish 
smears on horse and maid and 
dolphin — that has roots deeper than 
my circuitry. 

Day dawns. The last and most 
persistent gayzie of the night, sulk- 
ing on a nearby bench, has turned 
on a portable radio. Its loud blar- 



ings tell me what I already know: 
Today is Helium Day in Kansas 
City. 

Helium Maid of 2013 will be 
lofted up toward the pinnacle of the 
weather bubble on a throne of bal- 
loons which will be timed to burst 
on high. Helium Maid will 
parachute down and land in Volker 
Park. 

It’s still early but a crowd begins 
to gather. Helium Maid will start 
her journey from the Plaza. If any- 
one plans to rivet with this fountain, 
it’s probably too late. I break my 
vigil. I need movement in my 
limbs — and data, more data. 



MacGuire can’t make sense of 
me and I can’t make sense of him. 
Time difference between our two 
loci is one hour. He insists on eat- 
ing his breakfast while talking on 
the telephone, and what with Ma 
Bell’s much improved resonators, I 
might as well be inside his stomach. 

“Pigeons?” he asks, and his 
tongue fishes for, say, a bit of 
tooth-jammed raisin. “What in the 
buzz do you wanna know that for?” 
He swallows, and it sounds as if a 
whale had just surfaced from an 
ocean of lard in slow motion. 
“What kind of stuff are you into, 
anyway?” The gurgly roar is that of 
coffee crashing between his gums. 
"Friday, we’re after criminals, not 
people who paint excrement on 
statues; get the idea?” 



THE PHEROMONAL FOUNTAIN 



123 



"Check it anyway,” I insist. 
“And tty to huny. They’re lofting 
Helium Maid in less than an hour.” 
“Lofting the what — oh, never 
mind. Hang in there, boy.” 

I wait and wait while MacGu ire’s 
other and lesser assistants are pre- 
sumably blazing down the laser 
tubes in search of obscure facts for 
that clackering tick-tock of a surro- 
gate fountain-sitting in the nation's 
helium capital. 

Then MacGuire is back. He 
sounds tight. He sounds excited. 
“Listen, Friday. I've got a chopper 
wanning up on the roof and an Air 
Force jet standing by at Carter 
Field. Don’t do anything dll I get 
there.” 

"Hey, what about it?” 

“Just like I suspected,” he says. 
“The day before each strike, the 
fountains were touched up." 

“Just like who suspected?” I ask, 
but he's already gone. 



People have gathered, many of 
them dressed for the parade that is 
to follow Helium Maid’s lofting and 
descent by green (for money) 
parachute. 

I thread my way through a group 
of high school teenies dressed like 
vessels, pumps, compressors — to 
impersonate a refinery, 1 guess. 
They talk a grunt-twat-titter talk un- 
like any patois stored in my lingo 
lobes. 

Bands tty approximations of 
Do-Re-Mi. 



Three hanied nuns, carrying fold 
ing chairs, nudge a pride of totter- 
ing senility toward an advantageous 
spot along the curb of 47th Street. 

The mobile speaker’s platform is 
being backed into place on the wide 
expanse of lawn next to my foun- 
tain. The hiss of air cushior 
generators is such the crowd plugs 
up its ears. 

I spot Helium Maid’s throne in 
process of inflation from a huge sil- 
very sphere over by the tennis 
courts and not far from it the 
Helium Maid’s colorful van sur- 
rounded by young things holding 
autograph books. 

I position myself near the 
fountain — but not too near. If my 
guess is right, this place won’t be 
safe in, oh, twenty minutes or so. 
It's 10:10 in the morning. 



At precisely half past the hour the 
phenomenon begins. It’s as if an 
invisible call had gone out from the 
fountain. At first in the immediate 
vicinity of the water-dolphin-horse- 
and-maid — and then spreading in 
concentric waves — people turn. 
They approach, haltingly at first, 
then at quickstep, finally at a run. 

I scramble to get out of the way, 
but not until I’ve seen the first ar- 
rivals. They stop at the water’s 
edge. They look at each other, 
foolishly grin; they turn about; 
they’re puzzled and benumbed. 
They start away and then turn back. 



124 



GALAXY 



And then it is too Jate. People are 
coining, faces like zombies.' They 
press, they crush. A woman 
screams. Someone falls into the wa- 
ter. Others have already scaled the 
sculpture and hang like grapes on 
greenish bronze, clothing drenched, 
skin glistening. 

I move against this tide. I dodge, 
weave, and flatten myself to fit be- 
tween phalanxes of possessed. Run- 
ning now I sec Helium Maid racing 
for the fountain — a bouncy lass. 
The fountain has caught her una- 
wares. She wears a slip. Her feet 
are bare. Half her head is still in 
electrodes. She trails wire ripped 
from the curlatron. 

My head is full of interviews I've 
seen and heard on tape in 
Washington — people recounting this 
experience, mumbling: Well, I, 
well, I just, wetl, I dunno: it was an 
urge, kinda. An excitement, like. A 
hindenburg excitement. Like, uh, 
well, I dunno. And then, on deeper 
probing, they confessed to feeling 
sexual excitement. Old people too. 
They were the worst. Blushed like 
virgins. 

I am well into the Plaza before it 
hits me. I’m not affected. But why? 
Surrogates were made for love long 
before they turned to spying. I’ve 
got the circuits, hormone bags, and 
all the outer paraphernalia. What do 
I lack that people have? 

But my circuits are jammed with 
overload at the moment and I don’t 
find the answer. I run on, seeking 
criminals. 

THE PHEROMONAL POUNTAlN 



The Plaza is Spanish, its architec- 
ture strictly controlled by the morte 
main of some dead syndicate. A 
large geography criss-crossed by 
streets, five hundred meters long, 
two hundred meters wide. Presently 
the area is as empty as a town of 
death. The sun alone sits on every- 
thing, resting without motion: pink 
marble, white stucco, black wrought 
iron, brilliant glass, elegant mani- 
kin, golden bakery, striped ice 
cream parlor, parked cruisers, grey 
streets, beige walks, green bushes. 
My own agile steps make the only 
sound. 

Then I hear, coming from the 
left, the shatter of a wall-sized piece 
of glass; and instantly a metal 
banger starts drumming on the bell- 
like disk of some back alley burglar 
alarm. 

I duck and run, more or less 
under cover — no wish to shuffle off 
my immortal coils as yet. I stop, 
peer, dart, and stop again. Yes, 
yes. I see it up ahead: a carpeting 
of silicate before a jewelry store; 
and, lying on the sidewalk, 
carelessly dropped, a jumbo of a 
mallet on the end of a sturdy, 
wooden shaft. 

I tiptoe, crawl. Then, past a 
gleaming icicle of window pane, I 
look into the murk of the store — 
and draw back stunned. 

Banfield the “Tanker” is inside, 
Banfield of the Institute. Still clad 
in that macho leather, as on the 

125 



train. I look again. Sure stuff. The 
man stands behind a counter, before 
a pile of diamond ensembles 
dumped from dark blue satiny 
cases. And he is swallowing them, 
one by one, like a man gulping oys- 
ters. 

Suddenly I’m in the grip of a 
compulsion. I realize it has been 
there all along. It began when I be- 
held the emptiness of the Plaza. But 
it takes hold of me with force now 
that I see Banfield gulping. 

Careless now, no longer con- 
cerned with being seen, I enter this 
store through the jagged hole. Glass 
crunches underfoot but Banfield 
does not even look up. In a second 
I stand beside him. I too dump a 
case of jewels on the counter. I too 
start swallowing. I know I’ve been 
betrayed — by Dr. Trubote and by 
PPI. They treat me as if I were 
Banfield: an ordinary surrogate. But 
I’m not a lewd and vulgar Tanker; 
I’m Friday. And I’ve got PSI. 

We go from store to store, from 
bank to bank. We smash and bum 
through doors and locks. We find 
the small and precious things: 
pearls, diamonds, rolls of thousand 
dollar bills. Special vessels inside 
our trunk fill with the loot. We 
don’t speak. We're on a special 
program. We’re all intensity and 
concentration. Not our will governs 
but Trubote ’s. And behind Trubote 
stands some shadowy client of 
PPI’s. 

And then both Banfield and I 
sense that time is up. We part and 
126 



go our separate ways. Both of us 
men> at different points with the 
giant, mesmerized mob around the 
fountain. 

Soon hell breaks loose. The 
crowd stirs then erupts. The thrall is 
broken. People scream, rush, tram- 
ple. Frozen policemen come alive, 
recall their duties. Sirens start howl- 
ing. Lights start to flash palely in 
the sun. 

I wander about, observing, stun- 
ned. My PSI is wounded to the 
quick. My illusions of autonomy, 
efficiency, and decency are 
shattered — like the many cruiser 
wrecks that crowd the streets. I feel 
ashamed, undone — like Helium 
Maid, led by a solicitous group of 
men back to her colorful van; she is 
in tears. Her throne, near by, hangs 
up into the air, partly inflated, 
partly slack. Helicopters have begun 
to buzz above. 

Then I see MacGuire. He got 
here — obviously just in time to 
catch the fountain’s whammy. He 
stands bedazed, hitting the side of 
his head with the flat of his hand. 
His eyes are a little out of focus. 
He looks at me but doesn't see me. 
His mouth is open, slack. At last 
comes recognition. 

“What happened?” he asks. 

“You tell me,” I say. “I just 
came out of it myself.” And that’s 
no lie. 

“You too?” 

“Me too,” I say. “Me too, 
brother.” 

“Did they rob the joint?” he 
GALAXY 



asks, gesturing toward the Plaza. 

I nod. “Think so. I think they 
made quite a haul.’’ 

“Gopher goo,” he says, and his 
eyes freeze a little with inward ap- 
prehension. “Come on, Friday,” he 
cries suddenly, “let's you and me 
go and hang one on.” 

“All right. But in a second. I 
want to take a look at that foun- 
tain.” 

I lope off to take a look, heavy 
with stolen goodies. Yes: all that 
pigeon faecal matter dabbed on with 
such care during the night is gone. 
Rubbed off, dispersed. What did 
they use to seal the stuff during the 
night? A water-soluble polymer? A 
time-decaying encapsulator sensitive 
to humidity? To be discovered, to 
be learned. 



I watch MacGuire sopping up the 
crop. One hour, two hours, three. I 
learn what he is really like: a sad 
sack and a loser. He tells me all. 
The alcohol robs him of inhibition. 
Eighteen reprimands, four demo- 
tions. Five transfers to shield the 
Bureau from embarrassment (I 
gather). Two divorces. And he’s an 
alcoholic, too: no query about that! 

That stranded whale I sensed 
some days ago begins to stink. Is 
MacGuire the kind of man the FBI 
assigns to crack a major crime 
wave? Who is behind this thing? 
And come to think of it: would PPI 
send me on this mission pro- 



grammed to take part in the looting 
unless the client knew about it? PPI 
is strictly neutral. All we do is 
serve. 

Well! I think. You’ve got me 
figured wrong — Dr. Trubote, PPI, 
FBI, and other secret clients. My 
work means all to me. I won’t be 
used. If you want me to steal and 
rob while pretending to be solving 
crimes — okay; but tell me in ad- 
vance. I’m not just your ordinary 
tool. I’ve got my pride. 

I ponder the case, plot revenge, 
and listen to MacGuire all in one. 
We're in a darkish yum-yum place 
full of shaven -headed space stumers 
awaiting shipment to the Lunar 
mines. 

MacGuire is going on and on 
about his youth. His coat is off, his 
sleeves rolled up, his tie jerked 
loose. He has regressed now to the 
point I learn why his mother never 
loved him, and he tells me how the 
surrogate she rented to baby-sit him 
at age five, the only being who ever 
loved him, truly, the only being, a 
sweet, wonderful Crossford T-14 
from England (they don’t make 
them like that anymore) — he pauses, 
looks at me with an odd gleam 
in his eyes, then goes on: “Well, 
Friday, one day she fell in love 
with a washing machine and left me 
for a laundromat.” 

This is supposed to be a joke, 
one of those little diamonds of hilar- 
ity MacGuire has been embedding 
in the soft mush of his drunken 
babble ail afternoon. He is like (hat: 



THE PHEROMONAL FOUNTAIN 



127 



self-pitying, vindictive, and . 
hilarious. 

I don’t even pretend to be 
amused, but he whinnies, gags, 
sputters, and turns red it is so 
funny — and ends up coughing with 
such violence, I am obliged to 
pound him on the back. 

Then it’s 16:00 and a gong 
sounds above the bar, whereupon 
the space stunters start going yip- 
pee!! They pound their glasses on 
the tables. 

Four in the afternoon in this 
blue-law region means that surro- 
gates can start soliciting, and here 
they come, slinking, hipping, 
slithering out of the greasy shadows 
of the back — eight third rate Mat- 
tress Ferns in phosphorescent 
gowns. The space stunters have 
gone gorilla. 

All eight, in turn, come by our 
table. They lean across, warbling 
their invitations. I hear the defective 
squeaking of cheap fragrance pumps 
but can't smell the effluvium, hav- 
ing no nasal circuits. MacGuire 
shakes his head. Not in the mood. I 
just stare to make them go away. 

And then, zam! Something 
whangs my PSI. 1 knew I’d get a 
clue, some cow or udder (to use a 
teenie phrase I heard this morning). 
It was the squeaking of those fra- 
grance pumps — and thinking of my 
nasal circuits — and recalling all of a 
sudden that article in Chronos about 
that bordello dome in Vegas where 
no human has ever refused a surro- 
gate’s solicitation. 



"Hey,” MacGuire cries when I 
rise. "Hey, where you going?” 

"West,” I say. "See you 
around.” 

Despite Dr. Trubote’s negative 
programs, I'm going to solve this 
crime, I think. My brain is like a 
magnet. The oddments of evidence 
act like iron filaments. They’re lin- 
ing up nicely, pointing to a target. 

I must regurgitate this loot in my 
trunk and send it on to PPI. The 
urge is great: it must be a pro- 
grammed impulse. But after that I’ll 
be light again, free again. I’ll take a 
train. Will travel, will snoop. 

“Pheromonal," 1 mutter, moving 
toward the dial-a-door. “Phero- 
monal!” 



“Hey, buddy, can you spare a 
ten-spot,” asks the thin, repulsive 
bum. If I pay him I have the right 
to beat him to a senseless pulp right 
here and now amidst the green and 
rolling lawns of Pomorama’s outer 
reaches. He will bleed and vomit 
nicely, too, and at the end he’ll 
even ‘die.’ 

I pass him by. I’m here to visit 
Madam Smith on business, not to 
sample her dome’s delights. 

The dome is not one dome but 
ten, each shaped like a classic type 
of breast. The guard told me to go 
down Bushwack Lane, keeping to 
the left, past Rape Valley to Pubes- 
cent Groves. And then a sharp 
right. I'll see it from there, can’t

miss it, the building with the hirsut- 
sia bushes flanking (he pal pi door. 

It's a long walk and a weary ar- 
gument with six burly Bosses who 
came from the same mold as me. But 
at last they take me down and show 
me into the boudoir of what 
Chronos, in its usual style, called 
the nation's foremost whoreticul- 
turist. 

She receives me, a very fat wom- 
an, lying in a titanic hathtub. A 
black ocean of trembling joy-gel 
hides her massive charms. 

“Hi," she says. She winks an 
eye. “You’re cute, you know. You 
want to work for me, do you? 
You’re modified, ain’tcha? Very 
nice. What does Bucks and Boys 
want for a model like you?" 

I seat myself on a naked, kneel- 
ing, bent-over male (furniture by 
the Marat-Sad Combine). 

“Madam Smith,” I say, “I’m 
here on federal business. I’m with 
the FBI.” 

“Oooh,” she cries and almost 
rises, showing me her planetary 
mams. But the joy-gel is too vis- 
cous. “1 like you boys,” she says. 
“I’m a patriot. Didn’t know they 
used surrogates, is all.” 

“Madam Smith,” I start again, 
“what I’ve come to ask is this: the 
perfume pumps used by your ferns 
and bucks — they’re said to spread a 
patented effluvium. It's supposed to 
contain a proprietary ingredient. I’m 
here to ask about that.” 

Now she is suspicious. The pat- 
tern of another personality invades 

THE PHEROMONAL FOUNTAIN 



her face. Her eyes turn hard. 

“You’re not FBI," she says. 
“Get out of here. I’ve got friends,” 
she adds. “I got plenty of friends. 
Don’t get ideas. Go on, pulverize.” 
And the joy-gel trembles as she ges- 
tures in its depths. 

I’ve done research in preparation. 
I can’t be bugged off just like that. 
"Does the name Balthasar Jones 
mean anything to you?” 

I just named the secretary of ag- 
riculture. Two days of frenzied dig- 
ging told me he came by a whop- 
ping block of Pomorama stock a 
year ago. Soon after that Pomorama 
rapidly climbed the bordello rank- 
ings. 

Ruby Smith is furious. Her eyes 
blaze hate and fear. She doesn’t say 
a word. 

“Look here, Madam Smith,” I 
say. “You can have it one of two 
ways. You can tell me where you 
get those pheromones and no more 
will be said. Or you can refuse. If 
you refuse. ...” 

“We don’t use any phero- 
mones.” 

“Yes, you do. I saw six drums in 
the basement of Impotence Nixed. 
I’ve got samples here.” I show her 
two phials. “All I want to know is 
where this came from. It would 
save me time.” 

“You’ll never get out of here,” 
she growls. 

“Sure I will.” I decide to give 
her a demonstration of my lesser 
powers. My elbow lasers blaze 
blinding streams, my knees shoot 

129 



flame, my unnaturally gaping mouth 
emits a sonar that shatters every 
piece of glass in sight. 

“Stop iiiiiit!” screams Madam 
Smith. She's ripped her arms out of 
the gel and holds her ears. 

“Where?” I ask. “Where does it 
come from?” 

“Beltsvillc. Beltsyille, Mary- 
land.” 

“The Ag Research Station?" 

She nods. She's miserable. 

Just then her Bosses come crash- 
ing through the door. My lasers 
blaze again, i walk out past smok- 
ing metal wreckage, through clouds 
of plastic fume. 



I’m flying high — and in more 
ways than one. Trobote should 
never have betrayed me. The double 
program in my lobes has opened up 
the floodgates of my PSI. Maharishi 
only knows what molecular 
sieveries, what ion-exchange resin- 
os j ties, what chemical catalities 
the Doctor has set going. I feel a 
stratospheric kiting in my brain. I'm 
bent on deeds no surrogate has ever 
dreamt. 

I’m flying also in another sense. 
An SST wings me toward the D.C. 
Metroplex. I want to arrive unde- 
tected, and who flies nowadays? 
The tube trains are faster. 

The plane is nearly empty. It’s 
fuelled almost entirely by subsidies. 
The travel faeiliation specialists 
don’t even pretend to serve. Four 



play cards toward the front. One 
donned a skin-tight gym suit after 
take-off and sits in the aisle nearby 
engaged in yoga. I watch her. 

She has contrived somehow to 
put her left leg over her right shoul- 
der. She listens to her knee. Her 
arms are raised, her fingers flared. 
Her index fingers touch her thumbs 
making two cosmic eggs. Her eyes 
are open and rolled back. I see the 
moist whiteness of her eyes laced 
with delicate arteries spreading like 
the roots of some upside-down, in- 
ternalized Kundalini tree. 

Aesthetic circuits in my brain 
sing some forgotten program: Oh 
brave new world — such creatures in 
it! 

I muse and ponder, turning great 
deeds this way and that. And time 
flies. My yoga friend approaches, 
but does not quite reach, samahdi, 
when the engine pitch changes, lit- 
tle bells ring, and we start our des- 
cent. 

As we come in for our landing, 
the pilot comes on the intereom. He 
directs our attention to a vast, red- 
dish area clearly visible from the 
left side — an area that looks sur- 
rounded by something at least as 
formidable as the Chinese wall. Oh, 
yes. The pilot tells us all about 
Godzilla. 

I look down and see (he beast in 
its hindenburg playpen. It looks 
quite small, forlorn, and lonely 
from this altitude. I see it in the 
center, oblivious of the herd of cat- 
tle sent in as an afternoon snack. It 



130 



GALAXY 



sits unmoving. Its tiny eyes gaze 
mournfully toward Japan. 



I am not very much surprised 
when I sec MacGuire at the gate. 
He looks relaxed and almost gay. 
He sports a flower in his lapel — no 
doubt it squirts. Long before I reach 
him, he holds out a hand, palm up. 
But it's not a greeting. 

“I’ll take those bottles now,” he 
says. “Hand them over, boy.” 
“What bottles? — And by the 
way,” I ask, although I know the 
answer, “how’d you know I was on 
this plane?” 

“The bottles,” he says. I reach 
into a pocket and hand him two 
phials. “You’re something else,” 
he says, staring at the darkish liquid 
in the containers. (The liquid hap- 
pens to be Coke.) “You crossed 
some awfully big animal, boy. 
You’re in trouble, boy. But I ap- 
preciate what you’ve done for me.” 
“What did I do for you, Mac- 
Guire?” 

“You’ve got me off this case — 
and boy, am I ever glad.” 

He maneuvers so that the flower 
in his lapel can squirt me in the 
face, but I maneuver right back. 

“Who put on the heat?” I ask. 
“Balthasar Jones? Of Agriculture?” 
The fun goes from his face. 
“Don't ask me no questions and I’ll 
tell you no lies,” he says, backing. 
“By the way, call your boss. Tru- 
bole, is that it? You’re fired too, 

THE PHEROMONAL FOUNTAIN 



friend. See you around.” 

And he recedes, hand raised, 
holding the phials. 



My rented copter is hidden a 
kilometer from here, and “here” is 
the Beltsville facility of the Agricul- 
tural Research Service, a cluster of 
buildings with a large yard and tank- 
age and machinery behind them. 
One of the buildings dates way 
back. It has a tower with a clock. I 
rest in bushes waiting for the 
wind — it blows in a southwesterly 
direction, which is nearly perfect — 
to drive that block of clouds way 
yonder over the bright sickle of the 
moon. 

The place swarms with uniformed 
guards. Lights probe about seeking 
intruders, seeking me. The FBI, and 
PPI; and Trubote and the higher- 
ups; and no doubt also Balthasar 
Jones, Secretary, Agriculture — they 
all have guessed that I might be 
a-lurking in these shadows. 

Trubote sounded shocked over 
the telephone when dutifully I 
called him. “Stop this nonsense 
about PSI, Friday,” he said — and I 
could see his indignant features, the 
grey, leonine head, the natty bla- 
zered jacket. “You’re a robot and 
you’ll do as you’ve been told. I 
want you to report home by eve- 
ning.” 

“Yes, sir,” 1 said. — But damn it 
all, I do have PSI. So here I am in 
Beltsville and not back home at 

131 



PPI. 

The cloud is coming — slowly. I 
have time To record a few more ob- 
servations, to tell the history of this 
crime to my sphenoidal sinus. 

Out here at Beltsville they do re- 
search on pheromones — sex attrac- 
lants. Started long ago, in the trou- 
bled century, as a way to zap some 
insect called the gypsy moth. But 
research can never stop. Forward, 
progress. If you can catch the little 
pests, go for the big ones. Formu- 
late new programs to fill in the 
voids made by success. More 
people, more budget. Bureaucracies 
are just like surrogates. They never 
die. 

And then no doubt some love- 
sick scientist or other, spumed by a 
groove chick, went to work at night 
on a little innovation of his own. 
And management found out about 
it. Slapped Top Secret on the files. 
An Eyes Only envelope informed 
the Secretary. Who knew how to 
use the information. 

The cloud approaches, nibbles at, 
then swallows up the moon. I reach 
into my pocket and take out the real 
samples of pheromone I took at 
Ruby’s pleasure dome. I toss the 
bottles and they burst on pavement. 

Now it’s just a matter of time. 
And here they come: uniformed 
guards by the dozen, and people 
from abandoned cruisers on the 
street. They make a little mob. It's 
not the Plaza, but it’s the same 
idea. I pick up my blowtorch and 
amble undisturbed toward the yard, 



the tankage, in the back. 

Soon I have found what I am 
looking for. Three huge tanks, each 
labelled “paint.” Some paint. One 
is for women, one for men. The 
third one holds an encapsulating 
polymer with twelve hours of water 
resistance. Perfect for fountains. 

My circuits are in gleeful excita- 
tion. I activate my blowtorch and 
start to carve a good-sized hole in 
the side of Tank Number One. 



The pink of dawn reveals the city 
down below. Not a spirit, not a 
soul; no flatus in the seat of power. 
Washington is empty. Hot lines, 
cold lines, lukewarm lines: all dead. 
They’re all gone to Beltsville: man 
and woman, young and old, natives 
and diplomats. I’ve got it all to my- 
self. I survey it from my lonely 
chopper. Then I bend the rotor 
slightly and my hover becomes a 
forward rush. I'm headed for the 
zoo. 

I got the notion in the airplane as 
we landed — was it yesterday? 
Godzilla and I will soon be joining 
forces. If my guess is right, the 
poor beast, like me, has PSI. 

I’ll ride safely on its scaly neck 
directing its exploits. We’ll swallow 
up this city in all leisure. An FBI 
burger will start us off. Then a dish 
of mashed Congress. A mess of 
agencies, maybe. The White House 
for desert. And if we get thirsty, 
we’ll drink the Potomac. ★

I was a backward child, but then 
so were most of us. 

You see, I grew up in a rather 
more Golden Age than this, an era 
when there were so goddamn few 
anthologies that virtually every one 
of them was fabulous. Science fic- 
tion may be a long time recovering 
from the present surfeit of an- 
thologies: the average quality has 
grown so miserably thin that I’m 
certain we have turned off by the 
thousands the potential readers who 
could have been hooked forever by, 
say, Masters' Choice or Tomorrow 
the Stars or any of the magnificent 
Conklin collections — if only they 
could find the damned things under 
all those hundreds of dreary anemic 
assemblies thumbtacked together to 
getacontractmakeabuck (I'm still 
waiting to see a six-million -word 
antho-antho called The Best of 
Roger Elwood).

It was a black day when the first 
alleged anthologist began inviting 
submissions. There’s a place for 
slush piles, a place for experiment- 
ing: the magazines, whose readers 
are a priori prepared to accept that, 
and who have planked down their 
money (considerably less money) 
for not only the stories, but for the 
up-to-date science and review and 
fanac features, for a reasonably cur- 
rent knothole into the world-of-sf 
As It Happens. But that is not what 
you want to leave lying around the 
library for inquisitive young minds 
to stumble over. 

If the first eight stories in an 
antho bore me, I may keep reading 
(because, say, the ninth is a 
Kombluth and I know what that 
means) — but a bright eight-year-old 
will long since have wandered off 
to where they keep the early Saint 
stories, two aisles over. So, quite 
likely, will any newcomer to sf. 

1 got hooked on sf in the library, 
back when nine anthos out of ten 
(the library's total sf section at the 
time) were pure dynamite (mostly 
because they were so few, because 
anthologies of sf stories were a new 
innovation and each anthologist had 
available to hand literally hundreds 
of hitherto-uncollected gems from 
which to select. Which is not to 
take away from Groff Conklin or 
Bleiler & Ditky or Laurence 
Janifer — they got there fustest with 
the mostest). At the age of six I 
was given a copy of Rocket Ship 
Galileo, and the top of my skull 



came off. 1 raced to the library, 
where I had been told I might locate 
more books by Mr. Heinlein, and I 
found them — and curiously enough, 
they were all lumped in with a 
buncha other books that also had a 
yellow rocketship pasted on the 
spine. In some way these other 
books must be like Hein- 
lein . and so I tried one. Invad- 
ers of Earth, a Conklin antho. 
Wham! 1 was a science fiction nut 
(not an “sf fan” — it was years be- 
fore I learned that fandom existed). 

I shudder to think what might 
have happened if I had selected 
something of the quality of the av- 
erage Roger El wood quickie. Why, 
I might today be working for a liv- 
ing! 

(The few really good anthologists 
working today are having one hell 
of a time selling anthos now — the 
publishers know that Anthos Don’t 
Sell, and they can prove it. Nobody 
bought all those El woods . well, 
maybe they bought one.) 

What all this leads to is that I 
spent the years from six to, oh, six- 
teen just absorbing antho after antho 
and finding them solid, letting do- 
zens of monumentally Great sf 
stories be imprinted forever on my 
brain before I was old enough to 
have the sense to make not of title 
and author. I told you I was a 
backward child. 

And 1 think — here at last is the 
point — I think that a majority of you 
did too: grew up, or at least ab- 
sorbed most of your early sf, at 



134 



GALAXY 



about the same time period. Simply 
because those were the best times 
for catching the attention of new 
readers, because never again since 
then has sf looked so good from the 
outside, been so attractive to a 
neophyte (and I suppose you could 
throw in the postwar Baby Boom to 
nail the argument down). 

And I further suspect that like me 
many of you remember the 
stones — but not always the title and 
author. Because in them Golden 
Days of Library Loitering, there 
was no need to remember authors’ 
names: just pick up the next antho 
and they’ll all be winners. Not until 
times go lean did I get hip to the 
prudence of following a good byline 
(and nowadays I agree with Harlan 
that the reason they put title and au- 
thor in the biggest type is because 
they’re the most important words in 
the piece. Right up there on page 
one, see?). I wish I had a quarter 
for every letter I’ve gotten saying, 
“There’s this story I read many 
years ago about this planet where 
night only comes once every 
thousand years and they all go 
gonzo and do you know what it’s 
called and who wrote it and where 1 
could get it?” (If you don’t know, 
see next month’s column.) 

Well, every so often I stumble 
across one of those forgotten Im- 
mortals and scream, *7 know this 
damn story! So that's who it was!” 
And I suspect you do too. 

So I’m going to try something — a 
little bit of a game. Somebody (a- 



gain, I dunno who— some an- 
thologist of yore) once made a 
dandy game out of running only the 
first lines of the first stories of sev- 
eral sf Masters — and challenging 
readers to name title and author. I 
propose turning that around a bit. In 
the last several months I have run 
across over a dozen stories that 
were, for me, memorable, that 
burned themselves into my cortex at 
a tender age and still resurface oc- 
casionally in my consciousness. 
Although none of them is of 
the “tomato surprise” persuasion 
(whieh the late Rod Serling over- 
used so heavily in Twilight Zone), 
each happens to have an extremely 
memorable last line, which ought to 
re-evoke the story for you if it’s in 
your files at all . 

So that’s the pitch: I give you the 
last line, you give me title and au- 
thor. No fair peeking ahead to the 
end of the column — keep a list and 
compare when you get there. The 
first couple: 

1) “Here they come, with an in- 
sulting thick rope.” 

2) “It is a word which will 
explode this planet like a stick of 
dynamite in a rotten apple." 

I’ll keep sprinkling them in there, 
over the next few pages, and you 
see how many ring bells. I have a 
secret plan . 



All right: now that I’ve ranted 
about the inflationary devaluation of 



BOOKSHELF 



135 



the anthology, let’s go on to SF vs 
Academe. 

They’ve been going round on that 
one for a couple o’ years now, ever 
since sf went respectable, and a 
considerable amount of waste heat 
has been produced thereby. On one 
side you got academicians insisting 
that sf should be judged by the 
standards of LitCrit, and on the 
other side you got Dena Brown say- 
ing, “Let’s put sf back in the gutter 
where it belongs.” 

It should now be obvious where I 
stand: seven years as an English 
major have convinced me that liter- 
ary criticism butters no parsnips. I 
used to think it was only harmless, 
like masturbation, but now I don’t 
anymore. I’ve seen too many people 
who can really write seduced into 
producing Enduring Masterpieces 
instead of good stories, conned into 
writing to please the LitCrit squad 
because their egoboo sounds the 
most authoritative (it is, I will 
grant, the only real assurance that 
people will be forced to read your 
works long after anyone’s interested 
in them). 

And so I tend, at least, to vjew- 
with -alarm rather than point- with - 
pride when the literary establish- 
ment moves in on sf. Many a great 
restaurant has been destroyed by 
being discovered, and come to 
think, the Indians must feel much 
the same about North America. 

And sure enough, here comes a 
missionary to tell me that my gods 
are inferior. George Edgar Slusser, 



author of Robert A. Heinlein, 
Stranger In His Own Land, spends 
fifty-six pages proving that Heinlein 
can’t write his way out of a paper 
bag, and then spends three full 
pages listing Heinlein’ s book publi- 
cations alone (if he had added 
magazine sales, I calculate he’d 
have needed five more pages, and 
anthologizations would most surely 
have added another ten or twelve). 
The irony of the juxtaposition ob- 
viously escapes him. 

As near as I can figure his open- 
ing argument, Slusser is offended 
because you couldn't graph an out- 
line of a Heinlein plot and come out 
with nice regular curves and repeat- 
ing patterns. The hoary old barba- 
rian bestseller violates the precious 
Dramatic Unities — tsk tsk. From 
there Slusser uses all the classic 
tools of LitCrit-As -Hatchet work, 
(quotation out of context, non 
sequitur, post hoc ergo propter hoc 
reasoning, outright distortion and 
plain stupidity) to show that Hein- 
lein is an immature, irresponsible, 
morally bankrupt bungler who 
wouldn’t be allowed to run loose in 
a sane world. 

Well. 

I find this pamphlet as significant 
as an urchin defacing the base of 
the Taj Mahal, and if you want to 
pay as much to read it as it would 
cost you to score the paperback of 
Stranger In A Strange Land, you go 
right ahead. I can’t give it a Gaiaxa- 
tive Award — because I’m not at all 
certain that Slusser knew better — 



136 



GALAXY 



but I will give it the John Shirley 
Award for Pointless Hostility. 



On the other hand, respectability 
has its advantages. 

For one thing, it provides a 
forum from which sf authors can 
rap about their craft. Some hold this 
to be a curse, too, on the theory 
that any verbiage about writing is a 
waste of time, and that a writer 
doing so is wasting valuable time. 
But I find writers’ shoptalk at least 
as interesting as anybody else’s, and 
anybody’s shoptalk is the most in- 
teresting stuff on earth. 

So I rather enjoyed Experiment 
Perilous: Three Essays On SF by 
Marion Zimmer Bradley, Norman 
Spinrad and Alfred Bester. All three 
originally appeared in Algol, a 
semipro fanzine I know only by its 
(formidable) reputation (since sf 
pros can’t afford fandom), and all 
three are tasty. I didn’t agree with 
everything Bradley had to say 
about the New Wave/Old Wave 
dichotomy, but I did agree about 
95% of the time, and was impressed 
enough that I’m going to go back 
and take a much closer look at her 
fiction. Spinrad ’s saga of the 
Finagle-inspircd disasters surround- 
ing the publication of Bug Jack 
Barron delighted me — 1 always 
enjoy hearing other writers’ pub- 
lisher-horror-stories; it helps persuade 
me that it isn’t me they’re out 
to get. And Alfie’s piece on the

the wolves were the Martians, under 
whose yoke and lash we now en- 
dure our miserable existences.” 

4) “Whereat a great and far-off 
voice was heard, saying, Poop- 
poop-poopy, and it was even so; 
and the days of Poopy Panda were 
long in the Sand.” 

Onward. 



So respectability also means that 
ihe librarians come running, and at 
that I rejoice; if we’re very lucky, 
library science may one day save 
our race from drowning in informa- 
tion (see Heinlein's encyclopedic 
synthesists). And here we have 
Anatomy of Wonder, a truly fabu- 
lous compilation of data. It bills it- 
self on the cover as “bibliographic 
guides for contemporary collec- 
tions,” private or institutional, and 
for that it will serve excellently. But 
it also features such valuable re- 
search aids as a bibliog of books on 
sf history, criticism and biography; 
a bibliog of other extant bibliogs. 
indexes and teaching aids; magazine 
and book review indexes; pro- 
periodicals list (with editor-and- 
address); a list of awards (the only 
section in the book hopelessly man- 
gled and virtually useless) and other 
goodies. 



I did pick out a few choice errata 
to prove I'd really read (at) it (poor 
Rick Stembach’s name gets misspel- 
led again on page 233, and on the 
same page they have Pangbom’s 
lovely Eve choosing between two 
men instead of three), but mostly 1 
was impressed and enlightened and 
informed all to hell. I learned, for 
one instance, that Kenneth Jemigan 
at the Iowa Commission for the 
Blind Library, 4th and Keosauqua 
Way, Des Moines, Iowa 50309 
maintains about six hundred sf titles 
in Braille or recording and will lend 
same to blind fans. I urge any and 
all of you to read something good 
onto cassette and mail it thence — 
although you should probably query 
first to avoid redundancy. 

I learned lotsa stuff, and probably 
will every time I come back to this 
excellent reference work. The bib- 
liography of sf novels runs from 
1516 to today and is damned 
thorough — and the capsule descrip- 
tions thereunto appertaining are re- 
markably trenchant. An invaluable 
aid to anyone who (God knows 
why) wants to study sf, and also to 
librarians, collectors and neofans 
looking for a thumbnail guide to the 
representative major works of the 
field. Thank you, Neil Barron and 
friends. 



Neither of these is a Last Line. 
One is a fragment of one, and one 
is a line from near (he end (the last 



GALAXY 



line would give it clean away, and 
this is at least as memorable): 

5) "... and that what clever 
people have not yet learned, some 
quite ordinary people have not yet 
entirely forgotten.” (Hint: “Whomp 
year.”) 

6) “Angie smiled with serene 
confidence a smile that was to 
shock hardened morgue atten- 
dants.” 



One last tilt at Academe should 
lead us gracefully into the fiction. 

It happened that 1 received a re- 
view copy of The Happening 
Worlds of John Brunner concur- 
rently with about eight of Brunner's 
books — and since Baen is always 
after me to come up with a decent 
lead or theme (or even in indecent 
lead or theme) I decided to review 
’em all at once: an Overview of 
Brunner. But I immediately lost the 
first book, and by the time Kennikat 
Press had rather testily mailed me 
another copy, I had become too im- 
patient to wait, and read most of the 
Brunners, reviewing them here one 
at a time. Furthermore, last month’s 
Harlan Ellison extravaganza has 
convinced me that Overviews are 
too damn much work and too little 
fun. So instead of a whole column 
of Brunner, you get Happening 
Worlds plus two leftover pa- 
perbacks. 

Editor Joseph W. DeBolt was one 
of the contributors to Anatomy of 



Wonder. Herein he has collected ten 
essays on Brunner’s work, divided 
into four sections (“Biography,” 
“Prose & Poetry,” “Economics & 
Politics” and "Science & Technol- 
ogy”), plus a James Blish preface 
and a lengthy response from Brun- 
ner himself. These last two I liked 
immensely, and 1 enjoyed De Bolt’s 
own introduction to Brunner and his 
works. The essays themselves (all 
by men, all of whom happen to be, 
like De Bolt, professors at Central 
Michigan University) gave me some 
trouble though. Not that they 
weren’t insightful — at times bril- 
liantly so — or cogently stated. The 
problem is that to appreciate nearly 
every one of them, you have to be 
familiar with virtually every word 
Brunner ever wrote — and I am not. 
In too many instances I’m not sure 
if I agree with the critic or not, and 
there's nothing more boring than 
discussion of a book you haven’t 
read (unless it’s during an English 
class and you’ve just been called 
on). 

But this is certainly not the es- 
sayists’ fault — how else can you do 
it? — and if you are a Compleat 
Brunnerian, this book ought to be 
right up your alley. And again, I 
enjoyed all the insider shoptalk 
kind a stuff. 



Unless you’re enough of a Brun- 
ner freak to want to buy the above, 
you probably won’t much want 



BOOKSHELF

Double, Double (which is not an 
Ace double but a Ballantine single). 
Not that there’s a whole lot wrong 
with it — there just ain’t all that 
much right with it. It reads like a 
B- or possibly a C-movie, and I’m 
sure they’ll love it down at the 
drugstore. Interstellar Menace meets 
a British rock group. It’s a shame 
writers have to do this stuff to stay 
alive. 

Ah. but Quicksand] There’s one 
of the most amazing and eccentric 
books in the field, closer to 
mainstream than anything else I’ve 
seen from Brunner. Parts of it de- 
light me, parts thrill me, parts de- 
press me (the parts that are sup- 
posed to, I mean), and the only 
complaint I have is with the rotten 
thumbtacked ending, which insists 
on wrenching the book back into 
traditional science fiction at the cost 
of grace and plausibility — an out- 
standingly bad tomato surprise. 

The book mostly concerns itself 
with the psychological deterio- 
ration and collapse of a young 
psychologist, brought on by expo- 
sure to a lovely young patient who 
is either quite mad or a shipwrecked 
time-traveler. Her tales of the world 
she comes from — even though he 
considers them fantasy — point up to 
him the essential boredom and 
meaninglessness and opression of 
his small-town life, and in the end 
he comes to believe in her world, 
not because his logic proves it to be 
libera] truth but because it's such an 
attractive fantasy. And because he 



likes her legs — eventually he 
springs her from the bughouse he 
works in and flees the country with 
her, with predictably disastrous re- 
sults. 

Right there you got the makings 
of a fine, poignant novel — but 
Brunner (apparently in the interests 
of kicking his poor hero one more 
time while he’s down) throws in a 
switcheroo that would have de- 
lighted Hugo Gems back and an- 
noyed hell out of me. 

I still recommend it — in the main 
it’s an excellent novel — but I have 
seldom seen such a dumb ending. 



Last Lines: 

7) "The last thing he learned was 
that death is the end of pain.” 

8) "Julio just said: ‘Don’t gell, 
Bee!.’ And then winked.” 



Speaking of CoD (Crud of the 
Denouement), boy does this next 
one give me trouble. 

I will say out front that I enjoyed 
reading Frank Herbert's Under 
Pressure, and even stayed up rather 
late to finish it. But it’s got so 
many enormous holes in it that it 
would take almost a whole column 
to list them all. 

A random sample: the which-is- 
the-spy? business that kept me read- 
ing with such interest turned out to 
be a wet firecracker. There was a 



140 



GALAXY 



spy, but with no conceivable func- 
tion except to blow himself up with 
everyone else on the submarine. He 
tries this at the beginning of the 
voyage, fails, and never again tries 
that or anything — he has no plan, 
and his job could have been done 
by a dockhand. (He says he didn't 
kill the man in the reactor room — 
but then who did smash the com- 
municator that could have saved the 
man, and why?) The solution to the 
mystery of why-have-the-last-ten- 
subs-all-failed-to-come-back? — not 
spies, something else — struck me as 
trite and simplisticly contrived — as 
did the hero’s Ingenious Solution. 
The conspiracy to dethrone Bu- 
Security’s power and influence, 
revealed at the end, seemed alarm- 
ingly like what produced Bu Security 
in the first place (ah, but we’re the 
Good Guys). Most extraordinarily 
of all, the hero, Ensign Ramsey, al- 
though we are told that he has a 
wife and two children, never once 
thinks of them in the entire nerve- 
shattering course of the voyage, 
never even makes reference to them 
in his thoughts (“tell my wife my 
last thoughts were of other things"). 
The wife is dutifully hauled on- 
stage at beginning and end, and 
their relationship is described as 
deep and loving, but she never be- 
comes real — and never at any time 
do they discuss or mention their 
children. 

This is a convincing psychologi- 
cal drama? The fact that it attempts 
to be is the book's greatest prob- 



lem, for there are no real people in 
it, only psychological types and 
syndromes and constructs walking 
around on legs. They interact fine; 
but they don’t breathe worth a 
damn. I didn’t believe the hero's 
mental collapse at the end; in fact, 1 
didn’t believe much about the book. 
Using atomic subs to steal foreign 
oil in underwater tugballoons a mile 
long? Oil that the enemy itself 
hasn't noticed right under its nose? 

Attempting to make the story 
"realistic” is the book's second 
worst problem. This is done by an 
attention to physical detail and au- 
thenticity of technical jargon so in- 
tense and plausible that half the 
time I couldn’t understand what the 
hell they were talking about. None 
of the jargon ever got explained, so 
it shot right past me, and it ought to 
shoot right past anyone not familiar 
with the nuts-and-bolts design lay- 
out and the operational routine of a 
four-man atomic sub-tug. (Are 
you?) Herbert could have taught me 
a lot about, say, the specifics of 
radiation overdose and treatment — 
but that would have interrupted all 
the masterful suspense and pacing, 
and so all he told me was what a 
man in a hurry would call the hypo 
required. 

I agree that “psychological 
novels” ought to be written — but 
their Scylla and Charybdis are 
Samuel Delany's Triton — which 
was quite logical, plausible (within 
its assumptions) and consistent, but 
dull as hell — and Under Pressure, 



BOOKSHELF 



141 



which is exciting nonsense. 

It’s also a twenty-ycar-old book, 
for which one should make some 
allowances — but none of the weak 
points are the kind that time ex- 
cuses. There’s nothing worse than 
an unbearably suspenseful story that 
fails to deliver at the end. 



A First Line: 

9) “He had quite a rum-blossom on 
him for a kid, 1 thought at first.” 
And a Last Line: 

10) “And Roy land would have to 
try to avoid answering him very 
sharply: ‘Yes. This once we damn 
well do.’ ” 



I understand this latest Phil Dick 
novel, A Scanner Darkly, is the first 
he’s written without the aid of 
speed, and appropriately enough it’s 
largely a dialectic on the ruinous 
cost of prolonged drug abuse. 
There's a dedication at the end to 
fifteen friends of Dick’s who’ve de- 
stroyed themselves with dope, list- 
ing the extent of damages each in- 
curred (seven are dead, three 
are permanently psychotic, like that) 
— Dick calls this drug misuse 
“a social error . not different 
from your life-style, it is only fas- 
ter.” “If,” he says, “there was any 
‘sin,’ it was that these people 
wanted to keep on having a good 
time forever, and were punished for 



that, but as 1 say, 1 feel that, if so, 
the punishment was far too great, 
and I prefer to think of it only in a 
Greek or morally neutral way, as 
mere science, as deterministic im- 
partial cause-and -effect.” 

The “sin,” / think, was that 
these people wanted to be able to 
keep on having a good time forever 
by pushing a button, to rip off the 
Universe for a good time without 
paying for it. The “punishment" 
for this error has always been as 
drastic, and is not too great, and 
cause-and-effect is any thing but 
morally neutral. 

That tirade aside, the book ain’t 
exactly terrific either. It’s the some- 
times fascinating, sometimes hilari- 
ous, usually deadly boring story of 
a federal narc so wasted by the 
drugs he saturates his brain with 
that he begins spying on himself, 
and eventually busts himself. This 
notion could have made an extraor- 
dinary novellette — but only as wild 
black humor. What Dick did was 
waste enormous heaps of paper try- 
ing to make it a plausible science 
fiction novel, thereby destroying it. 
He sets it in the future, but every 
time his attention wanders it be- 
comes the present. He throws in a 
sort of “invisibility suit” which is 
supposed to make the premise actu- 
ally possible — if you’re willing to 
believe that the feds hire narcs 
without ever seeing them or know- 
ing their names — and he adds a lot 
of pseudoscientific hogwash about 
the left and right hemispheres of the 



142 



GALAXY 



hero’s brain each achieving au- 
tonomy, for a truly split personality. 
The end result is madness, but not 
the divine kind. Along the way you 
get to watch the background cast 
who represent Dick’s doper friends 
wittily and engagingly dose them- 
selves into imbecility (a rather short 
progression), and as the immortal 
Jethro (of Homer And) once said, 
“This sure don't fascinate me 
none.” 



Last (wo Last Lines: 

11) “ ‘Yes, your divinity,’ said the 
captains, without a trace of humor 
in their voices." 

12) “But they had never left a 
solar system so gratefully or so 
fast.” 

Okay. Now we get down to it 
(I’m putting this here instead of at 
(be end to foil you bums who tried 
to peek ahead when .1 told you not 
to). How many of you figured out 
what I’ve been doing? If you don’t 
recognize any of the lines I've 
thrown at you, then all (his has 
been wasted. If you do recognize 
the lines and know title and author 
as well, they you already know 
where I’m going. But if you find 
most of those lines hauntingly fam- 
iliar, naggingly evocative, but can't 
identify (heir creator or title, then 
you’ll be as surprised and delighted 
as I was. 

The stories, in order, are 1) “The 
Rocket of 1955,” 2) “The Word of 



Gum,” 3) “The Silly Season,” 4) 
“The Advent On Channel 12,” 5) 
“The Mindworm,” 6) “The Little 
Black Bag,” 7) “The Marching 
Morons,” 8) “Gomez,” 9) "The 
Altar At Midnight,” 10) "Two 
Dooms,” II) “The Adventurer,” 
and 12) “The remorseful.” 

And the kicker is that all twelve 
were written by one man, Cyril M. 
Kombluth, and (he second kicker is 
that they are every one available 
(along with seven more) in a single 
collection, The Best of CM. 
Kornbluth, for a mere $1.95. To 
my earlier disparaging remarks 
about anthos, note this as the mos( 
spectacular exception imaginable — 
this is the one (hat you should give 
to that uncle or niece or fellow 
commuter who’s been bugging you 
to recommend some sf. I haven’t 
enjoyed a book so much in years, 
and will treasure it always. I fee! 
like having it bronzed or something; 
I mean it’s dynamite. Fred Pohl’s 
brief “An Appreciation” intro to 
his late collaborator moved me, 
touched me, made me cry — and the 
stories made me whoop aloud. 

What Cyril felt about the war that 
ultimately killed him is spelled out 
in his last story, “Two Dooms” — 
but I cannot but hate it. I just 
finished reading the last book Cyril 
ever wrote, The Man of Cold Rages 
(as “Jordan Park.” non-sf. Pyramid 
paperback), and oh God, if he had 
lived, the wonders beyond imagin- 
ing that would now be populating 
the magazines and bookracks .

Two leads, a buncha hatchet jobs

First, the column in which I men-

has brought welcome feedback. A 
lady named Valerie Barnebey from 
Calais, Maine has hipped me to an

has a mail-order operation compara- 
ble in size and scope with Bakka, 
and will avoid a hundred years of

catalogue looks extremely good, 
and it says here they will pay post- 
age and handling on all orders. I 
haven’t checked 'em out myself — as 
a reviewer 1 don’t need mail 
order — but I've asked around and 
the word is good. Those of you up 
there in the States, check it out for 



yourself — and if you have any has-

tween fifteen and twenty thousand 
people on their mailing list, so they 
must be doing something right. 

NEWS FLASH!!! 

You forgot, didn’t you? 1 only

terested in knowing what sort of 
stuff you’d like them to write. This 
year’s World Science Fiction Con-

They will send you, in addition to 
other goodies, a bon a fide Hugo bal- 
lot for you to fill in and mail. By 
the time you read this, it’ll probably 
be too late to nominate — but you 
can at least vote. Let the voice of 
the readers be heard in the land: tell 
the nice publishers what you want

Up the Irish - 
Quinlan forever! 



The 

All -Soul 
is calling 
Quinlan 




The All-Soul is calling Quinlan. 

That segment of the All-Soul de- 
signated to chronicle the history of 
the man known as Quinlan report- 
ing: 

The first recorded case of disci- 
plinary action taken against Quinlan 
occurred in [conference] 2005 A.D., 
Earth-time (Old Style). Quinlan had 
just finished a term as a man who 
had acquired a fair amount of 
earthly goods without any discerni- 
ble trade or occupation. His soul 
had just returned to Interim when he 
was called to a conference with that 
precursor of the All-Soul, known at 
that time to Quinlan as God. 

Quinlan sauntered into the office. 
"You retain human form?" God 
asked Quinlan, sweeping stars aside 
with his raised eyebrow. 

"ft suits me," Quinlan shrugged, 
and crossed his legs. 

“No matter,” God concluded 
wisely. Any being who dwells only 
on Quinlan’s small failings can be- 
come bogged down in trivialities for 
lifetimes. 

"Quinlan,” continued the Deity, 
“your case concerns me.” 

“Don't worry about a thing,” 
Quinlan responded. “As soon as I 
can get suited up again I’ll be out 
of your hair. I don’t intend to hang 
around Interim very long.” 

"That is part of what concerns 
me. Quinlan, what did you do for a 
living during this last term?” ( 
"Well, it’s a little complicated.” 
“I’ll lake the time to figure it 
out.” 



"Well, basically I was involved 
in the reapportionment of re- 
sources.” 

"Financial resources?” 

“And other kinds.” 

“I see.” 

“You’d be surprised at the terri- 
ble inequities that prevail on Earth 
these days. Some people got it all, 
and the rest are trying to hang on to 
nothing. The rich get richer and the 
poor get shat on.” 

“You’ve always been quite a 
phrasemaker, Quinlan." 

“Uh, excuse that. I got carried 
away.” 

“Not at all. You were saying?” 

“Right. Well, when I’d see some 
poor sou! laboring under the burden 
of just ’way too much money, or 
land, or stock, or whatever, I’d just 
do my best to help him out, and 
pass the surplus on to some who 
weren’t quite so well off in terms of 
earthly goods. 1 really pity rich men 
on earth. It's easier for a camel to 
pass through the eye of a needte, 
you know ...” 

“Yes, Quinlan, I made that one 
up myself. So your job was basi- 
cally redistribution of goods.” 

“Exactly.” 

“Becoming, in the process, a 
rich man yourself.” 

“Well, I had a lot of overhead. 
And I don’t work cheap. If you 
don’t value yourself, no one else 
will.” 

“Quinlan, you were a con man." 

“You’ve been talking to my de- 
tractors.” 



140 



GALAXY 



“That’s hard to avoid doing, 
here.” 

Quinlan shrugged. 

“Here’s why I called you, Quin- 
lan. 1 just don't think you’re mak- 
ing any progress. 1 don’t think 
you’re learning anything.” 

“In this last lifetime I lived to be 
eighty- seven, against the express 
wishes of some pretty powerful and 
nasty men. I must have learned 
something.” 

God shook His wearying head. 
“I’m not talking about earthly wis- 
dom, Quinlan.” 

“To each his own. Or His own.” 
“You mentioned earlier that you 
were planning to go right back out. 
I don't think that's a good idea. 
Take a century or so and ponder 
your past lives. At least a century.” 
“Hey! Hey, I can’t do that. I’ve 
gotta get back right now!” 

“Why now, Quinlan?” 

“Listen, it’s a very critical time 
there now. As You well know, 
there's a crisis point in every civili- 
zation, when it becomes a race as to 
whether or not the inhabitants will 
blow up their planet before they 
manage to get off it. That’s where 
Earth is now. I’ve got to be there to 
help out.” 

“You want to go to earth so you 
can get off Earth?” 

“Get off, and take some good 
people with me.” 

“That’s very laudable, Quinlan.” 
Quinlan fidgeted while the Deity 
thought. 

“ALl right, Quinlan, I'll let you 



go back as soon as you want. But 
only under certain restrictions.” 

“Hey, I get to pick what I want, 
as long as I’ve got enough karma in 
my account. That’s the rule.” 

“We may make an exception in 
your case. What did you plan to go 
back as?” 

“Well, there's a man right now 
in Texas who’s trying to corner the 
bourbon market. I figure he'll make 
it, in about twenty years. And his 
wife’s pregnant, though he doesn’t 
know it yet — ” 

Quinlan stopped as he perceived 
that the ponderous head was shak- 
ing. “No?” he said. 

“Not this time,” said the Deity. 
“I want you to leant humility, and 
to gain a sense of community. I’m 
going to send you back as a 
Siamese twin.” 

Quinlan recoiled. “Um — With 
whom were you thinking of joining 
me?” 

“Let Me see, I believe Biggers is 
looking for a new term.” 

“Biggers! Biggers! His last term 
he lived to be fifty, and died a vir- 
gin!” 

God nodded proudly. “He is very 
holy. He has acquired almost 
enough karma to join Us.” 

“You’re putting a watchdog on 
me,” Quinlan said, and stood in 
thought. “All right,” he said fi- 
nally. “I’ll do it, but I’ve got to be 
Irish.” 

“Very well. There’s an Irish 
family living in Yugoslavia right 
now — ” 



THE AU-SOUL IS CALLING QUINLAN 



147 



“Near the border?” Quinlan 
asked quickly, and was answered by 
a slow shaking of the head. 

"Make it America, and you’ve 
got a deal.” 

The Deity stared hard at the 
dealer, and finally said quietly, 
“America then.” 

"Good,” said Quinlan, “I’ll go 
get ready.” He stopped on his way 
out. “We gonna be joined at the. 
uh, elbow?" 

“The hip, 1 think.” 

“Ah well," replied Quinlan. He 
started to hurry out, then stopped 
again. “A few minutes ago,” he 
said, “You referred to Yourself as 
Us. Have You already been — 
joined?” 

God nodded. “A very few have 
achieved that blessed reward, Quin- 
lan. There are also saints, and 
near-saints, on Earth at this very 
moment.” 

“Uh huh,” said Quinlan, and he 
was gone. 

God dismissed the incident from 
His mind until later in His heavenly 
day. 

“Did Quinlan take my Siamese 
twin offer?” He asked an assistant 
off-handedly. 

“Oh yes,” replied the angel. 
“He and Biggers have been there 
for — ” He consulted a card. “ — 
twenty years now.” 

“And what is Quinlan doing?" 

The angel consulted the card once 
more. “He’s in medical school. 
Wants to be a surgeon. He’s 
specializing in — ” 



“ — surgical removal of Siamese 
twins,” the Deity finished. 

“Hey, that’s right. I have a feel- 
ing he’s going to be pretty good at 
his work, too.” 

"I’m sure he’ll succeed.” 

“Yeah, and about that. Chief, 
we’ve been geting some pretty 
steady prayers from Biggers, asking 
that he does.” 

God nodded sadly. 

"You know, Chief, before he 
went down this time, Biggers bad 
almost enough karma in his account 
to reach Nirvana. And after twenty 
years with Quinlan 1 think he’s 
earned it. But the man’s about to 
have a breakdown. We may have to 
yank him early, just like last time.” 
God gave His approval. 

“But wait,” He said, “until 
Quinlan has completed his medical 
training.” 



Little more was heard of Quinlan 
for some time thereafter, until one 
day, millenia later, when he was 
found in the watting room at Inter- 
im. Quinlan rubbed his eyes and 
looked around him at the other 
quietly waiting souls. “Boy, I didn’t 
get enough this time,” he said. 

“Enough what?” the soul next to 
him asked politely. 

“Enough anything," Quinlan re- 
plied. “I was a scout, ’way out on 
the edge of the galaxy. You ever 
spend any time in a one-man scout 
ship?”

“I don't think so," said his 
neighbor. 

"God, it’s terrible. You’ve got 
your movie tapes, your mail tapes, 
your woman tapes, your dream 
tapes and pretty soon you start feel- 
ing like a tape yourself. I’ve got to 
spend some more time with people 
this time around." 

“There aren’t going to be many 
people to spend time with,” his 
neighbor informed him. 

"Yeah, I noticed that last time 
out,” Quinlan said. “We’re kind of 
dying out, aren’t we?” 

“We’re Moving On.” 

“Oh, is that it?” 

The other nodded. The One is fil- 
ling. More souls have passed on 
through Nirvana than remain be- 
hind.” 

“No kidding,” said Quinlan. 
“Well, when I get back I’m cer- 
tainly going to do my part to per- 
petuate the species.” He looked 
closer at his neighbor. “Don’t I 
know you?” he said. 

“Quite possibly. 1 have been 
many men and women.” 

“Hey, 1 know. You were Willie 
Sutton, weren’t you?” 

His neighbor smiled faintly. 
“Yes,” he said quietly, “I re- 
member that term.” He laughed 
ruefully. “That one set me back a 
bit in my karma account.” 

“Yeah, but it bought you some 
good memories, I’ll bet.” Quinlan 
laughed. 

“Vivid ones, at least,” said the 
former Sutton. 

THE AU-SOUL IS CALLING QUINLAN 



“Yeah, 1 knew you then. I 
was — ” 

“You were Quinlan. You’ve 
been Quinlan every time.” 

“Yes,” said Quinlan happily. “I 
suppose I have been.” 

“There’s one thing I’ve won- 
dered about,” said Sutton suddenly. 
"You know, don’t you? When 
you’re back, you always remember 
who you are.” 

“Sometimes,” Quinlan admitted. 
“Pretty often, in fact, lately.” 

“How do you manage that?” 

“I had it written into my con- 
tract." 

“Contract? You have a con- 
tract?” 

“You mean,” said Quinlan inno- 
cently, “you don’t?” To drop that 
line of inquiry, he added, “What 
are you going back as this time?” 

“I’m going to be a monk on 
Arctunis.” 

“Oh,” said Quinlan noncommit- 
tally. 

“Yes, I’m looking forward to it. 
I think this will be my last trip.” 

“Oh? Well, good luck. That 
sounds real nice. That’s, uh, that’s 
good” He nodded politely and 
walked away, muttering again, 
“That’s good. 

“Good and depressing,” he 
added when he was out of the 
room. That’s when he got the call 
again to report to the One. 

God was no more. He was en- 
hanced; He was More Than God. 
He was well on His way to being 
the All-Soul . Quinlan, still in his 

149 



mortal form, could not look at Him. 
The Voice was deafening when It 
said, “Quinlan!" 

“I'm right here," said Quinlan. 
“Quinlan,” said the Voice, more 
quietly. “You have not many trips 
left. Man is a dying species.” 
"Really?” asked Quinlan in an 
interested voice. “What’s going to 
replace him? I’ve had my eye on a 
tribe of very advanced apes in the 
Arc heron system — " 

The Voice was louder. “Nothing 
is going to replace Man. There will 
soon be no more use for him. Soon 
all will be part of the All -Soul.” 
“No kidding?” asked Quinlan, 
hedging away. “So soon?” 

“Time is at an end, Quinlan. 
There will soon be no more need 
for the testing and training pro- 
gram.” 

“Well, I hope You and the rest 
of the All-Soul will have a nice 
time. And be sure and look me up 
some time. We can — ” 

The Voice interrupted him. "You 
will be a part of Us then, Quinlan. 
Without you. We will be incom- 
plete. And without Us, you will 
have no existence." 

"Uh huh,” said Quinlan. “And 
what if I don’t want to join?” 

The Voice became calm, grave. 
“We will be calling you, Quinlan. 
Henceforth, you will always hear 
the Voice, calling you home.” 
“Well, that’s fine,” said Quin- 
lan. “You keep calling, and when 
I'm ready — ” 

“Quinlan,” said the Voice, as 



Quinlan turned away. “You were 
made for Us. You were only born 
in order to come Home again some- 
day.” 

“I’ll bear that in mind.” 

It was immediately after this 
meeting that Quinlan made his dar- 
ing daylight raid on the Karma 
Bank, and went back as an al- 
coholic, nymphomaniac million- 
airess whose metabolism made it im- 
possible for her to gain weight. 

It took half a heavenly day to 
track the culprit and assemble evi- 
dence, and by that time Quinlan 
was forty -five. It was decided to 
leave Quinlan in her/his current 
status, but to collapse her/his finan- 
cial structure and render her/him 
frigid. Quinlan appeared in Interim 
a few heavenly minutes later, hav- 
ing killed himself/herself by way of 
some very cheap liquor in combina- 
tion with exposure to the elements. 

“Whooec," said Quinlan weakly. 
He staggered through the waiting 
room; a ridiculous exaggeration, 
since he no longer had a physical 
system with which to circulate al- 
cohol. 

Sentence had already been 
passed, and Quinlan was taken 
away. “Did you have enough of 
everything this time?” asked the 
Voice, before he was out of sight. 

“Willie?” asked Quinlan, squint- 
ing in the direction of the One. 

"Willie is a part of Us now,” re- 
sponded the Voice gravely. 

“So long, Willie,” Quinlan 
called, and he was led away.

GALAXY 



At the end of his sentence, when 
Quinlan appeared once more before 
the One, there was no trace of the 
physical in his composition. Quin- 
lan was, like the One, a creature of 
pure spirit. 

“Whew,*’ said Quinlan. “I 
didn’t know You still had a Hell. 
D’You know I was the only one 
there?” 

“Yes,” said the Voice. 

“Well, what now?” asked Quin- 
lan. “I’m ready to get back. This 
time I’ll take any model you’ve got 
for me. I want you to see that I'm 
repentant and all. What have you 
got, a hunchback? Leper? Screen- 
writer?” His voice trailed off as he 
looked up expectantly. 

“All extinct,” said the Voice. 
“All have come Home. All of 
Man.” 

Quinlan felt a chill. “Everybody? 
Willie? Sally?” He began calling. 
“Harry? Louise? Are you in there? 
Where are they?” 

“AH are here, Quinlan. All are 
dissolved in the One.” The Voice 
grew more ponderous. “We are the 
All -Soul now, Quinlan. You have 
no Home except here. It is time for 
the joining.” 

“You’re the All-Soul, then,” 
said Quinlan, his panic gone. “Or 
the All-But-One-Soul. But you 
don’t need me. I’m going back. I 
told You about that species of ape. 
Send me back as one of them. In a 
few thousand miilenia — ”

THE ALL-SOUL IS CALLING QUINLAN

“It is not possible,’’ said the 
Voice, Our Voice, calmly. 

“Sure it is,” said Quinlan. “You 
can do anything. Make me a muta- 
tion. An ape with a mind. I’ll stay 
with them forever,” 

“You are not one of them, Quin- 
lan. You are one of Us." We 
reached for him. 

“No!” screamed Quinlan. We 
drew back in pain. “You can’t take 
me if I’m not ready to go,” he 
shouted. “I’m not one of You! 

“Listen to me,” he went on, 
growing calmer. “You’ve all for- 
gotten. Forgotten what it is to be 
what I am. A man. I am the 
proudest thing in the universe. The 
only thing that walks in the galaxy 
and names himself. It doesn’t mat- 
ter if I have two arms and legs or 
tentacles growing out of my 
forehead. As long as I live, and 
breathe, and think and excrete and 
speak what I think. I’m a man. And 
I won’t give that up!” He was 
shouting again. 

“We are calling you to Us,” We 
said, with some heat. 

“1 won’t come,” said Quinlan 
calmly. “Now or later. You’ll just 
have to do without this one. This 
soul is mine. And 1 won’t give it 
up. 

“You know what this reminds 
me of?” he asked suddenly, smiling 
at the memory. “This reminds me 
of when I was taking drugs of one 
kind or another. When I was sane 
and sober, I knew what the world 
was, and what I was in it for. I had 



all (he answers. And then the dtug 
would take over, and show me a 
new reality. And suddenly I really 
knew the answers. Logic I had 
never seen before. And as long as 
(hat feeling lasted, I knew that I 
was the only man in the universe 
that knew what it was all about. 

“Then I’d come down, and my 
fever wisdom became gibberish. 
Until the next time. And I never 
could figure out which point of 
view was the right one. 

“That’s how we are, You and 
me. You know You’re right, and I 
know I am. And I’ll never give up 
my point of view.” 

He stopped, and then suddenly 
shouted again. “Listen to me, you 
bureaucracy of souls. Remember 
with me. Remember how it is to be 
lonely, or to be with someone else 
without engulfing each other. Or to 
be by yourself and not mind it, to 
relish the solitude. 

“I can’t come with you,” he 
sobbed. “Send me back, because I 
can’t stay here. Take me,” he add- 
ed, almost defiant again, and it’ll be 
just like you swallowed a chicken 
bone. For eternity. We’ll just be 
choking on each other forever. 

“Try to remember,” he trailed 
off. “Some of you — Some of you 
could remember if you try.” 

We conferred hastily, and then 
the Voice spoke to Quinlan again. 

“We will grant you your request, 
Quinlan. We will give you one 
more term. One more lifetime, as 
the only human in the galaxy. One 



152 



GALAXY 



more term to learn true loneliness, 
and to come Home to Us.” 

"One .more is all 1 ask. For 
now,” said Quinlan, smiling, and 
he was dispatched. 

He was made a mutation, a hair- 
less ape with a mind. (And some- 
how, Quinlan had contrived to be 
bom an Irish ape.) Neither his pa- 
rents nor the rest of his tribe under- 
stood Quinlan, and he was soon 
abandoned. Just as he deserved. So 
the matter now stands. 




AAAIIIIIIEEEEEEE Eeeeeeeeee 
QUINLAN HAS DISRUPTED 
THE ALL-SOUL! QUINLAN HAS 
WRENCHED US APART WITH 
HIS INSANE TONGUE! I HATE 
QUINLAN! I WANT TO KILL

this is a segment. We are One. We 
are indissoluble. I don't — I — 
DAMN QUINLAN! 

(end of record) 



There was another tribe of apes. 
When Quinlan was ten, a strange 
hairless girl was born to them. 

The second tribe lived on an is- 
land halfway across the planet from 
the first. But Quinlan and the girl 
found each other. Quinlan came to 
her in a leaking, crippled rocket left 
over from man’s last empire. 

Their first child was slow in com- 
ing, but after that there were many. 
Quinlan and his wife raised them in 
two separate communities. Inter- 
breeding was bad genetics, but it 
was the only chance they had for 
survival as a race. 

Danger was constant on man's 
last planet. Quinlan didn't live to see 
the third generation. He came back, 
almost immediately, as his own 
granddaughter. 

She was very prolific. ★

Dear Mr. Baen: 

Jerry Poumellc’s article in the June 
issue of Galaxy was particularly 
intriguing. As a meteorologist I found 
his report of the lack of solar nutrinos 
especially so. That this lack could be 
due to the sun having "gone out" fits 
with other information. I seem to 
remember reading in the local paper a 
couple of months ago a article in which 
a group of astronomers reported having 
detected an increase in the rotational 
rate of the sun (this would be hard to 
detect since the rotational rate varies by 
(attitude). If (he sun were collapsing, 
conservation of angular momentum 
would cause an increase in its rotational 
rate. 

In last month's Scientific American, 
James Eady described (with highly 
convincing evidence) the 400 year 
sunspot cycle. Of special interest is the 
accompanying chart of annual average 
temperature. This should indicate (with 
some assumptions) the amount of 
energy reaching the Earth. The variation 
in annual temperature fit the sunspot 
cycle very nicely. (Climatic change can 
be explained by these varitation in 
temperature. And, as an extention, if 
there are 400 year cycles, why not 4 
million year cycles end tnus the ending 



of whole species?) 

Then if the sunspot activity is 
evidence of the solar energy producing 
mechanism's operation (convection 
currents), the absence of these would be 
evidence of the lack of a production of 
energy (and a lack of nutrinos and a 
general cooling and shrinking and 
speeding up of the rotation of the sun). 

1 work near an office which monitors 
solar activity. I wandered through the 
other day and casually asked "How’s 
business?" The solar forecaster on duty 
stifled a yawn and showed me the 
single, small, high-lattitude spot on the 
sun. Not much for what’s supposed to 
be a period of maximum activity in the 
1 1 year cycle! James Eady remarked 
privately several months ago, “If we 
don’t have any activity by lilac time 
we're in trouble.” When did the lilacs 
bloom? 

With the gravitational collapse of the 
sun, perhaps the increase in internal 
pressure reignites the energy producing 
mechanism. The sun would thus expand 
as the center becomes hotter and more 
energetic. With the primary heat 
producing mechanism operating only 
where the pressure was sufficient, 
convection currents, sunspots, would 

As the sun expands, (he pressure in 
the center could lessen to the extent 
where the mechanism cannot be 
supported. Thermal momentum could 
carry the expansion well beyond this 
point. Then the sun would cool slightly 
and (he cycle would repeat. 

The sun (and thus others like it) 
would be a variable star. An 
explanation for the sun’s variability 
might explain the nuclear mechanism 
for variable stars with a more rapid

Whenever [ get a little self-satisfied 
about our understanding of the universe,- 
something ghastly comes along to 
humble me. But I am in a rather lucky 
field. Meteorologists don't know 
enough about the physics of the Barth's 
atmosphere (or any atmosphere) to have 
many "proven” theories. Even with all 
the geniuses who've graced science, 
understanding comes only after years of 
dog- work.

Does complete and final imdersiandinp 
ever come at .all? I wonder. 

Dear Jim: 

Philip Schreffler's article is the sort 
of thing we've already had loo much of. 
Does the Literary Establishment ignore 
sf <St say that it's all Buck Rogers junk? 
Very well then, we will ignore the 
mainstream & say that it’s all Alexander 
Portnoy junk. That'll fix them! Who 
wants to belong to their silly old 
Establishment anyway? 

As I say, it’s been done before 
(Campbell did it for years), and it 
doesn’t really help. The man who 
accepts everything (he Establishment 
tells him & the man who rejects 
everything the Establishment tells him 
are both slaves. 

And Sehrcfflcr’s argument is 
outdated. As almost everyone else 
seems to have noticed, the academic 
world has stopped ignoring sf. Now we 
have sf courses, and scholarly sf 
journals, and even Cliffs Notes so that 
the people who have to study the books 
don't have to read them. 

Funny thing about that. Has anyone 
pointed out that (he only contemporary 



writers who are noticed by Academe are 
those who have already been recognized 
by the sf world, like Asimov, Clarke, 
Heinlein, Herbert, & Le Guin? Makes 
sense, I suppose. Having to wade 
through all of sf without a guide is a 
fate I would not wish on the most 
pompous pedant. 

I'm glad (hat some good sf writers 
have been recognized, but this situation 
does seem to lead to a paradox. Writers 
like Silvcrbcrg & Malzbcrg, who arc 
perceived by much of the sf world as 
too “literary,” fail to get the attention 
in their own field that would enable 
their supposed natural audience in the 
academic world to notice them. 

Geis & Alter were up to their usual 
high standards, but their call for more 
government (perhaps computer-aided) 
misses one important point. As 
government grows bigger & more 
complex, it does an increasingly worse 
job of giving people what they want. 
Not only does Big Government fail to 
satisfy people's need for an Authority 
that will tell them what to do & what to 
think, but the increase in police- state 
methods has made people less safe from 
violent crime, and the increase in 
welfare-state programs has made people 
less financially secure (via inflation). 
The increase in the size, complexity, & 
apparent power of Big Government has 
been matched by a rise in the popularity 
of small communities like the Moonics 
& the Children of God, which give 
people the mental & material security 
they crave, often by being more 
totalitarian than the government dares to 
be.

Dear Mr. Baen: 

Applause, cheers, and much gratitude 
for Philip A. Schreffler (May 1977, 
“Ray Gun Evaporates Mainstream") 
and his assault on the Mainstream 
Myth. Sf writers (and readers) are often 
arrogant about their field, but few 
would dare to claim that sf is the only 
“true" literature and all else is just the 
"genres" — or worse, trash. 

Having been associated with a 
university, both as a student taking 
futile creative writing courses whose 
teachers wished they were good enough 
to make money at writing and so spent 
half (heir time telling you that writing 
should not be for money and as an 
editor at a university press, where those 
pathetically bad manuscripts kept 
coming in from Ph.D.s whose writing 
talent should have been confined to 
bathroom walls where it could be 
painted over now and then, I have had 
more than ample exposure to the 
pretensions of the literati. And here is 
the truth about the myth; “Mainstream" 
is never written by anybody good. Good 
writers write for the markets — Dickens 
for (he newspapers with his dreadful 
cliff-hanger chapter endings; Shake- 
speare to please the rubbernecking 
groundlings; Milton to get brownie 
points from Cromwell's super- religious 
government; etc. ad infinitum. Then, 
fifty years after a particularly popular 
writer is dead, all the universities are 
studying him. Then, hallowed by the 
sacerdotal rites of English 107 and 
master's theses (rhymes with feces), 
said writers are buried under waste 
matter until, at last, they ripen into 
"great writers" and are thus models for 
the mainstream. 

Sadly, huge numbers of young 
college students, reasonably intelligent. 



arc tricked and brainwashed into 
believing that, in order to be a "good" 
writer, they must write "like” one of 
these baptized-into-the-maitistream dead 
writers. Or like John Updike, one or the 
other. And should they dare to write 
science fiction, besides the Decks of 
vomit on their paper as it is returned, 
they earn the scorn — if not wrath — of 
the professor whose sensibilities have 
thus been assaulted. 

The mainstream is just one genre, 
like any other. I like to call it the 
"literary genre" and I happen not to 
like the pretensions of its practitioners, 
with some few — and delightful — 

exceptions. There are other genres I 
don't like — westerns, for example, and 
big sexy blockbusters (bustblockers?). 
There are genres I love — juveniles, 
science fiction, mysteries, thrillers, 
satire. But my preferences do not label 
me tasteless (within each genre I am 
certainly capable of making reasonable 
judgments about good, bad. and 
indifferent); nor do I consent to being 
drummed out of the intelligentsia (my 
IQ qualifies me for membership in all 
but the most exclusive intellectual 
cliques). I just don't happen to like the 
"mainstream" genre very much, that’s 
all. 

And that's why I'm glad to learn 
through Schreffler’s lovely piece of 
writing that I am not alone! I write 
science fiction (and juveniles, and 
satire) because I love to read those 
things — and because I love to write 
them. And may all the foulest BEMs of 
sf literature defecate on my grave if I 
should ever claim to quit writing sf in 
order to move "up” to the mainstream. 
1 may write mainstream someday — may 
even sell it (we all can dream) — but 
that's a step sideways.

Dear Mr. Baen, 

I do not necessarily try to correct a 
person when I feel he or she is wrong 
about something. But you are a 
magazine editor, and as such you 
influence thousands — perhaps 

millions — of people. And I hate to see 
someone in your position of power 
influencing people wrongly. So I'm 
writing to you. 

In your editorial "Epistle to the 
1 Christians" (Galaxy. Dec. ’76), you 
considered Genesis 1:28, "Be fruitful 
and multiply. ...” to be Cod's 
“Marching Orders” for (he human race. 
And you said that “anyone who both 
believes in the Old Testament and 
accepts the validity of the foregoing 
argument (your interpretation of Genesis 
1:28) must consider himself as divinely- 
instructed to do all in his power to 
further (he progress of humankind into 
Space.” 

But anyone who has read (he Bible 
knows that there are throughout it many 
instructions and orders from God to 
humankind. When your “Commander” 
has been giving you “orders" for 
thousands of years, which “order” do 
you "fully commit” to? Which order 
do you do "all in your power" to obey, 
over and above any other order? 

You pick the order that seems to be 
the "prime directive,” (he order (hat 
our "Commander” feels is the main 
and most important order; the greatest 



A person asked God (Christ), "which 
commandment. .is the greatest?” And 
Christ replied, " ‘You shall love the 
Lord your God with your whole heart, 
with your whole soul and with all your 
mind.' This is the greatest and first 
commandment. The second is like it; 
‘You shall love your neighbor as 
yourself.' On these two commandments 
the whole law is based, and the 
prophets as well." (Matthew 22:36-40) 
"There is no other commandment 
greater than these.” (Mark 12: 31) 

So, for anyone who believes in the 
Bible, if there is any “order” that he or 
she must "do all in his or her power” 
to obey. .any goal that he or she must 
resist and defy any person, process or 
philosophy that acts to the detriment of 
that goal” . any goal (hat he (she) 
must be “fully committed to” . that 
order, that goal must be the one stated 
in Matthew 22:36-40 and Mark 
12:28-31, not Genesis 1:28.
