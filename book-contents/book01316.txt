THE RACE FOR SPACE 



S ince Sputnik, the United States 
has spent some thirty billion 
dollars on the space program; over 
the next few years it has already 
committed thirty billion dollars 
more. Of every ten dollars of Gross 
National Product approximately a 
dime goes into space. 

Question is, is it all worth it? 

That question has been asked 
before, and nobody’s mind seems to 
get changed by any of the answers. 
The people who want to go into 
space still want to; the people who 
think it’s an astronautitical boon- 
doggle still consider it a farce. So 
a better question might be, “Is 
there any way of deciding whether 
it’s all worth it?” 

Let’s start by discounting all of 
the principal arguments that have 
already been advanced on both sides. 
“Why go into space when there’s 
so much to be done right here on 
Earth?” (But it wouldn’t be done 
any faster anyway, you know. 
Things are moving on all fronts.) 
“We must find other livable plan- 
ets to core for Earth’s expanding 
population!” (But colonization has 
never, ever solved a population 
crisis. Europe exported enough 
people, out of its original quarter- 
billion, to supply the Americas with 
a quarter-billion of their own — 



and doubled its own citizenry to 
a half-billion in the same time.) 

Probably the best reason for go- 
ing into space is to learn some- 
thing about our own planet. We 
have a complex atmosphere, which 
makes meteorological theory diffi- 
cult; a simple one like that of Mars 
might give us the Rosetta Stone 
we need to make weather forecast- 
ing — and control — a science. If we 
could only get to it. Our geologists 
are handicapped through — literally 
— having barely scratched the sur- 
face of their subject, namely the 
Earth. A chance to study a few 
other examples would enormously 
simplify our own search for min- 
erals and our knowledge — and per- 
haps prevention — of earthquakes. 

But the question still remains: 
Can we afford it? 

A t the recent Conference <m 
Planetology and Space Mis- 
sion Planning in New York, Dr. 
Ewing of Woods Hole made what 
strikes us a cogent suggestion. 
Let’s turn that problem over the 
economists, he said; let’s find out 
what we can afford, so that we can 
decide how to budget our resources. 

How about it, you graduate stu- 
dents in economics? What a thesis 
waits there for someone!

PRISONERS 
OF THE SKY 

by C. C MacAPP 

Illustrated by MORROW 



Thefr world was six centuries 
lost — now it was threatening 
to destroy itself completely! 



I 

A Item Raab Garan, of the Mesa 
Lowry Fleet, had been pacing 
and sitting and pacing again in the 
Admiral’s anteroom for two hours, 
while the Staff argued behind the 
closed office door. Raised voices 
carried through it. More than once 
he heard his own name. 



For perhaps the twentieth time, 
he walked to the net-covered win- 
dow for a breath of air that didn’t 
reek with the burning animal-fat of 
the lamps. Midnight was long gone. 
The barracks and ground were dark. 
Somewhere, a sentry’s footsteps list- 
lessly plodded their rounds. You 



6 




could hear defeat in those footsteps, 
as you could detect its pervasive, 
dampening effect in so many things 
these days. He resisted the impulse 
to shout angrily at the unseen man. 

There was a scraping of chairs in 
the Admiral’s office. 

Raab turned and stood at atten- 
tion as the door opened and the 
Staff filed out. All of them looked 
furious, and all of them deliberately 
ignored him — which suited him 
fine. He knew his own face was 
flushed and taut, and his hair un- 
doubtedly out of place. When the 
last of them disappeared, he strode 
to the office door — which had been 
slammed — opened it, and stepped 
in. 

Admiral Kline, slumped behind 
the big desk, his white uniform 
rumpled, at least had a smile for 
him. “Sit down, Raab. How’s your 
mother getting along? I’ve been 
meaning to call around ever since 
the funeral, but things have been so 
disorganized . Well, I guess you 
heard the yelling match I just had.” 
Raab nodded. “I’m sorry, sir. But 
— well, hell, excuse me. Admiral, 
but if they just want to sit and do 
nothing while we slowly starve, they 
need stirring up!” 

The Admiral looked at him for a 
moment, then said quietly, “They 
still say that if we hold out, Meder- 
link will eventually get tired of 
blockading.” 

R aab made a disgusted sound. 

“Mesa Orket tried that. They’ve 
got a better mesa than we do in 
Lowry. They didn’t hold out.” 

Kline smiled faintly. “True. 



Nevertheless, we don’t have blimps 
or helium to throw away on ges- 
tures.” 

Raab said impatiently, “Of course 
not, sir. But the blockade can be 
run. We just have to be smarter 
about it!” 

“And you’re smarter?” 

Raab flushed. “I didn’t mean that, 
sir. But I know the country around 
here better than anyone from Med- 
erlink. I know where to get helium 
without being spotted, and I know 
the guano islands. I sailed with my 
father from the time I was six. He 
taught me — ” His throat tightened 
unexpectedly. 

Kline only said, “Yes. Well, you 
haven’t helped yourself by being 
outspoken. They called it insubordi- 
nation. They not only didn’t want to 
approve your request, they wanted 
to court-martial you.” 

Raab said bitterly, “What would 
you want me to do? My dad’s dead. 
He can’t speak for himself.” 

The Admiral said, “I might want 
you to show a little more discretion 
and a little less belligerence. I know 
as well as you do that your father 
was no traitor. I knew him a lot 
longer than you did, remember. But 
we did lose the battle and most of 
the Fleet, and people have to have 
a scapegoat. What we need is time. 
We still couldn’t stand off a landing 
if Mederlink were ready to commit 
herself to one. However I agree with 
you that we can’t just sit, so I’m 
giving you a blimp. It’ll be Gaffer: 
she’s the best I can do. I’ll give you 
two Trimmers and a Half-altern; 
they’ll be men who’ve gotten their 
tails in a crack one way or another. 



PRISONERS OF THE SKY

The rest of the crew will be civilian 
volunteers. I’m afraid they’ll volun- 
teer from hunger, not patriotism, but 
we’ll do the best we can. You’ll be 
short of everything, including he- 
lium.” He added after a moment, 
“Maybe it’ll be a good thing to get 
you away for a while.” 

Raab, trying to control his voice, 
said, “Sir, Gaffer won’t lift a worth- 
while cargo even if I get through.” 
The Admiral sighed. “Nobody 
seems to expect you to get through.” 
He stood up, grunting a little, and 
limped around the desk to put his 
arm around Raab’s shoulders. “I 
don’t have to tell you / hope you 
get through. And any cargo you can 
bring home will be worth while be- 
cause it’ll show it can be done. Lord 
knows we need something to lift 
morale.” He paused. “I’m bumping 
you to Skipper. Maybe you don’t 
think the Staff howled about that.” 
Raab flushed again. “Rank isn’t 
what I’m after.” 

Kline shook his head. “You’ve got 
to have it. You can’t ignore rank 
and regulations and then have disci- 
pline when you need it. You’ll need 
discipline. Good luck, boy.” He 
looked at Raab oddly for a moment. 
“I’U sec that your mother’s looked 
after.” 

II 

A dmiral Kline stood listening ab- 
sently as Raab’s footsteps faded 
down the corridor. After a minute 
Be sighed, went back to his chair, 
and lowered himself stiffly into it. 
His right hand strayed to the pipe- 
stand on his desk, then drew back. 



Tobacco was one of the things Mesa 
Lowry wasn’t growing since the 
blockade. 

He thought, how easy things seem 
to the young! How could you ex- 
plain to a young fire-eater like Raab 
that Authority wasn’t infinitely 
strong nor infinitely elastic? How 
could you get him to stand still and 
listen while you described the des- 
perate persuasions and coercions and 
calling in of old political debts — 
and yes, the bribery — that had 
gone into even the present policy of 
holding out against Mederlink? 

Lord knows, he thought, it was a 
miracle we didn’t surrender two 
years ago, after the Fleet battle. 
Such an impetuous thing as his giv- 
ing a blimp to Roal Garan’s son — 
after the young fool had antagonized 
the whole Staff, too — might upset 
the whole painful balance even now. 

Yet he couldn’t be angry with 
Roal Garan’s son. He grinned, sit- 
ting there, thinking how like his 
father the young Roal Raab was. 
The same lanky frame, the same 
siightly-bent-forward impatient pos- 
ture; the hands and feet so restless 
(when their owner was aground); 
the hatchet-face with its restless blue 
eyes and the skin that needed only 
a token of sun to tan deeply. The 
almost ludicrous pained expression 
when he was forced to stand still. 
The forward-sprouting black hair 
that loathed combs and brushes. 
And, unfortunately, the same head- 
strong impetuousness. Roal had out- 
grown that eventually, of course, or 
he’d never have made Admiral. 

Where had the years gone? It 
seemed no time at all since he and 



8 



IF 




Roal, midshipmen together, ^tebrat- 
ed the victory in the first Mederlink 
war. That had set back the Links* 
plans for a whole generation. But 
somehow, people forgot. And now 
the other free mesas had gone under 
one by one; even Orket 

T he Admiral pondered his mo- 
tives in letting Raab try the 
blockade. It was mostly sentiment, 
he admitted, just as preserving Gaf- 
fer all these years had been, even as 
a training ship. She’d been a proud 
ship once, and it was all right if she 
perished in combat. But it wasn’t all 
right to let Raab and others die if 
the reasons were no more than senti- 
ment — and the clearing of Raab’s 
father’s name. 

It was hard to understand Meder- 
link’s detCTmination to conquer all 
the mesas. Kline knew his ancestors 
on Earth had faced such wars of 
tyranny — he was something of a 
scholar about the home world — but 
he’d always supposed, without think- 
ing much about it, that men on 
Current were different. It was six 
hundred years since the colony ship 
landed, and another century, more 
or less — two or three generations 
— between its departure from Earth 
and arrival to colonize Current. 
Maybe that wasn’t enough time for 
men to change. But Earth had been 
under pressures — crowded billions, 
instead of a few million, as on Cur- 
rent, scattered on isolated mesas. 
And it must have been an uncom- 
fortable world physically, small and 
dense, with its gravity higher than 
Ourrenfs but witb an atmosphere 
so thin that blimps were clumsy and 



impractical. Ther'e was a lot of soul 
therapy m a quiet blimp cruise. But 
then Earth had had petroleum, and 
iron, easily available to support tech- 
nologies vastly beyond Current’s. 
He wondered how ^rth was getting 
along. Current would never know, 
probably, unless a faster-than-ligjit 
drive were invented somewhere. It 
certainly wasn’t likely that any later 
emigrations would happen to come 
to this same planet — this sun wasn’t 
even enough like Sol to attract space- 
farers, though it was abidable, with 
Current’s thick atmosphere. And 
Earth wouldn’t spend generations 
tracing the long gone ships. 

Current was on its own. It would 
have to sink or swim unaided. 

And by all the signs it was sink- 
ing. 

m 

T vo days before the scheduled 
departure, Raab took Gaffer on 
a cross-mesa flight to break in the 
crew. 

Mesa Lowry, at fifty by thirty 
miles, was smaller than Mederlink or 
Orket or most of the other settled 
mesas, and her topsoil was poor. 
But she was six miles high like the 
others, with vertical sides that kept 
dangerous native fauna from reach- 
ing the top, and she was at the edge 
of the sea, handy to the guano is- 
lands for fertilizer. There were no 
other mesas, even unsettled ones, 
and no hills of any height, within a 
hundred miles of Mesa Lowry in 
any direction. 

They were following down the 
mesa’s largest stream, which was low 



10 



IF 




bow; it would be nearly dry later in 
the autumn. It came from the minor 
hills Gaffer had passed an hour ago. 
Raab was sitting on the forward rail 
of the basket, looking back toward 
tiiose hills, where a glider-base had 
recently been built. 

With helium so scarce, hot-air 
balloons were being used to lift 
gliders. One was rising now, a glider 
dangling beneath it like a toy. You 
couldn’t lift a glider very high that 
way. Enemy blimps, aware of that 
fact, sometimes sailed impudently 
over the mesa itself. But at least 
harpoon-carrying gliders could get 
up high enough to keep the enemy 
above effective shooting height. 

The balloon rose higher and was 
hidden by Gaffer’s tail. Raab shifted 
position and idly watched Gaffer^s 
shadow distorting along the bumpy 
ground. It was a clear warm day; 
there were no clouds in sight except 
the low line of them, dark at the 
base but dazzling white where the 
sun hit them, along the mesa’s sea- 
ward edge where the moisture-laden 
sea breeze humped itself up. Even 
Gaffer’s shadow looked trivial, com- 
pared to that of a modern fighting 
blimp. 

They’d certainly given him the 
next thing to nothing. Her bag was 
only a hundred eighty feet long, 
barely forty-five in diameter. The 
vanes at the rear were fixed, so 
horizontal steering was by the pad- 
dles only. The basket, rigidly sus- 
pended, was fifty-five feet long, eight 
feet wide and four feet high at the 
rail. The middle thirty-five feet had 
places for ten paddlers on a side, 
but because she was undergassed 



and weight was critical, Raab had 
only eighteen paddlers, plus himself 
and the three other Fleetmen. The 
paddles, at least, were new, with 
flaps that opened themselves on the 
backsweep so the paddles didn’t have 
to be wrist-feathered. 

In each end of the basket, besides 
other paraphernalia, was a large 
handwheel which turned a shaft pro- 
jecting out forward or aft of the 
basket. These shafts wound up or re- 
leased a series of lines running 
around the gasbag. As they squeezed 
or loosened they could vary the dia- 
meter of sections fore and aft, thus 
trimming or tilting ship or varying 
lift without one’s having to valve 
gas or drop ballast. 

The Fleetman at each wheel had 
the rank of Trimmer. The forward 
Trimmer, standing near Raab, was 
Ammet Oleeny, whom Raab knew 
well. He was uncolorful and quiet, 
seeming to blend into the back- 
ground, but Raab knew there was 
wit behind the plain face, and that 
the man was reliable and very con- 
scientious about his job. The Aft 
Trimmer, Sols Vannyer, tended to 
be sullen. 

A glider, evidently finishing its 
tour of duty since it was this low, 
came toward them, tilting a wing as 
it made a turn around them. The 
pilot eyed the nondescript crew, then 
the single rubber-powered harpoon 
launched on the forward rail, and 
finally the bag itself. Even here, 
where outside air pressure was only 
eighteen pounds per square inch, the 
softness was noticeable. Finally he 
looked at Raab, recognized him, 
showed surprise — th«t hostility. 



MIISONERS OF THE SKY 



II 




He arrested the hand-wave he*d 
begun, and banked away abruptly. 
Raab felt his own face grow hot. 
He hoped no one would see. 

r iey passed over a farm where a 
group of men pulled a plow — 
most draft animals had been killed 
and eaten by now. The men’s faces 
when they looked up were gaunt, 
tired, dull. 

Anger stirred in Raab. He turned 
his head and stared at the bank of 
clouds, ten miles away, until he 
made out a group of black dots in 
the sky above it: Link ships, making 
sure no one tried to sneak off the 
mesa under cover of the clouds. 

That wasn’t die way Raab would 
go. He’d drop off the northern edge, 
at night, and head inland first for 
more helium. 

He faced aft and called to his 
Second-in-Command, “Ben, make 
1^ and half -speed toward tibe Cap- 
itol.’’ He watdied as Half-altem Ben 
Sprake, Jr., avoiding Raab’s eyes 
and not admowledging the order, 
directed die paddlers. The blimp’s 
nose slowly poked about. He’d 
known Ben since ddldhood, both of 
them bdng sons oi Fleet officers. 
Ben, a short, sli^dy plump young 
man, affected a blond moustache 
that belonged on a fiercer face. Raab 
wasn’t sinri»ised at his sullenness. 
Ben had never gotten above Half- 
altem because he’d been caught 
cheating on a test; and now Raab, 
two years younger, had made fuD 
Skipper. 

But Boi ^dnt h<tid grudges (or 
any othe* mood) very long. Rsab 
thought heM be all rig^ He’d have 



preferred a tougher man — but there 
didn’t seem to be much toughness 
left in Mesa Lowry. 

They were cutting across a bend 
of the stream now, toward the 
mesa’s only lake — a one-by-seven- 
mile body of water beside wWch the 
Capitol lay. He could see a few 
blimps above the Capitol; most of 
them fighting ships on guard. There 
were only two or three cargo ships. 
Government House, the only four- 
story building on Lowry, loomed 
above the lake. 

He caught Ben’s eye. “Give us 
about five degrees more left, will 
you?’’ 

Ben muttered to the paddlers, 
“Ease off portside, two strokes. Now 
all paddles, half-speed.” Oaffer 
steadied on the new course. 

They were nearly over the hdce 
now, on the side opposite the Capi- 
tol. Raab stared ahead at the farm 
where he’d been born. Trirnm^ 
Oleeny startled him by asking, “Your 
farm. Skipper?” 

“Uh — yes.” Even after two 
years, it was hard to remember that 
he was legally the owner now, wdtii 
his father lost in the battle that had 
destroyed his reimtation. It was de- 
serted; his motho* was staying m 
town, and both sisters were married. 
An uncle was supposed to be lock- 
ing after the place. There was a very 
sparse volunteer grain crop, and die 
fruit orchard looked fair, but the 
vegetable patches were notUng but 
straggly weeds. 

They sailed past the house, and 
Raab suddenly stiffened. Sc»neoiw 
had put on the front door, in 
red letters, “M.M.” 



12 



ir 




That, of course, meant “Mesa 
Mederlink.” Fury rose in him. He 
strode aft, where the paddlers would 
be facing him. “Excuse me, Ben. 
Stop paddles.” 

Gaffer drifted. When he had con- 
trol of his voice, he asked, “Do all 
you men have your affairs wound 
up?” 

They sat looking at him silently 
for a minute, then Jon Cudebek, 
whom they’d elected as spokesman 
— a burly, black-eyed man whose 
scalp hair seemed to have abdicated 
completely in favor of bushy black 
eyebrows — said, “We don’t have 
much in the way of affairs lately, 
Skipper.” 

“All right,” Raab said, “We’re 
leaving tonight.” 

Ben Sprake muttered, “We’re sup- 
posed to . .” 

“To hell with that!” Raab said. 
Then, regretting his rudeness, 
“There’s no reason to wait. We’ll 
load supplies this afternoon and 
leave as soon as it’s dark.” 

IV 

G affer drifted furtively toward the 
northern edge of Lowry. Nei- 
ther of the two large moons would 
be up before midnight, and the stars 
gave barely enough light to see the 
ground. Raab, at the forward rail, 
hands cupped behind his ears for 
any sounds ahead, was nervously 
conscious of the blimp’s own un- 
avoidable sounds — Ben vSprake mut- 
tering cadence aft for the paddlers, 
the rubbing noises of the oarlocks, 
the whisper of paddle-vanes, the 
creak of rigging. There’d been a pair 



of Mederlink Hens operating off this 
inland edge lately — huge bulging 
blimps, with grappling-lines for the 
gliders they carried. Gliders wouldn’t 
be flying at night, of course. But 
there’d be fighting blimps backing 
up the Hens, and they’d be on lis- 
tening-patrol. 

If spies had gotten out word of 
this sortie, it was probably a good 
thing he was leaving ahead of sche- 
dule. 

The dimly seen ground ended, and 
the black abyss waited. Turning his 
head so they could hear him aft too, 
he quietly told Ammet Oleeny, 
“Give her two turns forward,” then 
reached for a spoke of the hand- 
wheel to help the Trimmer haul it 
around. The rigging creaked and the 
cinch-lines made rubbing sounds on 
the bag; the nose dipped. They be- 
gan to slide down, a little more 
steeply than he liked. “Ease off hall 
a turn forward.” 

Now the mesa blotted out the 
stars aft, and the bag hid them for- 
ward; only to the sides was there 
anything but blackness. Some small 
flying creature screetched and fled. 
Gaffer picked up speed and began 
to roll. Ben Sprake tried to cancel 
the roll with the paddles, but the 
crew hadn’t had enough practice to- 
gether. “Let it go, Ben,” Raab told 
him softly. 

It was good to have a roll. As 
the basket swung up he could see 
higher to each side — and possibly 
spot the bulk of an enemy blimp 
against the stars. 

He was relaxing a little now, 
though he kept one hand cupped to 
an ear. He always felt better in the

air. Some people called him sky- 
happy. Maybe he was. He never got 
bored, on the longest trip, but could 
sit during the day watching what- 
ever the sky offered, and at night 
simply doze briefly or listen to the 
ship’s sounds or the wingbeats of 
nocturnal flyers circling curiously, or 
smell whatever faint smells the 
breeze carried. Right now, those still 
were mesa smells. They were miles 
too high for the lustier scents of the 
jungle. 

They had about a two-knot tail- 
wind, if it hadn’t changed. With 
their downward slide through Dur- 
rent’s thick atmosphere plus what 
the paddles contributed, they must 
have close to ten knots ground-speed. 
By now, he guessed, they were elev- 
en or twelve miles from the mesa 
and had dropped about a mile of 
altitude. 

At this rate they’d soon be past 
any likely patrol from Mederlink. 

Then, fifteen minutes later, he 
heard the high-pitched ring of a 
ship’s echo-sounder — a disk of 
quartz struck with a small mallet. It 
was ahead and to port, and not 
close enough to get an echo from 
Gaffer’s bag. But one ship wouldn’t 
be operating alone. “Stop paddles,” 
he murmured, just loud enough to 
be heard, then listened hard. 

There was a very faint ping from 
dead ahead. 

I t was too risky simply to try to 
slip by; he’d have to dive. He 
ordered softly, “One more turn, 
fore and aft.” 

The sound of the rigging made 
him hold his breath, but then there 



was silence except for the growing 
whisper of air along the bag. The 
nose dipped farther. They were 
really going down, now, and he fret- 
ted about the softness of the bag. 
It was anybody’s guess exactly how 
far down he could go before the 
thickening air squeezed the under- 
gassed bag beyond recovery. Buoy- 
ancy versus squeeze; that was the 
old bugaboo of diving. 

The pinging sounds were definite- 
ly above them now, but he daren’t 
level out yet. He listened for the 
sound of signal-flutes, which would 
mean one of the ships had heard 
him. They were rolling more than 
thirty degrees now. Abruptly, some- 
one retched aft. “Damn it!” he mut- 
tered savagely, “Clamp your hand 
over your mouth!” 

They must have lost another mile 
and a half, now. He opened his 
mouth to order constriction off; he- 
sitated. Foolish to panic and pull 
out too soon. He bent over the for- 
ward rail, felt for the ropes that held 
the ballast-sacks, made ready to 
slash them. He’d never been in a 
dive this steep. His ears popped, and 
he swallowed hard to clear them. 

Suddenly he felt they’d reached 
the limit. “Off all constriction! 
Drop ballast fore and aft!” He jerk- 
ed out his knife and hacked at the 
ropes, felt Ihe jar as the weight 
dropped away. There was no similar 
jar from aft. “Drop ballast aft!” he 
called sharply. No need for silence 
now; they were miles below the 
search. Finally he felt the aft ballast 
go. They still had the sharp tilt, and 
weren’t slowing perceptibly. He 
grabbed Oleeny’s arm. “Pick up 



14 



IF 




what you can and take it aft!” He 
himself groped for a pair of food 
bags, lurched up the slanting deck, 
heard Oleeny slip and curse behind 
him. He groped his way forward 
again, bumping into the Trimmer 
halfway, and got another load. 

That was all they could move 
quickly. He and Oleeny stayed in 
the stern. He fumbled for a lantern, 
thumbed its striker until it lit. Now 
all they could do was wait. He heard 
a sound he’d never heard before, 
but which he could recognize — the 
nose of the bag flapping in the 
pressure. God, they were far down! 
The air was soupy, making the 
lungs labor. Ben Sprake leaned over 
the rail and was sick again. The 
paddlers’ faces were frightened in 
the harsh light. 

But the nose was lifting, and at 
last they were level. 

But they hadn’t enough buoyancy, 
even in this heavy air, squeezed as 
they were. He tried not to cringe. A 
crash in the jungle would be mild 
— but the jungle wouldn’t. 

He could hear the huge wings 
now, still below them but not far, 
of the predators that could pluck 
men out of a basket like fruit, or 
tear a bag to shreds if they took the 
notion. How much altitude now? A 
quarter-mile? The jungle reek was 
strong in his nostrils. 

The nose was tilted up slightly 
now, and he told the paddlers, 
“Now. Give it everything you’ve 
got. Pull! Back, rest, pull!” He gave 
Oleeny a nod, and led the way to 
the two empty seats; unlashed the 
paddle and picked up the stroke. 
“Pull! Back, rest — ” 



T heir slow descent hadn’t check- 
ed any; the tighter squeeze on 
the bag offset the increasing buoy- 
ancy of the air. But, with the uptilt, 
the paddles fought the negative lift. 
The men grunted with effort, mak- 
ing the paddles creak as if they’d 
break. Something huge flapped by 
with a harsh croak, and Raab held 
his breath until it was gone. 

Gradually the descent slowed. 
Now they were holding even, but 
the men — and Raab — were gasp- 
ing. 

Between strokes, he got out, “A 
— little — longer.” He forced his 
own shoulders to go on, though 
every stroke was agony. 

Were they rising a little now? If 
they weren’t, they were beaten. He 
might as well find out; if they bump- 
ed into a tall tree, or some hill . 
“Ease paddles. Half speed.” The 
temptation was awful to quit alto- 
gether. 

They certainly weren’t falling any- 
more. There was time, now, to 
unlash supplies and jettison them, if 
need be, but he thought he’d wah 
until he was sure he had to. “St<^ 
paddles.” 

They all slumped there, except tbt 
Aft Trimmer, who hadn’t offered to 
spell anybody, and Sprake, who was 
too sick. They waited. Gaffer lost 
all headway and began to swing, 
very slowly, in a breeze that couldn’t 
amount to more than a fraction of 
a knot. 

After a while one of the paddlers, 
a wizened little man called Pokey 
Reger, whom Raab had accepted 
only because he wouldn’t weight 
much — but who apparently coidd

IS 




pull a fair paddle — said, “Be it 
likely them ship’ll see this lantern, 
Skipper?” 

“No,” Raab told him. “We’re 
miles away now, and the bag hides 
it. I’m more concerned about — ” 
He didn’t fimish. If they didn’t lift, it 
would be time enough to dump 
scarce supplies. 

But, very gradually, he began to 
feel that the air was moving down 
along the bag. “We’re lifting,” he 
said. 

Some of the men began to grin. 
This dive was something they could 
talk about die rest of their lives. 
“By damn,” someone said, “I sure 
thought — ” Raab wondered how 
many of them knew how close it 
had been. A Httle less gas, or a 
minute longer in the dive . 
“Paddles, hatf speed,” he said, and 
got up to take the lantern forward, 
so he could b^er see anything that 
loomed ahead of them. But they 
must have gained a thousand fe^ 
by now; the jungle sounds were 
faint. 

T he first of the big moons came 
up. He could see the wild tan- 
gle below them, the great ponderous 
flappings. 

Wearily he made his way aft. 
“We may as well shift this stuff for- 
ward and get leveled.” When that 
was done, he wdered, “Stop paddles. 
Ammet, get out some sandwiches 
and a skin oi wine. After we eat, 
anyone who feels like napping can 
go ahead.” 

He sat on the forward rail widi 
a sandwich. Gaffer could lift on her 
own for an hour or two. 



He watched the second moon's 
big half-disc grow slo^y up frdflil 
the horizon. He remembered seeing, 
as a boy, a distant blimp drifting in 
silhouette against just such a moon. 
That way — east — lay conquered 
Orket, and beyond that, Mederlink. 
The Links were probably operating 
their blockade out of Mesa Orkrt 
now. 

What he needed first of all was 
helium. He’d have to get it slowly, 
a few Floaters at a time, avoiding 
the rich Floater lakes that were 
likely to be watched. He’d also have 
to shoot some game with the two 
hand-bows aboard, and cook up a 
supply of meat, and stock some fruit 
and greens. Then he’d head west and 
try to get around the blockade to 
the sea and the guano islands. 

But of course he couldn’t begin 
to fed optimistic until he was in- 
land, (Hit of sight. 

He looked aft. Lowry, plainly vis- 
Halc in the moonlight, still occupied 
durty degrees of the horizon, rising 
to twke his present altitude. He 
decided he’d better put out the 
lantern and gain another couple of 
mfles, for insurance. But he’d better 
slow their lift; they had buoyancy 
to spare now. “One-half turn, fore 
and aft.” When he got her up there 
and balanced, he’d have a nap. 

T he seventeen-hour night came to 
an end, and Durrent’s sun pour- 
ed gcrfd upon the pland. Lowry was 
a little fi^er away now; but not 
reassuringly so. The sea was visible 
as a blue strip on the horizon, only 
a little dirtied by haze. The paddlers, 
refreshed, wwe pulling deadily.

By noon they were over grass 
country, where the jungle invaded 
as slim fingers along the river val- 
leys. 

They passed over an immense 
herd of grazing animals, looking in- 
dividually tiny from this height, 
though Raab knew a big male could 
weigh twenty tons. The air was full 
of flying creatures, though the big 
ones, of course, were confined to 
lower levels. Gaffer had an escort 
— mostly triphibs under five feet 
long; of various species but all basi- 
cally like snakes with two pairs of 
stubby wings in tandem and with 
eight thin legs, folded in flight — 
but including also Terran-descended 
gulls, which had been brought for 
some reason in the old colonization 
ships from Earth. They adapted to 
the medium-altitude lakes rather 
than to the thick-aired sea level. It 
was good to have the escort, for the 
creatures would warn by their be- 
havior if an enemy blimp came 
down from above. 

The gorge country loomed higher 
by the hour. He worked the paddlers 
in shifts, that day and the next 
night. By the following morning he 
was within a few miles of sanc- 
tuary. 

V 

A t some time in the geological 
past, a layer of molten rock 
several miles deep had occupied this 
edge of the continent, overlaying 
solid rock of higher melting point. 

As the upper layer cooled it 
cracked in a mosaic pattern, leav- 
ing, between masses of hardened 



rock, a labyrinth of miles-deep fis- 
sures; some only a few yards wide, 
some as wide as a quarter of a 
mile. Erosion, quakes and volcanos 
had complicated the (Miginal jumble. 
There remained an unpredictable 
maze of twisting gorges, tunnels, 
caves, lakes, dead-end fissures, sud- 
den open pockets and partly filled 
valleys. Rivers, from the still higher 
snow-country farther inland, found 
torturous ways through the jumble, 
carving away rock, bringing in soU 
or washing it away. In general, there 
was considerable water, fewer sunny 
hollows than shaded ones, more 
rock than soil and many isolated 
anomalies. Inland, the chasms were 
more filled up; farther seaward, 
they were mostly washed empty. A 
spectrum of ecologies had formed, 
often badly intertangled. 

Floaters, the source of helium, 
grew on shady lakes at medium alti- 
tudes. 

From Gaffer's present position, 
one saw abrupt cliffs in one long 
wall, with gaps here and there like 
missing teeth, the gray rock lined 
vertically as if hundreds of black 
threads hung down it. Each of those 
threads was a vertical chasm. Most 
of them were wide enough for a 
blimp to enter. 

Raab was following up a river 
that was placid at this season. Pres- 
ently it could be seen that the river 
emerged from a narrow chasm, the 
bottom of which it had undercut 
into a virtual tunnel fifty yards wide 
and twice that high. He took Gaffer 
down slowly toward the opening. 
Finally, little Pokey Reger said, "Be 
we going in there. Skipper?** 



PRISONERS OF THE SKY

Raab grinned at the wizened awk- 
ward little man. “It’s safe. I’ve been 
through it more than once.” 

The crew eyed the hole, uncon- 
vinced. Finally Jon Cudebek said, 
“Why this way?” 

Raab said, a little impatiently, 
“This is the most direct, and easiest, 
way to a place I have in mind. Also 
the safest, because the Links won’t 
know about it. Ben, will you take us 
inr’ 

T hey pulled in slowly, giving their 
eyes time to adjust. By the 
time they were a quarter-mile in, 
the bright opening was lost behind 
a turn. A soimd of rapids came 
from ahead, but here the river flow- 
ed smoothly, perfectly clear, border- 
ed by clean sand on either side. The 
walls and the overhang were covered 
with pale-green moss, giving the dim 
light a greenish tinge. In places, the 
six-mile deep crack above them was 
straight enough to let in a streak of 
brighter light, blue by contrast, along 
the middle of the river. Fish and 
small triphibs darted away from 
Gaffer’s shadow. The place had a 
dank smell, made more unpleasant 
by the density of the air. What 
breeze there was came downstream: 
cold air dumping itself through the 
tunnel. 

They passed the rapids, a place 
where rock had fallen and not yet 
been worn away, then moved along 
another smooth stretch. That ended 
at a sharp turn, where the water 
had deeply undercut one side, leav- 
ing much fallen rock and a cave. 
Raab, busy with the turn, had only 
glanced into the dark cave, and it 



was Ammet Oleeny who said sud- 
deidy, “Skipper, I think I saw some- 
thing in there!” 

“Oh? What?” 

“A wreck, I thought!” 

Raab faced aft. “Stop paddles!” 
He struck the biggest lantern, which 
had a white-painted board behind 
it for a reflector. “Ben, take her 
back a few yards.” 

He aimed the light into the cave. 
Someone grunted in surprise. A limp 
gasbag lay upon the rocks, the con- 
tour of a basket showing through 
ii. “Ben, land us between those two 
big rocks.” While they maneuvered 
in, Raab broke out mooring stakes. 
“Ammet, take one of the hand- 
bows.” He looked from one to an- 
other of the paddlers. “Cudebek, 
how are you with a bow?” 

“Fair, Skipper.” 

‘Take the other one, then. There 
might be triphibs here.” 

He lit a smaller lantern and took 
it with them. He, Oleeny, and Gude- 
bek clambered over the rocks to the 
wreck. A six-foot triphib launched 
itself away from them, its bulging 
eyes reflecting the light, and slid 
smoothly into the river. Raab held 
up his lantern near the vanes of the 
wrecked bag. 

The name Goshawk stared back 
at him. 

He stood frowning at it, bewild- 
ered. “Goshawk? Why, she was one 
of the squadron escorting our Hens, 
and she was shot down a hundred 
miles at sea!” His heart was sudden- 
ly pounding. “Or — so the report 
said!” He called back to Gaffer, 
“Make camp! We’re going to be 
here for a while!”

IF 




F ive hours later, they sat for their 
second meal in the cave. Raab, 
his mind awhirl, realized suddenly 
that little Pokey Reger had spoken 
to him. “I beg your pardon, Reger?” 
“I said, be she got away, why 
didn’t she come home to Lowry, 
Skipper?” 

The others waited on the an- 
swer. Raab, curbing his impatience, 
said, “Obviously, because she’d been 
hit and lost too much gas to lift 
that high. She was probably coming 
after gas when they ambushed her.” 
Reger seemed to puzzle over that. 
Cudebek, his heavy brows pulled 
down, said, “The fact that they were 
killed with Lowry harpoons and ar- 
rows isn’t necessarily proof of trea- 
son, is it? Couldn’t they have been 
captured weapons? Couldn’t a whole 
ship have been captured?” 

Raab looked at him, scowling. 
“The report’s definite, whether it’s 
false or not. It says they went down 
in the first surprise attack on our 
Hens. There couldn't have been any 
ships captured before then. And 
those men were killed here, not at 
sea. They were sitting at the paddles 
when the arrows hit them. So they 
were ambushed. By whom? This pas- 
sage was a Fleet secret. Did any of 
you ever hear of it?” 

They admitted they hadn’t. 

“All right, then,” Raab demanded, 
“what do you make of it?” 

Ben Sprake said, in a subdued but 
belligerent voice, “It seems funny 
that you brought us right to it.” 
Raab spun and walked over to 
him. “That’s a pretty stupid remark. 
Your father as well as mine was 
killed in the battle.” 



Sprake’s blond mustache bristled. 
“At least, I’m sure mine was loyal!” 
Raab hit him and he went over 
backwards, gasping with pain as his 
elbows hit gravel. He lay glaring 
up, a small trickle of blood coming 
from one corner of his mouth. Raab 
took two steps and stood over him, 
shaking, slowly opening and closing 
his right hand. He’d never felt so 
hot and tense in his life. An aston- 
ished part of his mind realized he 
was ready to kill Sprake if he got 
up. But Sprake, as much surprised 
as hurt, stayed down, and Raab’s 
fury slowly drained away. 

He turned his back on the Half- 
altern. He was sorry now he’d hit 
him, or half sorry. He knew Ben 
hadn’t really meant what he’d said. 
It was just frustration and envy spill- 
ing over. Well, it was too late now. 
He faced the silent crew. 

“We’d better get out of here. I’m 
not sure now what the Links do 
know. There’s a place I want to get 
to before sunup.” 

VI 

C ollapse, at an intersection of 
chasms, had left a roughly cir- 
cular pit about a mile in diameter 
and a mile and a half deep. A river 
had made it into a lake and depos- 
ited sediment over the rubble before 
finding itself a new course elsewhere, 
leaving the lake fed only by small 
local streams. The lake had shrunk 
to a few hundred yards* diameter, 
exposing good soil which got a cer- 
tain amount of sun. Suitable grasses 
and trees had found the spot, then 
animals had moved in. Some triphib.

probably, had unwittingly carried in 
Kve fish eggs. Galls added the for- 
eign phenomenon of feathers and 
hard-shelled eggs. 

What brought Raab to this parti- 
cular valley was a large rock-fall on 
the northern side. With the help of 
trees it camouflaged a cave where 
Gaffer could be hidden, and where 
a fire could safely be built. 

He got the blimp maneuvered in 
and tied down, and sent out men 
with signal-flutes to watch the var- 
ious approaches, then gave the rest 
of the crew their leisure. "You can 
bathe or wash clothes in the creek, 
but stay out of the lake itself. There 
are some real teeth in it. The best 
way to fish the lake is with a throw- 
line. Have clubs handy in case you 
hook anything big. Stay near cover 
and don’t leave tracks or stray gear, 
and listen for the flutes. We’ll or- 
ganize a hunting-party this after- 
noon.” With a little embarrassment, 
he told Ben Sprake, “You can have 
the first watch off if you like.” 

Sprake mumbled something, got a 
bar of soap and his dirty clothes, 
and went with the others. Before 
long Raab heard them whooping and 
swearing at the coldness of the 
stream. He grinned. He hadn’t plan- 
ned it that way, but later, when he 
took his own bath, the sun would 
have warmed the creek. 

He stuck a signal flute in his 
pocket, then walked over to Oleeny, 
who, typically, was checking over 
the forward rigging before thinking 
of leisure. “You’ll spend the first 
watch here, Ammet?” 

“Sure, Skipper. I’ll get a fire go- 
ing, in case we catch anything.” 



“Thanks,” Raab said, and started 
out to cheek on his sentries. 

By the time he got back, most of 
the men had their clothes washed 
and spread out under trees to dry. 
He made sure they were well hidden 
from the sky, then walked to the 
lake where some of the men were 
fishing. Jon Cudebek had already 
caught something and was cleaning 
it. Raab walked over for a look, 
and grunted with surprise. “Is that 
a metal knife?” 

C udebek, squatted beside his catch, 
looked up at Raab for a mo- 
ment, then wiped the knife on the 
ground and held it out, handle first. 
Raab took it and examined it. 

The handle was bone, and fairly 
ordinary. Blade and hilt were one 
piece of dark bronze. He ran his 
finger along the ten-inch cutting 
edge. It was a fine piece of metal; 
over an inch wide and more than 
an eighth inch thick. The hilt itself 
would have made a passable knife, 
beaten into shape. Such a knife must 
have cost years of a paddler’s earn- 
ings. He handed it back. “Thanks. 
I’ve heard a lot of pro and con 
about metal blades. What’s your 
experience?” 

Cudebek pursed his lips to show 
he was considering his reply, and 
deftly hacked a wing off his catch. 
It was one of the common triphib 
species, like a fat eel, five feet long 
and ten inches at the middle, with 
two pairs of rather small legs. Cu- 
debek sliced off the last wing, turn- 
ed the belly up and paused before 
slitting it open. “There are good and 
bad features. That thing of yours

IF 




— ” nodding toward Raab’s Fleet 
Issue knife of polished flint, with 
bone handle — “will saw a lot more 
rope and hold its edge. But bronze 
won’t break or chip as easily, aiwl 
it can be honed sharp in a few 
minutes. The main trouble is, you 
have to keep it cleaned and greased 
so it won’t corrode, and you have 
to be careful what you grease it 
with.” He sliced .open the triphib, 
exposing red blood and pinkish meat 
f which, grilled, would be delicious). 
“Of course, a metal knife’s compact 
and easy to carry.” 

“That’s true,” Raab said. “Is that 
Terran metal, or native?” 

Cudebek grinned. “Native. You’d 
have to burglarize the Orket Mu- 
seum to get a piece of Old Terran 
metal this big, any more. It’s a na- 
tive bronze, hammered and burnt re- 
peatedly to get rid of impurities, or 
something.” He deftly sliced out the 
triphib’s viscw’a, and answered the 
question Raab would have asked. “I 
spent all my savings on it, four or 
five years ago when I was younger 
and foolisher. Fve been tempted to 
sell it more than once, since things 
have been bad, but I’ve always got- 
ten by somehow and hung onto it. 
Maybe I’m still pretty foolislf.” 
“No,” Raab said, “I wouldn’t say 
that. It’s a beautiful thing.” He half 
turned to leave, then paused. “Olee- 
ny’s got a fire ^^g, when you want 
to cook that** 

T he watch ended. He took his 
own laundry to ^e creek. 

The water was stffl chilly, but 
bearable, and fte sun was almost too 
warm. He remembered a happier 



time when he was about four tees, 
and his father brought haa henk. 
There’d been talk of estal^shing a 
Fleet base, to guard the Floator 
lakes hereabouts, but it had never 
been done. 

After bathing and doing his lam- 
dry, he went back to the ship, whore 
there was hot water, to hack off his 
beard. When that chore was done, 
it was time for lunch. Then in the 
afternoon he took a hunting-party 
out with the two bows and got 
some tree-phibs, which had a little 
different flavor from those that stay- 
ed mostly in the water. And while 
they were hunting they gathered 
some fruit and some greens and dug 
a few roots that weren’t much for 
taste but were very effective in 
warding off scurvy. 

At sundown, everyone except a 
few lookouts gathered in the cave, 
where there were now four smafi 
fires. Cudebek, helped by the will- 
ing but bumble-handed little Pokey 
Reger, was cooking and salting-down 
extra meat. The Aft Trimmer, Sols 
Vannyer, had checked over the aft 
rigging by now and was showing his 
first signs of geniality, in a gambling 
session with about half the paddlers. 
Ben Sprake sat near them, watching, 
silent but not sulking. A paddler 
named Willie Wainer, a tall young 
man with straight black hair who 
wasn’t too bright but had a good 
pair of wrists and hands for the 
paddles, was, surprisingly, coaxing 
something like music out of a signal 
flute. Later, when the wine began to 
take effect (Raab had rationed out 
enough for euphoria but not drunk- 
enness), somebody got a food-tub to

IF 




thump on, and there was a sort of 
hornpipe dance. One of the men 
began bellowing an ancient chant, 
senseless and nearly tuneless, “John- 
ny, does your dog bite, dog bite, 
dog bite — ?” 

Raab knew what a dog was; had 
seen pictures of them; but if any 
survived on Durrent, it wasn’t on 
any of the settled mesas. He sup- 
posed the song went back as far as 
Earth itself. 

That made him a little moody; for 
the idea of Earth carried with it 
connotations of mighty lost glories. 

Anyway, the men were having a 
good time; and since they were re- 
habilitating so fast, he wouldn’t have 
to spend a second day here. He’d 
chase them to bed at midnight, and 
lift early in the morning for a Float- 
er Lake. 

VII 

T he surface of the Floater lake 
was about three miles above 
sea level, which left it an equal dis- 
tance below the top of the gorge it 
was in. The gorge itself ran roughly 
north and south, and enjoyed a few 
minutes of sun a day even though 
it was less than two hundred yards 
wide. Except when the sun shone 
directly in at midday, it was very 
gloomy at lake level. Looking down 
into it from above, a searcher would 
see only blackness below the upper 
mile or so. The lake itself was only 
four or five miles long, and not rich 
in Floater plants, so Raab didn’t ex- 
pect to find more than six or seven 
mature Floaters. To put Gaffer in 
really luxurious shape, gas-wise, he’d 



have to harvest ten or twelve such 
lakes. Half as many would put her 
in fair condition. 

Winding along the gorge toward 
the lake. Gaffer’s bag hid the thin 
bright blue ribbon which was the 
morning sky overhead. The river 
deep in the the gorge was lost in 
gloom. Ahead, the falls that emptied 
the lake were a growing mutter. 

He decided it was time to get 
some altitude. “Off one turn, for- 
ward.” The nose lifted slowly. The 
paddlers shifted their feet, bracing 
against the mild tilt. The mutter 
ahead became a rumble, then a roar. 
Two more bends of the gorge, and 
the falls came into sight — not a 
single cascade, but a series, spilling 
white and foamy over the stairway 
of fallen rock that dammed the 
gorge. It was remarkable how much 
that white water, reflecting sky-light, 
brightened the gorge. Now he could 
feel the spray on his face. A flight 
of small triphibs, disturbed by Gaf- 
fer, leaped from some rocky ledge 
and took undulating flight to sanc- 
tuary in the lake. 

The ship lifted and passed over 
the brink of the falls, and the roar 
faded behind her. The lake was a 
dark placid ribbon dotted here and 
there with the dark-green, sixty-foot- 
wide Floater pads, each with its for- 
est of man-tall vertical shoots that 
gathered light and air. He peered 
up the lake, looking for the pale 
straw-colored mature spheres. “Half- 
altern, ahead and to the left. See it? 
Take us down there, please.” 

Gaffer settled until the basket 
hung above a pad. Raab dropped a 
rope ladder over the rail, paid out a

hose, then turned and beckoned to 
Pokey Reger, whom he’d chosen to 
help him because the man didn’t 
weigh much. He descended, turned 
and watched Reger’s awkward ef- 
forts as the men leaned over the 
rail, grinning at the same thing. Re- 
ger’s job wouldn’t be complicated. 
Raab reached up a hand to help 
him, then turned and pushed a way 
through the shoots. 

The mature sphere, close to the 
center of the pad, was eight feet 
tali and a little less in diameter, 
translucent, ribbed vertically and — 
now — bulging with helium. Theory 
was that the planet extracted hydro- 
gen from water and somehow turned 
it into helium. There was contro- 
versy as to whether that was possi- 
ble, but Raab was willing to take the 
gas and let the theory go. He said 
to Reger, “Ever do tWs before?” 
“Can’t say so. Skipper. I only 
been off the mesa a few times.” 
“Well, stand on the other side of 
it and hold two corners of this 
square of cloth, in case it breaks 
free. I’ll be ready to grab the other 
two.” 

He waited until Pokey was on the 
other side, then tossed the cloth so 
it spread over the top of the sphere. 
Then he poked the nozzle of the 
hose into the thin-walled sphere, 
pushing it in until a soft rubber 
gasket made contact. The hose stif- 
fened with pressure. Later, when the 
sphere grew limp, someone in the 
basket would work the hand-bellows. 

I t was only a few moments later 
that Reger said in a quiet voice, 
“Don’t move a eyelash. Skipper.” 



Simultaneously Raab heard a ripple 
of water somewhere behind him. 

Not daring to turn his head, he 
turned his eyes up toward Oleeny 
and asked quietly, “What is it?” 

“Quadrala, Skipper. Big one.” 

Raab kept his voice down. 
’’Sprake, lift and draw it away. 
You’ll have to kill it or it’ll attack 
you, eventually.” 

The creature, circling Gaffer, 
came into view. It was a quadrala, 
all right — close to sixty feet long, 
its snake-like head nearly as big as 
a man. Its two pairs of wings — one 
about a third of the way back along 
its body, the other, two-thirds back 
— flapped alternately, so that its 
long body undulated. The skin was 
a crazy-quilt pattern of light and 
dark green — out of place here; but 
a common jungle pattern. The eight 
legs looked insignificant. But any 
pair of them could jerk a man into 
the air. It followed Gaffer up, utter- 
ing its harsh croaks, trying to decide 
whether the moving objects in the 
basket were edible parasites of some 
kind or whether they were part of 
the whole strange object — which 
was too big to attack. 

When Gaffer was a few hundred 
feet up and a thousand or so down 
the lake, Oleeny swiveled the har- 
poon launcher around. 

Now the thing had decided there 
was food to be had. It twisted in the 
air and shot toward Gaffer, neck 
bent into an ‘S’ to strike. Oleeny 
put the harpoon just before and be- 
low a front wing. The creature con- 
torted and checked itself before 
crashing into the ship, but the head 
lashed out. Men ducked from sight. 



24 



IF 




Even at this distance, Raab heard 
wood splinto-. The beast shot about 
the sky, biting at itself, and appar- 
ently got the harpoon out. Then it 
turned back toward Gaffer, and this 
time it stayed wide while it labored 
for altitude. Raab was clenching his 
hands until they hurt. If it ripped the 
bag open . 

But the thing’s flying became er- 
ratic and more and more desperate. 
It screamed in frustrated rage, but 
it was falling. Finally it set its wings 
and glided down to hit the surface 
of the lake. 

There was some thrashing, then it 
was still. It didn’t submerge, which 
meant it was dead. 

Reger said, “There be many of 
those abouts here. Skipper?” 

“No,” Raab told him, “it’s the 
first I’ve ever seen at this altitude. 
It must have chased something in 
here, and been too exhausted to go 
home right away. Surprising it could 
fly at all in this air.” 

Gaffer turned and headed back. 
Raab wondered what he was going 
to say to Ben — it was a little em- 
barrassing to have had to depend on 
him like this. 

As if Reger had read his thoughts, 
the little man said, “That Sprake. 
He don’t mean you good. Skipper.” 
Raab flushed a little. “Ben? I’ve 
known him all my life!” 

“Just the same . well, you 
watch him. Skipper. I ain’t going to 
say more.” 

Vffl 

■flight days later, Gaffefs bag was 
^ as rigid as safety permitted. 



Now he was ready to head west 
around the blockade. 

Since he didn’t know the gorges 
very far in that direction, he’d even- 
tually have to lift to sky level. 
However, he did know a fairly di- 
rect gorge route for thirty miles, and 
he thought he’d take it. It involved 
crossing a rich floater lake, so he’d 
have to go at night. There was a 
technique for navigating gorges at 
night (if they were known to be un- 
blocked and fairly vertical), which 
consisted of fixing f end-poles to the 
basket, sticking out to either side, 
with flexible wands on the ends that 
could scrape audibly against the 
rock walls without breaking. 

By midnight, feeling their way 
along thus, they were nearing the 
Floater lake. They lifted over the 
falls that emptied it, and saw ahead, 
through the narrow opening of the 
gorge, bright moonlight shining on 
the opposite wall of the lake valley. 

The two big moons were fuller 
now, and rising earlier. For cau- 
tion’s sake, Raab slowed down. 
“Half-altern! Take us in at quarter 
speed, and as quietly as possible.” 

Gaffer inched toward the opening. 
Then Raab smelled wood smoke. 

He hesitated, on the point of or- 
dering a back-track. Oleeny, sensing 
his tenseness, whispered, “What is 
it. Skipper? Are we — oh! I smell it! 
Uh, could it be a natural fire?” 

“At this season?” But Raab let 
the possibility run through his mind. 
There’d been no lightning storms for 
months; anyway, growing things were 
too green, in places like this, to burn 
easily. There hadn’t been active vol- 
canoes for ages. No; it had to be 



PRISONERS OF THE SKY 



25 




campfires. And they could hardly 
belong to anyone but the Links. 

He knew it wasn’t prudent, but 
he didn’t want to sneak away with- 
out having a look. 

, ‘‘Back in a minute,” he told Olee- 
ny, and groped his way aft. “Half- 
altem, I want to emerge over the 
lake very quietly, at about half a 
mile above the water, and turn right 
immediately at half speed. I want 
to stay within fifty feet of the wall, 
but not much closer. We won’t have 
the feelers.” 

Ben’s voice was petulant. “How 
can I do that? This is the dark side 
of the lake!” 

“There’ll be enough reflected light 
to see by.” Raab gave him no more 
time to protest, but went back for- 
ward. 

T his was another case where rock 
— between two parallel cracks 
— had been undercut and finally 
collapsed. The valley was four miles 
wide, about thirty long. The rubble 
had filled in the gap to about three 
miles from sky level, or a little less. 
Then the two parallel rivers had 
joined to make a lake, deposit sedi- 
ment, cut away at the spine of high- 
er rock left at the middle and finally 
reach some sort of equilibrium. Now 
the lake was fairly shallow, with a 
mud bottom that supported Floater 
plants (via long roots) and a string 
of islands up the middle. Some of 
the latter had accumulated soil 
around them, and so were wooded. 

The one where the Links had 
made camp was two or three miles 
op the lake from the outlet. 

The first thing Raab saw, as Gaf- 



fer crept up the east wall, was two 
great fat Hens, tied down at the 
upper end of the small beach. Then 
he saw six fighting blimps, inland 
from the beach, floating above the 
strip of trees (undoubtedly because 
there wasn’t room to tie down). 
There were two fires near the Hens, 
and four others farther down the 
beach. At this distance he couldn’t 
make out human figures except as 
moving dots, but it appeared they 
were having a wine bout. 

Where were the gliders? 

Finally he spotted them at the 
edge of the beach. Twenty of them 
in a line, barely illuminated by the 
fires. 

He couldn’t tell whether the fight- 
ing blimps were manned at 

all. Usually at least a few 

men would stay aboard when the 
ships weren’t tied at ground level. 
But there’d be rope ladders dang- 
ling, and it would take the carous- 
ing men a while to climb them. 

He jerked his mind out of that 
channel. He wasn’t leading any at- 
tack squadron; he had Gaffer, with 
one harpoon launcher and two hand- 
bows. Each of those fighting blimps 
down there had eight launchers on 
a side. 

What was a squadron like that 
doing here? Getting helium for one 
thing, of course. But Hens were 
slow. When they came for gas they 
usually didn’t bring their gliders, and 
didn’t have fighting blimps along 
with them, slowed to their pace un- 
less they needed escorts. And there 
was certainly no one in a position 
to attack two Mederlink Hens, even 
unescorted. 



26 



IF 




The probability was that the Links 
knew Gaffer sneaked off Lowry, and 
dispatched this group to patrol the 
nearby Floater lakes. The gliders 
meant a sky watch, too. 

Well, he’d seen them. And they 
evidently didn’t take their patrol 
very seriously, and the thing for him 
to do was go on quietly up the lake 
before the moons rose any higher, 
and be safely to the west before 
morning. 

He paused, on the point of giving 
the orders, and stared a moment 
longer at the impudently unguarded 
camp. And there was an intoxication 
in his blood that made his head a 
little fuzzy, and made his breathing 
deep and uncomfortable. He let out 
an unhappy sigh. Was there any 
chance that this was a trap? 

The odds were very much against 
that. 

Just one running pass . Four 
or five harpoons; and ordinary ar- 
rows, falling almost vertically, would 
pierce gasbags too. And there were 
those gliders, so beautifully lined up, 
floating. A few sacks of ballast, slit 
open and raining gravel, some of it 
coarse enough to crash through a 
wing . 

H e knew he was being a fool. But 
he turned and went aft, and 
told Ben Sprake, “I want a course 
along that beach, at the edge, espe- 
cially over the gliders. About two 
thousand feet as we pass over. A 
dive first, to get all the speed pos- 
sible. Then — ” 

Sprake’s gasp and low cry inter- 
rupted him. “You, uh — you can’t 
be serious!” 



The intoxication swirled through 
Raab’s brain. “Why not? It’ll take 
them fifteen minutes to get the first 
blimp lifting! And look at the area 
they’ll have to search. There’s a 
narrow gorge off the west side, 
about five miles up, and we’ll be 
there before the moonlight’s down 
to the water on that side, and — ” 

Cudebek’s voice broke in. “Hold 
on there. Skipper. We didn’t sign 
on to fight. We’re civilians.” 

Raab’s words galloped on. “N jt 
now you’re not! I’m in command of 
a Fleet unit, and we’re in contact 
with the enemy, and I have the 
power to conscript you. You’re now 
Fleetmen.” 

The hush was a palpable thing. I 
mustn’t do it like this, with a heavy 
whip, he told himself. He took a 
deep breath and tried to speak calm- 
ly- 

“Let me explain things to you 
This task force here is looking for 
us. Before dawn, those Hens will 
lift to three miles above ground 
level. With that, and with what 
breezes and thermals they can find, 
the gliders will range sixty miles or 
more in all directions, and be able 
to see thirty miles more. We won’t 
be able to poke our nose into day- 
light. And there aren’t any charted 
gorge routes we can take. We’ll have 
to travel at night only. Meanwhile 
they’re apt to find one of the places 
we cut Floaters, and know for sure 
we’re in the area.” He realized with 
a shock he was exaggerating, but 
plunged on. “Half the blockade will 
be after us then. But if we puncture 
those Hens, it’ll be two days, maybe 
more, before they’re patched and 



PRISONERS OF THE SKY 



27 




pumped up again.” He felt shame 
and added, “Besides — that’s the 
enemy! That’s Mederlink. We’ve got 
a chance to hit them, slow them 
down a little, without adding to our 
own risks. We’ll actually gain a few 
days.” He paused, wishing he could 
see their faces. “It isn’t that I want 
to compel you.” 

After a minute, some one said, 
“I didn’t sign on to fight.” 

There was a period of muttering 
and argument, in which Raab had 
to remind them to hold their voices 
down. Finally Cudebek said heavily, 
“We’ll vote on it. Would you try to 
conscript us against our will?” 
Raab hesitated. It was hard to 
know just how to apply pressure 
without antagonizing them even 
more. Finally he said, “No. I won’t 
try to force you. But you’ve read 
the Articles of War. As citizens, 
you’ll be responsible — not to me or 
to the Fleet, but to the Govern- 
ment — if you refuse.” 

There was more growling. Finally 
Willy Wainer spoke up. “I got an 
eight-year-old sister back on the 
mesa. I been watching her get skin- 
nier every day; that’s one reason I 
signed up. I’ll fight.” 

Cudebek said, “So will I, if a 
majority’s for it. Let’s vote.” 

One by one, the voices chimed 
in. “I’m for it!” “Me too!” “You’re 
a bunch of damned fools! We’ll all 
get killed!” “Shut up! Jump out if 
you want to!” “I’ll fight!” 

Cudebek chuckled. “A majority 
for it. What do we do?” 

Raab fought to control his excite- 
ment. “Mostly, just paddle like hell 
when the time comes. I’ll want you 



personally, I guess, to use one of 
the bows.” 

Little Pokey Reger said in an mar 
steady voice, ‘T sure never though^ 
I’d be a Fleetman.” 

G affer slid down toward Ae is- 
land. Raab, at the forward 
rail working to get the harpoon 
launcher unmounted and transferred 
to the port side, wiped sweaty hands 
on his uniform. 

He hadn’t been entirely honest 
with the men. There might be blimps 
already in the air, guarding the 
camp. There might even be a third 
Hen aloft, her gliders flying by 
moonlight. Or, quite possibly, at two 
thousand feet and more (he dared 
go no lower, as he needed some al- 
titude to escape) he might not score 
a single hit with harpoon or arrow. 
And the number of exits from the 
lake valley weren’t unlimited, after 
all. 

Reflected moonlight was bright 
enough here so he could see his own 
hands easily, and that worried him. 
If there were anyone alert on watch 
. , Now he could hear the shouts 
and singing. He hurriedly finished 
mounting the launcher, cranked it 
up and slid a harpoon into place. 
Oleeny was ready with one of the 
hand-bows; Cudebek, midships, with 
the other. Raab craned his neck to 
make sure they were aligned with 
the parked gliders. They were; 
Sprake, though obviously frightened 
and furious, was doing a good job. 
There was a very slight roll. Now 
that he thought about it, that 
wouldn’t hurt. It would help spread 
the gravel in a wider path. 



28 



IF 




They were getting close. 

He watched two men wrestling 
near one of the fires. If that only 
kept the Links’ attention for another 
few minutes ... He wiped his hands 
again, seized the handles of the 
launcher and twisted it down and 
forward, one of the bulging Hens in 
the sight. 

Automatically he let go with one 
hand to pluck at the great braids 
of rubber, making sure the tension 
was equal on each side. They thrum- 
med identically. He tried to visualize 
how much the trajectory would 
curve if he shot now. Wait a little? 
No; time was too short. He squeez- 
ed the trigger and the basket jarred 
slightly as the big, vaned harpoon 
streaked away. 

He cranked frantically, fumbled 
for another missile. Oleeny sent an 
arrow arching out ahead. Too far 
for much hope, but there were plen- 
ty of arrows. Raab shot again, at 
another compartment of the closer 
Hen. He couldn’t see his first har- 
poon until it struck, just aft of the 
nose. He felt like shouting as the 
fabric split, then flapped outward. 
The two Links stopped fighting and 
whirled. Figures were leaping into 
motion all over the camp now. He 
threw a glance toward the fighting 
blimps as he cranked a third time. 
No action there yet. Now the shouts 
began to reach him. He slammed 
another harpoon into place, but let 
the weapon hang while he lunged 
forward to slash at ballast sacks. 
Damn! He should have had another 
man forward to do that. He called 
aft, “Gravel!” and hoped Trimmer 
Sols Vannyer would act fast. At the 



launcher again, he shot nearly 
straight down. There were other 
punctures now, as Cudebek or Olee- 
ny got lucky arrow-hits. 

The place was a chaos. Links 
were scrambling up rope ladders 
now. He got reloaded, swiveled the 
weapon and shot at the second Hen. 
He couldn’t see whether his second 
and third missiles had hit or not, 
but the first Hen was losing plump- 
ness fast. He cranked, knowing 
there’d be only one more shot, and 
aimed very carefully. 

Rigging creaked now as Oleeny 
and Vannyer hauled at the constricT- 
ing-wheels to compensate for the lost 
ballast. Raab leaned over the rail, 
squinting back at the parked gliders. 
If any of them were damaged, he 
couldn’t see it from here. Cudebek 
sent a last arrow arching aft, then 
took his place at a paddle. Sprake 
picked up the tempo until the men 
grunted with effort. One of the 
fighting blimps was manned now, 
and a Link was slashing at the ropes 

R aab seized Oleeny’s arm. “Can 
you stand half a turn more?” 
“Yep.” Shaft and wheel protested 
as Oleeny hauled on the spokes. 

Raab had been too enthusiastic, 
he knew, with the gravel. He should 
have kept half the forward ballast. 
He daren’t lift into thinner air now, 
even if he wanted to. 

He stared aft. The fighting blimp 
was rising fast, its paddles straining, 
its launchers beginning to swing 
away from the rails. It rose out of 
sight. Two more were ascending 
now. Gaffer was still slanting down, 
on the same course. 



PRISONERS OF THE SKY

It all depended on whether they 
had him in sight. If they did, they’d 
simply overtake Gaffer and riddle 
her. If not, they’d expect him to 
turn, and more than likely to lift 
skyward as fast as he could. 

Since he couldn’t see them, he 
couldn’t know. His ears strained for 
the woosh of harpoons. The shout- 
ing at the camp was beyond hearing 
now, but he could hear signal flutes 
from there, and answers from some 
of the blimps. One Hen was deflat- 
ed to her inner cells. The other was 
limp forward, but only sagging a 
little midships and aft, probably just 
an arrow hit or two. They’d be 
swarming over her, patching those 
before she lost more gas. 

What was above Gaffer? If they 
had lost sight (surely they’d seen 
her by firelight as she passed over) 
they might be going on up. The far- 
ther they went, the less chance 
they’d see Gaffer in the shadow. 
And if they got into actual moon- 
light, they might as well be blind. 

It seemed to him now that he’d 
been an incredibly optimistic fool. 
There was nothing better to do than 
take the gorge he’d originally had 
in mind, to the west. Would they 
know that gorge? Wouldn’t they 
guess he was going west, around the 
blockade? They should — already he 
was far west of Lowry, which was 
a plain clue. 

It depended on how fast they 
thought, he supposed. He slumped 
on the forward rail, brooding over 
it. He felt tired now, and drained of 
courage. He could navigate that nar- 
row gorge by feelers, but where it 
ended — where the charts ended. 



rather — he’d have to lift clear ot 
he’d simply lose himself in twisting 
mazes. 

Not at the end. The charts showed 
the sharp turn there, which would 
be plain enough to the Links even 
in starlight. So, he’d have to lift five 
miles or so this side; enough so they 
wouldn’t (assuming they followed 
that gorge, above it) be waiting. 

Maybe he wouldn’t even go that 
far. A couple of hours after mid- 
night, the moons would be past the 
zenith, but still high, so Gaffer 
wouldn’t be so well lit from the 
side. He’d take his chances that they 
weren’t watching that particular 
spot. 

But there was the problem of the 
ballast . 

Only one thing to do about that. 
The river, above the lake, would 
provide gravel. They’d hide Gaffer 
in shadow, and gather ballast by 
moonlight. Or should he let that go, 
and valve helium instead for a lower 
(and safer) pressure at higher alti- 
tudes? 

No; he wasn’t going to give up 
the painfully collected gas. He start- 
ed aft to give Ben the necessary or- 
ders, but Cudebek heard him, and, 
between grunts of exertion, got out, 
“Skipper, when can I talk to you?” 

Raab halted, annoyed. “Why, as 
soon as we’re safe. We’ve got to 
refill ballast sacks, then get away 
from this vicinity. There’s no time 
to waste because we have to dodge 
the moonlight.” 

Cudebek’s voice was ugly. “This 
won’t wait, Garan!” 

Raab suppressed anger. He 
couldn’t afford a shouting match

now. He stood tiiere, torn between 
tfae urge to keep going, and the rec- 
ognition diat being rou^ with the 
^kesman conld mean trouble tider. 
After a moment he said bru^y, 
“As soon as we’re tied down.** 

DC 

H e kept them pulling farther than 
he’d originally intended, to 
where a bend would keep the moon- 
light from striking the river at all. 
It was very dark here; they had to 
tie down by feel. A couple of hun- 
dred yards downstream, by his reck- 
oning, there should be enough re- 
flected light to work by. They could 
walk that far. 

First of all, allowing only one 
man out at a time, he got some 
rocks stacked in the basket so the 
Trimmers could ease off the strain 
on the constricting gear. Then they 
tied down to large boulders. 

“Now,” he demanded from Cude- 
bek, half inclined to make it plain 
that the man was under Fleet dis- 
cipline now. “What’s so urgent?” 
Cudebek said flatly, “Someone’s 
stolen my knife.” 

Raab checked an angry curse. He 
said instead, “Your knife? Why . 
it probably fell out of the scabbard 
when you were shooting arrow! Or 
when you moved around!” 

Cudebek fairly snarled at him. 
“Damn it, Garan, don’t you think 
I know how to keep a scabbard 
buttoned?” 

Raab’s face grew hot. “You’ll ad- 
dress me as ‘Skipper’ or ‘Sir’! I’ll 
order everyone out, and you can feel 
around the deck yourself.” 



Cudebek said, his voice murder- 
ous, “It won’t be on the deck. I 
want everyone stripped and search- 
ed. And I want all the cargo gone 
over.** 

Raab’s anger broke free. “You 
complete fool! Do you think we’re 
going to light all the lanterns and 
make a search here? Why in God’s 
name did you bring a knick-knack 
like that anyway? Did you think this 
was a women’s and children’s out- 
ing? Feel around the deck if you 
want to. Otherwise, shut up and get 
to work looking for gravel.” 

He realized suddenly that he had 
his hand on the hilt of his own 
knife, ready for a challenge. Thank 
God it was too dark for anyone to 
see that. But his raised voice alone 
was shame enough; that wasn’t the 
way a Skipper acted. He said, with 
more control, “All the rest of you 
out. We’ve got to mend the sacks 
first of all.” As a sudden after- 
thought, he added, “if anyone does 
have Cudebek’s knife. I’d suggest 
putting it quietly back on his seat 
when no one’s looking. Theft in 
combat carries the death penalty. I 
won’t hesitate just because we’re 
short-handed.” 

They got the gravel. Cudebek had 
felt his way over the ship and was 
ominously quiet as they prepared to 
lift. In order to get where Raab 
wanted to be by midnight, they had 
to risk going back downstream dur- 
ing the few minutes when moonlight 
shone directly in. They reached the 
westward-running gorge he wanted, 
and turned into it. He lifted to with- 
in half a mile of the top, and kept 
the men rowing harder than he had

to. That turned out to be unfor- 
tunate, because they had a wait be- 
fore it was time to lift clear out. 
And as soon as they slowed down 
Ben Sprake said, wiA a mixture of 
emotions competing in his voice, 
“Sir, as Second in Command, and 
with concurrence of a majority of 
the crew, I invoke the right of 
Question.” 

A fter his first instinctive anger, 
Raab found he was neither 
deeply furious nor surprised. He gave 
himself a moment, then said coolly, 
“I grant the right. Just what is it 
you want to question?” 

Ben said hesitantly, “Uh, your 
orders. We weren’t — that is, we feel 
you’ve exceeded your orders.” 

“Oh?” Raab had never felt this 
kind of cool, controlled anger be- 
fore. “Are you sure you know ex- 
actly what my orders were?” 

Jon Cudebek spoke up. “As crew 
spokesman, I’d like to talk, Skip- 
per.” His voice in the darkness was 
precise and cold. 

Raab told him, “Now that you’re 
Fleetmen, you don’t rate a spokes- 
man. Go ahead, though, and have 
your say.” 

The burly man said, “When we 
signed on we were told we’d make 
every effort to avoid the enemy. As 
long as it was put that definitely, I 
think your orders must have been 
along the same lines.” 

Raab considered for a minute. 
“Just who’s making this protest? 
You, Cudebek? Or Half-altern 
Sprake?” 

It was a loaded question. The 
crew could be punished for mutiny. 



whether they were right about the 
orders or not, if a Board of Inquiry 
so decided. Sprake, as Second in 
Command, would be held as widiin 
his duty if his action were found 
to be in accord with facts. 

After a minute Ben said sullenly, 
“Well, uh, I am, sir.” 

“All right,” Raab said. “Can you 
quote my orders? Did you see a 
written copy ” 

“No, sir.” Hesitantly. 

“Then,” Raab said, “actually, 
you’re protesting on behalf of the 
crew. Is that it?” 

“Well, yes, sir.” 

“Fine. Now that that’s established, 
just what is it you all want? Should 
we go back and apologize to the 
Links for hitting them? Or do you 
want to sneak home without even 
trying for any guano?” 

Ben was silent. Finally Cudebek 
put in, “If I may speak again, Skip- 
per. What we want is a guarantee 
that we are going after guano, and 
nothing else. That’s what we signed 
on for. Not to go around looking 
for fights. Even if the odds weren’t 
so, uh, ridiculous, we think that’s 
the Fleet’s job. And I don’t think 
you can conscript us the way you 
did, and be backed up once we get 
home.” 

“I’ll remind you,” Raab said, “that 
you voted. But let’s forget that. Will 
you accept an assurance that we’ll 
try to avoid any more contact with 
the Links?” 

Cudebek said in the same politely 
hostile voice, “Not quite. Skipper. 
I understand we can refuse if you 
try to order us into any more 
fights.”

IF 




Raab smiled grimly m the dark. 
“Not exactly. If I commit gross mis- 
conduct, or treason, ot directly dis- 
obey my orders — and you don’t 
know those — ^Half-altern Sprake can 
take over command, with the con- 
currence of two-thirds the crew. But 
you’ll face an Inquiry at home, and 
Mr. Sprake will have to represent 
you. If he’s willing.” 

Ben said angrily, ‘Tm invoking 
the question!” 

“Um,” Raab said noncommittally. 
“All right, we’ll leave it that way. 
Now, it’s time to lift out of this 
trench. Half-altern, since you con- 
template taking over command in 
the future, you’d better get some 
experience. Will you take her up 
and set a course west?” 

T here was a charged silence in 
the basket. The feelers scraped 
rock as Gaffer rose. Now the cleft 
became faintly lighted as moonlight 
from above bounced from wall to 
wall. 

Sprake’s voice was nervous as he 
directed the paddlers. Another quar- 
ter-mile up and he ordered hesitant- 
ly, “One-half turn constriction, fore 
and aft.” The lift slowed and Gaffer 
hung, ready to start down again. 
Ben ordered a quarter-turn off, and 
she rose very slowly. 

Relaxed at the forward rail, Raab 
grinned to himself. If you wanted 
to dwell on it, the rigging did creak 
a trifle ominously. Of course the 
danger was that, with the bag so 
taut*, as they rose into thinner air 
the increasing expansion of the he- 
lium would break constricting-lines, 
or tear them loose from the shaft. 



Even worse, with an old, patetod- 
and-repatched bag Mke Gaffer's, tiie 
swelling helium might rupture the 
bag. 

The li^t brightened. Far down 
the gorge, Raab ooidd see, beneath 
the bag’s nc«e, a stretch of brightly 
lit rim. They cm^t to emerge very 
slowly and oeep akmg close to die 
ground (which was mostly rocky 
l»re) to be as inamsi^uous as pos- 
sible. 

He knew all those things were 
churning in B«q’s mind. 

A minute later Ben burst out, 
“Sir, may I valve a little gas?” 
Raab said curtly, “You’re tem- 
porarily in command. Half -altera.” 
They were very near the top. 
Sprake, with a toui^ of panic, siud, 
“Raab, I’m not familiar with the 
ship! I’d like to valve a little gas 
and drop a little ballast!” 

Raab allowed himself a chuckle. 
“That’s up to you. But rem^nber 
we’H be going to sea level. You 
can’t afford to throw away too modi 
gas. And you haven’t much ballast 
to spare, either,” 

The silence resumed. Then Sprake 
said furiously, “Sr, I don’t know 
how much this ship will stand. Will 
you take over?” 

“VVhy, yes, if you wish, Half- 
altern.” Raab arose, climbed to the 
rail, stood up and thumped the bag, 
more for effect than anything else. 
“Off a quarter-turn, fore and aft. 
Mr. Sprake, as soon as we emarge 
I’ll set the course, then I’d like you 
to call cadence if you feel up to it.” 
He could think of many clever 
things he might say. Instead, he 
calmly got them headed west, then 



PRISONERS OF THE SKY 



33 




let Ben take over. The lesson would 
speak for itself. 

Ben’s voice, mumbling cadence, 
sounded almost tearful. Raab, relax- 
ed again forward, examined his own 
feelings with wonder. He didn’t seem 
to feel any sympathy at all for Ben. 
Nor for Cudebek — it was too bad 
the man had lost his knife, but that 
wasn’t Raab’s responsibility. And he 
and Ben had challenged Raab’s au- 
thority. Ben, he thought, was thor- 
oughly put in his place now, but 
Cudebek might need a little disci- 
pline. 

He was amazed and vaguely 
ashamed at his own hardness. 

X 

S ix more days had passed. Five 
had seen Gaffer fighting her way 
westward and seaward against 
breezes that wouldn’t have bother- 
ed a better-shaped, better-manned 
blimp. One had been spent on an 
unsettled small mesa, when the pad- 
dlers were exhausted and on the 
point of rebellion. 

Just before dawn of the seventh 
day, Raab stood at the forward rail 
peering ahead for the island he had 
in mind. He’d tried to time things 
so they’d arrive earlier in the day 
than gliders were likely to be flying. 
But the island wasn’t in sight, and 
if he didn’t spot it soon he’d simply 
have to risk lifting higher to get a 
more distant horizon. 

He moodily pondered the future. 
He’d fill the ballast sacks with gua- 
no, and, when they reached Lowry, 
try to lift to the top with as much 
as possible. He didn’t look forward 



to making the same long roundabout 
trip back. Rather, he thought he’d 
try to reach the seaward edge in two 
nights. That would mean lying at sea 
level during one day, hoping he 
wouldn’t be spotted, then pulling 
hard for the mesa as soon as the 
sun went down. On the seaward 
side, there were updrafts that would 
add a little to his lift. 

He scowled, sweeping his gaze 
along the horizon. He must have 
misjudged it badly. He glanced to- 
ward the pale orange glow in the 
east. Fifteen minutes until the sun 
poked up. 

Then he found the small dot on 
the horizon, and his mood bright- 
ened. “Half-altern, forty degrees 
left. And let’s push it.” 

The sun was an hour up when 
they crossed above the bare rocky 
ridge of the island to settle by a 
grove of trees where Gaffer could 
be camouflaged. That took another 
hour, but there hadn’t been any 
sight of blimps or gliders. They had 
a late breakfast, and he considered 
giving the crew a day of rest, but 
decided he’d get the guano dug and 
sacked up first, so they’d be ready 
to leave. He called the crew togeth- 
er and gave instructions. 

“Stay off the higher rocks unless 
you’re on lookout. Don’t scare up 
clouds of birds. Look for deposits 
that have washed down and have 
grass sprouting from them, but that 
aren’t too wet. If you hear a flute, 
get out of sight and get back to the 
ship as fast as you can. Half-altern, 
I’ll draw you a sketch of the south 
end of the island, and you can take 
half the men. I’ll take the others

north. Oleeny, you stay with the 
ship.** 

R aab posted one of his men less 
than a mile from Gaffer, then 
led the rest on about an equal dis- 
tance. They’d reached a good de- 
posit and were starting work, when, 
from farther along the island, some- 
one hailed them. 

Raab jerked upright and stared at 
a band of gaunt, bearded men in 
tattered Fleet uniforms, at the edge 
of another grove. He dropped the 
bag he was holding and ran in that 
direction, calling over his shoulder, 
“Come on!” 

When he was within fifty yards 
of the castaways, one of them recog- 
nized him. “Garan! Raab Garan!” 
Raab stared at the grinning emaciat- 
ed face. “Why — good God; Nik 
Roos! What in — Trimmer, you were 
reported dead!” 

The two groups met and there 
was a babble of happy curses, jokes 
and handshakes all around. Trimmer 
Roos told Raab breathlessly, “We 
were riddled and falling before we 
knew what hit us. The Links were 
going over low, shooting survivors, 
but eleven of us hid inside the bag. 
Then that night we chopped up the 
basket and made a raft, enough to 
keep us afloat, anyway. I remember- 
ed this island and didn’t think they’d 
be looking this far west, and we 
made it. Nine of us did, that is. A 
big triphib got two. Another’s died 
since. When we saw Gaffer coming 
this morning . .” He sobered. 
“Things must be bad, eh? Did your 
father make it back to Mesa Lowry 
all right?” 



Raab said, “He died on the re- 
treat.” 

Roos looked at the ground silent- 
ly for a moment. “I’m scwry to hear 
that, Raab. Somebody signaled he 
was hurt. And it looked as if what 
was left of the Fleet would have to 
fight all the way home, if they made 
it at all.” He looked up again, eyes 
blazing. “But as long as you’re stitt 
holding out, I guess you got the 
traitors.” 

Raab seized his arm fiercely. 
“Roos! Do you know who it was? 
They — my father was accused!” 

“What?” Roos looked incredulous. 
The others stood in a silent circle. 
“Why, those . .” Trimmer Roos 
snarled, “You can be damned sure 
I know who they are! When we get 
back — ” His face changed. “But 
you’ll be here for guano, and you’ve 
only got Gaffer” 

Raab frowned at him. “Eh? Oh! 
Why, don’t be stupid! Of course 
we’re taking you back! Do you think 
we’(| — why, hell; none of you 
weigh very much, from the looks of 
you. Any guano we take back will 
be only be a token, anyway. Say, 
why don’t you all go on back to 
Gaffer and get yourselves a decent 
meal? We’ve got greens and fruit, 
and plenty of cooked fresh-water 
’phibs. Ammet Oleeny’s on watch 
there.” He grinned. “I think you 
know him.” 

Roos chortled. “Ammet?” Polite- 
ness struggled with hunger and the 
prospect of seeing an old buddy. 
“Well, sir ...” 

Raab gave him a shove. “Go on. 
We’ll sack up a little guano and be 
along in an hour.” 



36 



IF 




R aab was too excited to care 
about guano now. They’d just 
fill a few sacks, and . now that 
he thought of it, they wouldn’t have 
to jettison it completely, as ballast. 
There were a few ledges partway up 
the mesa’s sides, where he could 
drop some of it. Maybe a blimp 
could sneak down later and pick it 
up. The main thing was to get Nik 
Roos and his companions home, so 
they could talk. 

Almost incoherent, he hustled his 
men along and they started back 
with a dozen filled sacks. But when 
they’d gone part way, he heard Nik 
Roos shouting his name again. The 
Trimmer, panting and staggering 
with exhaustion, burst into sight. 
“Raab! Oleeny’s been murdered and 
Gaffer’s flat!” 

XI 

R aab, feeling dazed, stared down 
at the body. Oleeny lay on his 
back, feet near the basket, as if he’d 
been facing it and had fallen or 
been pulled over backward. His 
throat was slashed almost to the 
spine. The blood on the ground was 
congealed, and he wasn’t bleeding 
any more. There was a mark on one 
temple as if he’d been clubbed un- 
conscious before his throat was cut. 
He must have been killed shortly 
after Raab and the others had left. 

Raab felt physically sick with 
remorse. How could he have been 
so stupid as to leave one man alone 
on watch? Slowly, he turned to Nik 
Roos. “You’re sure there’s no one 
else on the island?” 

Nik pulled his gaze away from 



the body. **Of course. WeVe been 
here two years.” He cdored. “You 
don’t think one of us — ?” 

Raab made an impatient gesture. 
“Of course not” He turned and 
stared toward the sea. “Could some- 
one have . No; it has to be one 
of my crew. Maybe more than one. 
From the other half.” Dull anger 
began to replace his daze. How 
many? Why had he let Cudebek 
and Sols Vannyer go with Sprake? 
They were both hostile, and might 
be traitors for all he knew. 

Nik said, “Why didn’t they take 
the ship and leave us stranded?” 

Raab’s mind began to work. He 
strode to the basket, made sure both 
hand-bows were there. “Because 
there weren’t enough of them, ob- 
viously. As many as three could 
have taken her up, and paddled 
enough for heading. They could 
have just drifted until the Links 
spotted them. If there are patrols 
this far west.” 

Roos said, “There are patrols, all 
right. Every four days. Blimps and 
gliders.” After a minute he added, 
“So, one man or two. And they plan 
to signal, and be picked up by the 
Links — with the rest of us.” 

Raab nodded slowly, and turned 
to stare at Gaffer again. The bag 
could be mended, all right; but most 
of the helium was gone. Only the 
inner cells — which wouldn’t lift the 
basket alone, even without crew or 
cargo — kept the bag from being 
completely flat. He turned, shaking 
with anger, to Nik. “Maybe we 
should let them signal, but be watch- 
ing. Or — maybe we can lure a 
blimp down some way! Even if we 



PRISONERS OF THE SKY 



37 




had to hole it, we could get enough 
gas for Gaffer! Do you have any 
weapons on the island?” 

Nik shrugged. “Two hand-bows 
we brought.” 

“That makes four,” Raab said, be- 
ginning to feci excited, “And the 
launcher. And we can make other 
bows, and — ” 

Nik shook his head. “Hardly. 
There hasn’t be«i a lone blimp over 
since we’ve bc«i here. The patrol’s 
a full unit; Hens and gliders and 
fighting blimps. They come by late 
in the day, as if they’re on the way 
back to base.” 

“Oh,” Raab said dejectedly. Then 
his head snapped up suddenly. 
“Base? What do you mean?” 

Roos gave him a quick glance. 
“Didn’t you know? They’ve got an 
island base somewhere. I think it 
must be Mell Island, from the di- 
rection they take. There’s nothing 
else near with greens and fruit and 
game. And it would be a handy lo- 
cation.” 

Raab nodded, dejected again. It 
would be a good location, if one had 
plenty of helium for lifting, and the 
Links had plenty. It explained some 
things about the blockade, and also 
explained the task force he’d hit on 
the lake. So maybe they hadn’t been 
looking for him, after all. 

Well, a base that near put him 
and his crew in even a worse fix. 
He certainly hadn’t turned out to be 
beginning to understand why Ad- 
beaten. He could imagine now, for 
much of a hero, he mused. He was 
miral Kline, and others, acted so 
had felt, mortally wounded, seeing 
the first time, how his own father 



the Fleet shot to pieces around him, 
desperately gathering together what 
he could salvage for an almost hop^ 
less fighting retreat. Maybe Com- 
mand wasn’t a desirable thing, after 
all. 

But he, Raab, had asked for it; 
it was up to him to do what he 
could. “Maybe,” he said wearily, 
“we’d better just round up the rest 
of my crew and keep them under 
guard.” A little of his anger return- 
ed. “I’ll question them one at a time! 
Maybe I’ll find out something.” 

T he others were vituperative at 
being herded under weapons, 
until they saw Oleeny’s body and 
the condition of Gaffer. Raab ad- 
dressed them first of all in a group. 
“At least one of you is a murderer 
and a traitor. I’m going to ask each 
one of you, separately, for any in- 
formation you can give me that 
might point to some and clear the 
rest. You understand I haven’t any 
choice but to keep you all under 
guard meanwhile. Anyone who re- 
sists or tries to escape will be killed 
on the spot.” 

Later, after long hours of inter- 
rogating, he sat down for a late 
evening meal and to discuss things 
with Nik Roos. “Well, unless all of 
them are lying, we can definitely 
clear two or three. No more.” 

Roos agreed. “What about Ben 
Sprake? Excuse me, I know he’s an 
officer. But he acts pretty vague 
about where he was at what time, 
and he seems to have a lot on his 
mind. And the others can’t pinpoint 
him very well either.” 

Raab shrugged. “True. But I be- 



38 



IF 




Scve his story diat he went to dieck 
on his lookout, then moved from 
group to group. He’s very mad at 
me for something that happened be- 
fore we got here, but I can’t see him 
as a murderer, or a traitor. Actual- 
ly, it’s my fault for not telling him 
to keep his group together.” He cut 
a small chunk of cold meat and 
chewed it without enthusiasm. 

“What about this Jon Cudebek?” 
Nik asked. 

Raab said, “Possibly. But Oleeny 
would probably have been suspicious 
of him in particular. As I see it, 
someone Oleeny had no reason to 
mistrust came and asked him for 
something out of the basket — prob- 
ably said Sprake had sent him — 
then, when Ammet bent over the 
rail to get it, clubbed him. Well, I’m 
going to get some rest, then take 
the late watch. Are you satisfied 
with the guard arrangements?” 

Roos said, “They’re as ' good as 
they can be. The only thing is, Ben 
Sprake outranks all of us except 
you. By the way, I haven’t congrat- 
ulated you.” 

“Thanks,” Raab said bitterly. 
“I’ve told Sprake what to expect if 
he misbehaves.” 

H e knew he wasn’t going to sleep. 
He didn’t. 

There were so many things he had 
to think about just to keep from be- 
ing discovered by the patrols. Gaf- 
fer’s camouflage would have to be 
renewed every few days; and the 
foliage couldn’t be taken from where 
it would show. Cook-fires, and any 
fishing or egg-gathering, would have 
to be handled carefully. And how 



did you guard eight or nine men so 
well that none of them could p<w- 
sibly leave any sign, without actual- 
ly keeping them tied up? He might 
have to do just that. 

And what of the long run? He 
didn’t think there was any reason a 
single blimp would land here, or 
even fly over so it could be lured 
down. How would they do the lur- 
ing, anyway? Disguise themselv^ as 
marooned Mederlink crewmen? Not 
promising. 

Could they leave this island by 
raft, get to a bigger one, with game 
and other food, outside the block- 
ade? That might permit them to die 
of old age, eventually, instead of 
malnutrition. The coast offered 
nothing. It was all jungle for thou- 
sands of miles, except for the mesas. 
And none were climbabie. 

It all came back to hdium. Would 
it be possible to reach some island 
where a single blimp might land, for 
food or fresh water? His puke quick- 
ened. Now he was beginning to 
make sense! A raft, with paddles . 
But why a raft? Why not a boat, if 
they were going to take time to 
build something? They could chop 
up Gaffer’s basket, and — no! Why 
chop it up? It would make a boat 
frame as it was! Or, build on a point- 
ed bow and stern. Cover it with the 
bag fabric — two layers, for insur- 
ance. It would be more of a barge 
than a boat, flat-bottomed, wider 
than her draft, but it would be sturdy 
and plenty big enough. The air pad- 
dles should work in water, with the 
right handling. 

He began to go over in his mind 
the suitable islands. He’d never been 



PRISONERS OF THE SKY 



39 




much farther west than this. There 
was one big island, a little farther 
west and farther out, but that was 
probably two hundred miles away. 

Mell was the only closer one. If 
Mcll weren’t already occupied . 

He gasped, rolled to his feet and 
groped through the darkness to 
where Nik Roos was on guard. “Can 
you get someone to relieve you? I 
want to talk to youl** 

Shaky with excitement, he led the 
way to an ioslated spot. “We want 
helium. The Links have it. We can’t 
lure them down here, because they’d 
be suspicious. But on Mell Island — 
which we can reach by boat — they 
wouldn’t be expecting us I” 

Roos was silent for a minute. 
“But . even if we could steal 
some gas, how’d we get Gaffer 
there? How big a boat are you talk- 
ing about?” 

Raab felt like laughing aloud. 
“We won’t worry about Gaffer. Well 
take the helium blimp and all. May- 
be we can capture the whole base!” 
Roos drew in his breath. “Good 
God! Why, that’s — no; it’s no 
more impossible than surviving 
here!” Then his voice dropped. “But 
a third of us are suspects.” 

Raab said, “I’ve got the beginning 
of a plan about that, too.” 

XII 

T hev were approaching an island 
from the windward side. It was 
not Mell Island, but few of the 
boatful knew that. He’d taken Nik 
Ross into his scheme to find the 
traitor, and he’d had to tell Ben 
Sprake because Ben knew star navi- 



gation well enough not to be fooled 
by a lie. 

He’d had less argument from 
Cudebek and the others than he’d 
expected. The story he’d given them 
was that they’d stay under restraint 
and be taken back to Lowry. He 
spoke only of stealing one blimp, 
if possible, and stressed mainly the 
food on Mell. 

He had most of the group 
bunched forward, so the bow 
wouldn’t rise and slap down hard 
every time they met a swell. If he 
ever had to build another boat, there 
were some changes he’d make. How- 
ever, at least this one had a very 
shallow draft that would make it 
easy to beach. 

They were approaching a beach 
now, in a cove that was enclosed 
by a half-circle of cliffs and heav- 
ily wooded. The wind was mild, but 
there were breakers to worry about 
The two big moons (nearly full 
now, and one of them near setting) 
lit half the cove; the other half 
looked black. 

Raab let the paddles rest for a 
minute. “We’ll go in fast, jump out 
and drag the boat up among the 
trees, then smooth out the sand be- 
hind us. We’U stay here a couple 
days and reconnoiter. The base will 
be on the other side of the island, 
and they’ll have lookout posts on 
the highest ridge. We’ll have to lo- 
cate those first of all.” 

There was no talk. Most of the 
men, not knowing the island was 
unoccupied (or so Raab assumed), 
were tense. He didn’t see any need 
to prolong their worry. “All right; 
let’s go in.”

IF 




r ie boat was hidden and their 
tracks obliterated. Raab, squeez- 
ing water out of his clothing, looked 
at the moon and made calculations. 
Less than two hours until sunup. 

He told the group, “I’m going to 
reconnoiter alone. If I’m not back 
by noon, you’d better figure you’re 
in trouble; but just in case they don’t 
come after you. I’ll teU you the clos- 
est way up the ridge. About a mile 
in the direction I’m going, there’s 
another cove, with a stream leading 
up from it that you can follow. Once 
you get out of the cove, you’d better 
leave the stream and stay in the 
thickest woods you can find. The 
other side of die island’s not so 
steep; you can get down anywhere, 
almost. I’ll stay on the right side of 
the stream as you face up it — that’s 
this side. So if I don’t make it back, 
you’d better try the other. I suggest 
you eat before sunup, then post 
pickets and stay quiet until noon. 
Got wr 

He took his knife, a Hght twenty- 
foot rope, and a small pouch of 
food. That was for show. He moved 
through the trees, not looking back 
while they could see him. As soon 
as he was out of sight he moved at 
a trot to get to the end of the cove 
as soon as possible. 

There, he stood in the fringe of 
trees a minute, scanning the narrow 
strip of beach ahead. He needed 
some hiding-place, and he had to 
leave a convincing set of tracks. He 
spotted a shallow cave that provided 
a deep shadow, and headed toward 
it. He went on past and around a 
bulge of rock, then carefully back- 
tracked, putting his feet in the same 



prints. He leaped for the shadow 
and made it without leaving exposed 
tracks. 

The surf was luminous in the 
waning light. Somewhere out over 
the sea, a small triphib kept uttering 
its harsh screech, probably seeking 
others of its kind. Raab, careful to 
stay in shadow, squirmed for a less 
uncomfortable positkm. 

His plan seemed a Htde silly now. 
All he had to bank on was that the 
traitor ought to be feehng desperate 
by now. If he didnH get away and 
reach the Links, he was likely to be 
killed with the others in some fool- 
hardy action. And even if they did 
come — if there w«e two of them 

— it occurred to him tl»t they’d be 
warned by the enchng of his tracks 
a few yards beyond. Why hadn’t he 
thought of that? 

And he suddenly saw another 
hole in his original plan, in case 
there were two. One, he’d hoped to 
overcome, by surprise, even if it was 
the burly Cudebek. But he’d thought 
two could just be abandoned on the 
island, once he knew who they were 

— he’d just let them go by, then go 
back and take the boat and the rest 
of the crew out to sea. God, he 
thought; what a numbskull I am! 
They could signal! Why don’t I ever 
think things through? 

Then, vaguely, he saw movement 
among the trees. 

T he pumping of his blood was 
almost unbearable. He had to 
take deep breaths and force himself 
to hold still. Very carefully, he drew 
his knife, gripped it for throwing. 
Now the dimly seen figure took an-

other step, and he nearly gasped 
aloud. 

It was Pokey Reger. 

His mind darted over events and 
iht crew’s statements. Yes, it was 
possible! In fact, it was Reger’s tes- 
timony, more than any other, that 
made Cudebek a suspect. His eyes 
strained to see into the shadows, 
locate a second man if there were 
one. But, after a moment, Reger 
stepped from the trees alone and 
trotted — with no sign of his former 
awkwardness — along the narrow 
beach, 

Raab’s astonishment was such 
that he almost let Reger go past 
without a challenge. But just as the 
little man came opposite, he stepped 
out of the shadow and called the 
single word, “Traitor!” 

Reger spun toward him. Raab 
started another step, intending to 
seize the man by die arms, throw 
him down and tie him so he couldn’t 
struggle. It was in his mizKl, in a dim 
way, that he’d have to be gentle with 
the little man. But then Reger’s arm 
was sweeping up like lightning, and 
Raab had a glimpse of the knife 
ready to throw. Before he could 
move, it flashed through his own 
mind that this was no clumsy little 
nothing, but a trained killer who’d 
know how to throw a knife. His own 
arm snapped up and he threw, 
quickly, mostly with his wrist. As 
soon as the knife left his hand he 
hurled himself to the side and down. 

Reger’s knife missed him by 
inches. It clanged against the cliff 
as no piece of flint ever did. His 
own knife took Reger dead center, 
in the solar plexus. Reger gave a 



suppressed cry and fell. Raab rolled 
to his feet a^ leaped toward him. 

But Reger was through. He lay 
on his side, knees partly drawn up, 
one fist clenched around the hilt 
projecting from bis middle, but not 
trying to pull the knife out. He 
breathed in shallow agonized gasps. 
He struggled to turn his head toward 
Raab, and forced the ghost of a 
grin. “I — should have — figured 
. .” His voice trailed off in a 
groan. 

It wasn’t long before the breathing 
stopped. 

S lowly Raab stooped and took 
hold of the knife. He had to 
wrench hard to get it free. In some- 
thing of a daze, he washed it in the 
surf, dried it on his uniform and put 
it in its scabbard. Then he went 
looking for the knife Reger had 
thrown. 

As he expected, it was Cudebek’s 
bronze one. He hefted it in his right 
hand. An excellent throwing wea- 
pon, no doubt; but probably Reger 
had been a little off due to its den- 
sity. To that Raab owed his life. 

He dragged die body out of sight, 
then spent fifteen minutes washing 
the blood into die sea and covering 
the spot with clean sand. Then he 
started back. 

He called ahead of him, “It’s Gar- 
an,” so they wouldn’t be startled. 
The second moon was partly set, but 
there was still light enough to see the 
question in their faces as they gath- 
ered round. He stepped forward and 
handed Cudebek the knife. 

Cudebek stared at it wordlessly, 
tfaca looked up. “Who had it?”

Raab said, “Who’s missing?” His 
voice was hoarse. 

Someone said, “Pokey Reger!” 
“You wouldn’t call him Pokey,” 
Raab said, “if you’d seen him in 
action.” 

Cudebek said, “But how — ” 

Raab found a spot and sat down. 
T doubt if we’ll ever know. The 
only thing I can think of is that he 
had it hung beneath the basket on 
a string, and dropped it the first 
time we landed, then picked it up 
again after we’d searched everything. 
Maybe he hid it in the food, or 
someplace.” He sighed. Killing your 
first man was just as shaking an ex- 
perience as he’d heard, and he didn’t 
feel up to much now, but he had to 
talk to them. “The way things work 
out, I’m sure he was alone. So now 
I can tell you that this isn’t Mell 
Island. Before we go there, I want 
you to decide whether you’re will- 
mg to take on more than just trying 
to steal one blimp.”

R aab, Ben Sprake, Nik Roos and 
Willie Waincr lay on a slope 
overlooking the Mederlink base. 
Tliey’d carefully scouted the look- 
out posts and the paths that led to 
them. Here they were reasonably 
safe from discovery. 

Steep cliffs, forming an angle, pro- 
tected two sides of the area below 
them. The slope they were concealed 
on sheltered a third side. The north 
side, facing the mainland, was open 
to the sea, with a good beach where 
gliders, landing on the smooth lee- 
ward water, could be drawn up. 



Eighteen of them lay there now, 
with mechanics worl^g on some 
of them. 

The nearly flat area was about 
two miles long and half a mile wide, 
stretching along the beach. The Base 
was at the western end, in the angle 
of the cliffs, where an area about a 
quarter-mile square had been clear- 
ed. The rest of the flat was heavily 
jungled with die typical twisting, 
dark-green trees. One half of the 
cleared area was planted widi a var- 
iety of vegetables of Eartih-descentted 
types. 

The buildings included a hangar 
(where more gliders were bemg 
worked on), an Armory, a recreatioB 
hall, a mess hall, three barracks and 
a stockade. That stockade — attach- 
ed to one of die barracks — had 
about forty prisoners in it, while as 
many more outside worked at var- 
ious jobs, under guard. Most of them 
wore unmarked fatigues, but there 
were a few each of Orket and Lowry 
Fleet unifornw, much mended. 

Moored a short distance from the 
building, near the cliff where they’d 
be sheltered from storms, were six 
fighting blimps and two Hens. It 
was not the same group Raab had 
encountered already; that one evi- 
dently hadn’t gotten back yet. That 
was a break, but it wouldn’t last. 

Near the ships, dozens of thick- 
walled balloons, rigid with helium, 
were tied. There was assorted gear, 
and tie-down spots for perhaps fif- 
teen more ships. Trodden paths led 
to five evenly spaced spots at the 
edge of the jungle. Raab said, 
“Launcher emplacements. Two men 
to a launcher?” 



MUSOKERS OF THE SKY

“Probably.” Roos said, “if they’re 
manned at all.” 

“They’ll be manned,” Raab pre- 
dicted. “If only against big triphibs 
that might come in.” He watched 
the workmen moving about. Their 
idle talk came up faintly. Now and 
then there was an outburst of laugh- 
ter from the rec hall. He arrived at 
an estimate. “Two hundred fifty 
Links and about eighty prisoners. 
Ouch.” 

Ben, who’d been very, quiet lately, 
put in, “There’ll be more if another 
group comes in from patrol.” 

R aab nodded unhappily. “We 
can’t wait that long, then.” He 
looked at Nik. “From the times 
they were over your island, when 
would you say they’re due in?” 

“Not more than three hours after 
sundown.” 

“And tonight’s the night? For 
sure?” 

“Yes, sir. Unless the one that’s 
due is the one you hit, and it’s de- 
layed.” 

“I’m sure it’s not,” Raab told him. 
“There are three groups based here, 
obviously. WeU — we can take Aose 
fixed launchers easily enough. But 
then we’d have to get to one of die 
ships fast, and get hand-bows. If we 
could get most of them bottled up 
in the buildings . We’ll have to 
get the prisoners loose and armed 
within a matter of minutes.” 
Willie Wainer said, “It doesn’t 
look like a very good chance. Skip- 
per.” 

“No,” Raab told him grimly, “but 
it’s the best one we’ll have. When 
that group we hit gets back with the 



word, there’ll be no more cardc»- 
ness.” 

Ben put in suddenly, “Do yoo 
trust me at all . sir?” 

Raab turned his head to face him. 
“How much would you trust me, if 
the situation were reversed?” 

Ben flushed but said doggedly, 
“I’d like to try for the ship. You*fl 
have five launchers aimed at my 
back. If I can get to the ship — tlM 
one closest to the buildings — and 
get its launchers manned, we can 
pin them down in the buildings fw 
a few minutes. Maybe hand bows 
will be better. Anyway — ” 

Raab said, annoyed, “That’s go- 
ing to be a desperate try. You migid 
look like a pin-cushion before ymi 
got halfway there.” 

Ben’s eyes turned to the ground. 
“I . Raab, I was wrong about 
your father. I was wrong to question 
your command. I’d like to make it 
up, if I could. If I try anydiing or 
yellow out, you can — can ^K>ot me 
in the back.” 

Watching his face, Raab couldn’t 
feel angry. “All right,” he said, 
“You’ve got the job. You’ll only 
have about five men. But we’ll re- 
inforce you as soon as we can.” 
All the rest of the afternoon, he 
worried. He’d made another hasty 
decision, and he wasn’t at all confi- 
dent it would turn out right 

XIV 

H alf-altern Ben Sprake, Jr., lay 
on mouldy leaves, with low- 
hanging jungle branches jabbing at 
the back of his neck. He could hear 
the murmur of small talk from (Hie

IF 




ot the Mederlink launcher emplace- 
ments, and smell cigarette smoke. 
From farther away, in the clearing, 
came occasional raised voices of a 
few mechanics still working. Lan- 
terns had already been lit. A few 
gleams came through the foliage. 

He squirmed into a slightly less 
uncomfortable position, then lay 
wondering if something had gone 
wrong with the plan. 

There were rustlings all about 
him, but he couldn’t tell whether 
those were small jungle animals or 
Raab’s men creeping into place. It 
seemed to him a long time had 
passed. He worried about the ani- 
mals, too, though there weren’t 
supposed to be any dangerous ones 
here. 

This would be his first combat, 
and it didn’t feel good. He hoped he 
wouldn’t get sick; it was hard 
enough to fight the fear and the 
weakness of his limbs and the tight- 
ness of his chest muscles that made 
it so hard to breath. He hoped very 
fervently that Raab had called things 
off, and wondered how long he’d 
have to lie here before he dared 
assume that. 

The sounds from the clearing 
were fewer now, and the lanterns 
seemed to be moving away. There 
was only the very dim hooded light 
from the emplacement. 

He wondered if Raab would 
bother to tell him if things had been 
called off. Raab probably hated him 
now. Raab would hate him if he 
knew everything. If he hadn’t be- 
lieved Reger’s vague hint that Raab 
was planning something strange, and 
left his own responsibility to go 



after Raab and spy, Oleeny would 
probably still be alive and Gaffer 
would be flying on the way home. 
And of course, afterward, when he 
suspected Reger, he should have 
spoken up; but he’d have had to 
admit his own dereliction of duty. 
And he hadn’t been sure. 

He’d been a fool, the way he’d 
let Reger lead him on with innocent- 
sounding little remarks. But then, 
Raab ought not to have humiliated 
him the way he did. That wasn’t 
the way one officer was supposed 
to treat another, especially in front 
of the men . even though he, 
Ben, had been wrong about some 
things. 

Well, it was too late now. All he 
could do was make sure he didn’t 
turn coward this time. He’d lived 
with his own cowardice all his life, 
and that hadn’t felt good either. In 
fist fights or knife fights or games 
where he might get hurt, he’d al- 
ways been a coward. He’d vowed so 
many times to change. But the 
trouble was, things happened so 
suddenly you didn’t have a chance 
to set yourself. 

It must have been hours he’d been 
lying here. He pondered unhappily 
whether he should start crawling 
away, and delayed that, more from 
indecision than anything else. 

T hen bows twanged, and men 
shouted or screamed in pain 
and surprise. The whole jungle 
seemed to erupt. 

He told himself desperately. I’ve 
got to move; yellowing out now 
would be worse than dying, worse 
than having a knife or arrow pierce

my flesh. With a terrible effort he 
forced his unwilling muscles into 
motion, and once he started, they 
seemed to move of their own will. 
The physical exertion actually made 
him feel a little better. He plunged 
through the foliage, skirted the em- 
placement where three of the crew 
stood staring down at two Link 
bodies. He turned his eyes from the 
blood, and <a*icd out, “Come on!” in 
a voice that shamed him by being 
shaky and too high. He ran toward 
the blimp nearest the buildings. 

The shouting around the emplace- 
ments had ended now, but all over 
the clearing and in the buildings 
other men were shouting. Arrows 
and harpoons flashed toward the 
few mechanics and guards still out- 
side. They ran for the buildings, and 
one or two of them went down, 
screaming. Someone was shouting, 
“The Armory! To the Armory!” 
Ben saw him; a Link Skipper who’d 
come out of the hangar. Arrows 
converged on the man, but he was 
already running and got to the 
Armory door without being hit. 
There were six men following Ben 
now, and it began to look as if 
they’d reach the ship safely. But ar- 
rows began to come from the arm- 
ory, and Ben’s fear suddenly be- 
came the familiar sharp, paralyzing 
thing. Still his legs kept pumping, 
somehow. He heard a cry tossed a 
glance behind him and saw Willie 
Wainer go tumbling. It was too dark 
to see where he was hit. He brushed 
off the notion of stopping to help, 
and forced himself on. He was gasp- 
ing for breath now, and so exhaust- 
ed he could hardly move. 



T hen he was at the ship, and he 
slammed awkwardly into the 
basket, half stunning himself. 

He clung fm* a moment, then 
gathered all his strength and pulled 
himself over the nul. The hand- 
bows first, he thou^t; they’re much 
faster. Others were tumbling in af- 
ter him. He fumbled for the weap- 
ons, nocked an arrow and sent it 
toward a window of the Armory. 
Harpoons were slamming into the 
building now. The Links got the 
wooden shields in place at the big 
windows, and there were only the 
narrow slits to shoot at. That 
worked both ways; the men inside 
couldn’t aim very well through the 
slits. But arrows did come, and he 
flinched every time one came near 
him. He was shooting as fast as he 
could now. The physical effort 
seemed to drive the fear away a 
little. 

Raab and several others burst in- 
to sight, running for the stockade. 
The men in the Armory couldn’t 
concentrate much in that direction, 
but someone in a Barracks had a 
bow and an easy range. Ben cried 
out, “Aim at /i/m!” He dropped the 
bow and groped for the lashings of 
a launcher, got it loose and fumbled 
for a harpoon while he cranked with 
one hand. 

He sent the missile at the door of 
the Barracks, which was open a 
crack, and slammed it wide open. 
Other harpoons, from the emplace- 
ments, streaked that way and the 
men inside stopped shooting. A mo- 
ment later someone shoved the door 
shut and Ben heard a bolt thud in- 
to place. But one of Raab’s small

IF 




group was down and another was 
limping badly. 

They reached the stockade and 
worked frantically at the gate. It 
came open and men spilled out, 
yelling. The rest of Gaffer’s crew — 
plus Nik Roos’s men, but excepting 
those still manning the emplace- 
ments — were at the ships now, grab- 
bing hand-bows and cranking 
launchers. 

It was because Ben was so busy 
watching for counter-attacks, and 
because, of the dusk, that he didn’t 
see the harpoon coming from the 
Armory until it was almost upon 
him. 

He stared at it in fascination, 
realizing in a flash that he wouldn’t 
have time to dodge. Instinctively, 
though, he was moving, and got 
turned to the side so that it didn’t 
hit him from the front and kill him 
instantly. Even as it pierced his 
body, missing the spine, and 
slammed him hard against the other 
side of the basket, his mind rejected 
the fact. But he was lying there, 
hardly able to squirm, and he could 
feel his own blood flowing hot un- 
der his uniform. 

Wonder seized him that it didn’t 
hurt more. There was a great pain 
somewhere, but it was as if it were 
walled away from him somehow, 
so that he only got a faint spill-over. 
The smell of blood was worse. His 
mouth was open and he was afraid 
he was going to scream, but what 
came out, feebly, was “Raab . 

He clamped his lipft on a whimper, 
beginning to feel the pain now, and 
the fright, and thinking that he 
wouldn’t even know if they won. 



Then there were men swarming 
around, grabbing bows, and Raab’s 
voice said, as if from a distance, 
“Fire arrows! Make some fire ar- 
rows!” Then someone mentioned his 
own name, also from a great dis- 
tance, and then Raab was bending 
over him. He took a breath to 
speak, clenched his teeth in agony 
at the motion of his lungs, managed 
to whisper, “Are we — ?” 

Raab bent close. “They’re all 
bottled up. We’ll let them surrender 
a few at a time, and have them all 
tied up before they realize how few 
of us there are.” He seemed to be 
speaking as clearly as he could, and 
in detail, as if he understood Ben’s 
anxiety. 

Now Ben could feel death creep- 
ing over him, and he was afraid, but 
above that, he was proud. And he 
knew Raab wouldn’t leave him. 

XV 

L ess than seven weeks after the 
departure from Lowry, Raab 
stood at the forward rail of a Med- 
erlink fighting blimp, staring ahead 
and down at the lights of the mesa. 

It was pre-dawn. The moons had 
set. He could have been here two 
or three days earlier, but he’d 
chosen to stay with the other cap- 
tured fighters, escorting four Hens 
which were loaded down with glid- 
ers, guano, food and weapons. But 
they’d easily evaded what was left 
of the blockade, and there hadn’t 
been any trouble from the Links 
pressed into service as paddlers (and 
tied to their seats). Now he’d pulled 
ahead to persuade the ground de- 



PRISONERS OF THE SKY 




fenses, before they cut loose with 
harpoons, that this wasn’t the en- 
emy. They’d seen him against the 
stars, of course; they would be wait- 
ing for him to come within range. 

The movable steering vanes made 
navigating a lot easier than with 
poor old Gaffer, the remains of 
which he’d gathered up and brought 
home. He ordered, “Constrict a 
quarter-turn forward.’’ He still for- 
got, sometimes, that it was Nik Roos 
beside him instead of Ammet 
Oleeny. He hadn’t put anyone in 
Ben’s place, aft. 

This ship’s pinger was a good 
loud one. He struck it twice, paused, 
sh-uck it twice again with the little 
mallet. No reply. He sent the signal 
for ‘Parley’ again, then gave up. 
They’d soon be in flute range. 

Finally he got a reply to a flute 
message. “Ship aloft; say again. 
Message not clear.” 

He sighed, and fluted again. 
"Gaffer II asking permission to 
land. Skipper Raab Garan, com- 
manding.” 

There was a long wait, then, 
“Come in slowly. No tricks.” 

He turned his head aft. “Paddles, 
quarter-speed.” He let his hands 
rest on the levers that controlled the 
vanes. “Nik, will you strike a lan- 
tern so they can recognize me?” 
Unless, he thought, he looked as 
much older and different as he felt. 

They were slanting nicely toward 
the tie-down spot outlined in lan- 
terns. He could see individual faces 
now; ground handlers waiting to 
seize dangling ropes, bowmen with 
weapons ready. “Stop paddles.” 
They settled close. He tugged at lev- 

48 



ers to raise the nose a little. They 
bumped gently. 

A middle-aged man in a Skipper’s 
uniform came from the shad- 
ows to peer. “By God! It is Raab 
Garan!” His face hardened. “What 
the devil?” 

Raab put down a smoulder of 
anger. “A captured ship, sir.” The 
other’s longer time-in-rank made 
him Raab’s senior. “There are more 
coming. I’d like a signal-fire to call 
them in.” 

The senior Skipper, whose name 
was Linder, looked bewildered and 
undecided. “Garan, under the cir- 
cumstances you can’t blame me for 
taking precautions.” 

Now a little anger did spill from 
Raab. “Linder, it doesn’t matter 
who blames who. Do you recognize 
this man beside me?” 

Linder peered, and ejaculated, 
“Nik Roos! I thought he was dead!” 
“So did a lot of people,” Raab 
told him impatiently. “But he’s alive, 
and he knows who the real traitors 
were. There are two of them on — ” 
He stopped, realizing how many men 
were listening. “Can you bring the 
rest of my ships in? The crews have 
been through a lot. And I’d like to 
get to Admiral Kline as soon as I 
can. Sir.” 

Linder’s face turned dejected. “If 
you’d only gotten here sooner. The 
Admiral’s under house arrest, and 
under heavy guard. I think — Raab, 
it looks like surrender.” 

“Surrender?" Raab fairly shouted. 
“Why — ” He forced himself to 
speak quietly. “Sir, with what I’ve 
got — and what the Links have lost — 

IF 




we can wipe out the blockade! For 
months, maybe. TheyTl have to 
send out a whole new fleet!” 

Linder gestured hopelessly. “Ev«i 
if that’s true — and you have to 
admit it sounds fantastic — it’s too 
late. The staff has decided to sur- 
render to Mederlink.” 

“The Staff!” The words burst 
from Raab savagely. “Why, Linder 
— excuse me, Skipper.” He beck- 
oned the man close and spoke in a 
very low voice. “I’ve got ships, glid- 
ers, plenty of helium. What men I 
have, except for prisoners, will face 
up to whatever has to be done. They 
won’t let a group of weaklings, 
moved by traitors, order them into 
surrender. How many men do you 
have who’ll follow you?” 

Linder looked shocked, then 
amazed. He swept his eyes over 
Raab’s crew; then spun back to 
Raab, eyes blazing. “Yes! Free the 
Admiral first thing; get some legal- 
ity behind us! I’d better send mes- 
sages, and make sure — ” He started 
away at a run, halted suddenly. 
“Oh!” He gestured to an Altern. 
“You, there. Help Skipper Garan 
with a signal fire, and have hot 
food and baths for those crews,

His voice trailed away as he left, 
heading for the headquarters build- 
ing. 

Heart pounding, Raab climbed 
out of the basket and started away 
with the Altern. 

From the blimp’s basket came 
Cudebek’s chuckle. “It looks as if

ceed his orders — again.” END

IF • Short Story 



BUILD WE MUST 

by DANNIE PLACHTA 

We wenf fo visit the Martians — 
but they greeted us at the doorl 



W hen I was still very young — 
ah<i still very foolish, I must 
admit — I happened to encounter a 
particularly intriguing theory regard- 
ing the Martian moons. Some Soviet 
astronomer had reasoned that the 
twin moons of Mars were actually 
gigantic artificial satellites. You may 
recall the details; I won’t go that 
far into it. But the speculations 
sounded so damned possible. 

In any event, it really fired my 
imagination. Artificial satellites ten 
miles in diameter . artifacts of a 
vastly superior civilization . The 
romantic fool in me demanded some 
concrete action in a matter of such 
obvious importance. It must have 
been then that I caught the bug. So 
I went through the whole bit and 
became an astronaut. 

B efore I’d completed my training, 
most of our non-military space 
operations had been placed under 
international control. There’d been 
a few spectacular and even tragic 
failures by both sides in the space 
race, and 1 guess that enough level 



heads prevailed to allow all of us 
the advantages of pooled resources. 
Anyway, when our U.N. -sponsored 
flight left as the first manned Mars 
probe, we were one happy family. 

I won’t bother running through 
our flight roster. You read the pap- 
ers; you watch TV; you know things 
about us we’ve forgotten. What is 
important is that a hundred thousand 
miles Earthside of Mars, we were 
met by one of their spaceships. 

They eased the shock by radioing 
ahead (yes, their English was quite 
perfect) of their wish to meet us. 
One of our people was to meet their 
representative between, and outside 
of, our respective ships. This was the 
best technique because of our en- 
vironmental differences. Since I was 
the least willing, I was the man se- 
lected to suit-up and rendezvous with 
the Martian. 

I won’t attempt to describe him 
as he appeared to me in his space 
suit. About all I saw of him was his 
space suit, and that looked pretty 
much like mine. He propelled him- 
self over from his own craft very 



50 



easily, and I struggled out to him as 
well as I could. We floated alongside 
each other at a distance of a few 
feet — him free and in complete 
control of his movements, me twist- 
ing at the end of my umbilical line. 
I felt a little foolish. 

The alien spoke through my head- 
set. “We have been putting off any 
actual contact with your race,” he 
said. 

“Any special reason?” I asked 
him. 

“We are a peaceful race,” he re- 
plied. 

I guess I understood but didn’t 
say anything. About that time I 
tumbled over, and with an easy 
motion he righted me. 

“But we know nothing of you,” 
I reminded the Martian. “Have 
you — has your race — been hero 
long?” 

“Approximately five hundred 
thousand Earth-years,” he answered. 

I didn’t say anything. The alien 
went on. 

“Our race is from another solar 



system. We colonized this immediate 
area.” 

L ike an utter idiot, I tumbled 
again, and once more he 
straightened me up. 

He continued: “The point where 
we settled was tihe optimum position 
for the physical requirements of our 
race — just the proper distance from 
your star — an ideal location. 

“But we were forced to make 
some changes. Tliere wasn’t suffi- 
cient living space. Tlien too, the 
planetary environment fi^ed to meet 
our needs. So we set oat to do that 
which was necessary. Forhmately 
for our race, we succeeded.” 

I suddenly remembered the old 
pet theory. “Then you build the 
moons! You had to expand, and 
alter the environment, so you con- 
structed the twin satellites!” 

“Oh, the moons were here when 
we arrived, thou^ in entirdy dif- 
ferent orbits. We did, howevw, have 
to build the object you call Mars.”

THE 

KETTLE BLACK 

by STEVE BUCHANAN 



niustrated by NOOEL 



Tfiree Eorfhmen battled a whole 
planet. Clearly the odds were 
enormous — against the aliens! 



I 

S tade had been a month dying 
before he sent for Witten. 

During that month he managed 
to settle his affairs — not that there 
was really much to do. An xenolo- 
gist doesn’t accumulate a great deal 
of money, and any man who travels 
among the stars finds his friends 
dead or aged past recognition when 



he — still young — returns. During 
the last week Stade lay in his room 
and often reviewed his life. 

Happily he found he had few 
regrets — except for Witten. 

As Stade waited for Witten to 
arrive, he flipped through the 
yellowed pages of the book, which 
was expensive and very old. He 
closed the book and placed it on 
a bedside table, still unsure just how 



52 






THE KETTLE BLACK

much to teD Witten. Perhaps he 
should just present the antique as 
a gift; Witten would eventually read 
it. He’s still young, Stade thought. 
It was only a year ago that we 
returned from HD 27421 IV. 

T he survey ship had been deceler- 
ating for over six months and 
approached the star designated as 
27421 in the ancient and much re- 
vised Henry Draper catalogue with 
a speed of only a few hundreds of 
miles a second. 

Since the primary purpose of the 
survey was to find planets suitable 
for colonization, the ship flashed past 
the frozen outer planets content with 
radiation analyses. While still near- 
ly half a billion miles from the star 
itself, the instruments on the ship 
monitored artificial long-wave radio 
signals originating on the fourth 
planet. 

Stade sat in a cubicle just , off 
the control room composing tapes 
while Witten, a dark youngster with 
the powerful musculature peculiar 
to the inhabitants of high gravity 
planets, programmed a landing se- 
quence into a computer. Both men 
took pleasure in their work. Stade, 
because at last he had access to 
an alien culture in its unsullied 
native state. Witten, because every 
task connected with his first ex- 
ploration mission was, at the very 
least, interesting. 

Witten read the information the 
computer typed on a sheet of paper 
and then walked over to Stade. “We 
blast in about five minutes. You’d 
better get strapped in.” 

Stade nodded. “All right, I’ll be 



there in a minute.” He carefidly 
marked his place and walked over to 
an acceleration couch. “How many 
G’sr 

“Up to ten.” Witten answered. 
Stade winced and buckled himsdf 
into the webbing. 

A few minutes later the ship 
shuddered as the drive increase 
from one gravity of acceleration 
to two. Witten spread his feet i 
little wider apart as his weight in- 
creased to nearly a quarter of a 
ton. 

The crew’s third and final mem- 
ber, William Skinner, stepped into 
the room. He was a huge man who 
radiated an aura of strength and 
alertness. 

Skinner was a mech — more ma- 
chine than man. Encased in steel 
and plastic, only his brain and 
spinal cord were left of his original 
body, which had been irreparably 
damaged years ago. “Is everything 
ready?” Skinner asked. 

“Yes. We go up to four G’s in 
about two minutes.” Stade groaned 
and Witten grinned at him. 

Four hours later they were de- 
celerating again at one gravity 
along a course which would bring 
them within orbiting distance of 
the fourth planet. 

When they were only a few mil- 
lion miles away, they used the ship’s 
transmitters to send a recording of 
some of the signals they had picked 
up. They followed this recording 
with a rendition of the numbers 
from one to ten in both the con- 
ventional and binary systems, a few 
simple addition and subtraction 
problems in both systems, and ended 



54 



IF 




with Stade reading the first two 
pages of the ship’s Offhud Cook- 
book. They recorded the whole pro- 
gram and rebroadcast it at houxly 
intervals. 

A few hours after they had Hast- 
ed again and established an 
orbit some eighteen thousand miles 
above the planet’s surface where the 
ship could maintain a stationary 
position in reference to the plan- 
et’s surface, Stade was able to an- 
nounce that contact had definitely 
been made. 

Witten had been idly turning from 
one station to another, recording 
choice bits of what might have been 
the local equivalent of music, speech, 
or something entirely different for 
Stade’s ethnographic opus, when 
Stade took off his earphones, tossed 
them on the table top and stood up 
from the console where he had been 
alternately monitoring the ship’s 
transmission and recording the re- 
ceptions between the transmission 
in search of a reply. 

“Well, gentlemen, we’re in,” he 
said. “They replayed our signal and 
then followed it on the same band 
with some stuff of their own. All 
the stations on adjacent frequencies 
have dropped off the air. I’ve start- 
ed the contact computer on its 
cycle. It’s handling all their sig- 
nals and progressing through those 
first mathematical symbols to learn- 
ing their language.” 

“How long?” Skinner asked. 

“We ought to be able to get to 
the point where it can absorb data 
from their ordinary radio programs 
in three or four days if they work 



with at night on at least two cluui- 
nels. Afttf that, say thirty or fortf 
hours to be able to communicate 
with them fluently.** 

Skinner grinned and said, ‘^Ah, 
the wondo^ of cultund anthropolo- 
gy, not to mention eybemetics. I 
guess when and where we land is 
next. Ar^ suggestions?** 

Stade answered, *Td prefer to 
land now. If we land near where 
they Mem to have estabfi^ed their 
communication center, well be able 
to accomplish more. The distance 
makes it hard on thnn; they’re 
probably throwing every kilowatt 
they have at us now.** 

“Is there any sign of a division 
of the planet into nations?” Witten 
asked. *T wouldn’t like to be A- 
bombed because one country thinks 
we’re giving military secrets to an- 
other.” 

Skinner said, “Well, for one thing, 
there aren’t any indications of any 
kind of an atomics industry or of 
space travel either, for that mat- 
ter. I’d say that in thirty or forty 
years they’ll have both. The sen- 
sor’s haven’t picked up any radia- 
tion. I’m for landing now, too. 
There are two main continents, one 
of which is mostly desert and ap- 
parently is almost uninhabited. The 
other looks like a political unity. 
At least, there aren’t any arm^ 
frontiers or outposts. 

“Where are we gmng to put 
her down?” 

“Right next to their second lar^ 
est city. It’s the source of the sig- 
nals we’ve been receiving. I’ve 
picked out what looks like a good 
spot — here.” 



THE KEHLE BLACK 



55 




Stade made some adjustments on 
a console and successive pictures 
flashed on the big screen. Finally 
he found the one he wanted and 
pointed out the spot he had picked. 
It was a broad plain about thirty 
miles from the dty. 

Witten went back to playing with 
the radio while Stade and Skinner 
compared the infra-red scannings 
with the visual picture. Finally they 
agreed to land as soon as Stade 
got his equipment in order. 

II 

I n a little over two hours the ship 
dropped down onto the plain. 
They had taken the last leg of 
their approach slow and easy, and 
before they were far into the at- 
mosphere a group of airplanes were 
swarming around below them. 

Skinner mumbled something about 
ramming one of the planes that 
buzzed them. Stade reported that 
they were being scanned by radar. 
After the ship came to rest, the 
men stayed in their seats for a 
moment. Witten looked at the 
screen and watched the clouds of 
dust settle outside the ship. Once 
a plane shot past overhead. An- 
other plane passed across the screen 
only fifty or so feet above the 
ship’s nose. 

“Damn it,” Skinner said as he 
reached forward and made an ad- 
justment on the board in front of 
him. “Another twenty feet and he’d 
have hit the defensive screen and 
been burned. I’m going to set the 
discriminator to burn anything that 
flies within fifty yards that is under 



half the size of their smallest plane." 

“Do you really think that’s neces- 
sary? I mean setting up the screen 
at all?” Stade asked mildly. “We 
could spot the concentration of any 
offensive force in advance and turn 
cm the screen then.” He went on 
more strongly, “I’d hate to start 
something and ruin our chances 
of completing our work through an 
accident.” 

“Yeah,” Skinner answered. “I 
can see us spotting one of those 
planes launching a missile and get- 
ting the screen up before it gets 
here. Sorry, but you’ve got no 
precedence. Check the regulations.” 

Witten had walked to the screen 
and had been studying it while the 
other two argued. He saw some- 
thing and increased the magnifica- 
tion. “I think I see a possible con- 
centration of — uh — offensive 
force. In advance, even.” 

Skinner checked the screen and 
the radar. He whistled, “Yes, an 
armored convoy of about twenty 
vehicles leaving from the city, and 
about eight or ten big choppers 
right above them.” 

The three of them watched the 
screen for awhile and then finally 
cut the picture back to normal 
magnification. The cloud of dust 
which marked the progress of the 
convoy was still visible. 

Stade said, “Well, that’s to be 
expected. They’ll probably put 
enough armor around us to wage 
a war.” He glanced at Skinner 
and then continued, “We can set 
the discriminator not to burn any- 
thing on the ground travelling under 
a certain speed.” 



56 



IF 




The convoy deployed in a circle 
about a hundred yards in diameter 
with the ship at its center. Some of 
the vehicles ran on treads and ob- 
viously utilized some sort of internal 
combustion engine for power. There 
were also smaller, swifter vehicles 
which ran on wheels. The men 
kept to the ship and followed de- 
velopments through closed-circuit 
television and radar and infra-red 
scanners. 

About an hour after the first con- 
voy arrived, a second, larger group 
pulled in. They too deployed in a 
circle around the ship. In the con- 
trol room Skinner and Witten 
watched the tanks rumble into 
position. Stade was below checking 
his precious computer. They drank 
coffee and watched as they were 
watched in turn. 

T he next two days passed with- 
out incident. 

The natives did not approach 
closer than about fifty yards. They 
threw up some prefabricated build- 
ings outside the circle of tanks and 
artillary. A shipment of what 
looked like scientific equipment 
arrived and was assembled. Skinner 
grumbled about ray guns and disin- 
tegrators. The men took numerous 
photographs of the inhabitants and 
occasion^y ventured outside the 
ship in a suit to let the natives have 
a look at them. 

The planet’s owners turned out 
to be about seven feet tall, rather 
thin, and at least superficially 
humanoid. Their skin was a ma- 
hogany brown. They had binocular 
vision, but their oblong skulls 



seemed devoid of hair, ears, nose, 
(X anything resembling a mouth, 
^^fitten mused over the problem of 
how tiiey ate but was unable to 
come up with any answer. The men 
never strayed more than a few 
ywds from the ship, and the natives 
made no attempt to approach. 
Skinner surmised that they had 
probably detected the radar sensor 
screen around the ship and perhaps 
had deduced something of its pur- 
pose. 

“Anyway, they probably figure 
the next move is up to us,” he said. 

Finally Stade came up to the 
control room with a sheet of what 
looked like teletype paper. “It’s fin- 
ished,” he announced. “TTie machine 
will keep improving, inCTeasing its 
vocabularly and correcting itself, 
but these are just refinements. I 
just sent them a message saying 
that we are a scientific expedition, 
wished them long lives and good 
luck, and told them we’d only be 
here for a short time. We struck 
a bargain: they answer my ques- 
tions, and I answer theirs.” 

“No doubt they want to know 
how to build a spaceship and how 
to live forever?” Skinner asked. 

“Not exactly. Their first ques- 
tions were aboitf our equipment. 
The computer stffl doesn’t have the 
scientific vocabulary it needs, bin 
the way they’re sbovdiDg inforni- 
tion in, it’s only a nutter of a day 
or so before it wffl be aWe to an- 
swer most of what they want to 
know. They’ve divided themselves 
into two groups, one group to frame 
their questions and the <^her to 
answer mine. Tm uimg past of the

computer as a translator and feed- 
ing their questions to the ship’s 
computer.” 

‘‘And you’re giving them the in- 
formation to build a fusion con- 
verter, right? Or have you gotten 
around to that yetT’ Skinner asked. 

“That is one of the questions 
on their list. We don’t have the 
vocabularly yet, but we will.” He 
paused and looked at Skinner for 
a moment before he continued. 
“Yes, I’ll give them the equations 
and a description of the condi- 
tional requirement. That’s all I can 
do since I don’t know their tech- 
nology. Look, Skinner, what dif- 
ference does it make? Even with 
the information, it will take them 
at least five or ten years to develop 
the techniques they’ll need to 
build anything. Besides, they’ll have 
it themselves in a century or so.” 
His voice took on a pleading note 
as he went on. “Please, Skinner. 
I’m asking for your help. Fve even 
got a release from administration 
that covers everything. Okay?” 

S kinner was silent. Finally he 
nodded. 

Stade said, “Witten, you can keep 
an eye on the computer. It’s al- 
ready programmed for the next thir- 
ty hours. I’ll be back before then. 
They’ve asked me to visit the city 
for some kind of ceremony. I ought 
to . .” 

“No.” Skinner cut him off. “For- 
get it. You’re not going.” 

Stade seemed amazed. “Now 
wait a minute. Why shouldn’t I 

gor 

“Do I have to explain it to you? 



We can’t trust them. Who knows 
what they’re up to? Beg off some- 
how.” 

Stade was getting angry. “You 
just can’t tell me what I can and 
can’t do. There’s nothing to cover 
this in the book. I can call a vote, 
and I’m doing it.” He looked over 
at Witten. “WeU?” 

Witten was caught off guard. He 
looked from one to the other and 
hesitated. 

Stade said, “Phil, if I don’t go, 
besides missing film of the city, 
we may insult them or really mess 
things up. I gather this is quite 
an important ceremony. Please?” 
Witten looked at Sldnner, who 
said nothing. Witten said slowly, 
“Well, if it’s important, I vote yes.” 
For a long moment no one said 
anything. Then Stade broke the 
silence. “It’s settled then. No doubt 
you’ll want this vote recorded, 
Skinner. Witten, if you’ll . .” 

“It’s not quite settled,” Skinner 
said in a low voice. “There’s just 
one thing; I’m going, not you.” 
“Why?” 

“For a lot of reasons. I’m more 
experienced for one thing. You 
know I’ve been on contact missions 
before.” 

Stade traded looks with Witten, 
who only shrugged. “Okay, Skin- 
ner, but you’ve got to promise to 
take it easy. I don’t think you’d do 
anything on purpose, but if some- 
thing goes wrong, and I think it 
was your fault, I’ll see that you’re 
finished. I want you to wear a re- 
corder.” 

Skinner smiled and said, “You 
forget just one thing. If something 



M 



IF 




happens, I probi^ly won’t be com- 
ing back.” 

Stade looked at him for a second 
and then grinned. “Right” He 
looked at his wsdeh. “You’d bet- 
ter get moving. Ymi’re due over at 
tbedr shack in about forty-five min- 
utes. I’ll rig up a field relay imit 
for you so you can stay linked to 
the ship no matter where you are.” 

Witten followed Skinner below 
to help him suit up. 

Despite the light gravity, whidi 
was only alK}ut two-thirds earth 
normal, Skinner chose an armored 
suit with a jump attachment. Witten 
guessed that die suit and its cm- 
tents, even on this planet, must 
weigh a thousand pounds or mmre. 
Skinner moved easUy in the suit 
even though the power attachments 
hadn’t been activated. He clanked 
into the armory and looked over the 
racks of mobile weapons. Witten 
followed him. After some delibera- 
tion Skinner selected a heavy laser 
beamer and had Witten strg^ the 
power pack to his back, 

Stade stepped into the room and 
frowned at his heavily armed ship- 
mate, but smd nothing. Skinner 
dung a belt of fusion grenades over 
his shoulder and went into the 
other compartments to get his hel- 
met. Stade looked at Witten and said 
peevishly, “Good God! You’d think 
he was going to start a war. If he 
thinks he’s going to pull some- 
thing funny, he’d better think 
again.” 

‘Take it easy,” Witten answered. 
“I don’t blame him. If I were go- 
ing wandering around on an un- 
explored planet. I’d take a cee- 



bomb or two. Relax, he’s playing it 
straight.” 

They followed Skinner to the 
airlock. Stade handed him a plastic- 
encased gadget on a duml^r strap 
“Here’s the relay. Hi be in touch 
with you every minute.” He stuck 
out his hand. 

Skinner hdd up an armored fist 
and said, “You don’t want to shake 
this.” He pulled on the hdmet and 
Witten fastened its seal. 

A few minutes later they watched 
the huge figure stride towards the 
line of squat vehicles. His steps 
raised small puffs of dust. 

T 'me dra^d for the men in the 
ship. Skinner didn’t seem in- 
clined to make any comments, and 
apparently the natives communicated 
their instructions to him by ges- 
ture and example rather than by the 
medium of the compute-. Witten and 
Stade sat in the computer room 
and watched the translator chatter 
out an occasional message from the 
natives. Stade read the cmnmunica- 
tions to Skinner, who either com- 
plied with the request or, if an 
answer was required, gave his re- 
ply to Stade, who sent the answer 
back via the translator. The system 
was rather cumbersome, but it was 
effective. After about forty-five min- 
utes Skinner announced that he had 
reached the city. A few moments 
later the suit monitor lights winked 
out. 

Stade turned with a puzzled frown 
on his face and said to Witten, 
“He probably went into a building 
with a metal frame. The suit mon- 
itor works on regular F.M. I didn’t 



THE KETTLE BLACK 



59 




rig up a circuit for it on the field 
unit.” Nevertheless he flicked a 
button and spoke into the micro- 
phone. “Skinner, arc you still with 
us?** 

“Sure,” the radio crackled. “We 
just walked into a really big build- 
ing. Right now I*m in a large hall. 
Looks like a church. This must be 
the place. There are a lot of pom- 
pous looking bastards standing 
around. Don’t worry. I’ll let you 
know if I get shot or anything.” 

“Fine. We were just wondering.” 
Stade put the mike back on the 
table and turned to Witten. “I knew 
there wouldn’t be any trouble. Now 
I wish I’d held out and gone my- 
self.” 

Witten said, “The recorder will 
pick up everything. They’re probably 
giving him the keys to the city 
now.” 

Ill 

I n the city Skinner walked through 
a long hall, glancing upwards 
occasionally to the vaulted ceiling 
high above. He was enjoying him- 
self. His guide led him to a highly 
decorated pavilion-like structure un- 
der which a table sat. Around it 
stood six or seven natives; they were 
dressed ornately with glittering 
robes and metal bands around their 
oddly jointed fingers, Skinner was 
on the point of saying something 
to the men in the ship when sud- 
denly one of the members of his 
escort raised a hand gun and fired 
directly at him. 

For an instant Skinner was 
stunned, then he whirled and caught 



the native a back-handed blow with 
his armored hand. Skinner looked 
down at his side where the gun had 
been aimed. The front of the field 
unit was smashed. 

Skinner shook off his surprise and 
looked around; the whole scene 
seemed in stow motion. There were 
armed greenies everywhere. He an- 
ticipated a rush, and was surprised 
when it didn’t come. He swung his 
head from side to side; he was 
missing something, and he knew 
it. 

Skinner sensed a movement above 
him and looked up just in time 
to see a heavy metal net fall to- 
wards him. 

The net dropped over him and 
its weight pressed down. He en- 
gaged the suit’s gyro and power 
equipment and managed to keep 
his feet. The natives at the edges 
of the net hurried to fasten it to 
the floor. Skinner flicked his right 
arm and the laser projector flashed 
into his hand from its sheath on his 
forearm like an opening switch 
blade. 

Skinner stood upright and watched 
them fasten the net to cleats in 
the floor. Easy does it, he re- 
minded himself. Obviously they 
want me alive. Skinner laced the 
fingers of his left hand through 
the links of the net and pulled. He 
strained, and as the net held he 
saw the power indicator on the 
tiny panel in the helmet climb into 
the overload zone. Then the net 
parted with a sound like the mesh- 
ing of gears. 

Instantly he was hit by a hail 
of bullets from his tormentors. The

61 




projectiles bounced off his armor 
and whined into the crowd. Buffeted 
by the concussiwis, he staggered 
through the rent in the net. The 
tiify hot eye of the laser winked 
wiate. 

t4T ook, the carrier beam from 

-L/the field unit just stopped,** 
Stade said. 

“What?** 

“Skinner isn*t transmitting any- 
more. Wait a minute. Maybe it*s 
our receiver.” Stade checked the 
instrument board and then said, “No. 
we’re receiving. He just isn’t trans- 
mitting.” 

“Try calling him,” Witten said. 
Stade tried, but there was no re- 
sponse. 

The translator began to click 
as a message was typed out. Stade 
said, “Maybe this will tell us what’s 
going on.” He waited until the 
machine quit clicking and then tore 
off the sheet. “There. I thought it 
might be something like this. They 
say the field unit was dropped and 
it seems to be broken. Skinner will 
complete the tour and will be back 
here in a few hours.” 

Witten didn’t say anything. The 
whole thing didn’t sound right. He 
frowned and tried to decide what 
he should do. 

If the greenies were telling the 
truth, he could make a fool of 
himself and mess up the whole 
mission by doing the wrong thing 
now. And yet, the communicator 
was a sturdy machine. He couldn’t 
imagine it being broken by being 
dropped. 

Stade chattered on peevishly, “I 



knew I should have gone myself. Ife 
can’t possibly get anything •©- 
complished without the translator. 
I guess I should have — ” He l»:oice 
off as Witten stood up. 

“I’m going into the city. Tefl 
them that I’m bringing him a re- 
placement unit and that either they 
can fly me in one of their chop- 
pers, or I can take the flitter.” 

“But I don’t even have a re- 
placement. I’ve got the components, 
but he’ll be back before I can 
assemble them.” 

“It doesn’t make any difference. 
I just want to check on him. Make 
me up a dummy unit. No. I’ll take 
one of the survey relays. It ought 
to have plenty of power. You can 
relay it into the translator.” Witten 
turned and headed for the suit 
room. 

Stade, talking excitedly, followed 
him. “Witten, now calm down. May- 
be you ought to take him a radio, 
but let’s talk this over. We ought 
to find out . .” 

Witten turned on him and said, 
“Shut up. I’m going. Now get on 
the translator and tell them what I 
said.” Stade shut up but followed 
him down to the suit room. The two 
walked down the corridor in a 
strained silence. 

A s Witten was suiting up, an 
alarm rang somewhere in the 
ship. Stade stepped to a wall mon- 
itor and dialed into the ship’s com- 
munications system. 

His face was white when he 
looked up from the screen. “The 
magnetic sensors just recorded three 
peaks that would correspond to the 



62 



IF 




effect of three fusion grenades be- 
ing exploded at a low yield. The 
seismograph got them too. I can’t 
triangulate, but they’re on a line 
which extends through the city. TTie 
magnitude is about right for there 
if they were fusion grenades." 

Witten continued adjusting the 
suit. “Get up there and tell them 
what I told you. I’m taking the 
flitter. Skinner already programmed 
the weapons system to blast all that 
junk guarding us if they fire, so 
don’t worry about the ship.” 

Stade scampered from the room 
without a word. Witten grabbed a 
rapid-fire rocket launcher and two 
belts of ammunition from the arm- 
ory, and an atomic torch and a 
radio from the survey equipment. 
He climbed up to where the flitter 
sat snut in its launching tube. As 
he was checking out the little plane’s 
instruments, the whole ship was 
buffeted with a series of shudders. 

Witten clicked on the radio and 
said, ‘*Hey! What’s going on?” 

A moment later Stade’s voice 
crackled in his ear. “They opened 
fire on us. The laser screen vapor- 
ized the first two shells. Skinner 
must have programmed the system 
to open fire on the third shell. The 
beams burned everything they set 
up and the tanks. The planes are 
down too. Are you about ready?” 

“I’m gone,” Witten said and de- 
pressed the launching lever. The lit- 
tle craft shot out from the m.other 
ship on ducted-fan air jets. 

Instantly it was picked up by the 
ship’s weapons system, but before 
the lasers released their blast of 
energy, a signal from a transmitter 



in the flitter identified it as a 
friend to the ship. Witten looked 
into the flitter’s viewing screen and 
smiled mirthlessly. 

Below him were piles of smokipg 
slag that had once been armon^ 
vehicles. When the flitter hit Mach 
I, he cut in the ram jets. The ship 
was still accelerating when he 
reached the outskirts of the city. 
Witten checked a direction finder 
and began to cut his speed as he 
flew in a wide circle just above 
the tallest of the city’s buildings. A 
red light flashed on the panel in 
front of him, and he looked into 
the screen just in time to see a 
plane explode somewhere above 
him. 

Compared to the sophisticated sys- 
tem of the starship, the flitter’s 
weapon’s weren’t much; but they 
were more than a match for the 
turbojet and prop competition they 
were up against. 

Witten completed the triangula- 
tion of the signals from Skinner’s 
suit monitor. He should have been 
close enough for voice contact 
through the suit radio, but he was 
unable to raise the other man. 

Witten flipped a switch and spoke 
to Stade. “This is Witten. I’m going 
to bail out right over the triangula- 
tion point. Take remote control of 
the flitter and make some diversion- 
ary attacks on the other side of the 
city. You might drop a low-yield 
bomb or two. Be careful and don’t 
fry us, though. I’ll call you when 
I need you, okay?” Stade agreed 
and Witten cut off the radio and 
opened the emergency exit to his 
right. He checked his radio, direc- 



THE KETTLE BLACK

rion finder, and weapons. Finally 
accdropped into space. 

W itten fell free until he was 
about three hundred feet 
above the surface, and then he cut 
in the suit’s jets and slowed his 
descent. 

Below him row on row of ten 
and twenty story buildings were 
crowded together. Witten dropped 
to the ground near one of these 
buildings and took a reading on the 
signal. That way. He started down 
■he narrow street in the long strides 
characteristic of power suit locomo- 
tion. Funny that there aren’t any 
oeople out, he thought. Once or 
twice he saw a few greenies scur- 
rying around corners at his ap- 
proach. 

He had just stopped to take an- 
other reading when a tremendous 
clang sounded in his ears and 
simultaneously something jarred the 
suit. 

Immediately he realized some sort 
of projectile had bounced off the 
suit’s armor. Witten whirled around 
and saw a group of four or five 
greenies taking aim at him from a 
distance of about fifty yards. Again 
the dang and jar. 

Witten raised the rocket launcher, 
thumbed the warhead setting to a 
minimal reading, and squeezed the 
trigger. An instant later there was 
a bright flash followed by a tre- 
mendous concussion. 

He trotted around the next cor- 
ner and knew he had found Skin- 
ner. Four tanks were pulled up in 
a semi-circle with their guns facing 
the entrance of a building. Fifty or 



a hundred greenies were hastily 
throwing up barricades. There were 
four or five semi-portable weapons 
of some kind covering another door 
on the adjacent side. 

Witten ducked back around the 
corner and considered his position. 
He became aware of a series of dull 
explosions somewhere in the dis- 
tance. Probably Stade and the flit- 
ter, he thought. Witten decided to 
enter the building through the door 
nearest him. If he could knock out 
the tanks and get inside before 
they brought up the portable 
weapons, he would be home safe. 
Small-arms fire didn’t worry him too 
much; the suit’s armor seemed to 
have handled it well so far. Witten 
stuck his head carefully around the 
corner again and studied the en- 
trance. 

What if the door was locked? He 
wouldn’t have time to try to figure 
it out. He hefted the atomic torch 
and adjusted its position so he could 
get to it easily. Every second was 
going to count. He dialed the suit 
to emergency power. 

Now! Witten stepped around the 
corner and dropped to one knee. 
He raised the launcher and took 
aim. 

The blast from the first ex- 
plosion ruined his aim on the sec- 
ond tank. However, he judged the 
near-miss had done enough damage. 
He was more careful on the third 
and fourth shots and scored direct 
hits. An instant after the last shot 
he was up and running. 

M ost of the greenies who had 
been deployed around the 



64 



IF 




tanks had disappeared; here and 
there a mangled trunk or an arm 
or leg lay cm the groimd. When he 
was only a little over half way to 
the entrance, a puff of dust a few 
steps ahead informed him that some 
of the opposition was still alive. A 
second later he suffered the fami- 
liar impact and concussion of a hit 
on his suit. 

Witten looked over his shoulder 
as he ran and saw greenies in al- 
most every window of the building 
across the street. The snouts of 
heavy weapons protruded from sev- 
eral windows. He fired four or five 
shots over his shoulder without miss- 
ing a stride and was gratified to see 
the front of the building collapse. 
Running past the tank he had al- 
most mTssed, he noticed globules of 
metal had formed on one side where 
armor plate had liquified, run and 
solidified. 

Witten reached the entrance amid 
a hail of bullets. He pushed the 
door, but it failed to open. There 
was no sign of a knob. He was rais- 
ing the torch when a tremendous ex- 
plosion smashed him into the side 
of the building. 

Witten climbed up out of the 
rubble; the damned door was still 
closed. He flipped on the torch. 
Witten cut through the lock mechan- 
ism and kicked open the door amid 
a splatter of molten metal. 

The interior of the building was 
pitch black to his half-blinded eyes. 
Another shell landed just short out- 
side and knocked him through the 
doorway. Witten scrambled around 
the corner on his hands and knees 
and hurried on down the corridor 



so as to be out of the line of fire. 
The i^ace was built like a fort; the 
walls were of stone and about two 
feet thick. The direction finder 
pointed to the interior of the buildf 
ing, so Witten took the first corridor 
to the left. It ended in a heavy 
metal door. This time he didn’t 
even hunt for the knob or the latch 
or whatever the inhabitants used for 
opening doors. Witten used the torch 
and stepped through the door. 

Inside was a gloomy hall littered 
with piles of smoking rubble. The 
only light came from a circular sky- 
light in the vaulted ceiling some fif- 
ty feet above. His light cut a swath 
through the smokey air. 

Witten knew he had to move fast. 
There was no telling how long it 
would be before the greenies got 
up enough nerve to follow him into 
the building. What had kept them 
out in the first place? 

He played the light over the floor 
and started towards the center of 
the room. The beam picked out a 
lean brown corpse. He stopped 
rolled the body over with his foot, 
and studied it for a second before 
going on. 

Its lower jaw had been torn off 
and on one arm was a livid hand- 
print in crushed flesh. 

He stumbled on three more bod- 
ies before he reached the center of 
the room. Two of them had been 
burned nearly in two by a beamer, 
and the other seemed to have been 
bludgeoned to death. 

Witten switched the suit’s loud- 
speaker to its highest volume and 
called Skinner’s name several times. 
He listened after the echoes had 



THfc KEHLE BLACK 



65 




died away, but there was no reply. 

Witten checked the direction fin- 
d^, but the needle flickered wildly 
afcut. He played the light around 
thb circumference of the room and 
understood why the greenies were 
still outside. Aside from the door by 
which he had entered, there was 
only one other entrance to the 
building; it opened directly into the 
hall. It was barricaded with fur- 
niture and the wall near it was 
criss-crossed with beamer scars. He 
pictured the greenies trying to rush 
the door against a laser beam; it 
would be hopeless. 

Skinner must be somewhere in 
the room. 

Suddenly the whole building 
rocked to a terrific explosion. Plas- 
ter fell like anow and at the front 
of the room a huge beam crashed 
to the floor. Witten flashed his light 
over to where he had seen a slight 
movement. 

A second later he was kneeling at 
Skinner’s side. 

IV 

T he huge frame was propped up 
against the top of an over- 
turned table. Skinner still held his 
beamer tight in his fist. Witten 
shined the light into Skinner’s face 
and then flashed it hastily away. 

What he had seen sickened him. 
The synthaflesh was blackened and 
contracted by heat, and the left side 
of the face, including the eye, 
seemed to have been scraped away. 
Metal gleamed through in several 
places. The other eye, however, 
gleamed with life. Witten realized 



that either the speech or auditory 
equipment, or both, must be dam- 
aged. 

“Skinner, can you hear me?” His 
voice boomed out with earthshatter- 
ing strength and echoed through 
the hall. Witten thumbed the volume 
down. 

Skinner shook himself and waved 
his right hand weakly. A sound like 
a cross between a cough and a belch 
issued from his ruined face. He 
shook his head and tried again. The 
result was no better. “Take it easy,” 
Witten said. “I’ll have you out of 
here in a minute. Can you walk?” 
Skinner shook his head negatively. 
Witten shined the light over his 
body and immediately wished he 
hadn’t. What he saw was, if any- 
thing, worse than the face. 

The left side was crushed and the 
left leg, from the knee down, 
seemed to have been cleanly amp- 
utated by some colossal knife. Wit- 
ten kept reminding himself that it 
wasn’t flesh and blood, only steel, 
plastic, and wire. “Are you in pain? 
Is there anything I can do?” 

Skinner shook his head no to 
both questions. However, he made 
no effort to get up. 

Witten tried to think. Obviously 
he couldn’t call the flitter down now 
and load what was left of Skinner 
into it; the greenies would blast him 
into pieces the minute he stepped 
out of the building. Only the great 
speed of the power suit had saved 
him before. Carrying Skinner, he 
wouldn’t have a chance. He flipped 
on the radio, “Stade?” 

“Yes. I’m here.” The quickness of 
his reply conjured up a picture of 



66 



IF 




him sitting expectantly on the edge 
of his chair. “Have you found Skin- 
ner yet?” 

“Yes.” Witten paused. “He’s in 
pretty bad shape. Thanks for keep- 
ing them off our backs. Now listen, 
here’s what you do. Project a circle 
about ten miles in diameter with us 
in the center. Launch six missiles 
from the ship. Have each one punch 
in equidistantly around the rim of 
the circle. Adjust the yield settings 
so we get a fourth-magnitude blast 
here.” 

“Good God! That’ll destroy the 
whole city . 

“Do it,” Witten cut him off, “ex- 
actly at 17:23. That’s seven minutes 
from now. Okay? 17:23 on the sec- 
ond.” 

“All right.” 

W itten snapped off the radio 
and stood up. He said to 
Skinner, “Let me know if you want 
anything.” He picked the big man 
up and slung him over his shoulder. 

Even in the power suit, it was 
rough going. He took a roll of wire 
from his belt and lashed the other 
man to him as best he could. Ab- 
ruptly Witten wondered why the 
greenies had been quiet for so long. 
Of course, they had other things on 
their minds. 

Which way out? 

He eyed the two doors and tried 
to make up his mind. The issue was 
decided for him as the main door 
and most of the barricade in front 
of it disintegrated in a jarring ex- 
plosion. Witten staggered but kept 
his feet. Should he make a run for 
the other door? Already greenies 



were swarming in the just-opened 
aperture. Weighed down as he was, 
they’d catch him before he made it. 
Okay, right down the gut. 

Witten swung the torch up and 
trotted towards the main entrance. 
Ten or fifteen greenies had climbed 
through the tangle of wreckage that 
still partially blocked the entrance. 
They seemed thrown into confusion 
at his approach. Before they could 
fire, Witten switched on the torch. 

Although he was' still twenty feet 
away from them, the effect was 
more than sufficient. They were 
subjected to a wave of heat that im- 
mediately roasted the ones directly 
in front of the torch and set fire 
to the uniforms of those around 
its periphery. Several exploded in a 
confusion of detonating ammunition 
belts; others afire clambered fran- 
tically over the rubble, already dead 
without knowing it. One of them 
blundered direcdy into Witten, who 
grabbed the thin neck in one mailed 
fist and squeezed. The thing weakly 
flailed its limbs. Witten squeezed 
harder and felt something snap. Its 
eyes bulged out incredibly, and a 
hair-thin vertical line suddenly 
dilated into a gaping hole that cov- 
ered half of its face. 

So that’s how they eat, Witten 
thought, and tossed the body aside. 

He stopped just inside the en- 
trance and stuck his head around 
the corner. Witten found himself 
almost face to face with another 
group of greenies. The surprise was 
mutual. He managed to get his 
torch up and on before his oppon- 
ents could raise their heavy weap- 
ons, though several lighter projec- 



THE KEHLE BLACK 



67 




tiles bounced harmlessly off his ar- 
mor. 

Witten peered outside through 
the smoke and made out just what 
he had feared. The greenies had re- 
inforced their forces around the 
building. Barricades, tanks, and 
heavy weapons were everywhere. He 
retreated from the rain of shells. The 
thick wall protected him from a 
direct hit, and his suit saved him 
from chips of stone and from con- 
cussion. 

Witten’s chronometer showed a 
little over three and a half minutes 
to go before the rockets were due. 
He had to be in the open when they 
hit, otherwise the two of them might 
be buried under tons of wreckage if 
the already battered structure de- 
cided to give way. 

Two minutes and forty-five sec- 
onds to go. 

W itten picked off two tanks that 
began firing into the building. 
The others seemed content to wait 
for the rest of their forces to get in- 
to position. He waited and waited. 
They think they’ve got all the time 
in the world, he reminded himself. 

After two more minutes had 
passed, Witten stuck his head 
around the corner again and nearly 
had it blown off. He stuck a full slip 
into his rocket launcher and dialed 
the warheads to high yield. He 
stuck the launcher around the cor- 
ner and started pulling the trigger as 
fast as he could. Then Witten was 
around the corner running and fir- 
ing. He got five more shots before 
he was knocked down by a com- 
bination of his own blasts and two 



near hits from tanks. Witten lay 
stunned for an instant. Then he was 
up and running again. 

Although Skinner slowed him and 
there was something wrong with the 
extender on the left leg of his suit, 
he managed to get almost to the 
middle of the street before Stade’s 
rockets hit. 

Witten was nothing. Abruptly a 
disagreeably bright play of colors 
floated into the darkness, and he 
shook his head complainingly. His 
body began to throb. Witten opened 
his eyes. 

Aside from the glare from a dozen 
or more fires in the upper stories, 
he could make out very little about 
the buildings around him; a thick 
smoke had rolled in from some- 
where. Witten struggled to his feet 
and found Skinner on the ground 
beside him. The wire had broken. 

The huge frame seemed lifeless, 
but that meant nothing. Skinner 
might still be conscious in the 
ruined mass of metal and plastic. 
The necessities for life, the basic 
nutrient and the brain case and 
pump, were heavily armored. Wit- 
ten flipped on his radio and called 
hoarsely into the mike. “Stade, get 
down here fast. Hurry up, damn 
it.” 

To him the flitter, when it ap- 
peared overhead, was the most beau- 
tiful sight in this or any other 
world. 

Two hours later Witten and Slade 
sat in the ship’s dispensary while the 
automedic clucked sympathetically 
and moved its appendages over 
what was left of Skinner. A chime 
sounded somewhere in the machine. 



68 



IF 




Stade took the diagnostic card that 
appeared in a slot. 

“How does it look?** Witten 
asked. 

“All right, I guess. He’ll have to 
stay in the machine until we get 
back, but we can rig up some photo- 
cells and sensory equipment. There’s 
no real danger.” 

“The bastards!” Witten clenched 
his fists. “You can never trust 
them. We ought to . 

Stade interrupted. “That’s not the 
way to look at it. It’s just that to 
them we were fair game. They think 
just like we do. Look at Ceton II 
and Cowper. We get along fine . .” 

“Yeah. And look at Wolf IV and 
Paradise and Wilson,” Witten grit- 
ted. “Skinner told me a lot about 
the greenies. In the end, it’s either 
going to be us or them, us or the 
greenies.” 

Stade looked at him with con- 
fusion and a growing recognition. 

V 

S tade was brought back- to the 
present by a persistent pain in 
his side. He took a pill from the 
table beside his bed and swallowed 
it. 

The pills didn’t do much good 
any more, and he knew things were 
going to get worse. There were only 
a few varieties of cancer that were 
still incurable, but he had an inoper- 
able case of one of them that had 
grown with almost unbelievable 
speed. 

There was a knock on the door 
and Witten came in. He was even 



bigger and broader than Stade re- 
membered him. For awhile they 
talked as people in such situations 
have always talked — of the weather, 
of the hospital food and the nurses. 
When Witten got up to leave, Stade 
picked up the book. “Here’s a little 
present for you. Even aside from its 
historical value, it’s worth reading. 
It’s about some of your ancestors.” 

Witten smiled. “I*m from Carman, 
one of the first colonies. My an- 
cestors came from Africa.” 

“Not all of them,” StAde said. 
“Some of them were in North 
America almost from the first.” 

Witten took the gift and made the 
proper sounds of appreciation and 
approval. Outside in the corridor, he 
looked at .it again. 

It was too bad that old Stade was 
dying, he thought. He always was 
rather strange; giving me a book — 
he nrobably even went to some 
trouble to get it. He looked at the 
strange title once more and then 
pocketed the book. A few moments 
later he stepped blinking into the 
sunshine where his friend waited for 
him. 

Skinner was resplendent in a new 
body that was even bigger and 
more powerful than the one he had 
had before. 

Witten looked up at the symme- 
trical planes of his face and asked, 
“Have you ever heard of a book 
named Uncle Tom’s Cabin?” Skin- 
ner shook his head from side to 
side and they walked away, the ivory 
of Skinner’s svnthaflesh contrasting 
pleasantly in the sunshine with Wit- 
ten’s ebony skin. END

IF • Short Story 



Nine Hundred Grandmothers 

by R. A. LAFFERTY 



( ~^eran Swicegood was a promising 
young Special Aspects Man. 
But, like all Special Aspects, he had 
one irritating habit. He was forever 
asking the question: How Did It All 
Begin? 

They all had tough names except 
Ccran. Manbreaker Crag, Heave 
Huckle, Blast Berg, George Blood, 
Move Manion (when Move says 
“Move”, you move), Trouble Trent. 
They were supposed to be tough, 
and they had taken tough names 
at the naming. Only Ceran kept his 
own — to the disgust of his com- 
mander, Manbreaker. 

“Nobody can be a hero with a 
name like Ceran Swicegood!” Man- 
breaker would thunder. “Why don’t 
you take Storm Shannon? That’s 
good. Or Gutboy Barrelhouse or 
Slash Slagle or Nevel Knife? You 
barely glanced at the suggested 
list.” 

“I’ll keep my own,” Ceran always 



Ws not so odd to hav& ancestors. 
But these people's ancestors were 
still quite alive — all of themi 



said, and that is where he made his 
mistake. A new name will some- 
times bring out a new personality. 
It had done so for George Blood. 
Though the hair on George’s chest 
was a graft job, yet that and his 
new name had turned him from a 
boy into a man. Had Ceran assumed 
the heroic name of Gutboy Barrel- 
house he might have been capable 
of rousing endeavors and man-sized 
angers rather than his tittering in- 
decisions and flouncy furies. 

They were down on the big aster- 
oid Proavitus — a sphere that almost 
tinkled with the potential profit that 
might be shaken out of it. And the 
tough men of the Expedition knew 
their business. They signed big con- 
tracts on the native velvet-like bark 
scrolls and on their own parallel 
tapes. They impressed, inveigled and 
somewhat cowed the slight people 
of Proavitus. Here was a solid two- 
way market, enough to make them 



70 



slaver. And there was a whole world 
of oddities that could lend them- 
selves to the luxury trade. 

“Everybody’s hit it big but you,** 
Manbreaker crackled in kindly thun- 
der to Ceran after three days there. 
“But even Special Aspects is sup- 
posed to pay its way. Our charter 
compels us to carry one of your 
sort to give a cultural twist to the 
thing, but it needn’t be restricted 
to that. What we go out for every 
time, Ceran, is to cut a big fat hog 
in the rump, we make no secret of 
that. But if the hog’s tail can be 
shown to have a cultural twist to it, 
that will solve a requirement. And if 
that twist in the tail can turn us a 
profit, then we become mighty 
happy about the whole thing. Have 
you been able to find out any- 
thing about the living dolls, for in- 
stance? They might have both a cul- 
tural aspect and a market value.” 
“The living dolls seem a part of 
something much deeper,” Ceran 
said. “There’s a whole c-omplex of 
things to be unraveled. The key may 
be the statement of the Proavitoi 
that they do not die.” 

“I think they die pretty young, 
Ceran. All those out and about are 
young, and those I have met who 
do not leave their houses are only 
middling old.” 

“Then where are their cemeter- 
ies?” 

“Likely they cremate the old 
folks when they die.” 

“Where are the crematories?” 
“They might just toss the ashes 
out or vaporize the entire remains. 
Probably they have no reverence fw 
ancestors.” 



“Other evidence shows their en- 
tire culture to be based on an ex- 
aggerated reverence for ancestors.” 
“You find out, Ceran. You’re 
Special Aspects Man.” 

C eran talked to Nokoma, his 
Proavitoi counterpart as trans- 
lator. Both were expert, and they 
could meet each other halfway in 
talk. Nokoma was likey feminine. 
There was a certain softness about 
both the sexes of the Proavitoi, but 
the men of the Expedition believed 
that they had them straight now. 

“Do you mind if I ask some 
straight questions,” Ceran greeted 
her today. 

“Sure is not. How else I learn 
the talk well but by talking.” 
“Some of the Proavitoi say that 
they do not die, Nokoma. Is this 
true?” 

“How is not be true? If they die, 
they not be here to say they do 
not die. Oh, I joke, I joke. No, we 
do not die. It is a foolish alien 
custom which we see no reason to 
imitate. On Proavitus, only the low 
creatures die.” 

“None of you dies?” 

“Why no. Why should one want 
to be an exception in this?” 

“But what do you do when you 
get very old?” 

“We do less and less then. We 
come to a deficiency of energy. Is 
it not the same with you?” 

“Of course. But where do you 
go when you become exceedinglv 
old?” 

“Nowhere. We stay at home then. 
Travel is for the young and those of 
the active years.” 



KINE HUNDRED GRANDMOTHERS 



71 




“Let’s try it from the other end,” 
Ceran said. “Where are your father 
and mother, Nokoma?” 

“Out and about. They aren’t real- 
ly old.” 

“And your grandfathers and 
grandmothers?” 

“A few of them still get out. The 
older ones stay home.” 

“Let’s try it this way. How many 
grandmothers do you have, No- 
koma?” 

“I think I have nine hundred 
grandmothers in my house. Oh, I 
know that isn’t many, but we are 
the younger branch of a family. 
Some of our clan have very great 
numbers of ancestors in their hous- 
es.” 

“And all these ancestors are 
alive?” 

“What else? Who would keep 
things not alive? How would such' 
be ancestors?” 

Ceran began to hop around in 
his excitement. 

“Could I see them?” he twittered. 

“It might not be wise for you to 
see the older of them,” Nokoma 
cautioned. “It could be an unsettling 
thing for strangers, and we guard 
it. A few t«is of them you can 
see, of course.” 

Then it came to Ceran that he 
might be onto what he had looked 
for all his life. He went into a panic 
of expectation. 

“Nokoma, it would be finding the 
key!” he fluted. “If none of you 
has ever died, then your entire race 
would still be alive!” 

“Sure. Is like you count fruit. 
You take none away, you stiU have- 
them all.” 



“But if the first of them are still 
alive, then they might know their 
origin! They would know how it 
began! Do they? Do you?” 

“Oh, not I. I am too young for 
the Ritual.” 

“But who knows? Doesn’t some- 
one know?” 

“Oh, yes. All the old ones know 
how it began.” 

“How old? How many genera- 
tions back from you till they 
know?” 

“Ten, no more. When I have ten 
generations of children, then I will 
also go to the Ritual.” 

“The Ritual, what is it?” 

“Once a year, the old people go 
to the very old people. They wake 
them up and ask them how it all 
began. The very old people tell them 
the beginning. It is a high time. Oh 
how they hottle and laugh! Then the 
very old people go back to sleep for 
another year. So it is passed down 
to the generations. That is the Rit- 
ual.” 

T he Proavitoi were not human- 
oid. Still less were they ‘mon- 
key-faces’, though that name was 
now set in the explorers’ lingo. They 
were upright and robed and 
swathed, and were assumed to be 
two-legged under their garments. 
Though, as Manbreaker said, “They 
might go on wheels for all we 
know.” 

They had remarkable flowing 
hands that might be called every- 
where-digited. They could handle 
tools, or employ their hands as if 
they were the most intricate tools. 
George Blood was of the opinion 



72 



IF 




that the Proavitoi were always 
madced, and that the men of the 
Expedition had never seen their 
faces. He said that those apparent 
faces were ritual masks, and that 
no part of the Proavitoi had ever 
been seen by the men except for 
those remarkable hands which per- 
haps were their real faces. 

The men had reacted with cruel 
hilarity when Ceran had tried to ex- 
plain to them just what a great dis- 
covery he was verging on. 

“Little Ceran is still on the how- 
did-it-begin jag,” Manbreaker jeered. 
“Ceran, will you never give off 
asking which came first, the chicken 
or the egg?” 

“I will have that answer very 
soon,” Ceran sang. “I have the 
unique opportunity. When I find 
how the Proavitoi began, I may 
have the clue to how everything be- 
gan. All of the Proavitoi are still 
alive, the very first generation of 
them.** 

“It passes belief that, you can be 
so simple-minded,” Manbreaker 
moaned. “They say that one has 
finally mellowed when he can suffer 
fools gracefully. By God, I hope I 
never come to that.” 

B ut two days later, it was Man- 
breaker who sought out Ceran 
Swicegood on nearly the same sub- 
ject. Manbreaker had been doing a 
little thinking and discovering of his 
own. 

“You are Special Aspects Man, 
Ceran,” he said, “and you have been 
running off after the wrong aspect.” 
“What is thatr 

“It don’t make a damn how it be- 
NINE HUNDRED GRANDMOTHERS 



gan. What is impOTtant m that it 
may not have to end.” 

“It is the beginning that I intend 
to discover,” said Ceran. 

“You fool, can’t you understand 
anything? What do the Proavitoi 
possess so uniquely that we don’t 
know whether they have it by 
science or by their nature or by fool 
luck?” 

“Ah, their chemistry, I suppose.” 

“Sure. Organic chemistry has 
come of age here. The Proavitoi 
have every kind of nexus and inhib- 
itor and stimulant. They can grow 
and shrink and telescope and pro- 
long what they will. These creatures 
seem stupid to me; it is as if they 
had these things by instinct. But 
they have them, that is what is im- 
portant. With these things, we can 
become the patent medicine kings 
of the universes, for the Proavitoi 
do not travel or make many outside 
contacts. These things can do any- 
thing or undo anything. I suspect 
that the Proavitoi can shrink cells, 
and I suspect that they can do some- 
thing else.” 

“No, they couldn’t shrink cells. 
It is you who talk nonsense now, 
Manbreaker.” 

“Never mind. Their things already 
make nonsense of conventional 
chemistry. With the pharmacopoeia 
that one could pick up here, a man 
need never die. That’s the stick 
horse you’ve been riding, isn’t it? 
But you’ve been riding it backward 
with your head to the tail. The 
Proavitoi say that they never die.” 

“They seem pretty sure that they 
don’t. If they did, they would be the 
first to know it, as Nokoma says.” 

73 




“What? Have these creatures hu- 
mor?” 

“Some” 

“But, Ceran, you don’t understand 
how big this is.” 

“I’m the only one who under- 
stands it so far. It means that if the 
Proavitoi have always been im- 
mortal, as they maintain, then the 
oldest of them are still alive. From 
them I may be able to learn how 
their species — and perhaps every 
species — began.” 

Manbreaker went into his dying 
buffalo act then. He tore his hair 
and near pulled out his ears by the 
roots. He stomped and pawed and 
went off bull-bellowing: 

“It don’t make a damn how it 
began, you fool! It might not have 
to end!!” so loud that the hills 
echoed back; 

“It don’t make a damn — you 
fool.” 

C eran Swicegood went to the 
house of Nokoma, but not with 
her on her invitation. He went 
without her when he knew that she 
was away from home. It was a 
sneaky thing to do, but the men of 
the Expedition were trained in 
sneakery. 

He would find out better without 
a mentor about the Nine Hundred 
Grandmothers, about the rumored 
living dolls. He would find out what 
the old people did do if they didn’t 
die, and find if they knew how they 
were first born. For his intrusion, he 
counted on the innate politeness of 
the Proavitoi. 

The house of Nokoma, of all the 
people, was in the cluster on top of 



the large flat hill, the Acropolis of 
Proavitus. They were earthen hous- 
es, though finely done, and they had 
the appearance of growing out of 
and being 'a part of the hill itself. 

Ceran went up the winding, as- 
cending flagstone paths, and en- 
tered the house which Nokoma had 
once pointed out to him. He en- 
tered furtively, and encountered one 
of the nine hundred grandmothers — 
one with whom nobody need be fur- 
tive. 

The grandmother was seated and 
small and smiling at him. They 
talked without real difficulty, though 
it was not so easy as with Nokoma, 
who could meet Ceran halfway in 
his own language. At her call, there 
came a grandfather who likewise 
smiled at Ceran. These two ancients 
were somewhat smaller than the 
Proavitoi of active years. They were 
kind and serene. There was an at- 
mosphere about the scene that bare- 
ly missed being an odor — not un- 
pleasant, sleepy, reminescent of 
something, almost sad. 

“Are there those here older than 
you?” Ceran asked earnestly. 

“So many, so many, who could 
know how many?” said the grand- 
mother. She called in other grand- 
mothers and grandfathers older and 
smaller than herself, these no more 
than half the size of the active 
Proavitoi — small, sleepy, smiling. 

Ceran knew now that the Proa- 
vitoi were not masked. The older 
they were, the more of character 
and interest there was in their faces. 
It was only of the immature active 
Proavitoi that there could have been 
a doubt. No masks could show 



74 



IF 




such calm and smiling old age as 
this. The queer textured stuff was 
their real faces. 

So old and friendly, so weak and 
sleepy, there must have been a 
dozen generations of them there 
back to the oldest and smallest. 

“How old are the oldest?” Ceran 
asked the first grandmother. 

“We say that all are the same age 
since all are perpetual,” the grand- 
mother told him. “It is not true that 
all are the same age, but it is indeli- 
cate to ask how old.” 

“You do not know what a lobster 
is,” Ceran said to them, trembling, 
“but it is a creature that will boil 
happily if the water on him is heat- 
ed, slowly. He takes no alarm, for 
he does not know at what point the 
heat is dangerous. It is that gradual 
here with me. I slide from one 
degree to another with you and my 
credulity is not alarmed. I am in 
danger of believing anything about 
you if it comes in small doses, and 
it will. I believe that you are here 
and as you are for no other reason 
than that I see you and touch you. 
Well, I’ll be boiled for a lobster 
then before I turn back from it. 
Are there those here even older 
than the ones present?” 

The first grandmother motioned 
Ceran to follow her. They went 
down a ramp through the floor in- 
to the older part of the house which 
must have been under ground. 

L iving dolls! They were here in 
rows on the shelves, and sitting 
in small chairs in their niches. Doll- 
sized indeed, and several hundred of 
them. 



Many had wakened at the intrus- 
ion. Others came awake when 
spoken to or touched. They were in- 
credibly ancient, but they were cog- 
nizant in their glances and recog- 
nition. They smiled and stretched 
sleepily, not as humans would, but 
as very old puppies might. Ceran 
spoke to them, and they understood 
each other surprisingly. 

“Lobster, lobster,” said Ceran to 
himself, “the water has passed the 
danger point! And it hardly feels 
different. If you believe your senses 
in this, then you will be boiled alive 
in your credulity.” 

He knew now that the living 
dolls were real and that they were 
the living ancestors of the Proavitoi. 

Many of the little creatures began 
to fall asleep again. Their waking 
moments were short, but their sleeps 
seemed to be likewise. Several of 
the living mummies woke a second 
time while Ceran was still in the 
room, woke refreshed from very 
short sleeps and were anxious to 
talk again. 

“You are incredible!” Ceran cried 
out, and all the small and smaller 
and still smaller creatures smiled 
and laughed their assent. Of course 
they were. All good creatures ev- 
erywhere are incredible, and were 
there ever so many assembled in one 
place? But Ceran was greedy. A 
roomful of miracles wasn’t enough. 

“I have to take this back as far 
as it will go!” he cried avidly. 
“Where are the even older ones?” 
“There are older ones and yet 
older and again older,” said the first 
grandmother, “and thrice-over older 
ones, but perhaps it would be wise 



NINE HUNDRED GRANDMOTHERS 



75 




not to seek to be too wise. You have 
seen enough. The old people are 
sleepy. Let us go up again.” 

Go up again, out of this? Ceriui 
would not. He saw passages and 
descending ramps, down into the 
heart of the great hill itself. There 
were whole worlds of rooms about 
him and under his feet. Ceran went 
on and down, and who was to stop 
him? Not dolls and creatures much 
smaller than dolls. 

Manbreaker had once called him- 
self an old pirate who reveled in 
the stream of his riches. But Ceran 
was the Young Alchemist who was 
about to find the Stone itself. 

He walked down the ramps 
through centuries and millennia. 
The atmosphere he had noticed on 
the upper levels was a clear odor 
now — sleepy, half-remembered, smil- 
ing, sad and quite strong. That is 
the way Time smells. 

4 4 A re there those here even older 
than you?” Ceran asked a 
small grandmother whom he held in 
the palm of his hand. 

“So old and so small that I could 
hold in my hand,” said the grand- 
mother in what Ceran knew from 
Nokoma to be the older uncom- 
pounded form of the Proavitus lan- 
guage. 

Smaller and older the creatures 
had been getting as Ceran went 
through the rooms. He was boiled 
lobster now for sure. He had to be- 
lieve it all; he saw and felt it. The 
wren-sized grandmother talked and 
laughed and nodded that there were 
those far older than herself, and in 
doing so she nodded herself back 



to sleep. Ceran returned her to her 
niche in the hive-like wall where 
there were thousands of others, min- 
iaturized generations. 

Of course he was not in the house 
of Nokoma now. He was in the 
heart of the hill that underlay all 
the houses of Proavitus, and these 
were the ancestors of everybody on 
the asteroid. 

“Are there those here even older 
than you?” Ceran asked a small 
grandmother whom he held on the 
tip of his finger. 

“Older and smaller,” she said, 
“but you come near the end.” 

She was asleep, and he put her 
back in her place. The older they 
were, the more they slept. 

He was down onto solid rock 
under the roots of the hill. He was 
into the passages that were cut out 
of that solid rock, but they could 
not be many or deep. He had a 
sudden fear that the creatures would 
become so small that he could not 
see them or talk to them, and so 
he would miss the secret of the be- 
ginning. 

But had not Nokoma said that all 
the old people knew the secret? Of 
course. But he wanted to hear it 
from the oldest of them. He would 
have it now, one way or the other. 

“Who is the oldest? Is this the 
end of it? Is this the beginning? 
Wake up! Wake up!” he called 
when he was sure he was in the 
lowest and oldest room. 

“Is it ritual?” asked some who 
woke up. Smaller than mice they 
were, no bigger than bees, maybe 
older than both. 

“It is a special Ritual,” Ceran 



76 



IF 




told them. “Relate to me bow it 
was in the beginning.” 

What was that sound — too 
slight, too scattered to be a noise? 
It was like a billion microbes 
laughing. It was the hilarity of little 
things waking up to a high time. 

“Who is the oldest of all?” Ceran 
demanded, for their laughter both- 
ered him. “Who is the oldest and 
first.” 

“I am the oldest, the ultimate 
grandmother,” one said gaily. “All 
the others are my children. Are 
you also of my children?” 

“Of course,” said Ceran, and the 
small laughter of unbelief flittered 
out from the whole multitude of 
them. 

“Then you must be the ultimate 
child, for you are like no other. If 
you be, then it is as funny at the 
end as it was in the beginning.” 
“How was it in the beginning?” 
Ceran bleated. “You are the first. 
Do you know how you came to 
be?” 

“Oh, yes, yes,” laughed the ulti- 
mate grandmother, and the hilarity 
oi the small things became a real 
noise now. 

“How did it begin?” demanded 
Ceran, and he was hopping and 
skipping about in his excitement. 

“Oh, it was so funny a joke the 
way things began that you would 
not believe it,” chittered the grand- 
mother. “A joke, a joke!” 

“Tell me the joke then. If a joke 
generated your species, then tell me 
that cosmic joke.” 

“Tell yourself,” tinkled the grand- 
mother. “You are a part of the 
joke if you are of my children. Oh, 



it is too funny to believe. How 
good to wake up and laugh and 
go to sleep again.” 

Blazing green frustration! To be 
so close and to be balked by a 
giggling bee! 

“Don’t go to sleep again! Tell me 
at once how it began!” Ceran 
shrilled, and he had the ultimate 
grandmother between thumb and 
finger. 

“This is not Ritual,” the grand- 
mother protested. “Ritual is that you 
guess what it was few: three days, 
and we laugh and say *No, no, no, 
it was something nine times as wild 
as that. Guess some more.’” 

“I will not guess for three days! 
Tell me at once or I will crush 
you,” Ceran threatened in a quiver- 
ing voice. 

“I look at you, you look at me, I 
wonder if you will do it,” the ulti- 
mate grandmother said calmly. 

A ny of the tough men of the Ex- 
pedition would have done it — 
would have crushed her, and then 
another and another and another of 
the creatures till the secret was told. 
If Ceran had taken on a tough per- 
sonality and a tough name he’d have 
done it. If he’d been Outboy Barrel- 
house he’d have done it without a 
qualm. But Ceran Swicegood 
couldn’t do it. 

‘Tell me,” he pleaded in agony. 
“All my life I’ve tried to find out 
how it began, how anything began 
And you know!” 

“We know. Oh, it was so funny 
how it began. So joke! So fool, so 
clown, so grotesque thing! Nobody 
could guess, nob(^y could believe.” 



NINE HUNDRED GRANDMOTHERS 



77 




“Tell me! Tell me!” Ceran was 
ashen and hysterical. 

“No, no, you are no child of 
mine,” chortled the ultimate grand- 
mother. “Is too joke a joke to tell 
a stranger. We could not insult a 
stranger to tell so funny, so unbe- 
lieve. Strangers can die. Shall I 
have it on conscience that a strang- 
er died laughing?” 

“Tell me! Insult me! Let me die 
laughing!” But Ceran near died cry- 
ing from the frustration that ate him 
up as a- million bee-sized things 



laughed and hooted and giggled: 
“Oh, it was so funny the way it 
began!” 

And they laughed. And laughed. 
And went on laughing . until 
Ceran Swicegood wept and laughed 
together, and crept away, and re- 
turned to the ship still laughing. On 
his next voyage he changed his name 
to Blaze Bolt and ruled for ninety- 
seven days as king of a sweet sea 
island in M-81, but that is another 
and much more unpleasant story.

What history does not tell about 
England's brave defense — against 
the invasion that did not happeni 



“T do not say the French can- 
not come to England. I only say 
they cannot come by sea.” (Lord 
Collingswood in the House of Lords, 
reported by C. S. Forester.)

Exploration Society.) 



Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



I 

S ir Hubert Wulf-Leigh was a four- 
bottle man. Every night four 
pints of the acrid yet sweet wine 
called Rossa slipped down his gul- 
let to the obvious discomfort of his 
liver. Heavy set, given a little 'o 
fat, his face flecked with the 



79 



brownish mottlings of cirrhotic 
disease, at thirty-two he was a poor 
bet to see his fortieth birthday. With 
him would perish the last of the 
Barons Minor (hereditary Knights) 
of Wulf-Leigh. And the plain fact of 
it was that Sir Hubert didn’t care. 

For these were heroic times, the 
long years of the war against Naf- 
lin the usurper, King Elective of 
the revolution riven Kingdom of 
Fraunce. An enlarged heart had 
kept the Baron Minor from serv- 
ing actively in the armed forces; 
a rejected heart, cast aside by a 
young lady with a cruel proclivity 
for classing the medically unfit as 
cowards, had started him on the 
road downward toward the ship- 
wreck of his health via the bot- 
tle and the bawdy house. 

Yet there was still a space of 
about five hours each day between 
the morning’s bottle fatigue and the 
late afternoon’s thirty craving 
when Hubert was able to perform 
useful work. He served in those 
hours as Particular and Confiden- 
tial Clerk to the Board of Lord 
High Admirals. The nature of the 
job (the result of one of the Lord 
High Admirals’ remembrance of 
past friendship for Wulf-Leigh’s late 
father), was the close examination of 
enemy documents (periodicals, gov- 
ernment bulletins and the like) 
which trickled into England by 
various means. From them he took 
useful intelligence. 

On the day in question he was 
perusing the back pages of Observa- 
tor National, the official paper of 
the Naflon government. These back 
pages were concerned with the eco- 



nomic decrees of the regime. Sud- 
dnly. Sir Hubert noticed an item 
placed there by the chief agronomist 
of the Sunken Lands: “This year 
by order of the King Elective ten 
thousand Hekkares have been plant- 
ed to augment the regular crop of 
flax.” 

“That’s a funny one,” mused 
the Baron Minor. “Why the devil 
are they adding a third to their 
regular acreage in that crop? They 
can’t need that many new petti- 
coats. There is something here. 
Maybe Doll Broadrump will know. 
I’ll be seeing her tonight, and I’ll be 
sure to inquire.” 

D oll Broadrump kept one of the 
most exclusive brothels in 
Lindesnes. Running to fat (her once 
magnificent figure was now better 
described as ample) and a bit o’erly 
fond of the wine bottle, she found 
herself attracted to the High Ad- 
miral’s clerk by a perverse mutuali- 
ty. 

When the Sunken Lands matter 
occurred to him, he had already 
half undressed her. 

“Not so fast, Wilfy!” (This was 
an endearment based upon his name 
which was usually pronounced as a 
clipped Wilfly.) “You’ll have me 
all unstayed before I’m ready for 
it.” 

“I’m just practicing for the Fall 
when you’ll doubtless have two or 
more petticoats than you’re wearing 
now, smuggled over here along with 
your Freunch perfumes,” he teased 
her. 

“Coo, Wilfly, how you do talk. 
You’d think I buy from the smug-

glers, do you? Well, only a little, 
like perfumes and stuff. But cer- 
tainly I won’t be buying Linen Pet- 
ticoats. Why they’re classed as de- 
mode now.” 

The thick set lover was puzzled 
by this response. “Demode? That 
means out of fashion, doesn’t it? 
That doesn’t go with information 
I’ve acquired. Are you sure of your 
facts?” 

“Am I sure? Let me off your lap 
for a moment, ducks, and I’ll show 
you.” Dolly began rummaging 
through an overstuffed disorderly 
armoire. “Here we are, lad. This

in Naflon’s kingdom. It’s said she 
sleeps with Naflon when his queen 
is otherwised disposed. Now read 
this here. Underlinens shall not be 
of that material any longer. Petti- 
coats shall be of silk to cling to 
the figure with gentility and grace. 
You can bet our ladies will be fol- 
lowing that trend. So by the fall 
there won’t be a petticoat of linen 
worn by a fashionable lady in lin- 
desnes.” 

“So this Madame Godolfin rules 
the fashions for both England ^ind 
Fraunce. Maybe some of our peo- 
ple ought to talk to her, use her as 
a kind of a modern day Lysistrata. 
But that’s not in the Lord High 
Admiral’s purview. But you’ve giv- 
en me a useful lead. You shall have 
ten c’ronets beyond your usual two 
royals tonight.” 

Leaping back on Hubert’s lap, 
she exclaimed with proud and 
eager excitement: “Crikey, luvvy, 
ye’re n real gent!” 



T he next day Sir Hubert, when 
he finally whipped himself into 
his office, checked through the 
Observator again to see if he could 
make any connection through other 
surplus production. 

TTie only thing he noted was a 
rather querulous article above the 
signature of Naflon’s Minister of 
Conservation of Scarce Reources, 
complaining about the low surrender 
rate for tallow and its excessive use 
in the home for home supplies of 
candles. The article urged that he 
who is a good son of his country will 
not keep six candles burning in a 
room where two would do and in that 
way his deliveries of tallow could 
be raised by two or three pounds 
a week to the agents of the Min- 
istry of Conservation .... 

Wulf-Leigh labored through the 
afternoon trying to make a con- 
nection between flax and tallow 
and Naflon’s war. The only thought 
he had was of shoemaker’s thread; 
and he didn’t think that Naflon was 
going to paddle his way to England 
in a specially sewed, water-repelling 
cobbler’s invention. 

“Damn, there has to be some- 
thing. Well, no chance to find out 
now. I play cards with Munkertny 
tonight. Maybe he can enlighten 
me.” 

W 'ith an exaggerated deliberate- 
ness, Wulff-Leigh put down the 
picture cards with incantation: 
“Chief, Prince, and King of Swords 
and (playing the Ace) the Almighty 
One whose Sward cuts down even 



82 



IF 




Kings. That’s Skirmish, Battle and 
War. We have you on the hip 
again, Munkertny. At five Royals 
a Skirmish, we have you down nine 
to four; and five Royals on the bat- 
tle .. that’s thirty Royals you 
owe us additionally and twenty-five 
for the earlier games. That’s fifty- 
five bright boys you owe us.” 

“Biggah,” exploded Munkertny 
(Lord Henry Phillip Mountcourte- 
nay, Senior Captain in the Royal 
Navy.) “Playing with you, Sir Hu- 
bert, is a habit I shall have to fore- 
go. I can’t afford many evenings 
like this!” 

Wulf -Leigh shrugged off the 
complaint. “You probably take 
twenty times the value of this eve- 
ning’s little session from the Freunch 
in prize money. I’m just leveling 
off the inequities in the country’s 
wealth. It wouldn’t do for the 
Navy’s captains to grow too rich. 
With wealth comes independent 
thinking and with independent 
thinking grows disobedience to or- 
ders and the breakdown of all dis- 
cipline.” 

“Gah, Wilfly, it’s good you’re 
saying that smiling! This prize bit 
isn’t all you civilian side fellahs 
make it out to be. Last week we 
took a coaster making for Bullon 
on the coast near the Sunklands, 
and what do you think she had on 
board? One hundred madman’s tea 
pots! They were big enough to hold 
three barrels of tea. They had the 
spouts in the cover, and not one 
spout but two. And to top off every- 
thing else, they had a grommet and 
clamp arrangement for dogging 
down the cover. I’ll bet even Prisk- 



er, our chemistical genius, couldn’t 
tell me what those were for. They 
couldn’t be just ordinary urns for 
the army — Naflon hasn’t got more 
than seventy-five regiments in his 
whole demmed army.” 

Sir Andrew Priest-Kerr, Master of 
the Lord High Admiral’s Powder 
Works and brilliant analytical chem- 
ist who had partnered Sir Hubert 
in the game just concluded, thought 
for a minute and then asked quiet- 
ly: “Tell me, Munkertny, were 

these tea pots of yours porcelainized 
on the inside? I mean did they have 
a glassy smooth finish over the 
metal?. 

“Demme, Prisker, I believe you 
know the answer! Yes, they did 
have a glassy surface inside. What 
are they?” 

“Well, sir, if I were right in that 
deduction. I’d say your teakettles 
were not kettles at all but gas gen- 
erators. With a two-hole set up 
like that, the top would be lifted — 
fifty or a hundred pounds of zinc 
and fifty or sixty gallons of oil of 
vitriol put in one vent — stoppered 
— and ninety-thousand cubic feet 
of Hydrogen drawn off through the 
other before a new charge would 
be necessary.” 

“Hydrogen, eh?” sniffed Mount- 
courtenay. “Can’t say I’ve heard of 
the stuff. What’s it good for?” 

“It will produce the hottest flame 
imaginable without leaving an ash 
Since it’s about eighteen times as 
light as air, it can be used in bal- 
loons. You know this, of course — 
those cloth envelopes that are suf- 
ficiently lighter than air around 
them and thus can lift a weight of 



NOT BY SEA 



83 




men and materials to sail with the 
wind for hundreds of leagues.** 
“Gad, sir! Naflon wasting good 
shipping space to inflate children’s 
toys? It’s most incredible. You 
might even say disappointing. I 
thought we faced a worthier op- 
ponent. He’d do better to put his 
canvas into ship’s sails and com- 
ing out of his harbors to meet 
us.” 

“He can’t make them of can- 
vas,” snapped Priest-Kerr, ”it’s too 
heavy. The best stuff is heavy silk 
or other light, air-tight materials.” 
Wulf-Leigh got back into the dis- 
cussion. Remembering the economic 
note about the Sunken Lands, he 
asked quietly: “Could other light 
cloths like linen be used?” 

The powder master said, “Not 
usually. Linen is light but it’s too 
porous a weave to hold the gas 
properly. Linen rag paper could 
be used, but unfortunately the aero 
men don’t care to trust their lives 
to paper. You might use a close 
woven linen with an air-proofing 
compound spread over it.” 

“Could you — ” the baron minor 
was suddenly tense and hissing be- 
tween taut lips — “use tallow as 
such an air-proofing compound?” 
Prisker nodded. “Yes, 1 calcu- 
late you could. But why this sud- 
den concern with balloons?” 

T he victor at cards put the 
pieces together as carefully as 
he put together the “Suite of 
Swords” in the card game previous- 
ly. “Gentlemen, you have just giv- 
en me the clues — along with a 
certain woman named Doll Broad- 



rump— -that may block an invasion 
by Naflon.” 

The other three men at the table 
(the fourth was a Naval commisary 
officer) said as one, “Come now!” 

The captain spoke first. “Naflon 
wouldn’t have the nerve to send a 
thousand of his men over here. 
Why, our country folk would eat 
them alive.** 

“But suppose he sent not one 
thousand but three or five thou- 
sand? Suppose they could hold out 
long enough to do us some serious 
hurt, like burning the dockyards at 
Plymness or even capturing His 
Majesty with a quick swoop here 
on Lindesnes? Suppose they landed 
at Overwick with some Pantler 
claimant and raised Celtland? There 
are all sorts of deviltries they could 
manage.” 

Priest-Kerr finally ended the dis- 
cussion. “You know I’m not a real 
expert on these balloons. The best 
man for you to see is the Baron 
Lambruton. He’s a Freunchie and 
crossed the Sheeve by one of those 
sky wagons about four years before 
the revolution that ended by bring- 
ing the usurper to power. He’s also 
a red hot aristrocrat and broke 
with Naflon very quickly. You’ll 
find him at the Gafe des Exils.” 

C4'\Tou Anglias are savages. 

A When a bottle of Chamberg- 
non is at hand, to choose instead 
a glass of Rossa, that gut-corroding 
enormity of a wine! Well,” shrugged 
the Baron Lambruton, “when one 
is driven into foreign lands, you 
must put up with the barbarities of 
the natives. You had mentioned 



84 



IF 




business to me; please get on with 
it.” 

“Forgive me, please, my dear 
Baron, but my stomach is used 
to Rossa and I doubt if it would 
do justice to your admirable Cham- 
bergnon. As to the business, I am 
told by Sir Andrew Brisker, the 
Master of his Majesty’s Powder 
Works, that you are the greatest 
expert on ballooning now in Eng- 
land.” 

The Baron suddenly became ex- 
pansive. Ballooning was evidently 
the first love of his life. “TTie 
greatest in England, ma fois! There 
is none better than me in all 
Fraunce, or, for that matter, in 
the whole continent. You Angilas 
are preparing to use ballons in 
Scouting as I suggested to your 
government three years ago?” 

“No,” smiled Wulf-Leigh apolo- 
getically, “though it’s an idea. It’s 
Naflon who’s using the balloons 
and it’s my job to estimate the 
strength he’s using them. Can you 
give me some idea of the amount of 
weight one can lift?” 

The Baron’s brows knitted. “So, 
Naflon is using balloons! My ap- 
prentice, Fremeau, must be doing 
better there than I am here. This 
is not an easy thing to calculate. 
You know it depends on the height 
to which balloon is expected to as- 
cend. Is this use for spy work? 
No? A descent upon your uncon- 
querable isle? Ah, yes. Then the 
safest height to get above the shoot- 
ing range of your fleet would be 
three thousand feet. These balloons 
will naturally be of oiled silk, the 
best balloon cloth?” 



The bureaucrat shook his head. 
“I think not. I have reason to be- 
lieve that they are going to use 
a tight woven linen coated with tal- 
low. I have been given this infor- 
mation by a most reliable source.” 

“That is very possible, ma foil 
The usurper has one overriding 
fault. He is a cheap swine. He 
will throw away a coronet to save 
a groate’s worth of tar, or what 
ever your English expression is. 
Also, there is a distinct advantage 
in linen. If he is going to build 
up an airmada to invade your pre- 
viously impregnable kingdom, he 
will have to rely on inexperienced 
crews. After all, my dear Wulf- 
Leigh, in all Fraunce, in all the 
world, perhaps there are only three 
hundred Aeronauts. That means he 
will have to make the balloons of 
the most difficult to damage light 
cloth available. That could very 
well be your linen.” 

“Very good thinking, Lamber- 
ton,” mouthed the Particular secre- 
tary of the Lord High Admirals, 
“but tell me, is there any way to 
judge the amount of linen that the 
project would use?” 

“You will pardon me for my de- 
lay, ’sieu , Wulf-Leigh, but it is 
not the easiest thing for a man of 
Fraunce to think in English and 
it is not easy for an airman to 
think in ^terms of oiled silk and 
then have to revise one’s thinking 
to cover linen. 

“You see, cher ’sieu, that the 
varying weight of the cloth makes 
a difference in the amount of lift- 
ing power available to given ma- 
terial. Our usual estimate for oiled 



NOT BY SEA 



85 




silk, for example, is that eighteen 
hundred square feet of material 
will support one man in flight. With 
linen, we would need more. The 
envelope would then require per- 
haps two thousand feet. Any further 
questions, ’sieu?” 

“None at the moment, thank 
you. But I hope I can find you 
easily?” 

“Easily, cher ’sieu, as long as 
you pay for the wine.” 

m 

A few visits to linen establishments 
and a visit to the royal botanical 
gardens at Avenhouse near Lindes- 
nes added the other facts that he 
needed. 

He knew that the Freunch would 
get thirty-five bushels of flax to 
the Hekkare, that a bushel of flax 
would make two hundred square 
feet of tight-cloth per bushel; and 
he estimated that the Freunch would 
put half of their Sunken Lands area 
into production of balloon cloth. At 
any rate, be came to a final figure 
of two thousand balloons each cap- 
able of carrying three men as the 
potential strength of the Freunch 
assault. 

He drew up a paper outlining the 
piecing together of facts and con- 
jectures and submitted it to the 
Lord High Admirals. * 

The day following his submis- 
sion of the paper he was called to 
the office of Admiral Viscount 
Cockroftsbury-Stow, junior among 
the Lord High Admirals. The Ad- 
miral was pacing the floor as he 
had paced many a quarter-deck. 



“This is,” he began without pre- 
amble, “a brilliant piece of deduc- 
tive logic. Starting with a small 
paragraph in the Observator and 
picking up scraps of knowledge in 
brothels, at card tables and in toad- 
eaters’ cafes, you have figured out 
a whole scheme invasion. Only 
trouble is: I don’t believe It.” 

“Why not, your Lordship? I have 
challenged Senior Naval Captains 
men like Brisker, the Master of the 
Powder Works, and Lamberton, the 
best areonaut in the whole contin- 
ent, to pick flaws in my logic. And 
they haven’t been able to. Now 
you shoot up the whole works with 
a simple ‘I don’t believe it’. Why 
don’t you, my Lord?” 

“Young man, one of the privileg- 
es of being Lord High Admiral is 
that 1 don’t have to answer any 
man who asks me, ‘Why doest thou 
thus, or why don’t thou do that?’ — 
unless the person asking is a King 
or a King’s First Minister, And 
sometimes the latter eminence 
doesn’t get answers either. But in 
this case the answer is simple. You 
can’t expect a nation of toad-eaters 
to display that kind of imagination! 
You know, don’t you, that they all 
eat toads? Naflon eats toads, his 
first minister eats toads, every rud- 
dy Freunchie eats toads. If they 
can get down a little beast like that 
without chucking their guts, they 
lack imagination. That’s why the 
Royal Navy has always whipped 
them; superior imagination. That’s 
why King William’s army has never 
licked them on land. Our army 
blighters don’t have the same kind 
of imagination our tars have. Now 



86 



IF 




if we start giving the toad-eaters 
credit for that kind of imagination, 
it will wreck the morale of the 
whole ruddy navy!” 

“First of all,” rebutted Wulf- 
Leigh, “it’s not toads they eat but 
frogs. They’re not half bad. I’ve 
eaten them on occasion. And you 
have to give Naflon credit for im- 
agination — otherwise he’d never 
have risen from a half-pay captain 
of Sappeurs to the head of a great 
nation. That kind of imagination 
could scheme up this balloon plan. 

“So I should like to urge you to 
keep a close inshore watch on 
Bullon and at the first sign of the 
effectuation of the project take 
steps to protect the country from 
a hard blow.” 

Too late, the Baron Minor realiz- 
ed the faulty choice of words. Cock- 
roftsbury-Stow smiled icily. 

“My dear Wilfly, for forty years 
in the Navy, I’ve gotten used to 
hard blows. We’ve dealt as many as 
we’ve given. We are not going to 
panic the country with this talk of 
flying machines. You are forbidden, 
upon peril of your post and possibly 
imprisonment to tell or write far- 
ther on this theme. Am I under- 
stood, Wilfly?” 

Choking down a rough-tongued 
answer, the pleader answered stolid- 
ly: “Aye, Aye, sir.” 

T he lucid interval between 
end of hangover and beginning 
of thirst became shortened some- 
what as Wulf-Leigh graduated to 
the five-bottle class. The cirrhotic 
spots on his face became larger and 
better defined. Finally his physi- 



cian ordered him to take the waters 
at Inverhocking Spa, a noted hot 
springs in the Midlands. 

He expressed doubt as to any 
ultimate benefit but went there as 
obediently as he could. He bathed 
in the hot springs, clad in the white 
sackcloth robe that was the mark 
of the spa pilgrim, choked down 
the sulphur-reeking water that was 
drunk as part of the spa regimen 
and paid a timorous smuggler to 
bring him a bottle a day of the 
forbidden Rossa. 

Clad in the white robe of clinical 
penitence, he was on the fifth 
day of a fortnight’s projected stay 
and glumly gazing at the three 
quarter-full glass of rotten-egg water 
that he was supposed to empty with- 
in the next twenty minutes, when 
Lord High Admiral’s message ar- 
rived. 

It was short and to the point: 
“Come at once to the Lord Ad- 
mirals’. We were wrong; you were 
right. The Freunchies came out and 
there is hell to pay. Apologetically, 
Cockroftsbury-Stow.” 

Ten bone-jolting chattered stage 
hours later. Sir Hubert stood in 
the presence of a clearly chastened 
Viscount and listened to the ex- 
planation of the “Hell to Pay”. 
“You see, Wilfly, the King Elective 
had similar doubts too, so this bligh- 
ter in charge of the project — Fre- 
meau, I think that’s the name the 
intelligence chaps have given — de- 
cided to show the usefulness of the 
damn balloons in war. So they sent 
off a half dozen balloons and 
dropped explosive-laden shells on 
our fleet — dropping them from 



NOT BY SEA 



87 




four thousand feet, which was be- 
yond the range of any guns we had 
around there. They blew up two 
frigates and a ship o’ line and 
dismasted another frigate. Then when 
the breeze swung around again to 
an on-shore wind, they casually sailed 
back to Fraunce. Nation’s happy, 
Fremeau’s happy, but the Board of 
Lord High Admirals are not hap- 
py, not happy in the least. We’ve 
got to save our Navy from a de- 
moralization and possibly destruc- 
tion. If the blockade is broken 
and Naflon can get across the Nar- 
row seas without getting his feet 
wet, England is his for the taking. 
And he won’t even use your suicide 
squad method. Now our men are 
damned nervous every time there’s 
a wind shift in the offing. You’re 
the blounder who dug up this balloon 
scare in the first place. We’re look- 
ing to you for an answer.” 

W ilfly stroked his chin thought- 
fully, savoring the discomfort 
of the Viscount sitting before him. 
Finally the combination of pity and 
patriotism overcame him and he 
murmured: “I think we can save 
the fleet. It will entail a visit to 
S’r Andrew at the Royal Powder 
Works.” 

“Sir Andrew?” Cockroftsbury- 
Stowe looked baffled, then smiled. 
“Oh, you mean Prisker. He’s an odd 
sort of chap; knows all about stinks 
and stuff. Let’s go, my carriage 
awaits.” 

Sir Hubert dared to offer an 
amendment to this suggestion. “Since 
the powder works is up the river, 
can’t we go up there by the Ad- 



miral’s barge? a good upriver 
wind we can make as good time 
as we do by carriage, and my bot- 
tom’s still sore after that road from 
Inverhocking.” 

“By Jove, that’s a capital idea! I 
could stand a ride behind the wind 
horse today. We’ll go down by the 
water-gate.” 

Sir Andrew Priest-Kerr stalked 
the floor of his powder-blackened, 
brimstone smelling workshop. He 
was obviously annoyed at the ap- 
pearance of his distinguished visitor 
and even more annoyed in the 
breach of his private confidence by 
the Baron Minor. “Dammit, Wilfly! 
What I told you about isn’t fully 
tested, won’t be for about two 
weeks — and besides that it’s a sig- 
nalling device, not a weapon.” 

The Particular Clerk was used 
to spasms of annoyance on the part 
of the chemist. He shrugged it off. 
“Look, Prisker, suppose you (kxtbled 
the charge of your fire dltdEe. 
You’ve said the ones you have now 
reach two thousand feet. You cosdd 
very well make a fire drake go up 
four thousand feet and it ooi^ 
gain some extra altitude by em- 
placing it on the fore-t’gallant yard.” 

The Master of the Works 'riiook 
his head. “No, that would never 
do! My Lord, we’re talking of my 
fire drake, a signal flare impelled by 
a self-contained powder charge. 
Chap on one of the Asian stations 
gave me the idea. Saw something 
similar out there. Now Wilfly sug- 
gests putting it on the masthead. 
That’s a fool’s idea. The thing goes 
into the air and leaves a trril of 
burning powder grains behind it. 



IF 




IV 



Can you imagine what that would 
do to tarred ropes and canvas rig- 
ging?” 

The Viscount sniffed; “The man 
has a point, Wilfly. How do you 
answer that?” 

Once again the reflective pause. 
Then: “Fire the drake from a tri- 
pod atop an iron pot partly filled 
with water. Mount the pot on two 
right-angled swivels for aiming pur- 
poses, and let the sparks be kicked 
back into the pot. Put a gunner’s 
mate into the foretop to handle the 
aiming and firing — and there you 
are. How’s that idea seem to you, 
Prisker?” 

The answer was “top hole”. In 
three days the Powder Works began 
turning out the large sized fire 
drakes. 

Thirteen more days saw the 
strange installation put in the fore- 
tops of the blockading squadrons. 
On the eighteenth day after Wulf- 
Leigh had been pulled from the 
Spa cure at Inverhocking the 
Freunch came boiling out of Bullon 
again. 

This time, however, they came 
out to blazing ruin. Seven of the 
great gasbags were exploded by the 
high-climbing fire drakes with im- 
punity. Three, by jettisoning ballast 
and bombs alike, climbed above the 
range of the strange new weapon. 
One with a hit dismasted a frigate, 
and one balloon, flaming down by a 
strange quirk of wind, blew a piece 
of blazing cloth across the rigging 
of a second frigate and did severe 
damage to the masts, sails and run- 
ning rigging of the vessel by setting 
it on fire. 



T he Freunch figured the cost in 
trained aeronauts and never 
attacked the fleet again. 

They did not however renounce 
their main plan. Three weeks later 
the inshore watch established near 
bullon reported thirty balloons risen 
between sunrise and sunset, twice 
that many the next day and three 
times that many on the third day. 
They rose above the plains behind 
Bullon like so many Dhinni some- 
how enslaved by Nation’s conscript 
army. 

On the fourth day they sum- 
moned Wulf-Leigh again from the 
spa, where he had again gone for 
his liver’s sake, to the headquarters 
of the Lord High Admirals. This 
time Lord Cockroftsbury-Stowe was 
even more humble than on the oc- 
casion of his last summons. 

“Nation’s boys have fulfilled your 
predictions again, Wilfly. They’re 
raising those damn balloons at a 
rate that should give him near two 
thosand in two months — and that 
will be the season of the prevailing 
easterlies that will blow steadily for 
long enough to put the Freunchies 
over our country. 

“Where they strike depends on 
the wind compass. If the gales are 
blowing southeast by south they 
will be striking for Overwick with 
the Pantler pretender aboard. That’s 
the most northerly heading they can 
make. East by sou’east they’ll be 
down on the ridings of Doncaster, 
destroying the Iron Foundries of 
Middle England. Due East will be a 
swoop on Lindesnes, and East by 



NOT BY SEA 



89 




No’east will be the Navy’s blessing 
with a raid on Plymness. That last, 
sir, is where you come in. We’re dis- 
charging you as a particular Clerk 
of the board of Lord High Ad- 
mirals — ” the Admiral now paused 
in some amusement to watch the 
anguished protest start to form on 
the intelligence man’s face — “and 
appointing you Deputy Warden of 
the Ness, with full rights and pow- 
ers.” 

“Deputy Warden of the Ness!” 
There was still shock and amaze- 
ment in the voice of Wulf-Leigh. 
“That’s an ancient office, largely 
honorary, that hasn’t been filled 
since they cut off Henry Pander’s 
head a hundred and fifty years 
ago.” 

Cockroftsbury-Stowe smiled. “Yes, 
they cut off Henry’s head. But 
they didn’t abolish the office 
and now we’re glad they didn’t. 
Your office will encompass the de- 
fense of the Ness, of Plymness and 
of the three shires around it. That’s 
a large order. But it will be done 
with the equivalent of a rear ad- 
miral and you’ll also be amply com- 
pensated. You’ll be entitled to the 
Salt Beef Excise and the wine duty. 
That’s a c’ronet on every keg of 
salt beef taken down the Ness by 
the Navy, and in time of war that’s 
three hundred thousand kegs a 
year; and a half c’ronet on every 
keg of wine brought into any port 
in England. And that means five 
million kegs. That means two hun- 
dred and sixty thousand Royals in 
your pocket every year for the 
war’s duration and possibly for life 
. because as we go to a peacetime 



establishment the salt beef duty 
drops but the wine increment in- 
creases.” 

1 4 /^ orblemme,” gasped Sir Hu- 

vJTbert, “that’s a high wage! I 
hope that there’s a knighthood of 
one of the honorary orders to go 
with it.” 

“There’s that too. If the action 
falls out in your jurisdiction you’ll 
be certain to get William’s sword 
tap for King’s Strand if you suc- 
ceed — or — ” the admiral’s smile 
grew wry — ’’the heads man’s axe 
tap for treason if you fail.” 

“That’s putting it nicely. Wealth 
and honor if we triumph, ruin and 
a traitor’s grave if we fail. I’m giv- 
ing up wine for the duration and 
I’m taking the post so graciously of- 
fered. What forces will be under 
me? What crack regiments?” 

Cockroftsbury-Stowe shrugged. 
“I’m afraid you won’t have any 
crack regiments at all. You know 
our home establishment is twenty 
regiments. Of those seven are in the 
north, guarding Overwick and the 
Celtland border against the threat 
of a Pantler landing; four are in 
the midcountry riding to ward off 
the attack aimed at Doncaster and 
the foundries; and nine are emplaced 
around Lindensnes to protect an ex- 
pected assault on the King. It’s odd 
that the King, who can actually con- 
tribute less than anyone in the gov- 
ernment to the actual war effort, 
can be the most important piece on 
the board. If they catch him— but 
now I’m talking like a demmed Re- 
publican.”

to guard the Ness. Will that be left 
to the yeomanry?” 

“In part, yes.” The Lord High 
Admiral ticked off the forces avail- 
able on his fingers. “You’ll draw 
five thousand men from the train- 
bands of the three shires. There’ll 
be thirty-five himdred from the 
Royal Marine Force and fifteen hun- 
dred Jacktars acquainted with the 
countryside from Press gang work, 
officered by one hundred masters 
at arms from the fleet. You see lad, 
the navy has always taken care of 
its own — and we’re going to do it 
again at Plymnes.” 

“Well,” he smiled grimly, “it’s 
going to be an unusual defense at 
any rate. Will I have a good field 
leader under me?” 

“You’ll have Lieutenant Colonel 
Fitzwilliam, the chief Marine of- 
ficer of the home fleet. Also you 
can pick any senior captain that’s 
available to serve under you with 
the rank of commodore. Have you 
any preference?” 

“I think I’d like Munkertny. I 
know him well and feel I could 
work closely with him.” 

The admiral took a linen-bound 
notebook from a drawer of his desk 
and, leafing through it, mumblingly 
checked the name. “Good, sir, 
Munkertny it is. You’ll leave for 
the Ness on the night stage. Good 
luck, Wilfly.”

T he Warden’s Council of the 
Ness, dormant for nearly two 
hundred years, was in session. 

The dean of merchant captains. 



the captain of the dockyards, the 
merchant - provost, Commodore 
Mountcourtany, Major General 
Hammington (shortened to Hang- 
ton) of the Nesshires militia. Lieu- 
tenant Colonel Fitzwilliam (Fiswim) 
of the Marines and the Deputy 
Warden, Wulf-Leigh, who had in- 
itiated the council on the second 
day following his arrival, were gath- 
ered around a table in Navy House. 

Wulf-Leigh addressed them in no 
gentle terms. “Councillors, in about 
fifty days Naflon is going to attempt 
the invasion of England. It will not 
be in sufficient force to stay in the 
country, but enough to cause us a 
terrible hurt. If the wind favors him 
he may drop on the Ness and at- 
tempt to burn the dockyards. I say 
drop because as you know he’s com- 
ing by air with aeronaut balloonists. 
The attack will most likely be by 
night. Now you, Hangton, have said 
that any thrust upon the Ness will 
make its attack on the heights above 
the city. You say this because below 
the town, on one side of the Ness 
is heavy marshland, and on the 
other side is a narrow pass where 
a spur of those heights comes down 
to the sea. Now how about a land- 
ing in the town itself? You know 
that with balloons they can do that, 
don’t you?” 

Hammington was very deliberate 
about it. “No, sir, they can’t land 
in town. You’ve seen the rooves. 
They are packed close together and 
very steep in the eaves. There’s a 
few gardens, the bowls-green and a 
couple of common squares, but a 
planting of stakes and caltrops will 
make those unprofitable. No, the 



92 



IP 




landings have to come on the 
heights above the city. Or to be 
more exact, on the stony apron of 
Middle Moor.” 

“What is this stony apron you 
mention, and what’s Middle Moor?” 
“The stony apron of Middle 
Moor is a rock dike that the Creator 
made to hold back the waters of 
the springs that feed down to the 
Ness. It’s a zone about two miles 
square out in the ten mile square of 
the middle moor that is safe for 
men to walk upon and move about 
freely. The remainder of the square 
is usable only on the trails of the 
moor-trotters, and no man knows 
them save the moor-trotters.” 

The Merchant Provost said fierce- 
ly: “If we could get em sommes to 
land on High Moor Apron instead 
of Middle Moors, ’e could drown 
’em in the bogs of Middle Moor.” 
Hangton smiled sourly. “A good 
idea, but a foolish one. You see, 
Sir ’Ubert, there’s a high moor 
above Middle Moor with the same 
kind of apron and if they got on 
that by mischance, they’d have to 
cross Middle Moor through the bogs 
and streams which would be good 
and high. But they wouldn’t make 
that kind of mistake.” 

The merchant-captains’ dean 

spoke up. “Aye, it’s too bad they’re 
coming from the land side, ’e could 
false-light em.” 

T he former clerk of the Lord 
High Admirals suddenly sensed 
an idea. 

“What’s this about false lighting,” 
he demanded sharply. 

The old captain explained: 



“Twenty year ago and for a hun- 
dred year afore that, ’ere was 
wreckers on this coast. The worst on 
’en were ’ee false lighters, used to 
light false beacons to trick coastal 
shipping into ’ee blind mouths on ’ee 
coast that looked like ’ee entrance 
to ’ee Ness. Oh, it were a sore 
thing. ’En killed all ’ee pour souls 
that swam ashore so that no one 
lived to peach on ’em. Today the 
coast patrol has stopped ’en bit a 
lot of us old salts know of ’en an 
’eir doin’s.” 

“Bigad, Captain, you’ve given me 
an idea! First of all, we’ll have to 
have some men who know the 
Moors like the old captain knows 
the coasts. General Hangton, do you 
think the moor trotters would meet 
that sort of bill?” 

“Stab me if it would be anyone 
but them. Don’t know why it is, 
but for a hundred miles in either 
direction they know all the paths 
through the moors and all then- 
twists and turnings. They’re a 
clannish lot, even have their own 
chief or king. They might help you 
and they might not. Simply no way 
to tell.” 

“Well said. General,” returned 
Sir Hubert, “but how can I find 
out? Where can I meet some of 
these moor trotters?” 

“Why, there’s always a few of 
them in jail for preaching. That’s 
another of their faults, they don’t 
give a fig for the game laws. And 
they die in jail. Can’t stand being 
shut within walls.” 

“Then we’ll free one of ’em and 
speak to this bog-trotting king of 
theirs.”

T he next fifty-two days were 
known as the rule of the mad 
Warden. He spent three days up 
on the apron of Middle Moor; he 
brought down an artist from the 
Navy chart office. The artist was 
also dispatched to the apron and 
given orders for night work on the 
Moors. 

Viscount Cockroftsbury - Stowe 
watched nervously as the indents 
for supplies ordered in by the Dep- 
uty Warden began to come across 
his desk. Five hundred thousand 
feet of quick match, six hundred 
diousand feet of oil deal gut, thirty 
thousand pieces of yellowish flam- 
ing slow-burning fuzees, twenty tons 
of pot-metal, broken down into two 
foot squares, ten thousand yards of 
heavy pre-waxed shoemaker’s twine 
and, strangest request of all, on an 
indent placed with the chimney 
cleaners’ guild of Lindesnes, three 
and a half tons of finely ground 
soot. 

He devoted a good deal of his 
remaining time to drilling — not 
drilling the militia (that was left in 
the capable hands of Colonel Fitz- 
william and Captain-Commodore 
Mountcourtenay) but rather drilling 
the townsfolk of Plymness in re- 
sponding to certain signals. Plymness 
being a Navy-oriented town, this 
was easier than it might have been 
elsewhere. 

On the late afternoon of the fifty- 
second day, the word came that the 
balloon armada was in the air. 

In Navy House, Fitzwilliam, 
Mountcourtenay and Wulf-Leigh sat 
uneasily around the big conference 
table. At the first semaphore-borne 



report, relayed from the Freunch 
coast, they had given orders to 
Hammington to rally his train- 
bands. The second message told of 
wind direction: east-southeast, but 
swinging easterly. 

“Looks bad for Lindesnes, Munk- 
ertny, if that wind makes any 
further easting,” growled Fitzwil- 
liam. 

“Aye,” snorted the captain. “But 
just in case there’s some north in 
that wind, I’m ordering the boats 
with the warden’s ruddy buckets. 
We’ll muddy up the Ness real well 
for you, Wilfly.” 

The second report relayed from 
the line o’ battle which backed the 
blockade line showed the aerial 
squadrons traveling on a wind mak- 
ing dead from the East. The fire- 
drakes of the line o’ battle drove the 
enemy into desperate ascents, but 
not before thirty-two of the fragile 
cloth bags had been wiped from the 
sky. 

The third report from the es- 
tuary which the great river flowed 
into below Lindesnes told of a 
shift to east-northeast. Five seconds 
after the semaphore message had 
been handed to the Deputy Warden 
he was in action. 

He gave a nod to Mountcourte- 
nay and that worthy went outside 
again. There was a drum roll and 
the shrilling in tempo of a half 
dozen bos’ns’ pipes signalled the 
boat crews to do their bit with the 
soot buckets. A word to the sexton 
of the town church and three bells 
were sounded from the spire. At 
this signal all the lights in the town 
were doused. Fitzwilliam, with two 



94 



IF 




companies of marines and a hun- 
dred and fifty seamen of the press 
gangs went out on a sweep to put 
out any lights that might still show. 

Twenty minutes later, the two 
members of the council reported 
back. “Not a light showing in all 
Plimness, Sir ’Ubert,” Fitzwilliam 
reported, 

Mountcourtenay announced, 
“We’ve dumped your three thousand 
pounds of chimney sweepings into 
the Ness and there isn’t a glimmer 
on the waters.” 

“All right, gentlemen, we have 
wiped out Plymness, at least to en- 
emy eyes. Now let us create new 
Plymness!” 

With these words, Wulf-Leigh 
went into the garden in the back 
of Navy House and cut away the 
sealed end of one of the oiled seal 
gut tubes that he had ordered and 
touched a glowing cigar to the cot- 
ton cord thefein contained. 

The spark whisked swiftly up the 
tube, suddenly branching and re- 
branching as it came to junctures 
with other tubes, so that the swift 
traveling sparks outlined for a few 
seconds the upper end of Plymness 
and then vanished as the lines of 
fire walked up onto Middle Moor. 

“Bigad, sir! So that’s what you 
did with that half million feet of 
quick-match that you ordered; and 
the seal gut kept it dry. But tell me, 
sir, what does that fuse light?” 

“To see that, Munkertny, we’ll 
have to go up to the stone apron of 
Middle Moor. It’s better seen than 
explained. I have horses waiting 
outside. Gentlemen shall we make 
the ascent? Colonel Fiswim, will you 



give orders to your Marines to 
march the same way? We’ll pick up 
Hangton and the militia on the 
way.” 

Through the gathering darkness, 
the little band of officers picked 
their way up the steep trail to Mid- 
dle Moor. They came to the top 
and collectively gasped. “Lorluwus!” 
exploded Mountcourtenay, “Plym- 
ness recreated! Even the Ness shim- 
mering at the foot of town and the 
light on Ness head. How’d you do 
it, Wilfly?” 

That last question hung in every- 
one’s lips and every man’s eyes as 
they gaped there in the slow-gather- 
ing darkness, watching the dimly 
burning lights of the town. Nearer 
to them they could see the lights 
reflect in the shimmering wavelets 
of a false Ness. 

“I had a good idea, but I couldn’t 
have carried it out without good 
helpers. The man from Navy Charts 
helped, and there were others. Here’s 
another of ’em.” 

A stout yet graceful swarthy skin- 
ned man materialized out of the 
darkness. He bowed to Sir Hubert. 
“I hope everything was to your loik- 
ing, zur.” 

“It was, Jovanko. Here — ” he 
threw him a heavy purse — “arc 
the thousand royals we agreed on. 
Gentlemen, we are visited by royal- 
ty. This is Jovanko the Tinker, king 
of the Moor Trotters. A genuine 
monarch too. Gets better obedience 
out of his people than King William, 
God bless him, gets out of his. His 
men, moving through mysteriously 
defined trails in the moor lands, 
planted the slow lights and the seal

IF • Short Story 



THE PEAK LORDS 

by MIRIAM ALLEN deFORD 



Tm nof o criminal! And even if 
I were, this punishment is too 
awful — exiled again to Mankind! 



Y ou may call this a confession 
if you wish. I prefer to call it 
a statement. 

In the first place, I want it clear- 
ly understood that I am the legiti- 
mate son of a Peak Lord. I am 
neither a by-blow nor an imposter. 
This outrageous skepticism has to 
cease. 

I acknowledge freely that I was 
vised Below on the date in question. 
But I was not there for any subver- 
sive reason whatever, nor was I 
there voluntarily. I deny emphati- 
cally that I have any compassion for 
the mutant dwellers Below, or that 
I was there in any endeavor to 
“help” or “incite” them. 

Moreover, I was not there out of 
the morbid curiosity which impels 
students to don breathers and un- 
dertake anthropological or sociolog- 
ical research Below. I have no in- 
terest in the subhumans living there. 

The actual fact is that I was 
kidnapped. 



It was horrible, there Below. The 
darkness — the stinking soup that 
passes there for air — the throngs of 
mutant subhumans mth ti»ir ground 
vehicles pouring yet more poison 
into the atmosphere that only they 
can breathe! And the streets full of 
crumbling, ruined buildings which 
they tear down periodically to make 
still more room for tiieir vehicles! 
Some superstition must keep the 
mutants from taking over what were 
once the homes of real human be- 
ings like us, for they huddle in 
crowded tenements like so many 
nests of rattlesnakes. 

I was so grateful when your 
people discovered me and took me 
out that I promised my rescuers rich 
rewards when I became Lord of our 
Peak. It was a dreadful shock to 
learn that they were not a salvage 
corps — my breather was almost ex- 
hausted and I had no recharges — 
but a police mission. I thought that 
all I should have to do would be 



97 



to explain to you how and why I 
was there, and you would protect 
me, let me live in your Lord’s court 
until I inherit. It is hard for me to 
believe that I am here as a prisoner, 
under judgment as a suspected crim- 
inal! 

Do you perhaps imagine that I 
am one of those throwbacks — there 
have been some, I know, even in 
Peak Lord families — who condemn 
our glorious system, who have de- 
fected to the Below and set them- 
selves up as champions of what they 
call “the oppressed”? Poor fools, 
how long could they last, unless they 
could find a quack doctor to give 
them the mutation operation (and 
often they have died from the doc- 
tor’s lack of skill), or else smuggle 
in recharges for their breathers? I 
am no such idiot. All of them have 
died and been hailed by their sub- 
human “brothers” as martyrs to 
their “cause” — all of them, that is, 
who haven’t been hauled back by 
their families in time and kept in 
close custody forever after. 

I have no such death wish, I can 
assure you, I want to live. 

Let me ask you another thing: 
how can you doubt, from the very 
mode of speech and manner which 
I cannot change or suppress even if 
I wanted to, that I am genuinely 
of a Peak Lord’s family? You your- 
selves are all Peak dwellers. Can’t 
you recognize my authority? I was 
born and reared in a royal house- 
hold, just as your own Peak Lord 
and his family were. The vicious 
slanders I have seen and heard about 
myself in your communication 
media call me “arrogant.” I say I 



keep the dignity taught me from in- 
fancy. Before whom should I be 
humble? There is no one on earth 
higher than the hundred or so Peak 
Lords and their families, dwelling 
as we do on the world’s highest 
mountain-tops, surrounded by re- 
tainers like yourselves who act as 
go-betweens to the mutants Below 
who serve the machines and pro- 
duce the wealth, for the Peak Lords 
who own their territories and re- 
ceive the wealth — and distribute a 
just portion of it to you. And I am 
a Peak Lord’s closest kin. 

M y father’s ancestors were among 
the first of the Peak Lords 
who staked out their claims when 
life gradually became unbearable in 
the poisoned cities, with their pol- 
luted air and water and their clouds 
of smog that shut out the sun. If 
you learned your history as children, 
you know that at first they were true 
pioneers, living the hard life of 
those who invade and transform a 
wilderness. They fought with others 
of their own breed to take and hold 
their Peaks, and they fought with 
the hordes from Below who tried to 
wrest the only unspoiled livable 
places on earth from those who had 
conquered them first. 

By tradition the first Peak Lords 
were all experienced mountaineers; 
I know my own Founding Father 
was. Others were astronauts who 
could not endure grounding after it 
was finally learned that the other 
planets of our solar system were 
dead or unborn and uninhabitable 
by men. Gradually, as they and their 
followers won their wars and con- 



98 



IF 




solidated their holdings, each Peak 
Lord built up a civilized community 
and established control over the con- 
quered Below in his own area. Then 
when the mutants appeared and 
spread — and don’t think that was an 
accident; it was scientific research 
paid for by the Peak Lords them- 
selves that brought about and 
evolved today’s race of subhumans 
whose means of living depends on 
their productivity for our benefit — 
our present political and economic 
chain of command was established. 

That is all elementary history, 
which you all learned in childhood. 

You all know that those con- 
demned to remain Below (and not 
only in the cities, as corruption 
spread to the countryside) died at 
first by the millions — and would 
all have died, had the Peak Lords 
not subsidized the intensive research 
projects — frankly, to protect their 
own sources of wealth. The dwellers 
Below had failed in all their own at- 
tempts to live underground or un- 
derseas, and they failed utterly in 
their feeble efforts to reconvert in- 
dustrial plants or the nature of their 
vehicles to end the pollution. Only 
the Peak Lords by that time posses- 
sed the huge fortunes required. 

Yes. Well, as I said, my father 
is descended from one of the very 
first Peak Lord families. Perhaps 
that is why, as so often happens in 
old families, he is an eccentric, 
strange, neurotic man. 1 should not 
dare say this if I were not out of 
his reach, for his anger is a terrible 
thing. 

He is a lone wolf, who has never 
fraternized with any of his peers. 



That is why, when you took my case 
to your own Peak Lord, he said he 
had never seen or heard of me. 

That is true. My father has never 
indulged in or allowed us — m;, 
mother and my younger brother: 
and sisters — any of the social visit 
ing back and forth in royal air 
processions which as you know arc 
the custom of other Peak Lords. 

He is a tyrant, and we have lec: 
miserable, lonely lives. He has never 
even tried to find us suitable wive'^ 
and husbands as we reached mar- 
riageable age. We are all unmarried, 
w>hen the last of us is dead the 
throne will go to a distant cousin 
He doesn’t care, so long as he can 
keep himself alive and in power. 

None of us has ever tried to es 
cape — for where would we escape 
to? No other Lord would take us in 
(short of the secret refuge I ask foi 
in my desperate situation), for fear 
of incurring my father’s rage and 
perhaps precipitating violent action 
which would end the Planet-wide 
Peace Pact that has endured now for 
two centuries. Instead, they have 
quarantined us, and I imagine the 
young members of other Peak Lord 
families do not even know that wc 
exist. Our Peak is far away, on the 
other side of the world. 

P erhaps you think, when I say 1 
was kidnapped, that I mean 1 
really did try to escape? 

No: in that case I should have 
chosen my destination, and it would 
not have been a Peak where nobody 
knows me and I am being treated 
as a common criminal. 

I think now I had been given

a connter-sedative to keep me from 
sleeping, while the servant who al- 
ways sleeps at the foot of my bed 
bad been given a draught to render 
liim unconscious. I had never before 
had trouble in sleeping, but this night 

is it only three nights ago? — I 
hiy wide awake until I couldn’t bear 
k any longer, so I got up. 

But when I tried to arouse my 
servant to help me dress I could not 
shake him from his deep slumber, so 
I arranged my own clothing as best 
I could. It was the first time in my 
Kfe that I had dressed without as- 
sistance — which may account for 
the accusation that I must be an 
imposter, because my clothing and 
ornaments are not arranged in regu- 
lation style. 

I had a great desire — almost a 
thirst — to walk out in the open air. 
It was a bright moonlight night — 
so bright that I imagined I could 
even see the beacon of the abandon- 
ed atomic station on the moon. 

Like all Peak castles, ours is a 
fortress too, still guarded regularly 
according to tradition although it is 
more than 100 years since any Peak 
Lord warred on another. I went 
quietly down the corridor leading 
from my rooms, to the first guarded 
door. Unusual as my action was, I 
knew that all I had to do was to 
explain to the guard that I wished 
to take a walk in the gardens, and 
to order him to provide an escort 
for me. 

The guard was asleep. 

It had never happened before, and 
I am sure now he too was drugged. 
He was liable to immediate execu- 
tion, but I had no intention of re- 



porting him. I stepped over his re- 
cumbent body and out into ttie tree- 
planted terrace. It was the first time 
I can remember that I have been 
completely alone. 

I walked slowly under the trees, 
breathing the fresh cool air, my eyes 
on the stars that we had hoped some 
day to reach and now know we 
never can. I wondered if on some 
planet around one of them some 
other unhappy young man was walk- 
ing and wondering as I was. 

And then suddenly — I had heard 
no sound — I was caught from be- 
hind, and before I could open my 
mouth to cry out I was blindfolded, 
gagged and bound with rope. There 
were two of them at least; I am 
sure of that. 

They dragged me over the garden 
to the outer gate. There too there 
should have been guards but no one 
stopped us. I was too busy trying 
to breathe to take much note, and 
when first I came back to my full 
senses I was lying, still bound, on a 
couch in a fast plane. 

Through my blindfold I felt the 
rays of the sun and realized it was 
morning, but I had no idea of our 
direction or of the distance we had 
flown. I could hear men talking and 
they spoke the local dialect of our 
Peak. They said nothing that helped 
me; their conversation, such as it 
was, was only of the weather and 
of flying conditions. 

Then I felt the plane swoop down 
for a landing. Hands unbound me, 
but left me gagged and blindfolded. 
I felt something clamped over my 
nose; I did n<k recognize it, but I 
found later it was a breather. The

IF 




plane taxied to a stop, I was pulled 
to my feet, the gag and blindfold 
were torn from me, and I was given 
a rough push that sent me to my 
knees. By the time I recovered my 
balance the plane had taken off 
again. 

I was Below. 

I t was some moments before my 
confusion enabled me to guess 
where I was. The sunshine of the 
upper air had vanished; I was in a 
sort of dingy twilight, and when I 
looked upward all I could see was 
an unbroken gray cloud. Through 
the breather I was able to inhale and 
exhale normally, but when experi- 
mentally I opened my mouth and 
breathed once through that, I was 
almost choked by the putrid miasma 
I took into my lungs. 

Ahead of me from the landing 
field stretched a paved road, beyond 
which I could see dimly streets and 
houses. There was nowhere to go 
but forward, so I stumbled on and 
in half an hour or so the city had 
swallowed me up. 

I need hardly tell you what it was 
like; you have vised it often, and 
you know. 

It was horrible. I stumbled around 
those congested streets for most of 
a day, trying to avoid contact with 
the creatures that swarmed there. I 
ate nothing — how could I eat their 
food? I had no money in any case, 
and I couldn’t understand or speak 
their dialect. They stared at me, but 
they’re trained not to approach real 
humans, who are certain to be agents 
of their Peak Lord. The occasional 
scientist investigating, or the cham- 



pions of the “oppressed,” will ap- 
proach them. 

I grew panicky. With every min- 
ute my breather was running out, 
and when it failed I had no re- 
charges or any means to get one. I 
would collapse and choke to death 
on one of those filthy streets. 

And then I heard the copter, and 
I knew I had been vised and would 
be rescued. I was weak with relief 
and gratitude. 

And your men told me I was 
under arrest. 

T T Thy won’t you believe me? My 
▼ ▼ father had me kidnapped and 
cast away Below to die. Why won’t 
you take me to your Peak Lord or 
one of his trusted aides and let me 
prove my identity. 

How do I know my father was 
to blame? Because I know my fa- 
ther. He hates us all — we are living 
reminders that some day he must 
give up his power and one of ns will 
inherit it. But he has always hated 
me most. I am the eldest, and his 
first heir. And before he cowed me 
into terror of him, I was the only 
one who rebelled, who dared to 
answer him back, to try — vainly, I 
acknowledge — to sneak away some- 
times for some sort of life of my 
own. You may say, what good would 
it do him to have me put out of 
the way? My oldest sister would 
come next, and there are five of us 
altogether. But that’s just the point 
— I am the scapegoat, and because 
I am not the only child I am ex- 
pendable. 

Besides, he doesn’t think the way 
sane people do. 



THE PEAK LORDS 



101 




So he decided to treat me as we 
treat our major criminals — I sup- 
pose you have the same system here 
— have me cast down Below to die. 

1 can’t help it: the mere thought 
of him — I tell you, judges, my fa- 
ther was a wicked evil old man! I 
hated him. He deserved what — 

Did I say “was”? I meant “is,” 
of course — 

I am too excited. I am weak still 
from my dreadful ordeal. 

.... No, I don’t believe you. You 
are trying to trick me. My sister is 
too intimidated to have sent you any 
such message. Let me see it. I have 
a right to see it. 

... I see. So all this time you have 
just been leading me on. 

All right. There’s no use keeping 
it up. 

I was not kidnapped. It was I 
myself who drugged the servants and 
the guards. I fled in one of our swift 
flyers after I had surprised my fa- 
ther in his sleep. I felled him with 
his own heavy staff of office, with 
which he had so often beaten me. 

I hid in your Below, as far away 
as i could travel, until you would 
vise me and bring me up, as any 
Peak Lord would do on vising a 
stranger without authorization in his 
Below. I threw away my recharges 
when I heard your copter start down 
for me. If I had dreamed what a 
Below was like I would never have 
had the courage to carry out my 
plan. 

But I am not a criminal! It was 
not murder to destroy a tyrant! He 
deserved to die. 

My sister is an ingrate. No, of 
course I never confided in her. But 



I relied on her; I was sure she would 
rejoice as I did when at last I mus- 
tered the courage to do what we all 
must have longed for — that she 
would gladly serve as Peak Lady 
until it was safe for me to declare, 
myself and return. I would have 
named her as my successor. 

Very well: let me go now. This 
is no concern of yours. I shall fly 
home again and take over from her. 

N o, you can’t, you can’t! There is 
no treaty between our Peaks. 
The most you have a right to do is 
to keep me as a guest of your Lord 
while he investigates! You will find 
out then that I am no murdered: I 
am a righteous executioner. 

Take me before him and let me 
present my cause to my equal. What 
have I to do with your local laws? 

. Sir! I did not realize! My 
father would never have sat in judg- 
ment in person at a criminal hear- 
ing — 

No! No! I beg of you! I know 
your word is supreme in your juris- 
diction, my Lord, and I know I en- 
tered it of my own volition. But — 
Oh, dear God, no! Not without 
even a breather! 

Kill me in any other way and I 
shall accept your judgment with the 
dignity worthy of my blood. But I 
implore you, my Lord, anything, 
anything — but not that dreadful 
city of mutants again! 

Not — not — B

T he older man was being hustled 
along by the stilyagi kids. He 
was mussed, and clothing had that 
vague something that says “tourist.” 
We used to get tourists even then. 
Not hordes but quite a few. They 
would come up from Earth, stop in 
a hotel for a week, go back in same 
ship or perhaps stop over for next 
ship. Most of them spent their time 
gambling after a day or two of sight- 
seeing including that silly walk up 
on surface every tourist makes. Most 
Loonies ignored them and granted 
them their foibles. 

One lad, oldest, about eighteen 
and leader, said to me, “Where’s 
judge?” 

“Don’t know. Not here.” 

He chewed lip, looked baffled. I 
said, “What trouble?”

What Has Gone Before — 



We Lunarians have put up with a lot from Earth, but time comes 
when we don't want to put up with more. Earth tells us vrhat we can 
sell, who we sell It to, how much we can get for it. Means slavery. 

But . Earth owns us outright. Question is, what can we do 
about it? I don't mind a gamble — ^wouldn't mind fighting Eorth with 
a chance to win — but with no chance, no. Luna has no warships. 
Earth has plenty. Luna has no armies. Earth has armies to burn. 

Most of all, Luna is run by big computer, and Earth owns the 
computer. 

But there's one thing Earth doesn't own — me. And it just so 
happens that I'm the fellow that fixes the computer . and the 
computer is my good friend I call Mike! 

So maybe — just maybe — we Lunarians can do something at last. 

/ 

So we invent mythical leader named "Adam Selene" — is really 
Mike — and start rolling. Only one problem: Need help on Earth. 
That's the hard one, because earthworms I don't know, neither does 
Mike, neither does any good Loonie. Don't know where to look . 
until chance delivers one into hands, when group of stilyagi kids ask 
to kill himl 



He said soberly, “Going to elimi- 
nate this ohoom. But want Judge to 
confirm it.” 

I said, “Cover taprooms here 
around. Probably find him. 

A boy about fourteen spoke up. 
“Say! Aren’t you Gospodin O’Kel- 
ly?” 

“Right.” 

“Why don’t you judge it?” 

Oldest one looked relieved. “Will 
you, Gospodin?” 

I hesitated. Sure, I’ve gone judge 
at times; who hasn’t? But don’t han- 
ker for responsibility. However it 



troubled me to hear young peoirfe 
talk about eliminating a tourist 
Bound to cause talk. 

Decided to do it. So I said to 
tourist, “Will you accept me as your 
judge?” 

He looked surprised. “I have 
choice in the matter?” 

I said patiently, “Of course. CanH 
expect me to listen if you aren’t 
willing to accept my judging. Birt 
not urging you. Your life, not mine.” 
He looked very surprised but not 
afraid. His eyes lit up. “My life, did 
you say?”

“Apparently. You heard lads say 
they intend to eliminate you. You 
may prefer to wait for Judge Brody.” 

He didn’t hesitate. Shailed and 
said, “I accept you as my judge, 
sir.” 

“As you wish.” I looked at oldest 
lad. “WTiat parties to quarrel? Just 
you and your young friend?” 

“Oh, no. Judge, all of us.” 

“Not your judge yet.” I looked 
around. “Do you all ask me to 
judge?” 

Were nods; none said No. Leader 
turned to giii, added, “Better speak 
up, Tish. You accept Judge O’Kel- 
ly?” 

“What? Oti, sure!” She was a va- 
pid little dung, vacantly pretty, cur- 
vy, perhaps fourteen. Sot-machine 
type . and how she might wind 
up. Sort who prefers being queen 
over pack of stilyagi to solid mar- 
riage. I donH Marne stByagi; they 
chase around corridors because not 
enough females. Work all day and 
nothing to go home to at night. 

“Okay, ooort has been accepted 
and all are bound to abide by my 
verdict. Left settle fees. How high 
can you boys go? Please understand 
Fm not gc»ng to judge an elimina- 
tion for dimes. So ante up or I turn 
him loose.** 

L eader Minked, they went into 
huddle. S3M)rtly he turned and 
said, “We d«m*t have much. Will you 
do it for five Kong dollars apiece?” 
Six of them. “No. Ought not to 
ask a court to judge elimination at 
that price.** 

They huddled again. “P^y dol- 
lars, Judge?** 



“JSxty. Ten eadi. And anothw 
ten from you, Tish,” I said to girl. 

Sie looked surprised, indignant. 
“Come, come!” I said. “Tanstaafl.” 

She blinked and reached into 
pouch. She had money; types like 
that always have. 

I collected seventy dollars, laid it 
on desk, and said to tourist, “Can 
match it?” 

“Beg pardon?” 

“Kids are paying seventy dollan 
Hong Kong for judgment. You 
should match it. If you can’t open 
p<mch and prove it and can owe it 
to me. But that’s your share.” I 
added, “Cheap, for a capital case. 
But kids can’t pay much so you get 
a bargain.” 

“I see. I believe I see.” He match- 
ed witii seventy Hong Kong. 

“Thank you,” I said. “Now doee 
dthcr side want a jury?” 

Girl’s eyes lit up. “Sure! Let’s do 
it right.” 

Earthworm said, “Under the <»■ 
GiKnstances perhaps I need one.” 

“Can have it,” I assured. “Waat 
a counsel?” 

“I suppose I need a lawyer, too.** 

“I said ‘counsd,’ not lawyer.* 
Aren’t any lawyers here.” 

Agam he seemed delighted. *1 
suppose counsel, if I elected to have 
one, would be of the same, idi. In- 
formal quality as the rest of them 
proceedings?” 

“Maybe, ma]d>e mot Fm infcMmud 
sort of judge, diafs afi. Suit your- 
self.” 

“Mmm. I think FH rely on your 
informality, your honor." 

Oldest lad said, “Uh, this jury. 
You pick up chit? Or do we?”

“I pay it; I agreed to judge for 
a hundred forty, gross. Haven’t you 
been in a court before? But not 
going to kill my net for extra I could 
do without. Six jurymen, five dollars 
each. See who’s in Alley.” 

One boy stepped out and shouted, 
”Jury work! Five-dollar job!” 

They rounded up six men and 
were what you would expect in Bot- 
tom Alley. Didn’t worry me as had 
no intention of paying mind to them. 
If you go judge, better in good 
neighborhood with chance of get- 
ting solid citizens. 

I went behind desk, sat down, put 
on Brody’s plug hat — wondered 
where he had found it. Probably a 
cast-off from some lodge. “Court’s 
in session,” I said. “Let’s have 
names and tell me beef.” 

Oldest lad was named Slim Lem- 
ke, girl was Patricia Carmen Zhu- 
kov; don’t remember others. Tour- 
ist stepped up, reached into poudi 
and said, “My card, sir.” 

I still have it. It read: 

Stuart Rene LaJoie 
Poet - Traveler - Soldier of Fortune 

B eef was tragically ridiculous, 
fine example of why tourists 
should not wander around without 
guides. Sure, guides bleed them 
white — but isn’t that what a tour- 
ist is for? This one almost lost life 
from lack of guidance. 

Had wandered into a taproom 
which lets stilyagi hang out, a sort 
of clubroom. This simple female had 
flirted with him. Boys had let matter 
be, as of course they had to as long 
as she invited it. But at some point 

1BE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



she had laughed and let him have 
a fist in ribs. He had taken it as 
casually as a Loonie would ... but 
had answered in distinctly earth- 
worm manner. He slipped arm 
around waist and pulled her to him, 
apparently tried to kiss her. 

Now believe me, in North Ameri- 
ca this wouldn’t matter; I’ve seen 
things much like it. But of course 
Tish was astonished, perhaps fright- 
ened. She screamed. 

And pack of boys set upon him 
and roughed him up. Then decided 
he had to pay for his “crime” — but 
do it correctly. Find a judge. 

Most likely they chickened. 
Chances are not one had ever dealt 
with an elimination. But their lady 
had been insulted, had to be done. 

I questioned them, especially 
Tish, and decided I had it straight. 
Then said, “Let me sum up. Here 
we have a stranger. Doesn’t know 
our ways. He offended, he’s guilty. 
But meant no offense far as I can 
see. What does jury say? Hey, you 
there — wake up! What you say?” 
Juryman looked up blearily, said, 
“ ’Liminate him!” 

“Very well? And you?” 

“WeB — ” Next one hesitated. 
“Guess it would be enough just to 
beat tar out of him, so he’ll know 
better next time. Can^t have men 
pawing wmnen. Place will get to be 
as bad as Terra.” 

“Sensible,” I agreed. “And you?” 
Only one juror voted for elimina- 
tion. Others ranged from a beating 
to very high fines. 

“What do you think. Slim?” 
“Well — ” He was worried — face 
in front of gang, face in front of 

107 




what might be his giil. But had 
cooled down and didn’t want dium 
eliminated. “We already worked him 
over. Maybe if he got down on 
hands and knees and kissed floor in 
front of Tish and said he was sorry?” 
“Will you do that, Gospodin La- 
Joie?” 

“If you 90 rule, your honor.” 

“I donH. Here’s my verdict. First, 
that juryman — you! You are fined 
fee paid you because you fell 
asleep while supposed to be judging. 
Grab him, boys, take it away from 
him and Arow him out.” 

r iey did, enthusiastically; made 
up a little for greater excite- 
ment they had thought of but really 
could not stomach. “Now, Gospodin 
LaJoie, you are fined fifty Hong 
Kong for not having common sense 
to learn local customs before stirring 
around. Ante up.” 

I collected it. “Now you boys 
line up. You are fined five dollars 
apiece for not exercising good judg- 
ment in dealing with a person you 
knew was a stranger and not used to 
our ways. Stopping him from touch- 
ing Tish, that’s fine. Roughing him, 
that’s okay, too; he’ll learn faster. 
And could have tossed him out. But 
talking about eliminating for what 
was honest mistake — well, it’s out 
of proportion. Five bucks each. Ante 
up.” 

Slim gulped. “Judge ... I don’t 
think we have that much left! At 
least I don’t.” 

“I thought that might be. You 
have a week to pay, or I post your 
names in Old Dome. Know where 
Bon Ton Beaute Shoppe is, near 



easement lock thirteen? My wife 
runs it; pay her. Court’s out. Slim, 
don’t go away. Nor you, Tish. Gos- 
podin LaJoie, let’s take these young 
people up and buy them a cold drink 
and get better acquainted.” 

Again his eyes filled with odd de- 
light that reminded of Prof. “A 
charming idea, Judge!” 

“I’m no longer judge. It’s up a 
couple of ramps ... so I suggest 
you offer Tish your arm.” 

He bowed and said, “My lady? 
May I?” and crooked his elbow to 
her. Tish at once became very 
grown up. “Spasebo, Gospodin! I 
am pleased.” 

Took them to expensive place, one 
where their wild clothes and exces- 
sive makeup looked out of place; 
they were edgy. But I tried to make 
them feel easy and Stuart LaJoie 
tried even harder and successfidly. 
Got fiieir addresses as well as names; 
Wyoh had one sequence which was 
concentrating on stilyagi. Presently 
they fini^ed their coolers, stood up, 
thanked and left. LaJoie and I stay- 
ed on. 

“Gospodin,” he said presently, 
“you used an odd word earlier — 
odd to me, I mean.” 

“CaB me ‘Mannie’ now tiliat kids 
are gone.. What word?” 

“It was when you insisted that 
the, rrfi, young lady, Tish — that 
Tish must pay, too. ‘Tone-stapple,’ 
or something like it.” 

“CMi, ‘tanstaafl.’ Means ‘There 
ain’t no such thing as a free lunch.’ 
And isn’t,” I added, pointing to a 
FREE LUNCH sign across room, 
“or these drinks would cost half 
as much. Was reminding her that 



108 



IP 




anydiing free costs twice as much in 
long run or turns out worthless.” 
‘‘An interesting pihilosophy.” 

‘‘Not philosophy, fact. One way 
or oilier, what you get, you pay 
for.” I fanned air. “Was Earthside 
once and heard expression ‘Free as 
air.* This air isn’t free, you pay for 
every breath.” 

“Really? No one has asked me to 
pay to breathe.” He smiled. “Per- 
haps I should stop.” 

“Can happen, you almost breath- 
ed vacuum tonight. But nobody asks 
you because you’ve paid. For you, 
is part of roundtrip ticket; for me 
it’s a quarterly charge.” I started to 
tefl how my family buys and sells 
air to community co-op, decided was 
too complicated. “But we both pay.” 

L aJoie looked thoughtfully pleas- 
ed. “Yes, I see the economic 
necessity. It’s simply new to me. Tell 
me, uh, Mannie — and I’m called 
‘Stu’ — was I really in danger of 
‘breathing vacuum’?” 

“Should have charged you more.” 
“Please?” 

“You aren’t convinced. But charg- 
ed kids all they could scrape up and 
fined them too, to make them think. 
Couldn’t charge you more than them. 
Should have, you think it was all a 
joke.” 

“Believe me, sir, I do not think 
it was a joke. I just have trouble 
grasping that your local laws permit 
a man to be put to death ... so 
casually . and for so trivial an 
offense.” 

I sighed. Where do you start ex- 
plaining when a man’s words show 
there isn’t anything he understands 



about subject, instead is loaded with 
preconceptions diat don’t fit facts 
and doesn’t even know he has? 

“Stu,” I said, “let’s take that piece 
at a time. Are no ‘local laws’ so 
you couldn’t be ‘put to death’ under 
them. Your offense was not ‘trivial,’ 
I simply made allowance for ignor- 
ance. And wasn’t done casually, or 
boys would have dragged you to 
nearest lock to zero pressure, shoved 
you in and cycled. Instead were 
most formal — good boys! — and 
paid own cash to give you a trial. 
And didn’t grumble when verdict 
wasn’t even close to what they ask- 
ed. Now, anything still not clear?” 

He grinned and turned out to have 
dimples like Prof; found myself lik- 
ing him still more. “All of k, Fai 
afraid. I seem to have wandered i^o 
Looking Glass Land.” 

Expected that; having been Eardir 
side I know how their minds work, 
some. An earthworm expects to find 
a printed law for every circum- 
stance. Even have laws for privale 
matters such as contracts. Re^ly. If 
a man’s word isn’t any good, who 
would contract with him? Doesn’t 
he have reputation? 

“We don’t have laws,” I said, 
“Never been allowed to. Have cus- 
toms, but aren’t written and aren’t 
enforced — or could say they are 
self-enforcing because are simply 
way things have to be, conditions 
being what they are. Could say our 
customs are natural laws because 
are way people have to behave to 
stay alive. \^en you made a pass 
at Tisih you were violating a natural 
law . and almost caused you to 
breathe vacuum.” 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



109 




He bHnkcd thoughtfully. “Would 
you explain tibe natural law I violat- 
ed? I had better understand it . 
or best I return to my ship and stay 
inboard until lift. To stay alive.” 
“Certainly. Is so simple that, once 
you understand, you’ll never be in 
danger from it again. Here we are, 
two million males, less than one mil- 
lion females. A physical fact, basic 
as rock or vacuum. Then add idea 
of tanstaafl. When thing is scarce, 
price goes up. Women are scarce; 
aren’t enou^ to go around — that 
makes them most valuable thing in 
Luna, more precious than ice or 
air, as men without women don’t 
care whether they stay alive or not. 
Except a Cyborg, if you regard him 
as a man, wbmh I don’t.” 

I went on: “So what happens? — 
and mind you, things were even 
worse when this custom, or natural 
law, first showed itself back in 
twentieth century. Ratio was ten- 
to-one or worse then. One thing is 
what always happens in prisons; men 
turn to other men. That helps not 
much; problem still is because most 
men want women and won’t settle 
for substitute while chance of getting 
true gelt. 

“They get so anxious they will kill 
for it . and from stories old-timers 
tell was killing enough to chill your 
teeth in those days. But after a while 
those stifl alive find way to get along, 
tilings shake down. As automatic as 
gravitation. Those who adjust to 
facts stay alive; those who don’t are 
dead and no problem. 

“What that means, here and now, 
is that women are scarce and call 



tune . and you are surrounded 
by two million men who see to it 
you dance to that tune. You have no 
choice, she has all choice. She can 
hit you so hard it draws blood; you 
dasn’t lay a finger on her. Look, 
you put an arm around Tish, maybe 
you tried to kiss. Suppose instead 
she had gone to hotel room with 
you. What would happen?” 

“Heavens! I suppose they would 
have torn me to pieces.” 

“They would have done nothing. 
Shrugged and pretended not to see. 
Because choice is hers. Not yours. 
Not theirs. Exclusively hers. Oh, be 
risky to ask her to go to hotel; she 
might take offense and that would 
give boys license to rough you up. 
But — well, take this Tish. A silly 
little tart. If you had flashed as much 
mioney as I saw in your pouch, she 
might have taken into head that a 
bundle with tourist was just what 
she needed and suggested it herself. 
In which case would have been ut- 
terly safe.” 

L^oie shivered. “At her age? It 
scares me to think of it. She’s below 
the age of consent. Statutory rape.” 

“Oh, bloody! No such thing. 
Women her age are married or ought 
to be. Stu, is no rape in Luna. None. 
Men won’t permit. If rape had been 
involved, they wouldn’t have both- 
ered to find a judge and all men in 
earshot would have scrambled to 
help. But chance that a girl that big 
is virgin is negligible. When they’re 
little, their mothers watch over 
them, with help from everybody in 
city. Children are safe here. But 
when they reach husband-high, is no 
holding them and mothers quit try- 



11 « 



IF 




ing. If they choose to run corridors 
and have fun, can’t stop ’em; once 
a girl is nubile, she’s her own boss. 
You married?” 

“No.” He added with a smile, 
“Not at present.” 

“Suppose you were and wife told 
you she was marrying again. What 
would you do?” 

“Odd that you should pick that, 
something like it did happen. I saw 
my attorney and made sure that she 
got no alimony.” 

“‘Alimony’ isn’t a word here; I 
learned it Earthside. Here you 
might — or a Loonie husband might 
— say, ‘I think we’ll need a bigger 
place, dear.’ Or might simply con- 
gratulate her and his new co-hus- 
band. Or if it made him so unhappy 
he couldn’t stand it, might opt out 
and pack clothes. But whatever, 
would not make slightest fuss. If he 
did, opinion would be unanimous 
against him. His friends, men and 
women alike, would snub him. Poor 
sod would probably move to Novy- 
len, change name and hope to live 
it down. 

“All our customs work that way. 
If you’re out in field and a cobber 
needs air, you lend him a bottle and 
don’t ask cash. But when you’re 
both back in pressure again, if he 
won’t pay up, nobody would criti- 
cize if you eliminated him without 
a judge. But he would pay. Air is 
almost as sacred as women. If you 
take a new chum in a poker game, 
you give him air money. Not eating 
money; can work or starve. If you 
eliminate a man other than self- 
defense, you pay his debts and sup- 
port his kids.” 



44TV ^annie, you’re telling me that 
d-VA I can murder a man here 
and settle the matter merely with 
money?” 

“Oh, not at all! But eliminating 
isn’t against some law; are no laws 
— except Warden’s regulations — 
and Warden doesn’t care what one 
Loonie does to another. But we fig- 
ure this way: If a man is killed, 
either he had it coming and every- 
body knows it — usual case — or his 
friends will take care of it by elimi- 
nating man who did it. Either way, 
no problem. Nor many eliminations. 
Even set duels aren’t common.” 

“ ‘His friends will take care of it.* 
Mannie, suppose those young people 
had gone ahead? I have no ^ends 
here.” 

“Was reason I agreed to- judge. 
While I doubt if those kids could 
have egged each other into it, didn’t 
want to take chance. Eliminating a 
tourist could give our city a bad 
name.” 

“Does it happen often?” 

“Can’t recall has ever happened. 
Of course may have been made to 
look like accident. A new chum is 
accident-prone; Luna is that sort of 
place. They say if a new chum lives 
a year, he’ll live forever. But no- 
body sells him insurance first year.** 
Glanced at time. “Stu, have you 
had dinner?” 

“No, and I was about to suggest 
that you come to my hotel. The 
cooking is good. Auberge Orleans.** 
I repressed shudder — ate there 
once. “Instead, would you come 
home with me and meet my family? 
We have soup or something about 
this hour.”

*Tsn’t that an imposition?” 

“No. Half a minute while 1 
phone.” 

Mum said, “Manuel! How sweet, 
dear! Capsule has been in for hours; 
I had decided it would be tomorrow 
or later.” 

“Just drunken debauchery, Mimi, 
and evil companions. Coming home 
now if can remember way — and 
bringing evil companion.” 

“Yes, dear. Dinner in twenty min- 
utes; try not to be late.” 

“Don’t you want to know wibether 
my evil companion is male or fe- 
male?” 

“Knowing you, I assume that it is 
female. But I fancy I shall be able 
to tell when I see her.” 

“You know me so well. Mum. 
Warn girls to look pretty; wouldn’t 
want a visitor to outshine them.” 
“Don’t be too long; dinner will 
spoil. ’Bye, dear. Love.” 

“Love, Mum.” I waited, then 
punched MYCROFTXXX. “Mike, 
want a name searched. Earthside 
name, passenger in Popov. Stuart 
Rene LaJoie. Stuart with a U and 
last name might file under either 
L or J.” 

Didn’t wait many seconds; Mike 
found Stu in all major Earthside 
references: Who’s Who, Dunn & 
Bradstreet, Almanach de Godia, 
London Times running files, name 
it. Frendh expatriate, royalist, 
wealthy, six more names sandwiched 
into ones he used, Aree university 
degrees including one in law from 
Sorbonne, noble ancestry boA 
France and Scotland, divorced (no 
children) from Honorable Pamela 
Hyphen-Hyphen-Blueblood. Sort erf 



earthworm who wouldn’t speak to a 
Loonie of convict ancestry — except 
Stu would speak to anyone. 

I listened a pair of minutes then 
asked Mike to prepare a full 
dossier, following all associations! 
leads. “Mike, might be our pigeon.” 
“Could be, Man.” 

“Got to run. ’Bye.” Returned 
thoughtfully to my guest. Almost a 
year earlier, during alcoholic talk- 
talk in a hotel room, Mike had 
promised us one chance in seven — 
if certain things were done. One sine- 
qua-non was help on Terra itself. 

Despite “throwing rocks”, Mike 
knew, we all knew, that mighty Ter- 
ra with eleven billion people and 
endless resources could not be de- 
feated by three million who had 
nothing, even though we stood on a 
high place and could drop rocks on 
them. 

Mike drew parallels from XVIIIth 
century, when Britain’s American 
colonies broke away, and from 
XXth, when many colonies became 
independent of several empires, and 
pointed out that in no case had a 
colony broken loose by brute force. 
No, in every case imperial state was 
busy elsewhere, had grown weary 
and given up without using full 
strength. 

For months we had been strong 
enough, had we wished, to overcome 
Warden’s bodyguards. Once our cat- 
apult was ready (any time now) we 
would not be helpless. But we needed 
a “favorable climate” on Terra. For 
that we needed help on Terra. 

Prof had not regarded it as diffi- 
cult. But turned out to be quite 



112 



IF 




<ii££icult His Earlhside friends were 
dead or neaily, and I bad never had 
mj bnt a few teachers. We sent 
inquky down through cells: “What 
vi{K do you know Earthside?*’ and 
usual answer was: “You kidding?” 
Null program. 

Prof watched passengw lists on 
incoming ships, ^ing to figure a 
contact, and had been reading Luna 
print-outs of Earthside newspapers, 
searching for vips he could reach 
through past connection. I had not 
tried; handful I had met on Terra 
were not vips. 

Prof had not picked Stu off 
Popov’s passenger list. But Prof had 
not met him. I did not know whether 
Stu was simply eccentric as odd per- 
sonal card seemed to show. But he 
was only Terran I had ever had a 
drink with in Luna, seemed a dink- 
um cobber, and Mike’s report show- 
ed hunch was not all bad. He carried 
some tonnage. 

So I took him home to see what 
family thought of him. 

Started well. Mum smiled and of- 
fered hand. He took it and bowed so 
deep I thought he was going to kiss 
it — would have, I think, had I not 
warned him about ferns. Mum was 
cooing as she led him in to dinner. 

XXI 

A pril and May were more hard 
work and increasing effort to 
stir up Loonies against Warden, and 
goad him into retaliation. 

Trouble with Mort the Wart was 
that he was not a bad egg. Nothing 
to hate about him other than fact 
he was symbol of Authority. Was 



necessary to frighten him to gel him 
to do anything. 

And average Loonie was just as 
bad. He despised Warden as matter 
of ritual but was not stuff that makes 
revolutionists; he couldn’t be both- 
ered. Beer, betting, women and 
work- Only diing that kept Revolu- 
tion from dying of anemia was that 
Peace Dragoons had real talent for 
antagonizing. 

But even them we had to keep 
stirred up. Prof kept saying we need- 
ed a “Boston Tea Party,” referring 
to mythical incide^ in an earlier 
revolution, by whidi he meant a 
public ruckus to grab attention. 

We kept trying. Mike rewrote 
lyrics of old revcrfutionary songs: 
’’Marseillaise,” ’’Internationale,” 
’’Yankee Doodle,” ”We Shall Over- 
come,” ”Pie in the Sky,” etc., giving 
them words to fit Luna. Stuff like 
"Sons of Rock and Boredom/ Will 
you let the Warden/Take from you 
your libertee!” Simon Jester spread 
them around, and when one took 
hold, we pushed it {music only) by 
radio and video. This put Warden 
in silly position of forbidding play- 
ing of certain tunes. Which suited 
us. People could whistle. 

Mike studied voice and word- 
choice patterns of Deputy Adminis- 
trator, Chief Engineer, other depart- 
ment heads; Warden started getting 
frantic calls at night from his staff. 
Which they denied making. So Al- 
varez put lock-and-trace on nex^ one 
— and sure enough, with Mike’s 
help, Alvarez traced it to supply 
chiefs phone and was sure it was 
boss belly-robber’s voice. 

But next poison call to Mort seem-

ed to come from Alvarez, and what 
Mort had to say next day to Alvarez 
and what Alvarez said in own de- 
fense can only be described as chao- 
tic crossed with psychotic. 

Prof had Mike stop. Was afraid 
Alvarez might lose job, which we 
did not want; he was doing too well 
for us. But by then Peace Dragoons 
had been dragged out twice in night 
on what seemed to be Warden’s or- 
ders, further disrupting morale, and 
Warden became convinced he was 
surrounded by traitors in official 
family while they were sure he had 
blown every circuit. 

An ad appeared in Lunaya Pravda 
announcing lectiu'e by Dr. Adam 
Selene on Poetry and Arts in Luna: 
a New Renaissance. No comrade 
attended; word went down cells to 
stay away. Nor did anybody hang 
around when three squads of Peace 
Dragoons showed up — this involves 
Heisenberg principle as applied to 
Scarlet Pimpernels. Editor of Pravda 
spent bad hour explaining that he 
did not accept ads in person and this 
one was ordered over counter and 
paid for in cash. He was told not 
to take ads from Adam Selene. This 
was countermanded and he was told 
to take anything from Adam Selene 
but notify Alvarez at once. 

New catapult was tested with a 
load dropped into south Indian 
Ocean at 35®E., 60°S., a spot used 
only by fish. Mike was joyed over 
his marksmanship since he had been 
able to sneak only two looks when 
guidance & tracking radars were not 
in use and had relied on just one 
nudge to bring it to bullseye. Earth- 
side news reported giant meteor in 



sub-Antarctic picked up by Cape- 
town Spacetrack with projected im- 
pact that matched Mike’s attempt 
I>erfectly. Mike called me to boast 
while taking down evening’s Reuters 
transmission. “I told you it was dead 
on,” he gloated. “I watched it. Oh, 
what a lovely splash!” Later reports 
on shock wave from seismic labs and 
on tsunamis from oceanographic sta- 
tions were consistent. 

Was only canister we had ready 
(trouble buying steel) or Mike 
might have demanded to try his new 
toy again. 

L iberty caps started appearing on 
stilyagi and their girls; Simon 
Jester began wearing one between 
his horns. Bon Marche gave them 
away as premiums. Alvarez had pain- 
ful talk with Warden in which Mort 
demanded to know if his fink boss 
felt that something should be done 
every time kids took up fad? Had 
Alvarez gone out of his mind? 

I ran across Slim Lemke on Car- 
ver Causeway early May; he was 
wearing a Liberty Cap. He seemed 
pleased to see me and I thanked him 
for prompt payment (he had come 
in three days after Stu’s trial and 
paid Sidris thirty Hong Kong, for 
gang) and bought him a cooler. 
While we were seated I asked why 
young people were wearing red hats? 
Why a hat? Hats were an earthworm 
custom, nyet? 

He hesitated, then said was a sort 
of a lodge, like Elks. 

I changed subject. Learned that 
his full name was Moses Lemke 
Stone; member of Stone Gang. This 
pleased me, we were relatives. But 



114 



IF 




surprised me. However even best 
families sudh as Stones sometimes 
can’t always find marriages fw aD 
sons; I bad been lucky or might 
have been roving corridors at his 
age, too. Told him about our con- 
nection on my mother’s side. 

He warmed up and shortly said, 
“Cousin Manuel, ever think about 
how we ought to elect our own War- 
den?” 

I said No, I hadn’t; Authority ap- 
pointed him and I supposed they 
always would. He asked me why we 
had to have an Authority? I asked 
who had been putting ideas in head? 
He insisted nobody had, just think- 
ing, was all — didn’t he have a right 
to think? 

When I got home was tempted to 
check with Mike, find out lad’s 
Party name if any. But wouldn’t 
have been proper security, nor fair 
to Slim. 

On 3 May ’76 seventy-one males 
named Simon were rounded up and 
questioned, then released. No news- 
paper carried story. But everybody 
heard it; we were clear down in 
“Ts” and twelve thousand people 
can spread a story faster than I 
would have guessed. We emphasized 
that one of these dangerous males 
was only four years old, which was 
not true but very effective. 

S tu LaJoie stayed with us during 
February and March and did 
not return to Terra until early April; 
he changed his ticket to next ship 
and then to next. When I pointed 
out that he was riding close to in- 
visible line where irreversible phy- 
siological changes could set in, he 

THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



grinned and told me not to worry. 
But made arrangements to use cen- 
trifuge. 

Stu did not want to leave even 
by April. Was kissed good-bye with 
tears by all my wives and Wyoh, and 
he assured each one he was coming 
back. But left as he had work to do; 
by then he was a Party member. 

I did not take part in decision to 
recruit Stu; I felt prejudiced. Wyoh 
and Mike were unanimoiK in risldng 
it. I happily accepted their judg- 
ment. 

We all helped to sell Stu LaJoie — 
self. Prof, Mike, Wyoh, Mum, even 
Sidris and Lenore and Ludmilla and 
our kids and Hans and Ali and 
Frank, as Davis home life was what 
grabbed him first. Did not hurt that 
Lenore was prettiest girl in L-City 
— which is no disparagement of 
Milla, Wyoh, Anna and Sidris. Nor 
did it hurt that Stu could charm a 
baby away from breast. Mum fussed 
over him, Hans showed him hydro- 
ponic farming and Stu got dirty and 
sweaty and sloshed around in tun- 
nels with our boys. Helped harvest 
our Chinee fish ponds — got stung 
by our bees — learned to handle a 
p-suit and went up with me to make 
adjustments on solar battery — help- 
ed Anna butcher a hog and learned 
about tanning leather — sat with 
Grandpaw and was respectful to his 
naive notions about Terra — washed 
dishes with Milla, something no male 
in our family ever did — rolled on 
floor with babies and puppies — 
learned to grind flour and swapped 
recipes with Mum. 

I introduced him to Prof and that 
started political side of feeling him 

111 




out. Nothing had been admitted — 
we could back away — when Prof 
ioCroduced him to “Adam Selene” 
who could visit only by phone as 
he was “in Hong Kong at present.” 
By time Stu was committed to Cause, 
we dropped pretense and let him 
know that “Adam” was chairman 
whom he would not meet in person 
for security reasons. 

But Wyoh did most and was on 
her judgment that Prof turned cards 
up and let Stu know that we were 
building a revolution. Was no sur- 
prise; Stu had made up mind and 
was waiting for us to trust him. 

They say a face once launched a 
thousand ships. I do not know that 
Wyoh used anything but argument 
on Stu. I never tried to find out. 
But Wyoh had more to do with 
committing me than all Profs theory 
or Mike’s figures. If Wyoh used 
strong methods on Stu, she was not 
first heroine in history to do so for 
her country. 

Stu went Earthside with a special 
codebook. I’m no code and cipher 
expert except that a computerman 
learns principles during study of in- 
formation theory. A cipher is a 
mathematical pattern under which 
one letter substitutes for another, 
simplest being one in which alpha- 
bet is merely scrambled. 

A cipher can be incredibly subtle, 
especially with help of a computer. 
But ciphers all have weakness that 
they are patterns. If one computer 
can think them up, another comput- 
er can break them. 

Codes do not have same weak- 
ness. Let’s say that code book has 
letter groups GLOPS. Does this 



mean “/;unt Minnie will be home 
Thursday** or does it mean 
“ 3.14159 . .?” 

Meaning is whatever you assign 
and no computer can analyze it sim- 
ply from letter group. Give a com- 
puter enough groups and a rational 
theory involving meanings or sub- 
jects for meanings, and it will even- 
tually worry it out because meanings 
themselves will show patterns. But 
is a problem of different kind on 
more difficult level. 

Code we selected was commonest 
commercial code book, used both 
on Terra and in Luna for commer- 
cial dispatches. But we worked it 
over. Prof and Mike spent hours dis- 
cussing what information Party 
wish to send to its agent on Terra, 
or receive from agent, then Mike 
put his vast information to work 
and came up with new set of mean- 
ings for code book, ones that could 
say “Buy Thai rice futures” as easily 
as “Run for life; they’ve caught us.” 
Or anything, as cipher signals were 
buried in it to permit anything to 
be said that had not been anticipated. 

L ate one night Mike made print- 
out of new code via Lunaya 
Pravdtfs facilities, and night editor 
turned roll over to another comrade 
who converted it into a very small 
roll of film and passed it along in 
turn, and none ever knew what they 
handled or why. Wound up in Stu’s 
pouch. Search of offplant luggage 
was tight by then and conducted by 
bad-tempered Dragoons — but Stu 
was certain he would have no trou- 
ble. Perhaps he swallowed it. 
Thereafter some of LuNoHo Com- 

IF 



116 




pany’s dispatches to Terra reached 
Stu via his London broker. 

Part of purpose was financial. 
Party needed to spend money Earth- 
side; LuNoHoCo transferred money 
there (not all stolen, some ventures 
turned out well); Party needed still 
more money Earthside, Stu was to 
speculate, acting on secret knowl- 
edge of plan of revolution. He, Prof 
and Mike had spent hours discuss- 
ing what stocks would go up, what 
would go down, etc., after der Tag. 
This was Profs pidgin; I am not that 
sort of gambler. 

But money was needed before der 
Tag to build “climate of opinion.** 
We needed publicity, needed dele- 
gates and senators in Federated Na- 
tions, needed some nation to recog- 
nize us quickly once The Day came, 
we needed laymen telling other lay- 
men over a beer: “What is there 
on that pile of rock worth one sol- 
dier’s life? Let ’em go to hell in their 
own way, I say!** 

Money for publicity, money for 
bribes, money for dummy organiza- 
tions and to infiltrate established 
organizations, money to get true 
nature of Luna’s economy (Stu had 
gone loaded with figures) brought 
out as scientific research, then in 
popular form, money to convince 
foreign office of at least one major 
nation that there was advantage in 
a Free Luna, money to sell idea of 
Lunar tourism to a major cartel — 

Too much money! Stu offered own 
fortune and Prof did not discourage 
it. Where treasure is, heart will be. 
But still too much money and far 
too much to do. I did not know if 
Stu could swing a tenth of it; simply 



kept fingers crossed. At least it gave 
us a channel to Terra. Prof claimed 
that communications to enemy were 
essential to any war if was to be 
fought and settled sensibly. (Prof 
was a pacifist. Like his vegetarian- 
ing, he did not let it keep him from 
being “rational.” Would have made 
a terrific theologian.) 

As soon as Stu went Earthside, 
Mike set odds at one in thirteen. I 
asked him what in hell? “But, Man,” 
he explained patiently, “it increases 
risk. That it is a necessary risk does 
not Change the fact that risk is 
increased.” 

I shut up. 

A bout that time, early May, a new 
factor reduced some risks while 
revealing others. One part of Mike 
handled Terra-Luna microwave traf- 
fic — commercial messages, scientif- 
ic data, news channels, video, voice 
radiotelephony, routine Authority 
traffic — and Warden’s top-secret. 

Aside from last Mike could read 
any of this including commercial 
codes and ciphers. Breaking ciphers 
was a crossword puzzle to him and 
nobody mistrusted this machine. Ex- 
cept Warden, and I suspect that his 
was distrust of all machinery; was 
sort of person who finds anything 
more involved than a pair of scissors 
complex, mysterious and suspect. 
Stone Age mind. 

Warden used a code that Mike 
never saw. Also used ciphers and 
did not work them through Mike; 
instead he had a moronic little ma- 
chine in residence office. On top of 
this he had arrangement with Au- 
thority Earthside to switch every- 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



117 




thing around at preset times. No 
doubt he felt safe. 

Mike broke his cipher patterns 
and deduced time-change program 
just to try legs. He did not tackle 
code until Prof suggested it; it held 
no interest to him. 

But once Prof asked, Mike tackled 
Warden’s top-secret messages. He 
had to start from scratch; in past 
Mike had erased Warden’s messages 
once transmission was reported. So 
slowly, slowly he accumulated data 
for analysis — painfully slow, for 
Warden used this method only when 
he had to. Sometimes a week would 
pass between such messages. But 
gradually Mike began to gather 
meanings for letter groups, each as- 
signed a probability. A code does 
not crack all at once; possible to 
know meanings of ninety-nine 
groups in a message and miss essence 
because one group is merely GLOPS 
to you. 

However, user has a problem, too; 
if GLOPS comes through as GLOPT, 
he’s in trouble. Any method of com- 
munication needs redundancy, or in- 
formation can be lost. Was at re- 
dundancy that Mike nibbled, with 
perfect patience of machine. 

Mike solved most of Warden’s 
code sooner that he had projected; 
Warden was sending more traffic 
than in past and most of it one 
subject (which helped) — subject be- 
ing security and subversion. 

We had Mort yelling for help. 

He reported subversive activities 
still going on despite two phalanges 
of Peace Dragoons and demanded 
enough troops to station guards in 
all key spots inside all warrens. 



Authority told him this was pre- 
posterous, no more of FN’s crack 
troops could be spared — to be per- 
manently ruined for Earthside duties 
— and such requests should not be 
made. If he wanted more guards, he 
must recruit them from transpor- 
tees. But such increase in adminis- 
trative costs must be absorbed in 
Luna; he would not be allowed more 
overhead. He was directed to report 
what steps he had taken to meet new 
grain quotas set in our such-and- 
such. 

Warden replied that unless ex- 
tremely moderate requests for train- 
ed security personnel — not repeat 
not untrained, unreliable and unfit 
convicts — were met, he could no 
longer assure civil order, much less 
increased quotas. 

Reply asked sneeringly what dif- 
ference it made if ex-consignees 
chose to riot among themselves in 
their holes? If it worried him, had 
he thought of shutting off lights as 
was used so successfully in 1996 
and 2021? 

T hese exchanges caused us to re- 
vise our calendar, to speed 
some phases, slow others. Like a 
perfect dinner, a revolution has to 
be **cooked” so that everything 
comes out even. 

Stu needed time Earthside. We 
needed canisters and small steering 
rockets and associated circuitry for 
“rock throwing”. And steel was a 
problem — buying it, fabricating it, 
and above all moving it through 
meander of tunnels to new catapult 
site. We needed to increase Party at 
least into “K’s” — say 40,000 — 



118 



IF 




with lowest echelons picked for 
fighting spirit rather than talents we 
had sought earlier. We needed wea- 
pons against landings. We needed 
to move Mike’s radars, without 
which he was blind. (Mike could not 
be moved; bits of him spread all 
through Lune. But he had a thou- 
sand meters of rock over that cen- 
tral part of him at Complex, was 
surrounded by steel and this armor 
was cradled in springs; Authority 
had contemplated that someday 
somebody might lob H-weapons at 
their control center.) 

All these needed to be done and 
pot must not boil too soon. 

So we cut down on things that 
worried Warden and tried to speed 
up everything else. 

Simon Jester took a holiday. Word 
went out that Liberty Caps were not 
stylish — but save them. Warden got 
no more nervous-making phone calls. 
We quit inciting incidents with Dra- 
goons — which did not stop them 
but reduced number. 

Despite efforts to quiet Mort’s 
worries a symptom showed up which 
disquieted us instead. No message 
(at least we intercepted none) 
reached Warden agreeing to his d€s 
mand for more troops — but he 
started moving people out of Com- 
plex. Civil servants who lived there 
started looking for holes to rent in 
L-City. Authority started test driHs 
and resonance exploration in a cub- 
ic adjacent to L-Qty which could be 
converted into a warren. 

Could mean that Authority pro- 
posed shipping up unusually large 
<fraft of prisoners. Could mean Aat 
9p»ot in Complex was needed for 

THE MOOH IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



purpose other than quarters. But 
Mike told us: “Why kid yourselves? 
The Warden is going to get those 
troops; that space will be their bar- 
racks. Any other explanation I would 
have heard.” 

I said, “But Mike, why didn’t you 
hear if it’s troops? You have that 
code of Warden’s fairly well whip- 
ped.” 

“Not just ‘fairly well,’ I’ve got it 
whipped. But the last two ships have 
carried Authority vips and 7 don’t 
know what they talk about away 
from phones!” 

So we tried to plan to cover pos- 
sibility of having to cope with ten 
more phalanges, that being Mike’s 
estimate of what cubic being cleared 
would hold. We could deal with that 
many — with Mike’s help — but it 
would mean deaths, not bloodless 
coup d’etat Prof had planned. 

And we increased efforts to speed 
up other factors. 

When suddenly wc found our- 
selves committed.

H er name was Marie Lyons; she 
was eighteen years old and

exiled via Peace Corps in ’56. No 
record of father. She seems to have 
been a hannless person. Worked as 
a stock-control clerk in dipping de- 
partment, lived in Complex. 

Maybe she hated Authority and 
enjoyed teasing Peace Dragoons. Or 
perhaps it started as a commercial 
transaction as cold-blooded as any

were in it. Not satisfied with raping 
her (if rape it was) &ey abused her 
other ways and killed her. But they 
did not dispose of body neatly; an- 
other civil service fem found it be- 
fore was cold. She screamed. Was 
her last scream. 

We heard about it at once; Mike 
called us three while Alvarez and 
Peace Dragoon C.O. were digging 
into matter in Alvarez’s office. Ap- 
pears that Peace Goon boss had no 
trouble laying hands on guilty; he 
and Alvarez were questioning them 
one at a time, and quarreling be- 
tween grillings. Once we heard Al- 
varez say: “I told you those goons 
of yours had to have their own 
women! I warned you!” 

“Stuff it,” Dragoon officer an- 
swered. “I’ve told you time and 
again they won’t ship any. The ques- 
tion now is how we hush this up.” 

“Are you crazy? Warden already 
knows.” 

“It’s still the question.” 

“Oh, shut up and send in the 
next one.” 

Early in filthy story Wyoh joined 
me in workshop. Was pale under 
makeup, said nothing but wanted to 
sit close and clench my hand. 

At last was over and Dragoon of- 
ficer left Alvarez. Were still quarrel- 
ing. Alvarez wanted those six exe- 
cuted at once and fact made public 
(sensible but not nearly enough, for 
his needs); C.O. was still talking 
about “hushing it up.” Prof said, 
“Mike, keep an ear there and listen 
where else you can. Well, Mike? 
Wyoh? Plans?” 

I didn’t have any. Wasn’t a cold, 
shrewd revolutionist; just wanted to 



get my heel into faces that matched 
those six voices. “I don’t know. \\Tiat 
do we do. Prof?” 

“‘Do’? We’re on our tiger; we grab 
its ears. Mike. Where’s Hnn Niel- 
sen? Find him.” 

Mike answered, “He’s caHiag 
now.” 

He cut Finn in with us; I heard: 
“ — at Tube South. Both guards dead 
and about six of our people. Just 
people I mean, not necessarily com- 
rades. Some wild rumor about Goons 
going crazy and raping and killing 
all women at Complex. Adam, I had 
better talk to Prof.” 

“I’m here, Finn,” Prof answered 
in a strong, confident voice. “Now 
we move, we’ve got to. Switch off 
and get those laserguns and men 
who trained with them, any you can 
round up.” 

“Da! Okay, Adam?” 

“Do as Prof says. Then call back.” 
“Hold it, Finn!” I cut in. “Man- 
nie here. I want one of those guns.” 
“You haven’t practised, Mannie.” 
“If it’s a laser, I can use it!” 
“Mannie,” Prof said forcefully, 
“shut up. You’re wasting time; let 
Finn go. Adam. Message for Mike. 
Tell him Plan Alert Four.” 

P rof’s example damped my oscil- 
lating. Had forgotten that Finn 
was not supposed to know Mike as 
anybody but “Adam Selene;” for- 
gotten everything but raging anger. 
Mike said, “Finn has switched off. 
Prof, and I put Alert Four on stand- 
by when this broke. No traffic now 
except routine stuff filed earlier. 
You don’t want it interrupted, do 
you?”

“No, just follow Alert Four. No 
Earthside transmission either way 
that tips any news. If one comes in, 
hold it and consult.” “Alert Four” 
was emergency communication doc- 
trine, intended to slap censorship on 
news to Terra without arousing sus- 
picion. For this Mike was ready to 
talk in many voices with excuses as 
to why a direct voice transmission 
would be delayed — and any taped 
transmission was no problem. 
“Program running,” agreed Mike. 
“Good. Mannie, calm down, son, 
and stick to your knitting. Let other 
people do the fighting. You’re need- 
ed here, we’re going to have to im- 
provise. Wyoh, cut out and get word 
to Comrade Cecilia to get all Irreg- 
ulars out of the corridors. Get those 
children bcmie and keep them home 
— and have their mothers urging 
other mothers to do the same thing. 
We don’t know where the fighting 
will spread. But we don’t want chil- 
dren hurt if we can help it.” 

“Ri^t away. Prof!” 

“Wait. As soon as you’ve told 
Sidris, get moving on your stilyagi. 
I want a rkrt at the Authority’s city 
office — break in, wreck the place, 
and noise and shouting and destruc- 
tion — no one hurt if it can be help- 
ed. Mike. Alert-Four-Em. Cut off 
the Complex Except for your own 
lines.” 

“Prof!” I demanded. “What sense 
in starting riots here?” 

“Mannie, Mannie! This is The 
Day! Mike, has the rape and murder 
news reached other warrens?” 

“Not that I’ve heard. I’m listen- 
ing here and there with random 
jumps. Tube stations arc quiet ex- 



cept Luna City. Fighting has just 
started at Tube Station West. Want 
to hear it?” 

“Not now. Mannie, slide over 
there and watch it. But stay out of 
it and stick close to a phone. Mike, 
start trouble in all warrens. Pass die 
news down the cells and use Finn’s 
version, not the truth. The Goons are 
raping and killing all the women in 
the Complex — I’ll give you details 
or you can invent them. Uh, can you 
order the guards at tube stations ia 
other warrens back to their barracks? 
I want riots but there is no point ia 
sending unarmed people against 
armed men if we can dodge it.” 

“I’ll try.” 

I hurried to Tube Station West, 
slowed as I neared it. Corridors were 
full of angry people. City roared ia 
way I had never heard before and, as 
I crossed Causeway, could hear 
shouts and crowd noise from direc- 
tion of Authority’s city office al- 
though it seemed to me there had 
not been time for Wyoh to readi 
her stilyagi. Nor had there been. 
What Prof had tried to start was 
underway spontaneously. 

S tation was mobbed and I had to 
push through to see what I as- 
sumed to be certain, that passport 
guards were either dead or fled. 
“Dead” it turned out, along with 
three Loonies. One was a boy not 
more than thirteen. He had died with 
his hands on a Dragoon’s throat and 
his head still sporting a little red 
cap. I pushed way to a public phone 
and reported. 

“Go back,” said Prof, “and read 
the I.D. of one of those guards. I

want nasie and rank. Have you seen 
Finn?** 

“No.” 

“He’s headed there with three 
guns. Tdl me where the booth you’re 
in is, get that name and come back 
to it.” 

One body was gone, dragged 
away; Bog knows what they wanted 
with it. Other had been badly bat- 
tered but I managed to crowd in 
and snatch dog chain from neck 
before it, too, was taken somewhere. 
I elbowed back to phone, found a 
woman at it. “Lady,” I said, “I’ve 
fiot to use that phone. Emergency!” 
“You’re welcome to it! Pesky 
thing’s out of order.” 

Worked for me; Mike had saved 
it. Gave Prof guard’s name. “Good,” 
he said. **Have you seen Finn? He’ll 
be looking for you at that booth.” 
“Haven’t s — Hold it. Just spotted 
him.” 

“Okay, hang onto him. Mike, do 
you have a voice to fit that Dra- 
goon’s name?” 

“Sorry Prof. No.” 

“All right, just make it hoarse and 
frightened; chances are the C.O. 
won’t know it that well. Or would 
the trooper call Alvarez?” 

“He would call his C.O. Alvarez 
eives orders through him.” 

“So call the C.O. Report the at- 
tack and call for help and die in the 
middle of it. Riot sounds behind you 
and maybe a shout of ‘There’s the 
dirty bastard nowP just before you 
die. Can you swing it?” 

“Programmed. No huhu,” Mike 
said cheerfully. 

“Rub it. Mannie, put Finn on.” 
Profs plan wm to sucker off-duty

guards out of barracks and keep 
suckering them — with Finn’s men 
posted to pick them off as they got 
out of capsules. And it worked, 
right up to point where Mort the 
Wart lost his nerve and kept remain- 
ing few to protect himself while he 
sent frantic messages Earthside — 
none of which got through. 

I wiggled out of Prof’s discipline 
and took a lasergun when second 
capsule of Peace Dragoons was due. 
I burned two Goons, found blood 
lust gone and let other snipers have 
rest of squad. Too easy. They would 
stick heads up out of hatch and that 
would be that. Half of squad would 
not come out — until smoked out 
and then died with rest. By that time 
I was back at my advance post »t 
phone. 

Warden’s decision to hole up caus- 
ed trouble at Complex; Alvarez was 
killed and so was Goon C.O. and 
two of original yellow jackets. But a 
mixed lot of Dragoons and yellows, 
thirteen, holed up with Mort, or per- 
haps were already with him; Mike’s 
ability to follow events by listening 
was spotty. But once it seemed clear 
that all armed effectives were inside 
Warden’s residence, Prof ordered 
Mike to start next phase, 

Mike turned out all lights in Com- 
plex save those in Warden’s resi- 
dence, and reduced oxygen to gasp- 
ing point — not killing point but low 
enough to insure that anyone looking 
for trouble would not be in shape. 
But in residence oxygen supply was 
cut to zero, leaving pure nitrogen, 
and left that way ten minutes. At end 
of that time, Finn’s men, waiting in 
p-suits at Warden’s private tube sta- 
in 




tioD, broke iatdi on air lock and 
went in, **shoulder to Mulder.** 
Luna was ours. 

xxm 

S o a wave of patriotism swept over 
our new nation and unified it. 
Isn’t that what histories say? Oh, 
brother! 

My dinkum word, preparing a 
revolution isn’t as much huhu as 
having won it. Here we were, in 
control too soon, nothing ready and 
a thousand things to do. Authority 
in Luna was gone — but Lunar Au- 
thority Earthside and Federated Na- 
tions behind it were very much alive. 
Had they landed one troop ship, or- 
bited one cruiser, any time next 
week or two, could have taken Luna 
back cheap. We were a mob. 

New catapult had been tested but 
canned rock missiles ready to go you 
could count on fingers of one hand 
— my left hand. Nor was catapult a 
weapon that could be used against 
ships. Nor against troops. We had 
notions for fighting off ships; at 
moment were just notions. We had 
a few hundred cheap laserguns stock- 
piled in Hong Kong Luna — Chinee 
engineers are smart — but few men 
trained to use them. 

Moreover, Authority had useful 
functions. Bought ice and grain, sold 
air and water and power, held own- 
ership or control at a dozen key 
points. No matter what was done in 
future, wheels had to turn. Perhaps 
wrecking city offices of Authority 
had been hasty (I thought so) as 
records were destroyed. However, 
Prof maintained that Loonies, all 



Loonies, needed a symbol to hate 
and destroy and those offices were 
least valuable and most public. 

But Mike controlled conununica- 
tions and that meant control of most 
everything. 

Prof had started with control of 
news to and from Earthside, leaving 
to Mike censorship and faking of 
news until we could get around to 
what to tell Terra, and had added 
subphase M which cut off Complex 
from rest of Luna, and with it 
Richardson Observatory and asso- 
ciated laboratories — Pierce Radio- 
scope, Selenophysical Station and so 
forth. These were a problem as Ter- 
ran scientists were always coming 
and going and staying as long as 
six months, stretching time by cen- 
trifuge. Most Terrans in Luna, save 
for a handful of tourists (thirty- 
four) were scientists. Something had 
to be done about these Terrans, but 
meanwhile keeping them from talk- 
ing to Terra was enough. 

For time being Complex was cut 
off by phone and Mike did not per- 
mit capsules to stop at any station in 
Complex even after travel was re- 
sumed, which it was as soon as Finn 
Nielsen and squad was through with 
dirty work. 

Turned out Warden was not dead. 
Nor had we planned to kill him; 
Prof figured that a live warden 
could always be made dead, where- 
as a dead one could not be made 
live if we needed him. So plan was 
to half-kill him, make sure he and 
his guards could put up no fight, 
then break in fast white Mike re- 
stored oxygen. 

With fans turning at top speed 



124 



IF 




Mike computed it would take four 
minutes and a bit to reduce oxygen 
to effective zero. So, five minutes of 
increasing hypoxia, five minutes of 
anoxia, then force lower lock while 
Mike shot in pure oxygen to restore 
balance. This should not kill any- 
one — but would knock out a person 
as thoroughly as anesthesia. Hazard 
to attackers would come from some 
or all of those inside having p-suits. 
But even that might not matter. 
Hypoxia is sneaky, you can pass out 
without realizing you are short on 
oxygen. Is new chum’s favorite fatal 
mistake. 

So Warden lived through it and 
three of his women. But Warden, 
though he lived, was no use. Brain 
had been oxygen-starved too long. 
A vegetable. 

No guard recovered, even though 
younger than he. Would appear an- 
oxia broke necks. 

In rest of Complex nobody was 
hurt. Once lights were on and oxy- 
gen restored they were okay, includ- 
ing six rapist-murders under lock in 
barracks. Finn decided that shoot- 
ing was too good for them, so he 
went judge and used his squad as 
jury. 

They were stripped, hamstrung at 
ankles and wrists, turned over to 
women in Complex. Makes me sick 
to think about what happened next 
but don’t suppose they lived through 
as long an ordeal as Marie Lyons 
endured. Women are amazing crea- 
tures — sweet, soft, gentle and far 
more savage than we are. 

et me mention those fink spies 
out of order. Wyoh had been 



fiercely ready to eliminate them but 
when we got around to them she had 
lost stomach. I expected Prof to 
agree. But he shook head. “No, dear 
Wyoh, much as I deplore violence, 
there are only two things to do with 
an enemy: Kill him. Or make a 
friend of him. Anything in between 
piles up trouble for the future. A 
man who finks on his friends once 
will do it again and we have a long 
period ahead in which a fink can 
be dangerous; they must go. And 
publicly, to cause others to be 
thoughtful.” 

Wyoh said, “Professor, you once 
said that if you condemned a man, 
you would eliminate him personally. 
Is that what you are going to do?” 

“Yes, dear lady, and no. Their 
blood shall be on my hands; I ac- 
cept responsibility. But I have in 
mind a way more likely to discour- 
age other finks.” 

So “Adam Selene” announced that 
these persons had been employed by 
Juan Alvarez, late Security Chief for 
former Authority, as undercover 
spies — and gave names and ad- 
dresses. “Adam” did not suggest that 
anything be done. 

One man remained on dodge for 
seven months by changing warrens 
and name. Then early in ’77 his 
body was found outside Novylen’s 
south lock. But most of them lasted 
no more than hours. 

During first hours after coup 
d’etat we were faced with a problem 
we had never managed to plan — 
“Adam Selene” himself. Who is 
Adam Selene? Where is he? This 
is his revolution; he handled every 
detail, every comrade knows his 




THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



125 




voice. We’re out in open now . , . 
so where is Adam? 

We batted it around much of that 
night, in room L of Raffles — ar- 
gued it between decisions on a hun- 
dred things that came up and people 
wanted to know what to do, while 
“Adam” through other voices han- 
dled other decisions that did not re- 
quire talk, composed phony news to 
send Earthside, kept Complex iso- 
lated, many things. (Is no possible 
doubt; without Mike we could not 
have taken Luna nor held it.) 

My notion was that Prof should 
become “Adam.” Prof was always 
our planner and theoretician; every- 
body knew him; some key comrades 
knew that he was “Comrade Bill” 
and all others knew and respected 
Professor Bernardo de la Paz. My 
word, he had taught half of leading 
citizens in Luna City, many from 
other warrens, was known to every 
vip in Luna. 

“No,” said Prof. 

“Why not?” asked Wyoh. “Prof, 
you’re opted. Tell him, Mike.” 

“Comment reserved,” said Mike. 
“I want to hear what Prof has to 
say.” 

“I see you’ve analyzed it, Mike,” 
Prof answered. “Wyoh dearest com- 
rade, I would not refuse were it 
possible. But there is no way to make 
my voice match that of Adam — 
and every comrade knows Adam by 
his voice; Mike made it memorable 
for that very purpose.” 

W e then considered whether Prof 
couM be slipped in anyhow, 
showing him only on video and let- 
ting hGke reshape whatever Prof 



said into voice expected from 
“Adam.” 

Was turned down. Too many peo- 
ple knew Prof, had heard him speak; 
his voice and way of speaking could 
not be reconciled with “Adam.” 
Then they considered same possibil- 
ity for me — my voice and Mike’s 
were baritone and not too many peo- 
ple knew what I sounded like over 
phone and none over video. 

I tromped on it. People were 
going to be surprised enough to find 
me one of our Chairman’s lieuten- 
ants. They would never believe I 
was number one. 

I said, “Let’s combine deals. 
Adam has been a mystery all along; 
keep him that way. He’ll be seen 
only over video — in a mask. Prof, 
you supply body; Mike, you supply 
voice.” 

Prof shook head. “I can think of 
no surer way to destroy confidence 
at our most critical period than by 
having a leader who wears a mask. 
No, Mannie.” 

We talked about finding an actor 
to play it. Were no professional ac- 
tors in Luna then but were good 
amateurs in Luna Civic Players and 
in Novy Bolshoi Teatr Associates. 

“No,” said Prof, “aside from find- 
ing an actor of requisite character — 
one who would not decide to be Na- 
poleon — we can’t wait. Adam must 
start handling things not later than 
tomorrow morning.” 

“In that case,” I said, “you’ve an- 
swered it. Have to use Mike and 
never put him on video. Radio only. 
Have to figure excuse but Adam 
must never be seen.” 

“I’m forced to agree,” said Prof. 



126 



IF 




“Man my eldest friend,” said 
Mike, “why do you say that I can’t 
be seen?” 

“Haven’t you listened?” I said. 
“Mike, we have to show a face and 
body on video. You have a body — 
but it’s several tons of metal. A face 
you don’t have. Lucky you. Don’t 
have to shave.” 

“But what’s to keep me from 
showing a face, Man? I’m showing 
a voice this instant. But there’s no 
sound behind it. I can show a face 
tihe same way.” 

W as so taken aback I didn’t an- 
swer. I stared at video screen, 
installed when we leased that room. 
A pulse is a pulse is a pulse. Elec- 
trons chasing each other. To Mike, 
whole world was variable series of 
electrical pulses, sent or received or 
chasing around his innards. 

I said, “No, Mike.” 

“Why not, Man?” 

“Because you can’t. Voice you han- 
dle beautifully. Involves only a few 
thousand decisions a second, a slow 
crawl to you. But to build up video 
picture would require, uh, say ten 
million decisions every second. Mike, 
you’re so fast I can’t even think 
about it. But you aren’t that fast.” 
Mike said softly, “Want to bet, 
Man?” , 

Wyoh said indignantly, “Of course 
Mike can if he says he can! Mannie, 
you shouldn’t talk that way.” (Wyoh 
thinks an electron is something about 
size and shape of a small pea.) 

“Mike,” I said slowly, “I won’t 
put money on it. Okay, want to try? 
Shall I switch on video?” 

“I can switch it on,” he answered. 



“Sure you’ll get right one? 
Wouldn’t do to have this show 
somewhere else.” 

He answered testily, “I’m not stu- 
pid. Now let me be, Man — for I 
admit this is going to take just about 
all I’ve got.” 

We waited in silence. Then screen 
showed neutral gray with a hint of 
scant lines. Went black again, then 
a faint light filled middle and con- 
gealed into cloudy areas light and 
dark, ellipsoid. Not a face, but sug- 
gestion of face that one sees in cloud 
patterns covering Terra. 

It cleared a little and reminded me 
of pictures alleged to be ectoplasm. 
A ghost of a face. 

Suddenly firmed and we saw 
“Adam Selene.” 

Was a still picture of a mature 
man. No background, just a face as 
if trimmed out of a print. Yet was, 
to me, “Adam Selene.” Could not be 
anybody else. 

Then he smiled, moving lips and 
jaw and touching tongue to lips, a 
quick gesture — and I was fright- 
ened. 

“How do I look?” he asked. 

“Adam,” said Wyoh, “your hair 
isn’t that curly. And it should go 
back on each side above your fore- 
head. You look as if you were 
wearing a wig, dear.” 

Mike corrected it. “Is that bet- 
ter?” 

“Not quite so much. And don’t 
you have dimples? I was sure I could 
hear dimples when you chuckle. Like 
Prof’s.” 

Mike- Adam smiled again; this 
time he had dimples. “How shoii! ! 
I be dressed, Wyoh?” 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS

“Are you at your office?” 

“I’m still at office. Have to be 
tonight.” Background turned gray, 
then came into focus and color. A 
wall calendar behind him gave date, 
Tuesday 19 May 2076; a clock 
showed correct time. Near his elbow 
was a carton of coffee. On desk 
was a solid picture, a family group, 
two men, a woman, four children. 
Was background noise, muted roar 
of Old Dome Plaza louder than 
usual; I heard shouts and in distance 
some singing: Simon’s version of 
Marseillaise. 

Off screen Gmwidlah’s voice said, 
“Gospodin?” 

Adam turned toward it. “I’m busy, 
Albert,” he said patiently. “No calls 
from anyone but B. You handle 
every&ing else.” He looked back 
at us. “Well, Wyoh? Suggestions? 
Prof? Man my doubting friend? Will 
I pass?” 

I rubbed eyes. “Mike, can you 
cook?” 

“Certainly. But I don’t; I’m mar- 
ried.” 

“Adam,” said Wyoh, “how can 
you look so neat after the day we’ve 
had?” 

“I don’t let little things worry 
me.” He looked at Prof. “Professor, 
if the picture is okay, let’s discuss 
what I’ll say tomorrow. I was think- 
ing of pre-empting the eight hun- 
dred newscast, have it announced all 
night and pass the wmd down the 
cells.” 

W e talked rest of night. I sent 
up for coffee twice and Mike- 
Adam had his carton renewed. When 
I ordered sandwiches, he asked Gin- 



wallah to send out for some. I 
caught a glimpse of Albert Ginwid- 
lah in profile, a typical babu, poBto 
and faintly scornful. Hadn’t knows 
what he looked like. Mike ate while 
we ate, sometimes mumbling around 
a mouthful of food. 

When I asked (professional inter- 
est) Mike told me that, after he had 
picture built up, he had program- 
med most of it for automatic and 
gave his attention just to facial ex- 
pressions. But soon I forgot it was 
fake. Mike-Adam was talking wiA 
us by video, was all. Much more 
convenient than by phone. 

By oh-three-hundred we had pol- 
icy settled, then Mike rehearsed 
speech. Prof found points he wanted 
to add; Mike made revisions, then 
we decided to get some rest, even 
Mike-Adam was yawning — although 
in fact Mike held fort all through 
night, guarding transmissions to 
Terra, keeping Complex walled off, 
listening at many phones. Prof and 
I shared big bed, Wyoh stretched out 
on couch, I whistled lights out. For 
once we slept without weights. 

While we had breakfast, Adam 
Selene addressed Free Luna. 

He was gentle, strong, warm and 
persuasive. “Citizens of Free Luna, 
friends, comrades — to those of you 
who do not know me let me intro- 
duce myself. I am Adam Selene, 
Chairman of the Emergency Com- 
mittee of Comrades for Free Luna 
. now of Free Luna, we are free 
at last. The so-called ‘Authority’ 
which has long usurped power in 
this our home has been overthrown. 
I find myself temporary head of 
the Emergency Committee.

IF 




“Shortly, as quickly as can be ar- 
ranged, you will opt your own gov- 
ernment.” Adam smiled and made 
a gesture inviting help. “In the 
meantime, with your help, I shall do 
my best. We will make mistakes — 
be tolerant. Comrades, if you have 
not revealed yourselves to friends 
and neighbors, it is time you did so. 
Citizens, requests may reach you 
through your comrade neighbors. I 
hope you will comply willingly; it 
will speed the day when I can bow 
out and life can get back to normal 

— a new normal, free of the Author- 
ity, free of guards, free of troops 
stationed on us, free of passports 
and searches and arbitrary arrests. 

‘There has to be a transition. 
To all of you — please go back to 
work, resume normal lives. To those 
who worked for the Authority, the 
need is the same. Go back to work. 
Wages will go on, your jobs stay the 
same, until we can decide what is 
needed, what happily no longer is 
needed now that we are free, and 
what must be kept but modified. 
You new citizens, transportees sweat- 
ing out sentences pronounced on 
you Earthside — you are free, your 
sentences are finished! But in the 
meantime I hope that you will go 
on working. You are not required 
to — the days of coercion are gone 

— but you are urged to. You are of 
course free to leave the Complex, 
free to go anywhere . and capsule 
service to and from the Complex 
will resume at once. But before you 
use your new freedom to rush into 
town, let me remind you: “There is 
no such thing as a free lunch.’ You 
are better off for the time being 



where you are; the food may not be 
fancy but will continue hot and on 
time. 

“To take on temporarily those 
necessary functions of the defunct

soon as possible. Conversely, you 
are welcome to stay, still more wel- 
come to become citizens. But for 
the present I urge you to stay out of 
the corridors, avoid incidents that 
might lead to unnecessary blood, un- 
necessary pain. Be patient with us 
and I urge my fellow citizens to be 
patient widi you. Scientists from 
Terra, at the Observatory and else 
where, go on with your work and 
ignore us. Then you won’t even no- 
tice that we are going through the 
pangs of creating a new nation. One 
thing. I am sorry to say that we are 
temporarily interfering witih your 
right to communicate with Earth- 
side. This we do from necessity; cen- 
sorship will be lifted as quickly as 
possible — we hate k as much as 
you do.”

Adam added one more request; 
“Don’t try to see me, comrades, and 
phone me only if you must. All 
others, write if you need to, your 
letters will receive prompt attention. 
But I am not twins, I got no sleep 
last night, and can’t expect much 
tonight. I can’t address meetings, 
can’t shake hands, can’t meet dele- 
gation; I must stick to this desk and 
work — so that I can get rid of this 
job and turn it over to your choice.” 
He grinned at them. “Expect me to 
be as hard to see as &non Jester!”

was a fifteen-minute cast but 
J. that was essence: Go back to 
vork, be patient, give us time. 

Those scientists gave us almost 
no time. I should have guessed; was 
my sort of pidgin. 

All communication Earthside 
channeled through Mike. But those 
brain boys had enough electronic 
equipment to stock a warehouse; 
once they decided to, it took them 
only hours to breadboard a rig that 
could reach Terra. 

Only thing that saved us was a 
fellow traveler who thought Luna 
should be free. He tried to phone 
Adam Selene, wound up talking to 
one of a squad of women we had 
co-opted from C and D level — a 
system thrown together in self-de- 
fense as, despite Mike’s request, half 
of Luna tried to phone “Adam Se- 
lene” after that videocast, every- 
thing from requests and demands to 
busybodies who wanted to tell Adam 
bow to do his job. 

After about a hundred calls got 



routed to me through too much zeal 
by a comrade in phone compsuiy, 
we set up this buffer squad. Hapfsly, 
comrade lady who took this call rec- 
ognized that soothe-’em-down doc- 
trine did not apply; she phoned me. 

Minutes later myself and Finn 
Nielsen plus some eager guns headed 
by capsule for laboratory area. Our 
informant was scared to give name 
but had told me where to find trans- 
mitter. We caught them transmit- 
ting, and only fast action on Finn’s 
part kept them breathing; his boys 
were itchy. But we did not want to 
“make an example;” Finn and I had 
settled that on way out. Is hard to 
frighten scientists, their minds don’t 
work that way. Have to get at them 
from other angles. 

I kicked that transmitter to pieces 
and ordered Director to have every- 
one assemble in mess hall and re- 
quired roll call — where a phone 
could hear. Then I talked to Mike, 
got names from him, and said to 
Director; 

“Doctor, you told me they were 
all here. We’re missing so-and-so” 
— seven names. **Get them herer 

Missing Terrans had been noti- 
fied, had refused to stop what they 
were doing. Typical scientists. 

Then I talked, Loonies on one 
side of room, Terrans on other. To 
Terrans I said: “We tried to treat 
you as guests. But three of you 
tried and perhaps succeeded in send- 
ing message Earthside.” 

I turned to Director. “Doctor, I 
could search — warren, surface 
structures, all labs, every space — 
and destroy everything that might 
be used for transmitter. I’m elec- 



130 



IF 




tron pusher by trade; 1 know what 
wide variety of components can be 
converted into transmitters. Suppose 
I destroy everything that might be 
useful for that and, being stupid, 
take no chance and smash anything 
I don’t understand. What result?” 

W ould have thought I was about 
to kill his baby! He turned 
gray. “That would stop every re- 
search . destroy priceless data 
... waste, oh, I don’t know how 
much! Call it a half billion dollars!” 
“So I thought. Could take all that 
gear instead of smashing and let 
you go on best you can.” 

“That would be almost as bad! 
You must understand, Gospodin, 
that when an experiment is intw- 
rupted — ” 

“I know. Easier than moving any- 
thing — and maybe missing some — 
is to take you all to Complex and 
quarter you there. We have what 
used to be Dragoon barracks. But 
— Where you from. Doctor?” 
“Princeton, New Jersey.” 

“So? You’ve been here five 
months and no doubt exercising and 
wearing weights. Doctor, if we did 
that, you might never see Princeton 
again. If we move you, we’ll keep 
you locked up. You’ll get soft. If 
emergency goes on very long, you’ll 
be a Loonie like it or not. And all 
your brainy help with you.” 

A cocky chum stepped forward — 
one who had to be sent for twice. 
“You can’t do this! It’s against the 
law!” 

“What law, Gospodin? Some law 
back in your home town?” I turned. 
“Finn, show him law.” 

THE MCX>N IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



Finn stepped forward and placed 
emission bell of gun at man’s belly 
button. Thumb started to press down 
— safety-switched, I could see. I 
said, “Don’t kill him, Finn;” — then 
went on: “I will eliminate this man 
if that’s what it takes to convince 
you. So watch each other! One more 
offense will kill all your chances of 
seeing home again — as well as 
ruining researches. Doctor, I warn 
you to find ways to keep check on 
your staff.” 

I turned to Loonies. “Tovarischee, 
keep them honest. Work up own 
guard system. Don’t take nonsense; 
every earthworm is on probation. 
If you have to eliminate some, don’t 
hesitate.” I turned to Director. 
“Doctor, any Loonie can go any- 
where any time — even your bed- 
room. Your assistants are now your 
bosses so far as security is concerned. 
If a Loonie decides to follow you 
or anybody into a W.C., don’t argue! 
he might be jumpy.” 

I turned to Loonies. “Security 
first! You each work for some earth- 
worm — watch him! Split it among 
you and don’t miss an^hing. Watch 
’em so close they can’t build mouse 
trap, much less transmitter. If inter- 
feres with work for them, don’t wor- 
ry; wages will go on.” 

Could see grins. Lab assistant was 
best job a Loonie could find those 
days — but they worked under earth- 
worms who looked down on us, even 
ones who pretended and were oh so 
gracious. 

I let it go at that. When I had 
been phoned, I had intended to eli- 
minate offenders. But Prof and Mike 
set me straight: Plan did not permit 

131 




liQlence against Terram that could 
be svokled. 

We set up “ears,” wideband seosi- 
^ve receivers, around lab area, since 
eeeap mewt (Sectional rig spills a 
IMe in neighborhood. And Mike lis- 
tened on all fdaones in area. After 
tb»t we chewed nails and hoped. 

Presently we relaxed as news from 
Barthside showed nothing, they 
seemed to accept censored transmis- 
saons; without suspicion, and private 
and commercial traffic and Author- 
ity’s transmissions all seemed rou- 
tine. Meanwhile we worked, trying 
in days what should take months. 

W e received one break in tim- 
ing; no passenger ship was on 
Uma and none was due until 7 July. 

We could have coped r— suckered 
a ship’s officers to “dine with War- 
den” or something, then mounted 
guard on its senders or dismantled 
than.- Could not have lifted without 
our help; in those days one drain on 
ice was providing water for reaction 
mass. Was not much drain compared 
with grain shipments. One manned 
ship a month was heavy traffic then, 
while grain lifted every day. What 
it did mean was that an incoming 
ship was not an insuperable hazard. 
Nevertheless was lucky break; we 
were trying so hard to make every- 
thing look normal until we could 
defend ourselves. 

Grain shipments went on as be- 
fore; one was catapulted almost as 
Finn’s men were breaking into War- 
den’s residence. And next went out 
OB time, and all others. 

Ndther oversight nor faking for 
ioterim; Prof knew what he was do- 



i^ Grain shipments were a big op- 
eration (ft» a little country Kke 
Luna) and couldn’t be changed in 
one semi-lunar; bread-ami-beer of 
too many p«)ple was involved. If 
our Committee had ordered enrisargo 
and quit buying grain, we would 
have been chucked out and a new 
committee with other ideas would 
have taken over. 

Prof said that an educational per- 
iod was necessary. Meanwhile grain 
barges catapulted as iBual; LuNo- 
HoCo kept books and issued receipts, 
using civil service personnel. Dis- 
patches went out in Warden’s name 
and Mike talked to Authority Earth- 
side, using Warden’s voice. Deputy 
Administrator proved reasonable, 
once he understood it upped his 
life expectancy. Chief Engineer stay- 
ed on job, too — McIntyre was a 
real Loonie, given chance, rather 
than fink by nature. Other depart- 
n^t heads and minor stooges were 
no problem; life went on as before 
and we were too busy to unwind 
Authority system and put useful 
parts up for sale. 

Over a dozen people turned up 
claiming to be Simon Jester; Simon 
wrote a rude verse disclaiming them 
and had picture on front page of 
Lunatic, Pravda, and Gong. Wyoh 
let herself go blonde and made trip 
to see Greg at new catapult site, 
then a longer trip, ten days to old 
home in Hong Kong Luna, taking 
Anna who wanted to see it. Wyoh 
needed a vacation and Prof urged 
her to take it, pointing out that she 
was in touch by phone and that 
closer Party contact was needed in 
Hong Kong. 




I took over her stilyagi with Slim 
»nd Hazel as my lieutenants — 
bright, sharp kids I could trust. Slim 
was awed to discover that I was 
“Comrade Bork” and saw “Adam 
Selene” every day; his Party name 
started with “G.” Made a good team 
for other reason, too. Hazel sud- 
denly started showing cushiony 
curves and not all from Mimi’s sup- 
erb table; she had reached that point 
in her orbit. Slim was ready to 
change her name to “Stone” any 
time she was willing to opt. In mean- 
time he was anxious to do Party 
work he could share with our fierce 
little redhead. 

Not everybody was willing. Many 
comrades turned out to be talk-talk 
soldiers. Still more thought war was 
over once we had eliminated Peace 
Goons and captured Warden. Others 
were indignant to learn how far 
down they were in Party structure; 
they wanted to elect a new structure, 
themselves at top. Adam received 
endless calls proposing this or some- 
thing like it. Would listen, agree, 
assure them their services must not 
be wasted by waiting for election 
— and refer them to Prof or me. 
Can’t recall any of these ambitious 
people who amounted to anything 
when I tried to put them to work. 

Was endless work and nobody 
wanted to do it. Well, a few. Some 
best volunteers were people Party 
had never located. But in general. 
Loonies in and out of Party had no 
interest in “patriotic” work unless 
well paid. 

One chum who claimed to be a 
Party member (was not) spragged 
me in Raffles where we set up head- 



quarters and wanted me to contract 
for fifty thousand buttons to be 
worn by pre-coup “Veteraas of Rev- 
olution” — a “small” profit for 
him (I estimate 400% markup), 
easy dollars for me, a fine thing for 
everybody. 

When I brushed him off, he threat- 
ened to denounce me to Adam Se- 
lene — “A very good friend of mine, 
ni have you know!” — for sabo- 
tage. 

<^^hat was “help” we got. What we 
needed was something else. 
Needed steel at new catapult and 
plenty — Prof asked if really neces- 
sary to put steel around rock mis- 
siles; I had to point out that an in- 
duction field won’t grab bare rock. 
We needed to relocate Mike’s ballis- 
tic radars at old site and install dop- 
pler radar at new site — both jobs 
because we could expect attacks 
from space at old site. 

We called for volunteers, got only 
two who could be used — and need- 
ed several hundred mechanics who 
did not mind hard work in p-suits. 
So we hired, paying what we had to. 
LuNoHoCo went in hock to Bank of 
Hong Kong Luna; was no time to 
steal that much and most funds had 
been transferred Earthside to Sbi. A 
dinkum comrade, Foo Moses Mor- 
ris, co-signed much paper to ke^ 
us going — and wound up broke and 
started over with a little tailoring 
shop in Kongville — that was later. 

Authority Scrip dropped from 3- 
to-I to 17-to-l after coup and civil 
service people screamed, as Mike 
was still paying in Authority checks. 
We said Aey could stay on or re- 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS

agn. Then those we needed we re- 
hired with Hong Kong dollars. But 
created a large group not on our side 
from then on; they longed for good 
old days and were ready to stab new 
regime. 

Grain farmers and brokers were 
unhappy because payment at cata- 
pult head continued to be Authority 
scrip at same old fixed prices. “We 
won’t take it!” they cried — and 
LuNoHoCo man would shrug and 
tell them they didn’t have to but 
this grain still went to Authority 
Earthside (it did) and Authority 
scrip was all they would get. So 
take cheque, or load your grain 
back into rolligons and get it out of 
here. 

Most took it. All grumbled and 
some threatened to get out of grain 
and start growing vegetables or fft>- 
ers or something that brought Hong 
Kong dollars — and Prof smiled. 

We needed every drillman in Luna, 
especially ice miners who owned 
heavy-duty laser drills. As soldiers. 
We needed them so badly that, de- 
spite being shy one wing and rusty, 
I considered joining up, even thou^ 
takes muscle to wrestle a big drill, 
and a prosthetic just isn’t muscle. 
Prof told me not to be a fool. 

Dodge we had in mind would not 
work well Earthside. A laser beam 
carrying heavy power works best in 
vacuum — but there it works just 
dandy for whatever range its coDi- 
mation is good for. These big drills, 
which had carved through rock seek- 
ing pockets of ice, were now being 
mounted as “artaicry” to repel space 
attacks. Both and misses hare 
electronic nervous sytems and does 

THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



electronic gear no good to blast it 
with umpteen joules packed in a 
tight beam. If target is pressured (as 
manned ships are and most missiles) , 
all it takes is to bum a hole, depres- 
sure it. If not pressured, a heavy 
laser beam can still kill it — bum 
eyes, louse guidance, spoil anything 
depending on electronics as most 
everything does. 

An H-bomb with circuitry ruined 
is not a bomb, is just a big tub of 
lithium deuteride that can’t do any- 
thing but crash. A ship with eyes 
gone is a derelict, not a warship. 

Sounds easy, is not. Those laser 
drills were never meant for targets 
a thousand kilometers away, or even 
one, and was no quick way to rig 
their cradles f<» accuracy. Gunner 
had to have guts to hold fire until 
last few seconds — on a target head- 
ing at him maybe two kilometers 
per second. 

But was best we had, so we or- 
ganized First and Second Volunteer 
Defense Gunners of Free Luna. Two 
regiments — so that First could snub 
lowly Second and Second could be 
jealous of Rrst. First got older men. 
Second got young and eager. 

Having c^ed them "Volunteers” 
we hired in Hong Kong dollars — 
and was no accident that ice was 
being paid for in controlled market 
in wastepaper Authority scrip. 

O n top of aU, we were talking up 
a war scare. Adam Selene 
talked over video, reminding that 
Authority was certain to try to re- 
gain its tyranny and we had only 
days to prepare; papers quoted him 
and published stories of tiieir own 




— we had made special effort to 
recruit newsmen before coup. Peo- 
ple were urged to keep p-suits ready 
and to test pressure alarms in homes, 
A volunteer Civil Defense Corps was 
organized in each warren. 

What with moonquakes always 
with us, each warren’s pressure co-op 
always had sealing crews ready at 
any hour. Even with silicone stay- 
soft and fiberglas any warren leaks. 
In Davis Tunnels our boys did main- 
tenance on seal every day. But now 
we recruited hundreds of emergency 
sealing crews, mostly stilyagi, drilled 
them with fake emergencies, had 
them stay in p-suits with helmets 
open when on duty. 

They did beautifully. But idiots 
made fun of them — “play soldiers.” 
“Adam’s little apples,” other names. 
A team was going through a drill, 
showing they could throw a tem- 
porary lock around one that had 
been damaged, and one of these 
pinheads stood by and rode them 
loudly. 

Civil Defense team went ahead, 
completed temporary lock, tested it 
with helmets closed; it held — came 
out, grabbed this joker, took him 
through into temporary lock and 
out into zero pressure, dumped him. 

Belittlers kept opinions to selves 
after that. Prof thought we ought to 
send out a gentle warning not to 
eliminate so peremptorily. I oppos- 
ed it and got my way; could see no 
better way to improve breed. Cer- 
tain types of loudmouthism should 
be a capital offense among decent 
people. 

But our biggest headaches were 
self-anointed statesmen. 



Did I say that Loonies are “non- 
political”? They are, when comes to 
doing anything. But doubt if was 
ever a time two Loonies over a liter 
of beer did not swap loud opinions 
about how things ought to be run. 

As mentioned, these self-appointed 
political scientists tried to grab Adam 
Selene’s ear. But Prof had a place 
for them; each was invited to take 
part in “Ad-Hoc Congress for Or- 
ganization of Free Luna” — which 
met in Community Hall in Luna 
City, then resolved to stay in ses- 
sion until work was done, a week 
in L-City, a week in Novylen, then 
Hong Kong, and start over. All ses- 
sions were on video. Prof presided 
over first and Adam Selene address- 
ed them by video and encouraged 
them to do a thorough job — “His- 
tory is watching you.” 

I listened to some sessions, then 
cornered Prof and asked what in 
Bog’s name he was up to? “Thought 
you didn’t want any government? 
Have you heard those nuts since you 
turned them loose?” 

He smiled most dimply smile. 
“What’s troubling you, Manuel?” 
Many things were troubling me. 
With me breaking heart trying to 
round up heavy drills and men who 
could treat them as guns the^e idlers 
had spent an entire afternoon dis- 
cussing immigration. Some wanted 
to stop it entirely. Some wanted to 
tax it, high enough to finance gov- 
ernment (when ninety-nine out of 
a hundred Loonies had had to be 
dragged to The Rock!); some want- 
ed to make it selective by “ethnic 
ratios.” (Wondered how they would 
count me?) Some wanted to limit

it to females until we were 50-50. 
That had produced a Scandinavian 
shout: “Ja, cobber! Tell ’em send 
us tousands and tousands vimmen! 
I marry ’em, I betcha!” 

Was most sensible remark all af- 
ternoon. 

A nother time they argued “time.” 
Sure, Greenwich time bears no 
relation to lunar. But why should 
it when we live underground? Show 
me a Loonie who can sleep two 
wedts and work two weeks; lunars 
<kMi*t fit our metabolism. What was 
urged was to make a lunar exactly 
eqpial to twenty-eight days (instead 
of 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, 
2.78 seconds) and do this by mak- 
ing days longer — and hours, min- 
irtes, and seconds, thus making each 
semi-lunar exactly two weeks. 

Sure, lunar is necessary for many 
purposes. Controls when we go up 
on surface, why we go and how 
long we stay. But, aside from throw- 
ing us out of gear with our only 
neighbor, had that wordy vacuum 
skull thought what this would do to 
every critical figure in science and 
engineering? As an electronics man 
I shuddered. Throw away every 
book, table, instrument, and start 
over? I know that some of my an- 
cestors did that in switching from 
<rfd English units to MKS — but 
they did it to make things easier. 
Fourteen inches to a foot and some 
odd number of feet to a mile. 
Otmces and pounds. Oh, Bog! 

Made sense to change that — 
but why go out of your way to 
create confusion? 

Somebody wanted a committee 

xm MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



to determine exactly what Loonie 
language is, then fine everybody who 
talked Earthside English or other 
language. Oh, my people! 

I read tax proposals in Lunatic 
— four sorts of “Single-Taxers” — 
a cubic tax that would penalize a 
man if he extended tunnels, a head 
tax (everybody pay same), income 
tax (like to see anyone figure in- 
come of Davis Family or try to get 
information out of Mum!), and an 
“air tax” which was not fees we 
paid then but something else. 

Hadn’t realized “Free Luna” was 
going to have taxes. Hadn’t had 
any before and got along. You 
paid for what you got. Tanstaafl. 
How else? 

Another time some pompous 
choom proposed that bad breath and 
body odors be made an elimination 
offense. Could almost sympathize, 
having been stuck on occasion in a 
capsule with such stinks. But doesn’t 
happen often and tends to be self- 
correcting; chronic offenders, or un- 
fortunates who can’t correct, aren’t 
likely to reproduce, seeing how 
choosy women are. 

One female (most were men, but 
women made up for it in silliness) 
had a long list she wanted made 
permanent laws — about private 
matters. No more plural marriage 
of any sort. No divorces. No “forni- 
cation” — had to look that one up. 
No drinks stronger than 4% beer. 
Church services only on Saturdays 
and all else to stop that day. (Air 
and temperature and pressure en- 
gineering, lady? Phones and cap- 
sules?) A long list of drugs to be 
prohibited and a shorter list dis-

pensed oiily by licensed plsysicians. 
(What is a “licensed physician”? 
Healer I go to has a sign riding 
“practical doctor”. Makes book on 
sWe, which is why I go to him. 
Look, lady, aren’t any medical 
schools in Luna!) (Then, I mean.) 
She even wanted to make gambling 
illegal. If a Loonie couldn’t roll dou- 
ble or nothing, he would go to a 
shop that would, even if dice were 
loaded. 

Thing that got me was not her list 
of things she hated since she was 
obviously crazy as a Cyborg but 
fact that always somebody agreed 
with her prohibitions. Must be a 
yearning deep in human heart to 
stop other people from doing as 
they please. Rules, laws — always 
for other fellow. A murky part of 
us, something we had before we 
came down out of trees, and failed 
to shuck when we stood up. Be- 
cause not one of those people said; 
“Please pass this so that I won’t be 
able to do something I know I 
should stop.” Nyet, tovarishchee, 
was always somet^g they hated to 
see neighbors doing. Stop them “for 
their own good” — not because 
speaker claimed to be harmed by it. 

Listening to that session 1 was 
almost sorry we got rid of Mort the 
Wart. He stayed holed up with his 
women and chdn’t tell us how to run 
private lives. 

B ut Prof di^’t get excited; he 
went on smiling. “Manuel, do 
you really diink that mob of re- 
tarded children can pass any laws?” 
“You told them to. Urged them 
to.” 



“My dear Manuel, I was simply 
putting all my nuts in one basket 
I know those nuts; I’ve listened to 
them for years. I was very careful 
in selecting their committees; they 
all have built-in confusion, they will 
quarrel. The chairman I forc^ on 
them while letting them elect him 
is a ditherer who could not unravel 
a piece of string — thinks every 
subject needs ‘more study.’ I almost 
needn’t have bothered. More than 
six people cannot agree on any- 
thing, three is better — and one is 
perfect for a job that one can do. 
This is why parliamentary bodies 
all through history, when they ac- 
complished anything, owed it to a 
few strong men who dominated the 
rest. Never fear, son, this ‘Ad-Hoc 
Congress’ will do nothing ... or if 
they pass something through sheer 
fatigue, it will be so loaded with 
contradictions that it will have to 
be thrown out. In the meantime 
they are out of our hair. Besides, 
there is something we need them for, 
later.” 

“Thought you said they could do 
nothing.” 

“They won’t do this. One man 
will write it — a dead man — and 
late at night when they are very 
tired, they’ll pass it by acclama- 
tion.” 

“Who’s this dead man? You don’t 
mean Mike?” 

“No, no! Mike is far more alive 
than those yammerheads. The dead 
man is Thomas Jefferson — first 
of the rational anarchists, my boy, 
and one who once almost managed 
to slip over his non-system through 
the most beautiful rhetoric ever writ-

ten. But they caught him at it, 
which I hope to avoid. I cannot im- 
prove on his phrasing; I shall mere- 
ly adapt it to Luna and the tw«ly- 
first century.” 

“Heard of him. Freed slaves 
nyet?” 

“One might say he tried but fail- 
ed. Never mind. How we the de- 
fenses progressing? I don’t see how 
we can keep up the pretense past 
the arrival date of this next ship.” 

“Can’t be ready then. Entirely out 
of question.” 

“Mike says we must be.” 

We weren’t but ship never ar- 
rived. Those scientists outsmarted 
me and Loonies I had told to watch 
them. Was a rig at focal point of 
biggest reflector and Loonie assis- 
tants believed doubletalk about as- 
tronomical purpose — a new wrin- 
kle in radiotelescopes for ultravidet 
research purposes. 

I suppose it was. Was ultramicro- 
wave and stuff was bounced at re- 
flector by a wave guide and thus 
left scope lined up nicely by mirror. 
Remarkably like early radar. And 
metal latticework and foil heat shield 
of barrel stopped stray radiation, 
thus “ears” I had staked out heard 
nothing. 

They put message across, then- 
version and in detail. First we heard 
was demand from Authority to War- 
den to deny this hoax, find hoaxer, 
put stop to it. 

So instead we gave them a Dec- 
laration of Independence, using 
model already on hand. 

“In Congress assembled, July 
Fourth, Twenty Seventy-Six — ” 

Was beautiful. 

THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



S igning of Declaration of Indepen- 
dence went as Prel said it 
would. He sprang it m tfiem at end 
of long day, announced a special 
session after dinner at which Adam 
Selene would speak. 

Adam read aloud, discussing each 
sentence, then read it without stop- 
ping, making music of sonorous 
phrases. People wept. Wyoh, seated 
by me, was one, and I felt like it 
even though had read it earlier. 

Then Adam looked at them and 
said, “The future is waiting. Mark 
well what you do,” and turned meet- 
ing over to Prof rather than usual 
chairman. 

Was twenty-two huiidred and 
fight began. 

Sure, they were in favor of it. 
News all day had been jammed 
with what bad boys we were, how 
we were to be punished, taught a 
lesson, so forth. Not imoessary to 
spice it up; stuff up from Earth- 
side was narsty — Mike merely left 
out on-other-hand opinions. If ever 
was a day when Luna fdt unified 
it was probably second of July 2076.. 

So they were going to pass it; 
Prof knew that before he offered 
it. 

But not as written — “Honor- 
able Chairman, in second paragraph, 
that word ‘unalienable,’ is no such 
word; should be ‘malienable’ — and 
anyhow wouldn’t it be more digni- 
fied to say ‘sacred rights’ rather 
than ‘inalienable rights’? I’d like to 
hear discussion on this.” 

That choom was almost sensi- 
ble, merely a literary critic, which 

13f 




is harmless, like dead yeast left in 
beer. But — Well, take that woman 
who hated everything. She was 
there with list; read it aloud and 
moved to have it incorporated into 
Declaration, “So that the peoples of 
Terra wiU know that we are civilized 
and fit to take our places in the 
councils of mankind!” 

Prof not only let her get away 
with it; he encouraged her, letting 
her talk when other people wanted 
to — then blandly put her proposal 
to a vote when hadn’t even been 
seconded. (Congress operated by 
rules they had wrangled over for 
days. Prof was familiar with rules 
but followed them only as suited 
him.) She was voted down in a 
shout, and left. 

Then somebody stood up and said 
of course that long list didn’t be- 
long in Declaration — but shouldn’t 
we have general principles? Maybe 
a statement that Luna Free State 
guaranteed freedom, equality and 
security to all? Nothing elaborate, 
just those fundamental principles 
that everybody knew was proper 
purpose of government. 

True enough and let’s pass it. But 
must read ‘Treedom, equality, peace 
and security” — right, comrade? 
They wrangled over whether “free- 
dom” included “free air,” or was 
that part of “security”? Why not 
be on safe side and list “free air” 
by name? Move to amend to make 
it “Free air and water” — because 
you didn’t have “freedom” or 
“security” unless you had both air 
and water. 

Air, water, and food. 

Air, water, food, and cubic. 



Air, water, food, cubic, and heat. 

No, make “heat” read “power” 
and you had it all covered. Every- 
thing. 

Cobber, have you lost your mind? 
That’s far from everything and what 
you’ve left out is an affront to all 
womankind — Step outside and say 
that! Let me finish. We’ve gert to 
tell them right from deal that we 
will permit no more ships to land 
unless they carry at least as many 
women as men. At least, I said. 
And I for one won’t chop it unless 
it sets immigration issue straight. 

Prof never lost dimples. 

Began to see why Prof had slept 
all day and was not wearing weights. 
Me, I was tired, having spent all 
day in p-suit out beyond catapult 
head cutting in last of reloc^ed 
ballistic radars. And everybody was 
tired; by midnight crowd began to 
thin, convinced that nothing would 
be accomplished that night and bor- 
ed by any yammer not their own. 

W as later than midnight when 
someone asked why this Dec- 
laration was dated fourth when to- 
day was second? 

Prof said mildly that it was July 
third now — and it seemed unlikely 
that our Declaration could be an- 
nounced earlier than fourth . and 
that July fourth carried historical 
symbolism that might help. 

Several people walked out at an- 
nouncement that probably nothing 
would be settled until fourth of July. 
But I began to notice something: 
Hall was filling as fast as was emp- 
tying. Finn Nielsen slid into a seat 
that had just been vacated. Comrade 



140 



IF 




Clayton from Hong Kong showed 
up, pressed my shoulder, smiled at 
Wyoh, found a seat. My youngest 
lieutenants. Slim and Hazel, I spot- 
ted them down front — and was 
thinking I must alibi Hazel by tell- 
ing Mum I had kept her out on 
Party business — when was amazed 
to see Mum next to them. And Sid- 
ris. And Greg, who was supposed 
to be at new catapult. 

Looked around and picked out a 
dozen more — night editor of Luna- 
ya Pravda, General Manager of 
LuNoHoCo, others, and each one a 
working comrade. Began to see that 
Prof had stacked deck. That Con- 
gress never had a fixed membership; 
diese dinkum comrades had as much 
right to show up as those who had 
been talking a month. Now they sat 
— and voted down amendments. 

About three hundred, when I was 
wondering how much more I could 
take, someone brought a note to 
Prof. He read it, banged gavel and 
said, “Adam Selene begs your in- 
dulgence. Do I hear unanimous con- 
sent?^ 

So screen back of rostrum lighted 
up again and Adam told them that 
he had been following debate and 
was warmed by many thoughtful 
and constructive criticisms. But 
could he make a suggestion? Why 
not admit that any piece of writing 
was imperfect? If this declaration 
was in general what they wanted, 
why not postpone perfection for 
another day and pass this as it 
stands? “Honorable Chairman, I so 
move.” 

They passed it with a yell. Prof 
said, “Do I hear objection?” and 

THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



waited with gavel raised. A man 
who had been talking when Adam 
had asked to be heard said, “Well 
... I still say that’s a dangling par- 
ticiple, but okay, leave it in.” 

Prof banged gavel. “So ordered!” 
Then we filed up and put our 
chops on a big scroll that had been 
“sent over from Adam’s office” — 
and I noticed Adam’s chop on it. I 
signed right under Hazel — child 
now could write although was still 
short on book learning. Her chop 
was shaky but she wrote it large 
and proud. Comrade Clayton signed 
his party name, real name in letters, 
and Japanese chop, three little pic- 
tures one above other. Two com- 
rades chopped with X’s and had 
them witnessed. All Party leaders 
were there that night (morning), all 
chopped it, and not more than a 
dozen yammerers stuck. But those 
who did put their chops down for 
history to read. And thereby com- 
mitted “their lives, their fortunes, 
and their sacred honors.” 

While queue was moving slowly 
past and people were talking. Prof 
banged for attention. “I ask for vol- 
unteers for a dangerous mission. 
This Declaration will go on the news 
channels — but must be presented in 
person to the Federated Nations, on 
Terra.” 

T hat put stop to noise. Prof was 
looking at me. I swallowed and 
said, “I volunteer.” Wyoh echoed, 
“So do I!” — and little Hazel Meade 
said, “Me, too!” 

In moments were a dozen, from 
Finn Nielsen to Gospodin Dangling- 
Participle (turned out to be a good 

141 




cobber aside from his fetish). Prof 
took names, mumiured something 
about getting in touch as transpor- 
tation became available. 

I got Prof aside and said, “Look, 
Prof, you too tired to track? You 
know ship for seventh was can- 
celed; now they’re talking about 
slapping embargo on us. Next ship 
for Luna will be a warship.” 

“Oh, we won’t use their ships.” 
“So? Going to build one? Any 
idea how long that takes? If could 
build one at all. Which I doubt.” 
“Manuel, Mike says it’s neces- 
sary — and has it all worked out.” 
I did know Mike said was neces- 
sary; he had rerun problem soon as 
we learned that bright laddies at 
Richardson had snuck one home — 
He now gave us only one chance 
in fifty-three . with imperative 
need for Prof to go Earthside. But 
I’m not one to worry about impossi- 
bilities; I had spent day working to 
make that one chance in fifty-three 
turn up. 

“Mike will provide the ship,” Prof 
went on. “He has completed its de- 
sign and it is being worked on.” 
“He has? It is? Since when is 
Mike an engineer?” 

“Isn’t he?” asked Prof. 

I started to answer, shut up. Mike 
had no degrees. Simply knew more 
engineering than any man alive. Or 
about Shakespeare’s plays, or rid- 
dles, name it. “Tell me more.” 
“Manuel, we’ll go to Terra as a 
load of grain.” 

*^Whafl Who’s ‘we’?” 

“You and myself. The other vol- 
unteers are merely decorative.” 

I said, “Look, Prof. Fve stuck. 



Worked hard when whole thing 
seemed silly. Worn these weights — 
got ’em on now — on chance I 
might have to go to that dreadful 
place. But contracted to go in a 
ship, with at least a Cyborg pilot 
to help me get down safely. Did not 
agree to go as meteorite.” 

He said, “Very well, Manuel. 
I believe in free choice, always. Your 
alternative will go.” 

^'My—WhoT 

“Comrade Wyoming. So far as 
I know she is the only other per- 
son in training for the ship . 
other than a few Terrans.” 

S o I went. But talked to Mike 
first. 

He said patiently, “Man my first 
friend, there isn’t a thing to worry 
about. You are scheduled load 
KM 187 series ’76 and you’ll arrive 
in Bombay with no trouble. But to 
be sure — to reassure you — I select- 
ed that barge because it will be 
taken out of parking orbit and land- 
ed when India is faced toward me 
. and I’ve added an override 
so that I can take you away from 
ground control if I don’t like the 
way they handle you. Trust me, 
Man, it has all been thought 
through. Even the decision to con- 
tinue shipments when security was 
broken was part of this plan.” 
“Might have told me.” 

“There was no need to worry 
you. Professor had to know and 
Fve kept in touch with him. But 
you are going simply to take care 
<rf him and back Wm up — do his 
job if he dies, a factor on which I 
can give you no reassurance.” 



142 



IF 




I sighed. “Okay. But, Mike, sure- 
ly you don’t think you can pilot a 
Wge into a soft landing at this 
distance? Speed of light alone would 
trq) you.” 

“Man, don’t you think I under- 
stand ballistics? For the orbital 
position then, from query through 
reply and then to command-received 
is under four seconds . and you 
can rely on me not to waste micro- 
seconds. Your maximum parking- 
orbit travel in four seconds in only 
thirty-two kilometers, diminishing 
asymptotically to zero at landing. 
My reflex time will be effectively 
less than that of a human pilot in 
a manual landing because I don’t 
waste time grasping a situation and 
deciding on correct action. So my 
maximum is four seconds. But my 
effective reflex time is much less, 
as I project and predict constantly, 
see ahead, program it out — in 
effect, I’ll say four seconds ahead 
of you in your trajectory and re- 
spond instantly.” 

“That steel can doesn’t even have 
an altimeter!” 

“It does now. Man, please be- 
lieve me; I thought of everything. 
The only reason I’ve ordered this 
extra equipment is to reassure you. 
Poona ground control hasn’t made 
a bobble in the last five thousand 
loads. For a computer it’s fairly 
bright.” 

“Okay. Uh, Mike, how hard do 
they splash those bleeding barges? 
What gee?” 

“Not high, Man. Ten gravities 
at injection, then that programs down 
to a steady, soft four gees . 
then you’ll be nudged again between 

THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



six and five gees just before splash. 
The splash itself is gentle, equal 
to a fall of fifty meters and you 
enter ogive first with no sudden 
shock, less than three gees. Then 
you surface and splash again, light- 
ly, and simply float at one gee. 
Man, those barge shelb are built 
as lightly as possible for economy’s 
sake. We can’t afford to toss them 
around or they would split their 
seams.” 

“How sweet. Mike, what would 
‘six to five gees’ do to you? Split 
your seams?” 

“I conjecture that I was sub- 
jected to about six gravities when 
they shipped me up here. Six gravi- 
ties in my present condition would 
sheer many of my essential con- 
nections. However, Fm more in- 
terested in the extremely high, 
transient acceleration I am going to 
experience from shock waves when 
Terra starts bombing us. Data are 
insufficient for prediction . but 
I may lose control of my outlying 
functions, Man. This could be a 
major factor in any tactical situa- 
tion.” 

“Mike, you really think they are 
going to bomb us?” 

“Count on it, Man. That is why 
this trip is so important.” 

I eft it at that and went out to 
see this coffin. Should have 
stayed home. 

Ever looked at one of those silly 
barges? Just a steel cylinder with 
retro and guidance rockets and 
radar transponder. Resembles a 
spaceship way a pair of pliers re- 
sembles by number-three arm. They 

143 




had this one cut open and w«-e 
outfitting our “living quarters.** 

No galley. No. W.C. No nothing. 
Why bother? We were going to be 
in it only fifty hours. Start empty 
so that you won*t need a honey 
sack in your suit. Dispense with 
knmge and bar; you*ll never be out 
of your suit, you’ll be drugged and 
not caring. 

At least Prof would be drugged 
almost whole time; I had to be 
alert at landing to try to get us out 
of this death trap if something went 
wrong and nobody came along with 
a tin opener. They were building 
a shaped cradle in which backs of 
our p-suits would fit; we would be 
strapped into these holes. And stay 
there, clear to Terra. They seemed 
more concerned about making total 
mass equal to displaced wheat and 
same center of gravity and all 
moment arms adding up correctly 
than they did our comfort. Engineer 
in charge told me that even padding 
to be added inside our p-suits was 
figured in. 

Was glad to learn we were go- 
ing to have padding; those holes 
did not look soft. 

Returned home in thoughtful con- 
dition. 

W yoh was not at dinner, un- 
usual; Greg was, more un- 
usual. 

Nobody said anything about my 
being scheduled to imitate a fall- 
ing rock next day although all knew. 
But did not realize anything spe- 
cial was on until all next genera- 
tion left table without being told. 
Then knew why Greg had not gone 



back to Mare Undarum site after 
Congress adjourned that morning; 
somebody had asked for a Family 
talk-talk. 

Mum looked around and said, 
“We’re all here. Ali, shut that door; 
that’s a dear. Grandpaw, will you 
start us?” 

Our senior husband stopped nod- 
ding over coffee and firmed up. 
He looked down table and said 
strongly, “I see that we are all 
here. I see that children have been 
put to bed. I see that there is no 
stranger, no guest. I say that we 
are met in accordance with customs 
created by Black Jack Davis our 
First Husband and Tillie our First 
Wife. If there is any matter that con- 
cerns safety and happiness of our 
marriage, haul it out in the light 
now. Don’t let it fester. This is our 
custom.” 

Grandpaw turned to Mum and 
said softly, “Take it, Mimi,” and 
slumped back into gentle apathy. 
But for a minute he had been strong, 
handsome, virile, dynamic man of 
days of my opting . and I thought 
with sudden tears how lucky I had 
been! 

Then didn’t know whether I felt 
lucky or not. Only excuse I could 
see for a Family talk-talk was fact 
that I was due to be shipped Earth- 
side next day, labeled as grain. 
Could Mum be thinking of trying 
to set Family against it? Nobody 
had to abide by results of a talk- 
talk. But one always did. That was 
strength of our marriage; Wlien 
came down to issues, we stood to- 
gether. 

Mimi was saying, “Does anyone 



144 



IF 




luive anything that needs to be dis- 
cussed? Speak up, dears.” 

Greg said, “I have.” 

‘‘We’ll listen to Greg.” 

Greg is a good speaker. Can 
stand up in front of a congrega- 
tion and speak with confidence about 
matters I don’t feel confident about 
even when alone. But that night 
he seemed anything but sure of him- 
self. “Well, uh, we’ve always tried 
to keep this marriage in balance, 
some old, some young, a regular 
alternation, well spaced, just as it 
was handed down to us. But we’ve 
varied sometimes — for good rea- 
son.” He looked at Ludmilla. “And 
adjusted to it later.” He looked 
again at far end of table, at Frank 
and Ali, on each side of Ludmilla. 

“Over years, as you can see from 
records, average age of husbands has 
been about forty, wives about thirty- 
five — and that age spread was just 
what our marriage started with, 
nearly a hundred years gone by, 
for Tillie was fifteen when she 
opted Black Jack and he had just 
turned twenty. Right now I find 
the average age of husbands is 
almost exactly forty, while aver- 
age — ” 

Mum said firmly, “Never mind 
arithmetic, Greg dear. Simply state 
it.” 

I was trying to think who Greg 
could possibly mean. True, I had 
been much away during past year, 
and if did get home, was often after 
everybody was asleep. But he was 
clearly talking about marriage and 
nobody ever proposes another wed- 
ding in our marriage without first 
giving everybody a long careful 



diance to look prospect over You 
just didn’t do it any other way! 

So I’m stupid. Gred stuttered and 
said, “I propose Wyoming Knott!” 

I said I was stupid. I understand 
machinery and machinery under- 
stands me. But don’t claim to know 
anything about people. 

When I get to be senior husband, 
if live that long, am going to do 
exactly what Grandpaw does with 
Mum: Let Sidris run it. Just same 
— Well, look, Wyoh joined Greg’s 
church. I like Greg, love Greg. And 
admire him. But you could never 
feed theology of his church through 
a computer and get anything but 
null. Wyoh surely knew this, since 
she encountered it in adult years. 
Truthfully, I had suspected that 
Wyoh’s conversion was proof that 
she would do anything for our 
Cause. 

But Wyoh had recruited Greg 
even earlier. And had made most of 
trips out to new site, easier for her 
to get away than me or Prof. Oh, 
well. Was taken by surprise. Should 
not have been. 

Mimi said, “Greg, do you have 
reason to think that Wyoming would 
accept an opting from us?” 

“Yes.” 

“Very well. We all know Wyom- 
ing; I’m sure we’ve formed our 
opinions of her. I see no reason 
to discuss it . unless someone 
has something to say? Speak up.” 
Was no surprise to Mum. But 
wouldn’t be. Nor to anryone else, 
either, since Mum never let a talk- 
talk take place until she was sure 
of outcome. 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



145 




But wondered why Mum was 
sure of my opinion, so certain that 
she had not felt me out ahead of 
time? And sat there in a soggy quan- 
dary, knowing I should speak up, 
knowing I knew something terribly 
pertinent which nobody else knew 
or matter would never gone this 
far. Something that didn’t matter to 
me but would matter to Mum and 
all our women. 

Sat there, miserable coward, and 
said nothing. 

Mum said, “Very well. Let’s call 
the roll. Ludmilla?” 

“Me? Why, I love Wyoh, every- 
body knows that. Sure!” 

“Lenore dear?” 

“Well, I may try to talk her into 
going back to being a brownie 
again; I think we set each other off. 
But that’s her only fault, being 
blonder than I am. Dal” 

“Sidris?” 

“Thumbs up. Wyoh is our kind 
of people.” 

“Anna?” 

“Tve got something to say before 
I express my opinion, Mimi.” 

“I don’t think it’s necessary, 
dear.” 

“Nevertheless I’m going to haul 
it out in the open, just as Tillie al- 
ways did according to our tradi- 
tion. In this marriage every wife 
has carried her load, given children 
to the family. It may come as a 
surprise to some of you to learn 
that Wyoh has had eight chil- 
dren — ” 

^ertainly surprised Ali; his head 
v_>< head jerked and jaw dropped. 
I stared at plate. Oh. Wyoh, Wyoh! 



How could I let this happen? Was 
going to have to speak up. 

And realized Anna was still 
speaking; “ — so now she can have 
children of her own; the operation 
was successful. But she worries 
about possibility of another defec- 
tive baby, unlikely as that is accord- 
ing to the head of the clinic in 
Hong Kong. So we’ll just have to 
love her enough to make her quit 
fretting.” 

“We will love her,” Mum said 
serenely. “We do love her. Anna 
are you ready to express opinion?” 

“Hardly necessary, is it? I went 
to Hong Kong with her, held her 
hand while her tubes were restored. 
I opt Wyoh.” 

“In this family,” Mum went on, 
“we have always felt that our hus- 
bands should allowed a veto. Odd of 
us perhaps, but Tillie started it and 
it has always worked well. Well, 
Grandpaw?” 

“Eh? What were you saying, my 
dear?” 

“We are opting Wyoming, Gos- 
podin Grandpaw. Do you give con- 
sent?” 

“What? Why of course, of course! 
Very nice little girl. Say? Whatever 
became of that pretty little Afro, 
name something like that? She get 
mad at us?” 

“Greg?” 

‘T propose it.” 

“Manuel? Do you forbid this?” 

“Me? Why, you know me. Mum.” 

“I do. I sometimes wonder if yon 
know you. Hans?” 

“What would happen if I said 
NoT’ 

“You’d lose some teeth, thafs 

Vf 



146 




what,” Lenore said promptly. “Hans 
votes Yes.” 

“Stop it, darlings,” Mum said with 
•oft reproof. “Opting is a serious 
matter. Hans, speak up.” 

“Da. Yes. Ja. Oui. Si. High time 
we had a pretty blonde in this — 
Ouchr 

“Stop it, Lenore. Frank?” 

“Les, Mum.” 

“Ali dear? Is it unanimous?” 

Lad blushed bright pink and 
coudn’t talk. Nodded vigorously. 

Instead of appointing a husband 
and a wife to seek out selectee and 
propose opting for us. Mum sent 
Ludmilla and Anna to fetch Wyoh 
at once — ^turned out she was only 
as far away as Bon Ton. Nor was 
that only irregularity; instead of 
setting a date and arranging a wed- 
ding party, our children were called 
in, and twenty minutes later Greg 
had his Book open and we did be 
taking vows — and I finally got it 
through my confused head that was 
being done with breakneck speed 
because of my date to break my neck 
next day. 

N ot that it could matter save as 
symbol of my family’s love for 
me, since a bride spent her first 
night with her senior husband, and 
second and third I was going to 
spend out in space. But did matter 
anyhow and when women started 
to cry during ceremony, I found 
self dripping tears right with them. 



Then 1 went to bed, alone in work- 
shop, once Wyoh had kissed us and 
left on Grandpa w’s arm. Was ter- 
ribly tired and last two days had 
been hard. Thought about exercises 
and decided was too late to matter, 
thought about calling Mike and ask- 
ing for news from Terra. Went to 
bed. 

Don’t know how long had been 
asleep when realized was no longer 
asleep and somebody was in room. 
“Manuel?” came soft whisper in 
dark. 

“Huh? Wyoh, you aren’t supposed 
to be here, dear.” 

”I am indeed supposed to be here, 
my husband. Mum knows I’m here, 
so does Greg. And Grandpaw went 
right to sleep.” 

“Oh. What time is?” 

“About four hundred. Please, 
dear, may I come to bed?” 

“What? Oh, certainly.” Some- 
thing I should remember. Oh, yes. 
“Mike!” 

“Yes, Man?” he answered, right 
on cue. 

“Switch off. Don’t listen. If you 
want me, call me on Family phone.” 

“So Wyoh told me, Man. Congra- 
tulations!” 

Then her head was pillowed on 
my stump and I put right arm 
around her. “What are you crying 
about, Wyoh?” 

“I’m not crying! Pm just fright- 
ened silly that you won’t come 
backr

44T*m sure they saw us coming,” 

A the Alien Technologies Officer 
persisted. “Do you see that ring, 
sir?” 

The silvery image of the enemy 
ship almost filled the viewer. It 
showed as a broad, wide ring en- 
circling a cylindrical axis, like a 
mechanical pencil floating inside a 
platinum bracelet. A finned craft 
^ejected from the pointed end of 
tfie axial section. Angular letters ran 
down the axis, totally unlike the 
dots-and-commas of kzinti script. 

“Of course I see it,” said the Cap- 
tain. 

‘7t was rotating when we first 
picked them up. It stopped when we 
got within two hundred thousand 
miles, and it hasn’t moved since.” 

The Captain flicked his tail back 
and forth, gently, thoughtfully, like 
a pink lash. “You worry me,” he 
commented. “If they know we’re 
here, why haven’t they tried to get 



away? Are they so sure tfiey can 
beat us? He whirled to face the 
A-T Officer. “Should we be run- 
ning?” 

“No, sir! I don’t know why 
they’re still here, but they can’t have 
anything to be confident about. 
That’s one of the most primitive 
spacecraft I’ve ever seen.” He moved 
his claw about on the screen, point- 
ing as he talked. 

“The outer shell is an iron alloy. 
The rotating ring is a method of 
imitating gravity by using centri- 
petal force. So they don’t have the 
gravity planer. In fact they’re prob- 
ably using a reaction drive.” 

The Captain’s catlike ears went 
up. “But we’re light years from the 
nearest star!” 

‘They must have a better reaction 
drive than we ever developed. We 
had the gravity planer before w# 
needed one that good.” 

There was a buzzing sound from 



148 




the big control board. “Riter," said 
die captain. 

The Weapons Officer fell up 
through the entrance hatch and came 
to attention. “Sir, we have all 
weapons trained on the enemy.” 
“Good.” The Captain swung 
around. “A-T, how sure are you that 
they aren’t a threat to us?” 

The A-T Officer bared sharply 
pointed teeth. “I don’t see how they 
could be, sir.” 

44/^ood. Weapons, keep all your 
guns ready to fire, but don’t 
use them unless I give the order, 
ril have the ears of the man who 
destroys that ship without orders. I 
want to take it intact.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Where’s the Telepath?” 

“He’s on his way, sir. He was 
asleep.” 

“He’s always asleep. Tell him to 
get his tail up here.” 

The Weapons Officer saluted, 
turned, and dropped through the 
exit hole. 

“Captain?” 

The A-T Officer was standing by 
the viewer, which now showed the 
ringed end of the alien ship. He 
pointed to the mirror-bright end of 
the axial cylinder. “It looks like 
that end was designed to project 
light. That would make it a photon 
drive, sir.” 

The Captain considered. “Could it 
be a signal device?” 

“Urrrrr . Yes, sir.” 

“Then don’t jump to conclus- 
ions.” 

Like a piece of toast, the Tele- 
path popped up through the en- 



trance hatch. He came to exaggerat- 
ed attention. “Reporting as ordered, 

•_ H 

Sir. 

“You omitted to buzz for en- 
trance.” 

“Sorry, sir.” The lighted view- 
screen caught the Telepath’s eye and 
he padded over for a better look, 
forgetting that he was at attention. 
The A-T Officer winced, wishing he 
were somewhere else. 

The Telepath’s eyes were violet 
around the edges. His pink tail hung 
limp. As usual, he looked as if he 
were dying for lack of sleep. His 
fur was flattened along the side he 
slept on; he hadn’t even bothered 
to brush it. The effect was as far 
from the ideal of a Conquest War- 
rior as one can get and still be a 
member of the kzinti species. The 
wonder was that the Captain had not 
yet murdered him. 

He never would, of course. Tele- 
paths were too rare, too valuable, 
and — understandably — ^too emotion- 
ally unstable. The Captain always 
kept his temper with the Telepalh. 
At times like this it was the innocent 
bystander who stood to lose his 
rank or his ears at the clank of a 
falling molecule. 

“That’s an enemy ship we’ve 
tracked down,” the Captain was 
saying. “We’d like to get some infor- 
mation from them. Would you read 
their minds for us?” 

“Yes, sir.” The Telepath’s voice 
showed his instant misery, but he 
knew better than to protest. He left 
the screen and sank into a chair. 
Slowly his ears folded into tight 
knots, his pupils contracted, and his 
ratlike tail went limp as flannel. 



THE WARRIORS 



149 




The world of the eleventh sense 
pushed in on him. 

He caught the Captain’s thought: 

. sloppy civilian get of a sthon- 
dat ...” and frantically tuned it 
out. He hated the Captain’s mind. 
He found other minds aboard ship, 
isolated and blanked them out one 
by one. Now there were none left. 
TTaere was only unconsciousness and 
chaos. 

Chaos was not empty. Something 
was thinking strange and disturbing 
dioughts. 

The Telepath forced himself to 

fiaten. 

S teve Weaver floated bonelessly 
near a widl of the radio room. 
He was blond, blue eyed, and big, 
and he could often be seen as he 
was now, relaxed but completely 
motionless, as if there were some 
very good reason why he shouldn’t 
even blink. A streamer of smoke 
drifted from his left hand and cross- 
ed the room to bury itself in the 
air vent. 

“That’s that,” Ann Harrison said 
wearily. She flicked four switches 
in the bank of radio controls. At 
each click a small light went out. 
“You can’t get them?” 

“Right. I’ll bet they don’t even 
have a radio.” Ann released her 
chair net and stretched out into a 
five pointed star. “I’ve left the re- 
ceiver on, with the volume up, in 
case they try to get us later. Man, 
that feels good!” Abruptly she curl- 
ed into a tight ball. She had been 
crouched at the communications 
l»nk for more than an hour. Ann 
might have been Steve’s twin; she 



was almost as tall as he was, had 
the same color hair and eyes, and 
the flat muscles of conscientious ex- 
ercise showed beneath her blue fall- 
ing jumper as she flexed. 

Steve snapped his cigarette butt 
at the air conditioner, moving only 
his fingers. “Okay. What have they 
got?” 

Ann looked startled. “/ don’t 
know.” 

“Think of it as a puzzle. They 
don’t have radio. How might they 
talk to each other? How can we 
check on our guesses? We assume 
they’re trying to reach us, of 
course.” 

“Yes, of course.” 

“Think about it, Ann. Get Jim 
thinking about it, too.” Jim Davis 
was her husband that year, and the 
ship’s doctor full time. “You’re the 
girl most likely to succeed. Have a 
smog stick?” 

“Please.” 

Steve pushed his cigarette ration 
across the room. “Take a few. I’ve 
got to go.” 

The depleted package came whiz- 
zing back. “Thanks,” said Ann. 

“Let me know if anything hap- 
pens, will you? Or if you think of 
anything.” 

“I will. And fear not, Steve, some- 
thing’s bound to turn up. They must 
be trying just as hard as we are.” 

Every compartment in the per-- 
sonnel ring opened into the narrow 
doughnut-shaped hall which ran 
round the ring’s forward rim. Steve 
pushed himself into the hall, jockey- 
ed to contact the floor, and pushed. 
From there it was easy going. The 
floor curved up to meet him, and 



150

be proceeded down the hall like a 
•wimming frog. Of the twelve men 
ind women on the AngeVs Pencil, 
Steve was best at this; for Steve was 
a Belter, and the others were all 
flatlanders, Earthborn. 

A nn probably wouldn’t think of 
anything, he guessed. It wasn’t 
that she wasn’t intelligent. She didn’t 
have the curiosity, the sheer love of 
solving puzzles. Only he and Jim 
Davis — 

He was going too fast, and not 
concentrating. He almost crashed 
into Sue Bhang as she appeared be- 
low the curve of the ceiling. 

They managed to stop themselves 
against the walls. “Hi, jaywalker,” 
said Sue. 

“Hi, Sue. Where you headed?” 
“Radio room. You?” 

“I thought I’d check the drive 
systems again. Not that we’re likely 
to need the drive, but it can’t hurt 
to be certain.” 

“You’d go twitchy without some- 
thing to do, wouldn’t you?” She cock- 
ed her head to one side, as always 
when she had questions. “Steve, 
when are you going to rotate us 
again? I can’t seem to get used to 
falling.” 

But she looked like she’d been 
born falling, he thought. Her small, 
slender form was meant for flying; 
gravity should never have touched 
her. “When I’m sure we won’t need 
the drive. We might as well stay 
ready ’til then. Besides, I’m hoping 
you’ll change back to a skirt.” 

She laughed, pleased. “Then you 
can turn it off. I’m not changing, 
and we won’t be moving. Abel says 



the other ship did two hundred gee 
when it matched courses with us. 
How many can the Angel’s Pencil 
do?” 

Steve looked awed. “Just point 
zero five. And I was thinking of 
chasing them! Well, maybe we can 
be the ones to open communica- 
tions. I just came from the radio 
room, by the way. Ann can’t get 
anything.” 

“Too bad.” 

“We’ll just ha'.’c to wait.” 

“Steve, you’re always so impat- 
ient. Do Belters always move at a 
run? Come here.” She took a hand- 
hold and pulled him over to one 
of the thick windows which lined 
the forward side of the corridor. 
“There they are,” she said, pointing 
out. 

The star was both duller and 
larger than those around it. Among 
points which glowed arc-lamp blue- 
white with the Doppler shift, the 
alien ship showed as a dull red disc. 

“I looked at it through the tele- 
scope,” said Steve. “There are lumps 
and ridges all over it. And there’s 
a circle of green dots and commas 
painted on one side. Looked like 
writing.” 

“How long have we been waiting 
to meet them? Five hundred thous- 
and years? Well, there they are. Re- 
lax. They won’t go away.” Sue gazed 
out the window, her whole attention 
on the dull red circle, her gleaming 
jet hair floating out around her 
head. “TTie first aliens. I wonder 
what they’ll be like.” 

4 4Tt’s anyone’s guess. They must be 

J. pretty strong to take punish-

ment like that, unless they have 
some kind of acceleration shield, but 
free fall doesn’t bother them either. 
That ship isn’t designed to spin.” 
He was staring intently out at the 
stars, his big form characteristically 
motionless, his expression somber. 
He said, “Sue, I’m worried.” 

“About what?” 

‘Suppose they’re hostile?” 
“Hostile?” She tasted the unfamil- 
iar word, decided she didn’t like it. 

“After all, we know nothing about 
them. Suppose they want to fight? 
We’d—” 

She gasped. Steve flinched before 
the horror in her face. “What — 
what put that idea in your head?” 
“I’m sorry I shocked you. Sue.” 
“Oh, don’t worry about that, but 
why? Did — shh.” 

Jim Davis had come into view. 
The Angefs Pencil had left Earth 
when he was twenty-seven; now he 
was a slightly paunchy thirty-eight, 
the oldest man on board, an amiable 
man with abnormally long, delicate 
fingers. His grandfather, with the 
same hands, had been a world fa- 
mous surgeon. Nowadays surgery 
was normally done by autodocs, 
and the arachnodactils were to Da- 
vis merely an affliction. He bounced 
by, walking on magnetic sandals, 
looking like a comedian as he bob- 
bed about the magnetic plates. “Hi, 
group,” he called as he went by. 

“Hello, Jim.” Sue’s voice was 
strained. She waited until he was out 
of sight before she spoke again. 
Hoarsely she whispered, “Did you 
fight in the Belt?” She didn’t really 
believe it; it was merely the worst 
thing she could think of. 



Vehemently Steve snapped, “No! ’ 
Then, reluctantly, he added, “But 
it did happen occasionally.” Quickly 
he tried to explain. “The trouble was 
that all the doctors, including the 
psychists, were at the big bases, like 
Ceres. It was the only way they 
could help the people who needed 
them — be where the miners could 
find them. But all the danger was 
out in the rocks. 

“You noticed a habit of mine 
once. I never make gestures. All 
Belters have that trait. It’s because 
on a small mining ship you could 
hit something waving your arms 
around. Something like the airlock 
button.” 

“Sometimes it’s almost eery. You 
don’t move for minutes at a time.” 

“There’s always tension out in 
the rocks. Sometimes a miner would 
see too much danger and boredom 
and frustration, too much cramping 
inside and too much room outside, 
and he wouldn’t get to a psychist in 
time. He’d pick a fight in a bar. I 
saw it happen once. The guy was 
using his hands like mallets.” 

S teve had been looking far into 
the past. Now he turned back 
to Sue. She looked white and sick, 
like a novice nurse standing up to 
her first really bad case. His ears 
began to turn red. “Sorry,” he said 
miserably. 

She felt like running; she was as 
embarrassed as he was. Instead she 
said, and tried to mean it, “It doesn’t 
matter. So you think the people in 
the other ship might want to, uh, 
make war?” 

He nodded. 



T52 



IF 




*T)id you have history-of-Earth 
courses?** 

He smiled ruefully. “No, I couldn*t 
qualify. Sometimes I wonder how 
many people do.** 

“About one in twelve.** 

“That’s not many.** 

“People in general have trouble 
assimilating the facts of life about 
their ancestors. You probably know 
that there used to be wars before — 
hmmm — three hundred years ago, 
but do you know what a war is? 
Can you visualize one? Can you see 
a fusion electric plant deliberately 
built to explode in the middle of 
a dty. Do you know what a con- 
centration camp is? A limited action? 
You probably think murder ended 
with war. Well, it didn’t. The last 
murder occurred in twenty one 
something, just a hundred and sixty 
years ago. 

“Anyone who says human nature 
can’t be changed is out of his head. 
To make it stick, he’s got to define 
human nature — and he can’t. Three 
things gave us our present peaceful 
civilization, and each one was a 
technological change.” Sue’s voice 
had taken on a dry, remote lecture 
hall tone, like the voice on a teacher 
tape. “One was the development of 
psychistry beyond the alchemist 
stage. Another was the full develop- 
ment of land for food production. 
The third was the Fertility Restric- 
tion Laws and the annual contracep- 
tive shots. They gave us room to 
breathe. Maybe Belt mining and the 
stellar colonies had something to do 
with it too; they gave us an inani- 
mate enemy. Even the historians 
argue about that one. 



“Here’s the delicate point I’m 
trying to nail down.” She rapped 
on the window. “Look at that space- 
craft. It has enough power to move 
it around like a mail missile and 
enough fuel to move it up to our 
point eight light — rigjit?** 

“Right.” 

“ — with plenty of power left for 
maneuvering. It’s a better ship than 
ours. If they’ve had time to learn 
how the build a ship like that, 
they’ve had time to build up their 
own versions of psychistry, modern 
food production, contraception, eco- 
nomic theory, everything they need 
to abolish war. See?” 

Steve had to smile at her earnest- 
ness. “Sure, Sue, it makes sense. 
But that guy in the bar came from 
our culture, and he was hostile 
enough. If we can’t understand how 
he thinks, how can we guess about 
the mind of something whose very 
chemical makeup we can’t guess at 
yet?” 

“It’s sentient. It builds tools.” 
“Right.” 

“And if Jim hears you talking 
like this, you’ll be in psychistry 
treatment.” 

“That’s the best argument you’ve 
given me,” Steve grinned, 5nd strok- 
ed her under the ear with two 
fingertips. He felt her go suddenly 
stiff, saw the pain in her face; and 
at the same time, his own pain 
struck, a real tigw* of a headache, 
as if his brain were trying to swell 
beyond his skull. 

CCT’ve got them, sir,** the Tele- 
X path said blurr^. “Ask me 
anything.** 



THE WARRIORS 



153 




The Captain hurried, knowing 
that the Telepath couldn’t stand this 
for long. “How do they power their 
ship?*’ 

“It’s a light pressure drive power- 
ed by incomplete hydrogen fusion. 
They use an electromagnetic ram- 
scoop to get their own hy^ogen 
from space.” 

“Clever . Can they get away 
fr«n us?” 

“No. Their drive is on idle, ready 
to go, but it won’t help them. It’s 
pitifaHy weak.” 

“What kind of weapons do they 
have?” 

The Telepath remained silent for 
a long time. The others waited pa- 
tiently for his answer. There was 
sound in the control dome, but it 
was the kind of sound one learns 
not to hear: the whine of heavy 
current, the muted purr of voices 
from below, die strange sound like 
continuously ripping cloth which 
came from the gravity motors. 

“None at all, sir.” The kzinti’s 
voice became clearer; his hypnotic 
relaxation was broken by muscle 
twitches. He twisted as if in a night- 
mare. “Nothing aboard ship, not 
even a knife or a chib. Wait, they’ve 
got cooking knives. But that’s all 
they use them for. They don’t fight.” 

“They don’t fight?” 

“No, sir. They don’t expect us 
to fight, either. The idea has occur- 
red to three of them, and each has 
dismissed it from his mind.” 

“But why?” the Captain asked, 
knowing the question was irrelevant, 
unable to hold it back. 

“I don’t know, sir. It’s a science 
they use, or a religion. I don’t un- 



derstand,” the Telepath whimpered. 
“I don’t understand at all.” 

Which must be tough on him, the 
Captain thought. Completely ali«i 
thoughts . “What are they d(^g 
now?” 

“Waiting for us to talk to than. 
They tried to talk to us, and they 
think we must be trying just as 
hard.” 

“But why? Never mind, it’s not 
important. Can they be killed by 
heat?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Break contact.” 

The Telepath shook his head, vio- 
lently. He looked like he’d been in 
a washing machine. The Captain 
touched a sensitized surface and bel- 
lowed, “Weapons Officer!” 

“Here.” 

“Use the inductors on the enemy 
ship.” 

“But, sir! They’re so slow! What 
if the alien attacks?” 

“Dwi’t argue with me, you — ” 
Snarling, the Captain delivered an 
impassioned monologue on the vir- 
tues of unquestioning obedience. 
When he switched off, the Alien 
Technologies Officer was back at 
the viewer and the Telepath had 
gone to sleep. 

T he Captain purred happily, wish- 
ing that they were all this easy. 
When the occupants had been 
killed by heat he would take die 
ship. He could tell everything he 
needed to know about their planet 
by examining their life support sys- 
tem. He could locate it by tracing 
the ship’s trajectory. Probably they 
hadn’t even taken evasive action!

IF 




If they came from a Kzin-like 
world it would become a Kzin world. 
And he, as Conquest Leader, would 
command one percent of its wealth 
for the rest of his life! Truly, the 
future looked rich. No longer would 
he be called by his profession. He 
would bear a name . ; . 

“Incidental information,” said the 
A-T Officer. ‘The ship was generat- 
ing one and twelve sixty-fourths gee 
before it stopped rotating.” 

“Little heavy,” the Captain mus- 
ed. “Might be too much air, but it 
should be easy to kzinform it. A-T, 
we find the strangest life forms. Re- 
member the Chunquen?” 

“Both sexes were sentient. They 
fought constantly.” 

“And that funny religion on Al- 
tair One. They thought they could 
travel in time.” 

“Yes sir. When we landed the 
infantry they were all gone.” 
“They must have all committed 
suicide with disintegrators. But why? 
They knew we only wanted slaves. 
And I’m still trying to figure out 
where the disintegrators went.” 
“Some beings,” said the A-T Of- 
ficer, “will do anything to keep their 
beliefs.” 

E leven years beyond Pluto, eight 
years from her destination, the 
fourth colony ship We Made It fell 
between the stars. Before her the 
stars were green-white and blue- 
white, blazing points against nascent 
black. Behind they were sparse, dy- 
ing red embers. To the sides the 
constellations were strangely flatten- 
ed. The universe was shwter thaa 
it had been. 



For a while Jim Davis was very 
busy. Everyone, including himself, 
had a throbbing blinding headache. 
To each patient Doctor Davis hand- 
ed a tiny pink pill from the dispen- 
ser slot of the huge autodoc which 
covered the back wall of the infir- 
mary. They milled outside the door 
waiting for the pills to take effect, 
looking like a full-fledged mob in 
the narrow corridor; and then some- 
one thought it would be a good idea 
to go to the lounge, and everyone 
followed him. It was an unusually 
silent mob. Nobody felt like talking 
while the pain was with them. Even 
the sound of magnetic sandals was 
lost in the plastic pile rug. 

Steve saw Jim Davis behind him. 
“Hey, Doc,” he called softly. “How 
long before the pain stops?” 

“Mine’s going away. You got your 
pills a little after I did, right?” 
“Right. Thanks, Doc.” 

They didn’t take pain well, these 
people. They were too unused to it. 

In single file they walked or float- 
ed into the lounge. Low-fMtched con- 
versations started. People took 
couches, using the sticky plastic 
strips on their falling jumpers. Others 
stood or floated near walls. The 
lounge was big enough for all. 

Steve wriggled near the cdling, 
trying to pull on his sandals. 

“I hope they don’t try that a^in,” 
he heard Sue say. “It hurt.” 

“Try what?” Someone Steve didn’t 
recognize, half-listening as he was. 

“Whatever they tried. Telepathy, 
perhaps.” 

“No. I don’t believe in telepathy. 
Could they have set up ultrasonic 
vibrations in the walls?” 



THE WARRIORS 



155 




Steve has his sandals on. He left 
the magnets turned off. 

"... a cold beer. Do you realize 
^^e’ll never taste beer again?” Jim 
Davis’ voice. 

“I miss waterskiiing.” Ann Harri- 
son sounded wistful. “The feel of 
a pusher unit shoving into the small 
of your back, the water beating 
against your feet, the sun . .** 

Steve pushed himself toward them. 
‘Taboo subject,” he called. 

“We’re on it anyway,” Jim boom- 
ed cheerfully. ‘TJnless you’d rather 
talk about the alien, which everyone 
else is doing. Td rather drop it for 
the moment Wl»t*8 your greatest 
regrrt at leaving Earth?” 

Ci/^nly that I didn’t stay long 
enough to really see it.” 

“Oh, of course.” Jim suddenly re- 
membered the drinking bulb in his 
hand. He drank from it, hospitably 
passed it to Steve. 

“This waiting makes me restless,” 
said Steve. “What are they likely to 
try next? %ake the ship in M<me 
code?” 

Jim smiled. “Maybe they w«a*t 
try anything next. They may give 
up and leave.” 

“Oh, I h<^ not!” said Ann. 
“Would that be so bad?” 

Steve hid a start. What was Jim 
thinking? 

“Of course!” Ann protested. 
“We’ve got to find out what they're 
like! And think of what fiiey can 
teach us, Jim!” 

When conversation got c<mtrover- 
sial it was good manners to change 
the subject. “Say," said Steve, “I 
happened to notice the wall was 



warm when I pushed off. Is that 
good or bad?” 

“That’s funny. It should be cold, 
if anything,” said Jim. “There’s no- 
thing out there but starlight. Ex- 
cept — ” A most peculiar expression 
flitted across his face. He drew his 
feet up and touched the magnetic 
soles with his fingertips. 

“Eeeee! Jim! Jim!” 

Steve tried to whirl around and 
got nowhere. That was Sue. He 
switched on his shoes, thumped to 
the floor, and went to help. 

Sue was surrounded by bewildered 
people. They split to let Jim Davis 
through, and he tried to lead her out 
of the lounge. He looked frightened. 
Sue was moaning and thrashing, pay- 
ing no attention to his efforts. 

Steve pushed through to her. “All 
the metal is heating up,” Davis 
shouted. “We’ve got to get her hear- 
ing aid out.” 

“Infirmary,” Steve shouted. 

Four of ^em took Sue down the 
hall to the infirmary. She was still 
crying and struggling feebly when 
diey g(^ her in, but Jim was there 
ahead of them with a spray hypo. 
He used it and she went to sleep. 

The four watched anxiously as 
Jim went to work. The autodoc 
would have taken precious time for 
diagnosis. Jim operated by hand. He 
was able to do a fast job, for the 
tiny instrument was buried just be- 
low the skin behind her ear. Still, 
the scalpel must have burned his 
fingers befcM'e he was done. Steve 
could feel the growing warmth 
against tibe soles of his feet. 

Did the aliens know what they 
were doing? 




EHd it matter? The ship was being 
attacked. His ship. 

Steve slipped into the corridor and 
ran for the control room. Running 
on magnetic soles, he looked like a 
torified penguin, but he moved fast. 
He knew he might be making a ter- 
rible mistake; the aliens might be 
trying desperately to reach the An- 
geVs Pencil; he would never know. 
They had to be stopped before ev- 
eryone was roasted. 

The shoes burned his feet. He 
whimpered with the pain, but other- 
wise ignored it. The air burned in 
his mouth and throat. Even his 
teeth were hot. 

He had to wrap his shirt around 
his hands to open the control room 
door. The pain in his feet was un- 
bearable; he tore off his sandals and 
swam to the control board. He kept 
his shirt over his hands to work the 
controls. A twist of a large white 
knob turned the drive on full, and 
he slipped into the pilot seat before 
the gentle light pressure could build 
up. 

He turned to the rear view tele- 
scope. It was aimed at the Solar 
system, for the drive could be used 
for messages at this distance. He 
set it for short range and began to 
turn the ship. 

T he enemy ship glowed in the 
high infrared. 

“It will take longer to heat the 
crew carrying section,” reported the 
Alien Technologies Officer. “They’ll 
have temperature control there.” 
“That’s all right. When you think 
they should all be dead, wake up 
the Telepath and have him check.” 



The Captain continued to brush his 
fur, killing time. “You know, if 
they hadn’t been so completely help- 
less I wouldn’t have tried this slow 
method. I’d have cut the ring free 
of the motor section first. Maybe I 
should have done that anyway. Saf- 
er.” 

The A-T Officer wanted afl the 
credit he coukl get. “Sir, tiiey 
couldn’t have any big weapons. Thwe 
isn’t room. With a reaction drive, the 
motor and the fuel tanks take up 
most of the available space.** 

The other ship began to turn 
away from its tormentor. Its drive 
end glowed red. 

“They’re trying to get away,** the 
Captain said, as the glowing end 
swung toward them.” “Are you sure 
they can’t?” 

“Yes sir. That light drive won’t 
take them anywhere.” 

The Captain purred thoughtfully. 
“What would happen if the light hit 
our ship?” 

“Just a bright light, I think. The 
lens is flat, so it must be emitting 
a very wide beam. They’d need a 
parabolic reflector to be dangerous. 
Unless — ” His ears went straight up. 

“Unless what?” The Captain spoke 
softly, demandingly. 

“A laser. But that’s all right, sir. 
They don’t have any weapons.” 

The Captain sprang at the control 
board. “Stupid!” he spat. “They 
don’t know weapons from sthondat 
blood. Weapons Officer! How could 
a telepath find out what they don’t 
know? WEAPONS OFFICER!” 

“Here, sir.” 

“Burn—” 

An awful light shone in the con-

trol dome. The Captain burst into 
flame, then blew out as the air left 
through a glowing split in the dome. 

Steve was lying on his back. The 
ship was spinning again, pressing 
him into what felt like his own 
bunk. 

He opened his eyes. 

Jim Davis crossed the room and 
stood over him. “You awake?” 

Steve sat bolt upright, his eyes 
wide. 

“Easy.” Jim’s gray eyes were con- 
cerned. 

Steve blinked up at him, “What 
happened?” he asked, and discover- 
ed how hoarse he was. 

J im sat down in one of the chairs. 

“You tell me. We tried to get 
to the control room when the ship 
started moving. Why didn’t you ring 
the strap-down? You turned off the 
drive just as Ann came through the 
door. Then you fainted.” 

“How about the other ship?” Steve 
tried to repress the urgency in his 
voice, and couldn’t. 

“Some of the others are over 
there now, examining the wreck- 
age.” Steve felt his heart stop. ‘1 
guess I was afraid from the start 
that alien ship was dangerous. I’m 
more psychist than emdee, and I 
qualified for history class, so maybe 
I know more than is good for me 
about human nature. Too much to 
think that beings with space travel 
will automatically be peaceful. I 
tried to think ro, but they aren’t. 
They’ve got tilings any self respect- 
ing human being woidd be ashamed 
to have ra^itmares about. Bomb 
missiles, faskm bombs, lasers, that 



induction projector they used on us. 
And antimissiles. You know what 
that means? They’ve got enemies like 
tiiemselves, Steve. Maybe nearby.” 
“So I killed them.” The room 
seemed to swoop around him, but 
his voice came out miraculously 
steady. 

“You saved the ship.” 

“It was an accident. I was trying 
to get us away.” 

“No, you weren’t.” Davis’ accusa- 
tion was as casual as if he were 
describing the chemical makeup of 
urea. “That ship was four hundred 
miles away. You would have had to 
sight on it with a telescope to hit 
it. You knew what you were doing, 
too, because you turned off the 
drive as soon as you’d burned 
through the ship.” 

Steve’s back muscles would no 
longer support him. He flopped back 
to horizontal. “AD right, you know,” 
he told the ceiling. “Do the others?” 
“I doubt it. Killing in self defense 
is too far outside thdr experience. I 
think Sue’s guessed.” 

“Oooo.” 

“If she has, she’s taking it well,” 
Dave said briskly. “Better than most 
of tibem will, when they find out the 
universe is full of warriors. This is 
the end of the world, Steve.” 
“What?” 

‘Tm being theatrical. But it is. 
Three hundred years of the peaceful 
Kfe for everyone. TTiey’D call it the 
Golden Age. No starvation, no war, 
no physical sickness other than sen- 
escence, no permanent mental sick- 
ness at all, even by our rigid stand- 
ards. When someone over fourteen 
hies to use his fist on someone else

we say he’s sick, and we cure him. 
And now it’s over. Peace isn’t a 
stable condition, not for us. Maybe 
not for anything that lives.” 

“Can I see the ship from here?” 
“Yes. It’s just behind us.” 

Steve rolled out of bed, went to 
the window. 

Someone had steered the ships 
much closer together. The kzinti 
diip was a huge red sphere with ugly 
projections scattered at seeming ran- 
dom over the hull. The beam had 
sliced it into two unequal halves, 
sliced it like an ax through an egg. 
Steve watched, unable to turn aside. 



as the big half rotated to show its 
honey-combed interior. 

“In a little while,” said Jim, “the 
men will be coming back. They’ll 
be frightened. Someone will prob- 
ably insist that we arm ourselves 
against the next attack, using wea- 
pons from the other ship. I’ll have 
to agree with him. 

“Maybe they’ll think I’m sick my- 
self. Maybe I am. But it’s the kind 
of sickness we’ll need.” Jim looked 
desperately unhappy. “We’re going 
to become an armed society. And of 
course we’ll have to warn the 
Earth . .” END

Dear Editor: 

It*s my tnm to cheer. For the 
past five months I*ve been tossing 
four-bit pieces on the newsstand 
for If, hoping first that Skylark 
DuQuesne would show a resurrec- 
tion of the old E. E. Smith, then 
that each installment would hold 
up to the promise of the one be- 
fore. Today, having finished it and 
going back to re-read the last few 
chapters, because I skimmed a bit 
in utter excitement, I bless you a 
mighty blessing, and pray that I’ll 
wind up in the same Next World 
with EES, so I can read the fifth 
Skylark novel. 

In short, you have restored my 
youth in the best way possible — 
just enough to enjoy it, without all 
the bother of actually having to 
be young again. I kid thee not; 
I haven’t had so much fun reading 
science fiction since 1934 ! — Rob- 
ert A. W. Lowndes.

Dear Editor: 

Your story Under Two Moons 
was an extremely superb piece of 
sf, a splendid style of writing. Your 
fictional character, Johann Gull, 
was a very exciting and James 
Bondish type person. I would like 



very much to read some more stories 
centering on him as the main char- 
acter. — Mark Lydall, 824 Soutti 
8th Street, Corvallis, Oregon. 

# Thanks — but no sequels are 
planned. — Editor.

Dear Editor: 

Reserve a seat for me on the 
“// is the Most Improved and Best 
Magazine” bandwagon. With stories 
by E. E. Smith and Larry Niv«n 
(you were justified in saying that 
he is a promising writer in your 
introduction of him). If is on top 
. even though you’re forced to fill 
in issues with stories by Clement 
and Heinlein ! 

For a reader to fully enjoy stor- 
ies of a series involving one char- 
acter of idea, he should be made 
aware of the fact — especially when 
the stories are at long and/or irreg- 
ular intervals. For instance, the May 
1966 ish continued Saberhagen’s 
Sign of the Wolf, the sixth (five in 
If) of his fine and ingenious stories 
about the life-dueling “Berserker” 
machines. The June and April 
issues had two MacApp tales of 
Steve Duke’s assignments against 
the Gree, but the first of the three 
stories was way back in the August

19S4 copy. Wily not mention this 
sort of thing^ in the introdnction? 

The June Hue & Cry carried two 
requests for story locations. Dave 
Lyon wanted to find a story about 
a boy who escapes from the domes- 
ticate to the wild humans and 
blasts off in a starship. The only 
one that I know of had a different 
title and was a novelette: The Silk 
amd the Song by Charles L. Fon- 
tenay in the July, 1956, F&SF. (No, 
Virginia, If doesn’t have a complete 
monopoly on stirring stories!) 

James McLean inquired about a 
plot which had a man (in tomor- 
row’s nerve-numbing world of end- 
less commercial barrages) con his 
wife out of enough money to enter 
**Para®se” — a soundproof haven of 
quiet. 'The closest I could come was 
a story in which it was the wife who 
soaked her husband for $84,000 in 
the same way: Year Day by Henry 
Kuttner, in his collection Ahead of 
Time, published by Ballantine. A 
salute to Fred 'Pohl, one of the best 
at either end of a typewriter— al- 
though I wish that the editor would 
Include more of the writer’s work. — 
Bruce MacPhee, 38 Lenox Avenue, 
Norwalk, Connecticut 06864. 

# Our rule about series stories is: 
Every story has to stand on its own 
merits, no that if you’ve never read 
anything that went before it in the 
series you’ll still be able to under- 
stand it and enjoy it. So we’ve ne’ver 
felt it necessary to say ansrthing 
about the series status of a story in 
the introduction. — Editor.

Dear Editor: 

Senator Robert Kennedy has re- 
cently said there is a great danger 
that nuclear weapons will spread 
beyond control. 

Would it be possible for you to 



do an article on this in our maga- 
zine? — H. DeVries, 220 Fulton 
Street, New York 7, New York.

fiction any more — unfortunately. 
The senator is clearly right — Edi-

Etear Editor: 

The trouble with American 
science-fiction television is undoubt- 
edly caused by the great sdekness 
that American TV had fallen into, 
but that’s not exactly the root cauact. 
It seems quite clear that it was ti» 
Grade Z horror movies from the 
late fifties that have done all the 
damage. These films are what 
Outer Limits identified with, espec- 
ially in its first season. I fear this 
kind of thing is much too juvenile 
— Whence adults don’t watch — hence 
low ratings. 

So — maybe there are people in 
Hollywood who are aware of con- 
temporary science fiction. Any exec- 
utive producers among them? The 
great dearth of name Sf writers con- 
nected with films or TV is just as 
great as it ever was. 

The greatest sadness comes to me 
these days whenever I watch sf on 
the white clown. Whatever hap- 
pmed to futuristic video sf? TV 
can do it, I know; remember Tales 
of Tomorrow, Out There, Playhouse 
90 and the excellent production of 
Alfred Bester’s Fondly Fahrenheit, 
Murder and the Android. Even the 
old juves like Tom Corbett and 
Space Patrol had more science fic- 
tion in them than a dozen episodes 
of Twilight Zone, which had very 
little futuristic science fiction, but 
always the Great Big Moral. 

Memories! ... Is that all we 
ever will have? Or maybe it’s im- 
possible to dramatiTC good science

Dear Editor: 

When I read Keitib Laumer^s 
Embassy, I noticed something you 
didn't mention in your note on it in 
the July If. At the end of the book, 
American diplomat Brion Bayard 
is recuperating in Stockholm. 
Laumer's sf novel, Wol-lds of the 
Imperitan, begins with the hero, an 
American diplomat named Brion 
Bayard, being kidnapped from 
Stockhohn and transported into al- 
ternate worlds. In Embassy Bay- 
ard baa a Swedish fiancee named 
Ingred ; she isn't mentioned in 
Worlds sf the Imperium, although 
Bayard acquires another Swedish 
girl friend, Barbro. This Bayard 
fellow sure gets around! 

By the way, is it just coincidence 
that "Better' is "fighter" spelled 
backwards phonetically? In a sense. 
Embassy is the Retief stories in- 
side out. Retief is successful by 
being forthright and courageous. In 
Embassy, Bayard behaves in the 
same way and gets the tar knocked 
out of him for his trouble. I am 
ufraid that Embassy is the more 
realistic.— George W. Price, 878 
Cornelia Avenue, Chicago 57, Illi- 
nois. 

• For late-comers. Embassy is 
Keith Laumer's non-science-fiction 
novel about diplomacy in a South- 
east Asian country that looks sort 
of like Vietnam to some observers 
— though Keith Laumer never says 
so. As to the questions — what about 
it, Keith? Care to elucidate for our 
readers? — Editor,

Dear Editor: 

I just took what opportunity I 



had to reread a few of the many 
sf magazines I have managed to 
collect since 1960. Besides adding a 
little perspective to my sf sight, 
it was downright enjoyable. If has 
improved to a point that I wouldn't 
have believed possible five years 
ago. Since 1962 you have published 
a couple of stories that will rank 
with m” All Time Favorites — 
Kings Who Die by Poul Anderson 
being the best of the lot, with your 
own Fiv '■ Hells of Orion not far 
behind. Galaxy too has come a long 
ways. Vive le Cordwainer Smith! 

It's nice to see that Robert 4. 
Heinlein hasn't forgotten the words 
of wisdom he addressed to r.s at 
the Seacon back in 1962. In Fam- 
ham*8 Freehold they were no less 
pertinent for being (if possible) 
more entertaining. My apologies to 
E. E. Smith for doubting his ability 
to write anything but balderdash 
I can't wait to hear more of the 
d'Alemberts. The Imperial Stars, 
The SUkie, Famham's Freehold, 
Laumer's The Night of the Trolls 
and now The Hounds of Hell — hoo, 
boy! Now what’s Judy Merril got 
to say about magazine sf ? — Ken 
Winkes, 433 South McLeod, Arling- 
ton, Washington. 

# That's about it again, friends. 
Our "First" for the issue is Steve 
Buchanan's The Kettle Black — a 
good beginning, we'd say, and hope 
to see more from this 21-year-old 
pre-med student from Little Rock, 
Arkansas. 

Next month? Well, for openers 
there's a complete short novel by 
John Brunner — The Long Way to 
Earth; more Heinlein; a very fun- 
ny new Retief novelette — well, see 
for yourself!
