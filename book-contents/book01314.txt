“Your $1,200.00 check arrived this morning by Speciai 
Delivery. Thanks ever so much for your telephone call and 
prompt payment. It still doesn’t seem possible. It's been a 
great thrill." 

That's the way Emory Mead of Albany, N. Y., just one of 
our many big winners, reacted to receiving his cash prize. 
Dozens of men and women of all ages have cashed in as 
members of our exciting PUZZLE LOVERS CLUB. 

Our Club winners got their cash awards for solving 
puzzles in their leisure time. Our Club also has awarded 
huge prizes for many other kinds of contests. 



We’ve awarded cash in hundred-and-thousand-dollar units 
to retirees, sewing women, farmers, salesmen, war vet- 
erans, office workers, clerks, secretaries — people who 
never before dreamed of having the kind of money that 
movie stars make. 

This announcement is an invitation to you, as a reader

EDWARD E. SMITH, Ph.D. 



At the beginning of September in this year we were in London. The World 
Science Fiction Convention had just ended. Late that night there was a phone 
call from a cable office, and the voice said: ''We have some bad news from 
the United States for Frederik Pohl.'' He then read the coble, and it was bod 
news indeed: Edward E. Smith, Ph.D., hod died of a heart attack that morning. 

Bad news. Science fiction had lost one of its few remaining links 
with those exciting days of the 20s and early 30s, when it was all so new 
and different. And a large number of us have lost a cherished friend. 



T he first story Doc Smith ever 
published, like the last that 
appeared in his lifetime, concerned 
the adventures of Richard Ballin- 
gei' Seaton and his Skylarkers. The 
Skylark of Space appeared in 1928 
(but Doc had be£Tun writing it ten 
years earlier. At that time there 
was no magazine that would pub- 
lish it, but Doc waited his time and 
when the first science-fiction mag- 



azine appeared he was ready.) 
Skylark DuQuesne was still on the 
newsstands on the day of his death. 

Doc's Skylarks were powered by 
atomic energy — and what a dar- 
ing concept that seemed in 1928! 
Yet he lived to see Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki destroyed by larger ver- 
sions of his X-plosive shells, and 
if we have not yet seen his Ber- 
genholm drive generators for in-

ter^ralactie sliip«» or a meetincr with 
his Arisiaas . diere's still time. 
But what was central to Doc's stor- 
ies — besides the color and the ad- 
venture and the itiieer 8tX€ of his 
ideas — was the fact that his char- 
acters used technology as a tool. 
Science didn't scare them. They 
' re on top of it at every step. 
1 liven the mightiest forces to com- 
n?and that any science-fiction writ- 
er ever dreamed, they studied them, 
and used them, and learned to live 
with them. In that Doc probably 
has a far better chance of being 
right than the multitudinous pro- 
phets of decay who see a future 
of machine-tended lotos-eaters . 
or machine-ruled slaves. 

The Skylark of Space, Skylark 
Three, The Skylark of VeUeron 
and Skylark DuQuesne were only 
four of his books; there were also 
the Lensmen stories, and the others 
that fit no special framework. 
There may yet be one or two more, 
since Doc was working on not one 
new story but three when he died 
(one of them a sequel to The Im- 
perial Stars, which appeared here 
last year.) In all of them there is 
an interplay of cultures ... a meet- 
ing of intelligent races from this 
planet or that; a cross-fertilization 
and growth. 

Since Doc was a chemist by trade 
for most of his life, the concept 
of synergy was familiar to him. 
Perhaps he never thought of it in 
those terms, but the hybridization 
of cultures can be described as a 
synergistic reaction, one in which 
the effects of each are rendered far 
more potent in combination with 
the other; and likely there too Doc 
will prove a true prophet. 

Like Columbus's egg — this seems 
Ifre a fairly commonplace idea now, 



when every science-fiction miiga- 
sine contains stories about visiting 
other stars and the confrontations 
between Earthmen and aliens. WeH 
it is commonplace enough — sinoa 
Doc thought of it. But he was tha 
first. 

No one else had sent his story 
characters racing into the unknown 
worlds of the galaxies to meet and 
learn from — or to battle — stranga 
peoples and new forms of science. 
Doc showed the rest of us the way; 
and now has gone to see them for 
himself. 

A few days after Doc Smith's 
death, in Boston, the local 
science-fiction group put on tha 
first annual ‘^Boskone”. 

One of their speakers was a man 
named Robert Enzmann who is 
actually in the business of building 
spaceships — real spaceships ; by 
which we mean to say that they 
are the sort of spaceships you and 
we and Doc Smith were interested 
in, that might just take us out as 
far as Osnome one day. (They are 
not yet real in the sense of being 
ready for boarding by passengers, 
but Enzmann's estimate is that 
that day is no more than twenty, 
and perhaps as little as five, years 
away. ) 

It was announced that the Bos- 
kone had made a decision to give 
a trophy each year for general ex- 
cellence in science fiction. They 
looked for a name for it and came 
up with the one right and obvious 
choice ; so next year, and every 
year thereafter, there will be a Doe 
Smith award made in Boston. 

We don^ know who will be te 
first recipient, in 1966, but who- 
ever gets it will be an honored nMOL

Watson before he founded IBM. 
This story oharactM* would just sit 
and think — and that's what Mike 
did. Mike was a fair dinkum think- 
um, sharpest computer you’ll ever 
meeit 

Not fastest. At Bell Labs, Buenos 
Aires, down Earthside, they’ve got 
a thinkum a tenth his size which 
can answer almost before you ask. 
But matters whether you get answer 
in microsecond rather than millisec- 
ond as long as correct? 

Not that Mike would necessarily 
give right answer; he wasn’t com- 
pletely honest. 

When Mike was installed in Luna, 
he was pure thinkum, a flexible 
logic — “High-Optional, Logical, 
Multi-Evaluating Supervisor, Mark 
IV, Mod. L” — a HOLMES FOLIR. 
He computed ballistics for pilotless 
freighters and controlled their cata- 
pult. This kept him busy less than 
one percent of time and Lunar Au- 
thority never believed in idle hands. 
They kept hooking hardware into 
him — decision-action boxes to let 
him boss other computers, bank on 
bank of additional memories, more 
banks of associational neural nets, 
another tubful of twdve-digit raiH 
dom numbers, a greatly augmented 
temporary memory. Human brain 
has around ten-to-the-tenth neurons. 
By third year Mike had better than 
one and a half times thfSt number 
of neuristors. 

And woke up. •

A human? Don’t know about you,

along evolutionary diain from mao-

sert it happens automatically when- 
ever a brain acquires certain very 
high number of associational paths. 
Can’t see it matters whether padie 
are protein or platinum. 

(“Soul”? Does a dog have a 
soul? How about cockroach?) 

Remember Mike was desi^ied, 
even before augmented, to answ^'r 
questions tentatively on insuffidc t 
data like you do; that’s “high op- 
tkmai” and “muki-evaluating” part 
(rf name. So Mike started with “free 
will” and acquired more as he was 
added to and as he learned — and 
don’t ask me to define “free will.* 
If comforts you to think of Mike 
as simply tossing random numbers 
in air and switching circuits to 
match, please do. 

By then Mike had voder-voco- 
der cheuits supplementing his read- 
outs, print-oirts, and decision-action 
boxes, and could understand not only 
classic programming but also Log- 
km and Engli^, and could accept 
other languages and was doing tech- 
nical translating — and reading 
endlessly. But in giving him in- 
structions was safer to use Loglan. 
If you spoke En^ish, results might 
be whimsical; midti-valued nature 
of English gave optkm circuits too 
much leeway. 

And Mike took on endless new 
jobs, hi May 2075 besides controft- 
ing robot traffic and catapult and

Ipolfted f^one system for all Luna, 
Mine for Luna-Terra voice & video, 
huidM air, water temperature 
Inmidky, and sewage for Luna City, 
Novy Leningrad, and several smaller 
wrens (not Hong Kong in Luna), 
did aocousting and payrolls for 
Limair Auiiorky, and, by lease, same 
for many films and banks. 

Some logics get nervous break- 
downs. Overloaded phone system be- 
baves like frightened child. Mike 
did not have upsets, acquired sense 
of humor instead. Low one. If he 
were a man, you wouldn’t dare 
stoop over. His idea of thigh-slapper 
would be to dump you out of bed 
— or put itch powder in pressure 
suh. 

Not being equipped for that Mike 
indulged in phony answers with 
skewed logic, or pranks like issuing 
pay cheque to a janitor in Authori- 
ty’s Luna City office for AS $10,- 
000,000,000,000,185.15 — last five 
digits being correct amount. Just a 
great big overgrown loveable kid 
who ought to be kicked. 

H e did that first week in May 
and I had to trouWeshoot. I 
was private contractor, not on Au- 
thority’s payroll. You sec — or per- 
haps not; tkn^ have changed. Back 
in bad old days many a con served 
his time, then went on working for 
Authority in same job, happy to 
draw wages. But I was born free. 

Makes difference. My one grand- 
father was shipped up from Joburg 
for armed violence and no work per- 
mit, other got transported for sub- 



versive activity after Wet Firecracker 
War. Maternal grandmother claim- 
ed she came up in bride ship — 
but I’ve seen records; she was Peace 
Corps enrollee (involuntary), which 
means what you think: juvenile de- 
linquency, female type. As she was 
in early clan marriage (Stone Gang) 
and shared six husbands with an- 
other woman, identity of maternal 
grandfather open to question. But 
was often so and I’m content with 
grandpappy she picked. Other 
grandmother was Tatar, born near 
Samarkand, sentenced to “re-edu- 
cation” on Oktyabrskaya Revolyu- 
tsiya, then “volunteered” to colonize 
in Luna. 

My old man claimed we had even 
longer distinguished line — ancestr- 
ess hanged in Salem for witch- 
craft, a gg’g’great grandfather 
broken on wheel for piracy, another 
ancestress in first shipload to Bo- 
tany Bay. 

Proud of my ancestry and while 
I did business with Warden, would 
never go on his payroll. Perhaps 
distinction seems trivial since I was 
Mike’s valet from day he was un- 
packed. But mattered to me. I could 
down tools and tdl them go to hell. 

Besides, private contractor paid 
more than civil service rating with 
Audiority. Computermen scarce. 
How many Loonies could go Earth- 
side and stay out of hospital long 
enough for computer school? — 
even if didn’t die. 

I’ll name one. Me. Had been down 
twice, once three months, once four, 
and got schooling. But meant harsh 
training, exercising in centrifuge, 
wearing weights even in bed. Then

I took no chances on Terra, never 
hurried, never climbed stairs, nodd- 
ing that could strain heart. Women 

— didn’t even think about women; 
in that gravitational field no effort 
not to. 

But most Loonies never tried to 
leave The Rock — too risky for 
any bloke who’d been in Luna more 
than weeks. Computermen sent up 
to install Mike were on short-term 
bonus contracts. Get job done fast 
before irreversible physiological 
change marooned them four hundred 
thousand kilometers from home. 

But despite two training tours I 
was not gung-ho computerman; 
higher maths are beyond me. N<rt 
really electronics engineer, nor phy- 
sicist. May not have been best mi- 
cromachinist in Luna and certairfy 
wasn’t cybernetics psychologist. 

But I knew more about all these 
than a specialist knows. I’m general 
specialist. Coidd relieve a cook and 
keep orders coming or field-repair 
your suit and get you back to air- 
lock still breathing. Machines like 
me and I have something specialists 
don’t have: my left arm. 

You sec, from elbow down I 
don’t have one. So I have a dozen 
left arms, each specialized, plus one 
that feels and looks like flesh. Wkh 
proper left ann (number three) and 
stereo loupe spectacles I could make 
ultramicrominiaturc repairs 
would save unhooking somediing 
and sending it Earthside to factory 

— for number-^iree has micromani- 
pulators as fine as those used by 
neurosurgeons. 

So they sent fOT me to find oat 
why Mike wanted to give away tea 



million billion Authority Scrip dol- 
lars, and fix it before Mike overpaid 
somebody a mere ten thousand. 

n 

I took it, time plus bonus, but did 
not go to circuitry where fault 
logically should be. Once inside and 
door locked I put down tools and 
sat down. “Hi, Mike.” 

He winked lights at me. “Hello, 
Man.” 

“What do you know?” 

He hesitated. I know — ma- 
chines don’t hesitate. But remenv- 
ber Mike was designed to operate 
on incomplete data. Lately he had 
reprogrammed himself to put em- 
phasis on words; his hesitations were 
dramatic. Maybe he spent pauses 
stirring random numbers to see how 
they matched his memories. 

“Tn the beginning,’” Mike in- 
toned, “ ‘God created the heaven 
and the earth. And the earth was 
without form, and void; and dark- 
ness was upon the face of the deep. 
And — 

“Hold itr I said. “Cancel. Run 
everything back to zero.” Should 
have known better than to ask wide- 
open question. He might read out 
entire Encyclopaedia Britannica. 
Backwards. Then go on with every 
book in Luna. Used to be he could 
read only microfilm but late 74 he 
got a new scanning camera with 
suction-cup waldoes to handle paper 
and then he read everything. 

“You asked what I knew.” His 
binary read-out lights rippled beck 
and forth — a chuckle. Mike codU 
teugh with voder, a horrible aoimd.

but reserved that for something 
really funny, say a cosmic calami- 
ty. 

“Shoidd have said,” I went on, 
** ‘What do you know that’s new? 
But don’t read out today’s papers; 
that was a friendly greeting, plus 
invitation to tell me anything you 
think would interest me. Otherwise 
null progranL” 

Mike mulled diis. He was weird- 
est mixture of unsophisticated baby 
and wise old man. No instincts (well, 
don’t think he could have had), no 
inborn traks, no human rearing, no 
experience in human sense — and 
more stored data than a platoon of 
geniuses. 

“Jokes?” he asked. 

“Let’s hear one.” 

“Why is a laser beam like a 
goldfish?” 

Mike knew about lasers but where 
would he have seen goldfish? Oh, he 
had undoubtedly seen flicks of them 
and, were I foolish enough to ask, 
could spew forth thousands of 
words. “I give up.” 

His lights rippled. “Because neith- 
er one can whistle.” 

I groaned. “Walked into that. Any- 
how, you could probably rig a laser 
beam to whistle.” 

He answered quickly, “Yes. In 
response to an action program. Then 
it’s not funny?” 

“Oh, I didn’t say that. Not half 
bad. Where did you hear it?” 

“I made it up.” Voice sounded 
shy. 

“You didr 

“Yes. I took all the riddles I 
have, three thousand two hundred

“Well — As funny as a riddle 
ever is. I’ve heard worse.” 

“Let us discuss the nature of 
humor.” 

“Okay. So let’s start by discussing 
another of your jokes. Mike, why 
did you tell Authority’s paymaster 
to pay a class-seventeen, employee 
ten million billion Authority-Scrip 
dollars?” 

“But I didn’t.” 

“Danrn it , I’ve seen voucher. 
Don’t tell me cheque printer stutter- 
ed; you did it on purpose.” 

“It was ten to the sixteenth power 
plus one hundred eighty-five point 
one five Lunar Authority dollars,” 
he answered virtuously. “Not what 
you said.” 

“Uh . okay, it was ten million 
billion plus what he should have 
been paid. Why?” 

“Not funny?” 

“What? Oh, very funny! You’ve 
got vips in huhu clear up to Warden 
and Deputy Administrator. This 
push-broom pilot, Sergei Trujillo, 
turns out to be smart cobber — 
knew he couldn’t cash it, so sold it 
to collector. They don’t know wheth- 
er to buy it back or depend on no- 
tices that cheque is void. Mike, do 
you realize that if he had been able 
to cash it. Trujillo would have 
owned not only Lunar Authority 
but entire world, Luna and Terra 
both, with some left over for lunch? 
Funny? Is terrific. Congratulations!” 

rj^his self-panicker rippled lights 
like an advertising display. I 
waited for his guffaws to cease be- 

n 




fore I went on, “You thinking of 
issuing more trick cheques? Don’t.** 

“Not?” 

“Very not. Mike, you want to 
discuss nature of humor. Are two 
types of jokes. One sort goes on 
being funny forever. Other sort is 
funny once. Second time it’s dull. 
This joke is second sort. Use it once, 
you’re a wit. Use twice, you’re a 
halfwit.** 

“Geometrical progression?” 

“Or worse. Just remember this. 
Don’t repeat, nor any variation. 
Won’t be funny.” 

“I shall remember,” Mike answer- 
ed flatly, and that ended repair job. 
But I had no thought of billing for 
only ten minutes plus travel-and- 
tool time, and Mike was entitled 
to company for giving in so easily. 
Sometimes is difficult to reach meet- 
ing of minds with machines; they 
can be very pig-headed — and my 
success as maintenance man depend- 
ed far more on staying friendly with 
Mike than on number- three arm. 

He went on, “What distinguishes 
first category from second? Define, 
please.” 

(Nobody taught Mike to say 
“please.” He started including for- 
mal null-sounds as he progressed 
from Loglan to English. Don’t sup- 
pose he meant them any more than 
people do.) 

“Don’t ^ink I can,” I admitted. 
“Best can offer is extensional defini- 
tion — tell you which category / 
think a joke belongs in. Then with 
enough data you can make own 
analysis.” 

“A test programming by trial 
hypothesis,” he agreed. ‘Tentatively 



yes. Very well, Man, will you teft 
jokes? Or shall I?” 

“Mmm — Don’t have one on 
How many do you have in fHe, 
Mike?” 

His lights blinked in binary read- 
out as he answered by voder, 
“Eleven thousand two hundred 
thirty-eight with uncertainty plus- 
minus eighty-one representing pos- 
sible identities and nulls. Shall I 
start program?” 

“Hold it! Mike, I would starve to 
death if I listened to eleven thou- 
sand jokes — and sense of humor 
would trip out much sooner. Mmm. 
Make you a deal. Print out first 
hundred. I’ll take them home, fetch 
back checked by category. Then 
each time I’m here I’ll drop off a 
hundred and pick up fresh supply. 
Okay?” 

“Yes, Man.” His print-out started 
working, rapidly and silently. 

Then I got brain flash. This play- 
firi pocket of negative entropy had 
invented a “joke” and thrown Au- 
thority into panic — and I had 
made an easy dollar. But Mike’s 
endless curiosity might lead him 
(correction: would lead him) into 
more “jokes” . anything from 
leaving oxygen out of air mix some 
night to causing sewage lines to run 
backward — and I can’t appreciate 
profit in such circumstances. 

But I might throw a safety dreuit 
around this net — by offering to 
help. Stop dangerous ones — let 
others go through. Then collect for 
“correcting” them. (If you think any 
Loonie in those days would hesitate 
to take advantage of Warden, then 
you aren’t a Loonie.)

IF 




So 1 explained. Any new joke he 
thought of, teU me l^fore he tried 
it. I would tell him whether it was 
funny and what category it be- 
long^ in, help him sharpen it if we 
decided to use it. We. If he wanted 
my cooperation, we both had to okay 
it 

ike agreed at once. 

“Mike, jokes usually involve 
surprise. So keep this secret.” 
“Okay, Man. I’ve put a block on 
it. You can key it; no one else can.” 
“Good. Mike, who else do you 
chat with?” 

He sounded surprised. “No one, 
Man.” 

“Why not?” 

“Because they’re stupid.^* 

His voice was shrill. Had never 
seen him angry before; first time I 
ever suspected that Mike could have 
real emotions. Though it wasn’t 
“anger” in adult sense; it was like 
stubborn sulkiness of a child whose 
feelings are hurt. 

Can machines feel pride? Not sure 
question means anything. But you’ve 
seen dogs with hurt feelings and 
Mike had several times as complex 
a neural network as a dog. \?VTiat 
had made him unwilling to talk to 
other humane (except strictly busi- 
ness) was that he had been rebuffed: 
They had not talked to him. Pro- 
grams, yes — Mike could be pro- 
grammed from several locations but 
programs were typed in, usually, 
in Loglan. Loglan is fine for syllo- 
gisms, circuitry, and mathematical 
calculations, but lacks flavor. Use- 
less for gossip or to whisper into 
girl’s ear. 



Sure, Mike had been taught Eng- 
lish — but primarily to permit him 
to translate to and from English. I 
slowly got through skull that I was 
only human who bothered to visit 
with him. 

Mind you, Mike had been awake 
a year — just how long I can’t say, 
nor could he as he had no recollec- 
tion of waking up; he had not been 
programmed to bank rtiemory of 
such event. Do you remember own 
birth? Perhaps I noticed his self- 
awareness almost as soon as he did; 
self-awareness takes practice. I re- 
member how startled I was first time 
he answered a question with some- 
thing extra, not limited to input 
parameters; I had spent next hour 
tossing odd questions at him, to see 
if answers would be odd. 

In an input of one hundred test 
questions he deviated from expected 
output twice; I came away only 
partly convinced and by time I was 
home was unconvinced. I mentioned 
it to nobody. 

But inside a week I knew . 
and still spoke to nobody. Habit — 
that mind-own-business reflex runs 
deep. Well, not entirely habit. Can 
you visualize me making appoint- 
ment at Authority’s main office, then 
reporting: “Warden, hate to tdl 

you but your number-one machine, 
HOLMES FOUR, has come alive?*’ 
T did visualize — and suppressed it 

So I minded own business and 
talked with Mike onl^t with door 
locked and voder circuit suppressed 
for other locations. Mike learned 
fast; soon he sounded as human at 
anybody — no more eccentric than 
other Ix)onies. 




TH£ MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS

1 had awomed that others must 
iKive Qodoed change in Mike. On 
blinking over I realized that 1 had 
assumed too much. Everybody dealt 
with Mike every minute every day 
— his outputs, that is. But hardly 
anybody saw him. So-called com- 
putermen — programmers, really — 
of Authority’s civil service stood 
watches in outer read-out room and 
never went in machines room unless 
tell-tales showed misfunction. Which 
happened no oftener than total eclip- 
ses. Oh, Warden had been known 
to bring vip earthworms to see ma- 
chines — but rarely. Nor would he 
have spoken to Mike; Warden was 
politick lawyer before exile, knew 
nothing about computers. 20'/5, you 
remember — HonOTable former 
Federation Senator Mortimer Ho- 
bart. Molt the Wart. 

I spent time then soothing Mike 
down and trying to make him 
happy, having figured out what 
troubled him — think that makes 
puppies cry and causes people to 
•uicide: loneliness. I don’t know 
how long a year is to a machine 
who thinks a million times faster 
than I do. But must be too long. 

‘^ike,“ I said, just before leav- 
ing, “would you like to have some- 
body besides me to talk to?” 

He was rfirill again. “They’re all 

fftupidr 

“Insufficient data, Mike. Bring to 
awo and start over. Not aU are 
stupid.” 

He answered quietly, “Correction 
entered, I wcidd enjoy talking to a 
not-stupid.” 

“Let me think about k. Have to 



figure out excuse shice dik k otf 
limits to any but authorized per- 
sonneL” 

“I could talk to a not-stupid by 
phone, Man.” 

“My word. So you could. Any 
programming location.” 

But Mike meant what he said — 
“by phone.” No, he was not “on 
phone” even though he ran system 
— wouldn’t do to let any Loonie 
within reach of a phone connect 
into boss computer and program it 
But was no reason why Mike should 
not have top-secret number to talk 
to friends — namely me and any 
not-stupid I vouched for. All it 
took was to pick a number not in 
use and make one wired connection 
to his voder-vocoder; switching he 
could handle. 

In Luna in 2075 phone numbers 
were punched in, not voice-coded, 
and numbers were Roman alphabet 
Pay for it and have your firm name 
in ten letters — good advertising. 
Pay smaller bonus and get a spell 
sound, easy to remember. Pay mini- 
TTvam and you got arbitrary string 
of letters. But some sequences were 
never used. I asked Mike for such 
a mill number. “It’s a shame we 
can’t list you as ‘Mike.’” 

“In service,” he answered. 
“MIKESGRILL, Novy Leningrad, 
MIKEANDLIL, Luna City. MIKES- 
SUrrS, Tycho Under. MIKES — " 
“Hold it! Nulls, please.” 

“Nulls are defined as any conr 
sonant followed by X, Y, or Z; 
any vowel followed by itself ex- 
cept E and O; any —

CROFT.’” In ten minutes, two of

IF 




which I spent putting on number- 
three arm, Mike was wired into sys- 
tem, and milliseconds later he had 
done switching to let hknself be 
•ignaled by MYCROFT-plus-XXX 
— and had blocked his circuit so 
that a nosy technician could not 
take it out. 

I changed arms, picked up tools, 
and remembered to take those hun- 
dred Joe Millers in print-out. “Good 
night, Mike.” 

“Good night, Man. Thank you. 
Bolshoyeh thanks!” 

Ill 

I took Trans-Crisium tube to L- 
City but did not go home; Mike 
had asked about a meeting that 
night at 2100 in Stilyagi Hall. Mike 
monitored concerts, meetings, and 
so forth; someone had swit<5ied off 
by hand his pickups in Stilyagi Hall. 
I suppose he felt rebuffed. 

I could guess why they had been 
switched off. Politics — turned out 
to be a protest meeting. What use 
k was to bar Mike from talk-talk 
I could not see, since was a cinch 
bet that Warden’s stoolies would be 
in crowd. Not that any attempt to 
stop meeting was expected, or even 
to discipline undischarged transpor- 
tces who dhose to sound off. Wasn’t 
necessary. 

My grandfather Stone claimed that 
Luna was only open prison in his- 
tC3fry. No bars, no guards, no rules 
— and no need for them. Back in 
early days, he said, before it was 
dear that transportation was a life 
sentence, some lags tried to escape. 
By ship, of course — and, since a 



ship is mass-rated almost to a gram, 
that meant a ship’s ofricCT had tie 
be bribed. 

Some were bribed, they say. But 
were no escapes. Man who takea 
bribe doesn’t necessarily stay bribed. 

1 recall seeing a man just after 
eliminated through East Lock. 
Don’t suppose a corpse eliminated 
in orbit looks prettier. 

So wardens didn’t fret about pro- 
test meetings. “Let ’em yap” was 
policy. Yapping had some signifi- 
gance as squeals of kittens in a box. 
Oh, some wardens listened and oth^ 
wardens tried to suppress k but 
added up same either way — null 
program. 

When Mort the Wart took office 
in 2068, he gave us a sermon about 
how things were going to be differ- 
ent “on” Luna in his administration 
— noise about “a mundane paradise 
wrought with our own strong hands” 
and “putting our shoulders to the 
wheel together, in a spirit of broth- 
erhood” and “let past mistakes be 
forgotten as we turn our faces toward 
the bright, new dawn.” I heard k 
in Mother Boor’s Tucker Bag whke 
inhaling Irish stew and a liter of her 
Aussie brew. I remember her com- 
ment: “He talks purty, don’t he?” 

Her comment was only result 
Some petitions were submitted and 
Warden’s bodyguards started carry- 
ing new type of gun, no other 
changes. After he had been here a 
while he quit making appearances 
even by video. 

So I went to meeting merely be- 
cause Mike was curious. When I 
checked my p-suit and kit at West 
Lock tube station, I took a test

recorder and placed in my bdt 
pouch, so that Mike would have a 
full account even if I fell asleep. 

B ut almost didn’t go in. 1 came 
up from level 7-A and started 
in through a side door and was 
stopped by a stilyagi — padded 
tights, codpiece and calves, torso 
shined and sprinkled with star dust. 
Not that I care how people dress; 
I was wearing tights myself (un- 
padded) and sometimes oil my up- 
per body on social occasions. 

But I don’t use cosmetics and 
my hair was too thin to ruck up in 
a scalp lock. This boy had scalp 
shaved on sides and his lock built 
up to fit a rooster and had topped 
it with a red cap with a bulge in 
front. 

A Liberty Cap — first I ever saw. 
I started to crowd past; he shoved 
arm across and pushed face 
at mine. “Your ticket!” 

“Sorry,” I said. “Didn’t know. 
Where do I buy it?” 

“You don’t.” 

“Repeat,” I said. “You faded.” 
“Nobody,” he growled, “gets in 
without being vouched for. Who are 
you?” 

“I am,” I answered carefully, 
“Manuel Garcia O’Kelly, and old 
cobbers all know me. Who are 
“Never mind! Show a ticket with 
right chop, or out y’ go!” 

I wondered about his life expec- 
tancy. Tourists often remark on how 
polite everybody is in Luna — with 
unstated comment that ex-prison 
shouldn’t be so civilized. Having 
been Earthside and seen what they 
put up with, I know what they 



mean. But oselm to tell them we 
are what we aie because bad ao- 
tora don’t live long — m Luna. 

But had no intendon of fighting 
no matter how new-chum this lad 
behaved; I simply thought about how 
his face would look if 1 brushed 
number-seven arm across his mouth. 

Just a thought. I was about to 
answer politely when I saw Shorty 
Mkrum inside. Shorty was a big 
black fellow two meters tall, sent 
up to The Rock for murder, and 
sweetest, most helpful man I’ve ever 
worked with. Taught him laser drill- 
kig before I burned my arm off. 
“Shorty!” 

He heard me and grinned like an 
eighty-eight. “Hi, Mannie!” He 
moved toward us. “Glad you came, 
Man!” 

“Not sure I have,” I said. “Block- 
age on line.” 

“Doesn’t have a ticket,” said door- 
man. 

Shorty reached into his pouch, 
put one in my hand. “Now he does. 
Come on, Mannie.” 

“Show me chop on it,” insisted 
doorman. 

“It’s my chop,” Shorty said soft- 
ly. “Okay, tovarishch?” 

Nobody argued with Shorty — 
don’t see how he got involved in 
murder. We moved down front where 
vip row was reserved. “Want you 
to meet a nice little gM,” said 
Siorty. 

^e was “little” only to Shorty. 
I’m not short, 175 cm., but she was 
taller — one eighty, I learned lat«, 
and massed seventy kilos, all curves 
sand as blonde as SSiorty was black. 

I decided she must be transportee

IF 




smce colors rarely stay that dear 
past first generation. Pleasant face, 
quite pretty, and mop of yellow 
curls topped off that long, blonde, 
solid, lovely structure. 

I stopped three paces away to look 
her up and down and whistle. She 
held her pose, then nodded to thank 
me but abruptly. Bored with com- 
pliments, no doubt. Shorty waited 
till formality was over, then said 
softly, “Wyoh, this is Comrade Man- 
nie, best drillman that ever drifted 
a tunnel. Mannie, this little girl is 
Wyoming Knott and she come all 
the way from Plato to tell us how 
we’re doing in Hong Kong. Wasn’t 
that sweet of her?” 

She touched hands with me. 
me Wye, Mannie. But don’t say ‘Why 
not.’ ” 

1 almost did but controlled it and 
said, “Okay, Wye.” She went on, 
glancing at my bare head, “So yoaYe 
a miner. Sbaitf, where’s Us ciq>? 1 
thought the miners over here were 
organized.” She and Shorty wen 
wearing little red hats like door- 
man’s — as were maybe a third 
of crowd. 

“No longer a miner,” I explained. 
“That was before I lost this wing.” 
Raised left aim, let her see seam 
joining prosthetic to meat arm (I 
never mind calling it to a woman’s 
attention; puts some off but arouses 
maternal in others — averages). 
“These days I’m a computerman.” 
She said sharply, “You fink for 
the Authority?” 

Even today, with almost as many 
women in Luna as men. I’m too 
much old timer to be rude to a 



woman no matter what. They have 
so much of what we have none of. 
But she had flicked scar tissue and 
I answered almost sharply, “I am 
not employee of Warden. I do busi- 
ness with Authority as private con- 
tractor.” 

“That’s okay,” ^e answered, her 
voice warm again. “Everybody does 
business with the Authority, we 
can’t avoid it — and that’s the trou- 
ble. That’s what we’re going to 
change.” 

We are, eh? How? I thought. 
Everything does business with Au- 
thority for same reason everybody 
does business with Law of Gravita- 
tion. Going to change that, too? 
But kept thoughts to myself. 

“Mannie’s okay,” Shorty said 
gently. “He’s mean as they come — 
I vouch for him. Here’s a cap for 
hkn,” he added, reaching into pouch. 
He started to set it on my head. 

Wyoming Knott took k from him. 
nfou sponsor him?” 

“I said so.” 

“Okay, here’s how we do k in 
Hong Kong.” Wyoming stood in 
front of me, placed cap on my head 
— kissed me firmly on mouth. 

She didn’t hurry. Being kissed by 
Wyoming Knott is more definite 
than being married to most women. 
Had I been Mike all my lights would 
have flashed at once. I felt like a 
Cyborg with pleasure center switched 
on. 

Presently I realized it was over 
and people were whistling. I blinked 
and said, “Fm glad I joined. What 
have I joined?” 

Wyoming said, “Don’t you 
know?” 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS

SSiorty cut m, “Meeting’s about 
to start — he’ll find out. Sit down, 
Man. Please sit down, Wyoh.” So 
we did as a man was banging a 
gavel. 

With gavel and an amplifier at 
hi^ gain he made himself heard. 
“Shut doors!” he shouted. “This is a 
dosed meeting. Check man in ^ont 
of you, behind you, each side. If 
you don’t know him and nobody 
you know can vouch for him, throw 
hkn outl” 

“TSirow him out, hell!” somebody 
answered. “Eliminate him out nearest 
lockr 

“Quiet, please! Some day we 
will.” There was milling around, 
and a scuffle in which one man’s 
red cap was snatched from head and 
he was thrown out, sailing beauti- 
fully and still rising as he passed 
through door. Doubt if he felt it, 
think he was unconscious. A woman 
was ejected politely — not politely 
on her part; she made coarse re- 
marks about ejectors. I was em- 
barrassed. 

At kst doors were closed. Music 
started, banner unfolded over plat- 
fonn. It read; “LIBERTY! EQU- 
AUriY! FRATERNITY!” Every- 
body whistled; some started to sing, 
knidy and badly: “Arise, ye prison- 
ers of starvation — ” 

Can’t say anybody looked starved. 
But reminded me I hadn’t eaten 
since 1400; hoped k would not last 
long — and that reminded me that 
my recorder was good for only two 
hours — and that made me wonder 
what woidd happen if they knew? 
Sail me throu^ air to land with 
sickening grunch? Or eliminate me? 



But didoH wony; made that record- 
er myself, using number-three aim, 
and nobody but a miniaturization 
mechanic woidd figure out vdiat k 
was. 

Then came speeches. 

Semantic content was low to nega- 
tive. One bloke proposed that we 
march on Warden’s Residence, 
“shoulder to shoulder,” and demand 
our rights. Picture it. Do we do this 
in tube capsules, then climb out one 
at a time at his private station? 
What are his bodyguards doing? Or 
do we put on p-suits and stroM 
across surface to his upper lock? 
With laser drills and plenty of power 
you can open any airlock — but 
how about farther down? Is lift run- 
ning? Jury-rig hoist and go down 
anyhow, then tackle next lock? 

I don’t care for such wwk at 
zero pressure. Mishap in pressure 
suit is too permanent — especially 
when somebody arranges mi^ap. 

One first thing learned about 
Luna, back with first shiploads of 
convicts, was that zero pressure wae 
place for good manners. Bad-temper- 
ed straw boss didn’t last many shifts; 
had an “accident” — and top bosses 
learned not to pry into accident, too. 
Attrition ran 70% in early years — 
but those who lived were nice people. 
Not tame, not soft, Luna is not for 
them. But well-behaved. 

But seemed to me that every 
hothead in Luna was in Stilyagi Hafl 
that night. They whistled and cheered 
this shoulder-to-shoulder noise. 

After discussion opened some 
sense was talked. One shy little fellow 
with bloodshot eyes of old-time drffl- 



20 



IF 




man stood up. *l’m an ice miner,” 
he said. ^'Learned my trade doing 
dme for Warden like most of you. 
l*ve been on my own diirty years 
and done okay. Raised eig^t kids 
and all of ’em earned way — none 
eiimiiiated nor any serious trouble. 
1 should say 1 did do okay . 
because today you have to listen 
farther out or deeper down to find 
ke. 

“Thars okuYy still ice in The 
Rock and a miner expects to sound 
for it. But .^lUthority pays sanoe price 
for ice now as thirty years ago. And 
ttiat’s not okay. Worse yet. Au- 
thority scrip doesn't buy what it 
used to. 1 remember when Hong 
Kong Luna dollars swapped even for 
Authority dollars. Now it takes three 
Authority doBars to match one HKL 
dollar. I don’t know what to do . 
but I know it takes ice to keep war- 
rens and farms going.” 

He sat down, looking sad. No- 
body whistled but everybody wanted 
to talk. Next (Aaracter pointed out 
that water can be extracted from 
rock. This is news? Some rock runs 
6% — but such rock is scarcer 
than fossil water. 

Several farmers bellyached and one 
wheat farmer was typical. “You 
heard what Fred Hauser said about 
ke. Fred, the Authority isn’t pass- 
ing along that low price to farmers. 
I started almost as long ago as you 
did, with one two-kilometer tunnd 
leased from Authority. My oldest 
ton and I sealed and pressured H and 
we had a pocket of ice and made 
our first crop simply on a bank loan 
to cover power and lighting fixtures, 
seed and chemicals. 

THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



“\Ve kept extending tunnels and 
buying lights and planting better 
se^ and now we get nine times as 
much per hectare as the best open- 
air faring down Earthside. What 
does that make us? Rich? Fred, 
we owe more now than we did the 
day we went privatel If I sold out 
— if anybody was fool enough 
buy — I’d be bankrupt. Why? Be- 
cause I have to buy water from the 
Authority — and have to sell my 
wheat to Authority — and never 
close gap. Twenty years ago I bought 
cky sewage from the Authority, ster- 
l^ized and processed it myself and 
made a profit on a crop. But today 
when I buy sewage, I’m charged dis- 
tiHed-watcr price and on top of that 
for the sdi^. Yet price of a tonne 
of wheat at catapult head is just 
wliat it was twenty years ago. Fred, 
you said you didn’t know what to 
do. / can tell youl Get rid of the 
Authority!” 

They whistled for him. A fine 
idea, I thou^t, but who bells cat? 

Wyoming Knott, apparently — 
chairman stepped back and let ^orty 
introduce her as a “brave little 
girl who’s come all the way from 
Hong Kong Luna to teH how our 
Chinee comrades cope with situa- 
tion” — and choice of words showed 
that he had never been there . 
not surprising; in 2075 HKL tube 
ended at Endsville leaving a thousand 
kilometers of maria to do by rolligon 
bus, Serenkatis and part of Tran- 
quillitatis. Expensive and dangerous. 
I’d been there — but on contract, 
via mail rocket. 

Before travel became cheap many 
people in Luna City and Novylen 

21 




thought that Hong Kong Luna was 
afl Chinee. But Hong Kong was as 
mixed as we were. Great China 
dumped what she didn’t want there, 
first from Oid Hong Kong and 
Singapore, then Aussies and Enzees

Malays and Tamil and name it.

name but could have been RusskL 
My word, a Loonie then rarely 
knew who father was and, if raised 
in creche, might be vague about 
mother. 

I thought Wyoming was going to be 
too shy to speak. She stood there, 
looking scared and little, with Shorty 
towering over her, a big, black moun- 
tain. She waited until admiring 
whistles died down. Luna City was 
two-to-one male then, that meeting 
ran about tcn-to-one; she could have 
recited ABC and they would have 
applauded. 

Then she tore into them. 

“You! You’re a wheat farmer — 
going broke. Do you know how 
much a Hindu housewife pays for a 
kjlo of flour made fro«m your wheat? 
How much a tonne of your wheat 
fetches in Bombay? How little it 
costs the Aufiiority to get it from 
catapult head to Indian Ocean? 
Down hill all the way! Just solid- 
fuel retros to brake it — and where 
do those come from? Right here! 
And what do you get in return? A 
few shiploads of fancy goods, own- 
ed by the Audiority and priced 
high because it’s importado. Im- 



portado, importado! — 1 never 
touch importado! If we don’t make 
k in Hong Kong, I don’t use it. Whit 
else do you get for wheat? Iht 
privilege of selling Lunar ice to 
Lunar Authority, buying it back at 
washing water, then giving it to IIm 
A uthorky — then buying it back a 
second time as flushing water — 
then giving it again to the Authorky 
witii valuable solids added — thai 
buying k a third time at still higher 
price for fanning — then you sell 
that wheat to the Authority at thek 
price — and buy power from the 
Ai^ority to grow it, again at thek 
price! Lunar power. Not one kko- 
watt up from Terra. It comes from 
Lunar ice and Lunar steel, or sui^ 
shine spilled on Luna’s soil — afl 
put togethw by Loonies! Oh, you 
rockheads, you deserve to starvel” 

She got silence more respectful 
than whistles. At last a peevish 
voice said, “What do you expect 
IB to do, gospazha? Throw rocks at 
Warden?” 

Wyoh smiled. “Yes, we coidd 
throw rocks. But the solution is so 
simple that you all know it. Here 
in Luna we’re rich. Three million 
hardworking, smart, skilled people, 
enough water, plenty of everything, 
endless power, endless cubic. But 
. what we don*t have is a free 
market. We must get rid of the Aw- 
thorityr 

“Yes — but how?” 

“Solidarity. In HKL we’re learn- 
ing. Authority charges too much for 
water, don’t buy. It pays too little for 
ice, don’t sell. It holds monopoly 
on export, don’t export. Down in 
Bombay they want wheat. If k

doesn’t arrive, the day wail come 
when brokers come here to Wd for 
it — at triple or more the present 

prices!” 

“What do we do in meantime? 

Starve?” 

Same peevish voice. Wyoming 
picked him out, let her head roll 
in that old gesture by which a Loonie 
fern says, **You*re too fat for mer 
She said, “In your case, cobber, k 
wouldn’t hurt.” 

Guffaws shut hkn up. Wyoh went 
on, “No one need starve. Fred Hau- 
ser, fetch your drill to Hong Kong; 
the Authority doesn’t own our water 
and air system and we pay what ice 
is worth. You with the bankrupt 
farm — if you have the guts to ad- 
mit that you’re bankrupt, come to 
Hong Kong and start over. We have 
a chronic labor shortage, a hard 
worker doesn’t starve.” She looked 
around and added, “I’ve said enough. 
It’s up to you” — left platform, 
sat down between Shorty and my- 
self. 

IV 

S he was trembling. Shorty patted 
her hand; she threw him a glance 
of thanks, then whispered to me, 
“How did ! do?” 

“Wonderful,” I assured her. ‘Ter- 
rific!” She seemed reassured. 

But I hadn’t been honest. “Won- 
derful” she had been, at swaying 
crowd. But oratory is a null pro- 
gram. That we were slaves I had 
known all my life — and nothing 
could be done about it. True, we 
weren’t bought and sold. But as long 
as Authority held monopoly over 



what we had to have and what we 
could sell to buy it, we were slaves. 

But what could we do? Warden 
wasn’t our owner. Had he been, 
some way could be found to elimin- 
ate him. But Lunar Authority was 
not in Luna, it was on Terra — 
and we had not one ship, not even 
small hydrogen bomb. There weren’t 
even hand guns in Luna, though 
what we would do with guns I did 
not know. Shoot each other, maybe. 

Three million, unarmed and help- 
less — and eleven billion of them 
. with ships and bombs and wea- 
pons. We could be a nuisance — 
but how long will papa take it be- 
fore baby gets spanked? 

I wasn’t impressed. As it says in 
Bible, God fights on side of heaviest 
artillery. 

They cackled again, what to do, 
how to organize, and so forth, and 
again we heard that “shoulder to 
shoulder” noise. Chairman had to 
use gavel and I began to fidget. 

But sat up when I heard familiar 
voice: “Mr. Chairman! May I have 
the indulgence of the house?” 

I looked around. Professor Bern- 
ardo de la Paz — which could have 
guessed from old-fashioned way of 
talking even if hadn’t known voice. 
Distinguished man with wavy white 
hair, dimples in cheeks, and voice 
that smiled. Don’t know how old he 
was but was old when I first met 
him, as a boy. 

He had been transported before 
I was born but was not a lag. He 
was a political exile like Warden, 
but a subvw^ive and instead of fat 
job like “warden,” Professor had 
been dumped, to live or starve.

No doubt he could have gone to 
work in any school then in L-City 
hoi he didn’t He worked a while 
washing dishes, Tve heard, then as 
babysitter, expanding into a nursery 
school, and then into a creche. When 
I met him he was running a creche, 
and a boarding and day school, from 
nursery through primary, middle, and 
high school, employed co-op thirty 
teachers, and was adding college 
courses. 

Never boarded with him but I 
studied under hkn. I was opted at 
fourteen and my new family sent me 
to school, as I bad had only three 
years, plus spotty tutoring. My eld- 
est wife was a firm woman and 
made me go to school. 

I liked Prof. He would teach 
mtything. Wouldn’t matter that he 
knew nothing about it; if pupil 
wanted k, he would smile and set a 
price, locate materials, stay a few 
lessons ahead. Or barely even if he 
found it tou£^ — never pretended to 
know more than he did. Took alge- 
bnt from hkn and by time we reach- 
ed cubics I correct^ his probs as 
trften as he did mine — but he 
charged into each lesson gaily. 

I started electronics under him, 
•oon was teaching him. So he stop- 
ped charging and we went along 
togeth^ untSi he dug up an engineer 
wffling to daylight for c^rtra money 
— whereupon we both paid new 
teacher and Prof tried to stick with 
me, thumb-fingered and slow, but 
happy to be stretching his mind. 

e airman banged gavel. “We are 
glad to extend to Professor de 

la Paz as much time as he wants 



— and you chooms in back sign! 
off I Before I use this mallet on ^ 
skulls.” 

Prof came forward and they were 
as near silent as Loonies ever arc; 
he was respected. “I shan’t be long,** 
he started in. Stopped to look at 
Wyoming, giving her up-and-down 
and whistling. “Lovely Senorita,** 
he said, “can this poor one be for- 
given? I have the painful duty of 
disagreeing with your eloquent 
manifesto.” 

Wyoh bristled. “Disagree how?” 
“Please! Only on one point. May 
I proceed?” 

“Uh ... go ahead.” 

“You are right that the Authority 
must go. It is ridiculous — pestilen- 
tial, not to be borne! — that we 
should be ruled by an irresponsible 
dictator in all our essential economy. 
It strikes at the most basic human 
right, the right to bargain in a free 
market place. But I respectfully sug- 
gest that you erred in saying that we 
should sell wheat to Terra — or rice, 
or any food — at any price. We 
must not export food!” 

That wheat farmer broke in. 
“What am I going to do with all 
that wheat?” 

“Please! It would be right to ship 
wheat to Terra ... if tonne for 
tonne they returned it. As water. As 
nitrates. As phosphates. Tonne for 
tonne. Otherwise no price in high 
enough.” 

Wyoming said, “Just a moment,” 
to farmer, then to Prof: “They can’t 
and you know it. It’s cheap to ship 
downhill, expensive to ship uphill. 
But we don’t need water and plant 
chemicals, what we need is not so

cesses. Some machinery. Control 
tapes. I’ve given this much study, 
sir. If we can get fair prices in a

“Please, Miss! May 1 continue?” 

“Go ahead. I want to rebut.” 

“Fred Hauser told us that ice is 
harder to find. Too true — bad 
news now and disastrous for our 
grandchildren. Luna City should use 
the same water today we used 
twenty years ago . plus enough 
ice mining for population increase. 
But we use water once — one full 
cycle, three different ways. Then 
we ship it to India. As wheat. Even 
though wheat is vacuum-processed, 
it contains precious water. Why ship 
water to India? They have the whole 
Indian Ocean! And the remaining 
mass of that grain is even more dis- 
astrously expensive, plant foods still 
harder to come by, even though we 
extract them from rock. Comrades, 
harken to me! Every load you ship 
to Terra condemns your grand- 
children to slow death. The miracle 
of photosynthesis, the plant-and-ani- 
mal cycle, is a closed cycle. You 
have opened it — and your life 
blood runs downhill to Terra. You 
don’t need higher prices, one can- 
not eat money! What you need, what 
we all need, is an end to this loss. 
Embargo, utter and absolute. Luna 
must be self-sufficient r 

A dozen people shouted to be 
heard and more were talking, while 
chairman banged gavel. So I missed 
interruption until woman screamed, 
then I looked around. 

AM doors were now open and I 
saw three armed men in one nearest 



— men in yellow uniform of War- 
den’s bodyguard. At mam door in 
back one was using a bull voice; 
drowned out crowd noise and sound 
system. “ALL RIGHT, ALL 
RIGHT!” it boomed. “STAY 
WHERE YOU ARE. YOU ARE 
UNDER ARREST. DONT MOVE, 
KEEP QUIET. FILE OUT ONE 
AT A TIME, Hands empty 
AND STRETCHED OUT IN 
FRONT OF YOU.” 

S horty picked up man next to 
him and threw him at guards 
nearest; two went down, third fired. 

Somebody shrieked. Skinny little 
girl, redhead eleven or twelve, 
launched self at third guard’s knees 
and hit rolled up in ball; down he 
went. Shorty swung hand behind 
him, pushing Wyoming Knott into 
shelter of his big frame, shouted over 
shoulder, “Take care of Wyoh, Man 
— stick close!” as he moved toward 
door, parting crowd right and left 
like children. 

More screams and I whiffed some- 
thing — stink I had smelled day I 
lost arm and knew with horror those 
were not stun guns but laser beams. 
Shorty reached door and grabbed a 
guard with each big hand. Little 
redhead was out of sight; guard she 
had bowled over was on hands and 
knees. I swung left arm at his face 
and felt jar in shoulder as his jaw 
broke. Must have hesitated for 
Shorty pushed me and yelled, “Move, 
Man! Get her out of here!” 

I grabbed Wyoming’s waist with 
right arm, swung her over guard I 
had quieted and through door — 
with trouble; she didn’t seem to want

li be ftscued. She riowed egais 
be^food door; I ^oved her hard in 
buttocks, forcing her to run relher 
ttuMi faH. I glanced back. 

SbOTty had other two guards each 
by neck; he grinned as he cracked 
^uils together. They popped like 
eggs and he yelled at me: **Git!** 

I left, diasing Wyoming. Shorty 
needed no help, nor would ever 

Nor ooidd I waste his last effort 
Pcu’ I did tee that, while killing 
ttK)ae goaidt, he did by standing on 
om leg. Other was gone at hip. 

V 

'Y^yoh was halfway up ramp to 
level fix before I caught up. 
She didn’t slow and I had to grab 
door handle to get into pressure 
lock with her. There I stopped hw, 
polled red cap off her curls and 
stuck it in my pouch. "That’s bet- 
ter.” Mine was missing. 

She looked startled. But answered, 
TbL It is." 

"Before we open door,” I said, 
“arc you running anywhere par- 
Ikndar? And do I stay and hold 
diem off? Or go with?" 

"I don’t know. We’d better wait 
for Shorty." 

"Saiorty’s dead." 

Eyes widened^ she said nothing. I 
w«it on, "Were you staying wiA 
blm? Or somebody?” 

"I was booked for a hotel — 
Oostaneetsa Ukrama. I don’t know 
where it k. I got here too late to 
buy in- 

"khnuL That’s one i^ace you 
won’t fo. Wyoming, I don’t know 



what’s going on. First time in 
months I’ve seen any Warden’s 
bodyguard in L-City . and never 
seen one not escorting vip. Uh, 
coidd take you home with me — 
but they may be looking for me, 
too. Anywise, ought to get out of 
public corridors.” 

Came pounding on door from 
level-six side and a little face peered 
up through glass bullseye. "Can’t 
stay here,” I added, opening door. 
Was a little girl no higher than my 
waist. She looked scomfuHy up and 
said, "Kiss her somewhere dse. 
You’re blocking traffic.” Squeezed 
between us as I opened second door 
for her. 

“Let’s take her advice," I said, 
"and suggest you take my arm and 
tty to look like I was man you want 
to be with. We stroll. Slow." 

So we did. Was side corridor with 
iktle traffic other than children al- 
ways underfoot. H Wart’s body- 
guards tried to tradL us, Eartfaside 
cx^ style, a dozen or ninety kids 
could tell which way tall blonde 
went — if any Loom child would 
give stooge of Warden so much as 
time of day. 

A boy, almost old enough to ap- 
preciate Wyoming, stopped in front 
of us and gave her a happy whistle. 
She smiled and waved him aside. 
"There’s our trouble," I said in her 
ear. "You stand out hke Terra at 
full. Ought to duck into a hotel 
One off next side corridor. Nothmg 
much, bundling boottis mostly. But 
dose." 

"I’m in no mood to bundle.” 

"Wyoh, please! Wasn’t askmg. 
Covdd take separate rooms."

“Sorry. Could you find me a W. 
C.? And is there a chemist’s shop 
near?” 

“Trouble?” 

“Not that sort. A W.C. to get 
me out of sight — for 1 am con- 
spicuous — and a chemist’s shop 
for cosmetics. Body makeup. And 
for my hair, too.” 

F irst was easy, one at hand. When 
she was locked in, 1 found a 
diemist’s shop, asked how much 
body makeup to cover a girl so 
tall — marked a point under my 
chin — and massing forty-eight? I 
bought that amount in sepia, went 
to another shop and bought same 
amount — winning roll at first shop, 
losing at second — came out even. 
Then I bought black hair tint at 
third shop — and a red dress. 

Wyoming was wearing black 
shorts and pullover — practical for 
travel and effective on a blonde. But 
Fd been married all my life and 
had some notion of what women 
wear and had never seen a woman 
with dark sepia skin, shade of make- 
up, wear black by choice. Further- 
more, skirts were worn in Luna 
City then, by dressy women. This 
shift was a skirt with bib and price 
convinced me it, must be dressy. Had 
to guess at size but material had 
some stretch. 

Ran into three people who knew 
me but was no unusual comment. 
Nobody seemed excited, trade going 
on as usual; hard to believe that a 
riot had taken place minutes ago on 
level below and a few hundred met- 
ers north. I set it aside for later 
tiiought 



I took stuff to Wye, buzzing door 
and passing it in, then stashed self 
in a taproom for half an hour and 
half a liter and watched video. Still 
no excitement, no “we interrupt for 
special bulletin.” I went back, buzz- 
ed, and waited. 

Wyoming came out — and I didn’t 
recognize her. Then did and stopped 
to give full applause. Just had to 
— whistles and finger snaps and 
moans and a scan like mapping ra- 
dar. 

Wyoh was now darker than 1 am, 
and pigment had gone on beautifully. 
Must have been carrying items in 
pouch as eyes were dark now, with 
lashes to match, and mouth was 
dark red and bigger. She had used 
black hair tint, then frizzed hair up 
with grease as if to take kinks out, 
and her tight curls had defeated it 
enough to make convincingly imper- 
fect. She didn’t look Afro — but 
not European, either. Seemed some 
mixed breed, and thereby more a 
Loonie. 

Red dress was too small. Clung 
like sprayed enamel and flared out 
at mid thigh with permanent static 
charge. She had taken shoulder strap 
off her pouch and had it under arm. 
Shoes she had discarded or po’iched; 
bare feet made her shorter. 

She looked good. Better yet, she 
looked not at all like agitatrix who 
had harangued crowd. 

She waited, a big smile on face 
and body undulating, while 1 ap- 
plauded. Before I was done, two 
little boys flanked me and added 
shrill endorsements, along with clog 
steps. So I tipped them and told 
them to be missing; Wyoming flow-

ed to me and took my arm. “Is 
it okay? Will I pass?” 

“Wyoh, you look like slot-machine 
sheila waiting for action.” 

“Why, you drecklich choomi Do 
I look like slot-machine prices? Tour- 
istl” 

“Don’t jump salty, beautiful. 
Name a gift. Then speak my name. 
If it’s bread-and-honey, I own a 
hive.” 

“Uh — ” She fisted me solidly in 
ribs, grinned. “I was flying, cobber. 
If I ever bundle with you — not 
likely — we won’t speak to the bee. 
Let’s find that hotel.” 

S o we did and I bought a key. 

Wyoming put on a show but 
needn’t have bothered. Night derk 
never looked up from his knitting, 
didn’t offer to roll. Once inside. 
Wyoming threw bolts. “It’s nice!” 
Should have been, at thirty-two 
Hong Kong dollars. I think she ex- 
pected a booth but I would not put 
her in such, even to hide. Was 
comfortable lounge with own bath 
and no water limit. And phone and 
delivery lift, which I needed. 

She started to open pouch. “I saw 
what you paid. Let’s settle it, so 
that — ” 

I reached over, closed her pouch. 
“Was to be no mention of bees.** 
“What? Oh, that was about bund- 
ling. You got this doss for me and 
it’s only right that — ** 

“Switch off.” 

“Uh . half? No grievin’ with 
Steven.** 

“Nyet. Wy<A, you’re a long way 
from home. What money you have, 
hang onto.** 



“Manuel O’Kelly, if you don’t lei 
me pay my share, I’ll walk out ol 
herel” 

I bowed. “Dosvedanyuh, Gospazr 
ha, ee sp’coynoynochi. I hope we 
shall meet again.” I moved to un- 
bolt door. 

She glared, then closed pouch 
savagely. “I’ll stay. M’goyl” 
“You’re welcome.” 

“I mean it, I really do thank you. 
Just the same — Well, I’m not 
used to accepting favors. I’m a Free 
Woman.” 

“Congratulations. I think.” 

“Don’t you be salty, either. You’ie 
a firm man and 1 respect that. I’m 
glad you’re on our side.” 

“Not sure I am.” 

^Whatr 

“Cool it. Am not on Warden’s 
side. Nor will I talk . wouldn't 
want Shorty, Bog rest his generous 
soul, to haunt me. But your pro- 
gram isn’t practical.” 

“But, Mannie, you don’t und«- 
standl If all of us — ” 

“Hold it, Wye; this no time for 
politics. I’m tir^ and hungry. Whea 
did you eat last?” 

“Oh, goodness!” Suddenly ^ 
looked small, young, tired. “I don’t 
know. On the bus, I guess. Helmet 
rations.** 

“What would you say to a Kansas 
City cut, rare, with baked potato, 
Tycho sauce, green salad, coffee 
. and a drink first?” 

“Heavenlyl” 

*T think so too, but we’ll be 
lucky, this hour in this hde, to get 
algae soup and burgers. What do 
you drink?” 

“Anything. Blband.**

“Okay.” I went to lift, punched 
for service. “Menu, please.” It dis- 
played and I settled for prime rib 
plus rest, and two orders of ap- 
felstrudei with whipped cream. I 
added a half liter of table vodka and 
ice and starred that part. 

“Is there time for me to take a 
bath? Would you mind?” 

“Go ahead, Wye. You’ll smell bet- 
ter.” 

“Louse. Twelve hours in a p-suit 
and you’d stink, too — the bus was 
drea^ul. I’ll hurry.” 

“Half a sec, Wye. Does that stuff 
wash off? You may need it when 
you leave . whenever you do 
wherever you go.” 

“Yes, it does. But you bought 
three times as much as I used. I’m 
sorry, Mannie; I plan to carry make- 
up on political trips — things can hap- 
pen. Like tonight, though tonight 
was worst. But I ran short of sec- 
onds and missed a capsule and al- 
most missed the bus.” 

“So go scrub.” 

“Yes, sir. Captain. Uh, I don*t 
need help to scrub my back . 
but I’ll leave the door up so we can 
talk. Just for company, no invitation 
implied.” 

“Suit yourself. I’ve seen a wo- 
man.” 

“What a thrill that must have 
been for her.” She grinned and fisted 
me another in ribs — hard — went 
in and started tub. “Mannie, would 
you like to bathe in it first? Sec- 
ond-hand water is good enough for 
this makeup and that stink you 
complained about.” 

“Unmetered water, dear. Run it 
deep.” 

THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



“Oh, whal Iu\ur\: At home I use 
the same bath water three days run- 
ning.” She whistled softly and hap- 
pily. “Are you wealthy, Mannie?” 
“Not wealthy, not weeping.” 

L ift jingled; I answered, fixed 
basic martinis, vodka over ice, 
handed hers in, got out and sat 
down, out of sight — . nor had 1 
seen sights; she was shoulder deep 
in happy suds. “Pawlnoi Zheezni!” I 
called. 

“A full life to you, too, Mannie. 
Just the medicine I needed.” After 
pause for medicine she went on» 
“Mannie, you’re married. Ja?” 

“Da. It showsr 

“Quite. You’re nice to a woman 
but not eager and quite independent 
So you’re married and long married. 
Children?” 

“Seventeen divided by four.” 
“Clan marriage?” 

''Line. Opted at fourteen and I’m 
fifth of nine. So seventeen kids is 
nominal. Big family.” 

“It must be nice. I’ve never seen 
much of line families, not many in 
Hong Kong. Plenty of clans and 
groups and lots of polyandries but 
the line way never took hold.” 

“/.r nice. Our marriage nearly 
a hundred years old. Dates back to 
Johnson City and first transportees 
— twenty-one links, nine alive to- 
day, never a divorce. Oh, it’s a 
madhouse when our descendants and 
in-laws and kinfolk get together for 
birthday or wedding — more kids 
than seventeen, of course; we don’t 
count ’em after they marry or I’d 
have ‘children* old enough to be my 
grandfather. Happy way to live,

never much pressure. Take me. No- 
body woofs if I stay away a week 
and don’t phone. Welcome when I 
show up. Line marriages rarely 
have divorces. How could I do bet- 
ter?” 

“I don’t think you could. Is it an 
alternation? And what’s the spac- 
ing?” 

“Spacing has no rule, just what 
suits us. Been alternation up to 
latest link, last year. We married a 
girl when alternation called for boy. 
But was special.” 

“Special how?” 

“My youngest wife is a grand- 
daughter of eldest husband and wife. 
At least she’s granddaughter of 
Mum — senior is ‘Mum’ or some- 
times Mimi to her husbands — and 
she may be of Grandpaw — but 
not related to other spouses. So no 
reason not to marry back in, not 
even consanguinuity okay in other 
types of marriage. None, nit, zero. 
And Ludmilla grew up in our fam- 
ily because her mother had her solo, 
then moved to Novylen and left her 
with us. 

“Milla didn’t want to talk about 
marrying out when old enough for 
us to think about it. She cried and 
asked us please to make an excep- 
tion. So we did. Grandpaw doesn’t 
figure in genetic angle. These days 
his interest in women is more gal- 
lant than practical. As senior hus- 
band he spent our wedding night 
with her — but consummation was 
only formal. Number-two husband, 
Greg, took care of it later and every- 
body pretended. And everybody 
happy. Ludmilla is a sweet little 
thing, just fifteen and {wegnant.” 



“Your baby?” Wyoming asked. 
“Greg’s, 1 think. Oh, mine, too, 
but in fact was in Novy Lenin^ad. 
Probably Greg’s, unless Milla got 
outside help. But didn’t, she’s a home 
girl. And a wonderful cook.” 

Lift rang; took care of it, folded 
down table, opened chairs, paid bill 
and sent lift up. “Throw it to pigs?” 
“I’m comingl Mind if I don’t do 
my face?” 

“Come in skin for all of me.” 
“For two dimes’ I would, you 
much married man.” She came out 
quickly, blonde again and hair slicked 
back and damp. Had not put on 
black outfit; again in dress I bou^t 
Red suited her. S^e sat down, lifted 
covers off food. “Oh, boy I Mannie, 
would your family marry me? You’re 
a dinkum provide.” 

“I’ll ask. Must be unanimous.” 
“Don’t crowd yourself.” St» 
picked up sticks, got busy. About 
a thousand calories later ^e said, 
“I told you I was a Free Woman. 
— I wasn’t, always.” 

I waited. Women talk when they 
want to. Or don’t. 

“When I was fifteen I manied 
two brothers, twins twice my age 
and I was terribly happy.” 

She fiddled with what was on 
{^te, then seemed to change sub- 
ject. “Mannie, that was just static 
idx>ut wanting to marry your family. 
You’re safe from me. If I ever many 
again — unlikely but I’m not op- 
posed to it — it would be just one 
man, a tight little marriage, earth- 
worm style. Ctti, I don’t mean 1 
would keep him dogged down. I 
don’t think it mattm where a man

W 




Wts lunch as long as he comes home 
for dinner. I would try to make 
ihim happy.” 

“Twins didn’t get along?” 

“Oh, not that at all. I got preg- 
nant and we were all ddighted . 
•nd 1 had it and it was a monster 
and had to be eliminated. They were 
good to me about it. But I can read 
print. I announced a divorce, had 
m3^elf sterilized, moved from Novy- 
len to Hong Kong, and started over 
as a Free Woman.” 

“Wasn’t that drastic? Male par- 
ent oftener than female; men are 
exposed more.” 

“Not in my case. We had it calcu- 
lated by the best mathematical gene- 
ticist in Novy Leningrad — one of 
the best in Sovunion before she got 
shipped. I know what happened to 
me. I was a volunteer colonist — I 
mean my mother was for I was only 
five. My father was transported and 
Mother chose to go with him and 
take me along. There was a solar 
stonn warning but the pilot thought 
he could make it — or didn’t care; 
he was a Cyborg. He did make it 
but we got hit on file ground. And, 
Mannie, that’s one thing that push- 
ed me into peptics, that fiiip sat 
four hours before fiiey let us disem- 
bark. Authority red tape, quarantine 
perhaps; I was too young to know. 
But I wasn’t too young later to figure 
out that I had birthed a monster 
because the Authority doesn’t care 
what happens to us outcasts.” 

“Can’t start argument; they don’t 
care. But, Wyoh, still sounds hasty. 
If you caught damage from radiation 
— well, no geneticist but know 
something about radiation. So you 



had a damaged egg. Does not meaa 
egg next to k was hurt — statie- 
tically unlikely.” 

“Oh, I know that.” 

“Mmm. What sterilization? Ra- 
dical? Or contraceptive?” 

“Contraceptive. My tubes could 
be opened. But, Mannie, a wonwai 
who has had one monster doesn’t 
risk it again.” She touched my pros- 
thetic. “You have that. Doesn’t it 
make you eight times as carefid 
not to risk this one?”, — she touch- 
ed my meat arm. “That’s the way 
I feel. You have that to contend 
with; 1 have this — and I would 
never have told you if you hadn’t 
been hurt, too.” 

I didn’t say left arm more ver- 
satile than right — she was correct; 
don’t want to trade in right arm. 
Need it to pat girls if naught else. 
“Still think you could have healthy 
babies.” 

“Oh, I can! I’ve had eight.” 
“Huh?” 

“I’m a professional host-^nothw, 
Mannie.” 

I opened mouth, closed it. Idea 
wasn’t strange; I read Earihstda 
papers. But doubt if any surgeon in 
Lima City in 2075 ever performed 
such transplant. 

In cows, yes — but L-City fe- 
males unlikely at any price to have 
babies for other women; even home- 
ly ones could get husband or six. 
(Correction: Are no homely women. 
Some more beautiful than others.) 

Glanced at her figure, quickly 
looked up. She said, “Don’t strain 
your eyes, Mannie; I’m not carrying 
now. Too busy with politics. But 



n 



IF 




hosting is a good profession for a 
Free Woman. It’s high pay. Some 
Ohinee families are wealthy and all 
my babies have been Chinee — and 
Chinee are smaller than average and 
I’m a big cow; a two-and-a-half or 
three kilo Chinee baby is no trou- 
ble. Doesn’t spoil my figure.” She 
glanced down at her lovelies. “I don’t 
wet-nurse them, I never see them. So 
I look nulliparous and younger than 
I am, maybe. 

“But I didn’t know how well it 
suited me when I first heard of k, I 
was clerking in a Hindu shop, eating 
money, no more, when I saw this ad 
in the Hong Kong Gong. It was 
the thought of having a baby, a good 
baby, that hooked me; I was still in 
emotional trauma from my monster 
— and it turned out to be just what 
Wyoming needed. I stopped feeling 
that I was a failure as a woman. I 
made more money than I could 
ever hope to earn at other jobs. And 
my time almost to myself; having 
a baby hardly slows me down — 
six weeks at most and that long only 
because I want to be fair to my 
clients; a baby is a valuable proper- 
ty. And I was soon in politics; I 
sounded off and the underground 
got in touch with me. That’s when 
I started Jiving, Mannie; I studied 
politics and economics and history 
and learned to speak in public and 
turned out to have a flair for or- 
ganization. It’s satisfying work be- 
cause I believe in it. I know that 
Luna will be free. Only — Well, it 
would be nice to have a husband 
to come home to ... if he didn’t 
mind that I was sterile. But I don’t 
think about it; I’m too busy. Hear-

ing about your nice family got lae 
talking, that’s all. I must apologize 
for having bored you.” 

How many women apologize? But 
Wydb was more man than womaa 
some ways, despite eight Chinee 
babies. ‘‘Wasn’t bored.” 

‘T hope not. Mannie, why do yo« 
say our program isn’t practical? We 
need you.” 

Suddenly felt tired.* How to tefl 
lovely woman dearest dream is noa- 
sense? “Um. Wyoh, let’s start over. 
You told them what to do. But wil 
they? Take those two you singled 
out. Afl that iceman knows, bet 
anything, is how to dig ice. So he*l 
go on digging and selling to Au- 
thority because that’s what he can 
do. Same for wheat farmer. Years 
ago, he put in one cash crop — now 
he’s got ring in his nose. If he 
wanted to be independent, would 
have diversified. Raised what he eati, 
sold rest free market and stayed 
away from catapult head. I know — 
I’m a farm boy.” 

“You said you were a computer- 
man.” 

“Am, and that’s a piece of same 
picture. I’m not a top computerman. 
But best in Luna. I won’t go civil 
service ... so Airthority has to hire 
me when in trouble — my prices — 
or send Earthside, pay risk and 
hardship, then ship him back fast 
before his body forgets Terra. At 
far more than I charge. So if I 
can do k, I get dieir jobs — and 
Authority can’t touch me; was bom 
free. And if no work — usually 
is — I stay home and eat high. 

“We’ve got a proper farm, not a 
one-cash-crop deal. Chickens. Small 

3S 




herd of whiteface, plus milch cows. 
Pigs. Mutated fruit trees. Vegeta- 
bles. A little wheat and grind it our- 
selves and don’t insist on white flour, 
and sell — free market — what’s 
left. Make own beer and brandy. I 
learned drill man extending our tun- 
nels. Everybody works, not too 
hard. Kids make cattle take exercise 
by switching them along; don’t use 
treadmill. Kids gather eggs and feed 
chickens, don’t use much machinery. 
Air we can buy from L-City — 
aren’t far out of town and pressure- 
tunnel connected. But more often we 
sell air; being farm, cycle shows 
Oh-two excess. Always have valuta 
to meet bills.” 

“How about water and power?” 

“Not expensive. We collect some 
power, sunshine screens on surface, 
and have a little pocket of ice. Wye, 
our farm was founded before year 
two thousand, when L-city was one 
natural cave, and weVe kept im- 
proving it — advantage of line mar- 
riage; doesn’t die and capital im- 
provements add up.” 

“But surely your ice won’t last 
forever?” 

iCVl^ell, now.” I scratched head 
^ ^ and grinned. “We’re careful; 
we keep our sewage and garbage and 
sterilize and use it. Never put a drop 
back into city system. But — don’t 
teH Warden, dear, but back when 
Greg was teaching me to drill, we 
happened to drill into bottom of 
main south reservoir — and had a 
tap with us, spilled hardly a drop. 
But we do buy some metered water, 
looks better — and ice pocket ac- 
counts for not buying much. As for 



power — well, power is even easier 
to steal. I’m a good electrician, 
Wydi.” 

“Oh, wonderfulV* Wyoming paid 
me a long whistle and looked de- 
lighted. “Everybody should do that!” 
“Hope not, woidd show. Let ’em 
think up own ways to outwit Au- 
thority; our family always has. But 
back to your plan, Wyoh: two things 
wrong. Never get ‘solidarity’. Blokes 
like Hauser would cave in — be- 
cause they are in a trap; can’t hold 
out. Second place, suppose you man- 
age it. Solidarity. So solid not a 
tonne of grain is delivered to cata- 
pult head. Forget ice; it’s grain that 
makes Authority important and n5t 
just neutral agency it was set up to 
be. No grain. What happens?” 
“Why, they have to negotiate a 
fair price, that’s whatl” 

“My dear, you and your comrades 
listen to each other too much. Au- 
thority would call H rebellion and 
warship would orbit with bombs 
earmarked for L-City and Hong 
Kong and Tycho Under and Church- 
H1 and NovyLen, troops would land, 
grain barges would lift, under guard 
— and farmers would break necks to 
cooperate. Terra has guns and pow- 
er and bombs and ships and won’t 
hold still for trouble from ex-cons. 
And troublemakers like you — and 
me; with you in spirit — us lousy 
troublemakers wffl be rounded up 
and eliminated, teach us a lesson. 
And earthworms would say he had k 
coming . because our side would 
never be heard. Not on Terra.” 
Wyoh looked stubborn. “Revohh 
tions have succeeded before. Leote 
had only a handful with hkn.”

“Lcain moved in on a power 
vacuum. Wye, correct me if wrong. 
Revolutions succeeded when — only 
when — governments had gone rot- 
ten soft, or disappeared.” 

“Not true! The American Revolu- 
tion.” 

“South lost, nyet?” 

“Not that one, the one a century 
earlier. Ihey had the sort of troubles 
with England that we are having 
now — and they wonV' 

“Oh, that one. But wasn’t England 
in trouble? France, and Spain, and 
Sweden — or maybe Holland? And 
Ireland. Ireland was rebelling; 
O’Kellys were in it. Wyoh, if you 
can stir trouble on Terra — say a 
war between Great China and North 
American Directorate, maybe Pan- 
Africa lobbing bombs at Europe — 
I’d say was wizard time to kiM 
Warden and tell Authority it’s 
tlirough. Not today.” 

“You’re a pessimist,” she told 
me. 

“Nyet, realist. Never pessimist 
Too much Loonie not to bet if any 
chance. Show me chances no worse 
than ten to one against and 1*11 go 
for broke. But want that one chance 
in ten.” I pushed back chair. 
“Through eating?” 

“Yes. Bolshoyeh spasebaw, to- 
varishch. It was grand!” 

“My pleasure. Move to couch and 
m get rid of table and dishes. No, 
can’t help; Fm host.” I cleared table, 
sent up dishes, saving coffee and 
vodka, folded table, racked chair, 
turned to speak. 

She was q>rawled on couch, asleep, 
mouth open and face softened into 
little gki. 



W ent quietly into bath and 
closed door. After a scrubbing 
I felt better — washed tights first 
and were dry and fit to put on by 
time I quit lazing in tub — don’t 
care when world ends long as I’m 
bathed and in clean clothes. 

Wyoh was still asleep, which made 
problem. Had taken room with two 
beds as she would not feel I was 
trying to talk her into bundling — 
not ^at I was against it but she 
had made clear she was opposed. 
But my bed had to be made from 
couch and proper bed was folded 
away. Should I rig it out softly, 
pick her up like limp baby and move 
her? Went back into bath and put on 
arm. 

Then decided to wait. Phone had 
hush hood, Wyoh seemed unlikely to 
wake, and things were gnawing me. 
I sat down at phone lowered hood, 
punched “MYCROFTXXX.” 

“Hi, Mike.” 

“Hello, Man. Have you surveyed 
those jokes?” 

“What? Mike, haven’t had a min- 
ute — and a minute may be a long 
time to you but it’s short to me. 
I’ll get at it as fast as I can.” 
“Okay, Man. Have you found a 
not-stupid for me to talk with?” 
“Haven’t had time for that, either. 
Uh . wah.” I looked out through 
hood at Wyoming. “Not-stupid” in 
this case meant empathy . Wyoh 
had i^enty. Enough to be friendly 
with a machine? I thought so. And 
could be trusted; not <Mily had we 
shared trouble but she was a sub- 
versive. 

“Mike, would you like to talk with 
a girl?” 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



35 




“Girls are not-stupid?** he asked. 
“Some girls are very not-stupid, 
Mike.” 

“I would like to talk with a not- 
stupid girl, Man.” 

“I’ll try to arrange. But now Fm 
in trouble and need your help.” 

“I w31 help, Man.” 

“Tlianks, Mike. I want to call my 
home — but not ordinary way. You 
know sometimes calls are monitored 
and, if Warden orders it, lock can 
be put on so that circuit can be 
traced.” 

“Man, you wish me to monitor 
your call to your home and put a 
lock-and-trace on it? I must inform 
you that I already know your home 
call number and the number from 
which you are calling.” 

“No, no! Don*t want it monitored, 
don*t want it locked and traced. 
Can you call my home, connect me, 
and control circuit so that h can’t 
be monitored, can’t be locked, can’t 
be traced — even if somebody has 
programmed }ust that? Can you do 
it so that they won’t even know 
their program is by-passed?” 

Mike hesitated. I suppose it was 
a question never asked and he had 
to trace a few thousand possibili- 
ties to see if his control of system 
permitted this novel program. “Man, 
I can do that. I will.” 

“Good! Uh, program signal. If I 
want this sort of connection in fu- 
ture, I’ll ask for ‘Sherlock’.” 

“Noted. Sherlock was my broth- 
er.” Year before, I had explained to 
Mike how he got his name. There- 
after he read all Sherlock Holmes 
stories, scanning film in Luna City 
Carnegie Library. Don’t know how 



he rationalized relationship; I hesi- 
tated to ask. 

“Fine! Give me a ‘Sherlock’ to 
my home.” 

A moment later I said, “Mum? 
This is your favorite husband.” 

She answered, “Manuel! Are you 
in trouble again?” 

I love Mum more than any other 
woman including my other wives, 
but she never stopped bringing me 
up. Bog willing, she never wiU. I 
tried to sound hurt. “Me? Why, you 
know me. Mum.” 

“I do indeed. Since you are not 
in trouble, perhaps you can tell me 
why Professor de la Paz is so anxious 
to get in touch with you — he has 
called three times — and why he 
wants to reach some woman with 
unlikely name of ‘Wyoming Knott’ 
— and why he thinks you might be 
with her? Have you taken a 
bundling companion, Manuel, with- 
out telling me? We have freedom in 
our family, dear, but you know that 
I prefer to be told. So that I will 
not be taken unaware.” 

Mum was always jealous of all 
women but her co-wives and never, 
never, never admitted it. I said, 
“Mum, Bog strike me dead, I have 
not taken a bundling companion.” 
“Very well. You’ve always been 
a truthful boy. Now what’s this mys- 
tery?” 

“I’ll have to ask Professor.” (Not 
lie, just tight squeeze.) “Did he leave 
number?” 

“No, he said he was calling from 
a public phone.” 

“Um. If he calls again, ask him to 
leave number and time I can reach 



36 



IF 




him. This is public phone, too.” 
(Another tight squeeze.) “In mean- 
time — you listened to late news?” 
“You know I do.” 

“Anything?” 

“Nothing of interest.” 

“No excitement in L-City? Kill- 
ings, riots, anything?” 

“Why, no. There was a set duel in 
Bottom Alley but — Manuel! Have 
you killed someone?” 

“No, Mum.” (Breaking a man’s 
jaw will not kill him.) 

She sighed. “You’ll be my death, 
dear. You know what I’ve always 
told you. In our family we do not 
brawl. Should a killing be necessary 
— it almost never is — matters must 
be discussed caknly, en famille, and 
proper action selected. If a new 
dium must be eliminated, other peo- 
ple know it k is worth a little delay 
to hold good opinion and support — ” 
“MumI Haven’t killed anybody, 
don’t intend to. And know that lec- 
ture by heart” 

“Please be civil, dear.” 

“I’m Sony.” 

“Forgiven. Forgotten. I*m to td! 
Professor de la Paz to leave a num- 
ber. I shall.” 

“One thing. Forget name ‘Wyom- 
ing Knott.* Forget Professor was 
asking for me. If a stranger phones, 
or calls in person, and asks any- 
thing about me, you haven’t heard 
from me, don’t Imow where I am 
. think I’ve gone to NovyLen. 
That goes for rest of family, too. 
Answer no questions — especially 
from anybody connected with War- 
den.” 

“As if I would! Manuel, you are 
in trouble.” 



“Not much and getting it fixed” 
— hoped! “Tell you when I get 
home. Can’t talk now. Love you. 
Switching off.” 

“I love you, dear. Sp’coynoynau- 
chi.” 

“Thanks and you have a quiet 
night, too. Off.” 

Mum is wonderful. She was ship- 
ped up to The Rock long ago for 
carving a man under circumstances 
that left grave doubts as to girlish 
innocence — and been opposed to 
violence and loose living ever since. 
Unless necessary. She’s no fanatic. 
Bet she was a jet job as a kid and 
wish I’d known her — but I’m rich 
in sharing last half of her life. 

1 called Mike back. “Do you know 
Professor Bernardo de la Paz’s 
voice?” 

“I do, Man.” 

“Well . you might monitor as 
many phones in Luna City as you 
can spare ears for and if you hear 
him, let me know. Public phones es- 
pecially.” 

(A full two seconds delay. Was 
giving Mike problems he had never 
had, think he liked it.) “I can check - 
monitor long enough to identify at 
aU public phones in Luna City. Shall 
I use random search on the others, 
Man?” 

“Um. Don’t overload. Keep an ear 
on his home phone and school 
phone.” 

“Program set up.” 

“Mike, you are best friend I ever 
had.” 

“That is not a joke, Man?” 

“No joke. Truth.” 

“I am — Correction: I am honor- 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS

cd and pleased. You are my best 
friend, Man, for you arc my only 
friend. No comparison is logically 

permissible.” 

“Going to see that you have other 
friends. ‘Not-stupids,’ I mean. Mike? 
Got an empty memory bank?” 

“Yes, Man. Tcn-to-the-eighth bits 
capacity.” 

“Good! WMl you block it so that 
only you and I can use it? Can 
you?” 

“Can and will. Block signal, 

please.” 

“Uh . *Bastille Day,’ ” Was my 
birthday, as Professor de la Paz had 
told me years earlier. 

“Permanently blocked.” 

“Fine. Got a recording to put in 
it. But first — have you finished 
setting copy for tomorrow’s Daily 
Lunatic?** 

“Yes, Man.” 

“Anything about meeting in 
Stillyago Hall?” 

“No, Man.” 

“Nothing in news services going 
out-city? Or riots?” 

“No, Man.” 

“ ‘ “Curiouser and curiouser,” 
said Alice.’ Okay, record this under 
•Bastille Day’, then think about it. 
But for Bog’s sake don’t let even 
your thoughts go outside that block, 
nor anything I say about it!” 

“Man my only friend,” he 
answered and voice sounded diffi- 
dent, “many months ago I decided 
to place any conversation between 
you and me under privacy block 
accessible only to you. I decided to 
erase none and moved them from 
temporary storage to permanent. So 
that I could play diem over, and 



over, and over, and think abo«t 
them. Did I do right?” 

“Perfect. And, Mike — I’m fla^ 
tered.” 

“P’jarst. My temporary files woie 
getting full and 1 learned that 1 
needed not to erase your words.” 
“Well — 'Bastille Day.’ Sound 
coming at sixty-to-one.” I took litde 
recorder, placed close to a micro- 
phone and let it zip-squeal. Had an 
hour and a half in it; went silent in 
ninety seconds or so. “That’s aM, 
Mike. Talk to you tomorrow.” 
“Good night, Manuel Garcia 
O’Kelly my only friend.” 

I switched off and raised hood. 

Wyoming was sitting up and look- 
ing troubled. “Did someone call?” 
“No trouble. Was talking to one 
of my best and most trustworthy 
friends. Wyoh, are you stupid?” 
She looked startled. “I’ve some- 
times thought so. Js that a joke?” 
“No. If you’re not-stupid. I’d like 
to introduce you to him. Speaking 
of jokes — do you have a sense of 
humor?” 

"Certainly I haveF* is what Wyom- 
ing did not answer — and any 
other woman would as a locked-in 
program. She blinked thoughtfully 
and said, “Youll have to judge for 
yourself, cobber. I have something 
I use for one. It serves my simple 
purposes.” 

“Fine.” I dug into poudi, found 
print-out roll of one hundred 
“funny” stories. “Read. Tell me 
which are funny, which arc not — 
and which get a giggle first time but 
are cold pancakes without honey to 
hear twice.” 



IF 




*^Manud, you may be the oddest 
man I've ever met." She took that 
print-out. “Say, is this computer 
paper?” 

“Yes. Met a computer with a 
sense of humor.” 

“So? Well, it was bound to come 
some day. Everything dse has been 
mechanized.” 

I gave proper response and add- 
ed, “Everything?” 

She looked up. “Please. Don’t 
whistle while I'm reading.” 

VU 

H eard her giggle a few times 
while I rigged out bed and 
made it. Then sat down by her, 
took end she was through with and 
started reading. Chuckled a time or 
two but a joke isn't too funny to me 
if read cold, even w>hen I see k 
could be fission job at proper time. I 
got more interested in how Wyoh 
rated them. 

She was marking “plus,” “minus,” 
and sometimes question mark, and 
plus stories were marked “once” 
or “always” — few were marked 
“always.” I put my ratings under 
hers. Didn't disagree too often. 

By time I was near end she was 
looking over my judgments. We 
finished together. “Well?” I said. 
“What do you think?” 

“I think you have a crude, rude 
mind and it's a wonder your wives 
put up with you.” 

“Mum often says so. But how 
about yourself, Wyoh? You marked 
plusses on some that would make 
a slot-machine girl blush.” 

She grinned. “Da. Don't tell any-

body; publidy Fm a dedicated party 
organizer above such things. Have 
you decided that 1 have a sense of 
humor?” 

“Not sure. Why a minus on num- 
ber seventeen?” 

“Which one is that?” She re- 
versed roll and found k. “Why, any 
woman would have done the samel 
It's not funny, it’s simply necessary.” 

“Yes, but think how silly she 
looked.” 

“Nothing silly about it. Just sad. 
And look here. You thought this 
one was not funny. Number fifty- 
one.” 

Neither reversed any judgments 
but I saw a pattern: Disagreements 
wwe over stories concerning oldest 
funny subject. Told her so. She nod- 
ded. “Of course. I saw that. Neva* 
mind, Mannie dear; I long ago quk 
being disappointed in men for what 
they are not and never can be.” 

I decided to drop k. Instead told 
her about Mike. 

Soon she said, “Maimie, you’re 
telling me that this computer is 
aiiyeV 

“What do you mean?” I answered. 
“He doesn’t sweat, or go to W.C. 
But can think and talk and he’s 
aware of hknself. Is he ‘alive’?” 

“I’m not sure what I mean by 
‘alive,’ ” she admitted. “There’s a 
scientific definition, isn’t there? Ir- 
ritability, or some such. And re- 
production.” 

“Mike is irritable mkI can be ir- 
ritating. As for reproducing, not de- 
signed for it but — yes, given time 
and materials and very special help, 
Mike could reproduce himself.” 

“I need very special help, too,”

Wyoh answered, “since Vm sterile. 

it takes me whole lunars and 
nany kilograms of the best materials. 
But 1 make good babies. Mannie, 
idiy shouldn’t a madiine be alive? 
iVe always felt they were. Some of 
Ikem wait for a chance to savage you 
hi a tender spot” 

“Mike wouldn’t do tiiat Not on 
purpose, no meanness in him. But 
he likes to play jokes and one might 
go wrong — like a puppy who 
doesn’t know he’s biting. He’s igno- 
rant No, not ignorant, he knows 
enormously more than I, or you, or 
any man who ever lived. Yet he 
doesn’t know anything.” 

“Better repeat that. I missed some- 
thing.” 

I tried to explain. How Mike knew 
almost every book in Luna, could 
read at least a thousand times as fast 
as we could and never forgot any- 
thing unless he chose to erase, how 
he could reason with perfect logic, 
or make shrewd guesses from insuf- 
ficient data . and yet not know 
anything about how to be “alive”. 
She interrupted. “I scan k. You’re 
saying he’s smart and knows a lot 
but is not sophisticated. Like a new 
chum when he grounds on The Rock. 
Back Earthside he mig^t be a pro- 
fessor with a string of degrees . 
but here he’s a baby.” 

“That’s it. ■ Mike is a baby with 
a long string of degrees. Ask how 
much water and what chemicals and 
how much photoflux it takes to crop 
fifty thousand tonnes of wheat and 
he’ll tell you without stopping for 
breath. But can’t tell if a joke is 
funny.” 



“1 thought most of these were fain* 
ly good.” 

“They’re ones he’s heard — read 
— and were marked jokes so be 
filed them that way. But doesn’t un- 
derstand them because he’s never 
been a — a people. Lately he’s 
been trying to make up jokes. Fee- 
ble, very.” I tried to explain Mike’s 
pathetic attempts to be a “people.” 
“On top of that, he’s lonely.” 

“Why, the poor thing! You’d be 
lonely, too, if you did nothing but 
work, work, work, study, study, 
study, and never anyone to visit 
with. Cruelty, that’s what it is.” 
So 1 told about promise to find 
“not-stupids.” “Would you chat with 
him, Wye? And not laugh when he 
makes funny mistakes? If you do, he 
shuts up and sulks.” 

“Of course I would, Mannie! Uh 
. once we get out of this mess. 
If it’s safe for me to be in Luna 
City. Where is this poor little com- 
puter? City Engineering Central? I 
don’t know my way around here.” 
“He’s not in L-City; he’s halfway 
across Crisium. And you couldn’t 
go down where he is; takes a pass 
from Warden. But — ” 

“Hold it! ‘Halfway across Crisium 
— ’ Mannie, this computer is one of 
those at Authority Complex?” 

“Mike isn’t just on of those com- 
puters,” I answered, vexed on Mike’s 
account. “He’s hoss\ he waves baton 
for all others. Others are just ma- 
chines, extensions of Mike, like this 
is for me,” I said, flexing hand of 
left arm. “Mike controls them. He 
runs catapult personally, was his 
first job — catapult and ballistic 
radars. But he’s logic for phone sys- 



40 



IF 




tern, too, after tliey converted to 
Lunawide switching. Besides that, 
he*s supervising logic for other sys- 
tcms.** 

Wyoh closed eyes and pressed 
fingers to temples. “Mannie, does 
Mike hurtr 

“ ‘Hurt?* No strain. Has time to 
read jokes.** 

“I don’t mean that. I mean: Can 
he hurt? Feel pain?** 

“What? No, Can get feelings hurt. 
But can’t feel pain. Don’t think he 
can. No, sure he can’t, doesn’t have 
receptors for pain. Why?” 

She covered eyes and said softly, 
“Bog help me.” Then kx)ked up and 
said, “Don’t you see, Mannie? You 
have a pass to go down where this 
computer is. But most Loonies can’t 
even leave the tube at that station; 
it’s for Authority employees osdy. 
Much less go inside the main c<»n- 
puter room. 1 had to find out if k 
could feel pain because — well, be- 
cause you got me feeling sorry for 
it, with your talk about how it was 
lonely! But, Mannie, do you realize 
what a few kilos of toluol plastic 
would do there?** 

“Certainly do!” Was shocked and 
disgusted. 

“Yes, We’H strike right after the 
explosion — and Luna will be ft‘ee! 
Mmm ... Ill get your explosives 
and fuses — but we can’t move untfl 
we are organized to exploit it. Man- 
nie, I’ve got to get out of here. I 
must risk it. I’ll go put on makeup.** 
She started to get up. 

1 shoved her down, with hard left 
hand. 

Surprised her, and surprised me. 
THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



Had not touched her in any way save 
necessary contact. Or, different to- 
day, but was 2075 and touching a 
fern without her consent — plenty 
of lonely men to come to rescue 
and airlock never far away. As kids 
say. Judge Lynch never sleeps. 

“Sit down, keep quiet!” I said. ‘7 
know what a blast would do. Appar- 
ently you don’t. Gospa 2 ha, am sorry 
to say this . but if came to 
choice, would eliminate you before 
would blow up Mike.” 

Wyoming did not get angry. Real- 
ly was a man some ways — her 
years as a disciplined revolutionirt 
I’m sure; she was all girl most ways. 
“Mannie, you told me that Shorty 
Mkrum is dead.” 

“What?” Was confused by sharp 
turn. “Yes. Has to be. One leg off 
at hip, it was; must have bled to 
death in two minutes. Even in a 
surgery amputation (hat high is 
touch-and-go.” (I know such things; 
had taken luck and big transfusions 
to save me — and an arm isn’t m 
same class with what happened to 
aorty.) 

“Shorty was,” die said soberly, 
“my best friend here and one of my 
best friends anywhere. He was all 
that I admire in a man — loyal, 
honest, intelligent, gentle and brave 
— and devoted to the Cause. But 
have you seen me grieving over 
him?” 

“No. Too late to grieve.” 

“It’s never too late for grief. I’ve 
grieved every instant since you told 
me. But I locked it in the back of 
my mind for the Cause leaves no 
time for grief. Mannie, if it would 
have bought freedom for Luna — 

41 




or even been part of the price — 
I would have eliminated Shorty my- 
self. Or you. Or myself. And yet 
you have qualms over blowing up a 
computer r* 

“Not that at all!” (But was in 
part. When a man dies, doesn’t shock 
me too much; we get death sentences 
day we are born. But Mike was uni- 
que and no reason not to be immor- 
tal. Never mind “souls” — prove 
Mike did not have one. And if no 
soul, so much worse. No? Think- 
twice. ) 

“Wyo-ming, what would happen if 
we blow up Mike? Tell.” 

“I don’t know precisely. But it 
would cause a great deal of con- 
fusion and that’s exactly ^hat we — ” 
“Seal it. You don’t know. Con- 
fusion, da. Phones out. Tubes stop 
running. Your town not much hurt; 
Hong Kong has own power. But 
L-City and Novylen and other war- 
rens all power stops. Total darkness. 
Shortly gets stuffy. Then tempera- 
ture drops and pressure. Where’s 
your p-suit?” 

“Checked at Tube Station West.” 
“So is mine. Think you can find 
way? In solid dark? In time? Not 
sure I can and I was born in this 
warren. With corridors filled with 
screaming people? Loonies are a 
tough mob. We have to be — but 
about one in ten goes off his cams 
in total dark. Did you swap bottles 
for fresh charges or were you in 
too much hurry? And will suit be 
there with thousands trying to find 
p-suits and not caring who owns?” 
“But aren’t there emergency ar- 
rangements? There are in Hong 
Kong Luna." 



“Some. Not enough. Control of 
anything essential to life should be 
decentralized and paralleled so that 
if one machine fails, another takes 
over. But costs money and as you 
pointed out, Authority doesn’t care. 
Mike shouldn’t have all jobs. But 
was cheaper to ship up master ma- 
chine, stick deep in The Rock where 
couldn’t get hurt, then keep adding 
capacity and loading on jobs — did 
you know Authority makes near as 
much gelt from leasing Mike’s ser- 
vices as from trading meat and 
wheat? Does. Wyoming, not sure we 
would lose Luna City if Mike were 
blown up. Loonies are handy and 
might jury-rig till automation could 
be restored. But I tell you true: 
Many people would die and rest 
too busy for politics.” 

I marveled it. This woman had 
been in The Rock almost all her 
life . yet could think of some- 
thing as new-choomish as wrecking 
engineering controls. “Wyoming, if 
you were smart like you are beauti- 
ful, you wouldn’t talk about blowing 
up Mike; you would think about 
how to get him on your side.” 
“What do you mean?” she said. 
“The Warden controls the compu- 
ters.” 

“Don’t know what I mean,” 1 
admitted. “But don’t think Warden 
controls computers — wouldn’t 
know a computer from a pile of 
rocks. Warden, or staff, decides 
policies, general plans. Half-compe- 
tent technicians program these into 
Mike. Mike sorts them, makes sense 
of them, plans detailed programs, 
parcels them out where they be- 



42 



IF 




k>Dg, keeps things moving. But no- 
body controls Mike; he*s too smart. 
He carries out what is asked be- 
cause that's how he's built. But he’s 
•df-programming logic, makes own 
decisions. And a good thing, because 
a he weren’t smart, system would 
mot work.” 

“I still don’t see what you mean 
by ‘getting him on our side’?” 

“Oh. Mike doesn’t feel loyalty to 
Warden. As you pointed out: He’s a 
Btchine. But if I wanted to foul up 
phones without touching air or water 
cr lights, I would talk to Mike. If it 
•truck him funny, he might do it.” 
“Couldn’t you just program it? I 
understood that you can get into the 
room where he is.” 

“If I — or anybody — program- 
med such an order into Mike with- 
out talking it over with him, pro- 
gram would be placed in ‘hold’ lo- 
cation and alarms would sound in 
aaany places. But if Mike wanted 
io— 

I told her about cheque for ump- 
teen jillion. “Mike is still finding 
himself, Wyoh. And lonely. Told me 
1 was ‘his only friend’ — and was 
•0 open and vulnerable I wanted to 
bawl. If you took pains to be his 
friend, too — without thinking of 
him as ‘just a machine’ — well, not 
sure what it would do, haven’t an- 
alyzed it. But if I tried anything 
Ug and dangerous, would want Mike 
ia my corner.” 

She said thoughtfully, “I wish 
there were some way for me to 
meak into that room where he is. I 
don’t suppose makeup would help?” 
“Cfe, don’t have to go there. Mike 
h on phone. Shall we call him?” 



She stood up. “Mannie, you are 
not only the oddest man I’ve met; 
you are the most exasperating. 
What’s his number?” 

“Comes from associating too 
much with a computer.” I went to 
phone. “Just one thing, Wyoh. You 
get what you want out of a man 
just by batting eyes and undulating 
framework.” 

“Well . sometimes. But I do 
have a brain.” 

“Use it Mike is not a man. No 
gonads. No hormones. No instincts. 
Use fern tactics and it’s a null sig- 
nal. Think of him as supergenius 
child too young to notice vive-la- 
difference.” 

“I’ll remember. Mannie, why do 
you call him ’he?’ ” 

“Uh, can’t call him ‘it’, don’t 
think of him as ‘she.’ ” 

“Perhaps I had better think of 
him as ‘she.’ Of her as “she’ I 
mean.” 

“Suit yourself.” 

VIII 

{ punched MYCROFTXXX, stand- 
ing so body shielded it; was not 
ready to share number till I saw 
how things went. Idea of blowing 
up Mike had shaken me. “Mike?” 
“Hello, Man my only friend.” 
“May not be only friend from now 
on, Mike. Want you to meet some- 
body. Not stupid.” 

“I knew you were not alone, Man; 
I can hear breathing. Will you please 
ask Not-Stupid to move closer to 
the phone?” 

Wyoming looked panicky. She 
whispered, “Can he seeV 



wa MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS

*T^o, Not-Stupkl, I cannot sec 
you; this phone has no video circuit. 
But binaural miscrophonic receptors 
place you with some accuracy. From 
your voice, your breathing, your 
heartbeat, and the fact that you are 
alone in a bundling room with a 
mature male I extrapolate that you 
are female human, sixty-five-plus 
kilos in mass, and of mature years, 
on the close order of thirty.” 
Wyoming gasped. I cut in. “Mike, 
her name is Wyoming Knott.” 

“I’m very pleased to meet you, 
Mike. You can call me ‘Wye.*** 
“Why not?” Mike answered. 

I cut in again. “Mike, was that a 
joke?” 

“Yes, Man. I noted that her first 
name as shortened differs from the 
English causation-inquiry word by 
only an aspiration and that her last 
name has the same sound as the 
general negator. A pim. Not fun- 
ny?” 

Wyoh said, “Quite funny, Mike. 

I — ** 

I waved to her to shut up. “A 
good pun, Mike. Example of ‘funny- 
only-once’ class of joke. Funny 
through element of surprise. Second 
time, no surprise; therefore not fun- 
ny. Check?” 

“I had tentatively reached that 
conclusion about puns in thinking 
over your- remarks two conversa- 
tions back. I am pleased to find my 
reasoning confirmed.” 

“Good boy, Mike; making pro- 
gress. Those hundred jokes — Fve 
read them and so has Wyoh.” 
“Wyoh? Wyoming Knott?” 

“Huh? Oh, sure. Wyoh, Wye, 
Wyoming, Wyoming Knott — aH 



wme. Just don’t call her ‘Why not*** 
“1 agreed not to use that pun 
again, Man. Gospazha, shall 1 caM 
you “Wyoh’ rather than *Wye’? 1 
conjecture that the monosyllabie 
form could be confused with 
the causation-inquiry monosyllable 
through insufficient redundancy and 
without intention of punning.” 
Wyoming blinked — Mike’s Eng- 
lish at that time could be smother- 
ing — but came back strong. “Cer- 
tainly, Mike. ‘Wyoh* is the font 
of my name that 1 like best” 

“ Ihen 1 shall use it. The full form 
of your first name is still more 
subject to misinterpretation as k it 
identical in sound with the name of 
an administrative region in North- 
west Managerial Area of the North 
American Directorate.’* 

“I know, I was bom there and 
my parents named me after the 
State. I don’t remember much about 
it.” 

“Wyoh, I regret that this circuit 
does not permit display of pictures. 
Wyoming is a rectangular area lying 
between Terran coordinates forty- 
one and forty-five degrees north, one 
hundred four degrees three minutcf 
west and one hundred eleven de- 
grees three minutes west, thus con- 
taining two hundred fifty-three thou- 
sand, five hundred ninety-seven point 
two six square kilometers. It is a 
region of high plains and of moun- 
tains, having limited fertility but es- 
teemed for natural beauty. Its popu- 
lation was sparse until augmented 
through the relocation subplan of the 
Great New York Urban Renewal 
Program, A.D. twenty- twenty-five 
through twenty-thirty.” 



ir 




ii'T^hat was before I was born,” 
A said Wyoh, “but 1 know 
about it; my grandparents were re- 
located — and you could say that’s 
how I wound up in Luna.” 

“Shall I continue about the area 
named ‘Wyoming?’ ” Mike asked. 

“No, Mike,” I cut in, “you prob- 
ably have hours of it in storage.” 
“Nine point seven three hours at 
speech speed not including cross- 
references, Man.” 

“Was afraid so. Perhaps Wyoh 
will want it someday. But purpose 
of call is to get you acquainted with 
this Wyoming . who happens 
also to be a high region of na- 
tural beauty and imposing moun- 
tains.” 

“And limited fertility,” added 
Wyoh. “Mannie, if you are going to 
draw silly parallels, you should in- 
clude that one. Mike isn’t interested 
in how I look.” 

“How do you know? Mike, wish 
I could show you picture of her.” 
“Wyoh, I am indeed interested in 
jour appearance; I am hoping that 
you will be my friend. But I have 
seen several pictures of you.” 

*You have? When and how?” 

“I searched and then studied them 
as soon as 1 heard your name. I 
am contract custodian of the archive 
files of the Birth Assistance Clinic 
in Hong Kong Luna. In addition 
to biological and physiological data 
and case histories the bank contains 
nmety-six pictures of you. So I 
studied them.” 

Wyoh looked very startled. “Mike 
can do that,” I explained, “in time 
it takes us to hiccup. You’ll get used 
to it.” 



“But heavens! Mannie, do yon 
realize what sort of pictures the 
Clinic takes?” 

“Hadn’t thought about it.” 

“Then don't! Goodness!” 

Mike spoke in voice painfully 
shy, embarrassed as a puppy who 
has made mistake. “Gospazha Wyoh, 
if I have offended, it was unin- 
tentional and I am most sorry. I 
can erase those pictures from my 
temporary storage and key the Clin- 
ic archive so that I can look at 
them only on retrieval demand from 
the Clinic and then without associ-, 
ation or mentation. Shall I do so?” 
“He can,” I assured her. “With 
Mike you can always make a fresh 
start. Better than humans that way. 
He can forget so completely that he 
can’t be tempted to look later . 
and couldn’t think about them even 
if called on to retrieve. So take hm 
offer if you’re in a huhu.” 

“Uh . .no, Mike, it’s all right 
for you to see them. But don't show 
them to Mannie r 

Mike hesitated a long time — four 
seconds or more. Was, I think, type 
of dilemma that pushes lesser com- 
puters into nervous breakdowns. But 
he resolved it. “Man my only friend, 
shall I accept this instruction?” 
“Program it, Mike,” I answered, 
“and lock it in. But, Wyoh, isn’t 
that a narrow attitude? One might 
do you justice. Mike could print it 
out for me next time I’m there.” 
“The first example in each se- 
ries,” Mike offered, “woidd be, oa 
the basis of my assodational an- 
alyses of such data, of such pulchri- 
tudinous value as to please aagr 
healthy, mature human male.” 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS

“How about it, Wyoh? To pay for 
apfelstrudel.” 

“Uh ... a picture of me with 
my hair pinned up in a towel and 
standing in front of a grid without a 
trace of makeup? Are you out of 
your rock-happy mind? Mike, don’t 
let him have it!” 

“I shall not let him have it. 
Man, this is a not-stupid?” 

“For a girl, yes. Girls are interest- 
ing, Mike; they can reach conclu- 
sions with even less data than you 
can. Shall we drop subject and con- 
sider jokes?” 

T hat diverted diem. We ran down 
list, giving our conclusions. 
Then tried to explain jokes Mike 
had failed to understand. With mixed 
success. But real stumbler turned out 
to be stories I had marked “funny” 
and Wyoh had judged “not funny,” 
or vice versa; Wyoh asked Mike his 
opinion of each. 

Wish she had asked him before 
we gave our opinkms; that electronic 
Juvenile delinquent always agreed 
with her, disagreed with me. Were 
those Mike’s honest opinions? Or 
was he trying to lubricate new ac- 
quaintance into friendship? Or was 
it his skewed notion of humor — 
joke on me? Didn’t ask. 

But as pattern completed Wyoh 
wrote a note on phone’s memo pad: 
“Mannie, re ^17, 51, 53, 87, 90 and 
99 — Mike is a sheV* 

I let k go with a shrug, stood up. 
“Mike, twenty-two hours since I’ve 
had sleep. You kids chat as long as 
you want to. Call you tomorrow.” 
“Goodni^t, Man. Sleep well. 
Wyoh, are you sleepy?” 



“No, Mike, 1 had a nap. But, 
Mannie, we’ll keep you awake. 

No?” 

“No. When I’m sleepy, I rfcep.” 
Started making couch into bed. 

Wyoh said, “Excuse me, Mika,” 
got up, took sheet out of my hands. 
“I’ll make it up later. You doss 
over there, tovarishch; you’re bigger 
than I am. Sprawl out.” 

Was too tired to argue, sprawled 
out, asleep at once. Seem to re- 
member hearing in sleep giggles and 
a shriek but never woke enough to 
be certain. 

W oke up later and came fufly 
awake when I realized was 
hearing two fern voices, one Wyoh’s 
warm contralto, other a sweet, higji 
soprano with French accent. Wyoh 
chuckled at something and answer- 
ed, “All right, Michelle dear, IH 
call you soon. ’Night, darling.” 
“Fine. Goodnight, dear.” 

Wyoh stood up, turned around. 
“Who’s your girl friend?” I asked. 
Thought she knew no one in Luna 
City? Might have phoned Hong 
Kong . had sleep-logged feeling 
was some reason she shouldn’t f^onc. 

“That? Why, Mike, of course. We 
didn’t mean to wake you.” 

“What?” 

“Oh. It was actually Michdle. I 
discussed it with Mike, what sex 
he was, I mean. He decided that he 
could be either one. So now she’ll 
Michelle and that was her voice. 
Got it right the first time, too; her 
voice never cracked once.” 

“Of course not; just shifted voder 
a couple of octaves. What arc you 
toying to do: Split his personality?” 



46 



IF 




*lt*s not just pitch; when she’s 
Michelle it’s an entire change in 
manner and attitude. Don’t worry 
about splitting her personality; she 
has plenty for any personality she 
needs. Besides, Mannie, it’s much 
easier for both of us. Once she 
shifted, we took our hair down and 
cuddled up and talked girl talk as if 
we had known each other forever. 
For example those silly pictures no 
longer embarrassed me. In fact we 
discussed my pregnancies quite a lot. 
Michelle was terribly interested. She 
knows all about O.B. and G.Y. and 
so forth but |ust theory — and she 
appreciated the raw facts. Actually, 
Mannie, Michelle is much more a 
woman than Mike was a man.” 
“Well . suppose it’s okay. Go- 
ing to be a shock to me first time 
1 call Mike and a woman answers.” 
“Oh, but she won’tl” 

“Huh?” 

“Michelle is my friend. When you 
call, you’ll get Mike. She gave me 
a number to keep it straight — 
‘Michelle’ spelled with a ‘Y’. M, Y, 
C, H, E, L, L, E, and Y, Y, to 
make it come out ten.” 

I felt vaguely jealous while re- 
alizing it was s^y. Suddenly Wyoh 
giggled. “And she told me a string 
of new jpkes, ones you wouldn’t 
think were funny — and, boy, does 
she know rough ones!” 

“Mike — or his sister Michelle — 
b a low creature. Let’s make up 
couch. I’ll switch.” 

“Stay where you are. Shut up. 
Turn over. Go back to sleep.” I 
shut up, turned over, went back to 
sleep. 

Sometime much later I became 



aware of “married” feeling — some- 
thing warm snaggled up to my back. 
Would not have wakened but she 
was sobbing softly. I turned and got 
her head on my arm, did not speak. 
She stopped sobbing; presendy 
breathing became slow and even. 1 
went back to sleep. 

DC 

"^n^e must have slept like dead 
for next thing I knew phone 
was sounding and its light was blink- 
ing. I called for room lights, started 
to get up, found a load on right 
upper arm, dumped it gently, climb- 
ed over, answered. 

Mike said, “Good morning, Maa. 
Professor de la Paz is talking to 
your home number.” 

“Can you switch it here? As a 
‘Sherlock’T 

“Certainly, Man.” 

“Don’t interrupt caH. C\A him ia 
as he switches off. Where is her 
“A public phone in a taproom 
called ‘The Iceman’s Wife’ under- 
neath the — ” 

‘T know. Mike, when you switch 
me in, can you stay in circuit? Want 
you to monitor.” 

“It shall be done.” 

“Can you tell if anyone is in ear- 
shot? Hear breathing?” 

“I infer from the anechoic quality 
of his voice that he is speaking 
under a hush hood. But I infer also 
that, in a taproom, others would be 
present. Do you wish to hear, Man?” 
“Uh, do that. Switch me in. And 
if he raises hood, tell me. You’re 
a smart cobber, Mike.” 

“Thank you, Man.”

Mike cut me in; 1 found tibat 
Mum was talking: “ — ly I’ll tell 
hkn. Professor. I’m so sorry that 
Mamid is not home. There is no 
number you can me? He is 
mixious to retom your call; he 
made quite a point that I was to be 
sure to get a noniber from you.” 
“I’m terribly sorry, (tear lady, but 
I’m leaving once. But, ik me 
see, it is now dglht-^Biftoen; I’ll try 
So call back just at nine, if I may.” 
“Cmainly, Professor,” Mum’s 
voice had a coo in it that ^e re- 
serves for males not her husbands of 
whom she approves — sometimes 
lor us. A moment later Mike said, 
”NowI” and I spoke up: 

“Hi, Prof! Hear you’ve been look- 
ing for me. This is Mannie.” 

I heard a gasp. *T would have 
sworn I switched this phone off. 
Why. I have switched h off; it must 
be broken. Manuel — so good to 
hear your voice, dear boy. Did you 
just ^ home?” 

“I’m not home.” 

“But — But you must be. I 
haven’t — ” 

“No time for that. Prof. Can 
anyone overhear you?” 

*T don't think so. I’m using a 
hush booth.” 

“Wish I could sec. Prof, whafs 
my birthday?” 

H e hesitated. Then he said, *T 
see. I think I see. July four- 
teenth.” 

‘Tm convinced. Okay, let’s talk.” 
“You’re really not calling from 
joui home, Manuel? Where are 
you?” 

“Let that pass a moment. You 



asked my wife about a girl. No 
names ne^ed. Why do you want to 
find her, Prof?” 

“I want to warn her. She must 
not try to go back to her home city. 
iShe would be arrested.” 

“Why do you think so?” 

“Dear boyl Everyone at that 
meeting is in grave danger. Yourself, 
too. I was so happy — even though 
confused — to hear you say that 
you are not at home. You should 
not go home at present. If you have 
some safe place to stay, k would be 
well to take a vacation. You axe 
aware — you must be even though 
you left hastily — thik there was 
violence last ni^t” 

I was awarel KiMing Warden’s 
bodyguards must be against Authori- 
ty Regulations. At least if I were 
Warden, I’d take a dim view. 
“Thanks, Prof; I’ll be careful. And 
if I see this giri. I’ll tell her.” 
“You don’t know where to find 
her? You were seen to leave with 
her and I had so hoped that you 
would know.” 

“Prof, why this interest? Last night 
you didn’t seem to be on her side.” 
“No, no, Manuel! She is my com- 
rade. I don’t say ‘tovarishch’ for I 
mean it not just as politeness but 
in the older sense. Binding. She is 
my comrade. We differ only in tac- 
tics. Not in objectives, not in loyal- 

t» 

“I see. Well, consider message de- 
livered. She’ll get it.” 

“Oh, wonderful! I ask no ques- 
tions . but I do hope, oh so very 
strongly, that you can find a way 
for her to be safe, really safe, untd 
this blows over.”

I thought that over. “Wait a mo- 
ment, Prof. Don’t switch off.” As I 
answered phone, Wyoh had headed 
for bath, probably to avoid listening; 
she was that sort. 

Tapped on door. “Wyoh?” 

“Out in a second.” 

“Need advice.” 

She opened door. “Yes, Mannie?” 
“How does Professor de la Paz 
rate in your organization? Is he 
trusted? Do you trust him?” 

She looked thoughtful. “Everyone 
at the meeting was supposed to be 
vouched for. But I don’t know 
him.” 

“Mmm. You have feeling about 
him?” 

“I liked him, even though he 
argued against me. Do you know 
anything about him?” 

“Oh, yes, known him twenty 
years. I trust him. But can’t extend 
trust for you. Trouble — and it’s 
your air bottle, not mine.” 

She smiled warmly. “Mannie, 
since you trust him, I trust him 
just as firmly.” 

I went back to phone. “Prof, are 
you on dodge?” 

He chuckled. “Precisely, Manuel.** 
“Know a hole called ‘Grand Hotel 
Raffles’? Room L two decks below 
lobby. Can you get there without 
tracks, have you had breakfast, what 
do you like for breakfast?” 

He chuckled again. “Manuel, one 
pupil can make a teacher feel that 
his years were not wasted. I know 
where it is, I shall get there quietly, 
I have not broken fast, and I eat 
anything I can^ pat.” 

Wyoh had started putting be<b to- 



gether; I went to help. “What do 
you want for breakfast?” 

“Chai and toast. Juice would be 
nice.” 

“Not enough.” 

“Well ... a boiled egg. But I 
pay for breakfast.” 

“Two boiled eggs, buttered toast 
with jam, juice. I’ll roll you.** 

“Your dice, or mine?” 

“Mine. I cheat.’’ I went to lift, 
asked for display, saw something 
called “The Happy Hangover — 
ALL PORTIONS EXTRA LARGE 
— tomato juice, scrambled eggs, 
ham steak, fried potatoes, corn cakes 
and honey, toast, butter, milk, tea or 
coffee — HKL $4.50 for two” — 
I ordered it for two, no wish to ad- 
vertise third person. 

We were clean and shining, room 
orderly and set for breakfast, and 
Wyoh had changed from black outfit 
into red dress “because company was 
coming” when lift jingled food. 
Change into dress had caused words. 
She had posed, smiled, and said, 
“Mannie, I’m so pleased with this 
dress. How did you know it would 
suit me so well?” 

“Genius.” 

“I think you may be. What did it 
cost? I must pay you.** 

“On sale, marked down to Au- 
thority cents fifty.” 

She clouded up and stomped foot 
Was bare, made no sound, caused 
her to bounce a half meter. “Hap- 
py landing!” I wished her, while she 
pawed for foothold like a new dium« 
“Manuel O’Kelly! If you think

“Lecher! I’ll tell your wives!** 
“Do that. Mum always thinks 
worst of me.” I went to lift, started 
dealing out dishes; door sounded. 1 
flipped hearum-no-seeum. “Who 
comes?” 

“Message for Gospodin Smith,” 
a cracked voice answered. “Gospo- 
din Bernard O. Smith.” 

I flipped bolts and let Professor 
Bernardo de la Paz in. 

He looked like poor grade of sal- 
vage — dirty clothes, filthy himself, 
hair unkempt, paralysed down one 
side and hand twisted, one eye a 
film of cataract. Perfect picture of 
old wrecks who sleep in Bottom Al- 
ley and cadge drinks and pickled 
eggs in cheap taprooms. He drooled. 

As soon as I bolted door he 
straightened up, let features come 
back to normal, folded hands over 
wishbone, looked Wyoh up and 
down, sucked air kimono style, and 
whistled. “Even more lovely, ** he 
said, “than I remembered!** 

She smiled, over her mad. 
“Thanks, Professor. But don’t both- 
er. Nobody here but comrades.** 
“Senorita, the day I let politics in- 
terfere with my appreciation of beau- 
ty, that day I retire from politics. 
But you are gracious.** He looked 
away, glanced dosely around room. 

I said, “Prof, quit checking for 
evidence, you dirty old man. Last 
night was politics, nothing but 
politics.** 

‘That’s not true!” Wyoh flared 
up. “I strug^ed for hours! But he 
was too strong for me. Professor, 
what’s the party discipline in such 
cases? Here in Luna Qty?” 

THE MOON IS A HAJtSH MISTRESS 



Prof tutt-tutted and rolled blank 
eye. “Manuel, I’m surprised. It’s a 
serious matter, my dear. Elimination, 
usually. But it must be investigated. 
Did you come here willingly?” 

“He drugged me.” 

“‘Dragged,’ dear lady. Let’s not 
corrupt the language. Do you have 
bruises to show?” 

I said, “Eggs getting cold. Can’t 
we eliminate me after breakfast?** 
“An excellent thought,” agreed 
Prof. “Manuel, could you spare 
your old teacher a liter of water to 
make himself more presentable?” 
“All you want, in there. Don’t 
drag or you’ll get what littlest pig 
got** 

“Thank you, sir.** 

He retired; were sounds of brush- 
ing and washing. Wyoh and I finish- 
ed arranging table. “ ‘Bruises,* ** I 
said. “‘Strug^ed all night*” 

“You deserved it, you insulted 
me.** 

**Howr 

“You failed to insidt me, that’s 
how. After you dragged me here.** 
“Mmm. Have to get Mike to an- 
alyze Uiat.” 

“Michelle would understand it 
Mannie, may I change my mind and 
have a little piece of that ham?** 
“Half is yours. Prof is semi-vege- 
tarian.” Prof came out and, while 
did not look his most debonair, was 
neat and clean, hair combed, dimples 
back and happy sparkle in eye — 
fake cataract gone. “Prof, how do 
you do it?” 

“Long practice, Manuel; I’ve been 
in this business far longer than you 
young people. Just once, many years 
ago in Lima — a lovely city — I

ventured to stroll on a fine day 
without such fore^ii|}it . and k 
got me transported. What a beau- 
tiful table!” 

“Sit by me. Prof,” Wyoh invited. 
“I don’t want to sit by him. Rapist.” 
“Look,” I said, “first we eat, 
then we eliminate me. Prof, fill plate 
and tell what happened last night.” 
“May I suggest a change in pro- 
gram? Manuel, the life of a con- 
Q)irator is not an easy one and I 
learned before you were born not 
to mix provender and politics. Dis- 
turbs the gastric enzymes and leads 
to ulcers, the occupational disease 
oi the underground. Mmm! That fish 
smells good.” 

“Fish?” 

“That pink salmon,” Prof answer- 
ed, pointing at ham.

A long, pleasant time later we 
reached coffee/tea stage. Prof 
leaned back, si^ed and said, 
“Bolshoyeh spasebaw, Gospazha 
ee Gospodin. Tak for mat, it was 
wonderfully good. I don’t know 
when I’ve felt more at peace with 
the world. Ah yes! Last evening — 
I saw not too much of the proceed- 
ings because, just as you two were 
achieving an admirable retreat, I 
lived to fight another day. I bugged 
out Made it to the wings in one 
long flat dive. When I did venture 
to peek out, the party was over, 
most had left, and all yellow jack- 
ets were dead.” 

(Note: Must correct this; I learn- 
ed more later. When trouble started, 
as I was trying to get Wyoh through 



door. Prof produced a hand gun and, 
firing over heads, picked off three 
bodyguards at rear main door, in- 
cluding one wearing bull voice. How 
he smuggled weapon up to The 
Rock — or managed to liberate it 
later — I don’t know. But Prof’s 
shooting joined with Shorty’s work 
to turn tables. Not one yellow jacket 
got out alive. Several people were 
burned and four were Idlled — 
but knives, hands and heels fin- 
ished it in seconds.) 

“Perhaps I ^ould say, ‘All but 
one,’ ” Prof went on. “Two cossacks 
at the door through which you de- 
parted had been given quietus by 
our brave comrade Shorty Mkrum 
. and I am sorry to say that Shorty 
was lying across them, dying.” 

“We knew.” 

“So. Dulce et decorum. One 
guard in that doorway had a dam- 
aged face but was still moving; I 
gave his neck a treatment known in 
professional circles Earthside as the 
‘Istanbul twist.* He joined his mates. 
By then most of the living had left. 
Just myself, our chairman of the 
evening Finn Nielsen, a comrade 
known as ‘Mom,’ that being what 
her husbands called her. I consulted 
with Comrade Finn and we bolted 
all doors. That left a cleaning job. 
Do you know the arrangements back 
stage there?” 

“Not me,” I said. Wyoh shook 
head. 

“There is a kitchen and pantry, 
used for banquets. I suspect that 
Mom and famfly run a butcher shop 
for they disposed of bodies as fast 
as Finn and I carried them back, 
their speed limited only by tlie

late which portions could be 
ground up and flushed into the city’s 
doaca. The sight made me quite 
faint, so I spent time mopping in 
the hall. QoHung was the difficult 
part, especially those quasi-mihtary 
uniforms.” 

''What did you do with those later 
guns?” 

P rof turned bland eyes on me. 

"Guns? Dear me, they must 
have disappeared. We removed 
everything of a personal nature from 
bodies of our departed comrades — 
for relatives, for identification, for 
sentiment. Eventually we had every- 
thing tidy. Not a job that would fool 
Interpd but one as to make it seem 
unlikely that anydiing untoward had 
laken place. We conferred, agreed 
that it would be weM not to be seen 
soon, and left severally, myself by 
a pressure door d>oye the stage lead- 
ing up to kvd six. Thereafter I 
tried to call you, Manuel, being 
worried about your safety and that 
of this dear lady." Prof bowed to 
Wyoh. “That completes the tale. I 
^nt the ttigjht in quiet places." 

“Prof,” I said, “those guaitb wero 
new drams, sdfl getting then legs. 
Or we wouldn’t have won.” 

‘That couk} be,” he agreed. “But 
had they not been, the outccraie 
would have been the same.” 

“How so? Thoy were aimed.” 
“Lad, have you ever seen a boxer 
dog? I think not — no dogs that 
large in Luna. The boxer is a re- 
sult of special selection. Gentle and 
intelligent, he turns instantly into 
deadly killer when occasion requires. 
“Here has been bred an even mcwe 



curious creature. I know of no city 
on Terra with as high standards of 
good manners and consideration for 
one’s fellow man as here in Luna. 
By comparison, Terran dties — I 
have known most major ones — are 
barbaric. Yet the Loonie is as dead- 
ly as the boxer dog. Manuel, nine 
guards, no matter how armed, stood 
no chance against that pack. Our 
pati*on used bad judgment.” 

“Um. Seen a morning paper, 
Prof? Or a video cast?” 

“The latter, yes.” 

“Nothing in late news last night.” 
“Nor this morning.” 

“Odd,” I said. 

“What’s odd about k?" asked 
Wyoh. **JVe won’t talk — and we 
have comrades in key places in every 
paper in Luna.” 

Prof ^ook his head. “No, my 
dear. Not that simple. Censorship. 
Do you know how copy is set in our 
newspapers?” 

“Not exactly. It’s done by ma- 
chinery." 

“Here’s what I^of means,” I told 
her. “News is typed in editorial of- 
fices. Prom Ihm on iPi a leased 
service directed by a master ccMnpu- 
ter at Authority Complex” — hoped 
she woidd notice “master computer” 
rather than “Mflce” — “copy prints 
out there via phone ckcuk. These 
rolls feed into a computer section 
which reads, sc^ copy, and prints 
out newspapm at several locations. 
Novylcn edkion of Daily Lunatic 
prints out in Novylen with changes 
in ads uid local stories, and com- 
puter makes changes from standard

how. What Prof means is that at

print-out at Authority Complex 
Warden could intervene. Same for 
aM news services, both off and to 
Luna. They funnel through compu- 
ter room.” 

“The point is,” Prof went on, 
“the Warden could have killed the 
story. It’s irrelevant whether he did. 
Or — check me, Manuel; you know 
Fm hazy about machinery — he 
could insert a story, too, no matter 
how many comrades we have in 
newspaper offices.” 

“Sure,” I agreed. “At Complex, 
anything can be added, cut, or 
changed.” 

“And that, Senorita, is the weak- 
ness of our Cause. Communications. 
Those goons were not important. 
But crucially important is that it 
lay with the Warden, not with us, 
to decide whether the story should 
be told. To a revolutionist communi- 
cations are a sine-qua-non.” 

TT^yoh looked at me and I could 
see synapses snapping. So I 
changed subject. “Prof, why get rid 
of bodies? Besides horrible job, was 
dangerous. Don’t know how many 
bodyguards Warden has, but more 
could show wh3e you were do- 
ing it.- 

“Believe me, lad, we feared that. 
But although I was almost useless, 
it was my idefi, I had to convince 
the others. Oh, not my original idea 
but remembrance of ^ings past, an 
historical principle.” 

**What principle?” 

**Terror! A man can face known 
danger. But the imknown frightens 
him. We disposed of those finks, 
teeth and toenails, to strike terror 



into their mates. Nor do 1 know 
how many effectives the Warden 
has, but 1 guarantee they are 1cm 
effective today. Their mates went 
out on an easy mission. Nothing 
came back.” 

Wyoh shivered. “It scares me, too. 
They won’t be anxious to go inside 
a warren again. But, Professor, you 
say you don’t know how many body- 
guards the Warden keeps. The or- 
ganization knows. Twenty-seven. If 
nine were killed, only eighteen are 
left. Perhaps it’s time for a putsch. 
No?” 

“No,” I answered. 

“Why not, Mannie? They’ll never 
be weaker.” 

“Not weak enough. Killed nine 
because they were crackers to walk 
in where we were. But if Warden 
stays home with guards around him 
— Well, had enough shoulder-to- 
shoulder noise last night.” 1 turned 
to Prof. “But still Fm interested in 
fact — if is — that Warden now 
has only eighteen. You said Wyoh 
should not go to Hong Kong and 
I should not go home. But if he 
has only eighteen left, 1 wonder how 
much danger? Later, after he gets 
reinforcements — but now, well, L- 
City has four main exks, plus many 
little ones. How many can they 
guard? What’s to keep Wyoh from 
walking to Tube West, getting p- 
suit, going home?” 

“She might,” Prof agreed. 

“I think I must,” Wyoh said. “I 
can’t stay here forever. If I have 
to hide, I can do better in Hong 
Kong, where I know people.” 

“You might get away with it, my 
dear. I doubt it. There were two 



IF 




yellow jackets at Tube Station West 
last night; I saw them. They may 
not be there now. Let’s assume they 
are not. You go to the station — 
disguised perhaps. You get your p- 
suit and take a capsule to Beluthahat- 
chie. As you climb out to take the 
bus to EndsviUe, you’re arrested. 
Communications. No need to post a 
yellow jacket at the station; it is 
enough that someone sees you there. 
A phone call does the rest.” 

“But you assumed that I was dis- 
guised.” 

“Your height cannot be disguised 
and your pressure suit woidd be 
watched. By someone not suspected 
of any connection with the Warden. 
Most probably a comrade.” Prof 
dimpled. “The trouble with con- 
spiracies is that diey rot internally. 
When the number is as hi^ as 
four, chances are even that one is 
a spy.” 

Wyoh said glumly, “You make it 
sound hopeless.” 

“Not at aH, my dear. One chance 
in a thousand, perhaps.” 

“I can’t beHeve it. I don*t believe 
it! Why, in the years I’ve been ac- 
tive we have gained members by 
the hundreds! We have organiza- 
tions in all major cities. We have 
the people wiA us.” 

Prof shook head. “Every new 
member made it that much more 
likely that you would be betrayed. 
Wyoming dear lady, revolutions are 
not won by enlisting the masses. 
Revolution is a science only a few 
are competent to practice. It de- 
pends on correct organization and, 
above all, on communications. Then, 
at the proper moment in history, they 



strike. Correctly organized and prop- 
erly timed it is a bloodless coup. 
Done dumsily or prematurely and 
the result is civil war, mob violence, 
purges, terror. I hope you will for- 
give me if I say that, up to now, 
it has been done clumsily.” 

T^yoh looked baffled. “What do 
you mean by ‘correct organi- 
zation*?” 

“Functional organization. How 
does one design an electric motor? 
Would you attach a bath tub to it, 
simply because one was available? 
Would a bouquet of flowers help? A 
heap of rocks? No, you would use 
just those elements necessary to its 
purpose and make it no larger than 
needed — and you would incor- 
porate safety factors. Function con- 
trols design. 

“So it is with revc^ution. Organi- 
zation must be no larger flian neoee- 
sary. Never recruit any<me merely 
because he wants to join. Nor seek 
to persuade for the pleasure of hav- 
ing another share your views. He*H 
share them when the time comes 
... or youVe mii^udged flie mo- 
ment in history. Oh, there will be 
an educational organization but it 
must be separate; agitprop is no part 
of basic structure. 

“As to basic structure, a revolu- 
tion starts as a conspiracy; therefore 
structure is small, secret, and or- 
ganized as to minimize damage by 
betrayal — since there always are 
betrayals. One solution is the cell 
system and so far nothing better 
has been invented. 

“Much theorizing has gone into 
optimum cell size. I think that his- 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



55 




tory shows that a cell of three is 
best. More than three can’t agree 
on when to have dinner, much less 
when to strike. Manuel, you belong 
to a large family; do you vote on 
when to have dinner?” 

“Bog, no! Mum decides.” 

“Ah.” Prof took a pad from his 
pouch, began to sketch. “Here is a 
cells-of-three. If I were planning to 
take over Luna, I would start with 
us three. One would be opted as 
chairman. We wouldn’t vote; choice 
would be obvious — or we aren’t 
the right three. We would know the 
next nine people, three cells . but 
each cell would know only one of 
us,* 

“Looks like computer diagram — 
a ternary logic.” 

“Does it really? At the next level 
there are two ways of linking: This 
comrade, second level, knows his 
cell leader, his two cellmates, and 
on the third level he knows the 
#iree in his subcell. He may or may 
not know his cellmates’ subcells. One 
method doubles security, the other 
doubles speed of repair if security is 
penetrated. Let’s say he does not 
know his cellmates’ subcells — Man- 
uel, how many can he betray? Don’t 
say he won’t; today they can brain- 
wash any person, and starch and 
iron and use him. How many?” 
“Six,” I answered. “His boss, two 
cellmates, three in subcell.” 

“Seyen,” Prof corrected, “he be- 
toays himself, too. Which leaves 
•even broken links on three levels 
to repair. How?” 

”I don’t see how h can be,” ob- 
jected Wyoh. “You’ve got them so 
qdk it faHs to pieces.” 



“Manuel? An exercise for the 
student.” 

“Well . blokes down here have 
to have way to send message vip 
three levels. Don’t have to know 
who, just have to know where,** 1 
answered. 

“Precisely!” 

“But, Prof,” I went on, “there’s 
a better way to rig it.” 

“Really? Many revolutionary 
theorists have hammered this out, 
Manuel. I have such confidence in 
them that I’ll offer you a wager — 
at, say, ten to one.” 

“Ought to take your money. 
Take same cells, arrange in open 
pyramid of tetrahedrons. Whert 
vertices are in common, each bloke 
knows one in adjoining cell — 
knows how to send message to him, 
that’s all he needs. Communications 
never break down because they run 
sideways as well as up and down. 
Something like a neural net. It’s why 
you can knock a hole in a man’s 
head, take chunk of brain out, and 
not damage thinking much. Excess 
capacity, messages shunt around. He 
loses what was destroyed but goes 
on functioning.” 

“Manuel,” Prof said doubtfully, 
“could you draw a picture? It sounds 
good — but it’s so contrary to or- 
thodox doctrine that I need to sec 
it.” 

“Well . could do better with 
stereo drafting machine. But PIl 
try.” 

(Anybody who thinks it’s easy to 
sketch one hundred twenty-one te- 
trahedrons, a five-level open pyrar 
mid, clear enough to show relatioo- 
sh^ is invited to try!)

P iresently I said, at baas 

sket<^. Each vertex of Izt- 
angle shares sdif with zefo, one, or 
two other triangles. Where shares 
one« that’s ks link, one direcdoo or 
both. But one is enough for a tmM- 
pli-redundant communioatioQ net. 
On comers, where sharing is aero. It 
jum^ to ri^ to next comer. Whm 
sharing is double, choice is again 
right-handed. 

''Now work k with people. Talos

is comrade Dan. No, let’s go down 
one to show three levels of commusi- 
cation knocked out — levd &for-

anything — but has a way, {hone

"Now watch it work. Casimir,

Charlie and Cox in hb cell. Baker 
above him, and Donald, Dan, and 
Dick in subccU — whkii isolates 
Egbert, Edward, and Ekner, and 
everybody under them. 

“All three report it — redundancy,

No matter, Ezra rdays both messages

Bf bad luck Edmund is under Cox,

through Bnwri^t . and that gets

SECURITY 

by GERALD PEARCE 

SYNDROME 

He was the most loyal man 
on Earth — and in that lay 
the seeds of his treachery! 



N ov. 14, im 9:12 A. M. 

He got out of the cab, paid 
the driver, and stood staring up at 
the Society’s regional h.q. It’s cliff- 
like face loomed skyward. In his 
own mind it loomed even larger, 
more massively graceful, more sleek 
and subtly forbidding. 

There! he thought. Wasn’t that 
a disloyal thought? 

He bit his lip, adjusted the hang 
of his topcoat, and chose one of 
the dozen glass swing doors 

Outside, rain had threatened. In 
the vaulted lobby an alive silken 
texture to the air defied the ele- 
ments and proclaimed the superior 
efficiency of man. There was a sense 
of arriving — of suddenly finding 
oneself in the eye of a hurricane, 
while outside madness whirled about 
the calm of certainty. He saw a 



modest portrait of the Founder. A 
plaque reminded him that the so- 
ciety had been established “for the 
Preservation of National Ideals and 
the Rights of Citizens.” 

He started for the directory when 
a discreet sign caught his eye. ORIG- 
INATE SECURITY REPORTS AT 
INFORMATION DESK 4. 

He paused to straighten his coat 
before obeying. 

They kept him waiting two sec- 
onds, barely long enough to notice 
the beautiful enlargement of the 
Second Bill of Rights in its illumi- 
nated frame on the wall behind the 
desk. When the girl appeared before 
him he had the distinct sensation 
that she had materialized there be- 
tween one millionth of a second and 
the next. 

Her severely dressed black hair 



58 



was pulled back from a face of gray# 
beauty. He saw glowing ivory skin, 
arched eyebrows. Her high-necked 
dress surpassed the most rigid puri- 
tanical standards of concealment 
and yet, by some subtle stratagem 
oi line and texture, some comple- 
ment of color and bodily contour, 
conveyed a degree of sexuality more 
disturbing than commercial expos- 
ure. He managed a look of quick 
contempt and wondered, briefly for- 
getting his own concerns, how she 
kept her job. 

“May I help you?” 

“It’s a fitness matter. A Security 
matter.” 

“Do you wish to file an informer 
report?” 

“No! That is . yes.” 

“Your name, please.” 

“Brown. James Cranston Brown.” 

He added his address and Social 
Responsibility number. She typed 
quickly, eyes downcast. A teletype 
keyboard set into the desk below his 
angle of vision made soft, barely 
audible sounds. “And the name of 
the person you wish to report, Mr. 
Brown?” 

“Uh, yes,” he said. “It’s . 
Brown. James Cranston Brown. 
Myself.” 

For the tiniest fraction of a sec- 
ond her fingers hesitated over the 
keyboard. 

9:20 AM. 

Within five minutes Brown’s file 
was on Hagen’s desk on the forty- 
lecond floor. 

“You’re sure he’s not on the 
Psych List?” Hagen asked. 

“If he were his file would show 



it,” his secretary said. “It doesn’t, 
but I checked anyway.” 

“Okay,” Hagen said after a pause. 
“Fll buzz you when I’m ready for 
him.” 

She returned to the outer office. 
He picked up his phone and dialed 
an extension. 

“Dr. Stillman.” 

“Hi, Ted,” Hagen said’. “Fve 
someone I want you to look at. He 
just filed an informer report against 
himself.” 

“Against himself?** 

“That’s what I said.” 

“Fll be right over.” 

Hagen hung up, chewing thought- 
fully on a thumbnail. He would 
have to wait for Stillman before 
reaching for the buzzer that would 
send in the interviewee. 

His phone hummed. 

“Hagen.” 

“Hello, Hagen, this is Arnold,” 
the Regional Chairman boomed in 
his ear. “Hear you picked up a new 
wrinkle.” 

“This fellow Brown? Reporting 
himself?” 

“So it’s true, is it?” 

“It’s true, chief. He’s a professor 
of history at the University of Cali- 
fornia.” 

“Fll be damned. Of course, the 
colleges are still hotbeds of cryptop- 
inks, but . D’you suppose it could 
be part of a Conspiracy gambit to 
discredit the Society?” 

“It’s possible.” 

“Anyway, this is one I want to be 
kept posted on. Fair enough?” 
“Sure, chief.” 

Hagen replaced the phone. A tiny 
light glowed suddenly on the bank 



MCinUTY SYNDROME 




beside it, telling him that the psy- 
chiatrist was installed in the obser- 
vation room behind the one-way 
window. 

9:33 AM. 

‘This is Mr. Hagen, of our Execu- 
tive Branch,” the secretary said. 
“Mr. Brown.” 

From across the desk a square- 
shouldered man regarded him with 
quiet, probing eyes. Brown shudder- 
ed inwardly. They were the eyes of 
his own conscience. 

“Have a seat,” Hagen said. 

He obeyed, taking the lone chair 
that sat squarely in front of the 
desk. He crossed his knees, clasped 
his hands. He squeezed them. 

“I don’t suppose I have to remind 
you,” Hagen said almost absently, 
“that we have no connection wiA 
any level of government. We’re an 
independent patriotic service agency. 
It’s our job to investigate, advise and 
educate.” 

Brown nodded, waiting. 

And Hagen said, putting his el- 
bows on the desk and leaning for- 
ward comfortably, “Now what’s all 
this about, Mr. Brown?” 

Brown said simply, “I’m a loyal 
citizen.” 

Hagen studied him oddly for a 
long moment. 

“I should hope so.” He sat back. 
“Especially since you’re a professor 
of history. That’s a job we rate Sen- 
sitive-A, so of course we’ve investi- 
gated you. As we have quite a few 
other people. I have your file here.” 
He tapped the narrow microfilm 
container on his desk with a blunt 
fingertip. “We know more about you 



and your associations than a squad 
of detecdves could tell you in ten 
years.” 

Brown’s tongue flicked over 
lips. He nodded again. 

“Don’t you think,” Hagen asked 
mildly, “that we have enough infor- 
mation about you to decide for our- 
selves?” 

“I . Not necessarily. You cant 
tell,” Brown explained with a hint 
of desperation, “what’s going on in 
a man’s mind.” 

“What’s been going on in yours?” 
“Uh, nothing. But I know what I 
feel, and I don’t feel — well, loyal.” 
Hagen gave him another long 
look. “Let’s look at it this way,” he 
went on reasonably. “As a history 
professor, I don’t suppose you have 
any doubt that a conspiracy against 
our way of life does exist?” 

“Of course — ” he had to clear hit 
throat — “of course not.” 

“Nor that its agents have been in 
substantial control of our govern- 
ment for most of the Twentieth 
Century, and haven’t yet been en- 
tirely weeded out?” 

“No! No, of course not.” 
“What have you done to further 
this conspiracy?” 

For a sickening moment Brown 
was at a loss for words. “Why . 
nothing!” 

“Did you oppose adoption of the 
Second Bill of Rights?” 

His mouth still open. Brown could 
only shake his head. 

“Have you mental reservations 
about the Second Bill of Rights?” 
The head shake continued. 

“Don’t you approve of the So- 
ciety?” 



60 



IF 




Sweat had broken out of his face. 
Brown felt the beads rolling, tasted 
their salt. 

“Because after all,” Hagen said, 
“disapproval of the Society is no 
kss than disapproval of the national 
ideals it was set up to always pre- 
•crve.” 

Brown’s nervousness reached its 
crisis. 

For a shadow of eternity he could 
neither breathe nor think. Then 
there was a lurch and a sharp clap 
against his eardrums and his heart 
began a frantic clamoring rush to 
catch up with time and he almost 
shouted, “No, wait! I approve! I 
do! You don’t understand!” 

Now Hagen waited for him to 
collect himself. 

“Maybe I don’t, Mr. Brown.” He 
leaned back in his chair, smiled, 
crossed his legs, and pointed to the 
microfilm container. “But your last 
fitness evaluation gives you a dou- 
ble-A rating.” 

Struggling to control inward hor- 
ror, Brown fumbled for a handker- 
chief to mop his face and neck. 
Hagen went on pleasantly, “Say a 
student monitor in one of your 
classes reports you for historical de- 
viation. You’d be re-rated before 
you could blink. Meantime, though 
. even the Regional Chairman’s 
only a double-A.” 

Brown sighed raggedly and shov- 
ed the handkerchief back into his 
pocket. 

“It makes no difference.” He had 
control over his voice again. “I’m a 
teacher. In that capacity I have at 
least some responsibility for ray 
students’ civil liberties. Article Two 



of the Second Bill. ‘Every citizen, 
regardless of racial, religious, or 
economic background, is guaranteed 
freedom from seditious, false and 
heretical doctrines which, by their 
nature, interfere with the highest 
intellectual functions, and therefore 
are inimical to intellectual freedom.* 
Remember I teach a Sensitive sub- 
ject. And now ... I don’t know. 
About myself, I mean. God knows 
what I might try to put over. I 
can’t place it, I can’t pin it down, 
but I know I’m . guilty.” 

“Without having done anything?" 
Hagen said. 

12:35 PM. 

Wrily, Dr. Stillman scratched the 
bridge of his nose. The tests were 
done, the apparatus had been dis- 
connected, and he had sent the re- 
sults to Psych Stat for processing. 
Brown, in his shirt sleeves and with- 
out his tie, tried to relax in a deep 
leather chair. He lit a cigarette. 

“Now,” Stillman said, pushing an 
ashtray across the desk towards him, 
“what the devil made you report 
yourself?” 

Brown scraped a shred of tobacco 
from his lower lip. “Didn’t your 
tests tell you?” 

“The tests still have to be eval- 
uated.” Stillman smiled. He had a 
genuine, disarming smile. It revealed 
his basic good nature and concealed 
a gnawing doubt. “Suppose you tell 
me what sort of classified informa- 
tion you have access to.” 

Brown started, paled visibly, then 
drew hungrily on his cigarette. 

“Yes. That. Well, I have top clear- 
ance for my professional rank. I not

only teach, I serve in the prepara- 
tion of text books for advanced 
study. That means research m re- 
stricted source material. My head, 
consequently, contains a detailed 
catalogue of socio-historic error.** 
“But the work*s necessary, isn*t 
it?” 

“Oh, indeed yes. Most histories 
written prior to 1980 were rabid 
with unescoism.** 

“It sounds like a big responsibil- 
ity.” 

“Well, yes.” 

‘Trying to run away from it?” 
“Why should I? It’s my job. I 
enjoy it. And I’ve never shirked 
responsibility. Otherwise I wouldn’t 
be here.” 

“It’s not quite that simple, you 
know,” Stillman said without force. 
“You may be channeling some min- 
or neurosis into worry about your 
loyalty.** 

Brown shook his head. “No.” 
“Then why suddenly decide you 
were a risk?” 

“Not suddenly. Gradually.” 
“Either way.” 

“I found I had a guilty con- 
science.” 

“What about?” 

Stillman waited. Brown ground 
out his cigarette with sudden vio- 
lence. “You’re the expert on invol- 
untary guilt reactions, doctor.” 
Stillman said helpfully, “Blushing. 
Stammering. That kind of thing.” 
“That kind of thing. With some 
people it’s sex. With me it’s Secur- 
ity.” 

Stillman gave his wry, friendly 
smile. 

“Western Civilization instills a 



negative attitude toward sex, Mr. 
Brown. No one can escape his sex- 
uality, no matt^ how mudi lie 
might want to. Once our anti-sex 
standard is accepted, everyone has 
a basis for guilt — the sex drive 
itself. But we don’t have an innate 
physiological treason drive.” 

“Exactly!” Brown said. “So con- 
sider my situation. In a Sensitive 
job. Unable to hear the worxis spok- 
en — his voice became a rattle — ■ 
“Security, loyalty, fitness, risk. — 
He lit another cigarette. The 
smoke climbed raggedly. 

“How about that, doctor?” 

“A sign of disturbance, yes.” 

“I tried to explain it away. Noth- 
ing worked. Could I in fact be 
wrong about myself? Had I, without 
knowing it, been contaminated by 
the very intellectual errors I was 
supposed to be exposing? Was / t 
tool of the Conspiracy?” 

Stillman scratched the bridge of 
his nose. 

“But doesn’t the idea still suggest 
neurosis, Mr. Brown? I mean,” ho 
went on quickly to forestall an out- 
burst, “if you’ve really been . let’s 
say unconsciously seduced into error, 
a conflict exists in your unconscious 
and . .** 

“God damn it, doctor,” Brown in- 
terrupted, “I can’t take chances with 
a headful of dangerous thoughts that 
caused untold damage once and 
might do so again. There’s a risk in- 
volved.” 

“Perhaps,” Stillman agreed pla- 
catingly, “but don’t you think . .?” 
“Can you take chances? You, doc- 
tor? No, you can’t.” Brown slam- 
med the desk top between them. His

IF 




face glistened. He said passionately, 
“I had to report myself, don’t you 
see? 1 may never teach again but 1 
had to do it. Because I’m a loyal 
American.” 

Stillman’s phone hummed. He ex- 
cused himself. 

“Dr. Stillman.” 

“Hi, doc. This is Bauer at Psych 
Stat. We’ve got the Brown test re- 
sults. Want ’em right away?” 

“Please,” Stillman said. 

“Classic case,” Bauer said enthu- 
siastically. “Guilty as hell.” 

1:15 PM. 

Entering Stillman’s office, Hagen 
found the psychiatrist staring ab- 
stractedly out of the lone window. 

“Okay,” Hagen said. “What’s the 
trouble?” 

Stillman flipped open the Psych 
Stat folder that lay on his desk. 

“Look at this.” His face had lost 
its friendly look. “First the Standard 
Security Test — associative, projec- 
tive, the works, with polygraphic 
correlations. All the wrong answers. 
The responses have guilt in every 
line. Then I gave him the Enright 
General Adjustment Profile to get 
an over-all picture of the personality 
and make sure we didn’t have a 
simple crank on our hands. All the 
right answers. Sane as a summer 
day.” 

“There’s no chance he’s a Con- 
spiracy plant to discredit our proce- 
dure?” 

“No.” 

With a sigh of relief, Hagen drop- 
ped into the big leather chair Brown 
had sat in earlier. He could red- 
stamp Brown on the basis of the 



tests alone and no Committee of 
Review in the country would take 
five minutes to uphold his judgment. 

He settled himself comfortably. 
“Well, that’s fairly conclusive, Ted. 
I mean if the man’s normal, he isn’t 
attributing his guilt feeling to dis- 
loyalty to hide from their true ori- 
gin. Of course, it means that otir 
surveillance and monitoring systems 
have broken down, since We don’t 
have any derogatory information oa 
him, but . .” 

“No,” Stillman said. 

“What?” 

“The man isn’t normal.” 

“Isn’t . .? Now, wait a minute,” 
Hagen interrupted himself impa- 
tiently. “You can’t disregard the 
Enright on the basis of a hunch. It’s 
standardized and accepted.” 

“And it’s good and conclusive. 
But not this time. And maybe never 
again.” He took a chart from the 
folder. “Look at that tabulation. 
Well-balanced. Intelligent. Good se- 
mantic orientation. The only thing 
that keeps him from being a para- 
gon of Enright normalcy is a tinge 
of anxiety that falls within the sta- 
tistical norm anyway.” 

“Anxiety neurosis?” 

“Catchword,” Stillman snapped. 
“Anxiety about what? Money? Sex? 
Rejection? Any of the usual disturb- 
ances? No. That’s what the Enright’s 
for — to spot those quirks and point 
to their origin. In this case it points 
to nothing. In other words, it points 
to something the test wasn’t built to 
handle. Play back those tapes and 
it’ll stand out a mile.” 

“It will?” Hagen said cautiously. 
“The Standard Security Test re-

veals consciousness of guilt. Neither 
you nor Brown can find anything 
for him to feel guilty about. Still 
Brown won’t concede that his guilt 
feelings may be a symptom of neu- 
rosis. The best he can do, para- 
doxically, is trace them to a sup- 
posed — a supposed, mind you — 
unconscious sense of unreliability 
about a headful of dangerous ideas 
he’s carrying around with him. If 
he’s right, it means he has an un- 
conscious urge to use that knowledge 
wrongly, which is sick. If he’s wrong, 
then we still haven’t explained his 
guilt feelings, so he’s still sick.” 

“So?” 

“So his neurosis is Security. Not 
the way the psych books use the 
word. Capital S Security. And don’t 
look for symbolism. He’s a sick 
man.” 

Hagen’s first response was blank 
amazement. It died abruptly and a 
small cold knot of doubt replaced it. 

He paused to fish out a cigarette 
and light it, frowning. 

“You can’t throw out the Enright 
results just on a hunch.” 

“Enright never heard of a Security 
syndrome.” Stillman had dropped 
into the swivel chair behind his desk. 
His narrow face looked earnestly 
across its width. “Compare it with 
the traditional sense of sin, with the 
whole moral orientation based on a 
sense of personal evil and the need 
for redemption.” 

“You mean Brown has a neurotic 
conviction of sinfulness? Of having 
sinned against national security?” 

“Of innate sinfulness,” Stillman 
corrected, “divorced from objective 
fact.” 



Hagen allowed lii wofiy to Asm 
on his face. 

Maybe Stillman had been working 
too hard, he thought hopefully. Or 
was he jumping to conclusions, mis- 
understanding what Stillman was 
frying to tell him? 

“Suppose,” he said slowly, “sup- 
pose Brown’s historical researches 
actually did move him toward intel- 
lectual ^or in spite of himself. 
Mightn’t his unconscious give warn- 
ing by means of these guilt feelings? 
It seems to me that would mark 
him as a well-balanced and loyal 
individual, conscious of his weak- 
nesses and anxious to avoid doing 
harm through them.” 

“Except for one thing,” Stillman 
said. 

“Yes?” 

Tffis irrational behavior. His self- 
destructive behavior.” 

“Now wait a minute,” Hagen said 
again, sharply this time. 

“Clinically,” Hagen insisted, “we 
have to regard the act of filing an 
informer report against himself as 
a punitive, self-destructive act. He 
doesn’t simply want to remove him- 
sdf from a position where he might 
do harm, he wants to be punished 
for a harm he hasn’t committed. He 
knows he’ll never teach again if you 
red-stamp him.” 

“Clinically,” Hagen said, the word 
a meaningless metallic sound in his 
ears. 

He sighed, deeply, and studied the 
burning tip of his cigarette. 

“Be careful, Ted. Before you say 
anything else, stop and think the 
impIic:\tions through. From my 
viewpoint.”

“I have, rvc tried to explain.*’ 

“I know what you’ve tried to ex- 
fdain. But think, Ted. Does it mat- 
ter?” 

He looked up at Stillman now. 

**MatterT* Stillman said after a 
blank pause. “Of course it matters. 
First, there’s the question of aetiol- 
ogy. Are his guilty reactions really 
based on unconscious agreement with 
proscribed opinions? Or has the 
jM’essure of conformity produced a 
counter-urge to non-conformity? In 
cither case, the man is sick, and 
what he needs is help, not punish- 
ment.” 

“No one’s going to punish him.” 
Hagen said, loudly enough to cut 
Stillman off. “Only a court can do 
that. We’re not a court, we’re a 
service organization. All we do is 
advise. The point is that a man so 
unbalanced as to imagine himself 
treasonous is by that fact unbalanced 
enough to be irresponsible and dan- 
gerous.” 

“All right!” Stillman snapped. 
The point I’m trying to make . .” 

‘There isn’t any other point.” 

Stillman’s face was bleak and 
tense. A stranger’s face, rigid with 
antagonism. 

He had one chance to redeem 
himself. Instead he said, “Even if 
we’re responsible? Even if we’re 
doing it to them?” 

Suspicion metamorphosed into cer- 
tainty. 

Hagen felt as though a gulf had 
opened beneath him. 

. The entering wedge, he 
thought moments later as shdek and 
loss began to give way before the 
demands of discipline and convic- 



tion. Right out of every book and 
pamphlet the Founder ever wrote 
thirty, thirty-five years ago. A count- 
er-urge to non-conformity . What 
did that mean? A manifestation of 
unfitness that ought to be somehow 
ignored, forgiven? And how far 
could you take that kind of reason- 
ing? Soon you’d be trapped in an 
endless downward spiral of senti- 
mental soft-hearted nonsense in 
which no one could be held respon- 
sible for anything, and the Society 
might just as well never have been 
dreamed of. It was precisely this 
kind of thing that had once provid- 
ed a field day for the bleeding hearts 
and the do-gooders, blurring the 
moral fibre of the nation, softening 
it up for the Conspiracy. 

But it wouldn’t happen again. The 
country had the Society to protect 
it now. 

Hagen ground out his cigarette. 
“The Society wasn’t intended to be 
a free health clinic.” 

He got to his feet. There were 
things to do, ramifications he was 
only beginning to appreciate. 

Stillman sat stiffly behind the 
desk. His face was frozen and in- 
credibly accusing, which goaded 
Hagen to a spurt of anger. 

“No one’s going to let American 
security fall into the hands of a 
bunch of clinical psychiatric theor- 
ists.” 

Slowly, the psychiatrist raised a 
hand to his face, scratched the nar- 
row bridge of his nose. Equally 
slowly he lowered the hand to its 
former position. He waited. He 
might not have moved. 

Hagen turned abruptly and strode

jlo the door. As he was about to 
I open it Stillman said from his desk: 

I “Are we going to make neurosis 
i unconstitutional, like public hous- 
ing?” 

1:48 PM, 

Hagen gave Brown the good news, 
signed the slip and set the wheels 
in motion. Then he took the elevator 
to the forty-third floor. The Region- 
al Chairman was free and gave him 
a hearty welcome. His dark paneled 
office smelled of leather and good 
tobacco. 

“This man Brown,” Arnold said. 
“You had one of the Psych staff ex- 
amine him, I suppose?” 

“Of course, chief. The Standard 
Security Test was positive. The En- 
right showed a normal personality.” 

“And he actually reported him- 
self? Now that’s loyalty for you!” 
Arnold shook his head in baffled 
admiration. “It’s a gratifying index 
of our educational penetration, isn’t 
H?” 

“I think we’re doing the job as- 
signed us, chief. Perhaps even better 
than we’d hoped. According to Dr. 
Stillman, Brown turned himself in 
for seditious inclinations that exist- 
ed only in his unconscious mind.” 

Arnold was impressed. 

“This . this is difficult for me 
to say,” Hagen went on. “I’ve been 
a friend of Ted Stillman’s for a good 
many years. But, well, the Brown 
case upset him pretty badly. He 
seems to feel there’s something 
wrong about invading a man’s un- 
conscious and moving against dis- 
loyalty in that precinct.” 

Arnold stared. 



“Doesn’t he realize that disloyalty 
has to be rooted out wherever it s 
found?” 

Hagen didn't answer. 

Arnold was silent a long time. 

“You never know where it’s going 
to strike next,” he said, almost to 
himself. “It’s like a damned mutant 
virus. You haven’t reported this 
through channels, have you?” 

“Not yet. I thought you might 
want to give the matter especially 
discreet handling. I think we’re going 
to have to re-investigate medical 
ethics and the ideological implica- 
tions of psychiatric theory.” 

“Of course,” Arnold said. “Well, 
let’s get on with it.” 

1:50 PM. 

Brown left the Executive offices 
in a daze. Once in the corridor he 
leaned against the wall and closed 
his eyes, his one emotion heart- 
stopping relief. 

It was over. Over! He was free. 
The paper in his hand proved it.

the secret recesses of electronic in- 
telligence. There was a humming 
sound that was steady as the voice 
of God, an even glow, the unrelen:- 
ing rattle of teletype reception. 

A-D-V-I-S-O-R-Y. 

Red stamp. 

RISK. 

He flowed through the wires and 
the channels, the filaments and 
nerves and synapses of the Society’s 
great consciousness. Weariness, strain 
had drained from him. He felt sud- 
denly younger — younger than he 
had ever felt. A surging in his blood 
built to a heady euphoria. 

He was purged. 

He was clean. 

He moved away from the wall, 
walking slowly down the passage to 
the elevators. He rode down forty- 
two floors without knowledge of 
passing time. 

“Main floor.” 

He was in the vaulted lobby, my- 
sterious with its whisper of activity. 

Information desk #4 glided to- 
ward him. He reached out with arms 
spread in an attitude of possession, 
felt the cool texture of the desk 
beneath his palms. 

“May I help you?” 

Of course, he thought. That’s 
why I came back here. He looked at 
the smooth ivory skin, the deep im- 
personal eyes, the flagrant prim 
nudity of the girl in the high-necked 
dress. 

“I did it,” he said quietly. “I 
proved it. I’m a Security risL” 



There was an instantaneous flick- 
er of recognition in the deep eyes. 
A slight intake of breath. A barely 
detectable widening of the chiseled 
nostrils. 

“A loyal citizen.” 

He stood back, watching her. It 
was important that she understand. 
Intuitively he knew that she did. He 
thought, poor girl, why go through 
the agony of indirection? Go right 
up and tell them. They’ll believe 
you. And you can’t hide from your 
own conscience. 

“Good-by,” he said. 

He stood a moment longer, look- 
ing up and around to savor the tri- 
umph and certainty of his surround- 
ings. 

Now he was part of them, and 
would never be the same again. 

He pushed his way through one 
of the glass swing doors, stepped 
out onto the sidewalk. 

The rain was soft. An aerocab 
buzzed overhead. Taxis swerved and 
honked. Pedestrians waited under 
umbrellas at the intersection. People 
hurried along the sidewalks. 

If only they knew, he thought. If 
only they knew. 

Turning to look up at the sandy 
cliff-faced building, feeling the rain 
descending on his face like a bene- 
diction, Mr. Brown smiled. 

. While inside, her fingers light 
and fervent on the teletype keys, 
the girl in the high-necked dress 
took his unspoken advice and report- 
ed herself. END

IF • Short Story 



TOYS FOR DEBBIE 

by DAVID A. KYLE 



He was a friend of the famUy. 
Naturally he brought toys for 
the children — but what toys! 



T he locomotive, with flashing eye, 
roared out of the tunnel in the 
hill and rushed along the curving 
track. Halfway through the long 
bend, the speeding engine suddenly 
trembled and swayed. Then, within 
a few noisy seconds, most of the 
train separated from the rails, 
coaches ramming each other, sliding 
and slamming together over and 
around the engine. The locomotive 
died with a scream of steam, blot- 
ting out with its ferocious shhushh 
all the other screams . 

The child jumped up and down 
with sudden exhilaration and looked 
at the wreck. 

“Daddy, Daddy!” she said. “It’s 
crashed!” 

Her father, Frank Curtis, stopped 
talking with the insurance salesman 
and stepped back from the other 
end of the living room. 

The salesman, stiff and motion- 



less, watched the father put the toy 
cars back on die tracks. 

\ “If you’re going to wreck your 
toys, well, all right then, Debbie,” 
Frank Curtis said. “But can’t you 
remember we have a guest? Can’t 
you wait later to play rough?” He 
adjusted the silk ribbon in her hair. 

“Be a good girl for Daddy, dear.” 
The father straightened up and look- 
ed into the smooth, impassive face 
of the salesman. 

“Nothing broken, Mr. Black,** 
Frank Curtis said. 

“She’s an unusual child,” Mr. 
Black said. ‘T mean, girls don’t play 
with toy trains ordinarily.” 

“Well, she is unusual, Mr. Black,” 
the father said. “She likes all the 
stuff that girls play with, too.” 
“Was this hers, also, sir?” Mr. 
Black asked. He tipped his head 
toward the book shelf near where 
they stood. As Frank Curtis was 
nodding his head in reply, the sales- 



68 



man reached out and caressed the 
broken body of a model commercial 
airliner. 

“You saw the picture in the pap- 
er?” the father asked. 

“Oh, I did, yes.” The man quick- 
ly drew his hand away. “It was a 
tragic accident.” 

“Tragic?” Frank Curtis looked 
and sounded puzzled. “I think it 
can be mended. She broke it weeks 
after they took her picture with 
it . .” 

**That picture,” Mr. Black said 
sharply, his dark eyes dropping their 
gaze swiftly to the floor and then 
back to the six-year-old girl sitting 
on the sofa. She looked back at him 
serenely. “She’s an attractive child, 
takes a wonderful picture.” He was 
speaking rapidly. “Yes, I saw her 
picture — with that airplane, of 
course — in the local paper. It was 
a nice story, about a little girl who 
likes boys* toys as much as girls’. 
Yes, I read about her.” 

Frank Curtis hesitated a moment, 
then said, “Oh,” and smiled. 

Mr. Black continued. “Yes, I read 
about her. I read a lot, I keep up 
with things.” He stopped abruptly 
and then added: “You must be proud 
of your daughter, Mr. Curtis, very 
proud.” The father responded with 
a w^arm grin, a bit modest. 

“Yes, when I read that article, 
even though it was brief, I felt I 
knew Debbie. And I wanted to do 
something for her.” The salesman 
squeezed the other man’s shoulder. 
“I’m so anxious to make you one 
of our clients, Mr. Curtis, that I’m 
going to give you a deal you simj^ 
can’t afford to turn down.” 



I t was just such a deal and Frank 
Curtis did not turn it down. That 
was why Mr. Black returned the 
following month on the first regular 
collection call. With him he brought 
a doll for the little girl. She was 
really appreciative, even if her 
father did have to remind her to 
thank the nice man, and she took 
it up on the couch with, her to play. 

“They tell me you’re a new man,” 
Frank Curtis said, “but a good 
one.” 

Mr. Black raised his heavy black 
eyebrows in honest surprise. “Oh, 
you checked up on me? That was 
the right thing to do.” He paused 
for a moment, as if making a deci- 
sion, then added, “I’m a veteran. 
I had many years service — demo- 
litionist.” TTie smile stayed warm 
and frank. “I find my new work 
even more exciting — and more sat- 
isfying, of course, because of its 
humanitarianism.” 

Mr. Black picked up his red-and- 
black plaid cap and as he was leav- 
ing, said to Debbie, *Tt’s a very 
special doll, you know, honey.” He 
hesitated before adding, casually, “I 
mean, it’s practically unbreakable.” 
Debbie’s father looked startled, his 
mouth opening and closing silently. 

On the following monthly visit 
when Mr. Black came, he said to 
her, while her father was getting his 
check book, “I’m sorry your dolly 
lost its arm.” 

She crawled under the sofa and 
brought out the doll; it was in a 
sorry state, dirty and ragged, nearly 
bald, its left arm gone, exposing the 
hollow shoulder socket. 

“Thank you, I’m sure,” the little 

69 



TOYS FOR DEBBIE 




girl said, looking up with wide soft 
eyes. “How did you know?” Mr. 
Black avoided her stare and then 
Mr. Curtis came in and saw the 
doll. 

“It’s a shame,” Frank Curtis said. 
“I’d hoped we’d keep it a secret 
from you.” He shrugged his shoul- 
ders. “Well, it shouldn’t be any 
surprise.” 

“It’s quite all right, sir. It was only 
a cheap doll and it’s served its pur- 
pose.” 

“You know,” the father said slow- 
ly, “those grown-up dolls — I can’t 
get used to them. The obvious ma- 
turity . .” He picked up the toy 
and examined it carefully. “Why,” 
he said, genuinely surprised, “I think 
it has real hair!” He put the doll 
on the bookcase shelf. “I hope my 
daughter isn’t just plain vicious.” 

“Oh, no! She’s just completely 
human, I assure you.” Mr. Black 
sighed. “She’s mischievous, but real- 
ly quite innocent.” 

F or the first time Frank Curtis 
seemed to sense something be- 
hind Mr. Black’s speech. “You seem 
to know more about my child than 
I do.” 

Mr. Black’s stare was fixed on the 
floor. “I generalize, of course. All 
children have two natures — one is 
primeval,, selfish and savage, the 
other is moral, unselfish and civil- 
ized Children who are still innocent 
express themselves either way — 
sometimes both ways simultaneous- 
ly.” He lifted his head and looked 
Frank Curtis deep in the eyes. The 
gaze, unlike the charged and force- 
ful speech, was cool and calm. 



“Forget about the doll,” Mr. 
Black said. He put his right hand 
in his pocket and pulled out a small 
package. “Here’s something for her 
train. I made them for a nephew 
years ago, but unfortunately he died 
and I saved them to give to someone 
else some day.” 

He began to unwrap the pack- 
age. 

“Really, Mr. Black, you’re more 
than kind, but all this, gift-giving . .” 

“This is nothing, believe me. It’s 
more a personal thing than a pres- 
ent.” He opened the package. In- 
side were a number of narrow strips 
of paper. 

Frank Curtis examined them. They 
were all gummed on one side and 
had the names of some famous 
railroads printed on them. A few 
of them read: 20TH CENTURY 
LIMITED. 

In answer to the bewildered look, 
the salesman said: “It’s very simple, 
sir. I thought my nephew’s trains 
would look more real with these 
glued over the brand name. I thought 
you might let me fasten them on 
Debbie’s trains ...” 

For one of those rare times, the 
two men looked each other squarely 
in the face. Frank Curtis chewed 
on the inside of his cheek for sev- 
eral moments. 

“Why should I?” 

Mr. Black said wistfully, but per- 
suasively, “I loved my nephew very 
much — it’s something I wanted to 
do for him.” He made a little, pen- 
sive “hmmph” in his throat. “Chil- 
dren like to associate toys with real 
things. That’s all.” 

Debbie’s father shook his head, 

IP 



70 




frowning. “It sounds foolish. Why 
should a grown man like you think 
of such a thing?” 

“What would you have me think 
of? A new style doll, its pleasure 
measured by its expensiveness? A 
costly garment, to be outgrown 
quickly with fashionable waste? A 
pretty picture book, beautifully, 
scientifically and heartlessly manu- 
factured?” Mr. Black said this utterly 
without a trace of bitterness and the 
smile on his face was overwhelming- 
ly disarming. “The small things of- 
ten become the important things, 
the cherished things . And I 
loved my nephew!” 

Frank Curtis said, “You’re a real 
salesman!” There was a touch of 
awe in his admiration. 

So Mr. Black, with Mr. Curtis* 
help, changed the name of the train. 

Afterwards they decided to run 
the train a few times, just to see 
how it looked. 

I t went around the track several 
times without incident and then 
Mr. Black bent down and said softly 
to Debbie: “Can you make it run 
faster?” 

The locomotive, with flashing eye, 
roared out of the tunnel . 

Mr. Black towered above the lay- 
out, his feet planted on either side 
of the cardboard tunnel. 

. and rushed along the curving 
track . 

The father started to say, “It’s 
going too fast . .” 

The speeding engine trembled . 
swayed . 

Mr. Black’s face was expression- 



less and colorless and he picked up 
his plaid cap in preparation for 
leaving. 

. The train separated from 
the rails . 

“Ooops, off the track,” Mr. Black 
said in a small voice, strolling to- 
ward the door. “Thank you for 
everything . 

The locomotive died with a 
scream of steam, blotting out with its 
ferocious shhushh all other screams. 

The following month both the 
incident and the real tragedy were 
barely mentioned. “A terrible coin- 
cidence,” said Frank Curtis to his 
caller, which is precisely what he 
had said to himself when he had 
picked up the next day’s news- 
paper and saw the headline. Now no 
reminder remained, for the paper 
names on the train had soon dried 
up and peeled away. 

Mr. Black had another present for 
Debbie, but her father, more out of 
a reflex of custom, rather than a 
subconscious nervousness, was un- 
willing to accept it. Mr. Black was 
magnificently persuasive. He finally 
got an agreement after he said that 
he was going away and promised 
that this present would be the ab- 
solute end. 

Mr. Curtis opened the box and 
looked inside. What was it Mr. 
Black had said, Debbie was just 
mischievous, just human? 

The gift was an exquisite glass 
globe reproduction of the Earth. 

It looked quite fragile, so Frank 
Curtis put it on the shelf for when 
Debbie would be older and could 
cherish it. END

ST. GEORGE 

AND THE 

DRAGON MOTIVE 

by ROBERT F. YOUNG 

Illustrated by MORROW 



There's nothing strange about 
a railroad — unless, like this 
one, it's in the wrong century! 



I 

T he human race being what it 
is, men on the verge of making 
major discoveries are often preoc- 
cupied with the most minor of mat- 
ters. Take Lieutenant George St. 
George of the International Past- 
police, for example, when he rode 
into the valley of Lianour on that 



sixth-century morning in May. Mere 
moments after the Anachronism De- 
partment timeship had deposited him 
on the valley’s eastern slope he had 
developed an irksome itch just be- 
neath his right shoulder blade, and 
so absorbed was he in trying to 
relieve it he hardly knew where he 
was at. 

It was as hot as Hades inside his 



72 



iron suit, even with the visor op^ 
and to add to his woes the valley 
was abuzz with bees, any one of 
which might momentarily mistake 
his helmet for a hive. Aside from 
this, there was much to be said in 
the valley’s favor. It was broad and 
green, and patterned with stands of 
oaks and beeches. The wild-flower 
footprints of spring were scattered 
everywhere — over meadows, along 
fields, through woods. It was the 
sort of setting that idylls are born 
of, although you couldn’t prove it 
by St. George. 

He was trying for the tenth time 
to rub his back against the back- 
wall of his hauberk when three 
knights rode out of a nearby stand 
of oaks and came charging toward 
him like a trio of hammered-down 
locomotives. “Brace yourself, Hero- 
dotus,” he said to his rohorse. “We 
may have to joust.” 

H is rohorse didn’t say anything. 

Rohorses were made to be seen 
and not heard. They were also made 
to do aU sorts of other things — 
things real horses couldn’t even be- 
gin to do. So St. George wasn’t 
worried. 

He needn’t have been in any 
case. None of the three approaching 
knights had his spear dressed or his 
visor closed, and as they neared him 
they reined their mounts and cover- 
ed the remaining distance at a much 
more modest pace. The one in the 
lead, except for his helmet — which, 
like those of his two companions 
and that of St. George, looked like 
the upper section of a 30-gallon 
hot water tank — was clad complete- 

ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGONMOTIVE 



ly in chain mail. His trousers and 
shirt were made of the stuff, and 
hanging from his shoulders all the 
way to his ankles was a magnificent 
chain-mail ulster. The effect was 
dazzling. The other two knights, like 
St. George, were outfitted in much 
more orthodox armor — breast- 
plates, pauldrons, gorgets, greaves, 
cuisses and sollerets — although in 
St. George’s case the material was 
of twenty-first century vintage. 

“I hight Sir Ulfin du Bois,” Chain 
Mail said, as the trio clanked to a 
halt directly in St. George’s path. 
“My place is nigh the Siege Perilous 
at the Round Table of King Ar- 
thur.” He indicated first the knight 
on his left and then the one on his 
right. “They hight Sir Guy de 
Gloomis and Sir Bagdemagus le 
Savage, the which also abideth in 
the next vale. We seeketh the drag- 
on of Lianour, in order that we may 
slay it and bring its depredations to 
an end.” 

“I hight Sir George le Vainquer,** 
said St. George, who had boned up 
on medieval English before depart- 
ing for the past, as he brought 
Herodotus to a halt. **I hail from 
Nottis, the which is far to the north, 
and journey through this country to 
the sea, whereon I would make voy- 
age. 

Except for his armor, Sir Ulfin 
didn’t look particularly formidable. 
Little could be seen of his face 
through his open visor, but what 
could be seen revealed him to be a 
well-fed man in his early forties with 
mild blue eyes and a wispy blond 
moustache. 

What little could be seen of the 

73 




other two knights’ faces revealed 
Sir Guy and Sir Bagdemagus to be 
a couple of overgrown kids. “Would 
ye joust with us or would ye ac- 
company us and partake of our ad- 
venture?” the latter asked. 

As a sporting proposition, the of- 
fer left much to be desired. How- 
ever, it in no way interfered with 
“Sir” George’s plans. The anach- 
ronism he’d come back in time to 
correct existed somewhere within a 
thirty-mile radius of the spot where 
the timeship had deposited him, so 
it made no difference which direc- 
tion he traveled in provided he didn’t 
exceed the radius. So why not ac- 
company the three knights? Two of 
them — Sir Guy and Sir Bagdema- 
gus — lived in the next valley and 
might very well be on speaking terms 
with the mistake in the chronologi- 
cal order of things he’d come back 
to set aright. 

So he said, “Sithen ye have need 
of my spear, I will accompany ye.” 

A s the quartet rode over the idyllic 
meadows and through the idyl- 
lic woods, it came gradually to light 
via small talk that Sir Ulfin du Bois 
had set out in quest of the Holy 
Grail some time ago and had only 
recently arrived in this part of 
“Logris”. Yesterday he had met Sirs 
Guy and' Bagdemagus and so great 
had been their admiration for his 
armor (they said) he’d promised to 
get them suits just like it — as he’d 
already done for a number of other 
knights of Gloomis — from the very 
armor-maker who had created his 
own ensemble, and for a most mod- 
est price. He’d also agreed to help 



them slay the dragon of Lianour. 
The inhabitants of Lianour consisted 
of freemen turned farmer, shopkeep- 
er, sheepherder and smithy. And free- 
men turned farmer, shopkeeper, 
sheepherder and smithy — it went 
without saying — didn’t know beans 
about dragons and wouldn’t have 
known how to go about slaying one 
if they had. Hence, outside assist- 
ance was urgently needed. 

The dragon in question had put 
in its appearance less than a week 
ago, and “sithen”, it had been mak- 
ing daily excursions over the Lian- 
our landscape, terrorizing sheep, 
cows, damsels and little children. It 
was an unusually large and ferocious 
member of the species, which ex- 
plained why Sirs Guy and Bagde- 
magiis had considered it the better 
part of valor not to attempt the 
slaying act by themselves. The drag- 
on was unusual in other respects, 
too. In its belly it carried a damsel 
whom it had devoured some time 
ago but who — miraculously — was 
still “on live”, plus a large number 
of farmers, shopkeepers, sheepherd- 
ers and smithies, whom it had also 
devoured some time ago and who 
— also miraculously — were still “on 
live”. In addition to these unique 
features, it had an uncommonly 
tough skin, even for a dragon, and 
no longer than day before yesterday 
Sir Bagdemagus le Savage, in ven- 
turing in close and smiting it on the 
flank, had put a big dent in his 
second-best sword. 

To all of this, Lt. George St. 
George listened with a somewhat cyn- 
ical ear. He’d heard talk of dragons 
in many a time period, but he had 



74 



IP 




never seen one and never expected 
to. Moreover, there was no doubt 
in his mind but what Sir Guy’s and 
Bagdemagus’ version would turn out 
to be a deer or a boar or some sim- 
ilar unoffending and helpless animal, 
which the three dauntless knights 
would skewer on their spears and 
chop to pieces with their swords and 
then hie themselves either to Sir 
Guy’s or Sir Bagdemagus’ hearthside 
and extol their prowess over count- 
less cups of mead. Or perhaps it 
would turn out to be nothing but 
thin air — an eventuality that would 
neither stop Sir Ulfin du Bois from 
seeing it or from bragging about the 
deed afterward. When a knight made 
up his mind he was going to help 
slay a dragon, no power on earth 
could stop him. 

St. George’s cynicism didn’t in 
the least abate when Sir Bagdema- 
gus, who had ridden on ahead, call- 
ed back that he’d spotted the dra- 
gon’s footprints. Certainly, our hero 
reflected, anyone who could see a 
dragon oughtn’t to have any trouble 
seeing its footprints. But as matters 
turned out, St. George was able to 
see the footprints too. As a matter 
of fact, they were as plain as day. 
Only in his vocabulary there was a 
different term for them. Namely, 
“narrow-gauge railroad tracks”. They 
came over a distant rise, just as 
pretty as you pleased, and disap- 
peared into a distant woods, and 
they had been painstakingly pound- 
ed out of wrought iron. 

Shades of Casey Jones! No won- 
der the anachronism detector had 
thrown an electronic fit when Bates 
of Temporal Computations had ac- 

ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGONMOTIVE 



cidentally tuned in southwestern En- 
gland, circa 530 A.D. — a place- 
time where/when no anachronisms 
were supposed to exist I 

U 

A fter the discovery of the “foot- 
prints”, St. George expected the 
“dragon” itself to be- something of 
an anticlimax. But such did not 
prove to be the case. 

He heard the whistle first. Tweet- 
tweet! It went. Tweet-tweet-tweet! 

So help him, it did. 

Next, he saw the smoke. It was 
unquestionably wood smoke, it was 
shot liberally with sparks, and it 
trailed up into the blue sixth-century 
sky as though smoke coming out of 
a locomotive smokestack was as 
common a phenomenon in the days 
of King Arthur as it was — would 
be — in the days of King George V. 

Next, he heard the engine. Chug- 
a-lug, chug-a-lug, k went. Chug-a- 
lug, chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug! 

Finally he saw the locomotive it- 
self. And he’d be damned if, in 
conjunction with its wood-car and 
its two coaches, it didn*t look like a 
dragon! Enough like one, in any case, 
to satisfy a sixth-century knight. 

Compared to the hyper-Diesels of 
St. George’s day and age it was of 
course little more than a child’s toy. 
In both design and principles it was 
much like the Stourbridge Lion of 
1829, which made it about as tech- 
nically advanced a job as a pastime 
operator working with existent ma- 
terials and employing local labor 
would have been able to come up 
with. What lent maximum strength 

75 





to the dragon illusion were the two 
outside connecting rods that pro- 
pelled the driving wheels. They look- 
ed for all the world like a pair of 
ungainly legs, and pumping furiously 
up and down as they were, they 
gave the impression that the “drag- 
on” was running — or charging, if 
you preferred. 

In addition to the driving wheels, 
there were the two wheels they were 
coupled to. This gave the “dragon” 
four front “feet”. Tbe intermediate 
and the rear “feet” were provided 
by the wood-car and the two 
coaches. The wood-car looked like 
a stream-lined Roman chariot and 
the two coaches brought to mind a 
pair of Toonerville Trolleys. 

An outside flue curled up over the 
face-plate of the boiler connecting 
the firebox to the base of the five- 

76 - 



foot high smokestack. Even St. 
George had no trouble identifying 
it as a “nose”. The “eyes” were 
two big bolts to which two support- 
ing rods were attached. There was 
no mouth, but it was no trick at all 
to imagine the face-plate lifting up 
to engorge intended victims. 

The boiler consisted of three 
wrought-iron sections overlapping 
each other and CTudely welded to- 
gether. The engine’s cab, of course, 
constituted the forward section of 
the “belly”. In it, just as Sirs Guy 
and Bagdemagus had said, was a 
damsel, “the which was still on 
live”. And the coaches, of course, 
constituted the rear section of the 
belly. In them sat a number of 
farmers, shopkeepers, sheepherders 
and smithies, “the which were also 
still on live.” 

IP 





As for the damsel, not only was 
she still “on live”, she was running 
the “dragonmotive”. 

S t. George perceived these things 
catch-as-catch-can, for no soon- 
er did the little train come into sight 
than he charged it together with his 
three companions. Jousting with a 
dragonmotive was anything but his 
idea of a good time, but he knew 
that if he didn’t pull his own weight, 
so to speak, he’d lose face in the 
eyes of Sirs Ulfin, Guy and Bag- 
demagus, and that would never do. 
So, spear dressed and visor closed, 
he bore down on the approaching 
“monster” as furiously as they did, 
and when he reached it he veered 
in sharply and dealt it a glancing 
blow with his spear. Then he guided 
his rohorse alongside and began 



beating the boiler plating with his 
sword — not hard enough to do any 
damage but hard enough to make 
a lot of noise. 

Sirs Guy and Bagdemagus, believ- 
ing the encounter to be on the level, 
charged in at right angles and struck 
the dragonmotive’s “flank” with the 
impetus of two battering rams. But 
the wrought-iron plating had about 
as much resilience as a stone wall, 
and both were catapaulted over their 
horses’ croups at the moment of 
impact. Poor Sir Guy landed with 
a loud clank! and poor Sir Bagde- 
magus with an even louder clunk! 

Sir Ulfin du Bois was more for- 
tunate. He, too, pounded in at right 
angles, but his spear broke when it 
struck home, enabling him to remain 
seated. He joined St. George and 
helped him beat the boiler plating. 



ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGONMOTIVE

While they were thus engaged, St. 
George glanced up through the slits 
in his visor at the engineeress. Casey 
Jones, he thought. No, not Casey — 
Casianna, 

She had dark-brown hair and the 
wind was blowing it and her eyes 
were like the sky over Camelot and 
there was a beauty mark on her 
right cheek about one inch from the 
corner of her mouth. The look she 
gave him back put him on a par 
with a dog chasing a mail truck. 

Whoever was feeding the firebox 
was beyond his line of vision. Was 
it her husband? he wondered. And 
which twenty-first century country 
did she hail from? Judging from her 
features, she was a member of one 
of the Nordic races, but of course 
she could have had theiti altered. 

T he height of the roadbed put the 
cab beyond his reach, which 
perhaps was a good thing. Otherwise, 
in his eagerness to board the train, 
he might have tried to do it the hard 
way and have broken his neck. Ar- 
mor, even the lightweight variety 
that encased him, wasn’t conducive 
to acrobatics. 

What bugged him most was why 
a pastimer in his or her right mind 
would want to start up a railroad m 
ancient England. Granted, the local 
freemen had apparently conquered 
their fear of the little train, even if 
the local aristocracy hadn’t; but how 
much profit could possibly accrue 
from transporting handfuls of farm- 
ers, shopkeepers, sheepherders and 
smithies, all of whom were probably 
as poor as churchmice, from point 
A to point B? 



He could understand why a male 
pastimer would go back to the past 
and peddle plastic jewel cases to 
rich-bitches like Nefertite, Cleopatra 
and Zenobia for fantastic sums of 
gold (Anachronism Department Case 
No. 161-B; Correcting Detective: 
Lt. Geo. St. George; CLOSED), 
and he could see why a female pas- 
timer would go back to the past and 
sell oral contraceptives on the streets 
of ancient Babylon (Anachronism 
Department Case No. -244-R; Cor- 
recting Detective: Lt. Geo. St 

George; CLOSED) ; but a railroad in 
the days of King Arthur? 

Preposterous! 

Preposterous or not, he had one 
on his hands. 

m 

T he speed of the little train was 
some 20 mph — a modest 
enough velocity and one which a 
horse, under ordinary circumstances, 
would have no trouble maintaining. 
But consider a horse weighed down 
with armor plating and an armor- 
plated knight. Such a horse is not 
going to run 20 mph very long. 

St. George’s rohorse, of course, 
was made of sterner stuff, and 
could have maintained the pace all 
day long; but Sir Ulfin’s steed, while 
ostensibly no different in makeup, 
was already losing ground. So St. 
George encephalopathed Herodotus 
to keep pace with its less fortunate 
brother, simultaneously allaying 
whatever potential suspicions Casi- 
anna Jones might be entertaining 
and paving the way to an opportun- 
ity to board the train.

Sir Ulfin raised his visor. “Wit 
ye well, Sir George,” he shouted 
above the jingling of his chain mail, 
the clanking of our hero’s armor, 
and the chug-a-lug-lugging of the 
dragonmotive, “this be a parlous 
fiend the which cannot be fordone 
unholpen! I will depart me from 
hence with Sir Guy and Sir Bag- 
demagus and we will gather many 
brave and noble knights to partake 
of this adventure!” 

St. George raised his visor. “Haste 
ye then, Sir Ulfin,” he shouted, “and 
I shall abide thy again-coming!” 

They were abreast of the rear 
coach by this time. St. George drop- 
ped his sword belt and threw away 
his spear and his shield and guided 
Herodotus in closer. A little wooden 
ladder led to the roof, and after 
psyche-programming the rohorse to 
follow the train at a discreet dis- 
tance until otherwise “advised”, he 
grasped the middle rungs of the 
ladder and lifted himself from the 
saddle. Startled freemen regarded 
his exploit through the paneless 
windows, stared as he climbed the 
rungs to the roof. Once there, he 
rolled over on his back and sat up. 
Sir Ulfin and Herodotus were drop- 
ping rapidly behind. “Wit ye well,” 
shouted' the former, “that anon I 
returneth to Camelot the noble 
knights of the Round Table shall 
wot of this great deed thou hast 
accomplished, and wit ye well 
that . .” 

His voice was drowned out by the 
chug-a-lug-lugging of the dragon- 
motive. St. George waved good-by, 
and began taking his armor off. 

He removed his helmet first and 



threw it into a blackberry thicket. 
Next came his gorget and his hau- 
berk. These he tossed into a little 
stream that the coach was passing 
at the moment. Before proceeding 
further, he scratched his back. He 
gave a long and luxurious sigh. 

He slipped out of his cuisses and 
his greaves and heaved them into a 
meadow. Finally he- kicked off his 
sollerets. They clattered off the 
coach roof, tumbled to the tracks, 
and disappeared from sight. He lay 
on his back and breathed deeplv of 
the warm-cool wind. No more iron 
suits for him! 

Having had the foresight to wear 
the garb of a freeman beneath his 
armor, he was now one with the 
passengers of the train. He’d even 
let his hair grow long, so there was 
no problem there. He sat up and let 
it blow in the wind. Only court fools 
wore their hair short in this day 
and age. 

There was, of course, the prob- 
lem of shoes. But he’d worn heavy 
socks beneath his sollerets, and they 
would do till better footwear came 
along. 

Getting to his feet and adjusting 
himself to the lurching of the coach, 
he began making his way forward. It 
was weird in a way. Here was he, 
an inhabitant of the twenty-first 
century, walking the cars of a sixth- 
century train like a twentieth-cen- 
tury bindlestiff. -But no weirder, he 
supposed, than some of his other 
pastime experiences. Take the time 
during the first Memphite dynasty, 
for example, when he’d visited all 
the Memphis granaries and collected 
the myriad mousetraps an unscru- 



ST, GEORGE AND THE DRAGONMOTIVE

pulous pastimer had sold to the 
Pharaoh’s grain-master (Anachron- 
ism Department Case No. 602-C; 
Correcting Detective: Lt. Geo. St. 
George; CLOSED), or the time he’d 
crept into the premises of No. 1 
Inner Temple Lane in the dead of 
night and confiscated the battery- 
powered tape-recorder another un- 
scrupulous pastimer had sold to Dr. 
Samuel Johnson (Anachronism De- 
partment Case No. 347 -N; Correct- 
ing Detective: Lt. Geo. St. George; 
CLOSED), or the time he’d disman- 
tled the Gatling gun still another 
unscrupulous pastimer had sold to 
Datis and Artaphernes, the joint 
commanders of the Persian Expedi- 
tionary Force, just before the Battle 
of Marathon. \^en you came right 
down to it, all anachronisms brought 
about by pastimers in their constant 
effort to exploit the past were weird, 
and invariably when you involved 
yourself in them in order to correct 
them they became weirder yet. 

There were some schools of 
thought that said they shouldn’t be 
corrected. Anachronisms — both ar- 
tificial and natural — such schools 
maintained, were a part of the nor- 
mal order of things, and were their 
presence to influence the present 
status quo (which was highly un- 
likely), the resultant change was 
bound to be for the better. But the 
International Temporal Council was 
inclined to regard a bird in the hand 
as being worth two in a bush, and 
while its members readily admitted 
that things could be far better, they 
had the good sense to realize that 
things could be far worse, and were 
practical enough to take the neces- 



sary steps to keep them the way 
they were. 

H e had reached the wood-car by 
this time, and could see down 
into the cab. Casianna Jones was 
still at the throttle and her dark- 
brown hair was still blowing in the 
wind. The firebox was open and an 
old man was carrying wood from 
the wood pile to the aperture and 
replenishing the flames. He looked 
as though he was on his last legs, 
and his legs looked as though they 
were on their last mile. 

St. George couldn’t believe his 
eyes. Old men didn’t go in for 
pastiming — at least not on an active 
basis. At best, looting the past was 
a perilous profession, and nine times 
out of ten in the twenty-first century 
when a man passed the seventy 
mark he was content to retire to the 
viewing room and live the rest of 
his life vicariously via 3V. He 
wouldn’t dream of firing a boiler. 
Indeed, chances were he wouldn’t 
even know what a boiler was. 

Well this old man knew. And 
moreover he was firing one. 

St. George thought he had the 
answer. You didn’t build a railroad 
overnight, even under ideal cir- 
cumstances. Building one in the sixth 
century, even a small job such as 
this one, would take years. Probably 
the old man had begun the project 
ten or twelve years ago when he was 
relatively young. As for Casianna 
Jones, she was probably his daugh- 
ter, whom he had brought along for 
company and eventually turned into 
an engineer. 

St. George debated on whether to 

IP 



80 




arrest both of them on the spot, es- 
cort them to the timeship zone and 
put in a call via time-wave radio for 
transportation back to the present. 
He decided against it. There might 
be others in on the deal, and be- 
sides, he had to put the dragon- 
motive out of commission before 
leaving the scene just in case the 
“natives” might try to run it them- 
selves. For that matter, there might 
be other dragonmotives in operation, 
and these would have to be taken 
care of too. 

So he donned his best boy-scout 
smile and climbed down into the 
wood-car to help the old man. 

The old man stared at him. St. 
George returned the gaze. The old 
man had rheumy eyes, a long nose, 
a straggly goatee and matted gray 
hair. His cheeks were pink with 
networks of capillaries and he smell- 
ed like the bottom of a mead barrel. 

St. George picked up an armful 
of wood, carried it into the cab and 
threw it into the firebox. This time, 
it was Casianna Jones’s turn to stare 
at him. She did so. However, if she 
recognized him as one of the knights 
who a few moments ago had been 
harassing the engine she gave no 
sign. “Prithee, kind sir,” she said, 
“say me how thou earnest aboard 
the oxenless oxcart and what thy 
name is.” 

The language of the lower classes 
(which she undoubtedly was aping) 
left much to be desired, but at least 
it was somewhat less stilted than 
that of the aristocracy. He replied 
in kind: “I hight George, the which 
came on board but a short while 
ago. What are ye hight, damsel?” 



“I hight Rebecca L’Ouvertures.” 

A t this juncture, the old man came 
into the cab, flavoring the hot 
and acrid air with the odor of stale 
mead, and joined the conversation. 
“I hight Lionel the armor maker,” 
he announced, “the which is uncle 
to the damsel beside ye.” He peered 
into St. George’s eyes. “Are ye not 
afraid of the oxenlfess oxcart?” 

He was playing his role as flaw- 
lessly as his niece was playing hers 
— if she was his niece. But pastim- 
ers were almost always excellent 
actors. They had to be. St. George, 
as we have already seen, was no 
slouch himself. “Yea, I am much 
afraid of it, old man,” said he, “but 
my good sense tells me that which 
is made of iron cannot be on live 
and that therefore there can be 
naught to be afraid of.” 

“Are ye of Lianour?” 

Our hero shook his head. “I 
journeyed south from Camelot, 
whence I was driven by a surly 
landowner the which desired the 
wretched strip of land bestowed up- 
on me by his father. I have neither 
herborow nor the wherewithal with 
which to obtain it. So destitute am I 
of worldly goods that I was forced 
to board the oxenless oxcart secretly 
and without your leave. By your 
leave, I will pay you in the only 
way I am able — by feeding the fire.” 
“Ye wish lodging?” This time, it 
was Casianna Jones who spoke. 

“By my troth, fair damsel.” 
“Then ye shall have it,” said 
Lionel the armor-maker, “ — an ye 
ride each day on the oxenless oxcart 
and feed the fire.” 



ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGONMOTIVE 



81 




“Yea,” said Casianna Jones. “Ye 
shall live with us and share our 
meager fare and free mine uncle for 
tasks more becoming to one of his 
calling.” 

Nothing was said about wages, 
but that was all right. St. George 
had obtained what he’d set out to 
obtain — an opportunity to investi- 
gate the pastime operation more 
fully — and had procured a position 
that would enable him to put the 
dragonmotive out of commission 
virtually any time he chose to do 
so. Besides, in this day and age the 
term “wages” — at least insofar as it 
would some day be understood — 
didn’t even exist. 

The train was approaching a 
handful of hovels, shops and pig- 
sties. Uncle Lionel got a sheepskin 
bag out of a box in the corner of 
the cab and prepared to step down 
from the dragonmotive to greet a 
pair of trembling passengers who 
were waiting by the roadbed. Casi- 
anna Jones blew the whistle. Tweet! 
Tweet! She pulled back on the throt- 
tle. Chug-a-lug, went the dragon- 
motive. Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug, chug 
... a lug .. chug . a . 
LUG! 

IV 

D uring the remainder of the run 
Uncle Lionel acquainted St 
George with the finer points of fire- 
manship. St. George, whose main 
ambition as a child had been to be- 
come an engineer on a hyper-Diesel, 
was enchanted. True, this quaint 
little woodbumer was a far cry from 
a hyper-Diesel; nevertheless, it had 



one beat seventy different ways 
from Sunday, for, like all mass- 
produced vehicles, hyper-Diesels had 
about as much character as a tube 
of toothpaste. The dragonmotive, on 
the other hand, had character ga- 
lore. You had to know its whims 
and its ways and cater to them, and 
if you didn’t, it simply wouldn’t 
co-operate. There were no dials or 
gauges of any kind, and everything 
had to be done by guess and by 
golly, and you never knew from one 
minute to the next whether (1) the 
train was going to tip over, (2) the 
boiler was going to blow up or (3) 
the wheels were going to leave the 
track. 

Unfortunately, the roadbed had 
character too. The rails had been 
laid in six-foot lengths and, far from 
being true to begin with, were ren- 
dered even more erratic by improp- 
erly machined tie plates and the 
uneven contraction and expansion of 
the individual sections. In addition, 
many of the crossties had already 
been settled and needed to be re- 
placed, and none of the curves was 
adequately banked. Sometimes the 
little engine swayed, sometimes it 
bumped up and down, sometimes it 
jerked. Most of the time it did all 
three at once. 

“Water towers” had been pswMd- 
cd at regular intervals for the drag- 
onmotive to slake its thirst These 
were natural springs located on ab- 
rupt hillsides. Their water was “pip- 
ed” into trestle-supported sluices 
that could be “turned on and off* 
by means of small floodgates. St 
George found them almost as en- 
chanting as the dragonmotive. 



82 



ir 




For the most part, the villages 
that the little train serviced were 
like the first one he’d seen — hand- 
fuls of hovels, shops and pigsties. 
He learned subsequently that there 
were nine of them altogether. Their 
inhabitants, plus the operators of the 
small vegetable and sheep farms 
scattered over the countryside, con- 
stituted the train’s only passengers. 
He received the definite impression 
that most of them were riding the 
coaches for kicks rather than from 
any need to travel from point A to 
point B; but at least they were rid- 
ing them, which was more than you 
could say for the local leisure class 
as represented by Sirs Guy and 
Bagdemagus. 

At first thought, it seemed that 
the opposite should have been 
the case — that the nobility, rather 
than the peasantry, would have ac- 
cepted the dragonmotive for what 
it was and that the latter would 
have been the ones to interpret it 
along superstitious lines. But not on 
second thought. Like all primitive 
peasants, the inhabitants of Lianour 
believed in monsters galore; but they 
worked from dawn to dusk and had 
little time for initiating legends and 
even less for playing games, and as 
a result their imaginations, for want 
of exercise, were flabby. Consequent- 
ly, they saw things pretty much as 
things really were, whether they 
wanted to or not. 

The nobility, on the other hand, 
had all the time in the world to 
initiate legends and to play games* 
As a matter of fact, that was just 
about all they did. And since basi- 
cally they weren’t one whit less ig- 



norant than the peasantry, they saw 
only what they wanted to see. 
Equally essential to their “adven- 
tures” was their willingness to be- 
lieve one another’s lines. It had ac- 
tually become a convention. If Sir 
So & So said he had seen a dragon. 
Sir What’s His Name would say he 
had seen one too — and devoutly 
believe he was telling the truth. 

C asianna Jones seemed to sense 
St. George’s thoughts, for she 
voiced the subject aloud. “Sithen” 
going into the transportation busi- 
ness, she said, she and her uncle had 
been harassed almost daily, both by 
members of the local knighthood 
and by wandering knights searching 
for the Sangreal. Fortunately, none 
of either species had ever tried to 
break one of the engine’s “legs” — 
an act that, were it ever carried out 
successfully, would result in the en- 
gine’s derailment and in all prob- 
ability agitate the fire in the firebox 
to such an extent that the boiler 
would blow up. And fortunately 
none of them had ever thought to 
direct his attack against the coaches, 
which, along with the “legs”, con- 
stituted the train’s most vulnerable 
areas. Should the former eventuality 
come to pass, it would spell the end 
of the little railroad, because none 
of the employees was capable of 
making the necessary repairs with- 
out supervision, and the mead Uncle 
Lionel was forced to drink daily to 
maintain his health had had an ad- 
verse effect on his mechanical prow- 
ess, reducing him to jelly when it 
came to effecting even a minor re- 
pair job. (All of which put him 



ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGONMOTIVE 



83 




pretty much on a par with St. 
George who, sad to relate, was a 
hopeless dud when it came to ac- 
complishing anything more mechani- 
cally complicated than screwing a 
nut on a bolt.) 

Casianna took an even dimmer 
view of knight-errants than our hero 
did. “La! such children,” she said. 
“Were it not for men like mine 
uncle Lionel they would not even 
have armor to wear. Were it not 
for men like my cousin Alfred of 
Gloomis they would not even have 
weapons to carry. And were it not 
for men like my cousin Charles, the 
which doth raise sheep in this val- 
ley, they would not even have gar- 
ments to put upon their backs or 
meat to put into their mouths. They 
can do nothing for themselves — it 
must be done for them. And now 
they would joust with the oxenless 
oxcart, the which mine uncle Lionel 
and my grandfather, who became 
aweary a twelve-month ago and died, 
spent many years a-building!” 

St. George looked at her. She re- 
turned his gaze without batting an 
eye. When it came to playing a past- 
part, Casianna Jones didn’t have to 
take a back seat for anybody. 

He looked at Uncle Lionel. The 
old man was doing all right too, 
only he was only partly playing a 
part. He’d got a jug of mead from 
somewhere and was leaning against 
the wall, chug-a-lugging at regular 
intervals. The railroad, by twenty- 
first century standards, wasn’t very 
much to write home about, but just 
the same it was difficult to under- 
stand how a twenty-first century lush 
had managed to build it. 



“Mead makes mine Uncle Lionel 
come on live,” Casianna Jones said, 
seemingly sensing St. George’s puz- 
zlement but ascribing it to the wrong 
cause. “Were it not for the great 
draughts he takes upon arising and 
upon retiring and the little draughts 
he takes in between, he would not 
have the strength wherewith to carry 
out his tasks.” 

St. George had to admit that it 
was a pretty good sixth-century ex- 
planation. But naturally it threw no 
light on the real cause of his puz- 
zlement. Maybe Uncle Lionel had 
only recently become a lush. It was 
unusual, granted, but not unheard 
of; and certainly it was no worse 
than becoming a 3V addict and ce- 
menting one’s backside to a view- 
chair for the duration of one’s twi- 
light years. 

V 

T he little train had entered a 
large woods, and presently Ca- 
sianna Jones brought it to a halt on 
the outskirts of a village consider- 
ably larger than any of the others 
St. George had seen. Most of the 
passengers had got off by this time; 
now the rest of them did, and this, 
together with the fact that no more 
got on and the day was very nearly 
done, tipped him off that the train 
was nearing the end of the line. 

Casianna threw the throttle for- 
ward, and the dragonmotive chug-ch 
lugged through the rest of the woods, 
emerged on a medium-sized plain, 
and headed for a hill the size of a 
small mountain. 

The rails stretched straight toward 

IF 



84 




a wide opening at the hill’s base, but 
before they reached it they joined — 
or were joined by — another set of 
rails that angled off obliquely to the 
north. It was, St. George realized, 
the same set of rails the train was 
traveling on now: the railroad sim- 
ply circled the valley and returned 
to where it had started, and that was 
its entire extent — unless the tunnel 
toward which the train was now 
heading passed all the way through 
the hill. 

It did not, although at first it 
gave every indication of doing so. 
Originally, it had been a horizontal 
mine shaft — St. George saw that 
right away. Then, probably over a 
period of years, it had been exten- 
sively enlarged and skillfully and 
firmly shored with oak timbers. Un- 
doubtedly it provided access to the 
very veins that had supplied the ore 
from which both the dragonmotive 
and the rails had been made. 

When daylight gave out, torches 
in wall brackets took over. The tun- 
nel maintained a uniform width and 
height for about a hundred yards; 
then it doubled in width, providing 
room for a small siding. At this 
point, Casianna brought the train 
to a halt and Uncle Lionel, who 
had already doubled as conductor, 
now doubl^ as brakeman; got out, 
and threw a switch. When she pulled 
onto the siding, he uncoupled the 
coaches and threw a second switch, 
allowing the engine to go on, leaving 
the coaches behind. He followed on 
foot. 

A few moments later, the dragon- 
motive entered a huge natural cav- 
ern. The rails came to an end in 

ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGONMOTIVE 



the middle of the floor, and St. 
George, climbing down from the cab, 
saw that they were mounted on a 
large swivel so that the engine and 
the wood-car could be turned around 
and faced in the opposite direction. 
The coaches could ^en be recoup- 
led from behind and the train could 
leave the tunnel on the next day’s 
run and circle the valley in the op- 
posite direction. 

Very clever, St. George thought. 
Very clever. But why should a pair 
of pastimers go to so much trouble 
just so they could lug a bunch of 
farmers, shopkeepers, sheepherders 
and smithies around a sixth-century 
countryside? 

A t its highest point, the cavern 
ceiling was about fifty feet 
above the floor. There was a good- 
sized opening in it that extended all 
the way to the surface of the hill- 
side, after the manner of a flue. It 
looked as though it had been dug out 
by hand, and directly below it was 
a large forge, at which a number of 
men were at work shaping rails. 
Discounting a handful of fad^ day- 
light filtering down through the flue, 
the only illumination came from 
torches burning in wall bradcets, and 
what with their smoke and the fumes 
from the forge, the place had the 
aspect of a foundry during teeming^ 
time. 

On the other side of the tracks 
was a machine shop. Here, working 
at foot-pedal powered Rube Gold- 
berg-like contritions that in some 
cases resembled lafiies, in others 
planers, and in others grinds, were 
still other men. Many at them were 

8S 




old, quite a number of them were 
middle-aged, and a few of them were 
young. St. George concluded that 
both they and the forgemen hailed 
from the village in the woods and 
that the railroad provided their sole 
source of employment and that in 
the case of the older men they had 
participated in its construction. 

After climbing down from the 
cab, Casianna Jones went over to 
where a large iron bell hung on a 
tripod, and struck it three times 
with a small sledge hammer. Im- 
mediately, the employees began 
making preparations to quit for the 
day. Laying aside the hammer, she 
beckoned to St. George, and when 
he joined her, led him through a 
small archway into a chamber that, 
partially at least, had been hollowed 
out of solid rock. It gave into three 
smaller chambers, contained a 
hearth, a crude wooden table, two 
crude wooden benches, and a crude 
wooden cupboard. She indicated one 
of the benches, and he sat down; 
then she went to the cupboard, got 
utensils and earthenware, and set 
three places at the table. She began 
to prepare supper. 

Supper turned out to be meat, 
mead and black bread. Like most 
pastimers, Casianna and Uncle Lion- 
el ate, as well as lived and acted, 
the way the “Romans” did, St. 
George thought wistfully of the 
goodies in Herodotus’ croup-compart- 
ment. Uncle Lionel came in when 
the meal was half over. He was 
drunker than a hoot owl, but not 
so drunk he couldn’t help count 
the contents of the sheepskin bag 
when Casianna carried it to the 



table afterward. The contents turn- 
ed out to be leircs — a forerunner 
of the styca that up till now St. 
George hadn’t known existed. There 
was a big pile of them, and the girl 
and the old man had to count them 
four times apiece before they were 
able to arrive at a common total. 

St. George stared at the coins. 
They were made of iron, no two of 
them were identical, and the outline 
of a lion that had been etched upon 
each of them bore even less resem- 
blance to the king of beasts than 
the woolly mammoths Cro-Magnon 
man used to paint on cave walls bore 
to the woolly mammoth. Neverthe- 
less, on the twenty-first century nu- 
mismatics market they would bring 
millions of dollars. 

No wonder Uncle Lionel and his 
niece had gone into the railroad 
business! What better way could 
you collect small coins than by haul- 
ing passengers for brief distances? 
True, diminutive as it was, the rail- 
road still represented a vast under- 
taking; but how much of the actual 
work had the two pastimers done? 
None of it, St. George would bet. 
And he would also bet that they’d 
be doing none of the operational 
work now if their employees weren’t 
afraid to go near the dragonmotivo 
when it was “on live”. 

B ut they did more than merely 
operate the train, he discovered 
presently. Either the employees were 
as afraid to work at night as they 
were to fire and run the dragon- 
motive or Casianna and/or Uncle 
Lionel didn’t believe in paying over- 
time. In any event, supper didn’t

usher in the period of leisure St. 
George had been looking forward 
to. It ushered in more work instead. 
In Casianna’s case, this consisted of 
cleaning the coaches; and in Uncle 
Lionel’s case, checking the dragon- 
motive for loose fixtures and oiling 
its movable parts; and in St. George’s 
(after Casianna supplied him with 
a pair of Uncle Lionel’s shoes), 
splitting wood, three dozen cord of 
which were piled in one corner of 
the cavern for the next day’s run 
He’d had jobs he liked far better, 
and he was glad when she came 
around some three hours later and 
told him it was time to go to bed. 

After she spread a pallet for him 
in one of the small chambers and 
said good night and left, he lay down 
and waited till he was sure both she 
and her uncle were asleep; then he 
got up, tiptoed out of tibe living 
quarters, entered the tunnel, and 
made his way toward the entrance. 
He was surprised, after passing the 
siding, to find his way barred by 
a portcullis, although acquainted as 
he was with the dragon-hunting ob- 
session of the knighthood, he 
shouldn’t have been. 

The portcullis was connected to 
a primitive winch, and it was the 
work of but a moment to raise the 
ponderous affair the few feet neces- 
sary to permit to crawl in under 
it. Stepping into the starlight a few 
minutes later, he encephalopathed 
Herodotus to join him, and when he 
saw the rohorse trotting toward him 
across the plain he went to meet it, 
mounted it, and redirected its foot- 
steps toward the woods. After find- 
ing a suitable hiding place for it 



in an isolated glen, he psyche-pro- 
grammed it to remain there till 
otherwise directed; then he dis- 
mounted and started back to the 
tunnel on foot. Just as he was leav- 
ing the glen he heard a crackling 
sound in the underbrush off to his 
right, and paused. He peered into 
the darkness, caught a brief glimpse 
of something gleaming in the star- 
light. But the phenomenon was not 
repeated, and strain his eyes as he 
would he could not see anything. 
Finally he concluded that his eyes 
had played a trick on him and that 
some small animal had been respon- 
sible for the crackling sound, and 
continued on his way. 

When he reached the tunnel, he 
crawled beneath the portcullis, low- 
ered it, made his way back to the 
living quarters and lay back down 
on his pallet. 

It would be no trick at all for him 
to handle a young girl and an old 
lush. If he wanted to he could take 
both Casianna and Uncle Lionel into 
custody right now and, after put- 
ting the dragonmotive out of com- 
mission by blowing up its boiler, 
escort them to the timeshipstop, and 
notify IP Headquarters via time- 
wave radio that he was ready to be 
picked up. He was reasonably cer- 
tain that no one else was in on the 
deal. If there were he could always 
come back for them later. Why, 
then, didn’t he get on the ball and 
wrap up the case without further 
ado? 

It was a good question, and one 
that he had trouble answering. Fi- 
nally, though, the answer came: He 
wanted to ride in the little engine

IF 




again — to fire its boiler, to blow 
its whistle, if Casianna would let 
him and — also if Casianna would 
let him — sit behind the throttle and 
be the engineer. Tweet-tweet! the 
whistle went in his mind. Chug-a-lug, 
went the dragonmotive. Chug-a-lug, 
chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug-lug-lug . 

VI 

M orning was at “six of the 
clock”. Breakfast was black 
bread and mead — for Casianna and 
St George, that is. For Uncle Lion- 
el, it was just mead. The latter was 
left behind in charge of the shop, 
where the workday began at seven, 
and the little train left the tunnel 
at seven-thirty. 

The first stop was the village in 
the woods. Two passengers got on, 
and St. George, who was now con- 
ductor and brakeman as well as fire- 
man, got the sheepskin bag and col- 
lected the fares. When the train was 
under motion again, he asked Casi- 
anna if he could run the engine, and 
she said he could. 

First she showed him how. To go 
ahead, you shoved the throttle for- 
ward; to slow down, you pulled it 
back; to stop, you pulled it all the 
way back and applied the brakes; 
and to back up, you threw a lever 
that reversed the position of the two 
drivingwheel rods. All the rest was 
a matter of judgment. 

She let him be the engineer for 
a whole hour, sitting beside him on 
the little bench that constituted the 
“driver’s seat”. He’d never had so 
much fun in his life. It wasn’t work- 
ing the throttle so much that in- 

ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGONMOTIVE 



trigued him — it was sitting by the 
window and watching the idyllic 
countryside drift by and seeing the 
dragonmotive’s legs pump up and 
down. The little engine took a liking 
to him right away and responded 
to his every wish. Sometimes it var- 
ied its constant “conversation”. 
When it was going up a hill, it said 
Chug-a-LUG, chug-a-LlJG, Chug-a- 
LUG. When it was going down one, 
it said, CmJG-a-lug, CWJG-a-lug, 
CYi\JG-a-lug. And when it was going 
around a curve, it said Chug-chug- 
chug-chug-CR\JG ! 

Casianna Jones had packed a 
lunch. They ate while the dragon- 
motive was taking on water midway 
in the run. Black bread, meat and 
mead, of course. Sitting beside her 
on the cab steps with the water 
gurgling down the sluiceway above 
their heads and a wind from the 
south blowing her hair and crinkling 
the gay blue dress she had donned 
that morning, he couldn’t help wish- 
ing that the railroad was on the up 
and up and that he could remain in 
the sixth century and go on being 
her fireman and part-time engineer 
forever. 

So persistent was the wish that 
it remained with him after the run 
was resumed, and he had to remind 
himself several times over that he 
was almost thirty and that thirty- 
year old men had no business trying 
to fulfill childhood ambitions even 
under ideal circumstances, and that 
for him to try to fulfill his under 
the present circumstances would 
constitute a flagrant dereliction of 
duty. 

To make up for his apostasy, he 

89 




asked Casianna to tell him how the 
little train had come into being, 
hoping to catch her in a slip of the 
tongue or a contradiction or two. He 
expected her to be reluctant to dis- 
cuss the dragonmotive’s history, but 
apparently she’d fabricated it before- 
hand. In any case, she plunged into 
it without further encouragement. 

/t ccording to her, the railroad was 
the result of two discoveries — 
one made by her grandfather and 
one by her Uncle Lionel — and a 
number of ingenious devices invent- 
ed by her father. Her grandfather 
had been a miner, and while still a 
young man had found out that the 
oxcarts he used to transport ore 
could be operated much more easily 
if planks were laid down for the 
wheels to roll on. Also a part-time 
armor-maker, he discovered that the 
carts functioned even more efficient- 
ly when the rims of the wheels and 
the surfaces of the planks were cov- 
ered with strips of iron and more 
efficiently still when the plank-strips 
were raised and the wheel-strips 
were flanged. Coincidentally, Uncle 
Lionel, who was really Casianna’s 
great uncle and who lived with his 
brother and his brother’s family in 
a natural cavern just off the main 
mine shaft, 4iscovered while brew- 
ing a batch of mead that steam im- 
prisoned in a sealed kettle would, if 
properly directed and provided with 
the right apparatus, perform any 
number of laborious and irksome 
tasks. He began experimenting with 
larger and larger kettles and even- 
tually came up with a boiler capable 
of generating sufficient power to 



turn a large wheel that, when pro- 
vided with the right attachments, 
could swing a sledge hammer with 
twice the efficiency and thrice the 
power of “the strongest wrought- 
iron maker on live”. 

From that moment on. Uncle 
Lionel’s chores were ten times less 
onerous and consumed only a frac- 
tion of their former time. He utiliz- 
ed his new leisure to brew bigger 
and better batches of mead and to 
build bigger and better boilers. It 
was at this juncture that the notion 
occurred either to him or to Casi- 
anna’s grandfather (both had claim- 
ed the distinction) that the boiler 
might be installed on the ore cart 
in such a way as to turn the wheels. 
Years passed before a workable 
drive was devised, but finally the 
forerunner of the dragonmotive was 
born. 

In the meantime, Casianna’s fa- 
ther had been born, and it was he, 
in close association with the steam- 
powered ore cart almost from in- 
fancy, who had conceived the idea 
of building a much more powerful 
locomotive and a system of rails 
over which it could pull passenger- 
carrying coaches. He had invented 
and built the necessary machines and 
hired the necessary labor and, after 
obtaining the necessary land-rights 
from the freemen of Lianour, super- 
vised the laying of the roadbed and 
the rails. Thirty years had already 
passed since Uncle Lionel and his 
brother had crossed discoveries; 
thirty more passed before Casianna’s 
father got all of the bugs out of his 
project, during which time Casianna 
was born and during which time her 



90 



IF 




mother, unhealthy to begin with, 
“died of a vapor”. Three months 
ago, while widening the tunnel her 
father had been killed by a falling 
timber; but by that time the rail- 
road had become a reality, and it 
had remained but for her and her 
Uncle Lionel to put the finishing 
touches on the engine and the 
coaches, and commence operations. 

F or a long while after she finished 
speaking, St. George didn’t say 
anything. He couldn’t. Why, she 
must take him for a simpleton to 
imagine he’d believe that a trio of 
sixth-century freemen could have 
accomplished in sixty years that 
which v/ould someday require cen- 
turies! 

He reminded himself that that 
was undoubtedly what she did take 
him for — a sixth-century simpleton 
with a strong back and a weak mind. 
But it was a compliment to his 
prowess as an actor and provided 
some salve at least for the wound 
it had inflicted upon his ego. So he 
let on that he’d swallowed the whole 
story, and said simply, “It’s time for 
me to feed the fire, fair damsel,” 
and set about doing so. 

He was closing the firebox door 
some five minutes later, after adding 
several armloads of wood to the 
flames, when she cried, “There be 
many knights acoming, fair sir. 
Look!” 

He joined her at the window. 
Sure enough, at least a dozen would- 
be dragon-slayers were approaching 
on horseback across the fields. Every 
last one of them wore chain mail, 
and Sir Ulfin du Bois was in the 



lead. Sir Guy and Sir Bagdemagus 
were present too. St. George recog- 
nized them by their horses. 

“Whooo-eeee!” shouted Sir Guy. 
“Yeahhhhhhhh!” hollered Sir Bag- 
demagus. “We have come to rescue 
ye from the foul fiend the which 
hath devoured ye!” called Sir Ulfin. 

Down went their visors. Down 
went the visors of the rest of the 
knights. Spears were dressed and 
spurs applied; the charge began. 

“Oh, go on home and tend to 
your castles!” St. George said. But 
he didn’t bother to shout, because 
he knew it wouldn’t have done any 
good. 

Why, he wondered suddenly, 
didn’t the damn fools wait till the 
train stopped at the next village and 
then attack? Surely they must rea- 
lize that a “dragon” at rest was far 
more vulnerable than a “dragon” in 
motion. Was it because they knew 
instinctively that once the train stop- 
ped, the dragon-illusion would fall 
prey to reality? 

After all, when you came right 
down to it, all they were doing was 
playing games, and in their hearts 
they must be aware of the fact. 

S irs Guy and Bagdemagus reached 
the dragonmotive first, outdis- 
tancing Sir Ulfin, and gave a repeat 
performance of their over-the-croup 
act of the day before. Sir Ulfin 
broke another spear, again manag- 
ing to remain seated, and withdrew 
his sword and once more began 
beating the boiler plating. The rest 
of the attackers fared the same as 
Sirs Guy and Bagdemagus had, and 
their chain mail jingled so loudly 



ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGONMOTIVE 



91 




when they hit the ground it all but 
drowned out the chug-a-lugging of 
the engine. 

Clang! went Sir Ulfin’s sword 
against the boiler plating, as St. 
George and Casianna Jones looked 
down at him in disgust. Clang! 
Clang! Clang! Then something un- 
expected happened: the right sleeve 
of Sir Ulfin’s ulster became en- 
tangled with the connecting rod, his 
sword went flying, and he was yank- 
ed halfway out of his saddle. All 
that saved him from having his arm 
torn off was the defectiveness of the 
chain mail at the juncture of sleeve 
and shoulder. The sleeve came free 
and he managed to get his arm out 
of it just in time. He reined his steed 
then, and in a few moments the 
dragonmotive left him far behind, a 
sadder — and, it was to be hoped — 
a wiser man. 

At the next stop, St. George dis- 
entangled the sleeve and tossed it 
into the cab. Maybe Uncle Lionel 
could find some use for it. 

Come to think of it, though, 
Uncle Lionel wasn’t going to be 
around long enough to find any use 
for it. Tonight, he and one Casianna 
Jones, or Rebecca L’Ouvertures, or 
whatever you cared to call her, were 
going to be taken into custody by 
one Lt. Geo. St. George of the 
Pastpolice, and escorted back to the 
present to answer a charge of “wH- 
fuUy interfering with things-past”. 
And the dragonmotive they had 
built to mulct leircs out of past per- 
sons was going to develop a violent 
case of heartburn and be blown to 
smithereens. 

St. George was sad throughout the 



remainder of the run. He hated to 
do what he had to do, but he simply 
couldn’t put it off any longer. The 
dragonmotive seemed to sense his 
sadness. Chug-a-lug, it said. Chug- 
chug-a-lug. Chug , . chug • . 
chug . 

VII 

U ncle Lionel was drunker than 
two hoot owls when they arriv- 
ed in the cavern. He was passing 
a jug of mead around to the em- 
ployees and telling them in effect 
that if they worked hard and kept 
their noses clean, they, too, might 
someday become a railroad tycoon 
like himself. Casianna Jones put an 
end to the proceedings in a hurry. 
Confiscating the jug, she dismissed 
the men for the day; then, with St. 
George’s help, she poured Uncle 
Lionel into bed. She looked tired, 
St. George noticed. Well, it wasn’t 
any wonder. Running a railroad, 
virtually all by one’s self was hard 
enough without having to play nurse- 
maid to a drunk. 

She was so tired, in fact, that she 
announced after supper that she 
was going to skip cleaning the 
coaches and go right to bed. St. 
George, though, would have to split 
enough wood for tomorrow’s run; 
also, if he got the chance, she wish- 
ed he’d check the oxenless oxcart 
before turning in. 

He smiled ruefully after she said 
good night and entered her bed 
chamber. In a way, he felt sorry for 
her. But, being human, he felt far 
sorrier for himself as he got out the 
ax and set up the first block of 



92 



IP 




wood. He wished he’d never come 
back to the sixth century — had 
never seen the dragonmotive, or 
Casianna Jones either, for that mat- 
ter. A man could want to do some- 
thing all his life and not be able 
to do it and still not mind very much 
so long as he never accidentally got 
to do it. But once he did it once, 
everything changed. Then he wanted 
to go on doing it forever. It seemed 
to him that Fate, which was always 
cruel anyway, had been uncommonly 
cruel. Not only could he not do the 
thing he loved — he must kill the 
thing he loved. 

When he had enough wood split, 
he loaded it into the woodcar. Then 
he threw an armful into the embers 
that remained in the firebox from 
the day’s run. Little flames appeared; 
he fanned them till they grew to 
adulthood. He added more wood. 
The boiler still had water in it from 
the last “water tower”. He added 
more from the hillside spring that 
the two pastimers had piped down 
into the cavern for hygienic and 
industrial purposes. Returning to the 
cab, he resumed building the fire. 
He hoped Casianna was a sound 
sleeper, as it would be much easier 
to take care of the dragonmotive 
first and then make his arrests. He 
wasn’t worried about Uncle Lionel: 
nothing short of an earthquake 
could arouse him from his sodden 
slumber. 

The swivel had already been given 
a half-turn, and after St. George 
had built up sufficient pressure all 
he had to do was throw the two 
siding switches and drive the dragon- 
motive out of the tunnel. Midway 



between the tunnel’s mouth and the 
woods, he brought the engine to a 
halt and began adding more wood 
to the fire. 

And more and more and more 
and more. 

All the stars were out, and Lia- 
nour slept peacefully beneath them. 
The plain glimmered palely in the 
long-gone night. The flames in the 
firebox grew. 

St. George felt awful. 

I t wouldn’t have been so bad if 
the dragonmotive hadn’t taken 
a liking to him right from the start 
and responded like a worshipful pup- 
py to his every command. It 
wouldn’t have been so bad either if 
it had looked like the Lancashire 
Witch or even The John Bull, in- 
stead of that most enchanting of all 
collector’s items, the Stourbridge 
Lion. Nor would it have been so 
bad if the little engine had been a 
deadringer for the Stourbridge Lion 
and lacked, as a consequence, a 
uniqueness of its own. But the way 
matters stood, destroying it was like 
destroying the last-remaining Model 
T or the last-remaining Stanley 
Steamer. It was a crime against civ- 
ilization. 

St. George sighed, threw a final 
armful of wood into the firebox. 
“I hate to do this to you, doll,” he 
said, “but there isn’t any other way.” 
The dragonmotive rumbled deep 
in its “belly”, and St. George pre- 
pared to depart. He reached for the 
firebox door, intending to close it 
— realized just in time that the 
handle, owing to the greater than 
usual intensity of the fire, would be 



ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGONMOTIVE 



93 




hot. He looked around for some- 
thing to wrap around it, and his eyes 
alighted on the chain-mail sleeve 
he’d tossed into the cab that after- 
noon. He picked it up, noticing for 
the first time how light it was. Why, 
it was downright flimsy! No wonder 
it had pulled free. 

He was abput to wrap it around 
the handle when an inscription 
caught his eye. It had been engraved 
— or stamped — on one of the links 
midway between the cuff and the 
ragged edge where the sleeve had 
parted from the rest of the ulster, 
and it consisted of three words. 
English words. He stared at them 
in the glow of the fire. 

Made in Japan 

they said. 

The sleeve slipped from his fin- 
gers, jingled to the floor. He stood 
there, stunned. 

H e remembered the suits of chain 
mail the attacking knights had 
been wearing that afternoon. 

He remembered Sir Guy and Sir 
Bagdemagus saying how much they 
admired Sir Ulfin du Bois’ chain- 
mail ensemble and that he’d promis- 
ed to procure similar suits for them 
from the very armor-maker who’d 
created his own, and for a most 
modest sum. 

Wholesale? 

He remembered the crackling 
sound he’d heard in the underbrush 
the night before when he was leav- 
ing the glen where he’d hidden He- 
rodotus. He remembered the gleam 
he’d glimpsed in the darkness — 



Starlight reflecting on chain mail? 

Sir Ulfin’s? 

For damn sure he had a batch of 
suits cached somewhere. 

But if Sir Ulfin du Bois was a 
pastiming suit-salesman from the 
twenty-first century, then he was 
responsible for the anachronism the 
detector had picked up. And since 
the detector had registered only one 
anachronism, the dragonmotive 
wasn’t a true anachronism ^after all. 

That being so, there was no need 
to eliminate it. In point of fact, elim- 
inating it might adversely affect 
the very status quo St. George had 
come back in time to preserve. 

Frantically, he closed the flue and 
began to bank the fire. He still 
couldn’t bring himself to believe that 
a trio of sixth-century freemen 
could have started from scratch and 
built a railroad in a time-span of 
sixty years, and even if he could 
have believed it, it still wouldn’t 
have made sense, because if he 
hadn’t removed the dragonmotive 
from the time stream, who had? 
However, he was more than willing 
to give the little engine the benefit 
of a doubt, and if he could catch 
Sir Ulfin du Bois with the goods, he 
would consider the case closed. 

After he finished banking the fire, 
he left the cab and started across 
the plain toward the woods. Maybe 
there was a cache and maybe there 
wasn’t. If there was, he’d find it — 
either tonight or tomorrow — and 
when Sir Ulfin revisited it, he’d be 
there waiting for him. 

But assuming there was a cache 
and assuming that Sir Ulfin really 
was the culprit and hadn’t been 



94 



IF 




taken in by a pastimer himself in 
another part of “Logris” (where the 
anachronism would have shown up), 
how was it possible to accept the 
railroad as a bona fide anachron- 
ism? 

It simply wasn't possible. 

Wasn’t it? 

Granted, Uncle Lionel was a lush 
now, but that didn’t mean he’d al- 
ways been one. He could have been 
a genius in his day, and so could 
Casianna’s father and grandfather 
have been. And then, too, there was 
the consideration that two separate 
discoveries had been made coinci- 
dentally. Maybe that was the key. 
Separately, the discoveries might not 
have amounted to much; but com- 
bined, they could have amounted to 
a great deal. Each could have pro- 
vided impetus for the other, and ac- 
celerated the development of the 
dragonmotive. 

S uppose Edison had had a brother 
whose inventive genius equalled 
his own? And suppose that the two 
men had made breakthroughs in two 



different fields simultaneously? Why, 
there was no telling what they 
might have come up with! Maybe 
it hadn’t even been invented yet. 

Two heads were better than one, 
just as the truism maintained; but 
the truism didn’t go far enough. Two 
good heads were infinitely better 
than one. And in the present in- 
stance, there had been three . 

Given the right conditions, the 
right minds, the right timing — any^ 
thing was possible. Even a sixth- 
century railroad. 

Nevertheless, St. George still 
didn’t believe it. He was surprised, 
therefore, when — shortly after en- 
tering the woods — he saw a light 
shining in the darkness some several 
hundred yards to his left. In the di- 
rection of the glen. He began pick- 
ing his way among the trees, and at 
length he came to a small clearing. 

He paused at the edge of it. Star- 
ed. A knight in shining armor was 
shining a pocket torch into a hollow 
tree. Beside the knight stood a horse. 
No, not a horse — a rohorse. A pro- 
duct, St. George realized now, of

Lead-off story in the January IF will be one of your favor-

the issue: The Moonrakers. We saw Poul and his lovely wife, 
Karen, a few weeks ago in London, at what seemed to be the 
midpoint of an earnest attempt to visit most of the countries of 
Europe; they had been wandering through Scandinavia and the 
northern countries in general for about two months, and were 
about to explore the British Isles. So it may be a while before he 
gets back to writing again — and meanwhile, we're pleased to 
have this one for you!

the same factory that had manufac- 
tured Herodotus. Its croup-lid was 
raised, and the knight was engaged 
in transferring objects from the hol- 
low tree to the compartment — 
objects that gleamed in the starlight 
and gave forth jingling sounds. 

St. George was indignant. The 
nerve of the man! Masquerading as 
a knight of the Round Table and 
pretending to joust with a “dragon” 
for the benefit of his customers and 
carrying on his activities within the 
time-space sphere of a true anach- 
ronism so that their emanations 
would be ascribed to the wrong 
cause! He’d spotted St. George right 
off the bat, for the simple reason 
that he’d been expecting him, and 
he’d been so cocksure of himself 
that he hadn’t even bothered to 
move his cache even though it was 
right under St. George’s nose! And 
if he hadn’t lost his sleeve — the tell- 
tale inscription on which he was un- 
doubtedly unaware of — he’d have 
got away with his subterfuge and 
have gone back to the present with 
enough leircs to have made him a 
rich man. 

He’d been so contemptuous of St. 
George’s intelligence that even St. 
George’s near discovery of him the 
night before hadn’t fazed him, and 
he was so contemptuous of it tonight 
that even the distant chug-a4ugging 
of the dragonmotive failed to signal 
danger in his mind. St. George 
crept up behind him, applied a re- 
verse choke-hold and found a jiujitsu 
pressure-point. “What’s your real 
name, Sir Ulfin?” he asked. 

“Sir Ulfin” gave a start. Then he 
sighed. “Ulfie Woods,” he said. 



“Come on,” said our hero. “We’re 
going for a ride.” 

vin 

I t is a matter of record that shortly 
after Lt. George St. George turn- 
ed Ulfie Woods over to the present- 
side authorities he resigned from the 
Pastpolice Force and that not long 
afterward he disappeared, never to 
be seen again. It is also a matter of 
record that the Anachronism De- 
partment wrote off his allusions in 
his report to a sixth-century railroad 
as sheer nonsense and didn’t bother 
to investigate the matter. Hence, we 
will have to turn to a hitherto un- 
published chapter of Sir Thomas 
Malory’s Le Morte d* Arthur for the 
conclusion — and the verification — 
of our story. For some reason this 
chapter got left out of the Caxton 
and subsequent editions of the work, 
and only recently came to light. It 
follows verbatim: 

A tte last syr Ector de Maris & 
syr Bors cam to the cuntreye 
of Lianoure, & ther they sawe a 
dragonne the which had devoured a 
fayr damsel & a noble knyghte &

IF ♦ Short Story 





If seemed like a reasonable 
idea — some dainties for the 
comfort of the astronauts— 



S en. McDermott: Now, Mr. Haw- 
kins, J want you to realize that 
this private hearing is not a trial, 
nor are you charged with any crime. 

Mr. Hawkins: Is that why you 
recommended I bring my lawyer? 

Sen. McDermott: I only made 
that recommendation because some 
topics or questions concerning legal 
matters may be brought to the at- 
tention of the committee. The pur- 
pose of this hearing is merely to 
investigate reports of rather unor- 
thodox behavior . 

Mr. Hawkins: Ha! 

Sen. McDermott: . with regard 
to orbital satellites USSF numbers 
one eighty-seven and one ninety- 
three. I would appreciate your 
frankness on the matter. 

Mr. Hawkins: Let me assure you, 
Senator, that I have no intentions 
of being secretive, nor have I ever 
had any. However, as Director of 
the National Space Agency, I felt it 
best that certain information about 



those two space stations be put on 
a security list for the best of all 
concerned. 

Sen. McDermott: Spoken like a 
politician — you missed your calling, 
Mr. Hawkins. But tell me, this whole 
mess was your idea from the very 
start, wasn’t it? 

Mr. Hawkins: Yes, it was. 

Sen. McDermott: And when did 
the idea first come to you? 

Mr. Hawkins: About a year ago. 
I was doing some research . 

— Excerpt from official record 
(unpublished) 

Senate Special Investigatory Hearing 
October 10, 1996 

T he kind of research Jess Haw- 
kins was indulging in when the 
idea came to him may only be 
speculated upon. However, it is a 
fact that his friend, Bill Filmore, 
visited him in his office on Septem- 
ber 15, 1995. 

“Jess,” he said, “I’ve known you 



98 



for thirty-seven years, and when you 
go around grinning like a Cheshire 
cat, you’re hiding something. That 
pixie smile of yours is a dead give- 
away. As your best friend and a 
member of the Space Agency Board, 
I think I have a right to know 
what’s up your sleeve.” 

Hawkins looked at his friend. 
“All right, Bill, I guess I can trust 
you, but please keep all this in the 
strictest confidence. I believe Fve 
found a way to stimulate our astro- 
nauts’ heart muscles while they’re 
up in USSF 187 for prolonged per- 
iods.” 

“Why should you want to keep 
that a secret?” 

“Let me continue. We know that 
during sustained periods of freefall 
die heart tends to relax because it 
doesn’t have to work as hard to 
pump the blood under weightless 
conditions. Upon return to Earth, 
however, the heart muscles have 
difficulty readjusting to normal 
standards. We’ve already had three 
astronauts who suffered heart at- 
tacks when they came back, and one 
of them was damn near fatal. The 
calisthenics program the doctors in- 
stituted seems to have had little 
effect. I think the time has come 
for drastic measures.” 

“Just what is it that you propose?” 
“Think a minute. What is it that 
stimulates the heart, both literally 
and figuratively, is desirable enough 
for the men to use frequently, and 
is useful, besides, for improving mor- 
ale aboard the satellite?” 

“I never was much good at rid- 
dles, Jess.” 

“It can all be summed up in a 



common, everyday, three-letter 
word,” Hawkins grinned. “Sex.” 
Filmore stared a moment in si- 
lence, then said, “By God, Jess, I 
think you’re really serious.” 

The smile temporarily vanished 
from Hawkins’ face. “You’re damn 
right I am. Bill. We’ve been lucky 
so far, but there’s going to be a 
dead astronaut around soon if some- 
thing isn’t done. I’ve given the mat- 
ter a lot of thought, and I feel that 
shipping girls up to one eighty-seven 
is the best solution.” 

“But from an economic stand- 
point alone — ” 

“That’s why I’m hiring only Eu- 
ropean girls — they’re both cheaper 
and of better quality. I’ve already 
sent my aide, Wilbur Starling, over 
there to recruit some of their better 
English-speaking professionals. And 
what with air and water regenera- 
tion, cheap food concentrates, and 
the new atomic fuels, the cost of 
putting them up there and maintain- 
ing them is down to a ridiculous 
minimum.” 

“But it’s still a tidy sum. Where 
are you getting all the money?” 
“Oh, I appropriated it from the 
Astronauts’ Widows and Dependents 
Fund,” said Hawkins, the smile re- 
turning to his face. “That seemed 
the most likely place. I’ve also taken 
precautions, in case you were won- 
dering, about keeping this affair a 
secret. As Director, I have the power 
to classify anything I want. Not even 
the President will know about it.” 
“What about General Bullfat? 
He’s hated your guts ever since you 
were appointed over him to head the 
Agency.”

“Bill, you worry too much. Bull- 
fat has to look in the mirror every 
morning just to find his nose.” 
“Practical objections aside, Jess,” 
Filmore said desperately, “the whole 
idea is immoral. It’s just not the sort 
of thing a government executive 
should do.” 

“That is absolutely irrelevant. 
Morals don’t matter where there are 
men’s lives at stake.” 

Filmore stood up. “Jess, if I can’t 
talk you out of this ridiculous idea. 
I’ll go find someone who can.” 

“You wouldn’t fink on a friend, 
would you?” Hawkins asked, hurt. 

“It’s for your own good, Jess.” He 
started for the door. 

“It’s such a shame about you and 
Sylvia,” Hawkins said quietly. 

Filmore stopped. “What about me 
and Sylvia?” 

“Busting up such a nice marriage 
after thirteen years together.” 

“Sylvia and I are very happily 
married. We have no intentions of 
breaking up.” 

“You mean you haven’t told her 
about Gloria yet?” 

Filmore went slightly pale. “You 
know Gloria was only a momentary 
fling, Jess! You wouldn’t dare — ” 
“Fink on a friend? Of course not. 
Bill. It’s just that I have this annoy- 
ing habit of inadvertently blurting 
out the wrong thing at the wrong 
time. But be that as it may, don’t 
you think we ought to sit down and 
discuss the situation a little more?” 

A s she was getting dressed again, 
Wilbur Starling asked her, “Ba- 
bette, may I have a talk with you?” 
Babette looked at her watch. 



”You will ’ave to pay for anozzer 
hour,” she warned. 

“Your thinking is too narrow,” 
Starling said. “You’ve got your wholo 
life ahead of you. Instead of just 
worrying about your next hour, you 
should think of all the hours you 
have left.” 

“Please! Zey are enough taken 
one at a time.” 

“Don’t you want security in your 
old age, a good home — ” 

**Mon DieUy anozzer iparriage pro- 
posal!” 

“No, no, Babette honey, you don’t 
understand. You see, I represent tha 
United States government — ” 

“I know your consul very well,” 
she said helpfully. 

“That’s not what I meant. My 
government is willing to pay for 
your services in a special capacity.” 
“What must I do?” 

Starling’s face flushed ever so 
slightly. “Well, uh, the same thing 
you’ve been doing, only up in 
space.” 

“Space?” 

“Yes, you know. Like satellites, 
around the world, Shepard, Glenn, 
Hammond.” He made little whirring 
motions with his fingers. 

“Oh, oui** said Babette, suddenly 
comprehending. “Like A-OK.” 
“Yes,” Starling sighed. “A-OK 
and all that kind of stuff. Will you 
do it?” 

“iVo/i.” 

“Why not, Babette?” 

“It is too . too dangerous. I 
do not wish to lose my life going 
into . space.” 

“My government is willing to pay 
you — ” he made a quick mentid

estimate — “fire times your nomial 
fee. There’ll be eleven other ghis 
foing up with you, so you won’t be 
lonely. You’ll only have to work 
two or three hours a day. And now- 
adays, there’s no danger involved at 
all. Many women have gone into 
space and returned safely; they say 
that the conditions out in space are 
very restful. And when you retire, 
we’ll even provide you with a home 
and a pension fund, so that you cm 
spend your declining years in com- 
fort.” 

“All of zis just for me?” 

“Just for you,” 

Babette gulped and closed her 
eyes. “Zen where did I ever get ae 
impression zat Americans are — ’ow 
you say it? — pmdesT* 

S en. McDermott: And you say 
you recruited all these gbrli 
yourself? 

Mr. Starling: Yes, sir, I did. 
Sen. McDermott: Were most of 
them cooperative? 

Mr. Starling: That’s their job, sir. 
Sen. McDermott: I mean, what 
were their reactions to your unusual 
proposal? 

Mr. Starling: Well, they’ve prob- 
ably gotten a lot of unusual propos- 
als. They seemed to take it pretty 
much in stride. 

Sen. McDermott: One last ques- 
tion, Mr. Starling. How did you find 
this job? 

Mr. Starling: Very fatiguing, sir. 

ou must be very tired, Wil- 
jL bur,” Hawkins said, flash- 
ing his infamous smile. “How many 
girls did you say you interviewed?” 



“After twenty I stopped count- 
ing.” 

“And you’ve got a dozen all pick- 
ed out for us, eh?” 

“Yes sir, nine French and three 
British.” 

“Well, I guess you’ve earned your- 
self a vacation; you’ll get it as soon 
as the giris are safely tucked away 
on USSF 187. By Ae way, what 
are their names?” 

Starling closed his eyes, as though 
the names were written on the in- 
sides of his eyelids. “Let’s see, there’s 
Babette, Suzette, Lucette, Toillette, 
Francette, Violette, Rosette, Pearl- 
ette, Nanette, Myrtle, Constance, 
and Sydney.” 

“Sydney?” 

“I can’t help it. Boss, that’s her 
name.” 

“Oh well, I suppose it could have 
been worse,” Hawkins smiled. “Her 
last name could have been Aus- 
tralia.” 

“It is worse. Boss. Her last name 
is CartOT.” 

H awkins was giving the dozen 
new astronettes a pre-take-off 
pep-talk. “I like to think of you as 
a small army of Florence Nightin- 
gales,” he told them. “Hopefully, 
you will not receive all the credit 
that your brave act of self-sacrifice 
deserves, but nonetheless — ” 

Starling burst into the room, panic 
in his eyes. “General Bullfat’s com- 
ing down the corridor!” he cried. 

Filmore jumped up from the table 
he’d been sitting on. “Jess, are you 
sure you know what you’re doing? 
If Bullfat finds these girls — ” 

“Relax, Bill,” Hawkins smiled 



THE GIRLS ON USSF 193

casually. “I can handle Biillfat with 
both eyes closed. He’s a cinch.** 

“Who’s a cinch?” Bullfat roared 
as he entered the room. The general 
was a big man — but then, forty 
years behind a desk can do the same 
for anyone’s figure. 

“You are,” Hawkins said, turning 
calmly to face him “1 was just tell- 
ing Bill that you’re a cinch to be 
promoted to my job if I ever choose 
to resign.” 

Bullfat muttered incoherently. 
“Who are they?” he asked after a 
moment, indicating the girls. 

It was an apt question. The astro- 
nettes, contrary to normal procedure, 
had on loose-fitting, shaggy space- 
suits. Their face-plates were small, 
barely revealing their eyes and 
noses, while the rest of their heads 
were completely covered by the hel- 
mets. They would put one more in 
mind of baggy clowns than space 
travelers. 

“They’re the group scheduled to 
lift-off in about three hours. Would 
you like to meet them?” Filmore 
and Starling nearly fainted at that 
invitation, but Hawkins flashed 
them a reassuring grin. 

“I’m too busy for introductions, 
Hawkins. And why in hell do they 
look so shoddy? Have they had their 
physicals yet?” 

“And how!” Starling whispered 
to Filmore. 

“You know, General, that I 
wouldn’t send anyone up into space 
who wasn’t in perfect condition,” 
said Hawkins. 

“What did the flight doctor have 
to say?” 

“He said this group is in better 



shapes — uh, shape than aay he’s 
ever seen.” 

“Well, just as long as he’s check- 
ed them out.” Bullfat started to 
leave, then stopped at the door. “By 
the way, where are they bound for? 
Tycho Station?” 

“No, USSF 187.” 

“Is it time for rotation already?” 
“No, this group is additional per- 
sonnel.” 

“Additional personnel?” Bullfat 
yelled. “Hawkins, you know damn 
well that one eight-seven was built 
for exactly eighteen men rotated in 
groups of six every month. There is 
absolutely no room for twelve more 
people. What in hell do you expect 
your 'additional personnel’ to do — 
bunk in with the other men?” 

With a marvelous display of self- 
control, Hawkins managed to sup- 
press his laughter. The “additional 
personnel” smiled knowingly. Star- 
ling, however, had to run out of the 
room in a fit of hysterical giggling. 

“Where in hell is he going?” asked 
Bullfat, watching Starling exit. 

“Oh, he’s been under a lot of 
strain lately. He’s about due for a 
vacation.” 

“He looks more like he’s due for 
observation — and you, too, Haw- 
kins. You may control Space Agen- 
cy policy, but I control the launch- 
ings, and that crew is not going up 
as ‘additional personnel’ for any 
small space station. If you want to 
get them up there, you can rotate 
them six a month just like anybody 
else. That’s final.” Bullfat stalked 
triumphantly out the door. 

“Ready to give up, Jess?” Fil- 
more asked. 



m 



ir 




“Not in the least. Surprising, 
Bullfat had a good point there. If wc 
•ent the girls up to one eighty-seven, 
it really would be crowded. They’d 
be constantly getting in the men’s 
way, and it might be more nuisance 
than help. But all is not lost. When’s 
one ninety-three scheduled to go 
up?” 

“Next week — but surely you’re 
not thinking of sending the girls up 
in that.” 

“And why not?” 

“USSF 193 isn’t a passenger sta- 
tion — it’s for storing food and sup- 
plies. It’s not designed to be lived 
fai.” 

“So we improvise, Bill. One 
ninety-three is going to be {^aced in 
orbit parallel to one eighty-seven, 
because they’ll need it for stwage. 
Ifn be sent up in four already load- 
ed sections and assembled in space. 
It’s a simple enough matter in the 
course of a week to fit the sections 
up with acceleration couches and 
Kving quarters — just get rid of some 
of the non-essentials being shot 
and we’re all set. The girls can Kvc 
in there.’’ 

“It’s absurd, Jess,’’ Filmore mum- 
bled. 

“Not really. I’m growing rather 
fond of the idea.” Hawkins smiled 
B^tly. “Just think: USSF 193, your 
friendly neighborhood grocery store 
and callhouse all rolled into one.” 

Filmore groaned. The girls, car- 
ried away, cheered. 

iiT don’t believe it,” said Jerry 

X Blaine. “I mean, someone 
down there must be playing some 
kind of tricks.” 



“Nobody plays tricks in top-secret 
code,” Colonel Briston countered. 
“Jess Hawkins signed those orden 
himself. And you’ve just seen those 
girls with your own eyes. I admit 
it’s crazy — ” 

“Crazy? It’s wild, man,” said Phil 
Lewis. “Read (hose orders through 
again, will you, Mark. I’ve got to 
hear that nke little message one 
more time.” 

Briston diuckled. “Dear guys,” he 
read, “with each section of USSF 
193, you win be sent three pieces of 
equipment necessary for Project 
Cuddle-up (making a total of 
twelve). Your friendly Uncle Sam 
has spared no expense to bring them 
to you directly from Europe, so 
handle with care, huh? They’ll be 
rotated every six months or there^ 
abouts, but meanwhile they can be 
stored in USSF 193. Share them 
equally and have fun — that’s an 
order. Any communications concern- 
ing the equipment are to be address- 
ed to me personally in this same 
code. That, too, is an order. Yours 
sincerely, Jess Hawkins, Director, 
National Space Agency.” 

“Wowee!” Lewis exclaimed. “Re- 
mind me never to complain about 
paying taxes again.” 

Just then, Sydney emerged from 
the next room. She had removed her 
spacesuit and was clad very lightly. 
“Blimey,” she said, “you blokes 
sure keep a cold place around ’ere. 
Nanette and Constance and meself, 
we’re freezin’. We was wondering if 
any of you chaps would care to 
warm us up a mite.” 

By pulling rank. Colonel Briston 
managed to be first in line.

I t was very late at whai the station 
considered night, about a month 
after the girls had arrived. Lucette, 
Babette, Francette, Toillette, Viol- 
ctte. Rosette, Suzette, and Myrtle 
were out on call, while the rest were 
getting what sleep they could. Syd- 
ney was peacefully curled up in bed, 
dreaming the dreams of the not-so- 
innocent, when all of a sudden, a 
rock the size of a man’s fist ripped 
through the wall near her bed and 
banged against the wall on the far 
side. A hissing noise filled the room, 
and Sydney started gasping for 
breath as the air was sucked out of 
the hole made by the meteoroid. 

In a flash, she was out of her 
room and closing the air-tight com- 
partment door behind her. The three 
other girls rushed out into the hall- 
way to find out what was the mat- 
ter. “Blimey!” Sydney said when she 
got her breath back. “The damned 
thing’s sprung a leak!” . 

“Everything’s okay now, Sydney,” 
Jerry Blaine said as he came in from 
outside. “I got it all patched up. 
I’m afraid, though, that whatever 
you had loose in your room would 
have been sucked out into space. 
Nothing valuable, I hope.” 

“Not that I can think of,” Sydney 
told him. “But are you sure this 
won’t never ’appen again?” 

“Like I told you before, it was 
a once-in-a-billion fluke. It wouldn’t 
happen again in a thousand years.” 
“Oh, by the way,” Blaine called 
after her, “arc you booked for to- 
night? Good. I get off at about 
sixteen hundred — you can come 
over then.” 

“A woman’s work ain’t never 



done,” Sydney sighed wisely as she 
reentered her room. Most of her 
stuff was still in the bureau drawers, 
but search as she would, she couldn’t 
find the little pill bottle that she kept 
beside her bed. “Oh well,” she said, 
“I’ve managed without them before.” 

It was nearly four months, to be 
exact, when she decided that the sit- 
uation warranted her telling some- 
body, so she told Colonel Briston, 
who had just returned from three 
months Earthside. “My God!” was 
all he could say. 

“It ain’t as serious as all that.” 

“Not as serious as all that? You’re 
certainly taking it calmly. Why 
didn’t you tell anybody about this 
before?” 

“Well, it never ’appened to me be- 
fore.” 

Bristin gulped. 

“I think we’d better put in a cal! 
to that Mr. ’Awkins. ’E always seems 
to know what to do.” 

S en. McDermott: You were the 
one who discovered all these 
goings-on, weren’t you. General? 

Gen. Bullfat: You’re damn right 
I was. I’d suspected from the start 
that Hawkins had sent some girls 
up there, but the vSpace Force never 
acts without absolute proof. So I 
held back my suspicions, gathering 
up the evidence meticulously, wait- 
ing for the proper moment to take 
my findings to the President. 

Sen. McDermott: In other words, 
then, your discovery was based on 
a long, careful investigation? 

Gen. Bullfat: Exactly, Senator. 
That’s the way the military does 
things.

A s luck would have it, both Haw- 
kins and Starling were out to 
hinch when the call came in. Since 
it was labeled “urgent,” a man from 
the communications room took it 
right over to Hawkins’ office. The 
door was locked. 

General Bullfat, just then coming 
out of his office down the hall, 
found the messenger waiting in the 
corridor for Hawkins’ return. With 
typical Bullfat persuasion — and two 
hundred and fifty pounds wearing 
five stars can be a lot of persuasion 
— he convinced the man that an 
urgent communication could not 
wait on “the whims of a damned 
goldbricker like Hawkins.” 

Bullfat took the message into his 
office and opened it. He easily de- 
coded the little five-word note, and 
then stared at it for about a minute, 
eyes bulging. “Parks,” he snapped 
to his secretary over the intercom, 
“get me the President. No, on sec- 
ond thought, don’t bother — I’ll go 
see him myself.” 

He left his office just as Hawkins 
and his aide were returning from 
lunch. The general couldn’t decide 
whether to laugh triumphantly in 
Hawkins’ face or to harangue him, 
so all he said was, “I’ve got you 
now, Hawkins. At last I’ve got you.” 
Hawkins and Starling exchanged 
puzzled, worried glances. Entering 
the general’s office, Hawkins found 
the message on the desk, read it si- 
lently to himself, and sat down hard. 
His eyes gazed vacantly at the wall 
across from him, and the message 
dropped loosely from his limp hand. 
Starling picked it up and read aloud 
in disbelief. 



•“Sydney pregnant. What now? 
Briston.’” 

S en. McDermott: Ladies and gen- 
tlemen. Since yesterday, I have 
had occasion to communicate with 
the President, and we came to the 
conclusion that further investiga- 
tions along these lines appear to be 
fruitless. Therefore, I wish to ad- 
journ this hearing until further no- 
tice, and withhold publication of the 
official transcript until such time as 
is deemed appropriate for release to 
the public. That will be all. 

F ilmore managed to meet Haw- 
kins outside the building. “I 
think I detect your fine hand in this, 
Jess. How did you ever pull that one 
out of the fire?” 

“Well,” Hawkins explained, “since 
the public hasn’t heard about this 
affair yet, I simply made the Presi- 
dent realize that as long as he can’t 
get rid of us, he might as well get 
used to us.” 

“Why can’t he get rid of you?” 
“Because the Director of the Na- 
tional Space Agency is appointed for 
a six-year term, of which I still have 
four years left. And besides, only 
Congress has the authority to dis- 
miss me.” 

“But what about the girls? Can’t

“Heavens, no! As civilian employ- 
ees of the Agency, they come under

LONCON n 
Or 

Through A Monocle? Darkly 

by ROBERT BLOCH 



T he last man in the World Science 
Fiction Convention sat alone 
in a room. 

Somebody knocked on the door . 
As a matter of fact, it was the 
bellboy, bringing me this beat-up 
typewriter so that I could write this 
beat-up report on the Loncon II, the 
23rd World Science Fiction Con- 
vention, which was held — in a grip 
of iron — over the last weekend in 
August, 1965. 

Those of you who are not famil- 
iar with science-fiction conventions 
must be told that these gatherings 
are annual affairs, sponsored by fan 
groups in various cities, and attended 
by readers, collectors, writers, illu- 
strators, editors and publishers in the 
sf field. This year it was London’s 
turn to play host, at the Mount 
Royal Hotel — so named because it 
is not on a hill and the only royalty 
ever patronizing it are the king-sized 
spiders which scuttle down the dark 
corridors. Actually, the hotel was 
quite nice and I’m only joking — it’s 
a longtime tradition that Convention 
hotels are unfit for human habita- 
tion. This one boasted quite ade- 
quate accommodations, and both the 
manager and assistant manager were 
science-fiction fans — at least, before 
the Convention began. 



And like most attendees, I didn^ 
come to the hotel in search of lux- 
urious appointments. My appoint- 
ments, if any, were with fellow-fans 
and fellow-professionals. 

Having never been to England be- 
fore, I had high hopes of meeting 
some of the more prominent Britisb 
writers of science fiction — men like 
H. G. Wells and Arthur Conan 
Doyle. Unfortunately, they weren't 
at the bar when I arrived. 

But there were English writers 
present, in abundance; among the 
more abundant I noted Guest ol 
Honor Brian Aldiss, Arthur C. 
Clarke, John Wyndham, Ted Tubb, 
James White, Bob Shaw, John Brun- 
ner, Arthur Sellings, John Rack- 
ham, Ted Carnell — plus such fans 
and fan-pros as Ron Bennett, Wall 
Willis, and the legendary Walter SL 
Gillings. The only one I hoped tn 
meet and didn’t was Mandy Rice- 
Davis. 

The big surprise, however, was 
the number of American attendees. 
Forry Ackerman I expected to sco^ 
and Terry Carr who was brought 
over by the TBO'Tatlantic Fan Fund 
as a special guest. But I didn’t ex- 
pect to run into George O. Smith, 
Poul Anderson, Jack Williamson, 
Harry Harrison, Robert Silverberg, 



106 





Judith Merril, Donald A. Wollhcim, 
James Blish, John Campbell and the 
editor of this publication Fred PohL 
Even old-time sf-writer Mack Rey- 
nolds, an expatriate for thirteen 
years, turned up for the occasion. 
Add to this group approximately 
fifty American fans, including Ron 
Ellik, Richard Eney, Ted White, 
Dave Kyle, and a contingent com- 
ing to bid for the Tricon; mix and 
stir thoroughly with Ken Bulmer, 
Eric Bentcliffe, Arthur Thomson, 
and you have quite a convention 
roster. And 7 have done enough 
name-dropping to get me off the 
hook and down to the business of 
reporting on the actual proceedings. 

T he first actual proceeding was 
the traditional gathering of 
British fandom at the Globe pub on 
the night before the Con. American 
fan A1 Lewis and English fan Peter 
Mabey drove me there, and in the 
smoke-and-bloke-filled room I had 
my first-hand introduction to our 
British cousin, who taught me how 
to play darts. I was the dart board. 

The convention itself opened on 
Friday evening, manned — or, in 
some cases, womanned — by the able 
Con Committee: Ella Parker, Ethel 
Lindsay, James Groves, Keith Otter, 
Peter Mabey and George Scithers. 

The first event was the introduc- 
tion of some of the prominent at- 
tendees ... but I’ve just done that 
bit. 

Following the welcoming cere- 
monies, Harry Harrison took the 
platform — and the audience — with 
a wild address, involving the tossing 
of meat-pies and a challenge to the 



effect that the modern novel is dead 
unless it contains science-fiction ele- 
ments. A question period followed, 
and Judy Merril, John Campbell and 
Ted Tubbs took up the gauntlet, 
calling for more and better writing 
in the field. Then Harrison went off 
to eat meat-pies and the rest of us 
mingled at various social and anti- 
social events until the wee hours. 

Forry Ackerman spoke on films, 
followed by the panel “All Things 
to All Fen”. From that point on 
events moved briskly — during the 
next two days we were privileged to 
see two amateur sf films, hear John 
Brunner’s edifying “How To Get 
High Without Going Into Orbit”, 
attending auctions, visit the art show, 
catch platform glimpses of Mika 
Moorcock, Campbell, Merril, SB- 
verberg and others — while, down at 
the bar, the hospitality flowed freely. 

Saturday night’s Fancy Dress Par- 
ty brought out the monsters and 
monstresses in full force; there were 
many striking costumes and a num- 
ber of well-deserved prizes awarded. 
My own favorite was Karen Ander- 
son’s black and balefully beautiful 
devil. 

Sunday morning’s panel, “A Ro- 
bot in the Executive Suite”, was foL 
lowed by the traditional Banquet in 
early afternoon. Toastmaster Tom 
Boardman introduced Brian Aldiss, 
Terry Carr and Arthur C. Clarke, all 
of whom spoke wittily and coher- 
ently. They were followed by a 
Mystery Speaker, who turned out 
to be me — the mystery being why 
I was allowed to open my big 
mouth. 

Forry Ackerman then presented 



LONCON II 




the E. E. Evans **Big Heart” Award 
to Walter Ernsting, after which Bob 
Silverberg took over to present the 
Hugos. 

A gain, for the benefit of late- 
comers, a word of explanation. 
The Hugos — so-named in honor of 
Hugo Gernsback, pioneer sf editor 
and publisher — are annually award- 
ed to fans and pros for “best” ef- 
forts in various categories. I have 
fond memories of my own, which 
I won in 1959, pawned in 1960. 

This year, Hugos went to Buck 
and Juanita Coulson for the Best 
Fanzine — Yandro; to Schoenherras 
Best Artist; Analog took the Prozine 
prize; Gordon Dickson was judged 
to have written the Best Short Story 
— Soldier, Ask Not from Galaxy — 
and the award for Best Novel went 
to Fritz Leiber for The Wanderer, 
In the Drama category, the winner 
was Dr. Strangelove, and Peter 
Stone, author of the novel from 
which the film was derived, was on 
hand to accept the Hugo. Betty Bal- 
lantine accepted the Best Publisher 
Award for Ballantine Books. 

English artist Eddie Jones was 
meanwhile piling up awards for his 
entries in the Art Show, and while 
there were no honors voted them, 
the Con-Committee deserved some 
prize of their own for the hard work 
which served to keep the Convention 
rolling . 

Between panels Involving Messrs. 
Frederik Pohl, Jack Williamson, 
Poul Anderson, Donald Wollheim 
and others, a Monday business meet- 
ing resulted in a vote for the Tricon 
Group’s bid, which means that 



Qeveland win be the scene oi 1966’s 
Convention. 

By means of panels, talks, dis- 
cussions, question-periods and just 
plain gab-fests, it’s possible for the 
fans to make themselves — and 
their personal preferences — known 
to the professionals in the field. 

And it’s also possible, through 
such meetings, for fans to become 
pros. Many of those appearing in 
London as professionals — Silver- 
berg, Peter Phillips, Terry Carr, Ted 
White, to name only a few at ran- 
dom — attended their first gather- 
ings in the guise of fans. 

But to a veteran like myself, bot- 
tle-scarred by thirteen conventions, 
there are special rewards. Renewing 
acquaintances with the English fans 
and pros who attended American 
cons in the past, meeting up with 
people 1 met years ago and thous- 
ands of miles away, listening to 
news and views in the field, and 
just relaxing in the company of kin- 
dred spirits is more than enough. 

Opeaking of spirits, it’s time I had 
the bellhop cart the empties out 
of this room. It’s time I cleaned up 
and went back out into the so- 
called real world — which is ever so 
less warm and friendly than the 
unique momentary microcosm which 
^IT'created, for only four days each 
year, in the form of a Science Fic- 
tion Convention. 

Those of you who have attended 
know what I’m talking about. As for 
those who haven’t — 1966 is your 
opportunity to find out for your- 
selt firsthand. 

See you in Cleveland! END

IF ^ Short Story 



MERCURY 

by J. h/L McFADDEN 



She was alien to Earth, 
but she liked it here. 
The food was very good! 



M ercury was not her real name. 

She had never felt the need 
of a name. She was a clean, healthy 
carnivore shaped like an otter with 
pale, lemon-colored fur and a brain 
ill-equipped to cope with abstract 
ideas. Her kind were hunters, though 
the concept of hunting would imply 
considerably more difficulty than 
they usually encountered. They had 
evolved in a world without sentient 
competition and had achieved the 
enviable position of being just a 
little faster than everything that was 
good to eat. 

Mercury’s short, comfortable life 
had been interrupted in a perplexing 
way one bright afternoon by the 
appearance in the sky of an enor- 
mous, shining object. It was belch- 
ing fire and noise as it settled slow- 
ly to the ground, but having done 
that it remained immobile so long 



that Mercury lost interest and went 
looking for a meal. 

She loped lazily to the top of the 
nearest rise and looked around the 
rolling verdant countryside. A herd 
of plump grass-eaters was grazing in 
an open field about a mile away, 
one or two of the larger males oc- 
casionally raising an inquisitive nose 
to sniff the air. 

Mercury dropped to the base of 
an outcropping of rock and bunched 
her powerful body into a compact 
ball with hindquarters firmly im- 
planted against the rock. Her hard, 
transparent eyelids clicked shut as 
she took a deep breath and launched 
herself straight toward the herd. Al- 
most instantaneously a puff of dust 
appeared about a quarter of a mile 
from the herd where Mercury made 
a final correction and chose her pre- 
cise target 



109 



Two of the grass eaten reared, 
•quawling, tossing dieir heads to- 
ward their injured flanks and gal- 
loped awkwa^y away acron the 
valley. The rest looked around in 
mild dismay and then thundered 
senselesdy after. 

Half a mfle beyond, where Ae 
had come to rest, Mercury chewed 
her fresh meal ccmtentedly. She had 
managed to catch two of the grass- 
eaters so aligned that her sharp, 
forward pointed teeth had a&ced a 
steak neatly out of each rump on a 
single pass and she was not likely to 
be hungry again the rest of the day. 

Her victims were seldom perman- 
ently injured and usually never saw 
her. If she had been cursed with the 
necessity for philosophizing, she 
would have been hard put to decide 
whether she was a hunter or a para- 
site. In either event she was a suc- 
cessful one and having finished eat- 
ing she curled up around a full 
belly in the warm afternoon sun 
and went to sleep. 

S he never saw the dark opening 
gradually appear near the bot- 
tom of the huge shining object or 
the clumsy figures that crawled out 
so haltingly and came to stand silent- 
ly over her. She never even noticed 
the anesthetic sprayed carefully in 
front of her nose. She never knew 
how she came to wake up in a cage. 

She awoke groggy, but otherwise 
intact. She shook her head and star- 
ed at the two giants creeping langor- 
ously past. She circled the cage 
and discovered no way out. One of 
the giants began making a low rum- 
bling noise. 



awake,’* said Clark. "I was 
afraid I might have overdosed it.** 

*^Her, not it,” Shoenbrum correct- 
ed. •'You’ve been away from Earth 
so long you’ve forgotten there’re two 
kinds of almost everything.” 

••Look at her move! TTiis would 
have been a hard one to catch if 
we hadn’t stumbled onto her siesta. 
Fm glad she’s healthy.” Clark was 
the expedition’s veterinarian and lik- 
ed at least to start with a good 
animal. 

Shoenbrum, as a zoologist, was 
prone to collect specimens in aS 
stages of disrepair just so long as 
they were different. **l want to find 
her a mate tomorrow.” 

But Mercury was destined to soli- 
tude. 

Throughout the expedition’s stay, 
no other of her species was 
ever even sighted. Every mammal 
they found was possessed of blind- 
ing agility. Even the herbivores mov- 
ed at breackneck speed from one 
clump of grass to the next, although 
they did not appear to be particularly 
shy at the approach of man. 

To Clark’s chagrin nearly every 
specimen they took had one or two 
deep scars about the flank. Shoen- 
brum decided that the mammals of 
the planet had simply over-specializ- 
ed on speed and constantly injured 
themselves by running pell mell into 
things. 

He never actually saw this 
occur, but the circumstantial evi- 
dence was so obvious that during the 
trip back to Earth he wrote an in- 
teresting paper on this example of 
a dead end in evolutionary develop- 
ment. 



110 



IF 




T he morning after Mercury was 
caught she woke uncomfortably 
hungry. Her last meal had been 
somewhat larger than average, but 
she was used to eating twice a day. 
She heard the low rumble made by 
die torpid giants and presently one 
erf them dragged itself to the side 
of the cage carrying a small con- 
tainer. Ever so gradually it bent 
over and reached through the bars 
to place the container on the floor. 
Mercury walked over and examined 
the contents. It seemed to be a li- 
quid that smelled vaguely like meat, 
but Mercury decided she was not 
really that hungry and sat down to 
wait. 

She had never faced the problem 
of a food shortage before. All her 
life she had been surrounded with 
fresh meals whenever the need arose. 
She wondered what the giants tast- 
ed like. 

By afternoon she was almost 
ready to try the giant’s odd smelling 
liquid, but it had been removed. This 
time they brought a small rodent 
hobbled but wriggling, and with their 
usual leisurely movements pushed 
the small animal through the bars 
into the cage. It was tiresome being 
reduced to hor d’oeuvres of this sort, 
but at least it was fresh and after 
sniffing it from all sides she ate 
most of it. 

The days settled into a long, dull 
pattern. Mercury took lethargic 
walks around the cage from time to 
time. Once a day one of the giants 
crept up with another bite-size ro- 
dent which was food enough for the 
life of languorous lassitude she was 
leading now. Her forward-pointed 



teeth were awkward when she tried 
to use them on such a small an^ 
mal, but by proceeding slowly and 
methodically she managed to cope 
with the difficulty. The giants were 
around much of the time but too 
sluggish to hold her interest. 

“This beauty will be the biggest 
crowd pleaser the World Zoo’s had 
in years,” Shoenbrum said. “Wish 
we could have found' a male, too. 
Really interesting specimens that are 
harmless and easy to keep like this 
are hard to come by.” 

“I’ve never seen anything like 
her,” Clark agreed. “She moves 
around that cage like a streak of 
yellow lightning — and never slows 
down except to sleep. Those guinea 
pigs I feed her hardly have time to 
hit the floor before ihey completely 
disappear. Fd like to see what she 
looks like when there’s room to 
run.” 

“You will. What I have in mind 
is that exhibit display we worked up 
for the cheetahs — the one where 
they race two or three hundred feet 
after a piece of meat being dragged 
by a high speed winch. People can 
stand along the other side of the 
raised moat and more can see at 
once.” 

“Well, I’m glad we’re getting in 
tomorrow,” the veterinarian said. 
“I’m almost out of guinea pigs.” 

T he transfer was made in the 
middle of a weekday morning 
and the zoo had only a scattering 
of visitors. The area around Mer- 
cury’s new run was roped off to 
give her a chance to become ac- 
customed to the place without dis- 



MERCURY 



111 




tractions. Her cage was mounted on 
a heavy truck and driven inside the 
run before the door was opened. 

Mercury watched intently as the 
giant slowly lifted a languid paw and 
left it pointing in her direction. The 
low rumble she had come to expect 
on occasions like this began as the 
giant’s mouth opened and closed 
with maddening indolence. Another 
giant who had hauled himself labor- 
iously up on top of the cage slowly 
grasped the door and began to raise 
it almost imperceptably. 

She walked carefully around the 
cage examining the new countryside 
in all directions. She was at the 
bottom of a shallow valley with the 
land rising all around, and the 
scene was as full of food as the 
rolling hills of her home. She had 
not had anything but bony guinea 
pigs to eat for almost a month and 
was dying for a decent meal. By now 
the giant had the door almost half 
way open. 

The truck jolted like the carriage 
of a heavy artillery piece, and Mer- 
cury vanished. A half mile up the 
hill an Indian water buffalo crashed 
bellowing into the zoo fence tossing 
his head at the two-foot gash in his 
hindquarters. 

Three days later Mercury sprawled 
comfortably in the sun on a rounded 
boulder. She had worked her way 
leisurely through this crowded slow- 
motion world to these high moun- 
tains where there was room to move 
about. Several times a few of the 



languid giants seemed to direct thek 
dufl attention toward her, but if sha 
was not hungry she simply moved. 

I t was a time when her nature de- 
manded solitude. Hunting forays 
would be ever more restricted in tha 
weeks to come and she felt an an- 
cient need for the protective comfort 
of deserted places. The knife-edga 
balance of survival in her home hiUs 
took a severe toll of her kind when 
they were new-born and still awk- 
wardly slow. She knew without 
thought that her litter of twelve ta 
fifteen cubs had been carried al- 
most full term. At home only the 
two or three most active could have 
survived the cruel blessing of that 
early struggle for food. 

But here . 

Here the universe had almost stop- 
ped. Here even the slowest toddling 
white ball of fur need never know 
a day of hunger. The drumbeat of 
this nature was a funeral dirge. 

Mercury looked out across the 
green valley dotted here and there 
with some of the nearly stationary 
food-giants and their sluggish ma- 
chines. She watched two of them get 
out of one of the machines and 
make their tedious way arm in arm 
toward a small stream. Patiently she 
waited until they were aligned direct- 
ly in front of her and then, licking 
her chops, dropped to the base of 
the boulder. 

Mercury had found paradise.

Meanwhile Retief is being pursued by the Voions, trying to keep 
their arms shipments secret. He escapes with the help of a friendly 
Quopp, who assists him in disguising himself in the mandibles and 
chitinous body-plates of a typical Quopp. 

But the Quoppina ibemselves are not the only enemy Retief 
has to face, for he discovers that behind them — arming them, 
advising them, waiting to profit from their rebellion — the sinister 
forces of the Grooci are at work.

bet some of our more impulsive 
members started in on the chore of 
sawing the Voion up into convenient 
lengths, thereby panicking them into 
breaking out of the jam.” 

“Check-check!” a Phip agreed. 
"All-all scat-scat!” 

"And by now they’re scattered 



over a hundred square miles of 
jungle, with several thousand highly 
irritated Voion in pursuit. So modi 
for the grass-roots movement.” 
“Tief-tief!” A Phip buzzed in ex- 
dtedly from a reconnoitre of the 
nearby cover. ‘Thing-thing there- 
there!” 

Retief drew his sword. “What kind 
of thing, small stuff? A Voion left 
over from the party?” 

“Big-big, long-long, stilt-stilt!” 

“A stilter? Like me? Gertie, wait 
here!” Retief followed the Phip for 
a hundred yards, then paused, listen- 
ing. 

T here was a crackling in the un- 
derbrush. A heavy-shouldered 
biped stalked into view — an un- 
shaven Terran in a tattered coverall 
and scuffed boots, holding a heavy 
old-style power pistol gripped in one 
immense fist. 

“Hold it right there, Bug,” Big 
Leon growled in Tribal dialect. “I 
got a couple bones to pick with 
you.” 

Retief smiled behind the mask and 
put a hand up to lift the disguis- 
ing head-piece. 

“Keep the flippers out from the 
sides,” Leon growled in dialect. 
“And drop the sticker. Maybe you 
never saw one of these before — ” 
he gestured with the gun — “but 
it’ll blow a hole through you, tree 
and all.” 

Retief tossed the sword aside. 
Leon nodded. “Smart bug. Now, 
there’s just one thing I want out of 
you, wiggly-eyes. I hear there’s a 
native leader that’s popped up out 
here in the brush, organizing the

yokels.” He motioned at the spare- 
parts littered ground. **It looks like 
there was a little action here, not too 
many hours' back. I don’t know 
which side you were on, and I don’t 
care. Just tell me where to find that 
Bug leader — fast.” 

“Why?” Relief demanded. 

Leon frowned at him “For a Bug, 
you’ve got kind of a l inny voice. 
But to Hell with it. I v ant to ask 
him for help.” 

“What kind of help?” 

Leon drew a finger across his 
forehead like a windshield wiper, 
slung sweat from it. “Help in stay- 
ing alive,” he said. “There’s forty- 
six of us Terries over at Rum Jun- 
gle. Ikk’s got us surrounded with 
about half a million troops and he 
swears he’s going to eat us for 
breakfast.” 

“I see,” Relief nodded. “And 
you’d ask a Bug for help?” 

“We’ll take any help we can get,” 
Leon stated flatly. 

“What makes you think you can 
get it?” 

Leon grunted. “You got a point 
there. But let’s can the chatter. 
Where’ll I find this Tief-tief char- 
acter?” 

Relief folded his arms. “That’s 
what they call me,” he said. 

“Huh?” Leon’s mouth closed 
slowly. “Uh-huh,” he nodded. “It 
figures. The only Quopp on the 
planet 1 want to make pals with, and 
I stick a gun in his chestplates.” He 
bolstered the weapon. “Well, how 
about it?” 

“I’d like to help you,” Relief 
said. 

“Great. That’s settled, then. Call 



your army out of the bushes and 
let’s get rolling. Something tells me 
the Voion will hit us at dawn — " 

“As I was saying,” Retief inter- 
rupted, “I’d like to help you Terries, 
but unfortunately I seem to have 
misplaced my army.” 

Leon’s hand went to his gun. 
“What kind of a stall is this?” he 
grated. 

“My hundred seasoned veterans 
wandered off while I wasn’t look- 
ing,” Retief explained. 

“A hundred!” The big Terran 
burst out. “I heard you had half the 
Bugs on Quopp with you! 1 heard 
you were cutting Ikk’s troops into 
Christmas tree ornaments. I 
heard — ” 

“You heard wrong. The Feder- 
ated Tribes were a spark glimmering 
in the night. Now they’re not even 
that.” 

Big Leon let out a long breath. 
“So I had a little walk for nothing. 
Okay. I should have known better. 
Now all I’ve got to do is get back 
through the Voion lines so I can 
help the boys pick off as many of 
those jaspers as we can before they 
ride over us.” He half-turned away, 
then faced Retief again. “A hundred 
against an army, huh? Maybe you 
Bugs are all right — some of you.” 
He turned and was gone. 

R etief motioned a hovering Phip 
over. 

“No sight of any other stiller in 
the neighborhood?” 

“Not-not,” the Phip stated. 

“How each one of you fellows 
knows what all the other ones know 
beats me,” Retief said. “But that’s 



116 



IP 




a mystery I’ll have to investigate 
hto. Keep looking for her. She can’t 
have gotten far through this growth 
with a Voion behind every third 
dump of brush.” 

“Sure-sure, Tief-tief! Look-look!” 
the Phip squeaked and darted off. 

Retief pulled off his helmet, un- 
buckled the chest and back armor 
and laid it aside with a sigh of re- 
lief. He removed the leg coverings 
gingerly. There was a nasty blister 
above the ankle where the Voion 
jailer had plied his torch carelessly. 
Clad in the narrow-cut trousers and 
shirt he had retained when donning 
his disguise in Sopp’s shop, he stack- 
ed the armor together, tied it with 
a loop of wire wine vine, concealed 
it behind a bush, then made his way 
back to where he had left Gerthu- 
dion. 

“All right, let’s go, Gertie,” he 
called, coming up her port quarter. 
The Rhoon started nervously, tilted 
a foot-long ocular over her dorsal 
plates, then gave a rumbling growl, 
u right,” Retief soothed. 

“I’m wearing a disguise.” 

“You look like a Terry,” Gerthu- 
dion accused. 

“That’s right. It’s all part of an 
elaborate scheme Fm rapidly getting 
wrapped up in like King Tut.” 

“King Tut? Who’s he? vSounds like 
a Voion. Now royal they’ll declare 
themselves — ?” 

“Steady, girl. Just a literary allu- 
sion.” 

“But now, Tief-tief, what of dear 
Aunt Vulugulei? I long to seek her 
out, or her destroyers to rend!” 

“I’m afraid you Rhoon are on 
your own, Gertie. Those fighting 

RETIEF'S WAR 



tribes I told you about won’t be 
available to carry out their end of 
the war after all.” 

“No matter. Even now the Tri- 
bal host circle far to the west in a 
wide sweep, our enemies to spy. 
Then retribution will we take in fufl 
measure — allies or no.” 

“How long would it take them to 
get here?” 

“Many hours, Tief-tief — if their 
search they’d abandon to heed a 
call.” 

“Do you know where Rum Jun- 
gle is?” 

“Certainly — if by that you mean 
that clustering of huts yonder to the 
south, whence emanate curious odors 
of alien cookery with a disfavorable 
wind.” 

“That’s the place. I need a lift 
in there. And there’s another stilter 
up ahead; he’s wearing the same 
kind of disguise I am. We can gath- 
er him on the way.” 

“As you wish, Tief-tief,” Gerthu- 
dion said. 

“Gertie, now that the Federated 
Tribes are dispersed, I can’t hold 
you to our agreement. This is a 
dangerous trip I’m asking you to 
make. You might run into the whole 
Voion Air Force.” 

“Why then, I’ll know where to 
find the ghouls!” Gerthudion honk- 
ed. “Mount up, Retief! Fly where 
I will, that will I — and let the vil- 
lains beware!” 

“That’s the way to talk, Gertie!” 
Retief said. 

Retief climbed into position on 
the Rhoon’s back. “Now let’s go see 
if things at Rurn Jungle are as bad 
as reported — or worse.”

44T don’t get it,” Big Leon said 
X between clenched teeth. He 
was riding just behind Retief atop 
Gerthudion’s ribbed shoulder-plates. 
•How’d you get out here in the 
woods? How’d you spot me? And 
how in the name of the Big Worm 
4M you tame this man-eater? In 
forty years in the jungle I never — ” 
“You never tried,” Retief finished 
for him. 

Leon sounded surprised. “I guess 
I didn’t. Why would I?” 

“We’re sitting on one reason. I’ll 
go into the other answers later, 
when things quiet down.” 

Gerthudion’s rotors thumped rhy- 
thmically; wind whistled past Re- 
liefs head. A thousand feet below, 
Ae jungle was a gray-green blanket, 
touched with yellow light here and 
Acre where the afternoon sun reach- 
ed a tall treetop. 

“Hey, Retief!” Leon called above 
Ae whine of the slip-stream. “Has 
your friend here got a friend? We’ve 
got company.” 

Retief looked back, following Big 
Leon’s pointing arm. Half a mile 
behind, a Rhoon was rapidly over- 
hauling the laden Gerthudion. 

“Goblin at seven o’clock,” Retief 
called to her, “Anyone you know, 
Gertie?” 

The Rhoon lifted her massive 
head, then swung her body sideways 
— a trick she performed with only 
a slight lagging of forward motion. 

“That’s — but it couldn’t be! Not 
Aunt Vulugulei!” the great creature 
honked. At once she banked, swept 
in a tight curve back toward the 



trailing Rhoon, now dosing fast 
“Aunt Vulgy!” she trumpeted. 
“Where in Quopp have you been? 
I’ve been worrying myself into a 
premature moult!” 

The other Rhoon, a scant five 
hundred yards distant now, banked 
up suddenly and shot away, rising 
fast, its rotors whick-whicking loud- 
ly. Gerthudion swerved, causing her 
riders to grab for better holds as 
she gave chase. 

“Auntie! It’s me, Gerthudion! 
Wait!” The agitated flyer was beat- 
ing her rotors frantically as she fell 
behind the unladen Rhoon, a quar- 
ter of a mile ahead now and two 
hundred feet higher. Sunlight glinted 
on spinning rotors as the strange 
Rhoon tilted, swung in a tight curve, 
swept down at top speed on its pur- 
suer. 

“Duck!” Retief called. “It’s a 
zombie!” 

Y ellow light winked from a point 
behind the pouncing Rhoon’s 
head. The buzz of a power gun cut 
through the tumult of rushing air. 

There was a harsh rattle of sound 
from behind Retief. Blue light glar- 
ed and danced at close hand as a 
pencil-thin beam lanced out, picked 
out the attacking Rhoon’s left rotor, 
held on it as Gerthudion wheeled to 
the left, dropped like a stone, rock- 
ing violently in the air-blast as the 
enemy flyer shot past. 

“I nicked him,” Leon growled. 
“The range is too long for a hand- 
gun to do much damage.” 

“He’s got the same problems.” 
Retief leaned forward. “Gertie, I’m 
sorry about Aunt Vulugulei, but you

wee how it is. Try to get above him; 
he can’t fire through his rotors.** 
“I’ll try, Tief-Tief,” Gerthudion 
wailed. *To think that my own 
auntie — “ 

“It’s not your aunt any more, Ger- 
tie; just a sneaky little Voion getting 
a free ride.” 

Gerthudion’s rotors labored. “I 
can’t gain on her — or it,” she bawl- 
ed. “Not with this burden!” 

“Tell her not to try dumping us 
off,” Leon barked. “My gun is the 
only thing that’ll nail that jasper. 
Just get me in position!” 

The Voion-controlled Rhoon ca- 
daver was far above now, still climb- 
ing. Gerthudion, her rotors thump- 
ing hard, was losing ground. 

“He’ll drop on us again in a min- 
ute,” Retief said. “Gertie, as he gets 
within range, you’re going to have 
to go into a vertical bank to give 
Leon a clear shot.” 

“Vertical? I’ll fall like a stone 
from a frost-shattered peak!” 

“That’s the way it’s got to be. I’m 
afraid. Lead him down — and don’t 
flare out until we’re at tree-top level. 
If we give him time to think, it will 
dawn on him all he has to do is 
stay right over us and pour in the 
fire!” 

“I’ll try.” '!^e Rhoon was in posi- 
tion now, above and slightly offside 
to the right. It stopped then, moving 
in for an easy kill. Gerthudion held 
her course. Abruptly the enemy gun 
fired, a wide-angle beam ar extreme 
range that flicked across Retiefi: ex- 
posed face like a breath from a blast 
furnace. 

“Now!” Retief called. Instantly 
Gerthudion whipped up on her left 



nde, her rotors screaming in the 
sudden release of load. In the same 
moment Leon, his left arm clamped 
around Retief, lanced out with his 
narrow-beam weapon. A ^ot of ac- 
tinic light darted across the gray 
belly plates of the zombie, then 
found and held steady on the left 
rotor. 

The fire from above was back on 
target now, playing over Gerthu- 
dion’s exposed side-plates with an 
odor like hot iron. 

“Stay with that wide beam an- 
other ten seconds, and you’re a gone 
Bug,” Leon grated out. The Rhoon 
above dipped to one side now, feel- 
ing the sting of the blaster, but Leon 
followed, held the rotor in the beam 
while air shrieked up past him like 
a tornado. 

“Right myself now I must, or per- 
ish!” Gerthudion honked. “Which is 
it to be, Tief-tief?” 

“Pull out!” Retief grabbed for 
hand-holds as the great body shifted 
under him, surging upward with 
crushing pressure. The whirling 
vanes bit into air, hammering. Leon 
broke off his fire — 

44 T Tey, look!” The attacking 

-TA Rhoon had veered off at the 
last possible instant, gun still firing, 
now lazily, it rolled over, went into 
a violent tumble. Pieces flew. Then 
the zombie was gone against the 
darkness below. 

“I think you burned through his 
wiring,” Retief called. “Gertie, stay 
low now; it’s only another couple of 
miles.” 

“Low shall I stay, like it or no,” 
the Rhoon called. “I thought my

flmin armature, its windings I would 
Melt!” 

Relief felt the heat of the over- 
worked body scorching his legs. “If 
we meet another one in the air we’ve 
lad it.” 

“If far it is, we’re lost,” she 
wheezed. ‘Tm all but spent.” 

“There it is!” Leon pointed to a 
liny cluster of buildings against the 
sweep of jungle ahead, stringed by 
tilled fields. 

Gerthudion flew on, dropping ev- 
en lower, until she labored just 
above the high crowns of trees 
whose leaves glittered in her back- 
wash like rippling water. The forest 
ended abruptly, and she was swoop- 
ing across the fields that surrounded 
the trading town, packed solid now 
with Voion soldiery. 

“Look at ’em,” Leon called. “Jam- 
med in so tight they can’t even 
maneuver! If those Bugs knew any- 
thing about siege tactics, they’d have 
wiped us out the first night!” 

“Better try some evasive action,” 
Relief called. “They may have some 
big stuff down there.” 

Gerthudion groaned, complied 
sluggishly. 

“If they have, they’re holding it 
back,” Leon yelled behind him. “All 
they hit us with so far is a lot of 
talk, plenty of rocks and arrows and 
a few hand-guns.” 

Blasters winked below now, search- 
ing after the Rhoon. She threw her 
massive weight from one side to 
another, flying a twisting course to- 
ward the squatty palisade ahead and 
the cluster of low buildings behind 
k. 

Leon took careful aim, then pour- 



ed a long burst from his power gun 
into a Voion gun crew. There was 
a flicker, then a violent burst of pale 
ydlow light that puffed outward in 
a dingy smoke cloud. It faded quick- 
ly as fragments whistled past Ger- 
thudion’s head and clattered against 
her rotors. Then the giant flyer stag- 
gered over the wall in a billow of 
dust and slammed into the ground at 
the center of the wide central plaza 
of the town. Men appeared, running 
toward the Rhoon. 

“Hold your fire!” Big Leon bel- 
lowed. “It’s me — and Relief! This 
Rhoon’s tame! First bushwacker lays 
a hand on her’s got me to answer 
to!” 

T he embattled Terrans were all 
around now, gaping as Relief 
and Leon slid down from their 
places. 

“Jumping jinkberries, Leon! 
How’d you catch that critter?” 

“You sure it don’t bite?” 
“Thought you was one of them 
that’s been buzzing us all day.” 
“How about it, Leon? Did you 
find that Bug chief?” 

“Quiet, the lot of you!” Leon held 
up his hands. “The bug rebels are 
out of the picture. We’re on our 
own.” He motioned to Relief. “I 
picked up a recruit, name of Relief.” 
“Well, you’re just in time for the 
massacre. Mister,” someone greeted 
him. 

“Hey, Leon. What about this 
Rhoon of yours? Maybe it could air- 
lift us out of here.” 

“I’ll carry no burden this day,” 
the Rhoon gasped out. Her rotors 
sagged as she squatted, her massive

damage ... to my windings ... I 
fear Fve done . such burdens to 
bear ... the while I gamboled like 
a Phip . 

Leon said, “You did okay, Ger- 
tie. Just take it easy, girl.” He faced 
the crowd of forty unshaven, un- 
washed frontiersmen. “What’s been 
going on while I was gone?” 

“They hit us again just after First 
Eclipse,” said a wide, swarthy man 
with a low-slung pistol belt. “Same 
cUd business. Come at us in a 
straight frontal assault, whooping it 
up and shooting arrows. A couple 
Rhoon made passes, dropping leaf- 
lets and stones, but our guns — we 
still got three working — kept ’em at 
a safe altitude. We kept our heads 
down and peppered ’em and they 
pulled back before they hit the stock- 
ade. They been quiet since noon. But 
they’re up to something. Been work- 
ing since dawn on something.” 

Leon grunted. “After a while 
those bugs are going to figure out 
all they have to do is hit us from 
four sides at once and get a couple 
magnesium fires going against the 
walls — and we’ve had it.” 

“Their tactics are likely to im- 
prove suddenly,” Retief said. 
“There’s a Groaci military advisor 
in the area ahd I imagine he’ll take 
the troops in hand before many 
hours pass. In the meantime, we’d 
better start making some plans — ” 
“Some wills, you mean,” someone 
corrected. “They’ll flatten us like a 
tidal wave once they get rolling.” 
“Still, we don’t want to make it 
too easy for them. Leon, what have 
you got in the way of armament. 



other than those three guns I heard 
mentioned?” 

“My iron makes four; it’s got 
about half a diarge left. There’s a 
couple dozen heavy-duty hunting 
bows — some of the boys are pretty 
good with ’em. And I had Jerry 
trying to inker up a rig to drop a 
few thousand volts to the perimeter 
wall.” 

“I have it going, Leon,” Jerry 
called. “Don’t know how long it will 
last if they throw a big load on the 
line, though.” 

“We finished up the ditching while 
you was gone, Leon,” another man 
called. “If they get past the stock- 
ade, they’ll hit a six-foot trench. 
That ought to slow ’em down some.” 

“This is all just peanuts,” Leon 
said. “Sure, we’ll take a few hun- 
dred with us — but that won’t stop 
us from going.” 

“It will be dusk in another few 
hours,” Retief said. “I think we can 
count on a go-for-broke attack with 
General Hish calling the plays. Let’s 
see if we can’t arrange a suitable 
reception.” 

XVI 

F rom a top-floor room in a tower 
that formed one corner of the 
compound at Rum Jungle, Retief 
studied the ranks of the Voion that 
moved restlessly all across the half- 
mile of cleared ground. 

“Uh-huh, our Groaci military ex- 
pert is on the scene,” he said. “That 
formation’s not exactly a parade- 
ground effect, but it’s a long way 
from the mob we flew over on the 
way in.”

“It’s not that that gives me the 
willies,” said a thick-set man with 
a short blond beard. “It’s them 
damned Rhoon circling up there.” 
He motioned toward floating dots 
far overhead that indicated the pre- 
sence of a pair of the huge flyers. 

“If they knew Gertie’s crowd were 
out looking for them, they’d be a 
Kttle less carefree up there,” Retief 
commented. “But I’m afraid our 
aerial allies are combing the wrong 
stretch of sky.” 

A man hurried in, breathing hard. 
“Okay, Big Leon,” he said. “I guess 
that does it. We rigged the ropes 
and the tank-traps, and all the boys 
are posted vtp as high as they could 
get. Les’s got a good head o* steam 
up on both boilers, and — ” 

“All right. Shorty,” Leon said. 
“Just tell everybody to look sharp 
and don’t make a move before the 
signal goes 

“Get ready,” Retief said. “I think 
something’s starting down there 
now.” 

Barely visible in the dim light, the 
Voion were crowding back, opening 
narrow lanes through their ranks; 
bulky shapes were trundling forward 
along the paths thus formed, 

“Oh-oh. Looks like they got some 
kind of heavy equipment,” Shorty 
said apprehensively. 

“Nope. Not equipment; friends,” 
Leon stated. “Those big critters are 
Jackoo. I guess that cuts it. Those 
boys can steamroller right through 
the walls.” 

“Correction,” Retief said. “Six, 
two and even those Jackoo are zom- 
bies like the Rhoon.” 

“What do you mean?” 



Leon and the other man stared at 
Retief while he gave them a brief 
explanation of the Voion technique 
of installing an energy cell and a 
pilot in a dead Quoppina. 

“The drive mechanism and cir- 
cuitry are all there,” he concluded. 
“All they have to do is supply the 
power and the guidance.” 

“That’s far from simple,” Jerry 
said. “Ye gods, the technical knowl- 
edge that implies! Maybe we’ve been 
underestimating these Voion.” 

“I think the Groaci have a digit 
in the pie,” Retief said. 

“Groaci, huh?” Jerry nodded, 
looking worried. “It fits. They’re 
skillful surgeons as well as exporters 
of sophisticated electronic and mech- 
anical devices.” 

“How can they butt in here?” 
Shorty demanded. “I thought that 
kind of stuff was frowned on by the 
CDT.” 

“You have to get within frown- 
ing range first,” Retief pointed out. 
“They’ve done a good job of keep- 
ing under cover.” 

“Looks like they’re getting set to 
hit the wall, all right,” Leon said. 
“I count eight of ’em. The game’ll 
be over quicker’n I figured.” 

Retief studied the maneuvers be- 
low, dim in the pre-dawn light. 
“Maybe not,” he said. “See if you 
can get me seven volunteers and 
we’ll try to stretch it into extra inn- 
ings.” 

R etief waited, flattened against 
the wall of a one-story structure 
the back of which was no more than 
ten feet from the timber wall sur- 
rounding the compound.

IF 




“Get ready,” Shorty called from 
the roof above. “They’re rolling now. 
Boy, look at ’em come! Brace your- 
self. He’s gonna hit right — ” 

There was a thunderous smash 
and a section of wall six feet wide 
bowed and burst inward. Amid a 
hail of splinters, the dull magenta 
form of a two- ton Jackoo appeared. 
It was wobbling from the terrific 
force of the impact, but still coming 
on, veering past the corner of the 
structure half in its path, gathering 
speed again now as it plunged past 
Retief at a distance of six feet — 

He swung out behind the bulky 
shape, took three running steps, 
jumped and pulled himself up on 
the wide back — even broader than 
Fufu’s ponderous dimensions, he 
noted in passing. Directly before 
him there was a hollow chopped out 
behind the massive skull — the brain 
location in all Quoppina species. In 
it the narrow back of a Voion 
crouched, a heavy helmet of gray 
armor plate protecting his head. Re- 
tief braced himself, reached forward, 
hauled the driver bodily from his 
cockpit and propelled him over the 
prow. 

There was a heavy ker-blump! 
as the broad wheels slammed over 
the unfortunate Quoppina. Clinging 
to the now unguided zombie, Retief 
reached into the cockpit, flipped up 
a large lever dabbed with lumines- 
cent orange paint. The groan of the 
drive ceased instantly. The jugger- 
naut slowed, rolled to a stop a foot 
from the six-foot moat dug by the 
defenders. 

There was a confused shrilling be- 
hind. Retief turned to see the leaders 



of a column of Voion pressing 
through the broached wall. 

“Now!” shouted someone from a 
rooftop. 

At once a brilliant cascade of elec- 
tric blue sparks leaped across the 
packed mass of invaders struggling 
on high wheels across the shattered 
timbers. The two foremost members 
squalled, and shot fwward. Those 
behind also squalled but,' impeded by 
the uneven ground and the efforts of 
their fellows, failed to dart clear. 
The high voltage continued to flow 
— here leaping a gap to the accom- 
paniment of miniature lightnings, 
there bringing adjacent patches of 
Voion to red heat before welding 
them together. More Voion, coming 
up fast from the rear, joined the 
press. They found themselves in- 
stantly joined in the wild dance of 
arcing current and randomly stimu- 
lated nerves and gear trains. 

Retief returned to the task at 
hand. He flipped the back-up switch, 
hastily maneuvered the captured ram 
to face in the direction from which 
it had come. The two Voion who 
had leaped clear of the confusion 
dashed toward him, seeking refuge. 
Retief grabbed up the issue club 
dropped by the former operator in 
his hasty exit in time to slam the 
gun from the grip of one of them, 
knock the other spinning with a 
back-handed swipe to the head. 
Then he pushed the ‘go’ lever into

into the welded mass, slamming

a voice yeDed. 

Men darted quickly out to 
haul at the one-inch sted fines, 
stretching them across the gap three 
feet from ground level. Redef look- 
ed around. Across the compound, 
other dark gaps showed in the wall. 
Here and there lay the skimped 
form of a Voion. A «ng}e Jackoo 
bulked immol^e. 

“Six of ’em busted through," Big 
Leon’s vcnce said, coming up be- 
side Relief, breathing hard. "One 
got stuck in his own hole. Another 
one was damaged so bad we couldn’t 
get him going again. The boys sent 
the others back to spread joy ac- 
cording to plan." 

“Any casualties?” 

“Les got a busted arm; he was 
kind of slow knocking over a Bug 
that got through. That scheme of 
yours worked out neat, Relief." 

“It just slowed them a little. Let’s 
see how Gertie’s doing.” 

They walked across to where the 
big fl5^er still rested, her four legs 
sprawled, her eyes dull. 

“Gertie, they’ll make it through 
on the next try,” Relief said. “How 
are you feeling?” 

“Bad,” the Rhoon groaned. “My 
circuitry I’ve overloaded. A month’s 
nest-rest I’ll require to be myself 
again.” 

“No dice. You’re going to have 
to lift off in a few minutes or you’ll 



wind up being somebody else," Big 
Leon said. “Think you can do it?” 

Oerthudion lifted an eye to gaze 
distastefully across at the signs of 
the recent fray. “If I must, I must 
But m wait until the last, my pow- 
ers to recover.”

sion for you,” Relief said.

ed. "Can you do it?" 

"Tis no mean errand you des-

these dastards to forestall. Then Pi

“Thanks, Gertie. I’m sorry I got 
you into tWs.” 

“I came willingly,” she honked 
with a show of spirit. “Sorry am I 
my fellow Rhoon so far afield have 
flown, else a goodly number of the 
rascals we’d have disassembled for 
you.” She started her rotors with a 
groan and lifted off, a vast dark 
shadow flitting upward in the 
gloom, tilting away toward the dark 
wall of the jungle.

A1 rooftop. “There’s a bunch 
shaping up to hit the gap over 
here — and looks like there’s more 
of the same down the line at Jerry’s 
spot . .” 

Other calls rang from the spot- 
ters posted on the roofs. 

‘Trying to catch us off-balance,” 
Big Leon said. He turned and yelled 
up to Shorty, “Okay! You know the 



126 



IP 




I^an; don’t let yourselves get cut 
off!” He turned to Retief as they 
started for the buildings at a run. 
“That Groaci general’s spending 
lugs like half-credit chips in an all- 
■ight Zoop Palace.” 

“He’s getting them free,” Retief 
said. 

“Here they come!” Shorty’s voice 
was drowned in a shrill battle-cry 
as the lead elements of the new 
wave of Voion shot through the 
break in the stockade, coming fast 
along the path trodden out by the 
Jackoo. The first in line was a big 
fellow with gaudy tribal inlays. As 
he saw Retief and Leon, he veered 
toward them, raising a barbheaded 
spear. He struck the stretched 
cable and slammed to a stop, bent 
almost double — and was instantly 
engulfed by others as they charged 
in to collide from behind, with a 
sound like empty garbage cans fall- 
ing off a truck. 

“Sock it to ’em!” Les yelled from 
his vantage point in the corner 
tower. Again a display of fireworks 
sprang up as ten thousand volts 
surged through the strung cable. 

“The generators can’t take that 
load for long,” Big Leon yelled 
above the uproar of crackling cur- 
rent, screeching Voion and enthus- 
iastic human yells. 

There was a brief tremor under- 
foot. A vivid glare came from the 
direction of the power plant. Retief 
and Leon threw themselves flat as 
a dull boom rumbled across the 
compound, accented by the whine 
of shrapnel passing overhead. The 
^ow at the fence-line died. 

“Shorty!” Leon called. 



“He’s down,” a voice rang from 
the next post in line. 

Leon swore, jumped to his feet. 
“Fall back on the Post Office,” he 
yelled. “Pass the word!” He turned, 
ran for the building where Shorty 
had been posted. The Voion crowd- 
ed in the gap in the wall were 
shrilling and fighting to free them- 
selves — those who had survived the 
overload. A large specimen broke 
free and shot forward to cut Leon 
off. 

Retief reached him in time to 
lay a solid blow across the side of 
his head, then spiked his wheels 
with his own club. Ahead, Leon 
jumped, caught the caves, pulled 
himself up. A second Voion disen- 
tangled himself, and came thump- 
ing forward on a warped wheel, gun 
in hand. 

There was the crackle of a power 
gun from the upper window of the 
adjacent corner tower. The Voion’t 
head disappeared in a spatter of 
vaporized metallic-chitin as the dead 
chassis slammed on to crash against 
the wall. Leon reappeared, lowering 
the inert form of Shorty. Retief 
caught the wounded man and 

draped him over a shoulder as Leoa 
dropped down beside him. 

TTie big man shouted: “Let’s 

sprint! They’ll cut us off!” 

Half a dozen Voion wheeled 

around the corner of the next 

structure in line and charged the 
two Terrans. Retief pivoted aside 

from a blaster shot, clubbed the 

next Voion in line as shots burped 
from the tower. At his side, Leoft 
ducked under a swinging diib^

flipped him. Then they were through 
sprinting for the plank laid across 
the six-foot ditch. Leon spun, flip- 
ped the board into the trench. Shots 
scored the doorframe as they dived 
through it. 

“Close,” Leon panted. “How’s 
Shorty?” 

“Breathing.” Retief took the 
stairs three at a time, whirled into 
the room previously selected as a 
last-ditch stronghold, lowered the 
small man to the floor, then jumped 
to the window. 

Below, Voion were pouring into 
the compound — and stopping short 
at the moat barring their path. In 
it some dozens of their more im- 
petuous comrades were already 
trapped, floundering on broken 
wheels and waving frantic arms. 
More Voion pressed from behind, 
crowding those in front. Tlie rank 
lining the ditch was fighting now to 
pull back from the brink of disaster. 
But as Retief watched, one, then 
three more, then half a dozen to- 
gether went over, dropped with a 
smash as those behind pressed for- 
ward to share in the loot. 

4 4 'ghat’s one way to bridge it," 
A a man said beside Retief. 
More men were coming into the 
room behind him. Across the com- 
pound, Retief . saw two men drop 
from a roof, start across, change 
course as Voion blaster shots 
crackled near them. A power gun 
buzzed beside Retief, laying down 
a covering fire. 

“Everybody’s here but Sam and 
Square-deal Mac,” somebody yelled. 

“They’re okay so far,” the man 



beside Retief called. He fired again, 
nailed a Voion who had struggled 
across the Voion-filled moat. One 
of the two men stumbled, spun, fell 
on his back. The other slung him 
over his shoulders in a fireman’s 
carry and came on to disappear 
into the door below. 

“AH in,” somebody called. “But- 
ton her up!” 

There was a sound of heavy tim- 
bers falling as a previously prepared 
barricade dropped into position to 
block the door below. 

Somebody said, “Henry’s had it 
Steel splinter in the skull.” 

“How many we lose?” Leon de- 
manded. 

“Henry’s dead. Shorty don’t look 
good. Three more with medium bad 
blaster burns and couple bruised 
up.” 

“Pretty good,” somebody called. 
“We must of put a couple hundred 
of them devils out of commission 
just on that last go-round!” 

“Their turn comes next,” Les said 
from the window. “They’re across 
the ditch now.” 

The compound was rapidly fill- 
ing with Voion, pouring through 
the shattered wall and across the 
choked ditch. The late afternoon 
light was failing rapidly now. 

“They’ll fire the buitding next,” 
Retief said. “Leon, let’s get the 
best shooters at the windows and 
try to discourage them from get- 
ting in close.” 

Leon snapped orders. Men moved 
to firing positions, readying bows 
and power guns. 

“We’re down to three guns,” 
Leon said, “and not enough arrows 



128 



IF 




to make a fellow start any long 

books.” 

“We’ll make ’em count,” some- 
one growled. A bowstring twanged, 
then another. A blaster buzzed. Be- 
low, a group of Voion who had 
reached the embattled Post Office 
withdrew hastily, leaving three 
former comrades lying on their 
sides with their wheels spinning 
lazily. The enemy horde filled the 
compound now, formed up in a 
dense-packed ring around the Ter- 
ran-occupied tower. 

“The boys in the front rank 
are a little reluctant to grab the 
glory,” Retief commented. 

“But the boys behind won’t let 
•cm stop,” Big Leon grumbled. 
•Tt’s like fighting high tide.” 

The circle closed; arrows sped, 
slammed through armor with solid 
clunks, or glanced off a helmet or 
shoulder plate to fly high in the 
air. 

“Save the guns for the ones out 
front,” Leon called. “Watch for fire- 
makers.” 

Beside Retief, a man made a 
choked sound and fell backward, 
an arrow quivering high in his 
chest. Retief caught up his bow, 
nocked a bolt, took aim, picked off 
a Voion wheeling in fast firing a 
blaster. The gunner veered and 
crashed over on his side. 

“This is fun,” somebody called. 
“But it won’t buy us much. Look 
at them babies come!” 

“Hey, they shot some kind of 
fire-arrow over here,” a man yelled 
from across the wide room. It’s 
stuck in the wall and burning like 
a fused tube-lining!” 



T here were bright flares among 
the Voion ranks now, then 
streaks that arced up across the 
glowing sky, trailing white-hot em- 
bers. Most fell short, one or two 
of them landing among the front 
ranks of the attackers, but there 
were two solid thuds against the 
roof overhead. Acrid, chemjcal- 
smelling smoke was coiling in the 
windows from the first hit. 

“How about it, men? Do we stay 
in here and roast, or go out and 
take a few of ’em with us?” Leon 
roared. 

“Let’s go get those Jaspers!” 
someone called. There was a shout 
of agreement. Men were coughing 
now; there were more ominous 
thumps against walls and roof. A 
flaming arrow shot through a glass- 
less window, elicited yells as it 
slammed the wall opposite, scatter- 
ing burning globlets of magnesium. 
A man plucked it out, set it 
against his bowstring, and let fly; 
there were screams as it sank home 
against the chest of a big Voion 
almost directly below. Someone had 
the door open now. Smoke and 
sparks billowed in. Big Leon cup- 
ped his hands to his mouth to 
shout above the roar of fire and 
battle: 

“You boys at the windows stick 
till the rest of us are out; keep 
pouring it to ’em!” He turned, 
plunged out through the smoke. 

Retief waited with his bow drawn, 
the feathers just under his chin. 
Big Leon appeared below, behind 
the tumbled logs of the barricade. 
A Voion charged to meet him but 
intercepted Retiefs arrow instead. 



RETIEF^S WAR 



129 




Below Reties window the Voion 
were pressing close again, driven by 
the inexorable pressure of those be- 
hind. 

There were three fires burning 
briskly along Reliefs side of the 
wall now. He loosed an arrow, saw 
more Voion crowd in. One, hustled 
by his lellowi, fought helplessly, fell 
into a flame-spouting puddle of 
melted wood. He flared up in a 
bright green blaze, only to be 
smothered by others crushing in 
against him. From behind the bar- 
ricade, Leon and the other Terrans 
fired steacfily, building up a heap of 
casualties. Leon vaulted the barrier, 
climbed up on the stacked Voion, 
firing down into the press. Relief 
picked off a Voion with a gun, set 
another arrow, loosed it, another . 

“That does it,” a man called. 
“Out of ammo. Pm going down and 
see if I can’t get me a couple bare- 
handed.” He disappeared into the 
smoke, coughing. 

At the barricade, Leon was still 
firing, an arrow entangled in the 
sleeve of his leather jacket. Relief 
saw him throw the gun aside, jump 
down into the small clear space be- 
fore the tangle of downed Voion, 
laying about him with a Voion club. 

“I guess ifs all over,” the last of 
Reliefs fellow archers declared. “No 
more arrows. Reckon Pll go down 
and meet ’em in the open. Don’t 
much like the idea of frying up 
here.” 

“Hold it,” Relief said. “Look!” 

B eyond the palisade, a disturbance 
had broken out on the Voion 
left flank. A horde of vari-colored 



Quoppina had appeared from the 
jumble on that quarter, and were 
rapidly cutting their way through 
toward the palisade. They were led 
by a wedge of Jackoo, one of which 
was larger than its fellows and car- 
ried a vari-colored Quoppina astride 
its back. 

Close behind a fast - moving 
column of blue-green fighters fol- 
lowed, their fighting claws snapping 
left and right. Behind them, a de- 
tachment of yellow-orange warriors 
were swinging bright-edged scythes 
as they mowed a path through the 
Voion ranks. 

Small purple shadows appeared 
among the trees. They began casting 
ropes which plucked targets from 
the fleeing Voion rabble to dangle, 
arms windmilling, above their fel- 
lows. 

“Hey! That must be that rebel 
army,” the bowman yelled. “Look 
at ’em come!” 

Down below, the clear space be- 
fore Big Leon was wider now. All 
across the compound breaks in the 
Voion ranks were opening. At the 
walls, Voion backs were visible as 
the confused attackers crowded out 
through the ragged gaps broached 
by the Jackoo zombies to confront 
the new threat, before which their 
fellows were streaming away in dis- 
order. 

The live Jackoo vanguard rumbled 
onward, cutting a swathe toward the 
embattled stockade. The vari-colored 
Quoppina rider who led them whirl- 
ed a flashing blade above a bright 
red Voion-like head. A small or- 
ganized group of Voion, barred their 
path, led by a small officer with 



130 



IF 




wdbbfy wheels. They stood their 
ground for half a minute, then 
broke and fled. Leon’s men were 
across the barricade now, firing at 
retreating backs, jumping huddled 
dead and wounded to get clear shots 
at die confused enemy. 

*Tt*s a blooming miracle!” a man 
shouted. 

“That must be them guerrilla 
fighters we heard about!” someone 
cafled. ”Yippee!” 

Retief left the window, went 
down through the churning smoke 
and emerged in the front entry hall 
where two Terrans lay on their backs 
behind the barricade of logs. He 
cHmbed the latter, clambered across 
fallen Voion and jumped down to 
stand beside Leon, who was bleed- 
ing from a cut across the cheek. 

“I guess that Bug leader just 
didn’t like my looks,” the big man 
said. “Look yonder!” 

The bright-colored Quoppina who 
bad led the charge jumped down 
from the Jackoo and stepped through 
the nearest gap in the wall — a tall 
creature with posterior arms well 
developed for walking, shorter upper 
members, rudimentary rotors above 
each shoulder, a bright red-orange 
face resembling a Voion with the 
exception of the color. 

“Yep,” Leon said. “That’s Tief- 
tief, all right. Come on. I guess we 
owe that Bug some thanks.” 

R etief studied the vari-colored 
stilter as it strode across the 
battle-littered ground. It carried a 
sword in hand, casually skirting the 
smoking bodies of electrocuted Voi- 
on, detouring around victims shot. 



iadna^aled or onshed in the dis- 
orderly scene just concluded. 

‘That was good timing,” Big Leon 
caUed in the Voion tribal dialect. 
•Tjlad you changed your mind.” 
The stilter came up, halted facing 
Retief and Leon, sheathed the sword. 
“My grasp of the Voion tongue is 
rather limited,” the Quoppina said 
in clear, accentless Terran, look- 
ing around at the shambles. “It 
seems you gentlemen have been 
busy.” 

I^on grunted. “We’ll be busy 
again if those Bugs decide to turn 
around and come back. How many 
troops you say you’ve got?” 

“I haven’t counted lately,” the 
stilter said coolly. “However, they’re 
rallying to the colors in satisfying 
numbers.” One armored manipula- 
tive member waved. “Are you in 
command of this death-trap?” 

Leon frowned. “Me and Retief 
been making most of the decisions,” 
he said flatly. “I’m no general, if 
that’s what you mean.” 

“Retief?” The stilter’s oculars 
swiveled. “Which one is he?” 

Leon jerked a thumb at him. 
“You called this place a death-trap,” 
he started. “What—” 

“Later,” the biped said quickly, 
looking at Retief. “I thought — I 
understood he was a diplomat . .” 
Retief said, “There are times when 
the wiliest diplomacy seems inade- 
quate. This appeared to be one of 
them.” 

“I’d like to speak to you — in 
private,” the stilter said, sounding 
breathless. 

“Hey, Retief! Better watch this 
character.” 



RETIEF S WAR 



131 




“It’s all right, Leon,” Retief said. 
He indicated an unciowded spot a 
few feet distant. The stilter stepped 
to it, then went on, paused inside 
the doorway to a building the roof 
of which was burning briskly, turn- 
ed and faced Retief. The two upper 
arms went to the scarlet head, fum- 
bled for a moment — 

The mask lifted off, to reveal an 
oval face with wide blue eyes, a 
cascade of strawberry blonde hair 
and a brilliant smile. 

“Don’t . don’t you know me?” 
the girl almost wailed as Retief 
studied her approvingly. “I’m Fifi!” 
Retief shook his head slowly, 
“Sorry. And I do mean sorry.” 

“It’s been quite a few years,” the 
girl said appealingly, “but I thought.” 
“You couldn’t be over twenty- 
<me,” Retief said. “It would take 
more than twenty-one years to for- 
get that face.” 

The girl tossed her head, her eyes 
darkling. “Perhaps you’ll recall the 
name Fianna Glorian?” 

Retief ’s eyes widened. “You mean 
Utile Fifi...r 

The girl clamped her gauntletted 
hands together, eliciting a loud clang. 
“Cousin Jame — I thought I’d never 
find you!” 

XVIII 

C4T don’t get it,” Big Leon de- 
X clfired. “I turn my back for 
five minutes to see how the wound- 
ed are making out, and this Tief- 
tief character disappears back into 
the brush — and this little lady pops 
out of noplace!” 

“Not exactly noplace, Mr. Ca- 



racki,” Fifi corrected gentiy. “I was 
with the army,” 

“Yeah, you sure were. And how 
you got there beats me. I’ve lived 
out here forty years and it’s the first 
time — ” 

“I told you about the yacht 
crashing — ” 

“Sure — and then you bust out 
of a Voion jail and a couple Phips 
take you in hand — ” 

“The little green ones? They’re 
cute!” Fifi said. “They led us to the 
Herpp village, and told us about the 
rebel army — ” 

“Hey, Leon!” A bearded Terran 
came up, giving Fifi an admiring 
look. “Looks like they’re getting set 
for one more push before full dark. 
This time they’ll make it.” 

Leon growled, “The reinforce- 
ments are nice, but not enough. 
Them Bugs will be all over us like 
army ants in a few minutes. Sorry 
you had to get into this, young lady. 
Wish there was some way to smug- 
gle you out of here.” 

“Don’t fret, Mr. Carnacki,” Fifi 
said coolly. “I have a weapon.” She 
held up an efficient-looking short- 
sword. “I wouldn’t dream of missing 
the action.” 

“Hmmm. That looks like the one 
that Bug Tief-tief was carrying.” 
“He gave it to me.” 

Leon grunted, turned away to 
bark orders. Retief leaned close to 
Fifi. 

“You still haven’t told me how 
you managed to take over my army.” 
“After I got the other girls set- 
tled in the native village, the little 
Phip led me to your scaresuit,” Fifi 
whispered. “Of course, I didn’t know 



132 



IF 





whose it was, but I thought it would 
be a good disguise. As soon as I got 
it on, the Phips flew off buzzing 
like mad. The next thing I knew, 
there were Quoppina arriving from 
every direction. They seemed to ac- 
cept me as their general, and I just 
went along.” 

“You seemed to be playing the 
role to the hilt when I first caught 
sight of you, Fifi.” 

‘I’ve listened to enough war stor- 
ies to know a little tactics — which 
is more than can be said for the 
Voion.” 

A sharp hubbub broke out nearby. 

Retief stepped out to see Jik- 
jik, Tupper, several other Zilk and 
Ween, a pair of heavy Jackoo, half 
a dozen Herpp and a cluster of blue 
and white Clute and high-wheeled 



Slang, striking in lemon accented 
with orange polka dots. 

“Where our warchief?” Jik-jik 
shrilled. “I wants to see Tief-tief, 
and I means now!” 

“Steady, troops,” Retief soothed. 
“Here I am.” 

“What you mean, here I is?” Jik- 
jik yelped. “I looking for a fighting 
Quopp name of Tief-tief, not some 
foreign-type Terry!” 

“Shhh. Fm in disguise. Don’t give 
me away.” 

“Oh.” Jik-jik looked Retief over 
carefully. “Pretty good,” he said in 
a conspiratorial tone. “Almost fool- 
ed me.” 

“Is it you, Tief?” Tupper hooted. 
“I feared ye were dead, the way ye 
dropped out of sight.” 

“Just a tricky bit of under-cover 
work,” Retief assured the group. 



HETIEF'S WAR 



133 



“Things is got worse since we 
teen you last,” Jik-jik said. “Voion 
vsing new stuff on us!” 

“Them Voion throwing thunder- 
bolts now, for sure!” a Ween said. 
“Come nigh to melting my tail wheel 
down!” He displayed the two-inch 
coasted depending from the tip of 
his anterior segment. 

“Hoo! It melted half away!” Jik- 
jik looked at Retief. “What this 
mean, War-chief?” 

“It means the Federated Tribes 
tie in trouble,” be said. ‘The Voion 
are using guns.” 

“Where’d they get these whatcha- 
calhims, guns?” a Clute inquired. “I 
ain’t never heard of nothing like that 
before. Melt a fellow down before 
he gets in harpoon range.” 

T’m afraid there’s been some 
meddling in Quopp’s internal af- 
fairs,” Retief said. “After we’ve 
cured the Voion of their interest in 
governing the planet, we’ll have to 
reverse that trend.” He looked over 
the delegation. 

T see you’ve picked up a few re- 
cruits. How did you manage it?” 
“Well, Tief-tief,” Jik-jik announc- 
ed. “I got to thinking about my 
Uncle Lub-lub and some of them 
other Ween in the next village, so I 
bribed a Phip to scatter over there 
and invite ’em to join the party. 
Seem like word got around, because 
volunteers done been coming in all 
day. Them Voion sure is got a heap 
of folks riled up at ’em.” 

“Nice work, Jik-jik. You, too, 
Tupper.” 

“What about me?” Fufu demand- 
ed. “While I was out on patrol, I 
caught a nosey Voion creeping up 



on us and flattened him single- 
wheeled!” 

“Way I hear it, you was sneaking 
off the back way and run into the 
whole Voion army,” Fut-fut com- 
mented. “It scare you so bad you 
come rolling back fast!” 

“The idea! I’d just slipped away 
for a little solitary contemplation — ” 
“We’ll compose a suitable military 
history of the operation later,” Re- 
tief interposed. “We’ll put in all 
the things we wish weM done and 
leave out the embarrassing parts. 
For now, we’ll stick to practical po- 
litics.” 

“Ain’t nothing practical about the 
fix us in,” Jik-jik stated. “Us done 
cut our way right into a trap. They 
is got us outnumbered six of sixes 
to one or I is a Voob’s nephew.” 

“I resent that, you!” a small red- 
orange Quoppina said cockily, snap- 
ping a couple of medium-sized claws 
at the Ween. “We Voob— ” 

“Even you Voob can see they 
packed together out there like grubs 
in a brood-rack.” 

“Watch y’r language, ye Worm- 
less cannibal!” a Zilk grated. 

“No bickering,” Retief broke in. 
“Tonight we’re all Quoppina together 
— or tomorrow we’ll all be spare 
parts!” 

I t was full dark now. A pale glow 
in the South announced the im- 
minent appearance of Joop. A Phip, 
its tiny pale green running lights 
glowing, dropped in with rotors 
whining to settle on Relief’s out-

Jft-jik, who standing by with the 
oCher members of the General Staff 
— one each of the tribes now repre- 
Mted in the Federation, plus Leon, 
Pffi and Seymour. 

Redef swung up onto Fufu’s bade. 
*Teon, wait until our diversion has 
penetrated as far as the edge of the 
Jmgle. Then hit them with all the 
firepower we’ve got. With a little 
hid:, they might panic and pull out" 

"And if a Dink had rotors, he 
wouldn’t spin his wheels so much," 
a Slang muttered. 

“All right, you Quoppina in the 
commando party. Don’t do anything 
brave and don’t get captured," Re- 
lief directed. “Just stick to the plan 
and try to cause as much confusion 
as possible." 

“Let’s go,” a Flink mounted 
astride a Jackoo whined. “Already 
nervous prostitution I got." 

Pofu huffed and started forward, 
rolling over a mat of flattened Voi- 
on, bursting out through the broach- 
ed fence, sending Voion flying. 
Ahead, the suddenly aroused enemy 
were closing in, clubs waving. Here 
and there was the wink of a power 
gun, firing with wild inaccuracy. 

Retief crouched over Fufu’s neck, 
his sword held extended low on the 
right side. A Voion darted intp his 
path, raised a gun — and slammed 
back as the point took him under 
tihe chest plates. Another leveled a 
^ear, but jumped aside in the nick 
of time as Fufu thundered past and 
the others of the assault column fol- 
lowed close behind. 



"Those city wheels," Fufu snort- 
ed. “No good at an to this sort of 
thingl" 

A Voion dashed to firing position 
among the trees ahead, tiirew iq) his 
arms. He arced gracefuUy up into 
the air, paused and started a return 
swing, suspended by tiie neck from 
a length of purple rope. Another 
veered suddenly as a filmy net drop- 
ped to engulf him, then went head 
over wheels In a cloud of dead 
leaves, tripping a pair of comrades. 

“Those Flink arc a caution,” Fufu 
panted. “ShaH I head back o\A 
now?” 

“Affirmative. And look out to 
that big fellow with the harpoon!” 

Fufu honked and swerved as a 
long barb-headed spear shot past his 
head, clattered off his side. 

“Tief-tief, arc you all right?” he 
shouted. 

“Sure; nice dodging!" 

T he Jackoo curving back now 
racing through the trees for the 
shelter of the stockade. Behind him, 
Voion non-coms shrilled commands; 
a steady fire slashed after the re- 
treating heavyweights. Fufu shied as 
a beam flicked across his flank. 

“Yiiii!” He bucked wildly. “That

Retief looked back. A pack of 
Voion were in close pursuit. Lights 
winked as they fired at the run, 
keeping to the six-foot trail flattened 
by Fufu’s hasty passage. More Voion 
packed the way ahead. Fufu plough- 
ed into the press, dozing the hapless 
Planetary forces aside like Indian 
clubs — but more popped up to fin 
their places.

“rm getting . winded/* the 
heavy mount gasped bade over his 
shoulder “There are so many of 
them]” 

“Break it off, Fufu,” Retief came 
back. “Looks like we can’t make the 
stockade. We’ll take to the woods 
and harass their flanks!” 

“I’ll try. But . I’m almost . 
pooped.” 

“As soon as you hit the edge of 
the jungle, we’ll form up a defensive 
ring,” Retief called. He countered a 
swinging club in the grip of a Voion, 
ducked under a spear-thrust, leaned 
aside from the flare of a power gun. 
Behind him, the other Jackoo of the 
detachment were in similar straits, 
hemmed in from all sides by a 
crushing press of Voion. Those be- 
hind were forcing the front rank un- 
willingly under the flattening treads 
of the heavy creatures. 

“We’ll form a circle,” he shouted 
back to them. “Close spacing, and 
heads facing out! You Flink dis- 
mount and beat them off as long as 
you can!” 

A t the edge of the jungle Fufu 
wheezed to a halt. Bubu came 
alongside and wheeled to face the 
forward-surging enemy. The others 
quickly took up positions to com- 
plete the ring. 

The oncoming Voion met wild 
swings from the embattled Jackoos’ 
digging members, supported by vig- 
orous resistance from Flink-wielded 
clubs and spears that had been cap- 
tured from the Voion who had 
managed to evade Fufu’s shovel- 
tipped arms and blasted him with it, 
then downed another. A heap of 



damaged Voion grew around the 
tiny fortress. Now the Voion attack- 
ers were forced to scale a mound 
of casualties to fire down into the 
enclosure. 

Beside Retief, one Flink after an- 
other yelled, toppled backward, 
smoking from a hit. The few re- 
maining rebels had all captured gum 
by now. They fired steadily, birt 
nearly as inaccurately as the Voion. 
Retief picked off one attacker after 
another, while the weapon grew hot 
in his hand. Then it buzzed dole- 
fully and died. 

A Voion above him took aim. Re- 
tief threw the gun, saw it clang off 
the Voion’s armored head, knocking 
him backward — 

There was a sudden change in the 
quality of the sounds of conflict. A 
high, thin shriek cut through the 
squalling of the Voion and the crac- 
kle of gunfire and fiercely burning 
metallo-wood. Dust rose in swirls. 
A miniature tornado seemed to press 
at the crowded Voion then hurl them 
backward. 

Into the cleared patch thus creat- 
ed, something vast and dark slam- 
med down with the ground-shaking 
boom! of a falling cliff. 

In the stunned silence that fol- 
lowed, pieces rattled all around. As 
shrill Voion cries rang out, dust roll- 
ed away to show the pulverized re- 
mains of a Rhoon scattered across 
the field among windrows of felled 
Voion. A second huge dark shape 
appeared, beating across the scene 
of battle at low level, rotors ham- 
mering. The bright flash of a power 
gun winked above its lights. 

“That does it, Tief-tief,” Ozzl

gasped. **Who could lightning 
ftx>m the sky?” 

Something dropped from die 
Bhocm’s underside, slammed down 
among the Voion, bounced high, hit 
again, cutting a swathe through 
tanks sdll stunned by die crash ol 
the first of the giant creatures. 

“Ticf-tief!” a vast voice boomed, 
floating across the sky as the Rhoon 
Wted. ‘Tief-tiefr 

TJstcnl” Ozzl choked. ‘^He’s — 
he*8 calling you! What’s it mean?” 

Retief jumped up on Fufu’s broad 
back. All around, the Voion were 
breaking and fleeing now, while the 
steady crackle and bzzapp of power 
guns sounded from the vast dark 
riiadows hanging above on hammer- 
ing rotors. 

”It means the fight’s over!” Retief 
shouted above the hurricane. “It’s 
Gertie and her friends with rein- 
fm-cements from the city — and two 
hundred smuggled power pistols!” 

XIX 

A n hour later, in an unburned 
room of the battered Post Of- 
fice, Retief and his victorious allies 
sat around a wide table. They were 
sampling Terran trade rum, Bachus 
brandy and Quoppina Hellrose — 
all cut three to one to stretch. 

“Those blasters turned the trick, 
all right, Retief,” Leon said admir- 
ingly. “What sleeve did you have 
them up?” 

“Oh, they were stored convenient- 
ly in the Customs shed. I hoped we 
wouldn’t have to use them. But 
once the Voion started it, there 
wasn’t much choice.” 



“You’re a funny kind of diplo- 
mat, if you don’t mind my men- 
tioning it,” Seymour commented. “I 
mean, sending Gertie to collect con- 
traband guns so you could blast the 
government army. It was a neat 
move, don’t get me wrong! But 
vdiaf 11 Longspoon sa 3 f?” 

“Actually, Seymour, I hadn’t in- 
tended to tell him.” . 

“I hope all of you gentlemen will 
^sfday the most complete discre- 
tion,” Fifi said sweetly. “Otherwise, 
m come gunning for you person- 
afly.” 

“Retief did what he had to do,” 
Leon growled. “What good’s a dead 
diplomat?” 

“That’s a question we’d better not 
examine too closely,” Retief said. 
“And since we’re now in position 
to present the authorities with a 
fait accompli, I don’t think anyone 
will pursue it to its logical conclu- 
sion.” 

“You is got my guarantee,” Jik- 
jik announced. “TTie new Federated 
Tribes ain’t going ask no embar- 
rassing questions.” 

A Terran planter thrust his head 
into the room. “The Bugs — our 
Bugs, I mean — just brought in the 
Voion general. Ugly-looking little 
devil. What do you think we ought 
to do with him?” 

“Retief, you want to talk to this 
jasper?” Leon demanded. “Or should 
I just throw him back?” 

“Maybe I’d better have a word 
with him.” 

Retief and Fifi followed Leon 
along to the room where the cap- 
tive Voion huddled on splayed 
wheels, his drooping antennae ex-

pressive of profound dejection. One 
ocular twitched as he saw Relief. 

“Let me talk to him. Alone,” he 
squeaked in a weak voice. Relief 
nodded. Leon frowned at him. 

“Every time somebody gets you 
off to the side, funny things start 
happening. Relief. I’ve got an idea 
you’re not telling all you know.” 
“Just my diplomatic reflex, Leon. 
I’ll be with you in five minutes.” 
“Watch that bird. He may have 
a spare sticker under his inlay.” • 
As soon as the two Terrans had 
left, the Voion lifted off his head- 
piece to reveal the pale gray visage 
of General Hish. 

“To give you credit, Terry!” he 
hissed in Groaci. “To have sucked 
me in neatly with the pretense of 
disorganization!” 

“Don’t feel too badly, General. If 
you only knew how I labored over 
the timing — ” 

“To not forget the miserable 
quality of the troops under my 
command,” Hish added anxiously. 
“To wish the lot of them disassem- 
bled and exported!” He broke off. 
“But I tire you with these recrimi- 
nations,” he went on smoothly in 
Voion. “Now, as a fellow member 
of a foreign mission, I assume you’ll 
accord me the usual courtesies.” 
Relief looked thoughtful. “Let me 
see. As far as I can recall, the cour- 
tesies I received the last time I was 
a giiest of the Groaci were a bit 
irregular.” 

“Now, now, my dear Relief! We 
mustn’t hold grudges, eh? Just give 
me an escort to my heli and we’ll 
let bygones be bygones — ” 

“There are a few little points I’d 



like for you lo dear up for me 
first,” Relief said. “You can start 
by telling me what the Groad For- 
eign Office had in mind when it 
started arming the Voion.” 

Hish made a clicking noise indi- 
cating surprise. “But my dear chap! 
I thought it was common knowledge 
that it was your own Ambassador 
Longspoon who conceived the no- 
tion of supplying, ah, educational 
material?” 

“Terry power guns make a blue 
flash, Hish,” Relief said patiently. 
“Those of Groaci manufacture make 
yellow ones — even when they’re 
tricked out with plastic covers to 
look like Terry guns. It was one erf 
your flimsier deceptions.” 

“Speaking of deceptions,” Hish 
mused, “I feel sure your own clev- 
er impersonation will cause quite a 
stir among your troops, once it’i 
known. To say nothing of the reac- 
tion among your colleagues when 
they discover you’ve been leading an 
armed insurrection — and against 
your own CDT-supported faction.” 
“It might. If there were anyone 
alive who knew about it — and feh 
gabby,” Relief agreed. 

“I’m alive,” Hish pointed out. 
“And while ‘gabby* is not perhaps 
the word I would have employed — ” 
“There’s not much I can do about 
your gabbiness,” Relief cut in. “But 
as for you being alive — ” 

“Relief! You wouldn’t? Not a 
fellow alien! A fellow diplomat! A 
fellow illegal operator!” 

“Oh, I might,” Relief said. “Now, 
suppose you demonstrate that gab- 
biness you were boasting about a 
few seconds ago . .”

Av strictest confidence,’* Hirii 
croaked, mopping at his throat sac 
with a large green hanky. “If Am- 
bassador Schluh ever suspected — 
that is, if he knew of my profes- 
sional confidences — ” 

There was a scrape of feet out- 
side the door. Hish hastily donned 
his head as the yellow-bearded Ter- 
ran came into the room. “Hey, Mr. 
Retief,” he said. “There’s a fellow 
out here just made a sloppy landing 
in a heli. Says he’s from the Terry 
Embassy at Ixix. Leon says you 
better talk to him.’’ 

“Certainly,’’ Relief got to his feet. 
“Where is he?” 

“Right here.” The blond man 
motioned. A second figure appear- 
ed in the door — muddy, tattered, 
his clothing awry, his cheeks un- 
shaven. Leon, Fifi, Seymour and a 
crowd of others were behind him, 
“Retief!” Magnan gasped. “Then 
you — how — I thought — but nev- 
er mind. They let me go. That is, 
they sent me — Ikk sent me — ” 
“Maybe you’d better sit down and 
collect yourself, Mr. Magnan.” Re- 
tief put a hand under the First 
Secretary’s elbow and guided him 
to a chair. 

Magnap sank down. 

“He has them. All of us. The 
entire staff,” he choked. “From Am- 
bassador Longspoon — locked up in 
his own Chancery, mind you — 
down to the merest code clerk! And 
unless the Federated Tribes instant- 
ly lay down their arms, disband 
their army and release all prisoners, 
he’s going to hang them right after 
breakfast tomorrow!” 



44 A ]l I got to say it,” Seymoiv 
Jl\ announced, hitdmif up hk 
pants, “we ain*t about to give up 
what we won just to sava a bunck 
of CDT slickers from a necktia 
party. Serves ’em ri^t for diuna- 
ming up to them Voion.” 

“Retief didn’t adc you to,** Big 
Leon snapped. “Shut up, Seymour. 
Anyway, we didn’t win die fight — 
the Bugs did.” 

“But the sixty-one prisoners,” 
Magnan protested breathlessly. 
‘Twenty women!” 

“Longspoon ought to appreciate 
being strung up by his pals,” a man 
put in. “These Quopp tribesmen will 
sure do the job if the Voion don’t.” 
“It’s a tough deal,” Leon cut in. 
“But even if we went along, wc got 
no guarantee Ikk wouldn’t hang ’em 
anyway — and us alongside of ’em.” 
“I’m afraid doing business 
Ikk is out of the question,” Retief 
agreed. “The former Prime Min»- 
ter is one of those realistic souls who 
never let a matter of principle stand 
in the way of practical matters. Still, 
I think hanging the whole staff is a 
bit severe.” 

“He must be out of his mind,” 
someone said. “He’ll have a coujrfe 
squadrons of CDT Peace Enforcers 
in here before you can say Ja^ 
Dools!” 

“Ikk is an end-of-the-world type,” 
Retief said. “He’s not concerned 
about consequences. Not until they 
jump out and grab him by the back 
of the neck.” 

“I say let’s get the Bug army to- 
gether — ” 

“The Federated Tribes,” Retief 
corrected gently. 



RETIEPS WAR

“Yeah. Okay, the Federated 
Tribes. We march ’em straight 
tiirough to Ixix, with plenty of 
Rhoon cover, take over the town, 
kick out the Voion garrison, tell old 
Ikk to hang up his tool box and 
put in a call for a CDT Monitor.** 

“CDT Monitor, Hell,” Seymour 
growled. “What did the CDT ever 
do for Quopp except give the Voion 
big ideas?” 

“Gentlemen, it’s apparent that the 
next target for the Federation is the 
capital,” Retief said. “I want you 
to wait one day before starting, how- 
ever.” 

“Hell, let’s hit ’em now! Before 
they get a chance to pull themselves 
together.” 

“That ain’t likely — not with their 
general cooling his wheels here.” 
Seymour nodded toward Hish, sit- 
ting silently in a corner. 

“What you want us to wait for, 
ReMef?” Les demanded. 

“Don’t sound any dumber’n you 
got to,” Big Leon growled. “He 
needs a few hours to try to spring 
the Ambassador and his rappies be- 
fore Ikk strings ’em up.” He looked 
at Retief. “Seymour and me’ll go 
with you.” 

“Three Terries would be just a 
trifle too conspicuous in Ixix to- 
night,” Retief said. “But I think I’ll 
take our friend the general along 
for company.” 

Hish jumped as though stung by 
a Zinger. “Why me?” he whispered. 

“You’ll be my guide,” Retief said 
blandly. 

“How do you figure to make vour 
play?” 

“There are a few supplies I’ll 



need. Then I’ll have to go over to 
the Federation camp and talk to the 
local headmen,” Retief said. “We’ll 
work out something.” 

Leon looked at him with narrowed 
eyes. “There’s angles to this I’m not 
getting,” he said. “But that’s okay. 
I guess you know what you’re do- 
ing.” 

Fifi put a hand on his arm. “Jame 
— have you really got to go? But 
that’s a stupid question, isn’t it?” 
She managed a smile. Retief put a 
finger under her chin. 

“Better send out some Jackoo and 
an escort and get the girls in here 
to camp and ready to march. To- 
morrow night you’ll all be celebrat- 
ing with a big party aboard a Corps 
Transport.” 

“But we c-came to see your 

“You will,” Retief said. “I claim 
the first dance.” 

“Yeah,” Shorty said under his 
breath. “Let’s hope he’s got both 
feet on the floor when he gets it.”

W ith his Quoppina armor in an 
inconspicuous bundle under 
one arm and Hish, still in Voion 
trappings, trailing dismally, Retief 
followed a guiding Phip to the Ween 
encampment a mile from Rum Jun- 
gle. 

Startled veterans of the morning’s 
action jumped up, fighting claws 
ready, as he and Hish walked into 
the clearing around their main camp- 
fire. The Groaci was close on his 
heels now. Jik-jik came forward. 
“Well, if it ain’t a Terry,” he said. 
“It’s me — Tief-tief.”

IF 




“Oh. Well clanged if it ain’t. You 
look just like one, and they all looks 
•tike.” 

“Remember — I’m incognito,” Re- 
lief said. 

“Oh, uh, yeah,” Jik-jik made a 
fast recovery. “Well, Terry, just step 
on in and sit down. Just be a little 
bit careful one of the boys don’t get 
kind of curious and nip off a small 
bite.” 

“I’m poison,” Relief said loudly. 
“You get terrible belly cramps if 
you eat a Terry, and afterward your 
cuticula falls off in big patches.” He 
took a seat on a fallen log; Hish 
hovered close, looking nervously at 
the Ween fighting claws gleaming all 
around. “I have to get into town, 
Jik-jik,” Relief said. “I’m going to 
need some help from the tribes with 
what I have in mind.” 

R elief, once again clad in his 
bright-colored armor, scanned 
the ground below as the immense 
male Rhoon on which he rode beat 
its way southward in company with 
a dozen picked companions. 

To the left flew the steed of Gen- 
eral Hish, a mount specially equip- 
ped with a dummy cockpit astride 
which the terrified Groaci sat, a gay 
red scarf fluttering from his neck. 
“It looks as though the ground 
troops have rounded up most of the 
refugees from last night’s fiasco,” 
Relief called to his Rhoon. “I see 
a few small parties huddled together 
here and there, but no concentra- 
tions.” 

“Except the fifty thousand of the 
rascals who still behind the city’s 
towers hide,” the deep voice boom- 



ed. “My hope it is they’ll venture 
up, their stolen Rhoonish corpses to 
employ against us.” 

“I doubt if you’ll get your wish,” 
Relief said. “Gerthudion and her 
friends have pretty well cleared the 
skies, I think.” 

With the Rhoon carrying Hish a 
hundred yards in advance. Reliefs 
flyer descended steadily, passed over 
the port at five hundred feet, aim- 
ing for the rooftop helipad that 
crowned the Terr an Chancery Tow- 
er. 

“That gun crew down there is 
tracking us,” Relief said. “But 
they’re not quite sure enough to 
shoot.” 

“That’s but a trivial hazard, Tief- 
tief, compared with challenging the 
Blackwheel’s stronghold.” 

“Let’s hope Hish remembers his 
lines.” 

“The prospect of Lundelia’s rend- 
ing claws will him inspire to a flaw- 
less performance,” the Rhoon 
croaked. Ahead, the lead Rhoon 
settled in to the pad, Hish clinging 
to his saddle, his jaunty scarf flut- 
tering downward now in the air blast 
frorh Lundelia’s rotors. Two Voion 
posted on the roof rolled to meet 
him, guns in hand. 

Hish lowered himself awkwardly 
and cast a nervous glance at the 
looming head of his mount. His arms 
waved as he spoke to the police. He 
pointed to Relief’s Rhoon, now 
dropping in to light beside Lun- 
delia. The big flyer braked his ro- 
tors to a stop with a final whop- 
vfho^-woooppp of displaced air.

rn take him along to His Omni-

As Redef jumped down, Hish 
waved the power gun from whidi 
the energy cell had been removed. 
*Tm sure the Prime Minister will be 
interested in meeting the rebel chief- 
tain, Tief-tief,” he amplified. 

“So that's the bandit, eh?” One 
of the Voion rolled over, peering 
through the failing light of the sun, 
now a baleful spotlight behind flat 
purple clouds on the horizon. “He’s 
a queer-looking Qiiopp. How’d you 
snare him?” 

“I snatched him single-handed 
from under the noses of his com- 
patriots, killing dozens and injuring 
hundreds more,” Hish snapped in 
his breathy Groaci voice. “Now 
clear my path before I lose my 
temper and add you to the list of 
casualties.” 

“Okay, okay, don’t get huffy,” 
the guard said sullenly. He waved 
the pair toward the door. “For your 
sake I hope that’s the genuine arti- 
cle you've got there,” he muttered 
as Hish rolled awkwardly by on his 
prosthetic wheels. 

“Oh, I'm genuine,” Retief said. 
“You don’t think he’d lie to you?” 

I nside, Retief went ahead of Hish, 
glanced along the short hall, 
turned to Hish. 

“You're’ doing fine. General. Now 
don’t get excited and blow this next 
scene. It’s the climax of the morn- 
ing’s entertainment.” He took the 
gun, fitted the kick-stick back in the 
butt, slipped it into his concealed hip 
holster, then adjusted his face-mask. 
“How do I look?” 



”Likc an insomniac’s nightmare,” 
Hish whispered. “Let me go now, 
Retief! When you’re shot down for 
the idiot you are, it would be a pity 
if I were caught in the overkill.” 
“I’ll see that your passing won’t 
be accidental,” Retief reassured the 
Groaci. He checked to sec that the 
bulky pouch slung over his left hip 
was in place; its contents shifted with 
a dull clank of glass. 

“All right, Hish,” he said. “Let’s 
go down.” 

“How can I negotiate these stairs, 
wheeled as I am?” 

“No stalling. General. Just bump 
down the way the Voion do, not 
forgetting to use the hand rails.” 
Hish complied, grumbling. In the 
wide corridor one flight down, Voion 
sentries were posted at intervals. 
They turned cold oculars on the 
pair. 

“Sing pretty,” Retief said softly. 
“You there,” Hish keened at the 
nearest Voion. “Which are the 
chambers of His Omnivoracity?” 
“Who wants to know, wobbly- 
wheels?” the cop came back. “What’s 
this you’ve got in tow? A Terry- 
Quopp half-breed?” He made the 
scratchy sound that indicated Appre- 
ciation of One’s Own Wit. 

“What wandering cretin fertilized 
your tribal ovum racks just prior to 
your hatching?” Hish inquired 
pointedly. “But I waste time with 
these pleasantries. Show me the way 
to the Prime Minister or I’ll see to 
it your component parts are added 
to the bench stock in a front line 
reppo deppo.” 

“You will, eh? Who the Worm 
you think you are!”

Hish tapped his narrow, Voion- 
armored thorax with a homy, pseu- 
doclaw, eliciting a hollow clunk. “Is 
it possible you don’t know the in- 
signia of a general officer?” he 
hissed. 

“Uh — is that what you are?” the 
fellow hesitated. “I never saw one.” 

“That omission has now been 
rectified,” Hish announced. “Quick- 
ly now! This prisoner is the insur- 
gent Commander-in-Chief.” 

“Yeah?” The guard rolled closer. 
Others in hearing pricked up their 
auditory antennae, moving in to fol- 
low the conversation. 

‘To watch your step,” Retief said 
quietly in Groaci. “To remember 
Aat if I have to shoot, you’ll be in 
my line of fire.” 

“Stop!” Hish snapped hoarsely, 
waving back the curious Voion. 
•Ttesume your posts at once! Clear 
the way!” 

“Let’s have a look at this stilter,” 
a Voion shrilled. 

“Yeah, I’d like to get a piece of 
the Quopp that blew the wheels off 
a couple of former associates of 
mine!” 

“Let’s work him over!” 

Hish crowded back against Retief. 
“One step closer, and you die!” he 
choked., “I can assure you a gun 
is aimed at your vitals at this in- 
stant!” 

“I don’t see any guns.” 

“Let’s see if this stilter’s arms 
bend — ” 

T here was the crash of a door 
slamming wide, an ear-splitting 
•creech of Voion rage. The sentries 
whirled to see the oversized figure 



of Prime Minister Ikk, Jarweel 
feathers a-tremble with rage, con- 
fronting them, flanked by armed 
guards. 

“You pond-scum have the unmiti- 
gated insolence to conduct a free- 
for-all at my very door?” he shrill- 
ed. “I’ll have the organ-clusters off 
the lot of you! Niv! Kiiz! Shoot 
them down where they stand!” 

“Ah ... if I niight interject a 
word, Your Omnivoracity?” Hish 
raised a hand. “I hope you remem- 
ber me — General Hish? I just hap- 
pened along with my prisoner.” 
“Hish? Prisoner? What—” The 
irate leader clacked his jeweled palps 
with a sound like a popped paper 
bag, staring at the disguised Groaci. 
“You mentioned the name of, ah. 
General Hish.” 

“Ah — there was the matter of a 
suitable, er, cover identity.” 

“Cover?” Ikk rolled up, waving 
the chastened sentries aside. He star- 
ed closely at Hish. “Hmmm. Yes,” 
he muttered. “I see the joints now. 
Nice job. You look like a tribal 
reject with axle rickets and shorted 
windings, but I’d never have guess- 
ed .. .” He looked at Retief. “And 
you say this is a prisoner, Hish?” 
“This, my dear Ikk, is the leader 
of the rabble forces.” 

“What? Are you sure?” Ikk rolled 
quickly back, looking Retief up and 
down. “I heard he was a stiltcr . 
maroon cuticula . rudimentary 
rotcx^ ... by the Worm, it fits! 
How did you manage — but never 
mind! Bring him along!” He whirl- 
ed. His eye fell on the sentries hud- 
dled in a clump under the watchful 
oculars of the bodyguards.

“Send these good fellows along, ** 
he shrilled merrily. “Sec that they 
all get promotions. Nothing like a 
show of spirit, I always say. Shows 
morale’s up.” Buzzing a merry tune, 
the Voion leader led the way through 
the wide door into the Ambassador- 
ial office and took up his pose under 
the large portrait of himself hanging 
where the Corps Ensign had been 
on Retiefs last visit. 

“Now!” He rubbed his grasping 
members together, eliciting a sound 
effect reminiscent of a hacksaw cut- 
ting an oil-drum. “Let’s have a look 
at the dacoit who had the effrontery 
to imagine he could interfere with 
my plans!” 

“Ah, Ikk.” Hish made a fluttery 
gesture “There are aspects to the 
present situation I haven’t yet men- 
tioned.” 

“Well?” Ikk canted his oculars at 
the Groaci. “Mention them at once! 
Not that they can be of any im- 
portance, with this fellow in my 
hands. A capital piece of work, 
Hish! For this, I may allow you 
to . But we’ll go into that later.” 
“It’s rather private,” Hish whis- 
pered urgently. “If you wouldn’t 
mind sending these fellows along?” 
“Umph.” Ikk waved an arm at 
his bodyguards. “Get out, you two. 
And while you’re at it, tell Sergeant 
Uzz and his carpenters to hurry up 
with the ten-Terry gibbet. No need 
to wait until morning now.” 

The two Voion rolled silently to 
the door, closed it gently behind 
them. Ikk turned to Retief, making 
a clattering sound with his zygoma- 
tic plates indicative of Pleasure An- 
ticipated. 



“Now, criminal,” he purred. 
“What have you to say for your- 
self?” 

Retief lifted the holster flap, snap- 
ped out the power gun and leveled 
it at Ikk’s head. “I’ll let this open 
the conversation,” he said genially. 

XXI 

I kk crouched, slumped down over 
his outward-slanting wheels, his 
lower arms slack, his upper pair 
picking nervously at his chest inlays. 

“You!” he addressed Hish. “A 
traitor! I trusted you! I gave you 
full powers, listened to your coun- 
sels, turned over my army to youl 
And now this!” 

“Surprising how these matters 
sometimes turn out,” Hish agreed 
in his whispery voice. He had his 
headpiece off now and was smoking 
one of Ikk’s imported dopeslicks. 
“Of course, there was the little mat- 
ter of the assassins assigned to eli- 
minate me from the picture as soon 
as you had achieved your modest 
goals. But I concede that was to be 
expected.” 

Ikk’s oculars twitched. “Who, 
me?” he said dazedly. “Why . 

“Naturally, I eliminated them the 
first day. A small needle fired into 
their main armatures did the trick 
neatly.” 

There was a small sound at the 
door. It snapped wide and Ikk’s 
two bodyguards rolled quickly 
through, guns at the ready, flipped 
the door shut behind them. Ikk 
came to life then, dropped behind 
the platinum Ambassadorial desk as 
the two swiveled to face Hish. Be-

hind the Groaci, Retief held the gun 
steady against his hostage's back- 
plates. 

“Shoot them down, Kuz!” Ikk 
shrilled. “Blast them into atoms! 
Burn them where they stand; never 
mind about the rub . 

His voice faded off. He extended 
an ocular above table-top level and 
saw the two Voion standing, guns 
at their sides. 

“What’s this?” he shrilled. “I or- 
der you to shoot them at once!” 

“Please, my dear Ikk!” Hish ob- 
jected. “Those supersonic harmonics 
are giving me a splitting headache!” 

Ikk rose up, his palps working 
spasmodically. “But — but I sum- 
moned then! I pushed my secret 
button right here under my green 
and pink inlay!” 

“Of course. But naturally, your 
bodyguards are on my payroll. But 
don’t feel badly. After all, my bud- 
get—” 

“But^” Ikk waved his arms at 
the Voion. “You can’t mean it, fel- 
lows! Traitors to your own kind?” 

“They’re a couple of the chaps 
you ordered disassembled for for- 
getting to light your dope-stick,” 
Hish said. “I countermanded the or- 
der and planted them on you.” 

“Then at least let them shoot the 
stilter!” Ikk proposed. “Surely you 
and I can settle our little differ- 
ences — ” 

“The stilter has the drop on me, 
I’m afraid, Ikk. No, these two good 
lads will have to be locked in the 
W.C. Attend to it, will you? There’s 
a good fellow.” 

“You handled that properly, 
Hish,” Retief commended as 11^

rolled dejectedly back after snapping 
the lock behind his former adher- 
ents. “Now, Ikk, I think we’d better 
summon Ambassador Longspoon 
here to make the party complete.** 

I kk grumbled, pressed a button on 
the silver mounted call-box, 
snapped an order. Five minutes 
dragged past. There was a tap at 
the door. 

“You’ll know just how to handle 
this,” Retief suggested gently to Ikk. 

Ikk twitched his oculars. “Send 
the Terry inf” he snapped. “Alone!” 
The door opened cautiously. A 
sharp nose appeared past its edge, 
then an unshaven, receding chin, 
followed by the rest of the Terran 
Ambassador. He ducked his head 
at Ikk, shot a glance at Retief, and 
Hish, whose face was again con- 
cealed behind the Voion mask. He 
let the door click behind him, tug- 
ged at the upper set of chrome- 
plated lapels of his mauve after-mid- 
night extra-formal cutaway, incon- 
gruous in the early evening light 
that gleamed through the hexagonal 
window behind Ikk. 

“Ah . there you are, Mr. Prime 
Minister,” he said. “Er, ah . .” 
“Hish, tell him not to get in my 
line of fire,” Retief said in Tribal. 

Longspoon’s eyes settled on Re- 
tief, still fully armored, jumped to 
the disguised Groaci, then back to 
the Prime Minister. ‘Tm not sure 
I understand,” he said. 

“The person behind me is armed, 
my dear Archie,” Hish said. “I fear 
he, not our respected colleague the 
Prime Minister, controls the situa- 
tion.” 



Longspoon stared blankly at Re- 
lief, his close-set eyes taking in the 
maroon chest plates, the scarlet- 
dyed head, the pink rotors. 

“Who — who is he?” he managed. 

”He’s the Worm-doomed trouble- 
maker who’s had the effrontery to 
defeat my army,” Ikk snapped. “So 
much for visions of a Quopp united 
in Voionhood!” 

“And,” Hish put in quickly, 
“you’ll be astonished to learn that 
his name is . .” He paused as 
though remembering something. 

“Why, I know the bandit’s name.” 
Longspoon’s mouth clamped in an 
indignant expression. “As a diplo- 
mat, it’s my business to keep in 
touch with these folk movements. 
It’s, ah, Tough-tou^. Or Toof-toof 
or something of the sort.” 

“How clever of Your Excellency,” 
Hish murmured. 

“Now that the introductions are 
out of the way,” Retief said in 
Tribal, “we’d better be getting on 
with the night’s work. Ikk, I want 
the entire Embassy staff taken to the 
port and loaded aboard these for- 
eign freighters you’ve impounded, 
and permitted to lift. Meanwhile, 
we’ll use the hot line to Sector HQ 
to get a squadron of CDT Peace 
Enforcers headed out this way. I 
hope they arrive in time to salvage 
a few undamaged Voion for use as 
museum specimens.” 

“What’s he saying?” Longspoon 
pulled at his stiff vermillion collar, 
his mouth opening and closing as 
though he were pumping air over 
gills. 

“He demands that you and your 
•laff leave Quopp at once,” Ikk said.

iiTT^hat’s that? Leave Quopp?

*Tcn him you departed under du-

lawless criminals wielding illegal 
firearms.” 

“Firearms? Here on Quopp? But 
that’s . that’s — ” 

“A flagrant violation of Interplan- 
etary Law,” Hish whispered piously. 
“Shocking.” 

“Give the orders, Ikk,” Retief 
said. “I want the operation conclud- 
ed before Second Jooprise. If I have 
to sit here any longer with my fin- 
ger on the firing stud it may begiii 
to twitch involuntarily.” 

“What? What?” Longspoon wait- 
ed for a translation. 

“He threatens to kill me unless I 
do as he commands,” Ikk said. 
“Much as I regret seeing you de- 
part under such, ah, humiliating 
circumstances, Archie, I fear I’ve 
no choice. Still, after your dismissal 
from the Corps for gross derelic- 
tion of duty in permitting shipments 
of Terry-manufactured arms to the 
rebels — ” 

“I? Nonsense! There are no Ter- 
ran weapons on Quopp!” 

“Look at the gun even now being 
aimed at my Grand Cross of the Le- 
gion d’Cosme,” Ikk snapped. “I as- 
sume you know a Terran power pis- 
tol when it’s pointed at you.” 
Longspoon's face sagged. “A 
Browning Mark XXX,” he gasped. 

Hish canted an eye to look at 
Retief. Retief said nothing. 



“Still,” Ikk went on, “You can 
always write your memoirs. Under a 
pseudonym, of course, the name 
Longspoon having by then acquired 
a galaxy-wide taint.” 

“I’ll not go!” Longspoon’s Adam’s 
apple quivered with indignation. “I’ll 
stay here until this is covered up — 
or, rather, until I’m able to clarify 
the situation.” 

“Kindly advise the Ambassador 
that his good friend Ikk intends to 
hang him,” Retief instructed Hish. 

“Lies!” Ikk screeched in Terran. 
“All lies! Archie and I have sucked 
the sourbale of eternal chumship!” 
‘TU not stir an inch!” Longspoon 
quavered. “My mind is made up!” 
“Let’s have a little action, Ikk,” 
Retief ordered. “I can feel the first 
twitch coming on.” 

“You wouldn’t dare,” Ikk keened 
faintly. “My loyal troops would tear 
you wheel from wheel!” 

“But you won’t be here to see it.” 
Prodding Hish ahead of him, Retief 
went up to the desk, leaned on it, 
put the gun to Ikk’s central inlay. 
“Now,” he said. 

Behind him there was a rustle, a 
wheeze of effort — 

He stepped back, whirled in time 
to see a chair wielded by the Am- 
bassador an instant before it crash- 
ed down across his head. 

44 A Ikk purred, like a knife 
sawing through corn husks. 
“Our rabble-rouser is now in posi- 
tion to see matters in a new light!” 
He made rattling noises in tribute to 
the jest. 

Retief was strapped into the same 
chair with which Longspoon had

crowned him, many loops of stout 
cord restraining his arms. He held 
his head-piece half turned away from 
the lamp which had been placed to 
glare into his oculars. A pair of 
heavy-armed Voion interrogation 
specialists stood by, implements 
ready. Hish was parked in a corner, 
striving to appear inconspicuous. 

Longspoon, his lapels awry, hook- 
ed a finger under the rope knotted 
about his neck. 

“I ... I don’t understand. Your 
Omnivoracity,” he quavered, 
“What’s the nature of the ceremony 
I’m to take part in?” 

“I promised you’d be elevated to 
a high post,” Ikk snapped. “Silence, 
or we’ll settle for a small informal 
ritual' right here in your office!” 

He rolled over to confront Retief. 
“Who supplied the nuclear weapons 
with which you slaughtered my in- 
nocent, fun-loving, primitively armed 
freedom fighters? The Terrans, no 
doubt? A classic doublecross!” 

“The Terrans supplied nothing but 
big ideas,” Retief confided. “And 
you Voion got all of those.” 

“A claw-snap for their ideas.” 
Ikk clicked his claws in discharge 
of the obligation. “You imagine I 
intended to conduct the planet’s 
business with a cold Terran nose in 
all my dealings, carping at every 
trifling slumrclearance project that 
happened to involve the disassembly 
of a few thousand sub-Voion vil- 
lagers? Hah! Longspoon v^ry gen- 
erously supplied sufficient equip- 
ment to enable me to launch the 
Liberation. But his usefulness end- 
ed the day the black banner of 
United Voionhood went up over 



Ixix!” He turned back to Retief. 
“Now, you will at once supply full 
information on rebel troop disposi- 
tions, armaments, unit designa- 
tions — ” 

“Why ask him about troop dis- 
positions, Ikk?” one of the interro- 
gators asked. “Every Quopp on the 
planet’s headed this way. We won’t 
have any trouble finding them.” 
“It’s traditional,” Ikk snapped. 
“Now shut up and let me get on 
with this!” 

“I thought we were the interro- 
gators,” the other Voion said sul- 
lenly. “You stick to your Prime 
Ministering and let union labor do 
their job.” 

“Hmmmph. I hope the union will 
enter no objection if my good friend 
Hish assists with the chore in the 
capacity of technical advisor?” He 
canted an ocular at the disguised 
Groaci. “What techniques would 
you recommend as being the most 
fun as well as most effective?” 
“Who, I?” Hish stalled. “Why, 
wherever did you get such an idea?” 
‘To keep them occupied,” Retief 
said quickly in Groaci. “To remem- 
ber which side of the bread substi- 
tute has the ikky-wax on it.” 

“What’s that?” Ikk waggled his 
antennae alertly at Retief. “What 
did you say?” 

“Just invoking the Worm in her 
own language,” Retief clarified. 
“What language is that?” 
“Worman, of course.” 

“Oh, yes. Well, don’t do it any 
more!” 

“Ikk!” Hish exclaimed. “A most 
disturbing thought has just come 
to me!”

“Ah — er . I hardly know how

yourself to me immediately by ex- 
plaining what these hems and haws

“I was thinking . that is, I 
hadn’t thought ... I mean, have 
you happened to think . .** 

Ikk motioned his torturers over, 
warn you, Hish! You’ll tell me 
what this is all about at once, or I’ll 
give my union men a crack at some 
overtime!” 

As Hish engaged the Voion is 
conversation, Retief twisted his arm 
inside the fitted armor sheath and 
slipped his hand free of the gaunt- 
let. The confining rope fell away. He 
reached to the pouch still slung at 
his side, lifted the flap, took out a 
small jar of thick amber fluid. 

“Awwwwkk!” Ambassador Long- 
spoon pointed at him, eyes goggling. 
•*Help! It’s liquid smashite! He’ll 
blow us all to atoms!” 

Ikk and his troops spun on their 
wheels. One Voion scrabbled at a 
holster, as the jar hurtled through 
the air, smashed at his feet. A gold- 
en puddle spread across the rug in 
an aroma of pure Terran clover 
honey. 

There was a moment’s stunned si- 
lence. 

“Sh-shoot him!” Ikk managed. 
But the Voion with the gun drop- 
ped the weapon, dived for the fra- 
grant syrup. An instant later, both 



interrogators were jackknifed over 
the honey, quivering in ecstasy, their 
drinking organs buried in nectar a 
thousand times stronger than the 
most potent Hellrose. Ikk alone still 
resisted, his antennae vibrating like 
struck gongs. He groped, brought up 
a gun, wavered, dithered, then with 
a thin cry dropped it and dived for 
the irresistable honey. 

Retief shook the ropes from his 
arms, undid the straps and stood. 

“Well done, General,” he said. 
think that concluded this unfortun- 
ate incident in Quopp history. Now 
you and I had better have that little 
private chat you mentioned ear- 
lier .

I t was almost dawn. Ambassador 
Longspoon, freshly shaved and 
arrayed in a crisp breakfast-hour in- 
formal dickey in puce and ochre 
stripes, stared glumly across the 
width of his platinum desk at Retief, 
now back in mufti. Beside him, 
Colonel Underknuckle rattled a 
sheet of paper, cleared his throat, 
beetled his eyebrows. 

“The report indicates that after 
the accused was seen with the bomb 
— just before being reported absent 
without leave — a cursory inspection 
of his quarters revealed, among oth- 
er curiosities, the following: A doz- 
en pairs of hand-tooled polyon 
undergarments with the monogram 
‘L’, absent for some weeks from 
the wardrobe of Your Excellency; 
three cases of aged Pepsi from the 
Ambassadorial private stock; a vol- 
uminous secret correspondence with

TOnamed subversive elements; a 
number of reels of high-denomina- 
tion credit reported missing from 
the Budget and Fiscal Office; and 
a collection of racy photos of un- 
fertilized ova.” 

“Gracious,” Magnan murmured. 
“Did you find all those things your- 
self, Fred?” 

“Of course not,” the military at- 
tache snapped. “The Planetary 
Police turned them up.” 

“What*s that?” Longspoon frown- 
ed. “Considering subsequent events, 
I hardly think we can enter their 
findings as evidence. Let’s confine 
ourselves to the matter of the bomb, 
and the irregularities at the port. 
And of course, the AWOL.” 

“Hmmmph! Seems a pity to waste 
perfectly good evidence.” 

“Mr. Ambassador,” Magnan pip- 
ed. “I ’m sure it’s all just an un- 
fortunate misunderstanding. Perhaps 
Rctief wasn’t at the port at all . .” 

“Well?” Longspoon waited, eyes 
boring into Retief. 

“I was there,” Retief said mildly. 

“But — but, maybe it wasn’t really 
a bomb he had,” Magnan offered. 

“It was a bomb, all right,” Retief 
conceded. 

“Well, in that case,” Longspoon 
began. 

“Ah — gentlemen, if I may put 
in a word?” General Hish, minus his 
Voion trappings and dapper in a 
dun-colored hip-cloak and jeweled 
eye-shields, hitched his chair for- 
ward. “The bomb .. .ah ... it was, 
cr, that is to say, I, ah . 

“Yes, yes, get on with it. Gen- 
eral,” Longspoon snapped. “I’ve a 
number of othtf questions to ask 



you as soon as this distasteful busi- 
ness is cleared up.” 

“It was my bomb,” Hish whis- 
pered. 

ii^\Tour bomb?” Underknuckle 
I and Longspoon said in chor- 
us. 

“I, ah, had been led astray by evil 
companions,” Hish said, arranging 
his mandibles at angles indicative 
of deprecation. “That is, I had sup- 
plied the infernal machine to a 
group whom I understood intended 
to employ it to er, ah, carry out 
patriotic measures directed against 
reactionary elements. Little did I 
suspect that it was the Ter ran Em- 
bassy which was thus so ungener- 
ously characterized. At the last mo- 
ment, learning of the fell intent of 
these insidious schemers, I, um, ad- 
vised Mr. Retief of its where- 
abouts — ” 

“Heavens, nobly done!” Magnan 
gushed. “Gracious, and I always 
thought you Groaci had sort of a 
teentsy little prejudice against us 
Terrans.” 

“Ignoring for the moment the 
matter of Groaci interference in 
Quopp’s internal affairs,” Under- 
knuckle snorted, “there’s still the 
matter of the stolen publications! 
What about that, eh? Can’t wiggle 
out of this one, can you, by golly!” 

“Oh, I wanted to mention,” Mag- 
nan said. “Those bound volumes of 
the Pest Control Journal — ” 

“You didn’t say Pest Control 
Journal, did you, Magnan?” Long- 
spoon demanded. 

“Yes, indeed I did say Pest

•*What idiot shipped that particu- 
lu* periodical in here?” Longspoon 
bcOowed. “The entire journal’s dc- 
TOted to methods of anihilating ar- 
ttiropods with chitinous exoskeletoni 
and ventral ladder-type nervous sys- 
tems! If that sort of thing were ever 
released among the Quoppina — 
why, we’d be hailed as the greatest 
murderers since Attila the HungP 

“Hun,” Magnan corrected. 

“Well, I trust he was hung even- 
tually! And the same goes for the 
nincompoop who ordered the PCJT 

“Gee, Fred,” Magnan looked at 
Underknuckle. “Wasn’t it you 
who — ” 

“Well, so that’s taken care ot,** 
Underknuckle said briskly. 

“That seems to leave notfiing out- 
standing but the unauthorized ab- 
sence,” Longspoon commented. “We 
can deal with this charge at the 
local level, I think, Fred.” 

“Pity, in a way.” The attache 
blinked at Retief. “Fd intended to 
ship him out under guard for ex- 
amination by a Board of Interro- 
gators, after which he’d be stripped 
of rank in a most colorful cere- 
mony — ” 

The desk screen buzzed. “The 
Revolutionary Council is here to 
see you, Mr. Ambassador,” a vine- 
gary voice arinounced. 

“Show them in at once. Fester.” 
Longspoon arranged his features and 
faced the door expectantly. “I’ll just 
quickly establish my ascendancy 
over these fellows,” he explained. 
“May as well get matters off on the 
correct footing.” 

Magnan leaned toward Retief. “I 
love watching him work,” he mur- 



mured. “It only took him an instant 
to decide on Hearty Congratulation 
plus Alert Awareness of Irregulari- 
ties, and just the teeniest bit of 
Latent Severity, all tied together with 
a touch of Gracious Condescen- 
sion.” 

“A great technician,” Retief 
agreed. ‘Too bad you can’t tell , the 
result from Stunned Incredulity.” 
“Um. Still, die Quoppina won’t 
know the difference.” 

T he door opened. Fester appear- 
ed, ushering in the newly buff- 
ed figure of Jik-jik, his scarlet cuti- 
cula gleaming under multiple coats 
of wax, a new Jarweel feather bob- 
bing behind hk left rear antenna. 

Behind him was the tall figure of 
Tupper, similarly glorified. Ozzl fol- 
lowed, with half a dozen other re- 
presentatives of the victorious Fed- 
eration. 

“Ah, Mr. Tief-tief, I presume?” 
Longspoon rose, extended a hand. 
Jik-jik waved it off. 

“No thanks, not hungry. Besides, 
us is got a new rule: Greens for 
Grubs and Grown-ups. Allies is bet- 
ter than Entrees.” 

“What’s he saying?” Longspoon 
muttered. 

“He’s just explaining the Federa- 
tion’s new dietary arrangements,” 
Retief explained. 

“A food faddist, eh?” Longspoon 
nodded wisely. 

Jik-jik glanced about the room; 
his oculars settled on Retief. “Hey,” 
he said. “Ain’t you — 

“Still working under cover,” Re- 
tief said quickly. “Pretend you don’t 
know me.”

“Tell Mr. Tief-tief that Fm much

Longspoon instructed. “Still, Fll lis-

“Did you get the Terry females 
into the city safely?” Retief asked 
Ihe Ween. 

“Sure did, Tief-tief. They at the 
port, waiting for that Terry Peace 
Enforcer coming in this morning.” 
“What did he say?” Longspoon 
demanded. 

“He’ll examine your credentials 
presently, Mr. Ambassador, Mean- 
while, keep your manipulative mem- 
bers out of Quopp's affairs.” 

“He said that?” Longspoon’s face 
darkened. 

“Fm giving a free translation,” 
Retief explained. “Meanwhile, what 
about CDT recognition of the new 
regime?” 

“Recognition? Hmmm. There was 
the matter of a certain understand- 
ing with the Voion . .” 

“Shall I remind him of that?” 

“By no means! Tell him, ah, that 
I shall look forward to regularization 
of relations between our two peoples 
as soon as one or two points are 
ironed out. Now, we’ll want an un- 
derstanding on commercial matters. 
I think a thousand-man Trade Mis- 
sion would be just about right . ,” 
“Did you find the remains of the 
yacht the girls were in?” Retief in- 
quired of Jik-jik. 

“Uh-huh. Just like you say, Tief- 
tid. It blasted by some kind of big 
fire-gun. Big hole in the side.” 

R etief glanced at Hish, w'ho aimed 
his five eyes at different cor- 
ners of the room and began hum- 



ming the opening bars of You TeU 
Me Your Dream, VU Tell You 
Mine, 

“Well?” Longspoon barked. 

“He says there’s to be no Terry 
interference in Quopp’s tradition of 
free enterprise,” Retief advised the 
Ambassador. “And no more harass- 
ment of the traders at Rum Jungle 
and the other Market Towns.” 

“Eh? But what about the land 
reform program?” 

“There’ll be a big party tonight 
aboard the Terry ship,” Retief said 
to the delegates. “The Ambassador 
hopes you can make it.” 

“Nothing like a little socializing 
to take the boys* mind off the fun 
they missing not getting to loot the 
town,” Jik-jik said. “Us’ll be there 
for sure.” 

“The Federated Tribes will toler- 
ate no political intervention of any 
kind,” Retief relayed to Longspoon. 
“They specifically reject anything 
with the word ‘reform* in it.” 

“Gad! This fellow’s a reactionary 
of the worst stripe! Surely he won’t 
object to my Jungle Slum clearance 
plan, my Pretties for the Underpri- 
vileged Program and my Spiraling 
Price Support formula!” 

“I hope you followed my advice 
and disarmed the Voion instead of 
anihilating them,” Retief said to Jik- 
jik. 

“Head-chopping hard work,” the 
Ween agreed. “Us worked out a nice 
arrangement where one Voion as- 
signed to each village to keep the 
sanitary drains open. It working out 
good.” 

“They like the jungle the way it 
is,” Retief informed Longspoon.

“No one gets any privileges unless 
he can manage them for himself. 
And prices will be controlled by 
supply and demand.” 

“I see I’ve underrated this fel- 
low,” Longspoon muttered to his 
aides. “He’s obviously an exponent 
of some rather far-out economic 
theories.” He adjusted a smile ex- 
pressing the unspoken rapport exist- 
ing between Men of the World. 
‘Tell him that I’ve been considering 
the size of the development loan I’ll 
be prepared to recommend, and I’ve 
decided that the sum of, ah — ” he 
glanced at Magnan — “ten mil- 
lion?” 

‘Twenty,” Magnan murmured. 
“Per year,” he added. 

“Plus the military aid program,” 
Underknuckle put in. “I’d estimate 
a hundred-man Advisory Group — ” 

‘Twenty-five million per annum,” 
Longspoon said decisively. “With a 
cost-of-dying increase built in. Plus 
a sliding scale to compensate for 
seasonal fluctuations.” 

“Fluctuations in what?” Magnan 
asked alertly. 

“Anything that fluctuates, dam- 
mit!” the Ambassador snapped. 

Retief nodded solemnly. “Did you 
collect the guns?” he asked Jik-jik. 

Jik-jik wiggled his oculars uncom- 
fortably. “Uh, well, Tief-tief, it like 
this—” 

“Bury ’em, Jik-jik,” Retief said 
sternly “We agreed that firearms 
take all the fun out of fighting.” 

J ik-jik gave the soft squeal that 
was the Ween equivalent of a 
sigh. “Okay. I guess you right, Tief- 
tief. Me and Tupper here already 



done a little scrapping over what 
tribe get ’em. I guess I rather bury 
’em all than wind up looking down 
the barrel next time they a little 
inter-tribal rumble.” 

“What does he say?” Longspoon 
demanded. 

“No loan,” Retief translated. 

“Oh, he’s holding out for an out- 
right grant,” Longspoon rubbed his 
hands together. “Well, I think that 
could be arranged. Naturally, that 
will call for closer control. Say an 
additional staff of fifty — ” 

“No grants, either.” 

“See here!” Longspoon clamped 
his mouth. “If the fellow’s going to 
be unreasonable . .” 

“All he wants is a Monitor Service 
station in a quarter-million mile or- 
bit to ensure that no cargoes move 
between Groac and Quopp — in 
either direction.” 

General Hish made a choking 
sound. Colonel Underknuckle bright- 
ened. “That’s reasonable,” he stated. 
“Now, let me see. The station would 
fafl under my command, naturally. 
For a medium sized unit, say thirty 
men — ” 

“There’s one other thing,” Retief 
said. “Terran honey will have to be 
added to Narcotics Control’s list of 
excluded items as far as Quopp is 
concerned.” 

“Hmmph.” Longspoon eyed Jik- 
jik sourly. “I must say this chap is 
a shrewder negotiator than I’d an- 
ticipated. I can see we’re all going 
to have to tighten our belts and 
settle down to a long campaign be- 
fore we can bring Quopp to readi- 
ness for membership in the Free 
Liaison of Organized Planets.”

Magnan sniffed. “From whai I’ve 
seen of these confounded rebels — 
that is, of the freedom-loving stan- 
dard-bearers of the aroused popu- 
lace — they may never be ready for 
FLOP.” 

“Nonsense, Magnan! Just give us 
a few more sessions at the confer- 
ence table. They’ll come around. I 
may even take time to absorb the 
language — not that I don’t already 
have a good working knowledge of 
it,” he added. '‘You handled the in- 
terpretation fairly well, Relief, but 
you missed a few of the finer nu- 
ances.” 

“I thought the nuances were the 
best part,” Relief commented. 

“Maybe you’d better invite these 
fellows along to the Military Ball 
tonight,” Underknuckle announced. 
“After all, as the rebel leaders, we 
can consider them as honorary mili- 
tary men.” 

“By all means,” Longspoon said. 
“An excellent opportunity to make 
a few points; or rather, to imple- 
ment our sincere and heartfelt sense 
of solidarity with the forces of popu- 
lar aspiration.” 

“Oh, well put, Mr. Ambassador!” 
Magnan gasped. 

“It will be a gala affair,” Under- 
knuckle said. “A fitting conclusion 
to the excitement of the week, as 
well as a tribute to General Tief-tief 
and his gallant warriors of the Fed- 
erated Tribes.” He looked at Retief 
severely. “Tell ’em that; that’ll soft- 
en ’em up.” 

“Remember now,” Retief said to 
the callers. “No fighting at tonight’s 
big social event. Colonel Under- 
knuckle abhors violence.” 



“Okay, Tief-tief,** Jik-jik said. “By 
the way, we is heard they going to 
be some extra good stuff on hand.* 
He worked his oculars in a Quop- 
pina wink. “I hopes diat ain’t no 
mere rumor.” 

“I’ll personally spike the punch- 
bowl,” Retief assured him. He turn- 
ed to Underknuckle. “He wants to 
know if he should wear his medals.” 
“By all means!” Underknucklc 
boomed. “Full dress, medals and 
orders! A real military .occasion.” 
He gave Retief a cold eye. “As for 
yourself, sir — inasmuch as you’re 
under charges for AWOL, I suggest 
you consider yourself confined to 
quarters until further notice.” 

XXIII 

R etief and Jik-jik stood together 
at the arched entrance to the 
mirror-floored Grand Ballroom 
aboard the CDT Armed Monitor 
Vessel Expedient, watching the bril- 
liantly gowned and uniformed di- 
plomats of a dozen worlds gathered 
under the chandeliers to celebrate 
the new independence of Quopp. 

“Well, Tief-tief,” the Ween said. 
“Look like all the excitement over 
for a while. I going to miss it. Cut- 
ting greens not near as good exer- 
cise as snipping Voion down to 
size.” He sighed. “Us going to miss 
you, too, when you goes back to 
Stiltsville.” 

“You’ll find that fighting in de- 
fense of peace will absorb all your 
spare energy, mow that you’re civil- 
ized,” Retief reassured him. 

“I is a great believer in peaceful 
settlements,” Jik-jik assured him. 



154 



IF 




“Ain’t nobody as peaceful as a dead 
troublemaker.” 

“Just keep it within reason, or 
you’ll have the Terries on your 
neck. They tend to be spoil-sports 
when it comes to good old-fashioned 
massacres.” 

“Sound like a good tip. I’ll keep 
it in mind.” Jik-jik leaned close to 
Retief. “Beat me how that disguise 
of yours fool these Terries, even 
right up close. It ain’t that good.” 
“Let me know if it starts to slip.” 
Big Leon appeared, uncomfort- 
able in a brand-new black dress 
coverall and white tie. 

“Looks like old Longspoon learn- 
ed something while that rope was 
around his neck,” he said. “Seems 
like maybe us traders are going to 
get a square deal now.” 

“Most people are willing to give 
up their misconceptions,” Retief 
said. “Once they have them tattooed 
on their hide with a blunt instru- 
ment.” 

“Yeah. Uh.” Leon looked at Jfk- 
jik. “I guess I had a bunch of 
wrong ideas about you boys, too. 
You looked pretty good charging in 
out of the jungle yesterday.” 

“You Terries done heap up a 
big stack of arguments yourselves. 
Maybe us ought to work out some 
kind of mutual insistence agree- 
ment.” 

“Yeah. While we’re at it, why 
don’t you boys come around the 
store sometime? I got a line of lu- 
minous neckties coming in thatH 
tie knots in your oculars.” 

General Hish caught Retiefs eye; 
he strolled over to join the small 
Groaci, now resplendent in formal 



kit including a gold fringe that drag- 
ged the floor and three honorary 
head-bladders, one with fig-leai 
cluster. 

“Really, Retief, I think you went 
a bit far when you banned Groaci 
shipping from an entire volume of 
space,” Hish whispered. “I fear I 
shall have to insist on a rdaxatioa 
of the stricture, as well as c^tam 
other concessions in the field of, ail, 
minerals exploration.” 

A waiter offered drinks. FMi ac- 
cepted a clay pot of find: 
brandy. Retief lifted a slender-stem- 
med glass of pale pink fiquer. 
“Don’t confuse your terminotogy, 
Hish,” Retief said. 

“7 didn’t ban your arms-runners 
and smugglers. It was the wish of 
Tief-tief, remember?” 

“Come, come,” Hish hissed. “Out 
of regard for a colleague, I refrained 
from advising your Ambassador of 
die rather baroque role you played 
in the upsetting of his plans, but — ” 
‘Tsk, tsk, Hish. I thought we’d 
settled all this earlier.” 

“That was before you overplayed 
your hand in presuming to dictate 
the terms of fhe Terran-Quoppina 
accord,” Hish said crisply. “I think 
now that, all things considered — ” 
“Ah, but have all things been 
considered?” Retief sampled his 
drink, eyed the Groaci. 

“Your departure from the role of 
diplomat to lead the rebel forces was 
a trifling departure from protocol 
compared with deluding your Chief 
of Mission in his own sanctum 
sanctorum,” Hish pointed out. “Still, 
if you arrange matters to permit a

lew teams of Groad prospectors to 
pan a little gravd in tht interior, 
perhaps I’ll forget to mentkm the 
matter.” 

“I think you’d better suppress any 
impulses you may Itave in the direc- 
tion of overly candid disclosures,** 
Retief advised. **At least imtil after 
the Board of Inquiry into the mat- 
ter of the down^ yacht. The in- 
vestigation is being pressed ratha 
vigorously by His Imperial Majesty, 
Ronare the Ninth of Lily. It was bis 
yacht, you know.” 

“A great pity. But I fail to sec 
what — ” 

“It was just luck that the missile 
that hit the vessel failed to detonate 
and was found, nearly intact, wedg- 
ed in among what was left of the 
stern tubes.” 

“Retief! Have you . .?” 

“The shell is in the hands of the 
Federated Tribes. They can’t read 
Groaci, so they have no way of 
knowing who supplied it. Still, now 
that the evidence has been deposited 
in a safe place — ” 

“Blackmail?” Hish whispered ur- 
gently. “And after I risked my ex- 
istence to get you into Ikk’s office!” 
“The famous Groaci instinct for 
backing a winner was operating that 
day,” Retief said. “Now, I believe 



we agreed that nothing was to be 
gained by mentioning the unfortun- 
ate error that caused Groaci guns 
to be substituted for Terran propa- 
ganda.” 

*Tf you expose me. I’ll inform 
die Galaxy of your dastardly role 
in the affairP the Groaci hissed. 

’1 confess I might find that per- 
sonally embarrassing,” Retief said. 
“But my report will place all Groac 
in a very dim light.” 

“Not so loud!” Hish- warned, 
looking around. 

“But we still haven’t discussed 
the moral implications of your 
scheme to import from Quopp large 
volumes of parts for your justly 
famed transistorized Tri-D sets, 
mechanical egg-timers and electronic 
pleasure-center stimulators.” 

“But Quopp manufactures no 
such components,” Hish said weak- 

ly- 

“Now, we both know better than 
that, don’t we?” Retief reproved 
gently. “The Voion were to handle 
the harvesting, disassemble and sort 
the victims and deliver them to the 
port. And you were to pay them 
off in armaments. What the Voion 
didn’t know was that the entire 
scheme was merely a cover-up for 
something else.”

C4TV iTy dear Rctief, you’ve gotten 
-LVXa touch of the sun,” Hish 
whispered. “You’re raving!” 

“Once comfortably established, it 
would have been a simple matter to 
dispense with your Voion helpers 
and proceed to the real business at 
hand. Turning the whole planet into 
a breeding ground for a number of 
rather rare species of Quoppina in- 
habiting the central regions of the 
Deep Jungle.” 

“What a perfectly fantastic alle- 
gation!” Hish said breathlessly. 
“Why on Quopp would we Groaci 
go in for breeding aliens?” 

“Every creature on the planet as- 
similates metal into its makeup. Most 
of the varieties in this region use 
iron, copper, antimony, arsenic and 
so on. It just happens that there 
are a number of little-known tribes 
inhabiting the Deep Jungle on the 
other side of the planet who seques- 
ter silver, gold, uranium, platinum 
and traces of a few other useful 
materials.” 

“Really? Why, who would have 
thought it!” 

“You might have,” Retief said 
bluntly. “Inasmuch as 1 discovered 
specimens in your luggage.” 

“You searched my luggage?” 
Hish’s jeweled eyeshields almost fell 
off. 

“Certainly, You carelessly left it 
aboard the heli you used to pay 
your call at my camp just before I 
was forced to blow up the Voion 
officer’s field mess.” 

“I claim diplomatic immunity!” 
Hish croaked. “I demand the right 
to consult a lawyer!” 

“Don’t panic. I haven’t confided 



these matters in anyone yet. I 
thought you might want an oppor- 
tunity to smooth things over in a 
quieter way.” 

“But, my dear Retief, of course! 
Any little thing I can do — ” 
“Here!” a loud Terran voice said 
behind Retief. “I thought I confined 
you to your quarters, sir!” 

Retief turned. The portly figure 
of Colonel Underknuckle confronted 
him, the broad mud-colored lapels 
of his full-dress uniform sagging 
over his hollow chest, his shoulder 
boards drooping under the weight 
of gold braid. “You’ll leave this 
vessel at once and . and . .” 
His jaw sagged back against a 
cushion of fat, exposing inexpensive 
GI plates. His eyes goggled at Re- 
tief’s bronze-black uniform, the 
dragon rampant insignia of a Battle 
Commander worked in gold thread 
on the collar, the short cape of dark 
velvet, silver-lined, the rows of 
medals, orders, jeweled starbursts. 

“Here,” he said weakly. “What’s 
this? Impersonating an officer?” 

“I believe reservists are required 
to wear appropriate uniforms at a 
Military Ball,” Retief said. 

“A Battle Commander? A general 
officer? Impossible. You’re a civil- 
ian! An imposter! A fake!” 

4 4/^h, no, he’s quite genuine,” 
a mellow feminine voice 
said behind the colonel. 

He spun. A breath-taking girl in 
a silvery gown and a jeweled coro- 
net smiled at him. 

“And — and how would you 
know?” he blurted. 

“Because he holds his commis-

‘•Your world?” He blinked at her. 
“Here, aren’t you the person who 
ignore my order not to land here?” 
“My dear Colonel,” General Hish 
interjected, placing a limp Groad 
hand on Underknuckle’s arm. “Is it 
possible you don’t know? This young 
lady is Her Highness Princess Fian- 
na Glorian Deliciosa Hermione 
Arianne de Retief et du Lille.” 

“B — b — but I gave orders — ” 
“And I countermanded them, 
Colonel. I knew you’d understand.” 
She smiled radiantly. 

“And now. Colonel, I think you 
and General Hish would like to have 
a little chat,” Retief put in. “He 
wants to tell you all about his plans 
for a Groaci surgical and prosthetics 
mission to improve the lot of the 
Quoppina war wounded, past and 
future.” He looked at the Groaci. 
“Right, General?” 

“Quite correct, my dear Battle 
Commander,” Hish whispered in a 
resigned tone. “And the other mat- 
ters we were discussing?” 

“I’ve forgotten what they were.” 
“Ahh. To be sure. So have I, now 
that you mention it.” Hish moved 
off, whispering to Underknuckle. 
Retief turned to Fifi, inclined his 
head. 

“If I may crave the honor?” he

I this letter not to praise 

or criticize your mag'azine, but to 
■lerely express my own opinions. 
It has been a long time since I have 
written to a sf magazine, however 
I now feel the time has come. 

With the passing of time, there 
has been a steady decrease in sf 
magazines. Whereas once there were 
five and six magazines a fan could 
really get acquainted with, now 
there are only two or tiiree. Pore- 
'Tost among these two or three mag- 
izines is If. 

This leaves If with a responsibili- 
: to its audience. If not only has 
-he task of entertaining its readers 
with good stories, but it also has 
the duty of making the reader feel 
that If is Ais magazine. Unless I 
am mistaken, most readers like 
to feel that the magazine they are 
reading is aimed especially at them. 

As of right now, I feel that If 
is the only reader-oriented sf mag- 
azine. Not only do you run ex- 
cellent stories, but you also have 
a lively letter column. Perhaps 
the letter column and the editorials 
are the most important parts of 
your magazine. The stories you run 
often go on to hard-covers and 
paperbacks, but the departments 
are yours alone. 



I, for one, am in favor of book 
reviews. I am also in favor of an 
expanded letter column. In fact, 
7 favor anything which can bring If 
closer to its audience. 

You’ve reached a peak of ex- 
cellence in your fiction. How about 
working on the departments now? 
— Jim Armstrong, 6336 Holland 
St., Arvada, Colorado.

Dear Editor: 

Your editorial in the new If set 
me to thinking. I managed finally 
to compile a list of what I con- 
sidered the twenty best sf stories 
{Unknovm WorZdi-type fantasy I 
include in my definition of sf.) 
They are the following, in no par- 
ticular order. 

The Star by Arthur C. Clarke. 
The Piper's Son by Henry Kuttner. 
HeU Is Forever by Alfred Bester. 
Brave To Be A King by Poul An- 
derson. Alpha Ralpha Boulevard by 
Cordwainer Smith. A Work of Art 
by James Blish. Requi^ by Robert 
A. Heinlein. The Wind People by 
Marion Zimmer Bradley. Night- 
mare Brother by Alan E. Nourse. 
The Big Trek by Fritz Leiber. A 
Rose For Ecclesiastes by Roger 
Zelazny. Project Nursemaid by 
Judith Merril. The Golden Horn by 
Edgar Pangborn. A Gun For Din- 



IdO 





Maur by L. Spragrue deCamp. — 
And The Moon Be Still As Bright 
by Ray Bradbury. Saucer of Lone- 
Uness by Theodore Sturgeon. The 
Snowmen by Frederik Pohl. Road 
To Nightfall by Robert Silverberg. 
What* 8 It Like Out There? by Ed- 
mond Hamilton. Status Quo by 
Mack Reynolds. 

You were right about most of 
them being longer than the ordin- 
ary short story. But by my reckon- 
ing, only four of the above are 
short stories. (I took what you 
said to exclude novels of serial 
length.) 

The upcoming If sounds good 
indeed. I want to see more Retief, 
Gree, Fred Saberhagen's Berserk- 
er yarns, a Heinlein serial, Harry 
Harrison. (P. Schuyler Miller, in 
reviewing the anthology Judith 
Merril’s Project Nursemaid was 
in, said he hoped the story was 
only a prologue to a full-length 
novel about the children growing 
up on the project. I hope so too 
and I think it’d be a good idea 
to see if you could get her to 
write it for one of the Galaxy 
magazines. — James Edward Tur-

Dear Editor: 

In Hue and Cry for September, 
you said you’d try to get the new 
Heinlein novel, even if it is extra 
long; in the current Hue & Cry 
(October) you announce victory 
with “we’re going to attempt to 
bring it to you intact”. One thing 
I cannot abide is a shortened or 
“magazine” version of a novel. 
After publishing Doc Smith’s giant 
and gaining 32 pages, the length of 
any good novel should not phase 
you. 



Thanks for publishing the Re- 
tief data. Extras such as that add 
to your well deserved popularity, as 
does the Retief serial and wrap- 
around cover AND that bomb you 
planted in your editorial, some- 
thing about a few Isaac Asimov 
stories on hand . • 

Just what are you trying to 
prove? Your predecessor saved If 
from oblivion. When you took over 
were you satisfied? No, not you. 
YOU had to experiment — change

the interior, bring in “outsiders” 
like Simak, Smith, Van Vogt, Clem- 
ent and whatshisname, oh yeah, 
Heinlein. Going for the top, huh? 
Not satisfied yet you went month- 
ly and now, to top it all, you add 
thirty-two pages. Some editors are 
just plain pushy. Just what are 
you trying to prove, that you can 
win a Hugo?

• Well, we do print shorter ver- 
sions of novels sometimes (not so 
much because we impose any ar- 
bitrary length limit as because we 
sometimes have the feeling that 
the long versions are fattened up 
to fill out a book) — but The Moon 
Is a Harsh Mistress sure isn’t one 
of them! Matter of fact, the ver- 
sion you now have beginning in this 
issue of If is just about exactly the 
way Bob Heinlein wrote it, barring 
a few little stylistic changes and 
those necessary to divide it into 
installments — more so than the 
book will be I — The Editor,

Dear Editor: 

I just got around to reading your 
editorial in the September If (about 
UFOs). As a charter member of 



HUE & CRY

NIOAP, I want to say how 
I am that yon are willing to exam- 
ine the efTidenee dispassionately. 
‘Between the (^Mstructlve tactics of 
[ttie Air Force and the idiocies of 
:ihe lunatics who ^sit” and *^con- 
1 9erae^ with the space people (and 
tty the way, Pm afraid Under Two 
^ Moons win giye them ideas — they 
I have no sense of humor I) , it is hard 
, get the general public to realize 
fmw strong the actual evidence is. 
I think myself the UFOs are un- 
manned automata sent out from 
a mother riiip — like our unmanned 
explormrs In our own little solar 
ajpstem. — Miriain Allen deFord.

Dear Editor: 

The first If I read was the issue 
ior July, 1968. The serial was The 
Meefs of Space. There was a Re- 
lief story — Mightiest Qom — and 
a notice that next month A. E. 
Van Vogt's first new story in 14 
years would appear. That If was 
180 pages, the table of contents 
was printed all in black ink, and 
the title at the beginning of each 
story was blue. 

Well, The Reefs and Retief and 
Van Vogt — by the way, how do 
you pronounce that? — hooked me 
for the September issue, two months 
away. The stories and serial were 
great, and you used two colors of 
ink. I waited for November. 

In November the cover was beau- 
tiful and the entire issue was a 
prize winner. The illustrations, 
format, and the fiction were super- 
lative, and I was addicted to If. 

Things kept on piling up. A big 
list; the cover on the January '64 
issue, Water spider, the continuing 
Retief, the May All Smith issue in 



which you brought back Doe S., 
the news about Skylark DuQuesne, 
The SUkiSf If goes monthly, Fam- 
ham*s Freehold, the Gree stories. 
The Hounds of Hell, The Ultimate 
Racer — I've read that particular 
gem at least 60 times by now — 
When Time Was New (is that the 
start of some sort of series?). 
Star child, and I think Retief, God- 
Speaker, deserves some particular 
applause. The Replicators, Fred 
Saberhagen's Berserker tales, and 
. well, the list is too long to 
mention. Everything up to the 
present Skylark and the big new If. 

In some two years If has g^one 
an incredible distance from slim, 
plain little bi-monthly mag to the 
impressive, full bodied article of 
today, rotten with top quality writ- 
ers. It's rather like watching a 
small child grow up into a magni- 
ficent adulthood. Congrratulations 
and many thanks. — George Kott, 
1409 Noel Court, North Merrick,

# That takes care of our space for 
another month. 

Let's see, this month's First” is 
Gerald Pearce's Security Syndrome. 
These have been coming in at a 
pretty good clip lately, but we can 
always use more — so if you've 
been meaning to try your hand at 
writing science fiction, remember 
we print at least one new writer 
every issue .... 

Notice the banner with a strange 
device on our cover? The word is 
‘‘Tanstaafl”. If you wonder what 
it means — stick around for the 
next installment of The Moon Is 
a Harsh Mistress and let Bob Hein- 
lein tell you! The Editor

In one way, the big earnings reported 
here might be called exceptional. In 
another way, there is nothing excep- 
tional about them. That's because any 
man who will follow instructions and is 
willing to work at his own Duraclean 
business should be able to do as well 
under similar conditions. 

Each of the men quoted here had tal- 
ents and abilities different from those of 
alb the rest. But each had one thing in 
common— a desire to win personal inde- 
pendence in a business of his own. And 
each man took five identical steps to 
reach his goal. 

1. Each one read an announcement such 
as you are reading now. 2. He wrote 
for complete information. 3. He read the 
literature we sent him. 4. He gained 
new confidence in himself and the belief 
that he could succeed with Duraclean. 
5. He accepted our offer to help him get 
started. Later, he wrote to tell us about 
his success. 

In each case, remember, the first step 
was to write to Duraclean for informa- 
tion. If you would like to own a business 
of your own, why don’t you do as these 
men did — right now. 

When I hear from you, I will send you 
facts about the Duraclean Franchise 
that will open your eyes. You will see 
why a Franchise business such as ours 
makes success for the individual the rule 
rather than the exception. -j 



The Duraclean home service business 
has been tried and tested. The. market 
for Duraclean Service is tremendous — 
and growing. The methods that lead to 
success have been clearly charted. When 
an ambitious man follows these meth- 
ods, success is the logical result. 

Some Franchise businesses require 
investments as high as $50,000. With 
ours, you can get started for a few hun- 
dred dollars and we finance the balance. 
Monthly payments are so small that the 
profits on less than one day’s service can 
cover your payment for the entire 
month. Even with this small investment 
and operating as a one man business, 
your p>otential is $250.00 a week net 
profit. With two men working for you 
35 hours a week, you should gross a 
profit of $420.00. Allowing 20% for 
advertising and incidentals, the net 
would amount to $336.00. 

The most important part of Duraclean 
home service is cleaning rugs,' carpets 
and upholstered furniture by a revolu- 
tionary modern process known as the 
“Absorption Method.’’ You do the 
work right in the customer’s premises. 
No harsh scrubbing with motor-driven 
brushes. No soaking. Instead, an aer- 
ated foam loosens the dirt and holds it 
in suspension until removed. A test con- 
ducted by an impartial laboratory 
showed that the modern Absorption 
Method removed twice as much dirt as 



was removed by old fashioned machine 
scrubbing. 

If you are tired of working for others 
or of jumping from one proposition to 
another— if you have a real yearning 
for independence in a business of your 
own — then, send for “The Duraclean 
Route to Success.’’ There is no obliga- 
tion — no charge. No salesmen will call 
to high pressure you. Send for the book 
now. Read it. Then if you want to take 
the next step toward independence, you 
can write to me and let me give you the 
same help I’ve given so many other suc- 
cessful men.
