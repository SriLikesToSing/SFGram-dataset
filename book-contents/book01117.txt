Knowledge 
Anyone can 
Know about 




SCIENTOLOGY SOLVES ALLTHE MYSTERIES 



A mystery is only a lack of knowledge or 
answers. Personal knowledge can be 
acquired on any subject. Scientology is 
the modern day applied philosophy, but 
its traditions can be traced back much 
earlier than Greece. Scientology can 
answer any question you have about 
yourself, your mind, life and the uni- 
verse. Scientology solves all the 
mysteries. For example, Scientology 
solves the mystery of who is the source 
of your decisions. You are. You are 
the source of your daily decisions. 
And the only knowledge you have to 
base your decisions on is knowledge 
you have gained. Through Scientology 
you can know about anything. 

FREE BOOK 

Scientology (not a cult or an occult org- 
anization) is an international association 
of those who desire changed conditions. 
Scientology is the technology of how to 
change conditions. In our difficult times 



conditions can be changed. Things can 
be changed for you. Write today for a 
free copy of the book "A New Understand- 
ing of Life". Within its pages lies a 
changed life.

Super-Spy Lets You ‘Sec Through’ 
Walk, Fences and Locked Doors! 

Secret of Private Detectives anti Industrial Spies Revealed! 



A remarkable optica! device 
about half the size of a cigar- 
ette now makes it possible for 
you to see — without being 
seen. Your children, for 
example, can play in the 
“privacy” of an adjoining 
room — unaware that you can 
see everything they do! 
Operation of the tiny device 
is silent, almost impossible to 
detect. The eye-piece is not 
much bigger than the head of 
a pin. 

If you drilled an ordinary hole 
that size through a wall, fence 
or door, you could see very 
little. But Super-Spy’s unique 
optical principle, called “X- 
Pand,” multiplies your field of 
vision over 42 times, by 
actual test! With “X-Pand,” 
almost no detail of a room 
can escape your Super-Spy 
sight! That gives you some 
idea of Super-Spy’s powers! 
But the real surprise is the 
price: three dollars! 
Unlimited Uses: 

Super-Spy’s uses are un- 
limited. With Super-Spy, you 
can keep an eye on the kids 
while they take their naps, 
even if the door to their room 
is closed! 

With Super-Spy installed you 
can observe beyond walls in 
your home, office of factory— 
while you remain invisible ! 
Professional Uses: 

Private and hotel detectives. 
Insurance investigators. 
Undercover agents. Security 
guards; Photographers. 

Store owners — watch shop- 
lifting suspects. Employers— 
get eye-witness proof of loaf- 
ing or theft. Hospital staff- 
watch restless patients with- 
out disturbing them. House- 
wives — see a salesman or 



through a special division 
(Detection Appliances) of a 
reputable mail order firm. 
The parent firm’s total sales 
throughout U.S. are over 
$1,000,000. The owner has been 
a respected local businessman 
for 19 years. 

5-Year Service Guarantee 
Super-Spy is sold with this 
5-year guarantee: If it fails 
to work due to any defect in 
material or workmanship, you 
can return it as directed and 
pay ONLY the postage. With- 
out any charge , D.A. will

stranger at the door — while 
you stay safely hidden! 

You can even take pictures 
through its low-distortion, lens ! 

Important and Profitable 
What will you do with Super- 
Spy? If it’s important, in your 
home, for you to know what 
people do when they don’t

(and there’s no invasion of 
privacy) — get Super-Spy! 

Order spares for sudden or

MAKING MODELS 



W e attended a conference a 
short time ago in which 
one of the speakers was going on 
about trends. By 1985 the Gross 
National Product would be so 
many hundreds of billions of dol- 
lars, by 1990 technological un- 
employment would reach such- 
and-such a percentage, etc; and 
it prompted the fellow sitting 
next to us, who happened to be 
an industrial psychologist, to 
construct a trend of his own. Ten 
years ago only 0.0001% of the 
population were industrial psy- 
chologists. Today nearly 0.01% 
of the population are industrial 
psychologists; clearly by the year 
1990 well over 200% of the pop- 
ulation will be industrial psy- 
chologists. 



Even allowing for moonlight- 
ing, that seems unlikely; and 
that’s one of the things wrong 
with straight-line prediction as a 
form of peering into the future. 

As a matter of fact, in this par- 
ticular branch of crystal-ball 
gazing called science fiction we’ve 
just about given up straight-line 
predictions except for farce, be- 
cause naturally the results of any 
continued curve is pretty ludi- 
crous. What we do, instead of 
predicting — and we do it pretty 
well — is model-making. We say, 
“If A, then B.” “A” need not be 
very likely In itself; it may be 
such an improbable assumption 
as an invasion by ant-men from 
Betelgeuse or a discovery of a 
way to travel through the fourth

dimension. But the rules of the 
game are such that “B” should 
follow rigorously and inevitably 
from it, and the more “back- 
ground noise” that is included in 
determining “B”, the more cross- 
fertilization from whatever other 
events and tendencies the author 
can cope with, the more elegant 
and interesting the model — the 
science-fiction story, that is — is 
likely to be. 

Of course, that’s not the only 
kind of science-fiction story there 
is; as a general proposition, any 
statement beginning “a science- 
fiction story is ...” is false. But 
science-fiction does have a spec- 
ial place in the hearts of many 
persons, because it is the “model- 
making literature” — the only 
field of imaginative writing that 
can describe events affecting 
anyone, in any place, at any 
time. 

T he special advantage of mod- 
el-making over the more 
traditional methods of looking 
into the future is that the model- 
maker can allow for break- 
throughs, surprises, unanticipated 
events. 

The old adage says that “com- 
ing events cast their shadows be- 
fore” . and so they do, if you’re 
talking about next week’s stock- 
market reports, or next year’s 
arms budget. But the really big 
events in human history may 



very well not. It was impossible 
to “predict” electronics, radar, 
television and so on more than 
a century ago, because it wasn’t 
until Hertz that there was any 
suspicion of an RF form of en- 
ergy. And that’s the special tal- 
ent of science-fiction: to predict 
the intrinsically unpredictable . 

Speaking of which . 

One of the “intrinsically unpre- 
dictable” events of human his- 
tory, at least until recently, was 
star travel. Science fiction has 
been playing with it for half a 
century, of course; but it was 
pure fantasy and we all knew it. 

Not any more. Here’s a pre- 
diction for you: Within the next 
few months — in this year of 
1967 — an announcement will be 
made of a breakthrough in inter- 
stellar propulsion. Speeds: be- 
tween 1/10 and 1/3 the velocity 
of light. Mass ratio: no worse 
than 1/100, maybe as good as 
1/10. (For comparison, the mass 
ratio of each step of a three- 
stage rocket may be 1/10, mean- 
ing that 1,000 pounds must get 
off the launching pad for each 
pound of ultimate payload.) 

What it means is that, if you 
are now in reasonably good 
health, you will probably live to 
see the launching of a spacecraft 
that will go to Alpha Centauri 
and return. And that’s a predic- 
tion .

Illustrated by MORROW 



Carnaby had a duty, and it was 
more important to him than his 
reputation — or even his life! 



I 

/Carnaby folded his cards with- 
v J out showing them, tossed 
them into the center of the table. 

“Time for me to make my 
TX.” He pushed back his chair 
and rose, a tall, wide-shouldered, 
gray-haired man, still straight- 
backed, but thickening through 
the body now. “It’s just as well. 
You boys pretty well cleaned me 
out for tonight.” 



“You still got the badge,” a 
big-faced man with quick, sly 
eyes said. “Play you a hand of 
showdown for it.” 

Carnaby rubbed a thumb 
across the tiny jeweled comet in 
his lapel and smiled slightly. 
“Fleet property, Sal,” he said. 

The big-faced man showed a 
glint of gold tooth, flicked his 
eyes at the others. “Yeah,” he 
said. “I guess I forgot.” He wink- 
ed at a foxy man on his left.

“Say, uh, any promotions come 
through yet?” He was grinning 
openly at Carnaby now. 

“Not yet.” Carnaby pushed his 
chair in. 

“Twenty-one years in grade,” 
Sal said genially. “Must be some 
kind of record.” He took out a 
toothpick and plied it on a back 
tooth. 

“Shut up, Sal,” one of the other 
men said. “Leave Jimmy make 
his TX.” 

“All these years, with no trans- 
fer, no replacement,” Sal per- 
sisted. “Not even a letter from 
home. Looks like maybe they 
forgot you’re out here, Carnaby.” 

“It’s not Jim’s fault if they 
don’t get in touch,” a white- 
haired man said. “Meantime, he’s 
carrying out his orders.” 

“Some orders.” Sal lolled back 
in his chair. “Kind of makes a 
man wonder if he ever really had 
any orders.” 

“I seen his orders myself, the 
day the cruiser dropped him in 
here,” the white-haired man said. 
“He was to set up the beacon 
station and man it until he was 
relieved. It ain’t his fault if they 
ain't been back for him.” 

“Yeah.” Sal shot a hard glance 
at the speaker. “I know you 
‘claim?’” 

The white-haired man 
frowned. “What do you mean, 
‘claim’?” 

“Take it easy, Harry.” Carna- 



by caught the big-faced man’s 
eyes, held them. “He didn’t mean 
anything — did you, Sal?” 

Sal looked at Carnaby for a 
long moment. Then he grunted 
a laugh and reached to rake in 
the pot. “Nah, I didn’t mean any- 
thing.” 

A cold wind whipped at Cama- 
by as he walked alone past 
the half-dozen ramshackle stores. 
They comprised the business dis- 
trict of the single surviving settle- 
ment on the frontier planet, 
Longone. 

At the foot of the unpaved 
street a figure detached itself 
from the shadow under a pole- 
mounted light. 

“Hello, Lieutenant Carnaby,” a 
youthful voice greeted him. “I 
been waiting for you.” 

“Hello, Terry.” Carnaby swung 
his gate open. “You’re out late.” 
“I been working on my Blue 
codes, Lieutenant.” The boy fol- 
lowed him up the path, describing 
the difficulties he had encounter- 
ed in mastering Fleet crypto- 
graphic theory. Inside the modest 
bungalow, Carnaby went into the 
small room he used as an office, 
took the gray dust-cover from the 
compact, Navy issue VFP trans- 
mitter set up on a small desk 
beside a rough fieldstone fire- 
place. He settled himself in the 
chair before it with a sigh, flicked 
on the SEND and SCR switches,

studied the half dozen instrument 
faces, carefully noted their read- 
ings in a dark blue polyon-backed 
notebook. 

The boy stood by as Carnaby 
depressed the tape key which 
would send the recorded call let- 
ters of the one-man station flash- 
ing outward as a shaped wave- 
front, propagated at the square 
speed of light. 

“Lieutenant.” The boy shook 
his head. “Every night you send 
out your call. How come you 
never get an answer?” 

Carnaby shook his head. “I 
don’t know, Terry. Maybe they’re 
too busy fighting the Djann to 
check in with every little JN 
beacon station on the Outline.” 

“You said after five years they 
were supposed to come back and 
pick you up,” the boy persisted. 
“Why — ” 

There was a sharp, wavering 
tone from the round, wire-mesh 
covered speaker. A dull red light 
winked on, blinked in a rapid 
flutter, settled down to a steady 
glow. The audio signal firmed to 
a raucous buzz. 

“Lieutenant!” Terry blurted. 
“Something’s coming in!” 

TT'or a moment Carnaby sat 
rigid. Then he thumbed the 
big S-R key to receive, flipped 
the selector lever to UNSC, 
snapped a switch tagged RCD.

a voice faint with distance whis- 
pered through a rasp and crackle 
of star-static. “Cincsec One-two-

one-oh-four . stations copy . 
Terem Aldo . Terem . pha

“What is it, Lieutenant?” The 
boy’s voice broke with excitement. 

“A Fleet Action signal,” Carna- 
by said tensely. “An all-station, 
recorded. I’m taping it; if they 
repeat it a couple of times, I’ll 
get it all.” 

They listened, heads close to 
the speaker grille; the voice faded 
and swelled. It reached the end 
of the message, began again: 
“Red priority .... tions . 
incsec One two ...” 

The message repeated five 
times; then the voice ceased. The 
wavering carrier hum went on 
another five seconds, cut off. The 
red light winked out. Carnaby 
flipped over the SEND key, 
twisted the selector to VOC-SQ. 

“JN 37 Ace Trey to Cincsec 
One-two-oh,” he transmitted in 
a tense voice. “Acknowledging re- 
ceipt Fleet TX 104. Request clar- 
ification.” 

Then he waited, his face taut, 
for a reply to his transmission, 
which had been automatically 
taped, condensed to a one-micro- 
second squawk, and repeated ten 
times at one second intervals. 

Carnaby shook his head after

a silent minute had passed. “No 
good. From the sound of the 
Fleet beam, Cincsec One-two-oh 
must be a long way from here.” 

“Try again, lieutenant! Tell 
’em you’re here, tell ’em it’s time 
they came back for you! Tell 

“They can’t hear me, Terry.” 
Carnaby’s face was tight. “I 
haven’t got the power to punch 
across that kind of distance.” He 
keyed the playback. The filtered 
composite signal came through 
clearly now: 

“Red priority to all stations. 
Cincsec One-two-oh to Rim HQ 
via Cincfleet Nine-two. All Fleet 
Stations copy. Pass to Terem 
Aldo Cerise, Terem Alpha Two 
and ancillaries. This message in 
two parts. Part one: CTF Forty- 
one reports breakthrough of 
Djann armed tender on standard 
vector three-three-seven, mark; 
three-oh-five, mark; oh-four - 
two. This is a Category One 
Alert. Code G applies. Class Four 
through Nine stations stand by 
on Status Green. Part Two. Inner 
Warning Line units divert all 
traffic lanes three-four through 
seven-one. Outer Beacon Line sta- 
tions activate main beacon, puls- 
ing code schedule gamma eight. 
Message ends. All stations ac- 
knowledge.” 

“What’s all that mean, Lieu- 
tenant?” Terry’s eyes seemed to 
bulge with excitement. 



“It means I’m going to get 
some exercise, Terry.” 

“Exercise how?” 

Carnaby took out a handker- 
chief and wiped it across his fore- 
head. “That was a general order 
from Sector Command. Looks 
like they’ve got a rogue bogie on 
the loose. I’ve got to put the 
beacon on the air.” 

Tie turned to look out through 
-*■ the curtained window beside 
the bookcase toward the tower- 
ing ramparts of the nine-thou- 
sand-foot volcanic freak known 
as Thunderhead, gleaming white 
in the light of the small but bril- 
liant moon. Terry followed Car- 
naby’s glance. 

“Gosh, Lieutenant! You mean 
you got to climb Old Thunder- 
head?” 

“That’s where I set the beacon 
up, Terry,” Carnaby said mild- 
ly. “On the highest ground 
around.” 

“Sure — but your flitter was 
working then!” 

“It’s not such a tough climb, 
Terry. I’ve made it a few times, 
just to check on things.” He was 
studying the rugged contour of 
the moonlit steep, which resem- 
bled nothing so much as a mass 
of snowy cumulus. There was 
snow on the high ledges, but the 
wind would have scoured the 
east face clear .... 

“Not in the last five years,

THUNDERHEAD 



you haven’t, Lieutenant!” Terry 
sounded agitated. 

“I haven’t had a Category One 
Alert, either,” Carnaby smiled. 

“Maybe they didn’t mean 
you,” Terry said. 

They called for Outer Beacon 
Line stations. That’s me.” 

“They don’t expect you to do 
it on foot,” Terry protested. “This 
time o’ year!” 

Carnaby looked at the boy, 
smiling slightly. “I guess maybe 
they do, Terry.” 

“Then they’re wrong!” Terry’s 
thin face looked pale. “Don’t go, 
Lieutenant!” 

“It’s my job, Terry. It’s what 
I’m here for. You know that.” 

“What if you never got the 
message?” Terry countered. 
“What if the radio went on the 
blink, like all the rest of the stuff 
you brought in here with you — 
the flitter, and the food unit, and 
the scooter? Then nobody’d ex- 
pect you to get yourself killed!” 
The boy whirled suddenly. He 
grabbed up a poker from the fire- 
place, swung it against the front 
of the communicator, brought it 
down a second time before Car- 
naby caught his arm. 

“You shouldn’t have done that, 
Terry,” he said softly. His eyes 
were on the smashed instrument 
faces. 

“That . hurts . .” the lad 
gasped. 

“Sorry.” Carnaby released the 



boy’s thin arm. He stooped, pick- 
ed up a fragment of a broken 
name-plate with the words 
FLEET SIGNAL ARM. 

Terry stared at him; his mouth 
worked as though he wanted to 
speak, but couldn’t find the 
words. “I’m going with you,” he 
said at last. 

Carnaby shook his head. 
“Thanks, Terry. But you’re just 
a boy. I need a man along on 
this trip.” 

Terry’s narrow face tightened. 
“Boy, hell,” he said defiantly. 
“I’m seventeen!” 

“I didn’t mean anything, Ter- 
ry. Just that I need a man who’s 
had some trail experience.” 
“How’m I going to get any 
trail experience, Lieutenant, if 
I don’t start sometime?” 

“Better to start with an easier 
climb than Thunderhead,” Car- 
naby said gently. “You better go 
along home now, Terry. Your 
uncle will be getting worried.” 
“When . when you leaving, 
Lieutenant?” 

“Early. I’ll need all the day- 
light I can get to make Halliday’s 
Roost by sundown.” 

II 

A fter the boy had gone, Car- 
naby went to the storage 
room at the rear of the house 
and checked over the meager 
store of issue supplies. He exam-

ined the cold suit, shook his head 
over the brittleness of the wir- 
ing. At least it had been a loose 
fit; he’d still be able to get into it. 

He left the house then, walked 
down to Maverik’s store. The 
game had broken up, but half a 
dozen men still sat around the 
old hydrogen space heater. They 
looked up casually. 

“I need a man,” Carnaby said 
without preamble. “I’ve got a 
climb to make in the morning.” 
“What’s got into you?” Yank 
Pepper rocked his ehair back, 
glanced toward Sal Maverik. 
“Never knew you to go in for 
exercises before breakfast.” 

“I got an Alert Signal just 
now,” Carnaby said. “From a 
Fleet unit in Deep Space. 
They’ve scared up a Djann 
blockade-runner. My orders are 
to activate the beacon.” 

Maverik clattered a garbage 
can behind the bar. “Kind of 
early in the evening for falling 
out of bed with a bad dream, 
ain’t it?” he inquired loudly. 

“You got a call in from the 
Navy?” The white-haired man 
named Harry frowned at Carna- 
by. “Hell, Jimmy, I thought. .” 
“I just need a man along to 
help me pack gear as far as' 
Halliday’s Roost. I’ll make the 
last leg alone.” 

“Ha!” Pepper looked around. 
“That’s all; just as far as Halli- 
day’s Roost!” 



“You gone nuts, Carnaby?” 
Sal Maverick growled. “Nobody 
in his right mind would tackle 
that damned rock after first 
snow, even if he had a reason.” 
“Halliday’s hut ought to 
still be standing,” Carnaby said. 
“We can overnight there, and — ” 
“Jimmy, wait a minute,” Har- 
ry said. “All this about orders, 
and climbing old Thunderhead; 
it don’t make sense! You mean 
after all these years they pick 
you to pull a damn fool stunt like 
that?” 

“It’s a general order to all Outer 
Line stations. They don’t know 
my flitter’s out of action.” 
Harry shook his head. “Forget 
it, Jimmy. Nobody can make a 
climb like that at this time of 
year.” 

“Fleet wants that beacon on 
the air,” Carnaby said. “I guess 
they’ve got a reason; maybe a 
good reason.” 

ATaverik spat loudly in the 
1 ' -^direction of a sand-filled can. 
“You’re the one’s been the big- 
shot Navy man for the last twen- 
ty years around here,” he said. 
“The big man with the fancy 
badge. Okay, your brass want you 
to go run up a hill, go ahead. 
Don’t come in here begging for 
somebody to do your job for 
you.” 

“Listen, Jim,” Harry said ur- 
gently. “I remember when you 



THUNDERHEAD 



15 



first came here, a young kid in 
your twenties, fresh out of the 
Academy. Five years you was to 
be here; they’ve left you here to 
rot for twenty! Now they come in 
with this piece of tomfoolery. 
Well, to hell with ’em! After five 
years, all bets were off. You got 
no call to risk your neck — ” 

“It’s still my job, Harry.” 
Harry rose and came over to 
Carnaby. He put a hand on the 
big man’s shoulder. “Let’s quit 
pretending, Jim,” he said softly. 
“They’re never coming back for 
you, you know that. The high tide 
of the Concordiat dropped you 
here. For twenty years the traf- 
fic’s been getting sparser, the 
transmitters dropping off the air. 
Adobe’s deserted now, and Pet- 
reac. Another few years and 
Longone’ll be dead, too.” 

“We’re not dead yet.” 

“That message might have 
come from the other end of the 
galaxy, Jim! For all you know, 
it’s been on the way for a 
hundred years!” 

Carnaby faced him, a big, 
solidly-built man with a lined 
face. “You could be right on all 
counts,” he said. “It wouldn’t 
change anything.” 

Harry sighed, turned away. “If 
I was twenty years younger, I 
might go along, just to keep you 
company, Jimmy. But I’m not. 
I’m old.” 

He turned to face Carnaby. 



“Like you, Jim. Just too old.” 

“Thanks anyway, Harry.” Car- 
naby looked at the other men in 
the room, nodded slowly. Sal’s 
right,” he said. “It’s my lookout, 
and nobody else’s.” He turned 
and pushed back out into the 
windy street. 

A board the Armed Picket Mal- 
thusa, five million tons, nine 
months out of Fleet HQ on Van- 
dieman’s World on a routine 
Deep Space sweep, Signal-Lieu- 
tenant Pryor, Junior Communi- 
cations Officer on message deck 
duty, listened to the playback of 
the brief transmission the Duty 
NCOIC had called to his atten- 
tion: 

“JN 37 Ace Trey to Cine sec 
One . Fleet TX . clarifi- 
cation,” the voice came through 
with much crackling. 

“That’s all I could get out of 
it, Lieutenant,” the signalman 
said. “I wouldn’t have picked it 
up, if I hadn’t been filtering the 
Y band looking for AK’s on 
104.” 

The officer punched keys, 
scanning a listing that flashed 
onto the small screen on his 
panel. 

“There’s no JN37 Ace Trey 
listed, Charlie,” he said. He key- 
ed the playback, listened to the 
garbled message again. 

“Maybe it’s some outworld 
sheep-herder amusing himself.” 



16 



GALAXY 



“With WFP equipment? On Y 
channel?” The NCO furrowed his 
forehead. 

“Yeah.” The lieutenant frown- 
ed. “See if you can get back to 
him with a station query, Char- 
lie. See who this guy is.” 

“I’ll try, sir; but he came in 
with six millisec lag. That puts 
him halfway from here to Rim.” 
The lieutenant crossed the 
room with the NCO, stood by as 
the latter sent the standard Con- 
firm ID code. There was no re- 
ply- 

“I guess we lost him, sir. You 
want me to log him?” 

“No, don’t bother.” 

The big repeater panel chat- 
tered then, and the officer hurried 
back to his console, settled down 
to the tedious business of trans- 
mitting follow-up orders to the 
fifty-seven hundred Fleet Sta- 
tions of the Inner Line. 

Ill 

nphe orange sun of Longone was 
still below the eastern hori- 
zon when Carnaby came out the 
gate to the road. Terry Sickle was 
there, waiting for him. 

“You got to get up early to 
beat me out, Lieutenant,” he said 
in a tone of forced jocularity. 

“What are you doing here, 
Terry?” 

“I heard you still need a man,” 
the lad said, less cocky now. 



Carnaby started to shake his 
head, and Terry cut in with: “I 
can help pack some of the gear 
you’ll need to try the high 

slope.” 

“Terry, go on back home, son. 
That high slope’s no place for 
you.” 

“How’m I going to qualify for 
the Fleet when your ship comes, 
Lieutenant, if I don’t start get- 
ting some experience?” 

“I appreciate it, Terry. It’s 
good to know I have a friend. 
But — ” 

“Lieutenant — what’s a friend, 
if he can’t help you when you 
need it?” 

“I need you here when I get 
back, to have a hot meal waiting 
for me, Terry.” 

“Lieutenant . ” All the 

spring had gone from the boy’s 
stance. “I’ve known you all my 
life. All I ever wanted was to 
be with you on Navy business. 
If you go up there, alone . ” 

Carnaby looked at the boy, 
the dejected slump of his thin 
shoulders. 

“Your uncle know you’re here, 
Terry?” 

“Sure. Uh, he thought it was 
a fine idea, me going with you.” 

“All right, then, Terry, if you 
want to. As far as Halliday’s 
Roost. Thanks.” 

“Oh, boy, Lieutenant! We’ll 
have a swell time. I’m a good 
climber, you’ll see!” He grinned

from ear to ear, squinting through 
the early gloom at Carnaby. 

“Hey, Lieutenant, you’re 
rigged out like a real ...” he 
broke off. “I thought you’d oh, 
wore out all your issue gear,” he 
finished lamely. 

“Seemed like for this trek I 
ought to be in uniform,” Carnaby 
said. “And the coldsuit will feel 
good, up on the high slopes.” 

r T''he two moved off down the 
dark street. There were lights 
on in Sal Maverik’s general store. 
The door opened as they came 
up; Sal emerged, carrying a flour 
sack, his mackinaw collar turned 
up around his ears. He grunted 
a greeting, then swung to stare 
at Carnaby. 

“Hey, by God! Look at him, 
dressed fit to kill!” 

“The lieutenant got a hot-line 
message in from Fleet Head- 
quarters last night,” Terry said. 

“We got no time to jaw with 
you, Maverik.” He brushed past 
the heavy-set man. 

“You watch your mouth, boy,” 
Sal snapped. “Carnaby,” he 
raised his voice, “this poor kid 
the best you could get to hold 
your hand?” 

“What do you mean, poor 
kid?” Terry started back. Carna- 
by caught his arm. 

“We’re on official business, 
Terry,” he said. Eyes front and 
keep them there.” 



“Playing Navy, hah? That’s a 
hot one,” the storekeeper called 
after the two. “What kind of 
orders you get? To take a goony- 
bird census, up in the foothills?” 
“Don’t pay him no attention, 
Lieutenant,” Terry said, his voice 
unsteady. “He’s as full of mean- 
ness as a rotten meal-spud is 
of weevils.” 

“He’s had some big dis- 
appointments in his life, Terry. 
That makes a man bitter.” 

“I guess you did, too, Lieuten- 
ant. It ain’t made you mean.” 
Terry looked sideways at Car- 
naby. “I don’t reckon you beat 
out the competition to get an 
Academy appointment and then 
went through eight years of 
training just for this.” He made 
a gesture that took in the sweep 
of the semi-arid landscape 
stretching away to the big world’s 
far horizon, broken only by the 
massive outcroppings of the pale, 
convoluted lava cores spaced at 
intervals of a few miles along 
a straight fault line that extend- 
ed as far as men had explored 
the desolate world. 

Carnaby laughed softly. “No, 
I had big ideas about seeing the 
galaxy, making Fleet Admiral, 
and coming home covered with 
gold braid and glory.” 

“You leave any folks behind, 
Lieutenant?” Terry inquired, 
waxing familiar in the comrade- 
ship of the trail.

“No wife. There was a girl. 
And my half-brother, Tom. A 
nice kid. He’d be over forty, 
now.” 

“Lieutenant — I’m sorry I 
busted up your transmitter. You 
might have got through, gotten 
yourself taken off this God- 
forsaken place — ” 

“Never mind, Terry.” 

The dusky sun was up now, 
staining the rounded, lumpy 
flank of Thunderhead a deep 
scarlet. 

Carnaby and Sickle crossed the 
first rock-slope, entered the brok- 
en ground where the prolific 
rock-lizards eyed them as they 
approached, then heaved them- 
selves from their perches, scuttled 
away into the black shadows 
of the deep crevices opened in 
the porous rock by the action 
of ten million years of wind 
and sand erosion on thermal 
cracks. 

Five hundred feet above the 
plain, Carnaby looked back at 
the settlement. Only a mile away, 
it was almost lost against the 
titanic spread of empty wilder- 
ness. 

“Terry, why don’t you go back 
now?” he said. “Your uncle will 
have a nice breakfast waiting for 
you.” 

“I’m looking forward to sleep- 
ing out,” the boy said confidently. 
“We better keep pushing, or we 
won’t make the Roost by dark.” 



I n the officers’ off-duty bay, 
Signal-Lieutenant Pryor 
straightened from over the bil- 
liard table as the nasal voice of 
the command deck yeoman 
broke into the recorded dance 
music : 

“Now hear this. Commodore 
Broadly will address ship’s com- 
pany.” 

“Ten to one he says we’ve 
lost the bandit.” Supply-lieuten- 
ant Aaron eyed the annunciator 
panel. 

“Gentlemen.” The sonorous 
tones of the ship’s commander 
sounded relaxed, unhurried. “We 
now have a clear track on the 
Djann blockade runner, which 
indicates he will attempt to 
evade our Inner Line defenses 
and lose himself in Rim terri- 
tory. In this I propose to dis- 
appoint him. I have directed 
Colonel Lancer to launch inter- 
ceptors to take up stations along 
a conic, subsuming thirty degrees 
on axis from the presently con- 
structed vector. We may expect 
contact in approximately three 
hours time.” 

A recorded bos’n’s whistle 
shrilled the end-of-message sig- 
nal. 

“So?” Aaron raised his eye- 
brows. “A three-million tonner 
swats a ten-thousand-ton side- 
boat. Big deal.” 



20 



GALAXY 



“That boat can punch just as 
big a hole in the blockade as a 
Super-D,” Pryor said. “Not that 
the Djann have any of those left 
to play with.” 

“We kicked the damned spid- 
ers back into their home system 
ten years ago,” Aaron said tiredly. 
“In my opinion, the whole Con- 
tainment operation’s a boon- 
doggle to justify a ten -million- 
man fleet.” 

“As long as there are any of 
them alive, they’re a threat,” 
Pryor repeated the slogan. 

“Well, Broadly sounds as 
though he’s got the bogie in the 
bag,” Aaron yawned. 

“Maybe he has.” Pryor ad- 
dressed the ball carefully, sent 
the ivory sphere cannoning 
against the target. 

“He wouldn’t go on record 
with it if he didn’t think he was 
on to a sure thing.” 

“He’s a disappointed ’ceptor- 
jockey. What makes him think 
that pirate don’t duck back of 
some kind of a blind spot and 
go dead?” 

“It’s worth a try — and if he 
nails it, it will be a feather in 
his cap.” 

“Another star on his collar, 
you mean.” 

“Uh-huh, that too.” 

“We’re wasting our time,” 
Aaron said. 

“But that’s his look out. Six 
ball in the corner pocket.” 



A s Commodore Broadly turned 
away from the screen on 
which he had delivered his posi- 
tion report to the crew of the 
great war vessel, his eye met 
that of his executive officer. The 
latter shifted his gaze uneasily. 

“Well, Roy, you expect me to 
announce to all hands that Cine- 
fleet has committed a major 
blunder letting this bandit slip 
through the picket line?” he de- 
manded with some asperity. 

“Certainly not, sir.” The offi- 
cer looked worried. “But in view 
of the seriousness of the break 
out . ” 

“There are some things better 
kept in the highest command 
channels,” the commodore said 
shortly. “You and I are aware 
of the grave consequences of a 
new release of their damned seed 
in an uncontaminated sector of 
the Eastern Arm. But 1 see no 
need to arouse the parents, aunts, 
uncles and cousins of every ap- 
prentice technician aboard in an 
overly candid disclosure of the 
facts!” 

“I thought Containment had 
done its job by now,” the captain 
said. “It’s been three years since 
the last Djann sighting outside 
the Reservation. It seems vye’re 
not the only ones who’re keeping 
things under our hats.” 

Broadly frowned. “Mmmm. I 
agree, I’m placed at something 
of a disadvantage in my tactical 



THUNDERHEAD 



21 



planning by the over-secretive- 
ness of the General Staff. How- 
ever, there can be no two opin- 
ions as to the correctness of my 
present course.” 

The exec glanced ceilingward. 

“I hope so, sir.” 

“Having the admiral aboard 
makes you nervous, does it, 
Roy?” Broadly said in a tone of 
heartiness. “Well, I regard it 
merely as an opportunity better 
to display Malthusa’s capabili- 
ties!” 

“Commodore, you don’t think 
it would be wise to coordinate 
with the admiral on this — ” 

“I’m in command of this ves- 
sel,” Broadly said sharply. “I’m 
carrying the vice-admiral as 
supercargo, nothing more!” 

“He’s still Task Group CINC 
>> 

“I’m comming this ship, Roy, 
not Old Carbuncle!” Broadly 
rocked on his heels, watching 
the screen where a quadrangle of 
bright points representing his in- 
terceptor squadron fanned out, on 
an intersecting course with the 
fleeing Djann vessel. “I’ll pinch 
off this break-through single- 
handed; and all of us will share 
in the favorable attention the 
operation will bring us!” 

I n his quarters on the VIP 
deck, the vice-admiral studied 
the Utter Top Secret dispatch 
which had been handed to him 



five minutes earlier by his staff 
signal-major. 

“It looks as though this is no 
ordinary boatload of privateers.” 
He looked soberly at the elderly 
communicator. “They’re reported 
to be carrying a new weapon of 
unassessed power and a cargo 
of spore-racks that will knock 
Containment into the next con- 
tinuum.” 

“It doesn’t look good, sir.” The 
major wagged his head. 

“I note that the commodore 
has taken action according to the 
manual.” The admiral’s voice 
was non-committal. 

The major frowned. “Let’s 
hope that’s sufficient, Admiral.” 
“It should be. The bogie’s only 
a converted tender. She couldn’t 
be packing much in the way of 
fire power in that space, secret 
weapon or no secret weapon.” 
“Have you mentioned this as- 
pect to the commodore, sir?” 
“Would it Change anything, 
Ben?” 

“Nooo. I suppose not.” 

“Then we’ll let him carry on 
without any more cause for 
jumpiness than the presence of a 
vice-admiral on board is already 
providing.” 

/Crouched in his fitted accelera- 
tion cradle aboard the Djann 
vessel, the One-Who-Commands 
studied the motion of the charg- 
ed molecules in the sensory tank.

“Now the Death-Watcher dis- 
patches his messengers,” he com- 
muned with the three link-broth- 
ers who formed the Chosen Crew. 
“Now is the hour of the testing 
of Djann.” 

“Profound is the rhythm of 
our epic,” the One-Who-Records 
sang out. “We are the Chosen-to- 
Be-Heroic, and in our tiny car- 
go, Djann lives still, his future 
glory inherent in the convoluted 
spores!!’ 

“It was a grave risk to put the 
destiny of Djann at hazard in 
this wild gamble,” the One-Who- 
Refutes reminded his link- 
brothers. “If we fail, the genera- 
tions yet unborn will slumber on 
in darkness or perish in ice or 
fire.” 

“Yet if we succeed! If the New 
Thing we have learned serves 
well its function — then will 
Djann live anew!” 

“Now the death-messengers of 
the Water-Being approach,” the 
One-Who-Commands pointed 
out. “Link well, brothers! The 
energy-aggregate waits for our 
directing impulse. Now we burn 
away the dross of illusions from 
the hypothesis of the theorists 
in the harsh crucible of reality!” 

“In such a fire, the flame of 
Djann coruscates in unparalleled 
glory!” the One-Who-Records 
exulted. “Time has ordained this 
conjunction to try the timbre of 
our souls!” 



“Then channel your trained 
faculties, brothers.” The One- 
Who-Commands gathered his 
forces, feeling out delicately to 
the ravening nexus of latent en- 
ergy contained in the thought- 
shell poised at the center of the 
stressed-space field enclosing the 
fleeting vessel. “Hold the sacred 
fire sucked from the living bodies 
of a million of our fellows,” he 
exhorted. “Shape it and hurl it 
in well-directed bolts at the 
death-bringers, for the future 
and glory of Djann!” 

V 

A t noon, Carnaby and Sickle 
rested on a nearly horizontal 
slope of rock that curved to meet 
the vertical wall that swelled up 
and away overhead. Their faces 
and clothes were gray with the 
impalpable dust whipped up by 
the brisk wind. Terry spat grit 
from his mouth, passed a can of 
hot stew and a plastic water flask 
to Carnaby. 

“Getting cool already,” he said. 
“Must not be more’n ten above 
freezing.” 

“We might get a little more 
snow before morning.” Carnaby 
eyed the milky sky. “You’d bet- 
ter head back now, Terry. No 
point in you getting caught in a 
storm.” 

“I’m in for the play,” the boy 
said shortly. “Say, Lieutenant, 



THUNDERHEAD

you got another transmitter up 
there at the beacon station you 
might get through on?” 

Carnaby shook his head. “Just 
the beacon tube, the lens genera- 
tors and a power pack. It’s a 
stripped-down installation- 
There’s a code receiver, but it’s 
only designed to receive classi- 
fied instruction input.” 

“Too bad.” They ate in silence 
for a few minutes, looking out 
over the plain below. “Lieutenant, 
when this is over,” Sickle said 
suddenly, “we got to do some- 
thing. There’s got to be some 
way to remind the Navy about 
you being here!” 

Carnaby tossed the empty can 
aside and stood. “I put a couple 
of messages on the air, sub-light, 
years ago,” he said. “That’s all 
I can do.” 

“Heck, Lieutenant, it takes six 
years just to make the relay sta- 
tion on Goy! Then if somebody 
happens to pick up the call and 
boost it, in another ten years 
some Navy brass might even see 
it. And then if he’s in a good 
mood he might tell somebody to 
look into it, next time they’re out 
this way!” 

“Best I could do, Terry, now 
that the liners don’t call any 
more.” 

Carnaby finished his stew and 
dropped the can. He watched it 
roll off down-slope, clatter over 
the edge, a tiny sound lost in 

24 



the whine and shrill of the wind. 
He looked up at the rampart 
ahead. 

“We better get moving,” he 
said. “We’ve got a long climb 
to make before dark.” 

Qignal-lieutenant Pryor awoke 
^ to the strident buzz of his 
bunk-side telephone. 

“Sir, the commodore’s called 
a Condition Yellow,” the message 
Deck NCO informed him. “It 
looks like that bandit blasted 
through our intercept and took 
out two Epsilon-classes while he 
was at it. I got a stand-by from 
command deck, and — ” 

“I’ll be right up,” Pryor said 
quickly. 

Five minutes later, he stood 
with the on-duty signals crew, 
reading out an incoming from 
fleet. He Whistled. 

“Brother, they’ve got some- 
thing new!” he looked at Captain 
Aaron. “Did you check out the 
vector they had to make to reach 
their new position in the time 
they’ve had?” 

“Probably a foul-up in track- 
ing.” Aaron looked ruffled, rout- 
ed out of a sound sleep. 

“The commodore’s counting 
off the scale,” the NCO said. 
“He figured he had ’em boxed.” 

The annunciator beeped. The 
yeoman announced Malthusa’s 
commander. 

“All right, you men!” The 

GALAXY 



voice had a rough edge to it now. 
“The enemy has an idea he can 
maul Fleet units and go his way 
unmolested. I intend to disabuse 
him of that notion! I’m ordering 
a course change. I’ll maintain 
contact with this bandit until 
such time as units designated for 
the purpose have reported his 
neutralization! This vessel is un- 
der a Condition Yellow at this 
time and need not remind you 
that relevant sections of the man- 
ual will be adhered to with full 
rigor!” 

Pryor and Aaron looked at 
each, eyebrows raised. “He must 
mean business if he’s willing to 
risk straining seams with a full- 
vector course change,” the former 
said. 

“So we pull six on and six off 
until he gets it out of his sys- 
tem,” Aaron growled. “I knew 
this cruise wasn’t going to work 
out as soon as I heard Old Car- 
buncle would be aboard.” 

“What’s he got to do with it? 
Broady’s running this action.” 

“Don’t worry, he’ll be in it 
before we’re through.” 

An the slope, three thousand 
feet above the plain, Carna- 
by and Terry hugged the rock- 
face, working their way upward. 
Aside from the steepness of the 
incline, the going was of no more 
than ordinary difficulty here; the 
porous rock, resistant though it 



was to the erosive forces that 
had long ago stripped away the 
volcanic cone of which the re- 
maining mass had formed the 
core, had deteriorated in its sur- 
face sufficiently to afford easy 
hand and foot-holds. Now Terry 
paused, leaning against the rock. 
Carnaby saw that under the 
layer of dust, the boy’s face was 
pale and drawn. 

“Not much farther, Terry,” he 
said. He settled himself in a se- 
cure position, his feet wedged in 
a cleft. His own arms were feel- 
ing the strain now; there was the 
beginning of a slight tremble in 
his knees after the hours of 
climbing. 

“I didn’t figure to slow you 
down, Lieutenant.” Terry’s voice 
showed the strain of his fatigue. 

“You’ve been leading me a 
tough chase, Terry.” Carnaby 
grinned across at him. “I’m glad 
of a rest.” He noted the dark 
hollows under the lad’s eyes, the 
pallor of his cheeks. 

Sickle’s tongue came out and 
touched his lips. “Lieutenant — 
you made a try — a good try. 
Turn back now. It’s going to 
snow. You can’t make it to the 
top in a blizzard.” 

Carnaby shook his head. “It’s 
too late in the day to start down; 
you’d be caught on the slope. 
We’ll take it easy up to the 
Roost. In the morning you’ll have 
an easy climb down.” 



THUNDERHEAD 



25 



“Sure, Lieutenant. Don’t wor- 
ry about me.” Terry drew a 
breath, shivered with the bitter 
wind that plucked at his snow 
jacket, started upward. 

tflTThat do you mean, lost 
’ ’him!” the bull roar of 
the commodore rattled the 
screen. “Are you telling me that 
this rag-tag refugee has the 
capability to drop off the screens 
of the best equipped tracking 
deck in the fleet?” 

“Sir,” the stubborn-faced 
tracking officer repeated, “I can 
only report that my screens regis- 
ter nothing within the conic of 
search. If he’s there — ” 

“He’s there, Mister!” The 
Commodore’s eyes glared from 
under a bushy overhang of brows. 
“Find that bandit or face a court, 
Captain! I haven’t diverted a 
ship of the fleet line from her 
course for the purpose of becom- 
ing the object of an effectiveness 
inquiry!” 

The tracking officer turned 
away from the screen as it went 
white, met the quizzical gaze of 
the visiting signals lieutenant. 

“The old devil’s bit off too 
big a bite this time,” he growled. 
“Let him call a court; he 
wouldn’t have the gall.” 

“If we lose the bogie now, he 
won’t look good back on Vandy,” 
Pryor said. “This is serious 
business, diverting from cruise 



plan to chase rumors. I wonder 
if he really had a positive ID on 
this track.” 

“Hell, no! There’s no way to 
make a positive at this range, 
under these conditions! After 
three years without any action 
for the newstapes, the brass are 
grabbing at straws.” 

“Well, if I were you, Gordie, 
I’d find that track, even if it 
turns out to be a tramp with a 
load of bootleg dran.” 

“Don’t worry. If he’s inside 
the conic, I’ll find him.” 

CCT guess . it’s dropped 
-8- twenty degrees ... in the 
last hour.” Terry Sickle’s voice 
was almost lost in the shriek of 
the wind that buffeted the two 
men as they inched their way up 
the last yards toward the hut 
on the narrow rock shelf called 
Halliday’s Roost. 

“Never saw snow falling at 
this temperature before.” Car- 
naby brushed at the ice caked 
around his eyes. Through the 
swirl of crystals as fine as sand, 
he discerned the sagging outline 
of the shelter above. 

Ten minutes later, inside the 
crude lean-to built of rock slabs, 
he set to work chinking the gap- 
ing holes in the five foot walls 
with packed snow. Behind him, 
Terry lay huddled against the 
back wall, breathing hoarsely. 
“Guess .... I’m not in as 



26 



GALAXY 



good shape ... as I thought I 
was,” he said. 

“You’ll be okay, Terry.” Car- 
naby closed the gap through 
which the worst of the icy draft 
was keening, paused long enough 
to open a can of stew for the 
other. The fragrance of the hot 
meat and vegetables made his 
jaws ache. 

“Lieutenant, how are you go- 
ing to climb in this snow?” Sic- 
kle’s voice shook to the chatter- 
ing of his teeth. “In good weather, 
you might have made it. Like 
this, you haven’t got a chance!” 

“Maybe it’ll be blown clear 
by morning,” Carnaby said mild- 
ly. He opened a can for himself. 
Terry ate slowly, shivering un- 
controllably. Carnaby watched 
him worriedly. 

“Lieutenant,” the boy said, 
“even if that call you picked up 
was meant for you — even if 
this ship they’re after is headed 
out this way — what difference 
will it make one way or another 
if one beacon’s on the air or 
not?” 

“Probably none,” Carnaby 
said. “But if there’s one chance 
in a thousand he breaks this way 
— well, that’s what I’m here for, 
isn’t it?” 

“But what’s a beacon going 
to do, except give him something 
to steer by?” 

Carnaby smiled. “It’s not that 
kind of beacon, Terry. My sta- 



tion’s part of a system — a big 
system — that covers the surface 
of a sphere of space a hundred 
lights in diameter. When there’s 
an alert, each station locks in 
with the others that flank it and 
sets up what’s called a stressed 
field. There’s a lot of things you 
can do with this field. You can 
detect a drive, monitor com- 
munications — ” 

“What if these other stations 
you’re talking about aren’t work- 
ing?” Terry cut in. 

“Then my station’s not going 
to do much good,” Carnaby said. 

“If the other stations are still 
on the air, why haven’t any of 
them picked up your TX’s and 
answered?” 

Carnaby shook his head. “We 
don’t use the beacon field to 
chatter back and forth, Terry. 
This is a top security system. 
Nobody knows about it except 
the top command levels — and 
of course, the men manning the 
beacons.” 

“Maybe that’s how they came 
to forget about you. Somebody 
lost a piece of paper, and no- 
body else knew!” 

“I shouldn’t be telling you 
about it,” Carnaby said with a 
smile. “But I guess you’ll keep 
it under your hat.” 

“You can count on me, Lieu- 
tenant,” Terry said solemnly. 

“I know I can, Terry,” Car- 
naby said. 



THUNDERHEAD

UPhe clangor of the general 
■*“ quarters alarm shattered the 
tense silence of the chart deck 
like a bomb through a plate glass 
window. The navigation officer 
whirled abruptly from the gram- 
etric over which he had been 
bending, collided with the deck 
chief. Both men leaped for the 
master position monitor, caught 
just a glimpse of a vivid scarlet 
trace lancing toward the emerald 
point targeted at the center of the 
plate before the apparatus ex- 
ploded from its mounting, mow- 
ed the two men down in a hail 
of shattered plastic fragments. 

Smoke boiled, black and pun- 
gent, from the gutted cavity. The 
duty NCO, bleeding from a doz- 
en gashes, stumbled toward the 
two men, turned away in horror, 
reached an emergency voice 
phone. Before he could key it, 
the deck under him canted 
sharply. He screamed, clutched 
at a table for support, saw it 
tilt, came crashing down on top 
of him . 

On the message deck, Lieuten- 
ant Pryor clung to an operator’s 
stool, listening, through the stri- 
dency of the alarm bell, to the 
frantic voice from command 
deck: 

“All sections, all sections, com- 
bat stations! We’re under attack! 
My God, we’ve taken a hit — ” 



The voice cut off, to be re- 
placed by the crisp tones of 
Colonel Lancer, first battle offi- 
cer: 

“As you were. Section G-987 
and 989 damage control crews 
report! Forward armaments, 
safety interlocks off, stand by for 
firing orders! Message center, 
flash a code six to Fleet and 
TF Command. Power section, all 
selectors to gate, rig for full 
emergency power . ” 

Pryor hauled himself hand- 
over-hand to the main message 
console. The body of the code 
yeoman hung slackly in the seat 
harness, blood dripping from the 
fingertips of his dangling hand. 
Pryor freed him, took his place. 
He keyed the code six alarm into 
the pulse-relay tanks, triggered 
an emergency override signal, 
beamed the message outward to- 
ward the distant Fleet Head- 
quarters. 

On the command deck. Com- 
modore Broadly clutched a 
sprained wrist to his chest, stood, 
teeth bared, feet braced apart, 
staring into the forward image- 
screen at the dwindling point of 
light that was the Djann block- 
ade runner. 

“The effrontery of the damned 
scoundrel!” he roared. “Lancer, 
launch another covey of U-95’s! 
You’ve got over five hundred 
megaton/seconds of firepower, 
man! Use it!”

GALAXY 



“He’s out of range, Commo- 
dore,” Lancer said coolly. “He 
booby-trapped us very neatly.” 
“It’s your job to see that we 
don’t blunder into traps, by God, 
Colonel!” the commodore round- 
ed on the battle officer. “You’ll 
stop that pirate, or I’ll rip those 
eagles off your shoulders my- 
self!” 

Lancer’s mouth was a hard 
line; his eyes were ice chips. 

“You can relieve me, Commo- 
dore,” his voice grated. “Until 
you do, I’m battle commander 
aboard this vessel.” 

“By God, you’re relieved, sir!” 
Broadly yelled. He whirled on 
the startled exec standing by. 
“Confine this officer to his quar- 
ters! Order full emergency accel- 
eration! This vessel’s on Condi- 
tion Red at full combat alert un- 
til we overtake and destroy that 
sneaking snake in the grass!” 
“Commodore — at full emer- 
gency without warning, there’ll 
be men injured, even killed — ” 
“Carry out my commands, 
Captain, or I’ll find someone who 
will!” The admiral’s bellow cut 
off the exec. “I’ll show that filthy, 
sneaking pack of spiders what it 
means to challenge a Terran 
fighting ship!” 

On the power deck, Chief 
Powerman Joe Arena wiped the 
cut on his forehead, stared at the 
bloody rag, hurled it aside with 
a curse. 



“All right, you one-legged 
deck-apes!” he roared. You heard 
it! We’re going after the bandit, 
full gate, and if we melt our lin- 
ings down to slag, I’ll have every 
man of you sign a statement of 
charges that’ll take your grand- 
children two hundred years to 
pay off!” 

I n the near darkness of the 
Place of Observation aboard 
the Djann vessel, the ocular com- 
plex of the One-Who-Commands 
glowed with a dim red sheen as 
he studied the apparently black 
surface of the sensitive plate. 
“The Death-Watcher has eaten 
our energy weapon,” he com- 
municated to his three link-bro- 
thers. “Now our dooms are in 
the palms of the fate-spinner.” 
“The Death-Watcher of the 
Water-Beings might have passed 
us by,” the One-Who-Anticipates 
signaled. “It was an act of rash- 
ness to hurl the weapon at it.” 
“It will make a mighty 
song.” The One-Who-Records 
thrummed his resonator plates, 
tried a melancholy bass chord. 

“But what egg-carrier will 
exude the brood-nourishing hon- 
eys of strength and sagacity 
in response to these powerful 
rhymes, if the stimulus to their 
creation leads us to quick extinc- 
tion?” the One-Who-refutes que- 
ried. 

“In their own brief existence, 

29 



THUNDERHEAD 




these harmonies find their justifi- 
cation,” the One-Who-Records 
attested. 

“The Death-Watcher shake$ 
himself,” the One-Who-Com- 
mands stated. “Now he turns in 
pursuit.” 

The One-Who-Records emitted 
a booming tone. “Gone are the 
great suns of Djann,” he sang. 
“Lost are the fair worlds that 
knew their youth. But the spark 
of their existence glows still!” 
“Now we fall outward, toward 
the Great Awesomeness,” the 
One-Who-Anticipates comment- 
ed. “Only the blackness will know 
your song.” 

“Draw in your energies from 
that - which - is - extraneous,” the 
One-Who-Commands ordered. 
“Focus the full poignancy of your 
intellects on the urgency of our 
need for haste! All else is vain, 
now. Neither signer nor song will 
survive the vengeance of the 
Death-Watcher if he outstrips 
our swift flight!” 

“Though Djann and Water-Be- 
ing perish, my poem is eternal.” 
The One-Who-Records emitted 
a stirring assonance. “Fly, Djan- 
ni! Pursue, Death-Watcher! Let 
the suns observe how we comport 
ourselves in this hour!” 

“Exhort the remote nebulosi- 
ties to attend our plight, if you 
must,” the One-Who-refutes com- 
mented. “But link your energies 
to ours or all is lost!” 



GALAXY 




Silent now, the Djann priva- 
teer fled outward toward the 
Rim. 

VII 

C arnaby awoke, lay in darkness 
listening to the wheezing of 
Terry Sickle’s breath. The boy 
didn’t sound good. Carnaby sat 
up, suppressing a grunt at the 
stiffness of his limbs. The icy air 
seemed stale. He moved to the 
entry, lifted the polyon flap. A 
cascade of powdery snow poured 
in. Beyond the opening a faint 
glow filtered down through bank- 
ed snow. 

He turned back to Terry as the 
latter coughed deeply. 

“Looks like the snow’s quit,” 
Carnaby said. “It’s drifted pretty 
bad, but there’s no wind now. 
How are you feeling, Terry?” 
“Not so good, Lieutenant,” 
Sickle said weakly. He breathed 
heavily,, in and out. “I don’t know 
what’s got into me. Feel hot and 
cold at the same time.” 

Carnaby stripped off his glove, 
put his hand on Sickle’s forehead. 
It was scalding hot. 

“You just rest easy here for a 
while, Terry. There’s a couple 
more cans of stew and plenty of 
water. I’ll make it up to the top 
as quickly as I can. Soon as I 
get back, we’ll go down. With 
luck, I’ll have you to Doc Lin’s 
house by dark.” 



“I guess ... I guess I should 
have done like Doc said.” Terry’s 
voice was a thin whisper. 

“What do you mean?” 

“I been taking these hypo 
sprays. Two a day. He said I 
better not miss one, but ‘heck, I 
been feeling real good lately — ” 

“What kind of shots, Terry?” 
Carnaby’s voice was tight. 

“I don’t know. Heck, Lieuten- 
ant, I’m no invalid!” His voice 
trailed off. 

“You should have told me, 
Terry!” 

“Gosh, Lieutenant — don’t 
worry about me! I didn’t mean 
nothing! Hell, I feel . He 
broke off to cough deeply, rack- 
ingly. 

“Terry, Terry!” Carnaby put 
a hand on the boy’s thin shoul- 
der.” 

“I’m okay,” Sickle gasped. 
“It’s just asthma. It’s nothing.” 

“It’s nothing if you get your 
medicine on schedule,” Carnaby 
said. “But — ” 

“I butted in on this party, 
Lieutenant,” Terry said. “It’s my 
own fault ... if I come down 
sick.” He paused to draw a dif- 
ficult breath. “You go ahead, 
sir . do what you got to 
do . I’ll be okay.” 

I’ve got to get you back, 
Terry. But I’ve got to go up first,” 
Carnaby said. “You understand 
that, don’t you?” 

Terry nodded. “A man’s got 

31 



THUNDERHEAD 



to do his job . Lieutenant. 
I’ll be waiting . for you .. 
when you get back.” 

“Listen to me carefully, Ter- 
ry.” Carnaby’s voice was low. 
“If I’m not back by this time to- 
morrow, you’ll have to make it 
back down by yourself. You un- 
derstand? Don’t wait for me.” 
“Sure, Lieutenant, I’ll just rest 
a while. Then I’ll be okay.” 
“Sooner I get started, the soon- 
er I’ll be back.” Carnaby took a 
can from the pack, opened it, 
handed it to Terry. The boy 
shook his head. 

“You eat it, Lieutenant. You 
need your strength. I don’t feel 
like I . could eat anything any- 
way.” 

“Terry, I don’t want to have to 
pry your mouth open and pour 
it in.” 

“All right. But open one for 
yourself too.” 

“All right, Terry.” 

Sickle’s hand trembled as he 
spooned the stew to his mouth. 
He ate half of the contents of the 
can, then leaned back against the 
wall, closed his eyes. “That’s 
all ... I want . .” 

“All right, Terry. You get some 
rest now. I’ll be back before you 
know it.” Carnaby crawled out 
through the open pushed his way 
up through loosely drifted snow. 
The cold struck his face like a 
spiked club. He turned the suit 
control up another notch, notic- 



ing as he did that the left side 
seemed to be cooler than the 
right. 

The near-vertical rise of the 
final crown of the peak thrust 
up from the drift, dazzling white 
in the morning sun. Carnaby 
examined the rockface for twenty 
feet on either side of the hut, 
picked a spot where a deep crack 
angled upward, started the last 
leg of the climb. 

/\n the message deck, Lieutcn- 
ant Pryor frowned into the 
screen from which the saturnine 
features of Lieutenant Aaron 
gazed back sourly. 

“The commodore’s going to be 
unhappy about this,” Pryor said. 
“If you’re sure your extrapola- 
tion is accurate — ” 

“It’s as good as the data I got 
from plotting,” Aaron snapped. 
“The bogie’s over the make-or- 
break line; we’ll never catch him 
now. You know your trans-Ein- 
steinian physics as well as I do.” 

“I never heard of the Djann 
having anything capable of that 
kind of acceleration,” Pryor pro- 
tested. 

“You have now.” Aaron 
switched off and keyed command 
deck, passed his report to the 
exec, then sat back with a resign- 
ed expression to await the reac- 
tion. 

Less than a minute later, Com- 
modore Broadly’s irate face 



32 



GALAXY 



snapped into focus on the screen. 

“You’re the originator of this 
report?” he growled. 

“I did the extrapolation.” 
Aaron stared back at his com- 
manding officer. 

“You’re relieved for incompe- 
tence,” Broadly said in a tone as 
harsh as a handsaw. 

“Yes sir,” Aaron said. His face 
was pale, but he returned the 
commodore’s stare. “But my in- 
put data and comps are a matter 
of record. I’ll stand by them.” 
Broadly’s face darkened. “Are 
you telling me these spiders can 
spit in our faces and skip off, 
scot-free?” 

“All I’m saying, sir, is that the 
present acceleration ratios will 
put the target ahead of us by a 
steadily increasing increment.” 
Broadly’s face twitched. “This 
vessel is at full emergency gain!” 
he growled. “No Djann has ever 
outrun a fleet unit in a straight- 
away run.” 

“This one is . sir.” 

The commodore’s eyes bored 
into Aaron’s. “Remain on duty 
until further notice,” he said, and 
switched off. Aaron smiled crook- 
edly and buzzed the message 
deck. 

“He backed down,” he said to 
Pryor. “We’ve got a worried com- 
modore on board.” 

“I don’t understand it myself,” 
Pryor said. “How the hell is that 
can out-gaining us?” 

THUNDERHEAD 



“He’s not,” Aaron said com- 
placently. “From a standing start, 
we’d overhaul him in short order. 
But he got the jump on us by a 
couple of minutes, after he 
lobbed the fish into us. If we’d 
been able to close the gap in the 
first half hour or so, we’d have 
had him; but at trans-L veloci- 
ties, you get some strange effects. 
One of them is that our vectors 
become asymptotic. We’re closing 
on him — but we’ll never over- 
take him.” 

Pryor whistled. “Broadly could 
be busted for this fiasco.” 

“Uh-huh,” Aaron grinned. 
“Could be — unless the bandit 
stops for a quick one . 

After Aaron rang off, Pryor 
turned to study the position re- 
peater screen. On it Malthusa 
was represented by a bright point 
at the center, the fleeing Djann 
craft by a red dot above. 

“Charlie,” Pryor called the 
NCOIC. “That garble TX we 
picked up last watch; where did 
you R and D it?” 

“Right about here, Lieutenant.” 
The NCO flicked a switch and 
turned knobs; a green dot ap- 
peared near the upper edge of 
the screen. 

“Hey,” he said. “It looks like 
maybe our bandit’s headed out 
his way.” 

“You picked him up on Y- 
band. Have you tried to raise 
him again?” 

33 



“Yeah, but nothing doing, 
Lieutenant. It was just a fluke — ” 
“Get a Y-foeam on him, Char- 
lie. Focus it down to a cat’s whis- 
ker and work a pattern over a 
one degree radius centered 
around his MPP until you get an 
echo.” 

“If you say so, sir — but — ” 
“I do say so, Charlie! Find 
that transmitter, and the drinks 
are on me!” 

VIII 

'C'lat against the wind-swept 
* rockface, Carnaby clung with 
his fingertips to a tenuous hold, 
feeling with one booted toe for a 
purchase higher up. A flake of 
stone broke away, and for a mo- 
ment he hung by the fingers of 
his right hand, his feet dangling 
over emptiness; then, swinging 
his right leg far out, he hooked 
a knob with his knee, caught at 
a rocky rib with his free hand, 
pulled himself up to a more se- 
cure rest. He clung, his cheek 
against the iron-cold stone; out 
across the vast expanse of feature- 
less grayish-tan plain the gleam- 
ing whipped -cream shape of the 
next core rose, ten miles to the 
south. 

A wonderful view up here — 
of nothing. Funny to think it 
could be his last. He was out of 
condition. It had been too long 
since his last climb .... 

34 



But that wasn’t the way to 
think. He had a job to do — the 
first in twenty-one years. For a 
moment, ghostly recollections 
rose up before him: The trim 
Academy lawns, the spit-and- 
polish of inspection, the crisp 
feel of the new uniform, the glit- 
ter of the silver comet as Anne 
pinned it on . 

That was no good either. What 
counted was here: The station up 
above. One more push, and he’d 
be there. 

He rested for another half min- 
ute, then pulled himself up and 
forward, onto the relatively mild 
slope of the final approach to the 
crest. Fifty yards above, the dull- 
gleaming plastron-coated dome of 
the beacon station squatted 
against the exposed rock, look- 
ing no different than it had five 
years earlier. 

Five minutes later, he was at 
the door, flicking the combina- 
tion latch dial with cold-numbed 
fingers. 

Tumblers clicked, and the pan- 
el slid aside. The heating system, 
automatically reacting to his 
entrance, started up with a busy 
hum to bring the interior temp- 
erature up to comfort level. 
He pulled off his gauntlets, ran 
his hands over his face, rasping 
the stubble there. There was cof- 
fee in the side table, he remem- 
bered. Fumblingly, with stiff fin- 
gers, he got out the dispenser, 

GALAXY 



twisted the control cap, poured 
out a steaming mug, gulped it 
down. It was hot and bitter. The 
grateful warmth of it made him 
think of Terry, waiting down be- 
low in the chill of the half-ruined 
hut. 

“No time to waste,” he mutter-, 
ed to himself. He stamped up and 
down the room, swinging his arms 
to warm himself, then seated 
himself at the console, flicked 
keys with a trained ease render- 
ed only slightly rusty by the 
years of disuse. He referred to 
an index, found the input instruc- 
tions for Code Gamma Eight, set 
up the boards, flipped in the 
Pulse lever. Under his feet, he 
felt the faint vibration as the 
power pack buried in the rock 
stored its output for ten micro- 
seconds, fired it in a single milli- 
second burst, stored and pulsed 
again. Dim instrument lights 
winked on, indicating normal 
readings all across the board. 

Carnaby glanced at the wall 
clock. He had been here ten min- 
utes now. It would take another 
quarter hour to comply with the 
manual’s instructions — but to 
hell with that gobbledegook. He’d 
put the beacon on the air; this 
time the Navy would have to 
settle for that. It would be push- 
ing it to get back to the boy and 
pack him down to the village by 
nightfall as it was. Poor kid; he’d 
wanted to help so badly . 

THUNDERHEAD 



C inphat’s correct, sir,” Pryor 
said crisply. “I haven’t 
picked up any come-back on my 
pulse, but I’ll definitely identify 
the echo as coming from a JN 
type installation.” 

Commodore Broadly nodded 
curtly. “However, inasmuch as 
your instruments indicate that 
this station is operating solo — 
not linked in with a net to set up 
a defensive field — it’s of no use 
to us.” The commodore looked 
at Pryor coldly. 

“I think perhaps there’s a way, 
sir,” Pryor said. “The Djann are 
known to have strong tribal feel- 
ings. They’d never pass up what 
they thought was an SOS from 
one of their own. Now, suppose 
we signal this JN station to 
switch over to the Djann fre- 
quencies and beam one of their 
own signal-patterns at them. 
They just might stop to take a 
look . .” 

“By God!” Broadly looked at 
the signals lieutenant. “If he 
doesn’t, he’s not human!” 

“You like the idea, sir?” Pryor 
grinned. 

“A little rough on the beacon 
station if they reach it before we 
do, eh, Lieutenant? I imagine our 
friends the Djann will be a trifle 
upset when they learn they’ve 
been duped.” 

“Oh . .” Pryor loked blank. 
“I guess I hadn’t thought of that, 
sir.” 

35 



“Never mind,” Broadly said 
briskly. “The loss of a minor in- 
stallation such as this is a reason- 
able exchange for an armed vessel 
of the enemy.” 

“Well 

“Lieutenant, if I had a few 
more officers aboard who em- 
ployed their energies in some- 
thing other than assembling sta- 
tistics proving we’re beaten, this 
cruise might have made a record 
for itself — ” Broadly cut him- 
self off, remembering the degree 
of aloofness due every junior of- 
ficers — even juniors who may 
have raked some very hot chest- 
nuts out of the fire. 

“Carry on, Lieutenant,” he 
said. “If this works out, I think 
I can promise you a very favor- 
able endorsement on your next 
ER.” 

As Pryor’s pleased grin winked 
off the screen, the commodore 
flipped up the red line key, 
snapped a brusque request at the 
bored log room yeoman. 

“This will make Old Carbuncle 
sing another tune,” he remarked 
almost gaily to the Exec, stand- 
ing by with a harassed expres- 
sion. 

“Maybe you’d better go slow, 
Ned,” the latter cautioned, gaug- 
ing his senior’s mood. “It might 
be as well to get a definite con- 
firmation on this installation’s 
capabilities before we go on rec- 
ord — ” 



Broadly turned abruptly to the 
screen as it chimed. “Admiral, as 
I reported, I’ve picked up one of 
our forward beacon towers,” 
Broadly’s hearty voice addressed 
the screen from which the grim 
visage of the task force comman- 
der eyed him. “I’m taking steps 
to complete the intercept that are, 
if I may say so, rather ingenious.” 
“It’s my understanding the tar- 
get is receding on an I-curve, 
Broadly,” the admiral said flatly. 
“I’ve been anticipating a Code 
thirty-three from you.” 

“Break off action?” Broadly’s 
jaw dropped. “Now, Tom — ” 

6iTt’s a little irregular to use a 
capital ship of the line to 
chase a ten-thousand-ton yacht.” 
The task force commander 
ignored the interruption. “I can 
understand your desire to break 
the monotony with a little activi- 
ty; good exercise for the crew, 
too. But at the rate the signal is 
attenuating, it’s apparent you’ve 
lost her.” His voice hardened. 
“I’m beginning to wonder if 
you’ve forgotten that your as- 
signment is the containment of 
enemy forces supposedly pinned 
down under tight quarantine!” 
“This yacht, as you put it, Ad- 
miral, blew two of my detached 
units out of space!” Broadly 
came back hotly. “In addition, 
he planted a missile squarely in 
my fore lazaret — ” 



36 



GALAXY 



“I’m not concerned with the 
details of your operation at this 
moment, Commodore.” The other 
bit off the words like bullets. 
“I’m more interested in main- 
taining the degree of surveillance 
over my assigned quadrant that 
Concordiat security requires. Ac- 
cordingly — ” 

“Just a minute, Tom, before 
you commit yourself!” Broadly’s 
florid face was pale around the 
ears. “Perhaps you failed to catch 
my first remark : I have a forward 
station directly in the enemy’s 
line of retreat. The intercept is in 
the bag — unless you counter- 
mand me.” 

“You’re talking nonsense! The 
target’s well beyond the Inner 
Line.” 

“He’s not beyond the Outer 
Line!” 

The Admiral frowned. His 
tight, well-chiseled face was still 
youthful under the mask of au- 
thority. “The system was never 
extended into the region under 
discussion,” he said harshly. “I 
suggest you recheck your instru- 
ments. In the interim, I want to 
see an advice of a course-correc- 
tion for station in the length of 
time it takes you to give the 
necessary orders to your naviga- 
tion section.” 

Broadly drew a breath, hesi- 
tated. If Old Carbuncle was right 
— if that infernal signals lieu- 
tenant had made a mistake — 



but the boy seemed definite 
enough about it. He clamped his 
jaw. He’d risked his career on a 
wild throw; maybe he’d acted a 
little too fast; maybe he’d been 
a little too eager to grab a chance 
at some favorable notice; but the 
die was cast now. If he turned 
back empty-handed the entire af- 
fair would go into the record as 
a major fiasco. But if this scheme 
worked out .... 

“Unless the admiral wishes to 
make that a direct order,” he 
heard himself saying firmly, “I 
intend to hold my course and 
close with the enemy. It’s my 
feeling that neither the admiral- 
ty nor the general public will en- 
joy hearing of casualties inflicted 
by a supposedly neutralized en- 
emy who was then permitted to 
go his way unhindered.” He re- 
turned the other’s stare, feeling a 
glow of pride at his own decisive- 
ness and a simultaneous sinking 
sensation at the enormity of the 
insubordination. 

The vice admiral looked back 
at him through narrowed eyes. 
“I’ll leave that decision to you, 
Commodore,” he said tightly. “I 
think you’re as aware as I of 
what’s at stake here.” 

Broadly stiffened at what was 
almost an open threat. “Instruct 
your signals officer to pass full 
information on this supposed sta- 
tion to me immediately,” the sen- 
ior concluded curtly and then dis- 



THUNDERHEAD

appeared from view on the screen. 

Broadly turned away, feeling 
all eyes on him. “Tell Pryor to 
copy his report to G at once,” he 
said in a harsh voice. His eyes 
strayed to the exec’s. “And if this 
idea of his doesn’t work out, God 
help him.” And all of us, he 
added under his breath. 

\ s Carnaby reached for the 
door, to start the long climb 
down, a sharp beep! sounded 
from the panel behind him. 

He looked back, puzzled. The 
bleat repeated, urgent, command- 
ing. He swung the pack down, 
went to the console, flipped 
down the REC key. 

“. 37 Ace Trey,” an ex- 
cited voice came through loud 
and clear. “I repeat, cut your 
beacon immediately! JN37 Ace 
Trey, Cincsec One-oh-four to 
JN37 Ace Trey. Shut down bea- 
con soonest! This is an Opera- 
tional Urgent! JN37 Ace Trey, 
cut beacon and stand by for fur- 
ther operational urgent instruc- 
tions 

IX 

An the fleet command Deck 
^ aboard the flagship, Vice- 
Admiral Thomas Carnaby, other- 
wise known as Old Carbuncle, 
studied the sector triagram as his 
Communications Chief pointed 
out the positions of the flagship, 

38 



Malthusa, the Djann refugee and 
the reported JN beacon station. 

“I’ve researched the call let- 
ters, sir,” the gray-haired signals 
major said. “They’re not shown 
on any listing as an active sta- 
tion. In fact, the entire series 
of which this station would be a 
part is coded null ; never reported 
in commission.” 

“So someone appears to be 
playing pranks, is that your con- 
clusion, Henry?” 

The signals officer pulled at his 
lower lip. “No, sir, not that, pre- 
cisely. I’ve done a full analytical 
on the recorded signal that young 
Pryor first intercepted. It’s plain- 
ly directed to Cincsec in response 
to the alert; and the ID is con- 
firmed. Now, as I say, this series 
was dropped from the register. 
But at one time, such a designa- 
tion was assigned en bloc to a 
proposed link in the Out-line. 
However, the planned installa- 
tions never came to fruition due 
to changes in the strategic posi- 
tion.” 

The vice-admiral frowned. 
“What changes were those?” 

“The task force charged with 
the establishment of the link en- 
countered heavy enemy pressure. 
In fact, the cruiser detailed to 
carry out the actual placement 
of the units was lost in action 
with all hands. Before the pro- 
gram could be re-initiated, a 
withdrawal from the sector was 



GALAXY 



ordered. The new link was never 
completed, and the series was re- 
tired, unused.” 

“So?” 

“So . just possibly, sir, one 
of those old stations was erected 
before Redoubt was lost — ” 

“What’s that?” The admiral 
rounded on the startled officer. 
“Did you say . Redoubt.” His 
voice was a hiss between set 
teeth. 

“Y — yessir!” 

“Redoubt was lost with all 
hands before she planted her first 
station!” 

“I know that’s what we’ve al- 
ways thought, Admiral — ” 

The Admiral snatched the 
paper from the major’s hand. 
“JN37 Ace-Trey,” he read aloud. 
“Why the hell didn’t you say 
so sooner?” He whirled to his 
chief of staff. 

“What’s Broadly got in mind?” 
he snapped the question. 

The startled officer began a 
description of the plan to de- 
coy the Djann vessel into range 
of Malthusa’s batteries. 

“Decoy'?” the vice admiral 
snarled. The exec took a step 
backward, shocked at the ex- 
pression on his superior’s face. 
The latter spun to face his bat- 
tle officer, standing by on the 
bridge. 

“General, rig out an interceptor 
and get my pressure gear into 
it! I want it on the line ready for 
THUMDERHEAD 



launch in ten minutes! Assign 
your best torohman as co-pilot!” 
“Yessir!” The general spoke 
quickly into a lapel mike. The 
admiral flicked a key beside the 
hot-line screen. 

“Get Broadly,” he said in a 
voice like doom impending. 

I n the Djann ship, the One- 
Who-Commands stirred and 
extended a contact to his crew- 
members. “Tune keenly in the 
scarlet regions of the spectrum,” 
he communicated. “And tell me 
whether the spinners weave a 
new thread in the tapestry of our 
fates.” 

“I sensed it but now and felt 
recognition stir within me!” the 
mighty euphony. “A voice of the 
One-Who-Records thrummed a 
Djann, sore beset, telling of mor- 
tal need!” 

“I detect a strangeness,” the 
One -Who -Refutes indicated. 
“This is not the familiar voice 
of They-Who-Summon.” 

“After the passage of ninety 
cycles, it is not surprising that 
new chords have been added to 
the voice and others withdrawn,” 
the One-Who-Anticipates point- 
ed out. “If the link-cousins are 
in distress, our path is clear!” 
“Shall I then bend our fate- 
line to meet the new voice?” the 
One-Who-Commands called for 
a weighing. “The pursuers press 
us closely.” 

“The voice calls. Will we per- 

39 



vert our saga by shunning it?” 

“This is a snare of the Water- 
Beings, calculated to abort our 
destinies!” The One- Who -Refutes 
warned. “Our vital energies are 
drained to the point of incipient 
coma by the weapon-which- 
feeds-on-life! If we turn aside 
now, we place ourselves in the 
jaws of the destroyer!” 

“Though the voice lies, the 
symmetry of our existence de- 
mands that we answer its ap- 
peal,” the One-Who-Anticipates 
declared. 

“Go to it,” The One-Who- 
Records sounded a booming ar- 
peggio, combining triumph and 
defeat. “Let the Djann flame 
burn brightest in its hour of ex- 
tinction!” 

44j3y God, they’ve fallen for 

A3 }t!” Commodore Broadly 
smacked his fist into his hand 
and beamed at the young signals 
lieutenant. He rocked back on 
his heels, studying the position 
chart the plot officer had set 
up for him on the message deck. 
“We’ll make the intercept about 
here.” His finger stabbed at a 
point a fractional light from the 
calculated position of the new- 
found OL station. 

He broke off as an excited 
voice burst from the intercom 
screen. 

“Commodore Broadly, sir! 
Urgent from task — ” The yeo- 
man’s face disappeared from the 

40 



screen to be replaced by the 
fierce visage of the vice-admiral. 

“Broadly, sheer off and take 
up course for station and then 
report yourself under arrest! 
Commodore Baskov will take 
command: I’ve countermanded 
your damned-fool orders to the 
OL station! I’m on my way out 
there now to see what I can sal- 
vage — and when I get back, I’m 
preferring charges against you 
that will put you on the beach 
for the rest of your miserable 
life!” 

X 

I n the beacon station atop the 
height of ground known as 
Thunderhead, Carnaby waited 
before the silent screen. The mod- 
ification to the circuitry had tak- 
en half an hour; setting up the 
new code sequences, another fif- 
teen minutes. Then another half 
hour had passed, while the con- 
verted beacon beamed out the 
alien signal. 

He’d waited long enough. It 
had been twenty minutes now 
since the last curt order to stand 
by; and in the hut a thousand 
feet below, Terry had been wait- 
ing now for nearly five hours, 
every breath he drew a torture 
of strangulation. The order had 
been to put the signal on the 
air, attempt to delay the enemy 
' ship. Either it had worked, or it 

GALAXY 



hadn’t. If Fleet had any more 
instructions for him, they’d have 
to damn well deliver them in 
person. He’d done what was re- 
quired. Now he had to see to 
the boy. 

Carnaby rose, again donned 
the back-pack, opened the door. 
As he did so, a faint, deep-toned 
rumble of distant thunder rolled. 
He stepped outside, squinted up 
at the sky, a dazzle of mist-gray, 
maybe the snow squall was 
headed back this way. That 
would be bad luck; it would be 
dose enough as it was. 

A bright point of light caught 
his eye, winking from high above, 
almost at zenith. 

Carnaby felt his heart take a 
leap in his chest that almost 
choked off his breath. For a 
moment he stood, staring up at 
it; then he whirled back through 
the door. 

“ . termand previous in- 
structions!” A new voice was 
rasping from the speaker. “Term- 
inate all transmissions immedi- 
ately! JN37, shut down power 
and vacate station! Repeat, an 
armed enemy vessel is believed to 
be vectored in on your signal! 
This is, repeat, a hostile vessel! 
You are to cease transmission 
and abandon station immediate- 
ly — ” 

Carnaby’s hand slapped the big 
master lever. Lights died on the 
panel. Underfoot, the minute 



vibration jelled into immobili- 
ty. Sudden silence pressed in. like 
a tangible force — a silence 
broken by a rising mutter from 
above. 

“Like that, eh?” Carnaby said 
to himself through clenched 
teeth. “Abandon station, eh?” He 
took three steps to a wall locker, 
yanked the door wide, took out 
a short, massive power rifle, still 
encased in its plastic protective 
cover. He stripped the oily 
sheath away, checked the charge 
indicator; it rested on FULL. 

There were foot-square win- 
dows set on each side of the 
twenty-foot room. Carnaby went 
to one. By putting his face flat 
against the armorplast panel he 
was able to see the ship, now 
a flaring fireball dropping in 
along a wide approach curve. As 
it descended swiftly, the dark 
body of the vessel took shape 
above the glare of the drive. It 
was a small, blunt-ended ovoid 
of unfamiliar design, a metallic 
black in color, decorated fore and 
aft with the scarlet blazons of 
a Djann war vessel. 

The ship was close now, ma- 
neuvering to a position a thou- 
sand feet directly overhead. Now 
a small landing craft detached 
itself from the parked ship and 
plummeted downward like a 
stone with a shrill whistling of 
highspeed rotors, to settle in 
across the expanse- of broken 



THUNDERHEAD 



41 



rock in a cloud of pale dust. The 
black plastic bubble atop the 
landing sled split like a clam- 
shell. 

A shape came into view, clam- 
bered over the cockpit rim and 
stood, a cylindrical bronze-black 
body slung by leather mesenter- 
ies from the paired U frames that 
were its ambulatory members, 
two pairs of grasping limbs fold- 
ed above. 

A second Djann emerged, a 
third, a fourth. They stood to- 
gether, immobile, silent, while a 
minute ticked past. Sweat tric- 
kled down the side of Carnaby’s 
face. He breathed shallowly, 
rapidly, feeling the almost pain- 
ful thudding of his heart. They’d 
ordered him to delay the enemy; 
well, he’d delay them .... 

rf^\ne of the Djann moved sud- 
denly, its strange, jointless 
limbs moving with twinkling 
grace and speed. It flowed across 
to a point from which it could 
look down across the plain, then 
angled to the left and recon- 
noitered the entire circumference 
of the mountain top. Carnaby 
moved from window to window 
to watch it. It rejoined the other 
three; briefly, they seemed to 
confer. Then one of the crea- 
tures, whether the same one or 
another Carnaby wasn’t sure, 
started across toward the hut. 

Carnaby moved back into a 



position in the lee of a switch 
gear cabinet. A moment later the 
Djann appeared at the door. At 
a distance of fifteen feet, Carna- 
by saw the lean limbs, like 
leather-covered metal; the heavy 
body; the immense faceted eyes 
that caught the light and sent 
back fiery glints. For thirty 
seconds the creature scanned the 
interior of the structure. Then 
it withdrew. 

Carnaby let out a long, shaky 
breath, watched it lope back to 
rejoin its companions. Again, the 
Djann conferred; then one turned 
to the landing craft. 

For a long moment Carnaby 
hesitated. He could stay where 
he was, do nothing, and the 
Djann would reboard their ves- 
sel and go their way; and in a 
few hours a fleet unit would 
heave into view off Longone, and 
he’d be home safe. 

But the orders had been to 
delay the enemy .... 

He centered the sights of the 
power gun on the alien’s body, 
just behind the fore-legs, and 
pushed the firing stud. 

A shaft of purple fire blew the 
window from its frame, lanced 
out to smash the up-rearing alien 
against the side of the sled, sent 
it skidding in a splatter of molten 
rock and metal. Carnaby swung 
the rifle, fired at a second Djann 
as the group scattered; the strick- 
en creature went down, rolled, 



42 



GALAXY 




came up, stumbling on three 
limbs. He fired again, knocked 
the creature spinning, dark fluid 
spattering from a gaping wound 
in the barrel-like body. Carnaby 
swung to cover a third Djann, 
streaking for the plateau’s edge; 
his shot sent a shower of molten 
slag arcing high from the spot 
where it disappeared. 

He lowered the gun, stepped 
outside, ran to the corner of the 
building. The fourth Djann was 
crouched in the open, thirty feet 
away; Carnaby saw the glitter of 
a weapon gripped in the hand- 
like members springing from its 
back. He brought the gun up, 
fired in the same instant that light 
etched the rocks, and a hammer- 
blow struck him crushingly in the 
side, knocked him back against 
the wall. He tasted dust in his 
mouth, was aware of a high, hum- 
ming sound that seemed to blank 
out his hearing, his vision, his 
thoughts .... 

He came to, lying on his side 
against the wall. Forty feet away, 
the Djann sprawled, its stiff limbs 
out-thrust at awkward angles. 
Carnaby looked down at his side. 

The Djann particle-gun had 
torn a gaping rent in his suit, 
through which he could see bright 
crimson beads of frozen blood. 
He groped, found the rifle, drag- 
ged it to him. He shook his head 
to clear away the mist that seem- 
ed to obscure his vision. At every 



THUNDERHEAD 



move, a terrible sharp pain 
stabbed outward from his chest. 
Ribs broken, he thought. Some- 
thing smashed inside, too. It was 
hard for him to breathe. The cold 
stone on which he lay seemed to 
suck the heat from his body. 

Across the hundred foot stretch 
of frost-shattered rock, a soot- 
black scar marked the spot where 
the escaping Djann had gone over 
the edge. Painfully, Carnaby 
propped the weapon to cover the 
direction from which attack 
might come. Then he slumped, 
his face against the icy rock, 
watching down the length of the 
rifle barrel for the next move 
from the enemy. 

C4 A nother four hours to shift, 
Admiral,” said General 
Drew, the battle commander 
acting as co-pilot aboard the rac- 
ing interceptor. “That’s if we 
don’t blow our linings before 
then.” 

“Bandit still holding posi- 
tion?” The admiral’s voice was 
a grate as of metal against metal. 

Drew spoke into his lip mike, 
frowned at the reply. “Yes, sir, 
Malthusa says he’s still station- 
ary. Whether his focus is identi- 
cal with the LN beacon’s fix or 
not, he isn’t sure at that range.” 

“He could be standing by off- 
planet, looking over the ground,” 
the admiral muttered half to him- 
self. 



“Not likely, Admiral. He knows 
we’re on his tail.” 

“I know it’s not likely, damn 
it!” the admiral snarled. “But if 
he isn’t, we haven’t got a chance.” 
“I suppose the Djann concep- 
tion of honor requires these beg- 
gars to demolish the beacon and 
hunt down the station person- 
nel, even if it means letting us 
overhaul them,” Drew said. “A 
piece of damn foolishness on their 
part, but fortunate for us.” 

“For us, General? I take it you 
mean yourself and me, not the 
poor devil that’s down there 
alone with them!” 

“Just the one man? Well, we’ll 
get off more cheaply than I 
imagined.” The general glanced 
sideways at the admiral, intent 
over the controls. “After all, he’s 
Navy. This is his job, what he 
signed on for.” 

“Kick the converter again, 
General,” Admiral Carnaby said 
between his teeth. “Right now 
you can earn your pay by 
squeezing another quarterlight 
out of this bucket.” 

/'"''Touched in a shallow crevice 
below the rim of the mesa 
where the house of the Water- 
Beings stood, the One-Who- 
Records quivered under the ap- 
palling impact of the death- 
emanations of his link-brothers. 

“Now it lies with you alone,” 
the fading thought came from the 



44 



GALAXY 



One-Who-Commands. “But the 
Water-Being, too, is alone, and 
in this . there is ... a certain 
euphony . .” The last fragile 
tendril of communication faded. 

The One-Who-Records expell- 
ed a gust of the planet’s noxious 
atmosphere from his ventral ori- 
fice-array, with an effort freed his 
intellect of the shattering extinc- 
tion-resonances it had absorbed. 
Cautiously, he probed outward, 
sensing the strange, fiery mind- 
glow of the alien .... 

Ah. he too was injured! The 
One-Who-Records shifted his 
weight from his scalded fore- 
limb, constricted further the flow 
of vital fluids through the dam- 
aged section of his epidermal 
system. He was weakened by the 
searing blast that had scored his 
flank, but still capable of action; 
and up above, the wounded 
Water-Being waited. 

Deftly, the Djann extracted the 
hand-weapon from the sheath 
strapped to his side, holding it in 
a two-handed grip, its broad base 
resting on his dorsal ridge, its 
ring-lenses aligned along his 
body. He wished briefly that he 
had spent more li periods in the 
peril-tanks, impressing the weap- 
on’s use-syndromes on his reflex 
system ; but reckless regrets made 
poor scansion. Now indeed the 
display-podium of existence nar- 
rowed down to a single confronta- 
tion: A brief and final act in a 



century-old drama, with the fate 
of the mighty epic of Djann rest- 
ing thereon. The One-Who- 
records sounded a single, trum- 
pet-like resonance of exultation 
and moved forward to fulfill his 
destiny. 

XI 

A t the faint bleat of sound, Car- 
naby raised his head. How 
long had he lain here, waiting 
for the alien to make its move? 
Maybe an hour, maybe longer. 
He had passed out at least twice, 
possibly for no more than a sec- 
ond or two; but it could have 
been longer. The Djann might 
even have gotten past 'him — or 
crawled along below the ridge, 
ready now to jump him from a 
new angle .... 

He thought of Terry Sickle, 
waiting for him, counting on him. 
Poor kid; time was running out 
for him. The sun was dropping 
low, and the shadows would be 
closing in. It would be ice cold 
inside the hut; and down there 
in the dark the boy was slowly 
strangling, maybe calling for 
him .... 

He couldn’t wait any longer. 
To hell with the alien. He’d held 
him long enough. Painfully, us- 
ing the wall as a support, Car- 
naby got to his hands and knees. 
His side felt as though it had 
been opened and packed with 



THUNDERHEAD 



45 



red-hot stones — or were they 
ice-cold? His hands and feet 
were numb. His face ached. 
Frostbite. He’d look fine with a 
frozen ear. Funny how vanity 
survived as long as life itself .... 

He got to his feet, leaned 
against the building, worked on 
breathing. The sky swam past 
him, fading and brightening. His 
feet felt like blocks of wood; 
that wasn’t good. He had a long 
way to go. But the activity would 
warm him, get the blood flowing, 
except where the hot stones were. 
He would be lighter if he could 
leave them here. His hands mov- 
ed at his side, groping over torn 
polyon, the sharp ends of broken 
wires .... 

He brought his mind back to 
clarity with an effort. Wouldn’t 
do to start wandering now. The 
gun caught his eye, lying at his 
feet. Better pick it up; but to 
hell with it, too much trouble. 
Navy property. Can’t leave it 
here for the enemy to find. Ene- 
my. Funny dream about a walk- 
ing oxy tank, and — 

He was looking at the dead 
Djann, lying, awkward, impossi- 
ble, thirty feet away. No dream. 
The damn things were real. He 
was here, alone, on top of Thun- 
derhead — 

But he couldn’t be. Flitter was 
broken down. Have to get an- 
other message off via the next 
tramp steamer that made planet- 



fall. Hadn’t been one for . 
how long? 

Something moved, a hundred 
feet away, among the tumble of 
broken rock. 

Carnaby ducked, came up with 
the blast-rifle, fired in a half- 
crouch from the hip, saw a big 
dark shape scramble up and over 
the edge, saw the wink of yellow 
light, fired again, cursing the 
weakness that made the gun buck 
and yaw in his hands, the dark- 
ness that closed over his vision. 
With hands that were stiff, clum- 
sy, he fired a third time at the 
swift-darting shape that charged 
toward him ; and then he was fall- 
ing, falling .... 

Qtunned by the direct hit from 
^ the energy weapon of the 
Water-Being, the One-Who-Re- 
cords fought his way upward 
through a universe shot through 
with whirling shapes of fire, to 
emerge on a plateau of mortal 
agony. 

He tried to move, was shocked 
into paralysis by the cacophony 
of conflicting motor and sense 
impressions from shattered limbs 
and organs. 

Then I, too, die, the thought 
came to him with utter finality. 
And with me dies the once- 
mighty song of Djann. 

Failing, his mind groped out- 
ward, calling in vain for the fami- 
liar touch of his link-brothers — 



46 



GALAXY 



and abruptly, a sharp sensation 
impinged on his sensitivity-com- 
plex. Concepts of strange and 
alien shape drifted into his mind, 
beating at him with compelling 
urgency from a foreign brain: 

Youth, aspirations, the ringing 
bugle of the call-to-arms. A 
white palace rearing up into yel- 
low sunlight; a bright banner, 
rippling against blue sky, and 
the> shadows of great trees rank- 
ed on green lawns. The taste of 
grapes, and an odor of flowers; 
night, and the moon reflected 
from still water; the touch of 
a soft hand and the face of a 
woman, invested with a supernal 
beauty; chords of a remote music 
that spoke of the inexpressibly 
desirable, the irretrievably lost . 

“Have we warred then, Water- 
Beings?” the One-Who-Records 
sent his thought outward. “We 
who might have been brothers?” 
With a mighty effort, he sum- 
moned his waning strength, 
sounded a final chord in tribute 
to that which had been. 

f Carnaby opened his eyes and 
looked at the dead Dj ann 
lying in the crumpled posture 
of its final agony, not six feet 
from him. For a moment, a cur- 
ious sensation of loss plucked 
at his mind. 

“Sorry, fellow,” he muttered 
aloud. “I guess you were doing 
what you had to do, too.”' 



He stood, felt the ground 
sway under his feet. His head 
was light, hot; a sharp, clear 
humming sounded in his ears. He 
took a step, caught himself as 
his knees tried to buckle. 

“Damn it, no time to fall out 
now,” he grunted. He moved past 
the alien body, paused by the 
door to the shed. A waft of warm 
air caressed his cold-numbed 
face. 

“Could go inside,” he muttered. 
“Wait there. Ship along in a few 
hours, maybe. Pick me up ... ” 
He shook his head angrily. “Job’s 
not done yet,” he said clearly, 
addressing the white gleam of 
the ten mile distant peak known 
as Cream-top. “Just a little long- 
er, Terry,” he added. “I’m com- 
ing.” 

Painfully, Carnaby made his 
way to the edge of the plateau, 
pulled himself up and over and 
started down. 

U W e ’ d k e ^ er shift to sub-L 
' ' now, Admiral,” Drew 
said, strain showing in his voice. 
“We’re cutting it fine as it is.” 

“Every extra minute at full 
gain saves a couple of hours,” 
the vice-admiral came back. 

“That won’t help us if we kick 
out inside the Delta limit and 
blow ourselves into free ions,” 
the general said coolly. 

“You’ve made your point. 
General!” The admiral kept his 



THUNDERHEAD 



47 



eyes fixed on his instruments. 
Half a minute ticked past. Then 
he nodded curtly. 

“All right, kick us out,” he 
snapped, “and we’ll see where we 
stand.” 

The hundred-ton interceptor 
shuddered as the distorters whin- 
ed down the scale, allowing the 
stressed space field that had en- 
closed the vessel to collapse. A 
star swam suddenly into the visi- 
ble spectrum, blazing at planet- 
ary distance off the starboard 
bow at three o’clock high. 

“Our target’s the second body, 
there.” The co-pilot punched the 
course into the panel. 

“What would you say, another 
hour?” The admiral bit off the 
words. 

“Make it two,” the other re- 
plied shortly. He glanced up, 
caught the admiral’s eye on him. 

“Kidding ourselves won’t 
change anything,” he said stead- 
ily. 

Admiral Carnaby narrowed his 
eyes, opened his mouth to speak, 
then clamped his jaw shut. 

“I guess I’ve been a little 
snappy with you, George,” he 
said. “I’ll ask your pardon. That’s 
my brother down there.” 

“Your . ?” the general’s 
features tightened. “I guess I 
said some stupid things myself, 
Tom.” He frowned at the in- 
struments, busied himself adjust- 
ing course for an MIT approach. 



/Carnaby half jumped, half fell 
the last few yards to the 
narrow ledge called Halliday’s 
Roost, landed awkwardly in a 
churn of powdered wind -driven 
snow. For a moment he lay 
sprawled, then gathered himself, 
made it to his feet, tottered to 
the hollow concealing the drifted 
entrance to the hut. He lowered 
himself, crawled down into the 
dark, clammy interior. 

“Terry,” he called hoarsely. A 
wheezing breath answered him. 
He felt his way to the boy’s side, 
groped over him. He lay on his 
side, his legs curled against his 
chest. 

“Terry!” Carnaby pulled the 
lad to a sitting position, he felt 
him stir feebly. “Terry, I’m back! 
We have to go now, Terry . .” 

“I knew — ” the boy stopped 
to draw an agonizing breath — 
“you’d come . ...” He groped, 
found Carnaby’s hand. 

Carnaby fought the dizziness 
that threatened to close in on 
him. 

He was cold — colder than 
he had ever been. The climbing 
hadn’t warmed him. The side 
wasn’t bothering him much now; 
he could hardly feel it. But he 
couldn’t feel his hands and feet, 
either. They were like stumps, 
good for nothing .... Clumsily, 
he backed through the entry, 
bodily hauling Terry along with 
him. 



48

Outside, the wind lashed at 
him like frozen whips. Carnaby 
raised Terry to his feet. The boy 
leaned against him, slid down, 
crumpled to the ground. 

“Terry, you’ve got to try,” Car- 
naby gasped out. His breath 
seemed to freeze in his throat. 
“No time to waste . got to 
get you to . Doc Lin . .” 

“Lieutenant . I . can’t 

99 

“Terry . you’ve got to try!” 
He lifted the boy to his feet. 

“I’m . scared . Lieuten- 
ant . ” Terry stood swaying, 
his slight body quivering, his 
knees loose. 

“Don’t worry, Terry.” Carna- 
by guided the boy to the point 
from which they would start the 
climb down. “Not far now.” 

“Lieutenant . ” Sickler 
caught at Carnaby’s arm, clung. 
“You . better . leave . 
me.” 

His breath sighed in his 
throat. 

“I’ll go first.” Carnaby heard 
his own voice as from a great 
distance. “Take ... it easy. I’ll 
be right there ... to help ...” 

He forced a breath of sub-zero 
air into his lungs. The bitter wind 
moaned around the shattered 
rock. The dusky afternoon sun 
shed a reddish light but no heat 
on the long slope below. 

“It’s late.” He mouthed the 
words with stiff lips. “It’s late . .” 



r-pwo hundred thousand feet 
above the surface of the out- 
post world Longone, the fleet 
interceptor split the stratosphere, 
its receptors fine-tuned to the 
Djann energy-call emission spec- 
trum. 

“Three hundred million square 
miles of desert,” Admiral Carna- 
by said. “Except for a couple of 
deserted townsites, not a sign 
that life ever existed here.” 

“We’ll find it, Tom,” Drew 
said. “If they’d lifted, Malthusa 
would have known — hold it!” 
He looked up quickly. “I’m get- 
ting something — yes! It’s the 
typical Djann idler output!” 
“How far from us?” 

“Quite a distance . Now it’s 
fading . ” 

The admiral put the ship into a 
screaming deceleration curve that 
crushed both men brutally 
against the restraint of their 
shock-frames. 

“Find that signal, George,” the 
vice-admiral grated. “Find it and 
steer me to it, if you have to 
pick it out of the air with psi!” 
“I’ve got it!” Drew barked. 
“Steer right, on 030. I’d range it 
at about two thousand kilome- 
ters . ” 

/^vn the bald face of an outcrop- 
ping of wind-scored stone, 
Carnaby clung one-handed to a 



THUNDERHEAD 



49 



scanty hold, supporting Terry 
with the other arm. The wind 
shrieked, buffeting at him; sand- 
fine snow whirled into his face, 
slashing at his eyes, already half- 
blinded by the glare. The boy 
slumped against him, barely con- 
scious. 

His mind seemed as sluggish 
now as his half-frozen limbs. 
Somewhere below, there was a 
ledge, with shelter from the wind. 
How far? Ten feet? Fifty? 

It didn’t matter. He had to 
reach it. He couldn’t hold on 
here, in this wind; in another 
minute he’d be done for. 

Carnaby pulled Terry closer, 
got a better grip with a hand that 
seemed no more a part of him 
than the rock against which they 
■ clung. He shifted his purchase 
with his right foot — and felt it 
slip. He was falling, grabbing 
frantically with one hand at the 
rock, then dropping through open 
air — 

The impact against drifted 
snow drove the air from his lungs. 
Darkness shot through with red 
fire threatened to close in on him ; 
he fought to draw a breath, strug- 
gling in the claustrophobia of 
suffocation. With a desperate 
lunge, he caught a ridge of hard 
ice, pulled himself back from the 
brink, then groped, found Terry, 
lying on his back under the ver- 
tically rising wall of rock. The 
boy stirred. 



“So . tired . .” he whis- 
pered. His body arced as he 
struggled to draw breath. 

Carnaby pulled himself to a 
position beside the boy, propped 
himself with his back against the 
rock. Dimly, through ice-rimmed 
eyes, he could see the evening 
lights of the settlement, far be- 
low; so far . 

He put his arm around the thin 
body, settled the lad’s head gent- 
ly in his lap, leaned over him to 
shelter him from the whirling 
snow. “It’s all right, Terry,” he 
said. “You can rest now.” 

Qupported on three narrow pen- 
^ cils of beamed force, the fleet 
interceptor slowly circuited the 
Djann yacht, hovering on its 
idling null-G generators a thou- 
sand feet above the towering 
white mountain. 

“Nothing alive there,” the co- 
pilot said. “Not a whisper on the 
life-detection scale.” 

“Take her down.” Vice-Admir- 
al Carnaby squinted through S-R 
lenses which had darkened almost 
to opacity in response to the 
frost-white glare from below. 
“The shack looks all right, but 
that doesn’t look like a Mark 7 
flitter parked beside it.” 

The heavy fleet boat descended 
swiftly under the expert guidance 
of the battle officer. At fifty feet, 
he leveled off, orbited the station. 
“I count four dead Djann,” the 



50 



GALAXY 



admiral said in a brittle voice. 

“Tracks,” the general pointed. 
“Leading off there . .” 

“Put her down, George!” The 
hundred-foot boat settled in with 
a crunching of rock and ice, its 
shark’s prow overhanging the edge 
of the tiny plateau. The hatch 
cycle open; the two men emerged. 

At the spot where Carnaby had 
lain in wait for the last of the 
aliens, they paused, staring si- 
lently at the glossy patch of dark 
blood, and at the dead Djann be- 
side it. Then they followed the 
irregularly spaced footprints 
across to the edge. 

“He was still on his feet — but 
that’s about all,” the battle of- 
ficer said. 

“George, can you operate that 
Spider boat?” The admiral indi- 
cated the Djann landing sled. 

“Certainly.” 

“Let’s go.” 

I t was twilight half an hour 
later when the admiral, peer- 
ing through the obscuring haze, 
saw the snow-drifted shapes hud- 
dled in the shadow of an over- 
hang. Fifty feet lower, the general 
settled the sled into a precarious 
landing on a narrow shelf. It was 
a ten minute climb back to their 
objective. 

Vice Admiral Carnaby pulled 
himself up the last yard, looked 
across the icy ledge at the figure 
in the faded blue polyon cold 



suit. He saw the weathered and 
lined face, glazed with ice; the 
closed eyes, the gnarled and 
bloody hands, the great wound in 
the side. 

The general came up beside 
him, stared silently, then went for- 
ward. 

“I’m sorry, Admiral,” he said 
a moment later. “He’s dead. Fro- 
zen. Both of them.” 

The admiral came up, went to 
Carnaby’s side. 

“I’m sorry, Jimmy,” he said. 
“Sorry.” 

“I don’t understand,” the gen- 
eral said. “He could have stayed 
up above, in the station. He’d 
have been all right there. What 
in the world was he doing down 
here?” 

“What he always did,” Admiral 
Carnaby said. “His duty.”

FAIR TEST 

by ROBIN SCOTT 



How odd these Earthmen were ! 
Their most bitter differences 
were only a matter of taste ! 



r T~'he breakdown at high veloc- 
ity had cost them nearly six 
weeks of arduous toil in their 
cumbersome space gear to repair 
and had shot them outward — 
dangerously low on fuel and 
food — far from civilization, out 
toward the very rim of the galaxy. 

G’ard and his mate E’lim had 
little choice; even should their 
fuel hold out — which was high- 
ly doubtful — they would be re- 
duced to eating the mah/-hide 
covers of the navigation tables 
long before they reached a Mer- 
vais outpost. 

They had to find fuel and food. 

G’ard consulted the tables and 
set course for the nearest likely 
star, a faint, negative-magnitude 
yellow whose size and age show- 
ed some promise of planetary de- 
velopment. 

As the old yellow brightened 
in the forward screens, the table- 



scope gave encouraging news. 
There were nine planets. After 
deceleration, however, the odds 
narrowed considerably. There ap- 
peared to be only one planet 
whose temperature range and 
spectrographic profile indicated 
some likelihood of affording both 
fuel and protoplasmic life suit- 
able for food. This planet, the 
third from its sun, was inspected 
at close range, and after twenty 
orbits G’ard conned the ship to a 
smooth landing on one of the ma- 
jor land-masses in the northern 
hemisphere. 



T Tnfortunately, the blast of 
landing destroyed several 
square poods of some sort of 
grain crop, and when G’ard 
stepped down from the ship to 
begin his hunt for fuel, he was 
met by an irate farmer who — no 
doubt angry at the destruction 



52 



of his fields and shocked by 
G’ard’s resemblance to one of the 
fiercer forms of carniverous life 
on the planet — delivered the 
contents of both barrels of an 
over-and-under .410 Shotgun at 
him. The pellets, of course, did 
not penetrate the Mervais’ thick 
hide, and with the translator held 
to his lips, he tried his best to 
placate the farmer. The translator 
had been stocked with planetary 
phrases gleaned from monitoring 
twelve or fourteen channels of 
communications during the twen- 
ty orbits of inspection. 

“Double your pleasure, double 
your fun!” said G’ard, his three 
left arms raised in formal salute. 

“Jesus Christ!” said the farm- 
er and ran pell-mell back to his 
miserable shack huddled at the 
edge of the burned field. 

G’ard fiddled with the controls 
of the translator and shouted 
after the fleeing farmer: “We 
need only food and fuel! Your 
cooperation will be greatly appre- 
ciated! This is a public service 
announcement!” But the farmer 
paid no attention. 

Poor as it was, the shack was 
equipped with a telephone line, 
and by the time E’lim had read 
off the fuel detector and dropped 
the ship’s fuel inductor hose down 
the farmer’s well, there was the 
scream of sirens, and a portly in- 
dividual equipped with a rubber 
truncheon and a pistol, accom- 

FA1R TEST 



panied by a dozen similarly 
equipped deputies, arrived in Hie 
farmyard. E’lim retreated into 
the ship and started the inductor 
pumps to fill the ship’s tanks. 

G’ard boosted the translator 
volume to full and spoke again: 
“We come in peace in our time. 
We want nothing but a full gro- 
cery cart and a tiger in our tank! 
Live light! Live modern! With 
G’ard and E’lim! Progress is our 
middle name!” 

A crowd began to gather. It 
grew larger and segregated itself 
automatically into two slightly 
intermingling groups. E’lim ap- 
peared with the fat reel of corral 
tape and began to lay it — white 
and bright — in two adjoining 
fan-shaped wedges extending out 
from the ship for the best part of 
a pood. 

>T''he crowd scattered at first, 
and there were ineffectual 
shots from the portly one and his 
assistants. But after E’lim had 
finished and returned to the ship, 
the crowd surged back again to 
gape open-mouthed at its vast 
bulk. The portly one with the 
truncheon, frustrated at his impo- 
tence, spoke angrily over the com- 
municator in his vehicle and then 
called his assistants to him. They 
could do nothing about the ship 
until reinforcements arrived; 
there remained only the crowd. 
They found the white tapes coii- 

53 



venient to mark the division be- 
tween the two groups, and they 
used their truncheons to keep the 
groups segregated. A small person 
with a white truck began to sell 
some sort of confection; he sold 
first to one group and then to the 
other. He was the only one be- 
side the men with truncheons who 
seemed to be able to pass freely 
from one group to the other. 

E’lim signaled to G’ard that 
the tanks were full. G’ard count- 
ed the crowd. Off in the distance 
there was the rumble of armored 
vehicles, and overhead the omi- 
nous drone of aircraft. 

G’ard turned the translator to 
full volume again. “Thank you,” 
he said. “Thank you for tuning 
in! You have been a wonderful 
audience!” 

He withdrew into the ship and 
reeled in the inductor hose and 
the corral tapes. When all was in 
place, he closed the cargo hatch 
and started the engines for take- 
off. 

That evening, after the com- 
plex course back to the heart of 
the galaxy had been calculated 
and fed into the autopilot, G’ard 
and E’lim relaxed over their 
evening meal. G’ard said: “I’m 
sorry we couldn’t stay longer to 
study that curious planet. I’ve 
gone over the translator input 
material a bit, and I think I can 
explain why that thick one with 
the weapon separated all those 

54 



other ones into two groups.” 
“Oh really?” said E’lim. “I 
wondered about that.” 

“Yes,” said G’ard. “Seems 
there is some subtle difference 
among these creatures, although 
Gloog knows they looked enough 
alike.” 

“What is it?” inquired E’lim. 
“Some have darker skins than 
others,” said G’ard. “Here, look. 
This is a photograph I made 
while we were loading fuel. No- 
tice, the thick one has made all 
those with dark skins stand here, 
and all those with light skins 
stand there.” 

E’lim shook her head in won- 
derment, her polished tusks 
gleaming in the dying light of the 
cooking fire. “Imagine that. Such 
a tiny difference!” 

“Apparently they believe there 
is a real substantive difference 
between the light-skinned ones 
and the dark-skinned ones.” 
E’lim shook her head again. 
“How strange. I’m sure they must 
be the same species.” 

“Of course,” said G’ard. “But 
maybe they know something 
about themselves we weren’t able 
to observe.” 

E’lim shrugged and began to 
clear the table of the remains of 
their dinner. “Could be,” she said. 
“I’ll fix one of the light-skinned 
ones for dinner tomorrow night, 
and we can compare for our- 
selves.” — ROBIN SCOTT

OF THE COMETS 

nphe time has come for one 
: more column devoted exclu- 

sively to questions from the read- 
ers. The first of them concerns 
comets, and the letter I have 
reads: “I can’t quite figure out 
whether I am supposed to con- 
sider them as members of the 
solar system or as interlopers 
from space. If I knew whether 



55 



most of them orbit in the plane 
of the ecliptic it would help me 
make up my mind, but I haven’t 
been able to find that much out. 
Do you know the answer to that 
one?” 

Well, I think I do, but let ev- 
erybody judge for himself after 
I have presented the material. 

The early astronomers who 
considered comets celestial phe- 
nomena — the Aristotelian philo- 
sophers insisted that they were 
atmospheric phenomena — did 
not say much about the shape of 
their orbits. Johannes Kepler 
went on record as thinking that 
the orbits of comets were prob- 
ably straight lines and not closed 
curves like the orbits of the plan- 
ets. Until the time of Dr. Edmond 
Halley every comet was taken to 
be a one-time visitor to the sun 
and to the solar system, and Hal- 
ley himself held that belief at 
first. In around 1700 Halley be- 
gan assembling a table of comets 
that had been well reported as to 
time and position in the sky and 
came to the conclusion that the 
comets of 1531, 1607 and 1682 
might have been the same comet. 
If so, it would return in 1758. 

Halley did not live to see the 
return of the comet which then 
was named after him, but this 
return proved that there was at 
least one comet that moved in a 
closed orbit. Of course astronom- 
ers started to watch for other 



comets with even greater interest 
than before, and the main ques- 
tion asked of each newly discov- 
ered comet was whether it was a 
“periodic comet” (with a closed 
orbit) or a non-periodic comet, 
a one-time visitor to the sun. By 
about the year 1900 the position 
of most astronomers was that 
comets were visitors from deep 
space. But a certain percentage 
of these comets had the bad luck 
to pass close to a planet on such 
a visit, and the gravitational dis- 
turbance in the comet orbit caus- 
ed by the planet could easily 
force that comet to assume a new 
orbit, a closed orbit. The planets 
were, therefore, responsible for 
the existence of periodic comets, 
and the larger the planet the 
more periodic comets could be 
credited to it. The periodic com- 
ets clearly indicated Which plan- 
et had made them periodic; the 
aphelion of the new orbit was, as 
a rule, a little farther from the 
sun than the orbit of the planet 
that had caused the “capture.” It 
became customary to refer to the 
comets captured by the same 
planet as the “comet family” of 
that planet, and nobody was sur- 
prised to learn that Jupiter had 
the most in its comet family. 

Of course the periodic comets 
had elliptical orbits, while the or- 
bits of the non-periodic comets 
were said to be parabolic orbits 
— though it was much more prob- 



56 



GALAXY 



able that these orbits really were 
hyperbolas. 

Naturally, the .larger the num- 
ber of apparent positions in the 
sky that have been observed and 
recorded, the more reliable the 
calculation of the comet’s orbit. 
Early in this century professor 
A. O. Leuschner of the University 
of California noticed that comets 
that had been observed for only 
a short time were always said to 
have had parabolic orbits. Leus- 
chner then made himself a table 
of comet orbits and paid special 
attention to the length of time a 
particular comet had been under 
observation. 

The result, published by the 
Astronomical Society of the Paci- 
fic in April, 1907, caused a great 
deal of second thoughts. Con- 
densed, Leuschner ’s findings were 
the following: 



Number of days a 
comet was under 
observation: 

100 - 239 days 
1-99 days 
240 - 511 days 



Nnmber of orbits 
found to be 
parabolic: 

55 per cent 
13 per cent 
68 per cent 



This seemed to indicate that at 
least a large number of those or- 
bits that had been thought to be 
parabolic might have turned out 
to be very elongated ellipses if 
that comet could have been ob- 
served for a longer time. Profes- 
sor Leuschner concluded: “The 
theory that, in general, comets 



are permanent members of our 
solar system seems to have been 
greatly strengthened by the fore- 
going preliminary statistics.” 

The first result was the recal- 
culation of a few orbits, Comet 
1886 II had been thought to have 
had an open orbit. The German 
mathematician Thraen showed 
that a more careful calculation 
produced an elliptical orbit. Pro- 
fessor Elis Stromgren in Copen- 
hagen went over the orbits of 
comets 1890 II and 1898 VII and 
concluded that one had reasons 
to doubt that these two comets 
had displayed hyperbolic orbits. 
All this led, gradually, to the con- 
cept of a “comet cloud,” say half 
a light-year beyond the orbit of 
Neptune. Since this comet cloud 
was still under the gravitational 
influence of the sun and there- 
fore had to move through space 
along with the sun, the comets, 
in general, were declared to be a 
part of the solar system. 

Unfortunately the position of a 
comet orbit relative to the eclip- 
tic is not a touchstone as to its 
membership in the solar system 
or not. When a comet (presum- 
ably coming from that comet 
cloud and approaching the sun 
for the first time) is captured by 
a planet its orbit is twisted vio- 
lently, and the twist might well 
involve the third dimension, so 
that the final orbit forms a steep 
angle with the ecliptic. Comets

57 



that travel at an angle of very 
nearly 90 degrees but are very 
definitely periodic have been put 
on record. It is true, though, that 
the short-period comets do not 
deviate from the plane of the 
ecliptic very much. 

Even if that comet cloud half 
a light-year away should not ex- 
ist, the vast majority of all comets 
must be considered permanent 
members of the solar system, even 
those with an orbital period of 
2000 years. (Several such are 
known.) But a planet can also 
accelerate the speed of a comet 
along its orbit, which means that 
an elongated ellipse could be 
changed into a hyperbola. If that 
is the case the comet would leave 
our solar system and could', after 
a very long time, approach an- 
other solar system. 

Since this has been seen to 
happen in our own solar system, 
we must assume that it can hap- 
pen in another solar system too. 
Therefore a new comet could be 
a stray from deep space, but it 
would literally be one in a mil- 
lion. 

Tlse vanished elements 

' | ''his section was prompted by 
a letter from an executive in 
Chicago who asked “whatever be- 
came of virginium?” He explained 
that he had learned about the 
then recent discovery of the ele- 



ment virginium while in college, 
but that his later work did not 
involve chemistry in any form or 
shape, not even remotely. Recent- 
ly his son brought a modem ver- 
sion of the Periodic Table into 
the house. My correspondent re- 
membered virginium, could not 
find it in the table, and both he 
and his son concluded that it 
must be there under a different 
name. “But,” he wrote, “I always 
thought that the discoverer of 
something gives it its name and 
that this name is permanent.” 
Yes, that is true; the rule is 
that the name is given by the dis- 
coverer or else by somebody else 
with the approval of the discov- 
erer. If the discoverer does not 
approve somebody else’s sugges- 
tion that suggestion is discarded. 
This happened in the case of 
Jupiter-V, the fifth moon of Ju- 
piter to be discovered and the one 
that is closest to the planet. It 
was discovered (at midnight on 
September 9, 1892) by the Ameri- 
can astronomer Edward Emerson 
Barnard. The French astronomer 
Camille Flammarion suggested 
that it be named Amalthea, in 
Greek mythology the nursemaid 
of Jupiter, but Barnard rejected 
the suggestion. By then every- 
body was talking about “the fifth 
moon of Jupiter,” and Barnard 
insisted on the designation Ju- 
piter-V. Only during the last 
twenty years the name Amalthea 



58 



GALAXY 



has been slowly creeping into 
usage. 

But for the name given by the 
discoverer, or approved by the 
discoverer, to become “official” 
two conditions must be fulfilled. 
The first is that it has not been 
used earlier for something else. 
An English zoologist learned that 
lesson when he named a mammal 
from Australia that was just be- 
coming known “platypus.” It 
turned out that about ten years 
earlier a German zoologist had 
given that name to a genus of 
small beetles. Since the beetles 
had that name first they retained 
it, and the Australian platypus 
had to be renamed; its zoological 
name is Ornithorhynchus. 

The second condition is that 
the discoverer had to be right, in 
other words that he actually 
made a discovery. And that is 
where “virginium” fell down. The 
announcement had been a mis- 
take. It had been made in 1929 
by Dr. Fred Allison of the Ala- 
bama Polytechnic Institute, and 
he had named “his” element after 
the state in which he was born. 
It is not quite known what he had 
done wrong; apparently he used 
a misleading method of analysis. 

Of course mistakes in the chem- 
istry of the lesser known elements 
had been made before. Around 
the year 1825 the Swedish chem- 
ist Carl Gustaf Mosander, a 
friend of Jons Jakob Berzelius, 



had announced an “earth” which 
he called “didymia,” from the 
Greek word for “twin” because it 
seemed to him to be a twin of 
lanthanum. The term “earth” was 
then used for substances that 
could not be dissolved in water 
or in alcohol but could be dis- 
solved in acids. The chemists of 
that time already knew that an 
“earth” was usually the oxide or 
the carbonate (and sometimes a 
sulphide) of a metal. If Mosander 
had succeeded in isolating the 
metal in his “didymia,” the metal 
would have received the name of 
didymium. Mosander never did 
succeed; and sixty years later, in 
1885, the Austrian chemist Carl 
Auer, Baron von Welsbach, 
showed why. “Didymia” was a 
mixture of praseodymia and neo- 
dymia, two of the so-called rare 
earth elements. A little later Auer 
von Welsbach — some of my 
readers may be old enough to re- 
member the “Welsbach mantle” 
— discovered two more of these 
elements and named them cassio- 
peium and aldebaranium. But 
this time he had come too late. 
The French chemist Georges IJr- 
bain had discovered them earlier 
and had named them lutetium 
(the cassiopeium of Welsbach) 
and neoytterbium, later short- 
ened to ytterbium. 

Then George Urbain made a 
mistake, and the English chemist 
Henry Gwyn- Jeffries Moseley 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



59 



proved it to him. Urbain was de- 
lighted, not because he had made 
a mistake but because Moseley’s 
proof involved a new method for 
arranging the table of the ele- 
ments. Mendeleyeff had arranged 
them by atomic weight. Moseley 
did it by “atomic number,” name- 
ly the number of electrons around 
an atom which, in turn, shows the 
number of atomic charges in the 
nucleus. This did not change the 
Periodic Table very much, but 
it made it more precise. Because 
of Moseley’s numbers one could 
state, positively that in 1916 only 
elements #43, #61, #72, #85, #87 
and #91 were still missing, plus 
possible elements heavier than 
uranium (#92). 

Mistakes like Allison’s with his 
“virginium” were caused by the 
systematic hunt for these missing 
elements. To begin with the light- 
est, the German team of Dr. Ida 
Tacke and Dr. Walter Noddack 
announced in 1925 that they had 
discovered #43 which they named 
“masurium” and #75 which they 
named rhenium. “Masurium” was 
put in quotation marks because it 
was a mistake; rhenium was a 
discovery. Nowadays #43 is 
named technetium. It does not 
have any stable isotopes, though 
one of these isotopes has an im- 
pressively long half-life, namely 
210,000 years. 

The missing #61 was announc- 
ed in 1927 by Professor B. Smith 



Hopkins of the University of Il- 
linois and named “illinium.” At 
about the same time Professor 
Luigi Rolla of the University of 
Florence thought that he had dis- 
covered it and named it “floren- 
tium.” It was not actually dis- 
covered until 1945 and is now 
called promethium. Like #43 it 
has no stable isotopes and the one 
with the longest half-life has one 
of only 2.6 years. 

In 1911 George Urbain thought 
that he had discovered #72 and 
had named it “celtium” (this was 
the mistake where Moseley show- 
ed him that he had been wrong; 
it was a mixture of several ele- 
ments). The actual discovery took 
place in Copenhagen in 1923 
(hence the name hafnium from 
the Latin name of Copenhagen), 
but the discoverers were not 
Danes. They were the Hungarian 
George von Hevesy and the 
Dutchman Dirk Coster. 

Element #85 was announced in 
1931 by Fred Allison and Edgar 
J. Murphy and, since they were 
working in Alabama, they called 
it “alabamine.” It is now called 
astatine (for “unstable”) because 
it has no stable isotopes. The one 
with the longest half-life can 
boast only 8.3 hours. The actual 
discovery took place in 1940. 

And now we come to #87, the 
“virginium” that has caused the 
whole discussion. It had still an- 
other name; the Roumanian 



60 



GALAXY 



chemist Horia Hulubei wanted to 
name it “moldavium” after the 
river Moldau in Bohemia. He was 
mistaken too, and it was Made- 
moiselle Marguerite Perey in 
Paris, who could show that #87 
was present in a substance she 
was investigating. That was in 
1939, and the name became fran- 
cium. It is even less stable than 
any of the others. The longest- 
lived isotope of francium known 
has a half-life of only 22 minutes. 

This leaves element #91, and 
here we have a case where the 
discoverer did not have his way 
in naming it. It was discovered 
in 1917 by Otto Hahn and Lise 
Meitner, and they called it pro- 
toactinium; the name was soon 
shortened to protactinium. But 
then Otto Hahn found that it 
was identical with an element 
discovered in 1913 by Kasimir 
Fajans and O. H. Goehring. They 
had found a substance with a 
half-life of a little less than 1.2 
minutes. Since it was so short- 
lived they had named it “bre- 
vium,” from Latin breve which 
means “short”; a lawyer’s “brief” 
is derived from the same word — 
except that it usually isn’t. Hahn 
said the name brevium should go 
to the element found by him and 
Lise Meitner since Fajans and 
Goehring had found it first and 
named it. But he had to admit 
that the half-life of his discovery 
was “over 1200 years” and the 



various international scientific or- 
ganizations simply said “no” to 
Hahn. They would not accept the 
name “brevium” for such an ele- 
ment. 

As a matter of fact they were 
even more in the right than they 
thought, for the half-life of pro- 
tactinium is 34,000 years. 

The two Otto Hahns 

Hphe name of Otto Hahn was in 
the public eye in September 
1966, partly because of the an- 
nouncement that the first atomic- 
propelled ship built by West Ger- 
many had been named Otto 
Hahn and partly because the En- 
rico Fermi Award of the Atomic 
Energy Commission for 1966 was 
awarded to Otto Hahn, Lise 
Meitner and Fritz Strassmann. It 
was the first time that this award 
was given to foreign scientists, 
and the New York Times re- 
ported this fact. 

Three days later I received a 
letter containing the clipping 
from the Times. The writer of the 
letter wanted to know whether 
the Otto Hahn who 'had just re- 
ceived the Enrico Fermi Award 
and the Otto Hahn discussed on 
pp. 491-2 of my book Watchers 
of the Skies were related, maybe 
father and son. The Otto Hahn 
mentioned in my book had pub- 
lished, in 1880, a book on fossil 
organisms in chondritic meteor-

ites, a theme that was revived a 
few years ago. 

Though I own a copy of the 
book by this earlier Otto Hahn, I 
have not been able to find out 
much about him. But the Otto 
Hahn who discovered protactin- 
ium and later uranium fission was 
bom in Frankfurt am Main on 
March 8, 1879, and his father’s 
Christian name had been Hein- 
rich, and he had not been a scien- 
tist, not even an amateur scien- 
tist. He came from a family of 
grape growers and settled in 
Frankfurt as a glazier. 

Since the name Hahn is not 
rare in Germany, and Otto is one 
of the most common given names 
in Germany — my own father 
was named Otto — I think it is 
safe to say that the two Otto 
Hahns are not related at all. 



The number of artificial satellites 

Qometimes the reply to a short 
k -' question 'has to be fairly long, 
and here is a case in point. The 
question was on a postcard from 
a reader in Portland, Oregon, and 
it simply said: “Could you tell 
me how many artificial satellites 
are in orbit right now?” The post- 
mark said that this postcard had 
been mailed on September 13, 
1966, when Gemini XI was in 
orbit, a fact which may have 
triggered the question. 

Well, with the aid of the Satel- 
lite Situation Reports of the God- 
dard Space Flight Center in 
Greenbelt, Maryland, I can at- 
tempt an answer, but my answer 
may be off by two or three satel- 
lites and a dozen or two of other 
orbiting “space junk.” 



62 



GALAXY 



The center of the galaxy 



The table includes Gemini 
XI which has meanwhile re- 
turned to earth. One of the Rus- 
sian Cosmos satellites re-entered 
at the same time so that on Sept- 
ember 15 the number of orbiting 
satellites was 175. 

On the same date two satellites 
(Russia’s Luna 10 and America’s 
Lunar Orbiter I) were in orbit 
around the moon and will stay in 
orbit around the moon, while a 
total of 27 planetary probes (in- 
cluding some upper stages of the 
rockets that put them into these 
orbits) were in orbit around the 
sun. 

Now what about these figures 
in parantheses, the (-(-210) for 
1961 and the three figures for 
1965? These are small pieces re- 
sulting from unexplained explo- 
sions. Presumably so-called “de- 
struct charges” went into action 
when they shouldn’t have, or the 
remaining fuel in an orbiting top 
stage exploded. The (-(-120) and 
(-(-14) in 1965 are of Russian ori- 
gin; the others originated with 
American shots. 

Such small pieces rarely stay 
in orbit for very long, so that the 
figures given in my tabulation 
do not hold true any more when 
this issue of the magazine reaches 
its readers. 



A nother reader, also living in 
Chicago, came up with an 
interesting question. He wrote 
that he knew that our solar sys- 
tem is about two thirds of the 
distance from the center of our 
galaxy to its rim so that, if we 
accept the figure of 50,000 light- 
years for the radius of the galaxy 
we are roughly 33,000 light-years 
from the center. He added that 
he also knew that we cannot see 
the center of our galaxy because 
of intervening clouds of cosmic 
dust. But, he said, if the center 
were visible to us, in which direc- 
tion would I have to look? His 
astronomy book did not tell him 
that. 

No, most astronomy books 
don’t, as I found out when I 
started to dig a little in order to 
answer the question. But here is 
the prescription: arm yourself 

with a star chart, wait for a clear 
night, get out of the city and then 
try to find the constellation of 
Sagittarius. Look at the approxi- 
mate center of that constellation 
and you are looking in the direc- 
tion of the center of our galaxy. 
Too bad we can’t actually see it, 
it would be a glorious sight to be- 
hold. — WILLY LEV

THE NEW MEMBER 



by CHRISTOPHER ANVIL 



Bongolia was not the biggest of 
the United Nations — but for at 
least a time if was the loudest! 



TJadibax, Bangolia, March 15th. 
*■ ’ Dr. Hodiroy Dabigam, new- 
ly elected president of the Re- 
public of the United Bongolias, 
today presided in ceremonies 
during which the flag of the 
Bongolian Republic was raised 
over the Sanctuary, the princi- 
pal building of the capital city 
of Badibax. The Sanctuary, built 
in the fourteenth century by 
European traders, was today re- 
christened Palace of the Presi- 
dents by Dr. Hodiroy, who was 
cheered by an enthusiastic 
crowd estimated by newsmen at 
around four thousand. Dr. Ho- 
diroy announced that Bangolia 
will seek admission to the Unit- 
ed Nations, in order to “take 
our rightful place in the coun- 
cils of the mighty.” Vice admiral 
K. C. Baines, commander of the 
U. S. 34th Fleet, was among 



the American representatives at 
the ceremony, which was also 
attended by delegations from a 
number of other nations, includ- 
ing communist China. 

New York, April 1st. The Re- 
public of the United Bangolias 
today v/as officially admitted 
to the United Nations. 

New York, April 2nd. Sodi- 
box Gozinaz Hodiroy, head of 
the Bongolian delegation to the 
United Nations, today demand- 
ed that Bongolia be admitted to 
a seat on the Security Council. 
Mr. Sodibox charged that it is 
unfair to have only a compara- 
tively few nations represented 
on the Security Council. “Who 
are they?” he demanded. “Is 
this right? They are few. We are 
many. Why should they have 



64 



it and not we?” Mr. Sodibox, 
who spoke in native costume, 
also charged that many crimes 
had been committed against his 
country by the European trad- 
ers who established themselves 
in the fourteenth century at the 
Bongolian capital, Badibax. Mr. 
Sodibox stated that it was not 
known just what nation these 
traders belonged to, but he 
charged that their presence had 
held back the development of 
Bongolian culture, reduced his 
nation to peonage and wreaked 
tremendous physical and psy- 
chological damage upon his peo- 
ple, damage which still manifest- 
ed itself today. Mr. Sodibox de- 
manded that reparations be paid 
by all the European nations, 
plus the U. S., Canada, Mexico, 
Australia, New Zealand and the 
“other colonialist powers respon- 
sible for the outrage.” 

Washington, April 4th. When 
asked today what the U. S. 
proposed to do about the Bongo- 
lian demand for reparations, the 
Secretary of State replied that 
he was a little puzzled by Mr. 
Sodibox’s charge, insofar as the 
United States did not exist in 
the fourteenth century, when the 
alleged crimes took place. The 
fourteenth century, he pointed 
out, includes dates from the 
beginning of the year 1300 
through to the end of the year 



1399, and the American contin- 
ent was not even discovered by 
Columbus till 1492, one hundred 
years later. The United States, 
he said, sympathized with the 
Bongolian Republic, but natural- 
ly could not be expected to pay 
for crimes it had never commit- 
ted. 

New York, April 4th. Sodi- 
box Gozinaz Hodiroy, chief of 
the Bongolian delegation to the 
United Nations, today charged 
the American Secretary of State 
with bad faith. In an impas- 
sioned speech, Mr. Sodibox de- 
clared, “Look at my people! 
Have they not suffered? It is 
the American imperialists who 
have committed this crime! 
They are responsible! And when 
they are called to account be- 
fore the councils of the mighty 
they try to squirm out by some 
jugglery with numbers! Are 
numbers more important than 
the sufferings of my people?” 

Washington, April 6th. In his 
news conference this morning, 
the President was asked his 
views on the Bongolian crisis. 
After a considerable pause, he 
replied that while the United 
States felt great sympathy for 
all who suffered from poverty 
and want, nevertheless the Unit- 
ed States could not accept the 
blame for a crime committed by

persons unknown, some four 
hundred years before the United 
States was founded. 

Badibax, Bongolia, April 10th. 
Speaking before a roaring crowd 
officially estimated at some sev- 
enteen thousand. President Dr. 
Hodiroy Dabigam accused the 
United States of “treason to the 
principle of self-determination of 
the nations, treason to the prin- 
cipal of responsibility for past 
crimes, treason against race, 
religion, color, national origin, 
and the payments of past debts.” 

He likened the U. S. President 
to a dog licking up the vomit 
of another dog, whom he iden- 
tified as the U. S. Secretary of 
State. President Dr. Hodiroy 
warned that “the soverign peo- 
ples of the world will not long 
ignore such insults as these.” 
The Americans, he stated, are 
running dogs for the nations of 
Europe, which seek to ecsape 
their responsibility for the 
crimes against Bongolia, and the 
Americans moreover are des- 
cendants of these Europeans, 
and therefore in it with them. 
America, President Dr. Hodiroy 
warned, had best beware, lest 
the dispossessed nations of South 
America, Africa, Asia and all 
the world rise in one body, led 
by the Republic of the United 
Bongolias, and “claim the ven- 
geance which has been unpaid 



now for six hundred years.” At 
the climax of President Hodi- 
roy’s speech, the U. S. flag was 
burned, the Secretary of State 
was hanged in effigy, and an 
effigy of the American president 
was thrown into the streets to 
be spat upon, defiled and picked 
to pieces by the frenzied mob. 
In addition, three U. S. sailors 
were reported missing. 

New York, April 11th. Sodibox 
Gozinaz Hodiroy, speaking to 
reporters, today charged that 
the riots in Bongolia “were fo- 
mented by the inflammatory 
speeches of the American Pres- 
ident and Secretary of State, who 
are therefore personally respon- 
sible for them. They have caus- 
ed them by their refusal to pay 
for their crimes.” Mr. Sodibox 
was asked by one reporter for 
the date of his birth. Mr. Sodi- 
box replied that he was forty- 
one years old. The reporter then 
asked Mr. Sodibox what he 
would do if he were charged 
with a rape that had occurred 
fifty years ago. Mr. Sodibox re- 
fused to answer the question. 

Washington, April 14th. Sen- 
ator Clyde Deebling today call- 
ed for “immediate full-scale eco- 
nomic aid to the Bongolian Re- 
public,” which he said “would 
otherwise be in danger of fall- 
ing into the hands of the com- 



66 



GALAXY 



munists.” In an unprecedented 
scene, Senator Deebling was 
booed for fifteen minutes and 
finally forced to sit down. The 
view here is that the govern- 
ment of Bongolia is lucky not 
to have done all this a hundred 
years ago. But since war be- 
tween the present-day U. S. and 
Bongolia, which in actuality is a 
moderately large island in the 
Sadinak Straits, would be ridi- 
culous, we are in a predicament 
to know just what to do about 
it. A great many congressmen, 
meanwhile, report receiving an- 
gry telegrams from their consti- 
tuents demanding to know what 
has happened to the American 
sailors. 

New York, April 14th. A num- 
ber of delegates from Afro-Asian 
countries are reportedly urging 
Sodibox Gozinaz, head of the 
delegation from Bongolia, to 
take it slower in his attacks on 
the U. S. These delegates, it is 
reported, feel that Mr. Sodibox 
is rousing antagonisms that will 
not help their efforts to obtain 
more economic aid from the U. S. 

New York, April 14th. Sodi- 
box Gozinaz Hodiroy, the Bon- 
golian delegate to the U.N., to- 
day charged Great Britain, 
France, Spain, Italy, the Nether- 
lands, the Soviet Union and 
Greece, with complicity in the 



attempt to avoid payment for 
the depredations of European 
traders who invaded Bongolia in 
the fourteenth century. Since it 
is not known exactly what na- 
tionality these traders were, Mr. 
Sodibox affirmed his govern- 
ment’s position that “all alike 
must share in the responsibili- 
ty.” Mr. Sodibox estimates the 
damage done to Bongolia by 
the traders at two billion kitta- 
gotigs. The kittagotig is the new 
official unit of Bongolian cur- 
rency. Its value is fixed by the 
Bongolian government at twice 
the value of the U. S. dollar. 

Badibax. Bongolia, April 15th. 
No satisfactory answer having 
been received from the govern- 
ments of Great Britain, France, 
Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, 
the Soviet Union and Greece, 
President Dr. Hodiroy Dabigam, 
speaking to a frenzied rally esti- 
mated officially at 40,000 per- 
sons, stated that these nations, 
along with the United States 
and other guilty parties, owed 
the Bongolian Republic two bil- 
lion kittagotigs, plus interest 
compounded annually at twelve 
per cent since the year 1300, 
for their “infamous crimes 
against the Bongolian peoples, 
crimes including rape, incest, 
murder, pillage, brutality, us- 
ury, extortion and seizure of 
lands public and private.” At

the climax of his speech, Presi- 
dent Dr. Hodiroy personally 
hurled down to the mob effigies 
of the chiefs of state of Great 
Britain, France, Spain, Italy, the 
Netherlands, the Soviet Union 
and Greece, which were spat on, 
defiled and kicked around the 
public square. Later, the na- 
tional flags of these nations 
were lashed with whips, pound- 
ed with clubs and then burned 
to the frenzied cheers of the 
mob. 

New York, April 16th. Sodi- 
box Gozinaz Hodiroy, chief of 
the delegation from the Republic 
of the United Bongolias, appear- 
ed in the U. N. General As- 
sembly this morning, wearing his 
national costume, with the addi- 
tion of four dried hands dan- 
gling from the front and rear of 
a strap worn across his left 
shoulder. These hands, Mr. So- 
dibox said, are “symbols of the 
suffering of my people at the 
hands of the foreign exploit- 
ers.” When asked where these 
dried hands came from, Mr. So- 
dibox replied that they were 
obtained from “enemies of the 
state.” 

Washington, April 16th. “Un- 
impeachable government sources” 
state today that repeated quer- 
ies to the Bongolian govern- 
ment about the fate of the 



three missing U. S. sailors have 
gone unanswered. 

Badibax, Bongolia, April 17th. 
Persistent rumors are reported 
here that two white Americans 
and a Negro American are being 
exhibited in wooden cages in 
a kind of carnival held on the 
outskirts of Badibax. Sharp- 
edged shells, it is reported, are 
thrown through the bars at the 
prisoners, and those who hit 
them win prizes. The description 
of these men matches that of 
the mission U. S. sailors. 

With the 34th Fleet in the 
Straits of Sadinak, April 18th. 
A predawn raid by U. S. Ma- 
rines this morning recovered the 
three U. S. sailors missing for 
more than a week. All three men 
are reported in serious condi- 
tion, suffering from hunger, 
thirst, loss of blood and many 
deep and badly infected cuts. 

New York, April 18th. In an 
impassioned speech before the 
U. N. General Assembly, Mr. 
Sodibox Gozinaz Hodiroy, his 
face smeared with blood and 
dirt, and wearing the Bongo- 
lian “suit of eighteen pleading 
heads,” made an impassioned 
attack upon the United States 
for its “arrogant interference in 
Bongolian domestic affairs.” He 
charged the U. S. with “aggres- 



68 



GALAXY 



sion, provocation, trespass and 
the theft of Bongolian Govern- 
ment prisoners.” Mr. Sodibox 
likened the U. S. to a rich 
landowner who steals chickens 
from his impoverished neighbor. 
As Mr. Sodibox reached the cli- 
max of his speech, one of the 
dried heads slipped loose from 
its rawhide thong, fell on the 
table and rolled off onto the 
floor. The General Assembly ad- 
journed early, without voting on 
Mr. Sodibox’s demand for a vote 
of censure against the U. S. 

Badibax, Bongolia, April 19th. 
In an impassioned speech to a 
frenzied mob officially estimat- 
ed at eighty thousand persons, 
President Dr. Hodiroy Dabigam 
accused the U. S. of “wanton 
naked aggression against the 
sovereign state of the Republic of 
the United Bongolias” and 
warned that “all oppressed peo- 
ples of the world will rise up 
behind the Bongolian martyrs 
and hurl themselves upon the 
American aggressors in a holy 
bonganap.” (The Bongolian 
word “bonganap” is not direct- 
ly translatable. It does not mean 
“war” or “crusade,” but refers 
more to the slaughter of the 
enemy, followed by the breaking 
of the bones of the enemy dead. 
This is considered to cause fur- 
ther pain to those who have al- 
ready been killed.) President Dr. 



Hodiroy further accused the 
American Marines of cowardice, 
charging that they came armed 
with modern weapons “only be- 
cause they are afraid to fight 
like men, with spears, knives, 
and stranglewhips.” (The “stran- 
glewhip” is a long, slender cord 
with heavy knout at the end. It 
is said that skillful wielders of 
this weapon can coil it around 
an enemy’s neck from behind, 
without coming close enough for 
him to hear their approach; 
then, by clever manipulation of 
the whip, the wielder can stran- 
gle the enemy to death with- 
out ever getting close enough for 
the enemy to strike back.) Pres- 
ident Dr. Hodiroy further an- 
nounced that he holds the U. S. 
president “personally and im- 
mediately responsible for this 
outrage and hereby demands a 
full and immediate explanation 
and apology for this unwarrant- 
ed intrusion upon sovereign Bon- 
golian territory. Otherwise the 
U. S. will be subject to re- 
taliation by the full weight of 
Bongolian military might.” It 
is reported that nearly four 
hundred Chinese communist 
technicians, military advisors 
and specialists in guerilla war- 
fare have arrived in Bongolia 
since the beginning of the year.

Vice Admiral K. C. Baines, 
commander of naval forces here, 
has reportedly been petitioned 
by his contingent of Marines, 
many of whom wish to go 
ashore at Badibax in answer to 
the Bongolian president’s ac- 
cusation of “cowardice.” The 
story is that the Marines would 
be happy to go after the Bongo- 
lian armed only with belts, bay- 
onets or barehanded and are 
confident they could “clean the 
place out in an hour.” One en- 
listed man described the capital 
city of Badibax as “about a 
medium-sized town, with the 
ocean in front, the jungle be- 
hind, the Kratigatik River to 
the west and the Chicago dump 
to the east.” 

New York, April 19th. Afro- 
Asian members of the U. N. 
are visibly shunning the Bongo- 
lian delegation. This appears to 
be in response to the widely 
quoted Bongolian claim that 
“Bongolian is the natural leader 
of the Afro-Asian bloc.” Mr. 
Sodibox Gozinaz, speaking to 
reporters, today reasserted this 
position, charging that the other 
Afro-Asian nations “are back- 
ward and have no culture.” 

Washington, April 19th. Usu- 
ally reliable sources here state 
that there is no truth to the 
humor currently circulating that 



the U. S. plans a punitive ex- 
pedition against the Bongolians. 
An official spokesman stated, 
“We’ve got our men back, and 
that’s what we were after.” Ask- 
ed about the personal feelings 
of high government officials to- 
ward the Bongolians, the spokes- 
man refused comment. 

Badibax, Bongolia, April 20th. 
Addressing a huge rally and 
speaking from the Palace of the 
Presidents, President Dr. Hodi- 
roy Dabigam announced tonight 
completion of a new treaty with 
communist China. This treaty, 
President Dr. Hodiroy told the 
cheering crowd provides for 
economic assistance and mutual 
aid and defense. Accordingly, 
said Dr. Hodiroy, he hereby 
calls upon communist China “to 
come at once to the aid of 
oppressed Bongolia.” Amid the 
wild cheers of a crowd official- 
ly estimated at one hundred 
thousand, President Dr. Hodiroy 
declared, “we now call upon our 
pledged allies to hurl themselves 
at once into universal mortal 
conflict at all points with the 
mutual enemy who has sullied 
the soil of the Republic of the 
United Bongolias. We will do 
the same, in turn, if our ally 
is ever attacked.”

about the “American aggres- 
sion” in rescuing three cap- 
tured U. S. sailors from the 
Bongolians. There is also no 
word about the treaty. 

Moscow, April 23rd. A high 
Soviet official contacted here to- 
day was asked about the appar- 
ent predominance of Chinese 
communist influence in Bon- 
golia. He replied smilingly that 
he understood that the Chinese 
were not perfectly happy with 
their new ally, but the Soviet 
Union “does not wish to inter- 
fere.” 

Badibax, Bongolia, April 24th. 
President Dr. Hodiroy Dabigam, 
addressing a wildly enthusiastic 
crowd officially estimated at a 
quarter of a million persons, 
called again tonight for the “im- 
mediate destruction by our 
Chinese allies of the American 
imperialists who committed rap- 
ine, murder, trespass and lar- 
ceny against our people by their 
brutal armed aggression.” Pres- 
ident Dr. Hodiroy injected a 
new note into the demand by 
observing, “We have over four 
hundred Chinese here — they 
are in our power, remember.” 

New York, April 25th. The 
head of the Bongolian delega- 
tion, Sodibox Gozinaz Hodiroy 
attempted to speak today, but 



the hall emptied so rapidly that 
he was left with no audience. 
Mr. Sodibox was wearing his 
“suit of eighteen pleading 
heads.” A number of delegates, 
interviewed outside, stated that 
in their opinion the admission 
of Bongolia to the world body 
had been “premature.” 

Washington, April 26th. A 
number of U. S. senators and 
congressmen are reportedly 
agreed that the whole body of 
assumptions underlying the U. 
S. attitude toward the U. N. 
and many foreign nations needs 
to be re-examined. The “Bongo- 
lian mess” was the reason named 
by most of them for crystalliz- 
ing this belief. 

Peking, April 27th. In a for- 
mal warning to President Dr. 
Hodiroy Dabigam, the Chinese 
communist government today 
called for the immediate re- 
lease of any Chinese nationals 
now held by the Bongolians as 
hostages. “Serious consequences 
may result,” the Chinese warn, if 
these hostages are not immedi- 
ately released unharmed. 

Badibax, Bongolia, April 28th. 
President Dr. Hodiroy Dabigam, 
in an impassioned speech to an 
officially estimated half -million 
persons, today declared “bonga- 
nap” (war to the death, and then

the Chinese communists that he 
charged are trying to take over 
the island. 

New York, April 28th. Sodibox 
Gozinaz Hodiroy, head of the 
Bongolian delegation to the U. 
N., today called upon the world 
body to unite in defense of a 
member nation and destroy com- 
munist China. The Chinese, Mr. 
Sodibox declared, are “heavily in- 
vading Bongolia despite heroic 
resistance by the Bongolian armed 
forces.” No action was taken by 
the U. N., pending further infor- 
mation. 

With the 34th Fleet in the 
Straits of Sadinak, April 28th. 
Firing from Bongolia could be 
heard tonight on board ships of 
the 34th Fleet cruising outside 
Bongolian territorial waters. If 
the Chinese are putting fresh “in- 
vasion troops” ashore here, they 
must be landing them from in- 
visible ships. Aerial observation 
all day has revealed nothing re- 
motely like a seaborne invasion 
force. 

Badibax, Bongolia, April 30th. 
President Dr. Hodiroy Dabigam 
announced today that he has as- 
sumed “immediate full control 
over all Bongolian land, sea, air 
and space forces, with the rank of 
Field-Marshal General.” Presi- 



dent Dr. Field-Marshal General 
Hodiroy then announced comple- 
tion of the successful bonganap 
against the Chinese communists 
by a “flank-attack combined with 
reverse enfilade fire by a seaborne 
invasion force of Shock troops un- 
der my direct command.” Presi- 
dent Dr. Field-Marshal General 
Hodiroy then warned all states, 
singly and collectively, to con- 
sider this result of Bongolian 
Armed Forces in action and heed 
the warning. “China,” he said, 
“is a large country. But we have 
defeated her crushingly.” 

Moscow, April 30th. Word of 
the Bongolian statement on their 
“victory” over “Chinese invaders” 
reached a group of leading Soviet 
officials at an informal reception 
here tonight. The Russians made 
no official statement, but were 
reported by the Americans pres- 
ent to have “gone into hysterics” 
after reading the Bongolian vic- 
tory announcement. 

Peking, April 30th. On the eve 
of the big May Day celebration, 
the mood of high officials in this 
capital can only be described by 
the image of a volcano pent up 
under a layer of ice five miles 
thick. 

Washington, May 1st. Ships of 
the U. S. 34th Fleet, operating in 
the Sadinak Straits, are reported 



72 



GALAXY 



to have fished a large number 
of Chinese survivors out of the 
waters off Bongolia. Owing to the 
mutual anti-Bongolian sentiment, 
the Chinese appear to have 
talked freely to U. S. intelligence 
officers. What evidently hap- 
pened was that the Bongolians, 
armed with weapons supplied by 
the Chinese, carried out a night 
sneak attack against the Chinese, 
who were outnumbered and most- 
ly split up into small groups to 
begin with. The Chinese were 
slaughtered piecemeal, no more 
than perhaps one out of five hav- 
ing gotten away, many of these 
seriously wounded. 

New York, May 2nd. At a 
meeting of the Security Council 
today, it was unanimously de- 
cided to take no action on the 
Bongolian charge of Chinese ag- 
gression. 

New York, May 3rd. Sodibox 
Gozinaz Hodiroy, head of the 
Bongolian delegation to the 
United Nations, today announced 
that “the free and soverign nation 
of the Republic of the United 



Bongolias hereby breaks and sev- 
ers all relations with the United 
Nations, unilaterally and irrevoc- 
ably permanently withdraws from 
the United Nations and declares 
‘doziwak’ (this word, “doziwak,” 
does not mean “war” but a pecu- 
liarly devastating insult; it is not 
directly translatable from the 
Bongolian) upon the United Na- 
tions and all the members there- 
of.” Mr. Sodibox, who donned his 
“suit of the fourteen angry heads” 
before speaking, immediately left 
the U. N. Building followed by 
the rest of his delegation. Upon 
leaving the U. N. grounds, Mr. 
Sodibox was at once arrested by 
the New York City police, on 
suspicion of murder. 

New York, May 3rd. The Po- 
lice Commissioner denied today 
that the New York police had 
any intention of releasing Sodibox 
Gozinaz Hodiroy or his accom- 
plices, “till we find out where all 
those dried heads came from. 
They got those heads off of some- 
body. The question is — Who?”

Young Priests 
Adytum 199 

by JAMES McKIMMEY 



They owned their world outright. 
It didn't matter a bit that it was 
only an oasis on a dead planet! 



"peter the Funny sat on a metal 
stool in one of the furthest 
rooms of a north leg of Adytum 
199, gazing fondly at the wooden 
clarinet in his hands. He had dis- 
covered it in a time capsule bur- 
ied in a peak on the western 
range. There had been an anno- 
tation attached, which read : 
“Used by Benny Goodman, dur- 
ing his Carnegie Hall Concert.” 
To Peter there was no historic 
quality in the discovery of an in- 
strument he’d never seen before, 



or of the other memorabilia, such 
as Goodman’s Carnegie Hall al- 
bum as well as his classical re- 
cording of Debussy’s First Rhap- 
sody tor Clarinet with the Phil- 
harmonic Symphony, the baseball 
bat which had cracked out Willy 
Mays’ 715th homer, the original 
draft of John Steinbeck’s Nobel 
Prize speech, the rifle which had 
killed John F. Kennedy, the pair 
of Elvis Presley slacks, the bullet 
believed to be the first fired in the 
War of Viet Nam — all selected 



74 



by a committee assigned to bring 
together a collection of objects 
with a catholic range to represent 
a period of American history 
from 1935 to 1970. 

Peter cared about nothing but 
the clarinet. 

He placed a vintage LP on the 
turntable of the player kept in 
perfect repair by pressing the but- 
ton which brought the Repair 
Robot. He half-closed his eyes 
and silently fingered the pas- 
sages of Goodman’s Sing, Sing, 
Sing solo. When it had been com- 
pleted, he stopped the turntable 
and repeated the same musical 
phrases on the clarinet himself 
— perfectly. 

Then he revised his embouch- 
ure and played an exemplary 
symphonic cadenza, this time em- 
ploying the rounded, flutelike 
tone of the classical musician. 
Not wholly pleased, he repeated 
the phrasing again and again. 

A thin young man, pale from 
his exile in this otherwise aban- 
doned section of the Adytum, he 
wore narrow slacks and a bulky 
knit shirt which he’d worn when 
he’d defected from the Young 
Priests. His hair, which had been 
worn in the long page-boy style 
used by the rest, had repeatedly 
fallen over his eyes during prac- 
tice sessions; he had cut it to a 
bristled close- cropped style more 
practical and comfortable. 

After three hours of in- 



tense, concentrated practice, Peter 
capped the mouthpiece and 
placed the clarinet carefully on 
a bench to walk into another room 
where food buttons lined a metal 
wall. He punched one, then held 
a plastic cup beneath a spigot. 
Synthetic, but nutritious, tomato 
soup poured forth. Before his de- 
fection he could not remember 
having tasted any other food 
than the hamburgers and shakes 
so loved by all the others. 
Here he had experimented; in 
the course of time he had quite 
naturally begun to eat a balanced 
diet. 

Then he returned to his prac- 
tice. 

'Tthe Adytum used twenty-six 
-*• square miles of underground 
space. Built into a tilted plateau 
in the Sierra Nevadas, its tunnels 
twisted through highly compress- 
ed schists and slates, granite and 
dibase, and the later Cretaceous, 
Tertiary sediments and volcan- 
ics. Supreme Government of 
the Western Hemisphere had 
originally evolved the plan and 
managed to maintain reasonable 
secrecy. The public at large was 
not informed of the purpose of 
the Adytums, but rather was led 
to believe that each represented 
a bomb-testing facility. During 
the final year before internation- 
al destruction, panic had mount- 
ed so that mass runs on the un- 



THE YOUNG PRIESTS OF ADYTUM 199

derground facilities would have 
been inevitable, creating impos- 
sible conditions of overcrowding. 
Consequently announcement of 
the availability of the retreats was 
made only after the first missiles 
had been released. Some were in 
deserts. Most were in mountains. 

In the southern section of the 
Adytum the Young Priests walk- 
ed naked through a shower room 
where mechanical arms soaped, 
rinsed and toweled their fat 
bodies to a remarkable state of 
cleanliness. Then, dressed in the 
same costume worn by Peter the 
Funny in his northern-wing re- 
treat, an area of the Adytum dis- 
missed two and a half years ago 
by the group as ‘Crap-land,’ they 
marched into the Burger ’n’ 
Shake Room, where buttons were 
pushed and the consequent re- 
sults were devoured. They sat 
along a table, shouting and laugh- 
ing, twenty females, twenty males. 
The difference in sex was not 
identifiable from a distance, now 
that they were clothed. A discern- 
ing eye would have had to be 
closer. 

As they ate, a steady sound 
came from an eternally running 
tape. It was one which had been 
produced electronically, creating 
a result which resembled a giant 
wind blowing through a clutter of 
loose cymbals, as an overriding 
‘voice’ repeated, “Rabiddity-dow- 
bow, rabiddity-dow-bow.” Par- 

76 



ents who had originally accom- 
panied the Young Priests into the 
Adytum had suggested that the 
sound was a reminder of a deep- 
throated idiot making pleas of 
anguish. But that was before 
Sanguinary Day. 

“Rabiddity-dow-bow,” said one 
of forty. 

“Rabiddity-dow-bow,” said an- 
other. 

“Rabiddity-dow-bow!” called 
the group in symphony. 

I n one of the few habits retain- 
ed from the parental years, the 
group filed into the Dental 
Room, where gentle-handed ro- 
bots scrubbed their teeth effici- 
ently. It was perhaps because of 
this parent-gentleness that the 
habit was retained; it had also 
prevented tooth decay, if not 
obesity. 

The group skipped into the 
Contraception Room to make the 
day safe for frolic. Motivation 
for this was based upon their 
combined philosophy: “Bring a 
kid into this lousy world?” Mater- 
nity Robots waited in the Birth 
Room, flawlessly efficient if 
buttons were pressed. But they 
had been in disuse since the group 
had arrived. 

They dashed down a corridor 
to pick up their Survivo-Instru- 
ments: razor-bladed axes, with 
springing blades shooting from 
the butts of handles. They had 

GALAXV 



been used on Sanguinary Day. 
They were now carried not so 
much out of fear of attack by 
wild animal or alien survivor, 
neither of which they had seen 
for a very long time, but rather 
out of pride — realistic reminders 
of when they had hacked and 
cut apart that which they most 
resented. 

They scampered down a glist- 
ening white corridor to an en- 
trance-exit chamber, where they 
would leave the Adytum without 
effecting the climatizing of the 
structure’s interior. There they 
stood straight and fat, breathing 
easily against the hissing sounds 
of transition. The first time they 
had ventured into this chamber 

— the result of a joint decision 

— they had hunched in fright as 
the process began. There might, 
they had known, have been radi- 
ation at this altitude. But the 
winds had been kind, failing to 
blow the fallout from the dese- 
crated flatlands below. And so ex- 
perience had bred nerve. When 
the broad door slid open, they 
rushed outside boldly, knowing 
that the warm time was precious, 
that winter would come soon, a 
time when they would be restrict- 
ed to the interior until the snows 
again melted. 

Roger, Debra, Sonny, Billy, 
Sue, Ellie, Howie — all forty ran 
along a path covered with dry 
pine needles fallen from trees 

THE YOUNG PRIESTS OF ADYTUM 199 



whose high branches shadowed 
the earth. 

“Wheee!” screamed the girls. 
“Shee — ute!” shouted the 
boys, in manly fashion. 

' IT" he boys wrestled with each 
-®- other, and the girls called en-

craggy and brown with snowy 
tips. The sun was warm in a 
cloud-streaked sky. A lake lay 
in an oval of delicate blue, bor- 
dered by yellow sand. If there 
were wild animals to watch from 
the thick woods, they were too 
canny to reveal proximity, The 
boys and girls did not care. The 
boys wrestled. The girls shrilled. 

Then the boys turned on the 
girls, who shrieked and ran. A 
cry exploded, “Do it!” 

When the young people had 
accomplished that game, they ran 
again, over rocks, over fallen 
trees, through crevices, up and 
down the rises, into the small val- 
lies, up. again, down again, mind- 
lessly, shouting, singing, “Rabid- 
dity-dow-bow . .!” 

They were who remained of 
the original eighty who had been 
the first to enter Adytum 199, 
following the emergency pro- 
clamation. The eighty had repre- 
sented parents and children who 
had been attending Camp All 
Day, whose grounds had been 
but a few miles away. 

The program of the camp had 

77 



been a relatively new innovation, 
though an inevitable one. As 
soon as the families arrived, the 
children were given control by 
the chief camp councillor, an es- 
thetically inclined young man 
named Arthur Pomroy. The chil- 
dren were in the 12-14 age brack- 
et. And it was their privilege to 
lie about in the recreation room, 
watching television, listening to 
their favorite electronic music, 
consuming burgers and shakes, 
as the parents scurried about do- 
ing the various activities assigned 
to them by their children. For 
Mom and Da'd there was a wild 
selection of crafts, skills and ath- 
letic activities to which to de- 
vote themselves: leather work, 
beads, leaf identification, cook- 
ing, archery, boating, swimming, 
track, volley ball — dozens of 
others. 

The singular duty of the chil- 
dren was to make final judg- 
ment upon their parents’ degrees 
of accomplishment. And they 
were a critical jury. Though none 
participated in the various ac- 
tivities in order to know the prob- 
lems of accomplishment, ’ they 
nevertheless were capable of be- 
ing severe in their judgments. A 
mother or father who fell short 
in a given enterprise was given 
a proportionate number of de- 
merits by their children, resulting 
in additional work chores. In or- 
der to please, the parents return- 

78 



ed to their efforts with renewed 
determination. 

117hen the launching of the 
' 'missiles had been announced, 
the campers sped by automobile 
to the Adytum. The adults imme- 
diately organized themselves into 
efficient work groups, as the chil- 
dren gathered in the TV Room to 
watch the store of tapes reserved 
there by the Government. 

It was there that the children 
made the decision. One had 
stretched indolently, watching the 
large screen, and said, “Who 
needs them?” 

An hour later they found the 
closet containing the Survivo-In- 
struments. In a feeling of tender- 
ness it was decided that none 
would have to attack his own 
parents, but rather those of an- 
other. Late that afternoon they 
descended upon the grownups. 
Surprise and shock rendered the 
victims powerless, and it was over 
quickly. Arthur Pomroy, the 
camp councillor and a glib, 
literate allusionist to the end — 
though an inaccurate one, con- 
sidering the female children in- 
volved — was run through by 
one of the blades sprung from the 
butt of a Survivo-Instrument, and 
shouted, “Sanguinary Day, com- 
mitted by the foul young priests 
of Adytum . .!” 

Later, as new arrivals came, 
the Young Priests allowed them 

GALAXY 



to enter an entrance-exit cham- 
ber, then destroyed them. Final- 
ly no more came. The Cremation 
Room was overworked for a time, 
but it had been reliably efficient. 

The Young Priests had lost 
only two of their original young 
band of forty-two. Gabriel had 
stumbled into a crevice and 
broken his leg. He was left there 
until he died three days later, 
then they got him out and threw 
him into the Cremation Room. 
The other was Peter the Funny, 
so named because he was decided- 
ly the peculiar one; he hated 
killing, though he did it; he sang 
strange, self-invented melodies; 
he sometimes failed to play the 
doit game because a girl he want- 
ed more than another was with 
someone else; he was often men- 
tally preoccupied. He wandered 
off by himself, the odd fellow, 
and probably broke a leg as the 
other one had, then died. But it 
didn’t matter to the group, be- 
cause he was odd and funny any- 
way. Nobody had worried about 
Peter since he’d gone. 

Cheeks pink as the cherry milk- 
shakes they consumed, they made 
their way along the rim of a vol- 
canically created basin. A stream 
spilled over rock into a thunder- 
ing falls, the fast-dropping water 
creating a sparkling sheet of icy 
fire against the bright sun. Thick 
vegetation protected the banks 
of the curling stream when they 

THE YOUNG PRIESTS OF ADYTUM 199 



had gone up beyond the falls. 
They leaped, sprawled, frolicked, 
unmindful of the fact that they 
were moving toward the opposite 
end of the Adytum. 

It was only when they came 
over a rise to see the entrance 
to the extending leg of the main 
structure did they realize that 
they had come so far. 

“Crap-land!” said Roger in dis- 
gust. 

“Crap-land!” Debra said in 
total agreement. 

They stared at the door to an 
entrance-exit chamber. Decision 
to abandon this northern section 
of the Adytum had been made 
arbitrarily one day by Billy, who 
had proclaimed dramatically, 
“That is Crap-land!” They had 
never come here since, until now. 
But now Billy said: 

“Lets go in.” 

“Crap-land!” said Ellie, af- 
fronted. 

“‘Was. Now it’s Jn-land!” 

r T~'hey ran to the door and press- 
ed the admitting button. Mo- 
ments later they were running 
through the corridors, intoxicated 
by the rediscovery of that which 
they had once so rigidly rejected. 

They careened through hall- 
way after hallway, until finally 
they heard a strange sound. They 
stopped listening. The girls were 
ready to flee. But Howie whisper- 
ed, “Can’t afford an alien here!” 



79 



Survi vo -Instruments were in 
forty hands. They stalked for- 
ward, pressed by the instinct to 
survive in the fashion they had 
shaped. 

They stopped near a door be- 
hind which the sound originated. 
Roger crept closer, touched a but- 
ton, then jumped back as the 
door slid open. Roger, Debra, 
Sonny, Sue, Billy, Howie — all — 
moved forward to stare in aston- 
ishment at Peter the Funny, sit- 
ting on a stool with his clarinet, 
looking back at them with wide, 
innocent eyes. 

They encircled him. “Thought 
you were dead.” 

“No,” said Peter, shrugging. 
‘“Why’d you cut your hair?” 
Peter was silent. 

‘“You’re skinny.” 

Peter remained silent. 

“Where you been all this 
time?” 

“Here.” 

“In Crap- land?” 

“You’re here,” Peter said simp- 
ly. 

“It was Crap-land,” Billy said 
defensively. “Now it’s /n-land.” 
“Okay,” Peter said. 

“Thought you were dead!” Sue 
shouted. 

“I’m not.” 

“What have you been doing?” 
Peter shrugged again. 

“Why did you run off and 
hide!” Ellie said. 

Peter held up the clarinet. 

80 



“What is it?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“Does it shoot? Kill?” Howie 
asked. 

“Hell, no,” Peter the Funny 
said. “It plays.” 

“Plays?” Roger asked, eyes 
searching the instrument. 

“Let it play!” Sue said, voice 
edged with contempt. 

Peter paused self-consciously, 
then fitted his lips around' the 
mouthpiece. A small vein showed 
on his left temple as he blew. 
A clear, mellow tone of the ex- 
pertly managed instrument pour- 
ed forth; he trilled cadenzas in a 
dazzling display of triumph. He 
stopped. He held the clarinet in 
his hands. 

“Crap!” Billy shouted finally. 

“Crap!” Ellie yelled. 

“Rabiddity-dow-bow!” another 
girl shrilled. 

Peter shrugged a third time, 
no longer looking at them. 

“Where’s the button that 
makes it go!” Howie shouted. 

“There isn’t any!” 

T he room was silent except for 
their breathing as they star- 
ed at the clarinet. 

Peter the Funny said softly. 
“There were old records. I listen- 
ed to them. Then I tried to do it, 
like it sounded. Every day, all 
two years since I found it. There 
isn’t any button. I do it!” 

“Give it to me.” Roger com- 
GALAXY 



manded, stepping closer, his 
round, pink face flushing. 

Peter stared back at him, then 
finally handed him the instru- 
ment. Roger held it clumsily in 
pudgy hands. He examined the 
keys, the pads, the mouthpiece, 
the reed. Finally he put it to his 
lips and blew. The instrument 
growled, squeaked and complain- 
ed. Roger handed it to Billy, who 
got the same results. Sonny tried, 
then gave it back to Peter, order- 
ing grimly, “Make it play!” 

Peter sat sullenly. 

“Make it play!” 



Peter lifted the instrument. A 
cadenza rolled effortlessly, as 
Peter’s fingers flicked with pre- 
cision. 

A Survivd- Instrument cleaved 
the back of his head. Thirty-nine 
other hatchets flashed. When 
there was nothing left but pulp 
and fragmented bone, they broke 
the clarinet into a thousand bits 
and pieces. 

As they ran for the entrance- 
exit chamber, Billy proclaimed 
absolutely, “Crap-land!”

Whoever had brought the Esks to 
Earth had returned for his crop!

D eep within the assassin-proof 
vault, a traditional dragon 
symbolizing good fortune flaunt- 
ed his gold-painted tail above the 
most important telescreen. 

Across this surveillance screen 
moved Chiu Hsing, Saving Star, 
two-door sedans rolling off an as- 
sembly line in distant Shanghai. 
Click, televised from even fur- 
ther south, in Canton well fed 
students in traditional dacron 
robes sprang erect to face a 
blackboard of chemical formulae. 



Click, televised erect as if dis- 
daining underground silos and 
contemptuous of strategic disper- 
sal, protruding here above the 
pink-walled courtyard of Peking’s 
ancient Winter Palace, a gleam- 
ing nose-cone symbolizing — 
“Show what’s really important,” 
Dr. West challenged. “We both 
know what feeds all this — ” 
Tapeworm, you press me too 
much pain, the thought flickered 
faintly within Dr. West’s brain. 

Beside Dr. West, the thin fin- 
gers on the control console re- 
mained obstinately motionless. 



82 



Dr. West could feel the other 
man’s resistance like sparks with- 
in his own skull. Authoritatively, 
Dr. West withdrew his support. 
The opposing face sagged as pa- 
ralysis again spread from its 
stroke-damaged brain. Dr. West 
returned his support, and the nar- 
row eyes widened. 

The two men were alone in the 
Command Vault beneath Peking, 
but they were not alone. 

Jow!” Dr. West commanded 
^ aloud, and beside him the 
unparalyzed fingers moved more 
obediently across the numbered 
pushbuttons on the control con- 
sole. 

Click, on the surveillance 
screen, shimmering across a thou- 
sand miles, appeared the con- 
torted mountains of Szechuan 
Province laboriously terraced. Up 
new tiers of glittering mountain 
rice paddies, swarming shapes 
with hoes clambered into graying 
rain. 

Closer, Dr. West thought. Sig- 
nal for a closer view. 

Beside him the man’s fingers, 
which had been paralyzed, mov- 
ed. Click-click across the thou- 
sand miles, and in Szechuan Pro- 
vince a telelens panned along the 
rain-gray mountain. Across tiny 
rice paddies, beaded along a pre- 
cipice, swept the rain. Dissolving 
mudlips slipped. Whiskered rice 
paddies smaller than bathtubs 



burst down the terraces. Scurry- 
ing Esks struggled to repair dis- 
solving edges with dissolving 
mud. 

The whole cliff’s about to slide. 
Dr. W est thought as the telelens 
zoomed at a random rain-drench- 
ed face. In this moment of peril, 
the surveillance screen was flood- 
ed by the Esk’s infuriatingly 
senseless grin. 

“Dammit, even now, that one’s 
looking North!” Dr. West shout- 
ed, his body tightening in another 
of his uncontrollable surges of 
rage and frustration. “Every day. 
More and more Esks looking at 
the sky.” His voice choked as his 
breathing squeezed agonizingly 
tight. His rage or fear was mak- 
ing his heart muscle wince. 

Beside him at the console the 
thin hand contracted like a dying 
spider. Dr. West felt his own pain 
reflected from Mao III as they 
both gasped for breath. He blink- 
ed at Mao Ill’s loud-gasping face, 
now waxen above the luxurious 
black dacron robe. 

Instinctively, Dr. West’s hand 
slid another tiny white pill under 
his own tongue. It was 'his heart, 
not Mao Ill’s. The stinging sen- 
sation beneath his tongue helped 
him relax even before the .32 mg. 
nitroglycerine tablet dissolved, 
diffused, reopened the constricted 
arteries within the cramped mus- 
cle which was his heart. He re- 
laxed, sheathed with sweat. 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 



83 



Beside him the partially para- 
lyzed Mao III regained his 
breathing rhythm, emitting rhy- 
thmic hissing sounds in the Com- 
mand Vault 4,000 feet beneath 
Peking. 

On the telescreen the random 
Esk still stood grinning at the sky 
as if symbolizing a billion, two 
billion Esks spreading over the 
world, all smiling into space. 

“There is nothing up there but 
sky,” Dr. West muttered. 

U nconscious of the surveillance 
lens, the Esk .bent his rain- 
washed back once more, and his 
obedient hands scooped mud 
upon the dissolving rim of the rice 
terrace. Beside him worked a 
child, and another child, dozens 
of Esk children working rhythmi- 
cally in the rain. 

So much more quickly matur- 
ing than Chinese children, they 
appeared to be twelve-year-olds. 
Dr. West estimated this swarm 
of children had been born two 
years ago. In another year they 
would be reproducing babies of 
their own. The first Esks had 
needed 5 years to mature. Recent 
generations were maturing in 3 
years. Faster and faster! 

“You fool!” Dr. West shouted 
at Mao III. “You still insist they 
are human. But such inhumanly 
efficient mothers and embryos! 
A one month gestation period?” 
Dr. West shuddered. “Human?” 



All over the once barren moun- 
tains and marginal deserts of Chi- 
na, the spreading Esk population 
under Chinese control was hand- 
working the sand, rock and thin 
soil. After Dr. West had paracap- 
suled down in Szechuan Province, 
he had witnessed Esks terracing 
mountains so steep a Chinese 
commune worker would starve. 

Up there. Dr. West thought, 
even a man’s hardest labor could 
not produce the equivalent of 
1,800 calories of rice energy each 
day he needs to keep him work- 
ing and alive. 

Yet these smiling Esks were 
eating less than 600 calories of 
rice energy each day and working 
strongly. On submarginal land 
where Chinese commune workers 
would have starved, these Esks 
were producing a lice surplus. 

“You fool!” Dr. West glared at 
Mao III. “Do you still think you 
are leaping fifty years of Marx- 
ist-Maoist agricultural frustra- 
tion? Yes, you have a rice surplus 
this year. Yes, you are elbowing 
into world trade. With surplus 
rice, you are filling the bellies of 
Chinese industrial workers and 
troops all over Southeast Asia and 
spreading west. You are increas- 
ing the Esks to produce an even 
bigger agricultural surplus next 
year, but the Principle of Dimin- 
ishing Returns is not an econom- 
ist’s myth. And the ghost breath- 
ing on your neck is Malthus.” 



84 



GALAXY 



That discredited 18 th-Century 
English pessimist, Mao Ill’s 
thoughts taunted, who did not 
foresee the scientific improvement 
of agriculture or the — 

“How can you talk about scien- 
tific agriculture?” Dr. West 
shouted and recovered his breath. 
“Even assuming scientific agri- 
culture in the sea, this planet has 
limits! The human population is 
only doubling every twenty-five 
years. We both know the Esk 
population is doubling every year 
in China.” 

Dr. West stared at Mao Ill’s 
lopsidedly smiling face and added 
bitingly : “Are you master or tool? 
The first few Esks did not appear 
in the Arctic because Maoist the- 
ology wished them there.” 

At this, Mao Ill’s thought-pro- 
jection turned as blank as Arctic 
ice. 

I f there is a purpose in life, Dr. 

West thought and oddly vis- 
ualized a spinning globe with a 
Geographic North Pole set in the 
white Arctic Ocean and, rotating 
closely around it, the bare rocks 
of Canada’s Boothia Peninsula, 
present locus of the Earth’s mag- 
netic lines of force, of the North 
Magnetic Pole. There he had dis- 
covered the first few grinning 
Eskimos who were not — 

“What are they?” Dr. West 
croaked, his thoughts circling 
back in the old rut. So nonviolent, 



so obedient, so happily increasing 
as if they can feel their purpose 
approaching. Always smiling, no 
matter what we do to them, as if 
they feel their purpose approach- 
ing. Closer every day. “What is 
their purpose? Their purpose 
can’t be our purpose!” 

He stared at Mao III. 

No purpose, Mao Ill’s thoughts 
derided Dr. West with startling 
humor for a paralytic, who was 
gasping for breath. No purpose 
anywhere. End purpose of Uni- 
verse when I die equals nothing. 
No ten thousand years of Mao- 
ism. Nothing. So you cannot 
frighten me with too many Esks. 

Mao Ill’s throat corded with 
effort, and he managed to gasp 
aloud. “Nothing frightens me af- 
ter what you did to me, my brain 
tapeworm. You — ” His voice 
was cut off. 

Dr. West’s forehead wrinkled 
with effort, as Mao Ill’s voice 
gurgled to silence. But Mao Ill’s 
thoughts like javelins penetrated 
Dr. West. 

My power is nothing. Squirm, 
my tapeworm. So shrewd, their 
plan to invade me with you. But 
your success is nothing. Mao Ill’s 
face contorted like a smile. 
Squirm in this intestine of power, 
my tapeworm. You a new leader? 
I laugh. Since the beginning of 
time, the world has been impos- 
sible. What can you do? 

Dr. West’s thoughts and body

tightened defensively, and Mao 
Ill’s face sagged. His transmitted 
thoughts were blurred by pain. 
Dr. West watched him gasping for 
breath. It would be catastrophic 
to let him die. 

Cold with sweat, Dr. West 
squirmed on the console chair. 
Instructions must have been given 
me, his thoughts revolved, in case 
1 succeeded like this. 

He moaned with motionless ef- 
fort turned inward. There was no 
coherent clue to his net line of 
action. His memory seemed torn 
apart. 

He knew the electrointerroga- 
tion after his “capture” had con- 
tributed to his present disorgani- 
zation. And this symbiotic rela- 
tionship — Mao III was cursing it 
as parasitic — must be disorgan- 
izing both of them. 

His dreams — until he began 
giving Mao III sleeping pills, Mao 
Ill’s dreams had awakened him. 

T he pink walls enclosing the 
Great Square had echoed 
from marching troops which 
awakened Dr. West, who imagin- 
ed it was his own dream. Then 
dim ranks of children wearing red 
bandanas around their throats 
had passed through Dr. West’s 
mind even though he was awake. 
Endless ranks of children with 
red balloons, white balloons, and 
Dr. West felt a growing sensation 
of joy and pride. Mao III must 



be watching them from his dream. 
“Mao Tse-Tung, wan shui! Mao 
Tse-Tung wan shui!” their shrill 
voices shouted. “ May Mao Tse- 
Tung live ten thousand years!” 

In unison the balloons in the 
dream were released. But Mao 
Tse-tung had been dead for near- 
ly fifty years. Mao III must have 
been an unknown young man 
then. Dr. West realized that Mao 
III was dreaming of his youth 
before the interregnum of com- 
mittees and armies which fol- 
lowed the death of Mao Tse- 
Tung. 

The following fatherly figure, 
Mao II, had been a desperation 
figurehead. But Mao III was here 
in the Command Vault, whether 
in command of China or subtly 
trapped by a coalition of gener- 
als, Dr. West still was unable to 
determine. 

“Command into the telecomm,” 
Dr. West blurted. “Speak to your 
interrogators on the surface who 
failed to protect you from me. 
Order them to prepare any Esk. 
I — you want to ask that Esk one 
question.” 

Mao Ill’s breath hissed out, 
and Dr. West allowed the para- 
lyzed hands to move across the 
console. 

Without Dr. West’s mental 
concentration, Mao Ill’s stroke- 
paralyzed body was useless sinew, 
skin and bones. Now it moved as 
if Mao III still were in command. 



86 



GALAXY 



II 



Such a small decision, Mao 
Ill’s thought derided. To ques- 
tion an Esk. For twenty years we 
have been peeling their brains 
like onions to find nothing. They 
are simply mutated Eskimos. 
Nothing more. 

As Mao Ill’s finger stabbed a 
pattern of buttons, Dr. West de- 
tected no . discernible treachery in 
Mao Ill’s thoughts. Colossal con- 
tempt merged from Mao III: 
Tapeworm, you will learn that 
Esks contain no magical racial 
memory. What magical question 
can you ask? My technicians have 
questioned them electrically until 
I was ill from the smell of char- 
ring flesh. 

Such innocent people Esks 
cannot even begin to think of lies 
to confess. 

There was a humming from the 
communications contact with the 
surface interrogation clinic, and 
Dr. West allowed Mao Ill’s voice 
to speak. What emerged were Dr. 
West’s orders. 

The distant answer: “Within 
fifteen minutes an Esk will be 
positioned and ready for ques- 
tions, Chiu Hsing.” Click. 

Dr. West’s eyebrows rose. “Chiu 
Hsing, an honorific title meaning 
Saving Star? That also is the 
name of your mass-production 
automobile.” 

Dr. West laughed softly as 
Mao III peered questioningly at 
him. 



W ith the dignity of a mandar- 
in, Mao III nodded. “I gave 
happiness.” 

As he detected the derision in 
Dr. West’s thoughts, Mao III 
scowled. “You are a monomaniac, 
convicted fifteen years ago of at- 
tempted Eskimo genocide,” Mao 
Ill’s voice rushed as if he ex- 
pected Dr. West to shut him off. 
“You would not be here if I had 
not suffered my brain-stroke, 
false doctor. You have such little 
plans. To question an Esk until 
he dies. Listen, my tapeworm, the 
deepest words you will excavate 
from a stupid Esk are their incor- 
rect Arctic myths, a confusion of 
bear worship and imperialist 
Bible fables.” 

Mao III smiled. “Maoist 
science has proved Esks are noth- 
ing but mutated Eskimos.” His 
voice shrilled. “You fraud, per- 
haps you were in the Arctic when 
the Esks still were few. But it is 
I who saw the future for China, 
who ordered the rescue of a hun- 
dred Esks from Canadian starva- 
tion.” 

“And twenty years later you 
have a billion.” 

“They are as human as I am, 
and more human than you, you 
genocidal maniac.” Mao III gasp- 
ed for breath. 

As Dr. West mentally strangled 
his speech, Mao Ill’s thoughts

continued attacking. Tapeworm, 
you are sitting in my Command 
Vault as if you imagine you con- 
trol the greatest organized power 
on Earth. Yet your mind is so 
small, you are planning to waste 
time personally interrogating, yes, 
torturing one little Esk. 

Dr. West said nothing. Finally 
he nodded his head. “As you say, 
the questioning is a small step. A 
larger step will follow.” Dr. West 
improvised, forcing his weary 
smile at Mao III. “You are going 
to reappear before the world.” 

That plan now elaborated so 
swiftly in Dr. West’s mind he 
thought he accidentally must 
have cued some original hypno- 
instructions. “You are going to 
reappear before the telecamera 
to demonstrate that your rumor- 
ed retirement, nice word, is false. 
You have recovered from the ru- 
mored stroke. You are going to 
ask for an international telecon- 
ference between you and — ” 

No name automatically was 
formed in Dr. West’s voice. Dr. 
West blinked. Nothing flowed, 
no well ordered plan from his 
damaged memory. If the Harvard 
Circle had implanted further in- 
structions in case he reached Mao 
III, they were erased. He was 
alone. Had he always been alone? 

“The subject of the teleconfer- 
ence will be — ” Dr. West waited. 
Nothing. He made his own deci- 
sion based on his own beliefs of 



thirty years. “You will propose a 
split-screen teleconference with 
the President of the United 
States. Before a world audience 
you will negotiate for internation- 
al population control of the 
Esks.” 

Ti/Tao III laughed aloud with 
* ’ surprise. “Your monomania 
reappears in another new dis- 
guise. Impossible ideal. More im- 
possible than weapons control.” 

IVJao Ill’s smile became mali- 
cious. “The United States could 
never agree to limitation of your 
Esk population. You look star- 
tled, my tapeworm. Either our 
electrointerrogation burned holes 
in your memory, or those murder- 
ous plotters in the C.I.A. neglect- 
ed to correctly inform you what 
has happened in the United 
States during the last fifteen 
years.” 

Dr. West blinked in confusion. 

“Don’t you remember where 
you — slept during the last fifteen 
years?” Mao III persisted. “At 
least I have seen your dossier. Do 
I know more than you? The New 
China News Agency knows where 
you were. Fifteen years ago, in 
Canada you were convicted of 
genocide, as the whole outraged 
world remembers. You were cod- 
dled in the New Ottawa Refor- 
mation Center. For some reason, 
which I do not know, soon you 
were moved punitively to what 



88 



GALAXY 



Canadians euphemistically refer 
to as The Cold Room. So you 
can’t know what’s truly happen- 
ed. You’ve been asleep for fifteen 
years. Were you startled to awak- 
en in the United States? You 
confessed to my own interroga- 
tors that you regained conscious- 
ness in a large basement room in 
a large building across the river 
from Washington.” 

Mao III laughed. “The imper- 
ialists finally had a use for you 
— you mass murderer. Y ou were 
stolen from an indeterminant sen- 
tence, rescued because one of 
your former colleagues in popula- 
tion control research had a new 
job.” 

Dr. West blinked. A circle of 
faces had peered down at him. 
Familiar? He 'had been startled 
how old Fred looked. Beside him 
the embarrassed man with the 
hypo appeared so old. “Sammy!” 
It was Dr. Sam Wynoski, still a 
consultant in chemopsychiatry 
for government agencies. After 
“Therapeutic Adjustment” they 
had taken him upstairs to the 
Assistant Director, who was — 

Dr. West tensed. “I know all 
that, I know all that, the Harvard 
Circle!” he shouted as if in guilt. 
“Shut up or I’ll stop your breath- 
ing.” 

But I have said so little, Mao 
Ill’s thoughts persisted. Now you 
have proper negative feelings be- 
cause the C.I.A. used you as 



mechanistically as a guided mis- 
sile. Blind tapeworm, never were 
you told what is happening. I am 
going to show you what truly is 
happening in the United States. 

His skeletal hand crept across 
the console toward the telescreen 
controls. Tapeworm, the United 
States no longer is what they de- 
scribed to you. Those imperialis- 
tic warmongers never let you out 
of the Central Intelligence Agen- 
cy building to see — 

With a frightened thought, Dr. 
West stopped Mao Ill’s hand on 
the television controls. 

The worst sin is ignorance, Mao 
Ill’s thoughts slashed. 

“Your attempt is — to confuse 
me,” Dr. West gasped. “Trying 
to disorient me, so I’ll lose my — 
need to take action, lose my de- 
sire to control you.” 

My motive is exactly that, Mao 
III thought calmly, but facts are 
true regardless of the motive of 
the one who brings them to your 
attention. Let your eyes see 
truth, see tele-broadcasts relayed 
from our satellites stationed above 
America and films made by en- 
lightened tourists. 

Dr. West’s throat tightened. “I 
reject your attack. I don’t want 
— ” He closed his eyes. “Give or- 
ders through your foreign office,” 
Dr. West shouted. “Now! Trans- 
mit to your so-called ambassador 
in Warsaw, to make an offer, an. 
ultimatum for a teleconference

within one week with the Presi- 
dent of the United' States.” 

iixxrhat a beautiful flower,” 
’ ’Mao III exhaled after Dr. 
West had released his voice “is 
each moment of life. Particularly 
beautiful is the last flower seen 
by a mountain climber whose grip 
is weakening on the precipice of 
life. I am that climber, and you 
are roped to me, tapeworm. My 
military could not approve of 
such a conference.” 

“I don’t give a damn what your 
generals approve.” 

“But the art of government is 
quite complex. During the three 
years since my first brain -stroke, 
the generals have been watching 
each other while waiting for me 
to die.” Mao Ill’s face contorted. 
“Already there must be rumors of 
your presence in this hole, my 
faith-healer, but each general has 
hesitated to take action because 
this would arouse the suspicions 
of the others as to his real pur- 
pose.” 

Mao III smiled. “My pure- 
hearted generals! Each man 
dreams of the power to save the 
world. Each desires the empty 
thing which is down here in the 
Command Vault.” 

Dr. West said nothing. 

“Is it power or the ghost of 
power?” Mao III laughed. “Now 
if I disappoint my generals and 
tell them that my health has been 



regained, that I plan to embark 
on a revisionist foreign policy 
without their guidance, that I in- 
tend to recognize and dignify the 
existence of the United States by 
engaging in a teleconference with 
that barbarian assassin whose 
capital is Hollywood, or Toledo 
or Washington, my generals will 
conclude I have gone mad or 
have been captured by a rumored 
non-Chinese faith-healer. My gen- 
erals will be forced to unite and 
rescue me.” 



Dr. West glanced at the ceiling. 
Supposedly, it was 4,000 feet to 
the surface.

ing down through the concrete 
slab beneath the Winter Palace. 
Twenty -five years ago when my 
power was democratically con- 
firmed, I ordered construction of 
this vault as a patriotic base 
against an imperialist or Russian 
revisionist pre-emptive nuclear 
attack. It was designed so that 
revisionist assassins could not 
fight their way down to this vault. 
Under the concrete surface cap 
was entombed the device. Since 
then the architects of my vault’s 
defense have died. But shrewd 
drilling might disconnect this 
small device. An overimaginative 
general once intimated that I hold 
the whole city of Peking a hos- 
tage against my assassination. 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 



91 



But truly it is a very small device 
only intended to seal off entry 
to this vault. Not even the Inner 
City would be obliterated.” 
Where is the detonation con- 
trol? Dr. West thought. 

Mao III shrugged. “If the gen- 
erals and my loyal surface guard 
and the civil police and my Party 
police all could agree to trust one 
another, it would be a simple 
matter to drill down a series of 
exploratory holes and eventually 
disconnect the device.” 

Dr. West found himself listen- 
ing for the elevator. 

“Careful technicians with small 
loss of life should be able to lo- 
cate the alarms and gas jets in 
the long shaft even though all 
plans were burned twenty years 
ago when the architects were li- 
quidated.” Mao III laughed like 
a pleased young boy. “Then sol- 
diers can be lowered on long ca- 
bles. It would be fatal to use the 
elevator as long as I — ” Mao III 
inadvertently visualized a switch 
on the control console. “Pull it 
and immobilize the elevator if 
you panic. But the soldiers will 
come down on ropes. They will 
push my servants aside because 
my servants are non-violent, even 
too innocent to poison me.” 

“Then all your servants down 
here are Esks,” Dr. West said. 

“The soldiers will push my ser- 
vants aside and rescue me — from 
you.” 



“Then, welcome them,” Dr. 
West retorted. “If this is what 
will happen, you should be happy 
to start the flow of events. Sim- 
ply give orders to prepare for the 
teleconference. Now give the or- 
ders!” 

Mao III sighed. “You still lack 
the subtle understanding neces- 
sary for a leader who desires to 
continue his long reign. Let me 
explain to you — ” 

D r West’s brow wrinkles deep- 
ened, and Mao III cried out 
as his terrible cranial pain echoed 
dizzily into Dr. West, who re- 
laxed the pain. If he killed the 
old man he would be left with 
— nothing. 

“ — with nothing,” Mao III 
gasped, “for either of us. The gen- 
erals will come down to rescue 
something from you, my tape- 
worm. Not me, my power. For 
them, my living body will be an 
embarrassment like a mangy 
dog.” He laughed bitterly. “But 
a dead leader can be used as a 
political martyr, you — C.I.A. as- 
sassin.” 

“Goddammit, give the orders 
for the teleconference!” Dr. West 
repeated. 

Mao III bleated in pain, and 
Dr. West had to wait for the 
grayness to clear from Mao Ill’s 
brain. 

“Consider,” Mao III whispered 
and a managed a twisted smile. 



92 



GALAXY 



“What is the simplest way to rid 
an old dog of his tapeworm? It is 
to smash his skull and give him 
a glorious funeral through the 
Great Square of Peking. This is 
the way I would like to die; but 
consider, are either of us ready?” 

Dr. West’s rage whirled Mao 
Ill’s thoughts into gray confu- 
sion. 

Unexpectedly, Dr. 'West 
glimpsed Mao Ill’s visualization 
of an inconspicuous keyhole, a 
locked panel in the console. Now 
Mao III imagined an earthquake 
rumbling from the surface as he 
twisted in pain, and Dr. West felt 
the childhood clutch of claustro- 
phobia. Mao III really would turn 
the key, detonating the nuclear 
device, erupting the Winter Pal- 
ace, sealing them 4,000 feet be- 
neath Peking. Where was the 
key? 

Dr. West knelt beside Mao Ill’s 
contorted body on the floor and 
lifted the silver snakechain from 
his neck, drawing out of the black 
dacron robe the skin-tarnished 
key. My control isn't as all-en- 
compassing as I thought. I never 
detected the existence of the key, 
but perhaps you never thought of 
it until now — I hope. 

He hung the key around his 
own neck. 

When Dr. West helped Mao 
Ill’s limp body back onto the 
chair in front of the console, he 
could detect no more mental re- 



sistance. Mao Ill’s surprisingly 
determined resistance to a tele- 
conference seemed at an end. His 
thin fingers depressed the proper 
buttons on the console. His sag- 
ging lips mouthed Dr. West’s or- 
ders to the Chinese Foreign Of- 
fice, and Dr. West warmed with 
excitement as he heard his orders 
being transmitted into action. 



A lthough the Chinese Federa- 
tion of Nations now held 
three seats in the United Nations 
General Assembly, and their dac- 
ron red-and-black robes no long- 
er attracted tourist attention 
within the glass-walled U. N. 
sanctuary on Manhattan Island, 
all diplomatic contact with the 
United States was carried on 
within the Catholic Capitalism 
Principality of Warsaw. The U.S. 
Ambassador in Warsaw was in- 
vited to sit in secret session with 
his Chinese counterpart. Nego- 
tiations leading toward the inter- 
national teleconfrontation had be- 



gun. 

“Tapeworm, you are wastefully 
sacrificing your life and mine be- 
cause your president will not 
agree to face me in a television 
debate.” 

“Wishful thinking on your part. 
Signal your interrogators on the 
surface. What happened to that 
Esk who was supposed to be 
readied for me to question?” 

“Let me show you telecasts of 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 



93 



the situation of the Esks through- 
out the United States.” 

“No!” Dr. West shouted with 
unexplainable rage and pain. 
“Show me the Esk in the inter- 
rogation room.” 

A shuffling sound caused Dr. 
West to whirl. False alarm. An 
Esk servant had wandered into 
the Control Room carrying the 
afternoon tea tray. Dr. West ig- 
nored this Esk. 

On the telescreen appeared the 
frightened face of a Chinese in- 
terrogation technician, confessing 
there had been minor technical 
difficulties in wiring the Esk’s 
frontal lobes. There would be an- 
other short delay. 

Dry-mouthed, Dr. West waited 
for his tea to cool, waited for 
Mao III to drink first, noisily. 

“Tapeworm, I am alive because 
my Esks prepare my meals. Do 
you consider Esks inhuman be- 
cause they not only eschew vio- 
lence, they are too innocent to 
poison — ” 

“Why should they bother to 
poison you? They’re poisoning the 
whole world with sheer num- 
bers.” 

“You’re hysterical and stupid. 
Your Esk strapped on the table 
up there will be as unable to ex- 
plain the purpose or lack of pur- 
pose of the Esks as you or I 
would be if we were tortured to 
explain the purpose of Man on 
this Earth.” 



“Is your strategy,” Dr. West re- 
torted, “to argue against anything 
I try to do? By deriding me are 
you trying to erode my self-con- 
fidence? Are you trying to wear 
me down? I’m so much stronger 
than you, you won’t escape that 
way!” 

“Your president cannot agree 
to confront me in a teleconference 
if the agenda includes the inter- 
national problem of population 
limitation of the Esks. He is a 
practical man, as practical as I 
am, and he will create an excuse, 
an incident to avoid facing me in 
a teleconference if the subject is 
to be population control of the 
Esks. Tapeworm, let-mc show you 
the United States. I will show 
you why your president cannot 
agree to — ” 

“Shut up!” Dr. West turned 
away and closed his eyes. The 
President would welcome another 
international teleconfrontation. 
His thoughts had the sound of 
another man’s voice.

the President took it up,” George 
Bruning had said. “A fresh inno-

macy.” Dr. West blinked. George 
Bruning had been briefing him as 
to the 15 years he’d missed, con- 
servatively an all-afternoon pro- 
ject. 

Evidently George had managed 
to extend his own influence far 
beyond the Harvard Circle of the 
C.I.A. “Ages ago when Paul and 
I — the President and I were in 
the Hasty Pudding Club — that’s 
at Harvard, I said Paul you ought 
to enter politics. At nineteen 
you’re already a greater actor 
than Lincoln.” George Bruning 
had leaned toward Dr. West. 
“Both our international telecon- 
frontations made use of our U.S. 
Information Agency relay satel- 
lites blanketing the Earth — split- 
screen, each leader in his own 
country, almost face-to-face — 
instant audio translations from a 
hundred satellites covering the 
world. They saw it all. The BIG 
audience! And both times the 
President scored!” 

“The first time, the President 
was a little nervous even thought 
we’d dug a pitfall for the Pre- 
mier.” George Bruning had smil- 
ed shyly. 

“As for the Premier, he had a 
small country, and he wanted the 
world-wide advertising the broad- 
cast offered; but before accepting 
he was extremely cautious. May- 
be he’d read U.S. history, the 
Kennedy-Nixon debates, little 
pitfalls of television. The Premier 



accepted only three of our sug- 
gested subjects for discussion: 
coffee prices, weather control and 
the international student ex- 
change program. 

“Harmless subjects,” George 
Bruning added smoothly, “but at 
least the personalities of both 
men would be exposed to the 
world.” 

“To our horror the Premier 
projected great dignity, an up- 
standing man, which he was not. 
Our President — what a warm 
personality! As a former motion- 
picture actor, Paul really knows 
how to come across. But it would 
have been a stand-off.” George 
Bruning frowned. “1 crawled un- 
derneath the President’s tele- 
prompter, gave him the pics. 

“My agency had — acquired 
the pics. Since students were the 
final subject for discussion, the 
international student exchange, 
the President needed our pics of 
certain students the Premier had 
selected for exchange from his 
small country. 

“The Premier had assured their 
relatives that the student leaders 
merely had been exiled; because 
of the March he had benevolently 
sent them to China as part of the 
student exchange program. Al- 
ready their relatives had been re- 
ceiving enthusiastic, but typed 
postcards from China. They liked 
China so well they might never 
return, the postcards said.” 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE

. until our President held 
up the pics to the T.V. camera, 
clearly revealing to the world the 
students and the wall and the 
easily recognizable building be- 
hind. The mob dug up the bodies 
of the students while the Premier 
was trying to escape from the 
other side of his Capitol Build- 
ing. The new government is much 
more acceptable to the C.I.A.” 

“. after that, another telecon- 
frontation with another Head of 
State was difficult to arrange. 
Necessarily, its arrangement was 
more subtle. The President lost, 
as promised. Like billiards — 
pool, you know — like a hustler. 
We’re looking ahead to the big 
one.” 

r T''here was a buzzing sound, 
and Dr. West blinked. A yel- 
low communications light was 
flashing on the control console. 

“Do you still desire to attempt 
your useless interrogation of an 
Esk?” The voice beside him was 
Mao Ill’s. 

On the telescreen gleamed a 
white room with white-gowned 
figures bending over a surgical 
table. Dr. West winced at the 
similarity. It could have been the 
same room in which he had been 
interrogated. Now the viewpoint 
from the closed-circuit T.V. sys- 
tem shifted to a high lens looking 
down from the ceiling. Dr. West 
remembered staring up from the 



table at the ceiling grille with a 
camera lens glinting behind it, 
while cold hands forced wired 
needles into his skull, conscious- 
ness faded. 

On the table, the Esk’s eyelids 
were creeping closed. His shaven 
head glittered, a pincushion with 
a tangle of wires leading to the 
electrosensitizer and the reaction 
dials. As the electric current in- 
creased, the Esk lolled his head 
from side to side. Wide-cheeked, 
with a massive lower jaw, barrel 
chest and short legs, physically 
this Esk resembled an Eskimo. 

One of the white-capped fig- 
ures twisted a knob, and the Esk’s 
eyes snapped open. Dr. West rec- 
ognized the humming sound and 
the distant voice questioning. In 
Chinese, the Esk mumbled his 
name, a Chinese name, and the 
name of the Esk seggrecommune 
where he labored. 

A technician glanced up mean- 
ingfully at the camera lens. 

Dr. West swallowed convulsive- 
ly. How to begin? 

T apeworm, Chinese electro- 
cranial accupuncture is at your 
service, Mao’s thoughts derided 
him. You have only to think, and 
my mouth is happy to question 
this Esk, a hundred Esks; every 
conceivable question already has 
been asked. 

Mao Ill’s thoughts collapsed as 
Dr. West intruded strongly, and 
Mao Ill’s mouth hesitantly form-

ed a word. Mao Ill’s voice spoke 
in Modem Eskimo, a language 
he did not know. “llaga, my 
friend,” Mao III spoke as Dr. 
West thought. “Nanuktuakjung, 
little bear, Grandfather Bear ap- 
proaching — ” 

Dr. West’s thoughts poured 
from Mao Ill’s mouth while the 
Esk’s eyes gradually closed. Dr. 
West stopped, distressed. 

He fails to understand you, 
Mao III thought maliciously. He 
is culturally Chinese. Of course 
he can’t understand Eskimo. He 
was born in China, and three 
years before that his grandfather 
was born in China, and three 
years before that his great-grand- 
father was born in China, and 
perhaps his great-great grand- 
father was one of the first hun- 
dred underprivileged Eskimos the 
Chinese Federation of Nations, at 
my orders, rescued from Canada 
some fifteen years ago. 

Dr. West concentrated, squeez- 
ing aside Mao Ill’s thoughts. 

“Grandfather Bear is approach- 
ing,” Mao Ill’s mouth shouted. 
Dr. West’s thoughts, this time in 
Chinese. “Great White Bear from 
the sky,” Mao Ill’s voice help- 
lessly hissed through the micro- 
phone at the Esk, and Dr. West’s 
memories of the original little 
group of Eslcs telling night stories 
of the bear in the sky poured 
from Mao Ill’s mouth with in- 
creasing intensity. “He will come. 



Grandfather Bear coming down 
from the sky. He hungers for us 
with joy. With joy, all will be 
one.” 

' I 'he Esk’s eyes widened in ec- 
-*• stasy, his mouth opening. 
“Grandfather Bear, Grandfather 
Be — , Grandfather Dragon-Ti- 
ger!” 

Dragon-tiger? Dr. West thought 
with disgusted surprise and glanc- 
ed at Mao III. 

Dragons, tigers, Chinese sym- 
bols of spiritual power have over- 
laid the fading Bear symbol. Mao 
Ill’s smugness enclosed Dr. West. 
My tapeworm, your Polar Bear 
symbol is nothing more than an 
animistic relic of prehistoric Es- 
kimo beliefs polluted by capital- 
ist Biblical underexposure. Noth- 
ing more. Did you think — 

“Grandfather Bear is coming 
down from the sky. Prepare this 
world,” Dr. West’s voice-thoughts 
surged from Mao III into the 
microphone, and the Esk lolled 
his head from side to side, and 
Dr. West paused, trying to re- 
member the night igloo, and out 
under the Arctic stars. 

No matter how deeply you in- 
terrogate this lump of flesh, no 
matter how ridiculously you try 
to trigger his racial memory, Mao 
Ill’s thoughts taunted, he can tell 
you nothing new. How can he 
tell you secrets of a World Be- 
yond when the only imprint 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE

within him is from this humble 
world? 

One of the white-capped tech- 
nicians glanced up at the ceiling- 
camera, and gradually the elec- 
trosensitization of the Esk’s cere- 
brum was being increased while 
Dr. West’s thoughts spoke, 
through Mao III. Dr. West was 
reproducing the religious excite- 
ment of Edwardluk twenty years 
ago. 

“Grandfather Bear approach- 
ing, closer and closer as we in- 
crease. He is coming! Our bodies 
are preparing the world for him. 
His great hunger is for us. Our 
bodies will reward him for our 
birth!” 

The Esk’s voice squealed. 

Abruptly, the Esk’s pulse rate 
jumped to 150 per minute as his 
smile opened in a shout. “Grand- 
father, I — we altogether in you.” 
His face strained with joy and 
tears. It almost seemed as if his 
hair was standing on end in a 
static-electric effect as he relived 
the myth his father must have 
told him. “Grandfather, come 
down! We prepare world for you! 
For you we are ripening — ” 

The white gowns flurried about 
the Esk. On the table they were 
giving him oxygen resuscitation. 
Now external heart massage. 

A lot of them die like that, Mao 
III thought. Wasted, I suppose 
due to an electrosensitization ov- 
erload. 



A white-robed technician glanc- 
ed up at the camera as if in 
frightened apology. 

Dr. West sat there sweating. He 
stared at Mao III. “After I rest 
we will question another Esk.” 
Dr. West’s voice rose with ex- 
citement. “I don’t believe this 
Esk died from incompetent elec- 
trosensitization. If Esks could be 
made to die, triggered by mental 
suggestion, maybe something 
coming down from the sky? Did 
you ask astronomers? I, he died 
so happily as if — ” 

“He was electrocuted,” Mao 
III taunted, and he released a 
hail of words upon Dr. West’s 
weariness. “Tapeworm, Pavlovian 
cues such as the wave of a flag 
can cause a soldier to leap up 
into machine gun bullets. Other 
triggers such as the news of the 
death of a loved one can cause 
a man, already subject to arter- 
iosclerosis, to fall down with a 
heart attack, and so a sudden 
gust of wind plucks an over-ripe 
fruit.” 

Mao Ill’s voice rose. “Even if 
you triggered that Esk to die, this 
does not prove that your words 
or his belief had Marxist-Mater- 
ialist reality, or even that other 
Esks can be psychophysically 
conditioned to ripeness for such 
nonsense. All Maoist Esks know 
there is nothing physical Out 
There In The Sky which desires

stand on scientific dialectical log- 
ic. In any case, that childishly 
suggestible Esk will be proved to 
have died of too much electricity, 
which is a physical force — ” Mao 
III stammered, as Dr. West was 
able to shut off his physical 
voice. 

T>ut Mao Ill’s thoughts swept 
on like an erosive river. 
Tapeworm, we both should ad- 
mit that Esks simply are mutated 
Eskimos, human beings like our- 
selves, merely more fecund and 
more obedient. Listen to me, my 
tapeworm, subconsciously you 
have been searching for excuses 
to murder Esks. You want proof 
they are not human so it will 
salve your conscience for the 
mass murder you consummated 
fifteen years ago. With imperial- 
ist-cultured bacteria you almost 
succeeded in Eskimo genocide. 
lt / as it 21 Eskimos died? Before 
the eyes of the world you were 
convicted of mass murder. Even 
in the most reactionary capitalist 
news media you are, shall we say, 
enshrined as a homocidal geno- 
cidal maniac! 

“No! You have twisted it!” Dr. 
West shouted. “My intent — ” His 
voice trailed off, and he felt 
Mao Ill’s stream of destructive 
thoughts backing him into a cor- 
ner so that Mao III could escape. 

T apeworm, your insane attempt 
to seize my power. Paranoid, ad- 



mit you are a god who will cure 
the chaos of the world. You are 
trembling. Little man, you can't 
even remember what you were 
instructed to do. The little im- 
perialist schemers of the C.I.A. 
have concealed what has happen- 
ed during the last fifteen years 
from you. Why else would they 
select you, who have been inert 
in a Canadian cold room for fif- 
teen years, for this mission? Be- 
cause you don’t know! 

Tapeworm, you are their last 
weapon for mass murder and not 
only of Esks! Mao III closed his 
eyes. You have forgotten your 
orders because they are so hor- 
rible you cannot allow yourself. 
Once you were a good man. There 
still is humanity in us both. At 
least, we are both of the human 
race. Yes, we are on the same 
side with all of enlightened hu- 
manity. We are both human. You 
can rise and walk from this vault 
into freedom. No one will harm 
you. You are freed of all murder. 
In China there is no murder, and 
I declare you free of all guilt. 
You are cleansed of blood stains 
of C.I.A. control. Good-by, my 
friend, you are free to walk to the 
elevator and rise into the sun- 
shine. 

“You sly so and so!” Dr. West 
rose, his muscles tightening, his 
head aching with concentration, 
toppling Mao III to the floor, 
where he lay jerking in agony. 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE

“Don’t try to attack me again.” 
Dr. West swayed in the echoes of 
Mao Ill's smothering agony as 
he writhed on the floor. 

“When I am ready,” Dr. West 
gasped, “you — I will examine 
other Esks until we . .” 

Murderer! Even from the floor 
Mao III thrust his javelin 
thoughts. You hope you find evi- 
dence of nonhuman origin and 
that it will excuse your crimes. 
Maniac! You think you warn the 
world and now people listen? Fif- 
teen years ago your lies that Esks 
are not human were disproved. 
Mutants ARE human! You mur- 
derer. You biased expert, the joke 
is on you. I know more of the 
origin of the Esks than you. 

IV 

I n his memory, Dr. West saw 
the bare rock ledges where the 
Boothia Peninsula thrust against 
the frozen sea. Shivering, he’d 
paced the distance across the 
Burned Place. He had taken 16 
strides across the shallow black- 
ened scar on the rock. “If it was 
an airplane, or space garbage, it 
crashed straight in.” He had 
searched for wreckage. 

“Where is the metal?” he had 
asked Peterluk. “The iron. Did 
you Innuit take away the iron?” 
“Eh?" Peterluk’s weathered 
face had creased in a cautious 
smile. “Only two of us then. This 



person — ” the Eskimo had touch- 
his own chest, “ — and this per- 
son’s useless old woman.” 

Dr. West already had seen Eev- 
vaalik. “So the crash was several 
years ago, before these younger 
Eskimos came here, if just you 
and Eevvaalik were here. What 
did you do with all that metal?” 

Peterluk opened his filthy, 
frost-scarred hands. He seemed 
embarrassed because he did not 
want to contradict the white man. 
“Eh? No iron.” 

“Then what fell, what made 
this Burned Place?” Dr. West 
could not even see any evidence 
of a stony meteorite. 

Silence. 

Peterluk stared out at the froz- 
en sea as if hoping to locate a 
seal. “Eh! Ugruk out there!” He 
was trying to change the subject. 

“Something fell from the sky,” 
Dr. West persisted. “Eevvaalik 
said you saw a star fall from the 
sky.” 

Peterluk’s bushy head turned. 
His thick knuckles tightened on 
the stock of his Russian military 
rifle. Any rifle was illegal in this 
Eskimo Cultural Sanctuary. “My 
woman’s teeth worn down. Too 
long ago. She don’t remember 
nothing the way it was.” He slap- 
ped his chest. “This person don’t 
see nothing because asleep. Noth- 
ing fell.” 

“She said you saw it fall from 
the sky. She said you left her and 



100 



GALAXY 



travelled to find out what fell. 
What made this Burned Place?” 
Scowling, Peterluk stared down 
at his mukluks. “Bad candles. 
Many in wooden box.” 

“No. I know this Burned Place 
wasn’t made by sticks of dyna- 
mite.” 

“Kabloona s with iron hats,” 
Peterluk muttered. “Many fine 
presents.” 

“No. This Burned Place could 
not have been made by the radar 
construction workers. Don’t lie.” 
“Egg of God fell here.” Peter- 
luk shrugged and pointed his 
stubby nose at the sea. “Another 
time, ship poke up through ice 
like narwhal. But you no believe 
that either.” 

Peterluk retracted his arm 
within his voluminous sleeve. In- 
side his mangy parka he irritably 
scratched his bare armpit while 
he squinted toward a younger 
man approaching them. “Lice 
never bite him.” 

Peterluk was glaring toward 
the smiling young man approach- 
ing, “Not good hunter!” Peterluk 
commented as if destructive 
words could erase him. 

In appearance, Edwardluk 
could have been Peterluk’s own 
son. Closer, his face seemed 
smooth as a baby’s as if he had 
spent few years outdoors. 

Edwardluk had such a pleasing 
smile that Dr. West instinctively 
felt safer with him than with 



Peterluk. This was a correct 
judgment, even though in those 
days Dr. West had not yet dis- 
tinguished between Eskimo and 
Esk. 

It was to take Dr. West a 
month to understand that Peter- 
luk and his woman were the only 
two Eskimos in the camp of near- 
ly a hundred. 

XTes, Esks, you had to count the 
days of a pregnancy before 
you even realized they were dif- 
ferent, Mao II’s thoughts taunt- 
ed, and you arrived twenty years 
too late to understand the Burned 
Place. Mao III laughed from the 
floor where he lay like a sack. “It 
is amusing that even now, after 
another twenty years, you still 
don’t understand what you saw. 
It is not that Maoism has so 
many more well trained believ- 
ers throughout the world than the 
C.I.A. It is simply that Chinese 
travelers collect even the most 
useless data, rumors, photographs. 
Everything is noted, filed and 
cross-filed. And we have more 
highly placed spies in Russia, col- 
lecting observations. From infin- 
ite unrelated data, the computer 
arranges valid and reliable pat- 
terns.” 

Dr. West permitted — mentally 
helped — Mao III to rise to his 
chair in front of the console. Mao 
III was leading him on for some 
reason. 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 



101 



“It is odd,” Mao III laughed, 
“that I am the only head of state 
who has taken the trouble to 
learn how to question an Informa- 
tion Retrieval Computer directly. 
Surely direct access to infinite 
global date, multireferenced and 
computer-rated for reliability, 
should be more useful to a head 
of state than the filtered informa- 
tion which is sprinkled on the 
head of your president by his 
cabinet officers and presidential 
staff and C.I.A. advisers and 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, none of 
whom agree.” 

Mao Ill’s fingers riffled over 
the index buttons. A still photo- 
graph of a rock ledge appeared 
on the telescreen. Separately pro- 
jected across the top of the pho- 
tograph was a date and some 
symbols. Separately projected be- 
side it appeared a row of index 
numbers presumably guides to 
related data. “Do you recognize 
this photograph?” 

“I assume it is the Burned 
Place but — ” Dr. West stared un- 
certainly. “There is rarely that 
much snow. The High Arctic is 
dry. The wind sweeps . 

“It is not the Burned Place. It 
simply happens to be the nearest 
photograph to what was the loca- 
tion of the North Magnetic Pole 
50 years ago.” Mao Ill’s fingers 
signalled the projected index 
numbers to the console. “The skill 
is in selecting the most pertinent 



general number — subjects. Eski- 
mos. Scientific searches. Perhaps 
meteorites. Aircraft crashes. Sat- 
ellites which have fallen. I repeat 
the location designation: North 
Magnetic Pole, Boothia Penin- 
sula, not too specific. In the com- 
puter, an immense pattern of re- 
lated information has material- 
ized. A leader’s whole life would 
be wasted reading it. To place an 
electronic pin-point in this vast 
matrix, I introduce the phonetic 
number-name Peterluk.” 

A /fao Ill’s fingers moved, and 
-*■*-*- the photograph of a cauti- 
ously smiling young Eskimo hold- 
ing out a white fox fur, appear- 
ed, new index numbers material- 
izing above his head. 

Dr. West blinked. “That 
doesn’t look like — It must have 
been taken when he was a young 
man. What’s that behind him?” 

Mao III depressed one finger, 
and a photograph of what evi- 
dently was an official report ap- 
peared, printed in Russian char- 
acters. 

“For translations from the lan- 
guage of imbeciles,” Mao III said, 
“the vocoder is slowest, but will 
allow us to study the photo- 
graphs. This inefficient vocoder 
should stammer a synopsis of 
those items which are pertinent 
to Peterluk and to my question 
pattern, which still is too diffuse.” 

His finger moved, and the 



102 



GALAXY 



mechanical voice of the vocoder 
howled: “CANADIAN ESKIMO 
SELF-DESIGNATED PETER- 
LUK. CANADA. NORTHWEST 
TERRITORIES. BOOTHIA 
PENINSULA. ESKIMO CUL- 
TURAL SANCTUARY EX- 
TENDING NORTH FROM . 

Mao Ill’s finger pressed: 
“Spare us these bureaucratic de- 
tails.” A blur of documents and 
index numbers swept across the 
screen. “Unfortunately, this com- 
puter is not capable of a direct 
answer to your amorphous ques- 
tion as to what caused the Esks. 
This Information Retrieval Sys- 
tem simply flickers through mo- 
lecular patterns of data, abstract- 
ing. My prod here and poke there 
narrows its tentative synopsis un- 
til the edge of a pattern small 
enough for a human mind to 
grasp is offered to me to guide.” 
A still photograph of a primi- 
tive nuclear submarine appeared 
on the screen. The vocoder howl- 
ed: “POLAR RESEARCH SUB- 
MARINE KOLOGRIVQV. RE- 
VISED MISSION. UNDE- 
TECTED INVESTIGATION 
OF TERMINUS METEORIC 
OR MANMADE ATMO- 
SPHERIC STREAK.” 

Mao III pressed the button cor- 
responding to the first index num- 
ber, and a jerky movie film ap- 
peared on the screen. Bundled 
men were clambering from the 
deck of the submarine into a rub- 



ber boat. Another Russian-made 
film clip, evidently photographed 
from the conning tower by the 
same hand-held camera, showed 
the rubber boat bunting among 
the ice cakes. The distant men 
scrambled on to the rocks and 
upward. 

Dr. West finally recognized the 
promontory. “The Burned Place.” 

Ur T.S. HAD NOT SENT AIR- 
U CRAFT TO INVESTI- 
GATE PSEUDOMETEORIC- 
TYPE FLASH. THEREFORE 
RUSSIANS IN STATE OF 
READINESS FOR U. S. MILI- 
TARY TRAP ON CANADIAN 
SOIL,” the vocoder howled, and 
Mao III nodded. “This is as close 
as the computer approaches rea- 
soning as it abstracts the perti- 
nent essentials from a hundred 
documents and offers us its syn- 
opsis with the best internal re- 
liability.” 

Film from a hand-held camera 
was showing bundled Russians 
walking gingerly among large 
broken objects and nervously 
glancing at the sky as if expecting 
the contrails of U.S.A.F. ramjets. 

Rising from his chair, Dr. West 
shouted: “Close up! Is there film 
showing a close-up of what in 
hell those things are?” 

As if anticipating Mao Ill’s 
finger, the computer projected a 
close-up of a Russian hammering 
with his rifle butt at a huge, dark 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 



103 



curve. It looked like ceramic clay. 
The rifle butt failed to chip it. 
The camera shifted to another 
broken curve. The two might fit 
together. Dr. West thought. The 
outside of each curve was rough- 
ened, darkened as if charred. The 
inside of the curves gleamed 
white. A broken edge was thicker 
than a Russian’s hand width. 
Like a gigantic mo Husk’s shell, 
Dr. West thought as a Russian 
walked upright under the jagged 
upper end of the curve and turn- 
ed and grinned bashfully at the 
cameraman. 

“RUSSIANS UNABLE TO 
IDENTIFY BROKEN OB- 
JECTS,” the vocoder howled. 
“PLANNED TO REMOVE FOR 
FURTHER TESTS.” 

“Good,” said Mao Ill’s voice, 
“the computer has narrowed the 
available data and is attempting 
chronological order.” 

The Russian film-maker must 
have whirled with his camera. On 
the screen there was a glimpse of 
Russians scattering, a rifle was 
raised, and then the camera 
steadied at a stocky figure clam- 
bering down over the ledges. 

A closer view showed the 
young Eskimo holding out a 
white fox fur and grinning ex- 
pectantly as if he imagined all 
whitemen who illegally entered 
the Eskimo Cultural Sanctuary 
came to trade. Dr. West blinked. 
“I’ll be damned. It is Peterluk as 



a young man. Look at him grin- 
ning at that Russian’s rifle. He 
wants it so bad he can taste it!” 

“ESKIMO ADMITTED OB- 
SERVATION OF METEOR 
FLASH,” the vocoder howled. 
“UNABLE TO ESTIMATE 
DATE. CLAIMED HE TOOK 
NOTHING FROM BURNED 
SITE. AFTER REPEATED 
QUESTIONING ADMITTED 
HE HAD BROKEN A SMALL- 
ER SHELL.” 

The film showed a Russian 
lifting a white curve perhaps only 
an inch thick and large enough 
to shade the Russian’s head and 
shoulders like a huge eggshell. 

“FROM ITS POSITION IN 
WRECKAGE, RUSSIANS CON- 
CLUDED SMALLER SHELL 
WAS INNER SHELL. QUES- 
TIONED ESKIMO AS TO 
SHELL’S CONTENTS. ESKI- 
MO DENIED HAD BROKEN 
INNER SHELL.” 

The film showed a Russian 
carrying a curve of the inner shell 
toward the water. 

A long shot showed four Rus- 
sians dragging a fragment of the 
larger outer shell into the rubber 
boat. “ELEVEN TRIPS TO 
FERRY ALL SHELLS TO

The film showed two towering 
Russians smiling, their friendly 
arms draped over Peterluk’s 
shoulders. Between them the Es- 
kimo stood like a worried dwarf, 
his white fox fur hanging limply 
from one hand. 

“INVITED ESKIMO TO VIS- 
IT SUBMARINE,” the vocoder 
howled its chronological synopsis 
from what must have been Rus- 
sian naval reports. “ESKIMO 
STATED HAPPY TO VISIT

GESTED BEFORE GOING

The screen went blank. Evi- 
dently the cameraman knew what 
not to film.

howled. “HIGH CONTRAIL OF

“Replay that part about the

“Signal for more information

Mao III was pressing index 
numbers which had been project- 
ed during this quotation from the 
naval report, and the vocoder 
howled inane statistics about the 
Boothia Peninsula and the per- 
iods of the Moon. Mao III shrug- 
ged. “Evidently there is no addi- 
tional information filed in the 
category: Quick Babies, Boothia 
Peninsula.” 

A still photograph showed men 
in white coats standing proudly 
in front of a darkly oval patch- 
work reconstruction. Seen as a 
whole, the outer shell had less 
resemblance to a huge mollusk’s 
shell. Darkly charred, it loomed 
ominously behind the white-coat- 
ed men.

“Impossible to keep a secret in

“especially fifty years ago when 
that object fell, when Maoism 
was the wave of the future, and 
friends of China, old Stalinists, 
still were concealed everywhere. 
As you saw, even the motion pic- 
ture films, which the Inner Polit-

copied by surviving Stalinist- 
Maoists. With so much corrup- 
tion in Russia, I suspect your

pies. But those who sent you here 
would not confide in you, my 
tapeworm.”

/ V'l the screen, microphoto- 
graphs showed the molecular 
structure of the inner shell. 
“CARBON - OXYGEN - CAL-

long scientific report. “MICRO-

STANCE INNER SHELL. POS-

TIFIABLE DISARRANGED

EVIDENCE OF CAUSE-DIS- 
APPEARANCE OF THEORET- 
ICAL LIFE-FORM IN SHELL.” 
“I am more free than my com- 
puter to theorize,” Mao III laugh- 
ed. “That barbarian Eskimo, 
when he poked whatever was 
mashed within that inner shell, 
he sucked his finger; then hun- 
grily smiling, he would eat it 
without a bellyache. I hope it was 
only the remains of an American 
monkey or chimpanzee.” 

“INNER POLITBURO DE- 
CISION BY VOTE OF 4 TO 1,” 
the vocoder howled, “ORIGIN

TIVE U.S. STRATEGIC HOAX, 
VOTE 3 TO 2. POLITICAL

VOTE 5 TO 0. PROVOCA- 
TEUR SHELL TO BE DE- 
STROYED AT ONCE AND NO 
FURTHER COGNIZANCE.” 



“Even so, a beautiful hoax,” 
Mao III laughed. “For once you 
American bunglers nearly were 
able to keep a secret from the 
Russians — ; and even from us. In 
the years since then, our friends 
of China at Cape Kennedy and 
at Vandenburg never were able 
to collect reliable information as 
to just how the hoax was secretly 
constructed, launched and delib- 
erately crashed. In fact, we never 
have found the evidence of U.S. 
origin. Do not look so discontent- 
ed because the C.I.A. did not in- 
form you. After all, this C.I.A. 
hoax was perpetuated SO years 
ago, in the 1960’s.” 

Mao Ill’s voice was smooth as 
poisoned honey. “Even now, you 
would not be informed of its se- 
cret, historical malfunction be- 
cause you were to be parachuted 
in China where the C.I.A. still 
thinks we are retarded angry chil- 
dren who know nothing. But I 
assure you that such a hoax never 
could have been consummated, 
even in those days, upon alert 
Maoist scientists.” 

Dr. West said nothing. 

“You are wishful thinking it 
was not a hoax,” Mao III taunt- 
ed, “because your life, your be- 
liefs tremble on a pinpoint hope 
that something which fell upon 
the Boothia Peninsula will con- 
firm your monomaniac insistence 
that Esks are not human. Mur- 
derer, you would lunge any- 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 



107 



where for evidence of nonhuman 
origin to justify your hatred of 
the Esks. You would embrace any 
obvious U. S. hoax. Always you 
would clutch false evidence that 
Esk origin is from the sky be- 
cause that is what you need to 
believe, that Esks are nonhuman. 
Otherwise you would be forced 
to see yourself as the rest of 
the world sees you, you convict- 
ed mass murderer. See yourself 
as you are, monomaniac murder- 
er, leave me, tapeworm. Go! 
Leave this vault.” 

Dr. West gasped. “You can’t 
wear me down with talk. You 
can’t drive me insane. I won’t 
have a heart attack because of 
you. If your spies in America 
could find no evidence of con- 
struction and launch in America 
of a nonmetallic object of large 
size, I know damn well it wasn’t 
built in America. It was no hoax 
built on this Earth. And I’ll tell 
you this. The crash wasn’t in- 
vestigated by an American search 
party because sophisticated radar 
would have told the Air Force 
it was not a metallic object. It 
would have echoed radar pulses 
as if made of stone. Maybe the 
Russian radar of that period was 
not able to discriminate, and 
they thought a satellite had fall- 
en. They sent the sub. Undoubt- 
edly U. S. forces had crossed it 
off as only a stony meteorite.” 
“Tapeworm, don’t you won- 



der why the fall-streak of such 
a large meteorite did not at- 
tract an American scientific ex- 
pedition?” 

“I — that was fifty years ago, 
in the 1960’s. I.” Even in his 
heart-pounding anger Dr. West 
realized from Mao Ill’s quick 
thoughts that the orange flash- 
ing light on the telescreen indi- 
cated a high priority telesatellite 
transmission.

symbolic dove of peace, 
then a film clip of a peaceful 
wheat field dimpling in the 
breeze, and a peaceful baby 
smiling in living color, its arms 
outstretched to the world, then 
the American flag gently wav- 
ing, while the audio played: “Oh, 
beautiful, for spacious skies ...” 
All this was an introductory film 
clip, a station break via hundreds 
of U.S. Information Agency sat- 
ellites sprinkled throughout the 
heavens. Shielded from the jam- 
ming of rival foreign teleinforma- 
tion services, the U.S. telesatel- 
lites were relaying on all 82 chan- 
nels down to every square foot 
of the Earth.

slightly oriental around the eyes 
so that he could be recognized 
as almost any nationality. 

Smiling into the teleprompter, 
the friendly man was speaking; 
and tire telesatellites over China 
relayed a peaceful-voiced Chin- 
ese translation: “Friends, I bring

from your television set. Please 
call in your children to listen. 
This important announcement 
also concerns them. The Presi- 
dent of the United States has 
asked me to tell you how happy 
he is that the Chairman of the 
Chinese Federation of Nations 
has suggested a friendly telecon- 
ference.” 

The Secretary of State smiled 
through his transparent tele- 
prompter and took a deep 
breath. “The President of the 
United States asked me to tell 
you he feels honored that the 
Chairman of the Chinese Feder- 
ation of Nations has invited him 
to a split-screen teleconference. 
Don’t go away from your tele- 
vision sets. This historic meet- 
ing, which promises greater hap- 
piness for all peoples throughout 



the world, will be broadcast at 
this very some time tomorrow. 
You, your children, all ages will 
want to witness this historic 
meeting. Be sure to tune in.” 

Jagged static squealed off the 
sound and momentarily distorted 
the smiling face of the Secretary 
of State as he was dissolved into 
majestic redwood trees. The 
American flag billowed in the 
sunset as Mao III switched off 
the broadcast, and the picture 
contracted to a little bright spot 
which vanished. 

“Tomorrow.” Dr. West felt 
hollow and unprepared; there 
had been no mention of the 
agenda. Were the subjects for dis- 
cussion still being negotiated in 
Warsaw? 

“Now the military will be 
forced to face the fact that I 
am — insane. Insane to have sug- 
gested such a meeting,” Mao III 
blurted. “The military will dis- 
connect my external broadcast 
antenna. It is undefended on top 
of the Winter Palace. They will 
not be sufficient fools to let me 
match myself against your robust 
President. Perhaps one of my un- 
derstudies — No, the generals 
are too cautious even for that. 
They will deny there was an 
agreement for a teleconference. 
China’s prestige must be pre- 
served. They will denounce your 
Secretary of State as a hoaxer. 
Then they will come down the

elevator shaft and — rescue me 
— kill us both!” 

T'vr. West glanced at the guard 
lights on the console. Evi- 
dently the elevator shaft still 
was safely locked at the surface. 
If the console could be believed, 
the protective devices still were 
cocked. 

“It is a U.S. hoax!” Mao III 
blustered. “Your Secretary of 
State was afraid to mention that 
population limitation would be 
on the agenda. It won’t be. Your 
government already has gained 
a propaganda advantage. Now 
the C.I.A. will create an incident. 
Perhaps an American ship will 
sink, and this will be blamed 
on one of our submarines on sta- 
tion off your coast. Your gov- 
ernment will use the television 
time tomorrow for a taped de- 
nunciation. Your President will 
not face me. How can he, when 
the agenda we sent to Warsaw 
requires a discussion of the In- 
ternational Esk Problem. Your 
government fears I am going to 
suggest bilateral population lim- 
itation and quotas and inter- 
national inspections of our re- 
spective populations of Esks.” 

Mao III ended triumphantly: 
"Any suggestion that the in- 
creasing number of American 
Esks should be limited would 
cause a political uproar in the 
United States. Any suggestion 



that their number should be re- 
duced would cause revolution!” 
“You’re unfamiliar with the 
United States way of life,” Dr. 
West replied. 

“No. You are. Admit that you 
haven’t seen the United States 
for fifteen years.” 

“I know more about it than 
you.” Dr. West visualized the 
basement rooms of C.I.A. head- 
quarters and then the dark air- 
port, the wave-ridges of Cali- 
fornia mountains, the spreading 
away of the coastline as the ram- 
jet streaked out over the Pacific 
Ocean to “dump” him on China. 

“Since you were awakened, you 
have seen more of China than 
the U.S.” Mao III retorted. 
“You have seen the necessity of 
the Esks in expanding Chinese 
agriculture. How else can we sup- 
port expanding consumer pro- 
duction and expanding defensive 
military. At this moment my gen- 
erals must be plotting to attack 
me. Now they think I will agree 
to limit the number of Chinese 
Esks.” 

“But China has at least a bil- 
lion Esks now.” Dr. West retort- 
ed. “A population growth rate 
like that can’t continue.” 

“China is a large country with 
much barren land which can yield 
surplus only when farmed by 
very low intake units.” 

“But next year there will be 
two billion Esks,” Dr. West 



110 



GALAXY 



shouted in frustration. “You have 
only so many mountains for them 
to terrace. Then diminishing re- 
turns and Malthus. If the Esks 
keep increasing in the mountains, 
if the Chinese keep multiplying 
in the cities, starvation will over- 
take . 

“For a scientifically minded 
Maoist economy there cannot be 
too many Chinese,” Mao III re- 
torted. “There cannot even be too 
many Esks while there is so much 
empty space in the world. When 
I conceived the masterstroke of 
rescuing those first hundred un- 
derprivileged Esks from the star- 
vation in Canada, I foresaw all 
possible developments and have 
made all necessary preparations.” 

“You were insanely stupid even 
then, fifteen years ago.” 

“Yes, I am so stupid, I sus- 
pected that the United States 
would react,” Mao III laughed, 
“and breed its own Esks. Esks 
have agreeable uses when spread 
throughout the American popu- 
lation, but not in China! Except 
for a few special needs such as 
my own Esks servants, I have 
kept our Esks in their own sep- 
arate communes segregated from 
the Chinese population. This is a 
preventitive for a phenomenon. 
Yes, I foresaw the eventual an- 
archic collapse in Canada.” 

“Dammit, let me see the Unit- 
ed States!” 

“Canada is a more advanced 



example of my foresight.” Mao 
Ill’s hand moved on the console. 
“These are the only film clips of 
Canada so you need not believe 
them.” 

No! Dr. West thought forcibly. 
First show me the United States. 

And Mao Ill’s skeletal fingers 
obeyed. 

A cross the screen jiggled an 
electric fuel-cell powered bus 
as if filmed by a tourist. The 
neon advertising below its win- 
dow blinked: FINE FUNERALS 
FOR HUMANS OR ESKS; then 
ASTROBOY CONVENIENT 
MINIMUM EXCRETABLE 
BREAD. The bus turned toward 
the camera. Its destination tape 
read: WILSHIRE TO WEST- 
WOOD. The film with an ama- 
teurish zoom enlarged the bus 
driver’s calmly smiling face. 

“You see,” Mao III said trium- 
phantly, “the bus driver is an 
American Esk.” 

“FILMED MINUS SIX 
MONTHS,” the vocoder of the 
information Retrieval Computer 
howled, “BY STUDENT-VISI- 
TOR LOS ANGELES.” 

Mao Ill’s finger shifted on the 
console, and Dr. West stared at a 
film of a huge white truck enter- 
ing a suburban driveway of a 
high-rise apartment. As it stop- 
ped, a great white scoop-jaw 
above the cab of the truck reach- 
ed forward and downward like a 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 



111 



dragonfly larva’s jaw. From the 
cab of the truck, a hurrying man 
in white emerged, seized a gar- 
bage can and emptied it into the 
jaw. The camera zoomed at the 
man’s happily smiling face, an 
Esk. 

Click, on the screen appeared 
towering condiminimum apart- 
ments beside the East River near 
the ancient United Nations build- 
ing, and this more expertly 
handled camera explored past the 
Esk doorman into the ground 
floor lobby of the apartment 
building where a short-legged, 
but attractively uniformed and 
smiling maid was walking toward 
the escalator. 

“Another Esk.” Mao III rest- 
lessly pressed a button, and an 
unsteady film showed a large, 
concrete-block house. “SIOUX 
FALLS,” the vocoder howled as 
the lens-view zoomed into the 
screened window. An American 
Negro family were sitting down 
to supper, and a neatly uniform- 
ed Esk maid appeared from the 
kitchen carrying a steaming plat- 
ter of franks and sauerkraut. “An 
Esk,” Mao III chortled. “I am so 
familiar with imperialist oppres- 
sor history. What a satisfactory 
capitalistic solution! Esks are 
happy to be at the bottom of the 
American peck order.” 

Click, a dozen small Esk boys 
were shown industriously polish- 
ing an autocopter, while an 



American boy and girl played on 
a revolvo-swing and their father 
lay on a lawn dais officiously 
gesticulating to an obedient Esk 
who was laden with a lawn rake, 
a fertilo injector and a dandelion 
extractor. 

Click, along a college dormi- 
tory hall a svelte-hipped Esk 
maid balanced a tray of martini- 
shaped glasses through a Stan- 
ford-bannered door chalked 
FRESHMAN STUD-Y RUM, 
and she didn’t come out. 

Click, the sign on a huge new 
windowless warehouse read : ESK 
RESCUE MISSION #9! Chica- 
go Aid-to-the-Esks Society. And 
underneath, Healthy Canadian 
Imports. Also Fresh Raised Lo- 
cal Stock. At the bottom a price- 
list was taped to the door: AIR 
EXPORT TO SOUTH AMERI- 
CA AND EUROPE. Wholesale 
Prices on Request. 

“Damn!” Dr. West was sweat- 
ing and laughing and shivering at 
the same time, horrified. “God! 
In a few years when there’s no 
more countries to which this sur- 
plus can be exported — ” 

“You are supposed to be the 
birth-control expert,” Mao III re- 
plied maliciously. “A scientific 
humane solution such as forcible 
birth-control injections should be 
simple, if capitalist and revision- 
ist oppressors are able to cooper- 
ate and behave rationally. But 
there is an unknown factor. Even

GALAXY 



rational Maoist scientists cannot 
explain it. In the first country to 
have a preponderantly Esk popu- 
lation, which was Canada . 

/^flick, across the screen moved 
an impenetrable barbed -wire 
fence stretching along the Sas- 
katchewan prairie. Filmed from 
the U.S. side of the border, the 
fence bulged with dark clots, 
bodies in the barbed wire, on the 
Canadian side. Further behind 
the International Boundary, in- 
distinguishable masses of Esks 
(?) stood waiting. 

“MINUS FOUR DAYS,” the 
vocoder howled .“U.S. TROOPS 
IN FOREGROUND REPORT- 
EDLY GUARDING FENCE 
AGAINST RENEWED CUT- 
TING ACTIVITY. BEARDED 
HUMAN PRISONER RE- 
PORTEDLY MEMBER NEW 
YORK SAVE-THE-ESKIMQS 
LEAGUE.” 

A close-up through the boun- 
dary fence showed skeletons, hu- 
mans or Esks? Starvation or? 

“I can’t stand to look at this. 
Let me look at Ottawa,” Dr. 
West blurted, “where I was im- 
prisoned.” 

Click, instead of the angry mob 
of Canadians who had reviled 
him fifteen years ago, the streets 
of Ottawa now were stagnant 
with starving Esks, even wander- 
ing in the middle of the street. 
Photographed from a copter, the 



first film clip failed to show a 
single moving vehicle on the 
streets od downtown Ottawa. 
“MINUS SIX MONTHS,” the 
vocoder howled. NOW RE- 
PORTEDLY CITY POPULA- 
TION REDUCED. LACK OF 
TRANSPORT AND FOOD.” 
“But what happened to the 
Canadians?” Dr. West bleated. 

Tall white towers like grain 
elevators appeared against the 
skyline of the city. “That’s it, the 
New Ottawa Reformation Cen- 
ter,” Dr. West said, remembering 
his loneliness for Nona. What’s 
happened to her? Are there close- 
ups of any guards on file?” 
Click, Esks were wandering in 
and out as if the towers had be- 
come giant dormitories. “What 
happened to the real people? I 
knew some of the guards, when I 
was a prisoner — ” 

Click, Mao Ill’s hands moved 
at the console, and the comput- 
er howled: “INSUFFICIENT

ONER DR. JOSEPH WEST

ed to the next item. “FOR DATA

moved. 85234 PETERLUK

MINUS 16 YEARS SELF- 
HANGING.”

"So Feterluk was dead before I 
even entered the Reformation 
Center, and they wouldn’t tell 
me,” Dr. West muttered. “Dead, 
and he was the father — perhaps 
the foster-father of all Esks. His 
own lying statements must have 
contained evidence of their ori- 
gin. Dammit, they’re not hu- 
man!” 

A/T ao HI laughed contempt- 
uously. “Many in the Unit- 
ed States agree with you on that. 
To relegate Esks to subhumanity 
justifies buying and selling.” Mao 
Ill’s voice softened. “The unan- 
swered question to me is why the 
Canadians finally in self-defense 
did not massacre enough of their 
Esks. Because there was some 
confusion due to interbreeding as 
to who was an Esk is no explana- 
tion. Human beings have been 
willingly massacring each other 
since the beginning of our spe- 
cies. But so inefficiently in Can- 
ada — ” 

Click, a jiggling film of men 
with axes and shotguns showed 
Esks being herded like rabbits 
against a fence corner, the axes 
rising and falling. “LYNCH 
MOB, BRITISH COLUMBIA,” 
the vocoder howled. “MINUS 
TEN YEARS.” A close-up show- 
ed a Canadian farmer retching 
and staggering away. 

“It should have been so easy to 
exterminate them when there 



were only a few million,” Mao 
III mused. “Nowhere have Esks 
put up violent resistance. When 
the first rumors of the failure of 
Canadian rioters to accomplish 
anything substantial reached me, 
I ordered my 8th Route Army 
here in Peking to carry out an 
experimental massacre of one 
small commune of Esks who live 
on the dust desert west of Peking. 
By using machine guns, the num- 
ber of Esks had been reduced 
about 10% when it began to rain. 
The commanding general also 
had other excuses. Machine guns 
overheated and jammed. After I 
removed him and ordered the 
massacre completed, the new 
commander, my former aide, 
General Chen Yung, had difficul- 
ty with trucks bringing replace- 
ment troops to the scene. Finally 
an air attack with napalm was 
successfully carried out, and I be- 
lieve a good portion of those Esks 
were eliminated, although now 
there seem to be more out there 
in the desert than ever. To super- 
stitious troops the unexpected 
difficulties of execution were dis- 
turbing.” 

“Damn right they are disturb- 
ing!” Dr. West yelled. “Here you 
are letting Esks increase to a bil- 
lion in China, and you don’t even 
know if you’re capable of elimi- 
nating them.” 

“It could be done, it could be. 
Mass executions become simple 



114 



GALAXY 



matters when competently organ- 
ized,” Mao III replied. ‘‘With 
historically scientific logic, Mao- 
ism can solve any problem of 
mankind.” 

“Then do it, dammit. Now!” 
“Tapeworm, you forget that 
you are in command, not I.” 

Dr. West closed his eyes. What 
did those jerks in the C.I.A. in- 
struct me to do? 

“Nothing that our interrogation 
could locate,” Mao III taunted. 
“Squirm, tapeworm, squirm with 
all the problems of the world that 
wiser men than you have made 
more complicated during each 
generation until — ” 

“Shut up!” Dr. West visualized 
U.S. ramjets spraying China with 
gynecological bacteria which 
would infect Esks and, of course, 
would have an even more viru- 
lent effect upon Chinese; that 
still was one unsolved problem. 

Could the retaliatory Chinese 
counter-strike against America be 
disorganized from within? Dam- 
mit, I can’t have been sent here 
for that.” 

“Your aggressor-indoctrinated 
thoughts are of the type which 
continually disturb my military,” 
Mao III sighed. “As long as the 
Asian Continent must defend it- 
self from imperialist invaders, our 
larger population is our main de- 
fensive weapon. My military will 
never agree to a unilateral mas- 
sacre of our Esk population while 



an uninspected Esk population 
continues to increase in the Unit- 
ed States.” 

Mao Ill’s voice rose. “The 
United States is using its own ir- 
responsibly increasing Esk popu- 
lation as an aggressive threat to 
world peace. If the United States 
should outnumber China, and 
this could happen because your 
Esks are multiplying so rapidly, 
then five thousand years of Chi- 
nese cultural heritage would be 
threatened. Tapeworm, can’t you 
understand that my military can- 
not agree to any limitation of our 
Esks while — ” 

“Shut up!” Dr. West’s face con- 
tracted, concentrating all his frus- 
trated anger against Mao III, and 
the paralyzed man toppled to the 
floor with a brain-blinding thud. 
Blackness! 

Dr. West clawed at his own 
eyes, momentarily unable to see. 
His vision glimmering, he crawled 
to Mao III and shook him, then 
grasped for his faint pulse. 

As he sat there wondering if 
Mao III would regain con- 
sciousness, Dr. West remembered 
the smug faces, the excited faces 
in the Harvard Circle of the 
C.I.A. You smart operators, he 
thought, right now you must be 
thinking you’ve almost scored 
your biggest one. You’ve planted 
a monomaniac named Dr. West 
in Peking. You’ve used me to set 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 



115 



up a teleconfrontation with Mao 
III. 

The Secretary of State had re- 
acted so quickly. The ready re- 
sponse tlirough Warsaw must 
have been prepared even before 
you parachuted me, Dr. West 
thought 

But even if the teleconfronta- 
tion takes place and the Presi- 
dent verbally destroys Mao III, 
you’ll be falling into a new box 
of problems with the Chinese mil- 
itary. And the Esks still will be 
increasing — including increasing 
millions of Esks in the United 
States. 

Dr. West blinked, and then his 
eyebrows rose. What if you C.I.A . 
geniuses are two steps ahead of 
me? Could it be the President will 
support Mao III? That way the 
Harvard Circle may hope popu- 
lation control of the Esks in Chi- 
na will begin. After all, Mao III 
is supposed to be controlled by 
me, Dr. West, monomaniac hater 
of the Esks. If China limits its 
Esk population, then public opin- 
ion in the U.S. may permit the 
U.S. government to limit the 
number of Esks belonging to in- 
dividuals and corporations in the 
United States. 

In realization, Dr. West began 
to shake with excitement. “Do 
you hope that I, the population 
expert, hopefully the controller of 
Mao III, will initiate China’s first 
population limitation offer? And 



I did! You hope this will allow 
public opinion in the U.S. to fol- 
low. Are you trying to control the 
Esk population explosion in the 
U.S. that you’re now politically 
unable to do anything about?” 

Dr. West propped up Mao Ill’s 
head and desperately sought his 
pulse. “The teleconference is to- 
morrow!” 

A red light flashed on the tele- 
screen. Dr. West didn’t know 
what to do. Evidently the broad- 
cast was of such high priority it 
contained a code-servo override. 
The screen switched itself on. 

VI 

A cross the television screen, 
gracefully stroking lines of 
ink converged to form a calli- 
graphic dove of peace. 

A dissolve into living color 
showed ranks of red-necker- 
chiefed Chinese children march- 
ing across the Great Square. 
Their red balloons and golden 
balloons bobbed over their 
heads. En masse the balloons 
rose into the blue sky. Dr. 
West recognized this as the stan- 
dard introductory film clip used 
by the New China Information 
Agency in its worldwide telecasts. 
Magically all the golden balloons 
drifted in front of the gigantic 
silver rocket which protruded 
from the pink-walled courtyard 
of the Winter Palace. All the red 



116 



GAIAXY 



balloons drifted over the ancient 
curved marble of the Jade Rain- 
bow Bridge. “China is a bridge of 
peace to all people,” a soft voice 
hummed, and Dr. West knew 
translations were soothing tele- 
viewers in Afghanistan, Algeria, 
America. 

The Chinese Foreign Minister 
bowed to the television audience, 
his hands pressed together in 
a gesture of peace. “Friends 
throughout the world, our revered 
Chairman, our Saving Star, re- 
gretfully will be unable to appear 
in the teleconference which he 
proposed and the President of the 
United States seemed to have ac- 
cepted. It is well that the Chi- 
nese Federation of Nations clings 
to peace in this moment of im- 
perialist aggression. Last night a 
black aircraft of the warmonger- 
ing United States Central Intelli- 
gence Agency made an unprovok- 
ed attack upon Szechuan Pro- 
vince.” 

The Foreign Minister smiled 
humbly at his teleprompter. “Of 
course the imperialist aircraft 
was shot down by our ever-vigil- 
ant civilian defense militia.” Pie 
nodded his head, and a film of 
unidentifiable wreckage strewn 
across mountain rice terraces was 
projected while his peaceful voice 
rose to outrage: “Unfortunately, 
those genocidal murderers of the 
Central Intelligence Agency of 
the United States were able to 



parachute a capsule loaded with 
bacteriological weapons upon 
peaceful Szechuan Province. The 
shock of this treachery has caus- 
ed a relapse in the health of our 
beloved Chairman, and he will be 
unable to appear on television to 
confront the guilty President of 
the warmongering United States!” 

The film showed an oddly fa- 
miliar terraced mountainside. 
Across the stair-step rice paddies 
sprawled a gigantic parachute. 
Dr. West blinked in recognition. 
In the mud lay a standard air- 
crew ejection capsule from a 
U.S. Air Force ramjet bomber. 

“. until such time as the 
United States can show a sincere 
desire for peace,” the Foreign 
Minister’s voice was crooning, 
“the Chinese Federation of Na- 
tions democratically and unani- 
mously believes that an interna- 
tional teleconference would be 
futile.” 

“You fraud,” Dr. West gasped 
aloud at the smug face on the 
telescreen. “That parachute, that 
terraced mountain, that’s my old 
ejection capsule. That film was 
taken over six months ago after 
I — we came down in Szechuan 
Province.” 

Dr. West moaned in frustra- 
tion and banged his fist on the 
floor and shouted at the tele- 
screen. “Liar! Chinese generals 
manufactured this incident to get 
off the hook of a teleconference.” 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 



117 



JBesicie him, Mao Ill’s eyes had 
opened. 

“Did you hear that, you pre- 
maturely senile-brained idiot?” 
Dr. West shouted, his futile rage 
hammering his heart. “Your For- 
eign Minister announced you’ve 
had a relapse. The Generals are 
calling all the shots. You’re fin- 
ished as Chairman. You blob of 
dead flesh, you were nearly use- 
less even when I took control of 
you. Now you’re nothing! I’ve 
ended as nothing. We’re both 
nothing!” 

TV /Tao III writhed on the floor 
from Dr. West’s radiated 
anger, and Dr.' West grabbed his 
wrist, felt for his erratically shiv- 
ering pulse. Mao Ill’s heart was 
fibrillating. Dr. West tried to 
calm himself, and gradually Mao 
Ill’s pulse regained a semblance 
of a rhythm. 

A brilliant stratagem. All are 
loyal to the line of Mao, Mao 
Ill’s erratic thoughts seeped. 
China is Maoism, and I am Mao, 
and all is well. 

Dr. West stared in frightened 
fascination at the Command Mi- 
crophone on the console. He 
couldn’t endure waiting. He had 
to know. Could he — Mao III — 
still broadcast orders from this 
vault? IS THE POWER DEAD? 

“Dead?” Mao Ill’s voice chirp- 
ed with startling cheerfulness. “I 
am nearly dead. But I have pa- 



tience. Help me up, my tape- 
worm. I will die peacefully in my 
bed. No man expects more.” His 
personality seemed altered. “My 
generals will have to wait. I have 
a headache. Perhaps they may 
need me tomorrow.” 

Dr. West dragged him to the 
console and ordered him to con- 
tact any place on the surface, the 
Interrogation Room. Mao III did 
not respond. 

In Dr. West’s arms, Mao III 
was a frail sack of bones, smiling 
blissfully as if unaware of Dr. 
West’s order. 

“Have patience,” Mao III 
sighed. “This is how I control my 
generals, patting one dog, then 
another until they snarl at each 
other in jealousy. I have patience. 
They will fail to negotiate their 
differences. Power is Mao. All 
will be well.” 

Dr. West emptied him onto his 
bed, and Mao Ill’s face sagged in 
a smile like melting wax. All will 
be well. 

Mao Ill’s personality seemed 
so softened that Dr. West sur- 
mised another hair-thin vein 
within his cerebrum painlessly 
had ruptured. Another tiny area 
of his brain tissue was dying. 
Mao III had undergone another 
little stroke. 

“I am Chiu Hsing, the Saving 
Star,” Mao III sighed dreamily. 
“Grandfather Mao and I are his- 
tory. I am the unifying symbol 



118 



GALAXY 



for China, power and love and 
forgiveness. When my generals 
bow down before me, I will ask 
that you be painlessly shot.” 

Dr. West made no comment. 

Mao III closed his eyes. 

While Mao III sank easily into 
tire smiling sleep of the pure-in- 
heart, Dr. West glared at the op- 
pressive ceiling. Sleepless, Dr. 
West writhed. He sat up and 
stared at the Control Console. 

With surprising mnemonic 
power Dr. West remembered from 
watching Mao III the pattern of 
pushbuttons which should open a 
command line to the surface, in 
this cautious instance to the In- 
terrogation Room. On the tele- 
screen the white Interrogation 
Room appeared, empty except for 
the modernistic electronic inter- 
rogation table and an old Chi- 
nese on his knees, scrubbing the 
floor by hand as if he had re- 
mained in the 17th Century. 

/"An the console in front of Dr. 

West glowed the light indi- 
cating the Command Microphone 
was live. It dazzled with power. 
Dr. West whistled into the micro- 
phone. The old man did not look 
up. 

“Summon your superior,” Dr. 
West commanded in impeccable 
Neo-Chinese, and still the old 
man went on scrubbing. “Stand 
to attention or be shot!” Dr. West 
snapped, beginning to sweat with 



anxiety as the old man continued 
wearily sloshing his big hand- 
brush back and forth on the wet 
floor as if he had not heard. 

“Deaf fool!” Dr. West shouted 
in frustration, while the old man 
sloshed his brush in the bucket. 

Dr. West knew he didn’t hear. 
The military already must have 
cut the external broadcast wires. 
Reception still worked when he 
pressed another button on the 
console. For the moment the 
Command Vault still retained its 
exterior television eyes. The tele- 
screen showed Chinese troops 
climbing into armored trucks. 

The military have cut the 
vault’s throat, Dr. West thought. 
Mao Ill’s — my ability to broad- 
cast is finished. No more com- 
mands to the outside. What do I 
do now? 

Numbly sitting, Dr. West felt 
amputated. No more commands 
to the outside, Dr. West felt him- 
self shriveling. My purpose is 
gone. 

“Gone! Got to get out.” He 
could feel the ceiling pressing 
down, 4,000 feet of rock and sub- 
soil and earth crushing him into 
thickening claustrophobia as he 
walked, not ran, to the elevator. 

His face twisting with pain, he 
turned around and ran back to 
his bed and covered his head. 

Even if they don’t shoot me 
when I appear at the surface, I’d 
be powerless. Free on the surface 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE

I’d be nothing. I would see the 
billions of Esks increasing while 
I did nothing, having lost the 
chance for power. 

Dr. West turned over on his 
back. 

I’m lying here in the vault of 
power. The power’s off but my 
hope . He tried to open his 
memory, to search through the 
shambles left by Chinese electro- 
interrogation. 

He visualized the faces of the 
Harvard Circle bending over him 
in the basement of the Central 
Intelligence Agency building. 

Bunglers, each subliminal in- 
struction was to be cued by pre- 
dicted events. But this is a term- 
inal event. Please let an alternate 
plan rise to the surface of my 
memory. Oh God, how I need . 
Have you deserted me? 

As if those distant faces had 
become his gods, Dr. West pray- 
ed for a vision and felt only the 
endless emptiness of the Uni- 
verse. 

What was any purpose? Dr. 
West lay on his back feeling 
waves of Universal time curving 
back to the edge of sleep. 

Suddenly he smiled. Perhaps I 
am all-important. I am the seed 
of life in this buried vault. He 
slept and dreamed he arose with 
power over the world: “The Esks 
are to be sacrificed to me.” He 
was huge and snow white as a 
polar bear. 



\ wakened by the cautious 
movements of an Esk with 
breakfast tray. Dr. West sat up, 
blinking. He got up, wandered 
over like an early morning drunk- 
en bum and stared wonderingly 
at Mao III. 

“When I wake up too soon,” 
Dr. West muttered, “I see these 
Esks as something else.” For 
breakfast he was unusually hun- 
gry. He ate ravenously. 

Mao III did not open his eyes. 
Why your hatred of our gentle 
Esk comrades, they who feed us? 
His dagger-sharp thought incis- 
ed, if you had been born in the 
closeness of a Chinese commune 
you would be an open man in- 
stead of a closed man. 

“I don’t hate them. I have 
never hated them.” Dr. West was 
wide-awake now. “But as they 
increase, crowding me every- 
where, I feel my elbows, my teeth 
. Why is that light blinking?” 
“Activity outside the surface 
entry door,” Mao III said quick- 
ly, his face blooming in a smile. 
“My generals — ” 

Pushing the proper combina- 
tion of buttons on the console 
brought a picture of workmen 
welding the steel frame for a steel 
safe door approximately one foot 
outside the surface entry door. 
They were working directly un- 
der the warning lens so that Dr. 
West was looking down at them. 
When he shifted to a second lens 



120 



GALAXY 



at an oblique angle, military of- 
ficers in black uniforms were re- 
vealed watching the work from 
further away within this great 
concrete surface blockhouse which 
was concealed within the ancient 
Winter Palace. 

“They are too small for me to 
recognize their faces,” Mao III 
muttered from his bed. “So our 
surface door will become a door 
within a door.” 

“Instead of simply welding our 
door shut.” Dr. West carried Mao 
Ill’s slack body to his chair. 

“Historically, Chinese are cau- 
tious because they are so intelli- 
gent,” Mao III said unselfcon- 
sciously. “Those who possess the 
key to the new outer door can 
reach me quickly enough when 
events so guide them. Welding 
my door completely shut would 
have seemed to irrevocable. There 
is more artistry in a door within 
a door. I may be needed tomor- 
row.” 

A fading illusion. Dr. West 
thought. We are being perman- 
ently sealed down here with the 
Esks. “There are too many Esks 
down here to be fed, and on the 
surface they are multiplying as 
if all the nations of the world 
have less foresight than ants.” Dr. 
West’s voice rose. “At least ants 
recognize intruders in their nest 
as enemies! I’ve got to get out of 
here.” 

“You fear even my Esk ser- 



vants?” Mao III asked and smil- 
ed. “Since I, too, once placed 
great value on survival when I 
was younger, there are freezers 
full of supplies in this vault for 
myself and fifty Esks for twenty 
years. The vault was constructed 
and stocked during a period when 
I thought tire American hawks 
were suicidally sincere in their 
talk of preventitive war. Breathe 
this sweet air. It is a recirculating 
system which cannot be poison- 
ed by surface assassins, either 
Chinese or American. We can 
wait, self-sufficient, safe, years 
longer than in a submarine. My 
vault is protected by 4,000 feet 
of solid rock. If the United States 
warmongers had attacked and 
won, amusing word, I could have 
waited down here like a Seven- 
teen-Year Locust and then 
emerged with my own personal 
Esks to repopulate the world.” 

An Esk carried away the 
breakfast tray. 

“You were looking at one of 
my sons,” Mao III said proudly. 
“Until my stroke three years ago 
I was extremely functional. The 
historical duty of a great man is 
to pass on his seed.” 

I n the concrete corridors which 
surrounded the inner vault, 
neatly uniformed Esks wandered 
as if there were not enough work 
to do. Dr. West noticed a few 
young Esks dressed in what ap- 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 



121 



peared to be bedsheets, as if there 
no longer were enough uniforms 
for an increasing number of Esks. 
Hordes of naked children skipped 
gaily ahead of him in the corri- 
dor. 

Beside Dr. West, an Esk push- 
ed Mao Ill’s wheelchair. 

“Already you are plotting how 
you can murder my children,” 
Mao III said pleasantly, as they 
passed the steel door to the tun- 
nel which led dawn to the atomic 
power source. 

“Speculative force of habit,” 
Dr. West replied as calmly. “Yes- 
terday, I showed one of your 
sons, or grandsons, how to con- 
duct a census by touching each 
Esk with a dab of red paint so 
he wouldn’t count the same child 
twice. I showed him how to make 
counting marks on a tablet. 
There are twenty-eight mature 
males, twenty-two breeding-age 
females and — brace yourself — 
396 children and babies.” 

“Under normal conditions the 
excess children are sent to the 
surface,” Mao III replied as if 
undisturbed. “It has been con- 
venient that the babies need to 
be breast fed for less than a 
month.” 

“Sixty-two of the children 
would reach breeding age if we 
were down here a year,” Dr. West 
remarked. “Of these, 32 are fe- 
male.” 

“It is unlikely we will be down 




122 



GALAXY 



here a week,” Mao III replied. 
“My generals will need me, as 
they always have needed the line 
of Maos.” 

“Then this is purely a theoreti- 
cal problem,” Dr. West shrilly 
laughed. “The 32 newly breeding 
females added to the 22 females 
now adult, means there would be 
54 breeding females within an- 
other year. Suppose we’re opti- 
mistic and estimate two men- 
strual wash-outs or miscarriages 
per mother during the next 12 
months, each of the 54 women 
would give birth to only 10 chil- 
dren instead of 12, for a total of 
540 more mouths to feed. And 
I’m forgetting to add children 
born to the 22 existing mothers 
this year.” 

“You’re talking as if we could 
be left to stagnate down here for 
two years,” Mao III laughed. 
“The generals will free me and 
kill you within a month.” 

“In two years, counting exist- 
ing Esks, mainly children now, 
plus babies who will be born, the 
total numbers of mouths to feed 
will be more than 1,000.” 

“You are intimating I lacked 
foresight because there are only 
supplies for fifty Esks for twenty 
years.” 

“Supplies for fifty Esks for 
twenty years equals supplies for 
1,000 Esks for one year.” Dr. 
West walked toward the myriad 
sounds of babies. 



“I am as familiar with arith- 
metic as you are,” Mao Ill’s 
voice retorted triumphantly. “I 
also am familiar with birth-con- 
trol pills.” 

“I can see from the age distri- 
bution of your Esks and the ter- 
rible preponderance of children, 
that no birth-control pills are be- 
ing used,” Dr. West said softly as 
he stepped into the crowded 
sleeping dormitory, his nose wrin- 
kling. 

“These are my grandchildren,” 
Mao III replied. “So there has 
been no reason to stifle my own 
ancestral line with pills. Do not 
panic. My generals will free me 
in a few days; and if the gener- 
als procrastinate and you become 
frightened of all those harmless 
Esks, there is a whole closet full 
of birth-control pills.” 

Dr. West blinked. He smiled 
fleetingly. 

“It might be wise to start test- 
ing these pills,” Dr. West remark- 
ed as if it were of no importance. 

He had glanced into the steam- 
blurred kitchen where Esks were 
boiling rice and freeze-dried veg- 
etables. “Supplies for fifty Esks 
for twenty years will last us one 
year unless the pills are effec- 
tive.” 

“We will not be down here 
three months.” Mao Ill’s tone of 
voice was a verbal shrug. “But 
you are a medical person, and it 
might add to your medical knowl- 



124 



GALAXY 



edge if you begin testing the 
quality of those pills. They were 
manufactured in the United 
States.” 

XTTT'hen Dr. West opened the 
* ' closet, he recognized the 
pills as an abortafacient develop- 
ed under the guidance of his suc- 
cessor at the Institute for Orien- 
tal Population Problems Re- 
search on a grant from the De- 
partment of Defense. Dr. West 
assumed they had been tested on 
Esks. Only one abortion-inducing 
pill a month was necessary. In 
Canada it had been found im- 
practical to force Esk women to 
take the daily pills. 

Taken only once a month, 
ideally before the woman had 
grown large from her monthly 
pregnancy, these abortafacients 
would do the job for a while if the 
Esk women would swallow them. 

Dr. West smiled grimly, think- 
ing: That brilliant mathemati- 
cian, Mao III, has stocked twen- 
ty large jars of 300 pills each. 
That’s 6,000 pills. Mathematical- 
ly, enough pills for 25 women for 
twenty years. Assuming the pills 
are 100% effective, by the time 
all the existing 396 children ma- 
ture, even assuming no new 
births, in three years we will have 
a total of 220 females of breeding 
age. They will need 2,640 pills 
each year. “There won’t be 
enough pills to complete the 



fourth year. Chemical birth con- 
trol will cease. Soon we’d be jam- 
med shoulder to shoulder except 
for one lucky circumstance. We 
already will have starved to 
death.” 

“But I’m ever the hopeful ex- 
perimenter.” Dr. West wondered 
if he would be more successful 
than the Canadians in inducing 
the Esk women to swallow 
monthly pills. “I can’t use force. 
Too many Esks. I can try decep- 
tion.” He slipped one bottle under 
his coat and carefully locked the 
closet. He frowned. Why did the 
Canadian government fail? 

He waded through naked chil- 
dren romping in the thermostati- 
cally heated corridor. 

The abortafacient pills so 
strongly contradict the Esk wom- 
en’s instinctive purpose in life, he 
thought, what awful things hap- 
pen when we trick their instinc- 
tive urge to give birth? 

In the crowded dormitory, he 
stared at an Esk woman sitting 
on the edge of a cot, hunching 
over her baby. Her strong hands 
were steadying her newborn baby 
who was hungrily suckling her 
breast. 

Genetically formed in both of 
you. Dr. West thought, is such an 
overwhelming urge to multiply. 
Even stronger than ours. 

He knew within the uterus of 
this blissful woman the next fer- 
tilized ovuurn already was cling-

ing, growing, already a fetus, ef- 
ficiently growing without wasted 
energy or unnecessary gills or 
prehuman tail, and in less than a 
month it would emerge into the 
world. Your whole being, all of 
those smiling instincts, your in- 
offensive survival instincts were 
designed by something to help 
your rapid multiplication. And 
you help each other. Unlike men, 
you don’t kill. Uneasily he smiled 
down at the woman, who cradled 
her baby protectively in her arms. 

Mother, he thought, would any- 
thing you suspect of interfering 
with your purpose in life cause 
you to — But I’ve never heard of 
Esks deliberately killing anyone , 
he thought. I should be safe 
enough. 

IT e gave twenty-two pills to the 

-*■ steward, who seemed unus- 
ually intelligent. Although his 
Esk characteristics were domi- 
nant, the steward undoubtedly 
was one of Mao Ill’s sons. He lis- 
tened placidly to Dr. West’s in- 
structions. “You understand,” Dr. 
West repeated, “these twenty-two 
calcium pills must be given only 
to each woman. That is, one to 
each woman.” 

“Eh?” The Esk smiled. 

“One pill for each woman in 
her rice,” Dr. West said. “To- 
night. Good calcium pills to make 
bones strong,” he lied. 

“For babies?” 



“No, for the mothers! Give the 
pills to the mothers.” 

As Dr. West returned to the 
Control Room, Mao III was lean- 
ing toward the telescreen, his 
skeletal face twisting in a comedy 
of outrage and black humor. Mao 
III blinked at the telescreen. 

“I am reported to be dying. A 
national year of mourning is be- 
ing prepared. This same day 
Chu-Ti’s personal aircraft has ex- 
ploded in flight, accidentally, the 
tele-announcers say. Lin Po died 
last night at a banquet, of indi- 
gestion. Here in Peking, Chen 
Young’s 8th Route Army has 
cancelled all leaves.” 

“In the south,” Mao III laugh- 
ed nervously, “Peng Huai’s troops 
have entered Canton to calm a 
very little disturbance caused by 
less than a dozen ancient reac- 
tionary revisionists who drank too 
much wine. His troops temporar- 
ily have occupied all the airfields 
and the television station.” Now 
Mao III laughed as faintly as the 
ghost of a man. “The Canton 
dogs say they are preparing for 
democratic elections. No doubt 
the general with the most troops 
hopes to receive the most votes.” 
“When their armies have blood- 
ied the streets,” Mao III mutter- 
ed, “and still the fighting contin- 
ues, they will remember me, their 
Saving Star.” He laughed faintly. 
“I can rise from the dead?” 
After a silence Mao III opened 



126 



GALAXY 



his eyes and announced: “The 
survivors will unlock my steel 
door, and I will permit them to 
come down in my elevator and 
bow down before me. Humbly 
the surviving generals will beg me 
once more to command all Chi- 
na.” 

Dr. West made no comment. 

np'he next day many television 
stations transmitted only 
their focusing pattern, the white 
lotus star. From the south, few 
broadcasts showed waving flags 
and martial music and schoolgirl 
poetesses with Cantonese accents 
reciting instant odes to the hero- 
ism and patriotism of General 
Peng Huai, Savior of Canton, Sa- 
vior of China. 

“Southern traitor,” Mao III 
blurted, and his quick fingers 
clicked through the other sta- 
tions. “This Cantonese rebellion 
will produce loyalty in Peking to 
me.” 

The next day none of the Pe- 
king stations were broadcasting. 

In the dormitory, Dr. West 
stared anxiously at the Esk wom- 
en. They should be aborting by 
now, he thought. None of them 
showed any discomfort. 

As he walked back along the 
corridor, Dr. West noticed a scar 
on the doorjamb of the closet, 
beside the lock. Breathing hard, 
he unlocked the closet door. The 
jars still were white with pills — 



no, with grains of rice. “The pills, 
where are the pills?” 

The steward continued smiling 
while Dr. West violently shook 
him. “Pills?” the Esk gasped. 
“Please, sir, which pills?” 

“Did you give Hie women the 
pills?” 

“Eh?” the Esk giggled with em- 
barrassment as Dr. West stopped 
shaking him. “This person gave 
away pills.” 

“You’re lying.” 

“Eh-eh, this person is lying.” 
the Esk laughed placatingly. 
“Where are all the other pills?” 
“Eh? Pills here? This person 
does not know.” 

“The whole closet was full of 
pills!” Dr. West shouted. 

“Eh-eh, this person is telling 
the truth. No pills.” 

“You’re lying.” 

“This person is lying,” the Esk 
patiently agreed as if soothing an 
insane man. 

Dr. West hurled the unresist- 
ing Esk to the floor. “Where are 
the pills?” 

By now most of the Chinese 
television stations were off the 
air. Some of Mao Ill’s random 
surveillance cameras, which were 
automatic equipment, showed cir- 
cling flies, perhaps distant air- 
craft circling clouds of smoke be- 
yond the horizon. 

One surveillance camera sud- 
denly blurred with the too close 
face of an Esk smiling stupidly. 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 



127 



That night Tele-Pravda's sat- 
ellite broadcast that General 
Peng Huai’s troops from Canton 
were meeting only token resist- 
ance outside Nanking. A victor- 
ious Cantonese television broad- 
cast was expected hourly. 

It came with joyful music and 
a triumvirate of smiling Chinese 
physicians, the first doctor an- 
nouncing that the beloved Chair- 
man, Mao III, was showing sup- 
erlogically materialistic improve- 
ment from his three-year illness. 
The second announced that new 
developments in traditional Chi- 
nese accupuncture had complete- 
ly cured the paralysis from 
which their beloved Chairman for 
three years had suffered. The 
third announced that the Chair- 
man, the Saving Star, now was 
able to speak to all of his people. 

In the dim vault, Dr. West 
watched Mao Ill’s expression 
change from surprise to rage to 
blankness. 

VII 

/^vn the telescreen a Mao III ap- 
peared, walking briskly for- 
ward. With sturdy peasant ges- 
tures and a confident voice, this 
Mao III reassured the world 
that: “The Maoist Party shines 
like a gun barrel! Your Chairman 
once again is able to labor for the 
welfare of the people. All is now 
peace, for I am with you.” 



This Mao glanced at the tele- 
prompter and announced that he 
had appointed General Peng 
Huai of the Canton Military Dis- 
trict to rebuild three bridges to 
the people, to assume three re- 
sponsibilities. “Minister of De- 
fense and Agriculture and In- 
ternal Security.” Pseudo-Mao 
bowed imperceptibly. “General 
Peng Huai, his heroism has saved 
my life, and through me the life 
of China.” 

“With Comrade Peng Huai’s 
guidance we shall build an even 
larger China, worthy of our great 
population. Together, arm-in- 
arm, we will lead all the free peo- 
ples of the world into the future.” 
Beside Dr. West, Mao III gur- 
gled with rage, and Dr, West re- 
marked: “Is that one of your for- 
mer doubles? You used so many 
to confuse your assassins. Now 
they’ve discovered one Mao is as 
good as another.” 

Mao III glowered at the wav- 
ing flags on the screen, the rising 
balloons, the traditional ranks of 
marching children, until the Can • 
ton station abruptly signed off 
the air. “Air raid warning!” 

“I will be rescued,” Mao III 
blurted. “My favorite general, 
Chen Yung, commander of my 
personal 8th Route Army here in 
Peking. Now he will need me to 
expose the imposter. My General 
Chen Yung personally will come 
and bow down before me.” 



128 



GALAXY 



There was more news about 
the air-raid scare. False warning. 

The next morning Tele-Pravda 
reported that General Chen 
Yung, Commander of the 8th 
Route Army based in Peking and 
formerly considered the most in- 
fluential of the inner council of 
generals, and the former favorite 
of Mao III, had been appointed 
Ambassador to South Belgium. 
“General Chen Yung already has 
departed to assume his new post.” 
“If his aircraft does not ex- 
plode in mid-air,” Mao III hissed 
and began to sob like a little boy 
who has lost his last toy. 

“Which leaves us with the 
Cantonese General Peng Huai 
consolidating his power.” Dr. 
West asked, “Do you recall Peng 
Huai’s attitude toward future in- 
crease of the Esks?” 

“That traitor first gained no- 
toriety as Field Commander in 
our pacification of India.” Mao 
III smiled crookedly at Dr. West. 
“Peng Huai always has maintain- 
ed that China will need many 
more people for a still greater ef- 
fort, therefore as many Esks as 
possible. Each Esk replaces on 
the homefront a peacefighter to 
free the world. Have I answered 
your question?” 

That night, Mao III cried out 
in pain. Rising, Dr. West saw that 
Mao III was suffering a more 
massive stroke. The whole left 
side of Mao Ill’s face was twist- 



ed down. Even when Dr. West’s 
mind strained to help, Mao III 
was unable to speak as his 
thoughts leaked out: Tapeworm, 
leave me alone. At least permit 
me to die. 

But Mao Ill’s right hand 
twitched in a signal for his Esk 
night servant to bring him a sip 
of water. 

Finally, Dr. West walked 
away. When Dr. West was able 
to escape into sleep, in his dream 
he was clutched by a nightmare 
earthquake shaking apart the ele- 
vator shaft to the surface, filling 
it with rubble, squeezing the vault 
while tire smiling Esks grew like 
balloons filling — 

''T^he bed shook him awake as he 
sat up, his eardrums still 
echoing the dull thud of an ex- 
plosion? 

The lights still worked. He 
blinked at the ceiling of new hair- 
line cracks in the concrete here 
4,000 feet deep in the earth. Now, 
through the ringing in his ears, 
he could hear the excited chatter- 
ing of Esks. 

He noticed an Esk standing 
stupidly by the locked control 
panel, an oddly shocked expres- 
sion for an Esk. No smile now. 
It was Mao Ill’s night servant. 
Swaying from the Esk’s hand 
hung a thin silver neck- chain 
dangling the key. 

Dr. West’s hand rose to his own 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE

neck where the key had been, and 
he bounded across the room, 
seized the key from the unresist- 
ing Esk. 

Dr. West stared at the lock 
turned to a horizontal position 
above the depressed red lever. 
“You idiot.” The dull thud had 
been an explosion at the surface. 

Dr. West remembered Mao 
Ill’s mental slip: The vault’s de- 
fensive threat was the small nuc 
device encased in tons of con- 
crete beneath the Winter Palace. 
As Mao Ill’s last act it could be 
detonated by this lock and red 
lever, to seal off this vault in 
which Dr. West stood breathing 
hoarsely forever. 

“You suicidal fool,” Dr. West 
blurted at the Esk. “And you 
stole it from me while I slept. 
T ell me why — ” 

The Esk smiled with nervous- 
ness and glanced toward the 
dragon-curtains of Mao Ill’s 
sleeping alcove. 

Dr. West tore open the cur- 
tains. “You paralyzed old fool. 
You communicated to this Esk 
to steal back your key. Wonder- 
ful! Bang! You’ve sealed us for- 
ever in this coffin.” 

Mao Ill’s lopsided face smiled 
up at him. Tapeworm. Fear? 
Mao Ill’s triumphant thought fil- 
tered out of his blood-clotted 
brain. You are unable to think. 
You must listen to my thoughts. 

“Like hell I will!” Dr. West 



ran along the corridor to the 
elevator. 

The elevator door bulged out 
jaggedly from the mass of 
smashed rock which had jammed 
down the shaft. 

He tried to calm his unevenly 
thudding heart. 

He walked to the end of the 
farthest concrete tunnel and star- 
ed at the concrete wall. “It is 
not possible to dig out. We’re 
nearly a mile beneath the earth.” 
He trudged slowly back with his 
hand pressed against his breast- 
bone and flickers of reflected pain 
inside his left arm. “If I’m going 
to drop dead — heart. Good! 
Now!” 

But he took a nitro. He 
searched through janitors’ closets 
and a small storeroom containing 
trays of spare modules for the 
computer and a vast storeroom 
of tiered shelves stacked with 
plastic-wrapped, freeze-dried veg- 
etable bricks. He wandered be- 
tween mountains of sacks of rice 
and on into the kitchen equip- 
ment room. 

By now he carried a crowbar 
he had found, and a handful of 
flimsy plastic-handled screw- 
drivers and a ball-peen hammer. 
He found a short-handled scoop- 
shovel for loading rice — not in- 
tended for digging straight up- 
ward through 4,000 feet of rock 
formations to the surface. “Got 
to get out!” 



130 



GALAXY 



"IT Then the next pain in his 
’ * chest subsided, he herded 
eight male Esks to the end of the 
corridor and set them to chipping 
at the concrete wall. The plastic 
split from the handles of the 
screwdrivers, and the soft iron 
shafts bent. The head of the ball- 
peen hammer popped off. The 
crowbar bounced back from the 
concrete with ringing protests. 

Dr. West located an electric 
twist drill and enough extension 
cords, and the whole set of steel 
drill bits soon was ruined. He un- 
bolted the hinges of the massive 
steel door of the Power Source 
room, and eight heavily breathing 
Esks carried the steel door up to 
the end of the corridor. The cor- 
ner of the steel door made a 
clumsy battering ram. The noise 
was deafening. Wincing, Dr. West 
stared toward the shower room 
and visualized a long hose. 

The concrete within the corri- 
dor wall seemed slightly softened 
after a stream of hot water was 
hose-lengthed from the shower 
room. 

“Cheap Maoist concrete,” he 
laughed shrilly. “But who could 
make a profit?” 

After exhausted relays of Esks, 
the clanging corner of the steel 
door smashed through concrete 
into darkness. 

Dr. West leaped forward as if 
into a miraculous hidden tunnel, 
but his flashlight illuminated 



only the yellow-brown solidity of 
prehistoric sandstone strata, 4,000 
feet beneath the present surface 
of the Earth. 

The battered point of the 
crowbar, hurled full force, pene- 
trated nearly an 1/8 inch into the 
sandstone. It left a tiny dent. 

“This damned sandstone’s 
been pressed down here so long 
and hard, it’s not even sedimen- 
tary. For me, it’s hard as meta- 
morphic.” Sourly smiling, Dr. 
West set the Esks chipping up- 
ward at a 45 -degree angle. “Not 
too steep for you to scramble up 
a gopher hole barefoot, yet steep 
enough for the debris to slide 
down.” 

He foresaw a narrow tunnel 
with one Esk digging at a time. It 
would have ventilating problems 
enough without being stuffed 
with other Esks passing the 
debris down by hand. He found 
a draftsman’s 45-degree triangle 
and tied a string to a bolt. He 
suspended the bolt from the tri- 
angle like a plumb-bob. “You 
see the direction? Dig upward in 
line with the hypotenuse of this 
triangle.” 

“Eh?” 

“I mean the tunnel must line 
up with this longest leg of the 
triangle.” 

“Eh?” These Esks all smiling 
stupidly made Dr. West want to 
scream with rage. 

Smile, Dr. West thought at the

cheerfully scurrying Esks, who al- 
ready were carrying away double 
handfuls of granulated sand- 
stone. Smile, at least this work 
gives you another purpose down 
here besides — 

Their primary purpose scam- 
pered small and naked on the 
corridor, more children each day. 
Children’s fingers traced child- 
ish symbols in the sand spilt on 
the corridor floor; circles, circles 
around circles and an amorphous 
blob reminding Dr. West of a 
bear. 

Tn the shoulder-wide hole up 
A into the hard sandstone Dr. 
West measured daily progress. “A 
good 3 feet in the last twenty- 
four hours. I like you, all of 
you. Now, dig faster!” 

Dr. West exploded in irrita- 
tion. “No! Don’t dump the sand 
in the shower room! Empty it in 
the food storeroom.” 

Each day there was more space 
in the food storeroom to store 
and — less rice. 

During the “night” shift be- 
low the sounds of the upward 
tunneling Esk, Dr. West scowled 
at his pencil diagram on the wall. 
It was a right triangle with its 
hypotenuse at a 45-degree an- 
gle to its vertical and horizontal 
lines. 

Beside the vertical line he 
wrote: 4,000 feet up. Beside the 
horizontal line, he also wrote 



4,000 feet. They would not 
emerge too near the small nuc 
blast. He scowled at the diagonal 
line symbolizing the tunnel. 
“This damn gopherhole hypot- 
enuse will be a lot longer than 
4,000 feet, you — ghost of Pytha- 
goras. The sum of the squares of 
the other two sides is 16,000,000 
plus 16,000,000 equals 32,000,- 
000. Now what in the hell is 
the square root of 32,000,000? It’s 
more than 5,000 feet! This slant- 
ing tunnel will be more than 
5,600 feet long. Digging 3 feet 
per day, that’s 1,866 days!” 
He stared at the unhearing 
Esks. “God help us all, 1,866 
days, that’s 5 years!” 

He walked into the food store- 
room where Esks were piling 
sand from the tunnel. “Even if 
these smiling fools could stop 
having babies right now, this 
minute, all the food, just for the 
Esks alive right now, will be 
eaten before two years. This stu- 
pid tunnel will starve to a stop 
not halfway to the surface.” He 
smiled like a starving clown. “We 
will have eaten ourselves to death 
three years below the surface.” 
I’m not going to murder any 
Esks, he thought. I don’t want to. 
If I killed a few, the others gent- 
ly will restrain me. If the humans 
on the surface can’t effectively 
control their increasing Esks, 
how can IP On the surface, the 
humans have the guns and are 



132 



GALAXY 



supposed to have the brains , but 
the Esks still are multiplying. 
Down here, I’m already outnum- 
bered 500-to-l, and more Esks 
are eating more each day. Could 
I create a poison? 

His face twisting from his 
heart pain, Dr. West looked 
across the food storeroom at the 
children laughing and rolling 
down the sandpile. At the edge, 
a little boy was dragging his 
finger in the sand so that the 
concrete floor showed through. 
“What are you drawing?” 
“Eh? Grandfather Bear — so 
he come for us.” 

“Down here?” 

“Eli!” The little boy shaped 
the sand and patted the sand. 

D r. West turned away, his 
chest tightening with pain. 
He sat down against the con- 
crete wall. A little girl ran over, 
threw her arms around his neck 
and snuggled on his lap. His 
breath tickled the delicate beau- 
ty of her ear, and she giggled. 
He closed his eyes, motionless 
and unbreathing as concrete. 
When she went away, he con- 
sidered suicide. 

Instead he gathered the 28 
adult men and the 22 mature 
women together, only now there 
were 30 mature men and 29 
pregnant women. He drew pic- 
tures on the wall showing the 
great distance to the surface. He 



drew squares of diminishing size 
showing that there soon would 
be no more food. The Esks gig- 
gled, and Dr. West saw thal 
one, aping him, was drawing or 
the floor — a bear? “Dammit 
listen to me! Something musl 
be done.” 

Smiling patiently, Esks volun- 
teered to eat less. One man would 
stand guard outside the food stor- 
age room. 

In the artificial night, children 
began to whine with hunger, dis- 
turbing Dr. West’s sleep. In the 
artificial morning, Dr. West read 
from small footprints in the sand 
that children had been allowed to 
enter the storeroom to gnaw at 
the freeze- dried vegetable bricks. 

When Dr. West tried rationing 
the food himself, after locking the 
storeroom, the Esks were cooper- 
ative. In the night hungry chil- 
dren cried, and the Esks gently 
took the key away from Dr. West 
without hurting him and opened 
the storeroom and everyone was 
happy again. 

When Dr. West stared down 
at Mao Ill’s lopsided face, the 
eye opened. Help me, the des- 
perate thought rose, to speak. 

Concentrating to the utmost, 
Dr. West was unable to control 
Mao Ill’s damaged speech cen- 
ter, and Dr. West thought! Only 
the spark of a man remains. 

Bad poetry while you look at 
my living corpse? Mao III

thought with surprising strength. 
Kinder to kill me. 

“Then who would I talk with?” 

How many Esks have you 
murdered? 

“None,” Dr. West answered. 

Fraud, you thought you could 
wive the Esk problems of the 
whole world, but you can't even 
control this vault. Mao Ill’s 
thoughts sparkled with laughter. 
Paint a line across the corridor, 
separating the men from the 
women. 

“You are taunting me,” Dr. 
West replied without anger. 

Induce the mothers to sacri- 
fice their babies to a god, either 
you or me. 

“In Canada the Esks shielded 
their babies from the mob with 
their own bodies.” 

Ineffective mobs in capitalistic 
countries. Arrange a mirror so 1 
can see the telescreen. 

“Strangely ineffective mobs. 
Your surface explosion destroyed 
our T.V. antenna.” 

If you understood statesman- 
ship, you would divide our Esks 
into two tribes. Paint the fore- 
heads of one tribe white, the other 
tribe black. 

“We both know they’re not 
that genetically combative. 
They’re not as self-limiting as 
some human populations have 
been. No wars.” 

Somewhere in the Data Re- 
trieval Computer, ancient Poly- 



nesian Island customs effective 
when not enough taro patches for 
growing population, and a pro- 
tein shortage. Use the pushbut- 
tons on the console. 

“Not any more. I was passing 
an hour playing the console, end- 
less interesting data pictures from 
your computer. Already I can 
play it like a piano. But sudden- 
ly, only a repeating pattern of 
information about weaving, vol- 
canos, avacados and phrenology 
appeared in the screen, as if the 
Data Retrieval System had suf- 
fered a stroke. I replaced what 
seemed to be the damaged mod- 
ule, and now the computer 
doesn’t work at all.” 

Because you have the wrong 
specialization, Doctor, you don't 
even understand any rational 
Maoist science. With minimal in- 
telligence you should be able to 
lead the Esks to the one logical 
course — cannibalism. 

44Qtop taunting me. There have 
been no examples of Esks 
killing each other for food, not 
in Canada — have there?” Dr. 
West wondered if, in the last ex- 
tremity of starvation and still 
driven by their urge to multiply, 
if the adult Esks here might feed 
their own bodies to their chil- 
dren. “I doubt it. At least not 
organized — ” 

Not yet organized makes it 
easier for you. There are no 



134 



GALAXY 



troublesome congenital leaders 
among the Esks. You should be 
able to organize these few Esks 
in any behavior pattern you de- 
cide. 

You flatter me. For me, one 
man, now to curb the Esks’ over- 
powering instinct to multiply like 
lemmings, after all the Canadian 
attempts to organize birth control 
among the Esks failed.” 

My Szechuan agricultural 
planners easily organized millions 
of Esks to hand shape mountains 
into rice paddies. 

“Easy because it was helping 
Esks multiply.” 

For Maoist progress, yes, Esks 
were so much more easily con- 
trollable than Chinese within my 
twenty-year plan. If you imagine 
yourself my intellectual equal, 
you should be able to organize 
the lives of these mere 500 Esks 
so that one of their overpowering 
instincts will conflict with an- 
other, and they will destroy 
themselves. This is how I main- 
tained control over my generals. 

“And look at you now!” Dr. 
West immediately realized his 
own retort was inadequate, child- 
ish because Mao III had retained 
power longer than most leaders; 
any leader can suffer a brain- 
stroke, and all men sink into 
death. 

Having nothing better to do to- 
day, I am trying to help you. 

“I doubt that!” Dr. West 




THE PURPOSE OF LIFE

seemed unable to restrain child- 
ish anger, “How were you so 
stupid as to help Esks multiply 
like a billion cancer cells in 
China? Brilliant leader, you can’t 
answer. Perhaps Esks have an 
as yet unidentified psychological 
advantage. Unobtrusively they 
are leading us.” 

Ridiculous! You are a defeat- 
ist born of a disorganized nation 
whose historical moment has 
passed. If my television still were 
operating, while you starve you 
could watch the triumph of Mao- 
ism throughout the world. 

“Triumph? The population of 
the world already is 6 billion 
humans, 2 billion Esks. Next year 
there will be 6 % billion humans 
and 4 billion Esks. The next year 
6 l /2 billion humans and 8 billion 
Esks.” 

Statistical trickster. Any fool 
knows that the rate of Esk in- 
crease will stow down and then 
stop. In America, when your rela- 
tives feel the bite of hunger in 
their fat bellies, they will limit 
their Esks. With guns and clubs 
of necessary. In China, rational 
Maoist economic planning will 
reveal when the number of Chin- 
ese Esks is optimum, and further 
increase will be discouraged. 

“Are you sure? That is not 
how things ended in Canada. Is it 
possible that the Esks have an 
over-group psychological influ- 
ence on our actions?” 



Now you are a small boy 
whimpering at the darkness 
which conceals nothing but your 
teddy bears. 

A t this thought, Dr. West 
broke into laughter like dry 
coughing. “I’ve been a small boy 
— whimpering, warning for 
twenty years. And ever since the 
first five years, those first Cana- 
dian years, the Esks have been 
recognized as a population prob- 
lem But they have continued 
increasing. Name for me one in- 
stance in which organized human 
activity effectively has limited 
the number of Esks anywhere. 
The few lynchings, your experi- 
mental napalm, ineffective pin- 
pricks! Name an effective popu- 
lation control action. It’s been all 
talk, and the number of Esks 
keep increasing.” 

Loud prophet, emerge from 
your hole and take action, Mao 
III taunted. There still is time. 
I have been told that the world 
can support a population of 24 
billion. 

“Only if the number is ap- 
proached gradually over the next 
hundred years. Even with only 
more humans breathing on our 
necks, we haven’t time, even with 
developing marine plankton 
farming and direct chemical food 
sources. Why am I wasting my 
time talking to you? Up there, 
anarchic collapse will come be- 



136 



GALAXY 



fore the population totals twelve 
billion, and after disorganization 
of food distribution, the world 
won’t support two billion. 

It would support more Esks 
than that, Mao III taunted. They 
don’t eat as much. Because they 
are here, Esks who worship — 

Dr. West whirled, staring in 
recognition at the gold-painted 
dragon which still grinned above 
the blinded telescreen. The drag- 
on’s claws were painted red. His 
hungry jaws symbolized — 

“Malthusian nightmare!” Dr. 
West’s voice shouted. “Or Freu- 
dian dinosaur. You’ll symbolize 
whatever I want you to symbol- 
ize. 

He clutched his head in his 
hands, trying to understand the 
Esks. 

In creation, an effective reli- 
gion also must conform to the 
most pressing needs, Dr. West 
thought, of its creator. 

He stalked through corridors 
where the Esks merely stepped 
aside. He unlocked the huge 
empty room Mao Ill’s architects 
must have intended for — 
“Official Audiences, but these 
last 3 years since his stroke, that 
egomaniac was afraid, avoided 
being seen. I’ll meet with all 80 
adult Esks at one time, only I 
won’t be here.” Dr. West locked 
the door from the inside and set 
to work inside of the Audience 
Room. 



VIII 

W hen he emerged wearily, his 
work incomplete, he lock- 
ed the door to the huge room 
behind him and wandered back 
to the Control Room to sleep. 
But first, in the Control Room 
he unlocked the Master Heating 
Panel and did something. “Like 
a god, I control the weather.” 
When he awoke he was shiv- 
ering slightly. As he walked past 
Mao Ill’s curtained bed, he de- 
tected distress, shivering, but 
continued to the Master Heating 
Panel, unlocking its little metal 
door again. 

Inside gleamed the row of tem- 
perature control dials, one for 
each room in the vault, others 
for the corridors. 

Only their coil thermometers 
were concealed in the individual 
rooms. The other elements of 
each thermostat were here in 
front of him. 

“Maoist architecture — cen- 
tral control of all thermostat set- 
tings.” With a cold smile he 
turned down each thermostat an- 
other degree. “This control room 
also must be equally chilled or 
eventually, as the Esks become 
painfully cold, they’ll all crowd 
in here, squeezing around me like 
a demographer’s nightmore of the 
1000% utilized planet. At first 
there must be equal cold through- 
out the vault.” 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 



137 



Dr. West located extra blankets 
for Mao III. 

Apparently in China, Dr. West 
thought with wry humor, or at 
least in this Command Vault, 
electric blankets are banned tor 
their softening revisionist tenden- 
cies. He suspended a small elec- 
tric radiant heater above Mao 
Ill’s curtained bed. 

I am shivering. My tapeworm, 
who will soon be without a host. 
Why not painlessly smother me 
with a pillow instead of chilling 
me to pneumonia, to which I 
already have been susceptible. I 
wish to die, but I dread the chok- 
ing sensation of pneumonia fluid 
in the lungs. Simply use a pillow. 

“I’m not your assassin. I’d be 
lonely without you, mine host.” 
Dr. West went away to get the 
paint and loudspeakers; laden 
with tools, he unlocked the 
Audience Room. 

Each day he worked alone in 
the huge hollow-sounding Audi- 
ence Room. After he had hung 
the black curtains the echoes 
were muffled. 

Each day he reduced the tem- 
perature throughout the vault 
one degree. As a side effect of 
the cold, the Esks digging the 
tunnel worked faster. Dr. West 
soon wore overshoes with three 
pairs of socks. Chilled, he donned 
two layers of padded uniforms 
and wrapped a blanket around 
his shoulders and ate more. 



Unfortunately, the Esks also 
ate more. Since few of the chil- 
dren had shoes, whenever they 
tjred of running around they 
huddled rubbing their feet, whim- 
pering. 

“But human children would 
have colds and pneumonia.” Dr. 
West coughed and laughed and 
cleared his phlegmed throat. 
“Comes another Ice Age, only 
Esks would prosper.” 

With disturbing initiative the 
Esks in the kitchen left the elec- 
tric cookstoves on all the time. 
Esks smashed chairs in the dorm- 
itory and built a fire nearly 
overpowering the carbon dioxide- 
monoxide filters. 

“Dammit, you nearly fumigat- 
ed us all.” As Dr. West stamped 
out the fire, he felt a gentle hand 
on his shoulder. The Esks were 
on the verge of restraining him. 
He wondered, if warmth had be- 
come so vital an instinct that 
they would — 

“Warm today, disregard to- 
morrow,” Dr. West muttered his 
conscious superiority at these 
people, but he worried that 
eventually the Esk servants 
might realize how the thermo- . 
static heating system was con- 
trolled, and the Esks gently 
would take control of the weather 
in the vault. 

T T e accelerated his plan. Un-

Panel, he turned up on thermo- 
stat. It was the thermostat whose 
coiled thermometer element was 
in the Audience Room. “Warmth 
will become like heaven.” 

When he unlocked the warm 
Audience Room, delicious warmth 
spread outward to the chilled 
faces of children in the corri- 
dor. He said: “Go away.” But 
elusive children slipped by him. 

“Stay out! This is for adults.” 
He discovered there was no way 
to keep the children out. 

The crowding Esks were so 
solicituous of their children that 
they smilingly ignored his pro- 
tests and pushed their children 
past him into the darkly warm 
Audience Room. The women car- 
ried their babies in their arms 
into the heavenly warmth. The 
room jammed with all 800 Esks. 
He’d intended only the 80 adults. 
Shoulder- to -shoulder, luxuriating 
in warmth, the Esks were smiling 
sleepily at the black curtain Dr. 
West had arranged to conceal the 
loudspeaker. Now they were 
peering with recognition, with 
whispering excitement, at the 
life-size portrait Dr. West had 
created on the black curtain with 
white paint. Before leaving the 
dim room, Dr. West switched on 
the spotlight. 

Against the curtain, the spot- 
light’s circle enshrined the im- 
mense snow whiteness of the po- 
lar bear. 



Hypnotically humming be- 
hind, the curtain, the electric fan 
made the curtain undulate, and 
the bear moved. In the sleepy 
warmth, long staring into or 
from the centered whiteness, the 
gigantic polar bear seemed, even 
to Dr. West’s eyes, to be en- 
larging. 

Children whimpered, gasping 
for breath in the thickening at- 
mosphere. Dr. West slipped out 
of the over- crowded Audience 
Room into the cold reality of 
the corridor. He hurried along 
the concrete corridor to the Con- 
trol Room. 

Plis heart drumming with ex- 
citement, he stared at the closed- 
circuit image being transmitted 
to the telescreen from the Audi- 
ence Room. He pursed his lips 
and blew softly against the 
microphone on the control panel. 

On the telescreen, from the 
Audience Room, the thickly 
crowded Esks seemed to sway. 
He was seeing them from the 
camera eye high in the curtain 
above the bear. He felt himself 
high above the multitude, as if 
floating above the excited smil- 
ing faces of the Esks. 

Are there instincts stronger 
than life? Dr. West thought, 
stronger than this multiplying 
like rodents for no purpose other 
than more life itself? Is this the 
end purpose for which the Esks 
were planted on this Earth? 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE

66T ook at me,” Dr. West 
' breathed in Modem Eski- 
mo, and the Esks’ eyes widened. 
He knew they did not compre- 
hend his Eskimo words, and he 
inhaled, preparing to speak to 
them in the simplified Chinese 
that their recent Esk progeni- 
tors had absorbed during these 
fifteen Chinese years since they 
were flown here from the Arc- 
tic winter night. 

For many nights he had been 
planning what he would say, 
remembering what he had said 
before, remembering the prophe- 
tic excitement in the igloo so 
long ago. In the night, Edward- 
luk, who was not an Eskimo, 
rose on the ice, shouting with 
expectant joy, Edwardluk’s arms 
reaching toward the Arctic Stars, 
ice-bright galaxies where man 
could never go. “Grandfather!” 
As. Dr. West spoke into the 
microphone, his plans vanished, 
and his voice poured out with 
unthinking freedom. 

“ — the darkness, the light 
from the sky, I am white bear, 
your Grandfather in front of 
you, all around you, above you, 
I am your Grandfather of whom 
you dream. Like a white bear 
from the sky, you see me com- 
ing for you. In joy your heart- 
beats are rising to the sky so 
that all become one with me. 



I in you, and you in me. We 
rise! We rise!” 

On the telescreen the images 
of the Esks swayed forward to- 
ward his voice. 

“You have filled the world 
for me, and now I have come 
for you and we become one 
again,” Dr. West’s hoarse voice 
paraphrased the myth. “In joy 
we become one!” 

Esk faces were shrieking up- 
ward with joy or agony. Esks 
were rising on tip toe. It seem- 
ed as if the hair of an Esk man 
was standing on end. He fell 
-down, convulsing like a man be- 
ing electrocuted, and became 
motionless, concealed by the 
pressing multitude. As if un- 
aware of his fall, the other 
adults were straining forward 
sobbing with joy, and a woman 
fell among the shrieking, scam- 
pering, wide-eyed children who 
had been forgotten and were be- 
ing trampled. 

“Grandfather, we have pre- 
pared this world for you. Grand- 
father! Grandfather!” He saw 
another man’s face ripen in 
an agony of joy, and his hair 
was standing on end just be- 
fore his body toppled. Beside 
him, a woman in joy had fallen, 
vanished. A slender man, barely 
matured, frantically was beat- 
ing the walls with his hands, as 
if trying to climb. In the tur- 
moil, children must be scream-

ing. In joy, a woman strained 
upward and fell. “Grandfather!” 

Dr. West’s face twisted with 
pain. He was crying. 

Children were being trampled. 

He switched off the micro- 
phone, which had transmitted his 
voice behind the black curtain to 
the loudspeaker. On the black 
curtain, the whiteness of the bear 
vanished as he pulled the switch 
that plunged the Audience 
Room into darkness. His trem- 
bling hand reached into the 
Master Heating Panel and turn- 
ed down the thermostat con- 
trolling Audience Room. He 
directed the icy blast of air 
conditioning into the Audience 
Room. 

He stood in the corridor 
watching crying children flee the 
cold wind from the Audience 
Room. 

A few adults staggered out 
with faces waxy as corpses. They 
shuffled away along the cor- 
ridor. A moaning mother car- 
ried her little girl who had been 
trampled. 

In the Audience Room, his 
flashlight beam flittered like a 
white moth over slack faces of 
ten adult Esks. He knelt, feeling 
for the pulse. This Esk was 
dead. “God help us all.” 

Tomorrow he would guide the 
Esks to remove the bodies. His 
eyes narrowed as he went out 
into the light of the corridor. 



He was afraid to drag away the 
bodies himself because the Esks 
would see this. They might see 
a casual connection between the 
dead Esks and him. 

I did not murder them. They 
wanted to go. They were hoping 
to go. Dr. West rationalized. 
They behaved as if going was 
the purpose of their lives. “They 
were shouting with happiness.” 
And I should feel relief, Dr. 
West thought. I can control their 
numbers now. It may be possi- 
ble to reach the surface if we 
try. 

D r. West collapsed face down 
on his bed, groaning. It was 
many hours before he regained 
the self-control and purpose to 
get out of bed, to send the Esks 
back to the tunnel. But he found 
they were already digging. 

Much faster and more pur- 
posefully than before, the sur- 
viving adult Esks were digging 
upward and carrying away blue- 
gray rock. They were smiling. 

“Smile at what? At what is 
happening up there, years above 
our heads?” Dr. West was not 
smiling. “Dig faster!” 

Broken blue rock rumbled out 
of the steep tunnel. 

“We are rising through a 
pond,” Dr. West announced as 
if the loudness of his voice could 
make the stupidly smiling Esks 
understand. “You are digging

upward through blue silt which 
has become stone. Yes, giggle. 
Do you realize how many mil- 
lion years we are buried beneath 
the surface? Dig!” 

He blinked at a chalky white- 
ness of a tooth too huge to be 
mammalian. “My god, how deep 
are we? We’ll never get out.” 

A clumsy Esk dropped an- 
other slab and giggled. Beside 
his foot it had split, and in this 
flat-faced stone there curved like 
a tiny white necklace a pattern 
of small teeth in a lower jaw. 

“Specialized teeth. Extremely 
specialized for a little reptile.” 
He bent over this fossil as if 
searching for a key to its time. 
Within Dr. West’s eyes, the pu- 
pils like dark mushroom exten- 
sions of his brain enlarged with 
excitement. He was remembering 
himself as a sleepy pre-med stu- 
dent, a zoology lecture and dia- 
grams so long ago. “The dental 
formula of this little ' creature in 
my hand — ” Incisors 3/3. Ca- 
nines 1/1. Premolars 4/4. Mo- 
lars 3/3. A little shrewlike ani- 
mal? “Beautiful! We’re going to 
escape from these damn dino- 
saurs.” 

He laughed too loudly. “Dig, 
Already, I think, we’re up in the 
Late Cretaceous. We’re • burrow- 
ing up into the Paleocene, up 
toward the Eocene. We may be 
less than 80 million years from 
the surface,” he said with irony. 



“We’re clawing at the bottom of 
the Age of Mammals.” 

“It means nothing to you be- 
cause you were not born of this 
planet,” he told the patiently 
smiling faces of the Esks. “But 
to me! Do you know,” he laugh- 
ed, “we’re already entering the 
top layer of my planet’s cake. 
We’re already standing on top 
of 4 ' billion years of life strug- 
gling up from the hot rocks of 
this planet. It’s my planet, not 
yours.” 

“Eh?” 

“Smile. Dig! We’ll reach the 
surface and find out whose plan- 
et it is.” Dr. West stalked off 
toward the Control Room be- 
cause he needed to talk to a 
human being. 

“I found mammalian teeth!” 
Dr. West’s lonely voice rose with 
boyish excitement. “We’ll get 
out of here. Digging up through 
— life,” he laughed, “from the 
bottom up — ” 

Mao III appeared dead. 

Tapeworm, kill me, fiend, 
please free me, Mao Ill’s 
thoughs screamed soundlessly 
into Dr. West’s brain. Have you 
no humane conception of euth- 
anasia? Press the pillow against 
my face. So simple. Lean on it. 
Please. 

But Dr. West walked away 
from the agony of paralysis, his 
fingernails gouging his palms. I 
-should kill him. He knew he was 



142 



GALAXY 



vacillating within neurotic in- 
decisiveness. He passed the Esk 
servant approaching to pour 
water into Mao Ill’s throat 
tubes as if tending a vegetable. 

“When he dies, I’ll be alone 
for four or five years.” Dr. West 
walked in sweat. “Alone with 
more Esks every day unless 
I — ” 

Dr. West procrastinated. 

View and beautiful little girls 

’ and boys scampered in the 
corridor, laughing and playing 
in their world. Stream-bed gra- 
vel rattled out of the long 45- 
degree tunnel for them to play 
with, followed by a thud of min- 
eralized bone. 

“Yes, giggle. Heavy rock for 
little girl. But I see an Oligo- 
cene beast with bones like small 
tuskless elephant. Perhaps you 
have a right to laugh. Perhaps 
this bone you are playing with 
is only an evolutionary dead- 
end.” 

He knew he had to kill more 
of these people. 

When he opened his eyes, Dr. 
West stared at a fanlike spread 
of smaller bones in a water- 
smoothed boulder. “Fragile as 
a little hand. “Dammit!” He felt 
anger at the prehistoric stream 
bed for eroding strata, treach- 
erously restacking fossils and 
disordering time. “Protosimian 
fingers. But where are we? Up 



to Miocene? No. I feel as though 
we’re still buried at least 60 
million years beneath the sur- 
face.” 

Dr. West procrastinated, slept 
poorly as he chilled the vault 
preparartory to luring the Esks 
back to the Audience Room 
where the white bear waited. 
He faced the day with the hor- 
ror and fascination of an execu- 
tioner, a torero, a bomber pilot. 
As he watched on the telescreen 
the closed-circuit transmission of 
the Esks jamming into the Audi- 
ence Room, he felt nauseated. 
His face twisted in a sour smile. 
“Either I’m burdened with ab- 
normal guilt feelings, or — ” 

His fingers played with the 
microphone switch. If I don’t do 
this — He thought of ancient 
military men stationed at Buch- 
enwald and other airfields 
throughout the world. Was it de- 
lighted horror which squirmed 
within their armor of pride in 
professional skill and devotion 
to duty? “It is justified because 
there is not enough food. I must 
do it as quickly and painlessly 
as my skill will allow. They 
would all die anyway — some 
day.” 

“Look at me, coming down 
to you — ” 

Afterward he showed the sur- 
viving adults how to stack the 
bodies neatly in the freezing 
chamber which once had con-

tained food. He tried to give 
first aid to children who had 
been crushed in the ecstatic 
stampede. He tried to comfort 
children whose mothers now 
were refrigerated. And he shoved 
a surviving male up the tunnel 
to dig. In loneliness he walked 
back to the familiar hatred of 
Mao III. 

D r. West laughed thinly. “The 
Esks say those who have 
died have risen into happiness.” 
Tapeworm, you tear to kill 
me. It cannot be simply because 
I desire death that you refuse 
to release me. You are not that 
cruel? Mao III lay totally par- 
alyzed, begging. 

But the tube Dr. West had 
taped in the corner of Mao Ill’s 
mouth implacably seeped liquid 
nourishment into Mao Ill’s 
stomach. 

Tapeworm, when your host 
dies do you fear everything dies? 
When I die, you die! I die: the 
Universe dies. You, you billions 
of tapeworms who exist only in 
my consciousness, of course you 
try to keep me alive. You fear 
without me — 

“Taunting me won’t make me 
kill you,” Dr. West muttered. 

But I need to die. Torturer! 
Let me die. 

His face twisting with sympa- 
thetic pain, Dr. West walked 
away in a closing circle of lone- 



liness like a clear ice cave. 

He suspected at least three 
years stretched ahead before the 
Esk tunnel possibly could reach 
the surface. I’ll lose control of 
myself before then, alone with 
my victims, smiling Esks, Dr. 
West thought. God help me, and 
up above, on the surface of the 
Earth, billions of smiling crowd- 
ing faceless Esks! 

Dr. West walked into the 
bathroom and stared at the ra- 
zor blade. I’ll leave now. The 
razor blade gleamed between his 
fingertips. 

“You sick coward, you’d never 
find out what happens!” Dr. 
West threw the razor blade into 
the wash basin. He glimpsed his 
wry, thin face turning in the 
mirror as he walked out of the 
bathroom. He walked back to- 
ward the cruel little prison 
which was Mao Ill’s body. 

And on past it away from 
Mao III, he hurried into the 
corridor where smiling Esk chil- 
dren scampered away and the 
handful of breeding adults car- 
ried sand and rock from the 
tunnel to the supply room where 
more heaps of sand replaced 
sacks of rice each day. 

“Dig faster!’ he shouted use- 
lessly up the thin tunnel which 
had only elbow room for one 
Esk to dig at a time, and a rat- 
tling of descending rocks rolled 
down at him. 



144 



GALAXY 



“Miocene dust, a local dry 
period, you stupidly smiling geo- 
logists. Yes, smile at the brown 
ridge on this rock. Smile stupid- 
ly because the little animal 
whose straight femur this was, 
who crept down to drink, may 
have been my ancestor. He sure 
as hell wasn’t yours!” 

Brown stone from hardened 
grasslands, then darker stone 
formed in temperate forests slid 
down the tunnel each day, grad- 
ually reddening to rain-leached 
laterite stone typical of rain for- 
ests. “The rainy sweep of the 
cycle, and now blue swampy 
clay.” 

In a discharge of blue slabs 
from the tunnel tumbled a mas- 
sive thud, a giant’s bone, fol- 
lowed by an odd-shaped white 
— “A flat tooth as big as a 
spade. A shovel- jawed masto- 
don. Pliocene? Only 30 million 
years from the surface.” 

“Dig!” Dr. West laughed like 
a crazy man. “Dig, you smiling 
fools, at this rate only two 
more years to go. Your children 
will see the sun.” 

You won’t. Dr. West thought, 
staring at the bent back of an 
Esk woman sweeping little rocks 
into a frying pan. He glanced 
toward the supply room. Always 
too many mouths were being 
born again. He counted sacks of 
rice. Again the white bear. 
Grandfather Bear, if you are up 



there in the sky, accept these, 
your children. 

“But what am I?” He knew 
now he had the strength to reach 
the surface. “But is my world 
still there?” 

D r. West walked to the Con- 
trol room to turn down the 
thermostats. With extra blank- 
ets, he bent over the withered 
remnant of Mao III. The par- 
alyzed man’s trapped thoughts 
frantically raced and squirmed 
like agonized white rats. 

Dr. West stood in the scream- 
ing wind of Mao Ill’s incoher- 
ent thoughts. A dagger appear- 
ed, as if a mind could stab it- 
self to death with a visualized 
dagger. Now the dagger struck 
out at Dr. West, and he felt 
a sharp stinging as if the be- 
ginning of a tiny stroke spread- 
ing within his own brain. He 
bowed his head in the rain of 
Mao Ill’s inner sobbing. 

Tapeworm, my friend, my last 
contact with life, please kill me. 

Dr. West’s hand lay gently on 
Mao Ill’s throat, and his thumb 
and forefinger closed on the twin 
faint pulsations of the carotid 
arteries. He felt gratitude like 
sparks of laughter from Mao 
III. 

Pressing in, his forefinger and 
opposed thumb narrowed the 
flow from heart to brain until 
the last vivid picture — armies 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 



145 



of Chinese children with white 
balloons marching along the pink 
walls of the Great Square turned 
gray in Mao Ill’s blood-starv- 
ing brain. Dr. West glimpsed a 
single huge gray — What was 
it? A loud squawling seemed to 
emerge from within himself, and 
he realized he was seeing upward 
through the eyes of a baby in- 
stinctively loudly commanding 
food, warmth, love. A huge gray 
hand was descending. 

Into his crib? Dr. West 
couldn’t see. There was nothing. 
He opened his eyes at the waxen 
face of Mao III. Beneath Dr. 
West’s fingertips there was no 
pulse in the throat arteries. From 
Mao Ill’s brain, his own para- 
sitic brain no longer could feel 
organized electrical activity. In 
fifteen minutes Dr. West con- 
firmed irreversible clinical death. 

He did not freeze Mao Ill’s 
body. Somberly, he buried it un- 
der Pliocene sand in the supply 
room, and smiling Esks emptied 
soup pans full of broken rock 
from the tunnel face on to that 
growing pile of debris, and smil- 
ed and smiled. 

“I’m alone with you now. I 
just hope that others of me are 
still alive on the surface.” 

“Eh?” 

“So you don’t understand. You 
see this sliver of bone on my 
hand — from the rock. Wolf, 
hyena, baboon or undiscovered 



anthropoid, who ran on the 
ground upright — I don’t know. 
All I know, this fossilized bone 
and I are more closely related 
than you and I. The ancient im- 
prints in my cells have been 
continuously reshaped by this 
Earth for 4 billion years. You — 
your ancestors have been part of 
this world less than fifty years. 
I belong here. Your progenitor 
invaded. I think you were sent 
here for a purpose. Now you 
are digging upward. But where 
are you going?” 

“Eh?” 

Dr. West talked to the Esks 
a great deal now. It was another 
form of talking to himself. 
Warmed by fermented rice wine, 
Dr. West liked to shout at the 
ceiling. “Up there in the sky, 
come down here to hell, Grand- 
father Bear.” 

T>ut one day it was the Esks, 
* ' who were staring at the ceil- 
ing; and they were smiling, 
laughing, and running about in 
confusion. Shouting with joy, 
some of the adults scrambled in- 
to the tunnel, struggling upward. 

“No! No! You’ll smother the 
man digging. We’re still a thou- 
sand feet below the surface.” Dr. 
West kept trying to pull them 
back, but they wriggled free, 
stronger and so much younger 
than he. 

Those who couldn’t force their 



146 



GALAXY 



way into the tunnel ran against 
the walls, climbed on chairs. As 
the excitement grew, shouting 
Esks tried to climb the walls 
while their children whimpered 
uncomprehendingly. In mount- 
ing desperation, an Esk man 
stretched his arms toward the 
ceiling: “Wait. Wait for me, 

please.” 

Dr. West grabbed an Esk 
woman. “Dammit, what’s hap- 
pening?” 

“Eh? Let me go, please. All 
becoming one.” Her excited 
laughter gradually muted to 
frustrated sobs, and some of the 
Esks sagged down on the cor- 
ridor floor. They seemed so 
strange without smiles. 

Esks slept in exhaustion where 
they lay, and their nonplussed 
children scampered around them 
whining and playing. It was Dr. 
West who had to drag the smoth- 
ered bodies out of the tunnel. It 
was Dr. West who boiled the 
great tub of rice for the children, 
while the surviving adults sat 
stunned with disappointment. 

Lethargic, they had to be loud- 
ly ordered to work in the tunnel. 
It seems strange to see Esks who 
do not smile. They droop as it 
they no longer have a purpose in 
life. 

They cannot know what has 
happened at the surface, Dr. 
West thought. But their organ- 
isms knew something was hap- 



pening, and now it has stopped. 
“You, there, hurry up, carry that 
sand to the supply room. We’ll 
never reach the surface unless 
everyone works the way you used 
to.” 

Something had happened up 
there. Down here the Esks ceas- 
ed to mate. The last babies 
emerged too soon, as if cast out, 
spontaneous abortions, dead. 

Dr. West resorted to shouts 
and shoves to make the Esks 
dig. 

“Dammit, why have you lost 
your purpose in life?” 

“Eh?” 

Now the swarm of older chil- 
dren were better diggers than 
their parents, and the tunnel pro- 
ceeded under Dr. West’s constant 
direction. Their lives required so 
much more guidance and reas- 
surance now from Dr. West, he 
began to feel like the father. 

“Dig! That’s the way. We’re 
nearer the surface every day.” 
Pleistocene gravel less than a 
million years old was rattling 
out of the tunnel. “Dig my chil- 
dren, and we’ll see the Earth.” 

X 

Oometimes Dr. West dreamed 
^ the surface was green with 
willow trees along a silvery 
brook, and from his childhood he 
poked sticks deep into the water 
which bent them. He dipped his 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 



147 



face in the cool water and raised 
his head. Behind him the sur- 
face of the Earth was barren and 
dry, all life obliterated. 

“Which is it?” He awoke, and 
when he slept again the cities 
hummed with life as if he’d nev- 
er been away, and the humming 
grew and spread shoulder pack- 
ed against shoulder in a solid 
mass of Esks spreading through 
the streets. Where were his par- 
ents? The surface of the Earth 
turned black with bobbing heads 
of Esks, and the humming rose 
while their heads drooped, and 
the Esks died in sagging masses 
melting into a golden honey, 
gleaming and flowing between 
the buildings and down the val- 
leys. Like golden honey it cov- 
ered the Earth, and he moaned 
as the humming grew louder 
coming down from the sky, and 
Dr. West tried to look up. 

He blundered into the corridor 
toward the chattering voices of 
the Esks. They were carrying 
black clods from the mouth of 
the tunnel. He awakened fully. 
It was hard dirt, almost rock, 
flecked with bone, yet blackened 
as if by an ancient campfire. 

His fingers picked out a glint 
of sharpness. “Flake of flint. Dig, 
my children! We’ve reached the 
age of Man!” 

He laughed. “Peking Man? 
True man? Who knows what 
man? Ancestor, we’ve passed 



you.” He poked at slender hu- 
manoid femurs split for their 
marrow. “You Paleolithic canni- 
bals! We’re trying to pass you. 
By stepping on your heads, we’ll 
get out.” 

Day after day the dark rock 
became lighter colored, more 
sandy. 

Out of the tunnel bumped 
chunks of compacted loess dust. 
“The climate has dried. Cold 
dusty winds from the advanc- 
ing arctic may have driven man 
away from this place. Is the ice 
approaching?” 

But the next day, in a crum- 
bling yellow cloud, which had 
been loess dust, gleamed a beau- 
tiful leaf-shaped javelin head with 
delicately pressure-flaked edges. 
“Sharp as the day you made 
it. And this sharp splinter, was 
it an awl? We’re up among the 
real men now, who outsmart the 
cold, perhaps in intricately sewn 
wild reindeer skins.” 

Dr. West stared up the tunnel 
hole. “Am I the first amateur 
archeologist to make his dig 
from the bottom up? Dig!” he 
laughed, excitedly. “We are the 
first to have this perspective, a 
proctologist’s view of civiliza- 
tion.” 

As the tunnel extended up- 
ward, shards of fire-burned pot- 
tery rattled down out of the hole. 
“We must be up into the Neo- 
lithic. Pots are used to store 



148 



GALAXY 



grain. Deliberate farmers must 
have produced a more assured 
food supply, and the rules of 
Malthusian starvation have 
eased. For the first time the pop- 
ulation is increasing rapidly, 
faster and faster. Dig!” 

When Dr. West with his flash- 
light wormed his way up the 
slanting tunnel, wheezing through 
dust, slipping on loose rocks, 
squirming past Esk children who 
had been sent up to clear bot- 
tlenecks in debris slides, strug- 
gling upward for almost a mile 
through hot dusty air which made 
him gasp, his chest tightening 
with warning heart pains, he fin- 
ally reached the buttocks of the 
Esk who was digging. 

“Move aside. Let me look.” 
Dr. West raised his flashlight to 
sun-dried yellow bricks. “Foun- 
dations. Must have been a perm- 
anent village.” 

But the bricks above were fire- 
blackened. When the Esk jabbed 
the crowbar up among them, 
crumbling bricks roared down, 
releasing a fall of compacted 
chunks of kitchen -midden against 
Dr. West. 

“This green lump contains part 
of a skull. Buried down in the 
trash of his ancestors. The 
green oxide was copper, a hel- 
met or a crown. Already we’re 
digging up through the graves 
of men more sophisticated than 
Eskimos.” 



MPhe crowbar clanged upward 
against masses of harder 
brick. “A village built upon a 
village.” 

Bricks thudded down, and Dr. 
West swept them between his 
legs, centered them rumbling 
down the tunnel. “More black- 
ened brick and charcoaled wood- 
en beams. This village had been 
raided, burned.” 

A clod of fire-darkened soil 
contained a triangular stain of 
rust. “The killers came with 
iron arrow points. We must be 
within 5,000 years of the sur- 
face. Dig! We’re only a heart- 
beat from the surface of man’s 
long evolutionary climb.” 

A clod slashed his palm. It 
contained white shards sharp as 
glass. “We’ve broken into re- 
corded history. Perhaps your 
head and shoulders are in 1,100 
B.C. among the descendants of 
the semimythical Yellow Em- 
peror. Yes, armed with civiliza- 
tion these ethnic Chinese have 
moved northward. They built 
fortifications on the future site 
of Peking.” 

The crowbar was dislodging 
masses of crumbling brick into 
the hole. “They rarely built with 
stone. After the roof beams 
burn, the protective tiles fall. 
Chinese castles dissolve in the 
rain,” he laughed. “But in 300 
B.C. the King of Yen began 
the Great Wall.” 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 



149 



A charred beam slid into the 
hole. “North China was over- 
whelmed by the Hu tribes. In 
distant Europe were they call- 
ed the Huns? Already we are 
past the time of Christ. Dig! 
Before we reach 650 A.D. the 
Grand Canal will reach Peking. 
The population is multiplying 
rapidly now. Dig!” 

In the falling debris lay a 
green, gourd-shaped vase un- 
broken, its surface appearing 
spider-web cracked. Dr. West 
gently extricated it. “Already 
we must have reached the 
1,100’s A.D. because this is a 
kuan vase, and the crackle-lines 
in the porcelain are intentional.” 

The crowbar smashed upward, 
and burned wreckage fell down. 
“Genghis Khan has taken Pe- 
king.” 

Blue and white porcelain 
shards fell like rain. “Already 
we are through the Mongols, 
and you are poking your crow- 
bar into the Ming Dynasty. We 
are less than 500 years from 
the surface.” 

Stand streamed down from a 
rodent’s tunnel. Above them 
glowed a little round hole like 
a luminous eye. “It is daylight 
up there!” 

Gently, Dr. West laid his 
hand on the shoulder of the 
Esk and took the crowbar from 
him. “I am your leader, your 
Angakok, your Mao, and only 



I have the power to break 
through to the present. Close 
your eyes. The future is blind- 
ing.” 

Dr. West thrust the crowbar 
up through the worn brick pav- 
ing of the Manchus, shouldered 
aside the thin new bricks of 
the Communists and lifted his 
head into the dazzling sunlight. 

‘ > 'T' l he long pink walls within the 
Imperial City glowed with 
sunlight. The vast paved square 
lay golden with dust. Covered 
with motionless ripples of loess 
dust, the Great Square where 
millions had paraded before 
Mao’s platform was shrouded 
with Gobi dust. 

A distant chopping sound 
made Dr. West turn his head 
uncertainly, his ears confused 
by the echoes. His low angle 
of vision, with only his head 
above the wide-spread pavement 
of the enormous square, made 
the pink walls seem to lean in- 
ward. Arches appeared too close 
or too distant. Empty brown 
flower beds along the walls 
seemed tilted like brown stripes, 
as Dr. West blinked in the 
strange perspective of the Great 
Square and arches as if his head 
had risen in a Daliesque paint- 
ing. His nervous gaze sought the 
sound. Chunk-echo! Chunk- 
echo! 

So close he had not noticed 



150 



GALAXY 



in the foreground glowed clean 
white rib cages in- the golden 
dust. In waves of dust floated 
smooth white ovals. He stared 
at the shadowed eye-holes of 
the skulls. Esks or men? 

Thousands of skeletons lay all 
around him no matter which 
way he turned his head. The 
perspective made it appear to 
him as if they lay in concen- 
tric circles, as if fallen from a 
dance pattern. He blinked his 
eyes. Close to his hand a skele- 
tal hand overlapped another’s 
hand as if — Esks or men? 

Dr. West struggled up out 
of the hole and whirled, peer- 
ing down at the smiling Esks 
in its darkness. “Stay back! The 
sun will kill you,” he lied. “My 
command is wait. Send down 
this word.” Already he could 
hear his other Esks chattering 
in the tunnel. “Until darkness, 
wait.” 

He stared at a fallen sign- 
board. The withered paint still 
extolled Mao Ill’s last Three 
Anti Campaigns : Anti-Imperial- 
ist, Anti-Revisionist, Anti-Intel- 
lectual. He dragged the flimsy 
signboard over the hole. 

From the effort of dragging 
the signboard, Dr. West swayed 
like an old man, his heart 
pounding. 

Chunk-echo! Chunk-echo. 
Turning, scanning for the chop- 
ping sound in the burning sun- 



light, he dizzied, the pink walls 
flowing past. He stopped. 

On the distant pink wall, the 
dark shape, the shadow of the 
shape, bent up and down. 
Chunk-echo! Chunk-echo. 

His throat clutching his sound- 
less shout, Dr. West ran for- 
ward. Across golden ripples of 
dust, he ran toward the pink 
wall. He saw on the brown strip 
of the bare flower bed, shadow- 
ed upon the pink wall, up and 
down, the dark figure wielding 
a hoe. 

Man or Esk? 

Startled, whirling, cornered, 
the squat figure raised its hoe 
like a weapon. 

It is a man. Dr. West thought 
as joy blurred his eyes. 

He felt his face stretching. 
Smiling senselessly as an Esk, 
Dr. West staggered toward the 
man. 

The ragged man backed 
against the pink wall. The sun- 
light glinted on his hoe’s blade. 

“We both are men,” Dr. West 
blurted in Chinese. 

| die old man shifted his 
weight. On the chopped dirt, 
with his foot, he was trying to 
conceal something behind his in- 
congrous blue tennis shoe. Dr. 
West extended his open hand, 
and the old man’s eyes slitted 
in fright, his elbows rising, the 
gleaming snake’s head of his 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 



151 



hoe ready and poised to strike. 

“It is true I am an Ameri- 
can.” Dr. West spread his open 
hands in a gesture of peace. “A 
whiteman, but you and I — 
not Esks. We are men.” 

The old man’s forehead creas- 
ed vertically as if squeezed by 
conflicting beliefs. “These seeds 
are not to be eaten. They are 
for — seeds.” 

“May your crop be ... ” Dr. 
West fumbled into his pocket 
and handed the old man what- 
ever he found there, “ — be 
fortunate.” 

Hesitantly the gnarled hand 
closed on the pencil stub. Dip- 
ping his head, the old man ab- 
ruptly lowered his hoe and 
squatted down. From a grease- 
stained knotted rag he extri- 
cated a leathery strip. Twist- 
ing it apart, he proffered the 
larger part to Dr. West. 

Solemnly the old man chewed. 

Dr. West chewed the hard- 
smoked meat, salty as tears. 
“Where are — the people?” Dr. 
West’s eyes burned. 

“Working.” The old man 
seemed surprised that the ques- 
tion had been asked. “Outside 
the walls the dirt has more 
dampness for crops.” His hand 
fingered the dry soil of what 
had been a flower bed in the 
Great Square. “But my wall 
keeps out the wind. My knees 
ache. Before the electricity 



stopped, I was a subway con- 
ductor, not a — ” 

“Whose skeletons?” Dr. West 
interrupted. 

The old man’s eyes closed, 
wrinkling, and his forehead 
wrinkled as if he had begun 
pondering a deeper question. 
“You say you are an American. 
I never truly believed that the 
Americans sent the plague. Our 
bodies, the stench in the sub- 
way — None of the Smiling 
People were sick. They cared 
for us as best they could.” 

“Then these are the skeletons 
of men?” Dr. West’s heart con- 
tracted. 

“No, Esks, of course!” The old 
man’s face showed surprise at 
Dr. West’s ignorance. 

“The Esks are dead every- 
where?” 

“I do not think they are truly 
dead. They joined hands.” The 
old man glanced at the sky. 
“The flesh has been gone from 
their bones for a season.” 

Dr. West covertly expectorat- 
ed the salty meat into his palm 
and stared at the old man’s 
leathery face. 

“Who can say who is dead. 
In this little world ...” The 
old man ruminated his salted 
meat solemnly “ . little can 
be understood. Circles like danc- 
ers. Many little circles joined to- 
gether like a net. But they did 
riot dance.” 



152 



GALAXY 



“All the skeletons are in this 
square?” 

“I think, everywhere in Pe- 
king, and in other places, all 
over the world I am told. They 
did not dance, although they 
were smiling like bridegrooms 
and brides at the sky.” The old 
man squinted upward. 

Dr. West blinked from the 
skeletons of the Esks to the 
blinding sky. “What did you see 
— up there?” 

“See? We old men know only 
the body dies. When men are 
hungry enough, meat can be 
salted, and it makes no dif- 
ference to the soul. A poor man 
like myself understands only 
how to survive on this Earth.” 

“What did you see?” Dr. West 
repeated, his voice rising. 

“They are all around us, I 
think.” The old man turned his 
weathered face. “Years ago when 
there were not so many, we call- 
ed them the Smiling People. We 
called them the Dream People. 
Perhaps they were smiling be- 
cause they were in a dream, 
and they knew what was going 
to happen. Your face is angry.” 

“I’m not angry. I want to 
know!” Dr. West’s chest pain 
was tightening. 

“Nor I.” The old man mut- 
tered, closing his gnarled knuck- 
les around the handle of his 
hoe. “After the confusion from 
lack of rations, some of us kill- 



ed Dream People. Not enough. 
Pulling out a few hairs does not 
kill the head.” 

“What did you see!” 

“It is too difficult to ex- 
plain.” The old man glanced 
sideways toward the pink arch. 
“Some day someone will repair 
the electricity. The subway cars 
will move. I will receive my ra- 
tion tickets because I was — am 
not a peasant! In my subway 
car — ” The old man stared 
past Dr. West’s shoulder to- 
ward the center of the Great 
Square. 

XX,Tith a hissing exhalation of 
* ' rage or fear, the old man 
raised his hoe and scurried out 
across the dust, running like a 
fat spider across the golden rip- 
ples of the square toward the 
dark spots emerging out of the 
pavement. 

“Oh god, they’re coming out 
of the tunnel.” Dr. West watch- 
ed his distant Esks wandering 
out into the glaring sunlight. 

As the old man’s diminishing 
silhouette reached them, his hoe’s 
blade flashed high and struck. 
One small figure staggered, 
clutching its shoulder. The old 
man struck again with the hoe, 
and another figure slumped to 
its knees. Somehow he appeared 
entangled among them, but with 
his hoe he struck down, and his 
back heaved up, but his hoe did

not rise. The old man’s small 
figure lurched away. 

Empty handed, the old man 
ran toward Dr. West, his face 
contorted. “More. Again! Re- 
turned.” His breath hissing, he 
ran past Dr. West through the 
pink arch out of the square. 

Dr. West knew the old man 
had run for help, for other men 
to help slaughter his Esks. The 
old man could not know how 
many Esks were spreading out 
of the tunnel. The consequences — 

Dr. West’s heart-pain clutch- 
ed. He stared at his Esks emerg- 
ing like lost children into the 
Great Square. Dr. West started 
toward them. 

“Go back!” he shouted. “Go 
back to the hole.” 

He tried to herd the spreading 
Esks back to the tunnel. 

You are too late, he thought 
sadly at them. Your purpose. 
“Go back!” he shouted in sud- 
den anger. You have destroyed 
my life, he thought as he push- 
ed helplessly at them. Without 
malice, you have multiplied. All 
over the world your presence has 
hastened the Malthusian forms 
of death for Man. All my adult 
life, you have confronted me 
with my inability to halt either 
your purpose or lack of pur- 
pose. He was past anger. “Please 
go back.” 

His Esks were smiling at the 
empty sky. Their hands were 



linking. On all sides of Dr. West, 
they were forming little circles of 
Esks touching other little circles 
throughout the Great Square. 
They stood waiting. 

“You are too late. Go back.” 
Dr. West glanced from the dark 
tunnel to the pink arch through 
which savage men would come. 

The wind moved. The dry air 
crackled. Dr. West thought he 
heard a humming sound. It was 
coming from them. 

“My god!” 

XI 

A 11 around Dr. West, the Esks, 
their hair standing on end. 
They were smiling upward as 
the whip-crash of lightning 
blinded Dr. West. The lightning 
rose from them. His retinas and 
the visual part of his brain re- 
tained the lightning flashing up- 
ward in a static electric dis- 
charge as he lurched in the deaf- 
ening boom of colliding air mole- 
cules refilling the gulf. In the 
prickly scent of ozone, on his 
knees he groped, his hand clos- 
ing on the soft back, the still- 
warm shoulder of an Esk wom- 
an as delicately boned as Mar- 
thalik had been so many years 
ago, and Dr. West cried out. His 
sight was returning, but he was 
afraid to look upward. 

All around him lay the fall- 
en bodies of the Esks in their 



154 



GALAXY 



dance patterns. He thought he 
heard the humming sound above 
his head. Crouched in the dust, 
instinctively he clung to the 
Earth. His eyes closed tightly as 
fists. In tightening pain his heart 
labored. 

Because he had almost seen 
the end, he thought he under- 
stood the beginning. Fifty years 
ago the huge shell had fallen 
down through the polar inbend- 
ing of the Earth’s magnetic 
lines of force, down through the 
weak inturning in the Earth’s 
ionospheric radiation belts, 
smashing down on the Boothia 
Peninsula near the North Mag- 
netic Pole. Oh god, why couldn’t 
it have fallen on the lifeless 
South Magnetic Pole? 

Are your eggs waiting at ran- 
dom through the Universe? 

He was afraid to look up as 
the humming grew inside his 
skull. His evasive mind fled 
backward. Fifty years ago a 
young Eskimo stared at the 
Burned Place, Dr. West thought 
frantically. Peterluk, yes, with 
his grimy finger he would have 
poked whatever lay within the 
inner shell. He stood too close 
to — 

Sharp heart pains reflected 
from Dr. West’s chest down the 
inside of his left arm. Momen- 
tarily his thoughts blurred as if 
something overlapped his brain. 
From the nucleus of the shell 



did a repatterning flow through 
Peterluk to his gonads? Yes, 
you altered his genetic material 
for your purpose. 

Dr. West’s face twisted in a 
tired smile as his thoughts fled 
backward in time. Peterluk’s 
fanciful explanation of the first 
Esk emerging as a fully grown 
baby-man from the splitting 
hump of a dying monster had 
been an inexplicable lie. His 
wife Eevvaalik’s explanation 
that the first Esk born was a 
month after a huge glass hypo- 
dermic repeatedly violated her, 
in artificial insemination, was 
only half a lie. 

Fes, lustful Peterluk carried 
your purpose to Eevvaalik’s 
uterus, Dr. West thought, where 
it grew more efficiently than the 
babies of our purpose. Your 
Esks had the advantage of a 
one-month gestation period and 
more rapid maturation for each 
generation until your purpose al- 
most covered my Earth. 

His hand pressing his chest, 
his momentarily easing pain. Dr. 
West smiled. Those unsophisti- 
cated Esks believed you were 
coming down for them. For them 
you become the true myth of 
power like a huge white Grand- 
father Polar Bear coming down. 

But I know your pattern al- 
ready was in them. Adaptability! 
Smiling, smiling, your Esks in- 
stinctively behaved in a non- 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 



155 



violent manner. Non-violence en- 
abled their maximum survival 
and multiplication in the pecu- 
liar environment of this parti- 
cular planet at this time. But 
your time-fuse was burning in 
them. Cued, your Esks joined 
hands in billions. In vast dance 
patterns for — who? 

Dr. West wanted to look up. 
Joining hands, he thought, Esks 
looking upward. Upward toward 
your purpose, your purpose — 

'jT'Yr. West looked up at the sky. 

" Dazzling blue, the sky was 
visually empty, but Dr. West 
was seeing sparkling representa- 
tional patterns impressed direct- 
ly in his brain. With his eyes 
there was nothing up there with 
sufficient molecular density to 
be seen. But in the visual por- 
tion of his brain he was be- 
ing communicated with — 

He understood. He was being 
shown a diagrammatic pattern 
in a brain, flowing thoughts, 
circling memories. Transmitting 
neuron cells were represented as 
strings of sparkling dots. Elec- 
tric potentials within cells dis- 
charged in sequence, symbolic 
dots blinking in succession like 
the falling of dominoes, sym- 
bolizing the flow of conscious 
thought. The essence of life. 

All around Dr. West in the 
Great Square the Esks lay dead. 
The vital electric flowings which 



had been their essence, their 
consciousness, the sum of their 
memories and experience had 
stopped — forever? Dr. West 
felt his chest tightening. 

From his memory the symbol 
for a single electron appeared. 
Surprisingly, it was trailed by 
an unknown symbol, a smaller 
dot. Like a graviton symbol 
but not graviton, it followed its 
electron as if it were a red 
balloon being pulled along a 
neuron path by an erratic elec- 
tron-child. Everywhere the lit- 
tle unknown symbols were be- 
ing towed in the brain’s flow- 
ing electrical patterns. They had 
always been there — in every 
living brain. 

Dr. West cried out from the 
pain in his chest. He felt that 
abstract brain dying. He saw 
the vital differences in electron 
potentials of neurons leaking 
across like water until level and 
in stasis. Unconsciousness. No 
electron flow. If there had been 
an electroencephalographic ma- 
chine available, it would have 
graphed this brain as clinically 
dead. 

But the diagrammatic skele- 
ton of what had been the brain’s 
essence still was outlined in in- 
tricate, motionless patterns held 
by the unknown dot-symbols. 
No longer flowing, these un- 
known symbols suddenly rose 
in unison. They had been thrust 



156 



GALAXY 



free from the energy bonds of 
their neutralizing electrons. With 
artistic freedom, each rising dot 
was marked with a tiny plus 
sign, symbolizing a small posi- 
tive charge. 

From the center of the Earth, 
against each unknown dot was 
thrust a gravity symbol, a gravi- 
ton also wearing an arbitrary 
plus sign. Like charges repel, 
Dr. West thought wryly, in- 
tense pain returning to his chest. 

As in a demonstration of sta- 
tic electric force, which this was 
not, the positively marked grav- 
itons from the Earth, as sure- 
ly as friction-charged black rub- 
ber combs, repelled the positive- 
ly charged dot-symbols upward. 
Out of the brain, perhaps of a 
dead Esk, rose the whole intri- 
cate pattern of consciousness 
and memory still outlined in the 
unknown dot-symbols. Dr. West 
was shown the individual pat- 
tern spreading as its massless 
dot-symbols skipped upward 
upon their temporary molecular 
perches in tire air, spreading up 
among the thinning molecules 
of the atmosphere. 

In the thinning air of the stra- 
tosphere, the unknown dot- 
symbols still maintained the 
shape of the man’s mentality 
although the diameter of the 
brain pattern had expanded to 
hundreds of yards in order to 
find enough temporary molecu- 



lar attachments for all of its 
dots. Still repelled outward by 
the diminishing force of gravity 
from tiie Earth, the Esk’s brain 
pattern was spreading over the 
sparse molecules in the near- 
vacuum beyond the Moon. Now 
the brain pattern was being 
driven out of the solar system 
by the gravitational force from 
the sun, out into the hard va- 
cuum between the stars where 
each Esks mind pattern was 
expanding larger than a planet. 

“Are they still alive?” Dr. 
West cried aloud. “Are they con- 
scious?” 

I n his chest, in his mind he was 
given the feeling of pressure 
of billions of Esks’ patterns like 
invisible balloons packed to- 
gether by their individual ex- 
pansions. Still surrounding the 
Earth and the solar system, they 
were pressing outward in every 
direction into the blackness of 
space. Toward the gravitation- 
less void between two distant 
stars the outermost patterns 
were expanding toward — shud- 
dering, Dr. West’s heart ham- 
mered with excitement — to- 
ward an immense waiting ex- 
trusion from another group-pat- 
tern stretching in vast light- 
years across the galaxy. 

Already, hours, days, weeks, 
months ago, after the other Esks 
had died on every continent of 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 



157 



the Earth, the edge of the Esks’ 
group pattern must have reach- 
ed' this greater group; and Dr. 
West understood from whence 
his mind-pictures had been trans- 
mitted. 

His awareness was lifted 
through the blackness and daz- 
zle of space. As if overwhelmed 
in a psychogenic journey, he 
soared outward toward the rim 
of the galaxy. Through myriad 
asteroids of shattered outer 
planets, he fell past mountainous 
space-rocks dotted with white 
domes. Like colossal barnacles, 
the lime-white domes extended 
green nets, but not to trap 
planktonic life in space. He saw 
those weightless green nets more 
widespread than football sta- 
diums turning to- trap the ra- 
diant energy from the yellow 
sun below. 

He fell past the dotted aster- 
oids, their rack-digesting, white 
domes expelling white eggs. With 
unfolding purple fringes, the 
huge organic-stone eggs drifted 
away from the pressure of the 
strange sun’s light, their pur- 
ple sails diminishing into the 
blackness. Its fleshy fringe burn- 
ed off, he thought, as it fell 
through our atmosphere. 

He was falling toward the 
third planet. The planet was 
brown and dead. 

For him, the picturization 
spun backward in time, and the 



planet became green and dense- 
ly populated. Slender and with 
a seemingly infinite variety of 
specialized organs, nevertheless 
they were all of one species, 
capable of skilled psionic elec- 
tron-adjustments of the genes of 
their unborn. He felt the fright- 
ened thoughts of a varied pop- 
ulation rich in telepathic empa- 
thy. They had achieved gentle 
social control of themselves. But 
they had not achieved space 
flight. Their evolutionary climb 
was trapped on their single plan- 
et when the viral catastrophe ex- 
terminated them. All together 
they died. Their bodies had de- 
composed brown on their brown 
planet. 

Their stylized brain patterns 
rose across Dr. West’s inner 
vision, expanding out through 
their solar system past minimum 
gravity asteroids into the empti- 
ness of space. His heart strug- 
gled with nervous expectation 
of a miracle, but then he saw 
that their patterns, like the pat- 
terns of the Esks, were rising 
in nonconscious death. 

As in the brain patterns of 
the Esks, the only movement 
was the spreading apart of dot- 
symbols as each pattern ex- 
panded in space. Like the dead 
bones of skeletons, their dot- 
symbol patterns still retained the 
outlines of their neuron path- 
ways — and did not flow. Dr. 



158 



GALAXY 



West saw the dot-symbols did 
not change position relative to 
each other within a pattern. 
There was no dot circulation, no 
consciousness, no energy. Like 
the mental patterns of the Esks 
and of everything that had ever 
died, in their billions these pat- 
terns were expanding outward 
through the universe in eternal 
death. 

But we are alive! 

t\r. West felt their crowded 
patterns pressing against 
each other, each lacking inter- 
nal circulation and conscious- 
ness. In their vast numbers they 
were receiving more and more 
pressure because the sum of 
their individual expansion rates 
was greater-faster than the ex- 
pansion of the outer edges of 
their whole group. Out into 
space there must be a limiting 
velocity for the massless dot- 
symbols, perhaps related to the 
sparseness of molecular attach- 
ments. 

Within the vast group, he felt 
individual patterns squeezing 
against one another in more 
and more vital contact. They 
vibrated wherever their outer- 
most dot-symbols momentarily 
attached to the same molecules. 
But there was no overlapping of 
brain patterns, even though ex- 
terior pressure from the distant 
gravitational fields of other stars 



was increasing as the outer edges 
of the group expanded closer to 
these gravity solar systems. By 
now, Dr. West knew the group 
must be many light-years in 
diameter, and it contained no 
consciousness. 

The glowing dots of one sym- 
bolic brain pattern emblazoned 
on his brain. He saw that its un- 
known dot-symbols still did not 
flow as in a living brain. Yet 
he understood that the sur- 
rounding pressures had reached 
their absorption limit. Further 
pressure had nowhere to go but 
into energy. The energy was sub- 
limated in motion of the dots 
within the individual patterns. 
Bead-strings of dots were be- 
ginning to flow. Along familiar 
pathways, which had been neur- 
ons in the living brain, moved 
the dots of consciousness. In 
the "vacuum there was little re- 
sistance to their quanta-skip, 
and the dots moved faster and 
faster, energized by the tempor- 
ary pressures. We are alive! 

Dr. West’s erratic heart strug- 
gled with excitement. Another 
massive pain cramped his blood- 
starving heart muscle. As if per- 
sonally defeated, he saw ines- 
capable unconsciousness and 
death awaiting the expanding 
group in the infinite emptiness 
of space. 

He understood their fatal 
problem. As they spread out 



THE PURPOSE OF LIFE 



159 



between the stars along the gulfs 
of least gravitational pressure, 
the group’s expanding outer 
edges were relieving the vital 
pressure. Within the group, the 
life-giving pressure could only 
decline. The number in the 
group was finite. Space seemed 
infinite. 

Their massless brain patterns 
could not reproduce themselves. 
Their own numbers could not 
increase, and their individual ex- 
pansion rates were slowing to- 
ward their limits. Pressure-ener- 
gy was lessening. Even though 
the brain patterns of recently 
dead creatures throughout the 
galaxy were being swept up 
and by inertia packing against 
the outside of the expanding 
group, the pressure within was 
declining. Within the individual 
patterns of thought, the dots 
moved more slowly. Death was 
returning. 

XI 

XTow Dr. West understood the 
purposes of the Esks in the 
larger purpose. He understood 
the importance of dying in bil- 
lions at one time. 

Striving for immortality, the 
larger group could not repro- 
duce themselves. Nor could they 
reach in and kill the life forms 
on a billion planets. Gravity 
kept them away. 



In his mind, he was shown 
again an insensible white dome 
feeding on its rocky asteroid. In 
this minimum gravity the pres- 
sure within the group was great- 
er than the weakly repelling gra- 
viton quanta projected from the 
asteroid. A mind pattern was 
able to overlap the fleshy nuc- 
leus in a dome. The widespread 
pattern concentrated a node of 
flowing dots within the leathery 
tube of reproduction in the 
dome. Symbolized dots attached 
themselves by their weak “bal- 
loon strings” to electrons with- 
in the genetic flesh-batteries 
within a forming lime-white egg 
within the dome. 

In time, the egg was expelled 
as always into drifting space. 

For Dr. West, time was shift- 
ed in his direction. Genetically 
altered eggs on lucky collision 
courses smashed against bare as- 
teroids as they always had. New 
domes grew and emitted new 
eggs with unnatural haste. As 
always, eggs bumped in space, 
exchanging electrical imprints of 
their genetic material. In the 
past, purple-fringed eggs, sail- 
ing by light pressure through 
space, had steered away in ne- 
gative reaction to gravitational 
fields of intensity. Their domes 
only would grow on airless aster- 
oids of low gravity. 

But now some genetically al- 
tered eggs steered toward gravi- 



160 



GALAXY 



ty forces, toward stars and then 
away from these blazing suns 
when radiation stabbed with 
unbearable intensity through 
their fleshy nuclei. 

Down toward a billion plan- 
ets the aberrant eggs plunged, 
now attracted by gravity but at 
the last moment repelled by the 
radiation belts around gravity 
planets. Readjusting their sun- 
sails, deflected, they streaked on 
orbiting courses above the radia- 
tion belts held by the planets’ 
magnetic lines of force. 

Down through the weak fun- 
nel in Earth’s radiation belts, 
down through the inward turn- 
ing of the Earth’s magnetic lines 
of force, the egg had plunged 
toward the North Magnetic Pole. 
Its fleshy sun-sail burning in the 
atmosphere, the egg smashed 
down on the Boothia Peninsula. 
With a puzzled smile, Dr. West 
watched Peterluk poking the 
fleshy nucleus with his finger. 

There could be no pattern of 
unknown symbols waiting to in- 
vade Peterluk’s genes. The 
Earth’s gravitons would have 
driven them out while the egg 
was still above the ionosphere. 
Within the egg’s altered nucleus 
of electrogenetic material, a 
generalized electron-pattern was 
waiting. Since the domes are 
stationary on their asteroids, it 
is only through their drifting 
eggs that genetic imprints are 



exchanged with electric jolts. 

He felt Peterluk’s surprise and 
chagrin to find himself lying on 
his back on the cold rocks of 
the Burned Place. Frightened, 
Peterluk did not confess this un- 
explainably evil fainting weak- 
ness to Eevvaalik that night 
when he seized her in his arms. 
In the rhythmically gasping 
darkness, of the millions of his 
sperm the successful one to pen- 
etrate her ovuum carried the 
altered chromosomes. These 
transmitted merely the generaliz- 
ed characteristics of adaptabili- 
ty, fetal growth efficiency, a 
one-month gestation period, an 
increasing maturation rate, more 
and more rapid multiplication 
— and an unlit fuse. 

Future population pressure 
and other cues could ignite it. 
Joining hands in death, the Esks 
had fallen, their freed patterns 
ballooning into space. Too well, 
Dr. West understood the pur- 
pose for which the Esks had — 
died. 

But they are alive! They are 
becoming alive! The great 
thoughts surged in Dr. West’s 
brain. We — they — every-

D r. West felt their hope and 
excitement as he lay in the 
golden dust of the Great Square, 
his contorted body gasping for 
breath. The massive pain from 
his 'heart so filled his chest that 
the pain seemed to be squeez- 
ing him out of himself.

pattern increases the vital pres-

Life can be sustained for all be-

ing was sympathy. Excitement. 
Hope.

knew he should try to reach

for the bottle of nitro. It might 
not be too late to take a pill. 
His thoughts were dimming. He 
felt enveloping sympathy. Sur-

thoughts of those beyond to him 
— with sympathy. Why else 
would he have been communi- 
cated with in this last possible 
moment as the last expanding 
patterns of the Esks crowded 
upward from the Great Square 
in continuous contact across 
space — 

Twisting on his side, his 
breathless body contracted in a 
fetal position, and he glimpsed 
the blue sky so beautiful. He 
laughed like a naked savage 
with wonder and awe, but 
soundlessly. He laughed as his 
heart’s terminal fibrillations stag- 
nated the flow of blood to his 
brain into visual darkness, and 
he did not take the pill. 

Freed from life-long fear he 
laughed with amazement at the 
Universe of which he was a 
part. 

His last human thoughts wan- 
dered above the bodies of the 
Esks in the Great Square. He 
imagined a sharply questioning

GALAXY 



WITHIN THE CLOUD 

by PIERS ANTHONY 



The clouds were lovely , 
graceful and — dangerous! 



64T>di eve me, this is not a joke,” 
the portly tourist said. He 
was careful to face the man as he 
spoke. 

“We think you can help us, and 
my wife won’t give me any peace 
until — Anyway, all you have to 
do is look at a few seconds of 
film. Twenty dollars for your 
trouble, even if you can’t make 
anything of it.” 

The man nodded. He led the 
way to an empty classroom and 
set up a projector and screen, 
while the woman waited anxious- 
ly- 

The projector started and stop- 
ped. The man grunted and un- 
screwed the lamp, showing them 
that it had blown. He signaled 
them to remain and stepped into 
the hall. 

“This is eerie,” the woman said. 
She was perhaps ten years young- 
er than her husband, quite pretty, 



but temperamental. “Who would 
have thought we’d wind up visit- 
ing a school for deaf-mutes on 
our vacation!” 

“Well, you started it,” the tour- 
ist said. “You and that hyper- 
active imagination.” 

“I started it!” she exclaimed 
indignantly. 

“Don’t you remember? That 
afternoon on the beach. All I 
wanted was to get some tan on 
my back, but you kept chatter- 
ing about clouds — ” 

66T like clouds,” she said. 

“They’re so free, and they 
take so many shapes. No one 
tells them what to do; no one 
grouches at them.” She nudged 
her husband playfully. “If I were 
a Confucian, I’d reincarnate as a 
cloud, and — ” 

“Buddhist.” 

“Anyway, I’d be a cloud and 



163 



just float along without a care 
in the world, free free free free!” 

“The Buddhists and Hindus 
believe in reincarnation,” he said, 
“but I’m not sure a cloud was 
their idea of Nirvana.” 

“Free free free free!” she re- 
peated. “Why are you always so 
serious? You have no sense of 
humor at all.” 

“You wouldn’t appreciate my 
humor,” he said. 

“Now look at that cloud right 
over us. See — it’s almost like a 
face, looking down at us.” She 
nudged him. 

He rolled over in the warm 
sand, squinting up. 

“See,” she repeated urgently. 
“Two ears at the sides, two sor- 
rowful dark eyes, a long thunder- 
some nose — ” 

“ — and a big, ugly, volumin- 
ous, gassy mouth,” he agreed ir- 
ritably. “Wide open.” 

“Half open.” 

“You talk more than you look. 
That’s a perfect ‘O’.” 

She studied the cloud more 
carefully. “Well, it was half open. 
If you’d looked when I told you 
the first time.” 

“Uh-huh.” He squeezed her 
tanned knee comfortably and 
closed his eyes. 

“Now it’s shut again.” 

He rolled over, not looking. 
“Why don’t you make up your 
»* 

“No, really. It opened and 

164 



closed. I’m sure. Well, I think. ' 
“Yep.” 

“Now it’s opening again.” 

“Is it winking, too?” 

“Now you’re being — ” 

“A kind of cosmic Peeping 
Tom, staring down your bikini.” 
She shut up, hurt. 

He reached out, but she slid 
out of reach. “Aw, now, I’m sor- 
ry. I said you wouldn’t appreciate 
my — I’m sorry. Look, I’ll go get 
my time-delay camera and make 
a series for you. Then there’ll be 
no question.” 

She was magically within reach 
again. In a little while he lum- 
bered up, shook off loose sand 
and headed for the car to fetch 
the camera. 

T he mute returned with a fresh 
bulb and set the film in mo- 
tion. There were a few ordinary 
flashes of the beach and waves 
and the controversial bikini ; then 
the series on the cloud. Focus 
and resolution were excellent; the 
tourist knew how to use his cam- 
era. 

The sequence itself was brief. 
Fifteen minutes had been reduced 
to five seconds, but this too had 
been expertly handled. The cloud 
was revealed as an animated, ex- 
pressive face, its mouth opening 
and closing in apparent speech. 
All that was missing was the 
sound. 

“You see?” she said. “You see, 

GALAXY 



you see — that cloud was speak- 
ing to me! Maybe its a new form 
of life, like the Saucers — ” 

“UFO’s.” 

“ — or something. Maybe we 
just never knew where to look for 
it before.” 

“A cloud? A common cumulus 
humilis!” They had obviously 
been over this many times. 

“Maybe it’s an alien observer 
telling us the secrets of the uni- 
verse!” She could not sit still. 

“In faultless English with a 
slight Boston accent,” the tourist 
growled, but his wife missed the 
irony. He turned to the mute. 
“Here is your money. What did 
you make of it?” 

The man looked at him stead- 
ily with an indefinable expression,' 
then handed him the rewound 
film and a written note. 

“This is what it said?” the 
tourist demanded, not looking at 
the paper. “You read the lips? 
You’re sure?” 

The mute nodded once em- 
phatically, then smiled briefly 
and stepped into the hall. 



T he girl snatched the papei 
and unfolded it with trem- 
bling hands. Then wrath over- 
came her prettiness. She crumpled 
the note, threw it down, and 
stalked out. 

The tourist retrieved the paper, 
spread it out and read it at a 
glance. His belly shook and his 
cheeks puffed out with sup- 
pressed laughter. 

“I like that alien!” he mur- 
mured. “I suppose our dialogue 
is pretty funny, from that eleva- 
tion.” Then he too threw the 
paper aside and followed his wife, 
smiling. 

“Free free free free!” he mim- 
icked and choked over his mirth 
again. 

The paper remained on the 
floor, its six printed words reveal- 
ing more about clouds than the 
meteorologists would ever com- 
prehend :

WITHIN THE CLOUD 165 




'Tphere is no school of science 
-*• fiction less in the public 
awareness today than the one 
formerly sustained in Chicago. 

The Chicago magazines exist- 
ed as an island apart from the 
plenitude of the East Coast, con- 
nected to the Main only by the 
most slender bridges, sustaining 
their own corpus of headliners, 
aspirants and friends of the 
management. Most of the local 
writers were people you never 
heard of, and most of them are 
better left that way. Essential- 
ly they have all left science fic- 
tion now, along with the entire 
collateral establishment of edi- 
tors and illustrators except Vir- 
gil Finlay. Only the oldest and 
most widely separated segments 
of Chicago fandom still contain 
some people who not only share 
its memory but, more important, 
were in at the antediluvian wat- 
ering of its roots. 

It’s all legends now, and a 



yellowing mausoleum of mostly 
trash. This is no evocation of 
nostalgia; it’s an illustration that 
there are, or there once were, 
other systematic ways of looking 
at this field. It was Carthage, 
it is gone, the law of Rome runs 
now without hindrance, but still 
the ruins poke up through the 
salt-sown earth. 

Great Science Fiction Stories 
About Mars (Frederick Fell, 
$3.95), is edited by T. E. Dikty, 
a man from Chicago. An old 
hand in town, he has been editor 
or co-editor of at least eighteen 
science-fiction anthologies. Be- 
ginning in 1949 and continuing 
through 1956 at least, he par- 
ticipated in or directed the edit- 
ing of a series of annual “Best” 
collections which ultimately lost 
out when Judith Merril came 
along. 

This book contains the fol- 
lowing stories: “The Sound of 



166 



Bugles,” by Robert Moore Wil- 
liams; ‘‘Nonstop to Mars,” by 
Jack Williamson; A. E. Van 
Vogt’s “The First Martians,” 
Eando Binder’s “Via Etherline,” 
“Tin Lizzie,” by Randall Gar- 
rett; “Under the Sand-Seas,” by 
Oliver E. Saari and H. Beam 
Piper’s “Omnilingual.” It also 
has an introduction and a good 
table of physical comparisons 
between Earth and Mars. 

Now you’ll have noticed some- 
thing, I think; it’s not often that 
a man given an opportunity to 
put together a book of seven 
science-fiction stories will include 
Binder, Williams and Saari. 
A. E. Van Vogt has not been a 
top-line writer in the world’s 
estimation for many years now. 
Jack Williamson’s luster — 
again, we’re talking about the 
public eye, and names that 
bookstore owners might con- 
ceivably recognize — is that of 
fine antique silver. H. Beam Pi- 
per was a very good workman 
but never developed a by-line 
that sold books. And Randall 
Garrett, a man of passionate 
personal involvement with the 
universe, long ago taught him- 
self to write in a manner that 
would never betray this fact to 
the public. 

This is not, in other words, a 
smart book. It seems to be, only, 
a book that Ted Dikty would 
have liked to read. Oddly 



enough, I expect you will enjoy 
it too. 

William’s “The Sound of Bu- 
gles” is a pretty bad pulp story. 
But Jack Williamson’s “Nonstop 
to Mars,” while one hundred per 
cent ridiculous, swings. Publish- 
ed in 1937, it concerns a dare- 
devil endurance flyer who flies 
his airplane to Mars along the 
whirlpool of air being sucked 
away from Earth by the inimi- 
cal aliens. Once there, the hero 
takes about ten seconds to set 
the whole thing on fire, kill all 
the critters, and save the world. 
It is to laugh; nevertheless, it’s 
a great and effective story. Al- 
though the relationship between 
the hero and the girl is modeled 
exactly on the poses struck by 
people in Frank R. Paul illus- 
trations, the events in which 
they are involved, and the 
breathtaking rapidity with which 
they unfold in logical sequence, 
really do evoke a sense of won- 
der. 

A. E. Van Vogt’s “The First 
Martians” is surprisingly coher- 
ent and, as a 1951 story, may 
have been one of the first places 
where it was suggested that An- 
dean Indians would make pretty 
good Martians. 

“Via Earthline” is ostensibly a 
series of radio messages from 
the first Martian expedition back 
to Earth, written as if from a 
pile of flimsies on a copydesk 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



167 



spike. It partakes of the ro- 
mance inherent in any series of 
messages from a remote outpost. 
A bunch of people go and have 
a bunch of trouble, and the last 
message tells us some of them 
are dead, with the others very 
likely about to die. Because the 
radio link — pardon me, the 
etherline link — between Earth 
and Mars is attenuating, we will 
probably never know what hap- 
pened. It’s what I guess you 
have to call a tour de force, since 
it fits no definition for being a 
story. But, again, as with the 
Williamson — though nowhere 
near as much — the reader gets 
the feeling of involvement with 
these in fact nonexistent people 
in this arbitrary place. 

“Under the Sand-Seas” is by 
a Midwest fan who, circa 1940, 
wrote and had published a fair 
number of stories without really 
attempting to make a career of 
writing. But Saari’s influence on 
such writers as Frank M. Rob- 
inson, Wilson Tucker, and a 
number of others was rather 
great by their own testimony. 

The story is a display of ideas, 
and though it may not have 
been intended as such, it’s a 
series of nudges to the kind of 
mind that writes science fiction. 
You’re going to have to excuse 
me from guessing how it will 
read to someone who simply 
reads the stuff for pleasure. He 



may find, as he probably found 
in “The First Martians,” that 
the most important idea in this 
1940 story is old-hat. It got that 
way in 1946. 

Finally we have “Tin Lizzie” 
and “Omnilingual,” both of 
which treat Mars as the locale 
for a fascinating technical puz- 
zle. In the one case, having to 
do with the chemistry of Gar- 
rett’s postulated Mars, and in 
the other, with the Rosetta 
Stone inherent in the workings 
of any technological civilization. 
The Piper, in fact, probably 
represents a genuine contribution 
to the real world. I don’t know 
that you really could begin a 
translation of an alien dead 
language by analyzing its nota- 
tion of the periodic table, but 
it sounds like a perfectly valid 
proposition, and I think archeo- 
logists ought to keep this no- 
tation on file. Readers of this 
book, meanwhile, will find these 
last two stories solidly repre- 
sentative of the kind of pack- 
age-unwrapping tale Astounding 
was always sure to publish. And 
almost as much about an arbi- 
trary place, called “Mars,” as 
the Binder story. 

On the face of it, this looks 
like yet another in Frederick 
Fell’s long series of mediocrities. 
You may be rather surprised at 
how much pleasure you get out 
of this mediocre book.

It seems to be a fact a man 
like Dikty, who knows his work, 
will turn out good work no 
matter what kind of work he 
does. Bleached-oak modern it 
ain’t. But it’s solid, it’s well con- 
sidered on its own terms and it 
may even last. 

Earthmen and Strangers, edit- 
ed by Robert Silverberg, (Duell, 
Sloan & Pearce, $3.95) is a 
theme anthology, as you might 
guess, about contact between 
Earthmen and aliens. 

The contents are comprised by 
“Dear Devil,” bjr Eric Frank 
Russell, ‘‘The Best Policy,” by 
Randall Garrett; Robert Silver- 
berg’s own “Allaree,” Poul An- 
derson’s ‘‘Life Cycle,” “The 
Gentle Vultures,” by Isaac Asi- 
mov; “Stranger Station,” by Da- 
mon Knight, Algis Budry’s 
“Lower Than Angels,” “Blind 
Lightning,” by Harlan Ellison, 
and, finally, “Out of the Sun,” 
by Arthur C. Clarke. There is 
also an introduction which seems 
to be addressed to people in 
their late teens or early twenties. 
It’s a didactic book, showing 
us that science fiction teaches 
lessons and is concerned with 
social problems. By so showing 
us, it apparently endeavors to 
so teach its reader. 

There isn’t a top-grade story 
in this book, with the exception 
of “Dear Devil” and, possibly, 



Knight’s “Stranger Station.” 
Most of them are pretty straight- 
forward, reasonably competent 
stories. They share a tendency to 
get rather emotional at times, as 
distinguished from being emo- 
tion-provoking — which is hard- 
er. At least, I’d say that about 
my own story, and if I’d say 
it, who wouldn’t?” 

“Dear Devil” is one of Rus- 
sell’s rare serious stories. It’s an 
unfortunate characteristic of the 
things that have happened to 
this writer that he rarely takes 
himself seriously anymore and 
thus substitutes the flip remark, 
and the anecdote, for the strait- 
ly-told story. But “Dear Devil” 
is about a Martian poet who 
strands himself on a devastated 
Earth so that he may empathize 
with the survivors of a nuclear 
disaster and a plague. Practical- 
ly all these survivors are chil- 
dren. The Martian is blue, ten- 
tacular, not possessed of such 
human faculties as a voice or 
laughter. The children are un- 
educated, unsupervised, and 
overwhelmingly conscious that 
they have been born into a place 
that’s hideously wrong. Both the 
Martian and the kids make it. 
It’s a very good story. When I 
think of the many, many ways 
it could have gone wrong, it’s 
a great story. 

“The Best Policy” is Randall 
Garrett writing a story that be- 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



169 



gins: “Thagobar Larnimusculus 
Verf, Borgax of Fenigwisnok, 
had a long name and an im- 
portant title ...” You run 
across something like that and 
you know it’s going to be an- 
other story about an alien be- 
ing which charges full tilt into 
conflict with an Earthman and 
will inevitably get its tentacles 
pinned back. 

“Allaree’ by Robert Silver- 
berg is about the effect of a 
chance visit by Earthmen on 
a world inhabited by intelligent 
beings who happen to all be 
part of a single, pathically link- 
ed group entity. The Earthmen 
teach one of the segments of 
the identity to be an individual 
and take him away with them. 
The new individual likes the 
whole idea at first, but can’t 
continue to live without shar- 
ing, so he dies. “Call it — mal- 
nutrition," the author says. Yes, 
and as far as it goes it’s a mean- 
ingful statement. 

“Life Cycle” is about some 
old tricky biology on Mercury, 
wrapped in the old plot about 
how the Earthmen will die if 
they don’t solve this scientific 
puzzle. Solve it they do, live 
they do, and entertain the story 
probably does. But I worry that 
all over the galaxy, Earthman 
after Earthman is getting into 
trouble of one kind or another 
and having to decipher the en- 



tire ecology of a planet before 
he can figure out how to get his 
foot out of the gum we found it 
planted in on Page One. 

What I mean by this is I’m 
noticing the persistence of this 
school of sf writing, a hang- 
over from the days when most 
good science fiction was writ- 
ten almost exclusively for en- 
gineers and other technological 
types. Is part of Anderson try- 
ing to be the John Dickson Carr 
of sf? Is that bad? you ask. 
John Dickson Carr inspires my 
admiration as a technician and 
bores me stiff, I reply. 

“The Gentle Vultures” is a 
story about aliens who are wait- 
ing for the nuclear war that 
will render Earth helpless. In 
the alien’s long experiences, no 
civilization which discovers 
atomic bombs fails to have nu- 
clear war, and their policy has 
been to never fail to move in 
and pick up the pieces while 
being as humane as possible 
to the native survivors. It is 
itself a gentle story, told by 
a gentle man, and it reflects 
the kind of mind that winces 
each time it encounters any one 
of the thousand affronts it inev- 
itably notices in the course of 
any given day. But Asimov 
writes this story as if it suf- 
ficed to say: “Here it is, I have 
shown it to you.” This is not 
quite enough. For the reader is 



170 



GALAXY 



very liable to say: “True. Too 
true. Now what?” 

“Stranger Station” by Damon 
Knight has all the things in it 
that Damon brings to his best 
stories. It has contact with the 
truly strange; in this case, an 
alien being who is overwhelming- 
ly alien, met in loneliness by one 
introspective, lonely man. His 
intermediary in contacting the 
alien is a self-aware cybernetic 
device called the Alpha Net- 
work, and in successive layers 
you discover that “contact 
with the alien” consists of con- 
tact not only with the extrater- 
restial being, and with the Al- 
pha Network, but also with 
what goes on in the back of 
the human hero’s mind. We 
are all strangers, to ourselves as 
well as to each other, and we 
journey from milepost to mile- 
post, each time thinking we see 
our destination, each time dis- 
covering that we are merely 
touching the next base. Will 
we ever score? Well, that’s the 
natural question, but for it this 
story has no answer. 

Neither does “Lower Than 
Angels.” That was always what 
bothered me about the story, 
and it continues to do so. 

Harlan Ellison’s “Blind Light- 
ning” is, as usual, an unflagging 
assault by the author on the 
characters and the readers. How- 
ever, there are times when what 



Ellison has to say outweighs his 
unwillingness to do anything 
with the reader but attack him. 
This seems to be one of those 
times. It’s actually a simple 
story about a human being 
transferring human hope to an 
essentially stupid and brutish 
alien aborigine. Somewhere in 
this welter of exclamation points 
and ripping flesh there’s a raw 
sense of something conveyed 
from human to alien, and from 
author to reader. 

Finally we have “Out of the 
Sun” by Arthur C. Clarke, who 
is more than commonly vulner- 
able to the English disease of 
threatening the entire world with 
extinction at the drop of a twin- 
kle. Clarke uses his scientific 
training to justify such postu- 
lations as intelligent life at the 
center of the earth, or intelli- 
gent life in this case inhabiting 
the Sun. Having explained to 
'us how this particular life form 
could exist, he then tells how it 
could kill us all, and concludes 
his short story. 

If you signed anybody else’s 
name to this story, you would 
get it back from the editor with 
a request for a rewrite. It would 
be an interested and intrigued 
letter of query to the author, 
and it would contain at least one 
compliment to the author’s abili- 
ty to write, as well as to imag- 
ine. But it would most definite- 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



171 



ly be a request for a rewrite, 
so as to make this light specula- 
tion a story. 

So what this book is — and 
it is graced not only with an 
intelligent introduction, but with 
perceptive notes at the head of 
each story — is another book in- 
tended to show the reader how 
intelligent science-fiction writ- 
ers are, how soulful they are 
and how full of very good ideas 
science fiction is. 

It is intended to show this, 
of course, in terms the begin- 
ning reader will already un- 
derstand. Therefore, it does not 
display intelligence, soul or 
goodness in any of the ways 
in which science fiction, and 
science fiction alone, might dis- 
play them. It displays them in 
terms of what the reader already 
knows. 

This seems a fairly simple 
point to me: You, are not go- 
ing to interest people in what 
they already know. This book 
seems to me a compilation of 
precisely the kind of story that 
makes otherwise intelligent peo- 
ple sneer at the field, or much 
worse, grant it a certain thought- 
fulness, and at the same time 
recognize how shallow it seems 
to be. 

Larry Niven is one of the 
most promising new writers 
around. Snappy, ingenious and 



upbeat, World of Ptavvs (Bal- 
lantine) is the story of Kzanol 
the thrint, who thinks he has 
successfully evaded the disas- 
ter to his starship, and further- 
more will be able to make 
ptavvs of all Earthmen. It’s also 
the story of Larry Greenberg, 
whose mistake is less complex; 
he merely thinks he’s Kzanol. 

This all comes about because 
thrints, who flit about space and 
know they are superior to all 
other life forms, acquire status 
by acquiring ptavvs; that is, 
slaves that will, under the 
thrint’s direction, help him ex- 
ploit their own planet and any- 
thing else he can grab off. 
Thrints are also sufficiently in- 
genious so as to have stasis- 
suits available for times of dis- 
aster. This protective clothing 
it not only completely imper- 
vious to outside forces but per- 
mits the wearer to go into sus- 
pended animation indefinitely. 
Finally, Larry Greenberg of 
Earth is a rudimentary telepath, 
assigned to a dolphin-commun- 
ication program here, who gets 
drafted into an ill-advised at- 
tempt to study Kzanol via an 
Earth-made machine which has 
an unfortunate effect on Kzan- 
ol’s stasis-suit. , 

What happens is that Kzanol’s 
personality becomes superim- 
posed on Greenberg’s. But since 
Greenberg comes out of the pre- 



172 



GALAXY 



cipitating contact in better im- 
mediate shape than Kzanol does, 
it is Greenberg/Kzanol who goes 
out in the full conviction that 
he is a thrint with . the whole 
world spread out waiting before 
him and proceeds to try to 
conquer the Solar System. All 
sorts of people set off in pur- 
suit of him, including, finally, 
the somewhat baffled and justi- 
fiably angry Kzanol/Kzanol. 

This is nice thinking. There 
have been very few stories which 
treat telepathy as the pheno- 
menon it should logically be. 
Most mind-reading as described 
in science fiction sounds a lit- 
tle bit like another of the Bell 
System’s services. 

It’s also, and not very by the 
way, a masterful technical de- 
vice for telling a story. In- 
stinctively masterful, further- 
more. Niven, in other places, be- 
trays the fact that he still has 
a few things left to learn about 
conscious craftsmanship. Which 
makes his innate talent all the 
more impressive at this stage of 
his career. 



Devoted readers of the late 
E. E. Smith will be delighted 
to learn of the appearance of 
The Universes of E. E. Smith, 
edited by Ron Ellik and Bill 
Evans (Advent: Publishers, P.O. 
Box 9228, Chicago, Illinois 
60690, $6.00). This is a concor- 
dance to the major writings of 
the late Doc Smith, with an 
introduction by James H. 
Schmitz, a bibliography by A1 
Lewis, and, unfortunately, illus- 
trations by Bjo. For its in- 
tended purpose, it’s not only 
a good but an invaluable book. 
If there’s anything you want 
to know about the universe in 
which the Lensman stories are 
set or the milieu of the Skylark 
stories, or if there’s anything 
you want to know about where 
these stories may be found, and 
in what forms, this is the guide 
for you. Once again Advent has 
justified its existence as a ser- 
vice to fandom. 

I think the price is too low.

BALLENGER’S PEOPLE 



by KRIS NEVILLE 



Ballenger wasn't crazy. He only 
followed simple majority rule! 



r | 'he radios in the wall came 
on with a click, and a mo- 
ment later African drum music 
issued into the bedroom. Bart 
Ballenger was instantly awake. 

He took a vote, and the con- 
sensus was it’s Thursday. 

He arose and stood before 
the window and breathed deep- 
ly. Thursday was the day to 
settle accounts with a lawyer 
on Wilshire Blvd. 

Air and sunlight said spring. 
This, too, was verified demo- 
cratically. 

Ballenger completed the early 
morning routine against the 
sound of music. He moved about 
his two-bedroom apartment, 
checking. All was as the pre- 
vious evening. No one had en- 
tered during the night. The 
smaller bedroom was in order 
against the arrival of guests who 
never came. 



He sat at the counter-top di- 
vider, between living room and 
kitchen, eating eggs, drinking 
coffee. The radios around him, 
all switched on, played the same 
music as in the bedroom. He 
bobbed his head to the rhythm, 
visualized The Star Walkers. He 
was in love with the middle 
drummer, a girl named Ange- 
lique Roust. 

Ballenger had seen Angelique 
on TV and instantly fallen in 
love with her. She replaced his 
previous love, Miss Terri Paul, 
flutist, a person, in retrospect, 
with no bust worthy of men- 
tion. 

Now it seemed, over the eggs 
and coffee in the natural bright- 
ness of morning, fantastic that 
such a collection as Miss Terri 
Paul could have attracted even 
his momentary attention, much 
less captivated him for a single 



174 



minute, let alone nearly five 
whole months. He vowed against 
eternity that he would never, 
never, never show Miss Terri 
Paul’s TV tapes again, and if 
he heard her on radio, he would 
refuse to listen. This would be 
proof of his love for Angelique. 

Pie finished his coffee. The 
news was coming on, blaring out 
over the sounds of cool jazz. 
There were, in the world, the 
nations of crime and the na- 
tions of law and order; he be- 
longed to the latter. All were 
democracies, whether they knew 
it or not, but some were in- 
sane. This was scarcely sur- 
prising when you considered evo- 
lution. 

Out came the letter: Final 

Notice! The amount, including 
postage, was $23.47. 



allenger — ” began the let- 
ter, omitting the custom- 
ary salutation “ — your actions 
indicate you have no intention 
of paying the enclosed bill. If 
this bill is not paid immediately, 
I will be forced to institute legal 
action, which may involve your 
employer. You will be liable 
for all costs incurred in collec- 
tion. To avoid embarrassment 
and the extra expense, your 
check in the amount of $23.47 
must be received by return mail. 
I mean business. This is the 
last notice I will send before 



forwarding the bill to the Cali- 
fornia Courts for collection. F. 
Terrace Watson, Attorney at 
Law.” 

The bill was clearly illegal. 
Watson had been given every 
chance to prove his case: and 
had failed dismally. 

Item one: Jury trial. 

Item two: Superior court re- 
view. 

Item three: Supreme court de- 
cision. 

All favored Ballenger. Watson 
did not care enough even to 
present his case on the appeal, 
and Ballenger, out of a sense 
of fairness, had continued the 
proceedings on his own initia- 
tive. Now this man, Watson, 
was threatening the very nation 
itself. 

Ballenger folded the letter and 
replaced it in his inner suit- 
coat pocket. Breakfast finished, 
he put the dishes in the ma- 
chine. Seven twenty in the 
morning. Normally time to leave 
for work. Switchboard opens in 
exactly thirty-five minutes. Time 
was a rubber band, stretching 
out. 

He removed his credit-card 
receipts. We will audit the ac- 
counts this morning. Prudent 
financial management is the 
foundation of the nation. The 
Secretary of the Treasury was 
summoned. 

Two dollars and fifty-nine 

175 



BALLENGER'S PEOPLE 



cents, plus tax, for a six-pack 
of half quart cans of beer. Five 
cans were still in the refrigera- 
tor. The supply would last an- 
other month. The Secretary of 
the Treasury waived the right 
to appeal -and agreed the ex- 
pense was reasonable. Three 
dollars and eighty-nine cents for 
dry cleaning: an unavoidable 

expense. Ten dollars, thirteen 
cents: a lube and oil job, rotors 
adjusted, fuel tank filled. No 
argument there. Forty-seven 
cents for a large chocolate bar. 
They called in the Surgeon 
General on that one. To the 
bathroom scale. Ballenger had 
picked up four ounces by the 
scale. Back to the accounts. 
Let’s watch that candy. Ballen- 
ger agreed. 

Four dollars and ten cents, in- 
cluding tips, for dinner in the 
restaurant last night. This Wed- 
nesday’s expense was sanctioned 
by tradition, and recent polls 
showed it was approved by 
eighty-three per cent of the citi- 
zens. Of the $25 he allowed him- 
self for the period, he still had 
three dollars plus change. Close 
enough. The Secretary of the 
Treasury was satisfied. 

Snap! went the rubber band. 
Five minutes before eight. 

Ballenger phoned the switch- 
board. 

“Thank you for calling Meritt 
and Finch,” said the recording. 



“Space research is our special- 
ty.” 

He said, “Ballenger from Ac- 
counting. I have some personal 
business to take care of this 
morning. I’ll be in after lunch.” 

“Thank you for your message, 
Mr. Ballenger,” said the ma- 
chine. 

r T''raffic above Los Angeles 
would begin breaking in an- 
other fifteen minutes. It was a 
twenty-minute flight to the of- 
fice of F. Terrace Watson, At- 
torney at Law. Leave at eight 
fifteen, be there at twenty-five 
before nine. 

Ballenger checked the day- 
shift workers. Everyone seemed 
at his job. Pulse was good, 
heartbeat steady, respiration nor- 
mal. Swing shift would be go- 
ing to bed in another hour. Most 
of the night shift probably 
hadn’t gone back to sleep after 
voting on the day of the week. 
They should be up stirring. 
Should try to get all of today’s 
major business out of the way 
before nine, nine-thirty, so the 
swing shift could get their rest. 

Some sort of a proxy agree- 
ment really must be worked out, 
if it can be done democratically. 
We’ve got to send legislation 
to that effect up to the next 
Congress. Note: Cabinet meet- 
ing on Sunday should discuss 
this.

Meanwhile, one of the prob- 
lems was too many important 
decisions. The executive him- 
self could do something about 
that. Should definitely cut down 
on the number of major deci- 
sions, keep them to a bare min- 
imum, try to get them all out 
of the way before nine o’clock. 
No excuse for decisions in the 
middle of the day. A well run 
country shouldn’t have emer- 
gencies. 

Yet the evils of dictatorships 
are too well known to review: 
an evolutionary failure of the 
organism. Strange so few saw 
this very point with the clarity 
of Ballenger. 

Promptly at eight twelve, he 
buzzed the garage of his depar- 
ture and left the apartment, 
checking to be sure the door 
latch was set to lock. Two min- 
utes later, he was on the roof. 
The morning rush having pass- 
ed, the mechanical attendant 
had already assembled the 
blades. He stepped in, and the 
radios came on with the igni- 
tion. He hummed in time, tap- 
ping the control bar. 

Airborne, the Security Forces 
relaxed. Once again he had re- 
membered to lock the door. The 
day-shift technicians, well rest- 
ed, began to supervise the com- 
plicated motor activity connect- 
ed with flying. The pilot stood 
at the bridge, in command, stud- 



ying meaningful lights as they 
flashed their careful traffic pat- 
terns, responding with the neces- 
sary movements. 

Ballenger again wished there 
were some way to introduce 
more automation. Perhaps he 
should take it up with his Scien- 
tific Advisory Group. But if the 
SAG could work out a way, 
what about unemployment, long 
solved among nations, but an 
ever-present internal danger? 

No! Better to have jobs for 
all than to have to worry about 
chronic unemployment. The 
thing to avoid was overtime. The 
union was very difficult when 
it came to overtime. Four hours 
off for each hour on. Once, af- 
ter a very difficult week at the 
office, he had spent all of Friday 
in bed to catch up. 

The blades joined traffic. 

A t eight thirty, between com- 
mercials, came the news- 
break. It was the one thing he 
really did not like about the 
station. Ballenger frowned in an- 
noyance. The nations of crime 
seemed to have the upper hand: 
an aggression in Florida, a war 
on the streets of Los Angeles. 
Incomprehensible. Pointless. 

He checked again with his 
legal staff. There was no possi- 
ble question that Watson’s de- 
mand was completely illegal. 
There was no legal way Ballen- 



BALLENGER'S PEOPLE 



177 



ger could be made to pay. Still, 
this being a foreign affair, rather 
than a domestic one, you could 
never be entirely sure of re- 
sults. 

Ballenger had long fought a 
mental battle with other nations 
for territorial integrity. To the 
things of the flesh, flesh; to the 
things of the spirit, spirit. It 
was difficult to know whether 
or not he was being ignored 
completely, for no other nation 
ever made a sign of having 
heard him on this matter. He 
called in the Secretary of State. 
We’ll rest our case, said the 
Secretary, on external law. We 
will negotiate, but we will not 
arbitrate. 

Music came back on. He 
wished they’d play one of An- 
gelique’s records. It would be 
good to know she was backing 
him in this matter. 

But of course she was. An- 
gelique was a nation like him- 
self: a hater of injustice every- 
where. Hadn’t she already prov- 
ed that, time after time? Hadn’t 
she whispered it to him over 
TV? Of course she supported 
him. With the total resources of 
her body. 

Ballenger thought of his job 
at Meritt and Finch. Wisely, the 
citizens had expressed their will 
to him: never talk to anyone 
at Meritt and Finch unless ab- 
solutely necessary. If you don’t 



talk to them, we don’t have to 
be always making decisions. You 
don’t have to be bothering the 
citizens all the time, getting the 
swing shift out of bed with 
emergency votes. 

So Ballenger kept busy with 
his punch cards and forms and 
rows of figures and files. Feed- 
ing the computer. Which was 
composed of an almost infinite 
number of little things going 
yes and no. With such uncom- 
plicated fundamentals as that, 
it was a mystery the thing 
could even add. 

And Ballenger smiled, and he 
answered questions, and he nev- 
er went out to lunch with any- 
one. 

Twenty before nine: a com- 
mercial. Traffic was unusually 
heavy. He had hovered almost 
motionless for nearly five min- 
utes. Now a lane was open. The 
building was less than a quar- 
ter of a mile away, and he 
entered the descent level, check- 
ing visually. He tensed as an 
idiot pilot dropped too rapid- 
ly. Probably an emerging na- 
tion. What’s the hurry? 

Moments later, he was park- 
ed safely. He surrendered the 
blades to an attendant for a 
claim check. The check looked 
all right. 

He walked quickly to the ele- 
vator and checked the directory 
posted on the wall. It told him 



178 



GALAXY 



the enemy was on the third 
floor: Suite 315. 

Down he went. 

T7. Terrace Watson was seated 
behind his desk in the inner 
office, surrounded by file cab- 
inets, an addressograph machine, 
a postage meter, a voice typer 
and a computer with memory 
storage. 

Watson looked up from his 
desk in the inner office when 
he heard the corridor door open. 
It was too early for the mail 
drop. Who could it be at this 
hour? His part-time secretary, 
an expensive extravagance which 
flattered his ego, would not be 
in until after lunch for the mail- 
ing, so he arose and went 
through the door to greet the 
visitor, presumably a salesman. 

Ballenger stood nervously be- 
side the vacant receptionist’s 
desk. He was dressed in a con- 
servative suit, a style which had 
not changed appreciably for the 
last sixty years, in contrast to 
the vacillation of women’s 
fashions; he was short, had a 
receding hairline and weighed 
no more than 120 pounds. 

Watson was a tall man, many 
pounds Ballenger’s superior, 
with a face that was heavy from 
rich foods and the eyes of a dic- 
tator. 

Suppose the unsupposable, 
Ballenger’s Chief of Planning 



Operations whispered. Consider 
every possibility, no matter how 
remote. A nation prepares for 
all contingencies. Merritt and 
Finch would demand an expla- 
nation for his refusal to pay 
this illegal bill. 

“You are F. Terrace Watson?” 
he asked. “My name is Bart 
Ballenger.” 

And if Ballenger, as Chief 
Executive, allowed the job at 
Meritt and Finch to be lost, the 
citizens would most certainly re- 
volt and throw him out of office. 
With no one to run the na- 
tion, it would become very sick. 

“Yes?” asked Watson. “What 
can I do for you? If it’s about 
employment — ” 

“You don’t know me?” asked 
Ballenger in amazement. “You 
are F. Terrace Watson, the at- 
torney?” Ballenger was disturb- 
ed by this development. How 
could the attorney, who had 
written him so many letters, 
each signed with a savage flour- 
ish, fail to recognize the name 
Bart Ballenger? There was a 
mystery, here. What did the 
Secretary of Defense think? 

Watson searched his thoughts. 
Someone from one of his ex- 
wives? Someone from Ernie, try- 
ing to collect the little bit he 
still owed from the Santa Anita 
meeting? A process server? 

Ballenger brought out the let- 
ter. 



BALLENGER'S PEOPLE 



179 



TJallenger had been with Mer- 
^ itt and Finch for eleven 
years; he could never find an- 
other job as good. So Watson, 
at all costs, must be stopped 
from notifying them. How could 
Ballenger present a legal brief 
to Mr. Herreras in defense of his 
refusal to pay this illegal bill? 
Mr. Herreras did not even know 
that he was one nation, under 
God, with all kinds of different 
people inside him, and it isn’t 
safe to talk to fascists who don’t 
even understand that elementary 
fact. Evolution decrees their de- 
feat, but natural selection is 
a slow process. 

“It’s about this,” said Bal- 
lenger. 

Instantly Watson assumed the 
stern countenance and demeanor 
appropriate to the profession. 
“Let’s see, Mr. Ballenger. I 
believe it’s about the overdue 
account that you wish to see 
me?” He reached out for the 
letter and glanced at the 
amount. “Twenty-three dollars 
and forty-seven cents.” 

“I want to talk to you about 
that.” 

“Well, let’s just step into the 
office, here, Mr. Ballenger. I’m 
glad you realize just how serious 
this matter is. I’m glad to see 
you’ve come down in person 
to straighten it out. Please sit 
down.” 

As Watson walked around his 



desk to his chair, a tiny doubt 
opened a crevasse in his 
thoughts and uneasiness leaked 
out. In the memory of his pro- 
fession, which was long and hon- 
orable, had anyone ever called 
personally? Not that he was 
aware of. This was the most 
mail order of all businesses, 
composed of fleshless names, 
first-class postage stamps, white 
paper, black print, stern taped 
warnings for the larger delin- 
quents. Human breath sent it 
into disarray, and Watson felt 
uncomfortable in his own office. 
Let us explore the situation, 
which may be delicate or fraught 
with annoyance. 

“Now,” said Watson, after 
seating himself, “Mr. Ballenger, 
if you’ll just let me have your 
check for $23.47, we can put 
an immediate end to this mat- 
ter, and you will be spared any 
possible future embarassment 
and inconvenience. If the 
amount is a little too much for 
you right now, I know we can 
work out a satisfactory payment 
plan. Many of my accounts pay 
as little as five dollars a week. 
I understand how people can 
get in over their heads on mat- 
ters like this, and I want to be 
as reasonable as I can be.” 

“It’s not the money, you 
know that,” said Ballenger, run- 
ning the words together, still 
standing. 



180 



GALAXY 



Watson frowned sternly. He 
made it a practice of ignoring 
all letters from accounts which 
did not contain money. Had 
Ballenger written protesting the 
bill? “Do I understand there’s 
been some mistake? From the 
account number, here, this is 
for some musical tapes, isn’t it? 
Didn’t you receive the merchan- 
dise? Was the recording poor? 
Fuzzy pictures? If that’s the 
case, I’ll have to go back to 
the company with this, and if 
their records are in order, and 
if you haven’t complained with- 
in the required time — ” He left 
unspoken any direct threat. 

Ballenger observed that the at- 
torney was introducing irrelevant 
material. “I received the tapes, 
they were satisfactory in quali- 
ty,” he said. Diplomatic Corp 
personnel came forward with ad- 
vice, prepared with documents. 
The Secretary of State cleared 
his throat. “I think you will have 
to agree, as an attorney and a 
specialist, that asking us to pay 
for these Miss Terri Paul tapes 
is the equivalent of demanding 
we pay alimony. You have no 
proof whatsover that indicates 
we have ever been married.” 

XTatson rolled the key to the 
* * voice typer between thumbs 
and forefingers. The accounts, of 
whom this man was one, were 
purchased at twenty-five cents 



on the dollar in blocks of one 
thousand. A few were always 
totally uncollectable because of 
legitimate reasons : merchandise 
returned and not credited, de- 
fective merchandise, incorrect 
merchandise, unordered mer- 
chandise .... Out of this group 
of ten to twenty in each block 
of accounts, one or two might 
threaten legal or other action 
upon receipt of dunning letters. 
Standard practice ignored them. 
They had no case; the dunning 
letters always complied exactly 
with the applicable laws of the 
State of California. 

Such people, however, were 
nuisances, and Watson consid- 
ered for the merest instant 
whether or not Ballenger might 
be an unusually aggressive ex- 
ample of that type. But any 
suspicion that Ballenger was con- 
templating a law suit evaporat- 
ed, and Watson saw that he 
was dealing, instead, with a 
maniac. New forms of insanity 
were breaking out all over, as 
a tragic consequence of universal 
peace. 

The sensible thing, Watson 
knew, was to stand from his 
chair, ease the man quietly from 
the office, lock the door and 
hope Ballenger would not come 
back. 

“You’re perfectly correct, Mr. 
Ballenger. There is no reason 
for you to pay this bill. I’ll see 



BALLENGER'S PEOPLE 



181 



that you’re not bothered by it 
any more. A tragic misunder- 
standing for which I apologize.” 

Watson stood up. He moved 
to the side of the desk. Would 
more reassurance be required? It 
was difficult now. “I’m sure this 
alimony matter will work out, 
too,” he added. 

Ballenger was outweighed by 
one hundred pounds and was a 
good six inches shorter than his 
enemy. One equalized such con- 
tests. He looked up at the at- 
torney. So now he was going to 
be threatened with alimony. 
What was behind that threat? 
He was in trouble enough al- 
ready. 

Better ask the Secretary of the 
Interior: have we ever to your 
knowledge been liable for ali- 
mony? The answer, in the nega- 
tive, came back. Still dissatisfied, 
he said, This is a very serious 
matter; could we be liable with- 
out our knowledge? His Scien- 
tific Advisor assured him that 
it was completely impossible. 

“I deny any knowledge of ali- 
mony,” Ballenger told Watson. 

“Just don’t worry about any- 
thing,” said Watson, soothingly. 

Ballenger realized this might 
be even worse than he had an- 
ticipated. What would Mr. Her- 
reras say to this? Charges were 
piling up too rapidly. From his 
own logic, which was impeccable, 
sprang a new accusation. 



Could this man Watson know 
Miss Terri Paul and her sorry 
collection of constituents? Was 
there a conspiracy, had treaties 
been made against him, was ag- 
gression contemplated? 

Watson spoke as though to a 
child. “You just put it out of 
your mind. Go home and rest. 
You don’t feel very good this 
morning.” 

'jp allenger felt panic. The Chief 
JL ^ Medical Officer said, I’m 
afraid we’ve run into another nut, 
here. The world is full of such 
nations, they cause all the trou- 
ble. 

This one, said the Chief of 
Security Forces, is a lawyer. 
Lawyers are the most dangerous 
of all. They can exhume treaties 
to the days of King John to 
cite against us. 

Watson, looking down on the 
man he completely dominated 
physically, felt a moment of 
compassion. Ballenger was sick; 
he needed help. Watson decided 
to probe the extent of this post- 
Freudian psychosis, to divine in 
which direction help for the poor, 
disturbed man might lie. “You 
have some relatives here?” 

“The question,” said Ballen- 
ger, “is an insult to national 
dignity! I am perfectly capable 
of fighting my own wars!” 

A little flicker of fear came 
to Watson. Against the power of 



182 



GALAXY 



a madman, his physical advan- 
tage might be cancelled. Ballen- 
ger might be capable of hurting 
him and, beyond that, might 
constitute a larger menace. The 
idea, half formed, that it would 
be possible to reason Ballenger 
into seeking medical attention, 
vanished. No other avenue of 
assistance lay open to the at- 
torney. In the absence of crimin- 
al conduct, only a relative could 
have Ballenger committed. 

Watson could prefer a mis- 
demeanor charge: but if the in- 
sanity were temporary, or if 
Ballenger could recover suffi- 
ciently to conceal it from the 
judge, then Watson himself, 
might be in an unfortunate and 
vulnerable legal position him- 
self: a suit for false arrest, or 
worse. The thing to do was defi- 
nitely to get him out of the of- 
fice as soon as possible. 

“Come along, now,” said Wat- 
son, reaching out. “Let’s walk 
out here in the corridor.” Once 
in the corridor, Watson could 
duck back in the office, slam the 
door and lock it. If Ballenger 
stayed outside, an anonymous 
call to the police might then re- 
sult in his detention for question- 
ing and lead to the court send- 
ing him to the sanctuary the state 
provided for such disturbed peo- 
ple. 

Ballenger shrugged off the 
hand. He checked to see that 



all his people were awake. A 
crisis was near. Once the man, 
Watson, got him into the cor- 
ridor, he would be attacked. All 
the other nations in the build- 
ing would see it, of course, but 
none would come to his defense. 
Ballenger had made no alliances 
here. His alliances were with the 
entertainment industry, in Hol- 
lywood, in New York City, in 
the TV industry. They were too 
far away to help him now! Could 
they even hear his cries? 

■'CTT'hat wild charges Watson 
* ' would make! And could 
the nation, with the best legal 
minds available, refute them? 
Watson was one of the extreme- 
ly mad ones: a prisoner of the 
past. He had not been able to 
escape evolution’s cul de sec: 
specialization. Watson treated 
all the organic components with- 
in himself with total contempt 
for their civil rights. Logical 
thought was impossible with 
him. Ballenger confronted a pri- 
mitive organism. 

So Watson was threatening to 
consider it as an international 
matter, beyond reasonable com- 
promise. Ballenger had come 
prepared for that. Was all dip- 
lomacy, forever, for nothing? 
Make one more try at private 
negotiation. 

“You’ll never get us before the 
United Nations,” Ballenger said. 



BALLENGER'S PEOPLE 



183 



“You know it’s stacked against 
us; you know we wouldn’t have 
a fair chance to defend our- 
selves; we’re outnumbered.” 

Ballenger sounded tire alarm. 
Everyone was appraised of the 
situation. Are you behind me, 
citizens? he cried. A resounding 
97 per cent: yes! 

Red alert! cried Ballenger’s 
Secretary of Defense. To arms! 
To arms! Man the barricades! 
Prepare to repel the invasion! 

Watson’s hand came out once 
more. It fixed on Ballenger’s 
shoulder. “Come along now. I 
think it’s time for you to leave!” 

The Secretary of Defense told 
Ballenger: He’s getting ready 

for a sneak attack! Hurry! 

Ballenger acted then. He de- 
clared a national emergency. 
The soldiers came forward, 
waves of them. 

Scientists readied the missle- 
launcher site and took control 
of the panel with flashing lights. 

Get out of my way! snarled 
the Secretary of Defense to the 
Secretary of State. This is ex- 
clusively a military matter, now! 

Ballenger removed the missile 
launcher from its hidden silo 
and twisted to his left, firing 
upward, once, bang! 

There was silence. The sound 
of Watson’s body as it met the 
carpet. Silence. 

We had to defend ourselves, 
he told the citizens. It was 



us or them. Eighty-one per 
cent approved the action. The 
pacifists, less than ten per cent 
of the population, had continued 
that portion of the work which 
had not contributed to the war 
effort. They now returned to 
full participation in the society. 

Ballenger congratulated the 
Secretary of Defense for always 
being prepared and put the mis- 
sile launcher in his pocket. 

The Security Forces took over. 
He had touched nothing in the 
office. No fingerprint problem. 

Ninety seconds later, the Se- 
curity Forces withdrew, and the 
technicians took over. He was 
at the control bar. The music 
of strings and oboes came from 
the radios. He looked at his 
watch. Just after nine. The 
swing shift people could get their 
sleep. He ended the emergency. 

He asked the Secretary of the 
Treasury: How was that? That’s 
the kind of war you like, isn’t 
it? Seventy-seven cents is all it 
cost us this time. Seventy-five 
cents for parking, two cents for 
the bullet. I run an economical 
administration. 

Some two hours later, when he 
was preparing to go to work, 
the Security Force people re- 
membered the letter on Attorney 
Watson’s desk, but by then it 
was too late to do anything 
about it but fire the Security 
chief. —KRIS NEVILLE

You Men of Yi&lenee 

by HARRY HARRISON 



He hated men of violence. 
But how could a pacifist 
resist their armed might? 



6 4T hate you, Raver,” the cap- 
-1- tain shouted, his strained 
face just inches away, “and I 
know you must hate me too.” 
“Hate is too strong a word,” 
the big man said quietly. “I 
think despise is much better.” 
There was no advance warning 
of the blow, the captain was too 
good a fighter for that; just the 
sudden jab that drove his fist in- 
to the other’s stomach. Raver’s 
only reaction was a slight and 
condescending grin. This infuri- 
ated the captain who, though a 
head shorter than Raver, was still 
over six feet tall. He expected 
some reaction other than scorn 
from the people he hit. In a blind 
rage he pummeled the other’s un- 
resisting form until Raver, leak- 
ing blood from nose and mouth, 
fell across the captain’s desk, 
then slid limply to the floor. 

“Get this carrion out,” the cap- 



tain ordered, rubbing at his 
bruised knuckles. “And clean up 
this filth.” There were smears of 
blood across the surface of the 
desk, and everything on it had 
been swept to the floor when 
Raver fell. The captain realized 
then that the blood was on him, 
too. He dabbed at it distastefully 
with the kerchief from his sleeve. 
Still, there was some satisfaction 
in seeing the half-conscious bulk 
being carried from the room. 
“Now who is smiling?” he shout- 
ed after them, then went out him- 
self to wash and change. 

Though the captain did not 
know it yet, he was the loser. 
From the moment he had board- 
ed the prison ship two weeks ear- 
lier, Raver had been planning 
this encounter. All of his actions, 
his earlier confrontations with 
the captain, the hunger strike 
when the Phreban had been tor- 



185 



tured, every bit of it had been 
planned with this final scene in 
mind. Raver had pushed the but- 
tons; the captain had reacted as 
planned, and Raver had won. He 
leaned against the metal wall of 
his cell, clutching tightly to the 
pencil-sized communicator that 
was concealed by his giant fist. 
When he had fallen across the 
desk he had palmed it. This was 
the reason for everything he had 
done. 

Sighing heavily, Raver slump- 
ed to the floor and rolled over 
on his side. It was no accident 
that his back was to the glass eye 
of the monitor pickup, or that the 
barred door of his cell was in 
sight. Unobserved — and safe 
from surprise visitors — he al- 
lowed himself to smile as he set 
to work. 

IT e had only a single tool, a nail 
which he had hidden in his 
boot sole and filed flat against 
the metal side of his bunk during 
the night. The squared tip now 
made a tiny screwdriver. His 
hand was a vise, and his finger- 
nails pliers and wrench. It was 
enough. There was no one still 
alive who knew Raver’s real 
name or anything about his ear- 
lier life before he went into 
crime and politics, and he certain- 
ly did not look like a typical mi- 
crotechnician. Yet that was what 
he was, and a highly skilled one 
186 



as well. The case of the communi- 
cator sprang .open under his 
touch, and the delicate leaves of 
the circuits fanned out. He went 
to work. There were only a few 
hours left to setdown, and he 
needed all of them. 

With infinite patience he dis- 
assembled the components, then 
rejoined them in new circuitry of 
his own design. He struck an arc 
from the tiny battery to solder 
the connections and could only 
hope that enough power remained 
to operate his device. It took a 
fraction over three hours to con- 
struct, and for all of that time he 
lay still, with just his hands mov- 
ing, an apparently unconscious 
bulk to the watchers in the 
prisoner control center. Only 
when the work was done did he 
permit himself to groan and 
stretch and to climb shakily to 
his feet. As he went to the barred 
door he stumbled, then held to 
the bars with one hand and press- 
ed his forehead against die cool 
metal. In the preceding weeks he 
had stood this way for a good 
part of the waking day, so it was 
not considered unusual. 

His right hand, shielded by his 
body, slid the wire probe into the 
opening of the lock while he slow- 
ly turned the knob on the vari- 
able capacitor. 

An RF lock is theoretically 
pick-proof, but that is just theory. 
In practice a trained technician 

GALAXY 



can cause the circuit to resonate 
at the keying frequency, which is 
what Raver did. A needle flick- 
ered briefly, and he made care- 
ful adjustments until it jumped 
across the dial and up against its 
stop. This was the operating fre- 
quency. Then he went to the sink 
and cleaned some of the blood 
from his face and at the same 
time reversed connections so that 
the probe became a transmitter. 

He was ready. 

\A7~k en ^ ie hooters sounded 
v ’ the two-minute warning for 
strapping down he paused for a 
moment at the door before going 
to his cot, which served double 
duty as an acceleration couch. 
The device had worked: he had 
felt the click as the electronic 
actuator had tripped the lock. 
The door was open. Just before 
the landing rockets flared he 
pulled up his blanket and rolled 
over on his side to face the wall. 

The rear jets kicked hard with 
3G’s, and the webbing of the bed 
stretched and creaked while 
Raver pulled himself slowly to 
his feet. This was the only time 
he could be sure that the guards 
in prison control center would 
not be watching him. While they 
were fighting the deceleration he 
had to do what must be done. 
One shuffling step at a time, he 
drove himself across the cell, the 
muscles in his legs knotted and 
YOU MEN OF VIOLENCE 



rock-hard. The stool’s three 
metal legs were welded to the 
floor; he had examined them and 
felt their thickness days earlier. 
Dropping heavily to his knees he 
seized the nearest leg in both 
hands, tensed his body — then 
pulled. The leg broke with a 
sharp crack. The other two were 
freed the same way; then a slow 
shuffle back to the bed, onto 
which he put the stool and pulled 
the blanket over it. 

The ruse would not bear close 
examining, but it had to fool the 
watching guard on the screens for 
only a brief time. Back across the 
cell to the door, through it, close 
it, lock it, and down the passage- 
way. His knees crumpled as more 
jets cut in for landing, 5G’s or 
more, but Raver continued on 
his hands and knees. He could 
move about safely only as long 
as the rockets were firing. When 
they cut out, the crewmen and 
guards would unstrap and come 
out, and he would be caught. 
Painfully and slowly he dragged 
himself across the passageway to 
the connecting ladder and began 
to work his way down. 

The jets stopped when he was 
halfway down. He let go of the 
ladder and dropped. 

Since the gravity on Houdt is 
less than Earth normal, and be- 
cause the fall was only fifteen 
feet, Raver did not injure himself, 
although he landed heavily. He 

187 



rolled and crashed into the door 
with his shoulder as he came to 
his feet, throwing it open. Then 
he was through and running, 
heading for the spacesuit locker. 
All around him he knew men 
were unstrapping themselves and 
rising, on their way. A door open- 
ed as he passed it, and there was 
the sudden loud murmur of 
voices. Someone started through 
it — then turfied back to say 
something. 

Raver hit the door of the lock- 
er, was through and closed it and 
leaned against it. 

There was no alarm. 

Neither was there any time to 
waste. He took a long, shuddering 
breath, ignored his aching mus- 
cles and turned to the racked 
space suits. The largest one, with 
its flexible fabric stretched to the 
limit, made a snug fit, and he 
pulled it on. If he closed the hel- 
met it would draw attention in- 
side the ship — but if he left it 
open he would be instantly recog- 
nized. But the extra oxygen tanks 
would shield his face and serve a 
double purpose. The large refill 
tanks weighed over a hundred 
pounds apiece. He did not dare 
take more than two; carrying 
more might draw attention. He 
had to go left, so he swung the 
tanks onto his right shoulder and 
pushed the door open. When he 
went out he walked with his 
shoulder almost brushing the wall 

188 



and the tanks shielding his face. 

Footsteps passed him, but he 
was not stopped. He went down 
two decks and saw the guard on 
the emergency airlock just as the 
alarms sounded. Raver walked on 
steadily, neither faster nor slow- 
er, though the guard jumped ner- 
vously and slipped his rifle from 
his shoulder and held it at port 
arms. 

“What is it? What’s happen- 
ed?” he called to Raver, then 
turned to look down the connect- 
ing corridor. The pulsating hoot- 
ers split the air. “Who are you?” 
the guard asked when Raver 
came closer. It was only then, far 
too late, that he tried to bring 
his rifle to bear. 

Raver reached out with his 
free hand and took the man by 
the throat so he could not shout 
a warning, then pulled him close 
so he could not use the gun. One 
long finger moved up to the ar- 
tery under the guard’s ear and 
clamped down, cutting off the 
flow of blood to the brain. The 
man struggled helplessly for a 
few seconds, then slumped, un- 
conscious. Raver was careful to 
lay him gently on the deck be- 
fore he stripped him of weapon 
and munition pouches, slung the 
rifle over his shoulder and open- 
ed the airlock. There were shouts 
behind him as he closed and 
dogged it shut, but he ignored 
them.

him,” the captain order- 
ed, his face suffused with 
blood. “Bring him back to me. 
Kill him only if you must because 
I want to see him die. Do you 
understand?” 

“Yes, sir,” Lieutenant N’Ness 
said, keeping his face expression- 
less. “I’ll need a squad of the 
most fit men to go with me.” 

“You have them. What to you 
plan to do?” 

N’Ness snapped open a map 
and spread it cm the desk. He 
was. a career soldier, and after 
this tour of field duty he was re- 
turning to staff college. He ex- 
plained with professional brevity. 

“The ship is here, near the base 
of the cliff, within the usual land- 
ing area. Raver can gain nothing 
by going towards the prison mines 
here — and in fact all the ob- 
servers place him on a 86-degree 
course towards the foothills here. 
This makes sense. The nearest 
mining settlement — other than 
the prison — is here, on the other 
side of the mountains. It is operat- 
ed by Puliaans.” 

“The devil!” 

“Exactly. If Raver reaches 
them they will give him sanctu- 
ary, and there is nothing that we 
can do about it.” 

“I know what I would like to 
do,” the captain mumbled, 
clenching his fist. 

“You’re not the only one,” 
Lieut. N’Ness said. “But Puliaa 



has three times our population 
and five times our industrial ca- 
pacity. There is nothing that we 
can do.” 

“Yet. Some day, though . .” 

“To be sure. Meanwhile, the 
escaped 1 prisoner is heading for 
sanctuary. He has taken two re- 
fill tanks in addition to the tank 
on his suit. This will give him 
enough oxygen to reach the 
Puliaan mine — but only by the 
most direct route. If he tries to 
hide or dodge about he will not 
make it in time. I intend to fol- 
low at once with the best men 
available, each carrying a single 
spare oxygen tank. We will be 
light and fast. We will capture 
him and return.” 

“Go, then. You .have my in- 
structions.” 

The squad had already suited 
up, and N’Ness hurried to join 
them. In spite of the need for 
speed he checked every weapon, 
ammunition pouch and oxygen 
tank before moving them out. 
Then they left on the double, 
across the plain and into the 
foothills, following directions ra- 
dioed from the ship, heading for 
the spot where Raver had van- 
ished from sight. 

“I have it,” N’Ness called 
back. “Dislodged stones, foot- 
prints; there is a clear trail here 
that I can follow. Next report in 
one hour.” He led the squad into 
the mountains of Houdt. 



YOU MEN OF VIOLENCE 



189 



TToudt. A ruined and gutted 

A world with its atmosphere 
stripped away in some ancient 
cataclysm, its surface riven and 
its metallic core laid bare. There 
were heavy metals here for the 
taking, all the power metals that 
made a voyage across the light- 
years possible. Since there was 
still more than enough for all 
there was no competition, and the 
planet’s surface was dotted with 
mines, each maintained by a dif- 
ferent world or syndicate. The 
best of them were robot operated, 
the worst of them by human 
slaves. 

Raver had the temperament to 
be neither a slave or a slave hold- 
er, yet there was no other choice 
on his world. He went into op- 
position of the established regime, 
and it is remarkable that his op- 
position lasted as many years as 
it did before he, inevitably, end- 
ed up on Houdt. Nor was he dead 
yet. Once over the mountains 
and down into the Puliaan settle- 
ment, and he would be safe. 

The oxygen tanks were slung 
on his back to free his arms, and 
he needed his arms on these steep 
slopes. As he pulled himself up 
the face of the fissured rock it ex- 
ploded silently next to him, boul- 
ders, dust and gravel billowing 
out. He felt the concussion 
through his fingertips and let go 
his hold and slid back down to 
the safety of the jagged rocks be- 
190 



low. Looking through a fissure he 
saw his pursuers for the first 
time, kneeling in an ordered row 
as they fired. As soon as he van- 
ished from sight they jumped to 
their feet and came on. Raver 
went on as well, taking a longer 
course that would keep him out 
of their sights. 

“We’ll rest now,” Lietuenant 
N’Ness ordered as the sun neared 
the horizon. His men dropped. 
The chase had begun soon after 
dawn, and the days here were 
twenty standard hours long. They 
were in the far northern latitudes 
where the axial tilt conspired to 
form a night less than three hours 
in length. N’Ness had considered 
pushing on through the darkness, 
but it would not be worthwhile. 
The climbing was almost impos- 
sible at night, and his men were 
exhausted. They would sleep and 
catch the slave before another 
sunset. 

“A two-man guard, one hour 
for each watch,” he said. “Stack 
all the extra oxygen tanks here. 
In the morning we’ll top our 
tanks and see how many of these 
we can leave behind.” 

Most of them were asleep be- 
fore he finished talking. He kick- 
ed the nearest one awake to help 
him collect the tanks, then they 
sat, back to back, for the first 
watch. 

The sunlight hit first on the 
highest peaks at dawn, but with- 

GALAXY 



out an atmosphere to diffuse the 
light only the smallest, reflected 
part fell on the camp. The third 
watch, on the lieutenant’s orders, 
was waking them up, and they 
were just starting to stir when 
the night exploded. 

It was light, flame, then dark- 
ness, and the shouts of frightened 
men in the darkness. The lieuten- 
ant beat them into order, and the 
arrival of full dawn showed them 
that their reserve store of oxygen 
had been destroyed. 

T> econstructing what had hap- 
pened was not hard. Raver 
must have crept close during the 
night, lain there, then walked in 
at dawn, just one more space- 
suited man. He had put a bomb 
of some kind in among the tanks, 
then escaped in the confusion 
following the blast. N’Ness had 
underestimated him. 

“He will pay for it,” the lieu- 
tenant said coldly. “He lost his 
lead by coming back to do this 
— and he will not regain it. Fall 
in and check tanks.” 

The spare oxygen cylinders 
were gone, but there was still 
some oxygen left in the suit tanks. 

» With ruthless efficiency N’Ness 
bled these tanks into his, until 
his was full and the others close 
to empty. “Get back to the ship,” 
he ordered. “As soon as you get 
past these last hills use your ra- 
dio. You should be able to raise 
YOU MEN OF VIOLENCE 



either the ship or the mine. Tell 
them to bring oxygen out to 
meet you in case you don’t have 
enough to make it all the way. 
I’m going on, and I’ll bring the 
prisoner back. Report that to the 
captain. Now move out.” 

N’Ness did not watch them go. 
In fact, he had already forgotten 
their existence. He was going to 
catch Raver. He was going to 
march him back at gunpoint. It 
would make the captain very 
happy, and it would look very 
good on his record. He almost 
ran up the slope ahead. 

The lieutenant was the lighter 
man, lie was not as heavily bur- 
dened, and he had the advantage 
of being the follower, not the 
pathfinder. Where Raver had 
worked his way around a difficult 
patch of broken rock, N’Ness 
went straight through, counting 
upon his speed and agility. He 
did not slow or rest, and his pant- 
ing breath was echoed by the 
whine of the conditioning unit as 
it labored to remove the excess 
water vapor and heat. It was an 
insane chase, but as long as he 
did not slip or collapse from ex- 
haustion it could have only one 
end. 

Raver pulled himself up onto 
the broad ledge and through a 
gap in the rocks he could see the 
tall pithead workings of the 
Puliaan mines. He started for- 
ward, and his radio crackled in 

191 



his ear, and N’Ness’s voice said, 
“Just stop right where you are.” 
He stopped dead and looked 
slowly around. 

T ieutenant N’Ness stood on 
the ledge above, pointing his 
energy rifle. “Turn around,” 
N’Ness said, “and start right 
back where you came from.” He 
waggled the muzzle of the gun in 
the right direction. 

“Thank you, no,” Raver said, 
sitting down and slinging the 
oxygen tank to the ground. “I 
have no intention of returning.” 
“Enough talk. You have ten 
seconds to start moving — before 
I pull this trigger.” 

“Pull and be damned. I die 
here or I die back there. What 
difference does that make to me?” 
N’Ness had not expected this, 
and he had to think a moment 
before he answered. The steel 
edge of command was gone from 
his voice when he finally spoke. 
“You’re a reasonable man, 
Raver. There’s no reason to die 
out here, not when you can live 
and work . .” 

“Don’t act stupid. The role 
doesn’t become you. We both 
know that mine slaves are there 
for life — and a short life at 
that. There’ll be no more chances 
to escape. You’re the paid killer. 
Shoot.” 

N’Ness estimated the reserves 
in his tank and the spare Raver 

192 



carried and sat down himself. 
“You can leave out the insults,” 
he said. “I may have killed men 
in the line of duty, but I’ve never 
tortured or butchered people the 
way your so-called Pacifist 
Party . .” 

“Stop,” Raver ordered, lifting 
his hand. “You’re a victim of 
your own propaganda. It’s all lies. 
We do not kill. Think for your- 
self, if you are able to. Have you 
ever seen any of the atrocities 
committed that you speak about? 
Other than by your own people, 
that is.” 

“I’m not here to argue with 
you . .” 

“Unsatisfactory, try again. 
Have you seen these things?” 

“No, I haven’t. But that’s only 
because we shot first and fast 
before they could happen.” 

“Just as unsatisfactory, Lieu- 
tenant. You are avoiding the 
truth. You kill, we do not. That 
is the basic and important differ- 
ence between us. You are the ani- 
mal heritage of mankind, we are 
its future.” 

“Not so holy, please. You at- 
tacked the guard on the ship, 
and last night you tried to kill 
me and my men.” 

“That is not true. I do not kill. 
I rendered the guard unconscious, 
and I used the guard’s rifle and 
ammunition as a bomb to destroy 
your oxygen, to force you to turn 
back. Was anyone injured?” 

GALAXY 



“No, but — ” 

“yes, but,” Raver said loudly, 
jumping to his feet. “That is all 
the difference. Our aggressive 
traits brought us to the top of 
the animal kingdom, now we 
must renounce killing if we are 
to progress. We have this violence 
within us — I don’t deny I have 
it myself. But what good is our 
intellect if we cannot control it? 
Any man can desire a woman he 
sees in the street or jewelry in a 
display window, yet only the sick 
men rape and steal. We all 
possess the capacity for violence. 
Only the sick man kills.” 

“Not sickness,” N’Ness said, 
waggling the gun in Raver’s di- 
rection. “Just good sense. This 
wins arguments. The sensible 
man knows he can’t fight a gun, 
so he gets one himself and evens 
the score. That’s something you 
people will never learn. We al- 
ways win. We kill you.” 

“Yes, you kill us in great num- 
bers, but you cannot win. You 
do not change a man’s mind by 
eliminating him. What do you do 
when everyone is on the other 
side? Shoot them all? And after 
you have killed every man, 
woman and child — what do you 
do with your world?” 

“You’re being stupid now. This 
has been tried before, and when- 
ever the leaders are killed the 
mob does what it is told.” 

“Then there is something new 
YOU MEN OF VIOLENCE 



come into the universe,” Raver 
said quietly. “Perhaps it is the 
next development, homo super- 
ior, a mutation, men who are 
constitutionally unable to kill. 
This is not my theory, there have 
been scientific papers written on 
it . .” 

“All nonsense!” 

“Not really. Look at what hap- 
pened on Puliaa.” 

“Propaganda. The Pacifist 
Party there may be temporarily 
in power, but watch what hap- 
pens at the first sign of trou- 
ble.” 

“They’ve had their trouble, 
and they’ve weathered it well so 
far. And it is truth that a world- 
wide non-violent rebellion put 
them into power. It is what ev- 
eryone wanted.” 

“Lies!” 

“I doubt it.” Raver smiled. 
“You can’t ignore the fact that 
the entire planet is now vegetar- 
ian. Something happened. Why 
don’t you look into it before it is 
too late? I’m not the first one to 
believe that those who live by 
the sword die by it.” 

i&nphat’s enough talk,” N’Ness 
said, standing. “You’ll 
come back with me now.” 

“No.” 

“If you don’t come I’ll shoot 
you down, now, and send men for 
your body. You have no choice.” 
“Would you do that? Just pull 

193 



the trigger and kill a man? Re- 
move a life for no reason? I find 
it hard to imagine, I am incap- 
able of such an evil act.” 

“It is not evil — and I have 
good reason. You are an enemy, 
I have orders.” 

“Those are not reasons, just ex- 
cuses. An animal kills to eat or 
in defense of its own life or the 
lives of others. All else is corrup- 
tion.” 

“One last warning,” N’Ness 
said, aiming the gun steadily at 
the other’s midrif. “Your argu- 
ments mean nothing. Come with 
me or I shoot you.” 

“Don’t do this to yourself, 
Lieutenant. Here is a chance 
rarely offered to your kind. You 
can stop killing. You can go with 
me to Puliaa and discover what 
it is like not to be an animal. 
Don’t you realize the raper rapes 
himself? Who would want to live 
in the head of a rapist? So does 
the killer kill himself, and this 



is probably the only kind of kill- 
ing a man of peace can under- 
stand. We do not like it, but by 
necessity we accept it. Only when 
your kind is gone can my kind 
make this galaxy the place it 
should be.” 

“You fool!” the lieutenant 
shouted. “You’re dying, not me! 
Your last chance.” 

“You will kill yourself,” Rav- 
er said calmly. 

The lieutenant’s lips pulled 
back from his teeth, and he shout- 
ed with rage as he pulled the trig- 
ger. 

The gun blew up, killing him 
instantly. 

“I’m sorry,” Raver said. “I 
tried to tell you; during the 
night I fixed your rifle to ex- 
plode. You should have come 
with me.” 

Head lowered with sorrow, 
Raver turned and walked 
towards the mine visible below.

FORECAST 

This month’s editorial makes a fiat prediction: interstellar travel 
within the lifetime of most people now alive. In the next issue we have 
for you a “model” — that is, a science-fiction story — constructed around 
that prediction. In To Outlive Eternity, a voyage is under way to a near- 
by star. But . even interstellar space is not altogether empty. And 
what happens when a vessel traveling at sub-light speeds hits even the 
most tenuous of gas clouds? 

Poul Anderson has the answer; and it’s in next month’s Galaxy, with 
a Gray Morrow cover from a story by Roger Zelazny called The Man 
Who Loved the Faioli There’s a complete short novel by Larry Niven, 
The Adults. Willy Ley brings us some honest-to-Plato real new informa- 
tion on that hoariest of legends, Atlantis. And lots more .

Do you have a restless urge to write? 



If so, you have much in common 
with successful authors. 

Read how 12 Famous Writers are 
helping people turn a restless urge for 
self-expression into success in writing 



Tliei c's something different about people who 
feel the urge to write. They have a spiritual 
hunger that sets them apart — even from family 
and friends. 

I f you have known this burning need to write, 
you, too, may have the gift successful authors 
possess . the recurring ache to put into words 
your innermost thoughts, your own experiences. 

Max Shulman started writing because “. it 
was write or bust." Faith Baldwin, after 80 
novels, still says: “I've never written exactly 
what I dreamed I'd write . you keep on try- 
ing." Successful authors like these know that 
this restless urge for self-expression is perhaps 
the most important ingredient of writing suc- 
cess. But, they realize it can waste away if you 
don't know how to gel started writing, or if you 
hesitate to try. 

Several years ago they joined forces with 
Rod Sel ling. Bennett Cerf. Bruce Catton, Mig- 
non G. Eberhart, John Caples, J. D. Ratcliff, 
Mark Wiseman, Rudolf Flesch, Red Smith and 
Bergen Evans, to form the Famous Writers 
School. They poured everything they knew 
about writing into a remarkable new kind of 
professional training course which trains you 
at home in your spare time. You begin with 
the fundamentals of all good writing — then 
specialize in Fiction, Non-Fiction, Advertising 
Writing or Business Writing. 

Each of your assignments is examined by an 
instructor who is a professional writer or editor. 
He goes over your work line by line, word by 
word, blue-penciling his changes right on your 
manuscript, much as an editor does with an 
established author. Then he returns it with a 
long letter of advice and guidance. 

This training works well. Our students have 
sold their writing to the Reader’s Digest, 




Rod Serling’s urge to write made him a 
leading TV dramatist (Twilight Zone, Patterns, 
Ret/niem for a Heavyweight) and won him 
six Emmy awards.

tion, and more than 100 other publications.
