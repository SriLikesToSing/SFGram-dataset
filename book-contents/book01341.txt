WHAT SCIENCE FICTION IS 


A few months ago we discussed, 
not very enthusiastically, the so- 
called ‘‘New Wave” in science fic- 
tion. Since then a fair amount has 
seen print, much of it in the huge 
anthology edited by Harlan Elliaoin, 
Dangerous Visions, With all respect 
to Ellison, who graces our pages in 
this issue, has in the past and will 
again, weVe still not particularly 
enthusiastic; and maybe we should 
be a little more specific about just 
why. 

There are all kinds of science fic- 
tion ; — space opera and satire, 
gadget stories and Freudian stories, 
stories to please almost any taste — 
but it seems to us that there is one 
kind that is of special interest, if 
only because it is the only kind of 
science fiction whose essential fea- 
tures cannot be duplicated anywhere 
else. 

That kind, of course, is the science 
fiction of other worlds. The kind in 
which some change of technology, 
social customs or whatever produces 
a change in the environment of man. 

This is special to science fiction. 
No other kind of story can make this 
daim. Every other kind of writing 
starts with an established environ- 
ment, and the characters move inside 
it. We can generate our own, and 
this makes possible the telling of new 
kinds of stories. 

Take a historical case: The detec- 
tive story is a kind of story that is 
essentially peculiar to our own time. 
It rests on certain environmental 
factors — that murder is universally 
considered a crime, and that every 


caught muirderer was to stand trial 
and, if convicted, be punished. But 
throughout most of history this was 
only partially true and sometimes 
not true at all; a murderer might 
make no attempt to hide his act; all 
his effort would be bent to avoiding 
the retribution that the relatives 
or guild-brothers of the deceased 
might try to inflict on him. Sher- 
lock Holmes would have had no 
place in the Rome of the Borgias or 
in the Byzantine Empire. The Great 
Detective would have given way to, 
say, the Great Retaliator. 

And just as our age has made 
possible the telling of that new kind 
of story, the detective story, actually 
only a century or so old, so the ages 
to come will make possible the telling 
of new kinds of stories; and one of 
the most interesting things science 
fiction can do is to guess at what 
they will be and write them now. 

A shorter way to say all this is 
that fooling around with the 
way one writes a story seems to this 
reader, at least, to be inferior to in- 
venting new things for a story to 
say. Nearly all of the New Wave 
concerns itself with style instead of 
content. Sometimes what a writer 
ihas to say affects the way he says 
it — an example might be David 
Redd^s Sunbeam Caress, in this issue 
— and that seems reasonable to us. 
But that accounts for very little of 
the New Wave . and the rest 
seems to us to be an awful waste 
of inventiveness and ability.

T he humans were the ones who 
reawakened the dormant fires 
of the sun. They ventured from the 
surface of their world and tried to 
subdue the sun, in their attempts to 
control the weather of Earth. They 
did not realize they had failed until 
it was too late. 

After only a few decades, the in- 
exorable streams of solar radiation 
had done their work. The genetic 
damage was irreversible. Many 
species became extinct; others, like 
the ants and the humans, survived 
in altered forms. New species ap- 





pear^ in the changing landscapes, 
an appalling diversity of plants and 
animals bursting into life in the new 
tide of evolution. For the first time 
since the early days of creation, 
the distinction between plant and 
animal became meaningless. Was 
tumibleweed a plant or not? Was 
llitterdown a seed or an insect? The 
human biologists had a more ur- 
gent problem: survival of humanity. 

Beneath the seas, humanity sought 
shelter from the radiation. Water- 
Ineathing seamen toiled in their sub- 
nwine cities to save their race. The 
old air-breathing humans were be- 
yond help, but their successors the 
seamen had not given up hope. The 
Bcdentists discovered that the radi- 
ations came and went in cycles, 
warping the structure of Time and 
creating mirages of past and future. 
As the seamen too came under the 
pressures of evolution, they tried to 
project themselves into a future 
where they would have more chance 
of surviving until the radiation sub- 
sided. They vanished, leaving their 
homes empty, and no land human 
knew or cared whether they had 
succeeded or not. The air-breathing 
humans had forgotten that such 
things as seamen existed. 

On the warm tropical plains of 
the land once known as South 
America, the ants grew in both size 
and inteitlect. Their race mind be- 
came intelligent and extended its 
telepathic control to other races — 
including the agile brown creatures 
called men. The humans became the 
Racemind’s most valuable slaves, 
more important than even the dol- 
phins swimming captive in the moats 


and ilakes. The ants bred the huihahs 
scientifically to produce a new, more 
versatile race with telekinetic pow- 
ers such as levitation. The ants bred 
many animals on their farms, bring- 
ing back many creatures which had 
been extinct. 

While the human cities crumbled 
aiway, the ants built cities of their 
own. The tunnels and underground 
chambers were lined with tinted 
glass, for the ants loved the bright 
colors of gem-stones and similar ma- 
terials. The surface sections of their 
cities, the one-tenth built above 
ground, were constructed entirely 
of glass and gems, in every shade 
the glasswrights could produce in 
their roaring furnaces. The cities 
sparkled within their moats, gigantic 
jewels reflecting colored sunlight 
across the green plains. 

At night, when the new moon 
rose in the warm black sky, the ant 
scientists brought out their tele- 
scopes to survey the marvel on the 
darkened disk — the tiny star shin- 
ing in the lunar night. The ants 
could not know what it was, for 
their human slaves had forgotten. 
Up there on the moon, the lights 
were shining in the deserted atomic 
city. After twelve thousand years, 
the abandoned city was still waiting 
for its builders to return. 

II 

THE FIRST CONFRONTATION 

A s it awoke, the Racemind realized 
that it was not alone. After only 
two centuries, a serious crisis had 
developed. During this time^ the 


8 


IF 



Racemind had been building up a 
complex structure of philosophical 
thoi^t on the subject of immortali- 
ty; the entire cent^ command had 
l^n engaged on the task, leaving the 
duties of running civili^tion to a 
small semi-automatic co-ordination 
center. 

Transferring its musings to the 
dolphin memory cells, the Racemind 
reabsorbed the co-ordination center 
as the telepathic battle began. The 
record of the crisis was scanned in- 
stantly, and the Racemind took con- 
trol as thou^ it had handled the af- 
fair from the beginning. 

In an outlying western district of 
Land South-West, some small human 
children had decided to spend their 
free day in the foothills of the barren 
mountains. The farm commandant 
did not object to this unusual re- 
quest and let them go. The co-ordin- 
ation center monitored the events 
without interfering. The Racemind 
had a clear picture from the records: 
a V-formation of chubby brown 
creatures, each twenty times longer 
than the largest ant, floating into the 
hot morning air and gliding on their 
way, laughing as they went. Flying 
up a desert valley, the children saw 
a patch of pinldsh light on the 
orange-red stones in the distance. 
They chattered excitedly — humans 
still used vocal communication 
among themselves, despite the tele- 
pathic linkage imposed by the ants 
— and soared over the rocks to in- 
vestigate the strange light. As the 
children approached, the color of 
the light became clearer. It was com- 
ing from a group of creatures unlike 
anything the Racemind had seen. 


There were six of the creatures, 
six tapering columns of pale carmine 
Hght, each about four and a half 
feet tall. Their base diameter was 
one foot, but "dieir domed summits 
were less than half that width. No 
internal features were visible at all, 
nothing but the soft carmine light 
of their semi-transparent bodies 
shimmering in the heat-haze. The 
columns were drifting slowly down 
from the high mountains; their bases 
were just touching the veins of red- 
brown ore over which they were 
traveling, and rolling around the six 
columns was a ragged mob of tum- 
bleweed — plants which had pulled 
up their roots, curled their leaves in- 
to a rough sphere and become as 
mobile as any animal. The tumble- 
weed were circling the columns in a 
manner which suggested a definite 
relationship with them. 

A strange mental static was eman- 
ating from the li^ columns. It was 
far worse than anything from the 
war flowers, and the co-ordination 
center could feel its control of the 
children slipping. Waiting a moment 
longer to confirm that the situation 
was indeed serious, the co-ordination 
center roused the bulk of the Race- 
mind from its dreams of immortalitv. 
Then the Racemind took over. 

Somehow the columns were break- 
ing down the children’s conditioning. 
The Racemind strengthened the tele- 
pathic linkage ibetween Itself and the 
children, bypassing their individual 
responses and tak^g full control of 
their bodies. The mental static con- 
tinued. The columns were broad- 
casting strangely compelling thoughts 
of warmth and companionship.

tc-mpting the children to exercise the 
independent powers possessed 'by all 
humans. Already the children were 
questioning that the Raceanind was 
fitted to think for them — this des- 
pite the complete control the Race- 
mind had imposed on them. The 
Racemind countered the effect of 
the deconditioning impulses, but it 
was too late. The children’s brains 
had suffered permanent damage. 

The children were insane. The 
Racemind could do no more than 
direct them away from the light col- 
umns. By this time the scene was in- 
distinct — the distortions of the tele- 
pathic linkage were getting more 
severe — and it was almost a victory 
for the Racemind when the children 
began gliding back to their farm. Un- 
expectedly, the light columns made 
no attempt to follow up their success. 

The Racemind disposed of the 
damaged children in the nearest 
dream caverns; in their deranged 
state they were a danger to any nor- 
mal unit which approached them. 
The next logical steps were three in 
number. First, send an expendable 
unit into the hills to search for the 
origin of the light columns. Second, 
check through the accumulated 
memories of the past two centuries. 
These columns were an entirely new 
form of life, and the Racemind want- 
ed to see what else evolution had 
produced in recent years. Third, pre- 
pare a fully equipped expedition to 
explore the mountains. TTie first of 
these three was relatively simple: the 
Racemind selected a young human 
mural-designer from the town near 
Idle children’s farm. She was a sterile 
female who made a hobby of biology. 


Ill 

THE QUEST BEGINS 

T he humans were allowed a high 
degree of individuality by the 
ants. The designer, who called her- 
self Rrengyara in the symbolic spok- 
en language used by the humans 
among themselves, had spent much 
of her free time studying the crea- 
tures of her district. The information 
so gained was stored in her own 
brain without being absorbed in the 
Racemind’s memory units. Only the 
humans could amass individual 
knowledge in this way. But now in- 
dividuality had progressed too far. 
The children had begun to disobey 
the Racemind’s conditioning. The 
gravity of the situation disturbed the 
Racemind, therefore it disturbed 
Rrengyara. She prayed to the distant 
ant queens that her mission might 
be successful. She did not pray for 
a safe return, for in this mission her 
death would be unimportant as long 
as the Racemind gained new inform- 
ation from her joUmey. And the 
Racemind had abolished fear of 
death long ago. 

The first peril was entirely unex- 
pected. Rrengyara was above the 
foothills, flying over the last of the 
farms, when she received an impres- 
sion that something was wrong. She 
looked down. 

The farm was busy this warm 
afternoon. Ant local-control observ- 
ers and relay units stood on their 
pillars, supervising all that went on. 
Humans were harvesting the com, 
pigs were plowing up some fallow 
Eelds, titanemoles were digging the 




IF 







foundations for a new barn. Diplo- 
doci were grazing behind the lake. 
In their pens the gelatinous slumber- 
ers rolled about, like jellyfish search- 
ing for the sea. Opossums were pick- 
ing fruit in the orchard, and a lean 
jaguar was watching over the herd 
of tiny struthomimi. All was as it 
should be. 

The thoughts came whispering into 
hei* mind again, Down below, the 
farm workers paused. At that mo- 
ment the ant observers sent out a 
message: “Local outbreak of war 
flowers. Request assistance.” 

In the hedges, sinister cobalt blue 
petals were unfolding. As the flowers 
appeared, Rrengyara’s thoughts be- 
gan dancing at random. The normal- 
ly subdued irrational impulses in her 
mind were being intensified by the 
empathetic weeds springing up on 
the farm below. The workers fused 
their minds in a compulsive group- 
solidarity rhythm — the only de- 
fence against the war flowers. If 
they could not defeat the madness 
from the flowers, their conditioning 
would fail and they would start 
fighting each other. The animals not 
controlled by the Racemind were af- 
fected more severely. 

This deadly empathy from the war 
flowers was a by-product of their 
reproductive process: their seeds 
were fertilized by telepathic impulses 
from other war flowers which initi- 
ated autosurgical operations on the 
reproductive cells. The Racemind 
could not predict where these plants 
would appear next, for they sent 
out sprays of tiny, almost weightless 
seeds which could remain dormant 
for centuries. All the seeds from one 


plant germinated at the same time, 
regardless of external conditions^ 

Perhaps war flowers were respon- 
sible for the children’s aberrations, 
thought Rrengyara. As she formed 
the idea, the Racemind took full con- 
trol of her body and sent her speed- 
ing away from the farm and the war 
flowers. She had been more seriously 
affected by the flowers than she 
thought. The Racemind would not 
have sent her to hunt for the carmine 
light columns if the children’s ex- 
perience had any normal explanation. 

Soaring over the sloping rocky 
ground, rising up to the high moun- 
tains, Rrengyara prayed to her deities 
— the ant queens — that the squads 
of rescue units would reach the farm 
in time. The Racemind was slowly 
winning the battle to exterminate the 
war flowers, but it had received 
many setbacks. Far too often the 
survivors of an outbreak were fit for 
nothing but the dream caverns. That 
was ironic, although the Racemind 
could not appreciate it, for in the 
caverns those who came to die were 
devoured by relatives of the war 
flowers. One of the earliest empath- 
etic plants had been carnivorous, en- 
veloping its prey in a crimson cloud 
of pleasure. The ants had taken this 
plant, adapted it to their own speci- 
flcatioos and sown it in the cool 
gardens of the dream caverns; be- 
cause the ants were determined that 
no unit should die in pain — without 
due cause. 

R rengyara glided on, higher and 
higher. Up here the rocks were 
almost bare of life, and the only 
things which moved were the ever- 


12 


IF 



present airborne fluffballs of flitter- 
dowB. These were little white spheres 
less than a finger’s length in diame- 
ter, drifting about on the convection 
currents or darting to and fro around 
each other. She saw a round green 
tumbleweed, but it was pre-adole- 
scent and still firmly rooted to the 
ground. Cacti could be seen through 
the heat->haze. This dry, almost life- 
less valley, with no cultivated fields 
te break the monotony of its orange- 
red stones, was the place where the 
children had encountered the car- 
mine light columns. 

She started flying up towards the 
head of the valley, where it ended 
in a pass between two mountain 
walls. She moved from side to side 
in a standard search pattern. 

At the pass she halted and hovered 
above the ridge, looking down into 
the new valley beyond. It was as arid 
and as empty as the valley she had 
just checked. On her right were the 
cliffs of the high plateau, a wind- 
swept desert region formed by the 
now-extinct volcanoes. No unit had 
been to the plateau since the earliest 
days of the ant civilization. HoWever, 
the valley in front of her had been 
visited more recently. She had spent 
a (free day there herself once, study- 
ing the plants. Her most iiiteresting 
discovery had been the mountain 
glass poppies, which focused sunlight 
on the central seed boxes to hasten 
the ripening process. 

She could go down to the valley, 
or up to the plateau. Much of the 
valley was visible from her present 
position, but no carmine light could 
be seen. The Racemind ordered her 
to search the plateau. 


She rose up alongside the near- 
vertical cliff faces, watching the 
brown stones for any movement 
which might indicate a landslip. The 
sharp protruding edges, and the rub- 
ble on the valley floor, showed that 
these tall cliffs were not as firm as 
they appeared. Hundreds pf feet 
above the pass, sihe reached the pla- 
teau. Here the landscape formed a 
scene as bizarre as any ruined human 
city. Brown, red, purple, orange, the 
crags sprang up from the featureless 
rock of the plateau floor. The out- 
crops had been eroded into fantastic 
shapes by constant weathering, 
sculptured into turrets and arches 
and ramparts of bright flame-colored 
stone. The heat-haze made every- 
thing indistinct to her"wision, giving 
her the impression she was flying 
over a forest of living rocks that 
were breathing slowly in the hot sun. 
At the same time the scene had the 
strange clarity of a time-mirage. 

If it had not been for the Race- 
mind’s control she would have be- 
come lost within minutes. The un- 
controlled human brain was too in- 
efficient to memorize the configura- 
tions of this landscape’s red-brown 
battlements and towers. If the light 
columns were here, they could re- 
main hidden from a ground army for 
years, as the Racemind had known 
when it selected a flying scout for 
the mission. 

Rrengyara levitated forward, gain- 
ing height to take in a wider view 
of the ground. In the heat-haze, it 
seemed as though the rocks were ar- 
ranged in lines like the wave-crests 
of a sea. But the real sea was blue, 
and the only blue in this jungle of 


SUNBEAM CARESS 


13 



stone was that of the sky above. 
Even the cobalt blue of a war flower 
would have been welcome. 

Gliding slowly above these natural 
fortifications, her naked brown body 
sweating in the heat of the after- 
noon calm, Rrengyara scanned the 
rocks for any living thing, light 
column or more familiar creature. 
Once she glimpsed a patch of dark 
green, and swooped down to see 
some cacti beneath a natural arch. 
A lone flitterdown bush grew out of 
a crevice, and a few lichens and 
stonecrops clung to the boulders. 
These and the occasional flitterdown 
ball were all she saw. 

Presently she came to a region of 
higher ground, where the crags were 
so large as to be termed small hills. 
Here the rocks had black shadows 
in various places — the openings of 
caves. She descended to examine one. 
The Racemind informed her that the 
caves had been found before, when 
the early explorers were crossing the 
plateau. The caves were probably 
volcanic tunnels formed by escaping 
gases, although the explorers had 
not made any detailed studies to 
confirm this. If the light columns 
were hiding in the caves, Rrengyara 
could do nothing about it. The ex- 
pedition now being prepared would 
bring suitable equipment for explor- 
ing the caves. 

IV 

SUNBEAM RITUAL 

W hen she soared upwards from 
examining the cave openings, 
Rrengyara saw a small growing point 


in the heat-haze ahead. It had been 
hidden from her before by a curv- 
ing shoulder of rock. She dropped 
down again and floated low over the 
ground, using the outcrops as cover. 
A point of light that did not beloi^ 
here had to ibe artifida]. If living 
creatures were over there, Rrengyara 
wanted to prevent them seeing her. 
She must not suffer the fate of the 
children too soon. 

Floating round one of the last 
crags, she caught sight of a lime- 
green light near her destination. The 
quality of the light suggested that 
here was a being like those the chil- 
dren had encountered. From then 
on Rrengyara stopped levitating and 
covered the rest of the ground nor- 
mally. Where possible she walked, 
but most of the time she crawled. 
After passing a large cave mouth she 
saw that green luminescence again. 
She ducked back (behind the cave en- 
trance, hoping the creature had not 
seen her. The Racemind did not 
know what perceptive senses the light 
columns possessed. She listened and 
heard nothing. She crawled from the 
cave towards a small outcrop. Hot 
air was rising beyond the crest of the 
rock, in some quantity. As she 
crawled over she looked forward, ex- 
pecting to see a fire. Instead, she saw 
a huge transparent crystal with a 
ball of yellow fire at its center. A 
large tumbleweed rolled into view. 
She wriggled hastily on behind the 
cover of the outcrop and lay in the 
shadow, trying to think whether a 
crystal like that could exist naturally 
on this plateau. It had been four- 
sided, with flat top and bottom, and 
it was covered with small abrasions 


14 


IF 



and places where pieces had flaked 
off. Five feet high, and nearly two 
feet thick, it had been completely 
colorless except for that patch of 
yellow inside it — and that could 
have been a reflection of the sun. 

The Racemind told her that the 
crystal had not been there when the 
original explorers visited the plateau. 
Furthermore, there had been no tum- 
bleweed on the plateau in those days. 
The Racemind made Rrengyara 
stand up to look at the crystal, the 
tumbleweed and the light column. 

The lime-green column was there, 
a pillar of light nine feet high with 
a base two feet across. It was trans- 
parent, but no internal organs were 
visible. Rrengyara only glanced at 
the light column, for before her was 
a circle of crystals. Each crystal was 
colorless, transparent and six-faced, 
the same size as the first she had 
seen.- There were thirteen of them, 
spaced evenly round the circumfer- 
ence of a circle twenty feet in dia- 
meter. The crystals were leaning over 
at various angles, arranged so that 
they focused the sunlight on the cir- 
cular patch of ground inside the ring 
of crystals. The glowing light Rren- 
gyara had seen was at the center of 
the circle, where the ground was 
melting and bubbling in the concen- 
trated sunlight. Rrengyara could feel 
the heat sinking into her face. Thir- 
teen scorched grooves on the rock, 
along curved lines stretching from 
the crystals to the central furnace, 
showed that previously the crystals 
had been set to focus the sunlight 
on paths leading from each crystal 
to the center. The Racemind realized 
that the pattern being burnt into the 


stone resembled the dancing grounds 
constructed by primitive peoples for 
religious ceremonies. The only prim- 
itives the Racemind knew had de- 
generated from more advanced 
states, but that did not affect the 
validity of the comparison. 

Circling the ring of crystals was a 
shoal of whirling tumbleweed, roll- 
ing and bouncing through the heat- 
haze. Their frenzied movements con- 
trasted with the complete stillness of 
the crystals. To one side stood the 
cool green column of light, watching 
over the tumbleweed and crystals 
like a benevolent child-guardian. 

R rengyara saw all this in an in- 
stant. She threw herself back 
down again ‘behind the outcrop, hid- 
ing her dark body in the shadow. 
The heat-sensitive tumbleweed might 
have detected her, or the light col- 
umn might have sensed her presence 
in some way. The feeling of peace, 
brotherhood and security from the 
light column was plucldng at her 
mind and growing in intensity. The 
Racemind ordered her to remain in 
her present position, to test the col- 
umn’s reaction to an intruder. 

When it became clear that Rrengy- 
ara had not been seen, the Racemind 
ordered her to stand up again. Her 
attention was caught by a familiar- 
looking patch of colored light far 
over to the right of the circle. This 
was what the children had seen. It 
was a group of carmine light col- 
umns, made small by distance, trav- 
eling on a course which would take 
them near the crystal circle. If they 
continued moving in this direction 
they would see her. She had to move

back, out of range. That cave she 
had seen earlier would make a good 
refuge. 

fiSie levitated hurriedly across the 
stretch of open ground, gliding less 
than a foot above the dusty stones. 
At the entrance to the cave she 
paused and looked hack for any 
signs of pursuit. Nothing happened. 
Apparently the tumbleweed and the 
light column were absorbed in their 
own affairs. 

Satisfied that she had not been 
sighted, Rrengyara floated into the 
dark mouth of the cave. 

In the black depths before her she 
could see hundreds of tiny specks 
of light. The faintly greenish tinge 
to the white radiance indicated the 
presence of radioactive minerals. The 
objects came nearer. Rrengyara saw 
a moving cloud of small phospho- 
rescent crystals, flying up out of the 
darkness. The luminous crystals were 
streaking towards her like male fire- 
flies homing on a female. The horde 
was almost upon her — 

Contact was broken, and the Race- 
mind knew that it had lost Rrengy- 
ara. The crystals had killed her. 

V 

VISIONS IN THE HEAT-HAZE 

T he data from Rrengyara’s last 
journey was integrated with the 
information the Racemind was gath- 
ering from its memories of the last 
two centuries. It was one more piece 
of evidence to show that the world 
had been changing while the Race- 
mind was dreaming of immortality. 
The most important change was 


in the climate. Previously the worlds 
mean temperature bad been rising 
in what appeared to be a straight- 
forward linear progression. Now, 
however, the increase in temperature 
had departed sufficiently from the 
predicted values for the Racemind 
to see that the progression was in 
fact logarithmic. The steadily rising 
level of solar radiation was heating 
up the world more quickly than the 
Racemind had anticipated. 

Evolution was also progressing. 
The pallid slumberers, creatures com- 
posed of gelatin within a tough 
chitinous hide, were diversifying 
rapidly. Several new species were 
now in regular use on the farms, 
having been domesticated without 
difficulty. The slumberers were not 
the only animals to evolve in this 
way. The mutation rate had not in- 
creased greatly, but the new muta- 
tions contained a far lower percent- 
age of genetic undesirables than be- 
fore. The work of the breeders had 
more than doubled in the efforts to 
adapt these new species for service 
under the Racemind. Also, unusually 
large numbers of fish were leaving 
the sea and attempting to live on the 
shore. Fish had been trying to recol- 
onize the land since the last Ice Age, 
when the Racemind was still young, 
but there had never been this many 
before. 

In the large island which had been 
one of the last outposts of human 
land civilization — the humans still 
called it by its old name, Malagash 
— a social evolution had taken place 
among a rare spvecies of bird. Many 
centuries ago the breeders had re- 
created the extinct hummingbirds to 


16 


IF 



act as weavers. These birds were 
amaU, brightly colored and fast^mov- 
ing. They us^ their long beaks to 
sew large leaves together to form 
edible plates and other utensils. The 
hummingbirds still served the ants, 
but now they were living in colonies 
•f organized societies like communal 
insects. They were building intricate 
structures of leaves in the dense jun- 
gle, in imitation of the ant cities. 
Their numbers were increasing, so 
their work for the ants had not suf- 
fered even though nearly a quarter of 
the hummingbird population was 
working in the tree cities. The most 
interesting aspect of the change was 
the complex organization which now 
dealt with hatching the eggs and 
bringing up the young humming- 
birds. 

Other birds had changed too. The 
sandlings were small flightless birds 
living on the edge of the desert in 
Land North-East. They had started 
burrowing underground, in sand al- 
ready stiffened by the concretelike 
trails of the brickworms, strength- 
ening their tunnels with a mixture 
of sand and saliva. As yet these 
burrows were made by individuals 
and there was no indication that the 
sandlings might develop communal 
activities as the hummingbirds had 
done. 

The isolated minor continent, 
kn^wn to the ancient humans as 
Australia, produced a phenomenon 
which had no rational explanation. 
The small scattered ant colonies 
there reported that within the last 
few years the annual migration of 
the various animals had included a 
new routine. Herds of sheep, kanga- 


roos, stegosauri, humans, dogs and 
other animals were wandering in cir- 
cles round the great boneyards where 
the uncontrolled creatures came to 
die. Each individual animal circled 
the boneyard several times, taking 
as long as a fortnight to do so, be- 
fore it departed to resume its in- 
terrupted migration. This meant that 
at any given time there were several 
thousand creatures slowly travelling 
round each iboneyard. This did not 
interfere with the program of trans- 
forming the deserts into fertile plains, 
but the ritual’s absence of purpose 
was puzzling. 

There was another problem on the 
island continent, one which had near- 
ly caused the little co-ordination cen- 
ter to arouse the Racemind before it 
became clear there was no danger to 
the ant civilization. The humans of 
this near-desert territory were black- 
skinned giants who had lost the in- 
telligence retained by the ants’ other 
human slaves. However, the giants 
were now regaining the mental pow- 
ers lost when they reverted to ani- 
mals. They were clearing away the 
rubble over the old dancing grounds 
and once more bowing to sacred 
stones erected by the salt pans. The 
giants were booming intelligent 
again. 

U ndersea expeditions continued 
uncovering the remains of the 
submarine cities buried in the ooze. 
These buildings were the homes of 
the now-extinct seamen, the water- 
breathers who had been the last in- 
dependent intelligent humans. The 
Racemind had given priority to this 
archeological project because it want- 


SUNBEAM CARESS 


17 



ed to study the differences between 
land and underwater civilizations. If 
it had been capable of emotion it 
would have been dismayed wben tbe 
current situation reached its con- 
sciousness from the memory unittfi " 
Oonditions at the excavations were 
growing steadily worse, and one site 
had been abandoned. The ruined 
cities had been invaded by shapeless 
monsters feeding on the disturbed 
ooze and effluent from the living 
quarters. These monsters were com- 
plexes of cloudy white cells, resem- 
bling masses of sponge rubber or 
soap foam. Normally the cell com- 
plexes rested quietly on the sea bed, 
absorbing nourishment from the ooze 
beneath them and dividing in two on 
reaching a certain size. Now they too 
had changed, and when they invaded 
the archeological sites they were able 
to feed and grow without dividing. 
They smothered the excavations, and 
if some cells were tom loose from 
their sides the fragments started 
growing to form new cell complexes. 
As soon as an area was clea^ of 
them, others drifted in and rein- 
fested the area. The archeological 
work was slowing down, and far few- 
er relics were being brought to the 
surface. 

The Racemind was accustomed to 
living in a world of change; its civil- 
ization was fluids based on the prin- 
ciple that creatures did not always 
breed true. Genetics was the most 
important science to the ants. The 
Racemind’s thought over the last two 
centuries had been, in feict, mainly 
concerned with the question of how 
adaptable an entity coiild afford to 
be, in order to retain its identity in 


a constantly dianging environment. 
But the present situaidon was dearly 
too much. The Racemind had exam- 
ined less than half its accumulated 
memories, but already it knew that 
evolution, like the world’s tempera- 
ture, was progressing along a loga- 
lithi^c curve. It was all due to the 
present solar radiation cycle, the 
worst since the Ice Age ended. 

A minor hy-^product of the intense 
solar radiation was the series of time- 
mirages. These were scenes or ob- 
jects from the past, visible through 
local distortions of the space-time 
continuum caused by interaction of 
the solar radiation with the earth’s 
natural radiation field. The strangest 
objects seen through these warps 
were the giant flying disks or cross- 
^ which the old humans had used 
for air transport. Unit^ sometimes 
tried to fly up to the aircraft in 
the time-mirages, but it was no more 
successful than chasing a rainbow. 
The Racemind had found that a 
prolonged series of time-mirages in- 
variably preceded another burst of 
evolutionary progress. 

While Rrengyara was exploring 
the plateau, more units in Land 
South-West were falling away into 
individualism and pugnacity under 
the influence of the war flowers. 
Fresh outbreaks were occurring, but 
the Racemind could control them. 
Units stationed to keep watch for 
light columns were helping win the 
struggle against the deadly cobalt 
blue flowers. 

As for the light columns them- 
selves, they were obviously a com- 
pletely new form of life which had 
evolved up on the plateau. ^ Their 


18 


IF 









appearance brought a whole new 
realm of uncertainty into the classi- 
fication of living organisms. Pre- 
viously the main difficulty had been 
in distinguishing between plant and 
animal. For instance, the foamlike 
cell complexes now invading the sub- 
marine excavations could fit into 
either category. Again, the flitter- 
down bush was definitely a plaint, 
but its fluffy seed had an insectoidal 
body hidden inside whose long white 
hairs, although normally only the 
eyes were visible. The li^t columns, 
however, were neither plant nor ani- 
mal. As far as the Racemind knew, 
the columns did not have a physical 
cellular structure at all. 

The columns had destroyed the 
conditioning in several units and 
had established control over the 
tumbleweed. (The image of the tum- 
bleweed circling the crystals resem- 
bled the image of the Australian 
animals circling a boneyard. Was 
this a coincidence? The Racemind 
did not possess enough data to de- 
cide.) Had the columns anything 
to do with the death of Rrengyara? 
Something had launched those tiny 
crystals at her inside the cave. Cer- 
tainly there was a connection be- 
tween the light columns, the tum- 
bleweed and the large crystals — 
although the Racemind did not im- 
derstand why the crystals had been 
set to scorch that thirteen-limbed 
pattern into the rook. 

The killing of Rrengyara was an- 
other matter. Something had intend- 
ed to silence the intruder, and for 
that reason alone the Racemind was 
justified in continuing its investi- 
gations. 


VI 

THE QUEST CONTINUES 

T he expedition consisted of fifty 
flying ants, twenty-two bumiains 
and twenty-four fruit bats — ninety- 
six units in all. It was entirely air- 
borne, because flying units possessed 
greater mobility ithan ground forces. 
The ants were present in sufficient 
numbers to protect themselves and 
the other units from any decondi- 
tioning attempts the light columns 
might make. The humans were the 
pack animals, carrying the equip- 
ment, and they also provided force 
to counter any physical attack on the 
other units. The fruit bats, beauti- 
ful creatures with smooth black fur, 
were the scouts and would do most 
of the reconnaissance work. 

As always, it was hot and sunny 
in the mountains. To the units in 
the expedition it seemed hotter than 
in the lowlands, despite the altitude. 
They soared up from the dry valley 
and reached the rocky plateau where 
Rrengyara had been lost. The strange 
outcrops stretched away before them 
in the heat-haze: brown and purple 
pillars, great orange-red rocks re- 
sembling the figures of plants or 
animals, purple crags like fangs bit- 
ing into the sky, a natural arch with 
orange and brown curving across in 
lines like the colors of a rainbow, 
all these weird sculptures and thou- 
sands more were spread out all over 
the plateau. 

The scout units of the expedition, 
the fruit bats, spread out to cover 
a wide stretch of territory as the ex- 
pedition flew on towards the circle 


20 


IF 



of crystals. The Racemind was con- 
trolling all the units, allowing the 
humans no individuality. Rrengyara 
had been left partially controlled, a 
tempting target for any telepathic 
attack, but as yet there was no 
need to repeat the experiment. 

They sighted the .flitterdown bush 
Rrengyara had seen. Some balls of 
flitterdown, which had followed the 
expedition up from the lowlands, 
dived towards the bush with faint 
supersonic squeaks of delight. 

A little further on, a fruit bat 
on the extreme left of the crescent 
formation saw something which had 
been hidden from Rrengyara by a 
high spur of rock. Some chameleon 
cacti were growing in a dusty hol- 
low. They were not matching the 
orange-brown of their surroundings. 
Instead, each cactus was slowly 
changing color. The fruit bat drop- 
ped behind his companions to study 
the plants’ imusual 'behavior. The 
color-cycle was the same for each 
cactus, but the plants were going 
through the cycle at different time 
rates. The effect was that the fruit 
bat could see all the stages in the 
cycle at the same time. Two of the 
colors were familiar to the Race- 
mind: carmine and lime green. The 
rest of the series included two more 
citrus colors, orange and lemon yel- 
low, and a very pale blue. White was 
in the cycle, but black was absent. 

The Racemind sent the fruit bat 
flying on to rejoin the expedition. 
There was nothing more to see here 
at the moment. The incident was 
another illustration of the strange 
power the light columns possessed 
over lesser creatures. In some way 


t^ie columns had disrupted the nor- 
mal protective-coloration mechanism 
of the cacti, substituting this rhyth- 
mic cycle of colors. 

B efore the fruit bat returned to 
its position in the formation, 
another fruit bat near the center 
of the orescent saw a lemon yellow 
column standing on the rocks ahead. 
The fruit bat sped forward ahead of 
the others, but the yellow column 
grew fainter and fainter. It faded 
away into nothing, leaving only the 
purple stones and the ever-present 
heat-haze. The expedition searched 
4he area diligently without finding 
so much as a cave the yellow column 
could have slipped into. There was 
no explanation for its disappearance. 
Finally the Racemind abandoned the 
search and sieat the expedition on 
to the point where Rrengyara had 
died. A flying ant was left to keep 
watch should the lemon-yellow col- 
umn reappear. 

The expedition arrived at the cir- 
cle of tall transparent crystals dis- 
covered by Rrengyara. Changes had 
taken place in the circle, so a couple 
of units went forward to examine it 
while the rest descended to the 
ground near the cave. The expedi- 
tion reached the dark cave mouth 
without trouble and sent in two 
scouts, a fruit bat carrying a normal 
torch followed by a flying ant see- 
ing by infrared light. Should the 
fruit bat be attacked the ant be- 
hind him would see what happened 
even if telepathic contact with the 
victim was broken. 

The fruit bat entered the cave, 
the white light from its luminous- 


SUNBEAM CARESS 


21 



plankton torch seeming pale and dim 
in the blackness. The curved sides of 
the cave had cracked and split, send- 
ing little splinters of rock to the 
floor, so that the walls contained 
thousands of tiny ledges and the 
floor was strewn with stones resem- 
bling pine needles. Curiously enough 
the roof was still intact. 

Rrengyara’s body had gone, but 
the 'Stone splinters were coated with 
blood at the spot where she had 
been standing. Beyond the brown 
stains, a faint milky glow was vis- 
ible in the darkness. The faint green- 
ish tinge to the light was familiar. 
The fruit bat glided on; the Race- 
mind intended to trigger whatever 
weapons launch^ the attack on 
Rrengyara. Thousands of minute 
cr5T^tals, all flat and none larger than 
half an inch across, were resting on 
the ledges and cracks in the walls, 
like a flock of seabirds nesting on 
a cliff. Here the crystals covered 
the sides of the cave so thickly that 
•their light was brighter than that of 
the fruit bat’s torch. The flying ant 
reported that the cave crystals were 
radiating infrared light in addition 
to the normal visible spectrum. The 
attack never came. The crystals re- 
mained motionless on their ledges, 
glowing balefully, while the fruit bat 
passed through the zone of light. 

After the region occupied by the 
phosphorescent crystals, the cave 
branched in two. Both openings 
were equally dark. The fruit bat 
flew along the left-hand tunnel and 
soon discovered a second greenish- 
white glow ahead. Turning a cor- 
ner, he saw that the cave widened 
into a subterranean chamber and 


then came to a dead end. The floor 
of the chamber was partially con- 
cealed by a shallow pool of milky 
liquid which appeared to be evapor- 
ating, judging by the white stain 
around the depression in the floor. 
The opaque luminous liquid was 
dripping slowly into the pool from 
a group of stalactites, the first such 
formations the Racemind had seen 
in these caves. The small pond was 
not the only source of the greenish- 
white light; clusters of crystals were 
huddled together on the ledges 
around the pool. These crystals were 
glistening as if damp. They had 
only just been formed, the Racemind 
realized. In its own laboratories the 
Racemind made crystals by this same 
process — evaporation of a saturated 
solution. 

T he fruit bat did not take speci- 
mens, because the cave would 
receive a thorough investigation from 
the rest of the expedition. He flew 
back along the tunnel to the junc- 
tion, where the flying ant awaited 
him, and turned left to explore the 
other fork. Quite suddenly, the tun- 
nel came to an end. The fruit bat 
shone his torch around and saw a 
pile of small colorless objects which 
looked life fish scales. He dropped 
to the floor to examine them. They 
were little diamond-shaped crystals, 
so flat as to be almost two-dimen- 
sional, identical to the others in 
the caves except that they were not 
glowing. The light had gone out of 
them, and they were transparent, 
like the little disks of horn the 
human children played with. The 
crystals were dead.

IF 



Meanwhile, the two flying ants 
studied the circle of large crystals. 
No light columns were present, and 
the shoal of tumbleweed had van- 
ished, so the two units could ap- 
proach the circle in safety. 

The pattern scorched into the rock 
by the crystals was now complete 
and had cooled into solidity again. 
In shape it resembled an octopuslike 
creature with thirteen arms, or a 
symbolic representation of the sun. 
The circular central area, which 
Rrengyara had seen in the process 
of formation, was about four feet 
in diameter. The thirteen paths, curv- 
ing from the center of the paatern 
out to the circumference, were each 
two feet wide and about nine feet 
long. The region where they overlap- 
ped enlarged the central area. 

The huge colorless crystals were 
no longer at the outer rim of the 
circular pattern. Twelve of them 
were positioned ait regular intervals 
along the grooved pathways leading 
to the center, and the thirteenth 
crystal was actually at the center. 
The twelve on the pathways were ar- 
ranged in lines of four; in each 
group the innermost crystal was close 
to the center, the outermost was near 
the perimeter, and the two others 
occupied inteitmediate positions on 
their respective gtooves. Each path- 
way was occupied by one crystal, ex- 
cept for the thirteenth which was 
empty. 

The lone crystal in the middle was 
off-center. The Racemind continued 
watching, and presently it realized 
that the crystals were moving. They 
were gradually inching along the 
paths they had burnt into the stone. 


The Racemind made an intuitive 
correlation. This scorch-pattern was 
a dancing ground, similar to the 
sites the giant black humans were 
rebuilding in Australia. This slow 
motion of the crystals was a reli- 
gious ceremony. They were dragging 
themselves along the grooves for a 
definite purpose. 

The Racemind knew that ordinary 
inanimate stones could wander across 
deserts by themselves, but this ritual 
was different. No inanimate object 
could think for itself in this way. 
These crystals were alive. 

If this assumption was correct, 
it confirmed the Racemind’s new 
theory that the cave crystals were 
living creatures. The Racemind’s 
thought processes were such that it 
would not have reached this con- 
clusion from only one set of data. 
However, the information from the 
cave and the circle formed two sets 
of data, and the knowledge that one 
entirely new life form — the light 
columns — had already appeared 
formed a third set. In the circum- 
stances the Racemind had to as- 
sume — temporarily, at least — that 
the crystals were alive. Were the 
crystals subject to group-mentality 
control like other creatures? What 
was their relationship with the light 
columns? Had the large crystals 
made their dancing ground of their 
own volition. If the cave crystals 
had killed Rrengyara, why had they 
let the fruit bat explore the cave 
in safety? To these and other ques- 
tions the Racemind conceived sever- 
al possible answers, filing them away 
to be checked later when further 
data became available.

vn 

THE ZERO MOMENT 

I t was growing late, and the ex- 
pedition had ‘been travelling all 
day. The Racetmind decided to make 
camp for the night now and start 
work early in the morning, rather 
than continue in the hour or so of 
sunlight that remained. The temper- 
ature had fallen considerably, and 
the units wouild work better tomor- 
row if the routine preparations were 
finished before sundown. If any 
scientific investigations were started 
now everything would be hurried, 
overstraining the units which would 
then be functioning below full effi- 
ciency. So the only other work done 
that evening was a thorough but 
fruitless search of the immediate 
vicinity for Rrengyara’s body. 

While all this was taking place, 
most of the Racemind’s gigantic 
mental resources were still devoted 
to the incredible task of examining 
the memories of events which had 
occurred during the past two cen- 
turies. The Racemind had no equiv- 
alent of the concept “error” — to it, 
everything was classified in three 
categories: advantageous, non-advan- 
tageous and irrelevant — but the 
time spent dreaming of immortality 
had been decidedly non-advanta- 
geous, the Racemind realized, par- 
ticularly when considered with other 
activities such as the way civiliza- 
tion had remained within its present 
borders for thousands of years. If the 
Racemind had possessed the ability 
to indulge in masochistic hindsight, 
it would have told itself it should 


have sent regular exploring teams 
into unoccupied lands to see what 
new species were evolving there. As 
k was, the Racemind imerely decided 
to send out such expeditions in fu- 
ture. Perhaps the crystals and light 
columns had their counterparts on 
other continents. 

The units were bedding down for 
the night on the pleteau when the 
Racemind discovered an extremely 
significant item of information in 
its memories. Included in an annual 
report from a museum — an arche- 
ological storehouse and study center 
— was the statement that the rev- 
olution-counters in a certain ex- 
hibit had reached zero. 

The exhibit in question contained 
devices which had been found three 
thousand years ago in a well-pre- 
served submarine city. The revolu- 
tion-counters had been working per- 
fectly, recording the passage of years 
towards a certain date in the future. 
That date had arrived three weeks 
ago, and it coincided with the great- 
est concentration of time-mirages re- 
corded before or since. 

T he sea city in which the revolu- 
tion-counters were found con- 
tained other items. In it the ex- 
plorers gathered enough evidence to 
prove that the seamen had made a 
last desperate attempt to save their 
race. They had tried to project them- 
selves into the future via the time- 
mirages. 

The Racemind, knowing the cur- 
rent frequency of time-mirages and 
the weakened state of the space-time 
continuum, was certain that the revo- 
lution-counters had been program- 


24 


IF 



vm 


med to gj.ve the date of their arrival 
in the futiiie. The r^olution-coiinter 
was one of many electrometallic 
and mechanometalHc devices found 
in the sea cities. Several other sea- 
human inventions were stored away 
where they could do no damage, 
but most the large machines still 
in operation were left in position — 
the Raoemind had once lost several 
million units when attempting to re- 
move a machine from a deserted 
city. After some early disasters, the 
Racemind stopped all research into 
atomics, electrics and technology, 
permitting only simple and easily 
controlled devices to be used in its 
civilization. Thus the Racemind lack- 
ed sufficient information to take any 
action over the news about the revo- 
lution-counters. So now it had to 
obtain that information, quickly. 
Some seafarmers living near the site 
of the city in question were directed 
to investigate. The city had been 
closed for centuries, but the Race- 
mind had no hesitation in opening 
it again. If the seamen had succeeded 
in transmitting themselves through 
time, or if the abandoned machines 
had been programmed to reactivate 
themselves when the revolution- 
counters reached zero, there would 
be tremendous consequences for civ- 
ilization. 

The zero moment had arrived, 
and new life forms were appearing 
from nowhere; the two facts might 
well be connected* The seamen were 
an ingenious race, and in many ways 
it was surprising that they were ex- 
tinct. The Racemind sent the sea- 
farmers toward the submarine dty 
at maximum speed. 


FOCUS 

D uring the night, a tall, slender 
column of pure white light drift- 
ed past the sleeping imits in their 
camp. The guards on duty received 
strange thought impressions similar 
to the first stages of war-flower mad- 
ness. The Racemind roused the en- 
tire expedition to make a mental 
attack on the white column. The 
barrage of mentsd force had no effect 
on the colunm. The humans made a 
direct physical attack; this too failed. 
An invisible shield prevented the 
humans from reaching the intruder. 
The barrier genuinely existed; no 
conditioning had been imposed on 
the units. The white column had sur- 
rounded itself with an impenetrable 
cylinder of force. The Racemind sent 
some units after it, shadowing it to 
the cave entrance where it went into 
the opening. When they tried to 
follow the column they found an- 
other invisible barrier across the cave 
mouth. The white column had sealed 
up the cave. 

Two units remained by the en- 
trance all nighit, watching for the 
white column and periodically test- 
ing the barrier, but the situation was 
unchanged in the morning. The ex- 
pedition could not enter the cave 
again, so the Racemind continued its 
exploration of the plateau. The 
scouts discovered several more plan- 
tations of chameleon cacti, and the 
Racemind noted that all the plants 
were bowing gently towards the 
northern hills as they went through 
their column-inspired rainbow color-

cycles. No light columns of any col- 
or were found. 

A fruit bat on routine reconnais- 
sance in the dull brown xK>rtheim 
wastes was flying in the )direcdQn 
indicated by the chameleon cacti 
when he discovered the crater. Blue 
water sparkled within the great cir- 
cular depression, but that huge vol- 
canic cone had not contained a lake 
when the Racemind last visited the 
plateau. The fruit bat flew on, and 
approaching the crater he saw rows 
of cacti and tumbleweed, growing in 
straight lines which radiated out- 
ward from the crater lake like the 
spokes of a wheel. The arrangement 
was obviously artificial. Swooping 
low, the fruit bat saw that the brown 
rocks were covered in places 'by a 
thin layer of soil. The dusty earth 
had blowm about in the wind and 
collected in drifts on which sparse 
grass and small weeds were estab- 
lishing themselves. The ground 
around the cacti and tumbleweed was 
free of other plants. The lake was 
hidden from the ground by the 
high ramparts of the crater rim. 

Rising again, the fruit bat soared 
towards the lake in the old extinct 
volcano. He was alone, for the other 
scout units had spread out in all 
directions searching for more crystal 
circles (two had been found al- 
ready). If the unit came under the 
influence of the light columns there 
were no companions to rescue him. 

Suddenly the fruit bat saw a 
momentary flash of red light on the 
brown rocks below. A large crimson 
crystal was there, a semi-transparent 
monolith fully five feet high, mov- 
ing steadily away from the lake. It 


bad left a trail behind it, a barely 
pero^tible line in the thin dust. The 
Racemind had an irrational liking 
for light seen through colored glass 
or similar substances, and it caus^ 
the fruit bat to glide within inches 
of the travelling monolith, merely to 
look through the crystal and see the 
sun transformed into a sphere of 
crimson fire. When the Racemind 
was satisfied, the fruit bat resumed 
his northward journey. Now that 
he knew what to look for, he saw 
many other trails in the dust. He 
also saw three more crystals, two 
blue and one yellow, aU heading 
south. 

Reaching the volcano, the fruit 
bat circled slowly above the crater 
to give the Racemind a complete 
picture. Warm steamy air was shim- 
mering upward from the circular 
lake, and little puffs of misty vapor 
hung over the still surface of the 
sapphire-colored waters. Seeing the 
almost luminous intensity of that 
blue liquid, the Racemind judged 
that the water had been stained by 
minerals — probably by ores of 
some transition elements. The fruit 
bats glimpsed vague shadows below 
the mists, but they were too in- 
distinct to be identified. Between the 
sapphire lake and the jagged edges 
of the vertical walls were two dif- 
ferent types of ground. The higher 
zone, just below the crater rim, was 
a wide sloping band of soil in which 
several thousand tumbleweed were 
rooted. Their feathery green leaves 
were tall and straight, indicating that 
they were too immature to be mo- 
bile yet. The second and lower zone, 
between the young tumbleweed and •

IF 



the lake, was the shore. When it 
realized what it was seeing, the 
Racemind sent the fruit bat down 
te perch on a shoreline boiddeir. It 
required a closer view of this unique 
beach. 

T he boulder must have fallen 
from the ramparts above, for 
there were no stones — or sand — 
on this beach. The entire shore was 
covered with fragments of colored 
glasslike material. The most com- 
mon colors were sapphire, crimson, 
emerald and yellow. The fragments 
ranged in size from several inches 
down to microscopic splinter and 
dust specks. They were o'bviously the 
remains of crystals which had brok- 
en up beside the water. Many of 
these colored shards were moving, 
shifting painfully toward the sap- 
phire water with feeble movements, 
©ne emerald flake pulled itself sev- 
eral inches before encountering a 
jagged crimson pebble too large to 
be slid over. The fruit bat watched 
a flat mauve fragment, a rough tri- 
angle in shape, rocking from side 
to side before sending itself slipping 
over its companions, most of which 
were also struggling to reach the 
lake. The mauve shard hit a more 
solid yellow fragment and split it in 
two. Both pieces of mauve crystal 
oontinued moving and managed to 
slide into the sapphire liquid; they 
immediately darted away like fish 
and vanished in the depths below 
the wisps of vapor. 

Twenty yards along the shore, a 
giant scarlet crystal was emerging 
from the lake. Taller than a human 
being, it dragged itself clear of the 


shallow blue liquid and stood up- 
right on the shore. It was vibrating 
rapidly, and the fruit bat glided to- 
wards it to investigate. Without 
warning, the scarlet crystal leaned to 
one side, overbalanced and toppled 
onto the 'beach. It shattered into a 
thousand pieces; some of the debris 
fell back into the sapphire waters. 
Most of the 'bright red fragments 
began crawling back to the lake, 
sliding themselves over the older 
and weaker shards. A few of them 
were focusing sunlight on other 
pieces, and a canary-yellow crystal 
suddenly split open, releasing a cloud 
of fine dust which drifted over the 
lake. Still subject icy the burning 
rays from the scarlet fragment, the 
remains of the yellow crystal be- 
gan to melt. 

All along the beach, colors were 
flashing out from the moving crystal 
flakes slowly returning to the sap- 
phire liquid. In the distance the shore 
appeared to 'be a rich brown, but 
nearer the unit all the separate colors 
were distinguishable as the shards 
sparkled in the sunlight. It was a 
sight as fascinating as the forests of 
colored glass mobiles which hung in 
the transparent domes of the ant 
cities. The countless tiny motions 
of the fragments gave the impres- 
sion that the whole shore was rip- 
pling like a tree in a 'breeze. In the 
shallow parts of the lake, near the 
beach where the blue water was low 
enough to 'be transparent, the Race- 
mind saw dozens of giant crystals 
wandering slowly across the lake 
floor. 

Another crystal came up through 
the shaUows, a misshapen crimson 


SUNBEAM CARESS 


27 



monolith with an opaque dark red 
growth on one side. It was moving 
through the last few inches of sap- 
phire water when it began vibrating 
rapidly as the scarlet crystal had. 
It hesitated with its base in the water, 
then slowly retreated towaird the 
deeper regions of the lake. Two 
feet of its height was still above 
the surface when it lurched to one 
side and disappeared in an explo- 
sion of spray. Concentric ripples 
spread out swiftly from the scene, 
intemipted by smaller ripples as 
crimson fragments splashed into the 
water. 

The Racemind watched two more 
giant crystals, both sapphire-colored, 
emerge from the lake and smash 
themselves to jagged pieces on the 
beach. A fifth crystal, four feet high 
and bright emerald in color, did not 
destroy itself. Moving purposefully 
out of the water, it dragged itself 
over the beach, crushing many of 
the shattered fragments as it went. A 
trail of dampness glistened behind 
it, and a few small shards dissolved 
in the pools before the 'liquid drain- 
ed away. The emerald green crystal 
reached the tumbleweed plantations 
on the slopes, and continiued through 
the open fields towards the crater 
ramparts which enclosed the lake. As 
the crystal travelled upwards, some 
tumbleweed plants curled their 
leaves into rough spheres. Uproot- 
ing themselves, the tumbleweed be- 
gan rolling up the slopes alter the 
emerald crystal. The monolith was 
heading for a narrow gap in the 
ridge, where it could pass through 
the high crater walls. The fruit bat 
left its boulder by the shore and 


ascended rapidly, shadowing the 
wanderer. Now accompanied by the 
tumbleweed, the emerald crystal pro- 
ceeded through the small canyon and 
out onto the dusty brown plateau. It 
started off across the stone wilder- 
ness, traveUin'g in a northwesterly 
direction. The Racemind sent the 
fruit bat gliding after the crystal. 

DC 

CITY OF DEATH 

T he pool in the cave and the 
lake in the crater both had 
the same function. Crystals, living 
crystals, were created in 'both. The 
process of evaporation in the cave 
was relatively ^mple, while crystal 
formation in the lake was a more 
advanced process, but the basic sim- 
ilarity was undeniable. Probably the 
crystals had other communal birth- 
places somewhere on the plateau. 
The cave system would have to be 
explored thoroughly. 

However fascinating the crystals 
might be, they were insignificant 
compared to the major problem — 
the light columns. The cave where 
Rrengyara had died was still sealed 
off by the force barrier created by 
the tall white column, and in the 
outlying districts of Land South- 
West more light columns were ap- 
pearing, adding to the difficulties 
caused by the outbreaks of war flow- 
ers. The manifestations always took 
the same pattern. Light columns of 
various colors arrived at the hill- 
side farms, accompanied by shoals 
of whirling tumbleweed, and the 
familiar sequence of mental disor- 


28 


IF 



ganization began in the farm units. 
Automatic group-solidarity rhythms 
sustained the units under attack un- 
til reinforcements arrived. Apparent- 
ly realizing that superior mental 
forces opposed them, the light col- 
umns then retreated hack into the 
mountains. Rescue units pursuing the 
light columns followed them into the 
high volcanic regions, where the 
columns glided into oaves and dis- 
appeared behind invisible barriers. 
All these attacks had taken place 
either this morning or the previous 
evening, and the latest was not yet 
over. 

The situation was static at pres- 
ent, with guard units waiting for 
the cave entrances to become clear 
again. Up on the plateau several 
crystals were seen, but the light 
columns remained absent until a 
fruit bat sighted a group of lime 
green columns near a crystal circle. 
The scout flew down to investigate 
further, and as he did this the Race- 
mind began receiving information 
about the ancient city of seamen. The 
seafarmer units had arrived at the 
city. 

Centuries ago, the Racemind had 
completed its researches here and 
prevented unauthorized exploration 
of this submarine city by simply in- 
suring that the units did not think 
of entering it. No unit visited the 
city after that until the seafarmers 
swam up to the battlements of the. 
outer perimeter. These old walls, 
now partially covered with ooze, 
encircled the entire city. The Race- 
mind had never discovered the pur- 
pose of the bizarre fortifications. 
Beyond them, past the strip of clear 


ground, light were burning where 
no 'lights had been 'before. Other 
machhies 'besides the revolution- 
counters had been waiting for the 
zero moment. 

T he density of animal and plant 
life in the city was extremely 
high, and the waters were warmer 
than usual. The seafarmers smelt 
offal and decaying human flesh in 
the water ahead. As they approached 
the first of boxlike buildings, they 
saw predatory fish swimming along 
the radial interconnecting streets, 
wandering in mixed packs as though 
the creatures were not hereditary 
enemies. Little scraps of food mat- 
ter were floating in the water, be- 
ing eaten by scavengers of all sizes 
from jellyfish to webworms. The 
trained eyes of the plankton farmers 
reported the presence of innumerable 
unicellular objects feeding on mat- 
ter too small to toe seen. Crabs, 
bloodsponges, small squids and 
other creatures were moving about 
on the lower levels. None of the 
predators seemed interested in the 
seafarmers. 

The city bad ibeen constructed on 
a hemispherical plan, with the tallest 
buildings in the mid^e and the low- 
est buildings on the outermost con- 
centric circular streets. The struc- 
tures on the outer rings were the best 
preserved, because many of the high 
central blocks bad collapsed with 
age and destroyed numerous other 
buildings when they fell. The sea- 
farmer units gained height and glid- 
ed over the outer streets, surveying 
the remains below them. In the cen- 
ter of the city, where the buildings 


SUNBEAM CARESS 


29 



were nothing more than heaps of 
age-darkened rubble under the coat- 
ing of ooze, the great saucer-ahaped 
depression within die tallest remain- 
ing buildings was filled with the 
bodies of dead humans. It was a 
submarine iboneyard, and many of 
the bones still bore rotting flesh 
which trailed in long strips from the 
skeletons. The odor of decay hang- 
ing over the scene was overpower- 
ing. Fish were tearing away at the 
foul meat as the seafaimers watched. 
Many of the intact buildings con- 
tained more of the bodies, and by 
sending some units to peer through 
transpar^t window-panels into seal- 
ed lighted rooms the Racemind con- 
firmed that it knew the identity of 
these dead humans. They were the 
seamen, and they had been extinct 
for thousands of years. 

During its researches three thou- 
sand years ago, the Racemind had 
discovered numerous scientific in- 
struments in these buUding^, Some 
were removed, such as the revolu- 
tion-counters, but most were replac- 
ed when the Racemind finished stud- 
ying them. The units were sent to 
open up an old laboiratQry where 
they found somie sdi^tific equip- 
ment in good condition. Many of 
the strange mechano-electric devices 
had resumed functioning of their 
own accord, as the city public light- 
ing and temperature control systems 
had done. 

By direct experiment many, many 
years ago the Racemind had learned 
the numerical symbols and systems 
of calibration us^ by the seamen, so 
it could understand the readings on 
the instruments. It swiftly discover- 


ed that the bodies of the seamen were 
slightly radioactive, checking a num- 
ber of corpses to make sure. The 
radioactivity was on too low a level 
to affect ^e creatures feeding on 
the bodies, but it was definitely well 
above normal. The seafaimers dis- 
sected some corpses and found that 
all parts were equally radioactive. 
The Racemind accepted this latest 
news and made plans for a full- 
scale expedition to visit the city im- 
mediately. 

The bodies had been in the water 
for approximately three weeks, and 
the revolution-counters had reached 
zero three weeks ago. Archeological 
evidence showed that the seamen had 
attempted to project themselves into 
the future, and the boneyard had 
materialized during a period of the 
most frequent and prolonged time- 
mirages ever recorded. This explain- 
ed Why the seamen became extinct 
so suddenly. 

However, the actual relevance 
of this information to the current 
problem of the light columns was 
doubtful. (In particular, the ap- 
pearance of that crystalnforming lake 
in the volcanic crater had most dis- 
turbing implications.) It was high- 
ly improbable that the seamen were 
concerned with events on the plateau 
in any way. The Racemind would 
have thought it impossible, consid- 
ering the evidence, but for the fact 
that die advent of the light columns 
nearly coincided with the delayed 
extinction of the seamen. If there 
was no direct connection between 
the events, both might be linked to 
a third factor which was as yet un- 
recognized.

THE QUEST CONTINUES 

T he Racemind now knew the des- 
tination of the emerald crystals 
and its attendant shoal of tumble- 
weed. It was travelling in a perfect- 
ly straight line towards the crystal 
circle which had just been discovered 
l»y a fruit bat. At its present speed, 
which had not changed since the 
crystal emerged from the blue lake, 
it would reach the circle in approxi- 
mately one hour. Modifying its plans 
to accommodate this new scheme of 
events, the Racemind made the scout 
near the circle land and watch from 
behind a purple outcrop just outside 
the effective range of the telepathic 
impulses from the light column. The 
other fruit bat in the vicinity con- 
tinued following the emerald crystal. 

The faint mental aberrations 
caused by the lime green columns 
did not prevent the Racemind main- 
taining full control over the fruit 
feat as he lay stretched out on the 
ledge. Eleven crystals, each about 
four feet hi'gh, were slowly draggmg 
themselves around the rim of a cir- 
cular area twenty feet across. The 
interior of the disk was smooth, 
unmarked ground; the crystals had 
done nothing to it so far. The eleven 
were spaced out eveAly as they mov- 
ed along their circular path, and 
at regular intervals the fruit bat saw 
the sun’s reflection flashing out 
from the colored surface. The eleven 
crystals were identical in size and 
shape but not in color; five were 
blue, four were crimson and two 
were emerald green. Unlike the col- 


orless crystals in the first circle, 
these were clear and unscarred. Their 
sides were smooth and straight, and 
obviously they were all relatively 
young. The air around them seemed 
clear and bright, for their outlines 
were sharp against the brown back- 
ground blurring in the rising heat- 
haze. ^ 

The fruit bat watched from the 
ledge for over an hour without see- 
ing any change in the rhythmic 
movements of the crystals. The lime 
green columns remain motionless, 
standing to one side of the circle. 

At last the lone emerald crystal 
appeared, with the green tumbleweed, 
rolling around it. As it approached 
the circle, the crystals already there 
began to move closer together along 
the perimeter, forming a widening 
gap for the newcomer. The crystal 
joined the others, and now there 
were twelve colored monoliths slow- 
ly circling the site of the new danc- 
ing ground. The tumbleweed left 
their crystal and rolled to a halt 
beside the stationary lime green col- 
umns. 

The second fruit bat, following 
some distance behind the emerald 
crystal, was about to glide down to 
join the first scout on the outcrop 
when he saw a momentary flash of 
green light a short distance south- 
east of the circle. Maintaining 
height, he saw that another emerald 
crystal was coming towards the cir- 
cle, accompanied by a number of 
other creatures including at least 
two varieties of light column: car- 
mine and lemon yellow. The Race- 
mind then brought the scout down 
to the outcrop and sent up the 


SUNBEAM CARESS 


31 



other fruit bat, the one who^ had 
been resting on the ledge, to ex- 
amine the group of new arrivals. 

Besides the emerald crystal, the 
carmine and yellow light columns 
and the inevitable tumbleweed, the 
strange little company included sev- 
eral dozen sucker-studded wander- 
cacti. These unusual plants were 
over three feet high, only a few 
inches wide, and progressed over 
the rocks by hydralike somersault- 
ing, using their terminal suckers to 
grip the stones. Three tall light 
columns of a pale turquoise color 
were accompanied by some white 
balls of flitterdown, the first time 
the Racemind had noticed flitter- 
down with the columns. A flock of 
tiny milk-white cave crystals were 
flying in diamond-formation above 
the wandercacti. This completed the 
group, except for a dark human 
female with peculiar skin, coloration, 
walking 'beside the emerald crystal. 

Studying the human, the Race- 
mind realized that she was Rreng- 
yara, the unit who had been killed 
in a cave. 

A swift mental probe at maximum 
sensitivity revealed no trace of 
her thoughts. That, and her curious 
sihuffling tread, showed that she was 
dead. The Racemind could not re- 
gard this as certain, because it had 
not recorded her death impulses, but 
there was little possibility of error. 
Something must be controlling her 
body, yet the zombiesnakes had been 
exterminated thousands of years ago, 
and nothing like them had arisen 
since. The obvious conclusion was 
that the light colunms were respon- 


sible. They were the only indepen- 
dent creatures with the potential in- 
telligence and ability to perform tiie 
feat of controlling a dead body. The 
cats could sometimes control a live 
body, but their powers extended no 
further. 

Rrengyara was walking like a 
somnambulist. Her arms hung limp- 
ly, and her head was bent down. As 
the group passed near the fruit bat 
watching from near the circle, the 
Racemind obtained a close detailed 
picture of what should have been 
Rrengyara’s skin. Her naked body, 
once smooth and brown, was cover- 
ed with a black resiny substance in 
which white particles were gleam- 
ing. The crystals attacking her in 
the cave had embedded themselves 
in her flesh, causing thousands of 
tiny wounds, and they were still 
there. Her skin could not be seen, 
for the blood from her many wounds 
had flowed out over her and con- 
gealed into a black mass partially 
covering the crystals. Her nostrils 
were free, but her eyes and ears 
were completely blocked. The coat- 
ing of blood and crystals bad fused 
her hands and feet into forms re- 
sembling flippers; the digits were 
barely visible. 

The emerald crystal, and the crea- 
tures around it, reached the dancing 
ground. The light columns glided 
silently over to the lime-green col- 
umns standing to one side, and the 
tumbleweed by the green columns 
rolled tht other way to join the new- 
comers. Rrengyara collapsed on the 
ground, and the flying cave crystals 
piled themselves into a white pyra- 
mid beside her body. The other crea- 


32 


IF 



tures all c^e to a halt. Only the 
emerald crystal still moved. The 
crystals of the circle slowed down 
aiid stopped on the perimeter, all 
at regular initervals except for a 
double-sized gap which the new 
arrival entered. All motion ceased; 
even the tumbleweed and flitter- 
down were still. The thirteen crys- 
tals stood tall and shining on the 
circular line they had scratched on 
the stone. 

Very slowly, the great crystals be- 
gan to move. One after the other, 
they dragged themseives in a curv- 
ing line towards the center of the 
circle. As they travelled along their 
separate paths, a pattern gradually 
took shape on the ground where the 
rock had been marked by their pass- 
age. The design was familiar: a 
thirteen-armed star, it was the basis 
for all the crystal circles the Race- 
mind had found. 

Presently the crystals ceased their 
ritual and returned to their posi- 
tions on the perimeter. The assem- 
bled creatures broke into movement 
again. The tumbleweed rolled and 
whirled around the circle, the host 
of tiny crystals flew into the air, the 
wandercacti somersaulted in unison, 
Rrengyara stirred and rose to her 
feet, the flitterdown fluffballs emit- 
ted their supersonic squeaks, and all 
the light columns except the lime- 
green ones began to slide over the 
rock away from the circle. The pale 
turquoise columns led the way to- 
wards the mass of purple outcrops 
on the western side of the plateau, 
and only some tumbleweed and the 
lime green columns did not follow. 
The creatures streamed away from 


the thirteen crystals — the enigmS- 
tic light columns and a dead human» 
a horde of leaping cacti and bounc- 
ing tumbleweed, and flitterdown and 
cave crystals swirling in chaotic pat- 
terns against the sky. 

One fruit ibat followed the de- 
parting multitude at a safe distance, 
leaving the other to continue the 
surveillance over the circle. The 
creatures bad just disappeared be- 
hind a tall fanglike outcrop when 
the large crystals started to move 
again. They tilted themselves at dif- 
ferent angles, land beams of colored 
light flashed into being: crimson, 
sapphire and emerald. The thirteen 
crykals were focusing the sunlight 
on one of the paths they had traced 
out to the center. As the rock be- 
gan to soften, below a newly formed 
heat-haze, the tumbleweed arranged 
themselves into a circle surrounding 
the thirteen crystals. They rolled 
around the dancing ground, gaining 
speed as they circled the crystals, 
while the lime-green light columns 
watched impassively. Only the faint 
mental whispering indicated that the 
columns had any part in the cere- 
mony. 

The turquoise light columns led 
their army into a large cave mouth 
some distance away. The fruit bat 
remained outside. 

When it ibecame clear that the 
creatures would not reappear, the 
Racemind sent the fruit bat into 
the cave. Other members of the 
expedition were flying to the area, 
but at present the fruit bat was 
alone. He could not be regarded as 
expendable unitil the reinforcements 
arrived, so the Racemind was pre- 


SUNBEAM CARESS 


33 



pared to remove him from the cave 
at the first hint of danger. 

I n the dark tunnel, the Racemind 
relied on -the fruit hat’s echo- 
location squeaks for a description 
of his surroundings. The picture so 
obtained was accurate enough, but 
it lacked a number of details which 
could only be gathered visually. The 
fruit bat glided silently into a small 
diamber from which three tunnels 
led furdier down into the rock. A 
faint milky light could just be seen 
in the middle opening, and the fruit 
bat headed toward the glow. The 
Racemind observed that the sides 
of die cave were straight and smooth. 
This part of the cave was obviously 
artificial. As the soft white glow 
grew stronger, alien emotions in- 
filtrated the fruit hat’s mental pro- 
cesses, arousing warm thoughts of 
peace, brotherhood and individual- 
ism, conflicting with their counter- 
parts in the Racemind’s conditioning. 
It was the first step in breaking the 
Racemind’s control over the fruit 
bat, and it meant that at least one 
light column was in the cave ahead. 

The Racemind let the unit con- 
tinue toward the glow, ready to 
make him flee should the telepathic 
disturbance (become too strong. How- 
ever, the level of interference was 
stiU tolerable when the fruit bat 
came to the end of the tunnel. The 
scout hung from the ceiling, con- 
cealed among the shadows, and gaz- 
ed at the strange little subterranean 
world before him. Tall crystals of 
various colors were everywhere, 
sending beams of colored light across 
the cave. A large pool of luminous 


liquid down; at the far end cast its 
white radiance ovot a series of stone 
terraces and strips of gre^ vegeta- 
tion. The ceiling, ten feet above the 
highest terrace, bore dusters of nun- 
ute milky ^ crystals which gave 
off greenish-white phosphoreGoence. 
Light columns of many coiors stood 
on the paved stone avenue betweei 
the strips of soil, and at intervals 
along the plantations were diameleon 
cacti ceasdessly imitating the colors 
of the columns. Other plants grow- 
ing under the stone roof were tum- 
bleweed, wandercacti, cracklehushes 
and several varieties of ferns. On the 
terraces, cmwling 'between the light 
columns, were little brown animals 
which the Racemind had not seen be- 
fore. The animals had no heads or 
tails, and their only limhs were four 
furry projections like starfish arms. 
Their bodies were f^tureless and 
extraordinarily mobile. 

The effort of resisting the con- 
stant mental barrage was weakening 
the fruit bat. The scout was losing 
his powers of concentration, and his 
eyes were not scanning the cavern 
properly. The Racemind made him 
depart from the cavern, flying along 
the tunnel by which he had entered 
it. Next he could explore one of 
the other passages. There had been 
no trace of Rrengyaia or any flit- 
terdown in the cavern, so it was 
probable that the party from the 
crystal circle had taken (another turn- 
ing. The fruit bat glided into the 
small chamber where the cave di- 
vided into three. 

At that moment the Racemind 
received information from two 
speedy flying ants travelling ahead

of the main expedition. Far to the 
north, they saw a group of light 
columns and tumbleweed heading 
rapidly towards the cave entrances. 
They would be here within minutes. 
Immediately the Racemind sent the 
fruit bat out of the cave back into 
the hot sunlight, where the unit took 
cover on top of a tall rock spire. 
From this vantage point the fruit 
bat watched three lemon-yellow 
columns and a shoal of tumbleweed 
approach and vanish into the cave 
mouth. The Racemind took no fur- 
ther action. It waited for the units 
of the expedition to arrive before 
it resumed the exploration of this 
cave. 

XI 

VISIONS IN THE HEAT-HAZE 

T he Racemind was now certain 
that there was no direct con- 
nection between the light columns 
and the extinct seamen. However, it 
had found a hypothetical third fac- 
tor: the timenmirages. After that in- 
tense series of time-mirages three 
weeks ago, minute seismic disturb- 
ances had been recorded coming 
from the plateau area. The dis- 
turbances were continuing and frac- 
tionally increasing in strength. Sim- 
ilar phenomena were detected when- 
ever new tunnels were being con- 
structed, and the obvious implica- 
tion was that the light columns were 
expanding the natural cave system. 

Coincidence was a pattern of 
events which the Racemind always 
refused to accept until all other 
possibilities were exhausted; there 


must be some reason why the light 
columns had started tunneling only 
a day after that zero moment three 
wed^ ago. Perhaps the columns had 
succeeded where the seamen had 
failed, projecting themselves through 
the time-mirages from another age. 
That would explain the lack of 
any relationship 'between the columns 
and the normal protoplasmic forms 
of life. It would also mean assum- 
ing that the columns possessed pow- 
ers far greater than those of any 
known creature or group of crea- 
tures. It meant that in a mere three 
weeks they had brought about all 
the changes on the plateau noted by 
the Racemind — including the con- 
version of the old crater into an 
evaporation-basin for the crystals. 
And the crystals themselves were 
a problem, (being living creatures 
without any detectable mental pro- 
cesses. Had they been created on 
the plateau, or had they come 
through the time-mirages with the 
columns? Certaiinly they had not 
come into being through the nor- 
mal processes of evolution. 

A point of questionable import- 
ance, at this stage, was the series 
of attacks on the outlying farms. 
They were indecisive affairs, and 
the Racemind was not sure that 
they were intended to be attacks. The 
columns could mount a more vig- 
orous campaign if they chose; as 
it was, the war flowers were do- 
ing more damage than the columns. 
Of course, this raised the question 
of what the light columns were 
trying to do at the farms. It might 
be worth sacriflcing a small farm 
to see what happened.

The small brown animals on the 
subterranean terraces presented an- 
other problem. The Raoemind had 
now finished going through its ac- 
cumulated memories, and no such 
animals bad been seen anywhere in 
the ant-controlled world. Also, they 
had no obvious ancestors. Like the 
cr3rstals and light columns, they 
might have arisen spontaneously. 
There was a difference, of course, 
because the brown creatures were 
composed of protoplasm. As a work- 
ing hypothesis, the Racemind as- 
sumed that the light columns had 
created the crystals — a relatively 
simple feat — but did their pow- 
ers extend to the creation of living 
cells? There were too many unknown 
factors for an answer to 'be appar- 
ent. However, similar situations had 
occurred before and would occur 
again. The Racemind had encoun- 
tered many strange animals just after 
the Ice Age, during its ill-fated 
northward expansion, and the in- 
termediate stages in their evolution 
had remained obscure for centuries. 
Similarly, several parallels were re- 
corded in the memories the Race- 
mind had reviewed. As one example. 
Land South-East had recently suf- 
fered a plague of small tentacled in- 
sects which had swarmed in from 
the coast. The ancestors of these 
creatures would be discovered, given 
time. All things considered, the 
Racemind concluded that no final 
decision could be reached about the 
brown animals until further data 
were obtained. Soon the expedition 
would join the fruit ibat waiting out- 
side the cave, and then some units 
would explore the tunnel system 


again. Guards were positioned by 
Other caves where light columns had 
disappeared, but this was the only 
such entrance not sealed by an in- 
visible barrier. 

T he appearance of the tentacled 
insects was another of the ran- 
dom evolutionary changes recorded 
in the memories the Racemind bad 
been studying. Other changes were 
equally interesting. For instance, the 
sitreamerhags had altered in color, 
and their bodies no longer resembled 
a cluster of transparent white worms. 
The parasites were now flame-col- 
ored, and a bunch of streamerhags on 
a tree branch could easily be mis- 
taken for a small fire when the 
long orange-red tails were being 
blown about by <the breeze. Color 
changes were taking place in other 
creatures as well. 

The dragonflies had become num- 
erous under the ant civilization, and 
their brightly colored adult bodies 
were the subjects of many mobiles in 
the relaxation domes. Their larvae, 
the -monstrous nymphs, were toler- 
ated because the Racemind coveted 
their adult forms. After the new 
change the hideous larvae might 
become as popular as the adults, for 
their tough hides were bearing glossy 
metallic sheens which sparkled in 
the sunlight. A few weak-minded 
units had become hypnotized by the 
sight of these jewel-skinned monsters 
churning through the mud of the 
moat bottoms. 

The cat warrens, deep in the 
uncultivated jungle, had changed lit- 
tle. The defenses were slightly more 
elaborate, and the rats were even 


36 


IF 



fewer in number, but that was all. 
The cats were still content to re- 
main within their own territory, and 
they respected the ant units as long 
as there was no suspicion that the 
ants were hunting the oats’ food 
animals. Because the ants took only 
plants from the jomgie, no clashes 
had occurred since the last unsuc- 
cessful attempt to incorporate the 
cats into the Racemind. The ants 
now regarded the cats as a normally 
irrelevant natural hazard which was 
harmless unless provoked. The in- 
credible mental and physical resist- 
ance which countered the ants’ last 
attack would have ruined civilization 
if the Racemind had not withdrawn 
in time. The cats were the only race 
of intelligent independent individ- 
uals the ants had known — the 
seamen had become extinct before 
the Racemind learned of their exist- 
ence. The rats which 'lived in asso- 
ciation with the cats were not in- 
tlligent and were dying out. The 
cat population had not increased. 

One constant feature of the re- 
ports was the appearance on the 
shores of mutated fish trying to 
conquer land, unaware that their 
efforts were too late. With the new 
increase in solar radiation more 
fish than ever were re-enacting this 
phase of evolutionary history, and 
in several places they were having 
an unexpected effect on the ecology 
of the coastal plains in Land South- 
East. 

Q uite early in thei current radia- 
tion cycle, the wiry marram 
grass had undergone a spectacular 
change. Expanding rapidly over for- 


merly bare sand dunes, die marram 
grass wove itself into a ithick blanket 
which provided shelter for the small 
desert mice, sand martins, scorpions 
and other ftnimak of the arid coast. 
The grass received scraps of decaying 
food matter, regular supplies of ex- 
cretion land the dead bodies of the 
animals. The symbiotic partnership 
worked well for some time. Then 
the little fish with their crude lungs 
and stumpy legs began living in the 
grass, desperately eager to colonize 
the land. At first they occupied the 
grass nests by ni^t, hunting food 
in the ocean ^by day, but when they 
returned from the sea they dripped 
salt water over the grass, gradually 
killing off the plants. When the 
grass near the shore died away, the 
fish moved further inland, the pro- 
cess continuing imtil the fish w^e 
imable to reach the sea in a single 
day. Some learned to live on land 
food, and the others died. The force 
of natural selection, acting on un- 
stable genes, accelerated the pace 
of evolution still further. After a 
hundred years of this, strange am- 
phibious creatures moved in great 
migratory herds from the plains to 
the coastal water and back, taking 
about a month for the whole jour- 
ney. The entire ecology of the 
plains and the grass-covered dunes 
was now centered on these monthly 
migrations. 

Another changing ecology was 
that of the atmosphere. The aerial 
plankton were one-ceHed microsco- 
pic plants and animals which spent 
their short lives drifting through the 
air like dust, never touching the 
ground. They were the sole diet of 


SUNBEAM CARESS 


37 



many small insects and had existed 
in their present forms since well 
before the earliest days of the ant 
civilization. Now, for the first time 
in thousands of years, the myriad 
species of aerial plankton were un- 
dergoing mass mutations. Many were 
becoming flatter, and their bodies 
were covered with beautiful symme- 
trical patterns like snowflakes. Their 
numbers were increasing rapidly, be- 
cause some of the insect predators 
could not adapt to feeding on the 
new species. To check this sudden 
population growth, the ants would 
have to breed new insects for the 
work of keeping down the aerial 
plankton. 

In one of the desert regions, the 
wandercacti had started the plant 
counterpart of the animal bone- 
yards. From all over the defsert, the 
wandercacti arrived singly or in pairs, 
somersaulting over the sand in lithe 
imitation of a hydra. They planted 
themselves for the last time in a 
steep-sided waterless valley and re- 
mained there until they died of de- 
hydration. The valley floor was cov- 
ered with brittle green corpses. Other 
plants came to die as well, especial- 
ly the round mobile tumblewe^ and 
the graceful glitterbells. The Race- 
mind knew, as the plants must know 
too, that the rocks of the valley in- 
cluded thick coal measures. One day 
the piled dead plants would catch 
fire, perhaps from the sun shining 
through a transparent glitterbell 
petal, and then the coal would be 
ignited. Once started, the death mi- 
grations would never cease. The 
aged plants would keep coming to 
their dying ground even though the 


valley was a mass of flame. Some 
artist units, redecorating the cities, 
saw the possibilities and began de- 
signing murals to show the plants 
travelling over the yellow sands and 
immolating themselves in the valley 
of fire. 

XII 

BESIDE THE CIRCLE 

T he expedition joined the fruit bat 
on the stretch of open ground 
outside the cave. The purple outcrop 
towered high above them,^its out- 
line sharp and clear against the blue 
sky. Wasting no time, the Racemind 
sent a flying ant into the cave. See- 
ing by infrared light, the ant found 
nothing until it turned into the little 
chamber where the tunnel divided 
into three. The chamber was flooded 
with pale white radiance, and the 
ant came to a sudden halt. Before 
it were two tall figures: a slender 
white column and Rrengyara, her 
blackened body full of tiny points 
of light. Around them swirled a liv- 
ing cloud of cave crystals. No alien 
thoughts were audible, but this ab- 
normal feature did not slow the re- 
actions of the Racemind. It made 
the ant turn and retreat from the 
chamber at full speed. Abruptly, 
without any mental disturbance, con- 
tact was lost. It was a clean blank, 
identical to the death/capture of 
Rrengyara. The Racemind ordered 
three powerful humans into the cave, 
but they were stopped by another 
invisible barrier. The cave was closed. 

Back at the crystal circle, the fruit 
bat watching the colored monoliths 


38 


IF 



was in danger. The lime-green col- 
umns were moving towards ihim, and 
he was powerless to flee. His limbs 
would not obey the Racemind’s 
oommands. His mind was filled with 
mental interference, the seductive 
thoughts of (freedom, independence 
and brotherhood broadcast by the 
light columns. The contradictions in 
the various thoughts did not make 
them any less dangerous. The Race- 
mind us^ all available methods of 
control, without effect. The fruit 
bat responded to nothing but the 
light columns. His thoughts were 
fainter, becoming cloudy and inco- 
herent like those of a unit entering 
the dream caverns. 

The Raoemind sent the expedition 
speeding over the rocks to the 
trapped scout. If they were in time, 
their proximity would strengthen 
the mental group-solidarity patterns 
enough to save him. The attempt al- 
most succeeded. The racing units 
were within sight of the circle when 
the fruit bat's thoughts ceased al- 
together. Hovering well above the 
thirteen crystals, the units saw the 
fruit bat glide from his ledge and 
land on the brown rooks by the 
lime-green columns. Telepathic im- 
pulses whispered in the minds of the 
expedition units, but ithey could re- 
sist the attack by combining their 
mental resources. 

T he fruit bat was not dead, it ap- 
peared. He clawed his way into 
the air, rising from the mid^e of 
the group of green columns, and 
with some difficulty he rose towards 
the eighty-odd units circling above. 
As Rrengyara had done, the fruit bat 


was moving without thinking; the 
Racemind could detect no mental 
processes. The captured scout had 
no more thoughts than one of the 
crystals standing on the now dancing 
ground below. The Racemind made 
repeated unsuccessful telepathic 
probes as the fruit bat approached 
the hovering units. Finally the fruit 
bat reached the height of the ex- 
pedition and i^ided slowly to and fro 
before the assembled units, moving 
sluggishly as if in pain. The Race- 
mind waited for the scout to act. 

Suddenly a great burst of mental 
force lash^ out at the expedition — 
the thoughts of the light columns, 
amplified many times. The units* de- 
fences went into operation automatic- 
ally, and the attack stopped after 
less than a second. The fruit bat 
drifted back down to the iground, re- 
turning to the light columns by the 
circle. The incident was over, leav- 
ing the Raoemind wondering just 
what the columns had hoped to 
achieve. The Raoemind was begin- 
ning to favor the hypothesis that the 
“attadcs” were really attempts at 
communication. But it could not ex- 
plain the oapture/killing of Rrengya- 
ra and the other lost units. 

A tall isolated outcrop of purple 
rock was rituated to the south of 
the crystal cirde. The expedition set- 
tled onto its ledges and looked down 
on the circle and the columns, wait- 
ing for the next attack. The Race- 
mind was certain the li^t columns 
would contiinue their efforts to make 
mental contact, and it wanted its 
units fairly alert when the next 
move was miule. 

Nearly ah hour went by. The crea-

tures below were motionless all the 
time, even the tiumbleweed. The thir- 
teen colored crystals — emerald, 
crimson and sapphire blue' — were 
standing on the rim of their new 
dancing ground, waiting like the 
others. 

Two moving objects appeared 
from behind a spur of purple-red 
stone. The Racemind identified them 
at once; Rrengyara and the tall white 
light column. Thousands of tiny 
white cave crystals darted to and fro 
above them. Faint mental static came 
from the column. Reaching the lime- 
green columns, they halted. Then 
Rrengyara went on alone, around the 
crystal circle, towards the outcrop 
where the expedition was gathered. 
The units watched her approach, with 
strange emotions from the humans 
in the party. Her dark body still 
had those little white crystals em- 
bedded in it. 

Standing before the expedition, 
without looking up at the units cov- 
ering the rock above her, Rrengyara 
said: “We must speak with you, 
Racemind of Earth.“ 

Commimication had begun. 

XIII 

THE QUEST ENDS 

R rengyara was using the vocal 
speech still current among the 
humans. Telepathic contact was as 
remote as ever, so the Racemind was 
forced to reply through one of its 
human units. The human left its 
ledge and stood before Rrengyara. 
Slowly, using the time-consuming 
spoken language, the Racemind 


learned the facts about the light 
columns and their associated life 
forms. 

The Racemind had a good knowl- 
edge of astronomy, and in addition 
to this its scientist units had continu- 
ously studied the sun to predict the 
effects of the variations in solar ra- 
diation. However, it had never con- 
sidered using its knowledge of the 
solar system for other purposes. As 
Rrengyara spoke, items of hitherto 
unconnected information in the 
Racemind’s memories began fitting 
together. 

The ancient humans had travelled 
to otl;ier worlds, Rrengyara said. At 
the height of their powers, these 
humans reached the sun and at- 
tacked it with their machines. Bad- 
ly wounded, the sun drove them off. 
It was still in the proce^ of heal- 
ing itself, and its radiaitior^ would 
not return to normal until it was 
well again. The radiation causing 
the evolutionary changes on Earth 
was characteristic of a sun-creature’s 
growth stage and had caused the 
great leaps of evolution in the past 
until it became weaker in the sun’s 
adolescence. This radiation was now 
stronger than it had been in any 
previous period of the sun’s life, and 
this was the missing factor linking 
the ligjit columns with the seamen. 
The seamen had travelled from the 
past, via the timenmirages, and the 
light columns had travelled from 
the sun, along the waves of solar 
radiation. 

The sun was a living creature — 
what else but life could waste en- 
ergy at such an appalling rate? — 
and it had parasites in its circulatory 


SUNBEAM CARESS

system. The light columns lived in 
the Bright Ways, streams of living 
matter carrying complex energy sys- 
tems to all parts of the atomic fur- 
nace which was the sun. The light 
columns, for all their vast exper- 
ience and powers, were merely para- 
sites which the sun did not even no- 
tice. After the arrival and retreat of 
the humans, several groups of li^t 
columns decided that life on Earth 
would be far more rewarding than 
life in the Bright Ways. Extrapolat- 
ing the sun’s recovery sequence and 
selecting the most powerful burst 
of radiation, these ligjit columns left 
their fellow parasites and started the 
long hazardous journey to Earth. 
Ninety per cent of them died on 
the way. 

On Earth, the light columns soon 
learned that the planet was a dead 
world, and that life belonged to a 
few weird objects of jellylBce sub- 
stance. The machines which had in- 
trigued the solar parasites had dis- 
appeared centuries ago. Undismayed, 
the light columns started a new civili- 
zation centered on their own com- 
munal mind. The crater lake where 
the giant crystals were formed was 
created in five days, and the first 
cave crystals were made even soon- 
er. The work of expanding the cave 
system had begun immediately. Tum- 
bleweed came rolling to the plateau, 
from the fertile western valleys, ac- 
companied by the little brown ani- 
mals the Racemind had seen on the 
underground terraces. The crystals 
were taught sun worship as a first 
step towards developing their po- 
tential intelligence. The work went 
on without a break until some light 


columns exploring the dry eastern 
valleys encountered a party of human 
children. 

From that brief contact, the light 
columns knew that another and prob- 
ably hostile group consdousness ex- 
isted on this planet. While the col- 
umns were making plans for in- 
vestigating this other intelligence, the 
human scout Rrengyara was found 
by some cave crystals. She was cap- 
tured and incorporated into the 
group mind by force. Studying the 
mist^es made on Rrengyara, the 
columns learned how to take over 
controlled creatures without causing 
physical damage. However, when 
their emissaries visited some farms 
they were repulsed by seemingly im- 
pregnable mental defenses. More ant- 
controlled scouts were captured, but 
the problem of communication was 
not solved untifthe columns brought 
Rrengyara to make vocal contact 
with the Racemind. 

A s Rrengyara spoke, the Racemind 
learned that its own condition- 
ing was (responsible for the mental 
silence from the crystals, captured 
units and other life forms with 
the ^columns. The knowledge of its 
own impotence had caused an ac- 
cidental mental block. Conflicting 
mental impulses had resulted in a 
disruption of the command chan- 
nels, spreading to affect receptivity 
as well. Considering this point, the 
Racemind worked out a method of 
deconditioning a unit so that direct 
mental contact could be made with 
the light columns. That should re- 
move the Racomind’s self-induced 
mental blocks. The next step was 


42 


IF 



to take over the light columns, and 
it worked out a method for that too. 
The main unknown factor now was 
the strength of resistance from the 
columns. The Racemind partially de- 
cenditioned a flying ant and sent 
a thought probe through it into the 
nearest crystal. 

Rrengyara broke off her speech. 
Through her, the light columns said, 
“Stop that!” 

The crystal was an intelligent 
creature with a mental field similar 
to that of a human. The Racemind 
withdrew quickly and sent a probe 
into Rrengyara. Her mind was a 
void in which tiny pictorial thoughts 
hurtled through darkness, like me- 
teors in the night. The columns’ con- 
trol stabbed the black emptiness as 
a cylindrical bar of burning matter. 
In those flames the Racemind saw 
the basic drive which motivated the 
light columns — an instinctive de- 
sire to extend life over every particle 
of inanimate substance that existed. 
The columns had a vision of an 
Earth in which every piece of mat- 
ter was alive and knew its brother- 
hood with the rest of the living 
world. Even the rocks would have 
awareness and emotions of their own. 

“This must cease,” said Rrengyara. 
“We must control you.” 

‘That will be decided when I pos- 
sess the necessary data,” the Race- 
mind replied. Without hesitation it 
sent a probe into the nearest light 
column. 

The result was chaos. 

Now the Racemind learned how 
effective the light column’s thoughts 
could be when used as a weapon. The 
wave of mental force almost en- 


gulfed the units in that first in- 
stant before the automatic defenses 
went up. Immediately the entire 
expedition — including those sta- 
tioned elsewhere — went into a form 
of cataleptic trance which enabled 
the Racemind to continue the battle 
without being forced to direct vital 
energy into the maintenance of the 
units’ bodies. All perception of their 
surroundings ceased as their life en- 
er^es were thrown into the defense. 
Within seconds the attack faltered, 
and the Racemind knew the light 
columns were unable to make a sus- 
tained effort on this level. It could 
master them. And as it realized this 
the failing attack died away alto- 
gether. 

The light columns would be weak- 
ened now. The Racemind made a 
fleeting mental contact with the col- 
umn it had probed. The parasite of 
the Bright Ways was capable of in- 
dependent thought, like a human. 
Counterparts of the human emo- 
tions existed in the column’s psy- 
chological structure. Over everything 
was the burning vision of the* Bright 
Ways, the piaradise which might yet 
be created here on Earth. The fierce 
desire to spread life to every atom 
of the world pounded out from the 
lime-green column, accompanied by 
the intense loni^g for all this un- 
created life to be part of a single 
gigantic world-organism. 

As the Racemind absorbed j:he 
colunm’s thoughts, the alien mental 
rhythms set up disturbance patterns 
similar to those caused by the war 
flowers. The deconditioned unit 
through whidi the Racemind was 
working began dreaming of wild bat- 


SUNBEAM CARESS 


43 



ties. Striking out at enemies, seeing 
blood pouring from wounds .... 
Breaking off contact, the Racemind 
analyzed the brief skirmish. The col- 
unm had been working on the weak- 
ness within the unit instead of try- 
ing to win by force. 

XIV 

THE FINAL CONFRONTATION 

C 4 X 70 U must stc^,” said Rren- 
I gyara, and then the Race- 
mind possessed her again. Her imiind 
was scarred and broken, and as 
soon as the old conditioning re- 
turned she knew that she was des- 
tined for the dream caverns. Be- 
side the motionless crystals, the lime- 
green columns sank slowly into the 
ground. A yellow column had disap- 
peared in this way, the Racemind re- 
membered. Rrengyara’s recapture 
and the movement of the columns 
occurred simultaneously. The Race- 
mind chose that mome^ to >begin its 
assault on the light columns. 

The attack was concentrated on 
the tall white column which had 
accompanied Rrengyara. It was the 
most powerful column, (and the most 
important as a captive. Overwhelmed 
by the multilevel barrage of mental 
force, the white column’s mind fold- 
ed into nothingness, reappearing as 
a constituent of the Racemind. Di- 
recting its attack, through the white 
column, the Racemind seized the 
seven lime-green columns, which 
were still partially above ground. 
Then it absorbed the thirteen crys- 
tals, and lastly it repossessed ^e 
fruit bat. 


With every unit it gained, thd 
Racemind increased its effective 
power on the plateau. Using its 
new strength, it reached out for fur- 
ther minds — and stopped. All the 
free light columns and their slave 
creatures were united against the 
new threat to their independent sur- 
vival. It was a basic law of ecology 
that no two species *\rith identical 
environmental characteristics could 
exist together in a stable relation- 
ship; sooner or later one of the 
competing species would extermin- 
ate the other, directly or indirectly. 
Adapting this law to the current 
situation, the Racemind knew that 
a conflict between the two group 
consciousnesses was inevitable. The 
light columns had known it too, 
when Rrengyara said, “We must 
control you.” 

In every city of the ant civiliza- 
tion, millions of units went into the 
trance state which enabled the Race- 
mind to make full use of their men- 
tal energies. Above the dusty pla- 
teau, a time mirage appeared in the 
sky: a flying cross-shaped object 
made by the ancient humans, a 
thing of the past made visible by 
a freak of nature. The mirage shim- 
mered and vanished, and after that 
nothing moved save the timeless 
heat haze. The Racemind was ready 
for its final attack. 

The Raoemind’s consciousness 
cascaded out from the expedition 
and the other units, expanding across 
the plateau like a foaming wave 
sweeping over a beach. In its state 
of abnormal sensitivity the Race- 
mind was contacting every living 
thing in the mountains as its sphere 


44 


IF 



of awareness washed over them. The 
minor creatures were swallowed up 
immediately, but the light columns 
lesisted. Incredibly, they fought 
back. Without defending themselves, 
they assaulted the Racemind at the 
critical moment, tearing into it with 
great streams of energy. The Race- 
mind merged itself with the group 
mind of the columns; the contact 
brought it into the sun. As waves 
of desperate madness roared out 
from the columns, the Racemind 
was buffeted by burning images of 
the Bright Ways. It had seen the 
memories in the columns it had tak- 
en, but now it was living them. It 
was surrounded by golden streams of 
dazzling fire, surging torrents swirl- 
ing it into the flames. Emotions 
flashed through the Bright Ways, 
nourishing the pale parasites, creat- 
ing currents and turbulence on other 
energy levels. 

The vision faded slowly as the 
Racemind fought to regain control 
of itself. The light columns’ coun- 
terattack had almost succeeded. 
Now even the essential workers were 
falling into the trance state, giving 
their energies to the titanic strug- 
gle. One by one, the columns suc- 
cumbed to the Racemind. It grew 
stronger, and the enemy grew weak- 
er. Bumt-out units were dying in 
the cities, but the battle was near- 
ing its end. The Racemind en- 
globed the alien group conscious- 
ness, forcing it inward on itself, 
taking over its constituent creatures 
as it retreated. 

Suddenly there were too few light 
columns to maintain their mass 
mind, and it disintegrated. The final 


burst of agony mingled with despair- 
ing death-images of the Bright Ways. 
The Racemind would carry those 
last visions in its memories for all 
time. 

It was over. Numbed by the vio- 
lence of the conflict, the Racemind 
reawakened its units from the trance. 
Civilization began to function again 
as the units resumed their normal 
work. The light columns had been 
defeated, and the Racemind was 
alone once more. 

A s the changes continued, the 
world became more and more 
hostile to protoplasm. The ants at- 
tempted to create self-supporting 
subterranean cities, but all the un- 
derground colonies failed. The Race- 
mind was forced to seek shelter in 
the oceans, as the seamen had done 
thousands of years before. 

Time drifted on, and slowly the 
land surfaces became completely de- 
void of protoplasm. The Racemind 
divided into two: a major segment 
for the submarine civilization, and 
a minor segment which controlled 
the land creatures. Eventually the 
two parted completely, and only the 
grotesque monsters which crawled 
up the beaches to die showed that 
marine life still existed. 

The two intelligent land races, 
the crystals and the light columns, 
developed their characteristics of in- 
dependence and individualism un- 
til the land Racemind ceased to 
exist. The minor creatures — sun- 
bursts, rock hags, cave crystals, melt- 
ers and so on — retained group 
minds in many instances, although 
life forms such as fireballs and dust-

devils had been independent from 
the beginnin/g. The light columns 
never lost their desire to bring life 
to the inanimate materials of the 
Earth, and this was the main pur- 
pose of the civilization they founded. 
They worked to change their world 
into life. 

The virtual disappearance of pro- 
toplasm life was of no consequence 
— if anything it was an advantage, 
because the new creatures were far 
less limited in their choice of en- 
vironments. For instance, the dust 
devils could exist in any fluid med- 
ium, and sunbursts were even more 
adaptable. As conditions on Earth 
grew harsher, life evolved to fit the 
requirement for survival, and all the 
whle the light columns went on 
with their patient work. Rocks were 
brought to awareness in the heat- 
haze, pools of liquid shielded them- 
selves from evaporation with tele- 
kinetic barriers, and telepathic 
mountains called to each other 
across the burning deserts. Within 
the sleeping giants that were the 
oceans, protoplasm survived as a 
series of hideous parasites haunt- 
ing the mud flats. 

Long after the activation of the 
Earth’s crust had started, the crys- 
tals (began to die out. They were 
less stable than most creatures, and 
were either becoming sterile or 
changing into more adaptable al- 
lotropic forms. The light columns 
themselves had become sterile, but 
they rendered themselves immortal 
and continued their work without 
pause. No such altemaitive was open 
to the crystals, and their numiters 
grew ever smaller. 


T here was a legend about the 
death of <the last crystal: 

He was a lonely child, who never 
knew others of his kind. Brou^t 
up within the shield of a large cop- 
per sulphate polyhydrate pool, the 
last crystal was still immature when 
a block of pumice crashed through 
the riiield to kill the pool. Adult in 
body, a child in experience, the 
cry(^I had gained his knowledge 
of the world from fanciful stories 
told by the pool. The last crystal 
questioned the pumice and learn- 
ed that the block had been ejected 
by a volcano among the nearby 
mountains. The pool hod told him 
about such things, saying that the 
lava streams were Earth’s counter- 
parts of the Bright Ways. 

Leaving the fused mass which 
had been the pool, the crystal set 
off to find the volcano. 

He was directed to the right place 
by a disinterested mountain which 
prophesied an early death for him. 
He disregarded the prophecy and 
traveled on. At the foot of the 
volcano he met a dust-devil which 
warned him against ascending the 
ash-covered slopes. Again he ig- 
nored the advice. And just bdow 
the summit, when he was looking 
ahead at the smoke and glowing 
cinders pouring from the crater, his 
way was barred by a yellow light 
column. He protested and explained 
that he wished to immerse himself 
in lava, reliving his ancestral mem- 
ories of the Bright Ways. The li^t 
column only sighed, knowing that 
the columns had given their crea- 
tures this memory, and allowed the 
last crystal to pass.

Waves of heat pounded against 
the crystal as he dragged himsell 
•ver the rim. Clouds of gray smoke 
were billowing up around him, but 
several hundred feet below they 
were lit up by a warm orange- 
yellow glow. The crystal went 
crashing down the steep sides into 
the depths of the crater, chipping 
off flakes from his sides against the 
boulders. The volcano spoke to him,

IF • Short Story 


DEADUER SPECIE 

by DAVID A. KYLE 

Tfie aliens had a foolproof way 
of defeating Earth . almost! 


T he secret was enormous, but it 
was well kept. That is why Greg- 
ory MacKenzie — listed as Mars- 
man 87 of TEPEE and one of the 
thirty-seven Earth scientists on Mars 
— was, in his innocence, unprepared 
for his incredible confrontation. 

MacKenzie had been on Mars for 
ten months as part of the slowly ex- 
panding Terrestrial Expeditionary 
Party, Exobiological Exploration 
(TEPEE). The five-month outward- 
bound trip with the two-man Fron- 
tier-Four-29 crew had cut him off 
from his home planet psychologically 
as well as physically. His horizons 
had narrowed, not broadened, and 
with his sense of isolation had come 
an acceptance of the routine. 

The excitement had not left him, 
though. How could it, when he was 
325 elliptical million miles from 
home? He was still a pioneer, prob- 


ing the mysteries of the Solar Sys- 
tem. That was why thoughts of dis- 
honesty, deception and treachery had 
been left far behind in space on 
Earth. And why the aliens achieved 
complete success with him. 

T he “Injuns” kidnapped MacKen- 
zie one evening just before dark- 
ness. The TEPEE standard operat- 
ing procedure called for everyone to 
be inside when the Martian night 
came, except for specially planned 
assignments. The nighttime cold was 
inhospitable; there were plenty of 
things to keep the entire party busy 
indoors during the sleepless period. 
MacKenzie had completed his duties 
outside and was headed back to his 
solitary living capsule with some new 
geological samples to analyze before 
pushing back on the following day 
to the main base camp. The sun. 


69 



bright in light but feeble in warmth, 
had jumped down below the horizon 
suddenly, forcing MacKenzie to stop 
for a minute to uncloud his sunshade 
and allow his eyes to adjust Phobos 
was off on the edge of ^e low hills 
and Deimos was just climbing into 
the fantastically starry sky. 

The time was that moment, and 
the place was there, some two hun- 
dred meters from Im personal cap- 
sule, that MacKenzie, half-blinded, 
tired and no longer alert, was grab- 
bed by the aliens. 

MacKenzie was not a big man, 
but he was wiry strong. Because he 
was one of the very few bachelors, 
he felt the social constraints, especial- 
ly in the presence of the three wom- 
en, working wives of the long-term 
explorers. So he divided his spare 
time between books and calisthenics, 
keeping himself in top physical form. 
Although his head was large and 
well formed, his neck was so long 
and scraggy that his head seemed 
somehow deformed and disjointed 
from his thick shoulders. 

It was just at that prominent 
juncture of his neck and shoulders 
that the Injun hit him. The blow 
was on the unprotected fabricoid 
edging under his helmet The sharp 
needle went through the material in- 
to his skin, to paralyze him in an 
instant. As well conditioned as he 
was, he had no chance to defend 
himself nor to resist the drug. 

None of the TEPEE group had 
ever seen an Injun, or, for that mat- 
ter, any alien at all. None, that is 
except the commandant, the remark- 
able veteran of the Moon and Mars, 
now almost fifty years old. One 


month ago he had made a meticu- 
lously staged rendezvous with an In- 
jun contact party under top-secret 
instructions brought to him by a 
courier from Earth. When dealing 
with unknowns, wireless communi- 
cations were considered risky. 

The written message which the 
commandant of TEPEE main base 
camp “Little Earth” had received 
two years earlier, five months before 
Gregory MacKenzie had even ar- 
rived on the planet, was the most 
flabbergasting governmental com- 
munication he had ever received. 
In the typical gobbledygook of gov- 
ernment^ language the commandant 
was informed that an alien life form 
had contacted the Secretary General 
of the United Nations through the 
Lunar Investigation For Exobiology 
(LIFE) and had requested a con- 
ference to discuss the basis for a 
relationship between them and the 
Terrestrials. One conference had 
taken place eight months later at a 
Lunar LIFE site with a Special As- 
sistant to the Secretary General, who 
was a brilliant young lapanese. He 
had been especis^y chosen and rush- 
ed through the training necessary 
to get him back and forth aboard a 
Russian Voskhod. The meeting was 
carried out and the young Japanese, 
Mr. Mitshubi, prepared the diplo- 
matic work for a second and final 
meeting. 

The aliens would not agree to lo- 
cating the meeting on Terran soil. 
Nor again on the Moon, which they 
considered as virtually part of Earth. 
In fact, they want^ it not even 
within the Solar System, which they 
considered the natural front yard

IF 



of the Earthmen. However, when it 
was pointed out that the farthest 
point at which mankind had suc- 
ceeded in establishing himself, at 
this date, was Mars — why, then, 
the aliens agreed that the final meet- 
ing should be on Mars. They also 
insisted that someone in absolute 
authority should be sent to the con- 
ference to represent Earth, although 
a delegation of not more than three 
persons was to be permitted. The 
meeting was to be held within twelve 
to eighteen months. 

E arth, or at least most of the gov- 
ernments there concerned who 
knew about it, took the full eighteen 
months to arrange the conference. 
In the first place, the Secretary Gen- 
eral of the U.N. had made a very 
wise decision: he had informed only 
the permanent members of the 
curity Council of the overtures by a 
non-Earth civilization. This was his 
cautious attempt to develop the sit- 
uation slowly, with a minimum of 
confusion and panic. Those Securi- 
ty Council members behaved in a 
remarkably restrained and intelli- 
gent manner; they kept the secret 
to themselves and sat down upon 
the situation with the tightest form 
of security. Only the immediate 
rulers of each of their countries 
were a party to the secret. They 
planned to negotiate the treaty and 
then throw the entire situation open 
to the world to consider, discuss 
and then accept or reject. 

One of the treaty provisions, spe- 
cifically made by the aliens, was 
that there would never be any fra- 
ternization between aliens and Earth- 


men. Following the final personal 
contact of the treaty conference 
there would then be only radio or 
some such other contact. The aliens 
explained it simply by saying that 
the Earthmen weren’t “psychologi- 
cally ready” for galactic association. 
The treaty would provide how the 
two species would be kept apart; 
mathematical boundary lines would 
be calculated and agreed upon; each 
side would stay within its own ter- 
ritory imtil the treaty was negotiated. 

Somebody tagged the aliens as 
“the Injuns.” The allusion, of 
course, was to the ancient American 
problem with the opening of the 
New World. No one knew whether 
or not there would be “trouble” with 
the “Injuns.” For that matter, no 
one knew yet if the aliens would 
turn out to be inferiors, equals or 
superiors to mankind. 

The U.S. and Soviet governments 
agreed that the Secretary General 
could be relied upon to negotiate 
for both their interests, and, inciden- 
tally, for the interests of the rest 
of the world. However, the Secre- 
tary General was too old to make 
the trip. Others took his place. 

The first assistant had arrived on 
a regular Frontier-Four shot three 
months ago. He was an American. 
The second had arrived six weeks 
ago in an extra Frontier-Four cap- 
sule which had been launched by 
a Soviet Vosnik rocket. He was a 
Russian” The actual negotiator, the 
Special Assistant to the Secretary 
General who had all the real power, 
was due to touch down in one day, 
the day after MacKenzie’s undiscov- 
ered ^dnapping. 


DEADLIER SPECIE

Officially all of this had absolute- 
ly nothing to do with Marsman-34 
Gregory MacKenzie. 

Except that he was to be the 
aliens’ secret weapon.- 

H e found that out almost imme- 
diately upon being wakened 
from his drugged sleep. He had 
been pulled into what looked like 
the control room of a spacecraft, 
vaguely like the American Frontier- 
Four but without a single recogniz- 
able control switchv The room, about 
twelve feet in diameter, was pleas- 
antly lit from an unknown source, 
and three aliens stood leaning over 
MacKenzie. 

At first he thought they were hu- 
man beings dressed up in a new 
kind of spacesuit, not quite lame 
fabric and not quite armor, in a 
sparkling though faint tint of lav- 
ender. They seemed very skinny 
with long slender arms and hands 
and fingers, and their heads were en- 
cased in a smooth, highly reflective 
ball of the same violet-purple metal- 
lic sheen. There were large opened 
visors, with gaping shadows which 
at first seemed occupied by stan- 
dard human features but appear- 
ed to grow more strange and 
alien each time MacKenzie looked 
at them. There were eyes, glinting, 
all dark as though cornea and pupil 
were blended, with no whites show- 
ing. There was a nose for each, but 
only a small fleshy bump, with no 
nostrils, more suggestive than actual 
such as on a doll’s face. From im- 
der the eyes, slashing down across 
the cheeks, reversing themselves 
around the thin mouths, were a se- 


ries of Z-shaped wrinkles, graded 
from the first large and deep one to 
the smallest, faintest one. The top 
bar of the deepest Z-wrinkle gave 
each eye a serious, provocative 
squint, while the bottom bar seemed 
to suggest a controlled, determined 
grin. 

MacKenzie was smart and imag- 
inative. He very soon concluded that 
they were alien people. Not know- 
ing that higher authorities on Earth 
already knew of their existence, 
MacKenzie felt a terrible burden 
of responsibility building upon him. 
What he did might be irrevocably 
good — or bad — for the existence 
of the human race. 

“Can we communicate?” Mac- 
Kenzie said, daring to hope for the 
best. 

One of the creatures shook his 
helmet in a positive way and said, 
“We understand English. We can 
speak English. That is the very thing 
we desire — communicate.” Before 
MacKenzie could ask a second ques- 
tion the central figure hung his 
hands on each shoulder, almost as 
a human would grasp his coat la- 
pels or hook his thumbs in his vest 
while speaking, and delivered a 
quick lecture. 

The aliens were friendly, were 
about to enter negotiations with the 
Terrestrials, would after their con- 
sultations release certain facts about 
themselves. Meanwhile they had in- 
vited MacKenzie into a preliminary 
conference with them; they needed 
twenty-four hours with a human be- 
ing informally before spending days 
or weeks with the Official Human 
Being formally.

IF 



“In the first place,” MacKenzie 
said, when there was an end to the 
lecture, “You didn’t invite me — 
you took me here by force. That’s 
the worst way to begin. It’s not 
friendly. To be a friend one has to 
act friendly.” Their voices sounded 
friendly enough, though, MacKenzie 
thought. Soft and vibrant, even 
warm, but unfortunately stilted, if 
not downright mechanical. 

“We weren’t unfriendly. Just 
practical. We wanted to avoid the 
emotional disturbance of our meet- 
ing. To save time.” First one and 
then another seemed to be speaking 
these sentences in turn. MacKenzie 
wasn’t certain. Perhaps the middle 
alien really was doing all the talk- 
ing. “Now that we are here, we 
are inviting you to talk.” 

“In the second place,” MacKen- 
zie said, “this is no time to talk — 
if what you say is true. Start your 
introductions tomorrow without any 
preconceived notions. Discover each 
other tomorrow in all innocence.” 
MacKenzie felt his eyebrows go up 
at the recognition of his own 
thought. Damn if it didn’t ring the 
bell with solid truth! “It seems to 
me you think I can give you some 
information which will help your 
side against my side.” MacKenzie 
didn’t see any reaction to that. “I 
don’t know what’s going on. I’m 
not one of our planet’s leaders. I 
can’t be of any help.” 

All Ithree aliens waggled their 
heads in unison, although Mac- 
Kenzie was not clear as to what the 
movements meant. “But that’s just 
why we want to talk to you. You’re 
an average man. You represent the 


true feelings of your race. You — ** 

MacKenzie listened. 

MacKenzie talked. 

MacKenzie listened. 

MacKenzie talked. 

MacKenzie suddenly realized that 
they had been talking for many, 
many minutes. For hours! 

“I refuse to say anything more,” 
he said. He felt exceedingly angry 
at the belief that he had been ex- 
ploited without, somehow, being 
able to resist. ‘Take me back. Now!” 

The three aliens looked at each 
other, nodding and making whisper- 
ing noises. 

“We have had a useful talk. You 
have proved extremely knowledge- 
able in the use of the techniques of 
dialectic and rhetoric. You will be 
returned this morning before the 
meeting.” 

“Why are you conducting this 
clandestine interrogation?” Mac- 
Kenzie asked, being as calm and 
reasonable as he could be. 

“You are the first human being 
with whom we have had personal 
contact,” one of the aliens said. 
“Obviously we would be poorly 
prepared if we had not met and 
talked with at least one of you.” The 
Z-wrinkles around all three mouths 
spread wider apart in awkward, gro- 
tesque imitation of large grins. “But 
even more important, frankly, we 
have been analyzing the human 
thought processes. We have been 
discovering how you think. For ex- 
ample — ” the middle alien held 
up a slender metallic-sheathed hand 
and waggled it like the most prosaic 
of lecturers — “we have been able 
to gather some of your more inti- 


DEADLIER SPECIE 


73 



mate resources upon which you 
build your wisdom and knowledge.” 
The hand, with one extended finger, 
continued waggling. “You told us 
much, under questioning, which you 
do not now remember. But we also 
received much of what you didn’t 
verbalize, more of ethos than of 
facts, through what you yourself 
use as an extrasensory perception or 
intuition.” 

“You don’t think you can know 
the human race after just a few 
hours interrogating one human be- 
ing?” MacKenzie blustered. He 
wasn’t at all sure but what they 
could. ^ 

“Yes,” said the alien. “At least 
for our purposes. We know how you 
think. Aristotelian logic, I believe 
you call it, with some tendency to 
lay out arguments in the more com- 
plex, more analytical, Toulminian 
form. Given a certain premise we 
believe it would be very easy to pre- 
dict the course your thoughts would 
follow in the development of human 
logic. Because.of this we should tri- 
umph at the conference beginning in 
six hours.” 

M acKenzie was distressed by the 
choice of the word “triumph,” 
but he saw the validity of the alien 
philosophy — and also its implica- 
tions. The secrecy confirmed their 
evaluation. Perhaps he might be able 
to get his enlightening experience to 
the attention of the Earth represen- 
tatives before any harm was done. 
Or would the aliens kill him to pre- 
vent his talking? 

“If you release me before the 
conference, what is to prevent me 


telling of our meeting?” He kept his 
voice steady and friendly. 

“We will burn out your memo- 
ries.” 

“Burn out . ?” Despite his ef- 
fort at self-control, MacKenzie was 
engulfed in a hot flash of terror 
and panic. They were quick to re- 
assure him that it was neither pain- 
ful nor dangerous. 

“But you’ve told me you were 
seeking trust and understanding. 
Cooperation. You are practicing de- 
ceit.” 

“We are not immoral.” The three 
heads each made several solemn 
negative shakes. “We are realists. 
We must use every weapon that we 
have.” 

MacKenzie’s terror flooded back, 
stronger even than before. “Do you 
threaten war?” 

All three aliens stiffened and re- 
coiled slightly. “Nol” the three 
voices simultaneously protested. “We 
do not use violence. Our power 
needs no war machines. We fight 
our battles with rhetoric. We rely 
on persuasion based upon psycho- 
logical precepts. If we win, we have 
our way. If we lose, we simply ac- 
cept co-existence. You yourself 
know that ^winning the peace’ is 
the real test. And as we now know 
the human mind, because you are 
typical of the men with whom we 
vnJl deal, it is inevitable that we 
shall gain our ends.” 

“Do you consider me — us — 
naive, stupid . ?” 

“No, just mechanistic. Obsessed 
with computerized, scientific logic. 
Predictable. One day your race will 
recognize that we are — ” the 

IP 


74 



spokesman groped for a term — ” 
we are nonhuman syllogisticians.” 
MacKenzie was desperately look- 
ing for some reassuring flaw in the 
alien strategy. “Predictable.” If only 
he were the half-witted brother in 
the story plot, they would themselves 
be deceived. Or if they had mistak- 
enly interviewed a human pet or an 
ersatz-human servo-mech, thinking 
it was the true, intelligent life form 
of Earth. But there was no bizarre 
misrepresentation — he, MacKen- 
zie, was indeed a truly represen- 
tative man . 

As his thoughts were racing, he 
saw a hypodermic-like instrument 
materialize in the hands of one of 
them. He had no chance to fight 
the sudden spray injection which 
burst upon his bare face, but the 
infallibility of the aliens’ reasoning 
represented by the word “predict- 
able!” was the last burning thought 
in his burning brain. 

G regory MacKenzie, minor mem- 
ber of the TEPEE group, was 
asleep in his capsule when the con- 


ference began. He would be found 
later, unharmed, although suffering 
from a severe and incurable case of 
amnesia. He would not be able to 
report that they had kept him for 
another six hours, almost up to the 
time of the conference, talking to 
his drugged mind. Nor would he 
know or even guess at the important 
consequences of his interrogation. 
He had not been the unwitting be- 
trayer of bis own kind. Indeed it 
might be said he had betrayed the 
syllogisticians themselves by the ir- 
refutable truth of his own predicta- 
bility. 

For on that fateful morning, when 
the future of space-conquering hu- 
manity and its Solar System was be- 
ing dedicated, there arrived at the 
conference site the Chief Representa- 
sentative for Terra, the Special As- 
sistant to the Secretary General of the 
United Nations of Earth. The 
dignified, middle-aged human being 
heading the delegation of three was 
the esteemed Suhawni Pachtow. She 
was very attractive — and all wom- 
an. END

pointed beard and the radiation scar 
across his face — had gone through 
Chute Five. To Y this indicated that 
the intelligence network .... of the 
West American States was right in at 
least some of their guesswork. Action 
on Bondman Y’s part was vital before 
his query reached the Ameradian 
Republic. 

Yet he could not simply arrest the 
Ameradian. This was Cefus terri- 
tory: the Central Empire of the For- 
mer United States. 

Considering the problem of a 
police force that would incarcerate 
a West American Bondman as quick 
as an Ameradian spy and possibly 
quicker, Y came to the conclusion he 
had been working up to for some 
time. He was going to need help. 

Potential help went by in the form 
of a very nice shape. He admired 
the blonde hair above the white 
jersey and the smooth hip action 
beneath the tight green slacks. Yes, 
if his estimate of the situation was 
correct, there might be one of his 
allies. He tried concentrating on the 
rear view to the exclusion of all other 
distractions. It aroused more bear- 
able dreams than did the other ma- 
jor item in his field of vision, the 
long sausage with pulsating greenish- 
gray sides and bulbous brown croco- 
dilian head equipped with single yel- 
low-glass eye and long-stilled mouth 
that it was said had clomped only 
foliage. 

As usual, what he wanted most to 
exclude came up fully into his con- 
sciousness: the crawlers and his illog- 
ical aversion to them. 

The crawlers had come from Ve- 
nus. Between World Wars Three and 
CATERPILLAR EXPRESS 


Four, just before Four. After Four 
there had of course been no manu- 
facture of spacecraft — or a host of 
other once necessary things. Earth’s 
resources were too exhausted. 

Enter the crawlers. 

T he size of the creatures varied. 

Like fish, they grew indefinitely. 
Unlike fish, they had no natural life 
span. An ama2dng discovery . 
and the crawlers were not all! Co- 
discovered on Venus were the ruins 
of ancient cities. There had been an 
intelligent race on Venus — a race 
that left abundant wall carvings. 

The intelligent Venusians had not 
been crawlers; rather they appeared 
to have been giant cockroaches. 
Studying pictographs of a particular- 
ly scabrous kind, a linguist remarked 
that while the Venusians had a nifty 
mode of conduct, it appeared that 
they became miffed when proper rit- 
uals were ignored. Thus from nifty 
and miffed came the name Earth- 
men applied to the vanished Venus- 
ians: Miffti. 

Had it not been for the Miffti’s 
pictographs, men would never have 
dreamed that crawlers would prove 
to be a solution to Earth’s transpor- 
tation problems. Yet the pictographs 
were very specific. Miffti had grown 
crawlers to size and worked on them 
surgically. What the Miffti could do, 
Man could do — if he wanted. 

Man wanted. After World War the 
Fifth, he needed. There was no way 
out, even if the moralists had had 
a point or two. But the moralists had 
not. The pain centers in crawlers 
were on the order of those found 
in earthworms. 

77 



Thus had biocarpentry, bioelec- 
tronics, biomechanics, bioplumbing 
and a lot of other bios come into 
the language. The crawler flesh 
proved to be readily adaptable — 
for human needs as well as Miffti. 
There was no big problem that the 
biotechnicians could not solve and 
the crawlers’ flexible hides proved to 
be wonderfully adaptable shields for 
the human parasites. Thus areas of 
the planet befouled with radiation 
and other poisons were conveniently 
traversed, in comfort. Except by 
those who had their illogical aver- 
sions. 

“Crawler Nine-O-Five will crawl in 
five minutes!” 

Y mentally shook himself, took 
firm hold of his travel bag and 
moved from around the pylon. 
Chute Five was now empty. All the 
other passengers had gone aboard and 
it was too late for any to come out 
without his seeing them. There was 
now no reason to keep concealed 
from the transparent ports set in the 
crawler’s side for the use of the 
passengers. Y went aboard. 

Inside, Y chose a seat in a day 
coach section and looked back to see 
the portal closing like an enormous 
sphincter. It was a sphincter — 
adapted. Suddenly ill, he rose, got the 
nod from the conductor and headed 
for the relief erf a washroom. 

A little later, refreshed and almost 
used to the swaying motion 
beneath his feet, Y left the wash- 
room, passed the heavy-set, ruddy- 
faced conductor with an apologetic 
smile, and took himself into the 
area where a few passengers had 

78 


private compartments. He went to the 
door, whose number he had learned 
from a bribed ticket-seller, and 
rapped. 

The blonde answered. Behind her 
stood a hairy-faced gorilla of a 
blond man and a red-haired smaller 
man who more nearly resembled an 
orangutan. Y thought about the ir- 
radiated landscape they would be 
rippling through and wondered if 
the ancestors of these two had come 
from there. 

‘^Yes?” the blonde said. 

“Your name is Yvonne Bohne,” Y 
said. “The big guy is your brother 
Barney. Neither you or your red- 
haired contact — Mr. Philips, I be- 
lieve — are Cefus citizens. You see, 
I know who you are, and — ” 

“Come in,” Philips said, uncover- 
ing a gun. It was one of those that 
fired small explosive shells that were 
nonrecoverable. Only government 
agents were supposed to have them. 

Y entered. He stood calmly once- 
overing the compartment as Yvonne 
closed the door behind him. “I won- 
dered why you got fresh,” she said. 
“Now I imow.” 

“You fail to flatter yourself,” Y 
said. “On the hotel’s sunroof you 
were quite enchanting.” 

“Thank you,” she said, obviously 
flattered. 

“What you want?” Barney said. 
“You a cop or — ?” 

“Just let’s say I know about cor- 
bacco,” Y said. “Mutated cornsilk 
has its qualities when added to mu- 
tated tobacco, but then every cor- 
bacco addict knows as much.” 

“You’re no corbacco head!” 
Philips said. 


IF 



“Quite correct,” Y said. “Fm from 
West America. Our worries are 
crawlers, not traffic.” 

“So?” a reddish eyebrow rose. 
“You may call me Y,” Y said. 
“You may also save your question — 
no, I’m not interested in your oper- 
ations in Lexiville. I am interested 
in enlisting your help.” 

“HelpI” Barney was incredulous. 
“Help in a matter that will con- 
cern you. Crawlers have disappeared 
into the dead zones — passenger 
crawlers from West America.” 

“So?” Philips seemed stuck with 
his one question. 

Y studied the man’s wizened face. 
“You mean you want your corbacco 
hijacked?” 

“Hijacked? You think — ** 

“I think someone has gotten away 
with full crawlers. If it’s not or- 
ganized Clime, then it’s — ” 
“Ameradial” Yvonne said. 

i^'Tj'xactly,” Y said. ”Ameradia if 
^ not organized crime. In 
either case, your operation as well 
as West America’s can be a loser.” 
“It ain’t organized crime,” Philips 
said. “Fd know. So that’s what hap- 
pened to that shipment! Disappeared, 
and then the government of West 
America just kept shut about it?” 
“So far,” Y admitted. “Everyone 
knows it takes a long time to get 
word across country. The radio sta- 
tions would be a help if they could 
be rebuilt. But with metal so val- 
uable and the mail service so slow 
and unreliable — ” 

“We know,” Philips said. “Cop,” 
he added. 

“Agent,” Y corrected. 

CATERPILLAR EXPRESS 


Y looked from face to face. Only 
on Yvonne’s did he think he saw a 
spark of sympathy. He considered the 
orangutan, moderated his voice to 
its sincerest and said: “A man who 
has a pointed beard and a radiation 
scar across his face is on board. 
He’s the master spy Ameradia had in 
West America.” 

“So?” 

“He ransacked the files of the 
West American Crawler Corpora- 
tion. Obviously he’s involved is this. 
If I can get him and make him 
talk — ” 

“You think that you can end hi- 
jacking?” 

“My government can. Ev«i if 
there’s war,” he said. “No nation can 
interfere with the crawlers of other 
nations. This has got to be stopped. 
Don’t you see?” 

“Yeah,” Philips said. “The syn- 
dicate can’t afford to lose any more 
boys and any more comsilk.” 

“Then you’ll help me?” Y knew 
he must sound pathetically eager. 
“All I need is help in getting the 
guy before he reaches Ameradian 
territory. I need him alive and I 
may need professional help in get- 
ting him to talk and in getting the 
information back to West American 
authorities.” 

’Too tough for you, Y?” Philips 
said. 

‘Too clever’! Y admitted. “He 
knows Fm after him, and he’s a won- 
der at staying hid and in finding dis- 
guises. If I’d had the help I needed 
he’d never have gotten aboard this 
crawler.” 

Philips considered the gun he held. 
“We’U get him,” he said. 


79 



“Alive,” Y warned. “It’s best we 
break up in pairs so he doesn’t sus- 
pect we’re all searching for him. 
We’ll have to check every compart- 
ment until we find him. There’s a 
standard excuse — we’re each look- 
ing for a friend we thought entered 
the compartment. When you find a 
male who seems to fit the description, 
one of you keep track of him and 
the other come and find Yvonne and 
me. We’ll be searching the parts of 
the crawlers where you, Barney, and 
you, Philips, are not supposed to go. 
If I can, 1 will also enlist the aid 
of the crawler personnel. This man 
has got k) be found. It still may be 
possible to save what there is of 
world peace if we can find him soon 
enough. If we don’t find him soon 
enough, I suspect everyone aboard 
is going to end up working in the 
Ameradian petrified wood mines.” 

n 

4 CT guess,” Yvonne said cutely as 

Ashe and Y neared the stomach 
passage, “that you cops don’t get 
next to a real blonde too often?” 

Y continued to hold tight to her 
hand and ignored the slur on Bond- 
men as well as the sign that read: 
Crawler Personnel Only, What seem- 
ed the amplified sound of a churning 
washing machine became louder as 
they neared the stomach proper. 
There was no excuse for a pair of 
bewildered passengers to be here, so 
regardless of whether his man was 
in the cavity, Y must reveal him- 
self. 

As they emerged, via the passage’s 
muscular contractions, Y took a deep 

80 


breath of the stomach’s putrid air 
and glanced quickly about at the 
maze of tubing and the giant reser- 
voir connecting with the huge beast’s 
digestive system. 

“Hey, your 

He turned to see a young man 
with a high-peaked stoker’s cap on 
his head glaring at 'them. Then, as 
Yvonne also turned, the stoker’s 
scowl vanished. As the crawler em- 
ployee sought for words, Y con- 
gratulated himself on his astuteness 
in bringing Yvonne along. “Sorry, sir 
and madani, but unless you’re crawler 
personnel, you’re not allowed in here. 
It’s a government safety regulation.” 

“Good!” Y said. “My credential.” 
And he flipped his wallet open. 

“Bureau of . Bondmen. Western 
States of the Americas,” the chief 
stoker read. He would, Y surmised, 
prefer to be known as a bio-main- 
tenance engineer in charge of biofuel 
injection. “Well, I’m sorry, sir, but 
whatever your request, I can be of 
only slight assistance to you. Cefus 
neutrality policy.” 

“I know,” Y said, knowing full 
well that if anything could penetrate 
this neutralist hide, it would be a 
show of interest on Yvonne’s part. 
“You are not allowed to assist in any 
way either an agent from the West 
American States or from the Amera- 
dian Republic. Yet this young lady is, 
in a sense, your country’s.” 

“I’ve always heard you spies have 
no scruples about lying,” the chief 
stoker said. 

“But — but — ” Yvonne said. 

“Brad,” the chief stoker said. 
“Brad Streeter.” 

Yvonne cast blue eyes on Brad 

IP 



Streeter. “What this man says is 
true, Mr. Streeter. It’s true, I’ve lived 
in the West American States for a 
number of years, but my brother 
Barney and I moved back to the 
Central Empire after our parents 
died. My name, by the way, is 
Yvonne Bohne.” 

“Pleased to meet you. Miss Boh- 
ne,” Streeter said. “Now this, eh, 
trouble?” 

She smiled, just as though she had 
rehearsed it. “Well, Mr. Streeter, I 
could lie to you and say my life 
has been threatened, but what it real- 
ly amount to is that I’ve reason to 
believe that all our lives are threaten- 
ed. All the lives of those aboard this 
crawler.” 

“Remarkable if true,” Streeter 
said. 

“But it is true,” Yvonne said. “My 
brother and his business associate 
have information that a West Amer- 
ican crawler never arrived at its desti- 
nation. Now Mr. Jones — who I 
knew briefly under his real name 
while I lived in the Western States 
— ^has evidence that an Ameradian 
agent who knows what happened is 
aboard. And could be disguised as 
anyone — including crawler person- 
nel.” 

Streeter looked at Y. “You want 
my help in finding your man? You 
know I can’t give you much with- 
out violating my neutrality.” 

“That’s the idea,” Y said. “You 
can tell me about the crawler’s per- 
sonnel. If the Ameradian is one of 
them, I can maybe get him before 
he commits irreparable sabotage.” 

“Sabotage?” Streeter looked un- 
easily from beneath his cap brim. 
CATERPILLAR EXPRESS 


“You really think there might be 
sabotage?” 

“A desperate man,” Y said, “may 
do anything. Besides, there’s a West 
American crawler missing.” 

S treeter moved aside so they could 
see deeper into the stomach cav- 
ity. “All I know is who’s here, sir. 
As you can see, there’s my partner — ” 
he nodded at a thick-bodied man 
checking some gauges — “and the 
new nutrition expert.” 

“This new man — ” Y looked 
up at the catwalk — “he’s there?” 
“That’s him,” Streeter said. “Si- 
lent sort of fellow. Just came to 
work.” 

Y studied the man on the cat- 
walk. The nutrition expert’s back 
was turned, and Y saw clearly that 
the cap he wore was pulled down 
tight over the back of his skull. Was 
that just because of the occasional 
drops of water condensation falling 
from the nutrient pipes, he won- 
dered — or was there something 
more? He waited until the man had 
turned from looking down into the 
vat that fed a large bag by hydraulic 
pressure. The eyes the man looked 
back with were clear and rather 
blank; far too small a man to be 
the master spy Y was after. 

He turned to the chief stoker. 
“You know of a man who’s built 
a lot like your partner but has a 
half-moon scar on the left side of 
his face and a nose that’s a little 
flat? A man who might sometimes 
wear a beard?” 

Streeter shrugged. “I don’t know 
anyone who fits that description. 
Charlie, my partner, has been on 

81 



this crawler far longer than I have. 
I imagine from what you said that 
your man would have to be new on 
the job?** 

“Or disguised as someone who’s 
not new,” Y said. “His disguises pass 
more than casual observation.” 

“I don’t know anyone suspicious,” 
Streeter said. “Not if this new man 
is all right.” 

“You keep your eye on this new 
man until we know,” Y said. “The 
agent I’m after always works alone, 
but this could be a time when he’s 
made an exception.” 

“I’ll cooperate, sir. Within regu- 
lations, of course.” 

“One other thing I’d better warn 
you about,” Y said. “If you notice 
anything different about the way the 
crawler is responding — anything 
at all — you must let me know im- 
mediately.” 

“Yes, sir. I’ll do that, sir.” 

Y slapped the chief stoker lightly 
on the arm and pulled Yvonne back 
into the passageway. A little later, 
after a fruitless search of the crowded 
couches, they returned through the 
segments to her door. Y saw the con- 
ductor coming toward them down the 
hall but thought nothing of it. Then 
he saw that Yvonne was having diffi- 
culty with the door and helped her. 

Inside, he saw her blue eyes widen 
and felt her clutch his hand. He 
didn’t blame her: there was a streak 
of blood running right across the 
compartment to a madeup bed. On 
the bed, face staring upwards, was a 
man Y thought a complete stranger. 
The man was dead — very dead. 
There was a small leaky hole in the 
stranger’s forehead. 

82 


m 

Y clicked the lock on the door 
and went forward to examine the 
dead man. He was, Y quickly de- 
termined, shot twice with explosive 
shells: the first shot had gone in 
the lungs and the second had en- 
tered the forehead. The man was 
approximately the same size as the 
spy he was after, but there was no 
cheek scar and no sign that there 
had ever been either scar or beard. 

Someone rapped gently at the 
door. Y stood aside, pulled Yvonne 
into the circle of his arm. He listened, 
breathing shallowly. He dipped for 
his gun as a key turned in the lock 
and the door opened. Facing them 
was the conductor. 

“Greetings,” said the conductor, 
and his eyes followed the blood. 

Y saw no gun, motioned the man 
inside and shut the door. “You know 
what is going on?” he asked. 

“Some,” the conductor admitted. 
“What I don’t know, I’m starting to 
guess.” 

“Well, start talking. Who’s the 
dead man?” 

The conductor sighed, most wear- 
ily. ‘Take a look at me, Y,” he sug- 
gested. “At my face and my build.” 
Y did. At first he saw nothing and 
then, as the conductor rubbed a 
skin-tinted paste from his cheek 
with the back of his hand, Y knew 
at last. It seemed stupid to say it: 
“You’re — ” 

“The man you were trailing. Yes. 
I’m the one burgled the Ministry of 
Transportation and the headquarters 
of the West American Crawler Cor- 
poration.” 


IF 



“But — ” Y didn’t like this at all. 
“If you’re my man, then why — ?” 
“Why the dead man and why am 
I here? Complicated. More than I 
fear you may appreciate.” 

‘Try me,” Y said. 

The conductor walked over to the 
corpse. “This poor imfortunate* is 
a crawler employee. Specifically, he 
was the rightful conductor. I had 
sought to obtains his cooperation, 
but he unfortunately resisted me.” 
“You shot him? Murdered him?” 
Y asked. Even for an Ameradian, 
it was a new low. 

“Nothing else to do,” the spy 
said. “Nothing at all. He was in 
the way and he wouldn’t cooperate. 
Unfortunately he was also very 
strong and thought he knew a little 
about defense.” The conductor’s 
hand leaped suddenly out, and Y felt 
his wrist sting and saw his gun fly 
from his fingers; the Ameradian 
caught the gun in mid-flight and 
stood back, aiming it at them. 

“Yes, my dear Y, I dare say that 
I acted exactly as you would under 
similar circumstances. The differ- 
ence is that I’m a master spy. While 
you are — professionally speaking 
— not much better than an amateur.” 
Y held his throbbing wrist and 
scowled. “You tempt me to think 
you’re right,” he said. 

“But you still want to know? 
Right, Y. My code name is three 
letters while yours is just one. D O X 
of the Ameradian Republic.” 

“A filthy spy!” Yvonne said, and 
spat in the master spy’s direction. 

“Also,” D O X said, “an Amera- 
dian. My parents were Toronto citi- 
zens, and my great-grandparents help- 
CATEftPILLAR EXPRESS 


ed in annexing of the old state ter- 
ritory.” 

“Filth!” Yvonne said. She spat 
again. 

“Young lady,” BOX said, ‘T 
must ask you not to do that on 
pain of getting your face slapped. I 
am, remember, not only a filthy spy 
but also a very unsanitary murderer.” 

i^XTou’re good, all right,” Y ac- 
JL knowleged. “But my side is 
wiser than you think.” 

“Yes?” D O X’s thick eyebrows 
rose. 

“We knew the Ameradian Repub- 
lic had their master spy at work. We 
also suspected why.” 

‘Tell me, Y.” 

“You Ameradians are troubled by 
the same thing we are — crawlers 
disappearing with all passengers and 
cargo.” 

BOX nodded. “Very good. That 
is right to a point.” 

“A point?” Y still did not like it 
“The point is,” BOX said, “that 
we Ameradians know nothing and 
you West Americans know nothing. 
If we knew, we’d have put a stop to 
it. But now, we know that it isn’t 
smugglers or hijackers as we had as- 
sumed. There’s no West American/- 
Ameradian crime syndicate power- 
ful enough. I know** 

“Hmmm, you know, huh? And 
that’s why you killed this real con- 
ductor and took his place?” 

“Uh-huh,” BOX said. “Bigger 
than that afraid. Also more 
incredible. Y, come over here and, 
look at this corpse.” 

“I’ve looked,” Y said. 

“Come look again. At the back of 

83 



his head. Over here, if you please.” 

Y moved, cautiously. He recog- 
nized a man of unusual proficiency 
who would not hesitate to take the 
life of an enemy counterspy. 

“You’d better not look, young 
lady,” BOX said. “You look, Y.” 

Y looked and then looked away 
quickly. He felt his gorge rise. 
“M-my God!” he said. 

4 4 A greed,” BOX said. “Nasty, 

^ huh?” 

Y swallowed and turned the head 
back the way it had been. “Just like 
the crawler,” he said. “A good-sized 
passage and — ” 

“You noticed the slime too, I as- 
sume?” 

Y nodded while he mentally curs- 
ed B O X. “I noticed something — 
greenish, pulpy, with some black hairs 
or filaments.” 

“And you’re wondering what it 
means, aren’t you, Y? Outside of 
the fact that there was something 
there that my bullet hit.” 

“I know what it means,” he said. 
“I’m afraid the officials at all levels 
have known — unconsciously — for 
quite some time. I knew, and yet—” 

“Yet you wanted to deny it. Yes.” 

“Will you two please tell me what 
you are talking about?” Yvonne de- 
manded. 

Y looked at her. “This man — 
the former conductor on this crawler 
— he was, uh, controlled by some- 
thing. The way we, uh, control the 
crawler.” 

“That’s not possible!” she said 
promptly. 

“Isn’t it?” Y said. “Evidently you 
don’t know that the cerebellum and 

84 


brainstem are quite accessible from 
the back, and through them the 
basal ganglia. Walking, eating, all 
activities we perform automatically, 
are controlled from there. As for the 
cortex — a large part of it can be 
trimmed away and a man can live 
without and apparently function 
normally. Fibers can be cut that lead 
from the brainstem to the cortex and 
what’s left is a sort of non-thinking 
man who reasons and responds only 
on the most primitive level. It would 
be possible to control a man so that 
he even speaks, assuming the con- 
troller was bright enough.” 

“You mean — little creatures — 
inside the head?” 

“Miffti,” Y said. “Very small 
Miffti. Smaller than we ever be- 
lieved possible.” 

“About cockroach size,” BOX 
said. 

Yvonne made a gagging noise. 

“Which means,” said Y, “that 
there are more? More aboard, may- 
be, inside heads?” 

BOX nodded. “The harboring 
heads wear bandages on the back. 
Or something as concealing as band- 
ages. Toupees, maybe.” 

“We’d better look,” Y said. 
“Search all the crawler personnel and 
all the passengers.” 

“And we’d better hurry,” BOX 
said. “Before whatever happened to 
those other crawlers happens to this 
one. Oh, here, Y, here’s your gun 
back.” 

Y took the weapon and tucked 
it away. He turned to see Barney 
and Philips. Both men were look- 
ing incredulously at the corpse. Y, 
taking charge as he felt he must, 

IF 



quickly explained to the two and 
apologized on behalf of D O X for 
messing up the compartment. “But 
we’ve got to make a thorough check,” 
he finished, “and that’s where you 
two can help. Assuming — ” 

P hilips yelped and so did Barney 
as Y reached out quickly and 
yanked their hair. Philips’s came off; 
Barney’s didn’t. Underneath Philips’s 
toupee a bald head gleamed. 

“Give me that!” Philips demand- 
ed. 

Y handed back the hair piece. 
“Had to make sure,” he said. He 
glanced at D O X’s heavy head of 
dark hair and Yvonne’s blonde hair- 
do. “I believe that in this matter we 
can all trust one another.” 

“If they’re all like this — ” 
D O X indicated the corpse — 
“you can tell fairly quickly. This guy 
acted more like a sleepwalker than 
an alert crawler employee. Keep that 
in mind.” 

They broke up. Y and Yvonne re- 
turned, by devious route, to the 
stomach cavity. In the outside pass- 
ageway Y pulled her close and whis- 
pered: “Now remember — don’t 
blab if I capture this one. Your 
country’s security is at stake and 
if I make a capture before D O X 
does — ” 

“I understand,” she said. “Damned 
Ameradians! If they get the ad- 
vantage of we West Americans — ” 
“Exactly!” he said, almost be- 
lieving it. The truth was, of course, 
that he didn’t want to be put down 
professionally. Yet there was, he 
eagerly accepted, great truth in what 
Yvonne had said. The contractions 
CATERPILLAR EXPRESS 


carried them onto the solid flooring. 

Y looked about, saw the chief 
stoker and called to him: “Where’s 
the nutrition expert?” 

“Look out I” Yvonne said. 

Almost too late, Y saw the steel 
bar hurtling at him. He ducked, 
pushed Yvonne back into the pass- 
ageway and dropped flat, yanking his 
gun out. Steel rang on the flooring 
and sparks leaped. Above him, on 
the catwalk overlooking the large 
vat that fed nutrient to the crawler’s 
digestive apparatus, the slightly built 
man with the tight cap on the back 
of his head prepared to hurl an- 
other missile. 

“Stop!” Y called, but the walking 
corpse moved stiffly and * lifted a 
huge wrench. Y fired, knowing that 
otherwise the zombie would get the 
range with his second throw. He saw 
the bullet strike explosively, and the 
controlled body jerk as the slug tore 
its heart. 

Y got to his feet and started up 
the stairs to the catwalk. He could 
see the zombie sinking to the walk 
and he knew he would have to get 
there fast. He hoped he could make 
it in time. If what was under that 
cap got out — Y didn’t like to 
think about what might happen. 

He reached the head of the stairs, 
crouched and approached the dead 
man with his gun ready. The dead 
man did not stir. Y wouldn’t have 
been surprised if he had. 

Then he saw it — the small dark 
thing of many legs crawling from 
beneath the too-tight cap. He raised 
the gun» put his sight on it; he tried 
not to think. 

It moved, raising a claw and what 

85 











was undeniably a tool or weapon. 
The action, in a man, would have 
been both desperate and hostile. Y’s 
trigger finger tightened. 

His gun roared and echoed. When 
the bits of pulp had finished settling, 
he saw what he had done and very 
cautiously moved to the railing and 
vomited off from the walkway. 

IV 

T here were no more bandaged 
heads that the chief stoker and 
his assistant knew about. “Except. .” 
the chief stoker said, looking at 
Yvonne and speaking to Y and the 
newly arrived D O X and Philips, 
“possibly in the head where the en- 
tire crawler is controlled by the 
crawler captain and his first and 
second mates. The captain did sound 
kind of funny over the inter-segment 
phone, come to think of it. I can’t 
say there’s not Miffti in that com- 
partment.” 

“That’s where we go, then,” D O X 
said. 

“Whoa, D O X,” Y said, “what’s 
the plan? We can’t just go busting 
in there if there’s a Miffti in con- 
trol. No telling what would hap- 
pen.” 

“There’s just no telling, D O X 
said. “I was just looking out a win- 
dow and I’d swear we’ve left the 
main track and are charging deeper 
into unreclaimed territory.” 

“Think so?” Y asked. 

“I’m sure of it.”^ 

The stomach stoker went out the 
passageway. In a little bit he was 
back. “You’re right, D O X. We 
have changed course. There’s 
CATERP1LIAR EXPRESS 


nothing we can do about it, either, 
unless we can get at the head con- 
trols.” 

“We must,” Y said. “Come on!” 

•r 

O utside the head compartment the 
two smugglers and two spies 
conferred briefly and then hit the 
door. Things had become suddenly 
more urgent for them as the crawler 
had left the flat and begun ascend- 
ing SL hill. There was no certainty of 
what this portended other than some- 
thing other than human hands in 
control. 

The door burst open onto a death 
scene. Three men — the captain 
and his mates — lay sprawled on 
the floor. One mate had a hole in 
the back of his head the size of a 
large coin; the other two men had 
been killed with a weapon that 
burned holes through them not much 
thicker than an average gauge of 
wire; both the captain’s and first 
mate’s face were riddled with' it; in 
addition, the captain’s hands wereL 
riddled. It was easy to visualize the 
insect or insects trooping out of 
the second mate’s skull when he took 
a bandage off; the first mate and 
the captain approaching, horrified, 
the first mate succumbing to the at- 
tacks of a tiny weapon and the cap- 
tain vainly throwing his hands up. 

“God!” Philips said, and throwing 
up his hands pitched forward. Barn- 
ey dropped a second later. D O X 
let out a quick hiss and slapped a 
hand to the back of Y’s neck. Y 
ducked, saw the stain on D O X’s 
hand, realized that the Ameradian 
had just saved his life. He saw D O X 
turn, stamping, kicking, slapping with 

87 



his hands. In a moment Y was fol- 
lowing his lead. It was hard, exhaust- 
ing work killing these things the size 
of cockroaches. Now and then some- 
thing stung an arm or an ankle and 
without looking Y knew that the 
Miffti were scoring nonfatal shots. 
He hoped that they were nonfatal; 
that the flesh-destroying capacities of 
the minute weapons were as limit- 
ed as it now appeared. 

Y stopped hitting and stomping. 
There were no more Miffti in sight, 
but something else was. On the screen 
connected to the crawler’s eye he 
could see the alarming sight of an 
approaching cliff edge. The Miffti 
were driving the crawler up and 
over a precipice. 

The crawler had to be stopped. 

Y threw himself into the captain’s 
seat and grabbed at levers that were 
supposed to control this thing. None 
responded. 

The connections with the crawler’s 
brain had been severedi 

“Here, YI” D O X was down on 
his hands and knees, prying at the 
transparent partition that separated 
the cab from the pulsing crawler- 
brain. It came loose with a pop, 
and a Miffti came loose from a hold 
on one of the cables. It fell with a 
plop, rolled and shot a stream of 
light into D O X’s left eye. The mas- 
ter spy gave a groan, said, “Carry 
on, Y!” and slapped a big hand down 
with sickening effect. Y found him- 
self standing over a dead Ameradian 
and an open brain-conduct. 

‘Too bad,” Y said, “he was a good 
man. The best!” Then, turning swift- 
ly to the outside passageway he call- 
ed to the young stoker: “Come in 

88 


here! See if you can stop this thing!” 

T he stoker complied. His hands 
flew frantically as he spliced 
wires leading to brain connections 
and repaired a cable that led to pow- 
erful batteries. “I think I can do it. 
I think — ” he said. 

“You’d better hurry!” Y said, hold- 
ing his gun ready and watching the 
edge of the cliff coming closer and 
closer to them. Again he regretted his 
lack of expertise as a mechanic and 
electrician, bio or straight mechani- 
cal, Yet someone had to be on 
watch, he told himself. 

“There! Back of the furthest ca- 
ble. Yvonne said near his ear. “Oh, 
stop it, stop it quick!” 

Y aimed his gun but held his 
fire. What a bullet would do in the 
brain conduct he did not know, but 
he was reasonably sure that it would 
not be wise to find out. Besides, West 
America — Earth, he mentally cor- 
rected himself — needed a prisoner. 

The thing came out. Its forelegs 
were raised and it dropped some- 
thing the size of a sm^l pin that 
must have been its weapon. It came 
forward a few steps, its forelegs 
semaphoring in a way that was so 
human it should have been comical. 

Y hardly remembered afterward, 
but somehow he got Yvonne to stop 
screaming. Somehow he applied the 
palm of his hand to either cheek 
of her face in rapid succession in a 
manner that drew a disapproving 
glare from the stoker, then ordered 
her to get him a container suitable 
for a prisoner. Somehow he made her 
understand; somehow she went back 
into the abandoned passenger com- 

IF 



partment and returned with a box. 
It had been a face powder box and 
Y hoped briefly that there was noth- 
ing in the face powder to cause dis- 
tress to his prisoner. Then he remem- 
bered the dead and his own throb- 
bing ankles and decided comfort did 
not matter. He put the box down in 
the conduct, pointed at it and wait- 
ed. Now if the Miffti really were 
as intelligent as they seemed. ^ 

The Miffti got in the box. It 
bowed its head and clasped its tiny 
appendage over its head. In a crea- 
ture of such dimunitive size it was 
ridiculous; yet not ridiculous at all 
where human feelings are concerned. 
A wasp or a spider may arouse our 
most murderous instincts, but only 
while we are convinced of our own 
great superiority. Let the wasp and 
the spider show intelligence and dis- 
play fear for the awesome human 
creature and something strange hap- 
pens: the human can no longer think 
of the wasp or spider as merely an 
insect. 

Y moved two fingers to the box 
lid and cautiously picked it up. Even 
more cautiously he put the lid on. 
Moving on sheer will power, he 
picked the box up and placed it 
gently beside the control panel. 

“I think I’ve got it,” the stoker 
said. “Hit the button!” 

Y hit it, his heart all but stopped 
as he saw on the eye-screen that 
the crawler was poised right on the 
brink of a great precipice. The but- 
ton depressed, the body they were 


in shuddered along its great length, 
Y slammed a hand over the Miffti’s 
prison and held it closed even as he 
was thrown back several steps. 

They stopped. 

F or a number of seconds which 
stretched interminably no one 
moved or spoke. Finally Y found 
his voice and took command: 
“Streeter,” he said to the stoker, “do 
you think you can get this started 
and pilot us back to the station?” 
Streeter frowned. “I think so,” he 
said. Then he looked at Yvonne. 
“I’m sure I can, sir. But maybe not 
back to Cefus territory.” He frowned 
as he looked at the box Y held. “Per- 
haps it would be best to make for 
the nearest settlement.” 

“I agree,” Y said. “And that 
is — ?” 

“Detroit.” 

“Detroit!” The Bondman was 
momentarily incredulous, “But 
that’s — ” 

“Yes, sir. Ameradian. My father 
was an, uh, emigrant from there.” 
Yvonne looked at the stoker with 
something close to horror. Then she 
looked at the corpses lying about and 
her blue eyes glazed with a different 
kind of horror. This — this was more 
important. 

Y took stock of the situation. It 
looked, like it or not, as though there 
was going to have to be a united 
world. Pushing old prejudices aside, 
he slapped Streeter on the back. 
“Detroit it is — Earthman!” END

IF • Feature 


At Nycon ^ 3 

by LIN CARTER 

Our Man in Fandom gives us 
the on-fhe-scene report of 


the biggest 


So where were YOU over 
the Labor Day weekend? 

T his year, as you probably know, 
the 25th World Science Fiction 
Convention was held at New York’s 
Statler-Hilton hotel at Seventh Ave- 
nue and 33rd Street, right across the 
street from what used to be Penn 
Station and is now in the process of 
being transmogriffed into Madison 
Square Garden. The worldcon was 
under the joint chairmanship of Ted 
White and Dave Van Arnam and 
sponsored by New York’s liveliest 
fan club, the Fanoclasts. It was called 
“Nycon 3,” by the way, because two 
other world sf conventions have been 
previously held in this city, Nycon 
I, the first of all Worldcons, back in 
1939, and Nycon II (which was 


worldcon everl 


actually known as “the Newyorcon”) 
in 1956. 

You may never have attended one 
of the science-fiction world’s annual 
shindigs ... if so, here’s one fan’s 
casual description of the things that 
happened and the people he met and 
what they had to say. 

The biggest Worldcon yeti 

For me, the convention began 
about 6 o’clock Friday evening, Sep- 
tember 1st. I left the offices of the 
ad agency where I work, met my wife 
and went straight to the convention 
hotel. We came into the convention 
hall during the dinner break when 
there was a lull in the program. We 
wandered around for a bit meeting 
old friends and making a few new 
90 


/ 


ones, perhaps. We spoke to Gray and 
Betty Morrow, and Jim and Judy 
Blish came over to say hello while 
we were exploring the hucksters’ - 
tables off the central rotunda. 

Robert Silverberg was to auction 
Harlan Ellison to the high bidder. 
A young girl from somewhere around 
the Columbus, Ohio area bought him 
for $40. (This sum, I am told, went 
to TAFF — The Trans-Adantic Fan 
Fund, a worthy cause that tries to 
raise enough money each year to pay 
for a European fan’s trip over here 
to the Worldcon — or vice versa, 
in case the convention happens to 
be in Europe, as occasionally hap- 
pens.) Anyway, after this lucky girl 
bought Ellison, Silverberg then turn- 
ed around and prompdy auctioned 
her off. She went for $2.00 more 
than Harlan. I noticed Harlan escort- 
ing the young lady, Jan Trenholm, 
around during the entire convention. 

Nycon 3 was the most successful 
convention of all time, with the big- 
gest attendance in science-fiction his- 
tory — 1700 joined the con, and 
around 1500 actually turned up in 
person. This was a fantastic figure. 
Attendance at the annual sf World- 
con generally runs to just under five 
hundred, so in actual attendance fig- 
ures, this convention was three times 
the average size. In fact, it was half 
again bigger than the previous rec- 
ord-holder, the Chicago convention 
of 1952 to which 1,000 came. By 
comparison with this year’s Nycon, 
last year’s convention in Cleveland 
only drew about 850 attendees. 

Fans and pros came from all over. 

I talked with a genial fan named 
Waldemar Kumming from West 


Germany (Munich, I believe), and 
people came from Canada, Sweden 
and Great Britain, as well as from 
all over the United States. 

Celebrities Aplenty 

After the dinner break, the pro- 
gram resumed its first day. (Actually, 
the convention had been open the 
day before, Thursday, August 31st, 
at four p.m., but that was just to 
register any early arrivers. The pro- 
gram did not get started until eleven- 
thirty Friday morning.) The first 
thing on after dinner was the second 
“Galaxy of Fashion” show, a model- 
ling of futuristic famous sponsored 
by Galaxy magazine and directed by 
Dave Van Amam’s sweet and hard- 
working wife, Cindy. I grabbed a 
seat in the section reserved for press, 
photographers and, I guess, stray 
celebrities. Harry Harrison was on 
my right, and we tried to out-ogle 
each other as Fritz Leiber, who 
emceed the show, would announce 
each new model and she would then 
sashay out in glamorous and skimpy 
garments. En^h science-fiction nov- 
elist John Brunner sat in front of 
me and we chatted during the lull 
between models. Flashbulbs and 
movie cameras were zapping and 
whirring all about us, and I under- 
stand that some of the fashions pre- 
viewed on CBS Television earlier 
that day. In fact, I later caught a 
repeat of it on the Alan Burke 
show. 

After this, my wife' and I had din- 
ner with Donald WoUheim of Ace 
Books and his wife and teen-aged 
daughter Betsy. Robert A.W. Lown- 


AT NYCON #3 


91 



des who edits hardcovers for Avalon, 
paperbacks for Airmont, as well as 
a string of prozines, ate with us as 
did the popular sdence-fantasy nov- 
elist, Emil Petaja. Willy and Olga 
Ley were' at a nearby table. Since 
Emil Petaja was near me at my end 
of our table, we got to talking. I 
brought up the subject of his recent 
novels, such as The Star Mill, taken 
from Finnish mjrthology, and Lord 
of the Green Planety taken from 
the Irish legends. 1 suggested that 
when he has worked these sources 
dry, he turn to something equally 
exotic and virtually untouched, such 
as Russian mythology. We also dis- 
cussed our late mutual friend, the 
great fantasy artist Hannes Bok who 
died in his New York studio in April 
1964. 

After dinner, we weqt back to the 
convention hall and mingled with the 
swarms of people there. Michad 
Moorcock, author of the “Elric” 
stories and editor of England’s only 
surviving science-fiction magazine. 
New Worlds, was there. So were 
Keith Laumer and’* Leigh Brackett 
and Clifford D. Simak and John W. 
Campbell, Jr. Hal Clement came 
over to say hello — we hadn’t seen 
each other since the Lunacon some 
months before. 

The husksters’ tables were covered 
with books and paperbacks, sf maga- 
zines, and all sorts of other goodies 
like rare comic books, movie stills 
'and posters, big little books. Also a 
mint copy of H.P. Lovecraft’s The 
Outsider and Others, for sale to the 
highest bidder, and a drawing by 
Frank Frazetta. Browsing among the 
comicbookiana I ran into Otto Bin- 


der, a real oldtimer in science fic- 
tion writing who used to collaborate 
with his late brother Earl Binder un- 
der the name “Eando Binder” — 
Eando meaning “E and O.” Otto 
and I met a year or two ago when 
we were on a radio program to- 
gether. He used to write continuity 
for Captain Marvel, and for many 
years now, he’s been writing Super- 
man for the comics. 

In one of the rooms off the huck- 
sters’ hall, Bjo Trimble’s Internation- 
al Science Fantasy Art Show was in 
full swing. The Art Show has become 
a fixture at Worldcons by now — 
anybody can enter his work, fan or 
pro, and art of any kind is welcome, 
from pen and ink, watercolors or 
pastels to oil paintings, photographs, 
etc. There was a lot of Tolkien 
stuff in the show this year and a 
fascinating group of paintings based 
on Robert IB. Howard’s stories by 
artist Jeff Jones. Coming out of the 
show, a charming young woman and 
gifted writer whom I haven’t seen 
in many years came over to say 
hello — Katherine MacLean. And 
back in the rotunda just outside the 
convention hall I spoke to Fred Pohl, 
who was just back from a speaking 
tour of the the Deep South. Later 
in the week, Fred appeared on the 
Alan Burke show to comment on the 
clothes of the future fromi the Fash- 
ion Show. 

Invaders from Dionetics 

Saturday morning I got in early to 
attend the annual muster of the Hy- 
borian Legion, the fanclub devot^ 
to Robert E. Howard’s Conan stories 


92 


IF 



in particular and to sword & sorcery 
in general. 25 or 30 Legionnaires 
were there when I came in, including 
Hal Clement and Jack Williamson. 
L. Sprague de Camp was in mid- 
speech as I took my seat; he was 
telling about his work editing the new 
editions of the Conan books for Lan- 
cer’s paperback set. Then Fritz Lei- 
ber got up and spoke briefly about 
his Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser 
stories. The sword & sorcery news, 
speeches and all were nice, but what 
really made the muster for me was 
when George Scithers — the editor 
of Amra, the sword & sorcery fanzine 
— got up and proposed that Your 
Man In Fandom be elected by unani- 
mous acclaim to the honorary title 
of “Royal Necromancer of Aquilo- 
nia.” Makes a man feel quietly proud. 
Also makes a man wonder what hap- 
pened to ^ the Legion’s last Royal 
Necromancer .... 

Just before the muster broke up, 
a later-comer entered, pale and 
shaken, asking us if we knew that 
right outside the door some sort of 
World Dianetics congress was in full 
swing!?! “Like stepping into a weird 
and alien world, it was,” he shudder- 
ed. We stepped out among the Dia- 
netics people, and by Crom, he was 
right! A very alien world. We looked 
at them, and they looked at us. We 
Robert E. Howard fans thought they 
were a bunch of kooks, and they L. 
Ron Hubbard fans were doubtless 
entertaining the same opinion of us. 

Sprague had invited Jack William- 
son, Fritz Leiber, George Scithers 
and me up to his room for a drink. 
Over Sprague’s scotch we talked 
about the brand-new Conan yams 


Sprague and I are now writing, then 
adjourned to the coffee shop for a 
late breakfast together. I really dug 
the chance to meet Jack Williamson, 
who has been one of my favorite ad- 
venture writers, for years, and having 
heard he would be there, I brought 
along copies of Darker Than You 
Think and Legion of Time for him to 
autograph for me. 

A MeeMhe-Pros Party 

That evening, Larry and Noreen 
Shaw threw a mammoth get-together 
party in their suite, and the drinks 
were on Lancer Books for whom 
Larry is editor. There was quite a 
crush of people. 1 saw Isaac and 
Gertrude Asimov but couldn’t get 
close enough to them to say hello. 
Terry Carr was talking to Roger 
Zelazny, and my wife and I man- 
aged to squeeze into a comer by the 
window with Sprague and his 
charming blonde wife, Catherine. We 
sat near Dick and Pat Lupoff. Dick 
kept sneaking off somewhere and re- 
appearing with bottles of chilled 
champagne which we shared. Dick’s 
first novel, One Million Centuries, 
was just published by Lancer, so we 
toasted it. While Sprague and I took 
the opportunity to thrash out a few 
plot-problems on our new Conan 
yams, another old-time favorite 
writer of mine came squeezing 
through the crush — George O. 
Smith. Spotting me, he grabbed my 
head and turned it to several differ- 
ent angles, exclaiming, “By golly, if 
you don’t remind me of a young 
Fletcher Pratt!” 

With unusual presence of mind, I

I didn’t want to get here except in 
so far as I wanted to be anywhere 
but where I was. This isn’t where I 
was, but it isn’t anywhere, either. 
Anywhere is fuzzy gray; not an opti- 
cal gray but a mental gray. The gray 
in the direction that you’re not look- 
ing. For you insects, it’s the gray be- 
hind your head. For me, it’s the gray 
directly over my head. To each his 
own, as one of your songs says. 

Anywhere is an all-around term — 
like anything. Just try and visualize 
an anything. It has no form; but it 
isn’t formless, because formlessness 
is a specific characteristic, rather than 
a general one. You might say that 


anything is formless. Yes, you might. 

In fact, any characteristic that you 
can name is a specific one and is 
necessarily inapplicable to anything. 
Therefore, anything has no character- 
istics. Since nothing likewise has no 
characteristics, anything is the same 
thing as nothing. ... 

Dammit, I told you to just have 
one person talk to me. When all of 
you midgets start yeUing at once, 
all I get is a gabble. 

Oh, you think that what I’ve been 
saying is nonsense, eh? Well, shrimp, 
that nonsense took us hundreds of 
generations to develop. If you can’t 
see it, it’s your problem. You insects 


95 


are the ones who are in danger, not 
me. If you want to survive, you’ll 
have to master any-valued logic and 
mathematics and drop the infantile 
nonsense that you’ve concocted — 
like that bunk about dialectics that 
so many of you think so much about. 

Damn, damn, damn I Sweden is 
the only one who’s supposed to be 
talking. Everybody else get off the 
air. If you insects don’t, stop trying 
to all talk at once. I’ll knock out your 
communications for another twenty- 
four hours. 

G etting back to my “nonsense,” 
may I point out that even your 
rudimentary physique has reached the 
point where you know that the uni- 
verse curves back on itself. Left to 
yourselves, you would probably have 
discovered that all phenomena in 
your universe are circular. Extreme 
opposites are identities. 

Yes, Sweden, I guess I did mean 
physics instead of physique. English 
is very confusing with all those dif- 
ferent symbols that sound alike. 

Yes, I am way off the track. I 
haven’t communicated with any other 
individuals for almost a hundred gen- 
erations. Also, I had to learn your 
languages from watching — well, 
that’s not quite the right word — 
perceiving your television broadcasts. 
And before I could do that, I had 
to crack the scanning code that you 
use. Besides, it isn’t easy to hang onto 
a train of thought when you keep in- 
terrupting me. 

I’ll postpone the any-valued math- 
ematics until I finish telling you why 
you are in danger. The only way 


An IF First Story 

In each issue of If we bring you a 
story by a brand-new writer, never be- 
fore published. This month's is by Hank 
Davis, a 23-year-old senior at the Uni- 
versity of Kentucky. Math major, singer in 
the University's Men's Glee Club, mem- 
ber of the Young Americans for Free- 
dom, Davis read A. E. Van Vogt's Sian 
while he was in the second grade, got 
hooked and has never succeeded in un-- 
hooking himself. Davis defines his political 
status as "pragmatic anarchist" and lists 
as his twin heroes Dave Brubeck and Ber- 
ry Goldwater. 


to get you insects to do anything is 
to scare you. 

As I was saying, I didn’t intend 
to come here. Any old port in a 
storm, as you insects say, and there 
was a storm — a rather large one 
from my viewpoint, since it involved 
the eradication of yours truly. So 
I took a dust — or is that a powder? 

I don’t think that you can under- 
stand my crime. Too alien to your 
basic cultural matrix. It was very 
trivial. Rather like walking on the 
grass or keeping a library book over- 
due. For such trivial offenses, j^ou 
have trivial penalties. Our system was 
much simpler. Every offense carried 
the death penalty. 

This was cruel, but not unneces- 
sarily so. There is a constant quantity 
of cruelty in the universe, and if it is 
put off at one time, circumstances 
will dictate that it be applied later. 
For generations, we hadn’t applied 
such cruel measures as compulsory 
birth control or elimination of the 
unfit young so that there would be 


96 


IP 




room for the fit. We finally ran afoul 
of the law of conservation of cruelty 
and had to start stringing up the 
walkers-on-grass by their necks or 
be elbowed to death by each other. 

I speak figuratively. We have 
neither necks nor elbows. 

1 recognized the necessity for this 
in general, but still didn’t care for 
the idea of it being applied to me 
specifically, so I grabbed one of our 
ships and left. 

This fleeing from punishment was 
fully in line with our ethical sys- 
tem, incidentally. Since extreme op- 
posites are identities, the small is 
equivalent to the very large. Hence, 
the destruction of an individual is 
equivalent to the destruction of the 
universe — which is also the way that 
the individual’s destruction appears 
from his viewpoint. Since the elimi- 
nation of the universe is an obvious 
evil, every individual must survive 
at all cost. Not that this would have 
made any difference to the police 
who were out to get me, but, if I 
had been caught, there would have 
been no nonsense about “resisting 
arrest” — which would have been 
rather silly anyway, since I could only 
be executed once. 

We could go anywhere in no time 
by means of our Anywhere Drive 
ships. I can’t explain it to you until 
I’ve taught any-valued mathematics 
to you, but I can play word games 
so that you’ll think you understand. 
By generating an Anywhere field, 
the illusory condition that the ship is 
at a specific somewhere in space is 
canceled, and the ship is anywhere 
— or nowhere; or everjrwhere, it’s 
the same thing — in the universe. 
SQUAHER^S RIGHTS 


The universe curves back on itself, 
and its size is determined by the 
quantity of mass contained witliin it. 
We generate a — call it a capsule of 
curved space, but that’s a lousy 
description — which fools the ship 
into thinking that the universe is no 
larger than the ship. Since the ship 
doesn’t want to leave the universe — 
can’t leave the universe, it stays put. 
We can shove the capsule of curved 
space anywhere in the universe at an 
infinite velocity, since it doesn’t have 
mass. When the capsule moves, the 
ship follows, and finite distances are 
covered in zero time. 

Right you are. 1 am talking non- 
sense, but it’s as close to reality as 
1 can get until 1 teach any-valued 
math to you, so shut up and learn. 
It’s your funeral, not mine, as you 
insects like to say. 

T he trouble with my getaway was 
that anything I could do, the 
fuzz could also do. I could go any- 
where in the universe, but so could 
they. My only chance was to lose 
myself. The universe is so big that 
all the stars in it could bum out be- 
fore a random search found me. Un- 
fortunately, the ship’s navigation 
mechanism was rigged to prevent just 
such contingencies as lawbreakers’ 
escaping. It automatically transmitted 
the destination of the ship to police 
headquarters before departure. 

With the cops closing in, it was 
sink or swim, as you insects like to 
say, so I disconnected the navigation 
mechanism and said ready or not, 
here I come, and went. 

Naturally I didn’t know where I 
was when I arrived, but neither did 

97 



John Law. Where I was turned out 
to be here. Wherever that is. So I 
settled down on Earth, as you in- 
sects later named it. Not Imowing 
where I was, I could never return 
home anyway. 

If you don’t like my vocabulary, 
don’t blame me. It’s derived from 
your TV and radio programs. Blame 
them! And shut up so that I can 
finish! 

The earth was a lot hotter when 
I arrived than it is now, but I cooled 
it down in a hurry. We get our 
energy by absorbing heat from our 
surroundings, instead of oxidizing 
matter like you do. As long as I’m 
not damaged — and it would take a 
lot to damage me — I don’t have to 
take in any solid matter. 

Your astronomers have noticed — 
huh? Oh? What’s the second law of 
thermodynamics? 

You’re putting me on. That’s just a 
condition that holds as long as en- 
tropy is increasing. As soon as you’ve 
digested any-valued mathematics, 
you’ll be able to see how it’s possible. 

As I was saying, you are aware that 
Venus is much hotter than the Earth. 
The reason for this is me. Or, rather, 
it isn’t me. Venus doesn’t have me to 
cool it off, like Earth does. Matter 
of fact, if I weren’t here. Earth 
would heat up considerably, due to 
heat from the core which I absorb. 

I’ve overdone it a few times. Ice 
ages, you know. 

Yes, I’ve been here for a long time. 
I’m very long lived compared to 
you. I’m much bigger than you, also. 
I wasn’t even aware of your existence 
until you started broadcasting. I’m 
sensitive to the entire electromagnetic 

98 


spectrum, instead of the narrow strip 
that you can see or feel. 

Where am I hiding? I’m not hiding! 
You’ve known where I am for years. 
You’ve named me Antarctica. I 
thought that you would have guessed 
that by now. Since I absorb heat, 
I’m covered with ice, although ab- 
sorption from the air is accidental. 
I get most of my heat from my plan- 
et’s core. 

Yes, my planet. After all, I was 
here before any of you were. What’s 
more, you wouldn’t have been here 
if I hadn’t cooled the planet down 
so fast. 

No, this isn’t a hoax. Want me to 
drown out all your communications 
again? 

You asked for it. 

Anybody out there? Well, hello 
there again. It was rather silly 
of you to shoot those missiles at me. 
A fission reaction produces heat, 
mostly, so I just absorbed it. 

No, I’m not mad. You don’t get 
mad at viruses, do you? Now be 
quiet and let me pick up where I 
left off. 

I’ve gotten in touch with you 
humans because you’re going to have 
to leave. All of you. 

Yes, I mean leave Earth. Where 
do you think I meant? 

After I give you any-valued math- 
ematics, you can build ships with 
Anywhere drives and find some other 
planet suitable for you. You’ll have 
to have the drive because none of the 
other planets in the solar system be- 
sides this one are suitable for you; 
and soon this one won’t be suitable 
for you. 


IF 



Well, you see, Tm pregnant. 

I think that’s the right word. 1 
don’t know mticli about how you 
humans reproduce since you never 
have much about it on your broad- 
casts. 

Anyway, I’ll have to reproduce 
soon. We reproduce by dividing in 
two at regular intervals. Each new 
individual has /the memories of the 
old one, but never mind that. It’s in- 
voluntary, but we have drugs which 
can prevent it. I took all that I had 
when I came, but they’ve worn off 
now. 

In about twenty years. I’ll be- 
come very hungry for solid matter 
and I’ll have to start absorbing ma- 
terial from the crust of the earth 
imtil I’ve doubled in size. 

The trouble is that the shift in 
weight will cause earthquakes and 
volcanic eruptions everywhere on the 
earth. It may even, cause the axis to 
shift, and that would really be messy. 


I would leave in my ship, but that 
would be just as bad. I can’t get to 
the ship — or the Moon, as you 
call it — and if it comes to me, the 
tidal effects could tear the Earth to 
pieces. 

Get the picture? Whether I stay 
or go, the planet gets wrecked. The 
only way out is for you to build 
ships with Anywhere drives and pull 
up stakes. 

Yes, I could tell you how to con- 
coct the drug, but I’m too far along 
for that to help. I have been for 
about three hundred years. 

You’re awfully quiet out there. 
You haven’t fainted, have you? 

Are you recording this? Good. I’ll 
give you the mathematics now. Sor- 
ry about r unnin g you off the planet, 
but you would have done it your- 
selves in a couple of centuries, since 
you obviously weren’t going to limit 
your population. And, anyway, I was 
here first. END

He was as good as invisible — 
which was useful, considering 
how many people wanted his life! 


WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 


M ount Lookitthat the planet is a 
Venus-sized world circling Tau 
Ceti, Its only habitable area is a not 
particularly flat Plateau half the size 
of California, set on top of Mount 
Lookitthat the mountain, forty miles 
above the heUish heat and pressure 
at the planefs true surface. 


For three hundred years the 
colony on Mount Lookitthat has been 
a two-class system, dominated by the 
**crew,** with the **colonists^* under- 
neath. The heart of the colony is the 
Hospital, an amorphous structure 
which incorporates the two slowboats 
that once carried men to the planet. 


•> 


Li 


t 


101 


One function of the Hospital is Im- 
plementation, the army and police of 
Mount Lookitthat, led by JESUS 
PIETRO CASTRO as Head. CAS- 
TRO, who is half colonist, is super- 
vised by MILLARD PARLETTE, 
nearly two hundred years old and 
pure crew. 

Another function of the Hospital 
is the organ banks. Colonists accused 
of crimes go into the organ banks, 
which are used to cure the sick. Main- 
ly they benefit the crew. Most medi- 
cine on Mount Lookitthat involves 
the organ banks. 

So things stand when Ramrobot 
#143 leaves Earth . and when 
it arrives, twelve years later. 

The ramrobots come only when 
Earth*s latest discovery is such that 
it cannot be sent as information in a 
laser beam. This holds in particular 
for items of biological engineering, 
of which Mount Lookitthat has 
many: indoor grass, housecleaners, 
architectural coral, altered citrus 
groves, and so forth. 

The SONS of EARTH, a crewish 
rebel organization, correctly suspect 
that Ramrobot #143 is something 
special; though only MILLARD 
PARLETTE knows its full impor- 
tance. Their attempt to capture it is 
foiled by CASTRO, but POLLY 
TOURNQUIST gets pictures. She 
plans to show them at the rebel 
meeting the next night. Cover for the 
meeting is a party at the house of 
HARRY KANE, leader of the rebels. 

Through a chance meeting with 
JAY HAWK HOOD, MATTHEW 
LEIGH KELLER is invited to the 
party. MATT KELLER is a keeper 
of mining worms, unrelated to the 


rebels, but he also has a special form 
of luck such that people generally 
ignore him when he wants them 
He believes his uncle went to the 
organ banks for treason. 

He shortly realizes that the party 
must be a cover for the Sons of 
Earth, with people like himself in- 
vited for camouflage. It doesn't 
bother him. But his later pass at 
POLLY TOURNQUIST is refused, 
and this, for obscure reasons, plunges 
him into a black depression. He be- 
gins drinking. 

Drunk and feeling sorry for him- 
self, he tries to explain to LANEY 
MATTSON : at a certain point, 
women forget him completely. In 
kindness she seduces him. They are 
in a dark bedroom when Imeplemen- 
tation raids the house. 

The rebel group is broken. Most 
of the Sons of Earth are removed 
to the Hospital. MATT escapes, 
lucky as usual. 

In the morning he returns to the 
wrecked house. Searching for food 
and clothing, he finds a car buried 
in the basement. His fiddling around 
blows the roof off, leaving clear sky 
above the car. 

Two cliffs, with guarded bridges, 
stand between MATT and the Hos- 
pital. He'd never make it without a 
car. He considers the car an omen. 
But he has never flown a car. 

Determined to make the best try 
he can to rescue Laney and the oth- 
ers, he tries it anyway. 

Results are predictably spectacular; 
but he doesn't fall. After an un- 
avoidable detour into the mist below 
the Plateau's void edge, MA TT winds 
up on Alpha Plateau . the crew 



plateau, the site of the Hospital. 
Hours later, after nightfatt, he tries 
to get in. 

The wall guard spots him almost 
instantly. But when he surrenders, 
stands up in a blaze of spotUghts 
with his hands in the air, he is ignored 
and forgotten. Totally confused, he 
walks away. 

Still confused, on the safe side of 
a hUl, he tries to think it out. He 
might as well try again, because he 
can*t leave; he*s lost the car, and there 
are the two guarded bridges. His de^ 
cisions if darkness doesn*t hide him, 
but splotlights do, then he should be 
safe walking up the middle of a light- 
ed road. 

It works, up to the point where he 
has to pound on the gate with a rock 
to get in. The gate guard taKts him 
in at gunpoint. 

Once inside the HospitaVs huge 
tnain doors, the gate guard tells him 
how wrong he's been. They are go- 
ing to the vivarium, where MATT 
will be put to sleep with the other 
Sons of Earth, He will not wake. 
When the time comes, he will be 
taken apart for the organ banks, still 
asleep, 

MATT turns, horrified. For a mo- 
ment the guard, HOBART, seems 
ready to shoot. Then he goes mad. 
He runs off crying, **Mist Demons! 
Vm supposed to be on the gate!" 

XI 

A t one-thirty another officer came 
to relieve Polly’s guard. 

The newcomer’s uniform was not 
as well pressed, but he himself seem- 
ed in better condition. His muscles 


were gymnasium muscles, and he was 
casually alert at one-thirty in the 
morning. He waited until the long- 
headed man had gone, then moved 
to inspect the dials along the edge of 
Poll/s coffin. 

He was more thorough than the 
other. He moved methodically down 
the line» in no hurry, jotting the 
settings in a notebook. Then he open- 
ed two big clamps at two corners of 
the coffin and swung the lid back, 
careful not to jar it. 

The figure within did not move. 
She was wrapped like a mummy, a 
mummy with a snout, in soft, swad- 
dling cloth. The snout was a bulge 
over her mouth and nose, the mouth 
pads and the arrangements for breath- 
ing. There were similar protrusions 
over her ears. Her arms were crossed 
at her waist, straight-jacket fashion. 

The Implementation officer looked 
down at her for long moments. When 
he turned, he showed his first signs 
of furtiveness. But he was alone, and 
no footsteps sounded in the haU. 

From the head end of the coffin 
protruded a padded tube with a cap 
even more heavily padded in sponge 
rubber. The officer opened the cap 
and spoke softly. 

“Don’t be afraid. I’m a friend. 
I’m going to put you to sleep.’’ 

He peeled the soft bandage from 
Polly’s arm, drew his gun and fired 
at the skin. Half a dozen red beads 
formed there, but the girl did not 
move. He could not have been sure 
that she heard him, or that she felt 
the needles. 

He closed the lid and the cap of 
the speaking tube. 

He was perspiring freely as he 


SLOWBOAT CARGO 


103 



watched the dials change. Presently 
he produced a screwdriver and went 
to work at the backs of the dials. 
When he finished, all eight dials 
read as they had read when he came 
in. 

They lied. They said that Polly 
Tournquist was awake but motionless, 
conscious but deprived of any sensory 
stimulus. They said she was going 
mad by increments. Whereas Polly 
Tournquist was asleep. She would be 
asleep for the eiglit hours of Loren’s 
tour of duty. 

Loren wiped his face and sat 
down. He did not enjoy taking such 
risks, but it was necessary. The girl 
must know something; else she 
wouldn’t be here. Now she could 
hold out for eight hours longer. 

T he man they wheeled into the or- 
gan bank operating room was 
unconscious. He was the same man 
Jesus Pietro’s squad had found rest- 
ing on the dead man switch, one of 
those he had questioned that after- 
noon. Jesus Pietro was through with 
him; he had been tried and con- 
demned, but in law he was still alive. 
It was a legal point, nothing more. 

The operating room was big and 
busy. Against one long wall were 
twenty small suspended-animation 
tanks mounted on wheels, for moving 
medical supplies to and from the 
room next door. Doctors and internes 
worked quietly and skillfully at a 
multitude of operating tables. There 
were cold baths: open tanks of fluid 
kept at a constant 10° Fahrenheit. 
Beside the door was a twenty-gallon 
tank half full of a straw-colored fluid. 
Two internes wheeled the convict 

104 

i 


into the operating room, and one 
immediately injected a full pint of 
the straw-colored fluid into his arm. 
They moved the table next to One 
of the cold baths. A woman moved 
over to help, carefully fastened a 
breathing mask over the man’s face. 
The internes tilted the table. The 
convict slid into the bath without a 
splash. 

“That’s the last,” said one. “Oh, 
boy. I’m beat.” 

The woman looked at him with 
concern, a concern which might have 
showed in her mouth behind the mask 
but which could not show in her eyes. 
Eyes have no expression. The in- 
terne’s voice had shown almost total 
exhaustion. ‘Take off, the both of 
you,” she said. “Sleep late tomorrow. 
We won’t need you,” 

When they finished with this con- 
vict, the organ banks would be full. 
In law he was . still alive. But his 
body temperature fell fast, and his 
heartbeat was slowing. Eventually it 
stopped. The patient’s temperature 
continued to fall. In two hours it was 
well below freezing, yet the straw- 
colored fluid in his veins kept any 
part of him from freezing. 

In law he was still alive. Prisoners 
had been reprieved at this point and 
revived without medical ill effects, 
though they walked in terror for the 
rest of their days. 

Now they lifted the convict onto 
an operating table. His skull was 
opened; an incision was made in bis 
neck, cutting the spinal cord just 
below the brain stem. The brain was 
lifted out, carefully, for the mem- 
branes surrounding it must not be 
damaged. Though the doctors might 

IF 



deny it, there was a kind of leva- 
ence attached to the human brain, 
and to this moment At this moment 


the convict became legally dead* 

In a New YoA hoqdtal a caidiec- 
tomy would have b^ performed 
first, and the prisoner would have 
been dead when it was over. On We 
Made It he would have been dead the 
moment his body temperature reach- 
ed 32° F. It was a legal point You 
had to draw the line somewhere. 

They flash-burned his brain and 
saved the ashes for um burial. His 
skin came next, removed in one 
piece, stUl living. Machines did most 
of the work, but the machines of the 
Plateau were not advanced enough 
to work without human control. The 
doctors proceeded as if they were dis- 
assembling a delicate, very valuable, 
vastly complex jigsaw pu^e. Each 
unit went into a suspended-animation 
tank. Someone then took a tiny sam- 
ple with a hypodermic and tested it 
for a wide variety of rejection re- 
actions. A transplant operation was 
never cut-and-dried. A patient’s body 
would reject foreign parts unless each 
rejection was balanced by complex 
biochemicals. When the tests were 
over each unit was labeled in full de- 
tail and wheeled next door, into the 
organ banks. 


M att was lost. He wandered 
through the halls looking for a 
door labeled “Vivarium.” Some of 
the doors he passed had labels; some 
did not. The Hospital was huge. 
Chances were he could wander for 
days without finding the vivarium 
the gateman had mentioned. 

Solitary individuals passed him in 


the corridors, in police uniforms or in 
white gowns and white masks pulled 
down around their necks. If he saw 
someone coming Matt shrank against 
the wall and remained perfectly stUl 
until the intruder passed. Nobody 
noticed him. His strange invisibility 
protected him well. 

But he wasn’t getting anywhere. 

A map, that’s what he needed. 

Some of these doors must lead to 
offices. Some or all offices must 
have maps in them, perhaps built into 
wall or desk. After all, the place was 
so complicated .... Matt nodded to 
himself. Here was a door now, with 
a strange symbol and some letter- 
ing: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL 
ONLY. Maybe .... 

He opened the door. And froze 
halfway through it. 

Glass tanks filled the room like 
floor-to-ceiling aquarium tanks, each 
subdivided into compartments. They 
were arranged like a labyrinth, or like 
the bookcases in a public library. In 
the first moments Matt couldn’t 
recognize anything he saw in those 
tanks; but in their asymmetrical 
shapes and in their infinite dark 
shades^ of red, their nature was un- 
mistakable. 

He stepped all the way inside. He 
had abandoned control of his legs, 
and they moved of themselves. 
These flattish dark red objects, those 
translucent membranes, the soft 
looking blobs of alien shapes, the 
great transparent cylindrical tanks 
filled with bright red fluid . 
Yes, these had been human beings. 
And there were epitaphs: 

Type AB, RhH-. Glucose con- 
tent . Rd Corp count

lift humerus, live. Marrow type 
O, Rh-, N, 02. Length .... IM- 
PORTANT: test for fit in sockets 
before using. 

Matt closed his eyes and rested 
his head against one of the tanks. The 
glass surface was cold. It felt good 
against his perspiring forehead. He 
bad always had too much empathy. 
Now there was a grief in him, and 
he needed time to mourn these stran- 
gers. Mist Demons grant they were 
strangers. 

Pancreas. Rejection classes F, 4, pr, 
2 1 . DIABETIC TENDENCIES :

only. DO NOT TRANSPLANT. 

A door opened. 

M att slid behind the tank and 
watched from around the cor- 
ner. The woman wore gown and 
mask, and she pushed something on 
wheels. Matt watched her transfer 
things from the cart into various of 
the larger tanks. 

Somebody had just died. 

And the woman in the mask was a 
monster. If she’d taken off her mask 
to reveal foot-long poison-dripping 
fangs, Matt couldn’t have feared her 
more. 

Voices came through the door. 
“We can’t use any more muscle 
tissue.” A woman’s voice, high and 
querulous, with a crew lilt. The hit 
didn’t quite ring true, though Matt 
couldn’t have said where it failed. 

A sarcastic man’s voice answered. 
“What shall we do, throw it away?” 
“Why not?” 


Seconds of silence. The woman 
with the cart finished her work and 
moved toward the door. Then: ‘Tve 
never liked the idea. A man died to 
give us healthy, hving tissue, and 
you want to throw it away like — ” 
The closing door cut him off rather 
abruptly. 

Like the remnants of a ghouTs 
feast, Matt finished for him. 

He was turning toward the hall 
door when his eye caught something 
else. Four of the tanks were differ- 
ent from the others. They sat near 
the hall door, on flooring whose scars 
showed where there had once been 
suspended-animation tanks; these did 
not have heavy, machinery-filled 
bases. Instead, machinery rested in 
the tanks themselves, behind the 
transparent walls. It might have been 
aerating machinery. The nearest tank 
contained six small human hearts. 

Unmistakably they were hearts. 
They beat. But they were tiny, no 
bigger than a child’s fist. Matt 
touched the surface of the tank, and 
it was blood warm. The tank next 
to it held three-lobed objects which 
had to be livers; but they were 
small, small. 

That did it. In wjiat seemed one 
leap. Matt was out in the hall. He 
leaned against the wall, gasping, his 
shoulders heaving, his eyes unable to 
see anything but those clusters of 
small hearts and livers. 

Someone rounded the corner and 
came to an abrupt stop. 

Matt turned and saw him, a big 
soft man in an Implementation police 
uniform. Matt tried his voice. It 
came out blurred but comprehensi- 
ble: “Where’s the vivarium?”

IP 



The man stared, then pointed, 
^ake a right and you'll find a flight 
of stairs. Up one flight, take a right, 
then a left, and watch for the sign. 
It’s a big door with an alarm light, 
you can’t miss it.” 

^Thanks.” Matt turned toward the 
stairs. His stomach hurt, and there 
was a shivering in his hands. He’d 
have liked to drop where he was, 
but he had to keep going. 

Something stung his ^ arm. 

Matt turned and raised his arm 
in the same instant. Already the 
sting was gone; his arm was as numb 
as a haunch of meat. Half a dozen 
tiny red drops bedewed his wrist. 

The big, soft man regarded Matt 
with a puzzled frown. His gun was 
in his hand. 

The galaxy spun madly, receding. 

C orporal Halley Fox watched the 
colonist fall, then bolstered his 
gun. What was the world coming to? 
First the ridiculous secrecy about the 
ramrobot. Then, two hundred prison- 
ers swept up in one night, and the 
whole Hospital going crazy trying to 
cope. And now! A colonist wander- 
ing the Hospital corridors, actually 
asking for the Vivarium! 

Well, he’d get it. Halley Fox lifted 
the man and slung him over his 
shoulder, grunting with the effort. 
Only his face was soft. Report it and 
forget it. He shifted his burden and 
staggered toward the stairs. 

XII 

A t dawn the graded peak of Mount 
Lookitthat swam beneath a sea 
of fog. For those few who were al- 

SLOWBOAT CARGO 


ready aboard, the sky merely turned 
from black to gray. This was not the 
poison mist below the void edge, bnt 
a continuous cloud of water vapor» 
thick enough to let a blind man win 
a shooting match. Crew and colon- 
ists, one and all, as they stepped 
outside their homes their homes van- 
ished behind them. They walked and 
worked in a universe ten yards in 
diameter. 

At seven o’clock Implementation 
police moved into the trapped forest, 
a squad at each end. Yellow fog 
lights swept the tongue of forest from 
the nearest sections of wall. The light 
barely reached the trees. Since the 
men who had been on watch that 
night had gone home, the searchers 
had no idea what animal they were 
searching for. Some thought it must 
be colonists. 

At nine they met in the middle, 
shrugged at each other and left. 
Nothing human or animal lived in 
the trapped woods, nothing bigger 
than a big insect. Four aircars never- 
theless rose into the fog and sprayed 
the wood from end to end. 

At nine-thirty .... 

Jesus Pietro cut the grapefruit in 
half and held one half upside down. 
The grapefruit meat dropped in sec- 
tions into his bowl. He asked, “Did 
they ever find that rabbit?” 

Major Jansen stopped with his first 
sip of coffee halfway to his lips. “No, 
sir, but they did find a prisoner.” 

“In the woods?” 

“No, sir. He was pounding on the 
gate with a rock. The gateman took 
him inside the Hospital, but from 
there it becomes a little unclear — ** 

“Jansen, it’s already nuclear. What 

lor 



was this man doing pounding on 
the gate?'* A horrible thought struck 
him. “Was he a crew?” 

“No, sir. He was Matthrew Keller. 
Positive identification.” 

Grapefruit juice spilled on the 
breakfast rack. “Keller?” 

‘The same.” 

“Then who was in the car?” 

“1 doubt we’ll ever know» sir. Shall 
1 ask for volunteers to examine the 

body?” 

Jesus Pietro lauded long and loud. 
Jansen was pure colonist, though he 
and his ancestors had be^ in service 
so long that their accents and man- 
ners were almost pure crew. It would 
never do for him to joke with his 
superiors in public. But in private he 
could be amusing • . and he had 
the sense to know the difference. 

“I’ve been trying to think of a 
way to shake up Implementation,” 
said Jesus Pietro. “That might do it. 
Well. Keller came up to the gate and 
began pounding on it with a rock?” 
“Yes, sir. The gateman took him 
in charge after calling Watts. Watts 
waited half an hour before he called 
the gatehouse again. The gateman 
couldn’t remember what happened 
after he and the prisoner reached 
the Hopsital. He was back on duty, 
and he couldn’t explain that either. 
He should have reported to Watts, of 
course. Watts put him under arrest.” 
“Watts shouldn’t have waited half 
an hour. Where was Keller all this 
time?” 

“A Corporal Fox found him out- 
side the door to the organ banks, 
shot him and carted him off to the 
vivarium.” 

“Then he and the gateman are 
108 


both waiting for us. Good. I’ll never 
sleep again until 1 get this straightened 
out” Jesus Pietro finished his break- 
fast in a remarkable hurry. 

Then it occurred to him that the 
mystery was deeper than that How 
had Keller reached Alpha Plateau at 
all? The guards wouldn’t have let 
him past the bridge. 

By car? But the only car 
involved — 

H obart was scared. He was as 
frightened as any suspect Jesus 
Pietro had seen, and he took no in- 
terest in hiding it. “I don’t know! I 
took him through the door, the big 
door. 1 made him walk ahead so he 
couldn’t jump me — ” 

“And did he?” 

“I can’t remember anything like 
that.” 

“A bump on the head might have 
given you amnesia. Sit still. Jesus 
Pietro walked around the chair to 
examine Hobart’s scalp. His imperson- 
al gentleness was frightening in itself. 
“No bumps, no bruises. Does your 
head hurt?” 

“I feel fine.” 

“Now, you walked in the door. 
Were you talking to him?” 

The man bobbed his graying head. 
“Uh-huh. I wanted to know what 
he was doing banging on the gate. 
He wouldn’t say.” 

“And then?” 

“All of a sudden I — ” Hobart 
stopped, swallowed convulsively. 

Jesus Pietro put an edge in his 
voice. “Go on.” 

Hobart started to cry. 

“Stop that. You started to say 
something. What was it?” 

IF 



“All of a sudden I — gulp — 
remembered I was s’posed fbe at the 
gate” 

“But what about Keller?” 

“Who?” 

“What about your prisoner?” 

“I can’t rememberl” 

“Oh, get out of here.” Jesus Pietro 
thumb^ a button. 'Take him back 
to the vivarium. Get me Keller.” 

U p a flight of stairs, take a right, 
then a left — 

VIVARIUM 

Behind the big door were rows of 
contour couches, skimpily padded. 
All but two couches had occupants. 
There were ninety-eight prisoners 
here, of all ages from fifteen to fifty- 
eight, and all were asleep. Each was 
wearing a headset. They slept quietly, 
more than the usual sleeper, breathing 
shallowly, their peaceful expressions 
untroubled by bad dreams. It was a 
strangely restful place. They slept in 
rows of ten, some snoring gently, the 
rest silent. 

Even the guard looked sleepy. He 
sat in a more conventional chair to 
one side of the door, with his double 
chin drooping on his chest, with his 
arms folded in his lap. 

More than four centuries ago, at 
some time near the middle of the 
nineteen hundreds, a group of Russian 
scientists came up with a gadget that 
might have made sleep obsolete. In 
some places, it did. By the twenty- 
fourth century it was a rare comer 
of the known universe that did not 
know of the sleepmaker. 

Take three electrodes, light elec- 


trodes. Now pick a guinea pig, hu- 
man, and get him to lie down with 
his eyes closed. Put two electrodes on 
his eyelids and tape the third to the 
nape of his neck. Run a gentle, 
rhythmic electric current from eye- 
lids to nape, through the brain. Your 
guinea pig will drop off immediately. 
Turn the current off in a couple of 
hours, and he will have had the equi- 
valent of eight-hours sleep. 

You’d rather not furn off the 
current? Fine. It won’t hurt him. He’ll 
just go on sleeping. He’ll sleep through 
a hurricane. You’ll have to wake 
him occasionally to eat, drink, evacu- 
ate, exercise. If you don’t plan to 
keep him long you can skip the exer- 
cise. 

Suspects weren’t kept long in the 
vivarium. 

Heavy footsteps sounded outside 
the door. The vivarium guard jerked 
alert. When the door opened he was 
at attention. 

“Sit down there,” said one of Ho- 
bart’s escorts. Hobart sat. Tears had 
streaked his sunken cheeks. He 
donned his own headset, dropped his 
head back and was asleep. Peace 
spread across his face. The bigger 
guard asked, “Which one is Keller?” 

The vivarium guard consulted a 
chart. “Ninety-eight.” 

“Okay.” Instead of taking off Kel- 
ler’s headset, the man moved to a 
panel of one hundred buttons. He 
pushed #98. As Keller began to stir, 
they both moved in to attach hand- 
cuffs. Then they lifted the head- 
set. 

Matt Keller’s eyes opened. 

His new escorts lifted him to 
his feet with a practiced motion. 


SLOWBOAT CARGO

“On our way,” one said cheerfully. 
Bewildered, Matt followed the pull 
on his arms. In a moment they 
were in the hall. Matt snatched 
one look behind him before the 
door closed. 

“Wait a minute,” he protested, pre- 
dictably jerking back against the 
handcuffs. 

“Man wants to ask you a few 
questions. Look, I’d rather carry you 
than do this. .You want to walk?” 

The threat msually quieted them 
down — as it did now. Matt stopped 
pulling. He’d expected to wake up 
dead; these moments of conscious- 
ness were a free bonus. Someone 
must have gotten curious. 

“Who wants to see me?” 

“A gentleman named Castro,” the 
bigger guard tossed off. The didogue 
was following its usual pattern. If 
Keller was an average suspect, the 
Head’s dread name would paralyze 
his brain. If he kept his wits, he’d 
still choose to use this time in 
preparation for his interview, rather 
than risk a sonic now. Both guards 
had been doing this for so long that 
they’d come to see prisoners as face- 
less, interchangeable. 

Castro. The name echoed between 
Matt’s ears. 

What did you think you were do- 
ing, Keller? You came in here like 
you had an engraved invitation. 
Thought you had a secret weapon, 
did you Keller? What did you think 
you were doing, Keller? WHAT DID 
YOU THINK YOU — 

One instant the suspect was walk- 
ing between them, lost in his own 
fears. The next, he had jerked back 
like a fish hooked on two lines. The 


guards instantly pulled apart to string 
him between them, then regarded him 
in sheer disgust. One said, “Stupid!” 
The other pulled out his gun. 

They stood there, one with a sonic 
loose in his han^ looking about 
them in apparent bewilderment. Matt 
jerked again, and the smaller guard 
looked in shocked surprise at his own 
wrist. He fumbled in his ^j^lt, got 
out a* key and unlocked the hand- 
cuff. 

M att threw all his weight on the 
other steel chain. The bigger 
guard yelled in anger and pulled back. 
Matt flew into him, inadvertently 
butting him in the stomach. The 
guard hit him across the jaw with a 
backhand swing of his arm. Momen- 
tarily unable to move, Matt watched 
the guard take a key from his pocket 
and unlock the remaining handcuff 
from his own wrist. The guard’s 
eyes were strange. 

Matt backed away with two sets 
of handcuffs dangling from his arms. 
The guards looked after him, not at 
him but in his general direction. 
Something was very wrong with their 
eyes. Fruitlessly Matt tried to re- 
member where he’d seen that look 
before. The gateman, last night? 

The guards turned and sauntered 
away. 

Matt shook his head, more baffled 
than relieved, and turned back the 
way he had come. There was the 
vivarium door. He’d had only one 
backward glimpse, but he was sure 
he’d seen Harry Kane in there. 

The door was locked. 

Mist Demons, here we go again. 
Matt raised his hand, changed his 


110 


IP 



mind, changed it again and slapped 
the palm three times against the door. 
It opened at once. A round, express- 
ionless face looked through and sud- 
denly acquired an expression. The 
door started to close. Matt pulled it 
open and went in. 

The round guard with the round 
face genuinely didn’t know what to 
do. At least he hadn’t forgotten that 
Matt was here. Matt was grateful. 
He swung joyfully at the guard’s dou- 
ble chin. When the guard didn’t fold. 
Matt hit him again. The man finally 
reached for his gun, and Matt took 
a firm grip on the appropriate wrist, 
holding the gun in its holster, and 
swung once more. The guard slid to 
the floor. 

Matt took the guard’s sonic and 
put it in his pants pocket. His hand 
hurt. He rubbed it against his cheek, 
which also hurt, and ran his eyes 
down the row of sleepers. There was 
Laney! Laney, her face pale, with 
one thin scratch from temple to chin, 
her auburn hair concealing the three- 
pronged headset, her deep breasts 
hardly moving as she slept. And there 
was Hood, looking like a sleeping 
child .... Something began to un- 
wind inside Matt Keller, a warmth 
uncoiling to spread through his limbs. 
For hours he had been all alone 
with death. There was the tall man 
who’d spelled him for bartender that 
night. Night before last! There was 
Harry Kane, a cube of a man, 
strong even in sleep .... 

Polly wasn’t there. 

He looked again, carefully, and she 
still wasn’t there. 

Where was she? Instantly the 
aquarium tanks of the organ bank 


flashed into his mind’s eye. One 
t ank had held skins, whole human 
skins with barely room between them 
for the clear conducting/ nutrient 
fluid. The scalps had borne hair» 
short and long, blond and black and 
red, hair that waved in a cold fluid 
breeze. Rejection classes C, 2, nr, 34, 
He couldn’t remember seeing the 
space-blackness of Polly’s hair. It 
might or might not have been waving 
in the aquarium tank. He hadn’t 
been looking for it. 

Convulsively he made himself look 
about him. That bank of buttons? 
He pushed one. It popped out at the 
touch of a finger. Nothing else hap- 
pened. 

Oh, well, what the hell .... He 
started pushing them all, letting his 
forefinger run . down a row of ten, 
down the next row, and the next. He 
had released sixty when he heard mo- 
tion. The sleepers were waking. 

H e released the rest of the buttons. 

The murmur of awakening grew 
louder. Stretching, yawning, confused 
voices, clatterings, gasps of dismayed 
shock when prisoners suddenly re- 
alized where they were. A clear voice 
calling, “Matt? Matt!” 

“Here, Laney!” 

She wove her way toward him 
through people climbing groggily out 
of their contour couches. Then she 
was in his arms, and they clung to 
each other as if a tornado were try- 
ing to pluck them apart and whirl 
them away. Matt felt suddenly weak, 
as if he could afford weakness now. 
“So you didn’t make it,” he said. 

“Matt, where are we? I tried to 
get to the void edge — ” 


SLOWBOAT CARGO 


111 



Somebody bellowed, “We are in 
the Hospital vivariuml” The voice 
cut like an axe through the rising 
pandemonium. Harry Kane, Leader, 
assumed his proper role. 

“That’s right,” Matt said gently. 

Her eyes were two inches from his, 
dead level. “O/i. Then you didn’t 
make it either.” 

“Yes I did. I had to get here on 
my own.” 

“What — HowT 

“Good question. I don’t know ex- 
actly.” 

I^ney began to chuckle. 

Shouting from the back of the 
room. Somebody had noticed an Im- 
plementation ui^orm on one of the 
newly awakened. A scream of pure 
terror changed to a yell of agony and 
died abruptly. Matt saw jerking heads, 
heard sounds he tried to ignore. 
Laney wasn’t laughing any more. The 
disturbance subsided. 

Harry Kane had mounted a chair. 
He cupped his hands and bellowed, 
“Shut up, all of you! Everyone who 
knows the map of the Hospital, get 
over here! Gather round me!” There 
was a shifting in the mass. Laney 
and Matt still clung to each other, 
but not desperately now. Their heads 
turned to watch Harry, acknowl- 
edging his leadership. *Take a look, 
the rest of you!” Harry shouted. 
“There are the people who can lead 
you out of here. In a minute we’re 
going to have to make our break. 
Keep your eyes on — ” He named 
eight names. Hood’s was one. “Some 
of us are going to get shot. As long 
as one of these eight is still moving, 
follow him! Or her. If all eight are 
down, and I am too — ” He paused 


for emphasis. “Scatter! Make as 
much trouble as you can! Sometimes 
the only sensible thing to do is panic! 

“Now, who got us out of this? 
Who woke us up? Anyone?” 

“Me,” said Matt. 

A last buzz of noise died. Sudden- 
ly everyone was looking at him. 
Harry said, “How?” 

“I’m not sure how I got in here. 
I’d like to talk to Hood about it.” 
“Okay, stick with Jay. Keller, 
isn’t it? We’re grateful, Keller. What 
do those buttons do? I saw you fool- 
ing with them.” 

“They turn off whatever it is that 
makes you go to sleep.” 

“Is anyone still in his couch? If so, 
get out of it now. Now, somebody 
push those buttons back in so it’ll 
look like there was a power failure. 
Was that it, Keller? Did you just ac- 
cidentally wake up?” 

“No.” 

Harry Kane looked puzzled, but 
when Matt didn’t elaborate he 
shrugged. “Watson, Chek, start push- 
ing those buttons in. Jay, make sure 
you stick with Keller. The rest of you, 
are you ready to move?” 

TTiere was a shout of assent. As 
it died, a lone voice asked, “Where 
to?” 

“Good point. If you get free, make 
for the coral houses around the south 
void and Alpha-Beta cliffs. Anything 
else?” 

Nobody spoke, including Matt. 
Why ask questions to which no- 
body knew the answers? Matt was 
unutterably relieved to let someone 
else make the decisions for awhile. 
They might be just as wrong, but 
ninety-eight rebels could be a mighty

force, even moving in the wrong di- 
rection. And Harry Kane was a 
bom leader. 

Laney moved out of his arms, but 
kept a grip on one hand. Matt be- 
came conscious of the handcuffs 
dangling from his wrists. They might 
hamper him. Jay Hood moved up be- 
side him, looking rumpled. He shook 
hands, grinning, but the grin didn’t 
match the fear in his eyes, and he 
seemed reluctant to let go. Was there 
one person in this room who wasn’t 
terrified? If there was, it wasn’t Matt. 
He pulled the sonic loose from his 
pants pocket. 

“All out,” said Harry Kane, and 
butted the door open with a wide 
shoulder. They streamed into the 
hall. 

XIII 

4CT’ll take only a minute of your 
A time, Watts.” Jesus Pietro re- 
laxed indolently in his chair. He 
loved mysteries and proposed to en- 
joy this one. “I want you to describe 
in detail what happened last night, 
starting with the call from Hobart.” 

“But there aren*t any details, sir.” 
Master Sergeant Watts was tired of 
repeating himself. His voice was 
turning querelous. “Five minutes after 
your call, Hobart called and said he 
had a prisoner. I told him to bring 
him to my office. He never came. 
Finally I called the gate. He was 
there, all right, withow^ his prisoner, 
and he couldn’t explain what had 
happened. I had to put him under 
arrest.” 

“His behavior has been puzzling in 
other ways. That is why I ask, why 


didn’t you call the gate earlier?” 
“Sir?” 

“Your behavior is as puzzling as 
Hobart’s, Watts. Why did you as- 
sume it would take Hobart half aa 
hour to reach your office?” 

“Oh.” Watts fidgeted. “Well, Ho- 
bart said this bird came right up to 
the gate and started banging on it 
with a rock. When Hobart didn’t 
show right away I thought he must 
have stopped off to question the 
prisoner, find out why he did it. 
After all,” he explained hastily, if he 
brought the bird straight to me he’d 
likely never find out what he was 
doing banging on the gate.” 

“Very logical. Did it occur to you 
at any point that the ‘bird’ might 
have overpowered Hobart?” 

“But Hobart had a sonic!” 

“Watts, have, you ever been on a 
raid?” 

“No, sir. How could I?” 

“A man came back from the raid 
of night before last with the bones 
of his nose spread all over his face. 
He, too, had a sonic.” 

“Yessir, but that was a raid, sir.” 
Jesus Pietro sighed. “Thank you. 
Master Sergeant. Will you step out- 
side, please? Your bird should be ar- 
riving any minute.” 

Watts left, his relief showing. 

He’d made a good point, thought 
Jesus Pietro, though not the one he’d 
intended. Probably all the Hospital 
guards had the same idea: that a gun 
was, ipso facto, invincible. Why not? 
The Hospital guards had never been 
on a raid in the colonist regions. 
Few had ever seen a colonist 
who wasn’t unconscious. Occasionally 
Jesus Pietro staged mock raids with 


SLOWBOAT CARGO 


113 



guards playing the part of colonists. 
They di^’t mind, particularly; 
mercy-weapons were not unpleasant 
But the men with the guns always 
won. All the guards* experience told 
them that the gun was king, that a 
man who had a gun need fear noth- 
ing but a gun. 

W hat to do? Interchange guards 
and raiders long enough to give 
the guards some experience? No, the 
elite raiders would never stand for 
that. 

Why was he worrying about Imple- 
mentation? 

Had the Hospital ever been at- 
tacked? Never, on Alpha Plateau. A 
colonist force had no way to get 
here. 

But Keller had. 

He used the phone. **Jansen, find 
out who was on guard at the Alpha- 
Beta bridge last night Wake them 
up and send them here.** 

“It will be at least fifteen min- 
utes, sir.” 

“Fine.” 

How had Keller gotten past them? 
There had been one aircar on Gam- 
ma Plateau, but it had been destroy- 
ed here. With the pilot still in it? 
Had Keller had a chauffeur? Or . • . 
would a colonist know how to use 
the autopilot? 

Where the Mist Demons was,Kel- 
ler? 

Jesus Pietro began to pace the 
room. He had no cause for worry, 
yet he worried. Instinct? He didn’t be- 
lieve he had instincts. The phone 
spoke in his secretary’s voice. “Sir, 
did you order two guards?” 

“Bridge guards?” 


“No. Some intrahospital guards.” 

“No.” 

“Thank you.” Click. 

Something had set off the grounds 
alarms last night. Not a rabbit. Keller 
might have tried the wall first If 
the grounds guards had let a prisoner 
escape, then faked a report — he’d 
have tiieir hides! 

“Sir, these guards insist you sent 
for them.” 

“Well, I damn well didn’t. Tell 
them — just a minute. Send them 
in. 

They came, two burly men whose 
submissive countenances unsuccess- 
fully hid their ire at being made to 
wait. 

“When did I send for you?” asked 
Jesus Pietro. 

The big one said, “Twenty minutes 
ago,” daring Jesus Pietro to call him 
a liar. 

“Were you supposed to pick up a 
prisoner first?” 

“No, sir. We took Hobart to the 
vivarium, put him to beddybye and 
came straight back.” 

“You don’t remember being — ” 

The smaller guard went white. 
“D-dave! We were supposed to p-pick 
up someone. Keeler. Something Kee- 
ler.” 

Jesus Pietro regarded them for a 
full twenty seconds. His face was 
curiously immobile. Then he opened 
the intercom. “Major Jansen. Sound 
‘Prisoners Loose.’” 

44TTTait a minute,” said Matt. 

VV The tail end of the colonist 
swarm was leaving them behind. 
Hood brought himself up short. 
“What are you doing?” 


114 


IF 




Matt dodged back into the vi- 
varium. One man lay on his face 
with his headset on. Probably he’d 
thought he was safe once he was 
out of the couch. Matt snatched the 
headset off and slapped him twice, 
hard, and when his eyelids fluttered 
Matt pulled him to his feet and push- 
ed him at the door. 

Watson and Chek finished pushing 
buttons and left, running, shoving 
around Hood. 

“Come on!” Hood yelled from the 
doorway. Panic was in his voice. But 
Matt stood rooted by the thing on 
the floor. 

The guard. They’d torn him to 
pieces! 

Matt was back in the organ banks, 
frozen rigid by horror. 

“Keller!” 

Matt stooped, picked iip some- 
thing soft and wet. His expression 
was very strange. He stepped to the 
door, hesitated a moment, then drew 
two sweeping arcs and three small 
closed curves on its gleaming metal 
surface. He hurled the warm thing 
backhand, turned and ran. The two 
men and Laney charged down the 
haU, trying to catch the swarm. 

T he swarm poured down the stairs 
like a waterfall: a closepacked 
mass, running and stumbling against 
each other and brushing against walls 
and bannisters and generally making 
a hell of a lot of noise. Harry Kane 
led. A cold certainty was in his heart, 
the knowledge that he would be first 
to fall when they met the first 
armed guard. But by then the swarm 
should have unstoppable momentum. 
The first armed guard was several 


115 




yards beyond the first corner. He 
turned and stared as if his eyes beheld 
a miracle. He hadn’t moved when the 
mob reached him. Someone actually 
had the sense to take his gun. A 
tall blond man got it and immediate- 
ly forced his way to the front, waving 
it and yelling for room. The swarm 
flowed around and over the limp 
Implementation policeman. 

This hallway was long, lined with 
doors on both sides. Every door 
seemed to be swinging open at once. 
The man with the gun closed his fist 
on the trigger and waved it slowly 
up and down the hall. Heads peered 
out the doors, paused and were fol- 
lowed by falling bodies. The colonist 
swarm slowed to pick their way 
around the crewish and half-crewish 
fallen. Nonetheless, the fallen were 
all badly or mortally injured when 
the swarm passed. Implementation 
used mercy weapons because they 
needed their prisoners intact. The 
swarm had no such motive for 
mercy. 

The swarm was stretching now, 
dividing the fast from the slow, as 
Kane reached the end of the hall. He 
rounded the turn in a clump of 
six ... 

Two police were parked indolently 
against opposite walls, steaming cups 
in their hands, their heads turned 
to see where the noise was coming 
from. For a magic moment they stay- 
ed that way . and then their cups 
flew wide, trailing spiral nebulae of 
brown fluid, and their guns came up 
like flowing light. Harry Kane fell 
with a buzzing in his ears. But his 
last glimpse of the corridor showed 
him that the police were falling too. 


He lay like a broken doll, widi 
his head swimming and his eyes blur- 
ring and his body as numb as a 
frozen plucked chicken. Feet pound- 
ed past and over him. Through the 
blanketing numbness he dimly sensed 
himself being kicked. 

Abruptly four hands gripped his 
wrists and ankles, and he was o££ 
again, swaying and jouncing between 
his rescuers. Harry Kane was pleased. 
His opinion of mobs was low. This 
mob was behaving better than he had 
expected. Through the buzzing in his 
ears he heard a siren. 

A t the bottom of the stairs they 
reached the tail of the swarm: 
Laney in the lead. Matt and Jay 
Hood following. Matt panted, “Stay! 
Got . gun.” 

Laney saw the point and slowed. 
Matt could guard the rear. If they 
tried to reach the front of the swarm 
they’d be stuck in the middle, ' and 
the sonic would be useless. 

But nobody came to them from 
the rear. There were noises ahead, 
and they passed sprawled bodies: 
one policeman, then a string of men 
and women in lab smocks. Matt 
found his stomach trying to turn in- 
side out. The rebels’ visciousness was 
appalling. So was Hood’s grin: a tight 
killer’s grin, making a lie of his 
scholar’s face. 

Ahead, more commotion. Two me* 
stopped to lift a heavy, sprawled 
figure and continued running. Harry 
Kane was out of the action. “Hope 
somebody’s leading them!” Hood 
shouted. 

A siren blared in the corridors. 

It was loud enough to wake the 

IF 


116 



Mist Demons, to send them scream- 
ing into the sky for a little peace. 
It jarred the concrete, it shook the 
very bones of a man. There was a 
rattling clang, barely heard above 
the siren. An iron door had dropped 
into the swarm, cutting it in two. One 
man was emphatically dead beneath 
it. The tail of the swarm, including 
perhaps a dozen men and women, 
washed against the steel door and re- 
bounded. 

Trapped. The other end of the cor- 
ridor was also blocked. But doors 
lined both sides. One man took off, 
running down the hallway toward 
the far end, swiveling his head back 
and forth to look briefly through the 
open doors, ignoring the closed ones. 
“Here!” he shouted, waving an arm. 
Wordlessly the others followed. 

It was a lounge, a relaxation room, 
furnished with four wide couches, 
scattered chairs, two card tables and 
a huge coffee dispenser. And a pic- 
ture window. As Matt reached the 
door the window already gaped wide, 
showing sharp glass teeth. The man 
who’d found the room was using a 
chair to clean the glass away. 

An almost soundless hum . and 
Matt felt the numbness of a sonic 
beamer. From the doorway I He 
slammed the door, and it stopped. 

Automatics? 

“Benny!” Laney shouted, picking 
up one end of a couch. The man at 
the window dropped his chair and 
ran to take the other end. He’d been 
one of Laney’s escorts, that night. 
Together they dropped the couch 
across the window sill, over the 
broken glass. Colonists began to climb 
over it. 


Hood had found a closet and open- 
ed it. It was like opening Pandora’s 
box. Matt saw half a dozen men in 
white smocks swarm over Hood. In 
seconds they would have tom him to 
ribbons. Matt used his sonic. They 
all went down in a lump, including 
Hood. Matt pulled him out, draped 
him over a shoulder and followed the 
others over the couch. Hood was 
heavier than he looked. 

He had to drop Hood on the grass 
and follow him down. Far across 
the lawn was the Hospital wall, lean- 
ing outward, the top laced with 
wires that leaned inward. Very thin 
wire, just barely visible throu^ the 
thin fog. Matt picked Hood up, 
glanced around, saw the others run- 
ning alongside the building with the 
tall man named Benny in the lead. 
He staggered after them. 

They reached a corner — the 
Hospital seemed to have a million 
comers — stopped sharply and back- 
ed up, milling. Guards coming? Matt 
put Hood down, hefted his sonic — 

A gun and hand emerged questing 
from the broken picture window. 
Matt fired, and the man slumped. But 
there must be others in there. Matt 
ducked beneath the window, rose sud- 
denly and fired in. Half a dozen po- 
lice fired back. Matt’s right side and 
arm went numb; he dropped the gun, 
then he himself dropped below the 
sill. In a moment they’d be peering 
over — The man named Benny was 
running toward him. Matt threw the 
first policeman’s sonic to him and 
picked up his own with his left hand. 

The men inside hadn’t expected 
Benny. They were trying to fire over 
the sill at Matt, and to do that

they had to lean out. In half a min- 
ute it was over. 

Benny said, “There’s a carport 
just beyond that corner. Guarded.” 
“Do they know we’re here?” 

“I don’t think so. The Mist De- 
mons have given us a mist.” Benny 
smiled at his own pun. 

“Good. We can use these guns. 
You’ll have to carry Jay, my arm’s 
out.” 

“Jay’s the only one who can fly.” 
“I can,” said Matt. 


Tajor Jansen. Sound ‘Prisoners 
IVl Loose.’ ” 

The sound of the siren pame in- 
stantly, even before Jesus Pietro 
could change his mind. For a mo- 
ment he was sure, pretematuraUy 
sure that he’d made a fool of him- 
self. This could cost him much 
face .... 


But no. Keller must be freeing the 
prisoners. Keller wasn’t here; there- 
fore Keller was free; his first move 
would be to free the other Sons of 
Earth; if the vivarium guard had 
stopped him he would then have call- 
ed here; he hadn’t called; hence Kel- 
ler had succeeded. 

But if Keller were harmlessly asleep 
in the vivarium? Nonsense. Why had 
the guards forgotten about him? They 
were behaving too much like Ho- 
bart had behaved last night. A mira- 
cle had been worked, a miracle of 
the kind Jesus Pietro was beginning 
to associate with Keller. There must 
be some purpose to it. 

It must have been used to free 
Keller. 

And the halls must be full of angry 
rebels. 


That was very^ bad. Implementa- 
tion had motives for using mercy 
weapons. Rebels had none — neither 
mercy-weapons nor mercy-motives. 
They’d kill whoever got in their way. 

The steel doors would be in place 
now, vibrating in sleep-producing fre- 
quencies. By now the danger would 
be over — almost certainly. Unless 
the rebels had first gotten out of the 
halls. 

But what damage had they done 
already? 

“Come with me,” Jesus Pietro told 
the two guards. He marched toward 
the door. “Keep your guns drawn,” 
he added over his shoulder. 

The guards snapped out of their 
stupor and ran to catch up. They had 
not the least idea what was going on, 
but Jesus Pietro was sure they’d 
recognize a colonist in time to down 
him. They’d be adequate protection. 

O ne dozen colonists, two stunned. 
Seven captured guns. 

Matt stayed hidden behind the 
corner, reluctantly obeying Benny’s 
orders. With him were the two 
women, Laney and a deep-voiced 
middle-aged tigress named Lydia 
Hancock, and the two fallen: Jay 
Hood and Marry Kane. 

Matt would have fought the car- 
port guards, but he couldn’t fight 
the logic. Because he was the only 
one who could fly a car, he had to 
stay behind while the others charged 
out onto the field with their sonics 
going. 

The carport was a big, flat ex- 
panse of lawn, a variant of mutant 
grass, which could take an infinite 
amount of trampling. Lines of near- 


118 


IF 



white crossed the green, outlining 
landing targets. The white too was 
grass. Cars rested near the centers of 
two of the targets. Men moved about 
the cars, servicing them and remov- 
ing met^ cannisters from the under- 
bellies. The mist hung four feet 
above the grass under diffuse sunlight, 
curling about the rebels as they ran. 

They were halfway to the cars 
when someone on the Hospital wall 
swung a spotlight-sized sonic toward 
them. The rebels dropped immediate- 
ly, like hay before a scythe. So did 
the mechanics aroimd the cars. Un- 
conscious men lay scattered across 
the carport field with the mist curling 
around them. 

Matt pulled his head back as the 
big sonic swung toward the corner. 
Even so, he felt the numbness, faint 
and far-off, matching the deadwood 
feeling in his right arm. “Shall we 
wait ’til they turn it off, then run 
for it?” 

“I think they’ve got us,” said 
Laney. 

“Stop that!” Mrs. Hancock rapped 
savagely. Matt had first met her 
fifteen minutes ago and had never 
seen her without her present en- 
raged expression. She was a fierce one, 
bulky and homely, a natural for any 
cause. “They haven’t got us until they 
take us!” 

“Something keeps people from see- 
ing me sometimes,” said Matt. “If 
you want to risk it, and if you all 
stay close to me, it may protect us 
all.” 

“ ‘Crack’ under strain.” Hood’s 
voice was slurred, barely compre- 
hensible. Only his eyes moved to 
watch Matt. Harry too was awake. 


“It’s true. Hood. I don’t know 
why, but it’s true. 1 think it must be 
a psi power.” 

“Wreebody who believes in psi 
things hees psygic.” 

“The sonic’s off us,” said Laney. 
“My arm’s dead. Laney, you and 
Mrs. — ” 

“Call me Lydia.” 

“You and Lydia put Hood over my 
left shoulder, then pick up Harry. 
Stay right by me. We’ll be walking, 
remember. Don’t try to hide. If we 
get shot. I’ll apologize when I get 
the chance.” 

“ ’Pologize now.’ ” 

“Okay, Hood. I’m sorry I got us 
all killed.” 

“ ‘Sawrigh.’ ” 

XIV 

W hen they see this .... Jesus 
Pietro shuddered. He watched 
his own guards shrink back, imwill- 
ing to enter, unable to look away. 
Theyil think a little less of their 
guns, when they see this! 

The vivarium guard had certainly 
had a gun. Probably he hadn’t thought 
to draw it in time. 

He’d get no second chance. 

He was like something spilled from 
an organ bank conveyor tank. 

Hobart, dead near the back of the 
vivarium, was no prettier. Jesus Pie- 
tro felt a stab of guilt. He hadn’t 
meant Hobart for such a fate. 

Aside from the bodies, the vivarium 
was empty. Naturally. 

Jesus Pietro looked once more 
around him . and his eyes found 
the door, and the dark scrawl on 
its bright steel surface.

It was a symbol of some kind, he 
was sure of that. But of what? The 
symbol of the Sons of Earth was a 
circle containing a streamlined out- 
line of the American supercontinent. 
This was nothing like it, nor was it 
like anything he knew of. But it had 
unmistakably been drawn in human 
blood. 

Two wide arcs, bilaterally sym- 
metrical. Three small closed curves 
underneath, like circles with tails. 
Tadpoles? Some micro-organism? 

Jesus Pietro rubbed the heels of 
his hands into his eyes. Later he’d 
ask the prisoners. Best forget it for 
now. 

“Assume they took the fastest 
route to the main entrance,” he said 
aloud. If the guards were surprised 
to hear him thus lecture himself, they 
reacted as Major Jansen had learned 
long since. They said nothing. 
“Come,” said Jesus Pietro. 

Left, right, down the stairs . 
a dead policeman sprawled in the 
hall, his Implementation uniform as 
torn and ruined as himself. Jesus Pie- 
tro passed him without breaking his 
juggernaut stride. He reached steel 
emergency doors and used his ul- 
trasonic whistle. As the doors went 
up his guards tensed. 

Two pitiful rows of maimed and 
dead, and another steel door at the 
other end. The dead were like an ex- 
plosion in the organ banks. That was 
definitely the way to think of them. 
It would not do to consider that 
these had been human beings under 
Jesus Pietro’s protection. Most had 
not even been police, but civilians: 
doctors and electricians. 

What a valuable lesson the Hos- 

420 


pital guards would learn from thisi 
Jesus Pietro felt sick. It showed only 
in his unusual pallor; but that he 
could not control. He marched down 
the corridor with his expression held 
remotely aloof. The steel doors went 
up as he approached. 

Colonists were piled against the 
steel doors at both ends, as if trying 
to escape the trap even while unc(m- 
scious. One of the poUcemen spoke 
into a handphone, asking for stretch- 
ers. 

Jesus Pietro stood over the piled 
rebels. “I never really hated them 
before,” he said. 

4 41 ^ ’Hr, use gyrsco’.” 

“What?” Matt couldn’t spare 
the attention. He was trying to fly 
with one hand, the wrong hand: his 
car bucked and weaved. 

“Gy rro skko’!” Hood enunciated 
painfully. 

“I see it. What do I do with it?” 

“Turr on.” 

Matt flipped the Gyroscope switch 
to On. Something hummed below 
him. The car trembled, then righted 
itself, going straight up. 

“Shlatsh.” 

Matt used the knob. The car began 
to accelerate. 

“Her me see ow’, Laney.” Hood 
was propped upright beside the left 
front window, with Harry Kane in the 
middle and Matt on the right. Laney 
reached from the back seat to hold 
Hood’s head out the window. 

“Turn ri’.” 

“How?” 

“Shtee ring nog.” 

“Knob? Like this thing?” 

“Ye-ss i’iot.” 

IF 



“For the record,” Matt said icily, 
“I flew a car all the way from 
Harry’s basement to Alpha Plateau. 
It was the first time I’d ever been in 
a car. Naturally I don’t know what 
all these gadgets do.” 

“Thass ri’. Now go strray’ till I 
tell you.” 

Matt released the knob. The car 
flew on by itself. “We aren’t going 
toward the coral houses,” he said. 

“No.” Harry Kane spoke slowly 
but understandably. “The cor^ 
houses are the first place Implemen- 
tation will look. I couldn’t drag a 
hundred men where we’re going.” 
“Where’s that?” 

“A large, unoccupied mansion own- 
ed by Geoffrey Eustace Parlette and 
his family.” 

“And where will Geoffrey Eustace 
Parlette be all this time?” 

“He and his family are swimming 
and gambling in a sma(l public re- 
sort on Iota. I’ve got contacts on 
Alpha Plateau, Keller.” 

“Parlette. Any — ” 

“His grandson. Millard Parlette 
was staying with them, but he’s 
making a speech. He should be start- 
ing about now. The sending station 
on Nob Hill is far enough away, 
and his hosts here are gone, so he’ll 
probably be staying with a relative.” 
“It still sounds dangerous.” 

**You should talk.” 

The left-handed compliment hit 
Matt like six dry martinis. He’d done 
it! He’d walked into the Hospital, 
freed prisoners, raised merry hell, left 
his mark and walked out free and 
untouched! “We can hide the car 
till the furor dies down,” he said. 
“Then, back to Gamma — ” 


“And leave my men in the vi- 
varium? I can’t do that. And there’s 
Polly Tournquist.” 

Polly. The girl who’d — Yes. 
“I’m not a rebel, Harry. The grand 
rescue’s over. Frankly, I only came 
here to get Laney if I could. I can 
drop this crusade any time.” 

“You think Castro will just let 
you go, Keller? He must know you 
were one of the prisoners. He’ll hunt 
you down wherever you hide. Besides, 
I can’t let you have the car. I’ll need 
it for my grand rescue.” 

M att grimaced. It was his car, 
wasn’t it? He’d stolen it himself. 
But they could fight that out later. 
“Why did you mention Polly?” 

“She saw the ramrobot come down. 
Castro probably found the films on 
her. He may be questioning her to 
find out who else knows.” 

“Knows what?” 

“I don’t know either. Polly’s the 
only one. But it must be pretty damn 
important. Polly thought so, and ap- 
parently so did Castro. You didn’t 
know there was a ramrobot coming, 
did you?” 

“No.” 

“They kept it secret. They’ve never 
done that before.” 

Laney said, “Polly acted like she’d 
found something vastly important. 
She insisted on telling us all at once, 
night before last. But Castro didn’t 
give her the chance. Now I’m won- 
dering whether it wasn’t the ram- 
robot that brought on the raid.” 
“She could be in the organ banks,” 
said Matt. 

“Not yet,” said Harry. “Not if 
Castro found the films. She wouldn’t

have talked yet. He’ll be usiag the 
coffin cure, and that takes time.** 
“Coffin cure?” 

“It’s not important” 

Important or not Matt didn’t like 
the sound of it. ”How are you plan- 
ning to mount your rescue?” 

“I don’t know yet” 

“Angle lef,” said Hood. 

Houses and greenery rolled be- 
neath them. Flying a car was infinite- 
ly easier with the gyroscopes gdflg. 
Matt could see no cars around^ 
police or otherwise. Had something 
grounded them? 

“So,” said Laney. “You came aU 
the Way to the Hospital to get me.” 
“In a stolen car,” said Matt “With 
a small detour into the void mist” 
Laney’s wide mouth formed half a 
smile and half a grin, half joy and 
half amusement. “Naturally I’m 
flattered.” 

“NaturaUy.” 

Mrs. Hancock spoke from the back 
seat. “I’d like to know why they 
didn’t beam us down, back there at 
the carport.” 

“And you knew they wouldn’t,” 
said Laney. “How did you know. 

Matt?” 

“Second the motion,” said Harry 
Kane. 

“I don’t know,” said Matt. 

“But you knew it might work.” 
“Yah.” 

“Why?” 

“Okay. Hood, you listening?” 

“Ye ss.” 

“It’s a long story. I’ll start with 
the morning after the party — ” 
“Start with the party,” said Laney. 
“Everything?” 

“Everything.” Laney gave the 


word undue emphasis. “I think k 
mi^t be important. Matt” 

Matt shrugged an uncomfortable 
surrender. “It might at that Okay. 
I met Hood in a bar for the firat 
time in eight years . .” 

J esus Pietro and Major Jansen stood 
well out of the way as a stream 
of stretchers moved into the vi- 
varium to deposit their charges in con- 
tour couches. In another part of the 
Hospital, other stretchers carried dead 
and wounded into the operating 
rooms, some to be restored to life 
and health and usefulness, others to 
be pirated for undamaged body parts. 
“What is it?” Jesus Pietro asked. 
“I don’t know,” said Major Jan- 
sen. He stepped back from the door. 
“It seems almost familiar.” 

“That’s no help.” 

“I assume a colonist drew it?” 
“You might as well. Nobody else 
was left alive.” 

Major . Jansen drew even further 
back, stood bouncing lightly on his 
toes, hands on hips. Finally he said, 
“It’s a valentine, sir.” 

“A valentine.” Jesus Pietro glared 
intense irritation at his aide. He 
looked back at the door. “I’ll be 
damned. It is a valentine.” 

“With teardrops.” 

“A valentine with teardrops. Who- 
ever drew that wasn’t sane. Valen- 
tine, valentine .... Why would the 
Sons of Earth leave us a valentine 
drawn in human blood?” 

“Blood. A bleeding ... oh, I see. 
That’s what it is, sir. It’s a bleeding 
heart. They’re telling us they’re 
against the practice of executing 
felons for the organ banks.”

IF 






“A reasonable attitude for them to 
take.” Jesus Pietro looked once more 
into the vivarium. The bodies of Ho- 
bart and the vivarium guard had been 
removed, but the stains of carnage 
remained. He said, “They don’t act 
like the usual sort of bleeding heart.” 
Thirty thousand pairs of eyes wait- 
ed behind the teedee lenses. 

Four teedee cameras circled him. 
They were blank now and untended, 
as cameramen moved casually about 
the room, doing things and saying 
things Millard Parlette made no effort 
to understand. In fifteen minutes 
those blank tedee lenses would be 
peepholes for sixty thousand eyes.

through his notes. If there were 
any changes to be made, the time 
was Now.

C **What follows is background** 
How real would an emergency 
seem to these people? The last 
emergency session Millard Parlette 
could recall was the Great Plague of

of his audience ^ould not have been 
born then. 

Hence the lead-in, to grab their 
attention. 

II The organ bank problem — ex- 
position 

A Earth calls it a problem; we 
do not. Therefore Earth knows 
considerably more about it. 

B Any citizen, with the help of 
the organ banks, can live as 


long as it take his central net- 
vous system to wear out. This 
can be a very long time, if his 
circulatory system is kept func^ 
Honing. 

C But the citizen cannot take 
more out of the organ banks 
than goes into them. He must 
do his utmost to see that they 
are supplied. 

D The only feasible method of 
supplying the organ banks is 
through execution of criminals. 
(Demonstrate this, show why 
other methods are irutdequate.) 

E A criminaTs pirated body can 
save a dozen lives. There is now 
no valid argument against capU 
tal punishment for any given 
crime; for all such argument 
seeks to prove that killing a 
man does society no good. 
Hence the citizen, who wants 
to live as long and as healthily 
as possible, will vote any crime 
into a capital crime if the or- 
gan banks are short of mater- 
ial. 

1) Cite Earths capital punish- 
ment for false advertising, 
income-tax evasion, air 
pollution, having children 
without a license. 

The wonder was that it had taken 
so long to pass these laws. 

The organ bank problem could 
have started in the year 1900, when 
Carl Landsteiner separated human 
blood into four types. A, B, AB, and 
O. Or in 1914, when Albert Hustin 
found that sodiiun citrate would pre- 
vent blood from clotting. Or in 1940, 
when Landsteiner and Weiner found 
the Rh factor. Blood banks could so 


724 


IF 



easily have been supplied by con- 
demn^ cnndn^; bpt apparently no- 
body had realized it. 

And there was Hamburger’s work 
in the 1960’s and 1970’s, in a Pari- 
sian hospital where the first kidney 
transplants were made from donors 
who were not identical twins. There 
were the antirejection serums discov- 
ered by Mostel and Granovich in the 
2010’s 

Nobody seemed to have noticed 
the implications. Until the middle of 
the twenty-first century. 

There were organ banks all over 
the world, inadequately supplied by 
people kind enough to leave their 
bodies to medical science in their wills. 
How useful is the body of a man 
who dies of old age? How fast can 
you reach a car accident? And in 
2043 Arkansas, which had never res- 
cinded the death penalty, made the 
organ banks the official state method 
of execution. 

T he idea had spread like wildfire 
. like a moral plague, as one 
critic of the time had put it. MUlard 
Parlette had researched it very 
thoroughly, then cut all of the histori- 
cal matter out of his speech, afraid 
it would lose him his audience. Peo- 
ple, especially crew, did not like to 
be lectured. 

F Thus the government which 
controls the organ banks is 
more powerful than any dicta- 
tor in history. Many dictators 
have had the power of death; 
but organ banks give a gov- 
ernment power of life and 
death. 

1) Life. The organ banks can 


cure nearly anything, and 
the government can regu- 
late which citizens shtdl 
benefit, on grounds that 
materials are running short. 
Priorities become vital. 

2) Death. No citizen will pro- 
test when the government 
condemns a man to die, not 
when his death gives the 
citizen his chance to live. 

Untrue and unfair. There were al- 
ways altruists. But let it stand.

A Alloplasty: the science of put- 
ting foreign materials in the 
human body for medical pur- 
poses. 

B Examples 

1) Implanted hearing aids 

2) Heart pacemakers and arti- 
ficial hearts 

3) Plastic tubing for veins, 
arteries 

C Alloplasty in use on Earth for 
half a thousand years. 

D No alloplasty for a colony 
world, Alloplasty needs a high 
technology. 

E Every colony world has organ 
bank facilities. The stasis room 
of a slowboat is designed to 
freeze organs. The ships them- 
selves thus become the center 
of an organ bank. 

F Thus the organ bank **prob- 
lem'' is unrelieved even by the 
alternative of alloplasty, on any 
colony world. 

IV The organ bank problem — as 
it relates to the power politics of 
Mount Lookitthat. 

A The Covenant of Planet fall.

Millard Parlette frowned. How 
would the average crew react to the 
truth about the Covenant of Planet- 
faU? 

What they were taught in school 
was true, in the main. The Covenant 
of Planetfall, the agreement which 
gave the crew authority over the 
colonists, had existed since the Planck 
landing. The colonists had agreed to 
it, all of them. 

The rationale held, too. The crew 
had taken all the risks, done all the 
work of decades, suffered and slaved 
through years of training, to reach a 
target which might be habitable. The 
colonists had slept peacefully through 
aU those weary years in space. It 
was right that the crew should rule. 

But — how many crew knew that 
those first colonists had signed the 
covenant at gunpoint? That eight had 
died rather than sign away their free- 
dom? 

Was it Millard Parlette’s place to 
tell them? 

Y es, it was. They had to under- 
stand the nature of power poli- 
tics. He left the notation unchanged. 
B The HospitaL 

1 ) Control of electric power, 

2) Control of news media, 

3) Control of justice: of the 
police, of trials, of execu- 
tions, 

4) Control of medicine and the 
organ banks: the positive 
side of justice, 

C Organ replacement for colonists? 
Yes! 

1) Colonists in good standing 
are obviously entitled to 
medical care, 

126 ’ 


2) Justice must have a positive 
side, 

3) The organ bank **problenf* 
implies that the colonists 
who can hope for medical 
treatment will support the 
government. 

V The ramrobot capsule, 

{Show pictures. Give 'em the full 
tour. Use #i for visual impact, but 
concentrate on implications of roti- 
fer,) 

There was something he could add 
to that! Millard Parlette looked down 
at his right hand. It was coming along 
nicely. Already the contrast with his 
untreated left hand was dramatic. 

ThaPd make ’em sit up! 

VI The danger of the ramrobot cap- 
sule, 

A It does not make the organ 
banks obsolete. The capsule 
held only four items. To re- 
place the organ banks would 
require hundreds, or thou- 
sands, each a separate pro- 
ject. 

B But any colonist report would 
blow it out of all proportion. 
Colonists would assume that 
capital punishment would stop 
now. 

Millard Parlette glanced behind 
him . and shuddered. You couldn’t 
be rational about Ramrobot Capsule 
#143. The visual impact was too 
great. 

K his speech got dull at any point, 
he could get their attention back by 
simply cutting to a shot of the ram- 
robot packages. 

C Capital punishment cannot 
stop at any case. 

1) Decrease the severity of 

IF 



punishment, and crime in-- 
creases drastically. (Cite ex-^ 
amples from Earth history. 
Unfortunate that Mount 
Lookitthat has none.) 

2) What punishment to sub* 
stitute for capital punish* 
ment? No prisons on Mount 
Lookitthat. Warning notes 
and jottings on one's rec* 
ord hold power only 
through threat of the organ 
banks. 

Vlll. Conclusion: 

Violently or peaceably, the rule 
of the crew ends when the 
colonists learn of Ramrobot 
Capsule #143. 

T hree minutes to go. No question 
of changing the speech now. 
The question was, and had always 
been, the speech itself. Should thirty 
thousand crew be told what had ar- 
rived in Ramrobot Capsule #143? 
Could they be made to understand 
its importance? And — could such a 
secret be kept by that many? 

Members of the Council had 
fought bitterly to prevent this event. 
Only Millard Parlette’s sure control, 
his knowledge of the ways of power 
and the weaknesses of his fellow 
Council members, even his own strik- 
ing authority-figure appearance, which 
he used ruthlessly — only Millard 
Parlette’s determination had brought 
the Council to issue their declaration 
of emergency. 

And now every crew on Alpha 
Plateau, and elsewhere, was before 
his teedee set. No cars flew above Al- 
pha Plateau; no skiers glided down 
the snows of the northern glacier; 

SLOWBOAT CARGO 


the lake and the hot springs and the 
gambling halls of Iota were empty. 

One minute to go. Too late to 
call off the speech. 

Could thirty thousand people keep 
such a secret? 

Why, no, of course they couldn’t.

44^T^hat big house with the flat 
A roof,” said Harry Kane. 

Matt tilted the car to the right. He 
continued, “I waited ’til the guards 
were out of sight, then went back 
to the vivarium. The man inside open- 
ed the door for me. I knocked him 
down and took his gun, found that 
bank of buttons and started pushing 
them.” 

“Land in the garden, not on the 
roof. Did you ever figure out what 
was wrong with their eyes?” 

“No.” Matt worked the slats and 
the steering knob, trying to get above 
the garden. It was big, and it ran 
to the void edge: a formal garden 
in a style a thousand years old, a 
symmetrical maze of right-angle 
hedges enclosing rectangles of bril- 
liant color. The house too was all 
rectangles, an oversized version of the 
small identical development houses 
of the nineteens. Flat-roofed, flat- 
sided, nearly undecorated, the size 
of a motel but so wide it seemed low, 
the house seemed to have been built 
from prefabricated parts and then 
added to over the years. Geoffrey 
Eustace Parlette had evidently imi- 
tated ancient bad taste in hopes of 
getting something new and different. 

Matt didn’t see it that way, 
naturally. To him all the houses of 

127 



Alpha appeared equally strange. 

He brought the car down on the 
strip of grass at the void edge. The 
car landed, bounced, landed again. 
At what he judged was the proper 
moment Matt pushed in all four fan 
levers. The car dropped jarringly. The 
levers tried to come out again, and 
Matt held them in with his hand, 
looking despairingly at Hood for 
help. 

“Gyroscope,” said Hood. 

Matt forced his numb right arm 
to cross his torso and flick the Gyro- 
scope switch. 

“You need a little training in how 
to fly,” Harry Kane said with ad- 
mirable restraint **Yon finidied your 
story?” He had indsted that Matt 
talk without interruption. 

“I may have forgotten some 
things.” 

“We can save the question-and- 
answer period until we get establi^- 
ed. Matt, Laney, Lydia, get me out 
of here and move Jay in front of the 
dashboard. Jay, can you move your 
arms?” 

“Yah. The stunner’s pretty well 
worn off.” 

They piled out. Matt and the two 
women. Harry came out on his feet, 
moving in jerks and twitches but 
managing to stay He brush- 

ed away offers of help and stood 
watching Hood. Hood had opened 
a panel in the dash and was doing 
things inside. 

“Matt!” Laney called over her 
shoulder. She was standing inches 
from the void. 

“Get back from therel” 

“No! Come here!” 

Matt went. So did Mrs. Hancock. 


The three of them stood at the edge 
of the grass, looking down into their 
shadows. 

The sun was at their backs, shining 
down at forty-five degrees. The water- 
vapor mist which had covered the 
southern end of the Plateau that 
morning now lay just beyond the void 
edge, almost at their feet. And they 
looked into their shadows . • . three 
shadows reaching down into infinity, 
three contoured black tunnels grow- 
ing smaller and narrower as they 
bored through the lighted mist, untfl 
they reached their blurred vanishing 
points. But for each of the three it 
seemed that only his own shadow 
was surrounded by a small, vivid, per- 
fectly circular rainbow. 

A fourth shadow joined them, 
moving slowly and painfully. “Oh, for 
a camera,” mourned Harry Kane. 

“I never saw it like that before,” 
said Matt. 

*1 did, once, a long time ago. It 
was like I’d had a vision. Myself, the 
representative of Man, standing at 
the edge of the world with a rainbow 
about his head. I joined the Sons of 
Earth that night.” 

A muted whirr sounded behind 
them. Matt turned to see the car 
slide toward him across the lawn, 
pause at the edge, go over. It hover- 
ed over the mist and then settled into 
it, fading like a porpoise submerg- 
ing. 

Harry turned and called, “All 
set?” 

Hood knelt on the grass where 
the car had rested. “Right. It’ll come 
back at midnight, wait fifteen minutes, 
then go back down. It’ll do that for

IP 



the next three nights. Would someone 
help me into the house?” 

Matt half -carried him through the 
formal garden. Hood was heavy; his 
legs would move, but they would not 
carry him. As they walked, he lower- 
ed his voice to ask, “Matt, what was 
that thing you drew on the door?” 
“A bleeding heart.” 

“Oh. Why?” 

“I’m not really sure. When I saw 
what they’d done to the guard it was 
like being back in the organ banks. 
I remembered my Uncle Matt.” His 
grip tightened in reflex on Hood’s 
arm. “They took him away when I 
was eight. I never found out why. 
I had to leave something to show I 
was there . me, Matt Keller, walk- 
ing-in alone and out with an army. 
One for Uncle Matt! I was a little 
crazy. Hood; I saw something in 
the organ banks that would shake 
anyone’s mind. I didn’t know your 
symbol, so I had to make up my 
own.” 

“Not a bad one. I’ll show you 
ours later. Was it bad, the organ 
banks?” 

“Horrible. But the worst was those 
tiny hearts and livers. Children, Jay! 
I never knew they took children.” 
Hood looked up questioningly. 
Then Lydia Hancock pushed the big 
front door open for them, and they 
had to concentrate on getting up the 
steps. 

esus Pietro was furious. 

He’d spent some time in his of- 
fice, knowing he would be most use- 
ful there, but he’d felt cramped. Now 
he was at the edge of the carport 
watching the last of the sonic vic- 


tims being carried away. He wore a 
belt phone; his secretary could reach 
him through that. 

He’d never hated colonists before. 

To Jesus Pietro human beings 
came in two varieties: crew and 
colonist. On other worlds other con- 
ditions might apply, but other worlds 
did not intrude on Mount Lookitthat. 
The crew were masters, wise and 
benevolent, at least in the aggregate. 
The colonists were ordained to serve. 

Both groups had exceptions. There 
were crew who were in no way wise, 
and who did not work at being 
benevolent; who accepted the bene- 
fits of their world and ignored the 
responsibilities. There were colonists 
who would overthrow the established 
order of things, and others who pre- 
ferred to turn criminal rather than 
serve. When brought into contact with 
crew he did not admire, Jesus Pietro 
treated them with the respect due 
their station. The renegade colonists 
he hunted down and punished. 

But he didn’t hate them, any more 
than Matt Keller really hated min- 
ing worms. They were part of his 
job, part of his working day. They 
behaved as they did because they 
were colonists, and Jesus Pietro 
studied them as biology students 
studied bacteria. When his working 
day ended so did his interest in colon- 
ists, unless something unusual was 
going on. 

Now that was over. In running 
amok through the Hospital, the rebels 
ha(T spilled over from his working 
day into his very home. He couldn’t 
have been angrier if they’d been in 
his house, smashing furniture and 
killing servants and setting poison

for the housecleaners and pouring 
salt on the nrgs. 

The intercom buzzed. Jesus Pietro 
unhooked it from his belt and said» 
“Castro.” 

“Jansen» sir. I’m calling from the 
vivarium.” 

“WeU?” 

“There are six rebels missing. Do 
you want their names?” 

Jesus Pietro glanced around him. 
They’d carried the last unconscious 
colonist away ten minutes ago. These 
last stretcher passengers were carport 
personnel. 

“You should have them all. Have 
you checked with the operating room? 
1 saw at least one dead under a 
door.” 

“I’U check, sir.” 

T he carport was back to normal. 

The rebels hadn’t had time to 
mess it up, as they’d messed up the 
halls and the electricians’ re( room. 
Jesus Pietro debated whether to re- 
turn to his office or to trace the 
rebels’ charge back through the rec 
room. Then he happened to notice 
two men arguing by the garages. He 
strolled over. 

“You had no right to send Bessie 
out!” one was shouting. He wore a 
raider’s uniform, and he was tall, 
very dark, enlistment-poster hand- 
some. 

“You bloody raiders think you own 
these cars,” the mechanic said con- 
temptuously. 

Jesus Pietro smiled, for the 
mechanics felt exactly the same. 
“What’s the trouble?” he asked. 

“This idiot can’t find my car! 
Sorry, sir.” 


“And which car is yours, Cap^?** 
“Bessie. I’ve been using Bessie for 
three years, and this morning some 
idiot took it out to spray the woods. 
Now look! They’ve lost her, sir!” 
The man’s voice turned plaintive. 

Jesus Pietro turned cold blue eyes 
on the mechanic. “You’ve lost a 
car?” 

“Nossir. I just don’t happen to 
know where they’ve put it.” 
“Where are the cars that came 
back from spraying the woods?” 
“That’s one of them.” The mechan- 
ic pointed across the carport. “We 
were half finished unloading her when 
those fiends came at us. Matter of 
fact we were unloading both of them.” 
The mechanic scratched his head. He 
met Jesus Pietro’s eyes with the ut- 
most reluctance. “1 haven’t seen* the 
other one since.” 

“There are prisoners missing. You 
know that?” He didn’t wait for the 
mechanic’s answer. “Find Bessie’s 
serial number and description and 
give them to my secretary. If you 
find Bessie call my office. For the 
moment I’m going to assmne the car 
is stolen.” 

The mechanic turned and ran 
toward an office. Jesus Pietro used 
his handphone to issue instructions 
regarding a possible stolen car. 

Jansen came back on the line. 
“One rebel dead, sir. That leaves five 
missing.” He listed them. 

“All right. It’s beginning to look 
like they took a car. See if the wall 
guards saw one leaving.” 

“They’d have reported it, sir.” 
“I’m not ^o certain. Find out.” 
“Sir, the carport was attacked. 
The guards had to report five prison- 


130 


IP 



ers stealing an aircar during a mob 
attack!” 

”Jansen, 1 think they mig|ht have 
forgotten to. You understand me?** 
There was steel in his voice. Jansen 
signed oft without further protest. - 

Jesus Pietro looked up at the sky, 
rubbing his mustache with two fin- 
gers. A stolen car would be easy to 
find. There were no crew pleasure 
cars aboard now, not in the middle 
of Millard Parlette’s speech. But 
they might have landed it. And if a 
car had been stolen in full view of the 
wall guards, it had been stolen by 
ghosts. 

That would fit admirably with the 
other things which had been happen- 
ing at the Hospital. 

xvn 

G eoffrey Eustace Parlette’s house 
was different inside. The rooms 
were big and comfortable, furnished 
in soft good taste. They were in- 
numerable. Toward the back were a 
pool table, a small bowling alley, an 
auditorium and stage with pull-down 
movie screen. The kitchen was the 
size of Harry Kane’s living room. 
Matt and Laney and Lydia Hancock 
had moved through the entire house 
with stun guns at ready. They had 
found no living thing, barring the 
rugs and the no less than six house- 
cleaner nests. 

Lydia had threatened force to get 
Matt to return to the living room. 
He wanted to explore. He’d seen in- 
credible bedrooms. Hobbyists’ bed- 
rooms .... 

In a living room two stories tall, 
before a vast false fireplace whose 


stone logs showed red electrical heat 
where they touched, the five survivors 
dropped into couches. Harry Kane 
stiU moved carefully, but he seemed 
almost recovered from the stunner 
which had caught him in the Hospital. 
Hood had his voice back, but not his 
strength. 

Matt slumped in the couch. He 
wriggled, adjusting his position, and 
finally put his feet up. It was good 
to feel safe. 

‘Tiny hearts and livers,” said 
Hood. 

“Yah,” said Matt. 

“That’s impossible.” 

Harry Kane made a questioning 
noise. 

“I saw them,” said Matt. “The 
rest of it was pretty horrible, but that 
was the worst.” 

Harry Kane was sitting upright. “In 
the organ banks?” 

“Yes, dammit, in the organ banks. 
Don’t you believe me? They were in 
special tanks of their own, make- 
shift-looking, with the motors sitting 
in the water next to the organs. The 
glass -was warm.” 

“Stasis tanks aren’t warm,” said 
Hood. 

“And Implementation doesn’t take 
children,” said Harry Kane. “If they 
did I’d know it.” 

Matt merely glared. 

“Hearts and livers,” said Harry. 
“Just tho$e? Nothing else?” 

“Nothing I noticed,” said Matt. 
“No, wait. There were a couple of 
tanks just like them. One was empty. 
One looked . polluted, I think.” 
“How long were you in there?” 
“Just long enough to get sick 
to my stomach. Mist Demons, I

wasn’t investigating anything! I was 
looking for a map!” 

“In the organ banks?” 

“Lay off,” said Laney. “Relax, 
Matt. It doesn’t matter.” 

Mrs. Hancock had gone to find 
the kitchen. She returned now, with 
a pitcher and five glasses. “Found 
this. No reason we shouldn’t mess 
up the place, is there?” 

They assured her there wasn’t, and 
she poured for them. 

Hood said, “I’m more interested in 
your alleged psychic powers. I’ve 
never read of anything like you’ve 
got. It must be something new.” 
Matt grunted. 

“I should tell you that anyone who 
believes in the so-called psi powers 
at all usually thinks he’s psychic him- 
self.” Hood’s tone was dry, profes- 
sorial. -“.We may find nothing at all.” 
“Then how did we get here?” 

“We may never know. Some new 
Implementation policy? Or maybe 
the Mist Demons love you, Matt.” 
“I thought of that, too.” 

Mrs. Hancock returned inside. 
“When you tried to sneak up to 
the Hospitd,” Hood continued, 
were spotted right away. You must 
have run through the electric eye net. 
You didn’t attempt to run?” 

“They had four spotlights on me. 
I just stood up.” 

“Then they ignored you? They let 
you walk away?” 

“That’s right. I kept looking back, 
waiting for that loudspeaker to say 
something. It never did. Then I ran.” 
“And the man who took you into 
the Hospital. Did anything happen 
just before he went insane and ran 
back to the gatehouse?” 


“Like what. What are you think- 
ing?” 

“Anything Involving light.” 

“No.” 

Hood looked disappointed. Laney 
said, “People seem to forget about 
you.” 

“Yah. It’s been like that all nay 
life, iln school the teacher wouldn’t 
call on me unless I knew the answer. 
Bullies never bothered me.” 

“I should have been so lucky,” 
said Hood. 

L aney wore the abstracted look of 
one tracing an idea. 

‘The eyes,” said Harry Kane, and 
paused for thought. He had been 
listening without comment, in the 
attitude of the Thinker, jaw on first, 
elbow on knee. “You said there was 
something strange about the guards’ 
eyes.” 

“Yah. I don’t know what. I’ve 
seen that look before, I think, but I 
can’t remember . .” 

“What about the one who finally 
shot you? Anything odd about his 
eyes?” 

“No.” 

Laney came out of her abstraction 
with a startled look. “Matt. Do you 
think Polly would have gone home 
with you?” 

“What the Mist Demons does that 
have to do with anything?” 

“Don’t get mad. Matt. I’ve got a 
reason for asking.” 

“I can’t imagine — ” 

“That’s why you called in the ex- 
perts.” 

“All right, yes, I thought she was 
going home with me.” 

“Then she suddenly walked away.” 


132 


IF 



“Yah. The bitch just — ” Matt 
swallowed the rest of it. Not until 
BOW, when he could feel his pain 
and rage and humiliation in bearable 
retrospect, did he realize how badly 
she’d stung him. “She walked away 
like she’d remembered something. 
Something more important than me, 
but not particularly important for all 
that. Laney, could it have been her 
hearing aid?” 

“The radio? No, not that early. 
' Harry, did you tell Polly anything 
by radio that you didn’t tell the 
rest of us?” 

“I told her I’d call for her speech 
at midnight, after everyone had gone 
home. They could hear it through 
the radios. Otherwise, nothing.” 

“So she had no reason to drop 
me,” said Matt. “I still don’t see why 
we have to dig into this,” 

“It’s strange,” said Hood. “It can’t 
hurt to look at anything strange in 
your young life.” 

Laney said, “Did you resent it?” 
“Damn right I did. I bate being 
left flat like that, toyed with and then 
dropped.” 

“You didn’t offend her?” 

“I don’t see how I could have. I 
didn’t get drunk till afterward.” 

“You told me it’s happened before 
like that.” 

“Every time. Every damn time, 
until you. I was virgin until Friday 
night.” Matt looked belligerently 
around him. Nobody said anything. 
“That’s why I can’t see how it helps 
to talk about it. Dammit, it isn*t un- 
usual in my young life.” 

Hood said, “It’s unusual in Pol- 
ly’s young life. Polly’s not a tease. 
Am I wrong, Laney?” 


“No. She takes her sex seriously. 
She wouldn’t make a play for some- 
one she didn’t want. I wonder . .” 
“I don’t think I was kidding my- 
self, Laney.” 

“Neither do I. You keep saying 
something was strange about the 
guards’ eyes. Was there anything 
strange about Polly’s eyes?” 

4 X7hat are you getting at?” 

▼ V“You claim every time you’re 
getting ready to lose your virginity 
to a girl, she drops you. Why? You 
aren’t ugly. You probably don’t have 
the habit of being grossly impolite; 
you weren’t with me. You l5athe often 
enough. Was there something about 
Polly’s eyes?” 

“Dammit, Laney, . Eyes.” Some- 
thing changed in Polly*s face. She 
seemed to be listening to something 
only she could hear. She certainly 
wasn*t looking at anything; her eyes 
went past him and through him, and 
they looked blind .... 

“She looked abstracted. What do 
you want me to say? She looked like 
she was thinking of something else, 
and then she walked away.” 

“Was it sudden, this loss of in- 
terest? Did she — ” 

“Laney, what do you think? I 
drove her away deliberately?” Matt 
jumped to his feet. He couldn’t take 
any more; he was wires stressed on a 
bone frame, every wire about to 
break. Nobody had ever so assaulted 
his privacy! He had never imagined 
that a woman could share his bed, 
listen in sympathy to all the agony 
of the secrets that had shaped his 
soul, and then spilled everything she 
knew into a detailed clinical round-

table discussion! He felt like one who 
has been disassembled for the or- 
gan banks, who, still aware, watches 
a host of doctors probing and prod- 
ding his separated innards with none- 
too-clean hands, hears them making 
ribald comments about his probable 
medical and social history. 

And he was about to say so, in no 
mild terms, when he saw that nobody 
was looking at him. 

Nobody was looking at him. 

Laney was staring into the arti- 
ficial fire; Hood was looking at 
Laney; Harry Kane was in his Think- 
er position. None of them were real- 
ly seeing anything; at least anything 
here in this room. They h^ an 
abstracted look. 

“One problem,” Harry Kane said 
dreamily. “How the blazes are we 
going to free the rest of us, when 
only four of us escaped?” He glanced 
around at his inattentive audience, 
then went back to contemplating his 
navel from the inside. 

Matt felt the hair stir on his head. 
Harry Kane had looked right at him, 
but he certainly hadn’t seen Matt 
Keller. And there was something very 
peculiar about his eyes. 

L ike a man in a wax museum. Matt 
bent to look into Harry Kane’s 

eyes. 

Harry jumped like he’d been shot. 
“Where the blazes did you come 
from?” He stared as if Matt had 
dropped from the ceiling. Then he 
said, “Umm . oh! You did it.” 
There wasn’t a doubt of it. Matt 
nodded. “You all suddenly lost inter- 
est in me.” 

“What about our eyes?” Hood 


seemed about to spring at him, he 
was so intense. 

“Something. I don’t know. I was 
bending down to see when — ” 
Matt shrugged. “It wore off.” 

Harry Kane used a word. 

Hood said, “Suddenly? I don’t 
remember its being sudden.” 

“What do you remember?” Matt 
asked. 

“Well, nothing, really. We were 
talking about eyes ... or was it about 
Polly? Sure, Polly. Matt, did it 
bother you to talk about it?” 

Matt growled in his throat. 

“Then that’s why you did what- 
ever you did. You didn’t want to be 
noticed.” 

“Probably.” 

Hood rubbed his hands briskly to- 
gether. “So. We know you’ve got 
something, anyway, and it’s under 
your control. Your subconscious con- 
trol. Well!” Hood became a pro- 
fessor looking around at his not-too- 
bright class. “What questions are still 
unanswered? 

“For one, what do the eyes have 
to do with anything? For another, 
why was a guard eventually able to 
shoot you and store you away? For a 
third, why would you use your abili- 
ty to drive girls away?” 

“Mist Demons, Hood! There’s no 
conceivable reason — ” 

“Keller.” 

The voice was a quiet command. 
Harry Kane was back in Thinker po- 
sition on the couch, staring off into 
space. “You said Polly looked ab- 
stracted. Did we look abstracted a 
moment ago?” 

“When you forgot about me? 
Yah.” 


134 


IF 



“Do I look at all abstracted now?” 
“Yah. Wait a minute.” Matt stood 
up and walked aroimd Harry, examin- 
ing him from different sides. He 
should have looked like a man deep 
in thought. Thinker position, chin on 
fist on elbow on knee; face lowered, 
almost scowling; motionless; eyes 
hooded . Hooded? But clearly 
visible. 

“No, you don’t. There’s something 
wrong.” 

“What?” 

“Your eyes.” 

“Roimd and round we go,” Harry 
said disgustedly. “Well, get down and 
look at my eyes, for the Mist Demons’ 
sake!” 

Matt knelt on the indoor grass 
and looked up into Harry’s eyes. No 
inspiration came. A wrongness there; 
but where? He thought of Polly on 
Friday night, when they stood im- 
mersed in noise and elbows and talk- 
ed nose to nose. They’d touched 
from time to time, half-accidentally, 
hands and shoulders brushing . 
he’d felt the warm blood beating in 
his neck . and suddenly — 

“Too big,” said Matt. “Your 
pupils are too big. When somebody 
really isn’t interested in what’s going 
on around him, the pupils are 
smaller.” 

“What about Polly’s eyes?” Hood 
probed. “Distended or contracted?” 
“Contracted. Very small. And so 
were the guards’ eyes, the ones who 
came for me this morning.” He re- 
membered how surprised they’d been 
when he yanked on the handcuffs, 
the handcuffs which still dangled 
from his wrists. They hadn’t been in- 
terested in him; they’d merely un- 


locked the chains from their own 
wrists. And when they looked at 
him .... “That’s it. That’s why their 
eyes looked so funny. The pupils were 
pinpoints.” 

H ood sighed in relief. “Then that’s 
all of it,” he said, and got up. 
“Well, I thi^ I’ll see how Lydia’s 
doing with dinner.” 

“Come back here.” Harry Kane’s 
voice was low and murderous. Hood 
burst out laughing. 

“Stop that cackling,” said Harry 
Kane. “Whatever Keller’s got, we 
need it. Talk!” 

Whatever Keller^s got, we need it 
. Matt felt he ought to protest. 
He didn’t intend to be used by the 
Sons of Earth. But he couldn’t in- 
terrupt now. 

“It’s a very limited form of tele- 
pathy,” said Jay Hood. “And because 
it is so very limited, it’s probably 
more dependable than more general 
forms. Its target is so much less 
ambiguous.” He smiled. “We really 
ought to have a new name for it. 
Telepathy doesn’t apply, not quite.” 
Three people waited patiently but 
implacably. 

“Matt’s mind,” said Hood, “is cap- 
able of controlling the nerves and 
muscles which dilate and contract 
the iris of another man’s eye.” 

And he smiled, waiting for their 
response. 

“So what?” asked Harry Kane. 
“What good is that?” 

“You don’t understand? No, I sup- 
pose you don’t. It’s more in my field. 
Do you know anything about moti- 
vational research?” 

Three heads waggled No. 


SLOWBOAT CARGO

“The science was banned on Earth 
long, long ago, because its results 
were being used for immoral adver- 
tising purposes. But they found out 
some interesting things first. One 
of them involved dilation and con- 
traction of the pupil of the eye. 

“It turns out that if you show a 
man something and measure his 
pupil with a camera, you can tell 
whether it interests him. You 
can show him pictures of his coun- 
try’s political leaders, in places where 
there are two or more factions, and 
his eyes will dilate for the leader of 
his own. Take hkn aside for an 
hour and talk to him, persuade him 
to change his political views, and his 
pupils will dilate for the other guy. 
Show him pictures of pretty girls, and 
the girl he calls prettiest will have 
dilated pupils. He doesn’t know it. He 
only knows she looks interested. In 
him. 

“I wonder,” said Hood, smiling 
dreamily at himself. Some people 
love to lecture. Hood was one. “Could 
that be the reason the most expen- 
sive restaurants are always dark? A 
couple comes in, they look at each 
other across a dinner table, and they 
both look interested^. What do you 
think?” 

Harry Kane said, “I think you’d 
better finish telling us about Keller.” 

“He has,” said Laney. “Don’t you 
see? Matt’s afraid of being seen by 
someone. So he reaches out with 
his mind and contracts the man’s 
pupils whenever he looks at Matt. 
Naturally the man can’t get interested 
in Matt.” 

“Exactly.” Hood beamed at Laney. 
“Matt takes a reflex and works it in 


reverse to make it a conditioned re- 
flex. I knew light had something to 
do with it. You see. Matt? It can’t 
work unless your victim sees you. If 
he hears you, or if he gets a blip 
when you cross an electric-eye 
beam — ” 

“Or if I’m not concentrating on 
being scared. That’s why the guard 
shot me.” 

“I still don’t see how it’s possible,”^ 
said Laney. “I helped you do your 
research on this. Jay. Telepathy is 
reading minds. It operates on the 
brain, doesn’t it?” 

“We don’t know. But the optic 
nerve is brain tissue, not ordinary 
nerve tissue.” 

Harry Kahe stood up and stretched. 
“That doesn’t matter. It’s better than 
anything the Sons of Earth have put 
together. It’s like a cloak of in- 
visibility. Now we have to figure out 
how to use it.” 

XVIII 

T he missing car was still missing. 

It was nowhere in the Imple- 
mentation garages; it had not been 
found by the search squad, neither in 
the air nor on the ground. If a 
policeman had taken it out for legiti- 
mate purposes, it would have been 
visible; if it had not been visible, it 
would have been in trouble of some 
kind, and the pilot would have phoned 
a Mayday. Apparently it really had 
been stolen. 

To Jesus Pietro, it was disturbing. 
A stolen car was one thing; an im- 
possible stolen car was another. 

He had associated Keller with 
miracles: with the miracle that had 


136 


IF 



left him unhurt when his car fell into 
the void, with the miracle which had 
affected Hobart’s memory last night. 
On that assumption he had sounded 
the Prisoners Loose. And, Lo! there 
were prisoners r unni ng amok. 

He had associated missing prison- 
ers with a missing car with the mira- 
cles of Keller. Thus he had assumed 
a stolen car where no car could have 
been stolen. And, Lo! a car had in- 
deed been stolen. 

Then Major Jansen had called from 
the vivarium. Nobody had noticed, 
until now, that the sleeper helmets . 
were still running. How, then, had 
ninety-eight prisoners walked away? 

Miracles! What the blazes was he 
fighting? One man, or many? Had 
Keller been passenger or driver of 
that car? Had there been other pas- 
sengers? Had the Sons of Earth dis- 
covered something new, or was it 
Keller alone? 

That was an evil thought. Mat- 
thew Keller, come back from the 
void in the person of his nephew, to 
haunt his murderer .... Jesus Pietro 
snorted. 

He’d doubled the guard at the 
Alpha-Beta bridge. Knowing that the 
bridge was the only way off the cliff 
and across the Long Fall River at 
the bottom, he had nonetheless set 
guards along the cliff edge. No 
normal colonist could leave Alpha 
Plateau without a car. (But could 
something abnormal walk unseen past 
the guards?) 

And no fugitive would leave in a 
police car. Jesus Pietro had ordered 
all police cars to fly in pairs for the 
duration. The fugitives would be fly- 
ing alone. 


As part colonist Jesus Pietro had 
not been allowed to hear Millard 
Parlette’s speech; but he knew it was 
over. Crew cars were flying again. 
If the fugitives stole a crew car 
they might have a chance. But the 
Hospital would be informed imme- 
diately if a crew car were stolen. 
(ReaDy? A police car had been 
stolen, and he’d had to find out for 
himself.) 

Nobody and nothing had been 
found in the abandoned coral houses. 
(But would anything important have 
been seen?) 

Most of the escaped prisoners were 
safe in the vivarium. (From which 
they had escaped before, without 
bothering to turn off their sleeper 
helmets.) 

Jesus Pietro wasn’t used to dealing 
with ghosts. 

It would require brand new techni- 
ques. 

Grimly he set out to evolve them. 

T he arguments began during din- 
ner. 

Dinner took place at the uncon- 
ventional hour of three o’clock. It 
was good, very good. Lydia Hancock 
still looked like a sour old harridan, 
but to Matt anyone who could cook 
like her deserved the benefit of the 
doubt. They had finished the mutton 
chops when Harry Kane turned to 
business. 

“There are five of us left,” he said. 
“What can we do to get the rest of 
us loose?” 

“We could blow the pumping sta- 
tion,” Hood suggested. It developed 
that the pumping station at the base 
of the Alpha-Beta cliff, which sup- 


SLOWBOAT CARGO 


137 



plied Alpha Plateau with water fr»m 
the Long Fall, was the crew’s only 
source of water. The Sons of Earth 
had long ago planted mines to blow 
it apart. “It’d give us a diversion.” 

“And cut off the power too,” said 
Matt, remembering that hydrogen for 
fusion can be taken from water. 

“Oh, no. The power plants only 
use a few bucketfuls of water in a 
year, Keller. A diversion for what. 
Jay? Any suggestions?” 

“Matt. He got us out once. He 
can do it again, now that he 
knows. — ” 

“Oh, no you don’t I am not a 
revolutionary. I told you why I went 
to the Hospital, and I won’t go there 
again.” 

Thus, the arguments. 

On Matt’s side there was little said. 
He wasn’t going back to the Hospital. 
If he could, he would return to Gam- 
ma and live out his life there, trusting 
his psi power to protect him. If he 
had to live elsewhere — even if he 
had to spend the rest of his life in 
hiding on Alpha Plateau — so be it. 
His life might be disrupted now, 
but it was not worthless enough to 
throw away. 

He got no sympathy from anyone, 
not even from Laney. On their part 
the arguments rang^ from appeals 
to his patriotism or to his love of 
admiration, to attacks on his person- 
ality, to threats of bodily harm to 
himself and his family. Jay Hood was 
the most vituperative. You would 
have thought he had invented “the 
luck of Matt Keller”, that Matt had 
stolen it. He seemed genuinely con- 
vinced that he held a patent on psi 
power on the Plateau. 


In a way it was ludicrous. They 
begged him, they browbeat him, they 
threatened him; and with never a 
chance of succeeding. Once they 
actually succeeded in frightening him, 
and once their personal comments an- 
noyed him beyond the limits of pati- 
ence. Both times the arguments ended 
abruptly, and Matt was left alone in 
his irritation while the Sons of Earth 
discussed whatever came to mind, 
their pupils contracting to pinpoints 
whenever they looked at him. 

After the second such episode 
Harry Kane realized what was hap- 
pening and ordered the others to lay 
off. It was interfering with their abili- 
ty to make plans, he said. 

“Go somewhere else,” he told 
Matt. “If you’re not going to help us, 
at least don’t listen to our plans. 
Feeble though they’ll probably be, 
there’s no reason we should risk your 
hearing them. You might use the in- 
formation to buy your way back into 
Castro’s good graces.” 

“You’re an ungrateful son of a 
bitch,” said Matt, “and I demand an 
apology.” 

“Okay, I apologize. Now go som^ 
where else.” 

att went out into the garden. 
The mist was back, but it was 
an overhanging mist now, turning 
the sky steel gray, bleaching colors 
out of the garden, turning the void 
from a fuzzy flat plain into a dome 
around the universe. Matt found a 
stone bench and sat down and put 
his head in his hands. 

He was shaking. A mass verbal 
attack can do that to a man, can 
smash his self-respect and set up 



138 


IF 



doubts which remain for hours or 
days or forever. There are well de- 
veloped verbal techniques for many 
to use against one. You never let 
the victim speak without interrup- 
tion; never let him finish a sentence. 
You interrupt each other so that he 
can’t quite catch the drift of your 
arguments, and then he can’t find the 
flaws. He forgets his rebuttal points 
because he’s not allowed to put them 
into words. His only defense is to 
walk out. If, instead, you throw him 
out ... 

Gradually his confusion gave way 
to a kind of sick, curled anger. The 
ungrateful — ! He’d saved *their 
worthless lives twice, and where was 
their thanks? Well, he didn’t need 
them. He’d never needed them for a 
moment. 

He knew what he was now. Hood 
had given him that much. He knew, 
and he could take advantage of it. 

He could become the world’s first 
invulnerable thief. If Implementation 
would not let him resume his mining 
career, he would do just that. 
Weaponless, he could rob storehouses 
in broad daylight. He could pass 
guarded bridges unnoticed, be at work 
on Gamma while they were search- 
ing him out in every corner of Eta. 
Eta, now ... a nice place to rob, 
if he couldn’t return to his old life. 
The crew gambling resort must see 
half the wealth of Plateau at one 
time or another. 

He’d have a long walk to the 
Alpha-Beta bridge, and a longer walk 
afterward. A car would be useful. 
Serve the Sons of Earth right if he 
took their car . but he’d have to 
wait till midnight. Did he want to? 


His daydreams had calmed him 
still further. His shaking had stopped, 
and he wasn’t as angry now. Now he 
could begin to see what had moved 
the four inside to attack him so; 
though he saw no justice in it, for 
there was none. Laney, Hood, Hany 
Kane, Lydia . they must be fana- 
tics, or why would they sell thek 
lives for a hopeless revolution? Be- 
ing fanatics they would have onl^ 
one ethic: to do anything in thetr 
power to advance their cause, no 
matter whom it might hurt. 

He still didn’t know where he went 
from here. One thing he knew: it 
would not involve the Sons of Earth. 
Otherwise he had plenty of time for 
decisions. 

A chill, thin breeze blew from the 
north. Gradually the fog was thick- 
ening. 

The electric fire inside would be 
welcome. 

But the thick hostility would not. 
He stayed where he was, hunching 
his back to the wind. 

Why in blazes would Hood assume 
he drove away women? Did Hood 
think he was crazy? Or deficient? 
No; he’d have used that during the 
arguments. Why, then? 

He hadn’t driven away Laney. 

That memory warmed him. She 
was lost for good now; their paths 
would diverge, and someday she’d end 
in the organ banks. But Friday night 
had happened; Friday night was per- 
manent .... 

Polly’s eyes. Her pupils had con- 
tracted, sure enough. Like the gate- 
keeper’s eyes, like Harry’s and Hood’s 
and Laney’s eyes when Matt had tired 
of their verbal onslaughts. Why? 


SLOWBOAT CARGO 


13P 



Matt nibbled gently at his lower 
lip. 

And if he’d driven Polly away 
(never mind why; there was no 
answer) then it was not her fault 
that she had gone. 

But Laney had stayed. 

Matt jumped to his feet. They’d 
have to tell him. He had a lever on 
them: they couldn’t know how sure 
he was that he’d have nothing to 
do with their cause. And he had to 
know .... 

He turned toward the house and 
saw the cars. 

Three of them, way up there in the 
gray sky, disappearing and reappear- 
ing behind the mist. Dropping. 

XK 

H e stood perfectly still. He wasn’t 
really convinced that they were 
landing here, though they grew big- 
ger and closer every second. 

Finally they were just overhead and 
settling. And still he stood; for by 
then there was no place to run to, 
and he knew that only “the luck of 
Matt Keller” could protect him. It 
should work. He was certainly scared 
enough. 

One of the cars almost landed on 
him. He was invisible, all right. 

A tall, spare man got out of the 
car, moved his hands briefly inside 
the dashboard, stepped back to avoid 
the wind as the car rose again and 
settled on the roof. The other cars 
had landed, and they were Imple- 
mentation. A man di^mbarked and 
moved toward the tall civilian. They 
spoke briefly. The tall man’s voice 
was high, almost squeaky, nod it had 


the crew lilt. He was thanking the 
policeman for his escort. The police- 
man got back in the car, and both 
Implementation cars rose into the fog. 

The tall man sighed and let him- 
self slump. Matt’s fear ebbed. This 
crew was no danger; he was a tired 
old man, worn out with years and 
with some recent toil. But what a 
fool Harry Kane had been, to think 
nobody would come! 

The man moved toward the house. 
Tired he might have been, but he 
walked straight, like a policeman on 
parade. Matt cursed softly and moved 
in behind him. 

When the oldster saw the living 
room he’d know someone had been 
here. He’d call for help unless Matt 
stopped him. 

The old man open the big 
wooden door and walked in. Matt 
was right behind him. 

He saw the old man go rigid. 

The ancient didn’t try to scream. 
If he had a handphone he didn’t 
reach for it. His head turned from 
side to side, studying the living room 
from where he stood, taking in the 
abandoned glasses and pitcher and 
the glowing false fire. When his pro- 
file turned to Matt he looked thought- 
ful. Not frightened, not angry. 

And when the old man smiled, it 
was a slow, tense smile, the smile 
of a chess player who sees victory 
almost within Us grasp ... or de- 
feat, for his opponent might have 
set an unsuspected trap. The old man 
smiled, but the muscles of his face 
stood out iron-hard under the loose, 
wrinkled skin, and his fists tightened 
at his sides. He cocked his head to 
one side, listening. 


140 


IF 



He turned abruptly toward the 
dining room, and was face to face 
with Matt. 

Matt said, “What are you grinning 
at?” 

T he crew batted an eyelash; he 
was discomposed for just that 
long. Speaking low, he asked, “Are 
you one of the Sons of Earth?” 
Matt shook his head. 
Consternation! And why that re- 
action? Matt held up a hand. “Don’t 
do anything rash,” he said. He’d 
wrapped a handcuff chain around that 
hand to make it a better weapon. 
The old man settled back on his 
heels. Three of him would have been 
no physical match for Matt. 

“Tm going to search you,” said 
Matt. “Raise your hands.” He 
moved behind the old man and ran 
his hands over various pockets. He 
found some bulky objects, but no 
handphone. 

He stood back, considering. He 
had never searched anyone; there 
might be tricks a man could use to 
fool him. 

“What do you want with the Sons 
of Earth?” 

“I’ll tell them when I see them.” 
The baritone lilt was not hard to un- 
derstand, though Matt could never 
have imitated it. 

“That won’t do.” 

“Something very important has 
happened.” The old man seemed to 
make a difficult decision. “I want to 
tell them about the ramrobot.” 

“All right. Go ahead of me. That 
way.” 

They moved toward the dining 
room with Matt trailing. 


Matt was about to yell when the 
door suddenly opened. Lydia Han- 
cock had her nose and a sonic show- 
ing around the edge. It took her a 
second to realize that the man in the 
lead was not Matt; and then she fired. 

Matt caught the old man as he 
fell. “Stupid,” he said. “He wanted 
to talk to you.” 

“He can talk to us when he wakes 
up,” said Lydia. 

Harry Kane emerged warily, hold- 
ing the other stolen sonic ready in 
his hand. “Any others?” 

“Just him. He had a police escort, 
but they left. Better search him, there 
might be a radio on him somewhere.” 

“Mist Demons! It’s Millard Par- 
lette!” 

“Oh!” Matt knew the name, but 
he hadn’t recognized the man. “I 
think he really wanted to see you. 
When he realized someone was here, 
he acted sneaky. He didn’t panic un- 
til I told him I wasn’t one of you. 
He said he wanted to talk about the 
ramrobot.” 

Harry Kane grunted. “He won’t 
wake up for hours. Lydia, you’re on 
guard duty. I’m going for a shower; 
I’ll relieve you when I come down.” 

He went upstairs. Lydia and Hood 
picked up Millard Parlette, moved 
him into the front , entrance and sat 
him up against a wall. The old man 
had gone loose, like a puppet without 
strings. 

“A shower sounds wonderful,” 
said Laney. 

Matt said, “May I talk to you 
first? Hood too.” 

They got Jay Hood and went into 
the living room. Hood and Laney 
flopped in front of the fire, but Matt

141 



was too restless to sit. “Hood, I’ve 
got to know. What makes you think 
I’ve been using my psi power to 
drive away women?” 

“You’ll recall it was Laney’s idea 
first. But the evidence seems good. 
Do you doubt that Polly left be- 
cause you contracted her irises?” 

Of course he doubted it. But he 
couldn’t back it up. He looked at 
Laney, waiting. 

“It’s important, isn’t it. Matt?” 
“Yah.” 

“You remember, just before the 
raid, when you asked me if everyone 
was as nervous as you were.” 

“Mmm . Yah, I remember. You 
said not that nervous, but still nerv- 
ous.” 

“What are you two talking about?” 
“Jay, do you remember your first 
— mmm. Do you remember when 
you stopped being a virgin?” 

Hood threw back his head and 
laughed. “What a question, Laney! 
Nobody ever forgets the first time! 
It was — ” 

“Right. Were you nervous?” 

Hood sobered. “At one point, I 
was. There was so much I didn’t, 
know. I was afraid I’d make a fool of ‘ 
myself.” 

Laney nodded. “I’ll bet everyone’s 
nervous the first time. Including you. 
Matt. You suddenly realize This Is 
It, and you get all tensed up. Then 
your girl’s eyes go funny.” 

M att said a bad word. This was 
exactly what he hadn’t wanted 
to hear. “But what about us? Laney, 
why didn’t I defend myself against 
you?” 

“I don’t know.” 


Hood snapped, **What difference 
does it make? Whatever yoifve got, 
you’re not going to use it”* 

“I have to knowl” 

Hood shrugged and went to stand 
before the fire. 

“You were pretty Joshed,” said 
Laney. “Could that have had any- 
thing to do with it?” 

“Maybe.” 

She couldn’t have known why it 
was important, but she was trying to 
help. “Maybe it’s because Fm older 
than you. Maybe you decided I knew 
what I was doing.” 

“I didn’t decide anything. I was 
too drunk. And too bitter.” 

She turned restlessly, her wrinkled 
party dress swirling out around her. 
She stopped. “Matt! I remember! It 
was pitch dark in there!” 

Matt closed his eyes. Why, so it 
was. He’d stumbled unseeing across 
the bed; he’d had to turn on a light 
to see Laney at all . “That’s it. 
I didn’t even realize what was going 
on until the door was closed. 
Oookay,” he sighed, letting all his 
breath rush out with the word. 

Hood said, “That’s great. Are you 
finished with us?” 

“Yah.” 

Hood left without looking back. 
Laney, on the verge of leaving, hesi- 
tated. Matt looked half dead, as if 
every erg of energy had been drained 
out of him. 

She touched his arm. “What’s 
wrong. Matt?” 

“I drove her away! It wasn’t her 
fault!” 

“Polly?” She grinned into his eyes. 
“Why let it bother you? You got 
me the same night!”

“Is it my fault that I was glad? 
She dropped me like a sick house- 
cleaner, and an hour later Implemen- 
tation took her away! And when I 
found out, I was glad! I had revenge!” 
His hands were on her upper arms, 
squeezing, almost hard enough to 
hurt. 

“It wasn’t your fault,” she re- 
peated. “You’d have saved her if you 
could.” 

“Sure.” But he wasn’t hearing her. 
He let go of her arms. “I’ve got to go 
after her,” he muttered, saying the 
words aloud, trying to taste of them. 
“Yah. I’ve got to go after her.” 

He turned and made for the en- 
trance.

door. “Huh? Isn’t this what you

“Come back here! How are you

Matt turned back. He felt feverish, 
unable to think, “Castro’d be ready

know what happened last night, but 
he must know something's wrong.”

get over? Oh, damn, danm, danm!” 
“You’re tired. Why not wait ’til 
Harry comes down? Then we can get 
things organized.” 

“Oh, no. I’m not taking help from 
the Sons of Earth. This has nothing 
to do with them.” 

“How about me? Will you take my 
help?” 

“Sure, Laney.” 

She decided not to question the 
illogic of this. “All right, let’s start 
at the beginning. How are you going 
to reach the Hospital?” 

“Yah. Too far to walk. Mmm . 
Parlette’s car. It’s on the roof.” 

“But if Castro gets it it’ll lead 
him straight here.” 

“I’d have to wait ’til midnight to 
get the other car.” 

“That may be the only way.” 
Laney wasn’t tired; she’d had twice 
as much sleep as she needed in the 
vivarium. But she felt used, ready 
for the laundry. A hot bath would 
help .... She put it out of her 
mind. “Maybe we can raid a crew 
house for another car. Then we set 
the autopilot to take Parlette’s car 
back here.” 

“That’ll take time.” 

“We’ll have to take it. We’ll also 
have to wait ’til after sunset.” 

“Will we need darkness that early?” 
“It would help. And suppose the 
fog cleared while we were over the 
^oid?” 

“Oh.” Colonist and crew alike, the 
people of Plateau loved to watch the 
sun setting over the void mist. The 
colors were never the same twice. 
Land along the void edge always 
cost three times as much as land 
anywhere else. 


SLOWBOAT CARGO

“Suddenly we’d have a thousand 
crew looking down at us. It might be 
a mistake to use the void all. Castro 
may have thought of that We’ll be 
safe if the fog holds. But whatever 
we do, we’ll have to wait *til dark.” 
Matt stood up and stretched mus- 
cles which felt knotted. “Okay. So 
we get to the Hospital. How do we 
get in? Laney, what’s an electric 
eye?” 

She told him. 

“Oh. I didn’t see any light. Ultra- 
violet, of course, or infrared. I should 
be able to get over that.” 

“We.” 

“You’re not invisible, Laney.” 

“I am if I stick close to you.” 
“Phut.” 

“I’ll have to come that far with 
you anyway. You can’t program an 
autopilot.” 

Matt got up to pace. “Leave that 
a moment. How do we get over the 
waU?” 

“I don’t,” said Laney, and stopped. 
“There may be a way,” she said. 
“Leave it to me.” 

‘Tell me.” 

“I can’t.” 

The cold breeze outside had be- 
come a wind, audible through the 
walls. Laney shivered, though the elec- 
tric fire was hot enough. The fog be- 
yond the south windows was growing 
dark. 

“We’ll need guns,” she said. 

“I don’t want to take one of yours." 
You’ve only got the two we picked 
upon the way to the car.” 

“Matt, I Imow more than you do 
about crew. They all go in for sports 
of one kind or another.” 

“So?” 


“Some of them hunt A long time 
ago Earth sent us some frozen fer- 
tilized deer and caribou ova in a 
cargo ramrobot. The Hospital hatch- 
ed them out grew ’em to adulthood 
and scattered them around the bot- 
tom edge of the glacier, north of 
here. There’s enough grass there to 
keep them happy.” 

“Then we might find guns here,” 
“It’s a good bet The richer a crew 
is, the more sports equipment he 
buys. Even if he never uses it.” 

The gun rack was in a room in 
the upper story, a room lined with 
paintings of more or less wild ani- 
mals and with heads an hooves of 
deer and caribou. The rack held a 
dozen air-powered rifles. They search- 
ed the room, and eventually Laney 
found a drawer containing several 
boxes of crystal slivers, each sliver 
two inches long. 

“They look like they’d stop a 
bandersnatch,” said Matt He’d never 
seen a bandersnatch, except in film- 
ed maser messages from Jinx, but he 
knew they were big. 

“They’ll stop an elk cold. But the 
guns o^y fire one at a time. You 
have to be accurate.” 

“Makes it more sporting?” 

“I guess so.” 

Implementation mercy guns fired 
a steady stream of tiny slivers. One 
would make the victim woozy; it 
took half a dozen to drop him in his 
tracks. 

Matt closed and pocketed the box 
of oversized mercy slivers. “Getting 
hit with one of these would be like 
being stabbed with an ice pick, even 
without the knockout effect. Will they 
kill a man?”

*1 don’t know/* said Laney: She 
chose two 2:11ns from the rack. **We*ll

(4 Jay!” 

«| Hood stopped halfway to the 
living room, turned and made for the 
entrance hall. “Yes, Lydia.” 

Lydia Hancock was bending over 
Millard Parlette. She had folded his 
flaccid hands neatly in his lap. “Come 
here and have a look at this.” 

Hood looked down at the stunned 
crew. Millard Parlette was coming 
around. His eyes didn’t track and 
wouldn’t focus, but they were open. 
Hood saw something else, and he bent 
for a closer look. 

The crew’s hands didn’t match. 
The skin of one was mottled with age. 
It couldn’t be as old as Parlette 
must be, but he hadn’t replaced the 
skin in a good long time. From fin- 
gertips to elbow the arm showed a 
curious lack of personality, of what 
Hood finally decided was artistic con- 
tinuity. Part of that might have been 
imagination. Hood knew in advance 
that Parlette must have used the or- 
gan banks continuously during his 
lifetime. But no imagination was 
needed to see that the left hand was 
dry and mottled and faintly callussed, 
with cracked fingernails and receding 
quick. 

Whereas the skin of the right hand 
was like a baby’s, smooth and pink, 
untanned, almost translucent. The 
quick of the fingernails ran all the 
way to the tips of the fingers. Many 
high school students could not have 
said the same. 

“The old love-child just got a trans- 
plant job,” said Hood. 


“N«. Look here.” Lydia pointed 
to the wrist. There was a ragg^ band 
of color, something less than an inch 
wide, running round Parlette’s wrist. 
It was a dead, milky white such as 
Hood had never seen in human skin. 

“Here too.” A sinodlar ring circled 
the first joint of Parlette’s thumb. 
The thumbnail was cracked and dry, 
with a badly receding quick. 

“Right, Lydia. But what is it? An 
artificial hand?” 

“With a gun inside, maybe. Or a 
radio.” 

“Not a radio. They’d be all over us 
by now.” Hood took Parlette’s right 
hand and rolled the joints in his fin- 
gers. He felt old bone and muscle 
under the baby skin, and joints 
which would be arthritic someday 
soon. “This a real human hand. But 
why didn’t he get the whole thing 
replaced?” 

“We’ll have to let him tell us.” 

Hood stood up. He felt clean and 
rested and well fed. If they had to 
wait for Parlette to talk, they’d picked 
a nice place to wait. 

Lydia asked, “How’s Laney doing 
with Keller?” 

“I don’t know. I’m not going to 
try to find out.” 

‘That must be tough, Jay.” Lydia 
laughed a barking laugh. “You’ve 
spent half your life trying to find 
psychic powers on Plateau. Now 
one finally shows up, and he doesn’t 
want to play with us.” 

“I’ll tell you what really bothers 
me about Matt Keller. I grew up with 
him. In school I never noticed him, 
except one time when he got me mad 
at him.” Absently he rubbed a point 
on his chest with two fingertips. “He

was right under my nose all the time. 
But I was right, wasn’t I? Psi powers 
exist, and we can use them against 
the Hospital.” 

“Can we?” 

“Laney’s persuasive. If she can’t 
talk him around, I sure can’t.” 
“You’re not pretty enough.” 

“I’m prettier than you.” 

The barking laugh rang again. 
^^Toucher 

C4T knew it,” said Laney. “It had 
A to be the basement” 

Two walls were covered with var- 
ious kinds of small tools. Tables held 
an electric drill and a bandsaw. There 
were drawers of nails, screws, 
nuts .... 

Matt said, “Parlette the Younger 
must have done a lot of building.” 
“Not necessarily. It may be just 
a hobby. Come on. Matt get your 
wrists down here. I think I see the 
saw we want.” 

Twenty minutes later he was rub- 
bing bare wrists, scratching furiously 
where he’d been unable to scratch 
before. His arms felt ten pounds 
lighter without the handcuffs. 

T he time of waiting sat heavily 
on Jesus Pietro. 

It was long past quitting time. 
From the windows of his office he 
could see the trapped forest as a 
darker blur in a darkening gray mist. 
He’d called Nadia and told her not to 
expect him home tonight. The ni^t 
shift was in charge of the Hospital, 
reinforced at Jesus Pietro’s orders 
with scores of extra guards. 

Soon he’d have to alert them for 
what he expected. Right now he was 


trying to decide what to say to them. 

He wasn’t about to impress them 
with the startling news that all of five 
prisoners were loose somewhere on 
Alpha Plateau. They would already 
have heard about the escape. They’d 
leave the mop-up job to the hunting 
squads. 

Jesus Pietro activated the inter- 
com. “Miss Lauessen, please connect 
me with all of the Hospital inter- 
coms.” 

“Will do.” She didn’t always call 
him Sir. Miss Lauessen had more 
crew blood than Jesus Pietro — she 
was nearly pure — and she had 
powerful protectors. Fortunately she 
was a pleasant person and a good 
worker, ilf she ever became a dis- 
ciplinary problem — I. 

“You’re on, sir.” 

“This is the Head,” said Jesus 
Pietro. “You all know of the man 
captured last night infiltrating the 
Hospital. He and several others es- 
caped this morning. I have informa- 
tion that he was scouting the Hos- 
pital defenses in preparation for an 
attack to take place tonight. 

“Sometime between now and dawn, 
the Sons of Earth will almost cer- 
tainly attack the Hospital. You have 
all been issued maps of the Hospital 
showing the locations of automatic 
protective devices installed today. 
Memorize them, and don’t stumble 
into any of the traps, and they can 
kill. Repeat, they can kill. 

“I think it unlikely that the rebels 
wih make any kind of frontal at- 
tack.” Unlikely, indeed! Jesus Pietro 
smiled at the understatement. “You 
should be alert for attempts to in- 
filtrate the Hospital, possibly by us-

IF 



ing our own uniforms. Keep your 
identification handy. If you see some- 
one you do not recognize, ask for his 
ident. Compare him with the photo. 
The rebels have not had time to forge 
idents. 

“One last word. Don’t be reluc- 
tant to shoot each other.” 

He signed off, waited for Miss 
Lauessen to clear the lines, then had 
her contact the Power Sections. “Cut 
off all power to the colonist regions 
of the Plateau until dawn,” he told 
them. 

The men of Power took pride in 
their work, and their work was to 
keep the power running. There were 
loud protests. “Do it,” said Jesus 
Pietro, and cut them off. 

Once again he thought longingly 
of issuing death darts to his men. But 
then they would be afraid to shoot 
each other. Worse, they’d fear their 
own weapons. Never since the Co- 
venant of Planetfall had Implemen- 
tation used deadly weapons. In any 
case the poison slivers had been stored 
so long that they’d probably lost 
their effectiveness. 

He’d raised hell with tradition to- 
night; there’d be hell to pay if noth- 
ing happened. But he knew something 
would. It wasn’t just the fact that this 
was the last chance for the rebels to 
get their prisoners out of the vivar- 
ium. It was the cold certainty in 
Jesus Pietro’s viscera. Something 
would happen. 

A vague red line divided black 
sky from black land. It faded gradual- 
ly, and suddenly the Hospital lights 
came on outside, making the night 
white. Somebody brought Jesus Pie- 
tro dinner, and he ate hurriedly and 


kept the coffeepot when the tray 
was gone. 

XXI 

44j^own there,” said Laney. 

JL^Mat nodded and pushed in the 
fan levers. They dropped toward a 
medium-sized dwelling which at first 
glance looked like a large, flat hay- 
stack. There were windows in the 
haystack, and on one side was a 
porchlike platform. Under the porch 
was an oddly curved swimming pool. 
Lights showed at the windows, and 
the swimming pool area blazed with 
light. The water itself was lit from 
underneath. There was no rooftop 
landing zone, but on the other side 
of the house were two cars. 

“I’d have picked an empty house, 
myself.” Matt was conunenting, not 
criticizing. He’d decided hours ago 
that Laney was the expert in rebellion. 

“Then what? Even if you found 
a car, where would you get the keys? 
I picked this one because most of 
them will be out in plain sight by the 
pool. There, see them? Hover the car, 
and I’ll see how many I can pick 
off.” 

They’d flown east along the void, 
flying blind in the fog, staying far 
from the edge so that even the sound 
of their fans would not carry. Final- 
ly, miles east of the Parlette mansion, 
they’d turned inland. Matt flew with 
the gun balanced beside him on the 
seat. He’d never owned anything with 
such power in it. It gave him a warm 
feeling of security and invulnerability. 

Laney was in the back seat, where 
she could fire from either window. 
Matt couldn’t tell how many people 


SLOWBOAT CARGO 


147 




were down around the swimming 
pool. But the guns had telescopic 
sights. 

There were pops like balloons ex- 
ploding. “One,” said Laney. “Two. 
Oop, here comes another .... Three, 
and out. Okay, Matt, drop her fast. 
Yeeee! Not that fast. Matt.” 

“Listen, did I get us down or 
didn’t I?” 

But she was out and running for 
the house. Matt followed more slow- 
ly. The swimming pool steamed like 
a huge bathtub. He saw two fallen 
crew near the pool and a third near 
the glass doors to the house, and he 
blushed, for they were naked. No- 
body had ever told him that crew 
threw nude swimming parties. Then 
he noticed blood pooling under a 
woman’s neck, and he stopped blush- 
ing. Clothing was trivia here. 

From the pool area the house still 
looked like a haystack, but with more 
normal solid structures showing 
through the grassy yellow sides. Inside 
it was vastly different from Geoffrey 
Eustace Parlette’s house; the walls 
were all curved, and a conical false 
fireplace occupied the center of the 
living room. But there was the same 
air of luxury. 

Matt heard a pop like a balloon 
exploding, and he ran. 

H e rounded a door jamb as he 
heard the second Pop. A man 
stood behind a polished table dialing 
a handphone. He was beginning to 
fall as Matt saw him: a brawny mid- 
dle-aged crew wearing nothing but a 
few drops of water and an expression 
of ultimate terror. He was looking 
straight at Laney. One hand pawed 

IF 





at a blood spot on his ribs. His terror 
seemed to fade as he fell» but Matt 
remembered it Being hunted was 
bad in itself, but being hunted naked 
must be far worse. Naked had always 
been synonymous with “unprotected.” 
‘Try the upstairs,” said Laney. She 
was reloading the gun. “We’U have 
to find where they changed. It you 
find a pair of pants, search the pock- 
ets for keys. Hurry, we can’t stay 
here long.” 

He came down a few minutes later 
with a bunch of keys dangling from 
his finger. “They were in the bed- 
room,” he said. 

“Good. Throw ’em away.” 

“Was that a funny?” 

“1 found these.” She too had a key 
ring. “Think it through. Those clothes 
upstairs must belong to the owner 
of the house. If we take his car. 
Implementation can trace it back here. 
It may not matter; I can’t think 
of any way they could trace us from 
here back to Parlette’s. But if we 
take a visitor’s car they can’t trace 
us anywhere. So these are the ones 
we want. You can ditch yours.” 

They went back to the pool area 
for Parlette’s car. Laney opened the 
dash and fiddled inside. “I don’t 
dare send it back,” she muttered. 
“Harry’ll have to use the other one. 
Ah .... So ni just send it ten 
miles up and tell it to head south 
forever. Okay, Matt, let’s go.” 

They found a key to fit one of the 
cars on the roof. Matt flew east and 
north, directly toward the Hospital. 

T he fog had not been abnormally 
thick on the ground, but at this 
height it was the edge of Creation. 


Matt flew for an hour before he 
saw a faint yellow blur to the left. 

“The Hospital,” Laney agreed. 
They turned. 

A faint yellow blur on the left . 
and white lights forming and clarify- 
ing all around them. 

Matt dropped the car instantly. 

They came down hard on water. 
As the car bobbed to the surface 
they dived out opposite doors. Matt 
came up gasping with the cold. The 
fans washed spray over him, and he 
turned his face to avoid it. Ducks 
quacked in panic. 

The white lights were dropping 
toward them. Matt called, “\^ere 
are we?” 

“Parlette Park, I think.” 

Matt stood up in the water, waist 
deep, holding his gun high. The car 
skidded across the duck pond, hesi- 
tated at the edge and then continued 
on until it nudged into a hedge. The 
fog was turning yellowish-gray as car 
lights dropped toward the pond. 

A thought struck him. “Laney. Got 
your gun?” 

“Yah.” 

‘Test it.” 

He heard it puff. “Good,” he said, 
and pitched his own gun away. He 
heard it splash. 

Car lights were settling all around 
them. Matt swam toward the sound of 
Laney’s shot until he bumped into 
her. He took her arm and whispered, 
“Stay close.” They waded toward 
shore. He could feel her shivering. 
The water was cold, but when they 
stood up the wind was colder. 

“What happened to your gun?” 

“I threw it away. My whole pur- 
pose in life is being scared, isn’t it? 


SLOWBOAT CARGO 


149 



Well, I can’t get scared with a gun 
in my hand.” 

They stumbled onto the grass. 
White lights surrounded them at 
ground level, faintly blurred by the 
lifting mist. Others hovered overhead, 
spotlights casting a universal glow 
over tne park. In that light men show- 
ed as running black silhouettes. A car 
settled on the water behind them, 
gently as a leaf. 

me through to the Head,” 

A said Major Chin. He rested at 
ease in the back seat of his car. The 
car sat a foot above the water on a 
small duck pond in Parlette Park, 
supported on its ground-effect air 
cushion. In such a position it was 
nearly invulnerable to attack. 

“Sir? We’ve caught a stolen 
car ... Yes sir, it must have been 
stolen, it landed the moment we flew 
over to investigate. Went down like 
a falling elevator .... It was flying 
straight toward the Hospital. I 
imagine we’re about two miles south- 
west of you. They must have aban- 
doned the car immediately after land- 
ing it on a duck pond .... Yes, sir, 
very professional. The car ran into 
a hedge and just stayed there, trying 
to butt its way through on autopilot. 
License number B-R-G-Y .... No 
sir, nobody in it, but we’ve surround- 
ed the area. They won’t get through 
. ... no sir, nobody’s seen them yet. 
They may be in the trees. But we’U 
smoke them out.” 

A puzzled expression chased itself 
across his smooth round face. “Yes, 
sir,” he said, and signed off. He 
thought about directing the search by 
beltphone, but he had no further or- 


ders to give. All around him were 
the lights of police cars. The search 
pattern was fixed. When someone 
foimd something, he’d call. 

But what had the Head meant by 
that last remark? 

“Don’t be surprised if you don’t 
find anyone.” 

His eyes narrowed. The car a de- 
coy, on autopilot? But what would 
that accomplish? 

Another car flying in above him. 
This empty car to hold his attention 
while the other got through. 

He used the beltphone. “Carson, 
you there? Lift your car. out of 
there. Up to a thousand feet. Turn 
off your lights and hover and see 
what you can pick up on infrared. 
Stay there until we call off the 
search.” 

It was some time before he found 
out how badly he’d missed the mark. 

4 4 galling Major Chin,” said Do- 
heny, hovering one hundred 
feet above Parlette Park. Controlled 
excitement tinged his voice with the 
thrill of the chase. • 

“Sir? I’ve got an infrared spot just 
leaving the pond. Could be two peo- 
ple; this fog is messing up my image 
. Western shore. They’re out now, 
moving toward where all the men 
are milling around .... You don’t? 
They’re there, I swear it ... Okay 
okay, but if they aren’t there then 
something’s wrong with my infra- 
scope — sir ... Yes, sir.” 

Annoyed but obedient, Doheny 
settled back and watched the dim 
red spot merge with the bigger spot 
that was a car motor. That tears it, 
he thought; that makes them police,

whether they happen to be real or not. 

He saw the larger infrared source 
move away, leaving behind a second 
source sm^er than a car but com- 
fortably bigger than one man. That 
jerked him alert, and he moved to 
the window to check. It was there, 
all right, and — 

He lost interest and returned to the 
intrascope. The cloverleaf-shaped 
source was still there, not moving, 
the right color to be four unconscious 
men. A man-sized source separated it- 
self from the milling mass around the 
abandoned car, moved toward the 
cloverleaf source. Seconds later there 
was pandemonium. 

XXII 

G asping, wheezing, running for 
their lives, they pelted out of 
Parlette Park and into a wide, well 
lighted village walk. Matt gripped 
Laney’s wrist as they ran, so that 
she couldn’t “forget about him” and 
wander off on her own. As they 
reached the walk Laney pulled back 
on his arm. 

“Okay. We can — relax now.” 
“How far — to the Hospital?” 
“’Bout — two miles.” 

Ahead of them the white lights of 
Implementation cars faded behind a 
lighted dome of fog as they chased 
an empty car on autopilot. A yellow 
glow touched the fading far end of 
the walk: the lights of the Hospital. 

The walk was a rectangular pattern 
of red brick, luxuriously wide, with 
great spreading chestnut trees planted 
down the middle in a pleasantly un- 
even row. Street lights along the 
sides illuminated old and individu- 


alistic houses. The chestnuts swayed 
and sang shrilly in the wind. The wind 
blew the still-thinning fog into curls 
and streamers; it cut steel-cold 
through wet clothes and wet skin to 
reach meat and marrow. 

“We’ve got to get some clothes,” 
said Matt. 

“We’ll meet someone. We’re bound 
to. It’s only nine.” 

“How could those crew stand it? 
Swimming!” 

“The water was hot. Probably they 
had a sauna bath waiting somewhere. 
I wish we did.” 

“We should have taken that car.” 

“Your power wouldn’t have hidden 
us. At night they couldn’t see your 
face in a car window. They’d have 
seen a stolen car, and they’d have 
bathed it in sonics, which is just what 
they must be doing now.” 

“And why did you insist on strip- 
ping that policeman? And having 
got the damn suit, why did you throw 
it away?” 

“For the Mist Demons’ sake, Matt! 
Will you trust me?” 

“Sorry. We could either of us use 
that coat.” 

‘It’s worth it. Now they’ll be look- 
ing for one man in an Implementa- 
tion uniform. Hey! In front of me, 
quick!” 

A square of light had appeared 
several houses down. Matt stepped 
in front of her and stooped, hands on 
knees, so she could use his shoulder 
as a gun rest. 

It had worked on four police in 
Parlette Park. It worked now. A crew 
couple appeared in the light. They 
turned and waved to their hosts, turn- 
ed again and moved down the steps.

hunching slightly against the wind. 
The closing door cut the light from 
them and left them as dim moving 
shadows. As they touched the brick 
they crossed the flat trajectories of 
two hunting slivers. 

Matt and Laney stripped them and 
left them propped against a garden 
hedge for the sun to find. 

“Thank the Mist Demons/’ said 
Matt. He was still shivering inside the 
dry clothes. 

Laney was already thinking ahead. 
“We’ll stick with the houses as far 
as we can. These houses give off a lot 
of infrared. They’ll screen us. Even 
if a car does spot us, he’U have to 
drop and question us to be sure we’re 
not crew.” 

“Good. What happens when we 
run out of houses?” 

L aney didn’t answer for a long 
time. Matt didn’t press her. Fi- 
nally she said, “Matt, there’s some- 
thing I’d better tell you.” 

Again he didn’t press her. 

“As soon as we get through the 
wall ... if we get through the wall 
. I’m going to the vivarium. You 
don’t have to come along, but I’ve 
got to go.” 

“Won’t that be the first thing they 
expect?” 

“Probably.” 

“Then we’d better not. Let’s hunt 
down Polly first. We ought to keep 
the noise down as long as possible. 
Once your Sons of Earth come 
charging out, assuming we get that 
far, those doors will drop right away. 
In fact, if we — ” At this point he 
glanced over at her and stopped. 
Laney was looking straight ahead. 


Her face was hard and masklike. So 
was her voice, deliberately hard. 

“That’s why I’m telling you now. 
I’m going to the vivarium. That’s why 
I’m here.” She seemed about to break 
off; then she went on in a rush. 
“That’s why I’m here, because the 
Sons of Earth are in there and I’m 
one of them. Not because you need 
me, but because they need me. I 
need you to get me in. Otherwise I’d 
be trj^g it alone.” 

“I see,” said Matt. He was about 
to go on, but — no, he couldn’t 
say that. He’d leave himself wide 
open to be slapped down, and in her 
mood Laney would do it. Instead he 
said, “What about Polly’s big secret?” 

“Millard Parlette knows it too. He 
seemed eager to talk. If he isn’t, Lydia 
will get it out of him anyway.” 

“So you don’t need Polly any 
more.” 

“That’s right. And if you’ve got 
the idea I’m here for love of you, 
you can forget that too. I’m not try- 
ing to be boorish. Matt, or cruel 
either. I just want you to know where 
you stand. Otherwise you’ll be count- 
ing on .me to make intelligent de- 
cisions. 

“You’re transportation. Matt. We 
need each other to get in. Once we’re 
inside I’ll go straight to the vivarium, 
and you can do whatever you have 
to to stay alive.” 

For some time they walked in 
silence, arm in arm, a crew couple 
strolling home along a distance too 
short to use a car. Other crew ap- 
peared from time to time. Mostly 
they walked quickly, bent against the 
wind, and they ignored Matt and 
Laney and each other in their hurry

to get out of the cold. Once a good 
dozen men and women, varying from 
merely high to falling-^own drunk, 
poured into the street ahead of them, 
inarched four houses down and began 
banging on the door. Matt and Laney 
watched as the door opened and the 
partygoers poured in. And suddenly 
Matt felt intensely lonely. He gripped 
Laney’s arm a little tighter, and they 
went on. 

The brick walk swung away to the 
left, and they followed it around. 
Now there were no houses on the 
right. Just trees, high and thick, 
screening the Hospital from view. 
The barren defense perimeter must 
be just the other side. 

“Now what?” 

“We foUow it,” said Laney. “I 
think we ought to go in along the 
trapped forest.” 

S he waited for him to ask why, but 
he didn’t. She told him anyway. 
“The Sons of Earth have been plan- 
ning an attack on the Hospital for 
decades. We’ve been waiting for the 
right time, and it never came. One of 
the things we planned was to go in 
along the edge of the trapped woods. 
The woods themselves are so full of 
clever widgets that the guards on that 
side probably never notice it.” 

“You hope.” 

“You bet.” 

“What do^ you know about the 
Hospital defenses??” 

“Well, you ran into most of them 
last night. A good thing you had the 
sense to stay out of the trapped woods. 
There are two electric-eye rings. You 
saw the wall; guns and spotlights all 
over it. Castro probably put extra 


men on it tonight, and we can bet 
he closed off the access road. Usual- 
ly they leave it open, but it’s easy 
enough to close the electric-eye ring 
and shut off power to the gate.” 
“And inside the wall?” 

“Guards. Matt, we’ve been assum- 
ing that all these men will be badly 
trained. The Hospital’s never been 
under direct attack. We’re out num- 
bered — ” 

“Yes, we are, aren’t we?” 

“But we’ll be dealing with guards 
who don’t really believe there’s any- 
thing to guard against.” 

“What about traps? We can’t fight 
machinery.” 

“Practically none in the Hospital 
— at least, not usually. There are 
things Castro could set up in an emer- 
gency. In the slowboats there could 
be anything; we just don’t know. But 
we won’t be going near the slow- 
boats. Then there are those damn 
vibrating doors.” 

Matt nodded, a swift vicious jerk 
of his chin. 

“Those doors surprised us all. We 
should have been warned.” 

“By who?” 

“Never you mind. Stop a sec- 
ond .... Right. This is the place. 
We go through here.” 

“Laney.” 

“Yah? There are pressure wires in 
the dirt. Step on the roots only as 
we go through.” 

“What happened Friday night?” 
She turned back to *look at his 
face, trying to read what he meant. 
She said, “I happened to think you 
needed me.” 

Matt nodded slowly. “You hap- 
pened to think right.”

“Okay. That’s what I’m here for. 
The Sons of Earth are mostly men. 
Sometimes they get horribly depress- 
ed. Always planning, never actually 
fighting, never winning when they do, 
and always wondering if they aren’t 
doing just what Implementation 
wants. They can’t even brag except 
to each other, because not all the 
colonists are in our side. Then, some- 
times, 1 can make them feel like men 
again.” 

“I think 1 need my ego boosted 
about now.” 

“What you need right now, brother, 
is a good scare. Just keep thinking 
scared and you’ll be all right. We go 
through here . .” 

“1 just thought of something.” 

“What’s that?” 

“If we’d stayed here this after- 
noon we’d have saved all this trou- 
ble.” 

. “Will you come on? And don’t 
forget to step on the roots!” 

xxm 

D arkness covered most of Mount 
Lookitthat. 

The crew never knew it. The lights 
of Alpha Plateau burned undimmed. 
Even in the houses along the Alpha- 
Beta cliff, with a view across Beta 
Plateau toward the distant, clustered 
town lights of Gamma and lota • . 
tonight that view was blanked by 
fog, and who was to know that the 
clustered lights were dark? 

In the colonist regions there was 
fear and fury, but it couldn’t touch 
Alpha Plateau. 

No real danger threatened. On 
Gamma and Iota there were no hos- 


pitals where patients might die in 
dark operating theaters. No cars 
would crash without street lights. 
Spoiling meat in butcher-shop freezers 
would cause no famine; there were 
the fruit and nut forests, the crops, 
the herds. 

But there was fear and fury. Was 
something wrong, up there where aM 
power originated? Or was it a prank, 
a punishment, an experiment . 
some deliberate act of Implementa- 
tion? 

You couldn’t travel without lights. 
Most people stayed where they were, 
wherever they were. They bedded 
down where they could; for colonists 
it was near bedtime anyway. And 
they waited for the lights to come 
back. 

T hey would give no trouble, Jesus 
Pietro thought. If danger came 
tonight, it would not come from down 
there. 

Equally certain, the Sons of Earth 
would attack, though they only num- 
bered five. Harry Kane would not 
leave most of his men to die. What- 
ever he could do, he would do it, re- 
gardless of risk. 

And Major Chin’s fugitive had es- 
caped, was loose two miles from the 
Hospital, wearing a police unifornii. 
And because he had escaped, be- 
cause he was alone, because no man 
had seen him clearly ... it had to 
be Matt Keller. 

Five dossiers to match five fugi- 
tives. Harry Kane and Jayhawk Hood, 
these were old friends, the most dan- 
gerous of the Sons of Earth. Elaine 
Mattson and Lydia Hancock and 
Matthew Keller, these he had come

to know by heart durm; the long 
hours following the break this after- 
noon. He could have recognized any 
of them a mile away, or told them 
their life stories. 

The slimmest dossier was Matt Kel- 
ler’s: two and a half skimpy pages. 
Mining engineer • • • not much of a 
family man . few love affairs . • 
no evidence he had ever joined the 
Sons of Earth. 

Jesus Pietro was worried. The 
Sons of Earth, if they got this far, 
would go straight to the vivarium 
to free their compatriots. But if 
Matthew Keller was his own 
agent . • 

If the ghost of Alpha Plateau was 
not a rebel, but a thing with its own 
unpredictable purpose .... 

Jesus Pietro worried. His last sip 
of coffee suddenly tasted horrible, and 
he pushed the cup away. He noted 
with relief that the mist seemed to 
be clearing. On his desk were a stack 
of five dossiers, and a sixth all alone, 
and a mercy-bullet gun. 

I n the lights of the Hospital the sky 
glowed pearl gray. The wall was 
a monstrous mass above them, a 
sharp black shadow cutting across the 
lighted sky. They heard regular foot- 
steps overhead. 

They’d crawled here side by side, 
close enough to get in each others* 
way. They’d broad-jumped the elec- 
tric eye barriers. Matt first, then 
Laney making her move while Matt 
stared up at the wall and willed 
nobody to see her. So far nobody 
had. 

“We could get around to the 
gate,” said Matt. 


“But if Castro’s cut off the power 
we can’t get it open. No, there’s a 
better way.” 

“Show me.” 

“We may have to risk a little ex- 
citement .... Here it is.” 

“What?” 

‘The fuse. I wasn’t sure it’d be 
here.” 

“Fuse?” 

“See, a lot of Implementation is 
pure colonist. We have to be careful 
who we approach, and we’ve lost 
good men who talked to the wrong 
person, but it paid off. I hope.” 

“Someone planted a bomb for 
you?” 

“I hope so. There are only two 
Sons of Earth in Implementation, and 
either or both of them could be ring- 
ers.” She fulpbled in the big, loose 
pockets of her] mud-spattered crewish 
finery. “Bitch didn’t carry a lighter. 
Matt?” 

“Lessee. Here.” 

She took the lighter, then spoke 
deliberately. “If they see the light 
we’re done for.” She crouched over 
the wire. 

Matt crouched over her, to shield 
the light with his body. As he did so 
he looked up. Two bumps showed on 
the straight black shadow of the wall. 
They moved. Matt started to whisper. 
Stop! Yellow light flared under him, 
and it was too late. 

The heads withdrew. 

Laney shook his arm. “Run! Along 
the wall!” He followed the pull. 

“Now flat!” He landed beside her 
on his belly. There was a tremendous 
blast. Metal bits sang around them, 
raising tiny pings against the wall. 
Something bit a piece from Matt’s 


SLOWBOAT CARGO 


155 



ear, and he slapped at it like a wasp 
sting. 

He didn’t have time to curse. Laney 
jerked him to his feet, and they ran 
back the way they had come. There 
was confused shouting on the wall, 
and Matt looked up to meet a hun- 
dred eyes looking down. Then sud- 
denly the area was bright as hell. 

“Here!” Laney dropped to her 
knees, slapped Us hand onto her 
ankle and crawled. Matt heard mercy- 
bullets spattering around his ankles 
as he went in after her. 

On the outside the hole was just 
big enough to crawl through on hands 
and knees. The bomb must have been 
a shaped charge. But the wall was 
thick, and the hole was smaller on 
the inside. They emerged on their 
bellies, with scratches. Here too was 
light, too bright, making Matt’s eyes 
water. StartHngJy, there were pits 
all in a row in the dirt along this 
side of the wall, and over the cor- 
dite stink was the smell of rich 
moist new earth. 

“Bombs,” he said wonderingly. 
Pressure bombs, set off by the ex- 
plosion, originally intended to ex- 
plode under an invader dropping from 
the top of the wall. Bombs, meant to 
kill. “I’m flattered,” he whispered. 

“Shut up!” Laney turned to glare, 
and in the lurid artificial light he 
saw her eyes change. Then she turned 
and ran. She was beyond reach be- 
fore Matt had time to react. 

Feet pounded all around them, all 
running at top speed toward the hole 
in the wall. They were surrounded! 
Amazingly, nobody tried to stop 
Laney. But he saw one jerk to a 
stop, then go pelting after her. 


And nobody tried to stop Matt. 
He was invisible enough, but he’d 
lost Laney. Without him she had 
nothing but the gun . and he 
didn’t know how to reach Polly. He 
stood there, lost.

F rowning, Harry Kane inspected 
hands which ^dn’t match. He’d 
seen transplantees before, but never 
such a patchwork man as Millard 
Parlette. 

Lydia said, “It isn’t artificial, is 
it?” 

“No. But it’s not a normal trans- 
plant job either.” 

“He should be coming around.” 
“I am,” said Millard Parlette. 
Harry started. “You can talk?” 
“Yes.” Parlette had a voice like 
a squeaky door, altered by a would- 
be-musical crew lilt, slurred by the 
effects of a sonic stunner. He spoke 
slowly, consciously enunciating. “May 
I have a glass of water?” 

“Lydia, get him some water.” 
“Here.” The stocky virago sup- 
ported the old man’s head with her 
arm and fed him the water in small 
sips. 

Harry studied the man. They’d 
propped him against a wall in the 
vestibule. He hadn’t moved since then 
and probably couldn’t; but the 
muscles of his face, which had been 
slack and rubbery, now reflected a 
personality. 

“Thank you,” he said in a stronger 
voice. “You shouldn’t have shot me, 
you know.” 

“You have things to tell us, Mr. 
Parlette.” 


,156 


IF 



“You’re Harry Kane. Yes, I have 
things to tell you. And then 1*11 
want to make a deal of sorts with 
you.” 

“I’m open to deals. What do you 
have in mind?’* 

“You’ll imderstand when I finish. 
May I start with the recent ram- 
robot package? This will be somewhat 
technical — ” 

“Lydia, get Jay.” Lydia Hancock 
quietly withdrew. “I’ll want him to 
hear anything technical. Jay is our 
genius.” 

“Jay hawk Hood? Don’t tell me 
he’s here too?” 

“You seem to know a good deal 
about us.” 

“I do. I’ve been studying the Sons 
of Earth for longer than you’ve been 
alive. Jayhawk Hood has a fine mind. 
By all means let us wait for him.” 

“You’ve been studying us, have 
you? Why?” 

“I’ll try to make that clear to 
you, Kane. It will take time. Has the 
situation on Mount Lookitthat ever 
struck you as being very artificial, 
fragile?” 

“Phut. If you’d been trying to 
change it as long as I have, you 
wouldn’t think so.” 

“Seriously, Kane. Our society de- 
pends entirely on its technology. 
Change the technology and you 
change the society. Most especially 
you change the ethics.” 

“That’s ridiculous. Ethics are eth- 
ics.” 

T he old man’s hand twitched. “Let 
me speak, Kane.” 

Harry Kane was silent. 

“Consider the cotton gin,” said 


Millard Parlette. “That invention 
made it economically feasible to 
grow cotton in quantity in the 
southern United States, but not in 
the northern states. It brought slaves 
in great numbers to one section of 
that nation while slavery died out in 
another. The result was a problem in 
racial tolerance which lasted for cen- 
turies. 

“Consider feudal armor. The 
ethics of chivalry were based on the 
fact that armor was a total defense 
against anything which wasn’t sim- 
ilarly armored. The clothyard arrow, 
and later gunpowder, ended chivalry 
and made a new ethic absolutely 
necessary. 

“Consider war as a tool of diplo- 
macy.” Millard Parlette stopped to 
gasp for breath. After a moment he 
went on. 

“It was, as you know. Then 
came poison gas, and fission bombs, 
and fission-fusion bombs, and a possi- 
ble fission-fusion-radiocobalt bomb. 
Each invention made war less and 
less useful for imposing one’s wiM, 
more and more randomly destructive, 
until nationalism itself became to® 
dangerous to be tolerated, and the 
United Nations on Earth became 
more powerful than any possible mi- 
nority alliance of nations could ever 
possibly be.” 

“Consider the settling of the Belt. 
A solely technological development, 
yet it created the wealthiest popula- 
tion in the system in a region which 
absolutely required new ethics, where 
stupidity automatically carries its own 
death penalty.” 

The old man stopped again; he was 
exhausted.

(4T’m no historian,” said Harry. 

A “But morals are morals, ^^at’s 
unethical here and now is unethical 
anywhere, any time.” 

“Kane, you’re wrong. Is it ethical 
to execute a man for theft?” 

“Of course.” 

“Did you know that there was 
once a vastly detailed science of re- 
habilitation for criminals? It was a 
branch of psychology, naturally, but 
it was by far the largest such branch. 
By the middle of century twenty-one, 
nearly two-thirds of all criminals 
coiild eventually be released as 
cured.” 

“That’s silly. Why go to all that 
trouble when the organ banks must 
have been crying for — oh. I see. No 
organ banks.” 

The old man was finally smiling, 
showing perfect new white teeth. 
Sparkling teeth and keen gray eyes: 
the real Millard Parlette showed be- 
hind the cracked, wrinkled, loose 
rubber mask of his face. 

Except that the teeth couldn’t be 
his, thought Harry. Nuts to that. “Go 
on,” he said. 

“One day a long time ago, I re- 
alized that the ethical situation on 
Mount Lookitthat was fragile. It was 
bound to change some day, and 
suddenly, what with Earth constantly 
bombarding us with new discoveries. 
I decided to be ready.” 

There were footsteps on the stairs, 
running; Lydia and Hood burst in. 

Harry Kane introduced Hood to 
Millard Parlette as if they were al- 
ready allies. Hood took his cue and 
shook hands formally, wincing inside 
himself because Parlette’s hand still 
felt like something dead. 


“Keep that hand,” said Millard 
Parlette. “Examine it.” 

“We already did.” 

“Your conclusions?” 

“Ask you about it.” 

“Apparently Earth is using biologi- 
cal engineering for medical purposes. 
There were four gifts in the ram- 
robot package, along with complete 
instructions for their care and use. 
One was a kind of fungus-virus sym- 
biot. I dipped my little finger in it. 
Now the muck is replacing my skin.” 
“Replacing — ? Sorry,” said Hood. 
It was difficult not to interrupt Par- 
lette, his speech was so irritatingly 
slow. 

“That’s, right. First it dissolves the 
epidermis, leaving only the living 
' cells beneath. Then it somehow stimu- 
lates the DNA memory in the derma. 
Probably the virus component does 
that. You may know that a virus 
does not reproduce; it compels its 
host to produce more virus, by in- 
serting its own reproductive chains in- 
to the host cells.” 

“You may have a permanent 
guest,” said Hood. 

“No. The virus dies after a short 
time. Any virus does that, 'fhen the 
fungus starves.” 

“Wonderful! The muck moves in 
a ring, leaving new skin behind!” 
Hood considered. “Earth really came 
through this time. But what happens 
when it reaches your eyes?” 

“I don’t know. But Aere were no 
special instructions. I offered myself 
as a test subject because I could use 
a new pelt. It’s even supposed to get 
rid of scar tissue. It does.” 

“That’s quite an advance,” said 
Harry. 


158 


IF 



“But you don’t see why it’s im- 
portant. Kane, 1 showed you this 
first because I happened to bring it 
along. The others will jolt you.” 
Parlette let his head droop to re- 
lieve the strain on his neck. “I don’t 
know what animal gave birth to the 
second gift, but it now resembles a 
human liver. In the proper environ- 
ment^ it will behave like a human 
liver.” 

H arry’s eyes went wide and blank. 

Lydia made a startled hissing 
sound. And Millard Parlette added, 
“The proper environment is, of 
course, the environment of a human 
liver. They have not been tested be- 
cause they are not fully grown. We 
can expect disadvantages due to the 
lack of nervous connections — ” 
“Keller told the truth. Little hearts 
and livers!” Harry exclaimed. “Par- 
lette, was the third gift an animal 
to replace the human heart?” 

“Yes. Nearly all muscle. It reacts 
to adrenalin by speeding up, but once 
again the lack of nervous — ” 

“Yee HAH!” Harry Kane began to 
dance. He grabbed Lydia Hancock, 
spun her around and around. Hood 
watched, grinning foolishly. Kane ab- 
ruptly released her and dropped to 
his knees in front of Parlette. “What’s 
the fourth?” 

“A rotifer.” 

“A . rotifer?” 

“It lives as a symbiot in the hu- 
man bloodstream. It does things the 
human body will not do for itself. 
Kane, it has often struck me that 
evolution as a process leaves some- 
thing to be desired. Evolution is 
finished with a man once he is too 


old to reproduce. Thus there is no 
genetic program to keep him alive 
longer than that. Only inertia. It 
takes enormous medical knowledge 
to compen — ” 

“What does it do, this rotifer?” 

“It fights disease. It cleans fatty 
deposits from the veins and arteries. It 
dissolves blood clots. It is too big to 
move into the small capillaries, and 
it dies on contact with air. Thus it 
will not impede necessary clotting. 
It secretes a kind of gum to patch 
weak points in the walls of the arter- 
ies and larger capillaries, which is 
very, very reassuring to a man of 
my age. 

“But it does more than that. It 
acts as a kind of catch-all gland, a 
supplementary pituitary. It tends to 
maintain the same glandular balance 
a man is supposed to have at around 
age thirty. It will not produce male 
and female hormones, and it takes its 
own good time disposing of excess 
adrenalin, but otherwise it maintains 
the balance. Or so say the instruc- 
tions.” 

Harry Kane sank back on his 
heels. “Then the organ banks a are 
done. Obsolete. No wonder you tried 
to keep it secret.” 

“Don’t be silly.” 

“What?” Parlette opened his 
mouth, but Harry rode him down. 
“I tell you the organ banks are 
done for! Listen, Parlette. The skin 
mold replaces skin grafting and does 
it better. The heart animal and the 
liver animal replace heart and liver 
transplants. And the rotifer keeps 
everything else from getting sick in 
the first place! What more do you 
want?'*

He was pacing now, in short jerky 
steps. 

You would need several hundred 
different artifacts of genetic engineer- 
ing to make the organ banks really

and Hood was silent. *“ParIette, I 
jumped the gun. You’re right. But 
rU give you something to think about. 
Suppose every colonist on Mount 
Lookitthat knew only the facts about 
the ramrobot package. Not Hood’s 
analysis, and not yours; just the truth. 
What then?” 

Parlette was smiling. He shouldn’t 
have been, but his white teeth gleam- 
ed evenly in the light, and the smile 
was not forced. “They would assume 
the organ banks were obsolete. They 
would confidently expect Implemen- 
tation to disband.” 

“And when Implementation show- 
ed no sign of disbanding, they’d , re- 
volt! Every colonist on Mount Look- 
itthat! Could the Hospital stand 
against that?** 

“You see the point, Kane. I am in- 
clined to think the Hospital could 
stand against any such attack, though 
I would not like to gamble on it. But 
I am sure we could lose half the popu- 
lation of this planet in the blood 
bath, win or lose.” 

“TTien — you’ve already thought 
of this.” 

Parlette’s face twisted. His hands 
fluttered aimlessly, and his feet jump- 
ed against the floor, as the effects of 
the sonic gave up their hold on him. 
“Do . you think me a fool, Harry 
Kane? I never made that mistake 
about you. I first heard of the ram- 
robot package six months ago, when 
the ramrobot sent out its maser mes- 
sage. I knew immediately that the 
present crew rule over the Plateau 
was doomed.”

Dear Editor: 

I notice that many of the letters 
to the editor are sent in by teen- 
agers. I don’t know if this is how it 
is all of the time or not, but I would 
imagine you have quite a number 
of young readers. I am interested in 
knowing what your goals are in pub- 
lishing this particular magazine, To 
teach, (What?) To make people 
think? (About what?) I have been 
acquainted with some science fic- 
tion in the past, but I had no idea 
there was so much ridiculous fan- 
tasy. There is such a thing as a 
perverted imagination, and I believe 
your October 67 issue (which my 
son retrieved from someone’s trash 
can) is an unqualified example. 

Someone wrote you, ‘‘Make us 
think . Teach us.” This seems to 
me to be a tremendous challenge. If 
that is your goal, perhaps you should 
reconsider whut you are teaching, 
how are you shaping, young minds 
to think? I refer specifically to a 
story entitled “Conqueror” by Eisen- 
berg. There is nothing in this story 
even remotely connected to good 
strong positive thinking — the type 
that would help a young person 
adopt worthwhile values. In fact, I 
am sure it would push him the other 
way. 

In reference to some of the other 


articles I would say that no alert 
teen-^aiger who is eager to improve 
his knowledge needs hairy monsters 
to encourage hiin to think straight 
— even about possible events; why 
waste valuable time on the impos- 
sibly fantastic? 

I find it hard to believe that any 
intelligent, educated person who is 
aware of the problems already ex- 
isting in our world today would de- 
liberately set out to weaken and de- 
moralize our youth. They happen to 
be up-coming leaders, many of them. 
Parents who are interested in bring- 
up good strong Americans are hav- 
ing a tough time of it, and you fel- 
lows are not helping by publishing 
this kind of material. Is it the money 
you need? It isn’t worth it, believe 
me. Why don’t you try to think 
of something that will help young 
people use their imaginations to face 
some of the realities of life. I don’t 
know of any true scientists or edu- 
oators who would uphold you in 
what you are printing. Of course, 
you attract a certain kind of audi- 
ence besides inexperienced teen- 
agers, and if you did change your 
format, a dozen other publishers 
would take your place. Maybe that's 
the way you look at it. You’re think- 
ing all right enough — negatively. 

In your Foundation Trilogy which

was advertised on the back cover I 
note a faint parallel of characters 
to those found in a great book en- 
titled The Holy Bible. (It has been 
said that every worthwhile thing 
known to the human race has its 
counterfeit.) However, the solution 
to the problem of the brilliant, yet 
dangerous poweivmonger spoken of 
in the Bible is an absorbing one and 
will make you think. Positively. —

some of the young minds think. Not 
quite so sure about some of the old 

ones. — Editor.

Dear Editor: 

Just finished reading To Serve 
the Masters in the September issue 
of Worlds of If maigazine. It’s hard 
to ibelieve that this is a first time 
for this author. Hope to see more 
work by Mr. Chapdelaine. SF can 
sure use some new writers. 

Please continue the fantasy type 
stories. There are not too many of 
these any more — Vance E. James,

Dear Editor: 

This is my first letter to a sci- 
ence-fiction magazine, and I’d ap- 
preciate you reading it as I think it 
contains some worthwhile comments, 
both in complimentary and critical 
forms. 

Your October issue was superb; 
better than that, it was uniquely 
original, and that’s difficult for any- 
body to say about anything in today’s 
copy-cat society. Why do I think it 
so worthy of such compliments? Be- 
cause of the short-stories Conqueror 
and Mu Panther, mainly. They were. 


in every visual and emotional sense, 
stories about real men whose rugged 
actions and keen thinking bring back 
a genuine feeling of masculinity, a 
thing sorely missed by the long- 
haired and soft-eyed generation of 
my time, of which I am a part. 

Whether you know it or not, aim- 
ing entertainment at the virile and 
imaginative male today is the very 
best kind of business, and you will 
reap the greater because of it. I sin- 
cerely hope you keep your man- 
versus-animal type format going, es- 
pecially with stories like Mu Pan- 
ther. That was exceptionally unique. 
Enough compliments, though. 

Complaints? Several, one being in 
the form of a suggestion, the other 
an outright jab at your already bur- 
sting pride. 1.) Go bi-monthly 
(please, no groans from the audi- 
ence; I meant this as a suggestion, 
not as criticism). I feel you’re prone 
to printing junk as well , as riches, 
as Septemb^’s issue will amply 
testify. Maybe this way, going bi- 
monthly, you’ll be able to print just 
the good stuff. Please think about 
it. 2.) What has already been stated, 
that of September’s lousy contents, 
and I mean all of it. If you thought 
I’d spend sixty cents on that 
#&%*c$, then you’re out of your 
gurple-itree I What a waste, and I 
am forced to swallow some choice 
but reluctant words. 

So you see, going bi-monthly isn’t 
so bad. I’m sure you’d be much bet- 
ter off . Maybe you’d lose a few sub- 
scribers which is almost certain. On 
the other hand, think of all the man/ 
animal/nuts you’d be gaining in re- 
turn — like me for instance! —
