THE WORLD OF TOMORROW 



I N New York City twenty years 
ago, a world emerging from the 
Depression took time out for fun, 
and for a glimpse of the future. 
The bad days lay behind and war 
lay ahead, but fun there was, and 
the glimpse of the future was as 
true as the war that was to come. 

Way out at the end of the sub- 
way tracks in the borough of 
Queens was a place called “The 
Astoria Dump.” It was the pit for 
all the trash of a giant metropolis. 
The Astoria Dump was perma- 
nently on fire. The Fire Depart- 
ment kept hoses going day and 
night, not to put out the fire — 
there was no hope of that — but 
to keep it from spreading. A sludgy 
creek ambled, in complete discour- 
agement, between cliffs of garbage 
as high as houses. The inhabitants 
of the Astoria Dump were gigantic 
flies and rats. 

Here was the site for the New 
York World’s Fair of 1939 - 
whose theme was “The World of 
Tomorrow.” Would it be possible 
to move the mountains of rotting 
garbage, dispossess the fierce things 
that fed on it, clear away the 
stench — and finally, when it never 
could be done before, put out the 
permanent fire — so that “The 
World of Tomorrow” could be built 
here? 



Deliberate symbolism? No — the 
fair would pay for the elimination 
of the dump. 

Fleets of earthmovers and an 
army of men with the ruthless 
weapons of peace leveled the gar- 
bage cliffs, rooted out the vermin, 
and covered all with clean earth 
through which no smell of decay 
or tongue of flame could ever 
escape. 

The Astoria Dump was no more, 
but it had to be built upon if it 
was not to be merely a buried pest 
hole. 

Landscapers moved in, and pav- 
ers, and carpenters, light engineers, 
hydraulics men — an army as huge 
and as busy as the one that had 
interred Astoria Dump — ai;d they 
turned it into “Flushing Meadows” 
and made the World of Tomorrow 
rise there. 

Beautiful? 

Yes, very beautiful — the high 
spire of the Trylon and the great 
ball of the Perisphere, the sodium- 
vapor lamps along the avenues, 
the leaping illuminated fountains 
in the Lagoon of Nations, the Fu- 
turama and Vodor, the General 
Electric building with its man- 
made lightning flying around, cap- 
tive, inside a wire-screen cage — 
truly it was the World of Tomor- 
row, just as advertised, and it was 



4 



GALAXY 



the first time that millions from the 
world of that day could take a good 
look at what the future promised 
in the way of plenty, leisure and 
joy. 

There were girlie shows on the 
Midway, barkers huckstering as 
they have done since antiquity, and 
perhaps as they will do in perpetu- 
ity, crude and garish souvenirs. 
They didn’t matter. The World’s 
Fair of 1939 was none of those 
things. 

It was the bright, wonderful 
World of Tomorrow, and all the 
braver and more wonderful for 
having been erected on the horror 
that had been Astoria Dump, and 
if people came to see the bare 
babes, they stayed to see the shin- 
ing future. 

For the future was there indeed, 
beyond the rot of dictatorship that 
had to blasted out, the human 
vermin to be destroyed, the fire of 
war extinguished. 

The World of Tomorrow is to 
return to New York City in 1964 
to the same site — Flushing Mead- 
ows, nee Astoria Dump. 

No need now to bury a night- 
mare in order to construct a dream. 
Meadows — real meadows, green 
to the eye, sweet to the nose — are 
there to hold marvels that the 
World of Tomorrow of 1939 
thought unimaginably distant, too 
far away to dare to speculate upon, 
but that are realities a scant quar- 
ter of a century later. 



The science fiction of 1939 did 
more than dare. It saw how soon 
so many of these “unimaginably 
distant” marvels would happen. 
It dared look at the war that was 
to come, and beyond the war to the 
kinds of “peace” that were all too 
likely — for the one that did come 
about was not a whit more likely 
than the others — and beyond that, 
and further still, into every aspect 
of the future that was at all dis- 
cernible, however faintly, a genera- 
tion ago. 

The marvels of the World of 
Tomorrow of 1964 are in these 
pages today, along with the actual 
world of 1964, whatever it may 
look like, for no one kind of world 
of 1964 is a certainty when science 
packs the progress of centuries into 
a single generation, and steepens 
the curve ever and ever more 
sharply, so that one week’s impos- 
sibility is next week’s fact, or one 
week’s inevitability next week’s 
couldn’t-have-happened. 

The process that science fiction 
uses is one familiar to businessmen 
and government statisticians — ex- 
trapolation, carrying forward known 
data or theory to future probability. 
The process is more than valid; it’s 
absolutely essential. But carry 
known data forward without ex- 
ploring possible factors and the re- 
sult can’t help being funny — or the 
very deadliest tragedy. Here are 
some examples of the funny and 
terribly unfunny.

When the Louisiana Purchase 
was made at the beginning of the 
19th century, the territory of the 
U.S.A. was doubled. Not till 2400 
A.D., it was estimated, could the 
new lands be tamed and settled. 
True enough — with only animal- 
drawn transportation. But along 
came the locomotive to hoot at the 
“safe” estimate. 

In a Connecticut Yankee in 
King Arthur’s Court, Mark Twain 
notes units of currency are so small 
that buckshot has real purchasing 
power, and astonishes the natives 
with the fact that a man in the 
19th century can earn as much as 
five or ten dollars a week. Present 
wages would have astonished him 
just as much, though he himself was 
using the unending trend away 
from small units of currency. 

The patent office belief at the 
end of the 19th century that every- 
thing had been discovered, and it 
was only a matter of filling in the 
decimal points, is common knowl- 
edge. What still stuns is how the 
belief could have been held when 
major breakthroughs were being 
readied in the labs right at that 
moment. 

Before World War II, Capt. 
B. H. Liddell-Hart was the leading 
Allied military theoretician. Mod- 
ern defense, he said, had become so 
powerful that the cost of over- 
whelming it would be unbearably 
prohibitive. What he neglected to 
speculate on was that a Maginot 



Line could be made entirely useless 
by one smash at one point, or that 
a country like Russia would pay 
the exorbitant price to overcome 
Finland’s strategically far better 
Mannerheim Line, or that Singa- 
pore’s defenses, all auned seaward, 
could be negated by a land attack 
from the rear, jungle or no jimgle. 
How could he have known? By 
following the published military 
thinking on both Allied and Axis 
sides. In exploring all possibilities, 
the boldest military thinking comes 
close to science fiction. In both, 
“impossible” and “inevitable” are 
meaningless words, just as they are 
to basic research — because they 
are the most costly, impractical and 
escapist ones in the language. 

It took clear vision to see past 
the horror of Astoria Dump to the 
World of Tomorrow in 1939. It 
takes clearer vision still to see past 
the horror of two hostile hemi- 
spheres to the World of Tomorrow 
of 1964. 

And beyond that? 

There are all sorts of worlds and 
all sorts of tomorrows, and only the 
extrapolative skill and daring of 
science fiction can see their fore- 
shadowings. There is threat in the 
fact that the Russians know this 
better than the Free World does — 
nothing could be more escapist 
than thinking they’ve assigned it a 
crash-priority rating for escapist 
reading.

Terra resounded to the triple toast of the 




Haldorian hordes: For Haldor! For Glory! 
And for Heaven's sake, let us out of here! 




O NCE my name was Ameet 
Ruxt, my skin was light 
blue, and I was a moder- 
ately low-ranking member of the 
Haldorian Empire. Or should I say 
I was a member of the lower in- 



come group? No, definitely “low- 
ranking,” because, in a warrior so- 
ciety, even one with as high a tech- 
nological level as a statistician sits 
low on the totem pole. He is 
handed the wrong end of the stick

someone — and turn him into a 
Fighter Basic in a third of a year. 

“Look,” I’d complained to the 
burly two-striper in the Receiving 
Center, “I’m a trained statistician 
with a degree and . .”

“Say Sir, when you address me.” 

I started over again. “I know, Sir, 
that they use statisticians in the 
service. So if Haldor needs me in 
the service it’s only sensible that 
I should work in statistics.” 

The Hweetoral looked bored, 
but I’ve found out since that all 
two-stripers looked bored; it’s be- 
cause so many of them have at- 
tained, at that rank, their life’s am- 
bition. “Sure, sure. But we just got 
a directive down on all you paper- 
pushers. Every one of you-from now 
on out is headed for Fighter Basic 
Course. You know, I envy- you, 
Ruxt. Haldor, what I wouldn’t give 
to be out there with real men again! 
Jetting down on some new planet 
— rasdng down the mongrels till 
they yelled for mercy — and grab- 
bing a new chunk of sky for the 
Empire. Haldor! That’s the life!” 
He glanced modestly down at his 
medalled chest. 

“Yes, Sir,” I said, “it sure is. But 
look at my examination records 
you have right there. Physically 
I’m only a 3 and you have to have 
a 5 to go to Basic Fighter. And 
besides,” I threw in the clincher, 
though I was a bit ashamed of it, 
“my fighting aptitude only meas- 
ures a 2!” 

The Hweetoral sneered unsubt- 
ly and grabbed a scriber with heavy 
fingers. A couple of slashes, a 
couple of new entries, and lo, I was 
now a 5 in both departments. I was 
qualified in every respect.'

“See,” he said, “that’s your first 
lesson in the Service, Ruxt. Figures 
don’t mean a thing, because they 
can always be changed. That’s 
something a figure pusher like you 
has to learn. So—” he shoved out 
that ponderous hand and crushed 
mine before I could protect myself 
—“good luck, Ruxt. I know you’ll 
get through that course — alive, I 
mean.” He chuckled heartily. “And 
I know men!” 

XTE was right. I got through alive. 

But then, 76.5 per cent of 
draftees do get through the Basic 
Fighter Course, alive. But for me 
it took a drastic rearrangement of 
philosophy. 

Me, all I’d ever wanted was a 
good life. An adequate income, art 
and music, congenial friends, an un- 
derstanding wife — just one wife 
was all I’d ever hoped for. As you 
can see, I was an untypical Haldor- 
ian on every point. 

After my first day in Basic 
Fighter Course I just wanted to 
stay alive. — 

“There’s two kinds of men we 
turn out here,” our Haldor told us 
as we lined up awkwardly for the 
first time (that scene so loved by 
vision-makers). We new draftees 
called our Trontar our Haldor be- 
cause he actually had the power 
over our bodies that the chaplains 
assured us the Heavenly Haldor 
had over our liberated spirits. Our 
Trontar looked us over with his 



GALAXY 



fatherly stare, flexing his powerful 
arm muscles so that his three tat- 
tooed stripes rippled and danced. 
“Yeah,” he went on, “two kinds of 
men : Fighting men and dead men!” 
The Trontar grinned that fighting 
Haldorian grin you see all your 
lives on the Prop Sheets. “And I’ll 
tell you something, men. When you 
leave here — all Fighters Basic — 
I’m going to envy you. Yeah, I’ll 
really envy you gutsy killers when 
you go out in that big Out-There 
and grab yourselves a new chunk 
of sky.” He paused and studied our 
faces. “Now we’re gonna run, and 
I do mean run, two full decades. 
The last four men in get to do it 
over again, and pull kitchen duty 
tonight too.” 

I tried, as others have tried, to 
slip quietly out of Basic Fighter. I 
tried being sick, but following sick 
report one found oneself doing a 
full day’s training — after the un- 
derstanding medics had shoved 
some pep pills into you. I de- 
manded a physcial examination. 
They weren’t going to push me 
around. 

After a couple of days in solitary, 
I asked in a nice way for physical 
evaluation. 

Well, I asked. I wasn’t very 
smart in those days. 

They weren’t interested in my 
story of how my records had been 
falsified or in my fighting aptitude. 

“Look, draftee,” the psycho-man 
said after I finally got to him, “the 
SUCCESS STORY 



fact that you’ve got to see me shows 
you have enough of a fighting apti- 
tude. Your Trontar didn’t encour- 
age you to request evaluation, did 
he? And he isn’t going to like you 
very much when you report back 
to your platoon, is he?” 

I shuddered. “Not exactly.” 

“Call me Sir.” 

“No, Sir. But I was desperate. 
Sir. I don’t think I can stand . .” 



66T^RAFTEE, you know that 
^ some unfortunate men 
break down in training and that 
we have to take them out. Maybe 
you’ve already lost some that way. 
Suppose you were brought in here, 
gibbering, yowling, and drooling — 
I guess we’d have to cure you and 
send you back home as non-fight- 
er material, eh?” 

Someone up here liked me! Here 
was a tip on how to escape back 
to the old quiet life. I nodded agree- 
ably. 

“But you know, don’t you,” he 
said softly, “that first we run a 
thorough test on our drooling 
draftee? Say it’s you . .” 

I nodded again. 

‘We most always detect fakers. 
And you know there’s a death pen- 
alty for any Haldorian attempting 
to escape his duty.” He smiled sad- 
ly, and reminiscently. 

I nodded. Maybe someone up 
here didn’t like me. 

“So we’d shoot you dead with 
one of those primitive projectile 



11 



weapons, as an object lesson for 
both you and thp draftees we had 
remaining.” 

I nodded and tried to show by 
my countenance how much I ap- 
proved of people being shot dead 
with primitive weapwns. 

“But suppose,” he went on, “that 
you’d really cracked up or that 
you’d faked successfully?” 

“Yes, Sir?” Hope returned, hesi- 
tantly and on tip-toes, ready to 
flee. 

“Then we’d cure you,” he said. 
“But the cure imfortunately in- 
volves the destruction of your 
higher mental faculties. And so 
there’d be nothing for it but to ship 
you off to one of the mining planets. 
That’s standard procedure, if you 
didn’t know. But I think you’ll be 
all right now, don’t you?” 

Hope fled. I assured him that I’d 
be just fine and reported back, on 
the double, to my training platoon. 

“Just in time, Ruxt,” my Trontar 
greeted me. “Back for full duty, I 
take it? That’s the Haldorian 
spirit!” He turned to the platoon 
which was lined up like three rows 
of sweaty statues. “Men, remember 
what I told you about taking cover 
when you’re under fire — and stay- 
ing under cover? Just suppose we 
suddenly came under fire — flat 
trajectory stuff — out here on this 
flat exercise ground with no cover 
except in that latrine pit over there. 
Would any of you hesitate to dive 
into that latrine pit? And once in 



there, safe and sound, would any 
of you not stay there until I gave 
the word to come out?” 

A perceptible shudder passed 
like a wave over the platoon. We 
knew the Trontar did not ask 
pointless questions. 

“Of course you wouldn’t,” he as- 
sured us, “and you’d even stay in 
there all day under this hot sun if 
you had to. Ruxt! You’re rested 
and refreshed from visiting the hos- 
pital. You demonstrate how it’s 
done.” 

It was a long day, even though 
my Trontar kindly sent some 
sandwiches over to me at high 
noon. I didn’t eat much. But I did 
do a lot of thinking. 

^ I '' HERE was one last hope. I 
wrote a letter to a remote clan 
relative who was supposed to have 
a small amount of influence. 

It was a moving letter. I told 
how my test results had been fal- 
sified, what beasts our trainers 
were, how the medics refused to 
retest me — very much the stand- 
ard letter that new Haldorian train- 
ees write. As I went out to mail 
this plea, one evening, I met two 
of my fellow trainees starting out 
on a night march in full field equip- 
ment. 

“How come?” I asked, instantly 
fearful that I’d missed some no- 
tice on the bulletin board. 

“We wrote letters,” one of them 
said simply. 



12 



GALAXY 



“The Trontar censors all our 
mail,” said the other. “Didn’t you 
you know? Oh, well, neither did 
we.” 

As they marched off, I' made a 
small bonfire out of my letter after 
first, almost, just throwing it away 

— before I remembered that the 
Hweetorals checked our waste 
cans. What a man has to do to hold 
two measly stripes! 

Acceptance of the inevitable is 
the beginning of wisdom, says the 
ancient Haldorian sage. I put in 
an application for transfer to the 
Statistical Services to be effective 
upon completion of Basic Fighter 
Course. 

“Statistical Services?” the Com- 
pany Clerk asked. “What’s that? 
Anyhow, you’re going to be a Fight- 
er Basic, if you get through this 
training,” he said darkly. The Com- 
pany Clerk was a sad victim of our 
Haldorian passion for realistic 
training; he had lacked one day of 
completing Fighter Basic when 
he’d let his leg dangle a bit too long 
after he’d scaled a wall, and the 
training gentlemen had unemo- 
tionally shot it off. As it turned out, 
our efficient surgeon/ replacers had 
been unable, for some technical 
reason, to grow back enough leg for 
full duty. So there was nothing for 
it but to use the man as could be 
best done. They’d made him a clerk 

— mainly because that was the spe- 
cialty they were shortest of at the 
time. 



“Who says you can put in for 
Statistical Services?” the Company 
Clerk demanded. 

“Reg 39-47A.” I was learning my 
way around. The night before I was 
on orderly duty in the office. I had 
tracked down the chapter and 
verse which, theoretically, allowed 
a man to change his destiny. 

“Know the Regs, do you? Start- 
ing to be a trouble-maker, huh? 
Yeah, Ruxt, I’ll put in your appli- 
cation.” 

I turned away with some feeling 
of relief. This might possibly work. 

The Company Clerk called me 
back. “You know the Regs so good, 
Ruxt,” he said. “How come you 
didn’t ask me for permission to 
leave? I’m cadre, you know.” He 
leaned back in his chair and 
grinned at me. “Just to help you 
remember the correct Haldorian 
deportment I’m putting you on 
kitchen duty for the next three 
nights. That way,” he grinned 
again, “you can divide up your five 
hours of sleep over three nights in- 
stead of crowding them all into 
one.” 

Poor deluded Company Clerk! I 
actually averaged three hours of 
sleep every one of those three 
nights — after I found out that the 
mess Trontar would accept my 
smoking ration. 

I felt that I was beginning to un- 
derstand the system, a little and 
at long last, particularly after I saw 
my co-workers in the kitchen do-

doing what should have been my 
work. 

II 

T hen we started combat train- 
ing, and then we started los- 
ing our normal 23.5 per cent. 

It wasn’t too bad as long as they 
stuck to the primitive stuff. I mean, 
you can see arrows and spears com- 
ing at you, and even if you have 
had only the five hours of sleep you 
can either duck the projectiles or 
catch them on your shield. And 
with the medics on the alert, the 
wounds are painful but seldom 
fatal. You just end up with a week’s 
hospitalization and slip back to the 
next training group. But when they 
go up to the explosively-propelled 
solids, when the Trontar .smirks 
and says: “Men, this is called a 
boomer, or a banger, or maybe 
sometimes a firestick, depending on 
what planet you’re fighting on,” 
and when he holds up a contraption 
of wood and metal with a hole at 
one end and a handle on the other 
— then. Draftee, look out! 

It takes time to learn. It isn’t 
till you associate a bang in the dis- 
tance with a perforated man beside 
you that you do learn. And when 
you finally come under fire from 
our regular production weapons 
like rays — well! 

You might wonder why they rxm 
us through the entire history of 
weapons starting with the sling and 

14 



ending with the slithers — the name 
servicemen give to those Zeta Rays 
that diverge from line of sight to 
drop in on a dug-in enemy. THie 
usual explanation is that Haldori- 
ans are still invading places where 
the natives still use such things as 
bows and arrows. But I think, my- 
self, that it’s something the Mil 
Prop guys figured out. The idea is, 
as I see it, to run you right through 
the whole course of our fighting, in- 
vading Haldorian history, and in 
that way to make a better fighter 
out of you. And you do get rid of 
the death-prones before there’s 
much time or work invested in 
them — or before their inevitable 
early death means the failure of a 
mission. Haldoria — most practical 
of Empires! 

But they didn’t make a fighter of 
me. All they did was to reinforce 
my natural survival instinct con- 
siderably, acquaint me with the 
tortuous ways of the service, and 
give me a great urge for a peaceful 
existence. But to all appearances, 
as I stood in the orderly room after 
graduation, I was the ideal poster- 
picture of a Haldorian, completely 
uniformed with polished power 
boots and rayer, a crawler to the 
higher-ups and a stomper on the 
lower-downs, a Fighter Basic with 
no compassion but with a certified 
aptitude for advancement to at 
least the rank of Trontar. 

“Fighter Basic Ruxt,” the Dis- 
positions Hweetoral announced.

“Here, Sir!” 

“Your application for transfer to 
Statistical Services has been dis- 
approved.” The two-striper’s ex- 
pression showed what he, as a fight- 
ing man, thought of the Statistical 
Services. “But we’ve got a real as- 
signment for you, Ruxt! The 27th 
Invasion Force is all set to drop on 
a new system. You’re lucky, Ruxt, 
that you put in that application. 
We had to hold you till it bounced. 
Your buddies got shipped to those 
rear-echelon guard outfits, but 
you’re going to a real fighting one. 
It should be a good invasion — this 
new system’s got atomic fission, I 
hear. And I’d like to tell you some- 
thing, Ruxt . .” 

“I know what. Sir,” I said. “You 
envy me.” 

T he 27th was a real fighting 
unit all right: they had their 
own neckerchief, their own war cry, 
and a general who was on his way 
up. Now they had me. 

And they Were going to get an- 
other system for thei Haldorian 
Empire. 

You see, those intelligent worms, 
or maybe they are slugs — I’m a 
bit vague on universe geography — 
over on the next Galaxy but one, 
give us Haldorians all sorts of diffi- 
culties. They insist on freedom, 
self-determination, and all that 
sort of thing. That’s all very well, 
but they insist on them for them- 
selves. Our high-level planners de- 
SUCCESS STORY 



cided that another solar system 
would make a better offensive set- 
up for Haldoria. The planners, I 
xmderstand, have all sorts of eso- 
teric theories about the ideal shape 
and size of an offensive unit. They 
ring in time and something related 
to time which makes Galaxy dis- 
tances differ according to which 
direction you are travelling. As I 
say, esoteric. 

The only thing that mattered 
to me was that some technicians 
had fed some data into a computer 
and it had hiccupped and said; 
“You’ll need such-and-such a planet 
to control such-and-such a solar 
system, and that will give you a 
better offensive set-up.” Then the 
computer hiccuped again and said; 
“You’ll need to draft and train 
Ameet Ruxt to help on this little 
job of taking over this planet 
called Terra, or Earth.” 

That’s what it amounted to, any- 
how. Consequently I joined the 
27th Invasion Force. 

“So you’ve got an application in 
for transfer to the Statistical Ser- 
vices, huh?” Trontar Hytd, my 
new platoon three-striper, asked 
when I reported in for duty with 
the 27th. 

“Yes, Sir.” I’d learned, along the 
line, that one should never give 
up when applying for a transfer- 
just keep one in the mill. 

“Huh, Borr, this new guy likes 
to work with figures,” Trontar 
Hytd growled at Hweetoral Borr, 

15 



my new squad leader. “Thinks he 
doesn’t want to be a Fighter.” 
Trontar Hytd looked at me ques- 
tioningly. 

I didn’t say anything. I’d 
learned a lot in Basic Fighter 
Course. 

“Figures?” asked Hweetoral 
Borr. I could see a train of thought 
had been started in the Hwee- 
toral’s mind. 

“Yeah, figures,” snapped Tron- 
ter Hytd. “He likes to count 
things, Borr. Get it?” 

“Guess we need all our ray 
charges counted, for one thing,” 
suggested Hweetoral Borr. “I get 
all mixed up with them figures.” 

“After training hours, of course,” 
Trontar Hytd said. 

“Of course, Trontar. And some- 
one’s gotta jawbone some kind of 
report on ammo expenditures 
every training day. Maybe after 
the rest of us have sacked in, for 
instance?” 

“Of course. Okay, Hweetoral, I 
guess you got the idea.” 

Invasion was almost a relief af- 
ter that brief bit of refresher train- 
ing the 27th was going through. 

Our General-on-the-way-up had 
outlined his plan of attack : 
“Drop’m, hit’m, lift’m and drop’m 
again.” So I dropped, hit the de- 
fenders, was lifted to a new cen- 
ter of resistance, and dropped 
again. I understand it was a stand- 
ard type of invasion, there’s only 
one way to do simple things. 

16 



^~kNCE in a while, these days, 
I remember those sadistic 
and battle-hardened comrades of 
mine. Hard, gutsy Trontar Hytd 
stayed on his feet to direct his 
platoon underground after our 
Kansas force collapsed, and one 
of those little fission weapons sepa- 
rated his body parts too widely for 
even our unsentimentally compe- 
tent surgeon/replacer to reassem- 
ble him. Well, they had a go at the 
job, but they had to ray down what 
they created — some primitive re- 
gression had set in and the crea- 
ture was hungry. 

And rough and tough Hweetoral 
Borr incautiously scratched his 
hairy ear just when one of those 
rude projectile weapons was fir- 
ing at him. The slug slipped 
through that opening the Hwee- 
toral had made in his body armor. 
With the brain gone — or such 
brain as Hweetoral Borr possessed 
— our kindly old surgeon/ replacer 
was foxed again. 

Then there were the new 
germs . 

But these things are as nothing 
to the creative military mind. A 
swarm of regulations, manuals and 
directives issue forth from head- 
quarters, and force fields cease to 
collapse, and fighters keep their 
body armor on and adjusted. 
When something like the influenza 
germ wipes out half a platoon, the 
wheels turn, a new vaccine is de- 
vised, and no more Haldorians die 
GALAXY 



from that particular germ. All the 
individual has to do is to live from 
one injection to the next (any civi- 
lized enemy always dreams up 
new diseases), move from one 
enemy strong point to the next, 
and dream of the day when he can 
return to his old life. For me it was 
a dream of returning to that quiet 
tiny room with its walls lined with 
the best of Haldorian art — just 
cheap reproductions, of course — 
and never again to handle a rayer 
or to wear armor. Real life, mean- 
while, went on. 

“Fighter First-Class Ruxt! Take 
these men and blast that strong 
point!” That would be the order 
somewhere in Missouri, or maybe 
in Mississippi — I never was much 
good on micro-geography. “Hwee- 
toral Ruxt! Take your squad and 
clean out that city. New Orleans 
they call it. Get their formal sur- 
render and make damn sure there 
are no guerrillas left when the col- 
onel comes through to inspect.” 

By the time I was Trontar Ruxt 
the invasion was p>ractically over. 
As I say, it was the standard thing 
with one or two countries holding 
out after all hope was gone — Eng- 
land never did formally surrender, 
not that it mattered — and our suc- 
cessful General was made a Sub- 
Marshal of the Haldorian Empire. 

A real promotion and a great 
honor. Much good it did him when 
he ventured his battle fleet too far 
into the Slug lines a year later. 



With the fighting over — the 
real fighting, I mean — the ever- 
efficient Haldorians started mov- 
ing their troops off Earth to get 
ready for a new and bigger inva- 
sion that the computers had de- 
creed. Only a few troops were to 
be left behind for occupation and 
guard stuff. 

I had a talk with a fat Assign- 
ments Trontar in his plush office. 

“You know, Trontar,” I said, “I 
was hoping to see more of this 
world here, and the rumor is that 
all of us excess combat t5T3es are 
being shipped to a training world 
to be shaped into new invasion 
forces.” 

“Tough,” he said. He should 
know. He’d requisitioned a man- 
sion complete with servants and 
everything. He even had a native 
trained to drive one of their lux- 
uriously inefficient ground ve- 
hicles. What a deal! That Trontar 
had no worries, his anti-grav ray 
was working. 

heard that a man doesn’t 
even need any money if he’s 
stationed down at our headquar- 
ters,” I said, and I hauled out a 
handful of Haldorian notes from 
my pocket. “Guess I wouldn’t need 
this stuff if I was transferred down 
to our headquarters.” 

“Who needs money?” he asked. 
“Guys all the time trying to bribe 
me, Trontar. You’d be surprised. 
Sure glad you aren’t, though, be-

17 



cause I do hate to turn anyone in.” 
I put the money back in my 
pocket. “Speaking of turning in 
people,” I said casually, “you ever 
have any trouble with the under- 
cover boys about all this loot 
you’ve picked up?” This, I 
thought, would shake him — and 
at the same time I marvelled at 
how I’d changed from a simple, 
naive statistician to a tough and 
conniving combat NCO. 

He yawned all over his fat face 
and swung his swivel chair so that 
he could better admire the pic- 
ture beside his desk. I recognized 
the picture as a moderately good 
reproduction of a Huxtner, a 
minor painter of our XXVth. 
“No,” the Assignments Trontar 
said, “it turns out that one of my 
sept brothers runs the local watch 
birds. He often drops in here to 
visit with me. But anything I can 
do for you, Trontar?” 

“No,” I said, and I fired at the 
only possible loophole left, “I’ll 
just leave quietly so you can ad- 
mire your Huxtner.” 

He swung back to me with a 
start. “You recognize a Huxtner? 
You’re the first man I’ve ever met 
in the service who ever heard of 
Huxtner, let alone recognizing one 
of his masterpieces! Hey, did you 
know I brought this all the way 
from home in my hammock roll? 
And just look at the coloring of 
that figure there!” 

The loophole had been blasted 



wide open. “You’re lucky,” I said, 
and I went on to lie about how I’d 
lost my own Huxtner prints in the 
invasion. “No one,” I continued, 
“ever got quite that flesh tint of 
Huxtner’s, did they?” 

Huxtner, by the way, is notori- 
ous for using a yellow undercoat 
for his blue flesh colors, unlike 
every realistic painter before or 
after who have all used green un- 
dercoats — what else? Imagine a 
chrome-yellow underlaying a blue 
skin color. All Huxtner’s figures 
look like two-week corpses — but 
Huxtner enthusiasts are unique. 

The Assignments Trontar and 
I had a nice long chat about Huxt- 
ner, at the conclusion of which he 
insisted on scratching my name 
from the list of combat-bound men 
and putting me on a much smaller 
' list of men scheduled for our guard 
outfit, stationed at the old Terran 
capital of Washington. 

I had an un-Haldorian feeling 
of having arranged my own life 
after that incident. That feeling 
persisted even after I took over 
one of the guard platoons and dis- 
covered that life in a guard outfit 
is rather similar to Basic Fighter 
Course. 

“Trontar Ruxt! Two men of 
your platoon have tarnished ar- 
mor. Get them working on it, and 
maybe you’d better stay and see 
that they do it properly.” 

“Yes, Sir.” 

One lives and learns. I turned

the job of supervising the armor 
cleaning to the Hweetorals of the 
squads and then I went home to 
my native woman. Yes, this 
guard’s outfit life was like Fighter 
Basic Course. 

But only for the lower ranks. 

Ill 

T IFE wasn’t too unendurable in 
those days. The duties were 
incredibly dull, of course, but the 
danger of sudden death had re- 
ceded, since only a few fanatics 
still tried to pick off us occupation 
troops. And this new world of Hal- 
doria’s was rich in the things a sen- 
sitive and artistic man appreci- 
ates; painting, sculpture, music. 
Then there was this new and 
pleasing thing of living with a 
woman . 

But it wouldn’t last long. 

Soon there’d be another planet 
to invade and maybe a space bat- 
tle with the great enemy. More 
years of cramped living and lurk- 
ing danger, for in the Empire one 
was drafted for the duration, and 
this duration was now some four 
hundred years old. The most 
Trontar Ruxt could expect, the 
very most, was to somehow keep 
alive for another fifty years and 
then to retire on a small pension 
to one of the lesser worlds of the 
Empire. 

“Trontar Ruxt! Your records 
show that you’re a statistician.” 

20 



My commanding officer stared at 
me suspiciously, for a fighting man, 
even one on guard duty, distrusts 
office personnel. And as everyone 
knows, “Once a fighting man, al- 
ways a fighting man.” I think my 
C.O.’s last action had been thirty 
years ago. 

“I was a statistician before I got 
in the service. Sir.” 

“Well, they’re screaming over at 
headquarters for qualified office 
personnel, and we have to send 
them any trained men we have — 
of any rank.” 

“It’s for Haldor, Sir,” I said. By 
now I knew the correct answer was 
most often the noncommittal one. 

I reported to the Headquarters, 
27th Invasion Force. The rumor 
was that Phase II, Reduction of 
Inhabitants to Slavery with Ship- 
ment to Haldorian Colonies, was 
about to start. And also, our Plan- 
ners were supposed to be well into 
Phase III, Terraforming, already. 
Terraforming was necessary, of 
course, to bring the average tem- 
perature of earth down to some- 
thing like the sub-arctic so that we 
Haldorians could live here in com- 
fort. We lost quite a few fighters 
during invasion when their cooling 
systems broke down. Rumor, as al- 
ways, was dead right; and the 
Headquarters was a mad rat-race. 

The Senior Trontar of the of- 
fice was delighted to get another 
body. 

“Took your time getting here, 
GALAXY 



Ruxt! You guard louts don’t know 
the meaning of time, do you?” 

I remained at attention. 

“So you’re a statistician, are 
you? Well, we don’t need any 
statisticians now. We just got in a 
1 whole squad of them. Can you use 
i a writer, maybe?” 

^ iiV ES, Sir,” I did not remind 
^ the Senior Trontar that us- 
ing a writer was a clerk’s job, not 
a Trontar’s, not a combat three- 
striper’s, because the chances were 
that he-knew it, for one thing. And 
he could easily make me a clerk, 
for another thing. 

“Okay. New that we understand 
each other,” the Senior Trontar 
grinned, “or that you understand 
me, which is all that matters, 
here’s your job.” He handed me a 
stack of scribbled notes, some rolls 
of speech tape and a couple of 
cans of visual stuff. “Make up a 
report in standard format like this 
example. Consolidate all this stuff 
into it. This report has to be ready 
in two days, and it has to be per- 
fect. No misspellings, no erasures, 
no nothing. Got that?” 

“Yes, Sir.” 

, “Yes, Sir,” he mimicked. “Hal- 
dor only knows why they couldn’t 
j send me a few clerks instead of a 
j squad of statisticians and one 
guard trontar. Do you know what 
this stuff is that you’re going to 
work up? It’s the final report on 
our invasion here!” 



I looked impressed. Strange 
how you learn, after a while, even 
the facial expression you are sup- 
posed to wear. 

“Do you know why this report 
has to be perfect in format and 
appearance?” I wouldn’t say the 
Senior Trontar’s manner was bul- 
lying, quite. Perhaps one could 
call it hectoring. “Because the 
Accountant is out in this sector 
somewhere and we have to be 
ready for him if he drops in.” 

This time I didn’t have to try 
to look impressed. The Accoimt- 
ant is the man who passes judg- 
ment on the conduct of all mili- 
tary matters — though of course 
he’s not one man, but maybe a 
dozen of them. Armed with the 
invaluable weapon of hindsight, 
he drops in after an invasion is 
completed. He determines whether 
the affair has gone according to 
regulations, or whether there has 
been carelessness, slackness or 
wasting of Haldorian resources of 
men or material. Additionally he 
monitors civil administration of 
colonies and federated worlds. 
There are stories of Generals be- 
coming Fighter Basics and Chief 
Administrators becoming sub- 
clerks after an Accountant’s visit. 

I GOT the report done, but it 
took the full two days— mainly 
because fighting men make such 
incomplete and erroneous reports 
while action is going on. I got to

understand the exasperated con- 
cern of office personnel who have 
to consolidate varied fragments 
into a coherent whole. And add- 
ing to the natural difficulties of 
the task was the continual pres- 
ence of the Senior Trontar, and 
his barbed comments and lurid 
promises as to what would follow 
my failure at the work. 

But the rejjort was done and 
sent in to the Adjutant. 

It came back covered with 
scribbled changes, additions, and 
deletions — and it came back car- 
ried by a much disturbed Senior 
Trontar. 

“Who in Haldor do they think 
I am?” he moaned. “I just handed 
on to you the figures that they 
gave me. Me! And threatening 
me with duty on a space freighter 
. and one into the Slug area at 
that!” 

I thougnt, as I looked at my 
ruined script, that guard duty 
wasn’t so bad, and that even com- 
bat wasn’t rough all the time. 

“See, Trontar,” the four-striper 
said, calling me by my proper 
rank for the first time, “you did 
a good job, the Adjutant himself 
said so. But these figures . .” he 
shuddered. “If the Accountant 
should see these we’d all be for 
it. Space-freighter duty would be 
getting off light.” The Senior 
Trontar seemed almost human to 
me right then. 

“I just put down what you 
gave me,” I said. 

22 



“Yeah, sure, Ruxt But I didn’t 
realize, nobody realized, how bad 
the figures were till they were all 
together and written up. Look, 
this report shows that we 
shouldn’t Terraform this planet 
— that we can’t make a nudnick 
on the slavery proposition — and 
that maybe we shouldn’t have 
even invaded this inferno at all.” 

“So what do you want me to 
do?” 

“I’ll tell you what you’re going 
to do . .” The Senior Trontar 
had regained his normal nasty 
disposition. “You’re going to re- 
do this report. You’re going to 
re-do it starting now, you’re going 
to work on it all night, and you’re 
going to have it on my desk and 
in perfect shape when I come in 
in the morning, or, by Haldor, the 
next thing you write will be your 
transfer to the space freighter 
run nearest the Slug Galaxy.” The 
Senior Trontar ran momentarily 
out of breath. “And,” he came 
back strongly, “you won’t be going 
as no Trontar, neither!” 

“It’ll be on your desk in the 
morning. Sir,” I said. 

Deck hands on the space 
freighter run were, I’d heard, par- 
ticularity expendable. 

T3 Y the middle of the third 
^ watch I had completed a 
perfect copy of the report com- 
plete with attachments, appen- 
dices, and supplements. And also 
by this time I knew from the dif- 



GALAXY 



ferences between the original re- 
port and this jawboned version 
that someone had goofed badly in 
undertaking this invasion, and 
then had goofed worse in not 
calling the thing off. Now there 
was to be considerable covering- 
up of tracks. The thought sud- 
denly came to me that a guard’s 
trontar named Ruxt knew rather 
a lot of what had gone on. Follow- 
ing that mildly worrying thought 
came a notion that perhaps a 
guard’s trontar named Ruxt might 
be considered by some as just 
another set of tracks to be cov- 
ered up. That far-off retirement 
on a small but steady income be- 
came even more unlikely, and 
the piossibilities began to appear 
of a quick end in the Slug-shat- 
tered hulk of a space freighter. 

Had the Senior Trontar changed 
in his attitude towards me, to- 
wards the end of the day, perhaps 
acted as though I were a con- 
demned man? Possibly. And had 
some of the officers been whis- 
pering about me late in the af- 
ternoon? Could have been. 

Shaken, I wandered down to 
the mess hall and joined a group 
of third-watch guards, who were 
goofing off while their Trontar 
was checking more distant guard 
posts. 

“It’s easy,” one of them was 
telling the others. “All you got to 
do is to slip some surgeon/re- 
placer a few big notes and he 



gives you this operation which 
makes you look like a native. And 
then you just settle down on 
Astarte for the rest of your life 
with the women just begging you 
to let them support you.” 

“You mean you’d rather live 
on some lousy federated world 
than be a Haldorian in the In- 
vasion Forces?” There was a 
strong sardonic note in the ques- 
tioner’s voice. 

“Man, you ever been on As- 
tarte?” the first man asked in- 
credulously. 

“Yeah, but how are you going 
to be sure that the surgeon/re- 
placer doesn’t turn you in?” ob- 
jected one of the others. “He 
could take your money, do the 
operation, and have you picked 
up. That way he’d have the 
money and get a medal too.” 
“I’d get around that,” the talky 
guy said, “I’d just . .” 

At this point he was jabbed in 
the arm by one of his buddies who 
had noticed my eavesdropping. 
The man shut up. All four of them 
drifted off to their posts. 

1 WENT reluctantly back to 
the office. From then till dawn 
I dreamed up and rehearsed all 
manner of wild schemes to take 
me out of this dangerous situa- 
tion. Or was it all perhaps just 
imagination? A Haldorian Tron- 
tar should never be guilty of an 
excess of that quality. But I made 



SUCCESS STORY 



23 



sure when the Senior Trontar 
sneaked in a bit before the regular 
opening time, that I was just, ai>- 
parently, completing the last page 
of the report. The impression I 
hoped to convey was that I had 
spent the entire night in working 
and worrying. 

“It’s okay,” the Senior Trontar 
growled after he had studied the 
completed report. “Guess you can 
take a couple of days off, Ruxt. I 
believe in taking care of my men. 
Say,” he asked casually, “I sup- 
pose you didn’t understand those 
figures you were working up, did 
you?” 

“No,” I said, “I didn’t pay any 
attention to them, they were just 
something to copy, that’s all.” I 
felt confident that I could out- 
fence the Senior Trontar any time 
at this little game, but what had 
he and the Adjutant been whis- 
pering about before they had 
come in? 

“But you used to be a statisti- 
cian, didn’t you?” He looked at 
the far corner of the room and 
smiled slightly. “But you take a 
couple days off, Ruxt. Maybe 
we’ll find something good for you 
when you come back.” He smiled 
again. “Don’t forget to check out 
with the Locator before you go, 
though. We don’t want to lose 
you.” 

I stumbled home, not even no- 
ticing the hate-filled glances my 
armor and blue skin drew from 



the natives along the streets. The 
glances were standard, but this 
feeling of being doomed was new. 

They were going to get me. I 
felt sure of that, even though my 
Sike Test Scores had always been 
as low as any normal's. But how 
could a Haldorian disappear on 
this planet? Aside from skin color, 
there was the need to keep body 
temperatures at a livable level 
The body armor unit was good 
only for about a week. Find a 
surgeon/replacer and bribe him 
to change me to an Earthman? I 
saw now how ridiculous such an 
idea was. But was there nothing 
but to wait passively while the 
Senior Trontar and the Adjutant, 
and whoever else did the dirty 
work, all got together and rail- 
roaded me off? 

Haldorians, though, never sur- 
render — or so the Mil Prop lad 
would have us believe. Right from 
the time you are four years old 
and you start seeing the legend- 
ary founders of Haldoria — Bordt 
and Smordt — fighting off the 
fierce six-legged carnivores, you 
are told never to give up. “Where 
there’s Haldor, there’s Hope!” 
“There’s always another stone for 
the wolves, if you but look.” I 
must confess I’d snickered (way 
deep inside, naturally) at these 
exhortations ever since I’d reached 
the age of thinking, but now all 
these childhood admonitions came 
rushing back to give me strength. 



24 



GALAXY 



quite as they were intended to 
do. I found that I could but go 
down like any Haldorian, fight- 
ing to the last. 

IV 

S O I put on my dress uniform 
the next day, and made sure 
that nothing could be deader 
than the dulled bits, or brighter 
than the polished ones. A bit of 
this effort was wasted since I ar- 
rived at Headquarters looking 
something less than sharp. The 
cooling unit in my armor was 
acting up a bit; and, also, three 
Terran city guerillas had tried to 
ambush me on the way. You take 
quite a jolt from a land mine, 
even with armor set on maximum. 
Some of those people never knew 
when they were licked. No won- 
der their Spanglt Resistance Quo- 
tient was close to the highest on 
record. 

I got through the three lines 
of guards and protective force 
fields all right, checking my rayer 
here, my armor there — the usual 
dull procedure. By the time I 
reached the Admissions Officer 
I was down to imiform and 
medals. 

“You want to see tihie Account- 
ant?” the Admissions Officer 
asked incredulously. “You mean 
one of his staff! Well, where’s 
your request slip, Trontar?” 

“I’ve come on my own. Sir,” I 



said, “not from my office, so I 
haven’t a request slip.” 

“Come on your own? Whafs 
your unit? Give me your ID 
card!” 

Let’s see, I thought. I’ve ab- 
stracted classified material from 
the files and carried it outside 
the office, I’ve broken the chain 
of command and communication, 
and, worst of all, I’d tried to see 
a senior officer without a request 
slip. Yeah, maybe I’d be lucky to 
end up as a live deckhand on a 
space freighter. 

A bored young Zankor with 
the rarely-seen balance insignia of 
the Accoimtant’s Office rose from 
behind the Admissions Officer. 

“I’ll take responsibility for this 
man,” he said casually to the A.O. 
“Follow me, Trontar. I was won- 
dering when you’d turn up.” 

“Me?” 

“Well, someone like you. 
Though usually it’s scared sub- 
clerks that we drag up. And that 
reminds me.” He turned to an- 
other young and equally bored 
Zankor standing nearby. “Take 
over, Smit, will you? They’re 
bringing in that sub-clerk who’s 
been writing those anonymous 
letters. I’ve reserved the Inquisi- 
tion Room for a couple of hours 
for him.” 

I followed the Zankor as he 
strode away, wondering as I did 
if they had more than one Inqui- 
sition Room.

He led me into a small room 
just off the corridor and motioned 
me to a chair. “Before you see the 
Accountant, Trontar,” he said, 
“I’ll have to screen what you 
have. It may be that we won’t 
have to botber the Accountant 
at all.” 

' I ^HE smooth way the Zankor 
talked and his friendly man- 
ner almost convinced me that we 
should both put the interests of 
the Accountant first. But then it 
occurred to me that a man with 
the gold knot of a Zankor on his 
collar wasn’t often friendly with 
a mere Trontar. That thought 
snapped me out of it and I knew 
I should only give the minimums. 

“I’ve got documents,” I said 
— “document” is such a lovely 
strong word, “which prove that 
the official report on the invasion 
and occupation of this planet is 
false.” That, I thought, was as 
minimum as one could get. 

“Ah, and have you?” The Zan- 
kor still looked bored. “Well, let’s 
see them, Trontar,” he said 
briskly. 

The Zankor had that sincere 
look the upper class always uses 
when they are about to do you 
dirt. They blush that heavy shade 
of blue, almost purple, and they 
look you straight in the eye, and 
they quiver a bit as to voice . 
and the next thing you know, 
you’re shafted. 



“I’m sorry, Sir,” I said, “but 
what I have is so important that 
I can give it to the Accountant 
only.” 

He stared at me for rather a 
long moment, pondering, no 
doubt, the pleasures of witnessing 
a full-dress military flogging. Then 
he shrugged and picked up the 
speaker beside him. He didn’t 
call the Trontar of the Guard to 
come and take my documents by 
force. I could tell that even 
though he spoke in High Haldo- 
rian, that harsh language the up- 
per class are so proud of preserv- 
ing as a relic from the days of 
the early conquerors. No, he was 
speaking to a superior — there’s 
never any doubt as to who is on 
top when people are speaking 
High Haldorian — and then I 
caught the emphatic negative con- 
nected with the present-day Hal- 
dorian phrases meaning Phase II 
and Phase III, Terraforming. So 
even though I don’t know High 
Haldorian, and would never be 
so incautious as to admit it if 
I did, I knew roughly what had 
been said. 

And I was frantically revising 
my plans. 

“Follow me,” the Zankor said, 
after completing the call. “We’ll 
see the Accountant now, and — ” 
he looked at me sincerely — 
“you’d better have something 
very good indeed. You really had, 
Trontar.” 



T he Accountant turned out to 
be a tall and thin Full Mar- 
I shal, the first I’d seen. He was 
dressed in a uniform subtly dif- 
ferent from the regulation, and he 
i wore only one tiny ribbon, which 
i I didn’t recognize. He had the 
I slightly deeper-blue skin you 
often see on the upper classes, 
though this impression may have 
1 been due to the green furnishings 
' of the room. It was, in fact, called 
the Green Room, when the Ter- 
rans had used it as one of their 
regional capitals. 

I saluted the Accountant with 
my best salute, the kind you lift 
like it was sugar and drop as if it 
were the other. The Accountant 
responded with one of those neg- 
ligent waves that tell you the 
saluter was a survivor of the best 
and bloodiest private military 
school in existence. 

“Proceed, Trontar,” the Ac- 
countant said, leaning back and 
relaxing as if he didn’t have a care 
in the universe. 

I launched into my speech, the 
one I’d been mentally rehearsing. 
I told him I knew I was breaking 
the chain of communication, but 
I that I was doing it for the service 
! and for Haldoria, etc. Any old 
j serviceman knows the routine. I 
was, as I ran through this speech, 
I just as sincere and just as earnest- 
I ly interested in the good of Hal- 
doria as any Haldorian combat 
Trontar could be. But, deep in- 



side me, the old Ameet Ruxt was 
both marveling at the change in 
himself and cynically appreciating 
the performance. 

The Accountant interrupted 
the performance about halfway 
through. “Yes, yes, Trontar,” he 
said brusquely, “I think we can 
assume your action is for the good 
of Haldoria, may the Empire in- 
crease and the Emperor live for- 
ever. Yes. But you say you have 
material dealing with the overall 
report on our invasion and occu- 
pation of this planet. You further 
say this material shows discrep- 
ancies in the official report — 
which you imply you have seen.” 

“Yes, Sir,” I said, and I handed 
over the several sheets of paper 
which comprised the old report 
and the changes of the new. 
Meanwhile, behind me, the Zan- 
kor was invisible but I had not 
a doubt but that he was there, 
keeping the regulation distance 
from me. 

These people knew their busi- 
ness. 

The Accountant took the col- 
lection of papers and compared 
them with some others he had on 
his desk. I continued to stand at 
Full Brace. Once you’ve been 
chewed out for slipping into an 
Ease position without being so 
ordered, you never forget. 

The Accountant laid down the 
papers, scanned my face, got up 
and walked to the far end of the

room. In front of a mirror he 
stopped and fingered that one 
small ribbon, quite, I thou^t, 
as if he were matching it with 
another one. 

He came back quickly and sat 
down again. “Zankor,” he said, 
“set up a meeting with the top 
brass for this afternoon. I’ll talk 
with the Trontar privately.” 



The Zankor saluted and was 
on his way out the door when the 
Accountant spoke again. “And 
Zankor ...” 

“Yes, Sir?” [ 

“I should be very unhappy if | 
the top brass here — the present ' 
top brass — found out about this 
material the Trontar brought.” 
The Zankor swallowed hard 



and assured the Accountant that 
he imderstood . .“Sir.” 

T hen we were alone and the 
Accountant was suddenly a 
kindly old man who invited me to 
sit down and relax. I did. I really 
let go and stretched out, I forgot 
everything I’d ever been taught 
as a child or had learned on my 



climb to the status of Trontar. I 
relaxed and he had me. 

I had been caught on the stan- 
dard Haldorian Soft/Hard Tac- 
tic. 

“Disabuse your mind, Trontar,” 
the Accoimtant snapped, and he 
was no longer a kindly old man 
but a thin-lipped Haldorian snap- 
per, “of any idea that you have

saved llie Empire — or any such 
nonsense!” Having cracked his 
verbal whip about my Moulders 
he just crouched there, glaring at 
me, his mouth entirely vanished 
and his eyes — well, I’d just as 
soon not think about some things. 

Yes, and then he gave me the 
Shout/Silence treatment, the 
whole thing so masterfully timed 
that at the end he could have 
signed me on as a permanent la- 
trine keeper on a spy satellite in 
the Slug Galaxy. A genius, that 
man was. The sort of man who 
could — and probably did — con- 
trol forty wives without a weapon. 

“Your information, as it hap- 
pens,” he said after I had regain^ 
my senses, “checks with other 
data I’ve received. It might be, of 
course, that the whole thing is a 
fabrication of my enemies. In that 
case, Trontar — ” he looked at me 
earnestly — “you can be assured 
you’ll not be around to rejoice 
at or to profit from my down- 
fall.” 

“Of course. Sir,” I said, quite as 
earnestly as he. 

“But we both know that you 
are only a genuine patriot,” he 
said with a hearty chuckle, a 
chuckle exactly like that of a 
Father Goodness — that kindly 
old godfather who brings such nice 
presents to every Haldorian child 
until they are six, and who on that 
last exciting visit brings, and en- 
thusiastically uses, a bundle of 



large and heavy whips to demon- j 
strate that no one can be trusted, i 
Efficient teachers, the Haldorians. J 
“Just a genuine patriot,” the j 
Accovmtant repeated “who has | 
rendered a considerable service to , 
the Empire. Trontar,” he said, all 
friendly and intimate, “the Em- 
pire likes to reward well its faith- 
ful sons. What would you most 
like to have or to do?” 

“To serve Haldoria, Sir!” I was [ 
back on my mental feet at last 
He dropped his act then. He 
was, I think, just practicing any- 
way. We had a short talk then, 
the kind in which one person is 
quickly and efficiently pumped 
of eversdhing he knows. After 
about ten minutes of question and 
answers, the Accountant leaned 
back and studied my face care- 
fully. 

“Have you considered Officers’ 
Selection Course, Trontar? I 
might be able to help you a little 
in getting in.” 

Officers’ Selection Course was, 

I knew. Fighter Basic Course mul- 
tiplied in length and casualties. 
Less than 20 per cent graduate 
... or escape. 

iilVO, Sir,” I said. “I wondered 
if I mightn’t be of more 
value to Haldoria in some way 
other than being in the combat 
services.” So now I’d said, it and 
there was nothing to do but to go 
on. “Perhaps,” I ventured, “I might 



30 



GALAXY 



be of some help in the adminis- 
trative services.” 

The Accoimtant said nothing, 
his face was immobile, his hands 
still. He’d learned his lessons well, 
once. 

“In fact,” I said, deciding to go 
for broke, “with my knowledge of 
the language and the customs 
here, I might be of most service 
to Haldoria right here on this 
planet” 

“Had you guessed, by any 
chance, Trontar,” the Account- 
ant’s voice was neutrally soft, 
“that we won’t be terraforming 
this world? And that we may not 
even exploit the slavery propo- 
sition?” 

“I thought both those possibili- 
ties likely,” I admitted. 

“But you know that in such a 
case we would have no admini- 
strative services on this world? 
Thus you are, in fact, asking for 
a position that wouldn’t exist.” 
The Accountant, without a change 
of position of expression, some- 
how gave the impression of loom- 
ing over me. 

“I thought,” I said, trying to 
pick exactly the right words, and 
at the same time all too conscious 
of a twitching muscle in my left 
eyelid, “that there might be an 
analogous position, even so.” 

The Accountant loomed higher. 

“If only,” he said, “you hadn’t 
come to us, Trontar. I mean that 
you, in effect, sold your associ- 



ates out to me. And I hold that 
once a seller, always a seller. If I 
could be certain that you are and 
will be perfectly loyal to the Hal- 
dorian Way . .” 

I managed to quiet the twitch- 
ing eyelid and to look perfectly 
loyal to the Haldorian Way. 

“Yes, Trontar,” the Accoimtant 
said decisively, “I’ll buy it.” 

T he results of my conference 
with the Accountant were not 
long in appearing. 

The Haldorian troops were 
called in, along with the military 
governors and the whole admini- 
strative body, and they all shipped 
out, somewhere into the Big Out- 
There they all love so much. A 
surprised Earth was informed that 
she was now a full-fledged and 
self-governing member of the Hal- 
dorian Empire. The Terrans were 
not informed of the economic fac- 
tors behind this decision, though 
it might have been cheering for 
them to know that their Spanglt 
Resistance Quotient indicated 
they would make unsatisfactory 
slaves. Nor did the high cost of 
terraforming the planet get men- 
tioned. We Haldorians prefer the 
gratitude of others towards us to 
be unalloyed with baser, or cal- 
culating, emotions. 

Not all the Haldorian personnel 
went out to fight or to administer. 
I understand the space-freighter 
run to the battle fleet in the Slug

Galaxy gained many new deck- 
hands, among them one whose 
uniform showed the marks where 
Trontar’s stripes had perched. 

As for myself? 

Well, a relatively minor opera- 
tion changed me into a black- 
skinned Terran, though the sur- 
geon/replacers could do nothing, 
ironically enough in view of my 
new color, to increase my resist- 
ance to heat. I refnember those 
stirring days of combat some- 
times, usually when I am making 
my semi-annual flight between 
Churchill, Manitoba, and Tierra 
Del Fuego. In fact, during those 
flights when I am practically 
alone is the only time I have to 
reflect or remember, because on 
both of my estates there is no- 
thing but noise, children, and 
wives. 

But ifs a good life when the 
snow is driving down out of a low 



gray overcast, just like it does 
back on Haldor. It’s a good life 
being Resident Trader on Terra, 
especially when one is, on the 
side, a trusted agent of the Ac- 
countant. It would be a perfect 
life — if the Accountant hadn’t 
been right about people being 
unable to stop selling out. 

Right now I’m up to my neck 
in this Terran conspiracy to re- 
volt against the very light bonds 
Haldoria left on this planet. But 
how could I resist the tempting 
offer the Terrans made me? The 
long sought-for good life, it now 
occurs to me, isn’t so much in 
escaping from something, but in 
knowing when to stop. But that 
I know. I’m drawing the line 
right now. I’ll just tell that agent 
of the Slug Galaxy that I have 
no intention of selling out both 
this solar system and Haldoria!

Condition of Empioyment 

By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 

This was one time when there 
had to be — just had to be — a 
way to keep a good man down! 

Illustrated by MACK 



H e had been dreaming of 
home, and when he came 
awake, he held his eyes 
tight shut in a desperate effort not 
to lose the dream. He kept some 
of it, but it was blurred and faint 
and lacked the sharp distinction 
and the color of the dream. He 
could tell it to himself, he knew 
just how it was, he could recall it 
as a lost and far-off thing and place. 



but it was not there as it had been 
in the dream. 

But even so, he held his eyes 
tight shut, for now that he was 
awake, he knew what they’d open 
on, and he shrank from the drab- 
ness and the coldness of the room 
in which he lay. It was, he thought, 
not alone the drabness and the cold, 
but also the loneliness and the sense 
of not belonging. So long as he did

not look at it, he need not accept 
this harsh reality, although he felt 
himself on the fringe of it, and it 
was reaching for him, reaching 
through the color and the warmth 
and friendliness of this other place 
he tried to keep in mind. 

At last it was impossible. The 
fabric of the held-onto dream be- 
came too thin and fragile to ward 
off the moment of reality, and he 
let his eyes come open. 

It was every bit as bad as he 
remembered it. It was drab and 
cold and harsh, and there was the 
maddening alienness waiting for 
him, crouching in the comer. He 
tensed himself against it, trying to 
work up his courage, hardening 
himself to arise and face it for an- 
other day. 

The plaster of the ceiling was 
cracked and had flaked away in 
great ugly blotches. The paint on 
the wall was peeling and dark stains 
ran down it from the times the 
rain leaked in. And there was the 
smell, the musty human smell that 
had been caged in the room too 
long. 

Staring at the ceiling, he tried 
to see the sky. There had been a 
time when he could have seen it 
through this or any ceiling. For the 
sky had belonged to him, the sky 
and the wild, dark space beyond it. 
But now he’d lost them. They were 
his no longer. 

A few marks in a book, he 
thought, an entry in the record. 

34 



That was all that was needed to 
smash a man’s career, to cmsh his 
hope forever and to keep him 
trapped and exiled on a planet that 
was not his own. 

He sat up and swung his feet 
over the edge of the bed, himting 
for the trousers he’d left on the 
floor. He foimd and pulled them on 
and scuffed into his shoes and stood 
up in the room. 

' I ’ HE room was small and mean 
—and cheap. There would come 
a day when he could not afford a 
room even as cheap as this. His 
cash was nmning out, and when 
the last of it was gone, he would 
have to get some job, any kind of 
job. Perhaps he should have got- 
ten one before he began to run so 
short. But he had shied away from 
it. For settling down to work would 
be an admission that he was de- 
feated, that he had given up his 
hope of going home again. 

He had been a fool, he told him- 
self, for ever going into space. Let 
him just get back to Mars and no 
one could ever get him off it. He’d 
go back to the ranch and stay there 
as his father had waflted him to 
do. He’d marry Ellen and settle 
down, and other fools could fly the 
death-traps around the Solar Sys- 
tem. 

Glamor, he thought — it was the 
glamor that sucked in the kids 
when they were young and starry- 
eyed. The glamor of the far place. 



GALAXY 



of the wilderness of space, of the 
white eyes of the stars watching in 
that wilderness — the glamor of 
the engine-song and of the chill 
white metal knifing through the 
blackness and the loneliness of the 
emptiness, and the few cubic feet 
of courage and defiance that 
thumbed its nose at that emptiness. 

But there was no glamor. There 
was brutal work and everlasting 
watchfulness and awful sickness, 
the terrible fear that listened for the 
stutter in the drive, for the ping 
against the metal hide, for any one 
of the thousand things that could 
happen out in space. 

He picked up his wallet off the 
bedside table and put it in his 
pocket and went out into the hall 
and down the rickety stairs to the 
crumbling, lopsided porch outside. 

And the greenness waited for 
him, the unrelenting, bilious green 
of Earth. It was a thing to gag at, 
to steel oneself against, an indecent 
and abhorrent color for anyone to 
look at. The grass was green and 
all the plants and every single tree. 
There was no place outdoors and 
few indoors where one could escape 
from it, and when one looked at it 
too long, it seemed to pulse and 
tremble with a hidden life. 

The greenness, and the bright- 
ness of the sun, and the sapping 
heat — these were things of Earth 
that it was hard to bear. The light 
one could get away from, and the 
heat one could somehow ride along 



with — but the green was always 
there. 

He went down the steps, fum- 
bling in his pocket for a cigarette. 
He found a crumpled package and 
in it one crumpled cigarette. He 
put it between his lips and threw 
the pack away and stood at the 
gate, trying to make up his mind. 

13 UT it was a gesture only, this 
hardening of his mind, for he 
knew what he would do. There was 
nothing else to do. He’d done it 
day after day for more weeks than 
he cared to count, and he’d do it 
again today and tomorrow and to- 
morrow, until his cash ran out 

And after that, he wondered, 
what? 

Get a job and try to strike a bar- 
gain with his situation? Try to save 
against the day when he could buy 
passage back to Mars — for they’d 
surely let him ride the ships even 
if they wouldn’t let him run them. 
But, he told himself, he’d figured 
that one out. It would take twenty 
years to save enough, and he had no 
twenty years. 

He lit the cigarette and went 
tramping down the street, and even 
through tile cigarette, he could 
smell the hated green. 

Ten blocks later, he reached the 
far edge of the spaceport. There 
was a ship. He stood for a moment 
looking at it before he went into 
the shabby restaurant to buy him- 
self some breakfast. 



CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT 



35 



There was a ship, he thought, 
and that was a hopeful sign. Some 
days there weren’t any, some days 
three or four. But there was a ship 
today and it might be the one. 

One day, he told himself, he’d 
surely find the ship out there that 
would take him home — a ship with 
a captain so desperate for an engi- 
neer that he would overlook the 
entry in the book. 

But even as he thought it, he 
knew it for a lie — a lie he told him- 
self each day. Perhaps to justify 
his coming here each day to check 
at the hiring hall, a lie to keep his 
hope alive, to keep his courage up. 
A lie that made it even barely pos- 
sible to face the bleak, warm room 
and the green of Earth. 

He went into the restaurant and 
sat down on a stool. 

The waitress came to take his 
order. “Cakes again?” she asked. 

He nodded. Pancakes were 
cheap and filling and he had to 
make his money last. 

“You’ll find a ship today,” said 
the waitress. “I have a feeling you 
will.” 

“Perhaps I will,” he said, without 
believing it. 

“I know just how you feel,” the 
waitress told him. “I know how aw- 
ful it can be. I was homesick once 
myself, the first time I left home. I 
thought I would die.” 

He didn’t answer, for he felt it 
would not have been dignified to 
answer. Although why he should 



now lay claim to dignity, he could 
not imagine. 

But this, in any case, was more 
than simple homesickness. It was 
planetsickness, culturesickness, a 
cutting off of all he’d known and 
wanted. 

S ITTING, waiting for the cakes 
to cook, he caught the dream 
again — the dream of red hills roll- 
ing far into the land, of the cold, 
dry air soft against the skin, of the 
splendor of the stars at twilight and 
the faery yellow of the distant 
sandstorm. And the low house 
crouched against the land, with the 
old gray-haired man sitting stiffly 
in a chair upon the porch that faced 
toward the svmset. 

The waitress brought the cakes. 
The day would come, he told 
himself, when he could afford no 
longer this self-pity he carried. He 
knew it for what it was and he 
should get rid of it. And yet it was 
a thing he lived with — even more 
than that, it had become a way of 
life. It was his comfort and his 
shield, the driving force Jiat kept 
him trudging on each day. 

He finished the cakes and paid 
for them. 

“Good luck,” said the waitress, 
with a smile. 

“Thank you,” he said. 

He tramped down the road, with 
the gravel crunching underfoot and 
the sim like a blast upon his back, 
but he had left the greenness. The

port lay bare and bald, scalped and 
cauterized. 

He reached where he was going 
and went up to the desk. 

“You again,” said the union 
agent 

“Anything for Mars?” 

“Not a thing. No, wait a minute. 
There was a man in here not too 
long ago.” 

The agent got up from the desk 
and went to the door. Then he 
stepped outside the door and began 
to shout at someone. 

A few m i nutes later, he was back. 
Behind him came a lumbering and 
irate individual. He had a cap upon 
his head that said CAPTAIN in 
greasy, torn letters, but aside from 
that he was distinctly out of uni- 
form. 

“Here’s the man,” the agent told 
the captain. “Name of Anson Coop- 
er. Engineer first class, but his 
record’s not too good.” 

“Damn the record!” bawled the 
captain. He said to Cooper: “Do 
you know Morrisons?” 

“I was raised with them,” said 
Cooper. It was not the truth, but 
he knew he could get by. 

“They’re good engines,” said the 
captain, “but cranky and demand- 
ing. You’ll have to baby them. 
You’ll have to sleep with them. 
And if you don’t watch them close, 
they’ll up and break your back.” 

“I know how to handle them,” 
said Cooper. 

“My engineer ran out on me.” 



The captain spat on the floor to 
show his contempt for runaway en- 
gineers. “He wasn’t man enough.” 
“I’m man enough,” Cooper de- 
clared. 

A ND he knew, standing there, 
what it would be like. But there 
was no other choice. If he wanted 
to get back to Mars, he had to take 
the Morrisons. 

“O.K., then, come on with you,” 
the captain said. 

“Wait a minute,” said the imion 
agent. “You can’t rush off a man 
like this. You have to give him 
time to pick up his duffle.” 

“I haven’t any to pick up,” Coop- 
er said, thinking of the few pitiful 
belongings back in the boarding 
house. “Or none that matters.” 
“You imder stand,” the agent said 
to the captain, “that the union can- 
not vouch for a man with a record 
such as his.” 

“To hell with that,” said the cap- 
tain. “Just so he can run the en- 
gines. That’s all I ask.” 

The ship stood far out in the 
field. She had not been much to 
start with and she had not im- 
proved with age. Just the job of 
riding on a craft like that would be 
high torture, without the worry of 
nursing Morrisons. 

“She’ll hang together, no fear,” 
said the captain. “She’s got a lot 
more trips left in her than you’d 
think. It beats all hell what a tub 
like that can take.” ,

Just one more trip, thought 
Cooper. Just so she gets me to 
Mars. Then she can fall apart, for 
all I care. 

“She’s beautiful,” he said, and 
meant it. 

He walked up to one of the great 
landing fins and laid a hand upon 
it. It was solid metal, with all the 
paint peeled off it, with tiny pits 
of corrosion speckling its surface 
and with a hint of cold, as if if 
might not as yet have shed all the 
touch of space. 

And this was it, he thought. After 
all the weeks of waiting, here finally 
was the thing of steel and engineer- 
ing that would take him home 
again. 

He walked back to where the 
captain stood. 

“Let’s get on with it,” he said. 
“I’ll want to look the engines over.” 

“They’re all right,” said captain. 

“That may be so. I still want to 
run a check on them.” 

He had expected the engines to 
be bad, but not as bad as they 
turned out to be. If the ship had not 
been much to look at, the Morri- 
sons were worse. 

“They’ll need some work,” he 
said. “We can’t lift with them, the 
shape they’re in.” 

The captain raved and swore. 
“We have to blast by dawn, damn 
it! This is a goddam emergency.” 

“You’ll lift by dawn,” snapped 
Cooper. “Just leave me alone.” 

He drove his gang to work, and 



he worked himself, for fourteen 
solid hours, without a wink of 
sleep, without a bite to eat 

Then he crossed his fingers and 
told the captain he was ready. 

They got out of atmosphere 
with the engines holding together. 
Cooper imcrossed the fingers and 
sighed with deep relief. Now all he 
had to do was keep them running. 

^ I ^ HE captain called him forward 
and brought out a bottle. “You 
did better, Mr. Cooper, than I 
thought you would.” 

Cooper shook his head. “We 
aren’t there yet. Captain. We’ve a 
long way still to go.” 

“Mr. Cooper,” said the captain, 
“you know what we are carrying? 
You got any idea at all?” 

Cooper shook his head. 
“Medicines,” the captain told 
him. “There’s an epidemic out 
there. We were the only ship any- 
where near ready for takeoff. So 
we were requisitioned.” 

“It would have been much bet- 
ter if we could have overhauled the 
engines.” 

‘We didn’t have the time. Every 
minute counts.” 

Cooper drank the liquor, stupid 
with a tiredness that cut clear to 
the bone. “Epidemic, you say. What 
kind?” 

“Sand fever,” said the captain. 
“You’ve heard of it, perhaps.” 
Cooper felt the chill of deadly 
fear creep along his body. “I’ve 



CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT 



39 



heard of it.” He finished off the 
whisky and stood up. “I have to get 
back, sir. I have to watch those 
engines.” 

“We’re counting on you, Mr. 
Cooper. You have to get us 
through.” 

He went back to the engine room 
and slumped into a chair, listening 
to the engine-song that beat 
throughout the ship. 

He had to keep them going. 
There was no question of it now, if 
there’d even been a question. For 
now it was not the simple matter of 
getting home again, but of getting 
needed drugs to the old home 
planet. 

“I promise you,” he said, talking 
to himself. “I promise you we’ll get 
there.” 

He drove the engine crew and 
he drove himself, day after dying 
day, while the howling of the tubes 
and the thunder of the hajnvire 
Morrisons racked a man almost 
beyond endurance. 

There was no such thing as 
sleep — only catnaps caught as one 
could catch them. There were no 
such things as meals, only food 
gulped on the run. And there was 
work, and worse than work were 
the watching and the waiting, the 
shoulders tensed against the stutter 
or the sudden screech of metal that 
would spell disaster. 

Why, he wondered dully, did a 
man ever go to space? Why should 
one deliberately choose a job like 



this? Here in the engine room, 
with its cranky motors, it might be 
worse than elsewhere in the ship. 
But that didn’t mean it wasn’t bad. 
For throughout the ship stretched 
tension and discomfort and, above 
all, the dead, black fear of space 
itself, of what space could do to a 
ship and the men within it 

I N some of the bigger, newer 
ships, conditions might be bet- 
ter, but not a great deal better. 
They still tranquilized the passen- 
gers and colonists who went out to 
the other planets — tranquilized 
them to quiet the worries, to make 
them more insensitive to discom- 
fort, to prevent their breaking into 
panic. 

But a crew you could not tran- 
quilize. A crew must be wide- 
awake, with all its faculties intact. 
A crew had to sit and take it. 

Perhaps the time would come 
when the ships were big enough, 
when the engines and the drives 
would be perfected, when Man had 
lost some of his fear of the empti- 
ness of space — then it would be 
easier. 

But the time might be far off. 
It was almost two hundred years 
now since his family had gone out, 
among the first colonists, to Mars. 

If it were not that he was going 
home, he told himself, it would be 
beyond all tolerance and endur- 
ance. He could almost smell the 
cold, dry air of home — even in this 



40 



GALAXY 



place that reeked with other smells. 
He could look beyond the metal 
skin of the ship in which he rode 
and across the long dark miles and 
see the gentle sunset on the redness 
of the hills. 

And in this he had an advantage 
over all the others. For without 
going home, he could not have 
stood it. 

The days wore on and the en- 
gines held and the hope built up 
within him. And finally hope gave 
way to triumph. 

And then came the day when the 
ship went mushing down through 
the thin, cold atmosphere and came 
in to a landing. 

He reached out and pulled a 
switch and the engines rumbled to 
a halt. Silence came into the tor- 
tured steel that still was numb with 
noise. 

He stood beside the engines, 
deafened by the silence, frightened 
by this alien thing that never made 
a sound. 

He walked along the engines, 
with his hand sliding on their metal, 
stroking them as he would pet an 
animal, astonished and slightly 
angry at himself for finding in him- 
self a queer, distorted quality of 
affection for them. 

But why not? They had brought 
him home. He had nursed and 
pampered them, he had cursed 
them and watched over them, he 
had slept with them, and they had 
brought him home. 



And that was more, he admitted 
to himself, then he had ever 
thought they would do. 

¥TE foimd that he was alone. The 
crew had gone swarming up 
the ladder as soon as he had pulled 
the switch. And now it was time 
that he himself was going. 

But he stood there for a moment, 
in that silent room, as he gave the 
place one final visual check. Every- 
thing was all right. There was noth- 
ing to be done. 

He turned and climbed the lad- 
der slowly, heading for the port. 

He foimd the captain standing in 
the port, and out beyond the port 
stretched the redness of the land. 

“All the rest have gone except 
the purser,” said the captain. ‘T 
thought you’d soon be up. You did 
a fine job with the engines, Mr. 
Cooper. I’m glad you shipped with 
us.” 

“It’s my last run,” Cooper said, 
staring out at the redness of the 
hills. “Now I settle down.” 

“That’s strange,” said the cap- 
tain. “I take it you’re a Mars man.” 

“I am. And I never should have 
left.” 

The captain stared at him and 
said again: “That’s strange.” 

“Nothing strange,” said Cooper. 

» 

“It’s my last run, too,” the cap- 
tain broke in. “There’ll be a new 
commander to take her back to 
Earth.” -

41 



“In that case,” Cooper offered, 
“I’ll stand you a drink as soon as 
we get down.” 

“I’ll take you up on that First 
we’ll get our shots.” 

They climbed down the ladder 
and walked across the field toward 
the spaceport buildings. Trucks 
went whining past them, heading 
for the ship, to pick up the un- 
loaded cargo. 

And now it was all coming back 
to Cooper, the way he had dreamed 
it in that shabby room on Earth — 
the exhilarating taste of the thinner, 
colder air, the step that was spring- 
ier because of the lesser gravity, 
the swift and clean elation of the 
uncluttered, brave red land beneath 
a weaker sun. 

Inside, the doctor waited for 
them in his tiny office. 

“Sorry, gentlemen,” he said, “but 
you know the regulations.” 

“I don’t like it,” said the captain, 
“but I suppose it does make sense.” 

They sat down in the chairs and 
rolled up their sleeves. 

“Hang on,” the doctor told them. 
“It gives you quite a jolt.” 

It did. 

And it had before, thought Coop- 
er, every time before. He should 
be used to it by now. 

He sat weakly in the chair, wait- 
ing for the weakness and the shock 
to pass, and he saw the doctor, there 
behind his desk, watching them 
and waiting for them to come 
aroimd to normal. 



“Was it a rough trip?” the doctor 
finally asked. 

“They all are rough,” the captain 
replied curtly. 

Cooper shook his head. “This 
one was the worst I’ve ever known. 
Those engines . .” 

^ I '' HE captain said: “I’m sorry, 
-*• Cooper. This time it was the 
truth. We were really carrying 
medicine. There is an epidemic. 
Mine was the only ship. I’d planned 
an overhaul, but we couldn’t wait.” 

Cooper nodded. “I remember 
now,” he said. 

He stood up weakly and stared 
out the window at the cold, the 
alien, the forbidding land of Mars. 

“I never could have made it,” 
he said flafly, “if I’d not been 
psychoed.” 

He turned back to the doctor. 
“Will there ever be a time?” 

The doctor nodded. “Some day, 
certainly. When the ships are bet- 
ter. When the race is more condi- 
tioned to space travel.” 

“But this homesickness business 
— it gets downright brutal.” 

“It’s the only way,” the doctor 
declared. ‘We’d not have any 
spacemen if they weren’t always 
going home.” 

“That’s right,” the captain said. 
“No man, myself included, could 
face that kind of beating unless it 
was for something more than 
money.” 

Cooper looked out the window 
GALAXY 



42 



r 



at the Martian sandscape and shiv- 
ered. Of all the God-forsaken places 
he had ever seen! 

He was a fool to be in space, he 
told himself, with a wife like Doris 
and two kids back home. He could 
hardly wait to see them. 

And he knew the symptoms. He 
was getting homesick once again 
— but this time it was for Earth. 

The doctor was taking a bottle 
out of his desk and pouring gen- 



erous drinks into glasses for all 
three of them. 

“Have a shot of this,” he said, 
“and let’s forget about it” 

“As if we could remember,” said 
Cooper, laughing suddenly. 

“After all,” the captain said, far 
too cheerfully, “we have to see it in 
the right perspective. It’s nothing 
more than a condition of employ- 
ment.”

FORECAST 

The next issue solves a vital problem that we have spent all this while 
trying to work out: how to get a novel of such freshness, ingenuity, suspense 
— and stature — that it could bridge the gap between issues. To solve that 
problem, Frederik Pohl has out-Pohled himself, a big deal indeed for one 
who has given us Gravy Planet and other such great Galaxy book-length 
serials. 

In DRUNKARD'S WALK — a tipsy title, but a sure-footed story — the 
main character is plagued by a terrifying, utterly baffling assassin. Night 
, after night, the assassin stalks him and will not rpst until he is dead. A com- 
monplace predicament in fiction, of course. But in this case, it is not the man 
being stalked who must be dead. It is the assassin! Nor is this simply an 
O. Henry switcheroo — the hard, cold, completely logical reasons will sweep 
you through the two installments of this compelling story. 

Along with this big half of a true, honest-Injun, fair-dinkum, so-help-us 
book-length nove' — not a "shortened version" — we've managed to cram 
in at least two novelets. 

TRANSSTAR, by Raymond E. Banks, is the story of the war that no one 
dares fight — and the man whose duty lies in preventing that war — by 
, forgetting where his duty stops! 

j A name new to our pages is William W. Stuart, but it won't be new 

for long. You'll agree when you read his brilliant novelet, INSIDE JOHN 
BARTH. Barth has always dreamed of seeing a Garden of Eden — and dis- 
covers that he would rather see than be one! 

I Short stories? Of course. Edgar Pangborn for sure, after too long an 

; absence since his magnificent Angel's Egg and The Music Master of Babylon, 
plus others, as many as we can fit in — along with Willy Ley's always enjoy- 
able column and our regular features. 

A fine issue. Don't skip it.

Anyone should be free to take an 

impossible stand — except that is 
where the nuse man does business! 

Illustrated by WOOD 



T he clerk in the utility of- 
fice looked at Denham si- 
lently. It was a look which, 
to Denham, seemed haughty, inso- 
lent and supercilious — qualities he 



was ready by now to discern in the 
whole utility company. 

“If you dispute the amount of 
the bill, sir,” the clerk said, “you 
should deposit the sum in question 
GALAXY 



^th the Utilities Commission 
while they examine your claim.” 
“Listen,” Denham said, fumbling 
in his pockets, “all I’m asking is 
that you send the meter reader out 
again.” He pulled out a handful of 
receipted bills. “Look at these. 
Electricity in June, $7.45. In July, 
$8.32. In August, $3.30 — that was 
because Franny and I were on va- 
cation. In September, $7.91. And 
then in October you send in a bill 
for $875! It’s not reasonable!” 
The clerk opened the book on 
the desk in front of him and pointed 
at a page. “Section five, paragraph 
10, sub-section 13,” he said wood- 
enly. ““lu case of disputed bills, 
customers must deposit the amoimt 
in dispute with the—’ ” 

“I tell you, it’s some blasted mis- 
take! Somebody’s mislocated the 
decimal point! Where am I to get 
$875 to deposit? If you’d send me 
a bill for $8,750, or $87,500, would 
you still expect me to deposit it 
with die Utilities Commission?” 
“‘—must deposit the amount in 
dispute with an impartial authority, 
in this case the Utilities Commis- 
sion,’ ” he continued imperturbably. 
“Tending settlement of the dis- 
puted claim, such deposits are to 
draw interest at the rate of 2.2% 
per annum. In case— ” 

“All ri^t!” Denham yelled. Two 
people who had been talking to 
other clerks at the desk started and 
turned around to look at him. “All 
right!” He had completely lost the

slender hold he had been keeping 
on his temper, and he no longer 
cared. “Send your blasted mechanic 
around and have the blasted meter 
taken out!” 

A GAIN the clerk looked at him. 

It was, Denham was pleased 
to observe, a look quite different in 
quality from the ones he had previ- 
ously bestowed. It held respect, ad- 
miration, awe. “You mean you want 
us to have the electricity diut off? 
Why, sir, nobody ever does that!” 
“Well, I do!” Denham said. 

“But — but — how wiH you get 
along without it?” 

“That’s my problem,” Denham 
answered. “I’d rather do without 
power the rest of my life than de- 
posit $875 with the Utilities Com- 

• • M ' 

mission. 

“Very well, sir.” The clerk’s lips 
curved in a faint smile. “Now, if 
you’ll just sign this form . .” 
Outside in the street again, Den- 
ham felt the beginning of a qualm. 
Of course he and Franny would 
get along all right without power, 
the way people used to do. The 
pioneers hadn’t had electric refrig- 
erators. All the same, it might be 
rather a nuisance. There was the 
Halloween dinner they were giving 
for the in-laws on Saturday. 

The thing to do was to buy a 
couple of oil lamps, and a little 
kerosene stove for Franny to cook 
on. (But what about the food in the 
refrigerator, and the hot water sup- 

45 



ply? ) Oil lamps wouldn’t be so bad 
for a Halloween party — appropri- 
ate, in a way, to the spirit of the 
occasion. 

But if Mrs. Murgatroyd found 
out that he’d had the power shut 
off deliberately, she’d decide that 
it was just another proof of the 
way he mistreated her daughter. 
Denham was well aware that his 
mother-in-law considered him a 
heartless, inconsiderate brute. 
Franny might tell her mother as 
often as she pleased that she loved 
her husband and was happy with 
him : Mrs. Murgatroyd would sigh, 
close her eyes, shake her head, and 
murmur, “My poor little girl!” It 
was a remark that by now almost 
maddened Denham. He would go 
to nearly any length to avoid hear- 
ing it. For a moment he wondered 
whether it wouldn’t be wiser to go 
back to the power compan 5 ^s of- 
fice and ask to have the power 
turned on again. 

A man stepped out from a door- 
way and stood in Denham’s path. 
He was a tall, thin man with eye- 
brows which arched high on his 
forehead and then swooped down 
suddenly to the bridge of his nose, 
and his cheeks were sunken and 
pale. There was something inde- 
finably odd about his clothing. It 
looked, Denham thought, as if it 
had been made from a picture by a 
tailor who had never seen a suit of 
clothes. 

“Heigh, gesell,” he said in a 
46 



harsh, hoarse voice. “Would you be 
interested in some nuse?” 

“What?” Denham said, confused, 
“Nuse. The airy servitor. Omnia, 
cient, omnipotent, invisible. Like 
Prospero’s Ariel. ‘I come / To an. 
swer thy best pleasure; be’t to fly, 
/ To swim, to dive into the fire, to 
ride / On the curl’d clouds. To thy 
strong bidding task / Ariel and all 
his quality.’ The Tempest, scene 2, 
act 1. By Francis Bacon. Don’t 
think, use nuse.” 

“The Tempest?” Denham re- 
sponded blankly. 

^ I ^ HIS sudden excursion into cul- 
ture from one whom he had 
expected to offer him smuggled 
Alaskan sealskins, just off the boat 
and dirt cheap, bewildered Den- 
ham. “Whafre you talking about?” 
“Nuse. I said it was like Pros- 
pero’s Ariel. Don’t they teach you 
people Bacon in school these days? 
But never mind that, ges — I mean, 
sir. That little argument with the 
power company — you’re going to 
find it pretty tough getting along 
without electricity, you know. Why 
don’t you try nuse?” 

“You mean you’re selling boot- 
legged power from some fly-by- 
night company?” Denham asked 
suspiciously. 

The stranger hesitated. Then he 
appeared to make up his mind. “I 
can see you’re an intelligent man, 
ge — sir” he said. “As a matter of 
fact, I represent the Inter-Era 
■ GALAXY 



Trading and Exchange Corpora- 
tion. We specialize in selling prod- 
ucts of the future to the present 
day. Nuse is the most popular of 
them. Why don’t you give us a 
trial? I’m sure you’d be more than 

satisfied.” 

“We get our nuse direct from the 
producer, in 3,000 AJ3., and retail 
it to the present. Like all our items, 
it’s top quality. We’d have to ar- 
range a special installation, since 
today’s abode is somewhat more 
complicated than when I come 
from, but I can promise you an ade- 
quate supply of nuse within thirty 
minutes after you sign the author- 
ization. All fixed before your wife 
gets home.” He got a little dark- 
green box out of his waist pocket 
and showed it to Denham. “This is 
the plant.” 

Denham touched it gingerly. It 
felt warm and the surface was 
resilient. “Yes, but what is it? Some 
kind of power?” 

“More than power. Much, much 
more. As to what it is— well, wasn’t 
there a period when your scientists 
were uncertain as to the nature of 
electricity? We’re in much the 
same position with regard to nuse. 
All we know is that it is a trans- 
dimensional neural force. We get it, 
as I say, from the far side of 3,000 
A.D., but our scientists can only 
speculate on how it actually origi- 
nates.” 

‘You mean that if I let you put 
THE AIRY SERVITOR 



that gadget in my apartment, the 
appliances would still work?” Den- 
ham asked, grasping at straws. 
“Even thou^ the electricity is off?” 

“Certainly. Much better than 
ever before. And more than appli- 
ances. Having nuse in an abode is 
like having a dozen super-efficient 
servants working for you. Omnipo- 
tent, omniscient, invisible. Don’t 
think, use nuse.” 

“Well . .” Denham said. 

A S Denham stopped by at the 
novelty store on his way home, 
to pick up the favors and Halloween 
cut-outs Franny had asked him to 
get, he decided against telling her 
about the contract he had signed 
for nuse. It was perfectly straight- 
forward and businesslike, of course, 
but he had a feeling she might not 
care for the idea of having her elec- 
tric toaster worked by a trans- 
dimensional neural force that orig- 
inated on the far side of 3,000 a.d. 

He was relieved to find the 
apartment brightly lighted when 
he opened the door. That meant, 
or ought to mean, that the nuse 
man had been around and the nuse 
was already on the job. Invisible, 
omnipotent, omniscient. Don’t 
think, use nuse. 

“Hi, baby,” he greeted his wife. 
“Have a good day? An 5 rthing new?” 
He noticed she was wearing a faint 
frown. 

“Not much,” she answered, “only 
something sort of funny happened, 

47 




Gus. That strawberry mousse you 
like — I decided to make some for 
supper, and I got all the things for 
it out of the refrigerator. Then I 
decided I’d better comb my hair 
in case you got home ^ead of time. 
And when I went back to the 
kitchen, there the mousse was in 
the refrigerator, already mixed and 
everything. The dishes were 
washed and put away, too. And I 
don’t remember a single thing 
about doing it. Oh, Gus, do you 
suppose there’s anything wrong 
with my mind?” 

Denham gulped. Apparently the 
nuse wasn’t going to confine itself 
to small-time stuff like operating 
electric toasters and washing ma- 
chines. 

He comforted his wife by telling 
her that highly intelligent people 
not infrequently had these lapses, 
and then, while she was putting 
supper on the table, wandered out 
into the hall. After some searching 
he located the small green box the 
nuse man had showed him. It was 
low down by the kitchen door. No 
wires went into or came out of it. 
For the second time that day Den- 
ham touched it with his fingertips. 
This time it was definitely cold. 

The strawberry mousse, for the 
record, reached a new height of 
deliciousness. 

Denham’s shower next morning 
was perfert, not, as usual, scalding 
one minute and freezing the next

room to dress, he foimd his brown 
suit laid out neatly on the bed wait- 
ing for him. Memoranda and pa- 
pers had been transferred into the 
appropriate pockets. His shoes, too, 
were neatly shined. 

There was no use asking Franny 
whether die had done it — she was 
busy getting dressed herself, and 
he knew she had not It must be the 
nuse. 

Vl^^EN Denham got home that 
’ * night, he found Franny sitting 
on Ihe living room floor in tears. 
Her suitcase was in front of her, 
and various items of her trousseau 
lay on the rug aroimd her. 

“I’m losing my mind,” she qua- 
vered when she saw him. “Ever 
since I came home I’ve been doing 
things and forgetting about having 
done them. It’s terrible. I’m g-going 
to pack up and g-go home to 
Mother. Its not f-f-fair to -you.” 

“No, you’re not,” Denham an- 
swered grimly. He sat down on the 
floor beside her and told her what 
had happened. 

Franny took his disclosure with 
remarkable calm. “Oh, is that it? 
Why didn’t you tell me? Say, listen, 
though — it isn’t costing us an awful 
lot, is it?” 

“Only four fifty a month,” Den- 
ham answered. 

Franny’s expression grew 
pleased. “We paid more than that 
for electricity and it didn’t do lots 
of filings this new stuff does. Gus, 

49 



you know what I am planning to 
do?” 

“What?” Denham asked. 

“I’m going to have it clean up 
the whole place tomorrow, new 
shelf paper in the kitchen, windows, 
floors waxed, everything, and when 
Mother says, my, but I must get 
tired working so hard, I’m going 
to tell her you’ve insisted that I 
have a maid. Then I’m going to 
have it try a lot of those dishes in 
the Wine Cook Book you got me 
— the ones I never made because 
they s ."Hied too complicated — 
and when she mentions those, I’ll 
tell her tile maid did that too. And 
then I’ll have the nuse give me a 
facial and a manicure and set my 
hair a new way. I get so tired of 
the way Mother talks about you 
all tile time. Oh, Gus! Isn’t this lots 
of fun?” 

“Um,” Denham said, starting to 
worry because his wife was ac- 
cepting nuse with so much en- 
thusiasm. 

His mood of depression persisted 
all next day. Part of it, no doubt, 
could be accounted for by the un- 
attractive prospect of an evening 
with his in-laws, but there remained 
a residue of depression which Den- 
ham later was to ascribe to sheer 
prescience. If the nuse man had 
been around, he would have ex- 
pressed it, probably, by quoting 
Francis Bacon’s immortal Romeo 
and Juliet: “Oh, God, I have an 
ill-divining soul!” 

50 



D enham (he had to work on 
Saturdays) got home and the 
apartment was shining like a new 
penny, romantic aromas of herbs 
and wine filled the air, and Fraimy 
herself was resplendent in an odd 
but attractive hair-do. 

“How’d it go?” he asked her. 

“Oh, wonderful! At first I thought 
it would make me nervous to be 
waited on by something I couldn’t 
see, but it does it so quick, just like 
thinking, that I don’t have time to 
get scared. And it’s . awfully im- 
personal. 

“A funny thing happened, 
though, Gus. After I got the stuff 
out of the refrigerator for the ga- 
teau with sherry and cream filling, 
I got to thinking I’d have to watch 
my weight with all this rich food. 
Then I decided to taste the dessert 
to see if it was all right Would you 
believe it? The nuse wouldn’t let 
me taste it! It was just as though 
there was a wall between me and 
the gateau. It made me cross for 
a minute, but of course the nuse 
was right — it’s those little tastes 
that put the fat on.” 

“ITm,” Denham said uneasily. 
“Mother called up to say she’s 
bringing Aunt Agatha,” she said, 
watching him warily. 

“Aunt Agatha!” Denham’s jaw 
dropped in alarm. Mrs. Murga- 
troyd’s sister was deceptively mild- 
looking, but every bit as tou^ and 
mean as Mrs. Murgatroyd, and her 
footwork was a lot faster. 



GALAXY 



“Oh, Gus, don’t look at me like 
that She won’t hurt you. I’ve been 
thinking, and I’m sure the reason 
she and Mother don’t like you bet- 
ter is that they don’t know you 
well. If they were in closer contact 
with you, they’d realize how nice 
you really are. That’s why I’m put- 
ting you between them tonight.” 
There was a lengthy pause. 
“O.K.,” Denham said at last. 

The guests arrived at seven 
thirty-five. Mrs. Murgatroyd, Aunt 
Agatha, Mr. Murgatroyd (Denham 
liked his father-in-law whenever 
he remembered him), and Bert, 
Denham’s thirteen-year-old broth- 
er-in-law — Denham catalogued 
them miserably while he forced his 
reluctant face into a genial smile. 
He felt even more pessimistic and 
apprehensive than before. 

“ ’Lo, Gussie,” Bert said. He was 
wearing a cotton T shirt with “Bat 
M^n” written in large black letters 
across the chest. Under the words 
was tire silhouette of a nasty-look- 
ing bat. To the lapel of his jacket 
was pinned an improbably red rose. 
“What do you think of my flower?” 
“Fine,” Denham answered. The 
only good quality he had ever been 
able to discern in Bert was that the 
boy was a little too old to chew 
bubble gum. “Very pretty.” 

“Go on, smell it.” 

T TRGED, Denham bent. He was 
rewarded by a douche of cold 
water in the face. “Did you bite!” 

THE AIRY SERVITOR 



Bert said' with deep satisfaction, 
“Jeepers, did you bite!” 

“Now, Bert,” Mrs. Murgatroyd 
said, and then to Denham, in what 
might have been apology, “Bert’s 
sense of humor is so keen.” 

Denham went into the bathroom 
and dried his collar and his hair. 
Then he came back and handed 
around glasses of tomato juice. His 
own contained something different 
He tasted it cautiously and then 
with enthusiasm. Why had he been 
so apprehensive? They certainly 
understood how to mix drinks in 
3,000 A.D. Good old — yes, decid- 
edly — good old nuse! He had 
been longing for a drink, and here 
it was. 

The dinner, with the nuse im- 
obtrusively helping Franny serve, 
went off well. Even Mrs. Murga- 
troyd, who had plainly been skep- 
tical about Franny’s maid, grew 
mellow by the time the diners 
reached the gateau, and Denham, 
whose glass had been replenished 
several, times, felt himself upborne 
on a monumental euphoria. For a 
small sum, say two or three hun- 
dred dollars, he would have risked 
kissing his mother-in-law. 

His self-confidence sagged ab- 
ruptly at Franny’s next remark. 
“Gus, honey,” she said, “you go get 
the things out of the refrigerator, 
and we’ll play that game — you 
know, the one I read about in the 
party book. I’m sure Dad and Bert 
will enjoy playing it.” 



51 



Thou^ Denham rose obediently, 
he was feeling sick. He disliked 
Mrs. Murgatroyd and the nuse 
knew it; in the darkness, passing 
her bits of saturated sponge, chunks 
of suet, oysters limp and wet, who 
knew what dreadful thing might 
happen to her? He’d have to watch 
his thoughts, watch his thoughts. 

When he came back from the 
kitchen, the room was dark. He 
gave the parcel to Franny, sitting 
at the end of the table, and she 
began the narration. 

“There was an old witch who 
lived in a cellar,” she said impres- 
sively, “and she did terrible things. 
On Halloween I went to visit her, 
though they told me she was dead. 
I tripped over something on the 
floor and picked it up.” Franny 
fumbled in the parcel. She lowered 
her voice. “I knew at once that it 
was a piece of her arm.” 

Fanny passed the piece of lamb 
shank to Bert, who yipped. From 
Bert it went to Aunt Agatha, to 
Denham, to Mrs. Murgatroyd. 
There followed the witch’s teeth, 
tongue, stomach, and brain. The 
eyeballs, Denham thought appre- 
hensively, would be the worst. Raw 
oysters in the dark — ugh. What 
had possessed Franny to try this 
stunt, anyhow? She was a doll, but 
she could exhibit an unbelievable 
lack of tact. 

The eyeballs were not the worst. 
Before Denham even handed the 
oysters to Mrs. Murgatroyd, she 

52 



screamed piercingly. “Worms! 
Worms! You’ve filled my lap with 
worms!” 

I T was a shriek as demoralizing as 
a siren’s. Denham jumped. The 
lights came on. Mrs. Murgatroyd 
glared at him. There was nothing in 
her lap. 

“You did it!” she said fiercely to 
Denham. “You put worms in my 
lap. They wriggled horribly. And 
then you took them awsy again. 
You — you — oh, poor Franny, mar- 
ried to a man like you!” 

Denham had bitten his tongue 
so deeply at Mrs. Murgatroyd’s 
first shriek that he could hardly 
talk, and besides he was conscious 
of a deep bewilderment. Worms? 

Franny cut across the hubbub. 
“For goodness’ sake;, mother, be 
quiet! Gus didn’t do ansdhing. It 
was just your imagination. Gus, go 
get the apples and the tub. We’ll 
try another game.” 

Mrs. Murgatroyd and her sister 
— wisely, Denham thought — re- 
fused to bob for the apples floating 
in the tub. He would have liked 
to refuse himself, but Franny nod- 
ded at him commandingly. Dumb- 
ly, still nursing his bitten tongue, 
he took his place behind Bert. 

Mr. Murgatroyd was first. He 
hesitated, calculated, and then 
plunged. To his son-in-law’s sur- 
prise, he came up with a pippin 
firmly between his false teeth. 
“Nothin’ to it,” he said. 



GALAXY 



Fraimy was next. She got wet, 
she screeched. But on the third 
try she secured an apple. She 
smiled at Denham and bit into it. 

Then Bert Denham was con- 
scious of keeping a rigid mental 
grip on himself. It occurred to him 
suddenly that he had misinterpret- 
ed the meaning of the slogan, 
“Don’t think, use nuse.” It didn’t 
mean, as one might suppose, that 
using nuse would relieve one of 
wear and tear on the brain; it meant 
something much less agreeable — 
don’t ttunk, if you use nuse. 

Bert’s narrow back bent over the 
basin. There was a horrid feeling 
of tension and oppression in the 
atmosphere. Abruptly he dipped 
after an apple which floated near 
the edge. 

The water in the basin seemed 
to recoil from him. Then with a 
mighty spla^ it descended on Bert. 
Two of the apples hit him on the 
head. 

This time it took much longer 
to get Mrs. Murgatroyd calmed 
down. “You did it,” die repeated 
bitterly to Denham. “I saw you 
with my own eyes.” Denham 
couldn’t think of a thing to say that 
would make any sense. 

I^RS. MURGATROYD ges- 
tured toward Bert, who stood 
between them dripping vehe- 
mently. He was wet in the same 
thoroughgoing fashion that a long- 
haired dog gets wet; Denham had 
THE AIRY SERVITOR 



never seen a human being drip so 
hard. 

“Do you mean to tell me he did 
that by himself?” she demanded. 
“And look at those big bumps on 
his poor head! To think that a 
grown man could be so petty, so 
childish! Just because he played a 
harmless, boyish prank on you with 
his flower! This has opened my 
eyes, as if they needed opening, to 
the sort of man you are. Franny’s 
infatuated with you, of course; I 
only hope that this will help her to 
realize your true character.” 

Denham writhed helplessly. He 
honestly didn’t think it was his 
fault. He hadn’t been thinking 
about ansrthing. Over Mrs. Mur- 
gatroyd’s head he looked at the 
others. Mr. Murgatroyd, his fingers 
laced together over his stomach, 
was looking up at the ceiling. Aunt 
Agatha, on the other hand, watched 
the scene detachedly, while a faint 
smile played over her lips. Fraimy’s 
expression was shocked and incred- 
ulous. 

After a moment Denham caught 
his wife’s eyes. She raised her brows 
in a gesture of mute questioning. 
Passionately he shook his head, and 
was relieved to get a sickly grin 
from her in return. At least she 
realized he hadn’t meant to do 
whatever the nuse had done. 

Bert was led off to the bedroom 
and returned, somewhat drier, 
wearing Denham’s new silk dress- 
ing gown. As he passed his host, 

53 



Bert stuck out his tongue and 
thumbed his nose at him. Mrs. 
Murgatroyd, seeing her son still 
damp, began to talk all over again. 

“For heaven’s sakes, Mother,” 
Franny said, “a little water won’t 
hurt Bert. Gus! Will you get the 
donkey out of the closet? We’ll 
play another game.” 

Denham drew his wife aside. 
“Listen, honey,” he said earnestly, 
“do you think it’s safe? We’ve had 
quite a lot of trouble already, and 
if we get blindfolded and try to pin 
tails on that thing . Wouldn’t it 
be better just to sit quietly and talk 
or watch TV?” 

Franny looked miserable. “I 
know, Gus. I feel just as worried 
about it as you do. Something must 
have gone wrong with the nuse 
power source in the future. But 
if we don’t play a game or some- 
thing, Mother won’t go home or 
anything — she’ll just stay here and 
complain. I think you’d better go 
get the donkey game.” 

Denham for some reason was 
selected to try the tail-pinning first. 
He made a fool of himself by miss- 
ing the donkey completely and 
attaching the tails to the plaster of 
the wall. He was unblindfolded to 
the accompaniment of Bert’s malig- 
nantly triumphant howls. 

A FTER Denham, Franny. She 
did fairly well. Mr. Murga- 
troyd, to everyone’s surprise but 
his own, got two out of three tails 
54 



in the proper place. He retired to 
his chair with an air of modest 
competence. 

Mrs. Murgatroyd must have 
been stung by her spouse’s imex- 
pected success. At any rate she 
insisted on being blindfolded next, 
despite Franny’s obvious disincli- 
nation. Denham watched die proc- 
ess like a man who, tied helpless 
on top of a powder keg, sees the 
approach of matches and gasoline. 

His mother-in-law groped her 
way over to tiie wall. The first tail 
she pinned to the donkey’s chest, 
the second to the nape of its neck. 
The third she attached to the right 
hind leg. Nothing else happened. 
Denham sagged back, almost sick 
with relief. Whatever had gone 
wrong with the nuse source in 
3,000 A.D. must have been corrected 
again. 

“The plaster feels a little soft, 
Frances,” Mrs. Murgatroyd said as 
she surrendered the blindfold to 
Aunt Agatha. “Perhaps your hus- 
band—” she gave Denham a glance 
of pnire cyanide— “could repair it 
some time.” 

“Oh, I will,” Denham babbled. 
“Yes, certainly. Of course. Oh, yes, 
you bet.” He got out his handker- 
chief and wiped the sweat from his 
brow. When it was perfectly safe 
to do so, he decided, he’d have the 
nuse bring him another drink. 

Aunt Agatha passed her hand 
gropingly over the printed figure 
of the donkey. “The plaster does 

GALAXY 



feel a little soft, Kate,” she said to 
Mrs. Murgatroyd. She turned back 
to her task. “Yes> a little spongy 
and soft. Why, what on Earth— oh!” 

The wall had begun to fall down 
on her. 

First the wall, then the ceiling. 
Plaster fell in hunks, in chunks, in 
slabs. Some of it fell on Aunt 
Agatha, the rest on Mrs. Murga- 
troyd. Denham, though standing 
near them, was not touched. The 
falling plaster would have been 
noisy in itself, but it was accom- 
panied by a grinding, rending, 
crashing roar like a cyclone break- 
ing into a lion cage. 

The floor began to tremble. 
From the fireplace beside Den- 
ham, an andiron rose into the air 
and hurled itself at Mrs. Murga- 
troyd’s midriff. An ornamental 
plate rose dizzily from the dinner 
table. Twice it smacked itself force- 
fully against Mrs. Murgatroyd’s 
broad rear; then it flew over to 
Aunt Agatha and hit her in the 
face. One of the pair of silver can- 
dlesticks from the mantel bran- 
dished itself before the nose of 
Denham’s mother-in-law as if held 
in an angry hand. The other plum- 
meted down deliberately on Aimt 
Agatha’s toes. Franny was scream- 
ing at the top of her lungs. It was as 
if a covey of demented poltergeists 
was holding a convention in the 
room. 

Articles of futuristic construction, 
apparently materialized by the 
THE AIRY SERVITOR 



nuse on its own hook, rained past 
Denham’s head. Mrs. Murgatroyd 
was on her knees in the comer; 
Aunt Agatha was doubled up, with 
her arms raised to protect her head. 
Neither of them, since Aunt Aga- 
tha’s first astonished exclamation, 
had uttered a sound, and this si- 
lence, in sharp contrast with Fran- 
ny’s uninhibited shrieks, impressed 
Denham as profoundly unnatural. 

C UDDENLY the maniacal activ- 
^ ity suspended itself. Objects re- 
turned to their usual places or fell 
to the floor. There was an instant of 
static, frozen calm. Then the carpet 
tore itself loose from its moorings. 
With irresistible momentum it ad- 
vanced on the two cowering wom- 
en. For a moment it reared above 
them like a tidal wave; then it 
broke over their heads. 

With this final burst of energy, 
the nuse seemed to have exhausted 
itself. The carpet collapsed. After 
a moment Aunt Agatha pushed its 
stiff bulk aside and looked out. Her 
expression was still invincibly thild, 
but there were bits of plaster in her 
hair. 

Mrs. Murgatroyd wobbled to her 
feet. Her eyes were fixed on Den- 
ham. Her mouth opened and closed 
several times, but no sound came 
out. This uncharacteristic aphasia 
affected him almost more than 
words would have done. He looked 
hastily around the room in search 
of moral support. 



55 



Bert and Franny wore expres- 
sions suitable to persons who have 
just seen a dining room explode. 
But Mr. Murgatroyd — Denham 
looked at him with amazement 
which changed ^arply into out- 
raged comprehension — Mr. Mur- 
gatroyd was a happy man. Beam- 
ing and complacent, his hands 
clasped over his stomach, he re- 
garded the devastated scene. His 
eyes lingered on his wife’s bruised 
person with especial pleasure. 

So he was the cause of every- 
thing! No doubt he’d materialized 
the worms in his wife’s lap acci- 
dentally, realized that some strange 
power had obeyed him, and gone 
on to enjoy it! 

“Come, Kate,” Aunt Agatha, said, 
“let us leave this house.” 

And late as it was when they left, 
and tired as he was, Denham took 
a hammer and smashed the nuse. 



rhENHAM was on his way home 
from the office one evening 
in April when the ntise man stepped 
into his path. He looked leaner and 
less prosperous than when Deiffiam 
had seen him half a year before. 
He had the air, somehow, of a cat 
which has been chased away from 
a lot of garbage cans and will im- 
doubtedly be chased away from 
many more. 

“Heigh, gesell,” he said hoarsely, 
“how about buying an ipsissifex? 
Better even than nuse, the airy 
servitor. I hear you’re working 
pretty hard these days. Duplicate 
yourself and cut your work load. 
We guarantee up to ten perfect 
replic — heigh, wait! What are you 
looking at me like that for? Are you 
going to hit me too?” 

“I’m afraid I am,” Denham said, 
and he did.

The Lady 



No iob was ever uglier, nastier or deadlier — 
but out of it came a story to inspire generations. 



BY CORDWAINER SMITH 



\Hfho Sailed the Saul 

Illustrated by DILLON 



I 

T he story ran— how did the 
story run? Everyone knew 
the reference to Helen 
America and Mr. Gray-no-more, 



but no one knew exactly how it 
happened. Their names were 
welded to the glittering timeless 
jewelry of romance. Sometimes 
they were compared to Heloise 
and Abelard, whose story had been 







found among books in a long- 
buried library. Other ages were to 
compare their life with the weird, 
ugly-lovely story of the Go-Cap- 
tain Taliano and the Lady Dolores 
Oh. 

Out of it all, two things stood 
forth — their love and the image 
of the great sails, tissue-metal 
wings with which the bodies of peo- 
ple finally fluttered out among the 
stars. 

Mention him and others knew 
her. Mention her and they knew 
him. He was the first of the in- 
bound sailors, and she was the lady 
who sailed the Soul. 

It was lucky that people lost 
their pictures. The romantic hero 
was a very young-looking man, 
prematurely old and still quite sick 
when the romance came. And 
Helen America, she was a freak, 
but a nice one : a grim, solemn, sad 
little brunette who had been bom 
amid the laughter of humanity. 
She was not the tail, confident 
heroine of the actresses who later 
played her. 

She was, however, a wonderful 
sailor. That much was true. And 
with her body and mind she loved 
Mr. Gray-no-more, showing a de- 
votion which the ages can neither 
surpass nor forget. History may 
scrape off the patina of their names 
and appearances, but even history 
can do no more than brighten the 
love of Helen America and Mr. 
Gray-no-more. 



Both of them, one must rememi 
ber, were sailors. 

II 

Che was a child and she waai 
^ playing with a spieltier. She 
got tired of letting it be a chickei^ 
so she reversed it into the fur-bean 
ing position. When she extended 
the ears to the optimum develop 
ment, the little animal looked odd 
indeed. A light breeze blew the ani. 
mal-toy on its side, but the spiel- 
tier good-naturedly righted itself 
and munched contentedly on the 
carpet. 

The little girl suddenly clapped 
her hands and broke forth with the 
question, “Mama, what’s a sailor?” 

“There used to be sailors, dar- 
ling, a long time ago. They were 
brave men who took the ships out 
to the stars, the very first ships_feat 
took people away from our sua 
And they had big sails. I don’t 
know how it worked, but somehow 
the light pushed them, and it took 
them a quarter of a life to make a 
single one-way trip. People only 
lived a hundred and sixty years at 
that time, darling, and it was forty 
years each way, but we don’t need 
sailors any more.” 

“Of course not,” said the child 
“We can go right away. You’ve 
taken me to Mars and you’ve taken 
me to New Earth too, haven’t yop 
Mama? And we can go anywhere 
and it only takes one afternoon." 



“That’s pianoforming, honey, 
gut it was a long time before the 
people knew how to planoform. 
they could not travel the way 
could, so they made great big 
sails. They made sails so big that 
they could not build them on 
Earth. They had to hang them out 
halfway between Earth and Mars. 
And you know, a funny thing hap- 
pened . Did you ever hear about 
the time the world froze?” 

“No, Mama. What was that story 
about?” 

“Well, a long time ago, one of 
these sails drifted and people tried 
to save it because it took a lot of 
work to build it. But the sail was so 
large that it got between Earth and 
the sim. And there was no more 
sunshine, just night all the time. 
And it got very cold on Earth. All 
the atomic power plants were busy, 
and all the air began to smell fim- 
ny. And the people were worried 
and in a few days they pulled the 
sail back out of the way. And the 
sunshine came again.” 

“Mama, were there ever any 
girl sailors?” 

A curious expwression crossed 
over the mother’s face. “There 
was one. You’ll hear about her 
when you are older. Her name was 
Helen America and she sailed the 
Soul out to the stars. She is the 
only woman that ever did it. And 
that is a wonderful story.” 

The mother dabbled at her eyes 
with a handkerchief. 



The child said: “Mama, tell me 
now. Whafs ffie story all about?” 
At this point the mother became 
very firm and she said: “Honey, 
there are some things that you are 
not old enou^ to hear yet. But 
when you are a big girl. I’ll tell you 
all about them.” 

The mother was an honest wom- 
an. She reflected a moment, and 
then she added, “Unless you read 
about it yoiu^elf first.” 

Ill 

TTELEN America was to make 
-*-*• her place in the history of 
mankind, but she started badly. 
The name itself was a misfortune. 

No one ever knew who her 
father was. The officials agreed to 
keep the matter quiet. 

Her mother was not in doubt. 
Her mother was the celebrated 
she-man Mona Muggeridge, a 
woman who had campaigned a 
hundred times for the lost cause of 
complete identity of the two sexes. 
She had been a feminist beyond all 
limits, and when Mona Mugger- 
idge, the one and only Miss Mug- 
geridge, announced to the press 
that she was going to have a baby, 
that was first-class news. 

Mona Muggeridge went further. 
She proclaimed that no woman 
should have consecutive children 
with the same man, that women 
should be advised to pick different 
fathers for their children, so as to

THE LADY WHO SAILED THE SOUL 



61 



diversify and beautify the race. 
She capped it all by announcing 
that she, Miss Muggeridge, had 
selected the perfect father and 
would inevitably produce the only 
perfect child. 

Miss Muggeridge, a bony, pom- 
pous blonde, stated that she would 
avoid the nonsense of marriage and 
family names, and that therefore 
the child, if a boy, would be called 
John America, and, if a girl, Helen 
America. 

Thus it happened that little 
Helen America was born with the 
correspondents in the press serv- 
ices waiting outside the delivery 
'room. News screens flashed the 
picture of a pretty three-kilogram 
baby. 

That was just the beginning. 
Mona Muggeridge was belligerent. 
She insisted, even after the baby 
had been photographed for the 
thousandth time, that this was the 
finest child ever born. She pointed 
to the child’s perfections. She 
demonstrated all the foolish fand- 
ness of a doting mother, but felt 
that she, the great crusader, had 
discovered this fondness for the 
first time. 

Helen America was a wonderful 
example of raw human material 
triumphing over its tormentors. By 
the time she was four years old, she 
spoke six languages, and was be- 
ginning to decipher some of the old 
Martian texts. At the age of five 
she was sent to school. Her fellow 

62 



school children immediately 
vented a rh3mie: 

“Helen, Helen, 

Fat and dumb. 

Doesn’t know where 
Her daddy’s from!” 

Helen took all this and perhaj 
it was an accident of genetics tha 
she grew to become a compact lit 
tie person — a deadly serious littii 
brunette. Challenged by lessonj 
haunted by publicity, she becami 
careful and reserved about friend 
ships, and desperately lonely. 

When Helen America was six 
teen, her mother came to a bai 
end. Mona Muggeridge elopa 
with a man she announced to h 
the perfect husband for the perfed 
marriage hitherto overlooked bj 
mankind. The perfect husband wai 
a skilled machine polisher. He al 
ready had a wife and four children 
He drank beer and his interest it 
Miss Muggeridge seems to havi 
been a mixture of good-naturet 
comradeship and a sensible aware 
ness of her motherly bankroll. Thi 
planetary yacht on which thej 
eloped broke the regulations wifi 
off-schedule flight. The bride 
groom’s wife and children hat 
alerted police. The result was i 
collision with a robot barge whid 
left both bodies identifiable. 

At sixteen Helen was alreadj 
famous, and at seventeen alreadj 
forgotten, and very much alone.

IV 

T his was the age of sailors. The; 

thousands of photo-reconnais- 
sance and measuring missiles had 
begun to come back with their har- 
vest from the stars. Planet after 
planet swam into the ken of man- 
kind. The new worlds became 
known as the interstellar search 
missiles brought back photographs, 
samples of atmosphere, measure- 
ments of gravity, cloud coverage, 
chemical makeup and the like. 

Of the very numerous missiles 
which returned from their two- or 
three-hundred-year voyages, five 
brought back reports of New 
Earth, a planet so much like Terra 
itself that it could be settled. 

The first sailors had gone out 
almost a hundred years before. 
They had started with small sails 
not over two thousand miles 
square. Gradually the size of the 
fails increased. The technique of 
adiabatic packing and the carrying 
of passengers in individual pods 
reduced the damage done to the 
human cargo. It was great news 
when a sailor returned to Earth, a 
man born and reared under the 
light of another star. He was a man 
who had spent a month of agony 
and pain, bringing a few sleep- 
frozen settlers, guiding the im- 
mense light-pushed sailing craft 
which had managed the trip in an 
objective-time period of forty 
years. 

THE LADY WHO SAILED THE 



Mankind got to know the look 
of a sailor. There was a plantigrade 
walk to the way he put his whole 
body on bed, couch or ground. 
There was a sharp, stiff, mechani- 
cal swing to his neck. The man was 
neither young nor old. He had been 
awake and conscious for forty 
years, thanks to the drug which 
made possible a kind of limited 
awareness. By the time the psy- 
chologists interrogated him, first 
for the proper authorities of the 
Instrumentality and later fj>r the 
news releases, it was plain enough 
that he thought the forty years 
were about a month. He never vol- 
unteered to sail back, because he 
had actually aged forty years. He 
was a young man, young in his 
hopes and wishes, but a man who 
had burned up a quarter of a hu- 
man lifetime in a single agoniz- 
ing experience. 

At this time Helen America 
went to Cambridge. Lady Joan’s 
College was the finest woman’s 
college in the Atlantic world. Cam- 
bridge had reconstructed its proto- 
historic traditions, and the neo- 
British had recaptured that fine 
edge of engineering which recon- 
nected their traditions with the 
earliest antiquity. 

Naturally enough the language 
was cosmopolite Earth and not ar- 
chaic English,, but the students 
were proud to live at a recon- 
structed university very much as 
the archeological evidence showed 

SOUL 63 



it to have been before the period 
of darkness and troubles came 
upon the Earth. 

Helen shone a little in this 
renaissance. 

IVEWS release services watched 

’ Helen in the cruelest possible 
fashion. They revived her name 
and the story of her mother. She 
had put in for six professions, and 
her last choice was sailor. It hap- 
pened that she was the first woman 
to make the application — first be- 
cause she was the only woman 
young enough to qualify who had 
also passed the scientific require- 
ments. 

Her picture was beside his on 
the screens before they ever met 
each other. 

Actually, she was not anything 
like that at all. She had suffered so 
much in her childhood from 
“Helen, Helen, fat and dumb” that 
she was competitive only on a 
coldly professional basis. She 
hated and loved and missed the 
mother she had lost, and she re- 
solved so fiercely not to be like 
her mother that she became an em- 
bodied antithesis of Mona. 

The mother had been horsy, 
blonde, big — the kind of woman 
who is a feminist because she is 
not very feminine. Helen never 
thought about her own femininity. 
She just worried about herself. Her 
face would have been round if it 
had been plump, but she was not 

64 



plump. Black-haired, dark-ey 
small and slim, she was a genetj 
demonstration of her unknowj 
father. Her teachers often fearei 
her. She was a pale, quiet girl, anj 
she always knew her subject. 

Her fellow-students had jokt) 
about her for a few weeks and thei 
most of them had banded togethq 
against the indecency of the press 
When a newsframe came out wifl] 
something ridiculous about the 
long-dead Mona, the whisper went 
through Lady Joan’s,- “Keep Helej 
away. Those people are at it again,' 

They protected her, and it wai 
only by chance that she saw ha 
own face in a newsframe. Then 
was the face of a man beside her 
He looked like a little old monkey 
she thought. Then she read, “per 
FECT GIRL WANTS TO BE A SAILOR 
SHOULD SAILOR HIMSELF DATI 
PERFECT GIRL?” Her cheeks burnei 
with old helpless embarrassmeit 
and rage, but she had grown too ex 
pert at being herself to do wha 
she might have done in her teens- 
hate the man. She knew it wasn’t 
his fault either. It wasn’t even th{ 
fault of the news services. She hac 
only to be herself, if she could evei 
find out what that really meant 

' I ■' HEIR dates, when they cam( 
had the properties of a night 
mare. A news service notifie( 
Helen that she had been awarded 
a week's holiday in New Madrid- 
with the sailor from the stars. 

GALAXt 



Helen refused. 

Then he refused too, and he was 
a little too prompt for her liking, 
ghe became curious about him. 

Two weeks passed, and in the 
office of the news service a treas- 
urer brought two slips of paper to 
the director. They were the vouch- 
ers for Helen America and Mr. 
Gray-no-more to obtain the utmost 
in preferential luxury at New 
Madrid. 

The treasurer said, “These have 
been issued and registered as gifts 
with the Instrumentality, sir. 
Should they be canceled?” 

The executive of the news serv- 
ice had his fill of stories that day, 
and he felt humane. On an impulse 
he commanded the treasurer, “Give 
those tickets to them again. No 
publicity. We’ll keep out of it. If 
they don’t want us, they don’t have 
to have us. Push it along. That’s 
all. Go.” 

The tickets went back out to 
rielen. She had made the highest 
record ever reported at the uni- 
versity and she needed a rest. 
When the news service woman 
gave her the ticket, she said, “Is 
this a trick?” 

Assured that it was not, she then 
asked, “Is that man coming?” 

She couldn’t say “the sailor”— 
it sounded too much like the way 
people had always talked about 
herself — and she honestly didn’t 
remember his other name at the 
moment. 

THE LADY W'HO SAILED THE 




The woman did not know. 

“Do I have to see him?” said 
Helen. 

“No,” said the woman. “The gift 
is unconditional.” 

Helen laughed, almost grimly. 
“All right. I’ll take it and say 
thanks. But one picturemaker — 
mind you, just one — and I walk 
out Or I may walk out for no rea- 
son at all. Is that all right?” 

It was. 

Four days later Helen was in 
the pleasure world of New Madrid, 
and a master of the dances was 
presenting her to an odd, intense 
old man whose hair was black. 

“Junior Scientist Helen Amer- 
ica — Sailor of the Stars Mr. Gray- 
no-more.” 

He looked at them shrewdly and 
smiled a kindly, experienced smile. 
He added the empty phrase of his 
profession, “I have had the honor 
and I withdraw.” 

They were alone together on the 
edge of the dining room. The sailor 
looked at her ve^ sharply indeed 
and then said, “Who are you? Are 
you somebody I have already 
met? Should I remember you? 
There are too many people here on 
Earth. What do we do next? What 
are we supposed to do? Would you 
like to sit down?” 

Helen said one “Yes” to all those 
questions and never dreamed that 
the single yes would be articulated 
by hundreds of great actresses, 
each one in the actress’s own spe- 

SOUL ' 65 



Fx 

f 



cial way, across the centuries to 
come. 

They did sit down. 

How the rest of it happened, 
neither one was ever quite sure. 

^HE had had to quiet him almost 
^ as though he were a hurt per- 
son in the House of Recovery. She 
explained the dishes to him, and 
when he still could not choose, she 
gave the robot selections for him. 
She warned him, kindly enough, 
about manners when he forgot the 
simple ceremony of eating which 
everyone knows, such as standing 
up to unfold the napkin or putting 
the scraps into the solvent tray and 
the silverware into the transfer. 

At last he relaxed and did not 
look so old. 

Momentarily forgetting the 
thousand times she had been asked 
silly questions herself, she asked 
him, “Why did you become a 
sailor?” 

He stared at her in open-eyed 
inquiry, as though she had spoken 
to him in an unknown language 
and expected a reply. Finally he 
mumbled the answer, “Are you — 
you, too — saying that — that I 
shouldn’t have done it?” 

Her hand went to her mouth in 
instant apology. “No, no, no. You 
see, I myself have put in to be a 
sailor.” 

He looked at her, his young-old 
eyes open wide. He did not stare, 
but merely seemed to be trying to 



1 



understand words, each one of 
which he could comprehend indi, 
vidually but which in sum 
amounted to sheer madness. She 
did not turn away from his look, 
odd though it was. Once again, she 
had the chance to note the inde- 
scribable peculiarity of this man 
who had managed enormous sails 
out in the blind, empty black be- 
tween untwinkling stars. 

He was young as a boy. The hair i 
which gave him his name was 
glossy black. His beard must have i 
been removed pernaanently, be-^ 
cause his skin was like that of a 
middle-aged woman — well-kept,^ 
pleasant, but showing the unmis- 
takable wrinkles of age and be- 
traying no sign of normal stubble. 
The skin had age without experi-i 
ence. The muscles had grown 
older, but they did not show how 
the person had grown. 

Helen had learned to be an 
acute observer of people as her 
mother took up with one fanatic 
after another; she knew that peo- 
ple carry their secret biographies 
written in the muscles of their 
faces, and that a stranger passing 
on the street tells us (whether he 
wishes to or not) all his inmost in- 
timacies. If we but look sharply 
enough, and in the right light, we 
know whether fear or hope or 
amusement has tallied the hours 
of his days, we divine the sources 
and outcome of his most secret 
sensuous pleasures, we catch the

dim but persistent reflections of 
those other people who have left 
the imprints of their personality on 
him in turn. 

All this was absent from Mr. 
Gray-no-more. 

TTE had age but not the stig- 
mata of age; he had growth 
without the normal markings of 
growth; he had lived without living, 
in a time and world in which most 
people stayed yoxmg while living 
too much. 

He was the uttermost opposite 
to her mother that Helen had ever 
seen, and with a pang of undi- 
rected apprehension Helen real- 
ized that this man meant a great 
deal to her futme life, whether she 
wished him to or not. She saw in 
him a young bachelor, premature- 
ly old, a man whose love had been 
given to emptiness and horror, not 
to the tangible rewards and dis- 
appointments of human life. 

He had had all space for his mis- 
tress, and space had used him 
harshly. Still young, he was old; al- 
ready old, he was young. 

The mixture was one which she 
knew that she had never seen be- 
fore, and which she suspected that 
no one else had ever seen, either. 
He had in the beginning of life the 
grief, compassion, and wisdom 
which most people find only at the 
end. 

It was he who broke the silence. 
“You did say — didn’t jjou?— that 

68 



you yoiu^elf had put in to be a 
sailor?” 

Even to herself, her answ 
sounded silly and girlish. “I’m the 
first woman ever to qualify with 
the necessary scientific subjects 
while still young enough to pass 
the physical ...” 

“You must be an unusual girl,” 
said he mildly. 

Helen realized, with a thrill, a 
sweet and bitterly real hope that' 
this young-old man from the stars' 
had never heard of the “perfect 
child” who had been laughed at in 
the moments of being born, the 
girl who had all America for a 
father, who was famous and un- 
usual and alone so terribly much 
so that she could not even imagine 
being ordinary, happy, decent, or 
simple. 

She thought to herself. It would 
take a wise freak who sails in from 
the stars to overlook who I am, but 
to him she simply said, “It’s no 
use talking about being ‘unusual.’ 
I’m tired of this Earth and since 
I don’t have to die to leave it, I 
think I would like to sail to the 
stars. I’ve got less to lose than you 
may think . .” She was about to 
tell him about Mona Muggeridge, 
but she stopped in time. 



The compassionate gray eyes 
were upon her, and at this point 
it was he, not she, who was in con- 
trol of the situation. She looked at 
the eyes themselves. They had 
stayed open for forty years, in the 



GALAXY 



blackness near to pitch darkness 
of the tiny cabin. TTie dim dials 
had shone like blazing suns upon 
his tired retinas before he was able 
to turn his eyes away. From time 
to time he had looked out at the 
black nothing to see the silhouettes 
of his dials, almost blackness 
against total blackness, as the miles 
of their sweep sucked up the push 
of light itself and accelerated him 
and his frozen cargo at almost im- 
measurable speeds across an ocean 
of unfathomable silence. Yet what 
he had done, she had asked to do. 

The stare of his gray eyes 
yielded to a smile of his lips. In 
that young-old face, masculine in 
structure and feminine in texture, 
the smile had a connotation of tre- 
mendous kindness. She felt singu- 
larly much like weeping when she 
saw him smile in that particular 
way at her. Was that what people 
learned between the stars? To care 
for other people very much indeed 
and to spring upon them only to 
love and not to devour? 

TN a measured voice he said, “I 
believe you. You’re the first 
one that I have believed. All these 
people have said that they wanted 
to be sailors too, even when they 
looked at me. They could not know 
what it means, but they said it any- 
how, and I hated them for saying 
it. You, though — perhaps you will 
sail among the stars, but I hope 
that you will not” 

THE LADY WHO SAILED THE 



As though waking from a dream, 
he looked around the luxurious 
room, with the gilt-and-enamel ro- 
bot-waiters standing aside with 
negligent elegance. They were de- 
signed to be always present and 
never obtrusive: TTiis was a diffi- 
cult esthetic effect to achieve, but 
their designer had achieved it. 

The rest of the evening moved 
with the inevitability of good 
music. He went with her to the for- 
ever-lonely beach which the archi- 
tects of New Madrid had built be- 
side the hotel. They talked a little, 
they looked at each other, and they 
made love with an affirmative cer- 
tainty which seemed outside them- 
selves. He was very tender, and he 
did not realize that in a genetically 
sophisticated society, he was the 
first lover she had ever wanted or 
had ever had. (How could the 
daughter of Mona Muggeridge 
want a lover or a mate or child?) 

On the next afternoon, she exer- 
cised the freedom of her time and 
asked him to marry her. They had 
gone back to their private beach, 
which, through miracles of ultra- 
fine mini-weather adjustment, 
brought a Pol3mesian afternoon to 
the high, chilly plateau of central 
Spain. 

She asked him, she did, to marry 
her, and he had refused, as tender- 
ly and as kindly as a boy of twenty 
aged sixty can refuse a girl of 
eighteen. She did not press him; 
they continued the love affair. 

SOUL 



69 



They sat on the artificial sand of 
the artificial beach and dabbled 
their toes in the man-warmed 
water of the ocean. Then they lay 
down against an artificial sand 
dime which hid New Madrid from 
view. 

“Tell me,” Helen said, “may I 
ask again, why did you become a 
sailor?” 

“Not so easily answered,” he 
said. “Adventure, maybe, at least 
in part. And I wanted to see Earth. 
Couldn’t afford to come in a pod. 
Now — well, IVe enough to keep 
me the rest of my life. I can go 
back to New Earth as a passenger 
in a month instead of forty years— 
be frozen in no more time than the 
wink of an eye, put in my adia- 
batic pod, linked to the next sail- 
ing ship, and wake up home again 
while some other fool does the 
sailing.” 

Helen nodded. She did not 
bother to tell him that she knew all 
this. 

“Out where you sail among the 
stars,” she said, “can you tell me— 
can you possibly tell me anjrthing 
of what it’s like out there?” 

His face looked inward on his 
soul and afterward his voice came 
as from an immense distance. 
“There are moments — or is it 
weeks? You can’t really tell in the 
sail ship — when it seems — worth 
while. You feel — your nerve end- 
ings reach out imtil they touch the 
stars. You feel enormous.” 



^ RADUALLY he came back to 
her. “It’s trite to say, of course, 
but you’re never the same again. 
I don’t mean just the obvious phy. 
sical thing, but — you find your- 
self — or maybe you lose yourself. 
That’s why,” he continued, gestur- 
ing toward New Madrid, out of 
sight behind the sand dune, “I can’t 
stand this. New Earth — well, it’s 
like Earth must have been in the 
old days, I guess. There’s some- 
thing fresh about it. Here . .” 

“I know,” said Helen America, 
and she did. The slightly decadent, 
slightly corrupt, too comfortable air 
of Earth must have had a stifling 
effect on the man from beyond the 
stars. 

“There,” he said, “you won’t be- 
lieve this, but sometimes the 
ocean’s actually too cold to swim 
in. We have music that doesn’t 
come from machines, and pleas- 
ures that come from inside our own 
bodies without being put there. I 
have to get back to New Earth,” he 
said. 

Helen said nothing for a little 
while, concentrating on stilling the 
pain in her heart. “I — I — ” she 
began. 

“I know!” he said, almost sav- 
agely turning on her. “But I can’t 
take you! You’re too young; you’ve 
got a life to live and I’ve thrown 
away a quarter of mine. No, that’s 
not right. I didn’t throw it away. 
I wouldn’t trade it back because 
it’s given me something inside that 

GALAXY 



70 



I never had before. And it’s given 
me you-” 

“But if—” she started again to 
argue. 

“No. Don’t spoil it. I’m going 
next week to be frozen in my pod 
to wait the next sail ship. I can’t 
stand much more of this and I 
might weaken. That would be a 
terrible mistake. But we have this 
time together now, and we have 
our separate lifetimes to remem- 
ber in. Don’t think of anything 
else. There’s nothing else, nothing 
we can do.” 

Helen did not tell him — then or 
ever — of the child they would now 
never have. She could have tied 
him to her with it, for he was an 
honorable man and would have 
married her, had she told him. But 
Helen, even then in her youth, 
wanted him to come to her of his 
own free will. To that marriage 
their child would have been an ad- 
ditional blessing. 

There was the other alternative, 
of course. She could have borne 
the child without naming the 
father. But she was no Mona Mug- 
geridge. She knew too well the 
terror and loneliness of being a 
Helen America ever to be respon- 
sible for creating another. And for 
the course she had laid out, there 
was no place for a child. So, at the 
end of their time in New Madrid, 
she let him say a real good-by. 
Wordless and without tears, she 
left. 



Then she went up to an arctic 
city, a pleasure city where such 
carelessnesses are known to hap- 
pen, and a confidential medical 
service eliminated the unborn 
child. Then she went back to Cam- 
bridge and confirmed her place as 
the first woman to sail a ship to 
the stars. 

V 

^1 ''HE Presiding Lord of the In- 
strumentality at that time was 
a man named Waite. Waite was 
not cruel; he had a job that left 
no room for anything but efficien- 
cy. 

His aide said to him, “This girl 
wants to sail a ship to New Earth. 
Are you going to let her?” 

‘Why not?” said Waite. “If she 
fails, we will find out something 
eighty years from now, when the 
ship comes back. Don’t give fier 
any convicts, though. Convicts are 
too valuable as settlers to be sent 
on a gamble. Give her fartatics. 
Don’t you have twenty or thirty 
thousand who are waiting?” 

“Yes, sir, twenty-six thousand 
two hundred. Not counting recent 
additions.” 

“Very well,” said the Lord of the 
Instrumentality, “give her the 
whole lot of them and assign her 
that new ship. Have we named it?” 

“No, sir,” said the aide. 

“Name it.” 

The aide looked blank. 



THE LADY WHO SAILED THE SOUL 



71 



A contemptuous wise smile 
crossed the face of the senior bu- 
reaucrat He said, “All right, then- 
name it the Soul — and let the Soul 
fly to the stars. And let Helen 
America be an angel if she wants 
to. Poor thing, she hasn't had much 
of a life on this Earth, not the way 
she was bom and brought up. And 
it’s no use to try and reform her, 
to transform her personality, when 
it’s a lively, rich personality. It 
does not do any good. We don’t 
have to punish her for being her- 
self. Let her go. Let her have what 
she wants.” 

Waite sat up and stared at his 
aide and then repeated very firm- 
ly: “Let her have what she wants 
— but only if she qualifies.” 

VI 

TTELEN America did qualify. 

The doctors and the experts 
tried to warn her against it. 

One technician said: “Don’t you 
realize what this is going to mean? 
Forty years will pour out of your 
life in a single month. You leave 
here a girl. You will get there a 
woman of sixty. There will be 
about thirty thousand pods stnmg 
on sixteen lines behind you, and 
you will have the control cabin to 
live in. We will give you as many 
robots as you need, probably a 
dozen. You will have a main sail 
and a foresail and you will have 
to keep the two of them.”

“I know. I have read the book," 
said Helen America. “And I sail 
the ship with li^t, and if the infra, 
red touches that sail, I go. If I get 
radio interference, I pull the sails 
in. And if the sails fail, I wait as i 
long as I live.” \ 

The technician looked a little ' 
cross. “There is no call for you to 
get tragic about it Tragedy is easy 
enough to contrive. And if you 
want to be tragic, you can do it 
without destroying thirty thousand 
other people or wasting a large 
amount of Earth cargo and ship- 
ping. You can drown right here, or 
jump into a volcano, or get into an 
accident. Tragedy is not the hard 
part. The hard part is when you 
don’t quite succeed and you have 
to keep on fighting. When you 
must keep going on and on and on 
in the face of really hopeless odds. 

“Now this is the way the fore- 
sail works. That sail will be twenty 
thousand miles at the wide part 
It tapers down and the total length 
will be just imder 80,000 miles. It 
will be retracted or extended by 
small servo-robots. The servo-ro- 
bots are radio-controlled. You had 
better use your radio sparingly, be- 
cause these batteries have to last 
forty years. They have got to keep 
you alive.” 

“Yes, sir,” said Helen America 
very contritely. 

“You’ve got to remember what 
your job is. You’re going because 
a sailor takes a lot less weight than 

GALAXY 



a machine. There is no all-purpose 
computer built that weighs as little 
as you do. You go simply because 
you are expendable. Anyone who 
goes out to the stars takes one 
chance in three of never getting 
there. But you are not going be- 
cause you are a leader. You are 
going because you are young, be- 
cause you qualify intellectually 
and academically — because your 
nerves are good. You understand 
that?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Any questions?” 

“No, sir.” 

“Furthermore, you are going be- 
cause you’ll make the trip in forty 
years. If we send automatic de- 
vices and have them manage the 
sails, they would get there — pos- 
sibly. But it would take them a 
hundred years or more, and by that 
time the adiabatic p)od would have 
spoiled, most of the human cargo 
would not be fit for revival, and 
the leakage of heat would be 
enough to ruin the entire expedi- 
tion. So remember that the tragedy 
and the trouble you face is mostly 
work. Work, and that’s all it is. 
That is your big job.” 

Helen smiled. She was a short 
girl with rich dark hair, brown 
eyes, and very pronounced eye- 
brows, but when Helen smiled she 
looked almost like a child again, 
and a rather charming one. She 
said: “My job is work. I under- 
stand that, sir.” 

THE LADY WHO SAILED THE 



VII 

¥N the preparation area, the 
^ make-ready was fast but not 
hurried. Twice the technicians 
urged her to take a holiday before 
she reported for final training. She 
did not accept their advice. She 
wanted to go forth; she knew that 
they knew she wanted to leave 
Earth forever, and she also knew 
they knew she was not merely her 
mother’s daughter. She was trying, 
somehow, to be herself. She knew 
the world did not believe, but the 
world did not matter. 

The third time they suggested a 
vacation, the suggestion was man- 
datory. She had a gloomy two 
months which she ended up enjoy- 
ing a little bit on the wonderful 
islands of the Hesperides, islands 
which were raised when the weight 
of the earthports caused a new 
group of small archipelagoes to 
form below Bermuda. 

She reported back, fit, healthy, 
and ready to go. 

The senior medical officer was 
very blunt. “Do you really know 
what we are going to do to you? 
We are going to make you live for- 
ty years out of your life in one 
month.” 

She nodded, and he went on, 
“Now to give you those forty years 
we’ve got to slow down your bodily 
processes. After all, the sheer bio- 
logical task of breathing forty 
years’ worth of air in one month 

SOUL 73 



involves a factor of about five hun- 
dred to one. No lungs could stand 
it. Your body must circulate water. 
It must take in food. Most of this 
is going to be protein. There will 
be some kind of a hydrate. You’ll 
need vitamins. 

“Now, what we are going to do 
is slow the brain down, very much 
indeed, so that the brain will be 
working at about that five-hundred- 
to-one ratio. We don’t want you in- 
capable of working. Somebody has 
to manage the sails. 

“Therefore, if you hesitate or 
start to think, a thought or two is 
going to take several weeks. Mean- 
while your body can be slowed 
down some. But the different parts 
can’t be slowed down at the same 
rate. Water, for example, we 
brought down to about eighty to 
one, food to about three hundred 
to one. 

“You won’t have time to drink 
forty years’ worth of water. We 
circulate it, get it through, purify 
it, and get it back in your system, 
unless you break your link-up. 

“So what you face is a month of 
being absolutely wide awake, on 
an operating table and being oper- 
ated on without anesthetic, while 
doing some of the hardest work 
that mankind has ever found.” 

Tj^HITE of face, she nodded 
again when he paused, and 
again he continued. 

“You’ll have to take observa- 

74 



tions. You’ll have to watch your 
lines with the pods of people and 
cargo behind you. You’ll have to 
adjust the sails. If there is anybody 
surviving at your destination point, 
they will come out and meet you. 

“At least that happens most of 
the times. 

“I am not going to assiue you 
you will get the ship in, and if they 
don’t meet you, take an orbit be- 
yond the furthest planet and either 
let yourself die or try to save your- 
self. You can’t get thirty thousand 
people down on a planet single- 
handedly. 

“Meanwhile, though, you’ve got 
a real job. We are going to have to 
build these controls right into your 
body. We’ll start by putting valves 
in your chest arteries. Then we 
catheter ize you. We are going to 
make an artificial colostomy that 
will go forward here, just in front 
of your hip joint. Your water intake 
has a certain psychological value, 
so that about one five-himdredth 
of your water we are going to leave 
you to, drink out of a cup. The rest 
of it is going to go directly into 
your blood stream. Again about a 
tenth of your food will go that way. 
You understand that?” 

“You mean,” said Helen, “I eat 
one-tenth, and the rest goes in in- 
travenously?” 

“That’s right,” said the medical 
technician. “We will pump it into 
you. The concentrates are there. 
The reconstituter is there. Now 

GALAXY 



these lines have a double connec- 
tion. One set of connections runs 
into the maintenance machine. 
That will become the logistic sup- 
port for your body. And these lines 
are the umbilical cord for a human 
being alone among the stars. They 
are your life. 

“If they should break or if you 
should fall, you might faint for a 
year or two. If that happens, your 
local system takes over: that’s the 
pack on your back. 

“On Earth, it weighs as much as 
you do. You have already been 
drilled with the model pack. You 
know how easy it is to handle in 
space. That’ll keep you going for 
a subjective period of about two 
hours. No one has ever worked out 
a clock yet that would match the 
human mind, so, instead of giving 
you a clock, we are giving you an 
odometer attached to your own 
pulse and we mark it off in grades. 
If you watch it in terms of ten- 
thousands of pulse beats, you may 
get some information out of it. I 
don’t know what kind of informa- 
tion, but you may find it helpful 
somehow.” 

Helen nodded. 

He looked at her sharply and 
then turned back to his tools, pick- 
ing up a shining needle with a disk 
on the end. 

“Now, let’s get back to this. We 
are going to have to get right into 
your mind. That is a chemical 
too.” 

THE LADY WHO SAILED THE 



IT ELEN interrupted. “You said 
you were not going to oper- 
ate on my head.” 

“Just the needle. That’s the only 
way we can get to the mind. Slow 
it down enough so that you will 
have this subjective mind operat- 
ing at a rate that will make the 
forty years pass in a month.” He 
smiled grimly, but the grimness 
changed to momentary tenderness 
as he took in her brave, obstinate 
stance, her girlish, admirable, piti- 
able determination. 

“I won’t argue it,” she said. “This 
is as bad — and as good — as a 
marriage, and the stars are my 
bridegroom.” The image of the 
sailor went across her mind, but 
sh^ said nothing of him. 

The technician went on, “We 
have already built in psychotic ele- 
ments. You’ll have to be insane to 
manage the sails and to survive ut- 
terly alone and be out there even 
a month. And the trouble is, in that 
month you are going to know it’s 
really forty years. There is not a 
mirror in the place, but you’ll prob- 
ably find shiny surfaces to look at 
yourself. 

“You will see yourself aging, 
every time you slow down to look. 
I don’t know what the problem is 
going to be on that score. It’s been 
bad enough on men. 

“Your hair problem is going to 
be easier than men’s. With the 
sailors we sent out, we simply had 
to kill all the hair roots. Other- 

SOUL 75 



wise the men would have been 
swamped in their own beards. And 
a tremendous amoimt of the nu- 
trient would be wasted if it went 
into raising of hair on the face. I 
think what we will do is inhibit 
hair on the top of your head. 
Whether it comes out the same 
color or not is something you will 
find for yourself later. Did you 
ever happ>en to meet the sailor who 
came in?” 

The doctor knew she had. He 
did not know that it was the sailor 
from beyond the stars who called 
her. 

Helen managed to remain 
composed as she smiled at him to 
say: “Your technician planted a 
new scalp. The hair came out black 
and he got the nickname of Mr. 
Gray-no-more.” 

“If you are ready next Tuesday, 
we’ll be ready too. Do you think 
you can possibly make it by then, 
my lady?” 

Helen felt odd seeing this old, 
serious man refer to her as “lady,” 
but she knew he was paying respect 
to a profession and not just to an 
individual. 

“Tuesday is time enough.” She 
felt complimented that he was old- 
fashioned enough to know the an- 
cient names of the days of the week 
and to use them. That was a sign 
that he had not only learned the 
essentials at the university but that 
he had picked up the elegant in- 
consequentials as well. 



VIII 

' I ''WO weeks later was twenty- 
one years later by the chron- 
ometers in the cabin. Helen turned 
for the ten-thousandth-times-ten- 
thousand time to scan the sails. 

Her back ached with a violent 
throb. 

She could feel the steady roar 
of her heart like a fast vibrator as 
it ticked against the time-span of 
her awareness. She could look 
down at the meter on her wrist and 
see the hands on the dials indicate 
tens of thousands of pulses very 
slowly. 

She heard the steady whistle of 
air in her throat as her lungs 
seemed shuddering with sheer 
speed. 

And she felt the throbbing pain 
of a large tube feeding water di- 
rectly into her neck. 

Her abdomen felt as though 
someone had built a fire there. The 
evacuation tube operated auto- 
matically, but it burned as if a 
coal had been held to her skin, and 
a catheter, which connected her 
bladder to another tube, stung as 
savagely as the prod of a scalding- 
hot needle. 

Her head ached and her vision 
blurred. 

But she could still see the in- 
struments and she still could watch 
the sails. Now and then she could 
glimpse, faint as a tracery of dust, 
the immense skein of people and 

GALAXY 



cargo that lay behind the sails. 

She could not sit down. 

The only way that she could be 
comfortable was to lean against 
the instrument panel, her lower 
ribs against the panel, her tired 
forehead against the meters. 

Once she rested that way and 
realized that it was two and a half 
months before she got up. She 
knew that rest had no meaning, 
and she could see her face moving, 
a distorted image of her own face 
growing old in the reflections from 
the glass face of the “apparent 
weight” dial. She could look at her 
arms with blurring vision, note the 
skin tightening, loosening and 
tightening again as changes in tem- 
peratures affected it. 

She looked out one more time at 
the sails and decided to take in the 
foresail. Wearily she dragged her- 
self over the control panel with a 
servo-robot She selected the right 
control and opened it for a week 
or so. She waited there, her heart 
buzzing, her throat whistling air. 
Finally she checked to see if the 
control really had been the right 
one, pushed again, and nothing 
happened. 

She pushed a third time. There 
was no response. 

Now she went back to the mas- 
ter panel, re-read, checked the light 
direction, found a certain amount 
of infra-red pressure which she 
should have been picking up. The 
sails had very gradually risen to 

THE LADY WHO SAILED THE 



something not far from the speed 
of light itself because they moved 
fast with the one side dulled; the 
pods behind, sealed against time 
and eternity, swam obediently in 
an almost perfect weightlessness. 

Her reading had been correct 

The sail was wrong. 

She went back to the emergency 
panel and pressed. Nothing hap- 
pened. 

^HE broke out a repair robot 
and sent it out to effect re- 
pairs, pimching the papers as rapid- 
ly as she could, to give instructions. 
The robot went out and an instant 
(three days) later it replied. The 
panel on the repair robot rang 
forth, “Does not conform.” 

She sent a second repair robot. 
That had no effect either. 

She sent a third, the last. Three 
bright lights. “Does not conform” 
started at her. She moved the 
servo-robots to the other side of 
the sails and pulled hard. 

The sail was still not at the right 
angle. 

She stood there wearied and lost 
in space, and she prayed. She 
thought she had prayed very fer- 
vently and she hoped that she 
would get an answer to her prayer. 

It did not work out that way. 
She was bewildered, alone. 

There was no sun. There was 
nothing except the tiny cabin and 
herself, more alone than any wom- 
an had ever been before. She 

SOUL 



76

sensed the thrill and ripple of her 
muscles as they went through days 
of adjustment while her mind no- 
ticed only the matter of minutes. 
She leaned forward, forced herself 
not to relax, and finally she remem- 
bered that one of the official busy- 
bodies had included a weapon. 

What she would use a weapon 
for, she did not know. 

It pointed. It had a range of two 
hundred thousand miles. The tar- 
get could be selected automati- 
cally. 



She got down on her knees trail- 
ing the abdominal tube and the 
feeding tube and the catheter tubes 
and the helmet wires, each one run- 
ning back to the panel. She crawled 
underneath the panel for the servo- 
robots and she pulled out a written 
manual. She finally found the right 
frequency for the weapon’s con- 
trols. She set the weapon up and 
went to the window. 

At the last moment she thought, 
“Perhaps the fools are going to 
make me shoot the window out. It 

XY 



ought to have been designed to 
shoot through the window without 
hurting it. That’s the way they 
should have done it.” 

She wondered about the matter 
for a week or two. 

Just before she fired, she turned. 
There, next to her, stood her sailor 
from the stars, Mr. Gray-no-more. 
He said : “It won’t work that way.” 
He stood clear and handsome, 
the way she had seen him in New 
Madrid. He had no tubes, he did 
not tremble, she could see the nor- 



mal rise and fall of his chest as he 
took one breath every hour or so. 
One part of her mind knew that he 
was a hallucination. Another part 
of her mind believed that he was 
real. She was mad, and she was 
very happy to be mad at this time, 
and she let the hallucination give 
her advice. She re-set the gun so 
that it would fire through the cabin 
wall, and it fired a low charge at 
the repair mechanism out beyond 
the distorted and immovable sail. 

The low charge did the trick. 

79 



THE LADY WHO SAILED THE SOUL 



78 



The interference had been some- 
thing beyond all technical antici- 
pation. The weapon had cleaned 
out the forever-unidentifiable ob- 
struction, leaving the servo-robots 
free to attack their tasks like a tribe 
of maddened ants. They worked 
again. They had had defenses built 
in against the minor impediments 
of space. All of them scurried and 
skipped about 

With a sense of bewilderment 
close to religion, she perceived the 
wind of starlight blowing against 
the immense sails. The sails 
snapped into position. She got a 
momentary touch of gravity as she 
sensed a little weight. The Soul 
was back on her course.

ffTT’S a girl,” they said to him 
on New Earth. “It’s a girl. 
She must have been eighteen or 
twenty when she left Earth.” 

Mr. Gray-no-more did not be- 
lieve it. 

But he went to the hospital and 
there in the hospital he saw Helen 
America. 

“Here I am, sailor,” said she. “I 
sailed too.” Her face was white as 
chalk, her expression that of a girl 
of about twenty, body that of a 
well-preserved woman of sixty. 

As for him, he had not changed 
again, since he had returned home 
inside a pod. 

His eyes narrowed, and then, in 

80 



a sudden reversal of roles, it was 
he who was kneeling beside her bed 
and covering her hands with his 
tears. 

Half-coherently, he babbled at 
her : “I ran away from you because 
I loved you so. I came back here 
where you would never follow, or if 
you did follow, you’d still be a 
young woman, and I’d still be too 
old. But you sailed here and you 
wanted me.” 

The nurse of New Earth did not 
know about the rules which should 
be applied to sailors from the stars. 
Very quietly she went out of the 
room. But she was a practical 
woman. She called a friend of hers 
at the news service and said: “If 
you get over here fast, you can get 
the scoop on Helen America and. 
Mr. Gray-no-more. They just met 
like that and fell in love.” 

The nurse did not know that 
they had foresworn a love on Earth. 
The nurse did not know that Helen 
America had made a lonely trip 
with an icy purpose, and the nurse 
did not know that the crazy image 
of Mr. Gray-no-more, the sailor 
himself, had stood beside Helen 
twenty years out from nothing-at- 
all in the depth and blackness of 
space between the stars.

T he little girl had grown up,

little girl of her own. The mother

was imchanged, but the spieltier 
was very, very old. It had outlived 
all its marvelous tricks of adapta- 
bility, and for some years had 
stayed frozen in the role of a yel- 
low-haired, blue-eyed girl doll. Out 
of sentimental sense of the fitness 
of things, she had dressed the spiel- 
tier in a bright blue jumper with 
matching panties. The little animal 
creprt; softly across the floor on its 
tiny human hands, using its knees 
for hind feet. The mock-hiunan 
face looked up blindly and 
squeaked for milk. 

The young mother said, “Mom, 
you ought to get rid of that thing. 
It’s all used up and it looks hor- 
rible with your nice period furni- 
ture.” 

“I thought you loved it,” said 
the older woman. 

“It was cute when I was a child, 
but I’m not a child any more, and 
it doesn’t even work.” 

The spieltier had struggled to its 
feet and clutched its mistress’s 
ankle. The older woman took it 
away gently, and put down a sau- 
cer of milk and a cup the size of a 
thimble. The spieltier tried to 
courtsey, as it had been motivated 
to do at the beginning, slipped, fell, 
and whimpered. The mother 
righted it and the little old animal- 
toy began dipping milk with its 
thimble and sucking the milk into 
its tiny, toothless old mouth.

“You remember. Mom—” said 
the younger woman, and stopped. 
“Remember what, dear?” 

“You told me about Helen 
America and Mr. Gray-no-more 
when that was brand-new.” 

“Yes, darling, maybe I did.” 
“You didn’t tell me everything,” 
said the younger woman accusing- 
ly. 

“Of course not. You were a 
child.” 

“But it was awful. Those messy 
people, and the horrible way 
sailors lived. I don’t see how you 
idealized it and called it a ro- 
mance—” 

“But it was. It is.” 

“Romance, my foot,” said the 
daughter. “It’s as bad as you and 
the worn-out spieltier.” She pointed 
at the tiny, living, aged doll who 
had fallen asleep beside its milk. 
“I think it’s horrible. You ought 
to get rid of it. And the worlds 
ought to get rid of sailors.” 

“Don’t be harsh, darling,” said 
the mother. 

“Don’t be a sentimental old 
slob,” said the daughter. 

“Perhaps we are,” said the 
mother with a little loving sort of 
lax^h. 

Unobtrusively, she put the 
sleeping spieltier on a padded chair 
where it would not be stepped on 
or hurt.

On their last afternoon, I was

a specimen-collecting tour of the

jjjai a target for sneering at, was 
jjecause of my muscles. I could 
jjandle the long specimen trailer 
and heave boulders about more 
easily than the others. 

“Do not sneer at Morris, gentle-

The other three, Lee, Burns and 
John, were about six feet tall, slim, 
dark haired and handsome. But we 
were collecting specimens, not run- 
ning for Miss Earth 2430. My 
extra seven inches in height ex- 
tends more or less proportionately 
in my reach and thickness of shoul-

at being expelled, so I let them sit 
in the shade of the trailer while I 
set up the specimen plates and 
power unit, minima stand here, 
maxima stand there, controls on 
the sand beside them. 

“I don’t expect you’ve done this 
elementary stuff for a couple of 
years,” I said. “So . don’t walk 
on the plates and don’t touch the 
dial or the red and blue buttons.” 
“Hell, Morry, we know.” 

“Okay, okay. Only it’s more

on Earth was allowed a whole room

the Planetary Salvager, and the

people like that. But David Adam 
Smith had to have a complete des- 
ert. He ruled from the Holiday 
Probable centers of Reno to the 
gambling computers of Las Vegas, 
where the bubble dancer had come 
from. 

I put a single grain of sand on 
the minima plate and stood clear. 

“Press the blue button. Bums.” 

Burns wasn’t even listening. 

“Burns,” I repeated. 

“Hell, Morry, who cares about 
these damned specimens? How 
would you like to be expelled? No 
classification, no chance of a job, 
spend the rest of your life in a com- 
pulsory Holiday Reservation.” 

“How does he get away with it,” 
muttered Lee, looking around at 
the open desert and the bare hills 
on the skyline. “Tomorrow we’ll be 
back in a ten-to-a-room bachelor 
tmit in the Nebraska suburbs, with 
a fine view of continuous rooftops 
to the Gulf, the Atlantic and the 
Great Lakes, and the nearest geo- 
logical specimen at the bottom of 
the community hydroponic tanks. 
And here he is — the only David

John Thay shook his head. 

“That’s just emotional reaction,

Missing. Probably in a sodden stu- 
por in one of the South American 
City-States. I tell you, science can- 
not produce anything in labora- 
tories. Science must have room to 
breathe!’ ” 

It was a stock student’s speech. 

I waited for the other two to 
round it off. 

“And why. Professor Smith,” 
said Burns imitating a heavy offi- 
cial voice, “have you alone retained 
your faculties?” 

“Because, dear sir,” Lee an- 
swered in David Adam Smith’s 
thin voice, “I never admit more 
than three hundred students to the 
Institute. And because apparently 
I have the only mind capable of 
absorbing the weight of modern 
knowledge without much strain.”

“You do not dislike yourse! 
Professor.” 

“I give credit where it is due, 
dear sir.” Lee stopped and contiu.i 
ued in his normal voice. “The 
trouble is, he does produce the 
stuff. He’s supposed to be a geolo- 
gist, but there hasn’t been an in. 
vention for the last decade that he 
didn’t master-mind.” 

“Pity he can’t think of some way 
of speeding up the emigration," 
John said. “If only we could leave 
Earth!” 

T WALKED over and pressed 
the blue button myself. 

The grain of sand on the minima 
plate flicked out of our time-space: 
and reappeared on the maxima 
plate ten times larger. I picked it 
up and carried it back to the mini.* 
ma plate, repeated the process and 
went on until the grain of quartz 
was more than four feet long. 

“Why don’t you do it in one 
jump instead of walking backwards 
and forwards?” John Thay asked 
“Can’t,” I said. “It’s got to be a 
perfect model of the crystal lattice 
of quartz. If you calibrate it for too 
big a jump in size it gets distorted 
No one knows why.” 

“You don’t tell us, Morry. Hell, 
the marvel is that it works at alL" 
I threw the four-foot-long crystal 
over to John and he put it in the 
trailer, after nearly losing it on the 
slight breeze. It is difficult to dis- 
believe your eyes and remember

that sn overblown specimen has 
yery little more than its original 
weight. The grain of quartz was 
merely expanded. Its molecular 
gild nuclear structure stretched out 
in a magnified volume of space. It 
^as almost all holes, an open ar- 
rangement of spaces between the 
force points of its matter; a direct 
magnification of the original with- 
out any other change. 

We used these specimens in the 
Desert Institute because everyone 
could see the details of the crystal 
lattice for themselves, instead of 
having to use an electron micro- 
scope. It removed the practical dif- 
ficulties of the principle of inde- 
terminacy, David Adam Smith 
said. If light was too coarse to let 
him see the contents of a nucleus, 
he was damned well going to bring 
the nucleus up to a size where he 
could see it. And so he did, even- 
tually, with this apparatus. 

I was one of the very few stu- 
dents ever allowed to touch the ap- 
paratus, probably because he 
thought I was too dumb to do any- 
thing with it. There were several 
sets but they never left the Insti- 
tute. The world was not ready for 
them, he said. 

There was quite a lot of stuff that 
David Adam Smith kept to him- 
self in the Institute. Not because 
the world was unready, but simply 
because he didn’t think he would 
get itiaximum applause at that par- 
ticular time. He only produced in-

ventions at the right theatrical mo- 
ment David Adam Smith was 
quite a ham. 

I was not supposed to tell any- 
one how this apparatus worked, but 
the three of them sitting facing me 
in the shade were not going any- 
where after this. I didn’t think it 
mattered. If you are not chosen at 
birth for emigration within the Sys- 
tem, and if you also fail at the In- 
stitute or one of the dormitory-xmi- 
versities, you’re just an extra unit 
of overpopulation. 

T THOUGHT I’d give them 
something to think about in- 
stead of brooding over the bubble 
dancer and their expulsion. 

“Of course it works,” I said. “It’s 
only Einstein with a twist.” 

The three of them laughed. 

“No, really. You know the clocks 
that go out on every stellar-re- 
porter and come back to the Insti- 
tute with dope on the composition 
of this and that place in the 
Galaxy? You were advanced stu- 
dents, you must have sent them 
off every day, well, wasn’t the clock 
always slow when it returned?” 
“Against the dispatching room 
clock, of course it was,” John 
agreed. “And if there was enough 
spare material left on Earth to send 
people apart from emigrants, a man 
would be younger than his twin 
when he returned.” 

“Well,” I said, “that’s what hap- 
pens here, except that a specimen 

85 



goes out off a minima plate and 
comes back onto the maxima plate 
so fast that the time component is 
negligible. All that happens is that 
it gets moved outside the local 
space-time reference. It doesn’t ex- 
actly go anywhere, I suppose. But 
instead of consuming less time on 
this shift out and in again, the time 
stays constant and it reappears oc- 
cupying more space. And there you 
are, with a magnified version of the 
original.” 

There was a silence. 

“Have you ever put anything liv- 
ing on the plate, Morry?” 

I blushed. John had a knack of 
uncovering safely hidden facts. 

“Well, I did make a small mis- 
take once. A grasshopper got on the 
plate when I wasn’t looking. I was 
magnifying an alumino-silicate and 
a few seconds after I got the speci- 
men up to size, the grasshopper ap- 
peared in the middle of it. I had to 
reverse the specimen back to get 
it out. Meant picking the crystal off 
the plate fast, before the insect 
came through,, but I managed it.” 

‘Was it hurt?” 

“The grasshopper? No. A little 
stunned, maybe. But perfectly 
well.” 

I went back to the plates and 
started another quartz grain. John, 
Lee and Burns sat and gabbled to 
each other. 

“If the crystal lattice was ex- 
panded to start with . .” 

“Relative to its size, the crystal 



would be full of breathing holes . » 

“You could take in nutrient] 
through a lattice as big as that It 
would be relatively porous . .” 

“. molecular pressure ...” ! 

“. shift that battery and move: 
the galvanometer ...” 

“. take out most of the instru.ij 
ments and fake up the records from 
the previous trip . .” 

“If we weren’t being expelled [ 
this evening,” said John. [ 

They looked at me. 

“Are you sure about the grass-] 
hopper, Morry?” Bums asked. j 
I nodded. 

1 HAD no warning. I had just 
put a half-inch expanded grain] 
on the minima plate, when Lee 
White walked onto the maxima 
and Burns pressed the red button 
There was a flicker and White 
appeared, half an inch tall, in the 
middle of the expanded quartz 
crystal on the minima plate. He 
was able to move his arms. He 
seemed to be saying something that, 
amused him. I knocked Burns 
away from the controls, pressed the 
blue button, whisked the emprty 
crystal off the maxima plate as it 
came through and only just got it 
out of the way before Lee White 
reappeared on the maxima plate, 
his normal size again. 

‘Well, it works,” he said. 

“You crazy?” I yelled at him. 
“Just think,” Burns said, sitting 
up and holding his jaw. “The num- 
GALAXY

jjgj- of times we’ve watched this fel- 
ja pressing his red and blue but- 
tons, and dismissed it as elementary 
atuff for beginners.” 

They calmed me down and 
apologized for doing a thing like 
that. Hell, I would have been ex- 
pelled too if I had gone back to the 
Institute with one of them missing. 
Pavid Adam Smith had a very 
elaborate hearing aid, but it never 
enabled him to hear excuses. Stu- 
dents only on Institute property, 
no readmittance for expelled stu- 
dents — and certainly no expelled 
students locked up in a lab speci- 
men. 

I suppose they would have 
thought it funny to sit in a crystal 
and make faces at David Adam 
Smith. They were wild, all three 
of them, and had been since they 
were admitted. I had no desire to 
be expelled with them. 

“You’re not going to be expelled, 
Morry. Not if you do as we ask.” 
“And if you don’t,” Burns said, 
still rubbing his jaw, “we’ll tell the 
dear Director that you explained 
how his specimen collector works.” 
“Then you’ll be expelled with us, 
Morry.” 

“He’s going to get tired of hav- 
ing you around to laugh at one day, 
Morry. Then you’ll be out any- 
way.” 

“No use appealing to him with 
the broad theme, I suppose?” 

I look at John Thay. 

“What broad theme?” I asked. 



“Do you know what you’ve got 
here, Morry? You have the only 
mass escape route from E^rth.” 
“You’re euphoricked!” 

“No, we’re not. Do you know 
how many habitable planets we’ve 
listed? Over three hundred and fif- 
ty. We’ve sent stellar-reporters out 
and back every day and we know. 
They’re listed back there at the 
Institute. We can reach them on 
the hs^perspace transmitter, you 
knoA^ that. The only things that 
stop a mass emigration are David 
Adam Smith, the small size of the 
transmitter and the impossibility of 
building enough ships to carry 
everyone. The alloy supply only 
just covers the standard emigra- 
tion program. But a stellar-reporter 
comes back with the data, is re-set 
and goes out again and comes back 
again. Don’t you see, Morry?” 
“No,” I said, “I don’t.” 

“Look. If you can use the same 
ship over and over again, the short- 
age of alloys doesn’t matter pro- 
vided you can build the first ship.” 
“Okay,” I said, “but a stellar-re- 
porter isn’t a ship, unless you’re a 
two foot midget and . .” 

I stopped. 

If Lee White could get in and 
out of a crystal safely — and he 
seemed to be unchanged after hav- 
ing just done so — he could travel 
inside a stellar -reporter with the 
other delicate mechanisms. 

I had never been promoted to 
those classes, but I knew the stel-

r 

1 )ar-reporters were baby rockets 
I that gouged specimens from the 
I planets they were sent to, meas- 
I ured, recorded, and brought them- 
jelves back on the same tracker 
path. When they were not burned 
up in stars, that is. 

But if the three of them were 
willing to take that chance, I was 
not going to get in the way. 

“I may not be as bright as you 
three,” I said. “But even I can see 
you may have something here. If 
you survive the journey. You don’t 
need to threaten me about telling 
you how this specimen collector 
works. I’ll help anyway.” 

We prepared the specimens I 
sent out to get, then experimented. 

I could not get used to seeing 
each of them inside an expanded 
grain of sand, but the pore structure 
and the crystal lattice itself seemed 
to leave them room to breathe. 
They could even move about, with- 
in small limits. 

The crystal had to be expanded 
up to a reasonable size before it was 
safe to be transmitted into it, for 
an unexpanded quartz crystal 
would be immediate suffocation. 
The force vortices of the quartz 
nuclei, even when expanded, 
seemed to have no effect on a liv- 
ing body. It was a solid solution, 
as John said. 

“The ideal,” he added, “would 
be for us to coach Morry up to 
the stellar-reporter class levels. But 
I think we had better start mean- 



while. No sense wasting time.” 

“I think so, too,” I said. 

EFORE we left the open 
desert, I unpacked the appara- 
tus so they could examine it. They 
thought they could make sets with- 
out much difficulty. The apparatus 
was largely an electrically inhibited 
accelerator, they said. 

I knew the desert quite well, in- 
cluding the areas where the Insti- 
tute radar bovmdary fogged out and 
where people could crawl in a few 
hundred yards without being de- 
tected. 

“That’s all we need,” Bums said. 
“If we plant another set of plates 
and power controls out there, and 
Morry keeps burying prepared 
crystals in advance, he can meet 
us there, do the conversion and 
bring each of us in in a half-inch 
crystal in his pocket.” 

“Then what?” I asked. 

‘Then you hand us over to little 
Dimples. She’ll get us into the right 
stellar-reporters together with a re- 
duced set of plates and controls so 
that we can reconvert on the 
planet. We can travel in the speci- 
men grabber. That will dump us 
out immediately the stellar-re- 
porter lands.” 

I knew little Dimples by sight. 
She was a plump redheaded stu- 
dent in their class. 

“You can’t all go,” I said. 

“Why not?” 

“Because I can’t leave the Insti-

tute grounds. Anyway, where are 
you going to collect the other emi- 
grants from, once you’re out on a 
habitable planet at the back end 
of the Galaxy?” 

“He’s right.” 

We talked it out as I drove the 
trailer back to the Institute. Two 
of them would go immediately, 
each to a different planet on the 
list. They would return to report 
and be sent out again on the next 
stellar-reporter collecting data 
from that planet. Meanwhile, tiie 
thir d would be expelled. He would 
spend his compulsory Holiday se- 
lecting people for despatch. I would 
meet them at the boundary, con- 
vert them and carry the crystals 
in, for Dimples to insert into the 
stellar-reporters. 

They disappeared into the 
metallurgical labs as soon as I 
pulled up in the main courtyard. 
The Director missed them by 
micromillimeters. 

David Adam Smith was a small 
man. With his cloak and large 
hearing aid and long thin face, he 
always made me think of a 
grounded bird. He came hopping 
over the tiles with short quick 
steps, peering at the specimens and 
at me. 

“Go out again tomorrow,” he 
snapped. “I want some copper 
chloride specimens.” 

“Would you like me to drive the 
bubble-dancer to transportation?” 
I asked.

“Who? Oh, that girl. No, Mot' 
ris, I sent her away. You’ll have to 
confine yourself to the curricul

That was odd because I thou^ 

I was about the only person in the 
Institute who could drive a land, 
vehicle. The roads outside were 
built over and everyone used jets. 
But I wouldn’t have put it past him 
to have made the girl walk out o| 
the desert, or to have sent her ij 
his own space-glass jet, dependij)| 
on how he assessed her publicity l 
value. i 

I forgot about it while carting 
off the specimens. 



D imples was pretty, a trifle 
Venusian in her plumpnes^ 
but very intelligent. We met by 
the fountain in one of the smaller 
courtyards. John Thay, she told 
me, had volunteered to remain but 
I was to collect the other two from 
the boundary. 

‘They won’t be too heavy win 
they. Morry?” 

“Three or four pounds. Living 
substance modifies in some way, or 
it may be the effect of being in 
solid solution in an expanded lat- 
tice.” 

“But you can take them down 
to half an inch?” 

“I hope so.” 

We arranged to meet just be- 
fore the afternoon session the next 
day, so that Lee and Burns would 
be sent off in the afternoon stel- 
GALAXt 



lar-reporters wiffi as little delay as 
possible. 

They were there at the boun- 
dary when I drove up the next day. 
Their converter worked. They 
were embedded neatly in the 
quartz crystals. I took them in, 
handed them to Dimples and that 
was that 

Neither Bums nor his stellar-re- 
porter returned. 

We never knew what happened. 
Some of the little rockets did fail. 
Not many. But it was his misfor- 
tune to be in one that did not come 
back. 

Lee White did return safely, and 
was sent out again to his chosen 
planet 

We began to handle crystals 
regularly. John sent each emigrant 
with a miniature converter and 
controls, which I reduced on the 
edge of the desert and handed to 
Dimples, who inserted the crystal 
and the miniature converter into 
the next stellar-reporter due for 
Lee’s planet. He was accumulating 
heaps of converters on his planet, 
but we could not risk leaving an 
emigrant helpless in his crystal 
when the stellar-reporter dumped 
it on the far planet. This way they 
rolled out together on arrival. 

We must have sent out two him- 
dred emigrants of all kinds, for John 
was sending in a mixed selection to 
give the far planet every chance of 
a successful settlement, when Dim- 
ples met me at the foimtain and

cried — moistly — all over my arm. 

“Oh, Morry,” she wept “He’s 
found out.” 

“He,” obviously, was David 
Adam Smith. 

“How do you know? What did 
he say?” 

“He hasn’t said anything. But I 
saw one of the emigrants in his pri- 
vate lab! I shouldn’t have been 
there, and he didn’t know I was. 
But I saw him with one on his 
desk.” 

“Sure about it?” 

“Absolutely certain. It looked 
like one of the men widi a beard we 
sent through about a month ago. 
Do you remember?” 

“But how did he get hold of 
him?” 

“I can’t think. The stellar-re- 
porters are going off all right. I 
thought they were coming back 
empty. I’ve had to let the rest of 
my class know, so that we could 
keep the records faked. We can’t 
accoimt for two hundred stellar- • 
reporters all to the same planet, 
Morry, so I had to.” 

I sent the next bunch of emi- 
grants back with a mesesage to 
John Thay. He came the next after- 
noon and we met on the edge of 
the desert. I explained what had 
happened. 

Ts Dimples certain?” he asked. 

‘The man had a beard and was 
still in his crystal, the way we sent 
him off.” 

John shrugged his shoulders. 



91 



“Well, Morry, it can’t be helped. 
There’s only one course now. We 
must get hold of any crystals in the 
hands of David Adam Smith and 
send them off again — unless you 
and Dimples and all of us want to 
end up in a satellite penitentiary. I 
expect he’s preparing a case against 
us now. With his influence he can 
make it stick. No doubt about that.” 
Illegal emigration, criminal use 
of the Institute property — oh, from 
that angle there was enough to have 
us all put away in space all right. I 
had no doubt that David Adam 
Smith would do it, too. 

6 6 TV OW, his weakest point,” John 
’ said, “is his vanity. That, as 
we know, is immense. Who else 
would run an Institute for three 
hundred students with himself as 
the sole Director? So, if we can ar- 
range something to keep him occu- 
pied for a day or two, we may be 
able to break up into his private 
labs through the floor. I know for a 
fact the walls and ceilings M-e 
studded with alarms. But we 
thought of booby-trapping him 
when we were expelled, and the 
floor seemed the best way in.” 

“And the diversion?” 

“You’d better take me in now in 
your pocket. I want to have a word 
with Dimples’ class.” 

He stepped on the maxima plate. 
I converted him down, buried the 
plates as usual and went back to the 
Institute. 



I gave the crystal to Dimples. 

“Meet me here in an hour,” she 
said. 

An hour later, she was back. 

“Here, Morry. This is the power 
sheer from a shovel. There’s one in 
every stellar-reporter for cutting 
rock specimens. John says you can 
come up from the cellar with that 
Do you know what he means?” 

“Yes. What’s he doing with 
you?” 

“You’ll see. Just come to our 
class area tomorrow as if you’re 
delivering sp>ecimens. Fhit the crys- 
tal with John in it in your pocket 
and go and report to the Director 
exactly what you found in our area 
— apart from the crystal, of course. 
You are to release John from that 
when you get to the cellar, immedi- 
ately after David Adam Smith goes 
hurrying out to see what happened 
to us.” 

She would not tell me any more 
than that. 

So when I found next morning 
that every stellar-reporter in the 
class area was missing and that 
Dimples and her entire class had 
gone with them, I did not have to 
act astonished. About a third of the 
Institute — nearly a hundred stu- 
dents — were in that class, doing 
nothing else but build a complete 
catalogue of the stars and their 
planetary systems by means of the 
stellar-reporters. And the whole lot 
had gone! 

David Adam Smith did not be- 
G AL AX Y 



w 

ijeve me, either, until he saw for 
■ jiimself. Then he sat down to work 
F ^rou^ the firing calibrators to find 
out where the stellar-reporters had 
tjeen sent. He waved me away. 

I went straight to the cellar be- 
neath his private labs and recon- 
verted John. He stepped off the 
maxima plate swiftly before the 
crystal could materialize him. 

“Hey,” I said, “you’ve reversed 
it” 

“Naturally. It’s a minor adjust- 
ment in the time-lag. Otherwise 
there would always have to be a 
second person present before you 
could get out of a crystal. We think 
that’s what went wrong with poor 
Burns Gilbert. But we’ll never 
know, I’m afraid. Let’s get on.” 

We set the power cutter to work 
on the cellar ceiling. 

It was only designed to ctit rock 
specimens small enough to be 
brought back in the stellar-report- 
ers that carried it, but after two 
hours we had a hole right up into 
the private labs. 

I lifted John Thay and followed 
him up. 

IMPLES was right 
There was a long row of crys- 
tals in a nutrient tank against one 
wall, arranged so that it could not 
be seen into from the windows. 
About fifty crystals were racked 
there and each had a six-inch figure 
in it I walked over to look at them 
with John. 



“These aren’t the ones I sent!” 
John said. 

“They’re not?” 

“Not one.” 

We looked at the line in silence. 
I had gotten used to handling filled 
crystals, but the sight of all these 
human beings, miniature and 
watching us, making waving mo- 
tions so far as they could within the 
lattice of their crystals — this was 
unnerving. 

“No,” John Thay repeated. 
“These are not ours. But that one 
there is the bubble dancer we were 
expelled for bringing here!” 

I looked at the little figure, pink 
against the clear quartz. 

“Who are the others?” I asked. 

John Thay walked briskly down 
the line scooping them up. 

“Never mind that for a moment, 
Morry. Just help me collect every 
one of these.” 

I grabbed handfuls of crystals 
from the rack, stuffing them in my 
pockets, imtil between us we had 
every one. 

John took a last look to check. 
Then we dropped through the hole 
in the floor, down into the cellar. 

“I had an elaborate plan in 
mind,” he said to me, as we hurried 
away. “But this changes everything. 
Is the converter in your truck work- 
ing?” We shot out into the court- 
yard. 

“If you’re in a hurry, John, why 
not use the one there in the cellar?” 

“Hell, you’re ri^t This has

shaken me so much I can hardly 
think. Quickly, let’s get these crys- 
tals reconverted.” 

We turned and rushed back to 
the cellar we had just left. 

I grabbed the power controls, 
John fed the crystals onto the min- 
ima plate, I pressed the button and 
fielded the staggering human being 
off the maxima plate before the 
enlarged crystal came following 
through. The crystals I kicked into 
the corner of the cellar. 

We did not talk, but concen- 
trated on this rush conversion. 

When we had released the last 
man, there were fifty-three people 
in the cellar, including John, my- 
self and the bubble dancer, who for 
some reason clung to me and 
kissed me. 

Most of the people were elderly 
men. Their clothes were tattered 
and stained by nutrient solution. 
Some were threadbare. Many had 
been wearing laboratory coats of 
ceramic fabric, which had chipped 
and fallen away in patches. 

They must have been in the 
crystals for a long time. 

I watched John bend anxiously 
over a group of elderly men. 

“Doctor Firnivale. Professor 
Marrpole. Doctor Hutk. And Wil- 
liams.” 

The men we had just released 
nodded in turn. 

“You, Dr. Firinvale,” John said. 
“Did you give the advanced geo- 
physics lectures?” 



“Through that crook’s hearing] 
aid,” said the tattered man on the ] 
cellar floor. “Yes, I did. I could hear 
the questions and I told him the 
answers. So did all these others 
here.” ^ 

“Professor Marrpole, I recog. ■ 
nized you from a stereo-record you 
made on magnetic differentiation 
on small planets. Is that how David 
Adam Smith became the world au- 
thority when you disappeared?” 
“Yes,” the man with the shaggy 
beard confirmed. “He caught me by 
asking me to stand on a plate for a 
live recording.” 

OHN turned to me. 

“We have here, Morry, a careful 
collection of the leading specialists 
in the world. These people are the 
reason for David Adam Smith be- 
ing able to outthink any fifty men. 
These are the fifty men he built his 
reputation with!” 

“I don’t understand why you all 
helped him,” I said. 

“Because he used to oscillate the 
crystals we were in, young man.” 
“But now it’s our turn!” 

“By heaven, wait imtil I meet 
that treacherous snake . .” 

“I’m going to sue him for every 
credit he has!” 

“Who would care to join me in 
pulling him into small pieces sur- 
gically?” 

The babble in the cellar rose in 
volume and intensity. Under it all, 
the bubble-dancer was whispering 



jji my ear how grateful she was to 
great big me, and how that foul old 
goat had kept her for amusement 
just because she walked into his 
office to complain when he fired 
those nice boys . 

“He had to, I suppose,” I said. 
"If you saw all these people in 
crystals.” 

“Gentlemen, gentlemen,” John 
roared. “Please!” 

There was silence. 

“Thank you. Which of you in 
fact thought of the stellar-reporters 
for accumulating data on other 
parts of the Galaxy?” 

“I did,” said a tall thin man by 
the door. “Higgins is my name.” 
Even I had heard of the astro- 
physicist inventor. 

“Had it occurred to you that 
with these crystals and your stellar- 
reporters man could expand through 
the Galaxy?” 

“No. But now that you raise the 
point, of course we could!” 

“My friend, Morris here, and I 
and some colleagues have been do- 
ing so privately for some time . .” 
John waited until the excited 
murmuring died away. 

“We thought David Adam Smith 
had discovered us. And that is really 
why we broke into his office . and 
found you all there. But I now 
think he knows nothing about it. 
Subject to your agreement, I sug- 
gest we should keep him in ignor- 
ance, lock him in a quartz crystal 
here and continue the private mi- 



gration without involving him.” 

“Why not bring him to justice?” 
asked Higgins. 

“Because I doubt if the govern- 
ment would believe their eyes. You 
have built David Adam Smith into 
a legend that w^uld be difficult to 
break. Also because they would 
certainly take the Institute from 
anyone else, hold up the experi- 
ments and delay everything. And I 
have a lot of friends out there in 
space trying to establish a plane- 
tary colony.” 

Marrpole laughed. 

“Really,” he said, “we have been 
providing all the brain power of 
this Institute for so long, we may 
as well continue. Speaking for my- 
self, gentlemen, a few years free 
from any restraint whatever are ex- 
actly what I now need. I am in 
favor.” 

There was a general mutter of 
agreement. 

“Thank you,” John said. “And 
now, if you will follow me, there 
are excellent showers and a whole 
class of spare rooms.” 

“You stay with me,” I said to the 
bubble-dancer. 

I led her through the Institute to 
the classrooms where Director 
David Adam Smith was still plot- 
ting the courses of the missing stel- 
lar-reporters. They would be back 
soon, but he was never to know 
that. 

I took him from behind and held 
him off the floor by his elbows, then

twisted him round in the air so 
that he could see us both. 

“Yes,” I said. “She’s out And 
you’re going in.” 

He started to scream so I clipped 
him. 

Then I carried him out to his 
private labs. I made him imlock the 
door and unset the alarms, dumped 
him on the maxima plate of his own 
converter and shot him into a spare 
enlarged crystal he had on his desk, 
after taking off his hearing aid. He 
didn’t need it. It was only an am- 
plifier so that he could hear the 
advice of whoever was in there at 
the time. I put him in and clipped 
the mike onto my shirt. 



“What are you doing?” asked* 
the bubble-dancer. * 

“Look,” I said. “This fella could* 
do it. And someone’s got to take j 
the other lectures. And I’m never ■ 
going to get to be a qualified pro- B 
fessor any other way.” B 

“But I thought they said he^ 
didn’t know an}rthing?” the bubble- 
dancer asked. 

“He must remember some of it, 
or I’ll oscillate him at a high fre- 
quency.” 

Meanwhile, I thought I’d prac-

the former Director did not seem to 
find it fimny.

What’s Only Money? 

T he opinion of a person on 
the value of money de- 
pends, as a rule, on how 
much of it he owns at the moment 
So let’s not waste time with ethics, 
morality or financial philosophy. If 
I had not just sworn off philosophy, 
I would now say that I mean the 
actual money which has been with 
us for as long as people could 
count, and is apparently going to 
stay with us for as long as they can 
still count. 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



97 



Although in science fiction 
money is mentioned quite often — 
some writers are realists and as- 
sume that budget fights will also be 
with us for as long as there are 
budgets, which is perhaps forever 
—you rarely hear anjdhing of what 
kind of money it is. The hero often 
pays “three credits” or “two stel- 
lors” for a meal or something, but 
just what does he pay? Does he 
hand over paper bills or does he 
drop coins on the coimter? 

I can think of only a few in- 
stances where science fiction writ- 
ers were more specific. When Kim- 
ball Kinnison loses a “one millo 
bet,” he sends a coin halfway 
across the Galaxy, being a Lens- 
man and, as Galactic Coordinator, 
presumably entitled to free mail- 
ing privileges. When the hero in 
Gravy Planet is lost in South 
America, he feeds plastic coins 
into a pay telephone — without 
getting his coimection. George O. 
Smith, having invented a duplica- 
tor which can duplicate anything, 
then had to invent something (an 
alloy, I think) which could not 
be duplicated because it would 
blow up if anybody tried to. 

I can think of another example, 
this one from foreign science fic- 
tion. Kurd Lasswitz, in his On 
Two Planets (way back in the 
final decade of the last century), 
described how his hero had to pay 
for a trip on Mars. The Martians 
expressed values in terms of elec- 
98 



trie current; the trip cost an un- 
specified number of kilowatts and 
the payment is made in the shape 
of a coin which is a storage bat- 
tery actually holding that number 
of kilowatts. 

Since the future of coinage is so 
disputable, let us look at the past 
and see what has gone before. 
I’ll not dwell on weirdies like pay- 
ments in strings of cowrie shells or 
the big stone money of the island 
of Yap but stick to normal coins. 

¥F you ask anybody which 
metals are used for coinage, 
you receive the more or less auto- 
matic reply “silver and nickel.” If 
you keep quiet, the man will 
somewhat shamefacedly remem- 
ber that there are copper coins, 
and everybody knows, naturally, 
that Dad still handled gold coins. 
Actually nickel is a late-comer to 
the coinage picture; it is just about 
a century old. Before that, the 
coinage metals were gold, silver 
and copper. 

The most valuable of them, the 
gold coins, seem to have started 
out as electrum coins. Electrum is 
a naturally occurring alloy of gold 
and silver, and one might say, as 
a rule of thumb, that gold con- 
taining more than 20 per cent sil- 
ver was electrum. The trouble was, 
of course, just how much silver a 
given lump of metal contained. 
Was it 20 per cent or 30 per cent 
or still more? 

GALAXY 



I By about 700 B.C., gold could be 
jeparated from silver and the first 
gold coins came into existence. 
Since nobody ever threw a gold 
piece away, die number of coins 
from the past that are still aroimd 
is simply fantastic (everything the 
gold would buy has been used up, 
worn away, decayed or eroded, 
but the coins remain) and it was 
no great loss to history to analyze 
a few of them. They turned out to 
be 997 and 998 fine, actually too 
high a purity to be practical, for 
pure gold is a rather soft metal. 

When it comes to purity, the 
layman generally flounders a lit- 
tle. He knows that 14-carat gold 
is good gold, and when he looks 
for a stan^, it probably says 14K. 
But if he should buy a wedding 
ring in England, the salesman will 
say “22 carat, of course,” but the 
stamp inside is likely to read 917. 
The system here is that pure gold 
is 24 carat or 1000. Consequent- 
ly, then, gold of 12 carat would be 
500, the other 500-1000th being 
usually silver; normally the best 
gold used for jewelry is 18 carat 
or 750. But coins nm from 917 
(British) to 980. 

“Pure” coins continued to be 
made though, long after it was 
realized that pure gold was too 
soft. The Palatinate (in West 
Germany) struck coins from gold 
washed from the Rhine river; they 
felt that Rheingold must not be 
alloyed. The city of Hamburg 

for your information 



could not do less, so there are 
Hamburg coins (say of about 
1750) of more than 990 purity. 

Aside from these facts, only a 
few oddities can be told. The big- 
gest gold “coin” ever to exist is 
one mentioned in the Bible; it is 
the gold “wedge” or “tongue” of 
50 shekels’ worth. But we don’t 
know how it looked. The largest 
known coin was struck in 1654 by 
order of Shah-Jahan, Mogul Em- 
peror of Hindustan. It was a 200- 
mohur piece with a diameter of 
5% inches. Eoiowing what a mo- 
hur piece is supposed to weigh, its 
weight figures to more than 70 
oimces. We can’t weigh it any 
more because it is lost, but it was 
last seen in Patna in 1820 and 
about that time somebody made a 
plaster cast which is now in the 
British Museum. The second larg- 
est (not lost) is a Venetian 100- 
zecchini piece (undated) with a 
diameter of 3Va inches, while the 
third largest (you can buy one 
for about $6000) is a Bohemian 
100-ducat piece of 1629 with a 
diameter of 3 inches. 

give you a more tangible 
comparison: the “cartwheel,” 
the U. S. silver dollar, has a diam- 
eter of IV 2 inches and an official 
weight of 412.5 grains. Its true 
weight may be 6 grains more or 
less. The double eagle, the U. S. 
$20 piece, has a diameter of slight- 
ly over 1 Vi inch, and the diameter 

99 



of the British 5-pound piece is 
lYs inch. 

As for silver, it is the coinage 
metal. Coin catalogues usually 
state what metal a coin is: G for 
gold and C for copper, but if the 
coin is silver, nothing is said. 
Silver coins, if U. S., also have a 
fineness of 900, but this time the 
900 means the silver content; the 
remainder is mainly copper. The 
largest silver coin is almost the 
same size as the largest gold coins 
— it is a 4-thaler piece of Bruns- 
wick (1685) with a diameter of 
3 Vi inches, more than double the 
diameter of a dollar piece. 

Before we proceed to nickel 
and copper, it must be mentioned 
that one country once had plati- 
num money. In Russia, three plati- 
num coins of 3, 6 and 12 ruble 
denomination were minted be- 
tween 1828 and 1845. Just in 
case somebody is curious: they are 
not rare, merely expensive; a fine 
specimen of the 3-ruble piece will 
cost aroimd $250. 

Nickel, as I mentioned, is com- 
paratively new on the metallurgi- 
cal scene. Before it became avail- 
able, money smaller in value than 
silver would conveniently be pro- 
vided by copper. Well, it was cop- 
per with other things in it and that 
has produced a few mysteries. Let 
us first get the terminology 
straight. 

Copper, when pure, is very soft 
too. The trick of adding tin to 



make it hard was discovered early. 
Copper with 10 to 15 per cent tin 
in it is called bronze; if it has 
15 to 25 per cent tin in it, it is 
called bell metal because it was 
used for church bells. Brass, how- 
ever, is copper with an admixture 
of zinc, and zinc did not become 
known until aroimd 1500 A.D., and 
even then it was often confused 
with bismuth. 

Many copper coins through the 
ages contain such comparatively 
small admixtures of other metals 
that calling- them copper coins is 
fully justified. (The U. S. Ic piece, 
for example, is 95 per cent copper 
with 5 per cent tin and zinc.) But 
bronze coins with 10 to 15 per 
cent tin were also common since 
ancient times. For example, Celtic 
coins found in 1948 in England 
and dating back to 80 B.C. are 
bronze with 10 per cent tin. 

Brass coins came much later, 
but they have a forerunner. One 
Roman coin, struck under the 
reign of Augustus, was found to 
contain 17.3 per cent zinc - 
straight “brass” of our terminology. 
But real brass was not developed 
imtil nearly 1700 years later. Cor- 
rect— the brass of the Roman coin 
must be an accident, made from 
copper and zinc ores that occurred 
in conjunction. 

Coins which were brass on pur- 
pose, so to speak, are rather un- 
usual; most of them were due to 
an emergency of some kind. The 
GALAXY 



most famous is the one which pro- 
duced what is called “Irish gun 
money.” When James II of Eng- 
land fled to Ireland, he gathered 
an army to force his return. The 
army wished to be paid. James 
took what he could get: bronze 
cannon and brass cannon, bell- 
metal bells, and bells of whatever 
alloy they happened to be. The 
guns and the bells were made into 
money, the so-called “brass shil- 
ling” being one of them. The 
workmanship of this “gun money” 
happens to be excellent, but the 
composition of any specific coin 
couldn’t be more indiscriminate. 

TT may be mentioned in passing 
at this point that British law 
was peculiar for several centuries. 
To forge gold or silver coins was 
punishable by death or deporta- 
tion to an outlying colony. Forg- 
ing copper coins, however, was 
just a misdemeanor. 

Also in passing, the term cart- 
wheel, so common for our silver 
dollar, was originally applied to 
a copper coin, the tuppence of 
George III of England which meas- 
ured 1 % inch in diameter and was 
also very thick. (The Czars of all 
the Russias beat this later with a 
copper coin two inches in diam- ' 
eter, but you had to travel to Rus- 
sia to see it, for Russians who 
could travel abroad would not de- 
class themselves by having copper 
coins in their purses.)

Though bronze has been in use 
for a long time on and off, it did 
not find much favor in the Wes- 
tern Hemisphere. The Confedera- 
cy struck a Ic bronze coin, but 
it was not placed into circulation. 
The Union struck a 2 c bronze 
piece in 1864; it did not live long. 
However, Americans can now 
handle bronze coins without cross- 
ing the ocean: the Canadian Ic 
of 1937 and the Mexican 20 cen- 
tavos of 1943 are both bronze. 

In trying to get back to nickel, 
I first have to say that there was 
a wooden nickel, or rather a 
wooden 5c piece, but it -was local. 
And this side issue — nickel still 
has to wait — brings up the larger 
side issue of which other metals 
were used for coinage. 

Well, a section of ancient India 
and more recently the Malay 
states had lead coins. More recent- 
ly, on the Malay peninsula, you 
had “money trees” (Fig. 1.) from 




Fig. 1: Malaccan ''Money Tree" when new. 
Brokea-ofiF "change" had center holes for 
stringing. The metal was pure tin. 



100 



101 



which you broke off what you 
needed. They were usually tin, 
sometimes lead. 

The ones who went in for new 
metals for coins were the Ger- 
mans during the first World War. 
The Imperial coinage prior to 
1914 consisted of the following: 

1- and 2-pfennig pieces (copper), 
5-, 10- and 25-pfennig pieces 

(nickel), V 2 mark, 1-, 3- and 
5-mark coins (silver) plus 10- and 
20-mark coins (gold). 

About three months after the 
war started a few changes became 
necessary. The gold and silver 
were needed for foreign exchange, 
so everything from one mark up 
became paper. The nickel was 
needed for steel and the copper 
was needed for driving bands for 
artillery shells. Still, the people 
needed small change, or else the 
very lack of small change would 
help inflation along. So the 1- 
pfennig piece reappeared in shiny 
aluminum and the 10-pfennig 
piece in dull zinc. A year or so 
later, the 1-pfennig was no longer 
needed and the 10-pfennig became 
iron. 

It was the first zinc and the 
first iron coinage. As for zinc coins, 
Belgium adopted this metal in 
1920 for small coins. And the Ger- 
mans repeated during the second 
World War as occupation money 
for The Netherlands. Iron was 
used for Ic pieces in the United 
States in World War II. 



B ut the 1-pfennig piece was 
not the first aluminum coin- 
age. The French had announced a 
whole set of aluminum coins in 
1906, but then did not issue them. 
(They have aluminum coins 
now.) The British did make alu- 
minum coins in 1908 for British 
East Africa, but they were univer- 
sally distrusted. However, the first 
aluminum coin was a Texas local 
token. It was about the size of a 
silver quarter — unfortunately I 
only have a photograph which 
does not show the denomination 
The year is clear, though — it was 
1890. 

Aluminum and especially alumi- 
num bronze coins are now in use 
in many countries, and after men- 
tioning that the state of Saxony 
issued piorcelain coins in about 
1921 (they did not last long, but 
not because they broke easily; 
they didn’t — inflation soon made 
their denominations ridiculous), I 
can go on to nickel as the con- 
cluding item. Actually the U. S. 
“nickel” has that name mostly by 
courtesy, for its official composi- 
tion is 25 per cent nickel and 75 
per cent copper. It is what might 
be called nickel bronze. 

There is a reason for that which 
was first established — rather pain-, 
fully — by the Swiss government 
During the early part of the nine-i 
teenth century, when nickel be- 
came available in reasonable 
quantities, several manufacturers 
GALAXY 



started compounding nickel alloys 
for cheap jewelry and ornamenta- 
tion. A German firm was especial- 
ly successful with an alloy which 
Ihey named Argentan — Latin ar- 
fjsntum is silver; the trade name 
was meant to indicate that it 
looked like silver but wasn’t — 
but in other coimtries it was 
quickly dubbed “German silver.” 
Its composition was, and is, 55 per 
cent copper, 25 per cent zinc and 
20 per cent nickel. 

In 1850 the Swiss government 
thought that Argentan would be a 
nice metal for small coins since it 
was so hard and durable. But the 
Swiss also wanted to make then- 
coins more valuable, so they added 
between 5 and 15 per cent of sil- 
ver, the percentage depending on 
the face value of the coin. This 
happened to produce an alloy that 
they just could not handle, it was 
so hard. The coinage die made 
such a shallow impression that the 
coin looked as if it had been in 
circulation for at least thirty years. 
Increasing the pressure broke the 
die. 

After experimenting for several 
decades, the Swiss decided to use 
pure nickel, or almost pure, be- 
cause somebody named Fleitman 
found that nickel became tract- 
able with one or two per cent of 
magnesium added to it. Thus the 
Swiss in 1881 made genuine nickel 
coins. Nobody else ever did. The 
Belgians started the 75 per cent 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



copper and 25 per cent nickel al- 
loy in 1855. The United States 
struck their first nickel pieces in 
1865. They were 3 c pieces. The 
5c nickels followed in 1866, slow- 
ly replacing the silver half-dimes. 

These 3c and 5c pieces had the 
current composition, first used by 
the Belgians, but from 1856 to 
1863 we had what was called 
“white cents,” containing 22 per 
cent nickel, otherwise copper. 

T IKE the first brass coin, the 
^ first “nickel” was also acci- 
dental. Numismatists, well ac- 
quainted with a coin struck under 
the reign of the Bactrian king 
Euthydemus II in 235 B.C., no- 
ticed that it looked different from 
all other ancient coins, and final- 
ly a much damaged piece was sac- 
rificed for chemical analysis. To 
the chemist who performed it, the 
result might not have looked too 
strange, but the coin experts whis- 
tled in surprise. The result: 77.6 
copper; 20.0 nickel; 1.0 iron; 0.54 
cobalt; 0.86 residue. 

No, the mintmaster of king 
Euthydemus II was not 2090 years 
ahead of his time; the mystery 
can be explained if we assume that 
the ingots came from China. Mines 
in the provinces of Yunan and 
Szechuan did produce something 
called pei-tung or ‘Svhite copper,” 
an accidental mixture of nickel 
and copper ores. 

Well, now for the future.

What should a one-credit coin 
be like? To begin with, it should 
not be too large, but neither 
should it be too light, for there is 
some reassurance in the heft of 
your change. Of course it must 
look attractive and not tarnish. 
Naturally it must not show wear. 
Since it will be much used in 
vending machines, it must have 
some characteristic by which the 
machine can test it. Let us say it 
must give off a sound of a specific 
note if dropped one centimeter 
onto a stainless steel bar. It might 
fluoresce imder ultra-violet light 
with a sharply defined specific 
wave length. 

It must be such, in short, that 
laws against counterfeiting are un- 
necessary because nobody could 
do it anyhow. And its value must 
be definite and stable.

more of them than their helicop- 
ters can carry! 

ANY QUESTIONS? 

Chaw Call 

TVr Y first letter is from some- 
body I know personally, a 
fellow writer and good personal 
friend: syndicated TV columnist 
Eve Starr out in Hollywood. 

She asks two feminine ques- 
tions. One is easy to deal with, for 
it concerns the clothing that will 
be worn in a spaceship. The an- 



swer is: “Not very much, but what 
there is will be comfortable 
though not loose. A loose garment 
mi^t catch on a switch or some- 
thing similar.” 

The second question is one I 
can answer only by great good 
luck (other people have done a 
lot of research on it and have just 
published some of their findings). 
That part of the letter reads: 
“Just what are our astronauts go- 
ing to eat in space? I know, 
mainly from your book, that the 
idea of ultra-concentrated food 
pills is an impossibility. But no- 
where, not even in your book, have 
I found any specific information of 
just what they will eat.” 

Yes, Eve, that is not in my book 
— at least not yet — and you are 
very much yourself in asking that 
question. For those who live in 
cities where Eve Starr’s column 
does not appear, I have to explain 
that it deals with television and 
that she is in the habit of poking 
a well-manicured finger at pre- 
cisely the point which the pro- 
ducer, director, actor or script 
writer had hoped would not be 
noticed by anybody. 

Now, as for the food which will 
be eaten by a space crew, it clear- 
ly falls into two categories: the 
food which is taken along as food, 
and the food which is produced 
while under way. 

The ratio between the food that 
is carried and the food that is 
GALAXY 



104 



manufactured will depend mostly 
on the duration of the trip. For or- 
biting Earth for a day or several, 
and even for the ten-day flight 
around the Moon without landing, 
all the food will be carried along. 
Only when a space mission takes 
at least a month will manufac- 
tured food be considered at all, 
and when the duration approaches 
a full year, the manufactured food 
will outweigh (in the literal sense) 
the food that has been taken along. 

A S regards the food which is to 
be taken along, there are sev- 
eral requirements. Of course there 
must be no dead weight, or as lit- 
tle as possible (things must be 
wrapped, after all). Moreover, the 
food must resist spoilage, remain 
appetizing, be not monotonous 
and, most important, it must be 
something that can be eaten under 
weightless conditions. The latter 
mainly means that it must not be 
dry and crunchy, for dry food is 
almost impossible to eat when 
weightless, as I explained in an 
earlier column. 

Food manufacturers have started 
research in two directions, the 
“toothpaste” foods and the “lip- 
stick” foods. The former can be 
squeezed into the mouth from a 
tube. The ideal is that the tube 
itself is edible too. If that cannot 
be accomplished, it should have 
as little mass as possible (thin 
plastic tubes would do that). The 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



lipstick foods also live up to their 
name — there are foods of a cer- 
tain consistency which can be 
shaped into sticks from which one 
can bite off a piece. If you imagine 
a stick of fairly soft cheese, you 
have a rather good idea of one 
type of such lipstick foods. 

As regards the foods manufac- 
tured en route, all I could have 
said only three years ago was that 
the space engineers had certain 
ideas. But now we can be much 
more specific — let’s admit it — 
partly due to research work which 
did not have space travel in mind 
at all. 

For the last eight years or so, I 
have been pointing out that oxy- 
gen for breathing does not need 
to be taken along on long trips, 
because it can be manufactured by 
growing plants. For several rea- 
sons, it was known that the single- 
celled alga known as CMorella was 
especially good as an oxygen man- 
ufacturer. All it needed was water 
(in which it lives), carbon dioxide 
(produced by the crew members) 
and sunlight (available in space 
at any time). Now these Chlorel- 
la algae, in producing oxygen, also 
reproduce themselves. Which 
means that after a week you have 
a much larger supply of Chlorella 
than you had at the outset. 

Once this was realized, the 
question came up: ‘What do we 
do with the surplus chlorella?” 
The answer was: “Eat them, if 

105 



they are edible.” But as far as 
space research was concerned, no 
additional work was done for a 
while. Now it happens that Jap- 
anese researchers have investi- 
gated the edibility and food value 
of CMorella — but they did not 
have spaceships in mind; they 
were just interested in additional 
food supplies. 

Chlorella, it turned out, was 
simply excellent. To begin with, 
it was edible; the Japanese made 
a Chlorella soup which looks green 
and pleased their taste. European 
and American researchers ad- 
mitted that it might be nourishing, 
but said nasty things about the 
“cod liver oil taste.” As a personal 
aside, I might mention that I hap- 
pen not to share the wide dislike 
for that taste. I don’t adore it, but 
it doesn’t disturb me. 

Leaving the question of taste 
aside for the moment, the nutri- 
tional value of Chlorella is most 
unusual. One kilogram of dried 
algae contains 5300 calories — or 
one poimd contains 2410 calories, 
if you prefer the unscientific 
measurements. 

Not only is the caloric value 
large, dried algae also contain a 
nice proprartion of the items that 
make a balanced diet; 40 per cent 
albumin, 20 per cent fat, 30 per 
cent carbohydrates and 10 per 
cent mineral salts. As for vitamins, 
dried algae come through beauti- 
fully: a mere 100 grams (about 
106 



3 Vi oimces) contain more than 
the vitamin requirements of an 
adult per day, except for vitamin 
C, which is plentiful in fresh living 
algae but destroyed in drying. 

T IKEWISE, the so-called “es- 
sential amino acids” are pres- 
ent in fully sufficient quantities, 
and there is also enough fat. In 
fact, it is quite easy to make 
Chlorella produce more fat than 
it usually does. The trick is so 
simple as to be nearly ridiculous: 
just prevent the algae from get- 
ting nitrogen. If they can’t get 
nitrogen, they cannot produce al- 
bumin, and after some time they 
cannot reproduce any more be- 
cause there is just that much albu- 
min available to them. However, 
while they can no longer split, 
they still go on living and produc- 
ing food, but because nitrogen is 
lacking, the only food they can 
make is fat. 

As I mentioned, the taste is too 
much like cod liver oil to please 
Europeans and Americans. For 
this reason Madame N. Tamiya 
concocted a few recipes for non- 
Japanese, like white bread with 
Chlorella and green noodles with 
Chlorella. But the addition of the 
algae is only about six per cent, 
of the total weight, not enough 
for space voyages. 

Knowing that the taste is sup- 
pressed by the addition of sugar, 
Mme. Tamiya produced her mas- 
GALAXY 



terpiece: Chlorella ice cream. The 
ice cream is very nourishing, has 
a pretty li^t-green color (which, 
to our mind, is all right for ice 
cream but somewhat disturbing in 
bread) and is vanilla flavored. 

While Japanese scientists were 
going after Chlorella for direct con- 
sumption by humans, scientists of 
the Boeing Aircraft Company fol- 
lowed a different idea. Is there 
something that lives on Chlorella 
— or any kind of algae, in case 
somebody comes up with another 
alga which is a still better oxygen 
producer — and which people 
would eat? 



The answer is Tilapia (Fig. 2). 




Fig. 2: Tilapia, of the family Cich/idae, 
the fish that will go to Mars. 



Tilapia is a fish, of a size that a 
man can comfortably hold in his 
hand, with the tail hanging out. 
It is a fresh-water fish perfectly 
adapted to scum-covered tropical 
ponds, peaceful, content if it is 
provided with the two necessities 
for its life: warm water and plen- 
ty of little algae to eat. In nature 
(the fish is spreading fast through 
the tropics, naturally), it will 
probably snap up insects which 
have fallen into the water and eat 
a worm if it can get one. But it 
will thrive and grow and make 

for your information 



nice white fish flesh on a diet of 
algae alone. 

One of the answers to the ques- 
tion of what to do with surplus 
Chlorella is Tilapia, so the astro- 
nauts will probably add fresh fish 
to their “toothpaste” and “lip- 
stick” foods. T ilapia, in addition 
to being tasty, has another ad- 
mirable characteristic for space 
travel purposes: about eight weeks 
after it has been hatched, it is 
ready to produce offspring. 

I can add one more specific 
item, also based on research going 
on at Boeing: mushrooms. They 
are a fast-growing kind which can 
be raised on waste matter. Since 
mushrooms are mostly water, they 
do not contribute many calories to 
the diet. But they do provide 
flavor and a change in the menu. 

Well, here is the space dinner: 
Chlorella soup, boiled fresh Tila- 
pia with mushrooms, bread (taken 
along) with fatty Chlorella spread, 
Chlorella ice creani dessert. 

Jobs lor Space Psychiatrists? 

^HE next letter is also from a 

lady, Mrs. Toni Pedigo (no 
address given), who writes that 
her husband “is going into psy- 
chiatry and would like to com- 
bine it with space research. In 
what way could a psychiatrist 
work in the field of space research 
without getting involved, with mili- 
tary service?” 



107 



The joker is in the last six 
words of that second sentence. 
Otherwise I am quite sure that a 
good psychiatrist would be wel- 
comed with open arms (and a 
steady pay check). 

The whole field of space re- 
search falls into three categories. 

First, the machinery, rocket 
motors, fuels, fuel pumps, control 
systems and so on. A fantastic 
amount of work is being done, and 
has been done in this field — after 
all, what have I been writing about 
and revising for the last dozen 
years? 

The second item is the physical 
well-being of the pilot, bearable 
accelerations, comfortable cabin 
temperatures, something to eat. 
Here, too, a great deal of work 
has already been accomplished, 
mostly by the Department of 
Space Medicine of the U. S. Air 
Force. And, as my reply to Eve 
Starr shows, the food problem is 
under concentrated and apparent- 
ly successful attack right now. 

As for the third item, the men- 
tal well-being of the space pilot, 
I find myself somewhat at a loss 
for words. Indubitably work is go- 
ing on, but I haven’t read much 
about the psychological end, ex- 
cept occasional papers by Dr. Sieg- 
fried Gerathewohl in the Jorurnal 
of Aviation Medicine and similar 
places. 

I may be completely off-track 
— tomorrow’s mail may bring a 



nice fat volume on psychological 
research — but I have the feeling 
that this field has not been pur- 
sued as assiduously as the mechan- 
ical and physiological aspects. 
Maybe this is given by the nature 
of the case: first we had to find 
out what could be done, and then 
what the man (or men) will have 
to endure physically before psy- 
chology could be tackled. 

But to do any work here with- 
out being involved with the mili- 
tary services sounds like an im- 
possible order. It is true that the 
Space Agency NASA is a civilian 
agency, but NASA does not main- 
tain factories where big rockets 
can be built. NASA goes to Red- 
stone Arsenal, or to the Air Force, 
and then to Convair and Martin 
and other companies, and tells 
them what they want next. Since 
NASA also does not maintain a 
big proving groimd (their own is 
the comparatively small one on 
Wallop’s Island), the firings have 
to be done from the Atlantic Mis- 
sile Range at Cape Canaveral 
(run by the Air Force) or from 
Vandenberg in California. 

My opinion, therefore, is this: a ' 
good psychiatrist will certainly be 
welcomed and there will be work 
for him. Said psychiatrist can con- 
tinue to wear a business suit in- 
stead of a uniform. But he will be 
involved with the armed services 
consciously, subconsciously and in 
any other way there is.

There Was Darkness aver 
the Whole Land 

IJEADER P. Christopher Os- 
born in Nashville, Tennessee 

— as a result of a private argument 

— wrote to ask whether scientists 
or historians, or both, are in agree- 
ment on the natural cause of the 
darkness at the death of Christ, 
which, as the Bible says, lasted 
“from the sixth to the ninth hour.” 
Either Mr. Osborn or the man 
with whom he argued (the letter 
is by no means specific on that 
point, possibly by design) “al- 
ways” thought that the darkness 
was an eclipse of the Sun, while 
the other said it must have been a 
sandstorm because eclipses of the 
Sun do not last three hours. 

Half of the argument can be 
settled in one paragraph: it could 
not possibly have been an eclipse 
of the Sun. The Crucifixion took 
place on the last day preceding the 
Passover week, and it is clearly 
stated that the first day of that 
week was a Saturday. Since Jew- 
ish holidays begin at sundown, 
Passover began Friday night at 
sundown, so the Crucifixion took 
place in the afternoon of that Fri- 
day. Now at Passover the Moon 
must be full, hence it is at the 
opposite end of its orbit. 

However, there is one more 
possibility. 

Fridays with Passover begin^ 
ning in the evening hours are com- 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



paratively rare. During the latter 
part of the lifetime of Christ, there 
were just two. One was April sev- 
enth, 30 A. D.; the other April 
third, 33 A. D. (Julian calendar). 
Historians are generally in favor 
of the later date because an early 
Christian writer stated that the 
event took place “during the 
eighteenthyear and seventh month 
of the reign of Imperator Tiberi- 
us.” That is, from March 17 to 
April 16 of the year 33 A.D. 

Astrondimically speaking, noth- 
ing out of the ordinary happened 
on April seventh, 30 A. D. But on 
April third, 33 a. d., there was a 
partial eclipse of the Moon, visible 
from Palestine. As seen from Jeru- 
salem, the Moon rose while in 
partial eclipse a few minutes after 
six P.M. From moonrise to the end 
of the eclipse took half an hour. 

It could not have been an 
eclipse of the Sun. 

For the hours given in the 
Bible, it must have been meteor- 
ological, most likely a sandstorm. 
But on the historically most likely 
date, there was an eclipse of the 
Moon in the evening — that is, 
during the first hour of the holiday 
week. The possibility of a later 
“condensation” of events certainly 
does exist. 

I can’t help but end this on a 
note of personal curiosity. Which 
side am I on, that of Mr. Osborn 
or his opponent?

OU’RE not allowed in 
the ambulance,” Miss 
B Knox said. 

They were both ts^aical adver- 
tising men, down to the motor- 



skates strapped beneath their 
shoes. Their faces were so utterly 
undistinctive as to seem fuzzy. 
Each carried a large flat briefcase 
with a coil antenna sticking out. 



The Royalty Party wasn't what you would 
imagine — it stood for a great deal, but 
there was as much it wanted no part of! 



113 



“Watch it!” the attendant 
growled, and they skated aside 
with a whir. 

Big Carl came driving up the 
ramp, ducked his head to enter, 
and brought the bed to a stop in 
the belly of the ambulance. Miss 
Knox pressed the button and the 
door closed in the admen’s faces. 

When Mr. Barger was lowered 
from the hovering ambulance, his 
swollen, tearful eyes were svm- 
blind. Square hands clenched over 
and over with pain. Above the 
rotors’ rackety-rackety-rack, Miss 
Knox shouted soothing things. She 
didn’t wait for an answer. He was 
the worst case of laryngitis ^e had 
ever known — the only case, real- 
ly, in her professional experience. 
Abolished diseases always came 
back virulently. 

She and the bed sank between 
white hospital walls and landed 
in the room with a bump. The 
waiting attendant walked around 
the platform, folding the safety 
gates. He unhooked the four sufj- 
port cables, each vanishing out of 
his grasp like spaghetti slurped 
from a plate. 

Just as the ceiling closed over- 
head, cutting off sight and soimd 
of the whirlybird against the sun. 
Brooks, the radiologist, came in 
through the door, shepherding an 
entire class of medical students. 
Then two nurses seemed to clear 
an inoffensive path through the 
chemically tainted air of the cor- 



ridor — and after them came Dr. 
Gesner, the greatest throat man 
in the country. Miss Knox knew 
him from his portrait in the Mush- 
room. 

Brooks winked her an “At easel” 
with a shaggy eyebrow and fol- 
lowed the fat man through the 
crowd. Dr. Gesner went to tiie bed 
and sat down. He was Barger’s 
weight, with the same sort of ele- 
phantine bones, but he was almost 
two feet shorter. He stared at the 
nose and cheeks protruding from 
the bedclothes, and opened a fat 
black bag. 

A bell rang three times in 
the corridor. Five internes 
scurried into the room and stopped 
still, watching Dr. Gesner as 
though he were a golden calf. On 
each side of the doorway stood 
a student nurse at attention. 

Mr. Barger stopped twitching 
and opened one eye wide. His chin 
lifted, and his other chins came 
out from under the sheet’s folded 
edge. 

One of Dr. Gesner’s hands felt 
through the black bag. It emerged 
dragging a mutape by one wire. 
Brooks leaned forward and took 
out the rest of the apparatus. 
Shaking the hair off his forehead, 
he plugged into the bedside com- 
puter relay and placed the rubber- 
rimmed cup against the patient’s 
skull, just over the Broca convolu- 
tion. 



114 



GALAXY 



Mr. Barger remained staring at 
the doctor through a gray film. 
The mutape chattered rapidly. 
Miss Knox craned her neck, de- 
ciphering the punched tape as it 
unrolled from the recorder in 
Brooks’ hands. Sweat popped out 
on Mr. Barger’s forehead. 

“Help me, damn it,” read Mr. 
Barger’s tape. “I know you. You 
abolished laryngitis; why should it 
come to me now? I have a right 
to stop misuse of my work and to 
be free from pain — my patent is 
vital — free from pain. I want to 
be free . .” His face turned pink 
in a new contortion and the hands 
folded over. 

“Yes,” Dr. Gesner said as the 
chatter stopped. “I know it hurts.” 
He smiled gently in the middle of 
his face. He was writing on an in- 
dex card, but his main effort was 
devoted to getting up from the 
bed with the help of two internes. 
“It will hurt this badly for twen- 
ty-four hours. Then the injection 
will have the upper hand.” He 
turned to Brooks. “Please pass the 
tape around. Doctor. If any stu- 
dents haven’t seen the X-rays yet, 
they’re in my file.” 

Mr. Barger’s face grayed a lit- 
tle; the sweat had turned to 
patches of crust against his skin. 
Dipping cotton in alcohol. Miss 
Knox bathed his forehead. 

“That’s all,” said Dr. Gesner, 
handing her the card as the stu- 
dents began to vanish. 

DON'T LOOK NOW 



She stalked after him. “No 
examination. Doctor?” she asked, 
ignoring Brooks’ horrified expres- 
sion. 

“Unnecessary, Nurse.” He 
backed away from her and the 
door slid open. “I’ve already seen 
the X-rays and charts you phoned 
from the ambulance. And the pa- 
tient cannot open his mouth. His 
intravenous menu is all here . .” 

“Yes, Doctor.” 

Three bells sounded in the cor- 
ridor. “Calling Dr. Gesner. Emer- 
gency. Please come to the tele- 
phone. Emergency. Calling Dr. 
Gesner . .” 

He rolled his eyes at the index 
card in her hand. “You yourself are 
to take the shots prescribed for you, 
to prevent your catching or carry- 
ing the disease. In that bed, but for 
the grace of God . .” He was cry- 
ing softly. 

“Doctor!” said Brooks, and the 
internes and nurses gasped. 

“After all,” said Dr. Gesner, “I 
did abolish laryngitis.” 

'jVI’ ISS Knox walked back up the 
■*-*-*^ drive and struck a cigarette 
on one of the stone lions. It glowed 
in the dark, but the river breeze 
blew it out before she could draw. 
She snorted in annoyance. 

Miss Erwin looked up sharply. 

“Is there anywhere where you 
can still buy matches?” asked Miss 
Knox. 

“Not in New York City. Why?” 



115 



“We used to just try again when 
a cigarette didn’t light Now we 
have to throw it away.” 

“Of course,” said Miss Erwin. 
“That’s how they train us to be 
right the first time.” 

“Ridiculous. That’s how they 
sell more cigarettes.” 

“Why, Miss Knox! You sound 
like Royalty!” 

Miss Boiox laughed. “I’m not 
ready to join the British Common- 
wealth yet. No fooling, Hilda, you 
see the Silvertongue cigarette fac- 
tory across the river?” 

Miss Erwin twisted white-gloved 
hands in the dark. “Why, no . 
mmm, smell that spray.” An ocean- 
breathing tugboat passed, its com- 
plicated silhouette blocking the 
view. “No-oooooo,” the whistle 
blew. 

“Just wait till that tug is gone. 
There, Miss Erwin. Do you see 
the Silvertongue factory? Just be- 
fore the Williamsburg Bridge.” 

“Is it the one with the new radio 

— the radio-thing on top?” 
“Radiocompressor. Yes.” 

“They used to put names on 

those factories. All lit up.” 

“Well, ladies — ladies,” said a 
gravel voice beyond the entrance 
lights. “How is life in the Toad- 
stool?” 

“Boney!” said Miss Knox. 

“The what?” asked Miss Erwin. 
“That’s what Dr. Brooks called 
it. Now you tell me what he meant 

— he wouldn’t say. Toadstool.” 



“Come into the light, Boney — 
you frighten us,” said Miss Erwin. 

The man appeared, smiling, and 
climbed the first stone step. Resting 
his elbows on the lion and his chin 
in his hand, he looked down on 
them sideways. 

“Not another new suit,” said 
Miss Knox. 

It was an archaic double- 
breasted suit in good condition. 
Where the jacket hiked up in back, 
a wide expanse of extra trouser seat 
had been folded over and tucked 
beneath the belt 

“Hundred-fifty-dollar suit,” he 
said. 

“With or without the bottle?” 
asked Miss Knox. 

“What bottle?” 

“The one that bangs on your 
ribs when the breeze blows.” 

“Now listen here, lady . .” He 
came down the step. 

“Boney, I’m only kidding. You 
know that.” 

“Kidding. Kidding. And here I 
was giving you inside information. 
Inside information.” 

“What information?” 

Bringing his drawn face so close 
that they could smell the wine, he 
gave both women a look of scorn. 
Then he backed away and leaned 
his padded shoulder against the 
lion. 

“Boney, she’s sorry,” said Miss 
Erwin. 

“I am not,” said Miss Knox. 



116 



GALAXY 



H e glowered at her and walked 
away into the dark, his spider 
legs dissolving sooner than ex- 
pected. Then he marched back. 

“Sorry,” he said. “Ha. I won’t tell 
you. I’m going to tell it to the Direc- 
tor himself.” 

“Forget it, Boney. He’d throw 
you out again. You’d better just tell 
us.” 

His skeleton hand stretched to- 
ward the water. “You see that radio 
presser?” 

“You mean the new radiocom- 
pressor on the Silvertongue fac- 
tory?” 

“Rad/ocompressor. All right. Do 
you ladies know what it does?” 
“Anything,” Miss Knox said. 
“Our patient, Mr. Barger, builds 
them. He told us all about it the 
moment he came. In Greek.” 

“Not — not all about it. I know 
all about it. I had a big deal going 
— my Armenian partner and me, 
we were buying up neckties to sell 
in the hospital . .” 

“What do you know? And will 
you stop blowing in my face?” 

He glowered. 

“I’m sorry, Boney.” 
“Radiocompressors can do things 
— any things — without touching. 
Like rolling cigarettes or chopping 
up tobacco. The radio waves are so 
small they — push things.” He 
pushed the air with his left hand. 
“Not just go through them.” He 
wiggled the brittle fingers of his 
right. 



“Everyone knows that,” said 
Miss Knox. “What you mean is 
that the supra-short wave has an in- 
tense direct effect on matter. It was 
in all the papers.” 

“Oh, is that so? Is that so? Well, 
you listen to me. This isn’t in all 
the papers.” 

“All right, go on.” Miss Knox 
struck a cigarette, which blew out 
She threw it down and succeeded in 
lighting another. 

“You can fool people, also, with 
the same radio waves,” said Boney. 

“You mean hide behind the door 
with a wave compressor and push 
chairs around? Like that?” 

“Don’t be silly. Nothing like that. 
Dr. Brooks told me today, when I 
was sweeping his private lab in the 
Toadstool, he told me they make 
one kind where if you put it on a 
table, say, no one can see what else 
is there. You could put — a cat on 
the table, and anyone would think 
it was just a table with a radio 
presser. Until the cat jumped off. 
Then you could see it.” 

“Can it jump off? asked Miss 
Knox. 

“Can it jump off? Did you ever 
see a cat that couldn’t jump? And 
that’s not all—” 

“Quite a trick,” she said. 

“No trick. You could rule the 
world with that, ladies. Think 
about it. Rule the world. Got a ciga- 
rette? After all, I always get you 
coffee.” 

She handed him one. 



DON’T LOOK NOW 



117 



Miss Erwin stared across the 
river. “I hope it isn’t a new kind of 
bomb,” she said. 

Boney pulled out a stick match 
and struck it on the stone lion. Cup- 
ping his hands around the flame, he 
lit up and walked away. 

66p>UT, Dr. Brooks, when you 
tell Boney things like that,” 
said Miss Knox, “he believes them, 
and he quotes you like mad. Don’t 
you care about your reputation at 
all?” 

“My dear woman,” Dr. Brooks 
replied, “I’ve been interested in 
many things in my years, but get- 
ting my portrait in the Mushroom 
has never been one of them—” 

Mr. Barger’s legs spasmed sud- 
denly and shot straight out, jerking 
the covers from his fat-layered 
neck. But the pink shut eyelids 
hadn’t quivered. 

and, anyway, Boney is right,” 
Dr. Brooks finished. “Why do you 
think the Royalties want govern- 
ment control of the whole inven- 
tion?” 

Miss Knox was tucking the 
covers around his warm, sticky 
jowls. “But he said you said—” 

“I said she said we said.” Brooks 
grabbed her chin between his 
thumb and forefinger. “Did you 
know that machine on the Silver- 
tongue roof could get at us inside 
our own homes?” 

She shook her head, swinging his 
arm from side to side. 



“If you know nothing about it; 
girlie, let me explain.” He squeezed 
her chin titter. “You saw those 
two men from the Christian E. 
Lodge Corporation — Silvertongue, 
that is — who came this afternoon 
to see Barger? The ones on motor- 
skates?” 

“They shouldn’t allow those 
buzzing things in the hospital. They 
make more noise than a whirly- 
bird.” She backed away, tugging 
at the white-coated arm until her 
chip was released. “I mean I saw 
them yesterday. They tried to get 
in the bird. I don’t know why they 
visit him — he can’t say a word. 
Doesn’t he have a family?” 

“No, but the Silvertongue men 
love him like a brother. Barger de- 
signed their radiocompressor — the 
one in all the newspapers. Here, 
you can see it from the window if 
you—” 

“I know. Dr. Brooks.” 

“Do you know what that ma- 
chine can really do, girlie?” 

‘When I was your age—” Miss 
Knox began. 

“You are. I just look yoimg. That 
machine can cure and shred tobac- 
co with supra-short waves on a 
polished magnesium bowl, just the 
way the papers say, but they have 
cheaper ways to process their to- 
bacco. They really use the machine 
for guided tours of the factory. Pub- 
lic relations.” 

“You mean float visitors through

“No. You’d need flie power of 
ten maritime atomic piles in series 
just to lift Dr. Gresner to the height

“Very funny!” 

his own square root What 
they can do with that machine is 
to disguise an object — say the in- 
coming leaf tobacco. They can 
make it look firm, golden, and so 
forth. The girls at the sorting tables, 
wherever the guided tour happens 
to be, will all look like Norma Nor- 
den. They’ll be dressed as angels 
and work in heaven. Then the 
V.I.P.S can tour the girls’ homes 
and dormitories, and instead of a 
dirty slum, they’ll see — they’ll see 
mushrooms, if they like.” 

“How is it done?” 

“Only Barger Electronics really 
knows,” said Dr. Brooks, “and the 
Christian E. Lodge engineers. It’s 
something to do with compressing 
the wave length to approximate 
that of light, SO that images are can- 
celed out. This leaves a clear field 
for subliminal techniques. If there 
are subvisual images projected on 
the walls, for instance, that’s what 
the observers will see inside the 
room.” 

“Oh, my God!” exclaimed Miss 
Knox. 

“The only other thing I know 
is that it has to be done with in- 
tersecting spheres. The machine 
has two portable secondary trans- 
mitters — or projectors, or what- 
ever they call them — each emitting 



in all directions to form a wave- 
sphere. Where the two spheres 
overlap, you get your possible in- 
terference with light” 

“Frankly, I just don’t imder- 
stand it” 

“Any radio waves go out in all 
directions to form spheres.” His 
voice had become a mutter. “You 
know that.” 

“No, I didn’t.” 

¥TE gave a false sigh. ‘Well, take 
an ordinary weak phone 
transmitter very high up in a 
whirlybird. That’s the simplest 
case. You know what sound a 
whirlybird makes, don’t you?” 
“Of course,” said Miss Knox. 
“What?” Dr. Brooks challenged, 
moving at her. “How does it 
sound?” 

“Oh, clatter-clatter chug-chug,” 
she said, moving back. 

“No. Listen closely and you’ll 
hear any whirlybird — especially 
hospital ambulances — go rackety- 
rackety-rack groiindhog, rackety- 
rack groundhog! — a reminder to 
people that they belong on the 
ground, one may assume. Picture a 
microphone attached outside the 
bird and wired to your transmitter. 
'Die radio waves go out in all di- 
rections through the air. Suppose 
your air is all of the same density, 
and so forth — then all the waves 
peter out at a constant radius and 
form a perfect sphere going 
rackety-rackety-rack ground-hog!

“Now compressed waves travel 
a certain number of feet — theo- 
retically, the number of foot- 
poimds of work the power input 
could perform modified by a con- 
stant value called ‘e’ — and at that 
point they revert to ordinary radio 
waves. This forms a sphere of 
compressed or supra-short waves. 
Do you understand that?” 

“No,” said Miss Knox. 

“Well, anyway, where two 
spheres overlap, you get the Bar- 
ger effect. And they can vary or 
limit the effect in interesting ways. 
Just move one or both projectors 
so that the waves intersect each 
other in different phases—” 

“That’s a fascinating way to 
back me into a corner of the 
room. Dr. Brooks. Now will you 
please let me look at my patient?” 
Mr. Barger’s body convulsed 
and twitched, and the disordered 
bedclothes exposed the pink, 
swollen layers of his throat. Only 
the face slept. Miss Knox reduced 
the feed on the water envelope, 
and with her palm brushed drops 
of moisture from the burning, out- 
of-focus pink skin. The drops 
were sticky and warm. She wiped 
her hands on a piece of cotton and 
started to prepare the blood trans- 
fusion. 

“Before you get out of here,” 
she said to Dr. Brooks, “let me 
thank you.” 

“For the information? You’ll 
only forget it” 



“No, for the crack about my 
age.” 

Slumping his eyebrows, he went 
to the door and stepped through 
almost before it could slide open. 

“Wait!” she commanded in a 
stage whisper. 

He appeared, the door sliding 
back harmlessly against his shoul- 
der before it changed direction. 

“What’s so terrible?” she asked. 
“You talk as though that radio- 
compressor on the Silvertongue 
roof were going to destroy the 
American home, at the very least.” 

“They don’t just have to trans- 
mit within the factory,” he said. 
“Suppose they wanted you ar- 
rested. Say they didn’t like bru- 
nettes. Well, first they get some 
dame to call police and say she’s 
going to do a strip in front of the 
Psychiatric Pavilion wall. Then 
they go across First Avenue and 
set up a subliminal movie se- 
quence of some stripper in action 
and focus it on the wall from their 
car. They set up two portable 
wave projectors and adjust their 
phasing to achieve the Barger ef- 
fect in that one place. Then they 
wait for you to pass that spiot on 
your way to church. Very little 
power is required; the actual 
radiocompression takes place 
across the river.”

the knees and minced across the 
room, exposing curly hair above 
his fallen argylls. His white coat

^rang. 

■ The telephone. Trying to recap- 
ture something she had known, 
she let groping fingers stretch to- 
ward the instrument. They de- 
scended, clenched, lifted. The 
ringing stopped. 

She forced her eyes open far 



enough to see her white arm re- 
turn. Hunching up around her pil- 
low with the receiver, she croaked, 
“Hello.” 

“Miss Knox?” A high voice. 
“Boney — it’s Boney— ” 

“You have a nerve, Boney, to 
wake me up at this hour.” 

“This isn’t Boney — it’s Hilda 
Erwin. I’m on emergency duty and 
they’ve brought in Boney. His 
throat is cut—” 

“No! Is he alive?” 

“Yes, yes. But he may never 
speak again. He lay there in the 
street for hoius and hours. Dr. 
Gesner’s internes are here—” 

“Oh, not being able to talk 
would be worse for him than dy- 
ing. I’ll come! I’ll be right there!” 
Miss Knox dropped the receiver 
and swung out of bed, feeling in 
the darkness for her robe. She 
pulled it on and opened the door, 
and found her slippers in the faint 
yellow light from the hallway. 

As she ran, knotting the belt of 
her robe, she looked up and down 
the ancient residential corridors 
for a motorbed. She stumbled 
against a rotten wood molding. 
She pressed the elevator button 
and turned, her loose hair swing- 
ing heavily, to face the flat eye of 
a clock. It was five-fifteen. 

Overhead, the floor indicator 
creaked around its dial — seven, 
six, five, four — and the doors 
opened. There was a motorbed 
on the elevator.

She stepped inside and pressed 
the button for seven, the lowest 
floor with a bridge to the Mush- 
room. The doors shut and the car 
moved upward. Tripping over the 
torn linoleum, she managed to fall 
backward onto the bed’s driving 
seat. She swung her legs aroimd 
and turned on the switch. 

As the doors opened, she drove 
out with a jolt and entered the 
sparkling newness of a tubular 
bridge which rose through the 
night across First Avenue. The 
Mushroom towered overhead, its 
spiral corridors glowing. Night 
traffic vibrated beneath her as she 
crossed — a crowd of trucks was 
baying north along the hidden cob- 
blestones, following traffic lights 
which jumped from red to green, 
one after another, like "'an elec- 
tronic rabbit. The trucks passed 
out of sight under their own diesel 
cloud and another pack ap- 
proached in a higher key . 

Then a lurch as towing cables 
grated and took hold in the curve 
of the many-windowed corridor. 
Whining under glass, the motor- 
bed veered off in a rising circle 
around the stem of the Mushroom. 
Around and around again, faster, 
while room numbers flashed red 
one by one on the silver doors, 
over the river, over the roof gar- 
den of the Administration wing, 
over the river, over the garden, 
around and around and out, out — 
far out over a city of dark crum- 



bling toys and up and up over the 
rim . 

Q HE approached the great trans- 
^ parent dome of the Mushroom 
looking ahead into the sky, as 
though enemies in immense dis- 
tance were triangulating upon her. 
An echo of voices rolled out. Far 
across the marble floor, one of 
the emergency rooms had its lights 
on. The door opened and a tiny 
figure in a motorchair sped out 
and along the wall, followed by 
a line of running dolls in white. 
Some of them clustered around 
the man in the chair, waving their 
arms. Thinning like a comet’s tail, 
the procession vanished down the 
south escalator. The door of the 
room slid shut. 

She hurtled across beneath the 
stars and drove straight at the 
room, applying brakes sharply 
with a tightening in her stomach 
as the door began to open. Her 
long hair swept forward against 
her cheeks and shoulders. She 
jarred to a stop inside and rose, 
refocusing her senses on the en- 
closed white space. 

The bedside table held a pot 
of paper geraniums. Something lay 
beneath the covers like lumber on 
edge, the angles of knees project- 
ing sideways. Out of the sheets 
stuck part of a thin white drain- 
pipe neck and a face like a broken 
roof shingle, over which the weep- 
ing Miss Erwin cast her shadow.

Brooks sat hunched over the 
stool, fingers buried in his hair. 
His lab coat was twisted awry; a 
bare knee protruded between two 
buttons. 

“What happened? asked Miss 
Knox. 

“He’s all right,” Miss Erwin 
sobbed at her. “Delinquents— van- 
dals — they cut his throat by the 
river, right in front of the hospital. 
The mutape says — he didn’t — 
see their faces.” 

“Don’t worry about him,” said 
a low muttered voice. “He’s been 
conscious. The doctors say he’ll 
speak, in time.” Dr. Brooks had 
raised his head and was trying to 
cover himself with the lab coat. 

“River rats,” Miss Knox snapped, 
peering at Boney’s wasted face. 
“What do you mean, in time?” 
“Two or three weeks. An expert 
job of quick surgery, really.” 
“No! No!” Miss Erwin broke 
into a fit of sobbing and blindly 
rearranged the flowers. 

“Do you mean to say?—” 
“Some medical students on a 
horror spree. Damned age of — 
what did that Washington press 
secretary say? — ‘atomic hyper- 
specialization’! That means young 
brains growing in channels until 
they explode through the wall. 
You remember the physicist who 
killed his colleagues when the 
English won the Nobel Prize.” 

“It can’t be,” said Miss Knox. 
She watched the hurt man grimace 



somewhere along his razor edge 
of nightmare. 

“It’s the only likelihood. Well, 
we can’t do anything for him now, 
and you look a little beat. Come 
on. I’ll buy you coffee from the 
vending machine on the Adminis- 
tration roof.” 

Dr. Brooks stood up, lifted Miss 
Knox gently beneath the arms 
and sat her on the motorbed, then 
swung a hairy shin over the driv- 
ing seat. They rolled through the 
doorway. 

‘Who was that big shot in the 
motorchair?” Miss Knox asked. 
“Dr. Gesner?” 

Dawn had just begun to spread. 
They crossed within a widening 
circle of mushroom-shaped arches 
containing portraits which drew 
farther away until they resembled 
portal guards, and then converged 
again in full austerity on the oppo- 
site side of the great dome. 

“Director himself — they can’t 
reach Gesner anyplace,” Brooks 
said. 

T hey started to descend in- 
ward from the Mushroom’s 
edge. Numbers flashed by as they 
spiraled down faster along the 
self-steering guide rail. Over the 
river, over the garden. Over the 
river . 

She leaned back against the 
pillows. ‘What was himself doing 
in the hospital at this hour?” she 
asked.

“As a matter of fact” — his 
shadow crossed her face as he 
moved the deceleration lever— “he 
was with me.” 

“With you?”. 

“I was listening to the newscasts 
in bed. He came to see me be- 
cause, as resident radiologist, I’m 
the only person who knows any- 
thing at all about electronics. 
While we listened, his assistant 
with the high voice called him on 
my phone and told him about 
Boney.” 

“How did he react?” 

Brooks swung his tiller bar and 
they veered onto the roof of the 
Administration wing, the door be- 
hind them cutting off all light from 
inside the Mushroom. They were 
in a formal garden filled with 
scent, and surrounded by distant 
hedges. The few remaining stars 
were surprised naked, floating 
above a monstrous concrete bird- 
bath. 

“Like a bureaucrat,” he mut- 
tered as they rolled to a stop. 
“First he requisitioned flowers. 
He’s probably in here somewhere 
now, plotting revenge against the 
Commissary clerk who issued the 
knife they found near Boney. I 
know he’d love to see you rushing 
in your bathrobe to other people’s 
emergencies.” 

“Disgusting. And they call him 
die Father of the Mushroom. Big 
shot.” 

“Why?” he asked. “After all, he 



is a bureaucrat How did you your- 
self react — like a woman, no?” 
He helped her down. They 
walked within a double row of 
mountain laurels to the coffee ma- 
chine. 

“I’d forgotten all about the bath- 
robe,” she said. “Black for me.” 
“One day soon,” he muttered, 
“they’ll build him a mushroom 
he’ll never see the end of. Sand- 
wich? Anything?” 

“No.” She took the warm plastic 
cup and sipped. It was bad coffee. 
Far below, a snort of traffic echoed 
down First Avenue. “I’ve only 
been here once before. I’m a bit 
lower-echelon for the Administra- 
tive roof.” 

“Who isn’t?” 

She looked past the white-on- 
red Emergency Exit sign to a 
wrought-iron gate in the hedge fac- 
ing the river. “Look, the Silver- 
tongue factory is all lit up. Every 
single window on the top floor.” 
“I should think so. You mean 
you don’t know?” 

“Know what?” 

“My heavens, the fate of man’s 
grasp on reality is being decided 
tonight! Congress was still in spe- 
cial session at five a.m. — still is, 
as far as I know.” 

“Session over what? Don’t tell

“Visual interference by radio 
wave compression. Yesterday the

cial session. There is at present no

law to prevent the Christian E. 
Lodge Corporation from buying 
the right to tamper with light 
waves in the home, for advertising 
purposes or — God knows what 
other kinds of control.” 

“I didn’t know. I was on duty 
with Mr. Barger and then no one 
told me.” 

“Barger was against it,” said Dr. 
Brooks. “He sold them the device 
with a set of conditions on its use, 
but now they’re buying the patent 
outright.” 

“But — don’t they have to wait 
for him? Barger Electronics is his 
company.” 

“No. He’s chairman of the 
board, but any three or more di- 
rectors can sell the patent. Once 
it’s sold, there will be nothing Con- 
gress can do.” 

“Why?” asked Miss Knox, star- 
ing out over the water. Some of 
the Silvertongue windows had 
winked out. The others vanished 
together, leaving only a pale ver- 
tical row to mark the fire stairs. 

Three bells sounded. 

“Your attention please!” — a 
piping male voice. 

Brooks said, “I’ll bet it’s the 
Director himself.” 

“In a moment,” shrilled the 
voice, “we will time in the broad- 
cast direct from Washington so 
that all personnel can hear history 
in the making. After the congres- 
sional vote. Dr. Hamilton, our 
director, will honor us with a few 



words here in the hospital, which 
he will repeat later for the benefit 
of the day shift.” 

There was a ringing tone, growl- 
ing in volume like the approach 
of motorskates. 

“I told you,” Brooks shouted 
over the noise. “His family has 
stock in Silvertongue.”

“Barger engineers have been with-

“Too late,” said Brooks. “That’s

“Bear with me now. I do not

voice from within the hospital said, 
“we will tune in again when the

A long pause filled with buzzing. 
“People,” said the Director, and 
the buzzing ended. “There is no 
war. Let me repeat; there is no 



atomic war going on.” He paused. 

“Now there has been a lot of 
fuss over a steel tower on a fac- 
tory across the river. I want to 
make it clear that no advertising 
gimmicks will change our job here. 
All hospitals — public, like ours, 
or even our esteemed allies, the 
private hospitals — are bound by 
medical and staff ethics to pay no 
official attention to the world of 
advertising, 

“I am especially amazed by ru- 
mors that Nat Bonaparte, or 
‘Boney,’ who does clean-up work 
here from time to time, was si- 
lenced because he ‘knew some- 
thing’ about this wonderful adver- 
tising gimmick. Nothing can be 
sillier. It just happens that the fel- 
low left my office shortly before 
he must have been wounded by 
delinquents from the nearby 
slums. He was giving me ‘inside 
information,’ as he called it, about 
light-ray guns, and mechanical 
hypnotism, and plots against the 
patients. These, apparently, are 
the things which Boney ‘knew,’ 
and he has been talking endlessly 
about them since I first came into 
office, and presumably before.” 

Brooks struck two cigareettes 
against his pack and handed one 
to Miss Knox. Their first puff ob- 
scured his puzzled frown. 

“This fuss I am talking about,” 
continued the Director, “has been 
taken as grounds for wild infringe- 
ment of any and all regulations by

“Get on the bed,” said Dr.

“Furthermore, any private or 
unauthorized use of this or other 
hospital equipment may be 'pim- 
ished by immediate dismissal—” 
Miss Knox took a step toward 
the motorbed. “I’d like to look in 
on Mr. Barger.” 

“—with particular application to 
the young woman who used a mo- 
torbed tonight to visit a sick 
friend.” 

Miss Knox stood feet apart, 
hands on hips. “The dirty son of 
a bitch,” she said.

across the Mushroom, white 
pumps clacketing half off her feet. 
“Oh!” she said, and stopped, pant- 
ing. “Has the world really been 
taken over by admen?” 

Brooks stopped the motorbed. 
“Just America,” he said, “and only 
a few admen.” He helped Miss 
Knox down and they all walked 
toward the emergency rooms. 



“Boney is fine, Dr. Brooks,” said 
Miss Erwin. “He just went back to 
sleep. But Mr. Barger is not feel- 
ing well.” 

“Is Mr. Barger awake?” 

“Oh, no. Doctor, but he was 
moaning. A sort of breath-moan, 
with his eyes still shut. Dr. Feld 
took a mutape and said he wasn’t 
getting regular delirium patterns 
at all.” 

“Has Dr. Gesner been here?” 
“We’ve tried and tried to reach 
him, but he left no word with his 
office or at home. His nurses are 
terribly worried about him, and 
his wife — oh. Miss Knox, do you 
suppose he drinks?” Miss Erwin’s 
forehead grew a splotch of pink. 
“Oh, I’m sorry. Doctor! I’m ter- 
ribly upset.” 

“Go home, Hilda,” said Miss 
Knox. “I can handle things — I 
go on in less than an hour, any- 
way. Let’s foul up Hamilton’s 
schedule.” 

“Oh, Miss Knox!” 

“Just one more thing — before 
you go to bed, get a uniform from 
my room and give it to Miss 
Kelly, to bring with her when she 
comes up for day shift. If my 
door is open, close it.” 

“Here’s a key.” Dr. Brooks said. 
“Give it to one of the attendants 
in the dining room. If no one’s eat- 
ing breakfast yet, leave it with

want some linens and a suit —

“What color socks. Doctor?” 
“Any color.”

room doesn’t suit her looks.”

: Kjiox. “What’s-his-name who de- 
signed it — you know, the one who 
did the museums — was ninety-

Brooks. 

“Can I do an 5 dhing for you?

- muttered.

shoulder. 

“They’ve gotten their tapes 
crossed! That idiot Feld must 
have had this in his machine when 
he came. It’s some accident vic- 
tim’s tape — one hundred per cent 
unverbalized pain, and the vic- 
tim was wide awake when he made 
it. It might be Boney’s tape. This 
man here has been in coma since 
this — since yesterday morning, 
thank heaven.” 

“Poor Boney,” said Miss Knox, 
adjusting Mr. Barger’s covers and 
her own loose hair. As though in 



answer, Mr. Barger stirred feebly, 
raising his arm. 

“Honey, there isn’t much we 
can do,” said Dr. Brooks. 

“You’re right.” She glanced 
down and plucked at the bath- 
robe around her smooth lace-bor- 
dered throat. “Can’t save the world 
in my old nightgown.” 

He took her by the shoulders 
and bent his head toward the pal- 
pitating muscle in her throat. 

Leaning back against the edge 
of the bed, she held him at arm’s 
length. She wet her lips and said, 
“Did I tell you Fm supposed to 
wear glasses?” 

He sprawled forward into her 
embrace. Her dark mane tumbled 
thickly over Mr. Barger. They 
twisted and pulled each other 
down to the floor, freeing loose 
strands of hair from the blanket’s 
electricity. 

S HE opened her eyes and saw a 
flat briefcase with a coil an- 
tenna sticking out 

“What’s the matter?” whispered 
Dr. Brooks. 

“On the bottom of the bed!” 

He pressed his cheek to the 
floor and examined the under-car- 
riage of Mr. Barger’s motorbed. 

“Projector!” He reached in and 
tugged at the object, bracing his 
other hand against the driveshaft 
“Help me, quick!”

he slid under the bed and ham- 
mered with his fist. “It’s hooked 
on the other way,” she said. He 
pulled, and the briefcase fell heavi- 
ly to the floor. 

Dr. Brooks rolled to his feet, 
kicking the object into the light, 
and yanked at its buckles and 
straps. “My bag is somewhere near

the chair. Get the mutape on him, 
fast!” 

She found his black satchel on 
the floor, plugged into the com- 
puter outlet and spread the ap- 
paratus over Mr. Bargee’s bed. 
She made a trembling fist around 
the Broca cup, and watched the 
dormant pink cheeks and eyelids

as she lowered the cup toward his 
skull. 

The rubber rim thudded against 
empty air, pleating like a horse’s 
muzzle as she pushed. The sleep- 
ing Barger face remained a picture 
glowing out of reach inches be- 
neath her straining fist, behind a 
smell of blood. A hand from imder

the covers grasped her wrist . 

She struggled. Dr. Brooks, at the 
telephone, contorted his face and 
heaved the briefcase against the 
wall. It diattered into coils and 
smashed tubes and pieces of elec- 
tronic chassis like a shower of 
silver Christmas ornaments, and 
a moan from the bed faded away.

Brooks shouted and hung up 
the phone. The mutape was chat- 
tering violently. He unlocked the 
door, flung himself to the bed and 
took the recorder between his 
hands. The grasp on her wrist re- 
laxed, and she leaned over to de- 
cipher the punched tape as it im- 
rolled from the machine. Its dot 
patterns were unverbalized bloody 
agony, cleanly formulated in com- 
puter language. 

“He’ll verbalize,” Brooks said. 
“Just don’t look at him — thank 
God they’ve found Gesner.” 

A red, bloated forehead above 
eyes fixed on her own through 
lenses of gray fluid as it writhed 
and pressed up against the Broca 
cup in her fist. She covered her 
face, and between her fingers the 
sleeping Barger face still lay on 
its pillow. 

"TkR. BROOKS screwed his own 
features into a wink, and she 
turned away to watch the unroll- 
ing tape still chattering between 
his hands: “England is the only 
hope. We must go through im- 
mediately before direct control 
and defenses build against us — 
morphine, why did you not give 
me morphine? Pain is intolerable.” 
“Analgesics nullify the Gesner 
shots,” Brooks said. 

“Morphine,” chattered the tape, 
“worth it, worth it, cure me when 
we have left for England. And hur- 
ry, they want me alive, and as 



soon as they control the police . .• 

Turning under Dr. Brooks’ 
twisted glance as he took the 
Broca cup, she went to the sink 
and scrubbed her hands. She found 
the hypodermic and phial in the 
black satchel and measured two 
cc of clear tincture of morphine, 
and turned back to the arm which 
grasped Dr. Brooks’ wrist, press- 
ing the cup hard against a swollen 
red mass. She rolled up the sleeve 
of the hospital gown which led to 
a raised shoulder (she wouldn’t 
look at the face) and hesitated — 
another needle was already stuck 
in the muscle, protruding just 
above the skin. She foimd the vein 
and pushed the plunger in, and 
withdrew her needle. 

Dr. Brooks said, “Get that out 
of there.” 

She took tweezers from her 
bathrobe pocket and carefully re- 
moved an inch of broken hypo- 
dermic shaft. The blood spurted. 
She reached for cotton and alcohol. 

'Hiree bells rang in the corridor 
as the door slid open, and Miss 
Erwin came fluttering in. 

“Don’t look, Hilda!” warned 
Miss Knox. 

“Calling the emergency rooms,” 
said a piping voice. “Beware of 
patient William Barger who may 
attempt to escape. He may be 
armed . .” 

The mutape chattered. 

“Here, take the cup,” said Dr. 
Brooks. He picked up the bedside 



^air and placed it on the foot of 
fthe bed. Climbing onto the sway- 
'ing surface like a trained ape, he 
reached up and loosened the 
^crews which held the light globe 
in place on the ceiling, and threw 
it to shatter on the floor. Miss 
Erwin stepped backward. Then 
she tiptoed toward the light and 
steadied the chair, and stared at 
the patient’s face in fascination. 
Dr. Brooks was tugging at an ob- 
ject resembling a camera, attached 
by a spring clamp between the 
bulbs of the ceiling fixture. 

“Hilda!” Miss Knox said. 

“Oh, look at his face now!” 

“Subliminal picture slide,” said 
Dr. Brooks, dropping the object to 
tee floor with a crash. “There goes 
his sweet sleeping face — an illu- 
'sion filling in for reality because 
there was nothing else for us to 
see.” 

Mr. Barger’s face was blotched 
red and covered with shiny ooze. 
His throat was swollen as thick 
as his cheeks, with lumpy rolls of 
neck stretched taut like strands of 
pink beads above the bedsheet. His 
mouth was hidden beneath caked 
blood. 

The mutape read, “You are run- 
ning out of time.” 

Three bells in the corridor as 
the door slid open. “Calling Dr. 
Gesner,” said st cool nurse’s voice. 
“Emergency. Calling Dr. Feld. 
Emergency.” 

Five internes scurried in, sur- 



rounding the figure on the bed. 
Behind teem strode rawboned Dr. 
Feld in a red hunting jacket A 
motorchair rolled after him and 
stopped in the doorway, and an as- 
sistant administrator stood up and 
piped, “Hold him! He may be 
armed!” 

VI^ITH tee mutape chattering 
™ and Dr. Brooks bent close 
over the recorder. Miss Knox 
stood up and prepared her needle 
with penicillin from tee black 
satchel. 

“Don’t kill him,” the adminis- 
trator whined. 

Three bells in the corridor. “All 
personnel,” said the nurse’s voice. 
“Day shift, please take notice. Be- 
ware of a patient, armed, seeking 
to escape from the emergency 
floor. All hospital personnel. Be- 
ware of a patient . .” 

Big Carl kicked the motorchair 
out of the doorway, stepped 
through and handed Dr. Brooks a 
blue serge suit on a hanger. After 
him came a nurse carrying a white 
uniform and a paper bag. The 
room was filled with an echo of 
voices spreading across the Mush- 
room. 

“Step back,” said Dr. Feld, 
stumbling over an interne. 

Two student nurses came to the 
doorway and stood on either side, 
one with her hand in the photo- 
cell beam to keep the door from 
closing. The noise grew. 



132

“Calling Dr. Gresner,” said the 
cool nurse’s voice. 

A group of internes shuffled in- 
side, faces averted, moving side- 
ways in the crowd around the bed. 
Two attendants came striding up 
and stood on either side of the 
door, next to the student nurses. 

A class of medical students filed 
in and moved along the wall, the 
taller ones standing on tiptoe to 
see the patient. A bearded profes- 
sor in tweeds followed, whispering, 
“Here he comes, here he comes.” 
After a pause. Dr. Gesner wad- 
dled through the doorway between 
his nurses. Three internes came 
after with white coats flying open, 
the middle one a Hindu in a blue 
sash, and then a messenger boy 
calling, “Telegram for Dr. Ges- 
ner!” Three bells rang in the cor- 
ridor, and the door slid shut 
A path cleared before Dr. Ges- 
ner as he made his way to the bed. 
Helped to a sitting position, he 
opened the telegram which had 
been passed from interne to in- 
terne. 

“You don’t mind,” he said, turn- 
ing to the patient’s bloody face. 
He read the message and threw 
it away. “The police have been 
holding me for two days. Here my 
lawyers have a nice case against 
City Hall, just when this England 
business comes up — so you’re the 
man who’s dangerous and armed! 
I’m sure Hamilton isn’t responsible 
for that story.” 






Dr. Gesner had removed some 
of the cake with Miss Knox’s 
tweezers and was prodding the lip- 
less inflammation. 

“Wash this off as gently as you 
can,” said Dr. Gesner, and Miss 
Knox stepped forward. “And the 
antiseptic ointment in my bag — it 
has a purple label.” 

“I had to give him morphine,” 
said Dr. Brooks. 

“Ah — and some antibiotic?” 
“Penicillin,” said Miss Knox. 
“Ah. Now tell me, where is this 
other man who was put out of 
commission by these— these throat 
specialists? I’d like to examine 
him.” 

T he mutape chattered sudden- 
ly and then stopped. Dr. 
Brooks bent and read out loud, 
“Get those two on motorskates! I 
know them. They appear blond 
with their projector fields turned 
on; otherwise they are both nar- 
row-faced and dark.” 

Dr. Gesner smiled with just the 
middle of his face. “We caught 
them in the lobby on our way ia 
One of my lawyers is coming with 
us. His son plays right tackle — 
young lady!” He looked straight 
at Miss Knox. “I understand 
you’ve been talking about this 
business for days, along with our 
friend with the cut throat. You’ve 
been in danger — those two men 
were still in the building on your 
account, I’m sure. It’s a very good 



^ing you weren’t alone, you or 
Dr. Brooks. I take it you were 
iboth on night duty.” 

Dr. Brooks said, “If any of the 
iiurses or Dr. Gesner’s students 
don’t know what this is all about, 
I’m sure he’ll make an announce- 
ment when we’re all on the way 
to England. You must have some 
idea of what’s happened. If any- 
one doesn’t want to come, of 
course—” 

“Treason and insubordination!” 
piped a hidden voice. “Under the 
circumstances. Dr. Hamilton will 
have you jailed when he finds out 
(What you’re up to. Dr. Brooks.” 
Brooks stretched his arm be- 
tween two students and pulled a 
switch on the wall. The ceiling be- 
gan to open, sweeping bright sun- 
shine down the wall and making 
^etal buttons twinkle on Dr. 
Feld’s jacket. The ceiling slid back 
on rollers with a rumbling soimd, 
until nothing was overheard but 
the black dots of aircraft rising 
toward the sun. Nearby, a whirly- 
bird took off with a rackety-rack- 
ety-rackety-rack! 

“I phoned the Director,” Dr. 
Brooks told the crowd. “He’s not 
interfering. In fact, I’m pretty 
sure Dr. Hamilton will come.” 
“Dr. Feld,” said Dr. Gesner, 
“will you show the adman out?” 
“I’m not-” 

There was the sound of a blow 
and the assistant administrator ap- 
peared, scrabbling for his motor- 

DON’T LOOK NOW 



chair, which was buried among the 
students. His spindle limbs flailed 
from one side to the other until 
he was propelled from the room 
at a run, screaming, and the mes- 
senger boy vanished after him. 
Three bells rang in the corridor 
as the door closed. 

Dr. Gesner raised his hand and 
voices were stilled, the shuffle of 
feet ended and the mutape chat- 
tered alone in the sunshine. He 
leaned over and read the tape, and 
as he straightened his back, even 
the recorder stopped still. He 
heaved himself to his feet with 
the help of two internes. 

“He says—” puffed Dr. Gesner— 
he says this is no time for sadism.” 

UT AST ones up, girlie,” said Dr. 

^ Brooks. 

She sat on the bed and the mu- 
tape spoke to her noisily. Big Carl 
had hooked two cables in place. 
Dr. Brooks the other two, and the 
floor platform began to rise 
through the room toward the maw 
of the hovering whirlybird. She 
tucked the covers gently around 
her patient’s distorted throat 

The chatter stopped. She read, 
“This is something the Royalty 
predicted for weeks ahead of time. 
I thought we could avoid it, but 
the Silvertongue pe\aple must have 
fed me the virus at our last lun- 
cheon meeting. Then when nego- 
tiations remained uncertain —

my board — they came visiting 
while I slept and injected me with 
a larger dose and planted the pro- 
jectors. I woke up in awful pain. 
You were there, young lady — I 
screamed, silently, with my fea- 
tures. I was unable to raise my 
head. You wiped blood from my 
cheeks with your palm and cleaned 
it on a piece of cotton. You 
thought it was under water. Your 
eyes turned away before your 
hand left the projector field — 
or else you could not see what you 
could not expect. While I looked 
on, you treated me like a sleeping 
baby and asked Dr. Brooks about 
radio . .” The perforated tape 
had stopped feeding from the ma- 
chine. 

“His tape!” she cried. 

“Don’t worry,” Dr. Brooks said. 
“We’re unplugged from the hos- 
pital system, but I reserved the 
only ambulance with its own com- 
puter circuit. It conveys limited 
ideas, but that’s better than noth- 
ing.” 

Big Carl had erected the safe- 
ty gates. “Look below,” he said. 

She stood up and pressed her 
forehead to the latticework of the 
nearest gate. At first there was 
only a diamond-shaped patch of 
sky, with the Silvertongue factory 
in the bottom corner. Then, as 
the platforms swung on its cables, 
she saw the curved edge of the 
Mushroom, and the Administra- 
tion roof swarming with figures on 



motorskates. They circled among 
the squat mountain laurels, point- 
ing upward. The ambulance walls 
settled around her suddenly block- 
ing the view, and the belly of the 
vehicle rumbled shut With a 
bump, the floor platform was de- 
posited on its girders. 

Dr. Brooks said, “We’re away 
— I’ll have the pilot phone the 
others!” 

“Where’s the socket?” Miss 
Knox asked. “Mr. Barger and I 
were talking.” 

Dr. Brooks plugged into an 
overhead beam and the mutape 
immediately began to chatter; 
“What is your first name. Miss 
Knox?” 

“Della,” she said. 

“Pete Brooks.” 

“Carl,” the big man growled as 
he folded the gates. 

“Call me Bill,” said Mr. Bar- 
ger’s tape. Mr. Barger’s square 
hand motioned her closer beside 
him. “Della, do you know what we 
must do when we reach England? 
We must use the atom bomb first, 
before the admen have full con- 
trol. Only then may we return to 
the America we know. The real 
America.” 

“Do the English know?” asked 
Miss Knox. 

“Of course,” she said. “They 
heard the broaddasts, and their 
scientists understood. They have 
supported our Royalty Party for 
years. I think I could increase the 



136 



GALAXY 



range of my device and reach 
America before they reached Eng- 
land — but there is no time for 
that. The world must unite against 
invasion. Even the Russians know 
that there is no limit to the scope 
or methods of greedy marketing 
specialists”— the machine punched 
out a pattern of giggles and 
chuckles — “and I doul^ if the 
Russians could ever invent a 
radiocompressor.” 

“Are all the admen part of 
this?” 

“Absolutely not, young lady! 
The very great majority has al- 
ways followed a strict code of 
ethics that the very small minority 
has always subverted. Many 
ethical admen are in the birds 
now, on their way to England — 
knowing perfectly well that Eng- 
land is {X)or territory for emo- 
tional salesmanship.” 

“But why a Royalty Party in 
a democracy?” Miss Knox asked. 

“Royalty—” The tape showed 
amusement. “Not aristocracy. Roy- 
alty, as in share of and control 
over. Motto of the Royalty Party : 
‘The inventor is worthy of his in- 
vention,’ meaning the right to say 
how his discovery shall or shall 
not be used — or not be used at 
all, if it can only be destructive— 
as well as sharing in the proceeds. 
Unreasonable attitudes are not 
possible; we have an Appeals 
Board that can overrule a pig- 
headed patentee. Radiocompres- 



sors were intended for beautifica- 
tion of environment, not deception 
or thought control.” 

“Why England?” she persisted. 
“Pretty generally, the Royalty 
code is and has been standard pro- 
cedure there. Like their constitu- 
tion, it hasn’t had to be put in writ- 
ing.” 

“Aren’t there slums and unsight- 
ly monuments in England, too?” 
“Of course. Why do you think 
they would like to have the inven- 
tion? But it’s safe there; it won’t 
be subverted to thought control 
and sales engineering . Tell me, 
Della, is Dr. Gesner on this am- 
bulance? I would like to meet him.” 
- Dr. Brooks had come back from 
the control room. He sat beside 
her on the bed. “Dr. Gesner went 
ahead with Dr. Hamilton,” he said, 
“because you’re healthier than 
either one of them. But, Mr. Bar- 
ger — Bill — doesn’t light-wave 
interference need two overlapping 
projectors plus the subliminal 
image? We only found one.” 

The recorder chattered: “I am 
sure the other is also somewhere 
in the bed. It is harmless by itself, 
and I am glad we have it — it will 
help me instruct a team of British 
physicists and engineers. But who 
is in the other compartment? I 
hate to play chess with the same 
people over and over.” 

“I’m afraid he doesn’t play,” 
said Brooks. “I think it’s old 
Boney, who had his throat cut be- 



DON’T LOOK NOW 



137 



cause your friends thou^t he 
mi^t get you some help too soon.” 
The recorder punched out, “I 
would like to meet him,” as Miss 
Knox jumped from the bed, pull- 
ing Dr. Brooks by the arm. The 
machine chattered again briefly 
and she stopped and read, “Do 
not neglect me altogether,” and 
ran on. She opened the door to the 
other bed compartment. 

Miss Erwin fell on her with a 
cuddly embrace, and then Dr. 
Brooks reached over her shoulder 
to shake Miss Erwin’s hand. 
“How’s the patient?” he asked. 

Across the compartment, Boney’s 
face expanded in a three-cornered 
smile. 

“At least he slept,” said Miss 
Erwin. “That poor Mr. Barger — 
all the time we thought he was in 
coma, he was wide awake!” 

Miss Knox said, “Oh, my God!” 

HEAR more jets!” wailed 
Miss Erwin’s voice from 
the other room. “Why are they all 
flying home tonight, and we have 
to leave? Carl, are we — are we 
a quarter of the way to England?” 
“No,” Big Carl answered. 



Miss Knox called through the 
doorway, “This one won’t let me 
open the hatch!” 

Hunched across the bed, his 
hair falling over his forehead, Dr. 
Brooks played chess with Mr. Bar- 
ger. “Not in here,” he said. "You 
can open the emergency hatch in 
back if you like night air. But 
don’t expect to see the bombers 

— or anything but our own land- 
ing gear.” 

She slid past him and shut her- 
self into the small rear compart- 
ment and turned out the light. She 
felt for the emergency lock and 
swung her weight backward as the 
damp black air screamed in and 
tugged at her face — the whirly- 
bird showed its fat thigh with a 
rackety-rackety-rack ^round-hogl 
Tears ran down her cheeks, distort- 
ing her first view of darkness. 

Beyond the machine’s ungainly 
silhouette she peered and saw 
flashes of yellow light on water 

— but nothing, nothing familiar. 
Thus, squinting desperately to- 
ward home, she noticed it, mark- 
ing the horizon. A glowing mush- 
room. It must have been gigantic.

T he Power came to Lar- 
ry Snell suddenly and un- 
expectedly, out of nowhere. 
How and why it came to him, 
he never learned. It just came; 
that’s all. 

It could have happened to a 
nicer guy. Snell was a small-time 
crook — when he thought he could 
get away with stealing — but the 
bulk of his income, such as it was, 
came from selling numbers racket 
tickets and peddling marijuana to 
adolescents. He was fattish and

sloppy, with little close-set eyes 
that made him look almost as 
mean as he really was. 

His only redeeming virtue was 
cowardice. It had kept him from 
committing crimes of violence. 

He was, that night, talking to a 
bookie from a tavern telephone 
booth, arguing whether a bet he’d 
placed by phone that afternoon 
had been on the nose or across 
the board. Finally, giving up, 
he growled, “Drop dead,” and 
slammed down the receiver. He 



139 




thought nothing of it until the 
next day when he learned that the 
bookie had dropped dead . while 
talking on the telephone ... at 
just about the time of their con- 
versation. 

This gave Larry Snell food for 
thought. 

He was not an uneducated man; 
he knew what a whammy was. In 
fact, he’d tried whammies before, 
but they’d never worked for him. 
Had something changed? It was 
worth trying. Carefully he made 
out a list of twenty people whom, 
for one reason or another, he 
hated. He telephoned them one at 
a time — spacing the calls over the 
course of a week — and told each 
of them to drop dead. 

They did. All of them. 

It was not until the end of that 
week that he discovered that what 
he had was not simply the wham- 
my, but the Power. He was talk- 
ing to a dame, a top dame, a strip- 
tease working in a top nightclub 
and making twenty or forty times 
his own income, and he had said, 
“Honey, come up to my room after 
the last show, huh?” 

She did. 

It staggered him, because he’d 
been kidding. Rich men and hand- 
some playboys were after her, and 
she’d fallen for a casual, not even 
seriously intended, proposition 
from Larry Snell. 

Did he have the Power? He 
tried it the next morning, before 
140 






she left him. He asked her how 
much money she had with her, 
and then told her to give it to him. 
She did, and it was several hun- 
dred dollars. 

He was in business. 

By the end of the next week he 
was rich. He had made himself 
that way by borrowing money 
from everyone he knew — includ- 
ing slight acquaintances who were 
fairly high in the hierarchy of the 
underworld and therefore quite 
solvent — and then telling them 
to forget it. He moved from his 
fleabag pad to a penthouse apart- 
ment atop the swankiest hotel in 
town. It was a bachelor apartment, 
but he slept there alone only sel- 
dom, and then only for purposes 
of recuperation. 

TT was a nice life. Even so it 
took a few weeks of it to make 
Snell realize that he was wasting 
the Power. Why shouldn’t he real- 
ly use what he had? Why not take 
things over — the country first and 
then the world — make himself 
the most powerful dictator in his- 
tory? Why shouldn’t he have and 
own everything, including a harem 
instead of a dame a night? Why 
shouldn’t he have an army to en- 
force the fact that his slightest 
wish would be everyone else’s 
highest law? If his commands were 
obeyed over the telephone, cer- 
tainly they would be obeyed if he 
used radio and television.

I I the biggest one ever swung, and

; mistake. 

He decided to spend a few 
! days alone, out of town and away 
from everybody. He had planning 
to do. 

i He chartered a plane to take 
‘ him to a relatively uncrowded part 
of the Catskills, and from an inn 
(which he took over simply by 
telling the other guests to leave) 
he started taking long walks alone, 
thinking and dreaming. He found 

' 



a favorite spot It was a small hill 
in a valley surrounded by moun- 
tains. The scenery was magnifi- 
cent He did most of his thinking 
there, and found himself becom- 
ing more and more elated and 
euphoric as he began to see that 
it could and would work. 

Dictator, hell! He’d have him- 
self crowned Emperor. Emperor 
of the World! Why not? Who 
could defy a man with the Power? 
The Power to make anyone obey 
any command that he gave them, 
up to and including— 

“Drop dead!” he shouted from 
the hilltop, in sheer vicious exu- 
berance, not caring whether or not 
anyone or anything was within 
range of his voice . 

A teenage boy and a teenage 
girl found him there the next day. 

They hurried back to report the 
dead man they had found on the 
top of Echo Hill.

ACROSS THE SEA OF STARS 
by Arthur C. Clarke. Harcourt, 
Brace & Co., Inc., N. Y., $3.95 

WHEN CLARKE’S collection, 
The Other Side of the Sky, ap- 
peared, I remarked that practi- 
cally all of the Clarke shorts worth 
reprinting in an all-Clarke anthol- 
ogy have been so honored. I never 
reckoned that Harcourt, Brace 
would issue an omnibus Clarke 
and knock my pat statement for a 
loop. 

All the stories are from previous 
volumes — eight from Expedition 
to Earth, five from Tales from the 



White Hart and five from Reach 
for Tomorrow, along with two ex- 
cellent novels. Childhood’s End 
and Earthlight. 

As is usual with most Clarke 
short stories, the last sentence car- 
ries the stiJnner that virtually cer- 
tifies a ten minute digestive pause 
between yarns. Prime examples of 
this shock treatment are “Inherit- 
ance,” “Encounter at Dawn,” 
and “The Fires Within.” 

So, although an anthology 
culled exclusively from previous 
anthologies perhaps should not be 
given a separate rating, this bar- 
gain giant merits : *****

THE DUPLICATED MAN by 
’ James Blish and Robert Lowndes. 
Avalon Books, N. Y., $2.95 

1 “I’LL BE looked upon as the ulti- 
, mate in military plagues,” says the 
f man who is to be duplicated five- 
* fold, “the latest achievement in 
biological weapons.” 

Later, a key character says, “Is 
there a real hero? I can find none 
— or too many.” Actually, the mul- 
tiplicity of prime movers is the aim 
of the authors. 

Venus, colonized by self-exiled 
revolutionaries and hiding behind 
a screen that deflects atomic mis- 
siles, has been pasting Earth hap- 
hazardly with chemical warheads 
for two generations. Earth, at im- 
' easy peace under Security Council 
rule, is too civilized to take puni- 
tive measures against the aggres- 
sors. Hence the intricate plot of in- 
filtration involving the Duplicated 
Man. 

Deviousness of plotting and 
many thumbnail character 
sketches enliven the book.

authorities on diving with closed- 
circuit oxygen apparatus. The big 
advantage of this technique is the 
freedom from the exhalation bub- 
bles of compressed-air gear that 
complicate observation. But, re- 
gardless of breathing methods, 
Hass’s book is a breathtaking ac- 
count of several expeditions into 
exotic waters. 

His text and photographs of his 
encounter with a gigantic whale 
shark in the Red Sea almost defy 
belief, as do the equally startling 
undersea photos obtained of the 
harpooning of a monstrous sperm 
whale in the Azores. 

The Great Barrier Reef of Aus- 
tralia and Darwin’s famed Gala- 
pagos Islands also contribute to 
word and picture. 

WHEN THE SLEEPER 
WAKES by H. G. Wells. Ace 
Books, N. Y., 35^ 

ONE OF the greatest of the true 
SF classics, this book has been out 
of print for so long that it is either 
a nostalgic memory to the older 
reader or a bare legend to the 
younger. In my case, thirty years 
between readings left little recall- 
able detail. 

Sleeper is a prime example of 
the short life of the gadget story. 
Wells’ energy to sustain his com- 
plex culture comes from batteries 
of huge wind vanes. His airplanes 
are flimsy powered gliders, his 



143 



autos ridiculous toys. His guesses 
at science to come were so out- 
stripped by reality that today, half 
a century later, they seem impos- 
sibly timid. 

The worth of his story lies in its 
human values. The social prob- 
lems of the far-from-Brave New 
World, though based on the black- 
and white concepts of 19th cen- 
tury Victorianism, make the story 
the classic that it still is. This is 
“Young Wells” at his non-Utopian 
best. 

MAN’S JOURNEY THROUGH 
TIME by L. S. Palmer. Philo- 
sophical Library, N. Y . 

THE DATE of the beginning of 
man’s inhumanity to man is being 
constantly pushed further back 
into antiquity. In explanation: 
some of the richest finds of human 
remains have been the gruesome 
relics of antediluvian cannibal 
brain feasts. 

Palmer’s book is not meant for 
light reading. His purpose is to 
chart statistically against the back- 
drop of time the subtle changes, 
physical and cultural, that gradu- 
ally led to the first true Homo 
sapiens. Unfortunately, the evolu- 
tionary chart is still full of blank 
spaces. However, as a resume of 
current knowledge, the catchily 
titled volume is exceptional and 
possibly unique. 

A question arises: How far 



along are we, if we still resort to 
cracking our neighbor’s skull to 
win an argument? 

SCIENCE FICTION SHOW- 
CASE, edited by Mary Kornbluth. 
Doubleday & Co., Inc., N. Y., $3.95 

A SAD fact it is, as Frederik Pohl 
states in his introduction, that this 
is one of the very few SF antholo- 
gies that does not contain a yam 
by the late C. M. Kornbluth. But 
this volume, compiled by his 
widow and written by his friends, 
is a sort of memorial. 

The roster, fittingly, is strictly 
big league: Knight, Pohl, Stur- 
geon, Davidson, Anderson, Brad- 
bury, Dick, Blish, Williamson, 
Leinster, Matheson and Bloch. 

“The Long Remembering” by 
Anderson and “Mantage” by 
Matheson, Pohl’s “Man Who Ate 
the World” and Knight’s “Ticket 
to Anywhere” are genuine memory 
grabbers.

THE EXPLORATION OF 
SPACE by Arthur C. Clarke. Har- 
per & Brothers, N. Y., $4.50 

CLARKE’S AUTHORITATIVE 
1951 volume is revised to include 
the very latest information. 

Concerning “Luniks,” the diffi- 
culty of orbiting around the Moon 
is explained: “It is impossible for 
the Moon to trap a rocket. It must 
either crash, or head on out into 
space. Only if the vehicle is slowed 
by the use of braking rockets can 
it remain captive.” 

The ion drive is explained and 
a new one, the plasma jet, is out- 
lined. A plasma is a superheated 
gas such as might derive directly 
from fusion reactions. It could be 
the means of harnessing the hy- 
drogen atom.

seems aware of the lack of narra-

not enough. 

His “New School” is hardly that. 
Rather, it resembles the Good Life

THE TROUBLEMAKERS 



What did Genetics and Hansen's Folly have 
in common? Why, everything . Genetics 
was statistical and Hansen's Folly impossible! 

Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS

GALAXY 




I 

T he living room reflected 
wealth, position, good taste. 
In size it was a full ten feet 
by fourteen, with nearly an eight- 
foot ceiling. Light was furnished by 
glow panels precisely balanced in 
color to produce light’s most flatter- 
ing tint for the woman who sat in 
a delicate chair of authentic, golden- 
veined blackwood. 

The chair itself must have cost 
a fortune to ship from Tau Ceti 
Five. It was an ostentation in the 
eyes of the visitor, who viewed it as 
evidence of a self-indulgent atti- 
tude that would certainly make his 
job more difficult. 

The air in the room was fresh 
and very faintly aromatic, pleasing. 
It came draftlessly refreshed at a 
temperature of seventy-six degrees 
and a relative humidity of fifty per 
cent and pfermitted the entry of no 
more than one foreign particle 
(dust) per cubic foot. 

The coffee table was another os- 
tentation, but for a different reason 
than the imported chair of black- 
wood. The coffee table was of ma- 
hogany — terrestrial mahogany — 
and therefore either antique, heir- 
loom, or both, and in any combina- 
tion of cases it was priceless. It gave 
the visitor some dark pleasure to 
sit before it with his comparison 
microscope parked on the polished 
mahogany surface, with the ease of 
one who always parked his tools on

tables and stands made of treasure 
woods. 

There were four persons. Paul 
Hanford swirled brandy in a snifter 
with a series of nervous gestures. 
Mrs. Hanford sat in the blackwood 
chair unhappily, despite the flatter- 
ing glow of the wall-panels. Their 
daughter, Gloria, sat in such a way 
as to distract the visitor by present- 
ing a target that his eyes could not 
avoid. Try as he would, his gaze 
kept straying to the slender, ex- 
posed bare ankle and the delicate, 
high-arched foot visible beneath 
the hem of the girl’s dress. 

TV ORMAN Ross, GSch, was the 

' visitor, and he subvocalized his 
tenth self-indictment as he tore his 
gaze away from Gloria Hanford’s 
ankle to look into Paul Hanford’s 
face. Ross was the Scholar of Ge- 
netics for the local division of the 
Department of Domestic Tranquil- 
ity and he should have known all 
about such things, but he obviously 
did not. 

He said, “You can hardly blame 
yourselves, you know,” although he 
did not really believe it. 

“But what have we done wrong?” 
asked Mrs. Hanford in a plaintive 
voice. 

Scholar Ross shook his head and 
caught his gaze in mid-stray before 
it returned all the way to that al- 
luring ankle. “Genetics, my dear 
Mrs. Hanford, is a statistical sci- 
ence, not a precise science.” He 



waved vaguely at the comparison 
microscope. “There are your back- 
grounds for seven generations. No 
one — and I repeat, no one — could 
have foreseen the issue of a head- 
strong, difficult offspring from the 
mating of characteristics such as 
these. I checked most carefully, 
most minutely, just to be certain 
that some obscure but important 
conflict had not been overlooked by 
the signing doctor. Doctors, how- 
ever, do make mistakes.” 

Gloria Hanford dandled her calf 
provocatively and caused the hem 
of her skirt to rise another half- 
inch. The scholar’s eyes swung, 
clung, and were jerked away again. 

“What’s wrong with me. Scholar 
Ross?” she asked in a throaty voice. 

“You are headstrong, self-willed, 
wild, and — ” his voice failed be- 
cause he wanted to lash out at her 
for her brazen and deliberate dis- 
play of her bare ankle; he strug- 
gled to find a drawing-room word 
for her that would not wholly of- 
fend the hapless parents and ul- 
timately came up with — “meretri- 
cious.” 

Gloria said, “I’m all that just be- 
cause I enjoy a little fun?” 

“You may call it fun to scare 
people to death by flying your air- 
car below roof level along the city 
streets, but the Department of Air 
Traffic says that it is both danger- 
ous and illegal.” 

“Pooh!” 

Paul Hanford said, “Gloria, it 



150 



GALAXY 



isn’t that you don’t know better.” 
Mrs. Hanford said, “Paul, how 
have we failed as parents?” 

Scholar Ross shook his head. 
“You haven’t failed. You can’t help 
it if your daughter is a throw- 
back — ” 

“Throwback!” exclaimed Gloria. 
“ — to an earlier, more violent 
age when uncontrolled groups of 
headstrong youths formed gangs of 
New York and conducted open 
warfare upon one another for the 
control of Tammany Hall. Those 
wild days were the result of un- 
registered, unrestricted, and un- 
controlled matings. Since no at- 
tempt was made to prevent the 
unfit from mating with the unfit, 
there were many generations of 
wild ones — troublemakers. It is not 
surprising that, with such a human 
heritage, an occasional wild one is 
born today.” 

^ I ' HE scholar took another sur- 
reptitious (he hoped) glance at 
the bare ankle and said, “No, you 
are not directly to blame. We know 
you wouldn’t spawn a trouble- 
maker willfully and maliciously. 
It’s just an unfortunate accident. 
You must not despair over the past 
— but you must spend your efforts 
to calm the troubled future.” 

“What should we do. Scholar 
Ross?” asked Paul Hanford. 

“I have to speak bluntly. Per- 
haps you’d prefer the ladies to 
leave.” 

THE TROUBLEMAKERS 



“I’ll not go,” said Mrs. Hanford 
firmly, and Gloria added, “I’m not 
going to let you talk about me be- 
hind my back!” 

“Very well. As Scholar of Ge- 
netics, I am head of the local Divi- 
sion of Domestic Tranquility. I 
would prefer to keep my district 
calm and peaceful, without the at- 
tention of the punitive authorities, 
and I’m sure you’d all prefer this, 
too.” 

“Absolutely!” said Paul Han- 
ford. 

“Now, then,” said Scholar Ross, 
“for the immediate problem, we’ll 
prescribe fifty milligrams of doci- 
line, one tablet to be taken each 
night before retiring. This will 
place our young lady’s frame of 
mind in a receptive mood to sug- 
gestions of gentler pursuits. As soon 
as possible, Mr. Hanford, subscribe 
to Music To Live By and have 
them pipe in Program G-252 every 
evening, starting shortly affer din- 
nertime and signing off shortly after 
breakfast. Your daughter’s dinner- 
time and breakfast I mean, and the 
outlet should be in her bedroom. It 
is not mandatory that she heed the 
program material all the time, but 
it must be available to set her 
moods. Finally, upon awakening, 
a twenty-five milligram tablet of 
nitrolabe will lower the patient’s 
capacity for anticipating excite- 
ment during the day.” 

He paused for a moment thought- 
fully, and added as if it were an 

151 



aside, ‘Td not go so far as to sug- 
gest ftat you — her parents — make 
a conscious effort to avoid listening 
to periods of Program G-252, but 
I’d definitely warn you not to fall 
into the habit of listening to it.” 

He eyed the ceiling thoughtfully, 
then consulted his notebook. “Come 
to think of it. I’ll also give you a 
prescription for Program X-870 
which you can use or not as you 
desire. Have this one piped into 
your bedroom, Mrs. Hanford, and 
try to strike a somewhat reasonable 
balance. Say no greater imbalance 
than about two of one to one of the 
other and if you, Mr. Hanford, 
spend any time listening to your 
daughter’s program material, you 
should also counteract its effect by 
listening to an equal time of the 
program prescribed for Mrs. Han- 
ford.” 

He turned back to Gloria and 
shook his head. 

She smiled archly at him and 
asked, “Now what’s wrong?” 

“You,” he told her bluntly. “If 
this delinquency weren’t a mental 
disorder, I’d prescribe a ten milli- 
gram dose of micrograine to be 
taken at the first quickening of the 
pulse prior to excitement. I don’t 
suppose you really regret your 
wildness, though, do you, Miss 
Hanford?” 

S HE shook her head. “No, and I 
don’t really enjoy the whole 
program you’ve laid out for me.” 
152 



“I’d hardly expect anybody to 
approve of a program that is cal- 
culated to change their entire per- 
sonality and character,” said 
Scholar Ross. “But a bit of common 
logic will convince you that it is the 
better thing. Miss Hanford, you’ve 
simply got to conform.” 

“Why?” she demanded. 

‘We live in a free world. Miss 
Hanford, but it is a freedom diluted 
by our responsibility to our fellow- 
man. The density of population 
here on Earth is too high to permit 
rowdy behavior. Laws are not 
passed simply to curtail a man’s 
freedom. They are passed to pro- 
tect the innocent bystander — who 
is minding his own business — from 
the unruly, headstrong character 
who doesn’t see anything wrong in 
disposing of empty beer bottles by 
dropping them out of his apartment 
window, and justifying his behavior 
by pointing out that it is a hundred- 
yard walk down the corridor to the 
trash chute. When we live so close 
together that no one can raise his 
voice in anger without disturbing 
his neighbor, then we have the right 
to pass laws against such a display 
of temp>er. It works both ways. 
Miss Hanford. By requiring people 
to behave themselves, we ultimate- 
ly arrive at a social culture in which 
no one conducts himself in such a 
way as to anger his neighbor into 
violence. Have I made myself 
clear?” 

“In other words,” said Gloria, “if 
GALAXY 



II 



it’s fim, hurry up and pass a law 
against it!” 

“Well, hardly that—” the scholar 
began. 

“Tell me,” she interrupted. “How 
long am I going to be on this pill- 
and-lullaby diet?” 

“It may be for a long time. In 
severe cases, it is for the rest of the 
patient’s life. On the other hand, 
we have quite a bit of evidence that 
your urge to excitement may 
dwindle with maturity. Oh, we do 
not propose to make a pariah out 
of you. Marriage and motherhood 
have settling effects, too.” 

“My baby—!” cried Mrs. Han- 
ford. 

“Your baby,” commented Paul 
Hanford in a very dry voice, “is a 
college graduate, twenty years 
old.” 

“Nobody’s asked my opinion,” 
complained Gloria, swinging her 
leg and hiking the hem of her skirt 
another half-inch above the slender 
ankle. 

“Nobody will. However, Miss 
Hanford, I shall place your card in 
the ‘eligible’ file and have your 
characteristics checked. I’m sure 
that we can find a man who will be 
acceptable to you — and also to the 
department of Domestic Tran- 
quility.” 

“Humph!” 

“Sneer if you will. Miss Hanford. 
But marriage and motherhood 
have taken the ‘hell’ out of a lot 
of hell-raisers in the past” 

THE TROUBLEMAKERS 



J UNIOR Spaceman Howard 
Reed entered the comman- 
dant’s office eagerly and briddy. 
His salute was snappy as he an- 
nounced himself. 

Commander Breckenridge 
looked up at the young spaceman 
without expression, nodded curtly, 
and then looked down at the pile 
of papers neatly stacked in the cen- 
ter of his desk. Without saying a 
word, the commander fingered 
down through the pile imtil he 
came to a thin sheaf of papers 
stapled together. This file he with- 
drew, placed atop the stack, and 
then he proceeded to read every 
word of every page as if he were 
refreshing his memory about some 
minor incident that had become 
important only because of the up- 
per-level annoyance it had caused. 

When he finished, he looked up 
and said coldly, “I presume you 
know why you’re here, Mr. Reed?” 
“I can guess, sir — because of my 
technical suggestion.” 

“You are correct.” 

“And it’s been accepted?” cried 
the junior spaceman eagerly. 

“It has not!” snapped the su- 
perior officer. “In fact—” 

“But, sir, I don’t understand—” 
“Silence!” said Commander 
Breckenridge. Almost automatical- 
ly, his right hand slipped the top 
drawer open to expose the vial of 
tri-colored capsules. His hand 

153 



stopped short of them, dangling 
into the drawer from the wrist rest- 
ing on the edge. He looked down at 
the pills and seemed to be debating 
whether it would be better to con- 
duct this painful interview as gen- 
tlemen should, or to let his ri^t- 
eous anger show. 

“Mr. Reed,” he said heavily, 
“your aptitudes and qualifications 
were reviewed most carefully by 
the Bureau of Personnel, and then- 
considered judgment caused your 
replacement here, in the Bureau of 
Operations. You were not— and I 
repeat, not— placed in the Bureau 
of Research. Is this clear?” 

“Yes, sir. But-” 

“Mr. Reed, I cannot object to 
the provisions in the Regulations 
whereby encoiu-agement is given 
both the officers and men to prof- 
fer suggestions for the betterment 
of the Service. However, a shoe- 
maker should stick to his last. The 
benefit of this program becomes a 
detriment when any officer or man 
tries to invade other departments. 
This works both ways, Mr. Reed. 
There is not an officer in the whole 
Bureau of Research who can tell 
me a single thing about organi2ing 
my Bureau of Operations. Con- 
versely, I would be completely 
stimned if any Operations officer 
were to come up with something 
that hasn’t been known to the 
Bureau of Research for years.” 

“Y es, sir. I see your point, sir. But 
if the Bureau of Research has 



known about my suggestion for 
years, why isn’t it being used?” 
“Because, Mr. Reed, it will not 
work!” 

“But, sir, it’s gpt to work!” 

“And you feel so firmly con- 
vinced of this that you had the 
temerity to bypass my office?” 

“Sir, you yourself make a point 
of professing to know absolutely 
nothing about scientific matters.” 
“All right, we’ll table this angle 
for a few minutes. Just what makes 
this notion of yours so important, 
Mr. Reed?” 

said Reed, “the maxi- 
^ mum range for our most effi- 
cient spacecraft is only a bit over 
seventeen light-years to the point of 
no return. My suggestion deals 
with a means of extending that 
range a hundred times. Perhaps 
more. If it were my decision, sir, 
an3Tthing that even hinted at ex- 
tending the cruising range would 
receive a maximum-urgency pri- 
ority.” 

“In other words, you feel that 
anything we can do to extend our 
operations is the most important 
thing in the whole Space Service?” 
“Well, sir, perhaps not the most 
important, but — ” 

“Your modesty is gratifying. I 
presume this modesty would pre- 
vent you from accepting any more 
than the Letter of Commendation 
from the Office of the Secretary?” 
“I don’t rmderstand, sir.” 

GALAXY 



154 



“You don’t? Mr. Reed, was your 
desire to improve the efficiency of 
Operations a simple desire to im- 
prove the Service — or did you 
hope that this brilliant suggestion 
would, perhaps, provide you with 
a better assignment?” 

“I still do not understand.” 

“Oh, you don’t? Mr. Reed, why 
did you join the Space Service in 
the first place?” 

“Because, sir, I hoped that I 
could be instrumental in helping 
mankind to spread across the 
Galaxy.” 

“Mr. Reed, have you sand in 
your shoes?” 

“Sir?” 

The commander sighed. “You 
hoped to go along on the voyage, 
didn’t you?” 

‘Well, sir, I did have a hope that 
I’d become a real spaceman.” 
“And you’re disappointed?” 
Howard Reed’s face was wistful, 
torn between a desire to confide in 
his commanding officer and the 
fear of saying what he knew to be a 
sharp criticism of the Space Serv- 
ice. 

Then Reed realized that he was 
in a bad pinch anywa^and so he 
said, “Sir, I’m commissioned as a 
junior spaceman, but in three years 
Fve only made one short test flight 
— and only to Luna! I am compe- 
tent to pilot — or at least that’s 
what the flight simulators say in 
my checkout tests. Fm a jimior 
spaceman — yet every time I apply 
for active space duty, Fm refused!

ice, sir, solving theoretical and hy- 
pothetical problems in space opera- 
tions. But aside frohi one test flight 
to the Moon, I haVe yet to set a 
foot inside of a spacecraft, let alone 
stand on the soil of another world!” 
“You must learn patience, Mr. 
Reed.” 

“Patience, sk? Look, sk, I took 
this sedentary duty Until I’d had it 
up to here, and then I began to pry 
into the question of why we have a 
Space Force, complete with space- 
craft, and still do so little space 
traveling. I found out. We’re lim- 
ited to a maximum tange of seven- 
teen light-years to the point of no 
return. Even a trip to Eden, Tau 
Ceti, our nearest colony, is eleven- 
point-eight light-years, and that 
takes prodigious power.” 

“Granted,” said the commander. 
“But now, sk, if we could in- 
crease our range by one hundred 
times, this does not necessarily 
mean that we must actually power 
the spacecraft for that point of no 
return. It also means that we could 
charge the ship with one one-him- 
dredth of its former banks for the 
short trip to Eden, Tau Ceti — 
which would leave a fantastic 
amount of storage and cargo and 
passenger space. Sir, we could start 
real commerce!” 

OMMANDER Breckenridge 
^ gave no reaction. 

“And you hoped to be among 
them.”

“Yes, sir! As a kid, I read about 
mankind’s first exploration of space 
two hundred years ago, sir. Of 
course, I couldn’t hope to set foot 
on a new planet, since every possi- 
ble planet within the seventeen- 
light-year range has been looked 
over. But I wanted to see space 
myself, sir — and I did hope that I 
might extend Man’s frontier be- 
yond our rather small limit” 

“Yes, I can understand the im- 
patience of youth,” said Comman- 
der Breckenridge. “For that, I can 
forgive you. But for trying to do the 
other man’s job, I cannot.” 

“Sir, you’re as much as saying 
that no one can have a good techni- 
cal idea but the technical people 
at the Bureau of Research.” 

In answer, the commander 
flipped over several pages of the 
file. He said: “Mister Reed, this is 
what resulted in your abortive at- 
tempt to gain a scientific ear in- 
stead of forwarding your suggestion 
through the standard channels. I’m 
going to quote some pertinent parts 
of a letter from Commander Briggs, 
head of the Bureau of Research. 
Listen: 

“ — young genius has rediscov- 
ered the line of mathematical argu- 
ment known here at Research as 
‘Hansen’s Folly’ because it was first 
exploited by young Spaceman Han- 
sen about a hundred and fifty years 
ago. Hansen’s Folly is probably to 
be expected of a young, ambitious 
young officer with stars in his eyes. 
I’d be inclined to congratulate him 

156 



— if it weren’t for the fact that 
Hansen’s Folly turns up with such 
regularity that we here at Research 
hold a regular pool against its next 
rediscovery. You’ll be happy to 
know that you, your yoimg genius, 
and your department have ‘won’ for 
me the great honor (?) of buying 
dinner for the crew at the Officers 
Club on Saturday next. 

“Don’t be too hard on yoimg 
Reed; the rediscovery of Hansen’s 
Folly takes a rather bright mind. 
However, Breck, I will congratu- 
late your bright yoimg man if he 
can — without any further clue — 
go back over his own mathematics 
and locate the flaw. I’ll — ” 

“There’s more of this, but it isn’t 
germane,” said Breckenridge quiet- 
ly. “This is enough.” 

“Enough, sir?” repeated Reed 
blankly. 

“Enough to let you know what 
goes on. Now, Mr. Reed, you’ve 
committed nothing but a brash act 
of bad taste in bypassing the stan- 
dard channels. Such an indiscretion 
demands some form of punishment, 
but if I were to attempt to outline 
punishment officially, it would be 
unfortunately easy for some legal 
eagle to point out that your be- 
havior was, to the best of your 
knowledge, intended for the better- 
ment of the Service. And further- 
more that I was wreaking ven- 
geance upon your hapless soul for 
having made my name the brunt 
of jokes at the Officers Club.” 

“I’m sorry, sir.” 



GALAXY 



“Being sorry is not enough, Mr. 
Reed. But I have a plan that will 
gratify everybody concerned. You 
want to become an active space- 
man? Very well, your next tour of 
duty will be at the Space Force 
Station on the planet Eden, Tau 
Ceti. It will terminate when you 
have finally succeeded in locating 
the flaw in Hansen’s Folly and can 
show the error to the satisfaction 
of Commander Briggs. Have I 
made myself clear, Mr. Reed?” 

“Yes, sir, and thank you, sir. 
You’re really doing me a favor, 
sir.” 

“Mr. Reed, despite the age-old 
platitude, it is wise to look the gift 
horse in the mouth, at least before 
saying thanks.” 

Ill 

C CHOLAR Norman Ross smiled 
^ at his host’s statement. “Yes, 
indeed, Mr. Harrison! Arranging 
these things so that we can main- 
tain the Norm is often a delicate 
and arduous task. There are restric- 
tions, and there are many variables 
involved, the most sensitive of 
which are the feelings of the people 
involved.” 

“Your job must call for the ul- 
timate in diplomacy,” said Mrs. 
Harrison. 

To his host’s wife. Scholar Ross 
nodded. “Yet,” he said as an after- 
thought, “of even greater value is a 
high regard for the perfect truth. 



This includes the self-discipline of 
admitting it when one has been 
wrong, and being able to state pre- 
cisely how, where, why, and, most 
important, to what degree.” 

“I don’t understand,” said his 
hostess. 

“Mrs. Harrison, let’s consider 
Bertram.” 

She cast a glance at her son. In 
an earlier age, he would have been 
called “indolent.” During dinner, 
Bertram had employed the correct 
fork, plied his knife properly, con- 
versed with his partners on both 
sides — yet she knew something 
was wrong. 

“Bertram,” she said, “haven’t you 
been forgetting your pills?” 

“Sorry, Mother,” replied the 
young man tunelessly. 

Bertram arose and left, and 
Scholar Ross said, ‘This is what I 
mean, Mrs. Harrison. Genetics is 
not a precise science; it is statisti- 
cal. We can consider highly favor- 
able the mating of two well-bal- 
anced people, and we can predict 
that this union will produce well- 
balanced children. Unfortunately 
we cannot guarantee the desired re- 
sults. Hence we have anomalies 
such as Bertram, whose problem is 
simply a lack of drive. Now this is 
no fault of yours, Mrs. Harrison, 
nor of yours, Mr. Harrison. It may 
be the fault of Genetics, but if it is 
our ‘fault,’ then the fault lies in the 
lack of total knowledge; but not in 
the misuse, or lack of use, of what 



THE TROUBLEMAKERS 



157 



knowledge we do already have.” 
“I see what you mean, Scholar 
Ross.” 

“You’ll also see the opposite 
when the Hanfords arrive. Here we 
have parents as stable as you two. 
You’ll pardon me if I say that if all 
four of your characteristic cards 
were dropped at once and I had 
been expected to render a consid- 
ered opinion as to their most favor- 
able mating combination, I could 
render no preference, so equal are 
you. However, your union has pro- 
duced Bertram. Conversely, their 
mating has produced a girl who is 
wild, headstrong, willful.” 

13 ERTRAM returned, seated 
himself quietly, and when 
Scholar Ross stopped talking, Ber- 
tram said apologetically, “I took a 
double dose. Mother.” 

“Is that all right?” she asked 
Scholar Ross. 

“Probably won’t do any harm,” 
he said. 

Mr. Harrison cleared his throat. 
“I’m not sure that I approve of Ber- 
tram marrying a headstrong girl. 
Scholar Ross.” 

Mrs. Harrison said, “William, 
you know it’s best.” 

“For Bertram?” 

“Now here,” said Scholar Ross, 
‘Sve must cease considering the wel- 
fare of the individual alone and 
start thinking of him as a part of an 
integrated society. No man is an 
island, Mr. Harrison. In a less ad- 



vanced culture, Bertram would 
have been permitted to meet con- 
temporary personalities. Perhaps 
might have met someone who — as 
he does — lacks drive and initiative, 
and the result would have been a 
family of dull children. Had he 
been imlucky enough to marry a 
woman with drive and ambition, 
their children might have been nor- 
mal, but the entire home life would 
have been an emotional battlefield. 
And that — ” 

“Isn’t that what you’re about to 
achieve?” asked Mr. Harrison. 

“Not at all. We shall achieve the 
normal, happy children who will 
undoubtedly grow into fine, stable 
adults. To gain this end, of course, 
their home life must be happy and 
tranquil. We’ll prescribe for them — 
allowing for the emotional change 
that results from marriage and — ” 

The doorbell interrupted the 
scholar’s explanation. “Allow me,” 
he said, rising and heading for the 
apartment door. The Harrisons fol- 
lowed him at a slight distance. It 
was the Hanfords. 

There was the full roimd robin of 
introductions and small talk; “You 
had no trouble?” “No, the intercity 
beacon was running clear — ” “Love- 
ly apartment, Mrs. Harrison.” “Mrs. 
Hanford, here in Philadelphia we 
feel that we’re almost in the sub- 
urbs.” “Got a treat for you, Hanford 
— been saving a bottle of natural 
bourbon!” “That’ll be a treat, all 
right!” “This is a real event. Scholar

Ross.” “You know, Mrs. Hanford, 
the vidphone hardly does you jus- 
tice!” “Why, thank you!” 

“Miss Hanford, may I present 
Bertram Harrison?” “How do you 
do?” “I do as I please. What’s your 
excuse?” “Huh?” "Now, Gloria!” 
“Bertram, show Gloria the flower 
room. Go on, now!” 

Scholar Ross watched the young 
couple walk through a French door 
to an outside terrace. He turned to 
Harrison and said, “Everything 
set?” 

Harrison nodded. “Had a little 
trouble with the Music people till 
I used your priority. They said 
they’d have Program R-147 piped 
into the flower room. Frankly, I 
think R-2 15 is better.” 

C CHOLAR Ross laughed gently. 
^ “Probably happy association.” 
‘Wife and I still have it piped in 
for our anniversary,” Mr. Harrison 
admitted. 

“Good for you! But R-2 15 is for 
normal, happily well-balanced 
young people who’d probably fall 
in love without it. R-147 is sure-fire 
for emotional opposites.” 

“Well, we finally got the program 
piped in, so what do we do now?” 
Scholar Ross smiled quietly. “We 
wait. We get acquainted, because 
there is a very high probability that 
you two families will be united 
through the marriage of your chil- 
dren. Then I shall enter a new file 
in the Genetics Bureau of the De- 



partment of Domestic Tranquility. 
We shall watch through the years 
as your grandchildren grow, and 
make periodic checks, and thereby 
advance mankind’s knowledge of 
genetics.” 

‘Doesn’t this sort of master- 
minding ever give you a God com- 
plex?” asked Mr. Hanford. 

“Not at all. Were I God, I’m sure 
I could arrange things a lot better.” 

“In what way?” 

“By Man’s own laws, we are 
prevented from doing active gen- 
etic research on the human race. We 
apply what happens to mice and 
fruit flies to the human family tree. 
We’ve known for centuries how to 
breed blue-eyed or brown-eyed peo- 
ple, or, if we wanted, we could make 
the race predominantly fat or thin, 
tall or short. However, our main 
aim is not the ultimate purity of 
any physical characteristic. Orir 
goal is to produce a stable, happy 
people by eliminating the lethargic 
personality below and the excitable 
types above.” 

The scholar thought for a mo- 
ment, and then, remembering Ber- 
tram’s error in forgetting to take his 
go-pills, said, “But we are blocked 
by law. I can prescribe medication 
and therapy, but I have no power to 
force the patient to take the treat- 
ment. This is a most difficult prob- 
lem, believe me.” 

“In what way?” asked Mrs. Har- 
rison with some interest. 

“The lethargic types are very 



THE TROUBLEMAKERS 



159 



apt to forget, or to dismiss the med- 
ication or the therapy as too much 
trouble. The overactive type is 
more likely to be water skiing on 
Lake Superior than sitting and lis- 
tening to the tranquilizing strains of 
prescribed music, and the medica- 
tion dumped down the drain in- 
stead of taken.” 

“You do have your problems, 
don’t you?” said Mrs. Hanford sym- 
pathetically. 

“Ah, yes. But our greatest prob- 
lem is the overactive young female. 
Young males can be siphoned off in 
one way or another — work to be 
done that, unfortunately, females, 
can’t also do.” Scholar Ross smiled 
at Mr. and Mrs. Harrison. “So we 
actually are grateful for the lethar- 
gic types. They provide us with a 
fine sobering influence upon the — ” 

The scholar was interrupted by a 
wordless cry from beyond the 
French windows. 

' I ^HE Harrisons, the Hanfords, 
and Scholar Ross leaped to 
their feet and started for the ter- 
race. They did not get all the way 
to the French doors, for Gloria 
Hanford came stamping in. Her 
eyes were bright, and she was dust- 
ing one palm with the other. 

“What - ?” 

Gloria snapped, “Someone been 
feeding that oaf red meat?” 

“But what happened?” asked Mr. 
Harrison. 

“Oh, I could stand the big 



dummy acting as if he’d never been 
alone with a girl before in all his life. 
But to ask me for a kiss!” 

“Is that what caused the erup- 
tion?” said Scholar Ross. 

‘When he asked me for a kiss, I 
told him that I was saving my kisses 
for a man!” 

“And then?” 

“Then he decided that I meant a 
man big enough to wrestle.” Gloria 
laughed and then looked thought- 
ful. 

“What’s so funny — and not so 
funny now?” 

“I just realized that I like men!” 

“But Bertram?” 

“Darned if it isn’t the first time 
I’ve ever resented being pawed,” 
said Gloria in a matter-of-fact tone, 
-as if it were her hair-do rather than 
her virtue that was the subject of 
discussion. “So I grabbed a hand, 
hung the arm over my shoulder with 
the inside upward, and hip-tossed 
the big oaf over the railing into that 
silly little fish pond.” 

“Gloria!” exploded her mother. 

“Poor Bertram!” exclaimed his 
mother. 

Scholar Ross sighed. “These 
things often go awry at first. Ber- 
tram shouldn’t have taken a double 
dose of his medication. And I’d 
guess that Gloria hasn’t been metic- 
ulous about hers, either. Now — ” 

He was interrupted by the ar- 
rival of Bertram Harrison, who 
looked as if he’d just waded home 
across a mud flat at low tide. He 



160 



GALAXY 



stepped toward Gloria purpose- 
fully; the girl crouched in a judo 
position and said, ‘Want some 
more? Come and get it!” 

“Now wait a moment,” said 
Scholar Ross. “Gloria, where did 
you ever learn such brutal, belliger- 
ant tactics?” 

^ LORIA faced him, but kept 
one eye on Bertram. “Out of 
a book — where else in this calm old 
world?” 

The scholar said, “You see. Miss 
Hanford, the results of your out- 
rageous behavior? You’ve commit- 
ted an act of physical violence. 
You’ve 

The girl gave one sharp bark of 
laughter. “Who started it with 
whose caveman technique?” 

“I think,” said Scholar Ross to 
the four parents, .“that this meeting 
should be resumed at a later date. 
Bertram must not overdose himself 
in a misguided effort to make up for 
omitted medication. Gloria must 
not avoid hers — and, Mrs. Han- 
ford, you’ll not only have to watch 
closely to see that she does take her 
pills; you’ll also have to make sure 
that Gloria doesn’t counteract them 
by surreptitiously acquiring some 
agitators to neutralize the tranquil- 
izers.” 

“And suppjose I call the whole 
thing off?” demanded Gloria. “Sup)- 
pose I don’t agree to share bed and 
board with this souped-up sardine?” 
The room grew quieter until the 



background soimds were gone and 
from the patio came the faint, sweet 
strains of romantic music: Program 
R-147. 

Finally Scholar Ross said, “Miss 
Hanford, we cannot force you to do 
anything, but we can make your life 
extremely uncomfortable if you do 
not comply with what we believe to 
be best for society. You will find — 
if you care to look it up — that there 
is a drastic shortage of eligible 
young women on the planet Eden, 
Tau CetL” 

“You mean — migrate — to the 
colony?” 

“I mean just that.” 

Gloria Hanford’s face went white. 
She understood that if Scholar Ross 
decreed Eden, Tau Ceti, for her, 
then she would end up on Eden, 
Tau Ceti, and it made no difference 
whether by force, coercion, or gen- 
tle persuasion. 

Mrs. Hanford took a step for- 
ward and opened her mouth to 
speak. But before she could protest, 
her husband put out a hand and 
stoppjed her. His act was an admis- 
sion that not money, position, nor 
logic Would overrule such a deci- 
sion. 

“Ekien, Tau Ceti,” breathed Glo- 
ria. She turned and faced Bertram 
Harrison. “Junior,” she said in a 
dry, strained voice, “if you’ll wear 
mittens and handcuffs, let’s go back 
in the garden and get acquainted.” 

Her father exhaled a full breath. 

Mr. Harrison tapped him on the

shoulder. “How about a sample of 
that bottle of natural bourbon?” he 
suggested. 

“Not,” Mrs. Hanford said shak- 
ily, “without me!” 



IV 

l^T AN’S first sally across the gulf 
of interstellar space had been 
more fruitful than his first fumbling 
exploration of the Solar System by 
a score of one to nothing. Of all the 
celestial real estate that orbits 
around old Sol, only the Earth will 
support life — at least as we know 
it. Survival elsewhere depends 
upon taking enough of Earth en- 
vironment along to last of the trip. 
From the scientific standpoint, the 
first exploration of space was a bril- 
liant operation, but before finding 
a place to accept the teeming mil- 
lions of Earth’s exploding popula- 
tion, the patient nearly died. For 
it was a quarter of a century until 
Murray, Langdon, and Hanover 
cracked the Einstein barrier. 

By careful design, and then by 
counting the last gram and strik- 
ing a mathematically adjusted bal- 
ance between ppwer bank and crew 
space, the range of a spacecraft was 
found to be slightly more than sev- 
enteen light-years to the point of 
no return. 

Within seventeen light-years of 
Sol, there are forty-one other stars. 



Of these forty-one stars, three 
are triple-sim systems, and twelve 
are doubles, which eliminates fif- 
teen of them. Of the remaining 
twenty-six single stars, one is the 
blinding-blue giant Altair, two are 
white dwarf stars, and nineteen of 
them are the faint red dwarf stars 
of Spectral Class M, and that elimi- 
nates all but four of the orig ina l 
forty-one. Of this remaining four. 
Epsilon Eridani, Epsilon Indi, and 
Groombridge 1618 fall into the 
orange Spectral Class K, which is 
not too far away from Sol’s Spec- 
tral Class G. BufK is only close; 
it is no bull’s eye when the combi- 
nation of all the factors must add 
up to produce a planetary environ- 
ment that will support human life. 

And so, having eliminated forty 
out of the forty-one stars in Sol’s 
neighborhood, only Tau Ceti re- 
mains. Tau Ceti is also a Spectral 
Class G star and therefore Tau 
Ceti was voted the star most likely 
to succeed, long before Man had 
the foggiest notion of how to cross 
the light-years, long before instru- 
ments sensitive enough to ascertain 
that Tau Ceti possessed a planetary 
system were developed. 

Tau Ceti’s planetary system can 
be used as an example of the bril- 
liance of logic and reasoning. The 
second planet in the family of Tau 
Ceti is the planet Eden. 

Eden supports life. 

Or perhaps it is more proper to 



162 



GALAXY 




THE TROUBLEMAKERS 



163 




say that Eden’s environment per- 
mits life to support itself. Voltaire, 
through the mouths of his charac- 
ters Candide and Pangloss, had a 
lot to say about Earth being the 
best of all possible worlds, both 
pro and con. He had never been 
to Eden. Eden was christened by 
the rules of real estate that dictate 
that a housing development situ- 
ated on a tree-bald plain in central 
Kansas shall be called “Sylvan 
Heights.” 

V 

J UNIOR Spaceman Howard 
Reed went through a brief 
period of excitement and then set- 
tled down to boredom. The excite- 
ment came from his first experience 
in space travel, and the thrill of 
standing on soil almost twelve 
light-years from home base. This 
thrill faded as soon as he discov- 
ered that the people on Eden, Tau 
Ceti, were far too busy to be both- 
ered with the reactions of a junior 
spaceman. 

If his duties had been demand- 
ing, Reed might have gone on for 
some time without becoming bored. 
But as a junior officer in the Space 
Service, Reed had no roots, no 
property, no basic interests on 
Eden. 

The Space Service had been 
born out of interservice rivalry dur- 
ing a tense period of international 
competition. There had been a 
164 



strong upsurge during the early 
years of the initial interstellar ex- 
ploration. The leaders of the Space 
Service were quite willing to feath- 
erbed themselves into permanent 
positions of high authority. They 
discovered the best method lay in 
exploiting every method of scaring 
the public with the bogey of meet- 
ing some warlike culture “Out 
There.” Then the years passed with 
neither sight nor evidence of any 
other form of life but Man and the 
creatures he carried with him. The 
Space Service found itself with lit- 
tle to do. 

It did not stop the clamor for 
money, men and materiel. But the 
job of the Space Service was not 
hunting space pirates. The only 
place where the power banks of a 
spacecraft could be restored was 
in the hands of the Space Service 
itself, and it was an installation vast 
enough to tax the wealth and in- 
genuity of a whole continent to 
create. The job was not fighting in- 
terstellar wars with fierce, super- 
intelligent interstellar aliens with 
a taste for human flesh — not, at 
least, until human and alien met. 

So, in a desultory manner, the 
Space Service maintained a per- 
imeter of lookout and detection 
stations that could have been com- 
pletely automated ... if it hadn’t 
been that there were more Space 
Service Personnel than the Service 
could find work for. 

The whole situation gave Junior 
GALAXY 



I Spaceman Howard Reed a lot of 
I time to think. 

I The culture of Eden, Tau Ceti, 
I completed the process, 
f Eden used old-fashioned tele- 
j phones because its people were too

keep the voracious maw of an au- 
tomated assembly plant satiated 
with raw material shipped from 
home base. And then, one week’s

Ceti market. They were a people 
who played their own musical in- 
struments because they were faced 
with the very odd economic fact 
that the first phonograph record 
from the die costs five thousand 
dollars. Nobody makes a dime un- 
til fifty thousand of its brothers are 
sold. The population to buy fifty 
thousand did not exist 

In simple fact, Eden, Tau Ceti, 
was far from a flourishing colony. 
It was a classic example of the sim- 
ple economic truth that a fully in- 
tegrated mechanistic society can 
not be supported by a sparsely 
populated region. 

A MBITION has many origins. 

The urge to return home be- 
came a drive. The result was Junior 
Spaceman Howard Reed’s com- 
plete preoccupation with the math- 
ematics known as Hansen’s Folly. 

As the months went by he ex- 
hausted his original knowledge. He 
took to the library, to the local 
schools, and to self-study to im- 
prove his grasp. He approached the 
basic mathematics of the space 
drive from several different angles, 
even going back to the old original 
Einstein Equations and learning 
their fault in the hope that this 
study might point the way. 

Then, as the months began to 
grow into the close of his first year, 
Reed took advantage of the casual- 
ly informal operation at the Space 
Service Base. He began to experi- 

165 



ment with hardware on the theory 
that he would have a better grasp 
of the problem if he tried some 
empirical work as well as the aca- 
demic approach. 

Junior Spaceman Howard Reed 
had been on Eden, Tau Ceti, for 
eighteen terrestrial months before 
his superior officer, making a tour 
of inspection, opened the office re- 
served for him at the Administra- 
tion Building. On the eighth day of 
his visit, Commander Breckenridge 
summoned the junior spaceman to 
his office. He asked, “Mr. Reed, 
have you been successful in solv- 
ing the flaw in Hansen’s Folly?” 
“Well, sir, not exactly.” 

“Have you improved your grasp 
of the facts of life?” 

“Sir? I don’t quite understand.” 
“You don’t? Well, perhaps you 
need some help. For instance, Mr. 
Reed, can you give me an estimate 
of the useful land area of Eden, Tau 
Ceti?” 

“Sir, the total land area is about 
fifty million square miles. Perhaps 
about half of that is useful, or could 
be.” 

“Ah. You said ‘could be’. Why, 
Mr. Reed?” 

“Let’s put it this way, sir. 
Whether a given acreage is useful 
often depends upon how badly it is 
needed. For instance, a plot of 
wooded land might well be ignored 
for centuries by a sparsely popu- 
lated agrarian culture who had a 
lot of open plain to cultivate. At a 
166 



later date, an increasing pressure 
of population might make it ex- 
pedient and sensible to clear vast 
areas of tree strimps, boulders and 
all sorts of hazards.” 

“And here on Eden?” 

‘Well, sir, at the present time 
the population of Eden is about a 
hundred thousand. Fertile plains 
are growing wild with weeds be- 
cause the land isn’t needed yet. 
That is — er — ” 

“That is what?” 

“Maybe I shouldn’t have said 
‘wild with weeds’ sir. After all, they 
have been encouraged. I’m told 
that the atmosphere smelled a lot 
stronger when Man first arrived.” 

^ I'' HE commander sniffed and 
said, “It’s pretty strong right 
now.” 

“You don’t notice it after a 
couple of months,” said Reed. 

“I don’t propose to be here that 
long,” said the commander curtly. 
“Let’s get back to your grasp of 
the overall picture.” Commander 
Breckenridge leaned back in his 
chair and said, “No doubt you 
were exposed to Early North 
American History. You will recall 
that there was a strong pioneering 
drive in the human race that went 
on almost from the date of the dis- 
covery of North America until the 
opening phases of the so-called ‘In- 
dustrial Revolution’ — that is, be- 
ginning of the electro-mechanical 
era. Am I not correct?” 

GALAXY 



“Yes, sir.” 

“Now, young man, what has be- 
come of this strong pioneering 
' drive? How did it ooze out of the 
human race? Where did it go, and 
why? Why are six billion people 
living in crowded conditions on 
Earth, while here upon Eden, Tau 
Ceti, a mere hundred thousand p>eo- 
ple occupy — by your estimate — 
some twenty million square miles? 
Why haven’t the crowded millions 
of Earth clamored for all this extra 
space?” 

“Perhaps because space travel is 
so expensive.” 

“Only in terms of cash. To be 
sure, it might take practically 
everything that a man has to buy 
passage. I now ask you to estimate 
how many men and their families 
sacrificed everything they had, 
packed a few treasured possessions 
into a Conestoga wagon and headed 
for the West.” 

“I have no way of knowing, sir.” 

“No, of course not. Let me tell 
you what happened. In that glori- 
ous phase of Early North America, 
men, women, and even their chil- 
, dren toiled from sunrise to sunset 
I to scratch out their living. From 
: the dawn of history, luxury and 
leisure belonged to the landed 
■ baron. Since wealth went with 
acreage, any man who could stake 
out a claim to acreage could also 
. claim wealth. It was a matter of 
1, finding the unclaimed acreage 
, first.” 

THE TROUBLEMAKERS 



* I ^HE commander leaned forward 
to press his point. “Then came 
the industrial revolution and the 
age of automation. Industrial slav- 
ery ended in a clank of gears. Your 
little man no longer starved to 
death nor toiled twelve hours a day. 
The finest automobile that the 
wealthy man could buy was only 
three or four times as expensive as 
the car driven by the average work- 
man. Therefore the idea of stak- 
ing out arable land as a means to 
wealth became less and less desir- 
able. Automation hit the farm. The 
landed baron changed into the 
elected presiding officer over a 
stock-secured corporation. 

“Today,” said the commander, 
“the man who leaves his home to 
migrate is not abandoning squalor 
and sorrow in the hope of finding 
something better. He’s leaving lux- 
ury, culture, and leisure. For what? 
For the privilege of scrabbling for 
a bare existence. Now, Mr. Reed, 
are you beginning to understand?” 
“I think so, sir.” 

“Good. Then you’ll begin to re- 
vise your opinion as to the impor- 
tance of extending the cruising 
range of our spacecraft.” 

Reed blinked, “Sir?” 

“Be sensible, young man. A 
colony is a waste of effort unless it 
becomes more than self-sufficient. 
Until Eden, Tau Ceti, has become 
populated to the point where Ekien 
can support her own highly techni- 
cal culture, it is an economically 

167 



unsound proposition.” The com- 
mander glared at the yoimg space- 
man. “Must I be blunt? Every ef- 
fort must be spent in raising the 
culture-level of Eden, Tau Ceti. 
That means increasing the popula- 
tion, Mr. Reed, until the numbers 
are high enough to pay for indus- 
trialization. Once the cities of 
Eden, Tau Ceti, offer the culture 
opportunity of the cities of Earth, 
then we’ll have migration on a so- 
cial level instead of the malcon- 
tents, rugged individualists, and 
petty lawbreakers who’ve been 
given the alternative of migration 
instead of incarceration. 

“Now, Mr. Reed, do you see 
what I‘m driving at? It would be 
far wiser of you to spend your time 
enhancing the aspect of Ekien, Tau 
Ceti, than trying to figure out ways 
and means of getting to more dis- 
tant stars and locating other dis- 
tant planets — to which the hu- 
man race wouldn’t migrate.” 

“But sir-” 

“Mr. Reed, I recognize in you 
the admirable spirit of adventure. 
But we must remember that this 
same spirit that once drove men 
to land on Earth’s moon in a multi- 
stage chemical rocket was not 
enough to establish a tax-paying 
colony there. Now, about this 
project of yours. You say that you 
have not yet located the flaw in 
Hansen’s Folly?” 

“No, sir, but—” 

“Mr. Reed, you realize thatyou’ll 



stay here on Eden until you do?" 

“Yes, sir, but—” 

“And the longer it takes you, the 
more ridicule will be directed at 
you, at me, and the Bureau of Oper- 
ations?” 

“But, sir-” 

“Mr. Reed, I’ll also point out 
that there will be no promotion un- 
til your assignment is complete.” 

“I’m aware of that sir, but—” 

“But what, Mr. Reed?” 

"DEED said, “Sir, may I speak 
without annoying you?” 

“If you’ve something to say, go 
ahead. I can hardly promise not to 
be annoyed before I hear what 
the subject is.” 

“Thank you, sir. In trying to 
solve Hansen’s Folly I engaged in 
some physical experiment and 
measurement because I couldn’t 
find any flaw in the mathematical 
argument on the abstract scale. As 
you know, sir, one of the ways to 
find out why something won’t work 
is to try it. It isn’t often the easiest 
or the simplest, but it is often the 
only way.” 

“So go on. What happened?” 

“Sir, my hardware works. So far 
as I can see, sir, there is no flaw! 
I was right!” 

“Commander Briggs of Re- 
search — ” 

“Sir, there must be some mis- 
take.” 

“Silence! I’m not through! Com- 
mander Briggs seems to know 
GALAXY 



168 



more about my personnel than I 
do.” 

“Sir?” 

“First, he offered to bet me a 
dinner at the Officer’s Club that 
you wouldn’t locate the flaw in 
Hansen’s Folly by the time I made 
this tour of inspection. Knowing 
that you’d probably have no other 
ambition than to leave Eden, Tau 
Ceti, I snapped at this wager like 
a starving dog latching onto a piece 
of steak. I have lost, it would appear, 
which is only one dinner. But, Mr. 
Reed, when I accepted this wager. 
Commander Briggs compounded it 
by offering to bet me a dinner for 
the whole Bureau of Resarch that 
after not finding the flaw by means 
I of the academic analysis, you’d re- 
■^sort to experiment in hardware. 
Knowing full well that you’d not 
have the temerity to divert Service 
Materiel for your own tinkering, I 
'•accepted that wager also. Then to 
top it off, Briggs added a bet of 
champagne and corsages for the 
officers’ wives that you’d complete 
your hardware and still not locate 
the flaw, and that when I arrived 
you’d be firmly convinced that 
you’d proved your point in theory 
and practice and that therefore 
you were right and the rest of the 
known universe was wrong.” 

^|''HE commander took a deep 
breath under which he swore 
gently but feelingly. Then he went 
on: “And so, Mr. Reed, I am going 



to be ‘Guest of Dishonor* at the 
Officers’ Club. I will, according to 
custom, be served the plate of 
baked S3mthetic beans whilst my 
contemporary officers and their 
wives partake of a gourmet’s ban- 
quet of natural foods.” 

“Sir, I’m sorry.” 

“Being sorry is hardly enough!” 
The commander pawed through 
his attache case until he came to a 
file-folder which he looked through 
meticulously for several minutes 
as if justifying a carefully con- 
sidered opinion. Finally he made a 
lightly pencilled note on the margin 
oi one page and said, “Lalande 
25372!” 

Junior Spaceman Howard Reed 
gasped and blurted, “Flatbush, 
sir?” 

Commander Breckenridge 
nodded curtly. “You will man the 
perimeter alien-spacecraft detec- 
tion station and the astrogation 
beacon distance and direction 
equipment located on Flatbush, 
Lalande 25372. And you will stay 
there until you have Hansen’s 
Folly completely solved. Do you 
Understand?” 

Junior Spaceman Howard Reed 
nodded unhappily. 

Lalande 25372 was close to the 
maximum range, the seventeen- 
light-year point of no return. Any 
enjoyment in knowing that he 
would have to be commissioned 
one of the finer, more efficient little 
spacecraft in order to get there in

the first place was completely 
wiped out in the knowledge that 
once there, it would have to stand 
inert awaiting his return, because 
there would be no power to spare 
on side trips. One did not, with 
subatomic power, carry a spare can 
of fuel for emergency.

IVT RS. Hanford opened the door 
and saw Scholar Ross. She 
smiled xmcertainly at him as she 
invited him in. In the Hanford 
living room, in the presence of Mr. 
Hanford, the scholar of genetics 
looked around cautiously and ques- 
tingly. Hanford said, “Gloria is 
not here. She’s out.” 

“Then I may speak openly.” 

“Of course. Is there some trou- 
ble — again?” 

“Frankly, I’m not certain,” said 
the scholar of genetics slowly. “I’d 
like more information if you’d be 
so good as to help.” 

“Of course we’ll h^lp!” ex- 
claimed Mrs. Hanford. “What’s 
bothering you?” 

“How is your daughter getting 
on with Bertram Harrison?” 
“Why, I’d guess they’re getting 
along about as well as any other 
young pre-marriage couple. That’s 
what the engagement period is for, 
isn’t it? I mean, it’s been that way 
historically.” 

“Yes, you’re right,” nodded 
Scholar Ross. “Did they rent the 



usual pre-marriage apartment?” 
“Oh yes. They were quite the 
conventional young lovers. Scholar 
Ross.” 

The man from the Department 
of Domestic Tranquility smiled. 
“And you, of course, were the con- 
ventional parents of the affianced 
bride?” 

“Of course. We were so pleased 
that we could hardly wait for 
Twelfth Night.” 

“And during that visit, were the 
appointments of the apartment 
proper?” 

“Why, Scholar Ross!” 

“No, no, Mrs. Hanford, you mis- 
understand. T implied no moral 
question. I really meant to ask if 
you knew whether Gloria and Ber- 
tram each and separately were 
properly continuing their therapy.” 
Mr. Hanford grunted. “As par- 
ents of the affianced bride,” he said, 
“we’re paying for it!” 

Mrs. Hanford blushed. “I — er — 
snooped,” she said. 

Scholar Ross looked at Mrs. 
Hanford with an expression that 
indicated that snooping was an en- 
tirely acceptable form of social 
behavior. “And what did you 
find?” . 

“Everything entirely right.” Then 
she looked doubtful and bit her 
lower lip. “Scholar Ross, I’m no au- 
thority in these matters. In Gloria’s 
bathroom were the same-looking 
kind of bottles and pills that we 
got when you prescribed, and when

» I turned on the speaker in her bed- 
I room it sounded like the same kind 
, of music as I’d heard in her bed- 
room when she was living at home. 
It — frankly — depressed me.” 

“And Bertram’s?” 

“I know less of his medication. 
But I did listen to his music outlet. 
It removed the feeling of depres- 
sion I’d gotten from Gloria’s pro- 
gram material.” 

“That’s quite right. It sounds 
reasonable.” 

S HE blushed again and looked 
at her husband. “Only one 
thing,” she said very slowly. 

‘What’s that?” 

“I — er, hardly know how to put 
it. You see, when Gerald and I 
were affianced, neither one of us 
were undergoing any kind of cor- 
rective therapy and so I don’t know 
how these things work out.” 

‘What are you driving at?” 

“Why, Scholar Ross, with neither 
of us undergoing corrective ther- 
apy, it didn’t matter which one of 
the bedrooms we used.” 

Scholar Ross considered for a 
moment and then nodded. “Of 
course,” he said with an air of com- 
plete finality. “Thafs it!” 

‘What’s it?” asked Mr. Hanford. 
“The situation becomes a simple 
. matter of reduction to the law of 
most-active reaction. Look,” he 
said, “we have one personality that 
requires an environment of stimu- 
lation to bring him up to normal. 



and another personality that re- 
quires a tranquil atmosphere to 
normal. Place them both in the 
tranquilizing environment and he 
is driven deeper into his lethargy, 
probably to the point of complete 
physical and intellectual torpor. 
Place them both in the stimulating 
atmosphere and he becomes nor- 
mal while she goes into transports 
of sensuous excitement. This ex- 
plains it!” 

“Explains what?” demanded Mr. 
Hanford. 

“Her recent behavior. Or rather 
escapade.” 

None of them heard the gentle 
snick of the lock in the front door. 

“Escapade?” exclaimed Mrs. 
Hanford. 

“We didn’t know that she was in 
any trouble,” said Mr. Hanford. 

“That’s just the point,” said 
Scholar Ross. “Your daughter has 
the infuriating habit of indulging 
in outrageous behavior under the 
name of brilliant intellectual ac- 
complishment.” 

Gloria Hanford said, “Why, 
thank you, sir!” 

She dropped the scholar a deep 
curtsey, displaying several inches 
of slender ankle. 

“Gloria!” demanded her mother. 
“What have you been up to?” 

Gloria Hanford smiled at her 
mother in an elfin, yet superior 
manner. “I am the affianced bride 
of Bertram Harrison,” she said 
softly. “Therefore my behavior. 



THE TROUBLEMAKERS 



i 



whether good, bad, or indifferent, 
is no longer the problem of my par- 
ents.” 

Her father said, “Gloria, I hap- 
pen to be big enough in both the 
physical and intellectual depart- 
ments to overrule both you and 
your husband-to-be. So you’ll an- 
swer your mother.” 

“Why,” said Gloria quietly, “I’ve 
done nothing wrong.” 

Mr. Hanford said to Scholar 
Ross: “Whafs your side of this?” 
Scholar Ross said, “Last week 
the Westchester Young People’s 
Club gave a costume ball. The 
young ladies were to attend this 
affair adorned in the authentic 
fashion of some period in the past, 
and a prize was to be awarded to 
the most novel, yet completely 
authentic costume.” 

“And,” said Gloria with a smile, 
“I won!” 

“Your daughter won because 
she has a talent for performing the 
most shocking deeds under a cloak 
of intellectual achievement.” 

“Do go on. Scholar Ross. What 
did Gloria do?” 

^HE scholar smiled wryly. 

“Style and fashion ceased to be 
logical when clothing was designed 
for sly provocation rather than as a' 
protection against a harsh environ- 
ment,” he said. ‘We live in a 
mixed-up social world. We encour- 
age communal swimming and sun 
bathing in the nude — and yet after 



five o’clock it is considered shock- 
ing to display more than the bare 
face and hands. 

“So in order to combine the max- 
imum shock-effect with the cloak 
of utter authenticity. Miss Han- 
ford researched the styles and 
fashions until she located a brief 
period of a few scant months late 
in the Twentieth Century. Her cos- 
tume consisted of a many-fold vol- 
uminous skirt of semi-transparent 
material that draped in graceful 
folds from waist to mid-calf. She 
was completely nude above the 
waist! To prove her point, she of- 
fered fashion stereos of the period 
from style magazines.” 

Gloria chuckled. “I might have 
researched back to the Old Testa- 
ment,” she said. 

Scholar Ross shook his head. 
“As I say, her shocking behavior 
could not be criticized. She could 
justify it according to the rules.” 
Mr. Hanford shook his head and 
asked, “Gloria, what did Bertram 
think of all this?” 

“Bertram carried the style ster- 
eos,” said Gloria. “There wasn’t 
any pocket in my costume.” 

Abruptly, Scholar Ross said, 
“Miss Hanford, how are you and 
Bertram getting along?” 

“As well as could be expected.” 
“Meaning what?” 

“Meaning that each of us lives 
our own life. Berty likes his seden- 
tary, torpid existence. In fact, he’d 
like to be more of a vegetable than 



172 



GALAXY 



he is. It started with his taking my 
pills and that was all right, I guess. 
But when he started sleeping in 
my bedroom so that he could esti- 
vate under the tranquilizing music 
program you prescribed for me, 
that was too much!” 

Scholar Ross looked unprece- 
dentedly astonished. “So?” he de- 
manded. 

“What do you mean ‘so?’ What 
would any red blooded woman do? 
I moved out and into his bedroom, 
naturally.” 

“And then started taking his 
medication?” asked Scholar Ross 
curtly. 

“Natch!” 

“Oh, my God!” exploded Scholar 
Ross. He eyed Gloria intently. 
“How do you manage to get Ber- 
tram awake far enough to attend 
things like your costume ball?” he 
asked. 

“Well,” she said with a smile, “I 
am really strong enough to sling a 
hundred and eighty-five pounds of 
loosely-stuffed sausage over my 
shoulder in a fireman’s carry and 
tote the inert mass back to its own 
bedroom so that its own music will 
rouse it enough to reach for its 
bedside bottles of medication. Na- 
ture then takes its course until the 
awakening. Then he goes along 
with my desires— because he knows 
that if he doesn’t, I won’t let him 
dive back into his complete inertia. 
It’s very simple. Of course, it isn’t 
much fun.” 



C CHOLAR Ross said, “Gloria, do 
you intend to continue this sort 
of self-centered, artificial life after 
you and Bertram are married?” 



“I’ve given the future very little 
thought.” 

“You always have,” said Scholar 
Ross tmhappily. “That’s been a lot 
of your trouble.” 

“So what am I supposed to do? 
Do you really expect me to marry 
that vegetable? I’ve got a life to 
lead too, you know. It may suit 
your overall program of genetics 
to breed a batch of normal chil- 
dren, but the same Book of Laws 
grants me the right to seek my own 
level of happiness.” 

“Granted—” 

‘Well, scholar, I can tell you that 
my idea of happiness is not a hus- 
band who comes into my bedroom 
walking like a somnambulist just 
barely able to cross the room be- 
fore collapsing like a loosely- 
packed sandbag.” 

“What you need,” said Scholar 
Ross firmly, “is a man who is strong 
enough to tell you what you’re go- 
ing to do.” 

“And where are you going to 
find one?” 

Scholar Ross turned from Gloria 
to her parents. “Obviously,” he said 
regretfully, “this proposed mar- 
riage between your daughter and 
Bertram Harrison is not going to 
culminate in a happy tmion.” 

“Did you expect it to?” asked 
Gloria. 



THE TROUBLEMAKERS

“I had hopes. I can only propose 
a course of action. Were yOu will- 
ing to embark upon your pre- 
scribed program of coirective ther- 
apy, and so become a normally ac- 
tive and emotionally staUe woman, 
then the marriage might work out 
very well indeed ” 

“It’s all my fault, of iedurse?” 
“Yes. Of course. The decision 
was yours to make.” 

“And how about tiiat lump of 
lard you’ve foisted pff on me?” 
“Bertram Harrison’s willing re- 
treat into total lethargy is, of 
course, his own decision. But it, too, 
is only another aspi^t of the usual 
case. The strong-willed personality 
makes its own way. The weak one 
follows.” 1 

“I see,” sneered Gloria, j'lt’s all 
my fault!” t 

“Of course it is,** snapped Scholar 
Ross. “Were you willing to correct 
yourself, you’d also have been will- 
ing to correct Bei^tram since yours 
is the stronger personality.” 

“So what’s the next move? Do I 
get to try another dolt?” 

“Hardly. You’d do the same with 
any of them.” 

“So what is it? Am I going to be 
exported to Edeji, Tau Ceti as an 
incorrigible?” 

Scholar Ross Was Silent. 

1%/f R. Hanford sard, "Certainly 
-1-*-^ there must be anbther Way?” 
Mrs. Hanford said, “Must I lose 
my daughter?” 



Scholar Ross said regretfully, 
“There is another way, of course, 
but either way is essentially a loss 
of your daughter, Mrs. Hanford.” 
Mr. Hanford said, “And what is 
this other course. Scholar Ross?” 
“It’s called re-orientation.” 
“Brain-washing!” exclaimed 
Gloria. 

“That’s a harsh, colloquial term.” 
Mrs. Hanford said, “How does 
this re-orientation work?” 

Coldly, as if he were discussing 
the repair of some inanimate en- 
gine, Scholar Ross said, “It starts 
with corrective surgery on the pitu- 
itary and thyroid glands. Next 
comes some very complicated 
neuro-cerebral surgery, somewhat 
resembling the crude, primitive 
process once called ‘Prefrontal 
Lobotomy’. Nowadays it produces 
the desired effect without all of the 
deleterious side-effects. Then, once 
the patient is completely disori- 
ented, the process of re-education 
takes place. The patient is ex- 
tremely docile and highly impres- 
sionable. All decisions carry the 
same weight — ” 

“How do you mean that?” asked 
Mr. Hanford. 

‘Why, the decision to use blue or 
black ink in your fountain pen be- 
comes as important as the decision 
of whether to cling or jump from a 
damaged aircar.” 

“Oh. And then?” 

“Why, since the patient is docile 
and impressionable, we can mold 



174 



GALAXY 



the patient’s appreciation of people, 
places, and events into conformity. 
Events of the former life are not 
erased, but they are viewed as if 
the patient had seen a trivideo 
drama instead of having been that 
person. The entire list of friends 
and acquaintances is changed be- 
cause the patient’s personality is so 
different that the former friends no 
longer have anything in common 
with the patient. It will be,” said 
Scholar Ross, “exactly as if your 
daughter left you, never to return, 
and then next year you are intro- 
duced to a strange woman who 
bears a complete resemblance to 
your daughter. To whom,” he 
added, “you eventually become 
emotionally attached because of 
your daughter’s memory.” 

“It sounds pretty drastic.” 

“I shall not fool you. It is drastic, 
indeed.” 

“I don’t like it,” Gloria snapped. 
“Yes,” pleaded Mrs. Hanford. 
‘What is the alternative?” 

“E!den, Tau Ceti. I’ll arrange 
transportation under the migration 
act, and she’ll be permitted two 
hundred pounds of gross.” Scholar 
Ross smiled thinly. “You can diet 
a few pounds off and thus increase 
the net weight of your allowable 
possessions,” he said. “But, on the 
other hand, if you diet down to rail- 
skinny no one will take a chance 
on you.” 

Gloria demanded belligerently, 
“What am I, a raffle prize?” 



“Why, that’s no better than 
white slavery}” cried her mother. 

“Oh, come now!” said Scholar 
Ross. “Miss Hanford will receive a 
home and a hard-working husband 
on a fine new world with unlimited 
opportunities.” 

Gloria Hahford snorted. “The 
term, ‘unlimited opportunit 3 ^ is 
just the optimist’s way of describ- 
ing a situation that the pessimist 
would call, ‘l?^ck of modern con- 
veniences.’” 

‘Well, Miss Hanford, you have 
your choice. One of three. Correc- 
tive therapy and marriage with 
Bertram Hnsrisoo; total re-orienta- 
tion; or migration to Eden, Tau 
Cetii I’ll not ask for your decision 
now. Give me your answer within 
thirty days.” 

“ Y ou can’t force me!” 

“No. I can’t. All I can do is to 
point out your three avenues of 
future travel and then point out 
that I do have the means of making 
your life so very inconvenient that 
you’ll have no recourse but to make 
your choice from among the three 
desirable possibilities. Desirable, I 
must admit, means that which is 
most favorable to the furtherance 
of domestic tranquility!”

teen point nine light years froni 
Sol, about fifteen degrees north of 
the celestial equator and not quite 
opposite the vernal equinox. It has 
planets, but this does not make 
Lalande 25372 unique. Like most 
of the planets foimd in space, 
neither mad dogs nor Englishmen 
would have anything to do with 
them — willingly. They are suit-

The planet Flatbush, Lalande

obscure medieval reference to a 
form of punishment known as 
“Walking a beat in Flatbush,” if 
we are to believe MacClelland’s 
authoritative volume The Origin 
of Place Names. 

Observed through the multipane 
window of the Station, Flatbush, 
Lalande 25372, was a pleasant 
enough planet, provided one could 
ignore the fact that there was not 
a sign nor trace of vegetation from 
the Installation Building to the 
horizon. A couple of himdted yards 
from the building there was a 
pleasant looking lake. The lake 
was indeed water, but it contained 
dissolved substances that would 
have poisoned a boojum snark. 
The warm wind of Flatbush rip- 
pled the surface of the lake, but no 
square yard of sail would be 
hoisted until someone first built a 
gas mask that would filter out the 
colorless gases that turned silver 



black. Fluffy clouds floated across 
the sky, but they rained down a 
mess that etched stainless steel. 

Out There, near the perimeter 
of Man’s five-parsec range of oper- 
ations, subelectromagnetic detec- 
tor beams scoured the sky. Taking 
the most pessimistic standpoint — 
the least possible combinations of 
Nature’s infinite variety of envi- 
ronment — Nature’s own profligacy 
with life-forms still demanded that 
somewhere. Out There, another 
race was plying the spaceways. 

Someday this hypothetical race 
was certain to touch wings with 
mankind. 

When that took place it was the 
duty of the Bureau of Operations 
to detect them, to intercept them, 
and to warn the men of Earth, Sol, 
that Mankind was no longer alone. 
The fact that the subelectromag- 
netic detecting beams had been 
sweeping space for a couple of hun- 
dred years without detecting any- 
thing had no bearing on the future. 
The beams must be maintained so 
long as a human man remained 
alive in space. 

In addition to the detector 
beams, the outlying planets car- 
ried astrogation beacons. They 
were subelectromagnetic light- 
houses, so to speak, that rang across 
space with known direction and 
ranging telemetered signals. Some- 
day, Man hoped to fill the space 
lanes with spacecraft and the plan- 
ets with interstellar commerce.

Someday there might be an- 
other Marie Celeste plying its 
course with its crew inexplicably 
missing. But if this ever happened, 
it was not going to happen without 
the Space Service knowing pre- 
cisely how many and which space- 
craft were operating through that 
volume of space before, during, and 
. after D-for-Disaster Day and M- 
for-Mysterious Minute. 

The equipment, of course, was 
■ automated to modem perfection, 
with multi-lateral channels that 
I would take over in case of com- 
[ ponent failure. Its factor of relia- 
• bility was well above six or seven 
: nines of perfection. But to admit 
that this perfection was adequate 
would have deprived the Space 
Service of a convenient minor 
penal detail to take care of brash 
junior officers. Manning such a sta- 
tion provided the junior officer with 
a wealth of time to contemplate his 
sins, and to mend his evil ways. 

In the case of Junior Spaceman 
Howard Reed, this process con- 
sisted of locating the flaw that pre- 
vented Hansen’s Folly from being 
: Hansen’s Analysis.

’ have succeeded in raising their

I 



level of modern technical conveni- 
ences. 

Like them — having been unable 
to locate the flaw in Hansen’s Folly 
by the theoretical approach during 
his tour of duty on Earth, Sol, and 
having similarly failed to locate the 
error in experimental hardware 
during his tour of duty on Eden, 
Tau Ceti — Junior Spaceman 
Howard Reed began to experiment 
on the spacecraft that stood parked 
on its launching pad two hundred 
feet from the Installation. There 
was plenty of equipment to work 
with. The Space Service did not 
stock its perimeter stations in a 
slipshod manner. 

Furthermore, Junior Spaceman 
Howard Reed had plenty of time. 

The account of his life and ad- 
ventures is hardly worth telling. 
He had no distractions. He worked 
The months passed one after the 
other. 

Flatbush, Lalande 25372 was so 
far out that there was no provision 
made for a regular tour of inspec- 
tion. Nobody bothered to drop in 
on Junior Spaceman Howard 
Reed. Gabbling on the official com- 
munication channels was strictly 
forbidden, so the young junior offi- 
cer was denied even contact by 
voice. No one had come up with an 
economically sound means of pro- 
ducing entertainment programs 
from Earth, Sol, on the subelectro- 
magnetic beams and so he — like 
his fellows in the other perimeter 



177 



stations — received neither news 
nor music from home. 

He could terminate this tour of 
duty only by solving the riddle of 
Hansen’s Folly, and then notifying 
his superiors on the official com- 
munications channels — or by tuck- 
ing a note in the once-each-year 
supply drone that came laden with 
enough of Earth’s environment to 
keep the young expatriate alive for 
another year. 

The set-up was wholly condu- 
cive to work. There was time and 
there was equipment; his orders 
were to remain there imtil he had 
studied his way through the prob- 
lem. 

With nothing else to do, Junior 
Spaceman Howard Reed was deep 
in his investigation . when the 
drone spacecraft came down along 
the subelectromagnetic beacon and 
made its landing a dozen yards 
away. 

The drone was standard space- 
craft size, an unmanned hull laden 
with the necessities of life that 
would support him for a year. 

It was the first one that he had 
ever seen. This was the first time 
that Junior Spaceman Howard 
Reed had had to face the problem 
of Supply. Packed in that drone- 
ship was enough earth environ- 
ment to last a man a year. The 
perishables and expendables, as 
well as replacement for the lost 
fractions of the recyclables, were 
all there. They were dehydrated 



and deep frozen after all waste had 
been removed, then compressed 
into cubes of identical size for the 
most favorable packing fraction. 
Even so, it was a prodigious 
amount of stuff. Supply would 
have been impossible on a once- 
per-year basis, if the foul water of 
Flatbush, Lalande 25372, hadn’t 
been distillable with ease. 

T he junior spaceman eyed the 
droneship with a sudden burst 
of pride in his fellow man’s ac- 
complishment. Given a pre-pro- 
grammed flight along telemetered 
beacons originating at either termi- 
nus, the rimning equipment within 
the drone would bulk much less 
than the same mass and size as a 
human and his needs. Until flight- 
decisions were necessary, the hard- 
ware pilot was as good as the human 
pilot — and far less subject to head- 
ache, tantrum, disappointment at 
not getting the Saturday night pass 
and resentment over being passed 
by at promotion time. 

Then his pride gave way to sud- 
den, prolonged thought. 

The range of a spacecraft is com- 
puted from point of takeoff to point 
of no return. There was no way of 
restoring the powerbanks of a 
spacecraft except on Earth, Sol. 

Now, of course, it is entirely pos- 
sible to take off and just keep going 
until the powerbanks are depleted. 

That will cover twice the stated 
range to the point of no return. 



178 



qALAXY 



Ships have gone out and off and 
away and have never been heard 
of again. It is possible that one or 
more of these have succeeded in 
locating an Earth-like planet be- 
yond the point of no return, but 
the Earthmen at home will never 
know about it until the range is 
extended. The possibility of such 
a planet favoring human life and 
ultimately harboring a culture of 
technical competence enough to 
create and maintain the power re- 
storing equipment is extremely 
remote. 

For spacecraft that carry women 
are few and far between. 

And it takes more than one 
man’s lifetime to make use of the 
•knowhow. 

Junior Spaceman Howard Reed 
knew that away back in the Twen- 
tieth Century, the average engineer 
could make a guess, coimt on his 
fingers, and come up with a pretty 
shrewd estimate of the horsepower 
per cubic inch that could be stored 
by the various ways and means 
available to the age. 

Removing the human pilot and 
his needs did give the droneship 
quite a bit more space for cargo 
and power. But, as he looked at the 
droneship standing there, it be- 
came plain to Junior Spaceman 
Howard Reed that there was not 
room in that size of hull for both 
the necessary powerbanks and the 
full year’s store of supplies for one 
man. 



Whereupon Jimior Spaceman 
Howard Reed ffiopped his tools. 
He donned his space suit and 
crossed the intervening space to 
the droneship. 

He began to examine the ship’s 
rimning gear with a critical and 
suspicious eye. 

He was examining hardware 
that was familiar to him. It took 
him no more than two hours to 
determine beyond a shadow of a 
doubt that the droneship’s drive 
was built along the theories and 
mathematical analysis that he had 
been told simply did not work! 

Someone had reduced Hansen’s 
Folly to practice! 

XT E paused again. Hansen’s 
Folly had been called a fail- 
ure about two hundred years ago, 
but what did that really mean? He 
considered his history. 

In 1724, Stephen Gray and 
Granville Wheeler made the proud 
announcement that they had suc- 
ceeded in transmitting an electri- 
cal phenomenon along a wire for 
a distance of 682 feet. Two hun- 
dred years later the entire Earth 
was girdled with telegraph, tele- 
phone and cable wires and linked 
with the invisible bonds of radio 
waves. 

In about 1904 the Wright Broth- 
ers made their first powered air- 
plane flight. Forty years later men 
were flying in airplanes that car- 
ried a wingspread greater than the 



THE TROUBLEMAKERS 



179 



distance of the Wright’s first flight. 

Einstein’s Barrier was accepted 
scientific dogma for a hundred 
years; but he, Howard Reed, was 
now standing in a spacecraft that 
had crossed the gulf between the 
stars at a speed that not only ex- 
ceeded the velocity of propagated 
light — but exceeded this speed by 
a few hundred orders of magnitude. 

So? So maybe they were right. 
Maybe Hansen’s Folly was a 
failure. 

But the running gear in this 
droneship was designed to the 
analysis produced by Junior Space- 
man Howard Reed, and it worked. 
Furthermore, he had only the 
scornful word of Commander 
Briggs of the Bureau of Research 
that his arguments had been paral- 
lel to those of the hapless Hansen. 

It would hardly be the first time 
in the history of the human race 
that some bureaucrat got fat on the 
work of his cmderlings who not 
only received no credit for their 
work, but were often hushed, hid- 
den, or otherwise prevented from 
proving their right to the fame and 
fortune. 

Angrily, Howard Reed stood up 
and cursed. They were not going 
to smother him in a peg-whittling 
job on a single-man p>ost sixteen 
light years from home base, denied 
of all but official communications. 

He was going to find out about 
this very strange business! 

Junior Spaceman Howard Reed 



did not even bother going back to 
the Station. Its Outside detectors 
had been sweeping deep space for 
a couple of hundred years without 
detecting anything; its astrobea- 
cons were employed once each 
year when the droneship arrived. 
Furthermore, both equipments 
were automatic, on the trips, set up 
to bypass the one-man crew of the 
Station by transmitting the infor- 
mation on the regular Channels. 

So, there in the droneship, the 
junior spaceman merely discon- 
nected the pre-programmed auto- 
pilot, clamped his hands around 
the manual gear, and took off for 
far-off Earth, Sol.

G loria Hanford opened her 
apartment door, made a dou- 
ble take when she saw the living 
room lights were on, toted up the 
list of unexpected guests, and as- 
sessed the situation in one brief 
moment. She stopped short on one 
high heel, pivoted, and said to her 
escort, “Not tonight, Joseph!” 
“But-” 

'Tve guests,” she said, placing a 
hand flat on her escort’s chest. 
“But-” 

“My guests mean trouble,” she 
finished, shoving. Her escort disap- 
peared — walking backward and 
still trying to protest 

Gloria closed the loving room 
door with a gesture of finality, then

GALAXY 



turned to lean back against it She 
faced her vmexpected guests with 
an air of exasperated patience, as 
if by her silence she was inviting 
them to hurl the first bolt and by 
her attitude confident that she 
could turn it aside with ease. 

She did not have long to wait. 

They all started to talk at once. 
The resulting babble was unintel- 
ligible and the sound of the others’ 
voices made each one of them stop 
without finishing. Silence fell 
again, and in the calm, Scholar 
Ross spoke up : 

“Under the circumstances. Miss 
Hanford, I think we have the right 
to ask that you explain your 
actions.” 

Mr. Harrison grimted. “I say 
this is a waste of time. Let’s get 
along with it.” 

Mrs. Harrison added, “Yes in- 
deed, Scholar Ross. If you’ll call 
the authorities, we’ll sign the com- 
plaint.” 

Mrs. Hanford snapped, “I re- 
sent the implication that my daugh- 
ter is wholly and solely in the 
wrong.” 

Mr. Hanford said, “In my opin- 
ion, Bertram Harrison isn’t bright 
enough to come in out of the rain, 
let alone being smart enough to 
know what’s good for him. Now — ” 

Mr. Harrison growled, “We 
come calling this evening and find 
our son deep under the influence 
of tranquilizers and the catalytic 
action of the mood music pre- 



scribed for this philandering young 
hussy—” 

“I’m no philanderer!” cried 
Gloria. “I’m not married to your 
cold lump of lard!” 

Scholar Ross spead out his hands 
in a gesture of supplication, as if 
he were pleading with the gods for 
a return to sanity. “Stop it!” he 
cried. “Stop it!” 

H e turned to Mrs. Hanford with 
a shake of theliead. “I am sor- 
ry. Your resentment of the fact that 
this affair is your daughter’s respon- 
sibility is not going to change it.” 
“But he’s-” 

“Please, Mrs. Hanford. This en- 
gagement is not a matter of the per- 
sonal choice of the participants. It 
gravely concerns Society. Now, in- 
sofar as the Department of Domes- 
tic Tranquility is concerned, it is 
the excitable, headstrong, unruly, 
willful personality that is danger- 
ous to social stability. The calm 
and placid ones do not commit acts 
of violence. Indeed, Mrs. Hanford, 
were it not for the quiet, phleg- 
matic personality like Bertram 
Harrison, we in genetics would 
have a hard time finding a useful 
niche for belligerents such as your 
daughter Gloria.” 

Gloria Hanford said something 
under her breath. Scholar Ross 
eyed her suspiciously and de- 
manded that she repeat. 

“Cliche Sixteen,” she retorted. 



THE TROUBLEMAKERS 



181 



“It pertains to tiie problem of lead- 
ing horses to water.” 

He nodded. “Yes. The horse is 
laudably exercising as much free 
will as his equine position permits 
him. The same platitude can also 
be employed to point out that blind 
stubbornness may prevent him 
from doing something that is real- 
ly a good idea even if someone else 
did think of it first.” 

“I say enough of this nonsense!” 
snapped Mr. Harrison. “Let’s get 
this debate over with!” 

“Now, just a moment,” said 
Scholar Ross. “You have no legal 
standing. Miss Hanford is Bertram 
Harrison’s affianced wife. Under 
law, any difficulties between them 
are strictly a civic matter. Bluntly, 
sir, only the party being damaged 
can sign a complaint, and after 
making a complaint it is up to the 
complaining party to prove that he 
is being damaged at the will of the 
accused.” 

“Scholar Ross, you and your De- 
partment of Domestic Tranquility 
may know how you hope to main- 
tain a calm and stable social struc- 
ture, but you don’t know much 
about the law,” said Mr. Harrison 
slowly and carefully. “One only 
need go back to the early days of 
common law to find a rather terse 
discussion of the proposition of 
maintaining an attractive nuisance. 
The owner of the attractive 
nuisance has a responsibility to the 



gullible citizens who are attracted.” 
“Meaning?” 

“Meaning,” said Mr. Harrison, 
“that Miss Hanford in this pre-mar- 
riage apartment did maintain a 
series of attractive nuisances. Tran- 
quilizer pills. Soothing mood mu- 
sic. A person of calm tendencies 
would find them most attractive. 
It was therefore her responsibility 
to protect the other party. Now — 
when Bertram has been properly 
treated and is able to testify — 
I think we’ll find that Miss Hanford 
not only failed to protect Bertram, 
but indeed encouraged him to help 
himself to her pills and sleep in her 
bedroom under the soothing influ- 
ence of the mood music prescribed 
for her.” 

M r. Hanford snapped, “If this 
attractive nuisance is as you 
say, Harrison, why can’t we charge 
that Bertram did little to protect 
Gloria from his own therapy?” 
Scholar Ross raised a hand. “Per- 
mit me,” he said, “to reiterate that 
it is the hypertonic, overactive 
p>ersonalities that create social 
troubles. A Bertram Harrison 
lulled into a semi-cataleptic state 
by the wiles of a Gloria Hanford 
would hardly be expected to rise 
in a sudden burst of strength.” 

“So no matter what I do, I’m 
wrong?” the girl asked. 

“Not at all,” said Scholar Ross. 
“It is your direct responsibilty — 



182 



GALAXY 



your duty — to do eversdhing you 
can to establish a firm and stable 
family unit here with Bertram Har- 
rison—” 

“Sorry, Scholar Ross,” said Mr. 
Harrison icily. “You haven’t really 
heard me. Your notion that this af- 
fair is a civil argument between an 
affianced couple is not true. You 
imply that no laws have been 
broken. You are wrong. I am will- 
ing to sign a complaint right now 
that Miss Gloria Hanford deliber- 
ately induced my son to indulge in 
her therapy. It was her means of 
lulling him into a state of mind that 
would permit her to go gallivanting 
off on a date with another man.” 

“I am not married to Berty yet!” 
snapped Gloria. “Dating’s still my 
right!” 

“Oh,” snarled Mr. Harrison an- 
grily, “shut up or I’ll sign a com- 
plaint that you administered medi- 
cal treatment without a license! In- 
sofar as the Harrison family is con- 
cerned, this engagement shall be 
terminated unfavorably. Come!” he 
said to his wife. She rose to follow. 

Gloria stepped aside, but paused 
to ask, “Aren’t you going to take 
Bertie with you?” 

Mrs. Hanford said coldly, “He’s 
already been taken to the hospital 
for treatment to bring him out of 
the trance you got him into. And 
so. Miss Hanford, will you please 
step aside and let me pass?” 

And Mr. Harrison’s parting shot 



was, “I shall sign my complaints in 
the morning— or if he is able, we’ll 
make it thoroughly legal and have 
Bertram sign them.” 

He closed the door firmly. 

Mrs. Hanford wailed, “Now 
what shall we do?” 

Scholar Ross shook his head. 
“With this poor record, this non- 
cooperation,” he said slowly, “it will 
be well nigh impossible to arrange 
another union. iFurthermore, if 
Harrison carries out his threat—” 
Gloria said quickly, “If he wants 
to, he can talk Bertie into anything. 
Anything. Such as signing the most 
frightful complaints and being con- 
vinced of their absolute truth and 
justice.” 

Mr. Hanford said, “If that’s true, 
he could also be talked back out 
of them.” 

Scholar Ross shook his head 
again. “That presupposes that you 
could arrange access to Bertram 
that couldn’t be overcome by an- 
other talking-to by his parents. It 
won’t work. The young man is a 
mental weathervane.” 

“So where do we stand?” 

“As I say, we might as well pre- 
pare for the worst. If the case of 
Gloria Hanford ever comes under 
the scrutiny of the Law, she will be 
declared either a delinquent or 
an incorrigible, depending upon 
whether her escapades are ruled 
misdemeanors or felonies.” Scholar 
Ross turned to Gloria Hanford. “I

warned you. Now, where we of the 
Department of Domestic Tran- 
quility have no power to force you 
into a proper course of action, you’ll 
find that the Law most certainly 
has. Miss Hanford, the Law will 
decide just how dangerous you are 
to the civic peace. Upon that de- 
cision, the law will further decide 
what action it must take to protect 
that civic peace from you.” 

He paused. A silence followed 
his statements. He waited a few 
moments to let his words sink in. 
Then he walked to the door and 
said: 

“As of now, the future of Miss 
Gloria Hanford is out of my hands.” 
Mr. Hanford said, “Scholar Ross, 
how bad is this likely to be?” 

“A lot will depend upon how 
swiftly Bertram Harrison responds 
to the restorative treatment. With 
some luck and a brilliant attorney 
on your side the matter might not 
reach a major catastrophe. Tomor- 
row may tell.” 

IX 

J UNIOR Spaceman Howard 
Reed said plaintively, “But this 
is the Bureau of Justice. According 
to the Regulations you are sup- 
posed to listen to me, at least.” 
The space officer behind the 
desk wore the three wide stripes of 
the commander’s rank, topped by 
the fasces that symbolized the law. 
He was Commander Hughes, chief 
184 



of the Space Service Bureau of Jus- 
tice. He smiled at the junior space- 
man but shook his head. “You 
would place us in a most difficult 
position were we to heed your plea 
without having the matter referred 
to us through official channels.” 
With some exasperation, Reed 
said, “Look, sir, I’ve been subject 
to a severe injustice. Why can’t I 
at least tell my problem to some- 
one?” 

“That would be cutting across 
channels. It simply is not done.” 
“Commander Hughes,” said the 
junior spaceman earnestly, “you’re 
not serving justice. You’re ob- 
structing it!” 

“Now see here, young man—” 
“Commander Hughes, you’re in- 
sisting that I request my superior 
officer to forward through official 
channels a complaint against him. 
First, sir, I point out that he would 
refuse my request unless he were 
absolutely certain that my case 
against him was ridiculously weak. 
Second, I’m certain that the re- 
quest would bring quick retalia- 
tion.” 

Commander Hughes shook his 
head. “The Regulation provides 
that any reasonable request be for- 
warded. And the Regulation fur- 
ther provides that there shall be no 
punitive action.” 

Reed snorted. “Fine. And if I do 
find myself punished, must I next 
forward my request for investiga- 
tion through the same officer?” 

GALAXY 



“That is a serious charge, young 
man.” 

“I can substantiate it! Look, sir, 
quite a long time ago I made some 
scientific studies, and—” 

“You’re an Operations officer, 
Mr. Reed?” 

“Yes, but-” 

“Then you’re not trained in sci- 
ence?” 

“Let’s not go on that rat-race 
right now,” said the junior space- 
man testily. “I’ve heard it before. 
That’s why I’m here!” 

“Very well.” 

Junior Spaceman Howard Reed 
took a deep breath and plunged 
into his long explanation. At the 
end, Commander Hughes nodded, 
his face in a non-committal mask. 

“One moment now,” he said. He 
turned to the working desk behind 
him and spoke into a telephone. 
It had neither visual plate nor am- 
plified output; only the user could 
know what was being communi- 
cated, and with whom. 

“Now we’ll see,” said the com- 
mander as he hung up the tele- 
phone. 

TJ^ITH the awkwardness of a 
** stopped trivideo drama they 
stood and sat there motionless and 
silently as the minutes dragged 
past. Ultimately there was a gen- 
tle alarm ring from one of the 
desk drawers. Commander Hughes 
opened it to extract a couple of 
yards of stereofac paper. 

THE TROUBLEMAKERS 



“Your service record,” explained 
the commander, picking up a read- 
ing prism and starting at the top. 
“Just another moment.” 

Another half dozen minutes 
went past. 

“ ‘Junior Spaceman Howard 
Reed,’ ” the commander read quiet- 
ly at last, “ ‘has^ an exemplary rec- 
ord.’ That is Commander Brecken- 
ridge’s opinion, if we are to believe 
what we read in this record. Oh, 
perhaps, he thought, a bit head- 
strong and mildly argumentative, 
factors which he considered bal- 
anced by a faculty for deep con- 
centration.” 

“And how about my being trans- 
ferred to Eden, Tau Ceti? And 
then to Flatbush, Lalande 25372?” 
Reed demanded. 

‘“Reasons for transfer,’” read 
Commander Hughes from the rec- 
ord. “‘Junior Spaceman Howard 
Reed is ambitious and overactive. 
In the considered opinion of Com- 
mander Breckenridge, he will 
make a fine superior officer once 
his duty-experience has the proper 
breadth.’ ” The commander looked 
up and waved a hand at the length 
of stereofac. The fasces wrought in 
gold above the stripes glittered in 
the light “Were it not for the Regu- 
lations against permitting a jvmior 
officer to inspect his own service 
record,” said Commander Hughes 
with a smile, “I’d let you see for 
yourself that nowhere on this rec- 
ord is there a single word that cor- 

185 




roborates your suggestion. Your 
tour of duty on Flatbush, Lalande 
25372, and your earlier transfer 
to Eden, Tau Ceti, were merely the 
standard tour of duty, granted to 
satisfactory jimior officers as a 
means of properly broadening their 
experience.” 

“In other words,” snapped Reed 
angrily, “the fact that I have 
crossed space in a craft powered by 
186 



a technical suggestion made by me 
some years ago does not prove a 
thing.” 

“Can you prove that you made 
any such technical suggestion?” 
“Yes. Call Commander Briggs of 
the Bureau of Research. Call Com- 
mander Breckenridge of the Bu- 
reau of Operations. Demand that 
they state under oath, whether I 
did or did not make such sugges- 
GALAXY 



tions. I was told my ideas were 
worthless.” 

“In other words, the Bureau of 
Research says it wouldn’t work?” 
“But look, sir! I drove a space- 
craft all the way from—” 

'■ I '' HE Bureau of Justice officer 
held up a hand. 

“Look,” said the junior space- 
man angrily, “all I want is justice!” 
THE TROUBLEMAKERS 



“And justice you’ll get!” retorted 
Commander Hughes. “First, Mr. 
Reed, let me ask how you obtained 
permission to leave your post on 
Flatbush, Lalande 25372, so that 
you could come to the headquar- 
ters in person to state your plea? 
Or was this trip authorized?” 
“Well, sir — the detector and 
beacon stations are completely au- 
tomated and — ” 



187 



“In blunt terms you are absent 
without leave?” 

“Well, sir-” 

“Junior Spaceman Howard 
Reed, you will consider yourself 
under personal arrest. We have no 
alternative but to place you in the 
custody of the Space Security Po- 
lice. Remain as you were!” 

Like the fabled case of the 
drowning man. Junior Spaceman 
Howard Reed reviewed his past in 
a single flash before his eyes. In 
the second blink, he covered his 
present. It wasn’t to his liking. 

Having covered his past and dis- 
carded his present, he next in- 
spected his most probable future 
and came to the almost immediate 
conclusion that there wasn’t very 
much in it for him. He had never 
heard Napoleon’s statement that 
God was on the side with the 
heaviest artillery, but, in his own 
way. Junior Spaceman Howard 
Reed came to a parallel conclusion. 
Justice was on the side of the 
heaviest rank. Bitterly, he reflected 
that the reward for a technical sug- 
gestion of great merit was that they 
wouldn’t make any trouble for him 
— so long as he didn’t try to claim 
credit for it. 

He came back to his danger- 
ous present quickly. Commander 
Hughes was talking briskly into his 
secret telephone. 

With a quick gesture, the junior 
spaceman leaned forward over the 
desk and snatched the instrument 



out of the senior officer’s hands. He 
hauled in on the connecting cord 
imtil it came taut, and then he 
yanked, ripping the cord from its 
terminals. Brusquely, he dropped 
the telephone instrument into the 
commander’s waste basket. 

Then as bells began to ring and 
corridor horns began to sound, 
Junior Spaceman Howard Reed 
left the administration building of 
the Bureau of Justice on a dead 
run. Out in the street the wail of 
a siren began to climb from its 
throaty basso to its ear-splitting 
ululation.

^ LORIA Hanford awoke, as she 
always did, with full aware- 
ness, like the transition of a small 
animal from slumber to flight. It 
was not a languid hand that 
reached for the telephone that had 
awakened her but an alert one. It 
flipped the accept button up and 
the vidphone eye button down in 
a single twisting gesture of thumb 
and forefinger. It was not modesty 
that caused the turn-down of the 
vidphone eye. It was vanity. Gloria 
Hanford deemed unbrushed teeth, 
uncombed hair, and imwashed face 
both unacceptable and unattrac- 
tive. 

“Gloria Hanford here. Go ahead.” 

“Scholar Ross calling. Miss Han- 
ford, you should know so that you 
can be prepared. Bertram Harrison 
GALAXY

has not yet responded to correc- 
tive therapy.” 

“Not — yet — responded.” she 
repeated slowly. “Just how bad is 
this. Scholar Ross?” 

“It is quite grave. It’s possible 
there may be cerebral deteriora- 
tion.” 

“You mean Bertram might evdh 
go from bad to worse?” 

“Miss Hanford, will you cease 
treating this as if it were a comedy? 
You may be defending yourself 
against charges of criminal negli- 
gence. It might even get to the 
charge of homicide before it’s 
done.” 

“Homicide? But he isn’t dead!” 
“Fifth degree homicide,” said 
Scholar Ross, “comprises the proc- 
ess of causing by any means the 
loss of impairment of personality 
or intellect. In layman’s terms, 
brainwashing.” 

“So?” 

“So if I were you I’d dress and 
be ready for the authorities. Harri- 
son forced a special session of court 
last night and had Bertram de- 
clared as invalid-incommunicado. 
Since your engagement was for- 
mally dissolved, this places Ber- 
tram’s well-being under the dis- 
cretion of his next-of-kin blood 
relations. Father Harrison is pre- 
pared to prosecute to the fullest ex- 
tent. He’s even petitioned for the 
right to take action against the 
Department of Domestic Tran- 
quility for what he calls ‘incom- 
THE TROUBLEMAKERS 



petent meddling.’ So you see, it 
looks bad.” 

“Maybe there ought to be some 
thoughtful laws passed to protect 
we active ones from the dolts and 
dullards,” said Gloria. “Okay, 
Scholar Ross, I’ll take steps!” 

In a flurry of expert motion, 
Gloria Hanford dressed, packed, 
and left. 

The authorities who came for 
her hadn’t had enough experience 
in dealing with the hypertonic, 
overactive, fast-thinking, anti-so- 
cial type. They expected to find a 
slightly fuzzy-minded, still half- 
aslumber girl, unable to grasp both 
an idea and a dressing gown at the 
same time. They would not have 
equated their notion with the trim, 
alert, neatly and completely 
dressed young lady they passed on 
the stairs if it hadn’t been for the 
standard, legal locks on all apart- 
ment doors. A tiny flag filled a 
small aperture only when the full 
bolt was cast home by a flip of the 
inside key. 

Its absence meant that no one 
was inside. 

The chief of the group forced 
his mental image through a men- 
tal photomontage that started with 
the original picture of the half- 
awakened young woman tossing a 
tousle of hair back out of one eye, 
passed through a much-abridged 
version of the process of female 
dressing, and concluded with the 
trim and striking number they’d 



189 



passed on the stairway. Add im- 
portant item: As an accessory, 
whistle-bait was also carrying an 
overnight bag in one formal-for- 
travelling, white-gloved hand. 

Nudged, his memory was good. 

He hauled his handset out while 
his men were still making dead cer- 
tain that the little flag on the lock 
meant precisely what it said. By 
the time they were convinced that 
the apartment was truly empty and 
the lock bolted from the outside, 
he had unabashedly reported his 
failure, and was concluding a very 
excellent description of the fugi- 
tive Gloria Hanford. 

XI 

^ I '' HE average citizen, faced with 
an impressive uniform, falls in- 
to one of two very widely divided 
camps. One of these camps contains 
those of us who are impressed by 
the visible, exalted rank of the 
wearer. 

So, by the simple process of 
snapping, “Official business!” at 
the driver of a skycab and simul- 
taneously tossing the driver his of- 
ficial I. D. card in its ornate leather 
folder, Junior Spaceman Howard 
Reed succeeded in commandeer- 
ing a skycab. 

He took off, leaving the driver 
in a razzle-dazzle dream of collect- 
ing mileage from the Space Service 
whilst he spent the time comfort- 
ably relaxing in a pub. Protected 
190 



from public gaze by the camouflag- 
ing skycab, the junior spaceman 
proceeded to cruise up the middle 
level of Ancient Fifth Avenue, 
driving a full eighteen inches be- 
low the legal altitude set for cruis- 
ing skycabs. 

He turned on his pocket set to 
listen to the details of the search 
that was being organized for him. 

Above him, all around him, even 
in the subways below him, the vast 
and efficient organization of the 
Military Space Service was con- 
verging. This organization had the 
will and the manpower to scour 
this city of twenty million people 
almost literally soul by soul if the 
need be, to locate a young officer 
in the uniform of a Junior Space- 
man. He might be driving a Mili- 
tary Vehicle, but more likely would 
be found in one of the many pub- 
lic vehicles or public carriers that 
the city offered for civilian trans- 
portation. There was also the high 
possibility that Junior Spaceman 
Howard Reed might be located 
afoot on the static sidewalk or on 
one of the tramways. 

And so, mentally clocking each 
time-point and making a careful 
note of the check-points, the junior 
spaceman built up a mental map of 
the city and its danger points. Un- 
til the laws of simple logic failed 
to operate, he was going to be ex- 
actly where they weren’t. 

He was, in the driver’s seat of a 
skycab, precisely as invisible as 
GALAXY 



The Purloined Letter. But now, if 
he were to drive his skycab away 
from the cruising level, he needed 
one more accessory. He had time. 
So long as the Military was look- 
ing for a Military man in Military 
surroundings and in a Military 
manner, he was as safe from de- 
tection as if he really owned the 
skycab he’d commandeered. 

The civilian police were closer to 
success. 

Called by the chief of the arrest- 
ing party who’d arrived at Gloria 
Hanford’s apartment too late by 
minutes, the minions of Law and 
Order converged in their civilian 
efficiency. Logistically, it was a 
simple matter of hare and hounds. 
The hare couldn’t win. Only one 
question was important: Which of 
the hounds would? 

Afoot and by jetcopter that en- 
globed the area, they closed in. 
By the application of stored memo- 
ry and studied information they 
erected invisible barriers at every 
exposed point along the most prob- 
able trail of their quarry, from the 
street outside of her apartment 
door to the garage stall in Monti- 
cello. Then, as a final clincher, they 
installed three men in Gloria Han- 
ford’s airscooter itself. 

By virtue of the unexpected 
movement one can elude the cops 
for a time. Gloria, on the street be- 
fore her apartment building, almost 
went into despair when she saw 
that there was no skycab within 
THE TROUBLEMAKERS 



hailing distance. She almost took 
it as a personal affront. 

But this was hardly the time to 
stamp her sandals on the hard pave- 
ment or to write letters to the Com- 
missioner of Public Carriers. 

Q HE turned and disappeared into 
the tramway entrance heading 
North along Waterfront Avenue. 
Her coin had hardly hit the bottom 
of its slot when the mobile police 
converged to land on the spot she’d 
just vacated. The foremost of them 
saw her trim figure disappearing in- 
to the distance, eclipsed by the 
myriads of innocent souls whose 
only desire was to make use of the 
same Northbound Tramway. 

The pursuit began to reshape its 
surface of detection from englobe- 
ment to a cylinder, the axis of 
which lay congruent with the 
Northbound Tramway. 

Again, she held the advantage 
of knowing her own decision where- 
as her pursuit had to divine her 
plans by analysis of her actions 
and making use of extrapolation. 
Gloria Hanford abruptly stepped 
off the Tramway at Fifty-third, 
walked briskly three long blocks 
to LaGuardia’s Sixth, found her- 
self facing a group of burly police- 
men, and stopped long enough to 
think. One of the cops shoved a 
galton whistle between his teeth 
and blew a supersonic blast that 
registered on every cop’s detector 
within a quarter mile. Audibly a 

191 



siren wailed. Inaudibly and invis- 
ibly the drawstring web of civic 
forces began to close in. 

Once more Gloria stepped into 
the kiosk of a tramway, the Cross- 
town. She rode one more block to 
Ancient Fifth and stepped off. 
With a wave of her hand, and then 
the most startling process to be 
found in a woman, Gloria Hanford 
poked two fingers in her mouth 
and let go with a shrill, piercing 
whistle that made every skycab 
driver within a half mile come to 
the point of ‘customer’s alert!’ 

She made her point. 

The one accessory that Junior 
Spaceman Howard Reed needed 
was a passenger, preferably a fe- 
male passenger that could be iden- 
tified as a female for a hundred 
yards through a high fog driven by 
a blinding gale. Old, beautiful, 
young or ugly didn’t matter, so long 
as it was unmistakably woman. The 
Military wouldn’t stop a skycab 
with a female passenger. 

He needed his passenger be- 
cause, until he could pull the taxi- 
meter flag — having filled the com- 
partment with a customer — he was 
constrained by law to cruise. Cruis- 
ing would get him nowhere; what 
he needed was the flag-down ticket 
of admission to the upper traffic 
levels. 

The whistle shrilled at him; he 
looked; and then with his space- 
man’s skill, Junior Spaceman How- 
ard Reed made a mad reverse 



spiral landing that nosed out a half 
dozen other cursing drivers. He hit 
ground zero at velocity zero on tar- 
get zero and flipped open the sky- 
cab door so close that Gloria Han- 
ford did not have to take a middle 
ground step to gain entry. 

He took off with a rush that 
tossed his passenger into the deep 
seat and slammed the compart- 
ment door without human effort 
Then he went into a cruel climbing 
turn that wore away twenty thou- 
sand flight miles of the engine bear- 
ings. He leveled off a thousand feet 
above Ancient Fifth Avenue’s top- 
most fast traffic level, and set his 
homing and warning beacon to 
zero on the spaceport. 

It did not bother him that his 
passenger hadn’t taken the time 
to supply him with the destination 
she desired. After all. Junior Space- 
man Howard Reed was not really 
a skycab driver. He didn’t care. 

Gloria Hanford rebounded from 
the soft cushions of the skycab 
compartment and struggled her 
way into a position that gave her 
a good look out of the broad rear 
window. Her driver’s mad upward 
spiral made her dizzy, but from the 
higher levels it was definitely ob- 
vious that there was considerable 
concentration of movement down 
there below. Men and ground cars 
as well as jetcopters were closing 
down upon the spot they’d just left. 

It did not bother Gloria Han- 
ford that her driver hadn’t waited 
GALAXY 



192 



to inquire as to her destination. 
She was just happy that he hadn’t. 
Her destination consisted of swift 
flight along any vector in a solid 
sphere; hers was a reverse destina- 
tion properly identified by the 
word “elsewhere.” 

T> EHIND them the city erupted 
with a criss-crossing of radio- 
directed searchbeams, catching and 
identifying skycar after skycar. Up 
from the city’s traffic levels came 
jetcopters and squad hoppers and 
some raid-gun carriers; personnel 
boats; even a sprinkling of mobile 
communications bases. To one side 
and almost behind them a flight of 
star shells burst in a fire-fall of 
gorgeous color. To their other side 
a stream of warning tracer streaked. 

Howard poured on the coal. 

Gloria made no protest; it was 
a most satisfactory agreement. 

They buzzed across the Jersey 
Flats. He brought the skycab down 
on a flat slant landing that arrowed 
directly in and touched ground and 
skidded to a stop with all landing- 
gear brakes locked. They slid to 
within a few yards of the space- 
craft. 

Only then did the junior space- 
man pause to speak to his passen- 
ger: “Sorry, but I’m in a jam. So 
long!” 

He leaped out of the skycab, 
raced along the ground, went up 
the ladder on a dead run, flipped 
into the spacelock, snapped the 
THE TROUBLEMAKERS 



“Close” switch as he passed the 
inner portal — and then, without 
waiting for any pre-flight checkout. 
Junior Spaceman Howard Reed re- 
signed from the Space Force by 
slamming his controls into an emer- 
gency and unauthorized flight pro- 
gram that took him up and out of 
Earth’s atmosphere in barely more 
than nothing flat 

When he was free and clear, he 
relaxed in his pilot’s seat, swiveled 
it around . and boggled, bug-eyed, 
at his passenger. 

Gloria Hanford, still trim and 
shipshape in her white sharkskin 
suit, still carrying the overnight bag 
in her formal-for-travelling, white- 
gloved hand, sat in the spare seat 
She said; “I’m sorry about this, 
too, but it so happens that I’m also 
in a jam. Where do we go from 
here, Spaceman?” 

He eyed her. ‘Where do you 
want to go?” 

Gloria chuckled in a throaty 
voice. “Away,” she said. 

“Can you cook?” he demanded 
abruptly. 

“Yes - why?” 

“Then go rustle up some grub 
from the galley,” he directed. “I’ll 
have to keep an eye on this crate 
until we’re free and clear. We can 
decide what to do next after we 
have time to think.” 

She looked at him strangely. Her 
own attitude puzzled her. It was 
the first time she’d been given an 
order that she hadn’t resented, but 

193 



then of course his direction made 
very good sense. 

He looked upon her as she rose 
— and he found her fair. 

She was. Gloria Hanford was an • 
extremely attractive dish in her 
own right. Amplified a few million- 
fold by the spaceman’s enforced 
isolation on Eden, Tau Ceti, and 
later upon Flatbush, Lalande 
25372, she was a dream. Either lo- 
cale would have the result of mak- 
ing Medusa the Gorgon look like 
Miss Universe of All Time, but 
Gloria Hanford didn’t need any 
handicaps. 

By some strange chemistry of 
non-material radiation that re- 
quired no catalyst, there was no 
question between them. 

Oh, they had a lot to find out 
about one another, but they had 
plenty of time for that. 

That and other things . 

XII 

TN the Officers’ Club on Earth, 
someone said, “What’s the lat- 
est report?” 

Commander Breckenridge of 
Operations said, “Last detected by 
the station at Last Gasp, Ross 780, 
and going like hell wouldn’t have 
them.” 

Commander Hughes of the Bu- 



reau of Justice said, “They^re go- 
ing at it rather early, aren’t they?” 

Scholar Ross of the Department 
of Domestic Tranquility waved at 
his comparison microscope and its 
data cards. “It would be hard to 
find two people better suited to 
one another.” He looked at his 
watch and smiled. “I’d say that by 
now they’ve both forgotten com- 
pletely that they were ever 
strangers.” 

Commander Briggs of the Bu- 
reau of Research refilled the glasses 
with the finest nonsynthetic vint- 
age champagne that the cellar of 
the Officers’ Club could provide. 
He held his glass high and said, “I 
toast the bride and groom and the 
ultimate colonization of the Galaxy 

— by subterfuge!” 

But Scholar Ross pulled the 
hand down. With a shake of his 
head, he held his own glass high. 
“Sorry, Briggs. But this time we 
toast the reactionaries, the die- 
hards and the rule-ridden old 
guard who have to work like the 
very devil to pair off a deserving 
young couple, and then force them 
into finding a home of their own 

— on some other planet. 

“Gentlemen. To the Trouble- 
makers! 

“Ourselves!”
