Lester 

Del Rey picks the best 

1971 



This inaugural volume of a new annual 
series includes fifteen stories selected by 
Lester Del Rey as the best published in 
magazines or original books during 1971. 

“There are few people who are first- 
class science fiction writers themselves 
and first-class judges of the quality of 
the science fiction other writers pro- 
duce. Of these douhle-threats Lester 
Del Rey is one of the most outstand- 
ing. When he says, 'These are the best,' 
I listen and I read and I enjoy. This 
book is the proof."

STRATEGY & TACTICS is a magazine. It’s 
also a tool; a time machine that enables you 
to replay the crucial events — past, present, 
and future — that shape our lives. 

Now, instead of merely reading about what's 
happening, you can explore and experience 
the alternatives and decision points through 
the technique of Conflict Simulation. 

What is Conflict Siimiiation? 

Conflict Simulation is a way of analyzing a 
political or military conflict situation. A’ way 
that is as intellectually stimulating as a game 
of chess, and as thorough as a written analysis. 

Through the use of the Conflict Simulation 
(or "game") format, the conflict situation is 
re-created — so that you are in a position to 
make the vital decisions and, in the game at 
least, change the way things were, are, or 
will be. 

What you got 

STRATEGY & TACTICS magazine is publish- 
ed bi-monthly. Each issue contains: 

A’ A ready-to-play conflict-simulation game 
with a 22 X 28 ' playing surface, die-cut play- 



ing pieces, and complete rules. 

A An analytical article on the same subject as 
the game in that issue. 

A Other feature articles on historical and 
military subjects. 

A Game and book reviews, commentary on 
existing games, and discussions of subscribers' 
questions. 

The magazine is 48 + pages long, and all 
material is handled in a highly organized (and 
easily understandable) graphic format. 

Games recently published in STRATEGY & 
TACTICS were: GRUNT (ground combat in 
Vietnam), LOST BATTLES (tactical combat in 
Russia, 1941-44), USN (the war in the Pacific, 
1941-43), COMBAT COMMAND (tactical com- 
bat in Western Europe, 1944). 

We also publish a separate line of conflict- 
simulation games, which you will find listed in 
the coupon.

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

I just finished reading Patterns of 
Chaos {Colin Kapp) last night and it 
thrilled me so much that I felt I must 
write and congratulate. The last novel 
you published that took me equally 
was I Will Fear No Evil (Robert A. 
Heinlein). I also enjoyed Dark Inferno 
and The Gods Themselves. 

Td like to comment on some recent 
trends in science fiction. Now that man 
has been to the moon I no longer find 
near-space science fiction too specula- 
tive. Voyages beyond the solar system, 
even beyond the galaxy, based on what 
we know, remain exciting. Also the 
concept of social science fiction is 
growing in importance as it begins 
to answer many questions that need 
answering. 

I had my doubts when your maga- 
zines changed ownership and editors in 
’69, but now / confess you’ve made the 
Galaxy/ If combo a treat to receive 
each month. 

Roy J. Schenck 
Canisteo, N. Y. 



the title of the story or even the author. 
But I’ll never forget the plot. 

Let me tell it briefly against the 
possibility that you or one of your 
readers might remember. A starship 
leaves Earth — purpose of the voyage is 
exploration. 

The ship is a mile long, carries 
hundreds of experts. 

Several generations pass and the 
ship is not heard from. Earth has 
developed more efficient space drives 
—her ships range the galaxy and one 
comes on the lost ship. 

The lost explorer had reached far out, 
lost its power source. It had, however, 
a ’’space anchor.” For generations 
the people on board have been locking 
the anchor in space at one end of a 
track running the length of the ship. 
Working in massive shifts, the people 
on board ’’walk” the ship forward 
past its mooring, release and reset the 
anchor forward, begin again — 
literally walking the ship home a few 
miles a day. A religion has grown 
out of this activity. 

Would-be rescuers discover that it 
would destroy these people to be told 
their faith and efforts were unneces- 
sary and they’re left to finish the 
journey on their own. 

The plot is distinctive and I hope 
the story hasn’t just faded into the 
past. I would like to find a copy.

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

There is a science-fiction story I’m 
trying to relocate. I read it a number of 
years ago in one of the better maga- 
zines — can’t remember which one or 



The story’s one 1 regret to have 
missed. Can anybody out there lend 
a hand?

ROM first orbit it had made 
itself conspicuous, looming 
high above the loftiest of the long 
chain of rugged peaks that made 
a backbone for the planet. And 
when Cap’n Jules Griffin brought 
in the Stardust, easing down 
through layers of clouds toward 
magnificent sweeps of sunlit terrain 
below, that summit was a natural 
focus for our curiosity. 



tellow while we re in the neighbor- 
hood,” I suggested. “Let Pegleg 
have a ball. I’m no expert at 
measuring, but that ought to make 
Everest look like a medium-sized 
molehill.” 

“Better than forty thousand 
feet,” Pegleg Williams announced. 
He had, I knew, been eyeing the 
big peak from the time we began 
visual reconnaissance. He adjusted 
his triangulation glasses. “This 




one breaks my record by thou- 
sands. Mount Rasmussen on 
Primrose Four was thirty-four 
seven, as you recall. Named it for 
Johnny because he’s top man and 
1 doubted that I’d ever see a higher 
one. Sorry, Johnny.” 

Dr. Johannes Rasmussen didn’t 
seem particularly upset. But then, 
he never did. He leaned back in the 
Director’s chair, long, thin and 
immaculate as always. He looked 
as though he had shaved within the 
hour. His mustaches were waxed 
to points. But his eyes twinkled 
behind his reserved, still face. 

“Your intentions were good. Dr. 
Williams,” he said. “More 1 
cbuldn’t ask. I’m quite content 
with Mount Rasmussen on Prim- 
rose Four. I’ll certainly not take its 
picture down from my office wall 
because we’ve discovered a higher 
peak. I am many things, but, I 
hope, not fickle.” 

Usually formal and grave, oc- 
casionally Johnny would fool you. 
No man crossed him when he said 
things for sure and many of the 
crew never found him other than 
cerebral and remote. But in the 
control room of the explorer ship 
Stardust we were men who knew 
each other well. We were all a part 
of what would be the legend of the 
Stardust — had been from the 
beginning. 

Moe Cheng sat quietly in the 
navigator’s seat. For the moment 
his responsibilities were over. He 
had guided us across trackless 



space, stage after Ultraspan stage, 
until the little yellow dot that the 
space charts called Olympus had 
become a brilliant golden sun. 
Probably only Moe Cheng could 
have done it. Certainly no one has 
ever known as much about the 
galaxy as this big-nosed, slant- 
eyed little man. 

The big peaks of Olympus’s sec- 
ond planet turned beneath us as 
Cap’n Jules swept the ship in a vast 
circle around the mighty jumble of 
crags and pinnacles that made up 
the most impressive uplift any of 
us had ever seen.> Great glaciers 
flowed down its shoulders. Below 
them green and gray sweeps of 
tundra merged with dark forests 
crowding up from the valleys and 
foothills. It was an Earthlike 
scene, but in giant scale. 1 thought 
of the Himalayas, the Andes, the 
Icefield Ranges of the St. Elias. It 
was all of them and more. Much, 
much more. 

T he true peak, the pinnacle of 
pinnacles, was hidden from us. 
Clouds swirled in slow circles and 
the summit was lost in them. The 
presence of that much moisture so 
high augured well for the condi- 
tion of the atmosphere. Unless, 
below, it was a world of heavy, 
humid, unbreathable air. 1 can 
say only that from our point of 
vantage it didn’t look it. 

“Now i see,” Pegleg said, “why 
this system was called Olympus. 
That’s Mount Olympus out there. 



8 



IF 




The genuine article. Couldn’t have 
named that peak after you anyhow, 
Johnny. It already has a name.” 
“Only one drawback,” i agreed. 
“Until this moment nobody knew 
it was here — unless, maybe, Ursula 
has already had some input. She’s 
probably been in communication 
with Apollo by now.” 

“Zeus,” Pegleg corrected firmly. 
“Ursula doesn’t deal with under- 
lings. She’d contact the top man.” 

If you’re beginning to suspect 
that we were not entirely serious 
you’re catching on. It’s the way we 
operate. Behind the swirling mists 
of our whimsical dialogue the 
solid structure of our real thinking 
lay in orderly and efficient pat- 
terns. As I watched I was auto- 
matically separating the impressive 
terrain into ecosystems, subcon- 
sciously groping for the best study 
plan. Ecology is my competence. 
And I knew that Pegleg, galactic 
geologist extraordinary, by now 
was analyzing the uplift with ex- 
perience gained on many planets, 
using it to structure an insight into 
the history of this world that would 
be as valid as anything our instru- 
ments could tell us. 

The same procedures were going 
on all over the ship. Experts in 
many fields had activate their 
expertise. Dr. James Peters, chief 
zoologist, would be mentally 
organizing his exploring and col- 
lecting teams, speculating on what 
the habitats in view might contain 
and yield. Dr. Winifred Hcffel- 



finger,^ Winkle to a few of us and- 
my choice of all the botanists who 
ever swung a field pick, would be 
readying her vascuta and presses 
and drooling over the collecting 
possibilities in the varied world 
below. To Winkie no object was 
more beautifuf than the bleached 
and desiccated carcass of a plant 
on an herbarium sheet, a defend- 
able name in impeccable Latin 
attached. To each his own. She’s 
still one of my favorite people. 

I could list them all, meteorolo- 
gists, limnologists. oceanographers, 
radiation specialists, communica- 
tions experts, language enthusiasts, 
archeologists— just know that they 
were all aboard. None better ex- 
isted in their various fields and in 
addition each had the unique per- 
sonal stability that our strange 
profession requires. Earth was thei^ 
birthplace, but space was their 
home. And would always be. 

We’ve mentioned Ursula Potts. 
Even aboard the Stardust Ursula 
was different. Little; wizened, old, 
with strange pale eyes and a big 
bun of gray hair on the back of her 
head usually thrust full of paint 
brushes, Ursula looked more like 
a galactic hitchhiker than a valued 
member of the Stardust team. 
Ursula painted. And somehow 
those paintings revealed what our 
most intricate equipment did not 
detect. Johnny Rasmussen treated 
them with the same respect he 
gave to the most profound field 
report. And rightly so. With un- 



GODS ON OLYMPUS 



9 




canny perception they pulled 
together and gave more meaning 
to the results of a look-see. 

THE Stardust swung lower 
around the great peak, we 
knew that Ursula had already 
extruded her transparent bubble 
of a studio. Seen from afar, it 
jutted from the ship's featureless 
hide like a pale parasite. And 
there, in radiatron-shielded com- 
fort, Ursula’s magic brushes were 
seeing the mountain a little dif- 
ferently, a little more concisely 
than even the technical perfection 
of the endlessly clicking recording 
cameras. 

“Wish those clouds would blow 
off a little,” I said. “I sort of 
hanker to see what the pinnacle 
looks like. And we could get an 
accurate measurement.” 

“They can’t blow away, Roscoe,” 
Pegleg said. “You know that. 
That’s where the gods live.” 
“You’re milking a gag,” I re- 
torted. “Couldn’t we use a dis- 
sipator, Johnny, and get a look at 
the summit while we’re close?” 
“I’ve been watching. Dr. Kis- 
singer,” Johnny Rasmussen said 
gravely. “Look carefully at those 
mists. Are they moving as clouds 
normally move on a mountaintop? 
You have experience in these 
things.” 

Trust Johnny. Nothing gets past 
him. I should have noticed the 
difference myself. The clouds 
swathing Mount Olumpus were 



moving in a tight spiral, a steady 
whirlwind flow, counterclockwise. 
Air currents just don’t behave like 
that. And as we watched the motion 
grew less, the streaming clouds 
stabilized into huge fluffy masses, 
and then slowly reversed the flow. 

I knew Pegleg was as surprised 
as any of us, but his narrow face 
was tranquil. “You see?” he asked. 
No one /came up with a good 
answer. The clouds speeded up the 
clockwise spiral, spread into bands 
and the bands were moving at dif- 
ferent rates. The phenomenon 
wasn’t all that obvious and the 
casual observer might not even 
have been aware — but there it was. 

I saw Jules Griffin lean forward! 
in his chair and press a small blue 
button. Nothing seemed to hap- 
pen, but we all felt easier. The 
Stardust now moved behind an 
incredible shield of energy turned 
in on itself, a forcefield that would 
repel any power we could envision. 
It was almost ultimate protection. 
If old Zeus had chosen to hurl his 
thunderbolts out of those peculiar 
clouds three would have got you 
twenty that they would have 
bounced off us. 

We made one more hiihdred- 
mile swing around the giant peak. 
From all over the ship sensors 
were focused on it, photographing, 
listening, probing, analyzing. Data 
piled up. When it was all put 
together, collated and organized, 
we would know about that moun- 
tain. Or so we thought. 



10 



IF 




T he five of us in the control 
room structured the drop-in, 
as always. If, by rare and tragic 
chance, Johnny Rasmussen 
should ever become unable to 
command the Stardust any one of 
the other four could take over. It 
had never happened. We didn't 
think it ever would. But we rep- 
resented the foresight that made 
Johnny what he was. He had back- 
ups for everything, even himself. 

We had been in orbit — swinging 
three thousand miles above the 
planet’s surface — for the past five 
hours, verifying the life picture. The 
Stardust's function is the discovery 
and investigation of living worlds. 
We’re getting good at it. 

We know by now the properties 
of the suns most likely to encour- 
age life on their satellites. And by 
that I mean life as we know it. 
We’re aware of the possibilities of 
other- types of life, with unknown 
chemical affinities and interactions, 
but they’re not our concern. 
Curiosity has to stop somewhere. 
Good, carbon-centered, oxygen- 
respiring entities are scattered 
through the galaxy on a myriad 
worlds. We know that now. We’re 
finding them ever more consis- 
tently. And our orderly, patterned 
coverage and procedure will 
provide a template for the plan- 
ning of the inevitably wiser, more 
learned explorers who will follow 
us. But this is our heyday, our 
zenith. As I write these reports 
there are none like us anywhere. 



''I think, gentlemen, that this 
alters our landing plans some- 
what.” 

Johnny Rasmussen had punched 
for a brandy from the console by 
his chair. His long fingers lovingly 
and gently twirled the small goblet. 
That meant he was thinking. 

“Come now, Johnny, we can’t 
be bluffed by a cloud.” Pegleg 
sounded outraged. I knew the 
mountain fascinated him. 

The chiefs teeth showed briefly 
beneath his neat mustache. 

“You misunderstand. Dr. Wil- 
liams. I propose a closer landing 
that the one agreed on. If the cloud 
hides what we ought to know — 
perhaps it would be handy to 
establish base nearby.” 

“I accept your apology for not 
being x:lear,” Pegleg said gravely. 
“How close is closer?” 

Johnny raised an eyebrow. Like 
all of us he lives with Pegleg’s sour 
personality, laced through with sly, 
completely irreverent humor. 

“Dr. Kissinger’s advice would 
be helpful here. You’re a high- 
country man, Roscoe. Would it 
be feasible to establish base above 
timberline — say on one of the long 
tundra slopes that fan out below the 
glaciers? There seem to be several 
good-looking possibilities.” 

“Not only feasible but desir- 
able,” I said promptly. We were all 
studying the slowly turning pano- 
rama below us on our viewscreens. 
“We’ll be high enough to have 
every type of terrain in view — at 



GODS ON OLYMPUS 



11 




much better perspective than at the 
lakeside we had in mind. And 
Mount Olympus and its cloud 
would be right in the front yard.” 
“Pretty high altitude for the 
casual hiker, though,” Pegl^ 
reminded us. “Say fourteen to fif- 
teen thousand feet above mean sea 
level. Nose-bleed country for the 
average citizen. I’ve got a feeling 
that people won’t want to do their 
off-duty strolling in oxygen masks.” 
“Won’t be necessary,” I said. 
“You’re thinking Earth again. 
This is Olympus Two, remember. 
The planet is bigger, the at- 
mosphere much thicker. I haven’t 
checked the data, but I’ll guess 
that three miles up will not be far 
off Earth sea-level normal. Sea 
level here would be dense, muggy, 
oxygen-rich. Uh-uh. We’ll all be 
happier up there.” 

“I’ll join you,” Pegleg said 
humbly. “My thinking was no 
clearer than Johnny’s communi- 
cating. I vote for the tundra.” 

“Mr. Cheng?” 

“Very reasonable. 1 am in 
favor.” 

“Captain Griffin?” 

Cap’n Jules said nothing. He 
regards conversation as a waste of 
time and when he does speak he 
never fascinates anybody. A duller 
man never drew breath — conversa- 
tionally, that is. But the mighty 
timonium engines that drive the 
Stardust in finite space wag their 
tails at the slightest touch of his 
blunt fingers and he is one of the 



•very few man alive who can imple- 
ment Ultraspan. Now he simply 
raised his right hand, joined the 
thumb and index finger. 

II 

W E PUT our heads together, 
picked our stretch of rolling 
high-country meadow and Cap’n 
Jules guided the Stardust in, her 
fifteen hundred feet of glistening 
bulk gliding to a full-length landing 
as gracefully as a bit of thistledown 
drifting down a sunbeam. No sav- 
age outpourings of braking energy. 
No shuddering, jarring loss of 
acceleration. These things are only 
history now. The great ship’s 
thousands of tons of mass were 
completely nullified by her new 
timonium antigravs. We experi- 
enced no sense of landing at all. 
We simply ceased to move. And 
around us the tundra swept away, 
gray and brown and red and yellow 
with lichens, bright with wide 
stretches of short-stemmed high- 
country flowers. 

Johnny Rasmussen murmured 
into a microphone. Shortly the 
ship’s intercom came alive, 

rumbled and cleared its throat. 
Stony Price, communications 

chief, always read the landing 
communique. 

“The Stardust has landed. Olym- 
pus Two awaits us. Whether or 
not it’s with open arms or an open 
mouth remains to be seen. All data 
indicate a compatible world, but 



12 



IF 




final checks remain to be made. 
Dr. Rasmussen suggests that ten- 
tative reconnaissance patterns be 
adjusted to our present location, 
fifteen thousand two hundred feet 
above mean sea level. There ;are 
reasons for this. Don’t blame me. 
You’ll be notified when checks are 
completed. Meanwhile feast . your 
eyes on Mount Olympus.” 

“Open mouth,” Pegleg growled. 
“Stony’s the one with the open 
mouth.”' 

“You do hate competition^” I 
said. “Look at your viewscreen 
and be glad. There are more rocks 
out there than we’ve found for you 
in the last five landings. Count 
your blessings. Take what the 
gods provide.” 

“Oh, I’m humbly grateful,” 
Pegleg said. He eyed the view- 
screen, then looked quizzically at 
me. “As for the gods — I see no 
reason why we shouldn’t thank 
them personally since we’re going 
to live next door.” 

Once Pegleg gets an idea he 
worries it. And inevitably I am 
involved. Since we’re both essen- 
tially field men and our areas of 
concern overlap we usually work 
together. Always have. With many 
people a little of Pegleg goes a long 
way, but we complement each other 
neatly. I’ve loosened up a lot of 
tight places for him and there have 
been times when I’ve been mighty 
grateful to be backed up by the cold 
nerve and lancing laser of Pegleg 
Williams.

Successful drop-in completed, we 
left Control to Cap’n Jules, who 
sat as stolidly as a stone man in his 
master’s chair. I’ve often wondered 
what he thinks about as he sits like 
that, white head erect, pale eyes 
vacant. But the results are good. 
As long as we have Cap’n Juljes 
and Moe Cheng, logistics will never 
be a worry. 

P EGLEG and I strolled the 
corridor complex, headed for 
our respective labs. A door opened 
and the most beautiful woman I 
have ever seen came through. Tall, 
graceful, with a magnificent figure, 
fine, clean-planed features, live 
green eyes and red curls tumbling 
to her shoulders — in the galaxy 
there couldn’t be another like her. 
I reached out an arm, pulled her 
to me and gave her the kind of kiss 
a man should give to a woman like 
that. Or as near as I could manage. 
She clung to me for a moment, 
then slowly pushed my arms away. 
Her green eyes danced. 

“Roscoe,” she said. “What will 
the neighbors say?’’ 

“Disgusting,’’ said Pegleg. 

I’ve been married to her for nine 
Earth years. They seem like nine 
weeks. Ultraspan stages into the 
depths of the galaxy, to nerve- 
grinding episodes on strange 
worlds — these are only the 

commonplace occurrences of day- 
to-day living as long as I have 
Lindy. With her, anywhere in the 
universe is home. 



She’s not just Mrs. Kissinger. 
Dr. Linda Peterson was the first 
and is the only, microbiologist the 
Stardust has ever had. No one can 
approach her knowledge of galactic 
microforms. And no foot is placed 
on a new world until Lindy’s report 
is in Johnny’s hands and he has 
analyzed it carefully. The Stardust 
could not do without her any more 
than 1 could. 

1 could tell by her relaxed smile 
that her sampling chores were 
already well in hand. And that the 
news was probably good. She 
strolled down the corridor with us, 
her fingers twined with mine. 

“Well,’’ said Pegleg, “don’t hold 
out. Any nasty little varmints in the 
air? Looks like a pretty good deal 
out there. Don’t spoil it if you can 
help it.’’ 

“The girls are running final 
checks,” Lindy said. “Give them 
another thirty minutes. At this 
altitude at least everything looks 
clear.” She looked from me to 
Pegleg. “Speaking of altitude, 
whose idea was it to set down half- 
way up a mountain range? I don’t 
suppose Roscoe’s love affair with 
tundras or your everlasting yen for 
base rocks had anything to do with 
it.” 

“No scientist jumps to con- 
clusions.” Pegleg oozed disdain. 
“You do. Johnny thought this up 
all by himself. We just agreed with 
him.” 

My wife turned to me. 

“I’m a simple person, so he

IF 




makes no sense to me. What gives, 
Roscoe?” 

I grinned and squeezed her 
fingers. 

“He’s reporting correctly. It was 
Johnny’s idea, all right. There’s 
something funny about the big 
peak out there and we want to take 
an extended look.’’ 

“Mount Olympus,’’ Pegleg ex- 
plained gravely. “The gods are 
holding high carnival behind those 
clouds on the summit. We want to 
crash the party.’’ 

Lindy looked amused. Whatever 
she is, she’s not a simple person. 

“Won’t that be a mite risky? I 
seem to remember that mortals in 
the past have never been the same 
after going up into those clouds.” 
“They didn’t have scoutboats or 
lasers. or dissipators,” Pegleg said. 
“1 think we can get a hearing. 
Never forget that everything we do 
is a first, anyhow.” 

“Oh, good,” Lindy said. “I’ve 
always wanted to interview Aphro- 
dite. For the benefit of the unin- 
formed among us, she is the 
goddess of love.” 

Pegleg looked outraged. “I 
know, I know.” 

“Maybe,” Lindy added reflec- 
tively, “I can find out what she’s 
got that I haven’t got.” 

“I can answer that,” I said. 
“Nothing.” 

Pegleg shrugged. 

“You should know,” he said. 
Now all this may sound sharp, 
brittle, even on the edge of silly 



to you. It wasn’t. Behind the non- 
sense good friends and co-workers 
were simply catching up on the 
news. It’s just that you probably 
don’t do it that way. 

I INDY and I were back in our 
^ quarters when finally the inter- 
com awoke again. 

“Dr. Rasmussen’s communique, 
official.” Stony Price reporting. 
We talk to Stony all the time, but 
we rarely see him. Usually he’s 
just a cheerful, irreverent voice. 
“Olympus Two is compatible. 
Atmosphere at this altitude com- 
parable to Earth sea-level normal. 
Life varied, but no evidence of 
thinking forms. Usual precautions 
against unknown aggressive or 
predacious entities. Seventy-two 
hours free reconnaissance, at the 
end of which time all major re- 
search heads will meet to structure 
the survey pattern. Whew!” Stony 
heaved a sigh. “All those big words. 
That is all.” 

We had anticipated the procedure 
and were ready. As usual, my first 
reconnaissance would be simple. 
1 would go out, take a good leg- 
stretching hike across that inviting 
tundra, adjust to the gravity, get 
used to the feel of alien air in my 
lungs. I would find an elevation that 
would give me the widest, most 
sweeping view and I would sit there, 
looking, orienting, soaking up this 
spectacular environment. And I 
would have a good feeling that such 
sights could be seen, probably in 



GODSON OLYMPUS

infinite variety, on many favored 
worlds throughout the galaxy, 

I would know a twinge of 
sadness, too, that on Earth they 
had almost disappeared. 

The personnel ports were acti- 
vated and we went out past the 
guards onto the lichen-sheathed 
high plains that stretched away in 
all directions. Lindy was with me. 
She comes when she can. And after 
a series of Ultraspan stages every- 
one was eager for the feel of the 
substrate, of the solid planet that 
is, after all, our normal abode. 

We didn’t bounce about. Gravity 
was somewhat greater than Earth 
normal and our feet felt heavy. We 
plodded along. Our lungs expanded 
with the good, oxygen-rich air. 
After a mile I was on my toes 
again. I’ve stretched my legs on a 
number of worlds. This one was 
superior, more majestic, than most. 

^‘Do you think,” Lindy panted, 
“that if 1 keep this up it will make 
a woman of me? Ease up, Roscoe. 
Don’t forget, I’m one of God’s 
gentler creatures.” 

We finally stood on a high, 
round-topped knoll finished off 
with with scattered, smooth-worn 
boulders. I boosted Lindy to a 
comfortable seat. The world lay 
beneath us for miles. But great 
peaks towered high beyond the 
lowlands and over them all rose 
the vast massif of Mount Olympus, 
its upper reaches swathed in those 
strange clouds. It was beautiful and 
mind-stretching. 



O UR field glasses swept a wide 
panorama. Beside the glinting, 
featureless cylinder of the Stardust 
people moved like ants, spreading 
out oyer the terrain. Portals 
yawned as we watched and three 
scoutboats were spat from them 
like torpedoes. Probably meteorol- 
ogists, geographers, mapping ex- 
perts. Few people were actually 
doing much work. It was orien- 
tation time. 

Perhaps ten miles away a darting, 
zig-zagging speck was resolved by 
the glasses into Pegleg’s jeep, 
obviously headed for a spectacular 
red wall that reared beyond. 

A tiny red dot out on a slope 
beyond the ship was Ursula Potts’ 
red umbrella. On compatible 
worlds she forsakes her little studio 
and paints in the open, always 
shielded by that spot of color. We 
knew that her easel was up, her 
paraphernalia strewn about her and 
that she had begun a program that 
would occupy her every waking 
hour until lift-off. 

“Pff to the right, up high, coming 
down the wind, Roscoe — ” Lindy’s 
restless binoculars had picked up 
the first motile life. I swung up my 
own glasses. 

“Typical,” I said. “Big country, 
big Hying predator. Something to 
feed on whatever in turn eats the 
tundra vegetation. Could be a 
variety of plant eaters around— 
they’re probably hiding because so 
many of us are out.” 

More of the soaring raptores 



16 



IF 




appeared. In the shifting air 
currents and thermal chimneys 
of a bright afternoon they swung 
and glided high against the slopes 
of the peaks. None came close. We 
knew they were watching tbis 
strange invasion with the telescopic 
eyes such forms always have. 

That evolution here had proceded 
along Earthlike lines was less 
surprising to us than it would have 
been some years before. Although 
much of the life we have found has^ 
been unpredictably different, some 
patterns seem to recur again and 
again. 

spent an hour on our knoll, 
no one else near. We sat quietly 
and gradually small life came out 
all around us. Small rodentlike 
forms peered from rock piles and 
darted hastily from place to place 
through the bright tundra blow- 
ers. Minute insectlike creatures 
swar^ned. And what appeared to 
be a red dragonfly, three or four 
inches in wingspan, crouched on 
rocks with spread wings and 
twitching eyes or coursed low back 
and forth over the tundra, feeding. 

Ever and anon we transferred our 
attention to the big peak, to Mount 
Olympus. Its cloud-shrouded sum- 
mit seemed to thrust through the 
sky above us. The highest “eagle” 
our glasses could show still soared 
far below those clouds. 

F rom the first 1 never had 
much doubt that those clouds 
were being manipulated. And that 



meant that this was not the primi- 
tive world it seemed. There was a 
technology here, perhaps elaborate, 
and a superior race or races of 
living things. I wasn’t sure whether 
I was sorry or glad. I enjoy the 
contacts with alien minds — but I 
love the primitive worlds, too. The 
earlier stages in the evolutionary 
sequence are my special concern. 
It is here, before any form has 
become aware, that ecosystems are 
most perfect. Their checks and 
balances operate with beautiful 
efficiency, an inevitability that 
enables populations to vary, to 
adjust, to progress. Here the 
pattern of evolution is most clear. 

“Pegleg will be disappointed,” 
Lindy remarked as we strolled 
slowly back toward the ship. 

“A common occurrence,” I said, 
“but why this time? This looks like 
the place where geologists go when 
they die. What more could he 
possibly want?” 

Lindy giggled. When another 
woman makes a sound like that 
you think it’s silly. But any sound 
she makes is a part of Lindy. 

“He meant exactly what he said 
when he spoke of crashing Zeus’s 
party. He intended to take a scout, 
use a dissipator on those clouds and 
expose the whole enigma to the 
public gaze. Now I imagine that 
Johnny will rule that he Can’t do 
it.” 

I saw her point. 

“ISC ruling. No interference 
with the organization or the activi- 



GODSON OLYMPUS 



17 




ties of aware forms. He’ll have to 
prove that the swirling clouds are 
simply meteorological oddities, or 
agree that intellects are operating 
them. In which case he can only 
be a spectator. Pegl^ hates that.” 
I turned back for another look at 
the Olympian nightcap and it was 
well I did. Things were happening. 

The characteristic rotation of the 
cloud mass had slowed to a crawl. 
I thought for a moment that it was 
beginning to break up, but matters 
were not that simple. Fleecy puffs 
were blowing out from the bands, 
floating gently for a few minutes, 
then slowly dissipating. There were 
dozens of them. They seemed 
random, but by now I knew that 
wasn’t likely. 

“Patterned,” Lindy said. “Mean- 
ingful to somebody — or something. 
Could be anything from a calling 
up of the Home Guard to a call 
to prayer. I’U guess that it won’t 
last long.” 

It didn’t. After a few minutes 
the cloud mass had speeded up 
again and no longer gave off the 
puffs. 

“End of message,” 1 said. 
“Thirty. Over and out. Now all we 
have to do is to figure out whether 
or not we were the reasons for that. 
As if we didn’t know.” 

“Likely,” Lindy agreed. “Still, 
the mechanism was operating 
before we got here. That may 
happen every day at this time. 

“Remotely controlled?” 1 sug- 
gested. “It would not be too prob- 



able that living things are actually 
up there. And if that’s so, then 
somewhere we’ve got concentra- 
tions of intelligent life. I’m 
beginning to be challenged.” 

“You may not like them,” Lindy 
warned. “We’re butting in as 
usual. They would be justified in 
resenting us. Sometimes we do 
forget that.” 

“Still,” I decided, “I’m favor- 
ably disposed so far. They keep a 
nice place here. Haven’t messed 
it up. Air’s good, water’s pure, no 
unsightly artifacts. Smart people.” 
Lindy’s beautiful face reflected 
tolerant amusement. That’s one 
of her secrets. She lets me know she 
appreciates me, no matter how 
corny I get. 

“You’re chopping up your 
sentences like Ursula,” she said. 

We both glanced down the long 
slope to the little red dot on the 
tundra. I’m sure we both had the 
same idea at the same time. 

“Speaking of whom,” 1 said, 
“why don’t we go down and see? 
She’ll have an idea. Always does.” 
“Stop it,” Lindy ordered. “One 
person on the Stardust who talks 
like that is enough.” 

N ot many people dare inter- 
rupt Ursula at work. She 
paints with a fierce concentration, 
seeing. I’m sure, not only what is 
before her, but meanings hidden 
from less sensitive mortals. And 
those meanings, too, appear in the 
sometimes strange, always com- 



18 



IF 




pelting [^oducts of her art. This 
uncanny second sight, plus Ursula’s 
abrupt impatience with pedantry, 
has given rise to the witch rumor. 
But we are enlightened people. We 
know witches never existed — 1 
think. 

We knew she saw and heard us 
approach, but she gave no sign. 
'She simply painted. Her fingers 
unerringly selected the brush she 
wanted from tlve collection- thrust 
handle-end first through the big 
bun on the back of her head. When 
she finished with the brush she 
thrust it back in at any angle. 
The loose sleeves of the old sweater 
she always wore, inside or out, hot 
planet or cold, flopped with her 
crisp, sure strokes. The easel was 
in sunlight. Ursula sat on her 
campstool just under the shadow 
of the big red umbrella. 

We watched for a few minutes, 
a practically unpardonable sin 
for most people. But we’re special. 
Ursula had been with us, Lindy 
and Pegleg and me, at Armageddon 
on Cyrene IV. She knows that 
we know the lonely old woman 
behind that acid tongue and the 
strange pale eyes. She knows we’re 
fond of her. 

Suddenly she decided to recog- 
nize our existence. She thrust the 
brush into her hair with finality 
and spun on her stool. 

“Out of a job, eh? A whole 
planet — and nothing to do?” 

“You know better than that, 
Ursula,” I said. “I’m always 



working. Up here.” And I tapped 
my forehead. 

Ursula actually grinned. 

“Hard to prove.” She made a 
sweeping gesture that included half 
the great mountain range. “What 
do you think, Roscoe?” 

“Good country,” I^ said tenta- 
tively. “A variety of life forms, 
but probably no thinking beings. 
Pretty typical tundra, but on a 
grand scale, 1 like.” 

Ursula sniffed. 

“Dodging the problems. What 
makes the clouds go around?” 
“Give me time,” 1 protested. 
We’ve only been here three hours. 
Besides, 1 thought you’d know.” 
“More complex than it looks.” 
Ursula narrowed her strange eyes. 
“Feel more than we see. All I 
know — so far.” She indicated the 
painting on the easel. 

She hadn’t even painted the big 
mountain. The canvas showed 
simply a stretch of tundra. Some- 
times her paintings are vague, im- 
pressionistic, expressing mood 
rather than the actual substance 
of her subject. But this picture 
was not like thaf. It was s[^cific, 
almost photographically detailed. 
Even the several kinds of lichens 
were easily distinguished. Three 
different small rodents peered 
from behind rocks. We had seen 
each of them up the slope. On a 
rock a red dragonfly sat, complete 
to the greenish iridescence of its 
huge eyes. 

In the upper corner of the paint- 



GODS ON OLYMPUS 



19 




ing, against the sky, soared one 
of the wide-winged eagles. Every 
fldwer was recognizable. My eyes 
pick up and my brain records such 
details automatically. There was 
only one creature on the canvas 
that I didn’t recognize. Lindy 
pointed it out. 

“He’s cute,” she said. “Just 
Hke a coon, Roscoe.” 

It really was. It was in the middle 
distance in the scene and only 
partially in sight, as though it 
peered over a little roll in the 
terrain. It didn’t have a raccoon’s 
mask, but the ears, the pointed 
muzzle, the alert black eyes, all 
reminded us of the little Earth 
mammal. In fact, Ursula’s genius 
really showed in those bright eyes. 
They had a knowing look. The two 
forelimbs were visible. They ended 
in a raccoon’s babylike hands. 

“We missed that fellow,” I said. 
“Where did you see him, Ursula?” 
“Didn’t,” Ursula said. 

“Then why is he there?” 

“Don’t know. Just seemed to 
belong there. Painted hinn in before 
I thought.” 

“That’s faking,” I said. 

“Doubt it. Scene doesn’t look 
right without him.” 

It had happened before. In fact, 
it happened all the time. Ursula 
doesh’t just see with her eyes. Call 
that eerie sixth sense what you 
will, Ursula has it. We had had 
enough experience, Lindy and I, 
to recognize what we were seeing. 
When we talked it over we agreed 



that, sooner or later, we would see 
that little animal in the flesh. 



AS IT happened, it was sooner. 

The following morning, in 
fact. And the creature was not 
out on the tundra. It was in a small 
cage brought in triumphantly by 
one of Jim Peters’ young trappers. 
Like all of us, Jim has his own 
reconnaissance methods. And the 
live trap is his mainstay. 

When we establish a wilderness 
base, as now, an area near the 
spaceship pretty quickly becomes 
a menagerie. The zoologists set 
up shelters against sun and wind 
and cagefuls of all kinds of crea- 
tures accumulate. The rest of us 
learn simply by visiting Jim’s zoo. 
Jim watches and analyzes and feeds 
while his teams of collectors range 
far and wide. By day and by night 
his strings and traps sample a 
region’s life. 

One of Jim’s most consistent 
visitors is always Lindy. 1 never 
saw the living thing she couldn’t 
make friends with. It’s a gift, as 
uncanny in its way as Ursula’s 
weird awareness. If there’s such 
a thing as an universal sociologist, 
Lindy qualifies. Everything trusts 
her. I don’t try to understand it. 
I’m simply proud. 

“There he is, Roscoe.” 

The plastip awnings and shelters 
were going up and the first rows 
of cages were being put into place. 
The coonlike creature sat in 



20 



IF 




its wire enclosure, seeming to 
watch everything with bright- 
eyed interest. 

Close-up, it was not as small 
as it had looked on Ursula's 
picture. 1 would have guessed it 
ran thirty, thirty-five pounds. 
Earth weight. On Olympus Two it 
was probably a bit. more. It looked 
us over thoroughly when we 
approached. It wasn’t frightened, 
but it was never still. Its sharp 
nose twitched. Its restless black 
hands clasped and unclasped. It 
continually touched itself all over 
its furry gray-and-black body, 
sometimes using only a single 
finger, sometimes both hands 
together. Even its brushy tail 
moved constantly, forming a 
series of patterns on the ground 
as it sat. 

“Busy little fellow, isn’t he?’’ 
My conversation was less than 
sparkling, but I felt I had to say 
something. 

“More than busy,” Lindy said 
gravely. “Purposeful. All that 
twitching isn’t just nervous temp- 
erament. There’s a functional 
reason for it.” 

“A good imagination is always 
helpful,” I said, but I studied the 
creature carefully just the same. 
It doesn’t do to discount Lindy’s 
serious comments. And after a few 
minutes I admitted: “He looks 
like a third*base coach going 
through his routine to give the 
batter his sign. Are you saying 
he’s trying to tell us something?” 



Lindy smiled. “I always knew all 
that baseball would come in 
handy in some remote future. 
That’s just what he looks like. 
Watch.” 

She went down on her shapely 
knees directly in front of the cage 
and began to make a series of 
random motions, holding up fin- 
gers, touching various parts of her 
body, shrugging, even winking in 
patterns." 

“You’re handicapped,” I pointed 
out. “You haven’t got a bushy tail.” 

“Quiet. Think positively. If a 
typewriter is missing a couple of 
letters, you can still read what 
it writes.” 

My wife was behaving like a 
charming idiot. She worked out a 
simple routine and went througli 
it again and again. And she was 
getting results. The coon was 
fascinated. He stopped his own 
motions entirely and when Lindy 
paused he made a swift gesture, 
then put both black hands over 
his eyes. 

“No savvy,” I said. “You’re 
talking nonsense. That’s plain as 
plain.” 

“Maybe,” Lindy said. “Let’s 
prove it.” 

When, after a moment, the coon 
went back to his endless touching 
and twitching, Lindy made his 
gesture and put her hands over 
her own eyes. It worked. The coon 
was baffled. That he recognized the 
signals was beyond doubt. And 
for the first time he simply sat

and stared at us steadily. We 
could almost see him think. 

I INDY rose to her feet, brushing 
^ the dust from her knees. 
“In a relatively brief time we 
have gathered some very signifi- 
cant data,'* she, said. “Summar- 
ize, please.” 

I grinned. It’s a game we play. 
“Item,” I began. “Pegleg 
definitely can’t dissipate the clouds 
on Mount Olympus, because they 
are aftificially produced by aware 
beings.” 

“Possible,” Lindy said, “but 
still not proved. You can do better 
than that.” 

“Item. Jim Peters has violated 
an International Space Council 
ruling by interfering with an 
aware species. At this very moment 
has one of its members incarcerated 
and in durance vile.” 

“Quite likely,” Lindy agreed. 
“So far no great harm has been 
done and he can be forgiven on 
grounds of ignorance. More?” 
“Item. Communication on this 
world is more visual than auditory, 
perhaps completely visual. And the 
cloud patterns on Mount Olympus 
and the monkey motions of this 
little varmint in the cage are both 
parts of an elaborate system of 
keeping up with the news around 
the world and the juicy doings of 
the neighbors. 

“Now— I’m proud of you,” 
Lindy said with satisfaction. 
“We’re probably oversimplifying. 



but I do believe we’ve got the key, 
Roscoe. Let’s go talk with Johnny.” 
We were on our way, but we only 
got to the edge of the shelter. Two 
of the young trappers were just 
arriving, each with a cage — and 
each cage held another coon. 

“Good hunting, pric,” I said. 
“Where are you catching these 
fellows? 1 haven’t even seen one 
free. What’s their habitat?” 

“No idea. Dr. Kissinger. We 
haven’t seen one either. These were 
in traps on the open tandra. No 
bait. They just walked in.” 
“Knowing full well what they 
were walking into, I bet. What 
better way to get into our setup 
without attracting the wrong kind 
of attention?” Lindy was obviously 
pleased with herself. ‘ 

The big blond zoologist was 
puzzled. 

“Coons are always curious. Dr. 
Peterson,” he explained. “They 
investigate. These little guys would 
naturally explore something new.’’ 
Lindy shook her red curls. 

“This isn’t Earth,” she pointed 
out, “and no matter what they look 
like, those aren’t coons. I’ll bet you 
a chocolate ice-cream soda they’re 
here because they want to be here.’' 
The men set down the cages. We 
all stood watching the composed, 
busy occupants. They were twitch- 
ing, touching and wig-wagging at a 
great rate, undoubtedly talking us 
over. By now there was no doubt in 
my mind that they knew exactly 
what they were doing.

IF 




“No bet, Dr. Peterson,” Eric 
said after a moment. “Not even for 
a finger or two of that Tennessee 
bourbon you’ve got hoardki. You 
have information we don’t.” 

“We’re guessing,” I said. “But 
they’re educated guesses. Put these 
two animals over there with the 
other one and watch.” 

What followed was predictable. 
Tails twitched, eyes rolled, black 
fingers flew as apparently every- 
body talked at once. And when, 
after a few minutes, they got caught 
up with the news — everybody 
stopped. Each animal retired to a 
corner of its cage, crouched into a 
comfortable ball and. sat watching, 
black eyes darting alertly. 

Lindy and I strolled out slowly 
and you may be sure they watched 
us go. At the shelter’s edge Lindy 
turned, went through a swift series 
of motions with both hands and 
ended by sticking out her tongue. 
It was silly— and a little uncanny, 
too — to see all three animals make 
the same gesture, then cover their 
eyes with their hands. 

P ^EGLEG is nothing if not per- 
sistent, so he did exactly what I 
knew he would do. He had reserved 
a scoutboat and pilot “for geo- 
logical reconnaissance along the 
Olympic Range” and, by his senior- 
ity, had grounded one set of cloud 
chasers. 1 heard them grumbling 
about it. But the request was legiti- 
mate and Pegleg never hogged 
equipment. 



Mount Olympus challenged him. 
And nothing does that to Pegleg 
and gets away with it. Not even a 
mountain. Especially not a moun- 
tain. And if this particular jumble 
of cliffs and pinnacles and obscur- ^ 
ing clouds was going to have se- 
crets, Pegleg intended to find them 
out or know the reason why. 

The silvery silver of the scoutboat 
drifted slowly over me as I sat on a 
high prominence, doing the kind of 
research' 1 like to do best. Just 
sitting and looking. That way I 
don’t disturb anything — life goes 
on normally and my binoculars can 
pick up any activity from horizon 
to horizon. And in this spectacular 
setting that took in a lot of terri- 
tory. My jumper sat nearby. 

“Any word for Zeus, Roscoe?^Or 
for Aphrodite, maybe?” 

Pegleg spoke down the tight 
auditory cone that can be projected 
from a scoutboat. He sounded as 
if he were standing beside me. I 
thumbed my belt connnunicator 
"Witch. The cone is one-way. 

“Carry my regrets,” 1 said. 
“Previous engagement and all that. 
Be careful, Pegleg.” 

I knew he would be. Pegleg is 
ornery and pig-headed, but his 
sense of self-preservation is as 
highly developed as that of any- 
body I know. He had been careless 
only once — and he would remem- 
ber it forever. He had lost his leg oh 
that occasion — it was bitten off 
smooth by a plesiosaur-type critter 
on a planet that’s not among my 



GODS ON OLYMPUS

pleasanter memories. His plastic 
leg works almost as well as the 
original^but it is a reminder. 

The scoutboat picked up momen- 
tum and swept into a great wide 
ellipse around the lower reaches of 
the mountain of the gods. Pegleg 
was going to tiake a deliberate, 
leisurely look-see. But he would be 
able to move if he had to. A scout- 
boat can flash over the horizon in 
one blink of an eye. 

I watched him disappear behind 
the great bulk of the uplift. When 
he reappeared a few minutes later 
on the other side he had apprecia- 
bly gained altitude. But eagles still 
looked down on the scoutboat. 
Almost casually it spiraled upward, 
loop after loop, and each time it 
reappeared it was closer to the 
slowly revolving bands of clouds. 

1 could imagine what Pegleg was 
doing. The photographic record he 
was making would be careful and 
complete. When he reached the 
cloud belts he would use radar and 
infrared light. He wouldn't disturb 
the clouds. Dissipators were out — 
verboten. We had cleared all that 
up in a long conference with Johnny 
Rasmussen. But there was no ruling 
against looking and Pegleg in- 
tended to look. Swathed in its 
forcefield, the scoutboat would 
sure Zeus in the eye if it got the 
chance. 

It seemed to me that the ^loud 
bands grew fluffier, thicker, and 
that they moved more deliberately, 
more naturally, as the scoutboat 



came nearer. Camouflage? Were 
they trying to pretend that they 
were normal clouds? From my 
vantage point the little ship was 
now so tiny that I had to put my 
glasses on full zoom to see it at 
all. The highest of the eagles was 
far below it. 

I SUPPOSE Pegleg planned it 
that way. Anyhow, he was on 
my side of the mountain when the 
scoutboat drifted against the high- 
est cloudbank, nosed into it and 
disappeared. There was no agita- 
tion, no turmoil. The scoutboat was 
simply swallowed up. 

I saw no cause for alarm. Pegleg 
didn’t need direct visibility. His 
radar was sensitive and good and 
he could throttle down to less than 
ten miles an hour if he had to. His 
forcefield would protect him. In 
point of fact, we’ve always had 
such overwhelming superiority 
over any and all life forms we’ve 
found that adventure, as far as 
hazard is concerned, is largely 
taken out. But there’s no guarantee. 
Pegleg had lost his leg. 

So, in spite of myself, I found my 
palms wet as minute followed min- 
ute and the scoutboat did not 
emerge. Once in a while I forgot to 
breathe. 

I knew that the big telescopes 
in the Stardust were watching, that 
a finely tuned radar was on the 
scoutboat, continuing to “see” it in 
the obscuring clouds. The distance 
was too great for metabolic probes.

IF 




but Pegleg had a setup on board 
the scoutboat that was monitoring 
automatically. If life existed behind 
the clouds on the peak he would 
pick it up. 

The next development wasn’t 
much. Not very much. Just — the 
clouds turned pink. 

1 saw no evidence of violence, no 
indication of concentrated energy 
release. The cloudbelt into which 
the scoutboat vanished simply 
began to glow as if touched by a 
ray of sunlight. The color deepened 
until the whole band looked like a 
rosy coronet on the vast brow of 
the mountain. The band speeded 
up, emitted several series of pink 
puffs — it seemed to oscillate, to 
expand and contract as it revolved. 
The sight was spectacular, but not 
awesome. There was no menace in 
it. And in the middle of the display 
the scoutboat darted into view 
again. 

Pegleg spiraled high, cut patterns 
above the loftiest clouds, above the 
hidden pinnacle. His behavior 
indicated neither annoyance nor 
anger. He was still just gathering 
data. And after a few sweeps the 
scoutboat pointed its nose at my 
lookout and began to grow steadily 
larger. It checked and drifted as it 
reached me. The whole reconnais- 
sance had taken scarcely an hour. 

“Come on down the hill, Ros- 
coe,” Pegleg said. “We’ve got con- 
ferring to do. You’ll be interested.’’ 

“Will do.’’ 1 spoke as though 
mountains that generated pink 



clouds were an everyday experi- 
ence. But 1 set the jumper on a flat 
trajectory, fifty yards at a leap, and 
by the time the scoutboat was back 
in its cradle I was landing on my 
jumper platform, extruded high on 
the Stardust's metallic side. 



1 INDY had not been able to stay 
i away from the “raccoon” 
cages. Once her own reconnais- 
sance pattern had been set up in the 
lab her assistants could do the 
work — she had gravitated instantly 
to the isolated shelter Jim Peters 
had arranged for the coons. The 
animals were different. She had 
been learning how and, hopefully, 
why. 

She had watched them, bombard- 
ing them with body pats and wig- 
wags, eye rolls and nose twitches. 
Since these had no meanings, the 
little animals were at first con- 
tinually giving the “^on’t under- 
stand” signal. This very fact had 
reinforced her conviction that the 
creatures were intelligent, aware, 
and were indeed communicating 
with each other in a complicated, 
soundless sign language. 

After the conference I went 
searching for my wife and found 
her with the coons. She had re- 
cruited powerful assistance. Ursula 
had moved in from the tundra. Her 
red umbrella was set up beside the 
awning that sheltered the cages. 
But she wasn’t painting. She had a 
sketch pad across her skinny knees 



GODSON OLYMPUS 



25 




and with a bit of charcoal made 
swift sketches, one after another, 
tearing them from the pad and 
dropping them. The ground around 
her was littered with them. 

Although Pegleg and I had news 
of our own, we stood by and 
watched while she and Lindy 
worked. There was evidently a 
pattern. They had something in 
mind. 

They ignored us while Lindy 
gathered up the sketches, sorted 
them, arranged them in sequences. 
I could see that each was only a few 
lines, but those lines cleverly indi- 
cated a coon giving a signal. No 
two were alike. 

When Lindy finished her sorting 
she faced the cages and began to 
hold up the sketches, one by one. 
One or two she used over and over. 
The little animals watched with 
round-eyed attention. There was no 
possible doubt that they knew 
exactly what she was trying to do. 
And when she finished all three of 
them suddenly threw themselves on 
the ground and rolled about, aim- 
lessly kicking out with thefr little 
black feet and lashing their bushy 
tails. Their faces wore no expres- 
sions, but I think we all got it at 
once. Xhcy were laughing. 

“The pen of my aunt is on the 
elephant’s back. Your signals are 
nonsense. They think you’re 
funny,’’ I said. 

“You told them a dirty joke,’’ 
said Pegleg. “They’re embarrassed. 

“In either case I couldn’t care 



less,’’ Lindy said with satisfaction. 
“I didn’t expect meaningful 
communication. I just wanted to 
verify the fact of thought transfer. 
And I wanted them to know we 
know.’’ 

“I imagine they already sus- 
pected that,’’ I said. “So where do 
we go from here?’’ 

Ursula was sketching again, 
apparently from memory. But this 
time she used a paint brush. Under 
her skilled fingers a recognizable 
outline of the mountain grew, its 
crest swathed with bands of pink 
clouds, pink puffs blowing from 
them. She held it up for the coons 
to see. 

This means of communication 
must have been marvelous to them, 
those, lines and colors that looked 
like the thing itself. I still doubted 
that they handled equipment or 
tools themselves, although the 
small hands looked capable and 
versatile. They recognized the 
mountain, though. They grasped 
that we understood that the cloud 
patterns had meaning — that they 
were artificially formed. The round 
eyes stared at the sketch briefly and 
then they showed a human trait — 
they knew how to lie. They all made 
the swift motion of negation and 
covered their eyes with their hands. 

F or the second time in two 
days Ursula grinned — an 
almost unprecedented occurrence. 
“Fibbing,” she said. 

“Why?” askbd Pegleg. 



26 



IF 




“No idea. Can guess, though. 
They’re involved.” 

“Something taboo about it,” I 
suggested. “Could little varmints 
like these have a sense of the 
supernatural? Could they respond 
to orders from a mysterious source? 
Could they have a religion?” 
“Could it be they’re being ex- 
ploited? Are they being flim- 
flammed? Same difference.” 
Pegleg spoke from his own special- 
ized point of view. He rarely lets us 
down. If he has a good word for 
something we’re disappointed. 
Lindy winked at me. 

“Still there abideth in the world 
these three; suspicion, prejudice 
and cynicism. And the greatest of 
these is cynicism.” 

Pegleg’s narrow face showed no 
contrition. 

“You forget,” he said. “I am in 
possession 'of very recent data. 
I’ve been up where the gods were 
supposed to be.” He shook his head 
sadly. “The whole bit is a big fat 
double-cross. There ain’t no gods 
up there.” 

“Just unusual meteorological 
phenomena?” I prodded. I knew 
what he had found, of course. 

“Oh no. The clouds arc artificial, 
just as advertised. I analyzed a big 
sample. Mostly water vapor, as 
you’d suspect, but with some kind 
of stuff intermingled with it that 
makes a tough film. The chemists 
are playing with it. The clouds arc 
actually masses of tiny stable 
bubbles that break down very 



slowly. The pink was a pigment 
suspended among the bubbles. Very 
neat setup. Efficient and business- 
like.” 

“Had metabolic probes, didn’t 
you? No life?” Ursula’s strange 
eyes gleamed. 

Pegleg grinned. 

“Got your attention, did I? No 
life high up. Plenty farther down 
the mountain, but in variety — as 
you’d expect. Nothing too pre- 
dominant.” He paused and studied 
the little animals in the cages. They 
were busily discussing us — or so 
I presumed — among themselves. 
“No, the clouds came from aper- 
tures in the central pinnacle, whole 
clusters of them. Stuffs probably 
piped up from far below. Engi- 
neering job. How the thing is done 
I can’t imagine, but you can bet 
that it isn’t by the likes of them. 
Ergo, they’re being given the 
business.” 

“Reasonable,” I agreed, “but 
there’s another side. What about 
the hypothesis that they’re here to 
check us out? That they’re doing 
the same thing here that you were 
doing up on the peak? They don’t 
know how the Stardust functions 
cither — but I’ll give you odds they 
know what it is and what it does.” 

“Until we learn their sign 
patterns we can’t be sure,’’ Pegleg 
said. “I’ll grant, though, that 
beings that can lie are civilized. 
It’s an infallible indication.” 

“ — and the greatest of these 
is — ” Lindy didn’t finish repeating 



GODS ON OLYMPUS 



27 




her paraphrase. “Fll learn the 
signs. Since apparently they can’t 
make sound we can’t teach them 
speech. We’ll have to go with their 
way of communicating.” 

“At least it’s peaceful,” I ob- 
served. “Imagine a noiseless human 
race.” 

“Even sex-linked. Wow— noise- 
less males! DeHnitely an improve- 
ment,”. Ursula grunted. 

That settled that. Pegleg and I 
left the ladies to their machinations. 
We knew when we had worn out 
our welcome. 

IV 

ATTENTION, all research 
directive and supervisory 
personnel. Dr. Rasmussen requests 
the pleasure of your company at 
dinner, this date, black tie, appe- 
tizers at eighteen hundred hours. 
My advice — take him up on it. You 
got to eat somewhere.” 

Of all the announcements "he’s 
called on to make I think Stony 
Price enjoys the chiefs dinner 
invitations best. And to my knowl- 
edge he’s never yet read one 
straight. 

I had expected the dinner. One 
was due for several reasons. Peri- 
odically Johnny likes to see us at 
our best. To him that means 
trimmed, shaved and in dinner 
dress. He can envision no crime 
to compare with a poorly cut 
dinner jacket. He loves fine food, 
properly served, and feels that 



every civilized man should. He 
reserves his ultimate respect for 
a superior brandy. 

The above would justify the 
dinner, but Johnny’s invitations 
always had an additional reason. 
This was rarely announced and 
there have been times when 1 never 
found, out what it was. Still, after 
you got past the starchy beginnings, 
the dinners were enjoyable in them- 
selves. Nobody ever missed one. 

“Don’t be surprised,” Lindy said, 
“if the dinner conversation takes 
an ecumenical turn.' Pegleg, for 
one, is still not sure the gods don’t 
exist.” 

“He’s sure they do,” I said. “He 
simply suspects their motives. I 
do fear that he thinks they rate 
power and profit over salvation. 
But he’s interested in how they 
operate.” 

“Thus lumping them with all 
the religions he has known in the 
past.” Lindy laughed. “Here, zip 
me. I’ll exhale.” 

It was a pleasure. I meshed the 
magnetic fastenings up her shapely 
back, enclosing her in a softly 
glowing white sheath that fitted 
only a little less perfectly than her 
skin. Blue slippers were on her 
feet, a blue orchid at her left 
shoulder, long blue pendants 
swung from her earlobes and her 
green eyes looked from under 
shadowed upper lids. Atop her 
regal head the red curls were piled 
in a spectacular coiffure that is 
always, somehow, uniquely fitting. 



28 



IF 




No woman will ever be like my 
woman. 

“1 hope,” I said, “that Johnny 
hasn’t seated you across from me. 
I’ll forget to eat.” 

“Then for your sake,” Lindy said 
gravely, “I hope so, too. You 
certainly need your food.” 

If ever solicitude was suspect, 
that was. You know what I look 
like. Thick-armed, thick-legged, 
barrel-chested, all visible areas 
covered with black hair except my 
face and the top of my head. Even 
above the dinner jacket Johnny 
requires, my rudely cut features 
look harsh, out of place. But a 
man can’t help how he appears. He 
can only hope that somewhere 
there’s a woman who can see past 
such things. There I’ve been lucky. 

D r. williams, Dr. Frost, 

Miss Potts, Dr. Kissinger, 
Dr. Peterson—” Johnny Ras- 
mussen stood behind his chair at 
the head of the long curving table, 
tall, immaculate, elegant, and 
pronounced our names with evident 
relish. He finished and said, “I am 
delighted to have you here this 
evening. Won’t you please be 
seated?” 

It was routine, formula. We 
could have chanted it with Kim. 
The only thing that changed was 
the seating. Johnny arranged that, 
always to suit some devious pur- 
pose of his own. Sometimes I could 
figure it out. Just as often, not. 
Chairs scraped and the conversa- 



tional hum began to build. Johnny 
had put Pegleg on his right, a thing 
he would do only because he needed 
him for some reason. Pegleg’s 
caustic conversation was incompat- 
ible with the genteel small talk 
behind which the chief masked his 
thoughts and gathered his infor- 
mation. But the two of them 
chatting like old buddies as the 
soup came and empty bowls went. 
A hearty tossed green salad, grown 
in the Stardusts own hydroponic 
rooms, appeared and was sampled. 
And finally the entree. That, too, 
was homegrown. Crab imperial. 
Honest. On Earth the Chesapeake 
Blue Crab is no more — its ancestral 
home is a cesspool of industrial 
wastes. But in the growing section 
of our space home, in three care- 
fully managed tanks, Callinectes 
sapidus goes through its life cycle 
just as it has since it evolved and 
provides, from time to time, a 
succulent harvest for special events 
such as these. 

I divided my attention between 
Lindy and Ursula Potts. Ursula’s 
dinner dress was an unrelieved 
gunmetal gray and her bun, neat 
for once, seemed almost to blend 
into its prim high collar. She wore 
a massive emerald on her right 
forefinger — an emerald not of 
Earth-^and her favorite necklace 
of polished scarlet seeds from some 
planet we had visited. She was 
small and scrawny, but she 
matched me bite for bite. She 
scooped it in like a lumbeijack. 



GODS ON OLYMPUS

“Pegl^’s in the catbird seat 
tonight,” I remarked. “Any idea 
why?” 

Ursula's strange eyes flicked. 

“Johnny’s picking his brains,” 
she said. “Good at it, too. Would 
have to be, with Peglcg.” 

“But why here? He could get 
what he needs from Peglcg’s 
report.” 

Ursula’s thin lips savored a 
forkful of crab. 

“Not looking for what he remern- 
bers. Looking for what wouldn’t 
go into ^ report. Intangibles.” 

I nodded as I scraped my crab 
shells. They had served me two, 
but I could have done with one 
more. 

“The gods began as a joke. I 
guess they’re not anymore. Some- 
where under the mountain old 
Zeus, no matter what his form, 
does hold court. It took know-how 
to pipe the inside of a forty- 
thousand-foot peak. And why? 
For whom are the messages?” 

“Johnny’s questions, too, I think. 
That’s why we’re getting rare food 
tonight. Reminding us of the 
general emphasis. Whatever else 
we do, look for Zeus.” 

“You think he’ll make an 
announcement?” 

Ursula shook her head. 

“Won’t say a word. We’re sup- 
posed to have brains. Put two and 
two together.” 

I knew she was right. That was 
-the way Johnny operated. He 
wouldn’t tell us what to do. He 



would expect us to know. And 
somehow we always did. 

I turned to my other dinner 
companion. We were holding hands 
under the table. 

“You’re looking nice tonight,” 
I remarked. “What can you tell us 
about Zeus?” 

“1 expect to see him,” Lindy said. 
She surveyed my plate. “I didn’t 
take your appetite after all.” 

My smile is not a handsome 
production, but Lindy likes it. 

“Even left-handed,” I said, “a 
man must keep up his strength.” 

It was a go<xl evening. After the 
coffee and just a dash of a pale 
golden brandy some of us ad- 
journed to the big main lounge and 
sat and yarned until the unfamiliar 
patterns of stars on the viewscreens 
began to dim with the approach of 
morning. Without saying it, every- 
one was agreed. The unifying 
objective of this look-see had 
crystallized. It was — the identity 
and the nature of the gods on 
Mount Olympus. 

R andom reconnaissance was 
over. The scoutboats were 
scheduled for days in advance as 
research units prowled up and 
down the mighty range for 
thousands of miles. Jumper teams 
fanned out, some probing deep 
into the valleys and canyons among 
the peaks, others working their 
way down through the vast forests 
into the dense and soggy atmo- 
sphere of lower elevations. 



30 



IF 




I stayed nearby. It wasn’t that I 
didn’t want to go anywhere. I felt 
that 1 was already somewhere — 
that here on the shoulder of the 
big peak was where the action was 
likely to be. For nowhere was there 
evidence of advanced technology, 
no sign of beings that might be 
aware. None, that is, except the 
three little coons in their cages. 
And three seemed to be all there 
were going to be. No more were 
caught. 

By now, though, I knew they 
were common. Fleeting glimpses 
were reported by various Held 
teams. 1 had caught brief views 
myself. In every case the animal 
had vanished quickly, presumably 
underground, but there were no 
evidences of burrows. Not, that is, 
until I figured it out. 

They were watching us. I was 
sure of that. And whenever I sat 
and surveyed and made notes I 
looked, for them with the same 
casual air that I’ve found to work 
so well with other life forms. When 
one finally showed himself I knew 
exactly what to do. 

He disappeared the minute I 
moved. I knew he would. I went 
directly to the spot where I had 
last se^n him, raised the stone 
behind which he had vanished. It 
belied its solid, half-buried appear- 
ance. It was pumice light and under 
it was the burrow entrance. 

I did. nothing about it. The 
tunnel angled sharply away from 
the opening and I was not so naive 



as to think that the little beast was 
trapped. That tunnel led into a 
maze under the tundra. Somehow 
I knew it was so. I didn’t even 
report my find. I could see no point 
in having scores of people prowling 
the tundra, tipping over stones, 
setting traps at burrow entrances 
and otherwise alerting the odd 
little creatures that we knew where 
they were. 

For thby were aware. They 
thought. They comprehended. How 
extensively, how deeply, I didn’t 
know. But Lindy had learned many 
symbols of their sign language. 
She could greet them, ask them 
simple questions. They could return 
the greeting, evade the questions 
and ask others of their own. Lindy 
was working hard. She was con- 
vinced that they were complex, 
even wise. 

Ursula took me farther. She had 
returned to the tundra and day after 
day her red umbrella marked her 
location as she painted tirelessly. 
Not always was her subject before 
her as she worked. And one day she 
beckoned to me as 1 passed her at 
a distance. I strolled over. 

“What do you think, Roscoe?” 
Ursula had asked me that a hun- 
dred times. She never specified 
what about, but usually it was 
easy enough to figure. This time 
it was the painting. 

Here was no view of the spec- 
tacular range she faced, no 
meticulous, detailed drawing of 
the nearby tundra. Ursula’s picture

abounded in blues and shadowy 
grays, with occasional brilliant 
patches of color, oranges and reds 
and rainbow streamers trailing and 
radiating from them. It was vague, 
impressionistic, yet as I studied 
it it took form and I recognized 
what it had to be — a vast cavern, 
illuminated from* glowing sources 
suspended high, with great dim 
arches that seemed to lead on into 
other caverns — an impression of 
immensity that only a great artist 
could give. 

Nothing was actually recogniz- 
able — or so I thought until 1 came 
close again and studied the canvas 
carefully. Tiny figures were on the 
cavern floors, hints of the same 
figures on irregularities of the 
cavern walls, creatures infinitesi- 
mally small compared to the 
spreading, vaulting spaciousness of 
the cavern. Raccoons! Most were 
simply tiny, vaguely familiar 
smudges, but a few were painted in 
exquisite detail. 

Once again I was impressed by 
the eerie sixth sense that made 
Ursula unique. She hadn’t painted 
the range — somehow she had 
looked into that mighty uplift. And 
what she had painted made no 
sense, geologically. But at the 
same time, it fitted. 

“The surface rocks of these 
mountains are granitic, Ursula,” 
I said. “Rhyolites and basalts lie 
under them. No sediments. There 
couldn’t be a cavern system under 
there.” 



Ursula shrugged. 

“Feel it,” she said. “Got to be. 
Don’t know why.” 

“It would explain a lot,” I 
admitted. “The hollow pinnacle 
of Olympus. No coons above 
ground. 1 know they’re subter- 
ranean. I’ve found burrows. But 
how would they live? What would 
they eat? And don’t tell me those 
little varmints send the cloud 
signals from the big peak.” 

Ursula’s strange eyes gleamed. 
“Not telling you anything. Don’t 
know.” She never looked more like 
a witch. “Your job,” she said. 

I shrugged in my turn. 

“Well,” I said, “it beats just 
hanging around the house.” 



M atters were finally be- 
ginning to move, though. 
I formed hypotheses, modified 
them, discarded them. Jim Peters’ 
trappers had discovered the bur- 
rows capped with rocks strangely 
like the native granite and yet so 
light they could be tipped over with 
a finger. As 1 expected, they set 
traps everywhere. Much good it 
did them. They caught nothing. 
The coons knew that we were on to 
them. 

Then, overnight, twa . things 
happened. Lindy went out for her 
morning signaling session with the 
three little coons and found the 
cages empty, the doors unlatched 
and swinging. And Pegleg 
disappeared. 



32 



IF 




The first I had expected. There 
was not much doubt that the coons 
had been staying around for what 
they could learn. Jim Peters had 
admitted as much, but he hadn't 
believed they could handle his 
magnetic locks. He had thought 
they had outsmarted themselves 
by letting themselves be caged. He 
had been complacent — now he was 
both amused and annoyed when he 
found how neatly he had been 
gulled. 

“I’m slipping, Roscoe,” he told 
me. “Can’t analyze a situation like 
I used to. Getting old.” I’d have 
guessed Jim at about thirty-five. 
We don’t wave our ages about. In 
space they’re pretty meaningless 
anyhow. “Why — ” he scratched his 
unkempt, sandy hair — “it used-to 
take an expert to fool me. Now 
look.” 

I consoled him. “They’re experts. 
A neat little variant of the Trojan 
Horse gambit — they took advan- 
tage of the fact that we probably 
wouldn’t believe their full capa- 
bilities. They were so right that 
now we’ve got to reassess the 
whole situation. How capable are 
they? What kinds of information 
were they able to acquire just 
sitting in those cages and 
watching?” 

“And what will they be able to 
do with it now they’ve got it? They 
may not be taking kindly to un- 
announced visitors. There’s no 
doubt that we’ve upset the pattern 
of their living simply by being 



here. Though I suppose that always 
happens.” 

“It hinges on the gods,” I 
decided. “The ruling intelligence, 
the guiding spirit of this part of the 
planet, is centered on the big peak, 
on old Olympus up there. Those 
little varmints may isimply be handy 
adjuncts to the establishment. On 
the other hand, they may run the 
place.” 

“There are plenty of them,” Jim 
said. “I suppose you know about 
the burrows.” 

“There’s more to it than that,” 
1 said and told him about Ursula’s 
picture. 

“Things are picking up,” the 
zoologist said happily. “If there 
is a cavern system we’ll find it. 
Always something new.” 

“1 can sec you now,” 1 said, 
“working your way into a nether 
world through a twisting cooii 
burrow one foot in diameter. It’ll 
be the high spot of your career.” 

“Low spot,” Jim corrected. “I’ll 
do what I have to do.” 

And that at least was a serious 
statement. 

Pegleg wasn’t missed until even- 
ing and even then we knew little 
concern. His work habits are 
unconventional. He usually goes 
alone; he drives that jeq> into places 
no sane, practical-minded field 
man would even consider driving. 
He can change from wheels to 
tracks at need and the timonium 
pill he uses for power is good for a 
half-million miles. His forcefield

unit can sheathe the vehicle in a 
shield that will foil any primitive, 
raw power. So when he turned up 
missing we didn’t worry, ^t had 
happened before. 

Still, a day and a half without 
communication was a long time 
even for Pegl^. When we reached 
that stage Johnny Rasmussen set 
in motion what we called the 
Misplaced Personnel pattern. 
Every scoutboat that went out was 
on search alert, watching for the 
jeep and with radio channels opein 
for every wavelength possible to the 
jeep communicator. Stony Price 
winnowed the high frequencies for 
unusual sound. Every field unit 
was notified. 

Rasmussen quizzed me. He 
thought that 1 would know what 
Pegleg had had in mind if anybody 
would. As it happened, I didn’t. 
I hadn’t even seen him go out. But 
I remembered something. 

The previous evening, almost at 
dusl^, there . had been unusual 
activity of the clouds on Mount 
Olympus. They had grown black 
like thund'erheads^wirling sullenly 
as if in anger. The clouds were 
changii^ all the time, but this was 
different. Johnny Rasmussen 
agreed. 

“It could be the key,’’ he said. 
“Up to now it would have been 
interesting to find out about the 
gods. Now 1 think we must.’’ 

You know how I felt. Pegleg was 
my oldest friend, my fleld com- 
panion on dozens of worlds. From 



me he needed a special kind of 
help. There would be searchers in 
plenty, but I knew best how he 
thought, what motivated him, 
what made him tick. My job was 
to think— in addition to all those 
pretty rocks, what else had he had 
in mind? 

I reasoned that he had offended 
the gods. He had invaded the 
shrouded peak of the sacred 
mountain, had violated their holy 
of holies. So they had waited for 
him and when opportunity finally 
allowed, they had taken him. So 
I built my thinking — a nice, reason- 
able, logical sequence. I was wrong. 

V 

F or a day our search patterns 
blanketed the range — but it 
was a vast land to be lost in. The 
way Pegleg drove he could have 
dropped that jeep into any one of 
thousands of crevasses in hundreds 
of glaciers that flowed down the 
shoulders of peak' after peak. Any 
rubble slide in any canyon in all 
that seamed network could have 
covered him up forever. We knew 
that, but we didn’t falter. We 
searched on. 

The clouds on Mount Olympus, 
were tranquil for that day, but 
then they changed. The next sunrise 
found them billowing, crowding 
into strangely shaped masses, 
shooting out colored pur's in com- 
plicated patterns. And the coons 
b^an to appear. 



34 



IF 




Until then we had caught only 
fleeting glimpses. Suddenly they 
were everywhere. A coon sat 
jauntily atop every rock. They 
darted here and there in the open 
spaces, sometimes even pausing 
to feed. I had speculated about 
that and watched the procedure 
with interest. I had been pretty 
sure that they ate a variety of 
things. Jim Peters had fed his 
captives a mixture of local organics 
and they had eaten most of it. Here, 
though, each feeding pattern was 
identical. A pink, lilylike plant a 
foot or so high sheeted wide 
stretches of tundra. Often it was 
the most abundant plant in view. 
The coons harvest^ it with a 
stylized procedure that never 
varied — and it was soon evident 
why it was so abundant. 

The coons fed on the bulk from 
which the lily grew. They dug it 
out with practiced twists of their 
little black hands, nipped off the 
stem with glistening white teeth, 
then removed a purple berry from 
the top of the stalk where the flower 
had been. This fruit they planted in 
the hole they had dug. They covered 
it carefully. Then, and only then, 
they ate the bulb with relish. 

As you can imagine, I was torn. 
One of the mysteries of life on 
Olympus Two was uhfolding before 
my eyes— but one of the Stardusts 
veteran researchers was lost, swal- 
lowed up in the impressive environ- 
ment of these strange little beings. 
What should I do? I was high on 



my favorite slope and the coons 
swarmed around me, avoiding my 
boulder seat but otherwise ignoring 
me. 1 felt guilty, but I watched and 
made notes. I knew it was what 
Pegleg would have done — what, 
perhaps, he was doing at that mo- 
ment. For the coons were out as 
far as 1 could see the tundra. 
Ursula’s painting had prepared me 
a little, but .the numbers were 
incredible. 

My belt communicator rasped 
and sputtered. 

“Dr. Kissinger.” It was Stony 
Price. “Dr. Rasmussen calling Dr. 
Kissinger. Come in, Roscoe.” 

I thumbed my transmission but- 
ton. “Roscoe here. Stony.” 

“Thank you, Mr. Price.” Johnny 
Rasmussen’s calm, genteel voice. 
“We’ve got news of Pegleg, Ros- 
coe. George Wildcat trailed the 
jeep by jumper and he found — but 
let him tell you. Could you patch 
him in, Mr. Price?” 

More rattling and rasping. Then, 
“Wildcat here. Dr] Kissinger.” 
The soft voice was as unemotional 
as the chiefs had been. 

“Tell, Wildcat,” I urged. 

“An interesting trail. Dr. Kis- 
singer,” Wildcat said gently. “I am 
about a hundred and eighty miles 
southwest of the Stardust — in a 
deep box canyon between the 
fourth and fifth peaks south of 
Mount Olympus. Dr. Williams 
came here. 1 now have great ad- 
miration for that jeep. You would 
not believe the route he topk,” 



GODS ON OLYMPUS 



35 




“I’d believe it,” 1 said. “Where’s 
Pegl^ now?” 

Wildcat hesitated. 

“There is a large cavern opening 
in the ^nd of the canyon. Appar- 
ently he drove in. I tried my jumper 
communicator at the cavern mouth, 
but got no response from the jeep. 
Welt protected search teams seem 
indicated.” 

“How can we get there?” 

“A scoutboat seems best. At 
least you can reconnoiter from the 
air and then bring in jumper teams 
if you think it wise. I can give you 
coordinates and stand by to beam 
you in.” 

“Right. How about the coon 
population there?” _ 

“They are everywhere. They are 
coming out of the cavern in droves. 
But they don’t seem interested in 
me. They ignore me. 

“All same here. This is a very big 
deal, probably not related to Peg- 
leg at all.” 

“It is related to the cloud signals 
on Mount Olympus,” Wildcat 
stated. “Notice that they’re chang- 
ing as we talk.” He paused a 
minute. “Have you eagles?” 

1 had noticed them gathering, 
but they were soaring high. Now 1 
realized that they were beginning 
to plane lower — and that there were 
thousands of them. 

“We’ve got eagles,” I said, “and 
they’re coming down.” 

I N A matter of minutes the great 
birds were swooping all around 



me. The swish and whistle of the 
wide-pinioned wings must have 
made a roar in my microphone — 

I could also hear them in my 
speaker. One hundred and eighty 
miles away the same thing was 
evidently going on. And at the end 
of each dive was a coon. 

Actually the eagles’ hunting 
wasn’t that easy. The coons leaped, 
dodged, swayed out of the way of 
the reaching talons with a facility, 
a cool competence that indicate 
practice. They had expected this 
and the birds often missed. But 
many a bird soared up again with 
a limp furry form clutched in its 
long claws. The slow, the dull, the 
unskilled, the unlucky — these 
were being pruned out fast. 

My sulKonscious was auto- 
matically recording and interpret- 
ing all this, while my conscious 
mind was rejecting it. A deliber- 
ately planned survival ritual, 
executed by the numbers on orders 
broadcast by cloud patterns on a 
giant mountain peak — it seemed 
impossible. But somehow I knew 
it was so. The tundra was honey- 
combed with burrows capped by 
rocks that the coons could move 
with ease. Safety was only a few 
leaps away. But not one attempted 
to leave the action. They stayed, 
trusting to the speed and agility of 
their own muscles, pitting their 
alertness and timing against the 
fearsome swoops of the huge birds. 

As a precaution I stepped into my 
jumper frame and activated the 



36 



IF 




forcefield. But it wasn't needed. 
The birds avoided me. The coons 
used me, dodging around me as 
though I were a rock. And after a 
few minutes the rain of swooping, 
diving eagles thinned, until only an 
occasional one threatened the 
still teeming numbers of coons. 
These last birds, I suspected were 
themselves young and inexperi- 
enced, still honing their food- 
getting skills. The whole mighty 
spectacle, as I viewed it, was one 
of grim practicality. But I had 
never seen anything like it. As Peg- 
leg was wont to say, most of the 
experiences we have seem to be 
firsts. 

At the thought of Pegleg I again 
remembered my purring communi- 
cations speaker. Our three-way 
patch was still open, but for min- 
utes we had been sp>eechless. 

“Still there. Wildcat?" 

“Still here. Dr. Kissinger. Fm 
sure we’ve seen the ^ame thing. 
May I come to hear you discuss it 
at the next convened report? I 
have some questions." 

I grinned a little wryly. 

“So have I, George. This is a 
situation where there are no ex- 
perts. Give me your coordinates. 
Fll be over you in half an hour. Will 
you order me a scoutboat, Johnny?" 

“It’s done," the chief said. 
“Waiting for you." 

It would take more than a 
swarming of coons and an invasion 
of eagles to disconcert Johnny 
Rasmussen. 



I WAS pleased with my scout- 
boat pilot and more than 
pleased with my crew. Young Pete 
Watts grinned at me from behind 
his instrument panels as I came 
aboard. He knows how I work. 
The second researcher’s seat was 
also rather ^11 filled by Lindy. 
She was dressed for the field, 
equipped with zoom binoculars, 
magnaflash and laser gun swinging 
from her belt. 

“I’m your best bet," she in- 
formed me. “The coons arc in- 
volved in this and I can communi- 
cate with them. You’re lucky to 
have me." 

“You’re always my best bet," 
I said. “Take her out, Pete. Lock 
on Wildcat’s* beam and follow the 
bouncing ball." 

“Roger, Dr. Kissinger." 

Pete was a researcher’s dream 
pilot. In the field he never asked 
why. 

The scoutboat spiraled, picked 
up the tracker’s weak signal and 
flashed toward it. In moments 
great cliffs loomed high. Skillfully 
Pete wove the ship among them, 
cutting down sp^ for better 
viewing. We were in a long canyon, 
maybe no^ more than a mile across, 
a rugged gash in the immensity of 
the range. Its floor was broken, 
scarred, boulder-strewn. I couldn’t 
imagine trying to tool a vehicle 
over that rugged terrain — but, 
knowing Pegleg, I could easily 
picture him doing it, switching 
from tracks to wheels to tracks 



GODSON OLYMPUS

again as the situation changed. 
What he had been looking for 
was anybody’s guess. But he had 
stumbled on something. Pegleg did 
nothing at random. 

“Cut it down, Pete,” I directed. 
“Slow cruise. We may as well 
glean all we can.” , 

The scoutboat drifted, loafing 
along a few hundred feet above the 
rocky bottom of the canyon. Wild- 
cat’s signal csTme ever stronger. 

“Look, Roscoe — the eagles.” 
Lindy’s binoculars swept the 
seamed and shattered canyon walls. 
Pinnacles jutted everywhere and 
atop practically every one a great 
bird sat and tore at the furry body 
beneath its talons. It was dinner- 
time in eagle land. Only a few still 
soared and searched, but to no 
avail now. The coons were gone. 

1 punched a communicator but- 
ton and cut into Wildcat’s signal. 

“Can you hear me. Wildcat? 
We’re coming in. What happened 
to the coons?” 

“Got you. Dr. Kissinger. The 
clouds on the peak changed color 
and the coons vanished. Just 
popped out of sight. The party’s 
over.” 

“Until next time,” I agreed. 
“Watch for us.” 

The canyon ended ahead. A 
vast dark wall, thousands of feet 
high, lay across it, boxing it in. 
Sunlight flickered on the immense 
stretches of rock, but the impres- 
sion was one of gloom, of cold- 
ness, of shadow. And we could 



see the huge opening, high as a 
four-story building, long before we 
picked out the tiny form of the 
tracker in the jumble of rocks be- 
low. Pete cut speed until the scout- 
boat barely had headway. 

I suppose my subconscious had 
decided, long before I consciously 
admitted what I intended to do. To 
crystallize and bring the decision 
to the surface required the sight 
of the great arching entryway. 1 
remembered Ursula’s painting. 
The caverns were in chains, in- 
describably large. Unless they 
held energies I could not now 
envision a scoutboat should be 
able to cruise them. 

My pilot knew what came next. 
He swung our little ship low over 
where Wildcat sat, then drifted in 
a tight circle at slowest speed. I 
activated the auditory cone. 

“This may be news to my crew, 
George, but we’re going to take the 
scoutboat into that hole. Can you 
think of any reason we shouldn’t?’' 
“Just ordinary common sense. 
Dr. Kissinger. I’d hate to do it. 
There are probably controlled 
energies in there and there’s no way 
to assess them. I went in a few 
hundred feet and lost all communi- 
cation. They let me keep my 
magnaflash.” 

“They?” 

“The coons. That’s their country 
in there. And they’re sharp. I 
wouldn’t be surprised if they could 
neutralize your motive power.” 
George Wildcat’s ancestry was 



38 



IF 




Mandan Sioux. He was Jim Peters' 
ace tracker. Give him a wilderness 
and a dim spoor and he was a 
happy young man. The planet 
didn't matter. And he could read 
from any situation far more than 
he could see. 

“Any installations? Any arti- 
facts? Anything they may have 
made?” 1 figured he must have 
something tangible on which to 
base so positive an attitude. 

“Negative. Like Miss Potts 
says, 1 just felt it. I came out be- 
cause I thought my first duty was 
to report. Since then I’ve been 
under orders.” 

“No criticism, George. You did 
exactly right. Notify the Stardust 
and keep your position to relay us 
if we can’t communicate directly 
with the ship. I’m going to bet that 
their energies can’t solve our 
forcefield.” 

I could hear wildcat’s faint sigh. 

“1 thought you would,” he said. 

M y PILOT’S face was serious, 
but also quizzical. He had 
taken me on some strange rides. 
He could make a scoutboat do any- 
thing it was built to do and put it 
through paces the designers had 
never imagined. This trip, I sup- 
posed, would be in that last 
category. 

“Take her in, Pete. Activate 
bumper rays outside the force- 
field — and go slowly. We want to 
see the sights.” 

A scoutboat is about forty feet 



long, eight feet wide. In space it 
looks like a featureless metallic 
silver, pointed at both ends. Its 
timonium drive can flash it through 
planetary atmospheres at speeds 
great enough to make it glow, or it 
can drift with scarcely perceptible 
headway. But it cannot hover and 
it cannot take off from any location 
except its slip in the Stardust. 
Hence it cannot land. 

These were not limitations. They 
were advantages in every situation 
in which scoutboats had ever been 
used. But it was unlikely that any- 
one had ever used one underground. 

We slipped through the huge 
opening. The light of the sun faded 
and there were no sights to see. 
Stygian blackness swallowed us. 
Pete activated dim lights. The 
scoutboat floated slowly forward. 
Dark craggy walls showed ahead, 
but athwart our direction the black- 
ness was unbroken. 

“Up the range, Pete. Toward 
Mount Olympus. I’m betting that 
the chain of caverns is continuous 
and somewhere ahead old Zeus is 
waiting for us.” 

The scoutboat swerved, then 
rocked gently as the bumper rays 
fended it from the wall. But it never 
lost headway. Pete eased it onward 
steadily, its radar keeping it posi- 
tioned halfway between the dimly 
revealed floor of the cavern and the 
vaulting ceiling above. We seemed 
suspended in black nothingness, 
going nowhere. 

“Any reason for not using mag- 



GODS ON OLYMPUS 



39 




naflash. Dr. Kissinger? We may be 
missing some of those sights you 
wanted to see. Radar wall patterns 
are pretty irregular.” 

“We’ll take a quick look,” I 
decided, “then switch ’em off again. 
Don’t want to overawe them, you 
know. Although I’ve got an idea 
they could light up this whole area 
if they wanted.” 

Actually, it wasn’t my idea. It 
was memory. I was recalling 
Ursula’s mystic, murky picture, 
with the flaring yellow and orange 
spots high in the vaulted upper 
reaches of the barely recognizable 
chain of caverns. Well, here were 
the caverns. Where was the rest? 

The wide cone of pure white 
light, brighter than day, lanced 
ahead of us. The scoutboat cruised 
slowly. We were moving into a huge 
vaulted amphitheater perhaps a 
mile wide, a dozen miles long. At 
its farther end there was a great 
tunnel-like exit, many times larger 
than the opening through which we 
entered the system. 

The sheer scale of the caverns 
changed my mind about the use of 
light. 

“Keep the big beam on, Pete,” 
1 directed. “Better activate ana- 
lytical systems, too. Air composi- 
tion, air currents, temperature 
fluctuations — the works. This a 
world within a world. A nation, a 
race of beings lives here. Let’s know 
all we can about it. Because sooner 
or later we’re going to be asked to 
show our ticket stubs.” 



“Piloting a scoutboat through 
the inside of a mountain range 
ought to take about all of a man’s 
attention,” Lindy said. “I’ll do the 
analyses. Dr. Kissinger. I’m rather 
used to that sort of thing.” 

“Thank you. Dr. Peterson,” I 
said gravely. “That will free me to 
watch.” 

“And what would you be watch- 
ing for — specifically?” 

“A small, anachronistic. Earth- 
type vehicle, my sweet.” Suddenly 
I was sober. “A jeep, 1 believe it’s 
called.” 

Just for a moment Lihdy’s 
sympathetic grin flashed. Then she 
was in the technicians seat forward, 
playing the complicated analytical 
console with practiced fingers and 
reading half a dozen stories from 
the flickering light banks. The 
scoutboat drove on — and I watched. 

S LOWLY the unreal terrain be- 
neath us gained character. 
What was at first a blurred jumble 
began to sort itself out. That was 
living space down there and grad- 
ually the details appeared. 

A key factor to everything we 
could see was evidently the light 
source that had been turned out. 
For this was not just a rocky world, 
though broken masses and piles of 
stony rubble predominated. My 
probing spotlight revealed these as 
multicolored, with such green, and 
the zoom binoculars showed lichen- 
like growth, lush and crisp, punctu- 
ated by clinging clusters of mush- 



40 



IF 




roomlike fungi in orange and 
scarlet and a whole range of blues. 
The light winked on small streams, 
“Of course,” I said aloud for the 
record. “The food base. The pro- 
ducers. They use the upper world, 
the planet’s surface, but they don’t 
depend on it. The food chains start 
here, powered at second hand by 
artificial light that can be 
controlled.” 

The strangeness of our situation 
gradually faded as the familiar, 
basic patterns of the ecosystem 
began to emerge. They sometimes 
took odd forms, alien sequences, 
but in the last analysis they showed 
the same framing. I began to feel 
comfortable again. This was my 
lifelong concern. Only the details 
were different. 

“A plant cover, varied,” I 
announced. “What’s the weather 
out there like. Dr. Peterson?” 
“Temperate,” Lindy intoned. 
“Rather high humidity, but good 
air circulation. Should be fresh and 
invigorating. Temperature seventy- 
one degrees Fahrenheit. And no 
sunshine at all.” 

“Are you sure?” 

For as she spoke the vast cavern 
suddenly was flooded with yellow 
light. The details I had been ob- 
serving piecemeal were spread out 
below, a strange, sunlit, enclosed 
landscape. And the very sun itself 
seemed to hang high in the vaulted 
upper reaches of this buried world.” 
“I don’t know when I’ve seen a 
quicker sunrise,” Lindy murmured. 



She pushed buttons, coaxed more 
data from the humming console. 
“No hard radiation, Roscoe. Light 
almost the same quality as sunlight. 
A bit more red.” She studied the 
light readout for a moment longer, 
then leaned back in her chair. 

“I’m glad- I came,” she an- 
nounced. “We are now transient 
visitants in the galaxy’s greatest 
controlled-environment chamber. 
That sun is a hydrogen ball, con- 
fined, activated and paced in some 
ungodly fashion I’ll never have 
sense enough to understand.” 

I STUD I ED the rocky floor 
slipping along beneath us. For 
some minutes 1 had been aware that 
the small stone piles scattered at 
random among the lichen-clad 
slides were too uniform, too pre- 
cise to be natural. The zoom binoc- 
ulars confirmed this. They looked 
like little stone igloos. I’d have 
guessed their origins anyhow, but 
close-ups left no doubt. Many had 
openings and bright-eyed little 
coons peered from them. I pointed 
them out. 

“Farm houses,” I said. 
“Complete with peasants,” 
Lindy agreed. “They’re predict- 
able. But those little creatures 
aren’t probing our forcefield. They 
can’t turn the sun off and on.” 

“I think 1 agree,” I said. “Still, 
something can — and I’d be a mite 
easier in my mind if 1 knew what.” 
“Let’s find out,” my wife said. 
“You know and I know that the 



GODS ON OLYMPUS 



41 




answer is up ahead. That’s where 
the jeep is— and Pegleg.” 

‘‘The gods?” 

‘‘The gods. And I still would like 
to have that little chat with Aphro- 
dite.” 

“You shall, my pet,” 1 said. 
“By the nine gods I swear it. Take 
her along, Pete. We^re betting that 
the caverns are continuous all the 
way to Mount Olympus and that 
the scoutboat can take us through. 
Be careful of intersections and U- 
turns, otherwise use your own 
judgment.” 

The pilot gave me a swift look 
and settled himself in his chair. 

“Roger, Dr. Kissinger,” he said 
happily. “I’ll try to get you there 
in time for dinner. We wouldn’t 
want the nectar and ambrosia to 
get cold.” 

I should have known better. But 
the next instant it was too late. The 
cavern walls were blurring, the 
scoutboat tilting and weaving and 
darting, and the cavern suns were 
flashing past like streetlamps along 
a village street. I would have lost 
face to have ordered a cut in speed 
— but I’ll never forget that ride. 

1 knew that the computer-pilot 
was plotting the course, altering 
it each microsecond as the radar 
fed in data. No human reaction 
time could possibly have been fast 
enough. But it was Pete who de- 
termined the speed and even in 
space he loved to move. What it 
was like in that linked netherworld 
of tunnels and caverns I leave you 



to imagine. I do remember won- 
dering fleetingly how I’d look with 
my hair all gray. 

Still, we got through. The scout- 
boat was slowing almost before my 
apprehensions were sorted out and 
justified. 

“Complications up ahead. Dr. 
Kissinger,” Pete reported. “Have 
to cut down a little. Sorry.” 

. I ignored Lindy’s slightly 
strained grin. 

“1 forgive you, Pete,” I said. 
“It may even be more dignified 
to approach heaven slowly.” 1 
look^ forward into the space we 
were just entering. “I see what you 
mean by complications.” 

VI 

W E HAD passed through 
many caverns, some of them 
extensive. Most of them had 
doubtless had installations of vary- 
ing complexity, but of course we 
had not truly seen them. What lay 
ahead we could see and it was 
impressive. 

This enclosure was not large 
compared to some we had tra- 
versed. It was perhaps three or 
four miles long, and half as wide. 
Two orange suns glowed a half- 
mile up. The effect was like a sum- 
mer noon on Earth. 

Here was no hint of the rural, 
the pastoral feel of the earlier caves. 
This one was structured, complex, 
used. Several features struck the 
eye. One was the forest of pylons, 



42 



IF 




slender metallic cylinders extend- 
ing upward from heights of a few 
feet to perhaps a couple of hun- 
dred. They occurred in clusters, 
strung out in lines, or in random 
isolation here and there all the 
way to the distant walls. They 
seemed to sprout from the rocky 
substrate, connected to nothing 
and there was no clue to their pur- 
pose. But their nature was soon 
apparent. 

“Energy pylons. Dr. Kissinger,’’ 
Pete reported. “My meters are 
jumping. Every one of those things 
is hot.” 

“Are they focusing on us? Is the 
forcefield under stress?” 

The pilot shook his head. We 
were now barely drifting and I 
noticed that we were swinging 
wide to avoid the higher cylinders. 

“Negative on both counts. 
Everything is normal. But the 
potential is there. Somehow each 
cylinder is a transmission device. 
Whether any of them could cause 
us any grief— no way to tell. No 
data.” 

“We still do it, don’t we?” Lindy 
looked up from her console. “The 
old Earth attitude. The human 
point of view. Why should they 
want to cause us grief? Maybe it’s 
no part of their thinking at all. 
Perhaps we’re simply objects of 
wonder to be explain^, not 
destroyed.” 

“Every ecosystem is based on 
strife,” I pointed out. “Every living 
thing in a natural system has com- 



peted successfully. Otherwise it’s 
dead. That’s an advanced setup 
down there. It didn’t get that way 
without effective defences. It may 
shoot first and investigate after- 
ward.” 

“Since it hasn’t maybe it won’t,” 
Lindy said. “Incidentally, there’s 
still no hard radiation with the 
light and the air is sweet and good. 
Even the humidity is no higher in 
spite of all the steam pits.” 

Steam lakes or steam ponds 
would have been more accurate. 
They dotted the cavern floor and 
condensation mists rose from them, 
drifting and dissipating in the air. 
Some had multicolored deposits 
built up along their edges. Water 
ran from them in wide, glistening 
sheets. Fumaroles puffed and blew. 
A steaming jet of water topped with 
a cloud plume climbed to medium 
pylon height for several minutes as 
we watched, then slowly subsided. 

I swept the area with my ever- 
useful zooms, while Pete drifted 
the scoutboat slowly in random 
patterns back and forth. He knew 
me. He was waiting for orders. 

“I’m beginning to understand,” 
I said finally. “Hydrothermal 
energy. Plenty of it. A subterranean 
geyser basin. Probably been here 
for eons. Somehow they’ve learned 
to convert it, to harness it. They’ve 
built a culture around it. All the 
rest is detail.” 

“So we’re back to they,'' Lindy 
said. “Who arc theyl" 

I grinned at her. 



gods ON OLYMPUS 



43 




“The gods,” i said. ‘‘The gods 
of Mount Olympus. 1 would sus- 
pect that we're under their moun- 
tain. Confirm, Pete?” 

‘‘Confirm, Dr. Kissinger,” the 
pilot said. ‘‘Or in the neighborhood, 
at least. We’ve come the right 
distance in the right direction. I’d 
say this is it.” 

The complex of installations be- 
low also seemed to confirm it. Not 
that it looked like any industrial 
arrangement we had ever envi- 
sioned or experienced. But there 
were piled clusters of rock struc- 
tures built against the cavern wall 
in one location, a random-appear- 
ing jumble that stretched along the 
wall for several hundred yards. And 
it swarmed with coons. 

“Drop us in, Pete,” I directed. 
“Slowly. Let them see us at close 
range. Then it’ll be their move.” 

“I think it’s already ours.” 
Lindy’s glasses were sweeping the 
strange artifacts. “Look, Roscoe. 
Halfway along the building com- 
plex — beside the tallest pylon.” 

It was Pegleg’s jeep. 

T he scoutboat nosed down 
gently. It must have been a 
marvel to the thronging, bright- 
eyed little creatures that darted in 
and out of the myraid openings of 
the building complex, lliere were 
literally acres of them. They made 
a seething, shifting pattern as we 
swept slowly over them at a height 
of forty feet or so. 

“No sign of P^leg?” I kept the 



anger out of my voice, but Lindy 
sensed it. 

“Take it easy, Roscoe,” she 
soothed me. “He’s probably guest 
of honor at that dinner we’re late 
for. I can’t feel hostility. Just in- 
terest and curiosity. They’ll be 
delighted to set some plates for us.” 

“They’ll have their chance,” I 
said shortly. “I’m going down. 
Swing out the ladder, Pete, and 
make a run at twenty feet. I’ll drop 
off beside the jeep.” 

The scoutboat turned in a tight 
circle and b^an Its glide. The 
speed slowed almost to the pace 
of a walking man. The emergency 
hatch next to my seat slid back, 
the pliable ladder dropped through 
and I climbed down to swing free 
beneath the ship. It was a practiced 
gambit. We us^ it often. 

Coons scurried as I dropped from 
the ladder. 1 strode over and stood 
with my back against the jeep, hand 
on my laser, my eyes trying to take 
in the whole improbable situation. 

The coons surrounded me, row 
on row and rank on rank, bright 
eyes rolling, black hands flying, 
tails twitching. I could hear the 
shuffle of thousands of little feet, 
but otherwise they made no sounds 
at all. The gurgle of flowing water, 
the hiss and pop of the boiling 
springs, the splash of geysers — 
these were the noises of this hidden 
world. 

I thumbed my communicator 
switch. 

“Calling Dr. Williams. Kis- 



44 



IF 




singer calling Dr. Williams. Speak 
up, Pegleg.” 

I didn't expect an answer. But 
I got one. Promptly, too. 

My open receiver rasped and 
cleared its throat. Pegleg’s voice 
came, understandable enough, but 
rather muffled and faint. 

“Williams here. Where are you, 
Roscoe?” 

He didn't sound distressed and 
suddenly I felt good again. I hadn't 
realized how the tension had been 
building. 

“A better question is — where are 
you? I'm in front of the biggest 
rockpile. Standing by the jeep. 
Direct me and I'll come get you." 

Pegleg's chuckle rattl^ the 
receiver. 

“You wouldn't get far. Heaven 
is a pretty complicated place. Hold 
tight and I'll try to come to you. I 
don't think they'll stop me from 
walking out. But they've taken my 
gun. So watch yours." 

“Roger. Leave your communi- 
cator open." 

The first ring of coons was ten 
feet away from me and they didn't 
seem disposed to come closer. But 
their restless fingers and twitching 
tails never stopped. Their motions 
seemed to have developed a 
rhythm — then I realized that they 
were all going through the same 
patterns. They were all saying the 
same thing and in unison. They 
didn't seem unfriendly, but there 
was certainly no way to tell. 

I watched them for several 



minutes. The shadow of the scout- 
boat drifted across and for a mo- 
ment all eyes were on it. Pete was 
staying close. If it came to that, he 
could lash that sea of furry bodies 
with savage, disintegrating energy. 
But what they might do in return 
was entirely problematical. The 
slender pylon behind me reached 
up for more than a hundred feet. 

So, as Pegleg advised, I held 
tight. The coons continued their 
swinging pattern, speeding it up, 
giving it a jive beat. The concept 
seemed ridiculous, but I think they 
were having fun. If they had not 
been voiceless I'm sure they would 
have been chanting. It could have 
been, Yah-yah, or it could have 
been. Welcome to our city, Lindy 
might have, known. I didn't. And 
after a bit it became irritating. I 
made the gesture remembered 
from the three little coons in Jim 
Peters' cages and briefly covered 
my eyes with my hands. 

T hat interested them. The 
soundless chant stopped. The 
front row surged forward a couple 
of feet, but I waved it back and put 
my hand on my gun. They under- 
stood all right. They had taken 
Pegleg's gun. I wondered briefly 
how they had managed that. 

The scoutboat came over again, 
drifting slowly, ladder trailing. 
Lindy swung ofT into the little 
circle. 

“Apologies, Roscoe. I know you 
didn't call me. But 1 hate to sit

in. the grandstand when a game is 
going on. After all, you don't know 
what they’re saying.” 

Lindy’s beautiful anytime, but 
never more so than when her in- 
terest is focused on a problem, 
especially a problem with living 
things. Then she glows. Any danger 
that might have been in this situa- 
tion she simply ignored. 

“I’m waiting for Pegleg,” 1 
explained. “He’s back in that rock- 
pile somewhere, apparently. But 
he says he can come out.” 

“I know. We heard. And mean- 
while they’re trying to tell you 
something and I might just be able 
to figure out what.” She misted her 
green eyes at me. “You don’t mind, 
do you Roscoe? Just you keep 
watch. I’ll do the talking.” 

I shrugged with mock resigna- 
tion — or maybe it wasn’t entirely 
mock. 

“Don’t you always? What’s a 
wife for?” 

She was the focus of thousands 
of pairs of sly black eyes as she 
made motions, touched herself in 
patterns, even held a hand behind 
her to simulate a tail. And when 
she paused, the watchers erupted 
into a sea of motion. Everybody 
talked at once. It seemed a racial 
failing. 

She made the now familiar ges- 
ture and covered her eyes. The 
motions subsided. Then she pointed 
to one coon in the first row, 
beckoned him forward. He under- 
stood. He took a couple of steps 



into the circle and sat upright, his 
black hands folded on his chest. 

Lindy tried her signs again. She 
pointed at the jeep, swept an arm 
to indicate the complex of build- 
ings, made a motion that even I 
could interpret. Where? Where 
was the man who drove the jeep? 

They knew, all right. The spokes- 
man didn’t have to answer that 
one. The sea of heads swiveled 
toward the rock structure opposite. 
I suppose it was the most imposing' 
of the complex, though they all 
looked pretty much alike to me. 
But it was by far the biggest, a 
multidomed jumble that reached 
forty or fifty feet up the cavern wall 
and had a frontage half a block 
long. The seat of a personage — or 
personages. 

The spokesman graphically con- 
firmed my surmise. He lay prone, 
his snout pressed into the dust, his 
hands clasped behind his head. A 
position of subservience, of sub- 
mission. Authority lived in that 
rock pile. 

My communicator crackled. 

“I think I’m almost out, Roscoe.” 
Pegleg’s voice was clearer. “I’m 
not so good on these ladders. Any- 
how, I have to proceed with 
dignity. I’m being escorted and 1 
get the impression that it’s quite 
an honor. Wait’ll you see.” 

“Roger,” I said. “Waking.” 

The openings in the rock dwell- 
ings, were all coon-sized. A man 
could scarcely have thrust his head 
into them. But the big house, the 



46 



IF 




paUce or whatever it was, boasted 
a portal. It was easily five feet high, 
three feet wide, and into the wall 
around the opening were set sheets 
of glistening mica. Pegleg emerged 
from this imposing aperture, bend- 
ing to clear it. Pegleg is six feet tall. 

He gave us a wave, then stood 
aside as his escort came slowly and 
with dignity into the light. We 
were a hundred feet away and I 
promptly swung up my binoculars. 
Qf the several possibilities that I 
had considered, I suppose 1 had 
given this one the least weight. 
For the escort was merely another 
coon. 

Correction. Not merely another 
coon. There couldn’t have been 
another like him along that entire 
cavern chain, not on this whole 
great planet called Olympus Two. 

He was coal black. He was easily 
three times the size of any coon I 
had yet seen. He walked erect on 
plantigrade feet, striding delib- 
erately, his facile hands gesturing. 
He was abundantly, blatantly 
male. 

They approached us slowly. Peg- 
leg one step behind his host, a wide 
pathway opening as they advanced. 
The thousands of coons watched, 
but the waving, twitching conver- 
sation was stilled. Each made a 
single, one-handed gesture as the 
big coon passed, a gesture of 
respect. 

. When they stood before us. Peg- 
leg made the introduction with a 
wave of his hand. “Zeus,” he said. 



W E STARED most impo- 
litely, but what do you do 
when you’re introduced to a god? 
Lindy adjusted first. She made the 
same motion the coons had made, 
the gesture of respect. 1 followed 
suit awkwardly. Pegleg watched us, 
grinning. 

“You’re kidding, Pegleg,” I 
said. 

“You know I’m not. These little 
varntints have built a culture 
around hydrothermal energy. They 
work metals, generate current, 
understand chemical reactions. 
How they do things I don’t know 
— I’ve bwn a sort of restricted 
guest in the Big Man's town house 
over there. I’ve eaten lily bulbs, 
lichens and a molded mound of 
stuff, not identified but savory, out 
of a polished stone dish. I’ve drunk 
cool water from a fountain. I’ve 
slept on a mat as soft as down and 
they pinched my gun while I 
napped. They knew well enough 
what it was.” 

“How did you find the caverns? 
What clues did you have? Why 
didn’t you let me know?” 

“It’s a long story,” Pegleg said. 
“Right now we’d better be giving 
due deference to his nibs there. 
Call him Yahweh, call him Zeus, 
call him anything you want, but 
he’s the big black he-coon of this 
whole operation and don’t you for- 
get it.” 

Lindy’s cheeks were faintly pink. 
“We noticed,” she said primly. 
Pegleg laugh^ aloud.

''You should see his lady 
friends,'* he said. He has at least a 
dozen. He had them all file past 
me and make polite motions." 

But he didn't faze Lindy. Nobody 
does. 

"Was, by any chance, Aphrodite 
among them?" she inquired 
sweetly. "1 have unfinished busi- 
ness with her." 

"You know," Pegleg said, 
"she just might have been. There 
was one — Oh, oh, what's bugging 
him?" 

Old Zeus had turned his back 
on us. He made a series of motions 
to the nearest coon, which made 
the gesture of respect and darted 
for the portal of the celestial Palace 
— if that was what it was. 

The shadow of the scoutboat 
drifted across again. Zeus watched 
it carefully, almost reflectively. It 
was easy to see that he didn't quite 
know how much he might risk with 
us. But I sensed that he would be 
happy if we would just go away. 
He said as much. He included us 
all in a wave of a hand, then pointed 
to the scoutboat. 

"Here's your hat," Lindy in- 
terpreted. "Nice to have seen you. 
Goodbye." 

"Not my. hat exactly," Pegleg 
said. "Look." 

She was even more spectacular 
than her lord and master and she 
walked with a conscious pride. She 
was a glistening, glossy white. 
When she came closer we could see 
that the wide eyes were pink. They 



blinked continually in the strong 
lingt. She held both hands out 
before her gingerly and on the pink 
palms lay Pegleg's laser gun. 

"He sent for the gun," Pegleg 
conjectured. "He doesn't want us 
to have any reason to stick around. 
But it may have been her idea to 
bring it herself. She wanted to see 
you closeup." 

"You're guessing," I said. 

"Sure. But she watched me a lot 
in there. She does as she pleases. 
She's special. In fact, she's — " 

"Aphrodite?" Lindy was gleeful. 

Pegleg grinned. "Could be." He 
bent to take his gun from the 
small outstretched hands and 
gravely made the gesture of 
respect. Lindy and I imitated him. 
The goddess favored us with a 
slow, regal stare, then ifiade a 
gracious motion. She turned and 
grasped the black hand of her 
big consort, cuddled against him. 
They Walked away from us, back 
along the lane through the sea of 
their subjects, making gracious 
gestures as they went. They did 
not look back. 

"Aphrodite's secret," Lindy 
murmured. "Is that all there is to 
it? Why, I've known that all 
along." 

I put my arm around her. 

"It's the worst-kept secret in the 
universe," I said, "and the male 
doesn't live who isn’t glad." 

I SUGGESTED it and Pegleg 
agreed that it was a good idea —

so we dropped magnetic grapples 
around the jeep, pulled it up and 
secured it tightly against the belly 
of the scoutboat. Then we cruised 
back along the chain of caverns, 
cameras recording the whole 
remarkable route. We watched 
and talked. Pegleg recounted his 
adventures. They were interesting, 
but, once explained, not too un- 
usual. They are not pertinent here. 
He has put them on record in 
complete detail. {ISC Annals, 
Vol. 89. The Log of the Stardust. 
A. D. 2123.) 

We recognized that our chances 
of learning much more of the 
technology of the coon-people 
were not good. The details of how 
old Zeus managed the mechanics 
of the clouds were not likely to be 
known. We could have tried. But 
International Space Council ruling 
was specific on the point. No 
interference with the activities of 
an aware species. We were re- 
stricted to what our sensors could 
tell us. We could only learn what. 
Not how. If we had been invited — 
but we weren’t. Zeus had made 
that very plain. 

Still,. I was satisfied. Like every 
successful race Td encountered, 
this one had solved the basic 
problems. They had space and 
they used it well. They had built 
predation into their life scheme, so 
that their numbers would not be- 
come too great and so that the 
cleverest and the strongest would 
survive. And they had authority, a 



godhead, and they respected and 
obeyed it. 

The influence of their ruling 
deities could have extended far 
beyond their own species. The 
mysterious cloud forms of the 
mighty mountain certainly must 
have affected all living things that 
could see and realize their strange- 
ness. I didn’t know that there were 
such, but there could have been. 

The scoutboat nosed out of the 
entrance canyon and fiashed along 
the side of the range, homing on 
the mother ship. The great massif 
of Mount Olympus lay dead ahead, 
seeming even more magnificent and 
overpowering after our time in the 
caverns. And as we approached, the 
cloud banks spread, took on color 
and swirled even faster until the 
summit seemed wrapped in a 
whirling rainbow. There had never 
been such a display before. 

“Is it a threat, a salute or a 
warning?” Pegleg mused. “One 
thing is sure — it’s meant for us.” 

“There’s no menace in it,” Lindy 
said. “I seem to feel that it’s just 
making a statement, just remind- 
ing us.” 

“Of what?” I asked. 

“Of an obvious fact. I think 
Browning said it many years ago 
much better than I ever could.” 

“I’m shy on, Browning,” Lsaid. 

My wife looked upward at the 
majestic mountain, and smiled 
as she quoted softly:

Airs right with this world . •

T his is the story of two people 
and how three of them died. 

By and large, they were pretty 
nice people. 

But it’s not a very nice story. 

« » # 

“I’ve come to buy some anger,” 
called up the too-young man. He 
sat himself down on a metal saw- 
horse and waited. 

“Indeed?” replied the man work- 
ing up and across from him. 

“Indeed,” answered the too- 
young man. 

The gentleman working across 
from the too-young man and his 
metal sawhorse was engaged in 
an anomaly. He was repairing a 
boat. This in itself was not terribly 
unusual. It was a common enough 
activity in boatyards. But he was 
driving metal pinions into the 
boat’s hull with a hand-held ham- 
mer. This, instead of using an 
automatic arm. 

What was more, the hull of the 
craft appeared to be made of 
natural celluloid materials instead 
of plasticine, metalloy, or ferro- 
sponges. This ship was not new. Its 
hull was badly in need of a new coat 
of paint. 

From the back the man did not 
seem especially arresting. This 
impression changed when he 
paused, straightened and turned 



on his ladder to face the other. 

He stood slightly over average 
height but seemed taller. Leonine, 
well built, lithe. The lines in his 
face seemed put there by a drunken 
cartographer. Each led to some 
strange valley, forbidden city or 
unfathomable abyss of the soul. 

For all of that he was not ancient. 
The streaks of black in his other- 
wise iron-gray hair were plentiful 
and not the product of cosmetics. 
In back the hair was gathered into 
a single pigtail by an odd arrange- 
ment of leather bindings. A single 
solid-gold ring pierced his left ear. 
He had thick gray eyebrows that 
had been intended for a much 
larger man. They shaded equally 
gray eyes. His nose was long and 
slightly hooked. His mouth and 
lips were thin and clenched tightly. 
His whole expression was full of 
star space and vinegar. 

“What makes you think I could 
sell you anger, feller me lad?” 

“You are the man they call Saw- 
bill,” said the too-young man. It 
was not a question. 

“I’m the man some call Sawbill. 
I’m often called other things and 
many of them are better. Some are 
worse. Sawbill will do.” 

Facing Sawbill, the too-young 
man was not all that young. The 
gulf between them, though, was one 
that some people might have called 
age.

H IS metallic red jumpsuit 
flashed in the morning sun. 
“Then you’re the one I want, all 
right. 1 am not without resources. 
Or brains. I’ve checked on you 
thoroughly. Oh, very carefully, 
very quietly. You needn’t worry at 
all.’’ 

“I wasn’t. But go on.’’ Sawbill 
was rummaging through a small 
keg of metal pinions, variously 
shaped and sized. 

“You weren’t easy to locate — 
I’ll give you that. But I knew how 
to find you. It’s all a matter of 
asking the right question in the 
right places. And if you have 
money and know a few people in 
expedient locations — on the Port 
immigration board, for example — 
you can find out just about any- 
thing. I want to make a purchase, 
Sawbill.” 

The boat had a low-lying central 
cabin. A bird thing perched on the 
edge of it. The bird’s rainbow-hued 
crest bobbed up and down like a 
metronome. Its tail was of bright 
golden feathers and the rest of it 
was dull, crushed, velvety gold. 
The thing fluttered down to land on 
Sawbill’s right shoulder. Dipping 
and bobbing, it surveyed the new 
arrival. The rainbow crest feathers 
flashed in avian Morse. 

The too-young man stared with 
interest at the bird-thing. He was 
no ornithologist, not even an 



amateur. But he was well read. 
Enough to know that this bird 
was not native to Thalia Major. 
(It might have come from Thalia 
Minor, but he doubted it be- 
cause. .) 

“Well, feller me lad, who wants 
to buy anger — what’s your 
moniker?” 

“Moniker?” 

“Handle. Wing. Name. Pseudo- 
corporeal psychic verbal inculca- 
tion. What have you been 
conditioned to call yourself?” 

“Jasper Jordan. And it’s my real 
name, not an alias. See, I have no 
desire to hide things from you. I 
want this all to be very open. 
That’s a fascinating pet you 
have.” 

Sawbill carefully aligned a nail, 
drove it home with two solid, 
short raps from the hammer. He 
spoke without pausing in his work 
or looking back. 

“It’s a pim-bird from Tehuante- 
pec. The things are sacred to the 
Indians who inhabit the planet’s 
two continents. They are called 
pim-birds for convenience. Of the 
natives — not of the birds, who have 
nothing to say in the matter. Their 
real names are much longer and

of the sun. and flows from there. 
This particular pim-bird sup- 
posedly contains the soul of the 
great emperor Lethan-atuan, who 
— depending on which legend you 
prefer to believe — at one time ruled 
with the most beautiful Queen 
Quetzal-ma half this galaxy or a 
clust6r of three small islands off the 
coast of the continent Col. Just 
now it happens to be hungry. It is 
said by the Indians that if the souls 
of the emperor and his queen are 
ever reunited, they will once again 
rule the galaxy. Which is one rea- 
son the natives permitted me to 
take him off-planet. They rather 
like their present system of rule and 
frown on the idea of long-dead 
emperors returning.” 

H e turned and pointed the 
hammer at Jordan. “So you 
want to buy anger, hmm? What 
kind of anger?” 

“There are different kinds?” 
Sawbill picked up another couple 
of nails. “Different kinds? There 
are as many different kinds as there 
are foolish young men in the uni- 
verse. There’s uncertain anger, 
which is dark pits filled with thorns. 
There’s jealous anger, which is 
honey and syrup all blended to- 
gether and spoiled. There’s the 
anger of unhappiness, which is the 
texture of polished chalcedony. 



There’s the anger of helplessness, 
which is like sour milk to a babe. 
There’s the anger of ignorance, 
which is the space betweert the 
stars. And the anger of creative 
genius, which is the grandest anger 
of them all and more than the sum 
of any two others. But I can’t sell 
it to you because I’m always well 
out of it.” 

“That’s not the kind I want,” 
said Jasper Jordan. “I have money 
and I’m not offensive to look upon. 
I need something to boost me down 
the road a bit. To activate the navi- 
gational gyro in my spirit. To move 
me. 

“Then you don’t need anger; you 
need a psychiatrist,” Sawbill re- 
plied evenly. 

“I don’t want to change the way 
1 feel. I want to indulge in it, to 
glory in it. I didn’t come for what 
1 need. I came for what 1 want. 
What I want is anger. Good, 
strong, biting, cleansing, wave- 
breaking, glass-shattering anger. 
The mate of hate. Seven-league- 
boot anger. Do you understand?” 
He was not quite pleading. 

“Why, surely,” said Sawbill, 
driving home another nail. “That’s 
called righteous anger and I always 
keep plenty of that in stock. Come 
aboard.” 

Jasper Jordan followed Sawbill 
up a small boarding ladder and 
into the bowels of the old sloop. 



THE EMOMAN 



53 




The pim-bird, which might have 
been an emperor at one time — and 
then again, might not — looked 
down at them and whistled: Ee- 
kwfoo, ee~kwoo, ee-kwo-hoo. , 



J ASPER JORDAN seated him- 
self in an undisciplined old 
chair in the spacious central cabin. 

“You wait there,” Sawbill said 
softly, “while I get what you want.” 
He disappeared forward. 

Jordan looked around. The decor 
was esotei;ic — indeed, eccentric. 
Most of the furnishings were made 
from natural woods. Some were 
dark-grained and highly polished, 
others as brown as raw bacon. 
For sheer color chromoplate had 
them beat hollow. For tactile 
beauty it was no contest. 

The chair in which he sat was 
worlds removed from the late- 
model automatic fluxator in his 
office, the one that molded itself 
to every contour of his body. But 
somehow this collection of springs 
and stuffing flattered his backside 
quite well. 

Sawbill returned. He sat down 
opposite Jordan and placed seven 
tiny capsules on the table between 
Hhem. Each was clearly numbered. 
Jordan leaned forward. 

“As you can see, there are seven 
pills,” began Sawbill. “They are 
to be taken in sequence, an hour 



apart. No closer than that, time- 
wise. A thousand credits apiece. 
You have your card and meter with 
you?” 

Jordan nodded. He reached into 
a pocket, brought out both. After 
making the necessary adjustments 
he handed the card to Sawbill. 

“What happens after I’ve taken 
them all?” 

“An hour after you’ve taken the 
seventh pill you’ll have thirty-six 
t-standard hours of what you want. 
That I promise you.” Sawbill reg- 
istered the exchange of credit on 
his own battered cardmeter, 
hs^nded the card back to Jordan. 
Then he sat back in his chair and 
took out a pipe. He began stuffing 
it with tobacco. 

Jordan reset his card while Saw- 
bill spoke. “If anyone should ask, 
you’ve never seen me before and 
you never will again.” Jordan 
didn’t look up. “You will have the 
anger to enforce the drive to do 
what it is you desire to do. Pro- 
vided you don’t run into someone 
with a stronger reserve of the 
natural stuff than what I’ve given 
you. Most unlikely that there is 
anyone on this planet who can 
resist the force those seven cap- 
sules are going to put in your head. 

“You’re a peaceable-seeming 
young fellow. Those are usually 
the types who seek me out.” 

“Mine is a case of a strong 



54 



IF 




emotion seeking a stronger one,” 
muttered Jordan. He pulled out a 
small quartz vial and carefully 
deposited the pills in it, one by 
one. 

Sawbill leaned forward suddenly. 
He put a gnarled hand covered with 
gray fuzz on Jordan's slimmer, 
smoother one. He stared hard and 
searchingly into the other’s eyes. 

“You’ve no idea what 
you’re getting into, feller me lad. 
Before you go 1 want to know what 
you intend these capsules for. 1 
want to know why you want them. 
I want to know the details. I want 
the ramifications, the exigencies, 
the history you call up your desire 
from. I want all that before I let 
you go.” 

“Well,” Jordan began uncer- 
tainly, “there is a woman—” 

“Ah,” said Sawbill, removing 
his hand and sitting back. “That 
will do.” 



T ^HE hull of the sloop had been 
repaired, sanded and refinished 
to be a^ smooth as the waves it 
would slide over. Now it was re- 
ceiving a new coat of fresh, resis- 
tant red polymer. Thalia Major had 
performed another couple of 
pirouettes on its axis. Thalia Minor 
had, too. But, of course, that didn’t 
matter, because. 

A tall young man arrived in the 



boatyard. He asked a few pointed 
questions and paid a few small 
bribes. He was very composed. 
Soon he was looking up at Sawbill. 
Sawbill was leaning over the back 
of the boat, painting the rudder. 
He used a brush, not a sprayer. 

“Are you the one they call Saw- 
bill, who sells emotions?” asked 
the tall young man composedly. 

“Impossible,” replied Sawbill 
sadly, pausing in his painting. 

“I’m Terence Wu,” said the tall 
young man. He was elegantly 
dressed in a black-and-white semi- 
formal suit. He wore his straight 
black hair in an Iroquois cut — a 
wide bushy brush ran down the 
center of his skull. He had high 
cheekbones, a wide grin and small 
black eyes. Judging by the ring on 
his left hand, a ring that had been 
cut from a single large sapphire 
and caught the light of the sun like 
a siren, he also had a great deal of 
money. 

“1 want to buy some anger,” 
said the tall young man. 

“What kind of anger?” Sawbill 
asked, returning to his painting. 
He caught a spot lower down that 
he had missed earlier. 

“The kind of anger that lets you 
slash and cut without hesitation,” 
said Terence Wu tightly. “The 
kind that makes other men look to 
their feet and cats sweat.” The rich 
young man’s hands were tightly 



the emoman 



55 




clenched, nails impressing palms. 
He was most earnest. “The kind 
that the padres do not approve of. 
That kind of anger.” 

Sawbill indicated the ladder. 
“Then come aboard, feller me lad, 
come aboard.” 

Wu relaxed slightly and started 
for the ladder. “Then you have 
that kind of anger?” he asked, 
“Why, surely,” replied Sawbill, 
dipping the brush in a can of clear 
polymer debonder. “That’s the 
anger of revenge and I always keep 
plenty of that in stock.” 

He took another look at the way 
the photon magnet on the man’s 
finger disorganized the light of the 
fading sun. “It will cost you three 
times seven thousand credits, 
feller me lad.” 

“That’s perfectly agreeable,” 
said Wu evenly, stepping onto the 
deck. 

Sawbill indicated the way down. 
“May I inquire why you should 
wish such anger?” 

“Well,” began Wu, hesitantly, 
“there’s a woman — ” 

“Ah!” said Sawbill under- 
standingly. 

“ — and she’s been taken from 
me. I want her back.” 

“Of course,” murmured Sawbill 
as he followed the young man 
down. 

Forward, the pim-bird observed 
the ocean devouring the sun-ball 



and said, Ee-kwoo, ee-kwoo, ee- 
kwoo-hoo. 

H e was stacking the last 
strands of new dylon rigging 
when a voice from below said, 
“Hello.” 

Sawbill looked over the railing. 
The too-young man stood below. 
Jordan’s face was pale, haggard, 
worn. His suit, blue this time, was 
badly rumpled, as was his manner. 

“Hello on board,” he said rather 
shakily, evidently not seeing 
Sawbill. 

“Evening,” said Sawbill. 

“Look— I know I promised not 
to see you again, but I’ve got to 
talk to you.” 

“Do you?” asked SawbiU, turn- 
ing back to his waxing. He dipped 
a hand in the pot of wax and con- 
tinued running the new line through 
his fingers. “But I don’t have to 
talk to you.” 

/‘Dammit to hell!” came the 
whining yelp from the ground. 
“You got me into this. You’ve got 
to help me. Please.” The voice 
paused. “You’ve got to sell me 
another dose!” 

“I don’t have to sell you any- 
thing,” Sawbill replied quietly. 
He stopped at a section of line that 
seemed a little frayed, gave it an 
extra coat of wax. 

“1 can make trouble for you — ” 
“So can a bumblebee — ” Sawbill 



56 



IF 




sighed— “if his coordinates in re- 
lation to the center of the universe 
do not coincide with mine. But 
come on board and I’ll listen to 
you.” 

Jordan climbed on board. He 
was panting heavily. His visage 
was not a comforting thing to look 
upon. His face was dirty. He wiped 
absently at a particularly greasy 
spot under one eye. The gesture 
had the effect of redistributing the 
muck evenly across his cheek. He 
slumped into the pilot’s seat behind 
the many-spoked wheel and 
groaned. 

“I’ve had other things on my 
mind,” he'^aid. 

“Were you satisfied with what 
you paid for?” Sawbill asked. 

For a moment Jordan seemed to 
brighten. A combination of feel- 
ings, none of them holy^ came into 
his eyes. 

“Yes. It was everything you 
promised. But afterward — why 
couldn’t you have given me a 
stronger dose, one for longer than 
thirty-six hours?” 

“I gave you the maximum for a 
person of your type.” 

“How do you presume to know 
what ‘type’ 1 am?” Jordan asked 
belligerently. 

Sawbill looked up from his wax- 
ing. “If rd given you a stronger 
dose or told you to take the seven 
at slightly shorter intervals you 



would have been harmed — you 
might even have died.” 

“I don’t believe you.” 

Sawbill shrugged and went on 
with his waxing. 

After several minutes Jordan 
pleaded, “What can I do?” 

“Don’t beg, don’t cry and don’t 
whine. I could sell you another 
kind of emotion that would cure 
those tendencies, too. But you 
would resist. So tell me what hap- 
pened. Why do you find it neces- 
sary to acquire more anger than is 
good for a man at one time?” 
“There’s this girl — ” began 
Jasper Jordan. 

“That’s the substance, the body, 
the core, the hub of the thing,” said 
Sawbill. “Now supply me the tin- 
sel, the sprinkles on top of the 
sweetcakes, the things that meta-. 
morphose your need into leeches.” 
“She’s the most beautiful girl on 
Thalia Major.” 

“Not in the universe?” 

“Don’t mock me. 1 don’t know 
the universe. I only know Thalia 
Major. And Minor, of course, but 
that doesn’t matter. We were in 
love—” 

“How long have you known 
her?” 

“Three weeks,” Jordan said 
defiantly. When Sawbill did not 
comment he continued. “Every- 
thing was fine. We were going to 
be married.” 



the EMOMAN 



57 




^'Did she finally agree to marry 
you?” 

'Mt went without saying. As 1 
said — everything was fine until 
several days ago. Then I found out 
she was seeing another — man, I 
suppose I must call him. She didn't 
deny it. She admitted she was meet- 
ing this putrid, low. I couldn't 
understand why. But 1 couldn't 
convince her to break it off. He 
had hypnotized her. I'm a very 
mild, you might even say a tame, 
individual. I didn't have the force 
of personality to confront him. 
We're all very civilized here on 
Thalia Major.'' 

“Yes,” said Sawbill encourag- 
ingly. 

“I just wanted to warn him off, 
to tell him to leave us alone. Not 
to confuse her any more. So I 
came to see you. Everyone knows 
about you Emomen — even if you 
are hard to find.” 

“We like it that way.” 

“Well, the beginning went just 
as I had hoped — exactly as I had 
imagined it would. Better, even. 
I was a terror — although I don't 
remember the details very well. 
I'm afraid. I completely over- 
powered him spiritually and 
mentally. He couldn't take it. 
He vowed never to see her again. 
And he meant it. I could tell. I 
was irresistible. Then — yesterday — 
he confronted me in my office. We 



had a terrible row. He was a mad- 
man! I had never seen a human 
being behave so. I was reduced to 
—jelly. He was an elemental 
force. I tried to stand up to him, 
but I couldn't. I found myself bab- 
bling apologies for ever having 
looked at Jo-ann. You can't imag- 
ine what it Was like. I've never 
confronted anything like that 
before. Helpless. And he recorded 
the entire thing, the whole humilia- 
ting experience. 

“And then, last night I tried to 
sneak over to see her. To try to 
rebuild myself in her eyes at least 
partially. Praying all the while, of 
course, that 1 wouldn't rrfeet that 
giant, that godlike devil again. I 
saw them taking the lift up to her 
apartment — and went out and got 
drunk. Then it came to me to come 
back here. You've got to give 'me 
something stronger this time — 
something that will last. Something 
that will enable me to push him 
away once and for all.” 

Sawbill finished washing the wax 
from his hands. He sat back against 
the bulk of the cabin. He became 
absorbed in an inspection of the 
rear hatchway. 

After a long while he asked 
bluntly, “Why should I become a 
participant in this? Perhaps he is 
the better man for her than you. 
Maybe matters are best left this 
way.”

IF 




“It’s his father's money that’s 
blinded her! The family name is 
. well, no matter. But the father 
is one of the richest men in Barra- 
gash. 1 work hard — I’m well off, 
yes. But not in that class. 1 can 
compete with him and better hini 
in everything except the matter of 
credit.” 

Sawbill was adamant. “I will 
sell you nothing stronger. I gave 
you your maximum dosage. And 
that’s all you can have.” 

The too-young man was desper- 
ate. “Then at least sell me the 
same, the same seven again. You 
owe me that.” 

Sawbill grunted and wiped his 
hands on his pants. “It will cost 
you double this time.” 

“Yes, yes, anything — ” He was 
like an eager puppy. “I promise — 
if this doesn’t do it I will give her 
up to him. I’ll move to another city. 
Perhaps to another planet. I might 
even go to Thalia Minor. Who 
knows? But in any case I will not 
trouble you again.” 

On a high mast the pim-bird was 
sobbing for the moon. 



S ails furled, the little sloop sat 
on the water. Sawbill had the 
mainsail ready and was preparing 
the spinnaker when the peace- 
forcers came for him. 

The man on the dock was short 



and plump. He had a benignly 
optimistic face and scraggly brown 
hair that was fighting a rear-guard 
action. 

A green aircar waited at the far 
end of the dock. It had the oak tree 
symbol of the peaceforcer em- 
blazoned on its side. Two uni- 
formed men stood against it, 
chatting. 

“Pretty little ship,” said the man 
on the dock. 

“Yes, It is,” said Sawbill. “Used 
not to be. Is now.” He was wrest- 
ling with the sail locker. The pim- 
bird fidgeted and bobbed on his 
shoulder. It moved to the top of his 
head, then dropped down to the 
shoulder again, eyeing the short 
man. 

“I’d like you to come with me 
for a bit, Sawbill. I’m Inspector 
Herrera,” 

“Nice for you, I guess.” 

“Usually it is, but not today.” 

“I was just about to go out for 
a month or so. I’m trying to get 
away from people and civilization 
for a while. A vacation — you 
understand?” 

Herrera nodded. “I do. Really, 
I do.” He seemed honestly sympa- 
thetic. “But I’d still like you to 
come with me.” 

“If I decline?” Sawbill asked, 
straightening. “No doubt those 
gentlemen by your car will hurry 
down here with things short, me- 



THE EMOMAN 



59 




tallic and unesthetic. To persuade 
me?” 

Herrera sighed. “No, Sawbill, 
they win not. You’ve probably 
heard before that we are very civi- 
lized, here on Thalia Major. One 
of those men is a driver — and all 
he is going to do is drive. The 
other is a secretary.” 

“And all he will do is sec?” 

“Please don’t make light of 
this. It’s difficult enough for me as 
it is. I cannot compel you.” 

“Meaning I’m not under arrest, 
right?” 

“As you are well aware I have 
no grounds for an arrest. Wish I 
did. But I suspect you will come 
with me — out of curiosity if for no 
other reason. I will not delay you 
long — a moment or two out of your 
vacation is all I nced.”^ 

Sawbill hesitated. Then he tied 
down the sails and climbed down 
to the dock. He and Herrera started 
toward the aircar. 

“Where are you going to go, 
Sawbill?” 

“The Marragas Islands, then 
south to the Anacapa atolls. I’d 
like to put in there for a bit. I 
understand most of the reefs 
around there are still uninhabited 
and rarely visited. Good fishing, 
too.” 

“So I hear,” said Herrera. “Most 
folk around here go north for their 
vacations. To Three and Ark and 



Jumbles — pleasure towns. Where 
all their surprises can be arranged 
for them. All the entertainment 
galactic ingenuity can provide. 
And build.” 



T here was a lot of blood in 
the room, which was done in 
blue and gold. The red blood con- 
trasted strangely. The electric cur^ 
tains were drawn back, admitting 
the sun. They were for effect only, 
since the glass was fully polarized. 
The sunlight gave added obscenity 
to the stains. 

What was left of the body of the 
girl was sprawled across the back 
of the couch, facing the open win- 
dow. She had been torn apart. Her 
insides were strewn acrCss half the 
room. Her face, Sawbill could see, 
probably had once been pretty, 
possibly even beautiful. 

Terence Wu was also in ^ the 
room. All over it. A bit here, a 
fragment there. Sawbill could 
make out an arm protruding from 
under the couch. Nothing was 
attached to the arm. A leg dangled 
from the mantel over the quaint, 
wood-burning fireplace. 

The corpse of Jasper Jordan was 
in the bathroom, slumped over the 
rim of the sunken oval tub. 

Herrera was watching Sawbill 
closely. 

“Acci)rding to what wje’ve been 



60 



IF 




able to piece together with the 
help of the building computer, 
Jordan broke in some time around 
three in the morning. Probably he 
just wanted to talk to the girl. For 
some reason she had forgotten to 
set her doorseal. When he came in 
he found them on the rug. There, 
in front of the fireplace.” Herrera 
pointed. “He didn’t even try to talk 
to them, is my guess. Could be 
he’d taken something. Blood 
analysis and tissue evaluation show 
the presence of complex hormones 
in his body. Puzzled the lab boys 
for quite a while. They’re not used 
to seeing that kind of stuff.” 
Herrera watched Sawbill steadily. 
“A fast check on Jordan’s credit 
count revealed the recent transfer 
of the rather surprising sum of 
twenty-one^ thousand credits to one 
individual. You.” 

“This whole procedure is quite 
illegal,” injected Sawbill mildly. 

“Oh, to be sure, to be sure,” said 
Herrera. “Our information cannot 
be used in court — and obviously is 
not going to be.” 

“I have tapes of the transaction, 
too.” 

“I’m sure you do,” replied 
Herrera. “And I’ve no doubt it 
was all done with the greatest 
respect for the letter of the law.” 
“Quite.” 

“I’m going to have to compose 
some sort of explanation for the 



faxpax and for relatives. These 
people were no bums. Three 
nominally respected citizens have 
died here. Just for my own infor- 
mation and to satisfy my morbid 
curiosity, what did you sell him?” 
“Anger.” 

“I see. Anger.” Herrera looked 
around and took in the wholesale 
carnage. “A little anger did all 
this?” 

“Ordinarily it would not. You 
must believe that.” 

“Oh, sure. Yeah.” 

Sawbill shrugged. “I agree with 
you. When Jordan walked in on 
Wu and the girl I don’t think he’d 
taken a thing. Knowing the sort 
he was I expected him to try reason 
after what I’d told him.” 

“I’ll bet you did.” 

“I mean that! Otherwise I 
wouldn’t have sold to him. Neither 
man was inherently vicious. I 
warned Jordan enough against 
taking the seven. But when he 
came in and found them making 
love he obviously went berserk. 
The seven integrals of the star 
should be taken an hour apart. 
That’s leaving a quarter-hour 
safety limit, which 1 never mention. 
A half-hour is the real danger 
point. He must have downed them 
all at once. The result is unimagin- 
able to most men. Overwhelming. 
Few minds could handle such an 
abrupt release. He couldn’t. But I

was ct>itect about his innate mental 
control and discipline.'* 

Herrera gestured angrily around 
them. “You call this control?” 
“Yes! He had enough sense left 
to kill himself. He did kill himself?” 
“We took the knife back to the 
lab,” admitted Herrera. 

“What he was undergoing was to 
normal anger as a nova is to a nor- 
mal sun. A less controlled individ- 
ual would have stumbled from the 
room and gone to kill a hundred 
people in an orgy of release.” 

“I don’t understand how any 
drug can boost an emotion like 
that,” murmured Herrera, shaking 
his head. 

“It doesn’t ‘boost’ tffe emotion 
— or add to it or multiply it,” 
Sawbill said. “That’s the common 
mistake everyone makes. They 
don’t consider the other — those 
who don’t want to believe it. The 
drug removes the natural safe- 
guards a man’s mind has built up 
to protect and regulate his natural 
self. It breaks the seal holding air 
in the tank, doesn’t pump more air 
into it. It removed a million years 
of evolutionary barriers man has 
carefully erected to hold back the 
blackness that lives inside him. 
Taken properly it does so in the 
smallest way. It isn’t dangerous, 
just effectively awesome. Few men 
can resist the tiny blot of animal 
self so set free. 



“But when all the safeguards are 
removed, like this. .” 

“1 think I * see,” whispered 
Herrera. 

“May I leave now?” 

“What? Oh, yes, you can go. 
Get out of my sight.” 

Sawbill paused at the door. 
“What about the girl?” 

“How do you mean? Oh, I under- 
stand. What you might expect. She 
was playing one off against^ the 
other. Jordan was a little more 
naive than Wu, I suspect. 1 hope 
she enjoyed it.” Herrera paused. 
Then: “I checked you with Central 
and Customs, hoping 1 could get 
you on illegal entry. No such luck. 
I see you got your doctorate in 
endocrinology from the University 
of Belem. That’s on Terra, isn’t 
it?” 

Sawbill nodded. He was halfway 
out of the room. 

“One other thing,” Herrera said 
hurriedly. “I’ve never met one of 
you before. Tell me, is it true what 
they say about you Emomen?” 
“What do they say about us 
Emomen?” 

“That you haven’t any true emo- 
tions of your own? That you’re so 
tied up in playing God that you’ve 
lost your own capacity to feej? 
That your humanity’s atrophied?” 
“Oh, there’s no doubt about it,” 
said Sawbill. He closed the door 
quietly behind him. #

ISK CENTERS sank wearily 
into his foamer. He reached 
a hand out of the froth to dial a 
cold drink while the suit dissolved 
from his sweaty torso. 

No drink came. Then he re- 
membered. His credit balance was 
down and half his apartment ap- 
pliances were out of service until 
he made a repair of his financial 
situation. 

“I’m too old to be destitute,’’ 
he lamented, still hardly believing I

home — but decided to 
live them right here!

the situation. But he had not been 
too old to lose a gamble to increase 
his fortune— a gamble he had 
been talked into by a hard-sell 
outfit. 

Frustrated, he stepped out, let- 
ting the spume drain away. He 
punched for a new suit, knowing 
that a brave new exterior would 
refresh his spirit. 

The suiter did not produce. 

Fisk stood naked, slowly coming 
to grips with his condition. He had 
never before suffered from mal- 
nutrition of credit and he had 
hardly gotten the feel of it yet. 
There was no clothing in his 
apartment. Why should there be, 
when the day’s attire was always 
conveniently recycled after use? 

He had nothing to wear. 

He was no lean, muscular youth 
who could trot outside in Adamic 
splendor and stare down anyone 
who blinked. When properly suited 
Fisk was portly — bare, he was, 
bluntly, fat. He would not, of 
course, be that way long if he failed 
to find some way to renew his 
credit. 

He had been politely inquiring 
about situations for a gentleman 
with his qualifications — and re- 
ceiving tacit demurrals. Hunger 
would very shortly put an end to 
that. It was past time to hustle out 
and get a job. If he could only 
figure out how. 



He punched for the newsfax 
wants ads and was relieved to see 
the paper slide into the hopper. As 
long as he could communicate he 
could function. 

Quickly he eliminated the ads 
obviously intended for women, for 
youth and for specialists. The 
economy was in one of its perennial 
recessions and there were few 
promising entries for the un- 
trained. The main field available 
to him was sales. 

Fisk winced. He had been re- 
duced to his present circumstances 
by a salesman. But the episode had 
certainly been a kind of experience. 
Why couldn’t he himself sell a 
legitimate product? 

But as he read more closely he 
discovered that sales, too, de- 
manded specialization. He could 
not afford even the nominal six- 
week hiatus for insurance train- 
ing — he needed a credit balance 
now. He could hardly peddle 
household machinery when the 
first requirement was to purchase 
the demonstrator models. He 
could not even go for a preliminary 
interview in this present dishabille. 
And he absolutely refused to go 
into illicit land sales. 

The remaining offerings were 
scant, and not particularly 
enticing. Artificial Manure, no 
exp. req. That stank! Artistic 
Photography, Special Interest,

50% comm. No — he was not ready 
to peddle pornography. Intangible, 
must travel. No doubt that sales- 
man had to travel — when his 
intangible product turned out 
also to have intangible value. 

I N THIS morass one item 
snagged his wandering eye 
and hauled it back. Call collect. 
No product, no requirement, just' 
call the number. 

Well, whoever ran that one 
understood Fisk’s desperation. 
He could apply there even if his 
phone credit stalled. So he punched 
the number, collect. 

To his slight surprise the call 
was accepted. A nervous-looking 
middle-aged woman appeared on 
the screen. She looked at him 
sharply. “Yes?” 

“My name is Fisk Centers. I’m 
interested in employment. Your 
ad—’" 

“I know what the ad says,” she 
snapped. “If this is your idea of a 
joke at our expense — ” 

Fisk belatedly remembered that 
he was unclothed. He had been so 
preoccupied by his predicament 
that — well, too late now. Honesty 
was always the best and only policy. 
“I’m— broke. My suiter’s been 
interdicted. I need a credit balance 
in a hurry — as you can see. I shall 
be happy to provide my identity 
code if you wish to verify — ” 



She smiled fleetingly. “I see. The 
position is open. Expenses and 
commission. If you qualify.” 

“I have to tell you I’m fifty and 
untrained in sales. I suffered a 
business loss — ” 

“Oh? What kind? If you were 
rolled — ” 

“1 bought into Mars, Inc. 
Limited, I mean. Mars, Limited. 
Ten lots in Elysium Acres. Cash.” 
She whistled. “They say one’s 
born every minute, but your kind 
comes only once a week. You 
lost—” 

“ — the shirt off my back,” Fisk 
finished, trying to smile. 

“At least,” she said, eying him 
again. “When can you report?” 

“1 beg your pardon?” 

“You want a job, don’t you?” 
“Oh.” Fisk had been so well 
braced against turndown that he 
was hardly prepared. “As soon as 
I get dressed. Uh — ” 

“We’ll call it a business 
expense,” she said. “Have a suit 
on us, Mr. Centers.” And the 
OPERATIVE light flashed on the 
suiter. 

“But I don’t even know your 
business,” he protested feebly as 
he hastened to the unit. 

“Mr. Johns will explain all that 
at the office.” She paused. “You 
can work with nonwhites?” 

“I pride myself on my inflexible 
nonbigotry.” 



66 



IF 




"'But you understand that a 
certain discretion may be 
necessary.” 

“I can keep my mouth shut.” 
He was familiar enough with 
middle-class values to realize 
that this constituted a pretty com- 
pelling agreement. He could take 
the job or reject it, but he could 
not talk about it elsewhere. 

She smiled again, this time with 
genuine warmth. ”Mr. Centers, 
I think you’ll do very well with our 
organization.” 

F isk was met at the office by a 
hard-looking young man. 
”rm Chic Johns, procurement. 
You’ll be on sales, of course. Know 
anything about the adoption 
racket?” 

“Nothing. I—” 

“Good. We’ll tell you all you 
need to know. We sell babies.” 

“I don’t think I understand.” 
Johns appraised him synically. 
“Right. You look like a business- 
man and you talk like one. We 
like that. Just remember — we don’t 
gab about business matters to third 
parties. You take the client’s 
order and deliver the body and 
collect the cash. We do the rest. All 
in strict privacy. Right?” 

“But 1 understood it was 
against the law to assign a 
monetary value to — ” 

” “It’s like this. Centers. The 



state agencies charge for costs, 
always inflated, which is really the 
same thing as selling for a profit. 
Thousand dollars minimum for a 
live body. They make their bundle, 
never you fear. But they’re choosy 
as hell. No black on white or yellow 
on black — know what 1 mean? If 
the client balks they find him 
"unqualified’ and he’s on the 
blacklist and can die childless for 
all they care — he’s out. Lots of 
good potential parents get hung up 
that way. So it’s up to us private 
concerns to fill the vacuum. We 
don’t ask questions — we don’t 
have restrictions. Client tells us 
what he wants and we get it for a 
price— just like any other 
business.” 

Fisk found this hard to as- 

\ 

similate. “But these are human 
beings. Surely you wouldn’t place 
an innocent baby with unfit 
parents.” 

Johns shrugged. “I wouldn’t. 
But my end is procurement, not 
placement. You’re the one who 
decides on parental qualifications. 
But remember, we don’t have the 
staff to do a damn security check 
on every family that wants a child. 
And who’s to say who’s fit or unfit? 
Some pretty rough people are 
mighty good to their kids — and 
some pillars of society, the kind 
the state agencies like, are raising 
speed demons, not to mention the

real addicts. Our record is at least 
as good as the state’s when you 
consider the family, not the class — 
and we deliver much faster. So we 
just charge enough to discourage 
anybody who’s in it for laughs. 
Would you pay three, four grand 
for a piddling black baby if you 
didn’t mean to take care of it?” 
“No, of course not. But — ” 

“So okay. Here’s the procedure 
book. Take it home, study it today. 
Tomorrow’s your first ass.” 

“Ass?” 

“Assignment. Tomorrow maybe 
you’ll place a poor black baby in 
a rich white home, Centers. Twenty 
per cent commission on the gross. 
Maybe eight hundred dollars for a 
day’s work. Like the notion?” 

“I’ll, er, try my best,” Fisk said 
uncertainly. 

It was a job. 

T he book was far more sophis- 
ticated in language than Chic 
Johns had been, providing elegant 
explanations and justifications for 
private adoption procedures. But 
the man’s callous summary seemed 
essentially correct. State regulations 
were so complex and picayune and 
state agency staffs so overworked 
that many worthy prospective 
parents were unfairly denied 
adoptive children. Many innocent 
babies were forced to grow up in 
impersonal institutions, where 



they soon became so backward as 
to be unadoptaUe. Even a bad 
family appeared, on balance, to be 
a superior environment for a 
child than a good state orphanage. 
A child. needed parents. 

But Fisk, doubly wary after his 
bilking by Mars, Ltd. — accom- 
plished via its plausible sales 
pitch — checked carefully for pit- 
falls. This manual could be 
biased, deliberately distorting the 
state agency picture in order 
to justify the need for an 
intrusion by private enterprise 

He phoned the library informa- 
tion service and verified that state 
institutions were run according to 
strict and basically fair precepts, 
so that orphans were not actually 
deprived — but adoption into fami- 
lies was still preferable. He 
learned that no adoption was legal 
unless court-approved, so that if 
this seeming detail were omitted a 
child could be taken away at any 
time from even the most loving and 
competent parents. The main 
complaint lodged against black- 
market outfits was their frequent 
failure to nail dowp adoptions in 
cQurt. 

The procedure book Chic Johns 
had given him was supposed to 
contain all he needed to know 
about placing a child for adoption. 
Yet it made no reference to the 
court requirement. 



68 



IF 




Fisk reviewed the library 
material carefully. Theoretically 
it was impossible for a baby to be 
adopted without court sanction— 
i.e., via black market. But now 
that he had a notion which lines to 
read between, he saw that there 
were avenues. The problem was 
not the placement, for many more 
people wanted children than the 
supply could accommodate. The 
problem was the acquisition. A 
few babies might be born un- 
recorded — but the overwhelming 
majority arrived in hospitals or 
with sanctioned medical super- 
vision and all of these were 
duly recorded. Once recorded, they 
were in the computerized system — 
the state knew the approximate 
whereabouts of every recorded 
human being. But some officials 
were susceptible to corruption and 
supervisory agencies were chroni- 
cally overworked, so there was 
a practical loophole, for a continu- 
ing siphoning of babies theoreti- 
cally destined for legitimate 
placement. If no one complained 
and no one checked to make certain 
a given baby had arrived, the 
computer’s entry was in fact 
fictitious — sometimes. 

But it would be pretpature to as- 
sume that he had landed in such 
a black-market enterprise, Fisk 
told himself. He had gotten in 
trouble before by jumping to 



conclusions — and he needed the 
job. The court would make its own 
investigation at the time of the 
adoption — and if anything were 
wrong the transaction would be 
avoided. It was the ethical re- 
sponsibility of the placement 
agent — himself — to make arrange- 
ments for such legal blessing. 

A small unease nagged at him 
subliminally, but the thought of 
an eight-hundred-dollar coidmis- 
sion for one day’s work forced 
aside his final doubts. His best 
course was to try to do the job 
honestly before judging it. He 
could always quit once he had 
verified the facts, if that was the 
way it went.

T he woman was back on duty 
in the morning. “All set, 
Mr. Centers?” she inquired over^ 
mounded paperwork. 

“Ready to try,” he said. “I’ll 
need to know a lot more, but I 
should be able to work it out as 1 
^o along.” 

“Good. Here’s your first lead. 
Find out what they want and re- 
port back here. Don’t talk business 
over the phone — we never do that. 
Remember, make no promises. 
Just say you’ll try.” 

That simple! Fisk took the card

she proffered and read it: Michael 
Ormand, with an address in one of 
the newer apartment complexes. 

But why no business over the 
phone? An order was a fairly 
straightforward thing. 

Ormand was a genial muscular 
man of about thirty, with a 
scalped-looking crewcut. Under 
it Fisk detected the inset metal 
contacts of a spaceman. He 
tried not to stare. He knew about 
the brain-to-machine synapses 
used by interplanetary crewmen, 
but had never seen the implants at 
close quarters before. 

“Mars shuttle?” Fisk inquired, 
feeling a twinge. It was foolish 
foj him to resent everything 
connected with Mars, but the 
wound still pained. 

“Venus,” Ormand answered. 
“But I’m through with all that. 
No more shuttling. Going to retire 
now I’ve made my pile. Want a 
family.” 

“That’s what I’m here to 
discuss,” Fisk said with what he 
hoped was the proper note of 
professional encouragement. This 
was easy enough, so far. “May I 
ask what you plan to do now?” 
“It’s none of your business, but 
I’ll tell you. I’ll grow mugwumps.” 
“I beg your pardon?” 
“Mugwumps. Venusian pseudo- 
plants. Very pretty, use no water 
or sunlight, smell like a lemon. 



They’re in big demand here on 
Earth, but I’m not doing it for the 
money. Made my pile already, 
as I said. Challenge, you know. 
Never been cultivated before.” 

Fisk made a mental note to 
look up mugwumps — he had not 
heard the word in this connection 
before. “I see. What kind of child 
were you thinking of adopting? 
"You understand we are a private, 
fee-charging agency. We do our 
best, but we can’t make promises 
— except that we don’t collect 
until we deliver.” 

“Sure. No red tape — that’s what 
I like. I figure a little girl, nine or 
ten. Healthy, you know?” 

“Nine or ten months,” Fisk 
repeated, writing it down. 

“Months? Years! What would I 
want with a squalling baby?” 

“Oh,” Fisk said, nonplused. 
“Sorry. 1 thought — uh — how long 
have you been married?” 

“Married? Spacemen don’t 
marry. What would I want with a 
gold-digging wife?” 

Fisk choked. “Mr. Ormand, 
If you want to adopt — ” 

“That’s why I want to adopt. 
A nice, sweet little girl. Catch her 
before she gets bitchy, train her 
right, you know? Older women are 
unmanageable.” 

“But—” 

“You’re single, aren’t you? You 
know what women are like.” 



70 



IF 




“But you can’t adopt when you’re 
single.” 

Ormand glanced at him in sur- 
prise. “I can’t?” 

“Of course not. Only married 
couples can — ” 

The man smiled. “Oh, that’s the 
agency pitch. Sure. That’s why I 
called you. To cut that bilge. Look, 
you don’t need to beat up the price 
on me. 1 told you I’m loaded. Don’t 
worry about it. Find me what 1 
want and I’ll pay. Within reason. 
I know what the range is for this 
sort of thing. And I’ll give you a 
little bonus on the side for 
prompt service. Fair enough?” 

Fisk was afraid of what would 
come out if he opened his mouth, 
so he kept it closed. Somehow he 
made his exit in good order. 

UqpEN - YEAR - OLD girl? 

X Sure, we can get,” Johns 
said at the office. “That kind’s 
a glut on the market. And he 
won’t quibble on color or price. 
Good show, Centers — I can see 
you’ve got the knack.” 

This was not the response Fisk 
had anticipated. He had supposed 
the sale doomed. “But he’s single.” 
“So?” 

“What about the law?” 

Johns made a face as though he 
had heard a bad word. “What 
about it? Didn’t you read the book? 



Singles can adopt — if they have the 
means to make a good home. And 
this guy does. He’ll bite for five 
grand, wait and see. Grand for you, 
grand for me — and grand for 
business.” 

Fisk felt vaguely nauseated, but 
he didn’t want to imperil his income 
by raising uninformed objections. 
A thousand dollars could go a long 
way in reconstituting his life style. 
“Do you have a ten-year-old girl? 
Uh, in stock?” 

“You think I keep that kind 
packed^ in desk drawers? I’ll 
find one,” Johns said confidently. 
“Just a matter of making the 
connection — and a little quiet 
negotiation. Two days, maybe. 
Don’t you worry about that. My 
end of the business, procurement. 
Just you go out on your next ass 
and see if you can land another 
order to match the first.” 

Fisk retained strong personal 
reservations about this business, 
but he went. As it happened, the 
leads fizzled. Some people merely 
wanted information. Others backed 
off when it came to the point of 
actually ordering a baby. One lady 
seemed to be more interested in 
finding a husband and Fisk barely 
escaped intact. Ormand was right 
— some older women did get 
predatory. Meanwhile, however 
much he might look the part, he 
was not a high-pressure salesman. 



BLACK BABY 



71 




vOn the third day Johns barged 
into the office, hauling along a 
screaming tantrum of a spitfire. 
‘*Got her!” he exclaimed breath- 
lessly, shoving the creature into the 
center of the room and leaning 
against the door. Blood dripped 
from a scratch on his cheek and his 
suit was torn in a couple of places, 
but he was smiling. “What a job!” 
Abruptly the commotion ceased. 
A young girl of indeterminate 
color and culture stood there. 

“Hi,” she said to Fisk, nodding 
her short black tangle of hair 
pertly. “You the sucker?” 

Fisk turned to Johns, dismayed. 
“Surely this isn’t—” 

“Surely this is! Take her to your 
client and get the money. Real 
bargain for him. See those classic 
facial lines? That animal vigor? 
That instant self-control? You 
know the price.” 

Fisk found the moral ramifica- 
tions too fast to contemplate on the 
spot, so he shelved them in favor of 
details. “He — he wants a — a nice 
sweet little girl.” 

“I’m nice and sweet,” the girl 
snarled. “When I want to be.” 
“Would you want to be sweet 
for a man who’ll shell out five 
grand for you?” Johns asked her 
with a half-smile. 

“Five grand?” she exclaimed, 
delighted. “Am I worth^all that?” 
“If you behave. At least until 



the deal’s complete. After that, 
who cares? You’re in.” 

“Yeah, who cares?” she echoed, 
with momentary mischief. Despite 
their manner of entry, Johns and 
the girl appeared to have a certain 
mutual appreciation of each other’s 
motives. 

Fisk had been concerned for the 
welfare of the child, but now he 
suspected that the client was the 
sucker she had implied. Should he 
proceed with this transaction? 

What would he eat if he didn’t? 
He had made no other sales (placed 
no other children, he corrected 
himself), so his commission was 
zero. The office petty cash wouldn’t 
carry him long. Sheer need was 
bruising his scruples. 

“Okay, .Centers — now take her 
away,” Johns commanded briskly. 
“Clean her up and feed her first, 
so she doesn’t snatch. Here are a 
couple of tokens. Play it cool. But 
don’t turn her over until you get his 
payment.” 

F isk took her away, with a 
stop at a refresher booth to get 
her cleaned and dressed for presen- 
tation. He wished he could do the 
same for himself — his home foamer 
had quit the day before and this 
was his fourth day in a one-day 
suit. Only extreme care kept him 
from looking seedy. 

Of course he could always sell 



72 



IF 




one of his Mars lots. But those 
were worth only one per cent what 
he had paid, and he couldn’t bring 
himself to convert that paper loss 
to cash. Marsland might eventually 
improve. 

“What’s your nairie?” he asked 
belatedly as she foamed. 

“Yola. Hey, I’ve never been in 
a public booth before. Neat!” Her 
voice emerged from a speaker be- 
side the entrance. There was no 
vision screen, of course. 

“How did Johns get you?” Fisk 
couldn’t bring himself to use the 
term “procure” in this connection. 

“The usual. 1 was doing time in 
solitary ‘cause I — aw, never, mind. 
The cage was glad to unload me — 
and not for any five grand, either.” 

“The orphanage sold you?” 

“They don’t call it that. Order 
came through the Juvenile Parole 
Agency, which is a legit division of 
Youth Services. But somewhere 
along the way 1 got shunted — and 
here I am.” 

“You mean you were abducted 
from your lawful guardian?” 

“You don-i know much, do you? 
It was just in the paperwork. 
Same thing, I guess. The usual, 
I said.” 

“But how could you be trans- 
ferred from a state institution to 
a — to here?” 

“If I knew I’d know enough not 
to talk about it,” she said uncom- 



fortably. Then she changed the 
subject. “Is it a nice family?” 

“It’s a single man. Spacer.” 

She didn’t respond right away 
and Fisk hardly needed to inquire 
why. Children in institutions 
learned early about life, and the 
spacers were notorious for their 
planetfall orgies. The situation was 
developing into something a far cry 
from the philanthropic service Fisk 
had hopefully anticipated. 

“Well, let’s go,” she said, 
emerging. Fisk had feared she had 
punched some outrageous replace- 
ment outfit, but she was tastefully 
dressed for her age: eleven. She 
was small, looked undernourished 
and not black-skinned, though she 
obviously derived from mixed 
ancestry. She looked tanned on the 
body and the faintly Negroid 
cast about her features was not 
obvious at a casual glance, No 
doubt neither pure black nor pure 
white had wanted her as a baby, 
as neither considered brown 
beautiful. So she was here. 

“So whatcha gaping at?” she 
demanded. 

He guided her* to the fooder 
and inserted the second token. 
“Punch what you want — and make 
sure you have enough to fill up,” 
he advised, hoping she would order 
so much that he would get to abate 
his sudden hunger on the surplus.* 
He had been scrimping on meals. 



BLACK BABY

She looked at him sidelong, 
punched a supersoda and a 
miniature dog biscuit. 

“For you,” she said, proffering 
the latter. 

Fisk was too hungry to be 
properly furious. He chewed on 
the biscuit while shp slurped the 
giant confection noisily. An un- 
limited one-i^itting fooder order 
gone to waste! 

But his con^ience hung on. “Are 
you sure you want to go through 
with this, Yola? A single man — ” 

' “A single — loaded— man. Think 
Tm dumb? Better’n solitary, for 
sure, ril get to see shows, sleep 
late, eat anything I want — ” 

“Then why were you fighting so 
hard when Johns brought you in?” 

“I don't like being told what to 
do.” 

“Do you always throw a 
tantrum when — ” 

“Always. Matter of principle.” 

“That could get you into 
trouble.” 

She contemplated him obliquely 
as the soda drained to vociferous 
dregs. “My middle name. 
Grandad.” 

“Don't call me Grandad.” 

“Don’t tell me what to call 
you — ” she screamed, not stinting 
on the volume. It was amazing how 
far a soprano voice carried. People 
stopped in the street outside to 
look up «iil Fisk fought to keep 



the flush off his face. Then, 
sweetly: “ — grandad.” 

Fisk decided to ignore it. “We 
have ^n appointment, Yola.” 
“Right, Centers,” she agreed 
with continued insolence. But he 
was determined not to let her 
have the satisfaction of his 
reaction. 

M ike ORMAND was pleased. 

“Very nice,” he said, study- 
ing Yola with more critical 
intensity than Fisk thought appro- 
priate for such an interview. He 
half hoped the child would pull an 
instant tantrum and void the 
placement, but for the moment she 
was every inch the demure pre-teen, 
“Here’s your check, sir. Five grand, 
certified.” 

“Just a minute,” Fisk protested. 
“You can’t just— ” 

“Why not, Mr. Centers?” Yola 
asked innocently. She turned to 
Ormand. “May I call you Dad?” 
“Sure, Kid. Go punch yourself 
a soda,” he said amiably. “No 
hard stuff, now.” Then, to Fisk: 
“Don’t worry. I didn’t forget yours. 
1 know how it goes. I made it out 
separately. So your office wouldn’t 
know. Five hundred.” He handed 
over the second check, winking. 

“I’m not talking about that” 
Fisk’s moral anguish was becoming 
tempered by the greed of despera- 
tion. Five hundred would fuel his 



74 



IF 




finances for a couple of weeks. 
“You — you two — you don’t even 
know each other,” 

“What’s to know, Mr. Centers?” 
Yola inquired prettily over her 
soda. This one didn’t slurp — she 
sipped it with delicacy. “Dad’s^got 
a nice layout here, a real home. 
He’s a nice guy.” 

“Yeah,” Ormand agreed. “I’ve 
got what she wants — she’s what 
I want and you’ve got your money. 
So it’s done. We’re all happy and 
thank you. Now toddle off, 
Centers. You’re interfering in 
family business.” 

“Yeah,” Yola echoed almost 
inaudibly. 

They were both reasonably sat- 
isfied, neither being quite the 
bargain the other supposed— and 
Fisk did have the money. Why 
should he object? He had per- 
formed his function. He had a 
thousand-dollar commission com- 
ing for this transaction. Yet he 
balked, feeling like a pimp. 

He said, “We have to complete 
the contract and make arrange- 
ments for the formal adoption. 
There’ll have to be a court hearing 
and — ” 

“A what?” Ormand demanded 
incredulously. Then he caught 
himself. “Oh, sure. I’ll take care of 
that. You don’t need to bother.” 

“I do need to bother,” Fisk 
said, his stubborn streak coming 



into play. “Somebody could take 
her away from you at any time, 
no matter how long — ” 

“Oh, that’s it,” Ormand said, 
seeming relieved. “That’s okay. 
Nothing’s going to happen inside 
of ten days, is it?” 

“Not that I know of. But there 
is no expiration on a counterclaim 
of this nature. If a natural parent 
showed up in five years — ” 

Ormand laughed. “Fat chance. 
They’d never follow where 
we’re going!” 

“Where are we going, Dad?” 
Yola inquired. 

“To Venus, of course. Got my 
one-way passes for the next 
liftoff, just ten days away.” 

Yola spat out a mouthful of 
soda. “Venus!” - ’ 

“Sure, kid. To farm mugwump. 
It only grows onVenus, you know.” 
“But there aren’t any shows on 
Venus!” Yola shrieked as though 
mortally wounded. “No foamers, 
no fooders, no autobeds. It’s just 
a perpetual sandstorm!” 

“Right. Real challenge. Ideal 
for mugwumps and no neighbors 
to butt in, except for the shuttle 
every four months. Great life.” 

“In a spacesuit!” she wailed, her 
anguish intensifying. “All day! 
And the trip there takes six months 
cooped up in an old tin can with 
nothing but nasty ol’ vacuum try- 
ing to get in — ” 



BLACK BABY

“The vacuum doesn’t come in,” 
Ormand said. “The air goes out 
if there’s a leak. And the trip takes 
longer right now because of the 
phase. And it’s getting worse. 
That’s why I have to make a tight 
schedule. The free fall gets to you 
if you stay in space too long, 
speciallly if you’re not used to it.” 
“Free fall?” she repeated 
faintly. “I get sick just in the 
downshaft — ” 

“I don’t understand,” Fisk 
said. “If you’re settling on Venus 
— why are you adopting a girl?” 
“Why do you think he wants a 
girl. Grandad?” Yola asked. 

“Well, it’s a long trip out and a 
rough, lonely life,” Ormand said 
reasonably. “What grown woman 
would sign up for it?” 

“A desperate one,” Fisk said. 
“No other.” 

“Just count me out, Ormand,” 
Yola cried. “I’m no Lolita!” 

Fisk couldn’t resist needling her, 
though he was privately relieved 
about her change of heart. “You 
didn’t object before, Yola.” 

“He wasn’t going to Venus 
before!” 

“I was,” Ormand said. “That’s 
why 1 — ” 

“You stay out of this, child- 
buyer!” she screamed at him. 

“Watch who you’re sassing, kid,” 
he snapped back. His temper was 
about as quick as hers. 



She threw the soda cup at him. 
“I’ll sass anybody I please, you — 
oh!” 



O RMAND had grabbed her and 
was hauling her over his knee. 
He flipped her short skirt up over 
her back. “No daughter of mine 
is going to sass her elders,” he 
said as his hand came down re- 
soundingly on her little posterior. 

Yola screeched incoherently. 
Fisk had some sympathy with each 
party and did not interfere. Yola 
certainly had no reason to like 
Venus, but Ormand was taking the 
kind of firm disciplinary action 
Fisk envied. They were working it 
out. 

Then Yola jackknifed and bit 
the man on the ankle. It was 
Ormand’s turn to exclaim with pain 
and rage. By the time he recovered 
his bearings Yola had scooted 
across the room. 

Fisk had been pleasantly be- 
mused by the suddenness and 
violence of these proceedings, but 
now he stepped between the 
fighters. “I’m afraid this isn’t 
going to work. Here are your 
checks back, Mr. Ormand. Til 
return this girl to the---” 

“Uh-wA!” Yola said. 

“No, you don’t, Centers,” 
Ormand rapped simultaneously, 
slapping the checks to the floor.

IF 




“I don’t have time to get another 
girl. This one’ll be fine once I 
get her broken in.” 

“Go break in your fat head!” 
Yola cried^ casting about for 
something else to throw. 

Fisk caught her by the wrist 
and hustled her out of the apart- 
ment and this time she didn’t object 
to being directed. Ormand charged 
after them, but Yola ducked back 
and tripped him with professional 
dispatch. He sprawled ignomin- 
iously. Fisk wondered just what 
sort of education children obtained 
in state orphanages, for spacers 
were normally sure on their feet. 

He and Yola ran to the exit 
chute and jumped in. She did look 
a little queasy in that brief free 
fall, though several factors could 
account for that. 

The house alarm was already 
sounding as they boarded the 
transport for the office. Ormand 
must have called the police. Fisk 
and Yola were on their way and by 
the time the police net tightened. 

“Let him rant,” Fisk said angrily 
as the capsule popped into its 
vacuum tunnel and accelerated. 
“The adoption was never con- 
summated. He has no call on you.” 
“Good,” she said. “Where are 
we headed now?” 

“To the office. Then Johns will 
return you to the orphanage — or 
wherever you came from.” 



“Not me,” she said. “I hate 
that place.” 

“But you agreed to go back. I 
heard you — in the apartment.” 

“I said uh-ti/r, not uh-AuA, 
Grandad.” 

“You don’t want to go to Venus, 
do you?” 

“No. But I’m not going back in 
local solitary cither,” she said. 

“I don’t see what choice you 
have — unless another client happens 
to be looking for a girl your age. 
And frankly, your spot tantrums 
don’t make you very — ” 

“What do you want to do with 
these?” she asked, interrupting 
him. “They’re made out to you, 
you know.” 

“I’ll just explain the situation at 
the office — ” He stopped, seeing 
what she held. “What are you 
doing with — ” 

“Ormand’s checks?” she said 
innocently. “I figured we might 
need the money so I scooped them 
up while — ” 

“His checks? Yola, that repre- 
sents either stealing or acceptance 
of payment. It gives him a theoret- 
ical basis to — ” 

“To sue?” she inquired with 
mock astonishment. “Gee, you 
could get in bad trouble. 
Centers — ” 

AH vehicles halt in place, the 
capsule loudspeaker said. Stand 
by for inspection .

“No wonder he’s mad,” Fisk 
said as he punched the halt button. 
“I didn’t realize we’d taken his 
money.” 

“Mistake, huh?” she said, look- 
ing at the checks. 

Ill 

S ometimes she was unbear- 
able, but this time she seemed 
genuinely contrite. 

“Bad mistake,” he told her. 

Open vent. The police had con- 
nected a pressurized tube — the 
capsule could not be opened in the 
tunnel vacuum. 

Reluctantly, Fisk pressed the 
OPEN stud. 

“You dope!” Yola cried, slap- 
ping the CANCEL button before 
the machinery functioned. “They’ll 
hang you!” She hit emergency 
ACCELERATION next. 

“What are you doing?” Fisk 
exclaimed as the vehicle shot for- 
ward with a force possible only in 
vacuum, ripping away the police 
tube. 

“Making your getaway, Gran- 
dad,” she said. “No sense having 
you in the hole for theft.” 

“But I was going to return the 
checks and explain — 

“And let me hang?” 

“You have an unduly suspicious 
mind. Once the mistake is clarified, 
nobody will — ” 



“Uh-w/i. Get that uh this time. 
Centers. You aren’t going to re- 
turn that money and void the sale. 
I told you I’m not going back to 
the pen. Not for anything.” 

“Do you mean you are willing to 
let me be charged with resisting 
the police — ^just so you stay out of 
a legitimate orphanage? I can’t 
believe that.” 

“You can’t, huh?” She consid- 
ered for a moment. “Well, would 
you believe kidnaping?” 

“Yola! Of all the ridiculous — ” 

“Or maybe child-molestation? 
My word against yours. Centers. 
Want to see my act?” 

Suspect running. Cut power in 
tunnel. 

Fisk knew how guilty that 
sudden flight made him seem. Why 
would he take Ormand’s money, 
then break out of a routine police 
net? With a sgreaming eleven- 
year-old girl? Yola really could 
hang him. And she was brat 
enough to do it. 

He had once hoped — no matter 
how weakly — that his job would 
benefit his fellow man and make 
people happy. 

“You’re pretty much of a sucker, 
aren’t you,” Yola said as the 
capsule drifted to a lifeless stop. 
“What are you doing in a racket 
like this?” 

“Just being a sucker,” Fisk 
admitted, demoralized. “A Mars- 



78 



IF 




land salesman took me and Tm 
broke.” 

She looked at him as she might 
have at a broken- winged bird. 
“Well, we’re caught anyway. It’s 
nothing personal. Centers. Maybe 
I’d better go back to Ormand. 
He’s the kind of bastard I don’t 
mind scr — ” 

“Yola!” 

“Oh come off it, grandad — you 
have a dirty mind. I mean I can 
always run away before he goes 
to Venus. So he’ll get what he 
deserves — nothing.” 

Her spark of charity was as awk- 
ward as her ruthlessness. “But 
that’s dishonest. If you don’t intend 
to—” 

“All right, sucker. It was only a 
silly notion to get you off the 
hook — ’cause you’re a decent sort 
under all that quaint naivete.” She 
began tearing up her recently 
machined hairdo. “By the time 
they get this kidnap/molestation 
rap untangled, Ormand’ll be on 
Venus, you’ll be in the clink for 
trial and I’ll be a ward of the 
court — where maybe I can finagle 
a better deal for number one. 
Will that make you feel better?” 
Fisk saw that to attempt to 
reason with this gutter child was 
futile. The police were already 
applying another pressure-exit to 
the capsule. He would simply 
have to present his case and hope 



the police considered all aspects 
of the situation before doing any- 
thing irrevocable. Certainly he 
was not going to capitulate to this 
attempted extortion. 

“You’re so cubical you’re a 
tesseract,” she exclaimed. “Look, 
Grandad, you’re a nonsurvival type. 
If you’ll just shut up and let me 
handle it I can — ” 

The capsule opened. “Crawl out 
in a hurry — you’re blocking 
traffic,” a police voice called 
down the tube. 

Fisk’s mind was still on Yola’s 
offer to complicate things yet 
further. “Never — ” he cried to her. 

N aturally the police 
misunderstood. A sleepdart 
buzzed along the tube like a 
vengeful fly and pinked Fisk on 
the sweaty forehead — and he 
found himself standing insecurely 
before a tall desk in the police 
station. Yola was beside him and 
Ormand had a chair nearby. The 
law could be devastatingly efficient 
when it snared the innocent. 

“ — serious charge. Kidnaping a 
minor from a private apartment,” 
the lieutenant behind the desk 
said as the dart nullifier took 
effect. “Do you understand you 
have the right to consult counsel 
before making your statement?” 
“I’m sure I can explain every- 
thing without the necessity of 



BLACK BABY 



79 




counsel,” Fisk said hastily, know- 
ing that the police preferred dis- 
patch. ‘This girl—” 

“What he means is,” Yola inter- 
jected, “we were just going to the 
court to arrange for the adoption.” 
“You wereT’ Ormand asked, 
surprised and, oddly, not particu- 
larly pleased. “I thought—” 

“We were not!” Fisk said. “I 
was taking her back to — ” 

Yola kicked him. “To fetch the 
adoption papers,” she said. 

The lieutenant turned to 
Ormand. “What’s this about 
adoption? You told us your 
daughter had been kidnapped.” 
Ormand hesitated. “I — ah — 
maybe there was a misunderstand- 
ing. I’ll just take her home now.” 
He came up and grabbed Yola’s 
arm. 

“Get your filthy paw off me!” 
she screamed automatically. “You 
can’t tell me what to do, you 
child-beater!” 

The lieutenant made a note. 
“Child-beating.” 

Fisk had a certain grudging 
sympathy for Ormand, who 
still thought a simple spanking or 
two would bring Yola into line. 
He would learn. 

The desk phone lighted. “For 
you,” the lieutenant said to Fisk, 
turning the screen to face him. 

It was Johns. “What’s this 
about your being arrested?” Johns 



demanded. “We run a respectable 
outfit here. You’re fired. Centers.” 

“But I’ve still got the child. The 
adoption can’t — 

Johns screwed up his face in 
perplexity. “Child? Adoption? I 
don’t know what you’re talking 
about. Have you been messing 
around with something on the 
side?” 

Fisk began to see what sort of 
a bag he was to be left holding. 
Naturally Johns wouldn’t admit 
in the hearing of the police to 
dealing in black-market babies. 

“But—” 

“Just get our eighty per cent to 
us pronto and we’ll forget the 
embezzlement charge,” Johns 
finished, clicking off. 

The policeman made another 
note, “tobezzlement.” He looked 
up. “Are you sure you don’t need 
an attorney?” 

“This is all a misunderstand- 
ing — ” Fisk felt hopeless. If he 
returned the checks to Ormand, 
Johns would charge him with 
embezzlement of company funds. 
If he kept them, Ormand had him 
on kidnaping. Both men were 
ruthless enough to hang the inter- 
mediary. And Yola had not yet 
even started on her child-molesta- 
tion act. 

< i ^^HERE’S funny business 
X somewhere,” the lieutenant 



80 



IF 




said thoughtfully. “Damn funny," 
He turned to Ormand. “This is a 
nonwhite child and you’re a white 
spacer. She can’t be your natural 
issue.’’ 

“Sure I could,’’ Yola said, keep- 
ing her options open. “My mother’s 
black and I won’t say what business 
she’s in, but it’s near the spaceport. 
She—’’ 

“Yeah,’’ Ormand agreed, mani- 
festly not pleased but riding with 
the inevitable. “You know how it 
is.’’ 

“How old are you, Ormand?’’ 
the lieutenant snapped. 

“Twenty-nine. That’s why I’m 
retiring. You have to call it quits 
after thirty.’’ 

“And you?’’ he said to Yola. 

“Eleven.’’ 

The lieutenant turned back to 
Ormand. “And how old is the 
minimum for a space license?’’ 

“Twenty-one." Then Ormand 
saw the trap. “Well, maybe 
before I — ’’ 

“Looks like a black-market 
operation to me," the lieutenant 
said. “Five to two you’re an 
ineligible parent. Single.- with no 
permanent home — and you know 
you can’t take an underage child 
offplanct— ’’ 

“No, no!" Ormand cried, turning 
pale even for a spacer. 

“Sq you paid a fat check to a 
shyster outfit to sneak through 



a black baby I know damn well 
you weren’t going to any court for 
adoption, whatever you told the 
child." 

Ormand fell back, whipped. 
Without seeming to take a breath 
the lieutenant pounced on Fisk, 
who had just started to relax. 
“And you. Centers. You represent 
that black-market racket, squeez- 
ing human blood out of both ends. 
You’re selling an innocent ward of 
the state to an ineligible child- 
beater, embezzling on the side and 
maybe kidnaping, too — " 

“Yeah," Yola said, enjoying 
this. “Don’t forget child moles — " 
“And to top it off the brat’s a 
little bitch nobody can handle 
without a whip in one hand and a 
prayer book in the other." 

“Yeah," Fisk and Ormand 
agreed together. Yola glared. 

The lieutenant smiled know- 
ledgeably. “In short, three fine fat 
fish on the line, suckers all, tugging 
the hooks into each other. As if I 
didn’t have important cases to 
handle in my off-days! Now are 
you three going to work out your 
own squabble or you want me to 
do it for you?" 

Yola and Ormand both quailed, 
but Fisk had an inspiration. 
'‘Lieutenant, if you will permit us 
a moment to confer privately — " 
“Sure, I’ll wait," the officer 
said sardonically. “Thirty seconds." 



BLACK BABY 



81 




TTERE — now!” Fisk snapped 
XJ. at the other two, pulling 
them into a huddle. He had never 
before attempted to manage people 
so boldly, but desperation gave 
him genius. “Ormand, if 1 get you 
off the hook and find you an age- 
of-consent girl who’s willing — ” 
“Yeah — yeah,” Ormand agreed 
eagerly. “Keep the money. Just — ” 
“Yola, if I arrange a legitimate 
adoption, court-approved, so you’ll 
never have to go back to — ” 

“Yeah — ” she echoed fervently. 
“Time,” the lieutenant called. 
Fisk stepped to the desk. “As 
I was saying,” he said so smoothly 
he surprised himself, “it was all a 
misunderstanding, v Mr. Ormand 
was looking for a wife to take to 
Venus — he’s going to be cultivating 
exotic Venus plants for export to 
Earth, you know — and the agency 
thought he meant the phrase 'little 
girl’ literally, not knowing the 
way spacers talk. When the two 
were introduced, the error was 
quickly apparent. He was naturally 
upset and so was the girl, as you 
can readily understand. In their 
confusion they exchanged some 
unkind words — ” 

“Yeah — ” Ormand muttered 
thoughtfully. 

“So Mr. Ormand may have said 
'kidnaped’ when he meant 
'defrauded.’ A natural error in the 
circumstance. Actually 1 was 



taking the child back to — ” Here 
Yola opened her mouth, but he 
elbowed her warningly. “To 
assist me in locating the correct 
subject. One of the sixteen-year- 
old girls just graduating from the 
orphanage, eager for the security 
of marriage. Young enough to be, 
uh, malleable. Who likes to 
travel — even as far as Venus, 
where there would be no female 
competition for attention.” 

“Yeah,” Ormand said, his 
face lighting. 

The lieutenant nodded. “You 
wiggle pretty smooth for a worm 
in human clothing,” he said 
approvingly. “But what about 
Miss Tantrums, here? You have to 
shut her up before she says some- 
thing I might have to jail you for.” 
Fisk could have done without 
such candor. “Once we have 
clarified Mr. Ormand’s situation 
satisfactorily, I will — ” Here he 
paused to gird himself for the 
sacrifice. “1 will take Yola to the 
court to — to adopt her myself. I 
am, 1 believe, an eligible parent.” 
Yola’s mouth fell open. “Gee — 
really?” she breathed ecstatically. 

“Yes, really,” Fisk said, hoping 
he wouldn’t regret this decision of 
expediency for the rest of his 
life. “I’m young enough to be 
your father, you know, and I’ve — 
cr — always wanted a black baby.”

ADDRESS 








FREEZEOUT 

He needed his tomorrows, 
but did they need him? 







T he pain persisted, but Lam- 
bert ignored it. It was cold 
in the plane, but it would be 
colder outside. He turned up his 
fur collar, put on his fur hat and 
walked down the aisle, carrying 
his light case clumsily with his 
double-thickness gloves. He felt 
a twinge in his side as he turned to 
the doorway and disembarked, 
down the steps, out onto the frosty 
runway. There was no wind, but 
he could feel the icy cold already 
trying to get at him. He smiled 
grimly. 

Oymyakon, Siberia. The coldest 
place in the world. The natives 
didn’t seem to mind, bustling about 
cheerfully in their heavy furs. 
Lambert walked briskly toward 
the airport buildings, but before 
he had gone a dozen steps his face 
smarted and he wished he had 
worn a scarf. He quickened his 
pace and put his free hand over 
his mouth and nose. The terminal 
loomed close in the morning mist 
— the strange “human-habitation 
fog” of Siberian cities. Below-zero 
weather ordinarily was accom- 
panied by clear air and sunshine, 
but not here or at Yakutsk, where 
he had changed planes from 
Moscow. 

Was this the end of his journey? 
He hoped so. Seven time zones 
from Moscow, eight more from 
New York. He would have gone 



around the other way if it had been 
practical. Being here was an accom- 
plishment in itself. Few Americans 
had visited this part of the world 
in wintertime. Or wanted to. 

Pushing through the door of the 
terminal, Lambert was greeted 
by a rush of warm air, then by an 
old friend who shook his hand, 
took his case and escorted him 
to the bar. 

“Welcome to the Pole of Cold.” 
David Owen, a small wiry Welsh- 
man in Russian dress, grinned. 
“Sorry 1 couldn’t arrange a record 
— it’s only fifty-eight below this 
morning. Fahrenheit.’’ 

Lambert murmured greetings 
and thanks, felt the pain in his side 
and sipped at the drink already 
set up. He gasped as it burned 
his lips. 

Owen laughed. “That’s Spirt. 
It’s ninety-six per cent alcohol, 
doesn’t freeze as easily as vodka. 
Popular around here.’’ He chuck- 
led, then turned serious. “How’s 
the — how’s the health?’’ He looked 
concerned and Lambert turned 
away, sipped again, this time more 
carefully. 

“No better,’’ he said softly. 

“How long?” asked Owen, eye- 
ing him. Lambert realized he 
looked trim and fit on the surface. 

“I don’t know,” he admitted. 
“Pain’s been about the same since 
the operation. They weren’t too 



85 




definite. Anyway, I didn’t lose 
any time getting here.” 

‘*And I’m all ready for you,” 
Owen announced with a look of 
pride. “Nothing I wouldn’t do for 
an old friend — even if he is a lousy 
capitalist.” Lambert looked up 
sharply and Owen went on: “Don’t 
worry, no one speaks English 
around here. But I surprised myself 
getting you in here. I haven’t tried 
to get a real defector into Siberia 
before. But I’m grateful for those 
donations — ” 

Lambert sighed, said it was 
nothing. At least he hoped it was 
nothing — that his financial aid 
to certain organizations to get him 
into Siberia would do no harm. 
Desperation required desperate 
remedies. He was dying of cancer. 
Besides, Owen was a real friend 
despite his affiliations. Lambert 
had once saved Owen’s life in 
Hong Kong — or had it . been the 
other way around? No matter. 
Now Owen was going to repay 
him by killing him — or making 
him immortal. 

I N THE privacy of the taxi — the 
windows were all frosted over 
except for the double-glassed 
windshield — Lambert leaned back 
and tried to relax. He felt the dull 
pain again. He toyed with a sudden 
wish to dash out into the cold and 
freeze — end the pain — but the de- 



sire was weak. He hadn’t yet tried 
suicide — he scarcely knew why. 
He was not afraid. The reason had 
to be that he simply wanted to 
survive, deep down inside. He had 
never been a loser. 

Owen was chattering on, talking 
about his wife. No, it was Lam- 
bert’s wife he was asking about. 

“She’s not my wife any more, 
Davy,” said Lambert. “Not for a 
long time. She came to see me in 
the hospital, though. ‘Put your 
faith in doctors or in God — not 
in a refrigerator,’ she said. Now 
the doctors — and perhaps God- 
have given up. There remains the 
refrigerator.” Lambert grunted. 
“She never did understand my 
recent political activities. ‘You, 
a confirmed conservative, turned 
communist.’ Deception, deception. 
I didn’t deceive you, though.” 

“I don’t mind that sort of decep- 
tion,” said Owen. “Besides, this 
gives me a chance to prove some 
of my pet theories and maybe con- 
vert you — as well as congeal you.” 
Lambert shuddered at the 
Welshman’s dark humor. “I ought 
to be open to conversion. The pro- 
cedure we’re ^oing to attempt 
isn’t -as foolproof anywhere else. 
Of considered quite acceptable.” 
Owen grinned. “It isn’t exactly 
legal here, either.” At Lambert’s 
quick look of concern, he amended 
this. “It isn’t criminal, but — well — 



86 



IF 




let’s just call it unauthorized.” 

“I hope you’re not putting your- 
self out for me.” 

“Don’t worry,” said Owen. “The 
test of a good worker is whether 
he can get around rules when he 
can’t follow them. The procedure 
is officially outlawed. But you are 
not a Soviet citizen — ” 

“Why is this particular applica- 
tion of cryogenics outlawed, 
anyway?” complained Lambert. 
“What business is it of any govern- 
ment what individuals want to do 
with their lives?” 

“We are all socialists now, 
remember — the trend is evident 
even in your country. It is against 
society that some should be given 
—by the state — a longevity denied 
others. Remember the old argu- 
ments? What was the name of 
that club we belonged to? The 
Society for the Preservation of 
Experience — 

“Bah. That’s not what I want to 
preserve — the law dispersed those 
fools like dry leaves. There was 
always more than a sprinkling of 
crackpots among them. I am some- 
what of an authority on psycho- 
ceramics, having been exposed to 
the cancer-cure racket. But this 
is not just another cancer cure. 
It’s the simple matter of preserv- 
ing life until science discovers a 
real cancer cure. And that’s just 
a matter of time.” 



“Do you believe that?” asked 
Owen. 

“Certainly. And cryogenics for 
this purpose is going to be accepted 
eventually, wait and see. Only I 
can’t wait.” 

Owen peered out through the 
windshield. The fog had now lifted 
and they had emerged into bright 
sunshine. They were outside the 
limits of Oymyakon — only a few 
.scattered old wooden buildings 
were visible here and there. Owen 
spoke a few words in Russian to 
the driver. 

Lambert sard, “Aren’t we going 
to a hotel or — ” 

“To my home? No. I thought 
you didn’t want any delay.” 

“That’s right. I don’t.” 

T he taxi pulled up before a 
low brick building, isolated 
in a field of snow. Lambert got 
out and experienced the cold again. 
He slapped his gloves to his face, 
while Owen talked to the driver. 
The taxi pulled away and they 
crunched across the squeaking 
snow. Lambert felt his nose was 
being frost-bitten. Maybe it didn’t 
matter now, but . 

The building seemed not much 
warmer. This was a branch of the 
Permafrost Institute, Lambert 
learned. After a slight delay a 
young Russian technician took 
them to an elevator. They went

down. And down. And down. 

They stopped at the bottom 
level, apparently the sub-sub- 
basement, then emerged into a 
large open space, not a basement, 
but an underground cavern. At 
one side were a partitioned office 
and laboratory from which an 
older man appeared, greeted Owen, 
nodded to Lambert. 

Owen said, “This is the man 
I was telling you about — Dr. 
Oschepkov.” He spoke in Russian 
to the doctor, who looked at 
Lambert doubtfully, then spoke 
sharply to Owen, showing an irri- 
tation that transcended the lan- 
guage barrier. Lambert thought 
he understood some of the words, 
but he waited for Owen’s 
translation. 

“He says it’s illegal to freeze 
before clinical death. I told him 
you couldn’t wait for that. He says 
he’s only experimented on foxes.” 
He turned back to Dr. Oschepkov, 
conducted a long argument, which 
Lambert didn’t try to follow. He 
felt discouraged — the pain was 
coming again and it was cold 
down here. The argument seemed 
interminable. 

Finally Owen turned to him, 
grinned. “It’s all right. I have a 
bit of influence, you see. But you’ll 
have to sign some papers.” 

They entered the small office, 
went through a legal ceremony 



about which Lambert understood 
little and cared less. Then the 
doctor and the young technician 
bundled up in additional clothing 
and they all proceeded briskly 
across the cavern. Lambert found 
it hard to keep up, but was glad 
to be walking again. The exercise 
warmed him a little. 

The cave narrowed and became 
a tunnel. Dr. Oschepkov walked 
ahead with his assistant, talking 
in Russian, while Lambert and 
Owen brought up the rear. Some- 
how Lambert couldn’t think of 
questions, despite his curiosity, 
but Owen filled him in satisfactorily. 

“This is a natural cave, although 
it has been expanded somewhat. 
We’re five hundred feet down, 
right in the heart of the perma- 
frost. Here anything frozen will 
stay frozen forever without any 
power expenditure. You needn’t 
fear a power failure.” 

Lambert said, “But permafrost 
isn’t cold enough for this.” 

“It’s not cold enough to freeze 
you safely, but it’s cold enough to 
keep you after the freezing process. 
This is the same cave where they 
found a mammoth not long ago.” 
Owen grinned. “We’re thinking 
of calling it ‘Mammoth Cave.’ ” 
Lambert shuddered. He thought 
of the perpetually frozen earth all 
around him and wished he were 
already lying in it. To sleep .

Owen continued: ‘They use the 
liquid nitrogen technique — com- 
bined with some new methods — 
to get you safely past the zone of 
crystallization. He’s been success- 
ful with animals, mostly foxes. 
Frankly, I think he’s happy to get

mon thing, he says, though now 
it’s experimental. Don’t worry 
— they know their business. Lately 
the neighborhood fox farms have 
been getting some of their foxes 
back.” 

This was encouraging, Lambert 
thought. 

They turned into a side corridor, 
which was even narrower and 
lower. It was getting colder. The 
walls were covered white in the 
dim glare of small lights hanging 
at intervals. The cold was intense 
and seemed to make the gloom 
close in. Like catacombs, Lam- 
bert thought. Well, why not? That 
was what these were. 

T hey came to the end of the 
lights, walked a few hundred 
yards farther by Oschepkov’s 
flashlight. At the dead end was 
a gloomy room stacked with 
strange metal boxes, mostly small, 
though there was one large one. 
Lambert tried to shudder but was 
too cold. He succeeded only in 
making his teeth chatter. 



In the walls were many dark 
holes, their purpose obvious. 
Dr. Oschepkov said something 
in Russian. His assistant tipped 
the large box upright onto a dolly 
and trundled it across the room to 
some machinery. The technician 
and doctor busied themselves for 
a long time, setting up complicated 
tubing and wiring and occasionally 
seeming to curse and argue. 

Lambert wanted to ask Owen, 
Do they really know what they re 
doing? but his lips refused to open. 
Owen smiled reassuringly, but said 
nothing. Lambert huddled inside 
his inadequate winter clothing, 
shivering uncontrollably. 

God, it was cold, Lambert, 
waiting, thought only of how cold 
it was. The tiny pain was almost 
forgotten in the larger discomfort. 
Finally the doctor said something 
and Owen interpreted. 

“Strip, he says.” 

Lambert could only shake his 
head and shiver wordlessly. He 
was powerless to answer, even to 
move. 

Dr. Oschepkov spoke in Russian 
and Owen translated. “He says, 
‘Do you want to be comfortable — 
or do you want to awaken?’ Cheer 
up, it won’t be long now.” 

With shaking fingers Lambert 
tried to comply, but he had to be 
helped by Owen and the doctor. 
Finally he stood naked, burning

with cold, blind to any other 
thought but icy, icy, cold, cold, 
cold. He could not mpve. He saw 
hands grasp him but he could not 
feel them. They moved him into 
the box. 

He stood there freezing, freezing, 
and they sprayed him with shocking 
snow. The door shut and blackness 
closed in. 

From somewhere came a clang- 
ing, a ringing. Ring out, wild bells, 
to the wild sky . Through the 
cold and the pain he felt the box 
fill up. Cold. Cold. A little pain — 
but this was replaced by cold. The 
cold seemed less. The pain was 
gone. So was the cold. Peace. 
Ring in the thousand years of 
peace . 

H e partially awoke to the sound 
of bells again. Church bells, 
they sounded like. Church bells 
in Siberia? No, this was not Siberia 
— couldn’t be. He felt warm. He 
lay back and slept again. He 
dreamed he was in school, reciting 
a poem, and he knew all the lines. 
Ring out wild bells, to the wild 
sky, the flying cloud, the frosty 
light; the year is dying in the night; 
ring out wild bells and let him 
die . Die? His thoughts were 
troubled, but there was peace. He 
skipped to Ring out old shapes of 
foul disease . felt a pain and 
opened his eyes. 



He was in a hospital bed, he saw. 
He lay perfectly at ease and when 
he wanted to turn, something in the 
bed helped him. Tubes and wires 
seemed to be attached to his body 
beneath the soft blanket that 
covered him. The ceiling was of 
restful mixed colors and strange 
patterns, as was the rest of the 
interesting room, filled with odd 
furniture. Even his bed was barely 
recognizable as a bed. Suddenly 
his memory came back with a rush. 

With knowledge came a nagging 
pain in his side, small but persis- 
tent. He had been revived from the 
freezer, but had not been operated 
on as yet. His trip had been sec- 
cessful. He was in the future. 

He lay back, content with that 
knowledge. Then he wanted to 
know more and looked around for 
a button to push, a bell to ring — 
something. “Nurse — doctor — ’’ 

he croaked. What was “doctor” 
in Russian? He couldn’t remember. 
He groaned as the pain hit him. 

The door opened and a dark- 
haired, not unhandsome woman 
in tasteful blue and white uniform, 
entered. “I am Dr. Ivanova.” She 
smiled. “You want something?” 

Lambert stared admiringly. 
“You’re Russian.” He sighed. 
“But you speak English. If I am 
still in Siberia, what are those 
bells I hear? They sound like church 
bells.” 



90 



IF 




Her smile vanished, but friendli- 
ness remained in her dark eyes. 
“I speak English because you called 
for ‘nurse’ and ‘doctor’ in English. 
I am Dr. Irina Ivanova, Director 
of the Petrograd Hospital and 
Medical Museum. And you are no 
longer in Siberia. This is Petrograd 
—it is Sunday and those are church 
bells you hear.” 

Lambert was puzzled. “Did you 
say, Petrograd? Not Leningrad? 
Am 1 in the past or the future — 
or what? I last remember being 
in Oymyakon, Siberia, in — ah — 
nineteen-seventy-six. I’m an Amer- 
ican, my name is Charles Lambert 
and I froze to death. I mean — ” 
He suddenly broke off as he felt 
a sharp pain in his side. “When 
are you going to operate?” 

She frowned. “Nineteen-;seventy- 
six? This is two thousand sixty- 
eight. Nearly a hundred years. 
Don’t you think we have had time 
enough to have gotten rid of your 
cult of Lenin? No, we didn’t have a 
revolution. The Soviet Union has 
always had all the forms of democ- 
racy. All we had to do was vote 
out the Party. Not any easy task, 
I admit.” She smiled again. 

“This is the future, then,” said 
Lambert. “You’ve made changes — 
good. But — that’s not what I’m 
primarily concerned about. A 
huadred years — medical science 
must have advanced greatly. Have 



you found the cure for cancer?” 
He watched her face closely. 

“Of course,” she said. “We have 
eliminated all major diseases. 
Occasionally a new disease comes 
up and takes a few months or years 
to eradicate. Here at the museum 
we study the old diseases to make 
sure they do not recur. The reason 
you are here now is that this is one 
of the few places that has the faci- 
lities to care for you.” 

I AMBERT, now torn between 
J hc^ and suspicion, again 
asked, “When will you operate? 
It’s not that I can’t stand it, but — 
“We have already operated. 
Several times. The disease keeps 
spreading.” She shook her head 
sadly. “We have made you as com- 
fortable as possible. There is noth- 
ing else we can do.” 

Lambert leaped out of bed in 
alarm. He found it easy as the bed 
helped him. He disconnected the 
attachments. He found himself 
standing up, clad in close-fitting 
pajamas of soft material. He felt 
fit, then noticed his toes were mis- 
sing, gasped, forgot what he was 
going to say. 

Dr. Ivanova said, “We can re- 
place your extremities easily. They 
were^amaged in freezing.” 
Lambert remembered his protest. 
“But you can’t cure my cancer?” 
“I am sorry. You have only a 



FREEZEOUT 



91 




few weeks to live — hardly more 
than when we started.” 

“You can’t cure me? Then re- 
freeze me!” 

“There are no facilities,” said 
Dr. Ivanova; 

No facilities? This was a cruel 
blow, one he had not expected. 
It was not a refusal, but a state- 
ment of fact that allowed no argu- 
ment. Yet he argued. 

“No facilities? Don’t you do any 
freezing? Don’t you practice 
cryogenics?” 

“Freezing is wrong,” she said 
flatly.. “Such an application 
of cryogenics is against na- 
ture, against evolution, against 
eugenics — ” 

“Against God?” Lambert asked 
bitterly, slumping down into a 
bedside chair, its deep cushions 
enveloping him. 

She frowned. “We have freedom 
of religion here — we are not bigots. 
Atheism is acceptable.” She shook 
her head. “No, it is reason that 
this form of cryogenics is against. 
Preserving the unfit, keeping hu- 
man discards, saving obsolete 
diseases for posterity. Thank God 
you are one of the last of the tres- 
passers. Not many are found these 
days.” 

“How did you find me?” asked 
Lambert, curious in spite of his 
despair. 

“The underground city of Oymy- 



akon expanded into your forgotten 
tunnel,” she explained. “Luckily 
you were not crushed. Apparently 
records were lost or concealed, 
maps were altered and personnel 
scattered, so that the existence of 
the tunnel was not known until 
the mole-dozers broke through. 
They found some inferior fur-foxes 
in the cave, but no human survivors 
other than you.” 

“Were there only a few success- 
ful freezers?” he asked. 

“There were millions,” she said, 
in a voice filled with contempt. 
“Your century was a very selfish 
one. You tried to use up all natural 
resources, polluted the Earth irre- 
versibly, saddled the future with 
your impossible debts and, not 
content with that, you wanted to 
impose on your children the care 
of your corrupt bodies.^’ She modi- 
fied her tone, apparently remem- 
bering that he was a sick man. 
“But now there are only about a 
hundred trespassers left undis- 
covered, This is not an actual 
count — we don’t really know how 
many there are or where they are — 
it is only a computer estimate. 
There once was a huge number. 
Would you like to know what 
happened to them? Or would 
you rather not?” she asked coldly. 

“I want to know,” said Lambert 
hopelessly. 

“They died, those who were not 



92 



IF 




already dead. Preserving a dead 
body is useless, of course. When 
the brain dies, who can recreate 
it?” 

“I know that,” said Lambert. 
“But why did the others die? Didn’t 
the machinery function?” 

“Yes, most of the time, even in 
early experimental efforts like 
yours. Later efforts were quite 
successful. Too much so. As I 
said, millions were being frozen, 
millions every year — before the 
war.” 

“Tell me about the war,” Lam- 
bert asked. 

“Which one?” 

“The one that killed off the 
freezers.” 

“Oh, they all did, in one way 
or another,” she answered. “You 
can imagine how. Some were 
damaged by neglect, constant 
relocation, bombs. Failure of 
power killed many — you were 
relatively safe in your perma- 
frost. Let me tell you about an 
interesting incident. For a time 
there was a serious food shortage 
— you are not listening. No, it 
was not cannibalism on our part. 
There is a certain sect in India — 
one of the famine areas — that does 
not bury or burn its dead, but 
consumes them, so to speak. We 
traded — for other products of 
the soil.” 

Lambert felt sick. 



Dr. Ivanova snapped, “Well, 
what would you have? Should the 
living die so that the dead may 
live? That is what is wrong with 
your whole trespasser philosophy 
you seek to displace your own 
children. You are not fit to sur- 
vive — in more ways than one.” 
With an effort she resumed her 
calm history. “There was a series 
of wars. The final one was a war 
of the sciences/’, 

“War of the sciences?” 

She nodded. “Science against 
science. For thousands of years 
science has been helping both sides 
in wars. For hundreds of years 
some people have been predicting 
that one day science would fight 
its own war against its enemies. 
They didn’t think of the logical 
counterpart to the long succession 
of previous wars. Tribe against 
tribe, nation against nation, reli- 
gion against religion, economic 
philosophy against economic phi- 
losophy. They failed to predict a 
war between different scientific 
viewpoints. You may have guessed 
that this war included those who 
believed in immortality via cryo- 
genics and those who put their 
faith in eugenics. It was finally 
settled by a breakthrough in eugen- 
ics that made human immortality 
not only useless but anti-progress. 
Freezing was forbidden and the 
frozen were awakened — those 



FREEZEOUT

who were left. Few survived this 
period. Feeling ran high against 
the trespassers.” 

I AMBERT, tiring, lay back in 
d the chair, which adjusted 
itself to his new position. “I 
appreciate all this. I expected to 
find radical changes; What I can’t 
understand is that you haven’t a 
cure for cancer.” - 
“Oh, but we have eliminated 
cancer.” 

“But you can’t cure me. I don’t 
get it. Am I a special case?” 

“No, yours is an ordinary form, 
common in your time. We have 
all the past medical records here 
in the museum. You may be 
assured that we have done all that 
doctors in your time and some 
years beyond could have done 
— and with much less difficulty. 
We have better instruments and 
techniques. But we can’t do any- 
thing to eliminate your cancer 
without eliminating you. We have 
eliminated cancer through eugenics. 
Don’t you understand what euge- 
nics is?” 

Lambert closed his eyes, groaned. 
“Then I froze myself for nothing.” 
“That is true,” she said with 
sympathy. “Would you like to 
hear about the breakthrough in 
eugenics?” 

“Yes,” he lied. 

“The real purpose of eugenics 



is not to create a super-race but 
to fight degeneration, lliere has 
always been resistance to eugenics, 
because of humanitarian considera- 
tions. We could not breed humans 
like animals, because this involved 
destruction of the unfit or refusing 
them reproduction rights. The 
other,' much greater barrier to hu- 
man eugenics was in the slowness 
of human generations. What 
could be accomplished in less than 
ten thousand years? But if one 
reduced the generation’s span to 
a half-day the same result could 
be obtained in a year — one ten- 
thousandth of the time.” 

Lambert was interested in spite 
of himself. “You mean you can 
speed up human growth? To a 
half-day? That is unbelievable.” 

She smiled. “Perhaps you have 
heard of lower sea animals that 
have two cycles of existence? The 
hydra stage of the jellyfish, for 
example, produces an offspring 
of an entirely different form, the 
medusa stage, which in turn breeds 
back to the original.' That is alter- 
nation of generations. We have 
done this with humans — that is the 
breakthrough in eugenics.” 

“Do you breed humans in the 
laboratory?” he asked with 
distaste. 

“Not humans. An alternate 
form we call portans, that is, 
‘carriers.’ The fertilized ovum — 



94 



IF 




in an artificial environment and 
under certain treatment — splits, 
not into connected cells that 
develop into an adult human, but 
into many individual cells having 
a separate existence of their own. 
This splitting goes on until there 
are millions of portans in the 
medium. Then the second innova- 
tion comes into play — the artificial 
selection. Thousands of tests reveal 
latent defects in each portan, make 
an accurate prediction of what 
each one of these cells would 
develop into if allowed to grow into 
an adult human.” 

She paused to see if he was fol- 
lowing, then: “The essence of 
quality control is rejection. Here 
it happens on a microscopic level, 
far from humanitarian considera- 
tions. One portan is selected; the 
other millions are destroyed. The 



selected portan is placed in another 
medium, allowed to develop fur- 
ther and is then broken up into 
portans again. And so the process 
goes on, a process more of purifi- 
cation than of evolution. 

“After many generations, the 
final ovum is transplanted and 
allowed to develop normally. Be- 
tween ' generations of normal 
humans, there might be a thousand 
microscopic generations. That is 
the usual desired interval for the 
removal of defects from any 
combination. Can you see now 
how we have eliminated cancer? 
By elinriinating the cancer-prone 
strains through selection.” 

“I see,” Lambert said glumly. 
He rose and the chair helped him 
to get up. He paced the floor 
shakily. The doctor turned to 
leave, paused by the door.

“The best we can do for you 
is to make your dying fairly com- 
fortable. You may be up and 
about and conscious for only a 
few weeks more. Until then you 
have a choice.” 

Lambert looked dully at her. 
“Choice?” 

“We still believe in freedom of 
choice even for the trespasser. 
Come with me.” 

Outside the door was not a 
corridor but an open-air terrace 
used as a means of entrance. A 
walk led along it in both direc- 
tions, and opposite the door was 
a low parapet. The air was balmy 
— it must be summer in Petrograd. 

Lambert hobbled to the parapet, 
looked out across a magic city. 
No other words could describe it. 
It was like an air view of Disney- 
land, seen through a kaleidoscope. 
Mingled together were skyscrapers 
and fantastic Byzantine turrets 
and beyond these the Neva 
sparkled in the summer air. He 
looked down — he was near the 
summit of a tall building, of a 
height beyond estimation, the 
stepped terrace next beneath him 
a hundred feet below. It was de- 
serted, as was the terrace he was 
on — he imagined the hospital was 
not much used these days. 

From far below he again heard 
the sound of church bells. 

Out there was a whole new 



world where he did not belong. 
He was out of place here. But it 
was a triumph of a sort. He was 
here, where he was not supposed 
to be — like man on the airless 
moon. He had straddled centuries 
and was one of the few surviving 
freezers or trespassers, as Dr. 
Ivanova had called them. 

A record of what he had done 
would be kept here in the museum, 
to be added to man’s total know- 
ledge — and one day Dr. Ivanova’s 
perfectly healthy humans might 
want to do what he had done. Not 
to saddle future generations with 
their problems and hangups, but 
to add to the wealth of human 
experience. He suddenly felt a 
little wealthier for being here. 

The slight feeling of satisfaction 
was spoiled the the recurrence of 
pain, sharper now. The doctor had 
said something about a choice. 
He turned to ask her about it, but 
she was gone. 

What choice? He leaned weakly 
on the parapet, squinted out at 
the sunlit city. Suddenly he looked 
down. 

He smiled — and all at once he 
felt right about being here. He 
thought, Fm the one who*s giving 
you a choice — what you re giving 
me is what I always had . 

And abruptly it didn’t matter 
what use either of them made of 
what each had been given. •

the land momentarily bulged like a 
knot on the trunk of a tree. 
There it was possible to see beyond 
the underbrush and foliage to 
where the village of Almada nestled 
like a child asleep between the cold 
blue blanket of the ocean and the 
dark wrinkled mattress of the hills. 
Gabriel peered carefully at the vil- 
lage, shading his eyes against the 
glare of the setting sun. But it was 
impossible to see more than a vague 
outline of misty streets and stores 
and houses and yards — and this 
was not enough. The sky was still 
bright, but the land was dark and he 
could not make out the brown 
adobe box of his own home. But 
even if he had been able to see the 




97 




house — what then? He could not 
see through the walls — he could 
^noi tell what she was doing now. 
Had she stopped crying? Was she 
drinking now, or sleeping, rocking, 
or smiling and laughing? He could 
not know. Turning, he con- 
tinued up the trail toward the top 
of the hill. When he liad finished 
at the installation he would return 
to his wife, to Maria, and then he 
would know. But not until then. 

The trail was difficult here. The 
path swooped down abruptly and it 
was no longer possible to see the 
village. Finally the land began to 
rise again. Then there was a sharp 
right turn, and the trees and under- 
brush were gone and the trail had 
reached its end. 

Years before this land had be- 
longed to the Finca family. Gabriel 
was not a young man — he was 
nearly fifty — and he could clearly 
remember the first revolution 
twenty years ago, when the land 
had been taken from the last of the 
Fincas and divided among the 
-various smaller landowners of 
Almada. These people had then 
moved their families here to the top 
of the hill, building small houses 
and even a general store. But now 
these houses were gone, too, vic- 
tims of the second revolution five 
years ago, and now the land be- 
longed to nobody. It belonged 
to the government and to the 



foreigners who were the friends of 
the government. They had con- 
structed the installation here at the 
top of the hill three years ;ago. 

None of this had ever affected 
Gabriel, until the day when Dr. 
Berg had come to Perez’s cantina 
and given Gabriel the job. The 
House Gabriel lived in with his wife 
Maria and her son Juan was also 
the house where his father had lived 
before him and, as a fisherman, he 
was not a member of any of the 
various political factions. Until six 
months ago he had never in his life 
stood here at the end of the trail at 
the summit of the hill. 

The installation was a huge squat 
concrete structure, as unassailable 
in appearance as a Spanish fortress. 
Gabriel was the only villager who 
had even been inside its walls. Most 
of the men who worked there were 
foreigners like Dr. Berg and Dr. 
Goddard, arid those who were not 
foreign were the men from the 
north who served as janitors and 
cooks and sometimes as special 
policemen. They were as alien to 
Gabriel as Dr. Berg, who spoke a 
language he did not understand. 
Gabriel did not know why men 
were brought from as far away as 
a thousand miles to work at jobs 
that any villager could just as easily 
have performed, but neither could 
he understand why Dr. ^ Berg had 
given him the job.

IF 




D r. berg had come to 
Perez’s cantina one after- 
noon. A tall gaunt man with very 
thick black eyebrows and a slick 
white coat loosely buttoned across 
his chest, he had asked Perez, 
“Who is the most trustworthy man 
you know?’’ 

Perez had not been given a 
chance to answer. 

Gabriel, who had not had a good 
day in his boat and who was a little 
drunk, had replied instead, “I am 
the most trustworthy man in this 
whole village.” 

“Good.” Dr. Berg had turned 
upon him and Gabriel had been 
very frightened by this strange- 
looking man. “Then report to the 
installation tomorrow morning at 
eight o’clock and ask for Dr. Berg. 
I have a job for you.” 

“Are you certain?” Gabriel had 
asked. 

“Of course. The pay is quite 
decent — don’t worry about that. 
As long as you are trustworthy.” 

“I am.” 

“Your name, please.” 

“Gabriel Solar,” he had said, 
stammering. Then ashamed of 
showing his fear before this power- 
ful-looking foreigner, he had stood 
very erect and looked directly into 
the man’s eyes. 

“I shall be expecting you,” Dr. 
Berg had said. 

That had been six months ago 



and each day since then (including 
Sundays) Gabriel had followed the 
twisting path up the face of the hill 
to the installation gate. He left his 
house every morning at precisely 
seven-thirty and he returned at six 
o’clock. Occasionally Dr. Berg 
would ask him to come back to the 
installation later in the evening and 
today was one of those days. 

It was now nearly eight o’clock 
and the last faint rays of the declin- 
ing sun pecked at the back of Gab- 
riel’s neck as he approached the 
guards’ booth, which stood beside 
the gate. 

The guard knew him. He was a 
foreigner decked out in a shiny blue 
uniform with three horizontal 
silver stripes and a white hat with a 
polished bill. He nodded at Gabriel, 
went into his booth and touched the 
button that caused the gate to rise 
briefly into the air. Gabriel stepped 
past the open gate and into the in- 
stallation. This was the only en- 
trance through the high wire fence 
that circled the installation like a 
tarnished necklace. Sharp bristling 
barbs of wire were evenly spaced 
along the uppermost strand of the 
fence. 

Three weeks ago a young girl 
picnicking nearby with her family 
had climbed a tree and placed the 
paln^ of her hand against the 
barbed wire. She had screamed and 
fallen out of the tree. The grass was 



UNDERBELLY 



99 




soft and she had landed on her 
feet, but her hand had been burned. 

Gabriel understood why this had 
occurred — there was heat elec- 
tricity, running through the wire. 
Dr. Berg had told him, but Dr. 
Berg had also warned him that 
to discuss anything at all about the 
installation in the village would be 
as great a dishonor as the sin of a 
priest who reveals the details of a 
man's confession. Gabriel had ac- 
cepted this, but he did not like the 
little girl's being hurt and he felt 
guilty. 

Once he was inside the installa- 
tion, Gabriel went immediately to 
Dr. Berg's office. It was located in 
a small building set apart from the 
main structure. The office was 
small, cluttered and furnished with 
a bare iron cot and two long 
wooden benches heaped with in- 
struments and tools. Several large 
wire cages were on a shelf that ran 
the length of one wall. These cages 
were presently empty except for one 
in which a long/ rat scampered and 
ran, occasionally flopping over on 
his back and kicking his legs high 
in the air. Gabriel had never seen a 
rat acting so before. 

Dr. Berg was alone. He sto6d 
beside one of the wooden benches 
and, hearing Gabriel enter the 
room, said, “We'll have to wait for 
Dr. Goddard." 

“Yes," Gabriel said. 



H e crossed the room to the 
cage where the rat was penned 
and poked a finger through the 
wires. The rat stopped his running 
and came to investigate, sniffing at 
Gabriel's finger, then nibbling. 

Gabriel was not afraid that the 
rat would try to bite him. They 
were good friends. The rat was 
named Poppa. 

“Hungry, Poppa? Smell the food 
on my finger? Playing so hard 
makes you very hungry." 

“Gabriel," said Dr. Berg. 

“Yes?" He removed his finger 
from the cage and turned his back 
on the rat. 

“What’s this I hear about Jen- 
kins? Is it true?" 

Gabriel was not surprised that 
Dr. Berg knew. He always seemed 
to know everything about anything. 
So why not this as well? 

“Yes," he said. 

“And your son?" 

“Maria’s son. By Joseph, who 
drowned in the storm." 

“I see." Dr. Berg crossed the 
•room, opened the door and peered 
out at the darkness beyond. Then 
he came back and looked at his 
watch. “I’m afraid they’ll catch 
Maria’s son. These hills — there’s 
no place he can hide for long." 

“No," Gabriel said. “He did a 
foolish thing." 

“Do you know why?" 

Gabriel shrugged. He placed his 



100 



IF 




hands together in front of his waist 
and looked down at the clasped 
fingers. “Because he was afraid of 
me.” He knew he could never lie 
to Dr. Berg. “He hated me.” 

“And your wife?” 

“She feels the same way.” 

“And you can’t think of anything 
to tell her?” 

“No.” 

Dr. Berg sighed deeply. “Neither 
can I.” There had been no force 
behind his questions, no interest or 
curiosity. He had seemed to be 
asking them because after he had 
begun he had seen no way to stop. 

“It’s a miracle Dr. Goddard 
hasn’t heard,” he said. “Damn 
him.” 

Gabriel went over to one of the 
wooden benches where there was a 
bare space and sat down. He sat so 
that he could watch Poppa as the 
rat played in his cage. 

He began to think about his 
trouble. 

It had not begun with the boy, 
but that had been the worst. Not 
the boy who was his wife’s son, but 
the other boy, Manuel, whose 
mother he did not know. Gabriel 
had been bringing in his boat after 
an afternoon’s fishing on a day 
when Dr. Berg had sent him home 
early. 

The whole happening came back 
to him as if it were now — as if he 
had not lived since that day. 



H e still liked to fish and 
went out whenever he could. 
He knew his work with Dr. Berg 
would not last forever and eventu- 
ally he would have to return to the 
sea. He had not done well this day 
and he was angry at himself. As he 
was pulling the boat ashore he 
heard the cries coming from farther 
down the beach and knew instantly 
what they meant. He had heard 
such cries before in his life and 
twice he had seen the bloated rot- 
ting bodfes that wei^ washed ashore 
afterward by the strong currents. 

This time he ran toward the 
sounds and then he was there — and 
was not. He did not feel the freezing 
waters covering his body until his 
head was fully submerged and he 
was swimming toward the shattered 
light of the sun. The boy had 
strayed far from shore, Gabriel 
poked his head above the water, 
looked and saw the hands clawing 
at the air as if to grasp and hold 
it. Then the hands were gone, and 
when Gabriel reached that place 
the boy, too, was gone. 

Gabriel dived. Once and again. 
The second time he stayed down a 
long time, dropping all the way to 
the bottom, feeling the coldness 
there like a numbing heat, like sun- 
burn, and then he saw the boy. 
Manuel. Whose name had been 
cried on the shore. He was lying on 
the bottom, his hands raised toward 



UNDERBELLY 



101 




the distant surface, his black hair 
streaming above his head like 
strands of ocean algae. His eyes 
were open and as Gabriel drew near 
he saw that Manuel's mouth was 
open as well. He took the boy un- 
derneath the arms and climbed 
slowly toward the surface. Then he 
was paddling toward shore, towing 
Manuel, keeping the boy’s head 
above the level of the waves. 

The boy was not breathing. The 
people on the beach — and many 
had been drawn to the spot by the 
mother’s cries — backed away. He 
stretched the boy out on the sand 
and stood over him. An old woman, 
her face nearly hidden by a tattered 
shawl, came close and screamed a 
word in his face. He lifted his head 
and looked at the people, seeing the 
face of his wife’s son among them. 
The people stared fearlessly back 
at him, but not a one of them 
moved. 

“Breathe into him,” Gabriel said. 
“Somebody must breathe into 
him.” 

“TVflcAo,” said the old woman, 
who had stepped back into the 
crowd. “TVac/io!” she screamed. 

The boy’s mother ran forward. 
“Do not touch him. You are death. 
You have killed my son.” Dropping 
to her knees, her dress already 
stained by the wet sand, she pulled 
her son tightly to her bosom. Sea- 
water spurted from between the 



boy’s open lips, splashing his 
mother’s throat. She caressed his 
hair and face. 

She said much more to Gabriel, 
muttering, murmuring, suddenly 
shouting. Gabriel did not know 
what to do. He simply stood there 
beside the water, oblivious to the 
woman, to all of them except Juan, 
Maria’s son, but Juan said nothing. 
He stared back at his mother’s 
husband and his lips moved. But if 
any sound came from between them 
it was lost beneath the crash of the 
surf and the screams of the mother. 

Gabriel knew what it was. The 
final time he had gone down after 
the boy he had stayed underwater 
for fifteen minutes. Standing on the 
beach, looking at Juan, he remem- 
bered how his breath had grown 
shorter and shorter and his chest 
become filled with pain. He had 
kept going, desperately searching 
the bottom — and then the pain had 
gone. He had felt fine and he had 
continued to search, not breathing 
after that, not needing to breathe. 
And when he had cracked the sur- 
face and seen the glowing light of 
day he had taken one breath — a 
small one. He had not needed more. 

Fifteen minutes. For a quarter of 
an hour he had lived withou" air. 

iiAM I late?” 

Dr. Goddard was an awk- 
ward man whose white coat barely 



102 



IF 




concealed the immensity of his 
belly. He had entered the room 
while Gabriel had been thinking and 
now he had gone to the cage, opened 
it, caught and removed the rat. 

He held Poppa cautiously in his 
hands. 

Dr. Berg came over to him. “I 
assume you were busy?” 
“Administration,” said Dr. God- 
dard. “Couldn’t get away.” He 
jerked his head at Gabriel. “Does 
he have to be here?” 

“I want him.” said Dr. Berg. 
“For your sake I hope he’s too 
stupid to understand what he sees.” 
“It doesn’t matter,” Dr. Berg 
said. “Gabriel can be trusted.” 

“No one can be trusted too far.” 
Dr. Goddard pressed Poppa against 
his chest. “Gabriel — get us the 
icepick.” 

Gabriel glanced up at Dr. Berg, 
who nodded slightly. Gabriel stood 
up, went to the other bench and 
found the icepick hidden beneath 
a wad of used paper towels and a 
torn chart that contained numbers 
and letters neatly arranged in a 
series of boxes. Dr. Goddard was 
having trouble with Poppa and he 
shouted at Gabriel to hurry. Cross- 
ing the room, Gabriel held the pick 
cautiously in one hand as though it 
were alive and might turn suddenly 
and try to bite him. The top of the 
pick was bright and clean. The 
handle was made of dark hardwood. 



Gabriel handed the pick to Dr. 
Goddard. 

“Good,” said Dr. Goddard, puff- 
ing as though suddenly exhausted. 
“Now take this damn thing before 
it bites me.” 

Gabriel took Poppa carefully 
from the doctor and the rat stopped 
squirming, relaxed and lay still. 
Gabriel whispered, “Ah Poppa, ah 
baby, it is fine — everything is fine.” 
He stroked the top of the rat’s head 
with the tip of his thumb, smooth- 
ing back the soft fur. Closing its 
eyes, the rat pretended to sleep. The 
head and forepaws extended be- 
yond Gabriel’s hands while the tail 
dangled loosely. 

“I suppose there’s no reason to 
wait,” said Dr. Goddard. 

“It’s been forty’five minutes since 
the injection. I expected you 
sooner.” Dr. Berg’s hands were 
deep inside his trouser pockets. He 
rocked evenly on the balls of his 
feet. His bearing was firm and 
relaxed, like that of a young priest 
confident of his faith. “Proceed. 
This part of the experiment is all 
yours.” 

“Of course,” said Goddard, who 
gripped the icepick in« his right 
hand, holding it in the palm of his 
hand while holding the base of the 
blade between thumb and fore- 
finger. 

At a signal from Dr. Berg, Gab- 
riel raised the rat so that its head 



UNDERBELLY 



103 




was even with the tip of the pick. 

Goddard thrust the pick into the 
rat’s left eye. Poppa was silent but 
his whole body suddenly twitched 
from the whiskers to the tail. God- 
dard withdrew the pick. A trickle of 
blood oozed from the open socket 
of the eye. The blood flowed slowly 
down t^le rat’s narrow face, paint- 
ing the snout and whiskers. It was 
followed by a sudden rush of thick 
gray matter. 

“Put it back,” said Dr. Goddard. 
He tossed the pick at the nearest 
bench, but missed. The pick clat- 
tered to the concrete floor. 

“Shouldn’t be long,” Dr. Berg 
said. 

“No,” said Goddard. “Ten min- 
utes. Fifteen.” Puffing like a fright- 
ened dog, he hurried to the door 
and opened it. Sticking his head 
outside, he gasped for air. Dr. Berg 
turned his eyes toward the floor. 

Waiting silently beside the rat’s 
cage, the three men resembled 
mourners at a furneral. They 
watched the rat’s body attentively, 
as if they expected it to move. After 
ten minutes it did move. A rear 
leg began to quiver. The puncture 
wound in the eye socket had closed. 
The dry caked blood around the eye 
made observation difficult, but 
Gabriel was certain that Poppa was 
watching him from behind the 
blood. 

Dr. Goddard pressed his face 



tightly against the cage. His chin 
and lips were shiny with perspira- 
tion. Dr. Berg rocked on his feet, 
saying nothing. 

“It’s working,” Goddard said. 
“The beast is alive.” 

“Wait,” said Dr. Berg. 

Another minute passed while the 
men waited. The rat began to move, 
its tail slapping the bottom of the 
cage, stirring the dust. One whisker 
briefly shook like a leaf brushed by 
the wind. Then the rat rolled to its 
feet and stood. It walked steadily 
to its water dish and, leaning over, 
drank. 

“Well,” Dr. Goddard said. His 
face was wet and his hands shook 
as he lifted them to his face. “I 
can’t believe — ” 

“You ought to have more faith 
in your work,” Dr. Berg said. 

AFTER cleaning its face of the 
blood, working relentlessly 
with moistened paws, the rat went 
to its nest, a pile of sawdust and 
tom cloth in a far corner of the 
cage, and curled up to sleep, bury- 
ing its head deep in the folds of the 
nest. The three men walked away 
to stand near the door. Both Doc- 
tors had removed their lab coats. 
Dr. Goddard placed a hand on the 
doorknob. 

“We will resume the injections 
tomorrow morning,” .he said. “At 
the usual intervals. I have been con- 



104 



IF 




sidering. Perhaps next time we will 
use poison. What do you think, 
Alfred?” 

“That would be fine,” Dr. Berg 
said evenly. 

“Good, good — poison it will be, 
then.” Goddard had regained his 
usual composure. His hands and 
face were dry but pale. He said, “I 
must say you surprise me, Alfred. 
What’s happened to you? I can’t 
help wondering. Why no more 
demands that we press* forward? 
Why no more urging that we skip 
the preliminary experiments? Have 
you finally come to accept my 
methods?” 

“Yes,” Dr. Berg Vaid. “I have.” 

“Well, that’s good. You realize 
that our work is the most important 
in the entire history of the human 
race. We don’t dare hurry matters 
and risk possible failure. Now we 
have this animal and that is fine. 
Perhaps he will live forever. Per- 
haps not. At the moment it looks 
very good.” 

“Yes,” Dr. Berg said. “It does 
look very promising.” 

Goddard was grinning, his teeth 
glistening brightly. “Let me tell 
you, Alfred. In six months, nine 
months, who knows? Surely in not 
more than a year we will find 
ourselves a man who wishes to 
assist us in our work. Perhaps a 
convict. One who has been sen- 
tenced to die. In return we will get 



his government to commute his 
sentence to life imprisonment. In 
the event that our experiments are 
successful, of course.” 

“Of course,” Dr. Berg said. 
“That would be most ironic.” 
Dr. Goddard suddenly shook 
his head, as though recalling a de- 
tail of some significance. Gradually 
and smile faded from his lips. 

He asked, “Is something wrong* 
Alfred? 1 don’t understand you. 
The way you act one might think 
we had failed.” 

“No,” Dr. Berg said. “I’m 
simply tired. You’ll have to 
forgive me, Herman.” 

“Oh, 1 do, I do.” Goddard was 
grinning again. “I fully understand. 
Good night, Alfred.” 

“Good night.” 

Then Dr. Berg and Gabriel were 
alone in the room . Except for 
Poppa. But Poppa was sleeping. 

“The fat bastard,” said Dr. 
Berg. 

He was not referring to Poppa, 
Gabriel knew. 



G abriel sat on the end of the 
bench, his white work shirt 
unfastened and bunched loosely 
at his waist. He stared down at his 
sandaled feet, nothing the clogg^ 
dirt that lay thick beneath his 
neatly trimmed toenails. 

“He doesn’t know,” Dr. Berg 



UNDERBELLY 



105 




said, '"ir he paid any attention 
to anyone besides himself Tm 
sure he would have guessed by 
now. He would have heard about 
you.” 

“And Juan?” 

“About Juan, too,” Dr. Berg 
said. He paused for a moment and 
scratched his cheeks. He shaved not 
more than once every four 'days 
and today was not one of those 
days. “Nothing else has hap- 
pened?” he asked “You haven’t 
been involved in another accident?” 

“No,” Gabriel said. Such 
involvements had happened twice 
before and he had told Dr. Berg 
both times, because at that time he 
had not yet fully understood what 
he had become. The first time 
he had been rummaging through a 
box of old clothes, his hands buried 
deeply in the moldy garmets, when 
he had felt a sharp stinging sensa- 
tion at the tip of one finger. He had 
jerked out his hands and flipped 
the box to the floor, spilling its 
contents. With a stick he had dug 
through the garmets until the 
scorpion lay revealed. He killed 
the beast with the stick. 

Maria had been with him at the 
time. Juan had been away, fishing, 
and he had not seen that the swell- 
ing never came. Maria had said 
that it was good fortune, that 
Gabriel must have been mistaken 
about the sting, but he had seen in 



her eyes that she had not believed 
her own words. 

“No more cuts or scrapes or 
bruises?” asked Dr. Berg. 

“None,” Gabriel said. 

The cut had occurred a week 
after the scorpion sting. Juan 
had been home this time and 
Gabriel and the boy had been 
seated at the Wooden table in the 
main room, listening to Maria 
preparing cornbread in the 
kitchen. Gabriel had been playing 
with a knife, flipping it into the 
air and catching it by the hilt. 
Sometimes he would let it turn 
only once, then reach out and 
catch it. At other times he would 
allow it to go around twice, then 
grab it near the tabletop. It was 
only a small pocketknife with two 
blades a few inches long, one at 
each end, but it was the knife 
Gabriel used in his boat and he 
kept it very sharp. 

“yVo.” 

Juan had seen. Listening to 
Maria, his mind far away, Gabriel 
had lost the rhythm of the knife. 
He had grabbed it by the blade 
and it had sliced easily through 
his palm. 

He had screamed, dropping the 
knife. Maria had run in, her face 
white. Gabriel had displayed his 
hand. The cut had shown long and 
white, the skin lying in folds around 
the wound. But there had been 



106 



IF 




no blood. Not a solitary drop. 

Maria had uttered a word of her 
people: "‘"‘Nacho^ Witch. 

“You feel fine?” Dr. Berg asked. 

“Yes,” Gabriel said. 

“But something is bothering you. 
1 can tell. Is it your son?” 

“Maria’s son,” Gabriel said. 

“Do you know why he killed 
Jenkins?” This time there was 
concern in Dr. Berg’s voice, but it 
was not concern for the boy or for 
Gabriel either. For whom? For 
what? 

“Because of you,” Gabriel said. 
“Because he knew I came here and 
he thought it was you who had 
turned me into a thing that does 
not need to breathe air. Or is stung 
by a scorpion without harm. Or 
can be cut by a knife and does not 
bleed. He would have killed you. 
Dr. Berg, but he did not know one 
of you from the other, so when he 
saw this other man — Jenkins — 
coming away from the cantina he 
caught him and he killed him.” 

“But he has been in trouble be- 
fore, hasn’t he?” Dr. Berg seemed 
to know everything, so Gabriel was 
not surprised. A man who could 
make another into what Gabriel 
had become — what was the dif- 
ference between this man and a 
god? 

“Yes, he has often been in trouble 
before. Ever since I can remember. 
The police — yes.” 



“And he did take Dr. Jenkins’ 
money?” 

“That was because he was afraid. 
He wanted to leave. To run away.” 
“Then what makes you think 
this has anything to do with you, 
Gabriel? How do you know the 
boy did not simply kill and rob 
because he wanted to kill and rob? 
It was his nature. There are few 
men in your village worth robbing. 
Dr. Jenkins should not have gone 
there. He had been warned.” 

“But you came — to find me — at 
Perez’s cantina.” 

“I can handle myself, Gabriel. 
And I seldom drink.” 

T here was no point to this. 

Gabriel raised his hands and 
sighed. Dr. Berg would never 
understand about Juan, because 
it was not the boy who truly 
mattdted. It was the mother. Maria 
was an Indian and she held many 
of the old superstitions — learned 
from her mother — as truths. 
Gabriel could not forget the look 
on her face when he had come 
back from the beach that day — 
when Manuel had drowned — his 
clothes soaked and clinging to his 
body like skin. Her eyes had been 
wide as saucers and her mouth 
had hung open, the teeth exposed. 
Someone had been there ahead of 
him and told her, and she was 
now desperately afraid of him. 



UNDERBELLY 



107 




Tonight, after the police had 
come looking for Juan, it had 
even been worse. Maria had cried. 
He had never known her to cry 
this way before. It had not been 
the grief in her tears that had 
frightened him — for her son was 
dead and she knew it — it had been 
her own fear. 

“I must go back to the installa- 
tion,” he had said. 

And when he had left he had 
stood outside the door and lis- 
tened and had heard her voice 
change. She had continued to cry 
for her son, but her fear had 
.vanished. 

“Roll up your sleeve, Gabriel. 
We ought to get this done so 
we can get you home.” 

“Yes, Dr. Berg.” 

Gabriel rolled his sleeve steadily 
up his arm until the bulk of his 
shoulder lay exposed. His fingers 
added further dirt to the already 
soiled fabric of the shirt. The 
skin beneath was pale white. 
Before, in the days when he had not 
yet come to work for Dr. Berg, 
when he had gone with the boats 
all summer, his skin had gotten to 
be as dark as Maria's. But now he 
had tittle time to spend in the sun 
and he was as pale and white as a 
sheet. 

Dr. Berg returned with the 
needle. Gabriel did not turn away 
or flinch when Dr. Berg inserted 



the point of the needle beneath the 
skin of his bicep. A pale pink 
fluid entered his veins. At first 
Gabriel had not liked the needle, 
but after six months it no longer 
frightened him. 

“There,” said Dr. Berg, patting 
the tiny wound with a wad of 
cotton. “That will be the end of it.” 
“That is all?” Gabriel said. 

“That is all. I think we could 
have stopped a month ago. Fm 
sure of it. With the animals, the 
rat, the effect has never left. In 
that regard Dr. Goddard has 
been most helpful.” 

“There will be no more shots?” 
“No. Unless something unex- 
pected occurs. But you must 
continue to come here every day. 
You must not act as though 
anything abnormal has occurred. 
We do not want Dr. Goddard to 
suspect, do we?” 

“No.” 

“Fine. Splendid.” Dr. Berg’s 
teeth showed like the claws of a 
hawk. “But you must remember 
to tell me everything.” 

Gabriel said that he understood. 
Getting to his feet, he nodded to 
the doctor and then went silently 
and swiftly to the door. He 
had forgotten to roll down his 
sleeve and the cloth rode high 
against the ghostly pale flesh of his 
shoulder. Dr. Berg said nothing as 
Gabriel went out.

IF 




T he dirt path twisted jaggedly 
down the hill, splitting the 
high brown grass of summer into 
separate worlds. In darkness now, 
Gabriel stepped cautiously down 
the path, for it was seldom used 
and many thick vines lay draped 
across it. There was no light here, 
except for that afforded by the 
moon and stars. 

A wind came running down from 
the hills above. Brisk and cool, 
it grazed the bare flesh of his 
neck, whipped his hair and made 
him feel clean and alive. On the 
outside. Inside he wanted only to 
hurry, to run With the wind, for he 
would not feel secure until he 
reached home. But he was afraid to 
run. He did not want to risk trip- 
ping and perhaps cutting himself 
and seeing the open wound in the 
moonlight — the wound that would 
not bleed. 

When he had come tonight he 
had intended to tell Dr. Berg that 
he wanted to quit. But he had 
guessed even before Dr. Berg had 
told him that it had been too late 
and the words had refused to 
pass his lips. Now it was over — 
Dr. Berg had said so — and he 
could no longer even tell Maria 
that he had quit. 

Had they caught Juan yet? He 
knew that they would, for Dr. 
Berg had been right — there was no 
place to hide in these hills. Juan 



would have to go into a village and 
the police would be waiting there 
for him. Would he even have a 
chance to spend the money he hacT 
stolen? Gabriel hoped that he 
would. It would seem more fair 
that way. 

And who had been right? Dr. 
Berg or himself? Why had Juan 
killed the man. Dr. Tenkins? 
Because of what the installation 
done to Gabriel — or merely be- 
cause he wanted money and the 
freedom money could bring? 
Gabriel thought he knew the 
answer, but many times in the 
past he had thought he had 
known the answer to other ques- 
tions and often he had been wrong. 

When he reached the first houses 
of the village he began to hurry, 
stepping quickly through the barren 
dusty streets. The houses at the 
edge of the village were shacks 
made of thin wood — they banged 
and clattered loudly as the wind 
whipped the boards against each 
other. This was the worst part of 
the village. Gabriers home was 
not far from here, but it was not of 
this section. He had always been 
proud of this fact. He was a 
fisherman, as had been his father 
before him. Two summers ago, 
when there had not been enough 
fish, he had been so ashamed 
that he had stayed away from 
home for days at a time. It had 



UNDERBELLY 



109 




been a similar time — a slow time, 
though not so harsh — when Dr. 
Berg had found him. 

I am the most trustworthy man 
in the village. 

Why had he said it? Because it 
was true? 

Perhaps it was true — but why 
had he said it? It was not like him 
to boast so openly of his virtues. 

A POLICEMAN stood in front 
. of GabriePs home. Light 
came through the open door, 
providing a background for the 
man, ihaking him a shadow. 

“No — Gabriel — no.” The police- 
man put his hands against Gabriel's 
chest and held him away from the 
door. He could hear people moving 
and talking inside the house. 
“Juan?” he asked. 

“No.” The policeman pushed 
him farther back. Gabriel knew 
this man. His name was Diego 
and as children they had gone 
together to the sea with Gabriel's 
father. But Diego had been too 
clumsy to make a good fisherman. 
“Maria?” Gabriel asked. 

“Is that him? Is that the man, 
Diego?” 

This was a voice from inside. 
It sounded unduly harsh in the 
stillness of the night. 

“Send him in. Don't stop him. 
Let him come ahead. He will 
have to know.” 



She was in the bedroom. There 
were three rooms in the house. 
The main room was filled with 
men, many of them uniformed 
policeman. The kitchen was 
empty. Gabriel passed through 
both in order to reach the bedroom. 
Maria lay on the bed. A Wanket 
covered her. 

Gabriel knew the man who sat 
on the edge of the bed. It was the, 
doctor. 

“Please,” Gabriel said. “Let me 
see her.” 

The doctor shrugged and drew 
back the blanket. 

Gabriel looked at Maria. Her 
hands, crossed on her chest, were 
very white. Her neck and face 
were a sea of dark red. The 
knife lay on the table beside the 
bed. There was a puddle of dark 
red on the^floor below the table. 
Her face was expressionless. 

Maria clutched a crucifix. 
Gabriel noticed the way the dull 
medallion glimmered in the dim 
light, as though it possessed an 
illumination of its own. 

Then the doctor drew the blanket 
back over her head. 

“She didn't leave a note,” he 
said. 

Gabriel shook his head and 
turned to leave. 

“Well,” said the doctor. “Can’t 
you say? Why did she do it?” 

Gabriel could not say. 



110 



IF 




H e crossed toward the 
main business section of the 
village, a single street three blocks 
long of battered stores and small 
markets. The street smelled 
powerfully and constantly of rot- 
ting fish. 

The cantina squatted on a corner. 
The hour was late but the place 
never closed until the last customer 
had gone home. 

Gabriel walked across the 
wooden sidewalk and through the 
open door. Perez’s brother-in- 
law, Chalo, was working behind the 
bar. Gabriel told him that he 
wanted a beer. 

Reaching a big hand into the 
freezer below the bar, Chalo 
removed a bottle of beer. The 
tinted brown glass of the bottle 
sparkled with tiny clinging 
particles ot ice. Chalo opened the 
bottle and poured the contents 
carefully into a glass mug, 
tipping the mug slightly so that 
the foam would not spill. 

“So you are working late 
again tonight?” 

“Yes,” Gabriel said. 

“And for this they pay you extra 
money.” 

The mug was full. Taking it, 
Gabriel lapped at the foam. 
“Sometimes.” 

“But you’re not ill.” 

“No,” Gabriel said, lifting the 
mug from the bar. Turning, eyes 



darting, he searched for a suitable 
table. 

“But you look very pale,” Chalo 
said. “Has Juan been captured?” 

Gabriel found a good place to 
sit: It was the last table on the 
floor and he squeezed between it 
and the wall, setting his beer down 
first. Then he drank. The top of 
the table was deeply scarred 
with various names and phrases, 
most in Spanish, a few in English. 
There, were also many dates 
without much meaning. Again 
Gabriel drank. 

Two people were seated at op- 
posite ends of the bar. Both were 
gazing straight ahead into the 
mirror. One was either an 
American or an Englishman. He 
was drinking whisky and he was 
too old and shabbily dressed to be 
a tourist. His white hair was 
sprinkled across his head in moist 
clumps like melting snow. The 
other was merely an old woman, 
done for the night. She looked 
very tired. Gabriel had seen her 
many times before but he could 
not remember her name. 

He could not remember any- 
thing right now. Raising the mug 
to his lips, he drained most of 
the beer, then placed what was 
left at the center of the table. He 
fixed his hands one on each side of 
the mug. 

Then he began to jiray.

He prayed first to the Son and 
then to the Father. Then he 
prayed to both. He said, Our 
Father Who Art in Heaven. 
and so on. He told the Father that 
his fear was not that of any man 
who had lived before. Even the 
Son had been allowed to die so 
that he might live again. He 
said that he knew that suicide 
was a sin of mortal consequence, 
but that the choice of accomplish- 
ing this act was no longer his to 
make. 

He asked simply for death. 
For release. For death to fulfill 
Christ's promise that he might 
live again. He was positive that 
God was hearing him now. Hadn’t 
Dr. Goddard said that installa- 
tion’s work was the most important 
in the entire history of the human 
‘race? And wasn’t he, Gabriel, 
still a man? 

He opened his mind and let 
God see what he now saw in all 
his moments of waking dreaming 
sleeping working walking crying. 
He showed the funnel to God, 
stretching endlessly ahead and 
'behind, turning, spinning, shirling, 
ever the same, black and eternally 
swirling Gabriel and this smell of 
fish and these men, the doctors. 

The same and the same and the 
same. The eternal infinite 
sameness. ’ 

His lips moved, mumbling. 



Then he stopped and closed his 
eyes, waiting. 

Nothing happened. 

His breath swept sweet, pure, 
fish-smelling air into his lungs. 
His throat was moist. The taste of 
beer lay mildly bitter oh his lips 
and tongue. His nostrils were 
clean and dry. 

Oh, Christ kill me .. 

Nothing happened. 

He grabbed the mug by the 
handle and cracked it over the 
table, broken glass spilling, 
falling. He raised the jagged edge 
of the cracked mug, glass sharp as 
a razor, placed it against his 
throat, held it there, waiting, 
feeling death near, sensing its 
material presence. 

Chaol came around the bar, 
frightened. The old woman 
turned, disinterested. /The Anglo 
did nothing. 

“I cannot die,” Gabriel said 
softly. 

Juan and Maria, Maria and 
Juan, together, inseparable in 
death. And he alone was. alone. 

He dropped the glass and step- 
ped senselessly over it, pushing the 
table away. He walked out to the 
empty swirling street, endless 
street, the same street, the 
street that would never change, 
could never kill. Gabriel went 
home and Maria was gone and 
nothing happened. #

the mainstream) and to provide an Through the Deeps (Putnam, 
outlet for experimental writing $S.9S) is a good example of this. 



113 



Nobody who took himself too 
seriously would have written the 
book in the first place and no 
writer who had lost the sense of 
fun in playing with all aspects of an 
idea could have made such an idea 
a pleasure to read, as Harrison has. , 

The basic plot is about as simple 
as possible. In a world where 
George Washington was executed 
after losing the war against the 
British, his 1972 descendant takes 
on the job of building a transat- 
lantic tunnel, hoping to improve the 
chances of the American Colonies’ 
gaining Commonwealth status. 
There’s a bit of character conflict, 
a fillip of love interest and some spy 
menace to fill out the story. But 
there’s nothing that should be 
particularly new or exciting. 

The freshness obviously must 
come from the fact that Harrison 
has used some 'sort of cross-time 
vehicle to get into this alternate 
present of his. After reading the 
novel carefully I can only guess that 
he must have spent the last few 
years living there and absorbing the 
attitudes of the world. Surely this 
book was not written by a man who 
inhabits our space-time frame. 

Somewhen between 1890 and 
1972 our real present accelerated 
its rate of change and sloughed 
off most of the established attitudes 
that our grandfathers had devel- 
oped. Our literature shows this. 



particularly our more “pulpy” 
fiction. The eternal verities of lit- 
erature have been turned upside 
down and the heroines who used to 
blush now rush into bed. But there 
has been a lag in such changes in 
the alternate present. Here women 
are stiH'‘virtuous and Love is Im- 
portant. Men are clearly men, filled 
with the joy of honest work, happy 
to be what they are. Honor exists 
and is taken for granted. 

What Harrison has obviously 
done is to give us a story written 
for that alternate present. And it is 
so well done that I can’t point to 
any specific instance as illustrative, 
because the entire book is an illus- 
tration of different attitudes in a 
different world. This story would 
be accepted without any surprise in 
that world. It might even be a piece 
of science fiction written in their 
1942 about their 1972. 

The technology is also different 
from ours. Oh, the people have 
atomic power, of course, but they 
also have the inconsistencies that 
always show up in a real technology 
— but not the same inconsistencies 
that are found in our present. 

Reading Harrison’s book I found 
myself nostalgic for 1972 — the 
alternate 1972, that is. The world 
presented is a real — and generally 
a very good — one. It’s nice to know 
that if anything goes as wrong 
where we live — as it may — there 



114 



IF 




will still be the alternate present to 
carry on. Because, of course, Harri- 
son’s is a real world — perhaps more 
real than ours — as must be obvious 
to anyone who reads the book. 

F )R an example of what can be 
done by a man who really 
knows how to ride a hobby we can 
turn to Philip Jose Farmer, whose 
Tarzan Alive (Doubleday, $5.95) is 
like no other book ever created. 
Farmer has opened a wholly new 
field of research— one where the 
absence of data forms no obstacle 
to the diligent searcher. 

I’ve always considered Farmer to 
be the ultimate hobbyist of our 
field and have usually found myself 
thoroughly delighted by the results 
of his steadfast pursuit of his nu- 
merous interests. But here is the 
first example of what he can do 
when he throws off all normal 
limitations and gives himself up all 
the way, in every way, to the com- 
pletion of his appointed zwounds. 

In brief, it is his^ discovery that 
the man whom the world knows as 
John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, 
(or more familiarly, Tarzan of the 
Apes), is very much alive. While 
the possibility was mentioned by 
Clayton’s former biographer and 
popularizer, nobody but Farmer 
seems to have accepted the hints in 
Tarzan and the Foreign Legion as 
the simple facts they must now be 



recognized to be. Farmer has fol- 
lowed these and other clues to the 
discovery of the true identity of the 
man, after which he was able to 
obtain a brief but illuminating in- 
terview with Clayton. Following 
this, of course, there could no 
longer be any doubt of the reality 
of the human being so thinly dis- 
guised in the accounts of E. R. 
Burroughs. 

For a normal researcher pursuing 
routine studies, discovering the sim- 
ple truth might have been enough. 
But as a true hobbyist Farmer was 
unable to rest upon such scant 
laurels. He pursued his researches 
into the true life of Clayton and was 
able to straighten out the tangled 
web of confusion Burroughs had 
introduced to conceal certain facts. 
He found, for instance, that the 
confusing matter of Tarzan’s 
having a grown son after only a few 
years of marriage was the result of 
confusion involving the real son and 
the boy adopted by the Claytons. 

A whole section of the book 
attempts — with obvious success — 
to untangle the fictional confusion 
from the facts. A few puzzling ques- 
tions remain, of course, as Farmer 
admits. But in general 1 find my 
own theories in some cases to be 
confirmed, so 1 can naturally attest 
to the accuracy of Farmer^ pene- 
trating analysis. 

But the value Of the book goes far 



READING ROOM 



115 




beyond providing an accurate 
biography of Clayton. The so- 
called apeman was, after all, only 
one of a seeming horde of superior 
characters whose lives deeply af- 
fected the pleasure and education of 
the generation or more of readers. 
Farmer has discovered the link that 
unites the “Clayton” family with 
such famous names as Drummond, 
Holmes and Wentworth. I am par- 
ticularly indebted for the informa- 
tion given on the life of Richard 
Wentworth, since many aspects 
of his distinguished career have 
long bafHed me and no other 
researcher has done any serious 
study of this important part of our 
history. 

Though distinguished by a liveli- 
ness of tone and occasional flashes 
of welcome humor, this volume is a 
completely scholarly work. Ad- 
denda are provided for those who 
wish to examine Farmer’s evidence 
in more detail. There is a chron- 
ology, a bibliography and a most 
welcome and complete index. For 
those who have difficulty in keeping 
the textual matter in clear perspec- 
tive, there is also a simplified 
geneological chart. 

I trust that copies of this book 
will survive for at least several 
hundred years. I like to think of the 
delight of some future scholar 
who may come upon this unique 
work and whose life may be en- 



larged by the rich treasure within. 
The effects upon posterity should 
exceed those the book may have 
upon its current readers. 

And to anyone who ever enjoyed 
the fictional exploits of Tarzan all 
I can say is: Don’t be put off by 
anything in this review — the book is 
a lovely one indeed and pure joy to 
read! 

D onald a. wollheim 

has founded his own line of 
books, known logically as DAW 
Books. He plans to issue four 
volumes a month, all science fic- 
tion. That’s a large program, but 
his long experience at Ace makes 
the venture far more reasonable 
than it first seems. The first books 
are all attractive, with far better 
than average cover art. All are cur- 
rently priced at 95 each. 

Joseph Green’s The Mind Behind 
The Eye involves giant aliens, de- 
liberately created human superman 
mutants and something of the Tro- 
jan horse bit. The superman we 
follow winds up inside the head of 
a living but nonsentient giant alien 
where he is plagued by fear of infer- 
tility and by the reaction of a fel- 
low worker — all while trying to 
make the giant react normally with- 
in the giant society. 

Some of the book is fascinating 
reading, but too many ideas run 
rampant in it. Green has used the 



116 



IF 




old kitchen-sink recipe — everything 
goes in, including the sink. The 
reader is bombarded with too many 
ideas without being given enough 
time to fit in any of them properly. 
And the end of the grand confusion 
requires a bit too much coincidence 
to be convincing. 

The Day Star, by Mark S. Ges- 
ton is either a simple piece of fan- 
tasy or science fiction — 1 don’t 
know where to put it. The end of 
the city-builder evolution has tried 
to impose an end to chaos on some 
hauntingly alien cosmos — and 

chaos has struck back, making all 
the history of that cosmos a barren 
waste, except for dull cities here 
and there. 

Men from the last of the legend- 
ary cities sail through time and 
space to recover the wondrous ma- 
terial that almost trapped chaos. A 
boy from an early age sets out with 
a ghostly “grandfather” to seek 
his way to the fabled city. The novel 
is the account of the trip and its 
quiet aftermath. 

I haven’t liked Geston’s previous 
stories. But this one has a strange 
compulsion. Treatment and inci- 
dent are beautifully adjusted to the 
story: It is sort of a dream se- 
quence, with the language and 
poetry of dreams superimposed. I 
enjoyed the tale and also the curi- 
ous afterglow it left. The book not 
only has a cover by George Barr, 



incidentally, but several excellent 
inside illustrations. I’lp old-fash- 
ioned enough to like good illustra- 
tions in a book. 

One of the worst titles I’ve come 
across yet is The Tar-Aiym Krang, 
by Alan Dean Foster (Ballantine, 
95 i). With that staring me in the 
face, I kept passing over the book 
whenever 1 searched for one to 
read. But you can’t judge a book by 
either the cover or the title, it 
seems. 

The novel begins with a beggar 
boy On a trading world. He be- 
comes involved with a bunch of big- 
time traders and researchers, who 
are looking for the last, lost and 
greatest artifact of a great pre- 
human race. The artifaa turns 
out to be still operable— or would 
be, if anyone could communicate 
with it. And perhaps you can guess 
the rest. 

No element in the story is very 
original. Yet each is well done and 
the whole adds up to a good adven- 
ture, with quite a bit of richness of 
texture, interesting handling of 
characters and their inter-relation- 
ships. Recommended. 

For those who like adventure 
with an excellent problem and a bit 
of far-out science. Jack William- 
son’s Seetee Ship and Seetee Shock 
have been issued together in a single 
volume by Lancer Books, at SI. 25.

elusive offering — survival. A young 
adult male, RACK formed a liaison 
with BEAUTIFUL WINGS THE 
POWER GIVER, fertile female who 
assisted him following his hunt for 
knowledge in the "valley of warm 
waters," where RACK unearthed 
an artifact from the planet's past that 
might hold the key to its future. Le- 
gends told of OLD ONES who oc- 
cupied the planet in its youth, built 
great cities — what had been their 
secret? 

RACK’S strong body could heal 
itself at the cellular level of injuries 
and ward off the radioactive toxicity 
of the planet. His great lungs could 
extract individual particles of air

your loves. May your unions pro- 
duce a balance. May all of you — 
where the far suns glitter dimly^ 
find your tints to be brilliant and 
your blendings all-powerful. For / 
know the goodness of life and share 
your joy as I invite you to share 
mine. 

/ see flamboyant pictures of 
hope. I see the survival factor 
waxing. I see understanding. I see 
love. / see the race rising to over- 
come the hardships of our ancient 
home, replenishing the air, stilling 
the storms to allow the toxicity to 
settle into the sink holes, leaving 
the planet to us. 

Are we at the mercy of the 
planet? No. For if we merely took 
what was offered, we would die 
gasping in the clouds of death. 

The books of the learned thinkers 



tell us (and why that rather dim, 
antique word picture there — what 
is a book?} that we are beloved of 
nature and yet she does her best, 
in every way, at every moment of 
the sun circle, to kill us. Nature is 
the sacred force and is therefore not 
to be questioned. Tampering is not 
allowed. Witness my own problems 
involving an ancient law that says 
one must not dig in the softness or 
the hardness of the soil lest the poi- 
sons of death overtake one. But I, 
Rack the Healer, have, in effect, 
dug. I have wetted my hands in the 
products of the soft earth, pushing 
my fingers into the muck of a new 
streambed with impunity. 

You, out there, are you bound by 
tradition? Are your Far Seers blind 
to new knowledge? 



COULD, with my strength, 
drive us, using the mind force of 
Beautiful Wings, to catch that 
swimming world out there, that 
bright, dark-shadowed planet, our 
satellite, and speak with my pic- 
tures to the men there. With my 
eyes / see it and think, ah, how 
clear, how bright. How clean the 
air. Is it not as old, not as wasted, 
not as soiled as our world? Not, I 
think, for otherwise it would glow 
with the poison yellows and pur- 
ples rather than with the clarity of 
the hot water that gushes from the 
rocks in the valley I found beyond 
the river. 

Yes, / am strong, full of sub-

stance. Yet as we soar I feel the 
cold seep through my scdes and 
slow my blood and my love shivers 
against me and we drop to the 
upper thickness of the clouds to 
warm ourselves with the heat of the 
sun caught there, captured under 
that thick blanket. There we live on 
my stored air, finding not even a 
particle of free air for our lungs as 
our gills expel the gases without 
allowing a breath to pass. Down 
here is reality. Here is my world, 
her world— the world that belongs 
equally' to all of us. Here is the re- 
ality that binds us within our scales 
and minds. Here our outer lids 
close and we are in darkness, for 
the tender membranes of our inner 
lids are scalded by the harshness of 
it. Here we soar on instinct alone, 
guided by the Healer s sense of 
direction, by the ability of my love 
to measure distances with accuracy 
— water below, clouds around us, 
the bright sky hidden. On the sur- 
face, skimming slowly, seeking, we 
find pockets of breathable air and I 
replenish, but the storms are hidden 
and the storms that are abating 
in my homeland behind us rage 
still on the sea and the heavy 
waters heave, drenching our feet. 
Here is cruel nature — blasphemous 
thought, but true. Outside the pro- 
tective community of my birth, I, 
Rack the Healer, outlaw, can think 
such thoughts yet I have to hide 
them, for my love is not as cynical 
as I. 

The water of the sea is warm and 



I remember the feel of it on my 
scales as I dive. I remember the feel 
of the slick, pulpy plants in my fin- 
gers as / contribute to the welfare 
of the race by gathering the food 
source. 

It is said that the people of the 
eastern lands eat of the flesh of the 
small, armored animals that crawl 
in the beds of slime source. But our 
Far Seers call them poison. Does 
this not speak of the fallibility of 
the law-givers? / have not seen the 
proof but it is recorded. In the same 
sea that washes the shores of both 
my homeland and the eastern lands, 
would the small, armored animals 
be poison for some and food for 
others? 

I know only that there is much to 
learn and I, Rack the Healer, in- 
tend to stretch my mind until / 
feel it strain within its scales. For 
I have known the joy of union. Only 
favored ones are allowed more than 
an experience. I have known the joy 
and I think — although I will check 
with the store of knowledge in the 
minds of the eastern Keepers — 
that I am unique in that aspect, of 
joining my body totally with a Po- 
wer Giver, her blood my blood, her 
organs open to my healing powers. 

True, I may be suffering from ex- 
cess pride, but can such a one think 
seriously about resigning himself to 
tradition, when such small innova- 
tions open such broad vistas of 
possibility? 

We hunger. We suck the good 
broth from my pack and it re- 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER

freshes us. My cells glow, grow, en- 
gorge themselves and / feel my 
strength flowing through my 
welded tongue into her body and, 
to please me, she allows us to drop 
from fearful heights, like stones 
dropped from the escarpment, fall- 
ing, falling, until, with a long, 
sweeping rise, we soar again and / 
feel the blood drain into my legs 
and am giddy with delight and we 
laugh and sweep in* long swoops 
through the dawning sky as the 
rising sun brightens the low clouds 
and sends its glow to greet us. 

Around us is our world. We are 
not totally free, for we are depen- 
dent on the broth. For that we are 
dependent on the Far Seers who 
have tamed the hairy, many-legged 
Webber, who have bred the deadly 
Juicers to giant size and who milk 
them and combine the sticky ma- 
terial exuded by the Webbers with 
the fiery fluid of the Juicers to form 
vats of the Material to hold the 
broth. We are not independent, for 
nature has decreed that it takes the 
three mobile forms to provide food 
and shelter — Far Seers, Healers, 
Power Givers, working together. 
The particular mental talents of 
the Far Seers blend the products of 
the Webbers and the Juicers, mold 
the Material, start the process of 
breakdown in the pulpy slime- 
source plants that results, with 
power from the Power Givers, in 
our food. And we, the Healers, 
gather the slime source. So we 
are dependent on one another. 



My love and / must become a part 
of a community in the eastern 
lands which, the senses of Beautiful 
Wings tell us, are lying ahead where 
the clouds billow high. 

But there will be free times. Then 
we will fly, our packs with us, to 
see the unseen lands, to explore the 
vast empty spaces, to walk the bar- 
ren rocks of the planet. For we have 
at least the freedom of unlimited 
flight. I find, after that long, long 
distance, that / am scarcely hurt, 
that my resources are almost 
totally intact. With my metabolism 
and her ability to climb the lines of 
force radiated from the planet we 
could truly soar all the way off this 
dying orb and seek our brothers 
on the far worlds. 

Ah, you see, I am Rack the 
Healer, dreamer. 



VIII 

W EATHERED MOUNTAIN 
the Far Seer, making a rou- 
tine check of his place, noted the 
burden of the soaring Power Giver 
— a healthy young Healer with an 
almost empty pack — and mused. 
He was old. Named for his place, 
that ancient, eroded range against 
which the sea rolled on the west, he 
had lived too many sun circles to 
be amazed by the willful waste of 
the Power Giver’s substance. The 
line of flight traced back to the sea 
and that meant only one thing, a 
joy flight, for no one wanting to get 



122 



IF 




from one place to the other would 
be traveling that roufe. 

Weathered Mountain was more 
concerned that the new beginning 
was not bringing the expected rise 
in the survival factor. He was en- 
gaged in measuring the output of 
food and was grumpily becoming 
convinced that short rations were 
in the offing, since the outsidr 
conditions did not allow the 
Healers a full day’s work in the 
sea. He, of course, would be as 
short in his rations as anyone — 
it was the nature of things — and at 
his age even minor discomforts 
displeased him. 

He paid no more attention to the 
soaring Power Giver and her 
burden until his senses, swinging 
out automatically, sensed that they 
were lowering into his place. He 
checked identity idly — then rose 
quickly, moving with a spring in 
his legs which he had thought was 
long since gone, for what he saw 
pushed survival factors and food 
production into the back of his 
old mind and filled him with a 
youthful excitement. 

“Welcome, welcome, welcome,” 
he sent. “Welcome to my place and 
welcome to my air and my broth 
and my meat.” 

Rack sent thanks and said pri- 
vately, “This place is as good as 
any.” Beautiful Wings agreed, 
although she was a bit awed by the 
high-piled rocky bones of the an- 
cient mountain range. 

People, they found, were the 



same their world over. Weathered 
Mountain the Far Seer was no 
different from his counterparts in 
their homeland. And his establish- 
ment, with one noticeable dif- 
ference, was much like those at 
home. However, gleaming nuggets 
of hard material in a. display case 
caught Rack’s eye and interest. 

“We do, indeed, come from 
across the sea,” he absently an- 
swered Weathered Mountain’s 
query regarding the length of his 
journey. 

“Then your Power Giver must 
have rest. There is a vacant cham- 
ber, my prime Keeper having un- 
fortunately died during the winter.” 

“She is young and strong,” Rack 
said, “and relatively unharmed. 
She prefers to stay with me.” 

“As you wish,” Weathered 
Mountain said, seating himself. 
The excitement had begun to make 
his old limbs tremble. “Have you 
then developed new techniques for 
soaring?” 

Rack pondered the question. In 
this strange land, where people 
were said to eat the flesh of sea 
animals, he was at a disadvantage. 
He was not yet ready to reveal the 
amazing thing that had happened 
between him and Beautiful Wings. 

“Only a long period of rest and 
heavy feeding and breathing in ad- 
vance,” he said. “And, as I said, 
she is unusually strong for a Power 
Giver.” 

Weathered Mountain was not 
content with the answer, but there 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



123 




were larger questions. In his life- 
time no one had crossed the^sea. 
The last crossing, made in the life- 
time of his grandfather, had been 
for a comparison of survival factors 
and a trade in air readings which 
had indicated that conditions were 
much the same on both sides of the 
wide waters and that the same 
deadly air ipoved over all lands. 

‘The purpose of your trip, then,” 
he sent politely, “if you are pre- 
pared to discuss it with such a 
one?” 

“We are honored, indeed, to be 
greeted by one of such accumulated 
wisdom,” Rack said, “for I detect 
the presence of a double picture of 
the mind of a Keeper.” 

“It is true that 1 pride myself on 
my interest in learning,” said 
Weathered Mountain, “but you 
flatter me.” He smiled. “The new 
Keeper is young and has been newly 
filled with the store of minute 
knowledge formerly kept in the 
mind of the old one who, sadly, 
died. However, during the process 
of transferral, 1 noted that we have 
the complete records of the last 
visit from across the sea, if you 
are interested.” 

“In time, perhaps,” Rack said, 
raising the Far S6er’s curiosity to a 
feverish level. “But it is not obser- 
vation of nature — at least not in the 
form of survival factors and air 
readings — that has brought us. I 
confront you with a new piece of 
information — at least new to our 
land. It is our wish to compare— to 



discover if any knowledge of a 
comparable nature is available in 
the lands of the east.” 



B eautiful wings cast a 

look at him, for he had not 
discussed his plans with her. She, 
with the non-inventive mind of a 
Power Giver, had envisioned Rack 
applying for a position in the area 
of the Far Seer for both of them. 

“Ah,” sent Weathered Mountain 
in expectancy. 

“Perhaps it would be best,” 
Rack said, “for you to step into— a 
given and exact location in my 
mind.” 

“If you permit.” 

“Enter.” 

He blocked in the area he wanted 
the old man to examine, felt the 
mind tendrils of the Far Seer. He 
waited. The exact impressions, the 
memory, the feel, the weight, the 
texture, the taint of wet, soft earth, 
weje there as the Far Seer exam- 
ined Rack’s stored memory of the 
odd material from the valley of the 
hot waters. Rack waited, slightly 
nervous. A bit of his fear must have 
leaked, for the Old Far Seer sent 
amusement. 

“Your law-givers still abide by 
that hoary old taboo?” 

Rack felt relief. “1 am pleased to 
find that the wise Far Seers of the 
east value knowledge above tradi- 
tion.” 

“Do you see these?” Weathered 
Mountain asked, indicating his 



124 



IF 




precious collection oF hard-material 
nuggets. 

“I think there is a connection 
between the hard materials and the 
Old Ones,” Rack said. “Do you 
find that foolish?” 

A mental shrug. “One does not 
fully understand. I wish you had 
brought the new thing.” 

“Its value, of course, prevented 
that.” 

“Yes.” A blankness came as the 
Far Seer withdrew for contempla- ' 
tion. 

When he sent again he asked 
questions. Rack, freed of the fear 
of punishment, answered, telling of 
the methods used to unearth the 
object. 

“It is said by some that the Old 
Ones built with stone,” Weathered 
Mountain remarked. 

A wave of excitement sent 
Rack’s mind speculating. “There is 
evidence?” 

“Suspicion. Guessing. Curious 
formations have been found.” 

“And in your lands you have dis- 
covered no object made of the 
curious material?” 

“None, We do, of course, value 
the hard materials for their beauty, 
if not for their usefulness. There is a 
certain competition for their 
possession.” 

“And do they come from the sub- 
surface?” Rack asked. 

“No Healer can withstand the 
low areas,” Weathered Mountain 
said. 

“But there are areas — such as 



the valley of the hot waters -where 
digging is possible?” 

“It is said.” Amusement. “When 
I am offered a hard-material nug- 
get in exchange for a certain favor, 
such as a change of duty time or an 
extra ration of the Material, I do 
not question the Healer too 
closely.” 

“And your knowledge of the Old 
Ones?” 

“It is not one of my interest 
areas, but there are some who are 
as fascinated with the Old Ones as 
you. I can put you in contact with 
them. Is this, then, this pursuit of 
the old myths, your sole reason for 
journeying across the sea?” 

“Is not knowledge worthy of the 
pursuit?” Rack asked. 

Weathered Mountain, vaguely 
disappointed, but still stimulated 
by the contact, said, “My area is 
the area of interest of all Far Seers 
— life and the maintenance there- 
of. Would the sur^ knowledge that 
your odd object is the work of the 
Old Ones help those who have left 
their establishments in the low 
lands of the interior for lack of 
air?” 

“My question, if answered, 
might have bearing,” Rack said. 
“1 am interested in knowing if life 
has always been at the mercy of 
nature or— and this is not meant to 
be blasphemy — ” 

“Blasphemy is an outdated con- 
cept,” Weathered Mountain sent, 
“at least to one as old as I.” 

“Could the Old Ones have known 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



125 




more than we credit them with? 
Did they in any way control the 
forces of nature?” 

W EATHERED MOUNTAIN 
was silent. After a long pause 
he spoke. “I find that I am, after 
all, not past the ability to be 
shocked. Your question presents, 
indeed, a startling concept. Nature, 
my young Healer, is nature. How 
would you control her? By stilling 
the movements of the air? As long 
as the planet spins, there will be 
movements of the air. Moreover, 
the calculations of Wide River the 
Far Seer, in a moment of pure 
idleness, prove that if the air were 
stilled, allowed to settle, only the 
peaks of the highest mountains 
would extend above the heavy 
gases.” 

“I think in smaller pictures,” 
Rack said. “If the Old Ones used 
the hard materials, for what did 
they Use them? Would the discovery 
of such information be of more 
than passing interest to us? Is 
the object I found in the valley of 
the hot waters something left by the 
Old Ones? Or has it, as my Far 
Seers think, fallen from the vast- 
ness of the space outside? And, 
if so, if it is a flying, falling, alien 
object, is it still not amazing? For 
if it came from one of the worlds 
out there — was it not crafted by 
men like us? 1 see no conflict in 
either theory, for both contain 
much that should interest our 
minds. Life exists, according to 



our best thinking, on all worlds. 
Why would nature provide a world 
if not to support life?” 

“Had 1 not seen the death of a 
Keeper just days ago 1 could be 
more in sympathy, with your 
theory,” Weather^ Mountain 
said. “And since you seem to be 
of a strong, inquiring mind, I will 
add something that has not been 
revealed to any mind other than a 
Far Seer’s. It is the prediction of 
our combined minds, after a vast 
picture of measurements and agon- 
izing analysis, that life on this 
planet will cease to exist, save for 
the inert plants of the poison sink 
holes, in a frighteningly short 
period of sun circles, a period well 
within the range of the mind of a 
Healer. Does this shock you?” 
Rack felt weak. He seized Beau- 
tiful Wings’ hand and felt - her 
tremble. Such a thought, the ex- 
tinction of all life, was unbearable. 

“As do your Far Seers,” Weath- 
ered Mountain said, “we measure 
the growth of the Breathers in the 
southern seas. We read the air 
and the poisons therein. What we 
read discourages us. We read a 
steady decline in the quantity of 
good air. We read lower and lower 
survival factors. We measure the 
emanations of the sun and the 
movements of the air. We find 
little to indicate hope.” 

“Should this be true,” Rack 
said, “then there is ever more 
reason for inquiry.” He was 
tempted to tell the Far Seer that 



126 



IF 




something new had come to him, 
the ability to blend with Beautiful 
Wings’ flesh and to heal. ‘‘For who 
knows where inquiry might lead?” 

W EATHERED MOUNTAIN 
was tired. He longed for the 
comfort of his rack with the new 
Keeper beside him, soft and warm. 
At first he had hoped that the un- 
usual journey across the sea had 
brought new information, perhaps 
a good survival factor reading to 
indicate that somehow, against all 
logic, the planet was starting a 
new cycle of replenishing itself. 
Instead he had been subjected to 
the wild speculations of the mind 
of a Healer, had been given only 
one piece of new information of 
doubtful use. it was true that the 
knowledge of a strange, unex- 
plained object was not in any way 
going to put clean air over the 
abandoned low lands of the in- 
terior. The existence of the object 
would not save one life. 

“I rest,” he sent. “You are 
welcome to use my air and drink 
of my broth. You are free to use. 
the stored knowledge in the mind 
of my Keeper.” At the doorway 
he paused. “In spite of the superb 
condition of your Power Giver the 
journey back to your homeland 
will, of course, be impossible. You 
must therefore choose your com- 
munity. You will be welcome in 
mine. We can always use a strong 
Healer and a young Power Giver. 

I note your attachment and will 



assign your periods of free time 
so that you may be together. Take 
your pick of the unused establish- 
ments in my place and be part of 
us if you choose.” 

Rack, too, knew disappointment. 
He was not sure what he was seek- 
ing, but the Far Seer of the moun- 
tains had added little to his store 
of knowledge beyond a doubtful 
picture of the Old Ones building 
with stone. That would bear inves- 
tigation during his First free period. 
He had also been given other food 
for thought — the pessimistic pre- 
diction of death for all. It was 
small consolation that the predic- 
tion would allow him his full life- 
span, him and his Power Giver 
and their offspring. But what lay 
ahead for his grandchild, should 
Beautiful Wings give birth to a 
Healer or a Power Giver? Desflh? 
The end of life on the entire planet? 
That he would not accept. 

Soaring low, he and Beautiful 
Wings examined unused estab- 
lishments, selected a spot on the 
side of a craggy, bone-bare 
mountain where updrafts brought 
occasional breaths of good air. 
There they rested, blended minds, 
installed the new colony of Breath- 
ers from the scant reserves of 
Weathered Mountain’s place. 

To warrant the kindness they 
worked, Beautiful Wings power- 
ing a vat of brewing broth. Rack

to Weathered Mountain’s dire 
prophecy of doom. Life was good. 
While working. Rack came to 
know his fellow workers. He com- 
pared knowledge and was told — 
to his mounting excitement — 
of the methods used by eastern 
Healers to collect the hard 
material. In safe spots, scattered 
and always rare, they actually 
used tools fashioned of the "Ma- 
terial to turn the soil and find the 
telltale streaks of waste that 
indicated the possible presence of 
a nugget. He was astounded to find 
that the hard materials, once the 
surface of the soil was scratched, 
seemed to be relatively plentiful 
and, although his pride in the 
ownership of three nuggets — two 
back in his establishment and out 
of reach, one mounted on Beauti- 
ful Wings’ breast — was damaged, 
his hope was not. While visiting 
the establishment of a fellow 
Healer he saw a nugget of amazing 
size and shape. One flat, gleaming 
side reflected his image. It was a 
treasure — a crafted object, ob- 
viously, rather than an actual 
nugget. Astounding! More con- 
vinced that ever that the Old Ones 
had been more than a shiftless race 
of savages living on the fat^ of a 
young planet, he approached his 
first free period with anticipation.

B eautiful wings’ beiiy 

began to stretch with the life 



inside it. New scales sprang up to 
cover the expanded area of flesh. 
They would molt and fall after 
the birth returned her to normal 
size. After working through the new 
beginning and into the summer, 
she and Rack found stable warm 
air for their free period and, using 
their technique for soaring on 
Rack’s strength, they explored. 
They found much vast, uninhabited 
emptiness. As in their homeland, 
most of the terrain was bare. Low 
spots stank with rank growth. 
Broad, thick-watered rivers criss- 
crossed the land. Beside them, 
digging without fear. Rack found 
discoloration and indication of 
the past existence of much hard 
material. When their supplies were 
used up they soared back to the 
establishment, enriched with three 
tiny nuggets of the strange stuff. 
There they refreshed, breathed, 
ate. Rack’s hand could feel the 
life in the body of Beautiful Wings. 
The swelling of her belly never 
ceased to fill him with a proud joy. 

In the time of the end of summer 
storms he sought the mind of 
Weathered Mountain’s Keeper, 
Beautiful Wings was confined to 
the establishment, her time nearing. 
Of most interest to Rack was the 
store of knowledge transferred 
from the older Keeper, often cha- 
oticaly misfiled. Ancestral records 
were mixed with fragments of 
ancient picture poetry, plapet 
movements with speculation on the 
ancient thoughts of the Far Seers, 



128

broth inventories with the familiar 
Book of Rose the Healer. 

Rack sorted through the mis- 
filed records, musing over the 
beautiful pictures of the scant 
works of poetic Healers, passing 
the dry, technical records of the 
Far ^ ^ers, seeking something, 
something. 

It was not true, he found, that 
the people of the east were unre- 
sponsive to duty. Once, long ago. 
Red Earth had indicated — or had 
it been one of Rack’s teachers?— 
that the eastern civilization was 
based on the bartering of hard 
material nuggets in exchange for 
services. The facts were different. 
The easterners valued the hard 
material for itself as a subject of 
wonder and as a source of beauty. 
But it was also true that to 
exchange favors for a nugget was 
not unknown. 

The mind of the Keeper held an 
exact record of each exchange 
made by Weathered Mountain. 
In addition Rack found an analysis 
of different types of hard material 
and this interested him. 

Apart from this information he 
learned nothing new as the birth 
time neared and he abandoned his. 
visits to the Keeper to tend Beau- 
tiful Wings. ^ 

AS THE awareness came to 
xV. her he watched in awe. 
Thus did nature work. Soon he 
would know his child. Healer? 
Far Seer? Keeper? Power Giver? 



He hoped for the last -a daughter 
with the beauty of his love, to be 
named Many Pleasures in honor 
of the union in the far north of his 
homeland. Beautiful Wings asked 
nature — in a soft, pleased picture 
—for a true Healer. She writhed 
now, feeling the early pain. Rack, 
his hands on her belly, saw the 
miracle of birth flowering, the 
red, beautiful tint reminding him 
of the joining. Scales flowered, 
molted. 

“Come, Many Pleasures,” Rack 
sent to the unresponsive, tiny 
mind. “It is a pleasant world and 
it will be yours.’’ 

Beautiful Wings knew instinc- 
tively what do do. Her body did 
that for which it was designed, 
creating new life. Her lower por- 
tions mottled ruby red, molted, 
spread to reveal a soft fleshy area. 
The birth began with a new day’s 
dawning. A tiny head emerged, 
encased in a fleshy sack, and a 
soft, scaleless body followed. It 
wiggled with life and reeked with 
the products of birth until Rack, 
trying to hide his disappointment, 
cleaned his Keeper daughter and 
gave her to her mother to suckle 
at the flowering breast bulges. 

Nature’s balance was main- 
tained. Ungovernable forces de- 
creed the type of the child, and 
nature obviously needed another 
Keeper. 

And their life would not be 
filled with a growing Power Giver 
or a curious wild young Healer.

“Wc will have each other,” 
Beautiful Wings sent. 

Rack berated himself for letting 
his sadness show. He found some 
joy in watching the infant suckle 
the rich juices of her mother’s 
body, but he could not help but 
think of the fate of the new one, to 
be kept by a Far Seer, used for his 
pleasure. 

Ah, but she, too, would know 
pleasure. Her small mind would 
not go forward, would stay much 
as it was, knowing sensation, know- 
ing hunger and discomfort and 
comfort and good air. Protected 
inside an inpregnable establish- 
ment, she would live a long, happy 
life. And in living she would contri- 
bute — ^^for what was civilization 
but an accumulation of knowledge 
and experience? Without Keepers, 
civilization would be dependent on 
frailer memories and knowledge 
would perish. 

“We will have each other,” Rack 
agreed and sent pictures of soaring, 
traveling. The ice of the far south, 
the fire of the south lands, the 
Helds of the Breathers in the 
southern sea. They would see^ all. 

“And — ” She sent a devastat- 
ingly strong picture, full of sadness 
and nostalgia. The establishment 
where they had known their initial 
bliss, then the far north and the 
repetition. 

“Do you miss it so?” he asked. 

“I shouldn’t. It isn’t logical.” 
She smiled as the infant had its 
HU and slept. 



“1 will take you home,” he said. 
She sent alarm. 

“Surely they will listen to 
reason,” he said. “Here we dig and 
the promised death does not come. 
Too, Red Earth should be apprised 
of the predictions of the eastern 
Far Seers, the dire warnings of 
all-encompassing death.” 

“f fear for you,” she said. 

“We have,” he told her, “un- 
limited soaring ability. We could 
flee to the satellite itself, given 
enough broth and air to carry us 
through cold space.” 

“Silly.” She giggled. 

“We can in any case fly away 
again if they are not responsive.” 
He longed for his homeland. He 
would take her to the valley of the 
hot waters. There they would dig 
and unearth what they could— 
perhaps, something that would 
pull together his confused thoughts. 

When the infant Keeper was able 
to take broth she was delivered to 
the establishment of a youthful 
Far Seer, who had not as yet been 
provided with a Keeper. She would, 
they were assured, be given the 
best of treatment. The Far Seer’s 
tender handling of the baby in 
their presence comforted them. 
Rack tried not to think of her fu- 
ture, of her body being used by 
the Far Seer. He thought instead 
of the Book of Rack the Healer, 
the work he had planted in the 
scarcely formed storage space of 
her brain. Some day a curious 
Healer would find it there, read the

pictures and know him. There he 
had left all his thoughts, all his 
questions, all his discoveries. 

He knew no regret when he and 
Beautiful Wings soared into the 
clean, thin air above the early 
winter clouds. Nature provided 
and nature made a balance. Behind 
them was a baby, product of their 
miraculous union — a baby without 
a name who had ceased to be 
theirs when she took her first meal 
of broth. Ahead was home. 

X 

P PEOPLE were dying in Rack’s 
world. It was the first thing he 
sensed after an uneventful soar 
across the sea. In a land where the 
barren rocks were broken by the 
gleaming, transparent domes of 
establishments were new^ blank 
spaces. 

The Area of Responsibility of 
Red Earth the Far &er, home to 
Rack and Beautiful Wings, was 
familiar to them in physical con- 
tour and in the intangible knowl- 
edge of its scattered life. As they 
soared past the coastal sands they 
found a blank. Growing Tree the 
Far Seer, Cp-Responsor of Red 
Earth, was gone. It was as if, on a 
large board studded with lights, 
a light had gone off. And, as they 
continued toward the interior 
other empty establishments lent a 
pall of gloom to their homecoming. 

The end-of-sun-circle storms 
had started moving earlier than 



ever before and were more severe, 
more extensive. It was fortunate. 
Rack felt, that soaring on his 
power was less debilitating than 
moving on the surface. The 
relatively small amount of his 
reserves consumed by the flight 
left him plenty for the lowering 
and the hovering over Red Earth’s 
establishment. He sent down his 
mind, encountered the heat of 
pleasure below. Red Earth was 
with his Keeper. Mouth to mouth 
with Beautiful Wings, Rack 
waited. 

When it was time he sent, ‘‘I 
am Rack the Healer.” 

He was pleased to received a 
quick flush of pleasure from Red 
Earth, but the pleasure was soon 
damped by surprise, questioning, 
a heavy sense of duty. 

Rack answered, “No, I am not 
dead. Nor is Beautiful Wing.” 

“You have come back, then, to 
submit to the judgment of the 
law-givers?” 

Rack sent the strongest anger 
and contempt he could muster. 
“Growing Tree the Far Seer is 
dead \before his time. Gone are 
Strong Swimmer the Healer, 
Quick Soar the Power Giver and 
others in the eastern marches of 
the area. The storms are early and 
the Breathers labor in the establish- 
ments. At such a time will you be 
bound by your petty traditions?” 

“It is all heavy on my mind,” 
Red Earth admitted. “Your reason 
for returning, then.”

message of gl 9 om from the 
Far Seers of the east/" Rack 
said. “Would you hear in peace?” 
“In peace,” Red Earth said. 
“Welcome.” 



HAD not changed, but an 
aura of sadness hung over 
Red Earth's establishment. The 
air was pure and good and Rack 
used it sparingly. Beautiful Wings 
was allowed more freedom of 
breath, since Red Earth was ob- 
serving the rules of privacy and 
had not scanned their minds to 
discover the secret of her apparent 
good condition after a long soar. 

“I have many questions,” Red 
Earth said. “But first — the 
message.” 

It Was delivered. Red Earth 
received it with no show of emo- 
tion. After a long time he sighed, 
expelling his air. “We have read the 
same. But I would like to confirm 
the conditions in the breeding 
grounds of the Breathers.” He 
sighed again. “1 hesitate, however, 
to consume the" substance of a 
Power Giver and I must admit 1 
cringe at the thought of going into 
the outside under storm conditions.” 

“There is a way,” Rack said. He 
was not sure that what he had in 
mind would work, but the situa- 
tion was serious enough to warrant 
any experiment. The mind of a 
Far Seer would be required to 
measure the huge but decreasing 
picture of Breathers in their 



broad field of surface slime in the 
southern sea. “I ask your in- 
dulgence to break one of the rules 
of privacy.” 

“In what cause?” Red Earth 
asked. 

“Life,” he said simply. 

“A potent argument. You may 
act.” 

Rack walked to stand behind the 
Far Seer, bent quickly and pressed 
his small tongue on the bare flesh 
of the Far Seer's domed head. He 
did his magic and his flesh melted 
into the flesh of the Far Seer. Red 
Earth's mind registered high sur- 
prise, but also a quickness of 
mental grasp that awed Rack. 

“Now I bnderstand,” Red Earth 
said excitedly. But something was 
not right with the Far Seer— it 
made Rack feel uncomfortable and, 
even as he continued the merge, 
began to make repairs on the body 
of Red Earth. Red Earth was 
thinking something below the 
readable level. It was growing 
stronger, stronger and then it burst 
out as it became obvious to Red 
Earth that the Healer’s powers 
were being extended into the Far 

^HaSr^New One,” Red Earth 
said. “Hail, New One.” 

“No,” Rack said, feeling a flush 
of embarrassment. “I am Rack the 
Healer.” 

The process continued, cell by 
cell, fiber by fiber, organ by 
organ. And a sense of excitement 
spread from the agitated Far Seer 




132 



IF 




into Rack’s mind, into the mind 
of Beautiful Wings. He, Red 
Earth, in his dreams, had expected 
the New One to be a completely 
new life form, as different from the 
people as the first Healer had been 
from the Old Ones. Nature, always 
guileful, had sent the New One in a 
common form— but Red Earth was 
capable of understanding wh<tt 
had happened. 

Questions, answers, a growing 
excitement. Beautiful Wings was 
thinking only that Rack’s new 
status was fortunate — now there 
could be no further question of 
his being punished for past crimes. 
When Rack finished he left the Far 
Seer in better health than Red 
Earth had enjoyed since his 
youth. She could no longer feel 
seriously threatened by the pre- 
dictions of the Far Seers. Her world 
was good. She had Rack and a rare, 
lasting love. Their position was 
secure. They were home. 

Red Earth looked to the future 
and was brought up short when he 
learned from Rack that Beautiful 
Wings had given birth to a child. 

“A Keeper,” Rack told him. 
“She was left in the care of a 
young Far Seer of the east.” 

“No, no, that cannot be,” Red: 
Earth said, forgetting himself and 
searching the mind of Beautiful 
Wings for confirmation. Then he 
insisted that nature would not 
deliver a New One and then let 
him be wasted in death without 
having passed on his abilities. “Per- 



haps,” he mused, “the Keeper is 
also different.” 

“She seemed as all Keepers,” 
Rack said. 

“You will breed again,^ then,” 
Red Earth said. 

“Perhaps,” Rack agreed. “The 
experience was a repeated one.” 

“Yes, you will breed again,” 
Red Earth continued, excited once 
more. “When you tint we will select 
the most suitable mate.”'We felt the 
flare of jealousy from Beautiful 
Wings, sent soothing things, said, 
“Perhaps it will be you, since 
your attachment is strong.’ 

I T WAS truly a time for great 
hopes. To demonstrate his 
ability. Rack, after eating hungrily, 
breathing deeply to rebuild, merg^ 
with Red Earth’s Keeper, planting 
his healing technique into her 
storage banks as he felt her blood, 
her body, her organs. Then it was 
time for serious talk. Rack and 
Beautiful Wings, with Red Earth 
feeding the data to his Keeper, 
told of their flight to the east, 
sent the pictures in detail of all 
their activities there. Thus was 
history served, for it was the duty 
of all to record knowledge. In 
return Rack was briefed on con- 
ditions at home and they were 
discouraging. The discussion re- 
turned to Rack’s statement that 
something could be done to allow 
Red Earth to measure the Breath- 
ers in their home waters. At first 
Red Earth was skeptical, but after 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



133 




a demonstration — during which 
Beautiful Wings merged with 
Rack, encompassed both Rack and 
Red Earth in her field of power 
and lifted them from the floor to 
hold them effortlessly— he was 
convinced. 

A strange grouping emerged a 
short time later fro,m the roiling 
clouds into the thin, upper air. 
Face to face, merged, were Rack 
and Beautiful Wings. Back to 
back with Rack, Red Earth the 
Far Seer was making a rare soar, 
taking it all in, his mind seeing 
all, feeling the far suns, contacting 
the face of the satellite, measuring 
the scant spray of air particles in 
the vast heights. He let his pleasure 
flow and it was joined to the 
ever fresh pleasure of Beautiful 
Wings and Rack, who had soared 
higher and longer than any 
Healer and Power Giver in history. 
Rack laughed, seeing the bright 
satellite in the sky, playfully 
repeating his boast that with his 
vitality and the power of Beautiful 
Wings, he could send them all 
soaring there. But he was sobered 
when Red Earth, using the dis- 
tance around the planet as a base, 
sent a picture and a calculation 
of the energies involved. 

Then pleasure was put aside, for 
the southern sea was below. They 
descended through the dense 
clouds to find only minimum con- 
ditions at the surface. Red Earth 
directed the flight of the Power 
Giver, crossing the area again and 



again, his mind storing pictures so 
vast that they would not stick in 
Rack’s mind. 

It was necessary, since the air 
was scarce and the hard projectiles 
plentiful, to break his merge with 
Beautiful Wings, turn and heal 
Red Earth. When he had finished 
and she accepted him back he 
was shocked to see how quickly the 
heavy burden had sapped her. He 
felt himself flow out, giving gladly 
and feeling a tenderness that 
made Red Earth squirm with 
discomfort. 

“You arc never to soar without 
me,” Rack told her sternly. 



AFTER a time of mutual heal- 
ing, once the party was safely 
back in the Far Seer’s establish- 
ment, Red Earth went into rapport 
with his Keeper. For a long period 
he compared his new pictures with 
others, drawing occasionally on the 
minds of his fellow Far S^rs and 
the storage banks of their Keepers. 
Rack and Beautiful Wings left him 
to his labors. 

Home for Rack and Beautiful 
Wings was a dome of trans- 
parency, for Rack liked to see the 
outside. Home was also snugness 
and good air and happiness. Home 
was Beautiful Wings sleeping 
peacefully as he watched and 
waited for Red Earth’s results. The 
survival factor was negative in the 
establishment’s imm^iate area 
and the severity of the toxicity 



134 



IF 




outside cast a pall over Rack's 
emotions. 

The readings of Red Earth con- 
firmed, once he sent them, the 
predictions of the Far Seers of the 
east. He announced his finding 
by making individual contacts 
with far-flung Far Seers, calling 
for a council in the largest estab- 
lishment available, the Eastern 
Establishment. He promised hope, 
but did not reveal that its source 
was a wild dream. 

The plan had several phases. 

Selected Power Givers trans- 
ported Healers and Far Seers 
to the council. There was a drain on 
all and many perished. The 
storms were peaking and Rack, 
sensing the damage, wanted to 
spread himself to all of them and 
heal them, but he knew by some 
instinctive measuring quality in 
his head that the feat would be 
impossible and would result only 
in his own depletion. The gather- 
ing was small. Proceedings began 
with a dry, long-winded recital of 
the observations of the Far Seers, 
confirming once again the great 
threat to life on the planet. When it 
was agreed that the observations of 
the eastern Far Seers read the 
same as the new information 
gathered by Red Earth a period 
of discussion followed. New 
deaths were reported in sad 
pictures. Predictions of still more 
deaths left the gathering moodily 
silent. No one could actually 
believe the verdict of the data, the 



end of life in all the world, but the 
evidence was undeniable. 

‘"Where,” asked a young Far 
Seer attached to the Eastern 
Establishment, “is the hope you 
promised us, Red Earth? The 
Breathers die. The clouds stir 
the accumulated poisons. People 
are perishing.” 

“He is among us,” Red Earth 
said. 

R ack demonstrated. He 
merged, to Beautiful Wings’ 
squirming displeasure, with a 
weakened Power Giver, bringing 
her back to strength. He ate, 
breathed, ‘ stored, demonstrated 
again with an ancient Far Seer, 
who was eased, but who was so 
near^ natural death that Rack 
was unable to do more than give 
him momentary comfort. 

“It is my hope,” Red Earth said, 
“that the power has been latent in 
all Healers. We will listen as Rack 
the Healer explains. Then we 
will try to emulate him.” 

Healers placed their small 
mouths on the odd heads of the 
Far Seers, on the mouths of the 
Power Givers, listening, seeing the 
pictures sent by Rack, who had the 
power. Far &ers observed and 
concluded that the power in Rack 
came from a totally unknown 
section of the mind, a strangely 
shaped area which seemed to be 
missing completely in the other 
Healers. The experiment was 
abandoned. 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



135 




“Nature has sent the New One — 
is it accepted?” Red Earth was an 
impressive figure, a natural 
leader. 

“It is accepted.” 

“Would she send the New One 
without purpose?” 

A chorus of negative, negative. 

“There remains then only the 
problem of finding the purpose,” 
Red Earth said. “And, for some 
time, she has been trying to tell 
us.” He sent a picture of elapsed 
time, measuring back to Rack’s 
trek to the valley of the hot waters. 
Next Red Earth projected the 
exact picture of the object Rack 
had found there. “This object, 
which has been studied by our 
foremost minds, was a message,” 
Red Earth sent. 

Rack, who had been letting his 
mind wander, was brought to full 
attention. He had been unaware 
that such a study had been made. 

“The fact that nature told this 
Healer that it was time to dig — ” 
a shudder of fear passed through 
the assembly — “was also a jnes- 
sage, a message we chose to 
ignore.” Red Earth pushed on 
following a dramatic pause. “In 
the beginning nature imbued the 
Healers with a fascination for 
hard-material nuggets. To them 
they are beauty, wonder, posses- 
sions of esthetic worth, while the 
rest of us consider them useless. 
The reason for this apparent folly 
of nature is now clear. Do you 
see it?” 



He waited. His audience sent 
small, shamed negatives. Rack 
himself was silent, waiting to hear 
Red Earth’s conclusion, trying to 
group his own confused thoughts 
regarding the nuggets, the piece of 
strange material, the whole of it. 

Red Earth continued: “Balanced 
against this curiosity, this yen for 
possession of the nuggets, was the 
ancient knowledge that to dig 
meant death. Thus it was for — ” 
Red Earth sent an incomprehen- 
sibly long picture of time and 
resumed: “yet, even as the planet 
died, nature had long since planted 
our^ salvation. It lay there in the 
valley of the hot waters, a strange 
and wonderful place — for where 
in our tortured world does one find 
clean and pure water, good air, 
soft, unpoisoned soil? This valley 
did not form by accident, but as 
part of nature’s design. For — ” 
again that picture of time — “it has 
been there and Healers have al- 
ways been a restless, wandering 
lot. But no Healer came upon this 
wondrous valley until Rack the 
New One set out on his summer 
explorations on that fateful sun 
circle. Had another Healer come 
upon this valley, he would have 
breathed the air, attended the 
beauty of the place, looked for 
-nuggets — but would he have dug?” 
Red Earth indicated a young 
Healer. “Would you have had the 
courage to go against the ancient 
teaching?” 

“1 fear negative.” 



136 



IF 




“Only the New One would have 
had such daring," Red Earth said. 

Rack, embarrassed, said, "I felt 
that there was no danger. Then, 
too, I didn't dig. It was the water 
that dug." 

“Yet yours was an act of a New 
One," Red Earth continued, 
motioning for Rack to be patient, 
“and it was part of nature’s intri- 
cate design. It was her intent for 
the New One to dig, to find new 
values, to unearth this object." 
He had it in his hand. “And this 
object has been adjudged by our 
best minds not to have its origin on 
this planet." 

Rack felt disappointment. 

“So," Red Earth continued, 
“this message from nature, this 
alien object, has come to us from 
where?" He paused. “A sister 
world? We who can contact such 
worlds know — from the long lag 
in the sending and the receiving by 
our senses — the distances involved. 
Yet there is another world, a 
world much closer, a world that 
spins around our own barely a 
short lag in senses away. The 
long string of events points to one 
thing. This strange object, which 
lay hidden under the soil until 
now, is a message sent by nature 
from that world. Our satellite." 



R ack thought Red Earth’s 
>> theory might have possibili- 
ties. ^ After having searched two 
continents for traces of the Old 



Ones he was prepared to consider 
longer reaches. 

Red Earth went on: “The mes- 
sage isVull of meaning. There is 
life on the satellite, obviously, for 
Rack the Healer’s original conten- 
tion that this is the remnant of a 
crafted object stands. Nothing in 
nature is like it. In this manner we 
are told that there is life on our 
sister world. We are told this in 
conjunction with great events, the 
accelerating pace of death on this 
planet, the emergence of the New 
One. We are all aware of the old 
values. We believe, deep in our 
souls, in the wisdom of nature. 
We know that planets, worlds, 
are the home of life. We know that 
nature in her wisdom makes it 
possible for life to continue. We, 
in our ignorance of her grand 
design, cannot envision the con- 
tinuation of life under the worsen- 
ing conditions — but is she asking 
us for action?" 

Rack remembered his hazy, al- 
most blasphemous thinking in 
regard to the manipulation of the 
environment by man. Red Earth 
himself was now treading on new 
and daring ground. The squirmings 
of the assembly confirmed it. 

“I say she is. I say that she- is 
telling us that we must act now. 
And I say the message is clear. She 
is informing us that there is some 
connection between life on our 
nearest sister world and our own 
survival." 

“If the message is clear to you, 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



137 




Red Earth, I wish you would 
share the knowledge,” said an old 
Far Seer dryly. 

•‘So I shall,” Red Earth retorted. 
‘‘The import of all of these events 
is simple. It is intended that the 
New One and his mate. Beautiful 
Wings the Power Giver, soar to 
the world that rises each night in 
our eastern skies.” 

R ack started. Had the sly old 
^ Far Seer been prying into 
his private fantasies? Around him 
he heard mutters of disbelief. 
Beautiful Wings looked at him, 
a sudden cold fear radiating from 
her mind. 

A doubtful Far Seer named 
Gray Body asked, “If the difficul- 
ties, and there are many, are 
overcome — if the New One reaches 
the satellite and finds life there — 
how will this save us?” 

“If we could fathom nature’s 
ways, we would have all the an- 
swers,” Red Earth said. “Since we 
do not we must ' proceed with 
faith. The object found by the 
New One is my basis for belief. 
The inhabitants of the satellite 
world have crafted the thing with 
a skill far beyond ours. As you 
may know, this material is im- 
pregnable to the acids of the 
atmosphere. It is not workable 
with tools fashioned from the 
Material, h is truly wonderful. 
Contact with such people would 
perhaps provide us with the 
techniques we would need to 



alter the falling survival factor.” 
Red Earth’s questioner sent 
objection. “If this wonderful 
race of people is so advanced, 
why has it not made the far flight 
to our world — rather than wait 
for us to make the contact?” 

“For this,” Red Earth agreed, “I 
have no answer. I merely repeat 
my faith. The events of nature are 
never without logic. Even the 
fatal winter storms follow a 
prescribed pattern imposed by the 
movements of the planet — the tilt 
of the planet on its axis, the posi- 
tion of the satellite and the 
strength of emissions of the sun. 
Not even death is random in 
nature, for it takes the old at the 
prescribed time. I contend that the 
seemingly random happenings, if 
we could but understand them, are 
all a part of the whole. I contend 
that the' nature of the Healers, 
combined with the lure of the 
solid nuggets of hard material, 
the emergence of the New One, 
the conclusions of doom for life 
on our world, are all part of na- 
ture’s scheme to send us into space. 
What we will find there 1 do not 
know.” He paused, continued 
sadly. “It is against my teachings 
and my belief, but we must, in this 
crucial time, consider all possir 
bilities. Perhaps we err in our 
understanding — and 1 project a 
shocking picture, I know. 1 defend 
it from charges of blasphemy on 
the grounds of scientific specula- 
tion. Is it totally inconceivable to 



138 



IF 




think that life, sacred as it is, is 
confined to this planet?” 

It was indeed a shocking 
picture, but the seriousness of the 
times allowed it. 

“Should this^ be so — and 1 pray 
to nature that it is not— then her 
design could be, just could be, to 
pass this life along to a fresh, 
clean, pure-aired world. In short, 
the abilities of Rack the New One 
could be gifted to him for the sole 
purpose of transplanting life 
from this dying planet to a new 
one. How often, in history, does a 
union produce such a lasting rela- 
tionship?” He indicated Rack and 
Beautiful Wings, hand in hand, the 
Power Giver pale and fearful, 
‘its strength can be felt, even 
now.” 

“I cannot accept the possibility 
of ' extinction of life on the 
planet,” said a bold Healer. „ 

“Nor can I,” agreed Red Earth. 
“But can we risk going against 
nature’s obvious directives?” 

“There is merit in your 
thoughts,” sighed the old, wise 
Far Seer who had been given 
momentary relief from the aches 
of old age by Rack. “I will be a 
part of the study.” 

“Welcome,” Red Earth said. 
“For it will take the powers of 
many to prepare such a venture. 
Time will be required. If it were 
possible to send the New One soar- 
ing to the satellite today, 1 would 
be fearful that we were making a 
wrong decision, but we will have 



time to study as we plan. Should 
events occur to prove us wrong we 
will have done nothing more seri- 
ous than waste the time of those 
who have little time remaining. 
Should, for example, nature decree 
a new joining for the New One we 
can but hope for a breeder for his 
offspring to carry his seed. This 
possibility has not been neglected 
in my thinking, but I do not hold 
forth hope. Our recent readings 
indicate that not even the abilities 
of many New Ones would keep 
alive our people in a sufficient 
picture . to carry our civilization 
forward. At best the breeding of 
a new New One from Rack's loins 
would buy us another generation 
of life before the conditions 
wiped out even the New Ones, for 
our conclusions are that the 
worsening of the survival condi- 
tions is irreversible. Still, we 
have lime. Perhaps something will 
be revealed to us. If not, in the end, 
we have only the clear messages. 
Rack the New One and his chosen 
mate. Beautiful Wings, shall 
journey "into the cold of airless 
space in search of the salvation of 
life.” 

He stood silent. When the buz- 
zing thoughts stilled, he sent, “Is 
it agreed?” 

“Affirmative, affirmative,” the 
assembly sent. 

“But you haven’t even asked us 
what we think,” Beautiful Wings 
wailed, picturing death, vast 
empty space, unknown worlds.

“We know you will do your 
duty, whatever it is,” Red Earth 
said soothingly. 

‘Mt is the nature of the Power 
Givers to be fearful,” Rack sent. 
“We will do our duty.” He 
touched her with his armored 
hand, sent his mind to blend with 
hers, quieted her ♦ fears. She, 
feeling his strength, was reassured. 

“Yes,” she said. “We will do our 
duty.”

R ed earth had moved his 
^ site of operations at least 
temporarily to the large dome of 
the Eastern Group EstabNshment. 
Space was need^ to house the 
team which had been put together 
carefully to plan and execute the 
grand, hopeful soar of Rack the 
Healer and Beautiful Wings the 
Power Giver. 

In addition to Rack, Beautiful 
Wings and Red Earth, the group 
consisted of Shadow on the Moon, 
an aptly named young Far 
Seer who had spent much time in 
study of the satellite; Yellow Sky 
the Power Giver, who, to conserve 
the energy of Beautiful Wings, was 
to make some test soars with Rack 
and, for the balancing value of his 
skeptical mind, the ancient Far 
Seer Gray Body. Supplemental 
to these were additional Healers 
and Keepers, the Healers to 
perform any needed goings fbout 



in the forbidding storms, the 
Keepers to assure detailed rec- 
ords x>f the events. Since the 
Eastern Group Establishment had 
to continue' its function as the 
prime source of broth and the 
Material, the extra bodies inside 
the large dome strained the 
available resources and made 
demands on privacy. However, no 
one grumbled. 

“Rack the New One,” Red 
Earth said, “has been responsible 
for creating in my brain a new 
concept of the order of things. In 
his eagerness to prove the existence, 
nay, even the abilities of the Old 
Ones, he set me to speculating 
about the nature of life on this 
world and on our sister worlds. 
On our world, at least in the begin- 
ning, life had many forms. Have 
you ever considered the meaning 
of some of our traditional name 
pictures? For example, that of our 
late brother. Growing Tree the 
Far Seer. His name picture is some- 
thing from the young days of our 
world when the soil was less 
toxic and could support vegetable 
life of an amazing complexity. 
His picture is of a large, growing 
thing, green and fragile. In our 
records one Finds many such 
names, one of the more noted being 
the picture of Rose the Healer. 
His name picture suggests some- 
thing of beauty, a bright, fragile, 
short-lived thing of the soil. Some 
of our other traditional names 
suggest that there was, in addition 



140 



IF 




to vegetation, life of other sorts 
in the youthful days of the planet. 
Flying things. Indeed, our own 
Juicers show vestigial wings. And 
the young of the Juicers are 
wing^ before their change. It is 
reasonable, then, to think that 
nature adjusts her life to planetary 
conditions, providing variety for 
the sake of beauty and perhaps 
for some practical purpose un- 
known to us. She also makes her 
changes as conditions alter in the 
accepted order of decay. She 
does not, I believe, destroy life, 
but alters its forms, utilizing 
the life force. Some believe that 
there is a measurable quantity 
of life allotted to each world. 
Should this be true, then the life 
force which lives in our bodies 
could have, in the past, furnished 
animation to beings beyond our 
imagination. At this stage of 
our world’s development life is 
concentrated in a small picture 
of forms— the four forms of us, 
the two of insects and the com- 
bination of vegetation and animal 
which is the Breather. To think 
of the logic of this arrangement 
is to accept the concept of infall- 
ible nature. You may point to the 
poison things of the sink holes and 
question this statement, but who 
is to say that those poison things 
do not have a place in the future 
of life? We do not know the 
exact form of the Old Ones, but we 
do know that the change was a 
drastic one from Old One to the 



first Healer. Our New One, the 
logical advancement of nature, 
assuming that Rack the Healer’s 
change is incomplete and will be 
perfected in some future birth, 
could be so radically different as 
to be able to utilize the poison 
things of the sink holes for his 
own good.” 

“It would, indeed, seem that 
nothing is random in nature,” 
agreed Gray Body, the old Far 
Seer. “But in restating it. Red 
Earth, my brother, are you not 
seeking to ease the doubts in your 
mind regarding our present course 
of action?” 

“I shall not deny certain mis- 
givings,” Red Earth said. “Some 
of them are not in keeping with 
logic, for the pain I feel when I 
think of losing the presence of 
two of my fellow beings is purely 
emotional and not at all fitting 
for the logical mind of a Far 
Seer.” 

“You will not lose, but gain,” 
Rack said. “For the success of 
our journey will bring changes. 
We, having replenished our stores 
dn the new, sweet world, will re- 
turn, bringing to you the wisdom 
of our brothers there.” 

“It pleases me to think so,” Red 
Earth said. 

“The thought of such a journey 
is, of course, pleasing to a Healer, 
who is notoriously footloose,” 
Gray Body sent. “And I fear that 
one possible outcome of this 
venture is to be measured only in 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



141 




the pleasures received by those 
involved, a Healer who will sec 
more of the universe than any 
Healer before him, a Power Giver 
who is to make a soar that will 
diminish all past soars. Should you 
find an empty world there— and 
no wise brothers — you will still 
be tempted to return, for it is 
horrible to imagine an empty 
world. Then what will you bring 
us?” 

“Yes,” Red Earth agreed. 
“Should you discover a world 
empty of intelligent life, then you 
must suffer the loneliness. You 
must stay. You will breed, for 
nature will not let life die on two 
worlds. You will tint again and 
give birth and tint again to 
produce breeding couples to 
people the new world. We must 
believe so.” 

“But if we can accept this 
blasphemy,” asked one of the 
Healers, “then should we not also 
entertain other blasphemies and 
at least consider random factors 
as such?” 

Red Earth said, ‘‘We come once 
again to faith. Compare the 
early pictures of this world, the 
fruitful, varied forms of life, the 
rich, sweet air and the variety of 
foods. Consider the pictures in 
the Book of Rose the Healer of the 
Old Ones dying in vast pictures of 
bodies— compare those with the 
small picture of our ' population. 
Is it not logical, assuming that 
there is a constant life force. 



that we, as individuals, are 
allotted a larger picture of life force 
than was allotted to the Old Ones, 
thus explaining our superiority? 
Is it not possible that there is a life 
force on a new, empty world, 
waiting to inhabit the body of 
life? One of the possibilities is that 
Rack and Beautiful Wings will 
find an empty planet, true. But 
it is just as l^lievable to think that 
nature awaits them with a 
reserve of life force which, once 
absorbed, will make them more 
than they are.” 

“Your faith makes me feel 
humble,” said Gray Body. 

“What else is there?” Rack 
asked. ‘J share Red Earth’s faith. 
Nature has never deserted us. She 
has given us good life in the past, 
with pockets of sweet air and 
quantities of broth. She has 
made us thinking beings who can 
see beauty. A mother will not 
abandon her children.” 

“It is time,” Red Earth said, 
“to leave our speculation and 
apply ourselves to the task at 
hand.. Shadow on the Moon, the 
youngest Far Seer who studies 
the satellite, will outline some of 
the difficulties.” 

S HADOW on the Moon, agi- 
tated by the attention, began 
his presentation. “Our senses tell 
us of large mountains and 
valleys. We think — since on our 
world the rains and the winds 
have eaten our mountains — that 



142 



IF 




this fact alone assures a supply of 
good air, for uneroded mountains 
indicate a youthful world. Thus 
we anticipate no difficulty once the 
satellite is reached. The dangers 
lie in the journey through airless 
space. For there the particles are so 
scattered, so few, that not even 
the lungs of a powerful Healer such 
as Rack could find breath. 
Enough air must be stored for 
Rack and his Power Giver to 
sustain life for—” He sent a picture 
of days that startled Rack. 

‘‘It is not within the power of 
Rack the Healer,” he said. 

“So,” Shadow on the Moon 
went on, “it is necessary to 
provide a store of air and food. I 
have considered the possibilities. 
To pack so much would entail a 
pack of—” He pictured an 
unwieldy proportion. “This being 
undesirable, I have suggested an 
alternate course.” He sent a 
picture of a small establishment, 
constructed of the Material, 
complete with Breather tanks and 
broth vessels. 

“The bulk will be far too 
great,” Rack said, thinking of 
the drain on Beautiful Wings. ' 

“Ordinarily, yes,” Shadow on 
the Moon said. “But there are 
certain differences between a 
soar such as we contemplate and 
a simple soar within the range of 
our planet’s pull.” He indicated 
Beautiful Wings. “Your senses tell 
you of the nature of the force 
which surrounds our world. Can 



you picture the extent of the 
force?” 

She concentrated. “I have never 
considered it. 1 have soared high, 
but I have not felt any diminishing 
of the power that tugs me back.” 

“There is greater perceptivity 
through the senses of a Far Seer.” 
Red Earth said. 

“We, too, can see the force of 
our planet,” Shadow on the Moon 
said. “We cannot utilize it, as dp 
the Power Givers, but our sight 
extends into the' airlessness of 
space. There, at certain distances, 
we note a decrease in the power. It 
is therefore our contention, after 
careful study, that less power would 
be required farther out. We see a 
similar force surrounding the 
satellite — a smaller force because 
it is a smaller world. Past a certain 
point a Power Giver could cease 
her work, allowing the pull of 
the sister world to furnish the 
motive power.” 

“But,” said Beautiful Wings, 
“in my idle play I have, fallen 
when I have not used my power. 
If I allow myself to fall for too 
long the power needed to stop is 
far greater than the power ne^ed 
for a simple soar.” 

“True. That, too, is in our 
thoughts,” Shadow on the Moon 
said. “We ^must measure the 
force needed. For this I suggest 
practice soars. We measure the 
force of our planet’s pull and 
compare it with that of the sister 
world. Then we shall know the 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



143 




power needed to stop the soar. 
It will be great, perhaps too great, 
for the soar in airless space must 
be faster than any we know.” He 
pictured the drop and once again 
Rack was awed. 



T here were other difficulties. 

As the plans were made they 
seemed to grow until they burdened 
Rack’s mind. The vast picture of 
distance intimidated him, made 
him fear, though less for himself 
than for Beautiful Wings. Never 
before had such a great demand 
been made on the gifts of a Power 
Giver. And as the workers con- 
structed the small establishment 
that would protect the soarers from 
the cold airlessness . of space — 
Rack watched and weighed with 
his mind and despaired. 

However, he did his duty. He 
stored by eating far more than his 
usual amount, breathing the rich. 
Breather-made air until his cells — 
and the new cells added in the form 
of surplus — were fat with air. He 
felt bulky, but he knew that each 
bit of added reserve gave him that 
rhuch more to share with Beautiful 
Wings. 

To cover all eventualities it was 
decided that an attempt should 
be made to teach Rack and 
Beautiful Wings the techniques of 
food and Material making. Eggs 
of the Webbers and the Juicers 
would be stored in the flying es- 
tablishment to be hatched, should 



they find an empty but clean-aired 
world. Tending the sources of the 
materials that made the Material 
was Far Seer responsibility, but 
Rack went at the lessons with a 
will. The insects, accustomed only 
to the mind patterns of the Far 
Seers, were made restless at 
first by the presence of others. 
Rack studied the soothing pat- 
terns sent by the Far Seers, 
duplicated them, became at ease 
with the hairy Webbers. He 
carefully stayed out of reach of the 
vicious stingers of the Juicers, but 
managed to master the technique 
of milking the creatures. It was 
up to Beautiful Wings to use her 
power to combine the two 
extracts and after much experi- 
mentation she was partially 
successful. Red Earth assured her 
that before departure date she 
would be as adept at making 
Material and at brewing broth 
as a Far Seer. 

Meanwhile the flying establish- 
ment had been completed, stocked 
with Breathers and was waiting. 
The group gathered. Rack and 
Beautiful Wings entered, closed the 
lock, lay on the comfortable rack. 
He merged with her and she lifted, 
her area of power enclosing the 
establishment, lifting it to the 
ceiling of the dome and holding it 
there effortlessly, with Rack’s 
substance and power funneling 
through their blended flesh to heal 
and help. Rack was encouraged, 
for^he flying establishment added 



144 



IF 




only a tiny picture to the drain on 
their joint resources. 

It was time to test the drain in 
actual soaring. For this Yellow 
Sky the Power Giver, young and 
considered beautiful, was to be 
united with Rack — by decree of the 
Far Seers. Yellow Sky did not 
hide her delight at the prospect. 

“I fail to understand why, if I 
am to be the one who makes the 
soar, I cannot go with you,” 
Beautiful Wings vehemently pro- 
tested to Rack. 

“We must conserve your 
resources,” Red Earth said 
impatiently when her protest 
reached him. 

Beautiful Wings, sending half- 
concealed pictures of jealousy, 
watched as Rack touched his 
tongue to the tongue of Yellow 
Sky, merged, began his magic and 
the flying establishment was lifted 
rapidly into the dark, swirKng 
clouds. Rack sent back pictures of 
his condition and the condition 
of the Power Giver to the minds 
of the Far Seers. The establish- 
ment burst through the clouds into 
the blackness of the upper air. 
Yellow Sky had taken them up 
swiftly, as if to prove to all that 
she, as well as Beautiful Wings, 
could power the soar. Rack, in 
contact with Shadow on the 
Moon, directed her to slow down 
and hover. 

Motionless, the flying enclosure 
was almost invisible against the 
space beyond it, other Power 



Givers reported. The view below 
was blocked by the most terrible 
winter storms in history. Rack had 
a foretaste of loneliness. Yet he 
and Yellow Sky were not alone, 
for the minds of the Far Seers held 
them, checked them, measured 
their expenditure of substance. 

Exultant, not penalized in the 
slightest by the fast, heavy lift, 
the Power Giver radiated joy. 
Rack, however, was slighty un- 
comfortable. His mouth to hers, 
his tongue-flesh merged with hers, 
he knew the vague unease that 
always came to him in a merge with 
anyone other than Beautiful 
Wings. He was relieved when the 
Far Seers had enough information 
to allow the soar to end. He 
sought seclusion immediately 
within his chamber at the Eastern 
Establishment. 

That he was being selflsh did not 
occur to him until Beautiful Wings 
entered softly. He looked up, ar- 
ranging his features into an expres- 
sion denoting pleasure. 

“Did you not even want to see 
me?” she asked. 

“Of course,” he said. “I was 
merely tired.” 

“Yet we have soared the wide 
sea without fatigue,” she reminded 
him. 

She was defenseless against his 
probing mind. Their long closeness 
had robbed her of the ability to 
close her mind to him. He 
entered. What he found hurt him. 
“You are the most foolish of 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



145 




Power Givers,” he told her with a 
gentle fondness. “Do you think 
1 could forget so quickly?” He 
sent pictures of the repeated 
joining and she melted, coming to 
touch him. 

“1 will not allow you to merge 
with her again,” she said. 

He laughed. “Then you shall be 
the one who explains it to Red 
Earth.” But he sent such a wave of 
love that she purred aloud. 

S INCE it was proven that the 
flying establishment could be 
soared relatively easily only a 
few tests remained. With Beautiful 
Wings trying to be unconcerned, 
but not t^ing successful in hiding 
her pique from Rack, the load was 
lifted once more by Yellow Sky. 
At the height of the soar, in the 
thin air of near space, they 
hovered. Under the guidance of the 
mind of Shadow on the Moon the 
flying establishment moved in 
an arc corresponding to the curve 
of the planet. Faster and faster it 
was pushed. Rack sending his 
energies into the body of the 
Power Giver. Just as the contact 
wks about to be broken by the 
curvature of the planet they 
were told to slow, make a sweeping 
turn, come back. Then the es- 
tablishment moved up, up, at an 
increasing rate of speed — the 
strain was felt even in Rack's 
strong body. 

They returned to find excitement 
in the minds of the Far Seers. The 



reason was the relative reading of 
power expended in the two methods 
of gaining speed. One more test 
was required to confirm the 
thinking of the Far Seers. And to 
the relief of Beautiful Wings it 
was decided to use the team that 
would make the final long soar. 

Rack found joy in being merged 
once again with Beautiful Wings. 
He knew her as he knew no other 
person, knew the vibrant life 
force of her, the gladness with 
which she merged, the inner 
workings of her organs, the 
miraculous beauty of her cellular 
structure. His mind sang with 
hers as she lifted the thin bubble 
through the toxic clouds to the 
bright sunlight, the cold, thin 
air. Up and up they went slowly, 
conserving energy. And then they 
followed the curve of the planet. 
Just before contact was lost the 
mind of Shadow on the Moon 
directed them to level, engage the 
power of Beautiful Wings’ mind, 
push the flying establishment 
faster, faster. 

There was no sensation of speed. 
Blocked by the curve of the home 
planet from the mind of the Far 
Seer, they relied on an instinctive 
sense of timing to halt the force, 
to rest light and free as their bodies 
floated ^ gently from the rack. 
Disengaged, they examined the 
situation. The senses of the 
Power Giver felt the pull from 
below, but felt also another force 
that counteracted it, kept the 



146 



IF 




flying establishment circling the 
planet at a far height^ no energies 
being expended. They entered the 
dark of a space night, emerged into 
the sun, the minds of the Far 
Seers coming into contact, 
measuring jubilantly. 

After another circle of the 
planet at a speed never before at- 
tained they came down, the mind of 
the Power Giver breaking’ the 
unseen force that had held them 
at an equal distance from the 
planet’s surface, then letting the 
pull of the planet drag them down, 
down, to slow and settle to the 
planet. 

Rack had difficulty understand- 
ing the pictures in the minds of the 
Far Seers. But Beautiful Wings, 
whose instinctive knowledge of 
planet fields and pull was inbred, 
grasped the pictures easily. To- 
gether, minds blended, they would 
be able to follow the exact instruc- 
tions of the Far Seers. Moreover, 
throughout the early stages of the 
soar, they would be in mind 
contact with Shadow on the 
Moon. In his mind the wheelings 
of the worlds were precise pictures 
and his logic' could send the 
pictures ahead in time to anticipate 
the exact location of the sister 
worlds at any given moment. He 
had come up with a daring 
theory to save energy. Upon the 
approach to the sister world the 
flying establishment would be 
speeding through space at a huge 
picture of velocity. Having 



measured the strength of the 
power used by Beautiful Wings and 
other Power Givers in stopping the 
fall of their own bodies toward the 
planet, he pictured the force needed 
to slow the flying establishment 
wfth the weight of Rack and 
Beautiful Wings , inside. To stop 
the motion would cost dearly if 
Beautiful Wings forced herself 
directly against the satellite and 
came to a direct landing. Shadow 
on the Moon thought it possible to 
allow the pull of the satellite itself 
to slow the soar. Rack tried hard 
to capture the concept, but it 
was difficult. He left such tech- 
nicalities to the Far Seers and 
Power Givers, confident that they 
were right when they said that 
the flying establishment should 
not aim directly at the satellite, but 
nearby, swinging past to allow the 
pull of the world to slow the for- 
ward motion, curve it into a circle 
around the satellite. From that 
point power would be used spar- 
ingly to slow the motfon and allow 
the tug of the satellite to bring 
the establishment down to a site 
selected by Rack and Beautiful 
Wings. 

Preparations were complete. 
Qn a dark night in the low end of 
the sun circle, with the howling 
storms lifting all the settled heavy 
gases into the already toxic 
atmosphere, the group gathered 
and listened to a recital of the 
deaths of the season. There were 
blank spaces in the thin web of 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



147 




life force around the continent. 
Death stalked the world and 
dampened the anticipation of the 
great event. The aching knowledge 
of loss added a sense of urgency 
to the last-minute activity as 
Healers stored good air and broth 
in the flying establishment, placed 
fresh, healthy Breathers in the 
tanks, stored the eggs of the 
Webbers and Juicers in their 
containers. 

Sleepless, Rack lay with his 
armored hand on the flank of 
Beautiful Wings. He felt her shift 
in sleep, heard the sound of her 
lungs using the good, sweet air. 
The place was quiet, work at a 
halt. Through the thin walls 

he could h^ar the sigh of the winds. 
On his scales he could feel the 
occasional particle that made its 
way through the resistance of the 
walls. He wished for the abilities 
of the Far Seers, so that he could 
send his mind up beyond the 

lowering clouds to feel the swing 
of the worlds. 

' He considered his life and it 
was good. He had seen much, 

done much. His was the greatest 
adventure ever given to Healer 

and the fate of his world hung on 
him. But he was Rack the Healer, 
young, strong, confident. He did 
not know fear.

r HIS is the Book of Rack the 
Healer, called the New One, 



sent back to the minds of the Keep- 
ers from a point where the planet is 
a yellow-purple brightness, round 
and good and beautiful These are 
the thoughts of Rack, sent from 
space. For my daughter, the 
Keeper, whose name I do not know, 
who can store and keep but who can 
never know me. For those we love, 
Red Earth and Shadow on the 
Moon and Gray Body, Far Seers 
of great knowledge. For those who 
helped, for Yellow Sky the Power 
Giver and for our brothers and 
sisters on the Eastern Continent, 
whom we greet. Our thoughts 
travel to them as well as^io our 
homeland, for here, where the 
planet is a smallness below us, our 
thoughts spread easily through the 
clear vastness, the cold, the growing 
picture of distance. 

Know you, my brothers, my sis- 
ters, that your force is felt even 
here. Tender but strong emotions 
follow us, making us feel the life 
force, labeling our world as one of 
the favored of nature, one on which 
the life force glows brightly. 

We are abje even now to feel the 
reassuring warmth of the combined 
minds of you. Red Earth, and you. 
Shadow On the Moon, and you. 
Gray Body. We know at what cost 
you are sending us your guidance, 
for the distance is great and the sky 
is thick with poisons. 

And before we pass beyond the 
strength of our weak powers, be- 
yond that point where our com- 
bined sendings are lost to the com- 
bined listenings of the best minds

IF 




of our world, /, Rack the Healer, 
presume to speak ^ to clutter the 
vaults of the Keepers* minds with 
my thoughts in the hope that future 
generations might gain from our 
experience. 

You have seen the deadly yellows 
and the dark, swirling air. You 
have, some of you, received the gift 
of a high soar, have risen beyond 
the obscuring darkness into light to 
see the universe with its depths of 
black and its sparkles of suns. For 
you I view the scene, sending it to 
be recorded forever. The roundness 
of the planet is becoming sharper 
in outline as we rise. The cold is 
even now beginning to be felt inside 
our establishment. / fpel it for all. / 
ruffle my scales, making them re- 
ceive the direct rays of the sun, 
feeling its hard particles bounce and 
send energy into me, feeling the 
warmth which is not felt in the air 
of the establishment, but which I 
use and share with the one who, 
welded to me flesh on flesh, uses 
her wondrous mind to lift us, uses 
my strength to fly. We leave the 
dying world behind. The night of 
space is black in the circle of my 
eyes and the sun a brightness which, 
without the protection of my outer 
lids, I cannot endure. 

Even as I send and record my 
poor thoughts alongside those of 
my betters, I receive and obey the 
learned thinking of the Far Seers 
guiding our soar. Now the forces 
equalize and we float effortlessly 
above the clouds, which from this 



vantage point lose their deadliness 
and are merely beautiful mottles of 
color, making the planet invisible 
to our eyes. 

Into the cold shadow of the 
planet we fly and / feel the slowness 
of my blood and gii^e of my warmth 
to the differently gifted Power 
Giver. I am measuring time and 
when, at the precise moment de- 
termined by the mind of Shadow on 
the Moon, we surge, using all our 
combined power, I bid you, my 
world, temporary farewell and send 
you my love and ask yours in re- 
turn. For we are not of this world 
now but from it, in the hostile vast- 
ness of space, an emptiness that 
makes the airless plains of glass 
seem like paradise. 

Ah, to see the world not be- 
low, but out there, seemingly close 
enough to touch. To see it shrink 
and become a glove of yellowish- 
purple and to watch the march of 
the giant winter storms. The air 
swirls into a circle covering the 
southern seas, where the Breathers 
grow. The sun, harsh, unpitying, 
lashes all, glares, reflects. 

And there we see the satellite, our 
goal. We are pushing toward it, 
using our power, feeling the drain. 
We rest, eat, refresh ourselves. And 
then we push again and I feek^the 
accumulated fat of my system being 
used, feel myself shrinking — I am 
the old Rack, trim, hard. Still we 
push and there is no sensation of 
speed or movement. We know only 
by the resistance to our power that

shrinking planet behind us. iVe will 
push for a period of time and then 
rest. 

E ARE alone and the loneli- 
ness is terrible. We know now 
that life loves life and needs its 
presence. Experience our loneliness 
with us and value your fellows. For 
here is no friendly life glow from 
the next establishment — only emp- 
tiness, a vast void. X 

And as wf drift, moving at a 
speed which is beyond my meager 
comprehension, as the minds of our 
friends grow feeble in the distance, 
I exult, for surely we shall achieve 
our goal and bring continued life to 
our world. 

/ sing the song of Rack the 
Healer, called the New One, asking 
the indulgence of my brothers and 
sisters, for we are lonely and we are 
so vast a distance from the glow 
of life and our homes and even as 
we trust in the goodness of nature 
we fear. 

I sing of my love, of Beautiful 
Wings the Power Giver, with whom 
/ have joined in repetition to pro- 
duce the life of a Keeper, thus 
contributing to the balance of 
nature. / sing of her beauty, for she 
is a Power Giver among Power 
Givers and blessed with a sense of 
joy in sharing my love. I sing of our 
union, for it lasted past the tinting 
and became deep. I sing of our to- 
getherness as we merge to let me 
share with her and heal the 



damages of raw sunlight. I sing of 
her delicate scales, of flashing 
colors and her slim legs of strength 
and her arms of warmth and her 
pink-tinged gills which remind me 
of the glory of her tinting. / in- 
scribe her name on the records of 
Qur race, to be remembered, for she 
risked much. She soared into the 
poison of the winter storms to find 
me, saving me for herself and for 
this, for myself and for life. 

I sing of Red Earth the Far Seer, 
who did his duty, which was to 
attend the ancient laws, thus fol- 
lowing nature*s design and leading 
to this. May his life be long with 
many moments of pleasure with 
young and beautiful Keepers. To 
him I entrust my memory, my 
establishment, my nuggets of hard 
material — and may he find beauty 
in them, for beauty is nature s gift 
to all, not simply to Healers. 

/ sing of Shadow on the Moon 
the Far Seer, whose wisdow lifted 
us, guided us, whose strong mind 
still comforts us. And of Gray 
Body the Far Seer, whose doubts 
made us think and work harder to 
seek this opportunity to do good 
for the race. I sing of Yellow Sky 
the Power Giver and remember 
gratefully her soars with me and I 
send her my thanks and my love 
and a wish for an early tinting and a 
production of life. 

I sing of the cold of space, which 
slows my thoughts. I sing of the 
hard sun, which glares and burns 
and makes ashes gather on my 




150 



IF 




scales: the cruel sun, from which I 
shield Beautiful Wings with my 
stronger body. I sing of the growing 
sister world with its brightness and 
shadows. It looms there, waiting, 
waiting, with its gifts. 

/ sing, reluctantly, of my doubts. 
/ am weak and I fear and think of 
finding emptiness. 

But should such disaster overtake 
us weep not for Rack the Healer 
and Beautiful Wings the Power 
Giver, for we have enjoyed much 
and have known the awesome 
wheelings of the worlds from afar. 
Think then only that this was a 
folly of man, not of nature, for the 
faith is kept as long as the life force 
is vibrant on our world. 

I sing of my hope. / sing of an- 
ticipated greetings from brothers 
and sisters on our sister world in a 
place of sweet air and plentiful food 
and undiminished life. I sing of our 
return to bring hope and word of 
renewal. I sing, alternately, of 
loneliness, of two of us alone on a 
vast world, building life, if that be 
ordained. 

/ add my thoughts to those of 
Rose the Healer, who was young 
with our race. Rose the Healer said 
that the bodies of the Old Ones 
littered the Earth, leading me to 
think that nature at times can be 
cruel. I wish I could have seen the 
world as it was, young, with grow- 
ing things and multiple forms of 
life. Perhaps we, at the end of our 
journey, will find such a place, re- 
plenish ourselves, return to you 
with many secrets. And as I dream. 



I dream of moving the race to this 
fresh, new world where ho one 
wants for air and the gentle sun 
warms even the frail, unprotected 
hides of the youngest and most 
tender. 

Many questions assault my niind. 
Will there be a powerful life force 
on this new world to make me 
strong enough to soar across the 
emptiness and carry on my own 
back all life to this new beginning? 

Our Breathers die, but the supply 
will be ample, for we pass from the 
pull of the home world to the tug of 
the new growing steadily ahead of 
us, and the senses of my love feel it. 
It is a confirmation of the power of 
the mind to find that the thoughts 
of Shadow on the Moon the Far 
Seer were accurate. 

We burn and freeze. My scales 
coat themselves with ash. It 
clutters the establishment, ^ is 
breathed and expelled through our 
gills. 

5 !ADL Y I sing of the weakness of 
my love. For she is used, even 
with my healing. The strain, as we 
apply our power to slow ourselves 
slightly, is felt to the core of my 
deepest cells, for I have used my 
reserves and feel myl weight go 
down as we face the pull of the new 
world. 

I will breathe deeply of the air 
and eat of the broth held in reserve. 
I will send my strength into her, 
healing her, bringing her back, for 
I weep with her wasted substance

and, for the first time, doubt our 
combined wisdom. For had we not 
chosen to venture into this vast 
cold we would be snugly estab- 
lished amid the storms blowing. 
Selfishly / dream of wasted time, 
the time allotted to us even with a 
world dying about us, for we would 
have lived and blended our minds 
for our given span. We would have 
lived the memory of our union and, 
nature willing, might have been 
blessed with another. 

/ recall how in a northern estab- 
lishment, with the frost sparkling 
on the earth, we joined. We tinted. 
She flowered. Her breast buds were 
tender and sweet and / saw them 
suckled by our issue, by the Keeper 
whose name / do not know . 

Weakened, we near our goal. It 
is fortunate that we calculated 
enough stored air. Just enough 
broth. Just so many Breathers, for 
the load has been great and the 
cold has drained us and ahead is 
the final surge of power. I rest 
fitfully. / dream that my love tints, 
that / tint. I see her scales flower- 
ing and see the emergence of the 
ruby beauty from deep within her. 

I dream, waking. 

No. She tints. My love tints. In 
her weakness there is about her 
lower regions a definite tint and a 
hint of flowering on the chest. 
Bless nature. Bless nature. It could 
only be nature*s plan. I will tint. I 
feel it. I feel the preliminary tin- 
glings. Below, on a new world, we 
will find a union. It is nature* s will. 



Sadly I wonder. Are we then to 
stay, to build a life force on this 
new world? 

We sing and the voices of our 
minds are weak for traveling far, 
hopefully to be gathered in by the 
com bing strength of the Far Seers. 

We are behind the satellite, 
hidden from our home planet. 

Farewell. Farewell. We will 
lower now to find our destiny. 

XIII 

APPENDED to the Book of Rack 
J\. the New One by Red Earth 
the Far Seer, my thoughts. The 
principle of interplanetary soaring 
is proven and praise is due to the 
work of all who were involved, but 
especially to Shadow on the Moon 
the Far Seer who sensed the move- 
ments of the worlds to such an 
accurate degree that the soar was 
made within the tolerance of our 
measurements. 

I, Red Earth the Far Seer, now 
record the time in pictures of sun 
circles, satellite movements and 
tilt of the planet. I record the 
duration of the soar in terms of the 
rising and Tailing sun. I record 
minute cell counts and am amazed. 
Rack is, truly, the New One, for the 
expenditure of his substance was 
beyond the endurance of any 
Healer. 

I record that the foregoing final 
segment of the Book of Rack the 
Healer was received by the com- 
bined minds of the Far Seers much 



152 



IF 




as it is recorded, with interpolations 
by Deep Diver the Healer. These 
were necessary due to the weakness 
of the thoughts from far space, 
received sporadically and some- 
times altered by the toxic storms. 
Yet it is felt that we have preserved 
the essence of the thoughts of Rack 
the New One. 

We wait. The survival factor 
allows little outside activity and the 
food stores dwindle, but there is a 
new beginning always — and with 
each new beginning there is hope. 

As 1 wait I record the thoughts 
that haunt me. 1 am especially 
impressed by one of the last clear 
thoughts received. That tinting was 
in process is beyond doubt, for the 
excitement strengthened Rack’s 
thoughts and made them clear. 1 
speculate. Could this mean that 
nature’s plan is to establish life on 
the new world? 

To myself and to^ the private 
banks of my Keeper I confess that 
this is my belief, as indeed it was all 
along. Old beliefs die hard and all 
my hope springs up to think that 
they will return with information, 
with ways of keeping life on the 
world. Yet the indications, the 
tinting, the reported weakness of 
the Power Giver, all tend to con- 
vince me that the new one was born 
out of nature’s design to transplant 
the seed of life from this dying 
world to another. 

But there is another fear. We re- 
ceived the thought of a clearly 
visible world. This is strange, for 



air in all recorded history has been 
dense with clouds. We know that 
clouds contain many substances, 
most of which are of little or no use 
to life. But what if, in nature’s in- 
comprehensible overall plan, those 
substances that cloud the air serve 
some small purpose? Would it be 
possible for life to exist and merge 
and produce more life in a com- 
pletely clean-aired world? 

I would have breathed easier had 
there been a report of moderate 
cloud cover on our sister planet. 

I can send out my senses, pene- 
trate the clouds, cover the vast 
distance to the satellite in a span of 
time only a tiny picture of the time 
consumed by the soar. I can then 
feel the response bouncing back and 
measure the density of the soil of 
the satellite and it is^ soil, rock, 
solidity. I cannot penetrate to the 
depths. 1 cannot detect the presence 
or lack of air or water or any other 
substance. 1 cannot, of course, de- 
tect the minute forms of life there. 
Rack the New One and Beautiful 
Wings the Power Giver. 

I can only wait. 

Perhaps, in time, other New Ones 
may spring forth. We search all the 
new-born Healers, trying to detect 
that strange, new area of the brain 
which gives Rack the New One his 
ability to merge physically with 
another. We find nothing. We have 
sacrificed the best sun circles of the 
life of a Power Giver to carry a 
message to our brothers across the 
sea, telling them of the New One, 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



153 




warning them to be on the lookout 
for others. 

We wait. We can couple with our 
Keepers and forget for a short span 
of time, but there is always the out- 
side, the growing toxicity, the dimin- 



ishing survival factor. And we wait. 

It is more and more evident that 
the fate of all life on this planet is 
dependent on the findings of Rack 
the New One in the distant reaches 
of space.

ADMIRAL, I know thfe is highly 
JHL irregular, but you know me 
from way back. You’ve always 
said that I didn’t like to follow the 
system and that is explanation 
enough, I suppose, for the rank I 
hold. 1 like to think I’m a man who 
dislikes the planetary piles of red 
tape that have been thrown up 
around Exploration and Alien 
Search work. 

1 know you’re already saying, 
Same old Brad. I guess you’re 
right. I’ve been known to go out 
on a limb. Remember the time 1 
called a three-buck pass in the 
championship game between the 
Academy and Xanthos U? We 
lost, but it was because some little 
bastard on the Xanthos team mis- 
sed his assignment and was in the 
wrong grid and the ball hit him 
right in the chest, but then I’ve al- 
ways been a high roller, haven’t I? 

Jack, I’m not used to this type 
of communication. I don’t like 



looking into those glassy little 
eyes in front of me. I hope you’ll 
excuse my appearance. I’m just 
in from planetside. 

I really don’t know where to 
start. Maybe I should begin about 
75,000 New Years back. 1 know 
you’re a student of history, but 
please be patient with me. I 
remember having to crib from your 
notes to get ready for the final 
exams, so my trying to refresh your 
memory on history is not the idea. 
I just need to ramble a little until I 
get this thing straight in my mind. 

This is a little more than a lower 
rank imposing on his superior. 
You owe me because you’re the 
bastard, if you’ll pardon the fa- 
miliarity, Admiral, who talked me 
into X&A in the first place when I 
had my mind set on Intersystem 
Transport, where the loot is. You 
turned me on with that summer trip 
to old Terra II. Damn, my back 
sits up and aches when I think of 
the digging we did. Remember? 
We were camped there on that 
ruined world j>eside a river that had 
been killed and never had the 



156 



IF 




chance to come back to life. We 
speculated about what kind of junk 
they dumped into it— so much of it 
that the stream still hadn’t come 
back to life a few millennia after 
the last people had given up trying 
to revive the world and left it for 
greener places. We couldn’t believe 
it was possible to kill a planet, but 
there was the living proof and we 
decided that it was a phase we went 
through as a race. 1 remember how 
the soil had all been eroded away 
and how the rock stuck through 
like bare bones and how there was 
almost no vegetation. 

But Jack, dead as Terra II was, 
there was life on her. There were 
crawling things and flying things 
and there was air, even if it did 
stink. 

I’ve had a lot of time, during 
these past few weeks, while that 
fruity little telepath, Janti, you 
stuck me with has been lifting the 
skulls of these poor bastards on this 
godforsaken little planet, to think 
and remember what we talked 
about. We talked about the destiny 
of the race and we always went 
back, if you remember, to that big 
question of who the hell are we? 

You’re supposed to stop asking 
that question when you leave the 
college soph coffee tables, but I 
think, the whole X&A program is 
just another way of phrasing it. 
I’m amazed that we are not able to 
answer the question. Hell, we’ve 
been in space for thirty thousand 
years and we still don’t know 



whether or not we had parents or 
whether we were just laid out on a 
flat rock in the sun somewhere. 

I ’VE been thinking about the 
way you explained our inability 
to trace our racial origin. You said 
that the average man can’t even tell 
you his great-grandfather’s name 
and damn it, you were right. 1 
couldn’t tell you mine. You said 
that it wasn’t strange to think that a 
race might forget or lose track of 
its origin over some 75,000 N.Y. 
You laughed at me when I went 
back to the Academy and started 
digging into the records to trace 
my ancestry back a few generations. 
You said that all the trouble could 
have been saved if one of my an- 
cestors had taken the trouble to 
write down the names of his and 
passed the list down to his kids and 
so on. But no one thought of that 
in my family and no one thought of 
it in the race. We have only some 
old legends. We came from space. 
That much is sure. We’ve done 
enough work on the home planet, 
old Terra II — and the name alone 
is indicative of the fact that 
there must have been a Terra I — to 
know that until we came tfiere and 
unloaded a regular zoo of life on 
her, she was a barren planet. Life 
began on Terra II 75,000 N.Y. ago. 

And on all the other planets 
we’ve settled in 30,000 N.Y. we’ve 
found enough life to Till a thimble 
if we collected all of it. 

Now we’ve hit the jackpot. Jack. 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



157 




I had to laugh when I Tilled in that 
ofTicial report. I’ve done it a hun- 
dred times and I’ve never had any- 
thing to write into the life questions 
other than a few facts about some 
weird bugs and some crazy plants. 
And this is a good indication of the 
fact that I’m not all wrong when I 
say that there’s too much red tape 
in the program. How many hun- 
dreds of sheets of blinkstat paper 
have been wasted with those blank 
pages regarding life? How much 
does it cost to blink a stat from four 
hundred light-years away down to 
headquarters? 

But that’s not the point. The 
point is, we thought that there 
Would be a time when those blanks 
regarding life on a new planet 
would be needed. Or we hoped so. 

Man, it sent a chill through me 
when I inked it in: lifetype: Class 
1-B Humanoid. And I can feel the 
vibrations caused by those words 
all the way out here. I’ll bet my 
report has been fingered by every- 
one from old George Borne down 
to the office boy in X&A Head- 
quarters and I’ll bet there are some 
paranoid types who are messing 
their pants. I’ve got a pretty good 
cross-section of society right here in 
my own crew and I think I have 
a good idea of what’s going on out 
there on the home worlds. 

I’m telling you this. Jack. These 
poor bastards on this sad little 
planet are not the ones who shot up 
those central galaxy worlds we stew 
about so much. I’ve seen those 



worlds. I’ve walked the streets of 
the dead cities. You know and I 
know that the animals who built 
those cities were not even vaguely 
humanoid. The ruined worlds are 
not the point here. What happened 
to them has nothing to do with this 
situation, and I hope you’ll keep 
reminding people of that. We know 
that those cats there in the thick 
stars were blood thirsty sons of 
bitches doing in a few worlds — and, 
hopefully, themselves — but we’ve 
been having nightmares eversince 
the first X&A ship came back 
and showed us the pictures and the 
message they found burned into the 
skin of one of the planets. We’ve 
been quoting it ever since: Look 
on this, ye who aspire, and quake. 
Build not, for we shall return. 

It’s enough to give you the 
creeps. I’ll admit. Twenty worlds 
killed. Up to 200 billions of beings 
done in. And our quaking isola- 
tionists think that every time we go 
out on a mission we’re going to 
run head-on into the planet killers. 
You know my views on this. 1 
think they did themselves in, be- 
cause where the hell are they going 
to return from? We found nothing 
to indicate that they had developed 
anything half as sophisticated as 
the blink drive and the worlds they 
inhabited were packed together 
around five suns in the same neigh- 
borhood. We’ve had ships all over 
this galaxy and there are just the 
twenty dead planets out there to- 
ward the center behind that big

IF 




beautiful grouping of New York 
type stars. We haven’t covered 
every star system in the galaxy, not 
by a long shot, but a civilization 
that could do what they did would 
be able to detect our ships if they 
came within four hundred light 
years, the way a blinking ship sends 
signals ahead of itself through the 
continuum. So I’m going to be 
damned unhappy if you people 
back there at headquarters let the 
ogre-hunters delay a decision on 
this thing until its too late. 

I SUPPOSE I wouldn’t be sur- 
prised if that happened. God 
knows. I’m not surprised at any- 
thing we do. I wouldn’t even be 
surprised if those planet killers 
came sweeping in from a neighbor- 
hood galaxy breathing fire and 
shooting up worlds. We’d just have 
to fight ‘em. We’re not completely 
without a defense, you know. For 
15,000 N.Y. we’ve been worrying 
about those dead bastards and 
we’ve spent a lot of loot working 
on weapons we’ve jiever had a need 
for. If they could kill a planet, we 
had to be able to kill a planet. You 
know the drift. We bewail their 
cruelty, but we’re not entirely with- 
out aggressive tendencies. Our his- 
tory shows that. So far we’ve not 
killed entire worlds, but we sure 
cut the population when Zede IV 
came up with that fascist nut who 
was going to establish an empire. 
We’ve got some blood on our 
hands, too. We go armed. Hell, 



I’ve got enough armament aboard 
an Expo, ship to handle a fleet of 
those planet killers and shoot up a 
dozen worlds while doing it. I’ve 
never had to use a single popgun 
and I pray I don’t ever have to — 
but I’ve got them and 1 would use 
them if necessary. 1 have an antip- 
athy for planet killers. I’d kill a 
few planets nfiyself to keep them 
from killing any of ours. Ain’t that 
human logic? 

But we’ve been good boys and 
girls for a few thousand N.Y. and 
we haven’t killed anyone except in 
accidents and occasional cases of 
psychopathic murder or some- 
thing. We’ve spread ourselves from 
asshole to appetite all over this 
arm of the galaxy and we’re breed- 
ing as fast as we can to settle more 
worlds. I think I heard someone 
say that new world settlement re- 
quests come into United Planet 
Central at the rate of about five a 
year. We’re pretty prolific. There 
are a hell of a lot of us and we’re 
still suffering from two bugs. One, 
we’re lonely. In our billions, we’re 
all alone. We can’t understand why 
there’s no life in this galaxy except 
us. We’re always looking for it and 
always scared we’re going to find 
it and discover the planet killers. 
This makes us hope and quake at 
the same time, being human, but 
we’re curious enough to go on 
looking. We’re so hungry for com- 
pany we breed our dogs to be al- 
most human and those scientists 
on Xanthos II breed sea mammals

go swimming around under the 
water with them, talking about this 
amazing intelligent life. Well, I 
think a lot of people are thinking of 
Z&A in terms of a search for hu- 
man dogs. 

What if we run into someone out 
here who is our equal? Not the 
planet killers, but just a race that 
can stand up to us intellectually? 
Will we start shooting, unable to 
bear the competition? 

When that creepy little telepath. 
Dr. Feli Janti from Belos II, dis- 
covered that these poor bastards 
we’ve finally run across — these 
Class 1-B Humanoids — are way 
the hell and gone ahead of us in 
certain mental powers he panicked. 
He wanted me to start shooting. 
Some of these people can, without a 
single number, without a bit of 
math, picture in their heads a quan- 
tity of what they call sun circles 
equivalent to 100,000 of our old 
years. 

This Dr. Felo Janti ran face to 
face with a guy who could manipu- 
late his cells at the atomic level. 
Janti got pictures of others who 
fly or teleport, using some power 
we can’t even measure. He went 
white. He shook. He turned to me 
and said, “Captain, I recommend 
that we sterilize the planet immedi- 
ately.’’ He made a snap judgment, 
just like that, from having looked 
into the mind of one of them. His 
voice shook. He was scared right 
out of his bowels. These people 



don’t have a single weapon, offen- 
sive or defensive, and their only 
enemy is the planet itself, but that 
creep wanted to wipe them out lest 
they overpower us with their su- 
perior mental abilities and Tob the 
women and rape the men of 
something. 

Jack, 1 know I’m taking up a lot 
of your time. I know you’re 
damned busy flying that desk and 
painting scuff spots on the red 
tape. So I’ll get down to it. 

W E’VE seen some hell-holes 
together. Jack. Terra II is a 
good example of a dead planet. 
Some of the places we checked out 
were pretty bad, but all of them are 
like paradise compared to this one. 
She’s a hot one. She’s greenhoused 
by a thick atmosphere and under it 
there’s a lot of volcanic activity, 
just as if she’d been split by some- 
thing down to the mantle. The air 
is full of sulphur anfd ammonia and 
other good jazz like that and the 
rest of it is inert with just the barest 
trace of oxygen. The surface is 
about eight-tenths water, because 
the heat under that blanket is up to 
the level where if you tried to take a 
bath in water that hot you’d burn 
your tail off. Right on the poles, in 
the wintertime, there’s just a trace 
of frost. It melts off completely in 
the summer. There’s lots of water, 
but it’s fortunate that these people 
don’t need it, getting theirs from 
their all-purpose liquid food which 
comes from a slimy green sea

plant. The potable water is as 
scarce as it is on any desert planet 
you can name. The rivers are 
chemical sewers and the seas are 
just about as thick as a good Juaro 
soup — only they contain everything 
that is soluble in' water. They’d 
float a piece of steel, almost, 
they’re so saturated. There’s not 
enough soil on the planet to grow a 
patch of beans and the rock is bare, 
exposed down to the solid level 
almost everywhere except in valleys 
where soil has been trapped. Those 
low places are something out of a 
nightmare. They’re filled with 
plants thai look like diseased toad- 
stools, although they’re unlike 
anything we’ve seen because 
they’re as toxic as a Telos red- 
snake and the soil holds about 
all the radioactivity that is left on 
the planet. It limits the stay in a 
Type-A suit to about ten minutes. 
That’s damned hot. The radio- 
activity is artificially produced and 
is all old stuff. Lots of the carbon 
series. There are enough original 
radioactives deep down to tell us 
what happened. There are indica- 
tions of mining at very deep levels. 
Yep. That’s the story. 1 didn’t put 
that in my official report and 1 
leave it to you whether or not to 
break it right now. I’m afraid if 1 
said it I might give the isolationists 
fodder for their fear-mongering. 

The planet has been system- 
atically looted of every resource. 
On the surface there’s not enough 
metal to get together a good child’s 



toy and indications point to quite 
a few millennia since anyone has 
dug for it. We’ve turned up samples 
of most of the common stuff. Lead 
208 and 206 and a bit of U-235 at 
the deep levels. On the surface, 
especially next to the vegetation in 
the low spots, there’s some Stron- 
tium 90 and Cesium 137. It gets 
into the atmosphere at times. 

But these are not the planet 
killers of the central galaxy. I’d 
stake my career on that. Jack. I 
may be doing it anyway right now. 
This planet was killed, all right, but 
not by those bloody bastards of the 
center worlds. This one is older. 
Not in geological formation, but in 
settlement. You know we shifted 
our X&A missions to the periphery 
after we failed to turn up anything 
in our own neighborhood and after 
we found the central worlds in ruins 
and dated them some 75,000 N.Y. 
old. The planet killers were in their 
big, final battles just about the time 
we came from wherever it was we 
came from. So it stood to reason 
that we hadn’t come from the cen- 
tral galaxy or beyond, or we’d have 
encountered the killers on the way 
to old Terra II. 

Here’s a side thing that might 
cause the isolationists to shudder. 
Suppose we’d missed Terra II — 
and it’s a loner, the only life-zone 
planet in its sector. Then we’d have 
gone on in and we’d have run head- 
on into that big war and that would 
have been the end of us. But we 
didn’t. We hit on the one planet in 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER

a thousand that could give us the 
proper conditions and then we 
settled down and started pulling 
ourselves into space again. It took 
us a while and that leads me to 
think that the first ships must have 
been primitive. It makes me think, 
sometimes, that Jordan is right in 
his theory about a one-ship landing. 
That would explain a lot. If pne 
ship had carried our little zoo out 
from the mother planet, wherever 
the hell it is, and if it had been 
severely damaged on landing — 
suffering destruction of the history 
tapes or whatever — we might have 
the answer. Suppose the survivors 
were left with nothing but their 
intelligence. They’d have been so 
damned busy during the first few 
generations — rebuilding toward a 
technological civilization — that 

they wouldn’t have bothered with 
esthetics like history and where 
they came from. Word of mouth 
is a chancy way of preserving fact. 

ALL RIGHT. I’m rambling. But 
it’s all connected. It’s all 
about the damnedest bunch of 
people I’ve ever imagined. This 
world is peopled by four distinct 
racial types. No type is-dominant. 
One type is a moron-intellectual 
sort of being, female, and the most 
humanoid in appearance. These 
moron-intellectual females wouldn’t 
even qualify for a bush league 
Miss Local Belle contest on the 
home worlds, but they’re defi- 
nitely humanoids. They’re hairless, 



but they have skin much like ours, 
only a bit thicker and tougher. They 
have breasts and most of the other 
female toys. They grow to adult- 
hood, a bit smaller than the average 
U.P. female, with their brains 
remaining at the level of about a 
six-month-old baby. I’ve seen one 
or two of them. They lie in bed, 
naked, kicking and mewling like 
infants. But behind that part of the 
brain that controls their bodily 
functions i^ an area which, accord- 
ing to the creep from Belos II, is 
like a flesh-and-blood computer. 
These idiot-computer beings can’t 
control that part of the brain, but 
it’s used by another life form. This 
is a male who lives and works with 
the idiot female and he’s a real-life 
monster. He doesn’t have any eyes. 
He’s got scales like a lizard and a 
chest about the size of a barrel 
and his head comes out of his 
shoulders in a solid, fleshy peak to 
point into a rounded dome. He’s 
got a small mouth and a hairy, 
inverted nose through which he 
breathes. 

Oh, I forgot — all four types have 
one thing in common. They have 
red gills on their necks. The com- 
puter morons look as if the gills 
haven’t been fully formed. The gills 
have something to do with breath- 
ing and the computer morons can’t 
go outside except under ideal con- 
ditions. The male types living with 
the computer morons have the 
gills on the thick, fleshy portion of 
the tall dome of head. They see and

IF 




hear and apparently smell and do a 
lot of things our experts are study- 
ing — do them ' with senses much 
like old-fashioned radar. They can 
hurt with the power of their minds, 
but they’re gentle. .We’ve observed 
no attempt to dominate. They can 
send their senses bouncing off the 
near planets and — try this one on 
for size — they can sense the stars. 
Of course they’re not sending sig- 
nals all the way there and back — 
the nearest star to their sun is 4+ 
light-years distant — but they can 
feel something, maybe the light 
from the stars as it comes down 
through an atmosphere which in 
broad daylight on a summer’s day 
makes it as dark as the inside of a 
cat’s gut. They’ve got a sense of 
time, but no written calendar, of 
course. A sort of abstraction tells 
them the season, the month — 
although they have no names for 
the months, just abstract pictures 
comparing the time with the entire 
year and the day in relationship to 
the entire year. 

The two other types are male and 
female. The female is the flyer. 
She uses electromagnetic force — in 
some way that has our boys bog- 
gling their minds — to lift herself 
and a considerable load for fan- 
tastic distances. More on that later. 
Her male counterpart is the 
worker. He’s developed some 
amazing body functions, including 
the ability to rebuild damaged 
cells at the DNA level. And that 
healing ability allows him to go out 



into that hell of a planet and gather 
food. He likes to travel and bugs 
around over all the land areas and 
under the seas when he^ not work- 
ing. He can exist in an atmosphere 
that wouldn’t give a good breath of 
air to an ant. He stores oxygen and 
nutrition in his cells' and uses his 
reserves at will. 

These last two types are the 
breeders. They breed just once in 
a lifetime — and by that 1 mean 
all that goes with it. Once in a life- 
time, Jack. How would you like 
that? 

All four of the types are ugly. The 
male breeder has huge, thick scales 
that bounce off radiation and the 
hard particles from the sun. That in 
itself is worthy of a lifetime of study 
by a dozen of our scientists. He has 
a chest capacity of about four cubic 
liters. He has eyes, as de the three 
types other than the radar fellow. 
The male breeder also has the 
strongest esthetic sensibilities. 

You’ve got all this if you’ve read 
the rather unusual transcript we 
sent as exhibit number one in this 
affair. I hope you have read it~- 
and thoroughly— because this 
whole thing means a lot to me and, 
I sincerely feel, it means a helluva 
lot to all of us. 

H ERE’S this society working 
together. They never, never, 
except in rare and isolated cases of 
severe law-breaking, do any harm 
to any living thing. They’re the 
dominant form on the planet, but 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



163 




there’s not much else. There’s a 
large, spiderlike thing. Another in- 
sect type is about as large as a 
phralley dog, looks like an ant and 
makes a fantastic amount of sting 
fluid. Then there are the half-plant, 
half-animal creatures, the size of 
the period dot on a blinkstat typer, 
which can eat the atmosphere and 
synthesize oxygen. These little bugs 
are keeping the race more or less 
alive. 

The people know they’re living 
on a dying planet, but they don’t 
know why it’s dying. They have a 
semi-religion and worship nature 
as a force for good. Their god is 
life itself. They think the role of na- 
ture is to people worlds with life of 
an intelligent nature and to them 
that means people like themselves. 
But their faith is being tested, be- 
cause their best minds predict 
death for the race in about one 
generation. We think they have 
plus or minus nine years, N.Y., 
that is, before the air is gone. We 
may be slightly underestimating 
their survival capacity, but it is my 
considered opinion— and the opin- 
ion of my staff— that the situation 
is urgent. They’re going to die. The 
little oxygen makers they call 
Breathers are being killed in their 
natural habitat by a worsening of 
the sea and air conditions. There 
isn’t any new oxygen being made 
to speak of. They keep colonies of 
the Breathers inside their homes, 
but the Breathers are relatively 
short-lived and have to have 



optimum conditions, to breed 
satisfactorily. They decline in 
captivity, the breeding not keeping 
pace with the dying. They have to 
be replenished from the natural 
supply with much labor and 
difficulty — and that supply has to 
be enough for people on two land 
masses. In plus or minus nine years 
there ain’t gonna be no supply of 
new Breathers. 

For the first time in history we’re 
face to face with an intelligent 
alien society and it almost makes 
me believe in their nature worship, 
because we’ve come on this at a 
crucial time and we have the power 
to help them. We can save them by 
moving in equipment to manufac- 
ture oxygen from the water or the 
rocks, as we do on some mining 
planets, but that would cost a 
bloody fortune and would require 
contact. Moreover, it would be an 
endless process, because this world 
is farther gone than any inhabited 
planet I’ve ever seen. 

Basically, that’s the case. Jack. 
We help or they die. I hope you 
haven’t made a decision yet, be- 
cause I’m going to hit you right in 
the balls with a few facts we’ve dug 
up. 

One, our archeologists have 
made test borings and excavations. 
We have to do this in out-of-the- 
way places, because it’s difficult 
as hell for our boy wonders from 
Belos II to sneak up on some of 
these characters, hold them in 
hypnosis and then shoot them with 



164 



IF 




something to keep them in a daze 
so they won’t notice us. Still, while 
keeping security and not making 
contact, we’ve been able to do some 
interesting things. It’s difficult to 
state anything with much authority, 
because by our measurements this 
present society is about as old as 
we are, about 75,000 New Years. 
You can imagine how 75,000 N.Y. 
can raise hell with world subjected 
to corrosive rains and uncontrolled 
erosion — and especially one that 
has been burned good with atomics. 

Yep.. That’s what I said. She was 
burn^ bald. Just like the planet 
killers’ leavings. Only these people 
did it the hard way with old- 
fashioned atomics, not the goodies 
the planet killers had. The signs are 
unmistakable. All the old, decay- 
ing isotopes are present. They must 
have us^ very funny bombs, be- 
cause they produced a lot of carbon 
isotopes with long half-lives. 

1 know that I’m going to be asked 
how, if there was enough stuff 
around 75,000 N.Y. ago to leave 
this much hot stuff, anyone at all 
survived to found this new race. 
Well, 1 haven’t got the answer, 
only proof that they did survive, 
because they are here. 

I ’VE monitored as many inter- 
views as I could. The ones with- 
out eyes and ears and with the 
pointed heads call themselves Far 
Seers. That’s because they can send 
that radar-like sense out to vast 
distances. The Far Seers are the 



priests of the nature thing, explain- 
ing with clear logic that nature 
abhors a vacuum as far as life is 
concerned. The Far Seers believe 
that all the far suns they can sense 
have planets and that those planets 
swarm with life like themselves. 

I’ve looked into the records of the 
Far Seers, kept in the back part of 
the minds of the Keepers, those 
female moron computers. I know 
about as much about the history of 
this race as they themselves know. 

Incidentally, Jack, the Far Seers 
screw the Keepers with astounding 
frequency. They’re very virile cats, 
but completely sterile, like that 
creature out of our mythology, 
the mule. That is their only plea- 
sure, but they’re not just dirty old 
men. The Keepers, also sterile but 
well developed sexually, enjoy it, 
too. 

That’s just an aside, but 1 think 
it shows as much as anything that 
these fellows have basic human 
traits. 

1 was talking about looking into 
the minds of the Keepers. I do it, 
of course, with the help of the. little 
bastard from Belos II, who can’t 
concentrate, but has to keep look- 
ing into my mind to see if I’m 
having too many wet dreams or 
something. It’s interesting to note 
that these people are about as foggy 
about their beginnings as we are 
about ours. They have some in- 
complete legends, just as we do. 
They think they’ve mutated from a 
race they call the Old Ones. They 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



165 




believe that nature adapts life to 
meet the conditions of a world. 
They believe that in times of crisis 
nature comes up with a New One.to 
pull life through. This is like saying 
that environment shapes life, isn't 
it? Here on this world it seems to. 
These people have adapted to con- 
ditions that would kill one of us in 
the time it would take the brain to 
die from lack of oxygen, while poi- 
soning him in about a dozen dif- 
ferent ways in the meantime. 

Their legends tell of nature’s 
forming the First Healer. He could 
live with what they picture as small, 
hard projectiles: radiation. He ap- 
parently did, for the Healer calls on 
that strange ability of his to repair 
radiation-damaged cells and his 
scales bounce off all kinds of radia- 
tion in quantities that would kill a 
horse. His organs don’t collect the 
bad stuff either. They throw it out 
and vent it, along with the waste 
gases and unused toxic content of 
the air, through the gills. So this 
First Healer came along as a mu- 
tation and then bred the Keepers 
and the Far Seers — breeding with 
what they call the Old Ones. I’d 
guess that it was the Old Ones who 
did in the planet with atomics. 

There’s a beautiful line in one of 
their records, a thing in pictures, 
of course, which is called, roughly. 
The Book Of Rose the Healer. 
They don’t know what a rose is, but 
there’s this good picture of a rose 
left in their minds after the condi- 
tions that would have produced a 



rose have been gone for 75,000 
N.Y. Rose the Healer said that the 
Old Ones fornicated even in death, 
producing the Healers. That 
sounds rather human, doesn’t it? 
So they fornicated and out came 
mutations. Instant adaptation. Be- 
lieve it or not. I suspect the legends 
condense the process somewhat. 

But we have to believe what we 
see and what we find. We have here 
a world which, at one time, was 
highly technologized, to the point 
of atomics. We’ve found a few de- 
composing chunks of metal to in- 
dicate that they were working 
with some advanced alloys of an 
atomic culture type. We’ve found a 
sizable city under the sea. There’s 
not much there and we can’t get to 
it because it’s under a few hundred 
feet of sludge, but it’s there. We 
detect decomposed metals, stone, 
everything to indicate that it was a 
real city. It went under. I’d guess, 
about 75,000 N.Y. ago, either from 
the melting of the ice(;aps or from 
the planetary crust distortion in- 
dicated by wide rifts and by the 
fact the crust is split down close to 
the molten core in the south of the 
western hemisphere. I’m using west 
as they use it. 

We’ve found a few traces of plas- 
tics. You’d think we could Find 
more, but 75,000 N.Y. is a good 
chunk of time and a lot of it must 
have been burned with the surface 
stuff. I’m sure that, given time, 
we’II find some underground de- 
posits that will tell us more. But I

IF 




don’t want to be a part of any un- 
dertaker’s group doing an autopsy 
on this world. I know we don’t have 
enough proof from what I’m com- 
ing to, not yet, but 1 say we have to 
take the risk and prove our justifi- 
cation later. 

So this world was much like some 
of ours with atomics, the right 
metals, the suitable plastics. It 
killed itself. The present race muta- 
ted from the original race,, which 
was humanoid, because the forms 
of the things we can identify by 
instrument in the sunken city point 
definitely to a humanoid origin. 
The question is, who were the Old 
Ones? 

I think I have an answer to that. 

Y OU know the prescribed 
approach to a life-zone planet. 
We came in slowly and carefully, 
did a lot of instrument work at long 
range. When we detected no probes 
from the planet we looked for a 
base close in and found it on a 
large, airless satellite. It was per- 
fect. It kept just one face to the 
planet, as do the satellites of some 
of our worlds. We came down on 
the back side and peeked around 
the horizon with instruments. Noth- 
ing doing down there. We went 
th|;ough normal routine. We sent 
crews around planetside to probe 
her and measure her. I had come 
down with a cold and was sacked 
out with a couple of wonderful 
drugs making me groggy. Then one 
of my junior officers who had been 



surfaceside came in with his ass in 
an uproar and what he told me 
made the drug-wooziness leave me 
like a hangover after a dose of 
Zarts. I got into a ^it and took a 
jumper around to where one of my 
crews had just had the hell scared 
out of it — enough to yell for the old 
man. The men were all milling 
around a veritable junkpile. 

Yep. We were not the first ones 
to land on that satellite. Someone 
had been there ahead of us. Two of 
those someones were still there. 

This, too, is not in the report. 
Jack. I know, 1 know. It should 
have been sent immediately Code I, 
but you know and I know that 
there’s nothing that whets the curi- 
osity of an X&A stat clerk Hke a 
Code 1 rating. It would have been 
all over the U.P. But a Personal- 
Personal thing, that’s fairly sacred. 

There was this half-dome of 
semi-opaque material. We could 
see into it. It was about five feet at 
the highest point, about the same 
wide. It had a lock type entry. In- 
side were these two things. They 
had huge chests and they had 
scales. They were lying on a little 
bed with their arms around each 
other. They looked as if they were 
asleep, but we knew they had to be 
dead, because we were nightside on 
the satellite and it was colder than 
hell. There was no air. Our instru- 
ments showed no oxygen inside. 
We thought they might be breath- 
ing the inert gases, but we could 
detect no movement. 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



167 




We found later, that they were a 
male and a female of the breeder 
species. The female had these cute 
little silvery and gold scales. The 
male was as horny as any Phebus 
lizard in any zoo. 

The thing that stoned our people 
was the lack of any propellant de- 
vice. I mean, you could see through 
the whole thing and the plastic- 
like material was soft to the touch. 
There was nothing in it that we 
could detect to push it. 

I sent for a team. The two inside 
were obviously dead. It took a few 
hours to get ready and then I 
opened the lock. It was a funny 
thing, that lock. No apparent rea- 
son for it to stay locked and it 
opened easily, but when it was 
closed the material overlapped it- 
self and formed an airtite seal. 
Well, after we’d taken all the pic- 
tures and measurements our scien- 
tists wanted, I went in. As per 
regulations, I went in with the 
telepath from Belos II, even 
though I knew in my mind that 
there was no chance of contact, 
since they had to be dead. There 
was completely dead air in the 
dome. No oxygen at all. Along the 
walls, in little tanks, were dead 
things like tiny flower buds. I was 
casing the joint when Dr. Janti, 
creepy little fink that he was, came 
on with his communicator full 
blast and almost ruptured my 
eardrums. 

He was yelling, “It’s alive. It’s 
alive.’’ 



ALL the dead air had evacuated 
the open lock. I ordered the 
lock closed and then I told Janti to 
vent his spare oxygen into the air. 
We emptied our tanks and suits of 
all but a reserve. There must have 
been just enough air in that cold 
dome finally to give a mouse a full 
breath, but it was enough for that 
big fellow with the scales. I’ll be 
damned if he didn’t move. I was 
paralyzed. I won’t say I forgot my 
duty, but I ignored regulations, 
because here was the first intelli- 
gent life we had ever encountered. 
I wasn’t about to bug out of there 
and let it die. I watched, my hackles 
rising, as his big, thick, scaled chest 
heaved and then I got some more 
oxygen into the dome. We had it 
filled with good, sweet air. That 
scaled monster sat up. 

“Contact, please. Dr. Janti,’’ I 
ordered. 

The alien was sitting on the little 
bed looking at us from a set of blue 
eyes unlike anything I’d ever seen — 
huge, soft, alive. Think of the eyes 
of one of those Satina sea nymphs 
and multiply them four times. He 
looked at us and the little creep 
from Belos fl went probing into his 
mind. Meantime, this scaled cat 
was breathing us down to nothing. 
His lungs and cells could hold al- 
most all the oxygen we pump^ in. 

I was watching hiip. He looked at 
us. His face wasn’t built for expres- 
sion, being pretty well hidden by 
scales and his nose being inverted. 
He made no hostile move. He just

looked, shifted his eyes to Janti 
and I felt a force in the air.x I 
couldn’t put my finger on it. It was 
just something that came out of 
him. 

Then Janti lost control and 
started screaming that the alien had 
to be killed. 

He looked down at his female. 
She wasn’t moving. She was dead. 
I felt this sense of despair so over- 
whelming that I was sure that the 
planet killers had made it Back and 
done in all our worlds with all my 
friends, family, crew, all the girls 
I’d ever loved, all the sweet grass 
I’d walked on and sat on, all the 
good, blue water, all the sweet air, 
everything. Gone. Gone. I don’t 
have the words to describe the 
total sadness I felt. 1 wanted to 
reach out to him, but Janti was 
screaming and clawing to get out of 
the place. He was yelling that the 
alien had to be killed and that we 
had to blast the planet before it was 
too late. I had never realized that 
Janti was a psychopath. Whose 
mind can heal the mind-healer’s 
mind? But all the time he had been 
one of those damned doomsayers 
and he was sure we’d run into the 
form of life that would do us all in 
unless we acted quickly. 

In all this turmoil — Janti’s letting 
his mind go ape was affecting even 
me — the scaled fellow turned, made 
an animal sound. It came through. 
It was a sound of pure pain. He 
put his arms around the female; 
held her dead body close. He 



rocked and cocked and it was quiet 
in the dome, because the good 
doctor had made his escape, taking 
all the air out with him. 

I pumped it up again. I went out 
and threatened to smash Janti’s 
faceplate and let in space to boil his 
blood. Janti recovered his sanity 
and came back into the dome. He 
couldn’t get any pictures, any com- 
munication. 1 ordered him to con- 
tact, breaking every rule in the 
book. The scaled fellow was closed 
off tightly and Janti couldn’t find a 
chink. He said the scaled fellow’s 
mind was like a solid, closed ball of 
steel. 

So I had to watch as this alien, 
this first intelligent being we’ve met 
in all our history, died. He held the 
female close and rocked back and 
forth. Tears were running down in- 
side my helmet. There was plenty 
of air in the dome, but the alien 
wouldn’t breathe. He seemed to 
will himself todeath. It took a long, 
long time and nothing we could do 
could reach him. We tried contact 
on various levels. But he was 
closed. Janti said his mind was the 
most powerful he had ever ertcoun- 
tered. In the end we tried to pump 
oxygen into his mouth, but he 
merely voided it from his gills. 

H e WAS from the planet, of 
course. And the way he got to 
the satellite makes for some of the 
most incredible stuff I’ve ever run 
into, fiction or otherwise. I’ve told 
you that the female breeders fly. 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



169 




Well, when we went planetside, by 
sheer luck we landed on this fel- 
low’s home continent. It’s a piece of 
desolate real estate if I’ve ever seen 
one and I’ve seen a few. The scene 
wasn’t much better than the 
planet’s moon. 

Janti and his help made hypno- 
contact. We had been warned in 
advance by our encounter with the 
live one on the mo6n and it was a 
good thing. If we had gone in blind 
those Far Seer types would have 
sensed us. But we went in hypno 
and began to dig around. Turns out 
that the fellow we met on the moon 
was a hero and their last hope. 
Everyone knew all about him. 

He had been sent to the moon be- 
cause of their wild belief in nature. 
They just knew that there was a 
happy, sweet-aired world up there 
on their moon. So they sent these 
damned kids, and I .say kids be- 
cause the life span of a male 
breeder is about twenty-two N.Y., 
that of the female breeder even less. 
She, the female breeder, literally 
consumes her life substance in 
flight. 

It was possible for those two kids 
to go to the moon because he had 
come up with something new. It 
wasn’t a machine or anything like 
that. It was a mutation. They went 
to the moon of that planet on the 
power of the mind. Jack. The 
Healer — he was called the New 
One — was a mutant and, able to 
“blend his flesh” with others. It 
was somewhat like a blood trans- 



fusion, only infinitely more com- 
plete, for he could g6 into the body 
of the others and heal them, as he 
healed himself, on the cell level. 
With his fantastic capacity to store 
oxygen and energy he had enough, 
with what food and air they could 
carry in that dome, to send that 
whole crazy space ship, and that’s 
what it was, all the way to the 
.satellite. 

Don’t ask me yet why they didn’t 
freeze. There was no artificial heat 
in the thing. Our boys think he 
could stand direct sunlight and 
diffuse the heat around the dome 
with his scales or something. At any 
rate, he had to be exposed to direct 
sunlight on the satellite — and to the 
freezing cold. Fantastic tolerance 
for extremes in temperature. When 
we found him he came out of his 
coma unharmed, except for a small 
ashlike deposit on his scales. The 
female, on the other hand, had 
died of a variety of things, appar- 
ently, cold, heat, hard radiation, 
lack of oxygen. 

Okay. So these people knew they 
were done for, that the planet was 
going to kill all of them. This kid 
came up with his mutation, which 
enabled him to drive his space ship 
all the way to the satellite, using his 
female’s power. They went there 
expecting to find life and they found 
airless space and heat and cold and 
death. 

His friends all over the western 
continent, and even in the eastern 
areas knew all about the trip. We 



170 



IF 




were interested in our First alien, 
naturally, so we traced him through 
the records in the minds of the 
Keepers and compiled the stat— the 
exhibit one in this whole thing. 

It’s sad, you’re thinking. They’re 
all going to be dead in plus or minus 
nine N.Y. Perhaps you’re also say- 
ing that so far there is no justifica- 
tion for us to step in. I know that 
there are isolationists high up in the 
council of President Borne and 
they’ll agree with Janti that these 
people could threaten us with their 
fantastic mental powers. How 
would we control people who can 
teleport, send a fatal force from 
their minds, live under conditions 
that would kill us in three minutes? 
I know that a lot of powerful 
people are going to cite our regu- 
lations — no contact until a thor- 
ough study has been made. A study 
which, if carried out according to 
regulations, would take twenty 
N.Y. 

J ACK, we can’t let these people 
die. We’ve spent a lot of time, 
energy and resources trying to find 
exactly what we’ve found, a civili- 
zation of intelligent beings. They’re 
different, but not that different. 
They’re gentle. When we pieced 
together the account of Rack the 
Healer from the minds of the Keep- 
ers and the others it came out so 
human that there wasn’t one of us 
who wasn’t touched. I like to think 
that Rack would be pleased with his 
book. It was taken from a lot of 



sources and the end of it is not.yet 
written. We found a part of Rack’s 
book in the mind of his infant child, 
a Keeper. We found more of it in 
the minds of his friends and their 
Keepers. I wanted you to read it 
even before you scanned the official 
reports, because I think it shows 
that these are nice people. Jack. 

They must be saved. Hell, I’m 
selfish. I want on^ of those Far 
Seers in my crew some day. What 
an exploration tool he’d be! And a 
Power Giver to do short range 
scouting. And a Healer to look 
around on hell-hole planets where 
even the best suit is good for limited 
periods. 

I won’t guarantee that if we took 
them into the United Planets they 
wouldn’t be running things in a few 
hundred years, but we could do 
worse. They have gentleness, true 
regard for individual freedom, a 
reverence for life of any sort. 

If they’re smarter than we are, 
then we’ll just have to buckle down 
and learn more. We just can’t let 
them pass out of existence. 

As I see it, we have three choices. 
We can, let them die — and we’ll do 
this if the regulations are followed. 
We can move some or all of them 
under hypnosis to hide our contact 
and risk having them go into some 
kind of shock when they awaken on 
a totally different planet. Or, we 
can contact them, explain the whole 
situation and move them to a nice, 
fresh planet. It wouldn’t even have 
to be a prime planet. Worlds we

look on as being waste worlds 
would be paradise to them. They’d 
live like kings on Terra II, for 
example. 

1 am unalterably opposed to the 
first course of action, I don’t favor 
the second, because we’d be unable 
to movq all of them in time. 

To support my third suggestion, 
immediate and full contact, I have 
one more item. 

I said, earlier, that when I 
jumped around their moon I found 
my crew beside a regular junk pile- 
Then I purposely didn’t mention 
anything but the dome in which the 
two aliens made the trip from their 
world to the satellite. 

The spot where we found Rack 
the Healer and his nicely named 
female was not, obviously, their 
first landing on the moon. They had 
made some prior stops. We found 
Rack’s footprints in the lunar dust. 
That fantastic scaled character 
could walk around in a complete 
vacuum, using his stored oxygen. 
He’d done a lot of exploration and 
all along he must have known that 
it was hopeless. He didn’t have 
enough reserves to make it back 
home. His Breathers had been used 
up, were dying. His girl must have 
been dying. But he didn’t give up 
and he found this junkpile I men- 
tioned. He knew, as he died, that he 
was not the first to make the trip 
from his planet to his moon, be- 
cause his landing, his last one, was 
made alongside a meteorite-pitted, 
antique contraption that could have 



been nothing but the jettisoned 
stage of a combustion rocket. 

Yep, there it was. We found 
others later. But here was the real 
kick in the backside for us and for 
Rack. This thing has been there a 
helluva long time. It’s pitted, but 
it’s still intact and identifiable, 
maybe not to Rack the Healer, but 
to us. And 1 wondered, as I looked 
at it, what he thought. As you know 
from reading his book, he valued 
and wondered about the small 
chunks of metal he found on his 
planet and then, while he was dying, 
knowing that his lover was dead, he 
put his hands — his prints were on 
the dust on the thing — on a store of 
metal he must have not been able to 
believe. A whole junkpile of it. He 
couldn’t have known what it was. 

1 did. And 1 thought of you, old 
buddy, and the talks we used to 
have about where we came from 
and about all our speculations 
— like which direction our ances- 
tors would have taken after they 
launched us into space? We 
dreamed about finding them, being 
welcomed. We would be the long- 
lost children home from the far 
stars. We’d be given the benefit of 
all their advanced wisdom. We’d 
gain immortality, among other 
puny things, because a society 
which, 75,000 N.Y. past, could 
launch a starship, would have made 
unbelievable advances. 

I ’M SORRY I have to kill that 
dream for you, because, know- 



172 



IF 




ing you, I’m sure there’s a spot 
somewhere in your aging carcass 
where that young dream survives. 
But it’s dead, that dream. We killed 
it when we landed on a barren 
satellite without a name, just a 
generic label, moon. It was dead 
when we found Rack and Beautiful 
Wings beside a junkpile of antique 
equipment. I knew it was dead 
when I stood in front of a crazy, 
boasting, thoroughly human thing 
that I’m going to show you in a 
moment. 

But it’s not all bad. Jack. It’s not 
all bad. We’ve been looking for our 
parents for 30,000 N.Y. and now 
we’ve found them. When I looked 
at Rack, the scaled fellow, 1 was 
looking at my cousin a million 
times remov^. Rack and his 
people are mutated from the Old 
Ones and the Old Ones went to the 
moon about 100,000 old years ago. 
Our old year figures to the minute 
or so with their sun circle. So 
100,000 old years ago, the Old Ones 
of Rack’s world went to the moon. 
Then they must have discovered 
better ways to travel, sending our 
immediate ancestors out into space 
with what might have been an un- 
guided version of the blink drive, 
since we landed so far away from 



this insignificent little sun here in 
the periphery. After that they lost 
interest in the barren satellite and 
then they had their little family 
squabble that burned the whole 
world bald. 

Here’s the picture I’ve been 
saving. Jack. As a clue, it’s Old 
English. If yhu have trouble, con- 
sult Parker at the Academy. He’s 
an expert. He’s the one who taught 
me to love the old written language. 
I didn’t have a bit of trouble read- 
ing it, except for the dates, of 
course, which are meaningless. 
Take a look at it. It was placed here 
on this planet’s moon about 100,000 
old years ago, this planet’s years, 
our old years. And I like to think 
that maybe one of my own, a 
grandfather thousands of times re- 
moved, was among the three listed 
as crew on the first moon landing. 
My reason tells me it’s a billion-to- 
one shot, but my intuition tells me 
maybe he was. 

So take a look and think, maybe, 
that one of them was in your-direct 
line, too, and then send me the 
order that will do away with the red 
tape and allow me to save the lives 
of the few survivors of our mother 
race. 

Take a look: 



CAME IN PEACE FOR ALL MANKIND 







THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



173 




READING ROOM 

(At the current price of single vol- 
umes, here is a bargain that makes 
sense — the two fit tightly together.) 

The book is dated in some ways. 
It was written and first published 
during the final days of World War 
II when the concept of “seetee” or 
“c.t.” (contra-terrene) anti-matter 
was new. Williamson wrote it under 
the pseudonym of Will Stewart, 
but he’s now out from behind the 
whiskers. The good guys in this are 
a bit stiff. 

But the problem presented makes 
up for any flaw the book has. See- 
tee matter and normal matter are 
exactly the same, except that see- 
tee has outer positrons and nuclear 
negative particles. Seetee plus nor- 
mal matter react together violently, 
destroying each other completely 
and releasing total energy. 

Bits of seetee are found in the as- 
teroid belt. First problem — detect 
them: no way is known except by 
contact with normal matter. Sec- 
ond problem — make use of the 
power available when you can’t 
possibly handle seetee matter with 
tools of normal matter. 

To add to the complications the 
asteroid miners discover a “plane- 
toid” that is actually an alien ship 
made of seetee matter. It’s loaded 
with all kinds of science and gad- 
gets. But how can it be studied and 
made to work? 



( Continued from page ! 17) 

The combined novels make for a 
lot of good, solid reading. 

Finally we have a book from out- 
side the field that is worth consid- 
ering. Fred Mustard Stewart, so far 
as 1 know, has never been a science- 
fiction writer. But his The Methu- 
seleh Enzyme (Bantam, $1.50) is 
one of those borderline cases that 1 
find more science fiction than not. 
The science is limited, but worked 
out very well. (Stewart shows 
every sign of having been sort of a* 
hobbyist and of having become 
completely fascinated with the sub- 
ject of life extension; he obviously 
researched far more than most 
writers outside the field consider 
necessary.) The story is that of a 
small group of people who are per- 
mitted to take part in the first 
attempt to rejuvenate the aged. 

It turns out there is a price for 
such rejuvenation. Some of this 
price is known to the older charac- 
ters here from the beginning. The 
rest is learned the hard way. It 
makes for a good story. 

A red banner on the cover warns 
you not to reveal the shock ending. 
Phooey. It’s a darned good and 
logical ending and deserves careful 
reading — much of the meaning of 
the book is packed into it. But it’s 
no cheap shocker. It belongs in the 
book and 1 was completely satis- 
fied by it. •
