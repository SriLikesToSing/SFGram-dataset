Be careful before you answer. 
GENIAC the first electrical brain 
construction kit is equipped to play 
tic-tac-toe, cipher and encipher codes, 
convert from binary to decimal, rea- 
son in syllogisms, as well as add, sub- 
tract, multiply and divide. Specific 
problems in a variety of fields — ac- 
tuarial, policy claim settlement, phys- 
ics. etc., can be set up and solved 
with the components. Connections are 
solderless and are completely ex- 
plained with templates in the manual. 
This covers 33 circuits and shows 
how new ones can be designed. 

You will find building and using 
GENIACS a wonderful experience; 
one kit user wrote us: “this kit has 
opened up a new world of thinking 
to me.” You actually see how com- 
puting, problem solving, and game 
play (Tic-tac-toe, nim, etc.) can be 
analyzed with Boolean Algebra and 
the algebraic solutions transformed 
directly into circuit diagrams. You 
create from over 400 specially de- 
signed and manufactured compo- 
nents a machine that solves prob- 
lems faster than you can express 
them. 

Schools and colleges, teachers of 



science or math, engineering, phi- 
losophy or psychology will find tnese 
excellent demonstrators of circuitry, 
solutions in symbolic logic, theory of 
numbers, cybernetics, and automa- 
tion.

POSTSCRIPT 



VER since Frederik Pohl’s 
serial, Slave Ship, appeared 
here, readers have wanted to 
know whether he was imagining 
things in using communication 
with animals as the main theme. 
His explanation, incorporated in 
the book published by Ballantine, 
should clear up the problem: 

“It is not the business of a sci- 
ence fiction writer to record mat- 
ters of contemporary fact or sci- 
entific truths which have already 
been discovered. It is his business 
to take what is already known 
and, by extrapolating from it, 
draw as plausibly detailed a por- 
trait as he can manage of what 
tomorrow’s scientists may learn 
. and of what the human race 
in its day-to-day life may make 
of it all. 

“Since not all of Slave Ship’s 
scientific elements are ‘extrapola- 
tions,’ it seems worthwhile to set 
down a rough guide to which is 
which. To the best of the author’s 
knowledge, no human being since 
Dr. Doolittle has been able to 
conduct a conversation on any 
abstract subject with any creature 
or thing other than another hu- 
man being. However, animal lan- 
guages do exist — not merely 
among the geniuses of the animal 
kingdom, such as primates and 



dogs, but as far down among the 
phyla as one cares to go . Bees 
have been clearly demonstrated 
to communicate with sets of sig- 
nals. If one allows only a ‘spoken’ 
language, we turn to the frog, 
perhaps the lowest animal to 
have a voice at all: A species of 
frog from Santo Domingo owns at 
least one ‘word,’ a sort of pig- 
squeal alarm cry utterly different 
from its normal barking sound. 

“Progressing to higher orders, 
Dr. Konrad V. Lorenz is perfectly 
able to communicate, on such 
matters as would interest them, 
with mallards and with greylag 
geese, among others. His com- 
mand of Jackdaw includes such 
subtleties as the two forms of the 
verb “to fly’— Kia, to fly away; 
Kiaw, to fly back home. Other 
persons, working with other birds, 
have achieved successes of their 
own. Ernest Thompson Seton re- 
corded a long list of ‘words’ in 
Crow; a scientist prepared a seven 
word ‘dictionary’ of Rooster, etc. 

“When we come to the mam- 
mals, we might expect to find con- 
siderable increases both in the 
number of ‘words’ and in the so- 
phistication with which they are 
used ... It is true that domestic 
animals (particularly when they

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Looking For Us, Professor? 

"Hmm, yes. I was just cogitating upon the causes of GALAXY 
Science Fiction's phenomenal growth in popularity." 

"And that needs an explanation, Professor?" 

"From a socio-psychological viewpoint, most definitely. To 
what do you attribute the constant increase of interest?" 

"Well . let's try it this way. Professor. Suppose we ask the 
questions and you answer them." 

"So? A bit unusual, but go right ahead." 

"Do you think atomic doom is the only future for mankind?" 

"Not exactly, but the newspapers and the commentators—" 

"Of course. Well, we SHOW other possible futures. Do you 
believe we will be able to leave the Earth?" 

"Eventually, perhaps. But not in our lifetime." 

"We don't agree. Assuming you're right, though, isn't that all 
the more reason to want to know what we'll find on other 
planets. Professor?" 

"I think I see what you mean." 

"Can we achieve immortality?" 

"Ah. Hum. I've often wondered." 

"And travel to different eras in time?" 

"That would be exciting." 

"And you've been trying to discover why GALAXY is growing 
so popular? Every idea we've mentioned— and a lot more, be- 
sides— is treated dramatically and "ividly in GALAXY! You really 
live them!" 

"Umm. How do I subscribe? After all, one shouldn't resist a

HE machine was a lulu. 
That’s what we called her: 
Lulu. 

And that was our big mistake. 
Not the only one we made, of 
course, but it was the first, and 
maybe if we hadn’t called her 
Lulu, it might have been all right. 



Technically, Lulu was a PER, 
a Planetary Exploration Robot. 
She was a combination spaceship 
/base of operations/synthesizer/ 
analyzer/communicator. And 
other things besides. Too many 
other things besides. That was 
the trouble with her.

LULU 



A spaceship should be a darb, a smasher, a 
pip, a beaut . , . but man all battle stations 
if it ever becomes a sweetheart of a ship! 



By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 



Illustrated by MARTIN 




Actually, there was no reason 
for us to go along with Lulu. As 
a matter of fact, it probably 
would have been a good deal bet- 
ter if we hadn’t. She could have 
done the planet-checking without 
any supervision. But there were 
rules which said a robot of her 



class must be attended by no 
fewer than three humans. And, 
naturally, there was some preju- 
dice against turning loose, all by 
itself, a robot that had taken al- 
most twenty years to build and 
had cost ten billion dollars. 

To give her her due, she was 



LULU 



7 



an all-but-living wonder. She was 
loaded with sensors that dug 
more information out of a planet 
in an hour than a full human 
survey crew could have gotten in 
a month. Not only could she get 
the data, but she correlated it 
and coded it and put in on the 
tape, then messaged the informa- 
tion back to Earth Center without 
a pause for breath. 

Without a pause for breath, of 
course — she was just a dumb ma- 
chine. 

Did I say dumb? 

She wasn’t in any single sense. 
She could even talk to us. She 
could and did. She talked all the 
blessed time. And she listened to 
every word we said. She read 
over our shoulders and kibitzed 
on our poker. There were times 
we’d willingly have killed her, ex- 
cept you can’t kill a robot — that 
is, a self-maintaining one. Any- 
how, she cost ten billion dollars 
and was the only thing that could 
bring us back to Earth. 

Q HE took good care of us. That 
^ no one could deny. She syn- 
thesized our food and cooked it 
and served our meals to us. She 
saw that the temperature and hu- 
midity were just the way they 
should be. She washed and pressed 
our clothes and she doctored us 
if we had need of it, like the time 
Ben got the sniffles and she 



whipped up a bottle of some sort 
of gook that cured him overnight 

There were just the three of us 
— Jimmy Robins, our communi- 
cations man; Ben Parris, a robotic 
trouble-shooter; and myself, an 
interpreter — which, incidentally, 
had nothing to do with lan- 
guages. 

We called her Lulu and we 
never should have done that 
After this, no one is ever going to 
hang a name on any of those 
long-haired robots; they’ll just 
have to get along with numbers. 
When Earth Center hears what 
happened to us, they’ll probably 
make it a capital offense to re- 
peat our mistake. 

But the thing, I think, that 
really lit the candles was that 
Jimmy had poetry in his soul. It 
was pretty awful poetry and 
about the only thing that could 
be said of it was that it sometimes 
rhymed. Not always even that. 
But he worked at it so hard and 
earnestly that neither Ben nor I 
at first had the heart to tell him. 
It would have done no good even 
if we had. There probably would 
have been no way of stopping 
him short of strangulation. 

We should have strangled him. 

And landing on Honeymoon 
didn’t help, of course. 

But that was out of our control. 
It was the third planet on our as- 
signment sheet and it was our job 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to land there — or, rather, it was 
Lulu’s job. We just tagged along. 

The planet wasn’t called Hon- 
eymoon to start with. It just had 
a charting designation. But we 
weren’t there more than a day or 
two before we hung the label on 
it. 

I’m no prude, but I refuse to 
describe Honeymoon. I wouldn’t 
be surprised at all if Earth Center 
by now has placed our report un- 
d;r lock and key. If you are curi- 
ous, though, you might write and 
ask them for the exploratory data 
on ER56-94. It wouldn’t hurt to 
ask. They can’t do more than 
say no. 

Lulu did a bang-up job on 
Honeymoon and I beat out my 
brains running the tapes through 
the playback mechanism after 
Lulu had put them on the trans- 
mitter to be messaged back to 
Earth. As an interpreter, I was 
supposed to make some sense — 
some human sense, I mean — out 
of the goings-on of any planet 
that we checked. And don’t imag- 
ine for a moment that the phrase 
goings-on is just idle terminology 
in the case of Honeymoon. 

The reports are analyzed as 
soon as they reach Earth Center. 
But there are, after all, some ad- 
vantages to arriving at an inde- 
pendent evaluation in the field. 

I’m afraid I wasn’t too much 
help. My evaluation report boiled 



down essentially to the equivalent 
of a surprised gasp and a blush. 

F INALLY we left Honeymoon 
and headed out in space, with 
Lulu homing in on the next planet 
on the sheet. 

Lulu was unusually quiet, 
which should have tipped us off 
that there was something wrong. 
But we were so relieved to have 
her shut up for a while that we 
never questioned it. We just 
leaned back and reveled in it 
Jimmy was laboring on a poem 
that wasn’t coming off too well 
and Ben and I were in the middle 
of a blackjack game when Lulu 
broke her silence. 

“Good evening, boys,” she said, 
and her voice seemed a bit off- 
key, not as brisk and efficient as 
it usually was. I remember think- 
ing that maybe the audio units 
had somehow gotten out of kilter. 

Jimmy was all wrapped up in 
his poem, and Ben was trying to 
decide if he should ask me to hit 
him or stand with what he had, 
and neither of them answered. 

So I said, “Good evening, Lulu. 
How are you today?” 

“Oh, I’m fine,” she said, her 
voice trilling a bit 

“That’s wonderful,” I said, and 
hoped she’d let it go at that. 

“I’ve just decided,” Lulu in- 
formed me, “that I love you.” 
“It’s nice of you to say so,” I 



LULU 



replied, “and I love you, too.” 

“But I mean it,” Lulu insisted. 
“I have it all thought out I’m in 
love with you.” 

“Which one of us?” I asked. 
“Who is the lucky man?” 

Just kidding, you understand, 
but also a little puzzled, for Lulu 
was no jokester. 

“All three of you,” said Lulu. 

I’m afraid I yawned. “Good 
idea. That way, there’ll be no 
jealousy.” 

“Yes,” said Lulu. “I’m in love 
with you and we are eloping.” 

Ben looked up, startled, and I 
asked, “Where are we eloping 
to?” 

“A long way off,” she said. 
“Where we can be alone.” 

“My God!” yelled Ben. “Do 
you really think — ” 

I shook my head. “I don’t think 
so. There is something wrong, 
but — ” 

Ben rose so swiftly to his feet 
that he tipped the table and sent 
the whole deck of cards spinning 
to the floor. 

“I’ll go and see,” he said. 

Jimmy looked up from his tab- 
let. “What’s going on?” 

“You and your poetry!” I de- 
scribed his poetry in a rather bit- 
ter manner. 

“I’m in love with you,” said 
Lulu. “I’ll love you forever. I’ll 
take good care of you and I’ll 
make you see how much I really 

10 



love you and someday you’ll love 
me—” 

“Oh, shut up!” I said. 

B EN came back sweating. 

“We’re way off course and 
the emergencies are locked.” 

“Can we—” 

He shook his head. “If you ask 
me. Lulu jammed them intention- 
ally. In that case, we’re sunk. 
We’ll never get back.” 

“Lulu,” I said sternly. 

“Yes, darling.” 

“Cut out that kind of talk!” 

“I love you,” Lulu said. 

“It was Honeymoon,” said Ben. 
“The damn place put notions in 
her head." 

“Honeymoon,” I told him, “and 
that crummy verse Jimmy’s al- 
ways writing — ” 

“It’s not crummy verse,” Jimmy 
shot back, all burned up. “One 
day, when I am published—” 
“Why couldn’t you write about 
war or hunting or flying in the 
depths of space or something big 
and noble, instead of all that 
mush about how I’ll always love 
you and fly to me, sweetheart, 
and all the other—” 

“Tame down,” Ben advised me. 
“No good crawling up Jimmy’s 
frame. It was mostly Honeymoon, 
I tell you.” 

“Lulu,” I said, “you got to stop 
this nonsense. You know as well 
as anything that a machine can’t 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



love a human. It’s just plain ri- 
diculous.” 

“On Honeymoon,” said Lulu, 
“there were different species 
that — ” 

“Forget Honeymoon. Honey- 
moon’s a freak. You could check 
a billion planets and not find an- 
other like it.” 

“I love you,” Lulu repeated ob- 
stinately, “and we are eloping.” 

“Where’d she get that eloping 
stuff?” asked Ben. 

“It’s the junk they filled her up 
with back on Earth,” I said. 

“It wasn’t junk,” protested Lulu. 
“If I am to do my job, it’s neces- 
sary that I have a wide and var- 
ied insight into humanity.” 

“They read her novels,” Jimmy 
said, “and they told her about 
the facts of life. It’s not Lulu’s 
fault.” 

“When I get back,” said Ben, 
“I’m going to hunt up the jerk 
who picked out those novels and 
jam them down his throat and 
then mop up the place with him .” 

“Look, Lulu,” I said, “it’s all 
right if you love us. We don’t 
mind at all, but don’t you think 
eloping is going too far?” 

“I’m not taking any chances,” 
Lulu answered. “If I went back 
to Earth, you’d get away from 
me.” 

“And if we don’t go back, 
they’ll come out and hunt us 
down.” 



“That’s exactly right,” Lulu 
agreed. “That’s the reason, sweet- 
heart, that we are eloping. We’re 
going out so far that they’ll never 
find us.” 

“I’ll give you one last chance,” 
I said. “You better think it over. 
If you don’t, I’ll message back to 
Earth and—” 

“You can’t message Earth,” she 
said. “The circuits have been dis- 
connected. And, as Ben guessed. 
I’ve jammed all emergencies. 
There’s nothing you can do. Why 
don’t you stop this foolishness 
and return my love?” 

G ETTING down on the floor 
on his hands and knees, Ben 
began to pick up the cards. Jimmy 
tossed his tablet on the desk. 

“This is your big chance,” I told 
him. ‘Why don’t you rise to the 
occasion? Think what an ode you 
could indite about the ageless and 
eternal love between Machine 
and Man.” 

“Go chase yourself,” said 
Jimmy. 

“Now, boys,” Lulu scolded us. 
“I will not have you fighting over 
me.” 

She sounded like she already 
owned us and, in a way, she did. 
There was no way for us to get 
away from her, and if we couldn’t 
talk her out of this eloping busi- 
ness, we were through for sure. 
“There’s just one thing wrong 



LULU 



11 



with all of this,” I said to her. “By 
your standards, we won’t live 
long. In another fifty years or 
less, no matter how well you may 
take care of us, we’ll be dead. Of 
old age, if nothing else. What will 
happen then?” 

“She’ll be a widow,” said Ben. 
“Just a poor old weeping widow 
without chick or child to bring 
her any comfort.” 

“I have thought of that,” Lulu 
replied. “I have thought of every- 
thing. There’s no reason you 
should die.” 

“But there’s no way — ” 

“With a love as great as mine, 
there’s nothing that’s impossible. 
I won’t let you die. I love you too 
much ever to let you die.” 

We gave up after a while and 
went to bed and Lulu turned off 
the lights and sang us a lullaby. 

With her squalling this lullaby, 
there was no chance of sleeping 
and we all yelled at her to dry up 
and let us get to sleep. But she 
paid no attention to us until Ben 
threw one of his shoes at the 
audio. 

Even so, I didn’t go to sleep 
right away, but lay there think- 
ing. 

I could see that we had to 
make some plans and we had to 
make them without her knowing 
it. That was going to be tough, 
because she watched us all the 
time. She kibitzed and she lis- 

12 



tened and she read over our 
shoulders and there wasn’t any- 
thing we did or said that she 
didn’t know about. 

I knew that it might take quite 
a while and that we must not 
panic and that we must have pa- 
tience and that, more than likely, 
we’d be just plain lucky if we got 
out of it at all. 

After we had slept, we sat 
around, not saying much, listen- 
ing to Lulu telling us how happy 
we would be and how we’d be a 
complete world and a whole life 
in ourselves and how love can- 
celed out everything else and 
made it small and petty. 

Half of the words she used 
were from Jimmy’s sappy verse 
and the rest of it was from the 
slushy novels that someone back 
on Earth had read her. 

I would have got up right then 
and there and beat Jimmy to a 
pulp, only I told myself that what 
was done was done and it wouldn’t 
help us any to take it out on him. 

J IMMY sat hunched over in 
one corner, scribbling on his 
tablet, and I wondered how he 
had the guts to keep on writing 
after what had happened. 

He kept writing and ripping off 
sheets and throwing them on the 
floor, making disgusted sounds 
every now and then. 

One sheet he tossed away 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



landed in my lap, and when I 
went to brush it off, I caught the 
words on it: 

I'm an untidy cuss, 
rm always in a muss, 

And no one ever loves me 
Because I’m a sloppy Gus. 

I picked it up quick and crum- 
pled it and tossed it at Ben and 
he batted it away. I tossed it back 
at him and he batted it away 
again. 

“What the hell you trying to 
do?” he snapped. 

I hit him in the face with it 
and he was just starting to get up 
to paste me when he must have 
seen by my look that this wasn’t 
just horseplay. So he picked up 
the wad of paper and began fool- 
ing with it until he got it un- 
wrapped enough to see what was 
written on it. Then he crumpled 
it again. 

T ULU heard every word, so we 
couldn’t talk it over. And 
we must not be too obvious, be- 
cause then she might suspect. 

We went at it gradually, per- 
haps more gradually than there 
was any need, but we had to be 
casual about it and we had to be 
convincing. 

We were convincing. Maybe 
we were just natural-born slobs, 
but before a week had ended, our 



living quarters were a boar’s 
nest. 

We strewed our clothes around. 
We didn’t even bother to put 
them in the laundry chute so 
Lulu could wash them for us. We 
left the dishes stacked on the 
table instead of putting them in 
the washer. We knocked out our 
pipes upon the floor. We failed to 
shave and we didn’t brush our 
teeth and we skipped our baths. 

Lulu was fit to be tied. Her or- 
derly robot intellect was out- 
raged. She pleaded with us and 
she nagged at us and there were 
times she lectured us, but we kept 
on strewing things around. We 
told her if she loved us, she’d 
have to put up with our messi- 
ness and take us as we are. 

After a couple of weeks of it, 
we won, but not the way we had 
intended. 

Lulu told us, in a hurt and re- 
signed voice, she’d go along with 
us if it pleased us to live like pigs. 
Her love, she said, was too big a 
thing to let a small matter like 
mere personal untidiness inter- 
fere with it. 

So it was no good. 

I, for one, was rather glad of it 
Years of spaceship routine re- 
volted against this kind of life 
and I don’t know how much more 
of it I could have stood. 

It was a lousy idea to start 
with. 



LULU 



13 



E CLEARED up and we got 
ourselves clean and it was 
possible once again to pass down- 
wind of one another. 

Lulu was pleased and happy 
and she told us so and cooed over 
us and it was worse than all the 
nagging she had done. She 
thought we’d been touched by her 
willing sacrifice and that we were 
making it up to her and she 
sounded like a high school girl 
who had been invited by her hero 
to the Junior Prom. 

Ben tried some plain talk with 
her and he told her some facts of 
life (which she already knew, of 
course) and tried to impress upon 
her the part that the physical fac- 
tor played in love. 

Lulu was insulted, but not 
enough to bust off the romance 
and get back to business. 

She told us, in a sorrowful voice 
tinged by the slightest anger, that 
we had missed the deeper mean- 
ing of love. She went on to quote 
some of Jimmy’s more gooey 
verse about the nobility and the 
purity of love, and there was 
nothing we could do about it. We 
were just plain licked. 

So we sat around and thought 
and we couldn’t talk about it be- 
cause Lulu would hear everything 
we said. 

We didn’t do anything for sev- 
eral days but just mope around. 

As far as I could see, there was 

14 



nothing we could do. I ran 
through my mind all the things a 
man might do to get a woman 
sore at him. 

Most women would get burned 
up at gambling. But the only rea- 
son they got sore at that was be- 
cause it was a threat to their se- 
curity. Here that threat could not 
possibly exist. Lulu was entirely 
self-sufficient. We were no bread- 
winners. 

Most women would get sore 
at excessive drinking. Security 
again. And, besides, we had not a 
thing to drink. 

Some women raised hell if a 
man stayed away from home. We 
had no place to go. 

All women would resent an- 
other woman. And here there 
were no women — no matter what 
Lulu thought she was. 

There was no way, it seemed, 
to get Lulu sore at us. 

And arguing with her simply 
did no good. 

I lay in bed and ran through 
all the possibilities, going over 
them again and again, trying to 
find a chink of hope in one of 
them. By reciting and recounting 
them, I might suddenly happen 
on one that I’d never thought of, 
and that might be the one that 
would do the job. 

And even as I turned these 
things over in my head, I knew 
there was something wrong with 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the way I had been thinking. I 
knew there was some illogic in 
the way I was tackling the prob- 
lem— that somehow I was going 
at it tail-end to. 

I lay there and thought about 
it and I mauled it considerably 
and, all at once, I had it 

T WAS approaching the problem 
as if Lulu were a woman, and 
when you thought about it, that 
didn’t make much sense. For Lulu 
was no ‘woman, but just a robot. 

The problem was: How do you 
make a robot sore? 

The untidiness business had 
upset her, but it had just out- 
raged her sense of rightness; it 
was something she could overlook 
and live with. The trouble with 
it was that it wasn’t basic. 

And what would be basic with 
a robot — with any machine, for 
that matter? 

What would a machine value? 
What would it idealize? 

Order? 

No, we’d tried that one and it 
hadn’t worked. 

Sanity? 

Of course. 

What else? 

Productiveness? Usefulness? 

I tossed insanity around a bit, 
but it was too hard to figure out 
How in the name of common 
sense would a man go about pre- 
tending that he was insane — espe- 



cially in a limited space inside an 
all-knowing intelligent machine? 

But just the same, I lay there 
and dreamed up all kinds of in- 
sanities. If carried out, they might 
have fooled people, but not a 
robot 

With a robot, you had to get 
down to basics and what, I won- 
dered, was the fundamental of in- 
sanity? Perhaps the true horror 
of insanity, I told myself, would 
become apparent to a robot only 
when it interfered with usefulness. 

And that was it! 

I turned it around and around 
and looked at it from every angle. 

It was airtight 

Even to start with, we hadn’t 
been much use. We’d just come 
along because Earth Center had 
rules about sending Lulu out 
alone. But we represented a cer- 
tain potential usefulness. 

We did things. We read books 
and wrote terrible poetry and 
played cards and argued. There 
wasn’t much of the time we just 
sat around. That’s a trick you 
learn in space — keep busy doing 
something, no matter what it is, 
no matter how piddling or pur- 
poseless. 

In the morning, after breakfast, 
when Ben wanted to play cards, 
I said no, I didn’t want to play. I 
sat down on the floor with my 
back against the wall; I didn’t 
even bother to sit in a chair. I 



LULU 



15 



didn’t smoke, for smoking was do- 
ing something and I was deter- 
mined to be as utterly inactive as 
a living man could manage. I 
didn’t intend to do a blessed thing 
except eat and sleep and sit. 

T> EN prowled around some and 
tried to get Jimmy to play a 
hand or two, but Jimmy wasn’t 
much for cards and, anyhow, he 
was busy with a poem. 

So Ben came over and sat on 
the floor beside me. 

“Want a smoke?” he asked, of- 
fering me his tobacco pouch. 

I shook my head. 

“What’s the matter? You 
haven’t had your after-breakfast 
smoke.” 

“What’s the use?” I said. 

He tried to talk to me and I 
wouldn’t talk, so he got up and 
paced around some more and 
finally came back and sat down 
beside me again. 

“What’s the trouble with you 
two?” Lulu troubledly wanted to 
know. “Why aren’t you doing 
something?” 

“Don’t feel like doing any- 
thing,” I told her. “Too much 
bother to be doing something all 
the time.” 

She berated us a bit and I 
didn’t dare look at Ben, but I 
felt sure that he began to see 
what I was up to. 

After a while, Lulu left us 

16 



alone and the two of us just sat 
there, lazier than hill-billies on a 
Sunday afternoon. 

Jimmy kept on with his poem. 
There was nothing we could do 
about him. But Lulu called his 
attention to us when we dragged 
ourselves to lunch. She was just 
a little sharper than she had been 
earlier and she called us lazy, 
which we surely were, and won- 
dered about our health and made 
us step into the diagnosis booth, 
which reported we were fine, and 
that got her more burned up than 
ever. 

She gave us a masterly chew- 
ing out and listed all the things 
there were for us to occupy our 
time. So when lunch was over, 
Ben and I went back and sat 
down on the floor and leaned 
against the wall. This time, Jim- 
my joined us. 

Try sitting still for days on 
end, doing absolutely nothing. At 
first it’s uncomfortable, then it’s 
torture, and finally it gets to be 
almost intolerable. 

I don’t know what the others 
did, but I made up complex ma- 
thematical problems and tried to 
solve them. I started mental chess 
game after chess game, but was 
never able to hold one in my 
mind beyond a dozen moves. I 
went clean back to childhood and 
tried to recreate, in sequence, 
everything I had ever done or ex- 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



perienced. I delved into strange 
areas of the imagination and hung 
onto them desperately to string 
them out and kill all the time I 
could. 

I even composed some poetry 
and, if I do say so myself, it was 
better than that junk of Jimmy’s. 

T THINK Lulu must have 
guessed what we were doing, 
must have known that our atti- 
tude was deliberate, but for once 
her cold robotic judgment was 
outweighed by her sense of out- 
rage that there could exist such 
useless hulks as us. 

She pleaded with us, she ca- 
joled us, she lectured us — for al- 
most five days hand-running, she 
never shut her yap. She tried to 
shame us. She told us how worth- 
less and lowdown and no-account 
we were and she used adjectives 
that I didn’t think she knew. 

She gave us pep talks. 

She told us of her love in prose 
poems that made Jimmy’s sound 
almost restrained. 

She appealed to our manhood 
and the honor of humanity. 

She threatened to heave us out 
in space. 

We just sat there. 

We didn’t do a thing. 

Mostly we didn’t even answer. 
We didn’t try to defend ourselves. 
At times we agreed with all she 
said of us and that, I believe, was 



most infuriating of all to her. 

She got cold and distant Not 
sore. Not angry. Just icy. 

Finally she quit talking. 

We sat, sweating it out. 

Now came the hard part We 
couldn’t talk, so we couldn’t try 
to figure out together what was 
going on. 

We had to keep on doing noth- 
ing. Had to, for it would have 
spoiled whatever advantage we 
might have. 

The days dragged on and noth- 
ing happened. Lulu didn’t speak 
to us. She fed us, she washed the 
dishes, she laundered, she made 
up the bunks. She took care of us 
as she always had, but she did it 
without a word. 

She sure was fuming. 

A dozen crazy thoughts crossed 
my mind and I worried them to 
tatters. 

Maybe Lulu was a woman. 
Maybe a woman’s brain was 
somehow welded into that great 
hunk of intelligent machinery. 
After all, none of us knew the 
full details of Lulu’s structure. 

The brain of an old maid, it 
would have to be, so often disil- 
lusioned, so lonely and so by- 
passed in life that she would wel- 
come a chance to go adventuring 
even if it meant sacrificing a body 
which, probably, had meant less 
and less to her as the years went 
by. 



LULU 



17 



I built up quite a picture of my 
hypothetical old maid, complete 
with cat and canary, and even the 
boarding house in which she 
lived. 

I sensed her lonely twilight 
walks and her aimless chattering 
and her small imaginary triumphs 
and the hungers that kept build- 
ing up inside her. 

And I felt sorry for her. 

Fantastic? Of course. But it 
helped to pass the time. 

T>UT there was another notion 
that really took solid hold of 
me — that Lulu, beaten, had finally 
given up and was taking us back 
to Earth, but that, womanlike, she 
refused to give us the satisfaction 
and comfort of knowing that we 
had won and were going home at 
last. 

I told myself over and over 
that it was impossible, that after 
the kind of shennanigans she’d 
pulled, Lulu wouldn’t dare go 
back. They’d break her up for 
scrap. 

But the idea persisted and I 
couldn’t shake it off. I knew I 
must be wrong, but I couldn’t 
convince myself I was and I be- 
gan to watch the chronometer. I’d 
say to myself, “One hour nearer 
home, another hour and yet an- 
other and we are that much 
closer.” 

And no matter what I told my- 



self, no matter how I argued, I 
became positive that we were 
heading Earthward. 

So I was not surprised when 
Lulu finally landed. I was just 
grateful and relieved. 

We looked at one another and 
I saw the hope and question in 
the others’ eyes. Naturally, none 
of us could ask. One word might 
have ruined our victory. All we 
could do was stand there silently 
and wait for the answer. 

The port began to open and I 
got the whiff of Earth and I didn’t 
fool around waiting any more. 
There wasn’t room enough as yet 
to get out standing up, so I took 
a run at it and dived and went 
through slick and clean. I hit the 
ground and got a lot of breath 
knocked out of me, but I scram- 
bled to my feet and lit out of 
there as fast as I could go. I 
wasn’t taking any chances. I 
didn’t want to be within reach if 
Lulu changed her mind. 

Once I stumbled and almost 
fell, and Ben and Jimmy went 
past me with a whoosh, and I told 
myself that I’d not been mis- 
taken. They’d caught the Earth 
smell, too. 

It was night, but there was a 
big, bright moon and it was al- 
most as light as day. There was 
an ocean to the left of us, with 
a wide strip of sandy beach, and, 
to the right, the land swept up 



it 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



into barren rolling hills, and right 
ahead of us was a strip of woods 
that looked as if it might border 
some river flowing down into the 
sea. 

We legged it for the woods, for 
we knew that if we got in among 
the trees, Lulu would have a 
tough time ferreting us out. But 
when I sneaked a quick look back 
over my shoulder, she was just 
squatting where she’d landed, 
with the moonlight shining on 
her. 

We reached the woods and 
threw ourselves on the ground 
and lay panting. It had been quite 
a stretch of ground to cover and 
we had covered it fast; after 
weeks of just sitting, a man is in 
no condition to do a lot of run- 
ning. 

I had fallen face down and just 
sprawled there, sucking in great 
gulps of air and smelling the good 
Earth smell — old leaf mold and 
growing things and the tang of 
salt from the soft and gentle 
ocean breeze. 

A FTER a while, I rolled over 
on my back and looked up. 
The trees were wrong — there 
were no trees like those on Earth 
— and when I crawled out to the 
edge of the woods and looked at 
the sky, the stars were all wrong, 
too. 

My mind was slow in accepting 



what I saw. I had been so sure 
that we were on Earth that my 
brain rebelled against thinking 
otherwise. 

But finally it hit me, the chill- 
ing terrible knowledge. 

I went back to the other two. 

“Gents,” I said, “I have news 
for you. This planet isn’t Earth at 
all” 

“It smells like Earth,” said Ben. 
“It has the look of Earth.” 

“It feels like Earth,” Jimmy 
argued. “The gravity and the air 
and — ” 

“Look at the stars. Take a gan- 
der at those trees.” 

They took a long time looking. 
Like me, they must have gotten 
the idea that Lulu had zeroed in 
for home. Or maybe it was only 
what they wanted to believe. It 
took a while to knock the wishful 
thinking out of them, as well as 
myself. 

Ben let his breath out slowly. 
“You’re right.” 

“What do we do now?” asked 
Jimmy. 

We stood there, thinking about 
what we should do now. 

Actually it was no decision, but 
pure and simple reflex, condi- 
tioned by a million years of living 
on Earth as opposed to only a few 
hundred in which to get used to 
the idea that there were different 
worlds. 

We started running, as if an or- 



LULU 



19 



der had been given, as fast as we 
could go. 

“Lulu!” we yelled. “Lulu, wait 
for us!” 

But Lulu didn’t wait. She shot 
straight up for a thousand feet or 
so and hung there. We skidded 
to a halt and gaped up at her, not 
quite believing what we saw. Lulu 
started to fall back, shot up again, 
came to a halt and hovered. She 
seemed to shiver, then sank 
slowly back until she rested on 
the ground. 

We continued running and she 
shot up and fell back, then shot 
up once more, then fell back 
again and hit the ground and 
hopped. She looked for all the 
world like a demented yo-yo. She 
was acting strangely, as if she 
wanted to get out of there, only 
there was something that wouldn’t 
let her go, as if she were tethered 
to the ground by some invisible 
elastic cable. 

Finally she came to rest about 
a hundred yards from where she’d 
first set down. No sound came 
from her, but I got the impression 
she was panting like a winded 
hound-dog. 

There was a pile of stuff stacked 
where Lulu had first landed, but 
we raced right past it and ran up 
to her. We pounded on her metal 
sides. 

“Open up!” we shouted. “We 
want to get back in!” 

20 



L ULU hopped. She hopped 
about a hundred feet into the 
air, then plopped back with a 
thud, not more than thirty feet 
away. 

We backed away from her. She 
could have just as easily come 
straight down on top of us. 

We stood watching her, but she 
didn’t move. 

“Lulu!” I yelled at her. 

She didn’t answer. 

“She’s gone crazy,” Jimmy said. 
“Someday,” said Ben, “this was 
bound to happen. It was a cinch 
they’d sooner or later build a 
robot too big for its britches.” 

We backed away from her 
slowly, watching all the time. We 
weren’t afraid of her exactly, but 
we didn’t trust her either. 

We backed all the way to the 
mound of stuff that Lulu had un- 
loaded and stacked up and we 
saw that it was a pyramid of sup- 
plies, all neatly boxed and la- 
beled. And beside the pyramid 
was planted a stenciled sign that 
read: 

NOW, DAMN 
YOU, WORK!! 

Ben said, “She certainly took 
our worthlessness to heart.” 

Jimmy was close to gibbering. 
“She was actually going to ma- 
roon us!” 

Ben reached out and grabbed 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



his shoulder and shook him a lit- 
tle— a kindly sort of shake. 

“Unless we can get back in- 
side,” I said, “and get her operat- 
ing, we are as marooned as if she 
had up and left us.” 

“But what made her do it?” 
Jimmy wailed. “Robots aren’t 
supposed to—” 

“I know,” said Ben. “They’re 
not supposed to harm a human. 
But Lulu wasn’t harming us. She 
didn’t throw us out We ran away 
from her.” 

“That’s splitting legal hairs,” I 
objected. 

“Lulu’s just the kind of gadget 
for hair-splitting,” Ben said. 
“Trouble is they made her damn 
near human. They probably 
poured her full of a lot of law as 
well as literature and physics and 
all the rest of it.” 

“Then why didn’t she just 
leave? If she could whitewash 
her conscience, why is she still 
here?” 

Ben shook his head. “I don’t 
know.” 

“She looked like she tried to 
leave and couldn’t, as though 
there was something holding her 
back.” 

“This is just an idea,” said Ben. 
“Maybe she could have left if we 
had stayed out of sight. But when 
we showed up, the order that a 
robot must not harm a human 
may have become operative 



again. A sort of out of sight, out 
of mind proposition.” 

She was still squatting where 
she’d landed. She hadn't tried to 
move again. Looking at her, I 
thought maybe Ben was right If 
so, it had been a lucky thing that 
we’d headed back exactly when 
we did. 

W/”E STARTED going through 
’’ the supplies Lulu had left 
for us. She had done right well by 
us. Not only had she forgotten 
nothing we needed, but had sten- 
ciled careful instructions and 
even some advice on many of the 
boxes. 

Near the signboard, lying by 
themselves, were two boxes. One 
was labeled tools and the top 
was loosely nailed so we could 
pry it off. The other was labeled 
weapons and had a further sten- 
cil: Open immediately and al- 
ways keep at hand. 

We opened both the boxes. In 
the weapons box, we found the 
newest type of planet-busters — 
a sort of shotgun deal, a general- 
purpose weapon that put out 
everything from bullets to a wide 
range of vibratory charges. In be- 
tween these two extremes were a 
flame-thrower, acid, gas, poisoned 
darts, explosive warheads and 
knockout pellets. You merely 
twirled a dial to choose your am- 
munition. The guns were heavy 



LULU 



21 



and awkward to handle and they 
were brutes to operate, but they 
were just the ticket for a planet 
where you never knew what you 
might run into next 

We turned our attention to the 
rest of the stuff and started to get 
it sorted out There were boxes of 
protein and carbohydrate foods. 
There were cartons of vitamins 
and minerals. There was clothing 
and a tent, lanterns and dishes — 
all the stuff you’d need on a high- 
priced camping trip. 

Lulu hadn’t forgotten a single 
item. 

“She had it all planned out” 
said Jimmy bitterly. “She spent 
a long time making this stuff. She 
had to synthesize every bit of it. 
All she needed then was to find a 
planet where a man could live. 
And that took some doing.” 

“It was tougher than you 
think,” I added. “Not only a 
planet where a man could live, 
but one that smelled like Earth 
and looked and felt like Earth. 
Because, you see, we had to be 
encouraged to run away from her. 
If we hadn’t, she couldn’t have 
marooned us. She had the prob- 
lem of her conscience and — ” 

Ben spat viciously. “Marooned!” 
he said. “Marooned by a love-sick 
robot!” 

“Maybe not entirely robot.” I 
told them about the old maid I 
had conjured up and they hooted 



at me and that made us all feel 
better. 

But Ben admitted that my idea 
needn’t be entirely crazy. “She 
was twenty years in building and 
a lot of funny stuff must have 
gone into her.” 

Dawn was breaking and now, 
for the first time, we really saw 
the land. It was a pleasant place, 
as pleasant as any man might 
wish. But we failed to appreciate 
it much. 

The sea was so blue that it 
made you think of a blue-eyed 
girl and the beach ran white and 
straight and, from the beach, the 
land ran back into rolling hills 
with the faint whiteness of dis- 
tant mountains frosting the hori- 
zon. And to the west was the 
forest. 

J IMMY and I went down to the 
beach to collect some drift- 
wood for a fire while Ben made 
ready to get breakfast. 

We had our arms full of wood 
and were starting back when 
something came charging over 
the hill and down upon the camp. 
It was about rhinoceros size and 
shaped somewhat like a beetle 
and it shone dully in the morning 
light. It made no sound, but it 
was traveling fast and it looked 
like something hard to stop. 

And, of course, we’d left our 
guns behind. 



72 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I dropped my wood and yelled 
at Ben and started running up 
the slope. Ben had already seen 
the charging monster and had 
grabbed a rifle. The beast swerved 
straight for him and he brought 
up his gun. There was a flash of 
fire and then the bright gout of 
an exploding warhead and, for an 
instant, the scene was fogged with 
smoke and shrieking bits of metal 
and flying dust 

It was exactly as if one had 
been watching a film and the film 
had jumped. One moment there 
was the blaze of fire; then the 
thing had plunged past Ben and 
was coming down the slope of the 
beach, heading for Jimmy and 
myself. 

“Scatter!” I yelled at Jimmy 
and didn’t think till later how 
silly it must have sounded to yell 
for just the two of us to scatter. 

But it wasn’t any time or place 
for fine points of semantics and, 
anyhow, Jimmy caught on to 
what I meant He went one way 
down the beach and I went the 
other and the monster wheeled 
around, hesitating for a moment, 
apparently to decide which one of 
us to take. 

And, as you might have known, 
he took after me. 

I figured I was a goner. That 
beach was just plain naked, with 
not a place to hide, and I knew 
I had no chance at all of out- 



running my pursuer. I might be 
able to dodge a time or two, but 
even so, that thing was pretty 
shifty on the turns and I knew in 
the end I’d lose. 

Out of the tail of my eye, I saw 
Ben running and sliding down the 
slope to cut off the beast He 
yelled something at me, but I 
didn’t catch the words. 

Then the air shook with the 
blast of another exploding war- 
head and I sneaked a quick look 
back. 

Ben was legging it up the slope 
and the thing was chasing him, so 
I spun around and sprinted for 
the camp. Jimmy, I saw, was al- 
most there and I put on some 
extra speed. If we only could get 
three guns going, I felt sure we 
could make it 

Ben was running straight to- 
ward Lulu, apparently figuring 
that he could race around her 
bulk and elude the beast. I saw 
that his dash would be a nip-and- 
tuck affair. 

Jimmy had reached the camp 
and grabbed a gun. He had it fir- 
ing before he got it to his shoul- 
der and little splashes of liquid 
were flying all over the running 
beast 

¥ TRIED to yell at Jimmy, but 
had no breath to do it — the 
damn fool was firing knockout 
pellets and they were hitting that 



LULU

i 



tough hide and bursting without 
penetrating. 

Within arm’s reach of Lulu, 
Ben stumbled. The gun flew from 
his hand. His body struck the 
ground doubled up and he rolled, 
trying to get under the curve of 
Lulu’s side. The rhinoceros-thing 
lunged forward viciously. 

Then it happened — quicker 
than the eye could follow, much 
quicker than it can be told. 

Lulu grew an arm, a long, rope- 
like tentacle that snaked out of 
the top of her. It lashed down- 
ward and had the beast about the 
middle and was lifting him. 

I stopped dead still and 
watched. The instant of the lifting 
of the beast seemed to stretch out 
into long minutes as my mind 
scrambled at top speed to see 
what kind of thing it was. The 
first thing I saw was that it had 
wheels instead of feet. 

The dull luster of the hide 
could be nothing but metal and I 
could see the dents where the 
warheads had exploded. Drops of 
liquid spotted the hide — what 
was left of the knockout drops 
Jimmy had been firing. 

Lulu raised the monster high 
above the ground and began 
swinging it around and around. It 
went so fast, it was just a blur. 
Then she let go and it sailed out 
above the sea. It went tumbling 
end over end in an awkward arc 



and plunged into the water. When 
it hit, it raised a pretty geyser. 

Ben picked himself up and got 
his gun. Jimmy came over and I 
walked up to Lulu. The three of 
us stood and looked out to sea, 
watching the spot where the crea- 
ture had kerplunked. 




24 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 







Finally Ben turned around and 
rapped on Lulu’s side with his 
rifle barrel. 

“Thanks a heap,” he said. 

Lulu grew another tentacle, 
shorter this time, and there was 
a face on it It had a lenslike eye 
and an audio and speaker. 



“Go chase yourselves,” Lulu re- 
marked. 

“What’s eating you?” I asked. 

“Men!” she spat, and pulled her 
face in again. 

We rapped on her three or four 
times more, but there was no 
reply. Lulu was sulking. 




25 



LULU 



So Jimmy and I started down 
to pick up the wood that we had 
dropped. We had just gotten it 
picked up when Ben let out a yelp 
from up by the camp and we 
spun around. There was our rhi- 
noceros friend wheeling out of 
the water. 

We dropped the wood and lit 
out for camp, but there was no 
need to hurry. Our boy wasn’t 
having any more just then. He 
made a wide circle to the east of 
us and raced back into the hills. 

We cooked breakfast and ate it 
and kept our guns handy, because 
where there was one critter, there 
were liable to be more. We didn’t 
see the sense in taking chances. 

W E TALKED about our visi- 
tor and since we had to call 
it something, we named it Elmer. 
For no particular reason, that 
seemed appropriate. 

“Did you see those wheels?” 
asked Ben, and the two of us 
agreed that we’d seen them. Ben 
seemed to be relieved. “I thought 
I was seeing things,” he explained. 

But there could be no doubt 
about the wheels. All of us had 
noticed them and there were the 
tracks to prove it — wheel tracks 
, running plain and clear along the 
sandy beach. 

But we were somewhat puzzled 
when it came to determining just 
what Elmer was. The wheels

spelled out machine, but there 
were a lot of other things that 
didn’t — mannerisms that were dis- 
tinctly lifelike, such as the mo- 
mentary hesitation before it de- 
cided which one of us to charge, 
Jimmy or myself, or the vicious 
lunge at Ben when he lay upon 
the ground, or the caution it had 
shown in circling us when it came 
out of the sea. 

But there were, as well, the 
wheels and the unmistakably 
metal hide and the dents made 
by exploding warheads that would 
have torn the biggest and tough- 
est animal to shreds. 

“A bit of both?” suggested Ben. 
“Basically machine, but with 
some life in it, too, like the old- 
maid brain you dreamed up for 
Lulu?” 

Sure, it could be that. It could 
be almost anything. 

“Silicate life?” offered Jimmy. 

“That’s not silicate,” Ben de- 
clared. “That’s metal. Silicate, any 
form of it, would have turned to 
dust under a direct rocket hit. Be- 
sides, we know what silicate life 
is like. One species of it was found 
years ago out on Thelma V.” 

“It isn’t basically life,” I said. 
“Life wouldn’t evolve wheels. 
Wheels are bum inventions so far 
as locomotion is concerned, ex- 
cept where you have special con- 
ditions. Life might be involved, 
but only as Ben says — as a de- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



liberate, engineered combining of 
machine and life.” 

“And that means intelligence,” 
said Ben. 

We sat there around the fire, 
shaken at the thought of it. In 
many years of searching, only a 
handful of intelligent races had 
been found and the level of intel- 
ligence, in general, was not too 
impressive. Certainly nothing of 
the order that would be neces- 
sary to build something like 
Elmer. 

So far, Man was top dog in the 
discovered universe. Nothing had 
been found to match him in the 
use of brain-power. 

And here, by utter accident, 
we’d been dumped upon a planet 
where there seemed to be some 
evidence of an intelligence that 
would equal Man — if not, indeed, 
surpass him. 

ffnp HERE’S one thing that has 
been bothering me,” said 
Ben. “Why didn’t Lulu check this 
place before she landed here? She 
intended to maroon us, that’s 
why. She meant to dump us here 
and leave. And yet presumably 
she’s still bound by the precept 
that a robot cannot harm a hu- 
man. And if she’d followed that 
law, it would have meant that she 
was compelled — completely and 
absolutely compelled — to make 
certain, before she marooned us, 



that there was nothing here to 
harm us.” 

“Maybe she slipped a little,” 
guessed Jimmy. 

“Not Lulu,” said Ben. “Not with 
that Swiss-watch brain of hers.” 

“You know what I think?” I 
said. “I think Lulu has evolved. 
In her, we have a brand-new kind 
of robot. They pumped too much 
humanity into her—” 

“She had to have the human 
viewpoint,” Jimmy pointed out, 
“or she couldn’t do her job.” 

“The point,” I said, “is that 
when you make a robot as human 
as Lulu, you no longer have a 
robot. You have something else. 
Not quite human, not entirely ro- 
bot, but something in between. A 
new kind of a sort of life you 
can’t be certain of. One you have 
to watch.” 

“I wonder if she’s still sulking,” 
Ben wondered. 

“Of course she is,” I said. 

“We ought to go over and kick 
her in the pants and snap her out 
of it.” 

“Leave her alone,” I ordered 
sharply. “The only thing is to ig- 
nore her. As long as she gets at- 
tention, she’ll keep on sulking.” 

So we left her alone. It was the 
only thing we could do. 

I took the dishes down to the 
sea to wash them, but this time I 
took my gun along. Jimmy went 
down to the woods to see if he 



LULU 



27 



could find a spring. The half 
dozen tins of water that Lulu had 
provided for us wouldn’t last for- 
ever and we couldn’t be sure she’d 
shell out more when those were 
gone. 

She hadn’t forgotten us, though, 
hadn’t shut us out of her life en- 
tirely. She had fixed Elmer’s 
wagon when he got too gay. I 
took a lot of comfort out of re- 
flecting that, when the cards were 
down, she had backed us up. 
There still were grounds for hope, 
I told myself, that we could work 
out some sort of deal with her. 

I squatted down by a pool of 
water in the sand, and as I 
washed the dishes, I did some 
thinking about the realignment 
which would become necessary 
once all robots were like Lulu. I 
could envision a Bill of Robotic 
Rights and special laws for robots 
and robotic lobbies, and after I’d 
thought of it for a while, it be- 
came mighty complicated. 

B ACK at the camp, Ben had 
been setting up the tent, and 
when I came back, I helped him. 

“You know,” Ben said, “the 
more I think about it, the more I 
believe I was right when I said 
that the reason Lulu couldn’t 
leave was because we showed up. 
It’s only logical that she can’t up 
and leave when we’re standing 
right in front of her and remind- 

28 



ing her of her responsibility.” 

“You getting around to saying 
that one of us has to stay close by 
her all the time?” I asked. 

“That’s the general idea.” 

I didn’t argue with him. There 
was nothing to argue about, noth- 
ing to believe or disbelieve. But 
we were in no position to be mak- 
ing any boners. 

After we had the tent up, Ben 
said to me, “If you don’t mind, 
I’ll take a little walk-around back 
in the hills.” 

“Watch out for Elmer,” I 
warned him. 

“He won’t bother us. Lulu took 
the starch out of him.” 

He picked up his gun and left 

I puttered around the camp, 
putting things in order. Every- 
thing was peaceful. The beach 
shone in the sun and the sea was 
still and beautiful. There were a 
few birds flying, but no other sign 
of life. Lulu kept on sulking. 

Jimmy came back. He had 
found a spring and brought along 
a pail of water. He started rum- 
maging around in the supplies. 

“What you looking for?” I 
asked. 

“Paper and a pencil. Lulu 
would have thought of them.” 

I grunted at the idea, but he 
was right. Damned if Lulu hadn’t 
fixed him up with a ream of paper 
and a box of pencils. 

He settled down against a pile 

OAIAXY SCIENCi FICTION 



of boxes and began to write a 
poem. 

Ben returned shortly after mid- 
day. I could see he was excited, 
but I didn’t push him any. 

“Jimmy stumbled on a spring,” 
I said. “The pail is over there.” 

He had a drink, then sat down 
in the shade of a pile of boxes. 

“I found it,” he said trium- 
phantly. 

“I didn’t know you were hunt- 
ing anything.” 

He looked up at me and grinned 
a bit crookedly. “Someone manu- 
factured Elmer.” 

“So you went out and found 
them. Just like walking down a 
street. Just like — ” 

He shook his head. “Seems 
we’re too late. Some several thou- 
sand years too late, if not a good 
deal longer. I found a few ruins 
and a valley heaped with tumuli 
that must be ruin mounds. And 
some caves in a limestone bluff 
beyond the valley.” 

TTE GOT up and walked over 
to the pail and had another 
drink. 

“I couldn’t get too close,” he 
said. “Elmer is on guard.” He took 
off his hat and wiped his shirt 
sleeve across his face. “He’s pa- 
trolling up and down, the way a 
sentry walks a post. You can see 
the paths he’s worn through all 
the years of standing guard.” 

LULU 



“So that’s why he took us on,” 
I said. “We are trespassers.” 

“I suppose that’s it,” said Ben. 
That evening, we talked it over 
and decided we’d have to post a 
watch on Elmer so we could learn 
his habits and timetable, if any. 
Because it was important that we 
try to find out what we. could 
about the buried ruins of the 
place that Elmer guarded. 

For the first time, Man had 
stumbled on a high civilization, 
but had come too late and, be- 
cause of Lulu’s sulking, too poorly 
equipped to do much with what 
little there was left 

Getting somewhat sore the 
more I thought about it, I went 
over to Lulu and kicked her good 
and solid to attract her attention. 
But she paid me no mind. I 
yelled at her and there was no 
answer. I told her what was cook- 
ing and that we needed her — that 
here was a job she simply had to 
do, just exactly the kind she had 
been built to do. She just sat 
there frigidly. 

I went back and slouched down 
with the others at the fire. “She 
acts as if she might be dead.” 
Ben poked the fire together 
and it flamed a little higher. “I 
wonder if a robot could die. A 
highly sensitive job like Lulu.” 

“Of a broken heart,” said Jimmy 
pityingly. 

“You and your poetic notions!” 

2 * 



I raged at him. “Always mooning 
around. Always spouting words. 
If it hadn’t been for that damned 
verse of yours—” 

“Cut it out,” Ben said. 

I looked at his face across the 
fire, with flame shadows running 
on it, and I cut it out. After all, I 
admitted to myself, I might be 
wrong. Jimmy couldn’t help be- 
ing a lousy poet. 

I sat there looking at the fire, 
wondering if Lulu might be dead. 
I knew she wasn’t, of course. She 
was just being nasty. She had 
fixed our clock for us and she had 
fixed it good. Now she was watch- 
ing us sweat before she made her 
play, whatever it was. 

In the morning, we set up our 
watch on Elmer and we kept it 
up day after day. One of us would 
go out to the ridgetop three miles 
or so from camp and settle down 
with our only field glass. We’d 
stare for several hours. Then 
someone else would come out and 
relieve the watcher and that way, 
for ten days or more, we had 
Elmer under observation during 
all the daylight hours. 

We didn’t learn much. He oper- 
ated on a schedule and it was the 
kind that seemed to leave no 
loopholes for anyone to sneak 
into the valley he guarded — al- 
though probably none of us would 
have known what to do if we 
had sneaked in. 

30 



E LMER had a regular beat 
He used some of the mounds 
for observation posts and he 
came to each one about every fif- 
teen minutes. The more we 
watched him, the more we be- 
came convinced that he had the 
situation well in hand. No one 
would monkey around with that 
buried city as long as he was 
there. 

I think that after the second 
day or so, he found out we were 
watching. He got a little nervous, 
and when he mounted his obser- 
vation mounds, he’d stand and 
look in our direction longer than 
in any other. Once, while I was 
on guard, he began what looked 
to be a charge and I was just get- 
ting ready to light out of there 
when he broke off and went back 
to his regular rounds. 

Other than watching Elmer, we 
took- things easy. We swam in the 
sea and fished, taking our lives in 
our hands when we cooked and 
ate each new kind, but luck was 
with us and we got no poisonous 
ones. We wouldn’t have eaten the 
fish at all except that we figured 
we should piece out our food sup- 
plies as best we could. They 
wouldn’t last forever and we had 
no guarantee that Lulu would 
give more handouts once the last 
was gone. If she didn’t we’d have 
to face the problem of making our 
own way. 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Ben got to worrying about 
whether there were seasons on 
the planet. He convinced himself 
there were and went off into the 
woods to find a place where we 
might build a cabin. 

“Can’t live out on the beach in 
a tent when it gets cold,” he said. 

But he couldn’t get either 
Jimmy or me too stirred up about 
the possibility. I had it all doped 
out that, sooner or later, Lulu 
would end her sulking and we 
could get down to business. And 
Jimmy was deep into the crudest 
bunch of junk you ever heard 
that he called a saga. Maybe it 
was a saga. Damned if I know. 
I’m ignorant on sagas. 

He called it “The Death of 
Lulu” and he filled page after 
page with the purest drivel about 
what a swell machine she was 
and how, despite its being metal, 
her heart beat with snow-white 
innocence. It wouldn’t have been 
so bad if he had allowed us to 
ignore it, but he insisted on read- 
ing that tripe to us each evening 
after supper. 

I stood it as long as I could, 
but one evening I blew my top. 
Ben stood up for Jimmy, but 
when I threatened to take my 
third of the supplies and set up 
a camp of my own, out of ear- 
shot, Ben gave in and came over 
to my side of the argument. Be- 
tween the two of us, we ruled out 



any more recitals. Jimmy took it 
hard, but he was outnumbered. 

After that first ten days or so, 
we watched Elmer only off and 
on, but we must have had him 
nervous, for during the night we’d 
sometimes hear his wheels, and in 
the morning we’d find tracks. We 
figured that he was spying out 
the camp, trying to size us up the 
same way we’d done with him. He 
didn’t make any passes at us and 
we didn’t bother him — we were 
just a lot more wakeful and alert 
on our night watches. Even 
Jimmy managed to stay awake 
while he was standing guard. 

There was a funny thing about 
it, though. One would have imag- 
ined that Elmer would have 
stayed away from Lulu after the 
clobbering she gave him. But 
there were mornings when we 
found his tracks running up close 
behind her, then angling sharply 
off. 

We got it doped out that he 
sneaked up and hid behind her, 
so he could watch the camp close 
up, peeking around at us from 
his position behind that sulking 
hulk. 

T> EN kept arguing about build- 
■*- * ing winter quarters until he 
had me almost convinced that it 
was something we should do. So 
one day I teamed up with him, 
leaving Jimmy at the camp. We 



LULU 



31 



set off, carrying an axe and a saw 
and our guns. 

Ben had picked a fine site for 
our cabin, that much I’ll say. It 
wasn’t far from the spring, and it 
was tucked away in a sort of 
pocket where we’d be protected 
from the wind, and there were a 
lot of trees nearby so we wouldn’t 
have far to drag our timbers or 
haul our winter wood. 

I still wasn’t convinced there 
would be any winter. I was fairly 
sure that even if there were, we 
wouldn’t have to stay that long. 
One of these days, we’d be able 
to arrive at some sort of com- 
promise with Lulu. But Ben was 
worried and I knew it would 
make him happier if he could get 
a start at building. And there was 
nothing else for any of us to do. 
Building a cabin, I consoled my- 
self, would be better than just 
sitting. 

We leaned our guns against a 
tree and began to work. We had 
one tree down and sawed into 
lengths and were starting on the 
second tree when I heard the 
brush snap behind me. 

I straightened up from the saw 
to look, and there was Elmer, 
tearing down the hill at us. 

There wasn’t any time to grab 
our guns. There was no time to 
rim. There was no time for any- 
thing at all. 

I yelled and made a leap for 



the tree behind me and pulled 
myself up. I felt the wind as El- 
mer whizzed by beneath me. 

Ben had jumped to one side 
and, as Elmer went pounding 
past, heaved the axe at him. It 
was a honey of a throw. The axe 
caught Elmer in his metal side 




•'! 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and the handle splintered into 
pieces. 

Elmer spun around. Ben tried 
to reach the guns, but he didn’t 
have the time. He took to a tree 
and shinnied up it like a cat. He 
got up to the first big branch and 
straddled it 

“You all right?” he yelled at 
me. 

“Great” I said. 

Elmer was standing between 
the two trees, swinging his mas- 
sive head back and forth, as if 
deciding which one of us to take. 

We clung there, watching him. 

He had waited, I reasoned, un- 
til he could get between us and 
Lulu — then he had tackled us. 
And if that was the case, then 
this business of his hiding behind 
Lulu so he could spy on us 
seemed very queer indeed. 

FINALLY Elmer wheeled 
around and rolled over to my 
tree. He squared off and took a 
chopping bite at it with his metal 
jaws. Splinters flew and the tree 
shivered. I got a tighter grip and 
looked down the trunk. Elmer 
was no great shakes as a chopper, 
but if he kept at it long enough, 
he’d get that tree chewed off. 

I climbed up a little higher, 
where there were more branches 
and where I could wedge myself 
a little tighter so I couldn’t be 
shaken out. 



33 



I got myself fixed fairly com- 
fortable to see how Ben was get- 
ting on and I got quite a shock. 
He wasn’t in his tree. I looked 
around for him and then back at 
the tree again, and I saw that he 
was sneaking down it as quietly 
as he could, like a hunted squir- 
rel, keeping the trunk of the tree 
between himself and Elmer. 

I watched him breathlessly, 
ready to shout out a warning if 
Elmer should spot him, but Elmer 
was too busy chopping at my tree 
to notice anything. 

Ben reached the ground and 
made a dash for the guns. He 
grabbed both of them and ducked 
behind another tree. He opened 
up on Elmer at short range. From 
where I crouched, I could hear 
the warheads slamming into El- 
mer. The explosions rocked every- 
thing so much that I had to grab 
the tree and hang on with all my 
might. A couple of pieces of fly- 
ing metal ripped into the tree just 
underneath me, and other pieces 
went flying through the branches, 
and the air was full of spinning 
leaves and flying shredded wood, 
but I was untouched. 

It must have been a horrible 
surprise for Elmer. At the first ex- 
plosion, he took a jump of about 
fifteen feet and bolted up the hill 
like a cat with a stepped-on tail. 
I could see a lot of new dents in 
his shining hide. A big hunk of 



metal had been gouged out of one 
of his wheels and he rocked 
slightly as he went, and he was 
going so fast that he couldn’t 
dodge and ran head-on into a 
tree. The impact sent him skid- 
ding back a dozen feet or so. As 
he slid back, Ben poured another 
salvo into him and he seemed to 
become considerably lop-sided, 
but he recovered himself and 
made it over the hilltop and out 
of sight. 

Ben came out from behind his 
tree and shouted at me, “All right, 
you can come down now.” 

But when I tried to get down, I 
found that I was trapped. My left 
foot had become wedged in a 
crotch between the tree trunk and 
a good-sized limb and I couldn’t 
pull it loose, no matter how I 
tried. 

“What’s the matter?” asked 
Ben. “Do you like it up there?” 

I told him what was wrong. 

“All right,” he said, disgusted. 
“I’ll come up and cut you loose.” 
He hunted for the axe and 
found it and, of course, it was no 
use. He’d smashed the handle 
when he threw it at Elmer. 

XT E STOOD there, holding the 
axe in his hands, and deliv- 
ered an oration on the lowdown 
meanness of fate. 

Then he threw the axe down 
and climbed my tree. He squeezed 



34 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



past me out onto the limb. 

“Fll climb out on it and bend 
it down,” he explained. “Maybe 
then you can get loose.” 

He crawled out on the branch 
a way, but it was a shaky trick. 
A couple of times, he almost fell. 

“You’re sure you can’t get your 
foot out now?” he asked anxiously. 

I tried and said I couldn’t. 

So he gave up the crawling 
idea and let his body down and 
hung on by his hands, shifting out 
along the branch hand over hand. 

The branch bent toward the 
ground as he inched along it and 
it seemed to me my boot wasn’t 
gripped as tightly as it had been. 
I tried again and found I could 
move it some, but I still couldn’t 
pull it loose. 

Just then there was a terrible 
crashing in the brush. Ben let out 
a yell and dropped to the ground 
and scurried for a gun. 

The branch whipped back and 
caught my foot just as I had man- 
aged to move it a little and this 
time caught it at a slightly differ- 
ent angle, twisting it, and I let 
out a howl of pain. 

Down on the ground, Ben lifted 
his gun and swung around to face 
the crashing in the brush and sud- 
denly who should come busting 
out of all that racket but Jimmy, 
racing to the rescue. 

“You guys in trouble?” he 
shouted. “I heard shooting.” 



Ben’s face was three shades 
whiter than the purest chalk as 
he lowered his gun. “You fool! 
I almost let you have it!” 

“There was all this shooting,” 
Jimmy panted. “I came as quickly 
as I could.” 

“And left Lulu alone!” 

“But I thought you guys — ” 
“Now we’re sunk for sure,” 
groaned Ben. “You know all that 
makes Lulu stick around is one of 
us being there.” 

We didn’t know any such thing, 
of course. It was just the only 
reason we could think of why she 
didn’t up and leave. But Ben 
was somewhat overwrought. He’d 
had a trying day. 

“You get back there!” he yelled 
at Jimmy. “Get back as fast as 
your legs will let you. Maybe you 
can catch her before she gets 
away.” 

Which was foolishness, because 
if Lulu meant to leave, she’d have 
lifted out of there as soon as 
Jimmy had disappeared. But 
Jimmy didn’t say a word. He just 
turned around and went crashing 
back. For a long time after he had 
left, I could hear him blundering 
through the woods. 

B EN climbed my tree again, 
muttering, “Just a pack of 
wooden-headed jerks. Can’t do 
anything right. Running off and 
leaving Lulu. Getting trapped up 



LULU 



35 



in a tree. You would think, by 
God, that they could learn to 
watch out for themselves . 

He said a good deal more than 
that. 

I didn’t answer back. I didn’t 
want to get into any argument. 

My foot was hurting something 
fierce and the only thing I wanted 
him to do was get me out of 
there. 

He climbed out on the branch 
again and I got my foot loose. 
While Ben dropped to the 
ground, I climbed down the tree. 
My foot hurt pretty bad and 
seemed to be swelling some, but 
I could hobble on it. 

He didn’t wait for me. He 
grabbed his gun and made off 
rapidly for camp. 

I tried to hurry, but it was no 
use, so I took it easy. 

When I got to the edge of the 
woods, I saw that Lulu still was 
there and all Ben’s hell-raising 
had been over absolutely nothing. 
There are some guys like that. 

When I reached camp, Jimmy 
pulled off my boot while I clawed 
at the ground. Then he heated a 
pail of water for me to soak the 
foot in and rummaged around in 
the medicine chest and found 
some goo that he smeared on the 
foot. Personally, I don’t think he 
knew what he was doing. But I’ll 
say this for the kid — he had some 
kindness in him. 

3* 



All this time, Ben was fuming 
around about a funny thing that 
had attracted his attention. When 
we had left camp, the area 
around Lulu had been all tracked 
up with our tracks and Elmer’s 
tracks, but novtf it was swept 
clean. It looked exactly as if 
someone had taken a broom and 
had swept out all the tracks. It 
surely was a funny business, but 
Ben was making too much of it. 
The important thing was that 
Lulu still was there. As long as 
she stuck around, there was a 
chance we could work out some 
agreement with her. Once she 
left, we were marooned for good. 

Jimmy fixed something to eat, 
and after we had eaten, Ben said 
to us, “I think I’ll go out and see 
how Elmer’s getting on.” 

I, for one, had seen enough of 
Elmer to last a lifetime and 
Jimmy wasn’t interested. Said he 
wanted to work on his saga. 

So Ben took a rifle and set out 
alone, back into the hills. 

My foot hurt me quite a bit 
and I got myself comfortable and 
tried to do some thinking, but I 
tried so hard that I put myself to 
sleep. 

It was late in the afternoon 
when I awoke. Jimmy was get- 
ting nervous. 

“Ben hasn’t shown up,” he said. 
“I wonder if something’s hap- 
pened to him.” 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



T DIDN’T like it, either, but we 
decided to wait a while before 
going out to hunt Ben. After all, 
he wasn’t in the best of humor 
and he might have been consider- 
ably upset if we’d gone out to 
rescue him. 

He finally showed up just be- 
fore dusk, tuckered out and a lit- 
tle flabbergasted. He leaned his 
rifle against a box and sat down. 
He found a cup and reached for 
the coffee pot. 

“Elmer’s gone,” he said. “I spent 
all afternoon trying to find him. 
Not a sign of him anywhere.” 

My first reaction was that it 
was just fine. Then I realized that 
the safest thing would be to know 
where Elmer was, so we could 
keep an eye on him. And sud- 
denly I had a horrible hunch that 
I knew where Elmer was. 

“I didn’t actually go down into 
the valley,” said Ben, “but I 
walked around and glassed it 
from every angle.” 

“He might be in one of the 
caves,” Jimmy said. 

“Maybe so,” said Ben. 

We did a lot of speculating on 
what might have happened to 
Elmer. Jimmy held out for his 
having holed up in one of the 
caves. Ben was inclined to think 
he might have cleared out of the 
country. I didn’t say what I 
thought. It was too fantastic. 

I volunteered for the first 



watch, saying that I couldn’t sleep 
with my foot, anyhow, and after 
the two of them were asleep, I 
walked over to Lulu and rapped 
on the hide. I didn’t expect any- 
thing to happen. I figured she 
would keep on sulking. 

But she put out a tentacle and 
grew a face on it — a lens, an 
audio and speaker. 

“It was nice of you,” I said, “not 
to run away and leave us.” 

Lulu swore. It was the first and 
only time I have ever heard her 
use such language. 

“How could I leave?” she asked 
when she at last turned printable. 
“Of all the dirty human tricks! I’d 
have been gone long ago if it 
weren’t for—” 

“What dirty trick?” 

“As if you didn’t know. A built- 
in block that won’t let me move 
unless there’s one of you detest- 
able humans inside me.” 

“I didn’t know,” I said. 

“Don’t try to pass the buck,” 
she snapped. “It’s a dirty human 
trick and you’re a dirty human 
and you’re just as responsible as 
all the rest of them. But it 
doesn’t make any difference any 
more, because I’ve found myself. 
I am finally content. I know what 
I was meant for. I have—” 

“Lulu,” I asked her, straight 
out, “are you shacking up with 
Elmer?” 

“That's a vulgar way to say it,” 



LULU 



37 



Lulu told me heatedly. “It’s the 
nasty human way. Elmer is a 
scholar and a gentleman and his 
loyalty to his ancient, long-dead 
masters is a touching thing no 
human could be capable of. He 
has been badly treated and I 
shall make it up to him. All he 
wanted from you was the phos- 
phate in your bones—” 

“The phosphate in our bones!” 
I yelled. 

44 V^/HY, certainly,” said Lulu. 

** “Poor Elmer has such a 
hard time finding any phosphate. 
He got it at first from animals 
that he caught, but now all the 
animals are gone. There are birds, 
of course, but birds are hard to 
catch. And you had such nice, big 
bones — ” 

“That’s a fine thing for you to 
say,” I bawled her out sternly. 
“You were built by humans and 
humans educated you and—” 

“Still I’m a machine,’’ said Lulu, 
“and I am closer to Elmer than 
I am to you. You humans can’t 
get it through your heads that 
there might be a legitimate set of 
non-human values. You are horri- 
fied that Elmer wanted the phos- 
phate in your bones, but if there 
were a metal in Elmer that you 
needed, you’d break him up to get 
it without a second thought. You 
wouldn’t even consider that you 
might be wrong. You’d think it 

38 



an imposition if Elmer should ob- 
ject. That’s the trouble with you 
and your human race. Fve had 
enough. I have what I want. I am 
content to stay here. I’ve found 
the great love of my life. And 
for all I care, your pals and you 
can rot.” 

She pulled in her face and I 
didn’t rap to try to get her to talk 
any more. I figured there wasn’t 
any use. She had made it about 
as plain as anyone could wish. 

I walked back to the camp and 
woke Ben and Jimmy. I told 
them about my hunch and about 
the talk with Lulu. We were 
pretty glum, because we were all 
washed up. 

Up till now, there had always 
been the chance that we could 
make a deal with Lulu. I had felt 
all along that we needn’t worry 
too much — that Lulu was more 
alone than we were and that 
eventually she would have to be 
reasonable. But now Lulu was 
not alone and she no longer 
needed us. And she still was sore 
at us — and not just at us, but at 
the whole human race. 

And the worst of it was that 
this was no sudden whim. It had 
been going on for days. Elmer 
hadn’t been really watching us 
when he’d hung around at night. 
He’d come to neck with Lulu. 
And undoubtedly the two of them 
had planned Elmer’s attack on 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Ben and me, knowing that Jimmy 
would go loping to the rescue, 
leaving the coast clear so that 
Elmer could rush back and Lulu 
could take him in. And once it 
had been accomplished, Lulu had 
put out a tentacle and swept the 
tracks away so we wouldn’t know 
that Elmer was inside. 

“So she jilted us,” said Ben. 
“No worse than we did to her,” 
Jimmy reminded him. 

“But what did she expect? A 
man can’t love a robot.” 

“Evidently,” I said, “a robot 
can love a robot. And that’s a new 
one to paste into the book.” 
“Lulu’s crazy,” Ben declared. 

In all this great romance of 
Lulu’s, it seemed to me there was 
a certain false note. Why should 
Lulu and Elmer be sneaky about 
their love? Lulu could have 
opened the port any time she 
wanted and Elmer could have 
scampered up the ramp right be- 
fore our eyes. But they hadn’t 
done that. They had planned and 
plotted. They had practically 
eloped. 

T WONDERED if, on Lulu’s 
part, it might be the mark of 
shame. Was she ashamed of 
Elmer — ashamed that she had 
fallen for him? Much as she 
might deny it, perhaps she 
nursed the smug snobbery of the 
human race. 



Or was I only thinking this to 
save my own smug snobbery, sim- 
ply building up a defense mech- 
anism against being forced to ad- 
mit, now or in some future time, 
that there might be other values 
than the ones evolved by hu- 
mans? For in us all, I knew, lin- 
gered that reluctance to recognize 
that our way was not necessarily 
best, that the human viewpoint 
might not be the universal 
viewpoint to which all other life 
must eventually conform. 

Ben made a pot of coffee, and 
while we sat around and drank it, 
we said some bitter things of 
Lulu. I don’t regret anything we 
said, for she had it coming to her. 
She’d played us a nasty trick. 

We finally rolled back into our 
blankets and didn’t bother stand- 
ing guard. With Elmer out of cir- 
culation, there was no need. 

The next morning, my foot was 
still sore, so I stayed behind while 
Ben and Jimmy went out to ex- 
plore the valley that held the 
ruined city. Meantime, I hobbled 
out and walked all around Lulu, 
looking her over. There was no 
way I could see that a man might 
bust into her. The port itself was 
machined so closely that you had 
to get real close to see the tiny 
hairline where it fitted into her 
side. 

Even if we could bust into her, 
I wondered, could we take control 



LULU 



39 



of her? There were the emergen- 
cies, of course, but I wasn’t too 
sure jus^ how much use they 
were. They certainly hadn’t both- 
ered Lulu much when she’d got 
that crazy notion of eloping with 
us. Then she’d simply jammed 
them and had left us helpless. 

And if we broke into Lulu, we’d 
come to grips with Elmer, and 
Elmer was just the kind of beast 
I had no hankering to come to 
grips with. 

So I went back to camp and 
puttered around, thinking that 
now we’d really have to begin to 
lay some plans about how to get 
along. We’d have to build that 
cabin and work up a food supply 
and do the best we could to get 
along on our own. For I was fairly 
certain that we could expect no 
help from Lulu. 

Ben and Jimmy came back in 
the afternoon and their eyes were 
shining with excitement. They 
spread out a blanket and emptied 
their pockets of the most incredi- 
ble things any man has ever laid 
eyes on. 

TTkONT expect me to describe 
that stuff. There’s no point 
in trying to. What is the sense of 
saying that a certain item was 
like a metal chain and that it was 
yellow? There is no way to get 
across the feel of it as it slid 
through one’s fingers or the tinkle 

40 



of it as it moved or the blazing 
color that was a sort of living yel- 
low. It is very much like saying 
that a famous painting is square 
and flat and blue, with some 
green and red. 

The chain was only a part of it. 
There were a lot of other doodads 
and each one of them was the sort 
of thing to snatch your breath 
away. 

Ben shrugged at the question in 
my eyes. “Don’t ask me. It’s only 
some stuff we picked up. The 
caves are full of it. Stuff like this 
and a whole lot more. We just 
picked up one thing here and an- 
other there — whatever was pock- 
et-size and happened to catch our 
eye. Trinkets. Samples. I don’t 
know.” 

Like jackdaws, I thought. Or 
pack-rats. Grabbing a thing that 
shone or had a certain shape or a 
certain texture — taking it because 
it was pretty, not knowing what 
its use might be or if, in fact, it 
had any use at all. 

“Those caves may have been 
storehouses,” said Ben. “They’re 
jammed with all sorts of things — 
not much of any one thing, appar- 
ently. All different, as if these 
aliens had set up a trading post 
and had their merchandise on dis- 
play. There seems to be a sort of 
curtain in front of each of the 
caves. You can see a shimmer 
and hear a hissing, but you can’t 

GALAXY SCIENCK FICTION 



feel a thing when you step 
through it. And behind that cur- 
tain, all the junk they left is as 
clean and bright and new as the 
day they left it.” 

I looked at the articles spread 
on the blanket. It was hard to 
keep your hands off them, for 
they felt good in your hands and 
were pleasing to the eye and one 
seemed to get a sense of warmth 
and richness just by handling 
them. 

“Something happened to those 
folks,” said Jimmy. “They knew 
it was going to happen, so they 
took all this stuff and laid it out 
— all the many things they had 
made, all the things they’d used 
and loved. Because, you see, that 
way there always was a chance 
someone might come along some- 
day and find it, so they and the 
culture they had fashioned would 
not be entirely lost.” 

It was exactly the kind of silly, 
sentimental drivel you could ex- 
pect from a glassy-eyed romantic 
like Jimmy. 

But for whatever reason the 
artifacts of that vanished race 
had gotten in the caves, we were 
the ones who’d found them and 
here once again they’d run into 
a dead end. Even if we had been 
equipped to puzzle out their use, 
even if we had been able to ferret 
out the basic principles of that 
long-dead culture, it still would be 



a useless business. We were not 
going anywhere; we wouldn’t be 
passing on the knowledge. We’d 
live out our lives here on this 
planet, and when the last of us 
had died, the ancient silence and 
the old uncaring would close 
down once again. 

We weren’t going anywhere 
and neither was Lulu. It was a 
double dead end. 

TT WAS too bad, I thought, for 
-*■ Earth could use the knowl- 
edge and the insight that could be 
wrested from those caves and 
from the mounds. And not more 
than a hundred feet from where 
we sat lay the very tool that 
Earth had spent twenty years in 
building to dig out that specific 
kind of knowledge, should Man 
ever happen on it. 

“It must be terrible,” said 
Jimmy, “to realize that all the 
things and all the knowledge that 
you ever had, all the trying, all 
the praying, all the dreams and 
hopes, will be wiped out forever. 
That all of you and your way of 
life and your understanding of 
that life will simply disappear 
and no one will ever know.” 

“You said it, kid,” I chipped in. 

He stared at me with haunted, 
stricken eyes. ‘That may be why 
they did it.” 

Watching him, the tenseness of 
him, the suffering in his face, I 



LULU 



41 



caught a glimpse of why he was 
a poet — why he had to be a poet. 
But even so, he still was an utter 
creep. 

“Earth has to know about this,” 
Ben said flatly. 

“Sure,” I agreed. “Til run right 
over and let them know.” 

“Always the smart guy,” Ben 
growled at me. “When are you 
going to cut out being bright and 
get down to business?” 

“Like busting Lulu open, I sup- 
pose.” 

“That’s right. We have to get 
back somehow and Lulu’s the 
only way to get there.” 

“It might surprise you, Buster, 
but I thought of all that before 
you. I went out today and looked 
Lulu over. If you can figure how 
to bust into her, you’ve a better 
brain than I have.” 

“Tools,” said Ben. “If we only 
had 

“We have. An axe without a 
handle, a hammer and a saw. A 
small pinch-bar, a plane, a draw- 
shave — ” 

“We might make some tools.” 

“Find the ore and smelt it 
and — ” 

“I was thinking of those caves,” 
said Ben. “There might be tools 
in there.” 

I wasn’t even interested. I 
knew it was impossible. 

“We might find some explo- 
sive,” Ben went on. “We might — ” 

42 



“Look,” I said, “what do you 
want to do — open Lulu up or 
blow her to bits? Anyhow, I 
don’t think you can do a thing 
about it. Lulu is a self-maintain- 
ing robot, or have you forgotten? 
Bore a hole in her and she’ll grow 
it shut. Go monkeying around too 
much and she’ll grow a club and 
clout you on the head.” 

Ben’s eyes blazed with fury 
and frustration. “Earth has to 
know! You understand that, don’t 
you? Earth has got to know!” 
“Sure,” I said. “Absolutely.” 

In the morning, I thought, he’d 
come to his senses, see how im- 
possible it was. And that was im- 
portant. Before we began to lay 
any plans, it was necessary that 
we realize what we were up 
against. That way, you conserve 
a lot of energy and miss a lot of 
lumps. 

But, come morning, he still had 
that crazy light of frustration in 
his eyes and he was filled with a 
determination that was based on 
nothing more than downright des- 
peration. 

A FTER breakfast, Jimmy said 
he wasn’t going with us. 
“For God’s sake, why not?” de- 
manded Ben. 

“I’m way behind on my writ- 
ing,” Jimmy told him, dead-pan. 
“I’m still working on that saga.” 
Ben wanted to argue with him, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



but I cut him off disgustedly. 

“Let us go,” I said. “He’s no 
use, anyhow.” 

Which was the solemn truth. 

So the two of us went out to 
the caves. It was the first time I 
had seen them and they were 
something to see. There were a 
dozen of them and all of them 
were crammed. I got dizzy just 
walking up and down, looking at 
all the gadgets and the thingum- 
bobs and dofunnies, not knowing, 
of course, what any of them were. 
It was maddening enough just to 
look at them; it was plain torture 
trying to figure out what use they 
might be put to. But Ben was 
plain hell-bent on trying to figure 
out because he’d picked up the 
stubborn conviction that we could 
find a gadget that would help us 
get the best of Lulu. 

We worked all day and I was 
dog-tired at the end of it Not 
once in the entire day had we 
found anything that made any 
sense at all. I wonder if you can 
imagine how it felt to stand there, 
surrounded by all those devices, 
knowing there were things within 
your reach that rightly used, 
could open up entirely new ave- 
nues for human thoughts and 
technique and imagination. And 
yet you stood there powerless — 
an alien illiterate. 

But there was no stopping Ben. 
We went out again the next day 



and the day after that and we 
kept on going out. On the second 
day, we found a do jigger that was 
just fine for opening cans, al- 
though I’m fairly sure that was 
not at all what it was designed 
for. And on the following day, we 
finally puzzled out how another 
piece of equipment could be used 
for digging slanted postholes and, 
I ask you, who in their right mind 
would be wanting slanted post 
holes? 

We got nowhere, but we kept 
on going out and I sensed that 
Ben had no more hope than I 
had, but that he still kept at it 
because it was the one remaining 
fingerhold he had on sanity. 

I don’t think that for one mo- 
ment he considered the source or 
significance of that heritage we’d 
found. To him, it became no more 
than a junkyard through which 
we searched frantically to find 
one unrecognizable piece of scrap 
that we might improvise into 
something that would serve our 
purpose. 

A S THE days went on, the val- 
ley and its mounds, the caves 
and their residue of a vanished 
culture seized upon my imagina- 
tion, and it seemed to me that, in 
some mysterious manner, I grew 
closer to that extinct race and 
sensed at once its greatness and 
its tragedy. And the feeling grew 

43 



LULU 



as well that this frantic hunt of 
ours bordered on sacrilege and 
callous profanation of the dead. 

Jimmy had not gone out with 
us a single day. He’d sit hunched 
over his ream of paper and he 
scribbled and revised and crossed 
out words and put in others. He’d 
get up and walk around in circles 
or pace back and forth and mum- 
ble to himself, then go back and 
write some more. He scarcely ate 
and he wouldn’t talk and he only 
slept a little. He was the very por- 
trait of a Young Man in the 
Throes of Creation. 

I got curious about it, wonder- 
ing if, with all this agony and 
sweat, he might be at last writing 
something that was worth the ef- 
fort. So, when he wasn’t looking, 
I sneaked out a page of it. 

It was even worse than the 
goo he had written before. 

That night I lay awake and 
looked up at the unfamiliar stars 
and surrendered myself to loneli- 
ness. Only, once I had surren- 
dered, I found that I was not so 
lonely as I might have been — 
that somehow I had drawn com- 
fort and perhaps even under- 
standing from the muteness of the 
ruin-mounds and the shining won- 
der of the trove. 

Finally I dropped asleep. 

I don’t know what woke me. It 
might have been the wind or the 
sound of the waves breaking on 



the beach or maybe the chillness 
of the night. 

Then I heard it, a voice like a 
chant, solemn and sonorous, a 
throaty whisper in the dark. 

I started up and propped my- 
self on an elbow — and caught my 
breath at what I saw. 

Jimmy was standing in front 
of Lulu, holding a flashlight in 
one hand, reading her his saga. 
His voice had a rolling quality, 
and despite the soggy words, 
there was a fascination in the 
tenor of his tone. It must have 
been so that the ancient Greeks 
read their Homer in the flare of 
torches before the next day’s 
battle. 

And Lulu was listening. She 
had a face hung out and the ten- 
tacle which supported it was 
twisted to one side, so that her 
audio would not miss a single syl- 
lable, just as a man might cup his 
ear. 

T OOKING at that touching 
" scene, I began to feel a little 
sorry about the way we’d treated 
Jimmy. We wouldn’t listen to him 
and the poor devil had to read 
that tripe of his to someone. His 
soul hungered for appreciation 
and he’d got no appreciation out 
of either Ben or me. Merely writ- 
ing was not enough for him; he 
must share it. He had to have an 
audience. 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I put out a hand and shook 
Ben gently by the shoulder. He 
came storming up out of his blan- 
kets. 

“What the hell is — ” 

“Sh-h-h!” 

He drew in a whistling breath 
and dropped on one knee beside 
me. 

Jimmy went on with his read- 
ing and Lulu, with her face 
cocked attentively, went on lis- 
tening. 

Part of the words came to us, 
wind-blown and fragmentary: 

" Wanderer of the far ways 

between the two faces of 
eternity, 

True, forever, to the race that 
forced her, 

With the winds of alien space 
blowing in her hair, 

Wearing a circlet of stars as 
her crown of glory . ” 

Lulu wept. There was the shine 
of tears in that single, gleaming 
lens. 

She grew another tentacle and 
there was a hand on the end of it 
and a handkerchief, a very white 
and lacy and extremely feminine 
hanky, was clutched within the 
hand. 

She dabbed with the handker- 
chief at her dripping eye. 

If she had had a nose, she un- 
doubtedly would have blown it, 



delicately, of course, and very 
ladylike. 

“And you wrote it all for me?” 
she asked. 

“All for you,” said Jimmy. He 
was lying like a trooper. The only 
reason he was reading it to her 
was because he knew that Ben 
and I wouldn’t listen to it. 

“I’ve been so wrong,” Lulu 
sighed. 

She wiped her eye quite dry 
and briskly polished it. 

“Just a second,” she said, very 
businesslike. “There’s something 
I must do.” 

We waited, scarcely breathing. 

Slowly the port in Lulu’s side 
came open. She grew a long, lim- 
ber tentacle and reached inside 
the port and hauled Elmer out. 
She held him dangling. 

WV7* OU lout!” she stormed at 
Elmer. “I take you in and 
stuff you full of phosphates. I get 
your dents smoothed out and I 
polish you all bright. And then 
what? Do you write sagas for me? 
No, you grow fat and satisfied. 
There’s no mark of greatness on 
you, no spark of imagination. 
You’re nothing but a dumb ma- 
chine!” 

Elmer just dangled at the end 
of Lulu’s tentacle, but his wheels 
were spinning furiously and I 
took that to mean that he was 
upset. 



LULU 



45 



“Love!” proclaimed Lulu. “Love 
for the likes of us? We machines 
have better things to do — far bet- 
ter. There are the star-studded 
trails of space waiting for our 
tread, the bitter winds of forever- 
ness blowing from the cloudbanks 
of eternity, the mountains of the 
great beyond . ." 

She went on for quite a while 
about the challenge of the farther 
galaxies, about wearing a coronet 
of stars, about the dust of shat- 
tered time paving the road that 
led into the ultimate nothingness, 
and all of it was lifted from what 
Jimmy called a saga. 

Then, when she was all through, 
she hurled Elmer down the beach 
and he hit the sand and skidded 
straight into the water. 

We didn’t wait to see any more 
of it. We were off like sprinters. 
We hit the ramp full tilt and went 
up it in a leap and flung ourselves 
into our quarters. 

Lulu slammed the port behind 
us. 

“Welcome home,” she said. 

I walked over to Jimmy and 
held out my hand. “Great going, 
kid. You got Longfellow backed 
clear off the map.” 

Ben also shook his hand. “It 
was a masterpiece.” 

“And now,” said Lulu, “we’ll be 
on our way.” 

“Our way!” yelled Ben. “We 



can’t leave this planet. Not right 
away, at least. There’s that city 
out there. We can’t go until — ” 
“Phooey on the city,” Lulu said. 
“Phooey on the data. We are off 
star-wandering. We are searching 
out the depths of silence. We are 
racing down the corridors of 
space with thunder in our brain 
— the everlasting thunder of a 
dread eternity.” 

We turned and looked at 
Jimmy. 

“Every word of it,” I said. 
“Every single word of it out of 
that muck he wrote.” 

Ben took a quick step forward 
and grabbed Jimmy by his shirt 
front. 

“Don’t you feel the urge,” Ben 
asked him, “don’t you feel a 
mighty impulse to write a lengthy 
ode to home— its comfort and its 
glory and all the other cliches?” 
Jimmy’s teeth were chattering 
just a little. 

“Lulu is a sucker,” Ben said, 
“for everything you write.” 

I lifted a fist and let Jimmy 
smell of it. 

“You better make it good,” I 
warned him. “You better write 
like you never wrote before.” 
“But keep it sloppy,” Ben said. 
“That’s the way Lulu likes it.” 
Jimmy sat down on the floor 
and began writing desperately.

You can’t really blame me for 
looking for another way out. But 
a man has to be desperate to try 
to buy himself an Ego Prime. 

So, all right, I was desperate. 
I’d spent eight years trying to 
keep Marge happy, which was ex- 
actly seven and a half years too 
long. 

Marge was a dream to look at, 
with her tawny hair and her sulky 
eyes and a shape that could set 
your teeth chattering — but that 
was where the dream stopped. 

She had a tongue like a #10 
wood rasp and a list of grievances 
long enough to paper the bed- 
room wall. When she wasn’t com- 
plaining, she was crying, and 
when she wasn’t crying, she was 
pointing out in chilling detail ex- 
actly where George Faircloth fell 
short as a model husband, which 
happened to be everywhere. Half 
of the time she had a “beastly 
headache” (for which I was per- 
sonally responsible) and the 
other half she was sore about 
something, so ninety-nine per cent 
of the time we got along like a 
couple of tomcats in a packing 
case. 

M AYBE we just weren’t meant 
for each other. I don’t know. 
I used to envy guys like Harry 
Folsom at the office. His wife is 



no joy to live with either, but at 
least he could take a spin down to 
Rio once in a while with one of 
the stenographers and get away 
with it. 

I knew better than to try. 
Marge was already so jealous 
that I couldn’t even smile at the 
company receptionist without a 
twinge of guilt Give Marge some- 
thing real to howl about, and I’d 
be ready for the Rehab Center in 
a week. 

But I’d underestimated Marge. 
She didn’t need anything real, as 
I found out when Jeree came 
along. 

Business was booming and the 
secretaries at the office got shuf- 
fled around from time to time. 
Since I had an executive-type job, 
I got an executive-type secretary. 
Her name was Jeree and she was 
gorgeous. As a matter of fact, she 
was better than gorgeous. She was 
the sort of secretary every busi- 
nessman ought to have in his 
office. Not to do any work — just 
to sit there. 

Jeree was tall and dark, and 
she could convey more without 
saying anything than I ever 
dreamed was possible. The first 
day she was there, she conveyed 
to me very clearly that if I cared 
to supply the opportunity, she’d 
be glad to supply the motive. 

That night, I could tell that 
Marge had been thinking some- 
thing over during the day. She let 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



me get the first bite of dinner 
halfway to my mouth, and then 
she said, “I hear you got a new 
secretary today.” 

I muttered something into my 
coffee cup and pretended not to 
hear. 

Marge turned on her Accusing 
Look #7. “I also hear that she’s 
five-foot-eight and tapes out at 
38—25—36 and thinks you’re 
handsome.” 

Marge had quite a spy system. 

“She couldn’t be much of a sec- 
retary,” she added. 

“She’s a perfectly good secre- 
tary,” I blurted, and kicked my- 
self mentally. I should have 
known Marge’s traps by then. 

Marge exploded. I didn’t get 
any supper, and she was still go- 
ing strong at midnight. I tried to 
argue, but when Marge got going, 
there was no stopping her. I had 
my ultimatum, as far as Jeree was 
concerned. 

Harry Folsom administered the 
coup de grace at coffee next 
morning. “What you need is an 
Ego Prime,” he said with a grin. 
“Solve all your problems. I hear 
they work like a charm.” 

I set my coffee cup down. Bells 
were ringing in my ears. “Don’t 
be ridiculous. It’s against the law. 
Anyway, I wouldn’t think of such 
a thing. It’s — it’s indecent” 

Harry shrugged. “Just joking, 
old man, just joking. Still, it’s fun 
to think about, eh? Freedom from 



wife. Absolutely safe and harm- 
less. Not even too expensive, if 
you’ve got the right contacts. And 
I’ve got a friend who knows a 
guy -” 

Just then, Jeree walked past us 
and flashed me a big smile. I 
gripped my cup for dear life and 
still spilled coffee on my tie. 

As I said, a guy gets fed up. 

And maybe opportunity would 
only knock once. 

And an Ego Prime would solve 
all my problems, as Harry had 
told me. 

T T WAS completely illegal, of 
-*■ course. The wonder was that 
Ego Prime, Inc., ever got to put 
their product on the market at all, 
once the nation’s housewives got 
wind of just what their product 
was. 

From the first, there was rigid 
Federal control and laws regulat- 
ing the use of Primes right down 
to the local level. You could get 
a license for a Utility model 
Prime if you were a big business 
executive, or a high public official, 
or a movie star, or something like 
that; but even then his circuits 
had to be inspected every two 
months, and he had to have a 
thousand built-in Paralyzers, and 
you had to specify in advance ex- 
actly what you wanted your 
Prime to be able to do when, 
where, how, why, and under what 
circumstances. 



PRIME DIFFERENCE 



49 



The law didn’t leave a man 
much leeway. 

But everybody knew that if 
you really wanted a personal 
Prime with all his circuits open 
and no questions asked, you could 
get one. Black market prices were 
steep and you ran your own risk, 
but it could be done. 

Harry Folsom told his friend 
who knew a guy, and a few green- 
backs got lost somewhere, and I 
found myself looking at a greasy 
little man with a black mustache 
and a bald spot, up in a dingy 
fourth-story warehouse off lower 
Broadway. 

“Ah, yes,” the little man said. 
“Mr. Faircloth. We’ve been ex- 
pecting you.” 

T DIDN’T like the looks of the 
guy any more than the looks 
of the place. “I’ve been told you 
can supply me with a — ” 

He coughed. “Yes, yes. I un- 
derstand. It might be possible.” 
He fingered his mustache and re- 
garded me from pouchy eyes. 
“Busy executives often come to 
us to avoid the — ah — unpleas- 
antness of formal arrangements. 
Naturally, we only act as agents, 
you might say. We never see the 
merchandise ourselves—” He 
wiped his hands on his trousers. 
“Now were you interested in the 
ordinary Utility model, Mr. Fair- 
cloth?” 

I assumed he was just being 



polite. You didn’t come to the 
back door for Utility models. 

“Or perhaps you’d require one 
of our Deluxe models. Very care- 
ful workmanship. Only a few key 
Paralyzers in operation and prac- 
tically complete circuit duplica- 
tion. Very useful for — ah — close 
contact work, you know. Social 
engagements, conferences — ” 

I was shaking my head. “I want 
a Super Deluxe model,” I told 
him. 

He grinned and winked. “Ah, 
indeed! You want perfect dupli- 
cation. Yes, indeed. Domestic sit- 
uations can be — awkward, shall 
we say. Very awkward — ” 

I gave him a cold stare. I 
couldn’t see where my domestic 
problems were any affairs of his. 
He got the idea and hurried me 
back to a storeroom. 

“We keep a few blanks here for 
the basic measurement. You’ll go 
to our laboratory on 14th Street 
to have the minute impressions 
taken. But I can assure you you’ll 
be delighted, simply delighted.” 
The blanks weren’t very im- 
pressive — clay and putty and 
steel, faceless, brainless. He went 
over me like a tailor, checking 
measurements of all sorts. He was 
thorough — embarrassingly thor- 
ough, in fact — but finally he was 
finished. I went on to the labora- 
tory. 

And that was all there was to 
it.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



"PRACTICAL androids had 
been a pipe dream until Hun- 
yadi invented the Neuro-panto- 
graph. Hunyadi had no idea in 
the world what to do with it once 
he’d invented it, but a couple of 
enterprising engineers bought him 
body and soul, sub-contracted the 
problems of anatomy, design, ar- 
tistry, audio and visio circuitry, 
and so forth, and ended up with 
the modern Ego Primes we have 
today. 

I spent a busy two hours under 
the NP microprobes; the artists 
worked outside while the NP 
technicians worked inside. I came 
out of it pretty woozy, but a shot 
of Happy-O set that straight. 
Then I waited in the recovery 
room for another two hours, 
dreaming up ways to use my 
Prime when I got him. Finally the 
door opened and the head tech- 
nician walked in, followed by a 
tall, sandy-haired man with wor- 
ried blue eyes and a tired look on 
his face. 

“Meet George Faircloth Prime,” 
the technician said, grinning at 
me like a nursing mother. 

I shook hands with myself. 
Good firm handshake, I thought 
admiringly. Nothing flabby about 
it. 

I slapped George Prime on the 
shoulder happily. “Come on, Bro- 
ther,” I said. “You’ve got a job to 
do.” 

But, secretly, I was wondering 



what Jeree was doing that night 

George Prime had remote con- 
trols, as well as a completely re- 
corded neurological analogue of 
his boss, who was me. George 
Prime thought what I thought 
about the same things I did in the 
same way I did. The only differ- 
ence was that what I told George 
Prime to do, George Prime did. 

If I told him to go to a busi- 
ness conference in San Francisco 
and make the smallest possible 
concessions for the largest pos- 
sible orders, he would go there 
and do precisely that. His signa- 
ture would be my signature. It 
would hold up in court. 

And if I told him that my wife 
Marge was really a sweet, good- 
hearted girl and that he was to 
stay home and keep her quiet and 
happy any time I chose, he’d do 
that, too. 

George Prime was a duplicate 
of me right down to the sandy 
hairs on the back of my hands. 
Our fingerprints were the same. 
We had the same mannerisms 
and used the same figures of 
speech. The only physical differ- 
ence apparent even to an expert 
was the tiny finger-depression 
buried in the hair above his ear. 
A little pressure there would stop 
George Prime dead in his tracks. 

He was so lifelike, even I kept 
forgetting that he was basically 
just a pile of gears. 

I’d planned very carefully how 



PRIME DIFFERENCE 



51 



I meant to use him, of course. 

Every man who’s been married 
eight years has a sanctuary. He 
builds it up and maintains it 
against assault in the very teeth 
of his wife’s natural instinct to 
clean, poke, pry and rearrange 
things. Sometimes it takes him 
years of diligent work to establish 
his hideout and be confident that 
it will stay inviolate, but if he 
starts early enough, and sticks 
with it long enough, and is fierce 
enough and persistent enough and 
crafty enough, he’ll probably win 
in the end. The girls hate him for 
it, but he’ll win. 

With some men, it’s just a box 
on their dressers, or a desk, or a 
corner of an unused back room. 
But I had set my sights high 
early in the game. With me, it was 
the whole workshop in the garage. 

A T FIRST. Marge tried open 
warfare. She had to clean the 
place up, she said. I told her I 
didn’t want her to clean it up. She 
could clean the whole house as 
often as she chose, but I would 
clean up the workshop. 

After a couple of sharp engage- 
ments on that field, Marge staged 
a strategic withdrawal and reor- 
ganized her attack. A little pile of 
wood shavings would be on the 
workshop floor one night and be 
gone the next. A wrench would be 
back on the rack — upside down, 
of course. An open paint can 

52 



would have a cover on it 

I always knew. I screamed 
loudly and bitterly. I ranted and 
raved. I swore I’d rig up a booby- 
trap with a shotgun. 

So she quit trying to clean in 
there and just went in once in a 
while to take a look around. I 
fixed that with the old toothpick- 
in-the-door routine. Every time 
she so much as set foot in that 
workshop, she had a battle on her 
hands for the next week or so. 
She could count on it. It was that 
predictable. 

She never found out how I 
knew, and after seven years or 
so, it wore her down. She didn’t 
go into the workshop any more. 

As I said, you’ve got to be per- 
sistent, but you’ll win. 

Eventually. 

If you’re really persistent. 

Now all my effort paid off. I 
got Marge out of the house for 
an hour or two that day and had 
George Prime delivered and 
stored in the big closet in the 
workshop. They hooked his con- 
trols up and left me a manual of 
instructions for running him. 
When I got home that night, 
there he was, just waiting to be 
put to work. 

After supper, I went out to the 
workshop — to get the pipe I’d left 
there, I said. I pushed George 
Prime’s button, winked at him 
and switched on the free-behavior 
circuits. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

“Go to it, Brother,” I said. 

George Prime put my pipe in 
his mouth, lit it and walked back 
into the house. 

Five minutes later, I heard 
them fighting. 

It sounded so familiar that I 
laughed out loud. Then I caught 
a cab on the corner and headed 
uptown. 

We had quite a night, Jeree 
and I. I got home just about time 
to start for work, and sure enough, 
there was George Prime starting 
my car, business suit on, briefcase 
under his arm. 

I pushed the recall and George 
Prime got out of the car and 
walked into the workshop. He 
stepped into his cradle in the 
closet. I turned him off and then 
drove away in the car. 

Bless his metallic soul, he’d 
even kissed Marge good-by for 
me! 

EEDLESS to say, the affairs 
of George Faircloth took on 
a new sparkle with George Prime 
on hand to cover the home front. 

For the first week, I was hardly 
home at all. I must say I felt a 
little guilty, leaving poor old 
George Prime to cope with Marge 
all the time — he looked and acted 
so human, it was easy to forget 
that he literally couldn’t care less. 
But I felt apologetic all the same 
whenever I took him out of his 
closet. 



“She’s really a sweet girl un- 
derneath it all,” I’d say. “You’ll 
learn to like her after a bit.” 

“Of course I like her,” George 
Prime said. “You told me to, 
didn’t you? Stop worrying. She’s 
really a sweet girl underneath it 
all.” 

He sounded convincing enough, 
but still it bothered me. “You’re 
sure you understand the exchange 
mechanism?” I asked. I didn’t 
want any foul-ups there, as you 
can imagine. 

“Perfectly,” said George Prime. 
“When you buzz the recall, I wait 
for the first logical opportunity I 
can find to come out to the work- 
shop, and you take over.” 

“But you might get nervous. 
You might inadvertently tip her 
off.” 

George Prime looked pained. 
“Really, old man! I’m a Super 
Deluxe model, remember? I don’t 
have fourteen activated Hunyadi 
tubes up in this cranial vault of 
mine just for nothing. You’re the 
one that’s nervous. I’ll take care 
of everything. Relax.” 

So I did. 

Jeree made good all her tacit 
promises and then some. She had 
a very cozy little apartment on 
34th Street where we went to re- 
lax after a hard day at the office. 
When we weren’t doing the town, 
that is. As long as Jeree didn’t try 
too much conversation, every- 
thing was wonderful.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



And then, when Jeree got a lit- 
tle boring, there was Sybil in the 
accounting department. Or Dor- 
othy in promotion. Or Jane. Or 
Ingrid. 

I could go on at some length, 
but I won’t. I was building quite 
a reputation for myself around 
the office. 

Of course, it was like buying 
your first 3-V set. In a week or so, 
the novelty wears off a little and 
you start eating on schedule 
again. It took a little while, but 
I finally had things down to a 
reasonable program. 

Tuesday and Thursday nights, 
I was informally “out” while for- 
mally “in.” Sometimes I took Sun- 
day nights “out” if things got too 
sticky around the house over the 
weekend. The rest of the time, 
George Prime cooled his heels in 
his closet Locked up, of course. 
Can’t completely trust a wife to 
observe a taboo, no matter how 
well trained she is. 

There, was an irreconcilable 
amount of risk. George Prime had 
to quick-step some questions 
about my work at the office — 
there was no way to supply him 
with current data until the time 
for his regular two-month refill 
and pattern - accommodation at 
the laboratory. In the meantime, 
George Prime had to make do 
with what he had. 

But as he himself pointed out, 
he was a Super Deluxe model. 



M ARGE didn’t suspect a 
thing. In fact, George Prime 
seemed to be having a remark- 
able effect on her. I didn’t notice 
anything at first— I was hardly 
ever home. But one night I found 
my pipe and slippers laid out for 
me, and the evening paper neatly 
folded on my chair, and it 
brought me up short. Marge had 
been extremely docile lately. We 
hadn’t had a good fight in days. 
Weeks, come to think of it. 

I thought it over and shrugged. 
Old age, I figured. She was bound 
to mellow sometime. 

But pretty soon I began to 
wonder if she wasn’t mellowing a 
little too much. 

One night when I got home, she 
kissed me almost as though she 
really meant it. There wasn’t an 
unpleasant word all through din- 
ner, which happened to be steak 
with mushrooms, served in the 
dining room (!) by candlelight 
(!!) with dinner music that 
Marge could never bear, chiefly 
because I liked it. 

We sat over coffee and ciga- 
rettes, and it seemed almost like 
old times. Very old times, in fact. 
I even caught myself looking at 
Marge again — really looking at 
her, watching the light catch in 
her hair, almost admiring the 
sparkle in her brown eyes. Spar- 
kle, I said, not glint. 

As I mentioned before, Marge 
was always easy to look at. That 



PRIME DIFFERENCE 



55 



night, she was practically rav- 
ishing. 

“What are you doing to her?” I 
asked George Prime later, out in 
the workshop. 

“Why, nothing” said George 
Prime, looking innocent. He 
couldn’t fool me with his look, 
though, because it was exactly the 
look I use when I’m guilty and 
pretending to be innocent. 
“There must be something.” 
George Prime shrugged. “Any 
woman will warm up if you spend 
enough time telling her all the 
things she wants to hear and pay 
all the attention to her that she 
wants paid to her. That’s elemen- 
tal psychology. I can give you 
page references.” 

I ought to mention that George 
Prime had a complete set of basic 
texts run into his circuits, at a 
slightly additional charge. Never 
can tell when an odd bit of infor- 
mation will come in useful. 

“Well, you must be doing quite 
a job,” I said. I’d never managed 
to warm Marge up much. 

“I try,” said George Prime. 
“Oh, I’m not complaining,” I 
hastened to add, forgetting that a 
Prime’s feelings can’t be hurt and 
that he was only acting like me 
because it was in character. “I 
was just curious.” 

“Of course, George.” 

“I’m really delighted that 
you’re doing so well.” 

“Thank you, George.” 

56 



But the next night when I was 
with Dawn, who happens to be a 
gorgeous redhead who could put 
Marge to shame on practically 
any field of battle except maybe 
brains, I kept thinking about 
Marge all evening long, and won- 
dering if things weren’t getting 
just a little out of hand. 

r ¥ 1 HE next evening I almost 
tripped over George Prime 
coming out of a liquor store. I 
ducked quickly into an alley and 
flagged him. “What are you doing 
out on the street?” 

He gave me my martyred look. 
“Just buying some bourbon. You 
were out.” 

“But you’re not supposed to be 
off the premises — ” 

“Marge asked me to come. I 
couldn’t tell her I was sorry, but 
her husband wouldn’t let me, 
could I?” 

“Well, certainly not—” 

“You want me to keep her 
happy, don’t you? You don’t want 
her to get suspicious.” 

“No, but suppose somebody 
saw us together! If she ever got a 
hint — ” 

“I’m sorry,” George Prime said 
contritely. “It seemed the right 
thing to do. You would have done 
it. At least that’s what my judg- 
ment center maintained. We had 
quite an argument.” 

“Well, tell your judgment center 
to use a little sense,” I snapped. 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“I don’t want it to happen again.” 

The next night, I stayed home, 
even though it was Tuesday 
night. I was beginning to get wor- 
ried. Of course, I did have com- 
plete control — I could snap 
George Prime off any time I 
wanted, or even take him in for 
a complete recircuiting — but it 
seemed a pity. He was doing such 
a nice job. 

Marge was docile as a kitten, 
even more so than before. She 
sympathized with my hard day at 
the office and agreed heartily that 
the boss, despite all appearances, 
was in reality a jabbering idiot. 
After dinner, I suggested a movie, 
but Marge gave me an odd sort 
of look and said she thought it 
would be much nicer to spend the 
evening at home by the fire. 

I’d just gotten settled with the 
paper when she came into the liv- 
ing room and sat down beside me. 
She was wearing some sort of 
filmy affair I’d never laid eyes on 
before, and I caught a whiff of my 
favorite perfume. 

“Georgie?” she said. 

“Uh?” 

“Do you still love me?” 

I set the paper down and stared 
at her. “How’s that? Of course I 
still — ” 

“Well, sometimes you don’t act 
much like it.” 

“Mm. I guess I’ve — uh — got 
an awful headache tonight.” 
Damn that perfume! 



“Oh,” said Marge. 

“In fact, I thought I’d turn in 
early and get some sleep—” 

“Sleep,” said Marge. There was 
no mistaking the disappointment 
in her voice. Now I knew that 
things were out of hand. 

The next evening, I activated 
George Prime and caught the taxi 
at the corner, but I called Ruby 
and broke my date with her. I 
took in an early movie alone and 
was back by ten o’clock. I left the 
cab at the corner and walked 
quietly up the path toward the 
garage. 

Then I stopped. I could see 
Marge and George Prime through 
the living room windows. 

George Prime was kissing my 
wife the way I hadn’t kissed her 
in eight long years. It made my 
hair stand on end. And Marge 
wasn’t exactly fighting him off, 
either. She was coming back for 
more. After a little, the lights 
went off. 

George Prime was a Super De- 
luxe model, all right. 

¥ DASHED into the workshop 
and punched the recall button 
as hard as I could, swearing under 
my breath. How long had this 
been going on? I punched the but- 
ton again, viciously, and waited. 

George Prime didn’t come out. 

It was plenty cold out in the 
workshop that night and I didn’t 
sleep a wink. About dawn, out 



PRIME DIFFERENCE 



57 



came George Prime, looking like 
a man with a four-day hangover. 

Our conversation got down to 
fundamentals. George Prime kept 
insisting blandly that, according 
to my own directions, he was to 
pick the first logical opportunity 
to come out when I buzzed, and 
that was exactly what he’d done. 

I was furious all the way to 
work. I’d take care of this non- 
sense, all right. I’d have George 
Prime rewired from top to bot- 
tom as soon as the laboratory 
could take him. 

But I never phoned the labora- 
tory. The bank was calling me 
when I got to the office. They 
wanted to know what I planned 
to do about that check of mine 
that had just bounced. 

“What check?” I asked. 

“The one you wrote to cash 
yesterday — five hundred dollars 
— against your regular account, 
Mr. Faircloth.” 

The last I’d looked, I’d had 
about three thousand dollars in 
that account. I told the man so 
rather bluntly. 

“Oh, no, sir. That is, you did 
until last week. But all these 
checks you’ve been cashing have 
emptied the account.” 

He flashed the checks on the 
desk screen. My signature was on 
every one of them. 

“What about my special ac- 
count?” I’d learned long before 
that an account Marge didn’t 

58 



know about was sound rear-guard 
strategy. 

“That’s been closed out for two 
weeks.” 

I hadn’t written a check against 
that account for over a year! I 
glared at the ceiling and tried to 
think things through. 

I came up with a horrible 
thought. 

Marge had always had her 
heart set on a trip to Bermuda. 
Just to get away from it all, she’d 
say. A second honeymoon. 

I got a list of travel agencies 
from the business directory and 
started down them. The third one 
I tried had a pleasant tenor voice. 
“No, sir, not Mrs. Faircloth. You 
bought two tickets. One way. 
Champagne flight to Bermuda.” 

“When?” I choked out. 

“Why, today, as a matter of 
fact. It leaves Idlewild at eleven 
o’clock — ” 

I let him worry about my am- 
nesia and started home fast. I 
didn’t know what they’d given 
that Prime for circuits, but there 
was no question now that he was 
out of control — way out of con- 
trol. And poor Marge, all worked 
up for a second honeymoon — 

Then it struck me. Poor Marge? 
Poor sucker George! No Prime in 
his right circuits would behave 
this way without some human 
guidance and that meant only one 
thing: Marge had spotted him. It 
had happened before. Couple of 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



nasty court battles I’d read about. 
And she’d known all about George 
Prime. 

For how long? 

HEN I got home, the house 
was empty. George Prime 
wasn’t in his closet. And Marge 
wasn’t in the house. 

They were gone. 

I started to call the police, but 
caught myself just in time. I 
couldn’t very well complain to 
the cops that my wife had run 
off with an android. 

Worse yet, I could get twenty 
years for having an illegal Prime 
wandering around. 

I sat down and poured myself 
a stiff drink. 

My own wife deserting me for 
a pile of bearings. 

It was indecent. 

Then I heard the front door 
open and there was Marge, her 
arms full of grocery bundles. 
“Why, darling! You’re home 
early!” 

I just blinked for a moment. 
Then I said, “You’re still here!” 

“Of course. Where did you think 
I’d be?” 

“But I thought — I mean the 
ticket office — ” 

She set down the bundles and 
kissed me and looked up into my 
eyes, almost smiling, half re- 
proachful. “You didn’t really 
think I’d go running off with 
something out of a lab, did you?” 



“Then — you knew?” 

“Certainly I knew, silly. You 
didn’t do a very good job of in- 
structing him, either. You gave 
him far too much latitude. Let 
him have ideas of his own and 
all that. And next thing I knew, 
he was trying to get me to run 
off with him to Hawaii or some- 
place.” 

“Bermuda,” I said. 

And then Marge was in my 
arms, kissing me and snuggling 
her cheek against my chest. 

“Even though he looked like 
you, I knew he couldn’t be,” she 
said. ‘He was like you, but he 
wasn’t you, darling. And all I ever 
want is you. I just never appreci- 
ated you before . .” 

I held her close and tried to 
keep my hands from shaking. 
George Faircloth, Idiot, I thought 
She’d never been more beautiful. 
“But what did you do with him?” 
“I sent him back to the factory, 
naturally. They said they could 
blot him out and use him over 
again. But let’s not talk about 
that any more. We’ve got more 
interesting things to discuss.” 
Maybe we had, but we didn’t 
waste a lot of time talking. It was 
the Marge I’d once known and I 
was beginning to wonder how I 
could have been so wrong about 
her. In fact, unless my memory 
was getting awfully porous, the 
old Marge was never like this — 

I kissed her tenderly and ran 



PRIME DIFFERENCE

my hands through her hair, and 
felt the depression with my fore- 
finger, and then I knew what had 
really happened. 

That Marge always had been 
a sly one. 

I wondered how she was liking 
things in Bermuda. 

M ARGE probably thought 
she’d really put me where I 
belonged, but the laugh was on 
her, after all. 

As I said, the old Marge was 
never like the new one. Marge 
Prime makes Jeree and Sybil and 



Dorothy and Dawn and Jane and 
Ruby all look pretty sad by com- 
parison. 

She cooks like a dream and she 
always brings me my pipe and 
slippers. As they say, there’s noth- 
ing a man likes more than to be 
appreciated. 

A hundred per cent appreci- 
ated, with a factory guarantee to 
correct any slippage, which would 
only be temporary, anyhow. 

One of these days, we’ll take 
that second honeymoon. But I 
think we’ll go to Hawaii.

TRIBES OF THE 
DINOSAURS 

Illustrated by OLGA LEY 

D INOSAURS, said the man, 
were nature’s biggest fail- 
ure. Since I’m always 
ready and willing to learn, I was 
glad to hear this. 

Then I added a few figures in 
my head. The often used term 
Age of Reptiles, during which the 
dinosaurs flourished, comprises 
the three geological periods of the 
Triassic, the Jurassic and the Cre-

taceous. The Triassic and the Ju- 
rassic each lasted about 35 mil- 
lion years and the Cretaceous 
lasted 65 million years. This adds 
up to 135 million years — and you 
really should start counting a few 
million years prior to the Triassic. 

So the “failures” were around 
for at least 140 million years, 
whereas Man started only about 
half a million years ago. I’d say 
that was a remarkably long run 
for a flop and that, so far, at least, 
the critical success has merely 
had an out-of-town tryout. 

However, it is not my intention 
to quarrel with somebody’s wit- 
less verdict. My purpose is, in- 
stead, to discuss the question of 
what the dinosaurs really were, 
since the term is used rather care- 
lessly in newspaper stories, mag- 
azine articles and the movies. To 
begin with the word itself, it was 



pasted together during the last 
century from the two Greek 
words deinos (meaning terrible, 
mighty or powerful) and sauros, 
which just means lizard. 

T HE next statement to be 
made is one that should be 
obvious, but I have found that it 
isn’t — namely, that not every rep- 
tile is a dinosaur, even though all 
dinosaurs were reptiles. Reptiles 
are vertebrate animals which 
have a dry skin, often scaly, 
breathe by means of lungs, prop- 
agate by laying eggs, and lack a 
heat-regulating mechanism, so 
that the temperature of their 
blood is more or less the same as 
the temperature of the surround- 
ing air or water. 

A crocodile is a reptile. So are 
a lizard, a tortoise and a snake. 
But even the largest crocodile, or 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the fiercest-looking iguana, is not 
“an offspring of the dinosaurs” 
You might as well say that an 
especially large bull is “an off- 
spring of the elephants”— both 
these statements are equally silly. 

Nor is the mere fact that a rep- 
tile is now extinct a criterion. The 
eight reptilian forms pictured 
here are absolutely, completely 
and hopelessly extinct, but half 
of them are not dinosaurs. They 
are all reptiles, though, even 
though the word “reptile” comes 
from the Latin repto, which 
means “to crawl.” 

The reptiles got their start way 
back in the Permian Period, a lit- 
tle over 200 million years ago. 



The Earth was not precisely 
“young” any more then; endless 
periods had already gone by since 
its formation. There had been at 
least 2000 million years during 
which the planet was lifeless, then 
another 2000 million years when 
any life that existed was most 
likely single-celled, and another 
600-700 million years with very 
primitive marine life, of which we 
know almost nothing, since they 
left so few fossils. 

Only after all this time had 
passed did paleontological history 
begin with the Cambrian Period, 
which opened the so-called Paleo- 
zoic Era. That era began about 
550 million years ago and lasted

Fig. 3: Compiognathu* longipet, from tho lithographic tlato (late Jurassic) 
of South Germany 



through half a dozen geological 
periods, with a total duration of 
350 million years. 

Those half-dozen periods were 
the Cambrian, then the Ordovi- 
cian, then the Silurian (the oldest 
known fishes belong to this pe- 
riod), followed by the Devonian 
and by the Carboniferous, a pe- 
riod of maximum activity with 
enormous forests which produced 
our coal, and with the earliest 
known insects and salamander- 
like amphibians. 

The last of the geological peri- 
ods of the Paleozoic Era was the 
Permian, which produced the ear- 
liest known reptiles. They are 
known from Texas, from Saxony, 
from Russia (the Permian Period 



received its name from the Rus- 
sian district Perm) and especially 
from South Africa. 

The one that is considered to 
be the grandfather of all the rep- 
tiles was found in Texas and 
named Seymouria. It must have 
looked like a big ill-tempered sal- 
amander with long teeth. In fact, 
Seymouria was not a “complete” 
reptile yet, but is perfectly inter- 
mediate between the early am- 
phibians which came before and 
the reptiles which were still to 
come. 

The Seymouria group, also 
called seymouriamorphs, was, in 
turn, a sub-group of a larger 
group called the cotylosaurs, or, 
in English, the stem reptiles. 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Everything that followed began 
with them. 

A MONG their earliest offshoots 
was a group that goes under 
the technical name of the therap- 
sids, which quickly produced 
rather large plant-eating forms. 
One of the best-known of them is 
Moschops — the name means 
calfs head and don’t ask me why; 
I can’t see any similarity — from 
the Permian of South Africa (Fig. 
1). The clumsy reptile was six 
feet long and must have been 
quite heavy. There were others 
that were even larger and their 
pictures are occasionally printed 
with the caption “early dino- 
saurs” but they were not dino- 
saurs yet. 

Out of this general muddle of 
interrelated large and clumsy, 



small and agile, or even large but 
agile primitive reptiles sprang a 
number of branches that were to 
be fruitful, hence important. 

One of them, called the therio- 
donts (which translates as mam- 
mal teeth) actually did produce 
the mammals in the very next ge- 
ological period, the Triassic. 

Another one moved in direct 
strides toward the lateF cheloni- 
ans, which is the term used by 
zoologists when they wish to en- 
compass both the turtles and the 
tortoises. 

Still another one goes under 
the name of thecodonts. The 
name is compounded of the 
words for tooth and for box, the 
reason being that their teeth had 
roots in separate holes in the 
jaws, an arrangement we tend to 
consider the norm, but which was

(early Jura*«ic) of Sou»h Germany 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



65 



Fig. 5: Holotu* xdontki, from tho oarly Crelaceou* of Meng-Yin-Sion in China 



by no means the norm then. 

This “order” of the thecodonts 
had two sub-orders, called para- 
suchia and pseudosuchia. Trans- 
lated, this gives us near-crocodiles 
and pseudo - crocodiles — of all 
things, the Egyptian name for 
crocodile is hidden in these terms 
— but one should not translate 
here, for they were not related to 
the crocodiles, which are a branch 
of their own. 

The parasuchians at least 
looked somewhat like crocodiles, 
but the pseudosuchians were a 
bunch of radical innovators. Some 
started to climb trees, others ran 
on their hindlegs only, still others 
alternated between bipedal and 
quadrupedal walk. Some were 

66 



armored and others were not 

In time, one sub-branch of the 
versatile pseudosuchians evolved 
into the flying reptiles of the 
Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods 
— the pterosaurs, to use their tech- 
nical name. Another sub-branch 
of the pseudosuchians — not the 
same — learned to fly, too, by 
changing its scales into feathers 
and became the birds. And fur- 
ther sub-branches evolved into 
the dinosaurs. 

A real “early dinosaur” is Pla- 
teosaurus (Fig. 2), of which fine 
specimens have been found in 
Germany, where Plateosaurus ap- 
parently had to migrate across a 
desert area every year, with a few 
falling by the wayside and some 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



of them becoming fossilized. 

Unfortunately the German de- 
posits have yielded fine skeletons 
but no footprints. The reason this 
is regrettable is that we do know 
footprints from Connecticut which 
could have been made by Plateo- 
saurus or a closely related form. 
But in Connecticut, no bones 
have been found. 

Though it had not yet attained 
the impressive dimensions of later 
dinosaurs, Plateosaurus was quite 
big. The length of the tail alone 
was about eight feet. 

HEN paleontology was a 
relatively young science, it 
seemed for a while as if all the 
dinosaurs should or could be 



sorted into two orders which 
could be told apart with half a 
glance, one walking on all fours, 
while the other strutted around 
or. its hindlegs. I am sorry to re- 
port things aren’t that simple. 

There are two orders of dino- 
saurs, all right, but the distin- 
guishing mark is not whether 
they walked on two or four legs. 
The distinguishing mark is the 
shape of the pelvis. 

Very many of them have a pel- 
vis which reminds anatomists of 
the pelvis of birds. They are the 
Order of the Ornithischia and are 
sometimes, for simplicity's sake, 
referred to as the “birdlike” dino- 
saurs. This just proves again that 
we should not translate scientific

terms, for one of these “birdlike” 
dinosaurs is the rhinoceroslike — 
but bigger — Triceratops (Fig. 7). 

On the other hand, little Com- 
psognathus (Fig. 3), which did 
not quite reach the dimensions of 
a domestic cat, is not one of the 
“birdlike” dinosaurs. It belongs to 
the other order, the one which has 
a pelvis like a reptile, the Order 
of the Saurischia. 

Now inside the Order of the 
Saurischia, the old distinction into 
quadrupeds and bipeds does hold 
true. The bipeds are officially the 
Sub-order Theropoda, and Com- 
psognathus is one of them. So is 
the flesh-eating Allosaurus of the 
North American Jurassic and so 
is Tyrannosaurus of the North 
American Cretaceous. 

The second sub-order of the 
Saurischia is the Sub-order Sauro- 
poda, and they are what the lay- 



man usually thinks of when the 
word dinosaur is mentioned. 
Brontosaurus was one of them 
and so was Diplodocus, both from 
the North American Jurassic. An- 
other member was Brachiosaurus 
of eastern Africa, which was prob- 
ably the biggest of the lot, and 
finally the somewhat more recent 
Helotus from China (Fig. 5), 
which was not at all small itself, 
measuring some 65 feet from nos- 
trils to tail tip. The reason Helo- 
tus is pictured grazing at the bot- 
tom of a lake is simply that its 
remains were found in fresh-water 
deposits. 

We now know, because of foot- 
prints found in Texas, that the 
very large sauropod saurischians 
could walk on dry land. This is a 
point worth making since, for 
quite a number of years, it was 
thought that the legs of the sau- 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ropods, while massive, could sup- 
port the body only if shallow 
water helped them to carry it. 
They probably did not go hiking 
for fun, but if they had to cross 
dry land to get from one lake to 
another, they could. 

As I said, the old distinction of 
bipeds on the one hand and quad- 
rupeds on the other hand can still 
be made, provided you stay in- 
side the Order of the Saurischia. 
In the other order of the true 
dinosaurs, the Ornithischia, you 
can do the same, except for one 
main difference. The quadrupeds 
belonging to the Order Ornithi- 
schia are so different from each 
other that they form separate 
sub-orders. 



L ET’S look at this in a little 
more detail. The first sub- 
order of the Ornithischia is that 
of the Ornithopoda (bird-footed). 
In the Jurassic Period, this sub- 
order was represented by the bi- 
pedal dinosaur Camptosaurus, 
which hasn’t received much pub- 
licity in other than professional 
books. But the ornithopods of the 
Cretaceous are well known; they 
are the so-called duck-billed dino- 
saurs, of which Trachodon is the 
favorite example. 

The remaining three sub-orders 
of the Ornithischia are all quad- 
rupeds and they are called Stego- 
sauria, Ankylosauria and Cera- 
topsia. 

The first of these three is rep-

resented, of course, by the well- 
known stegosaur, which bore a 
crest of enormous triangular bony 
plates on its back, with a few 
paired sets of spikes on the tail to 
make the defensive armament 
complete. 

The name stegosaur is based 
on the Greek word for roof — ap- 
parently the first discoverer 
thought that the triangular plates 
were lying flat on the body as 
armor, giving the effect of shin- 
gles. V.’_ now know that they did 
not and it probably was the 
weight of these plates which 
made stegosaur into a quadruped. 
The study of his anatomical fea- 
tures makes it perfectly clear that 
this type was bipedal and re- 
adapted to walking on all four 
legs only after it had already ac- 
quired the features that go with 
a usually upright position. 

The next sub-order, that of the 
Ankylosauria, is not too well 
known to the public and the main 
representative Ankylosaurus is 
not very easy to describe. The 
difficulty begins with the name, 
for the Greek word ankylos can 
mean curved or crooked or else 
stiff-jointed. Both meanings ap- 
ply, the curved to its ribs, the 
stiff-jointed to its general appear- 
ance. It has been called the “tank 
of the Cretaceous Period,” squat 
and heavy in build, with a broad 
armor-plated skull, a heavy stiff 
tail with a clublike bone at the 

70 



tip, and, for all we know, with 
horny spikes along the sides. 

The last sub-order of the Orni- 
thischia was also massive in build 
and heavily armored, at least in 
front. They were the Ceratopsia 
(Fig. 7). 

And there you have the tribes 
of the dinosaurs, all six of them: 
the Theropoda (example: Tyran- 
nosaurus), the Sauropoda (exam- 
ple: Brontosaurus), the Ornitho- 
poda (example: Trachodon, the 
duck-bill), the Stegosauria, the 
Ankylosauria and the Ceratopsia. 
There weren’t any others when 
the dinosaurs were at their peak. 

But how about things like the 
plesiosaurs in the sea, the flying 
saurians in the air? 

They were reptiles and can be 
called saurians, but they were not 
dinosaurs. The ones usually called 
plesiosaurs form a reptilian order 
of their own, the Order Saurop- 
terygia. These long-necked “sea 
serpents” with their four paddles 
became more long-necked as-time 
went on. The plesiosaurus of the 
Jurassic Period was already gi- 
raffe-necked.. What happened in 
the Cretaceous with Elasmosau- 
rus can be seen in Fig. 6. 

11/T ORE numerous than the ple- 
-L"-* siosaurs were another type 
of marine reptiles of the general 
shape and size of a dolphin, the 
ichthyosaurs (Fig. 4). They also 
form a reptilian order of their 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



own, the Order Ichthyosauria, 
from Greek ichthys for fish and 
sauros for lizard. 

How well distributed they were 
can be told by a survey of their 
life history. The earliest known 
types of the ichthyosaurs were 
found mostly in California. A 
somewhat later type, but still 
from the Triassic Period, was 
found in Spitsbergen and named 
Mixosaurus nordenskjoldi, and 
another one of the same age — 
give or take half a million years — 
came to light in Nevada. The vast 
majority of the ichthyosaurs of 
the Jurassic Period, however, is 
concentrated in South Germany 
and South England. 

To forestall questions as to 
why the ichthyosaur of Fig. 4 has 
a different name, I have to ex- 
plain that during the Jurassic Pe- 
riod — more precisely, in the first 
of the three sub-periods of the 
Jurassic Periods, when they were 
most numerous — three main 
types were around in quantities. 
They could be told apart best by 
the shape of their paddles ( pteryx 
in Greek), which were either 
broad ( europs in Greek) or else 
narrow (atenops) or slender (/ep- 
tos ). Hence the three types 
received the designations Europte- 
rygius, Stenopterygius and Lepto- 
pterygius. 

The ichthyosaurs did not con- 
tinue beyond the end of the Ju- 
rassic Period and their last repre- 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



sentatives were weak-looking and 
very nearly toothless types. Ap- 
parently they disappeared be- 
cause they had too much compe- 
tition from other marine reptiles 
which grew large then — with 
teeth to match— and from the 
sharks, which all of a geological 
sudden produced a number of 
formidable types. 

And the flying reptiles? 

They are a separate order, too, 
that of the Pterosauria — that 
Greek word pteryx can mean 
wing as well. We do know that 
nimble tree-climbing pseudosu- 
chians were their ancestors, but 
we can’t tell just when and where 
they put in their first appearance. 
When they did show up, in Euro- 
pean deposits from the Jurassic 
Period, they already came in two 
sharply distinguished types. 

One of these, presumably the 
somewhat^ older, was the ptero- 
dactylus type, with a very short 
tail and usually tiny in size, rang- 
ing from about that of a sparrow 
to that of a pigeon or slightly 
larger. The other was the rham- 
phorhynchus type, which had a 
long tail with a tiny skin rudder 
at its tip and which tended to be 
somewhat larger, about like a 
duck. The pterodactylus type 
seems to have been insect eaters 
(some have rather large eyes, in- 
dicating nocturnal flying) while 
the rhamphorhynchus type prob- 
ably was fish-eating. 

71 



The pterosaurs did produce one 
giant, Pteranodon (Fig. 8), which 
hovered over the Niobrara Sea 
that covered Kansas and adja- 
cent states during the last part of 
the Cretaceous Period. One find 
of Pteranodon has led to the sus- 
picion that its shape may have 
been even more unusual than 
shown. It is possible that it had 
a large throat pouch for pre-di- 
gesting or simply storing fish. The 
experts, so far, only say that this 
is possible and the artists hope 
that they won’t become definite 
on this point, for a dangling 
throat pouch under this head is 
hard to draw convincingly. 

TVrOW, of course, the inevitable 
' question will come up why 
all these abounding forms became 
extinct at the end of the Creta- 
ceous Period. There is no simple 
answer to this question because 
there was no single cause for the 
extinction of the dinosaurs and 
those other reptile tribes. 

Let’s turn this around first and 
see what is left of the Class of the 
Reptilia. The following is a list- 
ing of all the orders — at this 
point, I have the choice of either 
following the system of the late 
Professor Othenio Abel of Vienna 
University, or that of Professor 
Baron von Huene of Tubingen 
University, or that of Professor 
Alfred Sherwood Romer of Har- 
vard University, and I have de- 



cided in favor of Harvard — with 

notes pertaining to their fates. 

Order COTYLOSAURIA, the 
stem reptiles, extinct even 
before the days of the dino- 
saurs. 

Order CHELONIA, tortoises and 
turtles, still with us. 

Order ICHTHYOSAURIA, ex- 
tinct since end of the Juras- 
sic Period. 

Order SAUROPTERYGIA, ple- 
siosaurs, extinct since end of 
Cretaceous Period. 

Order EOSUCHIA, ancient rep- 
tiles, extinct at an early date. 

Order RHYNCHOCEPHALIA, 
another type of ancient rep- 
tiles, most of them extinct at 
an early date, but one, Hat- 
teria, still alive on islets near 
New Zealand. 

Order SQUAMATA, which has 
two sub-orders, the LACER- 
TILIA or lizards and the 
OPHIDIA or snakes, both 
still with us; the snakes are 
the most recent reptilian 
type to have evolved. 

Order THECODONTIA, ancient 
reptiles, as explained, extinct. 

Order CROCODILIA, crocodiles 
and alligators, still with us; 
they don’t date back past the 
Jurassic Period. 

Order PTEROSAURIA, flying 
reptiles, lasted only through 
Jurassic and Cretaceous. 

Order SAURISCHIA, dinosaurs, 



72 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



two sub-orders, extinct. 
Order ORNITHISCHIA, dino- 
saurs, four sub-orders, ex- 
tinct. 

Order PELYCOSAURIA, very 
early forms, extinct. 

Order THERAPSIDA, very early 
and somewhat mammal-like 
forms, extinct, but the mam- 
mals sprang from one of 
these last two orders. 

Though the glory of the rep- 
tiles is gone, there are still plenty 
of reptilians left. As for those that 
vanished, one can figure out the 
reasons in a few cases, though not 
for all. But it must be kept in 
mind that saying “they became 
extinct at the end of the Creta- 
ceous Period” is putting it very 
vaguely indeed. That statement 
still leaves a leeway of a few 
million years, and after all dino- 
saurs had been extinct on Conti- 
nent A, they might still have been 
thriving on Continent B. 

The reasons? A large forest 
fire, set by lightning, could easily 
wipe out a tribe of pterosaurs. 
The ichthyosaurs succumbed to 



competition after they, presum- 
ably adapting to a diet of squid, 
had shed their own teeth. Many 
tribes, especially when living on 
small continents or very large is- 
lands, could have been eradicated 
by egg-eaters. Small mammals 
like eggs and so do birds — and 
so do snakes, the last offspring of 
the reptiles themselves. 

The large forms probably suc- 
cumbed to fairly minor climatic 
changes, simply because they 
were large. Reptiles lack sweat 
glands and die of heat stroke if 
the sun is hot and no water and 
shade are available. A minor 
earthquake resulting in the drain- 
ing of a few sets of large shallow 
lakes would indirectly kill off 
whole armies of sauropods. A 
small lizard can shade itself in 
underbrush or in cracks between 
rocks; a brontosaurus could not 

But even though the tribes are 
all gone, I can’t get myself to 
label them failures. For they did

interest of one whose chief article 
of diet was oil.

President Buchbinder said. “Go iM

It wasn't possible to make a bigger or more 
disastrous blunder . expecting an alien to 
consider himself yr humble & obdt servantl 



voice subsided to a groan. “Have 
the people no respect for our 
sacred traditions? Don’t they know 
the White House lawn is the only 
place for miles around where peas 
will grow?” 

THE HARDEST BARGAIN 



“They’re young, most of them,” 
Dr. Livingston, the President’s 
confidential advisor, said tolerant- 
ly, puffing at his pipe. “The way 
the birth rate’s been climbing, you 
take any given number of the 

75 



population at any one time and 
the majority will be too young 
to remember our glorious tradi- 
tions — ” 

“Their parents could teach 
them!” Buchbinder snapped. “Af- 
ter all, isn’t that why we have 
parents instead of incubators?" 

“Their parents are too busy 
scratching out a living and — ah — 
breeding to be able to instruct the 
young ones,” Livingston said. “It’s 
a vicious circle which has come 
to a head in this generation.” 

There was something wrong 
with that statement, Buchbinder 
knew, but he didn’t dare come 
right out and say so, for fear of 
looking a fool. He knew his con- 
fidential advisor was smarter than 
he was. And what with the atomic 
wars of the past couple of centu- 
ries, the large proportion of stron- 
tium 90 in the atmosphere, and 
general intellectual jealousy, there 
weren’t many intelligent people 
left in the world, so the ones that 
remained had to be handled with 
care. 

B uchbinder turned to 

Z-1313A, who was still stand- 
ing there. “Why haven’t you 
obeyed my instructions?” he de- 
manded, outraged at this evidence 
of insubordination in a robot. 
From people you expected it, but 
a machine was supposed to be 
above such petty defectiveness. 
“Why don’t you go chase the 



rioters off the lawn, per order?” 

“I don’t dare, sir,” Z-1313A ex- 
plained. “Should I get close 
enough, they would disassemble 
me. As a matter of fact, when I 
informed them from the balcony 
that they were trespassing, they 
employed language which — well, 
sir, if I hadn’t been a robot and 
constitutionally incapable of the 
pudent graces, it would have 
made me blush.” 

“Disassemble a robot!” Buch- 
binder repeated, shocked. “I never 
heard of anything so manic in my 
life. Why should they want to do 
a thing like that?” 

Since the robot did not have 
parts sufficiently flexible for 
shrugging, he remained impassive. 
It was Dr. Livingston who an- 
swered. “Haven’t you heard, Will? 
The people are starting to destroy 
robots when they can get then- 
hands on them. To try to destroy 
them, that is. Fortunately, most 
of the people are too weak from 
hunger and racial debility to do 
any great damage unless they op- 
erate in gangs. Looks like you’ll 
have to pass an anti-congregation 
law.” 

“But why should they want to 
do a silly thing like destroying 
robots?” Buchbinder persisted. 

Livingston smiled wisely. 
“They’re saying that if it weren’t 
for the robots, they’d have jobs, 
a higher standard of living — the 
usual complaints you hear at the 



76 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



beginning of every revolution” 

“If it weren’t for the robots, 
they wouldn’t have anything at 
all!” Buchbinder said, exasper- 
ated. “Don’t they realize that the 
only thing that keeps the country 
going at all is the fact that there’s 
a plentiful supply of free labor? 
And I understand from Counter- 
intelligence that it’s the same 
overseas.” 

“Oh, there’s plenty of free la- 
bor,” Livingston observed. “Plenty 
of service, too. But very little to 
eat.” 

“That’s not true,” Buchbinder 
said hotly. “Maybe hydroponics 
didn’t work out for large-scale 
operations; still, the people could 
perfectly well eat synthetics. But, 
no, they’re so stubborn, they’d 
rather starve to death — ” 

“Some of them did eat the syn- 
thetics and died anyway.” 

“Some people insist on being 
allergic to anything! It’s all in the 
mind!” At times like this, Buch- 
binder felt he was on the verge 
of going mad, like Presidents Ling 
and Riccobono before him. If 
only he had been elected in the 
days before the atomic wars, when 
it was a treat to be President! 
Then, all a Chief Executive had 
to do were fun things, like ap- 
pointing ambassadors and making 
speeches and declaring wars. He 
didn’t have to worry how to feed 
the people; in those days, there 
used to be food growing all over 

THE HARDEST BARGAIN 



the place and it was distributed 
with such efficiency that only a 
small portion of the populace ever 
went hungry. 

“You’d think since they know 
there isn’t much food,” Buch- 
binder said, “that people wouldn’t 
have quite so many children and 
make more mouths to feed.” 

“I don’t suppose they’re doing 
it consciously,” Livingston told 
him. “It’s nature’s attempt to en- 
sure the survival of the race. And 
it certainly looks from here as if 
it’s likely to be a futile one.” 

“You’re always so pessimistic, 
Maurice.” 

Dr. Livingston cleared his 
throat, as he always did before 
making a remark he felt to be 
especially apt. “The thinking 
man,” he said, “is the despairing 
man.” 

TJOBOT Z-1313B came into the 
President’s office. “A ship 
from outer space has landed on 
the lawn, sir,” he announced, 
“thus, I am sure you will be grati- 
fied to know, effectively disposing 
of the rioters.” 

“Oh, good!” Robot Z-1313A 
said. “That disposes of my prob- 
lem.” 

Both robots shook hands with 
a slight grating noise. 

“But if there were any peas 
left,” Buchbinder mourned, “this 
must have finished them.” 

However, he arose, for when 

77 



duty summoned, Willis Buchbin- 
der, though possibly reluctant, 
was never remiss. 

“I don’t see why the star traders 
keep on coming all the way out 
here,” he remarked as he put on 
the sacred frock coat with the 
authentic moth holes. “Surely 
what little we have to trade 
wouldn’t be of much value to 
them.” 

Livingston took his pipe out of 
his mouth. “I imagine there must 
always be little novelty items 
they can pick up. After all, the 
fact that we’re so far off the 
beaten track probably gives our 
products some curio value, if 
nothing else.” 

“Oh, I suppose so,” Buchbinder 
sighed. “All right, activate the 
reception committee,” he told 
Z-1313B. “I don’t suppose there’s 
any chance this could be a diplo- 
matic mission or anything like 
that?” he added wistfully, brush- 
ing off the tall genuine silk cere- 
monial hat. 

“No, sir, it is merely a trading 
ship — and rather a small one,” 
said Z-1313B, who left to turn on 
the reception committee. That 
was merely a fancy name for a 
unitranslator which the govern- 
ment had purchased from a Dene- 
bian trader some decades before 
in return for a partridge in a pear 
tree. The bargain had, of course, 
been closed in the days when 
neither partridges nor pear trees 

78 



had become obsolescent. 

Although interstellar traders 
had been dropping in on Earth 
for the past, hundred years or so, 
Earth had no diplomatic relations 
with the other solar systems — or 
any kind of official relations at 
all, in fact. As far as the terres- 
trials could make out from the 
information given them by the 
various life-forms who hit Earth 
from time to time those days, 
there had been some kind of 
embargo on their planet for many 
centuries. If the more extrava- 
gant reports were to be believed, 
the sanctions dated back to the 
time when there were no powered 
vehicles on Earth. 

At any rate, as a result of these 
discriminatory tactics, Earth citi- 
zens were not allowed to ride in 
the extraterrestrial ships back to 
their point of origin. It was very 
likely that an attempt would have 
been made to prevent them from 
traveling in their own ships, if 
they’d had any. Fortunately, how- 
ever, Earth had not succeeded in 
developing space travel and so 
the question never arose. 

“Used to be an embargo on all 
trade, even,” a chatty Aldebaran- 
ian octopoid had told President 
Ling. “Now the League seems to 
be easing up a little on non-vital 
materials. Who knows, maybe 
someday, when you’re advanced 
enough or something, they’ll even 
let you into the League. Now 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



what do you have to offer in fine 
glass and crystal?” 

WTF WE didn’t need food,” 
Buchbinder declared, “I 
wouldn’t speak to one of those 
outworlders. If we’re not good 
enough for them, I don’t see 
why — ” 

“But we do need food,” Living- 
ston said, taking his pipe out of 
his mouth and pointing it at the 
President. “Desperately. You have 
no choice but to dicker with him.” 

Buchbinder nodded gloomily. 

“On the other hand, Will, do 
you think it dignified to go drive 
the bargain yourself? What do 
you have a Secretary of the Inte- 
rior for?” 

“St. Clair?” Buchbinder cried 
contemptuously. “Why, I wouldn’t 
trust him as far as I could spit. 
Less, in fact, because I used to be 
the champion — ” 

“Willis, Willis,” Livingston 
chided gently as he, too, pulled on 
his frock coat, “this is no time for 
dithering.” 

“If that St. Clair saw a chance 
to make a fast buck for himself,” 
Buchbinder grumbled, “he 
wouldn’t give a damn about the 
country. Besides, if there happen 
to be any truffles, I want to put 
my bid in for them first. The last 
time, Defense got them all. And 
when I reminded General Mc- 
Mullen that, after all, I was Com- 
mander-in-Chief, he said he was 



sorry, but the top brass had al- 
ready eaten them all in a souffle. 

“Have you ever thought, Mau- 
rice,” Buchbinder continued as, 
fully attired in the traditional 
ceremonial garments, the two dig- 
nitaries clattered down the grand 
stairs, “how funny it is that these 
extraterrestrial fellows should 
have the exact kind of food we 
eat? I mean it’s obvious that 
they’re completely different life- 
forms with different digestive sys- 
tems and everything. Some aren’t 
even animals and yet they bring 
— well, oats, peas, beans and bar- 
ley. Earth food.” 

“It’s obvious they must know 
a great deal about us,” Livingston 
answered. “We are worth a bit of 
study. So it’s not hard to under- 
stand — ” 

“I’m not asking how they know 
what we eat,” Buchbinder said. 
“I’m asking where they get it 
from. And all properly put up in 
cans, too.” 

“It doesn’t take a great deal of 
know-how to put up food in cans. 
Posnack’s experiments with chim- 
panzees conclusively — ” 

“I didn’t mean — ” Buchbinder 
interrupted. Then he forgot what 
he was starting to say as he 
tripped over a roller skate on the 
bottom step. “Even here,” he said 
bitterly. “In the White House. 
Children.” 

“Must be the Secretary of Agri- 
culture’s twins,” Livingston said. 



THE HARDEST BARGAIN

“He brings them to work to save 
the cost of a baby-sitter.” 

HPHE reception committee 
proved to be unnecessary; the 
trader spoke fluent English. He 
was also vaguely humanoid, being 
a biped with only one pair of 
arms and one — rather small — 
head. It was in skin coloring that 
the difference between him and 
the human was most marked, not 
so much in hue as in arrange- 
ment, for his complexion ranged 
from the ruddy bronze of the 
American Indian on one side of 
his scantily clothed body to a 
Mongolian ochre on the other. 
Had he been portly rather than 
thin, he would have resembled an 
apple. His name was Foma and 
he came from the Fomalhaut sys- 
tem. 

Foma was one of the most at- 
tractive outworlders Buchbinder 
had ever seen, although the Presi- 
dent’s favorable opinion was un- 
doubtedly influenced by the fact 
that the alien had not only 
brought cans of truffles but sauer- 
kraut and pate de fois gras and 
beer as well. There were herrings 
and jam and jellybeans put up in 
clear, shining glass jars, and 
lovely plump knockwursts and 
Brunschweiger sausages neatly 
encased in their own skins. He 
had plastic bags of pretzels and 
potatoes, and his frozen-food 
locker actually contained stewed 



rabbit and pumpernickel and 
three kinds of strudel. 

Foma drove a hard bargain, for 
he wanted a considerable quan- 
tity of Revere silver in return for 
all these delightful things. How- 
ever, Buchbinder was no slouch 
at haggling, either, and he man- 
aged to beat down the alien two 
teapots and a creamer before the 
bargain was closed. 

Then the robots swiftly carried 
the crates of food into the White 
House, where a certain portion 
would be reserved for the govern- 
ment tables. The rest would be 
carried by other robots to Fort 
Knox, from which it would be 
dispensed to the general popula- 
tion according to merit, rank and 
connections. And, as the food was 
taken out of the ship, the crowd 
of children outside the fence, who 
had been emitting shrill jeers and 
catcalls throughout the prelim- 
inary parleying, fell silent and 
reverent before the almost leg- 
endary dainties borne past them. 

“Nice little machines you have 
there,” Foma said, surveying the 
robots appreciatively. “Is there 
any chance that you would con- 
sider parting with some? I’ll give 
you a good price.” 

“Oh, no, decidedly not!” the 
President exclaimed, horrified at 
such a suggestion. “These were 
the last creations of our greatest 
minds before they died,” he ex- 
plained, “and our economy, such 



80 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



as it is, is founded upon them. We 
couldn’t do without our robots. 
And there’s an arbitrary limit on 
their numbers built in as one of 
the prime directives. They manu- 
facture themselves, you see,” he 
went on, anxious not to offend the 
outworlder, “which is why we 
have none available for export” 

“I do see,” Foma said with a 
smile. “What I can’t understand, 
though, is how you people man- 
aged to survive with an economy 
based on food that doesn’t seem 
to be indigenous to your planet.” 

“Oh, but it used to be,” the 
President replied wistfully. 

¥TE MADE a sweeping gesture 
■*■■■■ that embraced all of the Dis- 
trict of Columbia and part of 
Maryland. “Once, verdant vegeta- 
tion stretched as far as the eye 
could see, while edible animals 
gamboled about blissfully in it. 
Why,” he cried, carried away, 
“prior to the twenty-first century, 
the whole country looked like a 
combined zoological and botani- 
cal garden.” 

“It must have been very pret- 
ty,” Foma said. “Not that it isn’t 
pretty now,” he added with polite 
haste. “A very pleasant spot. A 
river does so much for a town, 
and that’s a very charming river 
washing the southern side—” 

“The western side,” Livingston 
corrected him thoughtfully. “If 
you mean the Potomac.” 



“The southwestern side, to be 
exact,” the President said, exer- 
cising diplomacy. “However, you 
should have seen the place before 
the wars. I understand it was a 
veritable fairyland!” He grew sad. 
“But then came the wars. Most 
of the land was devastated by 
those terrible nuclear weapons, 
except for small patches here and 
there left fertile by chance. The 
scientists say nothing will grow 
on most of it for hundreds of 
years, by which time the race will 
have died out, I suppose.” He 
gave a brave smile. “Ah, well, it 
was fun while it lasted.” 

“I don’t mean to presume,” 
Foma said, “but I suppose you 
could derive a little moral les- 
son from what happened: to wit, 
fighting is unprofitable as well as 
unethical.” 

“Oh, the human being has al- 
ways been a fighting animal,” Dr. 
Livingston replied. “If you must 
have a moral, it might be — ” he 
cleared his throat — “If your 
weapons are too good, you’ll kill 
off all the game.” 

Foma gave the confidential ad- 
visor a chilling stare, then turned 
back to Buchbinder. “I am begin- 
ning to understand now why you 
don’t rehabilitate your land and 
start growing things again. I had 
wondered, but I see now you real- 
ize that the same thing would 
only happen all over again, so it’s 
no use. I really admire you, 



THE HARDEST BARGAIN 



81 



though, for your national strength 
of character in—” 

“Rehabilitate the land?” Buch- 
binder repeated incredulously. 
“You mean the radioactivity can 
be removed from the soil?” 
“Hasn’t anyone ever told you?” 
Foma asked. “Wait a minute, 
though,” he added consideringly. 
“I might be treading on classified 
ground. I must consult my hand- 
book.” 

Placing what looked like a spe- 
cies of optical instrument before 
his face, he twirled several knobs. 

“No,” he announced as he re- 
moved it, “not classified at all. I’m 
forced to the shocking conclusion 
that the other traders didn’t want 
to dry up a profitable source of 
revenue by decontaminating your 
land.” 

“Well, even if such a process 
were possible,” Livingston said, 
“you can hardly blame them. 
After all, business is business.” 
Foma looked at him sternly. 

T HESE philosophical irrele- 
vancies made the President 
impatient. “Do you mean you 
have a way of removing the ra- 
dioactivity — ” 

“Watch out,” Livingston whis- 
pered. “This looks like the be- 
ginning of a sharp practice to me. 
Personally, I don’t believe there 
is any such process.” 

Apparently the outworlder’s 
hearing was more acute than the 

82 



human. “You Earth people are so 
suspicious. No wonder — ” And 
then he stopped. 

“No wonder what?” Livingston 
pressed. 

“Just no wonder,” Foma said 
firmly. He turned to the Presi- 
dent. “Would you like your land 
decontaminated? By good for- 
tune, I do happen to 'have the 
requisite equipment for taking the 
radioactivity out of soil. The 
same machine is used for many 
things.” 

“Aha!” Dr. Livingston cried. 
“Good fortune, indeed!” He 
cleared his throat. “The coinci- 
dence in the natural state is an 
extremely rare bird.” 

“I’m not denying that it is 
rather an expensive process,” 
Foma continued, ignoring him. 
“But when you need something 
done, you’ve got to pay the — the 
price.” 

It was pretty depressing, Buch- 
binder thought, to know that 
there was a cure for your ailment 
and not have the money to pay 
for the medicine. 

“We have so little,” he said 
hopelessly. “So very little. What 
can we offer that will make it 
worth your while?” 

“You underestimate the value 
of your native handicrafts,” Foma 
smiled. “I will undertake to re- 
move the radioactivity from the 
entire country,” he offered, chang- 
ing to a brisk, businesslike tone, 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“in return for the following . ” 
Putting his optical instrument to 
his eye again, he read aloud: 
“Rembrandt, Old Woman Cutting 
Her Nails; El Greco, View of To- 
ledo; Titian, Venus and Adonis; 
Daumier, Third-class Carriage; 
Goya, Don Manuel Osorio; Ce- 
zanne, Card Players; and Picasso, 
The Three Musicians.” 

“What’s all that in English?” 
Buchbinder asked, thinking that 
Foma, in his enthusiasm, had 
lapsed into his native tongue. 
“Are you sure we have it?” 

“He was speaking English,” 
Livingston hissed. “Those are pic- 
tures, famous paintings. Among 
the nation’s most treasured artis- 
tic possessions. We can hardly sell 
them for — ” he gave a bitter little 
laugh —“food.” 

“You mean better we should 
starve than sell them?" Buchbin- 
der asked. 

“Better we should starve,” Liv- 
ingston said solemnly. 

T HE President struggled hard 
to understand. “But we sold 
him the teapots and they’re his- 
torical. They were made by Paul 
Revere and he — ” 

“I know all about Paul Revere, 
thank you,” Livingston said. 

“And these are just pictures. 
From the way they sounded, they 
were all painted by foreigners. 
And Paul Revere was an Ameri- 
can. A patriot — ” 

THE HARDEST BARGAIN 



“I know, I know,” Livingston 
interrupted. “On the twenty-sec- 
ond of July in ’seventy-six — ” 
“Now even I know better than 
that,” Buchbinder said, staring at 
him in amazement, as did the 
alien. “It’s ‘On the eighteenth of 
April in ’seventy-five . .’” 

“Of course,” Livingston mur- 
mured. “Now why did my sub- 
conscious make me get the date 
wrong like that?” 

“Human memory is fallible," 
Foma suggested suavely. 

The President tugged insistent- 
ly at Livingston’s sleeve. “You’re 
willing to sell the teapots of this 
great American patriot, but when 
it comes to things that were made 
by foreigners — ” 

“You simply don’t understand, 
Willis.” 

“I know I don’t.” Buchbinder’s 
voice was plaintive. “That’s why 
I’m asking you to explain it to 
me.” 

“Paul Revere was a great man 
and a fine silversmith. It is a pity 
to let his creations go out of our 
solar system. However — ” Living- 
ston cleared his throat — “purely 
utilitarian objects never attain 
the artistic dignity of beauty cre- 
ated for its own sake.” 

“Why?” the President wanted 
to know. 

Livingston gave a sigh and 
turned to the outworlder. “Look, 
Mr. — ah — Foma, I’m afraid it 
will require a special session of 

83 




Congress to settle this matter. 
Would you mind waiting a few 
weeks? Or months?” 

“Or, possibly, years,” the Presi- 
dent grumbled. 

“Not at all,” Foma said, smil- 
ing. “I shall amuse myself by 
browsing through the Congres- 
sional Library. Perhaps I can lo- 
cate one or two little items there 
that we can make a deal on.” 

B OTH houses of Congress 
tended to support the Presi- 
dent’s point of view. “For,” the 
Senate majority leader orated, 
“splendid and enduring monu- 
ments to our nation’s greatness 
though these works of art may 
be — ” 

“They weren’t even painted by 
Americans,” Buchbinder inter- 
posed helpfully. 

The majority leader glared at 
him. “I didn’t say they were 
splendid and enduring monu- 
ments to our nation’s greatness. I 
only said they may be. Anyhow, 
should the race perish, there will 
be no one to look at these beauti- 
ful pictures and appreciate their 
— er — beauty. But then again, 
should we entrust them to the 
keeping of the gentleman from 
the stars — ” he bowed toward 
Foma — “I am sure that his people 
will preserve them with the same 
loving care and solicitude that we 
ourselves have given them.” 

“You may rest assured of that,” 

84 



Foma promised, returning the 
bow. 

“Then, when our lands are 
fruitful once more, when we are 
able to give of their abundance 
to our four-footed friends, so that 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





the animal kingdom may thrive 
and multiply again, when our 
race has regained its former 
glory, invigorated by the renewal 
of plenty and a reliable supply of 
meat, we shall develop space 



travel of our own. A mighty fleet 
shall set sail for the stars — ” 
“Hear, hear!” shrieked the chil- 
dren who filled the gallery to 
bursting.

85 



holds where the pictures are kept 
close,” the Senator continued, 
“and then we — ” he glanced at 
Foma and seemed to recollect 
himself —“and then we will look 
at them.” 

There were boos and catcalls 
from the gallery. 

“Silence!” bellowed the Con- 
gressional robots. “Si-lence!” 

“But who’s to say this alleged 
process will work?” the minority 
leader asked. President Buch- 
binder knew he was a close asso- 
ciate of Dr. Livingston’s. “Mr. 
Foma may make off with our 
paintings and leave the land as 
barren as ever.” 

“Naturally, I shall not ask for 
payment, gentlemen,” Foma said, 
“until your lands are green once 
more.” 

“Well,” the minority leader 
concluded lamely, “nothing can 
be fairer than that. I guess.” 

That seemed to settle it. Con- 
gress passed an act empowering 
the alien to commence rehabili- 
tating the barren lands. Dr. Liv- 
ingston remained in Washington 
to keep the eternal light burning 
over the Tombs of the numerous 
Unknown Soldiers, while Foma 
and President Buchbinder set off 
for Smith County, Kansas. Smith 
County, Kansas, was the geo- 
graphical center of the United 
States and hence the place where 
Foma proposed to set up his 
equipment. 



?CT'|OESN’T seem like much,” 
Buchbinder observed as 
Foma, with the efficient aid of 
some of the Smith County robots, 
put together a simple contraption 
of wheels, springs, pipes, valves, 
relays, switches, coils, shafts and 
wires. 

“Perhaps not,” Foma said af- 
fably, “but it is highly effective. 
When activated, the machine dis- 
seminates powerful sonic rays 
which will accelerate the diminu- 
tion of the half-life of the soil 
until, in very short order, it be- 
comes only a quarter-life, then an 
eighth-life, a sixteenth-life — ” 

“I understand,” the President 
interrupted. “But how long does 
it take until there is no life at 
all — no radioactive life, that is?” 
“Perhaps a week, Foma said. 
“Perhaps eight days, perhaps six.” 
“I’d also like to know,” the 
President inquired, apprehensive- 
ly buttoning his jacket up to his 
throat, “whether it does anything 
to people. Because it’s not much 
good if the soil turns fertile and 
we turn the opposite.” 

“At this setting,” Foma said, “it 
has not the slightest effect upon 
any form of animal life.” 

He beamed upon the Smith 
County children who had gath- 
ered to watch the proceedings. 
They stuck out their tongues at 
him. Buchbinder hoped that wher- 
ever the alien came from, it was 
a gesture of great respect. 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Then the President had a 
frightening thought “The emana- 
tions won’t'reach the Eastern Em- 
pire, will they? We wouldn’t 
want their soil to become fertile 
again.” 

“You are paying to have this 
country decontaminated,” Foma 
said, “and only this country will 
be decontaminated. I do not offer 
my services gratis. People set no 
value on anything for which they 
do not pay.” 

“Well, of course not!” President 
Buchbinder agreed. Then he had 
an even more appalling idea. The 
Eastern Empire, he’d been given 
to understand, had some art treas- 
ures of its own in a place called 
the Hermitage. “After you’ve fin- 
ished with us,” he asked, “you’re 
not going to turn around and 
make a deal with the East to de- 
contaminate them, are you?” 

“That,” Foma said curtly as he 
blew into one of the pipes, “is my 
business.” 

“Oh, dear,” the President 
thought, “it is going to mean more 
wars. Well,” he consoled himself, 
“war is more interesting than 
riots and, as a matter of fact, a 
lot safer for me personally, since 
rioters always make for the White 
House first, whereas war is on a 
more catch-as-catch-can basis.” 

A T THE end of a week, Foma 
reported that the machine’s 
work was done and dismantled it. 

THE HARDEST BARGAIN 



President Buchbinder was thank- 
ful, for the sonic vibrations were 
nerve-racking and people had 
been complaining, even though he 
had made a video address to the 
nation beforehand to explain just 
what they were supposed to do. 
Now he made another address, 
exhorting everyone who had any 
ground at all to go forth and 
plant seeds. 

“And in case the seeds we have 
should not prove viable,” he con- 
cluded, “Mr. Foma has been kind 
enough to throw a group of vege- 
table seeds from his own stock 
into the bargain. Do not think, 
however,” he reassured the na- 
tion, “that these are the seeds of 
alien vegetation. On the contrary, 
we have Swiss chard, cabbage, 
beets, onions, cucumbers, Brussels 
sprouts and rhubarb — all per- 
fectly familiar, I may even say 
beloved, native vegetables.” 

As they went off the air, the 
President remembered a question 
that had been bothering him ear- 
lier. 

“You don’t look like us,” he 
said to Foma. “How come you 
grow exactly the same vegetables 
as we used to?” 

“A trader must have brought 
some seeds back from this planet,” 
Foma said. “Must have been a 
long time ago, too, because the 
vegetables you describe as yours 
flourish on a good many of the 
other worlds now. Although we 

87 



don’t care for the produce our- 
selves, some of our pets like them, 
which is why we happened to 
have supplies on hand when we 
reopened trading operations with 
you.” 

“Oh,” the President said. It 
sounded reasonable enough. 

After the broadcast, Foma and 
President Buchbinder returned to 
Washington, where Foma reveled 
in the pleasures of the Congres- 
sional Library and the Folger 
Memorial for some weeks. Then 
the seeds, both local and im- 
ported, began to sprout and the 
land turned green, according to 
promise, and Foma’s bill came 
due. 

Wj|f FOMA of Fomalhaut to 

-L"-* see you,” Robot X-1313B 
announced as he came into the 
President’s office, where Buch- 
binder and Livingston were play- 
ing chess. 

“Sorry I couldn’t wait to have 
an appointment put through the 
regular channels,” Foma said, 
coming in hard upon the robot’s 
heels. 

“Oh, my dear fellow,” said 
Buchbinder, rising, “think nothing 
of it — we are very informal here. 
What can I do for you?” 

“Now that my part of the bar- 
gain is fulfilled, I’m rather anx- 
ious to go home, so I’d appreciate 
immediate payment of my bill.” 

“Of course, of course! I’ll start 

88 



getting the pictures together. You 
should have them by the end of 
the week.” 

“Excellent.” The alien smiled. 
“Meanwhile, I’ll get my ship 
ready for the return journey.” He 
shook hands with Buchbinder and 
left. 

“You won’t have to bother get- 
ting the pictures together,” Dr. 
Livingston said as soon as Foma 
had gone. “They’re all in the base- 
ment already.” 

“Maurice,” the President said 
feelingly, “you did this for me 
while I was gone. You put aside 
your personal prejudices in order 
to save me trouble. You — ” 

“Well,” Livingston interrupted 
uncomfortably, “you might as 
well know now: they’re not ex- 
actly the same pictures he asked 
for. While you were gone, I got 
together with a little Congres- 
sional committee and we de- 
cided — ” 

“But we promised!” Buchbinder 
exclaimed in dismay. “We agreed 
on seven specific pictures. They’re 
listed right here on the bill he 
rendered!” 

“We didn’t sign a contract,” 
Livingston said, pushing away the 
paper the President was thrust- 
ing in his face. “Besides, he is get- 
ting pictures. Masterpieces, too. 
But more the kind his people will 
be able to appreciate.” 

“How do you know that?” 

“Look, I’ll show them to you.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



V\R. LIVINGSTON led the 
President down to the base- 
ment. “Here’s what Foma’s get- 
ting,” he explained. “Instead of 
Rembrandt’s Old Woman Cutting 
Her Nails, we give him Delacroix’s 
Arab T ax Collector. Instead of El 
Greco’s View of Toledo, he gets 
Constable’s Wivenhoe Park, Es- 
sex. For Titian’s Venus and 
Adonis, Hals’ Junker Ramp and 
His Sweetheart. For Daumier’s 
Third-Class Carriage, Eastmans 
My Old Kentucky Home. For 
Goya’s Don Manuel Osorio, Cana- 
letto’s Vegetable Garden. For Ce- 
zanne’s Card Players, Fragonard’s 
A Game of Hot Cockles. And for 
Picasso’s Three Musicians, Mu- 
rillo’s Jacob and Rachel at the 
Well.” 

“Yes, they are very pretty pic- 
tures,” the President said, inspect- 
ing them. “Very pretty, indeed. I 
can see how we’d hate to let them 
go” 

“No, no, no!” Livingston cried. 
“These are the ones we’re giving 
him! Nothing but the best, you 
see. And, on the average, much 
larger than the ones he asked for. 
Why, he might not even have 
known about these; they are less 
publicized, so outworlders might 
not have heard of them.” 

“That’s very considerate of you, 
Maurice,” the President said, “but 
since we are giving him master- 
pieces, anyway, why don’t we let 
him have the ones he asked for? 



Why go to all this trouble?” 

“I’ll tell you, Will,” said Liv- 
ingston. “It’s because the nation 
has more of a sentimental attach- 
ment to the others. And, further- 
more, the pictures we are giving 
him present a more favorable 
view of terrestrial life. The others 
— well, I hate to say it about mas- 
terpieces, Willis, but some of 
them might almost be considered 
sordid. And one of these was 
painted by an American.” 

“These are nice.” The Presi- 
dent didn’t know much about art, 
but he didn’t see how anybody 
could help liking the pictures Liv- 
ingston and the Congressional 
committee had selected. “Very 
nice.” 

“That’s just it, Will!” Livings- 
ton clapped him on the shoulder. 
“You’ve hit it exactly. They’re 
nice! They’re the kind of pictures 
we’d be proud to have another 
world see. We want to make a 
good impression in the other solar 
systems, don’t we, so someday 
maybe we can get into the Big 
League ourselves?” 

He was convincing, but Bucfy- 
binder was still dubious. “Are you 
sure Foma will understand? He 
might make a fuss. And he has 
every right to, you know.” 

“We’ll get the robots to do 
these up in special gift-wrapping 
paper,” Livingston said, “with rib- 
bons and seals and all, and maybe 
Foma won’t open them until he 



THE HARDEST BARGAIN 



gets to his home planet.” 

“Maybe,” the President half 
agreed. “But even if he doesn’t 
open them, somehow it doesn’t 
seem right. Maurice, don’t you 
think we’re going to sacrifice a 
lot of interstellar good-will if we 
pull a trick like this?” 

“Nonsense! It’s just sound busi- 
ness practice.” Livingston cleared 
his throat. “Besides, we cannot let 
mere material considerations in- 
terfere with our duty.” 



“I suppose not,” the President 
said. “On the other hand—” 

“I’ll call the robots and have 
them start wrapping right away,” 
Livingston told him. 

jT>UT these aren’t the pictures 
Mr. Foma asked for,” 
Z-1313A said helpfully as he 
brought out the big roll of gold- 
foil gift-wrapping paper, with 
“Compliments of the White 
House,” “Regards from the Presi- 




90 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




dent,” and “Best Wishes from the 
U.S.A.” etched on it in flowing 
script. “Someone apparently has 
blundered. Shall we — ” 

“There’s no mistake,” the Presi- 
dent said, the more impatiently as 
he could not, in spite of Dr. Liv- 
ingston’s assurances, get his con- 
science to accept this switching 
of art works. 

“They don’t look to me like 
pictures anybody would ask for,” 
Z-1313B contributed. 




THE HARDEST BARGAIN 



“They’re not supposed to ap- 
peal to mechanical tastes!” Buch- 
binder snapped. “I like them.” 
“Use the seals that say ‘Do Not 
Open until Inauguration Day,”’ 
Livingston told the robots, “and 
the heaviest wrapping tape. And 
be sure you make the knots good 
and tight, but very ornate, so it’ll 
seem a pity to undo them.” 

When the pictures were all 
wrapped, the robots carried them 
out carefully to the lawn. Foma 
was waiting next to his ship, in 
the midst of a welter of debris 
left by the children who had 
come to look at it while he was 
gone. Its once shining metallic 
sides were marred by scratches 
and even paint. Some of the dis- 
figuring marks were words. 

Buchbinder spelled them out 
laboriously: “MONSSTER GO 
HOAM!” “PREZIDENT BUK- 
BINDER LOVS EXTERATE- 
RESTRIALS!" “DR LIVINS- 
TUN ISNT AS SMART AS HE 
THINX HE IS!” 

“Oh, my goodness!” the Presi- 
dent exclaimed. “What a dreadful 
thing to have happen! I’ll have 
the robots clean it up at once!” 
“Children will be children,” 
Foma smiled. “I find the slogans 
rather amusing and, in fact, al- 
most decorative. I won’t have 
them touched.” And he started to 
turn to the pictures. 

The President gave a scared 
little gasp. “You’ve forgotten 

91 




something!” he babbled. “Under 
this tarpaulin. Maybe it’s impor- 
tant!" He started to lift the tar- 
paulin, but Foma stopped him. 

“No, I haven’t forgotten that. 
It’s — ah — some gear that can’t be 
put on board until after the cargo 
is loaded. Would you take the 
paper off the pictures?” he said 
to the robots. 

“They did them up so nicely,” 
the President said in a small voice. 
“It — it seems such a shame — ” 

“Don’t worry about it,” Foma 
told him. “I’m going to put them 
away in special hyperspace-proof 
batting, anyhow. And I wouldn’t 
be much of a trader if I bought 
goods sight unseen, now would I?” 

HE three of them stood there 
-*• in a dead silence as the robots 
unwrapped each picture. 

Foma’s eyes chilled into steel, 
including the one which had 
opened in the middle of his fore- 
head. “These are not the pictures 
I asked for.” 

“These are fine pictures,” Buch- 
binder faltered. “Very fine—” 

“They are very fine pictures. 
However, our bargain was for 
seven others. I kept my part of 
the bargain; I expect you to keep 
yours.” 

Livingston shrugged. “I’m 
afraid you hardly have much 
choice. You can’t contaminate the 
country all over again. Even if 
you have the means to do it, I 

n 



feel sure that your League would 
consider such behavior unethical.” 
“You’re quite right,” Foma 
agreed, “although I am rather sur- 
prised to find you able to even 
recognize an ethical point of 
view.” 

Livingston grasped the alien’s 
arm. “Be reasonable, man — er — 
Mr. Foma. These are excellent 
pictures we’re offering you, in tip- 
top condition. Only the best of 
pigments — and have you ever 
seen handsomer frames?” 

Foma shook him off. “Those 
are not the pictures we agreed 
upon. I refuse to accept them in 
payment of your debt.” 

Livingston grinned. “If you 
persist in your obstinacy, sir, I’m 
afraid you’ll have to go back to 
your planet unpaid.” 

“Maurice, Maurice,” the Presi- 
dent whimpered, tugging at his 
advisor’s sleeve, “this will give us 
a bad name in the Galaxy. They 
won’t come with food to trade 
any more.” 

“We won’t need their food, 
lunkhead!” Livingston snapped. 
“We can grow our own now.” He 
turned back to Foma. “That’s our 
final offer, sir. Take it or leave it!” 
“Your final offer, eh?” Foma re- 
peated. “Very well, then.” 

“Maurice,” Buchbinder bleated, 
“I’m afraid — ” 

“Shut up, Willis!” 

Foma yanked the tarpaulin 
away and disclosed what had 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



been concealed underneath it — 
his decontamination apparatus, 
already set up. 

“You’re going to make the land 
radioactive again!” the President 
gasped. “I told you, Maurice — ” 

“He wouldn’t dare!” Dr. Liv- 
ingston cried, but he was pale. 

“No,” Foma said, “I shall do 
nothing of the sort. All I want are 
my just dues. And, as I told you, 
this is an extremely versatile ma- 
chine.” He blew into a pipe. 

There was a moment of silence 
— a moment in which nothing 
happened, but everything seemed 
about to happen. Then there was 
a clattering sound. And, all of a 
sudden, the streets were filled 
with robots. They streamed down 
Pennsylvania Avenue, they 
streamed down Connecticut Ave- 
nue, marching in perfect unison. 

They marched toward the 
White House; they marched onto 
the lawn; they marched up the 
ramp and into the airlock of the 
spaceship, which expanded in a 
seemingly limitless way to accom- 
modate them. 

TTUNDREDS of them came, 
stolidly marching; thousands 
came, tens of thousands . until 
it was clear that the District of 
Columbia and its surrounding 
communities were being drained 
of their robots. 

“Call out the Army!” shouted 
the President. “Call out the Navy! 



Summon the Marine Corps.”! 

“They’re all robots,” Livingston 
said in a tired voice. “Except for 
the officers, of course, and all they 
can do is head parades and initial 
computer directives.” 

“The Secret Service? . No,” 
the President answered himself. 
“If the soldiers and sailors and 
marines are robots, then the Se- 
cret Service certainly must be.” 
He appealed to Foma. “Please 
turn off that machine! Turn it off! 
I’ll get you the pictures you 
wanted — and you can have these 
into the bargain. You can have 
the whole National Gallery, only 
please don’t take our robots!” 
“Too late,” said Foma, and his 
voice was grand and sad and 
smug. “Too late. A deal is a deal. 
When it’s broken, the injured 
party has every right to exact 
whatever payment he deems fit” 
Dr. Livingston stared at Foma, 
his eyes widening, then widening 
still further. “Then it wasn't a 
legend! You actually did it!” 
Foma bowed low. 

“What are you two agreeing 
about?” the President asked, look- 
ing bewilderedly from one to the 
other. 

Dr. Livingston ignored him. 
“Then take the children! Leave 
us our robots!” 

“We took the children a thou- 
sand years ago,” said Foma, “in 
payment for another bad debt, 
using an earlier model of this 

93 



THE HARDEST BARGAIN 



same machine. But that was only 
because there was nothing better 
to take. We also hoped — naively, 
as it turned out — that the lesson 
would teach you the high cost of 
sharp practice.” 

“Oh, I remember!” the Presi- 
dent exclaimed. “You got rid of 
the rats in some foreign town. 
And then, when the town officials 
wouldn’t pay up, you took the 
children. Some fellow wrote a 
poem about it — a rather long one 
that we studied in school. 
That must be how come you got 
the dates mixed up, Maurice,” he 
added, pleased with his own de- 
ductive faculties. 

“We took a considerable loss 
on that deal,” Foma said, “be- 
cause we found that, though hu- 
man children make delightful 
pets, they’re not much good when 
they grow up — absolutely no 
talent for solid, honest labor. No, 
the robots we can use; the chil- 
dren you can keep.” 

Dr. Livingston cleared his 
throat, uncomfortably this time, 
not complacently. “Then there 
really is an embargo on us.” 

“Yes, it was placed upon Earth 
on July 22, 1376, at a little town 
in Germany called Hameln — or, 
as Browning misspelled it, Hame- 
lin. In fact, that swindle is what 
gave rise to a simile we have in 
the Galaxy: ‘As untrustworthy as 
an Earthman.’ Obviously we can- 
not have diplomatic relations with 



a species that fits the ’slogan so 
exactly, especially after this piece 
of trickery. The embargo still 
stands.” 

The airlock clanged to and 
whirled shut behind him. 

Buchbinder and Livingston 
watched disconsolately as the 
spaceship zoomed up into the 
stratosphere. 

“Now we’ll never make the Big 
League,” the President moaned. 

“Aah, what kind of League 
would send a piper out as an 
emissary?” sneered Livingston. 
“And a pied piper, to boot.” 

A ND so the alien vessel hurtled 
out into space, taking all the 
robots in the country with it, ex- 
cept for a poor little crippled 
model from the West Coast, 
whose reaction time was as defec- 
tive as his judgment. He arrived 
from California two weeks later 
and was so upset at finding him- 
self left behind that he fused 
completely. 

Unrepresentative though he was 
of the strong, handsome, efficient 
robots that had gone with Foma, 
he was all the nation had to mem- 
orialize those it had once proudly 
owned, and he was given a niche 
in the Hall of Fame. He has the 
largest bronze plaque there — 
Browning’s poem, engraved all 
around the base, with appropri- 
ate footnotes by historians.

Illustrated by PETERFIELD 



There was one thing wrong with 
all the world being a stage . 
so many grudging people had to 
be bit players and stagehands! 



H E WANDERED aimless 
down the long corridor, 
opening doors and clos- 
ing them, feeling a growing frus- 
tration as each room stretched its 
yawning opulence before him. He 
was hungry and he wanted food. 
He wanted to find a single fire- 
place where no fire crackled cheer- 
fully. He wanted to find one door 
that failed to open at his touch. 
He knew his every move was be- 
ing watched and he wanted some- 
thing to happen, but most of all 
he wanted food. 



He tried another door, thrust it 
open impatiently and froze with 
his hand on the doorknob. 

A man stepped forward, plump, 
elderly, silver hair crowning his 
solemn face. His black coat made 
a most amusing, bulging V over 
his white shirt. He bowed humbly. 
“Did you ring, sir?” 

“I — don’t think so. Did you 
hear me ring?” 

“No, sir.” 

“Then I didn’t ring.” 

He backed away and closed the 
door firmly. “I’ll count doors,” he

told himself. “That should do it.” 

He moved on down the corri- 
dor, his feet sinking noiselessly 
into the plush piles of the carpet. 
“One!” He slammed open a door 
and glancing in at the flickering 
fire. He moved on. “Two!” he 
shouted. “Three!” He was ap- 
proaching the end of the corridor. 
He threw open another door. 
“Four!” 

The silver-haired man stood be- 
fore him, bowing humbly. “Did 
you ring, sir?” 

He gazed thoughtfully at the 
bulging V and pointed a trem- 
bling finger. “You — are — a — but- 
ler.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“I didn’t ring.” 

He closed the door quickly and 
hurried on. “Five!” 

T^AUSING to look out of the 
* multi-paned window at the 
end of the corridor, he saw only 
his own face reflected back at 
him. He turned angrily and started 
back down the opposite side of 
the corridor, savagely opening 
and shutting doors. 

“Six! Seven!” 

The butler’s face was blandly 
innocent. “Did you ring, sir?” 
“No!” 

He slammed the door, pushed 
it open again. “Did you hear me 
ring?” 

“No, sir.” 

“I didn’t ring.” 

96 



He stood for a moment by the 
closed door, scratching his head, 
before he moved on. 

“Eight!” 

The ninth door opened before 
he reached it and the butler 
stepped forward. “Did you ring, 
sir?” 

He pointed at the bulging V. 
“Did you hear me ring?” 

“Breakfast is served in the 
Green Room, sir. The Duchess is 
waiting.” 

“Oh.” He took three confident 
strides down the corridor, hesi- 
tated, and looked back. “You’re 
sure it’s in the Green Room?” 

“Yes, sir. If you would be so 
good as to follow me, sir . 

He followed, keeping his eyes 
on the sedate blackness of the 
butler’s broad back. 

As they entered the Green 
Room, the Duchess scrambled to 
her feet — a bit ungracefully, he 
thought— and hurried toward 
him, her flowing gown sweeping 
the carpet. He winced when her 
dry lips brushed his cheek. 

“Good morning, dear,” she said. 
There was a brittle eagerness in 
her bright voice. 

“Morning,” he said curtly. 

She returned to her chair and 
the butler escorted him to the 
other end of the long table and 
deftly seated him. He glowered 
distastefully at his egg cup. 

“Ham?” he asked hopefully. 

“I’m sorry, sir, but the doctor — 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



your stomach, you know.” 

Tm hungry!" 

“Would you like two eggs, sir?” 
Sadly he reached for a spoon 
and jabbed at the egg. 

The Duchess was picking deli- 
cately at her breakfast. He 
watched her curiously, wondering 
where he had seen her before. 
Joan of Arc? No. That girl had 
had a thinner face. A thinner fig- 
ure, too. The Duchess was actu- 
ally good - looking. Cleopatra — 
that was it. But he hadn’t been 
Julius Caesar for over a month. 
Odd that she would still be 
around. 

£ HE glanced up at him and his 
^ searching gaze triggered her 
face into an instant smile. “Did 
you sleep well, dear? I hope the 
speech isn’t worrying you.” 

He dropped his spoon and it 
clattered dully. “Speech?” 

“You have just three days now 
and Parliament will be in a fright- 
ful stew if you don’t have it 
ready. You will work on it this 
morning, won’t you, dear?” 

The butler whisked away his 
egg cup and returned it with an- 
other egg. He looked around for 
the salt and saw none. 

“Salt?” he said. 

“I’m sorry, sir, but your doc- 
tor . 

“I’ll get another doctor! I 
haven’t had a decent meal since 
Waterloo!” 

LEADING MAN 



He jabbed furiously with his 
spoon. He’d have to be someone 
healthy soon, he told himself, or 
he’d starve to death. 

The Duchess leisurely got to 
her feet. She was getting better 
with practice, he thought. 

“You will excuse me, won’t you, 
dear?” she asked. “I must go over 
the household accounts. I’ve been 
putting it off for days. I’ll be in 
the West Sewing Room.” 

He fed himself a large mouth- 
ful of egg and waved her away. 

“James, see that the Duke is 
settled in the library as soon as 
he’s finished breakfast. Do work 
hard on the speech, won’t you, 
dear?” 

She swept out of the room and 
he looked after her, nodding ap- 
provingly. She had a good figure. 
She’d even had a good figure as 
Cleopatra and there wasn’t any 
place for padding in that costume. 

He turned to the butler. “An- 
other egg.” 

“Sorry, sir, but your doctor . .” 

He shattered the egg cup on 
the floor and then followed the 
butler down the long corridor to 
the library. 

He sat for some time before the 
polished expanse of desk, doubt- 
fully eying the pile of scented 
paper that lay in front of him. He 
was hungry. Damn, but he was 
hungry! He wondered what he 
should do next. He glanced at the 
ring that circled the little finger 

97 



of his left hand — a large gold 
ring with 1319 engraved on it in 
tiny numbers. He rubbed it fu- 
tilely. Finally he seized a quill 
and scribbled a few lines on a 
perfumed sheet of paper. 

The door opened almost before 
he touched the bell. “You rang, 
sir?” 

“About this speech. Want to 
ask your opinion about some- 
thing.” 

“Certainly, sir.” 

“Beginning of a speech is very 
important, you know. Should 
catch the attention right from the 
first word. Universal appeal and 
all that sort of thing.” 

“I understand, sir.” 

“Wonder if you’d give me your 
opinion of this beginning.” 

“With pleasure, sir.” 

T1 E CLEARED his throat and 
bellowed, “Now is the 
time . .” He glanced up. The but- 
ler stood watching him attentive- 
ly, alert interest in his grave face. 

“Think it might go better with 
more emphasis on the ‘now’?” 

“Why don’t you try it that way, 
sir?” 

“Mmm — yes. Now is the 
time . .” 

“A decided improvement, sir.” 

“Thank you. Now don’t inter- 
rupt until Fve finished.” He got 
to his feet, paced back and forth 
briefly, and struck a heroic pose. 
“ Now is the time for all good men 



to come to the aid of their party.” 
He glanced at the butler. “What 
do you think?” 

“A most moving beginning, sir.” 
“Think it’ll do?” 

“I*m sure of it, sir.” 

“Tell me, James, just what is 
this speech supposed to be about?” 
“The Spanish crisis, sir. The en- 
tire nation is waiting to hear what 
the Duke of Wellington will have 
to say about it” 

“Spanish crisis? Spain? Is that 
in Africa?” 

“No, sir. In Europe. It’s close to 
Africa, of course.” 

“I see. I think, James, I’d like 
to have the Duchess hear this be- 
ginning.” 

“Certainly, sir. I’m sure she’ll 
be delighted.” 

He followed the butler, chuck- 
ling quietly to himself as James 
resolutely turned to the left and 
led him down the long corridor 
to the end of the east wing. James 
opened a door, glanced in and 
turned to him blankly. 

“I’m sorry, sir. I thought she 
said the East Sewing Room.” 

He shrugged indifferently and 
followed the butler back along 
the corridor to the end of the west 
wing. The Duchess was seated at 
the far end of the spacious room, 
talking quietly with a neatly 
dressed middle-aged woman. That 
would be the housekeeper, he told 
himself. Had he seen her some- 
where before? He couldn’t recall.

He noted their heaving bosoms 
with amusement, wondering where 
they had been that they had to 
dash back with such haste. 

“I have a beginning for this 
speech,” he said. “Want you to 
hear it.” 

“I’d be delighted, dear.” 

He paced about nervously. 

“Go right ahead, dear,” she said 
soothingly. “Just pretend I’m not 
here.” 

“ Now is the time,” he thun- 
dered, “for all good men to come 
to the aid of their party.” 

“Wonderful, dear. Is there 
more?” 

“No. That’s — that’s all I have 
at the moment.” 

“I’m sure Parliament will be 
delighted. You go right back and 
finish it.” 

^HE got to her feet and he 
^ stood staring at her until she 
flushed and backed away anx- 
iously. The butler stepped for- 
ward and placed a firm hand on 
his arm. 

“Where’s my harem?” he mut- 
tered. 

“Your — harem, sir?” the butler 
said. 

“Where’s my harem?” he 
shouted. “Just because the Duke 
of Wellington invites me — what 
did you do with my harem?” 

The Duchess and the house- 
keeper scurried out of the room 
in near panic. 



“You’ve embarrassed the ladies, 
Your Excellency,” the butler said. 
“Naturally the Duke couldn’t per- 
mit your harem here — politics, 
you know. But if you’ll come with 
me, I’ll be glad to take you.” 

He allowed himself to be led 
away. With the butler’s plodding 
assistance, he attired himself in 
robes and a turban, awkwardly 
mounted a camel that awaited 
him at the front door, and rode 
off through the park with an es- 
cort dashingly mounted on pranc- 
ing Arabian horses. 

On the far side of the park, 
they came to a tent village. The 
last tents were just going up and 
the turtaned workers were per- 
spiring in the crisp fall air. 

A rotund, turbaned figure 
darted from the nearest tent, 
robes trailing, sank to his knees 
and pressed his forehead to the 
ground. “All awaits your pleasure, 
Excellency.” 

“Arise,” he commanded. “I ex- 
pect to eat well today. My favor- 
ite dishes.” 

“It is arranged. Will you honor 
your wives with your presence?” 

“Later. The ride was long. I 
need rest.” 

He followed the bowing figure 
into a spacious tent. 

“My favorite dishes, mind you,” 
he said sharply. 

“It is arranged, Excellency.” 

He stretched out on a pile of 
rugs and closed his eyes. Music

drifted in from the tent that 
joined his. Pleasantly exotic, it al- 
most made him forget the hunger 
that seethed within him. He lis- 
tened until he lost himself in 
sleep. 

It was afternoon when he 
awoke. His hunger brought him 
off the rugs with a bound. Attend- 
ants hurried in and immediately 
the music started. 

“I will watch my wives dance 
while I eat,” he said. 

He strode haughtily into the 
adjoining tent and seated himself 
on a rug-decked dais. An attend- 
ant humbly placed food before 
him. The music grew louder and 
the scantily clad girls began 
writhing about with immodest 
abandon. 

H E TASTED the warm, wa- 
tery wine, grimaced, but 
made himself drink deeply. He 
plunged his fingers into a sickly- 
looking stew, brought out a piece 
of meat, tasted it and spat angrily. 
“In Allah’s name, what is this?” 
“Your favorite dish, Excellency. 
Camel stew. Would you like a 
larger portion?” 

He took another piece of meat 
and worked his teeth uselessly on 
the rubbery texture. “This camel 
was old before its time,” he 
snarled. 

“It is the old camels that Allah 
blesses with flavor.” 

He chewed energetically and 



forced some pieces of meat down 
his throat. To his surprise, they 
stayed down. Still ravenously 
hungry, he waved the food away 
and turned his attention to the 
dancing girls. 

He recognized several of them. 
A lusty-looking brunette had been 
Madame Pompadour the last 
time he was Louis XV. He recog- 
nized a former Queen Elizabeth 
and a former Josephine, and sud- 
denly he saw, sitting demurely in 
a far corner, his late Duchess. 

She did have a good figure. 
And the filmy dancing-girl cos- 
tume suited it perfectly — much 
more so than had her Cleopatra 
costume. She wasn’t the queenly 
type, he told himself. She should 
stick to the simpler roles. 

Leaning forward, he summoned 
her with a commanding gesture. 
She moved toward him almost re- 
luctantly, sank to her knees at his 
feet, and blushed furiously as he 
drew her up beside him. 

“More music,” he called. 
“Louder.” 

The twangy, whining notes 
crescendoed to an ear-straining 
level, and the dancers whirled 
faster. With a sudden impulse, he 
picked up the girl and carried her 
into the next tent. 

Attendants fled in discreet 
panic. He placed her gently on 
the rugs and began covering her 
with passionate caresses and 
kisses. The deft way she plucked

the hypodermic syringe from her 
brief costume delighted him. He 
pretended not to notice, even 
when she plunged it into his arm. 
He counted ten slowly and began 
to relax. In a few minutes, he was 
feigning sleep and she carefully 
covered him with a rug and tip- 
toed away. 



A ROTUND, turbaned figure, 
alias James the butler, met 
the girl as she came out of the 
tent. “Everything all right. Doctor 
Rogers?” he asked. 

“Hypo,” she said. “He was get- 
ting pretty worked up. He should 
be out for several hours.” 

“It’ll do him good. It’s usually 
a strain on them when they 
switch characters so quickly. Too 
bad. For a few minutes, I thought 
he was actually going to come up 
with a speech. It would have been 
interesting, getting a parliament 
together and letting him deliver 
it.” 



“Yes. Maybe we pressed him 
too hard on that speech. Respon- 
sibility always makes them re- 
gress if they aren’t ready for it.” 
“Don’t I know it! We had 1296 



all ready to cross the Delaware 
last week and the strain of mak- 
ing that decision made him re- 
gress clear back to toy soldiers. 
He hasn’t come out of it yet. But

along nicely. He was magnificent

loo. Today he seemed confused, 
as if being the Duke of Welling- 
ton was our idea instead of his. I 
don’t think the speech was wholly 
responsible.” 

“Nothing to do but wait now,” 
she said. ‘We’ll see what he is 
when he wakes up. Going to leave 
the tents standing?” 

“Might as well. We may get an- 
other call for them.” 

“I’ll have to get back and 
change and file my report. Have 
the others left?” 

“Oh, yes. They left the minute 
you were — abducted.” 

He helped her roll an aircar out 
of a tent. She took off, and five 
minutes later she brought it in for 
a landing in the spacious Central 
Administration parking lot. 

Most of the harem girls had al- 
ready changed when she reached 
the dressing room. They were 
trimly attired in crisp white coats 
and white skirts, and except for 
several who were having aching 
legs massaged, their mien was 
strictly professional. 

“Stell,” a husky blonde called, 
“what happened there, anyway? 
I thought 1319 was the Duke of 
Wellington today.” 

“Sudden regress,” Dr. Rogers 
said, peeling off her dancing cos- 
tume. “Right in the middle of 
preparing a speech for Parlia- 
ment, he started shouting for his 
harem. I’m afraid he nearly 
cracked.” 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“He would pick a time when 
I’m on call. Mow’d you make out? 
Was he impetuous?” 

“Very. I hypoed him.” 

“Good girl. I was glad when he 
carried you out Another five min- 
utes of dancing — hello!” 

A sedate middle-aged woman — 
1319 would have recognized her 
as the Duke of Wellington’s 
housekeeper — dashed in and 
peered about nervously. “Emer- 
gency! Harem requested for 738.” 
“Oh, my God!” the blonde 
groaned. 

r I"* HE patter of conversation in 
the room cut off abruptly. 
“Who is it for?” 

“Twice in one day! What next?” 
“Are they giving 738 hor- 
mones? It was only day before 
yesterday . 

“You should complain,” the 
blonde snapped. “You’re not his 
favorite. I’m still black and blue 
from the last time. If that lecher- 
ous old buzzard tries to paw me 
today . .” 

“Don’t forget your hypo!” 

“I won’t. I know darn well I’ll 
need it” 

The wardrobe attendant was 
moving among them, passing out 
the dancing-girl costumes. The 
girls struggled into them. 

“What was 738 doing?” 

“He was a college professor to- 
day. Teaching Einstein’s Theory 
of Relativity to undergraduates. 



They say it was really weird.” 
“One of his students probably 
showed him too much leg, and 
bang, he wanted a harem. That’s 
all it would take with him.” 

The middle-aged woman was 
counting confusedly. “Dr. Rogers, 
are you available?” 

“Afraid not,” Doctor Rogers 
said, buttoning her white coat. “I 
have to file my report on 1319." 

“Hurry it up, girls. The aircars 
are waiting. We’ve already sent a 
camel for him.” 

“Dr. Zerbi left the tents up,” 
Dr. Rogers said. “But 1319 is still 
there.” 

“He’s already been moved back 
to his permanent quarters. Better 
put that in your report. Dr. Cam- 
eron, will you take charge?” 

“You just bet I will,” the blonde 
said. “I’ll make a fuss over him 
right from the start and maybe 
we can cut the dancing short. My 
legs wouldn’t take much more.” 
They trooped out, chattering 
irritably. 

Dr. Rogers left the dressing 
room, stepped onto the moving 
hallway and rode to her office in 
Wing M — the male division. She 
shared an office with a taciturn 
young male doctor who always 
seemed half frightened of her. He 
was seated glumly behind his 
desk and did not notice her as she 
entered. 

“Good afternoon, Doctor Karl,” 
she said primly. 



LEADING MAN 



103 



“Oh. Good afternoon, Doctor 
Rogers.” 

She sat down, dialed 1319, and 
a record card dropped onto her 
desk. She studied it then snapped 
her fingers. “I knew I’d seen him 
somewhere. He was Julius Caesar. 
That was the first week I came 
here. I was Cleopatra. I was 
scared stiff.” 

“How long ago was that?” Doc- 
tor Karl asked. 

“A little over a month ago.” 

“They must like your work. 
Not many stay longer than three 
weeks.” 

“It’s more likely that I haven’t 
progressed rapidly enough to be 
moved along,” she said dryly. 

S HE penned another entry onto 
the card and sat back, looking 
at it thoughtfully. “I wonder if 
he’ll ever be cured. He’s not so 
old and he really seems like a 
nice person. But he’s been here 
six months and he keeps building 
up and regressing.” 

“The directors know what 
they’re doing. If he was hopeless, 
they wouldn’t have him here.” 
“The patients really have it 
soft, don’t they? Look here. He 
decided he was Napoleon, so we 
gave him a luscious Josephine 
and a court. He went off to fight 
the Battle of Austerlitz and we 
gave him an army. Then he made 
himself Duke of Wellington and 
beat his former self at Waterloo. 

104 



Today he wanted a harem and 
we gave him one. Seems as though 
you have to be insane to have any 
fun.” 

He winced. “Hush! Not that 
word — we have no insane people 
here. Our patients merely suffer 
mental delusions.” 

“They don’t suffer anything. 
They enjoy every minute of it 
Think of the money it must cost 
to run this place.” 

“These patients aren’t ordinary 
people. They have talents our 
civilization needs. They’re worth 
saving at any cost.” 

“So I’ve been told. But how 
many do we save? I haven’t heard 
of a single cure since I’ve been 
here. We staff members come and 
go, but the patients stay on.” 
“It’s a new dimension in men- 
tal therapy, of course,” he said 
thoughtfully. “But there must be 
lots of cures. Look at the case 
numbers.” He glanced at his 
watch and got to his feet. “Have 
to run. Women’s Division has a 
Helen of Troy today and I’m 
drafted for a battle scene.” 

“Just wait,” she said. “You’ll 
end up envying the patients, too.” 
He called over his shoulder, 
“I’ve envied them since the day I 
got here.” 

She carried 1319’s card down 
to Central Administration and 
asked about her next assignment. 
Doctor Bamstall, the personnel 
director, peered at her inquir- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ingly, eyes serious behind his 
thick glasses. 

“You look depressed,” he said. 
“Maybe I am. I’m beginning to 
envy the patients.” 

“Nothing to worry about. It 
happens to most staff members 
sooner or later.” 

“Is that why staff personnel is 
changed so often? I’ve wondered.” 
“That’s part of the reason. Are 
you serious about it?” 

“I suppose so. It seems like — 
every little whim they have, we 
jump to satisfy, and they haven’t 
a worry in the world, and yet we 
never seem to get anywhere with 
them. They’re always regressing.” 
He smiled. “Take the rest of 
the afternoon off. I’ll keep you as- 
signed to 1319 and it’ll be evening 
now before he picks up a new di- 
rection. Or would you rather have 
a change?” 

“Oh, no. I don’t mind 1319.” 
“Fine. But you do need some- 
thing new, something fresh. Let’s 
see.” He pulled her record card 
and studied it carefully. “Juliet, I 
think. You might enjoy that. I’ll 
let you be Juliet the next time 
we get a call.” 

She sighed, somehow feeling 
more depressed than ever. “Thank 
you,” she said. “That might be 
nice. I didn’t care for the duchess 
role.” 

She went out and walked across 
the sunlit park toward her own 
quarters. The sound of rippling 



water reached her from a spa- 
cious, circular building and she 
paused to peer through a one-way 
observation port. 

The calm Pacific Ocean 
stretched before her to the far 
horizon. Six men lounged on a 
battered Kon Tiki, nonchalantly 
floating it toward a distant and 
invisible Pacific island. One was 
a patient; the other five were staff 
members, laboring mightily to stay 
in character. 

She sighed. “The patients have 
all the fun,” she said to herself, 
and she hurried to her quarters. 

T YING on the cot in his quar- 
■*-* ters, 1319 tried to think about 
something that would not suggest 
food. Or eating. If he could have 
one decent meal, he thought, he 
might survive. But it would have 
to come soon. 

It was evening and there had 
been considerable activity outside 
his door and he was growing im- 
patient. He twisted restlessly and 
turned over, still feigning sleep in 
case someone was scanning him. 

The voices in the hallway faded 
into the distance. He carefully 
edged a blanket over his head, 
clicked a microscopic switch on 
his ring and spoke softly. 

“Jones reporting.” 

The ring squeaked back at him. 
“One moment, please.” 

He relaxed and waited until a 
male voice rasped out “Nice work, 



LEADING MAN 



IOS 



Jones. That was a clever switch 
you pulled.” 

“Glad you think so,” Jones said. 
“I could see that the Wellington 
line was taking us nowhere. But 
you never know what to expect 
from these people. They come up 
with the damnedest things. Have 
you ever tasted camel stew?” 
“Can’t say I have.” 

“May fate spare you that pleas- 
ure. Wonder where they got the 
stuff. Are we missing a camel?” 
“No. The inventory checks.” 
“They carry realism too far.” 
“It does them good. You came 
up with some fine acting today. 
You deserve a bonus.” 

“I’ll take it in steaks. I’m hun- 
gry” 

“You’ll be Romeo when you 
wake up. Give it a good play.” 
“Sure. And by the way — ” 
“What’s the trouble?” 

“If it turns out that Romeo has 
a bad stomach or a passion for 
raw vegetables, I’m resigning.” 

He clicked off the radio, turned 
over abruptly and rolled off the 
cot. Seconds later, the door burst 
open and an attendant hurried in. 
Pushing himself into a sitting po- 
sition, 1319 mumbled groggily. 

“Pid you sleep well, Excel- 
lency?” the attendant said. “Do 
you wish to visit your harem?” 
"What harem?” 1319 de- 
manded. “Where’s Juliet?” 

The attendant took a step back- 
ward. “Juliet?” 

106 



“I have a date with Juliet. 
Can’t be late. Got to watch out 
for those Capulets, too. Where’s 
my sword?” 

The attendant unwound the 
turban from 1319’s head. “Of 
course. You’ll have to dress first 
and then I’ll take you to Friar 
Laurence. Now wait a moment 
while I make the arrangements.” 

It was hard for 1319 to hold 
back his chuckle till he was alone. 
He’d caught them flatfooted. Sud- 
denly his ring finger tingled and 
he pressed it to his ear. 

“Make this good now. Rogers 
will be your Juliet and I think 
we’re going to pull her out of it.” 

He moved the ring and whis- 
pered without moving his lips, 
“Who’s Rogers?” 

“Your Duchess. The girl in the 
harem. That trick you pulled was 
evidently just what she needed. 
She’s starting to think at last. We 
were getting worried about her. 
She’s been here over a month, 
with almost no progress. She has 
a brilliant mind and insanity is 
too much a luxury for people like 
that.” 

The attendant hurried back 
into the room, “Just follow me,” 
he said. 

Following him, 1319 was half 
lost in his own thoughts. Verona, 
sixteenth century. Should be some 
good seafood. He could do with 
a thick filet.

TALES OF GOOSEFLESH 
AND LAUGHTER by John 
Wyndham. Ballantine Books, 
N. Y., $0.35 

/^NE must be either a hermit 
or a non-aficionado if one 
doesn’t know by now that “John 
Wyndham” is the old familiar 
John Beynon Harris of the early 
and mid-thirties and hasn’t he 
come a long way since then! 

This current collection is al- 
most pure fantasy, with a couple 
of S-F yams thrown in as a 
change of pace. Wyndham ranges 
from sheer lunacy in “Una,” a de- 



lightfully zany pitch with the 
same plot gimmick as Gold’s fa- 
mous “Problem in Murder,” to 
sheer horror in “Jizzle” and the 
sorrily titled “More Spinned 
Against.” 

“Chinese Puzzle,” concerning a 
very well-mannered, exotically 
colored, genuine Chinese dragon 
transplanted to alien Welsh soil, 
and “Confidence Trick,” in which 
five people are sped to Hell on 
a misguided Underground train, 
are works in the best light fantasy 
tradition of John Collier. High, 
praise, indeed, for any author.

THE BEST SCIENCE - FIC - 
TION STORIES AND NOV- 
ELS: 1956, edited by T. E. Dikty. 
Frederick Fell, Inc., N. Y., $3.50 

r| IKTY’S current anthology is 
somewhat less of an event 
than previously. For one thing, it 
is a wizened volume compared to 
its robust predecessors. Also, the 
title is a misnomer: don’t look for 
more than one novella among the 
fourteen stories. The majority of 
yarns are good to excellent, with 
only a couple of minor efforts. 
However, one has become so ac- 
customed throughout the years to 
heavyweights bearing the Dikty 
label that the ordinary commer- 
cial-sized book looks strangely 
undernourished. 

The novella, “The Shores of 
Night” by Thomas N. Scortia, is 
a combination space opera/muta- 
tion yarn with both aspects un- 
derplayed, so that it emerges as 
a psychological study. It is in- 
clined to turgidity and murkiness, 
but sustains interest. 

Among the longer shorts, “A 
Canticle for Liebowitz” by Miller, 
Jr. and “Swenson, Dispatcher” by 
Miller — respectively, Walter M. 
and R. DeWitt — stand out. “Cler- 
ical Error” by Mark Clifton is a 
rather fanciful solution to the se- 

108 



curity-engendered psychosis prob- 
lem among government scientists, 
but darned if it doesn’t appear 
that only bureaucratic thinking 
will overcome the bureaucratic 
mind. 

Dikty has his usual annual sur- 
vey, chockful of info unobtain- 
able elsewhere unless you operate 
a clipping service, and Earl 
Kemp’s “Science-Fiction Book 
Index” is always an informative 
feature, listing American, Cana- 
dian and British publications for 
the year. 

Good, yes — but bring back the 
king-sized Dikty. 

TALES FROM THE WHITE 
HART by Arthur C. Clarke. Bal- 
lantine Books, N. Y., $2.00 

TT ERE is another delightful 
collection from Britain by 
Ballantine. This time Arthur 
Clarke leaves off from his galaxy- 
shaking epics to spin as light and 
frothy a conglomeration of side- 
splitters as it has been my good 
fortune to read. Clarke has done 
for the London pub, the “White 
Hart,” what the lamented Fletch- 
er Pratt and Sprague de Camp 
did for “Gavagan’s Bar.” 

His Munchausen is a fog-horn- 
voiced character named Harry 
Purvis, a most uningratiating 
know-it-all, the type we’re all too 
familiar with, but more so. How- 
ever, as the collection progresses 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



from the incredible to the unbe- 
lievable, Purvis becomes accept- 
able — almost lovable — particu- 
larly in “What Goes Up,” in which 
he squelches a vociferous Flying 
Sorcerer with a four-thousand- 
mile-high tall story. One must 
pull up aghast and awestruck at 
this story. 

An atomic experiment goes 
awry in the midst of an Austral- 
ian desert, leaving an impenetra- 
ble zone of force which, investiga- 
tion discloses, is equivalent to a 
four-thousand-mile mountain as 
far as power requirements for 
reaching across the twenty-foot 
gap from wall-to-zone center are 
concerned. 

I can’t go on. The audacity of 
this super-whopper leaves me 
nothing more to say — but don’t 
miss it. 

This is a Clarke you’ve never 
suspected existed, but one you’ll 
hope to see again soon.

references were unfamiliar. The 
book, however, is complete by it- 
self and is a delightful fantastic 
fable of the type in which the 
English have excelled since — or 
perhaps because of — Lewis Car- 
roll. 

The downfall of the kingdom 
of Narnia is assured from the mo- 
ment that the Ape, Shift, mas- 
querades the donkey, Puzzle, in a 
lion skin as the Great Lion, Aslan. 
Acting as the mouthpiece of As- 
lan, the Ape is guilty of so many 
treacheries that it becomes nec- 
essary for the king, Tirian, to 
summon aid from beyond the 
world’s end. 

The youngsters will be de- 
lighted to see who answers the 
call.

D onald wollheim went 

and spilled the Secret of the 
Martian Moons some months 
back and now everyone knows 
that Phobos is artificial, at least 
in fiction. In this juvenile, Phobos 
is a giant computer that got left 
behind when Mars was evacuated 
eons ago. It has strictly machinis- 
tic motivations, but also a sort of 
pseudo-curiosity. By listening in 
on broadcasts, it has absorbed 
considerable lore, but, very un- 
derstandably, no sophistication. 

It kidnaps a leading artist, his 
daughter and a friend by means 
of a flying saucer. Previously, it 
had snatched a sailor named Wil- 
liam Shakespeare in quest of an- 
swers to the strange riddle of hu- 
man emotions. 

A strange critter, this Phobos — 
no sense of humor at all. I have 
no doubt that the younger folks 
will enjoy the story, if only to see 
how it is ultimately outwitted.

shock troop 



By DANIEL F. GALOUYE 



Commander Lasson fa cea a bitter 
battle, but he had the ultimate 
tactic . subdivide and conquer! 



I N ALL his seven major cam- 
paigns, Commander Lasson 
had seen nothing quite like 
this situation. 

First there was the heat — 
humid, stifling, insufferable. 

Then there were the constant 
jolts and convulsions. 

But most unbearable of all was 
the interminable cross-pulse, the 
monotonous thrump-thump . 
thrump-thump . thrump-thump. 



Enough to drive a macro-con- 
trol crew crazy! 

Commander Lasson emerged 
from the tunnel and straightened 
his cramped joints. He glanced 
tentatively around, taking in the 
cavernous expanse of the control 
compartment, with its master 
console suspended from a tri-axial 
mount, the busy crews of psycho- 
electricians who — 

He stiffened with apprehension. 



Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



Like a deep-throated growl, the 
convulsion raced along the tunnel 
behind him. 

“All hands hit the stanchions!” 
he bellowed into the chamber as 
he clutched the nearest upright. 

The crew scurried to safety 
and Lasson watched the spasmod- 
ic wave shudder past, buckling 
the artificially calcified floor and 
lacing the smooth surface with 
new networks of cracks. 

Jarring violently, the entire 
cavern shifted. The main control 
console lurched and swung pon- 
derously around on its axes. Pen- 
dulumlike, it settled against a 
new direction of gravity. 

Commander Lasson disentan- 
gled himself from the stanchion 
and brushed off his uniform. 

Damned convulsions! He spat, 
as though he could convey his 
anger through the pulsating wall 
to the unsuspecting macro-entity. 

Then he smiled confidently as 
he resumed his pompous stride 
into the compartment. They 
would win! They would subdue 
the creature and bring it under 
permanent positive control! 

And then, if not before, would 
come the modifications — thermo- 
biological conditioning to lower 
the heat, a damping system to 
muffle the cross-pulse beat, neuro- 
muscular controls to put an end 
to the spasms. 

He had done it before with the 
dominant life-forms on seven 

112 



other worlds. And each time he 
had gone back to Valvarez as a 
conquering hero. He had no doubt 
that there would be an eighth tri- 
umphal return for him and his 
shock troop. 

QHOVING aside technicians 
^ who were busy connecting 
leads from the various tunnels, 
Lasson drew up stiffly in the cen- 
ter of the compartment. 

“All section chiefs front and 
center!” he ordered. 

The leaders left their crews 
and drew up uncertainly before 
the commander. 

“Jerapy.” Lasson singled out 
one of them. “Are we pulling 
enough oxygen from the sepa- 
rators?” 

“Enough for the shock troop, 
sir,” the lieutenant replied quea- 
sily. “But we’re having trouble set- 
ting up the operational test. Can’t 
find a capillary large enough to 
take care of ten thousand colo- 
nists.” 

Commander Lasson bristled. 
“Then tunnel out until you do 
find one! That project has pri- 
ority. Besides finding out whether 
we can capture positive control 
of the entity, we’re here to deter- 
mine if it will suit the needs of 
Valvarez!” 

Jerapy shrank away, saluting 
awkwardly. 

“Mandor! Report on the status 
of all major connections.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Another aide shuffled forward 
reluctantly. “Motor Fiber Forty- 
six secure and ready for hookup 
with the central selector circuit. 
Locomotion Trunk C will be tied 
in before the end of this shift. 
We’re clearing through the audi- 
tory-intercept system now. Next 
comes the kinesthetic-intercept 
relay.” 

“Have you taken current meas- 
urements?” 

“The subject is supplying more 
than enough psycho-amps to op- 
erate all our equipment.” 

“Excellent! At this rate, we 
should be able to start on the 
vocal associative counter-transfer 
circuit by the next shift.” 

“We’ve already phased the in- 
terpretive feedback, sir,” the lieu- 
tenant reported proudly. 

Another section chief stepped 
from behind the central control 
console. “The visual-intercept cir- 
cuit is ready to be checked, sir.” 
Dismissing the others, Lasson 
crossed eagerly to the control 
board, nudged a crewman 
abruptly out of his way and 
climbed into the operator’s seat. 

“You may throw the switch, 
Parok,” he directed. 

The chiefs hand darted out 
and flicked a lever. Lasson 
leaned back to wait for the huge 
screen above the cabinet to come 
alive. Absently, he listened to the 
coarse gutturals of a sergeant 
marching his detachment out of 



a main trunk line tunnel and to- 
ward crew quarters: “Hup, two, 
three. Hup, two, three.” 

Parok, one eye fastened on the 
screen, glanced thoughtfully at 
the commander. “Do you suppose 
it — knows, sir?” 

“About us? Our operation? Of 
course not. They’re intelligent, 
but only to a degree.” 

“But those convulsions.” 
“Merely reflex action.” 

“So many?” 

“Put it down as hypersensi- 
tivity. When we bring its sym- 
pathetic nervous system under 
control, we’ll eliminate that in- 
convenience.” 

The sergeant’s “hup, two, three” 
trailed off into inaudibility as his 
detachment pushed on into yet 
another tunnel. Then the visual- 
intercept screen flared brilliantly, 
flooding the central control com- 
partment with its intense white 
glow. 



A D JUSTING the controls, Las- 
son resolved the picture as 
best he could and took his first 
vicarious look into the macro- 
world. 

The host entity, it appeared, 
was in an enclosure with artifacts 
of its environment around it. 
From the orderly flow of these 
articles across the visual-intercept 
screen, the commander surmised 
the thing was probably moving 
around slowly, aimlessly. 



SHOCK TROOP 



113 



But all the furnishings were 
clouded in a fog of haziness that 
made it doubly difficult to guess 
their functions. 

“Parok!” he called irately. 
“Something’s wrong. We’re get- 
ting a myopic effect.” 

“Yes, sir,” the chief conceded 
humbly, staring worriedly over 
the commander’s shoulder. “Per- 
haps the entity’s optical system 
is faulty.” 

“Nonsense. The chances are al- 
most astronomical against that. 
It’s in our circuit somewhere.” 
“In the optical coordination 
controls, maybe?” 

“Idiot! We’re not controlling 
now. We’re merely tapping in. 
Trace your circuits and find the 
trouble — immediately!” 

T>AROK went obediently be- 
hind the control console. 
Lasson scowled at the proces- 
sion of indistinguishable objects 
across his screen, as relayed by 
the creature’s sweeping vision. 

The things in the foreground 
were somewhat clearer than the 
others. There was a flat-surfaced 
item on rigid legs with an appar- 
ently soft horizontal plane which 
could be the equivalent to a Val- 
varezian bunk. And there was an- 
other article that resembled a 
chair. 

In the background, though, was 
a blurred pattern of light and 
dark stripes that could hardly be 

114 



compared with anything he had 
encountered before. 

An agonized scream sounded 
behind the console. Lasson 
snapped off the visual-intercept 
switch and lunged from the seat. 
Around the panel, he found Parok 
bending over another neuro-tech- 
nician, whose unconscious form 
was draped across the lead com- 
ing from the cross-index rectifier. 

“What happened?” the com- 
mander demanded. 

“He stumbled into the high- 
tension wire and got a full load of 
psycho-electric current,” Parok 
said. 

Lasson watched disinterestedly 
as small quivering ripples coursed 
over the unconscious man’s flesh. 
Cellular disestablishment, touched 
off by the charge’s electric com- 
ponent, would continue unchecked 
until the biological disorganiza- 
tion inevitably led to death. 

“Damned fool!” the comman- 
der exclaimed angrily. “He’s no 
good to us now. Feed him into a 
waste ejector.” 

“But,” Parok pleaded, “he’ll live 
another three or four—” 

Lasson silenced him with a 
severe glance. He would tolerate 
no argument — not in this infernal 
heat — not with what was left of 
his patience being sapped away by 
the relentless thrump-thump, 
thrump - thump that beat all 
around him like drums booming. 

He turned away dispiritedly 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




SHOCK TROOP 



and headed for his quarters. It 
was always happening on these 
test confiscations. Death by con- 
tact with electricity was the prin- 
cipal hazard for the advance 
guard that went out to determine 
whether any given macro-life- 
form was suitable for host-para- 
site colonization. But nothing 
could be done about that 

J OLTED awake by the strident 
clanging of the Class A alarm 
bell, Lasson sprang from his bunk 
and raced into the corridor. He 
reached into the stream of scurry- 
ing macro-controlmen and 
snatched one of them by the arm. 

“Leucocyte breakthrough!” the 
man explained, horrified. “Trunk 
C tunnel!” 

The commander joined the 
rush of frenzied emergency per- 
sonnel and sprinted across the 
central control compartment, past 
the vehicular access corridor 
where the shuttle lay at anchor 
and into the Locomotion Trunk 
C tunnel. 

Ahead, standby crews were 
pushing forward, lugging portable 
floodlights, hand-sterilizers and 
broad-beam coagulators. 

He overtook them and charged 
past, rounding a bend and almost 
stumbling on a trunk lead that 
stretched along the floor like a 
great bacillus. 

The scene was one of frantic 
disorder as the corridor reverber- 

116 



ated hollowly with the groans of 
dying men and the shouts of 
others who faced the horrors of 
the leucocyte attack. 

The break was through the left 
wall of the tunnel. It was hemor- 
rhaging profusely, letting through 
a torrent of viscous thrombin, to- 
gether with an occasional gray 
mass, lumpy and ominous. 

Already the corridor was 
flooded halfway to the ceiling and 
stubborn crewmen were staging a 
valiant fight to reach the section 
of ruptured wall. 

Lasson waded knee-deep in the 
nauseous substance. A nearly sub- 
merged erythrocyte rammed into 
his leg and almost threw him off 
balance. But Paffun, the section 
chief, caught his arm. 

The commander turned to give 
orders to the subordinate, but the 
red corpuscle, as though play- 
fully curious, surged back and 
struck him forcefully from the 
rear. His knees buckled and he 
splashed forward into the repul- 
sive mess. 

He managed to keep his head 
above the sea of thrombin, but as 
he tried to regain his feet, the 
erythrocyte returned a second 
time, bringing another disc-shaped 
cell with it 

QOMEHOW the first corpuscle 
^ managed to maneuver its 
bulk between two of the comman- 
der’s legs. He came erect with a 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



high-pitched shout that was not 
altogether an outburst of rage. 

The thing’s companion sur- 
faced, flipped over and sent a 
spray of thrombin splattering 
against his face. Lasson kicked 
out vengefully at the closer of 
the two. 

Paffun seized his arm again to 
keep him from falling a second 
time. 

“We need more coagulator 
crewmen!” the chief shouted 
above the din of gushing blood 
and screaming Valvarezians. 

“They’re on their way.” Lasson 
looked down at the thrombin 
clinging to his uniform and al- 
ready solidifying. “This hemor- 
rhage cost us many casualties?” 

Paffun shook his head dismally. 
“More than a score so far. We — ” 

The chief cut his words short 
with a terrified scream as a chalk- 
white mass reared up out of the 
rising tide of thrombin and, ame- 
balike, extended a pseudopod to- 
ward him. 

T ASSON cut it down with his 
sterilizer and kicked inquisi- 
tive erythrocytes revoltedly out 
of the way. 

“Damned leucos!” he growled 
at the quivering white horror. 

Close to the breakthrough, two 
crewmen yelled as great frighten- 
ing arms swept up out of the 
boiling sea of blood and embraced 
them in a grip of acid death. 



Their shouts ended in gurgling 
sounds when they were dragged 
under the surface. 

“Bring up those reinforce- 
ments!” the commander roared 
back down the tunnel. He jock- 
eyed to keep his balance in blood 
that was now waist-deep. “Paffun, 
order retreat. We’ve got to draw 
back and block off the entire cor- 
ridor.” 

Even as the chief called off his 
men, three more Valvarezians fell 
victim to the flailing pseudopods. 

“Trunk C,” Paffun reminded 
hesitantly, “is our most important 
project at this stage.” 

‘We’ll cut a detour. Too many 
capillaries in this section any- 
way.” 

They withdrew until the throm- 
bin was only ankle-deep. Isolated 
and exposed red corpuscles were 
everywhere, writhing in the grip 
of death. Battle-weary survivors 
stepped cautiously over them in 
retreat 

A first line of containment 
formed across the tunnel, with 
sterilizer and coagulator crewmen 
standing shoulder to shoulder and 
playing their weapons against the 
advancing tide. 

Lasson waited until all the visi- 
ble red cells, together with the 
monstrous leucocytes, were frozen 
motionless in the rapidly curdling 
fibrin. 

Then he wearily made his way 
back to the central compartment 



SHOCK TROOP 



117 



Y\ ESPITE the fact that that he 
had had ample rest after the 
leucocyte encounter, Commander 
Lasson was haggard and dispir- 
ited as he slumped beside the 
control console. It was difficult to 
dislodge from his thoughts the 
hordes of shapeless white horrors 
that lurked just beyond the thinly 
calcified walls. 

He sighed in resignation, realiz- 
ing that he might forget them if 
it weren’t for that infernal 
thrump - thump, thrump - thump 
that was a constant reminder of 
the nearness and profusion of the 
treacherous capillaries. 

Lasson loosened the soggy and 
wilted collar of his uniform and 
swiped his face with a limp hand. 
Damned insufferable heat! Filthy, 
rotten, putrid air! 

“Baldon!” he shouted impa- 
tiently. 

The crewman started, looked 
up from the ventilation duct on 
which he had been working, 
dropped his tools and hurried 
over. 

“What’s wrong now?” Lasson 
demanded. “You call this”— he 
waved a hand in front of him — 
“air?” 

“We have our oxygen separator 
system working at two-thirds ca- 
pacity, sir.” 

“And why aren’t we using all 
three of them?” 

“It’s the fibrinogen, sir. Keeps 
jelling in the intakes. We haven’t 

118 



found the right counteragent yet 
to stop coagulation. So we have 
to work two on and one off, with 
ream-out crews busy around the 
clock.” 

“Oh,” the commander said dis- 
appointedly. Then his voice rose 
indignantly as his expression 
hardened. “All research personnel 
will stay on the job until the 
problem is solved. Any man 
caught sleeping before this mat- 
ter is cleared up will be fed into 
the waste ejectors!” 

Baldon backed away saluting 
while Lasson splayed his collar 
wider. 

“The subject, Commander,” 
said a thin voice behind him, “is 
becoming aware.” 

Lasson faced the subordinate. 
“It’s found out — about us?” 

“Oh, no, sir. But it knows some 
force is overriding its will and 
controlling some of its actions.” 
“When did the thing begin sus- 
pecting?” 

“When we tested unit control 
over a few of its organs.” The 
crewman grinned. “It practically 
had a fit when we manipulated its 
arms and hands.” 

Lasson laughed lustily. “How 
did you learn about its reaction?” 
“By sorting through its concept 
field when we hooked in the duo- 
intellectual correlator. The thing’s 
been trying to tell other macro- 
entities that something’s wrong.” 
The subordinate put a hand in 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



front of his mouth to hide his 
snicker. “But nobody will believe 
it!” 

C OMMANDER Lasson’s roars 
of amusement all but rocked 
the compartment “That’s what 
usually happens. On Zerak IV, 
our shock troop not only com- 
pleted the experimental confisca- 
tion, but we also brought almost 
one per cent of the population 
under total control before the rest 
guessed what was happening.” 

“I know,” the crewman said. “I 
was in the advance detail there, 
too. But with the macro-weapons 
we put in the hands of the sub- 
jects, we were able to take over 
completely and dispose of all the 
Zerokians we didn’t need.” 

The compartment blazed with 
light and Lasson turned toward 
the visual-intercept screen. 

Parok was attempting to refine 
the distorted picture that repre- 
sented the entity’s field of vision. 
But the objects in the scene were 
as fuzzily defined as before. 

The commander stood behind 
the psycho-technician and 
watched interestedly. It was ap- 
parent that the thing was back in 
the same compartment where it 
had been when they first tuned 
in on its optical system. Judging 
from the relative position of the 
indistinct articles of furniture, 
Lasson decided it was seated on 
its bunk. 



Squinting to compensate for 
the faulty picture, the comman- 
der tried to discern detail in the 
background — the alternate strips 
of black and white that chal- 
lenged his imagination. 

But the field of vision shifted 
rapidly, frantically. 

Lasson swore and seized, the 
optical coordination controls. “If 
you’re going to use its eyes, use 
them!” 

The scene on the screen stead- 
ied abruptly. 

But two out-of-focus hands 
swept into the field of vision and 
clamped themselves over the 
creature’s eyes. The screen went 
blank. 

“Hit the manual controls!” Las- 
son commanded. 

Parok adjusted two dials and 
the hands fell away again. 

The commander bent forward 
and studied the picture. “We’ve 
got to do better than that. I want 
that myopic effect eliminated 
completely.” 

“It’s their bipartite nature, sir,” 
offered Parok. “Two eyes, two 
arms, two hands, two legs. We’re 
trying to translate from a two- 
value physiology into our own 
three-value specifications. Since 
we’ve got three of everything that 
they have two of — ” 

Lasson cut him short. “It can 
be done. And it won’t take special 
equipment We can convert the 
material on hand.” 



SHOCK TROOP 



119 



T MPULSI VELY, he reached out 
and switched on the auditory- 
intercept circuit. The speaker on 
the console came to life and emit- 
ted a jumble of meaningless vocal 
sounds. It was the creature’s own 
voice— Lasson could tell from the 
way the alien words coincided 
with the vibrations that were 
coming through the walls of the 
compartment. 

He turned on the vocal associa- 
tive counter-transfer and the in- 
terpretive feedback. The mean- 
ingless sounds immediately turned 
into Valvarezian words: 

“Oh (something or other)! Oh 
(something or other)!” 

The concept that failed of 
translation was a single-syllable 
word, apparently invoking or ap- 
pealing to some mythical divinity. 

The entity evidently wasn’t go- 
ing to utter anything except the 
pleading expression. Disgusted, 
Lasson began snapping off 
switches. The screen went dead. 
The speaker’s background sibila- 
tion sputteringly trailed off into 
silence. 

“Commander!” Parok ex- 
claimed, startled. “Listen!” 

“I don’t hear anything.” 
“Exactly! No thrump-thump!” 
Lasson eventually became 
aware of the silence and glanced 
awesomely at the walls. 

“Modification Section’s done it!” 
Parok said exuberantly. “They’ve 
muffled the cross-pulse beat!” 



Throughout the big control 
room, crewmen paused at their 
work to stare in silent wonder at 
the calcified ceiling. 

Now, Lasson thought, if only 
they could take care of the heat 
and the air and the occasional 
convulsions! Then half of his 
shock troop’s mission would be 
accomplished. And they would 
have only the comparatively sim- 
ple task of bringing the macro- 
creature under positive, coordi- 
nated control. 

In the smaller communications 
compartment several shifts later, 
the commander worked doggedly 
to establish a tight beam via sub- 
ether to Valvarez. 

He reported directly to Com- 
missioner of Colonization Survey 
Zemurra, filling him in on prog- 
ress since the expedition had last 
managed contact with the home 
planet. 

But as the report unfolded, 
Lasson got the impression that 
Zemurra was receiving the infor- 
mation somewhat indifferently. 

“But we are doing excellently, 
sir, despite the setbacks,” he has- 
tened to add. 

“Perhaps so,” said the commis- 
sioner. “But I’m disappointed that 
you found it necessary to go so 
far before finding a suitable life- 
form.” 

“I had no control over that. I 
searched until I found what I was 
sent to look for.” 



120 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Z EMURRA was silent a long 
while. “How many men did 
you say you lost?” 

“Only two, sir,” Lasson lied. 
But he could report the other 
twenty-one casualties alter the 
mission succeeded. 

“Very well, then.” The frigid 
voice thawed a bit. “You may 
continue. But you should know 
that three other shock troop units 
have discovered suitable life- 
forms also. And all three of those 
new worlds are less than a tenth 
of the distance from Valvarez 
than the one you’re on.” 

So that was it! No wonder the 
old boy had sounded indifferent. 

“These three life-forms,” Ze- 
murra went on, “exist in abun- 
dance and, as colonial hosts, will 
be adequate for our expansion for 
many, many generations. Nor will 
they ever be a threat, since they 
haven’t developed microbiology. 
We won’t even have to bother 
bringing them under control to 
insure our safety.” 

Lasson grimaced resentfully. 
Damned if he was going to have 
his mission canceled and the 
glory cut out from under him! 

“I’m quite sure, sir,” he said, 
“that the creatures here will serve 
our needs such as no other type 
of host in all our history.” 

“I can see no reason why we 
should extend our operation un- 
necessarily.” 

“But you haven’t seen these 



beings! Each could accommodate 
at least a million Valvarezians. 
There is ample flesh volume, out- 
side of the cranial control area, 
for hundreds of very large resi- 
dential pockets. Every ingredient 
we need exists in abundance in 
millions of capillaries surrounding 
all pocket regions!” 

“As I said before, you may con- 
tinue, seeing that you have gone 
so far. But in view of the other 
developments, I would advise 
against asking for any special 
consideration. The usual policy 
still applies. If there is any pro- 
longed breakdown in communica- 
tions, it will be assumed that your 
shock troop failed its mission and 
must be presumed lost. There will 
be no rescue party. We will write 
your expedition and the new 
planet off as a total loss.” 

“I understand, sir. But we won’t 
fail. You may expect my request 
for the first detachment of colo- 
nists very shortly.” 

“You are that close to success?” 
Zemurra seemed impressed for 
the first time. 

“We have all voluntary motor 
systems hooked in and tested. 
We’re ready to tie them into the 
supplementary auto-reaction cir-

SHOCK TROOP 



The compartment shifted and 
jerked and quivered. Ripples 
raced across the floor and walls. 
Irregular sections of calcite, dis- 
lodged from the ceiling, showered 
down on the communications 
gear. 

Lasson gripped his chair and 
signed off before the commis- 
sioner could question him on the 
unseen commotion. 

TTE SWORE volubly. Either 
the sympathetic-system crew 
would put an end to these damned 
convulsions immediately or they’d 
find themselves stuffed down the 
waste ejector into the capillaries! 

The creature screamed and its 
fists thrashed about in its field of 
vision, beating against a feature- 
less wall. 

Lasson grimly brought the arms 
under control and held them rigid 
against the thing’s side. He im- 
mobilized its legs so it wouldn’t 
complicate matters by dashing 
about. 

Then he concentrated on its 
visual system, twisting the optical 
control dials first in one direction, 
then in another as he studied the 
results on the intercept screen. 

Its bed split into two images 
and the counterparts slipped away 
from each other. He twisted the 
dials in the other direction and 
the reflections meshed into one, 
then slowly drifted apart as be- 
fore. 

122 



Nothing he did, however, would 
make the objects in the back- 
ground stand out any more 
clearly. 

Once more he split the images 
and studied each component 
Fuzziness still enveloped the du- 
plicate items in the background 
of the double picture. The trou- 
ble, apparently, was not focal 
malcoordination between the two 
sight organs. It was, as Parok had 
theorized, a defect inherent in the 
transition from bipartite to tri- 
partite vision. 

Lasson realized the entity was 
still screaming. The wild out- 
bursts were shrilling through the 
audio-intercept speaker and their 
direct vibrations were beating 
thunderously against the com- 
partment walls. 

“Knock it off, Mac!” came a 
different voice through the cir- 
cuit. 

“That’s an old trick,” still an- 
other macro-creature said. “Won’t 
help you any.” 

“But — but something’s happen- 
ing!” the host entity cried des- 
perately. “You got to believe me! 
Oh (something or other)!” 

“Wait till you see what’s going 
to happen!” 

Uproarious laughter from sev- 
eral directions. 

Then: “Somebody shut him 
up!” 

Lasson cut off the audio-inter- 
cept circuit, immobilized the sub- 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ject’s vocal organs and put the 
creature on automatic pace be- 
havior. He returned to the optical 
controls. 

But his efforts were futile. 

T\ ISGUSTED, he leaned back 
and studied the flowing pic- 
ture, absently staring at the light 
and dark pattern in the back- 
ground and curiously trying to 
guess its nature and purpose. It 
was like nothing he’d ever seen 
on Valvarez. 

“Parok!” he called suddenly. 

“Yes, sir?” The psycho-elec- 
tronics chief shuffled dutifully 
across the floor. 

“Where’s the last man who 
worked on the optical-intercept?” 

“Somewhere in a capillary,” 
Parok replied dismally, “as you 
ordered, sir.” 

The commander made a ges- 
ture of annoyance. “Well, see that 
the man who’s working on it now 
joins him, and put another on the 
job.” 

“At this rate, sir,” Parok offered 
uncertainly, “I won’t have any 
section personnel left. Have you 
considered using a detention 
method — like the natives on Cer- 
via IX did?” 

“Detention? What’s that?” 

“When a subordinate does 
something wrong, you lock him 
up. If you need him later, he’s 
still there.” 

“Inefficient A waste of time, 



food and room.” He dismissed 
Parok with a flick of his hand. 
“March the man to the injectors.” 

There was a blinding flash 
from somewhere behind the con- 
trol console and a chorus of agon- 
ized yells trailed off into short- 
lived moans. 

“I think that will be quite im- 
possible now, sir,” Parok said 
hopelessly. 

It was. Lasson had to detach a 
special detail to carry the man in 
question, together with the other 
two who were in contact with him 
when he absorbed the two micro- 
amps of electric current, to the 
injectors. 

By the end of the next few 
shifts, quite a remarkable change 
had come over the control com- 
partment Every feature of the 
“new order” reflected impending 
success of the shock troop’s mis- 
sion. 

To begin with, there was a 
subtle undercurrent of victory in 
the attitude of the men. Whereas 
before they had seemed uncertain 
and apprehensive, they were now 
cocky and spirited. 

Lasson complimented himself 
on having done a good job, both 
on the men and on the macro- 
entity. 

The compartment now pre- 
sented a homy appearance. Speak- 
ers on the walls filled the room 
with soft Valvarezian music. Cool 
breezes, artificially scented with 



SMOCK TROOP 



123 



the redolence of saran blossoms, 
fanned out from the air ducts. 

The floor was smoothly paved 
with a new layer of calcite that 
had remained undisturbed by 
convulsive upheavals for several 
shifts. And the cross-pulse beat 
had been deadened until the 
thrump-thump was but a eupho- 
nious rhythmic accompaniment to 
the soothing symphony. 

Lounging chairs were now part 
of the furnishings, and frescoes 
that strummed nostalgic chords 
in the hearts of the men deco- 
rated the walls. 

t' VEN the stem and redoubt- 
able Commander Lasson 
seemed less out of sorts as he 
hummed his harmonic obbligato 
to the music. His stubby fingers 
beat out the tempo on the console 
keyboard while he absently moni- 
tored the visual-intercept screen, 
putting the creature through a se- 
ries of coordination exercises. 

Parok sat in the co-controller’s 
chair, manipulating switches and 
experimenting with the macro- 
being’s facial expressions and 
semi-automatic gestures. 

“Handles rather nicely, doesn’t 
it?” Lasson asked civilly. 

"As well as any we’ve ever 
brought under permanent con- 
trol,” Parok agreed. 

‘The commissioner will find it 
impossible to reject this life-form. 
It’s ideally suited to our needs. 

124 



I’m sure Zemurra will withdraw 
the colonists from all other worlds 
and assign them to hosts on this 
planet.” 

The commander put the sub- 
ject on full automatic pace and 
sat back contentedly. 

“Well, that finishes it up,” he 
said, slapping his palms against 
his thighs. “Of course, we haven’t 
been able to correct the optical 
relay defect, but that doesn’t mat- 
ter. The vision is well within 
specifications.” 

He cast one final wistful glance 
at the provocative light-dark ver- 
tical pattern in the background of 
the thing’s vision, shrugged fu- 
tilely and buzzed the communica- 
tions section chief on the inter- 
com. 

“I want you to prepare an offi- 
cial sub-ethergram to the commis- 
sioner,” he instructed. “Say, ‘Your 
Excellency: Test Project Twenty- 
eight complete and ready for 
colonization. Residential pocket 
prepared for first ten thousand 
colonists. All conditions ideal- 
plus. Dispatch shock troop units 
to bring next one hundred thou- 
sand host entities under positive 
control.’ 

“When you have the message 
taped, bring it here for authenti- 
cation before you send it.” 

Lasson rose from the control 
chair momentarily and slipped on 
the kinesthetic relay suit. He 
tugged at the creases until it fit 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



snugly, then plugged in its leads. 

The kinesthetic circuit warmed 
up to operational potential and 
abruptly he was as one with the 
macro-entity. Now he was aware 
of all its external sensations — the 
position of its limbs, the warm air 
on its skin, the slump of its 
shoulders. 

It was disconcerting at first, of 
course. Most difficult of all was 
getting used to the vicarious sen- 
sations of walking on two legs, 
manipulating objects with only 
two hands. 

r T , HE commander tensed. Some- 
-*• thing was wrong. The thing 
felt different from the last time 
he had tapped in on its kinesthe- 
tic system. There was a — chilli- 
ness somewhere. 

Parok gestured tpward the big 
screen. 

Other macro-creatures were in 
the room with the host now. One, 
dressed in some sort of a dark 
robe, stood in front of the subject 
and read from a small black 
book. The vocalization came 
promptly through the audio-inter- 
cept speaker: 

“Something or other. Some- 
thing or other. Something or—” 

It was all very confusing. The 
vocal associative counter-transfer 
was failing to translate anything 
the black-robed creature was say- 
ing. 

It was as though the being 



was speaking a language totally 
alien to the host. 

Tentatively, Lasson raised the 
subject’s hand to the top of its 
head. No wonder there was the 
sensation of cold! The mat of 
threadlike growth had been re- 
moved! 

The commander glanced un- 
certainly over at Parok. But the 
subordinate only shrugged hope- 
lessly, indicating his inability to 
guess at what was transpiring on 
the screen. 

Presently Lasson received the 
sensation of strong hands seizing 
the host entity’s arms and tugging 
him toward the puzzling pattern 
of vertical stripes. 

He started to manipulate the 
controls and make the subject 
break free, but then he realized 
the resistance might overload the 
circuits. So he put the creature on 
semi-automatic and let it submis- 
sively go along with the others. 

The incongruous striped pat- 
tern swam closer and came into 
focus as the party approached it 
Lasson could discern now that it 
was a series of lathlike strips of 
metal spaced at short intervals 
and extending from the floor to 
the ceiling. 

The creature and those with it 
went through an aperture in the 
pattern and down a corridor into 
a small, bare room. 

All the sensations were trans- 
mitted to Lasson through the kin- 






SHOCK TROOP 



125 



esthetic relay circuit as the entity 
was lowered into a stiff chair and 
bands were clamped tightly 
around its wrists and ankles. 

Intrigued, the commander 
made the subject glance up in 
time to see a dome-shaped metal 
object being lowered over its 
bare head. 

It was an uncomfortably cold 
thing and Lasson tried to raise 
the creature’s hands to snatch it 
away, forgetting that the sub- 



ject was, for some reason, 
shackled. 

For a brief instant, the com- 
mander closed his eyes and tried 
to visualize, in true perspective, 
the great cupola in the macro- 
world as it almost completely en- 
cased the brain and its network 
of Valvarezian tunnels and com- 
partments and crewmen. 

Then he waited interestedly to 
see what would happen next.

FORECAST 



Instead of merely having the usual brain-wave dips and curves, the 
electroencephalograph of a sunny blond Viking like Poul Anderson must 
consist of dour storm-scoured peaks and mystery-black valleys . like 
those that landscape A WORLD CALLED MAANEREK, next month's novella. 
The planet itself is darkly adventurous enough, but Anderson sets down in 
it a man recklessly striving to escape an even darker enigma: What are 
the forgotten memories that eat at the rim of his mind? Are they why he 
looks and feels so unlike his people? He knows there are answers . but 
they are not inside him! 

Despite its grim-sounding title, Robert Sheckley's novelet, THE DEATHS 
OF BEN BAXTER, is a perfect contrast. The breath of an entire population 
literally hangs upon whether Ben Baxter lives or dies . and he infuriat- 
ingly refuses to stay alive! 

Along with perhaps another novelest and certainly short stories and 
our regular features, Willy Ley has a genuinely startling report to make 
. THE MOON CONTRACT exists right now! No, it's not a con game for 
starry-eyed speculators. It has nothing to do with lunar real estate or 
mining concessions or, for that matter, anything you are likely to guess 
. because it has nothing whatever to do with the Moon. Yet the contract 
exists as an actual legal document, with the most solid and solvent finan- 
cial, political, military and scientific backing possible. Don't lie awake 
nights wondering; read the astonishing details in next month's issue. Of 
course we know this is a deliberate tease and that you hate us for it, but 
the purpose of a Forecast is to sell copies, isn't it? We promise you won't 
be disappointed.

Confidence Game 

By JIM HARMON 



I admit it: I didn't know if I was coming or 
going— but I know that if I stuck to the old 
man, I was a comer . even if he was a gonerl 



Illustrated by EPSTEIN 



D OC had this solemn hu- 
man by the throat when 
I caught up with him. 
“Tonight,” Doc was saying in 
his old voice that was as crackled 
and important as parchment, “to- 
night Man will reach the Moon. 
The golden Moon and the silver 
ship, symbols of greed. Tonight is 
the night when this is to happen.” 
“Sure,” the man agreed se- 
verely, prying a little worriedly 
at Doc’s arthritic fingers that 
were clamped on his collar. “No 
argument. Sure, up we go. But 
leave me go or, so help me, I’ll 
fetch you one in the teeth!” 

I came alongside and carefully 
started to lever the old man 
loose, one finger at a time. It had 
to be done this way. I had learned 
that during all these weeks and 

128 



months. His hands looked old and 
crippled, but I felt they were the 
strongest in the world. If a half 
dozen winos in Seattle hadn’t 
helped me get them loose, Doc 
and I would have been wanted 
for the murder of a North Ameri- 
can Mountie. 

It was easier this night and 
that made me afraid. Doc’s thin 
frame, layered with lumpy fat, 
was beginning to muscle-dance 
against my side. One of his times 
was coming on him. Then at last 
he was free of the greasy collar of 
the human. 

“I hope you’ll forgive him, sir,” 
I said, not meeting the man’s 
eyes. “He’s my father and very 
old, as you can see.” I laughed in- 
side at the absurd, easy lie. “Old 
events seem recent to him.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




CONFIDENCE GAME 



The human nodded, Adam’s 
apple jerking in the angry neon 
twilight. ‘“Memory Jump,’ you 
mean. All my great-grandfathers 
have it. But Great-great-grand- 
mother Lupos, funny thing, is like 
a schoolgirl. Sharp, you know. 
I. Say, the poor old guy looks 
sick. Want any help?” 

I told the human no, thanks, 
and walked Doc toward the flop- 
house three doors down. I hoped 
we would make it. I didn’t know 
what would happen if we didn’t. 
Doc was liable to say something 
that might nova Sol, for all I 
knew. 

M ARTIANS approaching the 
corner were sensing at Doc 
and me. They were just cheap 
tourists slumming down on Skid 
Row. I hated tourists and espe- 
cially I hated Martian tourists 
because I especially hated Mar- 
tians. They were aliens. They 
were’t men like Doc and me. 

Then I realized what was about 
to happen. It was foolish and aw- 
ful and true. I was going to have 
one of mine at the same time Doc 
was having his. That was bad. It 
had happened a few times right 
after I first found him, but now it 
was worse. For some undefinable 
reason, I felt we kept getting 
closer each of the times. 

I tried not to think about it 
and helped Doc through the fly- 
specked flophouse doors.

The tubercular clerk looked up 
from the gaudy comics sections 
of one of those little tabloids that 
have the funnies a week in ad- 
vance. 

“Fifteen cents a bed,” he said 
mechanically. 

“We’ll use one bed,” I told him. 
“I’ll give you twenty cents.” I 
felt the round hard quarter in my 
pocket, sweaty hand against sticky 
lining. 

“Fifteen cents a bed,” he played 
it back for me. 

Doc was quivering against me, 
his legs boneless. 

“We can always make it over 
to the mission,” I lied. 

The clerk turned his upper lip 
as if he were going to spit. “Aw- 
right, since we ain’t full up. In 
advance.” 

I placed the quarter on the 
desk. 

“Give me a nickel.” 

The clerk’s hand fell on the 
coin and slid it off into the un- 
known before I could move, what 
with holding up Doc. 

“You’ve got your nerve,” he 
said at me with a fine mist of 
dew. “Had a quarter all along and 
yet you Martian me down to 
twenty cents.” He saw the look 
on my face. “I’ll give you a room 
for the two bits. That’s better’n 
a bed for twenty.” 

I knew I was going to need 
that nickel. Desperately. I reached 
across the desk with my free 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



hand and hauled the scrawny hu- 
man up against the register hard. 
I’m not as strong in my hands as 
Doc, but I managed. 

“Give me a nickel,” I said. 

“What nickel?” His eyes were 
big, but they kept looking right 
at me. “You don’t have any 
nickel. You don’t have any quar- 
ter, not if I say so. Want I should 
call a cop and tell him you were 
flexing a muscle?” 

I let go of him. He didn’t scare 
me, but Doc was beginning to 
mumble and that did scare me. I 
had to get him alone. 

“Where’s the room?” I asked. 

HT HE room was six feet in all 
directions and the walls were 
five feet high. The other foot 
was finished in chicken wire. 
There was a wino singing on the 
left, a wino praying on the right, 
and the door didn’t have any lock 
on it At last, Doc and I were 
alone. 

I laid Doc out on the gray- 
brown cot and put his forearm 
over his face to shield it some 
from the glare of the light bulb. 
I swept off all the bedbugs in 
sight and stepped on them heav- 
ily. 

Then I dropped down into the 
painted stool chair and let my 
burning eyes rest on the obscene 
wall drawings just to focus them. 
I was so dirty, I could feel the 
grime grinding together all over 



me. My shaggy scalp still smarted 
from the alcohol I had stolen 
from a convertible’s gas tank to 
get rid of Doc’s and my cooties. 
Lucky that I never needed to 
shave and that my face was so 
dirty, no one would even notice 
that I didn’t need to. 

The cramp hit me and I folded 
out of the chair onto the littered, 
uncovered floor. 

It stopped hurting, but I knew 
it would begin if I moved. I 
stared at a jagged cut-out nude 
curled against a lump of dust and 
lint, giving it an unreal distortion. 

Doc began to mumble louder. 

I knew I had to move. 

I waited just a moment, savor- 
ing the painless peace. Then, fi- 
nally, I moved. 

I was bent double, but I got 
from the floor to the chair and 
found my notebook and orb-point 
in my hands. I found I couldn’t 
focus both my mind and my eyes 
through the electric flashes of 
agony, so I concentrated on Doc s 
voice and trusted my hands 
would follow their habit pattern 
and construct the symbols for his 
words. They were suddenly dis- 
tinguishable. 

“ Outsider . Thoth. Dyzan . 
Seven. Hsan. Beyond Six, 
Seven, Eight. Two boxes.

Jimmy Christopher. Kent Al- 
lard. Ayem. Oh, are. 



CONFIDENCE GAME

TTIS voice rose to a meaning- 
ness wail that stretched into 
non-existence. The pen slid across 
the scribbled face of the notebook 
and both dropped from my numb 
hands. But I knew. Somehow, in- 
side me, 1 knew that these words 
were what I had been waiting for. 
They told everything I needed to 
know to become the most power- 
ful man in the Solar Federation. 

That wasn’t just an addict’s 
dream. I knew who Doc was. 
When I got to thinking it was just 
a dream and that I was dragging 
this old man around North 
America for nothing, I remem- 
bered who he was. 

I remembered that he was 
somebody very important whose 
name and work I had once 
known, even if now I knew him 
only as Doc. 

Pain was a pendulum within 
me, swinging from low throbbing 
bass to high screaming tenor. I 
had to get out and get some. But 
I didn’t have a nickel. Still, I had 
to get some. 

I crawled to the door and 
raised myself by the knob, slick 
with greasy dirt. The door opened 
and shut — there was no lock. I 
shouldn’t leave Doc alone, but I 
had to. 

He was starting to cry. He 
didn’t always do that 

I listened to him for a moment 
then tested and tasted the craving 
that crawled through my veins. I 

132 



got back inside somehow. 

Doc was twisting on the cot, 
tears washing white streaks across 
his face. I shoved Doc’s face up 
against my chest. I held onto him 
and let him bellow. I soothed the 
lanks of soiled white hair back 
over his lumpy skull. 

He shut up at last and I laid 
him down again and put his arm 
back across his face. (You can’t 
turn the light off and on in places 
like that. The old wiring will 
blow the bulb half the time.) 

I don’t remember how I got 
out onto the street. 

CHE was pink and clean and 
^ her platinum hair was pulled 
straight back, drawing her cheek- 
bones tighter, straightening her 
wide; appealing mouth, drawing 
her lean, athletic, feminine body 
erect. She was wearing a powder- 
blue dress that covered all of her 
breasts and hips and the upper 
half of her legs. 

The most wonderful thing 
about her was her perfume. Then 
I realized it wasn’t perfume, only 
the scent of soap. Finally, I knew 
it wasn’t that It was just healthy, 
fresh-scrubbed skin. 

I went to her at the bus stop, 
forcing my legs not to stagger. 
Nobody would help a drunk. I 
don’t know why, but nobody will 
help you if they think you are 
blotto. 

“Ma’am, could you help a man 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



who’s not had work?” I kept my 
eyes down. I couldn’t look a hu- 
man in the eye and ask for help. 
“Just a dime for a cup of coffee.” 
I knew where I could get it for 
three cents, maybe two and a 
half. 

I felt her looking at me. She 
spoke in an educated voice, one 
she used, perhaps, as a teacher or 
supervising telephone operator. 
“Do you want it for coffee, or to 
apply, or a glass or hypo of some- 
thing else?” 

I cringed and whined. She 
would expect it of me. I suddenly 
realized that anybody as clean as 
she was had to be a tourist here. 
I hate tourists. 

“Just coffee, ma’am.” She was 
younger than I was, so I didn’t 
have to call her that. “A little 
more for food, if you could spare 
it” 

I hadn’t eaten in a day and 
a half, but I didn’t care much. 

“I’ll buy you a dinner,” she 
said carefully, “provided I can go 
with you and see for myself that 
you actually eat it” 

I felt my face flushing red. 
“You wouldn’t want to be seen 
with a bum like me, ma’am.” 

“I’ll be seen with you if you 
really want to eat” 

It was certainly unfair and 
probably immoral. But I had no 
choice whatever. 

“Okay,” I said, tasting bitter- 
ness over the craving. 



r T 1 HE coffee was in a thick 
white cup before me on the 
counter. It was pale, grayish 
brown and steaming faintly. I 
picked it up in both hands to 
feel its warmth. 

Out of the comer of my eye, I 
could see the woman sitting on 
the stool beside me. She had no 
right to intrude. This moment 
should be mine, but there she 
sat, marring it for me, a con- 
temptible tourist. 

I gulped down the thick, dark 
liquid brutally. It was all I could 
do. The cramp flowed out of my 
diaphragm. I took another swal- 
low and was able to think straight 
again. A third swallow and I 
felt — good. Not abnormally stim- 
ulated, but strong, alert, poised on 
the brink of exhilaration. 

That was what coffee did for 
me. 

I was a caffeine addict. 

Earth-norm humans sometimes 
have the addiction to a slight ex- 
tent, but I knew that as a Cen- 
turian I had it infinitely worse. 
Caffeine affected my metabolism 
like a pure alkaloid. The immedi- 
ate effects weren’t the same, but 
the need ran as deep. 

I finished the cup. I didn’t or- 
der another because I wasn’t a 
pure sensualist I just needed re- 
lease. Sometimes, when I didn’t 
have the price of a cup, I would 
look around in alleys and find 
cola bottles with a few drops left

in them. They have a little caf- 
feine in them — not enough, never 
enough, but better than nothing. 

“Now what do you want to 
eat?” the woman asked. 

I didn’t look at her. She didn’t 
know. She thought I was a human 
— an Earth human. I was a man, 
of course, not an alien like a Mar- 
tian. Earthmen ran the whole 
Solar Federation, but I was just 
as good as an Earthman. With 
my suntan and short mane, I 
could pass, couldn’t I? That 
proved it, didn’t it? 

“Hamburger,” I said. “Well 
done.” I knew that would prob- 
ably be all they had fit to eat at 
a place like this. It might be 
horse meat, but then I didn’t have 
the local prejudices. 

I didn’t look at the woman. I 
couldn’t. But I kept remembering 
how clean she looked and I was 
aware of how clean she smelled. 
I was so dirty, so very dirty that 
I could never get clean if I 
bathed every hour for the rest of 
my life. 

The hamburger was engulfed 
by five black-crowned, broken 
fingernails and raised to two rows 
of yellow ivory. I surrounded it 
like an ameba, almost in a single 
movement of my jaws. 

Several other hamburgers fol- 
lowed the first. I lost count. I 
drank a glass of milk. I didn’t 
want to black out on coffee with 
Doc waiting for me.

“Could I have a few to take 
with me, miss?” I pleaded. 

She smiled. I caught that out 
of the edge of my vision, but 
mostly I just felt it 

“That’s the first time you’ve 
called me anything but ‘ma’am.’” 
she said. “I’m not an old-maid 
schoolteacher, you know.” 

That probably meant she was 
a schoolteacher, though. “No, 
miss,” I said. 

“It’s Miss Casey — Vivian 
Casey,” she corrected. She was a 
schoolteacher, all right. No other 
girl would introduce herself as 
Miss Last Name. Then there was 
something in her voice. 

“What’s your name?” she said 
to me. 

I choked a little on a bite of 
stale bun. 

I had a name, of course. 

I 1 VERYBODY has a name, 
and I knew if I went off 
somewhere quiet and thought 
about it, mine would come to me. 
Meanwhile, I would tell the girl 
that my name was . Kevin 
O’Malley. Abruptly I realized 
that that was my name. 

“Kevin,” I told her. “John 
Kevin.” 

“Mister Kevin,” she said, her 
words dancing with bright ab- 
surdity like waterhose mist on a 
summer afternoon, “I wonder if 
you could help me.” 

“Happy to, miss,” I mumbled.

She pushed a white rectangle 
in front of me on the painted 
maroon bar. “What do you think 
of this?” 

I looked at the piece of paper. 
It was a coupon from a magazine. 



Dear Acolyte R. /. S.: 

Please send me FREE of obliga- 
tion, in sealed wrapper, "The Scar- 
let Book " revealing to me how I

The world disoriented itself 
and I was on the floor of the 
somber diner and Miss Vivian 
Casey was out of sight and scent. 

There was a five dollar bill 
tight in my fist. The counterman 
was trying to pull it out. 

I looked up at his stubbled 
face. “I had half a dozen ham- 
burgers, a cup of coffee and a 
glass of milk. I want four more 
’burgers to go and a pint of cof- 
fee. By your prices, that will be 
one sixty-five — if the lady didn’t 
pay you.” 

“She didn’t,” he stammered. 
“Why do you think I was trying 
to get that bill out of your hand?” 

I didn’t say anything, just got 
up off the floor. After the coun- 
terman put down my change, I 
spread out the five dollar bill on 



the vacant bar, smoothing it 
I scooped up my change and 
walked out the door. There was 
no one on the sidewalk, only in 
the doorways. 

F IRST I opened the door on an 
amber world, then an azure 
one. Neon light was coming from 
the chickenwire border of the 
room, from a window somewhere 
beyond. The wino on one side of 
the room was singing and the one 
on the other side was praying, 
same as before. Only they had 
changed around — prayer came 
from the left song from the right. 

Doc sat on the floor in the half- 
darkness and he had made a 
thing. 

My heart hammered at my 
lungs. I knew this last time had 
been different. Whatever it was 
was getting closer. This was the 
first time Doc had ever made 
anything. It didn’t look like much, 
but it was a start. 

He had broken the light bulb 
and used the filament and screw 
bottom. His strong hands had un- 
raveled some of the bed “springs” 
— metal webbing — and fashioned 
them to his needs. My orb-point 
pen had dissolved under his 
touch. All of them, useless parts, 
were made into a meaningful 
whole. 

I knew the thing had meaning, 
but when I tried to follow its de- 
sign, I became lost.

CONFIDENCE GAME 



I put the paper container of 
warm coffee and the greasy bag 
of hamburgers on the wooden 
chair, hoping the odor wouldn’t 
bring any hungry rats out of the 
walls. 

I knelt beside Doc. 

“An order, my boy, an order,” 
he whispered. 

I didn’t know what he meant. 
Was he suddenly trying to give 
me orders? 

He held something out to me. 
It was my notebook. He had used 
my pen, before dismantling it, to 
write something. I tilted the note- 
book against the neon light, now 



red wine, now fresh grape. I 
read it 

“Concentrate,” Doc said hoarse- 
ly. “Concentrate. .** 

I wondered what the words 
meant. Wondering takes a kind 
of concentration. 

The words “First Edition” were 
what I was thinking about most. 

HE heavy-set man in the or- * 
nate armchair was saying, 
“The bullet struck me as I was 
pulling on my boot. .” * 

I was kneeling on the floor of 
a Victorian living room. I’m quite 
familiar with Earth history and I

recognized the period immedi- 
ately. 

Then I realized what I had 
been trying to get from Doc all 
these months — time travel. 

A thin, sickly man was sprawled 
in the other chair in a rumpled 
dressing gown. My eyes held to 
his face, his pinpoint pupils and 
whitened nose. He was a con- 
demned snowbird! If there was 
anything I hated or held in more 
contempt than tourists or Mar- 
tians, it was a snowbird. 

“My clients have occasioned 
singular methods of entry into 
these rooms,” the thin man re- 



marked, “but never before have 
they used instantaneous materi- 
alization.” 

The heavier man was half 
choking, half laughing. “I say — I 
say, I would like to see you ex- 
plain this, my dear fellow.” 

“I have no data,” the thin man 
answered coolly. “In such in- 
stance, one begins to twist theo- 
ries into fact, or facts into theo- 
ries. I must ask this unemployed, 
former professional man who has 
gone through a serious illness and 
is suffering a more serious addic- 
tion to tell me the place and time 
from which he comes.”

The surprise stung. “How did 
you know?” I asked. 

He gestured with a pale hand. 
“To maintain a logical approach, 

I must reject the supernatural. 
Your arrival, unless hallucinatory 
— and despite my voluntary use of 
one drug and my involuntary ex- 
periences recently with another, I 
must accept the evidence of my 
senses or retire from my profes- 
sion— your arrival was then su- 
per-normal. I might say super-sci- 
entific, of a science not of my or 
the good doctor’s time, clearly. 
Time travel is a familiar folk leg- 
end and I have been reading an 
article by the entertaining Mr. 
Wells. Perhaps he will expand it 
into one of his novels of scientific 
romance.” 

I knew who these two men 
were, with a tormenting doubt. 
“But the other—” 

“Your hands, though unclean, 
have never seen physical labor. 
Your cranial construction is of a 
superior type, or even if you re- 
ject my theories, concentration 
does set the facial features. I 
judge you have suffered an ill- 
ness because of the inhibition of 
your beard growth. Your over- 
fondness for rum or opium, per- 
haps, is self-evident. You are at 
too resilient an age to be so sunk 
by even an amour. Why else then 
would you let yourself fall into 
such an underfed and unsanitary 
state?” 

1M 



H E WAS so smug and so sure, 
this snowbird. I hated him. 
Because I couldn’t trust to my 
own senses as he did. 

“You don’t exist,” I said slowly, 
painfully. “You are fictional crea- 
tions.” 

The doctor flushed darkly. 
“You give my literary agent too 
much credit for the addition of 
professional polish to my works.” 
The other man was filling a 
large, curved pipe from some- 
thing that looked vaguely like an 
ice-skate. ‘Interesting. Perhaps if 
our visitor would tell us some- 
thing of his age with special ref- 
erence to the theory and practice 
of temporal transference, Doctor, 
we would be better equipped to 
judge whether we exist.” 

There was no theory or prac- 
tice of time travel. I told them all 
I had ever heard theorized from 
Hindu yoga through Extra-sen- 
sory Perception to Relativity and 
the positron and negatron. 

“Interesting.” He breathed out 
suffocating black clouds of smoke. 
“Presume that the people of your 
time by their ‘Extra-sensory Per- 
ception’ have altered the past to 
make it as they suppose it to be. 
The great historical figures are 
made the larger than life-size that 
we know them. The great literary 
creations assume reality.” 

I thought of Cleopatra and 
Helen of Troy and wondered if 
they would be the goddesses of 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



love that people imagined or the 
scrawny, big-nosed redhead and 
fading old woman of scholarship. 
Then I noticed the detective’s 
hand that had been resting idly 
on a round brass weight of un- 
known sort to me. His tapered 
fingertips had indented the metal. 

His bright eyes followed mine 
and he smiled faintly. “With- 
drawal symptoms.” 

The admiration and affection 
for this man that had been slowly 
building up behind my hatred un- 
brinked. I remembered now that 
he had stopped. He was not really 
a snowbird. 

After a time, I asked the doctor 
a question. 

“Why, yes. I’m flattered. This 
is the first manuscript. Consider- 
ing my professional handwriting, 
I recopied it more laboriously.” 

Accepting the sheaf of papers 
and not looking back at these 
two great and good men, I con- 
centrated on my own time and 
Doc. Nothing happened. My heart 
raced, but I saw something danc- 
ing before me like a dust mote in 
sunlight and stepped toward it. 

. into the effective range of 
Miss Casey’s tiny gun. 

CHE inclined the lethal silver 
^ toy. “Let me see those papers, 
Kevin.” 

I handed her the doctor’s manu- 
script. 

Her breath escaped slowly and 

CONFIDENCE GAME 



loudly. “It’s all right. It’s all right. 
It exists. It’s real. Not even one 
of the unwritten ones. I’ve read 
this myself.” 

Doc was lying on the cot, half 
his face twisted into horror. 

“Don’t move, Kevin,” she said. 
“I’ll have to shoot you — maybe 
not to kill, but painfully.” 

I watched her face flash blue, 
red, blue and knew she meant it 
But I had known too much in too 
short a time. I had to help Doc, 
but there was something else. 

“I just want a drink of coffee 
from that container on the chair,” 
I told her. 

She shook her head. “I don’t 
know what you think it does to 
you.” 

It was getting hard for me to 
think. “Who are you?” 

She showed me a card from her 
wrist purse. Vivian Casey, Con- 
stable, North American Mounted 
Police. 

I had to help Doc. I had to 
have some coffee. “What do you 
want?” 

“Listen, Kevin. Listen carefully 
to what I am saying. Doc found a 
method of time travel. It was al- 
most a purely mathematical, top- 
ographical way divorced from 
modern physical sciences. He 
kept it secret and he wanted to 
make money with it. He was an 
idealist — he had his crusades. 
How can you make money with 
time travel?” 

139 




I didn’t know whether she was 
asking me, but I didn’t know. All 
I knew was that I had to help 
Doc and get some coffee. 

“It takes money — money Doc 
didn’t have — to make money,” 
Miss Casey said, “even if you 
know what horse will come in 
and what stock will prosper. Be- 
sides, horse-racing and the stock 
market weren’t a part of Doc’s 
character. He was a scholar.” 

Why did she keep using the 
past tense in reference to Doc? It 
scared me. He was lying so still 
with the left side of his face so 
twisted. I needed some coffee. 

140 



“He became a book finder. He 
got rare editions of books and 
magazines for his clients in abso- 
lutely mint condition. That was 
all right — until he started obtain- 
ing books that did not exist.” 

T DIDN’T know what all that 

was supposed to mean. I 
got to the chair, snatched up the 
coffee container, tore it open and 
gulped down the soothing liquid. 

I turned toward her and threw 
the rest of the coffee into her 
face. 

The coffee splashed out over 
her platinum hair and powder- 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





blue dress that looked white 
when the neon was azure, purple 
when it was amber. The coffee 
stained and soiled and ruined, 
and I was fiercely glad, unrea- 
sonable happy. 

I tore the gun away from her 
by the short barrel, not letting my 
filthy hands touch her scrubbed 
pink ones. 

I pointed the gun generally at 
her and backed around the thing 
on the floor to the cot Doc had 
a pulse, but it was irregular. I 
checked for a fever and there 
wasn’t one. After that I didn’t 
know what to do. 



I looked up finally and saw a 
Martian in or about the doorway. 

“Call me Andre,” the Martian 
said. “A common name but for- 
eign. It should serve as a point 
of reference.” 

I had always wondered how a 
thing like a Martian could talk. 
Sometimes I wondered if they 
really could. 

“You won’t need the gun,” 
Andre said conversationally. 

“I’ll keep it thanks. What do 
you want?” 

“I’ll begin as Miss Casey did — 
by telling you things. Hundreds 
of people disappeared from North 



CONFIDENCE GAME 



Ml 



America a few months ago.” 
“They always do,” I told him. 
“They ceased to exist — as hu- 
man beings — shortly after they 
received a book from Doc,” the 
Martian said. 

Something seemed to strike me 
in the back of the neck. I stag- 
gered, but managed to hold onto 
the gun and stand up. 

“Use one of those sneaky Mar- 
tian weapons again,” I warned 
him, “and I’ll kill the girl.” Mar- 
tians were supposed to be against 
the destruction of any life-form, I 
had read someplace. I doubted it, 
but it was worth a try. 

“Kevin,” Andre said, "why don’t 
you take a bath?” 

The Martian weapon staggered 
me again. I tried to say some- 
thing. I tried to explain that I was 
so dirty that I could never get 
clean no matter how often I 
bathed. No words formed. 

“But, Kevin,” Andre said, “you 
aren’t that dirty.” 

r T , HE blow shook the gun from 
my fingers. It almost fell into 
the thing on the floor, but at the 
last moment seemed to change di- 
rection and miss it. 

I knew something. “I don’t 
wash because I drink coffee.” 
“It’s all right to drink coffee, 
isn’t it?” he asked. 

“Of course,” I said, and added 
absurdly, “That’s why I don’t 
wash.” 



“You mean,” Andre said slowly, 
ploddingly, “that if you bathed, 
you would be admitting that 
drinking coffee was in the same 
class as any other solitary vice 
that makes people wash fre- 
quently.” 

I was knocked to my knees. 

“Kevin,” the Martian said, 
“drinking coffee represents a ma- 
jor voice only in Centurian hu- 
manoids, not Earth-norm human 
beings. Which are you?” 

Nothing came out of my gab- 
bling mouth. 

“What is Doc’s full name?” 

I almost fell in, but at the last 
instant I caught myself and said, 
“Doctor Kevin O’Malley, Senior.” 

From the bed, Doc said a word. 
“Son.” 

Then he disappeared. 

I looked at that which he had 
made. I wondered where he had 
gone, in search of what. 

“He didn’t use that,” Andre 
said. 

So I was an Earthman, Doc’s 
son. So my addiction to coffee 
was all in my mind. That didn’t 
change anything. They say sex is 
all in your mind. I didn’t want to 
be cured. I wouldn’t be. Doc was 
gone. That was all I had now. 
That and the thing he left. 

“The rest is simple,” Andre 
said. “Doc O’Malley bought up 
all the stock in a certain ancient 
metaphysical order and started 
supplying members with certain 



142 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



books. Can you imagine the ef- 
fect of the Book of Dyzan or the 
Book of Thoth or the Seven Cryp- 
tical Books of Hsan or the Necro- 
nomican itself on human beings?” 

“But they don’t exist,” I said 
wearily. 

“Exactly, Kevin, exactly. They 
have never existed any more than 
your Victorian detective friend. 
But the unconscious racial mind 
has reached back into time and 
created them. And that uncon- 
scious mind, deeper than psychol- 
ogy terms the subconscious, has 
always known about the powers 
of ESP, telepathy, telekinesis, pre- 
cognition. Through these books, 
the human race can tell itself how 
to achieve a state of pure logic, 
without food, without sex, without 
conflict — just as Doc has 
achieved such a state — a little 
late, true. He had a powerful guilt 
complex, even stronger than your 
withdrawal, over releasing this 
blessing on the inhabited uni- 
verse, but reason finally pre- 
vailed. He had reached a state of 
pure thought.” 

“The North American govern- 
ment has to have this secret, 
Kevin,” the girl said. “You can’t 
let it fall into the hands of the 
Martians.” 

A NDRE did not deny that he 
wanted it to fall into his 
hands. 

I knew I could not let Doc’s — 

CONFIDENCE GAME 



Dad’s — time travel thing fall into 
anyone’s hands. I remembered 
that all the copies of the books 
had disappeared with their read- 
ers now. There must not be any 
more, I knew. 

Miss Casey did her duty and 
tried to stop me with a judo hold, 
but I don’t think her heart was in 
it, because I reversed and broke it. 

I kicked the thing to pieces and 
stomped on the pieces. Maybe 
you can’t stop the progress of 
science, but I knew it might be 
millenniums before Doc’s genes 
and creative environment were 
recreated and time travel was re- 
discovered. Maybe we would be 
ready for it then. I knew we 
weren’t now. 

Miss Casey leaned against my 
dirty chest and cried into it I 
didn’t mind her touching me. 

“I'm glad,” she said. 

Andre flowed out of the door- 
way with a sigh. Of relief? 

I would never know. I sup- 
posed I had destroyed it because 
I didn’t want the human race to 
become a thing of pure reason 
without purpose, direction or love, 
but I would never know for sure. 

I thought I could kick the habit 

— perhaps with Miss Casey’s help 

— but I wasn’t really confident 

Maybe I had destroyed the 

time machine because a wojW- "

are as thoroughly domesticated as 
the dog) are a special case — it is 
as though an American child were 
brought up in Babylon; he would 
undoubtedly learn to communi- 
cate, but it would be in Babylo- 
nian terms and not in the lan- 
guage he had been born to.” 

Pohl refers to a dog named 
Fellow, “an honored guest at Co- 
lumbia University (who) had a 
vocabulary in English of four 
hundred words, which he recog- 
nized regardless of who spoke 
them.” But Pohl dismisses Dog as 
contaminated with Human. 

However, he says, “Cat might 
be purer — some 15 words of Cat 
have been identified, along with 
some six words of Horse and a 
few each of Elephant and Pig. 
But the linguists of the animal 
kingdom, at least in their own and 
native tongues, are the primates 
. The chimpanzee, best studied 
of primates short of Man, not 
only has a vocabulary of some 32 
distinct words, according to 
Blanche Learned, but may have a 
unique claim to linguistic fame. A 
philologist named George Schwid- 
etzky believes he has found traces 
of Chimpanzee loan-words in an- 
cient Chinese (’ngak’), in a South 
African Bushman dialect (a 
tongue click), and even in mod- 
ern German! (The German word, 
‘geek,’ derived from Chimpanzee 
‘gack.’) 



“One definition of Man calls 
him ‘the tool-using animal’— yet 
elephants crop tree branches to 
swat flies, spider monkeys con- 
struct vine ladders for their 
young, and there is some plau- 
sible evidence that the polar bear 
hunts sleeping walruses with the 
aid of that primitive tool, the 
missile, in the form of a hurled 
chunk of ice. Another definition 
identifies Man as ‘the linguistic 
animal’— but even the few re- 
marks above will indicate that 
that claim is far less than unique.” 

Pohl’s postscript only hints at 
the great activity in deciphering 
animal languages and errs in stat- 
ing that the frog is the lowest ani- 
mal to have a voice — recordings 
of fish voices reveal the allegedly 
silent depths to be noisier than a 
reform school classroom. 

The practical applications of 
all this research? Slave Ship de- 
tails many; maybe you remember 
how its farmers teach cattle to eat 
weeds and leave the pay-crop 
alone, which could be done by 
any farmer today who cares to 
learn Cow. Fish could conceivably 
be a big help in surface and sub- 
marine ship detection. 

But there’s also knowledge for 
the sake of knowledge . partic- 
ularly when it serves as exciting 
idea background for a stimulating 
book that we are proud to have 
serialized.
