TWTHEN Man has colonized the 
far worlds, a prime import 
will be outrageous whoppers 
about how this or that those 
worlds are. Like these. 

Arid planets: Notice in the 
Deneb Gazette: “George Smith 
hereby withdraws his candidacy 
for treasurer of Maricopa County. 
It has rained enough for Mr. 
Smith to return to farming.” That 
was a 10-inch rain — the drops 
were 10 inches apart. Wolf IV is 
much drier; the postmasters there 
have to rivet the stamps to letters. 
On Dehyd, the water is wet on 
only one side. One Dehyder who 
operates a ferry hauls water all 
year just to keep his boat running. 

Cold planets: A Brrer was 
asked if Brr is as cold as people 
say. “We do have very short 
summers,” he admitted. “Summer 
last year was on a Tuesday.” On 
Icicle, a sheep raiser claimed his 
sheep, jumping from one hill to 
another, got stuck in the frozen 
air and hung there like clouds. 
“What about the law of gravity?” 
he was asked. “That was frozen 
solid, too,” he explained. The fish 
on Chill grow inch-long fur to 
keep them warm through the 
winter. 

Windy planets: The kids on 
Blast make kites from iron win- 
dow grills with log chains for tails.

One Howl hen got herself caught 
in a blow and was turned around 
the wrong way; before she could 
get herself straightened out, she 
had laid the same egg five times. 
A farmer on New America planted 
his wheat in Kansas, fertilized it 
in Colorado, harrowed it in Utah, 
weeded it in Nevada and har- 
vested it right back home. 




Healthful planets: Livelong 
started a cemetery, but they had 
to import a corpse from Dehyd. 
Old people on Tenscore have to 
go to other planets to die. “Is this 
place healthy?” a tourist asked a 
Vegan. “Sure is,” said the Vegan. 
“Why, when I first came to Vega, 
I couldn’t speak a single word, 
was absolutely hairless, had to be 
lifted from my bed and couldn’t 
walk two steps.” “Wonderful!” 
cried the tourist. “And how long 
have you been on Vega?” “I was 
born here,” the Vegan said.

Poor planets: A rancher on 
Poverty was asked how much he 
got for his herd of ziggls. “Not as 
much as I figured,” he said. “But 
then I never thought I would.” 
They tried raising cattle on Slum, 
but the steers were so thin, the 
men could brand them three at a 
time by putting carbon paper be- 
tween them. On Borrow, where 
rationing is standard, a farmer re- 
ported having several hundred 
pounds of meat in his freezer and 
got an official letter asking how 
come. He wrote back: “It was 
necessary for me to kill the whole 
animal at once.” 





Rich planets: “The reason you 
Moguls boast so much,” a Bor- 
rower grumbled, “is you have an 
inferiority complex.” “In that 
case,” the Mogul replied, “it’s the 
biggest inferiority complex in the

Galaxy.” Brrer visitor in Cc^ssal 
bookstore: “I’d like a small map 
of Colossus.” Indignant book- 
seller: “Madam, there is no such 
thing as a small map of Colossus.” 




After uranium was discovered on 
Aldebaran, the Alde-barons quit 
branding their goats and took 
them to town to be engraved. 
Spacegram from new circus press 
agent: “What have we got here 
on Plenty, absolutely the biggest 
midgets in the Universe or abso- 
lutely the littlest?” 

High-living planets: “Folks on 
Blotto sure are friendly,” reported 
a Vegan. “They talk to you right 
on the street, invite you to din- 
ner, take you up to their hotel 
room and buy you drinks.” “Did 
all that happen to you?” he was 



asked in awe. “No,” he said, “my 
sister.” Demanded the strict Slaj>- 
dash father, “What are your in- 
tentions toward my daughter — 
honorable or dishonorable?” Said 
the suitor, “You mean I’ve got a 
choice?” A Ripsnorter put a gun 
into a stranger’s ribs and ordered 
him to drink from his jug. The 
stranger strangled, “My gosh, 
that’s horrible stuff!” “Ain’t it?” 
agreed the Ripsnorter. “Now you 
hold the gun on me while I take 
a gulp.” 

Game planets: To kill an Al- 
tair proj, you have to aim fast, 
shoot faster, and whistle just as 
you shoot; the proj stops a mo- 
ment to see who whistled, which 
allows the bullet to catch up with 
him. A fish caught on Tackle was 
so big, a snapshot of it weighed 
seven poimds. 

Craggy worlds: Sign atop moun- 
tain road on Dizzy: Resume 

breathing. 

Flat worlds: “Monorail’s due in 
an hour,” said the Planer. “But I 
can’t see her yet, so she must be 
late.” 

Some of these tall tales may 
sound new, but each one here 
came from The Wild West Joke 
Book by Oren Arnold (Frederick 
Fell, $2.95), who says, “It isn’t 
necessary to originate a new joke. 
. All you have to do is tell 
them somewhere else.” 

Other planets, for instance?

PROLOGUE 



T his was a Golden Age, a 
time of high adventure, 
rich living and hard dying 
. but nobody thought so. This 
was a future of fortune and theft, 
pillage and rapine, culture and 
vice . but nobody admitted it. 



This was an era of extremes, a 
fascinating century of freaks . 
but nobody loved it. 

All the habitable worlds of the 
Solar System were occupied. 
Three planets and eight satel- 
lites and eleven million millions 




of people swarmed in one of the 
most exciting ages ever known, 
yet minds still yearned for other 
times, as always. The Solar Sys- 
tem seethed with activity . 
fighting, feeding and breeding, 
learning the new technologies that 
spewed forth almost before the 
old had been mastered, girding 
itself for the first exploration of 
the far-distant stars in deep space; 
but 

''Where are the new frontiers?” 
the Romantics cried, unaware 
that the frontier of the mind had 
opened in a laboratory on Callisto 
at the turn of the 24th century. 
A researcher named Jaunte set 
fire to his bench and himself (ac- 
cidentally) and let out a yell for 
help, with particular reference to 
a fire extinguisher. Who so sur- 
prised as Jaunte and his col- 
leagues when he found himself 
standing alongside said extin- 
guisher, seventy feet removed 
from his lab bench? 

They put Jaunte out and went 
into the whys and wherefores of 
his instantaneous seventy-foot 
journey. Teleportation— the trans- 
portation of oneself through space 
by an effort of the mind alone — 
had long been a theoretical con- 
cept, and there were a few hun- 
dred badly documented proofs 
that it had happened in the past. 
This was the first time that it had 
ever taken place before profes- 
sional observers. 



T hey investigated the Jaunte 
Effect savagely. This was 
something too Earth-shaking to 
handle with kid gloves and Jaunte 
was anxious to make his name 
immortal. He made his will and 
said farewell to his friends. Jaunte 
knew he was going to die because 
his fellow researchers were deter- 
mined to kill him, if necessary. 
There was no doubt about that. 

Twelve psychologists, parapsy- 
chologists and neurometrists of 
varying sp>ecialization were called 
in as observers. The experiment- 
ers sealed Jaunte into an un- 
breakable crystal tank. They 
opened a water valve, feeding 
water into the tank, and let 
Jaunte watch them smash the 
valve handle. It was impossible 
to open the tank; it was impos- 
sible to stop the flow of water. 

The theory was that if it had 
required the threat of death to 
goad Jaunte into teleporting him- 
self in the first place, they’d 
damned well threaten him with 
death again. 

The tank filled quickly. The 
observers collected data with the 
tense precision of an eclipse cam- 
era crew. Jaunte began to drown. 
Then he was outside the tank, 
dripping and coughing explo- 
sively. He’d teleported again. 

The experts examined and 
questioned him. They studied 
graphs and X-rays, neural pat- 
terns and body chemistry. They 



began to get an inkling of how 
Jaunte had teleported. On the 
technical grapevine (this had to 
be kept secret), they sent out a 
call for suicide volunteers. They 
were still in the primitive stage of 
teleportation; death was the only 
spur they knew. 

They briefed the volunteers 
thoroughly. Jaunte lectured on 
what he had done and how he 
thought he had done it. Then they 
proceeded to murder the volun- 
teers. They drowned them, 
hanged them, burned them; they 
invented new forms of slow and 
controlled death. There was never 
any doubt in any of the subjects 
that death was the object. 

Eighty per cent of the volun- 
ters died, and the agonies and 
remorse of their murderers would 
make a fascinating and horrible 
study, but that has no place in 
this history except to highlight 
the monstrosity of the times. 
Eighty per cent of the volunteers 
died, but twenty jjer cent jaunted. 
(The name became a word al- 
most immediately.) 

“Bring back the romantic age,” 
the Romantics pleaded, “when 
men can risk their lives in high 
adventure.” 

The body of knowledge grew 
rapidly. By the first decade of the 
25th century, the principles of 
jaunting were established and the 
first school was opened by Charles 
Fort Jaunte himself, then fifty- 



seven, immortalized, and ashamed 
to admit that he had never dared 
jaunte again. But the primitive 
days were past; it was no longer 
necessary to threaten a man with 
death to make him teleport. 

They had learned how to teach 
Man to recognize, discipline and 
exploit yet another resource of 
his limitless mind. 

TT OW, exactly, did Man tele- 
port? One of the most unsat- 
isfactory explanations was pro- 
vided by Spencer Thompson, 
publicity representative of the 
Jaunte Schools, in a press inter- 
view. 

THOMPSON: Jaunting is like 
seeing; it is a natural aptitude 
of almost every human organ- 
ism, but it can only be devel- 
oped by training and experi- 
ence. 

REPORTER: You mean we 

couldn’t see without practice? 
THOMPSON : Obviously you’re 
either unmarried or have no 
children . preferably both. 

(LAUGHTER) 

REPORTER: I don’t understand. 
THOMPSON: Anyone who’s ob- 
served an infant learning to 
use its eyes would. 
REPORTER: But what is tele- 
p>ortation? 

THOMPSON : The transporta- 
tion of oneself from one local- 
ity to another by an effort of 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



11 



the mind alone. 

REPORTER: You mean we can 
think ourselves from, say, New 
York to Chicago? 

THOMPSON j Precisely, pro- 
vided one thing is clearly un- 
derstood. In jaunting from 
New York to Chicago, it is nec- 
essary for the person teleport- 
ing himself to know exactly 
where he is when he starts and 
where he’s going. 

REPORTER: How’s that? 

THOMPSON: If you were in a 
dark room and unaware of 
where you were, it would be 
impossible to jaunte anywhere 
with safety. And if you knew 
where you were, but intended 
to jaunte to a place you had 
never seen, you would never 
arrive alive. One cannot jaunte 
from an unknown departure 
point to an unknown destina- 
tion. Both must be known, 
memorized and visualized. 

REPORTER: But if we know 
where we are and where we’re 
going — ? 

THOMPSON: We can be pretty 
sure we’ll jaunte and arrive. 

REPORTER: Would we arrive 
naked? 

THOMPSON: If you started 

naked. 

(LAUGHTER) 

REPORTER: I mean would our 
clothes teleport with us? 

THOMPSON : When people tele- 
port, they also teleport the 



clothes they wear and whatever 
they are strong enough to carry. 
I hate to disappoint you, but 
even ladies’ clothes would ar- 
rive with them. 

(LAUGHTER) 

REPORTER: But how do we do 
it? 

THOMPSON: How do we think? 
REPORTER : With our minds. 
THOMPSON : And how does the 
mind think? What is the think- 
ing process? Exactly how do 
we remember, imagine, deduce, 
create? Exactly how do the 
brain cells operate? 
REPORTER: I don’t know. No- 
body knows. 

THOMPSON: And nobody 

knows exactly how we tele- 
port either, but we know we 
can do it — just as we know 
that we can think. Have you 
ever heard of Descartes? He 
said: Cogito ergo sum. I think, 
therefore I am. We say: Cogito 
ergo jaunte. I think, therefore 
I jaunte. 

If it is thought that Thomp- 
son’s explanation is exasperating, 
inspect this report of Sir John 
Kelvin to the Royal Society on 
the mechanism of jaunting: 

We have established that the tele- 
portative ability is associated with 
the Nissl bodies, or Titjroid Sub- 
stance, in nerve cells. The Tigroid 
Substance is easiest demonstrated by 
Nissl’s method using 3.75 g. of 



12 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



methylene blue and 1.75 g. of Vene- 
tian soap dissolved in 1,000 cc. of 
water. 

Where the Tigroid Substance does 
not appear, jaunting is impossible. 
Teleportation is a Tigroid Function. 

A ny man was capable of jaunt- 
ing, provided he developed 
two faculties, visualization and 
concentration. He had to visual- 
ize, completely and precisely, the 
spot to which he desired to tele- 
port himself; and he had to con- 
centrate the latent energy of his 
mind into a single thrust to get 
him there. Above all, he had to 
have faith . the faith that 
Charles Fort Jaunte never recov- 
ered. He had to believe he would 
jaunte. The slightest doubt would 
block the mind-thrust necessary 



for successful teleportation. 

The limitations with which 
every man is born necessarily 
limited the ability to jaunte. 
Some could visualize magnifi- 
cently and set the coordinates of 
their destination with precision, 
but lacked the power to get there. 
Others had the power but could 
not, so to speak, see where they 
were jaunting. And space set a 
final limitation, for no man had 
ever jaunted farther than a thou- 
sand miles. He could work his 
way in jaunting jumps over land 
and water from Nome to Mexico, 
but no jump could exceed a thou- 
sand miles. 

By the 2420s, this form of em- 
ployment application blank had 
become a commonplace:

Despite all efforts, no man had 
ever jaunted across the voids of 
space, although many experts and 
fools had tried. Helmut Grant, for 
one, who spent a month memoriz- 
ing the coordinates of a jaunte 
stage on the Moon and visualized 
every mile of the two-hundred- 
and-forty-thousand-mile trajec- 
tory from Times Square to Kep- 
ler City. Grant jaunted and dis- 
appeared. They never found him. 

They also never found Enzio 
Dandridge, a Los Angeles revival- 
ist looking for Heaven; Jacob 
Maria Freundlich, a paraphysicist 
who should have known better 
than to jaunte into deep space 
searching for meta-dimensions; 
Shipwreck Cogan, a professional 
seeker after notoriety; and hun- 
dreds of others, lunatic-fringers, 
neurotics, escapists and suicides. 

Space ^s closed to teleporta- 
tion. Jaunting was restricted to 
the surfaces of the planets of the 
Solar System. 

UT within three generations, 
the entire Solar System was 
on the jaunte. The transition was 
more spectacular than the change- 
over from horse and buggy to 
gasoline age four centuries before. 
On three planets and eight satel- 
lites, social, legal and economic 
structures crashed while the new 
customs and laws demanded by 
universal jaunting mushroomed 
in their place. 

14 



There were land riots as the 
jaunting poor deserted slums to 
squat in plains and forests, raid- 
ing the livestock and wildlife. 
There was a revolution in home 
and office building; labyrinths 
and masking devices had to be in- 
troduced to prevent unlawful 
entry by jaunting. There were 
crashes and panics and strikes 
and famines as pre-jaunte indus- 
tries failed. 

Plagues and pandemics raged 
as jaunting vagrants carried dis- 
ease and vermin into defenseless 
countries. Malaria, elephantiasis 
and break-bone fever came north 
to Greenland; rabies returned to 
England after an absence of three 
hundred years. The Japanese 
beetle, the citrous scale, the chest- 
nut blight and the elm borer 
spread to every corner of the 
world, and from one forgotten 
pest-hole in Borneo, leprosy, long 
considered extinct, reappeared. 

Crime waves swept the planets 
and satellites as their underworlds 
took to jaunting with the night 
around the clock, and there were 
brutalities as the police fought 
them without quarter. There 
came a hideous return to the 
worst prudery of Victorianism as 
society, with protocol and taboo, 
fought the sexual and moral dan- 
gers of jaunting. A cruel and vi- 
cious war broke out between the 
Inner Planets — Venus, Terra and 
Mars — and the Outer Satellites, a 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



war brought on by the economic 
and political pressures of telepor- 
tation. 

Until the Jaunte Age dawned, 
the three Inner Planets (and the 
Moon) had lived in delicate eco- 
nomic balance with the seven in- 
habited Outer Satellites — lo, Eu- 
rope, Ganymede and Callisto of 
Jupiter; Rhea and Titan of Sat- 
urn; and Lassell of Neptune. The 
United Outer Satellites supplied 
raw materials for the Inner Plan- 
ets’ factories and a market for 
their finished goods. Within a dec- 
ade, this balance was destroyed 
by jaunting. 

The Outer Satellites, raw young 
worlds in the making, had bought 
seventy per cent of the I.P. trans- 
pKDrtation production. Jaunting 
ended that. They had bought 
ninety per cent of the I.P. com- 
munications production. Jaunting 
ended that, too. In consequence, 
I.P. purchase of O.S. raw mate- 
rials fell off. 

With trade exchange destroyed, 
it was inevitable that the eco- 
nomic war would degenerate into 
a shooting war. Inner Planet 
cartels refused to ship manufactur- 
ing equipment to the Outer Satel- 
lites, attempting to protect them- 
selves against competition. The 
O.S. confiscated the plants al- 
ready in operation on their 
worlds, broke patent agreements, 
ignored royalty obligations . 
and the war was on. 



It was an age of freaks, mon- 
sters and grotesques. All the world 
was misshapen in marvelous and 
malevolent ways. The Classicists 
and Romantics who hated it were 
unaware of the potential great- 
ness of the 25th century. They 
were blind to a cold fact of evolu- 
tion — that progress stems from 
the clashing merger of antagonis- 
tic extremes, out of the marriage 
of pinnacle freaks. Classicists and 
Romantics alike were unaware 
that the Solar System was trem- 
bling on the verge of a human ex- 
plosion that would transform Man 
and make him the master of the 
Universe. 

It is against this seething back- 
ground of the 25th century that 
the vengeful history of Gulliver 
Foyle begins.

H e was one hundred and sev- 
enty days dying and not yet 
dead. He fought for survival with 
the passion of a beast in a trap. 
Occasionally his primitive mind 
emerged from the burning night- 
mare of survival into something 
resembling sanity. Then he lifted 
his mute face to Eternity and 
muttered: “What’s a matter, me? 
Help, you goddam Gods! Help, 
is all.” 

Blasphemy came easily to him; 
it was half his speech, all his life. 
He had been raised in the gutter

school of the 25th century and 
spoke nothing but the gutter 
tongue. Of all brutes in the world, 
he was among the least valuable 
alive and most likely to survive. 
So he struggled and prayed in 
blasphemy; but occasionally his 
raveling mind leaped backward 
to his childhood and remembered 
a nursery jingle: 

Gully Foyle is my name 
And Terra is my nation. 

Deep space is my dwelling place 
And death’s my destination. 

He was Gulliver Foyle, Me- 
chanic’s Mate 3rd Class, thirty 
years old, big-boned and rough 
. and one hundred and seventy 
days adrift in space. He was Gully 
Foyle, the oiler, wiper, bunker- 
man; too easy for trouble, too 
slow for fun, too empty for friend- 
ship, too lazy for love. The lethar- 
gic outlines of his character 
showed in the official Merchant 
Marine records; 

FOYLE, GULLIVER -

EDUCATION: NONE 

SKILLS; NONE 

MERITS: NONE 

RECOMMENDATIONS: NONE 

(PERSONNEL COMMENTS) 

A man of physical strength and 
intellectual potential stunted by 
lack of ambition. Energizes at 
minimum. The stereotype Com- 
mon Man. Some unexpected shock 
might possibly awaken him, but 
Psych cannot find the key. Not 



recommended for further pro- 
motion. 

Foyle had reached a dead end. 
He had been content to drift from 
moment to moment of existence 
for thirty years like some heavily 
armored creature, sluggish and in- 
different . Gully Foyle, the 
stereotype Common Man; but 
now he was adrift in space for 
one hundred and seventy days, 
and the key to his awakening was 
in the lock. Presently it would 
turn and open the door to holo- 
caust. 

T he spaceship Nomad drifted 
halfway between Mars and 
Jupiter. Whatever war catastro- 
phe had wrecked it had taken a 
sleek steel rocket, one hundred 
yards long and one hundred feet 
broad, and mangled it into a 
skeleton on which was mounted 
the remains of cabins, holds, 
decks and bulkheads. Great rents 
in the hull were blazes of light on 
the sunside and frosty blotches of 
stars on the darkside. The SS 
Nomad was a weightless empti- 
ness of blinding sun and jet 
shadow, frozen and silent. 

The wreck was filled with a 
floating conglomerate of frozen 
debris that hung within the de- 
stroyed vessel like an instantane- 
ous photograph of an explosion.

tion of the bits of rubble for each

other was slowly drawing them 
into clusters which were periodi- 
cally tom apart by the passage 
through them of the one survivor 
still alive on the wreck, Gulliver 
Foyle, AS-128/127:006. 

He lived in the only airtight 
room left intact in the wreck, a 
tool locker off the main-deck cor- 
ridor. The locker was four feet 
wide, four feet deep and nine feet 
high. It was the size of a giant’s 
coffin. Six himdred years before, 
it had been judged the most ex- 
quisite Oriental torture to impri- 
son a man in a cage that size for 
a few weeks. Yet Foyle had ex- 
isted in this lightless coffin for 
five months, twenty days and four 
hours. 

* * * 

“Who are you?” 

“Gully Foyle is my name.” 
“Where are you from?” 

“Terra is my nation.” 

“Where are you now?” 

“Deep space is my dwelling 
place.” 

“Where are you bound?” 
“Death’s my destination.” 

On the one hundred and sev- 
enty-first day of his fight for sur- 
vival, Foyle answered these ques- 
tions and awoke. His heart 
hammered and his throat burned. 

He groped in the dark for the 
air tank which shared his coffin 
with him and checked it. The 
tank was empty. Another would 
have to be moved in at once. So 



this day would commence with 
an extra skirmish with death 
which Foyle accepted with mute 
endurance. 

He felt through the locker 
shelves and located a torn space- 
suit. It was the only one aboard 
the Nomad and Foyle no longer 
remembered where or how he had 
found it. He had sealed the tear 
with emergency spray, but had no 
way of refilling or replacing the 
empty oxygen cartridges on the 
back. 

Foyle got into the suit. It would 
hold enough air from the locker 
to allow him five minutes in vac- 
uum — no more. 

Foyle opened the locker door 
and plunged out into the black 
frost of space. The air in the 
locker puffed out with him and 
its moisture congealed into a tiny 
snow cloud that drifted down the 
torn main-deck corridor. Foyle 
heaved at the exhausted air tank, 
floated it out of the locker and 
abandoned it. 

One minute was gone. 

TIE TURNED and propelled 
himself through the floating 
debris toward the hatch to the 
ballast hold. He did not run; his 
gait was the unique locomotion of 
free-fall and weightlessness — 
thrusts with foot, elbow and hand 
against deck, wall and corner, a 
slow-motion swooping through 
space like a bat flying under wa-

ter. Foyle shot through the hatch 
into the darkside ballast hold. 
Two minutes were gone. 

Like all spaceships, the Nomad 
was ballasted and stiffened with 
the mass of her gas tanks laid 
down the length of her keel like a 
long lumber raft tapped at the 
sides by a labyrinth of pipe fit- 
tings. Foyle took a minute discon- 
necting an air tank. He had no 
way of knowing whether it was 
full or already exhausted, whether 
he would fight it back to his 
locker only to discover that it 
was empty and his life was ended. 
Once a week, he endured this 
game of space roulette. 

There was a roaring in his ears; 
the air in his spacesuit was rap- 
idly going foul. He yanked the 
massy cylinder toward the ballast 
hatch, ducked to let it sail over 
his head, then thrust himself after 
it. He swung the tank through the 
hatch. Four minues had elapsed 
and he was shaking and blacking 
out. He guided the tank down the 
main-deck corridor and bulled it 
into the tool locker. 

He slammed the locker door, 
dogged it, found a hammer on a 
shelf and swung it against the 
frozen tank to loosen the valve. 
Foyle twisted the handle grimly. 
With the last of his strength, he 
unsealed the helmet of his space- 
suit, lest he suffocate within the 
suit while the locker filled with 
air ... if this tank contained air. 



He fainted, as he had fainted so 
often before, never knowing 
whether this was death. 

^ -Sfi 

“Who are you?” 

“Gully Foyle.” 

“Where are you from?” 
“Terra.” 

“Where are you now?” 

“Space.” 

“Where are you bound?” 

He awoke. He was alive. He 
wasted no time on prayer or 
thanks but continued the business 
of survival. In the darkness, he 
explored the locker shelves where 
he kept his rations. There were 
only a few packets left. Since he 
was already wearing the patched 
spacesuit, he might just as well 
run the gantlet of vacuum again 
and replenish his supplies. 

He flooded his spacesuit with 
air from the tank, resealed his 
helmet and sailed out into the 
frost and light again. He squirmed 
down the main-deck corridor and 
ascended the remains of a stair- 
way to control deck, which was 
no more than a roofed corridor in 
space. Most of the walls were de- 
stroyed. 

W ITH the Sun on his right and 
the stars on his left, Foyle 
shot aft toward the galley store- 
room. Halfway down the corri- 
dor, he passed a door frame still 
standing foursquare between deck 
and roof. The leaf hung on its 



hinges, half open, a door to no- 
where. Behind it was all space 
and the steady stars. 

As Foyle passed the door, he 
had a quick view of himself re- 
flected in the polished chrome of 
the leaf . Gully Foyle, a giant 
gaunt creature, bearded, crusted 
with dried blood, emaciated, with 
sick, patient eyes . and followed 
always by a stream of floating 
debris, the raffle disturbed by his 
motion and following him through 
space like the tail of a festering 
comet. 

Foyle turned into the galley 
storeroom and began looting with 
the methodical speed of five 
months’ habit. Most of the bottled 
goods had frozen solid and ex- 
ploded. Much of the canned 
goods had lost their containers, 
for tin crumbles to dust in the 
absolute zero of space. Foyle 
gathered up ration packets, con- 
centrates and a chunk of ice from 
the burst water tank. He threw 
everything into a large copper 
cauldron, turned and darted out 
of the storeroom, carrying the 
cauldron. 

At the door to nowhere, Foyle 
glanced at himself again, reflected 
in the chrome leaf framed in the 
stars. Then he stopped his motion 
in bewilderment. He stared at the 
stars behind the door which had 
become familiar friends after five 
months. There was an intruder 
among them — a comet, it seemed. 



with an invisible head and a 
short, spurting tail. Then Foyle 
realized he was staring at a space- 
ship, stern rockets flaring as it ac- 
celerated on a Sunward course 
that must pass him. 

“No,” he muttered. “No, man. 
No.” 

He was continually suffering 
from hallucinations. He turned to 
resume the journey back to his 
coffin. Then he looked again. It 
was still a spaceship, stem rockets 
flaring as it accelerated on a Sun- 
ward course which must pass him. 
He discussed the illusion with 
Eternity. 

“Six months already,” he said 
in his gutter tongue. “Is it now? 
You listen a me, lousy Gods. I 
talkin’ a deal, is all. I look again, 
sweet prayer-men. If it’s a ship, 
I’m yours. You own me. But if it’s 
a gaff, man — if it’s no ship — I 
unseal right now and blow my 
guts. We both ballast level, us. 
Now reach me the sign, yes or no, 
is all.” 

He looked for a third time. For 
the third time, he saw a space- 
ship, stern rockets flaring as it ac- 
celerated on a Sunward course 
which must pass him. 

It was the sign. He believed. 
He was saved. 

‘C'OYLE shoved off and went 
hurtling down the control-deck 
corridor toward the bridge. But 
at the companionway stairs, he re-

strained himself. He could not re- 
main conscious for more than a 
few more moments without refill- 
ing his spacesuit. He gave the ap- 
proaching spaceship one pleading 
look, then shot down to the tool 
locker and shakingly pumped his 
suit full. 

He mounted to the control 
bridge. Through the starboard ob- 
servation port, he saw the space- 
ship, stern rockets still flaring, 
evidently making a major altera- 
tion in course, for it was bearing 
down on him very slowly. 

On a panel marked FLARES, 
Foyle pressed the DISTRESS 
button. There was a three-second 
pause during which he suffered. 
Then white radiance blinded him 
as the distress signal went off in 
three triple bursts, nine prayers 
for help. Foyle pressed the button 
twice again, and twice more the 
flares flashed in space while the 
radioactives incorporated in their 
combustion set up a static howl 
that must register on any wave- 
band of any receiver. 

The stranger’s jets cut off. Foyle 
had been seen. He would be 
saved. He was reborn. 

He exulted. 

OYLE swooped back to his 
locker and replenished his 
spacesuit. He began to weep as 
he started to gather his posses- 
sions — a faceless clock which he 
kept wound just to listen to the 



ticking, a lug wrench with a hand- 
shap>ed handle which he would 
hold in lonely moments, an egg- 
slicer upon whose wires he would 
pluck primitive tunes. He dropped 
them in his excitement, hunted 
for them in the dark, then began 
to laugh at himself. 

He filled his spacesuit with air 
once more and capered back to 
the bridge. He punched a flare 
button labeled RESCUE. From 
the hull of the Nomad shot a sun- 
let that burst and hung, flooding 
miles of space with harsh white 
light. 

“Come on, baby you,” Foyle 
crooned. “Hurry up, man. Come 
on, baby baby you.” 

Like a ghost torpedo, the 
stranger slid into the outermost 
rim of light, approaching slowly, 
looking him over. For a moment, 
Foyle’s heart constricted; the ship 
was behaving so cautiously that 
he feared she was an enemy ves- 
sel from the Outer Satellites. 

Then he saw the famous red 
and blue emblem on her side, the 
trademark of the mighty indus- 
trial clan of Presteign; Presteign 
of Terra, jjowerful, munificent, 
beneficent. And he knew this was 
a sister ship, for the Nomad was 
also Presteign-owned. He knew 
this was an angel from space hov- 
ering over him. 

“Sweet sister,” Foyle crooned. 
“Baby angel, fly away home with 
me.

T he ship came abreast of 
Foyle, illuminated p>orts along 
its side glowing with friendly 
light, its name and registry num- 
ber clearly visible in illuminated 
figures on the hull: VORGA- 
T:1339. The ship was alongside 
him in a moment, passing him in 
a second, disappearing in a third. 

The sister had spurned him; 
the angel had abandoned him. 

Foyle stopped dancing and 
crooning. He stared in dismay. He 
leaped to the flare panel and 
slapped buttons. Distress signals, 
landing, takeoff and quarantine 
flares burst from the hull of the 
Nomad in a madness of white, red 
and green light, pulsing, pleading 
. and yor^a-T:1339 passed si- 
lently and implacably, stem jets 
flaring again as it accelerated on 
a Sunward course. 

So, in five seconds, he was born, 
he lived and he died. After thirty 
years of existence and six months 
of torture. Gully Foyle, the stere- 
otype Common Man, was no 
more. The key turned in the lock 
of his soul and the door was 
opened. What emerged expunged 
the Common Man forever. 

“You pass me by,” he said with 
slow mounting fury. “You leave 
me rot like a dog. You leave me 
die, Vorga . Vor^a-T: 1339. No. 
I get out of here, me. I follow 
you, Vorga. I find you, Vorga. I 
pay you back, me. I rot you. I kill 
you, Vorga. I kill you filthy.” 



The acid of fury ran through 
him, eating away the brute pa- 
tience and sluggishness that had 
made a cipher of Gully Foyle, 
precipitating a chain of reactions 
that would make an infernal ma- 
chine of Gully Foyle. He was 
dedicated. 

“Vorga. I kill you filthy.” 

♦ ♦ 

He did what the cipher could 
not do — he rescued himself. 

For two days, he combed the 
wreckage in five-minute forays 
and devised a harness for his 
shoulders. He attached an air 
tank to the harness and con- 
nected the tank to his spacesuit 
helmet with an improvised hose. 
He wriggled through space like 
an ant dragging a log, but he had 
the freedom of the Nomad for all 
time. 

He thought. 

In the control bridge, he taught 
himself to use the few navigation 
instruments that were still un- 
broken, studying the standard 
manuals that littered the wrecked 
navigation room. In the ten years 
of his service in space, he had 
never dreamed of attempting 
such a thing, despite the rewards 
of promotion and pay; but now he 
had Vorga-T\ 1339 to reward him. 

He took sights. The Nomad 
was drifting in space on the eclip- 
tic, three hundred million miles 
from the Sun. Before him were 
spread the constellations Per- 



THB STARS MY DESTINATION

seus, Andromeda and Pisces. 
Hanging almost in the foreground 
was a dusty orange spot that was 
Jupiter, distinctly a planetary 
disc to the naked eye. 

With any luck, he could make 
a course for Jupiter and rescue. 

J UPITER was not, could never 
be habitable. Like all the 
planets beyond the asteroid or- 
bits, it was a frozen mass of meth- 
ane and ammonia, but its four 
largest satellites swarmed with 
cities and populations now at war 
with the Inner Planets. He would 
be a war prisoner, but he had to 
stay alive to settle accounts with 
Vor^a-T: 1339. 

Foyle insp>ected the engine 
room of the Nomad. There was 
Hi-Thrust fuel remaining in the 
tanks and one of the four tail jets 
was still in operative condition. 

Foyle found the engine-room 
manuals and studied them. He re- 
paired the connection between 
fuel tanks and the one jet cham- 
ber. The tanks were on the sun- 
side of the wreck and warmed 
above freezing point. The Hi- 
Thrust was still liquid, but it 
would not flow. In free-fall, there 
was no gravity to draw the fuel 
down the pip>es. 

Foyle studied a space manual 
and learned something about the- 
oretical gravity. If he could put 
the Nomad into a spin, centrifu- 
gal force would impart enough 



gravitation to the ship to draw 
fuel down into the combustion 
chamber of the jet. If he could 
fire the combustion chamber, the 
imequal thrust of the one jet 
would impart a spin to the 
Nomad. 

But he couldn’t fire the jet 
without first having the spin; and 
he couldn’t get the spin without 
first firing the jet. 

He thought his way out of the 
deadlock, inspired by Vorga. 

Foyle opened the drainage pet- 
cock in the combustion chamber 
of the jet and tortuously filled the 
chamber with fuel by hand. He 
had primed the pump. Now, if he 
ignited the fuel, it would fire long 
enough to impart the spin and 
start gravity. Then the flow from 
the tanks would commence and 
the rocketing would continue. 

He tried matches. 

Matches will not burn in the 
vacuum of space. 

He tried flint and steel. 

Sparks will not glow in the ab- 
solute zero of space. 

He thought of red-hot filaments. 

He had no electric power of 
any description aboard the No- 
mad to make a filament red hot. 

He found texts and read. Al- 
though he was blacking out fre- 
quently and close to complete 
collapse, he thought and planned. 
He was inspired to greatness by 
Vorga. 

Foyle brought ice from the 



22 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



frozen galley tanks, melted it 
with his own body heat, and 
added water to the jet combus- 
tion chamber. The fuel and the 
water were non-miscible; they did 
not mix. The water floated in a 
thin layer over the fuel. 

ROM the chemical stores, 

Foyle brought a silvery bit of 
wire, pure sodium metal. He 
poked the wire through the open 
petcock. The sodium ignited when 
it touched the water and flared 
with high heat. The heat touched 
off the Hi-Thrust, which burst in 
a needle flame from the petcock. 
Foyle closed the petcock with a 
wrench. The ignition held in the 
chamber and the lone aft jet 
slammed out flame with a sound- 
less vibration that shook the ship. 

The off-center thrust of the jet 
twisted the Nomad into a slow 
spin. The torque imparted a slight 
gravity. Weight returned. The 
floating debris that cluttered the 
hull fell to decks, walls and ceil- 
ings; and the gravity kept the 
fuel feeding from tanks to com- 
bustion chamber. 

Foyle wasted no time on cheers. 
He left the engine room and 
struggled forward in desperate 
haste for a final, fatal observation 
from the control bridge. This 
would tell him whether the No- 
mad was committed to a wild 
plunge out into the no-return of 
deep space, or a course for Jupi- 



ter and the chance of rescue. 

The slight gravity made his air 
tank almost impossible to drag. 
The sudden forward surge of ac- 
celeration shook loose masses of 
debris which flew backward 
through the Nomad. 

As Foyle struggled up the com- 
panionway stairs to the control 
deck, the rubble from the bridge 
came hurtling back down the cor- 
ridor and smashed into him. He 
was caught up in this tumbleweed 
in space, rolled back the length 
of the empty corridor and brought 
up against the galley bulkhead 
with an impact that shattered his 
last hold on consciousness. 

He lay pinned in the center of 
half a ton of wreckage, helpless, 
barely alive, but still raging for 
vengeance. 

“Who are you?” 

“Where are you from?” 
“Where are you now?” 

“Where are you bound?”

is spread the broad belt of 
the asteroids. Of the thousands, 
known and unknown, most unique 
to the Freak Century was the 
Sargasso Asteroid, a tiny planet 
manufactured of natural rock and 
wreckage, salvaged by its inhabi- 
tants in the course of two hun- 
dred years. 

They were savages, the only

23 



savages of the 25th century; de- 
scendants of a research team of 
scientists that had been lost and 
marooned in the Asteroid Belt 
two centuries before, when their 
ship had failed. By the time their 
descendants were rediscovered, 
they had built up a world and a 
culture of their own and pre- 
ferred to remain in space, salvag- 
ing and spoiling, and practicing a 
barbaric travesty of the scientific 
method they remembered from 
their forebears. They called them- 
selves The Scientific People. The 
world promptly forgot them. 

SS Nomad looped through 
space, neither on a course for Ju- 
piter nor the far stars, but drift- 
ing across the Asteroid Belt in 
the slow spiral of a dying animal- 
cule. It passed within a mile of 
the Sargasso Asteroid and it was 
immediately captured by The 
Scientific People to be incorpo- 
rated into their little planet. They 
found Foyle. 

He awoke once while he was 
being carried in triumph on a lit- 
ter through the natural and artifi- 
cial passages within the scavenger 
asteroid. The passages were con- 
structed of meteor metal, stone 
and hull plates. Some of the plates 
still bore names long forgotten in 
the history of space travel: Indus 
Queen, Terra; Syrtus Rambler, 
Mars; Three Ring Circus, Saturn. 
The passages led to great halls, 
storerooms, apartments and 



homes, all built of salvaged ships 
cemented into the asteroid. 

In rapid succession, Foyle was 
borne through an ancient Gany- 
mede scow, a Lassell ice-borer, a 
captain’s barge, a Callisto heavy 
cruiser, a 22nd-century fuel trans- 
port with glass tanks still filled 
with smoky rocket fuel. Two cen- 
turies of salvage were gathered in 
this hive: armories of weapons, 
libraries of books, museums of 
costume, warehouses of machin- 
ery, tools, rations, drink, chemi- 
cals, synthetics and surrogates. 

A crowd around the litter was 
howling triumphantly. “Quant 
Suff!” they shouted. A woman’s 
chorus began an excited bleating: 
“Ammonium bromide gr. 1 V 2 
Potassium bromide gr. 3 
Sodium bromide gr. 2 

Citric acid quant, suff.” 

“Quant Suff!” The Scientific 
People roared. “Quant Suff!” 
Foyle fainted. 

¥TE AWOKE again. He had 
been taken out of his space- 
suit. He was in the greenhouse of 
the asteroid, where plants were 
grown for fresh oxygen. The hun- 
dred-yard hull of an old ore car- 
rier formed the room and one 
wall had been entirely fitted with 
salvaged windows — round ports, 
square ports, diamond, hexagonal 
— every shape and age of port 
had been introduced until the 
vast wall was a crazy quilt of

haphazard glass and weird light. 

The distant Sun blazed 
through; the air was hot and 
moist. Foyle gazed around dimly. 
A devil face peered at him. 
Cheeks, chin, nose and eyelids 
were hideously tattooed like an 
ancient Maori mask. 

Across the brow was tattooed 
J <5 SEPH. 

The “O” in JOSEPH had a 
tiny arrow thrust up from the 
right shoulder, turning it into the 
symbol of Mars, used by scien- 
tists to designate male sex. 

“We are the Scientific Race,” 
the devil face said. “I am J 3 seph; 
these are my people.” 

He gestured. Foyle gazed at the 
grinning crowd surrounding his 
litter. All faces were tattooed into 
devil masks; all brows had names 
blazoned across them. 

“How long did you drift?” J ij s- 
eph asked. 

“VoTga” Foyle mumbled. 

“You are the first to arrive 
alive in fifty years. You are a 
puissant man. Very. Arrival of 
the fittest is the doctrine of Holy 
Darwin. Most scientific.” 

“Quant Suff!” the crowd bel- 
lowed. 

J S seph seized Foyle’s elbow 
in the manner of a physician tak- 
ing a pulse. His devil mouth 
counted solemnly up to ninety- 
eight. 

“Your pulse— ninety-eight point 
six,” J 3 seph said, producing a 



thermometer and shaking it rev- 
erently. “Most scientific.” 

“Quant Suff!” came the chorus. 

J 3 seph proffered an Erlen- 
meyer fiask. It was labeled : Lung, 
Cat. C.S., hematoxylin Ss eosin. 

“Vitamin?” J 3 seph inquired. 

When Foyle did not respond, 
J 3 seph removed a large pill from 
the flask, placed it in the bowl of 
a pipe and lit it. He puffed once 
and then gestured. Three girls 
appeared before Foyle. Their 
faces were grotesquely tattooed. 
Across each brow was a name: 

J$ AN. 

M $ IRA. 

P 9 LLY. 

The “O” of each name had a 
tiny cross at the base, the sign of 
Venus and female sex. 

“Choose,” J 3 seph said. “The 
Scientific People practice Natural 
Selection. Be scientific in your 
choice. Be genetic.” 

As Foyle fainted again, his arm 
slid off the litter and glanced 
against M 9 ira. 

“Quant Suff!” 

t'OYLE was in a circular hall 
•*- with a domed roof. The hall 
was filled with rusting antique ap- 
paratus: a centrifuge, an operat- 
ing table, a wrecked fluoroscope, 
autoclaves, cases of corroded sur- 
gical instruments. 

They strapped Foyle down on 
the operating table while he raved 
and rambled. They fed him. They

shaved and bathed him. Two men 
began turning the ancient centri- 
fuge by hand. It emitted a rhyth- 
mic clanking like the pounding of 
a war drum. The assembled be- 
gan tramping and chanting. 

They turned on the ancient au- 
toclave. It boiled and geysered, 
filling the hall with howling 
steam. They turned on the old 
fluoroscope. It was short-circuited 
and it spat sizzling bolts of light- 
ning across the steaming hall. 

A ten-foot figure loomed up to 
the table. It was J i seph on stilts. 
He wore a surgical cap, a surgical 
mask and a surgeon’s gown that 
hung from his shoulders to the 
floor. The gown was heavily em- 
broidered with red and black 
thread, illustrating anatomical 
sections of the body. J i seph was 
a lurid tapestry out of a surgical 
text. 

“I pronounce you Nomad!” 
J i seph intoned. 

The uproar became deafening. 
J i seph tilted a rusty can over 
Foyle’s body. There was the reek 
of ether. Foyle lost his tatters of 
consciousness and darkness en- 
veloped him. Out of the darkness, 
For^a-T:1339 surged again and 
again, accelerating on a Sunward 
course that burst through Foyle’s 
blood and brains until he could 
not stop screaming silently for 
vengeance.

He was dimly aware of wash- 



ings and feedings and trampings 
and chantings. At last he awoke 
to a lucid interval. There was si- 
lence. He was in a bed. The girl, 
M 9 ira, was in bed with him. 

“Who you?” Foyle croaked. 

“Your wife. Nomad.” 

“What?” 

“Your wife. You chose me, No- 
mad. We are gametes.” 

“What?” 

“Scientifically mated,” M 9 ira 
said proudly. She pulled up the 
sleeve of her nightgown and 
showed him her arm. It was dis- 
figured by four ugly slashes. “I 
have been inoculated with some- 
thing old, something new, some- 
thing borrowed and something 
blue.” 

Foyle struggled out of the bed. 
“Where we now?” 

“In our home.” 

“What home?” 

“Yours. You are one of us. No- 
mad. You must marry every 
month and beget many children. 
That will be scientific. But I am 
the first.” 

Foyle ignored her and explored. 
He was in the main cabin of a 
small rocket launch of the early 
2300s, once a private yacht. The 
main cabin had been converted 
into a bedroom. 

ICTE lurched to the ports and

oid, connected by passages to the

main body. He went aft. Two 
smaller cabins were filled with 
growing plants for oxygen. The 
engine room had been converted 
into a kitchen. There was Hi- 
Thrust in the fuel tanks, but it 
fed the burners of a small stove 
atop the rocket chambers. Foyle 
went forward. The control cabin 
was now a parlor, but the controls 
were still operative. 

He thought. 

Then he went aft to the kitchen 
and dismantled the stove. He re- 
connected the fuel tanks to the 
original jet combustion chambers. 
M 9 ira followed him curiously. 
“What are you doing. Nomad?” 
“Got to get out of here, girl,” 
Foyle mumbled. “Got business 
with a ship called Vorga. You dig 
me, girl? Going to ram out in 
this boat, is all.” 

M 9 ira backed away in alarm. 
Foyle saw the look in her eyes 
and leaped for her. He was so 
crippled that she avoided him 
easily. She opened her mouth and 
let out a scream. At that moment, 
a mighty clangor filled the launch; 
it was J S seph and his devil- 
faced Scientic People outside, 
banging on the metal hull, going 
through the ritual of a scientific 
charivari for the newlyweds. 

M 9 ira screamed and dodged 
while Foyle pursued her patient- 
ly. He trapped her in a corner, 
ripped her nightgown off and 
bound and gagged her with it. 



M 9 ira made enough noise to 
split the asteroid open, but the 
scientific charivari was louder. 

Foyle finished his rough patch- 
ing of the engine room; he was 
almost an expert by now. He 
picked up the writhing girl and 
took her to the main hatch. 

“Leaving,” he shouted in 
M 9 ira’s ear. “Take off. Blast right 
out of asteroid. Hell of a smash, 
girl. Maybe all die, you. Every- 
thing busted wide open. Guesses 
for grabs what happens. No more 
air. No more asteroid. Go tell’m. 
Warn’m. Go, girl.” 

He opened the hatch, shoved 
M 9 ira out, slammed the hatch 
and dogged it. The charivari 
stopped abruptly. 

At the controls, Foyle pressed 
ignition. The automatic takeoff 
siren began a shriek that had not 
sounded in decades. The jet cham- 
bers ignited with dull concussions. 
Foyle waited for the temp>erature 
to reach firing heat. 

While he waited, he suffered. 
The launch was cemented into 
the asteroid. It was surrounded by 
stone and iron. Its rear jets were 
flush on the hull of another ship 
packed into the riiass. He didn’t 
know what would happen when 
his jets began their thrust, but 
he was driven to gamble by 
Vorga. 

He fired the jets. There was a 
hollow explosion as Hi-Thrust 
flamed out of the stern of the

ship. The launch shuddered, 
yawed, heated. A squeal of metal 
began. Then the launch grated 
forward. Metal, stone and glass 
split and the ship burst out of the 
asteroid into space. 

^T^HE Inner Planets navy picked 
him up ninety thousand miles 
outside Mars orbit. After seven 
months of shooting war, the IP 
patrols were alert but reckless. 
When the launch failed to answer 
and give recognition countersigns, 
it should have been shattered with 
a blast and questions could have 
been asked of the wreckage later. 
But the launch was small and the 
cruiser crew was hot for prize 
money. 

They closed and grappled. 

They found Foyle inside, crawl- 
ing like a headless worm through 
a junkheap of spaceship and home 
furnishings. He was bleeding 
again, ripe with gangrene, and 
one side of his head was pulpy. 
They brought him into the sick 
bay aboard the cruiser and care- 
fully curtained his tank. Foyle 
was no sight even for the tough 
stomachs of lower-deck navy men. 

They patched his carcass in the 
amniotic tank while they com- 
pleted their tour of duty. On the 
jet back to Terra, Foyle recovered 
consciousness and bubbled words 
beginning with V. He knew he 
was saved. He knew that only 
time stood between him and 



vengeance. The sick-bay orderly 
heard him exulting in his tank 
and parted the curtains. Foyle’s 
filmed eyes looked up. The order- 
ly could not restrain his sickened 
curiosity. 

“You hear me, man?” he whis- 
pered. 

Foyle grunted. 

The orderly bent lower. “What 
happened? Who in hell done that 
to you?” 

“What?” Foyle croaked. 

“Don’t you know?” 

“What? What’s a matter, you?” 

“Wait a minute, is all.” 

The orderly disappeared as he 
jaunted to a supply cabin and 
reappeared alongside the tank 
five seconds later. Foyle struggled 
up out of the fluid. His eyes 
blazed. 

“It’s coming back, man. Some 
of it. Jaunte. I couldn’t jaunte 
on the Nomad, me." 

“What?” 

“I was off my head.” 

“Man, you didn’t have no head 
left, you.” 

“I cculdn’t jaunte. I forgot how, 
is all. I forgot everything, me. 
Still don’t really remember much.

He recoiled in terror as the 
orderly thrust the picture of a 
hideous tattooed face before him. 
It was a Maori mask. Cheeks, 
chin, nose and eyelids were deco- 
rated with stripes and swirls. 
Across the brow was blazoned

N $ MAD. Foyle stared, then 
cried out in agony. 

The picture was a mirror. 

The face was his own. 

RAVO, Mr. Harris! Well 
done! L-E-S, gentle- 
men. Never forget. Location. 
Elevation. Situation. That’s the 
only way to remember your 
jaunte coordinates. Don’t jaunte 
yet, Mr. Peters. Wait your turn. 
Be patient, you’ll all be C class 
by and by. Has anyone seen Mr. 
Foyle? He’s missing. Oh, look at 
that heavenly Brown Thrasher. 
Listen to him. Oh, dear. I’m think- 
ing all over the place ... or have 
I been speaking, gentlemen?” 

“Half and haif, ma’am.” 

“It does seem unfair. One-way 
telepathy is a nuisance. I do apol- 
ogize for shrapneling you with 
my thoughts.” 

“We like it, ma’am. You think 
pretty.” 

“How sweet of you, Mr. Gorgas. 
All right, class; all back to school 
and we start again. Has Mr. Foyle 
jaunted already? I never can keep 
track of him.” 

Robin Wednesbury was con- 
ducting her re-education class in 
jaunting on its tour through New 
York City, and it was a exciting 
a business for the cerebral cases 
as it was for the children in her 
primer class. She treated the 
adults like children and they 
rather enjoyed it. For the past 



month, they had been memoriz- 
ing jaunte stages at street inter- 
sections, chanting: “L-E-S, ma’am. 
Location. Elevation. Situation.” 

She was a tall, lovely Negro 
girl, brilliant and cultivated, but 
handicapped by the fact that she 
was a telesend, a one-way tele- 
path. She could broadcast her 
thoughts to the world, but could 
receive nothing. This was a dis- 
advantage that barred her from 
more glamorous careers, yet 
suited her for teaching. Despite 
her volatile temperament, Robin 
Wednesbury was a thorough and 
methodical jaunte instructor. 

The men were brought down 
from General War Hospital to 
the jaunte school, which occupied 
an entire building in the Hudson 
Bridge at 42nd Street. 

They started from the school 
and marched in a sedate crocodile 
to the vast Time Square jaunte 
stage, which they earnestly mem- 
orized. Then they all jaunted 
to the school and back to Times 
Square. 

The crocodile reformed and 
they marched up to Columbus 
Circle and memorized its coordi- 
nates. Then all jaunted back to 
school via Times Square and re- 
turned by the same route to 
Columbus Circle. 

Once more, the crocodile 
formed and off they went to 
Grand Army Plaza to repeat the 
memorizing and the jaunting.

~DOBIN was re-educating the 
-■■^patients (all head injuries 
who had lost the power to jaunte) 
to the express stops, so to speak, 
of the public jaunte stages. Later 
they would memorize the local 
stops at street intersections. 

As their horizons expanded 
(and their powers returned), they 
would memorize jaunte stages 
in widening circles, limited as 
much by income as ability, for 
one thing was certain: You had 
to actually see a place to memo- 
rize it, which meant you first had 
to pay for the transportation to 
get you there. Even 3-D photo- 
graphs would not do the trick. 
The Grand Tour had taken on 
a new significance for the rich. 

“Location. Elevation. Situation,” 
Robin Wednesbury lectured, and 
the class jaunted by express stages 
from Washington Heights to the 
Hudson Bridge and back again in 
primer jumps of a quarter-mile 
each, following their lovely Negro 
teacher earnestly. 

The little technical sergeant 
with the platinum skull suddenly 
spoke in the gutter tongue: “But 
there ain’t no elevation, ma’am. 
We’re on the ground, us.” 

“Isn’t, Sgt. Logan. ‘Isn’t any’ 
would be better. I beg your par- 
don. Teaching becomes a habit 
and I’m having trouble controlling 
my thinking today. The war news 
is so bad. We’ll get to Elevation 
when we start memorizing the 

30 



stages on top of skyscrapers, Sgt. 
Logan.” 

The man with the rebuilt skull 
digested that, then asked: “We 
hear you when you think, is a 
matter you?” 

“Exactly.” 

“But you don’t hear us?” 

“Never. I’m a one-way tele- 
path.” 

“We all hear you? Or just me, 
is all?” 

“That depends, Sgt. Logan. 
When I’m concentrating, only the 
one I’m thinking at; when I’m at 
loose ends, anybody and every- 
body . poor souls. Excuse me.” 
Robin turned and called: “Don’t 
hesitate before jaunting. Chief 
Harris. That starts doubting and 
doubting ends jaunting. Just step 
up and bang off.” 

“I worry sometimes, ma’am,” 
a chief petty officer with a tight- 
ly bandaged head answered. He 
was obviously stalling at the edge 
of the jaunte stage. 

“Worry? About what?” 

“Maybe there’s gonna be some- 
body standing where I arrive. 
Then there’ll be a hell of a real 
bang, ma’am.” 

“Now I’ve explained that a 
hundred times. Experts have 
gauged every jaunte stage in the 
world to accommodate peak traf- 
fic. That’s why private jaunte 
stages are small, while the Times 
Square stage is two hundred yards 
wide. It’s all been worked out

mathematically and there isn’t 
one chance in ten million of a 
simultaneous arrival. That’s less 
than your chance of being killed 
in a jet accident” 

bandaged C.P.O. nodded 
dubiously and stepped up on 
the raised stage. It was of white 
concrete, round, and decorated 
on its face with vivid black and 
white patterns as an aid to mem- 
ory. In the center was an illumi- 
nated plaque which gave its name 
and jaunte coordinates of latitude, 
longitude and elevation. 

At the moment when the band- 
aged man was gathering courage 
for his primer jaunte, the stage 
began to flicker with a sudden 
flurry of arrivals and departures. 
Figures appeared momentarily as 
they jaunted in, hesitated while 
they checked their surroundings 
and set new coordinates, and then 
disappeared as they jaunted off. 
At each disappearance, there was 
a faint ‘p)op’ as displaced air 
rushed into the space formerly 
occupied by a body. 

“Wait, class,” Robin called. “It’s 
rush hour. Everybody off the 
stage, please.” 

Laborers in heavy work clothes, 
still spattered with snow, were on 
their way south to their homes 
after a shift in the north woods. 
Fifty white-clad dairy clerks were 
headed west toward St. Louis. 
They followed the morning from 



the Eastern Time Zone to the 
Pacific Zone. And from eastern 
Greenland, where it was already 
noon, a horde of white-collar 
office workers was pouring into 
New York for their limch hour. 

“All right, class,” Robin called 
when the rush was over. “We’ll 
continue. Oh, dear, where is Mr. 
Foyle? He always seems to be 
missing.” 

“With a face like he’s got, him, 
you can’t blame him for hiding 
it, ma’am. Up in the cerebral 
ward, we call him Boogey.” 

“He does look dreadful, doesn’t 
he, Sgt. Logan? Can’t they get 
those marks off?” 

“They’re trying. Miss Robin, 
but they don’t know how yet. 
It’s called tattooing and it’s sort 
of forgotten, is all.” 

“Then how did Mr. Foyle ac- 
quire his face?” 

“Nobody knows. Miss Robin. 
He’s up in cerebral because he^s 
lost his mind, him. Can’t remem- 
ber nothing. Me, personal, if I 
had a face like that, I wouldn’t 
want to remember nothing, too.” 
“It’s a pity. He looks frightful. 
Sgt. Logan, do you suppose I’ve 
let a thought about Mr. Foyle 
slip and hurt his feelings?” 

The little man with the plati- 
num skull considered. “No, ma’am. 
You wouldn’t hurt nobody’s feel- 
ings, you. And Foyle ain’t got 
none to hurt, him. He’s just a big, 
dumb ox, is all.”

“I have to be so careful, Sgt. 
Logan. You see, no one likes to 
know what another person really 
thinks about him. We imagine 
that we do, but we don’t. This 
telesending of mine makes me 
loathed. And lonesome. I — please 
don’t listen to me. I’m having 
trouble controlling my thinking. 
Ah! There you are, Mr. Foyle. 
Where in the world have you 
been wandering?” 

'C'OYLE had jaunted in on the 
stage and stepped off quietly, 
his hideous face averted. “Been 
practicing, me,” he mumbled. 

Robin repressed the shudder 
of revulsion in her and went to 
him sympathetically. She took 
his arm. “You really should be 
with us more. We’re all friends 
and having a grand time. Please 
join in.” 

Foyle refused to meet her 
glance. As he pulled his arm 
away from her sullenly, Robin 
suddenly reali2ed that his sleeve 
was soaking wet. His entire hospi- 
tal uniform was drenched. 

“Wet? He’s been in the rain 
somewhere. But Tve seen the 
morning weather reports. No rain 
east of St. Louis. Then he must 
have jaunted farther than that. 
But he’s not supposed to be able. 
He’s supfK)sed to have lost all 
memory and ability to jaunte. 
He’s malingering.” 

Foyle leaped at her. “Shut up, 



you!” The savagery of his face 
was terrifying. 

“Then you are malingering.” 
“How much do you know?” 
“That yoxire a fool and you’re 
making a scene.” 

“Did they hear you?” 

“I dorft know. Let go of me.” 
Robin turned away from Foyle. 
“All right, class. We’re finished 
for the day. Now back to school 
for the hospital bus. You jaunte 
first, Sgt. Logan. Remember: 
L-E-S. Location. Elevation. Situa- 
tion . .” 

“What do you want?” Foyle 
growled. “A payoff, you?” 

“Be quiet. Stop making a scene. 
Now don’t hesitate, Chief Harris. 
Step up and jaunte off.” 

“I want to talk to you,” said 
Foyle. 

“Certainly not. Wait your turn, 
Mr. Peters. Don’t be in such a 
hurry.” 

“You going to report me in the 
hospital?” 

“Naturally.” 

“I want to talk to you.” 

“No.” 

“They gone now, all. We got 
time. I’ll meet you in your apart- 
ment.” 

“My apartment?” Robin was 
genuinely frightened. 

“In Green Bay, Wisconsin.” 
“This is absurd. I’ve got noth- 
ing to discuss with this —” 

“You got plenty. Miss Robin. 
You got a family to discuss.”

Foyle grinned at the terror she 
radiated. “Meet you in your apart- 
ment,” he repeated. 

“You can’t possibly know where 
it is,” she faltered. 

“Just told you, didn’t I?” 
“Y-you couldn’t possibly jaunte 
that far. You — ” 

“No?” The mask grinned. “You 
just told me I was mal — that 
word. You told the truth, you. 
We got half an hour. Meet you 
there.” 

"O OBIN Wednesbury’s apart- 
-*-^ment was in a massive build- 
ing set alone on the shore of 
Green Bay. The apartment house 
looked as though a magician had 
removed it from a city residential 
area and abandoned it amidst the 
Wisconsin pines. Buildings like 
this were a commonplace in the 
jaunting world. With self-con- 
tained heat and light plants, and 
jaunting to solve the transporta- 
tion problem, single and muliple 
dwellings were built in desert, 
forest and wilderness. 

The apartment itself was a four- 
room flat, heavily insulated to 
protect neighbors from Robin’s 
telesending. It was crammed with 
books, music, paintings and prints 
— all evidence of the cultured 
and lonely life of this unfortunate 
wrong-way telepath. 

Robin jaunted into the living 
room of the apartment a few 
seconds after Foyle, who was wait- 



ing for her with ferocious im- 
patience. 

“So now you know for sure,” 
he began without preamble. He 
seized her arm in a painful grip. 
“But you ain’t gonna tell nobody 
in the hospital about me. Miss 
Robin. Nobody.” 

“Let go of me!” Robin lashed 
him across his face. “Beast! Sav- 
age! Don’t you dare touch me!” 
Foyle released her and stepped 
back. The impact of her revulsion 
made him turn away angrily to 
conceal his face. 

“So you’ve been malingering,” 
she said. “You knew how to 
jaunte. You’ve been jaunting all 
the while you’ve been pretending 
to learn in the primer class, tak- 
ing big jumps around the country 
— around the world, for all I 
know.” 

“Yeah. I go from Times Square 
to Columbus Circle by way of 
. most anywhere. Miss Robin.” 
“And that’s why you’re always 
missing. But why? Why? What 
are you up to?” 

An expression of jx)ssessed cun- 
ning appeared on the hideous 
face. “I’m holed up in General 
Hospital, me. It’s my base of 
operations, see? I’m settling some- 
thing, Miss Robin. I got a debt 
to pay off, me. I had to find out 
where a certain ship is. Now I

stopped shouting and glared 
at her in wild triumph. Robin 
backed away in alarm. 

“For God’s sake, what are you 
talking about?” 

“Vorga. Vor^a-T: 1339. Ever 
hear of her. Miss Robin? I found 
out where she is from Bo’ness & 
Uig’s ship registry. Bo’ness fit Uig 
are out in SanFran. I went there, 
me, the time when you was learn- 
ing us the crosstown jaunte stages. 
Went out to SanFran, me. Found 
Vorga, me. She’s in Vancouver 
shipyards. She’s owned by Pre- 
steign of Presteign. Heard of him. 
Miss Robin? Presteign’s the big- 
gest man on Terra, is all. But he 
won’t stop me. Fll kill Vorga 
filthy. And you won’t stop me 
leither. Miss Robin.” 

Foyle thrust his face close to 
hers. “Because I cover myself. 
Miss Robin. I cover every weak 
spot down the line. I got some- 
thing on everybody who could 
stop me before I kill Vorga . 
including you. Miss Robin.” 

“No.” 

“Yeah. I found out where you 
live. They know up at the hospi- 
taL I come here and looked 
around. I read your diary. Miss 
Robin. You got a family on Cal- 
listo, motlwr and two sisters.” 
“For God’s sake!” 

“So that makes you an alien- 
belligerent. When the war started, 
you and all the rest was given 
one month to get out of the Inner 



Planets and go home. Any which 
didn’t became spies by law.” Foyle 
opened his hand. “I got you right 
here, girl.” He clenched his hand. 

“My mother and sisters have 
been trying to leave Callisto for 
a year and a half. We belong here. 
We -” 

“Got you right here,” Foyle 
repeated. “You know what they 
do to spies? They cut information 
out of them, Miss Robin. They 
take you apart, piece by piece — ” 
The Negro girl screamed. Foyle 
nodded happily and took her 
shaking shoulders in his hands. 
“I got you, is all, girl. You can’t 
even run from me because all I 
got to do is tip Intelligence and 
where are you? There ain’t noth- 
ing nobody can do to stop me; 
not the hospital or even Mr. Holy 
Mighty Presteign of Presteign.” 
“Get out, you filthy, hideous 
. thing. Get out!” 

“You don’t like my face. Miss 
Robin? There ain’t nothing you 
can do about that either.” 

Suddenly he picked her up and 
carried her to a deep couch. He 
threw her down on the couch. 
“Nothing,” he repeated. 

T^E VOTED to the principle of 
conspicuous waste, on which 
all society is based, Presteign of 
Presteign had fitted his Victorian 
mansion in Central Park with 
elevators, housephones, dumb- 
waiters and all the other labor-

saving devices which jaunting had 
made obsolete. The servants in 
that giant gingerbread castle 
walked dutifully from room to 
room, op>ening and closing doors 
and climbing stairs. 

Presteign of Presteign arose, 
dressed with the aid of his valet 
and barber, descended to the 
morning room with the aid of an 
elevator, and breakfasted, assisted 
by a butler, footman and wait- 
resses. He left the morning room 
and entered his study. In an^age 
when communication systems 
were virtually extinct — when it 
was far easier to jaunte directly 
to a man’s office for a discussion 
than to telephone or telegraph — 
Presteign still maintained an an- 
tique telephone switchboard with 
operator in his study. 

“Get me Dagenham,” he said. 

*'■ ■’HE operator struggled and 
put a call through to Dagen- 
ham Couriers, Inc. This was a 
hundred-million-credit organiza- 
tion of bonded jaunters set up 
to perform any public or confi- 
dential service for any principal. 
Their fee was Cr 1 per mile. 
Dagenham guaranteed to get a 
courier around the world in eighty 
minutes. 

Eighty seconds after Presteign’s 
call was put through, a Dagenham 
courier appeared on the private 
jaunte stage outside Presteign’s 
home, was identified and admit- 



ted through the jaunteproof laby- 
rinth behind the entrance. Like 
every member of the Dagenham 
staff, he was an M class jaunter, 
capable of teleporting a thousand 
miles a jump indefinitely, and 
familiar with innumerable jaunte 
coordinates. He was a senior spe- 
cialist in chicanery and cajolery, 
trained to the incisive efficiency 
and boldness that characterized 
Dagenham Couriers and -eflected 
the ruthlessness of its founder. 

“Presteign?” he said, wasting no 
time on protocol. 

“I want to hire Dagenham.” 
“Ready, Presteign.” 

“Not you. I want Saul Dagen- 
ham himself.” 

“Mr. Dagenham no longer gives 
personal service for less than Cr 
100 , 000 .” 

“The amount will be five times 
that.” 

“Fee or percentage?” 

“Both. Quarter of a million fee, 
and a quarter of a million guaran- 
teed against ten p>er cent of the 
total amount at risk.” 

“Agreed. The matter?” 

“PyrE.” 

“Spell it, please.” 

“The name means nothing to

“No.” 

“Good. It will to Dagenham.

courier produced a tiny 
silver pearl, a memo-bead, 
repeated Presteign’s instructions 
into it, and left without another 
word. 

Presteign turned to his tele- 
phone operator. “Get me Regis 
Sheffield.” 

Ten minutes after the call went 
through to Regis Sheffield’s law 
office, a young law clerk appeared 
on Presteign’s private jaunte 
stage, was vetted and admitted 
through the maze. He was a 
bright young man with a scrubbed 
face and the expression of a de- 
lighted rabbit. 

“Excuse the delay, Presteign,” 
he said. “We got your call in 
Chicago and I’m still only a D 
class five-hundred-miler. Took me 
a while getting here.” 

“Is your chief trying a case in 
Chicago?” 

“Chicago, New York and Wash- 
ington. He’s been on the jaunte 
from court to court all morning. 
We fill in for him when he’s in 
another court.” 

“I want to retain him.” 
“Honored, Presteign, but Mr. 
Sheffield’s pretty busy.” 

“Not too busy for PyrE.” 
“Sorry, sir, I don’t quite — ” 
“No, you don’t, but Sheffield 
will. Just tell him PyrE, as in 



funeral pyre, and the amoimt of 
his fee.” 

“Which is?” 

“Quarter of a million retainer 
and a quarter of a million guaran- 
teed against ten per cent of the 
total amount at risk.” 

“And what performance is re- 
quired of Mr. Sheffield?” 

“To prepare every known legal 
device for kidnaping a man and 
holding him against the army, the 
navy and the police.” 

“Quite. And the man?” 
“Gulliver Foyle.” 

The law clerk muttered quick 
notes into a memo-bead, nodded 
and departed. 

Presteign left the study and 
ascended the plush-carpeted stairs 
to his daughter’s suite to pay his 
morning respects. 

In the homes of the wealthy, 
the rooms of the female members 
were blind, without windows or 
doors, open only to the jaunting 
of intimate members of the fam- 
ily. Thus was morality main- 
tained and chastity defended. But 
since Olivia Presteign was herself 
blind to normal sight, she could 
not jaunte. Consequently her suite 
was entered through doors closely 
guarded by ancient retainers in 
the Presteign clan livery. 

O LIVIA PRESTEIGN was a 
glorious albino. Her hair was 
white silk, her skin was white 
satin, her nails, her lips and her 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



37 



eyes were coral. She was beauti- 
ful and blind in a wonderful 
way, for she could see in the 
infra-red only, from 7,500 Ang- 
stroms to one-millimeter wave- 
lengths. She saw heat waves, 
magnetic fields, radio waves, 
radar, sonar and electromagnetic 
fields. 

She was holding her Grand 
Levee in the drawing room of the 
suite. She sat in a brocaded wing 
chair, sipping tea, guarded by her 
duenna, holding court, chatting 
with a dozen men and women 
standing about the room. She 
looked like an exquisite statue 
of marble and coral, her blind 
eyes flashing as she saw and yet 
did not see. 

She saw the drawing room as 
a pulsating flow of heat emana- 
tions ranging from hot highlights 
to cool shadows. She saw the daz- 
zling magnetic patterns of clocks, 
phones, lights and locks. She saw 
and recognized people by the 
characteristic heat patterns radi- 
ated by their faces and bodies. 
She saw, around each head, an 
aura of the faint neural brain 
pattern, and sparkling through 
the heat radiation of each body, 
the ever-changing mitogenetic 
tone of muscle and nerve. 

Presteign did not care for the 
artists, musicians and fops Olivia 
kept about her, but he was pleased 
to see a scattering of society nota- 
bles this morning. There was a 

Z8 



Sears-Roebuck; a Gillette; young 
Sidney Kodak, who would one 
day be Kodak of Kodak; a Houbi- 
gant; Buick of Buick; and R. H. 
Macy XVI, head of the powerful 
Saks-Gimbel clan. 

Presteign paid his respects to 
his daughter and left the house. 
He set off for his clan head- 
quarters at 99 Wall Street in a 
coach and four driven by a coach- 
man assisted by a groom, both 
wearing the Presteign trademark 
of red, black and blue. That black 
“P” on a field of scarlet and 
cobalt was one of the most an- 
cient and distinguished trade- 
marks in the social register, rival- 
ing the “57” of the Heinz clan 
and the “RR” of the Rolls-Royce 
dynasty in antiquity. 

The head of the Presteign clan 
was a familiar sight to New York 
jaunters. Iron-gray, handsome, 
powerful, impeccably dressed and 
mannered in the old-fashioned 
style, Presteign of Presteign was 
the epitome of the socially elect, 
for he was so exalted in station 
that he employed coachmen, 
grooms, hostlers, stableboys and 
horses to perform a function for 
him which ordinary mortals per- 
formed by jaunting. 

As men climbed the social 
ladder, they displayed their jxjsi- 
tion by their refusal to jaunte. 
The newly adopted into a great 
commercial clan rode an expen- 
sive bicycle. A rising clansman 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



drove a small sports car. The 
captain of a sept was transported 
in a chauffeur-driven antique from 
the old days, a vintage Bentley 
or Cadillac or a towering La- 
gonda. An heir-presumptive in 
direct line of succession to the 
clan chieftainship staffed a yacht 
or a plane. 

Presteign of Presteign, head of 
the clan Presteign, owned car- 
riages, cars, yachts, planes and 
trains. His position in society was 
so lofty that he had not jaunted 
in forty years. Secretly, he scorned 
the bustling new-rich like the 
Dagenhams and Sheffields, who 
still jaunted and were unashamed. 

P RESTEIGN entered the cren- 
elated keep at 99 Wall Street 
that was Castle Presteign. It was 
staffed and guarded by his fa- 
mous Jaunte Watch, all in clan 
livery. Presteign walked with the 
stately gait of a chieftain as they 
piped him to his office. Indeed he 
was grander than a chieftain, as 
an importunate government offi- 
cial awaiting audience discovered 
to his dismay. That unfortunate 
man leaped forward from the 
waiting crowd of p>etitioners when 
Presteign passed. 

“Mr. Presteign,” he began, “I’m 
from the Internal Revenue De- 
partment. I must see you this 
morn — ” 

Presteign cut him short with 
an icy stare. “There are thousands 



of Presteigns. All are addressed 
as Mister. But I am Presteign 
of Presteign, head of house and 
sept, first of the family, chieftain 
of the clan. I am addressed as 
Presteign. Not ‘Mister’ Presteign. 
Presteign.” 

He turned and entered his 
office, where his staff greeted him 
with a muted chorus: “Good 

morning, Presteign.” 

Presteign nodded, smiled his 
basilisk smile and seated himself 
behind the enthroned desk while 
the Jaunte Watch skirled their 
pipes and ruffled their drums. 
Presteign signaled for the audi- 
ence to begin. The Household 
Exjuerry stepped forward with a 
scroll, for Presteign disdained 
memo-beads and all mechanical 
business devices. 

“Report on Clan Presteign en- 
terprises,” the Equerry began. 
“Common Stock: High-2 0 1 Vi 

Low-201 Vi. Average quotations 
New York, Paris, Ceylon, To- 
kyo 

Presteign waved his hand irri- 
tably. The Equerry retired to be 
replaced by Black Rod. 

“Another Mr. Presto to be in- 
vested, Presteign.” 

Presteign restrained his impa- 
tience and went through the tedi- 
ous ceremony of swearing jn the 
497th Mr. Presto in the hierarchy 
of Presteign Prestos who managed 
the shops in the Presteign retail 
division. Until recently, the man 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



39 



had had a face and body of his 
own. Now, he was ready to join 
the Prestos. 

After six months of surgery and 
psycho-conditioning, he was iden- 
tical to the other 496 Mr. Prestos 
and to the idealized portrait of 
Mr. Presto which hung behind 
Presteign’s dais ... a kindly, 
honest man resembling Abraham 
Lincoln, a man who instantly in- 
spired affection and trust. Around 
the world, purchasers entered an 
identical Presteign store and were 
greeted by an identical manager, 
Mr. Presto. 

He was rivaled, but not sur- 
passed, by the Kodak clan’s Mr. 
Kwik and Montgomery Ward’s 
Uncle Monty. 

YI^HEN the ceremony was com- 
" pleted, Presteign arose 
abruptly to indicate that the pub- 
lic investiture was ended. The 
office was cleared of all but the 
high officials. Presteign paced, ob- 
viously repressing his seething 
impatience. He never swore, but 
his restraint was more terrifying 
than profanity. 

“Foyle,” he said in a suffocated 
voice. “A common sailor. Dirt. 
Dregs. Gutter scum. But that man 
stands between me and — ” 

“If you please, Presteign,” Black 
Rod interrupted timidly, “it’s 
eleven o’clock, Eastern time; eight 
o’clock, Pacific time.” 

“What?” 



“If you please, Presteign, may 
I remind you that there is a 
launching ceremony at nine. 
Pacific time? You are to preside 
at the Vancouver shipyards.” 

“Launching?” 

“Our new freighter, the Pres- 
teign Princess. It will take some 
time to establish three-dimen- 
sional broadcast contact with the 
shipyard, so we had better — ” 

“I will attend in person.” 

“In person!” Black Rod fal- 
tered. “But we cannot possibly fly 
to Vancouver in an hour, Pres- 
teign. We — ” 

“I will jaunte,” Presteign of 
Presteign snapped, such was his 
agitation. 

His appalled staff made hasty 
preparations. Messengers jaunted 
ahead to warn the Presteign offices 
across the country and the private 
jaunte stages were cleared. Pres- 
teign was ushered to the stage 
within his New York office. It was 
a circular platform in a black- 
hung room without windows — a 
masking and concealment neces- 
sary to prevent unauthorized per- 
sons from discovering and memor- 
izing coordinates. For the same 
reason, all homes and offices had 
one-way windows and confusion 
labyrinths behind their doors. 

To jaunte, it was necessary 
(among other things) for a man 
to know exactly where he was 
and where he was going, or there 
was little hope of arriving any- 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



where alive. It was as imp)Ossjble 
to jaunte from an undetermined 
starting point as it was to arrive 
at an unknown destination. Like 
shooting a pistol, one had to know 
where to aim and which end of 
the gun to hold. But a glance 
through a window or door might 
be enough to enable a man to 
memorize the L-E-S coordinates 
of a place. 

TjRESTEIGN stepped on the 
stage, visualized the coordi- 
nates of his destination in the 
Philadelphia office, seeing the pic- 
ture clearly and the position accu- 
rately. 

He relaxed and energized one 
concentrated thrust of will and 
belief toward the target. 

He jaunted. 

There was a dizzy moment in 
which his eyes blurred. The New 
York stage faded out of focus; 
the Philadelphia stage blurred 
into focus. There was a sensation 
of falling down, and then up. 

He arrived. 

Black Rod and others of his 
staff arrived a respectful moment 
later. 

So, in iauntes of one and two 
hundred miles each, Presteign 
crossed the continent and arrived 
outside the Vancouver shipping 
yards at exactly nine o’clock in 
the morning. Pacific time. He had 
left New York at eleven A.M. He 
had gained two hours of daylight. 



This, too, was a commonplace 
in a jaunting world. 

The square mile of imfenced 
concrete — what fence could bar 
a jaunter? — comprising the ship- 
yard looked like a white table 
covered with black pennies neat- 
ly arranged in concentric circles. 
But on closer approach, the pen- 
nies enlarged into the hundred- 
foot mouths of black pits dug 
deep into the Elarth. Each circular 
mouth was rimmed with concrete 
buildings, offices, check rooms, 
canteens, changing rooms. 

These were the takeoff and 
landing pits, the drydock and con- 
struction pits, of the shipyards. 
Spaceships, like sailing vessels, 
were never designed to support 
their own weight unaided against 
the drag of gravity. Normal ter- 
ran gravity would crack the spine 
of a spaceship. 

The ships were built in deep 
pits, standing vertically in a net- 
work of catwalks and construction 
grids, braced and supported by 
anti-gravity screens. They took 
off from similar pits, riding the 
anti-grav beams upward, like 
motes mounting the vertical shaft 
of a searchlight, until at last they 
reached the Roche Limit and 
could thrust with their own jets. 
Landing spacecraft cut drive jets 
and rode the same beams down- 
ward into the pits. 

As the Presteign entourage en- 
tered the Vancouver yards, they 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



41 



could see which of the pits were 
in use. From some, the noses and 
hulls of spaceships extruded, 
raised quarterway or halfway 
above ground by the anti-grav 
screens as workmen in the pits 
below brought their aft sections 
to particular operational levels. 

Three Presteign V-class trans- 
ports, Ve^B, Vestal and Vorga, 
stood partially raised near the 
center of the yards, undergoing 
flaking and replating, as the heat- 
lightning flicker of torches around 
Vorga indicated. 

A t the concrete building 
marked ENTRY, the Pres- 
teign entourage stopped before a 
sign that read: you are en- 
dangering YOUR LIFE IF YOU 
ENTER THESE PREMISES UNLAW- 
FULLY. You HAVE BEEN WARNED! 
Visitor badges were distributed to 
the party and even Presteign of 
Presteign received one. He duti- 
fully pinned it on, for he well 
knew what the result of entering 
without such a protective badge 
would be. The entourage contin- 
ued, winding its way through pits 
until it arrived at 0-3, where the 
pit-mouth was decorated with 
bunting in the Presteign colors 
and a small grandstand had been 
erected. 

Presteign was welcomed and, 
in turn, greeted his various offi- 
cials. The band struck up the clan 
song, bright and brassy, but one 

42 



of the instruments appeared to 
have gone insane. It struck a 
brazen note that blared louder 
and louder until it engulfed the 
entire band and the surprised ex- 
clamations. Only then did Pres- 
teign realize that it was not an 
instrument, but the shipyard 
alarm. 

An intruder was in the yard, 
someone not wearing an identi- 
fication or visitor’s badge. The 
radar field of the protection sys- 
tem was tripped and the alarm 
sounded. Through the raucous 
bellow of the alarm, Presteign 
could hear a multitude of ‘Pops’ 
as the yard guards jaunted from 
the grandstand and took positions 
around the square mile of con- 
crete field. His own Jaunte Watch 
closed in around him, looking 
wary and alert. 

A voice began blaring on the 
P.A., coordinating defense. “UN- 
KNOWN IN YARD. UN- 
KNOWN IN YARD AT E FOR 
EDWARD NINE. E FOR ED- 
WARD NINE MOVING WEST 
ON FOOT.” 

“Someone must have broken 
in!” Black Rod shouted. 

“I’m aware of that,” Presteign 
answered calmly. 

“He must be a stranger if he 
isn’t jaunting into here.” 

“I’m aware of that also.” 

“UNKNOWN APPROACH- 
ING D FOR DAVID FIVE. D 
FOR DAVID FIVE. STILL ON 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



FOOT. D FOR DAVID FIVE 
ALERT.” 

“What in God’s name is he up 
to?” Black Rod exclaimed. 

“You are familiar with my rule, 
sir,” Presteign said coldly. “No 
associate of the Presteign clan 
may take the name of the Divin- 
ity in vain. You forget yourself.” 
“UNKNOWN NOW AP- 
PROACHING C FOR CHAR- 
LEY FIVE. NOW APPROACH- 
ING C FOR CHARLEY FIVE.” 
Black Rod touched Presteign’s 
arm. “He’s coming this way, Pres- 
teign. Will you take cover, 
please?” 

“I will not.” 

“Presteign, there have been 
assassination attempts before. 
Three of them. If — ” 

“How do I get to the top of 
this stand?” 

“Presteign!” 

“Help me up.” 

A IDED by Black Rod, who was 
still protesting hysterically, 
Presteign climbed to the top of 
the grandstand to watch the 
power of the Presteign clan in 
action against danger. Below, he 
could see workmen in white jump- 
ers swarming out of the pits to 
gape at the excitement. Guards 
were app>earing as they jaunted 
from distant sectors toward the 
focal point of the action. 

“UNKNOWN MOVING 
SOUTH TOWARD B FOR 



BAKER THREE. B FOR 
BAKER THREE.” 

Presteign watched the B-3 pit. 
A figure appeared, dashing swift- 
ly toward the pit, veering, dodg- 
ing, bulling forward. It was a 
giant man in hospital blues with 
a wild thatch of black hair and 
a distorted face that appeared, in 
the distance, to be painted in 
livid colors. His clothes were flick- 
ering like heat lightning as the 
protective induction field of the 
defense system seared him. 

“B FOR BAKER THREE 
ALERT. B FOR BAKER 
THREE CLOSE IN.” 

There were shouts and a dis- 
tant rattle of shots, the pneumatic 
whine of scope guns. Half a dozen 
workmen in white leaped for the 
intruder. He scattered them and 
streaked on and on toward B-3, 
where the nose of Vorga showed. 
He was a lightning bolt driving 
through workmen and guards, piv- 
oting, striking, whipping forward 
implacably. 

Suddenly he stopped, reached 
inside his flaming jacket and with- 
drew a black canister. With the 
convulsive gesture of an animal 
writhing in death-throes, he bit 
the end of the canister and hurled 
it, straight and true on a high arc 
toward Vorga. The next instant, 
he was struck down. 

“EXPLOSIVE. TAKE 
COVER. EXPLOSIVE. TAKE 
COVER. COVER!” 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



43 



“Presteign!” Black Rod 
squawked. 

Presteign shook him off and 
watched the canister curve up and 
then down toward the nose of 
Vorga, spinning and glinting in 
the cold sunlight. At the edge of 
the pit, it was caught by the 
anti-grav beam and flicked up>- 
ward as by a giant invisible 
thumbnail. Up and up and up it 
whirled, one hundred, five hun- 
dred, a thousand feet. Then there 
was a blinding flash, and an in- 
stant later a titanic clap of 
thunder that smote ears and jarred 
teeth and bone. 

Presteign picked himself up 
and descended the grandstand to 
the launching podium. He placed 
his finger on the launching button 
of the Presteign Princess. 

“Bring me that man, if he’s 



still alive,” he told Black Rod. 
He pressed the button. “I christen 
thee — the Presteign Power.”

^ I ’HE star chamber in Castle 
-*■ Presteign was an oval room 
with ivory panels picked out with 
gold, high mirrors and stained glass 
windows. It contained a gold or- 
gan with robot organist by Tif- 
fany, a gold-tooled library with 
android librarian on library lad- 
der, a Louis Quinze desk with 
android secretary before a manual 
memo-bead recorder, an Ameri- 
can bar with robot bartender. 
Presteign would have preferred 
the ostentation of having human 
servants, but androids and robots 
kept secrets. 

“Be seated. Captain Yeovil,” 



44 



6AIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




he said courteously. “This is Mr. 
Regis Sheffield, representing me 
in this matter. That young man 
is Mr. Sheffield’s assistant.” 

“Bunny’s my portable law li- 
brary,” Sheffield grunted. 

Presteign touched a control. 
The still-life in the star chamber 
came alive. The organist played, 
the librarian sorted books, the 
secretary typed, the bartender 
shook drinks. It was spectacular. 
And the impact, carefully calcu- 
lated by industrial psychome- 
trists, established control for 
Presteign and put visitors at a 
disadvantage. 

“You spoke of a man named 
Foyle, Captain Yeovil?” Presteign 
prompted. 

Captain Peter Y’ang-Yeovil of 
Central Intelligence was a lineal 
descendant of the learned Men- 



cius and belonged to the Intelli- 
gence Tong of the Inner Planets 
Armed Forces. For two hundred 
years, the IPAF had entrusted its 
Intelligence work to the Chinese 
who, with a five-thousand-year 
history of cultivated subtlety be- 
hind them, had achieved wonders. 
Captain Y’ang-Yeovil was a mem- 
ber of the dreaded Society of 
Paper Men, an adept of the Tient- 
sin Image Makers, a Master of 
Superstition, and fluent in the 
Secret Speech. He did not look 
Chinese. 

Y’ang-Yeovil hesitated, fully 
aware of the psychological pres- 
sures operating against him. He 
examined Presteign’s ascetic, 
basilisk face; Sheffield’s blunt, 
aggressive expression; and the 
eager young man named Bunny 
whose rabbit features had an un- 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



45 




mistakable Oriental cast. It was 
necessary for Yeovil to establish 
control or effect some sort of 
compromise. 

He opened with a flanking 
movement. “Are we related any- 
where within fifteen degrees of 
consanguinity?” he asked Bunny 
in the Mandarin dialect. “I am of 
the house of the learned Meng- 
Tse, whoin the barbarians call 
Mencius.” 

“Then we are hereditary ene- 
mies,” Bunny answered in falter- 
ing Mandarin. “For the formidable 
ancestor of my line was deposed 
as governor of Shan-tung in 342 
B.C. by the falsely honored Earth- 
pig Meng-Tse.” 

“With all courtesy, I shave your 
ill-formed eyebrows,” Y’ang- Yeo- 
vil said. 

“Most respectfully, I singe your 
snaggle teeth.” Bunny laughed. 

“Come, sirs,” Presteign pro- 
tested. 

“We are reaffirming a three- 
thousand-year blood feud,” Y’ang- 
Yeovil explained to Presteign, 
who looked sufficiently unsettled 
by the conversation and the 
laughter which he did not under- 
stand. 

Y ’ANG- YEOVIL tried a direct 
thrust. “When will you be 
finished with Foyle?” 

“What Foyle?” Sheffield asked. 
“What Foyle have you got?” 
“There are thirteen of that 



name associated with the clan 
Presteign.” 

“An interesting number. Did 
you know I was a Master of 
Superstitution? Some day I must 
show you the Mirror-And-Listen 
Mystery. I refer to the Foyle in- 
volved in a reported attempt on 
Mr. Presteign’s life this morning.” 

“Presteign,” Presteign corrected. 
“I am not ‘Mister.’ I am Presteign 
of Presteign.” 

“Three attempts have been 
made on Presteign’s life,” Shef- 
field said. “You’ll have to be more 
sp>ecific.” 

“Three this morning? Presteign 
must have been busy.” Y’ang- 
Yeovil sighed. Sheffield was prov- 
ing himself a resolute opponent. 
The Intelligence man tried 
another diversion. “I do wish our 
Mr. Presto had been more spe- 
cific.” 

“Your Mr. Presto!” Presteign 
exclaimed. 

“Oh, yes. Didn’t you know one 
of your five hundred Prestos was 
an agent of ours? That’s odd. We 
took it for granted you’d find out 
and went ahead with a confusion 
ojjeration.” 

Presteign looked appalled. 

Y’ang-Yeovil crossed his legs 
and continued to chat breezily. 
“That’s the basic weakness in 
routine Intelligence procedure — 
you start finessing before finesse 
is required.” 

“He’s bluffing,” Presteign burst 



46 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



out. “None of our Prestos could 
possibly have any knowledge of 
Gulliver Foyle.” 

“Thank you.” Y’ang-Yeovil 
smiled. “That’s the Foyle I want. 
When can you let us have him?” 
Sheffield scowled at Presteign 
and then turned on Y’ang-Yeovil. 
“Who’s ‘us’?” he demanded. 
“Central Intelligence.” 

“Why do you want him?” 

“Do you make love to a wo- 
man before or after you have 
been introduced?” 

“That’s a damned impertinent 
question.” 

“And so was yours. When can 
you let us have Foyle?” 

“When you show cause.” 

“To whom?” 

“To me.” Sheffield hammered a 
heavy forefinger against his palm. 
“This is a civilian matter concern- 
ing civilians. Unless war materiel, 
war personnel, or the strategy and 
tactics of a war-in-being are in- 
volved, civilian jurisdiction shall 
always prevail.” 

“303 Terran Appeals 191,” mur- 
mured Bunny. 

“The Nomad was carrying war 
materiel.” 

“The Nomad was transporting 
platinum bullion to Mars Bank,” 
Presteign snapped. “If money is 
a — ” 

“/ am leading this discussion,” 
Sheffield interrupted. He swung 
around on Y’ang-Yeovil. “Name 
the war materiel.” 



' I ^HIS blunt challenge knocked 
Y’ang-Yeovil off balance. He 
knew that the crux of the Nomad 
situation was the presence on board 
ship of 20 pounds of PyrE, the to- 
tal world supply, which was prob- 
ably irreplaceable now that its dis- 
coverer had disappeared. He knew 
that Sheffield realized that they 
both knew this. He had assumed 
that Sheffield would prefer to keep 
PyrE unnamed. And yet here was 
the challenge to name the unname- 
able. 

He attempted to meet bluntness 
with bluntness. “All right, gentle- 
men, I’ll name it now. The Nomad 
was transpK)rting twenty pounds of 
a substance called PyrE.” 

Presteign started; Sheffield si- 
lenced him. “What’s PyrE?” 
“According to our reports — ” 
“From Presteign’s Mr. Presto?” 
“Oh, that was bluff.” Y’ang-Yeo- 
vil laughed and momentarily 
gained control. “According to In- 
telligence, PyrE was developed for 
Presteign by a man who subse- 
quently vanished. PyrE is a Misch 
Metal, a pyrophore. That’s all we 
know for a fact. But we’ve had 
vague reports about it — unbeliev- 
able reports from reputable 
agents. If a fraction of our infer- 
ences are correct, PyrE could 
make the difference between vic- 
tory and defeat.” 

“Nonsense. No war materiel has 
ever made that much difference.” 
“No? I cite the fission bomb of

installations of 2022. Talley’s All- 
Field Radar Trip Screen of 2194. 
Materiel can often make the dif- 
ference, especially when there’s 
the chanbe of the enemy getting it 
first.” 

“There’s no such chance now.” 

“Thank you for admitting the 
importance of PyrE.” 

“I admit nothing; I deny every- 
thing.” 

“Central Intelligence is pre- 
pared to offer an exchange. A man 
for a man. The inventor of PyrE 
for Gully Foyle.” 

“You’ve got him?” Sheffield de- 
manded. “Then why badger us for 
Foyle?” 

“Because we’ve got a corpse!” 
Yeovil flared. “The CXiter Satel- 
lites command had him on Lassell 
for six months, trying to carve in- 
formation out of him. We pulled 
him out with a raid at a cost of 
seventy-nine per cent casualties. 
We rescued a corpse. We still don’t 
know if the Outer Satellites were 
having a cynical laugh at our ex- 
pense, letting us recapture a body. 
We still don’t know how much 
they ripped out of him.” 

13RESTEIGN sat sharply up- 
right at this. His merciless fin- 
gers tapped slowly and sharply. 

“Damn it!” Y’ang-Yeovil 
stormed. “Can’t you recognize a 
crisis, Sheffield? We’re on a tight- 
rope. What the devil are you doing 

AS 



backing Presteign in this shabby 
deal? You’re the leader of the Lib- 
eral party — Terra’s arch-patriot. 
You’re Presteign’s jxjlitical arch- 
enemy. Sell him out, you fool, be- 
fore he sells us all out.” 

“Captain Yeovil,” Presteign 
broke in with icy venom, “these re- 
marks cannot be countenanced.” 
“We want and need PyrE,” 
Y’ang-Yeovil continued. “We’ll 
have to investigate that twenty 
pounds of PyrE, rediscover the 
synthesis, learn to apply it to the 
war effort . and all this before 
the O.S. beat us to the punch, if 
they haven’t already. But Pres- 
teign refuses to coo{)erate. Why? 
Because he’s opposed to the party 
in power. He wants no military vic- 
tories for the Liberals. He’d rather 
we lost the war for the sake of 
politics because men like Pres- 
teign never lose. Come to your 
senses, Sheffield. You’ve been re- 
tained by a traitor. What in God’s 
name are you trying to do?” 
Before Sheffield could answer, 
there was a discreet tap on the 
door of the Star Chamber and Saul 
Dagenham was ushered in. Time 
was when Dagenham had been one 
of the Inner Planets’ research wiz- 
ards, a physicist with inspired in- 
tuition, total recall, and a sixth- 
order computer for a brain. But 
there had been an accident at 
Tycho Sands and the fission blast 
that should have killed him did 
not. Instead, it turned him danger- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ously radioactive; it transformed 
him into a 25th century “Typhoid 
Mary.” 

He was paid Cr 25,000 a year by 
the Inner Planets government to 
take precautions which they 
trusted him to carry out. He 
avoided physical contact with any 
person for more than five minutes 
per day. He could not occupy any 
room, not his own, for more than 
thirty minutes a day. Commanded 
and paid by the IP to isolate him- 
self, Dagenham had abandoned re- 
search and built the colossus of 
Dagenham Couriers, Inc. 

When Y’ang-Yeovil saw the 
short blond cadaver with leaden 
skin and death’s-head smile enter 
the Star Chamber, he knew he 
was assured of defeat in this en- 
counter. He was no match for the 
three men together. He arose at 
once. 

“I’m getting an Admiralty order 
for Foyle,” he said. “As far as In- 
telligence is concerned, all negoti- 
ations are ended. From now on, 
it’s war.” 

“Captain Yeovil is leaving,” 
Presteign called to the Jaunte 
Watch officer who had guided 
Dagenham in. “Please see him out 
through the maze.” 

Y’ang-Yeovil waited until the 
officer stepped alongside him and 
bowed. Then, as the man courte- 
ously motioned to the door, Y’ang- 
Yeovil looked directly at Pres- 
teign, smiled ironically and 



disappeared with a faint ‘pop.’ 
“Presteign!” Bunny exclaimed. 
“He jaunted. This room isn’t blind 
to him. He — ” 

“Evidently,” Presteign said. “In- 
form the Master of the House- 
hold,” he instructed the amazed 
Watch officer. “The coordinates of 
the Star Chamber are no longer 
secret. They must be changed 
within twenty-four hours. And 
now, Mr. Dagenham — ” 

“One minute,” said Dagenham. 
“There’s that Admiralty order.” 

W ITHOUT apology or expla- 
nation, Dagenham disap- 
peared, too. Presteign raised his 
eyebrows. 

“Another party to the Star 
Chamber secret,” he murmured- 
“But at least he had the tact to 
conceal his knowledge until the 
secret was out.” 

Dagenham reappeared. “No 
point wasting time going through 
the motions of the maze,” he said. 
“I’ve given orders in Washington. 
They’ll hold Yeovil up; two hours 
guaranteed, three hours probable, 
four hours possible.” 

“How will they hold him up?” 
Bunny asked. 

Dagenham gave him his deadly 
smile. “Standard FFCC Operation 
of Dagenham Couriers — fun, fan- 
tasy, confusion, catastrophe. We'll 
need all four hours. Damn! Fve 
disrupted your dolls, Presteign.” 
The robots were suddenly caper-

ing in lunatic fashion as Dagen- 
ham’s hard radiation pene- 
trated their electronic systems. 
“No matter. I’ll be on my way.” 
“Foyle?” Presteign demanded. 
“Nothing yet.” Dagenham 
grinned his death’s-head smile. 
“He’s really imique. I’ve tried all 
the standard drugs and routines 
on him. Nothing. Outside, he’s just 
an ordinary spaceman — if you 
forget the tattoo on his face — but 
inside he’s got steel guts. Some- 
thing’s got hold of him and he 
won’t give.” 

“What’s got hold of him?” Shef- 
field asked. 

“I hope to find out.” 

“How?” 

“Don’t ask; you’d be an acces- 
sory. Have you got a ship ready, 
Presteign?” 

Presteign nodded. 

“I’m not guaranteeing there’ll 
be any Nomad for us to find, but 
we’ll have to get a jump on the 
navy if there is. Law ready, Shef- 
field?” 

“Ready. I’m hoping we won’t 
have to use it.” 

“I’m hoping, too; but again, I’m 
not guaranteeing. All right, stand 
by for instructions. I’m on my 
way to crack Foyle.” 

“Where have you got him?” 
Dagenham shook his head. 
“This room isn’t secure.” He dis- 
appeared. 

He jaunted Cincinnati-New Or- 
leans-Monterrey to Mexico City, 



where he appeared in the Psychi- 
atry Wing of the giant hospital of 
the Combined Terran Universi- 
ties. ‘Wing’ was hardly an ade- 
quate name for this section, which 
occupied an entire city in the 
metropolis that was the hospital. 

He jaunted up to the 43rd floor 
of the Therapy Division and 
looked into the isolated tank 
where Foyle floated, imconscious. 

D agenham glanced at the 
distinguished bearded gen- 
tleman in attendance. “Hello, 
Fritz.” 

“Hello, Saul.” 

“Hell of a thing, the head of 
psychiatry minding a patient for 
me.” 

“I think we owe you favors, 
Saul.” 

“You still brooding about 
Tycho Sands, Fritz? I’m not. Am 
I lousing your wing with radia- 
tion?” 

“I’ve had everything shielded.” 
“Ready for the dirty work?” 

“I wish I knew what you were 
after.” 

“Information.” 

“And you have to turn my ther-. 
apy department into an inquisi- 
tion to get it?” 

“That was the idea.” 

“Why not use ordinary drugs?” 
“Tried them already. No good. 
He’s not an ordinary man.” 

“You know this is illegal.” 

“I know. Changed your mind?

Want to back out? I can dupli- 
cate your equipment for a quar- 
ter of a million.” 

“No, Saul. We’ll always owe 
you favors.” 

“Then let’s go. Nightmare 
Theater first.” 

They trundled the tank down a 
corridor and into a hundred-feet- 
square padded room. It was one 
of therapy’s by-passed experi- 
ments. Nightmare Theater had 
been an early attempt to shock 
schizophrenics back into the ob- 
jective world by rendering the 
fantasy world into which they 
were withdrawing uninhabitable. 
But the shattering and laceration 
of patients’ emotions had proved 
to be too cruel and dubious a 
treatment. 

For Dagenham’s sake, the head 
of psychiatry had dusted off the 
3D visual projectors and recon- 
nected all sensory projectors. 
They decanted Foyle from his 
tank, gave him a reviving shot 
and left him in the middle of the 
floor. They removed the tank, 
turned off the lights and entered 
the concealed control booth. 
There they turned on the pro- 
jectors. 

Every child in the world imag- 
ines that its fantasy world is 
unique to itself. Psychiatry knows 
that the joys and terrors of private 
fantasies are a common heritage 
shared by all mankind. Fears, 
guilts, terrors and shames could 



be interchanged, from one man to 
the next, and none would notice 
the difference. The therapy de- 
partment at Combined Hospital 
had recorded thousands of emo- 
tional tapes and boiled them 
down to one all-inclusive, all-ter- 
rifying performance in Nightmare 
Theater. 

I^OYLE awoke, panting and 
sweating, and never knew that 
he had awakened. He was in the 
clutch of the serpent-haired, 
bloody-eyed Eumenides. He was 
pursued, entrapped, precipitated 
from heights, burned, flayed, bow- 
stringed, vermin-covered, de- 
voured. He screamed. He ran. 
The radar Hobble-Field in the 
Theater clogged his steps and 
turned them into the ghastly 
slow -motion of dream - nmning. 
And through the cacophony of 
grinding, shrieking, moaning, pur- 
suing that assailed his ears mut- 
tered the thread of a persistent 
voice. 

“Where is Nomad where is 
Nomad where is Nomad where is 
Nomad where is Nomad?” 

“Vorga,” Foyle croaked. 
“Vor^a.” 

He had been inoculated by his 
own fixation. His own nightmare 
had rendered him immune. 

“Where is Nomad? where have 
you left Nomad? what happened 
to Nomad? where is Nomad?” 

“ For ^a.'” Foyle shouted. “Vorga.” 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION

In the control booth, Dagen- 
ham swore. The head of psychia- 
try, monitoring the projectors, 
glanced at the clock. “One min- 
ute and forty-five seconds, Saul. 
He can’t stand much more.” 

“He’s got to break. Give him 
the final effect.” 

They buried Foyle alive, slowly, 
inexorably, hideously. He was car- 
ried down into black depths and 
enclosed in stinking slime that cut 
off light and air. He slowly suffo- 
cated while a distant voice 
boomed : 

“WHERE IS NOMAD? 
WHERE HAVE YOU LEFT 
NOMAD? YOU CAN ESCAPE 
IF YOU FIND NOMAD. 
WHERE IS NOMAD?” 

But Foyle was back aboard 
Nomad in his lightless, airless 
coffin, floating comfortably be- 
tween deck and roof. He curled 
into a tight fetal ball and pre- 
pared to sleep. He was content. 
He would escape. He would find 
VoT^a. 

“Impervious bastard!” Dagen- 
ham swore. “Has anyone ever re- 
sisted Nightmare Theater before, 
Fritz?” 

“Not many. You’re right— that’s 
an uncommon man, Saul.” 

“He’s got to be ripped open. To 
hell with any more of this. We’ll 
try the Megal Mood next. Are 
the actors ready?” 

“All ready.” 

“Then let’s go.” 



There are six directions in 
which delusions of grandeur can 
run. The Megal (short for mega- 
lomania) Mood was therapy’s 
dramatic diagnosis technique for 
establishing and plotting the par- 
ticular course of megalomania. 

Foyle awoke in a luxurious 
four-poster bed. He was in a bed- 
room, hung with brocade, papered 
in velvet. He glanced around cu- 
riously. Soft sunlight filtered 
through latticed windows. Across 
the room, a valet was quietly lay- 
ing out clothes. 

“Hey!” Foyle grunted. 

^I^HE valet turned. “Good morn- 
ing, Mr. Fourmyle,” he mur- 
mured. 

“What?” 

“It’s a lovely morning, sir. I’ve 
laid out the brown twill and the 
cordovan pumps, sir.” 

“What’s a matter, you?” 

“I’ve — ” The valet gazed at 
Foyle curiously. “Is anything 
wrong, Mr. Fourmyle?” 

“What you call me, man?” 

“By your name, sir.” 

“My name is — Fourmyle?” 
Foyle struggled up in the bed. 
“No, it’s not. It’s Foyle. Gully 
Foyle, that’s my name, me.” 

The valet bit his lip. “One mo- 
ment, sir . .” 

He stepped outside and called. 
A lovely girl in white came run- 
ning into the bedroom and sat 
down on the edge of the bed. She

took Foyle’s hands and gazed into 
his eyes. Her face was distressed. 

“Darling, darling, darling,” she 
whispered. “You aren’t going to 
start all that again, are you? The 
doctor swore you were over it.” 
“Start what again?” 

“All that Gulliver Foyle non- 
sense about your being a common 
sailor and—” 

“I am Gully Foyle. That’s my 
name — Gully Foyle.” 

“Sweetheart, you’re not. That’s 
just a delusion you’ve had for 
weeks. You’ve been overworking 
and drinking too much.” 

“Been Gully Foyle all my life, 
me.” 

“Yes, I know, darling. That’s 
the way it’s seemed to you. But 
you’re not. You’re Geoffrey Four- 
myle. The Geoffrey Fourmyle. 
You’re— Oh, what’s the sense in 
telling you? Get dressed, my love. 
You’ve got to come downstairs. 
Your office has been frantic.” 
Foyle permitted the valet to 
dress him and went downstairs in 
a daze. 

The lovely girl, who evidently 
adored him, conducted him 
through a giant studio littered 
with drawing tables, easels and 
half-finished canvases. She took 
him into a vast hall filled with 
desks, file cabinets, stock tickers, 
clerks, secretaries, office person- 
nel. They entered a lofty labora- 
tory cluttered with glass and 
chrome. Burners flickered and 



hissed; bright-colored liquids bub- 
bled and churned; there was a 
pleasant odor of interesting chem- 
icals and odd experiments. 

“What’s 'all this?” Foyle asked. 

The girl seated Foyle in a 
plush armchair alongside a giant 
desk littered with interesting pa- 
pers scribbled with fascinating 
symbols. On some, Foyle saw the 
name ‘Geoffrey Fourmyle,’ 
scrawled in an imposing, authori- 
tative signature. 

“There’s some crazy kind of 
mistake, is all,” Foyle said. 

The girl silenced him. “Here’s 
Doctor Regan. He’ll explain.” 

A N impressive gentleman with 
a crisp, comforting manner 
came to Foyle, touched his pulse, 
inspected his eyes, and nodded in 
satisfaction. 

“Good,” he said. “Excellent. 
You are close to complete recov- 
ery, Mr. Fourmyle. Now you will 
listen to me for a moment, eh?” 

Foyle nodded. 

“You remember nothing of the 
past. You have only a false mem- 
ory. You were overworked. You 
are an impxjrtant man and there 
were too many demands on you. 
You started to drink heavily a 
month ago — No, no, denial is use- 
less. You drank. You lost your- 
self.”

myle, an infantile attempt to es- 
cape responsibility. You imagined 
you were a common spaceman 
named Foyle. Gulliver Foyle, 
yes? With an odd number—” 

“Gully Foyle, AS : 128/127 : 006. 
But that’s me. That’s — ” 

“It is not you. This is you.” 
Dr. Regan waved at the interest- 
ing offices they could see through 
the transparent glass wall. “You 
can only recapture the true mem- 
ory if you discharge the old. All 
this glorious reality is yours, if 
we can help you discard the 
dream of the spaceman.” 

Dr. Regan leaned forward, his 
jx)lished spectacles glittering hyp- 
notically. “Reconstruct this false 
memory of yours in detail and I 
will tear it down. Where do you 
imagine you left the spaceship 
Nomad? How did you escape? 
Where do you imagine the No- 
mad is now?” 

Foyle wavered before the ro- 
mantic glamor of the scene which 
seemed to be just within his 
grasp. 

“It seems me, I left Nomad out 
in -” 

He stopped short. 

A devil-face peered at him from 
the highlights reflected in Dr. Re- 
gan’s spectacles ... a hideous 
tiger mask with N $ mad blaz- 
oned across the distorted brow. 
Foyle stood up. 

“Liars,” he growled. “It’s real, 
me. This here is phony. What 



happened to me is real. Tm real, 
me.” 

Saul Dagenham walked into 
the laboratory. “All right,” he said. 
“Strike the set. It’s a washout.” 

The bustling scene in labora- 
ory, office and studio ended. The 
actors quietly disappeared with- 
out another glance at Foyle. 

Dagenham gave Foyle his 
deadly smile. “Tough, aren’t you? 
You’re really unique. My name is 
Saul Dagenham. We’ve got five 
minutes for a talk. Come into the 
garden.” 

^^HE Sedative Garden atop the 
Therapy Building was a tri- 
umph of therapeutic planning. 
Every {perspective, every color, 
every contour had been designed 
to placate hostility, soothe resis- 
tance, melt anger, evaf>orate hys- 
eria, absorb melancholia and de- 
pression. 

“Sit down,” Dagenham said, 
pointing to a bench alongside a 
pool in which crystal waters tin- 
kled. “I’ll have to walk around a 
bit. Can’t come too close to you. 
I’m ‘hot.’ D’you know what that 
means?” 

Foyle shook his head sullenly. 
Dagenham cupp>ed both hands 
around the flaming blossom of an 
orchid and held them there for a 
moment. “Watch that flower.” 

He paced up a path and turned 
suddenly. “You’re right, of course. 
Everything that happened to you

is real — only what did happen?” 
“Go to hell,” Foyle growled. 
“You know, Foyle, I admire 
you.” 

“Go to hell.” 

“In your own primitive way, 
you’ve got ingenuity and guts. 
I’ve been checking on you. That 
bomb you threw in the Presteign 
shipyards was lovely, and you 
nearly wrecked General Hospital 
getting the money and material 
together.” Dagenham counted fin- 
gers. “You looted lockers, stole 
from the blind ward, stole drugs 
from the pharmacy, stole appa- 
ratus from the lab stockrooms.” 
“Go to hell, you.” 

“But what have you got against 
Presteign? Why’d you try to blow 
up his shipyard? They tell me 
you broke in and went tearing 
through the pits like a wild man. 
What were you trying to do, 
Foyle?” 

“Go to hell.” 

Dagenham smiled. “If we’re go- 
ing to chat, you’ll have to hold up 
your end better than that. Your 
conversation’s getting monoto- 
nous. What happened to Nomad?” 
“I don’t know about Nomad, 
nothing.” 

“The ship was last reported 
over seven months ago. Are you 
the sole survivor? And what have 
you been doing all this time? 
Having your face decorated?” 

“I don’t know about Nomad, 
nothing.” 



“No, Foyle, that won’t do. You 
show up with Nomad tattooed 
across your face. Freshly tattooed. 
Intelligence checks and finds you 
were aboard Nomad when she 
sailed. Foyle, Gulliver: AS: 128/ 
127:006, Mechanic’s Mate, 3rd 
Class. As if all this isn’t enough 
to throw Intelligence into a tizzy, 
you come back in a private 
launch that’s been missing fifty 
years. Man, you’re cooking in the 
reactor. Intelligence wants the an- 
swers to all these questions. And 
you ought to know how Cenral 
Intelligence butchers its answers 
out of people.” 

Foyle started. 

D agenham nodded as he 

saw his point sink home. 
“That’s why I think you’ll listen 
to reason. We want information, 
Foyle. I tried to trick it out of you; 
admitted. I failed because you’re 
too tough; admitted. Now I’m of- 
fering you an honest deal. We’ll 
protect you if you’ll cooperate. If 
you don’t, you’ll spend five years 
in an Intelligence lab having in- 
formation chopped out of you.” 

It was not the prospect of the 
butchery that frightened Foyle, 
but the thought of the loss of free- 
dom. A man had to be free to 
avenge himself; to raise money 
and find Vor^a again; to rip and 
tear and gut Vorga. 

“What kind of deal?” he asked. 
“Tell us what happened to No-

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



mad and where you left her.” 
“Why, man?” 

“Why? Because of the salvage, 
man.” 

“There ain’t nothing to salvage. 
She’s a wreck, is all.” 

“Even a wreck’s salvageable.” 
“You mean you’d jet way out 
there to pick up pieces? Don’t 
joker me, man.” 

“All right,” Dagenham said in 
exasperation. “There’s the cargo.” 
“She was split wide open. No 
cargo left.” 

“It was a cargo you don’t know 
about,” Dagenham said confiden- 
tially. “Nomad was transporting 
platinum bullion to Mars Bank. 
Every so often, banks have to ad- 
just accounts. Normally, enough 
trade goes on between planets so 
that accounts can be balanced on 
paper. The war’s disrupted nor- 
mal trade and Mars Bank found 
that Presteign owed them twenty- 
odd million credits without any 
way of getting the money short of 
actual delivery. Presteign was de- 
livering the money in bar plati- 
num aboard the Nomad. It was 
locked in the purser’s safe.” 

“Twenty million,” Foyle whis- 
pered. 

“Give or take a few thousand. 
The ship was insured, but that 
just means that the underwriters, 
Bo’ness and Uig, get the salvage 
rights and they’re even tougher 
than Presteign. However, there’ll 
be a reward for you. Say, twenty 



thousand credits — lump sum.” 

“Twenty million,” Foyle whis- 
pered again. 

“We’re assuming that an O.S. 
raider caught up with Nomad 
somewhere on course and let her 
have it. They couldn’t have 
boarded and looted or you 
wouldn’t have been left alive. This 
means that the purser’s safe is 
still — Are you listening, Foyle?” 

But Foyle was not listening. 
He was seeing twenty millions — 
not twenty thousand— twenty mil- 
lions in platinum bullion as a 
broad highway to Vorga. No more 
petty thefts from lockers and 
labs; twenty millions for the tak- 
ing and the razing of Vorga. 

“Foyle!” 

1^0 YLE awoke. He looked at 
Dagenham. “I don’t know 
about Nomad, nothing,” he said. 

“What the hell’s got into you 
now? Why’re you dummying up 
again?” 

“I don’t know about Nomad, 
nothing.” 

“I’m offering a fair reward. A 
spaceman can go on a hell of a 
tear with twenty thousand credits 
— a one-year tear. What more do 
you want?” 

“I don’t know about Nomad, 
nothing.” 

“It’s us or Intelligence, Foyle.” 

“You ain’t so anxious for them 
to get me or you wouldn’t be 
flipping through all this. But it

ain’t no use, anyway. I don’t know 
about Nomad, nothing.” 

“You son of a—” Dagenham 
tried to repress his anger. He had 
revealed just a little too much to 
this cunning, primitive creature. 
“You’re right, Foyle. We’re not 
anxious for Intelligence to get 
you. But we’ve made our own 
preparations.” His voice hardened. 
“You think you can dummy up 
and stand us off. You think you 
can leave us to whistle for No- 
mad, You’ve even got an idea 
of beating us to the salvage.” 
“No,” Foyle said. 

“Now listen to this. We’ve got 
a lawyer waiting in New York. 
He’s got a criminal prosecution 
for piracy pending against you; 
piracy in space, murder and loot- 
ing. We’re going to throw the 
book at you. Presteign will get a 
conviction in twenty-four hours. 
If you’ve got a criminal record of 
any kind, that means a lobotomy. 
They’ll bum out half your brain 
to stop you from ever jaunting 
again.” 



Dagenham stopped and glow- 
ered at Foyle. When Foyle shook 
his head, Dagenham continued. 

“If you haven’t got a record, 
they’ll hand you ten years of what 
is laughingly known as medical 
treatment. We don’t punish crim- 
inals in our enlightened age; we 
cure ’em — and the cure is worse 
than punishment. They’ll stash 
you in a black hole in one of the 
cave hospitals. You’ll be kept in 
permanent darkness and solitary 
confinement so you can’t jaunte 
out. They’ll go through the mo- 
tions of giving you shots and ther- 
apy, but you’ll be rotting in the 
dark. You’ll stay there and rot 
until you decide to talk. So make 
up your mind.” 

“I don’t know nothing about 
Nomad. Nothing!” Foyle said. 

“All right,” Dagenham spat. 
Suddenly he pointed to the orchid 
blossom he had enclosed with his 
hands. It was blighted and shriv- 
eled. “That’s what’s going to hap- 
pen to you.”

MAN OF DISTINCTION 

By MICHAEL SHAARA 



Being unique is a matter of 
pride — but being a complete 
mathematical impossibility? 

Illustrated By DICK FRANCIS 



T he remarkable distinction 
of Thatcher Blitt did not 
come to the attention of a 
bemused world until late in the 
year 2180. Although Thatcher 
Blitt was, by the standards of his 
time, an extremely successful 
man financially, this was not con- 
sidered real distinction. Unfortu- 
nately for Blitt, it never has 
been. 

The history books do not re- 

MAN OF DISTINCTION 



cord the names of the most suc- 
cessful merchants of the past un- 
less they happened by chance to 
have been connected with fa- 
mous men of the time. Thus 
Croesus is remembered largely 
for his contributions to famous 
Romans and successful armies. 
And Haym Solomon, a similarly 
wealthy man, would have been 
long forgotten had he not also 
been a financial mainstay of the 

59 



American Revolution and con- 
sorted with famous, if impover- 
ished, statesmen. 

So if Thatcher Blitt was dis- 
tinct among men, the distinction 
was not immediately apparent. 
He was a small, gaunt, fragile 
man who had the kind of face 
and bearing that are perfect for 
movie crowd scenes. Absolutely 
forgettable. Yet Thatcher Blitt 
was one of the foremost business- 
men of his time. For he was pres- 
ident and founder of that noble 
institution. Genealogy, Inc. 

Thatcher Blitt was not yet 25 
when he made the discovery 
which was to make him among 
the richest men of his time. His 
discovery was, like all great ones, 
obvious yet profound. He ob- 
served that every person had a 
father. 

C ARRYING on with this 
thought, it followed inevi- 
tably that every father had a fa- 
ther, and so on. In fact, thought 
Blitt, when you considered the 
matter rightly, everyone alive 
was the direct descendant of un- 
told numbers of fathers, down 
through the ages, all descending, 
one after another, father to son. 
And so backward, unquestion- 
ably, into the unrecognizable and 
perhaps simian fathers of the 
past. 

This thought, on the face of 
it not particularly profound, 

60 



struck young Blitt like a blow. 
He saw that since each man had 
a father, and so on and so on, it 
ought to be possible to construct 
the genealogy of every person 
now alive. In short, it should be 
possible to trace your family 
back, father by father, to the be- 
ginning of time. 

And of course it was. For that 
was the era of the time scanner. 
And with a time scanner, it would 
be possible to document your 
family tree with perfect accu- 
racy. You could find out exactly 
from whom you had sprung. 

And so Thatcher Blitt made 
his fortune. He saw clearly at 
the beginning what most of us 
see only now, and he patented 
it. He was aware not only of the 
deep>-rooted sense of snobbish- 
ness that exists in many people, 
but also of the simple yet pro- 
found force of curiosity. Who ex- 
actly, one says to oneself, was 
my forty-times-great-great-grand- 
father? A Roman Legionary? A 
Viking? A pyramid builder? One 
of Xenophon’s Ten Thousand? 
Or was he, perhaps (for it is al- 
ways possible), Alexander the 
Great? 

Thatcher Blitt had a product 
to sell. And sell he did, for other 
reasons that he alone had noted 
at the beginning. The races of 
mankind have twisted and turned 
with incredible complexity over 
the years; the numbers of peo-

pie have been enormous. 

With thirty thousand years in 
which to work, it was impossible 
that there was not, somewhere 
along the line, a famous ancestor 
for everybody. A minor king 
would often suffice, or even a 
general in some forgotten army. 
And if these direct ancestors were 
not enough, it was fairly simple 
to establish close blood kinship 
with famous men. The blood lines 
of Man, you see, begin with a 
very few people. In all of ancient 
Greece, in the time of Pericles, 
there were only a few thousand 
families. 

Seeing all this, Thatcher Blitt 
became a busy man. It was nec- 
essary not only to patent his idea, 
but to produce the enormous 
capital needed to found a large 
organization. The cost of the time 
scanner was at first prohibitive, 
but gradually that obstacle was 
overcome, only for Thatcher to 
find that the government for 
many years prevented him from 
using it. Yet Blitt was indomita- 
ble. And eventually, after years 
of heart-rending waiting. Geneal- 
ogy, Inc., began operations. 

¥T WAS a tremendous success. 

Within months, the very 
name of the company and its 
taut slogan, “An Ancestor for 
Everybody,” became household 
words. There was but one im- 
mediate drawback. It soon be- 

62 



came apparent that, without go- 
ing back very far into the past, 
it was sometimes impossible to 
tell who was really the next fa- 
ther in line. The mothers were 
certain, but the fathers were 
something else again. This was 
a ponderable point. 

But Blitt refused to be dis- 
couraged. He set various elec- 
tronic engineers to work on the 
impasse and a solution was found. 
An ingenious device which tested 
blood electronically through the 
scanner — based on the different 
sine waves of the blood groups — 
saved the day. That invention 
was the last push Genealogy, Inc, 
was ever to need. It rolled on to 
become one of the richest and, 
for a long while, most exclusive 
corporations in the world. 

Yet it was still many years be- 
fore Thatcher Blitt himself had 
time to rest. There were patent 
infringements to be fought, new 
developments in the labs to be 
watched, new ways to be found 
to make the long and arduous 
task of father-tracing easier and 
more economical. Hence he was 
well past sixty when he at last 
had time to begin considering 
himself. 

He had become by this time 
a moderately offensive man. Sur- 
rounded as he had been all these 
years by pomp and luxury, by 
impressive names and extraordi- 
nary family trees, he had suc- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



cumbed at last He became un- 
bearably name-conscious. 

He began by regrouping his 
friends according to their ances- 
tries. His infrequent parties were 
characterized by his almost Par- 
liamentarian system of seating. 
No doubt, all this had been in 
Thatcher Blitt to begin with — 
it may well be, in perhaps vary- 
ing quantities, in all of us — but it 
grew with him, prospered with 
him. Yet in all those years he 
never once inspected his own 
forebears. 

You may well ask, was he 
afraid? One answers, one does 
not know. But at any rate, the 
fact remains that Thatcher Blitt, 
at the age of 67, was one of the 
few rich men in the world who 
did not know who exactly their 
ancestors had been. 

A ND so, at last, we come to 
the day when Thatcher 
Blitt was sitting alone in his of- 
fice, one languid hand draped va- 
cantly over his brow, listening 
with deep satisfaction to the hum 
and click of the enormous oper- 
ations which were going on in 
the building around him. 

What moved him that day re- 
mains uncertain. Perhaps it was 
that, from where he was sitting, 
he could see row upon row of 
action pictures of famous men 
which had been taken from his 
time scanners. Or perhaps it was 



simply that this profound ques- 
tion had been gnawing at him 
all these years, deeper and deep- 
er, and on this day broke out into 
the light 

But whatever the reason, at 
11:02 that morning, he leaped 
vitally from his chair. He sum- 
moned Cathcart, his chief assist- 
ant, and gave him the immortal 
command. 

“Cathcart!” he grated, stung to 
the core of his being. “Who am 
I?” 

Cathcart rushed off to find out. 

There followed some of the 
most taut and fateful days in the 
brilliant history of Genealogy, 
Inc. Father-tracing is, of course, 
a painstaking business. But it 
was not long before word had be- 
gun to filter out to interested 
people. 

The first interesting discovery 
made was a man called Blott, in 
eighteenth century England. (No 
explanation was ever given for 
the name’s alteration from Blott 
to Blitt. Certain snide individuals 
took this to mean that the name 
had been changed as a means to 
avoid prosecution, or some such, 
and immediately began making 
light remarks about the Blotts 
on old Blitt’s escutcheon.) This 
Blott had the distinction of hav- 
ing been a wineseller of consider- 
able funds. 

This reputedly did not sit well 
with Thatcher Blitt. Merchants,

he snapped, however successful, 
are not worthy of note. He want- 
ed empire builders. He wanted, 
at the very least, a name he had 
heard about. A name that ap- 
peared in the histories. 

His workers furiously scanned 
back into the past. 

Months went by before the 
next name appeared. In 9th cen- 
tury England, there was a wan- 
dering minstrel named John (last 
name unprintable) who achieved 
considerable notoriety as a bal- 
lad singer, before dying an un- 
natural death in the boudoir of 
a lady of high fashion. Although 
the details of this man’s life were 
of extreme interest, they did not 
impress the old man. He was, on 
the contrary, rather shaken. A 
minstrel. And a rogue to boot. 

There were shakeups in Gene- 
alogy, Inc. Cathcart was replaced 
by a man named Jukes, a highly 
competent man despite his inter- 
esting family name. Jukes forged 
ahead full steam past the birth 
of Christ (no relation). But he 
was well into ancient Egypt be- 
fore the search began to take on 
the nature of a crisis. 

U P UNTIL then, there was 
simply nobody. Or to be 
more precise, nobody but nobod- 
ies. It was incredible, all the laws 
of chance were against it, but 
there was, actually, not a single 
ancestor of note. And no way of 

64 



faking one, for Thatcher Blitt 
couldn’t be fooled by his own 
methods. What there was was 
simply an unending line of peas- 
ants, serfs, an occasional foot sol- 
dier or leather worker. Past John 
the ballad-singer, there was no 
one at all worth reporting to the 
old man. 

This situation would not con- 
tinue, of course. There were so 
few families for men to spring 
from. The entire Gallic nation, 
for example, a great section of 
present-day France, sprang from 
the family of one lone man in 
the north of France in the days 
before Christ. Every native 
Frenchman, therefore, was at 
least the son of a king. It was 
impossible for Thatcher Blitt to 
be less. 

So the hunt went on from day 
to day, past ancient Greece, past 
Jarmo, past the wheel and metals 
and farming and on even past all 
civilization, outward and back- 
ward into the cold primordial 
wastes of northern Germany. 

And still there was nothing. 
Though Jukes lived in daily fear 
of losing his job, there was noth- 
ing to do but press on. In Ger- 
many, he reduced Blitt’s ancestor 
to a slovenly little man who was 
one of only three men in the en- 
tire tribe, or family, one of three 
in an area which now contains 
millions. But Blitt’s ancestor, true 
to form, was simply a member of 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the tribe. As was his father be- 
fore him. 

Yet onward it went. Westward 
back into the French caves, 
southward into Spain and across 
the unrecognizable Mediterra- 
nean into a verdant North Africa, 
backward in time past even the 
Cro-Magnons, and yet ever back- 
ward, 30,000 years, 35,000, with 
old Blitt reduced now practically 
to gibbering and still never an 
exceptional forebear. 

There came a time when Jukes 
had at last, inevitably, to face the 
old man. He had scanned back 
as far as he could. The latest an- 
cestor he had unearthed for Blitt 
was a hairy creature who did 
not walk erect. And yet, even 
here, Blitt refused to concede. 

“It may be,” he howled, “it 
must be that my ancestor was 
the first man to walk erect or 
light a fire — to do something.” 

It was not until Jukes pointed 
out that all those things had been 
already examined and found 
hopeless that Blitt finally gave 
in. Blitt was a relative, of course, 
of the first man to stand erect, 
the man with the first human 



brain. But so was everybody else 
on the face of the Earth. There 
was truly nowhere else to ex- 
plore. What would be found now 
would be only the common his- 
tory of mankind. 

Blitt retired to his chambers 
and refused to be seen. 

^ I 'HE story went the rounds, as 
such stories will. And it was 
then at last, after 40,000 years 
of insignificance, that the name 
of Blitt found everlasting distinc- 
tion. The story was picked up, 
fully documented, by psycholo- 
gists and geneticists of the time, 
and inserted into textbooks as a 
profound commentary on the 
forces of heredity. The name of 
Thatcher Blitt in particular has 
become famous, has persisted un- 
til this day. For he is the only 
man yet discovered, or ever likely 
to be discovered, with this partic- 
ular distinction. 

In 40,000 years of scanner-re- 
corded history, the blood line of 
Blitt (or Blott) never once pro- 
duced an exceptional man. 

That record is unsurpassed.

By WILLY LEY 



THE ANIMAL IN THE FOOTNOTES 

O N THE 12th of Novem- 
ber, 1850, an unknown 
animal entered the annals 
of science in the most dignified 
and respectable manner possible. 
In the evening of that day, a 
meeting of the Royal Zoological 
Society of London took place and 
the main paper was read by Dr. 
Gideon Algernon Mantell, a fa- 
mous geologist and paleontologist. 
Doctor Mantell had news from 
New Zealand, which had been 







GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




sent to him by his own son, who 
had been collecting. 

The main news of the evening 
dealt with a bird. 

A few years earlier, Walter 
Mantell had sent the remains of 
a bird to his father, stating that 
this must be the bird which was 
called Moho by the Maoris of the 
North Island and Takahe by the 
Maoris of the South Island. 

The Maoris had said that this 
bird could not fly, even though it 
had wings. They had described it 
and said that they had eaten it 
while it was still around. After 
scientific examination of the re- 
mains it had been called Notornis 
mantelli. 

But now. Dr. Mantell was able 
to announce, something could be 
added: Notornis mantelli was still 
aliv.e. At any event, his son had 
secured the carcass of a freshly 
killed bird. It was about the size 
of a goose. 

A S many readers may know, 
this Takahe was thought to 
be extinct since about 1900, but 
was discovered alive on the west 
shore of Lake Te Anau on the 
South Island. It is now as strictly 
protected as is humanly possible. 

But Dr. Mantell had more 
news to tell that night: 

It may not be irrelevant to add, 
that in the course of Mr. Walter 
Mantell’s journey from Banks’ Pen- 
insula along the coast to Otago, he 



learnt from the natives that they 
believed there still existed in that 
country the only indigenous terres- 
trial quadruped, except a species of 
rat, which there are reasonable 
grounds for concluding New Zealand 
ever possessed. While encamping at 
Arowenua in the district of Timaru, 
the Maoris assured him that about 
ten miles inland there was a quad- 
ruped which they called Kaureke, 
and that it was formerly abundant, 
and often kept by their ancestors in 
a domestic state as a pet animal. It 
was described as about two feet in 
length, with coarse grisly hair; and 
must have more nearly resembled 
the Otter or Badger than the Beaver 
or the Ornithorhynchus (platypus), 
which the first accounts seemed to 
suggest as the probable type. The 
offer of a liberal reward induced 
some of the Maoris to start for the 
interior of the country where the 
Kaureke was supposed to be lo- 
cated, but they returned without 
having obtained the slightest trace 
of the existence of such an animal; 
my son, however, expresses his be- 
lief in the native accounts, and that 
if the creature no longer exists, its 
extermination is of a very recent 
date. 

This is the earliest printed 
statement in which the mysteri- 
ous mammal is even mentioned. 
An earlier writer on New Zea- 
land’s natural history, Ernest 
Dieffenbach, M.D., the naturalist 
of the New Zealand Company, 
had stated in his book Travels in 
New Zealand (London, 1843) 
that “no terrestrial beast has been 
found wild in these Islands, nor 
do any app)ear to be known to the 
natives.”

The fact is that the only native 
mammals of New Zealand are 
two bats. One of them is closely 
related to an Australian form; the 
other is typical for New Zealand 
only. Locally, they are distin- 
guished as the long-tailed and the 
short-tailed bat, with the explana- 
tion that the long-tailed bat has 
short ears while the short-tailed 
bat is long-eared. 

^ I HE Maoris told that when 
they arrived in Ao-tea-roa 
(“long white cloud” or “long shin- 
ing land,” their name for New 
Zealand) from Hawa-iki (their 
original home, most probably the 
island of Raiatea, about 120 miles 
to the northwest of Tahiti ) in the 
canoes Tainui, Takitimu, Te 
Arawa, Mata-atua, Kurhaupo and 
Tokomaru they brought dogs 
with them which they kept as 
livestock. The main wave of the 
Maori migration to New Zealand 
must have been around 1350 A.D., 
but the dog, now extinct, was still 
mentioned by Captain James 
Cook as one of the two mammals 
hp saw. The other was a black 
rat which was rare even then — 
the Maoris ate it, too. 

I have to digress from Dr. Man- 
tell’s unknown “indigenous terres- 
trial quadruped” for a moment to 
say a little more about that black 
rat. No doubt it was there, for it 
even received a scientific name, 
Mus maorium, or Maori rat. The 



Maori name for it was Kiore. 

But one expert claimed around 
1860 that he could not find a dif- 
ference between the Maori rat 
and the common Pacific species 
of rat Mus exulans. And Alfred 
Russell Wallace points out in his 
once-famous book Island Lite 
(London, 1892) that whenever a 
man caught a black rat and the 
Maoris jubilantly declared that 
this was a true Kiore (in the 
meantime, other European rats 
had arrived by ships from Eng- 
land, much against the wishes of 
everybody), it turned out to be 
either a European black rat or 
else an Australian rat which had 
arrived as a stowaway on ships 
from Australia. 

The story of Dr. Mantell’s un- 
known quadruped moved on to 
several other names. The name of 
the explorer in question is now 
in most books as Sir Julius von 
Haast, but he was born in Bonn 
on the Rhine (where his father 
was Burgomaster) as Johann 
Franz Julius von Haast. And he 
did not see New Zealand until 
the age of 36, when he arrived in 
Auckland on December 21st, 
1858. 

He became famous as a geolo- 
gist. He discovered an important 
pass through the mountains of the 
South Island which still bears his 
name. He located coal and gold 
and founded the Philosophical In- 
stitute of Canterbury, New Zea- 



68 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



land. But he kept telling friends 
that, because of his beautiful and 
strong voice, he had wanted to 
become an opera singer — presum- 
ably his dignified father had 
something to say about that am- 
bition— and that he had played 
the violin in the symphony or- 
chestra of Diisseldorf under the 
baton of Felix Mendelssohn. 

Sir Julius learned a new name 
for the unknown mammal. The 
Maoris called it Waitoreke, or 
Waitoreki, or Waitoteke. I haven’t 
been able to find out anywhere 
whether this name can be trans- 
lated, but I found in Dieffenbach 
a glossary of Maori words and 
learned that waipa means river, 
waikeri means either swamp or 
rivulet, wairere means waterfall, 
waikare means clear water and 
waitangi (a place name) means 
noisy water. 

Waitoreke obviously has some- 
thing to do with water. Maybe 
the name just means “lives in 
water” or something like that. 

¥ N 1857, the Austrian geologist 
* Ferdinand von Hochstetter 
embarked on the Novara for a 
lorg trip of exploration. He came 
to New Zealand and made friends 
with Dr. Julius von Haast. Two 
years after his return to Austria, 
von Hochstetter started to assem- 
ble his notes on New Zealand for 
a book and asked von Haast 
whether anything new could be 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



reported. The reply was printed 
in his book in a footnote reading: 

My friend Haast writes to me 
about the Waitoreki under the date 
of the 6th of June 1861 as follows: 
“3500 feet above sea level I saw at 
the upper Ashburton River (South 
Island, Province of Canterbury), in 
an area where no human foot ever 
walked before me, its tracks on 
many occasions. The tracks resemble 
those of our European otter but are 
somewhat smaller. The animal itself 
was seen by two gentlemen who ow.n 
a sheep ranch at the shore of Lake 
Heron in the neighborhood of the 
Ashburton River at an elevation of 
2100 feet above sea level. They de- 
scribe the animal as being of a dark 
brown color, of the same size as a 
large rabbit. They hit it with a whip; 
it emitted a whistling sound and dis- 
appeared quickly in the water along 
the reeds.” 

That footnote was the sum to- 
tal that Dr. von Hochstetter (or 
rather Dr. von Haast) could re- 
port. Even at a later date, during 
the official Inaugural Address at 
the occasion of the founding of 
the Philosophical Institute of 
Canterbury, Sir Julius could not 
claim to have ever seen the ani- 
mal. But he repeated that he had 
seen its tracks many times. 

Meanwhile, the animal had 
made its appearance in another 
footnote. In 1855, a London pub- 
lishing house printed a book by 
the Reverend Richard Taylor, en- 
titled Te Ika A Maui, Or, New 
Zealand and its Inhabitants. The 




footnote on p. 394 reads in full: 



A man named Sevmour, of Otaki, 
stated that he had repeatedly seen 
an animal in the Middle Island, near 
Dusky Bay, on the south-west 
coast, which he called a musk-rat, 
from the strong smell it emitted. He 
said, its tail was thick, and resem- 
bled the ripe piiori, the fruit of the 
kie-kie, which is not unlike in ap- 
pearance to the tail of a beaver. 
This account was corroborated by 
Tamihana te Rauparaha, who spoke 

70 



of it as being more than double the 
size of the Norway rat, and as hav- 
ing a large flat tail. A man named 
Tom Crib, who had been engaged 
in whaling and sealing in the neigh- 
borhood of Dusky Bay for more 
than twenty-five years, said he had 
not himself seen the beaver, but had 
several times met with their habita- 
tions, and had been surprised by 
seeing little streams dammed up, 
and houses like bee-hives erected on 
one side, having two entrances, one 
from above and the other below the 
dam. One of the Camerons, who 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



lived at Kaiwarawara, when the set- 
tlers first came to Wellington, stated 
that he saw one of these large rats 
and pursued it, but it took to the 
water, and dived out of sight. 

^ I ■’ HE two comments which may 
have to be made to clear up 
a few question marks in the read- 
er’s mind are that for a while the 
South Island was called Middle 
Island (the one now called Stew- 
art Island was then named South 
Island), while the Norway rat 
mentioned is the common Euro- 
pean brown rat, which can be of 
considerable size itself. 

As time went on, reports about 
the Waitoreke became rarer and 
rarer. In other words there weren’t 
any, and books about New Zea- 
land or about natural history 
followed the style started by Fer- 
dinand von Hochstetter: the 

Waitoreke began to dwell exclu- 
sively in footnotes. 

But naturalists would have 
given almost anything to find out 
whether it lived in New Zealand 
lakes and rivers, too. For in the 
meantime, the facts of life, evolu- 
tion, had been realized and a New 
Zealand mammal held high prom- 
ises just because of its location. 

The earliest known mammals 
were the monotremes, platypus 
and two types of echidna, known 
from Australia and New Guinea. 
They had survived there, along 
with hosts of mammals of the 
next higher type, the marsupials, 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



because their area had become 
separated from other land masses 
at a time when the marsupials 
were the highest mammals there 
were. 

Now there was every indication 
that the land connection to New 
Zealand (via New Guinea) had 
broken down at an even earlier 
time. If there was an indigenous 
New Zealand mammal, it had to 
be very old and probably was a 
monotromelike platypus, sharing 
with it the habit of dwelling near 
water, but not necessarily looking 
like it. 

And since New Zealand had 
preserved a reptile, the Hatteria 
or Sphenodon, which was most 
decidedly “pre-dinosaur” in age, a 
New Zealand mammal might 
even have a bodily organization 
which could be called “pre-mam- 
mal.” In short, it might be the 
scientific find of the century — 
provided it could be found. 

The area where it might be 
found could be reasonably well 
localized. All reports, with a sin- 
gle doubtful exception, had come 
from the South Island, more spe- 
cifically the southern half of the 
South Island. 

Walter Mantell heard his story 
on the east coast of the South 
Island, to the south of Banks’ 
Peninsula. Sir Julius von Haast 
had seen the tracks in the interior 
fairly far to the south. And Lake 
Heron — it is just about 1 Vz miles 

71 



long and not entered on most 
maps — might be said to be just 
about the center of the South 
Island. 

Dusky Bay, of course, is almost 
at the southern end and I might 
add that Takahe was once taken 
near Dusky Bay and that the 
most recent (but more than a 
century old) report of a small 
moa also came from that area. 

S TRANGELY enough, the very 
first report — if it is one — also 
came from Dusky Bay. Again I 
have to quote a footnote, this 
time from p. 476 of Wallace’s Isl- 
and Life. 

The animal described by Captain 
Cook as having been seen at Pick- 
ersgill Harbour in Dusky Bay 
(Cook’s 2nd Voya^, Vol. I, p. 98) 
may have been the same creature. 
He says: “A four-footed animal was 
seen by three or four of our people, 
but as no two gave the same de- 
scription of it, I cannot say what 
kind it is. All, however, agreed that 
it was about the size of a cat, with 
short legs, and of a mouse color. 
One of the seamen, and he who had 
the best view of it, said it had a 
bushy tail, and was the most like a 
jackal of any animal he knew.” It is 
suggestive that, so far as the points 
in which “all agreed” — the size and 
the dark color — this description 
would answer well to the animal so 
recently seen [this is in reference 
to von Haast’s Lake Heron story] 
while the “short legs” correspond to 
the otter-like tracks, and the thick 
tail of an otter-like animal may well 
have appeared “bushy” when the 



fur was dry. It has been suggested 
that it was only one of the native 
dogs; but as none of those who saw 
it took it for a dog, and the points 
on which they all agreed are not 
dog-like, we can hardly accept this 
explanation. 

Sorry — this ends the story. The 
Waitoreke has not been found 
and the latest remark about it 
that I could find occurs in The 
New Zealand Nature Book by W. 
Martin, printed in Auckland, New 
Zealand, in 1930. It says there 
(for once not in a footnote), 
“Other than the two species of 
bats. New Zealand has no land 
mammals whatsoever, unless there 
be more truth than is generally 
believed in the persistent reports 
of a native otter.” 

MISSING INGREDIENT 

COME ten years ago, I worked 
as a research engineer for a 
company in the instrument busi- 
ness. The bread and butter of the 
firm was radio-sondes for the 
Weather Bureau, those little in- 
strument packages containing a 
kind of thermometer, a device for 
measuring air pressure and a 
third one for measuring humidity, 
all three being hitched up with a 
radio transmitter so that the read- 
ings taken by the instruments 
aloft can be received and re- 
corded on the ground. 

The company also published a 



72 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



weekly or biweekly company 
newspaper. One day, the lady in 
charge cornered me at lunch, 
wondering aloud — and in the 
presence of four witnesses — 
whether I might not be persuaded 
to write something for the com- 
pany paper. I said yes without 
having any idea what I might 
write for them, but talks with 
some of the assembly line inspec- 
tors and one or two junior engi- 
neers taught me that nobody in 
the whole plant and only one man 
in the laboratory (its director) 
had any idea of the history of the 
radio-sondes they were making 
busily every day. 

So I dug into both company 
records and meteorological litera- 
ture and came up with a three- 
part article of how the radio- 
sonde had come into being. And 
while I was busily noting down 
events and dates, I found, to my 
own surprise, that the radio-sondes 
they began making in 1929 or 
thereabouts could have been 
manufactured as far back as 1914. 
Not all the component parts 
which were actually used had 
been available in 1914, but other 
components, which could have 
done the same job, had been at 
hand. 

I am not trying to change the 
theme — quite the contrary — but 
I now have to mention that the 
first liquid-fuel rocket to lift itself 
off the ground did so in Massachu- 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



setts in 1926. And the first really 
large liquid-fuel rocket to work 
successfully was one of the early 
V-2 rockets; the date was October 
3rd, 1942. But when you look at 
a liquid-fuel rocket, you also find 
that most components (or mate- 
rials) had been around many 
years prior to those dates. It 
would actually have been possible 
to send a liquid-fuel rocket to an 
altitude of at least 30 miles half 
a century ago, in 1906. 

The diagram shows a simplified 
cross section through a large 
liquid-fuel rocket of the type of 
V-2 or Viking. Let us begin at the 
top and see what the parts are 
and how they work. 

The very nose of the rocket is 
conical, usually made of sheet 
steel, and it houses the instru- 
ments which constitute the “pay- 
load.” As for the sheet steel, it be- 
came available in 1880 and the 
same year may be held to apply 
for recording meteorological in- 
struments. Of course there would 
be no great difference if the skin 
were sheet iron instead of sheet 
steel and that is almost three cen- 
turies older. 

7^ ATURALLY, since the year 

’ we have in mind is 1906, 
these instruments could not have 
broadcast their findings; radio 
was in existence, but it had a long 
way to progress imtil it could be 
used for this purpose. However, it

would have been possible to eject 
the instrument package with the 
aid of a timing device and para- 
chute it to the ground. The first 
recorded use of a parachute took 
place in 1785, when Monsieur 
Blanchard dropped a dog from 
the gondola of his balloon. (He 
tried it on himself in 1793, but 
Leonardo da Vinci had sketched 
this about 1510.) Of course there 
were timing devices and “infernal 
machines” around at the same 
time. 

The next section below the nose 
cone holding the payload is usu- 
ally the section containing the 
rocket instruments. What we use 
now did not exist in 1906, but an 
engineer could have rigged up a 
gyro, driven, say, by compressed 
nitrogen. 

But if you just want a vertical 
or near-vertical flight, you do not 
need this section at all. That a 
liquid-fuel rocket can fimction 
without it and produce a fine ver- 
tical flight was once accidentally 
proved by an Aerobee rocket. The 
Aerobee has no “guidance,” rely- 
ing instead on what is called 
“arrow stability.” But imtil this 
unforeseen event took place, 
everybody would have agreed 
that the rocket needed the push 
from the solid-fuel booster to ac- 
quire enough arrow stability. 

Well, in this particular case, a 
valve misbehaved, the Aerobee 
began working, left its solid-fuel 



booster behind in the launching 
rack and climbed peacefully to 
nearly 20 miles. 

Next section in the rocket is 
the tank for the oxidizer. Big 
rockets like Viking and V-2 use 
liquid oxygen, available since 
1902. Smaller rockets like the 
Aerobee use nitric acid, available 
for centuries. 

The next tank is the fuel tank. 
Again the big rockets use 75 per 
cent ethyl alcohol, which Italian 
monks started distilling about 
1200. Or you may prefer hydra- 
zine, which sounds enormously 
“modern” but was made for the 
first time in 1887. The tanks 
themselves are, of course, sheet 
metal and though nitric acid is 
hard on metals, it would have 
been no real problem in 1906 to 
devise a tank which could have 
held nitric acid for an hour or so. 

B elow the fuel tanks, you 
have the rocket motor. It has 
a shape which simply did not ex- 
ist in 1906. But its shape is not so 
difficult that it could not have 
been made then. As for the mate- 
rial, you could use sheet steel or 
sheet copper or sheet aluminum, 
which became available in 1890. 
For the metal-forming techniques 
of 1906, sheet copper might have 
been the best bet, since there was 
not much practice yet in the 
handling and forming of alumi- 
num.

If that rocket had worked on 
hydrazine and nitric acid, there 
would have been no problem with 
ignition, for this is a so-called hy- 
pergolic combination which bursts 
into flame spontaneously when 
the two liquids touch each other. 
For an alcohol-oxygen rocket, ig- 
nition is required — and the de- 
vice used is a fireworks pinwheel 
inserted into the motor through 
the exhaust nozzle. A fireworks 
pinwheel could have been bought 
in Nuremberg in 1650. 

As for getting the fuels from 
the tanks into the rocket motor, 
the modern practice is to have 
high-strength hydrogen peroxide 
decompose into steam, which 
drives a turbine, which in turn 
drives the centrifugal pumps. Cen- 
trifugal pumps began to be built 
commercially in about 1875. 
High-strength hydrogen peroxide 
did not become available until 
much later, but an engineer might 
have rigged up a different method 
of driving the fuel pumps. Or 
else he might just have pressur- 
ized both the fuel and the oxidizer 
tank with compressed nitrogen. 

In short, all the materials, in- 
cluding the fuels, for a vertical 
rocket shot into the stratosphere 
were available in 1906. The few 
things which were not directly 
available were within easy reach 
of the engineering methods of the 
time. 

But, as we well know, nobody 



even tried to build a liquid-fuel 
rocket in 1906. The fuels and ma- 
terials were there. General engi- 
neering practice existed, too. So 
did the necessary mathematics to 
calculate whatever needed calcu- 
lating. But it wasn’t done. It 
couldn’t be done because nobody 
had said that it could be done. 

There was one ingredient miss- 
ing and it happens to be the most 
important one. There was no 
theory. 

ICEBERGS FOR 
LOS ANGELES 

C OMEBODY, somewhere, must 
^ have published the idea that 
Los Angeles might be supplied 
with drinking water by means of 
towing icebergs from Antarctica 
to Long Beach and allowing them 
to melt after they got there. Ice- 
bergs, being originally compacted 
snow, consist of fresh water; that 
much is certain. I don’t know 
whether Los Angeles is short of 
drinking water to the extent of 
considering such plans. In fact, I 
don’t even know how that pro- 
{K>sal reads in detail. 

All I know is that a reader 
asked me whether this idea is 
feasible at all or whether an ice- 
berg, towed such a distance 
through equatorial seas, would 
melt en route. This is a question 
to which one can attempt to find 
an answer. It so happens that 



76 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



there is some practical experience 
with the towing, not of icebergs, 
but of rather bulky objects. 

The objects were large log rafts 
which were towed along the Pa- 
cific shore of the United States 
from Seattle to San Diego. The 
log rafts were more than 1000 
feet long, with a width of around 
60 feet. Their weight amounted to 
15,000 tons and they had a draft 
comparable to a very large ocean 
liner, namely 28 feet. It took only 
one ocean-going tug with a 1000 
horse-power engine to tow them; 
of course, since they did not make 
much speed, they needed about 
two weeks for the 1400-mile trip. 

It is important to mention that 
the practical experience did not 
consist of just one such tow. If 
there had been only one, we 
might with much justification 
conclude that everybody hap- 
pened to be very lucky. But in 
the course of a few years, 118 
such rafts were assembled in Se- 
attle and only three of the 118 
failed to reach San Diego. Two 
of them came apart en route be- 
cause the chains which held them 
together broke in several places. 
The third one had to be aban- 
doned because it caught fire — 
don’t ask me how. 

The main lesson learned from 



all this was that large and bulky 
buoyant objects can be towed 
over long distances with compara- 
tively little engine power if a 
slow speed is acceptable. 

Now we can go back to the 
proposed towing of icebergs. If 
you travel along the 118th west- 
ern meridian, you would reach 
the shore of Antarctica at about 
a southern latitude of 70 degrees. 
No land, not even an island, 
would get in the way along that 
meridian. The distance that 
would have to be traveled is, in 
round figures, 9000 miles. If you 
assume a towing speed of 5 mph, 
you’d cover a distance of 120 
miles in 24 hours. The time 
needed to get the iceberg from 
Antarctica to Long Beach, Cali- 
fornia, would therefore be 75 
days. 

It is well known that a large 
mass of solid ice is rather resist- 
ant to melting, but whether an 
iceberg would last for approxi- 
mately 45 days being towed 
through warm seas is something 
that can really be decided only 
by experiment. And what you do 
with the iceberg after you get it 
where you want it is another little 
problem I don’t care to tackle at 
the moment.

Pete tossed the letter down the

a bet to himself because it had 
come three days later than he 
expected, but it had come all 
the same, just as it alwa3rs did 
when Tommy got himself into a 
hole. 

Not that he didn’t like Tommy. 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Tommy was a good PR-man, as 
PR-men go. He just didn’t know 
his own depth. PRoblem in a 
beady Grdznth eye! What Tom- 
my needed just now was a Ba- 
zooka Battalion, not a Public Re- 
lations man. Pete settled back 
resignedly in the Eastbound 
Rocketjet and paid off the bet 
to himself one drink at a time. 

He had four gone and a fifth 
going when the fat lady up the 
aisle let out a scream. A huge 
saurian head had materialized 
out of nowhere and was hanging 
in air, peering about uncertainly. 
A scaly green body followed, four 
feet away, complete with long 
razor talons, heavy hind legs, 
and a whiplash tail with a needle 
at the end. 

It floated upside down for a 
moment, legs thrashing. Then the 
head and body joined, executed 
a horizontal pirouette, and set- 
tled gently to the floor like an 
eight-foot circus balloon. 

^|'’WO rows down, a small boy 
let out a muffled howl and 
tried to bury himself in his moth- 
er’s coat collar. An indignant wail 
arose from the fat lady. Someone 
behind Pete groaned aloud and 
quickly retired behind a news- 
paper. 

The creature coughed apolo- 
getically. “Terribly sorry,” he said 
in a coarse rumble. “So difficult 
to control, you know. Terribly 



sorry ...” His voice trailed off 
as he lumbered down the aisle 
toward the empty seat next to 
Pete. 

The fat lady gasped and an 
angry murmur ran through the 
cabin. “Sit down,” Pete said to 
the creature. “Relax. Cheerful re- 
ception these days, eh?” 

“You don’t mind?” asked the 
creature, monstrously agape in 
surprise. 

“Not at all.” Pete put his brief- 
case on the floor. 

At a distance, the huge beast 
had looked like a nightmare com- 
bination of large alligator and 
small tyrannosaurus. Now, close 
up, Peter could see that the 
“scales” were actually tiny wrin- 
kles of satiny green fur. He knew, 
of course, that the Grdznth were 
mammals — “docile, f>eace-loving 
mammals,” Tommy’s PR-blasts 
had declared emphatically — but 
with one of them sitting about a 
foot away, Pete had to fight down 
a wave of horror and revulsion. 

The creature was most incred- 
ibly ugly. Great yellow pouches 
hung down below flat reptilian 
eyes and a double row of long 
curved teeth glittered sharply. 
The creature was rolling its eyes 
wildly and puffing like a fat man 
on a steep hill. 

“Misgauged?” said Pete, grip- 
ping the seat in spite of himself. 

The Grdznth nodded sadly. 
“It’s horrible of me,” he panted.

“I just can’t help it, I always mis-

cel of St. John’s Cathedral. I 
nearly stampeded Morning 
Prayer — ” He paused to catch 
his breath. “What an effort. The 
energy barrier, you know. Fright- 
fully hard to make the jump — ” 
He broke off sharply, staring out 
the port. “Are we going east?” 
“I’m afraid so, friend.” 

“Oh, dear. I wanted to get to 
Florida.” 

“Well, you seem to have drifted 
through into the wrong airplane,” 
said Pete. “Why Florida?” 

The Grdznth looked at him re- 
proachfully. “The Wives, of 
course. The climate is so much 
better and they musn’t be dis- 
turbed, you know.” 

“Of course,” said Pete. “In 
their condition. I’d forgotten.” 
“And then I’m told that things 
have been somewhat — unpleas- 
ant — in the East just now.” 

TJETE thought of Tommy, red- 
faced and frantic, beating off 
the hordes of indignant citizens. 
“So I hear,” he said. “How many 
more of you are coming through?” 
“Oh, not many, not many at 
all. Only the Wives — half a mil- 
lion or so — and their spouses, of 
course.” The creature clicked his 
talons nervously. “We haven’t 
much more time, you know. Only 
a few more weeks, a few months 
at the most. If we couldn’t have 



stopped over here, I just don’t 
know what we’d have done.” 

“Think nothing of it,” said Pete 
indulgently. “It’s been great hav- 
ing you.” 

The passengers within earshot 
stiffened, glaring at Pete. The fat 
lady was whispering indignantly 
to her seat companion. Junior 
had half emerged from the collar; 
he was busy sticking his tongue 
out at the Grdznth. 

The creature shifted uneasily. 
“Really, I think — perhaps Florida 
would be better.” 

“Going to try it again right 
now? Don’t rush off,” said Pete. 

“Oh, I don’t mean to rush. It’s 
been lovely, but — ” Already the 
Grdznth was beginning to fade 
out. 

“Try four miles down and a 
thousand miles southeast,” said 
Pete. 

The creature gave him a toothy 
smile, nodded once, and grew 
more indistinct. In another five 
seconds, the seat was empty. Pete 
leaned back, grinning to himself 
as the angry rumble rose around 
him like a wave. He was a Public 
Relations man to the core, but 
right now he was off duty. He 
poured another drink and chuck- 
led all the way to New Philly. 
The passengers avoided him 
pointedly. 

But as he walked down the 
gangway to hail a cab, he wasn’t 
smiling so much. He was wonder-

ing just how high Tommy was 
hanging him this time. 

' I ■'HE lobby of the Public Rela- 
tions Bureau was swarming 
like an upturned anthill when 
Pete disembarked from the taxi. 
He could almost smell the des- 
perate tension of the place. He 
fought his way past scurrying 
clerks and preoccupied poll-takers 
toward the executive elevators. 

On the newly finished seven- 
teenth floor, Tommy Heinz was 
pacing the corridor like a father 
in labor. Tommy had lost weight 
since Pete had last seen him. His 
ruddy face was paler, his hair 
thin and ragged, as though chunks 
had been torn out from time to 
time. He saw Pete step off the 
elevator, and ran forward with 
open arms. 

“Thank God you came!” he 
groaned. “I thought you’d never 
call. I was afraid you’d let me 
down — ” 

“Me?” said Pete. “I’d never 
let down a pal.” 

The sarcasm didn’t dent Tom- 
my. He led Pete through the ante- 
room into the plush director’s 
office, thrusting a drink into his 
hand and bouncing about like a 
nervous sparrow. His words were 
tumbling out like a waterfall. He 
looked as though one gentle shove 
might send him yodeling down 
Market Street in his underdraw- 
ers.

“Hold it,” said Pete. “Relax. I'm 
not going to leave for a while 
yet. Your girl screamed something 
about a Senator as we passed 
through. Did you hear her?” 
Tommy gave a violent start. 
“Senator!” He flipped a desk 
switch. “What Senator is that?” 
“Senator Stokes,” the girl said 
wearily. “He had an appointment. 
He’s ready to have you fired.” 
“All I need now is a Senator. 
What does he want?” 

“Guess,” said the girl. 

“Oh. That’s what I was afraid 
of. Can you hold him?” 

“They swept around him last 
night and dusted him off this 
morning. His appointment was 
for yesterday, remember?” 

“Remember! Of course I re- 
member. Senator Stokes — some- 
thing about a riot in Boston.” 
Tommy started to flip the switch, 
then added, “See if you can get 
Charlie down here with his giz.” 

IJE turned back to Pete with 
a frantic light in his eye. 
“Good old Pete. Just in time. 
Eleventh-hour reprieve. Have an- 
other drink, have a cigar — do you 
want my job? It’s yours. Just 
speak up.” 

“I fail to see,” said Pete, “why 
you had to drag me all the way 
from L. A. to have a cigar. I’ve 
got work to do.” 

“Selling movies, right?” 
“Check.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“To people who don’t want to 
buy them, right?” 

“In a manner of speaking,” 
said Pete testily. 

“Considering some of the mov- 
ies you’ve been selling, you should 
be able to sell anything to any- 
body, any time, at any price.” 
“Please. Movies Are Getting 
Better by the Day.” 

“Yes, I know. And the Grdznth 
are getting worse by the hour. 
They’re coming through in bat- 
talions — a thousand a day! The 
more Grdznth come through, the 
more they act as though they 
own the place. Not nasty or any- 
thing — it’s that infernal polite- 
ness that the people hate most, 
I think. Can’t get them mad, can’t 
get them into a fight — but they 
do just as they please, and go 
anywhere they please, and if the 
people don’t like it, the Grdznth’ 
go right ahead anyway.” 

Pete pulled at his lip. “Any 
violence?” 

Tommy gave him a long look. 
“So far, we’ve kept it out of the 
papers, but there have been some 
incidents. Didn’t hurt the Grd- 
znth a bit — they’re ultra-paci- 
fists, but they carry personal pro- 
tective fields around with them, 
activated, a little point they didn’t 
bother to tell us about. Anybody 
who tries anything fancy gets 
thrown like a bolt of lighting 
hit him. Rumors are getting wild 
— people are saying they can’t 



be killed, that they’re just mov- 
ing in to stay.” 

Pete nodded slowly. “Are 
they?” 

“I wish I knew. I mean for 
sure. The psych-docs say no — 
the Grdznth agreed to leave at a 
specified time, they say, and some- 
thing in their cultural background 
makes them stick strictly to their 
agreements. But that’s just what 
the psych-docs think and they’ve 
been known to be wrong.” 

“And the app)ointed time?” 

^ I ■’OMMY spread his hands 
helplessly. “If we knew, you’d 
still be in L. A. Roughly six 
months and four days — plus or 
minus a month or so for the time 
differential. That’s strictly ten- 
tative, according to the math 
boys. It’s a parallel universe, one 
of several thousand already ex- 
plored, according to the Grdznth 
scientists working with Charlie 
Karns. Most of the parallels are 
analogous and we just happen to 
be anthropologically analogous to 
the Grdznth, a point we’ve omit- 
ted from our PR-blasts. They 
have an eight-planet system 
around a hot sun which is going 
to get lots hotter any day now. 

Pete’s eyes widened. “Nova?” 

“Apparently. Nobody knows 
how they predicted it, but they 
did. Spotted it several years ago, 
so they’ve been romping through

find one they can migrate to. 
They found one, sort of a desper- 
ation choice. It’s cold and arid 
and full of impassable mountain 
chains. With an uphill fight, they 
can make it support a fraction of 
their population.” 

Tommy shook his head help- 
lessly. “They picked a very sen- 
sible system for getting a good 
strong Grdznth population on the 
new parallel as fast as possible. 
Picked the males for brains, ed- 
ucation and adaptability. The fe- 
males were largely chosen ac- 
cording to how pregnant they 
were.” 

Pete grinned. “Grdznth in ut- 
ero. There’s something poetic 
about it.” 

“Just one hitch,” said Tommy, 
“The girls can’t gestate in that 
climate — at least not until they’ve 
been there long enough to get 
their glands adjusted. Seems we 
have just the right climate for 
gestating Grdznth, even better 
than at home. So they came beg- 
ging for permission to stop here, 
on the way through, to rest and 
parturate.” 

“So Earth becomes a glorified 
incubator.” Pete got to his feet 
and refilled his glass thought- 
fully from the bar at the end of 
the room. “This is all very touch- 
ing, but it just doesn’t wash. If 
the Grdznth are so unpopular 
here, why did we let them in in 
the first place?” He looked nar- 

S4 



rowly at Tommy. “To be very 
blunt — what’s the parking fee?” 

“Plenty,” said Tommy heavily. 
“That’s the trouble. The fee is 
so high. Earth just can’t afford to 
lose it. Charlie Karns’ll tell you 
why.” 

^HARLIE KARNS from Math 
'-^Section was an intense skele- 
ton of a man with a long pointed 
jaw and a long white coat droop- 
ed over his shoulders like a 
shroud. In his arms, he clutched 
a small black box. 

“It’s this parallel universe bus- 
iness, of course,” he explained 
to Pete, with Tommy beaming 
over his shoulder. “The Grdznth 
can cross through. They’ve been 
able to do it for a long time. Ac- 
cording to our figuring, this must 
involve complete control of mass, 
space and dimension, all three. 
And time comes into one of the 
three — we aren’t sure which.” 

The mathematician set the 
black box on the desk and re- 
leased the lid. Like a jack-in-the- 
box, two small white plastic 
spheres popped out and began 
chasing each other about in the 
air six inches above the box. 
Presently a third sphere rose up 
from the box and joined in the 
fun. 

Pete watched it until his head 
began to spin. “No wires?” 

“Strictly no wires,” said Charlie 
glumly. “No nothing.” He closed 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the box with a click. “This is 
one of their children’s toys. 
Among other things, it takes null- 
gravity to work.” 

Pete sat down, rubbing his chin. 
“I’m beginning to see. They’re 
teaching you this?” 

Tommy said, “They’re trying 
to. He’s been working for weeks 
with their top mathematicians — 
him and a dozen others. How 
many computers have you burned 
out, Charlie?” 

“Four. There’s a differential 
factor and we can’t spot it. They 
have the equations, all right. It’s 
a matter of translating them into 
constants that make sense. But 
we haven’t yet cracked the dif- 
ferential.” 

“And if you do, then what?” 
Charlie took a deep breath. 
“We’ll have interdimensional con- 
trol — a practical, utilizable trans- 
matter. We’ll have null-gravity — 
which means the greatest advance 
in power utilization since fire was 
discovered. It might give us the 
opening to a concept of time tra- 
vel that makes some kind of 
sense. And power! If there’s an 
energy differential of any mag- 
nitutude — ” He shook his head 
sadly. “ ‘Then what?’ the man 
says.” 

“We’ll also know the time dif- 
ferential,” Tommy cut in hope- 
fully, “and how long the Grdznth 
gestation period will be.” 

“It’s a fair exchange,” said 



Charlie. “We keep them until the 
girls have their babies. They teach 
us the ABCs of space, mass and 
dimension.” 

Pete nodded. “That is, if you 
can make the people put up with 
them for another six months or 
so.” 

Tommy sank back in his chair. 
“In a word — yes. So far, we’ve 
gotten nowhere at a thousand 
miles an hour.” 

??¥ CAN’T do it!” the cosme- 

-*■ tician wailed, hurling him- 
self down on a chair and burying 
his face in his hands. “I’ve failed. 
Failed!” 

The Grdznth sitting on the 
stool looked regretfully from the 
cosmetician to the Public Rela- 
tions men. “I say — I am sorry 
...” His coarse voice trailed off 
as he peeled a long strip of cake 
makeup off his satiny green face. 

Pete Greenwood stared at the 
sobbing cosmetician. “What’s eat- 
ing him?” 

“Professional pride,” said Tom- 
my. “He can take twenty years 
off the face of any woman in Hol- 
lywood, but he can’t get to first 
base with Gorgeous over there. 
This is only one thing we’ve 
tried,” he added as they moved 
on down the corridor. “You 
should see the field reports. We’ve 
tried selling the advances Earth 
will have, the wealth, the power. 
No dice. The man in the street

reads our PR-blast and then looks 
up to see one of the nasty things 
staring over his shoulders at the 
newspaper.” 

“So you can’t make them beau- 
tiful,” said Pete. “Can’t you make 
them cute?” 

“With those teeth? Those eyes? 
Ugh.” 

“How about the ‘jolly company’ 
approach?” 

“Tried it. There’s nothing jol- 
ly about them. They pop out of 
nowhere, anywhere. In church, in 
bedrooms, in rush-hour traffic 
through Lincoln Tunnel — look!” 

Pete peered out the window at 
the traffic jam below. Cars were 
snarled for blocks on either side 
of the intersection. A squad of 
traffic cops was converging an- 
grily on the center of the mess, 
where a stream of green reptil- 
ian figures seemed to be popping 
out of the street and lumbering 
through the jammed autos like 
General Sherman tanks. 

“Ulcers,” said Tommy. “City 
traffic isn’t enough of a mess as it 
is. And they don’t do anything 
about it. They apologize profuse- 
ly, but they keep coming through.” 
The two started on for the office. 
“Things are getting to the break- 
ing point. The people are wearing 
thin from sheer annoyance — to 
say nothing of the nightmares the 
kids are having and the trouble 
with women fainting.” 

The signal light on Tommy’s 



desk was flashing scarlet. He 
dropped into a chair with a sigh 
and flipped a switch. “Okay, what 
is it now?” 

“Just another Senator,” said a 
furious male voice. “Mr. Heinz, 
my arthritis is beginning to win 
this fight. Are you going to see 
me now or aren’t you?” 

“Yes, yes, come right in!” Tom- 
my turned white. “Senator 
Stokes. I’d completely forgot- 
ten — ” 

TPHE SENATOR didn’t seem 
to like being forgotten. He 
walked into the office, looked dis- 
dainfully at the PR-men and sat 
on the edge of a chair, leaning on 
his umbrella. 

“You have just lost your job,” 
he said with an icy edge to his 
voice. “You may not have heard 
about it yet, but you may take my 
word for it. I personally will be 
delighted to make the necessary 
arrangements, but I doubt if I’ll 
need to. There are at least a hun- 
dred Senators in Washington who 
are ready to press for your dis- 
missal, Mr. Heinz — and there’s 
been some off-the-record talk 
about a lynching. Nothing official, 
of course.” 

“Senator — ” 

“Senator be damned. We want 
somebody in this office who can 
manage to do something." 

“Do something! You think I’m 
a magician? I can just make them 



86

vanish? What do you want me 
to do?” 

The Senator raised his eye- 
brows. “You needn’t shout, Mr. 
Heinz. I am not the least inter- 
ested in what you do. My inter- 
est is focused completely on a 
collection of five thousand letters, 
telegrams and visiphone calls I’ve 
received in the past three days 
alone. My constituents, Mr. 
Heinz, are making themselves 
clear. If the Grdznth do not go, 
I go.” 

“That would never do, of 
course,” said Pete. 

The Senator gave Pete a cold, 
clinical look. Then he asked Tom- 
my, “Who is this person?” 

“An assistant on the job,” Tom- 
my said quickly. “A very excel- 
lent PR-man.” 

The Senator sniffed audibly. 
“Full of ideas, no doubt.” 

“Brimming,” said Pete. 
“Enough ideas to get your con- 
stituents off your neck for a while, 
at least.” 

“Indeed?” A warmer look came 
into the Senator’s eyes. Tommy 
swallowed hard and tried to get 
his cigar lighted. 

“Indeed,” said Pete. “Tommy, 
how fast can you get a PR-blast 
to penetrate? How much medium 
do you control?” 

“Plenty,” Tommy gulped. 

“And how fast can you sample 
response and analyze it?” 

“We can have prelims six hours 



after the PR-blast is launched. 
For God’s sake, man, if you have 
something, tell us! Don’t keep 
us sweating!” 

13ETE STOOD up), facing the 
Senator. “Everything else has 
been tried, but it seems to me 
one important factor has been 
missed, one that will take your 
constituents by the ears.” He 
looked at Tommy pityingly. 
“You’ve tried to make them beau- 
tiful, but they aren’t beautiful. 
And you’ve tried to make them 
lovable, but they aren’t lovable. 
There’s one thing they are, though 
— at least half of them.” 

Tommy’s jaw sagged. “Preg- 
nant,” he said. 

“Now see here,” spluttered the 
Senator. “If you're trying to make 
a fool of me to my face — ” 

“Sit down and shut up,” said 
Pete. “If there’s one thing every 
human being reveres, my friend, 
it’s motherhood. We’ve got sev- 
eral hundred thousand pregant 
Grdznth just waiting for all the 
little Grdznth to arrive — and no- 
body’s given them a side glance.” 
He turned to Tommy. “Get some 
copywriters down here and a Grd- 
znth obstetrician or two. We’re 
going to put together a PR-blast 
that will twang the people’s heart- 
strings like a billion harps.” 

The color was back in Tom- 
my’s cheeks and the Senator was 
forgotten as a dozen intercom

switches began snapping. “We’ll 
need TV hookups and plenty of 
newscast space,” Tommy said 
eagerly. “Maybe a few photo- 
graphs — do you suppose baby 
Grdznth are lovable?” 

“They probably look like sal- 
amaders,” said Pete. “But say 
anything you want. We’re going 
to get across the sanctity of Grd- 
znth motherhood, my friend, and 
anything goes.” 

“It’s genius,” chortled Tommy. 
“Sheer genius.” 

“If it sells,” the Senator added 
dubiously. 

“It’ll sell,” Pete said. “The 
question is: for how long?” 

npHE PLANNING was pure 
precision. Nothing sudden, 
harsh, or crude — but slowly, in 
a broadcast comment here or a 
newspaper story there, the em- 
phasis began to shift from Grd- 
znth in general to Grdznth as 
mothers. A Rutgers professor 
found his TV discussion on 
“Motherhood As An Experience” 
suddenly shifted from 6:30 Mon- 
day evening to 10:30 Saturday 
night. Copy rolled by the ream 
from Tommy’s office, refined 
copy, hypersensitively edited 
copy, finding its way into the 
light of day through devious 
channels. 

Three days later, a Grdznth 
miscarriage threatened and was 
averted. It was only a page four 

88 



item, but it was a beginning. 

Determined movements to ex- 
pel the Grdznth faltered, .trem- 
bled with indecision. The Grd- 
znth were ugly, they frightened 
little children, they were a trifle 
overbearing in their insufferably 
stubborn politeness — but in a ci- 
vilized world, you just couldn’t 
turn pregnant girls out in the 
rain. 

Not even Grdznth girls. 

By the second week, the blast 
was going at full tilt. 

In the Public Relations Buieau 
building, machines worked on in- 
to the night. As questionnaires 
came back, spot candid films 
and street-corner interview tapes 
ran through the projectors on a 
twenty-four-hour schedule. Tom- 
my Heinz grew thinner and thin- 
ner, while Pete nursed sharp post- 
prandial stomach pains. 

“Don’t start thinking,” he 
warned on the morning the third 
week started. “If we start think- 
ing now, we’re lost. Just react, 
feed the stuff into the ma- 
chines — ” 

“But why don’t the people re- 
spond?” Tommy plaintively ask- 
ed. “Haven’t they got any feel- 
ings? The blast is washing over 
them like a wave and there they 
sit!” He punched the private wire 
to Analysis for the fourth time 
that morning. He got a man with 
a hag-ridden look in his eye. “How 
soon?” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“You want yesterday’s rushes?” 

“What do you think I want? 
Any sign of a lag?” 

“No lag yet. Last night’s panel 
drew like a magnet. The ‘D-Date’ 
tag you suggested has them by 
the nose.” 

“How about the President’s 
talk?” 

“He should be campaigning.” 

Tommy mopped his forehead 
with his shirtsleeve. “Okay. Now 
listen: we need a special run on 
all the response data we have to 
date for tolerance levels. Got 
that? How soon can we have it?” 

Analysis shook his head. “We 
could only make a guess with the 
data to date.” 

“Fine,” said Tommy. “Make a 
guess.” 

“Give us three hours,” said 
Analysis. 

“Y ou’ve got thirty minutes. Get 
going.” 

S WIVELING BACK to Pete, 
Tommy rubbed his hands ea- 
gerly. “It’s starting to sell, boy. 
I don’t know how strong or how 
good, but it’s starting to sell! 
With the tolerance levels to tell 
us how long we can expect this 
program to quiet things down, 
we can give Charlie a deadline 
to crack his differential factor, 
or it’s the axe for Charlie.” 

Pete grunted and sank down 
behind the desk thoughtfully. 
Tommy chuckled to himself and 



paced the room in an overflow 
of nervous energy. “And what do 
we get? A revolutionized world! 
Open shafts instead of elevators. 
A quick hop to Honolulu for an 
afternoon on the beach and back 
in time for supper. A hundred 
miles to the gallon for the Sunday 
driver. Why, when people begin 
seeing what the Grdznth are giv- 
ing us, they’ll welcome them with 
open arms.” 

“Hmmmm,” said Pete. 

“Well, why won’t they? The 
people just didn’t trust us, that 
was all. What does the man in 
the street know about transmat- 
ters? Nothing. But give him one 
and then try to take it away — ” 
“Yeah, yeah,” interrupted Pete. 
“It sounds great. It also stinks.” 
Tommy blinked at him. “You 
crazy? What stinks?” 

Pete jammed his hands into 
his pockets. “This whole setup. 
Do you realize where we’re stand- 
ing in this thing? We’re but on a 
limb — way out. We’re fighting for 
time — time for Charlie and his 
gang to crack their puzzle, time 
for the Grdznth girls to gestate. 
But what are we hearing from 
Charlie?” 

“Well, it’s — it’s a difficult prob- 
lem. Charlie can’t just — ” 

“That’s right,” said Pete. “Noth- 
ing is what we’re hearing from 
Charlie. We’ve got no transmat- 
ter, no null-G, no power, nothing 
except a whole lot of Grdznth

89 



and more coming through just as 
fast as they can. I’m just begin- 
ning to wonder what the Grdznth 
are giving us." 

“Well, they can’t gestate for- 
ever ’’ 

“Maybe not, but I’ve still got 
a burning urge to talk to Charlie. 
I have a feeling they’re going to 
be gestating a little too long.” 

'T’HEY PUT through the call 
to math, but Charlie wasn’t 
answering. “Sorry,” the operator 
said. “Nobody’s gotten through 
there for three days.” 

Three days?” cried Tommy. 
“What’s wrong? Is he dead? - 
“Couldn’t be. They burned out 
two more machines last night. 
Killed the switchboard power for 
twenty minutes.” 

“Get him on the wire,” said 
Tommy. “That’s orders.” 

The operator sighed unhappily. 
“Yes, sir. But they want you in 
Analysis.” 

Analysis was a shambles. Pa- 
per and tape were piled knee- 
deep on the floor. The machines 
clattered wildly, coughing out 
reams of paper to be gulped by 
other machines. In a corner of- 
fice, they found their man, pale 
but jubilant. 

“The program,” said Tommy. 
“How’s it going?” 

“You can count on the people 
staying happy for at least anoth- 
er five months.” He hesitated an 



instant. “If they see some baby 
Grdznth at the end of it all.” 

There was dead silence in the 
room. “Baby Grdznth,” Tommy 
said finally. “And if it happens 
to be six months?” 

Analysis drew a finger across 
his throat. 

“What are we going to do?” 
Tommy’s hands were shaking. 

“We’re going to go find him,” 
Pete declared. 

IVTATH SECTION was like a 
-‘-"^tomb. The machines were si- 
lent. In the office at the end of 
the room, they found an unsha- 
ven Charlie grimly splitting a 
bottle with a very smug-looking 
Grdznth. The bottle was float- 
ing gently about six feet above 
the desk. So were the Grdznth 
and Charlie. 

“Charlie!” Tommy howled. 
“We’ve been trying to get you 
for hours. The operator — ” 

“I know, I know.” Charlie wav- 
ed a hand disjointedly. “I told 
her to go away. I told the rest 
of the crew to go away. Every- 
body.” 

“Then you cracked the differ- 
ential?” 

Charlie tipped an imaginary 
hat toward the Grdznth. “Spike 
cracked it. Spike is a sort of 
Grdznth Fermi.” He tilted the 
bottle up and rolled his head 
under it. “Now why don’t you go 
away, too?”

Tommy turned purple. “We’ve 
got five months,” he said hoarsely. 
“Do you hear me? If they aren’t 
going to have their babies in five 
months, we’re dead men.” 
Charlie chuckled. “Five months, 
he says. We figured the babies to 
come in about three months — 
right. Spike? Not that it’ll make 
much difference to us.” Charlie 
sank slowly down to the desk. 
He wasn’t laughing any more. 
“We’re never going to see any 
Grdznth babies. It’s going to be 
a little too cold for that.” 

Pete stared at the math man. 
“What else did you find?” 

“The energy factor,” Charlie 
mumbled. “Nobody thought of 
that, except in passing. Should 
have, though, long ago. Two com- 
pletely independent universes, 
obviously two energy systems. In- 
compatible. We were dealing with 
mass, space and dimension — but 
the energy differential was the 
important one.” 

“What about the energy?” 
“We’re loaded with it. Super- 
charged. Packed to the breaking 
point and way beyond.” Charlie 
scribbled frantically on the desk 



pad. “Look, it took energy for 
them to come through — immense 
quantities of energy. Every one 
that came through upset the bal- 
ance, distorted our whole energy 
pattern. And they knew from the 
start that the differential was all 
on their side — a million of them 
unbalances four billion of us. All 
they needed to overload us com- 
pletely was time for enough 
crossings.” 

“And we gave it to them.” Pete 
sat down slowly, his face green. 
“Like a rubber ball with a dent 
in the side. Push in one side, the 
other side pops out. And we’re 
the other side. When?” 

“Any day now. Maybe any 
minute.” Charlie spread his hands 
helplessly. “Oh, it won’t be bad 
at all. Spike here was telling me. 
Mean temperature is only 39 be- 
low zero, lots of good clean snow, 
thousands of nice jagged moun- 
tain peaks. A lovely place, really. 
Just a little too cold for Grdznth. 
They thought Earth was much 
nicer.” 

“For them,” whispered Tommy. 

“For them,” Charlie said.

S3.00 

¥F YOU like to curl up with a 
good mystery, take a good 
look at the people around you — 
you might not be able to uncurl! 
Robinson has come up with a new 
slant on homo superior. He is not 
the social-conscious “Baldy” of 
Padgett-Kuttner or the maso- 
chistic Odd John of Stapledon. 
Who says he must stick out like 
a sore thumb? Robinson, whose 
skill in yarn-spinning grows in 
leaps, envisages superman as a 

52 



master of camouflage, all things 
to all men — and all women, too. 
Neither is he a social being, but 
rather quite a bit of a monster, 
a cruel one at that. 

Professor Wm. Tanner, anthro- 
pologist and chairman of a Navy- 
subsidized committee testing hu- 
man endurance, has himself a 
problem to solve. Someone on his 
committee of nine is superman. 
Unfortunately, all too soon his 
committee at the mid-Western 
university is reduced to eight and 
he is reduced to hiding, because 
homo supe has destroyed the sole 
member who could expose his

pointing to Tanner. From that 
point on, Tanner becomes the de- 
fenseless rabbit in a harrowing 
chase that will have you biting

ICHARDS poses an ingenious 
situation. Two divisions of 
Russian infantry, parts of a Spe- 
cial Corps, take over Manhattan 
Island from Canal Street south. 
They have sneaked into the Nar- 
rows, past Quarantine, in Ameri- 
can lend-lease Liberty ships and 
tied up without challenge. With 
hardly a shot being fired, they 
have managed to subdue the 
sleepy populace before the Sun is 
fully up. 

But what have they to gain by 
putting their heads into the 
American eagle’s beak? 

Tcue, they have seized thou- 
sands of hostages as well as the 
financial capital. Wall Street, but 
they are in effect hostages them- 
selves. Moscow has disowned the 
Corps, but of course they would 
have in any event, since they 
have committed an act of war. 



Washington is set to eject the in- 
vaders, but pressure of opinion 
stops the Pentagon’s hand be- 
cause it just might be true that 
the Special Corps has pulled a 
beaut of a doublecross on the 
Kremlin. 

Sound like a solid foundation 
for an exciting invasion yarn with 
a brand-new slant? It is — only 
something happens to it about 
two-thirds through. Action turns 
to talk, talk to philosophy and 
philosophy to a conclusion that I 
just can’t see nohow.

THE GOLDEN KAZOO by John 
G. Schneider. Rinehart & Co., Inc. 
New York, $3.00 

S INCE this is an election year, 
Schneider’s book is of more 
than passing interest. It concerns 
itself with the 1960 election and 
the manner in which the admen 
have taken over by that time. 
Candidates are products to be 
sold and the campaigns are car- 
ried out on a strict merchandising 
level. Of course, Kornbluth and 
Pohl went considerably further in 
Gravy Planet, but Kazoo fills in 
some of the chinks. 

Blade Reade is the dynamic, 
ulcer-ridden advertising executive

INTERPLANETARY HUNTER 
by Arthur K. Barnes. Gnome 
Press, Inc., New York, $3.00 

U ndoubtedly, if you are 

an AX. like Barnes or me, 
this will take you back to the 
good(?) old days of the middle 
years of S-F, when the impact of 
Stanley Weinbaum’s Queeeell was 
still busily repercussing— the days 
of monsters and gimmicks. Of 
suchlike, the above volume has its 
fill and more. Add to that the 
lurid sketches by Ed Emsh and 
W. I. van der Poel and you have 
a fearful object indeed. 

In the heyday of Gerry Car- 
lyle, the fabulously gorgeous in- 
terplanetary hunter modeled with 
alterations after the glamor figure 
of the ’30s, Frank Buck, this was 
sizzling stuff. But, having seen 
other sizzling stuff turn stone-cold 
dead in the book market, I natu- 
rally approached this volume, 
some fifteen years later, with con- 
siderable trepidation. Astonish- 
ingly, these stories are still sur- 
prisingly readable. 

If you like a huge collection of 
assorted BEMs and well-thought- 
out gimmicks in tight situations, 
you will assuredly go for this. 



PLAGUE SHIP by Andrew 
North. Gnome Press, New York, 
$2.75 

¥¥ ERE is a “further adventure” 
of Dane Thorson and the 
Free Trader, the Solar Queen. If 
you recall Sargasso of Space, 
Thorson was assigned to a free- 
trade ship on graduation from 
training academy, instead of to a 
cushy job with one of the big 
companies. He doesn’t regret it, 
fortunately for teen-age readers, 
because he has himself a fistful of 
adventures such as he’d never 
have had as a cloistered company 
man. 

This time, the cargo-master of 
the Queen and his apprentice, 
Thorson, have a problem in estab- 
lishing trade relations with a 
feline race on Sargol, a planet to 
which they have won trading 
rights. Thorson solves the prob- 
lem, but in a manner that brings 
discredit on himself in spite of its 
success. 

On the home trip, an unknown 
illness knocks out all the crew 
except the apprentice youngsters 
who participated in a native cere- 
mony and somehow acquired im- 
munity. As a plague ship, the 
Queen is subject to outright de- 
struction or condemned to wan- 
der. Thorson solves that problem 
also, in an interesting fashion, but 
again with repercussions.

George 
All The Way 

By RICHARD WILSON 

It was very embarrassing . 

Marcer discovered that time 
travel was pure 23 skiddoo! 



E ven before the shimmer- 
ing stopp>ed, Bill Marcer 
saw that he was being 
surrounded. He felt a trifle un- 
easy, though the phlutters had 
assured him there would be no 
danger. 

Abruptly the shimmering was 
gone and Marcer seemed to feel 
the last of his personal molecules 



slip back into place as the Phleger 
effect faded. He wriggled his 
shoulders, threw them back, filled 
his chest and forced a smile. 

“Greetings,” he said to the 
crowd, pivoting to address as 
many as possible from the railed 
platform. “I, Billings Marcer, 
bring you greetings from the 
twentieth century.” No one had

told him to make a speech, but 
he thought it would be appro- 
priate. 

One of the men of the future 
stepped for)vard, smiling formally. 
He was dressed in pantaloons and 
a skirt, or kilt, and halter top, 
something like a Macedonian 
dancer, or maybe a Scot. 

“Hi,” this individual said, s{)eak- 
ing slowly and distinctly, as if to 
a foreigner. “Welcome to twenty- 
one seventy-seven. I’m Jeems 
Kenth to be your guide. Or would 
you prefer to make your double 
o solo?” 

“Double o solo?” Bill Marcer 
repeated. “You mean go around 
by myself?” 

“Oskie-wow-wow,” another pan- 
talooned man said. “You win the 
sixty-four thousands.” He pro- 
nounced each syllable with care. 

“What?” 

“You did say twentieth cen- 
tury?” the first futureman, Jeems 
Kenth, asked. He looked anxious. 

“Yes.” 

“Then everything’s jake,” he 
said with a visible return of his 
assurance. “We’ve straightened up 
and are flying right. Ish-kabibble?” 

“On the beam,” his fellow fu- 
tureman agreed. “Voot!” 

“The latter part of the twenti- 
eth century,” Marcer said. 

TT dawned on him that these 
-*■ people, in preparation for his 
visit, had been studying the folk 

GEORGE All THE WAY 



expressions of his time, or what 
they thought was his time. 

“The latter part?” Jeems Kenth 
looked disappointed. “Then we 
have not mastered your lan- 
guage? We are off the beam and 
icing up?” 

“Not at all,” Marcer said 
quickly. As unofficial ambassador 
from 1977, he had to be diplo- 
matic. “You’re right in the groove. 
Reet. Cooking on the front burner, 
with gas.” He wasn’t fluent in the 
embarrassing slang of his father’s 
and grandfather’s time, but he 
thought he could get by. “Shut 
my mouth,” he added as he 
thought of another one. 

“Fan my brow!” Kenth said 
delightedly. “The kid’s okay!” 

“Terrif!” added his friend, who 
identified himself as Aces Jack. 
“Slip us some skin.” 

“Natch,” said Marcer. He got 
down from the platform and 
shook hands all around, murmur- 
ing “Real George” or “Howza 
boy?” as he was introduced to 
Sperris Theo, Stanols Thom, Lu- 
cez Hank, Wobanx Joce and Jen- 
fooz Ed. 

“What say we tie on the feed- 
bag while we chew the rag?” sug- 
gested Jenfooz Ekl, who was heavy 
and hearty. “Something for the 
inner man?” 

“Fine,” said Bill Marcer. “That’d 
be the most, I mean.” 

He saw that he had material- 
ized in a public square and that 

97 



the crowd around him was hold- 
ing up traffic. Wildly colored 
three-wheeled vehicles waited 
calmly for the obstruction to 
clear, without a honk out of them. 
But now a uniformed man made 
his way through the crowd, say- 
ing: “Unclutter. Decong.” 

Aces Jack went to meet him, 
saying: “Twonce. Wantroduce 

chronaut from twencent. Marcers 
Bill. Bill, Phoebes Dick.” 

“Do,” Phoebes Dick said in the 
clipped speech that apparently 
was the proper language of 2177. 
He gave Marcer a brief look and 
turned away to Aces Jack. “Go- 
ing? Must unsnarl.” 

He went back to the patient 
traffic jam as Jenfooz £kl and 
Jeems Kenth led the group to- 
ward a building shaped, Marcer 
thought, something like a ham- 
burger. He felt a bit hurt by 
Phoebes Dick’s abruptness. The 
man could have looked up at least 
one slang expression, for polite- 
ness’ sake. 

Jeems Kenth seemed to sense 
Marcer’s disappointment. “P.D.’s 
a cop,” he said. “You savvy how 
cops are on duty. Dum-da-da- 
dum.” 

“Check,” Marcer said. He had 
no idea what the musical phrase 
was meant to convey. 

A BIG table had been reserved 
for them at the hamburger 
joint, as Marcer felt obliged to 

98 



call it. Bowls on the table were 
piled high with familiar raw fruit 
and unfamiliar prepared foods. 

“Yes, we have no bananas,” said 
Lucez Hank brightly, although 
they had. “Pile in. Your stomach 
must think your throat’s been 
cut.” 

“That’s right,” Marcer nodded 
agreeably. “Haven’t eaten for a 
couple of hundred years, come to 
think of it.” 

Everybody laughed uproari- 
ously and for a while there was 
no conversation, only the soimd 
of eating, which was done with 
the fingers. 

As Bill Marcer chewed, he 
studied his hosts, thinking of their 
names. They had called him Mar- 
cers Bill, inverting it. Back when 
surnames began to be used, peo- 
ple took them from occupations: 
Miller, Goldsmith, Wheeler, Hun- 
ter. Then the sons: Robertson, 
son of Robert— Robert’s son. That 
seemed to be the style again, here 
in 2177. Jeems Kenth, then, had 
been Jeem’s Kenneth or — of 
course! — GM’s Kenneth. 

He turned to Kenth, waving a 
dripless algyburger excitedly. 
“You’re with General Motors, 
aren’t yoii?” 

Kenth beamed. “Solid, Jack- 
son.” 

Marcer turned to the man on 
his left. “And Jenfooz Ed. Gen- 
eral Foods?” 

“Sensash!” Ed agreed. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“And Stands Thom would be 
with Standard Oil, and Sperris 
Theo with Sperry’s, and Lucez 
Hank with Luce’s — publishing. 
Right?” 

“The kid’s a wonder,” Wobanx 
Joce said from across the table. 
“Now dig me and Aces Jack.” 
“Wobanx.” Marcer pondered it. 
“World Bank?” he guessed. They 
nodded in delight. “But Aces 
Jack? You’ve got me there, un- 
less you’re in the playing-card 
business.” 

Jack grinned. “Higher stakes. 
Try AEG.” 

“Atomic Energy Commission?” 
“Corporation. Defederalized.” 
“Of course,” Marcer said. “Then 
that cop — Phoebes Dick. Could 
Phoebe be FBI?” 

“Bull’s eye!” said Lucez Hank. 
“Now you level with us, Marcers 
Bill. What’s your line?” 

“None, really. I’m what the pa- 
pers call the heir to a silicone for- 
tune. Just a playboy with a lot of 
money, which is why I’m here. 
I guess if I had any descendants, 
one of them might be Slix Bill. 
Tell me,” he said, forgetting to 
slang it up in his excitement, “is 
there anybody like that around? 
Could I see him?” 

There was a silence that Mar- 
cer took for embarrassment. Stan- 
ols Thom broke it with a laugh. 
“That’d be illegal, Fosdick, old 
boy. It’d be like wising you up to 
when you were going , to kick the 

GEORGE ALL THE WAY 



bucket. Couldn’t tip your mitt, 
you know.” 

“It wouldn’t matter,” Marcer 
said. “I won’t remember any of 
this, anyhow. Didn’t they tell you, 
when they arranged my trip, that 
I’ll have an amnesia shot when I 
get back? Time travel’s still top 
secret in 1977.” 

“Fill us in,” Jeems Kenth said. 
“We have the general picture, of 
course, but you’re a history book 
on legs. Give us the straight 
lowdown.” 

"D ILL MARCER flicked crumbs 
from his algyburger into the 
disposal slot in the middle of the 
table. “Well,” he said, “time travel 
was a Government project till it 
ran into budget trouble. Budgets 
haven’t become obsolete, have 
they?” 

They shook their heads, smiling 
ruefully. 

For years, he told them. Con- 
gress had appropriated money 
and the top-secret Ingersoll Proj- 
ect had gobbled it up, without 
notable success. 

On its best try, IP sent an ex- 
pendable research worker five 
minutes into the future. He didn’t 
come back. But when the five 
minutes had elapsed, there he 
was. The intervening time simply 
hadn’t existed for him. 

This sort of research didn’t 
seem productive, economically or 
militarily. The costs worked out 

99 



to about a hundred million dol- 
lars a minute, so the House Ap- 
propriations Committee balked at 
voting new billions for the next 
year’s program. One committee 
member wanted to know if there 
wasn’t a private agency that could 
carry on. The Rockefellers, 
maybe, or the Fords. The com- 
mittee counsel was instructed to 
look into it. 

His looking produced the Phle- 
ger Foundation, consisting of the 
tax-free millions of a West Coast 
airplane manufacturer. Phleger 
set up his Foundation’s time divi- 
sion in a vast piece of property 
outside Los Angeles, which he’d 
taken over in one of his less in- 
spired mergers. The property had 
been vacant for years and the 
chronicians swarmed in. 

To the Phleger people, the fact 
that someone had gone five min- 
utes into the future proved time 
travel practical. The principle 
had to be the same for five years, 
a jump they eventually achieved. 
But these were one-way trips and 
valuable chronicians were lost to 
research for whatever span of 
time they jumped. 

Then, one historic day, a round 
trip was achieved. From that time 
on, the Foundation began to earn 
money faster than it could be 
spent. It accomplished this by 
making time travel a pla 5 dhing 
of the idle rich. 

Old Philip Phleger personally 

100 



took charge of hawking tours to 
Phleger’s future among adventur- 
ous young millionaires whose cur- 
rent fad, motor-sledding in the 
Antarctic, had begun to pall. 

“Have you tried phluttering?” 
Old Man Phleger would say. “It’s 
the latest thing. Certain tax ad- 
vantages, too, you know.” 

Bill Marcer, after Phleger’s le- 
gal section codified, his medical 
people examined, his psycholo- 
gists analyzed, and the Old Man 
himself had a whirl at it, was 
among the first non-professionals 
to phlutter. 

Marcer signed the check, the 
waiver and the medical form and 
climbed onto the open-railed plat- 
form in the great shed. The shim- 
mering came, obscuring the fig- 
ures of the chronicians watching 
him intently from their banks of 
machines. Things went gray, he 
sneezed a couple of times and, 
gripping the railing tightly, he 
phluttered into 2177. 

A ND here I am,” he told 
■^Jeems and Aces and Stan- 
ols and the rest. “Just a playboy 
on a fling. It’s certainly been good 
of you to give up your valuable 
time to entertain me.” 

“Not at all,” Aces Jack said 
pleasantly. “Don’t low-rate your- 
self. It takes two to tango.” 

“If you mean my money and 
Phleger’s brains, you’re right. 
Well, then, if you don’t mind, I’d 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



like to see more of 2177. Tve only 
got two hours.” 

Jeems Kenth looked at his 
wristwatch. 

“Why, that’s the same as mine,” 
Marcer said. He pushed up his 
sleeve to compare them. “A Ham- 
ilton.” 

“An heirloom,” Kenth ex- 
plained. “Been in the family for 
generations. My time is your 
time, eh, Rudy?” 

Marcer laughed. “I’ve heard of 
Rudy Vallee, of course, but he 
was really before my time. You 
know, if you don’t mind my say- 
ing so, all these slang expressions 
— well, they’re a bit of a strain. 
We speak— spoke— pretty straight 
English back in 1977.” 

1^ ENTH looked hurt. “We were 
trying to make you feel 
at home. I, for one, put in many 
an hour at the histoviewer to 
learn your quaint expressions.” 

“Oh, I’m sorry. I’ve offended 
you.” 

“Forget it,” Jenfooz Ed broke 
in. “Sweep it under the rug. Look, 
fellas, our man from the past has 
to go back soon and we’re wast- 
ing his valuable time. And I do 
mean valuable, eh. Bill? I’ll bet 
Old Man Phleger took a stack of 
the green before he let you climb 
aboard.” 

“I have some left,” Marcer 
grinned. 

“Well, you won’t spend it here. 



Everything’s on the house. Now 
what would you like to do? How 
about — ” 

“I’d like to see what you’re do- 
ing with silicones,” Marcer inter- 
rupted. “It’s the family business, 
you know. I’ll probably be going 
into it when or if I settle down.” 
“Great idea,” Aces Jack said, 
“but I’m afraid the slix works is 
pretty far out. You’d never get 
back in time to go back in time, if 
you follow me. We’ve got to get 
you on that platform when the 
gong sounds or I hate to think 
what’d happen to your molecules.” 

“Oh?” Marcer said in alarm. “I 
didn’t know—” 

“Never fear,” Jenfooz Ekl 
boomed. “We’ll see that you’re de- 
phluttered in one piece. What I 
was going to say was, why don’t 
we give our guest a gander at the 
girly line?” 

“Girly line?” Marcer bright- 
ened. “You mean women? Come 
to think of it, I haven’t seen any 
of your women. They’re not ex- 
tinct, are they?” 

“Perish forbid!” Stanols Thom 
exclaimed. “Let’s show the young 
buck.” 

“Bring on the girls!” cried Jen- 
fooz Eki. “Va-va-voom!” He ran to 
a door on which the word Women 
was lettered. 

“Open the door, Richard!” Aces 
Jack shouted to him. “Let there 
be titillation for our guest in his 
last remaining minutes!”

T he door opened and Bill Mar- 
cer was indeed titillated by 
the bevy of near-buxom young 
women who emerged in a little 
dancing run. Lilting music from 
hidden speakers accompanied 
their entry. £^ch wore a differ- 
ently daring costume and each 
danced up to him and introduced 
herself with a kiss and a verse. 

“I’m Daysend Mae, for your 
hours of play,” said a red-headed 
charmer. 

A raven-haired beauty told him : 
“They call me Jet; I help you 
forget.” 

“Abandon your worry and play 
with Terri,” recited a striking 
blonde. 

Marcer’s head was swimming 
from the subtly changing whiffs 
of perfume. He was laughing in 
delight and had difficulty pucker- 
ing his lips to do justice to the 
variegated kisses he was receiving. 

He grabbed at the fourth girl 
and for a delicious moment held 
her in his arms. This one whis- 
pered: “I’m off at six, honey. Meet 
me at Exit C.” She gave him a 
little bump with her tummy and 
winked as she danced away. 

Before he could digest her mes- 
sage— she was a most appealing 
strawberry blonde — an aubum- 
haired dream was upon him, coo- 
ing: “Flee with Bea beyond the 
sea.” She flickered her long eye- 
lashes against his cheek as she be- 
stowed her kiss. 

GEORGE ALL THE WAY 



A great gong soimded just as he 
was puckering up for a statuesque 
creature whose hair he failed to 
notice because of her other assets. 
But at a gesture from Jeems 
Kenth, she reversed her dance 
and flitted away. “Sorry, big boy,” 
she said. “Time’s up.” 

And off they went, the gorgeous 
lot of them, doing a little time 
step back through the door 
marked Women. 

Marcer, dizzy and lipsticked, 
reluctantly permitted himself to 
be led out of the building to the 
platform that was to take him 
back to 1977. 

“That was fun,” Marcer said, 
“but what was it? Is that the way 
you choose your — uh — compan- 
ions in 2177?” 

“One of the ways,” Sperris Theo 
said. “Those were the playgirls. 
For a more permanent alliance, 
there’s the mate date. We knew 
you wouldn’t have time for that.” 
“Hated to drag you away,” Aces 
Jack put in, “but we can’t have 
your molecules congealing.” 
“Been great having you,” Lucez 
Hank told him. “Now on your 
horse and awa-a-y!” 

Marcer climbed up on the plat- 
form. His hosts gathered around 
it to shake hands. Even Phoebes 
Dick, holding back traffic for his 
departure, gave him a clipped 
salute. 

“I can’t tell you how much I en- 
joyed knowing you all,” Marcer 

103 



said. He searched for words. “It 
was the — the cat’s pajamas.” 
They were laughing and wav- 
ing while the shimmering began. 

"WTHEN the shimmering 
” stopped, he was back in the 
shed. Back in the dull past of his 
own time, he thought, with the 
sweet kisses of the future still 
tingling his lips. In a moment, he 
supposed, he’d get his amnesia 
shot. Meanwhile, he savored his 
memory. 

The chronicians were shouting 
and milling around. 

“Get that curtain up!” someone 
seemed to be yelling. 

“Throw something over those 
mockups,” somebody else cried, 
“and, for God’s sake, get out of 
here with those costumes. Some- 
thing’s gone wrong with the shim!” 
Marcer clutched the platform 
rail and stared. He couldn’t see 
too well because they had a spot- 
light on him and the rest of the 
shed was dim. But wasn’t that 
Wobanx Joce disappearing 
through a door? And Jeems Kenth 
crowding behind him, throwing a 
look of consternation over his 
shoulder? Kenth, the one who’d 
worn that “heirloom” wristwatch. 

And at the other side of the big 
room, peeping out from behind a 
slab of painted scenery — wasn’t 
that a giggling gang of girls, 
among whom could be discerned 
Jet and Terri and Daysend Mae? 

104 



Chorus girls. Undoubtedly, for 
there among them was the straw- 
berry blonde, looking boldly at 
him and holding up six fingers. 
‘Tm off at six, honey,” she had 
told him in “2177.” 

He’d been taken for a joyride 
into a phony future. Swindled. 
Bilked. 

Angrily he looked around for 
Old Man Phleger. He didn’t see 
him. But there was the top “chro- 
nician,” Wagner, the chief of staff 
of these confidence men who had 
tried to rook him so expensively. 
Wagner, a harassed, perspiring 
man in a smock, was scurrying 
desperately from one bank of con- 
trols to another, throwing occa- 
sional hopieless glances at Marcer. 

“Wagner!” Marcer said. “You 
crook! Wait till I get my hands 
on you!” He climbed over the rail. 

Wagner threw out his hands 
appealingly. “Don’t get excited, 
Mr. Marcer. I know what you 
think, but it’s not that way at all. 
I mean not entirely. I can ex- 
plain.” 

“You’ll explain to the police,” 
Marcer said. “I’ve had all the ex- 
planation I need. Phleger’s future! 
Nothing but movie sets!” 

“Please, Mr. Marcer—” 
“—federal offense,” Marcer said, 
unheeding. “I’m sure the FBI will 
be interested, too^. You even had 
the gall to hang their name on 
pne of your actors. ‘Phoebes 
Dick’!” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Now, Mr. Marcer— ” 
“Va-va-voom!” Marcer shouted 
at him. “Oh, phlut-phlut! Yes, we 
have no bananas! Very clever! 
The music goes round and round 
and it comes out fraud. Twenty- 
three skiddoo to you, kiddo. I’ll 
be seeing you in court.” 

“Mr. Marcer, listen to me,” 
Wagner pleaded. “I admit we 
staged the whole thing. I admit it 
and I’ll tear up your check if you 
want me to. But first listen. Time 
travel is possible. You would have 
gone into the legitimate future if 
our machine hadn’t broken down 
at the last minute.” 

Wagner’s earnestness was ob- 
vious. 

“The machine broke down?” 

W AGNER wiped his forehead 
with the sleeve of his smock. 
“We didn’t want to disappoint 
you. Frankly, we were afraid that 
if we weren’t ready on time, you’d 
change your mind about your do- 
nation, and we needed the money. 
So we faked it, intending to ex- 
plain later and give you a rain 
check.” 

“A rain check?” Marcer echoed. 
“Yes. When the machine is re- 
paired, we’re prepared to send 
you into the legitimate future — 
free of charge — if you’re still in- 
terested.” 

“Free?” Marcer calmed down. 
“Well, now.” He considered. “I 
guess there’s nothing to lose. I 

GEORGE All THE WAY 



could Stop payment on the check 
even if you didn’t tear it up.” 

“We’ll tear it up. After this fi- 
asco, we need your good will even 
more than your money.” 

HE PHLEGER people fixed 
their machine within a week. 

Bill Marcer thought it over, 
went back, laughed with Wagner 
and let his check go through. He 
signed a new waiver and climbed 
up on the railed platform. 

His decision might have been 
influenced by the strawberry 
blonde, whose role in the phony 
follies of 2177 was the only one 
that really meant anything. She’d 
waited for him, as she had prom- 
ised, at Exit C, at six. 

Now the shimmering began and 
the figures of Wagner and the 
other chronicians faded. 

Marcer didn’t like anything 
about the real future. It was chill 
and drizzly and he couldn’t see 
very far. Men in gray uniforms 
ringed the platform. They 
wouldn’t talk to him and refused 
to let him climb over the rail. His 
visit lasted only ten minutes, but 
it seemed an hour and he kept 
sneezing all the time. 

He preferred the fake. 

When he got back from this 
damp nothing of a future, he 
promised himself, he and the 
strawberry blonde were going to 
have a mate date.

JACKPOT 



I FOUND Doc in the dispen- 
sary. He had on quite a load. 
I worked him over some to 
bring him half awake. 

“Get sobered up,” I ordered 
curtly. “We made planetfall. 
We’ve got work to do.” 

I took the bottle and corked it 
and set it high up on the shelf, 
where it wasn’t right at hand. 

Doc managed to achieve some 
dignity. “You needn’t worry. Cap- 
tain. As medic of this tub — ” 

“I want all hands up and mov- 
ing. We may have something out 
there.” 

“I know,” Doc said mournfully. 
“When you talk like that, it’s 
bound to be a tough one. An off- 
beat climate and atmosphere pure 
poison.” 

“It’s Earth-type, oxygen, and 
the climate’s fine so far. Nothing 
to be afraid of. The analyzers 
gave it almost perfect rating.” 
Doc groaned and held his head

between his hands. “Those analyz- 
ers of ours do very well if they 
tell us whether it is hot or cold or 
if the air is fit to breathe. We’re 
a haywire outfit, Captain.” 

“We do all right,” I said. 

“We’re scavengers and some- 
times birds of prey. We scour the 
Galaxy for an3?thing that’s loose.” 

I paid no attention to him. 
That was the way he always 
talked when he had a skin full. 

“You get up to the galley,” I 
told him, “and let Pancake pour 
some coffee into you. I want you 
on your feet and able to do your 
fumbling best.” 

But Doc wasn’t ready to go 
just yet. “What is it this time?” 

“A silo. The biggest thing you 
ever saw. It’s ten or fifteen miles 
across and goes up clear out of 
sight.” 

“A silo is a building to store 
winter forage. Is this a farming 
planet?” 

“No,” I said, “it’s desert. And it 
isn’t a silo. It just looks like one.” 

“Warehouse?” asked Doc. 
“City? Fortress? Temple — but 
that doesn’t make any difference 
to us, does it. Captain? We loot 
temples, too.” 

“Get up!” I yelled at him. “Get 
going.” 

UE MADE it to his feet. “I 
imagine the populace has 
come out to greet us. Appropri- 
ately, I hope.” 



“There’s no populace,” I said. 
“The silo’s just standing there 
alone.” 

“Well, well,” said Doc. “A sec- 
ond-story job.” 

He started staggering up the 
catwalk and I knew he’d be all 
right. Pancake knew exactly how 
to get him sobered up. 

I went back to the port and 
found that Frost had everything 
all set. He had the guns ready 
and the axes and the sledges, the 
coils of rope and the canteens of 
water and all the stuff we’d need. 
As second in command. Frost was 
invaluable. He knew what to do 
and did it. I don’t know what I’d 
have done without him. 

I stood in the port and looked 
out at the silo. We were a mile or 
so away from it, but it was so big 
that it seemed to be much closer. 
This near to it, it seemed to be a 
wall. It was just God-awful big. 

“A place like that,” said Frost, 
“could hold a lot of loot.” 

“If it isn’t empty,” I answered. 
“If there isn’t someone or some- 
thing there to stop us taking it. If 
we can get into it.” 

“There are openings along the 
base. They look like entrances.” 
“With doors ten feet thick.” 

I wasn’t being pessimistic. I 
was being logical — I’d seen so 
many things that looked like bil- 
lions turn into complicated head- 
aches that I never allowed myself 
much hope until I had my hands

on something I knew would bring 
us cash. 

Hutch Murdock, the engineer, 
came climbing up the catwalk. As 
usual, he had troubles. He didn’t 
even stop to catch his breath. 

“I tell you,” he said to me, “one 
of these days those engines will 
just simply fall apart and leave 
us hanging out in space light- 
years from nowhere. We work all 
the blessed time to keep them 
turning over.” 

I clapped him on the shoulder. 
“Maybe this is it. Maybe after 
this we can buy a brand-new 
ship.” 

But it didn’t cheer him up. He 
knew as well as I did that I was 
talking to keep up my spirit as 
well as his. 

“Someday,” he said, “we’ll have 
bad trouble on our hands. Those 
boys of mine will drive a soap 
bubble across three hundred light- 
years if it’s got an engine in it. 
But it’s got to have an engine. 
And this wreck we got . .” 

He would have kept right on, 
but Pancake blew the horn for 
breakfast. 

rkOC WAS already at the table 
and he seemed to be func- 
tioning. He had a moderate case 
of shudders and he seemed a lit- 
tle pale. He was a little bitter, too, 
and somewhat poetic. 

“So we gather glory,” he told 
us. “We go out and lap it up. We 



haunt the ruins and we track the 
dream and we come up dripping 
cash.” 

“Doc,” I said, “shut up.” 

He shut up. There was no one 
on the ship I had to speak to 
twice. 

We didn’t dally with the food. 
We crammed it down and left. 
Pancake left the dishes standing 
on the table and came along with 
us. 

We got into the silo without 
any trouble. There were entrances 
all around the base and there 
weren’t any doors. There was not 
a thing or anyone to stop us walk- 
ing in. 

It was quiet and solemn inside 

— and unspectacular. It reminded 
me of a monstrous office building. 

It was all cut up with corridors, 
with openings off the corridors 
leading into rooms. The rooms 
were lined with what looked like 
filing cases. 

We walked for quite a while, 
leaving paint markers along the 
walls to lead us back to the en- 
trance. Get lost inside a place like 
that and one could wander maybe 
half a lifetime finding his way 
out. 

We were looking for something 

— almost anything — but we didn’t - 
find a thing except those filing 
cases. 

So we went into one of the 
rooms to have a look inside the 
files. 



JACKPOT 



109 



Pancake was disgusted. “There 
won’t be nothing but records in 
those files. Probably in a lingo 
we can’t even read.” 

“There could be anything in- 
side those files,” said Frost. “They 
don’t have to be records.” 

Pancake had a sledge and he 
lifted it to smash one of the files, 
but I stopped him. There wasn’t 
any use doing it messy if there 
was a better way. 

We fooled around a while and 
we found the place where you 
had to wave your hand to make a 
drawer roll out. 

The drawer was packed with 
what looked like sticks of dyna- 
mite. They were about two 
inches in diameter and a foot, or 
maybe a little more, in length, 
and they were heavy. 

“Gold,” said Hutch. 

“I never saw black gold,” Pan- 
cake said. 

“It isn’t gold,” I told them. 

I was just as glad it wasn’t. If 
it had been, we’d have broken our 
backs hauling it away. Gold’s all 
right, but you can’t get rich on 
it. It doesn’t much more than pay 
wages. 

We dumped out a pile of the 
sticks and squatted on the floor, 
looking them over. 

“Maybe it’s valuable,” said 
Frost, “but I wouldn’t know. What 
do you think it is?” 

None of us had the least idea. 

We found some sort of symbols 

no 



on each end of the sticks and the 
symbols on each stick seemed to 
be different, but it didn’t help us 
any because the symbols made 
no sense. 

We kicked the sticks out of the 
way and opened some more draw- 
ers. Every single drawer was filled 
with the sticks. 

We went into some other rooms 
and we waved our hands some 
more and the drawers came pop- 
ping out and we didn’t find any- 
thing except more sticks. 

Vj^HEN we came out of the silo, 
” the day had turned into a 
scorcher. Pancake climbed the 
ladder to stack us up some grub 
and the rest of us sat down in the 
shade of the ship and laid several 
of the sticks out in front of us and 
sat there looking at them, won- 
dering what we had. 

“That’s where we’re at a big 
disadvantage,” said Hutch. “If a 
regular survey crew stumbled on- 
to this, they’d have all sorts of ex- 
perts to figure out the stuff. 
They’d test it a dozen different 
ways and they’d skin it alive al- 
most and they’d have all sorts of 
ideas and they’d come up with 
some educated guesses. And 
pretty soon, one way or another, 
they’d know just what it was and 
if it was any use.” 

“Someday,” I told them, “if we 
ever strike it rich, we’ll have to 
hire us some experts. The kind 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



of loot we’re always turning up, 
we could make good use of them.” 
“You won’t find any,” said Doc, 
“that would team up with a bunch 
like us.” 

“Where do you get ‘bunch-like- 
us’ stuff?” I asked him, a little 
sore. “Sure, we ain’t got much edu- 
cation and the ship is just sort of 
glued together and we don’t use 
any fancy words to cover up the 
fact that we’re in this for all we 
can get out of it. But we’re doing 
an honest job.” 

“I wouldn’t call it exactly hon- 
est. Sometimes we’re inside the 
law and sometimes outside it.” 
That was nonsense and Doc 
knew it. Mostly where we went, 
there wasn’t any law. 

“Back on Earth, in the early 
days,” I snapped back, “it was 
folks like us who went into new 
lands and blazed the trails and 
found the rivers and climbed the 
mountains and brought back 
word to those who stayed at 
home. And they went because 
they were looking for beaver or 
for gold or slaves or for anjrthing 
else that wasn’t nailed down tight. 
They didn’t worry much about 
the law or the ethics of it and no 
one blamed them for it. They 
found it and they took it and that 
was the end of it. If they killed a 
native or two or burned a village 
or some other minor thing like 
that, why, it was just too bad.” 
Hutch said to Doc: “There 



ain’t no sense in you going holy 
on us. Anything we done, you’re 
in as deep as we are.” 

“Gentlemen,” said Doc, in that 
hammy way of his, “I wasn’t try- 
ing to stir up any ruckus. I was 
just pointing out that you needn’t 
set your heart on getting any ex- 
perts.” 

“We could get them,” I said, “if 
we offered them enough. They got 
to live, just like anybody else.” 

“They have professional pride, 
too. That’s something you’ve for- 
gotten.” 

“We got you.” 

“Well, now,” said Hutch, “I’m 
not too sure Doc is professional. 
That time he pulled the tooth for 
me 

“Cut it out,” I said. “The both 
of you.” 

This wasn’t any time to bring 
up the matter of the tooth. Just 
a couple of months ago, I’d got it 
quieted down and I didn’t want 
it breaking out again. 

T^ROST picked up one of the 
sticks and turned it over and 
over, looking at it. 

“Maybe we could rig up some 
tests,” he suggested. 

“And take the chance of get- 
ting blown up?” asked Hutch. 

“It might not go off. You have 
a better than fifty-fifty chance 
that it’s not explosive.” 

“Not me,” said Doc. “I’d rather 
just sit here and guess. It’s less 



JACKPOT 



111 



tiring and a good deal safer.” 

“You don’t get anywhere by 
guessing,” protested Frost. “We 
might have a fortune right inside 
our mitts if we could only find out 
what these sticks are for. There 
must be tons of them stored in 
the building. And there’s nothing 
in the world to stop us from tak- 
ing them.” 

“The first thing,” I said, “is to 
find out if it’s explosive. I don’t 
think it is. It looks like dynamite, 
but it could be almost anything. 
For instance, it might be food.” 

“We’ll have Pancake cook us 
up a mess,” said Doc. 

I paid no attention to him. He 
was just needling me. 

“Or it might be fuel,” I said. 
“Pop a stick into a ship engine 
that was built to use it and it 
would keep it going for a year or 
two.” 

Pancake blew the chow horn 
and we all went in. 

A FTER we had eaten, we got 
to work. 

We found a flat rock that 
looked like granite and above it 
we set up a tripod made out of 
poles that we had to walk a mile 
to cut and then had to carry back. 
We rigged up a pulley on the tri- 
pod and found another rock and 
tied it to the rope that went up to 
the pulley. Then we paid out the 
rope as far as it would go and 
there we dug a foxhole. 

H2 



By this time, the sun was set- 
ting and we were tuckered out, 
but we decided to go ahead and 
make the test and set our minds 
at rest. 

So I took one of the sticks that 
looked like dynamite and while 
the others back in the foxhole 
hauled up the rock tied to the 
rope, I put the stick on the first 
rock underneath the second and 
then I ran like hell. I tumbled 
into the foxhole and the others 
let go of the rop>e and the rock 
dropped down on the stick. 

Nothing hapjjened. 

Just to make sure, we pulled 
up and dropped the rock two or 
three times more and there was 
no explosion. 

We climbed out of the foxhole 
and went over to the tripod and 
rolled the rock off the stick, which 
wasn’t even dented. 

By this time, we were fairly 
well convinced that the stick 
couldn’t be set off by concussion, 
although the test didn’t rule out 
a dozen other ways it might blow 
us all up. 

That night, we gave the sticks 
the works. We poured acid on 
them and the acid just ran off. 
We tried a cold chisel on them 
and we ruined two good chisels. 
We tried a saw and they stripped 
the teeth clean off. 

We wanted Pancake to try to 
cook one of them, but Pancake 
refused. 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“You aren’t bringing that stuff 
into my galley,” he said. “If you 
do, you can cook for yourselves 
from now on. I keep a good clean 
galley and I try to keep you guys 
well fed and I ain’t having you 
mess up the place . .” 

“All right. Pancake,” I said. 
“Even with you cooking it, it 
probably wouldn’t be fit to eat.” 

W E WOUND up sitting at a 
table, looking at the sticks 
piled in the center of it. Doc 
brought out a bottle and we all 
had a drink or two. Doc must 
have been considerably upset to 
share his liquor with us. 

“It stands to reason,” said 
Frost, “that the sticks are good 
for something. If the cost of that 
building is any indication of their 
value, they’re worth a fortune.” 
“Maybe the sticks aren’t the 
only things in there,” Hutch 
pointed out. “We just covered 
part of the first floor. There might 
be a lot of other stuff in there. 
And there are all those other 
floors. How many would you say 
there were?” 

“Lord knows,” said Frost. 
“When you’re on the ground, you 
can’t be sure you see to the top 
of it. It just sort of fades away 
when you look up at it.” 

“You notice what it was built 
of?” asked Doc. 

“Stone,” said Hutch. 

“I thought so, too,” said Doc. 



“But it isn’t. You remember these 
big apartment mounds we ran 
into in that insect culture out on 
Suud?” 

We all remembered them, of 
course. We’d spent days trying to 
break into them because we had 
found a handful of beautifully 
carved jade scattered around the 
entrance of one of them and we 
figured there might be a lot of it 
inside. Stuff like that brings 
money. Folks back in civilization 
are nuts about any kind of alien 
art and that jade sure enough 
was alien. 

We’d tried every trick that we 
could think of and we got no- 
where. Breaking into those 
mounds was like punching a 
feather pillow. You could dent 
the surface plenty, but you 
couldn’t break it because the 
strength of the material built up 
as pressure compressed the atoms. 
The harder you hit, the tougher 
it became. It was the kind of 
building material that would last 
forever and never need repair 
and those insects must have 
known they were safe from us, for 
they went about their business 
and never noticed us. That’s what 
made it so infuriating. 

And material like that, I real- 
ized, would be just the ticket for 
a structure like the silo. You 
could build as big or as high as 
you had a mind to; the more 
pressure you put on the lower

])3 



structure, the stronger it would 
be. 

“It means,” I said, “that the 
building out there could be much 
older than it seems to be. It could 
be a million years or older.” 

“If it’s that old,” said Hutch, 
“it could really be packed. You 
can store away a lot of loot in a 
million years.” 

Doc and Frost drifted off to 
bed and Hutch and I sat there 
alone, looking at the sticks. 

¥ GOT to thinking about some 
of the things that Doc was al- 
ways saying, about how we were 
just a bunch of cutthroats, and I 
wondered if he might be right. 
But think on it as hard and as 
honest as I could, I couldn’t buy 
it. 

On every expanding frontier, in 
all of history, there had been 
three kinds of men who went 
ahead and marked out the trails 
for other men to follow — the 
traders and the missionaries and 
the hunters. 

We were the hunters in this 
case, hunting not for gold or 
slaves or furs, but for whatever 
we could find. Sometimes we 
came back with empty hands and 
sometimes we made a haul. Usu- 
ally, in the long run, we evened 
out so we made nothing more 
than wages. But we kept on going 
out, hoping for that lucky break 
that would make us billionaires. 

114 



It hadn’t happened yet, and 
perhaps it never would. But some- 
day it might. We touched the 
ghostly edge of hope just often 
enough to keep us thinking that 
it would. Although, I admitted to 
myself, perhaps we’d have kept 
going out even if there’d been no 
hope at all. Seeking for the un- 
known gets into your blood. 

When you came right down to 
it, we probably didn’t do a bit 
more harm than the traders or the 
missionaries. What we took, we 
took; we didn’t settle down and 
change or destroy the civilizations 
of people we pretended we were 
helping. 

I said as much to Hutch. He 
agreed with me. 

“The missionaries are the 
worst,” he said. “I wouldn’t be a 
missionary no matter what they 
paid me.” 

We weren’t doing any good just 
sitting there, so I got up to start 
for bed. 

“Maybe tomorrow we’ll find 
something else,” I said. 

Hutch yawned. “I sure hope we 
do. We been wasting our time on 
these sticks of dynamite.” 

He picked them up and on our 
way up to bed, he heaved them 
out the port. 

The next day, we did find 
something else. 

We went much deeper into the 
silo than we had been before, fol- 
lowing the corridors for what 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



must have been two miles or 
more. 

We came to a big room that 
probably covered ten or fifteen 
acres and it was filled from wall 
to wall with rows of machines, all 
of them alike. 

They weren’t much to look at. 
They resembled to some extent a 
rather ornate washing machine, 
with a bucket seat attached and 
a dome on top. They weren’t 
bolted down and you could push 
them around and when we tipped 
one of them up to look for hidden 
wheels, we found instead a pair of 
runners fixed on a swivel so 
they’d track in any direction that 
one pushed. The runners were 
made of metal that was greasy to 
the touch, but when you rubbed 
your fingers on them, no grease 
came off them. 

There was no power connec- 
tion. 

“Maybe it’s a self-powered 
unit,” said Frost. “Come to think 
of it, I haven’t noticed any power 
outlets in the entire building.” 

HUNTED for some place 
where we could turn on the 
power and there wasn’t any place. 
That whole machine was the 
smoothest, slickest hunk of metal 
you ever saw. We looked for a 
way to get into its innards, so we 
could have a look at them, but 
there wasn’t any way. The jacket 
that covered the works seemed to 



be one solid piece without an ap- 
parent seam or a sign of a bolt or 
rivet. 

The dome looked as though it 
ought to come off and we tried to 
get it off, but it remained stub- 
bornly in place. 

The bucket seat, however, was 
something else again. It was lousy 
with all sorts of attachments to 
accommodate the sitting surface 
of almost any conceivable kind of 
being. We had a lot of fun ad- 
justing it in different ways and 
trying to figure out what kind of 
animal could have a seat like 
that. We got a bit obscene about 
it, I remember, and Hutch was 
doubled up laughing. 

But we weren’t getting any- 
where and we were fairly sure we 
wouldn’t until we could get a cut- 
ting tool and open up one of the 
machines to find out what made 
it tick. 

We picked out one of them 
and we skidded it down the cor- 
ridors. When we got to the en- 
trance, we figured we would have 
to carry it, but we were mistaken. 
It skidded along over the ground 
and even loose sand almost as 
well as it did in the corridors. 

After supper. Hutch went down 
to the engine room and came 
back with a cutting tool. The 
metal was tough, but we finally 
got at least some of the jacket 
peeled away. 

The innards of that machine 



JACKPOT 



115 



were enough to drive you crazy. 
It was a solid mass of tiny parts 
all hooked together in the 
damnedest jumble. There was no 
beginqing and no end. It was like 
one of those puzzle mazes that go 
on and on forever and get no 
place. 

Hutch got into it with both 
hands and tried to figure out how 
to start taking it apart. 

After a while, he sat back on 
his heels and growled a little at 
it. “There’s nothing holding them 
together. Not a bolt or rivet, not 
even so much as a cotter pin. But 
they hang together somehow.” 

“Just pure cussedness,” I said. 

He looked at me kind of funny. 
“You might be right, at that.” 

He went at it again and bashed 
a couple of knuckles and sat there 
sucking at them. 

“If I didn’t know that I was 
wrong,” he said, “I’d say that it 
was friction.” 

“Magnetism,” Doc offered. 

“I tell you what. Doc,” said 
Hutch. “You stick to what little 
medicine wou know and let me 
handle the mechanics.” 

Frost dove in quick to head off 
an argument. “That frictional idea 
might not be a bad one. But it 
would call for perfect machining 
and surface polish. Theoretically, 
if you place two perfectly pol- 
ished surfaces together, the mole- 
cules will attract one another and 
you’ll have permanent cohesion.” 

M6 



T DON’T know where Frost got 
all that stuff. Mostly he seemed 
to be just like the rest of us, but 
occasionally he’d come out with 
something that would catch you 
by surprise. I never asked him 
anything about himself; ques- 
tions like that were just plain bad 
manners. 

We messed around some more 
and Hutch bashed another knuckle 
and I sat there thinking how 
we’d found two items in the silo 
and both of them had stopped us 
in our tracks. But that’s the way 
it is. Some days you can’t make 
a dime. 

Frost moved around and 
pushed Hutch out of the way. 
“Let me see what I can do.” 

Hutch didn’t protest any. He 
was licked. 

Frost started pushing and pull- 
ing and twisting and fiddling 
away at that mess of parts and 
all at once there was a kind of 
whooshing sound, like someone 
had let out their breath sort of 
slow and easy, and all the parts 
fell in upon themselves. They 
came unstuck, in a kind of slow- 
motion manner, and they made a 
metallic thump along with tin- 
kling sounds and they were just a 
heap inside the jacket that had 
protected them. 

“Now see what you done!” 
howled Hutch. 

“I didn’t do a thing,” said Frost. 
“I was just seeing if I could bust 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



one loose and one did and then 
the whole shebang caved in.” 

He held up his fingers to show 
us the piece that had come loose. 

“You know what I think?” 
asked Pancake. “I think whoever 
made that machine made it so it 
would fall apart if anyone tried 
to tinker with it. They didn’t 
want no one to find out how it 
was put together.” 

“That makes sense,” said Doc. 
“No use getting peeved at it. Af- 
ter all, it was their machine.” 
“Doc,” I said, “you got a funny 
attitude. I never noticed you turn- 
ing down your share of anything 
we find.” 

“I don’t mind when we confine 
ourselves to what you might call, 
in all politeness, natural resources. 
I can even stomach the pillaging 
of art-forms. But when it comes 
to stealing brains — and this ma- 
chine is brains—” 

Frost let out a whoop. 

He was hunkered down, with 
his head inside the jacket of the 
machine, and I thought at first 
he’d got caught and that we’d 
have to cut him out, but he could 
get out, all right. 

“I see now how to get that dome 
off the top,” he said. 

It was a complicated business, 
almost like a combination on a 
safe. The dome was locked in 
place by a lot of grooves and you 
had to know just how to turn it 
to lift it out of place. 



Frost kept his head inside the 
jacket and called out directions 
to Hutch, who twisted the dome 
first this way and then that, some- 
times having to pull up on it and 
other times press down to engage 
the slotted mechanism that held 
it locked in place. Pancake wrote 
down the combinations as Frost 
called them off and finally the 
dome came loose in Hutch’s 
hands. 

NCE it was off, there was no 
mystery to it. It was a hel- 
met, all rigged out with adjust- 
able features so it could be made 
to fit any type of head, just as the 
seat was adjustable to fit any sit- 
ting apparatus. 

The helmet was attached to the 
machine with a retractable cable 
that reeled out far enough to 
reach someone sitting in the seat. 

And that was fine, of course. 
But what was it? A portable elec- 
tric chair? A permanent wave ma- 
chine? Or what? 

So Frost and Hutch poked 
around some more and in the top 
of the machine, just under where 
the dome had nested, they found 
a swivel trap door and under- 
neath it a hollow tube extending 
down into the mass of innards — 
only the innards weren’t a mass 
any more, but just a basket of 
loose parts. 

It didn’t take any imagination 
to figure what that hollow tube 



JACKPOT 



117 



was for. It was just the size to 
take one of the sticks of dyna- 
mite. 

Doc went and got a bottle and 
passed it around as a sort of cele- 
bration and after a drink or two, 
he and Hutch shook hands and 
said there were no hard feelings. 
But I didn’t pay much attention 
to that. They’d done it many 
times before and then been at one 
another’s throat before the night 
was over. 

Just why we were celebrating 
was hard to figure. Sure, we knew 
the machine fitted heads and that 
the dynamite fitted the machine 
— but we still had no idea what it 
was all about. 

We were, to tell the truth, just 
a little scared, although you 
couldn’t have gotten one of us to 
admit it. 

We did some guessing, natu- 
rally. 

“It might be a mechanical doc- 
tor,” said Hutch. “Just sit in that 
seat and put the helmet on your 
head and feed in the proper stick 
and you come out cured of what- 
ever is wrong with you. It would 
be a blessing, I can tell you. You 
wouldn’t ever need to worry if 
your doctor knew his business or 
not.” 

I thought Doc was going to 
jump right down Hutch’s throat, 
but he must have remembered 
how they had shaken hands and 
he didn’t do it. 



“As long as you’re thinking 
along that line,” said Doc, “let’s 
think a little bigger. Let’s say it 
is a rejuvenation machine and 
the stick is crammed with vita- 
mins and hormones and such that 
turn you young again. Just take 
the treatment every twenty years 
or so and you stay young for- 
ever.” 

“It might be an educator,” 
Frost put in. “Those sticks might 




IIS 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 






be packed full of knowledge. 
Maybe a complete college sub- 
ject inside of each of them.” 

“Or it might be just the oppo- 
site,” said Pancake. '“Those sticks 
might soak up everything you 
know. E^ch of those sticks might 
be the story of one man’s whole 
life.” 

“Why record life stories?” 
asked Hutch. “There aren’t many 
men or aliens or what-not that 



have life stories important enough 
to rate all that trouble.” 

“If you’re thinking of it being 
some sort of communications 
deal,” I said, “it might be any- 
thing. It might be propaganda or 
religion or maps or it might be no 
more than a hie of business rec- 
ords.” 

“And,” said Hutch, “it might 
kill you deader than a mackerel.” 
“I don’t think so,” Doc replied.

“There are easier ways to kill a 
person than to sit him in a chair 
and put a helmet on him. And it 
doesn’t have to be a communi- 
cator.” 

“There’s one way to find out,” 
I said. 

“I was afraid,” said Doc, “we’d 
get around to that.” 

“It’s too complicated,” argued 
Hutch. “No telling what trouble 
it may get us into. Why not drop 
it cold? We can blast off and hunt 
for something simple.” 

“No!” shouted Frost. “We can’t 
do that!” 

“I’d like to know why not,” 
said Hutch. 

“Because we’d always wonder 
if we passed up the jackp>ot. We’d 
figure that maybe we gave up too 
quick — a day or two too quick. 
That we got scared out. That if 
we’d gone ahead, we’d be rolling 
in moriey.” 

■^E KNEW Frost was right, 
^ but we batted it around 
some more before we would ad- 
mit he was. All of us knew what 
we had to do, but there were no 
volunteers. 

Finally we drew straws and 
Pancake was unlucky. 

“Okay,” I said. “First thing in 
the morning . .” 

“Morning, nothing!” wailed Pan- 
cake. “I want to get it over with. 
I wouldn’t sleep a wink.” 

He was scared, all right, and he 

120 



had a right to be. He felt just the 
way I would have if I’d drawn 
the shortest straw. 

I didn’t like barging around on 
an alien planet after dark, but we 
had to do it. It wouldn’t have 
been fair to Pancake to have done 
otherwise. And, besides, we were 
all wrought up and we’d have no 
rest until we’d found out what we 
had. 

So we got some flashes arid 
went out to the silo. We tramped 
down the corridors for what 
seemed an endless time and came 
to the room where the machines 
were stored. 

There didn’t seem to be any 
difference in the machines, so we 
picked one at random. While 
Hutch got the helmet off, I ad- 
justed the seat for Pancake and 
Doc went into an adjoining room 
to get a stick. 

When we were all ready. Pan- 
cake sat down in the seat. 

I had a sudden rush of imbe- 
cility. 

“Look,” I said to Pancake, “you 
don’t need to do this.” 

“Someone has to,” said Pan- 
cake. “We got to find out some- 
how and this is the quickest way.” 

“I’ll take your place.” 

Pancake called me a dirty 
name and he had no right to do 
that, for I was only being helpful. 
But I called him another and we 
were back to normal. 

Hutch put the helmet on Pan- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



cake’s head and it came down so 
far you couldn’t see his face. Doc 
popped the stick into the tube 
and the machine purred a little, 
starting up, then settled into si- 
lence. Not exactly silence, either 
— when you laid your ear against 
the jacket, you could hear it run- 
ning. 

Nothing seemed to happen to 
Pancake. He sat there cool and 
relaxed and Doc got to work on 
him at once, checking him over. 

“His pulse has slowed a little,” 
Doc reported, “and his heart ac- 
tion’s sort of feeble, but he seems 
to be in no danger. His breathing 
is a little shallow, but not enough 
to worry about.” 

It might not have meant a 
thing to Doc, but it made the rest 
of us uneasy. We stood around 
and watched and nothing hap- 
I>ened. I don’t know what we 
thought might happen. Funny as 
it sounds, I had thought that 
something would. 

TAOC kept close watch, but Pan- 
cake got no worse. 

We waited and we waited. The 
machine kept running and Pan- 
cake sat slumped in the seat. He 
was as limp as a dog asleep and 
when you picked up his hand, 
you’d think his bones had melted 
plumb away. All the time we got 
more nervous. Hutch wanted to 
jerk the helmet off Pancake, but 
I wouldn’t let him. No telling 



what might happen if we stopped 
the business in the middle. 

It was about an hour after 
dawn that the machine stopped 
running. Pancake began to stir 
and we removed the helmet. 

He yawned and rubbed his 
eyes and sat up straight. He 
looked a bit surprised when he 
saw us and it seemed to take a 
moment for him to recognize us. 

“What happened?” Hutch 
asked him. 

Pancake didn’t answer. You 
could see him pulling himself to- 
gether, as if he were remember- 
ing and getting his bearings once 
again. 

“I went on a trip,” he said. 

“A travelogue!” said Doc, dis- 
gusted. 

“Not a travelogue. I was there. 
It was a planet, way out at the 
rim of the Galaxy, I think. There 
weren’t many stars at night be- 
cause it was so far out — way out 
where the stars get thin and there 
aren’t many of them. There was 
just a thin strip of light that 
moved overhead.” 

“Looking at the Galaxy edge- 
on,” said Frost, nodding. “Like 
you were looking at a buzz-saw’s 
cutting edge.” 

“How long was I under?” asked 
Pancake. 

“Long enough,” I told him. “Six 
or seven hours. We were getting 
nervous.” 

“That’s funny,” said Pancake. 



JACKPOT 



121 



“I’ll swear I was there for a year 
or more.” 

“Now let’s get this straight,” 
Hutch said. “You say you were 
there. You mean you saw this 
place.” 

“I mean I was there!” yelled 
Pancake. “I lived with those peo- 
ple and I slept in their burrows 
and I talked with them and I 
worked with them. I got a blood 
blister on my hand from hoeing 
in a garden. I traveled from one 
place to another and I saw a lot 
of things and it was just as real 
as sitting here.” 

We bundled him out of there 
and went back to the ship. Hutch 
wouldn’t let Pancake get the 
breakfast. He threw it together 
himself and since Hutch is a lousy 
cook, it was a miserable meal. 
Doc dug up a bottle and gave 
Pancake a drink, but he wouldn’t 
let any of the rest of us have any 
of it. Said it was medicinal, not 
social. 

That’s the way he is at times. 
Downright hog-selfish. 

Pancake told us about this 
place he had been to. It didn’t 
seem to have much, if any, gov- 
ernment, mostly because it didn’t 
seem to need one, but was a hum- 
ble sort of planet where rather 
dim-witted people lived in a prim- 
itive agricultural state. They 
looked, he said, like a cross be- 
tween a human and a groundhog, 
and he drew a picture of them, 

m 



but it didn’t help a lot, for Pan- 
cake is no artist. 

He told us the kind of crops 
they raised, and there were some 
screwy kinds, and what kind of 
food they ate, and we gagged at 
some of it, and he even had some 
of the place names down pat and 
he remembered shreds of the lan- 
guage and it was outlandish- 
sounding. 

We asked him all sorts of ques- 
tions and he had the answers to 
every one of them and some were 
the kind he could not have made 
up from his head. Even Doc, who 
had been skeptical to start with, 
was ready to admit that Pancake 
had visited the planet. 

A fter we ate, we hustled 
Pancake off to bed and Doc 
checked him over and he was all 
right. 

When Pancake and Doc had 
left. Hutch said to me and Frost: 
“I can feel those dollars clinking 
in my pocket right this minute.” 
We both agreed with him. 

We’d found an entertainment 
gadget that had anything yet 
known backed clear off the map. 

The sticks were recordings that 
packed in not only sight and 
sound, but stimuli for all the other 
senses. They did the job so well 
that anyone subjected to their in- 
fluence felt that he was part of 
the environment they presented. 
He stepped into the picture and 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



became a part of it. He was really 
there. 

Frost already was planning ex- 
actly how we’d work it. 

“We could sell the stuff,” he 
said, “but that would be rather 
foolish. We want to keep control 
of it. We’ll lease out the machines 
and we’ll rent the sticks and since 
we’ll have the sole supply, we can 
charge anything we wish.” 

“We can advertise year-long 
vacations that take less than half 
a day,” said Hutch. “They’ll be 
just the thing for executives and 
other busy people. Why, in a sin- 
gle weekend you could spend 
four or five years’ time on several 
different planets.” 

“Maybe it’s not only planets,” 
Frost went on. “There might be 
concerts or art galleries and mu- 
seums. Maybe lectures on history 
and literature and such.” 

We were feeling pretty good, 
but we were tuckered out, so we 
trailed off to bed. 

I didn’t get into bed right away, 
however, but hauled out the log. 
I don’t know why I ever bothered 
with it. It was a hit-and-miss af- 
fair at best. There would be 
months I’d not even think about 
it and then all at once I’d get all 
neat and orderly and keep a faith- 
ful record for several weeks or so. 
There was no real reason to make 
an entry in it now, but I was 
somewhat excited and had a feel- 
ing that perhaps what had just 



happened should be put down in 
black and white. 

So I crawled under the bunk 
and pulled out the tin box I kept 
it and the other papers in, and 
while I was lifting it to the bunk, 
it slipped out of my hands. The 
lid flew open. The log and all the 
pajjers and the other odds and 
ends I kept there scattered on the 
floor. 

I cussed a bit and got down 
on my hands and knees to pick up 
the mess. There was an awful lot 
of it and most of it was junk. 
Someday, I told myself, I’d have 
to throw a lot of it away. There 
were clearance papers from a 
hundred different ports and medi- 
cal certificates and other papers 
that were long outdated. But 
among it I found also the title to 
the ship. 

I sat there thinking back al- 
most twenty years to the day I’d 
bought the ship for next to noth- 
ing and towed it from the junk- 
yard and I recalled how I’d spent 
a couple of years spare time and 
all I could earn getting it patched 
up so it could take to space again. 
No wonder, I told myself, that it 
was a haywire ship. It had been 
junk to start with, and during all 
those years, we’d just managed to 
keep it glued together. There had 
been many times when the only 
thing that got it past inspection 
had been a fast bribe slipped qui- 
etly to the man. No one in the 



JACKPOT 



123 



Galaxy but Hutch could have 
kept it flying. 

¥ WENT on picking up the pa- 
pers, thinking about Hutch 
and all the rest of them. I got a 
little sentimental and thought a 
lot of things I’d have clobbered 
anyone for if they had dared to 
say them to me. About how we 
had stuck together and how any 
one of them would have died for 
me and I for any one of them. 

There had been a time, of 
course, when it had not been that 
way, back in the days when 
they’d first signed on and had 
been nothing but a crew. But that 
day was long past; now they were 
more than just a crew. There had 
been no signing on for years, but 
just staying on as men who had a 
right to stay. And I sat there, flat 
on the floor, and thought how 
we’d finally done the thing we’d 
always hoped to do, how we’d 
caught up with the dream — us, 
the ragamuffin crew in the glued- 
together ship — and I felt proud 
and happy, not for myself alone, 
but for Hutch and Pancake and 
Doc and Frost and all the rest. 

Finally I got the papers all 
picked up and back in the box 
again and tried to write up the 
log, but was too tired to write, so 
I went to bed, as I should have 
done in the first place. 

But tired as I was, I lay there 
and thought of how big the silo 

134 



was and tried to estimate how 
many sticks might be cached 
away there. I got up into the tril- 
lions and I saw it was no use; 
there was no way to keep the fig- 
ures straight. 

The whole deal was big — big- 
ger than anything we’d ever 
found before. It would take a 
group of men like us at least five 
lifetimes of steady hauling to 
empty the silo. We’d have to set 
up a corporation and get a legal 
staff (preferably one with the 
lowest kind of ethics) and file a 
claim on this planet and go 
through a lot of other red tape to 
be sure we had it all sewed up. 

We couldn’t take a chance of 
letting it slip through our fingers 
because of any lack of foresight. 
We’d have to get it all doped out 
before we went ahead. 

I don’t know about the rest of 
them, but I dreamed that night of 
wading knee-deep through a sea 
of crisp, crinkly banknotes. 

When morning came. Doc failed 
to show up for breakfast. I went 
hunting him and found he hadn’t 
even gone to bed. He was 
sprawled in his rickety old chair 
in the dispensary and there was 
one empty bottle on the floor and 
he trailed another, almost empty, 
alongside the chair, keeping a 
rather flimsy hold upon its neck. 
He still was conscious, which was 
about the most that could be said 
of him. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I was plenty sore. Doc knew 
the rules. He could get paralyzed 
as soon or as often or as long as 
he wanted to when we were in 
space, but when we were grounded 
and there was work to do and 
planet ailments to keep an eye 
out for, he was expected to stay 
sober. 

I kicked the bottle out of his 
fist and I took him by the collar 
with one hand and by the seat of 
his britches with the other and 
frog-walked him to the galley. 

pLUNKING him down in a 
chair, I yelled for Pancake to 
get another pot of coffee going. 

“I want you sobered up,” I told 
Doc, “so you can go out with us 
on the second trip. We need all 
the manpower we have.” 

Hutch had rounded up his gang 
and Frost had got the crew to- 
gether and had rigged up a block 
and tackle so we could start load- 
ing. Everyone was ready to begin 
bringing in the cargo except Doc 
and I swore to myself that, be- 
fore the day was over, I’d work 
the tail right off him. 

As soon as we had breakfast, 
we started out. We planned to get 
aboard as many of the machines 
as we could handle and to fill in 
the space between them with all 
the sticks we could find room for. 

We went down the corridors to 
the room that held the machines 
and we paired off, two men to 



the machine, and started out. 
Everything went fine until we 
were more than halfway across 
the stretch of ground between the 
building and the ship. 

Hutch and I were in the lead 
and suddenly there was an explo- 
sion in the ground about fifty feet 
ahead of us. 

We skidded to a halt. 

“It’s Doc!” yelled Hutch, grab- 
bing for his belt-gun. 

I stopped him just in time. 
“Take it easy. Hutch.” 

Doc stood up in the port and 
waved. a rifle at us. 

“I could pick him off,” Hutch 
said. 

“Put back that gun,” I ordered. 
I walked out alone to where 
Doc had placed his bullet. 

He lifted his rifle and I stopped 
dead still. He’d probably miss, 
but even so, the kind of explosive 
charge he was firing could cut a 
man in two if it struck ten feet 
away. 

“I’m going to throw away my 
gun,” I called out to him. “I want 
to talk with you.” 

Doc hesitated for a moment. 
“All right. Tell the rest of them 
to pull back a way.” 

I spoke to Hutch over my 
shoulder. “Get out of here. Take 
the others with you.” 

“He’s crazy drunk,” said Hutch. 
“No telling what he’ll do.” 

“I can handle him,” I said, 
sounding surer than I felt. 



JACKPOT 



125 



Doc let loose another bullet off 
to one side of us. 

“Get moving, Hutch.” I didn’t 
dare look back. I had to keep an 
eye on Doc. 

“All right,” Doc finally yelled 
at me. “They’re back. Throw 
away your gun.” 

|V/fOVING slow so he wouldn’t 
think I was trying to draw 
on him, I unfastened the buckle 
of the gun belt and let it fall to 
the ground. I walked forward, 
keeping my eyes on Doc, and all 
the time my skin kept trying to 
crawl up my back. 

“That’s far enough,” Doc said 
when I’d almost reached the ship. 
“We can talk from here.” 

“You’re drunk,” I told him. “I 
don’t know what this is all about, 
but I know you’re drunk.” 

“Not nearly drunk enough. Not 
drunk enough by half. If I were 
drunk enough, I simply wouldn’t 
care.” 

“What’s eating you?” 
“Decency,” said Doc, in that 
hammy way of his. “I’ve told you 
many times that I can stomach 
looting when it involves no more 
than uranium and gems and other 
trash like that. I can even shut 
my eyes when you gut a culture, 
because you can’t steal a culture 
— even when you get through 
looting it, the culture still is there 
and can build back again. But I 
balk at robbing knowledge. I will 

126 



not let you do it. Captain.” 

“I still say you're drunk.” 
“You don’t even know what 
you’ve found. You are so blind 
and greedy that you don’t recog- 
nize it.” 

“Okay, Doc,” I said, trying to 
smooth his feathers, “tell me what 
we’ve found.” 

“A library. Perhaps the great- 
est, most comprehensive library 
in all the Galaxy. Some race 
spent untold years compiling the 
knowledge that is in that building 
and you plan to take it and sell 
it and scatter it. If that happens, 
in time it will be lost and what 
little of it may be left will be so 
out of context that half its mean- 
ing will be lost. It doesn’t belong 
to us. It doesn’t even belong to 
the human race alone. A library 
like that can belong only to all 
the peoples of the Galaxy.” 
“Look, Doc,” I pleaded, “we’ve 
worked for years, you and I and 
all the rest of them. We’ve bled 
and sweated and been disap- 
pointed time and time again. This 
is our chance to make a killing. 
And that means you as well as the 
rest of us. Think of it. Doc — more 
money than you can ever spend 
— enough to keep you drunk the 
rest of your life!” 

Doc swung the rifle around at 
me and I thought my goose was 
cooked. But I never moved a 
muscle. 

I stood and bluffed it out. 
GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



A t last, he lowered the gun. 

“We’re barbarians. History is 
full of the likes of us. Back on 
Earth, the barbarians stalled hu- 
man progress for a thousand 
years when they burned and scat- 
tered the libraries and the learn- 
ing of the Greeks and Romans. 
To them, books were just some- 
thing to start a fire with or wipe 
their weapons on. To you, this 
great cache of accumulated 
knowledge means nothing more 
than something to make a quick 
buck on. You’ll take a scholarly 
study of a vital social problem 
and retail it as a year’s vacation 
that can be experienced in six 
hours’ time and you’ll take — ” 
“Spare me the lecture, Doc,” I 
said wearily. “Tell me what you 
want.” 

“Go back and report this find 
to the Galactic Commission. It 
will help wipe out a lot of things 
we’ve done.” 

“So help me. Doc, you’ve gone 
religious on us.” 

“Not religious. Just decent.” 
“And if we don’t?” 

“I’ve got the ship,” said Doc. 
“I have the food and water.” 
“You’ll have to sleep.” 

“I’ll close the port. Just try get- 
ting in.” 

He had us and he knew he did. 
Unless we could figure out a way 
to grab him, he had us good and 
proper. 

I was scared, but mostly I was 



burned. For years, we’d listened 
to him run off at the mouth and 
never for a moment had any of 
us thought he meant a word of it. 
And now suddenly he did — he 
meant every word of it. 

I knew there was no way to 
talk him out of it. And there was 
no compromise. When it came 
right down to it, there was no 
agreement possible, for any agree- 
ment or compromise would have 
to be based on honor and we had 
no honor — not a one of us, not 
even among ourselves. It was 
stalemate, but Doc didn’t know 
that yet. He’d realize it once he 
got a little sober and thought 
about it some. What he had done 
had been done on alcoholic im- 
pulse, but that didn’t mean he 
wouldn’t see it through. 

One thing was certain: As it 
stood, he could outlast us. 

“Let me go back,” I said. “I’ll 
have to talk this over with the 
others.” 

1 THINK that Doc right then 
began to suspect how deeply 
he had become committed, began 
to see for the first time the impos- 
sibility of us trusting one another. 

“When you come back,” he told 
me, “have it all thought out. I’ll 
want some guarantees.” 

“Sure, Doc,” I said. 

“I mean this. Captain. I’m in 
deadly earnest. I’m not just fool- 
ing.” 



JACKPOT 



J27 



“I know you aren’t, Doc.” 

I went back to where the others 
were clustered just a short dis- 
tance from the building. I ex- 
plained \yhat was up. 

“We’ll have to spread out and 
charge him,” Hutch decided. “He 
may get one or two of us, but we 
can pick him off.” 

“He’ll simply close the p)ort,” I 
said. “He can starve us out. In a 
pinch, he could try to take the 
ship up. If he ever managed to get 
sober, he could probably do it.” 
“He’s crazy,” said Pancake. 
“Just plain drunken crazy.” 
“Sure he is,” I said, “and that 
makes him twice as deadly. He’s 
been brooding ’on this business 
for a long, long time. He built up 
a guilt complex that is three miles 
high. And worst of all, he’s got 
himself out on a limb and he 
can’t back down.” 

“We haven’t got much time,” 
said Frost. “We’ve got to think of 
something. A man can die of 
thirst. You can get awfully hun- 
gry in just a little while.” 

The three of them got to 
squabbling about what was best 
to do and I sat down on the sand 
and leaned back against one of 
the machines and tried to figure 
Doc. 

Doc was a failure as a medic; 
otherwise he’d not have tied up 
with us. More than likely, he had 
joined us as a gesture of defiance 
or despair — perhaps a bit of both. 

I2S 



And besides being a failure, he 
was an idealist. He was out of 
place with us, but there’d been 
nowhere else to go, nothing else 
to do. For years, it had eaten at 
him and his values got all warped 
and there’s no place better than 
deep space to get your values 
warped. 

He was crazy as a coot, of 
course, but a special kind of 
crazy. If it hadn’t been so ghastly, 
you might have called it glorious 
crazy. 

You wanted to laugh him off or 
brush him to one side, for that 
was the kind of jerk he was, but 
he wouldn’t laugh or brush. 

I don’t know if I heard a sound 
— a footstep, maybe — or if I just 
sensed another presence, but all 
at once I knew we’d been joined 
by someone. 

I half got up and swung around 
toward the building and there, 
just outside the entrance, stood 
what looked at first to be a kind 
of moth made up in human size. 

I don’t mean it was an insect — 
it just had the look of one. Its 
face was muffled up in a cloak it 
wore and it was not a human face 
and there was a ruff rising from 
its head like those crests you see 
on the helmets in the ancient 
plays. 

HEN I saw that the cloak was 
not a cloak at all, but a part 
of the creature and it looked like 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



it might be folded wings, but it 
wasn’t wings. 

“Gentlemen,” I said as quietly 
as I could, “we have a visitor.” 

I walked toward the creature 
soft and easy and alert, not want- 
ing to frighten it, but all set to 
take evasive action if it tried to 
put the finger on me. 

“Be ready. Hutch,” I said. 

“I’m covering you,” Hutch as- 
sured me and it was a comfort to 
know that he was there. A man 
couldn’t get into too much trouble 
with Hutch backing him. 

I stopped about six feet from 
the creature and he didn’t look as 
bad close up as he did at a dis- 
tance. His eyes seemed to be kind 
and gentle and his funny face, 
alien as it was, had a sort of 
peacefulness about it. But even 
so, you can’t always tell with 
aliens. 

We stood there looking at one 
another. The both of us under- 
stood there was no use of talking. 
We just stood and sized one an- 
other up. 

Then the creature took a cou- 
ple of steps and reached out a 
hand that was more like a claw 
than hand. He took my hand in 
his and tugged for me to come. 

There were just two things to 
do — either snatch my hand away 
or go. 

I went. 

I didn’t stop to get it figured 
out, but there were several fac- 



tors that helped make up my 
mind. First off, the creature 
seemed to be friendly and intel- 
ligent. And Hutch and all the 
others were there, just behind me. 
And over and above all, you 
don’t get too far with aliens if 
you act stand-offish. 

So I went. 

We walked into the silo and 
behind me I heard the tramping 
feet of the others and it was a 
sound that was good to hear. 

I didn’t waste any time won- 
dering where the creature might 
have come from. I admitted to 
myself, as I walked along, that I 
had been half-expecting some- 
thing just like this. The silo was 
so big that it could hold many 
things, even people or creatures, 
we could not know about. After 
all, we’d explored only one small 
corner of the first floor of it. The 
creature, I figured, must have 
come from somewhere on the up- 
per floors as soon as he learned 
about us. It might have taken 
quite a while, one way or another, 
for the news to reach him. 

He led me up three ramps to 
the fourth floor of the building 
and went down a corridor for a 
little way, then went into a room. 

It was not a large room. It held 
just one machine, but this one 
was a double model; it had two 
bucket seats and two helmets. 
There was another creature in 
the room. 



The first one led me over to the 
machine and motioned for me to 
take one of the seats. 

¥ STOOD there for a while, 
watching Hutch and Pancake 
and Frost and all the others 
crowd into the place and line up 
against the wall. 

Frost said: “A couple of you 
boys better stay outside and 
watch the corridor.” 

Hutch asked me: “You going 
to sit down in that contraption, 
Captain?” 

“Why not?” I said. “They seem 
to be all right. There’s more of us 
than them. They don’t mean us 
any harm.” 

“It’s taking a chance,” said 
Hutch. 

“Since when have we stopped 
taking chances?” 

The creature I had rret outside 
had sat down in one of the seats, 
so I made a few adjustments in 
the other. While I was doing this, 
the second creature went to a file 
and got out two sticks, but these 
sticks were transparent instead of 
being black. He lifted off the hel- 
mets and inserted the two sticks. 
Then he fitted one of the helmets 
on his fellow-creature’s head and 
held out the other to me. 

I sat down and let him put it 
on and suddenly I was squatting 
on the floor across a sort of big 
coffee-table from the gent I had 
met outside. 




“Now we can talk,” said the 
creature, “which we couldn’t do 
before.” 

I wasn’t scared or flustered. It 
seemed just as natural as if it had 
been Hutch across the table^ 
“There will be a record made 
of everything we say,” said the 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




creature. “When we are finished, 
you will get one copy and I will 
get the other for our files. You 
might call it a pact or a contract 
or whatever term seems to be 
most applicable.” 

“I’m not much at contracts,” I 
told him. “There’s too much legal 



flypaper tied up with most of 
them.” 

“An agreement, then,” the crea- 
ture suggested. “A gentlemen’s 
agreement.” 

“Good enough,” I said. 

Agreements are convenient 
things. You can break them any 



JACKPOT 



131 




time you want. Especially gentle- 
men’s agreements. 

“I suppose you have figured 
out what this place is,” he said. 

“Well, not for sure,” I replied. 
“Library is the closest that we 
have come.” 

“It’s a university, a galactic 
university. We specialize in ex- 
tension or home-study courses.” 
I’m afraid I gulped a bit. “Why, 
that’s just fine.” 

“Our courses are open to all 
who wish to take them. There are 
no entrance fees and there is no 
tuition. Neither are there any 
scholastic requirements for enroll- 
ment. You yourself can see how 
difficult it would be to set up such 
requirements in a galaxy where 
there are many races of varying 
viewpoints and abilities.” 

“You bet I can. 

“The courses are free to all 
who can make use of them,” he 
said. “We do expect, of course, 
that they make proper use of 
them and that they display some 
diligence in study.” 

“You mean anyone at all can 
enroll?” I asked. “And it don’t 
cost anything?” 

A fter the first disappoint- 
ment, I was beginning to see 
the possibilities. With bona fide 
university educations for the tak- 
ing, it would be possible to set up 
one of the sweetest rackets that 
anyone could ask for. 

132 



“There’s one restriction,” the 
creature explained. “We cannot, 
obviously, concern ourselves with 
individuals. The paperwork would 
get completely out of hand. We 
enroll cultures. You, as a repre- 
sentative of your culture — what 
is it you call yourselves?” 

“The human race, originally of 
the planet Earth, now covering 
some half million cubic light- 
years. I’d have to see your 
chart . .” 

“That’s not necessary at the 
moment. We would be quite 
happy to accept your application 
for the entrance of the human 
race.” 

It took the wind out of me for 
a minute. I wasn’t any represen- 
tative of the human race. And if 
I could be, I wouldn’t. This was 
my deal, not the human race’s. 
But I couldn’t let him know that, 
of course. He wouldn’t have done 
business with me. 

“Now not so fast,” I pleaded. 
“There’s a question or two I’d like 
to have you answer. What kind of 
courses do you offer? What kind 
of electives do you have?” 

“First there is the basic course,” 
the creature said. “It is more or 
less a familiarization course, a 
sort of orientation. It includes 
those subjects which we believe 
can be of the most use to the race 
in question. It is, quite naturally, 
tailored specifically for each stu- 
dent culture. After that, there is 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a wide field of electives, hundreds 
of thousands of them.” 

“How about final exams and 
tests and things like that?” I 
wanted to know. 

“Oh, surely,” said the creature. 
“Such tests are conducted every 
— tell me about your time sys- 
tem.” 

I told him the best I could and 
he seemed to understand. 

“I d say,” he finally said, “that 
about every thousand years of 
your time would come fairly 
close. It is a long-range program 
and to conduct tests any oftener 
would put some strain upon our 
resources and might be of little 
value.” 

That decided me. What hap- 
pened a thousand years from now 
was no concern of mine. 

I asked a few more questions 
to throw him off the track — just 
in case he might have been suspi- 
cious— about the history of the 
university and such. 

I still can’t believe it. It’s hard 
to conceive of any race working 
a million years to set up a univer- 
sity aimed at the eventual educa- 
tion of an entire galaxy, traveling 
to all the planets to assemble 
data, compiling the records of 
countless cultures, correlating and 
classifying and sorting out that 
mass of information to set up the 
study courses. 

It was just too big for a man to 
grasp. 



OR A while, he had me reeling 
^ on the ropes and faintly star- 
ry-eyed about the whole affair. 
But then I managed to snap back 
to normal. 

“All right. Professor,” I said, 
“you can sign us up. What am I 
supposed to do?” 

“Not a thing,” he said. “The re- 
cording of our discussion will sup- 
ply the data. We’ll outline the 
course of basic study and you 
then may take such electives as 
you wish.” 

“If we can’t haul it all in one 
trip, we can come back again?” I 
asked. 

“Oh, definitely. I anticipate you 
may wish to send a fleet to carry 
all you need. We’ll supply suffi- 
cient machines and as many cop>- 
ies of the study recordings as you 
think you will need.” 

“It’ll take a lot,” I said bluntly, 
figuring I’d start high and haggle 
my way down. “An awful lot.” 

“I am aware of that,” he told 
me. “Education for an entire cul- 
ture is no simple matter. But we 
are geared for it.” 

So there we had it — all legal 
and airtight. We could get any- 
thing we wanted and as much as 
we wanted and we’d have a right 
to it. No one could say we stole it. 
Not even Doc could say that. 

The creature explained to me 
the system of notation they used 
on the recording cylinders and 
how the courses would be boxed 



JACKPOT 



133 



and numbered so they could be 
used in context. He promised to 
supply me with recordings of the 
electives so I could pick out what 
we wanted. 

He was real happy about find- 
ing another customer and he 
proudly told me of all the others 
that they had and he held forth 
at length on the satisfaction that 
an educator feels at the opportu- 
nity to pass on the torch of 
knowledge. 

He had me feeling like a heel. 

Then we were through and I 
was sitting in the seat again and 
the second creature was taking 
the helmet off my head. 

I got up and the first creature 
rose to his feet and faced me. We 
couldn’t talk any more than we 
could to start with. It was a weird 
feeling, to face a being you’ve just 
made a deal with and not be able 
to say a single word that he can 
understand. 

But he held out both his hands 
and I took them in mine and he 
gave my hands a friendly squeeze. 

“Why don’t you go ahead and 
kiss him?” asked Hutch. “Me and 
the boys will look the other way.” 

Ordinarily, I’d have slugged 
Hutch for a crack like that, but I 
didn’t even get sore. 

The second creature took the 
two sticks out of the machine and 
handed one to me. They’d gone 
in transparent, but they came out 
black. 

134 



“Let’s get out of here,” I said. 

We got out as fast as we could 
and still keep our dignity — if you 
could call it that. 

^ UTSIDE the silo, I got Hutch 
and Pancake and Frost to- 
gether and told them what had 
happened. 

“We got the Universe by the 
tail,” I said, “with a downhill 
pull.” 

“What about "Doc?” asked 
Frost. 

“Don’t you see? It’s just the 
kind of deal that would appeal to 
him. We can let on we’re noble 
and big-hearted and acting in 
good faith. All I need to do is get 
close enough to grab him.” 

“He won’t even listen to you,” 
said Pancake. “He won’t believe 
a word you say.” 

“You guys stay right here,” I 
said. “I’ll handle Doc.” 

I walked back across the stretch 
of ground between the building 
and the ship. There was no sign 
of Doc. I was all set to holler for 
him, then thought better of it. I 
took a chance and started up the 
ladder. I reached the port and 
there was still no sign of him. 

I moved warily into the ship. I 
thought I knew what had become 
of him, but there was no need to 
take more chances than I had to. 

I found him in his chair in the 
dispensary. He was stiffer than a 
goat. The gun lay on the floor. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



There were two empty bottles be- 
side the chair. 

I stood and looked at him and 
knew what had happened. After 
I had left, he had got to thinking 
about the situation and had run 
into the problem of how he’d 
climb down off that limb and he 
had solved it the way he’d solved 
most of his problems all his life. 

I got a blanket and covered 
him. Then I rummaged around 
and found another bottle. I un- 
corked it and put it beside the 
chair, where he could reach it 
easy. Then I picked up the gun 
and went to call the others in. 

I lay in bed that night and 
thought about it and it was beau- 
tiful. 

There were so many angles that 
a man didn’t know quite where 
to start. 

There was the university racket 
which, queerly enough, was en- 
tirely legitimate, except that the 
professor out in the silo never 
meant it to be sold. 

And there was the quickie va- 
cation deal, offering a year or two 
on an alien planet in six hours of 
actual time. All we’d need to do 
was pick a number of electives in 
geography or social science or 
whatever they might call it. 

There could be an information 
bureau or a research agency, 
charging fancy prices to run 
down facts on any and all sub- 
jects. 



Without a doubt, there’d be 
some on-the-spot historical record- 
ings and with those in hand, we 
could retail adventure, perfectly 
safe adventure, to the stay-at- 
homes who might hanker for it. 

I thought about that and a lot 
of other things which were not 
quite so sure, but at least prob- 
able and worth investigating, and 
I thought, too, about how the pro- 
fessors had finally arrived at what 
seemed to me a sure-fire effective 
medium for education. 

You wanted to know about a 
thing, so you up and lived it; you 
learned it on the ground. You 
didn’t read about it or bear about 
it or even see it in plain three- 
dimension — you experienced it. 
You walked the soil of the planet 
you wanted to know about; you 
lived with the beings that you 
wished to study; you saw as an 
eyewitness, and perhaps as a par- 
ticipant, the history that you 
sought to learn. 

A nd it could be used in other 
ways as well. You could learn 
to build anything, even a space- 
ship, by actually building one. 
You could learn how an alien 
machine might operate by putting 
it together, step by simple step. 
There was no field of knowledge 
in which it would not work — and 
work far better than standard 
educational methods. 

Right then and there, I made

135 



up my mind we’d not release a 
single stick until one of us had 
previewed it. No telling what a 
man might find in one of them 
that could be put to practical use. 

I fell asleep dreaming about 
chemical miracles and new engi- 
neering principles, of better busi- 
ness methods and new philo- 
sophic concepts. And I even 
figured out how a man could make 
a mint of money out of a philo- 
sophic concept. 

We were on top of the Uni- 
verse for sure. We’d set up a cor- 
poration with more angles than 
you could shake a stick at. We 
would be big time. In a thousand 
years or so, of course, there’d be 
a reckoning, but none of us would 
be around to take part in it. 

¥^OC sobered up by morning 
and I had Frost heave him in 
the brig. He wasn’t dangerous any 
longer, but I figured that a spell 
in pokey might do him a world of 
good. After a while, I intended to 
talk to him, but right at the mo- 
ment I was much too busy to be 
bothered with him. 

I went over to the silo with 
Hutch and Pancake and had an- 
other session with the professor 
on the double-seat machine and 
picked out a batch of electives 
and settled various matters. 

Other professors began supply- 
ing us with the courses, all boxed 
and labeled, and we set the crew 

136 



and the engine gang to work haul- 
ing them and the machines aboard 
and stowing them away. 

Hutch and I stood outside the 
silo and watched the work go on. 

“I never thought,” said Hutch, 
“that we’d hit the jackpot this 
way. To be downright honest 
with you, I never thought we’d hit 
it. I always thought we’d just go 
on looking. It goes to show how 
wrong a man can be.” 

“Those professors are soft in 
the head,” I said. “They never 
asked me any questions. I can 
think of a lot they could have 
asked that I couldn’t answer.” 
“They’re honest and think 
everyone’s the same. That’s what 
comes of getting so wrapped up 
in something you have time for 
nothing else.” 

And that was true enough. The 
professor race has been busy for 
a million years doing a job it took 
a million years to do — and an- 
other million and a million after 
that — and that never would be 
finished. 

“I can’t figure why they did it,” 
I said. “There’s no profit in it.” 
“Not for them,” said Hutch, 
“but there is for us. I tell you. 
Captain, it takes brains to work 
out the angles.” 

I told him what I had figured 
out about previewing everything 
before we gave it out, so we 
would be sure we let nothing slip 
away from us. 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



riUTCH was impressed. “I’ll 
say this for you, Captain — 
you don’t miss a bet. And that’s 
the way it should be. We might as 
well milk this deal for every cent 
it’s worth.” 

“I think we should be methodi- 
cal about this previewing busi- 
ness,” I said. “We should start at 
the beginning and go straight 
through to the end.” 

Hutch said he thought so, too. 
“But it will take a lot of time,” 
he warned me. 

“That’s why we should start 
right now. The orientation course 
is on board already and we could 
start with that. All we’d have to 
do is set up a machine and Pan- 
cake could help you with it.” 
“Help me!” yelled Hutch. “Who 
said anything about me doing it? 
I ain’t cut out for that stuff. You 
know yourself I never do any 
reading — ” 

“It isn’t reading. You just live 
it. You’ll be having fun while 
we’re out here slaving.” 

“I won’t do it.” 

“Now look,” I said, “let’s use a 
little sense. I should be out here 
at the silo seeing everything goes 
all right and close at hand so I 
can hold a powwow with the pro- 
fessor if there’s any need of it. We 
need Frost to superintend the 
loading. And Doc is in the clink. 
‘That leaves you and Pancake. I 
can’t trust Pancake with that pre- 
viewing job. He’s too scatter- 



brained. He’d let a fortune glide 
right past him without recogniz- 
ing it. Now you’re a fast man with 
a buck and the way I see it — ” 

“Since you put it that way,” 
said Hutch, all puffed up, “I sup- 
pose I am the one who should be 
doing it.” 

That evening, we were all dog- 
tired, but we felt fine. We had 
made a good start with the load- 
ing and in a few more days would 
be heading home. 

Hutch seemed to be preoccu- 
pied at supper. He fiddled with 
his food. He didn’t talk at all and 
he seemed like a man with some- 
thing on his mind. 

As soon as I could, I cornered 
him. 

“How’s it going, Hutch?” 

“Okay,” he said. “Just a lot of 
gab. Explaining what it’s all 
about. Gab.” 

“Like what?” 

“Some of it is hard to tell. 
Take a lot of explaining I haven’t 
got the words for. Maybe one of 
these days you’ll find the time to 
run through it yourself.” 

“You can bet your life I will,” 
I said, somewhat sore at him. 

“There’s nothing worth a dime 
in it so far,” said Hutch. 

I believed him on that score. 
Hutch could spot a dollar twenty 
miles away. 

I went down to the brig to see 
Doc. He was sober. Also unre- 
pentant. 



JACKPOT 



137 



“You outreached yourself this 
time,” he said. “That stuff isn’t 
yours to sell. There’s knowledge 
in that building that belongs to 
the Galaxy — for free.” 

¥ EXPLAINED to him what had 
^ happened, how we’d found the 
silo was a university and how we 
were taking the courses on board 
for the human race after signing 
up for them all regular and pro- 
per. I tried to make it sound as if 
we were being big, but Doc 
wouldn’t buy a word of it. 

“You wouldn’t give your dying 
grandma a drink of water unless 
she paid you in advance,” he said. 
“Don’t give me any of that guff 
about service to humanity.” 

So I left him to stew in the 
brig a while and went up to my 
cabin. I was sore at Hutch and 
all burned up at Doc and my tail 
was dragging. I fell asleep in no 
time. 

The work went on for several 
days and we were almost finished. 

I felt pretty good about it. Af- 
ter supper, I climbed down the 
ladder and sat on the ground be- 
side the ship and looked across at 
the silo. It still looked big and 
awesome, but not as big as that 
first day — because now it had 
lost some of its strangeness and 
even the purpiose of it had lost 
some of its strangeness, too. 

Just as soon as we got back to 
civilization, I promised myself, 

138 



we’d seal the deal as tight as pos- 
sible. Probably we couldn’t le- 
gally claim the planet because the 
professors were intelligent and 
you can’t claim a planet that has 
intelligence, but there were plenty 
of other ways we could get our 
hooks into it for keeps. 

I sat there and wondered why 
no one came down to sit with me, 
but no one did, so finally I clam- 
bered up the ladder. 

I went down to the brig to have 
a word with Doc. He still was un- 
repentant, but he didn’t seem too 
hostile. 

“You know. Captain,” he said, 
“there have been times when I’ve 
not seen eye to eye with you, but 
despite that I’ve respected you 
and sometimes even liked you;” 
“What are you getting at?” I 
asked him. “You can’t soft-talk 
yourself out of the spot you’re in.” 
“There’s something going on 
and maybe I should tell you. You 
are a forthright rascal. You don’t 
even take the trouble to deny you 
are. You have no scruples and 
probably no morals, and that’s all 
right, because you don’t pretend 
to have. You are — ” 

“Spit it out! If you don’t tell me 
what is going on. I’ll come in 
there and wring it out of you.” 
“Hutch has been down here 
several times,” said Doc, “inviting 
me to come up and listen to one 
of those recordings he is fooling 
with. Said it was right down my 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



alley. Said I’d not be sorry. But 
there was something wrong about 
it. Something sneaky.” He stared 
round-eyed through the bars at 
me. “You know, Captain, Hutch 
was never sneaky.” 

“Well, go on!” 

“Hutch has found out some- 
thing, Captain. If I were you, I’d 
be finding out myself.” 

I didn’t even wait to answer 
him. I remembered how Hutch 
had been acting, fiddling with his 
food and preoccupied, not talk- 
ing very much. And come to think 
of it, some of the others had been 
acting strangely, too. I’d just been 
too busy to give it much atten- 
tion. 

T3 UNNING up the catwalks, 
I cussed with every step 
I took. A captain of a ship should 
never get so busy that he loses 
touch — he has to stay in touch 
all the blessed time. It had all 
come of being in a hurry, of want- 
ing to get loaded up and out of 
there before something happened. 

And now something had hap- 
pened. No one had come down to 
sit with me. There’d not been a 
dozen words spoken at the supper 
table. Everything felt deadly 
wrong. 

Pancake and Hutch had rigged 
up the chart room for the pre- 
viewing chore and I busted into 
it and slammed the door and 
stood with my back against it. 



Not only Hutch was there, but 
Pancake and Frost as well and, in 
the machine’s bucket seat, a man 
I recognized as one of the engine 
gang. 

I stood for a moment without 
saying anything, and the three of 
them stared back at me. The man 
with the helmet on his head didn’t 
notice — he wasn’t even there. 

“All right. Hutch,” I said, “come 
clean. What is this all about? 
Why is that man previewing? I 
thought just you and — ” 

“Captain,” said Frost, “we were 
about to tell you.” 

“You shut up! I am asking 
Hutch.” 

“Frost is right,” said Hutch. 
“We were all set to tell you. But 
you were so busy and it came a 
little hard . .” 

“What is hard about it?” 
“Well, you had your heart all 
set to make yourself a fortune. 
We were trying to find a way to 
break it to you gentle.” 

I left the door and walked over 
to him. 

“I don’t know what you’re talk- 
ing about,” I said, “but we still 
make ourselves a killing. There 
never was a time of day or night, 
Hutch, that I couldn’t beat your 
head in and if you don’t want me 
to start, you better talk real fast.” 
“We’ll make no killing. Cap- 
tain,” Frost said quietly. “We’re 
taking this stuff back and we’ll 
turn it over to the authorities.”

“All of you are huts!” I roared. 
“For years, we’ve slaved and 
sweated, hunting for the jackpot. 
And now that we have it in our 
mitts, now that we can walk bare- 
footed through a pile of thousand- 
dollar bills, you are going chicken 
on me. What’s—” 

“It’s not right for us to do it, 
sir,” said Pancake. 

And that “sir” scared me more 
than anything that had happened 
so far. Pancake had never called 
me that before. 

T LOOKED from one to the 
■*- other of them and what I saw 
in their faces chilled me to the 
bone. Every single one of them 
thought just the same as Pancake. 

“That orientation course!” I 
shouted. 

Hutch nodded. “It explained 
about honesty and honor.” 

“What do you scamps know 
about honesty and honor?” I 
raged. “There ain’t a one of you 
that ever drew an honest breath.” 

“We never knew about it be- 
fore,” said Pancake, “but we know 
about it now.” 

“It’s just propaganda! It’s just 
a dirty trick the professors played 
on us!” 

And it was a dirty trick. Al- 
though you have to admit the 
professors knew their onions. I 
don’t know if they figured us hu- 
mans for a race of heels or if the 
orientation course was just nor-

mal routine. But no wonder they 
hadn’t questioned me. No wonder 
they’d made no investigation be- 
fore handing us their knowledge. 
They had us stopped before we 
could even make a move. 

“We felt that since we had 
learned about honesty,” said 
Frost, “it was only right the rest 
of the crew should know. It’s an 
awful kind of life we’ve been liv- 
ing, Captain.” 

“So,” said Hutch, “we been 
bringing in the men, one by one, 
and orienting them. We figured it 
was the least that we could do. 
This man is about the last of 
them.” 

“A missionary,” I said to Hutch. 
“So that is what you are. Remem- 
ber what you told me one night? 
You said you wouldn’t be a mis- 
sionary no matter what they paid 
you.” 

“There’s no need of that,” Frost 
replied coldly. “You can’t shame 
us and you can’t bully us. We 
know we are right.” 

“But the money! What about 
the corporation? We had it all 
planned out!” 

Frost said: “You might as well 
forget it. Captain. When you take 
the course — ” 

“I’m not taking any course.” 
My voice must have been as 
deadly as I felt, for not a one of 
them made a move toward me. 
“If any of you mealy-mouthed 
missionaries feel an urge to make 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



me, you can start trying right 
now.” 

They still didn’t move. I had 
them bluffed. But there was no 
point in arguing with them. There 
was nothing I could do against 
that stone wall of honesty and 
honor. 

I turned my back on them and 
walked to the door. At the door, I 
stopped. I said to Frost: “You 
better turn Doc loose and give 
him the cure. Tell him it’s all 
right with me. He has it coming 
to him. It will serve him right.” 

Then I shut the door behind 
me and went up the catwalk to 
my cabin. I locked the door, a 
thing I’d never done before. 

I sat down on the edge of the 
bunk and stared at the wall and 
thought. 

^ I ^ HERE was just one thing 
they had forgotten. This was 
my ship, not theirs. They were 
just the crew and their papers 
had run out long ago and never 
been renewed. 

I got down on my hands and 
knees and hauled out the tin box 
I kept the papers in. I went 
through it systematically and 
sorted out the papers that I 
needed — the title to the ship and 
the registry and the last papers 
they had signed. 

I laid the papers on the bunk 
and shoved the box out of the 
way and sat down again. 



I picked up the papers and 
shuffled them from one hand to 
the other. 

I could throw them off the ship 
any time I wished. I could take 
off without them and there was 
nothing, absolutely nothing, they 
could do about it. 

And what was more, I could 
get away with it. It was legal, of 
course, but it was a rotten thing 
to do. Now that they were honest 
men and honorable, though, 
they’d bow to the legality and let 
me get away with it. And in such 
a case, they had no one but them- 
selves to thank. 

I sat there for a long time 
thinking, but my thoughts went 
round and round and mostly had 
to do with things out of the past 
— how Pancake had gotten tan- 
gled up in the nettle patch out in 
the Coonskin System and how 
Doc had fallen in love with (of 
all things) a tri-sexual being that 
time we touched at Siro and how 
Hutch had cornered the liquor 
supply at Munko, then lost it in 
a game that was akin to craps ex- 
cept the dice were queer little 
living entities that you had no 
control of, which made it tough 
on Hutch. 

A rap came at the door. 

It was Doc. 

“You all full of honesty?” I 
asked him. 

He shuddered. “Not me. I 
turned down the offer.”

“It’s the same kind of swill you 
were preaching at me just a cou- 
ple of days ago.” 

“Can’t you see,” asked Doc, 
“what it would do the human 
race?” 

“Sure. It’ll make them honor- 
able and honest. No one will ever 
cheat or steal again and it will 
be cozy . .” 

•‘They’ll die of complicated 
boredom,” said Doc. “Life will be- 
come a sort of cross between a 
Boy Scout jamboree and a ladies 
sewing circle. There’ll be no loud 
and unseemly argument and 
they’ll be polite and proper to the 
point of stupefaction.” 

“So you have changed your 
mind.” 

“Not really. Captain. But this is 
the wrong way to go about it. 
Whatever progress the race has 
ever made has been achieved by 
the due process of social evolu- 
tion. In any human advance, the 
villains and the rascals are as im- 
portant as the forward-looking 
idealist. They are Man’s con- 
sciences and Man can’t get along 
without them.” 

“If I were you. Doc,” I said, “I 
wouldn’t worry so much about 
the human race. It’s a pretty big 
thing and it can take a lot of 
bumps. Even an overdose of hon- 
esty won’t hurt it permanently.” 

Actually, I didn’t give a damn. 
I had other things on my mind 
right then.

D oc crossed the room and sat 
down on the bunk beside 
me. He leaned over and tapped 
the papers I still held in my hand. 

“You got it all doped out,” he 
said. 

I nodded bleakly. “Yeah.” 

“I thought you would.” 

I shot a quick glance at him. 
“You were way ahead of me. 
That’s why you switched over.” 
Doc shook his head emphati- 
cally. “No. Please believe me. 
Captain, I feel as bad as you do.” 
“It won’t work either way.” I 
shuffled the papers. “They acted 
in good faith. They didn’t sign 
aboard, sure. But there was no 
reason that they should have. It 
was all understood. Share and 
share alike. And that’s the way 
it’s been for too long to repudiate 
it now. And we can’t keep on. 
Even if we agreed to dump the 
stuff right here and blast off and 
never think of it again, we’d not 
get rid of it. It would always be 
there. The past is dead. Doc. It’s 
spoiled. It’s smashed and it can’t 
be put back together.” 

I felt like bawling. It had been 
a long time since I had felt that 
full of grief. 

“They are different kind of 
men now,” I said. “They went and 
changed themselves and they’ll 
never be the same. Even if they 
could change back, it wouldn’t be 
the same.” 

Doc mocked me a little. “The 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



race will build a monument to 
you. Maybe actually on Earth it- 
self, with all the other famous hu- 
mans, for bringing back this stuff. 
They’d be just blind enough to do 
it.” 

I got up and paced the floor. “I 
don’t want any monument. I’m 
not bringing it in. I’m not having 
anything more to do with it.” 

I stood there, wishing we had 
never found the silo, for what had 
it done for me except to lose me 
the best crew and the best friends 
a man had ever had? 

“The ship is mine,” I said. 
“That is all I want. I’ll take the 
cargo to the nearest point and 
dump it there. Hutch and the rest 
of them can carry on from there, 
any way they can. They can have 
the honesty and honor. I’ll get an- 
other crew.” 

lY/f' AYBE, I thought, some day 
it would be almost the way 
it had been. Almost, but not quite. 

“We’ll go on hunting,” I said. 
“We’ll dream about the jackpot. 
We’ll do our best to find it. We’ll 
do anything to find it. We’ll break 
all the laws of God or Man to 
find it. But you know something. 
Doc?” 

“No, I don’t,” said Doc. 

“I hope we never find it. I don’t 
want to find another. I just want 
to go on hunting.” 

We stood there in the silence, 
listening to the fading echoes of 



those days we hunted for the 
jackpot. 

“Captain,” said Doc, “will you 
take me along?” 

I nodded. What was the differ- 
ence? He might just as well. 

“Captain, you remember those 
insect mounds on Suud?” 

“Of course. How could I forget 
them?” 

“You know, I’ve figured out a 
way we might break into them. 
Maybe we should try it. There 
should be a billion . .” 

I almost clobbered him. 

I’m glad now that I didn’t. 

Suud is where we’re headed. 

If Doc’s plan works out, we 
may hit that jackpot yet!

ADDRESS 



Looking For Us, Professor? 

"Hmm, yes. I was just cogitating upon the causes of GALAXY 
Science Fiction's phenomenal growth in popularity." 

"And that needs an explanation, Professor?" 

"From a socio-psychological viewpoint, most definitely. To 
what do you attribute the constant increase of interest?" 

"Well . let's try It this way. Professor. Suppose we ask the 
questions and you answer them." 

"So? A bit unusual, but go right ahead." 

"Do you think atomic doom is the only future for mankind?" 

"Not exactly, but the newspapers and the commentators—" 

"Of course. Well, we SHOW other possible futures. Do you 
believe we will be able to leave the Earth?" 

"Eventually, perhaps. But not in our lifetime." 

"We don't agree. Assuming you're right, though, isn't that all 
the more reason to want to know what we'll find on other 
planets. Professor?" 

"I think I see what you mean." 

"Can we achieve immortality?" 

"Ah. Hum. I've often wondered." 

"And travel to different eras in time?" 

"That would be exciting." 

"And you've been trying to discover why GALAXY is growing 
so popular? Every idea we've mentioned— and a lot more, be- 
sides— is treated dramatically and vividly in GALAXY! You really 
live them!" 

"Umm. How do I subscribe? After all, one shouldn't resist a 
trend, should one? Heh, heh!" 

"Just fill out the coupon— or make out your own order and 
send it in. The coupon's for your convenience, not ours. And now 
you'll be one of us!"
