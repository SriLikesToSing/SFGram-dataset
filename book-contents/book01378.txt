JOHN D. CLARK 

Foreword by Isaac Asimov 

“Read this book . you'll 
get a glimpse of the heroic 
excitement that seemed to 
make it reasonable to 
cuddle with death every 
waking moment — to say 
nothing of learning a heck 
of a lot about the way in 
which the business of sci- 
ence is really conducted." 

—Isaac Asimov 

Ignition! takes you inside 
the world of scientific 
research — a dangerous, 
exciting, sometimes very 



funny place indeed. John D. 
Clark, in charge of liquid 
propellant development at 
the Picatinny Arsenal for 
some 20 years, gives a first 
hand account of the dedi- 
cated men who survived 
explosions, smelly test 
tubes and one or two wars 
in order to put men on 
the moon. 

“The only clear story of one 
of the high moments of 
scientific research ... as 
good a job of reporting on a 
difficult field as I can re- 
member and far funnier at 
times than most .''— Lester 
del Rey $10.00

A MESSAGE FROM 
THE PUBLISHER 




ARNOLD E. ABRAMSON 



The United States Postal Service, 
now a semi-independent govern- 
mental corporation, recently in- 
creased postage rates by 1.4 billion 
dollars. 

And that's just the beginning. In 
its new budget, the Postal Service 
is asking for an additional 414 
million dollars ! 

Included is an increase in maga- 
zine and newspaper rates of 142% 
over the next five years — starting 
with a 30% increase this year. And 
with no reasonable prospect of any 
improvement in service to you. 

Despite the President's efforts to 
curb inflation by means of his 5.5% 
price and wage stabilization program, 
the Postal Service pursues this 
irresponsible plan for enormous 
rate increases — both immediate and 



future. Where is the logic in achieving 
success on some fronts while per- 
mitting the Postal Service to touch 
off roaring inflation in its own area? 

The contemplated postal increases, 
of course, would start an inevitable 
inflationary chain-reaction. Unable 
to absorb the higher costs, publishers 
would be obliged to pass on a portion 
of them to the public — and to ad- 
vertisers who in turn would have to 
pass on the increases to consumers 
of their goods. Directly or indirectly, 
it will be you who pays ! 

So we earnestly appeal to the 
President, to Congress and to you, 
the readers of Worlds of IF, to hold 
the line on postal-rate increases for 
at least three compelling reasons: 

1. To deter the general inflation 
threatening all of us — man , woman 
and child. 

2. To protect yourself, specifically, 
from inflationary pressures on ad- 
vertised products that you buy. 

3. To keep costs at a level per- 
mitting the free press of America 
to survive. 



We feel that our position is reason- 
able. We hope that you agree and 
will write your Congressman accord- 
ingly. It would please us to have a 
copy of your letter./

Is Earth disposable? Is

ZACH HUGHES 



I 

F OR the pleasure of Deepsoft 
the Keeper, the arching dome 
of her chamber was drawn to a 
thinness that admitted the dayglow. 
Yellowish outside light filtered 
through the membranous shell, 
purpled as the end of the sun circle 
lifted clouds of settled gases from 
dank, dark valleys and swirled 
them, noxious, heavy, to thicken 
the atmosphere. Shifting light at- 
tracted Deepsoft’s wide, pink eyes. 
Her heavy head lifted, nodded, 
jerked. Her long-fingered hands 
plucked at her coverlet. Her legs 
moved with an awkward lack of 
coordination. 

She made a wet sound of pleasure 
as winds aloft swirled thick masses 
and the dome glowed russet for a 
long, long period. The coverlet, 
made of the same material used 
in the construction of the dome, 
her sleeprack and the one chair 
That completed the furnishings of 
the chamber, bunched up and ex- 
posed the lower segment of her 
nude body. Her feet kicked aim- 
lessly, contacted the warm, soft, 
smooth wall. She flexed her legs 
and her body inched toward the 
edge of the rack. Her brain regis- 
tered the sensations: shifting light, 
smoothness on the soles of her 
feet, warmth, comfort, the flex 
of the coverlet under her fingers. 
She lifted her head on a wobbly 
neck, made the pleasure sounds. 
Time was meaningless. 



As her movements jostled her 
full stomach she burped wetly. A 
trickle ran from her full lips down 
her wide chin. Overhead the cool- 
ing masses of polar air caused con- 
densed moisture to fall in huge, 
fat drops to splatter on the dome. 
She clucked in delight. One long 
arm lifted, reached up as if to touch 
the splat-splat sounds. The light 
purpled, changing the shadows 
on her face. Her mood changed 
with the light, her face twisting. 
She made an explosive, complain- 
ing sound between her lips, her 
brain now registering discomfort. 
She needed. Her entire conscious- 
ness sent out the need and it was 
urgent. To avoid a messy task, 
Red Earth the Far Seer left his 
contemplation in the adjoining 
chamber to tend her. 

She was momentarily distracted 
from her need in an amusing ef- 
fort to stand, supported by Red 
Earth. Her legs were rubbery in 
spite of their firm tone. He held 
her and sent soothing things to her 
as he positioned her, held her 
there s listened, although his 
smooth knob of a head had no ears, 
as she completed the basic function 
and then tried to thrust one of her 
long-fingered, graceful hands be- 
tween her spread legs to feel the 
results. 

“Negative, negative,” he sent, 
slapping her hand lightly. He gave 
no pain. Giving pain was not in 
his nature. Had it been, the giving 
of it would have taught no lesson.

IF 




would have registered as a mean- 
ingless hurt having no connection 
with her innocent desire to ex- 
perience sensation by thrusting her 
hand into warmth. 

He cleaned her, feeling pleasure. 
She was rounded, full. Deepsoft. 
Her name. 

Had he not been roused from 
deep contemplation he would have 
stayed with her. 

He put her into the sleeprack, 
raised the protective siding. Night 
was near. The siding was of the 
smooth, transparent material of 
the dome and her hands felt it, 
flexed it. His own hands partook of 
pleasure as they caressed her, 
touched her white, rounded face. 
She made little pleasure sounds 
and reached for his hand with un- 
coordinated fingers. Her body 
moved. In contrast to the awkward- 
ness of her legs, her hands, her 
body made a sultry entity. Her 
mid-section lifted in inviting 
rhythm. Undecided, he examined 
her. His bulky, tough-skinned, 
bare knob did not move — he had 
no eyes to follow her length, no 
ears to hear her sounds. But his 
hands knew her long, firm legs, 
around and white. His hands 
caressed the firmness of her chest 
bulges. His senses traced her and 
measured her, and she stopped her 
movements as his hand teased, 
pressed. Her pink eyes moved with 
the shifting light patterns, but her 
body was frozen by sensation as 
his fingers pleased her. Then the 



momentary diversion was over and 
he was gone. Her eyes, wide" to 
gather the fading light, rolled 
erratically. 

OVEMENTS of great cloud 
masses in the end-of-the-sun- 
circle storms isolated the half- 
globe of the establishment of Red 
Earth the Far Seer. Stagnant gases 
made the dim distances seem vast 
as visibility was reduced. Light- 
sensing organs could not penetrate 
even as far to the north as the 
beginnings of the plains of glass. 
Only the senses of one such as Red 
Earth could detect the great river 
to the west, the high escarpment. 
Only Red Earth, in his establish- 
ment, could read the density of 
concentrated gases in the rift 
valley to the south, could penetrate 
the toxic denseness to see the 
motionless, heavy, oozing, mis- 
shapen vegetation on the valley 
floor. He saw all. He saw the shift 
of frequency, but Deepsoft’s in- 
ferior light-sensing organs saw the 
shift of color. 

Red Earth mused in his sanc- 
tuary. He measured idly, read the 
survival factor outside, found it 
at its usual end-of-the-sun-circle 
low. He could feel the shift of 
breathable air, mourn the stagnant 
poison buildup. He could feel the 
rise in temperature when a partic- 
ular denseness passed and the far 
sun sent its dying rays through the 
eternal haze; he could shiver inter- 
nally as the cooler polar masses

continued to move south and east. 

In his moment of idle musing he 
was not totally idle, for he searched 
his area of responsibility — it regis- 
tered normal. In scattered es- 
tablishments his people were shut 
away from the toxic storms, com- 
fortable with their carefully 
nurtured hoards of air-making 
Breathers. 

During his rounds he passed a 
casual greeting with his corespon- 
sor, Growing Tree, who did not 
pause, using only a small amount 
of energy to answer, as he tended 
a colony of Juicers at the Eastern 
Group Establishment. 

It was a moment of peace, if 
one could ignore the storm, the 
steadily lessening purity of the 
outside. It was thus and ever thus, 
and those who cried disaster when 
the storms blew had cried disaster 
before. 

A Power Giver soared high 
above the roiling clouds. Red 
Earth did not bother to establish 
contact or to ascertain identity. 
Power Givers were notoriously 
capricious. The flight, of course, 
was a shameful waste, but it was 
her own energies and substance 
the Power Giver was consuming. If 
one fulfilled one’s responsibilities, 
one’s actions were one’s own. The 
law covered even Power Givers. 

Yet he was vaguely disturbed by 
the waste and sought to forget, 
sending his attentions elsewhere 
to watch two young Healers at the 
mid-point of their learning. They 



were moving outside, using stored 
life for long periods, unable to 
utilize the air with its high toxic 
content, lungs holding, gills pump- 
ing out poisons. A Webber had 
escaped an establishment adjacent 
to the Eastern Group Establish- 
ment. Red Earth watched anxiously 
until the two youngsters, moving 
slowly but efficiently* not wasting 
life or force, herded the weakening 
Webber back to her kind in the 
enclosure. She would survive. 

N EAR the sea the process of 
food-making continued with 
pleasing steadiness. And — more 
exciting— a rare joining was in 
process. Without prying openly, 
Red Earth took satisfaction in the 
beautiful act. He lifted his feelings, 
to the toxic sky and, although 
there was no movement of his bare 
knob of a head, the effect was a nod 
of blessing and pleasure. A new 
life was being created. 

Mixed thoughts. Burdens. Plea- 
sures. Far Seers were accustomed 
to the burdens, having long since 
become resigned to responsibility. 
Pleasure was always welcome. 
Deepsoft. The burdens were not 
without their rewards. Deepsoft. 
That he himself would never know 
the crowning glory of the act — cre- 
ation — was unimportant. He felt no 
jealousy for the Healer engaged in 
joining, in the creation of life. It 
was the nature of things. In return, 
Healers and Power Givers held no 
envy for his ability to achieve the 



10 



IF 




pleasure of the act repeatedly, 
rather than the once— or at the 
most, twice — allowed the breeding 
classes. Nature simply gave him 
pleasure to compensate for his 
inability to create life — that she 
limited the fertile ones was beauti- 
fully logical. A dying planet was 
capable of supporting only so 
many — and that mysterious force 
which governed life allowed the 
Healers and the Power Givers one 
or two unions. During those, 
given the proper conditions, a new 
individual was created. 

In a way he could pity them. 
Deepsoft. They accepted his val- 
or without scorn but thought it 
fearful indulgence. The situation 
was amusing. .sort of. Power 
Givers could squander their pre- 
cious substance in meaningless 
soarings above the toxic clouds, 
seeking the simple joys of seeing 
without being hampered by clouds 
of dense gases and of breathing 
the thin wisps of pure air. Healers 
could ramble aimlessly. Each had 
his duty and if it were performed 
Red Earth and Growing Tree and 
others like them would see to the 
survival of all. The storms would 
pass. Noxious, heavy gases would 
settle into the valleys. Then even 
one so fragile as Deepsoft could 
bask in the glow of the filtered sun. 
Life would go on under the high 
douds of summer. The new joining 
on the eastern sea would produce — 
what? Hopefully, a Far Seer. 
Growing Tree’s logically antici- 



pated sun circles made a shorter 
and shorter picture. Would it be a 
Far Seer? Red Earth swept his 
area. Power Giver? Perhaps. Al- 
ways useful. Healer? Keeper? Ah, 
or — perhaps, just perhaps — the 
long awaited New One. 

That hope. Red Earth knew, was 
pure indulgence. Nature and nature 
alone could anticipate the need 
for a New One. He, in his limited 
wisdom, could not dare to imagine 
the needs. The need was dictated 
by the planet and by the elemental 
but mysterious necessity to seed 
and maintain life. Still, he allowed 
himself the indulgence. The New 
One. Would he eat the poisonous 
leafy things? Breathe the toxic 
vapors? Be warmed rather than 
damaged by the projectiles shot 
down through the perpetual haze 
by the sun? Only nature would 
know. Only that force could mea- 
sure and tell, but when it happened, 
as it inevitably would, then he, the 
Far Seer, he and all the rest — the 
Keepers, the Power Givers and the 
Healers — would be the Old Ones 
and life would continue even as the 
timeless movements of the planet 
brought new sun circles and the 
globe spun and swam and the giant 
flares of the sun — itself deadly and 
of unbelievable magnitude — tried 
their worst to return the planet to 
primordial emptiness. 

It was a comfort to believe. He 
still was not idle, despite his roam- 
ing thoughts. He recorded the 
rise of the planet’s satellite to the 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



11 




east, his sense bouncing there and 
back with a noticeable lag. He felt 
the solidity there, probed the depth 
of the craters. He tried — unsuc- 
cessfully, of course — to measure 
the breathable air there, to search 
for life-giving water and symbiotic 
Breathers. Failing, he sensed the 
sister worlds circling the sun, other 
planets unseen by any save the Far 
Seers — he probed, sensed, mea- 
sured, recorded. 

F OR his records, Red Earth 
sent his mind into the adjoining 
chamber, and the plucking fingers 
of the female, Deepsoft, became 
still. Into the vast storehouse of her 
brain went his observations: the rise 
of the satellite, the noted moment 
of the eastern joining, the positions 
of the sister worlds, the flare activ- 
ity of the sun. All was sent, record- 
ed, read back. Deepsoft lay very 
still. He was pleased. This far to 
go — he recorded a picture, a con- 
cept — in the sun circle and then 
would come the movement of air 
masses from the south and a time 
of beginning, a time of renewed 
hope. 

He had seen beginnings. He had 
never failed to anticipate each new 
one. Moreover, he had never lost 
hope even when his measurements 
and the readings of other Far Seers 
had given no hope. He had soared 
on the force of a Power Giver to 
hover over the vast waters of the 
south, had seen the sea of slime, 
had measured the hope that grew 



there in the natural breeding 
ground of the Breathers. Once — 
and he checked the store of knowl- 
edge in his Keeper's brain to study 
the concept of many sun circles 
past — he had actually measured 
an increase. The green slime of 
the next sun circle had been dense, 
but it had been long ago. Now there 
was again that terrible decline 
and the murky, heavy seas were 
vast, stretching far away from the 
tiny area in the south where cur- 
rents, winds — something — allowed 
a frighteningly small colony of 
Breathers to survive. To think end 
was defeat. Nature would not allow 
defeat. A world could not exist just 
to exist. A world was solidity, 
reality, and to comprehend the 
solidity and the reality a thinking 
brain was required. To envision a 
world without life was to ignore 
the basic purpose of all creation. 
No, the Breathers would adapt, 
would live atop the thick, heavy 
water. Life would go on. And 
some day the New One would be 
bom and then this dying, de- 
pleted planet would be squeezed 
of its last remaining resources and 
dynamic life would spring ex- 
uberantly upward. 

So thought Red Earth the Far 
Seer, slumped into his rack, huge 
chest moving only occasionally, 
red gills lying idle, since the pure 
air of the establishment offered no 
poison. Around him he sensed the 
small movements of the Breathers 
in their enclosures lining the walls

IF 




— eating, growing, breeding, using 
their small, strange bodies, half 
plant, half insect, to return to the 
air the life-giving particles which, 
in turn, found their way into Red 
Earth’s system. 

In the night no star shone. The 
satellite, unseen by light-sensing 
organs, climbed, moving in Red 
Earth’s senses. He did not stir until 
the satellite was at the zenith. When 
he moved his huge chest cavity 
swelled. He advanced to Deep- 
soft’s chamber on thin, short legs 
which extended from small hips 
below a flat belly and the huge, 
bulbous mass of his chest. His hide 
was thick, deep gray. His shoulders 
tapered upward, neckless, to his 
fat-tipped, cone-shaped bare head 
in which there were two orifices, 
the small, rounded feeding mouth 
and the hairy maw of his breather. 
On the side of the cone, low, next 
to his tapering shoulders, his gill 
slits opened, exhaled the last of his 
body poison, cleansing his lungs 
for the extended period of non- 
breathing. 

Deepsoft fed on the broth of 
life, the universal energy concen- 
trate distilled at the Eastern Group 
Establishment from the green slime 
source of the sea. Fed, she seized 
one of Red Earth’s fingers. He 
lowered the protective railing, 
joined her. She made sounds of 
pleasure and Red Earth blanked 
his thoughts, yielding to enjoy- 
ment as she cooed to' his givings of 
sensation. 



II 



AS CHANCE would have it, 
Rack the Healer was given 
his free time as the end-of-the-sun- 
circle storms moved down from the 
cool north. Growing Tree the Far 
Seer, as was his responsibility, 
assigned a Power Giver to trans- 
port Rack to his home area. The 
trip was made mostly in courteous 
silence, back to back. In prepara- 
tion Rack breathed deeply, voided 
his gill sacks of rejected vapors, 
closed off and used stored air until, 
high, high, the roiling, perpetual 
clouds a blanket of color below 
them, the Power Giver sent a 
thoughtful picture and Rack was 
allowed the rare pleasure of seek- 
ing nontoxic air. 

His huge chest heaved as his 
lungs breathed the thin but deli- 
cious mixture. His pleasure com- 
municated to the Power Giver and 
she laughed. 

Above them the sun was a deadly 
furnace, taking its toll. Rack’s 
large scales tingled, made an 
audible clattering noise as they 
rose to form small deflection areas. 
He knew that the hide of the 
Power Giver was being penetrated 
and he was momentarily saddened. 
Yet it was the nature of things. 
He would be the last to suggest to 
the freedom-loving Power Giver 
that she confine her flight to lower 
levels, where the thick atmosphere 
would shield her relatively fragile

hody from the deadly projectiles. 
Had he been born differently he 
would have done as she, for the 
exultation of being able to soar 
above the heavy gases, of being 
able to see and to smell the thin, 
pure air, was, he suspected, ample 
compensation. All life was even- 
tually ended, all life was relative 
and the price of pleasure was death. 
Still he had always found it sober- 
ing, in his rare transports inside the 
power field of one of these fragile, 
beautiful beings, to feel her de- 
pleting her very substance to obtain 
the energy needed to lock her 
unique abilities into the planet’s 
magnetic field and negate the pull 
from below, to rise without sound 
and soar far above the curve of the 
planet. 

Grateful, he bowed as she landed 
him near his establishment in the 
area of Red Earth the Far Seer. 
She was away with a joyous leap, 
relieved of his mass, fading quickly 
into the purpling air. She would 
need to seek rest and protection 
soon, for the yellow haze of toxicity 
was on the move. 

Inside his establishment he found 
things as he had left them at the 
beginning of the summer when he 
had gone to consummate his duty 
as a gatherer of the slime source, 
the pulpy plants growing on the 
floor of the shallow, inshore seas. 
He vented the accumulated poisons 
from his gills and breathed the 
clean, rich air. In his absence the 
Breathers had literally overloaded 



the dome with good air and it was 
sheer luxury to fall heavily into his 
rack and feel life being pumped into 
all his storage cells as he worked 
his huge chest like a bellows, 
breathing with sheer extravagance. 
He slept long and peacefully and 
awoke to take his fill of the broth. 
He stretched his long, agile legs, 
gaped, took in huge lungfuls of his 
rich air, made an audible sound of 
pleasure. 



H IS Breathers were healthy 
and producing happily. In his 
absence, of course, they had been 
regularly monitored by Red Earth 
the Far Seer, but Rack made the 
check anyhow. He found the feed- 
ing channels to the outside to be 
slightly corroded and cleaned them 
carefully. Finished with that task, 
he carefully cleaned the entry port 
and lock and was immediately 
bored when his housecleaning was 
done. 

Healers were, in general, a rest- 
less lot. As a youth Rack had 
caused considerable concern among 
his teachers by exhibiting a star- 
tling lack of direction, ambition. 
It had taken him long to outgrow 
the derogatory connotations of his 
name, a picture assigned to him by 
his mother because he had seemed 
content to spend all his time in the 
sleeprack, his mind in contact with 
any available Keeper, idly probing 
into the accumulated lore of the 
race. If he had been interested in 



14 



IF 




knowledge for the sake of learn- 
ing rather than for its entertain- 
ment value, his teachers had 
argued, his constant Keeper contact 
would have been justified. But he 
had been unimpressed by dry facts 
about the positions of the sister 
worlds, about survival factors, 
about the state of the native 
Breather population in the south- 
ern seas. Instead he had delved 
deeply into the mind banks of the 
oldest Keepers, wanting to hear the 
ancient lore regarding the origin of 
the race, asking stupid questions 
about the Old Ones. Once he had 
precipitated a crisis by tying up the 
minds of three Keepers at once 
with questions regarding reported 
findings of hard-material nuggets. 
Red Earth had discovered himself 
unable to record observations be- 
cause Rack had been monopolizing 
the Far Seer’s personal Keeper 
and, monitoring the contact, R.ed 
Earth had been chagrined to dis- 
cover the young Healer seriously 
interested in trying to gather 
enough information to make it 
possible for him to amass a per- 
sonal hoard of hard-material 
nuggets. 

To Red Earth, this was the foul- 
est waste of time. Hard-material 
nuggets were interesting and had 
often led to speculative, idle dis- 
cussions regarding the talents and 
abilities of the Old Ones. But the 
nugget stuff was totally useless. 

It was true that in the lands 
across the eastern sea hard- 



material nuggets were used as re- 
wards for services rendered gladly 
on the western continent by duty- 
driven citizens. But there were 
many strange things about those 
who inhabited the land beyond the 
sea. Since contact was rare, the 
trip across the vast waters being 
too long and strenuous for even the 
strongest Power Giver to make 
without suffering serious bodily 
damage. Red tarth didn’t care 
what the strange-minded citizens 
across the sea did. He simply did 
not want to see his area become in- 
volved in useless accumulations of 
valueless objects. He had repri- 
manded Rack the Healer severely, 
had recommended an educational 
period of gathering fresh slime- 
source plants from the chill waters 
of the far north — and had been 
pleased to find that Rack was 
matured when he returned. 

On only one other occasion had 
Rack incurred the displeasure of 
the Far Seers. In his first tour out 
of the Eastern Group Establish- 
ment, his work output had been 
seriously low on certain days. Red 
Earth had discovered that once 
again Rack had been asking ques- 
tions — using the storage mind of 
Growing Tree’s Keeper — about 
the Old Ones and in particular 
about the sunken city of Nar. 
Where Rack had found that 
particular bit of folk legend had 
been a puzzle to Red Earth, for 
all such useless bits of pseudoin- 
formation had long before been

15 




erased from the mind banks. Per- 
haps Rack had discovered it hidden 
in some Keeper’s mind where it 
had been filed out of context — and 
he had searched for the nonexistent 
sunken city to the detriment of his 
slime-source quota. 



D URING a long session Red 
Earth had tried to impress 
Rack with concepts of responsibi- 
lity, duty to the race, the sacred 
value of life and the need to bend 
every effort toward survival. Too 
long had the Far Seers been alone 
in the knowledge that life on the 
planet was precarious at best. 

At first Red Earth had thought 
that Rack’s inquiring mind was 
receptive. Rack had listened 
carefully to Red Earth’s summary 
of conditions, had agreed that one 
should not waste one’s energies in 
chasing the ghosts of the Old Ones 
but should, instead, send his 
intelligence searching for ways, 
however small, of improving con- 
ditions. 

“We are the results of — ” a pic- 
ture of sun circles so numerous that 
Rack’s Healer’s mind had not been 
capable of seeing the whole — “of 
evolution,” Red Earth had told 
him. “We, Healers, Keepers, Far 
Seers, Power Givers, are the logical 
results of life, the end results to 
this time. Nature, in her wisdom, 
has created in us the ability to 
cope with the problems of a dying 
planet, but she has not made the 



task an easy one. It is up to us, all 
of us, to help as we await her next 
move.” 

Such talk did indeed interest 
Rack. He was, after all, involved 
with life. But something in him 
continued to question. Was the 
ultimate pleasure service to one’s 
race? If so, why did every Far Seer 
have at least one Keeper? Not 
solely for the purpose of using the 
blank portion of the Keeper’s mind 
to store information. No. One 
could spy and see the Far Seers lost 
in their own pleasure, using the 
bodies of the Keepers. It was a 
pleasure alien to the nature of a 
Healer, of course, but it was plea- 
sure and it was indulged with an 
amusing regularity. 

To a Keeper curiosity was the 
source of pleasure and, as he ma- 
tured and grew older, Rack rea- 
soned — correctly, for he was never 
reprimanded when he did his duty 
and saved the satisfaction of his 
curiosity for his free time — that 
he was as much entitled to 
pleasure- as Red Earth was. So 
he filled his mind with the dim 
legends of the Old Ones. During 
his free periods he engaged in what 
the Far Seers looked on as Healer 
weakness, rambling on his long, 
mobile legs over the wide, empty 
space of the area. His ability to 
heal the damage he suffered from 
the hard projectiles and the toxic 
gases gave him mobility. His curi- 
osity and his wanderlust sent him 
to the thin frost of the far north, 



16 



IF 




to the steamy heat of the middle 
regions, to the waters of the west. 
He scaled mountains on the way, 
crossed a great river and climbed 
the broken face of the rift to the 
west of the river. In a box made of 
The Material, treasured, hoarded, 
were the results of his travels — two 
hard-material nuggets, one the size 
of his thumb ball, the other tiny. 
The large one was heavy in his 
palm, irregularly shaped. It could 
be scratched with a sharp, extra 
hard piece of The Material and it 
held an endless fascination for 
Rack. The smaller nugget was fast 
being eaten — even in the protective 
atmosphere of the establishment it 
accumulated brown waste on itself 
from time to time and, when 
cleaned, became smaller. 

But Red Earth was mistaken 
in thinking that Rack’s interest in 
the hard-material nuggets was to 
be judged simply as a desire to ac- 
cumulate objects possessing a 
certain rarity. To Rack the nuggets 
did not represent riches, as they 
did to citizens of the eastern lands. 
For Rack the nuggets held a dark 
mystery. 

R ACK felt constantly frus- 
- trated in his pursuit of knowl- 
edge regarding the Old Ones. There 
were the dim old legends, retained 
for their esthetic values, looked 
upon by the Far Seers as a part of 
the culture, saved for the pictur- 
esque beauty of the early thoughts 
of the first Healers. The thoughts 



of Rose the Healer had been pre- 
served from deep antiquity. Ah, 
how they rang, coming from the 
still, peaceful, childlike mind of an 
aging Keeper in the moist, steamy 
land beside the southern sea: 

And when the sun flared up, sear- 
ing the Old Ones, vast clouds of 
smoke and particles covered the 
sky. And the Old Ones died, forni- 
cating even in death, to give birth 
to the New Ones who had scales. 

“Negative, negative,” sent his 
teachers. 

“It is the thought of Rose the 
Healer,” Rack protested. 

“He speaks in symbols,” said the 
teachers, “for the process of evolu- 
tion moved on minute legs, crawl- 
ing forward through — ” a vast 
series of sun cycles — “to meet the 
slowly deteriorating conditions.” 
“And yet,” Rack argued, “Rose 
the Healer said that the sun flared 
up and killed the Old Ones 
suddenly.” 

“It is against logic,” said the 
teachers. “For have we not ob- 
served the sun for — ” another of 
those bewildering, long series of 
sun circle pictures — “and has it 
not been stable?” 

“How do you explain this, then?” 
And there were others which had 
tails and died birthing , and those 
with malformed features and 
stomachs without vital organs. 

“We know little,” they admitted, 
“for the Old Ones had no Keepers 
and all their store of knowledge, 
however insignificant, has been

lost. We can only presume that 
such a race, with none of the ad- 
vantages of civilization, with no 
kept records, existed on the plenty 
of a youthful planet, feeding and 
breathing the bounty of nature. 
There are also legends of other 
things, living things. And yet we 
find no proof. Surely, had the Old 
Ones built we would find remnants 
of their achievements, for is not 
The Material everlasting, resisting 
the acids of the air, the smoke of 
the burning earth of the southern 
lands?” 

“Could they have built of the 
hard materials?” 

“Negative, negative,” they sent. 
“You have traveled far. You have 
talked with many Healers who 
have nuggets — and yet, have you 
found the source of the hard ma- 
terial? Is it conceivable that there 
was once a life form on the planet 
capable of producing such a lifeless 
material? Could you possibly think 
that enough of the hard material 
could be amassed to construct 
even one establishment?” 

“But there is more than one 
type,” Rack said. “I have seen yel- 
low and white, dark and light. 
Some nuggets feed on themselves 
with dark waste while others, such 
as my large one, grow only a white, 
powdery waste when exposed to 
the yellow of the air.” 

“Another proof,” said the 
teachers, for the hard material 
was indeed fragile. “It feeds on 
itself. In — ” a short span of sun 



circles — “an establishment made 
of your hard material would be 
reduced.” 

“Perhaps,” Rack said, his heart 
beating with excitement, for he 
was being daring, “the hard ma- 
terial came from the bowels of the 
planet.” 

He received warning vibrations, 
for he was treading on dangerous 
ground. But he plunged on. “Per- 
haps the Old Ones penetrated the 
surface?” 

There was sadness in the answer, 
not anger. “It is conceivable. For 
the Old Ones died, did they not?” 

In truth, the Old Ones had died 
and left behind old legends and 
nothing more. 

In the final days , said Rose the 
Healer, the bodies of the Old Ones 
covered the Earth. 

So were the thoughts of Rose the 
Healer marred by impossible state- 
ments, making the total credence 
of his thoughts less than reliable, 
for no planet, however young and 
fruitful, could support so much 
life. 



I F ONLY, Rack thought, the Far 
Seers had not erased the old 
thoughts. If only they had been 
saved, not just the beautiful 
thoughts of Rose the Healer — and 
what a delightful concept was just 
his name, evoking a confused men- 
tal image of something delicate 
and bright and beautiful. But only 
Rose was whole in the minds of 



18 



IF 




the Keepers, along with an oc- 
casional misfiled tidbit which, when 
discovered, excited Rack wildly. 
He had found mention of a sunken 
city in the mind of a northern 
Keeper, a city in the eastern sea, 
huge, tall, towering to the sky. The 
reference had been filed — listing 
an unknown Healer as the source 
far back in antiquity— with the 
readings of air purity at the tops 
of various mountains. A Far Seer 
of the past had been speculating 
on the amount of The Material it 
would take to build a tower to 
project above the eternal toxicity, 
to reach into pure, thin air. And to 
the west, on the western sea, a 
group of Healers told of another 
city of the Old Ones — source of the 
information again unknown— a 
city that spread over what was now 
the plains of glass in Red Earth’s 
area beside the great river. There 
was even a name for the lost city, 
a name difficult to see, for it sug- 
gested no known image. 

“Could it be,” Rack had asked, 
upon hearing the name, “that the 
Old Ones truly knew civilization 
and constructed establishments?” 

“I think,” said a young, visionary 
Healer, “that question is answered 
by the picture of city.” 

He had not considered the 
possibility. City. A group of es- 
tablishments. Nothing existed 
on the whole continent to keep the 
picture in the language, yet it 
persisted, appearing in the mind of 
a northern Keeper, appearing again 



in the conversation of these Heal- 
ers, who had picked it up from 
older Healers, who had received 
it from some Keeper. On all the 
continent the Eastern Group Es- 
tablishment was the largest con- 
centration of The Material known 
and at peak production periods in 
the summer it was peopled by — the 
picture showed Power Givers in a 
grouping equal to the number of 
Rack’s left hand digits, a paired 
group of Far Seers, Healers swim- 
ming and diving, rock- weighted to 
sink into the thick water, all 
making a group comparable to all 
the digits on his hands and homy 
feet. 

The word, the picture, city , was 
Old One language. It had meaning. 
The name of the lost city on the 
huge river had no meaning, gave 
no image. It was an abstract thing, 
difficult to grasp. Another Old One 
word? 



I N his learning, the teachers 
had brushed past the Old Ones. 
Ancient man was primitive, living 
on the fat of the young planet. He 
was ignorant of the process of 
combining the products of the 
Juicers and the Webbers to form 
The Material, thus uncivilized. 
Ancient man had no recorded his- 
tory because of his lack of Keepers. 
Ancient man lacked the ability of 
the Power Givers and was thus 
immobile, confined to the distances 
he could cover with his feet and 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



19 




legs. In short, ancient man was 
joined to the race, the ultimate 
product of evolution, by a weak 
racial link and his achievements 
could not have been great. Ancient 
man, said the teachers, was prob- 
ably less intelligent than a Webber, 
but perhaps more intelligent than 
the front mind of a Keeper, who 
was unable to experience anything 
save basic sensations. To think that 
ancient man had built was folly. To 
attribute the hard materials to 
ancient man was incredible, for 
without tools of The Material, 
how could ancient man work the 
hard materials into any form? No. 
The hard materials, used by some 
mystics in the Healer ranks to 
form a mystery about ancient 
man, were of natural origin. Per- 
haps, since they were of such 
scarcity, they had fallen from the 
sky, for Far Seer probes indicated 
the presence of small bodies of solid 
material — other than the satellite, 
the sun and the sister planets and 
the far suns — which, to the most 
sensitive Far Seer appeared as 
tiny motes in a vast area. 

“Be content,” said the teachers, 
“with the wisdom of the race, 
for we are old. Be proud of our 
achievements, for we have con- 
quered a hostile world with only 
the weapons given us by nature, 
our minds. Contemplate the 
wonder of the invention of The 
Material by Dawn Eye the Far 
Seer. For is it not astounding that 
he could envision the domestica- 



tion of the vicious Webber with her 
sting of death? Is it not wonderful 
that he could milk the Fiery Juicer 
and, working at the risk of death, 
Fiery pain, disFigurement, combine 
the liquid Fire of the Juicer with the 
film of the Webber to protect us 
from the hostile elements? Wonder 
at the power of evolution, that it 
produces four distinct human 
forms to live in peace together, to 
work mind in mind to ensure the 
survival of life. For none could live 
alone. Be proud of your ability to 
heal, to spend extended periods 
in the vapors and the corrosive sea. 
Without them, without your ability 
to gather the slime source, what 
would be our nourishment? Be 
thankful for the Keepers, who store 
our knowledge and make us 
civilized. Praise the Power Givers 
who turn the vats that brew the 
broth, separating the deadly sub- 
stances from the life-giving ones.” 
Modestly the teachers did not 
praise themselves, the Far Seers, 
the accumulators of knowledge, 
the overseers of society, the back- 
bone of reason. The Far Seers, who 
were sterile, never seeing the beauty 
of a swirling purple storm, who 
watched over the lower life forms, 
measured the Breathers, milked the 
deadly Juicers, tamed the Fierce 
Webber. 

T RULY it was an arrangement 
to give wonder. It proved the 
wisdom of nature, the infallibility 
of her scheme to sustain life in an

IF 




atmosphere that ate a nugget of 
hard metal in less than a sun circle. 
Rack was not discontent. After he 
gained maturity he took pride in 
his ability to gather more slime 
source than any other young 
Healer. He gloried in his strength, 
his huge, billowing lungs which 
could store enough air to outlast 
the most severe end-of-circle 
storm, his wonderful healing cells 
which replaced themselves when 
damaged by hard projectiles or acid 
gases. There was much in his world 
to arouse his curiosity and he made 
his contributions to the knowledge 
of the race by feeding his observa- 
tions into the blank mind of a 
Keeper after his free-time explora- 
tion trips. He was recognized as an 
authority on the uninhabited vast- 
ness of the area of responsibility 
of Red Earth the Far Seer and was 
often consulted. He had come a 
long way from being the feckless 
young rack-lover who had caused 
frowns of concern among his 
teachers. In the prime of his physi- 
cal strength he was tall and had a 
chest thickness equal to half his 
height. His scales were healthy, 
showing no damage from all his 
wanderings. When he raised his 
protective eyefilms in the safety of 
his establishment his pupils glowed 
with a bright blue light and glit- 
tered with a love of life that was 
contagious. He was considerate, 
never venting his gills in the vicinity 
of an establishment, much less 
when in view of another being. He 



was generous with his time, always 
willing to use his strength to ven- 
ture out for an extended period in 
the service of anyone who needed 
such service. He asked no return 
save, at times, a period of conver- 
sation, lying on his rack, breathing 
his sweet, Breather-produced air, 
comparing knowledge with a Far 
Seer, gossiping with a fellow 
Healer, being polite and respectful 
to a friendly Power Giver. At such 
times he projected over the dis- 
tances between establishments a 
completely relaxed and totally 
likable personality. There were 
those among the young Power 
Givers who contacted him regu- 
larly, with an eye toward detecting 
a hint that Rack was being readied 
by nature for a joining. They were 
continually disappointed and 
Power Giver after Power Giver, 
feeling the approach of her own 
time, had to search elsewhere, for 
Rack’s gray scale covering on his 
lower abdomen remained rigid, 
showing no tint of the tell-tale red 
that spoke of readiness. 



Ill 

are, I see,” said Red 
JL Earth the Far Seer from his 
sanctuary, his mind engaged with 
Rack’s, “preparing.” 
“Affirmative.” 

“A group of Breathers is over- 
working.” 

“I have seen and am content

with what I have stored,” Rack 
said. “They will have ample time 
to recover in my absence.” 

“Is it polite to inquire?” 
Laughter. Red Earth was an old 
friend and teacher. “When were 
you concerned about being polite?” 
He had spent the time storing. 
His body weight was up. His chest 
was expanded to bursting. All his 
cells were alive, fattened with 
precious air. 

“West,” he sent to Red Earth. 
“To the river and the rift.” 

“In search of hard-material 
nuggets?” 

“In search.” He sensed a regret 
on Red Earth’s part and knew that 
it was caused by the frugal nature 
of the Far Seer, begrudging him the 
waste of his energies in his own 
pursuits. He sent a hint of reproach, 
with a vivid picture of Red Earth 
with his Keeper, and got a chuckle 
in return. 

“Beautiful Wings the Power 
Giver will be alert to your needs.” 
“I thank you.” He liked the 
picture Red Earth sent, but was 
not familiar with the subject. 

“She is newly mature, assigned 
to the west of the area.” 

“Daughter of old Northern Ice 
the Healer? I knew her when she 
was, a child.” 

“The same. She is no longer a 
child.” Chuckle. “And speaking of 
maturity, I note that your tint is 
the same.” Rack did not like speak- 
ing of such matters. He closed his 
mind. “Could it be arranged, a 



joining there would be a propitious 
event.” 

Joining was a matter of nature’s 
design and of personal choice. 
Rack told Red Earth so and was 
acknowledged, but the hurt in the 
Far Seer’s mind softened Rack 
and he sent soothing things, along 
with the rational conclusion that if 
Beautiful Wings were indeed newly 
mature his readiness would prob- 
ably not match hers. Red Earth 
agreed with a sigh. 

“I will, of course, check.” Red 
Earth said. 

“For that I am grateful.” 

End. 



I NTO the end-of-circle storms 
he moved, freshly charged, 
walking with a distance-eating gait 
over the bare bones of the planet, 
hard rock underfoot, scales tingling 
as the low spots sent projectiles 
against him, cells dying and re- 
forming even as he went, lungs 
closed as heavy clouds passed, gills 
venting poison, lungs taking only 
the scattered particles of life from 
the noxious mixture. He knew long 
periods of nonbreathing between 
high spots, which held a hint of life 
in the air to help him keep from 
utilizing his vital store in the cells 
of his body. 

There was a wild beauty in the 
outside. The constant swirl of 
heavy gases, the changes of light. 
The feeling of being alone. Far off 
he could sense an establishment.

IF 




closed tightly, inhabited by an old 
Healer whose venturesome soul 
was now confined to a body unable 
to withstand the rigors of the 
outside. Ahead of Rack stretched 
wilderness, vast, empty. He alone 
was life, moving through sterile 
spaces, the clouds eddying about 
him, the sun filtering down, now a 
glow, now only a hint of color, 
never visible as a spot, a round 
source of heat as he knew it to be — 
only a diffuse feeling under the hot- 
house clouds with the rocks hot 
under his feet. 

He skirted a sinkhole, feeling the 
corrosive strength of its deadly air 
on his scales. A small shower wet 
him. The nearness of the sinkhole 
added to the moisture and his scales 
crackled as acids sizzled and boiled. 
A swirl of the thick cloud gave him 
a dim view of the rank growth of 
the low spot, tangled, pulpy mass. 
He picked his way carefully. A slip 
would have been fatal, for not even 
his healing abilities, not even his 
tough protective scales, would have 
saved him had he fallen into that 
hellhole. 

The land sloped upward grad- 
ually and the going became easier. 
He walked again with long, strong 
strides, the weight of his pack 
light on his back. On the plains 
of glass the wind was a steady force 
in his face. Billowing clouds moved 
overhead, but the heat of the 
smooth plain seemed to form a 
pocket of fairly decent air im- 
mediately above it, so he breathed 



more easily, not using his stored 
life. 

He camped in the center of the 
plain, coverlet over him, the heat 
and emissions of the smooth, 
glassy earth tingling his scales, his 
cells working. He awoke with the 
first glow of day, fed, strapped on 
his pack and set off at a swift pace, 
eager to put the plains behind him 
before another night overtook him. 
His jogging pace ate up his re- 
serves, but there would, hopefully, 
be good air near the great river. 

He could smell the river from 
afar and it urged him on. To his 
disappointment a heavy accumula- 
tion of gases hung over it, hiding it 
from his view until, pushing 
through the low growth of vegeta- 
tion lining its banks, he stood with 
his feet wet, vainly trying to see 
the tall, broken rocks of the escarp- 
ment on the other side. 

The water was clean. It was, of 
course, lifeless, but it made a plea- 
sant contrast to the heaviness of 
the sea, where he spent his working 
hours. He waded in, felt the cool- 
ness cover his scales, wash away 
the accumulated ash of corrosion. 
He found a few inches of good air 
at the surface, gulped it, gills 
pumping out wastes, before closing 
his outer lids and ducking his head. 
He swam, his natural buoyancy 
keeping him just below the surface. 
He opened his outer lids to find that 
visibility was good, although there 
was nothing to see. He walked the 
last short distance on slippery rocks

tumbled into the water at the edge 
of the escarpment. He breathed air 
at the surface of the water before 
starting his climb and then made 
the ascent slowly, examining the 
exposed bones of the planet as he 
went. 

H ALFWAY up he became be- 
mused by brown streaks 
making erratic patterns in the rock 
wall. The discoloration reminded 
him of the waste formed on his 
precious small nugget of hard 
material. He had seen such evi- 
dence before in his travels and had 
once asked his teachers an oblique 
question regarding them. There 
was, of course, no real proof, but 
still he could not keep his mind 
from speculating. Could the hard 
materials have been natural de- 
posits within the forbidden depths 
of the soil? In places where the 
forces of nature had bared the 
subsurface rock the ground took on 
a new look. 

He spent much of the remaining 
light climbing the escarpment, 
searching in vain. At the top, pick- 
ing his way through boulders that 
dwarfed him, he felt the effects of 
the strenuous climb and quickly 
found a sheltered place. He co- 
cooned himself within his protective 
sheet of The Material, fed and was 
sleeping before the darkness of the 
night closed over him. 

He awoke to a feeling of delicious 
aloneness. A storm was raging. 
Wet rocks poured moisture as the 



yellowish rain fell, formed rivulets 
over low-worn areas, dripped, ran, 
splashed down the near wall of the 
escarpment. He lay inside his 
shelter, hearing the hiss of the acid 
rain on the impregnable Material. 
The storm, he knew, would have 
the effect of washing the air, 
leaving behind, hopefully, workable 
conditions. The rain would have 
another effect — a heavy downpour 
often found pockets of loose ma- 
terial atop the hard rocks and 
washed them clean, leaving be- 
hind newly exposed areas. He had 
hoped for just such a storm and it 
was fortunate that it had occurred 
during his first night on the plateau. 
The hunting would be interesting. 

He walked the steaming rocks, 
his pack in place, for he would not 
return the same way. The high 
plateau extended roughly north 
and south along the western bank 
of the river. In spots of irregular 
formation rock dams backed up 
lakes of dull water. However, it 
was not the river’s edge that in- 
terested him, but the central por- 
tions of the plateau where endless 
sun circles of time had allowed 
the rain to wash the rocks clean, 
leaving behind an accumulation of 
various sizes of stone. He walked 
with his eyes down. He saw only 
earth stuff. The going was slow, 
since he had to pick his way care- 
fully. Now and then a loose stone 
rolled under his foot, causing him 
to struggle for balance. 

To add to his splendid isolation, 




he had closed off his mind. He 
asked for no contact. He could 
summon help in the event of dire 
emergency, for Red Earth’s mind 
wps far reaching and a Power Giver 
was in the western area. But he 
envisioned no such emergency 
and remained calmly confident 
in his ability. 



D URING the first two days 
he covered ground with 
which he was partly familiar. Then 
he moved southward. The bleak 
landscape was unchanged. It was 
a world of exposed rocks, long 
since eroded clean by the storms. 
He was the only life, save for some 
thin air-feeders growing on the 
protected side of the largest boul- 
ders. Nothing moved — only the air, 
heavy, laden with poisons lifted 
from the rank low areas, shifted 
by the vast movements of the 
atmosphere. 

His broth supply was holding out 
well and he was finding enough air 
to conserve the vital stores within 
his body. A lull in the storms al- 
lowed him to cover — his mind 
pictured a distance based on com- 
paring his progress with the well- 
known- image of the distance 
around the planet. He rested. 

During the night the winds in- 
creased and new clouds of forbid- 
ding density moved over the 
plateau. He spent the day in his 
protective cover, unable to breathe, 
using his life stores sparingly, al- 



lowing his body to lapse into a^state 
of sluggishness during which his 
heart thudded only rarely. Although 
slowed, his mind was able to work, 
to take coenesthesiac stock of his 
condition. He was satisfied. 

The new storm blew through the 
day, into the night, calmed, began 
anew at dawn. The inactivity galled 
him, set his mind to speculating to 
escape boredom. He reviewed all 
his knowledge and wished for a 
contact with a Keeper to double- 
check, but did nothing, since the 
distances and energies involved 
would have been a drain. 

He would not admit, even in the 
privacy of his mind, that he was 
indeed looking for a fabled lost 
city. Yet there was some connec- 
tion between his being here and in 
his having once heard an uncon- 
firmed legend regarding a lost city 
beside the river. To indulge himself, 
give his mind occupation while the 
storm blew and there was no 
breathable air, he speculated on the 
Old Ones. If it were true that the 
land had once been rich with grow- 
ing things, the waters sweet, then 
the Old Ones would have sought 
locations such as this, near water. 
The city, if there had been one, 
could have been on either side of 
the river, but the legend repeated by 
the western Healers had specified 
the western bank. That meant the 
plateau. And since the plateau was 
a fairly recent development on the 
scale of time extending so many sun 
circles back that his mind could not

hold the picture, the city would 
have been lifted with the upheaval 
of the earth, tumbled, broken. 

The rains would long since have 
washed away any trace of it. Ex- 
cept, perhaps, for the hard ma- 
terials, which were heavy, heavier 
than the stones, heavier than the 
deadly soft soil of the low areas. It 
was his vague hope that particles 
of the hard material had become 
lodged in the broken fields of 
stone atop the plateau. 

The hope might indeed prove a 
foolish one. There was still no con- 
nection, except in his imagination, 
between the Old Ones and the hard 
materials, but he was on his free 
time and he would not have been 
content to spend it in the confine- 
ment of his establishment. It was 
his feet that tingled from the walk- 
ing, his scales that sizzled when the 
acid rain struck them, his cells that 
were being used as he lived on his 
stored air. If he spent the rest of 
his life span using his free time to 
walk the desolate places — it was 
his life. And even if he never found 
another nugget of hard material he 
would be rewarded by the mere 
seeking, the experiencing — the 
knowledge that he, Rack the 
Healer, had come to know vast 
stretches of his own world with 
his own feet. 



W 'HEN at last the storm 
abated enough for him to find 
some air he moved on. He came 



upon the sinkhole near the mid- 
point of the sun’s day cycle and 
looked down, expecting to see the 
usual rank growth, the poison ac- 
cumulation of heavy gases, and was 
amazed to find that not only could 
he see to the bottom of the rather 
large depression in the solid surface 
of the plateau; he could smell the 
goodness of clean air. There was 
vegetation on the floor of the 
depression, true, but it was not 
made up of the misshapen things 
of other sinkholes. It was more like 
the harmless stuff that grew along 
the river bank. It was sparse. He 
squatted to examine his find, his 
senses straining. He could, hear 
running water. He moved tenta- 
tively down the sloping face of the 
depression, taking stock as he 
went, finding no deadly stuff, only 
an improvement in the air he 
breathed. Encouraged, he went 
down, down, until he stood on the 
floor of the small valley and con- 
firmed that the vegetation was 
not the deadly sort. The air was 
even cleaner than he had found it 
during his descent. A rising current 
in it lifted the heavy, noxious gases 
and dispersed them into the over- 
hanging clouds. 

He advanced across the valley 
floor, feeling the unfamiliar soft- 
ness of soil under his feet. He 
walked gingerly, for only a fool 
trod freely on the deadliness of soft 
earth. This soil, however, was 
surprisingly free of the hard part- 
icles that destroyed cells more

IF 




rapidly than the most healthy 
healer could replace them. 

He made his way toward the 
sound of running water and came 
upon a wonderfully clear outpour- 
ing. It came from the rocks 
underlying the soft earth, bubbling 
up with a cheery sound, so trans- 
lucent that he could see small soil 
particles circulating in it. He 
tested it gingerly and found it to 
be scalding hot. He knew then why 
the small valley, shaped much like 
the navel on a young Power 
Giver, was not like the usual low 
spot. In the relative coolness of the 
air that lay over the plateau the 
water was making vapor. Even in 
the heat of the summer it would 
still be much hotter than the sur- 
rounding air, thus creating up- 
currents and discouraging the 
growth of the noxious weeds of the 
sinkholes. 

He was squatting on the edge of 
the basin into which the astound- 
ingly clean water flowed from its 
source within the rocks of the 
valley wall. The soft earth under 
his feet sent out particles, true, 
but even if the quantity were more 
than the emission of solid rock, it 
was still less than the quantity 
encountered in a dense cloud. It 
was well below the level of danger 
for a Healer and therefore ceased 
to concern him. 

His interest was drawn by the 
movement of the water as it 
swirled into the basin. Pebbles, 
disturbed by the fall, made little 



bell sounds. The water seemed 
about waist deep. The flow was 
strong. Seeking an outlet from the 
basin, the stream had cut through 
the soft earth to bedrock and 
loose stone. It wandered, as he 
followed it, from the side of the 
valley toward the center, making 
loops and swirls and lined with 
harmless vegetation. The water, 
incredibly, remained clean. The 
bed of the stream was covered 
with loose, rounded pebbles. He 
had never seen anything quite like 
it. 

Fascinated, he continued to 
follow the stream until it formed 
a small lake near the far wall, the 
wall closest to the edge of the 
escarpment and the* river, and from 
that lake there was no outlet, lead- 
ing Rack to think that it must be 
seeping down through the earth at 
the bottom of the lake, as water 
seeps through rocks, to find the 
level of the river below. 

The most pleasing thing about 
the valley, however, was not the 
meandering stream and its mira- 
culously clean water, but the 
relative purity of the air. When a 
cloud passed, hanging low, noxious 
vapors filled the valley for only 
short periods of time before they 
were lifted by the rising currents. 
It was almost as if the valley 
generated its own clean air. He 
did not understand, but neither 
did he question. He walked on the 
strange-feeling softness, examined 
green, slick, harmless growths

alongside the creek, left the water 
reluctantly to explore the re- 
mainder of the valley. By then, 
having located nothing as exciting 
as the water, he was tired and it 
was growing dark. He slept with 
the sound of running water in his 
ear. 

I N THE light of morning, 
invigorated by sleep and good 
air, he examined the stream with 
closer attention. He knew the 
erosive effect of moving water and 
accepted the fact that the stream 
had cut through the thick layer of 
softness, a layer fully as deep as 
the distance between his out- 
stretched thumb and finger, to the 
rocky underlayer. He put his 
hands into the water and handled 
the smooth, rounded pebbles. He 
could feel the heat through his pro- 
tective hide — the water was hotter 
than the hottest day in the southern 
regions. He was bemused by the 
smoothness of the pebbles, fingered 
them with pleasure, sorted them to 
size, arranging them on the green 
covered bank. It was pleasing to 
start with the larger pebbles, stack 
smaller ones on top to form a small 
mound. He was for the moment 
a child, playing children’s games. 
His mind was idle. At first he did 
not note the difference in weight as 
he fingered a small, rounded pebble 
and lifted it. Then the shift of a 
cloud allowed a glow of sunlight 
and the pebble in his fingers 
glowed with a life of its own, yellow 



and rich. He made an explosive 
sound through his small lips. Hard 
material. Of much the same heft 
as his treasured nugget of gray hard 
material, but yellow, unbelievably 
rich and beautiful. 

Feverishly he stirred the pebbles 
of the stream, roiling the water with 
the accumulation of silt in the 
stones until he was unable to see. 
He berated himself for greed. 
Many a Healer went through life 
without finding a single nugget 
of hard material. He now owned 
three — and the last was by far 
the most wonderful. 

He spent a long period contem- 
plating it. Wonderful as it was, it 
showed no signs of having been 
crafted. It was irregular in shape, 
but smoothed by the action of the 
stream. It showed no hint of cor- 
rosion. It stayed yellow even in the 
tainted air. 

When he was filled with the sen- 
sation of seeing, touching, feeling 
it, he began to speculate on its 
origin. It had been lodged in the 
pebbles when he found it, at the 
bottom, being heavier than the 

pebbles. Would not the heavy 

materials naturally sink into the 
earth? No. The earth was solid. 
Yet it had been there at the bottom. 
Perhaps it had been formed by 

nature under the soil’s surface. He 

shuddered. Seated on the softness 
of the strange ground he could 
more fully comprehend the mean- 
ing of below the surface. Walking 
on solid stone or on the smooth- 



28 



IF 




ness of the plains of glass, one 
oftep forgot that there was a 
subsurface. Here subsurface had 
meaning — one^ could imagine it 
below the soft earth. 

He placed a careful hand on the 
bank of the stream, down low, 
near the surface of the water. The 
hard projectiles tingled his small 
finger scales, but the increase was 
insignificant. Had the action of 
the running water cleansed the 
soil itself? 

An entirely new concept thun- 
dered into his brain. He loved life, 
revered it, as did every member of 
the race. He would not have con- 
sidered breaking the most ancient 
of laws, lest he harm prematurely 
the precious gift with which he 
was entrusted. Yet he had held his 
hand below the surface, next to the 
exposed soft soil of the creek 
bank and he had lived, had not 
even been endangered. This valley, 
he thought, was different, unlike 
any other spot on the planet, at 
least any spot he had seen. The 
air was cleaner. The water was 
incredibly pure. The running water 
cut through the soft surface and 
exposed pebbles and beautiful 
nuggets of hard material. 

He walked to the basin, watched 
the rushing water emerge from the 
rocks. Experimentally he moved 
stones, placing them where the 
water gurgled from the confining 
basin. He made a guilty search of 
the area and found only solitude. 
He told himself he was not 



breaking the law. He was merely 
shifting rocks — and this was 
permissible as long as the rocks 
were lying free on the surface. 

The pile of rocks grew. Water 
ran around and between the stones, 
undeterred. He filled chinks with 
small pebbles, scooped the coarse, 
gritty small^ particles from the 
floor of the basin and the creek. 
The basin level rose, kept rising. 
The flow of water was slowed. 

His tough feet dislodged green, 
slick material from the banks of 
the creek and he picked up a piece, 
seeing that a certain amount of the 
soft earth clung to it. He was 
shocked. He dropped the offending 
bit of green, picked it up again. 
It was lying free, wasn’t it? He was 
stretching logic, true, for his feet 
had freed it. But it was free and it 
had a wet, spongy feeling. He 
placed it in the chinks between the 
rocks of his dam and it impeded the 
flow of water so well that he 
recklessly trod up and down the 
banks of the creek to loosen jnore 
of the green material to be used to 
close the chinks. 

A trickle of water began to run 
from the far edge of the basin. At 
first it was soaked up by the soft 
surface soil. Then it puddled, ran. 
He watched, fascinated, waiting for 
it to begin to do its work, to cyt into 
the loose dirt and expose the rocks 
underneath. 

B Y NIGHTFALL his diverted 
1 stream was running all the 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



29 




way down the valley to join the old 
stream a short distance below the 
basin. The water running over the 
new earth was made dingy by its 
passage, yet the cutting away of 
the soft material had not begun. 
He spent an uneasy, guilt-ridden 
night. His curiosity of the morning 
overcame his guilt, for the work 
of the night-running water had, 
indeed, begun to loosen more of 
the soft particles of earth. There 
was a noticeable depression in the 
new stream bed and here and there 
rocks showed through. Moreover, 
the hard projectiles were no more 
frequent then before. 

It was to be a very slow process. 
He determined that some days 
later. The bed of his diverted 
stream was still composed of 
softened mud. 

He left the valley reluctantly. 
He was caught in a fresh storm 
and weathered it inside his 
protective covering of The 
Material. He wandered and ex- 

plored, but nowhere did he find 
anything as interesting as his valley. 
He found only bleak, barren rocks, 
the river, the western slope of the 
giant upheaval, tumbled, broken, 
yielding nothing. 

During a lull in the storms he 
jogged to the east, coming on his 
valley just as he began to eat 

seriously into his reserves. He 

breathed his air, watched his 

stream work, noted that more and 
more rocks and pebbles were 
showing in the new stream bed. 



He slept beside the heated water 
of the basin for nights and nights, 
spent his days searching the old 
stream bed for more hard-material 
nuggets, found none. Impatient, 
as his time grew short, he began to 
search the new stream bed, first 
removing his dam so that the 
water sought its original channel. 
He found only mud and bare, un- 
polished pebbles. He worked 
feverishly, the technique familiar 
now, to create a new dam and to 
build up the low area on the side 
of the basin where his first arti- 
ficial creek had overflowed. The 
new channel was cut with madden- 
ing slowness. As his time grew 
shorter and shorter he lessened his 
daily ration of broth and watched 
the storms worsen, the sun circle 
drew toward its end. 

He found the object on his last 
day in the valley. The timing 
seemed to have significance. It 
was as if nature had withheld her 
bombshell to the last possible 
instant before revealing it casually 
to his hands as they sorted through 
rocks and pebbles in his second 
stream bed. He knew when he 
picked it up that something ex- 
citing was happening. The object 
was smooth, oblong, rounded on 
the ends. It was darkened and 
pitted. And it was strangely light in 
his hands, having neither the 
weight of natural stone nor the 
heavier feel of the hard materials. 

He cleaned it in the running 
water, rubbing the accumulated 



30 



IF 




mud from it, heedless of the fact 
that in fingering the mud he was 
technically digging. The mud was 
from below the surface. But his ex- 
citement allowed no moralizing. 
The object was different. It 
had the look, the feel of being 
crafted. He cleaned it and saw 
that it was transparent and was 
at first deflated. It was, he felt with 
a sinking heart, merely an aban- 
doned piece pf The Material, but 
further examination and compari- 
son .proved his conclusion wrong. 
Like The Material in transparency, 
it was not as light, had not the feel 
of life possessed by the smooth, 
flexible Material of the Far Seers, 
was definitely artificial and 
totally alien. It was obviously not 
a product of his civilization. That 
left two choices. Either it had 
fallen from the sky, as suggested 
by some Far Seers in connection 
with the hard materials, or it had 
been made by some inhabitant of 
the planet. 

He prepared his arguments as 
he packed and left the valley. He 
was convinced that he had a 
thunderclap to toss into the minds 
of Red Earth and all the other 
doubters. For if the object in 
his pack had not been made by 
his civilization and if it had not 
fallen from the sky — then there 
was only one other explanation. 
It was a relic of the Old Ones. And 
to have evidence that the Old Ones 
could have fabricated something of 
that nature, so like The Material, 



would force a revision in the 
thinking of the entire race. 

IV 

H IS pack, almost empty of 
broth, was light on his back. 
But it became evident even before 
he had gained the eastern bank of 
the river that he had underesti- 
mated the severity of the weather 
conditions. In a short picture of 
days the new circle would begin 
and time — pictures of changes in 
the face of the satellite, which he 
himself could not see, but for 
which he had an inner feel— would 
bring the abatement of the winter 
storms. Meanwhile the outside 
atmosphere was chilled to slightly 
above his own body temperature 
and the southeasterly movements 
of the masses of polar air were 
violent enough to cause waves of 
concern to wash through Rack’s 
self-confidence. He had already 
been afield longer than ever before, 
thanks to the store of relatively 
good air in his valley. However, 
good as the air had been, he had 
been gradually using his reserve 
stores and now, with the plains 
of glass stretching endlessly ahead 
of him, he tried coenesthesis and 
projected and found that he did 
indeed have cause for concern. The 
air was totally unbreathable. Not 
a particle of it was allowed below 
the lock above his lungs. He tested 
it and his gills pumped violently, 
sending condensed clouds of pure 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



31 




poison swirling out from his neck. 

He scouted up and down the 
river in a vain effort to add to his 
stores. Not even at water level 
could he find clean air. Nothing 
was left for him to do but strike out 
across the plains and hope for a 
blreak in the solid overcast. He 
moved at a steady slow pace, 
designed for maximum distance 
at minimum cost. Fresh, he 
made it across the plains in — a 
double picture of a day. Now he 
would be lucky to be able to set 
foot on the rocky soil of the eastern 
side in — a question, followed by a 
discouraging picture of days. 

He did not fear for his life. 
Should his being become endan- 
gered, he would call for aid. But 
only as a last resort. His pride 
would push him on. His regard for 
others would cause him to expend 
his own life force rather than call a 
relatively fragile Power Giver out 
of her safe retreat into the deadly 
storms. 

At the end of the day he had 
made discouragingly small prog- 
ress, so he pushed on in the 

darkness of night, guided by 

instinctive sense of direction. 
He paused long enough to finish 
his broth supply, overeating in an 
effort to accumulate quick energy 
for a dash. Refreshed, he jogged, 
burning himself, until the first 
light of dawn glowed weakly 
through the solid curtain of 

gases that lay over the plains. 

Where the plains dipped he would 



bend to explore the air near the 
surface, but the conditions were 
total. 

He rested under his sheet of The 
Material and measured. He had as 
far to go as he had come — and 
beyond the plains the rugged, 
broken land stretched for more 
than that distance again before he 
approached the nearest establish- 
ment. It would be a breach of 
politeness to break in unan- 
nounced on another individual's 
privacy, but life was the important 
thing and no one would turn him 
away. Thus he set as his goal the 
establishment nearest the badlands 
on the east of the plains of glass 
and prepared himself for the un- 
pleasant task of imposing his 
needs on another. Remembering 
the importance of the piece of 
material he carried in his pack, 
he was consoled. 

H E COULD feel the strain as 
he moved out with long 
strides, but more slowly than he 
would have wished. His scales 
registered a high amount of 
projectile emission from the heavy 
atmosphere. His feet were begin- 
ning to know a certain soreness. 
He did not waste energy in trying 
to heal them, but saved even that 
small portion of his force for 
fueling his giant pump, the vital 
organ within him that sent blood 
swirling through his body to pick 
the particles of good air from 
storage cells and carry strength 



32 



IF 




to where it was needed. The dis- 
comfort he felt was his just punish- 
ment for having overstayed his 
capacity. 

Another night found him ex- 
hausted and still on the plains. 
His senses had dulled. He no 
longer had an exact picture of the 
remaining distance. Endless plains 
flowed under his feet. He was 
isolated within a circle of vision 
extending scarcely beyond his 
outstretched arm, closed in by the 
densest clouds he had ever ex- 
perienced. It would be interesting, 
he thought, to compare notes with 
Red Earth’s Keeper and learn 
how many sun circles one would 
have to look back to find a storm 
of equal toxicity. He would have, 
he thought, a great tale for his 
offspring. 

The thought, he realized with a 
start, was strange for a Healer 
who had shown no signs of readi- 
ness. Perhaps the knowledge of his 
own mortality had prompted the 
wayward speculation. For he was 
indeed threatened. For the first 
time in his life he was in a situation 
from which he could not, even 
with his vast endurance, his 
strength, his own resources, 
extricate himself. He admitted it 
now. He was in beyond his own 
abilities and it was only a question 
of time before he would have to 
open his mind and admit his failure. 

His pride pushed him forward. 
Each step used up his reserves. He 
was slowed to a crawl, but he was 



determined to make it to the rocks. 
There, with any luck at all, he 
would be able to find pockets of 
usable air. Calling a Power Giver 
into the thick of the stagnant storm 
would rob her of a portion of her 
life and. Power Givers being the 
most short-lived, fragile beings of 
the race, he refused to ask such a 
sacrifice. 

He was moving slowly, pain 
signals telling him of far-reaching 
waste of his body, when his feet 
encountered a roughness instead of 
the hopeless smoothness of the 
plains and, for a moment, his 
spirit was lifted. He made re- 
spectable time into an expanse of 
boulders, his sensitive nose seeking 
air, finding only unusable gases. At 
his pace he was still more than a 
day’s march from the nearest 
establishment. 

Over him the stagnant masses 
of gas began to shift. He could feel 
the movement on his scales and was 
given one last hope. If the storm 
began to blow out — behind it might 
come cool air of a usable purity. 
He wrapped himself, slowed his 
metabolism, went into a state of 
nearly suspended animation. His 
heart moved only occasionally and 
his mind darkened and slowed. A 
few good lungfuls of air would 
give him enough strength to make 
the establishment. 

But the movement of the air 
masses ceased — the blow was only 
a local, temporary thing. He mea- 
sured. He could, he estimated.

V 



safely wait the coming of a new 
day. He dropped his heartbeat to 
the minimum level and, in a state 
of quasi-death, waited through the 
long night. His mind held only a 
token of awareness — a spark of 
life lay there, banked, waiting to 
rouse him, waiting to open the 
gates and send out that last des- 
perate admission of foolishness. 

Dimly, the rising sun lighted the 
rocks, the stark desolation. Aware- 
ness of the day seeped through the 
protective layers of his mind. He 
stirred. The conditions were still 
total. A feeling of overwhelming 
sadness swept him as he opened, 
sent. 

The sadness was replaced by 
horror as he realized the weakness 
of his signal. He burned the last 
of his reserve cells, converting the 
energy into a truly desperate call 
now — and knowing even as he 
lapsed into darkness that he had 
waited too long. His last awareness 
was not fear of death, but shocked 
horror at his miscalculation. His 
mistake would take one unit of 
life — it simply happened to be his 
own personal unit — from the piti- 
fully small store of life on the 
planet. He was not mourning his 
own loss, but the loss his careless- 
ness had inflicted on the whole. 

His brain was numb, dark. His 
extremities were beginning to lose 
the flexibility of life. He was un- 
aware as nature, sometimes kind, 
sometimes cruel, spared him the 
knowledge of his dying. 



H E knew when he felt the caress 
of good air in his lungs that 
he was still alive. He lay on an un- 
familiar rack, his huge chest pump- 
ing at a fast rate, his depleted cells 
drinking thirstily, his lungs suck- 
ing air at a tremendous rate. He 
stopped breathing immediately, 
rolled back his outer lids. He found 
himself establishment-safe and 
opened his inner eyes to see in the 
semidarkness. 

“Thank you,” the thoughts of a 
Power Giver said. “I was afraid you 
were going to bankrupt me of air 
before you awoke.” 

He was covered. The coverlet was 
unnecessary in the comfort of the 
establishment, felt rather warm, 
in fact. He threw it off and sat up. 
She, the Power Giver, was in the 
chair. As he swung his legs off the 
rack she averted her eyes and this 
was strange. He sent abject shame. 
She negated. 

“You heard, then?” he asked. 
“No. Red Earth the Far Seer 
sent me. You were out so long. He 
was searching.” 

“To Red Earth, too, I owe my 
expressions of shame,” he said. 

She would not look at him. He 
couldn't blame her. His seemingly 
foolish behavior had sent her out 
into the storm. Moreover, he had 
been unconscious upon entering 
and, as he had encountered the 
good. Breather-manufactured air 
of her establishment, he apparently

had voided his gills. A small cloud 
of heavy, poisonous stuff was shift- 
ing wispily in the small currents of 
air created by his movement. It 
had accumulated on the floor. He 
bent, breathed it, stored it inside 
his gill sack. He would void it later 
outside. Meantime he was deeply 
in her debt. In cases of dire emer- 
gency the niceties were sometimes 
forgotten, but Rack could not for- 
give himself for having soiled her 
private air, for having used an un- 
forgivable amount of it. She would 
be on short rations until the over- 
worked Breathers made up the 
deficit. 

“There was a reason,” he said. 

“Yes, I’m sure of that.” Her 
eyes were down, her inner lids 
closed. 

“You’re Beautiful Wings the 
Power Giver?” 

“Yes.” 

“Would a small gift repay you 
even in part for your sacrifice?” 
He had seen his pack on the 
floor. He opened it, brought out 
the precious nugget of hard 
material. He stepped in front of 
her, hand extended. Astoundingly, 
her face began to glow through the 
delicate covering of tiny, be- 
jeweled scales. Even more astound- 
ingly he found himself looking at 
her as he had never looked at a 
Power Giver before, noting her 
delicate proportions. She was a 
small girl as Power Givers went, 
with long, delightfully curved 
limbs, a slender waist, a graceful 



chest on which, flattened, protected 
by silvery scales, her bulges were 
quite pronounced. He had always 
been an admirer of the grace of 
the Power Givers, but never before 
had he been so smitten with any 
one individual. He was suddenly 
speechless. 

“It is not necessary,” she sent. 

“I want you to have it. It is 
material of a certain scarcity. It 
would adorn you.” He pictured a 
mounting of The Material with 
the beautiful yellow hard material 
framed on her rounded chest. The 
glow of her face became even more 
pronounced. It was certainly 
strange behavior for a sensible 
Power Giver. But he himself was 
feeling strange. Because of his 
near brush with death? Even now 
he could feel the depletion of his 
resources. His body weight was 
down massively. 

“May I ask how much it cost 
you?” He waited politely for her 
answer. 

She sent a picture of her condi- 
tion. He was pleased. She was 
vibrantly healthy. Apparently her 
excursion into the storms had cost 
little. “Fortunately,” she sent, 
“you moved within — ” a measure- 
ment in picture form — “of my 
establishment.” 

“Then 1 am pleased and insist on 
your having this.” He pressed the 
nugget into her hand and the 
touch electrified him, sent a surge 
of pure goodness through his 
body. Alarmed, he stepped back.

his gaze falling, his suspicions 
growing. He read himself and now 
it was his face that glowed through 
his scales, for in the bulge over his 
pelvic area the large, protective 
scales were tinted a dull russet. 
He knew then why she had covered 
him, knew why he was looking at 
her with an interest he had never 
felt before. He fell back, seized the 
coverlet in agitated haste, draped it 
over his middle. He sent waves of 
shame and atonement. 

“It is merely nature,” she sent. 
“It’s just — it’s just — ” She went 
blank. 

H E HAD exposed himself 
shamelessly. His state of 
confusion following his rescue 
from death was no excuse. When 
entering the state of readiness one 
secluded oneself from polite 
society, bore the change in solitude 
until, fully readied, one went in 
search of a mate. To expose one’s 
first tint to the opposite sex, 
especially to one who was not, her- 
self, going through the change, 
was unforgivable. He could only 
send regret, ask for forgiveness. 

“You were unaware,” she said. 
“I understand.” 

He closed off, unable to bear his 
shame. She fingered the nugget of 
hard material, her inner lids open 
to see. “It is truly beautiful. Is 
this the justification for your trip?” 
“Beautiful as it is — no.” He 
opened his pack, showed her the 
strange object. She examined it 



with wondering hands and eyes, 
glanced at him fully for the first 
time. 

“What is it?” she asked. 

“Truthfully, I don’t know,” 
he said. “But my not knowing helps 
to explain its importance. As you 
can see, it is not The Material, 
nor is it anything with which we 
are familiar in our high state of 
civilization.” 

“Is it a thing fallen from the 
space outside?” she asked. 

“That again I do not know.” He 
looked at her. She once more held 
her eyes down and he knew a 
strange, sweet feeling of peace. And 
in her concentration she forgot to 
hide her own feelings, let her 
nature express itself with a flower- 
ing of scales on the delicate bulges 
of her chest, opening them 
slightly, as the flower of the slime 
source opened under the thick, 
salty, mineralized waters of the 
sea. His heart pounded. She was 
incredibly young. The change 
should have been sun circles in 
her future, yet here was the un- 
mistakable sign. The flowering of 
her chest bulges was revealed only 
momentarily before she became 
aware of the erotic sensation and 
closed them, glowing furiously. 

“Beautiful, Beautiful Wings,” 
he sent, searing her with his 
emotion. Then, as she recoiled, he 
eased. “I knew your father, North- 
ern Ice the Healer. In my travels 
I talked with him — and I knew you 
as a child.” 



36 



IF 




“He is dead these — several sun 
circles.” 

A warmth swept through his 
body: Emotions surged, flooded 
him, made his interior go soft and 
flowing. “I am not mistaken?” he 
asked, sending a replay of the 
sweet, unconscious flowering of her 
chest bulges. She answered in a 
warm affirmative. But she reached 
for an opaque sheet of The 
Material and covered herself before 
looking at him. Wild, warm 
thoughts flooded out of him, 
thoughts about nature, fate, luck, 
bringing them together, amaze- 
ment that she should begin her 
change so young, pleasure in his 
eyes’ picture of her. 

“Am I truly?” she sent. “Am 1 
truly beautiful?” 

“Affirmative, affirmative, af- 
firmative.” Repeating the picture 
of pleasure in his eyes, standing 
before her, tall, strong, manly. 

“There are many others,” she 
said. 

“They do not matter.” 

“I have heard that a Healer is 
prone to love the first Power 
Giver changeling he encounters, 
but that this love is illusionary and 
not necessarily the indication of a 
wise choice,” she said. 

“It is true. Our custom will re- 
quire that I seek.” 

She closed. He sent one last 
beautiful picture into her closing 
mind and got a febrile, grandly 
complimentary, girlish picture 
in return. The moment was gone. 



“You are to seek Red Earth’s 
establishment as soon as you are 
able.” 

“True,” he said. “I have much to 
report.” 

“He was fretful.” 

“I little doubt that.” 

“Will you be reprimanded?” 

“I don’t think so. Not when I 
show him this.” He took the 
strange object from her hand. 
“Red Earth’s mind, although he 
won’t admit it, is as curious as that 
of <my Healer’s.” 

He read the state of the air in the 
establishment, monitored the 
activity of her Breathers, who 
were working overly hard because 
of the drain of two sets of lungs. 

“I have taken enough of your air. 
I have ample stores to reach Red 
Earth’s establishment.” 

“I will transport you.” 

“No!” He was emphatic. He 
would not allow her to go out into 
the deadly storm again on his 
behalf. 

"I have been so instructed.” 
“Then we shall disobey,” he 
said. He allowed himself one 
breath of her air, bowed. As he 
went out into the lock he sent a 
picture of his returning. He felt 
a warm glow in answer. 



H IS own establishment was 
nearer than Red Earth’s. 
He jogged through the barren 
stretches joyously, feeling a re- 
newed strength. He vented his gills

in his own lock, entered to find a 
huge store of air so rich it made him 
giddy. He breathed furiously, 
causing much agitation among his 
Breathers, felt his weight build, 
his chest expand, his tired, empty 
cells fatten. Thus enriched, he ran 
swiftly through the dark, thick 
storm, feeling an exaltation he had 
never known before, dressed now 
in the loin cloth of readiness. Beau- 
tiful Wings’ coverlet, used during 
the trip from her establishment to 
his, was cleaned and ready, back 
in his establishment, to be returned 
to her — as return it he would. 

He made the march in short time, 
feeling only a slight drain on his 
reserves, so fat was he with air. He 
announced his arrival, was admit- 
ted to the lock, vented his gills, 
shook the ash of the outside from 
his scales, sneaked one look at 
the russet bulge in his loins. Inside, 
Red Earth was lounging on his 
rack. Rack greeted him cordially, 
holding back the sensational 
information. 

“You are fat and refreshed, I 
see,” Red Earth sent grumpily. 

“1 will use none of your air,” 
said Rack. 

“A pleasant change,” Red Earth 
said, an oblique reference to Rack’s 
hungry breathing of Beautiful 
Wings’ air. “A nugget of hard 
material is scant exchange for life.” 

“If you were observing so 
closely,” Rack said, “did you also 
see the valley of the hot water?” 

“I have more to do than follow 



the ramblings of an irresponsible 
Healer,” Red Earth sent. 

“Then I have much to tell.” 

“I am interested only in the 
breakdown of your coenesthesis 
and the reasons for your being 
stranded in the wilderness. And 
in those solely with a view to 
preventing such happenings in the 
future. Perhaps your punishment 
will inspire other Healers to use 
more caution.” 

“I do indeed deserve punish- 
ment,” Rack admitted. “However, 

I think other considerations also 
deserve attention.” 

“Your state of coming readiness 
is noted and will be considered.” 
Red Earth sent a noncommittal 
image. “We cannot, even in an 
event such as this, neglect the pos- 
sibility of creating a new unit of 
life.” He let slip his foolish hopes 
and Rack grinned inwardly as 
he saw pictures of speculation. It 
would indeed be ironic if Rack, in 
disgrace, should sire the New One. 

“I am not speaking merely of 
that,” Rack said. He slowly 
produced the object, holding it on 
the palm of his hand, moving to 
stand directly in front of Red 
Earth. The bald, bare dome of 
Red Earth’s head did not move, 
but Rack could feel the push and 
probe of the Far Seer’s senses. He 
extended the object, gave it 
over to Red Earth’s hand. For 
long moments the Far Seer ex- 
amined it, then with an explosion 
of emotion threw it from him. 



38 



IF 




It hit the soft, yielding wall and 
fell to the floor. 

“From the subsurface!” Red 
Earth flared unbelievingly. 

“True,” Rack admitted. 

He underwent a blast of anger 
and shock. He stood his ground. 

“You dug,” Red Earth accused 
him. 

“Not true.” 

“I sensed the taint of soft earth, 
the deadliness of the earth.” 
Waves of anger, fear, sorrow. 

Rack began to be seriously con- 
cerned. He was well aware of the 
law against digging. It was a law so 
absolute that the mind of the 
oldest Keeper held no record of its 
having been broken. 

“If you will listen — ” 

“Not I,” Red Earth sent sadly. 
“No, I will not listen. There will 
be a council. Then we will listen.” 

“That will take time,” Rack 
sent desperately, remembering the 
soft flowering of the delicate 
scales on Beautiful Wings’ chest 
bulges. He sent a powerful picture 
of his need, his love for Beautiful 
Wings, the pull of nature, the 
necessity of proper timing. His 
russet tint would deepen, become 
flame red. The flowering of 
Beautiful Wings’ chest bulges 
would become involuntary and 
expose the soft flesh underneath 
her scales. And there would be 
other changes, changes that left 
him weak merely to contemplate 
them. 

His desperate plea was rejected 



coldly. Red Earth was tightly 
closed. In the whole of civilization 
there were only — a small picture 
of unbreakable laws — and Rack 
had broken the most severely en- 
forced one. It was unthinkable. Yet 
it had happened. No other consid- 
erations could stand against that 
fact. Even the chance for new 
life, the most desired event in the 
life of man, was unimportant. 

“Please, you must listen. I 
myself did not dig.” 

“I will keep the evidence of your 
folly,” Red Earth said sternly. 
“You will not be given the op- 
portunity to cleanse it further, 
although you have, obviously, al- 
ready tried to erase the traces of 
the subsurface from it. You will 
return to your establishment. There 
you will stay until a council can be 
arranged.” A picture of time, 
extending past the time of storms 
into the new beginning, too late, too 
late. By then Rack’s tint would 
have long since faded. The moment 
would have passed. 

“You will not listen?” he asked. 

“I am but one. The serious 
nature of this crime demands a 
Council.” 

“And my readiness?” Rack 
asked 

“Wasted.” And over Red 
Earth’s anger and shock and fear 
hung a shroud of sadness. “Go.” 

H E LEFT. He picked his way 
slowly to his establishment, 
paying no heed to the waste of his 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



39 




energies and forces. Inside, he 
fell into his rack. He felt unjustly 
used. He had not dug. The water 
had dug, not he. And his lack of 
guilt was proven \$y the fact that 
he had suffered no ill effects from 
his experiment — and had been re- 
warded by the discovery of an 
amazing object which, to his 
astonishment, had not aroused 
Red Earth’s deepest curiosity. Even 
a Power Giver — Beautiful Wings, 
oh, Beautiful Wings — had been 
impressed. Any Healer would 
have been beside himself with 
excitement. But to a cold-blooded 
Far Seer the suspected breaking of 
an ancient law was the issue, not 
the mind-boggling mysteries of 
the obviously crafted object. The 
situation was completely without 
logic. 

Rack’s world was an orderly one. 
It ran on age-old principles proven 
by time. In his orderly world such 
misunderstanding was not possible. 
It was unbelievable to him that 
he was to be robbed of his chance 
to add a spark of life to the scant 
life force of the planet. Who 
indeed was breaking the law? Not 
he. The law-breaker was clearly 
Red Earth the Far Seer, who was 
trying to impose his will on 
nature to negate one of her most 
elemental forces. 

Beautiful Wings. Ah. 

He opened, sent. The distance 
was far too great. But in his 
state of openness he intercepted 
Red Earth’s message, directed 



over Rack’s establishment to 
a northern Far Seer — the call 
for council. And the urgency in 
Red Earth’s thoughts made a cold 
chill run down Rack’s spine. Upon 
absorbing Red Earth’s charges 
he began to realize the seriousness 
of his predicament. In a world 
that revered life he did not fear 
death as a punishment, but in 
outlining the crime Red Earth 
touched on possible punishments 
that chilled Rack’s mind. Banish- 
ment. To the far southland with 
its burning earth and choking gases 
belched up from the planet’s 
bowels? Or to a lonely station at 
the far north where the frost sheet 
never melted, to live out his days 
cold and alone? 

He closed and considered. In all 
fairness he was due to be ques- 
tioned, for his actions in the small, 
pure valley had, been out of the 
ordinary. His use of running 
water to cut through the shallow 
layer of soft earth was, at best, a 
daring innovation — and Far Seers 
were affected strongly by any hint 
of innovation. Life’s balance was 
so precarious that experimenta- 
tion was to be carefully considered 
before being undertaken. 

But he had done no harm. Not 
in the valley. His only crime had 
been in his having stayed too long 
and having had to waste some of 
the life force of Beautiful Wings to 
extricate himself out of his self- 
created crisis. For these sins he 
would gladly accept a punishment

IF 




tour in the far north, a tour of 
limited duration, beginning after 
his joining. But could a guilty one 
select his own punishment? No — 
still, such sentences had been 
handed down in the past. 

He would not — could not — 
accept the punishments being 
suggested in advance by Red 
Earth, for they meant more than 
death. Not only his own death 
after a long, agonizing loneliness, 
but the death of his unborn, 
unconceived offspring. The planet 
would be deprived of two life 
units. Could not the Far Seers 
understand that? If he had indeed 
dug in the earth — then he would 
have expected the most severe 
punishment, now would accept it. 
Deserve it. 

Or would he? 

An entirely new line of thought. 
If he had dug in his valley by hand 
he would have, according to his 
measurements, suffered no bodily 
damage. So where was the crime? 

R ACK prowled his establish- 
* ment, striding, breathing 
carelessly. He slept little, awoke 
to find his russet loins turning a 
pinker, brighter shade. He 
pictured Beautiful Wings the 
Power Giver and the image was 
unbearably sweet. He remembered 
her welcoming of his suggestion 
that he would return and he con- 
templated the loss of his only 
readiness— for to have more than 
one change in life was rare. He 



was young. He felt that he was in 
the right. 

“If I am a law-breaker,” he 
told himself, “then I am lost — but 
the sins of the father should not be 
extended to obviate his seed.” 
Thinking in such terms, with his 
loins pink and bright, seemed 
natural. Nature moved in him, 
making chemical changes in his 
body, sending delicate urges into 
his brain. 

He made his decision in the 
midpoint of the sun’s day cycle. 
Red Earth, in his intercepted 
thoughts, had indicated contact 
with every Far Seer east of the 
river. Completion of such a 
roundup would take time and 
energy and would, Rack estimated, 
cover the period of this day, 
another day and possibly still 
another. The establishment of 
Beautiful Wings the Power Giver 
was a quick jog away. And if he 
were indeed a criminal he was not 
responsible for his actions. More- 
over, he could be punished only 
once. And once implanted in 
Beautiful Wings’ body, his seed 
would be life — and thus sacred. 

His decision made, he stored a 
maximum quantity of air, packed 
his winter’s supply of broth, 
packed in addition a sealed con- 
tainer of closely crowded Breathers 
to add to Beautiful Wings’ 
colonies. He marched swiftly, 
heavily burdened, not able to. 
breathe in the fierce storms which 
had now reached their peak of

deadliness. She was waiting, 
sensing his coming from afar, 
meeting his mind and discussing 
the situation with him as he jogged 
through the bleak, atmosphere- 
darkened emptiness. At first she 
was shocked and reluctant about 
his coming, but his emotion- 
filled thoughts swept her objections 
aside. The feelings of a Power 
Giver at joining time were nature’s 
strongest force. And she had seen 
Rack’s beginning tint, had felt 
the strength and power of his 
personality, had seen the beauty of 
his body. 

She stood inside the establish- 
ment, unable to control the 
flowering of her chest scales as 
he entered. They opened out deli- 
cately, flaring in a curling sheet, 
forming a ring around delicate 
pinkness, the flesh of motherhood, 
the flesh from which the offspring 
would feed. Rack, on seeing her, 
felt his own scales stir and move. 
He sent beauty, beauty, love. And 
she answered with a sweetness 
that made his knees weak. 

Quickly he joined his container 
of Breathers with her colonies, 
making the number sufficient for 
two. Then, his gills having been 
vented in the lock, he loosed 
stored air from his huge body and 
felt his storage cells give gladly to 
share with his love. In a sweet, 
rich plenty of air they stood, 
looking, inner lids wide, Rack’s 
vibrant blue gaze sparkling with 
his energies. He could see far into 



Beautiful Wings’ brown eyes. Her 
soul was open to him. 

“You, too, may be punished,” 
he sent. 

“No punishment could take away 
the memory of this.” 

“We have” — he sent a picture of 
the time remaining before Red 
Earth could complete his contact 
with the eastern Far Seers. “Then 
he will check and find that I am not 
in my establishment.” 

“When I first saw you — when I 
was a child — I dreamed of this 
day,” she sent. 

“Our time could be shortened if 
he discovers me here.” 

“But we will have created life.” 
The picture of incredible beauty 
and passion made him tremble. 

“Before I throw aside my 
covering,” he sent, “be sure, 
Beautiful Wings.” 

“I will be content with one 
night, if nature will allow. My 
only fear, my only regret, is for 
you. For, as you know, the mind of 
a Far Seer is powerful.” 

“In all of history there has 
been no record of its being used 
fatally.” 

“But he is agitated. In all of 
recorded history no one has 
dug.” She sent the last picture 
regretfully. 

“I think not of myself,” he sent. 
“But of you.” 

“For me the mere throwing 
aside of your covering will open 
a world of delight — ” 

Slowly he drew aside his opaque 



42 



IF 




covering. She made an audible purr 
of pleasure and, in return, drew 
aside the belt of fashioned Material 
to show that she, too, was at the 
height of her readiness. He learned 
then the full picture of her name — 
it came from a historic picture of a 
soaring thing, fragile, brightly 
colored, delicate. He had never seen 
such loveliness and his entire being 
vibrated as she moved languidly 
toward him. 

His eyes caressed the pink, 
exposed breast buds, his fingers 
trembled as he touched them and 
felt her body heat and her softness. 
The red tint of his maleness covered 
his lower body, scales folding 
back. 

“Now we will join,” he whis- 
pered, leading her to the rack. She 
sat down, legs crossed, and , he 
duplicated the position. Looking 
deep into her eyes, he let his mind 
merge with hers. He knew the 
fullness of her mind; he let his 
own lose its individuality, lock 
with hers. He knew her most basic 
thought as she knew his and a 
rapture lifted them out of time and 
space. Their limbs, bent under 
their bodies, felt strain but did 
not register discomfort as the night 
fell and the planet spun on its 
axis and swam toward the new 
beginning. 

They required neither food nor 
air. They fed on themselves and on 
each other. Throughout the long, 
dreamy night, as the storm raged 
and the survival factor reached its 



lowest sun-circle point, they 
caressed minds — and when at 
last the sun glowed through the 
yellow and purple poisons of the 
outside a state of pure ecstasy 
linked them and not even the 
force of Red Earth’s anger could 
have broken their locked emotions. 

She came to him with the sinking 
sun. Her exposed feminity drew 
him and the union began, sweet 
and true and of such a totality that 
the Breathers, half-life that they 
were, stirred uneasily in their 
colonies. Softness met softness — 
his penetration sundered her and 
the day passed without their notice 
and another night found them 
poised on the brink of the ulti- 
mate experience. When it 
happened she cried out, vocally, 
her expelled breath sweet. 

VI 

I N RARE cases, when love was 
strong, the joining urge was not 
satisfied with one experience. Thus 
it was with Rack and Beautiful 
Wings. So perfect had been the 
preliminary union of their minds, 
so sweet was the seed planting, 
so devastating the pleasure that his 
tint become only more fiery and her 
ruby femininity did not fade when 
they separated. True, her chest 
buds were covered, his scales 
folded, but the strong emotions 
continued to rage. 

Had they not been in the grip of 
nature’s most powerful force 



THE BOOK OF RACK THE HEALER 



43 




neither of them would have con- 
sidered the desperate measure 
suggested, at the height of their 
joining, by their combined minds. 
Time, they knew in their separate 
minds, was now running out — 
time required for the scales to open 
again, for her to flower. Time they 
did not have, for Red Earth would 
be checking and his powerful 
probe would soon find Rack. They 
had no idea what then would 
happen. They knew only that they 
would be separated and the thought 
was intolerable to each. 

The survival factor outside was 
fearfully low. To elude Red 
Earth meant going out into that 
hell of poison. To Rack a brief 
exposure was not serious, but to a 
fragile Power Giver even a short 
time outside, with the atmosphere 
giving off potent projectiles, was 
folly. It would be subtracted from 
her life. But Beautiful Wings was 
in love and filled with the glory 
of having, perhaps, a new life . in 
her. 

“I will not be robbed,” she sent. 

He protested, but he, too, was in 
love. He, too, felt the great 
biological, chemical and emotional 
stresses. He could breathe for her, 
they both knew, give her air from 
his lungs, but he could not shield 
her from the deadly projectiles. 

“It is my life, love, and I will 
gladly spend part of it.” 

“I cannot allow it,” he sent. 

“For I will not live long if you are 
sent to the south.” 



He could feel the power behind 
the statement and he believed, for 
in rare cases the union produced 
a lifetime of love, an ability to 
blend minds even when nature 
forbade the joining of bodies. 

“I would hate myself — I myself 
would die if your life were 
shortened.” 

“Then we die together.” 

T OGETHER they packed the 
broth, a supply sufficient to 
last them through the winter/ 
Together they loaded the Breathers 
into travel containers of The 
Material. He winced as he mea- 
sured the load she would have to 
carry. But they were now commit- 
ted, for a tentative probe from 
Red Earth’s mind had located 
the two. Red Earth’s powerful 
forces were grouping, woulcl come 
thundering in to — Rack had no 
idea of what the shocked Far 
Seer would do. Immobilization 
was the least he could expect. He 
quickly depleted the establishment, 
storing its last remaining air in 
his huge lungs. 

As she lifted he wept, for he 
could feel the drain, the using 
up of her force. And she, not 
blessed with his Healing powers, 
could not repair the damage. He 
held her tightly in his arms, 
giving her air from his mouth, 
protecting all of her that he could 
with his superior armor. The 
ascent took its toll and above the 
clouds she breathed furiously of

IF 




his stored air, trying to regain some 
of the loss. The soaring was not 
as strenuous, but the descent, 
later, again through the roiling 
clouds, caused waves of pain to 
sweep through her as she fought 
the pull of the planet. His mind 
shared the agony in hers and his 
entire being cried out at the 
injustice of it. He should have 
been the one who was sacrificing 
for their love. 

On the permanent icy frost 
of the far north he held her, gave 
her a lungful of his good air, 
entered the closed establishment 
of Northern Ice the Healer, her 
late father, set the Breathers 
working, emptied his store to 
replenish the empty establishment. 

She lay weakly on the rack, 
breathing with difficulty. He 
wept openly. Once again he had 
been criminally foolish, acting not 
against himself, but against the one 
he loved. Both he and she had 
underestimated the cost of her 
load and she was now paying it. 
Her very substance had been used. 
She looked thin, drawn-out. But 
she smiled at him and directed 
his attention to her breasts, which 
were being exposed slowly as 
she flowered, as the ruby tint 
spread and her lower scales 
opened and those delicate, soft 
buds swelled with nature’s bounty. 

“Poor Rack,” she sent. “Don’t 
suffer more than I — for I gave 
myself gladly and would do it 
again.” 



Twice blessed by nature, they 
were alone in the far north, beyond 
the full stength of Red Earth’s 
punitive measures. No Far 
Seer was near enough to intrude 
upon their privacy. The hard- 
working Breathers expelled good 
air, made the long unused establish- 
ment comfortable. The unac- 
customed chill served merely to 
invite body closeness. - 

He held her 2 saving her remain- 
ing strength. More than anything 
in his world he wanted to lift the 
suffering from her, to put it into 
his body, where it rightfully be- 
longed, for the entire situation was 
of his making. The soft tendrils 
of her mind pressed at his shame 
points, caressed his pain and 
sorrow. 

“I will live to give birth,” she told 
him, inside him. Her body antici- 
pated and Rack learned the wonder 
of growth, the swelling of life. He 
learned the movements of labor and 
the emergence of a new life. He 
could not help but exult. He and 
she moved into oneness and a 
fierce pride of achievement sent 
strong radiations reverberating 
around the domed establishment. 
Their new ecstasy mounted until, 
facing each other, seated lock- 
legged on the rack, the beauty of 
their communication became all. 
In Rack a bewilderingly powerful 
sadness mixed with the most 
complete happiness he had known 
— for he was loved beyond the most 
basic value, the regard for life.

The joining began and extended 
into time without end, without 
thought. 

J OININGS were routinely 

monitored by Far Seers and 
this far-north joining was noted 
and measured. The northern Far 
Seer nearest to it recorded that he 
was awed by its force, intensity and 
duration. 

He recorded more. 

A Healer knows the flesh of a 
Power Giver once, rarely twice. 
The observing Far Seer noted that 
Rack, the fortunate one, knew 
more. He knew flesh and total 
love and even in complete union 
kept his awareness of his Power 
Giver’s depleted condition and of 
the fact that he and he alone was 
responsible for it. Neither Rack nor 
Beautiful Wings . considered, the 
Far Seer recorded, that the very 
uniqueness, the desperation, the 
strains, the aspects of doom of 
the union were adding to the depth 
of their emotions, but that obvious 
conclusion was made by the Far 
Seer before he, awed and made 
tinglingly envious, withdrew to 
seek his sterile consolation with 
his personal Keeper. 

And so missed what followed. 
Rack knew only that he would 
forsake the fight and die if his 
actions resulted in the death 
of Beautiful Wings. 

She was very weak. When the 
seed planting began she sank to 



the depths, overwhelmed by her 
joy. Rack’s mind filled with 
panic, even as his body rejoiced. 
He roared, making an animal 
sound without meaning, and 
willed his body and being into her. 
His healing cells screamed out to 
her to fight, not to give in to the 
specter that had suddenly thrust 
itself into their moment of joy. 
What he sent was not a mere 
hope or a plea — it was a command: 
Be well. And it was repeated by 
every cell of his being. His 
whole body thundered the order, 
striving to impart to hers the be- 
neficence of his healing. 

Yet she sank. 

He felt the darkness boding 
death. His mind heated, threat- 
ened to join hers in blankness, but 
in that last, wildly emotional 
moment he felt astonishing change 
roar through him. It caused 
unheard-of things to happen in 
their joining. His flesh was be- 
coming her flesh. Cell bonded to 
cell and where there had been 
lubricious friction there was a 
bond — and movement ceased. He 
felt a strange swelling and a 
sensation he could not identify 
until he felt, in his body, the 
feeble beat of her heart and the 
flow of her blood joining his. He 
became aware of the damaged 
cells of her blood and then he was 
sending his powerful Healer’s 
forces to battle the darkness, 
cell by cell. His substance was 
her substance and he was strong.

IF 




equal to the task of mending her 
frail body. At last he felt life 
spring up in her, saw her eyes open 
in wonder and look into his. He 
was too busy to pause to analyze 
the miracle. His Healer’s blood 
flowed in her veins — his cells 
were her cells and his healing 
ability worked for both of them, 
using up his stored substance, 
voiding poisons through his gills 
— and not at all concerned by this 
breach of politeness. 

“Rack, Rack,” she sent. 

The extent of her weakness 
frightened him, but he was equal 
to the task. It cost him, but he 
was giving joyously, praising 
nature for this chance to redeem 
himself, to give of himself as she 
had given of herself for him. He 
flowed in her, was part of her, 
knew the intimate processes of 
her body, healed, threw off the 
accumulated poisons, found the 
inherent weakness of the Power 
Givers in organs that could not 
reject the deadly things in the 
environment. He knew his Power 
Giver as no Healer had ever known 
his love. He made her whole again. 

He did not stop until he was 
exhausted. 

She laughed suddenly in glorious 
health and began to question him 
furiously. 

As strangely as it had begun, 
the process ceased. The flesh 
parted and they were lying to- 
gether, both aware of his seed in 
her. And Rack told her what he 



knew, for he had been able to see 
more than she. She was in the 
process of conceiving. He could 
no longer watch, but they talked 
of the mechanics of birth and 
tried to pinpoint the exact moment 
and laughed joyously and clung to 
each other. 

Later she fed him. Her being 
radiated health. He felt his 
strength returning as he consumed 
broth and filled his storage cells 
with air. Then it was time to 
wonder and be awed by the miracle. 

T HE last tints of russet left 
Rack’s pelvic region. Beauti- 
ful Wings’ scales folded into 
place and covered the soft flesh. 
But there was life within her. The 
sun, only a puny force in the far 
north, stayed below the horizon for 
a picture of normal days and in the 
cool dark they found it beautiful to 
sink into a mind-blend. Pictures 
of days became pictures of 
satellite changes and they were not 
aware of the swift passage of 
time. They had achieved the 
rare union that lasted past the 
creation of life — and were drawn 
closer by the new and exciting 
knowledge that once, for a time, 
Rack’s blood had flowed in her 
veins, that he had known her 
down to the minutest cell level, 
that he had felt and seen what she 
could never feel or see, the begin- 
nings of new life within her body. 

Responsibility intruded, after 
satellite changes of pure happiness,

in the form of the mind of a Far 
Seer. 

“Rack the Healer, will you 
voluntarily attend the meeting of 
the council of Far Seers, Healers 
and Power Givers?” 

“I will inform you,” Rack sent, 
sinking to depths of sadness. 

“Now you have how added other 
crimes,” Beautiful Wings told 
him. “They will cite your 
disobedience.” 

“And add the crime of endanger- 
ing the life of a Power Giver in 
unlawful flight,” Rack agreed. 

“I will lose you.” 

“Negative, negative,” he sent 
angrily. For it necessarily fol- 
lowed that if she lost him he would 
lose her and he could envision no 
worse fate. 

“I will go with you to the death 
lands of the far south,” she 
promised. 

“Negative, negative,” he sent, 
thinking furiously. 

“Perhaps, by some miracle of 
nature, you can heal me even in 
the death lands.” 

“There I cannot, for any picture 
of time, heal even myself,” he 
sent. 

“Then we die together.” 

“Much as I revere my own life 
— and life as an abstract goodness 
— 1 revere yours more.” He 
caressed her. “To think of you 
dead is the most terrible pain.” 

“Then we’ll flee once more. We 
will go to the lands across the 
eastern sea.” 



“Negative,” he sent, adding 
pictures of the distance, the load 
she would carry, the drain on her 
system. She was in perfect health, 
but even the most healthy Power 
Giver would be seriously drained by 
such a trip. 

“But you forget,” she chided. 
“You can heal me. You can join 
your power to mine.” 

Hope sprang up in him. Then he 
sent a negation. “In the heat of 
the union I fleshed with you. I 
have no feel for it now. I don’t 
think I could do it again, not with- 
out the emotional stimulus of the 
joining.” 

“We could try.” 

T HE problem was that without 
the flowering of scales that 
accompanied the physical union 
there were no flesh areas to bring 
into contact. Armored hand on 
armored hand gave a heady and 
pleasant sensation, but produced 
not even one spark of that 
strange power Rack had felt during 
the union. Rack considered. Every 
portion of Beautiful Wings’ body 
was protected by her small, decora- 
tive and flexible scales, save for the 
inside of her small jnouth and the 
inner lids of her eyes. He examined 
her small, protected lips, used his 
finger to open them, looked into 
the pink, toothless maw. Her 
vestigial tongue was small and 
pink. His own tongue barely 
extended past his armored lips. 
“We can only try,” he sent.

IF 




placing his lips on hers, thrusting 
out his tongue to feel the fleshy 
interior of her mouth. 

She giggled. 

“A sensation not to be despised, 
dear Rack.” 

“Quiet, I am thinking.” 

Flesh on flesh. A remembering. 
The glory of union, the softness of 
her body, the feel of her cells 
were implanted in his mind. It was, 
he found, surprisingly simple. He 
had only to will it and his tongue 
welded flesh to flesh, melted into 
her, knew her. Through that small 
contact of united flesh he sensed 
the processes of her body, made 
minor healings. He closed off the 
contact, knowing a wild elation. He 
would never have to be without her 
and his healing abilities would 
make her as long-lived as he. Only 
the ruin of his system would bring 
death to both of them and that 
would be many, many sun circles 
away. He knew the feeling of com- 
plete victory, and then it was tinged 
with regret. 

“I know,” she sent. “Responsi- 
bility is a heavy thing.” She 
touched him, sending a warm glow 
through the scales of his arm. “But 
we can contribute. The people to 
the east, it is said, are much like 
us.” 

“But they are not our people.” 

He had, however, no choice. Had 
he not loved her he would have gone 
to the council, would have faced 
his punishment, would have used 
the forum to try to convince the 



Far Seers of the importance of his 
find— that strange object from the 
valley of the hot waters. But know- 
ing that his own banishment would 
abandon Beautiful Wings to the 
sure fate of Power Givers, early 
death — and that he could save her 
— he had to take the chance. 

T HEY practiced soaring. The 
position made for some dif- 
ficulty. Mouth to mouth with Rack, 
flesh welded to flesh, Beautiful 
Wings drawing not only on Rack’s 
substance, but also utilizing his 
power of mind to reinforce her 
own push against the magnetic 
field of the planet, she had diffi- 
culty seeing where she was going. 
But flying became effortless and 
without cost to her substance and 
they worked out a system of mind 
signals. Sometimes, too, they 
seemed to share joint vision — 
and this was a distinct advantage. 

Having become proficient in joint 
flight, Rack guided their soaring 
movement to a position over Red 
Earth’s establishment. 

“I am Rack the Healer, bringer 
of new and startling develop- 
ments,” he sent. 

“You are Rack the Healer, 
madman,” Red Earth sent angrily, 
adding astonishment and shock 
that Rack was once again reck- 
lessly using the very life substance 
of a Power Giver for wasteful and 
illegal soaring. 

“I ask only a hearing,” Rack 
sent, “a fair and impartial forum

composed of equal numbers of 
Far Seers and Power Givers and 
Healers. ” 

“The law,” Red Earth sent, “is 
the law. Your new and startling 
developments have been judged, 
after careful study, to be the result 
of unexplained forces in the depths 
of space.” 

“The Far Seers err and dream 
dreams of the unimaginative 
mind,” Rack sent, himself becom- 
ing a bit angry. “Much has hap- 
pened since we last spoke and I 
showed you the hard new object 
I brought from my travels and on 
which you judge me. The object 
is clearly crafted and must, there- 
fore, be the work of the Old Ones. 
As such, it should not only receive 
the attentions of the scholars 
among the Far Seers, but should 
also be subjected to the specula- 
tions of the scientific Healers. And 
I demand a trial.” 

“It is the will of nature that the 
Far Seers hand down the law,” 
Red Earth said. “Tell me, Healer, 
your justification for continued 
defiance.” 

“In the interest of the race,” 
Rack said. “In that interest I have 
traveled far. In that interest I 
risked death and disgrace and in 
return I am scorned and judged 
without a hearing.” 

“In your absence a hearing has 
taken place,” Red Earth said 
pointedly. “Your flight from jus- 
tice was your testimony.” 

“If the Old Ones were capable 



of crafting so unique a material,” 
Rack said stubbornly, “what else 
could they accomplish? Of how 
much more than we have shown are 
we capable? In view of new evi- 
dence, I demand a renewed effort 
to rethink our position. We must 
learn the lessons of the past for 
the sake of the future.” 

“You seek to dig in the earth and 
release death,” Red Earth said 
sadly, seeing behind his words a 
picture of the valley of hot waters. 
“This we will not allow. I have been 
empowered to my sorrow to — ” 

But Rack was prepared. As the 
Far Seer gathered his energies 
Beautiful Wings sent Rack and 
herself soaring high into the pur- 
pling sky, into the regions of non- 
air, into the coldness of the upper 
reaches. Yet the bolt from Red 
Earth’s mind found Rack and 
momentarily dulled his senses. 

Shocked, he realized that it had 
been meant to be a killing blow. 
Had he not anticipated it and re- 
moved himself from the range of 
Red Earth’s lethal reach, he would 
have been a lifeless form clinging 
inside Beautiful Wings’ field of 
power, draining her, leaving her 
without his healing protection. 

“So be it,” he said. Body to 
body, they accelerated, leaving the 
zone of the sun for the darkness to 
the east, sensing the rolling sea be- 
neath them, seeking the land of the 
east, fleeing those who would kill. 

TO BE CONCLUDED

T HE old man refused to get 
aboard. He was still in the 
house as the last few stragglers 
climbed the car steps. They could 
see him peering through the win- 
dow, his face bristling with con- 
tempt, his fists white and clenched 
against the sill. 

. One of the monitors jumped 
from the last car and climbed the 
cracked steps, three at a time. 

“Come out of there,” he yelled 
when he entered the house. “We 
can’t wait any longer.” 

“Nobody asked you to wait,” 
said Ben from the other room. “I 
told you, I’m not going.” 

The man swore. “That front 
section has been underway for two 
hours. She’ll go any minute.” 
“Good, by golly, and it can’t be 
too soon.” 

“You old fool, this is no time to 
pull childish stunts.” 

Ben came out then. “This is no 
stunt. I’m not going with you. 
You’d better hustle your tail before 
you’re stuck here with me.” 

The monitor stood in angry in- 
decision for a long moment. Then 
he hurried out to the train. 

The old man moved to the win- 
dow and watched them argue. He 
knew what was coming next. 
Taking the gun from behind the 
books in the bookcase, he checked 
the load. 

They came across the road three 



abreast, pounded up the steps, 
pushed in through the open door. 

He stood in the middle of the 
room with his gun aimed at the 
first man. “That’s far enough.” 

The three stopped and shifted 
their feet, looked at him uneasily. 

“We can’t leave you all alone,” 
said the oldest. “You’ll die.” 

“So will you, one day,” said Ben. 
“What’s wrong with you? Why 
are you doing this?” 

He answered quietly. “I’ve got 
five or six years left, maybe, and 
I’m not going to spend them look- 
ing at some damned horizon no 
human ever laid eyes on.” 

“That doesn’t make sense. Is it 
the train? Are you afraid it won’t 
take us through?” 

Ben knew he was wasting his 
breath but he said it anyway. “I’ve 
never cared much how I died, but 
I’m particular about where.” 

“You can’t want to stay on this 
stinking sewer of a world.” 

The old man’s fingers tightened 
on the gun. “Get out,” he said. 
“Get out of my house. Get off my 
Earth. Go jump on your kiddy car 
and ride.” 

“You have to come with us.” 
“The gun says different. I bought 
it when this scheme was first cooked 
up and I didn’t buy it for fun. I’ll 
shoot the first man who tries to 
drag me out. That includes you.” 
They took turns speaking: 



52 



IF 




“We can’t wait any longer.” 
“Better come, old man.” 

“You’ll die all alone.” 

“You’ll never see another 
human.” 

“You’ll never hear another 
voice.” 

“You’ll wish you were dead.” 
“You’ll end up killing yourself.” 
“Go to hell,” said Ben. 

They left then. He watched 
through the window as they 
boarded the train. Everybody 
looked back. He saw their faces 
clearly. No one wept, no one 
looked regretful. 

Suddenly the train shuddered. 
In the next instant it was gone. 
Without a sound it had fled into 
the tunnel of time. 



H E FELT a hard thrust of pain 
and a sob leaked from his 
throat. Steadying himself against 
the window he dropped the gun 
on the floor and blinked his eyes. 
Numbly he rubbed his palms on 
his shirt. He cocked his head to 
listen for sounds. The clock in the 
kitchen gave a little ping. Some- 
where a wall squeaked. A faucet in 
the bathroom dripped and the hot- 
water tank in the basement 
hummed. He heard his own breath- 
ing. He stood there and knew that 
these were the sounds he would 
hear for the rest of his life. He was 

LAST TRAIN FROM EARTH 



the only human being in the 
world. 

He sat on the porch swing and 
played his harmonica, and while 
the sweet tones of Clementine 
lifted along the avenue he rocked 
and let his thoughts sift through 
the lost years and the dead dreams 
of his lifetime. 

Presently he dozed. The wind 
whispered between houses and the 
sun sneaked through the smog to 
warm pavements and roofs, to 
glint upon handlebars and shiny 
surfaces of bicycles and 
automobiles. 

At dusk he awakened. He could 
see the trees in the park across the 
boulevard and he thought that in 
the morning he would go there 
and live where it was cool and 
Earthy. 

He had his dinner and went to 
bed. 

At dawn he tied a few cans of 
food in a sweater, placed his hat 
on his head and walked out of the 
house he had lived in for fifty 
years. 

There were twelve cabins in the 
park and he chose the smallest. It 
contained a kitchen, a bedroom, 
a tiny bath and a shower stall. 
After he checked the fridge and 
bathroom to make sure that every- 
thing worked he stood in the door- 
way and looked out across the 
grassy clearing. The end of his 

53 




love affair with the sod upon which 
he had been born was not far 
away. He couldn’t live long, alone 
this way. He was old and accident- 
prone and one day soon he would 
forget what he was doing or mis- 
count his steps, and that would be 
that. 

He wished that he were young 
again, with the Earth all his, so 
that he might stride out upon her 
scarred surface and begin to heal 
her wounds. He would beg her for- 
giveness for crimes that had never 
been his but the race’s from which 
he had sprung and together they 
would survive, each fulfilling the 
measure of his existence until at 
last death came to them both in 
the same instant. But it wouldn’t 
be like this. He would die without 
healing anything and the Earth 
would be a spaceship that carried 
his corpse through billions of miles 
of dark universe until one day she 
herself staggered and died. And 
then there would be nothing. 

He crossed the clearing and 
slumped onto a bench. With the 
sun warm on his shoulders he 
closed his eyes and played Old 
Black Joe on his harmonica. The 
words beat through his brain, re- 
vived old memories. 

Gone were the days when a boy 
took his first good look at the world 
about him and knew with an exul- 
tant thrill that he was a powerful 



creature in an environment of 
beauty, glory and danger. 

Gone were his friends, but he 
wasn’t sure he wanted to call them 
friends. There surely had been 
one close to him. Could a man 
live for so long in the same world 
with so many others without find- 
ing one kindred spirit? No, there 
had been one. But weren’t a man’s 
sons his friends? Had there never 
been a trace of Willa in those angry 
young men who had cursed him 
yesterday and forced him to drive 
them away with a gun? 

Now they were gone from the 
Earth, they and all the rest. To a 
better land? But he knew there was 
no better land. No matter where 
they were now it wasn’t Earth. 

A static wail came from the har- 
monica and he dropped it and 
buried his face in his hands. 

He sat on the bench all day and 
watched the sun drift across the 
sky. As it was setting he dragged 
the cot from the cabin, placed it 
in the clearing and lay down and 
covered himself. 

T HE sky was unusually clear 
and as the stars winked into 
view he began to count them. He 
was past fifty when he saw the 
flashing light in the east. He 
watched it and tried to remember 
if there was a satellite in that area, 
but so many had been tossed into 



54 



IF 




the sky that he couldn’t keep track 
any more. 

The last thing he saw as he closed 
his eyes to sleep was the flashing 
light moving across the heavens. 

Dawn woke him. Rubbing the 
sleep from his eyes he look drowsily 
at the sky and then sat up in sur- 
prise. The brilliant orb that was 
the sun lifted over the horizon and 
moving along beside it, small but 
vivid, was a streaking comet. 

He went into the cabin long 
enough to wash and eat his break- 
fast. Then he took his place on the 
bench once more to watch the sky. 
By mid-morning he suspected that 
it wasn’t a comet at all. By eleven 
he was certain of it. The streaking 
thing could only be a spaceship. 

Just as the sun reached the center 
of the sky the ship cracked through 
the atmosphere and thundered 
toward the ground. 

The vessel was a tongue of orange 
flame, monstrous in length and in 
girth. Ben placed its origin as some- 
where in Europe or Asia. He knew 
America had never made so large a 
ship. 

Heat fanned his face and he 
threw his hands over his eyes. 

Still far away from him, the 
ship’s jets cut off and the missile 
flew silently toward him, floated 
effortlessly to the ground and 
landed on its Tinned tail. 

A man dressed in brown came 



out of a door and jumped to the 
ground. He raised a hand to wave 
and Ben walked to meet him. He 
was a slender young man with 
dark eyes and a thin face. Ben 
carefully looked him over. He 
wasn’t European or Asiatic. It was 
impossible to place him. Several 
other people stepped out of the 
ship and stood looking around. 
They all resembled the first man 
and it was impossible to place any 
of them. 

“You’re too late,” Ben said 
bluntly. “They’re all gone.” 

The stranger pushed his hair out 
of his eyes and smiled. “So we dis- 
covered when we were coming in.” 

“They said they called everyone 
back. You must have been a far 
piece. Jupiter, maybe? Too bad you 
didn’t come two days earlier. It 
would have saved you some 
trouble.” 

The man looked about the clear- 
ing as he spoke. “We couldn’t get 
here sooner, but it’s no trouble.” 

Ben stared at him. Here was no 
evasive, ineffectual coward. He 
thought of the whining creatures 
who had scrambled at the chance 
to get away from the foulness they 
had created. A trembling began 
behind his knees. How did a man 
find a needle in a haystack? By 
what talent did a pilot pick out the 
spot where the only man in the 
world stood? 



LAST TRAIN FROM EARTH

“Where you headed?” he 
croaked. 

“Earth.” 

“There’s nobody here but me. 
Where do you aim to go now?” 

The man gave him a keen look. 
“Why do you ask? Do you want 
to go someplace else with us?” 

Ben felt the heat rising up his 
neck. “I never said that.” 

“You sound as if you want 
something.” 

Turning his back, Ben spat on 
the ground. “I got something. 
Right there.” 

The stranger laughed. “You 
might say this is new territory for 
us. Why don’t you bring me up to 
date on what happened here.” 

“Doesn’t matter how long you’ve 
been gone. The world hasn’t 
changed, not for the better, for 
fifty years.” 

“Maybe I just want to hear you 
tell it.” 

“Maybe you just think I’m a 
lonely old fool and you’re feeling 
big-hearted.” 

T HE man was silent and Ben 
turned to get a look at his face. 
Ben saw no pity. What he saw was 
deep preoccupation with things not 
concerned with him^ He began to 
relax. Looking at the mountain 
that rose beyond the park, he said, 
“I could tell it better if we were up 
, there. We could see the mess.” 



“Then let’s go up.” 

“I’m no goat” 

The man walked away. “I’ll give 
you a hand,” he said over his 
shoulder. 

With a scowl Ben eyed the re- 
treating back. He wasn’t a kid to 
tag after the first big man he saw. 
But he followed. 

They made it to the first high 
ledge before his legs quit on him. 
“I can’t go any farther,” he said 
and refused the other’s hand. 

“We don’t need to.” The stranger 
stood and gazed out at the shat- 
tered plateau. 

“I reckon not,” said Ben and 
winced. “What do you think of 
it?” 

“What’s that smoke rising from 
the lake?” 

“Fumes from garbage and chem- 
icals. You’d be gassed in a minute 
if you got within a thousand yards 
of the shore. Right now you’re 
breathing the stuff and you’ll be 
lucky if it doesn’t kill you. They’re 
all like that, every lake in the world, 
every river and sizeable stream.” 

“How do you get water?” 

“From the oceans, but they’re 
pretty foul too. Most of the fish 
are dead. Most of everything is 
dead. There are bugs and rodents, 
but that’s about all. It took a long 
time to kill Earth but they finally 
did it.” 

“Where are the forests?”

IF 




“They took the timber long ago. 
This park is the only one left in the 
country.” 

The man shook his head. “What 
about those holes?” 

“Strip mines. It’s like that every- 
where. They cut right into Earth’s 
guts and cleaned her out like a 
turkey and left the wounds just like 
you see them. They took it all.” 

“Why?” 

“Why did they every do 
anything?” 

“I wish you would pretend I 
know nothing about it and tell 
me.” 

Ben watched a sparrow’s flight 
across the barren hill. “Well, about 
twenty years ago a fellow named 
Swanson was fooling around with 
an atomic converter and blew him- 
self and Pittsburgh sky high. At 
least that’s what everyone thought. 
After the air cleared, the govern- 
ment sent in a team to look the 
place over, maybe rebuild the city. 
The team couldn’t find anything — 
not so much as a stray brick. There 
was nothing there, just fifty square 
miles of smooth ground. Moun- 
tains, rivers, buildings, machinery, 
all gone. It looked as if there had 
never been anything there. It took 
nearly ten years to find where 
Pittsburgh went, and it wasn’t up 
in pieces. It went through a 
tunnel.” 

“What do you mean?” 



“They called it the tunnel of 
time,” said Ben. “When Swanson 
blew up the converter he sheared 
off a piece of space and Pittsburgh 
went sailing through the hole and 
landed in another time dimension. 
I never understood. I don’t think 
anyone else did, either. No two 
people had the same theory, but 
that didn’t stop them from going 
in to see what was in that hole. 
They found Pittsburgh on an unin- 
habited planet they said was Earth 
a million years in the past. 

“The team sent back word that 
the place was perfect for coloniza- 
tion so the government ordered 
Earth stripped of everything she 
had that was worth anything. They 
took out the rest of the metals and 
shipped it through. The world is 
a hollow shell now. I figure 
she’s worth about fifty dollars, 
moneywise.” 

“Then what?” 

“Everyone got ready to move 
out. They opened up tunnels in 
every big city and pretty soon they 
were building time trains and ship- 
ping people out. They went city by 
city.” 

“How about you?” 

“My town was the last to go.” 
“But you didn’t.” 

B EN kept his eyes on the ruined 
landscape. He couldn’t answer 



LAST TRAIN FROM EARTH

the question he saw in the man’s 
eyes. What sense would it make if 
he said he had never learned how to 
be a sardine, had never learned how 
to lie immobile in the position in 
which others tried to place him? 
How could he recount his years 
of watching people behave like 
ants, how describe his attempts at 
comprehending their purposes? 
It would sound weird if he said that 
his need to discover greatness, to 
find something to admire, had led 
him to look beyond men or be- 
neath them. He had chosen his 
world as an ideal because its re- 
sponses corresponded to what a 
man did with it, because it pos- 
sessed beauty not as an abstract 
but as a reality that could be en- 
joyed with every human sense, 
because Earth let its abused parts 
wither and die and didn’t construct 
cheap masks to conceal the scars. 

He looked at the man and 
slammed his mind shut upon his 
secrets. They were his and that 
fact would always be enough. 

“I didn’t go because I didn’t want 
to,” he said. “That’s the only rea- 
son I had. I’ll never leave, so don’t 
ask me if I want to go somewhere 
with you. If you’re going, go ahead 
but it’ll be without me.” 

The man gave him a thoughtful 
look. “We’d like to stay here and 
live. We came from the other side 
of the galaxy for just that purpose.” 



“I don’t think I like your sense 
of humor.” 

The stranger made no reply. 
Instead he kneeled and picked up 
a handful of dirt. 

Ben stared down at the brown 
neck and blowing hair. “What are 
you doing?” 

The man stood up and held out 
his hand and the wind carried the 
dirt away. “Wondering how long 
it will take to make her new again. 
Which way is the time tunnel?” 

“There,” said Ben.and pointed. 

“We’ll have to close it up. We’ll 
have to close them all up. They’re 
not human any more.” 

Uneasy, Ben said, “Take it easy. 
You’ve come a long way.” 

“We’re accustomed to long jour- 
neys. But let’s go back down now. 
This is all part of the past. Only 
the future is meaningful.” 

Hastily Ben started down the 
slope. He slipped and slid over the 
stones in his hurry to get away from 
this loony who was going further 
out of his mind with every word he 
spoke. 

As he reached the clearing a hand 
pressed on his shoulder. 

“We’ll give her new life. She’ll 
blossom like a rose and never grow 
old again.” 

Immediately Ben was engulfed 
in old grief. “Sure you will,” he 
mumbled. 

Standing in the clearing with the 



58 



IF 




wind sifting through his hair he 
had the sudden wish that the 
strangers would get in their ship 
and go. He would rather be by him- 
self than spend the rest of his life 
with a bunch of loonies. But it was 
only a half-wish. They were com- 
forting loonies, or at least the one 
he had been talking to was com- 
forting. In some strange way the 
man had made all the mess seem 
soft and vague. 

A light breath of perfume reached 
. him. He stiffened and turned 
toward the nearest cabin. A woman 
stood in the doorway. She was 
young and she stared back at him 
with a little smile on her face. All 
of a sudden Ben felt his face redden. 
The way she was looking him up 
and down with that speculative 
gleam in her eye — by damn, it was 
ridiculous — but if he were forty 
years younger. 

Turning away he walked over to 
a bench and sat down with his back 
to the cabins. 

The people going in and out of 
the ship seemed to be busy. The 
ship itself— -his thoughts shied 
away from that and touched on 
other things. The sun warmed his 
head and made him drowsy. 

He would have to keep an eye on 
the ship. Crazy foreigners with 
crazy ideas, there was no telling 
what they had in mind to do. Set- 



tling himself more comfortably, he 
began to brood. How many people 
were in that bunch? They were all 
young, not a gray-headed one 
among them. He felt a slow spurt 
of resentment. These men and 
women were out of place on a 
beatup world with no one in it but 
a beatup old man. 

He’d have to keep an eye on 
them. 

He intended to, but the sun on his 
back made him change his mind. 
His head tilted toward one shoulder 
and a soft snore startled him. He 
jerked erect. A moment later his 
body wilted down onto the bench 
and he slept. 

Later it seemed that hands were 
touching him but his subconscious 
mind gave no warning of danger. 
Fingers moved over his skull. Then 
something capped his head. Some- 
where in the distance he heard 
voices. 

“Careful with that thing. He 
must be pushing ninety.’’ 

“Right. Let’s hope this softens 
the shock for him.” 

Ben was dreaming that he was 
in a Fishbowl. A silvery, wire-thin 
trout swam into his ear and on into 
his brain. He began the other 
dream at once. 

He saw a planet adrift in the 
black of space. Though he had 
never seen any world other than 
Earth, something was familiar 



LAST TRAIN FROM EARTH

about this one. And he knew things 
about it. It was old, terribly aged, 
and soon it was going to die. As he 
swam in the sky over the doomed 
planet he was stricken with grief. 
This crippled globe was home. 
Here was the real home. It was 
where a man went when he was 
tired of wandering. It was the place 
of returning. 

His face wet with tears, Ben 
mourned for the end of life. As he 
grieved he saw fiery tendrils lift 
from the dying world to soar up in 
space. Hundreds of ships filled 
with Man sped outward into the 
cosmos in search of new homes. 
They scattered in every direction 
and were lost to one another. 

Ben followed one of the ships. It 
landed on an uninhabited planet 
and the men stayed there to live. 
They built cities and a long period 
of time passed. During this period 
the people found a beautiful bird 
which they freed in their sky. Wher- 
ever the bird flew it showered down 
glowing drops that fell on the land 
and transformed it to loveliness. 
No matter how ugly the land had 
been before, it became beautiful 
after the bird flew over it. 

By and by the people built more 
ships and went into space. They 
took the bird with them. They 
found many planets on which their 
brothers lived but none were as 
beautiful as their own. Some of 



their brothers were savage and 
hostile, some were peaceful, but 
they all wanted to borrow the bird. 
It was released and flew over each 
of the planets and made them 
perfect. 

That was the dream. 

Ben opened his eyes to the gray 
evening of Earth. For a moment 
he was lost and he cocked his head 
to listen for the sound of beating 
wings. It wasn’t until he stood up 
from the bench that he let the 
dream fade. This was reality. This 
was dying Earth. Here was the 
birthplace of mankind; here was 
the only place where men grew. 

H IS gaze was Fixed on the sky 
as he walked across the clear- 
ing. From the corner of his eye he 
saw the woman standing in the 
doorway of the cabin. He wouldn’t 
look at her. 

He came to a stop. “I had a 
dream. It was about a big bird.” 
“What did it do?” 

“It made ugly things beautiful.” 
He turned and gave her a hard 
stare. “You and your friends know 
nothing about ugliness and being 
lonely.” 

She laughed and the lightness 
of the sound made him angry. She 
raised one hand and idly twirled 
something around on her Fingers. 
It was a metal cap with thin wires

dangling from it. Ben gave it a 
glance and turned away. 

“See?” he said and pointed at 
the ship. “Funny looking, isn’t it? 
I’ve been thinking about that. 
Maybe you don’t think it’s funny 
looking. Maybe no one but an 
Earthman would see anything out 
of sorts about it.” 

He heard her take a step toward 
him. 

“What do you want?” he said. 
“To live on this planet.” 

His eyes were misty and he had 
to blink to see. “What am I think- 
ing?” he said. “Am I dead — or just 
crazy?” 

A hand touched his arm. He 
jerked free, then turned. “Do you 
make dreams, too?” he said. “Did 
you bring the bird with you?” 
“Yes.” 



One word. He hadn’t expected it 
and it rocked him. He couldn’t 
bear to stay there and look at her. 
She was watching him again with 
that speculative gleam in her eye. 
It made no sense. She wasn’t won- 
dering about his reaction to any- 
thing except herself. Why did it 
hurt so much when she looked at 
him that way? 

He walked away a few paces, 
pushed his face into the wind. To 
hell with all of them. He was an 
Earthman to the core of his soul. 
They would drive him batty with 
their weird talk and strange be- 
havior. Let them think or do what- 
ever they pleased. He didn’t have 
to stay here. 

Knowing he would never see trees 
like this again, he gave a last long 
look around. Then he started

toward the ship. The young man 
stood beside the door. The woman 
had joined him and they were 
quietly discussing something. 

“I’m moving on,” Ben said as 
he stopped in front of them. “Been 
thinking about Arizona. It’ll be 
good for my health.” 

“You don’t want to go there,” 
the man said. 

“1 just said I did. Free country, 
isn’t it? I can go where I please.” 
The woman spoke. “Don’t you 
want to see the bird before you go?” 
He heard the laughter in her tone 
and anger again rose in him. 
“Sure,” he said coldly. “Let me see 
it make something beautiful. Some 
little spot. Can you do that?” 

“I think so.” The man climbed 
into the ship. 

That was the moment when Ben 
began to be afraid. The man hadn’t 
smiled or looked puzzled. He had 
simply said, I think so, and then he 
had gone inside the ship. 

His fists clenched at his sides, 
Ben began backing away. The 
woman smiled and he walked 
faster. He couldn’t make his body 
stop trembling, couldn’t make his 
lungs work. It seemed that the man 
coming out of the ship with the 
strange contraption was moving in 
slow motion. The thing he carried 
was a tube of silver with three legs. 
He set it up on the ground and 
raised his head to look at Ben. 



“Where’s the bird?” Ben whis- 
pered. Suddenly he gasped because 
the silver tube was bending and now 
it was aimed straight across the 
clearing. It was aimed at him. They 
had tricked him. They were going 
to kill him. 

Rage Filled his mind and without 
thinking or caring he began to run 
toward the man who reached out 
and touched the silver tube. A ray 
of light shot from the bore and hit 
Ben on the chest. He felt nothing 
but he gave ^ cry of fury and tried 
to run faster. All at once he tripped 
over a root and fell sprawling. 
Sobbing and cursing, he started to 
crawl to his feet. It was then that 
he saw his hands on the grass. The 
world was abruptly out of focus 
and he stared at his hands and 
waited for the moment to pass. It 
never did. 

He looked at his right arm. With 
frozen fingers he rolled up his 
shirt sleeve and saw the corded 
muscles. His other arm was the 
same. He felt his cheeks, his neck, 
his forehead. The skin was soft and 
smooth. He wasn’t old any more. 
His dream had been symbolic. The 
sweet bird of youth had no wings. 

He scooped up handfuls of his 
world, gently squeezed the dirt in 
his fists, turned his head and looked 
toward the spot where the last 
train from Earth had fled into the 
tunnel of time. •

How would you like to invest in your 
future by investing in Man’s vastest 
dream? Reader James S. Burns 
wants to push what may be the sound- 
est plan yet for saving the Space 
Program: 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

I am sure you have received the news 
of the cancellation of several major 
NASA projects with the same mixed 
emotions I have . 

Cancer research is vital and domes- 
tic transportation is a thing often im- 
proved upon only in science fiction. 
Today’s system is obviously 
inadequate. 

But some of us are interested in the 
exploration and development of space 
for other reasons than to beat the 
Russians. Early in the century cars 
seemed an unnecessary luxury, but to- 
day they are an economic necessity. 
While many people today think of 
space exploration and development as 
a totally meaningless waste, a few can 
see the potential of that small ( think 
about it! — ed.) portion of matter in the 
universe that has not yet fallen to 
Earth. 

The cancellation of the NER VA 
( Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle 
Application) project means there will 
be no manned landing on Mars before 
I die. 



The cancellation of the Grand Tour 
of the Planets is not quite so dismaying, 
but it is a tragedy nonetheless. 

The reusable shuttle would possibly 
have meant trips to the moon for my 
generation. 

After having glimpsed the possibility 
of all these things, itjs now hard to give 
them up forever. Unless we do some- 
thing very few of your readers will ever 
live to see anything but a manned or- 
bital laboratory signal our planet’s at- 
tempt to understand this universe. 

The. only chance I see to save any of 
these projects is to let Congress know 
we want them — and want them badly 
enough to finance them. The Space 
Bonds program outlined in my letter to 
my Congressman (and Senator — copy 
enclosed) is one way to ensure the 
survival of some of these programs. 
It would ensure that the money we citi- 
zens want to see used for space is used 
correctly and the funds would not 
tempt every social organization in 
need of a handout. 

Please think about this. If you want 
space travel to become a reality , act 
now. 

Contact me and for your Senator and 
ask for further thoughts on this subject. 

James D. Burns 
1606 W. 14th A venue 
Pine Bluff, Ark. 71601 

Please note that Mr. Burns is speak- 
ing of investment , not just about 
making noise. His letter to his Senator 
suggests a “Space Bonds program simi- 
lar to the current U. S. Savings Bonds 
program, with the proceeds to be used 
solely on those projects NASA has had 
to drop because of lack of funds.”

THE MERCHANTS 
OF VENUS 



FREDERIK POHL 




I 

Y NAME, Audee Walthers. 
My job, airbody driver. My 
home, on Venus, in a Heechee hut 
most of the time — wherever I hap- 
pen to be other times when I feel 
sleepy. 

Until 1 was twenty-five I lived on 
Earth, in Amarillo Central mostly. 
My father was a deputy governor 
of Texas. He died when 1 was still 
in college, but he left me enough 
dependency benefits to finish 
school, get a master’s in business 
administration and pass the jour- 
neyman examination for clerk- 
typist. So I was set up for life. 

After I tried it for a few years 1 
discovered I didn’t like the life I 
was set up for. Not so much for the 
conventional reasons. I don’t mind 
smog suits and I can get along with 
neighbors even when there are 
eight hundred of them to the square 
mile. I tolerate noise and am able to 
defend myself against hoodlums. It 
wasn’t Earth itself as much as what 
I was doing on Earth that I didn’t 
like, so I sold my UOPWA jour- 
neyman’s card, mortgaged my pen- 
sion accrual and bought a one-way 
ticket to Venus. Nothing strange 
about that. What every kid tells 
himself he’s going to do, really. 
But I did it. 

1 suppose all would have been dif- 
ferent if I had had a chance at 
Real Money. If my father had been 
full governor instead of civil-service. 
If the dependency benefits had in- 
cluded Unlimited Medicare. If I 
had been at the top instead of in the 
middle, squeezed both ways. Re- 
ality ran otherwise, so I opted out 



by the pioneer route and wound up 
hunting Terry marks at the Spindle. 

Everybody has seen pictures of 
the Spindle, the Colosseum 'and 
Niagara Falls. Like everything 
worth looking at on Venus, the 
Spindle was a Heechee leftover. 
Nobody had ever figured out what 
the Heechee wanted with an under- 
ground chamber three hundred 
meters long and spindle-shaped, but 
it was there, so we used it. It was 
the closest thing Venus had to a 
Times Square or a Champs Elysees. 
All Terry tourists headed for it 
first. That was where we fleeced 
them. 

My airbody-rental business was 
and is reasonably legitimate if you 
ignore the fact that there really 
isn’t much worth seeing on Venus 
that wasn’t left there, below the sur- 
face, by the Heechee. The other 
tourists traps in the Spindle are 
reasonably crooked. Terries don’t 
mind. They load up on Heechee 
prayer fans and doll heads and 
those paperweights of transparent 
plastic in which a contoured globe 
of Venus swims in a kind of orange- 
brown snowstorm of make-believe 
fly ash, blood-diamonds and fire- 
pearls. These items aren’t worth 
the cost of their mass-charge back 
to Earth, but to a tourist who can 
get up the money or credit for his 
passage I don’t suppose that 
matters. 

To people like me the tourist 
traps matter a lot. We live on them. 
I don’t mean we draw our dispos- 
able income from them. I mean 
that they are how we make our 
bed and board, or we die. There 
aren’t too many ways of earning 




66 



IF 




money on Venus. The ones that 
might produce Real Money — win- 
ning a lottery, striking it rich in the 
Heechee diggings, blundering into 
a well-paying job — are all long 
shots. For bread and butter every- 
body on Venus depends on Terry 
tourists, and if we don’t milk them 
dry we’ve had it. 

Of course, there are tourists and 
tourists. They come in three va- 
rieties. The difference among them 
is dictated by celestial mechanics. 

There’s the quick-and-dirty 
kind. On Earth they’re just well-to- 
do. They come every twenty-six 
months with the Hohmann orbit, 
riding the minimum-energy circuit 
from Earth. Because of the critical 
times of a Hohmann orbit they 
never can stay more than three 
weeks on Venus. So they come on 
the guided tours, determined to get 
the most out of the quarter-million 
dollar minimum cabin fare their 
rich grandparents had given them 
for a graduation present or they had 
saved up for a second honeymoon 
or whatever. The bad thing about 
them was that they didn’t have 
much money after paying the fare. 
The nice thing about them was that 
there were a lot of them. While they 
were on Venus all the rental rooms 
were filled. Sometimes six couples 
shared a single partitioned cubicle, 
two pairs at a time; hot-bedding 
eight-hour shifts around the clock. 
Then people like me would hole up 
in Heechee huts on the surface and 
rent out our own below-ground 
rooms and maybe make enough 
money to live a few months. 

But not enough to live until the 
next Hohmann-orbit time, so when 



the Class II tourists came along we 
cut each other’s throats to get at 
them. 

They were medium-rich. What 
you might call the poor millionaires 
— the ones whose annual income 
was barely in seven figures. They 
could afford to come in powered 
orbits, taking a hundred days or so 
for the run instead of using the 
long, slow Hohmann drift. The 
price ran a million dollars and up, 
so there weren’t nearly as many 
Class I Is as there were of the QADs, 
but they came every month or so at 
the times of reasonably favorable 
orbital conjunctions. And they had 
more money to spend. So did the 
other medium-rich ones who hit us 
four or five times in a decade, when 
the ballistics of the planets had 
sorted themselves out into a low- 
energy configuration that allowed 
three planets to come into an orbit 
that didn’t have much higher 
energy cost than the straight Earth- 
Venus run. These last would hit us 
first, if we were lucky, then go on to 
Mars. If they ran the other way 
around we got the leavings. The 
leavings were never very much. 

But the very rich — ah, the very 
rioh! They came as they liked, in 
orbital season or out. 



W HEN my tipster on the land- 
ing pad reported the Yuri 
Gagarin , under private charter, my 
money nose began to quiver. The 
arrival was out of season for every- 
body except the very rich — the only 
question on my mind was how 
many of my competitors would be 
trying to cut my throat for the 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



67 




Gagarins passengers while I was 
cutting theirs. 

Airbody rental takes a lot more 
capital then opening a prayer-fan 
booth. I had been lucky — I bought 
my airbody cheap when the fellow 
I worked for died. On Earth it 
might have been a steal, but on 
Venus the record was straight. I 
didn’t have too many competitors 
and a couple of them were U/S 
for repairs, a couple more had kited 
off on Heechee diggings of their 
own. 

So, actually, I had the Gagarins 
passengers, whoever they were, 
pretty much to myself. Assuming 
they would be interested in taking 
a trip outside the Heechee tunnels. 

I had to assume they would be in- 
terested, because I needed the 
money very much. I had this little 
liver condition, you see. It was get- 
ting pretty close to total failure. As 
the doctors explained it to me I 
had three choices. I could go back 
to Earth and linger a while on ex- 
ternal prosthesis or I could get up 
the money for a transplant. Or I 
could die. 

II 

T HE name of the fellow who 
had chartered the Gagarin 
was Boyce Cochenour. Age, ap- 
parently forty. Height, two meters. 
Ancestry, Irish-American French. 

He was used to command. I 
watched him come into the Spindle 
as though it belonged to him and he 
was getting ready to sell it. He sat 
down in Sub Vastra’s imitation 
Paris Boulevard-Heechee sidewalk 
cafe. “Scotch,” he said and Vastra 



hurried to pour John Begg over 
super-cooled ice and hand it to him, 
all crackling with cold and numbing 
to the lips. “Smoke,” he said and 
the girl who was traveling with him 
instantly lit a cigarette and passed 
it to him. “Crummy-looking joint,” 
he said and Vastra fell all over him- 
self to agree. 

I sat down next to them — well, 
not at the same table. I didn’t even 
look at them. But I could hear what 
they said. Vastra didn’t look at me 
either — I had to let his number- 
three wife take my order. Vastra 
wasn’t going to waste any time on 
me with a charter-ship Terry at 
his table. 

“The usual,” I said to her, mean- 
ing straight alcohol in a tumbler of 
soft drink. “And a copy of your 
briefing,” I added more softly. 
Her eyes twinkled at me over her 
flirtation veil. Cute little vixen. 
I patted her hand in a friendly way 
and left a rolled-up bill in it. She 
left. 

The Terry was inspecting his 
surroundings, including me. I 
looked back at him politely but dis- 
tantly and he gave me a sort of 
quarter-nod and turned back to 
Subhash Vastra. 

“Since I’m here,” he said, “I 
might as well go along with what- 
ever action there is. What’s to do 
here?” 

Sub’s wide grin gave him the 
charm of a tall, skinny frog. “Ah, 
whatever you wish, sah! Entertain- 
ment? In our private rooms we have 
the finest artists of three planets, 
nautch dancers, music, fine 
comedians — ” 

“We’ve got plenty of that in Cin-

IF 




cinnati. I didn't come to Venus for 
a night-club act.” He wouldn’t have 
known it, of course, but he was 
making a good move. Sub’s private 
rooms were well down the list of 
night spots on Venus, and the top of 
the list wasn’t much. 

“Of course, sah! Then perhaps 
you would like to consider a tour?” 
“Aw.” Cochenour shook his 
head. “What’s the point? Does 
any of it look any different from the 
scene where we landed? And that’s 
right over our heads?” 

Vastra hesitated. I could see him 
calculating second-order conse- 
quences, measuring his chances of 
selling the Terry on a surface tour 
against what he might get from me 
as commission. He didn’t look my 
way. Honesty won out — that is, 
honesty reinforced by a quick ap- 
praisal of Cochenour’s gullibility. 

“Not much different, sah,” he 
admitted. “At least for the next 
thousand kilometers in any direc- 
tion. But I wasn’t thinking of the 
surface.” 

“What then?” 

“Ah, the Heechee warrens, sah! 
There are many miles of them just 
below this settlement. A guide 
could be found — ” 

“Not interested,” Cochenour 
growled. “Not in anything that 
close.” 

“Sah?” 

“If a guide can lead us through 
them,” Cochenour explained, 
“they’ve all been explored. Which 
means they’ve been looted. What’s 
the fun of that?” 

“Of course,” said Vastra imme- 
diately. “I see what you’re driving 
at, sah.” He looked happier. I could 



feel his radar reaching out to make 
sure I was listening, though he 
didn’t look in my direction at all. 
“To be sure,” he said, “there is al- 
ways the chance of finding new 
digs, sah, provided one knows 
where to look. Am I correct in as- 
suming that this would interest 
you?” 

The third of Vastra’s house 
brought me my drink and a thin 
powderfaxed slip of paper. “Thirty 
per cent,” I whispered to her. “Tell 
Sub. Only no bargaining, no getting 
anybody else to bid — ” She nodded 
and winked. She had been listening, 
too, and she was as sure as I that 
this Terry was firmly on the hook. 
It had been my intention to nurse 
the drink as long as I could, but 
prosperity loomed before me. I was 
ready to celebrate. I took a long 
happy swallow. 

But the hook didn’t have a barb. 
Unaccountably the Terry shrugged. 
“Waste of time, I bet,” he grum- 
bled. “I mean, really. If you knew 
where to look — why wouldn’t you 
have looked there already?” • 
“Ah, mister,” cried Subhash 
Vastra, “but there are hundreds of 
tunnels not explored! Thousands! 
And in them, who knows? Treas- 
ures beyond price!” 

Cochenour shook his head. “Skip 
it,” he said. “Bring us another 
drink. And see if you can’t get the 
ice cold this time.” 

S OMEWHAT shaken, I put 
down my drink and looked at 
the facsimile copy of Sub’s report 
on them to see if it could tell me 
why Cochenour had lost interest. 

It couldn’t. It did tell me a lot, 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS

though. The girl with Cochenour 
was named Dorotha Keefer. She 
had been traveling with him for a 
couple of years. This was their first 
time off Earth. There was no indi- 
cation that they were married or 
intended to marry. She was in her 
early twenties — real age, not simu- 
lated by drugs ana transplants. 
Cochenour was well over ninety. 

He did not, of course, look any- 
where near that. He moved lightly 
and easily for a big man. His 
money came from land and petro- 
foods — according to the synoptic 
on him, he had been one of the 
first oil millionaires to switch from 
fossil fuels to food production, 
growing algae in the crude that 
came out of his wells and selling 
the algae in processed form for 
human consumption. So he had 
stopped being a mere millionaire 
and turned into something much 
bigger. 

And that accounted for the way 
he looked. He had been on Full 
Medical, with extras. The report 
said his heart was titanium and 
plastic. His lungs had been trans- 
planted from a twenty-year-old 
killed in a copter crash. His skin, 
muscles and fats — not to mention 
his various glandular systems — 
were sustained by hormones and 
cell-builders at what had to be a 
cost well over a thousand dollars a 
day. To judge by the way he 
stroked the girl sitting next to him, 
he was getting his money’s worth. 
He looked and acted no more than 
forty at most — except perhaps for 
the expression in his pale-blue, 
diamond-bright, weary and disil- 
lusioned eyes. 



What a lovely mark! I swallowed 
the rest of my drink and nodded to 
the third for another. There had to 
be a way to get him to charter my 
airbody. 

All I had to do was some figuring. 

Outside the rail of Vastra’s cafe, 
of course, half the Spindle was 
thinking exactly the same thoughts. 
This was the worst of the low sea- 
son — the Hohmann crowd was still 
three months in the future and all of 
us were beginning to run low on 
money. My liver transplant was just 
a Httle extra incentive. Of the hun- 
dred maze runners I could see out 
of the corner of my eye ninety-nine 
needed to cut in on this rich tour- 
ist’s money as much as I did— just 
to stay alive. 

We couldn’t all do it. Two of us, 
three, maybe even a half-dozen 
could score enough to make a real 
difference. No more than that. And 
I had to be one of those few. 

I took a deep swallow of my sec- 
ond drink, tipped Vastra’s third 
lavishly— and conspicuously — and 
turned idly until I was facing Coch- 
enour and his woman dead on. 

The girl was talking with a knot 
of souvenir vendors, looking inter- 
ested and uncertain. “Boyce?” she 
asked over her shoulder. 

“Yeah?” 

“What’s this thing for?” 

He bent over the rail and peered. 
“Looks like a fan,” he said. 

“Heechee prayer fan, right,” 
cried the dealer. I knew him, 
Booker Allemang, an old-timer in 
the Spindle. “Found it myself, 
miss. It will grant your every wish. 
I get letters every day from people

IF 




reporting miraculous results — ” 
“Sucker bait,” grumbled Coche- 
nour. “Buy it if you want.” 

“But what does it do?” 

He laughed raucously. “What 
any fan does. It cools you off.” And 
he looked at me, grinning. 

FINISHED my drink, nodded, 
stood up and walked over to the 
table. “Welcome to Venus,” I said. 
“May I help you?” 

The girl looked at Cochenour 
for approval before she said, “I 
thought this was very pretty 7* 
“Very pretty,” I agreed. “Are 
you familiar with the story of the 
Heechees?” 

Cochenour pointed to a chair. 
I sat and went on. “They built these 
tunnels about a quarter-million 
years ago. They lived here for a 
couple of centuries, give or take a 
lot. Then they went away again. 
They left a lot of junk behind and 
some stuff that isn’t junk. Among 
the things they left are a lot of these 
fans. Some local conman like Bee- 
Gee here got the idea of calling 
them ‘prayer fans’ and selling them 
to tourists to make wishes with.” 
Allemang had been hanging on 
my every word, trying to guess 
where I was going. “You know it’s 
right,” he said. 

“You two are too smart for that 
kind of come-on,” 1 told the Ter- 
rans. “Still, look at the things. 
They’re pretty enough to be worth 
having even without the story.” 
“Absolutely!” cried Allemang. 
“See how this one sparkles, miss! 
And the black and gray crystal, 
how nice it looks with your fair 
hair!” 



The girl unfurled the crystalline 
one. It came rolled like a diploma, 
only cone-shaped. The slightest 
pressure of the thumb kept it open 
and it really was very pretty as she 
waved it gently. Like all the Hee- 
chee fans, it weighed only about ten 
grams, and its lattice caught the 
lights from the luminous Heechee 
walls and from the fluorescents and 
gas tubes and tossed them back in 
iridescent sparks. 

“This fellow’s name is Booker 
Garey Allemang,” I said. “He’ll 
sell you the same goods as any of 
the others, but he won’t cheat you 
as much as most of them.” 
Cochenour looked at me dourly, 
then beckoned Sub Vastra for an- 
other round of drinks. “All right,” 
he said. “If we buy we’ll buy from 
you, Booker Garey Allemang. But 
not now.” He turned to me. “And 
what do you want to sell me?” 
“Myself and my airbody, if you 
want to go looking for new tunnels. 
We’re both as good as you can 
get.” 

“How much?” 

“One million dollars,” I said 
immediately. “All found.” 

He didn’t answer at once, though 
it gave me come pleasure to notice 
that the price didn’t seem to scare 
him. He looked as pleasant — or 
anyway as unangrily bored as ever. 
“Drink up,” he said as Vastra and 
his third served us. Cochenour ges- 
tured with his glass at the Spindle. 
“Know what this was for?” 

“You mean why the Heechees 
built it? No. They were pretty 
small, so it wasn’t for headroom. 
And it was entirely empty when it 
was found.” 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS

He gazed tolerantly at the busy 
scene, alcoves cut into the sloping 
sides of the Spindle featured eating 
and drinking places like Vastra’s or 
souvenir booths, most of them 
empty at this idle season. But there 
were a couple of hundred maze 
rats around — their number had 
been quietly growing all the while 
Cochenour and the girl had been 
sitting there. 

He said, “Not much to see here, 
huh? A hole in the ground and a lot 
of people trying to take my money 
away from me.” 

I shrugged. 

He grinned again. “So why did I 
come? Well, that’s a good question, 
but since you didn’t ask it I don’t 
have to answer it. You want a mil- 
lion dollars. Let’s see. A hundred K 
to charter an airbody. A hundred 
and eighty or so to rent equipment, 
per week. Ten days minimum, three 
weeks a safer guess. Food, supplies, 
permits, another fifty K. So we’re 
up to close to seven hundred thou- 
sand, not counting your own salary 
and what you give our host here as 
his cut for not throwing you off the 
premises. Right, Walt hers?” 

So he even knew my name. I 
had a little difficulty swallowing the 
drink I had been holding to my 
mouth, but 1 managed to say, 
“Close enough, Mr. Cochenour.” 
1 didn’t see any point in telling him 
that I already owned the equipment 
as well as the airbody — I wouldn’t 
have been in the least surprised to 
find out that he knew that, too. 

“You’ve got a deal, then. And I 
want to leave as soon as possible, 
which sould be about this time 
tomorrow.” 



“Fair enough,” I said and stood 
up, avoiding Sub Vastra’s thunder- 
stricken expression. I had some 
work to do and a little thinking. 
He had caught me off base, which is 
a bad place to be unless you can 
afford mistakes. 

My having called him by name 
had been all right — he would have 
known in any case that I had 
checked him out before the Gagarin 
had set down. But it was a little 
surprising that he had known mine. 

Ill 

T HE first thing I had to do was 
double-check my equipment. 
The second was to go to the local, 
validate a contract and settle up 
with Sub Vastra. The third was to 
see my doctor. The liver hadn’t 
been giving me much trouble for a 
while, but then I hadn’t been drink- 
ing grain alcohol for a while. 

It took about an hour to make 
sure that everything we would need 
for the expedition was i.s., with all 
the spare parts I could reasonably 
fear I might need. The Quackery 
was on my way to the union office, 
so I stopped there first. The check- 
out didn’t take long. The news was 
no worse than I had been ready for. 
Dr. Morius studied the readout 
from his instruments carefully and 
sold me a hundred and fifty dollars’ 
worth of guarded hope that I would 
survive three weeks away from his 
office, provided I took all the stuff 
he gave me and wandered no more, 
than usual from his dietary restric- 
tions. 

“And when I get back?” I asked. 
“About the same, Audee,” he said 



72 



IF 




cheerily. “Total collapse in — ah — 
oh, maybe ninety more days.” He 
patted his fingertips. “I hear you’ve 
got a live one. Want me to book 
you for a transplant?” 

“How live did you hear he was?” 

1 asked. 

“Oh, the price is the same in any 
case,” he told me good-humoredly. 
“Two hundred K, plus the hospital, 
anesthesiologist, pre-op psychia- 
trist, pharmaceuticals — you’ve al- 
ready got the figures.” 

I did have them and knew that 
with what 1 might make from 
Cochenour, plus what I had put 
away, plus a small loan on the air- 
body, I could just about meet the 
total. To do so left me broke 
but, of course, alive. 

“Go ahead,” I said. “Three 
weeks from tomorrow.” And I 
left him looking mildly pleased, 
like a Burmese hydro-rice man 
watching another crop being har- 
vested. Dear daddy. Why hadn’t he 
sent me through medical school 
instead of giving me an education? 

I T WOULD have been nice if the 
Heechee had been the same 
size as human beings, instead of 
being about forty per cent shorter. 
In the smaller tunnels, like the one 
that led to the Local 88 office, I 
had to crouch all the way. 

The deputy organizer was waiting 
for me. He had one of the few good 
jobs that didn’t depend on the 
tourists, at least not directly. He 
said, “Subhash Vastra’s been on 
the line. He says you agreed to 
thirty per cent — and besides, you- 
forgot to pay your bar bill to the 
third of his house.” 



“Admitted, both ways.” 

“And you owe me a little, too, 
Audee. Three hundred for a pow- 
derfax copy of my report on your 
pigeon. A hundred for validating 
your contract with Vastra. And if 
you want guide’s papers, sixteen 
hundred for that.” 

I gave him my credit card and he 
checked the total out of my account 
into the local’s. Then I signed and 
card-stamped the contract he had 
drawn up. Vastra’s percentage 
would not be on the whole million- 
dollar gross, but on my net — even 
so, he might make as much out of 
the deal as I would, as least in 
liquid cash, because I’d have to pay 
off all the outstanding balances on 
equipment and loans. The factors 
would carry a man until he scored, 
but then they wanted to get paid. 
They knew how long it might be 
before he scored again. 

“Thanks, Audee,” said the 
deputy, nodding over the signed 
contract. “Anything else I can do 
for you?” 

“Not at your prices,” I told him. 
“Ah, you’re putting me on. 
‘Boyce Cochenour and Dorotha 
Keefer, Earth-Ohio, traveling 
S. V. Yuri Gagarin , Odessa regis- 
try, chartered. No other passen- 
gers.’ No other passengers,” he 
repeated, quoting from the synoptic 
report he’d furnished. “Why, you’ll 
be a rich man, Audee, if you work 
this pigeon right.” 

“That’s more than I ask,” I told 

him. “All I want is to be a living 

___ ” 

one. 

That was not entirely true. I did 
have some little hope — not much, 
not enough to talk about and, in 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



73 




fact, I had never said a word about 
it to anyone — that I might be com- 
ing out of this rather better than 
merely alive. 

There was, however, a problem. 

In the standard guide’s contract 
and airbody leasing terms it says I 
get my money and that’s all. If we 
take a mark like Cochenour on a 
hunt for new Heechee tunnels and 
he finds something valuable — 
marks have scored you know; not 
often, but enough times to keep 
them hopeful the prize is his. We 
just work for him. 

On the other hand, I could go out 
prospecting by myself at any time 
and anything I found would be all 
mine. 

Obviously anybody with any 
sense would go by himself if he 
thought he was really going to find 
anything. But in my case, that 
wasn’t such a good idea. If I staked 
myself to a trip and lost I hadn't 
just wasted time and maybe fifty K 
in supplies and wear and tear. If I 
lost I was dead. 

I needed what I would make out 
of Cochenour to stay alive. 
Whether we found anything inter- 
esting or not, my fee would take 
care of the transplant. 

Unfortunately for my peace of 
mind I had a notion that I knew 
where something very interesting 
might be found — and my problem 
was that as long as I had an all- 
rights contract with Cochenour I 
couldn’t afford to find it. 

T HE next stop I made was in my 
sleeping room. Under the bed, 
keystoned into the rock, was a 
guaranteed break-proof safe that 



held some papers I wanted to have 
in my pocket from then on. 

When I had first come down on 
Venus I had not been interested in 
the scenery. I had wanted to make 
my fortune. 

I didn’t see much of the surface 
of Venus then— or for nearly two 
years after that. You don’t see 
much in the kind of spacecraft that 
can land on Venus — a 20,000- 
millibar surface pressure means 
you need something a little more 
rugged than the bubble ships that 
go to the Moon or Mars or farther 
out. There’s not much tolerance in 
the design for putting unnecessary 
windows into the hull. It didn’t 
matter much, because everything 
worth seeing on Venus is in Venus 
— and all of it once belonged to the 
Heechees. 

Not that we know much about 
the Heechees. We don’t even rightly 
know their name — heechee is how 
somebody once wrote down the 
sound that a fire-pearl makes when 
you stroke it. That has remained 
the only sound connected with the 
Venusian diggers that anybody 
knows. 

The Hesperologists don’t know 
where the Heechees came from, 
although there are some markings 
on scraps of stuff that the Heechees 
used for paper that seem to be a 
star chart, faded, incomplete, 
pretty much unrecognizable — if 
we knew the exact position of every 
star in the galaxy 250,000 years 
ago we might be able to locate them 
from that, I suppose. Assuming 
they originated in this galaxy. 
There are no traces of them any- 
where else in the solar system, 



74 



IF 




except maybe in Phobos. Experts 
still fight about whether the honey- 
comb cells inside the Martian moon 
are natural or artifacts — if they’re 
artifacts they’re, no doubt Heechee. 
But they don’t look much like ours. 

I wonder sometimes what drove 
the Heechees. Had they escaped 
some dying planet? Or come to 
Venus as political refugees? Had 
they been tourists whose transpor- 
tation had broken down between 
somewhere and somewhere and 
who had hung around on Venus just 
long enough to make whatever they 
had to make to get themselves 
going again? I used to think that 
maybe they had come by to watch 
human beings evolving on Earth, 
sort of stepfathers beaming over 
the growing young race — but we 
couldn’t have been much to watch 
during their stay in the neighbor- 
hood. halfway between the Austra- 
lopithecines and the Cro-Magnards. 

They had packed up nearly every- 
thing upon leaving Venus, except 
for a few scraps here and there that 
either hadn’t been worth taking 
along or had been overlooked. All 
those . “prayer fans’’ — enough 

empty containers of one kind or 
another to look like a picnic ground 
at the end of a hard summer — some 
trinkets and trifles. I guess the best 
known of the “trifles’’ was the ani- 
sokinetic punch, the carbon crystal 
that transmitted a blow at a ninety- 
degree angle and made somebody 
a few billion. All the rest of us have 
ever found is junk. 

Did they take all of the good stuff 
with them? I didn’t know, but I did 
think I knew something that could 
have a bearing on the answer. 



I thought I knew where the last 
Heechee ship had taken off from— 
and the spot wasn’t near any of the 
explored diggings. The knowledge 
wasn’t a guarantee of anything, 
but it was something to go on. 
Maybe they had been impatient at 
the end and not so thorough about 
cleaning up. behind themselves. 

And that was what my staying on 
Venus was all about. What other 
possible reason was there for my 
being here? The life of a maze rat 
was marginal at best. It took fifty 
thousand a year to stay alive. If 
you had less than that you couldn’t 
pay air tax, capitation tax, water 
assessment or even buy subsistence- 
level food. If you wanted to eat 
meat more than once a week and 
demanded a cubicle of your own to 
sleep in you needed more. 

Guide’s papers cost a week’s life 
— when any of us bought them, we 
were gambling that week’s cost of 
living against the chance of a big 
enough strike to make it possible 
for us to get back to Earth in the 
style every maze rat had set as his 
goal — with money enough to live 
the full life of a human being on 
Full Medical. 

That was what I wanted. The big 
score. 

N OT by accident, the last thing 
I did that night was visit the 
Hall of Discoveries. 

The third of Vastra’s house 
winked at me over her flirtation veil 
and turned to her companion, who 
looked around and nodded. 

I joined them. “Hello, Mr. Wal- 
thers,’’ she said. 

“I thought I might find you 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS

here,” I said, which was no more 
than the truth, since Vastra’s third 
had promised to guide her this way. 
I didn’t know what to call her. 
Miss Keefer would have been accu- 
rate, Mrs. Cochenour , diplomatic. 
I got around both by asking, 
“Since we’ll be seeing a lot of each 
other, how about getting on to 
first names?” 

“Audee, is it?” 

1 gave her a twelve-tooth smile. 
“Swede on my mother’s side, old 
Texan on my father’s. Name’s been 
in his family a long time, I guess.” 

The Hall of Discoveries was 
meant to get Terry prospects hotted 
up. It held a little of everything 
from charts of the worked diggings 
and a full-scale Mercator map of 
Venus to samples of all the princi- 
pal finds. I showed her the copy of 
the anisokinetic punch and the 
original solid-state piezophone that 
had made its discoverer almost 
as permanently rich as the guy who 
found the punch. Also displayed 
were about a dozen fire-pearls, 
quarter-inch jobbies, behind armor 
glass, on cushions, blazing away 
with their cold milky light. 

“They’re pretty,” she said. “But 
why all the protection? I saw bigger 
ones lying on a counter in the Spin- 
dle without anybody even watching 
them.” 

“That’s a little different, Doro- 
tha,” I told her. “These are real.” 

She laughed out loud. It was a 
very nice laugh. No girl is beautiful 
when she’s laughing hard and girls 
who worry about looking beautiful 
don’t do it. Dorotha Keefer looked 
like a healthy, pretty girl having a 
good time, which is about the best 



way for a pretty girl to look. 

She did not, however, look good 
enough to come between me and a 
new liver, so I took my mind off 
that aspect of her and put it on 
business. “The little red marbles 
over there are blood-diamonds,” I 
told her. “They’re radioactive and 
stay warm. Which is one way you 
can tell the real from the fake — also 
anything over about three centime- 
ters is a fake. A real one that big 
generates too much heat — square- 
cube law, you know — and melts.” 
“So the ones your friend was try- 
ing to sell me — ” 

“—are fakes. Right.” 

She nodded, still smiling. “What 
about what you were trying to sell 
us, Audee? Real or fake?” 

The third of Vastra’s house had 
discreetly vanished. Dorotha and I 
stood alone in the Hall of Discov- 
eries. I took a deep breath and told 
her the truth. Not the whole truth, 
maybe — but nothing but the truth. 

“All this stuff,” I said, “is what 
came from a hundred years of dig- 
ging. And it’s not much. The punch, 
the piezophone and two or three 
other gadgets that we can make 
work, a few busted pieces of things 
that they’re still studying, some 
trinkets. That’s all.” 

She said, “That was how I heard 
it. And one more thing. None of the 
discovery dates on these things is 
less than fifty years old.” 

She was smart and better in- 
formed than I had expected. “And 
the conclusion,” I agreed, “is that 
the planet has been mined dry. 
You’re right — on the evidence. The 
first diggers found everything there 
was to be found — so far.”

IF 




“You think there’s more?” 

“I hope there’s more. Look. 
Item: the tunnels. You can see 
they’re all alike. The blue walls are 
perfectly smooth. The light coming 
from them never varies. Their hard- 
ness is consistent. How do you sup- 
pose they were made?” 

“Why, I don’t know.” 

“Neither do I. Or anybody else. 
But every Heechee tunnel is the 
same and if you dig into any one of 
them from the outside you find the 
basic substrate rock, then a boun- 
dary layer that’s sort of half wall- 
stuff and half substrate, then the 
wall. Conclusion: the Heechees 
didn’t dig the tunnels and then line 
them — they had something that 
crawled around underground like 
an earthworm, leaving these tunnels 
behind. And one other thing — they 
overdug. That’s to say they dug 
tunnels they didn’t need, lots of 
them, going nowhere, never used 
for anything. Does that suggest 
anything to you?” 

“The process must have been 
cheap and easy?” she guessed. 

I nodded. “So it was probably 
done by a machine — and there 
really ought to be at least one of 
their machines left somewhere on 
this planet. Next item: the air. 
They breathed oxygen as we do and 
they must have gotten it from 
somewhere. Where?” 

“Why, there’s oxygen in the at- 
mosphere — ” 

“Sure. About a half of one per 
cent. And better than ninety-five 
per cent carbon dioxide. Somehow 
they managed to get that half of 
one per cent out of the mixture 
cheaply and easily — remember 

THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



those extra tunnels they filled — 
along with enough nitrogen or some 
other inert gas to make a breathing 
mixture. If there’s a machine that 
did it I’d like to find that machine. 
Next item: aircraft. The Heechee 
flew around the surface of Venus at 
will.” 

“So do you, Audee. Aren’t you a 
pilot?” 

“Sure, but look at what it takes. 
The surface temperature is two- 
seventy C and there’s not enough 
oxygen to keep a cigarette going. 
So my airbody has two fuel tanks, 
one for hydrocarbons, one for oxi- 
dants. And — did you ever hear of 
a fellow named Carnot?” 

“Old-time scientist, was he? The 
Carnot cycle?” 

“Right again.” That was the 
third time she’d surprised me, I 
noted cautiously. “The Carnot 
efficiency of an engine is expressed 
by its maximum temperature — the 
heat of combustion, let’s say — over 
the temperature of its exhaust. 
Well, but the temperature of the ex- 
haust can’t be less than the temper- 
ature of what it flows into — other- 
wise you’re not running an engine, 
you’re running a refrigerator. And 
you’ve got that two-seventy am- 
bient air temperature — so you have 
basically a lousy engine. Any heat 
engine on Venus is lousy. Did you 
ever wonder why there are so few 
airbodies around? I don’t mind — it 
helps to have something close to a 
monopoly. But the reason is they’re 
so damn expensive to run.” 

“And the Heechees flew more 
efficiently?” 

“I think they did.” 

She laughed again, unexpectedly 

77 




and once more very attractively. 
“Why, you poor fellow,” she said in 
good humor. “You’re hooked on 
the stuff you sell, aren’t you? You 
think that some day you’re going 
to find the mother tunnel and pick 
up all this stuff.” 

I wasn’t too pleased with the way 
things were going. I had arranged 
with Vastra’s third to bring the 
girl here, away from her boy friend, 
so I could pick her brains in pri- 
vate. It hadn’t worked out my way. 
She was making me aware of her as 
a person, which was a bad develop- 
ment in itself. But even worse, she 
was making me take a good look at 
myself. 

I said after a minute, “You may 
be right. But I’m sure going to give 
it a good try.” 

“You’re angry, aren’t you?” 
“No,” I said, lying. “But maybe 
a little tired. And we’ve got a long 
trip tomorrow, so I’d better take 
you home. Miss Keefer.” 

IV 

M Y AIRBODY lay on the 
spacepad. It was reached 
by elevator to the surface lock, a 
tractor-cab to carry us across the 
dry, tortured surface of Venus, 
peeling under the three hundred 
kmh wind. Normally I kept the 
ship under a foam housing. You 
don’t leave anything free and 
exposed on the surface of Venus 
if you want to keep it intact, not 
even if it’s made of chrom^ steel. 
I had had the foam stripped free 
when I checked out the machine 
and loaded supplies that morning. 
Now it was ready. I could see it 



from the bull’s-eye ports of the 
crawler, through the green-yellow 
murk outside. Cochenour and the 
girl could have seen it, too, if they 
had known where to look, but they 
might not have recognized it. 

Cochenour screamed in my ear, 
“You and Dorrie have a fight?” 

“No fight,” I screamed back. 

“Don’t care if you did. You 
don’t have to like each other, just 
do what I want you to do.” He was 
silent a moment, resting his throat. 
“Jesus. What a wind.” 

“Zephyr,” I told him. I didn’t 
say any more — he would find out 
for himself. Around the spacepad 
is a sort of natural calm area — by 
Venusian standards. Orographic 
lift throws the meanest winds up 
over the pad and all we get is a sort 
of confused back eddy. The good 
part is that taking off and landing 
are relatively easy. The bad part is 
that some of the heavy metal com- 
pounds in the atmosphere settle on 
the pad.. What passes for air on 
Venus has layers of red mercuric 
sulfide and mercurous chloride in 
the lower reaches, and when you 
get above them to those pretty 
fluffy clouds you find some of 
them are hydrochloric and hydro- 
fluoric acid. 

Navigation over Venus is 3-D. 
It’s easy enough to proceed from 
point to point; your transponders 
will link you to the radio range and 
map your position continuously 
onto the charts. What’s hard is to 
find the right altitude — and that 
was why my airbody and I were 
worth a million dollars to 
Cochenour. 

We were at the airbody, and the 



78 



IF 




telescoping snout from the crawler 
was poking out to its lock. Coche- 
nour was staring through the 
bull’s-eye. 

“No wings?” he shouted, as 
though I were cheating him. 

“No sails or snow chains either,” 
I shouted back. “Get aboard if 
you want to talk. It’s easier in the 
airbody.” 

We climbed through the little 
snout. I unlocked the entrance and 
we got aboard without much 
trouble. 

We didn’t even have the kind of 
trouble that I might have made. 
You see, an airbody is a big thing 
on Venus. I was damn lucky to have 
been able to acquire one and — 
well, I won’t beat about the bush: 
you could say I loved it. Mine 
could have held ten people, without 
equipment. With what Sub Vastra’s 
purchasing department had sold 
us and Local 88 had certified as 
essential aboard, it was crowded 
with just the three of us. 1 was 
prepared for sarcasm, at least. But 
Cochenour merely looked around 
long enough to find the best bunk, 
strode over to it and declared it his. 
The girl was a good sport and there 
I was, left with my glands all 
charged up for an argument and 
no argument. 

It was a lot quieter inside the 
airbody. You could hear the noise 
of the wind right enough, but it 
was only annoying. I passed out 
earplugs and with them in place 
the noise was hardly even annoying. 

“Sit down and strap up,” I 
ordered and when they were stowed 
away I took off. 

At twenty thousand millibars 



wings aren’t just useless— they’re 
poison. My airbody had all the lift 
it needed built into the seashell- 
shaped hull. I fed the double fuels 
into the thermojets — we bounced 
across the reasonably flat ground 
around the spacepad (it was bull- 
dozed once a week) and we were 
zooming off into the wild yellow- 
green yonder, an instant later the 
wild brown-gray yonder, after a 
run of no more than fifty meters. 

Cochenour had fastened his 
harness loosely for comfort. I en- 
joyed hearing him yell as he was 
thrown about. That fun didn’t last. 
At the thousand-meter level I found 
Venus’s semi-permanent atmo- 
sheric inversion, and the turbulence 
dropped to where I could take off 
my belt and stand. 

1 took the plugs out of my ears 
and motioned to Cochenour and 
the girl to do the same. 

He was grinning a little and 
rubbing his head where he’d 
bounced into an overhead chart 
rack. “Pretty exciting,” he con- 
ceded, fumbling in his pocket. Then . 
he remembered to ask. “Is it all 
right if I smoke?” 

“They’re your lungs.” 

He grinned more widely. “They 
are now,” he agreed and lit up. 
“Say. Why didn’t you give us those 
plugs while we were in the tractor?” 

T HERE is, you might say, a 
tide in the affairs of guides — 
they can ride it or be swamped. 

I could either let my tourists flood 
me with questions and spend the 
whole time explaining what that 
funny little dial means or I could 
go on to do my work and enjoy as 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS

much as I could. It had come to 
this: was I or was 1 not going to 
like Cochenour and his girl friend? 

For the three of us to live for 
three weeks in a space about as 
big as an apartment kitchenette 
meant everybody would have to 
work real hard at being nice to 
everybody else — and since I was 
the one who was being paid to be 
nice I should be the one to set an 
example. On the other hand, the 
Cochenours of the worlds are 
sometimes just not likeable. If 
that was going to be the case, the 
less talk the better — I ought to 
slide off questions like that with 
something like, I forgot . 

But he hadn’t actually been un- 
pleasant and the girl friend had 
tried to be friendly. I said, “Well, 
that’s an interesting thing. You see, 
you hear by differences in pressure. 
While we were taking off, the plugs 
filtered out part of the sound — 
the pressure waves — but when I 
yelled at you to belt up the plugs 
passed the overpressure of my 
voice and you understood it. How- 
ever, there’s a limit. Past about a 
hundred and twenty decibels — 
that’s a unit of sound — ’’ 

Cochenour growled, “I know 
what a decibel is.’’ 

“Right. Past a hundred and 
twenty the eardrum just doesn’t 
respond any more. So in the craw- 
ler it was too loud — with the plugs 
on you wouldn’t have heard 
anything.’’ 

Dorotha had been listening while 
she repaired her eye makeup. 
“What was to hear?’’ 

“Oh,’’ I said, “nothing, really. 
Except, well — ’’ Then I voted to 



think of them as friends, at least 
for the time being. “Except in the 
case of an accident. If we’d had a 
gust, you know, that crawler could 
have flipped right over. Or some- 
times solid objects come flying 
over the hills and into you before 
you know it. Or — ’’ 

She was shaking her head. “I 
understand. Lovely place we’re 
visiting, Boyce.” 

“Yeah. Look,” he said, “who’s 
flying this thing?” 

I got up and activated the virtual 
globe. “That’s what I was just 
coming to. Right now it’s on auto- 
pilot, heading in the general direc- 
tion of this quadrant down here. 
We have to pick out a specific 
destination.” 

“That’s Venus?” the girl asked. 
“It doesn’t look like much.” 

“Those lines are radio-range 
markers — you won’t see them 
through the window. Venus doesn’t 
have any oceans and it isn’t cut up 
into nations, so a map of it isn’t 
like Earth’s. That bright spot is 
us. Now look.” I overlaid the radio- 
range grid and the contour colors 
with mascon markings. “Those 
blobby circles are mascons. You 
know what a mascon is?” 

“A concentration of mass. A 
lump of heavy stuff,” offered the 
girl. 

“Fine. Now look at the known 
Heechee digs.” I phased them in as 
golden patterns. 

“They’re all in the mascons,” 
Dorothea said at once. Cochenour 
gave her a look of tolerant approval. 

“Not all. Look over here — this 
little one isn’t, nor is this one. But 
damn near all. Why? I don’t know. 



80 



IF 




Nobody knows. The mass concen- 
trations are mostly older, denser 
rock— basalt and so on. Maybe 
the Heechee found it easier to dig 
in. Or maybe they just liked it.” 
In my correspondence with Profes- 
sor Hegramet back on Earth — in 
the days when I didn’t have a dying 
liver in my gut and took an interest 
in abstract knowledge — he and 1 
had kicked around the possibility 
that the Heechee digging machines 
would only work in dense rock or 
rock of a certain chemical compo- 
sition. But I wasn’t prepared to dis- 
cuss that with Cochenour. 

“See over here, where we are now 
— ” I rotated the virtual globe 
slightly by turning a dial — “that’s 
the big dig we just came out of. 
You can see the shape of the 
Spindle. It’s a common shape, by 
the way. You can see it in some 
of the others if you look — and 
there are digs where it doesn’ 
show on these tracings but it’s 
there if you’re on the spot. That 
particular mascon where the 
Spindle lies is called Serendip. It 
was discovered by accident by a 
Hesperological — ” 

“Hesperological?” 

“ — a geological team operating 
on Venus, which makes it a Hes- 
perological team. They were dril- 
ling out core samples and hit the 
Heechee digs. Now these other 
digs in the northern high-latitudes 
you see are all in one bunch of 
associated mascons. They connect 
through interventions of less dense 
rock, but only where absolutely 
necessary.” 

Cochenour said sharply, “They’re 
north and we’re going south. Why?” 



It was interesting that he could 
read the navigation instruments, 
but I didn’t say so. I only said, 
“They’re no good. They’ve been 
probed.” 

“They look even bigger than the 
Spindle.” 

“Hell of a lot bigger, right. But 
there’s nothing much in them, or 
anyway not much chance that 
anything in them is in good enough 
shape to bother with. Subsurface 
fluids filled them up a hundred 
thousand years ago, maybe more. 
A lot of good men have gone broke 
trying to pump and excavate them 
without finding anything. Ask me. 
I was one of them.” 

“I didn’t know there was any 
liquid water on Venus or under it,” 
Cochenour objected. 

“I didn’t say water, did I? But 
as a matter of fact some of it was 
water — or anyway a sort of oozy 
mud. Apparently water cooks out 
of the rocks and has a transit time 
to the surface of some thousands 
of years before it seeps out, boils 
off and cracks to hydrogen and 
oxygen and gets lost. In case you 
didn’t know it, there’s some under 
the Spindle. It’s what you wefe 
drinking and what you were 
breathing.” 

The girl said, “Boyce* this is all 
very interesting, but I’m hot and 
dirty. Can I change the subject for 
a minute?” 

Cochenour barked — it wasn’t 
really a laugh. “Subliminal prompt- 
ing, Walthers, you agree? And a 
little old-fashioned prudery, too, 
I expect. What she really wants 
to do is go to the bathroom.” 

Given a little encouragement 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



81 




from the girl, I would have been 
mildly embarrassed for her, but 
she only said, “If we’re going to 
live in this thing for three weeks 
I’d like to know what it offers.’’ 
I said, “Certainly, Dorotha.’’ 
“Dorrie, if you like it better.” 
“Sure, Dorrie. Well, you see 
what we’ve got. Five bunks — they 
partition to sleep ten if wanted, 
but we don’t want. Two shower 
stalls. They don’t look big enough 
to soap yourself in, but they are 
if you work at it. Three chemical 
toilets. Kitchen over there — well. 
Pick the bunk you like, Dorrie. 
There’s a screen arrangement that 
comes down when you want it for 
changing clothes and so on — or 
just if you don’t want to look at the 
rest of us for a while.” 

Cochenour said, “Go on, Dorrie, 
do what you want to do. I want 
Walthers to show me how to fly 
this thing.” 

I T WASN’T a bad start. I’ve 
had some traumatic times with 
parties that came aboard drunk 
and steadily got drunker, couples 
who fought every waking minute 
and got together only to hassle me. 
This one didn’t look bad at all, 
even apart from the fact that it 
was going to save my life for me. 

There’s not much to flying an 
airbody, at least as far as making 
it move the way you want it to is 
concerned. On Venus the atmos- 
phere has lift to spare. You don’t 
worry about things like stalling 
out — and anyway the autonomic 
controls do most of your thinking 
for you. 

Cochenour learned fast. It turned 



out he had flown everything that 
moved on Earth and had also 
operated one-man submersibles. 
He understood as soon as I men- 
tioned it to him that the hard part 
of pilotage was selecting the right 
flying level and anticipating when 
you’d have to change it, but he 
also understood that he wasn’t 
going to learn that in one day. Or 
even in three weeks. 

“What the hell, Walthers,” he 
said cheerfully enough. “At least 
I can make it go where I have to, 
in case you get caught in a tunnel 
or shot by a jealous husband.” 
I gave him the smile his pleas- 
antry was worth, which wasn’t 
much. “The other thing I can do,” 
he said, “is cook. Unless you’re 
really good at it? No, I thought 
not. Well, I paid too much for this 
stomach to fill it with hash, so I’ll 
make the meals. That’s a little 
skill Dorrie never got around to 
learning. Same with her grand- 
mother. Most beautiful woman in 
the world, but had the idea that 
was all there was to it.” 

I put that aside to sort out later. 
He was full of little unexpected 
things, this ninety-year-old young 
athlete. He said, “All right, now 
while Dorrie’s using up all the 
water in the shower — ” 

“Not to worry — it all recycles.” 
“Anyway. While she’s cleaning 
up, finish your little lecture on 
where we’re going.” 

“Right.” I spun the virtual globe 
a little. The bright spot that was 
us had already moved a dozen 
degrees. “See that cluster where 
our track intersects those grid 
marks?” 



82 



IF 




“Yeah. Five big mascons close 
together and no diggings indicated. 
Is that where we’re going?” 

“In a general sense, yes.” 

“Why in a general sense?” 
“Well,” I said, “there’s one 
little thing I didn’t tell you. I’m 
assuming you won’t jump salty 
over it, because then I’ll have to 
get salty, too, and tell you you 
should have taken the trouble to 
learn more about Venus before 
you decided to explore it.” 

He studied me appraisingly for 
a moment. Dorrie came quietly out 
of the shower in a long robe, her 
hair in a towel, and stood near 
him, watching. 

“It depends on what you didn’t 
tell me,” he said. 

“There’s a no-trespassing sign 
on most of those mascons,” I 
said. I activated the pilotage chart 
overlay and bright, cherry-red 
warning lines sprang up all around 
the cluster. 

“That’s the south polar security 
area,” I said. “That’s where the 
Defense boys keep the missile 
range and the biggest part of their 
weapons development areas. And 
we’re not allowed to enter.” 

He said harshly, “But there’s 
only a little piece of one mascon 
that isn’t off limits.” 

“And that’s where we’re going,” 
I said. 

V 

F OR a man more than ninety 
years old Boyce Cochenour was 
spry. I don’t mean just healthy 
looking. Full Medical will do a 
lot for you — you simply replace 



whatever wears out or begins to 
look shopworn and tatty. You 
cannot, however, very well replace 
the' brain, so what you usually see 
in the very rich old ones is a 
bronzed, strong body that shakes 
and hesitates and drops things 
and stumbles. About that Coche- 
nour had been very lucky. 

He was going to be wearing 
company for three weeks. He had 
insisted 1 show him how to pilot 
the airbody. When I decided to use 
a little flight time to give the cool- 
ing system a somewhat premature 
thousand-hour check, he helped me 
pull the covers, check the refrig- 
erant levels and clean the filters. 
Then he decided to cook us lunch. 

The girl took over as my helper 
while I restowed some of the sup- 
plies to get out the autosonic 
probes. At the steady noise level 
of the inside of an airbody our nor- 
mal conversational voices wouldn’t 
carry to Cochenour, less than three 
meters away, and I thought of 
pumping her about him. I decided 
against it. What I didn’t know 
bothered only my curiosity. I 
already knew he was paying me the 
price of a new liver. I didn’t need 
to know what he and the girl 
thought about when they thought 
about each other. 

So our conversation was along 
the lines of how the probes would 
fire charges and time the echoes 
and what the chances were of 
finding something really good 
(“Well, what are the chances of 
winning a sweepstakes? Bad for 
any individual who buys a ticket — 
but there’s always one winner 
somewhere — ”) and what had 



THEMERCHANTS OF VENUS

made me come to Venus in the first 
place. 1 mentioned my father’s 
name, but she had never heard of 
him. Too young, for one thing, 
no doubt. And she was bom and 
bred in Southern Ohio, where 
Cochenour had worked as a kid 
and where he had returned as a 
billionaire. He had been building 
a new processing center there and 
it had been a lot of headaches — 
trouble with the unions, trouble 
with the banks, trouble, bad 
trouble, with the government — 
so he had decided to take a few 
months off and loaf. 

I looked over to where he was 
stirring up a sauce and said, “He 
loafs harder than anybody else 
I ever saw.’’ 

“He’s a work addict. I imagine 
that’s how he got rich in the first 
place — ’’ 

The airbody lurched and I 
dropped everything to jump for 
the controls. I heard Cochenour 
howl behind me, but I was busy 
locating the right transit level. 
By the time I had climbed a 
thousand meters and reset the auto- 
pilot he was rubbing his wrist and 
glowering at me. 

“Sorry,’’ I said. 

He said dourly, “I don’t mind 
your scalding the skin off my arm 
— I can always buy more skin — 
but you nearly made me spill the 
gravy.’’ 

I checked the virtual globe. The 
bright marker was two-thirds of the 
way to our destination. “Is it 
about ready?’’ I asked. “We’ll 
be there in an hour?’’ 

For the first time he looked 
startled. “So soon? I thought you 



said this thing was subsonic.” 

“I did. You’re on Venus, Mr. 
Cochenour. At this level the speed 
of sound is maybe five thousand 
kilometers an hour.” 

He looked thoughtful, but all 
he said was, “Well, we can eat any 
minute.” Later, while we were 
finishing up, he said, “I think 
maybe 1 don’t know as much about 
this planet as I might. If you want 
to give us the usual guide’s lecture, 
we’ll listen.” 

I said, “Well, you pretty much 
know the outlines. Say, you’re a 
great cook, Mr. Cochenour. I 
packed all these provisions, but I 
don’t even know what I’m eating.” 
“If you come to my office in 
Cincinatti,” he said, “you can ask 
for Mr. Cochenour, but while we’re 
living in each other’s armpits you 
might as well call me Boyce. And 
if you like it, why aren’t you eating 
it?” 

The answer was: Because it 
might kill me . but I didn’t want 
to get into a discussion that might 
lead to why I needed his fee so 
badly. I said, “Doctor’s orders — 
have to lay off the fats pretty, 
much for a while. I think he thinks 
I’m putting on too much weight.” 
Cochenour looked at me apprais- 
ingly, but only said, “The lecture?” 
“Well, let’s start with the most 
important part,” I said, carefully 
pouring coffee, “While we’re in 
the airbody you can do what you 
like, walk around, eat, drink, 
smoke if you got ’em, whatever. 
The' cooling system is built for 
more than three times as many 
people, plus their cooking and 
appliance loads, with a safety

factor of two. Air and water, 
more than we’d need for two 
months. Fuel, enough for three 
round trips and some maneuvering. 
If anything went wrong we’d yell 
for help and somebody would come 
and get us in a couple of hours at 
most — probably the Defense boys 
and they have supersonic bodies. 
The worst thing would be if the 
hull breached and the whole Ven- 
usian atmosphere tried to come in. 
If it happened fast we’d be dead. 
It never happens fast, though. 
We’d have time to get into suits 
and we can live in them for thirty 
hours. Long before that we’d be 
picked up.” 

“Assuming, of course, that 
nothing went wrong with the radio 
at the same time,” said Cochenour. 

“Right. You can get killed any- 
where if enough accidents happen 
at once.” 

He poured himself another cup 
of coffee, tipped a little brandy into 
it and said, “Go on.” 

“Well, outside the airbody it’s 
a little more tricky. You’ve only 
got the suit and its useful life, as 
I say, is only thirty hours. It’s a 
question of refrigeration. You can 
carry all the air and water you 
want, and you don’t have to worry 
about food, but it takes a lot of 
compact energy to get rid of the 
diffuse energy all around you. It 
takes fuel for the cooling systems 
and when that’s gone you’d better 
be back in the airbody. Heat isn’t 
the worst way to die. You pass 
out before you begin to hurt. But 
the end result is you’re dead. 

“The other thing is — you want 
to check your suit every time you 



put it on. Pressure it up and 
watch the gauge for leaks. Fll 
check it too, but don’t rely on me. 
It’s your life. And the faceplates 
are pretty strong — you can drive 
nails with them without breaking 
them — but they can be broken if 
hit hard enough. That way you’re 
dead, too.” 

Dorrie said quietly, “One 
question. Have you ever lost a 
tourist?” 

“No.” But then I added: “Others 
have. Five or six get killed every 
year.” 

“I don’t mind odds like that,” 
said Cochenour. “Actually that 
wasn’t the lecture I was asking for, 
Audee. I certainly want to hear 
how to stay alive, but I assume you 
would have told us all this before 
we left the ship anyway. What I 
really wanted to know was how 
come you picked this particular 
mascon to prospect.” 

This old geezer with the muscle- 
beach body was beginning to bother 
me. He had a disturbing habit of 
asking the questions I didn’t want 
to answer. There was a reason why 
I had picked this site — it had to do 
with about Five years of study, a 
lot of digging and about a quarter 
of a million dollars’ worth of 
correspondence, at space-mail 
rates, with people like Professor 
Hegramet back on Earth. 

But I didn’t want to tell him all 
of my reasons. There were about a 
dozen sites that I really wanted to 
explore. If this happened to be one 
of the payoff places he would come 
out of it richer than I would — 
the contracts specify 40% to the 
charterer, 25% to the guide, the rest 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



85 




to the government — and that 
should be enough for him. If it 
happened not to pay off, I didn’t 
want him taking some other guide 
to one of the others I had marked. 

So I only said, “Call it an in- 
formed guess. I promised you a 
good shot at a tunnel that’s never 
been opened and I hope to keep 
my promise. And now let’s get the 
food put away. We’re within ten 
minutes of where we’re going.’’ 

W ITH everything strapped 
down and ourselves belted 
up, we dropped out of the relatively 
calm layers into the big winds 
again. 

We were over the big south- 
central massif, about the same ele- 
vation as the lands surrounding 
the Spindle. That’s the elevation 
where most of the action is on 
Venus. Down in the lowlands and 
the deep rift valleys the pressures 
run fifty thousand millibars and up. 
My airbody wouldn’t take any of 
that for very long and neither would 
anybody else’s, except for a few of 
the special research and military 
types. Fortunately the Heechee 
hadn’t cared for the lowlands 
either. Nothing of theirs has ever 
been located much below twenty- 
bar. Doesn’t mean it isn’t there, 
of course. 

Anyway, I verified our position 
on the virtual globe and on the 
detail charts and deployed the 
autosonic probes. The winds threw 
them all over the place as soon as 
they dropped free. It didn’t much 
matter where they went, within 
broad limits, which was a good 
thing. They dropped like javelins 



at first, then flew around like 
straws until the little rockets cut 
in and the ground-seeking controls 
fired them to the ground. 

Every one embedded itself prop- 
erly. It was a good start. 

I checked the position of the 
probes on the detail charts — the 
formation was close enough to an 
equilateral triangle, which was 
about how we wanted them. Then 
I opened the scanning range and 
began circling around. 

“Now what?” bellowed Co- 
chenour. I noticed the girl had put 
the earplugs back on, but he wasn’t 
willing to miss a thing. 

“Now we wait for the probes to 
feel around for Heechee tunnels. 
It’ll take a couple of hours.” While 
I was talking I brought the airbody 
down through the surface layers. 
Now we were being thrown around. 
The buffeting got pretty bad and so 
did the noise. 

But I found what I was looking 
for — a surface formation like a 
blind arroyo — and tuckeo us into 
it with only one or two bad mo- 
ments. Cochenour was watching 
carefully and I grinned to myself. 
This was where pilotage counted, 
not en route or at the prepared pads 
around the Spindle. 

Our position looked all right, so 
I fired four hold-downs, tethered 
stakes with explosive heads that 
opened out in the ground. I winched 
them tight and all of them held. 

That was also a good sign. Rea- 
sonably pleased with myself, I 
opened the belt catches and stood 
up. “We’re here for. at least a day 
or two,” I said. “More if we’re 
lucky. How did you like the ride?” 



86 



IF 




The girl was taking out the ear- 
plugs now that the protecting walls 
of the arroyo had cut the thunder- 
ing down to a mere constant 
scream. “I’m glad I don’t get air- 
sick,” she said. 

Cochenour was thinking, not 
talking. He was studying the con- 
trol board while he lit another 
cigarette. 

Dorotha said, “One question, 
Audee. Why couldn’t we stay up 
where it’s quieter?” 

“Fuel. I carry about thirty hours, 
full thrust, but that’s it. Is the noise 
bothering you.” 

She made a face. 

“You’ll get used to it. It’s like 
living next to a spaceport. At first 
you wonder how anybody stands 
the noise for a single hour. After 
you’ve been there a week you miss 
it if it stops.” 

She moved over to the bull’s-eye 
and gazed pensively out at the 
landscape. We’d crossed into the 
night portion and there wasn’t 
much to see but dust and small 
objects whirling through our ex- 
ternal light beams. “It’s that first 
week that I’m worrying about,” 
she said. 

I flicked on the probe readout. 
The little percussive heads were 
firing their slap-charges and mea- 
suring each other’s sounds, but it 
was too early to see anything. The 
screen was barely beginning to 
build up a shadowy pattern, more 
holes than detail. 

Cochenour finally spoke. “How 
long until you can make some sense 
out of that?” 

Another point: he didn’t ask what 
“that” was. 



“Depends on how close and how 
big anything is. You can make a 
guess in an hour or so, but I like all 
the data I can get. Six or eight 
hours, I’d say. There’s no hurry.” 
He growled, “I’m in a hurry, 
Walthers. Keep that in mind.” 

The girl cut in. “What should we 
do, Audee? Play three-handed 
bridge?” 

“Whatever you want, but I’d 
advise some sleep. I’ve got pills if 
you want them. If we do find any- 
thing — and remember, if we hit on 
the first try it’s just hundred-to-one 
luck — we’ll want to be wide awake 
for a while.” 

“All right,” said Dorotha, reach- 
ing out for the spansules, but Co- 
chenour demanded: 

“What about you?” 

“Pretty soon. I’m waiting for 
something.” He didn’t ask what. 
Probably, I thought, because he 
already knew. I decided that when 
I did hit my bunk I wouldn’t take 
a sleepy pill right away. This Co- 
chenour was not only the richest 
tourist I had ever guided, he was 
one of the best informed. I wanted 
to think about that for a while. 



W HAT I was waiting for took 
almost an hour to come. The 
boys were getting a little sloppy — 
they should have been after us be- 
fore this. 

The radio buzzed and then 
blared: “Unidentified vessel at 

one three Five, zero seven, four 
eight and seven two, five one, five 
four. Please identify yourself and 
state your purpose.” 

Cochenour looked up inquiringly 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS

from his gin game with the girl. 
I smiled reassuringly. “As long as 
they’re saying ‘please’ there’s no 
problem,’’ I told him and opened 
the transmitter. 

“This is Pilot Audee Walthers, 
airbody Poppa Tare Nine One, out 
of the Spindle. We are licensed and 
have filed approved flight plans. 
I have two Terry tourists aboard — 
purpose, recreational exploration.” 

“Acknowledge. Please wait,” 
blared the radio. The military 
always broadcasts at maximum 
gain. Hangover from drill- 
sergeant days, no doubt. 

I turned off the microphone and 
told my passengers, “They’re 
checking our flight plan. Nothing 
to worry about.” 

In a moment the Defense com- 
municator came back, loud as 
ever. “You are eleven point four 
kilometers bearing one eight three 
degrees from terminator of a 
restricted area. Proceed with 
caution. Under Military Regula- 
tions One Seven and One Eight, 
Sections — ” 

I cut in, “I know the drill. I have 
my guide’s license and have ex- 
plained the restrictions to the 
passengers.” 

“Acknowledged,” blared the 
radio. “We will keep you under 
surveillance. If you observe vessels 
or parties on the surface they are 
our perimeter teams. Do not 
interfere with them in any way. 
Respond at once to any request for 
identification or information.” The 
carrier buzz cut off. 

Cochenour said, “They act 
nervous.” 

“No. They’re used to seeing us 



around. They’ve got nothing else 
to do, that’s all.” 

Dorrie said hesitantly, “Audee, 
you told them you’d explained the 
restrictions to us. I don’t remember 
that part.” 

“Oh, I explained them all right. 
We stay out of the restricted area, 
because if we don’t they’ll start 
shooting. That is the Whole of the 
Law.” 

IV 

I SET a wake-up for four hours 
and the others heard me moving 
around and got up, too. Dorrie 
fetched us coffee from the warmer 
and we stood drinking it and look- 
ing at the patterns the computer 
had traced. 

I took several minutes to study 
them, although they were clear 
enough at first look. There were 
eight major anomalies that could 
have been Heechee warrens. One 
was almost right outside our door. 
We wouldn’t even have to move the 
airbody to dig for it. 

I showed them the anomalies, 
one by one. Cochenour just looked 
at them thoughtfully. Dorotha 
asked after a moment, “You mean 
all of these are unexplored 
tunnels?” 

“No. Wish they were. But one, 
any or all of them could have been 
explored by someone who didn’t 
go to the trouble of recording it. 
Two, they don’t have to be tunnels. 
They might be fracture faults or 
dikes or little rivers of some kind 
of molten material that ran out of 
somewhere and hardened and got 
covered more than a billion years

ago. The only thing we know for 
sure so far is that there probably 
aren’t any unexplored tunnels in 
this area except in those eight 
places.” 

“So what do we do?” 

“We dig. And then we see what 
we’ve got.” 

Cochenour said, “Where do we 
dig?” 

I pointed right next to the 
bright delta of our airbody. “Right 
here.” 

“Because it’s the best bet?” 

“Well, not necessarily.” I con- 
sidered what to tell him and decided 
the truth was the best. “There are 
three that look like better bets 
than the others — here, I’ll mark 
them.” I keyed the chart controls 
and the best looking traces im- 
mediately displayed letters A, B 
and C. “/I runs right under the 
arroyo here, so we’ll dig it first.” 

“Those three because they’re 
the brightest?” 

I nodded, somewhat annoyed at 
his quickness, although the 
conclusion was obvious enough. 

“But C over here is the brightest 
of the lot. Why don’t we dig that 
first?” 

I chose my words carefully. 
“Because we would have to move 
the airbody — and because it’s on 
the outside perimeter of the survey 
area. That means the results aren’t 
as reliable as they are for this one 
right under us. But those aren’t 
the most important reasons. The 
most important reason is that 
C is on the edge of the line our 
itchy-fingered friends are telling 
us to stay away from.” 

Cochenour laughed incredu- 



lously. “You mean you’re telling 
me that if you find a real untouched 
Heechee tunnel you’ll stay out of 
it just because some soldier tells 
you it’s a no-no?” 

I said, “The problem doesn’t 
arise just yet — we have seven 
anomalies to look at that are 
legal. Also the military will be 
checking us from time to time, 
particularly in the next day or two.” 
Cochenour insisted, “All right, 
suppose we check them and find 
nothing. What do we do then?” 

I shook my head. “I never 
borrow trouble. Let’s check the 
legal ones.” 

“But suppose.” 

“Damn it, Boyce! How do I 
know?” 

He gave it up then, but winked at 
Dorrie and chuckled. “What did 
I tell you, honey? He’s a bigger 
bandit than I am.” 

F OR the next couple of hours 
we didn’t have much time to 
talk about theoretical possibilities. 
We were too busy with concrete 
facts. 

The biggest fact was an awful 
lot of hot, high-speed gas that we 
had to keep from killing us. My 
own hotsuit was custom made, of 
course, and only needed the fittings 
and tanks to be checked. Boyce and 
the girl had rental units. They’d 
paid top dollar for them and they 
were good, but good isn’t perfect. 
I had them in and out of them a 
dozen times, checking the fit and 
varying tensions until they were 
as right as I could get them. There’s 
a lot of heat and pressure to keep 
out when you go about the surface 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



89 




of Venus. The suits were laminated 
twelve-ply, with nine degrees of 
freedom at the essential joints. They 
wouldn’t fail — that wasn’t what 
I was worried about. What I was 
worried about was comfort, 
because a small itch or rub can 
become serious when there’s no 
way to stop it. 

But finally they were good 
enough for a first trial and we all 
huddled in the lock and exited onto 
the surface of Venus. 

We were still darkside, but there 
was so much scatter from the sun 
that it didn’t get really dark more 
than a quarter of the time. I let 
them practice walking around the 
airbody, leaning into the wind, 
bracing themselves against the 
hold-downs and the side of the 
ship, while I got ready to dig. 

I hauled out our first instant 
igloo, dragged it into position and 
ignited it. As it smoldered it 
puffed up like the children’s toy 
that used to be called a Pharaohs’ 
Serpent, producing a light, tough 
ash that grew up around the digging 
site and joined in a seamless dome 
at the top. I had already emplaced 
the digging torch and the crawl- 
through lock. As the ash grew I 
manhandled the lock to get a close 
union and got a perfect join first 
time. 

Dorrie and Cochenour stayed out 
of the way when they caught sight 
of my waving arm, but hung to- 
gether, watching through their 
triple vision plugs. I keyed on the 
radio. “You want to come in and 
watch as we start it up?” I shouted. 

Inside the helmets they both 
nodded. “Come on, then,” I yelled 



and wiggled through the crawl 
lock. I signaled them to leave it 
open as they followed me in. 

With the three of us and the 
digging equipment in it the igloo 
was even more crowded than the 
airbody. They backed away as far 
as they could get, bent against the, 
arc of the igloo wall, while I 
started up the augers, checked that 
they were vertical and watched 
the first castings spiral out. 

The foam igloo absorbs more 
sound than it reflects. Even so, 
the din inside the igloo was a lot 
worse than in the howling winds 
outside. When I thought they had 
seen enough to satisfy them for 
the moment, I waved them out of 
the crawl-through, followed, sealed 
it behind us and led them back into 
the airbody. 

“So far so good,” I said, twist- 
ing off the helmet and loosen- 
ing the suit. “We’ve got about 
forty meters to go, I think. 
Might as well wait in here as out 
there.” 

“How long is that?” 

“Maybe an hour. You can do 
what you like. What I’m going to 
do is take a shower. Then we’ll 
see how far we’ve gotten.” 

That was one of the nice things 
about having only three people 
aboard — we didn’t have to worry 
about water discipline very much. 
It’s astonishing how a quick wet- 
down revives you after you’ve come 
out of a hotsuit. When I had 
finished with mine I felt ready for 
anything. 

I was even prepared to eat some 
of Boyce Cochenour’ s gourmet 
cookery, but fortunately it wasn’t 



90 



IF 




necessary. The girl had taken over 
the kitchen and what she laid out 
was simple, light and reasonably 
non-toxic. On cooking like hers, 
I figured, I might be able to sur- 
vive long enough to collect my 
charter fee. It crossed my mind for 
a moment to wonder what made 
her do it and then I thought, of 
course, she’d had a lot of practice. 
With all the spare parts in 
Cochenour no doubt he had dietary 
problems far worse than mine. 

Well, not worse, exactly, in one 
sense. I didn’t think he was quite 
as likely to die of them. 

ACCORDING to the autosonic 
ii probes the highest point of 
tunnel A was close to tne little 
blind valley in which I had tied 
down. 

That was lucky. It meant that 
we might possibly be right over the 
Heechee’s own entrance. Not that 
we would be able to use it as the 
Heechee had used it. There wasn’t 
much chance that its mechanisms 
would have survived a quarter of 
a million years, exposed much of 
that time to surface wind, ablation 
and chemical corrosion. The good 
part was that if the tunnel had 
surfaced here it would be relatively 
easy to bore down to it. Even a 
quarter of a million years doesn’t 
produce really hard rock, especially 
without surface water to dissolve 
out solids and produce compact 
sediments. 

Up to a point the drilling turned 
out pretty much the way I had 
hoped. What was on the surface 
was little more than ashy sand 
and the augers chewed it out 



very rapidly. Too rapidly — when 
I went back into the igloo it was 
filled almost solid with castings 
and I had a devil of a job getting 
to the machines to switch the 
auger over to pumping the castings 
out through the crawl lock. 

T Mis was a dull, dirty part of the 
job, but it didn’t take long. 

I didn’t bother to go back into 
the airbody. I reported what was 
happening over the radio to Boyce 
and the girl, who were staring 
through the ports at me. I told 
them I thought we were getting 
close. 

But I didn’t tell them exactly how 
close. Actually we were only a 
meter or two from the indicated 
depth of the anomaly, so close that 
I didn’t bother to pump out all of 
the castings. I just made enough 
room to maneuver around, then re- 
directed the augers. And in five 
minutes the castings were begin- 
ning to come up with the pale blue 
glimmer that was the sign of a 
Heechee tunnel. 



VII 

ABOUT ten minutes after that 
XJL I keyed on my helmet trans- 
mitter and shouted: “Boyce, Dorrie 
— we’ve hit a tunnel.” 

Either they had been sitting 
around in their suits or they 
dressed faster than any maze rat. 
I unsealed the crawl-through 
and wiggled out to help them, 
but they were already coming out 
of the airbody, staggering against 
the wind over to me. 

They were both yelling questions 
and congratulations, but I stopped 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



91 




them. “Inside,” I ordered. “See 
for yourself.” As a matter of fact, 
they didn’t have to go that far. They 
could see the color as soon as they 
kneeled to enter the crawl-through. 

I followed and sealed the lock 
behind me. The reason was simple 
enough. As long as the tunnel 
wasn’t breached, it didn’t matter 
about the lock seal. But the 
interior of a Heechee tunnel that 
has remained inviolate is at a 
pressure only slightly above Earth- 
normal. Without the sealed dome, 
the minute we cracked the casing 
we would let the whole 20,000- 
millibar atmosphere of Venus pour 
in, heat and ablation and all. If 
the tunnel were empty or if what 
was in it were simple, sturdy 
stuff, no damage might be done. 
But if we had hit the jackpot we 
could have destroyed in a half- 
second what had waited a quarter- 
million years. 

We gathered around the shaft 
and I pointed down. The auger 
had left a clean shaft, about 
seventy centimeters by a little 
over a hundred, with rounded ends. 
At the bottom you could see the 
cold blue glow of the outside of the 
tunnel, only pocked and blotched 
by the loose castings I hadn’t 
bothered to get out. 

“Now what?” demanded Boyce. 
His voice was hoarse with 
excitement, which was, I guessed, 
natural enough. 

“Now we burn our way in.” 

I backed my clients away as 
far as they could get, pressed 
against the remaining heap of 
castings and unlimbered the 
firejets. I had already hung sheer- 



legs over the shaft and they went 
right down on their cable with no 
trouble until they were a few 
centimeters above the round of 
the tunnel. Then I fired them up. 

You wouldn’t think that anything 
a human being might do would 
change the temperature of the 
surface of Venus, but those fire- 
drills were something special. In 
the small space of the igloo the 
heat flamed up and around us and 
our hotsuit cooling systems were 
overloaded in seconds. 

Dorrie gasped, “Oh! I — I think 
I’m going to — ” 

Cochenour grabbed her. “Faint 
if you want to,” he said fiercely, 
“but don’t get sick. Walthers! 
How long does this go on?” 

It was as hard for me as it was 
for them. Practice doesn’t get 
you used to standing in front of 
a blast furnace with the doors off 
the hinges. “Maybe a minute,” 
I gasped. “Hold on — it’s all right.” 
It actually took a little more than 
that, maybe ninety seconds — 
my suit telltales were shouting 
alarm for more than half of the 
time. But the systems were built 
for these overloads and as long as 
we didn’t cook, the suits wouldn’t 
take any permanent harm. 

Then we were through. A half- 
meter circular section sagged, fell 
at one side and hung there. 

I turned off the firejets and 
we all breathed hard for a couple 
of minutes while the suit coolers 
gradually caught up with the load. 

“Wow,” said Dorotha. “That 
was pretty rough.” 

I looked at Cochenour. In the 
light that splashed up out of the 




shaft I could see he was frowning. 
I didn’t say anything. 1 just gave 
the jets another five-second burn 
to cut away the rest of the circular 
section. It fell free into the tunnel. 
We could hear it clatter against the 
floor. 

Then I turned on my helmet 
radio. “There’s no pressure dif- 
ferential,” I said. 

The frown didn’t change, nor did 
he speak. 

“Which means this one has been 
breached,” I went on. “Let’s go 
back to the airbody and take a 
break before we do anything else.” 

Dorotha shrieked, “Audee! 
What’s the matter with you? I 
want to go down there and see 
what’s inside!” 

Cochenour said bitterly, “Shut 
up, Dorrie. Don’t you hear what 
he’s saying? This one’s a dud.” 

T HERE’S always the chance 
that a breached tunnel opened 
to a seismological invasion, not to 
a maze rat with a cutting torch. If 
so there might be something worth- 
while in it anyway. I didn’t have 
the heart to kill all Dorotha’s 
enthusiasm with one blow. 

So we did swing down the cable, 
one by one, into the Heechee dig 
and look around. 

It was wholly bare, as most of 
them are, as far as we could see. 
That wasn’t actually very far, for 
the other thing wrong with a 
breached tunnel is that you need 
pretty good equipment to explore 
it. After the overloads our suits 
were all right for a couple hours 
but not much more and when we 
had tramped about a half-mile 



down the tunnel without finding 
a thing all of us were willing to 
tramp back and return to the 
airbody. 

We cleaned up and made our- 
selves something to drink. Even 
squandering more of the water 
reserves on showers didn’t do 
much for our spirits. We had to 
eat, but Cochenour didn’t bother 
with his gourmet exhibition. 
Dorotha silently threw tabs into 
the radar oven and we fed gloomily 
on emergency rations. 

“Well, that’s only the first one,” 
she said at last, determined to be 
sunny about it. “And it’s only our 
second day.” 

Cochenour said, “Shut up, 
Dorrie. The one thing I’m not is a 
good loser.” He was staring at the 
probe trace. “Walthers, how 
many tunnels are unmarked but 
empty, like this one?” 

“How can I answer a question 
like that? If they’re unmarked 
there’s no record of them.” 

“So those traces don’t mean 
anything. We might dig one a day 
for the next three weeks and find 
every one a dud.” 

I nodded. “We surely might, 
Boyce.” 

He looked at me alertly. “And?” 

“And that’s not the worst part 
of it. I’ve taken parties out to 
dig who would have gone mad 
with joy to have opened even a 
breached tunnel. It’s perfectly 
possible to dig every day for weeks 
and never hit a real Heechee 
tunnel at all. Don’t knock it — at 
least you got some action for 
your money.” 

“I told you, Walthers, I’m not

a loser. Second place is no good.” 
He thought for a minute, then 
barked: “You picked this spot. 
Did you know what you were 
doing?” 

Did I? I could have told him 
about my months of studying 
records from the first landings on. 

I could have mentioned how much 
trouble I went to — and how many 
regulations I broke — to get the 
military survey reports, how far 
I had traveled to talk to the 
Defense crews who had been on 
those early digs. I might have let 
him know how hard it had been to 
locate old Jorolemon Hegramet, 
now teaching exotic archeology 
back in Tennessee and how many 
times he and I had corresponded. 

All I said was, “The fact that 
we found one tunnel shows 1 
knew my business as a guide. 
That was all you paid for. It’s up to 
you if we keep looking or not.” 

He looked at his thumbnail, 
considering. 

The girl said cheerfully, “Buck 
up, Boyce. Look at all the other 
chances we’ve got — and even if 
we miss, it’ll still be fun telling 
everybody about it back in 
Cincinnati.” 

He didn’t even look at her. “Isn’t 
there any way to tell whether a tun- 
nel has been breached or not with- 
out going inside?” 

“Sure,” I said. “You can tell by 
tapping the outside shell. You can 
hear the difference in the sound.” 

“But you have to dig down to it 
first?” 

“Right.” 

We left it at that. I got back 
into my hotsuit to strip away the 



now useless igloo so that we could 
move the drills. 

I didn’t really want to discuss 
it any more, because I didn’t 
want him to ask a question that I 
might want to lie about. I try 
the best I can to tell the truth — 
makes it easier to remember what 
you’ve said. 

On the other hand, I’m not 
fanatic about it and I didn’t see 
that it was any of my business to 
correct a mistaken impression. 
For instance, obviously Cochenour 
and the girl had the impression that 
I hadn’t bothered to sound the 
tunnel casing because we had 
already dug down to it and it was 
just as easy to cut in. 

But, of course, I had tested it. 
That had been the first thing I 
did as soon as the drill had 
reached down that far. And the 
high-pressure thunk had broken 
my heart. I had had to wait a 
couple of minutes before I had 
managed to call out to them that 
we had reached the outer casing. 

At that time, I had not quite 
faced up to the question of just 
what I would have done if it had 
turned out that the tunnel had 
not been breached. 

VIII 

C ochenour and Dome 

Keefer were maybe the fiftieth 
or sixtieth party I had taken to a 
Heechee dig and I wasn’t surprised 
that they were willing to work like 
coolies. I don’t care how lazy and 
bored they start out, by the time 
people actually come close to 
finding something that belonged to

IF 




an almost completely unknown 
alien race — left there when the 
closest thing to a human being on 
Earth was a slope-browed furry 
little beast killing other beasts 
with antelope bones— they begin 
to burn with exploration fever. 

My current clients worked hard 
and drove me hard — and I was as 
eager as they. Maybe more so. 
As the days went past I found 
myself rubbing my right side, just 
under the short ribs, more and 
more often. 

The military boys overflew us a 
half-dozen times in the first few 
days. They didn’t say much, just 
made formal requests for identifi- 
cation which they already well 
knew. Regulations say if you find 
anything you’re supposed to 
report it right away. Over 
Cochenour’s objections I reported 
finding that first breached tunnel, 
which surprised them a little, 1 
think. 

Site B was a pegmatite dike. 
The other two fairly bright ones 
that I had called D and E showed 
nothing at all when we dug, mean- 
ing that the sound reflections had 
probably been caused by nothing 
more than invisible interfaces in 
layers of rock or ash or gravel. 
I vetoed trying to dig C, the best 
looking of the bunch. Cochenour 
gave me a hell of an argument 
about it, but I held out. The 
military were still looking in on us 
every now and then and I didn’t 
want to get any closer to their 
perimeter than we already were. 
I half-promised that if we didn’t 
have any luck elsewhere in the 
mascons we’d sneak back to C for 

THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



a quick dig before returning to the 
Spindle. We left it at that. 

We lifted the airbody, moved to 
a new position and set out a new 
pattern of probes. 

By the end of the second week 
we had dug nine times and come 
up empty every time. We were get- 
ting low on igloos and probes. We 
had completely run out of tolerance 
for each other. 

Cochenour had turned sullen and 
savage. I hadn’t planned on 
liking the man much when I first 
met him, but I hadn’t expected him 
to be as bad as turned out. Con- 
sidering that this whole deal had to 
be only a game with him — with all 
his money the extra fortune he 
might pick up by discovering some 
new Heechee artifacts couldn’t 
have meant anything but extra 
points on a score pad — he was 
playing for blood. 

I wasn’t particularly graceful 
myself, for the matter. The plain 
fact was that the pills from the 
Quackery weren’t helping as much 
as they should have. My mouth 
tasted as if rats had nested in it. 
I was getting headaches and I was 
beginning to knock things over. 
The thing about the liver is that it 
sort of regulates your internal diet. 
It filters out poisons, converts 
some of the carbohydrates into 
other carbohydrates that you can 
use — it patches together amino 
acids into proteins. If it isn’t 
working you die. The doctor had 
been over all of it with me and I 
could visualize what was going on 
inside me, the mahogany-red 
cells dying and being replaced by 
clusters of fat and yellowish

matter. It was an ugly kind of 
picture. The ugliest part was that 
there wasn’t anything I could do 
about it. Only go on taking pills — 
and they wouldn’t work past a mat- 
ter of a few days more. Liver, bye- 
bye — hepatic failure, hello. 

So we were a bad bunch. 
Cochenour was a bastard because 
it was his nature to be a bastard 
and I was a bastard because I 
was sick and desperate. The only 
decent human being aboard was 
the girl. 

She did her best. She really did. 
She was sometimes sweet and 
often even pretty and she was 
always ready to meet the power 
people — Cochenour and me — more 
than halfway. The situation was 
clearly tough on her. She was only 
a kid. No matter how grownup 
she acted, she just hadn’t been 
alive long enough to grow a defense 
against concentrated meanness. 
Add the fact that we were all 
beginning to hate the sight and 
sound and smell of each other — 
and in an airbody you got to know 
a lot about how people smelled. 
There wasn’t much joy on Venus 
for Dorrie Keefer. 

Or for any of us, especially after 
I broke the news that we were down 
to our last igloo. 

Cochenour cleared his throat. 
He sounded like a fighter-plane 
jockey blowing the covers off his 
guns in preparation for combat. 
Dorrie attempted to divert him. 

“Audee,” she said brightly, 
“you know what I think we could 
do? We could go back to that site 
that looked good near the military 
reservation.” 



It was the wrong diversion. I 
shook my head. “No.” 

“What the hell do you mean?” 
rumbled Cochenour, revving up 
for battle. 

“What I said. No. That’s a des- 
peration trick and I’m not that 
desperate.” 

“Walthers,” he snarled, “you’ll 
be desperate when I tell you to be 
desperate. I can still stop payment 
on that check.” 

“No, you can’t. The union 
won’t let you. The regulations are 
very clear about that. You pay up 
unless I disobey a lawful directive. 
You can’t make me do anything 
against the law — and going in- 
side the military reservation is 
extremely against the law.” 

He shifted over to cold war. 
“No,” he said softly, “you’re 
wrong about that. It’s only 
against the law if a court says it 
is — after we do it. You’re only 
right if your lawyers are smarter 
than my lawyers. Honestly, 
Walthers, I pay my lawyers to be 
the smartest there are.” 

T HE difficult part was that he 
was even more right than he 
knew — my liver was on his side. 
I couldn’t spare time for arbitra- 
tion because without his money and 
my transplant I wouldn’t live that 
long. 

Dorrie, listening with her bird- 
like look of friendly interest, got 
between us again. “Well, then, 
how about this? We just put down 
here. Why don’t we wait and see 
what the probes show? Maybe 
we’ll hit something even better 
than that trace C — ” 



96 



IF 




“There isn’t going to be any- 
thing good here,” he said without 
looking at her. 

“Why, Boyce, how do you know 
that? We haven’t even finished 
the soundings.” 

He said, “Look, Dorotha, listen 
close one time and then shut up. 
Walthers is playing games. You 
see where we are now?” 

He brushed past me and tapped 
out the program for a full map 
display. His action surprised me 
somewhat because I hadn’t known 
he knew how. The charts sprang 
up with virtual images of our 
position— the shafts we had 
already cut, the great irregular 
edge of the military reservation 
overlaid on the plot of mascons and 
navigation aids. 

“You see? We’re not even in 
the high-density mass areas now. 
Is that true, Walthers? We’ve tried 
all the good locations and come 
up dry?” 

I said, “You’re partly right, 
Boyce, but I’m not playing games. 
This site is a good possibility. You 
can see it on the map. We’re not 
over any mascon, that’s true, but 
we’re right between two of them 
that are located pretty close 
together. Sometimes you find a 
dig that connects two complexes 
— and it has happened that the 
connecting passage was closer to 
the surface than any other part of 
the system. I can’t guarantee 
we’ll hit anything here, but it’s not 
impossible that we might.” 

“Just damn unlikely?” 

“Well, no more unlikely than 
anywhere else. I told you a week 
ago — you got your money’s worth 



the first day, just finding any 
Heechee tunnel at all, even a 
spoiled one. There are maze rats in 
the Spindle who went five years 
without seeing that much.” I 
thought for a minute. “I’ll make a 
deal with you,” I said. 

“I’m listening.” 

“We’re down here and there’s 
at least a chance we can hit some- 
thing. Let’s try. We’ll deploy the 
probes and see what they turn 
up. If we get a good trace we’ll 
dig it. If we don’t — then I’ll think 
about going back to trace C.” 

“Think about it!” he roared. 

“Don’t push me, Cochenour. 
You don’t know what you’re get- 
ting into. The military reservation 
is not to be fooled with. Those 
boys shoot first and ask later — 
and there aren’t any policemen 
or courts on Venus even to ask 
them questions.” 

“I don’t know,” he said after a 
moment. 

“No,” I said, “you don’t. And 
that’s what you’re paying me for. 
I do know.” 

“Yes,” he agreed, “you probably 
do, but whether you’re telling me 
the truth about what you know is 
another question. Hegramet never 
said anything about digging 
between mascons.” 

And then he looked at me with 
a completely opaque expression, 
waiting to see whether I would 
catch him up on what he had just 
said. 

I didn’t respond. I gave him back 
an opaque look. I didn’t say a 
word, simply waited to see what 
would come next. I was pretty 
sure that it would not be any sort 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



97 




of explanation of how he happened 
to know Hegramet’s name or what 
dealings he had had with the 
greatest Earthside authority on 
Heechee diggings, and it wasn’t. 

“Put out /your probes and we’ll 
try it your way one more time,’’ 
he said at last. 

I PLOPPED out the probes, got 
good penetration on all of 
them, started firing the noise- 
makers. I sat watching the first 
buildup of lines on the scan as 
though I expected them to carry 
useful information. They couldn’t, 
of course, but it was a good excuse 
to think privately for a moment. 

Cochenour needed to be thought 
about. He hadn’t come to Venus 
just for the ride — that was clear. 
He had known he was going to be 
sinking shafts after Heechee digs 
before he ever left Earth. He had 
briefed himself on the whole bit, 
even to handling the instruments 
on the airbody. My sales talk about 
Heechee treasures had been 
wasted on a customer whose mind 
had been made up to buy at 
least a half-year earlier and tens 
of millions of miles away. 

All that I understood, but the 
more I understood the more I saw 
that I didn’t understand. What I 
really wanted was to give 
Cochenour a quarter and send him 
to the movies for a while so I could 
talk privately to the girl. Unfor- 
tunately, there was nowhere to 
send him. I managed to force a 
yawn, complain about the boredom 
of waiting for the probe traces to 
build up and suggest a nap. Not 
that I would have been real con- 



fident he wasn’t lying there with his 
ears flapping, listening t<? us. It 
didn’t matter. Nobody acted sleepy 
but me. All I got out of it was an 
offer from Dorrie to watch the 
screen and wake me if anything 
interesting turned up. 

So I said the hell with it and 
went to sleep myself. 

It was not a good sleep, because 
lying there waiting for it gave me 
time to notice how truly lousy 
I felt and in how many ways. A 
sort of permanent taste of bile 
lived in the back of my mouth, as 
though I had just thrown up. My 
head ached and I was beginning to 
see ghost images wandering 
fuzzily around my field of vision. 
When I took my pills I didn’t 
count the ones that were left. I 
didn’t want to know. 

I’d set my private alarm for 
three hours, thinking maybe that 
would give Cochenour time to get 
sleepy and turn in, leaving the 
girl up and about and perhaps 
conversational. But when I woke 
up there was Cochenour, cooking 
himself an herb omelette with the 
last of our sterile eggs. 

“You were right, Walthers.’’ 
He grinned. “I was sleepy. Had 
a nice little nap. Ready for any- 
thing now. Want some eggs?” 

Actually I did want them, but of 
course I didn’t dare eat them, so I 
glumly swallowed what the 
Quackery had allowed me to have 
and watched him stuff himself. It 
was unfair that a man of ninety 
could be so healthy that he didn’t 
have to think about digestion, while 
I was — well, there wasn't any profit 
in that kind of thinking, so I

offered to play some music. Dorrie 
picked Swan Lake and I started 
it up. 

And then \ had an idea and 
headed for the tool lockers. They 
needed checking. The auger 
heads were about due for re- 
placement and I knew we were 
low on spares. The other thing 
about the tool lockers was that 
they were as far from the galley 
as you could get and stay inside 
the airbody and I hoped Dorrie 
would follow me. 

She did. 

“Need any help, Audee?” 

“Glad to have it,” I said. “Here, 
hold these for me. Don’t get the 
grease on your clothes.” 1 didn’t 
expect her to ask me why they 
had to be held. She didn’t. She 
only laughed. 

“Grease? I don’t think I’d even 
notice it, dirty as I am. I guess 
we’re all about ready to get back 
to civilization.” 

Cochenour was frowning over 
the probe trace and paying us no 
attention. I said, “Meaning 
which kind of civilization, the 
Spindle or Earth?” 

What I had in mind was to start 
her talking about Earth, but she 
went the other way. “Oh, the 
Spindle, Audee. I thought it was 
fascinating and we really didn’t 
get to see much of it. And the 
people. Like that Indian fellow 
who ran the cafe. The cashier was 
his wife, wasn’t she?” 

“One of them. She’s the number- 
one wife. The waitress was 
number three and he has another 
one at home with the kids. There 
are five of those — all three wives 



involved.” But I wanted to go in 
the other direction, so 1 said, “It’s 
pretty much the same as on Earth. 
Vastra would be running a tourist 
trap in Benares if he wasn’t 
running one here — and he 
wouldn’t be here if he hadn’t 
shipped out with the military and 
terminated here. I’d be guiding in 
Texas, I suppose. If there’s any 
open country left to guide in, 
maybe up along the Canadian 
River. How about you?” 

All the time I was picking up the 
same four or five tools, studying 
the serial numbers and putting 
them back. She didn’t notice. 
“How do you mean?” 

“Well, what did you do before 
you came here?” 

“Oh, I worked in Boyce's office 
for a while.” 

That information was encourag- 
ing. Maybe she’d remember some- 
thing about his connection with 
Professor Hegramet. “What were 
you, a secretary?” 

“Something like that. Boyce let 
me handle — oh, what’s that?” 

That was an incoming call on 
the radio. 

“So go answer,” snarled 
Cochenour across the airbody. 

I took it on the earjack, since that 
was my nature. There wasn’t any 
privacy to speak of in an airbody 
and I wanted what little crumbs of 
it I could find. It was the base 
calling, a comm sergeant I knew 
named Littleknees. I signed in 
irritably, regretting the chance to 
pump Dorotha about her boss. 

“A private word for you, 
Audee,” said Sergeant Littleknees. 
“Got your sahib around?” 



THE MERCHANTS.OF VENUS 



99 




Littleknces and I had exchanged 
radio chatter for a long time and 
there was something about the 
cheerfulness of her tone that 
bothered me. I didn’t look at 
Cochenour, but I knew he was 
listening — only to my side, of 
course, because of the earjack. 
“In sight but not receiving,” I 
said. “What have you got for me?” 

“Just a little news bulletin,” 
the sergeant purred. “It came 
over the synsat net a couple of 
minutes ago. Information only. 
That means we don’t have to do 
anything about it, but maybe you 
do, honey.” 

“Standing by,” I said, studying 
the plastic housing of the radio. 

The sergeant chuckled. “Your 
sahib’s charter captain would like 
to have a word with him when 
found. It’s kind of urgent, ’cause 
the captain is righteously kissed 
off.” 

“Yes, base,” I said. “Your 
signals received, strength ten.” 

The sergeant made an amused 
noise again, but this time it 
wasn’t a chuckle, it was a down- 
right giggle. “The thing is,” she 
said, “his check for the charter fee 
bounced. Want to know what the 
bank said? You’d never guess. 
‘Insufficient funds,’ that’s what 
they said.” 

The pain under my right lower 
ribs was permanent, but right then 
it seemed to get a lot worse. I 
gritted my teeth. “Ah, Sergeant 
Littleknees,” I croaked, “can 
you — ah — verify that estimate?” 

“Sorry, honey,” she buzzed 
sympathetically in my ear. 
“But there’s no doubt in the 



world. Captain got a credit report 
on him and it turned up n.g. When 
your customer gets back to the 
Spindle there’ll be a make-good 
warrant waiting for him.” 

“Thank you for the synoptic 
report.” I said hollowly. “I will 
verify departure time before 
we take off.” 

And I turned off the radio and 
gazed at my rich billionaire 
client. 

“What the hell’s the matter 
with you, Walthers?” he growled. 

But I wasn’t hearing his voice. 
I was hearing what the happy 
fellow at the Quackery had told 
me. The equations were un- 
forgettable. Cash = new liver + 
happy survival. No cash = total 
hepatic failure + death. And my 
cash supply had just dried up. 

IX 

W HEN you get a really big 
piece of news you have to 
let it trickle through your system 
and get thoroughly absorbed 
before you do anything about it. 
It isn’t a matter of seeing the 
implications. I saw them right 
away— you bet. It’s a matter of 
letting the system reach equilib- 
rium. So I puttered for a minute. 
I listened to Tschaikowsky. I 
made sure the radio switch was off 
so as not to waste power. I checked 
the synoptic plot. It would have 
been nice if there had been some- 
thing to show, but the way things 
were. going there wouldn’t be, of 
course, and there wasn’t. A few 
pale echoes were building up. 
But nothing with the shape of a 



100 



IF 




Heechee dig and nothing very 
bright. The data were still coming 
in, but there was no way for those 
feeble plots to turn into the 
mother lode that could save us all, 
even broke bastard Cochenour. 
I looked out at as much of the sky 
as I could to see how the weather 
was. It didn’t matter, of course, 
but some of the high white calomel 
clouds were scudding among the 
purples and yellows of the other 
mercury halides. It was beautiful 
and I hated it. 

Cochenour had forgotten about 
his omelette and was watching me 
thoughtfully. So was Dorrie, still 
holding the augers in their grease- 
paper wrap. I grinned at her. 

“Pretty,” I said, referring to the 
music. The Auckland Phil- 
harmonic was just getting to the 
part where the little swans come 
out arm in arm and do a fast, 
bouncy pas de quatre across the 
stage. It has always been one of 
my favorite parts of Swan Lake. 
“We’ll listen to the rest of it 
later,” I said and snapped it off. 

“All right,” snarled Cochenour, 
“what’s going on?” 

I sat down on an igloo pack and 
lit a cigarette, because one of the 
adjustments my internal system 
had made had been to calculate 
that we didn’t have to worry much 
about coddling our oxygen supply 
any more. I said, “There’s a 
question that’s bothering me, 
Cochenour. How did you get on to 
Professor Hegramet?” 

He grinned and relaxed. “Is that 
all that’s on your mind? I checked 
out the place before I came. Why 
not?” 



“No reason, except that you let 
me think you didn’t know a 
thing.” 

He shrugged. “If you had any 
brains you’d know I didn’t get 
rich by being stupid. You think 
I’d come umpty-million miles 
without knowing what I was 
coming to?” 

“No, you wouldn’t, but you did 
your best to make me think you 
would. No matter. So you dug 
up somebody who could point you 
to whatever was worth stealing 
on Venus and somebody steered 
you to Hegramet. Then what? 
Did he tell you I was dumb 
enough to be your boy?” 

^Cochenour wasn’t quite as 
relaxed, but he wasn’t aggressive 
either. He said, “Hegramet told 
me you were the right guide to 
find a virgin tunnel. That’s all — 
except briefing me on the Heechee 
and so on. If you hadn’t come to 
us I would have come to you. You 
just saved me the trouble.” 

I said, a little surprised, “You 
know, I think you’re telling me 
the truth. Except you left out one 
thing — it wasn’t the fun of making 
more money that you were after, 
it was just money, right? Money 
that you needed.” I turned to 
Dorotha, who was standing frozen 
with the augers in her hand. “How 
about it, Dorrie? Did you know the 
old man was broke?” 

Putting it that way was not too 
smart. I saw what she was about 
to do just before she did it, and I 
jumped off the igloo. I was a 
little too late. She dropped the 
augers before I could get them 
from her, but fortunately they 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS

landed flat and the blades weren’t 
chipped. I picked them up and 
put them away. 

She had answered the question 
well enough. 

I said, “I see you didn’t know. 
Tough on you, doll. His check to 
the captain of the Gagarin is still 
bouncing and 1 would imagine the 
one he gave me isn’t going to be 
much better. I hope you got it in 
furs and jewels — and my advice to 
you is to hide them before the 
creditors want them back.” 

She didn’t even look at me. She 
was only looking at Cochenour, 
whose expression was all the 
confirmation she needed. 

I don’t know what I expected 
from her, rage or reproaches or 
tears. What she did was whisper, 
“Oh, Boyce, I’m so sorry —” and 
she went over and put her arm 
around him. 

I TURN ED my back on them, 
because I didn’t like looking at 
him. The strapping ninety- 
year-old buck on Full Medical had 
turned into a defeated old man. 
For the First time he looked all of 
his age and maybe a little more — 
the mouth half open and trembling, 
the straight back stooped, the 
bright blue eyes watering. She 
stroked him and crooned to him. 

I looked at the synoptic web 
again for lack of anything better 
to do. It was about as clear as it 
was going to get and it was empty. 
We had nearly a fifty per cent 
overlap from our previous sound- 
ings, so I could tell that the inter- 
esting-looking scratches at one 
edge were nothing to get excited 



about. We had checked' them out 
already. They were only ghosts. 

No rescue there. 

I felt oddly relaxed. There was 
something tranquilizing about the 
realization that I had nothing much 
left to lose. Matters had fallen into 
a different perspective. I had not 
given up completely. There were 
still things I could do. They might 
not have anything to do with pro- 
longing my life, but the taste in 
my mouth and the pain in my gut 
weren’t letting me enjoy life very 
much anyway. I could, for in- 
stance, write Audee Walthers off. 
And since only a miracle could 
keep me from dying in a matter of 
days I could use what time I had 
for something else. What else? 
Well, Dorrie was a nice kid. I 
could fly the airbody back to the 
Spindle, turn Cochenour over to 
the gendarmes and spend my last 
day or so introducing her around. 
Vastra or BeeGee would help her 
get organized. She might not even 
have to go into prostitution or the 
rackets. The high season wasn’t 
that far off and she would do well 
with a little booth of prayer fans 
and Heechee lucky pieces for the 
Terry tourists. Maybe that wasn’t 
much, even from her point of view, 
but it was something. 

Or I could fling myself on the 
mercy of the Quackery. They might 
let me have the new liver on 
credit. The only reason I had for 
thinking they wouldn’t was that 
they never had. 

Or I could open the two-fuel 
valves and let them mix for ten 
minutes or so before hitting the 
igniter. The explosion wouldn’t

leave much of the airbody or us — 
and nothing at all of our problems. 

“Oh, hell,” I said. “Buck up, 
Cochenour. We’re not dead yet.” 
He looked at me for a minute. 
He patted Dome’s shoulder and 
pushed her gently away. He said, 
“I will be, soon enough. I’m sorry 
about all this, Dorotha. And I’m 
sorry about your check, Walthers. 
I expect you needed the money.” 
“You have no idea.” 

He said with difficulty, “Do you 
want me to explain?” 

“I don’t see that it makes any 
difference, but — yes, out of 
curiosity I do.” 7 
I let him tell me and he did it 
steadily and succinctly. I could 
have guessed. A man his age is 
either very, very rich or dead. He 
was only quite rich. He had kept 
his industries going on what was 
left after he siphoned off the 
costs of transplant and treatment, 
calciphylaxis and prosthesis, 
protein regeneration here, choles- 
terol flushing there, a million for 
this, a hundred grand a week for 
that ... oh, it went — I could see 
that. 

“You just don’t know,” he said, 
“what it takes to keep a hundred- 
year-old man alive until you try it.” 
I corrected him automatically. 
“Ninety, you mean.” 

“No, not ninety — and not even 
a hundred. I think it’s at least 
a hundred and ten and it could 
be more. Who counts? You pay 
the doctors and they patch you 
up for a month or two. You 
wouldn’t know.” 

Oh, wouldn’t I just, I said, but 
not out loud. I let him go on, telling 



about how the federal inspectors 
were closing in and he skipped 
Earth to make his fortune all over 
again on Venus. 

But I wasn’t listening any more, 

I was writing on the back of a 
navigation form. When I finished 
I passed the paper to Cochenour. 

“Sign it,” I said. 

“What is it?” 

“Does it matter? You don’t 
have any choice, do you? But it’s 
a release from the all-rights 
section of our charter agreement — 
you acknowledge you have no 
claim, that your check is rubber 
and that you voluntarily waive 
your ownership of anything we 
find in my favor.” 

He frowned. “What’s this bit at 
the end?” 

“That’s where I give you ten per 
cent of anything we do find — if 
we do find anything.” 

“That’s charity,” he said, but he 
was signing. “I don’t mind charity, 
especially since, as you point out, 
I don’t have any choice. But I 
can read that web as well as you 
can, Walthers, and there’s nothing 
on it to find.” 

“No,” I said, folding the paper 
and putting it in my pocket. “But 
we’re not going to dig here. That 
trace is as bare as your bank 
account. What we’re going to do is 
dig trace C.” 

I LIT another cigarette and 
thought for a minute. I was 
wondering how much to tell them 
of what I had spent five years 
finding out and figuring out, 
schooling myself not even to hint 
at what I knew to anyone. I was 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



103 




sure in my mind that nothing I 
said would make a difference, 
but the words didn’t want to say 
themselves anyway. 

I made myself speak. 

“You remember Subhash 
Vastra, the fellow who ran the 
trap where I met you. He came to 
Venus with the military. He was a 
weapons specialist so he went into 
the cafe business when they 
terminated him, but he was pretty 
big at it in the service.” 

Dorrie said, “Do you mean there 
are Heechee weapons on the 
reservation?” 

“No. Nobody has ever found a 
Heechee weapon. But they have 
found targets.” 

It was actually physically diffi- 
cult for me to speak the next part, 
but I got it out. “Anyway, Sub 
Vastra says they were targets. The 
higher brass wasn’t sure and I 
think the matter has been pigeon- 
holed on the reservation by now. 
But they found triangular pieces 
of Heechee wall material — that 
blue, light-emitting stuff they 
lined the tunnels with. There were 
dozens of them and they all had a 
pattern of radiating lines — Sub 
said they looked like , targets to 
him. And they had been drilled 
through by something that left the 
holes chalky as talc. Do you know 
anything that would do that to 
Heechee wall material?” 

Dorrie was about to say she 
didn’t but Cochenour interrupted 
her. 

“That’s impossible,” he said 
flatly. 

“Right. That’s what the brass 
said. They decided it had to be done 



in the process of fabrication, for 
some Heechee purpose we’ll 
never know. But Vastra says not. 
He says they looked exactly like 
the paper targets from the firing 
range under the reservation. The 
holes weren’t all in the same place. 
The lines looked like scoring 
markers. That’s evidence he’s 
right. Not proof. But evidence.” 

“And you think you can find the 
gun that made those holes where 
we marked trace C ?” 

1 hesitated. “I wouldn’t put it 
that strongly. Call it hope. But 
there is one more thing. 

“These targets were turned up by 
a prospector nearly forty years 
ago. He turned them in, reported 
his find, went out looking for more 
and got killed. That happened a 
lot in those days. No one paid much 
attention until some military types 
got a look at them — and that’s 
how come the reservation is where 
it is. They spotted the site where 
he had reported finding them, 
staked out everything for a thou- 
sand kilometers around and 
labeled it all off limits. And they 
dug and dug, turned up about a 
dozen Heechee tunnels, but most 
of them bare and the rest cracked 
and spoiled.” 

“Then there’s nothing there,” 
growled Cochenour, looking 
perplexed. 

“There’s nothing they found,” 
I corrected him. “But in those 
days prospectors lied a lot. He 
reported the wrong location for the 
find. At the time he was shacked up 
with a young lady who later mar- 
ried a man named Allemang and 
her son is a friend of mine. He 



104 



IF 




had a map. The right location, 
as near as - 1 can figure-v-the 
navigation marks weren’t what 
they are now — is right about 
where we are now, give or take 
some. I saw digging marks a 
couple of times and I think they 
were his.” I slipped the little 
private magnetofiche out of my 
pocket and put it into the virtual 
map display; it showed a single 
mark, an orange X. “That’s 
where I think we might find the 
weapon, somewhere near that 
X. And as you can see, the only 
undug indication there is good 
old trace C.” 

Silence for a minute. I listened 
to the distant outside howl of the 
wind, waiting for them to say 
something. 

Dorrie was looking troubled. 
“I don’t know if I like trying to 
find a new weapon,” she said. 
“It’s — it’s like bringing back the 
bad old days again.” 

I shrugged. Cochenour, begin- 
ning to look more like himself 
again, said, “The point isn’t 
whether we really want to find a 
weapon, is it? The point is that we 
want to find an untapped Heechee 
dig for whatever is in it — but the 
soldiers think there might be a 
weapon somewhere around, so 
they aren’t going to let us dig, 
right? They’ll shoot us first and 
ask questions later. Wasn’t that 
what you said?” 

“So how do you propose to get 
around that little problem?” he 
asked. 

If I were a truthful man I 
would have said I wasn’t sure I 
could. Looked at honestly, the odds 



were we would 4 get caught and very 
likely shot. But we had so little to 
lose, Cochenour and I, that I 
didn’t think that important enough 
to mention. 

I said, “We try to fool them. We 
send the airbody off and you and 
I stay behind to do the digging. 
If they think we’re gone they 
won’t be keeping us under surveil- 
lance. All we have to worry about 
is being picked up on a routine 
perimeter search.” 

“Audee!” cried the girl. “If you 
and Boyce stay here — But that 
means I have to take the airbody 
and I can’t fly this thing.” 

“No, you can’t. But you can let 
it fly itself.” I rushed on: “Oh, 
you’ll waste fuel and you’ll get 
bounced around a lot. But you’ll 
get there on autopilot. It’ll even 
land you at the Spindle.” Not 
necessarily easily or well — I 
closed my mind to the thought of 
what an automatic landing might 
do to my one and only airbody. 
She would survive it, though, 
ninety-nine chances out of a 
hundred. 

“Then what?” Cochenour de- 
manded. 

There were big holes in the plan 
at this point, but I closed my mind 
to them, too. “Dorrie looks up my 
friend BeeGee Allemang. I’ll 
give you a note to give him with all 
the coordinates and so on and 
he’ll come and pick us up. With 
extra tanks we’ll have air and 
power for maybe forty-eight hours 
after you leave. That’s plenty of 
time for you to get there, find 
BeeGee and give him the message, 
and for him to get back. If he’s 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



105 




late, of course, we’re in trouble. If 
we don’t find anything we’ve 
wasted our time. But if we do — ” 
I shrugged. “I didn’t say it was a 
guarantee — I only said it gave us 
a chance.” 

D ORRIE was quite a nice 
person, considering her age 
and her circumstances, but one of 
the things she lacked was self- 
confidence. She had not been 
trained to it — she had been getting 
it as a prosthesis, from Cochenour 
most recently, I suppose before 
that from whoever preceded 
Cochenour in her life — at her age, 
maybe her father. 

The biggest problem was per- 
suading Dorrie she could do her 
part. “It won’t work,” she kept 
saying. “I’m sorry. It isn’t that 1 
don’t want to help. I do, but I 
can’t. It just won’t work.” 

Well, it would have. 

Or at least I think it would have. 
In any event, we never got to try 
it. Between us, Cochenour and 1 
did get Dorrie to agree to give it a 
try. We packed up what little gear 
we had put outside, flew back to 
the ravine, landed and began to set 
up for the dig. But I was feeling 
poorly — thick, headachy, clumsy — 
and I suppose Cochenour had his 
own problems. Between the two of 
us we managed to catch the casing 
of the drill in the exit port while 
we were off-loading it. And while 
I was jockeying it one way from 
above, Cochenour pulled the other 
way from beneath and the whole 
thing came down on top of him. It 
didn’t kill him. But it gouged his 
suit and broke his leg and that took 



care of my idea of digging trace 
C with him. 

X 

T HE suit leg had been ruptured 
through eight or ten plies, but 
there was enough left to keep the 
air out, if not the pressure. 

The first thing I did was check 
the drill to make sure it wasn’t 
damaged. It wasn’t. The second 
thing was to fight Cochenour back 
into the lock. That took about 
everything I had, but I managed it. 

Dorrie was great. No hysterics, 
no foolish questions. We got him 
out of his suit and looked him 
over. He was unconscious. The leg 
was compounded, with bone 
showing through. He was bleeding 
from the mouth and nose, and he 
had vomited inside his helmet. 
All in all he was about the worst- 
looking hundred-and-some-year- 
old man you’ll ever see — live one, 
anyway. But he hadn’t taken 
enough heat to cook his brain. His 
heart was still going — well, 
whosever heart it had been in the 
first place, I mean. It had been a 
good investment — it pumped right 
along. The bleeding stopped by 
itself except from the nasty 
business on the leg. 

Dorrie called the military res- 
ervation for me, got Eve Little- 
knees, was put right through to the 
base surgeon. He told me what to 
do. At first he wanted me to pack 
up and bring Cochenour right over 
but I vetoed that — said I wasn’t 
in shape to fly and it would be too 
rough a ride. Then he gave me 
step-by-steps and I followed them 




easily enough: reduced the fracture, 
packed the gash, closed the wound 
with surgical Velcro and meat 
glue, sprayed a bandage all around 
and poured on a cast. It took about 
an hour. Cochenour would have 
come to while we were doing it 
except I gave him a sleepy needle. 

Then it was just a matter of 
taking pulse and respiration and 
blood-pressure readings to satisfy 
the surgeon and promising to get 
him back to the Spindle shortly. 
When the surgeon was through, 
still annoyed at me for not bringing 
Cochenour over, Sergeant Little- 
knees came back on. I could tell 
what was on her mind. 

“Uh, honey? How did it 
happen?” 

“A great big Heechee came up 
out of the ground and bit him,” 
I said. “I know what you’re 
thinking and you’ve got an evil 
mind. It was just an accident.” 

“Sure,” she said. “Okay. I just 
wanted you to know I don’t 
blame you a bit.” And she signed 
off. 

Dorrie was cleaning Cochenour 
up as best she could, pretty 
profligate with the water reserves, 
I thought. I left her to it while I 
made myself some coffee, lit a 
cigarette and sat and thought. 

By the time Dorrie had done 
what she could for Cochenour, then 
cleaned up the worst of the mess 
and begun to do such important 
tasks as repairing her eye makeup, 
I thought up a dandy. 

I gave Cochenour a wake-up 
needle and Dorrie patted him and 
talked to him while he got his bear- 
ings. She was not a girl who carried 



a grudge. 1 did, a few. 1 got him up 
to try out his muscles faster than he 
really wanted to. His expression 
told me that they all ached. They 
worked all right, though. 

He was able to grin. “Old 
bones,” he said. “I knew I should 
have gone for the recalciphylaxis. 
That’s what happens when you try 
to save a buck.” 

He sat down heavily, the leg 
stuck out in front of him. He 
wrinkled his nose. “Sorry to 
have messed up your nice clean 
airbody,” he added. 

“You want to clean yourself up?” 

He looked surprised. “Well, I 
think I’d better pretty soon — ” 

“Do it now. I want to talk to 
you both.” 

He didn’t argue, just held out his 
hand and Dorrie took it. He 
stumped, half-hopped toward the 
clean-up. Actually Dorrie had done 
the worst of it, but he splashed a 
little water on his face and swished 
some around in his mouth. He 
was pretty well recovered when 
he turned around to look at me. 

“All right — what is it? Are we 
giving up?” 

I said, “No. We’ll do it a dif- 
ferent way.” 

Dorrie cried, “He can’t, Audee! 
Look at him. And the condition 
his suit’s in he couldn’t last out- 
side an hour — much less Help 
you dig.” 

“I know that, so we’ll have to 
change the plan. I’ll dig by myself. 
The two of you will slope off in 
the airbody.” 

“Oh, brave man,” said 
Cochenour flatly. “Who are you 
kidding? It’s a two-man job.” 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



107 




I hesitated. “Not necessarily. 
Lone prospectors have done it 
before, although the problems were 
a little different. I admit it’ll be a 
tough forty-eight for me, but we’ll 
have to try it. One reason: we 
don’t have any alternative.’’ 
“Wrong,’’ said Cochenour. He 
patted Dome’s rump. “Solid 
muscle, that girl. She isn’t big, 
but she’s healthy. Takes after 
her grandmother. Don’t argue, 
Walthers. Just think a little bit. 
It’s as safe for Dorrie as it is for 
you — and with the two of you 
there’s a chance we might luck in. 
By yourself, no chance at all.” 

For some reason his attitude put 
me in a bad temper. “You talk 
as though she didn’t have anything 
to say about it.” 

“Well,” said Dorrie, sweetly 
enough, “come to that, so do you. 
I appreciate your wanting to make 
things easy for me, Audee, but, 
honestly, I think I could help. 
I’ve learned a lot. And if you want 
the truth, you look a lot worse 
than I do.” 

I said with all the sneer I could 
get into my voice, “Forget it. You 
can, both help me for an hour or so 
while I get set up. Then we’ll do it 
my way. No arguments. Let’s 
get going.” 

T HAT made two mistakes. The 
first was that we didn’t get 
set up in an hour. It took more 
than two and I was pouring sick, 
oily sweat before we finished. I 
really felt bad. I was past hurting or 
worrying about it. I just thought it 
a little surprising every time my 
heart beat. Dorrie did more muscle 



work than I did, strong and willing 
as promised. Cochenour checked 
over the instruments and asked a 
couple of questions when he had 
to to make sure he could handle his 
part of the job, flying the airbody. 
I took two cups of coffee heavily 
laced from my private supply of 
gin and smoked my last cigarette 
for a while, meanwhile checking out 
with the military reservation. Eve 
Littleknees was flirtatious but a 
little puzzled. 

Then Dorrie and I tumbled out 
of the lock and closed it behind us, 
leaving Cochenour strapped in the 
pilot’s seat. 

Dorrie stood there for a moment, 
looking forlorn. Then she grabbed 
my hand and the two of us 
lumbered to the shelter of the 
igloo we had already ignited. I had 
impressed on her the importance of 
our being out of the wash of the 
twin-fuel jets. She was good about 
it — flung herself flat and didn’t 
move. 

I was less cautious. As soon as 
I could judge from the flare that 
the jets were angled away from us 
I stuck up my head and watched 
Cochenour take off in a sleet of 
heavy-metal ash. It wasn’t a bad 
takeoff. In circumstances like that 
I define “bad” as total demolition 
of the airbody and the death or 
maiming of one or more persons. 
He avoided those, but the airbody 
skittered and slid wildly as the 
gusts caught it. It would be a 
rough ride for him for the few 
hundred kilometers north that 
would take him out of detection 
range. 

I touched Dorrie with my toe and 



108

she struggled up. 1 slipped the 
talk cord into the jack on her 
helmet — radio was out because of 
possible perimeter patrols that we 
wouldn’t be able to see. 

“Change your mind yet?” I 
asked. 

It was , a fairly obnoxious ques- 
tion, but she took it nicely. She 
giggled. 1 could tell that because we 
were faceplate to faceplate and I 
could see her face shadowed inside 
the helmet. But I couldn’t hear 
what she was saying until she re- 
membered to nudge the voice 
switch. 

Then what I heard was: “ — ro- 
mantic, just the two of us.” 

Well, we didn’t have time for that 
kind of chitchat. I said irritably, 
“Let’s quit wasting time. Remem- 
ber what I told you. We have air, 
water and power for forty-eight 
hours. Don’t count on any margin. 
One or two of them might hold 
out a little longer, but you need all 
three to stay alive. Try not to 
work too hard. The less you metab- 
olize, the less your waste system 
has to handle. Maybe we can eat 
some of those emergency rations 
over there if we find a tunnel and 
get in — provided it’s unbreached 
and hasn’t heated up too much in 
a quarter-million years. Otherwise 
don’t even think about food. As for 
sleeping, forget — ” 

“Now who’s wasting time? You 
told me all this before.” She was 
still cheery. 

So we climbed into the igloo and 
started work. 

The first thing we had to do was 
clear out some of the tailings that 
had already begun to accumulate 



where we had left the drill going. 
The usual way, of course, is to 
reverse and redirect the augers. 
We couldn’t do that. It would 
have meant taking them away 
from cutting the shaft. We had to 
do it the hard way, namely 
manually. 

It was hard, all right. Hotsuits 
are uncomfortable to begin with. 
When you have to work in them, 
they’re miserable. When the work 
is both very hard physically and 
complicated by the cramped space 
inside an igloo that already con- 
tains two people and a working 
drill, it’s next to impossible. 

We did it anyhow, having no 
choice. 

Cochenour hadn’t lied. Dorrie 
was as good as a man. The question 
was whether that was going to be 
good enough. The other question, 
which was bothering me more and 
more every minute, was whether I 
was as good as a man. The 
headache was really pounding at 
me and I found myself blacking out 
when I moved suddenly. The 
Quackery had promised me three 
weeks before acute hepatic failure, 
but the prognosis hadn’t specified 
this kind of work. I had to figure I 
was on plus time already. That 
is a disconcerting way to figure. 

Especially when ten hours went 
by and I realized that we were down 
lower than the soundings had 
shown the tunnel to be and no 
luminous blue tailings were in 
sight. 

We were drilling a dry hole. 

I F WE had had the airbody close 
by, a dry hole would have been 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



109 




an annoyance. Maybe a big annoy- 
ance, but not a disaster. What I 
would have done was get back in 
the airbody, clean up, get a good 
night’s sleep, eat a meal and re- 
check the trace. We were digging in 
the wrong place. All right, next step 
is to dig in the right place. Study 
the terrain, pick a spot, ignite 
another igloo, start up the drills 
and try, try again. 

That was what we would have 
done. But we didn’t have the air- 
body. We had no chance for sleep 
or food. We were out of igloos. 
We didn’t have the trace to look at. 
And I was feeling lousier , every 
minute. 

I crawled out of the igloo, sat 
down in the next thing there was 
to the lee of the wind and stared at 
the scudding yellow-green sky. 

There had to be something I 
could do. I ordered myself to 
think. 

Well, let’s see. Could I maybe 
uproot the igloo and move it to 
another spot? 

No. I could break it loose, all 
right, with the augers, but the min- 
ute it was free the winds would 
catch it and it would be good-bye, 
Charlie. I would never see that ig- 
loo again. Plus there would be no 
way to make it gas-tight again. 

Well, then, how about drilling 
without an igloo? 

Possible, I judged. Pointless, 
though. Suppose we did hit lucky 
and hole in? Without an igloo to 
lock out those twenty thousand 
millibars of hot gas we would 
destroy the tunnel contents anyway. 

I felt a nudge on my shoulder and 
discovered that Dorrie was sitting 



next to me. She asked no questions, 
didn’t try to say anything at all. I 
guess it was all clear enough with- 
out talking about it. 

By my suit chronometer fifteen 
hours were gone. That left thirty- 
some before Cochenour would 
come back and get us. I didn’t see 
any point in spending it all sitting 
where we were. On the other hand, 
1 didn’t see any point in doing any- 
thing else. 

Of course, I thought, I could al- 
ways go to sleep for a while . and 
then I woke up and realized that 
that was what I had been doing. 

D ORRIE was asleep beside me. 

You may wonder how a per- 
son can sleep in the teeth of a south 
olar thermal gale. It isn’t all that 
ard. All it takes is being wholly 
worn out and wholly despairing. 
Sleeping isn’t just to knit the rav- 
eled sleeve; it is a good way to shut 
off the world when the world is too 
lousy to face. As ours was. 

But Venus is the last refuge of the 
Puritan ethic. Crazy. I knew I was 
as good as dead, but I felt I had to 
be doing something. I eased away 
from Dorrie, made sure her suit 
was belted to the hold-tight ring 
at the base of the igloo and stood 
up. It took a great deal of concen- 
tration for me to be able to stand 
up. The effort was almost as good 
at keeping out care as sleep. 

It occurred to me that there still 
might be eight or ten live Heechees 
in the tunnel and maybe they had 
heard us knocking and opened up 
the bottom of the shaft for us. So 
I crawled into the igloo to see. 

I peered down the shaft to make

IF 




sure. No. They hadn’t. It was still 
just a blind hole that disappeared 
into dirty dark invisibility at the 
end of the light from my head lamp. 
I swore at the Heechees who hadn’t 
helped us out and kicked some tail- 
ings down the shaft on their non- 
existent heads. 

The Puritan ethic was itching me 
and I wondered what I ought to do. 
Die? Well, yes, but I was doing 
that fast enough. Something 
constructive? 

I remembered that you always 
ought to leave a place the way you 
found it, so I hauled up the drills 
on the eight-to-one winch and 
stowed them neatly. I kicked some 
more tailings down the useless hole 
to make a place to sit. I sat down 
and thought. 

I mused about what we had done 
wrong, as you might think about 
a chess problem. 

I could still see the trace in my 
mind. It was bright and clear, so 
something was definitely there. It 
was just tough that we’d lucked out 
and missed it. But how? 

After some time I thought I 
knew the answer to that. 

People like Dorrie and Coche- 
nour have an idea that a seismic 
trace is like one of those under- 
ground maps of downtown Dallas, 
with all the sewers and utility con- 
duits and water pipes marked, so 
you just dig where it says and you 
find what you want. 

It isn’t exactly like that. The 
trace comes out as a sort of hazy 
approximation. It is built up, hour 
by hour, by measuring the echoes 
from the pinger. It looks like a 
band of spiderweb shadows, much 



wider than an actual tunnel and 
very fuzzy at the edges. When you 
look at it you know that somewhere 
in the shadows there is something 
that makes them. Maybe it’s a rock 
interface or a pocket of gravel. 
Hopefully it’s a Heechee dig. What- 
ever it is, it’s there somewhere, but 
you don't just know exactly where. 
If a tunnel is twenty meters wide, 
which is a fair average for a Hee- 
chee connecting link, the shadow 
trace is sure to look like fifty and 
may be a hundred. 

So where do you dig? 

That’s where the art of pros- 
pecting comes in. You have to 
make an informed guess. 

Maybe you dig in the exact geo- 
metrical center — as far as it is 
given you to see where the center 
is. That’s the easiest way. Maybe 
you dig where the shadows are 
densest, which is the way the half- 
smart prospectors do, and that 
works almost half the time. Or 
maybe you do what I did — try to 
think like a Heechee. You look at 
the trace as a whole and try to see 
what points they might have been 
trying to connect. Then you plot 
an imaginary course between them, 
where you would have put the tun- 
nel if you had been the Heechee en- 
gineer in charge, and you dig some- 
where along there. 

That was what I had done, but 
evidently I had done wrong. 

I visualized the trace. The right 
place to dig was where I had put 
down the airbody, but of course I 
had been unable to set up the igloo 
there because the airbody had been 
in the way. So I had set up about 
ten yards upslope. , 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



111 




I was convinced that ten yards 
was what had made us miss. 

I was pleased with myself for 
Figuring it out, although I couldn’t 
see that it made a lot of practical 
difference. If I had had another 
igloo I would have been glad to try 
again, assuming I could hold out 
that long. But that didn’t mean 
much, because I didn’t have an- 
other igloo. 

So I sat on the edge of the dark 
shaft, nodding sagaciously over the 
way I had solved the problem, 
dangling my legs and now and then 
sweeping in tailings. I think that 
was part of a kind of death wish, 
because I know I thought, now and 
then, that the nicest thing to do 
would be to jump in and pull the 
tailings down over me. 

The Puritan ethic stopped me. 
Anyway, suicide would have solved 
only my own personal problem. It 
wouldn’t have done anything for 
old Dorrie Keefer, snoring away 
outside in the thermal hurricane. 

I then began to wonder why I 
was worrying about Dorrie. The 
subject was pleasant to be thinking 
about, but sort of sad. 

I WENT back to considering 
about the tunnel. 

The end of the shaft couldn’t be 
more than a few yards away from 
where we had bottomed out empty. 
I thought of jumping down and 
scraping away with my bare gloves. 
It seemed like a good idea. I’m not 
sure how much was whimsy and 
how much the fantasy of a sick 
man, but I kept thinking how nice it 
would be if the Heechees were still 
in there and when I scratched into 



the blue wall material I could just 
knock politely and they would open 
up and let me in. I even had a pic- 
ture of what they looked like: sort 
of friendly and godlike. It would 
have been very pleasant to meet a 
Heechee, a live one that could 
speak English. “Heechee, what did 
you really use those things we call 
prayer fans for?’’ I could ask him. 
Or: “Heechee, have you got any- 
thing that will keep me from dying 
in your medicine chest?” Or: “Hee- 
chee, I’m sorry we messed up your 
front yard. I’ll try to clean it up.” 

1 pushed more of the tailings 
back into the shaft. I had nothing 
better to do. After a while I had the 
hole half full and had run out of 
tailings, except for the ones that 
were pushed outside the igloo and I 
didn’t have the strength to go after 
them. I looked for something else 
to do. I reset the augers, replaced 
the dull blades with the last sharp 
ones we had, pointed them in the 
general direction of a twenty-degree 
offset angle downslope and turned 
them on. 

It wasn’t until I noticed that 
Dorrie was standing next to me, 
helping me steady the augers for the 
first few yards of cut, that I realized 
I had made a plan. 

Why not try an offset cut? Did we 
have a better chance? 

We did not. We cut. 

When the drills stopped bucking 
and settled down to chew into the 
rock and we could leave them, I 
cleared a space at the side of the 
igloo and shoved tailings out for a 
while. Then we just sat there and 
watched the drills spit rock chips 
into the old shaft. It was filling up 



112 



IF 




nicely. We didn’t speak. Presently 
1 fell asleep again. 

I didn’t wake up until Dorrie 
pounded on my head. We were 
buried in tailings, but they weren’t 
just rock. They glowed blue, so 
bright they almost hurt my eyes. 

The augers must have been 
scratching at the Heechee wall liner 
for hours. They had actually worn 
pits into it. 

We looked down and we could 
see the round bright blue eye of the 
tunnel wall staring up at us. She 
was a beauty, all ours. 

Even then we didn’t speak. 

Somehow I managed to kick and 
wriggle my way through the drift to 
the crawl-through. 1 got the lock 
closed and sealed, after kicking a 
couple of cubic meters of rock 
outside. Then I began fumbling 
through the pile of refuse for the 
flame drills. Ultimately I found 
them. Somehow. Ultimately I 
managed to get them shipped and 
primed. I fired them and watched 
the bright spot of light that bounced 
out of the shaft and made a pattern 
on the igloo roof. 

Then there was a sudden short 
scream of gas and a clatter as the 
loose fragments at the bottom of 
the shaft dropped free. 

We had cut into the Heechee 
tunnel. It was unbreached and 
waiting for us. Our beauty was a 
virgin. We took her maidenhead 
with all love and reverence and 
entered her. 

XI 

I MUST have blacked out again. 
When I realized where I was I 



was on the floor of the tunnel. My 
helmet was open. So were the side- 
zips of my hotsuit. I was breathing 
stale, foul air that had to be a 
quarter-million years old and 
smelled every minute of it. But it 
was air. It was denser than Earth 
normal and a lot more humid, but 
the partial pressure of oxygen was 
about the same. It was enough to 
live on, in any case. I was proving 
that by breathing it and not dying. 

Next to me was Dorrie Keefer. 

The blue Heechee wall light didn’t 
flatter her complexion. At first I 
wasn’t sure she was breathing. But 
in spite of the way she looked her 
pulse was going, her lungs were 
functioning and when she felt me 
poking at her she opened her eyes. 

“We made it,” she said. 

We sat there grinning foolishly at 
each other, our faces Hallowe’en 
masks in the blue Heechee glow. 

To do anything more than that, 
just then, was quite impossible. I 
had my hands full just comprehend- 
ing the fact that I was alive. I 
didn’t want to endanger that odds- 
against precarious fact by moving 
around. But I wasn’t comfortable 
and after a moment I realized that 
I was very hot. I closed up my 
helmet to shut out some of the heat, 
but the smell inside was so bad that 
I opened it up again, figuring the 
heat was better. 

Then it occurred to me to wonder 
why the heat was only unpleasant, 
instead of instantly fatal. Energy 
transport through a Heechee wall- 
material surface is very slow, but 
not a quarter of a million years 
slow. My sad old brain ruminated 
on that thought for a while and 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



113 




came up with a conclusion: at least 
until quite recently, some centuries 
or thousands of years, maybe, this 
tunnel had been kept cool. Auto- 
matic machinery, of course, I 
thought sagely. Wow, that by itself 
was worth finding. Broken down or 
not, it would be worth a lot of 
fortunes. 

And that made me remember 
why we were there in the first place. 
I looked up the corridor and down, 
to see what treasures were waiting 
there for us. 

W HEN I was a school kid in 
Amarillo Central my favorite 
teacher was a crippled lady named 
Miss Stevenson. She used to tell us 
stories out of Bullfinch and Homer. 
She spoiled a whole weekend for 
me with the story of one Greek 
fellow who wanted to be a god. He 
was king of a little place in Lydia,* 
but he wanted more. The gods let 
him come to Olympus and he had it 
made until he fouled up. I forget 
how — it had something to do with a 
dog and some nasty business about 
tricking the gods into eating his 
own son. Whatever it was, they 
gave him solitary confinement for 
eternity, standing neck deep in a 
cool lake in hell and unable to 
drink. The fellow’s name was Tan- 
talus, and in that Heechee tunnel I 
had a lot in common with him. The 
treasure trove was there all right, 
but we couldn’t reach it. We hadn’t 
hit the main tunnel but a sort of 
angled, Thielly-tube detour in it, 
and it was blocked at both ends. We 
could peer past half-closed gates 
into the main shaft. We could see 
Heechee machines and irregular 



mounds of things* that might once 
have been containers, now rotted, 
their contents on the floor. But we 
hadn’t the strength to get at them. 

The suits made us clumsy. With 
them off we might have been able to 
slip through, but would we then 
have had the strength to put them 
back on again in time to meet 
Cochenour? I doubted it. I stood 
there with my helmet pressed to the 
gate, feeling like Alice peering into 
her garden without the bottle of 
drink-me— and then I thought 
about Cochenour again and 
checked the time. 

It was forty-six hours and some 
odd minutes since he had left us. He 
was due back at any time. 

And if he came back while we 
were here and opened the crawl- 
through to look for us and was 
careless about the seal at both 
ends, twenty thousand millibars of 
poison gas would hammer in on us. 
It would kill us, of course, but be- 
sides that it would damage the 
virgin tunnel. The corrosive scour- 
ing of that implosion of gas might 
wreck everything. 

“We have to go back,” I told 
Dorrie, showing her the time. She 
smiled. 

“Temporarily,” she said and 
turned and led the way. 



A FTER the cheerful blue glow of 
l the Heechee tunnel the igloo 
was cramped and miserable — and 
what was worse was that we 
couldn’t even stay inside it. Coche- 
nour probably would remember to 
lock in and out of both ends of the 
crawlthrough. But he might not. I 



114 



IF 




couldn’t take that chance. I tried to 
think of a way of plugging the shaft, 
maybe by pushing all the tailings 
back in again, but although my 
brain wasn’t working very well I 
could see that was stupid. 

So we had to wait outside in the 
breezy Venusian weather. The little 
watch dial next to my life-support 
meters, all running well into the red 
now, showed that Cochenour 
should in fact have arrived by now. 

1 pushed Dorrie into the crawl- 
through, squeezed in with her, 
locked us both through — and we 
waited. 

We waited a long time. We could 
have talked, but 1 thought she was 
either unconscious or asleep from 
the way she didn’t move — and 
anyway it seemed like an awful lot 
of work to plug in the phone jack. 

We waited longer than that, and 
still Cochenour didn’t come. 

I tried to think things through. 

There could have been a number 
of reasons for his being late. He 
could have crashed. He could have 
been challenged by the military. He 
could have gotten lost. 

But there was another possibility 
that made more sense than all of 
them. The time dial told me he was 
nearly five hours late finally and the 
life-support meters told me we were 
right up against the upper maxi- 
mum for power, near it for air, well 
past it for water. If it hadn’t been 
for our having breathed the Hee- 
chee gases for a while we would 
have been dead by then. 

He had said he was a bad loser. 
He had worked out an end-game 
maneuver so he wouldn’t have to 
lose. I could see him as clearly as 



though I were in the airbody with 
him — watching his clocks, cooking 
himself a light lunch and playing 
music while he waited for us to die. 

That was no frightening thought. 
I was close enough to dying anyway 
for the difference in methods to 
seem pretty much a technicality — 
and tired enough of being trapped 
in that foul hotsuit to be willing to 
accept almost any deliverance. But 
the girl was involved and the one 
tiny little rational thought that 
stayed in my half-poisoned brain 
was that it was unfair for Coche- 
nour to kill us both. Me, yes. Her, 
no. I beat on her suit until she 
moved a little and after some time 
I managed to make her move back 
into the crawl-through. 

There were two things Cochenour 
didn’t know. He didn’t know we 
had found breathable air and he 
didn’t know we could tap the drill 
batteries for additional power. 

In all the freaked-out fury of my 
head, I was still capable of that 
much consecutive thought. We 
could surprise him if he didn’t wait 
much longer. We could stay alive 
for a few hours more— and when he 
came to find us dead and see what 
prize we had won for him he would 
find me waiting. 



AND so he did. 

It must have been a terrible 
shock to him when he entered the 
igloo with the monkey-wrench in his 
hand, leaned over me and found 
that I was still alive and able to 
move where he had expected only a 
well-done roast of meat. The drill 
caught him right in the chest. I 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



115 




couldn't see his face, but I could 
guess at his expression. 

Then it was only a matter of 
doing four or five impossible things. 
Things like getting Dorrie up out of 
the tunnel and into the airbody. 
Like getting myself in after her, 
sealing up and setting a course. All 
these impossible things — and one 
other that was harder than all of 
them, but very important to me. 

1 totaled the airbody when we 
landed, but we were strapped in and 
suited up and when the ground 
crews came to investigate Dorrie 
and I were still alive. 



T HEY had to patch me and re- 
hydrate me for three days 
before they could even think about 
putting my new liver in. In the old 
days they would have kept me se- 
dated the whole time — now they 
kept waking me up every couple of 
hours for some feedback training 
on monitoring my hepatic flows. I 
hated it, because it was all sickness 
and pain and nagging from Dr. 
Morius and the nurses. I could 
have wished for the old days back 
again, except, of course, that in the 
old days I would have died. 

But by the fourth day I hardly 
hurt at all, except when I moved. 
And they were letting me take my 
fluids by mouth instead of the other 
way. 

I realized I was going to be alive 
for a while and looked upon my 
surroundings and found them good. 

There's no such thing as a season 
in the Spindle, but the Quackery is 
all sentimental about tradition and 
ties with the Mother Planet. They 



were playing scenes of fleecy white? 
clouds on the wall panels and the ; 
air from the ventilator ducts 
smelled of green leaves and lilac. 

“Happy spring,” I said to Dr. 
Morius. 

“Shut up,” he said, shifting a 
couple of the needles that pin- 
cushioned my abdomen and watch- 
ing the telltales. “Urn.” He pursed 
his lips, pulled out a couple of 
needles and said, “Well, let’s see, 
Walthers. We’ve taken out the 
splenovenal shunt. Your new liver 
is functioning well, although you’re 
not flushing wastes through as fast 
as you ought to. We’ve got your 
ion levels back up to something like 
a human being’s and most of your 
tissues have a little moisture in 
them again. Altogether—” he 
scratched his head — “yes, in gen- 
eral I would say you’re alive, so 
presumably the operation was a 
success.” 

“Don’t be a funny doctor,” I 
said. “When do I get out of here?” 

“Like right now?” he asked 
thoughtfully. “We could use the 
bed. Got a lot of paying patients 
coming in.” 

Now, one of the advantages of 
having blood in my brain instead of 
the poison soup it had been living 
on was that I could think reason- 
ably clearly. So I knew right away 
that he was kidding me — I wouldn’t 
have been there if I hadn’t been a 
paying patient, one way or another, 
and though I couldn’t imagine how, 
I was willing to wait a while to find 
out. 

Anyway, I was more interested in 
getting out. They packed me up in 
wetsheets and rolled me through 



116 



IF 




the Spindle to Sub Vastra’s place. 
Dorrie was there before me and the 
third of Vastra’s house fussed over 
us both, lamb broth and that flat 
hard bread they like, before tucking 
us in for a good long rest. There 
was only the one bed, but Dorrie 
didn’t seem to mind — and anyway 
at that point the question was aca- 
demic. Later on, not so academic. 
After a couple days of that I was up 
and as good as I ever was. 

By then I had found out who paid 
my bill at the Quackery. For about 
a minute I had hoped it was me, 
quickly filthy rich from the spoils 
of our tunnel, but I knew that was 
impossible. We could have made 
money only on the sly and we were 
both too near dead when we got 
back to the Spindle to conceal 
anything. 

So the military had moved in and 
taken everything, but they had 
shown they had a heart. Atrophied 
and flinty, but a heart. They had 
gone into the dig while I was still 
getting glucose enemas in my sleep. 
They had been pleased enough with 
what they found to decide that I 
was entitled to some sort of finder’s 
fee. Not much, to be sure. But 
enough to save my life. It also 
turned out to be enough to pay off 
the loosely secured checks I had 
written to finance the expedition, 
the surgical fee and hospital costs — 
and just about enough left over to 
put a down payment on a Heechee 
hut of our own. 

For a while it bothered me that 
they wouldn’t tell me what they had 
found. I even tried to get Sergeant 
Littleknees drunk when she was in 
the Spindle on furlough. But Dorrie 



was right there and how drunk can 
you get one girl when another girl is 
right there watching you? Probably 
Eve Littleknees didn’t know any- 
how. Probably no one did except a 
few weapons specialists. But it had 
to be something, because of the 
cash award — and most of all be- 
cause they didn’t prosecute for tres- 
pass on the military reservation. 
And so we get along, the two of us. 
Or three of us. 

Dorrie turned out to be good at 
selling fire-pearls to the Terry 
tourists, especially when her preg- 
nancy began to show. She kept us 
in eating money until the high 
season started and by then I found 
I was a sort of celebrity, which I 
parlayed into a bank loan and a 
new airbody, so we’re doing well 
enough. 

And I’ve promised that I will 
marry her if our kid turns out to be 
a boy, but as a matter of fact I’m 
going to do it anyway. She was a 
great help, especially with my own 
private project back there at the 
dig. She couldn’t have known what 
I wanted to bring back Cochenour’s 
body for, but she didn’t argue and, 
sick and wretched as she was, she 
helped me get it into the airbody 
lock. 

Actually I wanted it very much. 

It’s not actually a new liver, of 
course. Probably it’s not even 
second-hand. Heaven knows where 
Cochenour bought it, but I’m sure 
it wasn’t original equipment with 
him. But it works. And bastard 
though he was, I kind of liked him 
in a way and I don’t mind at all the 
fact that I’ve got a part of him with 
me always. #

*■ COMET, CAIRN AND CAPSULE 



The wanderer carried 
word from the far 
stars: Do not destroy! 



DUNCAN LUNAN 



T HREE was the magic number 
in the design of the spaceship 
Newtonian. At launch she had 
carried three reaction mass tanks 
side by side in what older designers 
still called a Titan III configura- 
tion. A and B tanks had given their 
all to rendezvous orbit insertion 



118 



and had been jettisoned, taking 
with them the auxiliary thrust 
chambers and large segments of 
radiation shielding. There remained 
the sustainer motor, pile, shielding, 
C tank — then the service module 
and crew sphere, flanked by two 
modified lunar shuttles. One was 
topped by a capsule (Penetration 
Module), the other by a winged 
Earth Lander. When the Lander 
was sunward and its shadow fell 
on the crew sphere it made the ship 
look like a ceremonial trident hang- 
ing in space. 

Inside the ship, three was any- 
thing but a magic number. Paxton 
and Schemer had taken to sleeping 
in the Lander and Penetration 
Module, respectively, to get away 
from Sullivan and each other. It 
might be because, for the first time 
ever, they were traveling at a 
velocity that would take them out 
of the solar system unless dimin- 
ished — the psychologists at Mis- 
sion Control had no other ex- 
planation for the unforeseen 
development. But the clash of 
personalities had arisen three weeks 
out from Earth and escalated over 
the weeks following. In the last 
few days the men had been meeting 
only to collect their rations at feed- 
ing time and had spoken only 
during routine checks. 

The trouble might, Schemer 
thought, have something to do with 



the visual aspect of what lay ahead. 
The comet was putting on its full 
display less than a week from peri- 
helion and the Newtonian was now 
very close indeed. The awesome 
spectacle of the tail, millions of 
miles long and beginning to curve 
as the nucleus gained speed, was 
foreshortened out of existence — 
they saw only the shockwave of 
the coma, spraying out from the 
bright spot of the nucleus, then 
pushed back by solar wind into a 
great plume against the stars. The 
ship’s slow rotation swept the head 
around the forward window like 
the sweep of a celestial radar, but 
from the side windows only a faint 
mist could be seen, fading off into 
invisibility. Something so big, but 
only seen from a distance was 
disturbing, as if the head, too, 
might vanish as they approached it. 

By now, however, more detail 
was showing. They could see shells 
and smoky patterns in the gas 
coming off the nucleus, and the 
bright star of the nucleus itself had 
become a sunlike disk with spikes 
projecting from it. Behind the 
nucleus lay a tunnel of shadow, 
blurring away at its edges until it 
vanished into the glowing haze of 
the tail. Now the coma filled all 
the sky ahead and was beginning 
to move across the field of view — 
it was time for the Newtonian to 
match orbit. Hyperbolic orbit, 



COMET, CAIRN AND CAPSULE 



119 




rare indeed — this comet was a 
stranger to our solar system and 
would never return. 

The three astronauts strapped 
into their couches and got down to 
work with a minimum of conversa- 
tion. Mission Control, too far off 
in any case to have much effect on 
the quarrels, was taking a business 
attitude — the mission had to go on, 
whatever the clash of personalities. 
The ship’s rotation was halted. 
Last refinements were applied 
to the burn computations and the 
Newtonian turned away from the 
comet. The burn was a relatively 
short one at max chamber tem- 
perature, to boost the hydrogen jet 
past the comet altogether. If 
those superheated ions impinged 
on the coma, burning into those 
fragile shells, all the scientific 
objectives could be frustrated. 
There was no chance the crew 
would let that happen, would take 
out resentments on the celestial 
body each man’s specialty was 
now in absolute priority as far 
as he was concerned. 

They were much nearer the 
comet when Schemer saw it next 
from the observation turret on the 
crew sphere, as the ship turned 
back to face it. The fuming gases 
around it seemed motionless, but 
after some minutes changes 
could be detected. The dazzling 
spikes around the nucleus were no 



longer sharp, but still too blurred 
overall by intervening gas and ice 
crystals for the telescope to 
resolve them. Probing with radar 
and laser beams, Paxton could tell 
even less about them — he was 
getting a general reflection from a 
layer about double the size of the 
nucleus, which by visual estimate 
was six hundred miles across. 
Schemer suspected that the spikes 
were internal reflections in a cloud 
of ice fragments orbiting the 
nucleus, but the changing light 
patterns he detected might just be 
due to the movement of gases out 
and back. 

“At any rate,” he reported, “I 
can’t see any obvious hazards to 
penetration.” 

“Radar seems to confirm that,” 
Paxton broadcast. “The boundary 
layer I’m getting seems to be quite 
clearly defined. If we follow the 
programed approach we won’t 
run suddenly into any problems.” 

T HEY waited, still moving 
slowly toward the comet, for 
the signal to journey to Earth and 
the reply to amble back. A great 
deal of power was going into the 
Newtonian signal, to overcome 
their narrow separation from the 
sun. Interference had proved un- 
expectedly serious and Sullivan’s 
clamp-down on personal messages 
had been the first source of friction

aboard. It wasn’t as if they were 
overworking fuel cells, with power 
coming direct from the pile, and 
Schemer suspected that Sullivan, 
himself unmarried, was actively 
jealous of their daily hook-up to 
their homes. Mission Control 
should have realized that a man 
without a wife and children could 
be most homesick of all and should 
have arranged for someone to talk 
personally to the mission com- 
mander. But Schemer could hardly 
suggest that on open circuit with 
Sullivan right beside him. So Sul- 
livan kept all radio time for busi- 
ness and Schemer and Paxton lost 
a valued link with home. 

The Mission Control bleep 
sounded. “Roger, no visible haz- 
ards. We agree that you should 
prepare for penetration. Confirm 
launch readiness for final go/no 
go decision, over.” Bleep. 

“Okay, Dave,” said Schemer, 
speaking directly to Paxton for the 
first time today. He didn’t have 
much against Paxton, really, but 
he always felt he was talking across 
Sullivan when he addressed him. 
Perhaps the same feeling ac- 
counted for Paxton’s incivility. 
“Why don’t you move across into 
the PM and I’ll follow you 
through.” He put the lens caps 
back on the turret instruments and 
stowed them for the next decelera- 
tion, then pulled himself feet-first 

COMET, CAIRN AND CAPSULE 



into the center section of the 
sphere. Sullivan didn’t speak as he 
worked his way across, so neither 
did he. 

Personnel selection had been 
almost wholly successful, he con- 
ceded as they checked out the 
Penetration Module. In space 
fiction (he’d never time to read any, 
but he knew just what it was like) 
at least one member of the crew 
had to be a maniac, an agoraphobe 
or something equally hard to de- 
tect, bent on aborting the mission 
five minutes after liftoff. But 
though the longest space flight 
yet had fallen down on compati- 
bility, the conflict didn’t even 
touch the mission program. After 
his unreasonable ruling on the 
signals Sullivan had found it 
necessary to impose his authority 
in a string of minor matters, 
probably because he knew he had 
been unreasonable. He, Paxton and 
Schemer had worked up a real 
dislike of one another, but they 
weren’t thinking of curtailing the 
flight. 

There was a way to curtail the 
flight, but it was intended for more 
serious difficulty than this. After 
perihelion they had an “abort 
window,” a chance to fire the 
motor and drop right back, return- 
ing to Earth three months later. 
Otherwise, riding outward with 
the comet as they studied it, they 

121 




would make their separation burn 
not far from Earth’s orbit and 
meet Earth itself nine months later. 
Fifteen months’ voyage, or six — 
and they were going for fifteen 
without hesitation. 

There could still be a scientific 
payoff if they had to abort. The 
Lander’s cargo space contained 
payload at present, a much less 
sophisticated payload than the 
PM’s. If manned penetration of 
the comet proved impossible they 
could launch a nuclear device 
which, hopefully sinking to the 
nucleus before detonation, would 
supply some of the data they hoped 
to get less violently from penetra- 
tion. The experimental package 
— in effect, a complete space 
probe — they would leave behind. 

T HE checks went through with- 
out incident and they received 
a go for launch. They counted 
down the separation and Paxton 
turned the craft for Sullivan’s 
visual inspection. Then they moved 
out laterally and Sullivan turned 
the Newtonian around once more. 
The final burn was gentle, the 
flaring gases missing the PM and 
the comet, bringing the spaceship 
to rest in the observation station 
it would hold for the next fourteen 
days. The PM traveled on with its 
original momentum, toward the 



hazed brilliance of the cometary 
nucleus. 

There was no spectacle or sensa- 
tion when they entered the coma. 
Like the end of the rainbow, the 
smoky plumes of gas receded and 
dissolved before them. Bip; little by 
little the glow around the nucleus 
spread above them and below, 
waxing brighter and separating into 
bars and columns. Now the spikes 
were breaking up, visually, into 
discrete sources, tens, dozens, hun- 
dreds, each one brilliantly reflect- 
ing the sunlight along spikes of its 
own. By the time the streamers of 
haze completely surrounded the 
capsule the nucleus ahead was a 
lattice of light beams with what 
seemed to be a second sun at its 
heart. 

“We’re going to slow the ship,” 
Paxton reported, activating fly-by- 
wire. “Much of what looked solid 
from outside is separating now. 
There’s a huge shell of ice frag- 
ments, probably orbiting in 
clusters, though gravity’s so low 
you can’t detect it. If the nucleus 
itself were more massive we’d 
probably get a ring like Saturn’s. 
As it is, I don’t see any problems in 
continuing penetration — we can 
treat this stuff as weightless and 
stationary.” 

They burned their chemical 
motors to slow up — only briefly, 
for gravitational acceleration was 



122 



IF 




negligible. Making less than five 
hundred miles an hour, the PM 
traveled into the three-dimensional 
ice field. 

The “descent” was okay — they 
could see the solid-appearing sur- 
face they were making for and 
bodies in their path separated 
visually and on radar in plenty of 
time to be avoided. Waves of sun- 
driven gas passed them from the 
huge bergs. 

“By dead reckoning we're two 
hundred miles inside,” Paxton 
radioed. The PM’$ signals were 
being relayed through the Newton- 
ian to Earth (another reason for 
the ship’s sunward position) and 
they had had loss-of-signal several 
times as they passed floating 
masses. “The concentration of 
material is increasing and we’re 
cutting speed right now with 
another thirty-second burn. As 
well as ice masses we’re now seeing 
dark, rocky fragments, from which 
all the gases must have sublimed 
away. They’re all of considerable 
size, up to hundreds of feet across. 
Our micrometeor counters have 
not registered any significant 
increase in impacts — from which 
I’d deduce that the smaller rock 
fragments are being carried out 
into the tail by sunlight pressure 
and solar wind. This would seem to 
confirm the origin of meteors along 
comctary orbits.” 



“Roger, Dave,” Mission Con- 
trol said eventually. “We’re happy 
with your fuel consumption, as 
indicated by Mike’s last set of 
figures, but there’s some anxiety 
here about your frequent use of 
vernier and braking engines. Your 
last bum should reduce the need 
for frequent restarts. Of course 
each engine should be able to take 
several hundred separate burns, 
but we’d like you to keep to fewer, 
longer bums if possible.” 

This was a problem they had 
foreseen. In a stronger gravity 
field, descending, they could have 
kept the motors burning steadily at 
low thrust — but for an approach to 
the comet, with the drawn-out 
penetration through the rock and 
ice field, they would have had to 
come in much too fast. Conversely, 
if they had started slowly enough 
to make the penetration on attitude 
control jets, entry would have taken 
far too long. But by now the situa- 
tion had changed. 

“We’re nearing shoals — that’s 
the best way I can put it,” said 
Paxton. “There’s a lot of loose stuff 
ahead, forming an inclined plane 
across our line of penetration. I’d 
say it’s material that broke away 
from the nucleus in the first major 
solar heating, before the coma be- 
gan to form and scatter the incident 
radiation. This ahead of us is the 
lighter stuff, beginning to drift 



COMET, CAIRN AND CAPSULE 



L23 




backward as the cloud of new 
fragments takes up a conical shape. 
Its transverse velocity is pretty well 
negligible and we should go through 
without trouble. We’re going now 
to continuous vernier bum.” 

T AIL first, motors idling, they 
slid through the final barrier. 
Paxton held the ship confidently on 
fly-by-wire, turning the gimbaled 
verniers for brief bursts to avoid 
denser clouds of fragments. 
Visibility was poorer, with so many 
reflecting surfaces around that they 
were back to the lattice effect, soft- 
ened now by the greater density of 
gases. Then, suddenly, the jeweled 
reefs were above them and they 
began their final braking. 

“We’re now in the lee of the true 
nucleus, starting our final ap- 
proach. The body looks to be 
loosely compacted chunks of rock 
and ice. Gravity is very low. The 
streams of gas and pieces breaking 
away are all coming from the area 
under direct sunlight. The surface 
appears stable along a broad strip 
toward the terminator.” 

“I’m getting a really bright radar 
echo from about two-thirds of the 
way up the terminator,” Schemer 
added. “We have enough fuel to 
select that for our touchdown.” 
Paxton began the course change. 
“If it’s an anomaly we’ll want a 
look at that.” 



The radar anomaly stayed con- 
spicuous as the PM closed with it. 
“That’s a bright echo,” Schemer 
repeated. “It could almost be a 
metal outcrop.” 

“I’ll land as close to it as il can. 
There’s a promising site right next 
to the thing. I can see it now — it 
does look like metal. Put the radar 
into landing mode.” 

“Landing mode activated.” 

The icy horizon came up around 
them as Paxton throttled back. 
Ignoring the feeble attraction of 
the nucleus, he was flying the ship 
all the way to the surface. He shut 
off the braking engine and let the 
remnants of their approach velocity 
take them down. Schemer was call- 
ing off the approach figures, so he 
didn’t see the anomaly come into 
view. Paxton did — and he inter- 
rupted the commentary. 

“Control, the anomaly is arti- 
ficial. I say again, the anomaly is 
an artificial object. We are go for 
touchdown, well within fuel re- 
serves — contact light.” 

“Contact light is on,” Schemer 
confirmed. “The PM has landed. 
Our inclination is three degrees, 
repeat three degrees. Fuel and 
oxidizer residuals as follows . .” 

T HEY were through the landing 
checks and had given them- 
selves go for a three-minute stay 
when the Earth reaction came 



124 



IF 




back. “We’re getting pretty bad 
interference on your signal now, 
especially in the final stage of 
descent. Repeat description of the 
anomaly, repeat description of 
the anomaly.’’ Bleep . 

“I say again, the anomaly is an 
artificial object, repeat artificial. 
Now here we go for the details.” 
Turning to the right, Paxton could 
just see the thing from his couch. 
“It looks like the bottom half of a 
totem pole. I’d say there are three 
distinct sections, one on top of the 
other. The bottom one is gold — or 
covered in gold foil— cylindrical, 
with heat radiator panels project- 
ing. The one above that is roughly 
spherical, black and silver, with 
solar cell panels on the surface 
and projecting antennae. The top 
section is hexagonal for three- 
fourths of the way up — then it 
becomes a straight cylinder of 
lesser diameter. It, too, is gold and 
some of the panels of the hexagon 
have solar cells. There are con- 
necting rods from it on one side, 
anchoring it to the bottom section 
— I don’t think they touch the 
sphere at all.” 

“We have your landing status 
report,” said Misson Control. “On 
the basis of that we’ll give you go to 
stay for twelve hours. Let us have 
your computer readout and we’ll 
assess status for the full mission.” 
Bleep . 



“Roger,” said Schemer. “Sec- 
ondary antenna is now deployed 
and locked on Newtonian for 
telemetry. Computer readout be- 
gins in three seconds, two, one, 
mark!” He pressed the switch and 
the transmission light went on. 

The reply to Paxton’s description 
came back. “We copy the appear- 
ance of the object, Dave. Can you 
estimate the function or purpose 
of the device?” Bleep . 

Paxton was still staring to the 
right. “The more I look at it, the 
more I think it’s not one device 
but three. The three sections cer- 
tainly don’t add up to a unit like 
the three segments of the PM. Nor, 
I think, is any one section a space- 
craft in itself. I’d say each of them 
is a scientific package like the one 
in our cargo compartment, over.” 

“We have your computer read- 
out,” said Misson Control. “You 
are go to stay for the full mis- 
sion.” Bleep. 

“Great. Now let me see this 
thing.” Schemer pushed off his 
straps and sat up on his couch, 
then rose and turned to see out 
through the port. Paxton sat up 
more slowly. They both looked out 
in silence until Control came back 
on. 

“Dave, we could accept that 
some other national group might 
have reached the comet some days 
ahead of us. But there hasn’t been 



COMET, CAIRN AND CAPSULE 



125 




time for three complete scientific 
payloads to be landed even if three 
ships the size of Newtonian could 
be launched in secret.” Bleep. 

“Roger, Control, that confirms 
our assessment,” said Paxton. 
Schemer glanced at him in surprise. 
“We’re looking at objects from 
outside the solar system altogether, 
like the comet itself. Some time in 
the past, when the nucleus swung 
past another sun, there was another 
landing here— maybe more than 
one.” 

“If that’s true,” said Schemer, 
“then the object might be millions 
of years old. This is a fast comet, 
but over interstellar distances — ” 

“Not less than, a million years,” 
Paxton agreed. “Well,, let’s eat.” 

“Huh? Oh, yes.” Their program 
called for a meal and a sleep period. 
The discovery had knocked Scher- 
ner out of the routine, though he 
hadn’t been thinking of going out- 
side. The penetration descent had 
left him fatigued, but he could have 
looked at the object a long time 
yet. “Okay, you break out the food 
packs and I’ll get some pictures 
through the window.” 

He even took some shots from 
the other windows — of the comet’s 
surface composition and the bright 
columns of gas rising past the sun’s 
disk from over the horizon. The 
sublimation mechanism was his 
speciality, was what he had come 



here to study, but it was taking 
second place in his thoughts. 

W HEN they awoke they de- 
pressurized the module and 
Paxton made his way carefully 
down the side of the ship. Gravity 
was so low that effectively they 
were in free-fall, but the exhausts 
had softened the surface enough for 
the landing legs to grapple and 
hold. Schemer waited in the hatch 
while Paxton collected a contin- 
gency sample from the surface, 
sent it back up on his line — then 
he opened up the cargo section and 
began passing down the research 
tools. After he descended they 
were to start taking cores and 
putting down probes into the 
comet, but obviously that had to 
wait. Taking the cameras, they 
maneuvered on their jet packs to- 
ward the object. 

It was roughly the same height 
as the Penetration Module, but all 
three sections were greater than 
it in diameter. Schemer had 
thought, in the capsule, that it was 
somewhat smaller, but sizes and 
distances were hard to judge. The 
irregular horizon was close every- 
where, but there was a big outcrop 
of ice behind the object and light 
reflected from the crag lit up the 
side away from the sun, giving 
the structure a luminous, ethereal 
quality. Close up, they could see 



126 



IF 




that the bottom section was clear 
of the surface. In the shadow be- 
neath it their torches found a 
great golden spike, anchored deep 
among the frozen gases of the 
comet. 

“Whoever put down the first 
one meant it to hold,” said Paxton 
to Earth. “From the taper on the 
length we can see, which is about 
four feet, I would estimate that 
the spike would hold through at 
least one stellar passage even on 
the sunward side of the comet. 
Maybe the makers knew where the 
comet was going next and decided 
to use it as an interstellar probe. 
These radiator panels imply that 
there was a big power plant in here, 
enough to carry a signal over inter- 
stellar distances — maybe beaming 
its accumulated data once it got 
well out from the star again. It 
could be storing information to do 
so again right now, but the panels 
are at exactly the temperature of 
our surroundings, so I’d guess the 
pile’s wholly inert. It’s had mil- 
lions of years to cool right down.” 

“Better say tens of millions, or 
even hundreds,” Schemer corrected 
from above. “Once the probe was 
beyond use to its makers, it served 
as an anchorage for other people’s. 
The spheroid was welded to its 
top, covering the antenna unit.” 

“And the top section was added 
later still,” said Paxton. “When I 



said the three didn’t make anything 
in combination, I was wrong. What 
we have here is a cairn.” 
“Fantastic.” Schemer was float- 
ting by the upper unit, taking 
pictures. “These upper two could 
still be active, Dave, since they 
have solar cells. Maybe they’re 
recording data on us right now.” 
“If the solar cells are still active 
after a million years in the inter- 
stellar dark they’re pretty good,” 
said Paxton. “But if they have 
omnidirectional antennae — maybe 
we’ll pick up something when 
we’re tracking our own instrument 
package.” 

“That would be fantastic! If we 
could compare their transmissions 
with our probe’s we could maybe 
decode them. Then perhaps we 
could interrogate them about the 
planetary systems they originally 
passed through. It would be an in- 
terstellar probe for us — a time 
probe as well as a space one!” 
“Great,” said Paxton. “If we 
could get the second probe’s record- 
ing of the third probe’s system we’d 
get some actual data about the peo- 
ple who put the third probe here.” 
But closer examination proved 
these speculations mere dreams. 
All three probes were inert, so 
thoroughly frozen that the ice crys- 
tals frosting them could not be 
brushed off. Schemer and Paxton 
feared to apply any force, for the 

127 



COMET, CAIRN AND CAPSULE 




whole structure might shatter — the 
metals had to be nightmarishly 
brittle. There didn’t seem to be 
any prospect of taking the probes 
apart, not even of removing data 
recorders that might be slowly 
warmed and interrogated. They 
could find no access panels — not 
surprisingly. Their own probe was 
a sealed unit, almost all solid- 
state, so its power would last as 
long as possible on the outward 
swing from the sun. They had no 
burning or cutting tools to force a 
way into the cairn — like their 
predecessors, they could only leave 
their own instruments in turn. 

T HE work of studying the comet 
went on as intended. Schemer 
floated farther sunwards day by 
day, taking rock and ice samples, 
studying the gas flow from the 
surface and the effects of the coma 
on sunlight and solar wind. Using 
a one-man jet platform, he pene- 
trated The region where fragments 
were splitting off the comet, even 
landing there as the violence of the 
outbursts diminished. The comet 
was receding swiftly from the sun 
now, preceded by the vast length of 
the tail which would soon contract. 

They were coming up to activa- 
tion time for the automatic station 
they would leave behind. One 
question remained to be settled, 
however. It seemed fitting to add 



the package to the top of the cairn, 
but the plan had been to anchor it 
to the ice. It had been designed to 
“listen” for tremors and shifts of 
components in the comet as the 
sunward face stabilized — obviously 
these would be affected by trans- 
mission through the cairn. It was 
also intended to measure the rate 
of “ice fall” as the coma gases 
froze and their crystals were drawn 
back to the nucleus. That was less 
of a problem, because the precipi- 
tation on the upper face of the 
probe could be corrected for the 
height of the cairn, to give the 
values for the comet’s surface. 
However, Mission Control had 
been holding up the decision. 

When they did return to the 
subject, they had something very 
different in mind. “From the di- 
mensions you’ve given us for the 
cylinder atop the cairn, it would 
be possible to grip it with the land- 
ing legs of the PM.” 

Schemer and Paxton looked at 
each other. Paxton raised his 
eyebrows. “That would be possible, 
Control,” he replied. “We could 
lower the PM to the top of the cairn 
on the attitude control jets and 
tighten up the landing legs. We 
might even get a weld, with two 
metal surfaces pressed together in 
vacuum — but I wouldn’t expect 
the grip to hold if we tried to pull 
the cairn out of the ice.” 



128 



IF 




“Surely that’s not what they have 
in mind,” Schemer said as they 
waited for the signals to course 
out and back. 

“I can’t think of what else they 
want,” said Paxton. “We couldn’t 
use the central engine, but the four 
verniers could be angled sufficiently 
to keep the flames from impinging 
on the cairn. Maybe they want us 
to bring back the top section— but 
we haven’t enough fuel even for 
that.” 

Schemer nodded. Neither of 
them put his own feelings into 
words — by now they were of one 
mind concerning the cairn. 

Mission Control replied. “As 
you may imagine, Dave, there’s a 
big demand from scientists — and 
indeed from the public and their 
elected representatives— that the 
cairn be retrieved for study. The 
only way we can figure to do this 
involves sacrificing the back-up 
capability of the PM and the 
Lander, so the final decision will 
rest with Bob Sullivan as mission 
commander. What we plan is for 
Bob to come down to you in the 
Lander and set the nuclear device 
in the ice at the edge of the current 
break-up zone. We calculate that 
an explosion at that point has the 
best chance of blasting the cairn 
out of the nucleus. Then we hope 
that you’d be able to get remote 
control of the PM and slow up the 



cairn with the vernier engines. 
With your present fuel reserves, it 
should return to the vicinity of the 
sun within a hundred years. We’d 
like to know whether you have any 
additional comments before we 
go to Bob for his decision.” Bleep. 

Paxton looked at Schemer. “You 
tell them,” he said, looking sick. 
“I can’t.” 

Schemer swallowed hard. “Noth- 
ing to add. Control. Over.” 

AFTER weighing up all the 
A factors Sullivan accepted 
the plan — surprising neither Pax- 
ton nor Schemer. His solo penetra- 
tion of the comet posed no real 
problems because he knew what 
to expect. Only the landing might 
be tricky and for that he would 
have a talk-down. In due course 
they saw the bright flare of the 
Lander motors descending through 
the inclined belt of debris (bigger 
fragments now, more widely 
spaced), and with Schemer on 
the PM radar and Paxton out- 
side, they talked him down without 
trouble. 

Atop its booster, identical to the 
PM’s, the winged Lander made 
an equilateral triangle with the 
PM and the cairn. Sullivan went 
through the routine checks on his 
own, then suited up immediately 
for EVA. 

Paxton helped him out and to- 



COMET, CAIRN AND CAPSULE 



129 




gether they drifted across to the 
cairn. Schemer was already there, 
waiting for them. They floated 
slowly up the structure, both 
scientists trying to read the mission 
commander’s mind. 

At the top of the cairn Sullivan 
cut his jets and hung there, sinking 
imperciptibly in the gravity of the 
nucleus. “I thought it might be an 
anticlimax,” he said at last, “but 
that thing is absolutely beautiful. 
Not just in itself, though it has a 
strange unity of its own, but in all 
that it stands for.” 

“So it’s got to you as well,” 
Schemer said inadequately. 

“Yeah. Do you think it will sur- 
vive disruption of the nucleus?” 

“I doubt it.” Paxton pointed to 
the ice bulk beyond. “That berg 
alone could crush it— just with the 
wallop it would pack tumbling 
over. That bomb is going to break 
loose everything. I don’t think we’ll 
even find the cairn again — there’ll 
be nothing left of it to find.” 

“They only asked us whether it 
could be set up,” Schemer said. 
“Not whether we thought it would 
work — or whether we should even 
try to retain the cairn. Earth wants 
and Earth grabs — they’d sooner 
smash the cairn than let it go — if 
they can’t have it.” 

Sullivan shook his head. “Yeah. 
It’s too bad.” 

“Come and see what Dave has 



been doing,” Schemer said to him. 

“What Dave has been doing?” 
Sullivan asked as they floated 
towards the PM. “Wait a minute 
— you fellows have been falling 
behind on the EVA program — ” 

“I’ve been doing most of that 
lately,” Schemer said wearily. 
“Sure, it might have been a little 
risky for me to work far from the 
ship on my own, but I stayed high 
enough either with the platform 
or on the suit jets to be in touch 
with Dave, except when I dropped 
to take samples. If I hadn’t called 
in every thirty minutes he would 
have come for me.” 

The PM was before them, the 
four panels folded down from the 
cargo hold like the armored ruff of 
some giant reptile. Paxton hung 
over the first of them, indicating 
his painstaking work on the interior 
of the panel. 

“I brought down the rendezvous 
laser, unshipped from its housing, 
and refocused it,” he said. “We 
can’t use it to cut into the cairn be- 
cause we don’t have a long enough 
power line — but it can engrave 
these panels before we blow them 
clear. We were going to mount 
them around our station on top 
of the cairn. On this one I’ve put 
the sun, the Earth’s orbit and the 
comet’s — and the Newtonian s 
path to the comet and back. I put 
the moon beside the Earth so they 



130 



IF 




could identify Earth in this second 
diagram at the side.” He had 
shown the planets of the solar sys- 
tem to scale, with their distances 
from the sun in astronomical units. 
“I’ve marked Earth E and the sun 
S, so ES is the astronomical unit, 
and I’ve put our numbers up to 
twenty-one along the bottom here 
so they can work them out. I 
couldn’t figure any way to give 
them the actual distances, but at 
least they can chart the solar sys- 
tem to scale. 

“The next two,” he pointed, “are 
star charts, north and south. I 
haven’t put much stress on con- 
stellation figures because it’ll be 
who knows how long before the 
comet goes through another in- 
habited system, but I’ve shown the 
relative positions of the Milky 
Way, the Galactic Poles, M thirty- 
one, M thirteen and other globu- 
lars, the Hyades, the Pleiades and 
the Magellanic Clouds. With those 
points of reference people should 
be able to place where we were and 
when — even the open clusters 
should be good markers for a 
galactic year or so, provided they 
can be identified. That’s for their 
scientists. The message is ‘Here we 
are’ and it doesn’t matter that 
astronomical distances make it 
‘Here we were.’” 

After drifting around the hull 
Sullivan met Paxton again at the 



fourth panel. “This one should give 
them the identification,” Paxton 
said. “That’s the Milky Way— 
the cross in it shows our position 
now. There are the Magellanics 
and there’s Andromeda. I’ve 
started dotting in some globular 
clusters to show what they are. 
The Pleiades and the rest are 
obviously open clusters, by elim- 
ination. Down here I’m going to 
put a stylized man, woman and 
child, to show what we’re like.” 
“Dave, those are incredible,” 
said Sullivan at last. 

“I’ve put a lot into them,” said 
Paxton. “If you didn’t feel as we 
do about the cairn I might not be 
showing them to you. We could 
have blown them off and you’d 
never have known.” 

“Nobody will ever know, if we 
blow up the comet,” said Sullivan. 
“That’s what you’re trying to tell 
me. We have a chance to add to 
what other intelligent races have 
begun — ” He fell silent for a mo- 
ment. “Well, I’ve always heard 
that it was bad luck to break the 
chain. But at this stage, if we don’t 
plant the bomb wfe’ll obviously be 
defying Mission Control.” Sud- 
denly he grinned. “There’s a way 
around that. Let’s get moving — 
we’ll mount the PM on the cairn, 
as ordered, and take pictures to 
prove it. While Dave finishes the 
fourth panel, we tell Control that 



COMET, CAIRN AND CAPSULE

we’re planting the bomb sunward, 
where they want it. Instead we’ll 
take it up with us for the first 
stage of the ascent and cast it off 
when it has enough speed to leave 
the comet altogether. The excess 
fuel we use for that first burn will 
cancel the excess we didn’t use 
planting the charge.” 

T ^EY moved the PM, instru- 
ment package and all, to hover 
above the cairn and this time 
Sullivan outside talked Paxton 
and Schemer down. With the leg 
grapples securely gripping the top 
cylinder, the PM looked entirely 
right sitting up there. The probe’s 
antennae and instrument booms 
were extended and the package 
was activated. They were ready 
to contact Mission Control when 
they discovered they had lost 
touch with Earth. The Newtonians 
high-gain antennae had drifted 
off the planet, the nucleus, or both. 
Probably the nucleus sensors had 
wandered off along the illusory 
spikes. The brilliant lattice over- 
head was opening now, beginning 
to separate into discrete objects 
reflecting the sunlight., 

Paxton and Schemer backed out 
of the capsule, bringing their few 
belongings. The men gathered at 
the Lander hatch, pulling them- 
selves through it into the cabin. 
Sealing it up and pressurizing, they 



left ice and vacuum behind for the 
last time. 

Central engine at low thrust, 
verniers flaring, the Lander made 
its way up through the inclined 
plane of fragments. Beyond it, 
coasting outward, Sullivan let the 
bomb go. It drew ahead on its 
own solid charge, fast enough to 
separate entirely from the comet. 
By the time the comet next came to 
a solar system the device would be 
too far away to be associated 
with it. 

A floating iceberg was growing 
in the path of the Lander. Sullivan 
started the second bum. Threading 
a path through the satellites of the 
nucleus, the verniers fired again 
and again until one of them 
cracked. 

A cluster of red lights came on, 
the warning buzzer sounded, and 
the ship was tumbled by the 
asymmetric thrust generated by 
the burn-out. Cut-off was auto- 
matic and fly-by-wire brought the 
ship back into the bum attitude. 

“Rate of approach to nearest 
hazard,” Sullivan demanded. 

“Distance one point four miles 
— three minutes to impact,” 
Schemer reported. 

“Number three vernier has 
gone,” said Sullivan. “We’ll take 
a systems check on the others be- 
fore we burn. Give it to me from 
item thirty-one, Dave.” 



132 



IF 




Out of touch with Mission Con- 
trol, they had to get themselves 
through the emergency. They 
completed the check with a minute 
and a half to spare and made the 
next burn on the central engine 
alone. The approaching ice cliff, 
spread with gemlike points, slid 
past. 

Sullivan studied the reefs ahead. 
“We’ll have to take some way off 
this thing,” he declared. “Set up a 
twenty-second bum for the central 
engine, Dave.” He drew back 
the hand-grip for a 180 -degree 
rotation. 

“We’re going to be late back to 
the Newtonian said Schemer. 

“Mission Control will sweat,” 
Sullivan agreed. “They think an 
atom bomb’s going off down here. 
But they won’t tell your families 
until they do hear from us, I 
expect.” 

Depenetration was much harder 
now. With one vernier out of ac- 
tion, more work would fall on the 
central engine and the three ver- 
niers remaining. They could either 
angle the ship for each burn, load- 
ing work on to the central engine, 
or roll to bring the other verniers 
to bear when the missing one was 
needed. To conserve fuel in the 
attitude control thrusters, in fact, 
they must use the verniers as much 
as possible — but with all those roll 
maneuvers they could get off the 



Newtonian beam. And if they 
emerged low on fuel there was no- 
one to come and get them. Control 
had become a three-man job and 
the team clicked smoothly together. 

Schemer, on radar and com- 
munications, kept them headed in 
the right direction. They emerged 
into the coma in approximately 
the right place and not long after- 
ward the Newtonian s radio link 
locked onto them again. The Land- 
er moved out toward clear space. 

Control came on: “We were 
getting worried about you fellows 
for a while there, but you should 
get back to the Newtonian and 
move out some distance before the 
explosion.” Bleep. 

“Roger, Control,” said Sullivan. 
“What will we tell them when 
there’s no detonation?” he asked 
the others. 

“No detonation,” said Paxton. 

“Right,” said Sullivan and they 
all smiled, relaxed after the strain 
of the ascent. 

Their hostility to one another 
was gone, Schemer realized — 
it hadn’t reared its head during 
stress or even after. The discovery 
of the cairn had overshadowed it 
and dissolved it. That was the rea- 
son — though the message had not 
yet reached Earth — why the cairn 
had to remain intact, singing or 
silent, on its way among the stars.

COMET, CAIRN AND CAPSULE 



133 





F OR more than forty years, 
readers and writers have been 
unable to agree on a definition of 
science fiction that would separate 
it from the general field of pure 
fantasy. Most early attempts at 
a definition relied upon science 
as the essential element in science 
fiction. But that effort failed. Some 
of the best science-fiction stories 
involve almost no science, while 
C. P. Snow used a great deal of 
science in some of his mainstream 
novels. Speculation isn’t the key 
word, because fantasy is also 
speculative. Extrapolation? No, 
because you can’t extrapolate a 
galaxy of aliens — we don’t know 
anything about aliens, so we 
can’t honestly extrapolate from 
zero knowledge. 



In effect we have been forced to 
fall back on a circular definition 
or no definition at all. Science 
fiction has often been considered 
to be simply what science-ficton^ 
readers like — and a science-fiction 
reader is one who likes science 
fiction. And around she goes. Most 
often we have simply assumed that 
everyone concerned with science 
fiction knows what the term means 
even if he can’t define it. 

If that idea was ever valid, it 
most certainly is not today. 

I recently completed the editing 
of an anthology entitled Best 
Science Fiction Stories of the 
Year , to be published by Dutton. 
I had to read every piece of short 
(to 10,000 words) science fiction 
that was published during 1971 



134 




in the magazines and original 
anthologies. 

1 found some very good stories, 
but they were buried in a shocking 
mass of stuff that offered very 
little reason for its existence. I 
kept no records, yet at least half of 
what I read (particularly in the 
anthologies) was everything but 
science fiction. Much of it wasn’t 
even fantasy. The writers had 
somehow learned enough of the 
field to locate the markets, but — 
if they ever read a science- 
fiction magazine — they didn’t un- 
derstand the basic nature of the 
medium. 

It seemed to me that I must 
include a definition in the foreword 
to the book, so that readers would 
know what to expect. I spent a 
week trying to find such a defini- 
tion and then had to start from 
scratch — to discover what science 
fiction is not. 

Science fiction is not fantasy. 
It should not deal with what is 
known to be impossible. It need 
not involve high probabilities, but 
such things as shrinking the world 
to the atom won’t work — we know 
too much of atomic structure and 
there are no electron “worlds.” 
Magic won’t work, unless fitted 
carefully into the structure of 
known science. 

(There is a catch to the above, 
of course. Time travel and faster- 



than-light travel are pretty dubious 
possibilities and they are often 
used with no attempt to fit them 
into our known science. Conven- 
tion, however, has accepted both as 
devices that facilitate the telling of 
certain stories. Telepathy and the 
psi powers have been similarly 
accepted.) 

Rationality should be a require- 
ment of all fiction — but science 
fiction especially must not be 
irrational. You can’t set up a story 
of the sun about to explode and 
then solve the problem by sending 
out a fire rocket to spray the sun 
with water and quench the flame. 
You can’t set up a projection into 
the future made possible only by 
science and then neglect science. 
You have to think out whatever 
probabilities you choose, attempt 
to see all the ramifications, build 
your world as completely as you 
can and then follow through within 
the limits you have given that 
world. Item: rationality. 

I did come up with one pos- 
itive. Science fiction is fiction — it 
deals in stories, not sketches or 
jottings. A story must feature a 
character who undergoes stress 
through inner or exterior conflict 
and creates a resolution, either 
happy or significantly unhappy. 
The common rules of fiction apply 
to science fiction — in fact, they 
apply even more strongly, since 



THE READING ROOM 



135 




the writer frequently must create 
acceptance or identification rather 
than find it in a commonly accepted 
background. Item: fiction. 

It took me several days to find 
the one factor that was still 
missing. Most of the above could 
apply to any good mainstream 
story. What made the difference? 
Suddenly I realized that science 
fiction never occurs in the past, the 
present, the future. In true science 
fiction something has to be dif- 
ferent from what we know of the 
past or present— and no future is 
sure. We can project merely a 
future. 

So science fiction deals with 
alternates. A story detailing our 
normal present — or actual past — 
set in the near future and moved 
to a geographic locale not on any 
map is still mainstream. But a story 
rationally developed out of racial 
riots in a present — and in which 
the South won the War between the 
States in science fiction. So is any 
honest attempt to write about a 
future. Item: alternate. 

From the above we can combine 
certain elements into a fairly 
compact definition that seems 
to work fairly well for me: 
Science fiction is fiction that deals 
rationally with alternate possibilities. 

Modern fantasy would deal 
rationally with alternate impos- 
sibilities, incidentally. The simi- 



larity in handling and attack 
probably explains why many 
readers have also been devoted to 
the better fantasy magazines. If 
there is such a thing as “specula- 
tive” fiction it probably differs 
from science fiction only when it 
omits the concept of the alternate. 
Thus the matter of relevance would 
properly belong to speculative 
fiction when the relevance was 
keyed tightly to the realities of 
the present — in other respects 
science fiction is also relevant, 
since all fiction should be relevant 
to the human condition. 

This definition has nothing to do 
with value judgments. It says 
nothing about whether the result 
is good or bad — it simply 
determines for me whether the 
result is properly science fiction. 

AND for the moment I’m going 
XJL to suspend most of my own 
good-bad value judgments in re- 
viewing an anthology that ties 
directly into the foregoing. The 
volume is titled Clarion , edited 
by Robin Scott Wilson (Signet, 
95 i ). It calls itself “an anthology of 
speculative fiction and criticism 
from the Clarion Writers’ 
Workshop,” and it might be 
free of the requirements of science 
fiction, but. 

The cover labels it “A Signet 
Science Fiction” (sic). The copy 



136 



IF 




on the back cover mentions science 
fiction six times prominently and 
gives no mention at all to specula- 
tive fiction. And inside the front 
cover the puff quotes Damon 
Knight as saying, “This volume 
contains the work of 16 new 
science-fiction writers. 

I think it fair to decide that the 
volume is being marketed as 
science fiction and that it was 
edited to be sold as such. 

Mostly it just plain ain’t. 

Oh, there are several rather in- 
teresting articles on science 
fiction by some of the professional 
writers featured on the cover — 
Joanna Russ, for one, discusses the 
place of science fiction and is in 
excellent form. Some of the 
professional articles, on the other 
hand, are little but puffs for 
Clarion. And if you expect to find 
much science fiction by those new 
writers, forget it. 

There are twenty-one items in- 
side, since some of the writers 
contributed more than one 
piece of work. Of these, three 
seem to be genuinely intended as 
science fiction by writers who 
know the field — and a few others 
have future dates or backgrounds 
that are intended to make them 
look like science fiction. There is' 
also a genuine and rather pleasant 
fantasy at the end and a few other 
stories display elements of fantasy. 



Altogether I estimated about 
10,000 words of science fiction 
and fantasy in the whole book and 
perhaps an equal amount of word- 
age of simulated sf and fantasy. 
At least 32,000 words have nothing 
to do with anything outside the 
usual efforts of young writers to 
write avant garde or mainstream 
stories. 

Anyone buying this book as 
science fiction is being robbed. 
But the unfortunate writers 
inside are being robbed even more. 
Apparently there is no effort at 
Clarion to teach the difference 
between science fiction and other 
branches of literature. That is 
hardly fair preparation for the 
type of writing that the market 
they hope to hit calls for. 

Surely some of the lecturers from 
among the brilliant cast of visiting 
professional writers knew that the 
manuscripts they saw were not 
related in any way to science 
fiction. Or was the obviously 
happy time they had at Clarion 
enough to blur all judgment? Robin 
Scott Wilson, who headed Clarion, 
is himself a respected writer of 
science fiction. He should know 
the difference. 

The writing in the book is often 
quite good of its kind. But it’s 
the standard moody, experimental 
(make that pseudo-experimental, 
if you want to evaluate it honestly), 



THE READING ROOM 



137 




exhibitionist sort that is common 
to college courses where the 
emphasis is placed on write rather 
than right. 

I’ve seen much better stories 
by Clarion students in the maga- 
zines, so I hope they will learn from 
the market what they didn't seem 
to get in the Workshop. After all, 
study of the magazines and of 
our classics is the best college for 
our writers. 

T HERE were no workshops 
when Ted White began plan- 
ning to write science fiction. He 
had to do it all on his own, as 
most writers have found it best to 
do. He discovered science fiction 
in his school library, as I remem- 
ber, and then found out about the 
magazines. His first writing was 
for the fan magazines, because 
science fiction was important to 
him. And after numerous battles 
in the pages of those journals he 
began to think he could write 
professional fiction. 

By now he has written quite a 
bit of it, some as adult fiction 
and some for the teen-age market, 
to pay back the debt of his own 
discovery — perhaps. 

1 can’t say that I’ve liked all he 
has written. In fact, I’ve disliked 
some of the fiction he considered 
his best. But when I’ve read one of 
his books, I’ve never been in the 



least doubt that I’ve been reading 
science fiction. He doesn’t need 
dates and rocket ships and all the 
mechanical trappings to prove it’s 
science fiction, because he has the 
whole field as his reading 
background. 

His Star Wolf (Lancer, 95 i) is 
a simple story, stripped to the bare 
bones of adventure fiction. For 
most of the book, the cast of 
characters includes one man and a 
wolf-dog. Page after page goes by 
without a word of conversation 
(which is supposed to be needed to 
maintain interest). During the 
major part of the book, there are 
no enemies to be fought, no great 
conflicts to be met and endured — 
nothing except an endless trip 
across a cruel desert. 

It’s damned good! 

In a way the book is a sequel to 
Phoenix Prime. It returns to the 
alternate world of Qar (pronounced 
Quahr by Ted, not with the Arabic 
stop I took the Q for). We find the 
hero of the first book has left a 
son to be brought up in squalor 
near the desert and to wonder at 
the legend of his father. 

That father came from the desert, 
accompanied by a strange wolf- 
dog, then disappeared in the raids 
and wars of Qar. Markstarn, the 
son, wants to trace his sire. But he 
does nothing until one day a wolf- 
dog comes to him. Then he leaves 



138 



IF 




his tribe and heads for the deadly 
desert with the wolf. 

A destination and a fate find 
him, eventually. Botfi are satis- 
factory and there are some excel- 
lent aliens and traces of vanished 
culture to pique the reader— yet 
more than half of the book is 
made up of nothing but the trek 
across the desert. 

It’s good because Ted has made 
it into two trips. One is the physical 
one. The other is the mental one 
inside Markstarn’s head. The 
conflict comes from the nature 



of the boy’s search for his father— 
he makes himself over into the 
image he seeks. 

The book’s merits are probably 
enhanced for me because I rather 
resented the death of the wolf-dog 
in the first book. In the sequel Ted 
has managed to give it all back to 
me and use it the way I hoped. 

It’s not great literature. As I 
said, it’s an adventure story. But 
it’s one of those rather rare adven- 
ture stories — and it’s nice to see 
what can be done by sticking hon- 
estly to an idea.

I WISH Edmund Cooper had 
stuck as honestly to his idea in 
The Overman Culture (Putnam, 
$5.95). He sets up a seemingly 
elaborate World where everything 
is disturbingly different and yet 
similar to the one we know — we 
have World War II and Queen 
Victoria and protective screens 
and robots. The story is told 
through the eyes of a small group 
of children who grow up under 
the care of odd parents to discover 
that the city they live in has no 
real exterior world and that most 
of what they are taught is a lie. 
In time they decide to upset their 
parents, to battle the robots and 
to seek their own destiny. 

That’s all promising enough. 
But the promise is never kept. 
The story collapses into a hoax — 
there was never any menace and a 
whole lot of the tension was 
totally needless. The reader is 
rather badly cheated. True, every- 
thing is explained and justified. But 
the letdown at the end makes all 
that went before seem rather silly. 

F INALLY a brief mention of 
books that are not science 
fiction at all, but should be 
considered. 

Ignition , by John D. Clark 
(Rutgers, $10.00), is science fact 
and gives the inside story of the 



development of our rocket fuels. 
Dr. Clark was very much on the 
inside and he tells the only clear 
story I’ve read of one of the high 
moments of scientific research. It’s 
as good a job of reporting on a dif- 
ficult field as I can remember and 
far funnier at times than most. He 
writes well; the events are fascinat- 
ing; he makes the difficult clear— 
and this is how we got our rockets 
out into space. Some knowledge 
of chemistry is needed, *but a good 
high-school course should be 
enough. I echo Isaac Asimov’s 
Foreword in advising you to read 
the book. 

Deryni Checkmate , by Katherine 
Kurtz (Ballantine, $1.25), is a 
superb historical adventure story 
of a fantasy world that relates 
somehow to our past. It is one of 
the best written and best conceived 
fantasy adventure novels I’ve 
seen for quite a while. The second 
of three novels, but worth reading 
now. 

And Lancer Books has issued 
H. Rider Haggard’s She and 
The Return of She in a single 
volume for $1.25. The first part 
is one of the great fantasy 
classics — the Return is just as 
good and much less known. I 
found myself enjoying it as much as 
I did three decades ago. 

It is definitely not science fiction 
by any definition, however! #

44 T NTERPLANETARYcallfor 

A Mr. Fisk Centers,” the cute 
operator said. 

Fisk almost dropped his sand- 
wich. “There must be some mis- 
take. I don’t know anybody 
offplanet.” 

The girl looked at him with 
polite annoyance, as though no- 
body should be startled by such 
an event. “Are you Mr. Fisk 
Centers?” 

“Yes, of course,” he said. 
“But—” 

Her face sifted out, smiling pro- 
fessionally. The screen bleeped, 
went blank and finally produced a 
man. He had handsome gray hair 
and wore the traditional Mars- 
resident uniform — a cross between 
a spacesuit and a tuxedo. He was 
seated behind a large plastifoam 
desk and a tremendous color map 
of classical Mars covered the wall 
beyond. 

“Welcome to Mars, Mr. Cen- 
ters,” the man said, putting on a 
contagious grin. “I am Bondman, 
of Mars, Limited.” Somehow he 
had managed to pronounce “Lim- 
ited” the way it looked on the map 
on the office wall behind him— 
“Ltd.” 

Fisk was fifty and had been 
around, but he had never been 
treated to an interplanetary call 
before. The reason was not only 
the expense, though he knew that 



was extraordinary. He simply- 
happened to be one of the several ^ 
billion who had never had occasion 
to deal offplanet. Probably Mars, 
Ltd. was economizing by using 
OVTS — Open Volume Telephone ' 
Service — but the call was still 
impressive. 

“Are you sure—” 

“Now, Mr. Centers, let’s not let 
modesty interfere with business,” 
Bondman said, frowning briefly. 
“You’re far too sensible a man for 
that. That’s why you’re one of the 
privileged few to be selected as 
eligible for this project.” 

“Project? I don’t—” 

The Marsman’s brow wrinkled 
elegantly. “Naturally it isn’t avail- 
able to the common run. Mars is 
too fine a planet to ruin by indis- 
criminate development, don’t you 
agree?” 

Fisk found himself nodding to 
the persuasive tdne before the 
meaning registered. “Development? 

I thought Mars was uninhabitable. 
Not enough water, air—” 

“Most astute, Mr. Centers,” 
Bondman said, bathing him with 
a glance of honest admiration. 
“Indeed there is not enough water 
or air. Not for every person who 
might want to settle. Selectivity is 
the key — the vital key — for what 
can be a very good life indeed. 
Mars, you see, has space — but what 
is space without air?”

IF 




“Right. There’s no good life in a 
spacesuit. I — ’’ 

“Of course not, Mr. Centers. The 
ignorant person believes that man 
must live on Mars in a cumbersome 
suit and so he has a low regard for 
Mars realty. How fortunate that 
you and 1 know better.” And before 
Fisk could protest Bondman con- 
tinued: “You and i know that the 
new static domes conserve air, 
water and heat, utilizing the green- 
house effect to make an otherwise 
barren land burst into splendor. 
Within that invisible protective 
hemisphere it is completely Earth- 
like. Not Earth as it is today, but as 
it was a century ago. Think of it, 
Mr. Centers — pure clean air, gen- 
tle sunshine, fresh running water. 
Horses and carriages — automo- 
biles, guns, hallucinogenic drugs 
and similar evils prohibited. A 
haven for retirement in absolute 
security and comfort.” 

S OMETHING was bothering 
Fisk, but the smooth sales 
patter distracted him and com- 
pelled his half-reluctant attention. 
He certainly was not going to 
Mars. “But they don’t have such 
domes on Mars. That technique 
was developed only a few months 
ago and is still in the testing 
stage.” 

“Brilliant, Mr. Centers,” Bond- 
man exclaimed sincerely. “You 



certainly keep abreast of the times. 
Of course there are no domes on 
Mars now, as you so astutely point 
out. Why, it will be years before 
they are set up — perhaps even as 
long as a decade. This is what 
makes it such a superlative invest- 
ment now— before the news gets 
out. Provided we restrict it to in- 
telligent men such as yourself. 
I’m sure—” 

“Investment? Now hold on,” 
Fisk protested. “I’m not in the 
market for investment. I’m com- 
fortably set up right now and — ” 

“I quite understand. Naturally 
you’re not interested in a mediocre 
investment, Mr. Centers,” Bond- 
man said, frowning at his own 
failure in not having made the 
point clear. 

“Do you think I would insult 
your intelligence by wasting your 
time? No, you have the discern- 
ment to identify the superior value 
when you encounter it, unlike the 
common — ” 

“What investment?” Fisk de- 
manded, annoyed by the too-heavy 
flattery. The intrigue of the inter- 
planetary call was wearing thin and 
the objection he couldn’t quite 
formulate still nagged — and he 
wanted to finish his sandwich 
before it got stale. 

The man leaned forward to 
whisper confidentially. “Mars- 
land,” he breathed, as though it

were the secret of the ages. His 
voice was so charged with excite- 
ment and rapture that Fisk had to 
struggle to maintain his emotional 
equilibrium. Could there be some- 
thing in it? 

After a pregnant pause Bond- 
man resumed. “I see you under- 
stand. I was sure you would. You 
comprehend the phenomenal po- 
tential in Marsland realty, the 
incredible opportunity — ” 

“I don’t comprehend it,” Fisk 
snapped, gesturing with his ne- 
glected sandwich. “I have no use 
for land on Mars and 1 would con- 
sider it an extremely risky invest- 
ment. That dome technique is still 
in the prototype stage — it may not 
even work on Mars. So if that’s 
what you’re — ” 

“Yes, of course you want to see 
the brochure,” the salesman agreed 
irrelevantly. “And you shall have 
it, Mr. Centers. I will put it in the 
slot for you immediately, first 
class. I’m sure you will examine 
it most — ” 

Suddenly, facilitated by some 
devious mental process, Fisk’s 
nagging question came into focus. 

“You aren’t on Mars,” he said 
angrily. “Its orbit is fifty million 
miles outside Earth’s. Even when 
Mars is closest it should take a 
good ten minutes to get an answer 
by phone.” 

“Congratulations!” Bondman 



cried jubilantly. “You have just' 
qualified for our exclusive genius-' 
intellect bonus certificate. Of 
course I’m not calling from that 
Mars you see in the sky — I’m here 
at the Mars, Limited promotion 
office. Mr. Centers, I’m so glad 
you were sharp enough to solve our 
little riddle within the time limit. 
You’re the very kind of investor 
we prefer. I’ll insert the certificate 
right now. And I’ll be seeing you 
again soon. Bye-bye.” 

And while Fisk was marveling at 
the peculiarly childish “bye-bye” 
the image' faded. 

H E LIFTED his sandwich, a 
fine torula-steak on soyrye 
with enriched onion sauce, but 
found he was no longer hungry. 
He was sure this was a sales gim- 
mick for something worthless, but 
Bondman’s contagious excitement 
had gotten to him. Maybe there 
was a good investment on Mars. 

Well, no harm in looking at the 
literature. He certainly didn’t have 
to buy. 

He didn’t have long to wait, 
either. His mail receiver was al- 
ready chiming with an arrival. 

He picked up the bulky printing 
and spread it out. It was a first- 
class presentation, all right, with 
color photographs and glossy sur- 
facing that must have cost dearly 
to transmit. If he had not been 



146 



IF 




present when it arrived he would 
have suspected a physical delivery 
rather than the normal mailfax. 
Mars, Ltd. must have oiled the 
right palms in the post office. 

Well, he had to admit it— he was 
intrigued. He probably would not 
buy, but he would enjoy looking. 

First there was the bonus certif- 
icate, entitling him to a twenty 
percent reduction. Fair enough — 
but hardly sufficient to induce him 
to buy without his knowing the 
actual price. Then a spread on 
Mars — its discovery in prehistoric 
times, its variable distance from 
Earth (35-235 million miles), its 
long year (687 days — Earth days or 
Mars days, he wondered — or were 
they the same?), low surface grav- 
ity (one-third Earth’s), pretty 
moons (ten-mile diameter Phobos, 
six-mile Deimos), scenic craters— 
all familiar material, but calculated 
to whet the appetite for investment 
and retirement. 

Then down to paydirt. The pro- 
posed colony, Elysium Acres, was 
located on a map dramatically 
colored and named. An electro- 
static dome a hundred miles in 
diameter, almost fifty miles high, 
enclosed a greenhouse atmosphere 
at Earth-normal pressure and 
temperature. The development 
was suitable for homesites, with 
carefully laid out horse trails and 
a delightful crater lake. Guaranteed 



weather, pollution-free atmosphere. 

Fisk was middle-aged and cyni- 
cal, but this gripped him. Earth 
was such a sweatbox now. He 
hated having to take weekly shots 
to protect his system against en- 
vironmental contamination, and 
the constantly increasing restric- 
tions invoked in the name of the 
growing pressure on worldly re- 
sources made him rage at times 
like a prisoned tiger. (What other 
kind of tiger was there today?) 
Perhaps if he had married, found 
someone to share his— but that was 
another entire dimension of frus- 
tration, hardly relevant now. 

This Marsdome pitch catered to 
these very frustrations, he realized. 
There must be millions like him- 
self, men well enough to do, in- 
telligent arid sick of their own lack 
of purpose. What a beacon it was, 
an escape to an unspoiled planet— 
in comfort. 

But of course he was old enough 
to control his foolish fancies. He 
knew, intellectually, that no such 
development existed on Mars and 
probably never would exist. The 
sheer expense would be prohibitive. 
All that technology, all that ship- 
ment from Earth— why, passenger 
fare for one person one way would 
amount to twenty or thirty thou- 
sand dollars, assuming emigration 
could even be arranged. And for 
him it was out of the question. 



HARD SELL 



147 




Yet he could not help studying 
the brochure. Elysium Acres— 
such a suggestion of bliss! Could 
it possibly come true by the time 
he turned sixty? Why not, if they 
were able to finance it? 

There was the real rub. Money. 
How much to establish the dome, 
stock it with good atmosphere, 
import vegetation, calculate and 
maintain a closed-system ecological 
balance, construct access highways, 
lakes, houses, service facilities? 
There would have to be hospitals, 
libraries, administrative buildings, 
emergency staffs — all the accouter- 
ments of civilization, in short. It 
would cost billions of dollars to 
maintain — perhaps trillions to 
construct. Naturally the brochure 
did not provide the price list. 

But if it were affordable and if it 
were possible for him to go — what 
a temptation! 

He punched his personal info 
number for his net worth, just 
checking. The totals flashed on the 
screen after he had provided his 
identification code — liquid assets 
just over fifty thousand dollars; 
investments at current quotations 
just under two hundred thousand; 
miscellaneous properties and op- 
tions sixty to eighty thousand, 
pending urgency of sale. Grand 
total — a generous three hundred 
thousand. 

Enough, with proper manage- 



ment, to tide him through the 
twenty-five years until his retire- 
ment annuities matured. He was 
hardly foof enough to jeopardize 
any of it by investing in pie- 
on-Mars. Still, it had been fun 
dreaming. 

T HE dream lingered next morn- 
ing, a welcome guest staying 
beyond courteous hours. Fisk 
showered in the sonic booth, de- 
pilitated and dressed. As he ar- 
ranged and set his graying locks 
he wondered irrelevantly whether 
he and the salesman, Bondman, 
used the same brand of hair tint. 
He studied his face in the mirror, 
picturing himself as a hard-sell 
agent, lifting his brow artfully to 
augment a pregnant pause. Yes, he 
did look the part — perhaps he 
would be good at it. 

But then, subjectively, he saw the 
signs of what he knew was there — 
the circulatory malady that bound 
him to Earth for life. His quarterly 
medication kept it under control — 
but a trip to Mars, with the neces- 
sary accelerations and drugstates, 
was out of the question. That was 
why Mars would never be more 
than a dream for Fisk Centers, no 
matter how alluring the sales pitch. 
He would always be a portly, sub- 
dued Earthman. 

So it was time to end it. He filed 
the Mars, Ltd. literature in the 



148 



IF 




recycle bin and watched it disinte- 
grate. Then he punched breakfast. 
He felt lonely. 

The phone lighted. “Yes?” he 
said automatically. 

“Interplanetary call for Mr. 
Fisk Centers,” the cute operator 
said. She had changed her hairdo, 
but she was the same one who had 
placed the call yesterday. 

“Come off it, girl,” he snapped, 
aware that there was nothing more 
useless than taking out a personal 
peeve on an impersonal employee. 
“It is not interplanetary.” 
Bondman of Mars phased into 
view. “Of course it is, Mr. Cen- 
ters,” he said genially. “The Mars, 
Limited office is legally Mars soil, 
you know. An enclave. We have to 
undergo quarantine before report- 
ing for work, ha-ha! I trust you 
have studied our brochure — ” 
“Yes. I’m not buying.” 

Bondman looked hurt. “But you 
haven’t even heard our price, Mr. 
Centers. I know a man as fair- 
minded as you — ” 

“I’ll never go to Mars.” 
“Remember, you get a special 
bonus price because of your intel- 
ligence and judgment. I’m sure 
you’ll recognize — ” 

“I have a circulatory disorder. 
Inoperable. Sorry.” 

Bondman laughed with a finely 
crafted lack of affectation. “You 
don’t have to go to Mars, Mr. 



Centers. We’re talking about 
investment.” 

“I told you I wasn’t looking 
for-” 

“You’ve studied the plans for 
Elysium Acres? The phenomenal 
hundred-mile dome, the luxurious 
facilities, the nineteenth-century 
atmosphere — literally— the scenic 
lots? Of cdurse you have. Mr. Cen- 
ters, you know values. What do 
you figure it will cost? I mean the 
entire setup on Mars, gross?” 

“A trillion dollars,” Fisk said, 
believing it. “Plus upkeep of bil- 
lions per year.” 

“Would you believe three tril- 
lion? But you’re remarkably close, 
Mr. Centers. You certainly under- 
stand investment. You merely 
underestimated the importance of 
this development to us— and to the 
world. We’re putting everything 
into it, Mr. Centers. Another de- 
veloper might do it for one trillion, 
but we put quality first. Three tril- 
lion — but we know we’ll make a 
profit in the end and of course we 
have to consider profit, Mr. Cen- 
ters. We’re businessmen, like you — 
and believe me, sir, there is a de- 
mand. In ten years Earth will be 
a veritable nightmare and Elysium 
Acres will be an incredible bargain 
at any price.” Bondman held up a 
hand to forestall Fisk’s possible 
objection. “I’m not forgetting that 
you can’t go, Mr. Centers. I’m

merely pointing out what an at- 
tractive investment this is going to 
be. Some will have the incalculable 
privilege of retiring to Elysium 
Acres — others will merely make a 
fortune from it. I—” here the voice 
dropped to its supercharged con- 
fidential tone— “hope to do both.” 
Bondman paused long enough for 
that affirmation of faith to pene- 
trate, but not long enough for Fisk 
to generate an interjection. “Now, 
we’re subdividing E.A. into lots of 
one hundred feet square, give or 
take a foot— enough for a comfort- 
able cottage and garden. Twenty 
million of them— yes, that’s cor- 
rect, Mr. Centers. That dome is a 
hundred miles across and there 
will be eight thousand square miles 
inside and two and a half thousand 
lots per mile— but I don’t need to 
do elementary mathematics for 
you, Mr. Centers. Twenty million 
lots for three trillion dollars. That 
comes to a hundred and fifty thou- 
sand dollars per lot. A bit high 
for Earth, considering they’re un- 
developed — but this is Mars! Those 
lots are priceless, Mr. Centers, 
priceless — yet they will be put on 
the market at a price any successful 
man can afford.” He held up his 
hand again, though Fisk had made 
no motion to interrupt. “But Mars, 
Limited needs operating capital, 
Mr. Centers, and we need it now. 
So we are offering for a limited 



time only a very, very special in- 
vestment opportunity. You can 
buy these lots as investment real 
estate today for a tiny fraction of 
their actual value. Later— any 
time you wish — you may sell for 
a handsome profit. So although 
you may never have the privilege 
of going to Mars yourself— and 
please accept my heartfelt condo- 
lences, Mr. Centers, for I know 
how much you would have liked 
to retire to Elysium Acres — you 
can still benefit materially while 
advancing a noble cause through 
your investment.” 

F ISK was more impressed by the 
emotive delivery than by the 
content. Salesmanship really was 
an art. 

“How much?” 

“Mr. Centers, we are offering 
these lots at — now listen carefully 
because this is hard to believe — at 
one-quarter price. Thir-ty sev-en 
thou-sand five hun-dred dollars for 
a property worth one hun-dred and 
fif-ty thou-sand dollars.” Bond- 
man spaced out the syllables to 
make the figures absolutely clear 
and emphatic. 

“That’s my bonus for nab- 
bing your ‘interplanetary call’ 
gimmick?” 

Bondman rolled his eyes expres- 
sively but did not take exception 
to Fisk’s choice of words. “Of 



150 



IF 




course not, Mr. Centers. That’s 
our one-time special-offer bargain 
price. For you alone we provide the 
bonus price. “Don’t tell anyone 
else, because if word got out that 
anyone beat the bargain price there 
would be resentment. Even—” and 
a great rippling shrug bespoke con- 
sequences so vast that to invoke 
them by name would be foolhardy. 

Bondman did not speak that 
mind-shattering figure. Instead he 
fed it into his mailfax. The full 
contract emerged from Fisk’s slot. 
He paged through it while Bond- 
man waited expectantly, antici- 
pating the client’s amazed pleasure. 

Thirty thousand dollars. In other 
words, the straight twenty per- 
cent reduction the certificate had 
promised. 

Yes, it did seem like a good buy. 
Still, Fisk had had some experience 
in such matters. He skimmed 
through until he found the small 
print — actually regular type buried 
in an otherwise innocuous 
paragraph. 

Ownership remained with Mars, 
Ltd. until the stipulated amount 
had been paid in full. In the event 
of default, the property reverted 
to Mars, Ltd. without refund. The 
risk of capital was all with the 
purchaser, unless he bought out- 
right for cash. Very interesting. 

“Now you see the bargain we 
are offering you, Mr. Centers,” 



Bondman said gravely. “Frankly, 
you are one of the very last to 
receive the thirty-seven fifty figure, 
let alone the bonus deal. Demand 
has been even greater than we 
anticipated, with many people 
buying multiple lots. Blocks of 
four— or even more. There will 
have to be a price increase. After 
all, the company needs capital — it 
is ridiculous for us to sell so low 
when our own clients are turning 
around and selling their lots for 
more. Why only last week a man 
sold five for two hundred thousand 
flat — and he’d only bought them 
last month. He made a twelve 
thousand profit on a three-week 
investment— and that’s only the 
one we know about. Others — ” 
here his shoulders rose in another 
eloquent shrug. “Where, Mr. Cen- 
ters, is the limit?” 

“Why didn’t the second buyer 
come to you first?” Fisk inquired. 
Actually the described profit was 
only about six percent and normal 
fluctuation of the market could 
readily account for it. But it did 
seem to auger well for the growth 
prospects. Fisk could buy five lots 
for $150,000, not $187,500, and 
make that much more. 

“Apparently he didn’t realize 
our price was as low as it was,” 
Bondman said sadly. “He thought 
he had information. The biggest 
sucker is the one who thinks he 



HARD SELL 



151 




knows it all — right, Mr. Centers? 
If he had only checked with us — but 
of course our price wont be lower 
after this week. So he has a good 
investment anyway — though not 
as good as it could have been. If 
our lots are going for forty thou- 
sand — well, we do need capital,” 
he finished almost apologetically. 
“You understand.” 

Yes. Fisk was certainly interested 
now. Buy for thirty, sell for forty — 
but he knew better than to appear 
eager. “I might take a lot or two,” 
he said. “But it’s a lot of money. 
I’d have to liquidate some other 
investments and that would take 
time.” 

“I understand perfectly,” Bond- 
man agreed instantly. “I had to do 
the same when I invested in my 
own first Mars lot. It was well 
worth it, of course. Fortunately 
we have a time payment plan 
exactly suited to your situation. 
Ten-year term, so that it will be 
paid up when Elysium Acres opens 
and the real gold rush begins. Ir- 
revocable six percent interest. Just 
three hundred and twenty-five 
dollars a month covers all, Mr. 
Centers — we absorb the cover 
charge. How does that suit you?” 

F ISK checked the figures quickly 
in his head. They were fair — 
six percent on a decreasing princi- 
pal. No funny business there, no 



usury. And he would be able to 
liquidate his investments profitably 
within a year and pay off the rest, 
saving the interest. Some contracts 
had penalty clauses for early pay- 
ment, but this one fortunately did 
not. 

' “Sounds good,” he admitted. 

“Good? Good?” Bondman de- 
manded rhetorically. “Mr. Centers, 
how would you like to buy a cyclo- 
tron at the sheet metal price? That’s 
how good it is! But that isn’t 
all. What we are talking about 
is three-twenty-five a month — less 
than eleven dollars a day to control 
a genuine Marsland property now 
selling for — ” He broke off, nod- 
ding significantly toward the con- 
tract with the secret figure. “And 
with values quadrupling — or more 
— in the period of agreement. Mr. 
Centers, you are actually investing 
a paltry three-twenty-five a month 
for a return of at least a hundred 
and fifty thousand in a mere 
decade.” 

Fisk knew. Thirty thousand dol- 
lars, plus nine thousand dollars 
accumulated interest for the ten- 
year span. For $150,000 value. A 
net profit of $111,000, or over 
eleven thousand per year — per lot. 
With just three lots he could triple 
his fortune. 

“Still, it’s a sizable amount. Are 
you sure it’s safe? I mean, suppose 
something happens and the dome 



152 



IF 




doesn't get built. The lots would 
become almost worthless.” 

“Mr. Centers, it certainly is a 
pleasure to do business with you,” 
Bondman exclaimed. “You don’t 
miss a trick. Of course there is a 
nominal element of risk. Life itself 
is the biggest risk of all. But by 
buying on time you can eliminate 
even that one-in-a-thousand chance. 
Just consider. If something should 
happen to abort Elysium Acres 
tomorrow — and 1 assure nothing 
short of World War Four could 
squelch our plans — and you had 
bought today and paid your deposit 
premium, what would you have 
lost? Three hundred and twenty- 
five dollars. Why, Mr. Centers — 
you must blow more than that on 
one good suit.” 

Extremely sharp observation. 
Fisk had paid more than that for 
his dress suit. 

Bondman followed up his ad- 
vantage, knowing he had scored. 
“Considering the hundred and fifty 
thousand value — just what are 
you risking? One suit.” 

“But suppose something happens 
in two years. Or nine. I can’t afford 
to lose a suit every month.” 

“Mr. Centers,” Bondman said 
sternly. “I’m a busy man and this 
call is expensive. Don’t waste my 
time and yours with inconsequen- 
tials. If you don’t trust the stability 
of a fine new developer like Mars, 



Limited, don’t invest. Or if you 
believe it will fail in two years, sell 
in one year. Your property will 
have increased in value at least ten 
percent — in fact, considering the 
coming price rise, twenty percent 
may be a more accurate estimate. 
But just keep it simple, let’s call it 
ten percent. That’s between three 
and four thousand dollars, right? 
And how much are you paying per 
year?” 

“Between three and four thou- 
sand dollars,” Fisk said. 

“So if you sell then, your return 
on your actual investment will be 
just about one hundred percent. 
This is leverage, Mr. Centers — 
using a small amount of money to 
control a large amount of money. 
And the profit is yours even if, 
as you say, Mars Limited fails in 
two years. Or nine. Ha-ha.” He 
leaned forward again, speaking 
intensely. “The dome may fail, 
Mr. Centers — but you won’t.” 

Fisk laughed. “Very^ well, Mr. 
Bondman. You’ve sold me. Just 
give me a little time to check 
around—” This was a key ploy. 
If the salesman were out to take 
him he would do anything to pre- 
vent a fair investigation of the 
facts. And of course Fisk wouldn’t 
buy without checking. That was 
the big advantage in being an ex- 
perienced fifty. He couldn’t be 
stampeded. 



HARD SELL 



153 




“Certainly, Mr. Centers. In 
fact I insist on it. If we were looking 
for foolish investors we never would 
have called you. I’ll be happy to 
provide the government property 
report—’’ ■ 

“Thanks, no. I just want a few 
days to make some calls.” He was 
hardly going to use Mars, Ltd. data 
to check out Mars, Ltd. 

“By all means. I wouldn’t have it 
otherwise.” Bondman paused as 
though remembering something. 
“Of course, I can’t guarantee your 
price, Mr. Centers. That increase 
is going to come through any day 
now — perhaps tomorrow. They 
never let us salesmen know in ad- 
vance, of course, because some 
might — uh — profiteer at the ex- 
pense of the customer. But I know 
it’s soon. Your bonus will still 
apply, naturally, but five or six 
thousand per lot is a pretty hefty 
penalty for a day’s time. Uh — do 
you think you could make it by 
this afternoon? Say, four o’clock? 
I don’t want to rush you — and of 
course it might be as late as next 
week before the rise — but I would 
feel terrible if—” 

Bondman would feel terrible if 
he lost his commmission because 
an irate customer balked at the 
higher price, Fisk thought. “I 
think I can make it by four.” That 
would give him six hours — time 
enough. 



“Excellent. I’ll see you then. 
Bye-bye.” And the screen faded. 

F ISK had not been bluffing. The 
Marslot investment seemed 
attractive indeed, but he never 
made snap decisions about money. 
It wasn’t just a matter of checking 
— he wanted to appraise his own 
motives and inclinations. The best 
buy in the world — or Mars— was 
pointless if it failed to relate to his 
basic preferences and needs. 

He punched an early lunch and 
ate it slowly. Then he began his 
calls. 

First the library informational 
service for a summary of Mars, 
Ltd. operations. While that was 
being processed for faxing to him 
he read the sample contract care- 
fully and completely. It was tight 
— he would not actually own the 
lot until it was completely paid 
for and he couldn’t sell it until he 
owned it. Leverage? Fla! 

But apart from that trap, it was 
straight. He could defang it by 
purchasing outright. Not to men- 
tion the interest he would save. 

The rundown on Mars, Ltd. 
arrived. He settled down to his 
real homework. 

Interesting — there was a cau- 
tionary note about that “Ltd.” 
“Limited” meant that the devel- 
oper’s liability was limited to its 
investments on Earthsoil — of which 



154 



IF 




it had none. Its only Earthly en^ 
clave was, as Bondman had 
claimed, legally Mars soil. A nice 
device for impressive “interplane- 
tary” calls to clients — but perhaps 
even nicer as a defense against 
lawsuit. An irate party might ob- 
tain a judgment for a million dol- 
lars— but unless he sued on Mars 
there was nothing for him to col- 
lect. What a beautiful foil against 
crackpots and opportunists. 

The company was legitimate. 
In fact it was the largest of its 
kind, having sold billions of dol- 
lars worth of Marsland to specu- 
lators in the past few years. The 
Elysium Acres project was listed, 
too. A note read: see govern- 
ment PROPERTY REPORT. Fisk 
sighed and punched for it— it had 
not been attached to the main 
commentary. He had a lot of dull 
reading to do. 

The phone lighted. The hour 
was already four. He had meant 
to make some other checks — well, 
they hardly mattered. He had veri- 
fied that Mars, Ltd. was no fly-by- 
night outfit. 

“Did you come to a decision, 
Mr. Centers?” Bondman inquired, 
sounding like an old friend. 

Fisk had decided — but a certain 
innate and cussed caution still 
restrained him. The deal seemed 
too good to be true and that was 
a suspicious sign. But aside from 



the “leverage” hoax he could find 
no fault in it. He decided not to 
query the salesman about the time 
payment trap — to do so would only 
bring a glib explanation and more 
superfluous compliments on his 
intelligence. Better to let Bondman 
think he was fooling the client. 

“I might be interested in more 
than one lot,” Fisk said. 

“Absolutely no problem, Mr. 
Centers.” Fisk was sure the sales- 
man’s warmth was genuine this 
time. “Simply enter the number of 
lots you are buying on the line on 
page three where it says ‘quantity,’ 
write your name on the line below, 
and make out a check to Mars, 
Limited for your first payment. 
That’s all there is to it, since I 
have already countersigned. Fax 
a copy back to us and — ” 

Fisk’s mail chime sounded. “Oh 
— the property report,” he said. 
“Do you mind if I just glance at 
it first? A formality, of course.” 

“Oh, I thought you’d already 
read that. Didn’t I send you one? 
By all means — ” 

A buzzer on Bondman’s desk 
interrupted him. “I’m in confer- 
ence,” he snapped into his other 
phone. “Can’t it wait?” Then his 
expression changed. “Oh, very 
well.” He turned to Fisk. “I beg 
your pardon— a priority call has 
just signaled on my other line and 
— well, it’s from my superior. Can’t 



HARD SELL

say no to him, ha-ha, even if it is 
bad form to interrupt a sales con- 
ference. If you don’t mind waiting 
a moment — ” 

“Not at all. I’ll read the property 
report.” 

“Excellent. I’ll wrap this up in 
a moment, I’m sure.” Bondman 
faded, to be replaced by a dramatic 
artist’s conception of Elysium 
Acres, buttressed by sweet music. 
The connection remained. This was 
merely Mars, Ltd.’s privacy shunt. 

T HERE was a snap as of a 
shifting connection and Bond- 
man’s voice was superimposed on 
the music. “. tell you I’m closing 
a sale for several lots. I can’t just 
pull the rug out— he’s signing the 
contract right now. .” A pause, 
as he listened to a response that 
Fisk couldn’t hear. Then: “To 
fifty thousand? As of this morning? 
Why didn’t you call me before? 

Fisk realized that Bondman’s 
privacy switch hadn’t locked prop- 
erly. It wouldn’t be ethical to listen 
and he did want to skim that prop- 
erty report. But the voice wrested 
his attention away from the printed 
material. 

“Look, boss — I just can’t do it. 
I quoted him the thirty-grand 
bonus. no, I can’t withdraw it. 
He’s sharp — and he’s got the con- 
tract! He’d make a good Mars, 
Limited exec . no, terms, I 



think . yes, if we could get him 
to default on the payments, so the 
reversion clause . hate to bilk 
him like that— I like him ... no, 
I’m sure he wouldn’t go for the 
new price. Not with the cancella- 
tion of the bonus and all. That’s a 
twenty-grand jump just when he’s 
about to sign . okay, okay, I’ll 
try it — but listen, boss, you torpedo 
me in midsale again like this and 
I’m signing with Venus, Limited 
before you finish the call. I 
know they’re a gyp outfit. But I 
promised this client the bonus 
price and now you’re making a liar 
out of me and cheating him out 
of the finest investment of the cen- 
tury on a time-payment technical- 
ity. If I have to operate that way I 
might as well go whole Venus 
hog-” 

There was a long pause. Fisk 
smiled, thinking of the tongue- 
lashing Bondman must be getting 
for putting integrity ahead of 
business. 

Fisk knew it was unfair for him 
to take advantage of a slipped 
switch and private information — 
but he had been promised the 
bonus price and now someone 
was trying to wipe it out. If Mars, 
Ltd. were trying to con him out of 
his investment, he had a right to 
con himself back in. 

“. all right.” Bondman’s voice 
came again. “That’s best. I’ll try to 



156 



IF 




talk him out of it so nobody loses. 
But get those new quotations in the 
slot right away. Couple of other 
clients I have to call— they’re going 
to be furious about that increase, 
but at least they were warned about 
delaying . yes . yes . okay. 
Sorry I blew up. Bye-bye.” 

The music faded. The picture 
vanished and Bondman reappeared, 
looking unsettled. “Sorry to keep 
you waiting so long, Mr. Centers,” 
he said. “Bad news. The offer I 
was describing to you — well, I’m 
afraid we’ll have to call it off.” 

“But 1 just signed the contract,”' 
Fisk protested innocently. “Are 
you telling me to tear it up 
already?” 

Bondman’s eyelids hardly flick- 
ered. “What I meant, to say is that 
the conditions have changed. New 
government restrictions have forced 
up construction costs and the whole 
Elysium Acres project is in jeop- 
ardy. In fact, Mr. Centers, we now 
have no guarantee that there will 
even be a dome on Mars. Under 
the circumstances I don’t see how 
I can recommend — ” 

So that was the pitch. “We all 
have to take chances, as you 
pointed out,” Fisk said briefly. “I 
should think that if your expenses 
go up your prices would follow — 
to compensate. So I should buy 
now.” 

“Er — yes,” Bondman admitted. 



“Still, it looks bad. I wouldn’t 
want you to be left holding title to 
a worthless lot, Mr. Centers. Until 
this thing settles down—” 

“One lot?” Fisk interjected with 
mock dismay. “Lots. 1 signed up 
for ten.” 

For a moment even the super- 
salesman was at a loss for words. 
“T-ten?” 

“Why not, for such a good in- 
vestment? Leverage, you know.” 
“Leverage! Let me tell you some- 
thing — ” Bondman caught himself. 
He sighed. He put on a smile of 
rueful admiration. “You certainly 
know your business, Mr. Centers. 
I only hope you aren’t taking a 
terrible chance with a great deal 
of money. Are you sure?” But, 
observing Fisk’s expression, he 
capitulated. “Well, then, just make 
out your first monthly payment 
for three thousand two hundred 
and fifty dollars and we’ll — ” 
“Thanks, no. I’m paying cash.” 
Bondman looked so woebegone 
that Fisk felt sorry for him, though 
he knew the salesman would still 
receive a handsome commission 
along with his reprimand for letting 
so many underpriced lots go. 
“Cash? The entire amount?” 

“Yes. Here is my check for three 
hundred thousand dollars, certified 
against the escrow liquidation of 
my total holdings. That saves you 
the annoyance of time payments 



HARD SELL 



157 




and gives you a good chunk of the 
working capital you need. Your 
boss should be well pleased, con- 
sidering your rising expenses.” 

“Uh, yes,” Bondman' agreed 
faintly as Fisk faxed check and 
contract back to him. The originals 
remained with him for his records, 
but the faxes were legal, too. The 
deal was closed. He owned the lots 
outright and could not lose them by 
payments default. If he needed 
working capital himself, he could 
sell one at the fifty-thousand-dollar 
price tomorrow. 

Bondman stared bleakly at the 
documents, then pulled himself 
together. “It has been a real plea- 
sure doing business with you, Mr. 
Centers,” he said with a brave 
smile. “I’m sure you’ll never regret 
your purchase. Uh, bye-bye.” 
“Bye-bye!” Fisk returned 
cheerily as the connection broke. 

B UT something about the sales- 
man’s expression just as the 
picture faded bothered him. It 
reminded him of what Bondman 
had said during the morning call: 
The biggest sucker is the one who 
thinks he knows it all. 

The library information on 
Mars, Ltd. was general and, of 
course, bland. Any negative re- 
marks would have made it vulner- 
able for a libel suit regardless of 



the truth. It had provided him with 
essentially the Mars, Ltd. publicity 
release, but added the cautionary 
note: see government property 

REPORT. 

Fisk had been about to look at 
that report when Bondman’s boss 
had interrupted and the privacy 
switch had coincidentally mal- 
functioned. Interesting timing. 

After the price-increase call 
Bondman had been nervous and 
stuttery, hardly a supersalesman. 
His facade had disintegrated — 
yet he had known the word was 
coming. And salesman of that cali- 
ber should have been able to cover 
better than that. Unless the whole 
thing had been an act to puff up 
the confidence of a sucker who 
thought he knew it all. 

Fisk’s hand shook as he lifted the 
property report, for now he knew 
what he would find. 

Plainly printed in red ink: 

This property is not adapt- 
able for terraforming purposes.

THE 

MEN 

AT 

KAPPA 

They needed sustenance, 
and so did the 
voracious alien forms 

WILLIAM LEE 



T HREE men were living in 
Kappa Dome and at the end 
of their first month together were 
getting along pretty well — this 
in spite of their considerable dif- 
ferences in character and the fact 
that each of them may have had 
something to hide. 

Harvey Callan was a small man, 
wiry and energetic, an extrovert 
and an easy conversationalist. 
Within an hour after they had 
selected their sleeping quarters and 
unpacked their gear — following 
their arrival at Kappa Dome — he 
had been telling them about 
himself, his travels and his fre- 
quent and casual love affairs. He 
had no wife, no relatives, no 



159 




attachments. Travel light , he had 
said. It's the only way to live. 
Don t get cluttered up with friends 
and possessions. Money , of 
course , is different. Every once 
in a while / collect a wad , but I 
can never keep it. 

Some of his talk about himself 
was undoubtedly true. 

Nils Lundgren appeared to be 
Callan’s opposite in most ways. 
He was big, slow moving and 
rarely talked, never about himself. 
His accent sounded Norwegian, 
but he neither confirmed nor 
denied this nationality. His 
speech was larded with limited 
profanities delivered without 
rancor. He bore more than his 
share of the work. 

David Mallory’s character 
seemed to lie somewhere between 
the other two. He was not talka- 
tive but was willing to answer 
Callan’s questions about himself. 
He had been married, he said, but 
it hadn’t worked out and had been 
ended by mutual consent. He had 
held a civil service job, something 
to do with cost accounting, but it 
had been neither interesting nor 
remunerative. Out of boredom he 
had applied for a year’s contract 
on Midor III and, to his consider- 
able surprise, had passed the 
physicals and been accepted. His 
story, too, may have been partly 
true. 



The three of them, then, had 
settled into a casual colleague 
relationship while maintaining 
certain reticences. And honoring 
these in each other. 

The company which, by right of 
discovery, would hold the mineral 
rights on Midor III for another 
twenty-odd years — and for which 
they all worked — was careful to 
keep its operations small. There 
were no useful minerals on the 
planet, only pebbles of crystalline 
alumina variously colored by 
impurities. Emeralds, rubies, 
topazes and sapphires were at best 
baubles and would lose most of 
their value if they became too 
plentiful. So there were ten domes 
only, scattered along the ridges 
that were easiest to harvest, and 
there were rarely more than 
forty men who lived and worked 
there. 

Then Harvey Callan died during 
the night and there were only two 
of them to work Kappa until such 
time as a replacement might ar- 
rive. Callan died in a way to give 
you nightmares. A slug got him. 

It was to be hoped that he never 
knew it. Those who spent time on 
Midor were in agreement that you 
lost consciousness instantly when 
a slug attached — or maybe when it 
just touched you. The agreement 
was wishful thinking, because how 
did anyone know? The victim never 



160 



IF 




moved or spoke or even screamed 
and in a few minutes after contact 
he was dead. 

The slugs could digest their way 
through almost anything, boots, 
clothing or human skin, plastics 
or metals. But a shot of moderate 
voltage current would kill them 
fast. So would a laser or flame gun. 
The instruction manual provided 
by the company discussed nettles 
and slugs and other unpleasant 
surprises Midor could spring on the 
newcomer, but the advice given 
was simple. Keep clear of them. 
Stay out of valleys. 

When Callan hadn’t shown up 
in the galley for breakfast Mallory 
went to look for him. He was 
sprawled across the bed in his 
room. A slug was attached to his 
naked chest, its head buried, feed- 
ing. Automatically, preferring not 
to think about it, Mallory did what 
had to be done. He went to his 
room for his laser gun. The beam 
dispatched the slug fast enough 
and burned a small crease in 
Callan, too, but Callan was beyond 
caring. He may have been alive at 
that moment. His eyes were open 
but without expression. 

C AREFUL to avoid contact 
with the slug, Mallory un- 
strapped the money belt from 
Callan’s waist and, wasting no 
seconds, examined its contents. 



There was money, which Mallory 
ignored. Two sheets of foolscap 
covered with minute, rather sloppy 
script he removed and pocketed. 
He tossed the belt onto a chair with 
the rest of Callan’s clothing and 
went to call Nils. 

Nils stood and stared down at 
Callan for a minute, then turned 
away. 

“You get breakfast,” he said. 
“I’ll clean up.” 

Mallory heated coffee and a can 
of hash and when Nils returned 
they ate without speaking. 

“Where is he?” Mallory asked 
finally. 

“Outside. That flat place off to 
the right.” 

“Wired up?” 

“/a, all ready.” 

Mallory sat and considered Nils’s 
impassive face. The features were 
finely drawn, cast in a mold of 
scholarship, but Nils’s speech 
was carefully untutored, his 
manner unfeeling. He seemed to 
care nothing about Callan’s death. 
But then , thought Mallory, I must 
give the same impression. Method- 
ically Nils cleared away the re- 
mains of their meal. 

“We search the dome first, 
maybe,” he said. “See how it got 
in.” 

While they had been eating, the 
shell of the dome had changed from 
black to cloudy gray, filtering in 



THE MEN AT KAPPA 



161 




as much daylight as would ever 
reach indoors. The day was only 
a little lighter outside under 
Midor’s constant mantle of clouds. 
With all the dome lights v on and 
with torches and guns in hand 
the men systematically explored 
the lounge, each sleeping compart- 
ment, the galley, the head and the 
sorting room. The base area of the 
dome had been blasted, leveled 
and fused. There could be no faults 
there. The plastic shell with its 
cobweb of wiring was fully 
charged. In any case, there were no 
breaks. The slight positive pres- 
sure maintained inside was holding 
steady. 

In the sorting room Nils stared 
thoughtfully at the three sacks 
they had brought in the day before. 
Mallory nodded. 

“That must have been it. You 
and I came in yesterday practically 
together and I put a charge on both 
our bags. Callan arrived later. 
He stopped for a minute in the 
galley, then came in here. He must 
have forgotten.” 

“Goddamn bad thing to forget,” 
Nils muttered. “We take care of 
him now, eh? Before they get to 
him.” 

Callan’s body was loosely wrap- 
ped in a tarpaulin, saturated with 
nitryl and circled with several turns 
of resistance wire. Nils picked up 
the connecting cable, glanced 



briefly at Mallory and closed the 
switch. The mortal remains of 
Harvey Callan erupted in white 
flame and a streamer of dark 
smoke went whipping down the 
wind. They stood for some minutes, 
each engrossed in his own thoughts, 
until the pyre had diminished to 
incandescent ash. When it was 
over they turned back to the dome. 

“You want to call Iota?” 
Mallory asked. 

Nils hesitated. “You do it.” 

M ALLORY sat at the , radio 
. and jiggled the call key. 
Iota was the dome closest to them 
and the only one they could reach. 
They were limited to line-of-sight 
transmission and Midor’s spiny 
topography provided very few 
clear channels even on the heights. 
It began to seem that everybody at 
Iota was out hunting gems, but at 
length Peter Amahandra answered. 
Mallory told him the story suc- 
cinctly, with Nils sitting close by in 
the lounge, listening. Peter said 
that he would pass the word along 
to Alpha, so that the next of kin 
could be notified, and Mallory told 
him there weren’t any. 

He signed off and said to Nils; 
“You heard me suggest that since 
Alpha had five men they might 
like to send us a replacement right 
away. Amahandra didn’t think 
so. 



162 



IF 




Nils shrugged. “You could bet on 
that. Want to go out — or sort 
first?” 

“Sort first,” Mallory decided. 
“We’ve got Callan’s bag to do. 
Might as well get it over with.” 

In the sorting room they sat on 
opposite sides of the table with 
the screening box between them. 
A kilo of gems went into the box 
and a quarter of them fell through 
into the waste bin. Under strong 
lights they picked through the 
rest. Most of the stones were 
roughly spherical, but some of 
them were flattened, distorted or 
badly flawed. These also went to 
waste. It was a long way to the 
trading worlds, freight was costly 
and any gems under about three 
carats could only depress the 
market. The sorting went on and 
on. 

At last Mallory stood and 
stretched. “We’re caught up. Let’s 
eat something and go.” 

It wasn’t raining outside and the 
roiling clouds that looked so close 
over their heads showed patches of 
lighter gray. Even the moisture- 
laden air was more breathable 
than usual. The weather was good 
for Midor. Wordlessly the two men 
went their accustomed separate 
ways, Mallory westward along 
the ridge, Nils taking a long 
diagonal down to a lower level. 
Presently Mallory paused and 



looked around, his mind not 
seriously on gem hunting. Nils’s 
diminished figure could still be 
seen, threading a zigzag path 
between points. It wasn’t often you 
could see as far as today. 

Except for the area that had 
been blasted around the dome, 
the points reared themselves in 
all directions. They were shaped 
like stalagmites but were larger- 
some immensely larger — than any 
limestone stalagmite could have 
grown. They were granite, hard 
black granite, left by millions of 
years of erosion of softer rocks. 
Usually, not always, there was 
room to move between them: a 
deposit of crumbled rock or silt 
that made a pathway where with 
caution you could set your feet. 
In these narrow gullies were the 
deposits where you found the 
gems, sometimes lying exposed, 
more often mixed with gravel. 
Here, too, you might find slugs, 
although, thank God, there 
weren’t many of them on the 
heights. In the valleys were lush 
growths of stinging nettles, their 
chief food. Up here there was 
nothing to tempt the beasts. 
Nevertheless they came slithering 
up through the crevices. 

It started to rain sometime after 
the men had left the dome, not 
heavily but enough to spoil the 
visibility. Mallory pivoted for a 



THE MEN AT KAPPA 



163 




habitual look around. There was 
too much local magnetism for a 
compass to be useful. It was 
wisest to extend the search pattern 
by only a little each day, memoriz- 
ing the look of the terrain as you 
went. He might not be doing this 
much longer, but still. 

I N SPITE of his preoccupation 
Mallory had a good day. He 
found one rich gully overlooked 
before, which, with the aid of the 
trenching shovel and rake, yielded 
half a sackful of sapphires and, 
close to the limit he had set himself 
for the day, another nearly as 
good. So he was back ahead of 
schedule. He shucked his outer- 
wear and boots and searched 
Callan’s room thoroughly, but with 
as little disturbance as possible. 
The money belt was lying as he had 
left it, across a chair. The money 
was still in it. It wasn’t much — 
even as the accumulation of half a 
lifetime to traveling light. 

He finished his search in ten 
minutes, mixed himself a drink 
and fed a tape into the viewer. But 
instead of watching he thought 
about Callan and Nils. 

It was a half-hour or more before 
Nils stomped in. Mallory switched 
off the screen and said in response 
to the other’s grunt that he would 
put together some dinner. 

He swung open the door to the 



galley and jumped back with a 
yell. The place seemed to be swarm- 
ing with slugs, all over the floor, 
the table, the oven. He shoved the 
door shut and put his shoulder 
against it, a meaningless reaction. 
The slugs couldn’t push doors 
open. 

“Is what?” Nils demanded. 

“What the hell do you think? 
Slugs. All over.” 

“Where from?” 

“Who cares? Let’s burn ’em 
first and find out later.’’ 

Nils could move fast on occasion. 
He got to the supply room and was 
back with the flamethrower while 
Mallory was trying to remember 
where it was stowed. Nils set the 
dial for broad flame. Mallory 
swung the door wide. The slugs 
were even on the back of the door, 
three or four of them. 

Living, they had ' an acrid, 
nauseating odor. Burned, they 
smelled indescribable. Still, there 
was no need for respirators. The 
men worked in turn, trying to 
hold their breaths. They left the 
galley a sooty mess — free, however, 
of living slugs— and retreated to 
the lounge. The noise of the air 
pump rose to a whine as the chemi- 
cal sniffer reported massive 
contamination. 

“You saw?” Mallory inquired 
grimly. 

“7a.” 



164 



IF 




“If they’d set out systematically 
to puncture every food can they 
couldn’t have done it better.” 

“How the hell did they pull down 
the shelves?” 

“Ate out the underpinnings, I 
figure.” Mallory made another 
foray to the galley and kicked 
around the litter on the floor. “We 
have enough food for a week or so 
— if we don’t mind eating the 
leavings from a bunch of slugs. 
Not for me. I’m going to call Iota 
and get them to send over a load. 
If they can’t spare it, one of the 
other domes can.” 

With the work day over, the 
radio responded promptly. 

“Who’s that, Barton? Listen, 
Jake, we’ve got a mean situation 
here. You know about Harvey, of 
course. Yes, we think he forgot to 
sterilize his sack. Sure, we took 
care of it, but only after one of 
them got him. Well, he went into 
the galley and must have put it 
down there for a minute and one of 
them got out and laid eggs all over 
the place. Sure as hell they 
hatched. I don’t know, fifty or a 
hundred maybe. We haven’t made 
a body count. What’s important is 
that we haven’t any food left. Oh, 
nuts. You know they can dissolve 
their way or chew their way, 
whatever they do, through a metal 
can in nothing flat. Take a look in 
your garbage pit. Yeah, we’ll 



find out as soon as the stink is gone, 
but so what? I’ll bet there won’t 
be twenty cans fit to use. The 
point is, you’re going to have to 
send over some food. Maybe 
some extra cyanide. We’re going 
to have to sterilize the whole dome. 
What?” 

He listened and at length said, 
“I’ll call you back.” 

“That does it,” he told Nils. 
“You’d better get ready for a long 
walk. All three aircars are at 
Alpha Dome and they’re all out 
of commission. Their current went 
off for a few minutes last night and 
by the time they got it fixed the 
little bastards had crawled over the 
repulsor plates and corroded them 
to the extent that they won’t lift. 
They’re grounded till the next 
ship arrives.” 

Nils stared at him expression- 
lessly and said nothing. 

“Thirty-four days,” Mallory 
added, “if it arrives on schedule.” 

A N HOUR later they had 
l completed a partial cleanup 
and a count of the cans and foil 
packs of food that could be eaten 
safely — all told, enough for a 
week. So the trek to Iota was 
unavoidable. 

Under any ordinary conditions 
thirty-three kilometers should 
have been no distance at all for 
the two men to cover but these 



THE MEN AT KAPPA 



165 




miles were figured as the crow 
would have flown, had there been 
any crows on Midor. On foot the 
course would be twisting and turn- 
ing between points and, for all 
except the first few kilometers, it 
would be territory the men had 
seen only once and then from the 
air. Iota and Kappa lay on the 
same ridge. It, however, angled 
sharply between the two domes. 
To follow the peak would have 
taken the men far out of their way 
and a straight line march, if one 
had been possible, would have cut 
across the lowland swamps. The 
compromise route, the only feasible 
one, would descend the slopes 
nearly to the valley’s edge, parallel 
it, then ascend again toward — if 
they were lucky — Iota Dome. At 
no point could they expect to see 
the dome until they were almost 
on it. They could expect to be as 
good as lost for two days, guided 
only by the general slope of the 
land. 

It would be useless to leave at 
night and impossible to fumigate 
with cyanide without leaving the 
dome. In consequence Mallory at 
least spent a jumpy night imagin- 
ing slugs. Nils appeared to have 
lapsed into apathy. He did put in 
some time poring over a virtually 
useless map. Then, an hour before 
dawn, he dressed for the trek, 
gathered his gear together and 



sat staring aimlessly at the floor. 

Mallory rechecked the items he 
proposed to take along. The total 
was not too different from what 
they would carry on a usual day. 
Regulation wearing apparel: 
coveralls integrated with boots 
and gloves, neck cloths, hard 
hats with lamps . attached — a few 
food packs stowed in pockets, 
enough for two or three days. If 
they weren’t at Iota by then it 
probably wouldn’t matter. No 
need to carry water on Midor. 
The rain tasted sour and metallic, 
but it was drinkable. Laser guns. 
Walkie-talkie, in the hope that it 
might pick up something when they 
got close enough to Iota. At the 
last minute Mallory returned to 
his room and collected a small 
handgun that fired anesthetic 
pellets. It fitted snugly into an 
inner pocket. He wondered what 
undeclared items Nils might be 
taking. 

He made a last call to Iota to say 
that they were about to leave. 
Amahandra wished them luck 
and promised to be on the lookout. 
Light and power switches were 
flicked off. The door closed behind 
them and they turned their backs 
on five million stellars worth of 
gems. 

Rain was falling heavily and the 
wind had picked up to eighty or 
ninety kilometers from yesterday’s

relative calm. Without wanting to 
do so, Mallory glanced at the 
patch of Slackened ash — all that 
remained of Callan. Most of it had 
washed away. Nils stepped past 
him and took the lead. For a 
while they would be traversing 
ground with which he was familiar. 
Mallory was glad to be following. 

By their watches it was morning, 
but the sky still seemed quite black 
and here, close to the heights, the 
points reared upward fifty to a 
hundred or more meters. Some 
light was reaching them, though, 
and it was easier to find a footing 
without the headlamps. The rain 
drumming on their helmets drew 
slanting silvery lines that looked 
more like metal rods than discrete 
drops. Washes of diffuse lightning 
flickered among the clouds and oc- 
casional rumbles of thunder were 
audible over the rain. 

At length it seemed to be getting 
lighter, not so much from the 
advancing day as from the shorter 
pointsr— not that they were shorter 
in fact, but the rubble between them 
was increasing in depth and the 
tracks were wider. They came 
xinder the lee of a shallow cliff and 
by unspoken agreement stopped 
for a breather. It had been evident 
for some time that Nils was beyond 
the area he knew. 

“Want me to go first?” Mallory 
shouted over the din. 



Nils didn't bother to answer and 
after a minute moved on. They 
scrambled along the top of a 
scree slope, rocks sliding and 
rolling under their feet. Once Nils 
fell and rolled a little distance. The 
tumble must have been bruising, 
but he got up and went on without 
a limp. 

Three or four kilometers a day 
was what they were used to walk- 
ing. By the time they had used up 
a half-day the calves of Mallory’s 
legs were beginning to knot. His 
boots had been drawn from general 
stock at Alpha and had never 
fitted well. Each change of angle 
was resisted by his muscles. He 
and Nils would have to find a 
place to stop before nightfall, 
likely less than halfway. Mallory 
wanted very much to call another 
brief halt, but he wanted still more 
not to reveal hi$ fatigue to the 
phlegmatic Nils. 

T HE figure ahead of him dis- 
appeared suddenly. “What 
the hell?” Mallory growled. They 
weren’t a dozen paces apart. He 
discovered Nils by tripping over 
him. Nils was apparently on 
hands and knees. “What the hell?” 
Mallory repeated. 

“Foot caught.” 

“Grab my hand.” 

Nils grabbed and heaved and 
failed to budge. Mallory unshipped

167 




the lamp from his helmet and 
surveyed the situation. Nils’s 
right leg was down in a crevice as 
far as the knee. Water streamed 
into the crevice but found a chan- 
nel below and drained away and 
Mallory could see the heavy boot 
jammed between rocks. The foot 
was twisted. 

“We’ll have to get your foot 
out first,” Mallory said. 

The boots were equipped with 
four quick-release buckles, but it 
was evident that Nils couldn’t 
reach them. Mallory lay down with 
the lamp in one hand and maneu- 
vered his arm into the hole. From 
this vantage he could see more 
and what he could see made his 
scalp crawl. Less than a hand’s 
breadth from Nils’s foot a giant 
slug was clinging to the rock. Its 
body was extended, interrupted in 
the act of rippling upward. The 
light had startled it into momentary 
immobility. It couldn’t be touched 
with a laser beam without burning 
Nils. The gloves that would have 
given Mallory a few seconds’ pro- 
tection were lying on the ground 
behind him. He controlled the 
impulse to snatch back his arm, 
instead moved his hand slowly and 
carefully to touch the lowest 
buckle. It yielded with a snap. The 
white, translucent body quivered 
and extended forward. The black, 
button eyes seemed to be staring 



straight at Mallory. Each buckle 
gave in turn. Mallory’s arm and 
Nils’s foot came out simulta- 
neously, and the empty boot slipped 
sideward. An instant later Mal- 
lory’s laser sliced the slug in two. 

Nils peered into the crevice, 
then turned to stare at Mallory, 
who was tugging on his gloves. 
“Be damned,” he said. “You 
might have been killed. Trying to 
save my life. What was the sense 
in that?” He kneeled and extricated 
the boot from the crevice. “You’re 
a damned fool, you know. Any- 
way, thanks.” 

“Sure,” said Mallory. “No 
sweat. This is as good a place as 
any. Let’s eat.” He stooped and 
picked up a nearly perfect spherical 
emerald of twenty-odd carats, 
grimaced and tossed it away. Some 
day it might be found again, to 
give momentary pleasure to an 
unknown gem hunter. 

Their backs propped against the 
nearest point, they unwrapped and 
ate a couple of cereal bars, then 
turned up their faces to wash them 
down with a drink of water. The 
rain was diminishing as they 
continued their descent with 
Mallory now in the lead and going 
slowly. Nils was limping and trying 
not to show it. 

Their progress became an inter- 
minable business of putting one 
foot in front of the other, of

pausing only occasionally to 
hazard a new guess at their 
direction. Mallory was startled to 
realize that the day was nearly 
over and it would be fully dark 
soon. He switched on his light 
and waited for Nils to catch up. 

“The points are nearly covered 
up. We must be right on the edge 
of the valley.” 

“Must be.” 

“We can get up on one of them. 
Some seem to have flat tops.” 
Mallory turned and moved away, 
scanning the nearer points, and 
presently found one that looked 
promising. He climbed it and 
looked around. To the right — and 
very close — the gray foliage of 
the nettles spread uninterruptedly 
farther than the eye could see in 
the rain-washed twilight. The hills 
beyond, where Iota Dome should 
be, were invisible, although a 
play of lightning suggested their 
height. 

The flat area where Mallory 
stood had room for one man only. 
Nils was waiting below, swinging 
his light back and forth along the 
ground. 

“No room for two,” he shouted 
down. “Go straight ahead about 
a hundred paces and turn right. 
Looks like a good one over there.” 
He remained standing and extended 
the aerial of the walkie-talkie, 
knowing there was no reasonable 



chance of his picking up anything 
but hopeful of some radio freak. 
He pushed reception up to 
maximum and swung the aerial in 
a ninety degree arc. Not a thing. 
He looked toward the rock where 
Nils should now be standing or 
sitting. He wasn’t there. The last 
light of the day was fading rapidly 
but there was enough for him to 
be sure. Mallory muttered an 
expletive and slid down off the 
point, aiming his light ahead. 

T HE rubble had become more 
silt-like as they approached 
the valley and he could see traces 
of footprints. They led at first 
toward the point Mallory had 
suggested, then turned sharply 
down the slope. In a minute he 
was standing at the edge of the 
nettles. Nils had gone on. The 
plants had been pushed apart, 
leaving an open V that was re- 
covering slowly. Nils must have 
been mad to try to go through 
here and Mallory felt like an idiot 
to be following. He followed 
nevertheless and found the going 
less difficult than he had expected. 
The nettles grew head high, many 
of them topped by blossoms on 
which slugs were feeding, but the 
stems were bare of spines and 
could be bent aside with gloved 
hands. Nils’s trail stayed clear. 



THE MEN AT KAPPA 



169 




In half a kilometer Mallory came 
upon a rocky knoll several meterk 
across, the blunted summit of a 
point on which no plants had 
grown. He stepped up on it for a 
look ahead. Nils was using his 
light not far away. Mallory 
shouted and plunged down to re- 
new the pursuit. 

His heel slipped. With a contor- 
tion he avoided falling, but his face 
came into glancing contact with a 
nettle. It was like being hit in the 
face by a blowtorch. He let out a 
bellow of pain and brought up his 
hand to his face, which was the 
worst thing he could have done, 
since it pushed innumerable barbs 
deeper into his skin. Then he 
stood, rigid and shaking, com- 
manding all the self-control he 
could to avoid dropping to the 
ground and rolling. With tears 
streaming from his closed eyes he 
about-faced, felt for the edge of 
the rock with his feet and 
scrambled up to momentary 
safety. There he collapsed in a hud- 
^dle. Despite the agony of his face 
r a thread of sane thought persisted. 
He knew that soon he would be in 
delirium. That was the second 
effect of the nettles. He knew 
that he couldn’t stand and walk, 
couldn’t see to find his way out of 
danger and couldn’t protect him- 
self from a slug. His only hope 
was that Nils might find him. 



His left hand still gripped the 
lamp and from between squeezed 
eyelids he could see it was burning. 
He began to wave it and with that 
lost his tenuous hold on sanity, 
ke cursed and whispered, shouted 
and sang in a voice that, at best, 
provided no excuse for singing. He 
thought he was running and his 
heels drummed on the rock. He 
thought he was being buried in 
glowing coals. 

Nils found him. He was quiet by 
then, moaning a little and giving 
an occasional twitch. First Nils 
cleaned the rock of two slugs 
that were drawing purposeful paths 
toward a source of heat. Then he 
squatted on his heels and looked at 
Mallory’s almost unrecognizable 
face. There wasn’t much that could 
be done, but he got out a first-aid 
pack and sprayed the blistered skin 
with a mixture of anesthetic and 
antibiotic. He tied Mallory’s 
hands to his belt with a length of 
bandage. Then he began an all- 
night vigil. 

T HE day, when it came at last, 
promised to be a good one, 
with rain only in squalls. Nils 
could catch glimpses of the dis- 
tant ridge. Mallory started to 
rock his head back and forth. 

“Can you hear me?” Nils asked. 
“No, you can’t get your hands 
to your face. Don’t try.” 



170 



IF 



Mallory’s eyelids flickered 
open. He made an abortive effort 
to sit up. “Need a shave,’’ he said. 
“Can you hear me?’’ 

“Yes, sure.’’ 

“Can you understand what 
I’m saying?’’ 

“Why not?’’ 

“Blink your right eye.” The eye 
quivered and closed. 

“Very well. Your face is a mess, 
the lower half of it, but your eyes 
are all right. How do you feel?” 
“Awful.” He spoke with dif- 
ficulty through cracked and swol- 
len lips. 

“Keep still. I’ll spray your face 
again. Any feeling in your 
fingers?” 

“Hands and feet feel dead.” 
“Yes. The numbness wears off 
gradually, they say. Until you 
feel up to walking I may as well 
tell you a story.” 

“Where’s your Norwegian 
accent?” Mallory asked. 

“Nils Lundgren was my mother’s 
father. It seemed as good a name to 
take as any. Not uncommon over 
there and I could do the accent 
pretty well. At any rate, it got me 
off Earth and I thought I was away 
clear until Callan told me you — 
told me who you were.” 

Mallory rolled his head and 
watched as Nils drew his laser and 
picked off a slug that was making 
progress toward them. His vision 



was somewhat blurred and he 
squinted to focus on the speaker’s 
face. 

“I don’t want to pretty the 
thing up. I knew, almost from the 
time I went to work for him, that 
Blain was an unscrupulous man and 
I later knew that staying with him 
was reprehensible, but I stayed, 
partly because he paid me very 
well indeed. I still tell myself that 
by the time I knew how thoroughly 
evil he was, I was too deeply in- 
volved to leave safely, but that’s 
making excuses. He came to trust 
me up to a point. I knew five 
languages well enough to carry on 
his business negotiations. Some 
were legitimate. The man couldn’t 
help being honest occasionally. 
Most of his operations made him 
money. But then came Asteroid 
four-oh-eight. Blain himself was 
played for a sucker. Shall I go on?” 

“It’s your story,” Mallory said, 
“if you want to tell it.” He flexed 
his gloved hands, trying to work 
some feeling into the fingers. 

“Yes, I think I’d like to tell 
somebody why I killed Blain. 
Soon, 1 suppose. I’ll be telling a 
lawyer in the hope that he’ll 
figure out some kind of defense. I 
have no urge to become a martyr. 

“It was pure luck, my getting to 
Midor,” Nils went on. “How I got 
out of New York and how I nego- 
tiated a contract I won’t tell you

because it involves somebody who 
helped me. It would have been fine 
to have gotten paid off here at the 
end of my year and to have gone 
to one of the trading planets. But 
then I learned that you were U.N. 
Police. I’m puzzled, by the way. 
Why United Nations? Did Blain 
wield so great an influence that 
his people could call on a world 
organization to avenge him?” 

“Go on with your story,” 
Mallory said. “We can come to 
your question later.” 

ii T7ERY well. After Callan 
V told me, I began to rack my 
brain for some way to get back to 
Alpha without you, to break my 
contract, to get on the next ship 
going anywhere. But I formed no 
plan, nothing that was acceptable. 
Then Callan died and the roof, 
figuratively, fell in on us. Last 
night, in pure panic, I set off 
through these damned nettles with 
the hope, the very faint hope of 
reaching Epsilon.. It would have 
been about eighty kilometers in 
a straight line. I probably 
wouldn’t have made it and I al- 
most didn’t care. You might still 
have come after me — or, if I could 
disable their radio for a while, you 
might assume that I’d died in the 
swamp and gone on home. You 
see how desperation robs a man of 
good sense. 



“When I came back last night < 
and found you the thought occurred 
to me — I admit it — that all I had 
to do was leave you here. You’d 
never have survived the night. 
But, damn you, you had saved my 
life at imminent peril to your 
own. You left me with the obliga- 
tion to get you to Iota.” 

“Let’s get back to Blain, 
Mallory prompted. 

“Yes, of course. I’m being a bit 
disorganized about this. To go on 
back-end foremost, these are the 
facts that will be evident to the 
court and will probably convict 
me. I was Blain’s secretary. I 
had keys to any door on the top 
floor of the building, including his 
private offices. I knew the combina- 
tion to his private safe. As I told 
you, he trusted me up to a point. 

“On that night he said that he 
would be entertaining at home. I 
went to his office. I opened the safe. 
Blain surprised me there and pulled 
a gun, an old-style pellet gun, but 
lethal. I jumped him and took the 
gun away. He wasn’t very strong. 
Then I shot him. It wasn’t an acci- 
dent as the result of the struggle. I 
have no such defense. He was lying 
on the floor and I shot him through 
the head — because he had to die.” 
“Very clear,” said Mallory dryly. 
“Yes. The door of his office 
was then standing open, and within 
seconds two men, men who were 




to have had an appointment with 
him, looked in at me. I was stand- 
ing over him with the gun still in 
my hand. So theft you are. There 
was a scuffle and I broke away, got 
out of the building and went into 
hiding. How I got here is, as I said, 
none of your business. 

“Asteroid Four-oh-eight. Blain’s 
foot slipped on that. He had 
been led to believe it was rich in 
transuranian elements. It was 
done subtly, but it was the age-old 
trick of salting. The man who 
perpetrated the fraud is believed 
to have committed suicide. That 
is not pertinent. In any case, when 
Four-oh-eight was in a favorable 
position Blain shipped heavy 
machinery there with supplies and 
a crew of sixty miners. It cost 
him in excess of a million stellars 
and there was nothing there to 
mine. Are you following me?” 

Mallory nodded. He could move 
his fingers now inside the gloves, 
but his feet still felt like blocks of 
wood. 

“So the operation was aban- 
doned at a heavy loss. Very well, 
I learned — never mind how — that 
the flight of the freighter that was 
to have taken additional supplies 
to the asteroid had been canceled. 
Blain had given the order im- 
mediately on learning he had been 
cheated. Furthermore, he was 
issuing no order for the departure 



of the larger ship that would be 
needed to bring home the mining 
crew. Do you understand? There 
was enough food, enough water, 
enough power to carry them for 
perhaps several weeks, but their 
oxygen supply could be reckoned 
in hours. About ninety-six hours 
as I calculated it. And Asteroid 
Four-oh-eight was getting steadily 
farther from Earth. But Blain 
couldn’t bring himself to throw 
good money after bad. He 
couldn’t spend another quarter of 
a million, less than that actually, 
to save sixty lives. I tried to argue 
with him in terms he would under- 
stand. I told him that he would 
certainly be caught at it. He told me 
that the records would show there 
was an ample stock of oxygen. 
The disaster, when it was learned 
about, would be attributed to a 
leak in the system. He wouldn’t 
have gotten away with it, of that 
I’m sure, but an investigation 
would have been too late. It 
wouldn’t have helped those miners 
if Blain wound up in an insane 
asylum or in jail.” 

“But you didn’t report to the 
authorities,” Mallory interrupted. 

“There wasn’t time for process 
of law. A ship had to be dispatched 
immediately, within hours, or 
there would be nobody to save. 
Let me finish. I went to his office, 
opened the safe and got out the

code he used for his personal com- 
munications. There was a teletype 
machine in the next room. I 
teletyped Houston in his name and 
ordered out a ship, highest 
priority. I waited for acknowledg- 
ment and verified the order using 
the correct symbols. There was no 
hitch. 1 went back to his office to 
close the safe. 1 planned to be in 
South America by the time he 
discovered he had sent a 'rescue 
mission. Well, you know the rest 
of it.” 

“There was nothing in the news 
about the rescue of the men.” 

“Of course not. It was simply 
the last step of an unsuccessful 
industrial operation. It was 
ordered by Blain just before I 
killed him.” 

“You can’t prove a damn thing, 
can you?” 

“Nothing. But I thought I’d 
like you to know. Do you think 
you can walk?” 

“Unstrap my hands.” 

“I will if you can remember not 
to touch your face.” 



W ITH Nils’s help Mallory 
made it to his feet and stood 
uncertainly. 

“Good. Now put your hands on 
my shoulders and try to keep 
step. I’ll go slowly and I’ll take 
care of nettles and slugs. Just 



keep your mind on walking. We’re 
going to get out of the valley the 
shortest way, the way we came in. 
Then we’ll skirt it. Ready?” 

There was a knack, Mallory 
discovered, to stumping along on 
feet that had no sensation. After 
a few stumbles they worked out 
a lockstep gait that made steady, 
slow progress. In a little while they 
were on higher ground. The pain 
in Mallory’s face was subsiding 
to the degree that his thought pro- 
cesses seemed to realign themselves 
from time to time. The decision 
that had to be made had in fact 
been reached earlier, but he shied 
away from recognizing it and 
making it irrevocable. 

They found a spot where, after 
Nils had scouted it for slugs, it 
seemed safe to sit and rest. Twice 
they halted to eat, a difficult 
business for Mallory. At midafter- 
noon they agreed to start the trek 
upward. 

Before they had gotten out of 
the area of low points Nils stopped 
abruptly and pointed to a spot 
where a circle of white light showed 
against the gray clouds. After a 
moment it could not be mistaken. 

“They’ve used their heads,” 
Nils said. “Rigged a search-light 
to play on the clouds. Can you 
hold up for another hour or so of 
walking?” 

“With a couple of breaks, yes. 



174 



IF 




My feet are getting some feeling in 
them.” He displayed the pellet 
gun. “When we get closer this 
will make a noise and may bring 
them to us. First, I’ve got some 
talking to do.” 

“Go ahead.” 

“Question. How well did you 
get to know Callan?” 

“Not well at all — in spite of all 
his talk.” 

“Right. It was mostly fabrica- 
tion. Callan was a professional 
thief, not a vefy important one. 
He held a long string of jobs and 
was reasonably competent at 
some of them, but they all ended 
the same way. He stole something, 
often trivial, and disappeared. On 
his last job he made a mistake. He 
stole something important.” 

Nils stared at him with an 
expression of shock. 

“Are you saying that his last 
jobs was with United Nations?” 

“Yes.” 

“And that he stole something 
from them?” 

“That is correct. He was a 
messenger, cleared to carry 
classified documents up to confi- 
dential. One day he was handed an 
envelope containing currency, 
about ten thousand stellars, and 
told to deliver it to another office. 
The theft of the money was an 
embarrassment, no worse. Un- 
fortunately, along with it was 



another envelope containing a 
long-hand draft of a resolution 
pertaining to relations between 
two of the nearer planets. The 
draft itself would have been no 
great loss, but the writer had added 
some marginal notes that would 
have been taken as offensive by one 
of the parties and could have 
seriously damaged the U.N. rep- 
utation. Callan didn’t know 
what he had, but he was thought 
to have kept it. He was an op- 
portunist. I was sent after him to 
recover or destroy it.” 

“And did you?” 

“Yes.” 

Nils stood silent for a time. Then 
he asked quietly and flatly, “Now 
what?” 

Mallory offered a silent farewell 
to principles that had guided him 
for two decades. “Now,” he said, 
“we get on into Iota. For myself, 
I’m going to be reporting that I 
can’t take much more of Midor. 
I’ll break my contract and head for 
home on the earliest ship. I 
suppose that you, Nils, will finish 
out your year.” 

“What I told you—” Nils began. 

“What you told me?” Mallory 
repeated. “You mean back there 
when I was out of my head? Seems 
to me you were telling me some 
long, involved story about some 
people I never heard of before. I 
couldn’t make head or tail of it. •

HUE AM CRY 

(Continued from page 63) 

Most Americans already invest in 
the future in some manner — and all 
have an investment in the growth and 
progress of human knowledge. 

Beneficial byproducts of the Space 
Program now nearing its end already 
have touched nearly all Americans. 

There’s ammunition. 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

Just finished reading If (February, 
1972) and I thought I would comment 
on a great issue. I particularly liked 
Patterns of Chaos, by Colin Kapp. 
Kapp is masterful with his prose— and 
with his imagination! 

Gail Habbyshaw 
Mercer, Pa. 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

I've been reading Colin Kapp's 
serial. Patterns of Chaos, and so far it 
has held my interest. One thing about 
the novel constantly disturbs me — the 
barrage of cliches in the characters' 
conversations. For instance, “ Jet off 
Jaycee — " or “ Spool it, Bron — " or 
" Get off my back — " etc. The infight- 
ing between Bron, Doc, Jaycee and An- 
anias also tends to seem phony, mainly 
because it is overdone and too lengthy. 
I'd like to see a little more subtlety in 
the clash of emotions. Kapp gets car- 
ried away in these sections and the 
characters seem oblivious to what is 
happening around them. Still, it's a 
good story and I hope you have more 
as enjoyable. 

I think Lester del Rey may have 
been expecting a bit too much from Ur- 
sula K. LeGuin's new novel. The Lathe 
of Heaven. From his review LeGuin’s 



novel would seem much worse than 
Simak's A Choice of Gods. I've read 
both and I hardly think the LeGuin is 
inferior to the Simak work. Both 
actually depend a great deal on the 
emotional povJer they build up, a sort 
of rolling, flowing tide that peaks and 
ebbs at the story's climax. For me there 
was as much nostalgia in LeGuin's 
novel as there was in Simak's. 

Your comments on fantasy and your 
reply to Henry Bitman's thoughts on 
the purpose of fiction (in the February 
Ifj were most just, I felt. But I am 
surprised that you never thought to 
connect them. Since, as you say, fiction 
simulates nothing but is valid within 
itself, then it doesn’t really matter 
whether the fiction is fantasy, sf, main- 
stream, mystery or whatever. All are 
equally valid — they create a vivid 
reality of their own, or should if the 
story is well written. And, of course, 
every story has an emotional relevance 
to the real world — which is what I think 
you were referring to regarding Arnten 
of Ultima Thule. 

You may print my address. 

Cy Chauvin 
1 7829 Peters 
Roseville, Mich. 48066 

You’re right on Arnten of Ultima 
Thule. The story also deals with the 
imagery of faiths and beliefs that have 
validity simply because people have

You can get tan. And you can get cancer. 



Maybe you think you look better tan. 

Tan looks healthy. 

But under that healthy glow you could be 
giving skin cancer a head start. 

So if you spend a lot of time in the sun, or 
if you work outdoors and you have a sore that doesn't 
seem to heal, see your doctor. Almost all skin 



cancers can be cured if diagnosed early. 

If you have fair skin, cover up. 

And if you've been lucky so far, plan on a little 
less sun this year. You’ll be better off for it 
in the long run. 

We want to wipe out cancer in your lifetime. 
Give to the American Cancer Society. 





The acceleration started with Hiroshima. 
Without warning, we switched to mechanized 
lives, disposable goods, impermanent alle- 
giances. We entered the plug-in, throw-away, 
rent-a-thing, forget-a-person age. We began 
using up products, ideas, people at a dizzying 
rate. 

Some people thrive on the pace. Others 
find it terrifying. Some simply refuse to recog- 
nize it, abruptly colliding with the future and 
suffering an adaptive breakdown. Alvin Tof- 
fler calls it “future shock.” 

What’s the preventative? Start with the 
Science Fiction Book Club. Science Fiction
