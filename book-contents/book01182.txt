Effective with the April issue, 
GALAXY’S subscription rates will 
go to $12.00 per year and its 
newsstand price will be increased 
to $1.00 per issue. 

This is a step we must take, re- 
luctantly, to meet dramatic new 
increases in paper costs and 
printing prices, as well as recent 
scheduled new increases in 
postage. 

For a very limited time, we are of- 
fering our readers and subscribers 
an opportunity to enter new sub- 
scriptions or extend existing sub- 
scriptions at the current selling 
price of $7.50 per year. By acting 
now, while the current low sub- 



scription rates are still in effect, 
you can save $4.50 per year over 
the new prices. And protect your- 
self against any possible future 
rate increases, throughout the life 
of your subscription. 

So don't miss out on this chance 
to beat the coming price rise. And 
if you send us your order now, you 
won’t miss out on the big things 
that are planned! Fantastic minds 
to be encountered. ..tripping out 
among the stars... extrapolations 
of present day situations, prob- 
lems, policies and cultural trends. 
All brewed in the fertile imagina- 
tions of the likes of Asimov,

IF THIS GOES ON (AND ON, AND ON ... ) 



Boy, ha^e we got problems. And if we don’t solve them some pretty 
terrible things are going to happen — and we all know it. 

That’s the point. Thanks in large part to the efforts of those involved in 
science fiction, the Big Problems of ecological contamination, over- 
population, dwindling resources, genetic and p>ersonal peril arising from 
drugs and food additives (well, there may still be a bit of room on that 
one) and so on have all become a part of public consciousness — and cer- 
tainly have been incorporated into the awareness of virtually every reader 
of science fiction. 

In other words, we have already done a more than adequate job of 
broadcasting the consequences of stepping in it. Maybe it’s time to ' 
dramatize ways and means of stepping around it — and the benefits accru- • 
ing therefrom. Maybe it’s time to begin the Next Phase — one which the 
world sorely needs — that of instilling an awareness in our rapidly despair- 
ing populace that while man and his planet may be in for Hard Times, 
these Hard Times are by no means inevitable, that, given the will, we have 
the means and the knowledge to do something about our problems. 

Example: Laser-generated fusion is a virtual certainty during this decade. 
This means that the 1980’s will see both cheap, “clean” energy and the 
first constant-acceleration space-vehicles (oh, what the hell — spaceships!) 
capable of ranging the Solar System at a payload cost of pennies-per-pound 
at point of delivery. 

Example: Cheap, simple, safe, reversable male sterilization is imminent. 
What will this do to world population trends? 

Example: A laser anti-ballistic-missile system could be begun today (and 
perhaps has been) that would neutralize for the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. the 
dangers of nuclear proliferation. (See this month’s science article.) 

So perhaps we should mute our cries of doom, and speak if not in tones 
of triumph, then at least of hope — and courage. For those of you who have < 
an unconquerable urge to create still another “fully realized world” 
steeped in misery and horror resulting from 20th Century stupidity — please 
try another market. I firmly believe the readers are as bored with it as is 
this editor.

Larry. I’ve been looking over 
your circulation figures for an up- 
coming report for Allison Jr. in 
the main office and I ran across 
something strange. Listen to this. 
Paid newsstand circulation for 
your book for cover-dates July and 
August ’72; May, July and De- 
cember ’73; and March ’74 was 
down almost 5000 copies each. 
Very regular decreases. I wouldn’t 
have even noticed them in the 
middle of all your other ups and 
downs if the drops weren’t so 
even. 

But I can’t explain them. Not 
even to myself, let alone someone 
like Allison who wants nothing 
more than to get you dropped 
from the group as it is. 

Maybe you have some ideas. 
It’s not in my end. I’ve checked it 
all the way down the line. Differ- 
ent months, different seasons, 
same distributors, same news- 
stands. 

Are you beginning to run porn or 
is one of our competitors sticking 
pins into his Quasar doll? What 
gives?

Rodge. (Remember the good old 
days before we were bought and 
you still worked with me when I 
could put your name on line-one 
instead of seven? Thanks for the 
warning old buddy. I could give 
you any number of reasons for our 
losing circ but I can’t think of 
anything that could account for 
such astounding disregularity. 
What could it be? Sunspots? 
Smog warnings? Blonde center- 
folds in Playboy? 

Anyway, I’ll put my new assis- 
tant on it. He’s a BBFU (Bright 
Boy From Upstairs), somebody’s 
relative probably. We re building 
up a fine mutual dislike because 
he’s going batty reading the slush 
pile and he’s taking it out on me. 
Hopefully something like this will 
send him out of here with foam 
coming from his mouth. I could 
use something like that to bright- 
en my day. Besides, even if 
worst came to worst and he fig- 
ures this out, we’re still ahead. I 
can’t lose.

memo, so you can take your nose 
out of the slush pile for a while. 
Dig up the six issues that went 
bad with as many others as you 
can find and figure out one of two 
things; 1) What the hell is similiar 
about those six or 2) How they 
are different from the rest. 
Analyze. Quantify. Draw maps

but I want it done in th ree 
days — in time for next issue’s

To: Rodger Frew

Rodge. We may, just may, have 
something. It sounds strange (ob- 
vious was the way my assistant 
put it) but there isn’t anything 
else as far as we could tell that’s 
common to those six issues and 
those six issues alone. 

Let me tell you a little story. 

Sometime back in 1970, not 
long after we were taken over by 
TE, Inc. in that massive acquisi- 
tions grab of theirs, I began to re- 
ceive stories through the slush 
pile from an author I had never 
heard of before. (I was still doing 
my own first-reading in those far 
off, bygone days.) Slush pile or 
no, these stories weren’t at all 
bad. In fact I bought the first one 
I saw and every one after that. 
Unusual. What’s more unusual is 
that he sells only to us. And posi- 
tively strange is the fact that I 
have no biographical detail on 
him at all. None. A hint that the 
name’s a pseudonym, a hint that 
he’s young, a hint that he knows 
computers. Checks go to a box 
number right here in New York. 

The stories came in regularly

IN THIS MONTH’S ISSUE 




and got better and better. Reader 
response was good. I thought I 
had a real find in him. I became 
convinced when, about a year or 
so after I first heard from him, I 
got an especially good novelette. 
Very nice. So I assigned a cover for 
it and ran it as the lead story in the 
issue. Naturally his name ran on the 
cover too. 

As an old hack, Rodge, you can ' 
guess what the hook is. That was 
the January 1972 ish. 

So. Another story, not as good. 

I run it in May but his name 
doesn’t go on the cover. In Au- 
gust, though, there it is again. 
When the circ hits bottom. And 
again the next May, and July, 
and, and. Not merely when he’s 
in the issue. Not when he writes 
a poor story. When he’s on the 
cover. 

I can’t tell you what the hell is 
going on. All I know is that I 
found out just in time to take his 
name off the cover for next time. 
The painting has been set up for 
printing, of course, but I can 
change the overlay with the 
names on it just enough so that 
his name disappears without af- 
fecting anything else. Especially 
the circulation. 

Now tell me. Just how fast can 
you tell me whether or not we get 
that ten percent drop? In the 
meantime I’m going to remove 
my BBFU temporarily from the 
banalities of his normal existance 
to see if that Harvard educated 



brain of his can come up with any 
other deductions. I’m beginning 
to feel kindly toward him now, 
stuck off in. this god-forsaken 
corner of the conglomerate. 
Maybe investigating this will 
make him feel useful and keep 
him out of my hair at the same 
time. 

Keep me posted, and for god’s 
sake not a word to Allison Jr.

Sir. The report on our three year

Must I remind you that no useful

problem ? 

If you find yourself incapable of

Just back from the Spring Sales Conference where we pre- 
sented our 1975 list. What a reaction! Never has there been a 
science-fiction program quite like this one. .bigger and bet- 
ter than ever! 

Look for our stunning new logo— Ballantine’s Seal of Selec- 
tion stamped on every sf book. Then there’s a spectacular new 
cover “look,” featuring design and illustration by top com- 
mercial artists — some of whom we are introducing to the field. 

• • • • • 

We will have larger print orders, bigger ad budgets, addi- 
tional titles published (three instead of two each month) and 
lots of reprints and reissues from our million-dollar backlist. 
In other words: the best of the old, the best of the new and 
the best of the best! 

And it all starts in February.

Circulation was not down 10%. 
In fact, it went up, if only 2.7%. 
Give your assistant a raise. BUT 
HAS HE COME UP WITH THE 
REASON YET? That’s what I 
would like to know. 

By the way. I’ve had to turn in 
the circulation report to Allison 
Jr., so he may be sending down 
some nasty memos. Give him the 
good news about not having these 
drops in the future, maybe it 
will slow him down for a while. 
P.S. I read some of the guy’s 
stories in the past couple of weeks 
and they aren’t bad. Lack a cer- 
tain life, though. Is there any way 
we can send him over to our 



competitors and put him on their 
covers? Or better yet, on a 
paperback antho or ten?

such a backlog of slush-pile stories 
here that I’ve had to start reading 
them myself to get things moving. 
And one of the conditions I in- 
sisted on when TE wanted to buy

you. I know you’re doing some-

some bearing on our problem. 

Now, if I don’t hear something 
from you by tomorrow, you’ll find 
yourself doing lay outs and paste

Boss. Don’t go getting yourself 
lost in fantasies of your past glory 
because — unlike you — I have rela- 
tives in high places. I’m not sure 
if I could get your-job taken away, 
but you’d find yourself answering 
more memos than I see Adam and 
Eve stories each day. Fortunately 
for you my opinion of Allison Jr. 
(my second cousin, as near as I 
can figure it) is lower than Wil- 
liam Buckley’s for Gore Vidal. 

But since I’m preparing to take 
over your somewhat more pre- 
stigious job I went to work to save 
the magazine when I smelled a 
Machievelli^ hand in our circula- 
tion figures. There’s a complete 
summary of the last few weeks at- 
tached to this, along with an exp- 
lanation of the time-sharing bills 
you’re going to get for the com- 
pany computer. I doubt if you’ll 
read it, much less understand it, 
so I’ll simplify it here. 

Six years ago, Allison Sr. (my 
first cousin, comprende?) added 
this magazine into his publishing 
empire as both a tax loss and a 
reason for asking Congress for 
special-interest postal legislation. 
Therefore we are supposed to lose 



IN THIS MONTH’S ISSUE

money. Somehow you’ve managed 
to stop doing so (and as soon as I 
can figure out how. I’m moving 
upstairs). Now, Allison Sr. likes 
this kind of initiative in the face of 
adversity but it drives Allison Jr. 
up the wall. Or at least that’s how 
family gossip has it. 

Allison Jr. drew up a plan. You 
had to be made to lose money but 
it had to be covert or else his 
old-line capitalist father would be 
up in arms. How to work it. 

I found out from one of the 
computer jocks in the main office 
who went to Harvard with me. 
(I’m billing the gram of hash it 
took to the company.) 

Allison Jr. went to the same 
computer that works out package 
names for our lines of board 
games and paperback action series 
to come with an anti-euphonious 
name guaranteed to drive the av- 
erage science reader screaming 
into the night. Remember the 
study he ordered of newsstand 
buyers of SF magazines? He’s 
been plotting this for a long time. 

One problem left. How to get 
this name on the cover of the 
magazine where the buying public 
could see it? Easy. 

All of our computer jocks, my 
cousin discovered, are SF read- 
ers. It was no trouble for him to 
get the whole computer crew in- 
terested in a secret project to 
program ideas into our Scientific 
Application Systems computer (a 
wholly owned subsidiery) and 



teach it to grind out better and 
better science fiction plots that 
could be ghosted-up into a com- 
plete stories by one of the com- 
panies pet hacks — good enough 
stories to get the “author’s” name 
on the cover in not too many is- 
sues. 

Nice to know that kind of talent 
is in my family.

plan you sent for improving dis-

you steal it off of? You never

Anyway, the early reports that 
I’m getting on Quasar say that 
sales are up. Positively healthy, in

Rodge. Sorry I took so long to get 
around to answering you but your 
memo got misfiled when I 
changed offices and it took this 
long to catch up to me. 

I’m sending this along with 
Marshall’s report. Remember 
Marshall, my BBFU? Read his 
thing first and then get back to 
this so I can tell you the rest of 
the story. 

All done? OK, now to let you 
in on the secret of our circulation 
increase, which must not be 
breathed to a living soul, es- 
pecially not even that 
secretary/mistress of yours. 

After Marshall filled me in on 
the sabotage the rest was easy. 
The computer jocks up in the bil- 
ling office were having a fine time 
playing with their creation until I 
sent Marshall upstairs to tell them 
the facts of life. 



It would seem that Allison Jr. 
had neglected to tell them that 
their little joke was being used to 
kill their favorite mag. 

God, the power of a computer 
scorned. For revenge they tossed 
a subtle bug or two in Allison Jr.’s 
brand new, heavily publicized 
subscription computer with re- 
sults that must have had you con- 
templating suicide the past few 
weeks. (It won’t happen to us, 
they assure me. As long as I be- 
have myself, that is.) 

With the time stolen from nam- 
ing our new line of packaged art 
masterpieces we re-ran the results 
of the newsstand survey and came 
up with a name for my new “dis- 
covery”. I like the stories, myself.

getting positively talented. As for

POLITICS 

of 

RAniCIDE 




ARSEN DARN AY 

Pity poor Noball— 
his lovo was 
hopelessi 



It happened during the col- 
onization of the Eastern Quad- 
rant, on the heavy-planet Galu- 
ben, known to you as the source 
of the aphrodisiac fleece — in your 
teenage argot the so-called jutting 
rug.’ Some of you probably be- 
lieve the claims made for the 
fleece. Quintillions of your par- 
ents did or do. You’ve heard 
about its properties. It’s said to 
make barren women fecund and 
impotent men verile. And if you 
get your gal to sit on it, she’ll go 
mellow. I won’t tell you my opin- 
ion. I’ll let my story do that. 
Anyway, it happened on Glauben, 
in my grandfather’s time. He 
played a key role in the affair. He 
described his experience as ‘the 
polities of ratticide,’ and that’ll be 
my title. But please no questions 
now. You’ll hear all you need to 
hear by-and-by- ” 

With these words the old man 
paused. The teenies in the 
B-Deck Whybar gathered around 
and settled into flato chairs to 
hear the Taler spin his yam. He 
in turn touched a glower to his 



pipe and pensively puffed on the 
device. Grains of Millusion mixed 
with tabak vaporized and drifted 
invisibly in the air, amplifying the 
teenies’ powers of imagination, 
while the great Time Ark in 
which they traveled hurtled from 
Milky Way to New Frontier. 
They were a tiny fragment of the 
Human Wave, expanding out- 
ward. 

The Taler lowered his pipe at 
last and told the following story: 

In those days Glauben wasn’t as 
famous as it is now and had been 
colonized only six hundred years. 
In fact the Eastern Quadrant was 
a vast emptiness. We hadn’t met 
the beemen of Marad, nor had wc 
found Superhole, the planet 
whose great time warp lets us slip 
through the meshes of dimension 
toward a new home in this magni- 
ficent, cunning Ark. But enough. 
You get the picture. A thousand 
planets with colonies of all sizes, 
levels of development; a million 
worlds yet to be opened; and 
Commercial System hell bent for 
leather, trying to capture its share 
of the worlds. 

Grandfather’s name was Boris- 
lav Hit, and he served in an outfit 
called STAG. The initials stood for 
Special Technical Assistance 
Corps, stag’s primary mission 
was to help colonies adapt to new 
worlds, to overcome unusual 
problems. But the colonists saw 
STAC in another light — as 



17 




System’s special good-squad mak- 
ing sure the concessions stayed in 
line. STAC also protected alien 
races, enforced the Ecology Con- 
vention, did a bit of counter- 
intelligence against those birds 
from Empire, and in a pinch in- 
vestigated crimes, corruptions, 
and malfeasance in high places. 
Popular, you understand. 

Bushy brows, bushy beard, 
round nose, shrewd squirvting 
eye, stocky build, a ready laugh. 

That was Borislav Enhildo 
Quantromer Hit, my venerable 
grandsire. 

No matter what body the tech- 
nicians grew him for this or that 
assignment, sooner or later he 
made it look like his original self. 
He had a fierce kind of will that 
molded foreign protoplasm rather 
than let it mold him. 

He never needed psy- 
adjustment after inhabiting an ar- 
tibod. That’s the kind of man he 
was. 

^^ELL, to get right to the point, 
in the year 4013, Eastern Quad- 
rant reckoning, that is, a team 
from System East, on a routine 
health inventory of Glauben (car- 
ried out quadrennially), came 
back with a ton of tapes and fed 
them to computers. 

Six months later the computers 
had consumed and digested the 
stuff. A routine report went by 
regular channels to the Depart- 
ment of Census and lay there for 



another six months. Then the data 
were prepared for assembly into 
EQ’s Quadrennial Health 
Assessment — a report the Minis- 
ter East submitted to the gov- 
ernment. Then hell broke loose. 

For the first time in two stan- 
dard decades, EQ’s health index 
had dropped by eight points. 

They quickly traced the trouble 
to the Glauben inventory. The 
Minister East had the Glauben 
data purged from his Assessment 
on the basis that they were in- 
complete. 

And early in 4014, Borislav Hit 
went out to Glauben on the trail of 
Weil’s Disease, Haverhill Fever, 
sodoku, and other odd but dis- 
turbing things like listeriosis, tox- 
oplasmosis, and lumphocytic 
choriomeningitis. 

Never fear, my dear, impatient 
Rubeema. You need not re- 
member the diseases. We’re after 
the cause. 

ELL, said the old Taler, puf- 
fing on his pipe, you can imagine 
how it was. 

Borislav, of course, was about 
to take a well-earned vacation. 
And, of course. Big Man called 
him in and told him he’d have to 
delay his pleasures for the Cause. 
And, needless to say, Borislav 
struggled. And finally, as you 
might expect, he agreed to go. 

At the end Big Man rose and 
put his arm around Borislav’s 
shoulders. He led hm toward the 



18 



GALAXY 




one-way glass through which 
Boris could see Big Man’s oh-so- 
desirable secretary. 

Big man said with a wary look: 
“Now, Agent Hit, get out there 
and clear this little matter up. 
And do it in a hurry, will you? 
That’s why we selected you. 
You’re a fast operator. As you 
know, the Minister is pacing the 
ceiling. Now I don’t want to pre- 
judice the investigation, but all of 
us around here think that it must 
just be data error. You under- 
stand. Those folks in Glauben do 
very nicely on the economic front. 
Hit. No sense antagonizing them. 
Quite a racket they’ve got going 
with that aphrodisiac goat pelt 
they export. Anyway, Hit, a word 
to the rise, right? The situation 
might l)e sensitive, and you must 
be careful but definitive. Hit. De- 
finitive and discreet. You under- 
stand, I’m sure. A delicate situa- 
tion, by all accounts.” 

In the front office Borislav 
joked with the Big Man’s secret- 
ary, a real juttable fern but always 
too busy or too virtuous to accept 
grandfather’s advances. A fast 
operator he might be, but in 
three years he’d never even oper- 
ated his hand around her 
sweetly-plump elbow. 

He waved good-bye to her with 
a catch in his throat. He’d re- 
member her on Galuben, and so 
should you. Her name was Ita 
Gitta. Keep in mind her pleasant, 
oval face, engaging smile, shy 

THE POLITICS OF RATTICIDE 



lashes. From the back she had a 
nice rumpy wobble, and from the 
front she was — she was. .how 
should I put it? She was a tail of 
two titties. 

Glauben is a heavy planet, as I 
said at the outset, several times 
standard gravity. Visitors march 
about in suits squishing with 
levitron and sleep in grav- 
adjusted hotel rooms. Boris 
couldn’t do that. He was going in- 
cognito. Nor could he wait out 
the five-year adjustment cycle. 
He had to go in now and without 
a suit. 

And here’s the first explanation 
you’ve been waiting for, 
Rubeema. 

Boris got himself an artibod. 

Artibods are no longer legal. 
They went out fifty years ago with 
the Genetic Convention pushed 
through by the Society for the 
Prevention of Protoplasmic- 
Abuses — with the aid and abet- 
ment of colonists, I might add, 
who didn’t like surreptitious vis- 
itors like my old grandpa. 

STAC had a special ship equip- 
ped with all the necessary instru- 
ments and grav- or atmosphere- 
adjusted bodies in all shapes, 
sizes, ages, and sexes resting in 
cold storage. In the Corps they 
called the ship (unofficially, of 
course) SSS Bod Boat.' 

SSS, by the way, stands for 
System Space ship. 

Bod Boat took up orbit around 

19 




Glauben’s sun. Borislav jumped 
naked into a warm p>ool of simub- 
lood with a weight attached to his 
leg. Down there he thought he’d 
drowned, but he hadn’t really. 
Simublood rushed into his lungs 
rich with oxygen. But by that 
time his restless Awareness had 
already fled. A psychomagnet 
caught him neatly and squirted 
him into the artibod he’d already 
picked out for himself — another 
stocky but smooth-shaved charac- 
ter laid on a cot in a hi-grav 
chamber. Boris settled in, opened 
the bod’s eyes, jumped up on the 
bod’s legs, hammered on the door 
with the bod’s fleshy fist, and 
cried; “Let me out of here!” with 
the bod’s voice. 

A loudspeaker answered; “All 
right. Hit. Cut the dramatics. We 
know you’re just putting it on. 
Let’s give the computer a test, 
shall we?”. 

One advantage of artibods, you 
see, was that they could be 
equipped with all manner of 
gadgets. They weren’t meant to 
live especially long. They had ter- 
rible digestive systems and tiny 
livers and non-essentials were left 
out or off. Borislav, for instance, 
couldn’t have reproduced himself 
in his new bod, and he knew that 
he’d be faithful to busy or virtu- 
ous Ita Gitta no matter what his 
Awareness might want to do. His 
lungs, muscles, and heart were 
souped up, and he had a comput- 
er in his center in place of a bit 



of kidney and a part of his 
stomach. Too bad he never had to 
use the damn thing! 

They tested the computer, and 
it worked very well. The controls 
were in the roof of his mouth and 
the playback went straight to his 
brain, and Noball, as Borislav had 
named his new bod, had already 
learned to play on the dials with a 
very clever tongue. 

So it all worked out nicely. 
Three days and no adverse reac- 
tion. Borislav started to grow a 
beard, but Noball was defective in 
that regard; the forest was sparse 
on one side and so, disgusted 
with Bioengineering, Boris started 
to shave what little there was to 
shave, and on the fifth day a 
STAC scout set him down on a 
Glauben moon on the dark side 
with papers and visas and a brief- 
case full of phony papers from a 
phony Glauben company. Sales- 
man Boris. On his way back to 
the home planet in a boxy, blue 
grav-suit that he would shed back 
on the planet’s surface. 

The Taler puffed and the teenies 
breathed Millusion. 

Now I want you to see 
Glauben. A trillion people, a 
good-sized colony with an unusu- 
ally high birthrate. One continent 
occupied, four of them empty. A 
big planet, Glauben. Big trees, 
big beasts, big mountains. Gigan- 
tic cities on coasts and inland. 



20 



GALAXY 




Soot and smoke and fantastic traf- 
fic jams. Deserts and primeval 
forests crisscrossed by highways 
and trainways and tubeways and 
airways above. Shining rivers and 
lakes. Tractors and fields. Jungles 
and tundra. I do believe Glauben 
had a little coal and oil, and in 
those days the people had a riot 
of living. Energy pulsed all 
through the planet. Factories 
hummed and people traded. They 
had a philosophy that business 
was the highest and noblest 
human occupation, Production 
was king. Growth was the nod of 
the Almighty, and when growth 
stopped or slowed down, the 
bearded one up there. .He 
frowned. 

Chief business of Glauben, then 
as now, was the sale of the aph- 
rodisiac fleece. A small business, 
in those days. It would expand to 
galactic dimensions in time — as 
you well know. All around the 
spaceport where Borislav landed, 
protected by glistening black 
sheets of plastic from the tropical 
rains, pyramids of pelts waited for 
shipment to the panting worlds. 
As Boris would discover later, the 
pelts played a role in all aspects of 
the planet’s life, which would 
make the fulfillment of his mission 
something of a problem, Ecolaws 
neither here nor there. But of 
that later. 

I told you that Borislav had a 
will of his own and sooner or later 
his artibod would do what he 

THE POLITICS OF RATTICIDE 



wished. Well, so it was on 
Glauben with Mr. Noball. 

Boris landed at the spaceport, 
one of four on Continent A. He 
turned in his grav-suit for the de- 
posit, and tossing the gold coin in 
his hand, he made for the tube- 
way gates. On the way his eye 
caught a sign in the window of a 
small concession. It said; 

TIRED OF LIVING? HAVE 
YOU LOST YOUR ZEST, 
YOUR ZING? DOES MRS. 
YOU COMPLAIN THAT YOU 
NEGLECT HER? WANT TO 
BE THE YOU YOU WERE 
WHEN YOU WERE REALLY 
YOU? AND APHRO-RUG 
TOO EXPENSIVE FOR YOU? 
DON’T FRET MR. YOU. 
WE’VE GOT WHAT YOU 
NEED. TAKE VIRILLU- 
TWO. IT’S GOOD FOR YOU 
KNOW WHOSE YOU KNOW 
WHAT! 

“Well, I’ll be damned,’’ said 
Borislav to himself rubbing the 
shaved chin of his artibod. “I’ll fix 
you up nicely. Noball.’’ 

He went up to the window and 
said; “Give me some Virillu-two, 
babe”, to the girl there. 

She gave him a tube filled with 
little round pills. 

“How do you take these?” 
She hesitated. You take one in 
the morning and. one just. 
before. She blushed a little. 

He asked; “What if I take more 

21 




than two? Will it hurt me?” 

“I don’t know,” she said, ‘Tve 
never taken these.” 

“I would guess not,” he leered. 
“I mean, does it — is it harmful?” 
“It’s a two-percent extract.” 
“Extract of what?” 

She gave him a hard stare, and 
his experienced agent Awareness 
coupled with the souped-up 
eyesight of his artibod saw her 
press a button beneath the 
counter. Two policemen began to 
move warily in his direction, and 
he inquired no further. Rather, 
he tossed the gold coin to the girl 
and made a quick get-away. Soon 
he became the trillion-and-first 
inhabitant of Glauben. But later, 
in the privacy of a little hotel, he 
swallowed the entire contents of 
the tube. 

“There you are, Noball,” he 
muttered. “That shouod make you 
act more like a man.” 

That, my children, is the kind 
of man l^e was, my grandpa. 

w ELL, he grew the biggest, 
bushiest, wildest beard on 
Glauben, a glorious red beard; 
and in addition he turned hairy 
on the chest and arms and legs; 
hair sprouted from his nostrils and 
his ears and from between his 
toes; and it got so bad he had to 
cut it daily. 

“Noball,” he said, “I do believe 
you’re overdoing it a bit.” 

In addition to these physical 
manifestations of virility, Borislav 



was sorely troubled by memories 
of Ita Gitta’s oval face, low lashes, 
and other auxiliaries, and for the 
first week of his stay on the 
planet, he forgot all about Weil’s 
Disease, Haverhill Fever, sodoku, 
listeriosis, taxoplasmosis, and 
lymphocytic choriomeningitis, and 
instead wrote her several long let- 
ters of the most poetic excellence, 
straining Noball’s competent but 
pedestrian brain to the edge of a 
fever. 

Now you must understand 
something more about artibods to 
understand what happened to 
your friend and my forebear. 

The Taler touched the glower 
to his pipe and puffed. 

Despite their obvious and la- 
mentable deficiencies in the areas 
of digestion and so forth, he con- 
tinued, which soon reduced Boris- 
lav to a fare of milkgap from 
the indigenous supergoat Guru 
(whose mountain cousin Borislav 
then naively thought was the 
source of the aphro-fleece), the 
artibods were pretty well made. 
And because they served agents 
in the field, they were full of var- 
ious repellants, anti-bodies, and 
whatnot. Little cuts and bruises 
healed with the rapidity of a 
miraculous laying on of hands. 
And fevers were zapped by 
Noball’s by no means puny 
metabolic reserves. 

Had all this not been so, Boris- 
lav would soon have sickened and 
therefore discovered the

problem — for his hotel room, 
none of the best, literally 
swarmed with xcnopsylla 
cheopis. 

That, my dear Riibeema, is a 
secret I won’t reveal just yet, but 
let it suffice if I describe this mys- 
terious Something as very small, 
very dark, capable of incredibly 
long ho]ls [foni one warm bod to 
another warm bod, and when it 
landed it could bite like blazes. 
Unfortunately for Borislav’s mis- 
sion and for his great eagerness to 
try to scale inacessible Mount Ita 
Gitta, Noball had been grown ex- 
pressly for the jungle climate ol 
Glauben’s A continent, and when 
xenopsylla cheopis did its thing. 
Noball didn’t even feel it; hence 
Borislav didn’t either; and thus 
neither became aware of the 
third. 

Now let me compound your 
puzzlement further and reveal 
that our dark little hopper carried 
rickettsia typhi, and the only 
reason why ricky-tippi didn’t 
make it into the computer banks 
of the Glauben health inventory 
was that to this disease the people 
had become immune, and the 
team from System East had lived 
in a much better hotel. The au- 
thorities had made sure of that.

ally awoke to the call of duties or 
else the worst effects of Virillu- 
Two wore off. At any rate, he be- 
came a little more aware of his

surroundings. When the buzzer 
sounded in his head, as it had 
every half hour for a week, he 
flicked his tongue to the roof of 
his mouth and growled in a voice 
that already sounded a little like 
his own: * 

“Yeah, what do you want?” 

“For the sake of the living Jus, 
Hit, what in the Cos are you 
doing?” 

“Been writing letters,” Borislav 
said. 

He had. They lay all around 
him in draft. He had penned the 
final versions on tiny pieces of 
aphro-fleece leather you could 
buy down the street in a shop. 
With a quill. In red ink. They 
were already on their way in a 
Time Collapse jumper back to the 
outer office of the Big Man who 
was now on the intercom built 
into his head. 

“Letters! God, man, the Minis- 
ter East is crawling the walls; and 
his staff is pacing the ceilings; and 
their staffs are up in the trees; 
and so the Deputy Assistant Un- 
derminister is shaking the bars; 
and his staff is rattling the cage; 
and — You know what I mean! 
They’re coming in the windows!” 
“I’m sorry. A little trouble with 
Noball.” 

“Who?” 

“My artibod.” 

There was a sad sighing in 
Borislav’s head. “All right. Hit. 
Tell me what you’ve observed so 
far. ” 

24 



“Nothing. I’ve been in this 
room, and down the street to a 
shop, and to the post office to 
mail off my letters. I’ve been buy- 
ing some goat-pap in a five- 
one — ” 

“A what?” 

“A five-one. A store. Open 
from five to one. These Glauben 
cats know how to hustle. Growth, 
they say. Business. Anyway, Big 
Man, nothing unusual. I’m look- 
ing out past this old fire-escape. 
Some smoke is rising up ahead 
there. I see all sorts of roof tops. 
And to my right is a piece of the 
ocean, and to the left I see the 
desert and some trees that look 
like palms only they’re much 
thicker. And what else? There 
was a car crash in the street last 
night, and — ” 

“Spare me. Please spare me 
that. Hit. We sent you to 
Glauben to track down disease, 
not to paint landscapes.” 

“One hellishly rickety fire- 
escape, ” Borislav said. 

“You get that artibod of yours 
out there! And start working, my 
friend, or we’ll give you a little 
stimulation.” 

“Yes, sir!” my grandfather said, 
and now he was fully awake at 
last. 



Ky a ‘little stimulation’ Big Man 
meant the stimulation of Borislav 
Enhildo Quantromer Hit, the 
original Hit, the one in that pool

of simublood with a weight 
around his leg to keep him down, 
for Borislav never lost contact 
with himself entirely, else he 
would die. He obscurely knew 
himself back there on SSS Bod 
Boat breathing in the viscous stuff 
filled with oxygen and nutrients, 
and if Big Man chose, he could 
make life miserable for that help- 
less Borislav back there or up 
there or whatever. 

But to continue. 

Borislav sat down on the edge 
of his cot and buried his bearded 
face in his hands. A little black 
Something aimed for the back of 
his neck, but Noball repelled it 
and Boris felt nothing. Instead he 
recalled his stay on the planet 
thus far, searching for clues; and 
then he discovered a nagging lit- 
tle note buried under the Virillu 
experience. The girl in the con- 
cession booth had called the cops 
when he had asked after the 
source of the extract. Now why 
would a body do a thing like that? 
Had Boris revealed himself by 
that single question? And what, 
by the way, did they have to 
hide? 

Of course, he looked like a 
Glauben man, a perfect replica of 
the planetary type. Heavy planets 
l)red them thick of limb and fat of 
jowl. They came tall as if to defy 
the gravity and, on Glauben, they 
could also tolerate a whisp of 
ammonia in the atmosphere with- 

THE POLITICS OF RATTICIDE 



out a mask. So the girl had clearly 
taken him for a native — and a na- 
tive didn’t ask? Didn’t ask that 
question, clearly. A native knew. 

About this time a knock 
sounded on his door, and the 
chamber maid came in to clean 
up. She stayed downtown as long 
as she could, and she cleaned up 
some rooms in the evening, espe- 
cially if the guest didn’t mind. 

She was used to Mr. Hit’s 
ways. The poor man sat at the 
narrow little table and scribbled 
those letters so fine. Sometimes 
he threw away a page or two and 
she read the crumpled paper in 
the basement. Tugged your heart. 
So she came in without his by- 
your-leave, surprised to see him 
idle. And he, in turn, looked up 
and saw her for the first time with 
his agent eyes wide open, as it 
were. 

He stared at her; he stared at 
the scars on her face and .on her 
hands. Upon closer inspection he 
also saw scars on her legs exposed 
beneath a drab, grey skirt. 

He pointed involuntarily to her 
face. “What’s that?” he asked. 
“What happened to you?” 

The chamber maid looked at 
him. She didn’t understand. 

“Those scars,” he said. “How 
did you get them?” 

The chamber maid immediately 
drew the right conclusion. She 
was of the lower classes and 
therefore directly exposed. She 
lived down by the wharves in a 

25 




rickety shack near where they un- 
loaded grain ships. She called 
herself lucky for working here, in 
the Grand Hotel, as the place was 
called. She didn’t have to fight 
them here although sometimes 
they invaded the basement and a 
lew lived in the walls. And so, of 
course, she guessed at once that 
Borislav was an agent, although 
he looked like anybody might, of 
the upper classes, that is. 

No, dearest Rubeema, you may 
not ask. A Taler has his rights, my 
girl, and one of them is to in- 
crease the suspense. Borislav 
didn’t know, and so you may not 
either. 

The Taler paused and lit his 
pipe again. The teenies were sil- 
ent. They leaned forward in their 
flato chairs. The blue smoke rose 
up in elaborate spirals. The Col- 
ormixer on the wall wove patterns 
in blues and reds, this time dot- 
ted with white stars. 

So. 

So the chamber maid turned 
and fled. Down the stairs she 
went. She bolted. Bolted! On the 
way she upset a bucket and mop. 
They made a tinny clatter. 

Borislav went right behind her, 
down the stairs in her wake. He 
heard her excited whisper down 
below. Then the burly man in 
shirtsleeves who sat at the night 
desk came around prepared for 
trouble. He summoned an even 
burlier porter who followed in a 

26 



dirty red jacket. They trampled 
up the stairs with grim faces and 
balled fists toward Boris. He 
didn’t trust Noball to win in this 
fray, so he ran back up to his 
room with a hop over the over- 
turned bucket and mop. He 
locked the door and entrusted his 
artibod to that hellishly rickety 
fire escape. Down he went and 
away lie went, into the night. 

Soon sirens sounded and red 
lights circled and cars bucked to a 
stop before the Grand Hotel. 

But by that time Borislav was 
well on his way toward a solution 
to his puzzlement. Let me leave 
him for a moment and regale you 
with a lecture about the Ecology 
Convention. 

Now the Eco-Convention goes 
a long way back, back to the first 
days of the Western Quadrant 
where it all started on the legen- 
dary planet Earth, but the princi- 
ple is simple enough and you 
know something about it to boot. 
If you’ve ever landed on a foreign 
planet, you know what you go 
through. They bathe you, they 
squirt you, they irradiate you. 
Every cell of your body is 
purified. The flora of your 
stomach must yield to the flora of 
their stomach. They probe be- 
neath your nails and they run 
electronic fingers up and down 
your hairs, one by one. Tourist 
planets are a little sloppy, but 
even they do the minimum. 

You ever ask yourselves why? 



GALAXY 




Well, to come around in a cir- 
cle, they do it because of the 
Ecology Convention. 

In the early days of coloniza- 
tion, in the Obscure Age of the 
Human Wave, people were less 
careful about such things, and so 
we lost entire solar systems to 
ecoblight. A tiny little beast, for 
instance, too small for the eye to 
see, can disrupt an ecosystem to 
which it isn’t adapted. That was 
and is the rationale. Of late I’ve 
noticed a slackening of vigilance. 
Total isolation never really 
worked, and now people go 
through the motions. Some of our 
learned sages conjecture in 
magazines the masses never read 
that genetic ‘pollution’ and 
‘ecosystem collisions,’ as they are 
pleased to call these phenomena, 
may even be a good thing. Others 
argue, persuasively, I think, that 
man is genetic pollutant enough, 
and anything else you might in- 
troduce won’t matter much. But 
that is neither here nor there for 
the purposes of my story. In the 
days of my grandfather Borislav, 
the Eco-Convention was not only 
taken .seriously; it enjoyed a kind 
of revival thanks to the blighting 
of Palomar IV by the Hirotishy 
sand worm — an episode you may 
research at your leisure in the 
Pedy. 

My point is this. No colonizing 
wavelet ever took to a new planet 
anything but sterilized bodies and 
sterilized tools. Period. Once on 



the surface, they could do what 
they pleased. Space-based ex- 
perimental stations (STAC oper- 
ated several thousand — they 
moved from cluster to cluster on a 
schedule) carefully tested the 
eco-relations between alien flora 
and fauna, and in rare instances 
permission was granted, say, to 
plant a Humro wheat in a Dus- 
kitanian soil; to bring in an inoc- 
cuous palm for aesthetic reasons; 
and so forth. Let me stress that 
this happened rarely, and while 
that reduced the kind of fun and 
games the Glauben corporiarchs 
still play, I think we’ve gained 
more than we lost. 

By now even you, Rubeema, 
must be getting the drift. Reluc- 
tantly your Taler has relinquished 
the reins of suspense. But you’ll 
accompany me nevertheless, I 
trust, as we find Borislav again 
and pick up the second part of 
this story. 

II 

Now you shall hear about mat- 
ters more serious than Borislav’s 
infatuation with Ita, although for 
Borislav that was serious enough. 

He fled through the evening 
crowds of Cosmopolis, the capital 
of Glauben’s Continent A. He 
hustled along with little glances 
over his shoulder (he’d flunked 
his Secret Agent course). The 
people — decked ut in evening 
clothes and redolent or perfume. 



THE POLITICS OF RATTICIDE

going to the opera and the 
theater — probably took him for a 
madman. That hair! That look in 
his eyes!? It was not my 
grandfather’s greatest hour. But 
then he wasn’t a hero in the con- 
ventional sense, just an average 
agent of STAC. (Had he had 
greatness, I would sit in the 
Lords rather than warble yams to 
teenies in a Time Ark!) 

Instinct or good sense led him 
away from the opulent center. 
Behind him police cars wailed in 
their search, stupidly racing up 
and down the geometrically laid- 
out streets of downtown Cos- 
mopolis. 

He hustled; he slowed down; 
finally he walked along casually, 
catching his breath. Street lights 
thinned out, disappeared. The 
brilliance lay far behind. Ahead 
loomed shadows, shacks, and 
palm trees in between. People on 
porches. The red glow of 
joyweed. The sweetish odor of 
fermenting garbage. 

He changed his direction at 
frequent intervals. Had he had a 
precise goal, surely he’d have lost 
his way. But he walked without 
much care although generally in 
the direction of the ocean. He 
hoped to find rest of sorts on the 
beach behind a comfortable rock. 
The surf would lull him. By morn- 
ing he’d figure out something. 

On this mad planet, every 
question he asked got him in 
trouble! 



And then, not far from the 
beaches, he made his discovery. 

At that moment he walked be- 
side a tenement of sorts in the 
dark, narrow, unpaved street of a 
poor and shabby quarter. An alley 
to his right. A little ways ahead a 
vaulted doorway led into some 
kind of courtyard. 

Boris ducked into the alley be- 
cause he saw the headlights of a 
car turn into his street and judged 
it safer to hide. The big, sleek 
cars Clauben folk used seemed to 
have no place in this neighbor- 
hood. He guessed it was a cop. 

In his haste he stumbled over 
something. The Something gave 
an angry squeal. He felt a sharp 
bite on his leg. Noball’s splendid 
metabolism immediately healed 
the wound, but Borislav lost his 
balance and fell against what had 
looked like a tree trunk but 
turned out to be a garbage can 
thickly covered with large, hairy 
creatures that scampered off as he 
lurched into the car. 

Then he saw movement all 
across the alley. The ground had 
begun to move. Greenish eyes 
glowed in the darkness. Feet 
scurried over broken glass. 

At the same time, involuntarily, 
Boris had a vision of Ita Gitta. A 
wish-vision, if you like. She beck- 
oned with a hand while with the 
other she held a flimsy veil over 
her obviously naked front. 

Gome, Borislavissimus. Come, 
Borislavissimine. 



28 



GALAXY 




Boris shivered. Traces of 
Virillu-Two? There was a rank 
odor in the air. The car wobbled 
past on the uneven clay surface of 
the street. Up above him he 
heard faint laughter. 

He stood in a kind of daze for a 
moment longer, and then he 
realized what he had seen. 

What in the depth of damna- 
tion! he cried in his thoughts. 
Noball, wake up! Did you see 
what I saw? 

He had seen rats. He’d seen a 
plague of rats. They had filled the 
alley. They had fed on garbage 
from several upright and several 
upturned cans. Only, of course, 
that couldn’t possibly be. And 
Borislav calmed himself. He had 
also seen Ita Gitta, nearly naked, 
at that. And he knew she couldn’t 
be here in this alley, and neither 
could the rats, and so it must 
have been that powerful hair tonic 
he’d swallowed like a blooming 
fool. 

But then, almost as if to make 
liars of his thoughts, he saw them 
again. They came slowly in single 
file. They hugged the walls, long 
whiskers in touch with the brick, 
green eyes aglow. They stared at 
him. They came toward him, to- 
ward the food. They resumed 
feeding with quick nervous 
glances at Boris, and as they filled 
the alley he again hallucinated the 
girl, but only for a second; for 
now he was overcome vvith a 
powerful pulse of anger.

THE POLITICS OF RATTICIDE 



29 





No hell-vision could taunt 
Borislav Hit with demonic impun- 
ity. It these were rats, he’d catch 
himself one and feel its furry real- 
ity with his hands. And if he saw 
what wasn’t th^re, those clowns 
from Bioengineering could just 
pull him off this planet in a hurry, 
and he’d personally see to it that 
Noball went into the vat. 

He grabbed a piece of broken 
beam and hit at the nearest rat in 
a fury, but the beast leaped to the 
side and the beam raised a tinny 
ruckus ^s it hit the barbage can 
and its leaning lid fell off. He 
rampaged among the rats. He ran 
up and down the alley, a weird, 
bushy-bearded, stocky berserker 
in the light of Glauben’s moon 
which, at that very moment, 
peeked past the roof of the 
tentement to shed its milky light 
on the scene. 

Borislav failed to catch a rat. 
They were too quick and agile 
and disappeared long-tailed into 
burrows and holes. In a moment 
he stood alone again in the moon- 
light with a stump of wood in his 
hand. 

“Just you wait, ” he whispered 
fiercely, throwing the beam away. 
“Come on. Noball. If force won’t 
do it, cunning will.’’ 

He picked an appropriate bur- 
row, melted into the shadow of 
the wall, and waited. After a 
while a whiskered nose peeked 
out. Then came a head followed 
by the long, fat, pear-shaped body 



of a rat heading away from Boris- 
lav toward the sweetish smell of 
fermenting waste — except that it 
didn’t get very far, for Boris 
leaped out after it like a warball 
player on a flying tackle. Noball’s 
souped-up hands grabbed the crea- 
ture just as it turned with a 
fierce snarl and bit Borislav on 
the wrist. Borislav endured the 
bites and scrambled to his feet. 
He cracked the rat’s head against 
the brick and the creature shud- 
dered before it went limp. 

The Taler fell silent. He 
knocked out his pipe and refilled 
it carefidly from a porcellain bowl 
inlaid with snakes of gold. The 
glower glowed red. Smoke rose. 
The Taler stared into the dis- 
tance. 

Well now, children, he re- 
sumed at last, what now follows is 
both a little sad and a little dif- 
ficult to relate, for it involves sev- 
eral simultaneous states of mind 
on the part of my granddad and 
your friend, Borislav Enhildo 
Quantromer Hit, owing to the 
powerful effect of the dead rat’s 
emanations, which confused his 
consciousness to an extreme de- 
gree. On top of that, he had a big 
heart, no matter what body he 
had on, and he felt what he heard 
and saw deeper perhaps than 
another one might. 

Lest you lose your way in his 
thoughts, let me tell you what re- 
ally happened at the outset. Boris-

lav went into the courtyard he 
had glimpsed earlier, carrying his 
rat. He fell into a conversation 
with a youngster in his early 
teens. The boy took him into the 
tenement and there Boris spoke 
to an older man. Then he con- 
tinued toward the beach. On the 
way he bought some goat milk. 
That’s the action and here’s what 
it was like. 

Waves of violent longing pulsed 
through Noball’s hands and arms 
and up into Borislav’s Awareness. 
He chased after Ita’s receeding 
naked form through marbled cor- 
ridors, past squirting fountains. In 
the simublood of SSS Bod Boat’s 
hold tank, the fully equipped 
body of the original and inimita- 
ble Borislav Quantromer under- 
went physiological changes that 
would have embarrassed its ab- 
sent owner, but fortunately only 
computers watched, and they 
translated what they saw into 
huge, sharp peaks on a hormone 
graph. 

Hold the bleeder by the jutting 
tail, man. Can’t you see that some 
infernal something comes up 
through that jutting pelt? Yeah, 
Noball, drag our buddy along by 
the tail. That’s better, really. 

Diminished vibrations. 

A trillion rats swarmed in 
Borislav’s Awareness filling war- 
rens under half the continent. 
Tribe upon tribe of rat; regi- 
ments, kingdoms, empires of 
rodenticity. A billion nests 

THE POLITICS OF RATTICIDE 



squeaked with the newborn. A 
billion nest odors rose warmly 
into channels of clay. Rat wars. 
The waxing and the waning of 
ratty dynasties. A few centies be- 
neath soil surface lived a red root 
fungus native to Glauben — like all 
things except man and this repul- 
sive rat. The fungus had learned 
to live in the rat’s epidermis and 
its waste products engendered a 
strange effluvium. 

He gathered this from the 
youngster. 

The youngster wouldn’t talk at 
first. Borislav tossed a gold coin 
alluringly. It glinted in the milky 
light of Glauben’s moon. The rat 
lay on the uneven stones that 
paved the courtyard, its tail in 
Noball’s hand. 

And so? What do they eat? 

Hey, Mister. You’re goofy. 
What don’t they eat? 

The youngster’s right arm was 
missing at the elbow. It ended in 
a stump. He waved it in Borislav’s 
face. Two of his toes were also 
missing, and his young face was 
white with moon-shaped scars. 

Each day at dusk, caravans of 
trucks loaded with specialized 
equipment moved out into the 
jungle hinterlands and the tundra 
areas of the continent from the 
myriad settlements of Galuben. 
The men set up intricate barriers 
of netting. Others inserted sonic 
devices into selected burrows 
picked by computers from aerial 
maps. Then at a signal — see the 

31 




white smoke of the flare fi-om the 
gun of the man in charge? He 
stands by his dune-buggy on top 
of the rise — the sonics blasted 
away. See the land explode with 
swarms of, rats? See the rats 
caught in the elaborate nets. 

Look out, Mister. If you don’t 
watch it, the brothers will eat 
your rat.. 

Come on. Noball, pull that 
beast out of their ravenous teeth. 
Go on, pull away, rip it away. 
Scoot, brothers, get back, get 
away. 

And? 

And in the rancid odor of the 
red root fungus waste reacting 
with the epidermic layers of rat 
pelt, Ita Gitta again sailed down a 
marble hall in the costume of the 
first woman while fountains 
played. 

Their steps echoed through the 
tentement. The rat scraped on the 
floor. Out of dark holes in the 
wall live rats darted out and 
snapped at their dead brother. 
Naked children bunched at the 
end of the corridor and ran way 
only to stop and bunch and look 
again with fingers in their mouth. 
Disfigured children. 

Is it laughter that I hear? And 
do I have a strange sensation that 
every human in this building one 
minute past pubescence groans in 
the act of reproduction? 

Now the rats were dead and on 
fast-moving portable conveyor 
belts they entered the automatic 

32 



skinning machines. My uncle, he 
can tell you all about that, he 
worked on one all his life. 

Noball, you’re not watching. 
Our rat has lost its head and trails 
an ooze of blood. The youngster 
limped. You can’t walk straight 
with toes missing, now, can you? 
That’s my uncle there. You better 
give him a coin too. He’s blind. 
Ask your cjuestions. 

How do children survive in this 
place? Or is that the wrong ques- 
tion to ask? 

The automatic shinning device, 
you see. Mister, is fast as any- 
thing, and people don’t have to 
handle the pelts, which is a good 
thing. The emanations are 
strongest just after a rat dies. Of 
course, you understand — and 
thank you for the gold florin; my 
retirement pay won’t buy the 
bread — they lose a good bit of the 
pelt. The yield is a few square 
centies a beast, but it’s a trade- 
off, like we used to say in the 
crews. The pieces are collected 
and they go through drying 
drums, around and around. They 
run the drier gases through cryo- 
coolers to collect the extract. 
Then the dried pelt-pieces are 
shipped off to be stitched into 
pelts after a careful color sort. 

The youngster pointed to a 
baby cot completely encased by a 
strong wire cage. He held up the 
stick he carried. At its end Boris- 
lav saw the sharp glint of a blade. 
“That’s how, ’’ the boy said. 



GALAXY 




In an obscure corner of the 
crowded room something moved 
rythmically beneath some blank- 
ets. 

The boy’s stick-blade chopped 
at a skinny fellow who’d followed 
the blood-trail into the room. 

Now see that portable pipeline 
vomit red liquid residues from 
skinning trucks back to the 
ground. See the stuff ooze into 
burrows. 

The blind man said: “Mister, 
they’re not trying to eradicate 
them. What do you think? They 
want ’em to breed] In no time at 
all the burrows they clean out are 
full again, and the new ones eat 
what’s left of the old ones. ” 

The old man spoke a vision of 
sleek men and women in 
mountain-top castles. He spoke 
(dectronic apparatus around the 
castles and thick wire deep be- 
neath and above the ground, 
hard-meshed and gnaw-resistant. 
Me spoke yachts on the ocean, all 
pretty and white and sun-bronzed 
beautiful people in white walking 
the white decks with glasses in 
hand and smiling. He spoke fat 
bankrolls delivered to the bank by 
trucks thickly armored and guards 
who held pistols in their hands, 
lie spoke spaceships lifting off 
into the sky. 

But all this is a violation of the 
l^cology Convention. 

The what? 

The building sang a rising 
( liorus of Growth Growth Growth 



Sigh. Growth Growth 
Growth Growth Growth Growth 
Sigh. 

The children bunched around 
the door and listened with fingers 
hooked into lips and with knife- 
sticks in hand. Their bellies were 
large and extended, their eyes 
dark and round in pale narrow 
faces. Someone laughed some- 
where as Ita Gitta looked out 
from behind a marble column 
with an eye and a tit. 

The building sang sodoku and 
Haverhill Fever transmitted re- 
spectively by streptobacillus 
moniliformis and spirillum minus, 
both of which live happily on the 
gums and teeth of rats. Through 
minute cuts and abrasions 
leptospira icterohemorrhagiae sang 
in the bloodstream of rat piss and 
Weil’s Disease. And on a flourish 
from the knife-tipped baton of the 
boy, toxoplasmosis, listeriosis, and 
lymphocytic choriomeningitis 
joined in the Lesions, Sores, and 
Fevers Song. 

Ancient, blind operator of a rat 
skinning machine, tell me this. 
Why do they hunt them in the 
jungles and the tundra and why 
not here in the city where they 
are as thick as a carpet? 

Bearded stranger so full of gold, 
I never operated a skinning 
machine. I had a more humble 
assignment. After the gorge dis- 
charged into the soil and the 
caravan formed up to take us 
back, my colleagues and I crawled 



THE POLITICS OF RATTICIDE 



33 




into the drums, and while the 
trucks bounced home, we cleaned 
and replaced the blades. I hold 
up my arms so you can see the 
many cuts I received in my life’s 
work. Put your finger to the 
leathery skin and feel the tangles 
of hard tissue. 

But I asked you. 

Here in the city? Stranger, it 
would be uneconomical to hunt 
them here. It wouldn’t be cost- 
effective. We were efficient, I tell 
you. We processed four hundred 
kay a day out there on an off day. 
Now here, in the city, it would be 
much too costly. And the pelts 
are less nice. The children stick 
them in the back and the soil 
here is deficient in the red root 
Ringus that interacts with the rat 
epidermis to create the won- 
drously aphrodisiac effect. 

He dragged the headless rat 
through the tentement, across the 
poorly paved courtyard, and out 
into the uneven clay street. He 
stopped and tossed a handful of 
gold toward the children bunched 
in the vaulted courtyard door. 
High up someone laughed. 

He walked along toward the 
beach, and as he made progress 
so did the hungry rats who came 
behind him. They darted forward 
and took bites of their brother, 
jerking hard on the carcass so that 
Noball’s hands had trouble hold- 
ing the tail. Borislav was in a 
daze. He thought he sensed rats 
everywhere, up on the roof tops 

34 



sitting like a green-eyed chain of 
beads; in the windows, tails 
a-curl; in the crowns of palms. 

Finally Noball’s fingers held 
only a tail. Borislav made Noball 
throw it away. Up head he saw 
the red-white-and-blue light of a 
five-one. He went in and asked 
for a gallon gourd of Guru juice. 

The rest is short. On the beach, 
surrounded on all sides by sus- 
picious little mounds and doubtful 
tracks in the sand, Borislav shud- 
dered and cast his eye out to sea. 
Out there he perceived a small 
light and heard the faraway clang 
of a bell buoy. He checked his 
gourd seal and slowly walked into 
the water. He swam out into the 
night, using Noball’s souped-up 
body to its limit, until he reached 
the buoy, a large affair and in- 
credibly loud at close proximity. 
He crawled up on the platform. 
He tied his wet coat jacket to the 
bell’s tongue to silence the critter. 
Then he put out the Red Priority 
call for STAC Emergency Opera- 
tions. 

What’s that, Rubeema? A ‘gal- 
lon’? A gallon is an ancient meas- 
ure of liquids. It isn’t used now 
and it wasn’t used on Glauben 
then. But Talers are permitted a 
little poetic license when it suits. 

Ill 

Cheer up, children, why so 
gloomy? The Whybar of your 
Time Ark is a place of truth. To 



GALAXY 




live is to laugh, to smile, no mat- 
ter what. I sing of man and of his 
folly. I sing also of man’s large 
and generous heart, the heart of 
my granddad, one Borislav Hit, 
who’d seen worse things and bet- 
ter, and who knew how to take 
the sweet with the alkaline. 

Here it was dawn over the 
Glauben world ocean, a rosy light 
sat on the saddle of the wine-red, 
heaving sea. Borislav had snoozed 
in comfort, a sandbag under his 
hair-bush head, rocked and cra- 
dled in the waters. The air smel- 
led fresh and sweetly saline. The 
waves splashed gently against the 
buoy. Was Borislav cheerless? 
Nay, nay. He jumped up filled 
with energy again; he cracked the 
goat-gourd and swallowed some 
milk. “Hey, there,” he cried to a 
large red gull approaching to sit 
on top of the structure. He had 
forgotten the night. He looked 
toward the future. He was an 
agent of STAC, and agents of 
STAC looked forward, not back. 
They didn’t keep score. They 
picked themselves up. 

Borislav had put in his call for 
Kmergency Operations, and the 
response to his call was 
instantaneous — that is to say in- 
stantaneous by STAC standards, 
which meant that Borislav spent 
nearly a week on the buoy waiting 
for the spaceships to land. But he 
used his time wisely, and the 
(Juru milk lasted the whole 
lime — it was the perfect fare for 



Noball’s troubled digestive sys- 
tem. 

Borislav sought answers to 
three questions, and he caused 
several scandals and dozens of in- 
vestigations by asking — no mean 
feat for an unwashed agent talking 
to himself on a swaying buoy in 
the Blauben sea. STAC was popu- 
lar, as I’ve said. 

Item. He wondered out loud to 
the System authorities how come 
that health team had found any 
evidence of disease. Surely the 
local authorities were more clever 
than that? Why had earlier teams 
found no sign of that long list of 
diseases that I shan’t repeat again, 
dearest Rubeema. The answer 
was: by accident or by the 
treasonous activity of some official 
of the Clauben Department of 
Health. For, as it turned out, 
health teams come to Clauben 
were soon engaged in mindless 
debaucheries in low-grav hotel 
rooms for the duration of their 
stay, while the local boys put to- 
gether sanitized data. Someone 
had slipped into that carefully 
selected packet of tapes one or 
two with authentic information. 

Item. He wondered out loud 
how rattus norvegicus had gained 
a gnaw-hold on this planet? Who 
had inspected the colonizing ships 
on the airless moon of Clauben 
six hundred years ago? And as the 
answer of bribery and kick-backs 
came kicking back, the reputation 
of several Underministers was 



THE POLITICS OF RATTICIDE 



35 




smirched posthumously in the 
process, and it turned out that the 
Galuhen settlers had thought to 
sneak in the seeds of lacrema 
veni, the levitating flower, think- 
ing they’d make a killing on levit- 
ron; but in protecting their seed 
stores, they protected norvegicus 
as well, which adaptable creature 
soon learned to live in the hi-grav 
conditions and soon made friends 
with a certain red root fungus a 
few centies below soil surface. 
Glaubenites still praise their good 
fortune. 

Item. How come, Boris 
asked — in a voice increasingly his 
own — how come that the famous 
Computer on Pappa hadn’t nailed 
the correlation between those dis- 
eases and the rat? “You did ask 
Computer, now, didn’t you?” he 
growled. Computer had been 
asked. Unfortunately, they told 
Boris, it took five million skilled 
people to keep Computer pro- 
grammed. What with the low pay 
and status that clung like an odor 
to feeders, they had three million 
vacancies at the Temple, and 
so. “What in the Cos does 
the Pappa-C do?” “He balances 
the System East budget, 
Boris. ...” “Oh, Jus Chris!” 

By about the fifth day the Guru 
milk ran out. Borislav took a slip 
of indestructible scriptoplast from 
his field notebook and wrote a 
message on it. He stuck the mes- 
sage in the bottle, resealed the 
translucent container, and tossed 



it to the waves. The message said: 

“Darling Ita, wherever you may 
be on the shores of the Cosmic 
Sea, know that Boris-love-issi- 
you.” 

]W!ay I have a glass of water? 
Thank you. Your name is Fran- 
cisco, isn’t it? Thank you, Fran- 
cisco. 

The Taler drank and continued. 

Now it is time for you to see 
my grandsire in a new role. Boris- 
lav the Boss. He takes command 
of Task Force-STAC, four super- 
transports in orbit around the 
planet and nine hundred thousand 
troops on the ground, brought 
down in fleets of shuttles that 
land on large segments of desert 
in the center of Continent A. Fol- 
lowing a radio signal, a hydro- 
plane glides to a halt in a track of 
foam. Boris leaves his bell buoy. 
And then, as the PAC or Plan- 
etary Agent in Charge, he is sud- 
denly the peak of a pyramid of 
people, all of them in dark brown, 
rubbery and sterilized levitron 
suits. Rapidly a sizeable city is 
built on the desert — command 
post, staff buildings, barracks for 
the troops. Communications are 
laid. People salute Borislav En- 
hildo Quantromer Hit, and in the 
best tradition of a military leader, 
he acknowledges these signals of 
respect with a lazy wave from 
Noball. Members of his legal and 
public relations staff travel to 
Cosmopolis and there present to 



36 



GALAXY 




the Concession formal charges of 
willful violation of the Ecology 
Convention. A set of orders is 
handed over. All of the planet’s 
rat-catching enterprises are soon 
drafted — men and caravans — to 
serve under orders of TF-S’TAC. 
And while shuttle ships land phys- 
ical pyramids of chemicals on a 
day-night schedule, Borislav leans 
over newly minted operations 
plans in his headquarters quonset. 

Few people can take a change 
so great. But Borislav was an 
agent of STAC. He made the 
transition without so much as a 
blink in Noball’s eyes. One day a 
rat catcher drunk on aphrodisiac, 
the next day a generalissimo 
commanding forces. All in a day’s 
work. Nothing to get shook up 
about. Tomorrow he might imper- 
sor ate a belly dancer some- 
where — although, truth to tell, 
Borislav would’ve been a bearded 
belly dancer. 

The Task Force members en- 
joyed this assignment. They 
chafed a little at Borislav’s first 
command — no repeat no 
grav-tents would be used. 
Everyone had to wear the squishy 
levitron suits (except Boris of 
course; he had an artibod). He 
didn’t want his force to stage the 
greatest orgy in the history of 
.STAC — a high possibility consid- 
ering that half the members were 
women. In the suits all were 
protected — from the smell and 
the temptation both. But STAC 

THE POLITICS OF RATTICIDE 



liked the operation. Rat eradica- 
tion was the most common excer- 
cise in the Corps owing to the 
cunning and adaptability of rattus, 
more truly Man’s inseparable 
companion than canis familiaris. 
Easy, no trouble, you knew ex- 
actly what to do and how to set it 
up — although the more grizzled 
colonels admitted that STAC had 
never had to do so large an opera- 
tion. Most planet concessionaires 
wanted their rats controlled; 
they’d never let things get so out 
of hand. 

You can see it. A holiday at- 
mosphere hung about the camp. 
Strike teams headed out laughing 
and joking over their intercoms to 
all corners of the continent. Un- 
happy locals waited for orders and 
deployed their caravans. Mam- 
moth incinerators were fabricated 
and set up. Within days the 
smoke of burned rat lay dark over 
the land — and yet the work had 
barely begun. 

Borislav remembered the 
tentement where the stump- 
armed boy had introduced him to 
the blind knife cleaner. His heart 
swelled with magnanimity. He 
picked an elite team from the 
nine hundred thousand. They 
flew in copters to the area of the 
tentements. They staked out a 
neighborhood of several square 
kilms for the operation. The peo- 
ple were evacuated in re- 
quisitioned buses. Boris found the 
boy and kept him by his side. 

37 




“Now, son,” he said in a gruff, 
fatherly way, “now you’ll see 
something!” 

Then, after the initial survey 
had been taken and the comput- 
ers had 5/ielded a pattern, gas 
trucks drove up and pumped sul- 
fur dioxide, hydrogen cyanide, 
and methyl bromide into holes 
and burrows. Huge water mains 
were diverted to flush out the 
subterranean massgraves of rat- 
dom. Bait was laid for animals 
that might have escaped — a rich 
fare of strychnine, zinc phos- 
phide, various arsenicals, thallium 
sulfate, barium carbonate, yellow 
phosphorus, and wondrous an- 
ticoagulants. What the gas didn’t 
get and the water didn’t drown, 
internal hemorrhages, pleural ef- 
fusion, kidney destruction, gas- 
troenteritis, heart paralysis, con- 
vulsions, exhaustion, and asphyxia 
ripped away permanently into Rat 
Walhalla. Then they repeated the 
operation. Finally, STAC forces 
laid a wire wall around Borislav’s 
pet areas, three meters deep into 
the ground, eight meters into the 
air — gnaw-proof, electrified, much 
like those that protected the man- 
sions of the rich. 

To the rats he was Hitler the 
Hun. To the people Schweitzer 
the Saint. He filled Noball’s lungs 
with pride. He gestured to the 
grizzled colonels. “Let the people 
return,” he said grandly with a 
lazy wave of Noball’s hand. 

The buses came back. In an- 



ticipation Borislav had mounted 
on the hood of a huge truck near 
the break in the wire; he stood 
there with his arms folded across 
his chest, his hairy chin out, his 
eyes far-seeing. The boy leaned 
against a tire of the truck. He 
played with his knife-stick, eyes 
on the clay. 

Imagine Borislav’s surprise 
when — instead of the joy and 
laughter he had expected — the 
people limped by surly and glum 
with nary a look at their hirsute 
saviour. A tiny grin on Borislav’s 
puss slowly faded. 

He leaned down toward the 
boy. “Tell me, son. Why are they 
unhappy? They should be laugh- 
ing, dancing, jumping up and 
down. What is this?” 

The boy said; “Mister, you’ve 
destroyed their livelihood.” 

“How now, boy?” 

“How now. Mister? I’ll tell you 
how now. Most of the men here 
work in the caravans. Most of the 
women sew pelts in the city. The 
men — they’re out there now 
under the command of your 
weird-looking spacemen destroy- 
ing what feeds us. The women 
have been laid off. When you’re 
gone and all the rats are 
dead. ...” 

“What, son? Speak up. ’ 

“We’ll starve, that’s what.” 
Borislav said: “Son, it’ll be bet- 
ter! How can you call this living. 
Look at your people. Look at 
them limp by without toes. Look 



38 



GALAXY 




at those hands with fingers mis- 
sing. Look at the white scars and 
sores and lesions. Just look at 
those children, marked for life. 
You’re wrong. This can’t be. They 
should be happy.” 

The boy laughed drily. “Who 
asked you to do us good?” he 
asked. He broke his knife-stick 
over his knee. He used his stump 
most artfully to hold one end of 
the stick in the process. 

Borislav pouted in silence. 
After a moment he said: “Who’s 
trying to do good, boy? Tm just 
doing my job.” 

“Then why are you standing up 
there on that truck?” 

Borislav snorted. He jumped oflF 
the truck and went to his helicop- 
ter. “Take oflF,” he barked at the 
pilot. “Ingrates,” he muttered. “I 
hope the rats come back, I do. 
Don’t you. Noball?” But Noball 
said nothing. He had something 
with his stomach. 

The copter flew too high for 
Borislav to see — and even 
Noball’s souped-up eyes couldn’t 
see through walls — hundreds of 
(.'oncession agents going frorn 
person to person with sheafs of 
petitions in hand. While TF- 
STAC gathered rats. Concession 
gathered signatures. They asked 
the rich and they asked the poor. 
They walked up spiralling walk- 
ways to mountain tops and 
gathered signatures around tables 
ol the most exquisite construction 



and polish. 'They ducked into ill- 
smelling hovels and gathered illit- 
erate X’s in gloom. Nobody ar- 
gued, nobody refused. Elsewhere 
a certain health official of the 
Concession Department of Health 
was apprehended by the au- 
thorities and put against the wall 
with his eyes blindfolded some 
fine dawn. And eventually ac- 
tivities invisible to Borislav’s Aw- 
areness and Noball’s eyes had 
consequences. 

Wondrous charts had been con- 
structed ahd lined the walls of 
Ratticide Central. Black bars on 
graphs showed the estimated rat 
population on Glauben, and red 
bars indicated the number killed, 
region by region. The red bars 
climbed slowly, trying to catch 
the black. Borislav liked to sit in 
the room and watch staffers post 
changes as reports rolled in from 
the seven corners after each in- 
cinerator burn-out. 

One day, midmorning, in the 
third week of the operation, a 
buzzer sounded in Borislav’s ar- 
tihead. He moved an expert ton- 
gue to establish the connection. 
Big Man was on the line, and 
Borislav instantly smelled a rat — if 
you’ll forgive the expression. 

“Hit.” 

“Sir.” 

“What in the hell are you 
doing?” 

“Killing rats.” 

“Thought so. Goddamned, Hit, 
you stop that at once. I want or- 



THE POLITICS OF RATTICIDE 



39 




ders out this instant to cease and 
desist.” 

Borislav waited for a moment. 
Then he said: “Big man, you can’t 
chew me out for this. You gave 
the orders; you approved the op- 
eration. I remember your words, 
Big Man. You said, ‘Good show. 
Hit. A competent job.’ So don’t 
try to sit on me now.” 

“You sandbagged me. Hit. You 
pulled a sack over my head. You 
didn’t tell me how sensitive this 
issue is.” 

“What do you mean, sensitive?” 
“Do you realize what clout 
those Glauben people have? Jus 
Chris, Hit, the House is in an up- 
roar and the Lords are. .are. .” 
“Crawling the walls.” 

“That’s right. Hit. They’re walk- 
ing the ceiling. And the Minister 
is shaking the bars.” 

“That’s your problem. Big Man. 
I’m not in politics.” 

“It is your problem. Hit. You 
blundered in there like the god- 
damned fool that you are, with 
both of your left feet in your 
ears — ” 

“Mouth,” Borislav corrected. 
“Mouth, Hit. Dammit, you 
should’ve told me about the 
aphro-fleece, the connection, I 
mean.” 

“I did. Big Man.” 

“Well, then, dammit, you 
should’ve told me about the 
economic value of that trade.” 
“You knew that. Big Man.” 
“Well, dammit. Hit, why didn’t 

40 



you tell me that fifteen hundred 
Concession executives would 
show up on Pappa? They’re 
tramping all over the planet. In 
the House, the Lords. They sit in 
the offices of every Underminis- 
ter. All you see around here is 
Glauben executives in those blue 
gravity suits with thick pads of 
lead on their feet. Goddamned, 
Hit, you should’ve told me!” 
“What’s that got to do with the 
Eco-Convention?” 

“The what?” 

“The Eco-Convention.” 

“Oh, for Chris’ sake. Hit. Wake 
up to reality. You realize that that 
steam is building for a regional 
amendment to the E-C in the 
House? The Lords will go for it 
unanimously. You heard me. Hit. 
Cease and desist. I want orders to 
stop the killing. In writing. ” 

“I’ll give the orders. Big Man. 
But System East can’t amend the 
Eco-Convention. That’s uncon- 
stitutional. Section 209, re- 
member?” 

Big Man’s fury could almost be 
heard. His sputters seemed to 
moisten Noball’s brain. “That’s 
not for you to determine. Hit. 
That’s a matter for the General 
Counsel. Do as I say. I’ve got to 
run. All I’ve done these past four 
days is fend off Glauben execu- 
tives. There’s another one shuffl- 
ing toward my office now. Miss 
Gitta, ask the gentleman to wait. 
Hit, today it’s the Deputy Assis- 
tant Underminister. They’re going 

GALAXY 




to meet him — to appeal your in- 
excusable actions. And they’ll 
keep on going to the very top. I 
know these types. Tomorrow the 
Assistant Underminister. And day 
lifter tomorrow the Underminis- 
ler. And then you know who\ See 
what schlock you’ve got me into? 
I’m climbing the cage.” 

“Well, Big Man, when you see 
Minister East, tell him to veto the 
hill.” 

"In writing,” the Big Man 
»iiarled, and suddenly there was 
imly a hum in Borislav’s head. 

Borislav understood the not-so- 
siibtleties of bureaucratic slither- 
ing. The Glauben program was 
threatened! Well, by Jus, he’d do 
something about it. “Let’s assume 
that the Minister’s heart is stout,” 
he muttered. “Let’s assume he 
won’t try to wiggle through the 
meshes of the law. Let’s assume 
hi'’s a great man, tough but fair 
iiikI warm and human and all 
that.” 

Boris calculated his chances. 

( !ould he arrive in time? Yep, he 
(Irtided. And within the hour he 
was on his way to Pappa in a fast 
Time Collapse scout. But before 
he left he went back to the quon- 
set. He took a crumpled piece of 
\ ellow paper from the vast clutter 
on his desk. In a writing so tiny 
only the souped-up hand of 
Nohall could render it, he wrote 
llie following words in a corner: 
I'o TF-STAC Glauben. Order: 
Stop killing the rats forthwith. 



He dated the slip and signed it 
PAC. Then he carefully shuffled it 
under the litter. 

“My secretary is efficient,” he 
muttered to himself. “Surely 
she’ll find it. ” 

Such a man was grandfather 
Borislav Hit. • 

Now you’ll be surprised to hear 
what Borislav did. Remember that 
he was still in his artibod, and 
when he landed on Pappa, he 
couldn’t move about freely as he 
might have inside the original 
Quantromer who still breathed 
simublood not far from the planet 
of Glauben now many parsecs 
away. He had to do what the 
Glauben executives had done. 
After he’d been sterilized in the 
heavy-planet sector of Customs, 
he donned a blue gravity-suit. It 
had a generator on the back, just 
beneath the rump — a big, fat, 
ball-shaped tail. (The generator 
made it difficult to sit, but the 
grav-suit had been developed 
under a government contract and 
its manufacture was still heavily 
subsidized, so no one said a 
word.) It had shoes with thick 
lead soles, and the suit was so 
heavy, he shuffled along like any 
other Glauben executive. He fil- 
led his pockets with florins from 
Glauben and hailed himself a cab. 
The cables Jostled madly to give 
him a ride. The GE’s had spread 
money thickly on Pappa, and they

hadn’t even neglected the cabs. 

“To the Minister’s tower,” Boris 
growled, and his voice sounded 
strangely hollow through the suit’s 
intercom. "Step on it.” 

Away they went. 

You’ve Yiever been to Pappa, so 
I’ll give you a glimpse. Pappacap- 
polus, the capital, a jewel by the 
sea. Towers, graceful and slender. 
Hundreds of thousands. From the 
spaceport white chalk mountains 
rise on the left; ultramarine lies 
the ocean white-capped to the 
right; and the towers stand in 
central splendor in between. The 
dominant tree-type is a willow 
weeping in the salty spray. 

In the spacious, fountained 
square around the ministerial 
tower, cabs unloaded GE’s — blue, 
boxy men whose face-glass threw 
back the sun. They shuffled into 
elevators. They rose up to the 
topmost flloor. It rotated slowly at 
so great a height that you could 
look beyond the chalky mountains 
into Printout Plain where the 
Temple of Pappa Computer sat far 
away in a haze. 

“Come in, come in. How do 
you do.” 

Flesh hands shook glove hands. 

The Clauben executives shook 
their way up the hierarchical lad- 
der beginning with Big Man and 
then on up through the long chain 
of command all the way past the 
Underminister and into a gigantic 
conference room. Pretty girls at- 
tached suckers to their suits and 



asked in oozing tones: “Coffee, 
tea, or Curu juice?” — the last in 
deference to Clauben, but only 
one of the executives opted for 
Curu. 

At last all were seated (more or 
less comfortably) and the Minister 
came in flanked by the leaders of 
House and Lords. 

He welcomed the blues in li- 
quid Pantongue. Then each CE 
took from his pocket a framed 
holograph and set it up so that 
the Minister might see the face 
behind the mask. One of the Ex- 
ecutives excused himself saying 
he’d inadvertently left his pic be- 
hind. 

The Minister made a speech. 
The Chairman of the Clauben 
Concession made a speech. The 
faceless exec punctuated the 
Chairman’s remarks with loud 
“Hear! Hearls” accompanied by 
thumps of his thick glove on the 
table. He called “Hear! Hear!” at 
somewhat awkward moments: for 
instance when the Chairman said 
“. .and let us assume for the 
sake of argument, Excellency, 
that the Breeding Stock is 
eradicated. .’’ and once when 
the Chairman said “. .we re- 
spect the Constitution, of course, 
but. .” The blues leaned to- 
gether on their side of the table 
and whispered on private circuits. 
Big Man looked at the faceless 
exec and began to sweat. 

If you' ve been expecting a loud 
debate between Minister East and 



42 



GALAXY 




the GE’s, teenies, you would be 
wrong — and in that case it is well 
for you to sit in the Whybar. No 
debate, of course. When the 
Chairman had had his say, the 
Minister East cleared his throat 
and replied as follows: 

“Distinguished Chairman. If I 
understand your assessment, it is 
that our Constitutional lawyers 
see matters in exactly the same 
light as your Constitutional 
lawyers. To wit, since it is estab- 
lished that on the planet Glauben 
the species rattus norvegicus has 
thus far acclimated itself nicely 
and has not caused the type of 
ecodisaster which the Ecology 
Convention is designed, by pre- 
vention and — I stress — non- 
retroactive measures to forestall 
hut — I stress — not to after-stall; 
therefore, it appears, the full 
force of the legislation may be 
said to be in a state of suspension 
or lapse.” 

The Chairman nodded his vis- 
ored helmet. 

(If you didn’t understand the 
Minister, he said, in effect; “We’d 
like to help you. Chairman, and 
so let’s just say that the law isn’t 
applicable to your case.”) 

The Chairman nodded and re- 
plied: “We claim more than that, 
esteemed Excellency. We do not 
recognize the classification rattus 
norvegicus. No certainty exists 
that the animal we call rodentus 
glaubenicii amoris is an import.

ful planet composing love letters

words to characterize them, but

permit me to read to you a 
sample — ” 

The Minister interrupted has- 
tily. “That won’t be necessary, 
Mr. Chairman. In fact, our own 
technical people have emerged 
with conclusions very much like 
yours. And in this connection, let 
me say that Eastern Quadrant’s 
Quadrennial Economic Report 
outshines that of all other sectors 
thanks largely to the productivity 
of your planet. Such economic 
prowess, Mr. Chairman, is com- 
pletely inconsistent with violations 
of law. We can only infer that our 
agent has made a mistake. Both 
the House and Lords have ap- 
proved by nearly unanimous vote 
amendments to the Eco- 
Convention, and the document 
lies here before me for 
signature — ’’ 

Thump, thump, thump went 
the heavy glove of the faceless ex- 
ecutive on the polished surface of 
the table. 

“Minister,” he cried in a loud, 
hollow voice, “surely you know 
Section 209 of the Eco- 
Convention which expressly for- 
bids regional amendments? As the 
representative of the Southwest- 
ern Ratcatchers’ Association, I re- 
gretfully bring this to your 
attention — not because it will 
benefit the SRA, mind you: it’ll 
wipe us out! But because my con- 
stituents are men of law and 
honor, and we cannot allow you 
to make a serious error. Therefore 



I respectfully request that you 
submit the bill unsigned to Sys- 
tem Central for ratification.” 

An uproar of voices. 

“Your Excellency, I protest — ” 
“Who is this clown?” 

“What’s in that suit?” 

“I’ve never heard of the SRA.” 
“Sir, we’ll check this, this 
gentleman’s credentials this 
instant.” 

This last was said by Big Man 
himself who rose and gestured, 
pale of face and sweatbeaded with 
bureaucratic agonies. 

But before the armed atten- 
dants could make a move, the 
faceless Glauben executive sud- 
denly rose and disappeared 
through a panel of wall where 
none of the GE’s until then had 
suspected a door. He moved with 
the speed and resolution of some- 
one with a souped-up body. 
Guards bounced against the 
panel, but it had been locked 
again from the other side. 

The Glauben executive knew his 
way about the building and he 
went straight to a lower floor 
where Big Man’s offices were lo- 
cated, thinking, rightly, that no 
one would seek him there. He 
shuffled into the reception area 
and looked through his face-plate 
at a charmingly juttable fern be- 
hind a desk. 

“Excuse me. Miss,” he said, 
“are you the secretary of Borislav 
Hit’s supervisor?” 



44 



GALAXY 




The girl nodded with shy 
lushes. 

“I’ve come to make a complaint 
about that swine. Hit is the most 
K'pulsive, insensitive, vicious 
rascal I’ve ever run into. Let me 
Icll you—’’ 

‘Sir, ” the girl cried, and her 
diy eyes flashed a kind of fire. 
I’m only a secretary around here, 
hut I can tell you my opinion of 
Borislav Hit — ^he’s the finest, most 
lompetent, kindest, fairest, 
Nweetest man who ever. ...” 

Her eyes filled with tears, and 
she looked down. 

“Well,” cried the Blauben ex- 
rcutive, and now there was a 
riirious catch in his voice. “Well, 
well. ...” 

But when the girl looked up, 
the executive was gone. 

IV 

Gather around closer, young- 
sters, and let me conclude my 
lule. Let me skip over Borislav’s 
escape from the ministerial tower 
iiiid the planet, and let me say 
merely that Pappacappolus had 
underground tunnels for transpor- 
tation, water, waste, and so forth, 
and in a pinch Borislav didn’t 
mind swimming through sewage, 
especially not in a gravity suit. 
And let me say further that he 
had many friends in STAC, peo- 
ple who had little love for Big 
Man or his excellent superiors. 



and so Borislav was conveyed 
back to Glauben in a Black Mar- 
ket sort of way, incognito, as it 
were. On the way Big Man called 
him on the communicator built 
into Noball’s head, and Borislav 
swore the most solemn oaths that 
he was on Glauben that very 
moment. He described the land- 
scape to Big Man in the minutest 
detail — while actually staring out 
over the spiraling luminosity that 
space assumed through the port 
holes of a TC jumper. Big Man 
didn’t believe my granddad, but 
he didn’t press him very hard 
either. Big Man had scored a 
triumph of sorts and his mood was 
elated. Also, Borislav was danger- 
ous in his erratic way. Any man 
who’d do this, by God, might go 
all the way to System Central. 
You had to treat him with a pinch 
of caution. No use driving the 
man up a tree. 

Furthermore, let me skip over 
the conclusion of that conference 
in the ministerial auditorium with 
its gorgeous view of Computer’s 
Temple in Printout Plain — except 
to say this much; The faceless ex- 
ecutive truly rattled the Minister’s 
cage, in a manner of speaking, 
and the leaders of House and 
Lords began to grow nervous, and 
the Chairman of the Concession 
also felt a twinge of fear. They 
huddled in a tighter circle and 
nervously sucked coffee and tea, 
the Guru drinker having de- 
parted. Here was a dilemna,' and 



THE POLITICS OF RATTICIDE

they solved it like this: The 
amendment had to go, clearly. 
Now that a threat had been 
sounded, the Eco-Convention had 
to be respected. But how? How 
do that and yet protect the trade 
whose profits made EQ’s Quad- 
rennial Economic Report such a 
shiner? They talked at length, 
weighing options, each as dreary 
as the next. At last Big Man had a 
brilliant idea. “Why don’t we 
study the problem in greater 
depth, ” he suggested, and at his 
words a great excitement trem- 
bled through the people. A crea- 
tive suggestion finally! Study the 
problem, indeed! Determine all 
the unknowns. Yessir! “Al- 
phonse,” said Minister East, 
“that’s a darn good suggestion.” 
‘Alphonse,’ the Minister had said, 
using Big Man’s first name- 
— certainty of a promotion to De- 
puty Assistant Underminister at 
least. Big Man relaxed and ex- 
panded his chest. The Chairman 
agreed. Superb idea. Su-perb! In 
the meantime, of course, business 
had to go on as usual. How could 
you study the problem if the 
problem had been solved, right? 
Right, everyone said. 

And so an official order went 
out calling off TF-STAC. It ar- 
rived, in writing, the same day 
Borislav landed on Glauben and 
resumed his duties in the quonset 
hut. His secretary had failed him. 
For reasons unfathomable in an 
organization as efficient as the 



Special Technical Assistance 
Corps, she had overlooked his 
order, and the killing had con- 
tinued. In fact, when Boris walked 
over to Ratticide Central, he saw 
that the red bars on the graphs 
had almost caught up with the 
black. But now, official orders in 
hand, he had to call off the opera- 
tion. There was no alternative. 
Borislav was a member of STAC. 
He obeyed. He didn’t keep score. 

He sat down before the central 
communicator and activated the 
All Channels button. 

“All Points, ” he said to the de- 
vice. “All Points, this is Borislav 
Hit, Planetary Agent in Charge. 
We have orders to terminate the 
termination immediately. You will 
stop operations in an hour and re- 
turn to home base.” 

One junior colonel in the 
Southwestern district radioed 
back in astonishment. 

“How can you order that, PAC? 
We still have several million to 
gO;_” 

“Never mind, ” Borislav ans- 
wered. “The rest w ill d ie of 
grief.” 

He didn’t keep score, but he 
was sad. He asked his pilot to 
drop him off on the outskirts of 
Cosmopplis, and from there, left 
alone, he walked through the city 
engaged in a muttering conversa- 
tion with Noball. He circled the 
neighborhood where people now 
lamented in ratless grief behind 
the wire fence. He circled by the 



46 



GALAXY 



ocean where surf had wiped out 
the last tracks of norvegicus. He 
gazed out over the wine-red sea 
to the bell buoy in the distance 
nnd listened to its mournful clang. 
Then he checked in again at the 
Grand Hotel and asked for his old 
room back, eager to be alone with 
the thoughts he’d sent to Ita Gitta 
from that narrow table. That night 
the chamber maid came in. She 
recognized and reported him 
uf^ain. And thus it was that Con- 
cession found PAC for the cere- 
monial farewell dinner they had 
staged. 

It was a gala affair, and Borislav 
put a cheerful face on it. He even 
tried a toast or two after a few 
bottles of the local wine had 
thoroughly confused Noball’s 
head. He lurched and staggered 
ut the podium and made some- 
thing of an ass of himself, his 
heard all beaded with wine. At 
the end, when the Chairman gave 
him an unusually large and beaut- 
iful aphrodisiac fleece, carefully 
sealed into a plastic cover, he for- 
got to shake the Chairman’s hand 
and just careened out of the hall 
to the half-derisive applause of 
the Concessionaires. 

The next morning, however, 
aboard the shuttle, just before 
departure for the SSS Bod Boat to 
pick up Quantromer again, Boris- 
lav cracked the seal on his 
farewell present and got such a 
whiff of aphro-scent he quickly 
sealed the thing again. “Ho, boy!’’ 



he whispered to Noball. “If I ever 
get the three of us together — me, 
Ita, and this rug! Ho, boy, Noball. 
That’ll be something. ” 

Let’s skip the trip and see 
Borislav as he stood, once more, 
on the edge of the simublood 
pool. He had undressed Noball to 
his incomplete nakesness, had at- 
tached a weight to his leg. Now 
the two of them stood and waited 
for a signal from the man behind 
the glass to show that the 
psychomagnet was ready and 
operational. At last the attendant 
signaled, and Borislav turned to 
Noball, in a manner of speaking. 

“Good-bye, old friend, ” he 
said, in a voice that was now en- 
tirely his own yet still a vibration 
in Noball’s throat — ^and in a voice 
that had a cargo of feeling. 
“Good-bye, old buddy. You’re not 
a bad sort. Maybe we ll meet 
again. But tell those bio-boys to 
make you a better tummy, hear?’’ 

Then he jumped in. 

One last time the Taler touched 
his pipe and let smoke curl up 
into the air. One final time Millu- 
sion burned in the braincells of 
the teenies gathered around him 
in the B-Deck Whybar of the 
Time Ark bound for New Fron- 
tier. Once more the Taler re- 
sumed his yarn. 

Now we’re back on Pappa, 
children. Borislav’s arrival coin- 
cided with the sunset, and the 
chalk mountains were red, the

47 




ocean purple. He muttered his 
way through sterilization. “Just 
don’t put on any airs, Quantromer 
Hit,” he said to his body. “You’ve 
had it nice, friend. Poor Noball, 
now, he vvjent through all sorts of 
hell with me, he did. So you just 
keep still, will you. Don’t tell me 
how ‘deprived’ you are. All will 
be well, I think. How can she re- 
sist that smell, now? That’s what 
I’d ask you.” 

And Borislav made for a bank of 
telbooths and picked himself one. 
Quantromer’s fingers trembled 
over the digits, but to Borislav’s 
great joy and relief, Ita Gitta 
came on the screen. She dropped 
her lashes when he said hello. 

“You’re back,” she murmured. 

“Did you get my letters?” 

“Yes,” she murmured. Her 
eyes were wary. 

“Ita,” he said, “I’ve got to see 
you, even if it’s only for five mi- 
nutes.” He fingered the plastic of 
his aphro-pelt, just retrieved from 
Customs five seconds ago. But he 
kept it out of her view, below the 
screen. 

“Boris,” she said, “you wouldn’t 
have any ideas, now, would you?” 

“None, dearest,” he swore with 
feeling. “None whatever. I just 
want to say hello; you know, a 
handshake.” 

“Fine,” she said; her voice 
trembled a little. “A handshake.” 

“Be right over,” he husked into 
the screen, and he ran off in such 
haste that he forgot to sign off. 

48 



Ita Gitta lived in a tower in the 
foothills of the mountains, and the 
trip to her place took far longer 
from Borislav’s perspective than 
the forty minutes it actually con- 
sumed. 

They drove up a snaking road 
lined with willows weeping, up 
toward the fine blue residential 
tower where she had an apart- 
ment on level twenty-six. He 
threw money at the driver. He 
raced into the lobby and through 
it to the elevators. He fidgeted in 
the lift itself, which wouldn’t 
move fast enough for him. He 
burst out even before the sliding 
doors had completely slid apart. 
He bounded down the carpeted 
hall. 

But just before the door of her 
apartment, he suddenly stopped. 
With a sly grin beneath his bushy 
red beard, he carefully opened 
the plastic seal on his aphro-rug 
and — 

And he was shattered with dis- 
appointment. 

Now to understand his disap- 
pointment, you must go back in 
my story to that spot where I lec- 
tured on the Ecology Convention. 
You’ll recall what I said to you. If 
you’ve ever landed on a planet, 
you go through one hellish purifi- 
cation. They bathe you, they 
squirt you, they irradiate you- 
— that is how I put it, I believe, 
Every cell of your body is 
purified. The flora of your 
stomach must yield to the flora of 

GALAXY 




their stomach. I told you how 
they probe beneath your nails and 
massage your every hair with 
electronic fingers. Well, needless 
to say, they do the same with 
your belongings, and Pappa Cus- 
toms had dealt with Borislav’s jut- 
ting rug so thoroughly that the 
red root fungus that, interacting 
with rat epidermis, creates the 
aphrodisiac effect had been com- 
pletely and totally eradicated, and 
the smell that now arose from the 
sack was that of musty rat skin. 

Then as now, real aphro-fleece 
was difficult to come by. They 
were smuggled in, as a rule, or 
they came in through the hands of 
bribed Customs officials. And the 
real thing gave a kind of glamour 
to the pelts whose effectiveness 
was destroyed in transit or by 
time. But Borislav didn’t know 
about such things, and he had 
been neatly finessed by the very 
Convention he strove to enforce 
with such ingenuity. 

Well, you can imagine his dis- 
may. Quantromer shrunk several 
centies. The sly, smiling face fell 
in and turned into a long, sad 
frown. But at last Boris pulled 
himself together. He was an agent 
of STAC, and agents of STAC 
picked themselves up. He rang 
the bell. 

Almost at once the door flew 
open, and Ita Gitta’s warm, soft 
arms embraced his neck (?), Ita 
Gitta’s hot sweet lips sought 
his(!l), Ita Gitta’s magnificent tit- 

THE POLITICS OF RATTICIDE 



ties pressed against Quantromer’s 
chest(!?), and her eyes bathed his 
beard with beads of tears, and her 
voice husked with longing and af- 
fection, and in short, broken 
phrases she said, more or less, 
that she loved him, that she loved 
him more than anyone else in the 
Cosmos. .such letters. .such 
poetry. 

When she pulled him into the 
apartment, Borislav let the jutt- 
ting rug drop from his grasp. It 
lay outside on the thick carpet of 
the hall while inside, unaided by 
rat or fungus, my forebears did 
what they would do many times 
in a long and very fruitful mar- 
riage. 

And so ends my story. Any 
questions? 

Rubeema said: “Taler, what is 
xenopsylla cheopis and what is the 
rickettsia typhi that it carries?’’ 
The Taler answered: “I knew 
you’d catch me on an omission, 
Rubeema, you always do. Little 
xeno is a rat flea, and ricky-tippi 
is murine typhus fever, a disease. 
But to that the Glauben people 
had become immune. Next?” 
Francisco asked: “Taler, what- 
ever happened to that study Big 
Man suggested they carry out?” 
The Taler said: “It is still un- 
derway. Next?” 

Rubeema asked: “Taler, what is 
the moral of this story?” 

The Taler answered: “Moral? 
Children, I’m a Taler; I tell 
stories. Who am I to moralize?” ir

JERRY POURNELLE, Ph.D. 

ABM, MISSILE EATING LASERS 
AND A BI-POLAR WORLD 



The topics for these columns 
come from discussions between 
Editor Jim Baen and myself. This 
one is at .his request — but the 
opinions in it are mine. Jim 
shouldn’t be held responsible for 
my views, only for believing the 
subject important. 

When I first began work in 
aerospace I was part of a group 
known as Human Factors and Re- 
liability, and it says a lot about 
the status of both fields that they 
were lumped into one rather 
small outfit under a single super- 
visor. Now both are pretty big 
stuff in both aerospace and other 
industries, but in those days they 
were an afterthought. 

It turned out to affect my whole 
career, though. Although my 
primary work was in the human 
factors laboratories (I have proba- 
bly cooked more people than any- 



one not a cannibal by profession) 
there was always reliability work 
to be done, and 1 had that 
reliability-engineering background 
on my record. 

One route into “systems en- 
gineering” used to be through re- 
liability. (Two others were physics 
and economics; it was thought 
that physicists and economists 
were uniquely qualified to look at 
the “big picture”.) Consequently, 
when I moved up the aerospace 
ladder I ended up in systems de- 
sign work, and that took me over 
into “requirements.” 

The requirements game is a 
tough one. The theory is that one 
analyses what tasks ought to be 
performed, and comes up with 
concepts for systems to perform 
them. The real design engineers 
work on these, and if they’re 
lucky they sell the idea to a cus- 



50 





tomer. In aerospace the customer 
was generally the US Govern- 
ment, particularly the Air Force 
or NASA. 

Requirements analysis can’t be 
done in a vacuum. The analysts 
must know what’s p)ossible within 
the time span of their forecasts. 
It’s no good saying “we need a 
system to deliver a million metric 
tons across fifteen astronomical 
units at cost of no more than $100 
a ton. IOC (Initial Operating 
Capability) should be no later 
than^five years from date.” 

We might need such a system, 
but anybody turning in that kind 
of report would find himself with 
a mandatory appointment at Cen- 
tral Medical. On the other hand, 
a proper requirements should 
take account of realistic expecta- 
tions in technology. It’s perfectly 
permissible to do a system pre- 
design assuming that certain areas 
of research are going to pay off. 

In fact, if the funding agencies 
buy the requirement analysis, 
they may well put more money 
into the necessary research — so 
long as you can convince them 
there’s a good chance the desired 
capability will exist when needed. 

This is a very complex subject 
and I wouldn’t go into it if it 
weren’t a requirement for this 
column. However, any discussion 
of Anti-ICBM (ABM) systems is a 
kind of requirements analysis. Be- 
sides, it provides a good back- 
ground incident. 



Requirements teams generally 
get the best information on pres- 
ent and expected capabilities of 
exotic systems, and ours was no 
exception. Naturally the space 
systems requirements group was 
vitally interested in lasers as early 
as the late fifties. About 1960 we 
received a briefing from engineers 
who had given lasers a great deal 
of thought. 

Their conclusion was that lasers 
were interesting for communica- 
tions, and had a potential for 
rangefinding and the like, but 
their utility for aircraft and 
spacecraft interception would be 
nil. They argued from efficiency. 

Lasers in 1960 were much less 
than 1% efficient. Any airplane- 
eating laser would necessarily use 
a great deal of power, 99% of 
which would stay within the laser. 

We can’t possibly dissipate that 
much energy, and even if you 
make a fantastic assumption and 
plan on lasers an order of mag- 
nitude better, you still can’t do it; 
and besides, efficiencies an order 
of magnitude better just aren’t in 
the cards. 

That was 1960. I am told that as 
of September 1974 the airplane- 
eating laser was declassified. 
Since I’ve no clearance and 
haven’t had one for some time, 
I’ve no idea how long they’ve ex- 
isted, but it must have been for a 
while. It seems that our 
estimates — which were the very 
best obtainable in 1960 — ^vvere not 



51 




only wrong, but drastically so. In 
something less than 14 years the 
impossible was invented, and it 
changes the whole strategic envi- 
ronment. 

The story is told that when 
John F. Kennedy first took office 
as President, he asked the Com- 
mander in Chief of the Strategic 
Air Command (CINC-SAC; I 
apologize for the alphabet soup, 
but it’s obvious why so many ini- 
tials are used in this business) to 
review the battle plan in case 
there were war. 

He was given a review of the 
Single Integrated Operational 
Plan (Slop), in which each com- 
ponent of the strategic force had a 
definite mission. Some were to at- 
tack interceptor bases in order to 
allow others to get through. Tan- 
kers rendezvoused with bombers 
in many unlikely places. The sub 
marines launched their birds. The 
whole force went as soon as the 
order was given, and the result 
was destruction of the potential 
enemy. 

Kennedy was horrified. “Gen- 
eral,” he is supposed to have said, 
“you don’t have a war plan, all 
you have is a kind of horrible 
spasm.” One of the first tasks 
given Secretary of Defense (Sec- 
Def) McNamara was revision of 
the SIOPs to give the President 
“strategic options”. The new doc- 
trine was to be called “controlled 
response,” and the big buzz 

52 



words in those days were “flexibil- 
ity” and “flexible response.” 

It didn’t work. Although the 
name has been changed, our 
strategic war plan to this day is no 
more than a “horrible spasm”. 
Today our strategic doctrine is 
called “Mutual Assured Destruc- 
tion” (MAD) and mad is what some 
analysts think best describes it. 
The idea is that we kill them and 
they kill us and since each knows 
the other can do it, nobody will 
start the Big One in the first 
place. 

Given the MAD doctrine, the 
primary requirement of US 
strategic forces is “Assured De- 
struction” (AD); the capability to 
absorb the enemy’s best attack 
and launch sufficient weapons to 
penetrate his defenses and assure 
the destruction of the potential 
enemy to some unacceptable (to 
him) level. 

Now that level may have to be 
quite high. The Soviet Union, as 
an example, took some 30% 
casualties in WW II and survived; 
and strict Marxist doctrine says 
that no level of casualties is too 
high if the outcome of the war is 
the destruction of the bourgeois 
societies and the final victory of 
socialism. It’s no good saying that 
no sane man would really believe 
that, either, because some pretty 
influential people over there have 
come out and said it. 

The requirement then is for an 
AD force that can survive and 

GALAXY 




perform its mission. (“Perform its 
mission” is euphemistic for “kill 
most of the enemy’s civilian popu- 
lation and certainly cripple his 
leadership, military capability, 
and industry”.) It can do this in 
several ways. One is to have suffi- 
cient defenses for our weapons- 
systems (not for our people) to as- 
sure the temporary survival of the 
AD force. Another is to have an 
AD force so large that it can’t 
possibly be successfully attacked. 

A final method is to launch the 
AD force as soon as you’re sure 
you’re being attacked. This is by 
far the cheapest way to fulfill the 
requirement — so long as you’re 
not at war. It’s pretty expensive if 
you’ve saved money on weapons 
and then couldn’t afford to wait 
and see who launched what at 
you, and what it might do to you. 

I know of almost no one who 
likes the “launch on early warn- 
ing” solution, although there are 
economizers who seem deter- 
mined to force us into that no- 
option position. If we reject this 
position, there remain prolifera- 
tion of offensive systems; con- 
struction of defensive systems; or 
a mix of the two. 

Proliferation of offensive sys- 
tems is generally called “overkill”, 
and isn’t terribly popular. Now if 
you buy any part of the deter- 
rence argument, there has to be 
some on-going improvement of 
the offensive capabilities in order 
to match threat requirements; not 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



only must the AD force be able to 
survive and penetrate, but all po- 
tential enemies must believe it 
can do that. This is the usual ar- 
gument advanced for the “triad ” 
concept of missile subs, land- 
based missiles, and manned air- 
craft. 

The triad is supposed to make 
our AD capability credible. 
Something is bound to get 
through, or so the argument goes. 
At bottom it’s offensive system 
proliferation, which is demanded 
by the AD requirement, which is 
a direct consequence of the MAD 
doctrine. Naturally it results in 
“overkill” in that the force before 
losses must be many times more 
capable than the minimum that 
has to get through to perform the 
AD mission. 

The alternative is defense. Cri- 
tics of ABM generally have two 
arguments: (1), it won’t work, and 
we ll have wasted a great deal of 
money for nothing. This school 
includes not only those who don’t 
like any form of defense spending 
but also a number of Air Force 
generals — who’d rather put the 
money into more missiles and air- 
planes. It also includes some 
strategists who say “nobody ever 
won a war with defensive sys- 
tems.” 

The other anti-ABM argument 
is that it will work. If it does, 
they say, we won’t have a MAD 
situation *at all. The potential 
enemy won’t hold the US popula- 



53 




tion as hostages. He will therefore 
have two choices: either start the 
war at a favorable opportunity 
without warning, hoping to smash 
our AD before it can be launched, 
or, more likely, start R&D efforts 
to develop systems that can defeat 
our defenses. 

His R&D efforts are, it is said, 
bound to succeed. Modern 
weapons are so destructive that it 
doesn’t take many getting through 
to kill everyone off. Therefore, 
when it’s all finished, we’ll have a 
useless ABM system, the enemy 
will have new offensive weapons, 
and both of us will have spent a 
very great deal of money for no- 
thing. 

The ABM, it is said, will at best 
“trigger a new round in the arms 
race.” It will absorb funds we 
need for better things. Oddly 
enough, critics of ABM generally 
have their own ideas of what we 
should do with the money “saved” 
by not building ABM, and I know 
of none of those who wants that 
money left in the pockets of the 
taxpayers. Thus the strategic ar- 
gument generally gets compli- 
cated by debates about the social 
desirability of various schemes of 
national self-improvement, and 
those who favor ABM are often 
accused of ignoring vital problems 
which should “come first.” 

In addition to the above posi- 
tions, all of which more or less 
accept the MAD doctrine to some 
degree, there are those who re- 



ject MAD and want to see an en- 
tirely new strategic concept gov- 
ern force requirements. The most 
obvious of these is pacifism in one 
or another form. While 
philosophically respectable, and in 
my observation fairly popular 
among science fiction fans, 
pacifism will get no discussion 
here because at the moment it’s 
simply not a realistic alternative. 
The American people don’t buy 
it, and the liklihood of a pacifist 
Congress in the near future is 
vanishingly small. 

Another position was “assured 
survival”, which I didn’t invent, 
but I will claim credit for naming. 
It’s discussed at some length in a 
volume by S. T. Possony and J. 
E. Pournelle; the strategy 
OF TECHNOLOGY, New York, 
Dunellen, 1970. The idea was 
that our goal ought to be not the 
destruction of the potential enemy 
but the survival of the United 
States, and it accepts deterrence 
only as a temporarily necessary 
evil. 

There are two main arguments 
for assured survival as a goal. The 
first is obvious: it’s common 
sense. The second is moral: the 
Judeo-Christian concept of Just 
War does not include the killing 
of harmless civilians, certainly not 
as the primary military objective. 

The AS doctrine, then, gener- 
ates a difierent force requirement 
from MAD. Emphasis would be 
placed on defensive systems to 



54 



GALAXY 




protect not only weapons, but 
people; and offensive systems 
would be tailored for use against 
military targets for destruction of 
the enemy’s war capability. 

There were two main argu- 
ments against AS in my day. The 
first was technical: you can’t do it. 

The second was moral- 
philosophical: you don’t want to 
do it if you can, because AS as- 
sumes there can be nuclear wars, 
and if there can be there will be. 
Furthermore, the argument goes, 
by removing the US population 
from its status as hostages, we 
create the possibility that the US 
will start the war; the enemy 
knows this, and thus he is temp- 
ted to start it at any favorable op- 
portunity. 

That argument can be and was 
carried to the extreme of saying 
that any attempt to build fall-out 
shelters in the United States 
was/is an aggressive act against 
the Soviet Union. (For some 
reason those making that argu- 
ment never comment on the 
mandatory civil defense training 
every Soviet citizen undergoes, or 
the extensive shelter program in 
the USSR.) 

Finally, it was/is said, AS will 
again trigger another round in the 
arms race, so that at the end we’ll 
be no better off than we were, 
we’ll have spent a lot of money, 
and both sides will have more 
weapons — all to no benefit.

I hope the above is a fair sum- 
mary of strategic debate as it was 
prior to September, 1974. 

In my judgment, the missile- 
eating laser has changed the 
strategic environment considera- 
bly, and should “trigger a new 
round’’ in the arms debate. 

From a technical view the laser 
is an ideal ABM. One of the big 
problems with ABM systems was 
that you had not only to locate an 
incoming ICBM, but track it, 
guide an interceptor to it, and de- 
tonate a weapon to kill it. Track- 
ing is horribly difficult, decoys 
can exhaust the supply of inter- 
ceptors, and the defensive 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



55 



weapon so contaminates the de- 
fense environment that you have 
trouble seeing through your own 
weapton effects to get at the next 
bogie. 

With lasers none of this applies. 
The ability to detect is the ability 
to kill, since the lethality travels 
at lightspeed. Also, the laser is 
not a one-shot weapon, and thus 
we need not be so concerned with 
discriminating between decoys 
and the real thing. Also they can 
slew rapidly to cover a large area. 
(The laser itself doesn’t point, of 
course; a mirror does all that.) 

Thus, at least in theory, much 
of the technical argument against 
Assured Survival vanishes if laser 
ABM’s are feasible. What of the 
moral-philosophical objection? 

First, assume it’s all true, and 
that having spent the money to 
develop a laser ABM we find that 
the enemy has come up with an 
ICBM system that can penetrate 
it; we’re back to MAD. Have we 
gained nothing? 

We’ve gained a great deal. First 
and foremost, at the end of that 
round of the arms race there will 
be only one potential enemy. The 
Soviets may be able to develop 
penetrators, but no one else will. 
[Italics mine. — Ed.] Soviet 
aircraft and ICBM’s may be a 
threat, and we may be in a MAD 
situation vis-a-vis the USSR, but 
we’ll be hostage to no one else. 

That may be worth quite a lot; 

56 



there are nations far more reck- 
less than the Soviet Union and in 
a few years many of them will 
have both nuclear weapons and 
primitive delivery systems. At the 
moment we have exactly zero 
capability to protect ourselves 
from any ICBM, no matter how 
primitive. 

It may be worth something to 
our friends, too. With a good 
ABM system we may not be able 
to protect ourselves and allies 
from the Soviets, but we can pro- 
vide assurance against other milit- 
ary adventurers. After all, the 
US-Soviet detente, no matter how 
real, will not end international 
conflict. 

The effects of a not-incredible 
defense reach far beyond the cur- 
rently popular strategic issues. In 
my day we had a number of stan- 
dard strategic problems, each 
identified with a self-explanatory 
name. 

They included; The Mad Dic- 
tator with a Missile; the N-th 
Country Problem; Catalytic War 
(in which a third party attempts to 
trigger war between the US and 
the Soviet Union); The Crazy 
General Launching Two Birds; 
etc., etc. 

All of these are, if not solved, 
at least affected by a strategy of 
Assured Survival based on laser 
ABM systems. If the crazy gen- 
eral launches a bird, it can be 
shot down; we won’t have to 
worry about this being the initial 

GALAXY 




shot of a pin-down attack. Pin- 
down, incidentally, is no joke: it’s 
an attack that uses a few weapons 
detonated at intervals over the 
enemy’s (or our own) missile 
farms to keep the birds from ris- 
ing until a massive attack can ar- 
rive and kill them in their holes. 
With many warheads per missile, 
if we see one bird coming in we 
can’t be sure it’s not the first 
stage of pindown. 

Incidentally, the Catalytic War 
problem may be more real than 
you might think. A few years ago 
a fanatic faction within a nation al- 
lied with the US actually plotted 
to trigger a US-SU war. The con- 
spirators were caught by their 
own intelligence agencies. They 
included some pretty influential 
people. 

So there are some real benefits 
to an ABM system, even one that 
won’t stop the Soviets. Mutual US 
and SU deployment of such sys- 
tems would create a bi-polar 
world, which may or may not be 
preferable to a situation in which 
there are several, to dozens, of 
triggers that could start WW III. 

I think it would be. 

And beyond all that we’d have 
the lasers themselves! A rocket in- 
terceptor isn’t worth very much 
beyond its designed purpose, but 
a big laser is valuable. Among 
other things it could be the heart 
of the laser orbital-systems 
launcher I described last April 



(halfway to ANYWHERE; 
Galaxy, April, 1974). It could be 
the key to the planets. [Italics 
mine. — Ed.] 

Then too, a major component 
and large part of the expense of a 
laser system is power plants. 
These would be useful in 
peacetime since the lasers won’t 
need the power. I don’t think I 
need say a lot about the advan- 
tages of energy self-sufficiency. 

There are, in other words, a 
number of benefits to a laser- 
ABM system benefits that go far 
beyond the issues now debated. 
I’ll freely admit I’d like to see the 
lasers themselves developed in- 
depedently of the defense re- 
quirement. In my judgment the 
resulting cheap access to space 
would itself be worth the invest- 
ment. 

In fact, I think economical ac- 
cess to space will bring such a 
wealth of technological benefits 
that we’ll be able to afford many 
of the social programs now ad- 
vanced as preferable to defense 
spending — and I also think it un- 
likely that we’ll buy the needed 
research except as part of a de- 
fense package. 

I’ve given up believing myself 
infallible. Still, I’ve looked at the 
problem for a nuriiber of years, 
and my present analysis convinces 
me. I think we ought to adopt As- 
sured Survival as our goal; and 
that we should get to work on big 
missile-eating lasers. ★ 



A STEP FARTHER OUT

Ryan turned away from the 
window, looking down and turn- 
ing his glass so that the ice cubes 
spun. The house felt empty; the 
silence was not right. He knew 
that he should hear the soft 
sounds of his wife getting his 
daughter ready for bed. 

Ryan felt lonely, and went to 
the portable bar for another 
drink. The bar looked like an an- 
tique wooden globe when it was 
closed. Ryan had bought it in 
Spain, where he and May had 
gone on their honeymoon, the 
year before civilian passports were 
revoked. 

Annie walked in naked. 6 

“Annie,” Ryan said, gently re- 
proving. He set his glass down on 
the stereo and went to kneel be- 
side her. Her hair lay in moist 
curls around her head, and there 
were tiny droplets of water all 
over her body. The damp patch 
on the carpet where she stood 
began to spread. She turned her 
brilliant blue eyes, her mother’s 
eyes, on Ryan and said accus- 
ingly, “Mommy didn’t come dry 
me off.” 

Ryan smoothed her damp hair. 
Russet, he thought, auburn. The 
loveliest words for the loveliest 
color. It reminded him of au- 
tumn. He pressed his face against 
her head, but she smelled of 
Ivory soap and childhood, not of 
apples or leaves. 

She pulled away, putting her 
hands on her hips, and made a 



mouth at him, the way she had 
seen her mother do. “Daddy. It’s 
my bedtime.” 

“I’ll put you to bed, ” he said. 
“You shouldn’t run around naked, 
you know.” 

“Well, Mommy didn’t come. I 
was looked for her. ” 

“A child.” 

Ryan and Annie looked up to- 
gether. May stood in the door- 
way, her hair mussed, her face 
soft and slightly puffy, as if she 
had been asleep. 

“There’s a child, a little girl. 
Ryan?” 

No, he thought, belatedly. He 
wished he had not been drinking, 
or that he had drunk himself into 
insensibility. But there was 
Annie. 

“Annie, sweetheart — ” 

But she had run to her mother. 
“I waited and waited but you 
didn’t come.” 

“Ryan?” 

“Annie, sweetheart,” Ryan said. 
“Run to your room and put on 
your jammies. Mommy and I will 
be in to kiss you goodnight in a 
minute.” 

“Mommy, why didn’t you 
come dry me? Mommy? Why? 
Mommy?” Annie tugged at May’s 
full skirt. Ryan caught the note in 
her voice that presaged tears. 
Poor Annie. She knew. She could 
sense it. 

Dawning panic on May’s face as 
she bent to enfold Annie’s wet 
body to her. Her eyes did not 



59 




leave Ryan’s. “Oh, Ryan. This 
is — oh, Ryan — ” 

“Annie.” 

“Annie,” May murmured. She 
stood up, holding Annie, and bent 
her face into Annie’s neck. 
“Annie, Annie. Oh, Annie.” 

Annie threw her arms around 
her mother’s neck and buried her 
face against her. But she said no- 
thing. She was not reassurred. 

“I’ll take her to bed?” May 
asked. 

“At the end of the hall.” 

“Wait for me.” 

Ryan sank into the couch and 
stared at the Van Gogh print on 
the opposite wall. Crazy old Van 
Gogh. He had cut off his own ear. 
Ryan wondered what they had 
done to him after that. 

“Five years, Ryan. At least five 
years.” May came and sat beside 
him on the couch, taking his hand 
between hers. “How old is she? 
Of course we called her Annie, 
after my sister, right?” 

Ryan nodded wearily. 

“This has happened before, 
hasn’t it, Ryan? It’s happened be- 
fore? Has it? ” 

“Yes.” 

“But I don’t remember! I don’t! 
We were married, the two of us, 
together, here — ” she touched the 
couch and looked around. “Here, 
in this house. But no Annie, no 
children. Oh, Ryan, what does it 
mean? How could I lose — five 
years? Or more? How could it hap- 
pen? Why? What is it? ” 

60 



“You just forget things,” he 
said, very softly. 

“But why? Always? Will my 
memory come back? Why?” 

“The operation. It’s something 
to do with that.” 

She stared at him in a panic 
and snatched her hand from his. 
“What op — I don’t remember! 
What’s wrong with me — is this 
me?” Turning her face away from 
him, she began to cry. 

Ryan stood and went to the 
window where he stared out at 
the placid streets. The pools of 
light beneath each streetlamp 
were empty. The neighborhood 
was silent. People didn’t go out 
much after dark anymore, though 
the streets were safer than they 
had ever been. He turned back 
into the room. May had stopped 
crying. She had never been one 
for crying. 

She said, “When I was little my 
sister Annie told me that every 
seven years each cell in a person’s 
body has been replaced. I guess I 
was about five then. It really wor- 
ried me. She told me that every 
seven years you become a com- 
pletely new person. A different 
person. I used to be afraid. I 
thought that when I was seven I 
wouldn’t rememb.er the old me. I 
thought that if my brain cells 
were all replaced then, ” she 
turned her palms upward into the 
air, “poof go my memories.” 

“But by the time you were 
seven you had forgotten about it. 

GALAXY 




Until Annie reminded you.” 

“I’ve told you this before? ’’ 

Ryan nodded. 

“The last time I forgot? Is it 
like this every time? ” 

“Not exactly.” 

“How often? How long has this 
heen going on? Have we been to 
the doctor?” 

“More than one. There’s 
nothing. .nothing that can be 
done. It might be just an im- 
mediate reaction, and it should 
stop soon.” But her periods of 
amnesia had been increasing in 
frequency. 

“What operation was this?” 
May asked. 

“Government sponsored for a 
better future.” 

She glanced at him sharply. “A 
volunteer thing?” 

“Not in the least. People 
turned each other in — and then, 
of course, there were the crimi- 
nals, and tho.se on file as subver- 
sives.” 

“Of course. I was a subversive 
in college. A teenage radical. 
What did the operation do to 
me?” 

“Made you a better, happier 
citizen. The object was to remove 
your destructive tendencies and 
install something, a tracer device 
.so that if you should backslide, 
they could find you.” 

“Are you. ?” 

“No. There’s a new bill up, 
though, about ‘testing for subver- 
sive and criminal potentiality’ and 

CHANGELINGS 



if it passes, which it will. .” 

May stared at the floor. “I don’t 
remember. I could have been in 
fairyland for the past five years. 
Or what Annie told me about 
being made new, or — ” 

“Or you could be a change- 
ling.” 

She looked* up. “How did you 
know — ” 

“That was the story Annie 
wanted?” 

She nodded. “I told her no 
story tonight.” 

“But she never goes to sleep 
without a story.” 

“She was very good about it. 
Very quiet. She — I suppose she 
could feel there was something 
wrong, that I was different. I 
didn’t even know what drawer her 
pajamas were in. Oh, Ryan, can’t 
we do something? When will I be 
all right again?” 

Ryan shrugged, caught her look 
of need. “I’m sorry, but it varies. A 
few hours or a few days.” 

“Never any longer?” 

He shook his head. Last time it 
had been six days before her 
memory came back. The duration 
grew longer, and the time between 
occurances lessened. The first 
time she had been set back only 
to the time of the operation. 

“Can we call a doctor?” 

“I told you — ” 

“Oh, please, darling — just let’s 
call Ben. It will make me feel bet- 
ter to talk to him. He knows 
about me?” 

61 




Ryan nodded. ‘‘I’ll call him.” 

She leaned across the couch to 
hug him, and he pulled her to 
him, holding on tight. 

May went back into the bed- 
room while Ryan called Ben. “I’ll 
just lie down for awhile,” she 
said. 

Ben would come, of course. He 
was the family doctor and a long- 
time family friend. He promised 
to be by within an hour. 

Ryan went into the bedroom. It 
was dark, but the curtains were 
open, and there was some light 
from the street. He saw the gleam 
of May’s eyes. 

“I didn’t mean to disturb you,” 
he said. 

“I’m not sleepy. He’s coming?” 
“In about an hour.” 

“Oh?” 

“I told him it wasn’t an 
emergency. Really, darling, we 
can’t just break up his whole 
evening.” 

“I’m sorry.” 

“Don’t be silly.” 

He went to the dresser, to the 
box that held the cuff-links and 
tie-clips he never wore, relics of a 
time past. 

He took out a folded, brittle 
newspaper clipping and unfolded 
it by the window in a shaft of 
light from the streetlamp although 
he knew the picture well enough 
to look at it in the dark. 

It had been a front-page photo. 
May’s head was sandwiched bet- 
ween two others, leaning out of 



the window of an occupied build- 
ing. A banner proclaiming the 
building’s liberation stretched 
below them. Three arms thrust 
forward in jubilant fists. And 
May’s face, smiling, alive, 
victorious. .holy. 

“For this, ” he said softly. 

“Ryan? What are you — oh. I 
wish you’d throw that away. I 
don’t like it. ” He turned and saw 
that she had raised herself on her 
elbows. “That’s not me. It was a 
stupid, violent time that we grew 
up in. You had the sense 
then. .1 didn’t. I’m a different 
person now, though. I don’t know 
how I could have ever been like 
that. .1 can’t even remember 
what it felt like.” 

“Of course you can’t. ” He 
folded the paper and put it in his 
back pocket. 

“Ryan? Come here.” Her voice 
was shy. 

“Not now,” he said, as gently as 
he could, and left the room with- 
out touching her. 

He didn’t like the way the liv- 
ing room felt and knew the rest of 
the house would be no better. He 
felt like a deserter, but he went 
outside. He would walk for a few 
minutes. 

Outside was no better. It was 
quiet and the air felt thick and 
still. He could taste the smog. He 
began to walk, hoping he would 
see someone to speak to, but he 
saw no one. He headed up toward 



62 



GALAXY 




the highway, towards a diner he 
had occasionally stopped in for a 
cup of coffee. 

The diner, when he reached it, 
was empty except for the coun- 
terman, its emptiness made the 
more vivid by the merciless 
florescent lights shining down 
endlessly on all the hard, clean, 
bright surfaces. 

“Evening,” said the counterman 
cheerily. “What can I do for 
you?” 

Ryan straddled one of the high 
brown stools. “Just a Coke. 
Thanks.” 

“This is a slow time,” the coun- 
terman said. “Past the regular 
dinner hour, but not so late that 
other places are closed. You live 
nearby, don’t you? We don’t get 
many walking in — when I saw you 
didn’t have a car I knew you 
must be from nearby. There 
y’are — anything else?” 

“No thanks.” 

“Walk for your health?” 

“I just wanted some air.” 

“Nice night for walking, I 
guess. Real warm for this late in 
the season.” 

Ryan wished another customer 
would come in. The counterman’s 
persistant friendliness made him 
uncomfortable, and his physical 
appearance inspired dislike in 
Ryan: the shining head beneath 
thinning hair, the watery blue 
eyes, the horsey teeth beneath 
the stiff ginger mustache. .Ryan 
turned his attention to the voice 



from the radio which was playing 
at the end of the counter. It was a 
news broadcast, full of hopeful 
messages about the state of the 
union. There was less and less 
coverage given to the rest of the 
world these days — no one wanted 
to hear about wars or crime. 

The counterman seemed to fol- 
low Ryan’s attention. “Gives you 
hope, doesn’t it?” 

“What.” 

“The news. It’s all good now, or 
nearly. Just remember how it was 
ten years ago — or even five. Peo- 
ple didn’t go out on the streets 
— you wouldn’t have gone out for 
fresh air unless you were crazy. 
You would have been beaten up 
and robbed. Mugged. ” He said 
the word as if it were foreign and 
he wasn’t sure of the pronuncia- 
tion. 

“Thanks to the operation,” 
Ryan said. 

“That, and other things. The 
government finally cracking down 
on criminals. Democracy is great, 
but people have to deserve it. 
There were a lot of changes that 
had to be made.” 

“Did you have the operation?” 
Ryan asked. 

“Me? No. I’ve always been a 
good citizen. I’ve always done my 
duty.” The way the counterman 
looked at him made Ryan uneasy, 
and he had to caution himself 
against paranoia. The day May 
was. in the hospital he had gone 
around all day suspecting people

of spying on him, of being out to 
get him, of making accusations 
disguised as innocuous conversa- 
tion. 

Ryan realized that he was 
standing, fumbling in his pocket 
for change. 

“I’ve got to be going,” he said. 
“I didn’t tell my wife I was going 
out — she’ll worry — ” 

“But you didn’t drink your 
Coke.” 

“I guess I’m not thirsty.” He 
put a quarter on the counter. 

The counterman pushed it 
back. “I won’t charge you for it, 
then. Drink it myself.” He 
smiled. “Have a good walk. ” His 
“Come back again” was cut off by 
the closing of the heavy glass 
door. 

Headlights cut across Ryan’s 
face as he turned up his driveway, 
and he felt the familiar paranoid 
beating of his heart as he realized 
the car was turning into his 
driveway just behind him. 

“Ryan? Is anything wrong?” 

It was Ben. 

“No, no. I just stepped out for 
some air.” 

“Well, you stepped into the 
wrong place for it,” Ben said, get- 
ting out of his car. “Phew. It 
stinks tonight. Supposed to clear 
by tomorrow, though.” 

Ben was one year away from 
compulsory retirement. He’d cho- 
sen to continue working through 
the past two optional years. They 
went into the house together.

“May’s in the bedroom, rest- 
ing.” 

“Fine.” He scrutinized Ryan’s 
face. “You shouldn’t let this get to 
you, you know. I’m sure it’s only 
some preliminary adjustment. ” 
“Why don’t you go in and see 
her.” Ryan knew that Ben would 
catch the hard edge of dismissal 
in his voice, knew also that Ben 
would not be offended by it. 

“Sure, sure, ” Ben said. He put 
his hand on Ryan’s shoulder. 
“Take it easy.” 

Ryan sank into the couch, ig- 
noring the voices that came 
quietly from the other room. 

“She’ll sleep now,” Ben said 
when he came out of the bed- 
room. “Could I trouble you for a 
cup of coffee?” He followed Ryan 
into the kitchen. 

“What did you tell her?” 

“She just wanted to talk.” 

“She’s sleeping, you said?” 

“No, but it shouldn’t be long.” 
“Why didn’t you just turn her 
off?” 

“I wouldn’t do that, Ryan.” 
“Why not? You’re a doctor, you 
should know all about implants. I 
turned her off myself, once. Acci- 
dentally. I was frantic until I 
found the place again to turn her 
back on.” 

“The little death,” said the doc- 
tor. 

“No. More like turning off and 
turning on a doll. Ben, they’ve 
taken my wife away from me and 
given me a docile robot-

housekeeper. They destroyed her! 
Now she’s losing her past — ” 

“It’s nothing to worry about, 
Ryan. This whole business of the 
memory — it will pass, I promise 
you.’’ 

“How do you know? Maybe for 
some people — but when they’re 
tampering with minds — it could 
get worse. She’ll be nothing but a 
shell, without memories, and 
they’ll reprogram her into a 
model citizen — that’s what 
they — ’’ 

“Your voice, Ryan, lower your 
voice.” 

Ryan took a coffee cup and 
saucer out of the cupboard, his 
hands shaking. 

“How did we let this happen, 
Ben? How could we? It won’t 
stop. It was only the criminals at 
first — but they took my wife, my 
sweet, beautiful May just because 
she was on their bloody list.” 

“She wasn’t harmed, Ryan. 
You’re being overly dramatic. You 
must face up to the fact that May 
had certain. .tendencies and be- 
liefs that could be harmful.” 

“She never did anything! They 
forced her to have this op — ” 
‘Calm down, Ryan. If May had 
had an illness you would have 
wanted it operated on, 
removed — ” 

“The analogy doesn’t hold, 
doctor. May used to be interested 
and aggressive and very alive. She 
wanted to change things — she was 
a constructive person, not a de- 



structive one. You’ve seen the 
change — you can’t say it’s for the 
better. I can’t believe this is you, 
Ben, spouting — ” Ryan stopped, 
comprehension dawning. “You. 
You’ve had the operation, too. 
You have an implant like May, 
haven’t you, Ben?” 

“Yes. Yes, I have. But don’t 
you see — ” 

“Why you?” Ryan asked softly. 
“God knows you’ve never been a 
radical. What was your crime? 
Membership in the JDL?” 

“I was against the operations at 
first. I thought that they removed 
the will. Now I understand — ” 

“Of course. And now you’re a 
puppet as well.” 

“You’re being paranoid. There 
is no great ‘they’ corrupting 
us — we run our own lives.” 

“Oh, we let it happen, all right. 
We wanted to bum out the bad- 
ness in our criminals. Then in our 
potential criminals. Then in any- 
one who disagrees. Change their 
minds. Indoctrinate our children.” 
“Ryan, it’s all for the good.” 

“It always is. The good of the 
State. Well, goddamn the State!” 
“As your doctor and your friend 
I must advise you to stop this 
foolish talk. Get some sleep. Take 
a vacation. Don’t worry so much.” 
“That’s a great prescription. 
This country has gone to hell pre- 
cisely because we’ve closed our 
eyes. 

Ben turned away. “I’d better 
leave now.”

Ryan saw his own hand go out 
toward the back of Ben’s neck. 
His fingers found it, pressed, and 
he caught Ben before he could hit 
the floor. The implant was in the 
same place as May’s. 

“How convenient,” he mur- 
mured. He looked up from the 
sleeping Ben to see Annie stand- 
ing in the doorway in a long blue 
nightgown, her little bare feet 
curling on the lineoleum as she 
watched in silence. In a year she 
would have to go to kindergarten, 
and they would begin on her, 
feeding her drugs for docility and 
propaganda in the name of educa- 
tion. 

“Is Doctor Ben sick?” 

“Just sleeping, hon. Run back 
to bed now.” 

“Can’t sleep.” 

“Sure you can.” 

“No story,” she said, widening 
her eyes at him. A finger went to 
her mouth, and she chewed it 
thoughtfully, staring at him. 

“Run back to bed and Daddy 
will come tell you a story.” 

When she had gone he laid Ben 
down in some semblance of com- 
fort. He thought about going to 
Canada. He had thought about it 
before. Things weren’t much bet- 
ter up there, but in Canada and 
in the northwestern states like 
Washington and Oregon the un- 
derground was supposed to be 
strong. May had told him that, 
before the operation. They should 
have gotten out then, but when 



you’ve spent your whole life, as 
Ryan had, accepting and obeying, 
it was hard to give up everything 
and go. 

If he went now he would have 
to leave May. He couldn’t take 
her — the implant was part tracer 
and the police would have them 
back as soon as they were missed. 

He went back into the bed- 
room. 

“Darling? Has Ben gone?” 
“Yeah.” 

“I didn’t hear his car. I \yas lis- 
tening for it.” 

“You should be asleep.” 

“I know. Is Annie still up?” 
“Yes, she came out and saw 
Ben.” 

“Oh. I heard her — I didn’t hear 
any other voices — I don’t know, I 
thought she was playing with the 
phone. I must have been dozing. ” 
“Of course you were. Go back 
to sleep. The sooner you do, the 
sooner it will be morning.” 

She laughed. “Like Christmas. 
If I wait for Santa, he’ll never 
come. Ryan. .” 

He went to her, bent over, and 
kissed her. His hand went behind 
her neck and pressed, and her 
lips fell slack and asleep beneath 
his. 

He went into Annie’s room and 
helped her to dress, telling her 
that they were going for a ride. 
“But it’s late.” 

“Not for grown-up people. And 
you’re not asleep, anyway. You 
like to go for rides.” 



GALAXY 




“Yes,” she said doubtfully. 
“Will Mommy come?” 

“No. Mommy’s sleeping.” 

“Like Doctor Ben?” 

He looked down at her sharply. 
“You turned him off, didn’t 
you?” 

“What do you mean?” 

“You turned off Doctor Ben.” 
“What do you know about 
things like that? Where did you 
hear it?” 

“I just know.” Her eyes grew 
vague. She looked away. “Can I 
bring Raggedy Ann?” Ryan picked 
up the doll from the bedside 
table, where it slumped against 
the pink Princess telephone. 

The streets were eerily empty. 
Didn’t people go out anymore? 
Ryan turned on the radio in the 
car and settled into driving. 

“The President spoke to the na- 
tion this afternoon, expressing his 
gratitude to the people of the Un- 
ited States for making such a dras- 
tic drop in the crime rate possi- 
ble. Reminding his listeners that 
‘Eternal Vigilance is the price of 
freedom,’ Mr. — ” 

Ryan punched the key for 
another station and got some 
bouncy, innocuous music. 

“We learned that in school, ” 
Annie said suddenly. 

“What?” 

“Eternal vigilance.” 

“Annie, you don’t go to school.” 
“Ballet school. I do so.” 

“You learned that in ballet 
school?” 



“Miss Fontaine tells us lots of 
things.” 

“Not always about ballet, I take 
it.” He had convinced May that 
ballet lessons would be more use- 
ful to Annie than nursery school. 
There were no more safe places. 

“You shouldn’t have,” she said. 

“What?” She was as uncanny as 
her mother about reaching into 
his thoughts. 

“Done what you did to Doctor 
Ben. That’s against the law. And 
the things you said to him. They 
were wrong, too.” 

How long were you spying on 
us?” Fat, ugly spiders were crawl- 
ing up his spine. His sweat made 
him cold. He looked at her. She 
was leaning away from him, her 
face close to the window, fogging 
it with her breath and tracing 
lines with one finger. “Answer 
me!” Her left hand crept to her 
mouth at the sharpness in his 
voice. 

“It was against the law,” she 
whispered. 

“Annie — ” With an effort he 
gentled his voice, returned most 
of his attention to the road. They 
were on the freeway now, head- 
ing out of town, and there was 
some traffic. “Annie, you know 
your Daddy wouldn’t do anything 
wrong. Sometimes the laws are 
wrong, and people must change 
them.” 

“People change laws by voting. 
People who break laws are sick 
and they must be helped.” The

words were not hers; her voice 
was virtuous and intent. 

“Does Miss Fontaine tell you 
that, too?” 

"Nuh-uh. That’s Sargent Dare.” 

“Who’s Sargent Dare?” 

“You know. On TV.” 

“The TV doesn’t always tell you 
the truth, punkin. Life isn’t that 
simple. The 'TV is wrong some- 
times, but what your parents tell 
you — ” 

“Tell me a story. You said you 
would. Tell me the one about the 
changeling. ” 

“I don’t know that one.” 

“Yes you do. About how the 
fairies come and steal away the 
human baby and put a fairy child 
in its place — yes you do know it. 
Tell me.” 

“Not while I’m driving, 
sweetheart.” Glancing down at 
her he saw that she was near 
tears. She should have been 
asleep long ago, poor kid. “Look, 
why don’t you climb over into the 
back seat and lie down and go to 
sleep. 

“Story first.” 

“Youll have to give me time to 
think of one, then.” 

“Okay.” 

But all he could think of was 
May, how she had been before, 
and the way they had changed 
her. Annie began to speak then, 
and he pulled himself out of bit- 
terness to listen. 

“On Sargent Dare there was 
this show where this boy’s parents 



were very bad people. ” She was 
speaking to her Raggedy Ann 
doll, Ryan saw. She used that 
ploy often, dragging the doll into 
a room where her parents were 
occupied, and talking to it, mean- 
ing for them to hear as well. “They 
weren’t really bad people, 
but they were sick. They had bad 
thoughts and so they broke the 
law. They broke the law a whole 
lot, but nobody knew about it ex- 
cept their little boy. Then he 
learned in school about the law 
and so he called the police and 
told them. He remembered the 
number. 

“But don’t worry. Raggedy, 
they didn’t put his parents in jail. 
The police are our friends. They 
help us. They took his parents 
and did a little operation and 
made them happy. They came 
home and they smiled and they 
never broke the law again and 
they gave the little boy presents. 
And they all lived happily ever 
after. ” 

There 'vas a road block up 
ahead. A routine police check. 
One of the measures that wds rid- 
ding the country of crime. Ryan 
had been through a dozen of 
them at least. He slowed the car, 
his throat tight. 

He felt Annie sliding closer to 
him on the seat. She put her. 
hand on his arm. 

“We’ll live happily?” she asked. 
“Happily ever after? ” *

THE SIREN SONG 
OF ACADEME 

Lester del Rey 



Quite a while ago some idiot 
came up with the idea that sci- 
ence fiction is a ghetto. That ideas 
has now become a clieche that far 
too many accept. Some indeed 
seem to have accepted it so well 
that they have developed fears of 
pogroms to come and so have has- 
tened to convert to the True 
Faith of the infallible mainstream. 
Or perhaps they have only be- 
come maranos. All of which shows 
that science-fiction’s Chosen Peo- 
ple should never trust the goyim.* 
Two articles by writers from 
our field whom I always respect 
and often admire demonstrate 
how widespread the idea of a sci- 
ence fiction ghetto has become. 
Games Gunn began a guest 
editorial in Analog with that 
cliche; and Ursula K. LeQuin 
quickly got to it in her article for 



*For those who know little of Jewish his- 
tory, pogroms were reigns of terror against 
the people of the ghetto; maranos were 
those who claimed to convert, but secretly 
retained their previous faith; and goyim 
singular, goy) were the Nazarines outside 
the ghetto. 



the December Forum in Galaxy. 

Now Cliches are tricky things 
to use, even though I don’t neces- 
sarily object to such harmless 
ones as “cold as ice.” But they 
should always be re-examined by 
those who use them. Some, like 
“good a gold”, are neither true 
nor harmless; gold is not good as 
a general investment in today’s 
market — but those who automati- 
cally associate good with gold are 
flocking to lose their money on 
this unstable commodity. Cliches 
have a bad habit of being used as 
axioms — like the concept that the 
President is better than other 
men. There are a lot of people 
who still believe that, despite re- 
cent evidence to the contrary. 

All right, let’s examine just what a 
ghetto is. There’s a good deal of 
argument about the origin of the 
word among dictionary au- 
thorities; but it’s fairly obviously 
an Italian form (or respelling) of 
the Hebrew word g-f. (Hebrew 
uses a stem of consonants in 
which the vowels move around or 
change for shades of meaning.) A 



69 




git was the paper a man of Old 
Testament days used to 
divorce — or put away — his wife. A 
ghetto is a place where Jews were 
put away. They were forced to 
live there, away from contact with 
true believers,* and forbidden to 
be outside the ghetto after sun- 
down. They were put away, and 
they had no option but to stay 
there. A voluntary ghetto is a 
meaningless noise. 

Now just who put the writers, 
fans and general readers of sci- 
ence fictionaway? Who forbade 
them to associate freely with 
other readers and writers at any 
time? In what way were they 
banned, proscribed, segregated, 
cast out or put away? 

I can’t remember ever being 
kept from any kind of books or 
from libraries because I read sci- 
ence fiction. Nobody ever told me 
that I shouldn’t read the old avant 
garde Story magazine — or the 
books by Cervantes, Hugo, Kafka, 
or even Joyce and Pound. My col- 
lege literature professor didn’t 
frown when I brought Astounding 
Stories into class; in fact, it was he 
who told me about the Balmer 
and Wylie serial in Bluebook. 

And nobody else I’ve met 
among a rather large acquain- 
tanceship of writers and fans 
seemed to have been kept from 
reading outside the field of sci- 
ence fiction either. In fact, I find 
that the readers of science fiction 
are often far better read than 



most other people I meet 
— including many of the college 
teachers I have known. 

It’s true that I was sometimes 
asked why I read “that trash.” 
Curiously, the ones who asked 
were rarely among the people 
who read much better literature 
of any sort; the askers usually did 
so while buying their daily tabloid 
or their sports, detective or west- 
ern fiction. (Incidentally, I also 
read a lot of those pulps; there 
was no discrimination about sel- 
ling them to s-f readers.) 

How about a ghetto for science 
fiction writers, though? Sorry, I 
never discovered that there was 
one. I wrote science fiction — and 
still do — more than other types of 
stories simply because I liked 
writing it more. But the ability to 
write isn’t really divisible by 
categories, as all good editors 
know, whatever the self-termed 
critics may feel. I have usually re- 
served my real name for science 
fiction, but “Lester del Rey” was 
typed clearly on the first page of 
every manuscript regardless of 
byline — to make sure the check 
would come to me. So, whatever 
pen-name I used, my identity was 
never secret. Nobody rejected me 
because I wrote science fiction. 

Examples: some time during 
World War II I happened to think 
of an idea for a slick story about a 
romance between two older peo- 
ple. I sent it off and got a check 
for it. I hadn’t written a letter of 



70 



GALAXY 




self-introduction to the editor, but 
he enclosed a note to me with the 
check, asking whether I was the 
same del Rey who wrote science 
fiction? Apparently he was a fan. 

Much later, I sent a two-page 
outline for a historical adventure 
book to a major publisher for 
whom I’d never written. When 
they queried my agent about my 
writing experience, he simply 
cited some science fiction books. 
The editor didn’t read that type of 
literature — but she accepted my 
work in it as sufficient proof that I 
could write; as a result, I got a 
contract without the need of sam- 
ple chapters. Rather than a cause 
for being put away, my experi- 
ence in the field has been a 
means of being accepted generally 
as a writer. I’ve written damned 
near every type there is (except 
for the long defunct love-pulp 
type), both fiction and non-fiction, 
and I’ve never found any editor 
who wanted to put me in a 
ghetto. 

Even academic circles have 
never seemed desirous of exclud- 
ing science fiction writers. Quite a 
few from our ranks have been 
sought for and welcomed into the 
world of academe — with Philip 
Klass (William Tenn) as only one 
example. Certainly I was never 
excluded. More than twenty years 
ago, I lectured and taught quite 
often at various college and other 
writing workshops. And even 

FORUM 



when I was teaching mystery 
stories or general marketing, con- 
siderable emphasis was placed on 
the fact that I was a well-known 
science fiction author. 

Of course, superficial study 
might indicate that the science 
fiction magazines were a sort of 
restricted group. They were usu- 
ally clumped together in the 
stands. Rut things weren’t that 
simple, even there. Back in the 
days before 1950 — when there 
were a lot of fiction magazines- 
— many of the general pulps fea- 
tured science fiction. So did some 
of the slicks. And when I was first 
reading, I found much of the best 
science fiction in the pages of 
American Boy, Saturday Evening 
Post and Harper’s, to name only 
three. Nope, no real discrimina- 
tion there. 

In fact, there never was any 
kind of a ghetto for science fic- 
tion. There were specialized 
magazines for it — but in those 
days, there were specialized 
magazines for almost every in- 
terest. And many of the writers 
and readers tended to join to- 
gether to promote their interest 
in the field. But if getting to- 
gether sometimes in somewhat 
exclusive groups created a ghetto, 
then the finest example of a 
ghetto I know is the typical exclu- 
sive country club! 

I’ve belabored the point about 
our “ghetto ” because I think the 
term must be proved wrong. Too 



71 




many people who are setting 
themselves up to criticize and 
guide us have been using it. I 
think it’s time we took a good 
look at them with a clear under- 
standing of how easily they fall 
into error. And when anyone sets 
himself (or herself) up to examine 
our field critically — and then be- 
gins with a false major assumption 
about that field — we can damned 
well be suspicious of every other 
assumption! What kind of critic 
accepts a false cliche as a working 
datum about the subject being 
criticised? 

I’m not opposed to criticism, in 
its fullest sense. For years, from a 
number of public platforms. I’ve 
been lamenting the dearth of 
good criticism. I’d like to see 
someone do for science fiction 
what C. S. Lewis did for the 
medieval romance — or for litera- 
ture in general in his Experiment 
in Criticism. I’d like to see some- 
one like Exra Pound use his criti- 
cal scalpel on us. It would be 
good for us — and maybe I’d enjoy 
reading that criticism as much as I 
enjoyed the critical works of 
Lewis and Pound. 

But I don’t want criticism of 
our works or our attitudes that is 
based upon adjurations to open 
our minds to the truth — and is it- 
self filled with the hoariest of bad 
critical judgment as to what we 
are. 

I agree completely with James 
Gunn when he says: “If science 

72 



fiction has any vitality, criticism 
won’t kill it. .so long as the 
writers do not accept the critics as 
final arbiters. ” In fact, I don’t 
think the cant of criticism (as 
Sterne put it in Tristram Shandy 
more than two centuries ago), 
though it be most tormenting, can 
ever kill science fiction; that was 
proved by its resistance to the 
gibes of the critics during its first 
thirty years. But unfortunately, 
too many writers are beginning to 
write for the approval of the cri- 
tics, rather than for themselves or 
their readers. Public reaction to a 
book is diffuse and slow to dis- 
cover; but the words of the critic 
are direct and often quick. It’s a 
temptation to write for those 
words, and try to make them 
pleasant ones. And even sadder, 
some of the publishers and editors 
on the book field seem to accept 
the critics as in some measure ar- 
biters of what science should be. 
Criticism can’t kill the field — but 
it can distort it, at least for a 
time, if it is misinformed or self- 
serving. 

I agree that we need “literary 
feedback, criticism from sophisti- 
cated critics. ” We need critics 
who are thoroughly conversant 
with the great body of literature 
of all kinds and who are also con-

be a lousy critic of science fiction 
without long familiarity with it- 
— because the ways in which it 
does not conform will irritate his 
sensibilities so much that he may 
well not see the virtues that are 
unique to it. 

But I cannot agree that we are 
about to get valuable criticism 
from the teachers whom Gunn 
seems to equate with critics. He 
says they tend to be enthusiastic, 
open, experimental. (Having 
talked to a lot of them. I’m not 
quite that enthusiastic, but let it 
go.) But are they knowledgable, 
capable of taste and judgment, 
aware of all the different types of 
science fiction, capable of asses- 
sing each according to its pur- 
pose? Most of them are not. 
Gunn admits that many do not 
know enough. But he passes that 
over by the comment that “every 
new discipline begins with no 
qualified teachers.” That simply 
isn’t so, unless by qualified he 
means qualified as a teacher by 
some university. In the first 
place, science fiction isn’t a new 
discipline — it’s almost fifty years 
old as a category — and older still 
if you count the many true sci- 
ence fiction stories published be- 
fore the first category magazine. 
In the second place, almost every 
new discipline begins with the 
best possible teachers: the first 
ones to teach a discipline are the 
men and women who have disco- 
vered it; they teach others, who

then teach the engineers who 
must make it work — who then set 
up the first regular teaching 
courses. 

Of course some of the teachers 
who give the courses in science 
fiction are qualified by long ex- 
perience with the field. I saw the 
list of books and outline of the 
course given by Professor Low at 
NYU a couple of years ago, and 
his approach was excellent in 
every way. There are a few other 
cases, including men who have 
not only read but written sf for 
years. (Gunn is a fine example.) 
But I ve also been approached for 
help by teachers who obviously 
know little about the field — which 
wouldn’t necessarily be bad if 
they were willing to read exten- 
sively and learn, but is bad be- 
cause they usually feel that the 
field really requires no study of 
one who has taught “serious” lit- 
erature. I’ve seen lopsided lists of 
books of every kind. 

A few years ago, I went to lec- 
ture at a workshop conducted by 
a local college. The teacher did 
know something of science fiction, 
but didn’t seem to care much for 
it. He grew increasingly unhappy 
as I answered a question from one 
student about the structure of a 
story that would sell to a 
magazine. When I finally used the 
nasty word plot, he could stand it 
no longer. “Oh,” he broke in, 
“you’re talking about what we call 
good story!” He sniffed in con- 



73 




tempt. “We don’t teach that 
here.” 

Later, I had a chance to read a 
book he’d written. I could see 
why he didn’t teach such things as 
plotting, structure, consistency, or 
sound motivation. He didn’t un- 
derstand them, hence had to hold 
them in contempt. His choice of 
reading material also showed that. 
He’s still teaching science fiction 
courses. 

I’ve also had the opportunity to 
read a fair number of articles and 
books on science fiction done by 
those who are teaching science 
fiction or hope to teach it. Most of 
the so-called criticism consists of 
trying to impose some far-fetched 
theory onto science fiction, trying 
to force it into some more familiar 
mold, or simple attempts at stick- 
ing some label or other onto it to 
replace “science fiction”. Most of 
it is ignorant and misleading. In 
fact, one of the few bright spots 
was L. David Allen’s Cliff Notes, 
which Cunn mentions. That was a 
good guide to the teaching of sci- 
ence fiction courses; but it was 
not (and wasn’t intended to be) a 
work of criticism of the type sci- 
ence fiction needs. 

Leaving the need for critics 
aside for the moment. I’d like to 
see a far better job of teaching 
science fiction than I’ve usually 
observed. The average course 
among the better ones I know 
about seems to take the historical 



approach — start with older books 
and work forward. That might be 
all right for a true study course, 
but most of these courses are 
supposedly designed with less 
ambitious goals; Cunn rightly 
seems to value them fiar their abil- 
ity to arouse interest in the field. 

A majority of the students in 
most classes probably haven’t read 
a great deal of science fiction. 
(Some have, and are taking it as a 
“snap” course. But they probably 
know more than the average 
teacher, anyhow.) The problem is 
to lead them to open their minds 
to this somewhat different litera- 
ture. And for that purpose, the 
sensible program, it seems to me, 
would be to start the course with 
fairly simple but good stories, 
such as Heinlein’s so-called 
juveniles, among which I’d re- 
commend Tunnel in the Sky or 
Start Beast, or Clarke’s Sands of 
Mars-, then move up through van 
Vogt’s Sian-, and finally they can 
try reading Herbert’s Dune, and 
so on. 

Also, the emphasis should be 
on reading, rather than studying. 
Maybe the works of Tolstoy, 
Kafka and Joyce need to be 
studied; I wouldn’t know, since I 
prefer reading to studying it 
— certainly when I first read it. 
And certainly most science fiction 
was meant to be read rather than 
studied; even in most of the bet- 
ter works the story is the thing 
because it was meant to be. Stu-

dents get into the habit of under- 
lining passages, pondering over 
some “significant” phrase, etc. 
That only gets in the way of read- 
ing most science fiction. Save it 
for Hesse and Gibran. 

When I was teaching a course 
in modern fantasy, I began with 
the announcement that I wanted 
no such nonsense, and that I’d 
downgrade anyone whose books 
were marked up. I also advised 
against taking notes in class. 
There were some heavy frowns 
from the class. But I think it paid 
off. At the end of the course, sev- 
eral students commented on 
being surprised at how much fun 
they’d had and at how many 
books they’d read. “You know, 
you were right,” one young man 
told me. ‘Reading doesn’t have to 
be work. It’s even better than 
television sometimes.” 

I wish the teachers — or most of 
them — would make the same dis- 
covery. As a writer (in or out of 
any ghetto), I can ask nothing 
more than to be read for pleasure. 
I don’t want to be studied. I once 
was introduced to an audience by 
a professor who had analyzed a 
fair number of my stories. He 
spent forty minutes telling the 
audience why and how I had done 
what I did. Then he left and I had 
the pleasure of spending another 
forty minutes explaining why al- 
most every bit of his his careful 
analysis was totally wrong. How- 
ever, I tried to be reasonably tact- 



ful; after all, my stories were in 
good company. He was wrong 
about the Bible, too. There is no 
Book of Exultations. I made that 
up (at the top of the last chapter 
of “For I Am a Jealous People ”) as 
a hint to the reader that mankind 
had won the war against God. 

But maybe all this just goes to 
prove Gunn’s point that we’re 
suspicious of overtures from out- 
side the field. I must admit that 
I’m very suspicious sometimes. 
Especially when those overtures 
include requests that I im- 
mediately sit down and supply the 
basic knowledge that will go into 
somebody’s thesis; or when said 
overtures consist of invitations for 
me to come to some affair put on 
by academe and donate my ser- 
vices, thus assuring some measure 
of success for the work the over- 
turer is being paid to do. I like a 
certain amount of brass in certain 
overtures but not that much, I’m 
afraid. 

And I am suspicious of over- 
tures from inside the field — to 
academe, perchance — when they 
contain bias and error against the 
field. 

I’m also in accord with Ms. 
LeGuin’s rules that say science 
fiction must have intellectual 
coherence and scientific plausibil- 
ity, as well as scientific compe- 
tence. In fact. I’m in agreement 
with all the hundreds — including 
myself^ — who’ve repeatedly said

that. But when she starts talking 
about the fiction of the “Golden 
Age,” I’d like to find more histor- 
ical coherence and plausibility. 
She says we know what sf was like 
in the Golden Age of Science Fic- 
tion. To wit, the young girl coos 
questions about the gadget. And 
Prof. Higgins "explains how it 
works for about six pages.” Then 
enter the dauntless Star Captain, 
etc. 

Sorry, Ms. LeGuin, I don’t 
know it was like that in the Gol- 
den Age of Science Fiction- 
— which ran more or less from 
1938 to ,1950. No, I can’t re- 
member it that way at all; 1 was 
reading it and writing it then, but 
I just don’t remember it that way! 
The scene described did happen, 
more or less, in science fiction 
magazines; but it came from the 
birthing days of our literature. It 
was pretty well weeded out by 
1934, and getting rare even be- 
fore. Our writers had to learn 
how to handle fiction where new 
technology and new societies 
were in need of explaining in each 
story; but they caught on pretty 
fast, or the editors were rejecting 
all their stories by the beginning 
of the Golden Age. 

Oh, there were some magazines 
where such . schlock was 
published — but they certainly 
weren’t the leading ones, by any 
means, nor were they the favo- 
rites of those most “ghetto-ized” 
among the readers. I wonder just 

76 



what Ms. LeGuin was reading 
back in those days? Surely not the 
works of Heinlein, Asimov, 
Sturgeon, Simak, de Camp, or 
even myself, to name a few. 

She also admits that “recent 
American sf has been full of 
stories tackling totalitarianism, 
nationalism, over-population, pre- 
judice, racism, sexism, militarism, 
and so on. ” 

Recent? I can recall stories de- 
aling with every one of those 
things going back to the early 
thirties — and some before that. 
Science fiction quickly got over its 
anthropocentrism and stopped 
confusing form with degree of cir- 
tue long ago. Indeed, one of its 
major values was spreading the 
doctrine that the “bad guys ’ 
didn’t have to look different nor 
the “good dyas” look like us but 
that ever>' race and kind could be 
either bad or good, and that this 
depended on its goals and motiva- 
tions, not its form. Heinlein and I 
were writing science fiction for 
school libraries in which we had 
all colors and races — yes, and 
people who happened to be 
female — put in space long before 
Ms. LeGuin started writing. And 
we did it without making a big 
thing of it, but as something to be 
taken very much for granted. Too 
much of recent science fiction has 
done it in a way that indicates the- 
writers are trying to be noticed 
for the “relevance”, but that’s not 
the way to get the best results.

D now for escapism. I agree 
that the big question is sometimes 
whether you’re escaping to values 
or from them. Good literature 
deals in values and the human 
condition, whatever the stage on 
which it’s played. But I’d like to 
suggest that the poorest literature 
for escapism is science fiction. If 
ybu want simple escape, try the 
average western novel with its 
simplified code of values — or the 
sports story, where winning is the 
only value — or the detective tale, 
where all too often good is “us” 
and evil is “them” and nothing we 
do to them, no matter how ugly, 
is bad. Or try some of the regular 
books, where all human value is 
rejected, and a fool who does noth- 
ing and learns nothing except 
perhaps to have a few affairs and 
gorge on self-pity is considered 
worthy of 300 pages or more. Sci- 
ence fiction, which demands that 
the reader enter and accept many 
new ways of looking at the world, 
is perhaps the least escapist of all 
literature. Sure, it isn’t for 
real — but neither is Faulkner nor 
Heller. If you want reality — at 
least one side of it — try Gorki. 

Anyhow, what’s wrong with es- 
cape literature, however you de- 
fine it? Despite the mouthings of 
the crypto-Marxists (it is a purely 
Marxist doctrine that all art must 
serve other functions than “mere ” 
art — this is an idea foreign to all 
previous concepts of artistic 
merit.) not everything in life has 



to have a Purpose and carry a 
banner inscribed with “I Serve!” 
There are lots of escapist activities 
that enjoy high repute, such as 
collecting coins, or playing chess. 
(Don’t get me wrong; I think 
chess is a marvelously intellectual 
game — but it isn’t of any more 
value to anyone or anything than 
is watching football, another bit of 
escapism.) 

In fact that ancient “escapist” 
label is just another convenient 
cliche, one probably tossed (and 
properly so) at Rabelais and (even 
more properly, since he was try- 
ing to escape from his real impo- 
tence to punishing his enemies by 
make-believe) against Dante. It’s 
like another label used much too 
carelessly; pulp. Pulp fiction is 
not necessarily bad nor. necessar- 
ily good. Most of Conrad, Kipl- 
ing, and I don’t know how many 
other writers was published first 
in the pulp magazines here. 
Somehow, practically all of the 
“slick” fiction and most of the 
“quality” fiction of the same 
period is no longer read, and for 
good reason. 

Maybe if more people would 
read C. S. Lewis’ An Experiment 
in Criticism, they’d stop falling 
back on such trite devices. He 
took a careful look at what and 
why people read. If Ms. LeGuin 
is not familiar with the book, she 
should be. It’s one of the lovely 
jewels that sometimes comes from 
academe.

Ah, yes. There have to be some 
respectable writers, all from a list 
Ms. LeGuin points out as not 
being American. Curiously, I find 
Eddison missing from the list, so 
let me add him to Wells, Orwell 
(who wrote dystopias, not science 
fiction), Huxley (mostly ditto), 
Capek and Stapledon. (I refuse to 
add Zamyatin to the list.) I might 
point out that most of them were 
printed in the early science fiction 
magazines and somehow found 
their way into our ghetto world. 
But that doesn’t matter. It’s a 
good list. It supports the proper 
critical view that American litera- 
ture doesn’t amount to much, and 
that any really cultured view must 
be gained from European works. 

The trouble is that these are 
works basically written outside 
the field of science fiction, delib- 
erately meant to fit into the broad 
stream of European literature. I 
would never point to them to 
prove that science fiction, per se, 
isn’t escapist. They have 'nothing 
to do with any criticism of what 
writers should be doing now in 
the field. Maybe we should write 
more like those books — but if we 
did, we’d have very small chance 
of getting our works published. 
Those books were written before 
the field was mined completely, 
and a writer can’t go back to the 
beginnings after the beginnings 
are gone. 

Nevertheless, there are some 
American books that I might point 

78 



to as being far from merely es- 
capist. There is Austin Tappan 
Wright’s Islandia, which dealt 
with many of the burning issues 
on the campuses today — but dealt 
with them early in the century. 
(It’s at least as legitimately science 
fiction as Orwell or Huxley.) And 
there is Frank Herbert’s Dune, 
dealing not merely with ecology 
but far more with a philosophy of 
man and progress. And there is 
indeed Ursula K. LeGuin’s Left 
Hand of Darkness, which I con- 
sider a unique study of the nature 
of human love, worthy to stand 
beside any European literature, 
but beholden to itself alone. Let’s 
not fall into the popular cliche 
among intellectuals that every- 
thing American is trash. 

Of course, the guardians and 
acolytes of academe tend naturally 
to a conservative outlook in the 
humanities, which makes them 
suspicious of newer works and 
newer ways. This is quite proper 
for the needs of academe, and I 
respect them for it within their 
proper area. They must conserve 
the best of human achievements 
and attempt to instil a respect for 
and understanding of such works 
in their students, who tend to be 
impatient with anything not cur- 
rent. The very nature of their 
work demands a somewhat con- 
servative outlook. 

And similarly conservatived 
limits are demanded of those who 
evaluate and determine the best 



GALAXY 




current work. There is no sure 
guide to enduring value except 
time and hindsight; the success of 
those who have tried to make 
quick decisions on values has 
been woefully bad. Too many of 
the “great” works of one genera- 
tion prove valueless to another. 
And too many of the relatively 
unnoticed works come to be ap- 
preciated properly only after 
many years have passed. 

But that very conservativism 
must make the critics who serve 
in such institutions highly suspect 
when they attempt to evaluate or 
guide in something as new and 
multiform as science fiction. 

Both the articles under discus- 
sion seem to take it for granted 
that the criticism we will have 
from the world of academe will 
enable us to improve science fic- 
tion. But will they? What is their 
track record? They have been 
busy improving the novels of the 
mainstream for quite a few years; 
they were already at work on 
that, though less obviously, when 
I began reading criticism forty 
years ago. Lately, they’ve cap- 
tured a fair amount of space in 
the largest-circulation review 
magazine, as well as in the more 
learned critical forums. Has the 
mainstream' improved that much? 

Not by what I hear from 
academe! I keep hearing that the 
novel is either a dead or dying 
form. Could it be that all their 



improvements have simply turned 
a healthy creation into a 
moribund one, even in their own 
judgment? If that’s the improve- 
ment we can expect from them 
then I, for one, want no part in it. 
If superior fiction is based only 
upon the essential tragedy of 
Man, then let me write trash in 
which I can sometimes indulge in 
the idea that being a man is so 
much better than being nonexis- 
tent or ameboid that I call it a 
triumph. If the use of a fairly 
simple style to describe the com- 
plexity of other worlds and times 
is the sign of my pulp back- 
ground, then so be it; J have no 
intention of developing the elabo- 
rated, tortuous, impressionistic or 
“experimental” style that may be 
necessary to perk up the thread- 
bare nature of most mainstream 
ideas. (I’m not convinced it helps, 
even there.) And if trying to de- 
velop tight and explicit plots 
makes me a hack, then I’ll get by 
with my royalties and leave the 
plaudits of the critics to those who 
find them necessary. 

That doesn’t mean my mind is 
completely closed. But it isn’t 
wide open to the overtures of 
anyone outside the field — or to 
most of those within it, for that 
matter. 

No I’ll stick with what I know 
of the universe — which is a long 
ways from being wide open in all 
ways. There are quite a few 
rather rigid limits on that uni- 



FORUM 



79 




verse, without which it wouldn’t 
work. There is that pesky limita- 
tion on velocity which seems to 
make a faster-than-light drive im- 
possible, and even a near-light 
drive incredibly demanding on 
energy source?. Maybe that will 
be bypassed some day; let’s hope 
so. But there remain several con- 
servation laws (mass-energy, 
momentum, angular momentum, 
and more) which set limits on us. 
And just maybe thermodynamics 
and other rules indicate the whole 
universe is running down — that it 
will be all closed eventually, de- 
spite Ms. LeGuin’s faith. I intend 
to be a bit skeptical still as to the 
blandishments of new scientific or 
literary theories. 

Science fiction has evolved 
pretty much by itself for nearly 
fifty years. During that time, it 
has grown and developed'. Now, 
at a time when most literature is 
in decline — despite the nostrums 
of its bedside critics— science fic- 
tion is healthily capturing more 
and more readers. Perhaps there 
is something to be said for a field 
that can establish and maintain its 
own values. 

During almost forty years. I’ve 
spent a lot of time outside the 
“ghetto” reading works of every 
description, including a fair 
amount of criticism. I’ve tried as 
best I can to improve my techni- 
ques of writing, in science fiction 
and far outside it. I’ve always 
been grateful for the help some 

eo 



criticism has given. But I’m sus- 
picious enough to open my mind 
only when I find that the critic 
knows his field (mine, if it’s sci- 
ence fiction he’s criticizing) at 
least as well as I do and that he 
know something beyond the limits 
of his field. And I insist on my 
right to stick to the style and 
ideas I want to write and like to 
read. 

Thus I refuse to take Gunn’s 
final advice seriously. I’ve heard 
for decades that writers must 
broaden the appeal of science fic- 
tion. Experience teaches me that 
this is another of those cliches 
that is false. I don’t really believe 
in the lowest common de- 
nominator appeal for science fic- 
tion. I’ve seen the results of 
broadening the appeal of televi- 
sion from the early, experimental 
and sometimes marvelous begin- 
nings. I prefer to write for those 
with sufficient flexibility and intel- 
lect to be able to grasp science 
fiction as it is, and to appreciate it 
at its best and most demanding. 
Until the self-termed critics can 
do as much and can come up with 
more than cliches (half of them 
untrue). I’ll remain an unregener- 
ate writer and reader of science 
fiction. 

Until then —

But one of us knifed Brand be-

nothing else, this confirmed the 
suspicion that it had to be one of 
us. Gerard took charge of the in- 
jured and expelled the rest of us 
from the room. We adjourned to 
other quarters and engaged in a 
fruitless session of guesswork, 
threats, promises and accusa- 
tions. When we ran out of bad 
words we retired. Brand was still 
hanging on. 

Fiona had told me that overex- 
posure to the Jewel of Judgment 
resulted in severe and possibly 
fatal stress on the wearer, a con- 
dition initially characterized by a 
distortion of one’s time sense. 
This phenomenon did seem to be 
developing as I made my way to 
my quarters. I did not have a 
chance to explore my symptoms 
further because I was knifed on 
entering my bedroom. 

I came around lying on my old 
bed in my old house on the 
shadow Earth, the place where I 
had resided back when I had 
been Carl Corey. Crawling, I 
made it out of the house and into 
a snowstorm. As my time sense 
was still distorted, I buried the 
jewel in my old compost heap be- 
fore heading down to the road- 
side. 

I finally managed to flag down 
a car, driven by one of my 
former neighbors — my old friend 
Bill Roth. He took me to the 
same clinic where I had been 
taken years before, back when I 
had had my accident. The doctor 
who had been on duty in the 



emergency room that night was 
also present then and something 
about me, plus an unusually 
thorough medical records sys- 
tems, brought it all back to him. 
Doubtful as to my rationality, he 
told me part of the story. Bill 
later filled in the rest. 

During those dark times in my 
memory there had been two 
other medical facilities, not one. I 
had been committed to a 
sanitarium in Albany on a bum 
order certifying I needed it. 
There, I had apparently received 
some shock therapy. Whatever its 
effects, I escaped two days later 
and was heading back in the gen- 
eral direction of my home when 
the accident occurred. From the 
fake names used as next of kin 
and attending physician in con- 
nection with my committment, as 
well as from the police report’s 
description of my rescuer, it be- 
came apparent that it had been 
Brand who had been trying to re- 
store my memory and Brand who 
had probably saved my life by 
getting me out of my car and 
over to the shore, by administer- 
ing what aid he could while wait- 
ing for help to arrive. It was only 
later that I wound up in Green- 
wood. 

Now both of us lay punctured, 
and someone back in Amber must 
have been more than a little con- 
cerned that one or both of us 
might survive. As I lay contemp- 
lating these and other matters. 
Random contacted me via my 
Trump to tell me that Brand had 
regained consciousness and was 
asking for me.

alty, I’ve just bou^t me a naval 
commission,” I said. “Give me 
something to wear. ’’ 

He draped a long, heavy cloak 
about my shoulders and I fumbled 
to clasp it at my throat. 

“All set, ” I said. “Take me to 
him.” 

He led me out the door, into 
the hall, toward the stair. I leaned 
on him heavily as we went. 

“How bad is it?” he asked me. 
“Knife,” I said, and laid my 
hand on the spot. “Someone at- 
tacked me in my room last night. ” 
“Who?” 

“Well, it couldn’t have been 
you, because I had just left you,” 
I said, “and Gerard was up in the 
library with Brand. Subtract the 
three of you from the rest and 
start guessing. That is the best — ” 
“Julian,” he said. 

“His stock is definitely 
bearish,” I said. “Fiona was just 
running him down for me last 
night, and of course it is no secret 
that he is not my favorite — ” 
“Corwin, he’s gone. He cut out 
during the night. The servant who 
came to get me told me that 
Julian left an hour or. so after the 
rest of us turned in. What does 
that look like to you?” 

We reached the stair. I kept one 
hand on Random and the other 



on the banister. I called a halt at 
the first landing and rested there 
briefly. 

“I don’t know,” I said. “It can 
sometimes be just as bad to ex- 
tend the benefit of the doubt too 
&r as not to grant it at all. But it 
does occur to me that if he 
thought he had disposed of me, 
he would look a lot better by stay- 
ing here and acting surprised to 
learn of it than by getting the hell 
out. That does look suspicious. I 
am inclined to think he might 
have departed because he was a- 
fraid of what Brand would have to 
say when he came around.” 

“But you lived, Corwin. You 
got away from whoever attacked 
you, and he could not be certain 
he had done you in. If it were 
me, I would be worlds away by 
now.” 

‘ “There is that,” I acknow- 
ledged, and we started on down 
again. “Yes, you might well be 
right. Let us leave it academic for 
now. And no one is to know I 
have been injured.” 

He nodded. 

“As you say. Silence beats a 
chamber pot in Amber.” 

“How’s that? ” 

“’Tis gilt, m’lord, like a royal 
flush.” 

“Your wit pains both wounded 
and unwounded parts. Random. 
Spend some figuring how the as- 
sailant entered my room.” 

“Your panel?” 

“It secures from the inside. I 
keep it that way now. And the 
door’s lock is a new one. Tricky.” 
“All right, I have it. My answer 
requires that it be a family 
member, too. ”

“Tell me. ” 

“Someone was willing to psych 
himself up and tough it through 
the Pattern again Tor a shot at 
you. He went below, walked it, 
projected himself into your room 
and attacked you.” 

“That would be perfect except 
for one thing. We all left at pretty 
much the same time. The attack 
did not occur later on in the even- 
ing. It happened immediately on 
my entering. There wasn’t even 
sufficient time for one of us to get 
down to the chamber, let alone 
negotiate the Pattern. The at- 
tacker was already waiting. So if it 
was one of us, he had gotten in 
by some other means.” 

“Then he picked your lock, 
tricks and all.” 

“Possibly, ” I said, as we 
reached the landing and con- 
tinued on. “We will rest at the 
comer so that I can go on into the 
library unassisted. 

“Sure thing.” 

We did that. I composed my- 
self, drew the cloak completely 
about me, squared my shoulders, 
advanced and knocked on the 
door. 

“Just a minute” — Gerard’s 
voice. 

Footsteps approaching the 
door. 

“Who is it?” 

'“Corwin,” I said. “Random’s 
with me.” 

I heard him call back, “You 
want Random, too?” and I heard a 
soft “No” in reply. 

The door opened. 

“Just you, Corwin,” Gerard 
said. 

I nodded, turned to Random. 



“Later,” I told him. 

He returned my nod and 
headed back in the direction from 
which we had come. I entered 
the library. 

“Open your cloak, Corwin,” 
Gerard ordered. 

“That is not necessary, ” Brand 
said, and I looked over and saw 
that he was propped up by a 
number of cushions and showing a 
yellow-toothed smile. 

“Sorry, I am not as trusting as 
Brand,” Gerard said, "and I will 
not have my work wasted. Let’s 
have a look. ’ 

"I said that it is not necessary,” 
Brand repeated. “He is not the 
one who stabbed me.” 

Gerard turned quickly. 

“How do you know he isn’t?” 
he asked. 

“Because I know who did, of 
course. Don’t be an ass, Gerard. I 
wouldn’t have asked for him if I 
had reason to fear him. ” 

“You were unconscious when I 
brought you through. You 
couldn’t know who did it.” 

“Are you certain of that?” 

“Well. Why didn’t you tell 
me, then?” 

“I have my reasons, and they 
are valid ones. I want to speak 
with Corwin alone now.” 

Gerard lowered his head. 

“You had better not be deliri- 
ous,” he said. He stepped to the 
door, opened it again. “I’ll be 
within hailing distance,” he 
added, and closed it behind him. 

I moved nearer. Brand reached 
up and I clasped his hand. 

“Good to see that you made it 
back,” he szid. 

“Vice-versa,” I said, and then I 

85 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 




took Gerard’s chair, trying not to 
collapse into it. 

“How do you feel now?” I 
asked. 

“Rotten, in one sense. But bet- 
ter than I have in ^ears, in 
another. It’s all relative. ’ 

“Most thirtgs are.” 

“Not Amber.” 

I sighed. 

“All right. I wasn’t getting 
technical. What the hell hap- 
pened?” 

His gaze was most intense. He 
was studying me, looking for 
something. M^at? Knowledge, I’d 
guess. Or, more correctly, ignor- 
ance. Negatives being harder to 
gauge, his mind had to be moving 
fast, must have bene from the 
moment he had come around. 
Knowing him, he was more in- 
terested in what I did not know 
than in what I knew. He wasn’t 
going to give away anything if he 
could help it. He wanted to know 
the minimum enlightenment he 
need shed in order to get what he 
wanted. Not a watt more would 
he willingly spend. For this was 
his way, and of course he wanted 
something. Unless. 

More strongly in recent years 
than ever before I have tried to 
convince myself that people do 
change, that the passage of time 
does not serve merely to accen- 
tuate that which is already there, 
that qualitative changes do some- 
times occur in people because of 
things they have done, seen, 
thought and felt. It would provide 
some small solace in- times such as 
these when everything else seems 
to be going wrong, not to mention 
pepping up my mundane philo- 

86 



Sophy no end. And Brand had 
probably been responsible for 
saving my life and my memory, 
whatever his reasons. Very well. I 
resolved to give him the doubt’s 
benefit without exposing my back. 
A small concession here, my 
move against the simple psychol- 
ogy of humors which generally 
governs the openings of our 
games. 

“Things are never what they 
seem, Corwin,” he began. “Your 
friend today is your enemy tomor- 
row, and — ” 

“Cut it out!” I said. “Cards on 
the table time is here. I do ap- 
preciate what Brandon Corey did 
for me, and it was my idea to try 
the trick we used to locate you 
and bring you back.” 

He nodded. 

“I fancy there were good 
reasons for a recrudescence of 
fraternal sentiment after all this 
time.” 

“I might suppose you had addi- 
tional reasons for helping me, 
also. ” 

He smiled again, raised his 
right hand and lowered it. 

“Then we are either even, or in 
one another’s debt, depending 
upon how one looks at these 
things. As it would seem we now 
have need of one another, it 
would be well to regard ourselves 
in the most flattering light.” 

“You are stalling, Brand. You 
are trying to psych me. You are 
also spoiling my day’s effort at 
idealism. You got me out of bed 
to tell me something. Be my 
guest.” 

“Same old Corwin,” he said, 
chuckling. Then he looked away.

“Or are you? I wonder. Did it 
change you, do you think? Living 
all that while in Shadow? Not 
knowing who you really were? 
Being a part of something else?” 

“Maybe,” I said. “I don’t know. 
Yes, I guess^ it did. I know that it 
shortened my temper when it 
comes to family politics.” 

“Plain-speaking, blunt, plain- 
dealing? You miss some of the fun 
that way. But then there is a 
value to such novelty. Keep 
everyone unbalanced with it. 
Revert when they least expect 
it. Yes, it might prove valu- 
able. Refreshing, too. All right! 
Panic not. Thus end my pre- 
liminaries. All pleasantries are 
now exchanged. I’ll bare the 
basics, bridle the beast Unreason 
and wrest from murky mystery 
the pearl of sweetest sense. But 
one thing first, if you would. 
Have you anything smokable with 
you? It has been a number of 
years, and I’d like some foul weed 
or other — to celebrate my home- 
coming.” 

I started to say no. But I was 
sure there were some cigarettes 
in the desk, left there by me. I 
did not really want the exercise, 
but, “Just a minute” I said. 

I tried to make my movements 
look casual rather than stiff as I 
rose and crossed the room. I at- 
tempted to make it seem as if I 
were resting my hand naturally 
upon the desktop as I rummaged 
throu^ it, rather than leaning as 
heavily as I was. I masked my 
movements with my body and my 
cloak as much as possible. 

I located the package and re- 
turned as I had come, stopping to 

SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



light a pair at the hearth. Brand 
was slow in taking his from me. 

“Your hand is rather shaky,” he 
said. “What is the matter?” 

“Too much partying last night,” 
I said, returning to my chair. 

“I hadn’t thought of that. I im- 
agine there would have been, 
wouldn’t there? Of course. 
Everyone together in one 
room. Unexpected success in 
finding me, bringing me back. 
A desperate move on the part of a 
very nervous, very guilty 
person. Half-success there. 
Me injured and mum, but for 
how long? Then — ” 

“You said that you knew who 
did it. Were you kidding?” 

“No, I was not.” 

“Who then?” 

“In its place, dear brother. In 
its place. Sequence and order, 
time and stress — they are most 
important in this matter. Allow 
me to savor the drama of the 
event in safe retrospect. I see me 
punctured and all of you gathered 
round. Ah! what would I not give 
to witness that tableau! Could you 
possibly describe for me the ex- 
pression on each face?” 

“I’m afraid their faces were my 
least concern at the time.” 

He sighed and blew smoke. 

“Ah, that is good,’’ he said. 
“Never mind, I can see their 
faces. I’ve a vivid imagination, 
you know. ' Shock, distress, 
puzzlement — shading over into 
suspicion, fear. Then all of you 
departed. I’m told, and gentle 
Gerard my nursemaid here.” He 
paused, stared into the smoke, 
and for a moment the note of 
mockery was absent. “He is the 




only decent one among us, you 
know. ” 

“He’s high on my list,” I said. 

“He took good care of me. He’s 
always looked out for the rest of 
us. .” He chuckled suddenly. 
“Frankly, I can’t see why he 
bothers, I was musing, 

though — prompted by your re- 
cuperating self — you must have 
adjourned to talk things over. 
There is another party I m sad I 
missed. All those emotions and 
suspicions and lies bouncing off 
one another — and no one wanting 
to be the first to say good night. 
It must have gotten shrill after a 
time. Everyone on his own best 
behavior, with an eye out to black- 
en the rest. Attempts to intimi- 
date the one guilty person. 
Perhaps a few stones shied at 
scapegoats. But, all in all, nothing 
much really accomplished. Am I 
right?” 

I nodded, appreciative of the 
way his mind worked and res- 
igned to his telling it his way. 

“You know you’re right,” I said. 

He gave me a sharp look 
at that, then went on, “But 
eveiyone did finally go off, to lie 
awake worrying, or to get to- 
gether with an accomplice, to 
scheme. There were hidden tur- 
moils in the night. It is flattering 
to know that my well-being was 
on everyone’s mind. Some, of 
course, were for it, others against. 
And in the midst of it all, I 
rallied — nay, flourished — not 

wishing to disappoint my suppor- 
ters. Gerard spent a long while 
bringing me up to date on recent 
history. When I had enough of 
this, I sent for you.” 

88 



“In case you haven’t noticed. 
I’m here. What did you want to 
tell me?” 

“Patience, brother! Patience! 
Consider all the years you spent 
in Shadow, not even 
remembering — this.” He gestured 
widely with his cigarette. “Con- 
sider all that time you waited, 
unknowing, until I succeeded in 
locating you and tried to remedy 
your plight. Surely a few mo- 
ments now are not so priceless by 
contrast.” 

“I was told that you had sought 
me,” I said. “I wondered at that, 
for we had not exactly parted on 
the best of terms the last time we 
were together.” 

He nodded. 

“I cannot deny it,” he said. 
“But I always ^et over such 
things, eventually. ’ 

I snorted. 

“I have been deciding how 
much to tell you, and what you 
would believe,” he continued. “I 
doubted you would accept it if I 
had simply come out and said 
that, save for a few small items, 
my present motives are almost 
entirely altruistic.” 

I snorted again. 

‘ — But this is true,” he went 
on, “and to lay your suspicions, I 
add that it is because I have small 
choice in it. Beginnings are al- 
ways difificult. Wherever I begin, 
something preceded it. You were 
gone for so long. If one must 
name a single thing, however, 
then let it be the throne. 
— ^There. I have said it. We had 
thought of a way to take it, you 
see. This was just after your dis- 
appearance, and in some ways, I 

GALAXY 




suppose, prompted by it. Dad 
suspected Eric of having slain 
you. But there was no evidence. 
We worked on this feeling, 
though — a word here and there, 
every now and then. Years pas- 
sed, with you unreachable by any 
means, and it seemed more and 
more likely that you were indeed 
dead. Dad looked upon Eric with 
growing disfavor. Then, one 
night, pursuant to a discussion I 
had begun on a totally neutral 
matter — most of us present at the 
table — he said that no fratricide 
would ever take the throne, and 
he was looking at Eric as he said 
it. You know now his eyes could 
get. Eric grew bright as a sunset 
and could not swallow for a long 
while. But then Dad took things 
much further than any of us had 
anticipated or desired. In fairness 
to you, I do not know whether he 
spoke solely to vent his feelings, 
or whether he actually meant 
what he said. But he told us that 
he had more than half-decided 
upon you as his successor, so that 
he took whatever misadventure 
had befallen you quite personally. 
He would not have spoken of it, 
but that he was now convinced as 
to your passing. In the months 
that followed, we reared you a 
cenotaph to give some solid form 
to this conclusion, and we made 
certain that no one forgot Dad’s 
feelings toward Eric. All along, 
after yourself, Eric was the one 
we felt had to be gotten around to 
reach the throne — ” 

“We! Who were the others?” 
“Patience, Corwin. Sequence 
and order, time and stress! Ac- 
cent, emphasis. Listen.” He 

SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



took another cigarette, chain-lit it 
from the butt, stabbed the air 
with its burning tip. "The next 
step required that we get Dad out 
of Amber. This was the most cru- 
cial and dangerous part of it, and 
it was here that we disagreed. I 
did not like the idea of an alliance 
with a power I did not fully un- 
derstand, especially one that gave 
them some hold on us. Using 
shadows is one thing; allowing 
them to use you is ill-considered, 
whatever the circumstances. I ar- 
gued against it, but the majority 
had it otherwise.” He smiled. 
“Two to one. Yes, there were 
three of us. We went ahead then. 
The trap was set and Dad went 
after the bait — ’’ 

“Is he still living?” I asked. 

“I do not know,” Brand said. 
“Things went wrong afterwards, 
and then I’d troubles of my owii 
to concern me. After Dad’s depar- 
ture, though, our next move was 
to consolidate our position while 
waiting a respectable period of 
time for a presumption of death to 
seem warranted. Ideally, all that 
we required Wias the cooperation 
of one person. Either Caine or 
Julian — it did not matter which. 
You see, Bleys had already gone 
off into Shadow and was in the 
process of putting together a large 
military force — ” 

“Bleys! He was one of you?” 
“Indeed. We intended him for 
the throne — with sufficient strings 
on him, of course, so that it 
would have amounted to a de 
facto triumvirate. So, he went off 
to assemble troops, as 1 was say- 
ing. We hoped for a bloodless 
takeover, but we had to be ready 

89 




in the event that words proved 
insufficient to win our case. If 
Julian gave us the land route in, 
or Caine the waves, we could 
have transported the troops with 
dispatch and held the day by 
force of arms, should that have 
proven necessary. Unfortunately, 
I chose the wrong man. In my es- 
timate, Caine was Julian’s 
superior in matters of corruption. 
So, with measured delicacy I 
sounded him on the matter. He 
seemed willing to go along with 
things, at first. But he either re- 
considered subsequently or de- 
ceived me quite skillfully from the 
beginning. Naturally, I prefer to 
befieve it was the former. What- 
ever, at some point he came to 
the conclusion that he stood to 
benefit more by supporting a rival 
claimant. To wit, Eric. Now Eric’s 
hopes had been somewhat dashed 
by Dad’s attitude toward him- 
— but Dad was gone, and our in- 
tended move gave Eric the 
chance to act as defender of the 
throne. Unfortunately for us, such 
a position would also put him but 
a step away from the throne itself. 
To make matters darker, Julian 
went along with Caine in pledging 
the loyalty of his troops to Eric, 
as defender. Thus was the other 
trio formed. So Eric took a public 
oath to defend the throne, and 
the lines were thereby drawn. I 
was naturally in a somewhat em- 
barassing position at this time. I 
bore the brunt of their animosity, 
as they did not know who my fel- 
lows were. Yet they coula not 
imprison or torture me, for I 
would immediately be trumped 
out of their hands. And if they 

90 



were to kill me, they realized 
there might well be a reprisal by 
parties unknown. So it had to 
stand as a stalemate for a time. 
They also saw that I could no 
longer move directly against 
them. They kept me under heavy 
surveillance. So a more devious 
route was charted. Again I disa- 
greed and again I lost, two to one. 
We were to employ the same 
forces we had called upon to deal 
with Dad, this time for purposes 
of discrediting Eric. If the job of 
defending Amber, so confidently 
assumed, were to prove too much 
for him and Bleys then came onto 
the scene and handled the situa- 
tion with dispatch, why Bleys 
would even have popular support 
as he moved on to assume the 
role of defender himself and- 
— after a fit period of time- 
— suffered the thrusting or 
sovereignty upon him, for the 
good of Amber. ’ 

“Question,” I interrupted. 
“What about Benedict? I know he 
was off being discontent in his 
Avalon, but if something really 
threatened Amber — ’’ 

“Yes, ” he said, nodding, “and 
for that reason, a part of our deal 
was to involve Benedict with a 
number of problems of his own. ” 

I thought of the harassment of 
Benedict’s Avalon by tbe hell- 
maids. I thought of the stump of 
his right arm. I opened my mouth 
to speak again, but Brand raised 
his hand. 

“Let me finish in my own fash- 
ion', Corwin. I am hot unmindful 
of your thought processes as you 
speak. I feel the pain in your 
side, twin to my own. Yes, I 

GALAXY 




know these things and many 
more.” His eyes burned strangely 
as he took another cigarette into 
his hand and it lit of its own ac- 
cord. He drew heavily upon it 
and spoke as he exhaled, “I broke 
with the others over this decision. 
I saw it as involving too great a 
peril, as placing Amber herself in 
jeopardy. Broke with them. .” 
He watched the smoke for several 
moments before he continued, 
“But things were too far advanced 
that I might simply walk away. I 
had to oppose them, in order to 
defend myself as well as Amber. 
It was too late to swing over to 
Eric’s side. He would not have 
protected me if he could have- 
— and besides, I was certain he 
was going to lose. It was then that 
I decided to employ certain new 
abilities I had acquired. 

“I had often wondered at the 
strange relationship between Eric 
and Flora, off on that shadow 
Earth she pretended so to enjoy. 
I had had a slight suspicion that 
there was something about that 
place which concerned him, and 
that she might be his agent there. 
While I could not get close 
enough to him to achieve any 
satisfaction on this count, I felt 
confident that it would not take 
too much in the way of investiga- 
tion, direct and otherwise, to 
learn what Flora was about. And 
so I did. Then suddenly the pace 
accelerated. My own party was 
concerned as to my whereabouts. 
Then when I picked you up and 
shocked back a few memories, 
Eric learned from Flora that 
something was suddenly quite 
amiss. Consequently, both sides 



were soon looking for me. I had 
decided that your return would 
throw everyone’s plans out the 
window and get me out of the 
pocket I was in long enough to 
come up with an alternative to 
the way things were going. Eric’s 
claim would be clouded once 
again, you would have had sup- 
porters of your own, my party 
would have lost the pupose for its 
entire maneuver and I had as- 
sumed you would not be ungrate- 
ful to me for my part in things. 
Then you went ana escaped from 
Porter, and things really got com- 
plicated. All of us were looking 
for you, as I later learned, for dif- 
ferent reasons. 

“But my former associates had 
something very extra going for 
them. They learned what was 
happening, located you and got 
there first. Obviously, there was a 
very simple way to preserve the 
status quo, where they would 
continue to hold the edge. Bleys 
fired the shots that put you and 
your car into the lake. I arrived 
just as this was occurring. He de- 
parted almost immediately, for it 
looked as if he had done a 
thorough job. I dragged you out 
though, and there was enough left 
to start treating. It was frustrating 
now that I think back on it, not 
knowing whether the treatment 
had really been effective, whether 
you would awaken as Corwin or 
Corey. It was frustrating after- 
wards, also, still not knowing. 
I hellrode out when help arrived. 
My associates caught up with me 
somewhat later and put me where 
you found me. Do you know the 
rest of the story?” 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN

“Not all of it. ” 

“Then stop me whenever we’ve 
caught up on this. I only obtained 
it later, myself. Eric’s crowd 
learned of the accident, got your 
location and had you transferred 
to a private place, where you 
could be better protected, and 
kept you heavily sedated, so that 
they could be protected.” 

“Why should Eric protect me, 
especially if my presence was 
going to wreck his plans?” 

“By then, seven of us knew you 
were still living. That was too 
many. It was simply too late to do 
what he would probably have 
liked to do. He was still trying to 
live down Dad’s words. If any- 
thing had happened to you once 
ou were in nis power, it would 
ave blocked his movement to the 
throne. If Benedict ever got word 
of it, or Gerard. No, ne’d not 
have made it. Afterwards, yes. 
Before, no. What happened was 
that general knowledge of the fact 
of your existence forced his hand. 
He scheduled his coronation and 
resolved to keep you out of the 
way until it had occurred. An ex- 
tremely premature bit of busi- 
ness, not that I see he had much 
of a choice. I guess you know 
what happened after that, since it 
happened to you. ” 

‘I fell in with Bleys, just as he 
was making his move. Not too for- 
tunate.” 

Brand shrugged. 

“Oh, it might have been — if 
you had won, and if you had been 
able to do something about Bleys. 
You hadn’t a chance though, not 
really. My grasp of their motiva- 
tions begins to dissolve at this 

92 



point, but I believe that that en- 
tire assault really constituted 
some sort of feint.” 

“Why?” 

“As I said, I do not know. But 
they already had Eric just about 
where they wanted him. It should 
not have been necessary to call 
that attack.” 

1 shook my head. Too much, 
too fast. Many of the facts 
sounded true, once I subtracted 
the narrator’s bias. But still. 

“I don’t know. .” I began. 

“Of course,” he said. “But if 
you ask me I will tell you.” 

“Who was the third member of 
your group?” 

‘The same person who stabbed 
me, of course. Would you care to 
venture a guess?” 

“Just tell me.” 

“Fiona. The whole thing was 
her idea.” 

“Why didn’t you tell me that 
right away? ” 

“Because you would not have 
sat still long enough to hear the 
rest of what I had to say. You 
would have dashed off to put her 
under restraint, discovered that 
she was gone, roused all the 
others, started an investigation 
and wasted a lot of valuable time. 
You still may, but it at least pro- 
vided me with your attention for a 
sufficient time for me to convince 
you that I know what I am about. 
Now, when I tell you that time is 
essential and that you must hear 
the rest of what I have to say as 
soon as possible — if Amber is to 
have any chance at all — you might 
listen rather than chase a crazy 
lady. ” 

I had already half-risen.

“I shouldn’t go after her?” I 
said. 

“The hell with her, for now. 
You’ve got bigger problems. You 
had better sit down again. 

So I did. 

X 

A. RAFT OF MOONBEAMS. The 
hostly torchlight, like fires in 
lack-and-white films. Stars. 
A few fine filaments of mist. 

I leaned upon the rail, I looked 
across the world. Utter silence 
held the night, the dream- 
drenched city, the entire universe 
from here. Distant things — the 
sea. Amber, Arden, Garnath, the 
Lighthouse of Cabra, the Grove of 
the Unicorn, my tomb atop 
Kovir. Silent, far below, yet 
clear, distinct. A god’s eye 
view. I’d say, or that of a soul cut 
loose and drifting high. In the 
middle of the ni^t. 

1 had come to the place where 
the ghosts play at being ghosts, 
where the omens, portents, signs 
and animate desires thread me 
nightly avenues and palace high 
halls of Amber in the sky, Tir-na 
nog’th. 

Turning, my back to the rail 
and dayworld’s vestiges below, I 
regarded the avenues and dark 
terraces, the halls of the lords, 
the quarters of the low. The 
moonlight is intense in Tir-na 
Nog’th, silvers over the facing 
sides of all our imaged places. 
Stick in hand, I passed forward, 
and the strangelings moved about 
me, appeared at windows, on bal- 
conies, on benches, at gates. 
Unseen I passed, for truly put, in 

SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



this place I was the ghost to 
whatever their substance. 

. .Silence and silver. 
Only the tapping of my stick, and 
that mostly muted. More mists 
adrift toward the heart of 
things. The palace a white bon- 
fire of it. Dew, like drops of 
mercuiy on the finely sanded pet- 
als and stems in the gardens by 
the walks. The passing moon 
as painful to the eye as the sun at 
midday, the stars outshone, dim- 
med by it. Silver and 
silence. The shine. 

I had not planned on coming, 
for its omens — if that they truly 
be — are deceitful, its similarities 
to the lives and places below un- 
settling, its spectacle often 
disconcerting. Still, I had 
come. A part of my bargain 
with time. 

After I had left Brand to con- 
tinue his recovery in the keeping 
of Gerard, I had realized that I 
required additional rest myself 
and sought to obtain it without 
betraying my disability. Fiona was 
indeed flown, and neither she nor 
Julian could be reached by means 
of the Trumps. Had I told Be- 
nedict and Gerard what Brand 
had told me, I was certain they 
would have insisted we begin ef- 
forts at tracking her down, at 
tracking both of them. I was 
equally certain that such efforts 
would prove useless. 

I had sent for Random and 
Ganelon and retired to my quar- 
ters, giving out that I intended to 
pass the day in rest and quiet 
thought in anticipation of spend- 
ing the night in Tir-na 



93 




Nog’th — reasonable behavior for 
any Amberite with a serious prob- 
lem. I did not put much stock in 
the practice, but most of the 
others did. As it was the perfect 
time for me to be about such a 
thing, I felt that it would make 
my day’s retirement believable, 
of course, this obliged me to fol- 
low through on it that night. But 
this too, was good. It gave me a 
day, a night and part of the fol- 
lowing day in which to heal suffi- 
ciently to carry my wound that 
much the better. I felt that it 
would be time well spent. 

You’ve got to tell someone, 
though. I told Random and I told 
Ganelon. Propped in my bed, I 
told them of the plans of Brand, 
Fiona and Bleys, and of the Eric- 
Julian-Caine cabal. I told them 
what Brand had said concerning 
my return and his own imprison- 
ment by his fellow conspirators. 
They saw why the survivors of 
both factions — Fiona and Julian- 
— had run off: doubtless to marshall 
their forces, hopefully to expend 
them on one another, but probably 
not. Not immediately, anyhow. 
More likely, one or the other would 
move to take Amber first. 

“They will just have to take 
numbers and wait their turns, like 
everyone else,” Random had said. 

“Not exactly,’’ I remembered 
saying. “Fiona’s allies and the 
things that have been coming in on 
the black road are the same 
gup.” 

And the Circle in Lorraine?” 
Ganelon had asked. 

“The same. That was how it 
manifested itself in that shadow. 
They came a great distance.” 

94 



“Ubiquitous bastards,” Random 
had said. 

Nodding, I had tried to explain. 

. .And so I came to Tir-na 
Nog’th. When the moon rose and 
the apparition of Amber came 
faintly into the heavens,- stars 
showing through it, pale halo 
about its towers, tiny flecks of 
movement upon its walls, I 
waited, waited with Ganelon and 
Random, waited on the highest 
crop of Kovir, there where the 
three steps are fashioned, 
roughly, out of the stone. 

. .When the moonlight 
touched them, the outline of the 
entire stairway began to take 
shape, spanning the great gulf to 
that point above the sea the vision 
city held. When the moonlight 
fell full upon it, the stair had 
taken as much of substance as it 
would ever possess, and I set my 
foot on the stone. Random 
held a fiill deck of Trumps and I’d 
mine within my jacket. Grays- 
wandir, forged upon this very 
stone by moonlight, held power 
in the city in the sky, and so I 
bore my blade along. I had re- 
sted all day, and I held a staff to 
lean upon. Illusion of distance 
and time. The stairs through 
the Corwin-ignoring sky escalate 
somehow, for it is not a simple 
arithmetic progression up them 
once motion has commenced. I 
was here, I was there, I was a 
quarter of the way up, before my 
shoulder had forgotten the clasp 
of Ganelon’s hand. If I looked 
too hard at any portion of the 
stair, it lost its shimmering opac- 
ity and I saw the ocean far below 
as through a translucent lens. I 

GALAXY 




lost track of time, though it seems 
it’s never long, afterwards. As 
far beneath the waves as I’d soon 
be above them, off to my right, 
glittering and curling, the outline 
of Rebma appeared within the 
sea. I thought of Moire, won- 
dered how she fared. What 
would become of our deepwater 
double should Amber ever fall? 
Would the image remain unshat- 
tered in its mirror? Or would 
building blocks and bones be 
taken and shaken alike, dice in 
the deepwater casino canyons our 
fleets fly over? No answer in the 
mandrowning Corwin-confounding 
waters, though I felt a twinge in my 
side. 

. .At the head of the stair, I 
entered, coming into the ghost 
city as one would enter Amber 
after mounting the great forestair 
up Kolvir’s seaward face. 

... .1 leaned upon the rail, 
looked across the world. 

The black road led off to the 
south. I could not see it by night. 
Not that it mattered. I knew now 
where it led. Or rather where 
Brand said that it led. As he ap- 
peared to have used up a life’s 
worth’s reasons for lying, I be- 
lieved that I knew where it led. 

. .All the way. 

. .From the brightness of 
Amber and the power and clean- 
shining splendor of adjacent 
Shadow, on through the progres- 
sively darkening slices of image 
that lead away in any direction, 
farther, through the twisted land- 
scapes, and farther still, on 
through places seen only when 
drunk, delirious or dreaming illy, 
and farther yet again, running 



beyond the place where I stop. 
Where / stop. 

How to put simply that which 
is not a simple thing. ? Solip- 
sism, I suppose, is where we have 
to begin — the notion that nothing 
exists but the self or, at least, that 
we cannot truly be aware of any- 
thing but our own existence and 
experience. I can find, some- 
where, off in Shadow, anything I 
can visualize. Any of us can. This, 
in good faith, does not transcend 
the limits of the ego. It may be 
argued, and in fact has, by most 
of us, that we create the shadows 
we visit out of the stuff of our 
own psyches, that we alone truly 
exist, that the shadows we 
traverse are but projections of our 
own desires. Whatever the 
merits of this argument, and there 
are several, it does go far toward 
explaining much of the family’s at- 
titude toward people, places and 
things outside of Amber. Namely, 
we are toymakers and they, our 
playthings — sometimes danger- 
ously animated, to be sure; but 
this, too, is part of the game. We 
are impresarios by temperament, 
and we treat one another accord- 
ingly. While solipsism does tend 
to leave one sligntly embarassed 
on questions of etiology, one can 
easily avoid the embarassment by 
refusing to admit the validity of 
the questions. Most of us are, as I 
have often observed, almost en- 
tirely pragmatic in the conduct of 
our af&rs. Almost. 

. .Yet, yet there is a disturb- 
ing element in the picture. There 
is a place where the shadows go 
mad. When you purposely 
push yourself through layer after 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



95 




layer of Shadow, surrendering- 
— again, purposely — a piece of 
your understanding everv step of 
the way, you come at ^ast to a 
mad place beyond which you can- 
not go. Why do this? In hope of 
an insight. I’d say, or a new 
game. But when you come to 
this place, as we all have, you 
realize that you have reached the 
limit of Shadow or the end -of 
yourself — synonymous terms, as 
we had always thought. Now, 
though. 

Now I know that it is not so, 
now as I stand, waiting, without 
the Courts of Chaos, telling you 
what it was like, I know that it is 
not so. But I knew well enough 
then, that night, in Tir-na' Nog’tn, 
had known earlier, when I had 
fought the goat-man in the black 
cir(de ofTorraine, had known that 
day in the Lighthouse of Cabra, 
after my escape from tbe 
dungeons of Amber, when I had 
looked upon ruined Camath. I 
knew that that was not all there 
was to it. I knew because I knew 
that the black road ran beyond 
that point. It passed through 
madness into chaos and kept 
going. The things that traveled 
across it came from somewhere, 
but they were not my things. I 
had, somehow, helped to grant 
them this passage, but they did 
not spring from my version of re- 
ality. They were their own, or 
someone else’s — small matter 
there — and they tore holes in that 
small metaphysic we had woven 
over the ages. They had entered 
our preserve, they were not of it, 
they threatened it, they 
threatened us. Fiona and Brand 

96 



had reached beyond everything 
and found something, where none 
of the rest of us had believed any- 
thing to exist. The danger re- 
leased was, on some level, almost 
worth the evidence obtained: we 
were not alone, nor were shadows 
truly our toys. Whatever our rela- 
tionship with Shadow, I could never 
more regard it in the old light. 

. .All because the black road 
headed south and ran beyond the 
end of the world, where I stop. 

Silence and silver. Walking 
away from the rail, leaning on my 
sticK, passing through tne fog- 
spun, mist-woven, moonlight- 
brushed fabric of vision within the 
troubling city. Ghosts. 
Shadows of shadows. Images of 
probability. Might-bes and 
might-have-beens. Probability 
lost. Probability regained. 

Walking, across the promenade 
now. Figures, faces, many of 
them familiar. What are they 
about? Hard to say. Some lips 
move, some faces show 
animation. There are no words 
there for me. I pass among 
them, unnoted. 

There. One such figure. 
Alone, but waiting. Fingers 
unknotting minutes, casting them 
away. Face averted, and I wish 
to see it. A sign that I will or 
should. She sits on a stone 
bench beneath a gnarly tree. 
She gazes in the direction of the 
palace. Her form is quite 
familiar. Approaching, I see 
that it is Lorraine. ^e con- 
tinues to regard a point far 
beyond me, does not hear me say 
that I have avenged her death. 

But mine is the power to be 

GALAXY 




heard here. It hangs in the 
sheathe at my side. 

. .Drawing Grayswandir, I 
raise my blade overhead where 
moonlimt tricks its patterns into a 
kind of motion. I place it on the 
ground between us. 

“Corwin!” 

Her head snaps back, her hair 
rusts in the moonlight, her eyes 
focus. 

“Where did you come from? 
You’re early. .” 

“You wait for me?” 

“Of course. You told me to — ” 

“How did you come to this 
place?” 

“This bench. ?” 

“No. This city.” 

“Amber? I do not under- 
stand. You brought me 
yourself. I — ” 

“Are you happy here? ” 

“You know that I am, so long as 
I am with you.” 

I had not forgotten the even- 
ness of her teeth, the hint of 
freckles beneath the soft light’s 
veil. 

“What happened? It is very 
important. Pretend for a moment 
that I do not know, and tell me 
everything that happened to us 
after the battle of the black circle 
in Lorraine.” 

She frowned. She stood. She 
turned away. 

“We had that argument,” she 
said. “You followed me, drove 
away Melkin and we talked. I saw 
that I was wrong and I went with 
ou to Avalon. There, your 
rother Benedict persuaded you 
to talk with Eric. You were not 
reconciled, but you agreed to a 
truce because of something that 

SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



he told you. He swore not to 
harm you and you swore to. de- 
fend Amber, with Benedict to 
witness both oaths. We remained 
in Avalon while you obtained 
chemicals, and we went to 
another place later, a place where 
you purchased strange weapons. 
We won the battle, but Eric lies 
wounded now.” She stood and 
faced me. “Are you thinking of 
ending the truce? Is that it?” 

I shook my head, and though I 
knew better I reached to embrace 
her. I wanted to hold her, despite 
the fact that one of us did not 
exist, could not exist, when that 
tiny gap of space between our 
skins was crossed, to tell her that 
whatever had happened or would 
happen — 

Tne shock was not severe, but 
it caused me to stumble. I lay 
across Grayswandir. My staff 
had fallen to the grass several 
aces away. Rising to my 
nees, I saw that the color had 
one out of her face her eyes her 
air. Her mouth shaped ghost 
words as her head turned, 
searching. Sheathing Grays- 
wandir, recovering my staff, I 
rose once again. Her seeing 
passed through me and 
focussed. Her face grew 
smooth, she smiled, started 
forward. I moved aside and 
turned, watching her run toward 
the man who approached, seeing 
her clasped in his arms, glimpsing 
his face as he bent it toward her 
own, lucky ghost, silver rose at 
the throat of his garment, kissing 
her, this man I would never 
know, silver on silence, and 
silver. 



97 




Walking away. Not looking 
back. Crossing the prome- 
nade. 

The voice of Random: “Corwin, 
are you all right?” 

“Yes.” 

“Anything interesting happen- 
in§?” 

‘Later, Random.” 

“Sorry.” 

. .And sudden, the gleaming 
stair before the palace grounds. 
Up it, and a turn to the right. 
Slow and easy now, into the 
garden. Ghost flowers throb on 
their stalks all about me, ghost 
shrubs spill blossoms like frozen 
firework displays. Sans colors, 
all. Only the essentials 
sketched in, degrees of luminosity 
in silver the terms of their claim 
on the eye. Only the essentials 
here. Is Tir-na Nog’th a special 
sphere of Shadow in the real 
world, swayed by the promptings 
of the id — a full-sized projective 
test in the sky, perhaps even a 
therapeutic device. ? Despite 
the silver. I’d say, if this is a 
piece of the soul, the night is very 
dark. And silent. 

Walking. By fountains, 
benches, groves, cunning alcoves 
in mazes of hedging. Passing 
along the walks, up an occasions 
step, across small bridges. 
Moving past ponds, among trees, 
by an odd piece of statuary, a 
boulder, a sundial (moondial, 
here?), bearing to my right, pres- 
sing steadily ahead, rounding, 
after a time, the northern end of 
the palace, swinging left then, 
courtyard overhung by balconies, 
ghosts here and there upon them, 
behind them, within. 



Circling around to the rear, just 
to see the back gardens this way, 
again, for they are lovely by nor- 
mal moonlight in the true 
Amber. 

A few more figures, talking, 
standing. No motion but my 
own is apparent. 

. .And feel my self drawn to 
the right. As one should never 
turn down a free oracle, I go. 

. .Toward a mass of high 
hedging, a small open area 
within, if it is not overgrown. 
Long ago there was. 

Two figures, embracing, 
within. They part as I begin to 
turn away. None of my affair, 
but. Deirdre. One of them 
is Deirdre. I know who the 
man will be before he turns. It 
is a cruel joke by whatever pow- 
ers rule that silver, that 
silence. Back, back, away from 
that hedge. Turning, stumbl- 
ing, rising again, going, away, 
now, quickly. 

The voice of Random: “Corwin? 
Are you all right?” 

“Later! Damn it! Later!” 

“It is not too long till sunrise, 
Corwin. I felt I had better remind 
you — ” 

“Consider me reminded!” 

. .Away, now, quickly. 
Time, too, is a dream in Tir-na 
Nog’th. Small comfort, but 
better than none. Quickly, 
now, away, going, again. 

. .Toward the palace, bright 
architecture of the mind or spirit, 
more clearly standing now than 
the real ever did. To judge 
perfection is to render a worthless 
verdict, but I must see what lies 
within. This must be an end of 



98 



GALAXY 




sorts, for I am driven. I had 
not paused to recover my staff 
from vvhere it had fallen this time, 
among the sparkling grasses. I 
know where I must go, what I 
must do. Obvious now, though 
the logic which has seized me is 
not that of the waking mind. 

Hurrying, climbing, up to the 
rearward portal. The sidebiting 
soreness comes home again. 
Across the threshold, in. 

. .Into an absence of star- 
shine and moonlight. The illumi- 
nation is without direction, seem- 
ing almost to drift and to pool, 
aimlessly. Wherever it misses, 
the shadows are absolute, occult- 
ing large sections of room, hall- 
way, closet and stair. 

Among them, through them, 
almost running now. Mono- 
chrome of my home. Apprehen- 
sion overtakes me. The black 
spots seem like holes in this piece 
of reality now. I fear to pass 
too near. Fall in and be 
lost. 

Turning. Crossing. 
Finally. Entering. The 
throne room. Bushels of black- 
ness stacked where my eyes 
would drive down lines of seeing 
to the throne itself . 

There, though, is 

movement. 

A drifting, to my right, as I 
advance. 

A lifting, with the drifting. 

The boots on feet on legs come 
into view as forward pressing I 
near the place’s base. 

Grayswandir comes into my 
hand, finding its way into a patch 
of light, renewing its eyetricKing, 

SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



shapeshifring stretch, acquiring a 
glow of its own. 

I place my left foot on the step, 
rest my left hand on my knee. 
Distracting but bearable, the 
throb of my healing gut. I wait 
for the blackness, the emptiness 
to be drawn, appropriate curtain 
for the theatrics with which I am 
burdened this qight. 

. .And it slides aside, reveal- 
ing a hand, an arm, a shoulder, 
the arm a glinting, metallic thing, 
its planes like the facets of a gem, 
its wrist and elbow wondrous 
weaves of silver cable, pinned 
with flecks of fire, the hand, 
stylized, skeletal, a Swiss toy, a 
mechanical insect, functional, 
deadly, beautiful in its way. 

. .And it slides aside, reveal- 
ing the rest of the man. 

. .Benedict stands relaxed 
beside the throne, his left and 
human hand laid lightly upon 
it. He leans toward the 
throne. His lips are moving. 

. .And it slides aside, reveal- 
ing the throne’s occupant. 

‘Dara!” 

. .Turned toward her right, 
she smiles, she nods to Benedict, 
her lips move. I advance and 
extend Grayswandir till its point 
rests lightly in the concavity be- 
neath her sternum. 

Slowly, quite slowly, she turns 
her head and meets my eyes. 
She takes on color and life. 
Her lips move again, and this 
time her words reach me. 

“What are you?” 

“No. That is my question. You 
answer it. Now.” 

“I am Dara. Dara of Amber, 
Queen Dara. I hold this throne 



99 




by right of blood and conquest. 
Who are you?” 

“Corwin. Also of Amber. Don’t 
move! I did not ask who you 
are — ” 

“Corwin is dead these many 
centuries. I have seen his tomb.” 

“Empty.” 

“Not so. His'body lies within.” 

“Give me your lineage! ” 

Her eyes move to her right, 
where the shade of Benedict still 
stands. A blade has appeared 
in his new hand, seeming almost 
an extension of it, but that he 
holds it loosely, casually. His 
left hand now rests on her 
arm. His eyes seek me back of 
Grayswandir s hilt. Failing, 
they go again to that which is 
visible — Grayswandir — recognizing 
its design. 

“I am the great-granddaughter 
of Benedict and the hellmaid 
Lintra, whom he loved and later 
slew.” Benedict winces at this, 
but she continues, “I never knew 
her. My mother and my mother’s 
mother were born in a place 
where time does not run as in 
Amber. I am the first of my 
mother’s line to bear all the marks 
of humanity. And you. Lord Cor- 
win, are but a ghost from a long 
dead past, albeit a dangerous 
shade. How you came here, I do 
not know. But it was wrong of 
you. Return to your grave. Trou- 
ble not the living.” 

My hand wavers. Grayswan- 
dir strays no more than half an 
inch. Yet that is sufficient. 

Benedict’s thrust is below my 
threshold of perception. His 
new arm drives the new hand that 
holds that blade that strikes 

100 



Grayswandir, as his old arm draws 
his old hand, which has seized 
upon Dara, back across the arm of 
the throne. This subliminal 
impression reaches me moments 
later, as I fall back, cutting air, 
recover and strike an en garde, 
reflexively. It is ridiculous for a 
pair of ghosts to fight. Here, it 
is uneven. He cannot even 
reach me, whereas Grayswandir — 

But no! His blade changes 
hands as he releases Dara and 
pivots, bringing them together, 
old hand and, new. His left wrist 
rotates as he slides it forward and 
down, moving into what would be 
corps a corps, were we two facing 
mortal bodies. For a moment, our 
guards are locked. That moment, 
is enough. 

That gleaming, mechanical 
hand comes forward, a thing of 
moonlight and fire, blackness and 
smoothness, all angles, no curves, 
fingers slightly flexed, palm 
silver-scribbled wi th a half- 
familiar design, comes forward, 
comes forward and catches at my 
throat. 

. .Missing, the fingers catch 
my shoulder and the thumb goes 
hooking — whether for clavicle or 
larynx, I do not know. I throw 
one punch with my left, toward 
his midsection, and there is no- 
thing there. 

The voice of Random: “Gorwin! 
The sun is about to rise! You’ve 
got to come down now!” 

I cannot even answer. A 
second or two and that hand 
would tear away whatever it 
held. That hand. Grays- 
wandir and that hand, which 
strangely resembles it, are the 

GALAXY 




only two things which seem to 
coexist in my world and the city 
of ghosts. 

‘ I see it, Corwin! Pull away and 
reach for me! The Trump — ” 

I spin Grayswandir out of the 
bind and bring it around and 
down in a long slashing arc. 

. .Only a ghost could have 
beaten Benedict or Benedict’s 
ghost with that maneuver. We 
stand too close for him to block 
my blade, but his countercut, per- 
fectly placed, would have re- 
moved my arm, had there been 
an arm there to meet it. 

As there is not, I complete the 
stroke, delivering the blow with 
the full force of my right arm, 
high upon that lethal device of 
moonlight and fire, blackness and 
smoothness, near to the point 
where it is joined with him. 

With an evil tearing at my 
shoulder, the arm comes away 
from Benedict and grows still. 
We both fall. 

“Get up! By the unicorn, Cor- 
win, get up! The sun is rising! 
The city will come apart about 
you!” 

. .The floor beneath me 
wavers to and from a misty trans- 
parency. I glimpse a light-scaled 
expanse of water. I roll to my 
feet, barely avoiding the ghost’s 
rush to clutch at the arm he has 
lost. It clings like a dead para- 
site and my side is hurting 
again. 

. .Suddenly I am heavy and 
the vision of ocean does not fade. 
I begin to sink through the 
floor. Color returns to the 
world, wavering stripes of

floor parts and the Corwin-killing 
gulf is opened. 

I fall. 

“This way, Crowin! Now!” 

. .Random stands on a 
mountaintop and reaches for me. 
I extend my hand.

• • • .And frying pans 
without fires are often far 
between. 

We untangled ourselves and 
rose. I sat down again im- 
mediately, on the bottommost 
stair. I worked the metal hand 
loose from my shoulder — no blood 
there, but a promise of bruises to 
come — then cast it and its arm to 
the ground. The light of early 
morning did not detract from its 
exquisite and menacing appear- 
ance. 

Ganelon and Random stood be- 
side me. 

“You all right, Corwin?” 

“Yeah. Just let me catch my 
breath.” 

“I brought food,” Random said. 
“We could have breakfast right 
here.” 

“Good idea. ” 

' As Random began unpacking 

101 





provisions, Ganelon nudged the 
arm with the toe of his boot. 

“What the hell,” he asked, "is 
that?” 

I shook my head. 

“I lopped it off the ghost of Be- 
nedict, I told him. “For reasons 
I do not unde/stand, it was able 
to reach me.” 

He stooped and picked it up, 
studied it. 

“A lot lighter than I thought it 
would be,” he observed. He 
raked the air with it. “You could 
do quite a job on someone, with a 
hand like that.” 

“I know.” 

He worked the fingers. 

“Maybe the real Benedict could 
use it.” 

“Maybe,” I said. “My feelings 
are quite mixed when it comes to 
offering it to him, but possibly 
you’re right. .” 

“How’s the side?” 

I rpodded it gently. 

“Not especially bad, everything 
considered. I’ll be able to ride 
after breakfast, so long as we take 
it nice and easy.” 

“Good. — Say, Corwin, while 
Random is getting things ready, I 
have a question that may be way 
out of order, but it has been 
bothering me all along. .” 

“Ask it.” 

“Well, let me put it this 
way. I am all for you, or I 
would not be here. I will fight for 
you to have your throne, no mat- 
ter what. But every time talk of 
the succession occurs, someone 
gets angry and breaks it off or the 
subject gets changed. Like Ran- 
dom did, while you were up 
there. I suppose that it is not ab- 

102 



solutely essential for me to know 
the basis of your claim to the 
throne, or that of any of the 
others, but I cannot help being 
curious as to the reasons for all 
the friction.” 

I sighed, then sat silent for a 
time. 

“All right, ” I said, after awhile, 
and then I chuckled. “All right. If 
we cannot agree on these things 
ourselves, I would guess that they 
must seem pretty confused to an 
outsider. Benedict is the eldest. 
His mother was Cymnea. She 
bore Dad two other sons, also- 
— Osric and Finndo. Then — how 
does one put these things? 
— Faiella bore Eric. After that. 
Dad found some defect in 
his marriage with Cymnea and 
had it dissolved — ab initio, as 
they would say in my old 
shadow — from the beginning. 
Neat trick, that. But he was the 
king.” 

“Didn’t that make all of them il- 
legitimate?” 

“Well, it left their status less 
certain. Osric and Finndo were 
more than a little irritated, as I 
understand it, but they died 
shortly thereafter. Benedict was 
either less irritated or more poli- 
tic about the entire affair. He 
never raised a fuss. Dad then 
married Faiella.” 

“And that made Eric legiti- 
mate?” 

“It would have, if he had ack- 
nowledged Eric as his son. He 
treated him as if he were, but he 
never did anything formal in that 
regard. It involved the smoothing 
over process with Cymnea’s fam- 
ily, which had become a bit 

GALAXY 




stronger around that time.” 

“Still, if he treated him as his 
own. .” 

“Ah! But he later did 
acknowledge Llewella formally. 
She was bom out of wedlock, but 
he decided to recognize her, poor 
irl. All of Eric’s supporters hated 
er for its effect on his status. 
Anywa, Faiella was later to be- 
come my mother. I was born 
safely in wedlock, making me the 
first with a clean claim on the 
throne. Talk to one of the others 
and you may get a different line 
of reasoning, fiut those are the 
facts it will nave to be based on. 
Somehow, it does not seem quite 
as important as it once did, 
though, with Eric dead and Be- 
nedict not really interested. 
But that is where I stand.” 

“I see — sort of,” he said. “Just 
one more thing, then. .” 

“What?” 

“Who is next? — if anything were 
to happen to you. ?” 

I shook my head. 

“It gets even more complicated 
there, now. Caine would have 
been next. With him dead, I see 
it as swinging over to Clarissa’s 
brood — the redheads. Bleys 
would have followed, then 
Brand.” 

“Clarissa? What became of your 
mother?” 

“She died in childbirth. 
Deirdre was the child. Dad did 
not remarry for many years after 
mother’s death. When he did, it 
was a redheaded wench from a far 
southern shadow. I never liked 
her. He began feeling the same 
way after a time and started fool- 
ing around again. They had one 

SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



reconciliation after Llewella’s 
birth in Rebma, and Brand was 
the result. When they were fi- 
nally divorced, he recognized 
Llewella to spite Clarissa. At 
least, that is what I think hap- 
pened.” 

“So you are not counting the 
ladies in the succession?” 

“No. They are neither in- 
terested nor fit. If I were though, 
Fiona would precede Bleys and 
Llewella would follow him. 
— After Clarissa’s crowd, it would 
swing over to Julian, Gerard and 
Random, in that order. Excuse 
me — Count Flora before Julian. 
The marriage data is even more 
involved, but no one will dispute 
the final order. Let it go at that.” 
“Gladly,” he said. “So now 
Brand gets it if you die, right?” 
“Well. He is a self-confessed 
traitor and he rubs everybody the 
wrong way. I do not believe the 
rest of them would have him, as 
he stands now.” 

“But the alternative is Julian.” 

I shrugged. 

“The fact that I do not like 
Julian does not make him unfit. 
In fact, he might even be a very 
effective monarch.” 

“So he knifed you for the 
chance to prove it,” Random cal- 
led out. “Come on and eat. ” 

“I still don’t think so,” I said, 
getting to my feet and heading for 
the food. “First, I don’t see now 
he would have gotten to me. Sec- 
ond, it woula have been too 
damned obvious. Third, if I die in 
the near future Benedict will have 
the real say as to the succession. 
Everyone knows that. He’s got 
the seniority, he’s got the wits 



103 




and he’s got the power. He could 
simply sav, for example, ‘The hell 
with ^1 tnis bickering, I am back- 
ing Gerard,’ and that would be 

“What if he decided to reinter- 
ret his own status and take it 
imself? ” Ganelon asked. 

We seated ourselves on the 
ground and took the tin dishes 
Random had Riled. 

“He could have had it long be- 
fore this, had he wanted it,” I 
said. “There are several ways of 
regarding the offspring of a void 
marriage, and the most favorable 
one would be the most likely in 
his case. Osric and Finndo rushed 
to judgment, taking the worst 
view. Benedict knew better. He 
just waited. So. It is possible. 
Unlikely, though. I’d say. 

“Then — in the normal course of 
affairs — if anything happened to 
you, it could still be very much 
up in the air?” 

“Very much.” 

“But why was Caine killed? ” 
Random asked. Then, between 
mouthfuls, he answered his own 
question, “So that when they got 
you, it would swing over to 
Clarissa’s kids immediately. It has 
occurred to me that Bleys is 
probably still living, and he is 
next in line. His body was never 
found. My guess is this: He 
trumped on to Fiona during your 
attack and returned to Shadow to 
rebuild his forces, leaving you to 
what he hoped would be your 
death at the hands of Eric. He is 
finally ready to move again. So 
they killed Caine and tried for 
you. If they are really allied with 
the black-road horde, they could 

104 



have arranged for another assault 
from that quarter. Then he could 
have done the same thing you 
did — arrive at the last hour, turn 
back the invaders and move on 
in. And there he would be, next 
in line and first in force. Simple. 
Except that you survived and 
Brand has been returned. If we 
are to believe Brand’s accusation 
of Fiona — and I see no reason 
why we should not — then it fol- 
lows from their original program. ” 

I nodded. 

“Possibly, ” I said. “I asked 
Brand just those things'. He ad- 
mitted their possibility, but he 
disavowed any knowledge as to 
whether Bleys was still living. 
Personally, I think he was lying. 

“Why? ’ 

“It is possible that he wishes to 
combine revenge for his impris- 
onment and the attempt on his 
life with the removal of the one 
impediment, save for myself, to 
his own succession. I think he 
feels that I will be expended in a 
scheme he is evolving to deal 
with the black road. The destruc- 
tion of his own cabal and the re- 
moval of the road could make him 
look pretty decent, especially after 
all the pennance he has had 
thrust upon him. Then, maybe 
then, he would have a chance — or 
thinks that he would.” 

“Then you think Bleys is still 
living, too?” 

“Just a feeling,” I said. “But 
yes, I do.” 

“What is their strength, any- 
way?” 

“An endorsement of higher 
education, ” I said. “Fiona and 
Brand paid attention to Dworkin 

GALAXY 




while the rest of us were oflF in- 
dulging our assorted passions in 
Shadow. Consequently, they 
seem to have obtained a better 
grasp of principles than we pos- 
sess. They know more about 
Shadow and what lies beyond it, 
more about the Pattern, more 
about the Trumps than we do. 
That is why Brand was able to 
send you his message.” 

“An interesting thought. .” 
Random mused. “Do you think 
they might have disposed of 
Dworkin after they felt they had 
learned enough from him? It 
would certairdy help to keep 
things exclusive, if anything hap- 
pened to Dad.” 

“That thought had not occurred 
to me,” I said. 

And I wondered, could they 
have done something that had af- 
fected his mind? Something that 
left him as he was when last I had 
seen him? If so, were they aware 
that he was possibly still living, 
somewhere? Or might they have 
assumed his total destruction? 

“Yes, an interesting thought,” I 
said. “I suppose that it is possi- 
ble.” 

The sun inched its way upward, 
and the food restored me. No 
trace of Tir-na Nog’th remained in 
the morning’s light. My memories 
of it had already taken on the 
quality of images in a dim mirror. 
Ganelon fetched its only other 
token, the arm, and Random 
packed it away along with the 
dishes. By daylight, the first three 
steps looked less like stairs and 
more like jumbled rock. 

Random gestured with his 
head. 



“Take the same way back?” 

“Yes,” I said, and we mounted. 

We had come by way of a trail 
that wound about Kolvir to the 
south. It was longer but less rug- 
ged than the route across the 
crest. I’d a humor to pamper my- 
self so long as my side protested. 

So we bore to the ri^t, moving 
single file. Random in the lead, 
Ganelon to the rear. The trail ran 
ently upward, then cut back 
own again. The air was cool, and 
it bore the aromas of verdure and 
moist earth, a thing quite unusual 
in that stark place, at that al- 
titude. Straying air currents, I 
reasoned, from the forest far 
below. 

We let the horses pick their 
own casual pace down through 
the dip and up the next rise. As 
we neared its crest. Random’s 
horse whinnied and began to rear. 
He controlled it immediately, and 
I glanced about but saw nothing 
that might have startled it. 

When he reached its summit. 
Random slowed and called back, 
“Take a look at that sunrise now, 
will you?” 

It would have been rather dif- 
ficult to avoid doing so, though I 
did not remark on the fact. Ran- 
dom was seldom given to senti- 
mentality over vegetation, geology 
or illumination. 

I almost drew rein myself as I 
topped the rise, for the sun was a 
fantastic golden ball. It seemed 
half again its normal size, and its 
peculiar coloration was unlike 
anything I remembered having 
seen before. It did marvellous 
things to the band of ocean that 
had come into view above the 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



105 




next rise, and the tints of cloud 
and sky were indeed singular. I 
did not halt, though, for the sud- 
den bri^tness was almost painful. 

“You re right,” I called out, fol- 
lowing him down into the next 
declivity. Behind me, Canelon 
snorted an appreciative oath. 

When I had blinked away the 
aftereffects of that display I 
noticed that the vegetation was 
heavier than I had remembered 
in this little pocket in the sky. I 
had thought there were several 
scrubby trees and some patches of 
lichen, but there were actually 
several dozen trees, larger than I 
recalled, and greener, with a 
clutch of grasses here and there 
and a vine or two softening the 
outlines of the rocks. However, 
since my return I had only passed 
this way after dark. And now that 
I thought of it, it was probably 
the source of the aromas that had 
come to me earlier. 

Passing through, it seemed that 
the little hollow was also wider 
than I recalled it to be. By the 
time we had crossed and were as- 
cending once more, f was certain 
of it. 

“Random,” I called out, “has 
this placed changed recently?” 
“Hard to say,” he answered. 
“Eric didn’t let me out much. It 
seems to have grown up a bit.” 

“It seems bigger — ^wider.” 

“Yes, it does. I had thought 
that that was just my imagina- 
tion.” 

When we reached the next 
crest I was not dazzled again be- 
cause the sun was blo^ed by 
foliage. The area ahead of us con- 
tained many more trees than the 

106 



one we had just departed — and 
they were larger and closer to- 
gether. We drew rein. 

“I don’t remember this,” he 
said. “Even passing through at 
night, it would have registered. 
We must have taken a wrong 
turn.” 

“I don’t see how. Still, we 
know about where we are. I 
would rather go ahead than go 
back and start again. We should 
keep aware of conditions around 
Amber, anyway.” 

“True.” 

He headed down toward the 
wood. We followed. 

“It’s kind of unusual, at this 
altitude — a growth like this,” he 
called back. 

“There also seems to be a lot 
more soil than I recall.” 

“I believe you are right.” 

The trail curved to the left as 
we entered among the trees. I 
could see no reason for this devia- 
tion from the direct route. We 
stayed with it, however, and it 
added to the illusion of distance. 
After a few moments, it swung 
suddenly to the right again. The 
prospect on cutting back was 
peculiar. The trees seemed even 
taller and were now so dense as 
to puzzle the eye that sought 
their penetration. When it turned 
once more it broadened, and the 
way was straight for a great dis- 
tance ahead. Too great, in fact. 
Our little dell just wasn’t that 
wide. 

Random halted again. 

“Damn it, Corwin! This is 
ridiculous! ” he said. “You are not 
playing games, are you?” 

‘I couldn’t if I would,” I said. 

GALAXY 




“I have never been able to man- 
ipulate Shadow anywhere on Kol- 
vir. There isn’t supposed to be 
any to work with here.” 

“That has always been my un- 
derstanding, too. Amber casts 
Shadow but is not of it. I don’t 
like this at all. What do you say 
we turn back?” 

“I’ve a feeling we might not be 
able to retrace our way,” I said. 
“There has to be a reason for this, 
and I want to know it.” 

“It occurs to me that it might 
be some sort of a trap.” 

“Even so,” I said. 

He nodded and we rode on, 
down that shaded way, under 
trees grown now more stately. 
The wood was silent about us. 
The ground remained level, the 
trail strai^t. Half-consciously, we 
pushed the horses to a greater 
pace. 

About five minutes passed be- 
fore we spoke again. Then Ran- 
dom said, “Corwin, this can’t be 
Shadow.” 

“Why not?” 

"I have been trying to influence 
it and nothing happens. Have you 
tried?” 

“No.” 

“Why don’t you?” 

“All right.” 

A rock could jut beyond the 
coming tree, a Morning Glory 
twine, and bell within that 
shrubby stand. There ought a 
patch of sky come clear, a wispy 
cloud upon it. Then let there 
be a fallen limb, a stair of fungus 
up its side. A scummed over 
puddle. A frog. Falling 
feather, drifting seed. A limb 
that twists just so. Another 

SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



trail upon our way, fresh-cut, 
deep-marked, past the place the 
feather should have fallen. 

“No good,” I said. 

“If it is not Shadow, what is it?” 
"Something else, of course.” 

He shook his head and checked 
again to see that his blade was 
loose in its scabbard. Automati- 
cally, I did the same. Moments 
later, I heard Ganelon’s make a 
small clicking noise behind me. 

Ahead, the trail began to nar- 
row, and shortly thereafter it 
commenced to wander. We were 
forced to slow our pace once 
again, and the trees pressed 
nearer with branches sweeping 
lower than at any time before. 
The trail became a path. It jog- 
ged, it curved, it gave a final twist 
and then quit. 

Random ducked a limb, then 
raised his hand and halted. We 
came up beside him. For as far as 
I could see ahead there was no 
sign of the trail’s picking up again. 
Looking back, I failed to locate 
any sign of it either. 

“Suggestions,” he said, “are 
now in order. We do not know 
where we have been or where we 
are going, let alone where we are. 
My suggestion is the hell with 
curiosity. Let’s get out of here the 
fastest way we know how.” 

“The Trumps? ” Ganelon asked. 
“Yes. What do you say, Cor- 
win?” 

“Okay. I don’t like it either, 
and I can’t think of anything bet- 
ter to try. Go ahead. ” 

“Who should I try for?” he 
asked, producing his deck and 
uncasing it. “Gerard?” 

“Yes. 



107 




He shuffled through his cards, 
located Gerard’s, stared at it. We 
stared at him. Time went its way. 

“I can’t seem to reach him,” he 
finally announced. 

“Try Benedict.” 

“Okay.” 

Repeat performance. No con- 
tact. 

““Try Deirdre,” I said, drawing 
forth my own deck and searching 
out her Trump. ‘“I’ll join you. We 
will see whether it makes a diffier- 
ence with two of us trying.” 

And again. And again. 

““Nothing, ” I said, after a long 
effort. 

Random shook his head. 

“Did you notice anything un- 
usual about your Trumps?” he 
asked. 

““Yes,, but I don’t know what it 
is. They do seem different. ’’ 

““Mine seem to have lost that 
quality of coldness they once pos- 
sessed,” he said. 

I shuffled mine slowly. I ran 
my fingertips across them. 

“ Yes, you are right,” I said. 
“That’s it. But let us try again. 
Say, Flora. ” 

“Okay.” 

The results were the same. And 
with Llewella. And Brand. 

““Any idea what could be 
wrong?” Random asked. 

““Not the slightest. They 
couldn’t all be blocking us. They 
couldn’t all be dead. — Oh, I sup- 
pose they could. But it is highly 
unlikely. Something seems to 
have affected the Trumps them- 
selves, is what it is. And I never 
knew of anything could do that.” 

“Well, they are not guaranteed 
one hundred percent, ’ Random 



said, “according to the manufac- 
turer.” 

“What do you know?” 

He chuckled. 

“You never forget the day you 
come of age and walk the Pat- 
tern,” he said. “I remember it as 
though it were just last year. 
When I had succeeded — all 
flushed with excitement, with 
glory — Dworkin presented me my 
first set of Trumps and instructed 
me in their use. I distinctly recall 
asking him whether they worked 
everywhere. And I remember his 
answer: “No,” he’d said. “But they 
should serve in any place you will 
ever be.’ He never much liked 
me, you know.” 

“But did you ask him what he 
had meant by that?” 

“Yes, and he said, “I doubt that 
you will ever achieve a state 
where they will fail to serve you. 
Why don’t you run along now?’ 
And I did. I was anxious to go 
play with the Trumps all by my- 
self.” 

“Achieve a state’? He didn’t 
say “reach a place’?” 

“No. I have a very good mem- 
ory for certain things.” 

“Peculiar — though not much 
help that I can see. Smacks of the 
metaphysical.” 

“I’d wager Brand would know.” 
“I’ve a feeling you’re right, for 
all the good that does us. ” 

“We ought to do something 
other than discuss metaphysics, ’ 
Ganelon commented. “If you can’t 
manipulate Shadow and you can’t 
work the Trumps, it would seem 
that the next tning to do is de- 
termine where we are. And then 
go looking for help. ” 



108 



GALAXY 




I nodded. 

“Since we are not in Amber, I 
think it is safe to assume that we 
are in Shadow — a very special 
place, quite near to Amber, since 
the changeover was not abrupt. In 
that we were transported without 
active cooperation on our part, 
there had to be some agency and 
presumably some intent behind 
the maneuver. If it is going to at- 
tack us, now is as good a time as 
any. If there is something else it 
wants, then it is going to have to 
show us, because we aren’t even 
in a |)osition to make a good 
guess. ’ 

“I propose we wait. I don’t see 
any value in wandering about, los- 
ing ourselves further.” 

“I seem to remember your once 
telling me that adjacent shadows 
tend to be somewhat congruent,” 
Ganelon said. 

“Yes, I probably did. So what?” 
“Then, if we are as near to 
Amber as you suppose, we need 
but ride toward the rising sun to 
come to a spot that parallels the 
city itself” 

‘It is not quite that simple. But 
supposing it were, what good 
would it do us?” 

“Perhaps the Trumps would 
function again at the point of max- 
imum congruity. ” 

Random looked at Ganelon, 
looked at me. 

“That may be worth trying,” he 
said. “What have we got to lose?” 
“Whatever small orientation we 
still possess,” I said. “Look, it is 
not a bad idea. If nothing de- 
velops here, we will try it. How- 
ever, looking back, it seems that 
the road behind us closes in di- 

SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



rect proportion to the distance we 
advance. We are not simply mov- 
ing in space. Under these circum- 
stances, I am loathe to wander 
until I am satisfied that we have 
no other option. If someone de- 
sires our presence at a particular 
location it is up to him now to 
phrase the invitation a little more 
legibly. We wait.” 

They both nodded. Random 
began to dismount, then froze, 
one foot in the stirrup, one on the 
ground. 

"... .After all these years,” he 
said, and, “I never really believed 
it. ” 

“What is it?” I whispered. 

“The option,” he said, and he 
mounted again. 

H e persuaded his horse to 
move very slowly, forward. I fol- 
lowed, and a moment later I 
glimpsed it, white as I had seen it 
in the Grove, standing, half-hid, 
amid a clump of ferns: the un- 
icorn. 

It turned as we moved, and 
seconds later flashed ahead, to 
stand, partly concealed once more 
by the trunks of several trees. 

“I see it!” Ganelon whispered. 
“To think there really is such a 
beast. Your family’s emblem, 
isn’t it?” 

“Yes.” 

“A good sign. I’d say. ” 

I did not answer, but followed, 
keeping it in sight. That it was 
meant to be followed, I did not 
doubt. 

It had a way of remaining partly 
concealed the entire while- 
— looking out from behind some- 
thing, passing from cover to 
cover, moving with an incredible 



109 




swiftness when it did more, avoid- 
ing open areas, favoring glade and 
shade. We followed, deeper and 
deeper into the wood which had 
given up all semblance of any- 
thing to be found on Kolvir’s 
slopes. It resembled Arden now, 
more than anything else near 
Amber, as the ground was rela- 
tively level and the trees grew 
more and more stately. 

An hour’d passed. I’d guessed, 
and another’d followed it, before 
we came’ to a small, clear stream 
and the unicorn turned and 
headed up it. As we rode along 
the bank. Random commented, 
“This is starting to look sort of 
familiar.” 

“Yes,” I said, “but only sort of 
I can’t quite say why.” 

“Nor I.” 

We entered upon a slope 
shortly thereafter, and it grew 
steeper before very long. The 
going became more difficult for 
the horses, but the unicorn ad- 
justed its pace to accommodate 
them. The ground became rock- 
ier, the trees smaller. The stream 
curved in its splashing course. I 
lost track of its twists and turns, 
but we were finally nearing the 
top of the small mount up which 
we had been traveling. 

We achieved a level area and 
continued along it toward the 
wood from which the stream is- 
sued. At this point, I caught an 
oblique view — ahead and to the 
right, through a place where the 
land fell away — of an icy blue sea, 
quite far below us. 

“Were pretty high up,” Gane- 
lon said. “It seemed like lowland, 
but — ”

“The Grove of the Unicorn! ” 
Random interrupted. “That’s what 
it looks like! See!” 

Nor was he incorrect. Ahead 
lay an area strewn with boulders. 
In their midst a spring uttered 
the stream we followed. This 
place was larger and more lush, 
its situation incorrect in terms of 
any internal compass. Yet the 
similarity had to be more than 
coincidental. The unicorn mounted 
the rock nearest the spring, looked 
at us, then turned away. It might 
have been staring down at the 
ocean. 

Then, as we continued, the 
grove, the unicorn, the trees 
about us, the stream beside us, 
took on an unusual clarity, all, as 
though each were radiating some 
special illumination, causing it to 
quiver with the intensity of its 
color while at the same time wav- 
ering, slightly, just at the edges of 
perception. "This produced, in me, 
an incipient feeling like the be- 
ginning of the emotional accom- 
paniment to a hellride. 

Then, then and then, with each 
stride of my mount, something 
went out of the world about us. 
An adjustment in the relationships 
of objects suddenly occurred, 
eroding my sense of depth, de- 
stroying perspective, rearranging 
the di^lay of articles within my 
field of vision, so that everything 
presented its entire outer surface 
without simultaneously appearing 
to occupy an increased area: 
angles predominated, and relative 
sizes seemed suddenly ridiculous. 
Random’s horse reared and 
neighed, massive, apocalyptic, in- 
stantly recalling Guernica to my 

GALAXY 




mind. And to my distress, I saw 
that we ourselves had not been 
untouched by the phenomenon- 
— but that Random, struggling with 
his mount, and Canelon, still man- 
aging to control Kiredrake, had, like 
everything else, been transfigured 
by this Cubist dream of space. 

But Star was a veteran of many 
a hellride; Firedrake, also, had 
been through a lot. We clung to 
them and felt the movements that 
we could not accurately guage. 
And Random succeeded, at last, 
in imposing his will upon his 
mount, though the prospect con- 
tinued to alter as we advanced. 

Light values shifted next. The 
sky grew black, not as night, hut 
like a flat, non-reflecting surface. 
So did certain vacant areas be- 
tween objects. Tlie only light left 
in the world seemed to originate 
from things themselves, and all of 
it was gradually bleached. Various 
intensities of white emerged from 
the planes of existence, and brigh- 
test of all, immense, awful, the 
unicorn suddenly reared, pawing 
at the air, filling perhaps ninety 
percent of creation with what be- 
came a slow motion gesture I 
feared would annihilate us if we 
advanced another pace. 

Then there was only the light. 

Then absolute stillness. 

Then the light was gone and 
there was nothing. Not even 
blackness. A gap in existence, 
which might have lasted an in- 
stant or an eternity. 

Then the blackness returned, 
and the light. Only they were re- 
versed. Light filled the inter- 
stices, outlining voids that must 
be objects. This first sound that 

SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



I heard was the rushing of water, 
and I knew somehow that we 
were halted beside the spring. 
The first thing that I felt was 
Star’s quivering. Then I smelled 
the sea. 

Then the Pattern came into 
view, or a distorted negative of 
it. 

I leaned forward and more light 
leaked around the edges of things. 
I leaned back; it went away. For- 
ward again, this time farther than 
before. 

The light spread, introduced 
various ^ades of gray into the 
scheme of things. With my knees 
then, gently, I suggested that Star 
advance. 

With each pace, something re- 
turned to the world. Surfaces, 
textures, color. 

Behind me, I heard the others 
begin to follow. Below me, the 
Pattern surrendered nothing of its 
mystery, but it acquired a context 
which, by degress, found its place 
within the larger reshaping of the 
world about us. 

Continuing downhill, a sense of 
depth reemerged. The sea, now 
plainly visible ofiF to the right, un- 
derwent a presumably purely op- 
tical separation from the sky, with 
which it seemed momentarily to 
have been joined in some sort of 
Urmeer of the waters above and 
the waters helaw. Unsettling 
upon reflection, but unnoted 
wnile in effect. We were heading 
down a steep, rocky incline, 
which seemed to have taken its 
beginning at the rear of the grove 
to which the unicorn had led us. 
Perhaps a hundred meters below 
us was a perfectly level area 



111 




which appeared to be solid, un- 
fractured rock — roughly oval in 
shape, a couple hundred meters 
across its major axis. The slope 
down which we rode swung off to 
the left and returned, describing a 
vast arc, a parenthesis, half- 
cupping the smooth shelf. Beyond 
its rightward jutting there was 
nothing — that is to say, the land 
feel away in steep descent toward 
the sea. 

And, continuing, all three di- 
mensions reasserted themselves 
once more, in proper fashion. The 
sun was that great orb of molten 
gold we had seen earlier. The sky 
was a deeper blue than that of 
Amber, and there were no clouds 
in it. The sea was a matching 
blue, unspecked by sail or island. 
I saw no birds, and I heard no 
sounds other than our own. An 
enormous silence lay upon this 
place, this day. In the bowl of my 
suddenly clear vi.sion, the Pattern 
at last achieved its disposition 
upon the surface below. I thought, 
at first, that it was inscribed in 
the rock, but as we drew nearer I 
saw that it was contained within 
it — gold-pink swirls, like veining 
in an exotic marble, natural- 
seeming despite the obvious pur- 
pose to the design. 

I drew rein and the others 
came up beside me. Random to 
my right, Ganelon to my left. 

We regarded it in silence for a 
long while. A dark, rough-edged 
smudge had obliterated an area of 
the section immediately beneath 
us, running from its outer rim to 
the center. 

“You know,” Random finally 
said, “it is as if someone had 

112 



shaved the top off Kolvir, cutting 
at about the level of the 
dungeons. ” 

“Yes,” I said. 

“Then — looking for 

congruence — that would be about 
where our own Pattern lies.” 

“Yes,” I said again. 

”... .And that blotted area is 
to the south, from whence comes 
the black road.” 

I nodded slowly, as the under- 
standing arrived and forged itself 
into a certainty. 

“What does it mean?” he asked. 
“It seems to correspond to the 
true state of affairs, but beyond 
that I do not understand its sig- 
nificance. Why have we been 
brought here and shown this 
thing?” 

“It does not correspiond to the 
true state of affairs,” I said. “It is 
the true state of affairs.” 

Ganelon turned toward us. 

“On that shadow earth we 
visited — ^where you had spent so 
many years — I heard a poem 
about two roads that diverged in a 
wood,” he said. “It ends, T took 
the one less traveled by, and that 
has made all the difference.’ 
When I heard it, I thought of 
something you had once said — ‘All 
roads lead to Amber’ — and I won- 
dered then, as I do now, at the 
difference the choice may make, 
despite the end’s apparent in- 
evitability to those of your blood.” 

“You know?” I said. “You un- 
derstand?” 

“I think so.” 

He nodded, then pointed. 

“That is the real Amber down 
there, isn’t it?” 

“Yes,” I said. “Yes, it is.”

The room looked quite com- 
fortable , when they brought 
McGinny in and left him alone. 
He had seen pictures, and knew 
what it was. But in his guts he 
could not believe that it was a 
cell.' 

It didn’t look like a cell. It 
didn’t taste like a cell, or feel like 
one, but most of all it didn’t look 
like one. McGinny had been in 
jail once before, in this same 
county, and the cell then had 
borne all the classic hallmarks: 
bars, mildewed concrete walls, 
barred windows, an absurdly large 
look, and miserably inadequate 
sanitary provisions consisting of a 
seatless toilet which stubbornly 
refused to flush and a badly- 
cracked sink which exuded 
brown, rusty water. 

But then, that had been so long 
ago that the charge for which 
McGinny had done time was pos- 
session of marijuana. That statue, 
while it still existed, had not been 
enforced in over ten years. 

And in the meantime, prisons 
had changed. They had had to, of 
course. The Attica Uprising and 
the Tombs Rebellion, the Joliet 
Massacre and the Battle of New 
Alcatraz had been unmistakable 
signs that the traditional approach 
to penology was obsolete. A crim- 
inal population approaching thirty 
percent of the total simply could 
not be herded together and kept 
safely subjugated without the very 
sort of brutalization which an in- 

114 



formed public would no longer 
tolerate. 

But what if they were not 
herded together? 

So it was that the room which 
met McGinny’s eyes now was in 
appearance a pleasant, modestly 
appointed studio apartment — ^with 
a few anomalies. The convict sea- 
ted himself in a remarkably 
comfortable, high-backed psuedo- 
leather armchair, padded with 
God alone knew what, and 
surveyed the unit which would be 
his universe until the time-lock on 
the room’s only door ran out, ten 
years from now. Lookit all the 
cubic, he told himself wonder- 
ingly. Maybe this wouldn’t be too 
bad after all. 

The time-lock itself, not un- 
naturally, was the first thing that 
held his eye. It was set just below 
the apparently open window 
which was cut into the door of his 
cell. All that faced on his side of 
the door was an inverted triangu- 
lar plate with rounded corners, 
small horizontal grooved slots in 
each corner. The overall effect 
was damnably like a skull. 

“Pleased to meet ya,” McGinny 
told it, returning its sour grin. 

The window above the plate 
measured about three by three, 
and appeared empty of glass. So 
did the window on the opposite 
wall behind McGinny, but both 
were in fact enclosed with a 
synthetic material (trade-named 
“Nothing”) which was so transpar- 

GALAXY 




ent as to appear invisible. It could 
not break, crack or get dirty. The 
second window looked out on a 
small courtyard, pleasantly land- 
scaped with ferns and lush grass- 
es, bordered by three fifteen- 
story wings just like the one 
which held McGinny’s cell. The 
seven hundred and fifty windows 
of each were opaque, and 
McGinny knew that his too 
seemed opaque from the outside. 
He sighed. 

To his left was a bed, consisting 
of a mattress on top of a sealed 
box-spring which was clamped to 
the floor. Although the room’s 
climate-control system made 
bedclothes superfluous, the 
penologists had been thoughtful 
enough to realize that a man (or 
woman) felt better with something 
over him as he slept. Hence they 
proved a sheet — made of paper. 
Above the bed were two horizon- 
tal slits, about a half-inch thick 
each. The upper one would dis- 
pense either paper sheets or 
paper clothes. It was activated by 
placing a used sheet or garment 
in the lower slot, which led to an 
incinerator somewhere in the 
bowels of the prison. Two pillows 
lay on the bed, each a featureless 
sponge. 

Filling the space between the 
head of the bed and the corner of 
the room was a closet without a 
door. It had no transversing pole 
from which to suspend hangers, 
nor did it have hangers. Instead, 



suits of paper clothing — there 
were four of them — hung from 
small extrusions of plasteel high 
on the rear wall of the closet. 

In the opposite corner, behind 
McGinny and to the right, was a 
spacious desk with voicewriter 
and rawing pencils. Above the 
desk was a reader which would 
display any book requested, page 
by page, so long as it was stored 
in the prison’s central computer. 
Much of the fiction available was 
speculative, the authorities having 
decided that it would be all right 
to allow prisoners some form of 
escape. (McGinny knew that 
lately, the majority of science- 
fiction writers were ex-criminals, 
some of whose output was quite 
disturbing. Or perhaps that was 
not a new development.) 

To the left of the desk was a 
quadio console, also computer- 
supplied, its four speakers rep- 
resented by darker areas at four 
corners of the ceiling. Available 
tapes ranged from classical 
through rock to flash, with side- 
trips into gregorian and neojazz. 
The console was nearly feature- 
less: one spoke one’s choice and 
selected tone and volume with 
simple slide switches. In appear- 
ance, therefore, the console re- 
sembled a washing machine with 
two small horns. 

Directly adjacent to the quadio 
was the Automat: an equally large 
cube, with a serving platform let 
into its front and small slots on 



NOBODY LIKES TO BE LONELY 



115 




either side which dispensed rub- 
ber cutlery. It too was voice- 
activated, and was fed through 
the floor from a master unit which 
supplied the Automat with raw 
materials. Save for the absence of 
a slot into wKich to deposit one’s 
quarters, it was identical to the 
Automats to be found on the 
average street corner — from 
McGinny’s angle of vision at least. 
From the other end of the room 
one could have seen the unmis- 
takable, time-honored shape of a 
toilet bowl, let into the Automat’s 
left side. It drained to the prison’s 
basement, where paper and waste 
were filtered out and the remain- 
der routed to the master food unit. 
This saved the taxpayers millions of 
dollars annually. 

McGinny snorted, ceased his 
inventory of the room and rose 
from his chair. He went to the 
small sink on the right of the cell 
door and regarded himself in its 
“mirror,” a glassless reflective sur- 
face. As McGinny was one of 
many who had elected to inhibit 
his beard, there was no shaving 
unit next to the mirror; his hair 
would simply have to grow for the 
next ten years, or until he became 
sick enough to warrant the cutting 
open of the time-lock to permit a 
doctor to attend him. The doctor 
played a lot of golf 

Familiar, coarse features stared 
back at McGinny, restoring his 
confidence. His head was large, 
with a cap of wiry brown curls rest- 

116 



ing on elongated ears. His eyes 
were set close against a blunt 
nose, and his overfull lower lip 
gave him a pouting, petulant ex- 
pression. As he saw again the 
room whose reflection surrounded 
his own, the pout became almost 
a sneer. These were the most 
spacious and luxurious quarters he 
had ever inhabited — few in the 
overcrowded world of 2007 had it 
so good. 

Ten years? he thought cheer- 
fully. I’ll do it standing on my 
head. Elbow room, privacy, food 
cooked for me. He frowned. 
Sure will miss beer, though. And 
the ferns. His contentment begin- 
ning to fade, he returned to the 
armchair and dropped heavily into 
it. He found his gaze fixed on the 
window set in the cell door. It 
was strange — the window on the 
opposite wall looked out on open 
space, this one onto a plasteel 
corridor. And yet the exterior 
window gave a view of a false 
freedom, sculpted to make 
McGinny and other thousands 
feel better. In the corridor, men 
walked. Somehow, freedom was 
that way. 

He shifted, scratched his crotch 
and considered the quadio. It 
seemed to him that his first 
choice in this cell was a significant 
event, demanding contemplation. 
He imagined himself ten years 
hence, narrating his prison saga to 
an enraptured fern with eyes like 
saucers, saying, “And do you 



GALAXY 




know what the first thing I played 
in that taken place was?” This’d 
better be good; he’d hate to have 
to lie to her. 

After a time he addressed the 
quadio. The room filled with the 
sound of a frenzied 4/4 piano solo 
from Leon Russell’s legendary last 
album, Live At Luna City. Bass 
and moog came in together as the 
Master of Space and Time hurled 
his anthem: 

“I’m just tryin to stay ’live-and 
keep mah sideburns too." 

Legs trembling, vaguely enjoy- 
ing the play of cool air across his 
sweat-sheened, slender body, 
Solomon Orechal lay in the utter 
relaxation called afterglow and 
surveyed his bedroom. In so 
doing, he also surveyed his dining 
room, his living room, his kitchen 
and his car — all at the same time. 

He sighed, for perhaps the 
dozenth time that day; just as, in 
fact, he had sighed with an almost 
rhythmic regularity on every day 
since he had first moved into his 
own Mome, from the comparative 
spaciousness of his parents’ fish- 
and-see apartment. As the popu- 
lar name indicated, a good effi- 
ciency was hard to find these 
days, but the Orechal ancestral 
apt (the building dated all the way 
back to 1957) had been in family 
possession since before the Hous- 
ing Riots — as the axe-scar and 
single bullet-hole in the door at- 
tested. Solomon had told himself 



often in the last two years that he 
had been a fool to strike out on 
his own. But the lure of adven- 
ture and the challenge of living 
wherever he could find a parking 
space had been enough to pry 
him from the four-and-a-half-room 
home of his youth. 

Besides, it was awkward, bring- 
ing your girlfriends into the 
bathroom to be alone. 

Apropos of which; 

It's very strange, thought Sol- 
omon. I know just what she’s 
going to say now. 

“Sol, why can’t we do the Truth 
Dope?” 

. .and yet there’s nothing deja 
vu about it. 

Beside him on the narrow bed, 
Barbara raised on one elbow, 
half-leaned across him. Sleepily, 
earnestly, she brushed the hair 
out of his eyes and repeated, 
“Why won’t you do Truth with 
me, lover?” 

. .even down to the soft but 
oh so insistent tone of voice, the 
way she lets her left breast brush 
me; and it’s just nothing at all like 
deja vu. 

She was still talking, and there 
was that in her voice which acts 
directly on the glands, but he was 
miles ahead of her, his attention 
two levels removed, contemplat- 
ing the frustration of Moebius’s 
Band with what seemed a poig- 
nant bitterness. Vaguely, he mon- 
itored the persuasions and impor- 
tunities, dropping a grunt here 



NOBODY LIKES TO BE LONELY 



117 




and there and looking impassive, 
until he heard the line he had 
been patiently waiting for. 

. .how,” she was saying, 
timidly and inevitably, “can I help 
but think you’re afraid of the 
Truth?” 

His timing was magnificent. 

“Afraid of the truth? ” he asked 
quietly, paused. “What we just 
did. .wasn’t that the truth?” He 
brushed his fingertips along the 
underside of her belly, and she 
shivered. “Are you suggesting 
that that wasn’t real? That we 
were\just/ucktng? Because it sure 
seemd to me that we were making 
love. Maybe I was wrong.” 

He had her now, he knew it 
from the look on her face, but 
somehow he couldn’t summon up 
the old elation, the sense of 
triumph. Mechanically, he moved 
in for the coup-de-grace: now that 
you’ve stirred up the emotions, 
throw in a little pseudologic and 
you’re home free. 

“You know why I don’t do 
Truth Dope, man. I’ve told you a 
dozen times. I’m not afraid of the 
truth, Tm afraid of the dope.” 

She made one last try. “But 
Sol. .” 

“Now don’t start. Barb. We’ve 
been through this, kark it. There’s 
a mountain of evidence for each 
side, just like there always is 
when a new drug comes out. The 
law says it plays hob with your 
motivations, and the heads say it 
clears your vision. The law says it 



rots your body, and the heads say 
it’s a lie. You know what hap- 
pened with pot. ” (It hadn’t been 
until 1986 that it was proven that 
marijuana could cause tuber- 
culosis. No real problem, as they 
had TB licked by that time — one 
shot at 12 and you couldn’t get it 
if you tried — but it was too late 
for an awful lot of smokers who 
had thought that all the evidence 
was in by 1975.) “I lost my 
mother to TB, and I plan for the 
rest of my life to take the conser- 
vative opinion wherever possible. 
No thanks. Barb. I’ll take my 
Truth the sloppy, human way, 
through inference and deduction. 
Maybe I’ll be wrong a lot more 
often. .but maybe Tll have a lot 
more often to be wrong in. 

“Besides, I don’t need any 
proof that you love me — even 
though you’re trying to get me to 
do something I don’t think is safe, 
to reassure you. Things like just 
happened here a couple of 
minutes ago are all the ‘proof I 
need.” 

There was, of course, nothing 
she could say to that, and she 
even apologized, but somehow 
even as he mounted her to prove 
again the depth of his love by the 
strength of his hips he knew that 
the subject wa not closed, and 
that someday she would back him 
into a corner he couldn’t talk his 
way out of, and on that day they 
would share the drug that made 
dissembly impossible, and she 



118 



GALAXY 




would leave him, just like all the 
others. 

He moaned, but she misunder- 
stood and held him tighter. 

Mcginny tried for the fifth 
time to cut the leathery soyburger 
with his rubber fork. This time 
the disposable plate danced on 
the serving platform and he 
nearly lost the meal entirely. He 
swore a hideous oath and flung 
the fork angrily from him, but 
with the blind malignance that in- 
animate objects display when a 
man is in a towering rage, it 
bounced from the plasteel wall 
and dropped with an absurdly 
loud, high splash into the toilet. 

He rose quickly, cursing with a 
steady, monotonous rhythm. 
Taken stuff tastes enough like 
rubber already, he thought sav- 
agely, plunging his thick hand 
into the bowl. He was just too 
late to save the fork; the cell’s de- 
signers had reasoned that a flusing 
mechanism could fail — a serious 
calamity in a time-locked room- 
— and so that bowl simply emp- 
tied itself constantly, at a gentle 
speed which McGinny had not 
quite beaten. 

Swearing louder now, he 
straightened and walked to the 
sink to wash his hands. He could 
not for the life of him understand 
why he felt that the water there 
would be any cleaner than that 
which laved the bowl, and it irri- 
tated him immensely. 



Of course he burned his hands. 
But by that time the anger had 
reached the point from which one 
either tremblingly descends, or 
begins throwing things. He had 
few things to throw, and none he 
could spare. He counted to ten, 
then chanted Om Mani Padme 
Hum, and gradually the black 
rage subsided, at least to the 
point where he could see through 
the red haze. 

Make the karkin silverware 
rubber so we can’t snuff ourselves, 
he thought, and look how much 
good it does. I’m really filled with 
the joy of livin’ now. 

Finally he walked back to the 
automat, sat down in the desk 
chair which stood before it, and 
picked the soyburger from the 
plate on the serving platform. 

It was cold. 

“GodDAMNit,” he exploded. 
“Sunnabitchin’ machine s’posta 
keep the taken stuff hot, just my 
fuckin’ luck to get the one don’t 
work for TEN TAKEN YEARS!” 

There was nothing for it; the 
soyburger was all he would get 
until tomorrow morning. Growl- 
ing, he raised it to his mouth and 
ripped off a piece with his teeth. 

“Hi there.” 

He whirled, his hand absurdly 
cocking the soyburger like a 
weapon. There in the window of 
the cell door, above the skull-like 
time-lock, was a face. A person! 

McGinny ran to the door, fling- 
ing the soyburger into a comer. 



NOBODY LIKES TO BE LONELY 



119 




“Hello!” he shouted, and then 
pulled to a halt before the door, 
suddenly embarassed. They 
looked at each other for a while, 
McGinny seeing a yong kid, 
maybe twenty, with long blonde 
hair and a Fu Manchu mustache, 
looks like one o’ them Trippies, oh 
Jesus I hope he likes to talk. 

“What are you in for?” 

“Embezzlement,” McGinny 
said automatically, a million ques- 
tions that he could not form coh- 
erently enough to ask buzzing in 
his brain. 

“Oh,” said the youth, adjusting 
a uniform cap on his shaggy head. 
He seemed somehow just slightly 
disappointed. “I guess that must 
be pretty interesting stuff, em- 
bezzlement. I get to talk to all 
kinds of interesting people on this 
job. Once. .once I talked to a 
rapist.” 

He almost seemed to be licking 
his lips, but McGinny was beyond 
noticing. He managed to stam- 
mer, “Hey, look, buddy. 
what. .1 mean, who are you? 
What are you doing here? How 
often do you come around? 
What. .hey, how come I can even 
hear you in here?” 

The kid chuckled. “They’ve got 
a two-way sound system on the 
door, man. Didn’t you know? Lis- 
ten, don’t freak. I’m, like, the 
guard. You didn’t think they’d 
leave you alone with nobody to 
check on you, did you? Suppose 
you conked?” 

120 



“But,” McGinny said, “. .1 
mean, do you come around alot? 
Can you stay a while and talk?” 

“Oh sure, ” the kid assured him. 
“That’s why I took this job, man. 
I’m into people, where they’re at, 
like. All I have to do is walk 
around and talk to interesting 
people, and I only gotta cover fif- 
teen guys a day. See, if you want 
to know the truth, the job’s wel- 
fare.” 

McGinny understood. The 
work-and-wage ystem as a means 
of distributing wealth was on its 
last legs — there simply wasn’t 
enough work to go around, and 
the population continued to 
climb. As a last-ditch stopgap, the 
government had taken to making 
up idiot work so that there would 
be sufficient jobs available to keep 
the traditional economic system 
staggering on, but the farce was 
becoming more obvious every 
year. What more obvious example 
than this young Trippie, “guard- 
ing” men in sealed plasteel cells 
to earn his living. 

But at this particular moment 
McGinny was overwhelmingly 
grateful for the continued sham. 
It was accidentally providing him 
with the means of maintaining his 
sanity. 

“Listen, ” he said urgently, “lis- 
ten, kid, if you’ll come around 
and talk t me a lot. I’ll. .” He 
paused, baffled. He had nothing 
to offer. “I’ll be grateful,” he 
finished lamely, desperate with 

GALAXY 




fear that he would be rejected. 

“Sure, man,” the kid grinned. 
“I like to talk. ' Mostly I like to lis- 
ten. I’m interested in the criminal 
mind and all. I’ll bet you’ve got 
some interesting stories to tell.” 
“Yeah, you bet, kid. I got the 
most goddamned . interesting 
stories you ever heard in your 
life!” He paused again, embarras- 
sed by his fervor. 

“Hey, listen, man,” the kid said 
softly. “I know how it is. Nobody 
likes to be lonely.” 

And he smiled. 

The mome ahead completed its 
business and gunned away noisily, 
and Sol pulled his own vehicle 
smoothly up alongside the Chase 
World Bank. Rolling down the 
forward driver’s-side window, he 
addressed it. 

“Solomon Orechal, 

4763987IMHS967403888.453, 
license NY-45-83-299T.” 

The Bank, which bore a re- 
markable resemblance to a va- 
cuum cleaner making love to a 
garbage can, asked San Francisco 
a question, received a reply, and 
answered without a millisecond’s 
hesitation,’ “Sir?” 

“Request additions and altera- 
tions allotment, three thousand 
dollars and zero cents; travel al- 
lotment, five hundred dollars and 
zero cents.” 

“Purpose? ” 

“A and A: Fortrex cooling unit. 
Travel; to Lesser Yuma. ” 



“Justification?” 

“Profession: entertainer.” 

“Type and Credit Number, 
please, ” the Bank said a bit more 
respectfully. Its voice was like a 
contralto kazoo. 

“Folksinger. Number 

SWM-44557F, ASCAP. I’m my 
own agent.” 

This time the machine actually 
paused. Barbara squirmed on the 
seat next to Solomon, twisting her 
hair nervously. “Aren’t you going 
to get it, lover?” 

“Relax,” he said easily. “The 
Bank’s got to consult a human for 
this. Judgement decision re- 
quired. It’s bound to take a mi- 
nute or SO; they’ve got to decide if 
I’m worth shipping across the 
country.” 

“Oh, Sol. .” 

“Now don’t worry. Barb, I told 
you. If the Bank says no. I’ll use 
my own credit and we’ll go just 
the same. Now relax, will you?” 
The squat machine spoke up. 
“So ordered, ” it said emotion- 
lessly, “and good luck to you, sir. 
Have a pleasant time in Lesser 
Yuma. ” 

“You got it,” she said excitedly 
as Solomon engaged gears and 
roared away from the Bank, “oh, 
baby, you got it! When can we 

go?” 

“Get centered, mama,” he ans- 
wered as he slid the huge mobile 
home smoothly into the freeway 
traffic. “There’s a lot of things we 
have to do first. We’ve got to get

the cooling unit installed, gotta 
cop a big block of food, got to get 
the engine overhauled and tuned. 
Gotta say goodbye to our parents. 
It’ll be a couple of days, easy. 
Less if we bust ass.” 

Behind ■"his practical words Sol- 
omon was immensely pleased 
with himself Barbara had been 
difficult lately, carefully avoiding 
any mention of Truth Dope but 
finding more and more reasons to 
sulk. But he’d managed to find 
something to distract her. She’d 
never been out of New York State 
in her life, and travel held a fasci- 
nation for her, as for so many. A 
similar feeling had been responsi- 
ble for Solomon’s decision to buy 
a Mome in the first place, and so 
he was somewhat excited about 
the trip himself 

And too, his ego writhed with 
gratification that is performing 
record was in fact impressive 
enough to make the Bank invest 
in his relocation to an area where 
performers were scarce. Con- 
sciously he had never doubted the 
outcome, and he would never 
admit his subconscious doubts, 
but it felt good to know. 

You had to be good to be a per- 
former; it was one of the most 
sought-after jobs in the country. 
It wasn’t only the tremendous 
prestige, nor even the almost or- 
gasmic egoboo that applause 
brought. It was simply that the 
first time you saw drab, apathetic 
faces come alive during your set, 

122 



the first time’ you made some of 
those thousands of crowded, use- 
less people a little more content 
with their lot, somehow you 
never again felt that gut-ache of 
uselessness quite so sharply your- 
self 

“Sol,” Barbara said softly, 
breaking into hi reverie, “do we 
have to start. .right away?” Her 
soft fingers traced a question mark 
on his thigh. 

“Mama,” he mock-growled, “I’ll 
never be that busy!” 

And no one was more surprised 
than he when, having found a 
place to park the Mome, he failed 
to achieve an erection.

Xlow DID YOU ever come to 
be an embezzler, Mr. McGinny?” 
“I embezzled.” 

“No, I mean why?” 

“Because I wanted some 
money. ” 

The kid was impervious to sar- 
casm. “What did you want the 
money for? ” He adjusted the 
guard’s cap that looked so incon- 
gruous atop his shaggy mane, his 
hand stroking his mustache on the 
way down in a mannerism which 
McGinny suspected he could 
learn to hate sometime in the 
next ten years. “I mean, it isn’t 
like way back in the seventies 
when people were hungry. ” 

“Listen, what is, a quiz show or 
something? I mean, what’s it to 
you?” 

“Oh, I’m just curious, is all. I 

GALAXY 




mean, there’s nothing much else 
to do on this job but talk with you 
fellows. Anyway, crime interests 
me, you know? Like the things 
that made you end up. .in 
here.” 

“Well it’s none of your taken 
business, how do you like that?” 
McGinny snapped. The kid made 
as if to turn away, and suddenly 
McGinny almost panicked. The 
kid was a pain in the joints, but 
he was better than nothing, better 
than the tangled, tormenting 
company of McGinny’s own 
thoughts, of his self-recrimination 
and his frustrated rage. 

“No, wait, kid. Listen, I’m 
sorry, please wait. You. .you 
don’t want to lift off so soon. 
C’mon, look: a guy gets a little 
hot under the collar sometimes, 
you ask him personal questions. I 
didn’t mean any offense. ” 

The kid half-turned back to the 
door, stroking his mustache again. 

“Look, it was like this, see? I’m 
an accountant, I was I mean, and 
they pulled an audit at the wrong 
time. No big story — I just got 
caught with my hand in the 
cookie jar. Gould have happened 
to a dozen other accountants, just 
happened to be me, that’s all.” 

“Why’d you have your hand in 
the cookie jar?” 

“I needed the money.” There 
was a pause, and the kid turned 
to walk away again. 

McGinny cracked. “It was a 
fern, dammit. ” 

NOBODY LIKES TO BE LONELY 



The kid turned back again, 
smiling now. A gentle smile. 
“Yeah?” 

McGinny gave in. Maybe the 
kid was right — it might help to 
talk about it, straighten his 
thoughts. In any case it was cer- 
tainly better than trying to think 
of something new to play on the 
quadio. Or something to dictate 
into the voicewriter, which stub- 
bornly refused to do anything 
more than repeat his own 
thoughts back to him. 

“It was like this: I had to get 
my hands on a whole lot of money 
at once to shut this fern up. She 
had something on me that could 
have ruined me, had me by the 
hairs, and she loved every minute 
of it, the little slot. She had it in 
for me, but she needed green 
more than she needed my scalp, 
and she didn’t even care if I got 
burned gettin’ it. ‘You’re an ac- 
countant,’ sbe says. ‘You can get 
it.’ Sure. Easy. Ten years easy, 
and she walks away laughing. I 
had a chance. I’d be in here for 
murder right now.” 

The kid was all ears now, face 
almost pressed up against the cell 
window like a child at a candy- 
store window. “What’d she have 
on you?” he breathed. 

McGinny turned bright red. 
The kid didn’t bother to pretend 
to leave again; he simply waited. 
After a time the prisoner 
answered him. 

“See, she was. she was preg- 

123 




nant ^vithout a license, and she 
was far enough along she was 
going to start showing ariy day, 
and she said when they hauled 
her in she was going to name me 
in the afFadavit. The pregnancy 
fine alone tould have ruined me, 
let alone the Lifetime Child Sup- 
port without even a welfare op- 
tion. I mean, every man’s entitled 
to welfare, isn’t he? You can see 
what a jam I was in. I just had to 
have the green — she said if I gave 
her enough money to keep her 
and the kid until she could leave 
him with a sitter and go to work, 
she’d tell the Man she didn’t 
know who the father was.” 

“I don’t get it,” the kid said 
cheerfully. "What was the sweat? 
You’d have beat the heat easy.' 
Kark, they couldn’t pin an Elsie’s 
on you — it’s your word against 
hers. Unless there was a photo- 
graphic record of the 
conception. .” his voice trailed 
off with just the faintest sugges- 
tion of a leer. 

McGinny shrugged, made a 
face. “Well, maybe they couldn’t 
have pinned an L.C.S. on me, if 
it came to that. .” He seemed 
disinclined to continue. 

"Then I don’t understand why 
you took such a risk,” 
the kid persisted. 

“Well, ” McGinny said reluc- 
tantly, “I. .1 got a wife and 
kids.” 

“Oh,” the kid said brightly. ‘ 
“Have you got a picture of them?” 

124 



"No I have not got a harkin’ 
picture of them!” 

“All right, all right, don’t jump 
salty. I can take a hint. Sorry if I 
bothered you.” The kid gave hi.s 
mustache a final tug, turned and 
walked out of view down the cor- 
ridor. Suddenly terrified, not 
wanting to be alone with his 
memories, McGinny beat against 
the door with his fists. 

“Wait, damn you, wait] Hold 
on a taken minute, I didn’t mean 
to shout at you. Hey listen. I’m 
sorry, wait, come back, poease 
come back. Come back you bas- 
tard you, don’t leave me alone. 
You flonofabitch. I’ll cut your 
heart out, COME BACK]” 

Footsteps echoed faintly down 
the acoustically-muffled hallway. 

McGinny looked down at his 
hands stupidly. They ached terri- 
bly, and the heels of them glowed 
an angry red. He went to the 
mirror on shaky legs, tried a 
sickly grin, then whirled and 
threw himself across the bed, and 
very suddenly he was crying, the 
wild, racking sobs of a child. 

Sol looked around at the 
hundreds of prairie rats who made 
up a cross-section of the popula- 
tion of this particular sector of 
Lesser Juma, brushed the guitar 
strap out of the way of his wrist, 
and adjusted the microphone with 
a feeling of growing desperation. 
He wasn’t reaching them, he just 
couldn’t get it on for this 

GALAXY 




audience, and he felt a frustration 
which was growing familiar of 
late. 

It’s the people, he told himself 
frantically, tuning up to stall for 
time. There was plenty of parking 
space left in the deserts, and 
hence a trouble-free existence for 
Mome-owners who could afford 
cooling gear. But the thousands 
who had flocked to the vast bar- 
ren expanses had learned quickly 
that boredom was the price of ex- 
urban existence. They looked to 
entertainers like Solomon to keep 
them going, but the wary ennui 
they brought to a concert depress- 
ed him so much (he told himself 
now) that he just couldn’t seem to 
get into his music tonight. 

In desperation, he seized upon 
a song that summed up his mood 
precisely, one of his own. For the 
first time in his career he didn’t 
care how the audience liked it, 
whether it was what they wanted 
to hear. He hurt, and so he sang. 

This tune next year 

■ / will hate won or lost 

This time next year 

my lyridf^es all 
will be crossed 
I'll either he 
in headlines 
Or standin in 
the breadlines 
It all depends 

on how the dice are tossed 

This time next year 

/ will be up or down 

Far away from here 

or still hung up in town 
I'll either be in clover 



Or barely turnin’ over 
It all depends on how 
the deal goes down 
I feel it cornin’ on- 
it’s O so close now 
Wonder if it’s 
bad or good 
Hope it isn't gonna be 
an overdose now 
Really wish I knew 
where I stood 
This time next year. 

I’ll either win or lose 

This time I fear 

Tm on a short, short fuse 
I’ll either be together 
Enjoin' sunny weather 
Or suckin’ up 
an awful lot of booze 

He trailed off, fingers stinging 
from the harsh, emphatic runs. 
The catharsis of the bluew left 
him literally exhausted, but the 
pain was reduced to an empty, 
fading ache. 

The applause nearly frightened 
him out of his wits. 

From then on he had them, 
had them in the palm of his hand. 
Having made them cry, he could 
now make them laugh, or clap, or 
dance, or anything he had a mind 
to. He had shown them that he 
shared something with them, and 
now they could empathize, let 
themselves be taken with him 
along whatever musical road he 
chose to pick. 

It felt good. 

It was on the way home, joy- 
fully breaking the speed limit and 
humming snatches of his closing 
number, that he heard the news 
from Barbara. 



NOBODY LIKES TO BE LONELY

"Sol?” 

"Yeah, kitten? Here, have a 
toke. ” 

"Later.” She waved the joint 
away. "Sol, the clinic called while 
you were onstage. I came out to 
get my shawl and played back the 
message.” 

"Oh.” 

There was a pause. 

“Sol, they said. .the results 
were negative.” 

A longer pause, long enough for 
humiliation to turn to anger. 

“Well what the hell is that sup- 
posed to mean? Why, they’re full 
of shit. Negative! What is that 
supposed to signify, it’s all in my 
karkin’ mind? Is that it? ” 

She was silent, and his fury 
boiled over. 

‘ANSWER ME, GODDAM- 
MIT! Is it all in my mind?” 

“Sol, I don’t know, baby, I 
don’t know. Maybe they made a 
mistake.” She was crying, sound- 
less tears highlighted by oncom- 
ing headlights, and he flung the 
joint out the window in disgust. 

“Don’t make excuses for me, 
you taken slot! It’s no big deal. So 
the results were negative, so 
there’s a little something I got to 
work out in my head is all. You 
know I’ve got it. I just have to get 
it back.” 

He drove on furiously, concen- 
trating on the road until his eyes 
ached from squinting. They left 
the Mome colony behind, took a 
seemingly-abandoned side-road 

126 



up into the hills. The roai! 
swerved treacherously beside 
sheer precipices at some points, 
but Sol had his control back now, 
and his hands on the steering 
wheel were unnaturally steady. 
The ponderous Mome was like a 
live thing under his hands, and he 
drove it with a grim determina- 
tion. Eventually they passed 
through a great shadow-filled cre- 
vice between two walls of granite, 
and came out upon a ridge over- 
looking a great valley, invisible in 
the darkness. 

There were only seven or eight 
Momes parked here, clustered 
around the natural mountain 
spring which surfaced in this un- 
likely spot. It was sufficiently long 
that there was at least an acre for 
each of them. Solomon had been 
lucky to find this place, the few 
who had tended to keep their 
mouths shut. We are all very 
happy here, he thought savagely, 
wheeling the huge Mome to its 
parking space. 

He parked, shut down the en- 
gine, extruded the watersucker 
and threw power to the house 
generator. Pushing the button 
that dropped the seat-back flat, he 
got up and walked to the back of 
the Mome, flinging himself down 
on the bed without a word. 

Barbara got up and walked 
slowly back to the bed, sat down 
on the carpeted floor beside it. 

“Sol, what do we do now?” 

“What the kark can I do?” he

said, voice muffled by the pillow. 

“Well, as far as I can see, 
there’s only two things left. 
Analysis, or. ” 

“Or the Truth Dope,” he 
snarled, lifting his head to throw 
her a venomous glance. “Get my 
head candled or my chromosomes 
scrambled, that’s the choice, 
huh?” 

‘“Well, all I know is I’m pretty 
karkin’ sick and tired of mastur- 
bating, ” she shot back, and then 
gasped. 

He winced. 

“I’m sorry, baby,” she said piti- 
fully. “You know I didn’t mean 
that. ” 

“Well, it’s true, and there’s no- 
thing I can do about it, ” he 
barked. “I’ll be go to hell before 
I’ll let some professional voyeur 
probe into my sex-life. Analysis! 
No thanks, mama. If there’s 
anything wrong with me, I’ll fix it 
myself. I’m not about to have 
some fumble-fingered idiot “ad- 
justing’ my personlity for me.” 
“Then do some truth, lover,” 
she pleaded. “Just once, do Truth 
with me. Once we know what it 
is, we’ve got it licked. It’ll never 
bother us again.” 

He tried to stall for time. “Ah, 
we’d never find a connection for 
Truth out here in the sticks. 
Forget it, mama. It’ll pass. ” 

She bit her lip. “Sol. .I’ve got 
some here. I brought it with us 
from New York.” 

He stared at her, mouth dry, 

NOBODY LIKES TO BE LONELY 



and knew that it was all over. 

“Sol, please baby, take it with 
tne. Honey, I don’t want to live 
with a man who’s. .who’s impo- 
tent.” 

It was the first time either of 
them had said the word, but he 
didn’t explode as she had half ex- 
pected him to. He only buried his 
head in the pillow for a long, long 
time, tasting defeat, accepting 
•what was to come. At last he 
raised himself up on his elbows 
and regarded her levelly. 

“Okay, Barbara,” he said 
quietly. “We’ll do Truth.” 

Shakin! 

Taken! 

All forsaken! 

I think 1 got to 
flash now, mama. 

Believe I got to flash! 

Mcginny slumped in his chair, 
growling along with the fiizzbass. 
The quadio’s separation was im- 
properly adjusted, forcing him to 
hold his head at an uncomfortable 
angle. By now this had produced 
a permanent crick in his neck, 
which had a serious eflFect on his 
peace of mind, not to mention his 
taste. The snarling flash tune he 
had opted for was symptomatic of 
a growing unease (as, in startl- 
ingly close analogy, it was with 
flash freaks outside the prison). 
The ex-accountant was seething 
with frustrated rage, and would 
not understand why. 



127 




The moog took a solo on the 
left front speaker, began pouring 
on the watts. With a treble 
shriek, the speaker went dead. 

McGinny howled with rage, 
sprang from the chair and stood 
under the sf)eaker, cursing ful- 
minously. 

He leaped upward and smashed 
his fist at the darkened area be- 
hind which the dead speaker 
crouched, accomplishing nothing 
whatever. “Ten years,” he gib- 
bered, “Ten years!’' He began 
slamming his fists against the near 
wall, flaying the limits of his uni- 
verse with a black hatred. His eye 
was caught by the skull face of the 
time-lock, grinning reminder of 
the unpaid balance of his sen- 
tence, and he struck at it sav- 
agely, fracturing two knuckles on 
its hard surface. 

His bellow of pain chopped olf 
in the middle as he saw his jailer 
watching him from a foot away. 
The kid’s face held a clinical in- 
terest; his cornflower-blue eyes 
gazed with infuriating calmness 
into McGinny’s. 

“Oft,” the prisoner snarled over 
his shoulder at the paraplegic 
quadio, which went completely 
silent at once. “What the hell are 
you staring at?” he demanded of 
the young guard. 

“Why’d you hurt your hand?” 
the kid asked. 

McGinny checked an angry 
retort. This kid was just too dumb 
to know any better, he decided. 

128 



“Ah, the karkin’ quadio blew a 
speaker,” he grumbled. 

“Looks okay from here,” the 
kid said. 

“Well, it doesn’t sound okay 
from here,” McGinny snapped. 
“Left front channel’s gone.” 

“Gee, that’s a beat,” the kid 
acknowledged. “They wouldn’t 
crack the lock for something. .” 
“I know they wouldn’t crack the 
lock for something like that,” 
McGinny barked. “What the hell 
you rub it in for?” His hand 
began to throb, the numbness 
wearing olf now. 

“I didn’t mean to rub it in, Mr. 
McGinny. I just thought you 
mighta thought. .” 

“Well-I-didn’t-so-just-shut-up- 
about-it-all-right?” the prisoner 
said through grated teeth. Kark, 
this kid was dumb! 

“Sure. Hey listen, wow, I 
meant to ask you. You never told 
me about how come you let that 
fern talk you into taking the 
green.” The jailer tugged at his 
mustache and regarded McGinny 
expectantly. 

McGinny turned, took a few 
steps from the window. Then he 
frowned and turned back resig- 
nedly. “It’s like I told you: she 
was going to stick it to me.” 

“Yeah, but she couldn’t prove a 
thing. Or could she?” 

“She didn’t have to prove it. I 
told you I got a wife and kids, 
didn’t I? What do you think my 
wife’d do. I’m down in Paternity 

GALAXY 




Court? What do you think my 
boss’d do? Bigshot Z.P.G. support- 
er, he’d toss me on the street in 
a minute. It ain’t like if I sold il- 
legal dope or run over somebody 
stoned. You can’t get fired for 
criminal record any more. But an 
unlicensed pregnancy? A third 
kid? Don’t make me laugh. She 
didn’t have to prove a thing to 
Bnish me off.” 

“Yeah, I guess I see. .” said 
the kid. “But one thing I don’t 
understand. .” 

“You don’t understand nothing. 
You never been married. I’d have 
done anything to keep Alice from 
leaving me. Anything.” His voice 
broke. “I. .1 loved her.” 

“That’s what I don’t under- 
stand,” the kid said eagerly. “I 
mean, if you loved her so much, 
how come you topped this other 
fern? I mean, sure, everybody 
likes variety once in a while, but 
you must have a House in your 
neighborhood, you must have had 
the money.” 

“Hey listen, I never paid for it 
in my life, ” McGinny said 
proudly. “I mean, half the thrill of 
love is in the conquest. ” He had 
read that somewhere. 

“So then, since your wife was 
already ‘conquered’ she didn’t 
turn you on?” 

“Of course she turned me on. I 
told you I loved her, didn’t I? But 
there was this fern I met at the 
Automat, worked in the same 
building, and she looked like she 

NOBODY UKES TO BE LONELY 



never had it, you know? So I 
called her up that night, invited 
her out for a drive.” 

“Top her that night?” the kid 
exclaimed. 

“Well, sure,” McGinny said 
modestly. “You know, I kind of 
always had good luck with 
bargains.” 

“Plural? You mean there were 
others?” 

“Not too karkin’ many others. I 
told you I loved my wife,” 
McGinny said suspiciously. 

“But you said. ” 

“I know what I karkin’ said,” 
McGinny barked. 

“Okay, take it easy. I was just 
asking. “Cause I thought you 
meant. .” 

“Well, keep your thoughts to 
yourself Jesus, you ask a lot of 
dopey questions. What’s the mat- 
ter, you got nothing better. .” 
His voice trailed off as he caught 
himself. “I mean, what makes you 
so taken curious?” 

“Oh, I just wonder a lot. You 
know, how come you’re in there 
and I’m out here and all — I’ve al- 
ways been kind of philosophical, 
you know? Into people, like I 
said. I mean, we all start out the 
same, and some of us do things 
others don’t. I guess I’m just 
curious about what makes people 
tick. How come she got preg- 
nant?” 

“Huh?” 

“I mean, don’t you use any- 
thing?” 

129 




“Well, sure, but I mean, I 
didn’t know. Hell, first date and 
all, I. .1 just figured she’d be 
using something. Nice piece like 
that. .’’ 

“But you said she looked like a 
virgin.” 

“Well, that’s it, see? How was I 
supposed to know she’d spread 
right off like that?” 

“But you just said you always 
had good luck with. .” 

““Get oflF my case, will you? I’m 
telling you, this fern was a slot. 
She. .she told me it was all 
right, see, because she wanted to 
get me by the pills, pump me for 
green, get it? ” 

“‘Look, I don’t know, you were 
there and I wasn’t, but frankly 
that sounds like a load of used 
food to me,” the kid said evenly. 
“You told me all she asked for was 
support until she could work 
again, didn’t you? And just for 
that she was willing to take the 
rap and lose her own Welfare. 
Doe.sn’t sound like a slot to me.” 
“Get out of here, you fuzz-faced 
stuffer! Who the hell asked for 
your opinion, anyway? Go on, get 
taken before I. .” 

“Before you what, bro?” the kid 
asked softly. “You can’t get out of 
there, can you? You can’t even 
snuff yourself to embarass me. 
I’m not a captive audience, but 
you’re sure a captive performer. I 
don’t understand what you did, 
and you’re going to explain it to 
me. Sooner or later.”

“I’ll see you in hell first,” 
McGinny shouted, almost gibber- 
ing from helpless rage. 

“Sooner or later,” he repeated, 
tugging at his mustache. 

McGinny’s eyes widened, and 
hfe placed a hand on either side of 
the window. “You’re enjoying 
this, aren’t you? You little nark, 
you’re really enjoying this!” 

“Does that matter?” the kid 
asked softly. “Does it really make 
any difference whether I enjoy it 
or not? All I’m doing is asking you 
questions. The answers you al- 
ready know yourself, right? Or 
you couldn’t answer the ques- 
tions. I’m not putting any words 
in your mouth — just asking ques- 
tions so I can understand why you 
did what you did. All I want, ” he 
said simply, “is the truth.” 

“You want it, you clinical little 
bastard, but maybe / don’t,” 
McGinny snarled. 

“Oh, well. .” said the kid, 
shrugging. “There I can’t help 
you, Mr. McGinny. I mean, even 
if I don’t ask you another thing, 
you’ve got ten years to go, and 
there’s noplace to hide in there. 
How long you think you can duck 
the truth?” 

“Forever, you lousy bastard,” 
McGinny roared. “Get out of my 
life, go on, get the hell out of 
here.” He turned away in dismis- 
sal, began pacing the room an- 
grily. / don’t have to take this 
kind of sewage! I’ll write to the

to he stopped suddenly, 

struck by the obvious. Prisoners 
lost all their civil rights 
— including access to the postal 
computer network. His voicewriter 
lacked the familiar “Transmit” 
key. There was no way for him to 
get a letter to anyone, unless the 
kid agreed to take it down for him 
and deliver it. 

Somebody else has got to come 
by, sooner or later, he thought 
frantically. A maintenance man, 
somebody! 

No one had so far. 

He was trapped, pure and sim- 
ple, trapped with this shaggy 
punk kid with his words that 
twisted the truth into lies and 
made you feel like you’d done 
something wrong, like you de- 
served all this instead of merely 
being caught up in a web of cir- 
cumstances that could have hap- 
pened to anybody. The little 
staffer’ll he back, to pick at me 
and twist everything all up. En- 
joys it, like he was pulling the 
wings off flies, like. 

He spun around angrily, and 
the kid was still there, his face 
frarned in the window over the 
skull-like time-lock. 

“Spying on me, you. .” 
McGinny groped for words. 

“No,” the kid murmured. 
“Just. .just observing you.” 

McGinny howled. 

The drug which Solomon 
Orechal’s age knew as Truth 



Dope had been known to man for 
hundreds of years before a single 
word was ever written about it. 
Known, that is, to some men. 

The first words written about 
Truth Dope appeared in the mid- 
dle Twentieth Century. Author 
William Burroughs passed on a 
legend of unknown origin con- 
cerning a forgotten tribe in the 
trackless wilds of South America 
who used a drug he called “yage,” 
which induced temporary mental 
telepathy between its users. The 
brief mention was too preposter- 
ous to be taken very seriously, of 
course, but there were many in 
those times who took preposter- 
ous things seriously. Rumors 
traveled the junkie grapevine, 
apocrypha rode the dealers’ trail, 
and the A-heads spoke in whis- 
pers of yage. 

In vain. Yage existed, and its 
ridiculous Lost Tribe as well. But 
they were not exactly lost. 

They were hidden. 

For the telepathy that its users 
experienced under the influence 
of yage was more than the ability 
to send and receive messages 
without material aid. It was rather 
a total dissolution of all the walls 
surrounding human conscious- 
ness, a complete opening of 
minds one to the other, providing 
the first and only escape from the 
solitary confinement of the human 
skull. It was a melding of per- 
sonalities, a stripping away of all 
cover. 



NOBODY LIKES TO BE LONELY 



131 




Two pc(q)le who took yage sim- 
ply had no secrets from one 
another. At all. 

Secret thoughts, inner motiva- 
tions, hopes, shames, dreams, 
pretenses, likes and dislikes and 
the true inner feelings of that part 
of the heart whose name is un- 
pronounceable, all were laid bare 
to a partner in the yage experi- 
ence. 

That the drug should have re- 
mained so perfect a secret for so 
many hundreds of years was not 
in the least surprising. Realizing 
what they possessed, and its po- 
tential for good and evil, its 
discoverers — the Kundalu — 

adopted a policy of isolationism 
utterly simple in execution; any- 
one they did not recognize was 
apprehended, and yage stuffed 
down his throat. 

Then they either killed him or 
married him. 

This delightftilly uncomplicated 
system lasted until 1984. Inevita- 
bly, the Kundalu were discov- 
ered, by a real estate, developer 
looking for a place to put 2,650 
condominiums. Over twelve 
hundred years of self-knowledge 
on a level unknown to mankind at 
large had made the Kundalu wise 
and canny indeed — 175 of the 
condominiums had been built and 
fifty-three sold before the clearing 
crews stumbled across the Kun- 
dalu village. 

The strange and humble indians 
would not leave the land where 



holy yage grew, nor permit its 
razing. 

They resisted the developer’s 
half-hearted attempt to learn their 
vestigial spoken language, lest the 
secret of its growth be somehow 
wrested from them. He, in turn, 
was impatient — and out there in 
the bush, no sanctions could be 
applied to him — he was, after all, 
building dwelling units. He 
slaughtered the simple Kundalu 
to the last man. 

It chanced that four of the crew 
assigned to demolish the primi- 
tively beautiful village of the 
Kundalu were welfare clients 
— counterculture types who recog- 
nized the ceremonial bowls of 
dried leaves they found for what 
they were: a communal drug. The 
foreman found them inside a 
structure like a decapitated dome, 
open to the skies but closed to 
the gaze of passers-by, and he 
understood enough of the joyous 
babbling he overhead to shoot all 
four of them dead. 

In six months he and the de- 
veloper had a small but estab- 
lished corporate identity in the 
underworld of big-time drug traf- 
fic. In a year, the developer had 
him killed. Within four years, the 
developer was outselling the 
quasilegal giant. Speed Inc. and 
was giving even the mammoth, 
completely legal International 
Marijuana Harvesters a pain in 
the balance sheet, despite the fact 
that Truth (as yage was brand- 



132 



GALAXY 




named) was still on the Illegal 
List. 

The usual controversy flared in 
the news media, freighted with a 
larger than usual bulk of ignor- 
ance, for very little indeed was 
known about Truth Dope. In time 
the substance might completely 
overturn many time-honored con- 
cepts of personal privacy, many 
institutions of law and justice, 
many truisms of human 
psychology — but at present abso- 
lutely all that was known about it 
was that it was curiously resistant 
to chemical analysis, and that no 
more than three people could 
safely share the drug. The stres- 
sed of mingling identities with a 
larger number were severely unh- 
inging; the ego tended to get lost, 
and the secret of finding it again 
had died with the Kundalu. Be- 
fore that had been proven to the 
counterculture’s cynical satisfac- 
tion, many communes ended in 
gibbering insanity. 

Nor did many triads flourish. 
By its nature Truth became a 
couples’ drug. Thus: 

Solomon and Barbara sat naked 
in the rear of the Mome, facing 
each other in lotus. The windows 
were opagued, the roof trans- 
parent; the mobile home was 
open to the skies but closed to 
the gaze of passer-by. 

“Should we smoke?” 

Sol considered this at length, 
shrugged. “I don’t see why not. 
The parts to be opened go deeper 
than pot can reach. Maybe it’ll 

NOBODY LIKES TO BE LONELY 



relax us. This is going to be a lit- 
tle scary.” 

Barbara caught his nervousness, 
mulled it over carefully. 
“Sol. .you’re really jumpy about 
this, aren’t you?” A flash of in- 
sight: “You’ve done Truth before, 
haven’t you?” 

“Why ask? You’ll know for 
yourself in a little while.” 

“Sol. .Sol, maybe you’re right. 
We don’t have to rush into this. I 
don’t. .” 

“You don’t want to know?” Sol 
burst out. “After all the pleading 
and convincing you’re scared of 
the Truth? Oh, no! Have a few 
tokes and then we’ll get to it. I’m 
not going to call this off now, and 
then wait to see how long it is be- 
fore you want to know again, be- 
fore you start hinting and then 
urging and then demanding. No 
way, mama. We re doing Truth 
today.” 

Barbara lowered her eyes, and 
busied herself searching for the 
Grassmasters. She found a crum- 
pled pack on the right-hand ser- 
vice shelf qver the bed and passed 
them to him. Current social eti- 
quette required the woman to 
wave the joint alight, but Sol- 
omon had chosen to smoke GMs 
specifically because they did not 
have ignotips, and had to be lit by 
hand. He enjoyed the archaic 
ritual of striking fire with his 
hands and placing it where it was 
needed, and spent a not insig- 
nificant portion of his income on 
thfe hard-to-find matches. Now 

133 




more than ever, she sensed, he 
would want that feeling of control. 

He accepted the marijuana im- 
passively, producing a box of 
wooden matches from the pocket 
of the tunic which lay beside him 
on the bed. By his other side lay 
the ancient, hand-made Gibson 
J-45 which was his comfort and 
sometimes his voice, and Solomon 
struck a match along the silk- 
and-steel A string with a quick 
snap of his wrist. Echoes ot 
whispering giants overflowed the 
sounding-box, and Solomon 
sucked flame through the filtertip 
joint with a sharp urgency. 

He passed the joint to Barbara, 
cupping it protectively in his 
hand. Reaching to take it, she was 
struck for the first time by how 
much in him was conservative, if 
not reactionary. His independent 
thinking had struck her until now 
only as an evidence of the creativ- 
ity she admired and loved in him; 
all at once she realized how much 
of him yearned for an earlier age. 
He cupped the joint as if wary of 
detection — yet pot had been 
legalized long before his instincts 
were trained. He played an acous- 
tic guitar in an electronic age- 
— certainly it sounded mellower 
than contemporayr instruments, 
but mostly it was older. In a 
dozen innocent mannerisms she 
detected for the first time an un- 
dercurrent of yearning for the un- 
complicated past, when men still 
controlled their destiny. If I keep 
pulling insights like this, she 

134 



thought, gulping smoke, I wont 
need Truth. 

And it was true. Expecting im- 
minent truth, her mind was rev- 
ving up, extending the sensitivity 
threshold of its own built-in truth 
detectors, trying to approach 
both drug and experience as hon- 
estly and openly as possible. 

She passed the joint back to 
Solomon, who took it impassively, 
emptying his lungs for a second 
hit. He would not meet her eyes. 

She watched his bare chest fill 
as he drew on the smouldering 
cigarette, and became unaccount- 
ably aware of the weight of her 
own breasts. She looked down at 
them, and it was only when she 
observed that her nipples were 
swollen that she remembered that 
before the night was out, 
Solomon’s impotence should be 
over at last. In a vivid flash of 
memory she saw again the look of 
his eyes when orgasm took him, 
and she shivered. 

“Barb.” 

She looked up. He was holding 
out the joint, breath held tightly. 
Brushing hair from her eyes with 
9 vague hand, she took the joint, 
which was burned down close to 
the filter. 

She inhaled sharply. 

Very suddenly, the air began to 
sparkle, and a gentle buzzing fil- 
led her head. “Whoops, I’m 
stoned,” she said and giggled, tak- 
ing another puff. 

“Say, you must have been 
smoking some of that there 

GALAXY 




merry-wanna,” Solomon said 
gravely. 

“Well of course, ye damn fool,” 
she crowed, spraying smoke. 
“How else would I get stoned?” 
They roared with laughter. 

Sol retrieved the joint from her 
relaxing fingers and stubbed it out 
in an ashtray. Still giggling, he 
slid open a sliding panel in the 
wall, removed an Oriental 
figurine; a carven dragon with 
sparkling eyes. He touched it 
under one wing, and its mouth 
opened wide. Prisoned in its 
lower fangs was a blue capsule. 

Solomon tilted the dragon. It 
spat the capsule onto his up- 
turned palm. 

Barbara stopped giggling. “Oh,” 
she said. “Yes.” 

Solomon met her eyes. “Yes.” 

He made a long arm, pulled 
open the refrigerator, and re- 
moved a plastic flask, red with 
white logo. “Better take this with 
soda,” he said judiciously. “Taken 
stuff tastes wor.se’n peyote.” 

He could have read that in a 
magazine, she thought. 

He put the flask of Coke on the 
bed between them, shifting his 
weight carefully to avoid spilling 
it. He dried his sweaty left hand 
on his thighs and broke the cap- 
sule open onto his palm. It made 
a powdery pile of grey veined 
with green, fine-grained and dry. 
He held out his hand. 

Barbara reached, gingerly 
bisected the pile with her thumb-

nail, sweeping the two portions 
far apart. Looking up at him one 
last time, she bent close, licked 
one of the two doses from his 
hand, and grabbed for the Coke. 
She made a face. “Oooooh!” 

He nodded gently as she 
gulped Coke, then took the flask 
from her. Eyes on the remaining 
powder, he licked and gulped 
Coke in almost the same motion. 
When he had swallowed, he put 
down the flask, wiped his hands 
on the bedspread and took her 
hands in his. 

“Okay, mama,” he said with 
great tenderness, suddenly vul- 
nerable. “Here we go.” 

W'IcGINNE CAME howling OUt of 
sleep, flailing wildly with leaden 
arms. 

“Goddam skull-face kid,” he 
shouted, and then fell back ex- 
hausted, drenched in sour sweat. 
Coherence came slowly to his 
thoughts, and he was torn by an 
unbearable craving for a cigarette. 
He tried to masturbate, and could 
not. 

He rolled finally from the bed, 
padded to the bookviewer and 
selected a book at random, falling 
heavily into the chair. He stared 
at the displayed title page for a 
few moments, reached out to 
punch for the next page and slap- 
ped the set off instead. He buried 
his face in his hands and wept. 

Nerves stretched wire-tight, he 



shook with racking sobs. He dug 
his knuckesl into his eyes, but 
could not banish the haunting, 
palpable vision of Annie beside 
him on her bed, naked and vul- 
nerable, cringing under his wrath 
(his baby planted now in her 
belly). He ground the heels of his 
hands against his ears, but could 
not banish the sound of her tears 
as she begged him for emotional 
support (“You said you were 
going to divorce her. Mack, I 
need you with me on this — it’s 
our baby.”). He beat at his skull 
with his clenched fists, but he 
could not deny the memory of his 
decision to “borrow” enough 
money from his company to leave 
town, going underground and 
leaving the whole impossible 
tangle of his life behind. 

And above all, he could not 
shut out the voice of the blonde 
kid with the incongruous hat, 
could not seal the holes that soft 
voice blasted through McGinny’s 
carefully-wrought fortress of 
rationalization. When the mind 
refuses to face truth, it very often 
knows what it is doing; a high 
truth-level is only tolerable to 
saints and those sinners who, lov- 
ing themselves, have learned how 
to forgive themselves. But 
McGinny no longer had any 
choice. 

For the kid never attacked in 
any overt way, never quite gave 
him a justification for his helpless 
rage. He just. .asked questions. 



136

and McGinny could not keep the 
answers from leaping unbidden to 
his mind. 

Nor could he forget them now. 
The jailer’s soft voice, hideously 
amplified, seemed to fill the cell, 
as it had for days now. 

“Well I don’t know, Mr 
McGinny. You say that security 
and prestige were your goals, but 
doesn’t it seem like you already 
had them both? And yet you 
weren’t satisfied. .’’ 

“So then you’re saying sex is 
kind of like a power trip for you, 
aren’t you?” 

“Well, why didn’t your father 
divorce her then? I would have. ” 
“Then Annie’s probably having 
a pretty rough time of it now?” 

“I get it. You were afraid to 
leave Alice. .No?” 

“But Isn’t that just a fancy way 
ol saying. .?” 

.’’but you just said. ” 

But didn’t you just. ?” 

“But I thought. .” 

“But. .” 

McGinny burst from the chair 
with an animal howl and swept 
the desk clean of paper with 
clawed hands, swinging his arms 
wide and scattering sheets in all 
directions. “I’ll kill you, ” he 
shrieked, and tore at his hair. 

He lurched around the cell, 
kicking and punching at the un- 
yielding fixtures, slamming his 
shoulder into the wall with whim- 
pered oaths. He beat on the sur- 
face of the quadio, snapping off 



both controls, and the machine 
roared into life. Shorted some- 
where within, it picked its own 
tape, at peak volume. The selec- 
tion was old, stereophonic, ac- 
tivating the rear speakers only — it 
balanced perfectly. The ear- 
splitting voice of Leon Russell 
plaintively asked: 

Are we really happy 
with this lonely 
^ame we play? 

Searching for 
words to say 

Searching but not finding 
understanding anyway 

We re lost 
in this masquerade. 

McGinny staggered, his hands 
over his ears. He could not shut 
out the song. He lay down on his 
back and smashed at the quadio 
with his bare heels, and it went 
dead with one last shriek. 

As he lay panting on the floor, 
his ears still ringing, he opened 
his eyes to see the kid watching 
him from the door window. 

McGinny began to sweat pro- 
fusely. He struggled to his feet 
and looked wildly around the 
room. Rubber silverware, paper 
sheets, no razor, GO AWAY, KID! 

“Say, did I near noise just now? 
Kinda late to play the quadio, 
isn’t it, Mr. McGinny? Oh, I bet 
I know. You got to missing Alice 
and the kids, didn’t you, Mr. 
McGinny? 

“Hey, Mr. McGinny! What are 
you. .hey\

“Oh holy shit. 

“Oh wow.” 

The kid’s face pressed closer. 

The drug came on very slowly 
at first. 

For what seemed like hours, 
Barbara felt only a gradual numb- 
ing of her extremities, a slow 
falling-off of communication with 
the nerves and muscles of her 
limbs. She and Solomon gazed 
deep into each other’s eyes, 
motionless in lotus. She yearned to 
let her gaze travel downward over 
his body, but she maintained eye 
contact tenaciously, as though 
afraid of opening a circuit that was 
being built between them. 

Very suddenly she was blind. 
Almost immediately, all tactile 
sensation vanished from her body. 
Adrift in crackling black, she 
could no longer see or touch any- 
thing in any direction. Although 
she had learned enough from 
friends and media reports to be 
expecting this, it still took her by 
surprise. She yelped. 

As from a great distance, she 
heard Solomon’s voice reassuring 
her, needlessly explaining that 
they were only experiencing a 
repression of distractions, that it 
was only a drug which would 
wear off, the standard litany of 
calming things that are said to one 
who might be freaking out. The 
truly extraordinary thing was that 
the voice changed as it spoke 
from stereo the monaural, con- 



verging inside her skull, as though 
she had switched from speakers to 
headphones. 

“It’s okay, Sol, I’m all right,” 
she assured him, and then 
realized that she had not spoken 
aloud. She tried to and could not. 

They drifted for awhile in si- 
lence, then. And as they drifted, 
sparkling darkness everywhere, 
each became aware of a growing 
presence, for which no words or 
symbols existed, which their 
minds could not grasp but only 
see/feel/taste. Barbara concen- 
trated as hard as she could on the 
complex abstract which was Sol- 
omon Orechal’s identity in her 
mind; received no familiar echo. 

Of course, she thought, of 
course he sees himself differently 
than I do. She waited patiently 
for her mind to construct a sui- 
table analogy for the identity-waves 
she was beginning to receive, and 
wondered what he was seeing. 
Soon I’ll know. 

The darkness coalesced, light- 
ened perceptibly. An image began 
to take form, seen simultaneously 
from all angles. 

It was a smooth iridium sphere. 

It gleamed before her in the 
swirling dark, self-contained and 
apparently impenetrable. Her 
heart began to beat faster, a bass 
drum miles below her. 

As she watched, spellbound, 
she saw the polished surface of 
the sphere begin to discolor, to 
tarnish. Portions of its surface 



138 



GALAXY 




began to bubble and flake away, 
as though the metallic sphere 
were immersed in a clear acid 
that was slowly oxidizing it away. 
A high, sharp whining became 
audible, a sound of reluctant dis- 
integration. 

The image disturbed and fright- 
ened Barbara. She sensed an un- 
controllable power latent in the 
sphere, ready to burst it asunder 
when it was sufficiently weak- 
ened. Girlfriends had tried to 
tell her of their experiences 
with Truth, but' the closest Bar- 
bara had heard to this was a 
woman who said she initially per- 
ceived her partner as a man in 
full medieval armor, visor down. 
Unsettled, Barbara found that she 
was employing a pressure she 
could not define, in a manner she 
could not describe, against the 
sphere she could not understand. 

Whatever it is, she screamed 
silently, let it end now. It’s been 
too long already. 

Time stood still, and she 
slipped into a new plane of under- 
standing, intuition refined into 
knowledge. She perceived all at 
once that the walls of the sphere 
drew strength in some way from 
the marijuana Solomon had 
smoked — and that he had known 
they would. 

He lied, came the thought. 

And at that, the sphere crum- 
bled like a sugar easter egg in a 
glass of boiling water. 

Parts of that explosion of data 



she forgot as soon as she per- 
ceived them. Parts of it she could 
carry with her to the end of her 
days. Some things simply could 
not be forced into words, some 
translated as paragraphs, some as 
single words or impressions coded 
only to subvocalized grunts or 
wordless cries. Alone in the dark- 
ness that crackled and roared she 
recoiled, struggling to reduce the 
enormous input to something 
comprehensible, pursued by 
howling fragmentary echoes of 
forgotten thoughts and memories.

Shaken to her roots, she reeled 
but held on, too terrified to let 
go. There was something beneath, 
something hidden, something that 
made alarms go off all over her 
subconscious. And as well as 
something hidden, there was 
something missing, and she knew

intuitively that they were con- 
nected. What’s missing? she 
screamed toward the place where 
she had once supposed Cod to 
be. What is wrong? The

Inside! With a sinking feeling of 
terror and despair Barbara yanked 
her attention from the chaotic dis- 
tracting turmoil that the sphere 
had held, and turned it inward. 
She found only the confusion of 
her own thoughts. 

She was alone inside her skull. 

Where was Solomon? Why was 
he not probing her consciousness, 
as deep within her identity as she 
was in his? 

Frantic now, she reached back 
out to the welter of tangled 
thoughts and forgotten memories 
emanating from her lover, 

140 



and swept at it, in a manner 

impossible to describe. The roar 
of swarming images died as 
though she had struck a suppres- 
sor switch, and she saw several 
things very clearly. 

She saw that Solomon had 
palmed most of his share of the 
drug. 

She saw his consciousness, 
trembling, crouched, incoherent 
with terror. 

She saw at last that which he 
had sought most to hide: that the 
feeling he professed to have for 
her was non-existent, a cover for 
his real motivations. 

She saw his triie reason for 
clinging to her; a paralyzing fear 
of being, in history’s most 
crowded era, intolerably alone. 

She saw that her man had 
never confronted her identity as 
an individual, never allowed him- 
self to perceive her as a person, 
as anything but a palliative for 
hideous loneliness. Nor anyone 
else in his life. 

She saw that he was afraid to 
confront her identity, to accept 
the guilt he knew he bore for 
using another human being as a 
tool, a teddy-bear, a living fetish 
with which to ward off demons of 
solitude. 

She saw the indifference with 
which he regarded her own hopes 
and needs and fears, saw the re- 
lentless guilt which made him de- 
spise himself for it. 

She saw the desperation in 

GALAXY 




which he had sought to hide the 
truth from them both by reducing 
his dosage of yage and distorting 
both their synaptic responses with 
pot. 

Conprehension and compassion 
washed over her as a single wave, 
a wave of pity and love for this 
tormented man to whom she had 
given her heart, and she cried out 
in her mind: it's all right, Sol, it’s 
ALL RIGHT! Don’t be afraid, 
please. I love you. 

Undrugged, her heard her not. 

She saw swimming to the sur- 
face of his mind a surreal cartoon 
figure of herself, choked with re- 
vulsion, recoiling from the self- 
ishness of his love, face contorted 
with bitter rejection. No! she 
screamed silently, but she knew 
he could not hear, knew she 
could not make him hear, and 
knew with astonished horror that 
he was snapping, could no longer 
bear the crushing pain of the guilt 
he could not forget; and she 
realized with a nauseating cer- 
tainty what he was going to do. 

The throbbing undercurrent of 
fragmented voices swelled to a 
shuddering roar in her skull, and 
now each of those voices was only 
a throaty growl. 

She screamed once, and then 
many times. 

The hissing of the torch re- 
verberated in the bare corridor 
with an acoustic sibilance that was 
unpleasant if you listened to it. 

NOBODY LIKES TO BE LONELY 



Jerry and Vito had learned not to 
listen to it. 

"Ain’t had this thing out of the 
shop in so long, I feel like 1 
oughta take it for a walk,” Jerry 
said, adjusting the oxy mix. 

“Yeah,” grunted Vito from be- 
hind his opaque mask. 

“Naw, we sure don’t have to do 
this very often.” 

Vito grunted again. 

“Wonder what made him do it. 
You know? Whole place like that 
to hisself, nobody to tell him 
when to go to work, when to go 
to sleep. Just lie around all day 
and think about ferns, that’s what 
I’d do.” 

‘So get busted, ” Vito grum- 
bled. 

“Hey, bro. What’s with you? 
You got a belly-ache or some- 
thing?” 

“Gimme the willies, that bird.” 

“Him? He ain’t givin’ nobody 
nothin’.” 

Vito grunted a third time, and 
Jerry shook his head, returning to 
his cutting. Welfare check’s due 
tonight, he thought suddenly, and 
smiled behind the polarized mask 
that shielded his eyes from the 
arc of the tortl. 

Noises came from the distance, 
approaching. Hastily, Vito stub- 
bed out a Gold and tucked the 
roach in his shirt pocket. 

The warden came into view 
around the corner, followed by 
two long-haired guards. He swept 
past Vito and Jerry without a 



141 




word, ignoring the torch, and 
peered into the window of the 
cell door. 

“Mmmmmmm,” he said. “Yes.” 

The two guards shifted their 
weight restlessly. 

“All right, said the balding 
official. “All right. Obviously it’s a 
suicide.” 

“Obviously,” murmured one of 
the guards, a blonde, mustached 
youth. The warden glared at him 
irritably. 

“Why wasn’t I notified at 
once?” 

“You were, sir,” the guard said 
evenly. “Union regs say you only 
have to check ’em twice on night 
shift unless otherwise ordered. 
That’s how I found him an hour 
ago. It was already too late to 
help him.” 

“Oh, very well, very well,” the 
warden grumbled. “Carry on, you 
two.” He went away, trailing the 
two guards. The blonde one was 
smiling faintly. 

Jerry and Vito looked at each 
other, shrugged. Jerry realigned 
the still-snarling torch against the 
door, and Vito relit his joint. 

“Sure is a good thing this old 
torch leaks so bad, or he’d have 
smelled that and taken your ass,” 
Jerry grinned. Vito passed him 
the joint; he slid it behind his 
mask and toked quickly, before 
the smoke could accumulate and 
lace his eyes. After a time he left 
off tracing a nearly-complete, 
foot-and-a-half circle in the plas- 



teel door, and paused. Giggling, 
he began to inscribe eyes and a 
broadly smiling mouth within the 
circle. Vito watched and smoked 
silently. 

Again echoes sounded distantly. 
“Jesus,” said Jerry. Vito glared at 
him and swallowed the joint. Has- 
tily, Jerry completed the circle 
and began hammering at the disc 
he had cut, frantic to unseat it 
before his artwork was seen. 

He was barely in time; even as 
the plug fell into the cell with a 
crash, two fat men came into view 
at the end of the corridor. One 
wore black and one wore grey. 
Both wore the same expression. 

Jerry and Vito scrambled to 
their feet and backed away from 
the door, striving to look straight. 
The fat men came near simul- 
taneously, entirely ignoring the 
two welfare workers. 

The one in grey reached gin- 
gerly through the new hole in the 
cell door, pulled toward himself 
with a gloved hand. They both 
entered, walked a few paces in- 
side, stopp>ed. 

“Not much either of us can do 
here, is there. Doctor?” 

“It seems not. Father.” 

“Well, then ” 

“Yes.” 

They emerged, began to walk 
away. 

“Hey,” Jerry yelped. 

The physician turned. “Yes?” 

“Wh. .what do we do 
with. .?”

GALAXY 




The fat grey man paused, 
thought for a moment. “Unlock 
the infirmary and put him in 
there somewhere. I’ll have a 
vehicle sent.” He and the priest 
left, talking about chess. 

Jerry looked at Vito, who gave 
him a very black look. He knelt 
and extinguished the torch, and 
silence fell in the corridor. 

They went inside. 

“Jeez,” Vito breathed softly. It 
sounded like a prayer. 

The two-inch-thick plug was 
lying just inside the doorway, its 
imbecile smile upside down. 
Beyond it lay McGinny, on his 
back, a feral and bloody grin on 
his face. His wrists had been 
chewed open. 

“Jeez,” Vito sai4 again, and 
began putting on his gloves. 

Solomon orechal sat in his 
chair and surveyed the room 
which was to be his home for the 
next twenty-to-life-depending. 
With a disgusted sigh he picked 
his J-45 from the bed, hit a G, 
tuned, hit an E, tuned, hit an E 
again. Satisfied, he modulated 
through D back into G, added a 
seventh. 

“This time next year” he sang, 
and stopped. 

After a while he sang “Pack Up 
Your Sorrows,” and that was all 
right, but when he had finished 
he found himself wondering who 
he could give all his sorrows to, 

NOBODY UKES TO BE LONELY 



so he went right into Lightning’s 
“Prison Blues,” and managed to 
get off on that. 

But before long, inevitably, he 
was playing the song he used to 
close every set, the one he hadn’t 
wanted to play here, now. He 
was halfway into James Taylor’s 
“Don’t Let Me Be Lonely To- 
night,” when he saw the face at 
the cell window, blonde mustache 
under a blue uniform hat. He 
leaped from the chair, tossing his 
pride-and-joy heedlessly toward 
the bed, and sprang to the win- 
dow. 

“HEY OUT THERE, can you 
hear me?” he shouted. 

“Hey man, be measured,” came 
a soft voice, electronically muf- 
fled. “I can hear you heavy.” 

“Wow, listen,” Solomon bab- 
bled, “you work here, man? Or 
what? Hey listen, you want to 
hear a song? You got a minute? ” 

“Sure, bro, sure. Take it easy.” 

Solomon ran back to the bed, 
picked up his axe and threw the 
strap over his head. He began 
frantically patting his pockets for a 
flat-pick, discovered he held one 
in his hand. 

“What are you in for?” the 
blonde guard asked quietly. 

“Huh? Me? Oh, uh 

rape,” Solomon said, gripping the 
pick. “. .and murder,” he 
added, and looked down, hitting a 
very intricate chord. 

'The blonde jailer’s eyes lit up, 
and he tugged at his mustache, -k

Among the characteristics by which 
life can be recognized are ingestion, 
excretion, irritability, tenacity. 





It was a young thee, as trees 
go, planted from seed in the days 
preceding urban sprawl. Its cul- 
tivator, an elderly man with an 
inordinate and uncommercial 
fondness for berries, owned a 
hundred acres of foliage adorned 
with black and purple and red 
morsels of sweetness. He lived in 
a rambling manse of a style too 
southern for the local climate; 
thus he succumbed to pneumonia 
before the seedling bore its first 
fruit. For a time, rabbits and 
squirrels feasted on his bequest; 
the tree, mature at last, showered 
its bounty in the weeds for their 
sole benefit. But, inevitably, 
civilization arrived. A contractor 
annexed the land for his latest 
subdivision, and the vines and 
brambles were mashed under 
tractor treads, drowned in fresh 
topsoil, buried beneath concrete. 
The trees, toco — the old oaks, the 
hickories, the elm — were all cut 
down for standing in the wrong 
places ... all but the berry tree, 
which the bulldozers had some- 
how missed. The contractor de- 
cided to leave it there, at the 
edge of one of the newly-formed, 
ungreen yards — he thought it 
gave the property character. He 
resolved to -charge an extra five 
hundred dollars for it. 

Harry and Marlene bought that 
house, and they laid out a flags- 
tone patio in the shade of the 
tree. It was March, and the 
branches were still bare. 



1 HE SHIP TUMBLED about him, 
its gravitors demolished. Nutrient 
fluid from the suspension-tank 
foamed over the controls, but he 
didn’t worry about that — they 
were too disrupted to suffer 
further harm. He fought tenaci- 
ously to maintain the tender 
host-body’s life-functions, to pre- 
serve the faint spark that flickered 
through its neural web. Yet all his 
hyperorganic power was insuffi- 
cient; his host’s senses dimmed, 
its pulse diminished, it man- 
ipulators ceased to respond. Addi- 
tional emergency procedures were 
futile; he contracted into the ul- 
timate shelter of the central body 
cavity. 

Despair descended, a despair 
he had never known before. He 
might survive the crash, but un- 
less he obtained a new host im- 
mediately, his dessication in raw 
atmosphere would follow with re- 
lentless speed. 

The prospect of such a fate dis- 
turbed him little, though it was a 
particularly grisly sort of end, but 
the shocking reality of his per- 
sonal failure brought him to the 
brink of catatonic dysfunction. He 
was shamed, and his own un- 
specialized tissues revolted against 
his shame, secreting painful acid 
enzymes throughout his amorph- 
ous, slightly alkaline body. He 
had misjudged the strength of the 
deadly sphere of radiation en- 
veloping this siren world of blue 
seas and white clouds. 



145 




It was only just that he should 
pay for his failure with his life- 
— he resigned himself to that- 
— but his duty lay in warning his 
comrades of that danger, arid the 
abstract imperative of duty de- 
manded ^that he survjve long 
enough to accomplish it. 

A violent concussion shuddered 
through the cabin as the craft 
slammed into the densest layer of 
atmo.sphere. Deceleration hurled 
his ruined life-support system 
against the view-screen. Helpless 
and on the edge of utter with- 
drawal, he dreamed, lapsing into 
shock as the crash plastered his 
protoplasm against the bulkheads. 
He dreamed still — though he was 
scarcely one agonized molecule 
thick — while the ship collapsed 
about him; dreamed of a lazy fu- 
ture after the struggle for race 
survival had ended in victory. 

When his feeble, unaided 
senses returned, he found himself 
entombed in glowing metal. His 
ship was smashed and fused 
beyond recognition, his host pul- 
verized and charred, but his own 
resilient fibers, or thirty percent 
of them — enough — survived. He 
dragged himself away from the 
heat, out into the alien air. He 
sensed a large life-form nearby, 
and some hidden reserve of 
strength propelled him toward it. 
It made no attempt to escape but 
accepted him docilely; he entered 
easily through a scratch in its 
outer covering. Methodically, he 



extended filaments of his sub- 
stance throughout its vascular sys- 
tem, feeding reflexively as he 
went. 

He slept. 

^^I’m so glad we bought this 
house, Harry. The mulberry tree 
really makes a difference.” 

Harry shrugged. His wife had 
mouthed that same line so many 
times before that he had de- 
veloped a conditioned reflex. The 
tree was her idea. He was more 
interested in the sod that he had 
purchased at vast expense and 
which was slowly but steadily 
turning brown under his ministra- 
tions. 

“Look — tiny berries I thought 
they were caterpillars, they’re so 
white and bumpy looking. Frieda 
says they’re very tasty when 
they’re ripe. ” 

Harry eyed the tree noncom- 
mittally. Berries did not excite 
him. 

“I guess we shouldn’t spray it if 
we’re going to eat them, but look 
at the poor leaves. They’re all 
chewed up. Aren’t there bugs you 
can buy that will eat the bugs that 
eat the leaves?” 

“I don’t know.” Harry had lived 
in a fifth floor walk-up as a child 
and in a three hundred unit 
high-rise as a young adult. Not 
only the tree, but the whole sub- 
urban bit was his wife’s idea. ^ 

“I think I’ll ask the man at the 
nursery.”

GALAXY 




“Ask him about the grass, too.” 

Catatonia failed to claim 
him, but he was semi-torpid for a 
long time, regenerating and re- 
gaining his old strength. Eventu- 
ally, intellection superseded in- 
stinct; he surveyed his savior with 
critical intensity. From its size 
and sturdiness, he judged it to be 
a mature individual, a member of 
a slow-growing, long-lived 
species — a durable haven in 
which to contemplate his future. 
But the lack of sensory apparatus 
was disconcerting. Vision, in par- 
ticular, would have been of use; 
he had become accustomed to vis- 
ion in his former host and felt 
disoriented without it. Manipula- 
tion, too, was absent, and locomo- 
tion, but he was not immediately 
concerned; many creatures went 
through stages of free-living in- 
terspersed with immobility. It was 
possible that other senses would 
appear later in the life-cycle. He 
was prepared to wait. 

He strained upward, experienc- 
ing heliotropism and photosyn- 
thesis. 

YOU SWEEP those god- 
dam berries off the patio, Mar- 
lene?” • 

“More will fall as soon as I’m 
done.” 

“I can’t stand it; they squish 
and stain my shoes, they’re all 
over the lawn chairs, and I’m 
tracking them into the house.” 



“Stand on the grass.” 

“They’re in the goddam grass, 
too! Every time I mow the lawn, 
I get sprayed with berry juice.” 
“Well, Marlene replied, if 
you’d pick them all, there 
wouldn’t be any left to fall.” 

“I don’t have time to pick ber- 
ries. I come home tired and want 
to relax, not clirrib around in 
some tree, getting full of berry 
juice. Why don’t you pick them?” 
“You’re the one it bothers.” 
“Yeah, but you’re home all 
day. ” 

“I’ve got enough to do to take 
up all my free time. Besides, we 
need a longer ladder to get the 
ones near the top. If you ate the 
berries, I might be persuaded to 
pick them.” 

“You eat them.” 

“Tve had enough.” 

“Then give them away.” 
“I don’t feel like playing mig- 
rant worker just to feed the 
neighbors, thank you.” 

“Well, Tm going inside! ” He 
stormed away from the patio, and 
his foot slipped on an over-ripe 
berry or two that lay in the grass, 
causing him to perform back- 
wrenching contortions in order to 
avoid falling. The doctor diag- 
nosed a slipped disc and pre- 
scribed a month in traction. 

He knew heat and cold and 
the loss of minor tissues. As water 
crystallized around his host’s up- 
permost appendages and piled in 



TREE OF LIFE 



147 




drifts around its central support, 
it lapsed into dormancy. He with- 
drew to its lowest extremities, 
where life lingered, digging deep 
into solid matter in search of nu- 
trients. 

He began 'to fear that the indi- 
vidual he occupied was one which 
died in the coldest season. If so, 
he was as doomed as when his 
ship crashed. He could not leave 
a host while it was alive, yet if 
none of those small mobile crea- 
tures which abounded in warmer 
times was near enough for trans- 
fer when this host perished, he 
was lost. 

He worried unnecessarily. As 
temperatures rose, he flowed up- 
ward with his host’s sap and swam 
in chlorophyll. 

1 HE SAME GODDAM THING 
every year, ” said Harry. “The 
goddam tree must pollinate it- 
self ” 

“The man at the nursery said it 
was wind-pollinated.” 

“If people did that, we’d be 
knee-deep in babies by now!” 
“Calm down, Harry.” 

“If I could. I’d pick every god- 
dam flower olF that goddam tree. 
Then there wouldn’t be any god- 
dam berries. ” 

“They’re catkins, not flowers.” 
“Shut up, Marlene. I’m gonna 
chop it down.” 

He wasn’t too familiar with axes 
but the doctor said it wasn’t a 
dangerous gash. 



He felt his host in pain. It 
was a slow kind of pain, slowly 
perceived and slowly reacted to, 
but pain nonetheless. He flowed 
toward the injury, sent tiny ten- 
drils of himself to investigate it. 
To^ his previous host, it would 
have been fatal; the circulatory 
system was almost severed, the 
central support dangerously 
weakened. But the new host was 
hardy, and when its slow sufiering 
had faded, it blossomed as before. 

He was not entirely pleased by 
this. He had come to realize that 
his host was long-lived but per- 
manently stationary. It had saved 
his life, but it was otherwise use- 
less; he required’ locomotion, at 
least, for the consummation of his 
plans. He had to transfer from 
host to host until he lodged in a 
member of the dominant species 
of the planet, which he knew 
from his studies was technologi- 
cally advanced enough for his 
purposes. But until his present 
host died, he could not transfer, 
not even tQ one of the small 
mobile creatures that scrambled 
about him more and more often 
as the weather warmed. So he 
waited. Cycle after cycle passed, 
and his host survived — and lack- 
ing organs of manipulation or 
locomotion it could not even be 
forced to kill itself 

Sooner or later, his people 
would come to this planet, and 
the faulty information he had sent

them would mean their destruc- 
tion. 



T DOWN FROM THERE ! Mar- 
lene, why do you let these kids 
climb in that tree? It’s too 
dangerous. ” 

“Oh, Harry, leave them alone. 
They aren’t climbing very high.’’ 

“Get out of that tree! God- 
damit, you’re full of berry juice. 
Get into the house.” 

“Harry, be careful with that 
thing. You know how unmechani- 
cal you are.” 

“Don’t worry about it. I know 
what I’m doing this time.” 
Methodically and with great satis- 
faction, he began to cut off the 
smaller branches. The power saw 
vibrated pleasantly in his fingers. 

“How much are you going to 
prune?” asked Marlene. 

“All of it, twig by twig.” 

H E FELT HIS HOST being dis- 
membered, and he withdrew to 
the lower extremities, where the 
major portion of his flesh had al- 
ways rested. Not quickly enough, 
though — a filament of himself was 
caught and sliced off. He shrank, 
pooling deep within the host, and 
nursed the raw edge. Vibration 
shook him, and he knew from his 
host’s reaction that the damage 
was intensifying. If only he knew 
what appendages were being re- 
moved, he could concentrate his 
whole body in one of them and be 



removed with that limb, which 
would then undoubtedly die and 
free him. 

The agent of destruction, he 
knew with his own unaided 
senses, was alive, and the random 
way in which it chose to work first 
on one side of his host and then 
another betrayed its mobility. He 
felt confident that it possessed vis- 
ion, too, for its use of the metal 
cutting tool was precise and swift. 
The randomness, however, 
stymied him. Where to go and 
how far? 

He waited, holding his body as 
compact as possible, hoping he 
would be removed in one piece; 
he would have given another slice 
of himself for vision. 

“After it’s seasoned, we can 
burn it in the fireplace,” Harry 
said triumphantly. “Wood is damn 
expensive these days.” 

“What about the trunk?” 

“Forget it. I’m tired. Paint it 
blue and use it as a chair. ” 

His host lived slowly and died 
slowly. Deep among its lowest ex- 
tremities, cells divided and 
reached for moisture, but above, 
it was inert. He waited, impatient 
now, for he often sensed the 
warmth of other life touching his 
host. 

Cells divided and fed, and he 
remained.

of trees were cut down, and their 
trunks never sprouted.” 

“They died of Dutch elm dis- 
ease, Harry. The city cut them 
down so they wouldn’t fall on 
anybody. ” 

“Can we give this thing Dutch 
elm disease?” 

“I don’t think a mulberry tree 
can catch it.” 

“We’ve got to get rid of it.” 

“Harry, you promised you’d 
panel the rumpus room this 
summer.” 

The tenacity of his host over- 
whelmed him. If only it were 
mobile he would have no com- 
plaints. Here was another danger 
to warn his people against; he 
only wished someone had warned 
him\ 

KNEW IF I let it go this year 
the damn thing would have ber- 
ries. How do they grow so fast? 
And now it’s a bush instead of a 
tree, and the roots are cracking 
the patio. Why didn’t you nag me 
to finish the job, Marlene? ” 

“H ow about weed-killer, 
Harry?” 

“I don’t want to kill the grass. 
I’ll dig it up.” 

“Harry, the man at the nursery 
said those roots grow deep.” 

“So, I’ll dig you a swimming 
pool while I’m at it! Leave me 
alone. This is between me and 
this goddam mulberry tree.” 



He felt something worrying 
at his host’s lowest extremities. 
They were being exposed to air. 
A mobile creature was clearing 
the solid matter away; he could 
feel the pressure of its soft flesh 
against his host’s substance. He 
contracted upward, away from the 
source of disturbance, realizing 
with satisfaction that his host was 
being detached from the life- 
giving nourishment below. 

He had already chosen his next 
host: the creature that killed his 
present one. 

Perhaps it was not too late. 



You can’t burn that in the 
fireplace, Harry. It’s too big. ” 

“I’ll saw it up. ” 

“But it’s full of dirt.” 

“I’ll wash it with the hose. 

“Oh, Harry, it’ll never dry; it’ll 
just rot.” 

“Goddamit, then I’ll haul it to 
the dump!” 



i^MONG THE rustless 
aluminum cans, the soggy, used

garbage his host rested. Once a 
month a tractor came along and 
shoved some soil on top of the 
mound. Rich, nutrient-laden soil. 
The slowly-dying tree thrust out 
rootlets, thrust up green shoots, 
and was dying no more. In time, 
it bore fruit. It was a young tree, 
as trees go, with the tenacity 
common to all vegetation, and it 
had a long, long life ahead of it. *

A MAI.ZBERG festival for those of 
you who, like me, are Malzberg 
addicts: Guernica Night (New York, 
Bobbs-Merril, 146 pp., $6.95), a 
novel, and Out from Ganymede 
(New York, Warner Paperback Lib- 
rary, 160 pp., $1.25), a collection of 
short stories. 

Barry N. Malzberg is a true 
phenomenon; prolific, icono- 
clastic, bitter, angry, hilarious, and 
utterly self-directed. Guernica 
Night, a short novel together with a 
most perspicacious Appreciation by 
Jeff Clark and some introductory 
remarks by his friend and sometime 
editor Roger El wood, is a most un- 
settling book. The basic theme is 
suicide: what am I doing here, and 
really, who should 1? . cast in a 



near ftiture in which instiuitaneous 
transportation is available to all me, 
and in which governmental policy is 
to prohibit, or at least inhibit, the 
population from taking the Final 
Trip. How much of Malzherg’s nar- 
rative is metaphor and how much is 
narrative is in the eye of the behol- 
der. In some sequences he is in vio- 
lent confrontation with people who 
are not there at all; in other, despite 
the dreamlike quality of the prose, 
the other guy is indeed there and 
when struck, bleeds. It’s the kind of 
book which keeps gnawing away at 
you after you put it down. It isn’t an 
easy book to read, to review, or to 
think about afterword. I can’t pre- 
dict where you will wind up when 
you read it, but — try it.

Ijoing from Malzberg to A Place 
Beyond Man, by Cary Neeper (New 
York, Scribner’s, 400 pp., $7.95) is 
like going from sauna to snowbank. 
The beautiful microbiologist Tandra 
Grey, together with her adopted 
two-year-old daughter, are whisked 
away to a base on the other side of 
the Moon which is occupied by two 
species, the ellls (yes, friend 
printer; three I’s), who are happy 
quasi-amphibians, totally involved 
with their senses; and varoks, au- 
stere, taciturn, and cerebral. In the 
course of the narrative, Tandra be- 
comes an interface between these 
two, to the ultimate benefit of all. 
Interesting comparisons are made 
between the history and cultures of 
the three species, and Tandra’s 
convoluted approach to acceptance 
of love from the ellls and the gift of 
her own to the varoks is interest- 
ingly documented. And yet through 
it all the passion, the sex, the an- 
guish, the anger, and all the other 
points on the emotional spectra 
through which Tandra passes, there 
is a cool and clinical detachment 
which the author seems not to be 
aware of, not to be able to eradicate. 
Human passions are not orderly, 
and this book is, every line. And 
everything is explained. Every- 
thing. If there is a single common 
denominator to really good charac- 
terization by really good writers, it 
lies in their discovery that with 
human and believably humanoid 
beings, you can’t explain every- 
thing. If you try, you are shoving 
tiles around on a game board. 

Harry martinson is a Nobel 
Laureate. This pleases me, because 



in my own secret world I long ago 
nominated him for this together 
with half my kingdom and the hand 
of my fairest daughter — not because 
of his most famous work, Aniara, 
which is science fiction of the high- 
est order, nor because it sold forty 
thousand copies in hardback in spite 
of being a poem, nor because it was 
made into a fine opera, but because 
of one passage he wrote:S/ie wounds 

She wounds you 
as a rose 
will wound. 

Not always, 
as expected, 
with its thorn, 

A rose 

will always wound you 
with its rose. 

One of the headiest adventures 
in reading I have had in a long while 
is Worlds in Creation (Henry Re- 
gnery, illustrated, with 8 pp of 
photographs, index, and bibliog- 
raphy, 232 pp., $7.95) Kenneth W. 
Gatland is a Briti.sh scientist. Presi- 
dent of the British Interplanetary 
Society, a Fellow of the Royal As- 
tronomical Society, and the editor 
of Spaceflight magazine. His two 
years of solid effort on the book col- 
lided with other commitments and 
he was assisted in its completion by 
Derek Dempster, former test pilot 
and science writer. The Foreword is 
by astronomer Patrick Moore. The 
book was published in England with 
the title The Frontiers of 
Knowledge , which I think is much 
more apt, because the book con- 
cerns itself with the farthest reaches 
of that growing edge at which sci- 



153 




ence begins to involve itself with 
mysticism and religion and 
philosophy — with which, at base, 
science has never had any serious 
quarrel. Much of the book will 
seem, to this audience, a review of 
things long known — the origin of 
the universe, the solar system, the 
planets; the nature of evolution, and 
so on. Regard it as just that- 
— review — the back-pacing one 
does before the forward sprint to a 
great leap. Gatland’s plunge into 
the areas of mysticism and religion 
is bold indeed, and the basic state- 
ment of the book is that our ancestor 
is the Universe itself, and the fu- 
ture, into which we have barely 
poked our noses, is the vast bulk of 
our history. So shrill (and of course, 
so justified) are the cries of doom 
these days that a book which holds 
so high a hope for us comes as al- 
most a shock, and what comes with 
it, a resurgence of that sense of 
wonder which got us all into this 
mountain of marvels, .science fic- 
tion, in the first place. 

D NOW, now, I can get into 
what I have been wanting to do for 
weeks, what I have been getting 
other things out of the way for, what 
I have, at the same time, ignored 
duties and rituals, my wife, my 
child, my rabbits and my dog. And 
now I hardly know where to begin. 

How about this: I have just read 
the very best ever to come out of the 
science fiction field. 

How about that. 

Or I could start like this: 
Dhalgren, by Samuel R. Delany 
(New York, Bantam, 896pp., $1.95) 
is the all-time Best Buy. 



There are so many things to be 
said about this astonishing 
achievement that it would take 
many more than 896 pages to cover 
them all, and 1 make the flat predic- 
tion that criticism and commentary 
on Dhalgren will exceed that page- 
count very many times over. 
Further (and I think one must read 
the book before thoroughly ap- 
preciating this point) the urge to 
comment evokes an instant fury of 
fi-ustration because of the necessity 
of putting down words in a linear 
fashion while the pressure is to say it 
all at once on every one of the many 
levels in which the hook itself com- 
municates. Seat the greatest per- 
former in the world on the bench of 
the world’s most elaborate organ, 
facing the orchestral score of the 
most celebrated symphony ever 
composed, and then amputate nine 
of his fingers, and he will tell you 
about this kind of frustration. No- 
thing one can lucidly state about 
this book can emerge like anything 
but one-finger music. Delany calls 
for response in chords because he 
writes in chords. 

Looking back over the immense 
experience of having read 
Dhalgren, one recalls certain crests 
and peaks: a strophe on rape, great 
crystalline stretches of poetry and 
about poetry, sex sequences so ex- 
quisitely delineated that dirt cannot 
adhere to their polish, and above 
all, the injection of atmosphere — all 
kinds of atmosphere, meteorolgical, 
ecological, aural, emotional, 
spiritual. And character! The Scorp- 
ions, ragged and deadly kid gangs 
armed with holographic projectors 
which surround them with huge, 




154 



GALAXY 




brilliant, terrifying shapes; Mr. 
Newboy, whose profound literary 
criticism would not be amiss in Wil- 
liam Carlos Williams or T.S. Elliot; 
frightened blonde June, the obses- 
sive rappee, fifteen-year-old 
Denny, a depraved innocent who 
knew, perhaps, some things about 
love which could benefit us all, and 
Lanya, whom I love, whom I shall 
always love. There are dozens 
more, and perhaps the most 
memorable character of all is the 
city itself, Bellona. It is somewhere 
in the U.S. , and has experienced an 
unnamed disaster; but it is more 
than that. Metaphorically it is 
“here” — any man’s “here” — and 
unless you are very different from 
the rest of us, you will allow that 
from time to time “here” shifts and 
changes in remarkable ways while 
“here ” shifts and changes in re- 
markable ways while “why” re- 
mains a mystery. In addition, the 
protagonist is never sure of his own 
name; that is to say, he spends a lot 
of this gigantic novel in not knowing 
who he is. 

Do you know who you are? 

Have you noticed how often re- 
cently, in sf shorts and novels, this 
theme of transient or alternate real- 
ity occurs, and how it increases? For 
some rather fascinating reason 
which I must seek out some day, 
this looks like the trickle which will 
be a torrent in most literature in the 
near future. Who am I? What am I? 
Where am I, and what, really, is 
“here”? The natural pressure of 
growth and change, decay and re- 
birht, has always been in direct con- 
flict with our hunger for stasis, sol- 
idity, permanence, security. It is in 



these areas in which Delany and 
other truly great, finished writers 
live and work; it is in these areas 
where live the wonders and as- 
tonishments, the surprises, the new 
learnings, the discoveries of things 
and processes hitherto unknown or 
(a very different thing) unrecog- 
nized. 

The ultimate, test of great and last- 
ing literature is its usefulness. I 
have said it and said it; the big ones, 
from Homer through Shakespeare 
to Nabkov and Delaney, are fables, 
metaphors, parallels to your 
thou^t and actions and passions 
and mine. The usefulness of 
Dahlgren to you and to me is 
beyond question. Having experi- 
enced it, you will stand taller, un- 
derstand more, and press your hori- 
zons back a little further away than 
you ever knew they could go. 

I have space to say only one more 
thing about Dahlgren . It is a paper- 
back original, and as such is going to 
be by-passed by serious critics 
everywhere. Some of us have been 
fighting this especially pernicious 
snobbery for a long time, with a cer- 
tain but regrettably small amount of 
success. Rumor has it that a whole 
series of hardback houses turned 
this one down, until paperback re- 
lease was the only course. I’ll try to 
get the facts on this and will share 
them with you if I can, but in the 
meantime proclaim with me our 
gratitude to Bantam Books. The ul- 
timate recogntion of Dhalgren as 
the literary landmark it truly is, as 
expressed in strong sales and wide 
acceptance, will do more to elimi- 
nate this snobbery than any amount 
of fulmination from this chair. ★

Dear Mr Baen: 

I am confused! In past issues of Galaxy 
and If, there has been talk of the new sf 
I’ve been reading both magazines for the 
past year. The writing field — part time 
— appeals to me. I find that both 
magazines keep me in touch with the pre- 
sent sf scene. 

Anyway, the reason I’m confused is that 
I’m not sure what the new sf is. Are the 
recent stories in both magazines the new 
sf? I would appreciate your expert defini- 
tion. 

Your faithful mag. reader, 
Bruce Rea 

5025 Saratoga 
Eugene, Oregon 97405 

Beats me. 

Dear Mr. Baen; 

It’s now two issues almost! in a row 
you’ve had something I ought to thank you 
for, and I couldn’t hold myself back. But 
first; 

One: I’m tremendously pleased with 
your editorship. Until you took over, my 
husband and I had pretty much dropped 
If & Galaxy from our reading. Now (this 
year) we’ve come back. 

Two: My sympathies about If s suspen- 
sion. I hope everything eases up quickly 
so we can enjoy it again. 

Now to the meat of the letter. 

I’m awfully glad Mr. Sturgeon inserted 
the comments on rare blood. I never knew 
mine was anything out of the ordinary, 

156 



and even though it’s the commonest rare, 
the information was definitely worth hav- 
ing. I gave the Red Cross some of my 
blood about 2 weeks later, and have sent 
in my form to the Rare Blood Club. It’s so 
nice to know my blood is really of some 
use to someone besides myself! 

And now, the most recent issue has Ur- 
sula LeCuin’s remarks about SF. I write 
SF, though I’m not yet good enough to 
buy, and my aim is to produce good SF. 
My husband, however, is the “arrogant ” 
sort who believes that SF is the junk you 
read when you come home tired from 
work. He’s pounded the image of SF as 
trash into my head so often I wonder occa- 
sionally if I’m seeing more in it than there 
actually is. Thank heaven for Ms. 
LeGuin’s article. She’s just about the only 
author he will grant does write good litera- 
ture in the field (he even buys ber books 
IN HARDBACK), and even though I don’t 
think his basic opinion has changed, it’s 
given him something to consider. And it’s 
relieved the pressure for mediocrity from 
me, whether I finally do write first-class 
stories or not. 

I was also shocked to find myself read- 
ing the science article on black holes. 
Even though I’m the sort of person whose 
eyes glaze at numbers of any sort (includ- 
ing phone and license!) and who treats 
formulas like man-eating plants, I just flew 
through Dr. Pournelle’s clear presenta- 
tion. 

Lastly, thanks for putting Alter in 
Galaxy. I would have missed him.

And thank you! 

Dear James Baen, 

I have just finished reading Le Guin’s 
article in the Dec. issue of Galaxy. Of all 
the interesting articles you have printed in 
the Forum, this is the most provocative 
and stimulating one.' I cannot agree with 
Le Guin more. Her points are well made 

GALAXY 




and touch on something that I have 
thought of writing to you about several 
times. The point she stressed was the 
chance, at last, to get intelligent criticism, 
from people trained to do it. Damon 
Knight is the only peson inside the field to 
do a good job of intelligent criticism. Since 
he quit there has been a vacuum which 
has not been filled, either inside or out- 
side the field, until recently. 

I think you now have a chance to take a 
very bold step with Galaxy. If you look at 
all science fiction magazines you will find 
reviewers, no critics. The magazines are, 
for all intents and purposes, closed doors 
to the Academe, with the possible excep- 
tion of this article by Le Cuin. There’s 
been a hell of a lot of talk about the sud- 
den profusion of high school and college 
courses in S.F. and the methods of teach- 
ing such courses, but beyond that there is 
silence. Why not approach, say, Darko 
Suvin to do a bimonthly or even quarterly 
critique for Galaxy? It would put Galaxy 
out in front by a mile as a magazine seri- 
ously interested in the future of the genre 
and its expansion. 

It would also serve to broaden readers' 
perspectives and appreciation of science 
fiction. The interchange can only be bene- 
ficial to all of us, writers and readers alike. 

As Le Guin points out there are alot of 
walls up, which for an open, supposedly 
unlimited field is hypocritical. 

I know Galaxy is already a little 
cramped, but it can’t hurt and it can serve 
to open doors and least knock on walls. 
Shevek did it, why not Galaxy? 

All the best, 
Nicholas Grimshawe

Dear Mr. Baen: 

It is with great regret that I read of the 
“demise” of IF in the Dec. ’74 issue. Since 
taking out my subscription in January 1972 
If has provided many hours of reading 
pleasure in its particular vein. The control- 



led "hard-science” approach of Galaxy re- 
lative to If has much to offer but variety is 
the spice of life. I would like to offer a few 
comments on the elements of If which I 
feel should be carried over and given 
prominent billing in the Galaxy-If fusion. 

One of the first things that comes to 
mind is the cover art of Rick Stembach. 
His "Starbow” cover for the April 1974 
issue was breathtaking and one of the most 
beautiful covers I’ve seen in several years. 
A painting like that is worth making into a 
poster cum Frank Frazetta. This cover 
along with the Dec. 1974 cover have con- 
vinced me that Stembach has the potential 
to rank with Freas and Gaughan with con- 
tinued experience. Other readers will rec- 
ognize his talent only if exposure of his 
work is continued. I certainly hope that he 
will be contracted by the new magazine 
for his art work , which has provided much 
visual pleasure so far. 

I am glad that Geis’ “The Alien View- 
point” will be continued. Although much 
of what he says seems like nonsense at 
times, it’s refreshing to hear him expound. 
One column I did fervently agree with was 
the Dec. one, where among other things 
he cited Gene Wolfe as an example of the 
rising wave of “academic SF,” Since I am 
a double major in college in Chemistry 
and Literature I straddle the fence of two 
different worlds of college viewpoint. After 
reading Wolfe’s “The Fifth Head of Cer- 
berus, ” ‘The Island of Dr. Death and 
Other Stories,” and “The Death of Dr. Is- 
land ” I am amazed at the popular support 
these stories have received in Hugo ballot- 
ing and I was especially appalled at 
Wolfe’s Nebula for “The Death of Dr. Is- 
land.” After slogging through stories like 
these what is one left with? From the 
“hard-science ” point of view nothing is 
gained in interpretation and from a sym- 
bolic literary angle, the ideas that Wolfe is 
attempting to express are so obscure as to 
become unimportant. 

While I’m not advocating the extreme 
“Get SF out of the college and back into 
the gutter where it belongs ” vein of 



157 




thought, some allowance has to be made 
for the reader. I felt cheated of my time 
after reading the Wolfe stories. A strong 
writing talent has written himself into a 
corner inacces.sible to most except those 
willing to stop and pick apart levels of 
meaning. The writer shouldn’t force his 
reader to do work worthy of a doctoral 
thesis to get the crux of meaning. Such 
stories will not he mulled over by an audi- 
ence waiting to hear what writers such as 
Wolfe have to say. 

Getting back to items that should be in- 
cluded in the new magazine, I hope you 
will continue publishing the work of Colin 
Kapp. His recent serials for If, Patterns of 
Chaos and The Wizard of Anharitte had 
me suspended for weeks waiting between 
installments. Few SF writers of this de- 
cade have matched Kapp's vividness. 
While stories about exotic forms of planet- 
ary exploration such as Anderson’s ‘‘Call 
Me Joe ” and Clement’s Mission of Gravity 
have been seen before, Kapp’s “Mephisto 
and the Ion Explorer” gave an approach 
which showed originality and work on the 
author’s part. His is a talent that 1 hope 
won’t be neglected by you in the future. 

Well, that’s about it. Best of luck to you 
with your combination magazine. I’ll be 
avidly following its progress and hoping for 
the best. 

Sincerely yours, 
William B. Catus III

Dear Sir, 

Like William ]. Denholm III in your 
September issue, I have been very much 
impressed with the recent rise in quality 
in Galaxy and If under your editorship. As 
a member of Mensa I should have enough 
intelligence to appreciate good material. 

If I may refer further to the September 
issue so long after — it is new here — the 
story “Incident” by Rex and Elizabeth 
Levie, re the Cain and Abel theme seems 
to have reversed its polarities. In the Bib- 
lical story, Abel was the hunter and/or 



herdsman, and his gifts were flesh, not 
fruit, while Cain’s vegetable products were 
not acceptable sacrifices, whence he raged 
and slew Abel. On the broader field, we 
find the cultivators ousting and killing the 
hunters, who, contrary to “logical” beliefs, 
were less warlike. In Africa the Hereros 
suffered thus, and earlier the hunting and 
gathering Bushmen. (Hunting and gather- 
ing normally go together). The maize 
tribes, e.g. ; Iroquois, pursued the “hidden 
children” like the Mohicans. In New Zea- 
land the kumara cultivating tribes outsted 
and slaughtered the hunters and gather- 
ers, as in this region. It is significant that 
the trappers lived on reasonable terms 
with the Plains Indians, but when the 
farmers came, war became relentless. 
Maurice Walsh tried to make out that the 
meat-eating Highlanders were better war- 
riors than the oat-fed Lowlanders, but in 
the Montrose campaigns, the sudden 
dashes were no match for the dour and 
persistent fighters they found themselves 
up against. It is something like persistent 
and dangerous buffalo against sudden but 
lazy lions. 

It is those beliefs which seem most 
self-evident that usually most need ques- 
tioning and research into what actually 
happens. In science fiction particularly, 
the views that most need illustrating in fic- 
tional form are unusual insights from real- 
ity, rather than the already shopworn “ob- 
vious.” The “obvious” usually tells more 
about a prevailing mental atmosphere than 
about reality. — Which is why I find the 
assumptions of that story out of tune with 
a fresh wind which is already blowing in 
Science Fiction. Isn’t this supposed to be 
the time for a high point in the S.F. 
cycle? Anyway, carry on with the good 
work. 

Yours cordially, 
Alistair M. Isdale

peoples but to much earlier types of 
hominids — the inventors of the essentially 
carnivorous tool-as-weapon versus the es- 
sentially herbivorous inventors of the 
tool-as-digger/chopper. The progeny of the 
former still exist (us) while the latter group 
is of interest solely to the anthro- 
paleontologists. 

Dear gentleperson, 

The only comparable sadness I can re- 
member in my many years of reading SF 
magazines is the discontinuance of 
Venture, which for all its virtues, lasted 
less than a year. 1 am probably one of the 
few people around who have read every 
single one of the 175 issues of IF and thus 
can fully appreciate what is now lost. I 
first started reading SF mags when I was 
ten in 1956, but didn’t discover IF until 
1956. Poking through the piles of junk at a 
local (Painesville Ohio — according to my 
myth Harlan Ellison's hometown as well) 
junk store I discovered several back years 
of IF and GALAXY and set out to find the 
rest. In those days, before real collectors 



had made it impossible, a fourteen year 
old boy could still do this. Although IF 
had its goodly number of failures (particu- 
larly the years before your current editor- 
ship) which almost caused me to stop buy- 
ing, in general its high quality often made 
the entire field bearable. 

I don’t know how this decision was 
reached, but 1 wish that those of us who 
have provided the solid core of SF buyers 
over the years (I have probably bought 
90% of all major pb publishers lists and all 
non-reprint mags for fifteen years) could 
have been consulted about this step. I 
have always resisted subscribing, since 1 
have felt that my purchases would insure 
at least one local outlet, but certainly I 
would have been willing to support some 
kind of substaining subscription if that 
catagory were necessary. Those of us in 
the solid core will buy at virtually any 
pric*e.

of four books for just 100. You may examine 
them in your home, and if not completely 
satisfied, return them within ten days — 
membership will be cancelled and you’ll
