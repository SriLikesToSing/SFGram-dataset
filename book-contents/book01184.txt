his bleak dark face. 



formula. “Shade. I’m here to meet 



“Respected Benefactor!” 

A busy traffic inspector had rec- 
ognized him even without the red 
uniform and the silver crescent of 
his lunar fellowship, which he had 
put off for the plain gray kilt of the 
Game clan. 

“Rain and shade!” The black in- 
spector shouted that hearty Sand 
clan greeting. “We range the desert 
together.” 

I range alone. 

In no mood for courtesy, he 
pushed rudely on until he saw that 
wide grin fading. The man’s hurt 



a passenger. ’ ’ 

“Share my tent, sir.” Relieved, 
the inspector bustled up to brush 
palms with him. “I saw you fight 
in the arena, sir. Before you had a 
name. In fact, I lost twelve gongs 
on you.” Admiration flashed in the 
grin. “The unknown challenger 
from the gutters of Nggonggamba! I 
never expected you to win — but I 
would have bet another dozen gongs 
that you would never become the 
Benefactor. Our first citizen!” 

No longer. 

The unspoken thought lay bitter 



5 




on his tongue. A dozen dozen days 
ago, when Snowfire left, he had 
been named the resident Benefactor. 
That high post had been the goal of 
all his years of training on Xyr, and 
cruel emotion tore him now that he 
had to give it up. 

“I see you’re troubled, sir,” the 
inspector humbled. ‘‘Nggongga 
hatches no end of hard dilemmas, 
and they all fall upon you. I know 
that each starving clansman wander- 
ing into the city makes a new bur- 
den for you. But the Benefactors 
are our last great hope. We trust 
you, sir!” 

More than I trust myself. 

He didn’t want to say that he was 
surrendering his high position just 
to follow a girl who had left him. 
Wryly silent, he recalled the term in 
the Game clan dialect for such 
hopeless expeditions. “White tly 
hunts.” There were no white tlys. 

Disconcerted by his moodiness, 
the man was turning away. 

“Find water.” Forcing a smile, 
he groped for words of graceful 
gratitude. “Find peace.” 

“Water!” Happy again, the in- 
spector dropped to one knee in the 
ritual bow of a departing junior. 
“Peace!” 

He bustled away. 

Blacklantern stalked somberly on 
to wait for Thomwall at the arrival 
stage beneath the space gate. He 
knew that the stare of the gate was 
nothing more than an optical illu- 
sion created by the transport fields, 
but in his dark mood it seemed to 
watch him like the eye of God. 

Lidless and enormous, the seem- 
ing eye peered out of involute 
space-time. The blue-glowing con- 
trol fields were its iris. The pupil, 

6 



framed in that queerly painful 
shimmer of dimensionless energy, 
was the interface itself — the cosmic 
short cut to myriad worlds. 

Uneasily, he kept shifting along 
the guard rail beside the exit strip. 
The eye always followed. Its huge 
black disk seemed to probe through 
all his poor defenses of uncertain 
status and unstable purpose to find 
the naked black street urchin he 
once had been. 

It made him feel several sorts of 
fool. 

The giant pupil winked. Half a 
heartbeat from the far-off planet of 
the Benefactors, Thomwall emerged 
from the reflected cosmic dark. A 
tall commanding man, robed in 
formal red. He flashed his ensign at 
the guards and swung off the transit 
strip, stem face searching. 

Blacklantern started to meet him, 
but faltered. His ageless ice-blue 
eyes were too much like that appal- 
ling orb through which he had 
come. When he found Blacklantern, 
however, all his sternness thawed 
into an easy smile. Lifting two fin- 
gers in the fellowship salute, he 
paused with a look of mild inquiry. 

“I wish you were angry, sir.” 
Stiffly, Blacklantern returned his sa- 
lute. “You ought to be. I’ve let you 
down.” 

“You know you’re always free to 
leave the fellowship.” Thomwall’s 
level gaze was still disturbing, but 
his quiet tone showed no resent- 
ment. “We never coerce anybody.” 

“I can’t help feeling disloyd.” 
The implacable stare of that giant 
eye drove Blacklantern to confes- 
sion. “I remember you took me out 
of jail. You made me a Benefactor. 
You gave me knowledge and power 

GALAXY 




I had never dreamed of — the chance 
to share the gifts of progress with 
all my people. I know I’ve failed, 
and I feel wretched about it.” 

“What went wrong?” 

“Two — two problems.” Beneath 
that ruthless gaze, his words stum- 
bled. “You’ll meet one of them, 
waiting outside. The other is Snow- 
fire.” 

“You can forget her.” 

“The trouble is, I can’t forget.” 
“I knew you were lovers.” Prob- 
ing him, Thornwall’s pale old eyes 
seemed as omniscient as the gate- 
way. “That’s why we left the two 
of you together here after your es- 
cape from the Game clan hunters. 
When she left, I supposed the affair 
was over.” 

“Not for me.” 

He stopped uncomfortably, but 
Thomwall simply stood waiting. 

“We had different notions of 
what love is. When Engineer 
Toolsmith brought us out of the de- 
sert after the hunt, she fell for him. 
She wanted us both. Being 
Nggonggan, I was jealous. She called 
me selfish. We hurt each other. 
When he went back to Swarmworld 
One, I let her go with him — though 
I thought she wanted me to beg her 
to stay. I felt too — too proud for 
that.” 

He bit his lip, with a grimace of 
pain. 

“I was wrong,” he muttered. “A 
wrong-headed fool! I’m going after 
her now. I’ll beg her, if I must, to 
let me Join them.” 

“You can’t get there,” 
Thomwall told him. “Swarmworld 
One is nearly five thousand light- 
years away. The star gates to it 
have all been closed.” 

THE ETERNITY ENGINE 



“I can try — ” 

“Trying won’t help. The 
swarmworlders aren’t cooperative. 
We have an old philosophic quarrel 
with them, about culture contacts. 
As Benefactors, we try to help 
primitive races adapt to new 
technologies. The swarmworlders 
feel that alien technologies are de- 
structive. They have always kept 
their culture to themselves.” 

“I know they don’t like 
visitors — ” 

But / have a plan. 

He didn’t say the words, because 
his plan was too desperate. He 
didn’t want Thomwall laughing at 
him. 

“Snowfire’s gone.” With a shrug 
that dismissed her utterly, 
Thomwall swung toward the exit 
strips. “You’re still here. The 
Benefactor of Nggongga.” 

“I was,” he said. “You’ll see 
why I’m quitting.” 

When Thomwall’s luggage was 
routed to the agency compound, 
they rode out of the terminal into 
the brassy noon of Nggonggamba. 
Though the “white night” was al- 
most over, the traffic ways were 
still abandoned to savage sunlight. 
Blind in the glare, Blacklantern 
heard angry native voices and the 
slap of calloused native feet. 

“Watch them, sir!” he whis- 
pered. “They’re desperate!” 

A score of nearly naked blacks 
came rushing at them from the 
shadow of the dome. A gaunt crip- 
ple, lurching on clumsy lancegrass 
crutches. A reeling woman, 
skeleton-thin, with a still baby in 
her arms. A huge-eyed child run- 
ning ahead, holding out a bright na- 
tive hat for a begging bowl. 

7 




“They’re — dreadful!’’ Thomwall 
was thumbing coins from his belt. 
“Let’s give them something.” 

“Careful, sir!’’ Blacklantern 
murmured. “Let me do it.” 

“You call yourselves Benefac- 
tors?” The woman shrieked her ac- 
cusation in a desert dialect. “You 
travel to the stars and do the work 
of gods — but look at my child.” 
Her withered black hands held out 
the dead infant. “Why won’t you 
share with us?” 

“We do share.” He took 
Thomwall’s coins and flung them 
out across the pavement. “We try 
to — forgive us!” 

Most of the mob ran to scrabble 
for the coins, snarling over them 
like ravenous animals. The woman 
stood swaying, the bloated baby in 
her stretched-out arms. Its odor 
turned him ill. 

“Come, sir!” He hurried 
Thomwall toward the nearest pas- 
senger way. “You’ll see our trou- 
bles here. Attacks in the public 
ways. Pickets at the agency. Hatred 
I can’t endure. The people scream- 
ing for food. Their leaders trying to 
blame us for all that’s wrong with 
Nggongga — and more going wrong 
every day.” 

“Patience.” Gently, the old man 
smiled. “Our task was never easy.” 

“Impossible!” he muttered. 
“Here on Nggongga. The starving 
mobs are after our heads, and the 
police can’t — or won’t — protect 
us.” 

A second crowd of shouting 
blacks had sprung from nowhere be- 
fore they reached the ramp. A slim 
young girl hawking desert flowers. 
Grimy boys clamoring to clean their 
boots. Shrieking sellers of bright- 

8 



dyed incense sticks and mildewed 
muskweed pods and burnt clay 
charms against Cru Creetha. One 
blind crone followed the pack, of- 
fering a worn-out rug of woven 
nearman hair. 

“Make way!” Blacklantern 
pushed through them. “Make way 
for the respected senior Benefac- 
tor. ’ ’ 

"Tleeshl” A tly-stung arena vet- 
eran shoved past him, thrusting a 
twisted claw at Thomwall. “Share 
life!” 

Jostled, the Benefactor tripped 
over a boot-cleaner’s box. The 
horde closed around him. The old 
tly-fighter bent as if to help — and 
slammed him viciously back against 
the pavement. The flower girl 
snatched at his belt suddenly and 
ran. 

"OongathV' Blacklantern called 
that Game clan warning of ritual re- 
venge and plunged into the mob. 
The tly-fighter met him with a cun- 
ning kick at the groin. Twisting 
aside, he saw a dagger flash. 

“Tleeshl” A dirty urchin mocked 
him with that old appeal for desert 
hospitality. A thrown boot-box 
grazed his head. The owners jeered 
him with his own battle cry, “Oon- 
gath! OongathV'' 

The sense of crisis lit a bright 
elation in him, and awoke his old 
arena skills. Smiling into the sun, 
he whipped off his belt for a bind- 
ing rope. One quick flick drew his 
attacker’s eyes, while he drived for 
the dagger. In another moment the 
stung man lay squealing on the 
pavement, bound like a defeated 
tly. 

He gripped the captured dagger 
and whirled. 



GALAXY 




Suddenly silent, the mob melted 
away. Two frightened boys scuttled 
to recover the box they had thrown. 
The evil reek of the dead baby still 
tainted the stifling air. 

Thomwall stood up, rubbing his 
bruises. 

“My ensign!” he whispered. 
“Gone.” 

“Guard yourself.” Blacklantern 
gave him the dagger. “I’ll get it 
back.” 

Thumbing his own ensign to call 
the police, he started after the 
flower girl. She had paused to look 
back. When she s^w him following, 
she flung the stolen ensign at him 
and fled again. He brought it back 
to Thomwall. 

“My people!” He opened his 
arms in a gesture of futility. “My 
own people! As a Benefactor, I was 
trying to bring them progress — or 
anyhow to help them survive it. But 
they’re too many for me. Too ig- 
norant. Too hungry. Too savage.” 

“That’s why they need us.” 

“The job’s too much for me.” 
He scowled moodily down at the 
bound man and turned wearily back 
to Thomwall. “I have a stereogram 
from Snowfire. Her farewell mes- 
sage from the swarmworld, just be- 
fore the gates were closed. I want 
you to hear her — she says we Bene- 
factors have been wrong.” 

“On some worlds we have failed. 
We may fail here.” Thomwall nod- 
ded calmly. “Mankind has one 
great enemy, that we can never 
completely defeat — man himself.” 
With age-yellowed hands, he held 
up the dagger as if for evidence. 
“All the human traits that served us 
in the jungle can betray us in so- 
ciety. Yet we must preserve them. 

THE ETERNITY ENGINE 



The same dark forces that threaten 
us are also the bright springs 
of our creative evolution. That an- 
cient blackness sometimes kills 
us — but sometimes it transforms us. 
The paradox now and then defeats 
us — but sometimes we win. The 
human universe is better than it 
would have been without the Bene- 
factors.” 

“I wonder — ” But he saw 
Thomwall’s pain, and checked him- 
self. “Let’s get on,” he said. “Be- 
fore the police come. These people 
will accuse us. We could be the 
ones hauled in.” 

He released his captive, who 
stalked sullenly back toward the 
shadow of the dome. 

“Let’s hear Snowfire.” 
Thomwall stood blinking into the 
searing glare and swaying unstead- 
ily, as if Nggongga had been too 
much for him. “Somewhere out of 
the sun.” 

II 

The still- abandoned ways car- 
ried them out of the portal zone to a 
Sea clan wineshop where they took 
refuge from the white night in a 
cool dim booth. When the waitress 
was gone, Blacklantern twisted the 
base of the little black message disk 
and set it on the table before them. 

Snowfire’s silver image flickered in 
its focal cone and came alive with 
sudden color. Her green-gold eyes 
smiled sadly at him. 

“Dear Blackie — ” Her low- 
pitched voice woke memories that 
still blurred his. eyes with tears. 
“I’m deeply grieved that we can 
never meet again. Never touch. 
Never love. But I guess we’ve 

9 




made our choices. You couldn’t ac- 
cept the customs of my folk. I 
wouldn’t accept the ways of yours. 

“Anyhow, this will be our last 
contact. Swarmworld One is closing 
all its external gates. Indefinitely, 
Toolsmith says. I suppose you’ll 
wonder why. The reason is some- 
thing I can only hint at. A cultural 
quantum jump. A radical new solu- 
tion to the population problem. 

“I wish I could say more. I’ve 
been asking for details to send back 
to the Benefactors, but you know 
the swarmworld philosophy. My 
hosts are afraid their new technol- 
ogy might damage other cultures. 
Perhaps they’re right. Anyhow, it is 
something too far advanced to be 
useful on Nggongga.’’ 

Her image moved in the cone, 
and red fire played across her hair. 
He trembled, fighting the blind de- 
sire to reach, to catch and hold her 
golden loveliness. 

“So this is our final farewell. I 
wanted to say again that I do love 
you, Blackie. In my own way — I 
still wish it had been yours too. It 
saddens me to think of you left to 
waste your life on the pathetic little 
projects of the Benefactors, doomed 
as you are to suffer and die in the 
darkness of Nggongga. I still 
wish — wish — ’ ’ 

Her voice had quivered, and the 
cone flickered as if she had erased a 
moment of emotion. 

“Don’t forget me, Blackie!’’ 
Suddenly she was dazzling. “I want 
you to know that I’m utterly happy. 
Eager to test this startling new in- 
vention. If Toolsmith’s promises are 
true, our new world will be more 
wonderful than anything you 
ever pictured for a paradise. 

10 



“Good — Goody-by, Blackie!’’ 

Her eyes had darkened with feel- 
ing, and he caught the green glint 
of a tear as her image dimmed. The 
disk clicked faintly and the empty 
shadow-cone winked out. 

Blacklantern sat gazing dully at 
nothing. She had looked real 
enough to touch, and he could still 
imagine her sweetleaf fragrance lin- 
gering in the booth. All his own 
brash confidence had faded with her 
image, and the gloom around him 
grew darker now with his own 
awareness of the tragedy of 
Nggongga. 

He had almost forgotten that he 
was not alone, and it startled him a 
little when Thomwall moved. The 
old Benefactor looked as fragile as 
another shadow in the cone, but his 
thin old voice was strangely serene. 

“So we’ve lost Snowfire.’’ He 
leaned calmly forward to refill their 
glasses. “It takes a rare sort of per- 
son to remain a Benefactor. But 
we’re still physicians to mankind. 
So long as men nqed help to deal 
with progress, we’ll go on — ’’ 

“Without me.’’ Impatiently, 
Blacklantern swept his glass aside 
and stood. 

“I’m going to follow Snowfire.’’ 

“You heard her say all the gates 
are closed.’’ 

“But I think I’ve found a way.” 
Eagerness lifted his voice. “En- 
gineer Toolsmith was here, you 
know, to mine Nggongga for the 
swarmworld — without too much 
concern at that time about what 
happened to the natives. The mine 
is abandoned now. With this new 
invention, perhaps our planet is no 
longer needed. 

“Anyhow, I’ve earned a name in 

GALAXY 




the Game clan and my new friends 
tell me the mining machinery is still 
lying there, abandoned in the pit. I 
hope to get to the swarmworld, 
through the gates that took the ore. 

“Don’t laugh at me!” 

Thomwall’s breath had caught. 

“I’m not laughing — but you 
make me wish I were young 
again.” A brief smile twitched his 
parchment lips. “If our mission 
here on Nggongga is too much for 
you, I think you’ll find the way to 
Snowfire ten times harder.” 

“I’ll take the risks.” 

“Have you really faced the 
odds?” 

“I’ve had nightmares about 
them.” 

“You’ve no chance at all.” 
Thornwall’s face was sadly stem. 
“You’re a primitive. You’ll be lost 
in the most advanced culture 
known — the swarmworld has been 
evolving new technologies for 
twenty thousand years. You don’t 
know the folkways. Not even the 
language.” 

He had to nod in uneasy agree- 
ment. 

“Even if you get there, how will 
you find her? The swarmworlders 
have been exploding into space for 
dozens of generations. The swarm 
is many billion life-spheres, all in 
orbit. Each one holds as many 
people as a planet. Looking for her, 
you’ll be like a blind man searching 
all the deserts of Nggongga for one 
special grain of sand.” 

Blacklantem stiffened impatient- 
ly. “I’ve met swarmworlders be- 
fore. I’ve even killed one. 
Ooldforge. The manager of their 
mine here — when he was hunting 
my head in the desert. I have his 

THE ETERNITY ENGINE 



translator and his name ring. I have 
Snowfire’s swarmworld address — 
probably Toolsmith’s home — from 
the label of the stereogram. I even 
have money, from selling a few 
trinkets I’ll never need again.” 

“I drink to your enterprise!” 
Thomwall raised his glass, with a 
quick ironic smile. “Even though I 
think you wouldn’t be going if you 
had attacked your problems here 
with this sort of spirit.” 

Blacklantem gulped his wine and 
said nothing. 

“Is she really worth so much?” 
Cold again, the old eyes probed 
him. “Your whole career as a Bene- 
factor? All our hopes for the fu- 
ture of your people?” 

“I’ve tried to be rational.” 
Blacklantem scowled at the dead 
message disk. “I used to laugh at 
the love-crazed heroes in our old 
epics. I know there are women 
enough on Nggongga — girls my 
own color, sharing my own culture, 
fit for anything. I even know Snow- 
fire will never be entirely mine, 
wherever I find her. ’ ’ 

He spread his hands in a native 
gesture of submission. 

“But — you see, sir — I can’t help 
how I feel. She — she’s burnt into 
my brain. The image of her festers 
in me like a barbed desert thorn. 
Not that I want to forget!” 

For a moment they sat silent. A 
lazy fan above them stirred the 
scents of stale wine and rancid 
musk and black sweat. Glasses 
clinked somewhere in the steamy 
gloom, and a girl laughed. 

“You trouble me.” Thomwall 
pushed the pottery bottle aside. 
“You and Snowfire. Top agents. 
People I trusted — loved. Doing 

11 




something very foolish, that I can’t 
understand.” 

“I know how to fight a tly.” 
Blacklantem paused uncomfortably. 
“Nggongga is harder to handle. I 
guess I’ve just lost faith. In the Bene- 
factors. Even in myself.” 

He saw the hurt in Thomwall’s 
eyes, and still went on. 

‘‘I believe the swarmworld 
philosophy is right. Nggongga must 
have been a better place before the 
eye was ever opened. My people 
had their own way of living, shaped 
and tested by a dozen dozen genera- 
tions.” 

“Yet they were quick enough to 
give it up,” Thomwall said. “Just 
watch them now, leaving their des- 
ert trails and their old mud towns 
to flock into Nggonggamba. ” 

“The city seems to draw them, 
as flames draw night-moths.” He 
nodded and paused to think. “The 
unbreakable problem is the people 
explosion. The old clan system here 
was a working answer to it — each 
clan owned only a limited list of 
names, and nameless men were not 
allowed to marry. The younger sons 
had a hard choice — the priesthood 
or the tly arena. But at least they 
knew who they were.” 

He made a face, as if the wine 
were bitter. 

“The opening of the eye has 
wrecked all that. The clans are 
breaking up. The old traditions are 
thrown away, the old gods forgot- 
ten. Progress has betrayed us. We 
wipe out old diseases with the mira- 
cle medicines — and breed more 
people than the planet can feed. We 
buy bright new atomic pumps to ir- 
rigate our croplands — and dry up 
the geologic water under the old 

12 



oases. In flight from the spreading 
deserts, we follow the promise of 
progress into Nggonggamba — and 
die in the streets.” 

He pushed his glass aside, to lean 
across the table. 

“Tell me what I could have 
done,” he challenged Thomwall. 
“As resident Benefactor, after 
Snowfire left, I was alone here. 
With no power over anybody. Tell 
me what one man can do for two 
hundred million. For hordes of hun- 
gry people like those who tried to 
rob us. They can’t eat culture or so- 
cial theory or even benevolent inten- 
tions.” 

“We can’t help people,” 
Thomwall objected patiently. “We 
learned that long ago. You have 
millions here demanding food — 
when there isn’t that much food. 
Even if you somehow fed them, 
you would have twice as many mil- 
lions in another generation, twice as 
desperate. It may seem cmel, but 
all you can do is tell them how to 
help themselves.” 

“If they’re too- hungry to 
listen — ” 

“We always find a few to listen. 
We train those few to teach and 
lead the rest. Better than food, we 
can offer membership in the new 
galactic culture. We can build a 
university, design a planetary lan- 
guage, plan a new government. 
Rather than food alone, we bring 
knowledge and purpose- and hope. 
We lead the way to a new social 
discipline.” 

“If people won’t follow — ” 

“We can’t compel anybody — but 
the facts of nature can.” Thomwall 
straightened sternly. “If you 
Nggonggans could keep on doubling 

GALAXY 




your numbers with every genera- 
tion, in only six thousand years the 
whole mass of the universe would 
be black flesh. If we Benefactors 
have authority, it comes from such 
harsh brute facts.” 

‘‘I tried.” Blacklantern shrugged. 
‘‘I’m through.” 

Suddenly smiling, he leaned to 
pick up the black message disk. 

‘‘All I want is Snowfire.” 

‘‘I don’t think you’ll find her.” 
Yet Thomwall’s smile reflected his 
own. “If you do reach the 
swarmworld, I want to know that 
new solution to the people problem. 
I thought the swarmfolk already had 
the final answer, with all their 
available mass built into space 
vehicles and all their solar energy 
trapped and utilized. I can’t 
imagine anything better.” 

“I’ll try to learn their answer. 
But I don’t expect to be coming 
back.” 

“Good hunting, anyhow!” Bright 
youth had come back to 
Thomwall’s deep-sunk eyes, and he 
lifted his glass with a flourish. “We 
trained you well on Xyr. Perhaps 
you’ll make it!” 

Ill 

LACKLANTERN gave up his en- 
sign that afternoon, though 
Thornwall still protested. He outfit- 
ted himself at a manhunter’s shop. 
Next morning, wearing Goldforge’s 
name ring and translator, he set out 
on a chartered flight south toward 
the old hunting lands of the Game 
clan. 

His pilot was a nervous little 
mud-colored man, a compulsive 
chewer of saltflower seed, a com- 
pulsive worrier about the voltage 
drop in his reserve power cell, a 

THE ETERNITY ENGINE 



compulsive talker about his Sea clan 
wife and his nine unmarried 
daughters, two of them unaccount- 
ably pregnant. 

Only half listening, Blacklantern 
was scanning his route map and the 
unrolling desert. At last he found 
the narrow green oasis where the 
ritual hunts had begun. He picked 
out the bare red mesas he and 
Snowfire had crossed, the ripple of 
yellow dunes where Goldforge had 
overtaken them, the flows of black 
lava beyond, and the white blaze of 
the dry salt lake where the body 
hunters had finally brought them to 
bay. 

Beneath the flyer, all their end- 
less days and nights of love and 
pain were telescoped into meaning- 
less moments. There was the last 
red ridge — where the world broke 
off. Beyond it, sheer cliffs of brok- 
en sandstone lipped a pit too vast 
to show any farther rim. 

The brown pilot fell abruptly si- 
lent. 

He leaned against the window, 
looking for the bottom of the pit. 
He found rubble slopes, level 
shelves, deeper slopes and steeper 
cliffs. What he discovered at last, 
miles and miles below, was no bot- 
tom, but the tops of towering 
clouds, floating out of a hazy void. 

“Do you want to land on the 
rim, sir?” The pilot still thought he 
had come to hunt wild nearmen. 
“Our agreement doesn’t cover spot- 
ting or shooting from the air.” 

“We aren’t landing here,” he 
said. “We’re flying down inside.” 

Profanely, the pilot called the 
name of dark Cru Creetha, eater of 
suns. His flyer had been chartered 
for a flight to the pit, not into it. Of 

13 




course, personally, he was not 
afraid to fly anywhere. The Sun 
Lighter would bear witness to his 
courage. But he was legally obli- 
gated to adhere strictly to the terms 
of their official flight plan. 

“I’ll double the charter price,” 
Blacklantern offered. “If you’ll 
land me near one of the old mining 
machines down inside.” 

The pilot’s muddy color faded. 
He had heard all he wanted to know 
about the great metal worms the 
swarmwoflders had sent to eat up 
the planet, and he was already closer 
to them than he wanted to be. 

The old excavators were stopped 
and abandoned, Blacklantern . said. 
They couldn’t harm anybody. 

So I hope, he told himself. 

The pilot crunched another 
saltflower seed. Muttering huskily 
through froth-purpled lips, he said 
he must consider not only the 
alarming signs of failure in the re- 
serve power cell and his duty to his 
wife and daughters, but also the 
terms of his flight insurance. 

Blacklantern estimated the funds 
he had left. Gates and gongs would 
be useless, he supposed, in the 
swarmworld, and he wasn’t coming 
back. He offered to triple the char- 
ter fee. 

The pilot munched thoughtfully 
and spurted purple fluid at the cabin 
floor. Squinting shrewdly across 
that jagged brink into the cloudy 
depths, he announced that another 
gross of gongs would complete the 
dot for his first daughter. Blacklan- 
tem paid him, and they dived. 

They found the excavator lying 
on a black granite ledge. A small 
bright worm, it swelled and swelled 
beneath them to become a mile-long 

14 



monster. The pilot set the flyer 
down at a Judicious distance, and 
Blacklantern scrambled out with his 
hunting gear. 

“I’ll wait overnight,” the pilot 
offered, “For six gross of gongs.” 

“Don’t wait.” 

“You can’t live here. You can’t 
climb out.” The pilot peered uneas- 
ily up at the slopes of broken stone 
and the fracture-carved precipices 
and the broken benches that made a 
giant’s stairway toward the far sky. 
“I’ll come back in three days — for 
another triple fee.” 

“I don’t have the money,” 
Blacklantern said. “I’m taking the 
excavator out.” 

Chewing hard, the pilot blinked 
up at the monstrous metal mass and 
took off hastily. 

From the lip of that wide ledge, 
Blacklantern looked down into the 
pit. Though the jagged rim that 
framed the narrow scrap of sky was 
miles and miles above, his rocky 
ledge was less than halfway down. 
The clouds that hid the bottom were 
still far beneath his level. Lightning 
flickered in them now, and an end- 
less peal of thunder began crashing 
and rumbling and rolling away 
against those looming walls. 

He turned to watch the flyer 
climb. Dwindling fast, it was only a 
black insect before it reached the 
top of the first talus slope. Before it 
rose above the first black granite 
wall, he had lost it. 

He stood there alone. 

His neck hurt from looking up, 
and he couldn’t help a tiny shiver 
from his shattering sense of the vast- 
ness of the pit and the power of the 
swarmfolk who had abandoned it so 
casually. Perhaps he had been a 



GALAXY 




fool to let the flyer go, but he had 
no time for fear. He hitched up his 
hunting pack and hiked toward the 
excavator. 

The cautious pilot had left him a 
long way to hike. He was sweating 
before he reached the great 
machine. Its curved armor swelled 
out far above him, scarred from 
titantic rockfalls, bright and massive 
and impregnable. Under its shadow, 
he plodded on toward its rock- 
crushing jaws. 

A new rockslide had half-buried 
the machine since it stopped. Huge 
fallen boulders faced him with sheer 
cliffs as grim as any he had con- 
quered long ago, hunting nestling 
tlys. It cost him a hard hour’s 
climbing to reach the rotary teeth of 
the excavator. 

In the echoing cavern behind those 
enormous metal molars, he used 
his hunting lantern to pick a way 
along the titanic conveyor that had 
carried broken stone back to the 
transflection portal. A blue light 
flashed suddenly ahead. 

Alert to the danger of toppling 
into some ore-bin or smelter in the 
far-off swarmworld, he took that for 
a warning. Climbing off the con- 
veyor, he explored great strange 
mechanisms until he found a railed 
inspection walk that led him at last 
into a high control booth. 

Lights came on, when he closed 
the door. One wall turned transpar- 
ent to show him a bright picture of 
the swarmworld — a tiny blue sun 
wrapped in a milky mist of life- 
spheres, each invisibly small. A 
long panel against the opposite wall 
glowed with symbols he couldn’t 
read. 

The third wall framed a dark 



opening beyond a level ramp. When 
he walked toward it, new lights 
picked out a little vehicle without 
wheels, somehow suspended just 
above a wide black track. Its trans- 
parent shell showed half a dozen 
seats inside. 

Trembling now with the same 
breathless sense of risk and elation 
he had felt when he faced his first 
diving tly, he pulled at its oval 
door. The door stayed fast — but, 
beside it, an amber-circled sensor 
began to blink. 

He stopped for a moment, frown- 
ing. Any error, now, could be as 
quickly fatal as a false move in the 
arena. Yet this was clearly the 
transport system of the vanished 
miners. The vehicle promised to 
cany him to the swarmworld, while 
the blinking sensor seemed to ques- 
tion his right to go. 

He caught his breath and 
thumbed Goldforge’s name-ring to 
flash its color-coded signal ray into 
the black center of the sensor. The 
amber circle quit blinking. The door 
slid open. Light came on inside the 
crystal shell. Heart thudding, he 
stepped inside. 

The door clicked shut behind 
him. 

He waited, almost afraid to 
breathe. Nothing happened until he 
slid warily into the nearest seat. 
Then a soft bell-note rang, and a 
bank of keys shone green on an 
oval panel beside his seat. Most of 
the symbols that marked them were 
strange, but he saw that two of 
them were numerals, oddly shaped, 
like those on the label of Snowfire’s 
stereogram. 

He sat for a moment thinking, 
muscles as taut as when he first had 



THE ETERNITY ENGINE 



15 




to judge the strike of a screaming 
tly. Hopefully, then, he began using 
the portal print on the label to trans- 
late the green symbols, punching 
out what he hoped would be Snow- 
fire’s swarmworld address. 

The life-sphere number — or was 
it? As he touched the last digit, the 
panel chimed faintly and one green 
key turned golden. Elated and more 
anxious, he stabbed out what he 
thought should be the level number. 

A higher note chimed. Another 
symboled key changed color. With 
a heady sense of success, as if he 
had discovered the blind side of a 
dangerous tly, he tried the octant 
number. Another rising chime. 
Another golden glow. 

He kept tapping, his whole body 
cold with sweat and quivering. The 
sector number. The zone number. 
The corridor number. At last, the 
dwelling number. Its final digit star- 
tled him with a deep-toned gong 
and a flashing crimson symbol. 

He froze, as if an unseen tly had 
bellowed above him. While he 
stood wondering what to do, a tone- 
less synthetic voice hummed from 
the panel. 

“ — transposed.” Goldforge’s 
translator picked it up. “Dwelling 
no longer occupied. Access re- 
stricted. Revised destination instruc- 
tions required.” 

All his muscles tightened, but he 
had nothing for them to do. 

“Request — ” His voice failed, 
and he had to catch his breath. 
“Request destination information. 
New address of — of last occupants. 
Of Benefactor Snowfire and En- 
gineer Toolsmith.” 

For an endless second, nothing 
happened. 

16 



“Benefactor Snowfire not iden- 
tified,” that dead voice droned at 
last. “Engineer Toolsmith trans- 
posed. No local dwelling in use. 
Revised destination instructions re- 
quired.” 

Grimly, he tried to slow his 
drumming heart. 

“Request assistance,” he called 
again. “Required destination is cur- 
rent address of Engineer Toolsmith, 
former occupant of destination first 
requested.” 

For longer seconds, there was no 
response. 

“Body of Engineer Toolsmith lo- 
cated,” the machine purred sudden- 
ly. “Revised destination will be 
Ironforge Clinic of Exotic Patho- 
logy, Sphere 101011100, Level 
1100101, Octant 101, Sector 
1010101, Zone 11100, Corridor 
noon. Dwelling 11001010. Pre- 
pare for departure.” 

He sank back in the seat with a 
gasp of relief. 

The crimson winking stopped. A 
triple chime rang. Silently, the crys- 
tal capsule swept forward into a 
gray-walled tunnel. Ahead, a giant 
eye widened. 

He shrank in spite of himself 
from its blue-rimmed blackness. 

The vehicle toppled down its 
track, through the painful depthless 
flicker of the iris, into the flat 
enormous pupil. The cavernous 
belly of the excavator was instantly 
five thousand light-years behind. 
The vehicle swayed and fell again, 
through another gray tunnel and into 
a stranger space. 

For a heart-clutching moment, he 
felt weightless. The capsule tipped 
up h steeply climbing track. As it 
gained speed, his sense of weight 

GALAXY 




came back. He caught his breath 
and tried to see where he was. 

On his left, a dark wall was 
blurred smooth by his motion. On the 
right, he looked out into a hollow 
cylinder, its dimensions too vast for 
him to estimate. Mottled blue and 
green, its far-away curve was below 
and above and all around him. Its 
farther end was lost in misty dis- 
tance. 

The cylinder seemed to roll be- 
neath his racing vehicle, spinning 
around him at a giddy rate. A wave 
of vertigo swept him. Clutching at 
the seat ahead, he groped for his 
lost orientation. Though he sup- 
posed the life-sphere must be ro- 
tated to create a centrifugal sub- 
stitute for gravity, he knew it 
couldn’t be spinning so crazily. 

Most of the actual motion, he 
soon decided, was that of his own 
capsule, plunging around and 
around a spiral track built into the 
near end of the cylinder, carrying 
him away from its axis toward the 
wall. 

This long hollow, then, must be 
only the core of the huge life- 
sphere. The inhabited levels would 
be farther from the axis, where the 
centrifugal pull was stronger. 

His giddiness gone, he looked 
“down” again at the endless racing 
landscape. Now, as it came nearer, 
he could see that the green areas 
were grassland and forest, the blue 
patches lakes and streams. Here at 
the heart of this enormous mechani- 
cal world, the swarmfolk had made 
a place for nature. 

Eagerly, he began searching for 
people. 

Soon he was able to pick out the 
boles of odd-shaped flowering trees. 

THE ETERNITY ENGINE 



He saw winged things flying, fat 
quadrupeds grazing, a sleek black 
creature stalking one of them. He 
caught a glimpse of what looked 
like playground equipment in an 
empty park on a wide lake beach. 
Graceful robotic devices were busy 
here and there, but he found no 
human beings. 

Perhaps the swarmfolk were 
sleeping. 

At the level of that deserted land- 
scape, the capsule flashed past a 
vacant passenger platform and 
dropped into another tunnel. A new 
gong chimed, and the whole nose of 
the vehicle was filled with the 
stereo image of a half-transparent 
ball, wide triangular wings flaring 
from its poles. 

Deep inside it, a bright green 
point was crawling. When he found 
the hollow core, and all the curving 
shells around it, he suddenly under- 
stood the the ball was the life- 
sphere, that the creeping point fol- 
lowed his own position. 

Now and then some light or sig- 
nal flashed backward along the tun- 
nel wall, but the capsule was so 
soundless that he thought it must be 
moving in a vacuum. He felt star- 
tled when it lurched and stopped, 
with a wheeze of air. The map 
winked out. A mellow gong rang. 

“Ironforge Clinic,” that cold 
synthetic voice announced. “Iron- 
forge Clinic.” 

When the door slid open, he 
scrambled out of the capsule. 
Soundlessly, it glided away. He 
stood on a bright-lit platform. Tens- 
ing with a wary readiness, as if 
waiting for a strange tly to dive, he 
turned to search that long chamber 
for the teeming swarmfolk he had 

17 




been prepared to meet. 

He found nobody anywhere. 

IV 

Bewildered by this silent empti- 
ness where he had expected to en- 
counter teeming billions, he paused 
to sniff the air for any human odor. 
His nose was keen enough to tell 
Sea clan fish-eaters from the 
muskweed pickers of the Wind clan 
or the Game clan nearman hunters, 
but the cool wind that blew from 
the tunnel held nothing of mankind. 

When he listened, all he could 
hear was the thump of his own 
heart and the rustling of his clothing 
and the tiny clink and clatter of his 
hunting gear, all magnified when 
they whispered back from the hard 
white walls. 

As if climbing near a wild tly’s 
nest, he moved along the platform, 
all alert, searching the way for each 
footstep. Still he heard no human 
sound, caught no human scent — till 
a loud gong nearly stopped his 
heart. 

Where it had rung, he found an 
amber sensor circle blinking. Quiv- 
ering with his own strained readi- 
ness, he flashed Goldforge’s ring 
into the circle. It went out. A tall 
crack cut the wall and widened to 
make a doorway. He walked 
through, into a monumental room. 

It should have been busy. Rows 
of seats faced high screens where 
unreadable legends glowed. Bright 
kiosks were spaced here and there 
about an unending desert of floor, 
as if to dispense information or in- 
structions. All around the far-away 
walls, empty archways opened into 
half-seen vacant passages. 

18 



But all his senses found nobody 
anywhere. 

The dead hush dissolved all his 
first elation into dark perplexity. 
Even if the swarmfolk observed 
their own white night, there should 
be somebody somewhere. Though 
he could see no evidence of vio- 
lence or disaster, he began to feel 
that he had stumbled into a universe 
of irrational nightmare. 

A liquid clink took his breath 
again, as startling as some water- 
drop in a desert cave. It rang and 
pattered and died in the long vaults 
above him, and came again before 
he found its source in a new pool of 
scarlet light before him on the floor. 

Uncertainly, he stepped toward it. 

The pool stretched out at once to 
become a bright red line, leading 
toward a distant archway. He 
caught his breath and followed. 

The scarlet mark arrowed ahead, 
guiding him down an echoing hall 
beyond the arch, across another 
huge concourse, into- another cor- 
ridor so long that he could see its 
floor curving disturbingly up and up 
ahead of him to follow its level 
around the axis of the spinning 
sphere. 

Still he met nobody. 

The red line bent at last, to pick 
out a door. A queer light symbol 
flashed beside it. A chime sounded. 
The door divided. A gangling, 
yellow-freckled man ambled out 
into the corridor to greet him in 
fluent street Nggonggan. 

“Welcome, Benefactor! I knew it 
had to be you.” 

“Toolsmith?” Without the blue 
goggles he had always worn on 
Nggongga, with his stiff white hair 



GALAXY 




uncombed and his uneven teeth too 
widely spaced and a faint purple 
stain on his lips, the freckled man 
looked so young and mild and 
harmless that he was hard to recog- 
nize. “I’m glad to find you!” 

“You almost missed me.” 

Relaxed and affable, Toolsmith 
beckoned him through the entry al- 
cove, past the glowing signals of 
what must be the master panel for 
the household machinery, into the 
thin sweet smoke of muskweed 
burning in a black clay censor on an 
antique tripod of Sea clan bronze. 

The room relaxed him. The walls 
were hung with ritual daggers and 
braided rugs of nearman hair. A tall 
shelf held a blown tly’s egg, 
painted with Cru Creetha’s black- 
fan ged grin. The seats were massive 
lancegrass cushions. Inside, every- 
thing was Nggonggan. 

He inhaled the incense gratefully, 
but stiffened again when he saw the 
wide archway in the farther wall. 
Beyond it, bright-sailed boats were 
tacking up a slope of flashing blue 
water, climbing an insane seascape 
that bent up and up to an impossible 
perpendicular and curled back over- 
head, with no horizon. 

For a moment he thought he was 
somehow looking through a window 
into the sphere’s hollow core, 
though he knew he had left it far 
behind. Then Toolsmith touched a 
button and the whole unsettling 
scene dissolved into a _grey fog of 
an empty stereo tank. 

“Your signal from Nggongga 
was just in time to catch me here,” 
Toolsmith was explaining. “It was 
transposed, you see, several days 
ago. Ordinarily, my body would 
have gone straight to salvage, but it

happens that the medics wanted to 
hold it for research into the effects 
of all my years among the 
pathogenic hazards of primitive 
Nggongga. 

“Otherwise — ” 

He broke off to urge Blacklantem 
into the room. 

“Sit!” With a Nggonggan bow 
of ceremonial welcome, he waved 
at the cushions. “Share water and 
shade, shelter and life.” He added 
genially, with his gap-toothed smile, 
‘ ‘I have to admire your sort of reck- 
less enterprise. Snowfire was ex- 
pecting you to follow. I thought you 
would fail to get here, even if you 
tried.” 

“Is she — ’’ He stood looking 
around the room, sniffing the heavy 
smoke-scent, searching for any trace 
of her. “Is she — here?” 

“You’re too late to find her 
alive.’’ Casually compassionate, 
Toolsmith spread his open hands in 
the Nggonggan gesture of final ne- 
gation. “You see, we were both 
transposed together.” 

Once long ago, still proving 
himself for the arena, he had been 
creeping into a dark cave to steal an 
egg from a tly’s nest when he heard 
the furious bellow of the male re- 
turning. Suddenly, now, he could 
taste the bitter dust of the droppings 
again. He felt the same choking 
tightness in his dry throat, heard the 
same fast hammer of his heart. 

But Engineer Toolsmith was no 
bull tly. A tall ungainly man with 
stooped narrow shoulders and 
weak blue eyes, his pale skin still 
bronze-mottled from Nggongga’s 
sun, he looked too mildly insig- 
nificant to be any enemy — so awk- 

20 



wardly unhandsome, in fact, that he 
wondered once more what Snowfire 
had found to love in him. 

“About Snowfire?” Tormented, 
Blacklantem reached out as if to 
clutch his angular frame and shake 
information out of him. “What do 
you mean, when you say she was 
transposed?” 

“Sit and rest, respected Benefac- 
tor.” Toolsmith bowed again in the 
Nggonggan manner, courteous and 
almost apologetic. “I’m afraid 
you’ll be disturbed by what I have 
to tell you, but you’re too late to do 
much about it. The transposition 
process cannot be reversed.” 

He was shuffling about the room 
as he talked, lighting a new 
muskweed stalk in the censer, plac- 
ing a low table between the cush- 
ions, bringing plates of bright- 
skinned fmits and small hard cakes, 
opening a bottle of seaberry wine. 

“I spent half my old life on 
Nggongga,^’ he murmured. “As 
you can see, I became quite a 
primitive. Of course I never took up 
trophy hunting, the way Manager 
Goldforge did. But I did have a 
nice antique collection that we 
brought back, and a small cellar of 
my favorite Nggonggan wines. 
Let’s drink to Snowfire.” 

Blacklantem had firmly resolved 
not to be jealous. Though that 
promised to be difficult, he made 
himself accept a glass of the aroma- 
tic wine. Silently, they sipped. The 
perplexing hush of the whole sphere 
began to echo in his mind. 
Toolsmith’s air of casual ease 
brought his impatience to the burst- 
ing point. 

“Where is she?” he exploded. 
‘ ‘Where ’ s — everybody?’ ’ 



GALAXY 




“Transposed.” Toolsmith shrug- 
ged lazily. “I suppose you came 
expecting to meet millions of us, 
but transposition had been in pro- 
gress for several generations. The 
whole job will take a few more — a 
few of the most conservative 
spheres have hardly begun. Here, 
we’re nearly done, though of course 
I’m not the only live body left. 
You’ll find a good many at the 
transposition center. Even a few 
here at the clinic.” 

“Tell me — ” Struggling with vio- 
lent impulses, he had to be careful 
with his voice. “Won’t you tell me 
what you mean?” 

“You won’t like it.” The weak- 
seeming eyes blinked at him 
thoughtfully. “Yet your status as a 
Benefactor ought to help you grasp 
it. Snowfire had no trouble at all. In 
fact, she was even wishing you 
could share it with us.” 

“She sent me — sent me a 
stereogram.” He felt cold with a 
dread too vague to grasp, and his 
tongue was clumsy with the words. 
“She hinted at something — some 
new process. She called it a cultural 
quantum Jump.” 

“So it is!” Beaming, Toolsmith 
paused to savor his wine. “Our fi- 
nal answer to the problem of num- 
bers. A universal problem. You can 
see the beginning of it if you bother 
to look, even on Nggongga. All 
those refugees from their dried-up 
oases and their wind-eroded fields. 
Jamming themselves into the city to 
beg and breed in the streets.” 
Toolsmith was leaning genially to 
refill his glass. He waved the bottle 
away and sat stiffly upright, waiting 
while the long swarmworlder 
drained his glass and disposed his

angular limbs on the cushions. 

“We’ve always done rather well 
by our own expanding population.” 
Toolsmith smirked smugly through 
his freckles. “I won’t club you with 
statistics, but each one of our 
spheres can hold several times the 
present population of Nggongga, 
still assuring each individual an 
abundance of space and mass and 
energy that even your rulers might 
envy. 

“A dozen generations ago, how- 
ever, we began to feel the limits of 
that physical solution. All the mass 
of our moons and planets had been 
built into vehicles and all the radia- 
tion of our star had been efficiently 
trapped. Of course we tried to limit 
our growth, but our total population 
had become so large that even the 
smallest rate of increase produced 
more people than we could care for. 

“We sought new stars to col- 
onize, but those in reach had all 
been claimed. We did begin efforts 
at expansion to a few such unde- 
veloped worlds as Nggongga, but 
even the most backward races 
turned out to have an irrational at- 
tachment to their plague-ridden 
planets. 

“Now and then some radical 
wanted to relinquish our policy of 
non-contact, suggesting that our ex- 
ported technology would soon con- 
quer all the civilized galaxy, con- 
verting every star into a new 
swarmworld. Such proposals were 
always vetoed. We still respect 
other cultures.” 

Blacklantern had moved impa- 
tiently. 

“Give me time.” With a chiding 
grin, Toolsmith gestured at the pot- 
tery bottle. “You may as well re- 

21 




lax. You’re too late to stop Snow- 
fire’s transposition, and she would 
want you to know all the details be- 
fore you come to your own deci- 
sion.” 

Stubbornly, he shook his head at 
the bottle. 

“As you like.” Toolsmith shrug- 
ged. “But there’s no hurry.” 

If I kill him, he told himself, 
Snowfire will hate me. 

If she’s still alive, he added, to 
hate anybody. 

Grimly, he sat back to listen. 

“We had come to the physical 
limits,” Toolsmith rambled easily 
on. “it looked as if our growth had 
ended, until the computers made a 
breakthrough. Of course our compu- 
ter technology had always been ad- 
vanced, stimulated by all the de- 
mands of our expansion into space. 
For dozens of generations, all our 
culture had been going into the 
memory banks — science and en- 
gineering, laws and commercial rec- 
ords, literature and history, even 
music and art. When our dilemma 
of numbers became acute, the com- 
puter net met the challenge with 
transposition. 

“From the living body, into the 
computer!” 

Toolsmith paused to enjoy his 
shocked response. 

“The entire mental content is 
read out and stored. Memory and 
awareness. Patterns of habit. Emo- 
tions and perceptions. Capacity for 
learning and thinking and growing. 
Everything that makes us human, 
scanned from the fragile and fallible 
cells of the organic brain and trans- 
posed into solid-state matrices in 
eternal crystals. 

“Finally, we’ve shaken off our 



old animal inheritance — all the 
jungle traits that trip up progress on 
planets like Nggongga. We’ve real- 
ly done what the priests and 
philosophers have been calling for 
since mankind left old Earth. We’ve 
broken the chains of the body, to 
set the human spirit free. 

“If you can grasp that — ” 

Toolsmith stopped, blinking at 
him doubtfully. 

“All this means that Snowfire is 
dead?” He sank back against the 
cushions, as numb as if an un- 
milked tly had stung him. “You did 
this — this thing to her?” His hands 
ached for Toolsmith’s scrawny neck 
so savagely he had to clutch them 
together. “You fed her mind into 
some machine? And let her body 
die?” 

Toolsmith was nodding cheerily. 

“I’m the exception. In most 
cases the bodies aren’t revived.” 
His thin shoulders twisted in a ges- 
ture of benign unconcern. “Not that 
they matter. I’ve been speaking to 
Snowfire and my own transposed 
self. They’re both too. busy explor- 
ing their new state of being to have 
much time for me^ but they’re cer- 
tainly very much alive.” 

“I — I won’t believe it!” 
Blacklantem tried to soften his grat- 
ing voice, and he made his quiver- 
ing fists relax. “Snowfire was 
so — so wann, so bright and beauti- 
ful. So altogether human. She can’t 
be herself, caged in some cold 
machine.” 

“I knew you’d find the notion 
hard to take.” Toolsmith made a 
compassionate Nggonggan click. 
“You’re displaying the normal 
primitive prejudice against 
machines, but I hope you’ll try to 



22 



GALAXY 




rise above it. If you’ll stop to think, 
you’ll have to admit that human 
brain tissue is just about the worst 
possible vehicle for intelligence.” 

He grunted his angry disbelief. 

‘‘Compare the two!” Toolsmith 
urged him blandly. ‘‘The organic 
brain functions through clumsy 
electro-chemical processes propa- 
gated at a few hundred feet per 
second. The computer functions at 
the speed of light. At best, the hu- 
man brain is a transient association 
of unlikely atoms, designed by ran- 
dom evolutionary mutations. Our 
great computer net is the ultimate 
mental instrument, formed by intel- 
ligence for the functions of intelli- 
gence.” 

Toolsmith’s pale eyes shone, and 
a sudden fervor lifted his twangy 
Nggonggan nasals. 

‘‘Transposition sharpens all your 
sensations and amplifies your emo- 
tions. It lifts all experience to a new 
level of intensity— ^nowfire -and my 
new self assure me that making love 
is now an ecstacy they had never 
hoped to discover.” 

Blacklantem tried not to flinch. 

‘‘The change has made them 
truly immortal,” Toolsmith ran 
happily on. ‘‘They’re secure now 
from sickness and exhaustion, from 
all pain and decay. Their mental 
powers are multiplied beyond our 
comprehension. Their memories are 
absolute. They can make full and 
instant contact with all the other 
minds in the machine — or even 
merge with them. They have 
reached a perfect state of being. 
One that you primitives never im- 
agined, even for your greatest 
gods!” 

Blacklantem sat staring, feeling

cold and dull and ill. 

‘‘Drink up and cheer up!” 
Toolsmith drained the bottle into 
their glasses, splashing recklessly. 
‘‘You haven’t glimpsed the real 
beauty of it yet. I’m an engineer. I 
respect practical efficiency more 
than anything, and transposition is 
superlatively efficient. As a vehicle 
for life, our computer net is twelve 
point two million times better than 
our old organic bodies.” 

He flourished his dripping glass. 
‘‘Evaluate that! Twelve-point-two 
million human minds — complete, 
human beings — fully supported with 
the same space and mass and 
energy we had been wasting to 
maintain only one. That’s the 
reason you met so few people on 
your way here. Most of us — in this 
sphere, anyhow — have already been 
transposed. We have resources now 
to supply twelve million times our 
former population.” 

Adam’s apple bobbing beneath 

23 





the yellow freckles, he gulped his 
wine. 

“I suppose you’re busy project- 
ing our future population curves. 
The problem gets complex, because 
nobody ever dies. You’ll be glad to 
know that birth still takes place in- 
side the computer — with none of the 
old physical hazards, and with vast- 
ly enhanced opportunities for intel- 
ligent selection and manipulation 
and recombination of the parental 
genetic factors. Without such 
growth, our whole world would die. 
Now, however, the rate of growth 
can be rationally controlled — as it 
seldom has been on the primitive 
worlds.” 

‘‘I’m not projecting anything.” 
Blacklantern tried to moderate his 
voice. ‘‘But tell me this. If trans- 
position is everything you say, why 
didn’t you let Snowfire take the se- 
cret back to the Benefactors? Don’t 
other worlds need it?” 

‘‘Our position makes good 
sense.” Toolsmith met his harsh 
impatience with an air of mild re- 
proof. ‘‘We don’t export our 
culture — simply because it is 
superior. In contact situations, the 
other race nearly always accepts it 
and lets their own culture die.” 

Blacklantern has surged half up- 
right, and Toolsmith beckoned him 
back toward his cushions. 

‘‘Cultures are living entities, with 
their own rights to survive. When 
they are closely kin, they sometimes 
merge successfully. I can see a 
legitimate role for you Benefactors, 
in facilitating such mergers. But we 
have pulled too far ahead. Contact 
with your world would surely kill 
Nggonggan culture — even though 
dislocated individuals might sur- 

24 



vive. We don’t want that.” 

Hastily, he raised both hands 
against Blacklantem’s anger. 

‘‘Share peace! We mean well, be- 
lieve me, and the wisdom of our 
position has been established many 
times. Cultures grow. When you 
Nggonggans are ready for a new 
technology, you’ll find it for your- 
selves.” 

‘‘You’re wrong!” Blacklantern 
rasped. ‘‘Cultures have always 
spread from people to people. The 
impact of new ways may be 
painful — but progress always is. 
Our business as Benefactors is to 
ease the pain.” 

Toolsmith shrugged, his contempt 
not entirely veiled. 

‘‘About Snowfire — ” Blacklan- 
tem stopped to smooth his tone and 
he spread both hands in the Game 
clan gesture that begged for hospi- 
tality. ‘‘Can I speak to her? Where- 
ever she is!” 

‘‘If she likes.” Toolsmith waved 
a limp freckled hand at the stereo 
tank. ‘‘You’ll have to remember 
that transposition has enlarged her 
whole scale of being. I' really doubt 
that you matter to her now. But you 
can try.” 

Lazily, he rose. 

‘‘With all respects. Benefactor.” 
He stood dipping his white-stubbled 
head in a Nggonggan bow of part- 
ing. ‘‘You’ve had a pretty full brief- 
ing, and now the medics want me at 
the lab. Their gross observations are 
completed. I’m reporting now for 
the histological studies, so I don’t 
expect to be back.” 

‘‘You mean — ” Shock caught 
Blacklantem’s voice. ‘‘You expect 
to die?” 

‘‘The medics will be using up my 

GALAXY 




body.” He nodded casually. ‘‘It’s 
good for nothing else. But the real 
me, programmed into the machine, 
is more alive than ever. I’ll never 
die.” 

‘‘Once in the arena I heard a dis- 
ciple of Cru Creetha make the same 
boast. An hour later he was stung 
and begging for the dagger.” 

‘‘People don’t return from Cru 
Creetha’s mythical kingdom.” 
Toolsmith murmured. ‘‘But if you’ll 
wait here, I think Snowfire will 
come back to you.” His white head 
bobbed again. ‘‘Share drink, share 
food, share peace.” 

“TIeesh,” Blacklantem answered 
stiffly. “Share life.” 

He was busy for a moment at the 
control panel in the entry. Blacklan- 
tern heard him humming an old 
Sand clan love song. Then the door 
whispered, and he was gone.

LjEFT alone to wait for Snowfire 
in that tiny odd oasis of Nggonggan 
culture. Blacklantem felt lifted with 
the same curious lightness and 
keenness that had filled him before 
his first tly fight. The smoke from 
the muskweed censer became unen- 
durably sharp and sweet. The after- 
taste of the wine turned acid in his 
mouth. The breathless stillness 
seemed to promise some intolerable 
explosion. Each beat of his heart 
opened another anxious infinity. 

The faint click of the stereo tank 
seemed louder than a mangun. He 
had to squint and blink against the 
sudden glare that burst through its 
fog. Before any form took shape, 
he heard Snowfire’s eager low- 
pitched voice: “Blackie! I’m so 
glad you came.”

While she spoke, the burst and 
swirl of fire in the tank had become 
another Nggonggan room, with orn- 
amental daggers and patterned 
carpets on the walls and muskweed 
stalks charring in a black clay 
censer on a bronze tripod. Almost 
exactly, it mirrored the room where 
he was — but the person reflected 
where he stood was Snowfire. 

He ran to meet her, rejoicing in 
her warm golden loveliness. She 
wore something snug and lustrous 
that flowed to the floor but bared 
one firm pale-gold breast. Her 
green-gold eyes smiled into his, 
dazzling with delight. 

“Watch the glass!” 

In his hot desire to take her in his 
arms, he had almost forgotten the 
wall of the tank. She raised her 
hand to stop him and laughed at the 
way he checked himself, a glint of 
malice in her eyes. 

“Vou can’t just walk into the 
computer,” she said. “I’ll have to 
send a car to bring you to the trans- 
position center. 

A few minutes — if you can 
wait!” 

He recoiled, amost as if she had 
slapped him. 

“You’re really — dead?” he 
whispered. “Except — ” 

“I suppose.” Her carefree shrug 
sent waves of fire through her red- 
golden hair. “The bodies aren’t re- 
vived. They go straight to the mass 
exchangers.” 

“You can’t — ” His aching throat 
caught again. “You can’t come 
back?” 

“Why should anyone go back?” 
Her long body shivered in the tight 
scarlet sheath, and her eyes grew 
dark with something close to terror. 

26 



“I remember life as it used to 
be — when I knew no better. I 
thought it was good, as you still do. 
But now I could never endure all its 
agonies again. The limits of the or- 
ganic body. The frustration and 
weakness and pain. The dread of 
inevitable death. Worst of all, the 
loneliness.” 

Her long golden arms opened to- 
ward him. 

“I loved you, Blackie. I believe 
you loved me. But we were both 
terribly alone — shut up in the pris- 
ons of our organic bodies as all 
mortal humanity is. I could never 
really understand you — never really 
reach you. We always had a barrier 
between us.” 

She gestured impatiently, as if to 
brush the wall of the tank aside. 

“Out here, we communicate. The 
old barriers are gone. Contact is 
closer than speech or touch. You’re 
part of everybody else, as fully as 
you wish to be. All that anyone has 
ever learned or lived is yours to 
remember — to be — with no loss of 
the individual you . ” . 

She made a wry little grimace 
that twisted a dagger in his own re- 
collection. 

“Words aren’t good enough. 
They never were. Nothing was — not 
even the love we had in the desert, 
with the Game clan hunters behind 
us.” She paused to smile at him 
dreamily, eves half closed, lips a 
little parted, arms slowly lifting to 
her red-golden hair. “You’ll know 
what I mean,” she breathed, “when 
you’re transposed. When we love, 
we’ll truly share each other. I’ll feel 
all you feel, and you’ll feel all I 
feel. We’ll be entirely one.” 

Thinking of Toolsmith, he fe}t 

GALAXY 




weak and cold. 

“Here outside, all of us share ev- 
erything.” She reached again as if 
to grasp his hand. ‘‘A quantum 
jump in human evolution!” Her 
breathless huskiness begged him to 
understand. ‘‘In all the history of 
the universe, the only important fact 
has been the slow expansion of 
awareness, from a tiny spark in the 
first one-celled things to each stage 
of brighter light as some new power 
of mind emerged. If you look for 
the quantum jumps, they have all 
been inventions in communi- 
cation — nerve tissue, sense organs, 
language, writing, electronics, the 
space gates. 

‘‘Now, transposition!” 

She was leaning closer to the bar- 
rier, so ripe and warm and wonder- 
ful that he quivered with desire. 

‘‘Those inventions have always 
fused minds together, into greater 
and greater social beings. Into 
many-celled individuals. Into 
families. Into tribes. Into nations. 
Into the whole galactic civilization. 
Each stage enjoyed wider percep- 
tions, a vaster experience, a higher 
level of awareness. Now, through 
our computer net, uncountable 
merged minds have reached a new 
era of conscious evolution. We’ve 
become a supermind!” 

The light in her green eyes 
frightened him. 

‘‘The final limits of our new 
power are not yet tested — if any 
limits do exist — but we can already 
control mass and energy and space 
and time as no lone human brain 
could ever hope to. We can already 
sense older and greater superminds 
in the farther arms of the galaxy, 
and we’re reaching out for contact 

THE ETERNITY ENGINE 



with them. We can already foresee 
even more exciting quantum jumps 
on our way, toward a full conquest 
of all the brute stuff of the whole 
universe by a completely conscious 
mind. A fully sentient cosmos! 

‘‘Blackie, aren’t you thrilled?” 

Both hands now pressed hard 
against the cold crystal wall bet- 
ween them, he stood frozen, dazed 
with a shapeless dread, gripped in 
spite of himself by her triumphant 
emotion yet stunned by the stark 
immensity of her vision. 

‘‘Blackie, haven’t you been trou- 
bled by the nature of things?” Her 
voice fell appealingly, as if she had 
suddenly sensed his whirling uncer- 
tainty. ‘‘By the deadness of all the 
cold mass around us? By all the 
stubborn facts that feelings can’t 
change? By the terrible gap between 
what we are and what we want?’ ’ 

When she paused, he had to nod. 

‘‘The world has always been a 
poor fit for us.” Her urgency was 
almost plaintive. ‘‘Most science and 
most art and religion has been a 
pathetic effort to improve that fit — 
to discover or invent some sort of 
order or meaning in the shape of na- 
ture. Now we’ve found the natural 
plan.” 

Elation quickened the rythm of 
her voiee. 

‘‘Now at last, we belong! We’re 
all part of an increasing natural or- 
der that will expand without limit 
until it has transformed the whole 
space-time universe into the mental 
instrument of a single ultimate 
awareness — ” 

A gong boomed. 

‘‘Your car.” Her bright head 
moved toward the doorway behind 
him. ‘‘Waiting to take you to the 

27 




transposition center.” Her voice 
sank huskily again, almost caress- 
ingly. ‘‘You needn’t hesitate. The 
process has been perfected for sev- 
eral generations, and tested many 
trillion times. There’s no risk. No 
pain at all. The scanner itself puts 
you to sleep, and your body will 
never be revived.” 

Her full lips pouted as if to kiss 
him. ‘‘In an hour, you’ll be with 
me.” 

The gong throbbed again. 

He drew back from her, trem- 
bling. 

‘‘Listen to me, Blackie!” Her 
voice was flat and shallow now, 
alarmed. “If you’re still doubtful, I 
can understand. I was a Benefactor, 
too, you know. The old way of 
thinking was hard to shake off. 
When Engineer Toolsmith first told 
me about transposition, I begged for 
permission to take the invention — or 
even just the news about it — back to 
the fellowship. He said it wasn’t 
possible. I appealed to the transposi- 
tion staff, on the grounds that isola- 
tion law didn’t apply to me because 
I wasn’t a swarmworld citizen. 
Once I thought I was about to win, 
but they kept delaying the decision 
till Toolsmith persuaded me to 
come through with him. Now I 
wouldn’t go back — not for any- 
thing!” 

Her pleading voice sank 
breathlessly. 

“Trust me, Blackie!” 

“I — ” A throb of pain closed his 
throat. “I guess I’m still a Benefac- 
tor. I thank you for reminding me 
of that.” 

“Blackie!” She cried his name 
sharply. “I was so happy when 
Toolsmith said you were here to 

28 



join us. You can’t — ” He saw her 
bright tears welling. “You can’t 
turn back!” 

Her golden arms had opened for 
him. He swayed toward her till his 
head struck the crystal wall. In an 
agony of frustration, he drove his 
fist against it. 

The impact dimmed her image 
and set diamond sparks to dancing 
all around her. 

“Don’t!” Her image cleared 
again, her eyes black with pain. 
“You could smash the glass. You 
could bleed. You could die, Blackie. 
Die!” Dread hushed her voice. 
“You could miss immortality — all 
your splendid chance to share the 
transformation of the universe. 

“If you love me — ” 

A third time, the gong boomed. 
“Come, Blackie!” she breathed. 
“Come now. The car can’t wait.” 
“I— I can’t!” 

“Why, Blackie? Why?” 

“Maybe — maybe I’m too primi- 
tive.” Stiffly, with both hands, he 
pushed himself away from the tank. 
“I do love you, Snowfire — at least 
I loved the human you. But I’m not 
quite ready to become a god. I’m 
going home to be a Benefactor.” 
“You’re refusing transposition?” 
Her wet eyes widened. “The 
greatest gift there is! I don’t under- 
stand you, Blackie. I never could.” 
“You’ve become a goddess. I’m 
still a black Nggonggan.” 

“Knowing about transposition — ” 
Her hurt eyes searched him 
again. “How can you be just a 
Benefactor?” 

“I think I see my mission now,” 
he told her. “I’m going to take the 
news back, as you wanted to — if I 
can get back. I can’t take the actual 

GALAXY 




process. Maybe Nggongga isn’t 
ready for it. But I think my troubled 
people need new beliefs to replace 
the old myths that progress and 
knowledge have killed. Perhaps the 
legend of eternal life in the compu- 
ter can replace the old legend of 
Cru Creetha.” 

She shook her head, bewildered. 

“I offer godhood.” Her eyes 
were blankly accusing. “You want 
only a legend. I hope you’re never 
sorry — ’ ’ 

Her head turned as if to listen. 

“Good-by, Blackie!’’ Briefly, 
sadly, she glanced back at him. 
“Freckles is calling me now.” 

The projected room around her 
dimmed and faded. The Nggonggan 
daggers and rugs and censer were 
gone. Where they had been, he saw 
the fleeting image of a bare black 
granite peak. Toolsmith stood there 
with his angular arm flung out to- 
ward a huge red sun rising from a 
flat black ocean. 

When Snowfire appeared there, 
he turned to welcome her with his 
gaptoothed, grin, and she was 
scrambling to his side as they van- 
ished. 

Blacklantern stood a long time 
gazing into the empty stereo tank. 

“Freckles!” The sound grated 
harshly in his throat. “Freckles!” 

He swung abruptly from the tank 
to stalk the empty room, all his new 
resolution crumbling into pain and 
doubt. Even though he had refused 
Snowfire’s gift of something like 
divinity, her golden image still 
haunted him. Not eternal, he was 
not yet ready to die. He had rashly 
spoken of returning to Nggongga, 
but he knew no way to get there. 



He felt utterly lost, in a world he 
would never know. 

That rnellow gong throbbed 
again. 

Uncertain what it could mean, he 
started toward the entry. 

“Blackie!” 

The doorway was open, and 
another Snowfire stood there, 
quietly smiling. He stared, recoiled, 
gasped for breath, and swept her 
into his arms. Her golden flesh felt 
warm and firm and real. Her red- 
glinting hair was fragrant with her 
own clean sweetleaf scent, and he 
found no barrier between them. 

“You look — terrible!” She 
caught his arms and pushed him off 
to study him. “Was my other self 
so frightful?” 

“I thought you were dead.” 

“That was my transposed self.” 
She nodded at the gray-fogged tank. 
“But I’m the original me.” 

Her green eyes smiled at his mute 
astonishment. 

“I. hadn’t really expected to be 
revived, but I had applied for per- 
mission to return to Nggongga and 
the transposition staff has finally 
agreed that we’re not under their 
legitimate jurisdiction. They’re 
opening the gates to return us to 
Nggongga. The car’s waiting. 

“Shall we go?” 

He glanced back into the stereo 
tank, where her superhuman self 
had offered him everlasting life. Its 
cloudy depths looked cold and 
dead. He waggled three black fin- 
gers at it, in a childhood gesture 
against Cru Creetha, and swung ea- 
gerly back to grasp her mortal hand. 

They ran together to the waiting 
car. ★

ELEPHANT WITH 
WOODEN LEG 

JOHN SLADEK 






Note: Madmen are often unable to 
distinguish between dream, reality, 
and. .between dream and reality. 
None of the incidents in Henry 
Lafarge’s narrative ever happened 
or could have happened. His 
“Orinoco Institute’’ bears no rela- 
tion to the actual think tank of that 
name, his “Drew Blenheim’’ in no 
way resembles the famous 
futurologist, and his “United States 
of America’’ is not even a burlesque 
upon the real United States of Ar- 
morica. 

I couldn’t hear him. 

“Can’t hear you, Blenheim. The 
line must be bad.’’ 

“Or mad, Hank. I wonder what 
that would take?’’ 

“What what?” 

“What it would take to drive a 
telephone system out of its mind, 
eh? So that it wasn’t just giving 
wrong numbers, but madly right 
ones. Let’s see: Content-addressable 
computer memories to shift the 
conversations. .” 

I stopped listening. A bug was 
crawling up the window frame 
across the room. It moved like a 
cockroach, but I couldn’t be sure. 

“Look, Blenheim, I’m pretty 
busy today. Is there something on 
your mind?’ ’ 

He plowed right on. “. so if 
you’re trying to reserve a seat on 
the plane to Seville, you’d get a 
seat at the opera instead. While the 
person who wants the opera seat is 
really making an appointment with 



a barber, whose customer is just 
then talking to the box-office for 
Hair, or maybe making a hairline 
reservation. .” 

“Blenheim, I’m talking to you.” 
“Yes?” 

“What was it you called me up 
about?” 

“Oh, this and that. I was won- 
dering, for instance, whether parrots 
have internal clocks.” 

“What?” I still couldn’t be sure 
the bug was a cockroach, but I sa- 
luted just in case. 

“If so, maybe we could get them 
to act as speaking clocks.” 

He sounded crazier than ever. 
What trivial projects for one of the 
best brains of our century — no 
wonder he was on leave. 

“Blenheim, I’m busy. Institute 
work must go on, you know.” 

“Yes. Tell you what, why don’t 
you drop over this afternoon? I have 
something to talk over with you.” 
“Can’t. I have a meeting all af- 
ternoon.” 

“Fine, fine. See you, then. Any- 
time around 4:43 . ’ ’ 

Madmen never listen. 



Oelmut rassmussen came in just 
as Blenheim hung up on me. He 
seemed distressed. Not that his face 
showed it; ever since that bomb 
wrecked his office, Hel has been 
unable to move his face. Hysterical 
paralysis. Dr. Grobe had explained. 

But Hel could signal whatever he 
felt by fiddling with the stuff in his 



31 




shirt pocket. For anger, his red pen- 
cil came out (and sometimes un- 
derwent a savage sharpening), im- 
patience made him work his slide 
rule, surprise made him glance into 
his pocket diary, and so on. 

Just now he was clicking the but- 
ton on his ballpoint pen with some 
agitation. For a moment he seemed 
about to actually take it out and 
draw worry lines on his forehead. 

“What is it, Hel? The costing on 
Project Faith?” He spread the 
schedules on my desk and pointed 
to the snag: a discrepancy between 
the estimated cost of blasting apart 
and hauling away the Rocky Moun- 
tains, and the value of oil recovered 
in the process. 

“1 see. The trains, eh? Diesels 
seem to use most of the oil we get. 
How about steam locomotives, 
then?” 

He clapped me on the shoulder 
and nodded. 

“By the way, Hel, I won’t be at 
the meeting today. Blenheim just 
called up. Wants to see me.” 

Hel indicated surprise. 

“Look, I know he’s a crackpot. 
You don’t have to pocket-diary me, 
I know he’s nuts. But he’s also 
technically still the Director. Our 
boss. They haven’t taken him off 
the payroll, just put him on sick 
leave. Besides, he used to have a 
lot of good ideas.” 

Hel took out a felt-tip pen and 
began to doodle with some sarcasm. 
The fact was, Blenheim had com- 
pletely lost his grip during his last 

32 



year at the Institute. Before the 
government forced him to take 
leave, he’d been spending half a 
million a year in developing, 
rumors said, glass pancakes. And 
who could forget his plan to arm 
the police with chocolate revolvers? 

“Sure, he’s had a bad time, but 
he’s better now,” 1 said without 
conviction. 

Institute people never get better, 
Hel seemed to retort. They just 
keep on making bigger and better 
decisions, with more and more bril- 
liance and finality, until they break. 
Like glass pancakes giving out an 
ever purer ring, they explode. 

It was true. Like everyone else 
here, I was seeing Dr Grobe, our 
resident psychiatrist, several times a 
week. Then there were cases 
beyond even the skill of Dr Grobe: 
Joe Feeney, who interrupted his 
work (on the uses of holograms) 
one day to announce that he was a 
file cabinet. Edna Bessler, who be- 
lieved that she was being pursued 
by a synthetic a priori proposition. 
The lovely entomologist Pawlie Sut- 
ton, who just disappeared. And 
George Hoad, whose rocket re- 
search terminated when he walked 
into the Gents one day and cut his 
throat. George spent the last few 
minutes of consciousness vainly try- 
ing to mop up the bloody floor with 
toilet paper. 

Something was wrong with the 
personnel around this place, all 
right. And I suspected that our little 
six-legged masters knew more about 



GALAXY 




this than they were saying. 

Finally I mumbled, “I know it’s 
useless, Hel. But I’d better find out 
what he wants.” 

You do what you think is best, 
Hel thought. He stalked out of my 
office, then, examining the point on 
his red pencil. 

The bug was a cockroach, 
P.americana. It sauntered across the 
wall until it reached the curly edge 
of a wall poster, then it flew about 
a foot to land on the nearest dark 
spot. This was Uncle Sam’s right 
eye. Uncle Sam, with his accusing 
eyes and finger, was trying to re- 
cruit men for the Senate and House 
of Representatives. On this poster, 
he said, “The Senate Needs men”. 
So far, the recruiting campaign was 
a failure. Who could blame people 
for not wanting to go on the “firing 
line” in Washington? The casualty 
rate of Congressmen was thirty per 
cent annually, and climbing, in 
spite of every security measure we 
could think of. 

Which reminded me of work. I 
scrubbed off the blackboard and 
started laying out a contingency tree 
for Project Pogo, a plan to make the 
whole cabinet — all 143 secre- 
taries — completely mobile, hence, 
proof against revolution. So far 
the Security Secretary didn’t 
care for the idea of “taking to our 
heels”, but it was cheaper to keep 
the cabinet on the move than to 
guard them in Washington. 



The cockroach, observing my in- 
dustry, left by a wall ventilator, and 
I breathed easier. The contingency 
tree didn’t look so interesting by 
now, and out the window I could 
see real trees. 

The lawn rolled away down from 
the building to the river (not the 
Orinoco, despite our name). The far 
bank was blue-black with pines, and 
the three red maples on our lawn, 
this time of year, stood out like 
three separate, brilliant fireballs. 
For just the duration of a bluejay’s 
flight from one to another, I could 
forget about the stale routine, the 
smell of chalkdust. 

I remembered a silly day three 
years ago, when I’d carved a heart 
on one of those trees, with Pawlie 
Sutton’s initials and my own. 

Now a security guard strolled his 
puma into view. They stopped un- 
der the nearest maple and he snap- 
ped the animal’s lead. It was up the 
trunk in two bounds, and out of 
sight among the leaves. While that 
stupid-faced man in uniform looked 
up, the fireball shook and swayed 
above him. A few great leaves fell, 
bright as drops of blood. 

Now what was this headache go- 
ing to be about? 

All the big problems were 
solved, or at least we knew how to 
solve them. The world was just about 
the way we wanted it, now, ex- 
cept we no longer seemed to want it 
just that way. That’s how Mr How- 



ELEPHANT WITH WOODEN LEG 



33 




ell, the Secretary of Personal Rela- 
tionships, had put it in his telecast. 
What was missing? God, I think he 
said. God had made it possible for 
us to dam the Amazon and move 
the Orinoco, to feed India and dig 
gold from the ocean floor and cure 
cancer. And now God — the way 
Howell said it made you feel that 
He, too was in the Cabinet — God 
was going to help us get down and 
solve our personal, human prob- 
lems. Man’s inhumanity to man. 
The lack of communication. The 
hatred. God and Secretary Howell 
were going to get right down to 
some committee work on this. I 
think that was the telecast where 
Howell announced the introduction 
of detention camps for “malcon- 
tents”. Just until we got all of our 
personal problems ironed out. I had 
drawn up plans for these camps that 
summer. Then George Hoad bor- 
rowed my pocket knife one day and 
never gave it back. Then the 
headaches started. 

As I stepped outside, the stupid- 
faced guard was looking up the skirt 
of another tree. 

“Prrt., prrt” he said quietly, and 
the black puma dropped to earth be- 
side him. There was something 
hanging out of its mouth that looked 
like a bluejay’s wing. 

“Good girl. Good girl.” 

I hurried away to the helicopter. 

Drew Blenheim’s tumbledown 
mansion sits in the middle of a 

34 



withered woods. For half a mile 
around, the trees are laced together 
with high-voltage fence. Visitors 
are blindfolded and brought in by 
helicopter. There are also rumors of 
minefields and other security mea- 
sures. At that time, I put it all down 
to Blenheim’s paranoia. 

The engine shut down with the 
sound of a coin spinning to rest. 
Hands helped me out and removed 
my blindfold. The first thing I saw, 
hanging on a nearby stretch of 
fence, was a lump of bones and 
burnt fur from some small animal. 
The guards and their submachine- 
guns escorted me only as far as the 
door, for Blenheim evidently hated 
seeing signs of the security he 
craved. The house looked dismal 
and decayed — the skull of some fu- 
ture Orinoco Institute? 

A servant wearing burnt cork 
makeup and white gloves ushered 
me through a dim. hallway that 
smelled of hay and on into the 
library. 

“I’ll tell Mr Blenheim you’re 
here, sir. Perhaps you’d care to read 
one of his monographs while you 
wait?” 

I flicked through The Garden of 
Regularity (a slight tract recom- 
mending that older people preserve 
intestinal health by devouring their 
own dentures) and opened an in- 
sanely boring book called Can Bac- 
teria Read? I was staring uncom- 
prehendingly af one of its pages 
when a voice said: 

“Are you still here?” The plump 

GALAXY 




old woman had evidently been sit- 
ting in her deep chair when I came 
in. As she craned around at me, I 
saw she had a black eye. Something 
was wrong with her hair, too. “I 
thought you’d left by now — oh, it’s 
you.” 

“Madame, do I know you?’’ 

She sat forward and put her face 
to the light. The black eye was tat- 
tooed, and the marcelled hair was 
really a cap of paper, covered with 
wavy ink lines. But it was Edna 
Bessler, terribly aged. 

“You’ve changed, Edna.’’ 

“So would you, young man, if 
you’d been chased around a 
nuthouse for two years by a synthe- 
tic a priori proposition.’’ She 
sniffed. “Well, thank heavens the 
revolution is set for tomorrow.’’ 

I laughed nervously. “Well, Ed- 
na, it certainly is good to see you. 
What are you doing here, any- 
way?’’ 

“There are quite a few of the old 
gang here: Joe Feeney and — and 
others. This place has become a 
kind of repair depot for mad 
futurologists. 

Blenheim is very kind, but of 
course he’s quite mad himself. Mad 
as a wet hen. As you see from his 
writing.’’ 

‘‘Can Bacteria Read? I couldn’t 
read it.’’ 

“Oh, he thinks that germs are, 
like people, amenable to suggestion. 
So, with the proper application of 
mass hypnosis among the microbe 
populations, we ought to be able to 



cure any illness with any quack 
remedy.” 

I nodded. “Hope he recovers 
soon. I’d like to see him back at the 
Institute, working on real projects 
again. Big stuff, like the old days. 
I’ll never forget Drew Blenheim, 
the man who invented satellite dial- 
ing.” 

Satellite dialing came about 
when the malcontents were trying to 
jam government communications 
systems, cut lines and blow up ex- 
change offices. Blenheim’s system 
virtually made each telephone a 
complete exchange in itself, dialling 
directly through a satellite. Voice 
signals were compressed and burped 
skywards in short bursts that evaded 
most jamming signals. It was an 
Orinoco Institute triumph over anar- 
chy. 

Edna chuckled. “Oh, he’s work- 
ing on real projects again. I said he 
was mad, not useless. Now if you’ll 
help me out of this chair, I must go 
fix an elephant.” 

I was sure I’d misheard this last. 
After she’d gone, I looked over a 
curious apparatus in the corner. 
Parts of it were recognizeable — a 
clock inside a parrot cage, a gas 
laser, and a fringed shawl sus- 
pended like a flag from a walking- 
stick thrust into a watermelon — but 
their combination was baffling. 

At 4:43 by the clock in the cage, 
the blackface servwt took me to a 
gloomy great hall place, scattered 
with the shapes of easy chairs and 
sofas.

A figure in a diving suit rose 
from the piano and waved me to a 
chair. Then it sat down again, flip- 
ping out its airhoses behind the 
bench. 

For a few minutes I suffered 
liiiougli a fumbling version of some 
Mexican tune. But when 
lilenhcim — no doubt it was he — 
stood up and started juggling 
orangc.s, 1 felt it was time to speak 
tnit. 

“Look, I’ve interrupted my work 
to come here. Is this all you have to 
■how me?’’ 

One of the oranges vaulted high, 
nut of sight in the gloom above; 
.inothcr hit me in the chest. The fi- 
gure opened its faceplate and grin- 
ned. “Long time no see. Hank.” 

It was me. 

1\UBBER MASK, Blenheim 
explained, plucking at it. “I 
couldn’t resist trying it on you, life 
gets so tedious here. Ring for Ras- 
tus, will you? I want to shed this 
suit.” 

We made small talk while the 
servant helped him out of the heavy 
diving suit. Rather, Blenheim rat- 
tled on alone; I wasn’t feeling well 
at all. The shock of seeing myself 
had reminded me of something I 
should remember, but couldn’t. 

. .to build a heraldry vending 
machine. Put in a coin, punch out 
your name, and it prints a coat-of- 
arms. Should suit those malcon- 
tents, eh? All they probably really 
want is a coat-of-arms.” 



“They’re just plain evil,” I said. 

‘ ‘When I think of how they bombed 
poor Hel Rassmussen s office — ” 
“Oh, he did that himself. Didn’t 
you know?” 

“A suicide attempt? So that ex- 
plains the hysterical paralysis!” 

My face looked exasperated, as 
Blenheim peeled it off. “Is that 
what Dr Grobe told you? Paralyzed, 
hell, the blast blew his face clean 
off. Poor Hel’s present face is a 
solid plate of plastic, bolted on. He 
breathes through a hole in his 
shoulder and feeds himself at the 
armpit. If Grobe told you any dif- 
ferent, he’s just working on your 
morale.” 

From upstairs came a kind of 
machine-gun clatter. The minstrel 
servant glided in with a tray of 
drinks. 

“Oh, Rastus. Tell the, twins not 
to practice their tap-dancing just 
now, will you? Hank looks as if he 
has a headache.” 

“Yes, sir. By the way, the 
three-legged elephant has arrived. I 
put it in the front hall. I’m afraid 
the prosthesis doesn’t fit.” 

“I’ll fix it. Just ask Jumbo to 
lean up against the wall for half an 
hour.” 

“Very good, sir.” 

After this, I decided to make my 
escape from this Bedlam. 

“Doesn’t anybody around here 
ever do anything straightforward or 
say anything in plain English?” 
“We’re trying to tell you some- 
thing, Hank, but it isn’t easy. For 



36 



GALAXY 




one thing, I’m not sure we can trust 
you.” 

“Trust me for what?” 

His twisted face twisted out a 
smile. “If you don’t know, then 
how can we trust you? But come 
with me to the conservatory and I’ll 
show you something.” 

We went to a large room with 
dirty glass walls. To me it looked 
like nothing so much as a bombed- 
out workshop. Though there were 
bags of fertilizer oh the floor, there 
wasn’t a living plant in sight. 

Instead, the tables were littered 
with machinery and lab equipment: 
jumbles of retorts and colored wires 
and nuts and bolts that made no 
sense. 

“What do you see. Hank?” 
“Madness and chaos. You might 
as well have pears in the light sock- 
ets and a banana on the telephone 
cradle, for all I can make of it.” 

He laughed. “That’s better. 
We’ll crazily you yet.” 

I pointed to a poster-covered cyl- 
inder standing in the comer. One 
of the posters had Uncle Sam, say- 
ing: “I Need men for Congress”. 

“What’s that Parisian adverti- 
sing-kiosk doing here?” 

“Rastus built that for us, out of 
scrap alloys I had lying around. 
Like it?” 

I shrugged. “The top’s too 
pointed. It looks like — ” 

“Yes, go on.” 

“This is silly. All of you need a 
few sessions with Dr Grobe,” I 
said. “I’m leaving.” 



“I was afraid you’d say that. 
Hank. But it’s you who needs 
another session with Dr Grobe.” 

“You think 7’m crazy?” 

“No, you’re too damned sane.” 

“From your viewpoint, yes!” I 
shouted. “Why bother with all that 
security outside? Afraid someone 
will steal the idea of a minstrel 
show or the secret of a kiosk?” 

He laughed again. “Hank, those 
guards aren’t to keep strangers out. 
They’re to keep us in. You see, my 
house really and truly is a 
madhouse.” 

1 stamped out a side door and or- 
dered my helicopter. 

“My head’s killing me,” I told 
the guard. “Take it easy with that 
blindfold.” 

“Oh, sorry, mac. Hey, look, it’s 
none of my business, but what did 
you do with that tree you brung 
with you?” 

“Tree?” God, even the guards 
were catching it. 

T'hat evening I went to see Dr 
Grobe. 

“Another patient? I swear. I’m 
going to install a revolving door on 
this office. Sit down, Uh, Hank 
LaFarge, isn’t it? Sit down. Hank. 
Let’s see. .oh, you’re the guy 
who’s afraid of cockroaches, 
right?” 

“Not exactly afraid of them. In 
fact they remind me of someone I 
used to be fond of. Pawlie Sutton 
used to work with them. But my 



ELEPHANT WITH WOODEN LEG 



37 




problem is, I know that cockroaches 
are the real bosses. We’re just kid- 
ding ourselves with our puppet gov- 
ernment, our Uncle Sham — ” 

He chuckled appreciatively. 

“But what ‘bugs’ me, doctor, is 
that nobody will recognize this plain 
and simple truth.’’ 

“Ah-ah. Remember, last time 
you agreed to call me by my first 
name. Hank.’’ 

“Sorry. Sorry, uh, Oddpork.’’ I 
couldn’t imagine anyone with that 
first name wanting to be called by 
it, unless he wanted to get used to it 
himself. He was an odd-pork of a 
man, too; plump and rumpy, with 
over-large hands that never stopped 
adjusting his already well-adjusted 
clothes. He always looked surprised 
at everything I said, even “hello.” 
Every session, he made the same 
joke about the revolving door. 

Still, repetitive jokes help build 
up a family atmosphere, which was 
probably what he wanted. There 
was a certain comfort in this stale 
world of no surprises. Happy 
families are all alike, and their past 
is exactly like their future. 

“Hank, I haven’t asked you di- 
rectly about your cockroach theory 
before, have I? Want to tell me 
about it?” 

“1 know it sounds crazy at first. 
For one thing, cockroaches aren’t 
very smart, 1 know that. In some 
ways, they’re stupider than ants. 
And their communication equipment 
isn’t much, either. Touch and 
smell, mainly. They aren’t naturally 

38 



equipped for conquering the 
world.” 

Oddpork lit a cigar and leaned 
back, looking at the ceiling. “What 
do they do with the world when 
they get it?” 

“That’s another problem. After 
all, they don’t need the world. All 
they need is food, water, a fair 
amount of darkness and some 
warmth. But there’s the key, you 
see? 

“I mean, we humans have pro- 
vided for all of these needs, for 
many centuries. Haphazardly, 
though. So it stands to reason life 
would be better for them if we 
worked for them on a regular basis. 
But to get us to do that, they have 
to take over first.” 

He tried to blow a smoke ring, 
failed, and adjusted his tie. “Go 
on. How do they manage this 
takeover?” 

“I’m not sure, but I think they 
have help. Maybe some smart tink- 
erer wanted to see what would 
happen if he gave them good long- 
distance vision. Maybe he was so 
pleased with the result that he 
taught them to make semaphore 
signals with their feelers. The rest is 
history.” 

Dusting his lapel. Dr Grobe said, 
“I don’t quite follow. Semaphore 
signals?” 

“One cockroach is stupid. But a 
few thousand of them in good 
communication could make up a 
fair brain. Our tinkerer probably 
hastened that along by intensive 



GALAXY 




breeding and group learning prob- 
lems, killing off the failures. It 
would take ten years at the out- 
side.” 

■Really? And how long would 
tlie conquest of man take? How 
would the little insects fare against 
the armies of the world?” 

“They never need to try. Armies 
are run by governments, and gov- 
ernments are run, for all practical 
purposes, by small panels of ex- 
perts. Think tanks like the Orinoco 
Institute. And — this just occurred to 
me — for all practical purposes, you 
run the Institute.” 

For once, Dr Grobe did not look 
surprised. “Oh, so I’m in on the 
plot, am I?” 

“We’re all so crazy, we really 
depend on you. You can ensure that 
we work for the good of the cock- 
roaches, or else you can get rid of 
us — send us away, or encourage our 
suicides.” 

“Why should I do that?” 

“Because you are afraid of 
them.” 

“Not at all.” But his hand 
twitched, and a little cigar ash fell 
on his immaculate trousers. I felt 
my point was proved. 

“Damn. I’ll have to sponge that. 
Excuse me.” 

Ke stepped into his private wash- 
room and closed the door. My 
feeling of triumph suddenly faded. 
Maybe I was finally cracking. What 
evidence did I really have? 

On the other hand. Dr Grobe was 
taking a long time in there. I stole 



over to the washroom door and lis- 
tened. 

“. .verge of suicide. ,” he 
murmured. “. .yes. .give up the 
idea, but. .yes, that’s what I. .” 

I threw back the door on a tradi- 
tional spy scene. In the half 
darkness. Dr G hunched over the 
medicine cabinet, speaking into a 
microphone. He wore earphones. 

“Hank, don’t be a foo — ” 

I hit him, not hard, and he sat 
down on the edge of the bathtub. 
He looked resigned. 

“So this is my imagined conspir- 
acy, is it? Where do these wires 
lead?” 

.They led inside the medicine 
cabinet, to a tiny apparatus. A doz- 
en brown ellipses had clustered 
about it, like a family around the 
TV. 

“Let me explain,” he said. 

“Explanations are unnecessary, 
doctor. I just want to get out of 
here, unless your six-legged friends 
can stop me.” 

“They might. So could I. I could 
order the guards to shoot you. I 
could have you put away with your 
crazy friends. I could even have 
you tried for murder, just now.” 

“Murder?” I followed his gaz, 
back to the office. From under iIk 
desk, a pair of feet. “Who’s that?” 

“Hel Rasmussen. Poisoned him 
self a few minutes before you came 
in. Believe me, it wasn’t pleasant, 
seeing the poor fellow holding a 
bottle of cyanide to his armpit. He 
left a note blaming you, in a way.”

“Me!” 

“You were the last straw. This 
afternoon, he saw you take an ax 
and deliberately cut down one of 
those beautiful maple trees in the 
yard. Destruction of beauty — it was 
too much for him.” 

Trees again. I went to the office 
window and looked out at the flood- 
lit landscape. One of the maples 
was missing. 

Dr Grobe and I sat down again at 
our respective interview stations 
while I thought this over. Blenheim 
and his mask came into it, I was 
sure of that. But why? 

GROBE fished his lifeless cigar 
from the ashtray. “The point is, I 
can stop you from making any trou- 
ble for me. So you may as well 
hear me out.” He scratched a match 
on the sole of Hel’s shoe and relit 
the cigar. 

. “All right, Oddpork. You win. 
What happens now?” 

“Nothing much. Nothing at all. 
If my profession has any meaning, 
it’s to keep things from happen- 
ing.” He blew out the match. “I’m 
selling ordinary life. Happiness, as 
you must now see, lies in develop- 
ing a pleasant, comfortable and 
productive routine — ^and then stick- 
ing to it. No unpleasant surprises. 
No shocks. Psychiatry has always 
aimed for that, and now it is within 
our grasp. The cockroach conspir- 
acy hasn’t taken over the world, 
but it has taken over the Institute — 
and it’s our salvation. 



“You see. Hank, our bargain 
isn’t one-sided. We give them a lit- 
tle shelter, a few scraps of food. 
But they give us something far 
more important: real organization. 
The life of pure routine.” 

I snorted. “Like hurrying after 
trains? Or wearing ourselves out on 
assembly line work? Or maybe 
grinding our lives away in boring 
offices? Punching time clocks and 
marching in formation?” 

“None of the above, thank you. 
Hank, cockroaches never hurry to 
anything but dinner. They wouldn’t 
march in formation except for fun. 
They are free — yet they are part of 
a highly organized society. And this 
can be ours.” 

“If we’re all put in detention 
camps.” 

“Listen, those camps are only a 
stage. So what if a few million 
grumblers get sterilized and shut 
away for a year or’ two? Think of 
the billions of happy, decent citi- 
zens, enjoying a freedom they have 
earned. Someday, every man will 
live exactly as he pleases — and his 
pleasure will lie in serving his fel- 
low men.” 

Put like that, it was persuasive. 
Another half-hour of this and I was 
all but convinced. 

“Sleep on it, eh. Hank? Let me 
know tomorrow what you think.” 
His large hand on my shoulder 
guided me to the door. 

“You may be right,’’ I said, 
smiling back at him. I meant it, 
too. Even though the last thing I 




40 



GALAXY 




saw, as the door closed, was a 
stream of glistening brown that 
came from under the washroom 
door and disappeared underneath the 
desk. 



1 SAT UP in my own office most of 
the night, staring out at the maple 
stump. There was no way out: 
Either I worked for Periplaneta 
americana and gradually turned into 
a kind of moral cockroach myself, 
or I was killed. And there were cer- 
tain advantages to either choice. 

I was about to turn on the video 
recorded to leave a suicide note, 
when I noticed the cassette was al- 
ready recorded. I ran it back and 
played it. 

Blenheim came on, wearing my 
face and my usual suit. 

“They think I’m you. Hank, dic- 
tating soine notes. Right now you’re 
really at my house, reading a dull 
book in the library. So dull, in fact, 
that it’s guaranteed to put you into a 
light trance. When I’m safely back, 
Edna will come in and wake you. 

“She’s not as loony as she 
seems. The black eye is inked for 
her telescope, and the funny cap 
with lines on it, that looks like mar- 
celled hair, that’s a weathermap. I 
won’t explain why she’s doing 
astronomy — you’ll understand in 
time. 

“On the other hand, she’s got a 
fixation that the stars are nothing 
but the shiny backs of cockroaches, 
treading around the heavenly

spheres. It makes a kind of sense 
when you think about it: Perip- 
laneta means around the world, and 
jamerica being the home of the 
Star-Spangled Banner. 

“Speaking of national anthems, 
Mexico’s is La Cucaracha — another 
cockroach reference. They seem to 
be taking over this message! 

“The gang and I have been think- 
ing about bugs a lot lately. Of 
course Pawlie has always thought 
about them, but the rest of us. 

1 missed the next part. So Pawlie 
was at the madhouse? And they 
hadn’t told me? 

“. when I started work on the 
famous glass pancakes. 1 discovered 
a peculiar feature of glass discs, 
such as those found on clock faces. 

“Say, you can do us a favor. I’m 
coming around at dawn with the 
gang, to show you a gadget or two. 
We haven’t got all the bugs out of 
them yet, but — will you go into Dr 
Grobe’s office at dawn, and check 
the time on his clock? But first, 
smash the glass on his window, will 
you? Thanks. I’ll compensate him 
for it later. 

“Then go outside the building, 
but on no account stand between the 
maple stump, and the broken win- 
dow. The best place to wait is the 
little bluff to the North, where 
you’ll have a good view of the 
demonstration. We’ll meet you 
there. 

“Right now you see our ideas 
darkly, as through a pancake, I 
guess. But soon you’ll understand. 

42 



You see, we’re a kind of cockroach 
ourselves. 

1 mean, living on scraps of sani- 
ty. We have to speak in parables 
and work in silly ways because they 
can’t. They live in a comfortable 
kind of world where elephants have 
their feet cut off to make umbrella 
stands. We have to to make good 
use of the three-legged elephants, 
and other left-overs. 

“Don’t bother destroying this 
cassette. It won’t mean a thing to 
any right-living insect.’’ 

It didn’t mean much to me, not 
yet. Cockroaches in the stars? 
Clocks ? There were silly questions I 
had to ask. 



There was one question I’d al- 
ready asked, that still needed an 
answer. Pawlie had been messing 
arund in her lab, when I asked her 
to marry me. Two years ago, was 
it? Or three? 

“But you don’t like cockroaches,” 
she said. 

“No, and I’ll never ask a cock- 
roach for its claw in marriage.” 1 
looked over her shoulder into the 
glass cage. “What’s so interesting 
about these?” 

“Well, for one thing, they’re not 
laboratory animals. I caught them 
myself in the basement here at the 
Institute. See? Those roundish ones 
are the numphs — sexless adoles- 
cents. Cute, aren’t they?” 

I had to admit they were. A little. 

GALAXY 




“They look like the fat black ex- 
clamation points in comic strips,” 1 
observed. 

“They’re certainly healthy, all of 
them. I’ve never seen any like 
them. I — that’s funny.” She went 
and fetched a book, and looked 
from some illustration to the speci- 
mens behind glass. 

“What’s funny?” 

“Look, I’m going to be dissect- 
ing the rest of the afternoon. Meet 
you for dinner. Bye.” 

“You haven’t answered my ques- 
tion, Pawlie.” 

“Bye.” 

That was the last I saw of her. 
Later, Dr Grobe put it about that 
she’d been found in some distant 
city, hopelessly insane. Still later, 
George Hoad cut his throat. 

The floodlights went off, and I 
could see dawn grayness and mist. I 
took a can of beans and went for a 
stroll outside. 

One of the guards nodded a wary 
greeting. They and their cats were 
always jumpiest at this time of day. 
“Everyting all right, officer?” 
“Yeah. Call me crazy, but I 
think I Just heard an elephant.” 

When he and his puma were out 
of sight, I heaved the can of beans 
through Dr Grobe’s lighted window. 

“What the hell?” he shouted. I 
slipped back to my office, waited a 
few minutes, and then went to see 
him. 

A slender ray came through the 

ELEPHANT WITH WOODEN LEG 



broken window and struck the clock 
on the opposite wall. Grobe sat 
transfixed, staring at it with more 
surprise than ever. And no wonder, 
for the clock had become a parrot. 

“Relax, Oddpork,” I said. “It’s 
only some funny kind of hologram 
in the clock face, worked by a laser 
from the lawn. You look like a 
comic villain, sitting there with that 
cigar stub in your face.” 

The cigar stub moved. Looking 
closer, I saw it was made up of the 
packed tails of a few cockroaches, 
trying to force themselves between 
his closed lips. More ran up from 
his spotless collar and joined them, 
and others made for his nostrils. 
One approached the queue at the 
mouth, found a comrade stuck 
there, and had a nibble at its kick- 
ing hind leg. 

“Get away! Get away!” I gave 
Grobe a shake to dislodge them, 
and his mouth fell open. A brown 
flood of kicking bodies tumbled out 
and down, over his well-cut lapels. 

I HAD STOPPED shuddering by the 
time I joined the others on the 
bluff. Pawlie and Blenheim were 
missing. Edna stopped scanning the 
horizon with her brass telescope 
long enough to introduce me to the 
pretty twins, Alice and Celia. They 
sat in the grass beside a tangled 
heap of revolvers, polishing their 
patent-leather tap shoes. 

The ubiquitous Rastus was wip- 
ing off his burnt cork makeup. I 



43 




asked him why. 

“Don’t need it anymore. Last 
night it was my camouflage. I was 
out in the woods, cutting a path 
through the electric fence. Quite a 
wide path, as you’ll understand.” 

He continued removing the black 
until 1 recognized the late George 
Hoad. 

“George! But you cut your 
throat, remember? Mopping up 
blood — ” 

“Hank, that was your blood. It 
was you who cut your throat in the 
Gents, after Pawlie vanished. Re- 
member?” 

1 did, giddily. “What happened 
to you, then?” 

“Your suicide attempt helped me 
make up my mind; I quite the Insti- 
tute next day. You were still in the 
hospital.” 

Still giddy, I turned to watch Joe 
Feeney operating the curious laser 
I’d seen in the library. Making par- 
rots out of clocks. 

“I understand now,’’ I said. 
“But what’s the watermelon for?” 

“Cheap cooling device.” 

“And the ‘flag’?” I indicated the 
shawl-stick arrangement. 

“To rally round. I stuck it in the 
melon because the umbrella stand 
was in use. They were trying to use 
it—” 

“Look!” Edna cried. “The at- 
tack begins!” She handed me a 
second telescope. 

All I saw below was the lone fig- 
ure of Blenheim in his diving suit, 
shuffling slowly up from the river 

44 



mist to face seven guards arid two 
pumas. 

He seemed to be juggling 
croquet balls. 

“Why don’t we help him?” I 
shouted. “Don’t just sit here shin- 
ing shoes and idling.” 

The twins giggled. “We’ve al- 
ready helped some,” said Alice, 
nodding at the pile of weapons. 
“We made friends with the 
guards.” 

I got the point when those below 
pulled their guns on Blenheim. As 
each man drew, he looked at his 
gun and then threw it away. 

“What a waste,” Celia sighed. 
“Those guns are made from just 
about the best chocolate you can 
get.” 

Blenheim played his parlor trick 
on the nearest guard: One juggled 
ball flew high, the guard looked up, 
and a second ball clipped him on 
the upturned chin. 

Now the puma guards went into 
action. 

“I can’t look,” I said, my eye 
glued to the telescope. One of the 
animals stopped to sniff at a sticky 
revolver, but the other headed 
straight for his quarry. He leapt up, 
trying to fasten his claws into the 
stranger’s big brass head. 

Out of the river mist came a ter- 
rible cry, and then a terrible sight: a 
hobbling gray hulk that resolved 
into a charging elephant. 

Charging diagonally, so it looked 
even larger. 

The pumas left the scene. One 

GALAXY 




fled in our direction until Alice 
snatched up a pistol and fired it in 
the air. At that sound, the guards 
decided to look for jobs elsewhere. 
After all, as Pawlie said later, you 
can’t expect a man to face a jug- 
gling diver and a mad elephant with 
a wooden leg, with nothing but a 
chocolate .38, not on rheir wages. 

Pawlie was riding on the neck of 
the elephant. When he came to a 
wobbliong stop I saw that one of 
Jumbo’s forelegs was a section of 
tree with the bark still on it. And in 
the bark, a heart with PS -I- HL, 
carved years before. 

I felt the triumph was all over — 
especially since Pawlie kept nod- 
ding her head yes at me — until 
George said: 

“Come on, gang. Let’s set it 
up.” 

Jumbo had been pulling a 
wooden sledge, bearing the Paris 
kiosk. 

Now he went off to break his fast 
on water and grass, while the rest 
of us set the thing upright. Even be- 
fore we had fuelled it with whatever 
was in the fertilizer bags, I guessed 
that it was a rocket. 

After some adjustments, the little 
door was let down, and a sweet, 
breakfast pancake odor came forth. 
Joe Feeney opened a flask of dark 
liquid and poured it in the entrance. 
The smell grew stronger. 

“Maple sap,’’ he explained. 
“From Jumbo’s wooden leg. Mixed 
with honey. And there’s oatmeal in- 
side. A farewell breakfast.” 



I looked in the little door and saw 
the inside of the ship was made like 
a metal honeycomb, plenty of 
climbing room for our -masters. 

Pawlie came from ihe building 
with a few cockroaches in a jar, and 
let them taste our wares. Then, all 
at once, it was a sak- opening at 
any big department store. We all 
stood back and let the great brown 
wave surge forward and break over 
the little rocket. 

Some of them, nyrnpiis especial- 
ly, scurried all the way up to the 
nose cone and back dowm again in 
their excitement. It all looked so 
jolly that 1 tried not tliink of their 
previous meals. 

Edna glanced at her watch. “Ten 
minutes more,’’ she said. “Or 
they’ll hit the sun.” 

I objected that we’d never get all 
of them loaded in ten minutes. 

“No,” said Pawlie. “But we’ll 
get the best and strongest. The 
shrews can keep the rest in con- 
trol.” 

Edna closed the door, and the 
twins did a vigorous tap-dance on 
the unfortunate stragglers. 

A few minutes later, a million 
members of the finest organization 
on earth were on their way to the 
stars. 

“To join their little friends,” said 
Edna. 

Pawlie and I touched hands, as 
Blenheim opened his faceplate. 
“I’ve been making this study,” he 
said, “of spontaneous combustion 
in giraffes. .” ★

SPIDER VERSUS THE HAX OF SOL III 



I’m sorry. I just can’t help it. I 
just have that kind of mind, and 
there’s nothing I can do about it. 
When Jim Baen asks me for a guest 
review, all I can visualize is a 
psychopathic butler, ex-Army no 
doubt, who instead of announcing 
the guests as they arrive, lines them 
up and begins inspecting them for 
flaws. “Suck in that gut, sister. 
You there, call that a shave?’’ I’m 
sorry, honest. 

So here’s a guest review, Jim. 

Laurels first, then brickbats, with 
the white elephant saved for last. 
I’m sorry to say that there are no 
perfect books waiting for you at 



your bookstore this month, genties 
and ladlemen. But some come 
closer than others. 

Closest is Deathbird Stories by 
Harlan Ellison (Harper & Row, 
price unknown). This, friends, is 
one king hell collection of gut- 
punching, groin-kicking, arm- 
breaking short stories, subtitled “A 
Pantheon of Modem Gods’’ and ded- 
icated to the proposition that if 
gods die when their followers stop 
believing, then gods are bom when 
beliefs crystalize. Harlan takes a 
look at some of the gods we’re rais- 
ing up these days, and makes it 
quite clear that we’d better start 



46 



learning how to placate them, like 
pronto. Written over a period of ten 
years, the stories are superbly 
crafted and chillingly effective, the 
kind of which Heinlein once said 
that you should serve a whisk- 
broom with every shot, so that the 
customer can brush the sawdust off 
him when he gets back up. But in 
the three or four times I’ve met 
Harlan, I’ve noticed a severe strain 
on our relationship in that he has 
nothing to bitch at me about, and so 
I ought to add some beefs. 

First, most of these stories will 
probably already be familiar to you 
(a margarine dildo to the first reader 
who can name an anthology of any- 
thing by anyone in the past year 
that hasn’t contained Deathbird), 
reminding one of those ten Billy 
Holiday albums with three albums 
worth of songs endlessly shuffled 
and re-dealt. “Maggie Moneyeyes,’’ 
“Along the Scenic Route,’’ 
“Paingod’’ and “Shattered Like 
A Glass Goblin’’ aren’t exactly 
obscure, for instance. 

But thass alright — somehow all 
these stories do belong thematically 
in one book. My main beef is that 
dll of Harlan’s new gods are scary. 
Pessimism is okay — but unrelieved 
pessimism seems a little unrealistic. 
Maybe all that’s on the other side is 
the sixteen-year-old perfect goom- 
bah and his divine Maserati, but 
why don’t we take a look? 

But how can you complain about 
a book that has “Whimper of 
Whipped Dogs’’ in it? 



Next in line is The Shockwave 
Rider (Harper & Row, price 
unknown — while this latter phrase 
reoccurs frequently because I’m 
working from galleys, for obvious 
reasons I can’t abbreviate it) by 
John Brunner, a Spring ’75 selec- 
tion for the SF Book Club. This one 
had seeds of greatness, but maybe it 
needed more vermiculite. It’s not a 
bad book — and Jesus knows I don’t 
want to join the “it ain’t as good as 
Stand On Zanzibar” ranks — but 
somehow it just misses. Close 
though. 

The protagonist is Nickie Haf- 
linger, who was drafted as a child 
into the government’s behaviorist- 
oriented genius factory, Tamover. 
Not content with encouraging 
natural geniuses to mature, the di- 
rectors of this institution are at- 
tempting to grow genetically- 
modified geniuses from ova in the 
laboratory. As a young man Nickie 
stumbles across a deformed and im- 
becile Mark I, becomes disil- 
lusioned with behaviorism and 
splits, removing himself from the 
national data-net and establishing a 
succession of aliases with a stolen 
computer-code, dedicating himself 
to the overthrow of Tamover and all 
it stands for. A dandy plot, and one 
that in Bmnner’s hands should have 
been Hugo material. I dunno; 
maybe he was in a hurry. Both his 
villains and the community of Pre- 
cipice (Tamover’s underground an- 
tithesis) are cut from cardboard, and 
there are a series of debate-lectures 



47 




between Nickie and the government 
interrogator who’s wringing out his 
memory that just don’t ring true. 

But the book reads well all the 
same. Individual sections are often 
brilliant, in the way that John seems 
to have copyrighted, and the mes- 
sage is incisive and timely. But as a 
story it limps. So call it the worst 
book he’s written in five years, and 
you’ve still put it two notches above 
average. It kept me turning the 
page, and its closing question has 
yet to be answered. 

Onward to a pleasant surprise. 
Somehow or other I got on Double- 
day’s SF review list a couple of 
years back, and as a result my stove 
here in Nova Scotia has never 
lacked for fire-starter. Honest to 
God, you never saw such dreck in 
your life. Comic-books without the 
pictures. But I hear they’ve got a 
new SF editor lately, and here on 
my desk, by Jesus, is an actual 
first-rate science-fiction novel from 
Doubleday, Newton and the 
Quasi-Apple, by Stanley Schmidt. 
I’d never have read it if I hadn’t 
recognized Stanley’s name from 
some fine stories in Analog, but I’m 
glad I gave it a chance. The planet 
of Ymrek, see, is at a crisis point in 
its cultural development. The 
civilized types in the city of Yng- 
mer are threatened by the barbarian 
Ketaxil, and have for defense only 
crude cannon which they don’t 
know how to aim very well. A pair 

48 



of human xenologists reluctantly 
decide to interfere by giving the 
Yngmerians technological aid in the 
form of “quasi-matter,” a won- 
drous stuff they hope to pass off as 
“nothing more than simple magic.” 
Unfortunately, at the same time a 
native genius named Terek has 
singlehandedly duplicated the work 
of Copernicus, Galileo and Newton, 
deducing laws of motion with which 
he hopes to save the day by invent- 
ing ballistics, to aim the cannon bet- 
ter. The local shaman reacts little 
better than did Galileo’s inquisitors, 
and Just as Terek has begun to con- 
vince him that jjerhaps il se muovo 
after all, in come the 
xenologists — with quasimatter trin- 
kets that don’t obey Newton’s 
Laws! Poor Terek is ceremonially 
proclaimed a Dunce, and the rest of 
the book deals with the attempts of 
the meddling but well-intentioned 
xenologists to set things right. It’s a 
dandy, and I’m proiid of Stanley for 
his refusal to yield to temptation 
and pull rabbits out of a hat for an 
ending. 

My only complaint is his failure 
to explain quasimatter rather than 
Simply describe it — but as a man 
with a trunkfull of letters saying, 
“your last story was great — but of 
course it’s not science fiction,” 
possibly I should shut up. Tasty 
stuff, Stan. 

Cliff simak’s new book. En- 
chanted Pilgramage (Putnam- 

GALAXY 




Berkley) is another one of those that 
gave me mixed feelings. If there’s a 
sequel planned, I withdraw most of 
my objections, but as it stands it 
raises more questions than it 
answers. 

To say that it’s well written 
would be more unnecessarily redun- 
dant than is absolutely called for — it 
is, after all, a Simak. The charac- 
ters are well-drawn, the menaces 
chilling, the succession of events 
compelling. But the book frustrates 
me, dammit. The first half reads 
like pure alternate-universe sword- 
and-sorcery — a little strange for 
Cliff, but what the hell. In this al- 
ternate universe men have never re- 
ally left the Middle Ages, and gob- 
lins, trolls, elves and unicorns fes- 
toon the countryside. A quest is un- 
dertaken (incidentally, quests in- 
volving a chalice or grail are a 
separate subgenre called cup-and- 
sorcery) by a band of good joes. 
Fine. 

Then halfway through the book, a 
modern-day human appears from 
our time-stream, complete with 
firestick and a Honda dragon, and 
one not unnaturally assumes that 
some of the strange goings-on are 
going to get mundane explanations. 
Only some do, and some don’t, and 
one of the most impressive menaces 
turns out for no apparent reason to 
be an alien, which dies in giving 
birth to a robot (!) that seems to do 
nothing to advance the plot. We 
learn that there are three alternate 
universes (why only three?) and that 



the third of these is a “humanist” 
world in which all the problems of 
man have been solved — but all we 
ever get to see of it is two charac- 
ters who appear only by rumor. Nor 
do we ever learn how travel be- 
tween the universes is managed, nor 
why only one not-especially-bright 
inhabitant of our own time-stream 
(named Jones, forsooth) pulled it 
off. Worst, the quest turns out to 
have been a wild-goose chase for all 
but one of its members. 

Oh hell — Cliff is just too good a 
craftsman to leave such gaping 
holes in the foundations: there has 
to be a sequel. But I wish there’d 
been words to that effect some- 
where in the galleys. 



The missing man in Katherine 
MacLean’s book of the same name 
(Putnam-Berkley) seems to be the 
protagonist — the one we are given 
just doesn’t seem real to me. No, 
amend that: he seems real for the 
first chapter (which, if my memory 
serves, appeared somewhere or 
other as a novelette — and a damned, 
good one) and then vanishes, leav- 
ing behind a cardboard simulacrum. 
There’s just no consistency to his 
character: he’s an ex-teengang 
member, big and strong when the 
plot requires it, but most of the time 
he acts like a timid chump; he is a 
professional empath, and yet he gets 
suckered into buying the 
metaphysics of a sociopath gang

leader with nary a quiver. And the 
final group of villains to be dragged

World A Conformist Utopia So 
They Can Power Trip Us (but get 
this: they’re telepathic, see. .) 
went down like two tablespoons of 
peanut butter. 

Which leaves me astounded. For 
years I have watched Kate MacLean 
write circles around a large lot of 
folks, and upon receiving the first 
novel I’ve seen by her I rejoiced, 
expecting something above average. 
But this is barely adequate. The 
first chapter, in which we meet 
George, the high-sensitivity empath 
who works as a locater for the Res- 
cue Squad, is really excellent — but 
the book as a whole lacks an inter- 
nal consistency somehow, and sus- 
pending that disbelief starts to give 
you cramps. I’m disappointed. In 
view of what Memphis Slim once 
termed the pay sitchy-ation. I’m re- 
luctant to suggest that anybody stick 
to short stories, but this just doesn’t 
work as a novel. I don’t object to a 
simple series-of-episodes — but the 
cast should be continuous. 

Getting near the bottom, now. 
Funny SF novels, when they work, 
are among the funniest things ever 
written: e.g., Niven & Gerrold’s 
The Flying Sorcerer, a sizable 
chunk of Keith Laumer’s work, and 
the new Bester novel. Some are a 
trifle strained, but still make you 



giggle consistently: e.g. Bob 
Toomey’s World of Trouble. And 
some are as strained as the stuff that 
goes in I.V. bottles: e.g.. The Wilk 
Are Among Us, by Isidore Haiblum 
(Doubleday, $5.95). 

Since Stan Schmidt’s book had 
turned out so well, I decided to try 
the one that came with it; but when 
I got to the part where the ferocious 
and homicidal nill says to the alien 
protagonist, “If I wasn’t a bit under 
the weather, and you didn’t have 
that crude mind-block on — really, 
under ordinary conditions it 
wouldn’t do at all, you know — I’d 
give you such a hit!’’ I began to 
suspect that the stack of handker- 
chiefs I’d laid in against tears of 
laughter might be superfluous. 
Everybody in the book is named 
Leonard or Ernest or Marvin, ex- 
traterrestrials who’ve never heard of 
Earth call each other boychik, and 
at odd intervals Haiblum succumbs 
to Zelazny’s Syndrome: the habit of 
stringing together sentence frag- 
ments. 

As paragraphs. 

In groups of six or seven. 

For no discernible reason. 

Like a freshman art student. 

Making a collage. 

Or some. 

Thing. 

Followed by two skipped lines 
and a block of more or less standard 
copy. There’s a lot of action, a cast 
of thousands, and a plot that would 
confound a panel consisting of

It is curious that the science-

out there, and maybe some of you 
are Trekkie-type groupies, and I re- 
ally truly do believe that a reviewer 
has a duty to finish a book before 
publishing his views on it, but hon- 
est to Christ, Fellas. The Life of

ply above and beyond the call of

that at the age of two, Lovecraft’s 
golden curls led his landlady to call 
him “Little Sunshine”? 

I have in my possession a volume 



of comparable size, which was 
commissioned by New York State, 
printed at Taxpayers’ expense in 
1947, and bought by the same tax- 
payers for the State University Li- 
brary system, from which I ulti- 
mately stole it, leaving behind five 
identical copies none of which has 
ever been checked out. It is an 
800-page study of the ruffed grouse, 
a bird so stupid you can blow out 
the brains of one without disturbing 
the one next to it. It took six men 
to write, and one of the men later 
produced a 400-page sequel. I take 
it down from the shelf whenever 
I’m feeling especially useless and 
futile, and pore over the maps and 
graphs and close-ups of grouse 
droppings, and I feel better. 

At long last I’ve found a compan- 
ion volume. 

If you’re an English major who 
believes you must know the man to 
properly read and evaluate his 
works (don’t laugh — I was one 
once) then by all means pick this 
book up — if you can (little joke 
there). If you’re an Ashley user, I 
should advise you that the binding 
is damnably difficult to destroy, and 
it’s too big to use all at once. If 
you’re H.P. Lovecraft, let me know 
what you think of it. 

And so opens 1975 in the SF puh-

HELIUM 

Arsen Darnay 



WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

A THOUSAND YEARS after a 
series of limited nuclear wars 
Americans have polarized into 
two groups — Structure-Folk, who 
live in huge constructions along 
the coasts (Union), and Tribes- 
men, who occupy Hinterland. 

The urban structures reach 
three thousand meters into the 
sky and depend on the levitating 
effect of gravitron, a field-force 
generated in tower pits. Liquid 
Helium is needed to cool the 
gravitron reaction. In the absence 
of tbe gas, structure collapse 
is inevitable — Structure-Man’s 
greatest dread. 

The only economical source of 



Helium is in Texahoma, an area 
controlled by the Ecofreak tribe. 
Tribesmen have a powerful anti- 
technology ideology-verging-on- 
religion, and to them Union is the 
incarnation of evil, but they are 
coerced into cooperation by 
Union’s atomic power. 

Union, however, must use this 
power sparingly lest it destroy the 
Helium extraction and distribu- 
tion facilities. Moreover, Ecofreak 
demands high-ranking hostages 
who live in the most vulnerable 
tribal settlements, exposed to 
atomic attack along with the na- 
tives. The situation thus is one of 
precarious balance. 

In the year 1056, MYCAL 
BONO arrives in Ricardo, capital 



52 





of Union. Bono and his delegation 
have come to renegotiate Helium 
Deliveries — a “Helium Round.” 
But this time Bono has a hidden 
objective — to obtain some elec- 
tronic parts that the Activists, a 
radical group within the Ecofreak 
tribe who have recently gained 
power, need to bring to fruition 
their plan to throw off the 
structure-yoke once and for all. 

Following a reception in one of 
Ricardo’s five towers, RIVERA 
FRENCH, intelligence chief of the 
Bureau of Tribal Affairs, reports 
to RESTON PROCTOR, Union’s 
Chief Negotiator and head of 
BTA. Both men are upset because 
Ecofreak’s Activist faction is an 
unknown quantity. In the past 



BTA has always negotiated with 
Accommodationists. The men 
know nothing about Mycal Bono 
and not much more about 
JONNY TACK, Ecofreak’s ruth- 
less young leader. 

Mention of Tack reminds Proc- 
tor of a troublesome episode in- 
volving REGINA UNSLER, only 
daughter of Bernard Unsler, 
Union’s leader “the Unifier”. 
During a stay in Ricardo, Tack and 
Regina fell in love, suggesting to 
the Unifier the notion of a Grand 
Alliance between Union and Hin- 
terland to be achieved by 
intermarriage — an idea abhorrent 
both to Proctor and to Jonny Tack’s 
father, both hardliners. The mar- 
riage didn’t come off. 



53 




Aside from the fact that the Ac- 
tivists represent an unknown 
quantity, Proctor is also worried 
because he is fomenting a plot to 
overthrow the Unsler dynasty — a 
move that will require Ecofreak 
help. Also, BLOTTlNGHAM, 
Unsler’s closest aide, has been 
unusually interested in the negoti- 
ations. Proctor instructs French 
to meet with ANDROS BARNEY, 
Ecofreak’s permanent ambas- 
sador in Ricardo, to learn more 
about the tribe’s strategy before 
the talks begin a week later. 

Barney is a hold-over Accom- 
modationist who wants to see 
Jonny Tack fail politically. He 
tricks FRANCO DART, an old 
man in Bono’s group, into reveal- 
ing that Ecofre^ has developed a 
new device that inhibits nuclear 
reactions. Part of the device is a 
switch made of silcoplast (a cheap 
synthetic) welded to copper. Only 
Union can do the welding, which 
requires special facilities. Over 
some years Ecofreak could de- 
velop the welding technology, but 
Jonny Tack is impatient and 
wants to get the sil-parts in a 
hurry. Later Barney tells Rivera 
French enough to put Union on 
its guard. 

After delivering the news to 
Proctor at a late-night ball game, 
French is attacked on his way 
home by a group of “flames,” 
members of an upper-class cult 
led by SIDNEY UNSLER, the 
Unifier’s son and heir. French kills 
one of the flames during a chase 
and escapes. The epidsode brings 
home to French again the fact 
that Sidney’s power is growing as 
the Unifier’s faculties slowly fail. 

54 



Sidney and his flames delight 
especi^ly in ambushing and kill- 
ing members of BTA. Sidney re- 
sents Proctor’s power and popu- 
larity. 

The traditional Opening Ball is 
held in Top Level, Unsler’s do- 
main, the following evening. 
French is present with MIRI, his 
wife — an artist and a member of 
a women’s cult called Madonna. 

Regina Unsler, who has been 
watching developments both with 
practical interest and with nostal- 
gic memories of her love affair 
with Tack, arrives at the ball with 
a plan to secure her own escape 
from Union. Her brother Sidney 
has oppressed her, and under the 
tutelage of her spiritual advisor, 
SISTER SERENITA, she plans to 
escape to Hinterland. To do so 
she captivates Bono. Meanwhile 
she also snubs CLAFTO MEYER, 
a prominent flame and the man 
who, with others, attacked French 
the night before. 

Bono has spent a painful week 
trying to adjust to the powerful 
gravitron vibrations in Ricardo 
(he belongs to the five percent of 
Tribesmen who find adjustment 
difficult). 

During the week he has been 
plagued by a recurring memory 
of his youth, hunting the man- 
sized Harvey hare, a mutant rab- 
bit whose escape mechanism is a 
cloying telepathic pulse of love. 
The hunter must overcome his af- 
fection to achieve a kill. 

On the morning of the ball, 
Bono finally experienced release 
from pain. Now he is giddy and 
disoriented and promptly falls for 
Regina. When she invites him to 



GALAXY 




her domain he willingly 
complies — only to And her much 
less yielding in the privacy of her 
roof-top garden. Before she can 
yield herself, she says, she must 
have a sign of Bono’s true affec- 
tion. She demands that Bono re- 
quest her as the Helium hostage 
of 1056. Only after she has seen 
the news on Media that he has 
done so will she be his. 

Back at the ball, Clafto Meyer 
has recognized French from the 
night before. French and Miri flee 
from pursuing flames and man- 
age to lose them, but only after 
another flame loses his life. They 
reach Top Level’s parking lot 
where Miri hides in a jump tube 
(one-man transport) while French 
goes exploring. He discovers that 
the streets are blocked by flames. 

Proctor, meanwhile is over- 
come with rage while he impo- 
tently watches the flames pursue 
French and Miri from the ball- 
room; he conceives a plan of re- 
taliation against Sidney’s Flames 
— ‘‘Operation Hairy Scary.” 

„ MEDITATION 

Trench lay on the bed in his 
underwear, one leg propped up. His 
eyes rested on Miri’s dark silhou- 
ette. She stood by the food of the bed 
and undressed before him in the 
half-light from the bath. The chaste 
gown fell to her waist. Then she 
dropped it to the floor and stepped 
out. Her arms went back to her 
back and her bra popped off. His 
eyes rested on her shadowy breasts. 
She wiggled out of panties and 
stood naked for a second, turned 
toward him, dressed only in a gold- 
en earring. 

HELIUM 



“I must meditate,” she said. 

French smiled and nodded, ad- 
miring her cool. They had just es- 
caped death and had been shown 
into this dingy cubicle empty of 
furniture, but filled with an unusu- 
ally strong gravitron hum. A cold 
and musty room. A late hour. Un- 
usual circumstances. Nevertheless 
Miri remembered her spiritual 
chores. 

She sank down to the floor. Over 
the bed’s edge French saw her 
shoulders, neck, and face. Her eyes 
were closed. She sat with her legs 
crossed and her hands on her knees. 
In the mood of relaxation he now 
felt, the tense anxieties of the past 
hour still there like a residue at the 
bottom of his perceptions, her very 
posture aroused him. The physical 
alignment of her body signalled two 
kinds of receptivity — spiritual and 
sexual. 

His face softened, and he 
watched his profile through eyes 
clouded with a kind of tenderness. 
He often watched her like this, 
thinking the same thought. 

He waited a long time. Miri 
tripped out in a trance, her spirit 
in other dimensions. She sought the 
limpid light of truth, a stale of 
quiescent calm. Such states came 
very rarely, she said. Instead she' 
usually had visions — silly, prophe- 
tic, disturbing. 

As he watched her, he saw again 
a faint light around her head — or 
thought he saw it. French was never 
certain whether or not Miri really 
radiated a kind of strange energy or 
whether he merely imagined it. To 
watch her meditate was itself a kind 
of meditation. It engendered im- 
ages. 



55 




Devotee of the Cosmic Lady. 

French knew next to nothing 
about the Cult. They taught magical 
pra'ctices — like this technique which 
draped Miri’s head and shoulders in 
a nimbus of light. He swore he saw 
a light, although its subtle radiance 
faded when his concentration 
slipped. Secretive, the sisters of 
the Cult. They claimed and had very 
real powers. They claimed to see 
the future in visions or in books of 
oracles — but darkly, darkly. Not 
with the precision French needed 
for his work. Prophecy had its 
limits. They had a doctrine that 
thoughts took on reality if held with 
strong emotion. Ritual lustrations 
and such things. Miri left Saturday 
evenings to partake of the mys- 
teries. When she returned she was 
always receptive — oh, she was re- 
ceptive! 

French approved of the Cult, not 
so much because he approved of the 
occult or the transcendental but be- 
cause he disapproved of nothing 
Miri loved. He was not religious 
himself. He saw the world in its ir- 
reducible particularities, not in col- 
lective symbols. If he longed to 
worship, he could always reach out. 

You are my Cosmic Lady, he 
thought. When / embrace you, I 
embrace the world. When you 
smile, it's sunny. When you frown, 
it’s clouds. Your laughter tingles my 
spine like water. Your hands caress 
me like wind. Your hair shines and 
rolls like mutagrass. Your scent is 
the sage. Your touch is soft like 
Harvey pelt. Your body bucks like a 
Hinterland pony when we make 
love. Your eyes are stars, your teeth 
white cliffs in the distance. 

He watched her and waited. 



Deep in meditation, Miri felt 
Frenchy’s enveloping presence. His 
mood penetrated her sensitized 
psyche — and yet she had induced it 
or amplified it by her visions. His 
adoration sparkled with erotic ten- 
sion. He’d soon grow restless, she 
knew. She smiled inwardly and let 
the visions of maternity slowly fade 
away until there was nothing before 
her eyes but the darkness behind her 
lids. 

French decided he had waited 
long enough. He leapt from the bed 
and tiptoed behind her. Kneeling 
down, he began to massage her skin 
gently. She radiated heat. The Cult 
also taught them how to control the 
body’s temperature. His hands 
pressed and kneaded her shoulders 
and back. He grew passionate. 

He rubbed and massaged and 
moved closer and closer until he 
pressed up against her. He slipped 
his hands under her arms and cupped 
her breasts. His mouth muzzled 
her neck and chewed her right ear- 
lobe, the one free of adornment. 
His breath was hot and acrid with 
desire. Slowly he worked his hands 
down over her quivering belly into, 
her lap. 

Miri pretended not to feel him. 
She detached herself from her body 
and perched her soul into a comer 
of the room like a yellow bird. 
From there she watched him and 
watched herself as if she were look- 
ing at an ancient etching illustrating 
some book on love-yoga. But then 
came a point when the urgency of 
nerves summoned the bird back 
from its perch. She became one 
with her body, and with a low 
moan she twisted out of the lotus 
posture and drew him into her arms.

They rose after a moment and 
jumped on the bed, giggling. Her 
legs held him tightly while he 
worked. Her toes probed rythmi- 
cally toward the ceiling. He covered 
her face with little bites, growling. 
She lowed like a calf. 

Oh, beautiful, trembling flesh. 
Oh, exquisite sex. Oh, wonderful 
gorge. Oh, meat of the god- 
dess. 

The rush of breathing subsided at 
last. They rolled to the side, nuz- 
zling, stroking in silence. Gravitron 
vibrations pulsed in the air. French 
placed tiny kisses on her forehead. 
Her breathing grew shallow. She 
fell asleep. 

He wormed his left arm out from 
beneath her and set his new digital 
watch for six o’clock. He wouldn’t 
get much sleep, but every little bit 
would help. The light was still on 
in the bathroom. Should he disen- 
tangle himself and put it out? No. 
He closed his eyes and immediately 
saw shadowy dream images. In 
their contemplation he passed over 
to the other side. 

French started. Six o’clock? Yes. 
He felt a searing pain against his 
wrist. He fumbled and turned off 
the heat-alarm. Miri’s legs still held 
his body in a scissor grip. They lay 
much as they’d fallen asleep. He 
had to get up, but his body resisted. 
It seemed as if he hadn’t slept at 
all. Miri was warm. Perfume lay on 
her skin like a wraith over waters. 
Her breath moved against his naked 
arm. 

He hovered between sleep and 
waking, thinking in rythm with her 
breath. 

Miri-mine, Miri-qiine. Sleep 
reached for his awareness again, but 



he shook it off. He had to get up, 
had to. His lips sought Miri’s 
birthmark. Then he gingerly lifted 
her leg, rolled out of her earthy 
grip, and walked barefoot and 
naked to the showers. All shivering 
business now, he made a plan. 

He was in the Ecofreak embassy 
and he had to get out undetected by 
flames. Barney had saved her life 
the night before. They had left Top 
Level surrounded by tribesmen. The 
flames hadn’t dared to cause an in- 
cident, not with men who controlled 
Helium. But they had followed the 
group all the way to the doors of 
the embassy. Despite strong protests 
from Franco Dart, Barney had taken 
them in. But in deference to the Ac- 
tivist, Barney had put them up in an 
unused wing. Therefore the strong 
gravitron vibrations. Someone had 
failed to do the necessary mainte- 
nance around here. 

French took a shower and pon- 
dered his situation. He expected that 
the flames were still out there, wait- 
ing. If he wanted to arrive at the 
first negotiating session on time — 
without the humiliation of doing so 
under Ecofreak protection — he had 
to get away now undetected. Which 
meant a disguise of some sort. And 
it would be best to leave Miri here, 
where she was safe, until he could 
fetch her with a group of men. 

He shaved with a dirty old razor 
someone had left behind. Then he 
rummaged about in the cubicle’s 
built-in closet trying on odd pieces 
of tribal clothing visitors had aban- 
doned here. Judging by the pattern 
of beads, this cubohome hadn’t 
been used in years. 

In the midst of these activities, 
French discovered a section of wall 



HELIUM 



57 




patched over with a plate of plasto- 
steel screwed into place. He realized 
at once that the cubicle abutted a 
service chasm. His troubles were 
over. He could get out with no 
trouble at all. 

Soon he was at work with a stiff 
saniblade ticm the shaver. The plate 
came olf easily. Behind it gaped a 
ragged hole in the eroded wall, and 
gravinon sparks flew about. The 
suction pulled him but he resisted. 
Only his blond locks moved tosvaid 
the opening. 

French wrote a note for Miri. 
Then he put on the tribal tunic (a 
little too small) and a tribal hat (a 
little too big). He crawled out into 
the humming darkness, reached in- 
side and lifted the plate. Chasm 
vacuum sucked the metal back into 
place. He was on his way. 



THE HOSTAGE DEMAND 

According to tradition, the first 
session of the Helium round was 
scheduled to begin at eight in the 
morning. Based on the same tradi- 
tion, no one expected the Ecofreaks 
until a quarter to nine at the ear- 
liest. Ritualized discourtesy be- 
longed to the negotiations as much 
as ihe toast upon arrival and the 
Top Level ball. 

Promptly at eight-forty, French 
slapped his knees and rose from his 
chair in Proctor’s office. He waited 
until the speaker had finished. 
Then, with a glance at the senior 
members of the negotiating team 
who had assembled for a last-minute 
session. He said: “I’d better go and do 
my chores.’’ 

Proctor nodded, and French left. 

58 



By hallway, elevator, and another 
hallway, French reached BTA’s 
lobby. He nodded to the guards on 
his left and took up a stand before 
the door. Arms folded across his 
chest, he stared through glass at 
shallow stairs that fanned out and 
down to the idewalk and the stow 
edge-lanes or the movebelt. Morn- 
ing crowds Tilled the belt. French 
lifted his eyes to the airspace above 
and surveyeri the jump tube traffic 
coming and going. From time to 
time utility autipers and levi-limos 
passed in the middle spurting blue 
flames from tail-jets. 

French preferred idle waiting to 
the gloom th' the meeting he had 
just escaped — where the Office of 
Intelligence in general and French 
in particular had been under snivel- 
ing attack. 

Everyone in the meeting, and 
above all Proctor — who’d set the 
tone and whom everyone had avidly 
aped — had made much of Bono’s 
behavior the night before. French’s 
characterization of the man as a 
strict constructionist had been 
ridiculed and questioned. How 
could BTA enter the negotiations 
with such poor intelligence esti- 
mates? The performance of the Of- 
fice of Intel hgence had been most 
lackadaisicui on this issue. And 
other such bi ,ii! 

They cal:: .l themselves nego- 
tiators, F;.;;ch thought with 
scorn. At, ci- kiail parties they told 
tall tales of fancy dancing and 
eyeball-to-eycball confrontations. In 
practice they demanded hard 
guarantees well in advance that ev- 
erything would go smoothly and 
that no one would get the slightest 
bit of heat. 



GALAXY 




French could understand Proctor’s 
anxieties to some extent. Proctor 
worried about the Secret Agenda. 
He feared that Ecofreak had made 
an end run. The big corporate in- 
terests and Bernard Unsler — both 
wanted Accommodation. The corpo- 
rations sought unimpeded trade with 
Hinterland without the paternal in- 
terventions of BTA. Unsler fol- 
lowed his oldest ambitions — to rule 
the entire American subcontinent, as 
his predecessors had done. These 
two interests conspired with Eco- 
freak to bring about Accommodation 
at last, lulling BTA by a show of 
Activism. This was Proctor’s thesis. 

It was all nonsense, of course. 
Nevertheless, the men had all 
sagely nodded. Then they’d begun 
to blabber about Regina Unsler. 
French had quietly suggested that 
Five-percenters often suffered from 
behavioral aberrations. A chorus 
had shouted him down, hands wav- 
ing in deprecation. 

An inauspicious beginning, 
French thought. 

Yes, inauspicious. 

When he had arrived early in the 
morning, still in his ill-fitting tribal 
clothes, he’d gone to report to Proc- 
tor and had found Dickens with his 
security chiefs in Proctor’s office, 
all spread out on chairs and 
couches. They were planning Oper- 
ation Hairy Scary. 

The mere fact that they were in 
Proctor’s office rather than in one 
of the conference rooms of the Of- 
fice of Security had alerted French. 
The name of the operation had also 
given him pause. 

Hairy Scary: a strangely juvenile 
code name for what seemed very 
serious business. 



Dickens and his people were busy 
with several simulators and with in- 
tricate three-dimensional maps of 
Ricardo’s towers. Spots on the 
maps were marked “points of at- 
tack.’’ In the brief time French 
spent in the office, he learned the 
name of the operation and gathered 
that Sidney’s flames would be the 
target. Trays of stale refreshments 
and mounds of narrow printout 
scripto pointed to an all-night ses- 
sion. 

His misgivings grew when he 
saw Proctor in the midst of it all. 
Proctor’s eyes were red from lack 
of sleep, and yet they gleamed with 
boyish excitement — disturbing in a 
man of Proctor’s usually stony re- 
serve. French was reminded of the 
fact that he knew almost nothing 
about Proctor’s background; nobody 
did. He came out of the past, ready 
made. French soon gathered that 
Proctor didn’t want him there. The 
Negotiator scowled at French’s tri- 
bal costume. He sent French off to 
gather the negotiating team for a 
meeting at a later time. He waved a 
hand: “Get into some decent cloth- 
ing.’’ Then he turned back ea- 
gerly to Operation Hairy Scary. 

Playing little games. 

French rocked back and forth on 
his heels. He liked neither the 
exuberance surrounding Hairy 
Scary — ostensibly an action 

triggered by Clafto Meyer’s mur- 
derous pursuit last night — nor the 
pessimistic approach to the negotia- 
tions. 

Men should sleep at night, he 
told himself. When they stayed up 
all night, they lost perspective. 

A glance at his watch told him it 
was a quarter to the hour. The dele- 



HELIUM 



59 




gation should be here by now. He 
pulled down on the stiff new robe 
he’d bought from the commissary in 
the BTA complex. Tillinghast, the 
manager, had been obliged to come 
in early to sell French a robe, which 
the merchant had really appre- 
ciated — but French hadn’t dared to 
go home for proper clothes, and 
neither could he receive the delega- 
tion in a mockery of their own 
dress. 

Punctual to the minute. Ecofreak 
arrived. Their jump tubes fell down 
from the traffic and settled on the 
sidewalk. Little doors opened. The 
tribesmen gathered into a clump and 
then, in unison, they came up the 
stairs toward the glass door. French 
put on a smile while his eyes 
searched the ascending delegates. 

Bono was not among them. Dart 
walked at the head of the group. 
French experienced a twinge of 
worry. His mind flashed up a mem- 
ory of jump tubes in a shadowy 
garage, the Unsler flower. ... He 
pushed the glass door open, face 
still frozen in a smile. 

After a series of perfunctory 
handshakes, French led the delega- 
tion toward the negotiating hall — a 
cavernous expanse built in the 
‘burgher’ style of another age. It 
was somewhat overwhelming, with 
its vast glitter, sparkle, and shine 
from the chandeliers and huge 
mosaics made of precious stones. In 
the center a large oval table rested 
on sinuous legs. Chairs carved from 
egg-shaped pieces of obduplast 
stood around the table. Smiling un- 
certainly, the BTA complement, 
minus Proctor, already waited. 

Gnarled hand on robe sleeve. 
Dart pulled French aside. His eyes 

60 



looked at French and evaded at the 
same time. 

“The Chief of Mission has been 
detained,” Dart said stiffly. “He is 
receiving additional instructions 
from home. I wonder if we could 
delay the start of the meeting brief- 
ly?” 

“Of course,” French said. He 
pointed to his right where coffee, 
whiskey, and tiny pastries shaped 
like human thumbs were laid out 
over immaculately white cloths on 
tables between slender columns. 
Servants stood waiting. “We can 
refresh ourselves while we wait. 
The Chief Negotiator has also been 
detained. ’ ’ 

French moved toward the coffee, 
eyes on Dart. 

“I understand that you have ex- 
tensive experience in structures,” 
French said. He bent down and 
worked the silver handle of the cof- 
fee urn. Coffee steamed darkly into 
his cup. “You were first secretary 
here, I understand.” 

“Yes,” Dart answered absently. 
He peered toward the Entrance over 
his shoulder. At that point Bono 
appeared at the door. He blinked in 
the brilliance of tne room. 

“Excuse me,” Dart said, tight 
lipped. “I see that he has just 
caught up with us.” 

French nodded. He took a sip of 
coffee, following Dart with his 
eyes. 

Dart stopped in front of Bono, a 
small little figure before the taller 
tribesman whose forked beard and 
hollow eyes gave a forbidding im- 
age at the moment. Even from a 
distance, French saw that Bono 
hadn’t slept much, if at all. His fea- 
tures showed strain. He didn’t have 



GALAXY 




the languid air of a man who’d 
spent his night striving. 

Dart’s hands gestured fiercely as 
he spoke. Bono looked past Dart 
with an indifferent expression in his 
eyes, observing the tribesmen "who 
placed ornately worked leather fol- 
ders before each seat on the Eco- 
freak side of the table, pre-marked 
with name plates. 

Then Bono glanced at Dart and 
said a single word. A harsh gesture 
of dismissal followed. Bono stepped 
past Dart and walked toward the ta- 
ble. 

French caught the eye of a Union 
negotiator, held an index finger into 
the air, and nodded. The man 
stepped to a tel-set and punched 
numbers. The call would summon 
Proctor. 

Following Bono’s lead, the 
tribesmen settled around the table. 
Ecofreak would obviously shun the 
preliminary talk and drinking that, 
based on experience with this tribe, 
was a prerequisite for sensible 
negotiations. If the tribesmen 
wouldn’t come to the refreshments, 
the refreshments would have to go to 
the tribesmen. 

French beckoned to a servant. 
“Please serve these things at the ta- 
ble,” he said. Then he went to his 
own spot, next to Proctor’s in the 
center, opposite from Franco Dart. 

Bono reached for the carafe of 
whiskey and poured himself a 
glassfull. The liquor tasted sharp, 
warm. He hoped that the intensity 
of his excitement was not evident to 
the others. 

He experienced a kind of breath- 
less intoxication, a kind of careless 
abandon a man felt only in the 
hunt, leaping, say, from boulder to 

HELIUM 



boulder in the mountains after a 
wounded goat, without time for re- 
flection, at the mercy of reflex. 

He poured himself another glass 
and sensed Dart’s disapproving stir. 

Down the hatch! God — some 
breakfast. 

I'm free. I’m loose, Bono 
thought. He kept his face rigid and 
his lips in a kind of pout, but he 
was amused, he wanted to laugh. 

I’m awake, he told himself. 

Tack was far away and plotted 
some kind of nonsensieal war, like 
a child with lead soldiers, yes. 
Bono had bought all that like an in- 
nocent, but now he was awakened, 
finally. Here he was, on the scene, 
plotting love, by Jesus. Ain’t it sim- 
ply wild how one could just chuck 
all those years of habit and go right 
against the grain of the past and 
never give a shit? 

Men rose around him. He looked 
up and saw that Proctor had en- 
tered. He rose also, keeping himself 
in control despite internal bub- 
blings. 

Proctor approached the table, 
blue robes swishing. He carried fol- 
ders under his arms. His chin was 
out. He took up a position across 
from Bono, bowed. Bono returned 
the bow. 

Proctor waited until the assembly 
had settled down. Then he opened a 
folder and began to read the wel- 
coming remarks in a hurried 
monotone. 

Bono sat entranced by an internal 
vision of Jonny Tack. The vision 
amused him in a perverse sort of 
way. He saw Tack kicking furni- 
ture, saw him hit out with a balled 
fist. Perfidy, he’d bellow. Treason! 
And what if Union yields the parts 

61 




anyway? Wouldn’t that be doubly 
amusing? 

To act, to leap out over a chasm 
certain that angels stood beneath to 
catch you on their wings — it had a 
mind-blowing exhilaration. 

Bono followed the vision. If 
Union failed to yield up the parts, 
he would be a fugitive hunted by 
Tack’s agents all over Hinterland. 
He wouldn’t be safe anywhere ex- 
cept in the radiation belts or high up 
in the icy wastes of Canada. 

No matter. He would wander 
forever. .perhaps with Her. One 
act of defiance after all these years 
would be worth it all. 

Proctor’s voice rose slightly, re- 
vealing that he neared the end. 
Bono began to pay attention. 

“And so, gentlemen,’’ Proctor 
wound up, as we look forward 
again to another five years of con- 
structive cooperation with the great 
and nobel tribe of Ecofreak — whose 
purposes, ideals, and aspirations all 
of us in Union deeply share — I wel- 
come you again around this table 
where, though disagreements might 
surface and conflicts may erupt, we 
have always, in the end, signed an 
accord of mutual benefit.’’ 

Hands clapped politely. 

Bono rose, a little giddy. 

“Gentlemen of Union, Chief 
Negotiator, men of Ecofreak. .’’ 

To his left Dart gestured with 
some vehemence. He looked down 
and saw a folder in Dart’s hands ex- 
tended toward him. It was the offi- 
cial opening statement. Its every 
word had been carefully weighed; 
every intonation and nuance had 
been honed in day-long confer- 
ences. Bono waved the folder away. 

“I’m a simple man,’’ he said, rei- 

62 



ly believing that at the moment, 
looking at Proctor, French, and 
sweeping the line of yellow-robed 
BTA officials. They all saw him 
gesture the folder away, and stared 
at him now with new interest. 

“I’m a simple man from the 
steppes of Texahoma. I’ve never 
been inside a structure before. I was 
prepared, like all of my country- 
men, to bring to you suspicion and 
traditional hatred. And is it any 
wonder? We are worlds apart. You 
live on the coasts in these gigantic 
machines under the drumbeat of 
gravitron. .while we farm the land 
and herd our cattle through endless 
oceans of rolling mutagrass. ...” 

A strong emotion helped him 
speak. Words rolled off his tongue 
unasked. He saw an exchange of 
glances between French and Proc- 
tor. He heard a sound from his left 
where Dart seemed to be gagging 
on something. 

“For too long a time, too many 
years, your missiles have threatened 
our settlements. But weWe had your 
life in our hands. Ever since the 
Helium War of 1011, when we 
forced your corporations to give up 
control by guerilla warfare, we’ve 
had our hand on the Helium valve. 
And so we stare at each other 
across the Desolation that circles 
you and keeps us apart.” 

The tribesmen to either side 
stirred in discomfort. 

“There is much beauty here,” 
Bono continued with a sweep of his 
hand, indicating the blaze of lights 
in the room. But he saw in mind’s 
eye the beauty that was Regina, her 
face inclined over his, as they 
had talked on a low divan all 
through the night. “There is beauty 

GALAXY 




here and art, and great skill,” he 
continued. “Structure-man has 
made the High Culture, and may it 
live forever. May we all, our scien- 
tists and yours, together seek an al- 
ternative to gravitron, an alternative 
that doesn’t kill as it lifts.” 

Dart coughed. The old man 
seemed to die of coughing — a 
harsh, distracting sound. 

Bono went on. The words came 
of their own accord. He was high 
on fatigue. He realized vaguely 
that he spoke to Regina, to himself, 
not to this assembly. 

“But Hinterland mustn’t be de- 
spised. We have our life as you 
have yours. The land belongs to us. 
Our eyes look out over the steppes. 
We walk the high sierras, we sail 
the lakes and rivers. We give you 
what you need to live and in ex- 
change you give us the products we 
don’t want to make for ourselves. 
Ours is a life of mutual dependence. 
Why then do we threaten each 
other? We have Helium and you 
have the technology we need — to 
communicate, to increase our com- 
forts. Is there sense in constant ten- 
sion?” 

He looked around the assembly, 
lifting his eyes from the empty 
whiskey glass to which he had been 
addressing himself. 

“There is not,” he affirmed. 
“We have everything to gain, noth- 
ing to lose from maximum coop- 
eration. Let us strive together. .” 
The word made him halt for a split 
second. “. .for the best possible 
deal we can find, in a spirit of love 
and mutual respect. ’ ’ 

He sat down amidst uncertain 
applause. 

Dart’s face was immediately at 

HELIUM 



his ear. The sour old-man’s breath 
hissed. 

“Have you gone mad? Why 
didn’t you use the prepared text?” 

A BTA man rose, cleared his 
throat, and began to read the 1051 
Helium Contract. 

Bono turned to Dart. “I didn’t 
say anything that wasn’t in the text, 
more or less. Just different words. 
My own.” He saw that Dart was 
frightened. 

“Mycal, there’s a world of dif- 
ference. For God’s sake, don’t go 
on like this. You’re endangering our 
lives. Yours and mine. Jonny will 
be furious.” 

Bono shrugged. “He doesn’t 
need to know. If we get him the 
silco-parts, he’ll be delighted. He 
doesn’t have to know how we con- 
duct the negotiations.” 

Dart was breathless. It seemed to 
him that Bono’s eyes still had a 
glimmer of madness, a residue of 
the night before. He reached for the 
prepared text bound in a folder, 
opened it, and flipped to the last 
page. He pointed to Jonny ’s initials 
in the approval box in the corner. 

“He approved it,” Dart whis- 
pered. Although Dart’s voice was 
low, Bono could sense the heavy 
charge of emotion in the words. 
“He put his initials on this. That’s 
tantamount to an order.” Dart hit 
the expensive fiber paper with a 
wrinkled knuckle. 

“We need flexibility to 
negotiate,” Bono returned curtly. 
“I’m no tape recorder, parroting his 
words.” 

The BTA official droned away, 
reading the contract. 

“The cable,” Dart insisted in a 
whisper, meaning the random- 



63 




coding radio communications sys- 
tem that linked the embassy with 
the Texahoma camp but which, as a 
result of tradition, still went by the 
term ‘cable.’ “If you want a change 
in direction, you can cable home. 
But without his approval, you can’t 
deviate from your instructions. 
Jonny will string us up. I can’t let 
you do it, Mycal. Withdraw your 
statement now and read this.” 

Bono fixed Dart with a stare. 
“You’re merely an advisor. You 
can’t tell me how to negotiate.” 

Dart remembered that he had the 
courage to oppose. “Do you know 
why I’m on this delegation?” he 
asked in an angry whisper, recalling 
Jonny’s words again — “Go with 
him, keep your eyes on him.” “I’m 
here,” he went on, “because I op- 
posed your nomination. And Jonny 
sent me along to keep an eye on 
you. And it’s a good thing he did. 
You gave them an altogether false 
impression with your off-the-cuff 
ramblings.” 

Dart felt redeemed by Bono’s 
blunder. I might have blabbed a lit- 
tle to Barney, he thought, but I 
didn’t disobey any direct orders 
from Jonny Tack. He wondered 
where Bono had spent his night and 
suspected that he knew only too 
well. Of such liaisons came bad 
policy. Bono’s incoherent babble, 
the mad look in his eyes, his rum- 
pled clothes convinced Dart that 
more trouble lay ahead. Union 
bureaucrats had a phrase that de- 
scribed what he now felt about the 
chief of mission. Bono had blood 
on him. Any moment now the 
hounds could close in. Dart had 
known it, had known it from the 
start, had told Tack as much in no 

64 



uncertain terms. Dart didn’t mince 
words when he opposed. And if the 
hounds already bayed in the dis- 
tance, Dart wished to be far away 
when they arrived. 

“You’ve heard the old accord. 
Chief Bono,” Proctor said. “What 
is your initial position for the next 
round?’ ’ 

French eyed Bono with interest. 
The tribesman’s opening remarks, 
clearly invented on the spot, had 
had a very different sound than 
Bono’s initial observations in the 
hall of reception. Now the Ecofreak 
chief, who had lowered his eyes 
toward a leather folder, looked up 
at Proctor. His face revealed noth- 
ing. 

“Ecofreak has no initial posi- 
tion,” Bono stressed. “Ecofreak 
has one position. We intend to 
abide by it. I believe it’s fair and 
reasonable and will benefit both 
sides. With your permission. I’ll 
read it.” 

Proctor nodded. 

They’d have certainty, at last, 
French thought. If they had been 
deceived in their estimates, now 
they’d know the truth — or at least 
as much of the truth as Bono would 
reveal in his opening sally. French 
found it significant that Barney had 
been excluded from the delegation. 
He hoped with all his heart that 
Bono’s statement had been mere 
talk, rhethoric, not the exposition of 
an Accommodationist view. 

Men opened folders. French 
looked down at his own sheet. He 
held a stylus at the ready. 

Bono began to read, very slowly. 

French made a checkmark next to 
item one. The plastosteel demand, 
as Barney had told him — and as 



GALAXY 




French had noted on the fiber nap- 
kin with the imprint of The Mutant 
in the comer — was eight hundred 
thousand tons. No surprise there. 
Bono read sixteen conditions that 
dealt with delivery. BTA men re- 
corded the points. So did six 
cameras through holes in the ceil- 
ing. 

Next came a list of products. 
French grew more alert. The item 
slipped by almost without notice. 
Five thousand clock movements, 
three helicopters, fifty thousand 
switches, eight hundred visisets, 
ninety thousand lectroshavers of 
brand BRASOMAT, five hundred 
thousand sheets of scriptoplast. 

The list went on and on. 

The last item on the BTA predic- 
tion was the hostage demand. It 
said: ‘Hostage: Sidney Unsler, Un- 
derunifier (expected to yield on this 
point if 33% of plastosteel demand 
is met).” 

French felt his muscles tense as 
Bonos voice rose. The chief was 
almost finished. French glanced at 
Proctor, but the man’s face was im- 
passive, the thick neck solid; the 
huge chin stuck out as if daring the 
world to hit it. 

‘‘And finally,” he heard Bono 
say, ‘‘the hostage demand.” 

In that moment of intense wait- 
ing, French recalled wryly the ori- 
gin of hostage demands — they went 
back to ancient days, the troubled 
era of the LNW’s, when the taking 
of hostages for political purposes 
had been a random and unpredicta- 
ble phenomenon until, in this era, it 
had become institutionalized. It was 
symbolic, nothing more. Yet now, 
how much emotion stirred in French 
as he waited! 



Bono had laid aside his folder. 
His eyes were looking straight at 
Proctor. 

“This round we shall require 
only a single hostage,” Bono said. 
“However, by reason of the unre- 
mitting threat that Union missiles 
represent, we shall demand unusual 
proof of your good intentions. 

Bono paused. He reached for the 
carafe of whiskey and poured him- 
self a tiny glass of the clear liquid. 
French watched him tilt it back. 
Dart appeared upset by this small 
interruption in the proceedings. His 
deep-set eyes stared at Bono in an 
expression of tight-lipped disap- 
proval. 

Bono held the glass in his hand. 
“This round,” he said, and French 
detected a slight trembling in the 
voice, “we demand that you make 
available as hostage Regina Unsler, 
the Unifier’s daughter.” 

Silence. 

Bono lifted his little glass, tilted 
it back. He shook it, as if to extract 
a tiny drop of whiskey at the bot- 
tom. 

“And furthermore,” a stunned 
French heard him say, “it is our 
demand that you make this known 
to the public of Union immediately 
by a special visicast.” 

Silence. 

French had predicted most of the 
negotiating points — save one. That 
one deviation spoiled it all. He re- 
membered an image he particularly 
liked. Each Helium round was a 
knife-fight in the dark on wet and 
muddy ground. At the moment, in a 
kind of slow motion. Union’s feet 
were slipping on the mud. Slowly 
they came off the ground. Slowly 
Union fell toward the ground while 

65 



HELIUM 




the opponent, equally slowly, came 
in with a flash of light caught in the 
metal of the blade. 

French controlled his astonishment 
and looked about. 

Bono filled his glass with whis- 
key. Two tribesmen at the far end 
of the table whispered, heads close. 
Most of the rest stared gloomily at 
folders, hands. 

Then Dart suddenly rose from his 
chair. The short, wrinkled man 
turned from the table and on wob- 
bly, curved legs he hurried toward 
the door. 

Proctor appeared to be frozen. 
French glanced at him anxiously. 
Proctor stared at the list before him, 
chin down, as if it had been hit 
with a sledge hammer. 

“Your demands. Chief Bono,” 
Proctor said, looking up at last, are 
unprecedented, to say the least. I 
propose that we reconvene here to- 
morrow morning, at which time we 
shall give you our initial reaction.” 

Proctor moved back his chair. 

French leaned over, whispered; 
“The specs. We’ve got to Jiave a 
look at the drawings. Ask for 
documentation. Res.” 

Proctor shrugged. With a sinking 
heart French saw the man’s intense 
disappointment, although Proctor 
hid it well. 

“Details,” Proctor whispered 
tiredly. “Details. We’ve been stabbed 
in the back.” 

“Please,” French pleaded. “We 
must have the drawings.” 

From across the table, they both 
heard Bono speak. “Mr. Proctor, I 
can agree to your proposal that we 
adjourn. On one condition. The hos- 
tage demand must appear on Media 
today.” 

66 



Proctor had himself under excel- 
lent control. French knew the way 
Proctor must feel. Everything about 
the session had Accommodation 
writ lirge about it — front, back, 
sides, top, and bottom. French 
skirted a suicidal thought — his esti- 
mates could have been wrong. But 
now, it merely seemed so. Seemed 
but wasn’t! He simply couldn’t im- 
agine that he and his staff should 
have blundered so badly. The evi- 
dence before French now must have 
another explanation. 

Proctor spoke. “Your demand is 
most unreasonable. At this point, 
traditionally, we analyze your de- 
mands. For that we need both time 
and complete documentation. We 
have no problems, in principle, with 
your hostage demand. But we ex- 
pect to negotiate a package in se- 
crecy before we go to Media.” 

Across the table Bono tried to 
control the shaking of his hands. 
His hands were sweaty. They left 
moist marks on the folder before 
him. Until now he had always dis- 
missed Dart as merely tiresome, but 
now the little rat had shown unusual 
initiative — walking out of the 
negotiations! What had possessed 
him? Bono had a vision of Dart dic- 
tating a communique for transmis- 
sion to Tack. But that was unthink- 
able. Dart was a coward at heart. 
Even so, Bono had to get them to 
announce the hostage demand. At 
once. He had no time to lose. She’d 
see him tonight. She’d see him the 
moment Media made its report. 

“We have the documentary pack- 
age for you,” Bono said. He ges- 
tured to Sonder. The burly tribes- 
man passed a large roll of drawings 
and a thick book of specs across the 

GALAXY 




table to his technical counterpart 
from BTA, Clemmens, a balding, 
older man. “As for the announce- 
ment, it is the minimum require- 
ment for another meeting.” 

• Bono rose from his chair and ges- 
tured to the tribal delegation. All 
rose and bowed. 



ULTIMATUM 

She came up out of groggy sleep, 
angrily resisting. Something pulled 
incessantly on her arm. 

Her dream had been a mass of 
confusion, anxiety, and fear. She 
had tumbled in the air through 
clouds. Sidney had chased her in a 
tube, his finger pointing. Someone 
had bured her beneath a mountain. 
No, it had been a grave. Dead? Dy- 
ing? And Mycal had glowered 
above her with a spade in his hand. 
Earth had tumbled on her. .or had 
it been grass? 

She tried to turn away from the 
insistent, nagging pull. But the pull- 
ing persisted. She heard Selma’s 
voice? “Miss Ginny, mistress.” 

Regina opened her eyes and saw 
Selma’s face. Beyond the girl was 
the intricate pink silk construction 
of the bed’s roof and sides. 

“What is it? What time is it?” 
Regina mumbled. She felt as if she 
hadn’t slept at all. It seemed only 
moments ago that she had lifted 
Mycal’s head gently from her lap. 
She’d been bone weary. She had 
left him asleep on the divan where 
they had talked endlessly through 
the night. She had left him and had 
gone to curl up on her own bed. 
And now this person.

tel,” this person said with a hunted, 
harried look in the eyes. “He insists 
that I wake you. He’s been call- 
ing for over an hour, every five 
minutes.” 

Regina shook her head and blink- 
ed. There was a pain behind her 
temples. 

“Who?” she asked. “Who in- 
sists?’ ’ 

“It’s him,” Selma said. Her fa- 
cial expression and intonation said 
the rest. 

' “Tell him to drop dead,” Regina 
said and turned her head back into 
the pillows. 

Once more she felt the tug on her 
arm. Selma’s voice had an edge of 
panic. 

“Miss Ginny, please, he 
threatens. .” 

Regina sat up. Eyes flashing, she 
cried: “All right, all right. I’ll talk 
to him.” 

She leaped out of the bed and 
strode off into the sitting room out- 
side her sleeping chamber. Fury 
boiled in her. She threw herself into 
a chair and activated the small- 
screened tel. 

“What do you want,” she said, 
staring at the screen. The image of 
her brother didn’t appear. All too 
often he turned down the visio. He 
liked to come into her room as a 
disembodied voice. She reached 
forward and turned down the visio 
on her side too, just as his voice 
came over the box. 

“How was it?” 

“How was what?” 

“Striving with that bumpkin.” 

“You’re disgusting,” she said; 
her voice conveyed revulsion. She 
wanted to cut him off, to take the 
tel and fling it against the wall. But 

68 



she didn’t dare. 

“Ho, ho, ho! Look who’s calling 
who names. I was told all about 
you, femmy. As for disgust- 
ing. .you threw yourself at him. 
Well, let me tell you something, 
Ginny. I won’t have it, under- 
stand?” 

She heard the sharpness of his 
voice and could well imagine, with- 
out any help from the screen, the 
tight, angry look on his long face, 
the cruel turn of his lips. 

She should have known that her 
all-night dancing would be reported 
to Sidney. She had put him — and 
Clafto — out of her mind. But Clafto 
had tried to dance with her several 
times during the ball. She had re- 
fused him each and every time. At 
the end he had glowered with dark 
fury. Now she reaped the conse- 
quences. 

She didn’t answer. She wondered 
what he might say next. She was 
afraid, but for once she felt defiant 
as well. By tonight Media would 
broadcast the news. Her father 
would hear of that and know that 
Accommodation was possible again, 
that Ecofreak sought her. They’d 
call her into his presence. She 
would be safe again and forever 
more, safely tucked away in Hinter- 
land. But for the moment she was 
fearful and wary. She didn’t dare 
give Sidney any hints. 

“Well?” he said. “You heard 
me.” 

“I heard you.” 

“And. ?” 

“And what?” 

“And what’re you going to do?” 

“What do you want me to do?” 

“You know what it is. I don’t 
have to tell you.” 



GALAXY 




She knew. He considered her a 
plaything for his favorites. Clafto 
was Sidney’s latest favorite. He 
stood next in line as Underunifier 
should Daddy suddenly die. Until 
Sidney changed his mind, of 
course. Then it would be someone 
else. And after, that it would be 
someone else again. And in Sid- 
ney’s mind, whoever it was must be 
her lover, her husband if Daddy 
ever died. 

She imagined the future as a 
succession of husbands, one after 
the other. Each one would be 
executed when he fell from favor. 
Today Sidney couldn’t kill them. 
But in the future he would, he 
would. For a moment she felt des- 
perate. Then she remembered. This 
time she would escape. Serenita had 
known it, and somewhere deeply 
she also knew, despite that horrid 
dream which even now lay beneath 
her consciousness like some pres- 
sure. 

“I’m still thinking about it.’’ 

“Damn you, bitch,’’ he hissed 
over the tel. “Weeks ago — weeks 
ago I told you to take Clafto! 
Thought it had happened. And this 
morning he told me how it really is. 
You deceived me, Ginny. You 
shouldn’t do that, you know. And 
last night you made a whore of 
yourself — with a tribesman! 

“I did no such thing,’’ she 
answered quietly. She wished she 
had. 

“He spent the night.” 

“We talked.” 

“I bet,” he cried with a little 
laugh. “I bet you did! Well, my 
sweet, there’s an end to that, as of 
now. Clafto will come to you to- 
night, and you’d better receive him. 

HELIUM 



If you don’t. I’ll personally open 
the doors for him. And for his 
friends. Tell that to your staff, 
chippie.” 

Regina shivered. She wouldn’t be 
here. She’d go and hide some- 
where. He wouldn’t dare\ 

“I’ll go to Daddy,” she cried. “I 
can’t stand it any more!” 

“Ohhh? You will, will you? 
Good luck, fem-stuff, good luck to 
you. And if you get through to him, 
tell him that, that. .” 

He can’t think of a threat terrible 
enough, she thought. 

“Let me tell you this, Ginny. 
You go to Daddy, and I’ll make 
sure that you regret it to the end of 
your days.” 

Sister Serenita, she thought. I’ll 
go to St. Theresas of Carmen. 

“And don’t think you can escape 
me, Ginny. My men are stationed at 
all your doors. You can’t get away. 
Don’t try.” 

Hysteria put clammy claws 
around her throat. She buried her 
face in her hands. Her mind raced, 
seeking alternative routes of escape. 
She couldn’t find any. 

Maybe I’ll have to yield to Claf- 
to. Sidney will have his way with 
me one final time. Then I’ll get 
away forever. 

It wasn’t the physical thing she 
hated; that she rather liked — it was 
the humiliation of it all. Another 
man’s will imposed on her. And 
now, with that strangely sweet ex- 
perience behind her, her memories 
filled with the long talk she’d had 
with the archangel, trying to assure 
him that she truly loved him — 
although she didn’t; and this morn- 
ing she knew that — it seemed to her 
terrible and repulsive to yield to 

69 




Clafto merely because her brother 
commanded it. Mycal had given her 
a feeling of what it might be like 
again. .true love. She could yield 
to him, although she didn’t love 
him and meant to use him 
crassly — like Sidney tried to use 
her. 

But I’m in desperate straits, she 
thought. He’ U forgive me. 

“Well?” the voice over the tel 
probed. “What do you say?” 

“Nothing,” she answered. ‘‘I 
have nothing more to say to you, 
Sidney.” 

She reached forward and cut him 
off. 

Immediately, she punched out the 
numbers of her father’s office; she 
kept the visio off. In her fluffy 
nightgown, her hair in disarray, her 
face puffy from sleep and kisses, 
she didn’t want to be seen. 

“Top Level,” the switchboard 
operator sang, and a woman’s face 
appeared in the screen. 

Regina identified herself and 
asked to be connected with her 
father. 

“We’ll switch you,” the woman 
said. Her voice was cool. The 
screen went blank. 

Regina waited. The seconds mul- 
tiplied into a minute, then another. 
Too late, she thought. He must have 
gotten through before I did. His 
people are everywhere. Her spirits 
sank. She saw in her mind the cor- 
ridors, the large offices filled with 
her father’s many aides. A wall 
about him. He was behind them, re- 
mote and inaccessible even to his 
own flesh and blood. 

After a minute, another face ap- 
peared. She recognized Blotting- 
ham. Daddy’s chief of staff — and 

70 



one of Sidney’s friends as well. 

He said: “Miss Unsler? Am I 
speaking to Miss Unsler?” He ran 
a hand over the short hair on top of 
his head, cut into the shape of an 
egg. “Your visio is off.” 

“This is Regina.” 

“The Unifier will return your call 
as soon as he is out of conference.” 
His tone was crisp but cool, and 
Regina knew that she had failed. 

V 

THE RANDOM OSCILLATION 
EFFECT 

French came out of Proctor’s of- 
fice and rushed past an astonished 
Mrs. Sedlig toward the elevators. 
His energetic strides translated 
anger into kinetic energy. 

Mrs. Sedlig peered after him, her 
head slightly bent, above thick rim- 
less lenses that she wore on her 
nose for reading. 

She was a small, faded person, 
with grey hair held in a bun at the 
back, and red-rimmed, almost lash- 
less eyes. Her fussy fingers ner- 
vously checking packages for signa- 
ture were as much a part of BTA’s 
atmosphere as Proctor himself. She 
had been his inseparable companion 
since the days of Defense, and 
though she didn’t look it, she was a 
survivor type, having come through 
the clerical purges when secretary 
machines had invaded the bureauc- 
racy and only a very few, the most 
loyal, the ‘indispensables,’ had re- 
mained in such positions. Like 
Proctor she lived alone and had 
never married or entered a contract. 
She drew her total psychic suste- 
nance from her work, and this 
room — with its scatter of comforta- 



GALAXY 




ble couches and little coffee tables, 
the holographs of Helium refineries 
on the wall, the tribal flags in 
stands, the huge potted artificial 
plants she tended as if they were 
real — was her real domain. From 
her teak desk next to Proctor’s door 
she guarded his privacy, filtered the 
messages, and watched the rise and 
fall of issues and of men. 

Now, as she watched French dis- 
appear down the hall, striding angri- 
ly, his purple robe swinging, she 
had a clear intuition that Rivera 
French was on the way down. She 
inferred this from a number of little 
signals, not just from the shouting 
match in Proctor’s office which she 
had overheard as a dampened se- 
quence of sound through the wall. She 
gathered it also from the frequency 
with which Gregory Korn, the DA 
for Compliance, was called to Proc- 
tor’s office — he being French’s 
chief rival — and Proctor’s own mut- 
terings when she took him coffee or 
emptied his in-box. She stored the 
information away in her meticu- 
lously ordered memory, thinking that 
French was altogether a vulgar man, 
much too impulsive, his Branco 
heritage worn outside for all to see. 
Then she returned her attention to a 
thick decision package. 

Down the hall French had stopped 
in front of the elevators and 
waited, fuming. His breath still 
steamed with hormones generated 
by the bitter exchange. 

The post-mortem of the negotiat- 
ing session had left a foul taste in 
his mouth. Proctor had gathered his 
chief aides for an emergency meet- 
ing. His strategy had soon 
emerged — a replay of the laser issue 
of five years ago. Proctor had pro- 

HELIUM 



posed that the silco-parts be offered 
to Ecofreak in exchange for a with- 
drawal of the hostage demand — 
and, of course, delivery of a 
Helium Interdiction. ‘ ‘We have noth- 
ing to lose by trying,” he had 
said, “and, frankly, we have noth- 
ing left to try.” 

French punched the elevator but- 
ton again with unnecessary force. 

He’d known it, had felt it in his 
guts, cduld have predicted this 
would happen, had guessed it would 
happen ever since that evening at 
the jump ball game just before that 
fatal encounter with Meyer’s sparks. 

In the office he had argued with 
something approaching fury that the 
Secret Agenda had to be achieved 
some other way. The sil- 
components couldn’t be delivered. 
A brief glimpse at the Ecofreak 
drawings before the meeting had 
convinced him that the parts had 
some sort of military significance. 
But Proctor had shrugged that off. 
He could be ruthlessly singleminded 
when it came to his own objectives. 
At last French had walked out in 
anger, leaving the field to more 
compliant deputy assistants. He, for 
one, wouldn’t risk Union’s 
millions — not even to remove the 
Unslers ffom rule. 

But you shouldn’t have said it, he 
thought. You should have kept your 
yap shut. 

Opposing the Chief Negotiator 
did nothing for a man’s career — 
least of all if Proctor turned out to 
be right in the end and became Uni- 
fier. But there was a point where 
ambition had to be subordinated to 
responsibility. 

The elevator doors slid aside. 
French was about to enter when he 



71 




saw Darby Dickens come out. He 
stopped the DA for security. 

“Darby,” he said, “in all this 
turmoil I haven’t had a chance to 
talk to you. Did Franklin tell you 
about my situation?” 

Dickens nodded gravely. He was 
a tall, black Structure Panther whose 
exemplary neatness never failed 
to surprise French. After a night’s 
work, his jump suit was completely 
free of wrinkles. His sleeves were 
carefully rolled back to his elbows. 
His olive arms were thick and solid. 
A golden watch gleamed on his 
wrist. 

“We’ll rescue Miri, never fear,” 
Dickens said. “That’ll be the first 
sweep tonight. But it’ll be late. We 
must wait until the crowds thin 
out.” 

“I want to go along,” French 
said. 

Dickens nodded. “Have my boys 
issue you a chemgun and mask and 
meet us in the stadium at half past 
ten or so. Gomer will be in charge 
of that sector. Look him up.” 
“Thanks,” French said. “By the 
way. Darby, what is this all about. 
Operation Hairy Scary?” 

A grin lit up Dickens’ face. 
“You don’t know?” 

French shook his head. “I 
haven’t had a chance to ask Proctor. ’ ’ 
“Well, let it be a surprise, then. 
I’m sorry, Riv, I don’t have time to 
explain. I’m on my way to Res 
now. Hairy Scary is turning out to 
he one of his pets — if you know 
what I mean.” 

“Darby—” 

“Later.” Dickens moved off, 
waving. 

French punched the elevator but- 
ton again. Darby enjoyed all this. 

72 



Nothing like an operation to break 
the routine of guarding doors and 
grav-drums. But if Proctor planned 
something foolish, would Dickens 
restrain him? 

It came out of the man rarely 
enough, thank God, French re- 
flected, thinking about Proctor’s 
penchant for practical jokes. But 
when it came out, it was usually 
something approaching the sordid. 
It seemed as if practical joking and 
perpetual bachelorhood went hand 
in hand. French recalled ‘Operation 
Sulphy Ovum’ when a hundred 
crates of rotten eggs had been deli- 
vered to Top Level three years ago. 
Proctor had been most indignant, 
had promised a full investigation 
when Blottingham had come calling 
in the wake of the stink. Yet 
everyone suspected that Proctor 
himself had planned every detail of 
that. 

The elevator came and French got 
in. For a second he surveyed men- 
tally the many hours between now 
and half past ten. Miri would be in 
that small room, waiting. A power- 
ful pulse of longing shook him, and 
he realized he didn’t give a damn 
about silco-parts, Ecofreak, Proctor, 
or anything else — not until Miri was 
safe. 

As he strode off toward his office 
two floors down, he made a mental 
note to call Dachshund Jones, 
Number One in the Kayring Gang. 
He would hand Miri over to the 
gang for safekeeping. Nothing less 
would give him mental rest. 

People filled his office. The 
lights had been turned off. Schema- 
tics of an ear-shaped device intri- 
cately overlaid by a strange pattern 
were projected against a wall. A 

GALAXY 




computer console stood on the 
right. A three-dimensional articula- 
tion of the component turned slowly 
in the upper half of the screen while 
an odd, random, zig-zag curve 
flashed like lightning on the bottom. 

Clemmens had assembled the 
technical staff for an examination of 
the sil-components. Two sil- 
chemists from Norleans had stayed 
to help. But why in this office? 
Then French realized the reason. 
Operation Hairy-Scary had pre- 
empted all the conference rooms. 

French stepped in wondering if 
Professor Fulbright of the Central 
Technical Institute had arrived. 

French said: “How are we com- 
ing? Anything new?” 

Dark, shadowed faces turned to- 
ward him. Clemmens stood next to 
the computer screen with a pointer 
in his hand. He turned to French. 

“We’ve stumbled onto something 
new, Riv. Should’ve thought of it 
long ago. .but we’re industrial 
technologists. This is a rather ad- 
vanced research notion. Lindy here 
suggested that Ecofreak might be 
using the ROE. That’s a long shot, 
of course, but we haven’t got any- 
thing to lose. We’re boxed 
in. .Professr Fulbright is here.” 

French took the cue. He searched 
the blue-white faces until his eyes 
found a small man with angry eyes 
and a sparse goatee. He walked 
over to Fulbright and shook his 
hand. 

“How do you do, professor; glad 
you could come.” 

He turned back to Clemmens at 
the screen. 

The Random Oscillation Effect. 
Curious. Over the years French had 
read articles about the ROE in the 



scientific press. Great promise, little 
performance. 

“Well, Clemmens, what have 
you decided. What use could they 
make of the effect?” 

Clemmens shrugged. Computer 
lights were reflected in his bald 
skull. “We haven’t the faintest, 
Riv. It’s a useless phenomenon — 
useless precisely because it’s ran- 
dom. A laboratory curiosity. But 
suppose this little gadget controls 
the oscillations. ...” 

Clemmens let that one sink in. 

French thought for a second. 
“Atomics?” he said. God, he 
thought, if it’s really so, Proctor 
has to be stopped! 

Heads nodded around the table. 

Clemmens said: “If this little 
switch can modulate .the oscilla- 
tions, Ecofreak could neutralize an 
atomic attack. But how?” Clem- 
mens raised his hands. “We can’t 
figure it out. This isn’t the whole 
assembly — only the part they can’t 
make themselves. And from this lit- 
tle bone — ” Clemmens tapped the 
console screen with his pointer and 
tiny dots of white appeared on the 
blue surface where he tapped. “ — 
we can’t reconstruct the whole 
beast. ... At least not in an after- 
noon.” 

French looked down at the pro- 
fessor. 

“What’s your assessment. Dr. 
Fulbright?” 

The physicist snorted. He had a 
high, crackly voice. “It won’t 
work,” he pronounced. “I’ve told 
your staff as much, Mr. French, but 
they persist. I’ve spent thirty years 
of my life trying to control the ROE 
and haven’t done it yet. I find it a 
little difficult to imagine that simple 



HELIUM 



73 




tribal engineers should have solved 
the puzzle.” 

The man’s offended ego sent out 
angry vibrations. French didn’t say 
what he had on his mind. Those 
‘simple tribal engineers’ had proven 
their mettle in field after field. The 
Crestmore bible thundered against 
Technology, but Hinterland was 
filled with heretics, as it were. He 
recalled a fancy laboratory he had 
once nearly penetrated on the out- 
skirts of Kaysee in Mokan 
territory — clumps of buildings in a 
rolling valley beside the remnants of 
an ancient highway. French had 
seen white-clad technicians moving 
about beyond a fence like monas- 
tics. Roofs had bristled with anten- 
nae. He had found odd chemicals in 
the waste cans of that lab. That had 
been one of those missions to fol- 
low up on the laser demand, a job 
he hadn’t left to subordinates. 

Clemmens cleared his throat. 
French sensed a tension in the 
room. 

‘‘You will admit, won’t you. 
Professor Fulbright, that you’ve 
never tried to weld copper and SP.” 

‘‘I’ll admit no such thing!” Ful- 
bright bristled. ‘‘I have avoided 
meaningless experiments, if that’s 
what you mean. But my students 
and I have simulated all possible 
combinations of sil and common 
materials. The mathematical founda- 
tions have been laid. They yield no 
results.” 

French looked back at Clemmens. 

‘‘Suppose for a moment, profes- 
sor, that they use a new kind of 
mathematics.” 

Fulbright snorted. ‘‘Preposterous! 
What new mathematics? There is 
only one kind. Models of the Uni- 

74 



verse, Mr. Clemmens. .perhaps, 
perhaps. But surely you don’t mean 
a new math!” 

Scientists were childish in propor- 
tion to their fame. French knew that 
Fulbright could be of help — ^but it 
would take time. 

‘‘1 meant a model, professor. 
Perhaps a five-dimensional ap- 
proach, that sort of thing. I’m an 
engineer myself and don’t pre- 
tend. ...” 

French had to go. In that bitter 
meeting with Proctor, he had had an 
intuition. Recalling the negotiating 
session, it had seemed to him that 
Bono had acted against tribal in- 
structions. Perhaps the man had fall- 
en for the girl and meant to extract 
her by using the negotiations. Proc- 
tor had rejected that thesis out of 
hand, saying it was incompatible 
with the parallel demand for Media 
announcement of the hostage re- 
quest. Bono could have the girl for 
the asking. She was a notorious 
whore, warming the bed of just 
about anybody who wanted her 
badly enough. Nonsense, nonsense. 
Nevertheless, French was sure. He 
wanted another look at the tapes of 
the ball and of the morning session. 

He waited for Fulbright to finish 
while he eyed Clemmens. The two 
men clearly clashed. French decided 
he had done the right thing in call- 
ing in Fulbright. Answers would 
surely come from these collisions. 

Fulbright was saying: ‘‘1 wel- 
come your inspection of our mod- 
els, Mr. Clemmens. We have a 
goodly set of models. Five dimen- 
sional models, ten dimensional 
models, Mr. Clemmens. Thirty 
years is a long time, you know, and 
I pride myself on a modest reputa- 

GALAXY 




tion in the field of Vibration.” 

Personal gravitron — the Fulbright 
invention everyone knew about — 
had made the professor famous. He 
had discovered a method of sensitiz- 
ing fibers in gravitron chambers so 
that they gave temporary lift to in- 
dividuals. Police used it and so did 
sealing crews. It had made jumpball 
possible — alas. 

French said: “I’ll be back short- 
ly, gentlemen; in the meantime, 
please continue. Professor, thanks 
for your help. We must solve this 
mystery somehow and do it quick- 
ly.” 

He turned and went off toward 
the Psychometry Department of the 
Office of Research. 



THE COURAGE TO OPPOSE 

Dart scurried down the narrow 
stairs with occasional, furtive 
glances over his shoulder. He ap- 
peared unaware of the slightly com- 
ical, almost theatrical image he pro- 
jected as he tiptoed down the car- 
peted stairs, the very picture of 
guilty stealth. He tried to make 
himself small and inconscpicuous, 
althogh there was no one about. 

A nervous litany ran in his head, 
/ hope, I hope, I hope, he repeated. 

Dart hoped that no one would in- 
terrupt his clandestine communica- 
tions with Jonny Tack. He hoped 
that the technician on duty in the 
comroom wouldn’t raise any annoy- 
ing little questions about Dart’s au- 
thority. He hoped, above all, that 
Tack would receive the message 
well. 

In a situation of this kind, where 
a man had to walk a tightrope be- 

HELIUM 



tween two chasms, one couldn’t be 
sure of the outcome. It took a man 
of courage to do what he was about 
to do; no, more than that — a man of 
subtlety. 

He held several sheets of scrip- 
toplast in his hand. He had labored 
long and hard on the precise word- 
ing of the message. Time and again 
he had pushed sheets through the 
renewal slot above the desk in his 
room to erase unsuitable variations. 
Now he had a version he could live 
with. 

He hoped that the words would 
convey the picture just. .so. Not 
too hard on Bono — ^just in case. Not 
too tolerant either — in the 

event. 

At the bottom of the stairs Dart 
stopped to orient himself. He had 
been down here many times in the 
old days, but things had changed. 
The comroom should be to the left. 
Yes, there it was. He saw the sign 
painted on a glass door. He moved 
forward. 

I talked to him, he reassured him- 
self. I asked him outright. This 
shouldn’t come as a surprise to 
him. / said to him: “Mycal,” I 
said, “are you acting on your own 
authority on this? Do you have a 
secret mandate from Jonny Tack?’’ 
I was very direct with the man. I 
came to the point. I didn’t mince 
words. 

Bono’s eyes had shied under 
Dart’s penetrating gaze. Bono had 
scratched his ear, had glowered. 
“My arrangements with Jonny are 
none of your concern. Franco,” 
he’d said. “When I want your ad- 
vice, I’ll ask for it.” 

The memory made Dart feel the 
fury he had felt then. 



75 




There had been more along those 
lines. Bono hadn’t been direct. He 
hadn’t denied, hadn’t affirmed. 

Well, my boy, you can’t blame 
me for drawing my own conclu- 
sions. I hope they’re right. I hope, I 
hope. 

Dart’s entrance into the comroom 
startled a lone technician. The 
youngster lounged in front of a 
large console with many buttons 
and a keyboard. He shoved a book 
into a drawer. 

“You’re certainly busy,” Dart 
snapped, taking advantage of the 
situation. “What’s this you’re read- 
ing? Let me see it?” 

“Yes, sir,” the youngster said, 
swallowing. He opened the drawer 
and held out the book. BTA in Ac- 
tion. It had Proctor on the cover. 

“Uhhum,” Dart said, eyebrows 
raised. “Propaganda. And theirs at 
that. Don’t believe a word of it. 
You men certainly live a cushy life 
around here, don’t you?” He ges- 
tured at numerous pinups on the 
wall. “When I was first secretary 
around here, we ran a tighter ship.” 

The youngster gulped. “Yes, 
sir.” 

“Got an emergency,” Dart said. 
“Get cracking on this message to 
Tack. Priority. Security code one.” 

Dart held out the sheets, and the 
technician went to work. He pulled 
out a book and looked something 
up. From a cabinet with little metal 
drawers opposite the console he 
selected a plastic card, inserted it 
into a slot on the console. Then he 
sat down before the keyboard. 

Dart relaxed. He felt in control. 

“Does this door lock?” He ges- 
tured toward the frosted glass. “I 
don’t want to be interrupted. This is 

76 



a priority one.” He wanted to drive 
that point home. 

“Yes, sir,” the youngster said. 
“At bottom, there, under the han- 
dle.” 

A small button activated the elec- 
tronic lock. The bolt slid home with 
a buzz. 

Over the technician’s shoulder. 
Dart inspected the words as they 
appeared on the scriptoplast fed into 
the machine from a roll. The 
youngster sweated. Priority one was 
not an everyday occurrence. 

QUERY GROUNDS ASE READY 
TO RECEIVE PR S 1 , Dart saw on the 
sheet. 

The keys were still. Nevertheless, 
the machine clackered rhythmically 
in readiness. 

That single line would cause 
quite a stir back home. Dart im- 
agined men around the console, one 
man breaking away to fetch a 
supervisor. 

The clacker intensified. It seemed 
as if the machine were gathering 
strength. Then the keys began to 
move with great rapidity. A mes- 
sage appeared. 

QUERY RICARDO REPEAT/ 
CONFIRM PR SI SHOW ID

The technician looked up at Dart 
with a question in his eyes. 

“Confirm,” Dart said. They 
don’t want to believe it, he thought.

the youngster typed. 

The answer came immediately. 
QUERY RICARDO IS PRESENCE

Is presence of JT desirablel

rush of delight mingled with anxie- 

GALAXY 




ty. Jonny must be available for 
communications, else base camp 
wouldn’t have put that question to 
them. A dialogue with Jonny would 
be most desirable. Above all Dart 
had dreaded a long wait for a re- 
sponse from Tack, unsure how the 
man had received the message. 

“Desirable,” he said to the wait- 
ing technician, who now typed the 
word. 

SEND MESSAGE RICARDO 
STOP WILL SEND FOR JT 

The technician spread out and 
smoothened Dart’s sheets of scrip- 
toplast and began to type slowly. 
He had difficulty deciphering Dart’s 
small and crabby hand. 

Dart watched through deep-set 
eyes, anxious that every word 
should make it across the vast dis- 
tance to Texahoma. He felt the ex- 
citement rise, mixed with a good 
deal of fear now. .now that he had 
made a commitment to act. 

He wondered what it was like in 
base camp. Did the sun shine? Did 
rain beat a drum on the canvas of 
the tents? Did the steppe wind 
blow, ironing the mutagrass? 

So much depends on the weather, 
he thought anxiously. What if it 
rains and Tack’s in one of his ugly 
moods? 

The Tacks of Kaysee had a mean 
streak. Genius had its price. The 
Tacks paid it in the coin of occa- 
sional madness. Old Tack had had 
his share of that blood, and Jonny 
had inherited both: his father’s gifts 
and curses. 

At last the message had gone 
through. The technician’s hands rest- 
ed on the keyboard. 

MESSAGE RECEIVED RI- 
CARDO STOP STAND BY STOP JT 



MAY WANT TO DISCUSS. RE- 
PEAT. STAND BY. 

Dart tried to guess Tack’s reac- 
tion to the message. Would he 
frown? Would his eyes be puzzled? 
Would the muscles of his neck 
tighten in anger? 

Dart’s heart beat hard behind his 
wrinkled throat. He nearly shivered 
with tension. The machine clack- 
ered evenly. Its internal hammers 
drummed a tattoo against the retain- 
ing bar, eager to tap out another 
message. Then the machine’s noise 
intensified and the words came. 

FRANCO OLD BUDDY IS 
THAT YOU QUERY 

It’s all right, Dart exulted, star- 
ing at the words. 

He noticed the half-anxious, 
half-admiring look on the young- 
ster’s face. Few they were, few in- 
deed, the men Tack addressed as 
“old buddy.” 

“Tell him, ‘Yes, sir,’ ” Dart 
said. 

The technician typed. 

The machine responded im- 
mediately. Dart imagined Tack next 
to the machine, his hand on his hip 
as he dictated.

Dart smiled. It’s be all right. He 
recognized the tone. Jonny was in 
one of his funning moo,ds. 

“Four nine two,” he said. “Five 
eight seven. Nine nine one.” 

The youngster typed. 



JONNY TACK 

Tack stood next to a console, his 

77 



HELIUM 




legs wide apart. One of his hands 
rested on his hip. His head was 
shaved with the exception of a thick 
sheaf of hair at the crown which, in 
the shape of a bushy horsetail, hung 
down blond and shiny over his 
back. A pinched and angry expres- 
sion sat on his face. 

He waved his arms and yelled: 
“Somebody fetch me a chair.” 

Men stirred into action. Seconds 
later a wood-and-canvas chair ap- 
peared behind him. He fell into it. 

“Is it Dart?” he asked. 

The man at the console looked up 
from a list and nodded. 

Tack stared up at the sagging 
canvas roof, at the wires that ran 
along a wrinkle toward the pole- 
supported tent tip. 

“Write,” he said to the operator. 
“Franco, you old skunk, I read 
your little message, but it’s sneaky 
as hell. What’re you trying to tell 
me?” 

Tack glanced about. A ring of 
men had formed at a distance. 
“Clear the hell out,” he yelled. 
“Out, goddammit!” 

Tack sat stretched out in the 
chair, legs forward, the heels of his 
boots sunk into the canvas flooring. 
His horsetail fell over the bright- 
green back of the chair. 

He wondered how long it would 
take to get the story out of Dart. 
The old man always hedged his 
bets. Nearly in his grave, the old 
coot, but ambitious as hell. Some- 
times that could be useful in a man, 
especially a suspicious little ferret 
like Dart. 

Tack weighed all the factors 
while the machine clackered, grew 
agitated, and the keys began to 
flash. 



Dart hated Bono. But Dart was a 
gutless little rat. He wouldn’t dare 
accuse My cal of anything unless it 
had substance. Come to think of it. 
Tack wasn’t sure Dart had made an 
accusation. The message had been 
vague, full of odd hints. An irregu- 
larity in the hostage demand. ? 
What in the hell was that supposed 
to mean? 

“What’s he saying?” Tack 
asked. 

The operator pulled up on the 
yellow cable paper to read the mes- 
sage. 

“ ‘My message, I believe, is 
clear and concise as to facts,’ ” the 
operator read, “ ‘in essence I am 
asking for confirmation of the fact 
that Ae hostage demand can deviate 
from your signed and approved in- 
structions.’ ” 

“Double talk, garbage,” Tack 
shouted. “No, don’t type that.” 

He stared up at the canvas ceiling 
again while the operator waited. 

Something had been done up 
north. Had Bono changed the hos- 
tage demand? Dart would never 
come right out and say it if left a 
chance. 

“Write: Did Bono present the 
Ecofreak demand to BTA? Yes or 
no?” 

Keys clattered. 

“Yes,” the operator said after a 
moment. 

“What was the hostage demand. 
Give the name, only the name.” 

Sidney Unsler. It’d better be that. 
A bold, clean jab right at Union’s 
solar plexus. The number two man 
in Union. That should extract the 
sil-components in a hurry. Tack re- 
membered the loud, whining argu- 
ments about the negotiating 



78 



GALAXY 




strategy. All kinds of devious 
schemes had been proposed. Tack 
had listened to all the garbage. 
Then one night he had smashed his 
fist on the table and had told the 
talkers what he wanted. A simple, 
head-on strategy. No monkey busi- 
ness. 

He glanced at the operator. 
“Well?” 

The man shrugged. “They 
haven’t answered yet.” 

“Goddamn,” Tack yelled. 
“Can’t they spell?” 

Just then the machine clattered 
briefly. 

The operator rolled up the paper 
and leaned into the machine. When 
his head came back up. Tack saw 
agitation in the face, a kind of 
cringing. 

“Well?” he called sharply. 

“Sir,” the man said, almost in a 
whisper, “Regina Unsler.” 

Tack leapt to his feet. His face 
turned purple. Veins bulged on his 
forehead. He was a very tall man. 
His head almost touched the in- 
clined roof of the small tent. Two 
great strides brought him to the 
console. He tore at the yellow cable 
paper. It came away from the 
machine with a sideways rip. 

He stared at the black letters. 
They spelled REGINA UNSLER. 

“Confirm,” he croaked to the 
operator, choked with emotion. 

He had nearly forgotten the little 
bitch. She recalled a troubled 
time. .those sweaty nights, his 
father’s thundering anger, the 
humiliation of six months’ penance 
in the steppe with the herds — all 
that rolled around in him now like a 
down-dipping tornado. 

Above all he remembered with a 



shudder the meeting with his father 
in the old man’s Wellhead home. 
“Stand there, by the door,” the old 
man had ordered. And while Jonny 
stood there feeling small and in- 
timidated, his father cleared a large 
space in the middle of the gloamy 
room ringed by pictures of the an- 
cestors going back nearly to 
LNW-XIII. His father pushed the 
table against the wall with a crack, 
shoved chairs out of the way. 
Lamps crashed as he moved furni- 
ture. That done, the old man turned 
with a flash in those eyes beneath 
the bushy grey brows. “I’ll teach 
you to sully Tack blood,” the old 
man thundered, a fist in the air. 
“Defend yourself like a tribes- 
man.” Then his father beat him to a 
pulp. The old man had been strong 
like an ox to his dying day. Tack 
remembered spitting blood on the 
carpet on hands and knees when it 
had been over. Then he’d been 
sick. The old man forced him to 
clean up the vomit with a bucket 
and cloth like a mutant slave. 

“They confirm,” the operator 
said. 

“Write,” Tack said. “Dart, I 
want to hear it all. Every bit of it. 
From the start. I don’t want any 
double talk or I’ll have you skinned. 
Straight, Dart. Straight.” 

As he waited. Tack tried to give 
Bono the benefit of the doubt. Bono 
might have found some information 
unknown to Ecofreak before. Re- 
gina might be better insurance that 
the components would be delivered. 
But as Dart’s message began to clat- 
ter over the machine, it rapidly dis- 
abused him of such notions. 

He found it easy to construct a 
picture from the words — five-

percenter. .tub. .ball. .dancing

home. .disappeared from 

the. .no sign at breakfast. .late 
arriving at. 

The machine finally stopped. 
Tack stared at the yellow paper. He 
said: “Tell him to stand by.” 

Around the low walls of the tent 
many consoles formed an electronic 
wall. In the middle a thick central 
pole supported the roof. Tack began 
to walk around the tent. He folded 
his arms across his back, unaware 
that it was a mannerism he copied 
from his father. His head was tilted 
forward. His eyes stared at the 
slightly cuffed tips of his boots. 

He let it all sink in without resis- 
tance. He was surprised by his own 
reaction, so bland, so mild. So he 
had been betrayed. It was so simple 
that he almost laughed. The 
Brotherhood of Action had nursed a 
snake. The poisonous viper had 
turned and struck. 

Very well, very well. 

He walked in a circle. On his 
boot tip a rock had tom the shiny 
skin, revealing the white leather 
flesh beneath. 

The Bono clan had its roots deep 
in Texahoma, but the family ex- 
tended far across Hinterland. Tack 
recalled Bonos as far north as Chi- 
ca. Bono fem-folk, in addition, 
linked the clan to many shades of 
political conviction. The poison 
must have crept into the inner circle 
through one of those capillaries. 

Tack conjured up an image of 
Gordon Gono, Mycal’s father, and 
recalled that Gordon had never been 
an enthusiastic Activist. He’d had 
an independent streak — ever off to 
tend his property. Yes, Tack 

80 



thought, the Old Man had said as 
much once. A loner, Gordon Bono. 

And so’s his son! he thought with 
sudden fury. So’s his goddamned 
son! 

Not a mainstream Activist. A lit- 
tle distant, a little aloof. Smart, 
smooth in a way. Tack had picked 
him for his quiet, brainy manner. 
The kind of man who’d get along 
with Union folk but bright enough 
to read them. And Tack had thought 
him strong — not a talker, not run- 
ning at the mouth all the time. 

But he’d been wrong. The man 
was weak. I sent Union a five - 
percenter, a shakey-wakey, a jelly- 
ass. Oh, please Muster Union, suh, 
make this pressure to stop. Not a 
man who’d bite his tongue and 
tough it out. A wobble-knee. 

Then a complex emotion of rage, 
jealousy, envy, and longing pos- 
sessed him. 

He saw Bono ride Regina’s wick- 
ed, foamy saddle through the night. 
He saw them strive. He felt a pain 
and, mixed with it,- he felt a 
treacherous twinge of excitement in 
the loins. It recalled the Pact of 
Chastity. 

My cal Bono, he thought with bit- 
terness. He who had refused with a 
handful of others to join the crusade 
Tack had proposed to the Inner cir- 
cle. Most had sworn a solemn oath 
to shun fem-folk until the structures 
fell. Bono hadn’t said a word, 
hadn’t explained himself. But when 
the others stepped forward, Bono 
stood his ground with a few. He 
was a bachelor and had no reason to 
refuse. 

It seemed to Tack doubly con- 
temptible that Bono, the five- 
percenter, the one man in twenty 



GALAXY 




who couldn’t take gravitron, would 
tiptoe after stnicture-ass the day he 
hit Ricardo. And he’d known where 
to go! Tack’s face darkened. 

The House of the Lord must be 
swept clean. He’d trace down the 
linkages that led through Bono 
blood to the treacherous Accom- 
modationists. He had been too soft 
on them. He had let them scatter to 
their wells, herds, farms. 

The Lord’s brush would sweep 
through the heap of Accom- 
modationist garbage. He’d order an 
action as soon as the structures were 
down. Until then he needed all the 
support he could get to hold the 
fragile Counter Union together. 

The thought of the structures 
brought him out of murky reverie 
into the cold, bright present. 

What if he didn’t get the silco- 
parts? What then? His base of 
power would begin to crack. The 
tribes would drift apart again. His 
father’s dream would crumble; the 
structures would still stand. 

No, he thought with vehemence. 
Never! 

He broke his stride and crossed 
the tent to the manned console. 



DART’S TRIUMPH 

Bono lay on the bed of his locked 
bedroom and spoke on the tel with 
Regina. He was puzzled, worried, 
and delighted all in one. Despite 
tear stains, Regina’s face was beauti- 
ful. Her tone had a kind of desper- 
ate edge. Bono had tried to discover 
what bothered the girl, but she had 
avoided his questions. Instead she 
had pursued a single objective — to 
get him to come to her domain. 

HELIUM 



“Will you come?’’ she asked 
again. 

Bono drew closer to the tel. He 
lay on his stomach and cradled the 
small device in his hands. The bed- 
room was large and comfortable. 
Thick white hare rugs lay on the 
floor. Photos of Hinterland scenes 
hung on the wall. An orange lumi- 
globe burned on the night table to his 
right. < 

“Of course I’ll come,’’ he said. 
“You know I’ll come. But I 
thought that you were adamant. , No 
message on the Media — no to- 
getherness.” 

“Did you ask for me?’’ Her 
voice was anxious. 

Her manner disturbed him. She 
revealed a state of unnatural ex- 
citement. Her head flicked to the 
side with short glances as if she ex- 
pected an interruption. Could she be 
afraid of something? 

He said: “I asked for you, dar- 
ling. They have the demand. I told 
them to announce it on the Media. 
But it wasn’t on the news.” 

“I know,” she said indifferently. 
“I watched. Can you leave 
now?” 

“Of course,” he said. “But. .” 
He hesitated. He longed to be with 
her, but he couldn’t go through 
another night of unsatisfied desire. 
“Do you really want me? I didn’t 
satisfy your condition.” 

She shook her head furiously 
from side to side. “That doesn’t 
matter any more. I shouldn’t have 
been so cruel — not for my sake, not 
for yours. Hurry, darling, and be 
careful, very careful.” 

She’s afraid, she’s anxious. 
Something is wrong. 

“I waited and waited for you to 

81 




call,’’ she continued in a burst of 
words. “I called and called the em- 
bassy, but you couldn’t be reached. ’ ’ 
Regina sounded like a woman in 
love, and Bono felt buoyed up by 
her longing, which he shared. 

“Now you have reached me,’’ he 
said, thinking back over an after- 
noon filled with angry altercations 
between himself and the delegates. 
They had sought him out singly and 
in groups to demand explanations. 
He refused to discuss the matter, 
but in the process also discovered 
how totally indifferent he felt about 
the Helium round. Only she mat- 
tered. 

“Tell me,’’ he said. “You said 
that 1 should be careful. Why? is 
something wrong?’’ 

“Nothing,” she answered, but 
Bono saw a furtive motion in her 
eyes. She appeared to change her 
mind. “There. .there are some 
strange men outside. I. .1 don’t 
know what they might want. .” 
“I’ll be right over,” he said, 
alarmed more by her manner than 
her words. “Right away.” 

He undressed and took a quick 
shower. The rush of water en- 
livened him, and his sense of dull 
fatigue gave way to exhilaration. He 
dried himself before the mirror, 
pleased by his lithe, hairy, healthy 
body. 

For a second he felt again what 
he had felt the night before — an ir- 
repressible good humor. 

“Hey, man,” he said aloud to 
his mirror image. “Hey, you 
know something? I don’t give a shit 
about the Crestmore prophesies.” 

He grinned at himself. 

The grin reminded him of another 
Bono — his younger self. A flash of 

82 



insight sobered his face. Then he 
broke into a grin again. It had oc- 
curred to him that all those years at 
the Academy of Action had been a 
sham. 

He combed his hair and beard. 
He gave a twirl to his mustaches. 
He thought: I realty don't believe in 
that religion stuff. Hell, I don’t 
want to change the world. Jutting 
nonsense. 

At the moment the world seemed 
marvellously beautiful. There she 
was, almost within reach. He 
frowned for a second, thinking of 
her strange mood. Well, he would 
console her. 

He left the shower and quickly 
dressed. He whistled a tune. The 
words went: “I am a kid from 
Texaho, the prairie she be my 
hooome. .” 

Across the room hung a photo- 
graph of the many-peaked Sierra 
Petra. He stared at it while his right 
foot wiggled and worried into his 
boot. Then he heard the drumbeat 
of feet outside. He looked at the 
door. Someone called his name. 

“Bono! Are you in there? Open 
up!” 

He recognized Dart’s voice and 
heard its harsh, commanding tone. 

Bono instantly grasped the situa- 
tion. Damn! He shouldn’t have 
showered. No matter. In all leisure 
he pushed his foot into the boot. 
Resistance would be useless. He’d 
think about Regina when all this 
was over. 

Outside Dart hammered on the 
door and repeated his call. 

Bono opened the door at last, and 
the little man nearly fell in. One of 
his fists was raised. In the other he 
held strips of blue scriptoplast. Sev- 



GALAXY 




eral of the delegates stood grimly 
behind him, hands on the handles of 
ceremonial daggers. They appeared 
to be under the command of beefy 
Dulsol, chief of embassy mainte- 
nance, who held a pistol. 

Dart lowered his arm and com- 
posed himself. He inspected Bono’s 
face. The forked beard stood out 
aggressively, the mustache tips were 
turned up. Dart felt sorry for Bono. 
He had the face that should make 
structures crumble. But he lacked 
that special something. .that vi- 
brant quality of leadership. 

In the center of the room Dart 
took up a dignified stance, one foot 
out in front of the other. 

“Better sit down, Bono.” 

He eyed the ex-chief with displeas- 
ure now. Bono had a little grin on 
his face. That grin would fade away 
in a hurry. In no time at all Bono 
would be on ice. 

Bono smiled, amused by the little 
man’s obvious air of self- 
importance. He decided to humor 
the little rat. He walked to the bed, 
sat down on its edge, folded his 
arms across his chest. 

“Let me read you something, 
Bono,” Dart said. 

He arranged scriptoplast sheets. 
“I have a cable from Jonny Tack,” 
he announced. Bono saw sparks of 
triumph in the deep-set eyes. “Let 
me read you what the leader says.” 

Dart looked up at Bono and noted 
that the man still grinned. 

“ ‘I, Jonny Tack, Leader of the 
Counter Union, apprised of certain 
treasonable activities by my ap- 
pointed Chief of Mission, hereby 
remove him from that post and or- 
der him delivered to me under 
armed guard. I appoint Franco Dart 

HELIUM 



acting Chief of Mission until such 
time as a new chief can be ap- 
pointed.’ ” 

Dart lowered the scriptoplast and 
looked at Bono. He said: 

“This much you have need to 
know. There is a good deal more, 
of course. It might interest you to 
know that I am also provisional 
ambassador. ’ ’ 

Bono came to his feet and made 
for Dart. For a second Dart re- 
treated, thinking this was an attack. 
At the door Dulsol lurched forward 
with a grunt. But then Dart saw 
Bono’s eagerly extended hand. 

“My dear Franco,” Bono cried, 
grinning, “Let me be the first to 
congratulate you.” 

Dart witheld his hand for a sec- 
ond and viewed Bono with dark 
suspicion. But the man’s eyes 
seemed sincerely pleased even if 
that grin was insolent, and congratu- 
lations were in order. Dart took 
Bono’s extended hand, shook it, 
dropped it, and withdrew a pace or 
two with a sideways glance at the 
waiting delegates. 

“You have a big job ahead of 
you, Franco,” Bono pursued. 
“Good luck to you. Now, I sup- 
pose, you’ll put me under arrest? Or 
do I start for home tonight?” 

“Take him away, men,” Dart 
said, almost in a whisper, and Dul- 
sol’s huge hand soon grabbed 
Bono’s elbow, jerked. Bono walked 
down the hall, thinking about Tack, 
thinking that this move was typieal 
of that ox. He hadn’t checked with 
Bono, hadn’t called for his side of 
the story. Tack had acted from 
emotion — as always. 

The guards led him through the 
ornate parts of the embassy and 



83 




from there into a neglected, empty 
wing. Two men walked in front, 
two behind. As the group turned a 
comer, Bono saw coming toward 
them another and similar comple- 
ment: two guards, a young woman, 
two guards. 

In the narrow, dilapidated cor- 
ridor, the groups had to squeeze 
past one another. For a second 
Bono looked at the girl and she at 
him. Her situation seemed like his 
own. Her eyes flashed a knowing 
look. He had never seen her before. 
She wore a long, blue gown and 
had a white stole over her 
shoulders — very formally dressed 
for a prisoner. 

In a second she was past and he 
continued on toward whatever 
prison Dart had decreed. 



THE LITTLE SPEECH 

Eight flames , of the inner circle 
supped around a low, rectangular 
table seated on legless, cushioned 
chairs. The lights were dim, music 
subdued. Pink-robed servants cho- 
sen for small size and delicate fea- 
tures hovered around the guests or 
moved about in the obsequious 
small-step. They served Peacefreak 
duck in dark wooden bowls and hot 
Maoling wine in shallow, pearl- 
white porcellain cups. 

“This casual — dare I say 
haphazard? — meeting pleases me 
the more in that no conquest past or 
prospective will be feasted, and we 
are joined merely as close friends.” 

Through the faintly blue curtain 
of incense smoke that rose to the 
ceiling from a slit in the table, 
Clafto Meyer listened with a smile 

84 



as Luke Payne began his little 
speech in faultless Latin. 

The dinner had been called on 
short notice as a kind of secret 
celebration. No one quite said out 
loud why they were gathered here, 
the men closest to the Fire, but each 
one knew the reason, and each 
knew that the others knew, and so 
what Payne said had a special sig- 
nificance. It was titillating precisely 
because he didn’t say it all. 

Payne lifted his shallow cup, held 
it in both hands; he spoke with his 
face inclined over the wine. He was 
the fifth man to try a little speech, 
but Clafto was sure that Luke would 
outdo the rest. 

“As I taste the fire of this wine 
and savor the fey aroma of the 
steppes, 1 disagree with Jackson, 
Clafto. The question is before us: 
What is the peak of all delights? To 
Jackson it’s a blooming rose whose 
soft red petals gently cup a dew- 
bedecked, delicate, pink interior. 
And he would be a hairy bumble 
bee with leave to plunge into that 
rose to bathe in the dew and suck 
the nectar. And if the petals should 
close at night, he’d gladly gambol 
in that soft prison until dawn.” 

To the sound of appreciative 
chuckles, Luke Payne looked up. 

He is delightful, Clafto thought. 
He has improved on Jackson’s little 
speech and hasn’t had his own say 
yet. It’ll be bawdy, so much is cer- 
tain. 

Clafto was glad that he had drop- 
ped the hint this morning after his 
talk with the Fire. It pleased him 
that the senior flames had organized 
this feast. Sidney’s second in com- 
mand deserved such small, thought- 
ful attentions. 



GALAXY 




Clafto found it especially appro- 
priate that he should be held in such 
esteem. Unlike the others, he 
wouldn’t be. replaced. None of Sid- 
ney’s earlier favorites had com- 
plemented the Fire’s personality to 
such an admirable extent. Sidney 
had said as much this morning. 

He looked about at the flames 
and thought; They vie for my favor. 
Next to Sidney I’m the most impor- 
tant man in Union. 

“The peak of all delights?’’ 
Payne asked rhetorically. He had a 
scar from ear to chin on his left 
side, a special mark of initiation ac- 
quired in Sidney’s gymnasium. In a 
face somewhat flushed with wine, 
the scar was white. 

“To me delight is in the doing. I 
like to make things. I like to cook, 
to bake. I love the smell in the 
kitchen, the heat of the stove. My 
favorite activity is to bake a little 
cake, a tidy little loaf, you under- 
stand, with a neat little crack in the 
middle, nicely rounded and 
browned. A puckered little crack, 
my brothers, and hot inside.” 

Through an arched opening oppo- 
site Clafto ’s seat at the head of the 
table, he saw a servant appear over 
the shiny marble floor of the outer 
hall. The servant came toward them 
in a hurry. 

“To make my favorite cake, I 
first take two eggs and I put them 
on the table. Two eggs,” he said, 
stressing the point, “if you see 
what I mean. Then I pick myself a 
little pot. Not too large, not too 
small; a round little pot, white and 
red with a bit of black in the right 
places. I put the pot next to the 
eggs. Then I take a little lard, 
smooth, silky lard, gentlemen, just 

HELIUM 



enough to cover a finger, and with 
it I smear the inside of the pot, not 
too fast and not too slow, but all 
around the lip and then deeper and 
deeper. I probe the pot, I plumb its 
depths with that lardy finger, slowly, 
as if I were caressing some- 
thing. ...” 

liie servant had stopped next to 
ClaftOj bent down, whispered. 

Clafto rose. “You must excuse 
me, friends,” he said. “Something 
has happened.” 

He followed the servant out of 
the room, through the arched door- 
way, across the marble. The blue 
light of an active tel shone from an 
alcove. He sat down before it and 
looked at one of the sparks of his 
group — Silvester. 

“Well, Sil? What’s up?” 

“We’ve got her,” Sil said. He 
seemed out of breath. “Eerie fern, 
cold as ice.” 

Clafto raised his eyebrows. 
“Show me,” he said. 

The image in his screen began to 
move as Silverter lifted the tel on 
the other end and pointed it toward 
the center of a murky room. Clafto 
saw the wife of French demurely 
seated on a chair. He couldn’t see 
her features clearly, but he recog- 
nized the blue gown and white 
stole. 

The tel returned to its original 
angle and Silvester’s face reap- 
peared. 

“How did it happen?” 

Silvester shrugged. “The em- 
bassy door opened, and there she 
was. It looked like she had been 
pushed or shoved out. She didn’t 
leave of her own accord. We let her 
walk down the street a bit, then we 
picked her up.”

Clafto frowned. Although he 
couldn’t decipher precisely what 
BTA might have in mind, he feared 
a trap of some kind. 

“Where are you now?’’ 

“Upstairs in the Cosmos Club. In 
the private rooms.’’ 

“Good. Stay there. .’’ He 
thought for a second. 

Silvester had three others with 
him. The group was too small if 
BTA had ideas of a rescue. Word 
had come from Blottingham in 
mid-afternoon that unusual things 
were going on in BTA. 

“I’m giving dinner with some 
men of the circle,’’ Clafto said. 
“After we’re done. I’ll come to get 
her — with a larger party. Just in 
case BTA is setting up a trap. It 
might be late, but we’ll be there. 
Meanwhile, don’t let her get 
away.’’ 

Silvester nodded. 

“Cheers, Sil. And good work.” 

Clafto switched off. 

Sidney would be delighted. The 
wife of French was better than 
nothing — precious bait. She’d lure 
the man. But it bothered Clafto that 
she had been so easy to capture. 
Why had she been expelled from 
the embassy? Where was her hus- 
band? The situation demanded ex- 
treme care. 

He returned to the dining flames. 

He stood for a second before 
sinking into his cushioned seat. 

“Fortuna smiles,” he said. 
“We’ve caught the female. Silves- 
ter has her upstairs in the Cosmos 
Club. I propose a little venture, 
brothers. Let’s dine in leisure. Then 
you might accompany me to the 
Cosmos with some of your sparks. 
From there you might escort me to 

86 



West Tower Top where I have a lit- 
tle chore or two before me. .” He 
smiled. Faces smirked back. “Then 
you might deliver our prize to the 
Fire. He told me this morning that 
he has a personal interest in this lit- 
tle matter.” 



IN THE STADIUM 

Half past ten. 

French walked down stairs and 
stopped in one of the entrances of 
the hexagonal BTA stadium. The 
place echoed with voices. People 
moved about. Someone ex- 
perimented with the lights, dimming 
them on and off, switching entire 
sections. 

Once this room had been the Hall 
of Burgesses. Now it was a gym- 
nasium, ballroom, assembly hall. 
Basketball goals hung from the ceil- 
ing. The floor gleamed with painted 
lines for all manner of games. 
Bleachers pressed up against ancient 
marble. 

BTA staff milled about on the 
floor. Some wore jump suits and tot- 
ed chemguns. Some wore robes 
and had obviously come to watch 
the evening’s entertainment — 
whatever it would be. French had 
still to learn the details about Opera- 
tion Hairy-Scary. 

He didn’t see Dickens, Corner, or 
any of the other leaders. 

French suppressed a pulse of irri- 
tation. He moved into the stadium 
carrying his chemgun. Its barrel was 
telescoped down so that the device 
was barely more than a pistol with 
an over-large stock. He sat down on 
a bench to wait. 

A deep breath and its slow exha- 

GALAXY 




lation failed to break his tension. 
Since that moment in the elevator 
when he’d looked forward to this 
hour, French had had a wretched 
time. His only consolation was that 
his preparations for Miri’s security 
had gone well enough. 

He had called Miri in mid- 
afternoon. Reluctant tribesmen 
brought her to the tel, and French 
reassured himself that she was all 
right. He recalled now the warning 
she had given him. He’d asked her 
how she was, and she said that she 
was all right. But she’d had a 
troublesome intuition, premonition, 
call it what you will. About him. 
She urged him to be careful. He 
couldn’t get more out of her with 
tribesmen watching the conversa- 
tion. 

French wondered what she could 
have had in mind, then shrugged it 
off. He could take care of himself. 
Everything would go smoothly. 

After several attempts, he had 
reached Dachsy Jones less than an 
hour ago. The leader of the Kay ring 
Gang had wrinkled up in embar- 
rassed pleasure at the sight of 
French — embarrassing French in 
turn. Years ago Dachsy had been 
Number Two and French a youthful 
runner in his service. But now their 
roles seemed reversed, at least so 
far as Dachsy was concerned. 
Dachsy had scratched his short- 
cropped head, shy like a youngster. 
He insisted on calling French “sir.” 
When French ejtplained the situa- 
tion, Dachsy offefed to rescue Miri 
himself with men from the gang, all 
eagerness to help. But French shook 
his head. All he wanted was a safe 
place for Miri. They made an ap- 
pointment for eleven, eleven-thirty, 

HEUUM 



at the Scuttle-but, a coffee house 
controlled by the gang. 

French stared out over the 
stadium floor. People moved about 
aimlessly, restlessly. If Dickens 
didn’t show up soon, French would 
be late for that appointment. 

Miri’s safety mesmerized him — 
had distracted him all day long. 
French had never before experi- 
enced the tension between personal 
and collective concerns as deeply. 
The sooner she was safe, the sooner 
he could devote himself to the job 
at hand. 

Proctor’s single-minded madness 
had intensified rather than di- 
minished during the day. The man 
had convinced himself that Ecofreak 
would deal with him if he held out 
the silco-parts. Which was true 
enogh. French had the same convic- 
tion. But it was wrong — 
dangerously wrong. 

Proctor’s eyes had narrowed 
sharply during their last session to- 
gether. French saw himself report- 
ing wearily, exhausted by the all- 
day session with Clemmens, Ful- 
bright, and the staff. That session 
deteriorated into a brawl of words at 
the end. Clemmens and the staff 
withdrew to one pole, Fulbright to 
the other. French tried to mediate 
between the two, but the combat- 
ants were beyond reason. At last 
Fulbright stuffed his briefcase an- 
grily and left in a huff. French had 
to tell Proctor that no consensus had 
been reached. The silco-parts might 
be oscillation control devices, as 
Clemmens had insisted they were; 
or they could be “components for 
some magical prayer machine,” as 
Fulbright, in a moment of white 
fury, had shouted in a shrill voice. 

87 




Proctor said: “Let’s hope they 
are oscillation what-you-ma-call-its. 
I don’t think Ecofreak will risk 
much over prayer wheels.’’ 

We are losing our minds, French 
thought in the stadium, rubbing his 
eyes. 

Right now, with Miri in the Eco- 
freak embassy and flames all over 
the place looking for him, French 
saw the Secret Agenda in a very 
different light. Politics didn’t seem 
important. Even the plan itself ap- 
peared to be a fabric of madness. 

Preposterous notion, French 
thought. An old incident served as 
model for the plan. Eight years ago 
three gravitron drums had failed 
suddenly in South Tower one sum- 
mer night. For reasons that were 
still under investigation, the back-up 
units failed to come on line and 
structure collapse began in South 
with a series of horrible thunder- 
cracks. The ensuing panic shook 
Ricardo to its foundations. 

But there was a big difference be- 
tween that event and what Proctor 
planned, French reflected. Eight 
years ago the trouble had been 
quickly fixed. No revolutionary 
group had waited in the wings, 
ready to exploit the panic. This time 
the trouble would last as long as 
Proctor wished. And the Group 
would be poised for a coup. 

French yawned and stretched his 
arms toward the ceiling. 

Could Proctor hide an Interdiction 
for five days? he wondered, slump- 
ing again. Even with the full coop- 
eration of the Ministry of Engineer- 
ing? In five days reserve supplies of 
the gas would be exhausted. At that 
point the grav-drums would begin to 
heat up. Automatic temperature con- 

88 



trol devices would begin to slow 
down their revolutions. The gravi- 
tron would thin out in the cables. 
Thundercracks would resound 
again. And there would be no 
Helium in the pipeline, no way to 
fix the problem. Panic everywhere 
— panic in the towers, panic in 
Top Level, panic in the Ministry 
of Defense. But one voice would be 
calm in all that uproar — Proctor’s 
voice over the Media and the public 
address system. The Unslers have 
gambled with your safety, people 
of Ricardo. But I can restore the 
Helium flow if you give me the 
power. 

Unreal, French thought. Unreal. 

He shook himself and stood up. 
Exhaustion robbed him of objectivi- 
ty. The plan wasn’t all that bad. 
He’d thought about it often in the 
past and it had seemed a reasona- 
ble, even a clever scheme. Nothing 
less than the threat of structure col- 
lapse could shake Unsler’s grip over 
the instruments of power, could 
wake the people from their dreadful 
apathy. It all seemed crazy now, 
but French was tired and depressed. 

Where in the hell was Dickens? 

A catnap in the cubohome 
Dachsy would put at their disposal 
would refresh him enough so that 
he could come back and do battle 
again, French thought. Clemmens 
needed help. Before French had left 
Proctor, Proctor had ordered plans 
to be drawn up, schedules to be fixed. 
“Proceed as if we were going 
to deliver those parts,’’ Proctor 
said. “I haven’t made a final deci- 
sion, but should I decide, I want 
everything ready to go on short 
notice. As soon as you have a de- 
livery schedule, get back to me.’’ 

GALAXY 




He has to be stopped, French 
thought. I have to make him see 
reason. 

A change in the low buzz of voices 
around him brought French back 
to the present. His eyes sought the 
origin of the excitement. Two men 
rolled a wooden log into the 
stadium as one rolls a barrel, on its 
edge. A bald man naked to the 
waist came behind the log with an 
axe in his hand. What in hell. ? 
French watched the men set up the 
block in the middle of the stadium. 
The bald man approached it. He 
hefted the axe back and sank it into 
the wood with a dull report. 

Then French saw Dickens emerge 
from a narrow door between two 
sets of bleachers. His assistants 
came behind him. French rose and 
made toward the group. He wanted 
to know what that block signified, 
half suspecting that Proctor had 
flipped. 



VI 

CAGED BIRDS 

A group of flames in shimmering 
white rot«s moved above the inter- 
tower beltway. Passengers down be- 
low glanced furtively at the west- 
bound assembly, reserve in their 
faces. Prestigious family signs 
blazed in bright colors on the no- 
bles’ tubes — ^Sidney’s companions. 
Best to be inconspicuous and to 
keep the eyes low. 

Miri rode in the middle of the 
group surrounded by at least three 
circles of flames — a blue stone in a 
silver setting. 

Clafto led the group. He wore a 
red scarf around his neck. He had 



bathed and oiled his body for her 
after dinner. A suitable love offering 
for the slender bitch, he mused wiA 
an inward sneer, picturing Regina, 
relaxed at last. Leaving the Cos- 
mos, he’d been a little apprehen- 
sive. But they had dropped down 
East shaft without mishap. They’d 
made it to the beltway undisturbed. 
They hadn’t even seen a man from 
BTA. Blottingham’s rumors were 
absurd.' Clafto had suspected as 
much. Ridiculous notion. Proctor 
wouldn’t dare challenge Sidney. 
Proctor was popular and this was a 
Helium year. Even so, Proctor had 
to think about the future. Bernie 
would die sooner or later. Then 
Proctor would have a new boss. 

Clafto’s thoughts returned to Re- 
gina. He’d jut her with a ven- 
geance. To jut the little bitch would 
put the final touch on his new status 
in the Circle of Fire. Too bad Sid- 
ney had had to force her into com- 
pliance. But that would steal noth- 
ing from the pleasure of her las- 
civious corpus. Clafto imagined all 
the ways in which he’d force her to 
give him pleasure. He’d excercise 
her until dawn. 

Behind him, masked by other no- 
bles, Miri rode, her face serene, 
eyes closed. Right now, right here, 
she’d prove the Teaching, the subtle 
power of the Lady. Madonna sat at 
the Eternal Wheel and spun Time’s 
gossamer thread. She wove it into 
the many-colored pattern of Fate. 
The Lady was transcending, om- 
nipotent Mind. Miri was the Lady; 
she herself was part of that Sub- 
stance. And if she could rise above 
the Bondage of Attachment, she too 
could weave a pattern with her 
mind. Any pattern she chose. The 



HELIUM 



89 




pattern of love, the pattern of death, 
yes, the pattern of escape. Miri had 
never tried to do this. It hadn’t been 
necessary. But now the time had 
come for a test. 

She imagined a bird in a cage. 
She made the vision sharp and clear 
behind closed eyes. A flame oper- 
ated her tube lest she escape like 
Frenchy had done the other night. 
She could devote herself entirely to 
her project — the yellow bird and a 
cage whose bars she imagined to be 
silvery white like the robes of her 
captors. 

She set the image firmly in her 
mind, complete with all detail — the 
litter at the bottom of the cage, the 
tiny cup of water, the cage door and 
its latch, open windows across the 
room, a blue sky and a fluffy cloud 
beyond the windows. Next she im- 
agined a hand reaching down. The 
hand unlocked her cage. In a flutter 
of wings she made a straight line 
for the window, and in seconds she 
soared high into the air. 

Next Miri felt her freedom. She 
made herself feel it with as deep 
and real an emotion as she could 
muster. The Teachings said that 
strong emotion helped the process. 

This done, Miri opened her eyes 
and took a deep breath — always a 
pleasure after intense concentration. 

Meanwhile the group had entered 
West Tower’s shaft, and the tubes 
were rising. She was as much a 
prisoner as ever, but now she was 
certain that she’d be freed. She had 
formed a clear, sharp image of her 
desire. She had watched it serenely. 
‘Detached Desire,’ the Cult called 
it. At the end she had blessed the 
results with a powerful but directed 
pulse of feeling. 

90 



Above her in the shaft, Clafto’s 
mind ran at random over recollec- 
tions and anticipations. At the mo- 
ment he thought about Luke’s little 
speech and found that it had been 
superb, despite the interruption. 
Worthy of magnificatio. That end- 
ing when he’d broken the eggs and 
hurled them into the sweetened 
crack of the hot little loaf. .dolce, 
truly dolce. In the end he would 
drape Regina over the back of a 
stool, head down, fingers to her 
toes. Then he’d crack his belt over 
her little loaf just to remind her of 
past rejections. From this thought 
his mind went on to imagine oAer 
things he might do to her in that 
bent-over position. 

Under the sway of such rousing 
thoughts, he nearly missed the 
feeder street through which — a nar- 
row channel (another clever theme 
for a little speech) — ^they would ap- 
proach Regina’s palace. He acti- 
vated sidejets just in time, and his 
tube roared into the feeder. He 
checked his advance^ glanced back. 
The group had followed and he 
went forward, pleased by his send- 
off. The brightest flames, the choi- 
cest of the choice. Once he had 
slipped into Regina’s burrow, the 
whole assembly would continue 
on — a triumphal parade. They’d de- 
liver French’s wife to Sidney. No 
man who touched a flame could 
hope to escape the consequences. 

He had nearly reached the end of 
the feeder when grey-clad men in 
large numbers appeared at the 
mouth of the channel. Some were in 
jump tubes at his level, some on 
foot on the ground — weird figures 
in gas masks. Chemguns pointed in 
his direction. 



GALAXY 




With an expression of painful 
surprise, Clafto turned and looked 
hack at the group. Beyond them 
crouched more men. He thought of 
UFA just as the invisible gas 
reached him and he lost conscious- 
ness. 

^ ^ * 

Selma burst into the mistress’ 
lavorite room. Through wide-open 
and somewhat bulging eyes she took 
in the scene at a glance. 

The poor mistress sat on the di- 
van, a clump of misery. Her legs 
were up. She hugged them against 
her body. Her chin rested on her 
knees. Selma saw her rocking dumb- 
ly back and forth among pink pil- 
lows on the white divan, wearing 
nothing but a flimsy blouse and a 
pair of panties. 

“They’re gone, mistress!’’ Selma 
cried. “They’ve left.’’ 

Slowly Regina looked up at her 
maid, a dull expression in her eyes. 

I he eyes mirrored hour-long 
agonies — a roller-coaster ride of 
wild, turbulent hope followed by 
ihc sickening drops into suicidal de- 
spair. The eyes said: I’m tired, 
wrung out, flat. She felt like the 
I’.ut-string of one of those guitars 
made by Bluegrass Territory that 
had lost its tension after too much 
play. 

“Who,” she asked in a hollow 
voice. “Who’s gone?” 

“The men, the flames.” 

Regina dropped her head to her 
knees and stared down at her toes 
again. Ten little ghomes, side by 
side. One little piggy went to the 
market, one little piggy went. 
I'he toenails glistened with irrides- 



cent sheen. The polish changed col- 
ors slowly with every shift in tem- 
perature, however small. Made espe- 
cially for her ladyship. Her 
pedicurist had sworn it was the only 
formulation of its kind in Union. 

Gone. .left. ? 

She didn’t believe it. All her faith 
had drained away like liquid from a 
cracked gourd. Faithless humanity. 
Mycal, the traitor. It was well past 
eleven, and he hadn’t come. His 
passion must have cooled in the 
sobriety of day. He’d lied to her on 
the tel in the late afternoon. He 
wouldn’t help her escape, and she 
feared setting out alone. Regina, the 
traitor. Regina, who’d betrayed her- 
self, whose courage had fizzed like 
a punctured baloon. In the glass- 
domed garden upstairs stood jump 
tubes placed there on her orders. 
Two of them — one for him, one for 
her. When Mycal hadn’t come, she 
had dressed to make her escape 
alone, through the roof. But she had 
shrunk from the venture and had 
slunk back defeated. She had un- 
dressed, had made herself ready for 
the inevitable. 

Selma watched her mistress rock- 
ing, reminded of a child. 

“Mistress, aren’t you glad?” 

“Glad?” 

“Yes, glad. The men are gone. 
Don’t you want to get away? Don’t 
you want to visit Sister Serenita?” 

“They’re not gone, Selma. I 
know it. It’s just a ruse. Just some- 
thing nasty Sidney would do.” 

Selma had her mouth open, ready 
to answer, when they both heard the 
melodious chime from the front 
hall. 

With a dull, resigned emotion, 
Regina understood why the flames 



HELIUM 



91 




were gone. They were no longer 
needed. Clafto had arrived. She 
would be shamed after all. The days 
of hope were nothing but illusion. It 
would be like before. Four times 
now Sidney’s chosen of the moment 
had stood before her portals waiting 
to be admitted. 

I’ll be like a rag. I’ll submit like 
a thing, a soulless thing! And to- 
morrow. 

Something. She’d do something 
tomorrow. 

“Let him in” she said to Selma 
as the chime sounded again, twice 
in a row, impatiently. “Let him 
in,” she sighed. 



AN EMPTY CAGE 

French kept his finger on the but- 
ton, and the pressure produced in- 
side the first six notes of 
Woodstock, the Ecofreak tribal an- 
them. 

The steel cable of his self-control 
threatened to snap. Tension and anx- 
iety overrode the dull fatigue he 
felt. Conflicting needs tore at him 
and filled his mind with flashing 
pictures. Miri. Miri came first. In 
the press of troubles around him, he 
grasped for fundamentals. Self pres- 
ervation. The family, however 
tiny. But French also feared for the 
larger family — BTA. He would go 
see Proctor the moment Miri was 
safe. Now he understood the chop- 
oing block. Proctor had to be stopped. 
His politician’s flair for grand 
gestures would extract too high a 
price. What’s the matter with every- 
thing, he thought. Has the world 
c r of .’j rocker? 

x-fench rang the bell again. Worry 

92 



and fear gathered his throat into a 
lump. Why didn’t Ecofreak open 
the goddamned door? He wanted 
Miri now I He wanted to know her 
safely hid away. 

Behind him Comer watched at 
the head of a small group of men, 
the flat face empty of expression. 
Corner was an elderly man with a 
somewhat shapeless Hgure that did 
not make a good appearance in the 
tight-fitting, zippered jump suit he 
and the others wore. Comer 
watched French, disliking what he 
saw. The grim, desperate look had 
come upon the young DA when 
they had swooped down on this spot 
approaching from either end of 
Outer Ring in a hurry, reflected in 
the glass and polished brass of the 
well-to-do housefronts and — hadn’t 
found a single flame! 

Thoughts ran through Comer’s 
mind, thoughts about “love” and 
slum kids who had risen too high. 
He for one didn’t have the rank to 
traffic with the famous DA, Intelli- 
gence, but he knew' what every man 
knew about the man — a real roman- 
tic, he was. No man would marry' 
in this day and age unless he 
thought he genuinely loved. Love? 
Why, it was like astrology — not 
very reliable, but you couldn’t con- 
vince some people of that. 

Comer hoped that the girl was in- 
side, safe and sound. French had a 
reputation. People said he had a 
crazy streak, and it wasn’t merely a 
fable. In his early days he’d 
volunteered — yes, volunteered! — for 
sixteen missions into Hinterland. If 
that wasn’t evidence of madness. 

Now he saw French release the 
bell. The blond DA stepped back 
and kicked at the portal once. 



GALAXY 




twice, again. The thick bronze 
door, decorated with pastoral Hin- 
terland scenes in reUef, gave a dull 
gong-like sound. 

Balled fists. Flashing eyes. 
French looked as if fire would spout 
from his nostrils. Gomer couldn’t 
escape the thought: A low-level 
man who had made good. Some- 
thing about French brought to 
Corner’s mind a sense of the ele- 
mental, the crude, the uncontrolled. 
He must have looked like this in the 
East Tower slums — the gangster 
from Branco. No hint of the polish 
he’d acquired in later years. 

French felt the cable of his self- 
control snap. He kicked the door 
again, his blood in a boil. On the 
second kick a small square window 
opened in the door, displacing a rci 
finery of bronze. Black eyes, 
brows, the nose of a tribesman 
filled the apperture. 

“I’m Rivera French,” French 
said. “I’ve come to get my wife.” 

“She isn’t here.” 

The statement came like a fist 
into his stomach, taking his breath 
away. 

“What do you mean, she isn’t 
here? Where is she?” 

“I don’t know.” 

French controlled the urge to leap 
at the tiny opening, to grab for the 
face. 

“Open up,” he husked. “Open 
up this instant. I want to see the 
ambassador.” 

Gomer heard the deadly tone and 
winced, wondering if he should step 
in to restrain the man. But then he 
decided it wasn’t his place. 

“Ambassador Dart doesn’t wish 
to receive you.” 

“Ambassador Dartl Where’s 



Barney?” 

Thoughts raced through French’s 
mind. Dart had walked out of the 
negotiations. Last night he had op- 
posed giving them sanctuary. 

“Mr. Barney is no longer ambas- 
sador,” the man said. 

“Why? What happened?” 

“I’m not at liberty to say.” 

Silence. Gomer watched French 
thinking. The blue eyes stared at the 
door, fixed to a spot next to the 
square opening. The DA’s face was 
flushed. Muscles worked in his 
cheeks. 

“What did you do with her?” 

“Mrs. French was asked to 
leave.” 

“When? How long ago?” 

Gomer noted a change in the 
DA’s tone. Now it was cool, icy, 
but somehow even more disturbing. 

“Seven, seven-thirty.” 

“Did you see flames on the 
ring?” 

“I saw nothing. Mister. I wasn’t 
here.” 

French abruptly turned from the 
door and made for his jump tube. 
Before Gomer could react, French 
jabbed the device alive with angry 
fingers. In a second the tube rose 
up and curved away with a scream 
of jets. 

“Mr. French. .Mr. French. .” 

But the DA heard nothing. 
Within an eyewink he disappeared 
from Gover’s view around the bend 
of Outer Ring. 



ESCAPE 

“Mistress, mistress, it'shiml” 
Regina felt confused. She would 
have been angry with Selma if 

93 



HELIUM 




she’d had the energy to be angry. 
What did the silly female want. 

She said: “Of course it’s him. I 
told you that before.’’ 

Selma shook her head with great 
exaggeration. Her bulging eyes 
were wide open with some kind of 
mindless astonishment. 

“Not him. Miss Ginny. The other 
one, the man from Hinterland.’’ 

Regina lifted her head sharply, 
uncoiled her legs, and jumped to 
her feet. Her fatigue had fled. The 
vigour she felt surprised her in a 
subliminal way. She saw her own 
image in the gold-laced mirror op- 
posite, a girl in panties and a white 
blouse. But this was not the girl 
who’d sat in a miserable clump. 
The breasts were out, the chin was 
high. 

“You mean. .’’ she whispered. 

Selma’s head went up and down 
with an exaggerated affirmation. 

Regina felt blood throb in her 
throat. One of her hands fluttered 
up. 

“Bring him in,” she said, “but 
give me time to slip into this.” 

Earlier, in anticipation of escape, 
she had worn a zippered fortress of 
a jump suit. She slipped into it 
now. It fit her snugly. The smooth 
silk over thermal fluff slid along her 
skin. The outside was made of 
miraculous polyhide with molecules 
so tightly linked a knife couldn’t 
have pierced it. Her seamstress had 
designed it especially for her. No 
other lady in Union — 

She saw movement from the 
corner of her eyes — and he was 
there! 

With a gladness that made her 
sob, she flew to the archangel. Her 
tears moistened his face. She mum- 



bled incoherently. Her lips sought 
his with a kind of hunger. Her 
hands caressed his face. Gradually 
she calmed down, withdrew a little, 
looked at him. Mycal’s eyes echoed 
her own gladness, but his face was 
drawn and pale, his clothes dirty 
and rumpled. Soil clung to his 
hands, dried blood marked numer- 
ous cuts. She hadn’t noticed. 

Regina had a vision of Mycal 
fighting outside against flames to be 
at her side. She asked him what had 
happened. Had he been accosted in 
the street? 

Bono shook his head. He said: 
“I’m in trouble, Regina.” 

He didn’t feel like a man in trou- 
ble. He had passed through a kind 
of eerie hell and stood in heaven 
now — supplicant before the Queen. 
Behind him lay the pulsing darkness 
of a labyrinth of service chasms. He 
had escaped through a hole in the 
closet of his prison which had been 
blocked by a loose plate. He had 
groped and stumbled in the depths 
while tiny sparks electrified the air 
and clung to his beai;d like micro- 
scopic fire flies. Great shudders of 
machinery coming alive and dying 
terrorized him. Large rats shadowed 
his progress. They ran along ledges 
he couldn’t see. They crouched on 
cable strands and stared hungrily 
through luminous, greenish eyes — 
Norway rat, the only mammal be- 
side man to adapt to gravitron. 
Once he almost fell to his death 
when a section of railing turned into 
flaky dust beneath his hand. And 
now he was here again in the 
sparkling palace amidst traceries of 
exquisite perfume. A tiny music 
lilted on the air, almost below the 
level of hearing.

GALAXY 




He saw confusion in her eyes, 
elaborated: “I’m no longer chief of 
mission. They removed me and 
locked me up. I escaped to come to 
you.” 

Regina understood him now, and 
her heart leapt with pleasure. Now 
nothing stood in the way of escape. 
If Mycal no longer had duties in 
Ricardo, nothing would keep him 
here. 

“Why,” she asked. “What hap- 
pened?” 

He glanced aside to avoid her 
eyes. “You see, I. .1 exceeded 
my instructions this morning. I 
asked for you as hostage.” 

“And you shoudln’t have!” 

“I shouldn’t have.” 

“Oh, darling.” 

She hugged and kissed him 
again, dimly aware that she did 
more than merely that required to 
secure his cooperation. 

“I’m in trouble too,” she 
explained, breaking away. “I’ve 
been told to stay away from you. 
It’s my brother, Sidney. I can’t hide 
you — and I can’t stay here either. 
Will you escape with me? The two 
of us? Together?” Hope sparkled in 
her eyes. 

“But how? You? Me? Alone?” 

She nodded eagerly and took his 
hand. 

Bono followed her in a kind of 
daze up the same stairs he had 
mounted the night before with such 
sure anticipation. Everything moved 
loo fast for him. He couldn’t keep 
track. He lagged behind himself, 
trying to catch up. His life had be- 
come a voyage on a mountain 
stream with sudden twists and turns 
and mind-boggling drops and flings. 
Water, rock, embankments. A boil- 



ing, tumbling all around him. He 
was about to abduct Unsler’s daugh- 
ter? At her instigation? To take her 
where? 

She stopped upstairs and pointed 
with a beaming face at two jump 
tubes as if they were statues she had 
Just unveiled. Next to each lay a 
thick, fur-lined parka on the gravel 
path. On each parka sat a yellow 
mask of some sort attached by coil- 
ing lines to tubular devices with 
straps. To wear on the back? Oxy- 
gen? 

“There,” she cried with a note 
of triumph. “I’ve already planned 
our escape.” 



THE BLOCK 

At first she heard the dull mur- 
mur of voices. Then, overlaid 
against that background, she heard 
the echoing fall of footsteps, 
movement. She lay in some sort of 
large place on a kind of narrow cot 
covered by a rough blanket. The 
blanket had been tucked in around 
her, under her feet. Someone had 
removed her shoes. Her head buzzed 
and ached. Nausea troubled her 
stomach. 

Miri opened her eyes and closed 
them again. 

From a spot very high in the ceil- 
ing, bright floodlights blinded. 

She found the spot where mem- 
ory had failed. She had been on a 
feeder street in West Tower’s Top 
Level headed for Regina Unsler’s 
palace. She recalled a swarming of 
grey-clad men, crouched with 
chemguns in their hands. Then had 
come a rush of darkness, a feeling 
as if her eyes were turning inside

out. And then — ^poof! 

Darby Dickens’ energetic voice 
cut through the confused noise 
around her. 

“Up, up, up, you birds,” he 
cried. “Quickly now. You too. Get 
up! Don’t pretend, my noble friend. 
We know when the effect wears 
off.” 

Miri smiled to herself with eyes 
closed. Darby’s voice told her that 
she’d been saved. A hand had 
reached down to free the yellow 
bird. She wiggled an arm from the 
tightly wound blanket and, shading 
her eyes, she sat up to look for 
Frenchy. 

From her immediate right a voice 
said: “Ah, Mrs. French, you’re up. 
Here, let me give you a hand. No 
pains, I hope. Your tube bounced 
about a bit after you lost conscious- 
ness, but we caught you before you 
had a chance to fall.” 

She didn’t recognize the helpful 
young man. His hair was cut 
bangs-style across his forehead. He 
wore a button on his jump suit col- 
lar, and she recognized a manage- 
ment intern. He pulled her up from 
the cot. She stood for a second in 
her stockings, unsteadily, leaning 
on his arm, smiled her thanks. 
Then, eyes still shaded from the 
glare, she looked around for Frenchy. 

The stadium. She had been here 
before for official dances when the 
ceiling had had a low-slung belly of 
festoons and a band had played on a 
stand. Proctor danced with Mrs. 
Sedlig in her memories — the pale 
secretary blushing crimson from the 
honor. Now she saw only BTA staf- 
fers packed on bleachers. A chop- 
ping block with an axe in its center 
(it resembled an upside down check 

96 



mark) dominated the middle of the 
room. What was it for? To her right 
Darby marched among supine no- 
bles laid out in rows nudging now 
this, now that flame with the tip of 
a brightly polished boot. One by 
one the flames came to their feet, 
groggy, confused. 

She didn’t see Frenchy anywhere. 

Several thoughts went through 
her mind more or less at once. She 
wondered what this was all about — 
the crowd, the block, her captors on 
the floor. The crowd scene stirred 
her artistic interest. The room 
suggested drama — a scene for a 
mural. At the same time she won- 
dered where Frenchy was. Why had 
they assigned a trainee to wait on 
her? 

“Quick, now, gentlemen,” 
Darby called. “We can’t be nap- 
ping all night. Let’s move.” 

Miri said to the trainee: “Is my 
husband here?” 

“No, ma’m.” 

“Where is he?” 

“He went out with another party, 
Mrs. French. They haven’t re- 
turned.” 

The intern avoided her eyes. Miri 
grew troubled. How many groups 
searched Ricardo to find her? Didn’t 
they communicate? 

“What party did he go with?” 
she asked. 

“He went to the embassy to get 
you — of course, you weren’t 
there.” 

“And?” 

He ducked her eyes, but she 
stared until he answered. 

“Mr. French broke away from 
his party and went off alone.” 

Miri sucked in her breath. She 
had had that dark premonition. He 

GALAXY 




hadn’t listened to her. He hadn’t 
counted to ten, like she had asked 
him. 

You are sound, secure, calm, and 
unafraid. She sent the telepathic 
message with the strongest pulse 
she could muster. She hoped that 
he’d be calm enough to receive her 
message. I am well and safe, she 
signalled. You are calm, reason- 
able, confident, courageous . 

“Mrs. French,” the trainee said. 
He took her by an elbow. “Now 
that you’re up, may I take you to an 
apartment we’ve set aside? Mr. 
Proctor has instructed me to — ” 

“No,” she broke in. “I’ll wait 
here for my husband.” 

Yes, she’d wait. She’d wait until 
French returned. 

The intern still held her elbow. 
He tugged at it, clearly agitated and 
embarrassed. “Ma’m I. .” 

She turned her head and looked 
at him. 

‘‘I wouldn’t advise that you 
watch this.” He gestured vaguely. 

She followed his gesture and saw 
the chopping block. “Why?” 

“All right, flames and sparks,” 
Dickens bawled to the nobles; she 
saw him march up and down in 
front of the figures in white; they 
all stood, finally. “Out of your 
robes, all of you. Undress. Quickly. 
Down to your Adam’s costume. 
Move] We haven’t got all night.” 

Undress? Strange. 

“What’ll happen?” Miri asked. 

The youngster glanced away, 
embarrassed. “Ma’m. .it’ll be 
harmless, but it won’t be pretty. I 
urge you. .” 

She shook her head. “I want to 
see.” 

She threw off a pulse of an- 



noyance. Why couldn’t women wit- 
ness ugly scenes. At the same time, 
she felt a stir of suspicion. This was 
more than a rescue operation, and 
BTA didn’t want her to watch. 
Well, she would! 

“Hey, you. Get with it, man. I 
told you to strip.” 

Darby addressed a swarthy man 
Miri knew as Clafto Meyer. She 
thought: We’re all connected. She 
remembered a small commission 
from the Meyer family she had re- 
ceived some years ago, brought by 
a senior servant of that household. 
It had been for a series of inlays for 
wooden furniture. Since then she 
had graduated into portraits. 

To her right Clafto experienced a 
rare emotion. He felt genuine, 
gut-wrenching terror. Like flashes 
of successive lightning in a dark 
and fearful landscape, his mind fed 
him information and insights. BTA 
had dared to touch him! Clafto 
Meyer, the plastosteel heir, the 
flame nearest to the Fire! Yet now a 
black man yelled at him in a 
tone. Clafto didn’t understand 
the man. His ears buzzed. But he 
heard the arrogance. 

“You,” the black yelled. A 
finger pointed. It came out of a 
dark fist at the end of a dark arm. 
Around the dark wrist glowed a 
golden watch. “Get. out of that 
robe. I won’t tell you again.” 

Clafto understood now and burst 
into protest. “What is this? Who’re 
you to tell me to undress. .” 

He heard the death of his own 
protest. Around him flames and 
sparks were more compliant. Some 
already stood naked with hands up 
front to shield themselves from 
scrutiny. 



HELIUM

“All right, men,” the black man 
yelled. “Strip him.” 

Miri watched the ensuing, feeble 
struggle as BTA men overcame 
Clafto and stripped him naked. 
They left him only socks and boots. 
The naked form. .so noble in art. 
Here nudity was used as a 
weapon — to underline BTA’s 

superiority. 

She saw movement from the 
comer of her eye. A man — he was 
unusually tall, muscular, bald, and 
naked to the waist — approached the 
chopping block. She turned her full 
attention to him, plagued by an in- 
decision in her mind: Was this an 
elaborate psychodrama staged for 
the benefit of the flames? Or was 
this more? 

Raisin-balls, she thought, but 
couldn’t place the reference. 

Behind the bald, half-naked man 
came a camera on wheels. The 
camera circled the block until the 
technician operating it found his 
angle. Miri now became aware of 
other cameras spotted about the 
stadium and aimed at various spots. 

The bald man worked the deep- 
sunk axe out of the wood. He tested 
its weight in a hand, took a step 
back. He lifted the axe far back 
over his shoulder, and with a loud 
cry — “Haay!” he cried — he sank 
the blade into the wood. 

Miri glanced at Clafto to see his 
reaction. The handsome, hairy man 
was fearful. His eyes shifted inces- 
santly. Three men held him, two on 
each side and one in the back. She 
found this excessive because Clafto 
didn’t resist. Did they expect that 
he would. .later? 

This can’t be real, Clafto 
thought. / don’t believe this. Why 

98 



the butcher block? What signifi- 
cance the axe-wielding gesture, the 
loud cry of the man? 

“Mrs. French, I really think you 
should leave now.” 

Miri shook her head. She was 
tense with expectation. She thought: 
Surely they don’t intend to harm these 
nobles!? Even Proctor wouldn’t 
resort to low barbarism? Or would 
he? Could this be a practical joke? 
He is said to be quite a practi- 
cal. No. She doubted it. 
This — whatever this was — was more 
than just a joke. 

“All right, men,” she heard 
Darby call, “take him to the block. 
The rest of you, look lively. Don’t 
let these birds panic.” 

Clafto’s guards began to move 
him forcibly toward the block. She 
heard him cry: “Hey, what is 
this — Stop! You can’t do this. I 
swear I’ll. .” His voice disap- 
peared in grunting struggle. 

Miri felt the man’s hysteria. It 
spread like an acid stench on the 
air, choked the throat. Clafto 
wouldn’t walk and had to be car- 
ried. He struggled all the way to the 
block where the axe-man hefted his 
weapon with a satisfied but eerie 
look on his face. 

It’s like a scene from a cheap vis- 
ishow. 

Meanwhile other BTA staffers 
had swarmed out to take up posi- 
tions on either side of the naked 
formation. 

Miri watched in growing disgust. 
Clafto’s guards, now joined by two 
others, forced the noble up against 
the block in such a way that his 
genitals lay on the rough surface of 
the wood. Four men held the madly 
struggling Clafto. The fifth crossed 

GALAXY 




opposite and rudely grabbed the 
man’s parts. He stretched them out 
a little, away from the body. Claf- 
to’s yell of pain shot through Miri 
as if it were her own. The 
chemblast nausea rose up in her 
again. Degradation in the venerable 
stadium. Savage rite. Disease of the 
Cosmic Mind. 

“All right, you,” Dickens now 
called to the naked nobles. “Turn 
around. You won’t have to see this. 
You’ll feel it soon enough. Go on, 
turn.” 

The nobles turned. Miri saw her 
own disbelief mirrored in their 
faces. But why did Darby make 
them turn? 

“Mrs. French, please. .” 

“Please, for God’s sake, people, 
this is. .this. .oh, God, let me 
go!” 

Miri’s eyes were on Clafto’s 
face. She dared not look down at 
the man’s stretched genitals. She’d 
had no idea that the organ could be 
pulled so far from the body. A great 
burst of sympathy for the man went 
out from her to him, so patently 
fragile and human now — he who 
had chased Frenchy and her yester- 
day (was it only yesterday?). 

Darby turned and signaled to the 
bald man. The bald man nodded. 
He lowered his axe blade over Claf- 
to’s genitals in the way of a man 
taking aim. The he stepped back. 
Clafto made one last effort to get 
away, but the pain restrained him. 
The bald man swung his axe back 
over his shoulder. 

Miri turned away. She couldn’t 
watch this. The bald man’s loud 
“Haay,” Clafto’s piercing scream, 
and the dull report of blade on 
wood all came simultaneously.

Head still averted, Miri said to 
the pleasant intern: “Take me 
away. Now.” 

“But, Mrs. French,” he now 
protested, “you don’t under- 
stand. .” 

“I understand,” she said flatly. 
“Take me away.” 

Clafto’s momentary swoon re- 
ceeded. He had almost lost con- 
sciousness under the brutal impact 
of emotion that had enveloped him. 
His eyes had gone black. Now he 
was back again and he felt release. 

He felt. .release?! 

The pain in his genitals was gone 
or less intense. He opened his eyes, 
bent his head. He was still whole! 
The axeblade sat embedded in the 
wood of the block, but it was a 
long way from his exposure, on the 
other side of the sawed-off stump. 
Two men were hurriedly smearing a 
red liquid on the wood from little 
bucket-like containers. 

His captors hustled him out of the 
room. He went willingly. He was 
halfway down some kind of hall 
when the next man’s loud screams 
echoed through the corridor. His 
guards pushed him into a room. 
Behind a desk sat a man in a grey 
jump suit. The room was empty 
save for that desk and a chair. 

“Here, put these on,” the man 
said, pointing to a blue jump suit, 
crumpled underwear, and a white 
robe on the chair. Clafto recognized 
his own clothing. Gladly, hurriedly, 
he dressed. 

“Now understand this,” the man 
said. “BTA won’t be harrassed by 
flames or sparks or anyone. No 
more killings and attacks. Re- 
member this well and pass it on. 
Next time the axe will be right on 

100 



target. Take him away.” 

Men took him to his jump tube in 
a garage. They watched him until 
he had cleared a guard booth and 
had entered the movebelt. 

Clafto spurted away at maximum 
speed, a hollow sensation in his 
stomach. Proctor had dared the ul- 
timate humiliation. It could only 
mean that the rumors were true and 
that revolution was brewing. No, 
more than that. Revolution had suc- 
ceeded, else how would Proctor 
dare. 



MEMORIES OF NARSES 

Proctor sat behind his desk and 
watched the action in the stadium 
over the same visimonitor that had 
shown him Ecofreak’s entrance into 
Ricardo a few days ago. 

His face was pensive, with a 
touch of puzzlement. Below the 
hardened surface of his every-day 
consciousness, something stirred. 
He almost had it, but it kept eluding 
him. It was a memory that would 
explain, he knew, why Operation 
Hairy-Scary pleased him so — 
despite the risk, despite its terrible 
timing, its potentially high political 
costs. But the memory wouldn’t 
hatch. 

A buzz on his communicator 
made him reach out. The voice of 
the night-duty secretary told him 
that Clemmens waited outside to 
give a report. He told the man to 
send Clenunens in. Simultaneously 
he turned down the audio on the 
visiset, and the loud screams faded 
away. 

Clemmens came in and sat down 
with a sheaf of scriptoplast in his 

GALAXY 




hand. Somehow his presence under- 
lined with a vengeance French’s ab- 
sence. 

“We still don’t have word of 
your chief, do we?’’ Proctor asked. 

“No, sir.’’ 

The men exchanged glances. The 
glances said: We both know Rivera 
French, and both of us are worried. 

“Where do you think he is?’’ 

“I’d hate to speculate,’’ Clem- 
mens answered. 

“Go ahead — speculate.’’ 

“He’s looking for her. That’d be 
my guess. And you know where he 
is likely to look.’’ 

“Sidney’s domain.’’ 

“Yes, sir.’’ 

Proctor shook his head. It was 
more of an incantatoiy denial than a 
conviction. “Surely not. The man 
can’t be such a fool. Madness. 
Sheer madness.’’ 

Clemmens made a wry face. His 
expression suggested that French 
was capable of madness. 

Proctor deliberately dismissed the 
subject with a wave of his hand. He 
thought: Unfortunately I've set him 
a very poor example with this oper- 
ation. Also madness. Aloud he said: 
“Let’s talk about silcoplast. What 
does it look like? Can we produce 
the parts?” 

Clemmens passed scripto over the 
desk. “The first item is a produc- 
tion schedule,” he said, keeping his 
tone cool and businesslike. It was 
not his role to discuss policy with 
Proctor. French would do that. 
When French returned. //French re- 
turned. “We’ve worked it out care- 
fully and checked with all the pro- 
ducers. We had to get some plant 
managers out of bed, but it’s hard 
information.” 



Proctor studied the sheet, looked 
up. “Four days? You can deliver in 
four days?’ ’ 

“Yes, sir.” 

Proctor nodded. “And these other 
items?” 

“Draft contracts and procurement 
orders. I didn’t bring the specs and 
the drawings. I don’t suppose 
you’re interested.” 

Proctor shook his head. He took 
the production schedule off the pile 
and passed the other items back to 
Clemmens. I’ll keep the schedule; I 
don’t need these things.” 

Clemmens made ready to rise. 
“Stay a second,” Proctor said. 
“What’s your opinion? Are these 
really oscillation control devices?” 
“I’m sure of it, sir.” 

“But French tells me that Ful- 
bright disagrees.” 

“He does indeed, sir.” 

“Don’t you respect Fulbright’s 
judgement?’ ’ 

“I’m not in a position to judge 
the professor’s competence. 
Negotiator. I’m just a simple en- 
gineer. But even genius can some- 
times be wrong.” 

“Very well, Fred.” Proctor 
scratched behind his ear. Then he 
looked at Clemmens. “And suppose 
you’re right. Can you defeat the de- 
vice?” 

“I don’t know, sir. How can you 
defeat something unless you know 
how it works?” 

“But you could try?” 

“We can try, of course. .” 
“Then try,” Proctor said, nod- 
ding. “Figure out some minor 
change that’s difficult to detect and 
work it into the plans.” 

/ only need a day, he thought. 
One day.

“Will do,” Clemmens said, and 
this time he rose. 

Proctor nodded to him. “Thanks, 
Fred. Do the best you can. If we 
have to, we could deliver,” he 
summed up, “in four days.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Very well, Fred. Your people 
did a good job.” 

Clemmens left and Proctor turned 
on the audio again. At the moment 
the camera down in the stadium fo- 
cused on another group of naked 
flames. That picture suddenly 
triggered the memory, a long for- 
gotten resentment, and Proctor 
knew why he had indulged himself 
with Hairy -Scary. 

The memory moulded Proctor’s 
face into a mask of slightly cruel 
glee. 

He remembered it all now. 
His mind returned to New Ivy 
League — Nivylee, as the students 
called it. The school of schools. 
Cradle of leaders. Nivylee — the 
elite college that claimed uninter- 
rupted descent from the best pre- 
structure universities. That school 
had accepted him on a scholarship 
for his uncontested brilliance, one 
of a dozen mid-level men admitted 
to the place. He studied with the 
fathers of the men who now 
screamed down there in the 
stadium, one after the other, each 
stupidly convinced that he’d lose his 
manhood. 

The rich boys called him Narses 
Castratus after some obscure official 
of the Dimmest Ages, the Roman 
Time, which still inspired Very Big 
youths bent on the emulation of past 
decadence. He had a nickname 
which he refused to recall. When 
forced to disrobe with others for the 

102 



weekly physical education class, 
compulsory in the first year, the 
fathers of these worthless flames 
had chanted in the showers to spite 
him: “Not a dong, not a ding, not 
even a dingeling.” 

He had been a fat boy, his physi- 
cal development retarded by gravit- 
ron, a not unusual phenomenon. In 
the second year his hormones began 
to flow. The butter of his moon- 
face melted away, revealing the hard 
rock of his chin. The pillows of lard 
beneath his eyes disappeared, giving 
free range to his hard, cold eye. By 
the third year he manipulated tutors 
and men and virtually ran the col- 
lege. He graduated with honors. But 
he came from mid-level and had to 
enter the civil service at the lowest 
rung of the ladder, while his 
classmates went right to the top of 
agencies and industries. 

Proctor smiled and shook his 
head- 

All that lay thirty years back. He 
had risen once more and stood on 
the brink of another graduation. He 
could afford a slight indulgence, 
risk or no risk. If the greater 
scheme failed, at least he would 
have had this satisfaction. If it suc- 
ceeded. .why then he might think 
of other things to do with his 
erstwhile humiliators and their pre- 
cious sons. 

Now that he had found the mem- 
ory, he lost interest in the activity 
below. He turned off sound and pic- 
ture and fell to studying the produc- 
tion schedule. 

Four days to produce the silco- 
parts, he mused. Four days. The 
basic schema that he had been turn- 
ing this way and that all day began 
to crystallize in his mind. He would 

GALAXY 




try it. He’d attempt to deal with 
Bono, an exchange of treasons. He 
would deliver the components, 
flawed components, to be sure. And 
Ecofreak, in turn, would deliver the 
illegal Interdiction that would 
catapult Proctor to ultimate power. 
And as soon as he was in power, 
the negotiations would take on 
another character altogether. He was 
not an Accommodationist, no bleed- 
ing heart, had no fear of using mis- 
siles, and Ecofreak would learn 
that. Perhaps he would explode a 
bomb or two just to show them that 
the sil-parts didn’t work. 

He sighed tiredly. One last item 
and then he’d try to snatch a few 
hours of genuine sleep. He reached 
for the dictation button laid into the 
surface of his desk. 

“A letter to Mr. Mycal Bono, 
Chief of Mission, Helium, the Eco- 
freak embassy, and so forth, the text 
is as follows.” 

He paused, thinking. 

“Dear Mr. Bono,” he began. 
“Union has analyzed Ecofreak’s ini- 
tial package, and we’re pleased to 
give you the following reaction. 
Paragraph. Your demand for various 
products and components, including 
the communications switches made 
of welded silcoplast, appear accept- 
able.” He paused, thinking. 

“Comma,” he continued, “pro- 
vided that you immediately with- 
draw your demand for Miss Regina 
Unsler, the Unifier’s daughter, 
and. .enter with us into serious 
negotiations about various demands 
that we have. Paragraph.” 

He paused again, then went on. 
“Your demand for plastosteel is ex- 
cessive in the extreme and cannot 
be honored. However, we shall be 



pleased to sit down and discuss a 
reasonable level of shipment. Para- 
graph. Technical analysis shows that 
the electronic components you de- 
sire can be delivered to the four 
Staging Stations. .” He paused 
and glanced down at the delivery 
schedule. “The six staging Stations 
specified in your demand,” he cor- 
rected, “soon after we sign an ac- 
ceptable Helium deal. Paragraph.” 
Was that too direct? He decided to 
let it stand for the moment. “We 
look forward to a timely response 
and stand ready to resume talks 
immediately provided that you can 
sincerely enter into the spirit of the 
points raised in this letter. Should 
you be unable to do so, I regret that 
we shall be forced to take appro- 
priate measures to secure our well- 
being. Very truly yours, etc. etc.” 
Proctor replayed the tape and de- 
cided that some editing was re- 
quired. The text was too obvious 
and had to be cast in a more subtle 
form. But he’d do that in the morn- 
ing. For the moment it would do. 
He’d sleep on it. 



VII 

PRAYER ON THE PYRAMID 

A leaden sky obscured the sun. 
Wind blew across the endless 
mutagrass driving speckles of icy 
rain before it. The wide plain was 
almost completely empty except for 
a chain of uniform hills spaced one 
kilometer apart. The remains of an 
ancient highway could be seen in 
spots linking the hills. To the left of 
this chain, looking east, stood the 
activist camp — a crowding of tents 
with horse corrals on one side and a 



HELIUM 



103 




formation of helicopters on the 
other. 

On the flat top of one of the hills 
a group of tribesmen stood in 
clumps approximating a circle 
around Tack. He sat in Sie center in 
the classic meditation pose. The 
men were silent and endured the 
rain with stoic expressions. 

Only Ted Fannin was out of the 
rain. He stood in the narrow obser- 
vation room of a high wooden to- 
wer that had been erected here re- 
cently. He felt the cold as keenly as 
the others. He shook his arms and 
ran in place to warm himself. On 
the window sill before him lay 
binoculars through which, from 
time to time, he observed the dis- 
tant camp, on the look-out for sig- 
nals that might be sent to recall 
Tack from his morning prayers. 

Fannin had a good idea why the 
meditation lasted longer than usual. 
The news of Bono’s defection had 
spread from lip to lip the night be- 
fore. That, combined with Jonny’s 
other troubles, gave the chief lots of 
things to pray about. 

Fannin wondered, at the moment, 
whether or not it might be time to 
head for home. He’d have no trou- 
ble fixing it so that he’d make the 
mail-run to Wellhead. Then he 
could become ‘sick’ in Wellhead. 
And then, a little later, he might 
send word that he had gone home to 
recuperate. 

He ran in place, shaking his 
arms, feeling a little warmer now. 
His breath worked hard. 

In the center of the circle. Tack 
wrestled with the Lord but made no 
progress. 

He had awakened in a boiling 
rage, filled with hot, carnal desire. 

104 



He had kicked his servant across the 
tent — ^the rascal had overslept and 
Tack had almost missed the dawn. 
Then he’d come out here to com- 
mune with Him, seeking a clear 
nod, a firm assurance. Did He-Up- 
There care as much about the Plan 
as Jonny Tack? 

The Lord wouldn’t answer. Tack 
labored, worked. But he didn’t hear 
the Lord. Snakes surrounded and 
encoiled him — writhing doubts, de- 
sires, and uncertainties. 

Listen, Lord, Hear me! Tack 
pleaded. 

I’m surrounded by traitors. They 
violate your law. They disobey your 
servant. 

He felt the prayer in his guts, a 
strong emotion. But his face was 
stiff and masked his feelings. The 
wind drove particles of ice against 
his skin where they turned into 
speckles of moisture. 

Why did they do it? Tack won- 
dered. Why the opposition. What 
had happened to the fervent com- 
mitments of a month ago? 

Fear, selfish fear! 

He recalled an elder Gulfrat’s 
statement of the night before: “The 
venture is doomed to failure. Your 
own man betrayed you. It’s a bad 
sign. The Lord won’t smite all those 
millions. There must be right- 
eous among them. Give up the plan, 
Jonny. Secure the parts, but give 
up the madness.’’ 

Then the man came forward and 
spread out a map of Gulfrat’s ter- 
ritories. 

“Look at this, Jonny. Those are 
my people. What if Union betrays 
us? What if the parts don’t work? A 
few missiles from Husten will de- 
stroy us.” 



GALAXY 




Tack hit the table with a fist. 
“Why? Why have you changed 
your mind? You swore.” 

“We swore, but we’ve thought 
about it since.” 

Lord, he prayed, give me a sign. 
Give me a sign so I can rally these 
people. Show me your grace. 

In the tower Fannin stared out 
over the landscape. Yellow out- 
croppings of rock broke up the 
monotony of silvery mutagrass mov- 
ing under windlash like the sea. 

He wondered what the pyramids 
might have looked like in ancient 
days. 

He imagined them silvery, re- 
flecting sunlight. And a constant 
traffic of tank trucks would have 
moved down below on the ancient 
highway carrying toxic wastes for 
perpetual deposition in these struc- 
tures now covered with dirt and 
overgrown with vegetation. 

The ancients were gone, but the 
wastes were still here — drums of it, 
sacks of it, pools of hazard — 
liquids, solids, and hot stuff that 
would still be there when man had 
gone from the face of the earth. 

Plutonium has a half-life of 
twenty-four thousand years, he 
mused. 

For a moment he tried to calcu- 
late how much plutonium would be 
left a hundred thousand years from 
now if you started with a ton of the 
stuff at the time of LNW-XIII. He 
gave up the effort as too tedious. 

Instead he mused about the 
enormities radiation had created. 
This area still produced mutants that 
lived a few generations before na- 
ture wiped them off the boards. 

Near Santlu crater he’d once seen 
a horse so tiny you could hold it in 



your hand. Around Liberal in Mo- 
kan people said lived a creature 
with a heart so big it squirted 
poisoned blood to catch its prey. 
Then there was a curious bird with 
one enormous right wing and an in- 
significant left that flap-flew back- 
wards. Near here he’d seen a feath- 
ered turtle that — 

Motion from the direction of the 
camp now drew his eye. 

Straw-hatted Symbimuts marched 
toward helicopters. 

Another group deserting the strict 
constructionist paradise? 

He watched the Symbies through 
his binoculars. Several ferns walked 
in the group, out in the open, un- 
abashed. 

Fannin chuckled. He had guessed 
all along that Jonny’s rules weren’t 
being observed. Some tribes had 
women in the camp. And those that 
didn’t jutted fem-folk from mutie 
settlements in the rad belts. They 
came from all over in the night and 
sold themselves for salt and trin- 
kets. 

I should be so lucky, Fannin 
thought. 

He imagined a wild fern scratch- 
ing on the canvas of his tent. Well, 
Fannin had a ring or two ready for 
that eventuality. He too had sworn 
the Pact of Chastity, but on occa^ 
sion you could close an eye. Best if 
you did close the eyes. Some of these 
ferns were weird — eight nipples 
down each side of the belly, faces 
without noses, just little holes all 
covered with hair. But who gave a 
damn in the dark. 

Mutant slaves loaded the Symby 
copters. Then Fannin saw blades 
begin to turn. Three big birds rose 
with a dull, whirring sound and 



HELIUM 



105 




curved away, away to Socal. 

Tack also heard the far-away 
whirring chop of copters and almost 
opened his eyes. But he resisted the 
urge. 

Is that your answer, Lord? he 
asked with an undertow of bitter- 
ness. Is that your message? More 
defections? 

Five tribes had already deserted. 
If more left, who would mass 
around the structures to wipe out 
the remnants of structure life? 

It seemed to him almost as if fate 
conspired to ruin the glorious 
plan — the plan his father had formu- 
lated, for whose achievement he’d 
sacrified the family wealth. Herd af- 
ter herd of Tack cattle had been 
sold to support those scientists in 
Kay see. 

For a second Tack yielded to an 
angry thought. 

He would succeed without the 
other tribes. He’d march with his 
own army down the coasts of 
America, liquidating the remnants. 
And he’d subjugate the tribes as 
well, one by one. 

The sound of copters faded away. 

Who was it this time? Planet- 
friends? Peacefreak? Gulfrats? The 
word about Bono’s defection had 
leaked out. He’d find the man 
who’d done the leaking and lock the 
bastard in this pyramid to eat of 
arsenate of lead and drink the milk 
of chlorinated hydrocarbons. 

Tack stopped himself. This was 
no way to meditate. He’d have to 
calm his mind. 

In the tower Fannin hopped 
around once more beating his arms 
against his chest. Wind whistled in 
through the cracks of the tower. Af- 
ter a while he stopped and went 

106 



back to the window. He saw that 
Tack had risen, stood now where 
he’d sat. His blond horsetail of hair 
hung down dark yellow, wet with 
rain. Fannin gathered his binoculars 
and raced down the stairs. But 
when he got down. Tack still hadn’t 
moved. 

Tack tried hard not to see the de- 
legates. He hated them for the 
doubts they held. How could they 
doubt him? How could they reject 
the prophesies! 

He reached for the Crestmore bi- 
ble on his belt. He’d try one more 
time. He had to get guidance, one 
way or another. In meditation he 
had seen only conspiracies — and 
her, Regina’s rutty voluptuousness 
had confused him with moist 
memories. 

He’d open the bible at random 
and see what the book would say. 

From the shelter of the door, 
Fannin saw the gesture. Tack’s fin- 
gers fanned the pages of the book, 
which was a bad sign. The dele- 
gates would see Jonny’s indecision, 
his telltale reliance on the super- 
natural. Fannin wondered how soon 
he might head out for Wellhead and 
get sick. 

Tack waited for the spirit’s 
prompting as his fingers moved. He 
felt the impulse and let the book fall 
open. He lifted it and read the verse 
where his thumb had come to rest. 

“Mercy is sweeter in the mouth 
than justice.” 

Tack slammed the book shut and 
let it drop down on its silver chain. 
Goddamned, he thought. God- 
damned! The line gave no guidance. 
Of late he’d gotten such verses by 
the score. He wanted to open the 
book to one of the many instructive 

GALAXY 




stories — the Chicago Seven, say, or 
the Tale of Manson. Instead he got 
chapters loosely transferred from the 
Biblibooks. 

He glanced up at the grey sky. 
Lord, you’re no help! I'll have to 
act without you. 

His errors would be the Lord’s 
not his. He had asked and he 
couldn’t be blamed. Damnation. A 
man worked, busted his ass — but 
He didn’t care. Sometimes Tack 
was sure that He wasn’t there at all. 
Everything up above and down be- 
low was nothing more than sky and 
rock and mutagrass. Tack wished it 
were so. But then, again, things 
sometimes happened that he 
couldn’t explain. 

Disappointed, he started for the 
camp. Freckled Fannin came toward 
him with a grin, but he scowled at 
his aide, and the man fell back. Be- 
hind Fannin came the delegates. 

They went down the steep slope 
of the pyramid in the involuntary 
quickstep forced by the gradient and 
then in long strides across the wet 
mutagrass toward flags flapping 
moisture laden in the wind in the 
distance. 

Tack was halfway to the camp 
when a figure slipped out between 
tents and ran toward them. The man 
held something yellow in his hand. 

Tack grew alert, almost joyous. 
Action! Something to read, some- 
thing to do. Perhaps guidance came 
from another source. The Lord’s 
ways were strange. 

The man reached him, stopped, 
and gasped once or twice, out of 
breath. He handed Tack three sec- 
tions of cable, said: “A message 
from Dart, Chief. Thought you’d 
want to see this right away.” 



Tack read the text of the letter 
Dart had just sent from Union. 
His heavy mood gave way to 
buoyant elation as he read. He 
glanced up at the sky briefly — to 
show the Lord that he understood. 
Here was the answer. They had 
succeeded without even trying. 
Union stood ready to deliver the parts 
for an almost meaningless conces- 
sion. Drop the hostage demand. 
Tack felt like laughing. The strategy 
had worked despite Regina’s sub- 
stitution for Sidney. 

The second part of the report 
dealt with Bono’s escape. Tack’s 
face clouded, but this mishap 
couldn’t obscure his gladness. Bono 
would be caught — or he’d die in the 
crash of Ricardo. 

Tack turned to the waiting run- 
ner. “Is he standing by?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

Tack came about and faced the 
delegates. His eyes swept the 
soaked figures, their hair matted 
down, leather tunics unevenly black- 
ened by rain. Behind them towered 
the pyramid. Tack’s lip curled. 

“Gentlemen, the doubts that you 
all harbor about my competence are 
groundless. We’ve had a break- 
through. The sil-parts might be in 
our hands within the week.” 

He turned to Fannin and beck- 
oned him near. Walking forward, 
he said: “Fannin, I’ll move my 
immediate headquarters north this 
morning. I want to be near when 
Ricardo falls. Make all the ar- 
rangements.” 

“Yes, sirl” Fannin cried. For the 
moment he’d postpone getting sick. 
It looked as if Tack might win after 
all.

In other words. I’ve just come than on the technologies them- 
from the annual meeting of the selves. Although there was plenty 

108 





of enthusiasm, there was as much 
concern with what technology can 
do to us as for us. 

Secondly, Big Science is more 
open-minded, possibly as a result of 
the Velikovsky Affair. There was 
no fanfare and no special an- 
nouncement, but Cleve Backster got 
his hearing. 

Backster is best known as the 
ex-CIA polygraph expert who 
claims that plants have ESP and can 
react not only to threats, but also to 
termination of other forms of life. 
Backster reported as early as 1968 
that he had connected electro- 
encephalograph (EEG) or “brain- 
wave” recording equipment to vari- 
ous plants. When he thought of 
burning one of the wired-up plants, 
it reacted to his very thought by 
giving out agitated electrical re- 
sponses. 

Backster also reported that the 
plant reacted when brine shrimp 
were killed in boiling water. 

Few biophysicists took the claims 
seriously. Plants have no central 
nervous system, and it’s hard to see 
where the “brainwaves” come 
from. It’s also hard to see what sur- 
vival value such responses would 
have. However, Backster was not 
laughed off as a crackpot. 

He was invited to participate in a 
panel organized by Yale biologist 
Dr. Arthur Galston. Other scientists 
attempted to replicate Backster’s 
work. 

Professor Edward Gasteiger of 
Cornell reported the results of 



elaborate brine-shrimp-killing experi- 
ments. He also had conducted a 
“plant-killer detection” experiment 
in which some students went into 
the laboratory and burned plants 
alive, while others entered the lab 
and merely stood there thinking nice 
thoughts. 

Various plants in the lab were 
wired up to EEG apparatus. Observ- 
ers in another room attempted to 
identify the “plant killers” by 
watching the EEG responses of 
plants which “witnessed” the life 
termination-by-fire . 

Other AAAS scientists reported 
duplications of Backster’s published 
experiments. As you’ve probably 
guessed, no one got any results 
worth reporting. It wasn’t possible 
to determine which students wore 
“plant killers” and the responses of 
plants to brine shrimp terminations 
didn’t differ from chance. 

The important point was not that 
they failed to get the results — it 
seems unlikely to most people that 
plants really have ESP — but that a 
serious effort was made to investi- 
gate claims that went counter to all 
established theories of plant bio- 
logy. 

Backster had new and previously 
unpublished results to report this 
year: he has attached his EEG sys- 
tems to eggs, yogurt, and sperm, 
and believes they may all have ESP. 
One glass of yogurt, for instance, 
will react when fresh milk is added 
to a glass of “brother” yogurt in 
another room. Sperm give off elec- 




trical brainwaves when the donor 
(also in another room) sniffs an am- 
pule of amyl nitrate. And so forth. 

The members of science press 
corps could hardly contain them- 
selves, but 400 engineers and 
biologists listened to reports of the 
world’s first yogurt-to-yogurt inter- 
communications with absolutely 
straight faces. The contrast to the 
treatment received by Velikovsky 
couldn’t have been greater. 

There was also an entire session 
on parapsychology and psi 
phenomena, and no one was laugh- 
ing; in fact, it was so prosaic as to 
be rather dull. The general attitude 
was that ESP no longer needed dem- 
onstrating, and the question was 
how best it might be studied. 

For example: telepathic com- 
munication is notoriously unreliable. 
At best it operates consistently only 
a little above the level of chance. 
Thus there was a paper on ESP and 
information theory — techniques 
whereby an unreliable channel can be 
made to send reliable data through 
repitition. Accuracies approach 
100% if the message is short 
enough and sufficient time is spent 
sending it. 

Another paper studied interaction 
of alpha wave training and ESP, 
and concluded that learning alpha 
wave control has no significant ef- 
fect on raising ESP performance — 
but, contrariwise, there’s some evi- 
dence that during ESP successes, 
alpha waves are produced. 



A St. John’s professor dealt with 
ethical problems of teaching or 
training psi abilities, while another 
Ph.D. from Santa Barbara de- 
scribed a number of methods by 
which psi talents could be 
“simulated” — in other words, 
faked. 

Aha, one thinks. The typical at- 
titude of the scientist debunker; but 
it wasn’t that at all. There’s so 
much to learn about the real thing 
that there’s no time to waste on 
frauds. 

There are still scientists like Dr. 
John R. Pierce, of course. (Pierce is 
well known in communications 
theory, and also, as JJ Coupling, is 
a science fiction writer of some 
note.) He told me recently that not 
only doesn’t he believe in ESP, but 
he won’t believe it even if they 
prove it to him! There are also a, lot 
more who simply accept psi as a 
field to be studied. Whatever the at- 
titude, no one seems to want to 
suppress either research in ESP or 
publication of the results. 

(Before I leave this topic I feel a 
warning is needed. Although it’s 
generally accepted among many sci- 
entists that ESP and psi are 
genuine phenomena and deserve 
extensive study, there are a lot of 
fraudulent “schools” which sell 
‘ ‘training’ ’ to the gullible. Most claim 
results that they simply can’t ob- 
tain.) 

My third impression was that 
scientists remain technological op- 



110 



GALAXY 




timists: most believe we can solve 
all our problems. They’re not so 
hopeful that we will. 

There was a certain amount of 
gloom in the corridors. A few years 
ago science had public support. 
People were pretty sure that what- 
ever holes we got into, science 
could get us out. The public attitude 
has changed, and it shows on scien- 
tists’ faces. 

There’s a general feeling that the 
public lost confidence at a particu- 
larly unfortunate time. There are 
just too many crises looming on the 
horizon. 

For example: last year, for the 
first time in generations, there was 
an increase in the proportion of 
take-home pay spent for food in the 
United States. World stocks of grain 
are at historic low points. There are 
no reserves. 

Population control is all very well 
for the long run, but in the next few 
years we have only two choices: in- 
creased agricultural production, or 
watch famines. 

Famine is a “natural” phenome- 
non, though one we of the West 
aren’t accustomed to because we’ve 
not only opened new lands, but 
linked the whole of the West with a 
transport system. Drought in one 
region can be compensated for by 
imports of food from another. How- 
ever, except for the past 100 years 
or so, everyone in the West knew 
what “lean years” were. 

We may find out again if we 
don’t do something.

A STEP FARTHER OUT

According to Dr. Sylvan Wittwer 
of the National Academy of Sci- 
ences, we’d better do it fast. The 
oil shortage has reduced fertilizer 
stocks to bare minimums, and with- 
out energy you can’t make more 
fertilizer. 

Yet the sun sends down plenty of 
energy. Legumes regularly fix ni- 
trogen. At the moment plants only 
convert about 1% of solar energy to 
forms we can use, but Wittwer 
thinks that can be increased by an 
order of magnitude. The effect 
would be dramatic. 

If fertilizers could be grown, the 
effect would be the same as con- 
struction of massive solar energy 
converters; why take solar energy, 
turn it into electricity, and use the 
electricity to make nitrates if with a 
little more research we can induce 
plants to do it directly? The major 
beneficiaries would be energy-poor 
countries, but we’d profit greatly 
too. 

Dr. Wittwer wants a Manhattan 
Project on food production, with, as 
a first step, $100 million for a pro- 
gram of research into biological solar 
energy conversion. After all, it’s 
our most renewable and non- 
polluting resource. 

The basic research has been 
done. It’s now largely a matter of 
applying some engineering biology 
to get huge payoffs — and yet it’s 
precisely now that the public loss of 
confidence in science has killed re- 
search into primary methods of food 
production.

That’s not the only high-payoff 
area neglected. For all the money 
spent on environment, we know 
precious little about the real effects 
of cities on the atmosphere. 

For example, it’s known that 
areas downwind of nearly every 
major city in the US receive up to 
20% more summer rain than they 
would if the cities weren’t there. Is 
there a corresponding drought 
somewhere else? How many 
aerosols get to the upper atmos- 
phere, and what effects do they 
have on the ozone layer? 

No one really knows. Those who 
make spectacular claims — as, for 
example, that the ozone layer is be- 
ing destroyed by aerosols, or by 
smog, or by the flatulence of 
cows — get national attention. When 
challenged they can say “prove 
we’re wrong,’’ and get more heati- 
lines. The careful scientists who 
admit we don’t know get neither 
headlines nor a budget. 

Dr. Volker Mohnen of SUNY 
Albany told me that a few million 
dollars invested in learning precisely 
how sulfer dioxide gets from the 
stacks to where it falls as sulfuric 
acid rain would save hundreds of 
millions annually. The study is 
halted, though: no funds. 

And so forth. Some scientific 
disciplines are fat, but many with 
payoffs clearly in the public interest 
are ignored. 

Years ago research scientists had 
a saying: “As long as you’re up, 
get me a grant.’’ The silliest pro- 

GALAXY 




jects were regularly funded. Money 
was shovelled out faster than it 
could be spent. 

A lot was wasted. The Depart- 
ment of Agriculture was particularly 
guilty, with millions spent on such 
exciting studies as “Job Attitudes of 
Supermarket Employees,” a thrill- 
ing expose on how clerks felt about 
their bosses (some liked them, some 
didn’t), and imbecilic surveys on 
whether or not teen-age girls took 
their mothers with them to buy 
clothes. (Some did, some didn’t, 
some didn’t care.) 

This nonsense was rightfully 
parodied by one and all. C. North- 
cote Parkinson gained a national 
reputation by satirizing such studies. 

Those days are gone, and God 
forbid they ever return; but can we 
afford to drop nearly all our re- 
search? 

Thus the curious mixture of op- 
timism and gloom. We have the 
technology to solve the energy 
crisis, but we’re a year closer to the 
crunch, and in no way a year 
further along. The energy panels 
presented the same data this year as 
last. 

Forty percent of our power comes 
from natural gas, and within three 
to five years the natural gas supply 
will drop enormously. We’ve got to 
begin the first demonstration plant 
on coal gassification, although we 
know how to build it. The technol- 
ogy is expensive; but what may not 
having it cost? 



The electrical power shortage is 
going to get progressively worse, 
and everyone projects that by 1985 
we’ll be in red trouble. If we’re to 
use nuclear power to solve that 
problem, the plants have to be 
started now . 

Instead, the nuclear industry is 
liquidating itself. It has become ob- 
vious that fission power plants can’t 
be started — it’s just too easy for 
lawyers concerned about environ- 
ment to throw a brick into the bill- 
ion dollar works. 

There was, in other words, a 
sense of crisis in the halls of the 
AAAS meeting hotel. We seem to 
know what to do and how to do 
it — but nothing seems to be getting 
done. 

Big Science treated Velikovsky 
shamefully 20 years ago; that’s been 
corrected, and new ideas get a hear- 
ing. Science and academia wasted a 
great deal of money in the past; 
that can be prevented in future. 

We stand near the threshold of 
what could be the most exciting 
period of history. If you look fifty 
years ahead you can see ways 
around every problem we face: 
plenty of energy, pollution abated, 
enough food for the world. You can 
find all the optimism you want 
when you look fifty years ahead. 

It’s those who look twenty years 
ahead who wear long faces. 

I hate to end with a downer. Next 
month we’ll assume we get past the 
next fifty years, and look at family 
life in the asteroids. ★

self that I’d even think of letting 
self-interest negate my duty toward 
such a man. His kind is rare, 
Kamon, and you’re proof by exam- 
ple.” 

Kamon bowed elegantly, as ugly 
a creature as she could humanly 
conceive. “Then voice your rescen- 
sion. Baroness. I will pass the mes- 
sage along to the Administers. I am 
sure they would like to prepare the 
next auspices on the basis of such 
information.” 

Administers prepared auspices 
— the seeking of signs in the pat- 
terns of nature — among dozens of 
species associated with the mercan- 
tile consolidations. But none were 
like the auspices of the Aighor 
branch of Hafkan Bestmerit. Anna 
had attended a ceremony once. It 
had sickened her. Still, she had a 
strong inbred abhorrence of judging 
another species by human standards. 
If they wished to sacrifice their 
young and seek signs in their bow- 
els, so be it. Human justice had no 
meaning for the Aighors, nor did 
the justice of their allies, the 
Crocerians. 

“I deny the support of Hafkan 
Bestmerit, and the oath of noninter- 
ference thereby accrued. I will do 
everything in my power to prevent 
you and your associates from strip- 
ping Fairchild of his life and hold- 
ings. And I’ll defend him with all 
the power at my disposal. That’s no 
small force, Kamon.” 

116 



“The Baroness is influential,” 
the Aighor said. He bowed again 
and swung the lower, snake-like 
third of his body into a coil around 
his thorax. “But not omnipotent 
— her weapons are registered. 
And she does have to answer to the 
Combine as all of us do. A most in- 
teresting challenge, however.” 

Anna was fuming at the reminder 
of her limitations. “I’ll warn you 
further. Strike against me and you 
strike against my ally. United 
Stars. Hafkan Bestmerit, I under- 
stand, is extremely interested in es- 
tablishing stronger relations with 
use. You may alienate your own 
allies. You’re sitting above a dark, 
dark singularity, Kamon. Beware of 
losing momentum and falling in.” 
She turned and walked away, 
leaving the Aighor to watch the 
dance, his expression unchanged. 

I " 

l-iADY EDITH FAIRCHILD, after the 
final dance, made her way from the 
floor into the small gilded elevator, 
then up the marble stairs ‘(edged 
with malachite) to her third floor 
bedroom. She looked around with 
her head moving jerk, jerk, nervous 
as a bird. Her hands were trembling. 
Her shoulders slumped and tiny 
rivulets glistened on her cheeks, 
spotting the shiny saffron robe. She 
reached down, pulled up the hem of 
her gown, and sat on the padded 
bar edging the sleep field as she 
undid her shoes. One finger reached 
for the sleep-field button. The bed 



GALAXY 




hummed into action and she fell 
back. Her hair fanned out. 

Disjohn Fairchild stood over her, 
his entrance as quiet as the activa- 
tion of the sleepfield. “What’s 
wrong?” he asked. 

“I saw the Aighor in the hall- 
way,” she said, her voice shaking 
with anger. “They could at least 
have the decency to hide themselves 
while they scheme!” 

“They’re too honest and 
aboveboard for that,” Disjohn said, 
sitting beside her. He looked at the 
ceramic wall mural, then at his 
shelves of old books — all as famil- 
iar to him as his own hands. He had 
no official connections with the 
Combine, but diplomacy worked in 
such devious ways that he’d used 
this office and billet on the Com- 
bine world for twenty years. It was 
more than home, it was the reposi- 
tory of his life’s work. Christ, he 
thought, even my world can’t save 
me. 

But what was there to be im- 
mediately afraid of? The Aighors 
wouldn’t do anything drastic to get 
to him. It would come some un- 
specified time when the opportunity 
presented itself, probably when he 
was called back to Shireport to de- 
liver his personal lectures. Then 
they would declare the cultural in- 
sult and vendetta, commandeer his 
ship, and be done with him cleanly. 
There wasn’t a thing Dallat or Unit- 
ed Stars could do about it. There 
was complex diplomacy involved, 
and he wasn’t so important a figure 



they’d risk the anger of the Com- 
bine. 

Of course, if he could reach 
Shireport safely, there were 
Crocerians who might consent to go 
with him from there — paid, say, in 
trade preference for two years. The 
Aighors wouldn’t touch his ship 
from Shireport to Ansinger with 
their allies aboard. When he deliv- 
ered his lectures at Ansinger, he 
could apply for a United Stars Zone 
immunity. Ansinger was the largest 
use stellar province, ten systems. 
He could transfer his funds, or what 
part of them he could mobilize and 
take with him — not much, he 
knew — and his wife, convert his 
lands and holdings to transferrable 
commodities — trade them for data 
and software, perhaps — and set 
himself up on a terraformed world. 
Buy a continent on Kresham Elak. 
Start a school there. “Get the 
HELL AWAY!” he shouted. His 
wife flinched, shock delaying a 
question. 

“Sorry,” he said. “Thinking 
about alternatives.” But the alterna- 
tives meant the demolition of his 
life as he knew it, and of his 
wife’s. Would she stand for such a 
change? 

“Are they so vindictive that 
they’d kill you for doing such a 
simple thing? Then, why don’t they 
destroy the station and kill its per- 
sonnel as well?” she asked. 

He shook his head. “It’s not that 
simple.” Their reason had to be 
that he had pioneered and pushed 



THE VENGING 



117 




and promoted in every possible way 
the construction of the Precipice 5 
Station, the station studied black- 
hole radio emissions coming from 
the Pafloshwa Rift. He could think 
of no other. 

The Aighors called such emis- 
sions Thrina, and had built up ex- 
tensive obeisance-rituals around 
them. Thus in some way his per- 
sonal action had violated a religious 
or cultural tabu — who could tell 
what human words applied, if 
any? — and he was accountable. 

“They can’t destroy the station,” 
he said. “It’s under United Stars 
jurisdiction now, thanks to Anna 
Nestor. If they attack USC person- 
nel, then the Combine has to inter- 
vene. That would result in severe 
restrictions — which the Aighors 
would have to abide by if they 
wished to survive economically. It’s 
pretty tight from that angle. 

But I’m under Dallat protection, 
and Dallat hasn’t yet signed a full 
agreement with the Combine. It’s 
still a renegade consolidation. Until 
an agreement is signed, the Aighors 
can resort to old pre-human law and 
call a cultural vendetta.” With their 
early half-grasp of human tongues, 
they had called it a “venging.” The 
name had stuck in legal terminol- 
ogy- 

“It’s so damned complicated,” 
Edith sighed, staring at the ceiling. 

“Not really, once you’ve been 
around it for a while.” 

“You almost make it sound 
just.” 

118 



“It kept interspecies conflict to a 
minimum for mellennia before we 
arrived on the scene,” Disjohn said 
quietly. “Roger Bacon was messing 
around with crude lenses when the 
original pact was established.” 

Edith stood up from the sleepfield 
and unhitched her gown in the 
back, letting the folds pile them- 
selves automatically into a tight, 
square pile. At forty she was still 
lovely, he thought — and she had not 
yet begun to rely on juvenates. 

As if she were reading his mind, 
she said, “They don’t have any 
way of staying young.” 

“What?” 

“For all we know, they all die at 
about sixty years of age; they don’t 
have any way to prevent it. Maybe 
that’s why they cling to old reli- 
gions and rituals. Personal survival 
after death, or whatever their equiv- 
alent is.” 

“You mean that maybe they be- 
lieve that what I’ve done blocks 
their chances of surviving after 
death?” 

“They consign their dead to 
black holes, don’t they?” 

“Yes, but before they die. Pil- 
grimage ships of the old and dis- 
eased.” 

“Maybe studying the thing takes 
it out of religion and puts it into 
science. Science still says nobody 
survives after death. Maybe the 
conscious mind will not accept what 
the subconscious — ” 

“That’s archaic,” he said. “And, 
besides, they aren’t even human.” 



GALAXY 




She shrugged and lay back on the 
bed. He crawled in beside her and 
the room lights dimmed and died. 

What if his actions had con- 
demned some of the Aighors to eter- 
nal darkness? He shuddered and 
closed his eyes tight, trying not to 
think, not to empathize. 

Sleep, when it came, was control- 
led, pleasant. 

m 

Kamon gazed briefly at the mes- 
sage spheres on the floor before 
him, then crossed his eyes in irrita- 
tion. This gave him a double view 
of the opposite sides of the oc- 
tagonal room — ceremonial gepter 
knives hung on one wall, over the 
receiver-altar which periodically 
sonically reproduced the radio noise 
of the Thrina; wooden tub next to 
the opposite wall, filled with min- 
eral water super-saturated with sul- 
fur and iodine salts. 

He picked up a sphere and put it 
in the depression in his tape-pad, 
then instructed the little machine to 
record all the successive layers of 
information in linear display. The 
method tasted too much of human 
thought-patterns for his liking, but it 
had been adopted by Hafkan Best- 
merit as a common method of using 
interculture information. It was dis- 
gusting, he thought, that a single 
cultural method of writing — left to 
right, top to bottom — should domi- 
nate information techniques across 
half the galaxy. 



But such was the dominance pat- 
tern of the young humans. 

The pad’s read-out began im- 
mediately. The first message was 
from the Council at Train, the 
Aighor birth- world. The council had 
examined the theological and ethical 
problem of Fairchild and his sac- 
rilege, and supported the conclusion 
of the district priests. Not even 
Fairchild’s alien background and in- 
fluence could exempt him from the 
Venging. 

He had condemned millions of 
Aighors to oblivion after death. He 
had profaned the major region of 
Thrina pilgrimage by treating it as 
an area for rational investigation, 
and not of deep reverence. 

The death-ships could no longer 
drop the assembled dying pilgrims 
below the event horizons of their 
chosen black holes. They would no 
longer experience the redemption of 
Zero, or bathe themselves in the 
source of the Thrina song. Kamon 
seethed with the Venging. He was 
one of those potential pilgrims. 

He had wanted so much to live 
forever.

himself into more than he can

monstration and stared at Anna 
Sigrid-Nestor with large, woeful 
eyes. His jowly face was pale in the 
white light of his reading lamp. 

‘ ‘So I can expect no support from 
use,” Anna said, anger beginning 
to color her face. 

‘‘At the moment — no.” 

‘‘Then what would you sug- 
gest?” 

‘‘For Fairchild, finding his way 
to some immunity zone like An- 
singer. He can seek USC support, 
but only by renouncing his associa- 
tions with Dallat. As I understand 
it, that would mean giving up most 
of his wealth.” 

‘‘Disjohn isn’t so desirous of his 
wealth that he’d rather die than lose 
it, but I’m asking what 7 can do to 
help him.” 

‘‘Keep your nose out of it. Give 
him the advice I’ve given you. But 
stay clear . unless you want 
USC to renounce its connections 
with you.” 

‘‘Kiril, I’ve known you for sev- 
enty years now. We’re about as 
friendly as two old wolves can be. 
You bailed me out of my doldrums 
after the death of my first husband. 
More even, we’re both Abstainers 
and dedicated to our Creed that im- 
mortality is no desirable thing. Yet 
now you tell me you won’t do any- 
thing to help a man who has done 
more good for colonists and the 
consolidations than anyone, Dallat 
associations or no. You’re incredi- 
bly two-faced, I think.” 

‘‘Our ‘Friendliness’ aside, my 



dear, I don’t like your tactics much 
and I never have; you’re too force- 
ful when you should step softly. 
Now is one of those times when a 
good many fragile and important 
things hang in the balance. Do you 
have any idea — you must have, 
you’re no idiot — how difficult it is 
for species to coexist when all they 
have in common is the fact they are 
alive? It’s like standing on tiptoes 
all the time, for all concerned. In- 
volve yourself in this and you might 
start a collapse you can not now 
imagine.” 

She sat in front of his desk, 
hands gripping the edge as if to 
push it aside. Her forearms were 
rigid but her facial expression 
hadn’t changed from the mild, 
grandmotherly smile she’d put on 
when she came in. “Besides,” he 
continued in an undertone, “your 
weapons are registered whenever 
fired, in defense or otherwise, and 
the situation is recorded. We’ll have 
you on the carpet if you do any- 
thing that can even be considered 
other than strictly defensive.” 

“I’ve never been able to figure 
out you bureaucrats,” Anna said. 
“But you’re right about one thing.” 
She sighed, stood up to leave. “It 
hasn’t been much of a friendship.” 

She rode a transit tube beneath 
the modular city, as any pedestrian 
might have — seemingly nothing more 
than just another old woman. In her 
bag were several pictures of young 
men, one of whom attracted her 
very much. She glanced at them 



120 



GALAXY 




several times as she rode, trying to 
lose herself in reverie and allow her 
limbic mind to feel its way through 
to an action. Gut-level thought had 
carried her through crises before. 

She isolated the one photograph 
and tapped it against her cheek as 
she left the tube. She was at an un- 
derground terminal beneath the 
Myriadne starport, largest on Tau 
Ceti II. Shuttles landed and de- 
parted by dozens every hour, bronze 
and silver bullets homing for their 
mother starships. One such bullet, 
small and utilitarian, waited for her 
as she rode a wheeled maneuvering 
tug out to it. In ten minutes she was 
off-planet. 

Disjohn Fairchild was an intelli- 
gent man. He would already be im- 
plementing some of the suggestions 
Karl had made to her. They were 
the only outs he had for the mo- 
ment, with or without her help. She 
calmly analyzed her own reaction to 
the suggestions, watching sun, 
planets and stars form a glittering 
bow around her ship. Then she 
smiled grimly and went to sleep as 
the stars winked out. 

When she came awake three 
hours later, dark still surrounded 
her. It grew muddied and started to 
take on form. There was a queasy 
moment, a tiny shiver, and the 
outer universe returned. Occasional 
wisps of color dotted and vanished 
streamer-like along the forty-five 
degree rotated starbow. 

She began to wonder what 
Kamon had meant by the reminder 



that his kind were mortal without 
choice. Did it have something to do 
with Disjohn? She went to the 
ship’s library to do research. On her 
way, she dropped the photograph 
into an unlabelled chute and told it, 
“Hire him.” They would pick him 
up at Shireport. 

V 

Edith grew tired of the 
viewscreen’s translation of what 
was happening outside the ship. She 
frowned and closed her eyes, trying 
to wipe her mind clear for a mo- 
ment. The books in front of her 
ghosted and darkened, and she 
swam in a small red sea of interior 
designs. 

After a moment, she no longer 
thought in words, and mental im- 
gery came to her clearly. 

Three large, very fast starships all 
moved across hyperspacial 
geodesics toward a common goal. 
They left tracks — she could see 
them in an allegorical fashion — in 
amorphous higher geometries. They 
were aware of each other’s presence 
and direction. By deduction they 
would be aware of each other’s 
purpose. Each carried an individual 
bent on accomplishing one task. 

Edith wondered what Anna 
Sigrid-Nestor’s purpose was, 
beyond friendship. They’d com- 
municated briefly a few hours be- 
fore, and Disjohn had told her to 
leave well enough alone. But Edith 
was sure she wouldn’t. 

Her concentration broken, she

THE VENGING 




opened her eyes and again scanned 
the books. 

One ship carried a being built 
very differently from the masters 
of the other two ships. The being 
wasn’t classifiable in terms of ter- 
restrial biology, having partial as- 
pects of many Earth phyla, as well 
as others totally alien to Sol ID. He 
was called “he” by default — a 
human cultural tendency to view the 
convex sexual form as male. But 
Kamon was neither male nor female 
in the reproductive process of his 
kind. His children (by human stan- 
dards) were not his children. 

His neurological make-up also 
varied wildly from the human, the 
arrangement of his nervous system 
being central rather than dorsal, 
while his brains were positioned in 
three main areas around his 
esophagus. One of his brains was 
an evolutionary vestige, handling 
autonomic and emotive functions. It 
was very powerful in influence de- 
spite its size, and was connected 
with the two other portions by fib- 
ers substantially larger than any 
human nervous connection — 
networks of medullae, each marvel- 
ously complex. 

He could contemplate at least 
four different things at once while 
involved in routine action. Even 
while driven by what humans would 
consider a maniacal obsession an 
Aighgor could think as rationally as 
the calmest of humans. A dangerous 
enemy, hugely motivated and cun- 
ningly reinforced. 



In this match, Kamon indeed had 
the upper hand. He would know ev- 
erything they had planned — with 
benefit of manic certainty and calm 
intellection — and he’d act without 
hesitation — 

“No!” Edith said. Kamon was 
not supernatural. He would have his 
faults, too. They could elude him. 
They could survive him. 

Perhaps Sigrid-Nestor could help 
by distracting him. There was at 
least hope, and perhaps even a good 
chance. So why was she feeling so 
dangerously dark inside, and cold? 

She closed her books and stood 
up slowly from the table, then went 
to join her husband on the bridge. 

“A ship riding proto-geometry 
has three options in case of attack,” 
Graetikin, the Captain, was telling 
Fairchild as she entered. He nodded 
at her and continued. “It can drop 
into half-phase, that is, fluctuate be- 
tween two geometries—” his finger 
lightly sketched an equation on the 
tapas pad — “or drop into status 
geometry, our normal continuum. 
Or it can dispatch part of its mass 
and create pseudo-ships like squid’s 
ink. This happens to some extent 
during any transfer of geometries, 
to satisfy the Dirac corrolaries, but 
the mass loss is on the order of fifty 
or sixty protons, randomly scat- 
tered.” 

“What about protection from 
shields?” 

“Shields only operate in status 
geometry, Disjohn. You should re- 
member that. They’re electromagnet- 



122 



GALAXY 




ic and that implies charge-holes in 
hyperspacial manifolds.” 

‘‘It would have been easier if 
we’d had a few Crocerians,” Fair- 
child said wistfully. But they were a 
pragmatic species. When the ship 
had put in at Shireport, all the 
Crocerians he’d asked had politely 
refused, not wishing to gamble, or, 
if gambling, betting on the Aighor. 

‘‘I’d certainly never fight Aighors 
if I could avoid it,” Graetikin said. 
‘‘1 would avoid it by avoiding hav- 
ing them challenge me.” 

‘‘We’re still taking that risk, 
though.” 

‘‘It’s up to you to estimate that 
risk. Once committed to a pro- 
togeometry vector we can’t back 
down.” 

‘‘How far ahead of us is he?” 

‘‘About four light-hours and 
matching course and velocity.” 

‘‘How much of a jump can we 
get if we take one of these pro- 
togeometries?” 

‘‘He’ll receive signs of our jump 
about a tenth of a second status 
time after we make it. That gives us 
a good hour or two at the other end 
of the pierce.” 

‘‘They might take that as an af- 
front,” Disjohn said, looking at 
Edith. 

‘‘Why, for God’s sake?” 
Graetikin said. ‘‘We’d have to jump 
into some manifold or another any- 
way.” 

‘‘But proto-geometry jumps are a 
waste of energy, unless one wants 
to gain a certain advantage.” Fair- 



child pushed away from the an- 
chored chair and drifted across the 
cabin. ‘‘And if I give any clue that 
I think they’re after me, they’ll in- 
terpret it as a cultural insult. Kamon 
is sharper than I care to think about. 
He won’t miss a trick.” 

Graetikin shrugged and doodled 
an equation among the others on the 
tapas pad. He had been working on 
it in his head for months, unaware 
he was so close to a solution. His 
eyes widened. He had just described 
what the Thrina were in terms of 
physics and mathematics, and how 
they operated. He branched off with 
another equation, and saw that in 
any geometry outside of status — any 
universe beyond his own 
continuum — the Thrina would be 
ubiquitous. He could describe it in 
mathematics, but he couldn’t put it 
into words. That, he idly thought, 
did qualify them for godhood 
somewhat. 

He' would transmit it to Precipice 
5 when he had a chance, and see 
what they made of it. But for the 
moment, it wasn’1 relevant. He 
folded the tapas pad and put it into 
his shirt pocket. 

‘‘We’re four light-days out from 
Shireport, and sixty parsecs from 
the Ansinger systems. We made it 
to Shireport without harassment, 
and that makes me suspicious. So 
far we’ve only been tailed. I ex- 
pected them to act sooner.” 
Graetikin turned around to look at 
Fairchild. ‘‘They’re usually more 
punctual.” 



THE VENGING 



123 




1 . HE AIGHOR captain lay against 
the wall with his throat and triplet 
brain smashed flat. He managed a 
flnal automatic gasp of query before 
Kamon pressed the slammer button 
again and laid his head out. The 
thorax and tail twitched and the 
arms writhed slowly, then all mo- 
tion stopped. Kamon’s mate-of-ship 
huddled against the back of the 
cabin and croaked tightly, regularly, 
her face blood-red with fear. 
Kamon put the slammer down and 
sent his message to the Council at 
Frain. 

“The diplomatic team has caused 
damage to the Venging,” he said. 
The hazy, distorted image of the 
Auspiseer chided him for his vehe- 
mence. 

“They have called for the meet- 
ing at Precipice 5 partly for your 
advantage,’’ the Auspiseer said. 
“The human Fairchild’s ship has 
been notified en route to Ansinger, 
and he cannot refuse.’’ 

“But I have already had several 
chances to attack — ’’ 

“The captain’s reluctance to de- 
stroy the Fairchild ship was part of 
his training. You should have been 
gentler with him.” 

“He is of the governing breed. 
They’ve become almost human in 
the past centuries.” 

“The Council allowed the meet- 
ing at Precipice 5 to be called for a 
number of reasons. For one, it 
makes our relations with the hu- 
mans easier temporarily. And for 

124 



another, it puts you in a better posi- 
tion should the discussions be un- 
successful. So the Council cannot 
discount your premature release of 
Captin Liiank, without benefit of 
pilgrimage. Your mission has now 
become one of self-immolation 
upon completion.” 

“The release of Fairchild will 
sanctify the Rift Thrina, and I will 
take my end there.” 

“So be your course of action, 
wise and good.” 

“But I have lost the Fairchild 
ship now because of the Captain’s 
reluctance. It will take time to re- 
gain an advantage.” 

“What else has offended besides 
Fairchild?” 

“His station.” 

“Kamon, you realize now that 
you are officially declared rogue 
and we are not answerable for your 
actions. We will broadcast suitable 
warnings to that effect.” 

“That is as I’ve planned. Aus- 
piseer.” He ended the communica- 
tion and turned to speak to his 
mate. She had regained her com- 
posure and was adjusting her belts 
of pre-fertilized egg capsules. “We 
will gestate no more young,” he 
said. “It would be useless.” 

VII 

o FAR, three things have gone 
wrong with the predictions,” the 
Heuritex said. “I’ve calculated 
based on all known constants and 
variables, all options open, but the 
trend is against the predicted re- 



GALAXY 




suits. I must conclude that there are 
large portions of information un- 
available to me. The model is in- 
adequate.” 

“In short, you’re useless,” Anna 
told the machine. 

“That is as it may be.” 

“I should replace you with my 
gigolo.” 

“He’s a handsome bastard. I’ll 
say that for him.” 

“What if we add the assumption 
that Kamon is going to behave er- 
ratically, say, deranged by being 
denied an after-life?” 

“Then the results are open again 
and we have more options.” 

“Then that’s our operating 
hypothesis. No, wait. Use this 
— Kamon will behave as if he is de- 
ranged, by human standards. And 
probably will not be by his own. 
Never underestimate opponents, not 
if you wish to grow old.” 

“Do you wish that to be an 
hypothesis, or an assumption? There 
is a difference, you know.” 

“Whichever way it works out 
best. You know what you’re doing 
better than I do, dearie.” 

“Incorporated. The resulting 
future- model indicates that the meet- 
ing at Precipice 5 — course corrected 
for that destination, by the by — will 
be the site of an attempt at destruc- 
tion. Kamon will probably be the 
destroyer, and the Aighors will 
claim insanity and rogue tactics to 
bow out of the responsibility.” 
“There. That sounds satisfying, 
doesn’t it? I think so.” She paced 

THE VENGING 



in front of the panel, then ordered 
gravitation shut off and floated at 
ease. “Warn Precipice 5 to be on 
full alert when Disjohn arrives.” 

“Done.” 

“And contact USC, division of 
Martial Aids, at Shireport. Tell 
them there is going to be a confron- 
tation in the Pafloshwa Rift, coordi- 
nates unknown.” 

“Such an action, without further 
information, will mark you as a 
rogue agent as well,” the machine 
said, a speculative tone in its voice. 

“Whatever for?” 

“First, it would not be . 
kosher ... to expect a supposedly 
friendly ship to attack. It would in- 
dicate a willingness to engage in 
battle, since you are heading toward 
the Rift and not backing out, and 
since you are going there of your 
own free will.” 

“Not exactly my free will. USC 
does not know I’m aboard this ves- 
sel, so they’ll assume — will have to 
assume — that the captain of this 
ship is not playing with a full deck 
of cards.” 

“You are the captain.” 

“Nonsense. You are. I shall have 
you overhauled when we get back 
to Ansinger.” 

“That will be a good time to in- 
stall the new Parakem function 
modules . Where are you sup- 
posedly?” 

“On Tau Ceti II. I made an ap- 
pointment with Jessamyn Negras for 
a business talk and she hates me 
enough to keep me waiting for at 



125 




least a month. She would refuse to 
believe anyone could possibly leave 
if they would miss out on the bles- 
sed chance to talk to her. And ap- 
propriately deluded recorders are 
going at all times in my apartments. 
I’m there, that’s certain.” 

‘‘I see,” said the Heuritex. 

VIII 

Kamon regretted killing the 
captain before learning all there was 
to know about ship operation. The 
Aighors who crewed the vessel 
were all skilled enough in their spe- 
cial tasks, as were the computers, 
but overall competence was, if not 
lacking, at least shaky. Kamon ab- 
sorbed the captain’s library rapidly. 

He received satisfaction from 
knowing an Aighor pilgrimage fleet 
was now forming on the borders of 
the Rift. His kind cheered him on, 
and the government — diplomats and 
rulers alike — had not sent a ship to 
stop him. Nor would they. 

Coldly, precisely, he used his trip- 
let brain to predict what difficulties 
would arise. First would be the de- 
fensive weaponry possessed by Prec- 
ipice 5 — negligible, all things con- 
sidered. Second, the presence of 
Anna Sigrid-Nestor, whom of all 
the humans he’d met he most ad- 
mired. Third — the final battleground 
would not be Precipice 5. He would 
have to chase Fairchild across the 
Rift. 

The station would be destroyed 
before the human ships arrived. 

126 



“airchild’s discovered the slag- 
ged ruin of Precipice 5, issued a 
distress signal on the station’s bp- 
half, and headed for deep space at 
full power. His ship was far enough 
from the major gravitational effects 
of the small system in hours and 
then shamelessly relied on proto- 
geometry jumps to take it deep into 
the Rift. It shut down all activities 
not connected with life-support, 
went into half-phase, and laid ghost 
images of itself across a wide range 
of continua. 

Graetikin silently cursed the Dal- 
lat conventions which allowed pri- 
vate ships to carry nothing more of- 
fensive than meteoroid deflection 
shields. He had spent his first thirty 
years in space as an apprentice 
commander in the Combine Astry, 
helping to command ships armed to 
their gunwales with all conceivable 
weapons, from rocket projectiles to 
stasis-shielded neutronium blocks 
which, warped into the center of 
another vessel, quickly gravitated 
the victim’s mass into a tiny, 
super-dense sphere. Now he faced 
this nemesis armed with nothing 
more deadly than signal rockets and 
half-phase warps. 

Fairchild’s motives and those of 
the Aighor didn’t concern him; Both 
in their own ways were right- 
thinking beings, concerned with 
good tasks. 

But he was concerned with survi- 
val. He wanted to live to captain 
another ship — or at least continue 



GALAXY 




captaining this one. He didn’t mind 
Fairchild’s employ. The man was 
reasonably sharp and knew how to 
provide for the upkeep of his own 
ships. If he had the tact of a young 
bull in dealing with alien cultures, 
that was usually not Graetikin’s 
province. 

Between and around these con- 
cerns, he re-worked his equations 
describing the Thrina. There was a 
cool, young hypothesis on the hori- 
zons of his rnind, and it tantalized 
him. In reworking the single expres- 
sion on his notepad, he found four 
connections with Parakem functions 
which he hadn’t noticed earlier. 
They implied that the Thrina, 
though ineffectual in a cause-effect 
relation in most geometries, had in- 
teresting properties in coincidence- 
controlled geometries. That meant 
they could influence certain aspects 
of status-geometry, where cause- 
effect and synchronicity operated in 
struggling balance. And that implied 
that if. 

He raised his eyebrows. 



1 HERE IS A GOOD possibility we 
can contact Fairchild if he chooses 
to coast free within the next thirty- 
five hours,” the Heuritex said. 

Anna grumbled out of a light 
doze at the pronouncement. ‘‘What 
was that?” 

‘‘We can join forces with him at 
points I have calculated along 
geodesics meeting in higher geome- 
tries.” 



‘‘Translate for us mortals, 
please.” She straightened up in her 
command chair and rubbed her face 
with her hands. 

“I think we can Join with 
Fairchild’s ship before Kamon 
reaches it. Here is our condition: 
fifth standard day of flight; all three 
ships are deep into the Rift. Fair- 
child is inert, following a least- 
energy geodesic in half-phase. 
Kamon is matching the most likely 
direction of that geodesic, though 
I’m certain he has no clear picture 
of the ship’s present position along 
such a path. We follow Kamon 
closely. And we are constantly cor- 
recting our charts with observations 
of the Rift pulsars and sin- 
gularities.” 

‘‘Yes, but what’s this about join- 
ing with Fairchild?” 

‘‘His vessel alone doesn’t have 
sufficient ‘influence’ to propel itself 
away from Kamon. He has little or 
no chance of escape in the long 
run. But with our two ships linked, 
we can create a broader effect-beam 
in proto-geometry — ” 

‘‘Is this more than mere theory?” 
‘‘I think so, madame. And I can 
do more than that; I can contact 
Disjohn Fairchild’s ship in a code 
only it can understand, and arrange 
for the rendezvous without the 
Aighor knowing.” 

‘‘You’re a maker of wonders, 
and you draw my curiosity like a 
magnet . into areas I’m sure will 
baffle me. But explain the code.” 
‘‘It would mix a standard com- 



THE VENGING 



127 




bine code with keys and message 
vectors linked to Fairchild’s position 
and frequency of interspatial . 
excuse me, I grow technical. Sim- 
ply, certain of those particular 
characteristics of Fairchild’s ship 
along its world line would enable it 
to quickly decode such a standard- 
ized message. Since only one ship 
occupies its peculiar position, only 
it can have any chance of decod- 
ing.” 

‘‘I’ll think on it,” she said. Why 
did he hesitate? she asked herself. 
Because now, faced with the possi- 
bility of doing what she had started 
out to do — to save Disjohn Fairchild 
at any cost — miserable, cold sense 
started to creep in. She needed to 
think about it, long and hard. There 
were too many considerations to 
weigh for a hasty decision. 

She made her way to the ship’s 
observation chamber. Far out on the 
needle-like boom which extended 
from the crew-ball, an isolated 
multi-sense chamber seemed to 
hang in dark space. But its walls 
were transparent only by illusion. 
Millions of luminous cells provided 
adjustable images of anything 
within range of the ship’s sensors, 
down to the Hnest detail a human 
eye could perceive. Images could be 
magnified, starbows undistorted into 
normal starfields for quick refer- 
ence, or high-frequency energy 
shifted into visual regions. If need 
demanded, such subtle effects as 
light distortion in higher geometries 
could be brought within the realm 

128 



of human interpretation. The sphere 
could also synthesize programmed 
journeys and sound effects, or any 
combination of fictions and synes- 
thesias. 

Anna requested a tour of the 
nearby singularities. ‘‘Will there be 
a specific sequence, madame?” the 
media computer asked. 

‘‘Only an introductory tour. And 
give me a voice-over to explain 
what I’m seeing.” 

The visual journey started. 

‘‘Some singularities are made ob- 
vious by surrounding nebulae,” the 
voice-over began. ‘‘These are veils 
of supernova dust and gas that have 
been expanding at tens of thousands 
of miles per second for hundreds of 
millions of years.” Fading in, wisps 
like fiery maiden’s hair or 
mart’s-tail clouds in a sunset, back- 
dropped by velvet space. Hidden 
within, a tiny spinning and glowing 
cloud, a pinprick, not Worh noticing 
. geometric jaws gaping wide, 
tides deadly as any ravening star- 
furnace. 

‘‘Others are companions to dim 
red stars, and thus are heavy x-ray 
sources. They suck in matter from 
their neighbors, accelerate and heat 
it through friction, and absorb it in 
bottomless wells. There is no com- 
prehensive explanation why the ma- 
jority of the Rift stars supemovaed 
within ten million years of each 
other, half an eon ago, but the re- 
sult is a treacherous graveyard of 
black holes, dwarfs and a few dim 
giants. They all affect each other 



GALAXY 




across their close-packed Rift in in- 
calculable patterns. 

“Some can be seen through ob- 
servation of the stellar background. 
The rings of stars around a black 
hole show the effects of gravita- 
tional lensing. Light is captured and 
orbited above the event horizons 
any number of times depending on 
the angle of incidence, producing 
two primary images and a succes- 
sion of subsidiary images caused by 
anomalies in the spinning singular- 
ity. The glowing gas-clouds falling 
into the holes produce central points 
of high-energy radiation, red-shifted 
into the visual spectrum by the 
enormous gravitational fields. These 
are surrounded by rings of stars 
reddened through clouds of gas, 
images of stars from every angle 
— every visible object, including 
those behind the observer. There are 
gaps of darkness and then succeed- 
ing rings of stars like the bands on 
an interferometer plate, finally 
blending into star-images almost 
undeviated by the singularity.” 

She was reminded of electronic 
Christmas ornaments from her 
childhood. The splendor was height- 
ened by the sphere’s adaptation to 
human vision, but only in part. 
Anna knew what she saw was very 
close to what existed outside, 
perhaps only a few million miles 
away in any direction, so close her 
ship could reach it in minutes . 

“Dear God,” she murmured. To 
fall into one of those things would 
be to transcend any past experience 



of death. They were miracles, intru- 
sions into reality, jesters of space- 
time. Her eyes filled with tears 
which nearly broke their tension 
bonds to drift away in free-fall. 

“Where no such diffractions and 
reflections are visible, perhaps ab- 
sorbed in dark nebulosities, and 
where no X-ray or Thrina sources 
give clues, naked singularities strip- 
ped of their event horizons lurk like 
invisible teeth. These have been 
charted by evidence obtained in pro- 
togeometry warps. There is no other 
way to know they exist.” 

The Thrina song of a nearby sin- 
gularity was played to her through 
audio. It sounded like the wailing of 
lost children, sweetly mixed with a 
potent bass bourn, an echoing 
cave-sound, ghost-sound, preter- 
natural mind-sound. “No reason is 
known for the existence of the 
Thrina song. It is connected with 
singularities as an unpredictable 
phenomenon of radiating and pat- 
terned energy, perhaps in some way 
directed by intelligence.” 

Anna Sigrid-Nestor left the 
sphere and drifted quickly back 
through the extension to the crew- 
ball. Her hands were shaking. Her 
cheeks were wet. 



IVamon followed and waited. A 
ship could remain in half-phase only 
so long before its unintentional 
mass loss (how easily he had spot- 
ted and avoided the ghosts!) reached 
a critical level. His shipmate medi- 



THE VENGING 



129 




tated and fasted alone in her cabin. 
Kamon was left with the simple- 
minded computers — it would be 
blasphemous for an Aighor machine 
to have a persona — and a few aides 
to see to his food and wastes. He 
preferred it that way. At one point 
he even ordered them to clear away 
the captain’s smashed body so he 
might feel truly alone. 

The Venging was close. He had 
had no further contact with the 
Council at Frain or any other 
Aighor agencies. He had spotted 
and charted the ship of Anna Sigrid 
Nestor, and felt his own sort of ap- 
preciation at the intuition she was 
following personally. She was on 
her own Venging. 

Such was the dominance pattern 
of humans. 



f OUR MINUTES thirty seconds 
before critical point,” Graetikin said 
softly. Lady Fairchild gripped her 
husband’s arm tighter. For a society 
woman she was holding up remark- 
ably well, Graetikin thought. He’d 
never had a chance to talk to her 
and see what she was like. 

The worst was yet to come. 
Kamon would inevitably chase them 
down, and there was only one 
chance left. His equation implied 
their survival if they took that 
chance. It was a terrifying prospect, 
even so. 

“We have to leave half-phase,” 
Fairchild said. “And we’ll have to 
outrun him. There’s no other way.” 



Edith nodded and turned away from 
the bridge consoles. 

“Have you ever wondered why 
he called a Venging?” she asked, 
facing away from the two men. 

“What?” Fairchild asked, not 
paying much attention to her. He 
was focusing on the blank viewers, 
as if to strain some impossible clue 
from them. It was useless, however. 
The eye interpreted glimpses of 
half-phase exteriors, as if they 
weren’t there, as indeed half the 
time they were not. 

“No other way,” Fairchild re- 
peated, his voice quiet as 
Graetikin’s. 

“Kamon has to have a reason,” 
Edith said, louder. 

“I’m sure he does,” Graetikin 
said. 

“I’ve been trying to find out 
what that reason is. I might have a 
clue.” 

“That doesn’t really concern us 
now,” Fairchild said, irritated. 
“Reason or no, we have to get 
away from him.” 

“But doesn’t it help to know 
what we’re going to die for?” Edith 
cried, her voice cracking. “You 
know damn well we can’t outrun 
him! Graetikin knows it, too. Don’t 
you?” 

Graetikin nodded. “But I 
wouldn’t say we’re going to die. 
There might be another way.” 

“You know of one?” Fairchild 
asked. 

Graetikin nodded. “But first, I 
want to hear what Lady Fairchild 



130 



GALAXY 




has to say about Kamon’s motive.” 
Disjohn took a deep breath and held 
up his arms. ‘‘Okay, Lady Ethnog- 
rapher,” he said to his wife, ‘‘tell 
us.” 

“It’s all in the library, for 
whomever would care to look it up. 
Some of it is even in the old books. 
We’ve known about it it for a cen- 
tury at least — the basic form of the 
Aighor pilgrimage. They have three 
brains, that’s well-known — but 
we’ve ignored the way they use 
those brains. One is for rational 
purposes, and it can do everything a 
computer can do — but it isn’t the 
dominant element. Another per- 
forms emotive and autonomic func- 
tions, and that’s where the seat of 
their religion is. We don’t know ex- 
actly what the third brain does, but 
I have an idea that it prepares the 
other two brains for a proper death. 
It has to balance them out, mediate. 
If the rational brain has an edge, the 
pilgrim won’t be prepared for death. 
I think the research conducted by 
the station might have given the 
Aighors a dilemma they couldn’t 
face — the rational treatment of sub- 
jects hitherto purely religious to 
them. It gave their rational minds 
an edge and caused an imbalance. 
So the pilgrims couldn’t be deliv- 
ered to the black holes without 
wholesale failure in proper rituals of 
dying.” 

‘‘And?” Graetikin asked, finger- 
ing his stylus. It seemed there was 
another shoe to drop in the matter, 
and she wasn’t dropping it. But he 



couldn’t decide what it was either. 

“And that’s it. I can’t go any 
further than that. I’m not really an 
ethnographer. But sometimes I wish 
to hell you had been, dear hus- 
band!” There was no bitterness or 
rebuke in her voice, only regret. 
Fairchild said nothing, staring at the 
empty screens. 

“You have another way?” he 
asked finally. 

“It’s possible,” Graetikin said. 
He began to outline his alternative. 
From the ninth word on Fairchild 
was pale, convinced his Captain had 
broken under the strain. 

Anna lay in the half-dark and 
watched him dress. For the first 
time in years she regretted that her 
emotional needs had drawn her 
away from constant alertness. But 
this was the first time she’d been 
with this handsome lad for anything 
more than companionship. He had 
proved not merely serviceable and 
charming, as though her aging 
frame didn’t bother him, but a sym- 
pathetic human being as well. 

“I don’t really understand all of 
what you’ve told me,” he said. His 
brown Polynesian physique shone in 
the golden sanitoire lamps. “But I 
think what you’re asking me is, do 
you have the right to put your ship’s 
crew in danger. Well, I’m part of 
that crew, and I say you’re the cap- 
tain, and I signed on — with the un- 
derstanding there might be hazards 
involved in deep-space travel.” 



THE VENGING 



131 




“These aren’t the normal 
hazards.” 

“But if it serves your purpose to 
link up with the other ship, then 
how can I or anyone else persuade 
you not to?” 

“Not by discussion, of that I’m 
sure,” she said. “But maybe Ry 
your presence. I do have respon- 
sibilities toward the people who 
work for me.” She was reminded 
of what Kondrashef had said to her. 
Even if they could link up with the 
Fairchild ship, what guarantee did 
she have that the Heuritex’s predic- 
tions were completely accurate? 
They didn’t have complete figures 
on what Kamon’s ship was capable 
of. Already they’d been surprised 
several times. And her first lieuten- 
ant, Nilsbaum, had worked the prob- 
lem out on an alternate computer, a 
human-manufacture Datapak. It had 
given them eighty percent chances 
of hitting a singularity if they linked 
and performed a proto -geometry 
jump. The heuritex had disagreed. 
But still, the dichotomy existed. 

“I can’t blast the bastard,” Anna 
said, “because every pot-shot I take 
is registered by the tattle machines I 
had to hook up to pass USC regula- 
tions. No way to tamper with 
them — they retreat into stasis 
whenever they’re not registering. 
No, a link-up is the only way.” 

She looked sharply at the kanaka. 
He looked back at her, his face 
blank and expectant. “Go take a 
shower,” she said. Then, softer, 
“Please. You helped me very 

132 



much.” She turned over and lis- 
tened to the sounds of the door clos- 
ing and water running. 

She was staring at the drifting 
colors on the nacreous ceiling when 
the intership chimed. She reached 
over to depress the switch' and lis- 
tened half-drowsily. The voice of 
the Heuritex brought her fully 
awake. 

“Madame, we’ve contacted 
Fairchild’s ships. First Lieutenant 
Nilsbaum requests your presence on 
the bridge.” 

“I’ll be there. Any message from 
Disjohn?” 

“He refuses to allow any link-up. 
He says he has two reasons — first, 
that he will not Jeapordize your 
life; and second, that his computers 
predict failure if such a plan is car- 
ried out. I don’t understand these 
machines of human construction.” 

“Did he say anything else?” 

“He just advised you to leave this 
sector.” 

She sat up in bed and put her 
chin in her hands. The shower was 
still running. “Another question,” 
she said. 

“Yes, madame.” 

“What happens to us if we hit a 
black hole? I’ve forgotten most of 
my physics ...” 

“Depending on the angle we hit 
at, we have several varieties of 
doom. If we go straight in, perpen- 
dicular to a tangent, we pass 
through two or more event hori- 
zons, depending on the theoretical 
geometry you subscribe to — ” 



GALAXY 




“What are event horizons?” 
“Simply the horizons beyond 
which no further events can be 
seen. The gravitational field at that 
point has accelerated any particle 
approaching it close to the speed of 
light. From an outside point of 
view, the particle’s time has slowed 
to almost nothing, no motion at all, 
so it will take an infinite time to hit 
the singularity below the event hori- 
zon. But from our point of view — if 
we are the hypothetical particle — we 
will hit it. Much that it will matter 
to us, though. Long before we pass 
through the innermost event horizon 
tidal forces will exert strains on us 
sufficient to strip us down to sub- 
atomic particles.” 

“Not too pleasant.” 

“No, but there are other options. 
At a lesser angle, we might pass 
through an outer event horizon at a 
speed sufficient to propel us into 
another geometry, and out again 
someplace else — a different place 
and time in our own universe, 
perhaps, or in another full- 
continuum universe. We might sur- 
vive that, if certain theoretical con- 
ditions prove true — though it would 
be a rough trip and the ship might 
not emerge in one solid piece.” 
“How can there be more than 
one event horizon?’’ 

“Because black holes rotate. May 
1 draw you a comparison of two 
Kruskal-Szekeres diagrams?’ ’ 

“By all means,” Ann said, ac- 
tivating the display screen on the in- 
tership. 



But the mosaic-like charts did lit- 
tle to help her comprehension. 



VuT OF THE HALF-PHASE, 

Kamon said to himself. “Now!” 

The image reappeared. He had 
misjudged the geodesic slightly. 
The ship was a light-hour farther 
away than he had predicted, which 
meant the ship’s appearance was an 
hour off from actual emergence. He 
felt a brief confusion. Fairchild had 
pulled it out of half-phase an hour 
early, then, since the appearance 
had happened according to Kamon’s 
schedule. But the ruse — if ruse it 
was — had gained them a very small 
advantage. He immediately 
switched to sub-space sensors. 

Fairchild’s ship was over four 
light-hours away. More disturbing, 
it was heading toward a nebulosity 
which charts said contained three 
collapsars, two of them black holes. 
Kamon deftly probed the nebula 
with his proto-geometry sensors. 
None of these singularities had ever 
been used for pilgrimages, thus they 
did not radiate Thrina songs. The 
area had not been thoroughly 
charted except on visual and radio 
levels from thousands of light-years 
away, where the patterns of the roil- 
ing gas-clouds had given away the 
presence of hidden collapsars. His 
new scanning revealed another 
member of the family, deadly elu- 
sive and sacred. It was a naked sin- 
gularity. The very presence of hu- 



THE VENGING 



133 




mans in such a region was 
sacrilege — ^but if they were choosing 
suicide over destruction at his 
hands, the danger was unthinkable. 
If they should plunge into any of 
the singularities . 

A shudder racked his entire body. 
He had heard of humans going in- 
sane under stress, but if they fell 
into a singularity here, the Venging 
was a failure and the Rift would 
never be clean again. 

He forced himself to be calm. 
They wouldn’t know how to prepare 
themselves for the Fall. They knew 
nothing about the mental ritual in- 
volved. It would be, in effect, noth- 
ing more than a suicide. Or it 
would be something worse, for 
them. 

But his basic instinct said des- 
troy them before they ever reached 
the cloud. For the first time he be- 
gan to feel real anxiety that he 
might fail. 

He did so want to live forever! 

“It can’t be done!’’ Lady Fair- 
child shouted. “Disjohn, I’m not 
ignorant! I know what those things 
are. Graetikin has to be insane to 
think we can survive that!” 

“I’ve heard him explain it. The 
computers back him up.” 

“Yes, on his assumptions!” 
“He’s on to something new. He 
knows what he’s talking about — and 
he’s right. We don’t have any other 
choice. The Aighor has every ad- 
vantage over us, including religious 
zeal — as you pointed out. We’ve 
tested event-models on the comput- 



ers again and again. We have one 
chance in a thousand of coming out 
alive. With Graetikin’s plan, our 
chances are at least ten times great- 
er.” 

“We’re going to die, is what 
you’re saying, either way.” 

“Probably. But there’s something 
grander about this way of going. It 
robs Kamon of his goal. We hold 
the upper hand now.” 

“You know what will happen if 
we suicide in one of the sin- 
gularities?” Edith asked. 

“We don’t plan on suiciding.” 

“Just going down one, we make 
this entire region useless to them for 
their pilgrimages. Mixing souls is 
anathema to them, like mixing 
meat and milk to an Orthodox 
Jew.” 

“There was a hygienic reason not 
to mix meat and milk. It spoils fas- 
ter.” 

“Are we so bloody materialistic 
that we can’t see a reason for this 
kind of tabu?” 

Fairchild swung his hands out 
and turned away from her, talking 
loudly to the wall. “Damn it, 
Edith, we have to use Occam’s 
razor! We can’t multiply our 
hypotheses until we avoid stepping 
on cracks for fear of killing our 
mothers. We’re rational beings! 
Kamon has that advantage over 
us — he is not acting rationally. He’s 
on a venging, just like a Goddam 
berserker, and he’s got a faster, bet- 
ter armed ship. We’re doomed! 
What should we do, bare our breast 



134

to him and shout ‘mea culpa’?” 
Edith shook her head. “I don’t 
know ... I feel so lost.” 

Fairchild shivered. “You’re not 
alone. Any being would.” 

“Except Aighors,” Edith re- 
minded him. “And they’ve always 
been prepared for it.”

He won’t let us dock with 
him, he’s turning toward the 
singularities — there’s nothing more I 
can do,” Anna said. “He’s choos- 
ing suicide rather than give Kamon 
the pleasure of executing him. Or is 
he up to something?” 

“I can offer no explanation, 
madame. Either they have gone in- 
sane or (hey have data unavailable 
to me.” 

She sighed and leaned back in 
her chair. “Can they receive any 
messages now?” 

“They are in the cloud. There’s 
too much interference.” 

“Veer off. Circle to the opposite 
side of the nebula and we’ll see if 
anything emerges at that end. I’ve 
met Fairchild’s captain — he may 
have more up his sleeve than we 
can know from this perspective.” 
Dumfounded, Anna watched the 
final act on her sensors and tapped 
her fingers on the Heuritex.

i ROBABILITY FELL apart at the er- 
gosphere interface of a singularity. 
Whether the same conditions ap- 
plied to a naked singularity or not, 

THE VENGING 



he did’t know — he guessed they 
would. But they wouldn’t have to 
face the danger of the tidal 
forces — there would be no event 
horizons, no overt indication of in- 
rushing space-time. The singularity 
ahead had collapsed from a star ob- 
lated by the presence of other stars, 
and the result was a hole in space- 
time stretched out into a line. If 
conditions still applied here, he’d 
have to figure their chances of sur- 
vival on a near-poetic hunch. 

It was clear to Graetikin now. 
Inter-universe connections of neces- 
sity were devoid of probablities. 
They were truce zones between re- 
gions of differing qualities, differing 
constants. Hence, somewhere above 
the singularity, re-shaping of in- 
falling material had to take place. 

Perhaps the Aighors weren’t far 
wrong after all. 

He worked all his findings into a 
single tight-packed signal on several 
media and broadcast it to space in 
general. When he was finished he 
turned to Disjohn and Edith and 
said, “Feels good to toss out a bot- 
tle, anyway. If someone picks it up, 
well and good. If not, we’ve lost a 
few megawatts. But we’ll replace 
that and more in the plunge. Too 
bad we won’t be able to use it.” 

“What does that mean?” Edith 
asked in a small voice. 

“If we survive, we’ll absorb the 
gain evenly and there will be no 
differences in potential to draw 
power from. And if we don’t, then 
it won’t matter.” 



135 




The computer spoke up in disag- 
reement. “It will be gained as over- 
all temperature increase and resis- 
tance to acceleration,” it said. “Not 
as anything involving potential.” 

“I was thinking metaphorically,” 
Graetikin demurred. “But it’s right, 
of course.” 



JVamon could either back off, 
let them escape and hope for an en- 
counter later, or he could pursue to 
the very end. But he was becoming 
fatalistic. It seemed the Fairchild 
ship was behaving not with human 
insanity, but with divine 
irrationality — a shield to his Veng- 
ing. That could imply they were 
operating in the Grace of the 
Thrina, not against it. He wished he 
could consult the Council with his 
new intuition, but there was no 
time. Whether he was correct or 
not, it made him reluctant to inter- 
fere. That small reluctance made 
him hesitate. 

“No!” he souted, pounding his 
thorax in disgust. “They are only 
insane! There is no Grace upon 
them!” 

But it was too late. He had fol- 
lowed the Fairchild ship into the 
nebulosity on a matching course. 
They could only construe that as an 
intention to continue the chase. 
Since they were insane, they would 
destroy themselves. 

In his self-rage, he considered 
destroying the Nestor ship for per- 
sonal satisfaction. But he had other 

136 



things to do. He had to prepare 
himself mentally for the Fall. He 
told the others to begin their rituals. 
They would follow all the way.” 

XIX 

Course plotted,” the computer 
told Graetikin. “There will be a 
proper configuration at these points 
of the chart. We can meet the 
singularity’s effect-field here, or 
here — that is, at these points in our 
future-line. If we fail within any 
width of time measurable in quan- 
tum jump intervals, we will come in 
at a closer angle and the warp-wave 
of our approach will create a tem- 
porary event horizon which will de- 
stroy us. These are our options.” 

“Initiate the action and test it on 
a closed loop. Then choose the best 
approach and put us there. Kamon 
hasn’t left our tail?” . 

“No, he still follows. And still 
jams.” 

“Then my message didn’t get 
through.” Somehow that didn’t 
bother him much. 

Fairchild gave the final order. 
Edith watched from his side with a 
small, knowing smile playing 
around her lips. She was remember- 
ing her childhood. She’d married 
Disjohn, in fact, because he re- 
minded her of the strength of her 
father. She needed that strength 
now. 

The ship’s corridors echoed with 
metal groans as the impact of the 

GALAXY 




nebula’s clouds smashed her. 

The tiny neutron star was pulsat- 
ing regularly. It was surrounded hy 
its own halo of accelerated parti- 
cles, a natural generator of radio 
energy. The two normal sin- 
gularities orbited each other, half a 
light-hour apart. The violet influx of 
gases outlined them clearly. Like 
two whirlpools whose surfaces have 
been smeared with oil, they glowed 
in disparate, shimmering mazes of 
light. Starlight ran in rings around 
them. Ghost images of each other 
flickered in the rings, and the 
ghosts carried rings of stars, and 
images of other ghosts. 

Here time and space rushed into 
multi-dimensional holes so rapidly 
that an object had to move at light 
speed to stay in one place. It was a 
Red Queen’s race of cosmic — and 
cosmological — proportions . 

In drawing diagrams of what 
happens in the singularity below the 
event horizons, space and time axes 
cross and replace each other. The 
word “singularity” itself is a phrase 
of no more significance than 
“boojum.” It implies points in any 
mathematical manifold where results 
start coming out in impossible 
terms, zeroes or infinities or imagi- 
nary numbers. Thus, Graetikin 
knew more than any of the others, 
they were soon to step off the pages 
of one book which had told their 
lives until now, leave that book be- 
hind and everything associated with 
it, and risk a plunge into null. 

God’s universe was being twisted 



into grotesque failures and incon- 
ceivable alterations. 

The naked singularity invisibly 
approached. 



JVamon’s thoughts grew fuzzy 
and uncoordinated. He spasmed 
with rage as one portion of his mind 
came unbalanced in the ritual, 
lashed out with his tail at the bulk- 
head before him, denting the inch- 
thick metal. Then he regained bal- 
ance. 

The holiday display of the black 
holes dominated everything. 

He was ready. A tiny reserve part 
of him prepared his weapons for the 
last-ditch effort, then vanished into 
the calm pool of his being. 

XXI 

Disjohn FAIRCHILD felt a giddi- 
ness he’d never known before. It 
was analogous to being spun on a 
carnival toy, but every part of him 
felt it differently. 

“I’m expanding,” Lady Fairchild 
said. “I’m getting bigger. Alite 
down the rabbit hole — ” 

Still the ship fell. And fell. 

Edith gasped. The bridge dark- 
ened for the blink of an eye, then 
was suddenly aglow with scattered 
bits of ghost lightning. She held her 
hands in front of her eyes and saw a 
blue halo around them like Cheren- 
kov radiation. Expansion. Altera- 
tion. The desk in front of her, and 



THE VENGING 



137 




her arms on the desk, broke into 
color-separated images and de- 
veloped intricate networks of fili- 
gree, became crystalline, net-like, 
tingled and shimmered and pulsed, 
then repeated in reverse and became 
solid again. Everything smelled of 
dust and age, musty like vast li- 
braries. 

Both ships ended their existence 
in status geometry, at the same mo- 
ment, Kamon following at a differ- 
ent angle, but hitting the affect-field 
simultaneously with the Fairchild 
ship. As he had known it would, 
the Aighor’s warp-wave created a 
temporary event horizon and he was 
divested of his material form. 

The Fairchild ship survived its 
fall. Graetikin’s equations, thus far, 
were wholly accurate. 

None of them could conceive of 
what happened in the interface. It 
was not chaos — it was instead a sea 
of quiet, an end to action. The de- 
struction and rearrangement of rules 
and constants led to a lassitude of 
space-time, an endless sargasso of 
thought and event, mired and tan- 
gled and grey. 

Then each experienced that pecu- 
liar quality of their world-line which 
made them unique. Fairchild, stable 
and strong, did not see much to 
surprise him. Graetikin marvelled in 
a welter of mathematical insight. 
Edith, still wrapped in childhood, 
had a nightmare and woke far in her 
own past, a child screaming for her 
father. 

Again the darkness. The 



ouroboros of the hole spat them out. 
The computers triggered a lengthy 
jump, as best as they were able, for 
the actions of their smallest circuits 
were still not statistically reliable. 
This was the chance Graetikin knew 
they all had to take. 

They lived. The ship rattled and 
shivered like a dog throwing off 
water from a swim, while the howl 
of metal made Fairchild’s scalp 
prickle and his arm-hair stand on 
end. Suddenly the bridge cabin was 
swept as by a rush of wind and it 
was over. Edith Fairchild wept 
quietly and Disjohn, beside her, 
trembled. 

Graetikin bounced his fingers 
clumsily over the screen controls, 
then corrected and gave them a 
view of what lay outside. 

“I don’t see anything,” Fairchild 
said. 

“I’m astonished we even made 
it,” Graetikin whispered. Disjohn 
gave him a strange' look. With ad- 
justment, the screen still showed 
darkness. 

“Give me a scab and chart all 
radiating sources,” the captain or- 
dered the computer. 

“Standard H-R distribution shows 
nothing. There is only an average 
temperature,” it said. 

“What’s the temperature?” 

“Two point seven one degrees 
Kelvin.” 

Graetikin slammed his scriber 
onto the panel. “Any white hole ac- 
tivity? Any signs of the singularity 
we just came though?” 



138 



GALAXY 




“Nothing.” 

“We had to come out of some- 
thing!” 

“Undefined,” the machine said 
cryptically. 

“What does that mean?” Edith 
asked. 

“It means we’re in a region of 
heat-death.” 

“Where?” 

“Undefined,” the computer said 
again. 

“ ‘Position’ is a meaningless 
term now,” Graetikin explined. 
'"Everything is evenly distributed. 
We’ve come into a dead universe. 
We’re at the top of a beat between 
expansion and collapse.” 

“What can we do?” Disjohn 
asked. He felt an intense ache for 
his wife, and wished she were at his 
side. 

It seemed he had lost her only 
recently, the grief was so strong. 
He looked at Edith. She resembled 
her mother so strongly his throat 
ached. He patted his daughter on 
the head, but felt none of the reas- 
surance he was trying to give. 

“We might be able to go into 
stasis and wait it out. But we’d 
have to have a timer, something 
measuring the progress of the uni- 
verse outside us. I don’t think any 
of our instruments would last that 
long.” 

“There has to be a way!” Fair- 
child said. 

“I told you. Father,” Edith said 
with preternatural precocity, “we are 
being punished.” 



Graetikin thought of them waiting 
until the ship ran out of energy and 
food and breathable air. Years, cer- 
tainly. But years with a bumt-out 
old politician and a pre-pubescent 
girl, his daughter; a triangle of infin- 
itely agonizing possibilities. 

“Daddy,” Edith, pale and trembl- 
ing, asked her father, “are we in 
Hell?” 



1 HEY ROUNDED THE nebula and 
waited. Anna asked the Heuritex 
several times if anything had been 
sighted, and each time it replied, in 
the negative. “There is no sign.” it 
said finally. “We would do well to 
return home.” 

“Nothing left,” Anna said. She 
couldn’t convince herself she had 
done all she could. 

“One moment, madame,” the 
Heruritex said. “This region was 
devoid of Thrina before.” 

“So?” 

“There is a signal emerging from 
the black holes. A single Thrina 
tone, very strong.” 

“That’s what started this whole 
thing,” Anna said quietly. “Ignore 
it, and let’s go home.”

On the edges of the Rift, the 
pilgrims received the Thrina, and 
there was rejoicing. 

The death-ships resumed their 
voyages. ★ 



THE VENGING 



139 




The klaxon’s hooting caught 
me in my usual daydream. I was 
supposed to be plodding through 
The Journal of Electrical Engineer- 
ing, but instead of circuits and ten- 
sors there nestled in my head a vis- 
ion of my uncle’s farm, of the 
many summers I’d spent there, 
picking blackberries and playing in 
the woods with my cousins. Sum- 
mers that merged indistinguishably 
in my memory, unlike the precise 
nine-month terms of scholastic 
drudgery. 

That year we built the 
hideout — was I eight or ten? And 
when in that misty arcadia had 
Bobby hurt his head diving into the 
creek? 

The klaxon blared. 

I jumped up and ran from the 
Engineering Library. Students hud- 
dled against the walls to give me 
clear passage down the corridor. 
This is it, this is it. My heart 
pounded. 

VTOLs were already lumbering 
aloft from the airstrip behind the 
Purdue campus. The Central agents 
cursed as I trotted up to my ship, 
late as usual, and hustled me 
aboard. My assigned seat was in the 
rear, so I plopped into the co-pilot’s 
and hooked the safety mesh. The 
tall Central agent eyed me but said 
nothing. 

I smiled as we lurched into the 
air. Even in the bureaucratic 
superstate the condemned man has 
certain rights. 

We levelled off at 3,000 meters 
and blasted west. 



Into the Abyss. 

The VTOL smelled of hot oil. I 
turned to the agents. “What hap- 
pened to the Drain? Did someone 
finally spot it and knock it out 
without destroying it?’’ 

The tall one shrugged. “It just 
went off the air. We don’t know if 
it was an accident — or if someone 
turned it off.’’ 

He paused to let me think: it 
could be a trap. 

“We hope you’ll find out for 
us.” 

In Cedar Rapids? Sure, I faced 
forward again. The epicenter of the 
Abyss — the most likely location of 
the Drain — was 5 kilometers south- 
west of Des Moines. But I’d been 
assigned to search Cedar Rapids, 
nearly 200 klicks out. I could tell 
what Central thought of my elec- 
tronics skills. 

The telecopier on the left bulk- 
head whirred and emitted a long 
sheet of paper. The stocky agent 
passed it on. Data from the automa- 
tic monitoring stations and satellites 
that had sounded the alarm: field in- 
tensity decay, r.f. flux curves, hys- 
teresis effects. Nothing immediately 
helpful . 

I tossed it back. How many 
thousands of scientists and en- 
gineers around the world were 
studying similar printouts? 

More important, how many inves- 
tigators besides Central’s would 
sneak into the Abyss to hunt for the 
Drain? 

I went aft to suit up. As I peeled 
off my university tunic I recalled I 



141 




had a three o’clock class. Sorry, 
kids. There’d be a lot of classes 
cancelled today; Central had 23 
technicians stationed at Purdue. 

I slipped into a camouflage 
jumpsuit, wondering if our 
academic “colleagues” would miss 
us if we didn’t return. The condes- 
cension of the PhD’s was subtle; 
they knew Central took care of the 
people it needed — that’s why I 
taught sophomore circuit design. 
Central thought it would keep my 
mind honed. 

But the faculty let me know I 
wasn’t really good enough to be_ 
part of their world. Just thinking 
about it, I almost ripped the zipper, 
pulling it tight, and began to strap 
on my instruments. 

“We’re at the boundary,” the 
pilot said. 

Illinois looked the same as India- 
na. Roads snaked along, and even 
the fields held the rectilinear out- 
lines of 20 years ago. I could al- 
most imagine Uncle Dave still 
tended his 80 hectares outside 
Moline. But I knew if we dipped 
lower, we’d see only brush or grass 
growing where com and soybeans 
once stood in neat rows. 

The shards of a ruined town came 
into view but we were too high to 
see any primitives. 

As we penetrated deeper into the 
Abyss, the Central agents betrayed 
their tension only by a tighter than 
usual control. They were worrying, 
of course, that the Drain might 
come back on before they dumped 

142 



me and flew out of danger. Experts 
still quarrelled over whether a person 
could understand what was happen- 
ing after it began. Some political 
prisoners from the ’83 coup had 
been flown through the Abyss in 
robot ships, but the tapes of their 
gibberings had been inconclusive. 

They landed me on First Street in 
the center of Cedar Rapids, the 
VTOL lingering only long enough 
for the two agents to roll a jeep 
from the cargo bay. Then I was 
alone except for a fading whine 
heading east; out of the Abyss. 

Jab a compass into Des Moines. 
Set it for a 500-kilometer radius. 

Begin the circle at Chicago, 
which falls just inside. Arc north 
through Green Bay (most of Wis- 
consin is inside) and Duluth (so is 
southern Minnesota). Then swing 
south through Aberdeen and Pierre 
(there goes eastern Sputh Dakota). 
Almost all of Nebraska falls inside 
the Abyss. As the circle swings 
southeast, so does Kansas. Finally it 
slices through Missouri and back up 
through western Illinois. 

Scratch Chicago, Minneapolis-St. 
Paul, Omaha, Kansas City, St. 
Louis. About 23,000,000 people 
were inside the Abyss when the 
Drain was turned on. 

Current population (est.): 90,000. 
Current lifestyle: neolithic. 

Inside the jeep were a Photonflux 
.80 and four spare power charges. I 
buckled it on and stowed the extra 



GALAXY 




charges in a pouch, trying to recall 
how long it’d been since I had last 
held a weapon. Was it in ’86 that 
Central issued the personal firearms 
decree? No matter. Just the weight 
of a gun at my hip evoked my old 
Robin Hood fantasies. One against 
the world. 

I looked at the sky where the 
VTOL had vanished and I laughed. 
No wonder they hadn’t given me 
the gun while I was in the ship. 

Cedar Rapids hadn’t changed 
much from the small town I knew 
24 summers ago as a Polytechnic 
engineering student on my first pro- 
fessional summer job. The two big 
hotels, a bit shabbier, still faced 
each other like haughty dowagers. 
The silos over by Water Street had 
lost their white paint but seemed in- 
tact. The store windows were empty 
but whoever had looted them hadn’t 
burned or smashed much. 

The same placid, backwater 
town I remembered. A bit over- 
grown, but that was all. What was 
24 years to a town that had barely 
entered the century? 

I wandered through a few build- 
ings, more for the sake of reminis- 
cence than reconnaisance. My 
reason for being in Cedar Rapids — a 
“suspicious movement” detected by 
a satellite — could have been in- 
vented by a monitor tech under 
pressure to get results. I’d seen those 
games at Purdue, where profes- 
sors had to churn out papers and 
monographs to advance their 
careers. Everyone knows that the 

LET DARKNESS FALL 



game is meaningless, but you’re still 
judged by the points you score. So 
fake it. 

I spat and stretched. It was nice 
just to escape Central’s ubiquitious 
surveillance, even if only for a few 
hours. 

I was just beginning to relax 
when I spotted the primitives. 

^^ITHOUT THE EVENTS of July 14, 
1979, the naked grease-and-dirt- 
smeared creatures running towards 
me probably would have grown up 
to be sedate, responsible Cedar 
Rapids burghers. 

Then a mysterious power sent an 
arcane radiation humming over 

785.000 square kilometers of Mid- 
dle America and six thousand years 
of civilization were dissipated in 
seconds as the transmission bollized 
long-term memory. The unshield- 
able force destroyed such learned 
skills as reading, power plant 
maintenance, driving, higher math. 
Almost every culture trait a com- 
plex industrial society needs to op- 
erate was scrambled into chaos. 

Language remained, although on 
a far simpler level. So did family 
bonding. Without those, not even 

90.000 would have survived the 
crash. 

When the rioting, burning, mur- 
der, famine and plagues were over, 
the Midwest was populated with 
small bands and a few larger tribes 
right out of the New Stone Age. 

I caught myself looking for a 

143 




familiar face as they chased each 
other toward me. Stupid of me. 
There were three girls and two 
boys; the oldest had yet to face 
puberty. Even if I’d known one of 
their parents, he or she wouldn’t 
remember me now. The Drain had 
taken — 

A girl spotted me and yelled 
something in a strange tongue. A 
second later tag was forgotten as 
they gaped. I leaned back against 
the jeep, hoping they wouldn’t 
flee. How does one indicate peace- 
ful intentions to simple peoples — 
open hands, waving leafy boughs? I 
wished Central had better prepared 
me. 

We watched each other across a 
distance of about 25 meters. They 
were quite filthy, but they seemed 
healthy enough. The summer sun 
had left their skins dark, and sinew 
corded beneath it. Oh, most had 
pox scars, and one boy squinted as 
if he needed glasses. But my do- 
minant impression, fueled by their 
quick, alert movements, was of 
squirrels. 

Finally I broke the tableau. “Hi, 
kids,” I ventured. They screamed 
with laughter and scurried off down 
an alley. 

1 climbed into my jeep and drove 
off puzzled. Central’s documen- 
taries on Abyss life, using film 
from satellites and robot probes, 
usually showed children with dis- 
tended bellies, fly-plagued open 
sores or rickets. I’d accepted that as 
the norm and pitied them their harsh 

144 



life without diapers and measles 
vaccine. But come to think of it, 
humanity had survived for many 
millenia without such refinements. 
The first years are rough, but once 
natural selection has culled out the 
weak. 

I spotted them once more as I 
circled the block. They were creep- 
ing across the overgrown play- 
ground behind Benjamin Harrison 
Elementary School, moving like the 
Indians I used to read about in my 
grade school days. It’s a shame 
psychotropic drugs and behavior- 
reinforcing machines have replaced 
the hokey old history books. Both 
methods of teaching were set up to 
mold “good” citizens, but when I 
compare my classmates to the 
potatoes shuffling into my courses 
at Purdue, I wonder where it’s go- 
ing to end. 

Random turnings brought me to 
Municipal Island where I took a 
chance on an old bridge. Floods had 
piled trees and debris around the 
outer building, but the county court- 
house still towered over the island. 
I found the emergency stairs and 
climbed to the wide balcony just be- 
low the top of the building. 

Wind mussed my hair as I looked 
over a town melting into prairie. A 
green ocean, it nibbled at an island 
built of human toil. I thought of Ur 
and Persepolis. Why do we go to 
all the trouble, when entropy always 
wins in the end? 

A glorious lassitude crept over 
me. It was only two hours ago that 

GALAXY 




the Drain went off yet I felt light- 
years from my former existence. No 
loyalty monitors. No need to choose 
every word with care. No more 
cramming to keep abreast of ever- 
accelerating technological change; 
my first real vacation in years! 

I strolled around the tower. To 
the north I spotted the plant where 
I’d worked so many summers ago. 
Bollins Radio Research. There I had 
learned two things much more im- 
portant than electronics. One was 
the subtle savagery of office poli- 
tics. The other was the limits of my 
talent. 

That was the summer I had 
learned I wouldn’t fulfill my ambi- 
tions. 

Claws scrabbled on the white 
granite of the balustrade. A pigeon. 
The Abyss swarmed with animal 
life, now that man wasn’t such 
deadly competition. Even the bison 
were coming back. The contrast 
amused me. In the midst of a data- 
bank U.S.A. the pioneer milieu was 
reborn. Not a Midwest white- 
house-maple-tree-porch-swing nos- 
talgia hype, but the real Old 
America — 

The pigeon beside me exploded 
into blood and burnt featherstink. 

The laser was in my hand before 
1 hit the deck. Blast. Another inves- 
tigator in Cedar Rapids. Instead of 
peeking over the edge and getting 
my brain broiled, I rolled over on 
my back and studied the wall. About 
two meters above the railing 
where the pigeon had been was a 

LET DARKNESS FALL 



burn. I calculated the angle. The 
sniper must be almost directly be- 
low, only a hundred meters from 
the base of the courthouse. Some- 
where on Municipal Island. 

I snaked inside and padded down 
the stairs. Every five landings I 
stopped to listen, heart pounding, 
hoping 1 could reach the bottom be- 
fore he could trap me inside. 

He was dumb, though. I made it 
down and was just peeking around 
the bottom of a side door when he 
got up the nerve to rush the court- 
house. 1 sighed in relief as I burned 
his legs off. But after all, most of 
the good investigators would be in 
Des Moines. Only second-raters 
pulled outlying cities. 

I shot his laser from his hand and 
strolled over to administer the coup 
de grace. He stank worse than the 
pigeon but I’d dealt with worse dur- 
ing my hitch in the Venezuelan 
War. Eyes clenched, face contorted, 
moaning. I tapped his cheek with 
my foot to get his attention. “Who 
you working for?” 

“Kill me kill me kill me.” 

“First you have to tell me who 
hired you.” 

“Com.” 1 snuffed him. 

Turning this interesting bit of in- 
formation over in my mind. I was just 
beginning to congratulate myself 
when I realized he might have a 
partner. And there 1 stood in the 
middle of the street. A perfect 
target. 1 began to laugh, insane 
laughter at the empty-eyed build- 
ings. 

145 




Cedar Rapids, City of Second- 
Raters. 

Corn? 

You’d think everyone would want 
the Drain turned off — a given, 
right? Great cities deserted, 90,000 
people trapped in savagery, rail and 
river and road links severed. A gap- 
ing wound in the nation’s heartland. 
What pathos. 

At first it was treated as a tem- 
porary aberation. Iowa and Wiscon- 
sin were classified special federal 
territories. The surviving fragments 
of Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska 
set up rump governments staffed by 
the few state officials who escaped 
the Drain. Companies that had been 
headquartered in Abyss cities 
adapted fast or were shouldered 
aside by rivals. The federal gov- 
ernment announced low-interest 
loans would be available to 
homeowners when the Drain went 
off and exiles needed funds to fix 
up their houses. 

But five years flowed into ten, 
and then fifteen. 

The population plummeted, then 
stabilized as individuals learned to 
cope with the new subsistence 
economy. Inside the Abyss the 
cities rotted, but outside — 

Corn farmers in Indiana and east- 
ern Illinois had made fortunes since 
the Abyss had interdicted 90 per- 
cent of the nation’s best com land. 
Similarly, marginal wheat land in 
panhandle Nebraska and eastern 

146 



Colorado boomed as stockmen bid 
up the price of feed. The price of 
Texas beef tripled with Kansas out 
of the way. The South benefited 
from the need for substitute protein 
sources like soybeans and peanuts. 
Northern Minnesota found itself 
with a near-monoply on dairy pro- 
ducts, now that Wisconsin was 
gone. 

Chicago’s demise especially al- 
tered commerce. New commodities 
exchanges blossomed in Fort Worth 
and Dallas. New mail-order houses 
were created. Pittsburgh’s heavy 
metals and machine-fabrication in- 
dustries boomed. 

Even Louisville and Cincinatti 
benefited; their sickly beers were 
back in the running with Milwaukee 
and St. Louis gone. 

Billions of dollars flowed around 
the Abyss, settling into new pat- 
terns, encysting the scar. 

Not all the moneymen wanted the 
Abyss to remain. Oh, how the real- 
tors screamed for Central to nuke 
Des Moines and destroy the Drain 
so they could reopen the Midwest. 
Some of the bills they introduced in 
Congress before it was disbanded 
would have made the Oklahoma 
Land Rush seem sedate. 

But Central refused to do any- 
thing to eliminate the Abyss at the 
risk of destroying the machine(s) 
that generated it. Someone had de- 
signed the ultimate weapon for de- 
populating a nation while leaving its 
industries and resources intact. Why 
hadn’t its creators struck again? Had 



GALAXY 




they been caught in the Abyss when 
the Drain went on? 

Other powers than Central had 
investigators ready for the day the 
Drain went off. 

Eventually I abandoned even 
the pretense of looking for the 
Drain and drove out to the Bollins 
plant. 

At first it bothered me that I’d 
lost my fear of the Drain. Most of 
my life had been spent learning to 
cope with scientific and political 
structures; if the Drain went on all 
that would be blasted into the 
ozone. 

Well, so what? 

I wondered what it would be like 
to live in a world where disputes 
were settled by hand-to-hand com- 
bat instead of satellites poised to 
spew nerve gas over entire conti- 
nents. Where one grubbed food 
from the earth instead of inserting a 
credit card into a cafeteria machine. 
I might not live as long, or as well, 
but. 

My route took me past a family 
living in a crumbling frame house. 
Children played around a woman 
with sagging breasts mashing some- 
thing in a bowl. At the sound of my 
engine a man came to stand beside 
her, warily hefting a spear. I didn’t 
stop. 

What would become of them if 
the Drain stayed off? Nothing 
could help the primitives who’d 
wandered outside the Abyss; some 

LET DARKNESS FALL 



long-term effect of the force pre- 
vented substantive re-education. 
What niche could they fill in 
technocratic society? Reservations? 
Zoos? Or experimental subjects for 
the psych teams? 

1 put the thought aside as I en- 
tered the winter-twisted parking lot. 
I didn’t want to think ahead to my 
inevitable return. 

Nostalgia flared as I walked 
through long corridors to the wing 
that had housed my desk. I’d 
learned a great deal from the wise 
old engineers here, much of it non- 
technical. How to take credit for 
another’s idea. How to spot the per- 
son who really controls the division 
and win his favor. How to wheedle 
computer time away from someone 
else and how to cover mistakes. I’d 
entered Bollins very green but by 
Summer’s end — 

Ah, there was the door. 

The office had been converted 
into a lab. 

1 sagged against a testing bench, 
suddenly tired. My fantasies of sit- 
ting in the section manager’s chair 
and desecrating his desk vanished. 
Everything changed. New furniture, 
even a new wall or two I could 
have accepted. But not a complete 
phase-out. It was as if the room had 
never known my existence. 

A whisking noise drifted into my 
gloom. Approaching down the cor- 
ridor. Secret agent synapses flared 
and I jumped behind a bulky elec- 
tronic assemblage and leveled my 
laser at the door. It could be anyone 

147 




from a primitive to another inves- 
tigator. 

A man wearing a silvery helmet 
casually walked in. 

“Freeze!” I shouted. He halted, 
looking about in confusion. “Hold 
it right there.” I stood up so he’d 
see I had the drop on him. 

His face was disturbingly famil- 
iar. Was he someone I’d seen at 
Purdue, stringing for a private firm 
hunting the Drain? “Who are you 
working for?” I demanded. 

“Why, myself.” He stared back, 
bemused. “I built the Drain. Please 
be careful, you’re leaning on it.” 

Twenty minutes later I began to 
accept his tale. I stood before Jim 
Rudolphson, holding my laser in 
one hand and a sheaf of carelessly 
sketched schematics in the other, 
listening to an absurd tale of a loner 
and maverick who beat the system 
by destroying it. 

“. and once I’d figured out 
the affinity principle, it was easy to 
calculate 34 watts at 200 centimet- 
ers would neutralize RNA transfer. 
Getting the lysine for the radiating 
element was the hardest part. So 
then I asked myself, where to build 
the transmitters? Why not in the 
most moronic security system in the 
world. Hollins Radio Research. 
Remember the time you created a 
new circuit and wrote a memo on 
it? And when you wanted to see the 
memo later they wouldn’t let you 
because in the meantime it had been 
re-classified and your security rating 

148 



wasn’t high enough? I built the 
transmitters in the lab here, the 
fools. .” 

The extent of my luck astounded 
me. I had the Drain and its inven- 
tor. Suddenly a position in one of 
Central’s high-powered research 
labs didn’t seem beyond my reach. 
Excited? Like the last day of fifth 
grade, knowing that in a few days I 
would be on my way to Uncle 
Dave’s farm again. 

”... really threw them off was 
hologramatic wave transmission. I 
knew if I used ordinary point- 
radiation antenna they could figure 
out the locus, examine it from satel- 
lites, and send in robots to put me 
off the air. So I connected two 
transmitters to the device — the other’s 
in a silo near Lincoln, with 
shielded long-life batteries like this 
one — and I adjusted them to create 
an energy nexus over Des Moines. 
A delicate balance,, oh yes. It wa- 
vered every time a thunderstorm 
came along. But that just generated 
all the more r.f. flux to wipe out 
centuries of intellectual gar- 
bage. .” 

On he rattled, assuming because 
he remembered me from years ago 
at Hollins there was a personal bond 
linking us. What a romantic idiot. 
But that summed him up. He was 
an eccentric, continually running 
afoul of the corporate machine, tol- 
erated only for his occasional flights 
of genius. Hologramatic wave 
transmission? That alone could have 
earned him fame. 



GALAXY 




I remembered the jibes of the 
older engineers, who thought him 
too flighty to realize their mockery. 
Rudolphson must have enjoyed 
watching their minds melt. 

“Since I knew how to neutralize 
the radiation’’ — he touched his 
helmet — “I could go anywhere in- 
side the Abyss, do anything I 
wanted without interference. Most 
of the time I worked in the labs. 
Want to see the clocks I built? 
Sometimes I had to go outside to 
buy parts or pick up technical pub- 
lications. I had lots of money. It 
was lying all over the city. Oh, I 
enjoyed those trips outside. One 
newspaper thought I was a Brazilian 
plot. Another said I was from outer 
space. And one. .’’ 

I had to admit he’d conjured up a 
pleasant dream. A decompressed 
society where people could be 
themselves instead of fitting into 
roles built up over centuries by 
others. What new world would the 
primitives create, if we let them 
continue? Would their path inevita- 
bly lead to another Argus-eyed 
bureaucracy? Or would they avoid 
our mistakes? This madman’s dream 
had cost millions of lives, but might 
it not, after all, be worth it? 

I envied Rudolphson. Instead of 
enduring high-competition egos, in- 
stead of slicing off little pieces of 
himself to satisfy society’s whims, 
he’d kicked over the gameboard. 
What glorious anarchism! I sensed 
it burning in his eyes as he pleaded 
with me to join him in repairing the 

LET DARKNESS FALL 



circuit that had let the soothing 
radiation vanish. 

I was postponing the inevitable 
when a man in green coveralls 
spoke from the door I’d forgotten. 

“Hold it, both of you.” He eased 
into the lab. He made me drop my 
gun and then ignored me; my GI 
camouflage suit proclaimed my 
master. Keeping his gun trained on 
me, he eyed Rudolphson’s outdated 
civilian clothes. “Who are you 
working for?” 

“My name is James Samuel 
Douglas Allen Rudolphson and I 
invented the Drain. Will you help 
me fix it?” 

He laughed. A thick braying guf- 
faw. “Where’d you find this nut?” 
he asked me. 

Rudolphson screamed, shrill and 
sudden, and leaped. 

We were both surprised, but the 
other investigator was fast; his beam 
cut the mad scientest in half before 
he had moved three meters. But that 
gave me enough time. His second 
shot went over my head and before 
he could slice the beam down 
across me I burned him. 

My knees shook as I staggered 
back up. Probably adrenalin activat- 
ing a flight-reflex, fighting my con- 
scious mind. No need to run now, I 
told myself, thinking of the other 
Central flunkies frantically search- 
ing ruined Midwest cities, shoulders 
hunched as they wait for the Drain 
to snuff them. Nothing to fear, old 
chaps. I have the situation well in 
hand. You’re safe. 

149 




As long as I don’t turn the Drain 
on again. 

I rescued the schematics from a 
threatening rivulet of gore and rif- 
fled them musingly. Poor Rudolph- 
son had completed most of the 
repairs. With these I could do the 
rest. The Abyss could blossom 
again, dark orchid over Middle 
America. With the helmet to shield 
me I could laze out my remaining 
years free of the power-pigs out- 
side. It would be better than exile. 
No extradition, no assassins in the 
Abyss, no siree. And if I grew 
bored I could slip back into the 
United States. 

My vision cleared. I remembered 
my would-be arcadia was only an 
enclave in an immensely stronger 
civilization that every year came 
closer to destroying the entire 
planet. The Abyss wouldn’t protect 
me from H-bomb radiation or bacte- 
rial weapons. 

Turn it on? What an atavistic 
fantasy, I chuckled, as 1 clenched 
the firing stud and beamed the 
Drain into slag. So childish, so un- 
worthy of me. I tucked the schema- 
tics into my pouch and stepped into 
the corridor. Then I set the lab on 
fire and ran from the building, gig- 
gling with pyromantic glee. 

A pity, but not to be helped. 
Long before I could repair the 
Drain, Central would have follow- 
up agents in to investigate my “dis- 
appearance” and they would doubt- 
less come across the device. And if 

150 



I did report in, then Central would 
pull me out; and somebody, some- 
time would find the Drain. No, this 
was the only way. I sat down under 
an oak 150 meters from the Bollins 
Plant and prepared to enjoy the con- 
flagration. 

The next steps laid themselves 
out with cause-effect precision. 

In a few days they’ll come pick 
me up. By then I will have 
memorized the major Drain as- 
semblies and principles and de- 
stroyed the schematics. With the 
evidence gone (half of it burned, 
the other half unlikely to be discov- 
ered in its abandoned silo before 1 
visit Lincoln and destroy it too) the 
secret of the Abyss remains hidden. 
A mystery for the ages. 

Eventually I will outlive my use- 
fulness to Central and be mustered 
out. Ten, fifteen years? No matter. 
In the end I’ll be a forgotten old 
tech with a little home lab to putter 
about in. On a farm, perhaps? It 
must appear innocuous. 

The whole central building was 
aflame now. Fragments of roofing 
ripped free and hurtled aloft, riding 
a fountain of fire that expanded as 
destruction ate through the plant. 

I turned to the section on power. 
Surely with modem components the 
range could be extended beyond a 
mere 500 kilometers. An interesting 
technical problem. I thought of the 
ionosphere. Under certain condi- 
tions it reflects radio waves com- 
pletely around the world. 

I like the simple life. ★

Reality is in. 





151 




Tenzin peered back at the Lama 
through his little gold-rimmed spec- 
tacles. He wanted to ask a question, 
but prudence overcame his curious- 
ity and he waited. Eventually Kat- 
sang Rimpoche added, “The Yidam 
must be taken as the object of your 
contemplation.” 

After a little while it became ob- 
vious that the audience was at an 
end. Tenzin bowed in the Chinese 
manner, touching his forehead to 
the ground. It was an extravagant 
gesture, but one warranted by the 
circumstances. “Thank you. Pre- 
cious One,” he murmured. 

He returned to his cell only 
briefly before leaving the monastery 
altogether. It was set high in the 
foothills, its foundations biting into 
the primeval rock, but instead of 
taking the beaten track down to the 
valley, Tenzin set off westwards, 
following a broken path that took 
him higher into the mountains. 

A little more than three hours 
later, he stepped wearily onto a ridge 
and walked slowly across a bare 
rock apron to the entrance of his 
cave. It was chill at this height, but 
the exertion of his climb had kept 
him warm. He sat down and rested, 
then, anxious to begin, arranged his 
limbs in the lotus posture, ankles 
crossed on thighs. Almost automati- 
cally, his gaze sank to the tip of his 
nose, his breathing slowed, shal- 
lower and shallower. His body 
trembled twice, then locked into 
stillness. 

In the cave mouth, looking out 

152 



across a Himalayan valley, Tenzin 
meditated on the Yidam. 

Tenzin passed his old cell with- 
out so much as a sideways glance. 
He hesitated at his master’s door- 
way, then slipped quietly inside 
without knocking. Katsang Rim- 
poche knelt in prayer before the lit- 
tle shrine at the far side of the 
room. Tenzin waited. 

Some time later, Katsang Rim- 
poche rose and turned. His thin, 
lined features betrayed no surprise 
at seeing Tenzin. “I bid you wel- 
come, my son.” His voice was soft 
and dry, like dead leaves blowing 
across a barren plain. 

Tenzin bowed. “Forgive my in- 
terruption, Precious One. I have 
done as you instructed.” 

The dark eyes glittered into his 
soul. “What did I instruct you?” 
“To meditate on the Yidam, 
Master.” 

“And what wisdom have your 
meditations brought?” 

“They have brought to my mind 
the truth that the Yidam is a great 
and powerful deity. They have 
brought to my mind that His wrath 
is boundless as His power. Yet 
withal, there is much that He might 
teach me, for that is His nature.” 
The Lama nodded gravely. “It is 
good. Go now and begin your next 
task.” 

Tenzin waited. 

“You must conjure up the Yidam 
to appear to you,” added Katsang 
Rimpoche. 



GALAXY 




lliACH TOME was SO heavy, with its 
massive binding and protective 
wrappers of oiled cloth, that Tenzin 
had to carry them singly to his 
cave. It was the work of two days 
and it chafed him that so many 
hours were wasted. 

When the fifth and final volume 
had been laid carefully in its niche 
at the back of the cave, he lighted a 
butter lamp, tired though he was, 
and prepared to begin his studies 
right away. 

He took leaves from the books, 
one sheet at a time, carefully re- 
wrapping the remainder to protect 
them from the damp that seeped 
down the stone walls. 

He continued his studies, sleeping 
six hours in the twenty-four, for 
three months and eleven days. 

The books frightened him. 

It is necessary,” said the Pre- 
cious One, “that you are now in- 
itiated in the art of kyilkhor. The 
time is almost ripe for you to see 
the Yidam.” 

When he returned to his cave, 
Tenzin practiced the construction of 
the kyilkhor diligently, deviating 
not one fraction from the method 
his guru had taught him. He became 
skilled. 

One morning, by now certain of 
his abilities, Tenzin drew the kyil- 
khor on the cave floor using col- 
ored powders. Then he sank into 
the lotus posture and began to chant 
the formulae that Katsang Rimpoche 
had given him. 



He continued, without pause, 
throughout the day and deep into 
the evening. Because of his excite- 
ment, he slept only four hours that 
night. On the following morning he 
began his chant again. 

Somewhere towards the end of 
the fourth day, he reconstructed his 
kyilkhor. On the evening of the 
eighth day, the Yidam appeared. 



1 ENZiN STARED at the Shifting 
form above the kyilkhor. It 
stabilized with agonizing slowness. 
He chanted, as the Precious One 
had taught him. 

The shapes were alien, mind- 
warping. He clung to consciousness 
and chanted, watching space turn 
slowly inside out. A chill of fear 
ran through his body. Echoes re- 
verberated in the cave. 

The shifting forms solidified and 
Tenzin bowed deeply from the 
waist, thanking all his guardian 
gods the entity could not escape the 
kyilkhor. 

When he raised his head, the 
cave was empty in the flickering 
firelight. 

Well pleased, Tenzin settled 
down to sleep. 



lou ARE FAVORED,” Katsang 
Rimpoche told him gravely. “Few 
are honored in so short a time.” 
The old man stared past Tenzin, his 
eyes suddenly withdrawn. Tenzin 
waited, listening to the wind as it 
slid through cracks in the ancient

monastery walls. It was spring, but 
at this height the wind still carried 
chill messages and even the occa- 
sional snow flurry . 

The dark eyes focused. “What 
you experienced was not complete 
success, my son. Your spiritual pro- 
tector vanished in brief moments. It 
was — ” He paused, thoughtfully. 
“ — an encouragement: no more.” 

Tenzin waited. 

Surprisingly, Katsang Rimpoche 
sighed. “You must seek those dark 
secrets only the Yidam can reveal. 
And how can that be if He remains 
but for an instant?” 

Tenzin remained silent, his eyes 
fixed on the lips of the Precious 
One. 

“You must hold the Yidam 
within your kyilkhor,” Katsang 
Rimpoche went on. “You must strain 
your powers of concentration to 
their utmost. Build up in your mind 
a detailed picture of the Yidam, for 
in this way you will aid his man- 
ifestation. Practice diligently and 
without ceasing until you achieve 
the desired result.” 

Encouraged, Tenzin returned to 
his cave. 

After two months, Tenzin felt 
despair. 

The Yidam appeared rarely — late 
in the evening when fatigue had be- 
gun to dull his senses — and stayed 
only for an instant. 

Perhaps, he thought, the entity 
was just a figirient of the imagina- 

154 



tion, overheated by the sonorous 
chanting and relentless concentra- 
tion. Perhaps it had no more reality 
than a dream. 

One evening, for no apparent 
reason, the Yidam came and stayed. 

Tenzin went about his daily 
routine calmly. Each time he 
glanced towards the kyilkhor, he 
could see the Yidam. The sight had 
ceased to chill his 'soul, but the 
shifting planes of light around the 
entity disturbed him profoundly. 

When Tenzin looked directly at 
it, the Yidam remained immobile. 
When his attention was diverted, 
the creature moved about almost fit- 
fully within the kyilkhor. 

At night, the planes of light grew 
stronger, more disturbing. Within 
them, the entity was as visible as at 
noon. There were even times when 
it appeared to gain greater density. 

On the third day, when he was 
satisfied the Yidam would not fade, 
Tenzin left the cave to tell his holy 
master. 



Katsang rimpoche nodded. 
“Your progress is praise- 

worthy.” The glittering eyes fastened 
on Tenzin’s own. “But it is far from 
finished.” 

Tenxin waited. 

“The Yidam remains but a 
shadow. While this continues, you 
can never feel His power, obtain 

GALAXY 




full benefits from His protection. 
You must strive now to give Him 
substance. You must achieve greater 
degrees of concentration. You must 
pray to Him hourly until He favours 
you with His conversation and His 
blessing.” 

For the first time, Tenzin risked a 
direct question. “And then, Preci- 
ous One ?” 

The Lama hesitated. “There is a 
certain danger. When the Yidam 
achieves substance, the kyilkhor can 
no longer hold him.” 

Tenzin bowed wearily to the 
looming figure. His forehead 
touched the earth, passing through 
the Yidam’s feet as easily as if they 
had been a dream. 

He rose and went on impulse to 
prepare some buttered tea. Beyond 
the fire in his cave-mouth, snow 
was falling. Only a little higher up, 
the passes had already been blocked. 

In a house he could not see and 
had not seen for seven years, ser- 
vants would be storing up provi- 
sions for the winter. 

Tenzin sipped from the wooden 
bowl. He knew if he looked round, 
he would see the shifting planes that 
formed the Yidam. Yet the entity 
remained intangible as some product 
of his own imagination. 

Imagination. 

Tenzin set down his bowl. As he 
half turned towards the kyilkhor, 
the Yidam spoke. 

is finished. Master,” Tenzin 

THE YIDAM 



said. “The Yidam walks freely in 
my cave. I feel His feet with my 
forehead when I bow to Him. I feel 
the touch of His hand when He 
gives me His blessing.” 

“Do you hear His voice, my 
son?” asked Katsang Rimpoche. 

“Precious One, as clearly as a 
temple bell. His tones are fearful.” 
“You know his blessing?” 

“I know it. Precious One. When 
His hands are placed upon my head, 
fire pours through my soul. My 
body is strengthened, my mind is 
cleansed.” 

“It is good,” Katsang Rimpoche 
murmured. “But it is not finished. 
The Yidam can reveal to you the 
secrets of the Cosmos. Yet until He 
is prepared to walk with you from 
your retreat, your task can never be 
complete. With the Yidam at your 
side, you will become a great magi- 
cian or a holy sage. Until then, you 
are no better than a prisoner in your 
cave.” 

The blizzards ceased, the raging 
winds became a memory. Above 
the foothills, snow still lay in a 
crisp, white carpet and ice crests 
glittered on the Himalayan boulders. 

Tenzin squatted thirty yards out- 
side his cave, heart pounding with 
excitement. He watched the dark 
‘O’ of the cave mouth with utter 
concentration. Faint lights sparkled 
inside, like sun glinting off ice crys- 
tals. 

There was a curious straining in 
the air, as if the atmosphere was 

155 




trying to accomodate the meshing of 
two alien dimensions. 

The Yidam emerged. For just the 
briefest instant its form flickered in 
the sunlight, then solidified. 

Tenzin heard the sound of its ap- 
proach, felt the actual vibration of 
its steps through the apron of 
primeval rock beneath his feet. 

The Yidam left no marks in the 
snow. 

Katsang rimpoche bowed. 
“There is no more 1 can teach you. 
You have won the favour of a pro- 
tector far mightier than 1.” 

It was a gesture of dismissal, but 
Tenzin sat still, locked by his inner 
conflict. The Lama regarded him 
impassively. Abruptly Tenzin 
blurted, “I have sinned. Precious 
One!” 

“How have you sinned?” 

“I doubt the reality of the 
Yidam!” 

Katsang Rimpoche frowned. “Can 
you not see Him?” 

“Yes, Precious One.” 

“Can you not touch him?” 

“Yes, Precious One.” 

“Is He not solid and material as 
the universe around you?” 

“He is. Precious One.” 

“Your doubts are blasphemous,” 
the Lama said. “They must be 
rooted out. Double and redouble 
your efforts to resolve them. Spend 
your days in meditation until this 
has been achieved.” 

Tenzin left the Yidam near a 



boulder some distance from the 
monastery. The ground was wet un- 
derfoot with melted snow. He 
walked slowly, head bowed. 

The dark eyes glistened, reading 
his expression. “You are troubled,” 
the guru murmured. 

“I cannot resolve my doubts!” 
Tenzin exclaimed bluntly. “I have 
spent the winter months in medita- 
tion and my doubts are stronger 
still. Master, I am now convinced 
the Yidam is a product of my im- 
agination.” 

“Is there no way I can shake this 
strange conviction?” 

Tenzin shook his head. “Master, 
I have passed beyond all doubt. Al- 
though the Yidam is as solid as the 
universe around me, I know 1 am a 
prey to mirage.” He waited, pre- 
pared for the Lama’^s anger. 

Katsant Rimpoche smiled. “You 
have learned your lesson well. The 
Yidam did indeed spring from your 
mind and will, when you will it, 
sink into your mind again.” 

Fear clutched Tenzin’s heart. 
“And the universe!” he whispered. 
“The universe that seems as solid 
as the Yidam?” 

The Lama nodded. “That too 
will sink into the mind when you no 
longer need it.” 

When Tenzin passed the rock on 
his way back to the cave, the 
Yidam was no longer there. 

He stared thoughtfully at the 
boulder, then up at the high 
Himalayan peaks. Under his gaze, 
their solid outlines flickered. ★

GALAXY 





Dear Mr. Geis: 

Many thanks for helping hoth the author 
and the reader viz the "U-Novel” remarks 
you made in December’s "If’. 

I buy an author twice, and, should I ex- 
perience non-entertainment, I simply 
write him off my list and he’s never ever 
missed — at least by me. 

Asimov is lettered, I don’t know about 
Vance, but they both know that it’s a 
buyer’s market. Never have these gents, 
among others, failed to entertain me. Con- 
sequently I’m attracted to the names, in 
themselves. 

It’s unfair to term them "hack writers” 
but I’m not a writer by trade so I cannot 
conjure up a more prpper term. 

I still marvel over the arrogance, the 
wretched arrogance of poverty, encoun- 
tered in my “Grenwich Village” period. 
Unsuccessful writers froth at the idea that 
writing is a sale of a service. They don’t 
want to know about that concept. Unsuc- 
cessful writers get very vituperative and 
noxious when reminded of economics. 

You’ve done all concerned a tremendous 
favor. If you influence some author to 
forgo “suffering” and if you help to give 
me a greater array of entertainment it’s all 
been worth while. I expect Asimov will 
laugh at Alters remarks before he asks the 
maid to serve tea. Vance, I believe, will 
simply shrug at the obvious and return to 
his typewriter or whatever bizarre vices he 
may be perusing at the moment. 

So, gentlemen, I leave you to go run a 



subway train (my trade). I’ll not bother 
you or interfere with you until we meet 
again for our bi-weekly moment of truth at 
the bookrack.

Dick’s reply: 

The "My art for my art's sake" writers 
point out that 75-95% of the fiction on the 
stands are of the "commerciaT writing ilk, 
so what are we complaining about? Of 
course, 90% of that is junk. .which leaves 
precious little really good dramatic, excit- 
ing fiction for us readaholics. 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

I would like to compliment you on the re- 
surgance of Galaxy, which, for the first time 
in years, I am buying and enjoying. The 
February issue was particularly fine, espe- 
cially the second installment of Zelazny’s 
The Sign of the Unicorn. Zelazny has the 
ability to be entertaining while still saying 
something — -stylistically or thematically— that 
transcends parallel universes, dragons, and 
court intrigues. He’s a lot of fun at a time 
when many writers aren’t too much fun. 1 
can see the need for entertainment and litera- 
ture in the science fiction genre; but I respect 
a man who can do both. 

I would like to say a few things about Tak 
Hallus’ “The Linguist.” It was a funny story 
with a good thematic twist that I enjoyed. I 
have only one beef. A Hereford is not neces- 
sarily a steer. Through several personal in- 
terviews with the Herefords in our pasture, 1 
have discovered several steers. But there are 
also some pretty spry bulls romping among 
our cows; and since we have a couple of 
calves wobbling around, too, 1 have con- 
cluded their actions are not mere shows of 
male ego. Hereford is a breed of cattle, like 
Guernsey or Angus. Only when chromo- 
somes and man conspire to make one so, is a 
Hereford designated a steer. Okay? 

Sincerely, 
Jerry Meredith

Dear Mr. Baen: 

I enjoyed J.A. Lawrence’s “The Persis- 
tence of Memory” in the November 
Galaxy because it was one of the first 
stories I have read which attempted to 
give a scientific explanation of the belief 
many people have in reincarnation. I 
would, however, like to discuss 
Lawrence’s explanation in light of what is 
known about the behavior of DNA in re- 
plicating cells. 

Lawrence’s major premise was that a 
high intensity magnetic field present at 
the proper instant in cell division could 
cause the bonding in the DNA molecule 
to become skewed. This model he uses to 
explain the ability of the Nyen-Hwa to 
remember a past she/they could not have 
lived. Lawrence then explains that this 
ability could not be passed on to the 
offspring because “when the chain parted 
again, it would resume normal bonding”. 

What Lawrence apparently failed to 
consider is that if this askewed bonding 
occurred during the third cell division of 
the embryo (as stated in the story), the 
next cell division (the fourth) would cor- 
rect the error. As the DNA is replicated, 
the original bonds between the strands are 
broken before the “new” DNA is synthe- 
sized. The new strands of DNA would be 
faithful replicas of the “old” without the 
askew bonding error. This, as Lawrence 
stated, would account for the trait not 
being inheritable, but it also would mean 
the trait would not be passed to even one 
cell generation. 

Therefore, unless the intense magnetic 
field were present at the proper instant 
during each succeeding cell division until 
cortical development were completed (ap- 
proximately the end of the fetal stage 
— perhaps 30 cell divisions as a guesti- 
mate), or at least at the crucial stage when 
the cells begin to irreversably differentiate 
into the cortical cells (which happens well 
beyond the third division), the ability to 
remember the past would not have ap- 
peared in the Nyen-Hwa. 

158 



Unfortunately, even if the magnetic 
field were maintained at Precisely the cor- 
rect time for the required number of cell 
divisions, the askew bonding would not 
persist as the DNA were transcribed to 
form RNA. RNA is the molecule which 
carries the information stored in the DNA 
into the cytoplasm where it is decoded. 
When RNA is produced, the DNA helices 
are decoupled and one DNA strand is 
copied. The mistake in bonding would not 
be carried in the single stranded RNA and 
thus would not be decoded in whatever 
way memories are decoded. 

Lawrence’s was an inventive and 
thought-provoking story. I hope someone 
takes his lead (maybe even Lawrence) and 
tries again to work with the "belief in 
reincarnation” in such a rational manner. 

Sincerely, 
Billie Jean Grounds

Dear Jim; 

First, I want to congratulate you on 
what you have done, and are doing, to 
Galaxy and If. One cover in particular, that of 
the October issue of//, by “Pini,” is one of the 
best I have ever seen. Pini, has real talent. 

I also enjoy the articles by Jerry Pour- 
nelle. The mixture of good fiction and 
good articles such as his makes excellent 
reading. 

One thing I would like to comment on. 
The letter by Mark Terry, in the De- 
cember issue of Galaxy. He says, and I 
quote, “I really do not mind when an au- 
thor inserts a bit of the occult or ESP, but 
wish he would take care to make it believ- 
able”, unquote. I do not disagree with this 
statement and I thoroughly enjoy good fic- 
tion based on ESP in its various forms and 
occasionally some of the occult, like Andre 
Norton’s Witchworlds series. However, 
the point I wish to make is, that actual 
ESP quite often is unbelievable. I carried 
on a series of ESP experiments, with a 
group of friends, for about ten years, test- 
ing every form we could think of and in 

GALAXY 




every way we could think of. I’ll guarantee 
you, many of our results were unbelieva- 
ble, although the greatest disappointment 
was that they were inconsistent. Like one 
week results were out of this world, the 
next, nothing. In other words, it was not 
something that could be turned on and off 
like a hght bulb, but only when conditions 
were just right, and in all the time we ran 
the tests, we never discovered what it 
took for “conditions” to be right. Our best 
results always were unexpected. One thing 
I learned though. A very high percentage 
of people tested showed signs of latent 
abilities they would hardly believe, mostly 
telepathy. 

In line with this, I recently read a book 
called “The Amazing World of Kresken” 
published by Avon Books. Even discount- 
ing a lot of it as publicity stunts, this man 
has developed more control over telepathy 
than anyone I have ever heard of. I would 
highly recommend it to anyone interested 
in ESP. 

Best wishes, 

Ed Woods

Ed Woods 

See this month's science article. ESP is no 
longer in need of proof— just further study. 

One for Dick: 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

The many good reasons for castrating, or 
neutering (the euphemism is “altering”) 
male cats include improving their disposi- 
tions, increasing their life-spans, removing 
the source of their frustrations (if confined 
indoors), and decreasing their odor. 

Therefore, (though Geis is so cute when 
he's being vicious!) may 1 suggest that 
someone alter Alter? 

Yours sincerely, 
Maureen Leshendok

DIRECTIONS 



And one for me: 

Dear Jim: 

Phucking is phun. No doubt about it. I’ve 
been convinced of this for years and have 
practiced it at every opportunity. But I’ll be 
danged if I want to read about the operation, 
especially not in IF-Galaxy. If I should ever 
want that sort of reading. Brother Hefner can 
supply it or I can make a trip to Portland and 
visit one of the “adult” bookstores that cater 
to delayed adolescents of all ages. 

What brought all this on is M. A. Bart- 
ter’s Be Ye Perfect in your current issue. I 
am not overly fond of little blondes, to begin 
with, and I don’t give a good goddam 
whether IT goes IN and UP or Down and 
Out. 

For crissake, Jim, let’s knock off the crap 
and get back to science fiction. Either that or 
change the name of your mag and compete 
with Playboy. Or I’ll be tempted to say: UP 
YOURS. 

Most sincerely yours, 
Virgil Hays
