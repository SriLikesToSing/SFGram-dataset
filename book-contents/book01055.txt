HYPERSPEED READING 

... for me meant Increasing my reading speed from 
600 to 1800 words per minute, enough to finish a novel 
in half an hour, to triple the number of technical jour- 
nals and reports I read. Much to my surprise my com- 
prehension went up and studying became easier aa I 
enjoyed reading more. 

1 went from normal reading speed to hyperspeed 
reading in thirty hours of intensive reading practice at 
a leading reading clinic, and immediately thought how 
wonderful It would be for people who don’t have the 
time or opportunity to tabe such improvement work to 
do it at home, for several hours a day. 

Ever since then 1 have gathered materials which are 
proven, widely used and time-tested In clinics, schools 
and reading centers but are adaptable to use by adults 
working at home without supervision. You will imme- 
diately Increase your reading speed with them if vour 
reading habits are correct but can be acccelerated. with 
practice. 

If you have reading difficulties they will be brought 
out in the diagnostic reading test we include and will 
analyze with^recommendatlcms at no extra cost to you. 

The kit Includes a reading rate accelerator with cards, 
two books of practice materials with technical exercises 
that test reading sDeed and comprehension, and a book- 
let on hyperspeed reading. 

Price of kit Including reading rate accelerator, basic 
manual, technical reading manual, and discussion of 
hyperspeed reading plus diagnostic reading test with 
analysis. Kit Rl $24.00 postpaid 



Electric Model of a Nerve: 

. the Nervous system behaves in many respects 
as an electrical network — so much so that a rela- 
tively simple analog duplicates eighteen functions 
of the nervous system. Designed by Dr. Walter

MBA CULPA 



O WING to circumstances en- 
tirely within my control, a 
recent editorial of mine got (jus- 
tifiably) clobbered. I repeated, 
with innocent merriment, an 
anecdote about Rex Stout, mys- 
tery writer and amateur gardener, 
winning a $100 bet by shrewd- 
ly slitting a row of kernels out 
of young corn to prove that cobs 
do not invariably have odd num- 
bers of rows of kernels. 

Some anecdote. It caused fist 
fights, arguments and the most 
caustic language I’ve ever seen 
allowed in the U.S. mail — and 
one chap, Albert N. Walker of 
No. Sacramento, Calif., lost $10 
in a bet. I have the proof that 
the bet was lost fairly: he sent 
me a cob with ten rows. 

However, I didn’t make up the 
anecdote. I read it in a magazine 
intended for those who either live 
in New York or think it’s a nice 
place to visit, and thus is about 
anywhere but New York. It is 
also notorious for its hostility 
toward science fiction. If for no 
other reason, I should have 
known better than to repeat one 
of its items without checking 
first. 

So I’m checking. Unfortunate- 
ly, the only immediate source is 
the Encyclopedia Americana, 



1940 edition. Here are some pas- 
sages that astonished at least me. 
(If you lose bets on these say- 
sos, Mr. Walker, please take it 
up with the Americana Corp.) 

“Corn is America’s most im- 
portant crop. It is grown on as 
great an acreage and has a value 
greater than that of wheat, oats, 
barley, rye, and rice combined . 

‘With the introduction of hy- 
brid sorts (in 1930), corn grow- 
ers have become more dependent 
upon seedsmen, and now the 
average grower saves less seed 
corn . There has been an enor- 
mous amount of information put 
out on the kind of seed corn to 
pick. Much of this is of little prac- 
tical value . 

“Along with the picking of 
seed corn from the field, seed 
corn testing is becoming a lost 
art . Ever since 1910, the rag 
doll tester has been pre-eminent. 
It is a simple homemade tester 
that utilizes sheeting or similar 
material for holding a representa- 
tive number (6) kernels of seed 
from each ear to be tested. An 
average rag doll will hold about 
40 ears and when properly pre- 
pared, rolled and soaked in luke- 
warm water will give readings, 
after the seed is germinated, that

OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Looking For Us, Professor? 

"Hmm, yes. I was just cogitating upon the causes of GALAXY 
Science Fiction's phenomenal growth in popularity." 

"And that needs an explanation. Professor?" 

"From a socio-psychological viewpoint, most definitely. To 
what do you attribute the constant increase of interest?" 

"Well . let's try it this way. Professor. Suppose we ask the 
questions and you answer them." 

"So? A bit unusual, but go right ahead." 

"Do you think atomic doom is the only future for mankind?" 

"Not exactly, but the newspapers and the commentators—" 

"Of course. Well, we SHOW other possible futures. Do you 
believe we will be able to leave the Earth?" 

"Eventually, perhaps. But not in our lifetime." 

"We don't agree. Assuming you're right, though, isn't that all 
the more reason to want to know what we'll find on other 
planets. Professor?" 

"I think I see what you mean." 

"Can we achieve immortality?" 

"Ah. Hum. I've often wondered." 

"And travel to different eras in time?" 

"That would be exciting." 

"And you've been trying to discover why GALAXY is growing 
so popular? Every idea we've mentioned— and a lot more, be- 
sides— is treated dramatically and “ividly in GALAXY! You really 
live them!"

It was a wall in space . with no way to go

it was those outside who were the prisoners! 



Illustrated by WOOD 



A LOUSY mission. Of course, 
it was a volunte'er (i.e., 
suicide) mission, and for 
that you take what comes. They 
may wine you and dine you and 
honor you and your tribe for 
three generations coming and go- 
ing, in the days before you start. 
But once you’re on your way, 
you can’t expect it to be a pleas- 
ure. Everything about suicide is 
death, not just the final part. 

Potter picked his cuticles and 
didn’t know he was doing it, even 
while he was looking you straight 
in the eye, talking to you at the 
time. Try shipping out with that. 
That’s what bothered me the 
most, anyway. 

Most of the others seemed to 




8 



CAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



be bugged by Donato. He had a 
psychosomatic cough that passed 
all the preflight medics for the 
simple reason that he had never 
had such a thing before, probably 
because he had never gone out 
to die before. Me, I guess I have 
soaked up enough of that “pro- 
found compassion” of the Luanae 
to defend me against that kind 
of annoyance. But Potter the 
Picker now — that got to me, I 
admit it. 

Little Donato was always try- 
ing to please. Some people are 
annoying because once in a while 
they just don’t go out of their 
way to make things a little hap- 
pier for anyone else. Donato hit 
the other extreme, always mak- 
ing way, never disagreeing, for- 
ever finding some way to help or 
get a cushion or move back or 
bring or say or not-say whatever 
anyone else might want, until 
you wanted to scuttle the ship 
just so it would take him with 
the lot of you. 

The main trouble was, he was 
so helpful he never gave you any- 
thing to complain about. Time 
after time, I would see one or the 
other of the crew suddenly wheel 
on him out of a dead silence and 
roar at him to get the hell out. 

“Why, sure, friend,” Donato 
would always say, and smile, and 
get the hell out, leaving whoever 
it was beating himself on the 
temples. 

10 



DOTTER was a specialist in 
field mechanics and Donato 
was a top ballistics man. England 
was an ugly man with big ears 
and wet eyes who kept to himself 
pretty much, only he ate loud. 
He was an expert in missile con- 
trol. And I’m Palmer; I heard 
there was a man in Alpha Sigma 
IV once who knew more about 
trans-spatial stress than I do, but 
I don’t believe it. 

The four of us had four dif- 
ferent ideas for breaking the 
Luanae Barrier and that’s what 
we were on our way to do. All 
four ideas were pretty far-fetched 
and the odds were much in favor 
of the Barrier’s getting us, but it 
had to be done. After everything 
reasonable has been tried on 
something that must be done but 
can’t be done, you have to start 
calling in the crackpots. I had 
to bring along my perfectly valid 
theories with the three crack- 
pots because it was the only way 
they would ever get tried. 

And that was the expedition 
personnel. The others were just 
operations. A skipper, Capt. 
Steev, strictly ferryboat, who 
knew everything he had to know 
about running the ship and get- 
ting her there, and didn’t know, 
didn’t care, wouldn’t talk about 
anything else. Some of the others 
griped about the kind of skip>p>er 
we had, but not me. He had to 
be expendable and he was. He 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



had to know his job and he did. 
So? 

The utility monkey was funny 
for about half an hour of any- 
body’s time, and forever after 
that just unpleasant to have 
around. He was sort of mis- 
shapen, with a head much too 
big for his body and a left leg 
with too much bounce in it. It’s 
been so many hundreds of years, 
I guess, since anyone had any- 
thing drastic wrong physically 
that nobody can get used to it 
any more. You know how to be 
polite about it when you do en- 
counter it, and back home you 
know how to forget you saw it 
pretty thoroughly, but on a 
spacecan you never get the 
chance. 

Personally, I think we should 
have shipped without a utility 
man. I don’t know if I feel so 
strongly about it that I’d have 
done the dirty work on the ship 
myself, but maybe one of the 
others would. I don’t care how 
much humanity progresses, there 
is always a little room somewhere 
for the unskilled hand, lifting 
and mopping and cleaning out 
the sewer lines when something 
gets stuck. This monkey we had 
went by the name of Nils Blum, 
and nobody paid much attention 
to him. 

And then we had the unem- 
ployed CG. Did you ever hear of 
an unemployed crew’s girl — on a 

THE POD IN THE BARRIER 



ship? I don’t mean kicking 
around the spaceports waiting to 
ship out, unemployed that way. 
I mean right there aboard, she 
had nothing to do. 

CGs as a whole are a dowdy 
bunch. There’s no point in put- 
ting cute clothes, cute tricks and 
heady perfume aboard a space- 
can. You don’t need to stimu- 
late anything; that takes care of 
itself as time goes by. They keep 
themselves clean and wait around 
till they’re needed. They’re a 
thick-skinned, slow-witted lot be- 
cause there’s no sense in sensi- 
tivity in their line. It just makes 
trouble. 

^^HIS Virginia we shipped, she 
came from the bottom of the 
underside of the sump. She was 
everything that distinguishes a 
CG from a real Earthside female 
woman. She had a wide face that 
was closed and bland as a bank- 
vault door on the Sabbath, and 
a build that was neither this nor 
that but sort of statistically there. 
With a normal personality, or 
none at all, she might have had 
a job to do, and would have done 
it. But with the personality she 
had . 

Well, at first you just didn’t 
like her, and after a while you 
couldn’t abide her, and finally 
you got the feeling about her that 
she was a lower animal, that you 
couldn’t stand what the others 

11 



might think of you if you went 
near her. There was a lot of dif- 
ference of opinion aboard on a 
lot of subjects, but not on that 
one. 

So that’s what we had, believe 
it or not, an unemployed CG. 

I read someplace about an Arc- 
tic explorer back in the days 
where the poles of Old Earth 
were covered with ice. He used 
to bring along the ugliest woman 
he could find to cook. Her other 
function was to inform him when 
he’d been away from civilization 
too long, which she did by begin- 
ning to look good to him. Well, 
maybe, given time enough, we’d 
have found something for this 
Virginia to do. But given that 
much time, we’d all be dead. 

Oh, she was a great help 
aboard, Virginia was. 

That personality. I thought a 
lot about that personality of hers, 
just because on a long haul you 
have time to think a lot about 
everything ... I knew a kid in 
school who had a face so insult- 
ing, so all-fired arrogant when it 
was relaxed that the teachers 
used to throw him out of the 
class just for sitting there. At 
least until they learned it was 
only physical and had him re- 
modeled. Well, maybe Virginia’s 
personality was something like 
that. Maybe she couldn’t help it. 

She had a way of carrying a 
cloud of what Potter once called 

12 



“retroactive doubt.” When she 
was anywhere near you, you 
breathed it. You’d say something 
and she would repeat it, and by 
the way she did it — I can’t de- 
scribe it at all, but I’m telling 
you the truth — by the way she 
did it, she made whatever you’d 
said into a falsehood. Sometimes 
it suddenly sounded like a lie 
and sometimes like a mistake and 
sometimes like something you 
could be expected to believe be- 
cause you were ignorant. I mean 
just repeating your own words. 

You’d say, “Back home, I’ve 
got a silver-headed walking 
stick,” and she’d say, “Yeah, 
you’ve got a silver-headed walk- 
ing stick,” in that dull flat drone 
of hers, and, by damn, you’d 
find yourself arguing with her 
that you did have one. I mean 
fighting, defending yourself, the 
way you only can when you 
doubt something yourself. Then 
she’d go away and you’d sit and 
stew about the walking stick, 
wondering where it was you last 
saw it, wondering if you actual- 
ly did have it any more, if the 
head of it was real silver. 

It didn’t have to be something 
that was important at all; she 
could make you feel that way. 
When it was important . ship- 
mate, better not mention it 
around her. I think you could tell 
her your name and she’d make 
you doubt it. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



As a matter of fact, now I 
think of it, she did just that to 
me, the day I first saw her 
(which is traditionally the day 
after upship). I walked up to 
her in the messhall and said, 
“My name’s Palmer,” and she 
looked at me without blinking 
and said flatly, “Your name’s 
Palmer,” and made me say, be- 
fore I could stop myself, “No — 
really it is,” and then skulk off 
feeling damn strange. 

Vj^E’D taken off with a null- 
” gray tug and slipped into 
second-order matrix within six 
hours — all very fast and pain- 
less, thanks to the Luanae. Both 
devices were theirs, and so was 
the ship’s power plant, and so 
was the sub-etheric communica- 
tion we could get loud and clear 
for almost four full days after 
upship. Do you know how far 
that would be in miles? Here, 
figure it out— four days is enough 
to take you halfway to Sirius, 
and that’s a powerful long reach 
for a communicator phasing out 
of normal space and finding your 
receiver. 

I recall especially that fourth 
day’s bulletins, because we all 
gathered around to soak them up 
and chew them thoroughly. We 
knew that we’d hear nothing else 
from Earth Worlds from there on 
for the six ship-weeks it took 
us to get out to the Luanae Bar- 

THE POD IN THE BARRIER 



rier, way out on the other side 
of the Coalsack. 

We cheered the whiffleball 
scores and the chess results and 
laughed too loud at the human- 
interest bit about the kid who 
brought the Nova Mars stinkdog 
into school; and then there was 
the last real news we heard, that 
Chicago had been frozen from 
Northern Ontario Parish clear 
south to the Joplin city limits, 
back on Old Earth. 

Everybody tsk-tsked. 

“Well,” said Potter, looking at 
his finger, “I guess there’s no 
other way.” 

“But people always get killed 
in a freeze,” said big-eared Eng- 
land. 

“More people get killed in a 
riot,” I remember saying. 

About then, the signal faded, 
very abruptly, as it does when 
you get out of range in sub-space, 
and we all sat around worrying 
a bit. 

It was funny, that news of all 
news being the last we heard. 
It was like a nudge, a send-off. 
A reminder. 

Old Earth wasn’t the only 
place where there were riots, not 
by a sight. Of eighteen planets 
in the two so-called Earth 
Galaxies, only Ragnarok and Lu- 
na-Luna were not bulging at 
the seams, and they’d be as bad 
as the others in a generation. By 
and large, people behaved them- 

13 



selves . but there were so many 
of them! The law of averages 
dictated that, in that number, 
there had to be so many trouble- 
makers, there were bound to be 
so many riots — and there had 
to be more troublemakers and 
riots all the time. 

Unless we broke the Luanae 
Barrier. 

We owe the Luanae a lot. As I 
said before, a good deal of our 
most advanced technology is 
built on transmissions from the 
Luanae. A very old people, an- 
cient before old Sol the First 
was a sun. Wise and compas- 
sionate. That was the real cliche: 
the compassionate Luanae. True 
enough, though. 

No one had ever seen them, of 
course — the Barrier took care of 
that. No one understood the 
exact method of their transmis- 
sions, though they tried their best 
to explain. You’d get in range 
and then there it was, they were 
talking to you, inside your head. 
What they said was true — that 
you could bank on, swear by, 
hang your hat or your life on. 

COME things have to be 
^ proved. But not an5rthing the 
Luanae said. You might not be- 
lieve it if you heard about some- 
thing they said, from me, say. 
But go hear it from them — you’ll 
know it’s so. Never in the three 
hundred years of contact had 

14 



anything they said turned out 
to be anything but exactly— real- 
ly exactly— so. 

They say that at first humani- 
ty took it with a dose of salts — 
we are a suspicious species. But 
although the Luanae couldn’t 
give us the specs of a machine 
like theirs — they insisted that 
their thought transmitter was 
only a machine — they were able 
to describe an odd little recorder 
that would play back and 
“sound” like the original. When a 
few million of those had been 
made and distributed, there 
wasn’t any suspicion any more. 
It just blew away. 

But population-pressure riot- 
ing isn’t as easy to dispose of as 
inbred suspicion. Put enough peo- 
ple in a limited area and you’ll 
have trouble. Put too much in the 
same area and — look out. Now 
we had sixteen worlds with too 
much humanity, and two more 
with almost enough to start 
trouble. And all we could do was 
watch and feel, and freeze whole 
sections when the thing boiled 
over. 

After each freeze, the United 
Planet men would spread 
through the . countryside, picking 
up the mangled corpses from 
ground-cars and aircraft which 
had smashed up when everyone 
blacked out, and making the mil- 
lions of others comfortable where 
they lay. They’d wake up in due 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



course, with no sense of time 
passed, but the dead would have 
been long buried and the trouble- 
makers located and treated, and 
the immediate causes of the riot, 
whatever they might be (it didn’t 
take much) adjudicated and put 
right. 

It was generally suspected that 
the UP boys declared riot and 
froze sections on somewhat less 
excuse than they really needed, 
but most people didn’t object. 
At least it kept a few million 
people, each time, from breed- 
ing any more for six to eight 
months. But nobody denied that 
this was pure stopgap. 

As to halting reproduction al- 
together for a while, the sugges- 
tion came up monotonously in 
the Council sessions and was as 
monotonously knocked down. 
Enforced sterility is counter to 
the most basic of civil rights, and 
the Earth Worlds would die be- 
fore they would relinquish any 
basic right. 

They were dying, too. 

And there, hanging just out of 
reach, were the Luanae Earths — 
eight fine Earth-type planets 
circling three suns in Galaxy 
Three. Eight beautiful worlds, 
ready and waiting; we wanted 
them and the Luanae wanted us 
to have them. And all we could 
do was watch them swing by 
and feel wistful, because of the 
Barrier. 

THE POD IN THE BARRIER 



T he Luanae are not terres- 
trial. As far as can be under- 
stood, they have a boron metabo- 
lism and compete in no way with 
us hydrocarbon types. They need 
nothing from us and wouldn’t 
take it if they did need it. 

When they say they have those 
worlds to give us, when they say 
the worlds are suitable, and they 
say for sure that those are the 
only planets left in this entire 
quadrant of the Universe — why, 
you can bet on it. (They’re the 
ones who found Luna-Luna and 
Ragnarok for us, when the 
Earth Worlds had despaired of 
ever finding another terrestrial 
planet.) We also have their as- 
surance that in the other quad- 
rants are literally thousands of 
terrestrial planets; but we will 
need a totally new technology to 
reach them, and that will take 
us maybe four centuries to ac- 
quire, even with their help. 

Well, the Earth Worlds 
wouldn’t last four centuries with- 
out the Luanae planets. With 
them, though — with them, it 
might be done. All we had to do 
was reach them. All we had to 
do was penetrate the Barrier. 

The Barrier was a sphere in 
space — not a thing, exactly, just 
a place which could be repre- 
sented on a cosmimap as a 
sphere. It was a fair-sized sphere; 
it englobed a third of the Luanae 
Galaxy, including, of course, the 

15 



three little Luanae home-planets 
and the eight lovely, unreachable 
Luanae Earths. 

All it did, that Barrier, was to 
draw a line. Anything outside of 
it was left strictly alone. Any- 
thing penetrating it was instantly 
tracked, hunted and smashed by 
Luanae missiles. And anything 
that got cute enough to duck in- 
side and out again was de- 
stroyed by the Barrier itself, 
which had the simple ability of 
reversing the terrene-sign of' a 
random third of the atoms in 
any matter it touched. 

You can imagine what hap- 
pened to anything from a micro- 
meteorite to a sun that got ex- 
posed to it. Shot through and 
through with contra-terrene mat- 
ter. Disappeared in a single fero- 
cious flash. 

The Luanae Galaxy was dis- 
covered three hundred years ago 
by a creaky old Earth survey 
ship powered by Teller-formula 
atomics and a primitive subspace 
drive which barely quadrupled 
effective light-velocity. 

The first thing the ship — it 
was called the Luanae, after its 
skipper’s wife and daughter, both 
of whom were named Luana — 
the first thing they saw was the 
Luanae Galaxy, a long narrow 
elliptical one with a dark band, 
the perfect arc of a circle, a thir4 
of the way down the long axis. 
It looked artificial, so they hob- 

16 



bled over there to investigate. 

It was artificial, all right. It 
was the Barrier, or, rather, the 
segment of space through which 
the Barrier had removed all im- 
pinging matter. And when they 
got within a dozen light-years of 
it, they were in range of the be- 
ings who came to be known by 
the same name as the ship and 
the galaxy — the Luanae. 

They said Stop. 

They said it simultaneously 
inside the heads of everyone 
aboard. They said it with that 
encasement of utter truth and 
total believability. They said it 
(they told us later) with an au- 
tomatic machine set up eons ago, 
to warn away any intelligent life 
from their Barrier. But when the 
ship Luanae responded (by stop- 
ping), it wasn’t any machine that 
spoke next. The strange creatures 
set up such a welcome, such a 
warm, admiring, congratulatory 
flood of thought that they say 
all hands looked at each other 
in amazement and started to- 
weep. 

A ND along with the welcome— 
a warning. Don’t come any 
closer. 

They threw a few million 
cubic meters of rubble up from 
the inside of the Barrier and let 
the astonished crew watch the 
near margins of the invisible Bar- 
rier light up with a hellish three- 

6AIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



hour show of destruction. They 
urged experiment, suggesting that 
the survey ship throw something 
at the Barrier. 

The ship did. Whatever mat- 
ter penetrated was overtaken 
and destroyed by what appeared 
to be tiny hunting missiles. What- 
ever matter was angled through 
the Barrier’s skin, so that it would 
cut a chord and emerge again, 
splashed into flame as it left. The 
men on the ship knew, down to 
the marrow, that they were wel- 
come — thirstily, ardently wel- 
come. 

And they knew that they were 
warned. 

"^HE ship hung outside the 
Barrier for over a year, set- 
ting down what turned out to 
be the greatest treasure ever 
brought home by a vessel since 
time began. Knowledge — the 
knowledge that put cold-fusion 
power plants on all the Earth 
planets, in all the factories. New 
designs. New principles of mathe- 
matics and spatial mechanics. 
New methods, new ideas, much 
of it material Earth possibly 
might have discovered for itself 
in a thousand years, most of it 
material we never could have 
found unaided. 

And every bit of it was valid. 
Every bit of it held out the 
promise of more, once we had as- 
similated this incredible cargo. 



When the survey ship Luanae 
reached the Earth Worlds, they 
say that the suspicion was thicker 
than anyone alive today could 
readily understand. They say 
they were going to court-martial 
the skipper for wasting all that 
time out there making up stories. 
And they say there was a pow- 
erful movement to suppress 
everything they brought back, 
out of fear that the new tech- 
nology might in some way be a 
Trojan horse. 

But sheer cussed human 
curiosity got the better of all that 
and, though they started slowly, 
it wasn’t too long before the 
Luanae devices and principles 
proved themselves out — spectac- 
ularly. 

And in a few years, humanity 
was back again. In force. The 
main idea was to breach the Bar- 
rier — peaceably if possible, but 
breach it. Most of the ships, most 
of the men, did not make the at- 
tempt, so great was the impact of 
the Luanae truth and fellow feel- 
ing. 

Some did try, though, ramming, 
bombing, bringing up hyper-mag- 
netic generator ships to try warp- 
ing the intangible structure of the 
Barrier. All failed; those who 
touched it died. Whenever that 
happened, there was a great 
soundless cry of mourning from 
the Luanae, but the Barrier re- 
mained. 



THE POD IN THE BARRIER 



17 



Tl^HEN the survey ship dis- 
” covered them, the Luanae 
had explained simply and clear- 
ly why the Barrier was there and 
why it stayed. It seemed tdo 
simple a story, and buried as it 
was in such a mass of other data, 
it was overlooked or disbelieved. 
Mind you, that was before the 
Luanae had been recorded, be- 
fore the human millions could 
“hear” for themselves what a 
transmission from them was real- 
ly like. Probably the Luanae 
realized this; at any rate, the 
story of the Barrier was the firsf 
Luanae recording to be widely 
distributed and its impact was 
huge. 

Such a simple story ... a peo- 
ple in some ways like humanity, 
perhaps a little swifter techno- 
logically, perhaps in some ways 
less demanding . well, they 
lived a good deal longer, took a 
good deal less from the land to 
keep themselves alive. 

They had some things to be 
proud of — an art that can only 
be imagined outside the Barrier, 
and music of a kind. They did 
“send” some of their literature, as 
you know . ah. 

Then they had a number of 
things to be ashamed of. Some 
wars, big ones. Three times they 
all but destroyed themselves, and 
climbed back up again. Then 
there was a long flowering, which 
seemed like something good. 



something fine. They developed 
a compassion, a philosophy of re- 
spect for the living and harmony 
with the laws of the Universe — 
more than a religion, more than 
simply a way of life and thought. 
Through it, a good many things 
became unnecessary to them and 
they forgot they had hands . 

When they were attacked 
from space (this happened count- 
less thousands of years ago), they 
could not defend themselves at 
all. They had forgotten the 
largest part of their fabulous 
technology; their machines were 
corroded, their skills had died, 
and worst of all, they had for- 
gotten how to organize, how to be 
many men under one man’s 
hand — for the duration. 

So they were enslaved. 

They broke their chains at 
length — at some thirty thousand 
years’ length. When they had 
driven out the invader, and fol- 
lowed him and destroyed him and 
all his worlds, they were a fright- 
ened and sobered people. Their 
taste of quiet, of personal and 
individual fulfillment, was a touch 
of paradise to them and they 
deeply resented its loss. 

Their return to material power 
was (in their minds) a descent 
and a degradation. Yet they had 
learned a lesson and learned it 
well. They made up their minds 
to defend themselves in such a 
way that never again — positive- 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ly, absolutely and forever — never 
again would they be attacked, 
no matter how long it might be, 
no matter how deep and distant- 
ly they buried their souls in their 
nameless, nebulous delights. 

So, after due consideration, 
they decided on the Barrier. They 
threw their total productivity — 
enormous, after their last war — 
and all their ingenuity into a de- 
fense to end all defenses. They 
marked out a segment of the sur- 
rounding space, purposely enclos- 
ing ten times the volume which 
their computers specified as the 
most that they could conceivably 
ever need for themselves. 

^T^HEY built a planetoid and 
stabilized it in an orbit around 
a dead sun not far from their 
cultural hub. This control planet- 
oid, in ways as yet far too ad- 
vanced for humanity to grasp, 
generated and maintained the 
Barrier itself. In addition, it gath- 
ered up cosmic debris and sucked 
it in and, with its mammoth au- 
tomatic machinery, transmuted 
and smelted and cast and ma- 
chined flight after flight of mis- 
siles — large and small. These 
were racked and stored by the 
hundreds of thousands, sta- 
tioned throughout the Barrier- 
protected space in a myriad of 
automatically computed orbits. 

And so it was that anything 
which penetrated the Barrier, 



from any quarter, was instantly 
hunted down and killed. 

There was some alarm at first 
over the fact that the Barrier, by 
its nature, must destroy anything 
leaving, as the missiles destroyed 
everything entering. But there 
seemed no valid answer to the 
question “Why not?” The Luanae 
weren’t going anywhere. They 
had space enough, and ten times 
space enough, for any roaming 
they chose to do. And they chose 
to do very little, for their orien- 
tation was back toward those 
golden years of introspection, of 
contemplative, inward self-reali- 
zation, and their hunger for it was 
very great. 

And so they locked the Uni- 
verse out and themselves in— 

And threw away the key. 

The control planetoid was a 
machine — automatic, self-repair- 
ing, powered by cold fusion of 
two isotopes of hydrogen, and it 
could always get hydrogen. It 
made missiles and used them. 
When it used them, it gathered 
up the dust that was left and sal- 
vaged it and made more. When 
any outbound matter was de- 
stroyed by the inner surface of 
the Barrier, it gathered up the 
radiant energy of the pyre, and 
the ashes, and brought them in 
and used them. It was impreg- 
nable, inexhaustible, tireless and 
immortal. It brought safety; it 
brought peace.

It brought death to a nomad 
people, so vastly superior in in- 
tellect and in what has been 
translated from the Luanae “send- 
ings” as “size-of-soul” that the 
Luanae, by that time steeped 
again in their unthinkable meta- 
physics, awoke to watch them ap- 
proach, awe-struck, alive and 
aware of them. What they were 
can never now be known. Even 
the Luanae do not know. They 
say only that their thirty thou- 
sand years of slavery to the crea- 
tures who invaded them was but 
a scratch, a toe-stub, compared to 
the wound they suffered in the 
realization that they caused the 
destruction of these nameless 
nomads. 

The creatures swept down on 
the Barrier, unable to detect 
something unique in the Universe, 
unwarned and unprepared, and 
were swallowed up by it. 

It is impossible to describe the 
impact of this event on the 
Luanae. Already deeply involved 
in their ancient philosophy, in 
tune with the Universe and re- 
specting all natural things — com- 
passionate, life-reverent, humble 
and kind — they watched the de- 
struction of their infinite superiors 
with an infinite horror. They 
realized then the extent of their 
folly, their crime in the creation 
of the Barrier. 

Already far gone again away 
from their technological peak. 



they again restored it. They sur- 
passed it. They mobilized to pull 
down what they had put up, 
driven by guilt and horror at the 
thing they had done. It was the 
crucifixion of crucifixions, the 
murder of murders with the Mes- 
siah of Messiahs their irreplace- 
able victim. 

A ND they failed. They had 
built too well. The planetoid 
destroyed everything that ap- 
proached it. It was surrounded 
by miniature versions of the great 
Barrier, some turned inside out 
so that the disintegrating surface 
was encountered first. It picked 
apart, in a microsecond, every- 
thing they threw at it, ate it, di- 
gested it, and was nourished. 

The Luanae then undertook a 
frightening sacrifice, an appalling 
expense. In an effort to overload 
the planetoid’s defenses, they 
flung up thousands of missiles, 
ships, lumps of rock and debris, 
hurling it every which way be- 
tween their stars and planets. Im- 
placably the planetoid located the 
intrusive matter, compared it 
with its matrix of stored infor- 
mation on allowable bodies and 
their permitted circlings, and 
sought out and destroyed the of- 
fending ones, quite uncaring that 
many of them, tragically many, 
were manned . 

And, in time, the Luanae dis- 
covered that the planetoid was 



20 



6AIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



producing missiles and energy 
past its original capacity, consum- 
ing more than it had originally 
been designed to handle, com- 
puting more things more quick- 
ly. At that, they ceased to attack 
it, realizing belatedly that they 
had forced it to enlarge and 
strengthen itself — the only course 
open to a self-repairing machine 
stressed beyond its original en- 
durance. 

They fell back then on the only 
thing left for them to do, as crea- 
tures of efficient conscience. They 
sent out warnings. 

They devised transmissions 
which covered the entire spectra 
of intelligence, transcending lan- 
guage, surpassing even symbol- 
ism. They set up automatic bea- 
cons to radiate the warning in 
all directions, each beam over- 
lapping the next. Bitterly, they 
organized a trade of monitors to 
watch over the automatic ma- 
chines, which they never again 
would trust. The monitors were 
ritualized like a priesthood, 
drilled like slave-legions, mari- 
nated in the impulses of duty. 

Once that was done and tested 
past any conceivable fault or 
failure, they settled to a new 
level of life, neither blindly me- 
chanical, like that which had pro- 
duced the planetoid, nor vegeta- 
tive and contemplative, like that 
which had left them open to 
slavery, but a middle ground, 

THE POD IN THE BARRIER 



based on the ancient convictions 
of respect for life and its ways 
in the rigid and marvelous frame 
of the Universe; and implemented 
it by an unrusting technology. 

So it was that the Luanae were 
at last in a position to make their 
greatest and most mature dis- 
covery — a thing known to each of 
them as individuals, but until 
now unrealized in terms of life- 
groups : 

A man cannot exist alone. He 
must be a member of something, 
a piece, an integer of some larger 
whole. Men plus men make cities, 
which band together to form 
states, then countries, then 
worlds, and never can a sole 
unit exist alone and unsupplied. 
Communication and intercourse 
are necessary and vital; without 
them, the lone unit is a brief ac- 
cident unnoticed by the Universe 
and forever forgotten. 

So, behind their gigantic ghast- 
ly barricade, the Luanae at last 
acknowledged membership in a 
grouping greater than species, 
and declared themselves belong- 
ing to Life and dedicated to the 
survival of its total membership. 

This, then, was the self-im- 
prisoned people discovered by an 
Earth scout ship, in the business 
of locating terrestrial planets for 
humanity. The Luanae rose with 
a shout at the sight of them. This 
was Life — life to aid and life 
to share. For until Earth came 

21 



to them, they saw themselves dy- 
ing like a surrounded city, like 
a lone traveler, like an amputated 
limb, like any other life separated 
from its sustaining body. 

Earth brought life to the 
Luanae, and the Luanae enlisted 
themselves in Earth’s search for 
life. 

A LOUSY trip. A suicide trip, 
with a skipper and utility 
monkey horse-blindered by their 
duties, three crackpots and an un- 
employed and unusable CG. And 
me. Palmer, with what could be 
the answer. 

I had faith in my solution; I 
liked its math. I had little or no 
hope that it would be tried — real- 
ly tried full-scale, and done right. 
People don’t know enough. They 
don’t think really straight. They 
turn the wrong valves and push 
the wrong buttons. Palmer should 
have a thousand hands and the 
ability to be simultaneously in a 
thousand places. Then this busi- 
ness of being the wasp-waist in 
the history of Life and the Lives 
of the two cultures — this would 
make more sense. 

I shall be bungled out of his- 
tory, I told myself as we ground 
along in the nothingness of sub- 
space — the Luanae subspace, 
given us by Luanae cold-fusion 
generators. I’m coming, I’m com- 
ing, I told the Luanae silently, 
but I bring the enemy; I bring 

22 



bungling; and, my marvels, you’ll 
succumb to stupidity as will I, 
for it’s the last and strongest 
enemy of them all, against which 
you and I might not prevail. 

I watched Potter picking away 
at his cuticles, and I silently bore 
Donato’s cough, and I gave my 
approval to big-eared England 
because he had so little to say to 
anybody; I tried to remember 
what exactly it was that made 
Nils Blum, the utility-monkey, 
funny to me when I saw him 
first; I hoped to recapture it and 
laugh again, but I never made it. 
I swore sometimes at Donato’s 
eternal helpfulness and I ignored 
the skipper, because who wants 
to talk all the screaming time 
about ship’s business and the 
business of ships gone by? 

... I said nothing where the 
CG could hear me, and tightened 
up in painful empathy when I 
saw one or another of the ship’s 
company floundering and defend- 
ing and doubting when she re- 
peated his words. 

I did nothing about any of 
these annoyances, except maybe 
the time I suggested to the skip- 
per that he feed the CG at times 
other than our mess, so I wouldn’t 
have to witness her purposeless 
wreckage of even the little things 
men believe in. He bought that, 
and it had a double advantage. 
We not only were spared the 
sight of her at meals, but she 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



took to spending her time aft in 
the “monkey’s cage” among the 
mops and drums of cleaning aero- 
sol and sewer-line scrapers. If Nils 
Blum objected, then, monkeylike, 
he could pass it off by scratch- 
ing and chewing a straw. 

... I came through there once 
and saw them sitting across from 
each other at Blum’s little table, 
elbows almost touching, not 
speaking and not looking at each 
other. And, by the Lord, she was 
crying, and I must say it did 
me good. I had a mind to go ask 
the monkey how he managed it, 
but I don’t involve myself with 
the unskilled. 

We got where we were going 
and snapped out of the nothing 
into the something. We took a 
bearing on the Luanae Galaxy 
and it was quite a sight, a long 
irregular sausage of an island 
galaxy, with its unmistakable 
signpost, the long regular black 
swatch of the Barrier’s edge 
where it impinged on, and shut 
out, the rest of the bodies in 
the formation. We ducked under 
again for half an hour and came 
up again too close to see the 
swatch, but close enough at last 
to get the Luanae greeting. 

That I can’t tell you about. 

C APTAIN Steev piped us all 
into the messhall in mid- 
morning, which would have an- 
noyed me if I could think of any- 

THE POD IN THE BARRIER 



thing I’d rather be doing — but 
there just wasn’t anything to do, 
or to want to do, instead. So I 
shuffled in with the rest of them 
— Potter, England, Donato. Blum 
and the CG were back with the 
mops, I imagine. The captain let 
us all be seated and stood at the 
end of the table and knocked on 
a coffee mug self-consciously. 

He said, “We have arrived at 
our site of operations. We have, 
among the four of you, four dif- 
ferent specialists with, as I under- 
stand it, four attacks on the prob- 
lem of penetrating the Luanae 
Barrier. I need not,” he says, and 
then went right on as if he needed 
to anyway, “need not tell you of 
the vital importance of this task. 
The entire history of humanity 
might — not might, does — depend 
On it. If you, or men like you, 
fail to solve this problem soon, 
we can expect our entire civili- 
zation to explode, like a dying 
sun, through the internal pres- 
sures of its own contracting mass.” 

He coughed to cover up the 
floridity of his phrasing, and little 
Donato happily joined in. I saw 
one of England’s wide flat hands 
move on the table, to cover the 
other and hold it down. 

“Now, then,” said the captain. 
He bent from the waist and re- 
moved his hand from his side 
pocket. In it was a sleek little re- 
mote mike. “This is for the record, 
gentlemen. You first, Mr. Palmer?” 

23 



“Me first what?” I wanted to 
know. 

“Your plan, sir. Your approach, 
attack, whatever it pleases you 
to call it. Your projected method 
of cracking the Barrier.” 

I looked around at what passed 
for an audience, coughing, pick- 
ing, glowering wetly. 

I said, “In the first place, my 
plan has been fully detailed and 
filed with the proper authorities — 
men who are in a position to un- 
derstand my specialty. I believe' 
that copies of these papers are on 
file with you. I suggest that you 
look at them and save us both the 
trouble.” 

“I’m afraid you don’t under- 
stand,” said the captain, looking 
flustered. He gestured at the 
mike. “This is for the record. I’ve 
got to have the oral rundown. 
It’s — it’s — well, for the record.” 

“Then I say to the recording, 
for the record,” I barked, right 
into the mike, “that I am not ac- 
customed to being asked to make 
speeches before a lay audience, 
which cannot be expected to un- 
derstand one word in ten of what 
I have to say. And I refer the 
recording and its auditors, who- 
ever they may be, to the files in 
which my detailed report is pre- 
sented, for proof not only of my 
project but of the fact that these 
assembled, and no doubt those 
listening to this record, would in 
all likelihood not know what I 



was talking about. Not at all.” 
I glared up at the skipper. 
“Does that satisfy the record. 
Lieutenant?” 

“Captain,” corrected the cap- 
tain mildly. “Really.” 

“A mistake,” I allowed. “I 
never make mistakes accidental- 
ly, you understand.” I waved at 
the mike. “Let’s let the record 
stand with that, do you mind?” 
“Mr. Potter,” said the captain, 
and I leaned back, pleased with 
myself. 

"P OTTER removed his finger 
and immediately replaced it. 
“Well I don’t bind tellig you 
bine,” he said adenoidally. “I’m in 
field bechanics, as you dough. I 
have bade certain calculations 
which indicate the the stresses 
present in the barrier skin are 
subject on bobentary distortion 
under the stress of shall area, 
high intenstidty focused bagnetic 
fields of about one hudred bil- 
lion gauss per square centimeter 
at focus. That’s billion,” he 
amended, “not billion.” 

I wondered how the record 
would make out the difference. 

“Very good, Mr. Potter,” said 
the captain. “Unless I am mis- 
taken, you propose to breach the 
Barrier momentarily with a high- 
intensity focused magnetic field. 
Is that correct?” 

Potter nodded, a gesture which 
carried through his right wrist. 



24 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Very well,” said the captain. 

I blew disgustedly through my 
nostrils, looking at Potter. His 
business was as disgusting as his 
hobby of picking at his cuticles. 
If I knew as little about my spe- 
cialty as he did about his, I’d 
never get trapped into talking 
about it. 

“Mr. Donato?” 

“Yes, Captain Steev, yes, sir!” 
Donato cried, all blushes and 
eagerness. “Well, sir. I’m in ballis- 
tics. What I propose is a two-part 
missile aimed to graze the Barrier 
in such a way that, at the mo- 
ment of contact, it separates, one 
segment glancing back outside, 
the other entering and proceeding 
inward. This is on the theory 
that, although the control planet- 
oid reacts instantaneously, its sen- 
sors report only one event at one 
locality at a given moment. I feel 
I have a fifty-fifty chance, then, 
of slipping one part through while 
the other part is being reported 
grazed and gone. I think a mini- 
mum of one hundred thirty shots, 
fired in four groups and at four 
slightly different approach angles, 
would establish whether or not 
the theory is tenable.” 

“Tenable?” I gasped. “Why, 
you — nincompoop!” That’s the 
first time in my entire life I ever 
called anyone that, but as I 
looked at him, blushing and grin- 
ning and wanting to do right, 
there just wasn’t another applic- 



able term. “What makes you 
think — ” 

“Mr. England?” said the skip- 
per, much louder than I have ever 
heard him speak before. 

I confess I was startled. Before 
I could quite recover myself, Eng- 
land answered. 

“In the area of mis,” he said 
in a whispery voice which at that 
point failed him. He swallowed 
with all his might and then made 
a weak, flickery smile. “In the 
field of missiles, my chief concern 
is, first, a series of tests to deter- 
mine the exact nature of the in- 
ternal control pulses in the hunt- 
ing missiles, the frequency and 
wave-height of the command 
pulses in the guided missiles, with 
a view to jamming or redirecting 
them. Second, I plan to lob some 
solids through the Barrier at low 
velocities in order to study the 
metallurgical content of the mis- 
siles, with a view to the design 
of sensing-dodging equipment, 
and possibly some type of repul- 
sion field, designed to force the 
missiles into a near miss.” 

“Very succinct,” said the cap- 
tain, and I wondered how he 
knew what was succinct or not 
about a specialty. “Now that 
we’ve got the swing of this little 
discussion, perhaps, Mr. Palmer, 
you would like to reconsider and 
join it.” 

“Perhaps I would at that,” I 
said, stopping to think it over. 



THE POD IN THE BARRIER 



25 



A FTER all, a little sense ought 
to be added to this exhibition 
of maundering incompetence, if 
only for balance. 

“Then if you must know,” I 
said, “the only tenable method of 
approaching the problem lies in 
the area of explosive stress. No 
one but myself seems to have no- 
ticed the almost perfectly spheri- 
cal shape of the Barrier. A sphere 
in any flexing material is a cer- 
tain indication of some dynamic 
tension, a container and the com 
tained in equilibrium, with the 
analog of some fluid differential 
like the air inside and outside an 
inflated balloon. You don’t follow 
me.” 

“Go on,” said the captain, hold- 
ing his head as if he was listening. 

“Why, all it will take is a 
toroidal mass equipped with a 
subspace generator and an alter- 
nator. If this is placed upon the 
Barrier margin and caused to 
vibrate into and out of the sub- 
space state, there will be a por- 
tion of the Barrier — that which is 
surrounded by the toroid — which 
will be included in the vibration. 
The effect then is in causing a 
circular section of the Barrier to 
be in nonexistence for part of the 
time. It is my conclusion that this 
small breach will cause the Bar- 
rier to collapse like that toy bal- 
loon I mentioned. Q. E. D. Lieu- 
tenant.” I leaned back. 

“Captain,” said the captain 



tiredly. Then he looked me in 
the eye and said, “I regret to in- 
form you, Mr. Palmer, that you 
are completely wrong. Blum!” he 
bellowed suddenly. “Coffee out 
here!” 

“Hah!” came the monke5r’s 
voice. It was as near as he ever 
let himself get to aye-aye, sir. 

He must have had the tray 
ready before the skipper called, 
because he came out with it 
loaded and steaming. He set it 
down in the middle of the table 
and retired to a corner. At the 
side of my eye, I saw the CG 
sidle out of the “cage” and go 
to stand silently beside him. 

But I wasn’t in a mood for any- 
thing but this preposterous alle- 
gation from the captain. I got to 
my feet so I could look down at 
him. 

“Did I understand you to say,” 
I ground out, cold as Neptune, 
“that in your opinion I am 
wrong?” 

“Quite wrong. The Barrier is 
a position, an infinite locus, not 
a material substance, and is there- 
fore not subject to the laws and 
treatments of matter per se.” 

I have been known to splutter 
when I am angry, unless I try 
not to. I found myself trying very 
hard not to. 

“I have reduced every observa- 
tion on that surface known to 
Man,” I informed him, “to mathe- 
matical symbology, and from it 



26 



GALAXY S C I E N C E F I C T I O N 



have written a consecutive se- 
quence of occasions which proves 
beyond doubt that the surface is 
as I say and will act as I say. 
You seem to forget that this is 
on the record, Admiral, and this 
may mean you are making a per- 
manent rather than a temporary 
fool of yourself.” 

I sat down, feeling better. 
“Captain,” ' said the captain 
wearily. 

TTE turned and took a paper 
from the stack of folders 
which I noticed for the first time 
lay there. He flashed it; at first 
glance, it looked like a page of 
figures over which a child super- 
imposed a crude and scratchy 
picture of a Christmas tree in red. 

He said, “Equation number 
132, four pi sigma over theta plus 
the square root of four pi sigma 
quantity squared.” I could not 
help noticing that, as he reeled it 
off, he was waving the paper, not 
reading from it. 

I said, “I recognize the equa- 
sion. Well?” 

“Well nothing,” snapped the 
captain. “Unwell, I’d call it. Heh.” 
He slid the sheet over to me. “If 
you will observe, to be consistent 
with the preceding series, the in- 
teger sigma is not whole but fac- 
toral, in view of which an in- 
creasing error is introduced 
wherein — but see for yourself.” 

I looked. What resembled a 

THE POD IN THE BARRIER 



crude picture of a Christmas tree 
was the correction, in red, of the 
symbol he had mentioned, and 
the scrawled figures of three cor- 
rected factors in the next equa- 
tion and seven in the third fol- 
lowing, until the red marks be- 
came a whole line. 

I said, “Might I ask who has 
had the effrontery to scribble all 
over these calculations?” 

“Oh, I did,” said the captain. 
“I thought it might be a good idea 
to rework the whole series, just 
in case, and I’m glad I did. You 
ought to be, too.” 

I looked again at the sheet and 
swallowed sand. A man has to 
major for a considerable time in 
some highly creative math to 
be able to do what had been 
done here. A thing or two came 
to my lips, but I would not say 
them, because they were for my 
figures and against his, yet it 
could not be denied that his were 
right. 

To save something out of this, 
I growled at him, “I think, sir, 
you owe me an explanation as to 
why you have chosen publicly to 
humiliate me.” 

“I didn’t humiliate you. Those 
figures humiliated you, and 
they’re your figures,” he said, and 
shrugged. 

I glanced at Potter and Eng- 
land. They were grinning broad- 
ly. I looked up suddenly and 
caught the CG’s flat gray stare. 

27 



“They’re your figures,” she 
murmured, and anyone hearing 
her would swear she knew for 
certain that I had copied them 
from somebody else’s work. There 
was such a flame of insistence 
burning up in me that they were 
so my figures that I could barely 
contain it. But contain it I did; 
they were not figures I was 
anxious to claim at the moment. 

I was very confused. I slumped 
down in my chair. 

iiV^OU’RE next, Mr. Potter. 

I’m sorry to have to in- 
form you that although, in theory, 
the Barrier does yield under the 
stress of a magnetic field such as 
you describe, it would take a 
generator somewhat larger than 
this ship to supply it; the affected 
area would be just about what 
you said — a square centimeter; 
and, finally, it wouldn’t be a hole 
in the Barrier, but what you 
might call a replacement patch. 
In other words, the affected area 
will, when surrounded by the so- 
called Barrier skin, act precisely 
like part of that skin in all re- 
spects.” 

Potter put his hobby finger out 
for inspection and was so dis- 
tressed he forgot to look at it. 
“Are . are you sUre?” 

“That’s what happened the last 
seven times it was tried.” 

Potter made a wordless sound, 
a sort of moan, or sigh. I did not 

28 



feel like grinning at him as he 
had at me. England did not grin, 
either, because I think he realized 
what was coming. He just sat 
there wondering how it would 
come. 

It came at Donato first. “Mr. 
Donato — ” 

“Yes, sir, Cap’n.” 

“You propose a two-piece mis- 
sile. You seem to forget, as many 
another has before you, that the 
Barrier offers no resistance to 
penetration and therefore needs 
no complicated hanky-panky to 
get something inside. In addi- 
tion, it’s unimportant whether or 
not an object is sensed by the 
skin and reported to control, or 
whether it’s picked up a minute 
or hour later by one of the hunt- 
ing missiles. You’ve attacked the 
whole problem with a view to 
getting something inside, which 
isn’t a problem, and overlooked 
what to do inside, which is.” 

“Oh, Cap’n, I’m sorry,” said 
Donato, stricken. He burst into 
a sharp series of barking coughs. 
There were tears in his eyes. “Oh, 
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.” 

“Nothing to be sorry about,” 
the captain said. “Got it yet, Mr. 
England?” 

“Whuh? Oh,” said the missile 
expert. “I guess I was off base 
about the jamming. Suddenly it 
seems to me that’s so obvious, it 
must have been tried and it 
doesn’t work.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Right, it doesn’t. That’s be- 
cause the frequency and ampli- 
tude of the control pulses make 
like purest noise — the5^re genu- 
inely random. So trying to jam 
them is like trying to jam FM 
with an AM signal. You hit it so 
seldom, you might as well not 
try.” 

“What do you mean, random? 
You can’t control anything with 
random noise.” 

The captain thumbed over his 
shoulder at the Luanae Galaxy. 
“They can. There’s a synchronous 
generator in the missiles that 
reproduces the same random 
noise, peak by pulse. Once you do 
that, modulation’s no problem. I 
don’t know how they do it. They 
just do. The Luanae can’t explain 
it; the planetoid developed it.” 

England put his head down al- 
most to the table. “The same ran- 
dom,” he whispered from the very 
edge of sanity. 

A S if anxious to push him 
the rest of the way, the cap- 
tain said cheerfully, “Good think- 
ing on that proposal to study the 
metal content of the missiles. 
Only there isn’t any. They’re a 
hundred per cent dielectric syn- 
thetics— God knows exactly what. 
The planetoid can trasmute, you 
know. What little circuitry the 
missiles have is laid out in fluid- 
filled pipes, capillary coils, things 
like that. There seems to be some 

THE POD IN THE BARRIER 



sort of instantaneous transition 
from solid to liquid and back. The 
liquid conductors are solid dielec- 
trics again just as soon as they 
have passed whatever current 
they’re supposed to pass, and 
that’s done in microseconds.” 
“Radar-transparent,” concluded 
England dolefully. 

“For all practical purposes,” 
agreed the captain. “Well, that 
seems to be that, gentlemen.” 
“Just you tell me one thing,” 
I said before I could stop myself. 
“Precisely what in hell are we 
doing here at all?” 

“Precisely what you came to 
do.” The captain picked up his 
folders. “Blum, I sense that these 
four gentlemen might be happier 
without an audience, even us.” 
“Come on, Virginia.” 

The captain started out for- 
ward and the monkey and the CG 
headed aft. We all sat where we 
were. 

After a time, England said, 
“Why didn’t he tell me he knew 
so much about missiles?” 

“Did you ask him?” snapped 
Potter. 

That was the question and an- 
swer I had been humbly formu- 
lating, too. I said, “What did he 
mean, we are here to do what 
we came to do?” 

“Maybe he wants us to get 
oriented, is all,” said Donato 
sheepishly. “Get off theory, you 
know. Like field work.” 

29 



“If he thinks he’s jolting my 
inspiration, he’s crazy,” gloomed 
England. He wiped his wet eyes 
with the backs of his hands, leav- 
ing them still wet. “The jolt, I 
got all right. The inspiration, I 
can’t find.” 

“He should have told us be- 
fore, right at the start. Maybe by 
now we’d have a whole new set 
of figures.” Donato caught my 
sharp look and immediately said, 
“Theories, I mean, friend. I didn’t 
mean to say figures.” 

Somehow that didn’t help. 

“Get out of here, Donato,” I 
said. 

“Sure, friend, sure,” he said 
and got out like always, smiling. 
He went into his room and closed 
the door. We could hear him 
coughing. 

“Like a box you have in your 
room ten years,” Potter was mut- 
tering adenoidally, “it all of a 
sudden goes boing and there’s a 
jumpid-jack.” I was going to ask 
him what he was talking about 
and then realized he was talking 
about the captain. I saw his point. 
Why hadn’t he called this meet- 
ing weeks ago? 

“He must like things to look 
futile,” I said. “I’m going back to 
bed.” 

“Be, too,” said Potter. 

I got up. Potter and England 
stayed where they were. They 
were going to talk about me. 

I just didn’t care. 



T DREAMED I was walking in 
-*• a meadow, smelling the sweet 
fresh odor of snowdrops, when all 
of a sudden they grew taller and 
taller, or I grew smaller and 
smaller, and I saw that instead of 
stems, the snowdrops were grow- 
ing on a sequence of equations. I 
began to read them off, but they 
got all twisted and jumbled and 
started to grab at my feet. I fell 
and grunted and caught hard at 
the edges of the bunk and was 
totally awake. 

I turned over and looked at the 
overhead. I felt clear-headed but 
lethargic. I thought I could still 
smell the snowdrops. 

Then I noticed the whine. It 
was far away, but persistent. The 
lights looked funny. They seemed 
to be flickering slightly, but when 
you looked straight at them, they 
were steady. I didn’t like it. It 
made me feel dizzy. 

I got up and went out into the 
corridor. Nobody was around. 
Then a timid voice said behind 
me, “Virginia in there?” 

I jumped and turned. It was 
the monkey, cringing against the 
bulkhead. 

“You think I’m that bad off?” 
I answered him in disgust, but 
as I turned away, he leaned for- 
ward and peered into my room 
anyway. 

I went into the messhall and 
knocked on the decanter and, 
when it steamed, poured coffee. 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Somewhere in the background, I 
heard a wistful murmur, and then 
Potter’s shocked voice: “In here? 
Monkey, didn’t they tell you? I 
like girls.” In a moment, he came 
shuffling in and headed for the 
coffee. “What time is it. Palmer?” 

I shrugged. I looked at the 
clock, but it didn’t seem to make 
any sense to me. 

“God,” said Potter, and sniffed 
noisily. “I feel all . discon- 
nected. I got a buzzing in my 
ears. My eyes — it’s sort of flick- 
ery.” 

I looked at him curiously, won- 
dering what it must be like to 
be a man who so readily relates 
everything around him to himself. 
“That isn’t your flicker. It’s ours. 
Same with the buzz, though I’d 
call it a sort of whine.” 

He looked very relieved. “You 
hear it, too. What happens here, 
anyway?” 

I drank some coffee and looked 
at the clock again. “What’s the 
matter with that clock?” I de- 
manded. 

Potter craned to look at it. 
“Can’t be. Can’t be.” 

Donato came in, his face 
scrubbed and shining. “Morning, 
Palmer. Potter. Well, I wondered 
which one of us would fall first, 
and I guess I know now, and 
who’d a’ thunk it.” He nodded aft 
and began coughing. 

We looked. The monkey was 
stepping off one foot and onto 

THE POD IN THE BARRIER 



the other in front of England’s 
door. 

“You ought to mind your own 
business, Don.” 

“Oh, sure,” said Donato agree- 
ably. “Guess you’re right at that.” 

Just then, England flung his 
door open, saw Nils Blum crouch- 
ing there, and recoiled with an 
odd high squeak. 

Immediately he growled, in his 
deepest bass, “Don’t hang around 
me, monk,” and pushed past the 
utility man without a backward 
glance. 

Vj^E watched, looking past him 
** as he approached. Blum 
ducked his head inside England’s 
door, withdrew it, took a step 
toward us and stopped, his jaw 
working silently, his big wrinkled 
head held a little askew. 

“But hungry, I’m hungry,” Eng- 
land said. “Whatever time is it?” 

“Clock’s busted.” Potter sud- 
denly laughed. We all looked at 
him. “Well,” he said, pointing at 
England, “it’s not him, either.” 

“You were just saying to Don, 
he ought to mind his own busi- 
ness,” I snapped. I wonder, I 
thought to myself, if he knows I 
cut at him because he picks his 
cuticles? 

“What business? What goes?” 
England demanded. 

“By holy creepin’ Kramden,” 
said Donato to himself. He 
looked aft at the miserable figure 

31 



there and forward at the closed 
door to the wardroom and con- 
trol. “What do you know.” 

“He is a very surprising man,” 
I said. 

“Who? Who? The skipper? 
What’s he done now?” England 
insisted. 

“Virginia seems to be missing,” 
said Donato. 

Hearing her name, Blum ran 
three steps toward us and then 
stopped in the messhall' door, 
looking timidly at our faces, one 
by one. 

“Well,” said Potter, “rank has 
its privileges.” 

England blew sharply through 
his nostrils, expressing a great 
deal and disposing of the matter. 
He glanced at the clock. “What’d 
you say is wrong with it?” 

“Nothing’s wrong with it.” 

We turned abruptly and faced 
the captain. There was an odd- 
ness about him, a set to his jaw, 
a certain hard something in his 
eye that hadn’t been there at 
all before. Or maybe it had, there 
at the table this morning. (Was 
that this morning? What the 
clock said just made no sense at 
all.) I looked at the captain and 
past him, through his open door, 
through the wardroom with his 
neat bunk at the side, on for- 
ward to the control console and 
observation blister. 

There wasn’t anybody up there. 

From the other doorway, the 



utility monkey whispered, 
“Sir . ?” 

“Something the matter with the 
lights. Captain,” Donato said. 

“It’s all right,” said the captain 
shortly. He went to the messhafl 
peeper and switched it on. He 
dialed for starboard view and 
stepped back. 

We crowded around it. Every- 
thing looked about the same out 
there, the wide vein of jewels 
straggling across the sky, then 
the unrelieved black. 

“Show you something,” said 
the captain. He moved the con- 
trols and the view zoomed in 
toward the stars. At close to peak 
magnification, he switched to the 
fine tuning and got the cross- 
hairs where he wanted them. 
“Know what that is?” 

TT was a ball, shiny, golden. It 
■*- was impossible to say how big. 
Then I heard England gasp. 

“I’ve seen that before. Pictures. 
That’s the Barrier Control — the 
planetoid!” 

“So close?” I asked. 

“Just because the Barrier is a 
sphere,” said the captain, “every- 
one assumes the control has to 
be in the center. Well, it isn’t. 
It’s right here at the edge, and 
heaven help anything that goes 
in there in a rush, trying to con- 
verge on the center!” 

“Sir . .” came the whisF>er. 

“Now look,” said the captain. 



32

winding the zoom handle again. 
The view backed away from the 
golden sphere until it was almost 
lost. Suddenly the screen filled 
with a flat- topped, streamlined — 
“A pod, a ship’s pod!” said Eng- 
land. 

The captain stepped back a 
pace and watched the pod with 
glowing eyes. His hands were 
pressed tight together and some 
great suppressed excitement 
yearned in him to burst free. We 
looked from him to the peeeper. 

Under his breath, the captain 
said, “Git’m! Go git’m!” 

“Sir . .” 

“Shut up, monk.” 

“That pod’s inside the Barrier!” 
somebody said. Me, I think. 
“Look! Look there!” 

It was like a segment of ivory 
knitting needle. It was turning 
slowly end over end. It ap- 
proached the pod slowly, high, 
passed close by and drifted out 
of the picture. 

“A missile, a big one.” 

“My God, what’s happened?” 
gasped Donato. 

“The Barrier’s down,” said the 
captain, as if he couldn’t hold 
the words inside any longer. “It’s 
down, you see? It’s gone and the 
missiles are all dead.” 

“Sir, oh, Cap’n ... I can’t 
find Virginia. Where’s Virginia, 
Cap’n?” 

“You’re looking at her, Blum. 
You’re looking right at her,” said 



the captain, his eyes fixed on the 
screen. 

Something hit us, scattered us. 
For a moment, the messhall was 
a swirl of grunts and outraged 
yells, and then the utility monkey 
had tumbled us aside and was 
standing in front of the peeper, 
one hand on each side frame. He 
seemed a half a head taller, all 
at once, and his one hairy arm, 
where it passed close by me, had 
cords on it I hadn’t known about 
before; his head was a lion’s head. 

Suddenly he barked, “Whafd 
you do? What’d you do?” He was 
talking to the captain, who kept 
looking over Blum’s shoulder at 
the picture and was laughing 
softly. Then the monkey whirled 
from the screen, turning as if to 
turn was to tear something, and 
he faced the captain and said 
again, “What’d you do? What’d 
you do with Virginia?” 

^^HE captain stopped laughing 
altogether and was a cap- 
tain duty-talking to a utility mon- 
key. “I gave her her orders and 
I put her in that pod and sent 
her on her way. Any objections, 
mister?” 

Blum’s eyes began to protrude 
— honestly, you could see them 
press outward. His mouth opened 
slowly, slowly, and a dribble sud- 
denly scored the corner of the 
mouth and down the side of the 
chin; the hands came up, clawed, 



34 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



half-grasping. The nostrils trem- 
bled, trembled . and then he 
screamed, so loud, so close to us, 
it was like a big dazzling light 
flashing to blind us. 

We reared back from that 
scream, pawing at it. 

Next thing was Blum, crouched 
over and peering ahead as he ran, 
trying to go somewhere, not 
knowing how. He ran crazily to 
the airlock hatch and hit it with 
his fists, and turned with his back 
to it and screamed again. “You 
send me, you hear? You send me 
with Virginia, you hear me, 
Cap’n?” 

Donato strolled over toward 
him and, smiling, said the stu- 
pidest thing I ever heard squirted 
into a violent silence: “Aw, come 
on, monkey, let’s all be chums.” 
Blum screamed again and Do- 
nato didn’t wait to get turned 
around. He ran straight backward 
until he hit me, and I caught him 
and held him up so he didn’t 
fall. 

“Captain, sir,” Donato said, 
squinching his head around as 
he dangled from my hands, “he 
won’t mind me at all. Captain.” 
“Get to your quarters, Blum,” 
said the captain from way back 
in his throat. 

“You bring her back or you 
send me out with her, one,” slav- 
ered Blum. “You hear me?” 

“Get — to — your — quarters.” 
Blum put up his claws. He be-

gan walking toward the captain, 
chewing on his own mouth-parts, 
and his eyes were crazy. The cap- 
tain bent a little low and put his 
arms out a little from his sides, 
and moved very slowly toward 
Blum. We all got back out of the 
way. 

Blum said, “Now! You hear 
me?” very softly, and leaped. 

The captain stepped aside and 
hit him. I thought it was on the 
head, but England told me later 
it was on the side of the neck, 
toward the back. The monkey 
was in midair when the captain 
hit him, and he went right down 
on the deck on his face, and he 
didn’t put out his hands to stop 
himself, and he didn’t move. 

We all looked at him and then 
at each other. 

“Take him to his quarters,” 
said the captain. 

His voice startled me because 
it wasn’t where I thought it was, 
standing by the sprawled-out 
monkey. He was already across 
the room staring into the peeper. 
For him, the thing was finished; 
probably his heart wasn’t quick 
any more. He was back with his 
work, his job. The rest of us 
had poundings in the side of our 
necks and we didn’t know what 
to do. 

“Go on, go on. Get him out of 
here. You, Palmer. You’re the 
biggest.” 

I was going to splutter, but I 

35 



held on tight to it and didn’t. I 
said, “See here, I don’t have to—” 

T7ROM back in his throat, like 
before, the captain spoke to 
me. It was a different thing, be- 
ing the one he spoke to like that 
and not watching somebody else 
get it. 

He said, “You see here — you 
do have to. Whatever I say, you 
have to, not only you. Palmer, 
but all four of you clowns. The' 
party’s over and the work’s done, 
and from now on out, you mind 
me and think first of what I 
want. At all times. Is that clear, 
mister?” 

I said, loud, “Well, I-” and 
the skipper ripped his eyes away 
from the sceen, almost like 
Blum, tearing something, and 
looked at me. So I picked up the 
monkey’s shoulders and dragged 
him back to his cabin. 

It was just like ours, only he 
didn’t have quite so much stuff 
lying around, or anyway what 
there was was in square stacks. 

I tumbled him into the bunk 
and closed the door, because that 
was the only clear place to lean 
back against, and I leaned on it 
and tried to get my breath back. 

The monkey started to make 
a scratchy sound in the rear of 
his throat. I looked down at him. 
His head was twisted to one side. 
It was jammed against the pil- 
low. His eyes were open. 

36 



“Cut that out, monk.” He went 
right on doing it. “That noise, 
cut it out, hear me? I said, you 
hear me, mister?” 

That “mister” didn’t sound a 
bit like the skipper’s. I was em- 
barrassed. 

The monkey’s eyes stayed open 
and I realized he wasn’t blink- 
ing them; he wasn’t seeing out 
of them. I couldn’t stand that 
breathing noise, so finally I 
straightened out his head and put 
the pillow under it. He stopped 
the noise right away. He closed 
his eyes. 

I still couldn’t get my breath. 
He had blood on his face; maybe 
that was it. 

He didn’t open his eyes, but 
he began to talk, very fast, very 
soft. It was like being too far 
away from someone to under- 
stand what was being said, and 
then it was like coming closer . 

“. all she had to do was let 
herself and she couldn’t do it, 
she couldn’t just stop fighting and 
believe. It was like she’d die if 
she believed anything. She 
wanted to. More than anything 
she wanted to. But it was like 
someone told her, if you believe 
in anything, you’ll die.” 

He opened his eyes suddenly 
and saw me and closed them 
again. 

“Palmer. You Palmer you, you 
saw it your own self, the time she 
cried. All that time, all those 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



weeks, those gray eyes still and 
hiding whatever it was she had 
inside her, and me begging her 
and begging: ‘Virginia, oh, Vir- 
ginia, I don’t care what you think 
of me, I wouldn’t want you to 
love me, Virginia. But only be- 
lieve me; you can so be loved, 
you’re worth loving, I love you. 
I do, Virginia; just you believe 
that once, because it’s true, and 
after that you’ll be able to be- 
lieve other things . little ones 
at first; I’ll help you with them, 
and always tell you the truth.’ 

“I said, ‘Don’t love me, Vir- 
ginia, or think about it at all. I 
wouldn’t know what to do with it 
if you gave me anything like 
that.’ I said, ‘Just trust me is all 
I want, so you can ask me what’s 
the truth and I’ll tell you. But 
believe I love you; I’m not much, 
Virginia, so I guess that’s not too 
much to start on. Believe I love 
you, Virginia, will you just do 
that?’ And she . 

TTE lay with his eyes open for 
a long time and I thought 
he was unconscious again, but 
then he blinked his eyes and 
went on. 

“. she cried, all at once, all 
over, and she said, ‘Monkey, mon- 
key, you’re tearing me up, can’t 
you see? I want to believe you. I 
want to believe you more than 
anything in the world. But I can’t, 
I don’t know how, Fm not sup- 

THE POD IN THE BARRIER 



posed to, I’m not allowed.’ That’s 
what she said. And she cried 
again and said, ‘But I want to 
believe you, monkey. You just 
don’t know how much I want to 
believe that. Only . nothing is 
what it looks like, nothing is 
what it’s supposed to be, no one 
really wants, what they say they 
want. I can’t believe them and I 
can’t believe you.’ 

“She said, ‘Suppose I believed 
you and then the day came when 
things were all straight and true, 
and they let you see everything; 
and suppose I found out then that 
everything you said wasn’t so; 
found out maybe there was no 
you at all, monkey . what about 
that? I couldn’t stand that. I 
don’t dare believe you, because 
I want to. If I don’t believe any- 
thing about anything or anyone, 
then if things get all true, I can 
start there and be all right with- 
out losing anything.’ And she 
cried some more and then, you. 
Palmer, you came in, and in a 
second she was back inside her 
flat gray eyes. So she didn’t be- 
lieve me and that’s why.” 

I couldn’t get my breath. Blum 
couldn’t get his breath. I leaned 
on the door and he lay on the 
bed and we panted. 

“There was a difference,” he 
whispered, chasing some thought 
he was having. “She had a way 
of making you doubt anything 
you said. I told her my mother 

37 



could cook. She said, ‘Your 
mother could cook’ in that flat 
way, and you know, I had to 
think and wonder if my mother 
really could. That’s what I mean. 
But I said to her, ‘Virginia, you 
know, I love you,’ and she said, 
‘You love me’ in that same way, 
like who ever heard of such a 
thing? 

“But what I’m trying to say, 
that didn’t touch me, when she 
did that when I said I love you. 
I looked into how I felt and I 
felt the same no matter what she 
said. So about that, there was a 
difference. That’s how it was all 
right to say, ‘Believe me, believe 
me about that.’ I knew that 
things could change. I knew that 
almost anything I told her could 
be wrong, some way. But not that. 
She could trust me with that. 
And she wanted to. At least I 
got that.” 

I leaned aganist the door, feel- 
ing embarrassed, and then I could 
turn it to anger. 

I said, “You’re stupid, monkey, 
you know? You’re crew, she’s CG. 
She couldn’t stop you. Why didn’t 
you just go right ahead? That’s 
what she’s aboard for.” 

UT that didn’t make him 
” angry. He looked up at the 
ceiling and said quietly, “Yeah, 
she said that, too. She said, ‘You 
don’t know what you want, mon- 
key,’ she said. She said, ‘This is 



what you want. So go ahead, only 
stop talking about it.’ I said no. I 
said there could be a time — I 
hadn’t thought about it yet; 
I wanted something else first — I 
wanted her to believe me. She 
said I was crazy and to keep 
away from her then, but after, 
you saw it. Palmer. After, she said 
she wanted to believe me, more 
than anything.” 

He was quiet at last, breathing 
easily, thinking about something 
to smile at. I spoke to him, but 
he didn’t answer. He was asleep, 
I guess. I opened the door quiet- 
ly and closed it on him and went 
back to the messhall. 

They were all there by the 
peeper, watching. 

I said, “He’s asleep now, but 
there’s going to be particular hell 
to pay when he wakes up and 
really understands she isn’t here.” 
The skipper looked away from 
the screen at me and then back 
again. He wouldn’t spit on the 
messhall deck, but he might as 
well, the way his face looked. 
He couldn’t worry about that 
monkey. 

I asked Potter, “What goes?” 
Potter said, “Whether to get 
mad or glad, I don’t know. You 
specialist. Palmer— you’re a clown. 
And England. Donato. Me, too. 
Virginia, she was the specialist 
all along. She was the one this 
whole thing is for. How much 
farther?” he called out. 



38 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“A few meters,” said Donato, 
absorbed. 

I looked at the peeper. The 
ship’s pod, that long false under- 
belly we’d hauled all the way 
from the Earth Worlds, it was 
drifting in close to that golden 
ball. That ball, I could see now, 
it was big as a supership if you 
could roll a supership into a ball. 
It was big as some moons. There 
were pale sticks drifting all over, 
dozens of them. 

“Dead missiles, you see?” said 
Potter, watching the screen. “All 
dead. Every single cold-fusion 
power plant and explosive in a 
thousand kilometers is dead. 
Maybe more. Ours, too.” 

“Ours?” 

“That hum, that flicker. We’re 
not tapping a cold-fusion plant 
now. Palmer. We’re taking off a 
steam turbine, water superheated 
by a parabolic mirror from that 
sun yonder.” 

“Steam turbine take us home?” 

“Stupid!” 

Donato chimed in. It was 
weird. Everybody talking whis- 
pery, as if loud noises would spoil 
something in the peeper. Nobody 
looked at anybody to talk, just 
kept watching the peeper, some 
of them moving the mouth all to 
one side to talk to one, to the 
other side to talk to someone else. 

Donato said, “Little turbine 
wouldn’t move this can half a 
length.” 

THE POD IN THE BARRIER 



“It’s all right,” England said. 
“What she’s doing, she’s going in 
there to leech on to that planet- 
oid. First there’s a catalyst that 
will crumble a pit in the armor, 
because a bomb’ll hardly scratch 
it. Then, when the skin’s thin 
enough, she’s got a bomb there. 
It goes off and no more Barrier.” 

“He said the Barrier’s gone.” 

“Sure. She damped it. She’s 
holding it dead. If she let go, 
bango, back comes the Barrier 
and all those missiles come to 
life.” 

“What’s this damped, holding 
it dead, letting go — what is all 
this?” I was getting impatient. 

HE skipper saw fit to say 
something. “We call it the D- 
field because — ” he was quiet a 
long time — “because that way it 
sounds like something we know 
about, can know about.” 

He flicked a quick glance at 
all of us, as if somebody was go- 
ing to laugh. Nobody was going 
to laugh. 

“What it is,” said the skipper, 
hating to say it, “it’s doubt. A field 
of doubt. I mean — well, doubt, 
that’s all.” 

Nobody said anything. Doubt, 
all right. But doubt has a way of 
getting invisible after a captain 
makes all those loud captain 
noises like he did. 

I imagine he knew that. None 
of it was our business, not any 

39 



more, but he didn’t want to be 
doubted, not even by us special- 
ists— us clowns. 

He said, “What we did, we 
found Virginia trying to commit 
suicide. She had this doubt thing 
on her back, naturally. She didn’t 
want to go on, because she had 
nothing she could believe in. Or 
just plain believe. Well, we took 
her and gave her some treat- 
ments . I’m a skipper, I don’t 
know the details . Anyway, 
she came out of it with what she 
had when she went in, but more 
so. Much more. You all felt it — 
don’t tell me you didn’t. She 
could make a man doubt his own 
name.” 

I said, “Yeah . .” only realiz- 
ing when I heard it that I’d said 
it aloud. 

Captain Steev watched the 
screen for a while and said under 
his breath, “That’s right . atta 
girl . .” and then to us, “It was 
a tricky problem. Given that a 
concentrated disbelief in things 
could have an effect like this — 
just for the sake of argument — 
if you want someone to stop a 
big power plant from a great dis- 
tance with this faculty, how do 
you transport that someone in a 
ship powered with the same type 
of plant?” 

“If it was a machine now,” said 
England, “I’d say assemble it only 
when you wanted to use it.” 

“That’s the way they did with 



the first fission bombs,” said Do- 
nato knowledgably. “They didn’t 
put it together until it was due 
to blow. They blew it by putting 
it together. But doing that with a 
person, now . .” 

“You have the idea. You can’t 
disbelieve in anything until you 
know what it is, or at least what 
people think it is. I can’t believe 
or disbelieve that pyoop is the 
word for godmother in High Mar- 
tian. I just don’t know. Well, Vir- 
ginia didn’t know one way or 
another about a cold-fusion plant, 
though I swear ours gasped a 
time or two on the way out. She 
has a large amount of control 
over it.” 

"P' NGLAND said with sudden 
impatience, “Excuse me. Cap- 
tain, but the only reason I can 
stand here talking about this is 
I see it working.” 

“Let me tell you, then. The 
cold-fusion plant is a Luanae 
idea. It’s real simple-minded. 
Anybody can understand it once 
it’s explained to them. Everything 
was set up when we came out 
here, including you four. The 
crackpot experts who knew more 
than people who’ve been in this 
all their lives. But as far as she 
was concerned, you were experts 
right up to the time I set you up 
and knocked you down— factorial 
sigma and the square-centimeter 
magnetic field, hah!

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“She doubted you were experts 
when she first saw you, just be- 
cause she doubted everything. 
When she saw what I did to you, 
she felt she was right to doubt. 
She reached a . sort of peak 
of disbelief. My God, didn’t you 
feel it? . Look there, she’s 
leeched down. Now the catalyst 
will be working on the armor. 
It won’t be long now.” 

“I still don’t see how just plain 
disbelief can shut down power 
plants,” I argued. 

“Not power plants. Just cold- 
fusion plants. Well, let me tell 
you and you’ll understand. I put 
a shot of sleep-gas in your ven- 
tilators and got you all out of 
the way. Then — ” 

66 ^ NOWDROPS,” I said, re- 
mernbering. 

“Then I put her in the pod and 
told her to ride it, that’s all. Ex- 
cept I . armed her . like you 
arm a bomb, you see? I told her 
what a cold-fusion plant is. She 
didn’t care one way or the other, 
mind, but she listened while I 
explained it to her, all the parts. 
Then I gave her a paper and told 
her this is exactly what happens. 
I told her to read it as soon as 
the red light on the panel went 
on, which would be when she 
was clear of the ship.” 

“Read what?” somebody asked, 
after it got too quiet. 

It was a long wait, watching 



that pod leeched to the planetoid 
and nothing happening but white 
sticks drifting, rocks, bits of stuff 
the planetoid had pulled in and 
hadn’t been able to eat ... 

“Read what?” the captain fi- 
nally repeated. “The cold-fusion 
formula, that’s all. Written out 
in words of one cylinder. When 
Hydrogen One and Hydrogen 
Two are in the presence of mu 
mesons, they fuse into Helium 
Three with an energy yield in 
electron volts of 5.4 times ten to 
the fifth power. That’s what was 
on the paper. She knew, piece 
by each, what the parts were — 
what mu mesons and Helium 
Three are and what is meant by 
that many electron volts. She 
had all that buried deep in her 
before we left the Earth Worlds. 
She’d had no occasion to put 
them together, that’s all. 

“And here I come saying (on 
paper), ‘This gadget does exact- 
ly such and such.’ Well, she just 
out and out doesn’t believe it. 
That would make no never mind 
to a turbine or a power drill, but 
when you get into subatomic 
particles, clouds of them, involved 
in a catalysis — untouched in the 
long run, but I imagine pretty 
edgy . and you slam them 
with this thing, whatever it is 
she has ...” 

Suddenly impatient, he rapped, 
“Who am I trying to convince? 
It works, you see?” 



THE POD IN THE BARRIER

1 SAID, “Get off my foot, 
monk,” and went on watching 
the screen. I don’t think anyone 
else noticed the utility man. I 
hardly did myself. 

“Hey,” Donato said suddenly, 
“our generators are out, right? 
How do we get out of here?” 
“When the bomb blows — no 
more D-field. Simple.” 

England barked, just as sud- 
denly, “And what about all those 
missiles with the damper gone? 
They shoot off in every — ” 

“Dry up, clown,” said the skip- 
per. “And keep your panic to 
yourself. Every one of those mis- 
siles is triggered from one place 
and one place only — that planet- 
oid. How do you think they were 
kept inside the Barrier and off 
the Luanae Earths all this time? 
Who cares if they get their power 
and explosives again? There’ll 
be nobody in the driver’s seat 
any more. Now shut up. It ought 
to blow pretty quick.” 

“Blow how? If it’s right in the 
middle of the — uh — damping 
field-” 

“I said shut up! That isn’t a 
cold-fusion bomb. It’s a hairy old 
thermonuclear that doesn’t give 
a damn what anybody believes.” 
“What is it? What’s going 
to happen? Whafs out there? 
Where - ” 

“Go on back to bed, monk,” I 
said out of the side of my mouth, 
watching the screen. I meant it

to sound kind — he’d had a bad 
time — but it didn’t come out 
kind. I guess I’ll never get used 
to talking to them. 

It let go. 

Oh, my God. 

Captain Steev was wrong. 
There was triggering, somewhere, 
in some part of that split-second 
of hell. Because all the missiles 
went, too. They didn’t fly; they 
didn’t hunt. The warheads went. 

It took a long time for our 
eyes to come back. The peeper 
screen was gone for good. 

The turbine moaned down and 
down the scale and stopped. The 
lights stopped that annoying side- 
of-the-eye flicker. 

“We got to go out and get Vir- 
ginia,” was the first complete sen- 
tence anyone said. 

Somebody laughed. Not a fun- 
ny laugh. 

England’s voice was harsh. 
“Don’t be stupider’n you have 
to be, monkey. Don’t you see 
we’re back on our cold-fusion 
plant?” 

“That makes no difference to 
him,” I told England. “He wasn’t 
around when the skipper ex- 
plained.” 

“Who wasn’t around?” barked 
the captain. “Damm it, Blum, no- 
body told you to leave your 
quarters. You’re confined, you un- 
derstand that? You, Palmer, can’t 
I trust you to — ” 

“Wait!” The scream was almost 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



more than a man could take. It 
was almost like that flare of light. 

f I '' HE monkey stood there in the 
middle of the messhall, going 
mad again. “Wait, wait, wait! I 
got to know. You all know. I 
don’t. What happened?” 

“Come on, Blum,” I said quick- 
ly. I was afraid of him, but I 
think I was more afraid of the 
captain. He had a look on his face 
I never want to see any more. 

He brought the face close to 
Blum and said, “You want to 
know, well, okay, and I don’t see 
why I should waste time or pity 
on a goddam monkey. That bomb 
knocked off the planetoid and 
the Barrier, which is what we 
came here for, and it knocked 
off your Virginia because that’s 
what she was sent out for. Okay?” 

“What you want to kill her 
for?” Blum whispered. 

“You wouldn’t happen to know 
any other way to bring back our 
power plant, now would you?” 
snarled the captain. 

I tried to explain to the utility 
monkey. “She didn’t believe the 
plant could work, Blum. So it 
couldn’t work.” 

“I could make her believe. I 
could. I could.” 

We looked at him, the big 
tilted head, the trembling nostrils. 
He wasn’t going to get crazy 
mad, after all. He was going into 
something else. It scared me more 



than his going crazy mad would. 

He said, “It was you, wasn’t it, 
fixed it so she wouldn’t believe 
anything?” 

“She had a head start,” said the 
skipper, and turned his back. 
“Come on. Potter. Donato. You’re 
crew now, like it or not. Let’s 
get this can the hell home. We 
got news for the people.” 

“I never thought human beings 
could be like that,” Blum said 
very quietly. “I never believed 
they could.” 

“Get to bed, monk,” I said. And 
before I could stop myself, I 
begged him. “Please. Please, Blum 
— get out of his way.” 

He looked up into my face for 
a long time. Suddenly he said, 
“All right. Palmer.” Then he just 
left. 

I felt a lot better. Does you 
good to know you can handle 
people. 

“Bunk in, men. We jump ill 
five minutes.” The captain went 
forward to check his controls. 

“Well, don’t stand there!” I 
barked at them. “Bunk in, men!” 

‘You know what. Palmer, 
you’re a jerk,” Donato told me. 
Then we all bunked down. 

Four minutes went by. Five. 
I heard the whir of machinery. 

The lights went out. The whir 
was a moan, then a whine. The 
light came on dim, then bright, 
and flickering at the edges of the 
eyes. 



THE POD IN THE BARRIER

T DIDN’T figure it was any of 

my business, so I just lay there 
and waited. Pretty soon the cap- 
tain came back. He leaned 
against my cabin door and looked 
at me. 

“Something the matter?” I 
wanted to know, trying to sound 
intelligent. 

“Power plant’s out, is all.” 

“Oh,” I said. “Uh— what’s wrong 
with it?” 

He heaved a slow sigh. 
“Nothing. Only it doesn’t work.” 

“I guess I better get up,” I 
said. 

“Why?” he asked me, and went 
away. 

I got up anyway and went and 
told Donato and Potter and Eng- 
land. They stayed where they 
were. They didn’t like this quiet 
skipper with the quiet voice and 
no arguments. 

“You know, if he can’t fix it, we 
don’t go anywhere. The Luanae 
have no ships and we can’t reach 
any of their planets,” England 
told me. I’d as soon he hadn’t. 

I went to see Blum, for some- 
:hing to do. 

He had his eyes open without 
seeing anything and he was 
mumbling to himself. I tried to 
hear. 

“. a little kid, they say you 
have the same chance as every- 
body else, you believe them. ‘I’ll 
hold your bag,’ they say, ‘while 
you get the tickets. Don’t worry. 



I’ll be here when you get back,’ 
and you believe them . ‘Got a 
great job for you, son. Light work, 
big tips — ’ ” 

“Monkey,” I said. 

He looked up at me. “You 
know what. Palmer? She said 
if you don’t believe anything at 
all, you lose nothing when it 
all comes straight at last. It’s all 
come straight for me now, Vir- 
ginia. I can be safe now, Virginia, 
not believing. They can’t take 
anything away from you that 
way. You’re so right.” 

He went on talking like that 
for a long time. I left and walked 
forward and found the captain. 
He was in the control room 
jiggling a handle back and forth 
and not looking at it. 

I said, “Captain, that D-field 
the girl had — now could a person 
fall into that by himself — I mean 
without those Earth Worlds doc- 
tors and all?” 

“You sure you have to come 
bother me about it?” he asked 
in a whisper, not looking at me. 

I backed way off and said, I 
think I do. I think the monkey’s 
got a case of the same.” 

“Now that’s crazy! He’d have 
to have a real shock to get into a 
state like that. The monkey’s 
okay. Beat it.” 

“He’s mumbling how he doesn’t 
believe in anything.” 

So the captain went aft with 
me. He watched the utility mon- 



44 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



key for a time and then said, 
“Well, we^l fix it so he doesn’t 
believe one way or another,” and 
hit the man in the bed on the 
jaw so he slid up and banged 
his head on the inboard bulkhead. 

I could hear the monkey 
breathing and I could hear the 
steam turbine, on and on. 

I said, “I guess being uncon- 
scious doesn’t make any differ- 
ence to what you believe.” 

“You should know,” said the 
captain. “All right. Palmer, pick 
him up and bring him along.” 
“Where?” 

“Shut up.” 

IIE walked out. I guessed I’d 
better go along with him. I 
heaved and grunted the monkey 
up over my shoulder. I almost 
fell down with him. The captain 
was waiting in the corridor. He 
started to walk when I came 
out, so I followed him. We went 
down to pod level and forward 
to the airlock. Captain Steev be- 
gan to undog the inner lock. 

“What you going to do?” I 
asked him. 

“Shut up,” said the captain. 
“You fixing to kill this mon- 
key?” 

“You want to get home?” 

“I don’t know,” I said, and 
thought about it. 

The captain flung back the in- 
ner door and stood up. He said, 
“What’s your trouble. Palmer?” 



I said, “I don’t think I’m going 
to let you do this. Captain. 
There’s some other way. You 
don’t have to kill a little utility 
man.” 

“Put him in. Palmer.” 

I stood there with the limp 
monkey on my shoulder and 
glared at the captain while he 
glared back. I don’t know how 
that might have ended — I do, 
only I’m ashamed to say it — but 
there was a noise and a voice, 
and somebody stood up out of 
the lock. 

“Well, it’s about time,” Vir- 
ginia complained. “You had the 
inner lock dogged and I’ve been 
lying in there for an hour. I guess 
I went to sleep. Who’s that? 
What’s the matter with Nils?” 
The captain looked like a man 
with a cup of flour in the face. 
“Who told you to leave the pod?” 
“The Luanae,” she said calmly. 
“Inside my head, like. It was fun- 
ny. Told me how to get into the 
flight-suit and how to get the gas 
bottles and strap them all to- 
gether and use them to jet clear 
of the pod and that big gold 
thing. I got a long way away and 
then they told me to get back of 
a big piece of rock floating there. 
There was a lot of light. They 
told me when to go again, after 
the pieces stopped flying by. It 
was easier then. There’s a jet 
unit built right into the suit, did 
you know that? The Luanae told 



THE POD IN THE BARRIER 



45 



me how I was supposed to use it.” 
I got my jaw working and 
said, “What made you think you 
could make it go?” 

“Well, it’s the same kind of 
unit that brought us here, isn’t 
it? You can’t help believing your 
own eyes.” 

A T last the captain moved. Be- 
fore he could say a word, I 
slung the monkey down to the 
deck and pushed him. I bet the 
captain has been hit in his life, 
and maybe kicked, but I don’t 
believe anyone just up and 
pushed him in the chest. He sat 
right down like a child with his 
legs spraddled out, looking up 
at me. 

“Now you just stay there and 
shut up yourself,” I told him. 
“You’re always doing everything 
with these people the wrong way.” 
Virginia was kneeling beside 
the monkey. “What is it? What 
happened to him?” 

I said, “He got a bump, that’s 
all. Listen, if you don’t mind me 
asking, do you believe he loves 
you?” 

“Oh, yes!” she said immediate- 
ly- 

“Then I tell you what. You 
stay right here with him and 
rock him back and forth a little 
till his eyes open, hear? Then 
tell him that — tell him you be- 
lieve him. That’s all.” 



The captain scrambled to his 
feet and opened his mouth to 
bellow. I bellowed first. I don’t 
know where it came from, but I 
believed I could do it, and it was 
a time to believe things. 

“You! You get up forward and 
check your controls. This can’s 
going to take off like a scalded 
eel if you’ve left the controls 
open, and I don’t want these folks 
shaken up. Go on, quick! You’re 
the only one here who knows how 
to do that. I’m the only one who 
knows how to do this other. 
Right? Right!” I said and pushed 
him. 

He growled at me, but he went 
right up the ladder. 

I hunkered down beside those 
two people and looked them over. 
I felt fine, very fine. 

I said, “Virginia, you know 
what this is? This is the day 
everything all comes out straight. 
Right? Right.” 

“You’re a funny sort of man, 
Mr. Palmer.” 

“A clown, ma’am.” 

I made a face at her and went 
up the ladder. About the time I 
reached the top, the ship began 
to move. I fell right back down 
again, but they didn’t think it 
was funny. They didn’t even seem 
to see me. 

I climbed back up quietly and 
went back to my cabin.

are fairly indicative of the grow- 
ing ability of the ears tested . 

Hybridization produced more 
of a revolution than I had sus- 
pected — “approximately 10,000 
different varieties of corn have 
been developed!” 

Seedsmen have a natural deal. 
Their customers have to keep 
coming back because the cross- 
breedings that produce hybrids 
must be repeated every year. But 
the product pays off very heavi- 
ly: In 1938, fifteen million acres 
planted with hybrid seed yielded 
120 million more bushels than 
they had with open-pollinated 
seed. The increase must be even 
higher now, with better hybrid 
varieties. 

Incredibly, the rocky soil of 
New England yields far more 
corn per acre than the Corn 
Belt’s rich loam. 

Corn has a good many insect 
and fungus enemies; picture this 
vivid communique from the si- 
lent battlefield: “Poison bran 

baits are widely and successfully 
used for the control of grass- 
hoppers, armyworms and certain 
species of cutworms. Injury by 
the chinch bug can be much re- 
duced by dust-mulch or furrow 
barriers of various kinds to pre- 
vent migration of the bugs on foot 
from adjacent ripening or dying 
small grains. The best type of 
barrier includes the use of a thin 



line of coal-tar creosote applied 
on a low ridge to repel the bugs 
and direct them into postholes 
dug every 20 or 30 feet along 
the line.” 

Here’s a dandy game to be 
played on long, tiresome car 
rides: “To measure silage in a 
circular silo . square the dia- 
meter of the silo, multiply by 
.7854 and the depth of the si- 
lage ... if this is divided by 40, 
the number of pounds per cubic 
foot, one may determine the num- 
ber of tons of silage.” 

It is impossible to discuss corn 
without bringing in Henry A. 
Wallace, Roosevelt’s Secretary of 
Agriculture. He was the first in- 
dependent breeder of hybrid seed 
corn and is among the biggest 
seedsmen. He also originated the 
first corn husking contest, in 1922. 
Corn is Wallace and Wallace is 
corn. 

Not a word in the Encyclo- 
pedia, though, about whether corn 
always grows odd numbers of 
rows. A phone call to a seed com- 
pany, which I should have made 
in the first place, gave the an- 
swer. Seed corn is rated in even 
rows, from 8 to 20. 1 can’t imagine 
a cob with 20 rows; it must be 
as thick as a wrestler’s neck. 

I wonder if the anti-science 
fiction magazine also got clob- 
bered by readers. Probably, but 
you don’t see them retracting.

GALAXY SCJENCE FICTION 



Doat Age 

By JOHN BOLAND 

Maybe it wasn't Gil's fault 
— but why did he have to go 
make an irresistible object? 



P EACE and quiet, very 
little work, lots to eat and 
drink — that’s what I like 
in life, and I had them all at 
Hornwell. Yes, it’s a pity about 
the job, but I’m not blaming any- 
one but myself. They’ve all 
begged me to stay, but I couldn’t 
see any future in it. 

My name is Broadbrace — Doc- 
tor William Broadbrace — and 
when I was offered the job of 



senior medical man at Hornwell 
Research Foundation, to look 
after the health and well-being of 
the 547 men and women scien- 
tists who worked there, I took 
it. There was only one reason I 
didn’t jump at the chance — I’m 
not built for jumping. 

It didn’t take long to settle 
into a schedule. I had six as- 
sistants, who did the routine 
work, while I kept an eye on

things in general. The work of 
the Foundation went on with 
maximum speed and efficiency, 
and I was happy. I made two 
friends. One was the chief of the 
Foundation, Gilbert Smith; and 
the other was Harry Summerton, 
who was in charge of one of the 
projects. 

The three of us used to spend 
a lot of evenings together. We 
were all bachelors, so we had 
plenty of time to do as we 
pleased, and, as there was a large 
surplus of unmarried women at 
the Foundation, we three men 
kept together in a sort of mutual 
protection society. 

Harry was a good bit older 
than either Gil or me and he 
was inclined to be a bit forceful 
in his views. He had views, Harry 
did, on everything, whether he 
knew anything about the subject 
or not. But Gilbert was quite 
different. 

Six foot eight, thin, with a nar- 
row face and thick glasses, Gil- 
bert is a scientific wizard — 
there’s no other word for him. 
The only trouble is that he’s got 
a terribly sensitive nature to the 
sufferings of living creatures, so 
much so that he’s been known to 
free a trapped fly from a spider’s 
web, and then spend a sleepless 
night wondering whether the 
spider had died of starvation as 
a result of his interference. The 
least little, thing can upset Gil, 



and when he’s upset, the work 
of the Foundation suffers. 

Gil had been an orphan from 
babyhood; he’d been brought up 
by two maiden aunts, of whom 
he was very fond. The old girls 
had sold their communal home 
after he’d gone — apparently 
there’d been a row over pets. 
Aunt Maggie owned a dog; Aunt 
Clara owned a cat; the two ani- 
mals had fought, and that was 
that. The two old ladies had each 
bought a cottage, miles apart, 
and Gilbert used to spend one 
free day every month with Aunt 
Maggie, and another free day 
with Aunt Clara. 

^ I ■’HE phone in my bedroom 
rang and woke me up one 
night. It was Gil. He was in a 
dreadful state. He’d just come 
back from seeing his Aunt Clara. 
The old lady’s cat had just died 
and she was grieving deeply 
about it and this upset Gil. I had 
a difficult time getting him over 
the shock, but a fortnight later 
he went to pieces. He’d just 
called to see his Aunt Maggie at 
the very moment that her 
precious dog had died. 

Well, I had an awful time with 
him. He couldn’t sleep at night, 
worrying about his aunts; and his 
work, and the work of the Foun- 
dation, began to slide badly. I 
tried reasoning with him, but it 
only made him more depressed.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Good heavens, Gil!” I said. 
“Try to keep a sense of propor- 
tion. Cats and dogs can’t live for- 
ever. If people want pets that’ll 
outlive ’em, then I suggest they 
should go in for elephants or par- 
rots or donkeys.” 

Harry worked on him as well, 
but it made no difference. 

“You can’t replace cats or 
dogs,” Gil mumbled dispiritedly. 
“They’re special.” 

It was then that I made my 
mistake. “All right, then,” I said. 
“Why don’t you invent something 
to do just that? Something that’ll 
take the place of cats and dogs — 
something that could live for 
years and years.” 

Gil’s face smoothed immedi- 
ately, and for the first time in 
days, he began to look cheerful. 
“By the atoms. Doc, that’s not 
a bad idea! Not a bad idea at 
all!” A smile lit his narrow face. 
“Sure, why not? Build a — a spe- 
cial kind of pet.” 

Harry was shocked. “Now look 
here, Gil. You can’t do that. It 
wouldn’t be right. Machines, yes. 
The more of those we can invent, 
the better. But to make a pet, a 
living pet — why, it’s against 
policy, not to mention nature. 
And I’m surprised at you. Doc, 
for even mentioning it.” 

This, coming from Harry, was 
particularly good. His job at 
Hornwell is to design machines 
that are capable of independent 



thought; able to reproduce them- 
selves, locating and mining their 
own raw materials, refining and 
machining, and replacing any 
part that gets worn out. 

But Gil paid little heed to 
Harry. He was full of enthusiasm, 
bubbling over like a retort or 
whatever they use nowadays. 

IV EXT day, the Foundation 
’ was back on full production. 
Gil was at work again and every- 
one was happy. During the next 
few months, I. didn’t see much of 
either Gil or Harry. In a way, I 
missed the times the three of us 
used to spend together, but it 
meant I could spend the evenings 
in my bungalow without being 
disturbed, so there were compen- 
sations. 

Then, one evening, Gil called 
me on the phone and asked me 
to come across to his bungalow. 
When I got there, he was wait- 
ing outside on the porch, and 
he almost dragged me inside. 

“There!” he said triumphantly. 
“What do you think of that!” 
That was a ball of fur, about 
fifteen inches in diameter, resting 
on the middle of the carpet. 

“What’s it supposed to be?” I 
asked cautiously. You meet up 
with all sorts of queer things at 
Hornwell. 

“It’s a doat.” 

“A what?” 

“A doat. D-O-A-T. ‘Do’ for 



DOAT AGE 



51 



dog,’ ‘at’ for ‘caf — it combines 
their best qualities.” 

“Well, I’m glad you told me,” 
I said. “I’d never have guessed.” 
In appearance, it was just how 
a medicine ball would look if you 
covered it with fur — thick, shiny, 
dark brown fur, about two inches 
long. 

“Very interesting, Gil,” I said. 
“But what’s a doat for?” 

“It’s a pet — a remarkably 
hardy pet that will live as long as 
a human being. Longer, in fact.” 
I looked at the thing doubt- 
fully. I couldn’t see it taking the 
place of a real pet and I said so. 

“That’s because you haven’t 
seen anything yet,” he responded, 
and proceeded to give a demon- 
stration. “Here, Rover,” he called, 
snapping his fingers. “Heel, boy!” 
The doat changed shape, 
elongating itself, then moved 
toward him, its fur acting the way 
a tank-track does, so that it 
moved smoothly. When it got to 
within a few inches of his feet, it 
stopped, changed back into a 
sphere and barked. 

It worked on a system of pho- 
to-electric cells, Gil explained, 
plus sensitivity to smells and 
sounds, and was triggered off by 
the vibrations in his voice. It 
listened to what he said; then an 
internal computer sorted out the 
appropriate sounds and inter- 
preted them into action. A doat 
was strictly a one-man object. 

52 



All necessary data had, of course, 
been pre-fed into it by means of 
electrical impulses. 

The doat was a clever toy, but 
nothing more. 

“No, Gil,” I said. “That thing 
will never become popular — not 
as a pet.” 

The doat made a slight move- 
ment in my direction and 
growled. Gil laughed. “He can 
smell you don’t like him.” 

But I wasn’t to be put off. 
“They’d get too dirty, for one 
thing. All that fur, and rolling in 
mud and stuff — ” 

Of course, I should have known 
better than to think Gil would 
slip up on an elementary point 
like that. There was an elec- 
tronic-magnetic dirt and moisture- 
repulsion unit built in. No matter 
what sort of dirt and water the 
doat rolled in, it always came out 
immaculately clean and dry. 

“Feel it,” Gil said. “Isn’t it nice 
to the touch?” 

T BENT down and put my 
hand cautiously on the dark 
brown fur, then stroked it softly. 
Gil was right. It was pleasant to 
touch, warm, and soft as satin. 
The doat began to purr. It was a 
delicious sensation. 

“All right,” I said at last. “So 
I’m wrong. Maybe you have got 
something.” 

“You bet I have. My aunts will 
love ’em! I’ve only made this one 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



so far, but when I make an- 
other . He snapped his fingers 
again. “Come on, Rover. Let’s go 
show you to your Uncle Harry.” 

Harry was still at work in B 
Block Laboratory and he didn’t 
take kindly to having his work 
interrupted, but he couldn’t say 
much; after all, Gil is the chief. 
The doat’s tricks made no im- 
pression on him. 

Just as Gil had finished put- 
ting the doat through his tricks, a 
mouse scuttled across the floor of 
the laboratory. Before you could 
blink, the doat spun after the 
mouse at a' hell of a speed, catch- 
ing up with the tiny creature and 
rolling on top of it. When we got 
up to the doat, there was no trace 
of the mouse. 

“He’s assimilated it,” Gil ex- 
plained. Apparently the doat 
rolled on top of its food and ab- 
sorbed it — a much better system 
than the ordinary digestive ar- 
rangements, according to Gil. 

That was the only time Harry 
showed any enthusiasm, for we 
have a lot of trouble with mice 
at Hornwell. 

Naturally, it didn’t take long 
for news of the new type of pet to 
spread, and Gil gave the first doat 
the run of the Foundation until 
he could make two more for his 
aunts. He’d become rather fond 
of the first one and had decided 
to keep it for himself. And what 
a fuss women made of it! You’d 

DOAT AGE 



have thought it was a baby, the 
way they gurgled over it. 

It was at this time that we had 
the robbery. Harry had all his 
plans and filed reports stolen 
from B Block Laboratory. The 
security police brought in Scot- 
land Yard and everyone’s life 
was made a misery by the cease- 
less questioning that went on. It 
was all a waste, because the plans 
were never discovered. The thief 
or spy — or whatever he was — 
must have walked in in broad 
daylight, lifted the papers and 
walked out of the place again, 
because they’d been on Harry’s 
desk one minute, and the next 
they’d disappeared. 

Chief Detective Inspector Rail- 
ton of Scotland Yard was in 
charge of the investigations. He 
questioned me a dozen times and 
he was quite offhand, too, when I 
complained that I was used to 
having a little respect shown to 
me. 

I knew at once that he’d not 
solve the mystery, for he seemed 
to spend five minutes asking 
questions, and then to spend an 
hour playing with the doat. 

A T last he admitted failure, 
but before he left Hornwell, 
he had a last interview with Gil, 
and he persuaded Gil to make 
some more doats. 

“With those doats, sir, patrol- 
ling the place,” the detective said, 

53 



“why, there wouldn’t be even a 
mouse as could get past ’em! 
Have the place guarded by 
watchdoats and you’d be secure 
as the Bank of England!” 

After giving the matter a bit 
of thought, Gil agreed. There was 
an extra fence built round the 
Foundation and six doats were 
set to patrol the lane between the 
fences. Everyone slept soundly 
again, except for one time when 
there was a doat fight. 

From the noise, you’d have 
thought the end of the world was 
happening, but when we got 
there, instead of finding either of 
them torn to pieces, there wasn’t 
even so much as a torn-out hair 
to be seen. The two contrived 
creatures had been dragged apart 
and were standing growling at 
each other. 

The fight upset Gil. “I don’t 
get it. Doc,” he said to me. “I 
just don’t get it.” 

We were still standing in the 
open in our pajamas and bath- 
robes. Everyone else had gone to 
bed and the guards and the doats 
had resumed their interrupted 
patrol. 

“I built the doats so they’d 
respond only to certain impulses,” 
Gil went on. “They’ve got suffi- 
cient information tape-fed into 
them to do as they are told and 
to react under certain conditions. 
But I can’t for the life of me see 
how it’s possible for them to react 

54 



in any way against each other.” 

“Probably a trick of the light,” 
I said, anxious to get back to bed. 
“One of them mistook the other 
for an intruder or something.” 

There must have been an offi- 
cial report filed on the doat fight, 
because we had the Scotland 
Yard man down again, checking 
whether any attempt had been 
made to effect entrance into the 
place. There hadn’t, of course, 
but the detective had a bright 
idea. Was it possible for a doat 
to corner a man? 

One of the younger men, being 
a good runner, volunteered for 
the experiment. The detective 
briefed him and the young man 
set off. He ran about all over the 
place, pretending to peer into 
buildings, opening doors and win- 
dows, and then concealing him- 
self. At that point, Gil, acting on 
the detective’s instructions, set 
his doat, Rover, on the young 
man’s trail. 

For a few seconds, the doat 
rolled in circles; then it was off. 
It followed the trail of the “crimi- 
nal” without a mistake and at last 
flushed the youngster from the 
shed where he’d been hiding. 

The young man made a run for 
it, but the doat rolled after him 
and kept cutting diagonally be- 
tween his feet, eventually trip- 
ping him and bringing him to the 
ground. Then the doat stood 
guard a few feet away, growling. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



It was a magnificent demon- 
stration. I estimated that the doat 
moved at a speed of seventy to 
eighty miles an hour on the 
straightaway and had incredibly 
fast braking action. 

^ I HE detective went back to 
Gil’s bungalow and watched 
the elongated scientist feed his 
pet. Feeding a doat was simple. 
You placed a butcher’s bag of 
meat and fish scraps on a plate, 
not even bothering to empty the 
bag, with a saucer of milk beside 
it. The doat then rolled onto the 
bag of food, settling over it rather 
like a broody hen sitting down 
on a clutch of eggs, and when it 
rolled off the plate, there was no 
sign of fish, meat or paper bag. 
The milk disappeared in the 
same manner. 

After Rover had been fed, it 
began to purr. The detective was 
most impressed. 

“You know, sir,” he said to Gil, 
“if we could supply our men in 
the force with a doat apiece — 
why, I believe we’d cut crime by 
fifty per cent.” 

Gil promised to think about it 
and, for a few days, we had peace. 
Everything in the Foundation 
was running beautifully. Rover 
was still more of a pet than be- 
fore the demonstration and even 
Harry got to like him, although 
he’d often chased the doat out 
of B Block Laboratory, where it 

56 



used to go to be patted and 
fussed over by some of the young 
women who worked in there. 
Ever since the first day when 
Gil had taken him there. Rover 
seemed to have a fondness for B 
Block. 

But then he started mixing 
with the watchdoats and he spent 
a lot of time in their company, 
even to the extent of going on 
patrol once or twice. 

But the change didn’t seem to 
suit Rover. Every day its coat 
became duller, its movements 
slower, until it could hardly roll 
across the floor and onto a plate 
of food. Not that its appetite was 
impaired. Actually, it was eating 
even more than before, but in a 
listless kind of way. 

Gil was becoming increasingly 
unhappy about it, but I tried to 
tell him that it was merely a pass- 
ing phase. “You’ll see,” I said. 
“In a week, Rover will be back 
to normal.” 

But Rover wasn’t. Instead, two 
of the watchdoats came down 
with the same ailment. Gil was 
starting to lose sleep again, and 
so I said to him: “Good heavens, 
man! It’s bad enough when you 
lose sleep over the sufferings of 
human beings, but over doats — 
well!” Finally I had to be firm 
with him. “Take a day off,” I or- 
dered, “and go take a trip to visit 
one of your aunts.” 

He did, but when he didn’t re- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



turn, to say that there was a panic 
is to put it mildly. Security 
checked on his movements and 
the first jolt we got was when 
they reported that the cottage, 
where he had gone to see his 
aunt, was empty and for sale. 

And then they checked up on 
the other aunt and found that 
she’d gone, too. We were just 
getting to the point of calling in 
the police and military intelli- 
gence agents when Gil’s small 
sports car hove in sight and 
steamed to a stop at the main 
gate. 

TAESPITE my bulk, I was the 
first one to get to him. “Gil! 
You shouldn’t do this to me, man! 
Where have you been? Are you 
all right?” 

He climbed out of the car, un- 
folding himself section by section. 
Then he caught sight of the 
crowd of people all staring at him 
from behind the fences. 

“Is something wrong?” he 
asked. 

“We all thought you’d been 
kidnapped,” I scolded him. 

Well, it all turned out to have 
been a stupid mistake. His aunts 
had made up their quarrel when 
he’d presented them with the two 
doats, and they’d bought a larger 
house and gone to live in it to- 
gether. Gil had simply forgotten 
to notify us of the change of ad- 
dress. 



“That’s a fine thing,” I said. 
“Keeping me out of my bed all 
night, worrying myself to a 
shadow, and all because you for- 
got to give us the change of ad- 
dress.” 

But he wasn’t concerned with 
my feelings. He’d been out all 
night because one of the doats — 
the one he’d given to Aunt Clara 
— was going off-color. 

“The poor thing looks quite 
sick. Doc,” he said to me. “And 
my old aunts — you can imagine 
how they feel, especially after I’d 
told them that the doats would 
outlive them.” 

I couldn’t get Gil to forget the 
doats, so I asked Harry to speak 
to the chief. A fat lot of use Har- 
ry was. He made Gil worse. “Sup- 
pose you’ve synthesized some 
new disease along with these 
creatures,” Harry said accusing- 
ly, “a disease that can be trans- 
mitted from these — these me- 
chanical contrivances to real 
animals!” 

“For goodness sake, Harry!” I 
protested. “Why bring that up?” 

“It’s none of your business!” 
he snapped. 

None of my business! That’ll 
give you some idea of how our 
former tranquil friendship had 
degenerated. With Gil sleepless 
from worrying about the doats, 
and especially about Rover, the 
work of the Foundation was prac- 
tically at a stop. Almost every 



DOAT AGE 



57 



hour, there’d be a row between 
some of the staff and I was hav- 
ing to work overtime, trying to 
put things right. I knew that 
when the month’s progress report 
was sent to London, I would be 
the one blamed for the bad work 
being done. I would be blamed 
either for not asking for more 
help, or for not stopping the 
manufacture of the doats, or for 
something. Whatever happened, 
I’d be the one to get called on 
the carpet. 

So I finally went to see Gil 
with an ultimatum. “These 
doats,” I said. “Ever since you 
built the first one, there’s been 
nothing but trouble. So I’m going 
to give orders for them to be 
destroyed.” 

We had a first-class row, but 
at last I got him around to my 
way of thinking and he agreed. 
The watchdoats would be de- 
stroyed and he’d see to Rover 
himself. 

I came away from his office 
satisfied and issued instructions 
for the watchdoats to be caught 
and put to sleep. Three of them 
were already in a cage, sick, but 
the others were still rolling about 
loose. 

A FTER half an hour, we gave 
up the idea of catching the 
loose doats. The first time, they 
came when they were called. We 
penned them up, but within a 

ss 



few minutes, they seemed to 
sense what was in store for 
them and they broke out — very 
damned literally. They retreated 
to one side of the pen, then 
launched themselves across it at 
full speed, hitting the opposite 
wall with just about the impact 
of a cannonball. 

As they rolled swiftly away 
from their temporary captivity, 
an incident occurred which made 
me begin to wonder if perhaps 
our task was not going to be 
rather more difficult than I had 
at first thought. 

One of the doats rolled straight 
under the tracks of a bulldozer 
that was being used to clear the 
ground for laboratory extensions. 
When the bulldozer tracks rolled 
clear of the doat, the ball of fur 
was squashed flat and patterned 
like a waffle. But within seconds, 
it was circular again and rolling 
happily away, without so much as 
a curl in its fur, and barking at 
us as if in derision. 

I gave an order to the guard 
standing beside me. 

“I don’t like to do it, sir, and 
that’s a fact, but I don’t suppose 
there’s any other way.” He un- 
slung his tommy-gun and raised 
it. “A pity— I liked the creatures,” 
he added regretfully. 

And, with that, he took aim 
and triggered off a burst of fire 
at a doat that was frisking around 
some thirty yards away. The bul- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



lets whipped straight through the 
thing, knocking it back ten or 
twelve feet. Then, yipping madly, 
it ran away, hit time and again 
by more bullets. When the guard 
had expended two magazines on 
the one doat, he gave up. What- 
ever way you could destroy a 
doat, it wasn’t by bullets. 

Gil gave me the answer. In the 
formula he’d compounded for the 
doats, he had included a self- 
sealing mixture, rather like the 
stuff they use in fuel tanks in 
military aircraft. Any holes 
punched in a doat were automati- 
cally closed. 

Naturally, I wasn’t going to be 
beaten by a small item like that. 
I got the driver gf the bulldozer 
to dig a big pit and then we put 
plates of doat food at the bottom 
of the pit. The idea was that 
when the doats got hungry, they 
would go to the food, and when 
they were all in the pit, we’d 
flood it. It was a magnificent 
scheme. 

There was only one thing that 
defeated the plan — doats are un- 
sinkable. 

I went back to my bungalow 
to think things over. There was 
more than a threat of mutiny 
among the women; they were 
holding indignation meetings. I 
knew I had to work fast, before 
they went to see the chief and 
in one way or another got him 
to overrule me. 



T WAS on my second pack of 
cigarettes when I got a sum- 
mons to go to see Gil. He was a 
new man, beaming with joy. 

“Doc,” he said, taking me into 
the small yard at the rear of his 
bungalow, “I want you to tell me 
what you think of this.” 

He led me to the pen where 
Rover was being kept. Rover, 
bright-furred, was rolling round 
the pen at a tremendous rate, and 
in the middle of the pen were 
three other smaller doats, each 
of them about four inches in 
diameter. 

“Well, I’ll be damned!” I said. 
Then I glared at him accusingly. 
“Gil! You never told me that 
you’d built in that sort of 
mechanism!” 

“Doc, I swear that it’s as much 
a mystery to me as it is to you.” 
We argued back and forth for 
a long time before we found the 
probable solution — Harry’s ex- 
periment in B Block! Rover was 
always in there, and Harry had 
lost his notes and plans for a ma- 
chine that could think indepen- 
dently and that could reproduce 
itself. Suppose Rover had rolled 
in there, sat on the plans and re- 
ports, and absorbed them! That 
must have been the “robbery.” 
Gil and I had to laugh. There 
was I, trying every means I 
could think of to destroy the 
doats, when all that was wrong 
with them was that more were 



DOAT AGE 



59 



on the way! When the news got 
out, scores of females came to 
slobber over the kittups, as Gil 
had christened them, and within 
two days the watchdoats had pro- 
duced more. 

Then Gil’s aunties had an in- 
crease in their doat family and 
all was well. 

That was the start of a long 
period of ease and comfort for 
me. The Foundation work went 
along without a shadow of 
trouble, for everyone there was. 
under the spell of the doats, and 
even I felt grateful to the crea- 
tures. 

As time went by, there were 
more and more doats around the 
place— smooth-haired doats, wire- 
haired doats, tabby, black and 
white, ginger doats — all sorts. 

^ I '' HERE was only one slight 
ripple on the surface of our 
contentment and that was when 
a group of officials came to put 
a value upon our doats. The gov- 
ernment had decided to issue 
doat licenses. 

It was finally agreed that 
doats up to the age of six months 
would be free from registration. 
After that, their owners would 
have to pay a yearly tax per 
doat, such monies to be paid on 
each first day of January. 

And that, of course, was the 
government’s big mistake. If it 
hadn’t been for the tax, I’d go on 



working at Hornwell. But I’m not 
fool enough to stay. I’ve handed 
in my resignation and I sail next 
month to take up a post at a re- 
search establishment that is being 
built in New Zealand. 

Why? 

Because Britain’s finished. 
When January first came around, 
thousands of people turned doats 
out of their homes, in order to 
avoid paying doat tax. There 
were no Lost Doat Homes, so 
the creatures rolled over the 
countryside, multiplying rapidly 
by fission or budding or some- 
thing of the sort. Food’s what 
does it — and they eat almost 
anything. 

Now I’m no mathematician, 
but I can multiply two by two, 
four by four, sixteen by sixteen, 
and so on. Doats are indestruct- 
ible. Therefore, how long will it 
be before Britain is completely 
carpeted with a layer of the crea- 
tures? According to my calcula- 
tions, this will happen in a sur- 
prisingly short space of time. 

That’s why I’m getting out — 
going to a country thirteen 
thousand miles away, where I 
shall be able to spend the rest of 
my life in peace and not be 
drowned in a sea of doats. 

Yes, New Zealand is the place 
for me — halfway around the 
world. Only one thing bothers 
me: How far can a doat float?

BY WILLY LEY 



THE EARLIEST 



ROBOT 



H ere once again is a 
column based entirely on 
questions and suggestions 
from the readers. I’ll begin with 
an addendum to the piece on the 
golem and early robots in the 
April issue. It drew a fairly large 
amount of mail and several read- 
ers pointed out that I had not 
mentioned the “brazen man” Talos 
who protected the island king- 
dom of Crete. 

The first one to do so was L. 
Sprague de Camp; it happened 

61 



that we had a dinner meeting 
only a day or two after this par- 
ticular issue had appeared on the 
newsstands and he asked me how 
many years had gone by since I 
read Apollodorus. (Too many.) 
I have reread Apollodorus since, 
trying unsuccessfully all the while 
to remember just when I did 
read him for the first time. The 
book in question bears the simple 
title Bibliotheke (“The Library”) 
and is a straightforward and clear 
accounting of ancient Greek 
mythology, written, in all proba- 
bility, during the first or second 
century a.d. 

The author of the “Library” is 
now thought to have been a con- 
temporary of the Roman emperor 
Hadrian. Faint — very faint — in- 
ternal evidence in the book seems 
to indicate that he was an Athen- 
ian or at least knew Athens. His 
name may even have been Apol- 
lodorus, but, modern experts on 
Greek literature point out, he was 
not the same as Apollodorus the 
Grammarian of Athens, who 
flourished around 140 b.C. Be that 
as it may, the book is useful. 

As for the “early robot” Talos, 
Apollodorus the Mythographer 
has the following to say, in the 
translation by Sir James George 
Frazer; 

Putting to sea . they were hin- 
dered from touching at Crete by 
Talos. Some say that he was a man 



of the Brazen Race, others that he 
was given to Minos by Hephaestus; 
he was a brazen man, but some say 
that he was a bull. He had a single 
vein extending from his neck to his 
ankles, and a bronze nail was 
rammed home at the end of the 
vein. This Talos kept guard, run- 
ning round the island thrice every 
day; wherefore, when he saw the 
Argo standing inshore, he pelted 
it as usual with stones. His death 
was brought about by the wiles of 
Medea, whether, as some say, she 
drove him mad by drugs, or, as 
others say, she promised to make 
him immortal and then drew out 
the nail, so that all the ichor gushed 
out and he died. 

"RETELL, I freely admit that 
Talos had slipped my mind, 
but I wonder whether he should 
be regarded as the earliest robot. 
The family resemblance points 
more in the direction of a self- 
navigating missile. I’ll even re- 
frain from invoking Isaac Asi- 
mov’s Laws of Robotics, but I do 
feel that a robot is characterized 
by the fact that it takes and 
obeys orders. Talos, then, turns 
out to be very much of a border- 
line case. 

Another letter reminded me of 
the brazen giant in the City of 
Dis, the Lower Hell of Dante’s 
Inferno. In Canto XIV of the 
Inferno, one of the cantos de- 
voted to the Seventh Circle of 
Hell, an ancient giant made of 
several metals appears. Dante 
did make a reference to Crete, 



62 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



hinting at Tales, but the detail 
is taken from the Bible, namely 
Daniel ii, 32-34. 

You may remember that Ne- 
buchadnezzar, the king of Baby- 
lon, made the somewhat exces- 
sive demand on his “magicians, 
astrologers and sorcerers” that 
they should not only explain a 
dream to him, but tell him the 
dream itself which the king had 
forgotten. But Daniel told him 
that he, the king, had seen a 
great image in his dream: 

This image’s head was of fine 
gold, his breast and his arms of sil- 
ver, his belly and his thighs of brass, 
his legs of iron, his feet part of iron 
and part of clay. Thou sawest till 
that a stone was cut out without 
hands, which smote the image upon 
his feet that were of iron and clay, 
and brake them to pieces. 

I think I am justified in say- 
ing that this image does not ap- 
ply to our story, whether in the 
Biblical or in Dante’s version. 

The next case, also mentioned 
by several readers, is much more 
charming. One of my readers 
wrote : 

I think you have overlooked what 
may have been the first robot to 
appear on the stage — Olympia, the 
mechanical doll, in Offenbach’s 
opera The Tales of Hoffmann, which 
had its premiere in 1881. She is, of 
course, an imperfect robot, since 
she can speak only one word 
(“oui”) and has to be wound up 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



twice during the first act. But she 
was convincing enough to make 
Hoffmann propose marriage to her, 
and the role has been sung by all 
the great coloraturas of the past 
three-quarters of a century. More 
recently, she was portrayed in the 
movie version by Moira Shearer. 

Correct. I saw the movie and 
I know the opera. Nor did I for- 
get Olympia when I wrote my 
column. With regret, I rejected 
her as a mere mechanical doll. 

SHARKS IN FRESH WATER 

i^NE reader who lives in Chi- 
cago wrote to ask me 
whether it is zoologically possible 
for a shark to occur in a river, 
not merely alive, but hungry and 
in fighting condition. Seems he 
had come across a scene involv- 
ing a fighting shark in a river in 
a novel and was poised to attack 
the novelist in turn. But he 
wanted ammunition, specifically 
the statement that I said so. I 
told him to keep his typewriter 
covered, for sharks do occur in 
rivers. To comp>ensate him for the 
frustration of having to keep 
quiet, I told him another “fresh- 
water story” which should have 
amused him because he lives in 
Chicago. 

I got this story first-hand from 
the late Fletcher Pratt, who, a 
few years before his death, did 
some reading of European books 

63 



for a New York publisher for the 
purpose of finding out whether 
they were worth translating for 
the American market. Well, some 
of the books he read were French 
mystery stories and one of them 
had Chicago for its locale and 
dealt— naturellement — with gang- 
sters. One of them somehow got 
himself into the bad graces of 
some others and they decided to 
do away with him. But simply 
shooting him was too good for the 
guy. He had to die slowly and 
painfully. 

According to Fletcher, the 
story was rather well researched. 
The French author evidently had 
a map of Chicago on his desk, 
and when he used English words 
and phrases, he used them cor- 
rectly. Still — the gangster who 
was condemned to die was towed 
out into freshwater Lake Michi- 
gan for some thirty miles with a 
motor launch and then aban- 
doned in a rowboat, with food 
for just one day, without oars 
and without water! 

But to return to the fighting 
shark in a river. To begin with, a 
large number of different types 
of fishes spend part of their lives 
in fresh water and another part 
in sea water. Some, like the eels, 
normally live in fresh water, but 
go to the ocean to breed. Others 
reverse this process and live nor- 
mally in sea water, returning to 
the rivers for breeding. 

64 



Among those who apparently 
do not care whether the water in 
which they swim is salty or not 
are some sharks, a few rays and 
sawfishes. In fact, one shark is 
actually known as the Ganges 
shark (Carcharias gangeticus) 
and has attacked many people 
while they were ritually bathing 
in the holy river. 

Stories of attacks by sharks, 
generally speaking, are tradi- 
tional enough to be a specific 
type of story, which means that 
they are exaggerated more or less 
for the purpose of conforming to 
precedent. But the Ganges shark 
is greatly feared and there must 
be some reason for it. 

Nor is it restricted to the 
Ganges River; it seems to go al- 
most anywhere in and around 
the Indian Ocean. 

T CHECKED a publication of 
the Royal Zoological Society 
of New South Wales which is 
entirely devoted to sharks and 
rays in Australian waters. Ac- 
cording to this book by G. P. 
Whitley, the Ganges shark has 
been reported in Australian riv- 
ers, but Dr. Whitley still makes 
a cautious question mark because 
no specimens have been taken. 
He points out that some other 
sharks in Australian waters look 
sufficiently like C. gangeticus 
from a distance to deceive an 
observer. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



But it is certain that the 
Ganges shark occurs in all rivers 
and freshwater lakes of the Phil- 
ippines, provided only that these 
can be reached from the ocean 
without a dam or a waterfall get- 
ting in the way. Usually the 
Ganges^ shark is joined in these 
freshwater excursions by another 
typical saltwater fish, namely the 
sawfish (Prist is microdon ). As far 
as I know, this sawfish has never 
been reported to swim up the 
Ganges River, but it goes happily 
into the rivers and lakes of the 
Philippines. 

Albert W. C. T. Herre of the 
School of Fisheries of the Uni- 
versity of Washington in Seattle 
reported the amusing fact that 
some Filipino forest-dwelling 
groups, the Mandayas and Mono- 
bos of Mindanao, think that the 
Ganges shark and the sawfish 
are the males and females of the 
same species. The sawfish, prob- 
ably because of their special 
“decoration,” are thought to be 
the males, and the sharks the 
females. Possibly the Filipinos 
saw the two fish swim around 
each other full of mutual suspi- 
cion and took this to be the pre- 
liminaries for a mating. In reality, 
both the shark and the sawfish 
seem to return to the sea to mate. 

This sawfish has also been ob- 
served in the Amazon River and 
its tributaries, in the large rivers 
of Borneo and Sumatra, and even 



in Africa in the Zambesi River — 
below the great falls, of course. 

The sawfish was recently found 
in Lake Sentani in Netherlands 
New Guinea. The lake is located 
in the extreme northeastern part 
of the Dutch (western) portion 
of the island. The shortest dis- 
tance between lake shore and 
ocean shore is between 10 and 
15 miles (maps of this area aren’t 
too reliable yet) and the lake 
level is 250 feet above sea level. 
Geologists think that the lake 
once was an open bay which be- 
came separated and elevated by 
tectonic forces, possibly less than 
a thousand years ago. But this 
is long enough to have converted 
it into a freshwater lake by now. 

B oth sharks and sawfish live 
in Lake Sentani. The Dutch 
recently took two specimens of 
sawfish from it, measuring 9Va 
and 11 feet in length, and suc- 
ceeded in getting them intact 
(though dead) to Holland, where 
they have been mounted in the 
Rijkstnuseum van Natuurlijke 
Historie at Leiden. 

The scientific attitude is best 
illustrated by the remark of the 
curator, M. Boeseman, of the 
Rijksmuseum, that the transpor- 
tation of these bulky specimens 
by the Royal Dutch Navy is 
“much more remarkable than the 
occurrence of these specimens 
in fresh water.”

Naturally, the question came 
up whether the sawfishes are the 
descendants of fishes which were 
trapped when the lake was sep- 
arated from the sea, and which 
started breeding in fresh water, 
or whether there is a connection 
between the lake and the sea 
passable to marine fishes with 
the ability to live and thrive in 
both fresh and salt water. 

Local and, as Boeseman says, 
“rather unreliable” information 
says that there is a long, wind- 
ing river which is impassable in 
its upper reaches. “However,” 
Boeseman continued, “although 
conditions may prevent the in- 
trusion of specimens of the size 
we collected, it seems likely that 
small examples can make the 
journey, at least under favorable 
circumstances — for example in 
the rainy season.” 

A first report said that sharks 
also lived in the lake, but Curator 
Boeseman does not agree: 

Sharks were not collected in, or 
reported from, Lake Sentani, and 
they probably do not exist there. 
The only freshwater sharks we ob- 
tained [during an expedition from 
October 1954 to May 1955] were 
found in Lake Janoer, a rather large 
and almost circular lake (diameter 
approximately 5 miles) situated on 
the narrow neck of the Vogelkop 
Peninsula, lat. 135° east. The alti- 
tude is about 200 feet. The physi- 
cal characteristics of the effluent 
river Omba are insufficiently 
known, which makes it at present 

66 



impossible to establish with certain- 
ty whether the species is landlocked. 
The collected examples measure up 
to 5 feet and, according to a super- 
ficial examination, are closely re- 
lated to the landlocked shark from 
Lake Nicaragua and to the Ganges 
shark. 

It would be very nice if I could 
now climax this story with a 
shark in Lake Michigan or the 
Chicago River. Maybe, after the 
St. Lawrence seaway has been 
completed, a shark will show up 
in Lake Michigan to make things 
more intriguing along the Chi- 
cago lakefront. But right now the 
only example of such an occur- 
rence close to home happened 
much nearer to the Atlantic 
Ocean. 

The date was August 30th, 
1954. Two boys, brothers aged 
10 and 7 years at that time, were 
fishing in the Appomattox River 
from a bridge. They caught a fish 
which fought back energetically 
enough so that the boys had to 
club it to death. It was then meas- 
ured and found to be 27 inches 
long. Then the boys wondered 
what it was. Well, it turned out 
to be a female dogfish, Squalus 
acanthias, which properly be- 
longs in the Atlantic Ocean off 
the New England coast. 

This was the first and, so far, 
only report of an appearance of 
this fish in fresh water, just north 
of Farmville, Virginia (Prince

THE “FOOTLESS” BIRD 
OF PARADISE 

TF the questions seem to run 

predominantly along zoologi- 
cal channels this time, this is due 
to a kind of accidental selection. 
Actually there were quite a num- 
ber of questions about rockets 
and missiles in the mail, but 
these were all taken care of in 
the article on Our Missile Ar- 
senal. The robots and the zoologi- 
cal items were left over. 

The next zoological question, 
coming from New York City, is a 
simple one. Somebody’s wife had 
bought a beautiful colored print 
of the Great Bird of Paradise, 
maybe for framing, maybe for 
decorating a lampshade. Before 
the lady did anything with it, her 
husband looked at it and found, 
beneath the English name, the 
scientific name of the bird. It said 
Paradisea apoda and that caused 
the question. Doesn’t apoda mean 
“footless”? If so, how come, since 
the picture itself showed that the 
Great Bird of Paradise has pow- 
erful and large feet? 

I knew the answer, but just for 
fun I got Richard Lydekker’s 
Library of Natural History off the 
shelf to see what this standard 
work had to say about the case. 
What it did have to say made 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



me shake my head: “The great 
bird of paradise (Paradisea 
apoda ), which was the first known 
representative of the entire fam- 
ily, derives its specific name from 
having been described by Lin- 
naeus from a skin prepared in 
the Papuan fashion, with the 
wings and feet cut off.” 

Not so. Professor Lydekker. 
Carolus Linnaeus knew better, 
even though it is quite possible 
that the specimen he had, if he 
had a specimen, was footless. Lin- 
naeus gave the specific name 
apoda not because he did not 
know any better, but in order to 
commemorate the story of the 
“footless” bird of paradise. 

As a matter of fact, the very 
first description of the bird by 
Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan’s 
companion and chronicler, men- 
tions the feet of the bird and their 
color, which is surprisingly drab 
and “normal” when compared to 
the plumage. Pigafetta got back 
to Europe in the fall of 1522 and 
began writing his report for King 
Charles V soon afterward. 

In the meantime, stories of the 
footless bird had filtered to Eu- 
rope on the overland route, prob- 
ably going through several trans- 
lations. 

The name of the odd bird, for 
example, arrived in Europe as 
Manucodia; the Malay name is 
Manukdewata. The specimens 
which an artist saw and drew 

67 



somewhere were without feet, but 
not without their wings. 

Tyr OBODY knows why the feet 

* were often removed. The 
suspicion is that merchants 
thought it would increase the 
value. But this is only a suspi- 
cion. Moreover, the bird Manu- 
codia was really two birds: the 
description mixed the Great Bird 
of Paradise and the Royal Bird 
of Paradise. All this had to fuse 
into a coherent story somewhere 
and the place where it fused was 
the great Natural History of Kon- 
rad Gesner of Zurich. 

It was volume three of Ges- 
ner’s work, the liber tertius qui 
est de Avium natura, which ac- 
quainted Europeans with the 
marvel of the East. The book was 
published for the first time in 
1555 in Zurich, Switzerland. 

This is what Gesner told: 

In insulae Moluchis [the Moluc- 
cas] which are situated under the 
Aequinoctio [equator] a dead bird 
can be found on the ground or in 
the water which they call Manu- 
codiatam in their language that can- 
not be seen alive because it lacks 
legs and feet, even though Aristotle 
denies that a bird without legs and 
feet could be found. This one, which 
I have now seen thrice [probably 
meaning three different specimens], 
does not have any feet because it 
constantly sails high in the air. The 
body and bill resemble, both in 
size and in shape, that of the swal- 
low, but the tail and the wings. 



when outstretched, are larger than 
those of a hawk and approach those 
of the eagle, as regards their size . 
[The feathers] are very soft and al- 
most resemble the feathers of a 
peacock hen; they cannot be com- 
pared to those of the peacock 
rooster for they do not have the mir- 
rors [what in English is equally mis- 
leadingly called the peacock “eyes”] 
like those in the peacock male’s tall. 
The back of the male bird is hol- 
lowed and the female, as ordinary 
reasoning will make you under- 
stand, lays her eggs in the hollow, 
and since the female’s belly is hol- 
low, too, the eggs are hatched by 
these two hollows. From the male’s 
tail there hangs a thread, about 
three spans long and black in color, 
which is not quite round and not 
quite square [in cross section] and 
is quite similar to a cobbler’s wire 
and it is said that the female, while 
she hatches the eggs, is tied tightly 
to the male with this wire. 

Then Gesner added: 

This bird, I do believe, does not 
have any other food than dew, since 
Nature assigned him to live in the 
air only. But that it lives on air, 
or eats the pure air, cannot be true. 

Well, this was the story about 
the bird of paradise, as distinct 
from the reports about it. Piga- 
fetta, who had seen the living 
birds, had described their feet. I 
don’t know whether he had heard 
about the story or not. 

But Charles de Lecluse, a 
French physician and botanist 
who wrote under the name of 



68 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Carolus Clusius, did know about 
the story, and when he learned in 
1606 that several specimens of 
the bird had been received in 
Amsterdam, he went there to see 
for himself. The specimens were 
complete, with feet, and Clusius 
said so. This was a hundred and 
one years before Linnaeus was 
even born. 

So Linnaeus could not possibly 
have been fooled any more and 
he wasn’t. But Linnaeus thought 
of the story synthesized by Ges- 
ner when he made up the scien- 
tific name of the bird. 

THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN 

^ I ' HE last item is a question 
from a younger reader who 
wants to know what natural fact, 
if any, is the basis of the story 
of the Mountain of Lodestone in 
the Arabian Nights. 

To my knowledge, there is only 
one scientific paper dealing with 
this problem, written by the Ger- 
man geographer Oscar Peschel 
and published in a book of mis- 
cellaneous writings by him in 
1877. I have used Peschel’s paper 
once before (in the book Lands 
Beyond which Sprague de Camp 
and I wrote in 1951) and might 
as well do so again, for a quick 
check showed that no additional 
geographical paper on this theme 
has been published since. 

The earliest mention which 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



Peschel, or anybody else, could 
find was in the Geography of 
Claudius Ptolemaeus of Egypt, 
written, by an amusing coinci- 
dence, at about the same time as 
the book by Apollodorus the 
Mythographer, with which this 
column started out. 

He said that somewhere in the 
Far East, near the Islands of the 
Satyrs, lay an island which was 
just one enormous mountain of 
lodestone. If a ship built with 
iron nails passed close by, the 
magnetic mountain pulled the 
nails out of the ship which then, 
naturally, collapsed and sank. 
How that story came to Clau- 
dius Ptolemaeus is completely 
unknown, but it was possible that 
it had come from China. 

The sinologists consulted by 
Peschel could not find a Chinese 
book old enough to have served 
as a source. But they did find a 
later Chinese writer who said 
that he had derived the story 
from “an older book.” The name 
of this writer was So Sung and we 
know when he wrote because his 
book states that it was written 
when Jin Tsung was emperor. 
That, sinologists knew, had been 
from 1023-1063 A.D. 

This is what So Sung put 
down: “Near the promontories 
and peninsulae of the Chang-hai 
[the sea of Cochin China] there 
are shallow places and lodestones 
in such numbers that the large 

69 



foreign ships, which have their 
bottoms sheathed with iron, are 
attracted by them when they 
come near and never are able to 
pass these numerous places.” 
The truth here is very simple 
and obvious. It was not the iron 
sheathing which was to blame, 
but the deeper draft of the “large 
foreign ships” that prevented 
them from going where the shal- 
low-draft Chinese vessels went. 

The trouble with literary 
sleuthing is, of course, that the 
older Chinese book mentioned by 
So Sung may have drawn its in- 
formation from Ptolemaeus. 

The next source that can be 
dated accurately is another Geog- 
raphy, the author of which is 
usually called Edrisi, a rather 
drastic contraction of his name, 
which was Abu-Abdullah Mu- 
hammad ibn-Muhammad al-Ed- 
risi. 

E drisi, bom in Spain, lived 
from 1100-1166 A.D., mostly 
in Sicily. “The author of the Book 
of Wonders reports that no ship 
held together by iron nails can 
pass near the mountain Muru- 
keyyin without being attracted 
and held so fast that it cannot 
leave again.” 

The location of this mountain 
is somewhere to the south of the 
Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, the 
southern entrance to the Red 
Sea. This is not only much closer 



to home, it also no longer speci- 
fies that the Mountain of Lode- 
stone is an island — it could be a 
promontory. And Peschel felt that 
this was just an exaggerated ver- 
sion of a real fact related one and 
a half centuries later by Abu al- 
Fida (or Abulfeda) who spoke 
about a promontory with a few 
remarkable features: “an iron 

mine well inland on its back and 
a place where lodestone is found 
on the part surrounded by the 
sea.” 

The source for Sindbad’s 
mountain in the Arabian Nights 
is either Edrisi or the Book of 
Wonders mentioned by him. It 
may sound strange, but there is 
much reason to believe that the 
story did not go from Edrisi into 
the Arabian Nights directly, but 
via the German romance The 
Pleasant History of Duke Ernest 
of Swabia. This German romance, 
written about the middle of the 
twelfth century, is older than the 
Sindbad tales. 

The Middle High German epic 
Gudrun (or Kudrun) also men- 
tions the Mountain of Lodestone 
in a somewhat indirect manner. 
A ship is built using only copper 
nails and anchors of bronze are 
provided “so that the good heroes 
will not be troubled by the mag- 
net.” But Gudrun was written 
later, in the early thirteenth cen- 
tury, and since it was written 
for an audience which knew the 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



story of Duke Ernest, no direct 
encounter with the Mountain of 
Lodestone could be inserted. 

In this time, the mariner’s com- 
pass, invented by somebody liv- 
ing near the North Sea, was al- 
ready in use. The skippers knew 
it worked and that was presum- 
ably all they cared. But the phi- 
losophers wanted to know how it 
worked and argued that the 
needle was attracted by the more 
numerous stars of the northern 
sky. 

*'1 ■'HIS interest in the reasons 
for the functioning of the 
compass needle is responsible for 
the absolutely last appearance 
of the Mountain of Lodestone. 
The year was 1508 and the place 
was a new map of the world, com- 
piled by Johannes Ruysch. 

On this map, the Arctic Ocean 
begins under 70° of northern lati- 
tude. Ten degrees farther to the 
north there is a string of 18 
islands, alike in shape and size. 
Inside this string of islands there 
are four more islands. One is 
labeled Arumphei, another Hy- 
perborei, the two others insulae 
desertae. And to the north of 
them there is one more island, 
with a Latin inscription which 
says: “under the arctic pole a 
rock of magnet-stone, 33 Ger- 
man miles (150 statute miles) in 
circumference, surrounded by the 
amber sea.” 



Below the first string of 18 
islands and the tip of Greenland 
(which was drawn as being the 
easternmost projection of Asia) 
there is another Latin inscription. 
It reads: 

Hie incipit mare su^enum 
(Here begins the amber sea) 
Hie compassus navium non tenet 
(Here the nautical compass is no 
longer steady) 

nec naves, que ferrum tenent, 
revertere valent 

(and ships built with iron cannot 
return.)

The Sly Bungerhop 



By WILLIAM MORRISON 




C OLMER was five feet 
four inches tall and as 
ferocious as a baby bunny, 
but he had a powerful voice for 
the size of him. He was using it 
now. 

“You bloated battener on better 
men’s brains!” he thundered allit- 



eratively. “What makes you think 
you know more than I do about 
the future?” 

L. Richard de Wike fiddled 
nervously with the button that 
would summon his secretary, but 
refrained from pushing it. He 
sighed and allowed the storm of

vivid invective to burst around 
his ears. It was a part of his job. 

There are publishing-house edi- 
tors who are employed because 
of a great sensitivity to syntax 
and style; de Wike had a tin ear. 
There are editors who hold their 
jobs because of their ability to 



make friends and attract authors; 
de Wike got on badly with his 
own mother, and all subsequent 
relationships were worse. 

As an editor, de Wike had 
only one real talent and that was 
an ability to absorb punishment. 
It was enough. Let an author 



THE SLY BUNGERHOP 



73 



come in and blow his stack — no 
advertising! a miserable job of 
production! a deliberate, calcu- 
lated insult from Miss Hargreave 
on the switchboard, who pre- 
tended not to recognize his name! 
— and it was de Wike who had 
the task of riding out the storm. 

His title was Executive Editor, 
but it might just as well have 
been Whipping Boy. After half 
an hour’s exercise on de Wike, 
even the most outraged of authors 
found his passions spent and was 
then easy meat for whatever the 
other editors on the firm wished 
to do with him. 

This particular storm, though, 
showed no signs of spending it- 
self. 

A t a momentary lull, de Wike 
cleared his throat and said: 
“Now, really, Colmer. It’s only 
that the editorial board feels your 
picture of thirty-first-century life 
lacks a certain warmth. Surely 
you can understand — ” 

“Warmth!” howled Colmer, 
freshly enraged. “Good God, de 
Wike, this is my book and my 
future. I don’t tell you how to 
cheat an author out of his re- 
print royalties — don’t you tell 
me what the thirty-first century’s 
going to be like! Remember T ales 
of Millenium! Remember what 
Life said in its editorial about T 
Is for Tomorrow! Remember — ” 
De Wike closed his ears and 



concentrated on remembering. 
True, Colmer was the best science 
fiction writer they had. He was 
also the most temperamental. He 
didn’t look the part in either case 
— a mousy little man with thick 
glasses over his watery eyes; he 
was blind as a bat without them. 
His heroes conquered galaxies 
and alien maidens with equal ease 
and daring; Colmer himself had 
never ventured west of the Hud- 
son River nor north of his apart- 
ment on the Grand Concourse. 
But the critics loved him and the 
cash customers ate his books up. 
So - 

Crash! 

L. Richard de Wike pulled out 
the mental plugs in his ears and 
paid attention. Colmer had been 
making a point about the heredi- 
tary cretinism in the ancestry of 
all publishers’ men and had pulled 
off his glasses to gesticulate with 
them. He had gestured wildly and 
collided with the Luna Cup that 
rested proudly atop de Wike’s 
desk. The crash was the sound of 
the Luna Cup flying across the 
room and smashing into silver- 
plated scrap against the base of 
the marble bust of L. Richard de 
Wike as a boy. 

“Now, really, Colmer!” De Wike 
was horrified. It wasn’t just the 
cost of the cup — that had been 
only thirty or forty dollars. It was 
the principle. That cup was 
awarded for the best line of 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



science fiction books; it had been 
the property of de Wike’s firm 
for six years running and it had 
cost a pretty penny, indeed, to 
set up an organization willing to 
award it to them, to pay the ex- 
penses of the award dinners, to 
keep the judges complacently in 
line, year after year. 

Colmer stared blindly at de 
Wike. He said in a furious roar, 
“My only pair of glasses, ruined. 
And you worry about your lousy 
cup! Oh, you’ll pay for this, de 
Wike!” 

And he blundered blindly out 
of the office, crashing against a 
chair, a file cabinet and the half- 
open door. 

^OLMER turned in the gener- 
^ al direction of the elevator, 
afraid of bumping into someone. 
Hamlet could tell a hawk from 
a handsaw, but Colmer couldn’t 
— not without his glasses, not 
from as much as a dozen feet 
away. Even a human figure 
merged into mists at six feet or 
so; he could tell that it was a 
figure, but identity, age and sex 
were beyond his recognition. Not 
that he much cared. The memory 
of his insults and ill treatment 
was too strong in his mind. 

“My only glasses!” he muttered 
searingly. “The thirty-first cen- 
tury!” 

A figure that might have been 
either a pink-faced baboon or a 

THE SLY BUNGERHOP 



fat man in a brown suit appeared 
out of the mists and murmured 
pleasantly: “This way, sir.” 

“Thanks,” growled Colmer, and 
fumbled his way to the elevator. 

Usually that was easy enough, 
even without his glasses; de Wike’s 
office was on the top floor, and 
ordinarily there would be one 
elevator waiting there, door open, 
until the starter on the ground 
floor buzzed it to start its descent. 
Not this time, though. All the 
doors were closed. 

Colmer found the handiest 
door, stuck his face almost into 
it to make sure it wasn’t another 
office, and located a signal button. 
Bending down almost to touch 
it with his nose to see that it 
wasn’t a fire alarm or Western 
Union signal, he put his forefinger 
on it and pressed. It was an ele- 
vator button, all right. It said, 
“Up.” 

He waited for a second, and 
then the door opened and he 
stepped in. 

Then something registered with 
him for the first time. 

De Wike’s office was on the 
top floor. 

But the button had said “Up.” 

He stared witheringly at the 
operator, a vague blue blur of 
uniform with a vague blonde blur 
of hair on top. Practical jokes? 

The operator said in a pleasant 
soprano voice, “Wettigo mizzer?” 

Wike demanded suspiciously, 

75 



“What are you talking about?” 

“Ah,” said the pleasant soprano, 
and then there was a sort of flat, 
fleshy click, as though she had 
popped her bubble-gum. “Where 
to, sir?” she asked. 

‘Where to!” he mimicked. 
‘Where the devil can I go to? 
Down, of course! I want to get 
out of this confounded place be- 
fore — ” 

“Sorry, sir. This car only goes 
up. Where would you like to 
stop?” 

“Now stop that!” he command- 
ed. Up! There simply was no 
up, not from de Wike’s office — 
not in this building. “I want to 
go down. I want to go down now. 
And no nonsense about it.” 

“Sorry, sir. This car only goes 
up. Where would you like to 
stop?” 

TTE stared at her, but her face 
was no more than a pink 
blur under the blonde halo. He 
would have liked to get a better 
look at her — he was nearly sure 
all the elevator operators he’d 
ever seen in this building were 
men — but, after all, you can’t 
put your face right up against 
that of a strange blonde with no 
better excuse than that you’ve 
broken your glasses. Or can you? 

The pleasant soprano said 
again, “Where would you like to 
stop, sir?” 

Like a damned parrot, he 



thought scathingly, or like a ma- 
chine. But what could you expect 
in a building tenanted by crea- 
tures like de Wike? 

He chose a number at ran- 
dom. “A hundred and tenth,” he 
snapped. “And let’s get started!” 
That would hold her. 

“Sorry, sir. We’re already 
started, but this car only goes 
up to ninety-nine.” 

“Ah,” he said disgustedly, “nine- 
ty-nine will do.” 

What was the use of going 
along with this nonsense? And 
the car certainly wasn’t moving; 
he was sure of that! He’d ridden 
in enough elevators to know. 
Why, his famous free-fall se- 
quence in The Martian Chanukah 
was based on an express eleva- 
tor ride from the top of the 
R.C.A. Building. If this were going 
up, he would feel heavier; if it 
were going down, he’d feel lighter. 
And all he felt was — why, he 
thought wonderingly, queasy. 
Maybe it was moving, some way 
or another; certainly he seemed 
to be having a little trouble keep- 
ing his balance. 

Colmer leaned against the back 
of the car and glowered blindly 
into space. Above the closed door 
there were winking pink-and- 
green lights — like an indicator, 
he thought. Well, all right, they 
were moving. Good. Since the only 
way to move was down, they 
would soon be at the ground

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



floor, and he would be out of 
the building, and then it was only 
a short cab-ride to the offices of 
Forestry, Brasbit and Hoke, who 
could be relied on to publish his 
books the way he wrote them, 
and who had said as much just 
the other day . 

Still, he thought, softening, de 
Wike wasn’t such a bad sort. As 
editors went, that is. And old man 
Brasbit was known to have some 
idiosyncrasies of his own — for 
example, there was the time he 
had hauled five of his own authors 
into court for violating the option 
clauses of their contracts— and, on 
the whole, de Wike’s firm could be 
counted on to be reasonable about 
things like that. If a better offer 
turned up for a particular book, 
they wouldn’t usually stand in 
an author’s way. 

A ND this present difficulty — 
* well, who was to know whose 
impression of what the thirty-first 
century would be like was cor- 
rect? Colmer thought of it as 
harsh and mechanized; de Wike’s 
editorial board thought there 
would be more human softness. 
Well, why wasn’t that possible, 
too? Suppose in chapter nine- 
teen, for instance, he had the 
Eugenics Committee set aside the 
ruling that ninth cousins couldn’t 
intermarry and — 

“Here you are, sir. Ninety-nine.” 
“Oh.” Colmer blinked. The door 



was open and the queasy-making 
motion had stopped. “Thanks,” 
he said, and then, moved by a 
sudden impulse and the hell with 
what she might think of it, he 
put his face close to hers. 

She didn’t slap him. 

She didn’t draw back. 

She just stood there, waiting. 

Colmer was suddenly conscious 
of two things, one of them obvious 
because it was positive, the other 
negative and hard to trace. 

The obvious thing was that this 
was, indeed, a young lady — or 
a doll. The face was a doll’s face, 
with bright, unwinking blue eyes, 
pink and almost inhumanly per- 
fect features. 

The negative thing was harder. 
Something was missing. And then, 
in a moment, it came to him. She 
didn’t smell. 

Colmer was no lady’s man, but 
he had not completely isolated 
himself from them. Moreover, he 
read the magazines and — that 
unfailing barometer of what their 
readers really liked — the adver- 
tisements the magazines con- 
tained. He knew that no self-re- 
specting American girl would be 
caught dead without at least a 
few drops of scent behind each 
ear and maybe some sort of per- 
fumed liquid or spray on the hair, 
plus, of course, something dainty- 
smelling to protect her from per- 
spiration all day or all week long. 

But there was no odor whatso- 



THE SLY BUNGERHOP

ever to the bright and doll-like 
operator of the car. 

She said, inches from his face, 
“You get out here, sir. Ninety- 
nine.” 

A little afraid of her and more 
than a little perplexed, Colmer 
stepped out. She was pretty but 
vacuous and insistently repe- 
titious. He wondered if it was 
worth his while to ask the elevator 
starter about her. The starter 
should be right there, under the 
clock, or chatting with the owner 
of the cigar stand — 

Colmer looked blearily and 
wonderingly around him. 

No elevator starter. No cigar 
stand. No clock. 

Wherever he was, and his my- 
opic vision made it more than 
merely hard to tell, he was not 
in the lobby of the Pinkstone 
Building, where de Wike had his 
offices. 

As far as he could tell, he 
wasn’t in a lobby at all. 

^ I ■’HERE was a droning electri- 
cal sound in the air and a 
faint, sneezy tang of ozone. Long, 
glowing corridors spread away 
from him on either side, and 
though he could see no details, 
he could at least see that some 
of the glowing light came from 
objects in motion along the corri- 
dors. 

He peered unbelieving, shak- 
ing his nearly blind head. 

78 



This was the end, he thought 
sourly. If this was some trick of 
de Wike’s — if somehow de Wike 
had conspired with the operator 
to bring him to the basement of 
the building or — ' 

No. None of that was p>ossible. 

Colmer reached out one hand 
to the wall of the corridor for 
support, more moral than real, 
and recoiled. The wall was tin- 
gling and warm; it seemed to be 
vibrating. 

He screwed his eyes shut and 
opened them again. Near-sighted- 
ness was sometimes an oddly 
comforting affliction; by being un- 
able to see much of the world 
around one without glasses, one 
had sometimes the impression of 
being wrapped in warm and fuzzy 
cotton batting, insulated from 
harm. 

But not this time. 

This time, Colmer didn’t like 
the world around him and he 
wanted to know it better. 

He opened his eyes and placed 
his index lingers on the skin at 
the corners of the eyes, pulling 
them taut and Oriental. General- 
ly that helped; deforming the eye- 
ball by a little outside pressure 
sometimes partly took the place 
of glasses . 

Well, no. Or did it? He couldn’t 
tell. The vaguely glowing nim- 
buses of light that he could see 
moving did lose some of their 
fuzziness, but they were warped 

6AIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and distorted into shapes he 
couldn’t recognize — 

Or didn’t want to. 

He shook his head again and 
felt the beginning tremor of phys- 
ical feac. 

It was all right for philosophers, 
he thought numbly, to talk of 
being unable to distinguish dream 
from reality. Maybe they didn’t 
know whether they were Chinese 
sages or blue-bottle flies, but may- 
be they spent their time in a daze 
anyhow. Not Colmer. He knew: 
he wasn’t dreaming. This was in- 
credible, but it was real. You 
don’t have to pinch yourself to 
find out if you’re awake. You 
just know. When you stop know- 
ing, you’re — 

You’re crazy, he finished. 

TTE put that out of his mind, 
though not easily; but if he 
was crazy, there didn’t seem to be 
anything he could do about it. 

Drunk, maybe? No, he hadn’t 
had a drink that day — de Wike, 
that skunk, hadn’t taken him to 
lunch. 

Hypnotized? No, that was also 
pretty improbable; he had seen 
no one but de Wike; and de Wike, 
whose personality was neither 
electric nor even quite bearable, 
was not the sort of person who 
could hypnotize another. De Wike 
couldn’t hypnotize* a poet, much 
less a science fiction novelist, al- 
way alert for plot gimmicks. 



That seemed to leave insanity. 

Well, Colmer thought gloomily, 
facing up to it, most writers were 
nuts anyway, or else they would 
be real estate salesmen, where 
the big money was, or editors — 
De Wike kept pestering him about 
heading their science fiction de- 
partment. If that was the only 
remaining possibility, by all the 
laws of scientific evidence Col- 
mer had painstakingly learned 
at the feet of such Titans as Ein- 
stein, Jeans and Sherlock Holmes, 
then it had to be accepted as 
true. 

Unless — 

He laughed ruefully. It was a 
silly thought, but there was one 
other possibility. 

Suppose, for instance, that may- 
be one of the stories he made his 
living by was — well, true? 

It was funny. More than funny 
— it was downright hilarious; he 
was beginning to drink the stuff 
he made himself. But just sup- 
pose, he thought, stretching the 
corners of his eyes in a vain 
attempt to see just what the devil 
it was he had got into, just sup- 
pose there really was such a 
thing as, for example, a weak 
spot in the paratime web. What- 
ever that was. 

He’d used it glibly enough in 
stories and he had intended it 
to mean that certain places might 
be sort of gateways between the 
familiar world of H-bombs and 



THE SLY BUNGERHOP 



79 



TV commercials and — different 
worlds. Parallel worlds, in a space 
of more than four dimensions. 

Suppose it was true? Suppose 
the elevator had somehow trans- 
ported him into an if world or 
maybe another planet? 

There was a strange taste at 
the back of Colmer’s mouth. He 
looked around him with effort. 
Wherever he looked, the walls 
glowed with light. The ceiling — 
high overhead, as far as he could 
tell — also glowed. The light 
varied in color, but his eyes, even 
pulled out of shape, were too 
inefficient to pick out details. In 
some places, the lights were mov- 
ing. 

Now what would that be? A 
factory, perhaps? 

TTE suddenly got part of the 
answer. People, he thought. 
People walking. Their clothes 
were as luminous as the walls; 
maybe that was the moving blobs 
of light. 

Colmer took a deep breath and 
walked toward the moving lights. 

The confounded things pursued 
their own paths. He selected a 
lavender pair of blobs, hurried 
toward them; they were gone. 
Ducked into a doorway? He 
couldn’t tell. Disappointed, he 
stopped short. 

A pale blue glow appeared and 
came toward him. When it was 
a dozen feet away, he saw that 



it was in fact the approximate 
size and shape of a man. He 
cleared his throat and blocked 
the path. 

The pale blue glow said, “You- 
all tucker me?” 

Colmer jumped; deep-south 






80

Alabama he had not expected. 
He asked, “What?” 

“Dassita say. Tucker me?” 
Colmer said miserably, “I don’t 
know what you’re talking about. 
All I know is I pushed the up 
button and— well, here I am.” 



The man in glowing blue said 
something quick and impatient; 
Colmer couldn’t even hear him, 
much less understand. He turned 
away and called something to a 
glow of muted rose that was 
approaching down the hall. It 





THE SLY BUNGERHOP 



81 



sounded like, “Putta sly bunger- 
hop”; there was more to it, but 
not that Colmer could under- 
stand. 

The rose glow came closer and, 
in turn, revealed itself to be hu- 
man. 

There was a very quick, low- 
voiced conference, and then the 
rose glow said, “Que veut-vous?” 

French, thought Colmer. Could 
he be suddenly in France? He 
said slowly, “I only speak English. 
Can you tell me where I am?” 

Click-pop — it was the sound 
the elevator operator had made, 
like popping bubble-gum. Then 
the man in glowing rose said, 
“You are in the Palace Building, 
on the tenth floor. Can’t you see 
the signs?” It was a pleasant, re- 
assuring voice — but accented 
somehow. The accent was not 
French, whatever it was. 

Colmer said doubtfully, “I 
can’t see much of anything. My 
eyes are bad and I’ve broken my 
spectacles.” 

“Ah,” said the pale blue glow 
in a tone of satisfaction, “putta 
sly bungerhop.” 

“Wayman,” the rose glow said, 
and then, to Colmer, “You came 
in the slide?” 

“I came in the elevator, if that’s 
what you mean.” 

There was a silence, as though 
the man were studying him. 

Colmer made himself say, with 
studied indifference, “Just as a 

82 



matter of curiosity, could you 
tell me what planet we’re on?” 

^ I^HE man laughed, but there 
was a puzzled wonder in his 
laughter. “Excuse me,” he said, 
“we’re rushed just now — ” He 
began to move away. 

“Please,” Colmer begged blind- 
ly. “I’m serious. Are we on — uh 
— the planet Earth?” 

“Of course!” 

“How far away is the Sun?” 
“The Sun?” Pause. “I don’t 
know. Ninety million miles, some- 
thing like that.” 

“How many moons?” 

The man laughed again, but 
with a definite note of strain. He 
backed away. He must think I’m 
crazy, thought Colmer, and small 
wonder! 

“Wait!” Colmer called. “Look, 
can you tell me — let’s see, can 
you tell me where the manager 
is?” 

There would have to be a 
manager, or something like a 
manager, and maybe that would 
get him to someone who could 
explain things. 

“Manager?” The voice was 
doubtful. “I don’t know — oh, I 
see. Front office, eh? First floor.” 
“Thanks,” said Colmer grate- 
fully. “How do I get there?” 

“Side drop,” the man said im- 
patiently. 

“What’s that?” Colmer begged, 
but the man was gone. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Colmer cursed to himself. He 
should have saved a few choice 
words, he thought, and not wasted 
them all on an innocent like de 
Wike. He had never before met 
such unhelpful people. 

Still, maybe things weren’t so 
bad. Side drop. Maybe — 

He moved over to the side of 
the corridor. That might be the 
“side” part. He stuck his nose 
close to the wall and moved along 
until he found a pattern of lights 
that seemed to offer some help. 
The glow of lights in his near- 
sighted eyes nearly blinded him, 
but at least he could distinguish 
the fine details in the difference 
of color. 

These marks were red letters 
against a glowing gray back- 
ground — syncopated, sketchy 
letters that formed misspelled 
words: “Hozontal transmit,” “Noth 
End,” “Wes End,” and - “Syd 
Drop.” 

This was the place, all right. 
Now what? 

He ran his eyes along the walls. 
No buttons to push. Apparently 
there was some trick to it. He 
gingerly felt the wall all around 
the glowing words “Syd Drop” — 

It vanished. The floor fell away 
from beneath him. 

t' OR a second, he was petrified, 
and then some invisible force 
steadied him and he came to a 
stop. 



Now where was he? 

There were more moving lights 
here than on the tenth floor and 
some of them were approaching 
him. 

“Excuse me,” he said, clutch- 
ing at the nearest. “I’d like to 
talk to the manager, please, or 
whatever you call him.” 

Click-pop again. A woman’s 
voice this time. “Manager? One 
who manages — oh. North Trans- 
mit.” 

Apparently even the females 
of these people were sparing of 
words. He sighed and stuck his 
face up against a wall again. 
This time he knew what to ex- 
pect and he was not surprised 
when he suddenly felt himself 
clutched, whirled and carried 
rapidly in a horizontal direction. 
Off the “Noth Transmit,” he 
stared around, stretching his eyes, 
which were beginning to water 
and ache very much. 

There was a large glowing 
patch of white light set in the 
middle of the gray, and a green- 
ish glow moving toward it. He 
intersected the greenish glow. “Is 
this the manager’s office — I mean 
the front office?” 

The greenish glow growled at 
him and moved away. Colmer 
hesitated. Then he heard voices 
coming from behind the glowing 
patch of white. He moved toward 
it slowly. 

One of the voices was familiar. 



THE SLY BUNGERHOP 



83 



It was saying, “Thing temple sly. 
Putta bungerhop, thing.” 

Colmer pulled at his aching 
eyes again and saw, through the 
square of white, two lesser glows, 
one violet, one a familiar blue. 
That was the voice. It was the 
man he had met back on the 
tenth floor, here before him. 

Colmer sighed and felt his way 
through the glowing white door. 
As long as the man was going 
this way anyhow, why hadn’t he- 
escorted Colmer and spared him 
the nearly impossible job of find- 
ing his own way here? 

These people, curse their in- 
considerateness! 

p OLMER said loudly, “I’d like 
to speak to the manager.” 
There was no click-pop this 
time; the man answered him at 
once in English. “About what 
you’re doing here?” The voice 
was again accented, but in a way 
like nothing Colmer had ever 
heard. 

“That’s right,” Colmer said 
doggedly. “How did I get here?” 
“That’s what I was going to ask 
you,” said the manager. “Do you 
have a permit for the temporal 
slide?” 

“The what?” Colmer gritted his 
teeth. “Look, I was waiting for 
the elevator. I pushed the button 
marked ‘Up’ and the elevator 
stopped and — ” 

“Temple sly bungerhop!” 



crowed the enraging blue glow. 

The violet one, the manager, 
said, “Wait a minute. Where were 
you when this happened?” 

“Why — the Pinkstone Build- 
ing. The twentieth floor. That’s 
the top floor, you see, so I won- 
dered about that button. But I 
had just broken my glasses and 
I couldn’t see very well, so — 
well, here I am.” 

There was a rapid and con- 
fused babbling among the glows— 
more voices than two, Colmer 
realized, and by squeezing his 
eyes again, he discovered that 
there were at least half a dozen 
persons in the room. Colmer 
couldn’t follow a word of it, 
though it had a haunting famil- 
iarity, like syncopated and 
slurred English, until the violet- 
glowing manager’s voice said, 
“Wait a minute until everyone 
gets his translator on.” 

There was a series of tiny 
click-pops. 

“Now,” said the manager, 
“you’d better explain.” His tone 
was mild, but it seemed to carry 
a threat. 

Colmer said bravely, “I’ve got 
nothing to explain. I never saw 
this place before in my life. I’ve 
had the devil of a time getting 
around — practically had to feel 
my way— and your people weren’t 
very helpful, either. They didn’t 
tell me a thing except how to 
reach this place.” 



84 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Pause. Then the manager’s 
voice said meditatively, “That 
may be just as well. What do 
you think, Arrax?” 

A silvery glow just within the 
range of Colmer’s vision said, 
“But how did he find the tem- 
poral slide?” 

“What about that?” the man- 
ager demanded. “What were you 
doing just before that?” 

“Why — ” Colmer stopped, re- 
membering. “I was talking to my 
publisher. We’d been discussing 
a new book of mine — I’m a sci- 
ence fiction writer, you see. The 
book was about the thirty-first 
century. I said the thirty-first 
century was likely to be a harsh, 
mechanistic — ” 

“Out loud?” 

“What? Of course. How else?” 

44 A H,” said the distant bass 
rumble of the silvery glow 
in a satisfied tone. “And the 
monitor — ” 

“Yes,” agreed the manager, less 
satisfied. “The monitor vectored 
him in to the temporal slide and 
he pushed the slide button up. 
The question is, now what?” He 
paused. “You,” he said to Col- 
mer, “when did all this happen?” 
“When?” Colmer was com- 
pletely at sea. “About one-thirty, 
I’d say. I remember it was time 
for lunch and — ” 

“You misunderstand me. What 
year?” 



“What year?” Colmer blinked 
and a great light seemed to come 
over him. “Oh,” he said faintly. 
“Temporal slide, eh? What year? 
You mean — ” 

“Of course,” said the manager. 
“You got on the temporal slide, 
going up. You’re in the ninety- 
ninth century.” 

There was a ragged series of 
click-pops and another argument 
raged in the slurred and sketchy 
English. Colmer didn’t mind; it 
gave him a chance to catch his 
breath. 

What an opportunity! What an 
incredible, gorgeous, million-bil- 
lion - trillion - dollar opportunity! 

The ninety-ninth century and 
here he was smack in the middle 
of it! Let de Wike argue with 
him now — here was his chance 
to write science fiction that would 
live and sell and make his name 
famous forever! 

There was a sudden local con- 
centration of chatter at the door 
and then a new figure in a glow- 
ing suit — orange, this time — 
joined the party. He approached 
Colmer, close enough so that Col- 
mer could actually see the face. 
It was a man, not young, not old, 
no taller than Colmer himself, 
with a wise and patient and stu- 
dious face. He poked something 
glittering and gleaming under 
Colmer’s eyes. Flaring white light 
danced out and blinded Colmer 
for a second. 



THE SlY BUNGERHOP 



85 




“Hey! cried Colmer. “What the 
devil do you think you’re doing?” 
Click-pop^ a series of click- 
pops. The manager’s voice 
soothed, “Ogratz is a doctor. You 
understand, we have to have a 
doctor look you over.” 

“Oh, all right,” Colmer grum- 
bled. “Listen, I’ve got a million 
questions! My year was 1958. 
Now what happened right after 
that?” 

The booming silver-glow voice 
said, “The recommendation for 
the monitor, then, is to replace it 
with a human.” 

C OLMER interrupted : “Ex- 

cuse me! Now, after 1958, 
when was the next war? Did the 
Russians — hey! Ouch!” 

It was bright green light this 
time and it stung. The doctor 
said something under his breath 
in a satisfied tone. 

The manager’s voice said, “Ar- 
rax, the whole thing was a stupid 
error; I’ve always said that robot 
monitors were a false economy. 
We’ll have to change the code 
word. ‘Century’ isn’t any good 
now. Maybe we ought to replace 
the slide operators, too, but we 
can table that. As for this one — ” 
“You mean me?” Colmer 
yelped. “Look, get this fellow 
away from me, will you? I want 
to know about the H-bomb. Was 
it ever used? Did Nasser get—” 
“We’ll vote yes on the moni- 



tors,” said Arrax. “I leave the ar- 
rangements to you. What about 
him, Doctor?” 

The doctor stepped away from 
Colmer, scratching his cheek. 
“Well,” he said meditatively, “it 
checks. Fovea central, bilateral 
occlusions. Efficiency? I’d say fif-

teenth percentile rods, twenty- 
fifth cones — oh, yes. Without his 
glasses, he’s just about blind. 
Couldn’t have seen a thing.” 
Colmer began to grow irri- 
tated. “I told you I didn’t see 
anything. Now why don’t you get 
me some glasses as a starter? 



I’d like a look at what techno- 
logical wonders you people—” 

“Shall I?” asked the doctor. 

The manager chuckled. “Why 
not?” 

“Thanks,” said Colmer, grati- 
fied as the dim orange glow that 
was the doctor bent and did

something with what seemed to 
be the equivalent of a little black 
bag. “Now about my questions. 
Do you think you could spare 
me someone who speaks English 
to act as — ” 

“I have the report,” the man- 
ager said, ignoring him. “The 
people who spoke to him told 
him nothing of any consequence.” 

“Good,” said the silvery glow 
named Arrax. “Take care, then.” 

“Wait a minute!” Colmer cried. 
“That sounds as if you were go- 
ing to send me back! Please, just 
let me stay a little while, won’t 
you? I promise not to be any 
trouble! Listen, there must be 
lots of things I can do for you — 
bring you up to date on the 
twentieth century, maybe, or help 
your historians check facts, or — ” 

“Certainly,” soothed the man- 
ager. “Of course.” He advanced 
on Colmer and took his arm. “If 
you’ll just come this way, we’ll 
take care of everything. Into this 
little door — that’s right. And — 
here, don’t forget these — ” He 
pressed something into Colmer’s 
hand. 

There was a sudden flare of 
polychrome light, brighter than 
light had ever been before. 

The world went black, and 
spun, and then sharpened again. 
Colmer, ready for anything, fear- 
ful of everything, reached out, 
touched a wall, braced himself, 
turned — 

88 



A man was approaching him. 

“Arrax?” he called fearfully. 
“Dr. Ogratz? Manager?” 

“Why, Colmer!” said the voice, 
pleased. “I thought you’d gone.” 

It was L. Richard de Wike. 

Colmer slumped against the 
wall. It was all over. It was too 
late. 

^ ^TT EAVENS. but he has mel- 
lowed fast,” thought L. 
Richard de Wike. And it was true. 
Colmer had acted very peculiar- 
ly — what was that nonsense of 
looking for an “Up” button at the 
elevators? — but now he seemed 
quiet, mild, reasonable — almost 
dazed. 

“Look,” said de Wike eagerly, 
“suppose we go out to lunch? 
We’re reasonable men. It doesn’t 
matter about the Luna Cup — and 
I’m sure we can work something 
out about your book. After all. 
I’m no expert on what’s really 
going to happen centuries from 
now — ” 

Colmer turned and looked at 
him through his new glasses — 
funny, thought de Wike; I could 
have sworn he said those others 
were his only pair. And these 
were odd-looking, rose-pink, of a 
most unusual shape. 

“That’s true,” said Colmer at 
last. “And, damn it, neither am 
I.” 

De Wike blinked happily. 
“Why, now, that’s the way to 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



look at it, Colmer,” he said. “Let’s 
go to lunch now, shall we? Just 
you and I, eh?” 

Colmer paused. 

He looked around him, with 
the sharpness of vision the new 
glasses had brought. Here was 
where he had pressed the “Up” 
button (no button, no scar, no 
shadow now to mark where it 
had been.) There was where the 
monitor had met him, triggered 
by the code-word “century.” A 
secret recess in the wall? An 
imagined figure, born of sugges- 
tion and gullible neurones? 

Whatever it was, there was no 
trace of the monitor or its hiding 
place there, either. No trace of 
anything. No chance that, ever 
again, Colmer would find the 
key and unlock the door to the 
future, where — surely this time! 
— forewarned and careful, he 
would find some way to stay 
there long enough to learn. 

No chance? 

Colmer drew a deep breath, 
his first breath of hope and — 
greed? Whatever it was, greed 
or nobility, that makes men want 
to know what is forbidden to 
them. 

He said, “Sure, de Wike.” He 
said, “Certainly, de Wike, let’s talk 
things over. The two of us un- 
derstand each other, after all!” 
And he said, “Oh, by the way, 
de Wike— I just happened to 
think, de Wike. Haven’t you kept 



asking me to head up your sci- 
ence fiction book department?” 

A ND so it was that Colmer, 
rose-pink glasses and all, 
came to occupy the office next to 
de Wike’s, and the refurbished 
Luna Cup now sits atop his desk. 

He’s a good editor. He under- 
stands the problems of the writer; 
he sympathizes deeply; he com- 
prehends fully; and the contracts 
he signs give an author a full fif- 
teen per cent less than any other 
editor in the firm has ever been 
able to manage. 

His employers are well satis- 
fied, except for his one little idio- 
syncrasy. 

Editors do their work over the 
lunch table and maybe so, in a 
way, does Colmer; but what his 
colleagues see is a man who 
brings a brown-paper bag of 
sandwiches to the office every 
morning, and never steps out of 
the place at noon; and every day 
from twelve to one-fifteen, stands 
in the corridor outside his door, 
where once a blurred figure led 
him to a button. 

He has a sandwich in one hand 
and a dictionary in the other; 
and it is munch and read, munch 
and read, for seventy-five min- 
utes every day; and if there is 
a word that will unlock the moni- 
tor’s help again, it begins with no 
letter up through the letter R.

THE DARK STAR 

By WILLIAM TENN 

For everybody else, it is the 
anniversary of the first Moon 
flight, but for me — it's just 
a tragically comic Valentine! 



S O IT’S here again, is it? 
Another year and it’s here 
again. The Day. Only this 
time it’s the fiftieth anniversary. 
Your editors and program direc- 
tors will be really spreading 
themselves tomorrow. Celebra- 
tions in every major city on 
Earth, a holiday on every planet

of the Solar System, and on the 
Moon — well! Noisemakers for 
the schoolchildren, speeches in the 
parks, fireworks, drinking, danc- 
ing, parades — and you boys will

Go ahead, sit down and make 
yourselves comfortable. I’ve been 
expecting you. I don’t have very

much that’s new, I’m afraid. It 
will be just about the same old 
story everyone’s heard for the 
past forty-nine years, but they 
never seem to get tired of it, do 
they? 

Human interest, your editors 
call it. The story behind the news, 
the color behind the historical 
event. The strictly human side of 
today’s holiday— that’s all I am. 

Those of you who want any re- 
freshment, please help yourselves. 
I particularly recommend that 
Martian brandy; they’re turning 
out some highly drinkable stuff 
in New Quebec these days. No, 
thank you, young fellow, I’m 
afraid I can’t join you — a man’s 
lining gets real soft at my time of 
life. But I still like to watch, so 
drink up, all of you, drink up and 
drink hearty. 

The fiftieth anniversary. The 
years, the years! There I was, 
young and practically bubbling 
with high-test fuel like all of you, 
and here I am now, full of dod- 
dering, aimless talk. And in be- 
tween, a full volume of history, 
but such history as the human 
race has not written for itself 
since it began climbing down 
from the trees. 

And I was there on the very 
first page of that volume! 

1 WAS there, and Caldicott, 
Bresh, McGuire and Stefano. 
Just the five of us, five desperate 



and determined competitors, all 
that was left of an even hundred 
determined and brilliant young 
men that the best universities in 
the country had sent. We’d been 
examined mentally and examined 
physically, tested on our math 
and tested on our nerve, elimi- 
nated for this reason and for that 
reason, too tall, too slow, too 
heavy, too talkative — until only 
the pleased, happy and shakingly 
tense five of us were left. 

Then the finals began. 

Picture it, five young men on 
a plane bound for the Arizona 
Research Station, looking at each 
other, wondering who it was go- 
ing to be, who was going to end 
up the winner, the pilot of the 
first ship to land on the Moon. 
Each one of us wanting to be the 
man, the Columbus who would 
open up not a mere hemisphere 
but the incredible, infinite uni- 
verse itself. Each of us wanting 
to be that man so bad that we 
had terrible little aches running 
up and down our intestines. 

Try to picture the world we’d 
grown up in. The first radio-con- 
trolled rocket to burst outside 
the Earth’s atmosphere, the first 
piloted ship to go halfway to the 
Moon and back, the first robot 
craft to circle the Moon — inter- 
planetary travel, space travel, 
getting closer all the time. The 
newspapers full of it, the televi- 
sion full of it, our very grammar- 



THE DARK STAR 



91 



school textbooks chockful of it. 

And now, just as we’d gradu- 
ated, the question was no longer 
exciting but remote news. It was 
as personal as a new neighbor 
moving next door. Who was he 
going to be, what would be his 
name— that first explorer — that 
hero of all-time heroes? 

There were exactly five possi- 
bilities: Caldicott, Bresh, Mc- 

Guire, Stefano — and myself. The 
Moon ship had been built and was 
waiting for its pilot. One of us 
would be the modern Columbus. 

I remember glancing around 
from face to face in that plane 
and thinking to myself that we 
could have been brothers. Cous- 
ins, anyway. 

The ship had been built to ex- 
act specifications with regard to 
lift and mass, and there was only 
just so much room for the pilot. 
He had to fit into his cubicle like 
a machined part, which meant a 
maximum height and a maximum 
weight, but still nothing sacrificed 
in the way of strength and re- 
flexes. 

So' we were all, all five of us, 
small, stern-bodied men with al- 
most identical scholastic training 
behind us and almost identical 
psychological mechanisms inside 
us. The way we moved, the way 
we noticed things, even the way 
we talked — everything was re- 
markably, eerily similar. Espe- 
cially considering that we’d each 



come from a different part of 
the country. 

Any one of us would have been 
adequate. But the Moon ship had 
cost millions of dollars and nine 
years of painstaking construction. 
For that, they didn’t want ade- 
quacy; they wanted the best that 
could be found. 

E BEGAN talking to each 
other guardedly then, just 
before we landed at the Arizona 
Research Station. Not to make 
friends — hell, no! — but to get a 
line on relative weaknesses and 
strengths. Believe me, the differ- 
ences were almost microscopic. 

Stefano, for example. He had 
one more math course to his 
credit than I. Theory of Equa- 
tions, I think it was — and how I 
bit my lip over skipping it for the 
sake of the Glee Club Tuesday 
afternoons! But it was on the 
record that he’d sprained his back 
in a high-school football game. 
Of course, the sprain was ancient 
history and long over with; still, 
it was on his record. How would 
you figure it? 

And how would you figure, we 
wondered as we landed at the hot, 
dusty Station and were led right 
into our first testing complex, how 
would you weigh the balances of 
sexual involvement? McGuire 
was married, a newlywed, Caldi- 
cott and I were more or less en- 
gaged, while Stefano and Bresh 




92 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



were carefree characters who took 
what they could where they 
could. 

One way, engagement, mar- 
riage, pointed to an adjusted emo- 
tional life — and adjustment rated 
high. And someone to return to 
might provide that extra bit of 
incentive where the chances of 
return were considered no higher 
than two out of three. 

On the other hand, McGuire’s 
wife, my Irene and Caldicott’s 
Edna might be looked upon by 
the powers-that-were as so much 
psychological dead weight, so 
much extra responsibility and 
worry that the men involved had 
to carry. Stefano and Bresh, I 
could just hear some jowl-heavy 
individual in a white smock ar- 
gue, had nothing to concentrate 
on but themselves and the ship. 

I tell you, I began to get aw- 
fully moody and regretful about 
Irene. Fine, I’d say to myself, I 
love the girl. But did I have to 
go and get engaged? 

Yet there was no way to figure. 
You didn’t know how they’d rate 
it. 

Once we got into the routine at 
the Station, though, there was 
very little time to worry. Morn- 
ing after morning, we’d be 
dragged out of bed and, pushing 
our yawns in front of us, made to 
go through a round of tests. After- 
noon after afternoon, we’d get 
particularized instruction in the 



handling and maintenance of the 
Moon ship and made to go 
through the motions in a dummy 
model. Evening after evening, 
there’d be a light supper followed 
by a dessert of more tests, checkup 
tests, validation tests and reca- 
pitulation tests. 

Over and over again, they 
tested us where they had tested 
us before, mentally, physically, 
psychologically, always probing 
for a hair’s-breadth of difference, 
for a third decimal place of ad- 
vantage. 

And then, when we had reached 
the point where our reflexes had 
become edgy, where our dreams 
were eight hours’ worth of raising, 
flying and landing the ship, 
where we chewed bread in the 
mess-hall with the certain feeling 
that somewhere a stopwatch must 
be recording, the pressure came 
off abruptly. 

And the results were an- 
nounced. 

T WAS first, by a millimicron. 
-*■ Bresh was second, by the same 
distance. Then came McGuire, 
Caldicott and Stefano. 

I was first! 

I would pilot the first ship to 
the Moon! I would be the new 
Columbus! I would start the era 
of space travel! 

We didn’t know who had in- 
vented the first crude tool, who 
had taken the first bareback ride 



THE DARK STAR

on a horse, but as long as human 
history endured, the name of the 
first man to leave Earth and land 
on another world would be cele- 
brated. And it would be my name 
— Emanuel Mengild. 

I felt like the ten-year-old kid 
who is suddenly told, all right, 
tomorrow he can go out West and 
become a cowboy — like the man 
lying on a flophouse bed who 
opens a telegram informing him 
he’s just inherited a million dol- 
lars — like the crackle-fingered, 
red-eyed seamstress who’s invited 
to go out to Hollywood and be- 
come a film star. But much more 
than all of those, for someone of 
my generation and background, I 
would pilot the first Moon ship! 

There were consolation prizes 
given out, too. If I dropped dead 
in the next week, or went crazy 
and refused to go, Bresh would be 
up. After him, of course, McGuire, 
Galdicott and Stefano, in that or- 
der. The way they looked at me! 

When I got the order to report 
to Colonel Graves, the Comman- 
dant of the Station, I swaggered 
all the way into his office. I wasn’t 
throwing any weight around. I 
just felt exactly that way. 

Any time up to today that his 
eye fell on me, I’d pulled my 
shoulders back a little further, put 
a little extra snap into my step. 
As Commandant, he was a mem- 
ber of the testing board, and, for 
all I knew, the decisive one. 

94 



There was always the possibility 
that he might notice me yawning 
a bit longer after breakfast than 
the others, that he might put that 
one extra question mark beside 
my name that would just make a 
vital difference. 

But now! Now he was simply 
George Johnstown Graves, a su- 
per-annuated rocket pilot from 
the old days when men had 
thought it exciting to climb high 
enough to see the Earth as a 
curving horizon beneath. He was 
courageous enough and smart 
enough and fast enough, but he’d 
been born a mite too early. For 
all his rank, he was just a Portu- 
guese fisherman, while I — well, as 
I said, I was Columbus. 

TTE WAS middle height, a bit 
taller than me, and he was 
leaning back in his swivel chair 
with his collar open, his sleeves 
rolled up and a funny, faraway 
look in his eyes which I inter- 
preted as envy. 

I sat down alertly in the chair 
he nodded at. 

He said “Um” at the opposite 
wall, as if he were agreeing with 
it. Then he looked at me. 

“Mengild,” he said, “you’re en- 
gaged, aren’t you? A Miss Rass?” 

“Yes, sir,” I told him snappily. 
The five of us were all civilians, 
but we’d gotten in the habit of 
saying “sir” to everyone, even the 
people who made up our beds. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



How did you know who would be 
contributing to the final, crucial 
decision? 

He glanced flittingly across his 
desktop. The desktop held a sin- 
gle folderful of papers, but closed. 
I had the impression that he’d 
memorized everything in the 
folder. “You’ve requested permis- 
sion to have her enter the Station 
tonight on a four-hour civilian 
pass?” 

I got a bit uncomfortable. 
“That’s right, sir. When the re- 
sults were posted, we were told 
we’d have a thirty-six-hour vaca- 
tion from classes. We were told 
we could invite any one outsider 
to join us for this evening. I got 
in touch with Irene — Miss Rass 
— and she’s flying down from Des 
Moines. I hope there’s nothing 
wrong with — ” 

Colonel Graves shook his head 
sharply. “Nothing. Nothing wrong, 
Mengild. You don’t expect to 
marry the lady before you take 
off, do you?” 

“No-o-o. We’d pretty much set 
it up the other way, sir. That is, 
if I were picked and I got back 
in one piece, we’d do it the day I 
landed back on Earth. She sort of 
wanted to get married first, but I 
talked her out of it.” 

“She knows your chances of re- 
turn in one piece are only slightly 
better than fifty per cent?” 

I felt relieved. I thought I un- 
derstood what he was driving at. 



“Yes, sir. But she still wants me 
to go. She knows how I’ve grown 
up with the idea. Irene wouldn’t 
want it any differently.” 

The colonel folded his hands 
under his chin and stared straight 
at me. “Miss Rass is a domestic 
type, isn’t she? Wants the usual 
things — a home, babies, so on?” 

“I guess so. She’s a pretty nor- 
mal girl.” 

“You want them, too?” 

I looked off to one side and 
thought for a moment. “Well, sir, 
I’ve wanted one thing since I was 
a kid and another for the past 
three years — space flight and 
Irene. And whatever Irene -wants 
in the way of a home, once I’m 
back, once I’ve made it, I guess I 
want that as well.” 

He examined the opposite wall 
again. When he got its opinion, 
he started talking at it in a low, 
soft voice. Didn’t sound military 
at all. 

?? A LL right. I’ll put it to you 
very briefly, Mengild. As 
you know, your engines are atom- 
ics and they have to be shielded. 
They are. Out in space, cosmic 
rays stream into the ship and it 
has to be shielded from them. It 
is. Thus far, except for a few un- 
fortunate and preventable acci- 
dents, we’ve had no trouble on 
this matter. The shielding we’ve 
devised is good and it works. But 
this will be the longest trip that 



THE DARK STAR 



95 




96 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a man has taken under these con- 
ditions and the very latest poop 
from the lab is that the shielding, 
in all likelihood, will not be effec- 
tive for its duration.” 

My lips suddenly weren’t 
working too well. “Does this 
mean, sir, that — ” 

“It means that the pilot of the 
first Earth-Moon ship will prob- 
ably bfe completely sterilized 
somewhere on the return journey. 
We could improve the shielding 
and no doubt will — in the future. 
To do it now would mean a long 
delay at best. At worst, it might 
mean completely redesigning and 
rebuilding the ship, which, as you 
know, has been figured for pretty 
close tolerances in terms of the 
equipment it can carry and the 
fuel it must carry. Our decision is 
therefore not to delay, but to put 
it up to the individual most con- 
cerned.” 

I thought it out for just a mo- 
ment, for one psyche-churning 
moment. “I can give you my an- 
swer right now, sir. I’ve spent too 
much of my life dreaming of — ” 
He said “Um” to the wall once 
more. “Suppose you take twenty- 
four hours. We can wait till then. 
Talk it over with your girl, try to 
find out exactly how you feel.” 

“I know exactly how I feel, sir. 
There’s nothing more important 
to me than this trip. And Irene 
will agree with me. If she doesn’t 
— well, as I said, there’s nothing 



more important than this trip. 
Why, do you think — do you 
think, sir, that after having come 
all this way, I’d let any risk, any 
risk at all, get in the way of my 
being the first man to make it to 
the Moon and back?” 

You can imagine that I was 
pretty excited. But Colonel 
Graves knotted his tie and rolled 
down his sleeves and said firmly 
to the wall: “Suppose you take 
twenty-four hours, Mengild.” 

The moment I got out of his 
office, I understood what he 
meant. Irene was due tonight. I 
wasn’t due to take off for close 
to three weeks. Plenty of time to 
get married, the way Irene had 
wanted to in the first place, and 
get a baby started. 

Of course. That’s what Colonel 
Graves had meant. 

Bresh and McGuire were stand- 
ing outside the administration 
building when I came down. They 
looked at me with carefully con- 
trolled eagerness. 

“No,” I told them, “it hasn’t 
been suddenly discovered that my 
grandfather took sick on his first 
airplane ride. I still go.” 

Bresh socked his forehead with 
a thumb-knuckle, just under his 
spiky red hair. “Well,” he grinned, 
“can you blame a guy for hop- 
ing?” 

I pushed between the death 
watch with both hands, on my 
way to my quarters to shower 



THE DARK STAR

and shave. I had to go through 
the same routine there with Cal- 
dicott and Stefano, although, be- 
ing lower on the list, they were 
less grisly. 

Vj^HEN Irene arrived at the 
** gate in the sand-streaked 
taxi, I hauled her into my arms 
and let her soak there for a 
while. She looked so good, she 
felt so good! 

We had a quickish snack at the 
recreation hall, while she filled 
me in on her mother’s sciatica 
and her kid brother Lennie’s art 
scholarship. Then she grabbed my 
hand and congratulated me on 
being selected for the Earth- 
Moon ship. 

“Let me show you what it looks 
like,” I suggested. “The next time 
you see it, it will be on the news- 
casts when I take off.” 

Irene glanced around as we left 
the rec hall. She pointed her little 
chin at the swarm of lab build- 
ings rising in concrete squareness 
from the raw Arizona earth, at 
the guards pacing their intervals 
along the wire fence. 

“Such a—” she thought for a 
moment — “such a male place.” 

I laughed. “What else should 
it be?” 

She came in on the tail end of 
my laugh. “What else?” she re- 
peated. 

It was getting dark by the time 
we reached the ship. Irene gave a 

98 



tiny and thoroughly feminine 
grunt of admiration. The ship 
stood on its tail, staring greedily, 
unswervingly at the enormous sky 
above. The lights from the station 
covered its sides with long thin 
glints and long thin shadows that 
seemed to be urging it to move, 
move, MOVE! 

“The first one,” she breathed. 
“And you’re going to pilot it.” 
I figured it was exactly the 
right time. So I hoisted her up on 
the steps that led to the pilot’s 
hatch, lit a cigarette for her — and 
started talking. 

It took a surprisingly short 
time, even including the proposal. 
She had barely smoked one-third 
of the cigarette when I finished. 
But she kept on smoking the rest 
in quiet, long inhalations until it 
became a butt that burned her 
fingers and she had to throw it 
away. 

I ground the butt into the sand 
and said, “Well?” 

Her next words kind of aston- 
ished me. “Well what?” 

“Well, we’re going to get mar- 
ried, aren’t we? Right away?” 
“No, we’re not,” she said. 
“Irene! But when I come back, 
I may not be able to have chil- 
dren. You want to have children, 
don’t you?” 

A long pause. I wished it 
wasn’t so dark: I couldn’t see 
her face. “Yes, I want to have 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



children. That’s why we won’t get 
married. Not before you go or 
after you come back.” 

I felt like saying Oh, no! I felt 
like grabbing her and squeezing 
her until she was my sensible, 
lovable, loving Irene again. In- 
stead, I stepped back away from 
her. I gave up talking and 
thought for a while. 

“Look,” I said at last. “Correct 
me if I’m wrong. You knew the 
risks I was running when I vol- 
unteered for this flight and you 
were with me all the way. You 
knew what it meant to me. You 
were willing to take the chance 
that I might not come back, and 
that if I did, it would be in three 
separate paper bags. This busi- 
ness is just some more of the 
same.” 

“No, it isn’t.” I could tell from 
her voice that she was crying. “I 
wasn’t happy about the risks, but 
I knew you had to do it. You’ve 
been preparing for this moment 
since you were a little boy. But 
this — this is different, Mannie.” 
“How is it different? How?” 
She wiped the sniffles off her 
nose-tip. “It’s different, that’s all. 
Maybe a man just can’t under- 
stand these things. But it’s differ- 
ent, altogether different for a 
woman.” 

“Baby, darling,” I said, trying 
to take her in my arms, but she 
made a little away movement and 
I stopped. “I want to have a 



child. I want to have a child with 
you. Will you please tell me why 
we can’t get married tonight, to- 
morrow, as soon as we can, and 
start a baby?” 

“Suppose I don’t get pregnant 
before you leave? And if I do — 
suppose I have a miscarriage?” 
“Listen, Irene,” I told her des- 
perately. “In my position, we 
could have the best doctors in 
the world taking care of you. And 
if anything went wrong, we could 
adopt a baby. I know it isn’t the 
same, but for all we know, one 
of us might be sterile to begin 
with! Lots of couples adopt ba- 
bies and they’re happy.” 

“Oh, Mannie, it wouldn’t be the 
same thing with us, not if we 
started out this way. Besides, mis- 
carriages, that sort of thing, that’s 
not the real reason.” 

I put my fists on my hips and 
shoved my face close to hers. 
“Well, will you kindly stop all 
this, woman, and tell me the real 
reason?” 

She asked me for another ciga- 
rette. I lit it up and handed it 
to her. 

“Mannie, I don’t know if you 
can understand this, but I’ll try. 
I wouldn’t want to limit my child- 
bearing powers in advance. And 
— I wouldn’t want to marry a man 
who would deliberately give up 
his ability to become a father. 
He’d never be completely a man 
to me.” 



THE DARK STAR 



99 



T hat took some absorption. 

“What would you think of a 
man,” I asked slowly, “who gave 
up his ability to make the kind 
of trip I’ve been offered? Would 
he be completely a man?” 

“I don’t know,” she said, crying 
again. “But I don’t think they’re 
the same thing. I don’t — I don’t 
— and that’s all!” 

“But that’s what you’re asking 
me to do, Irene,” I pointed out. 
“You’re asking me to give up a 
dream that I’ve had since I was 
a — ” 

“I’m not asking you to do a 
single thing, Emanuel Mengild! 
I’m only telling you what I can 
and can’t do. I, not you. You — 
you can go straight up in a 
rocket!” 

And that’s where we left it. I 
walked her back, walked her 
around, and, when her time was 
up, I walked her to the gate. We 
didn’t hug when she left; we 
didn’t even blow kisses at each 
other. I just stared after the cab 
until it sand-clouded around a big 
boulder and disappeared. 

Then I walked myself around. 
One way to look at it: I was 
in one Earth-Moon trip and out 
one woman. Rack up Fame and 
Fortune, scratch Family. 

One way to look at it. 

Another way: I could get mad 
at Irene for failing me at a cru- 
cial moment, for leaving when the 
going got rough. I got mad. 

100 



Then I got over it. 

After all, I could see her point. 
It wasn’t the same for a man as 
for a woman. A man had his work, 
his achievement; a woman had 
children. A woman grew up with 
the dream of kids the way I’d 
grown up with the dream of the 
stars. It wasn’t the same for a 
man. 

But wasn’t it? I began to real- 
ize, walking myself around and 
around in a plodding, sweaty 
circle, how much I had counted 
on Irene to come through for me. 
I wanted kids — only I’d never 
said to myself two kids, five kids. 
I’d settle for one. 

But no kids? Ever? 

I’d taken it for granted, I now 
understood, when Colonel Graves 
had hit me with the problem, that 
Irene loved me enough to marry 
me right away and cancel out 
the chance of having no family. 
That’s why I’d been so sure. That 
had been the little nubbin of 
security nestling comfortably at 
the back of my mind. 

This, now, was a different mat- 
ter. 

T T HAD taken a couple of bil- 
-*• lion years to produce me. In 
that couple of billion years, I had 
millions upon millions of ances- 
tors. Slimelike ancestors, jelly- 
like ancestors, water-breathing an- 
cestors, air-breathing ancestors, 
ancestors that floated, that swam, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



that crawled, that ran, that 
climbed, that finally walked. And 
all those ancestors, no matter 
how different, had one thing in 
common. 

They had survived long enough 
to have descendants. Other species 
didn’t and their lines were extinct, 
bare bones in rock strata. But no 
matter how scarce food got, no 
matter what enemies they faced, 
what unprecedented natural up- 
heavals they had to adjust to, my 
ancestors somehow managed to 
pull through and have offspring. 
That’s how I happen to be here. 

If I didn’t carry on, all their 
effort would come to nothing: I 
would be a biological dead-end. 
They might just as well not have 
bothered. 

"OUT that was only part of it, 
I decided, coming to the 
gate for the tenth time and start- 
ing off again. 

What was it all about, for ex- 
ample? What was I here for? 
What was good, what was bad, 
what was right, what was wrong? 
What in the world was I sure of, 
with all my studies, with all my 
aspirations, with all my attitudes? 
Very damn little. 

But while life continued, there 
was a chance of finding out, of 
getting a little closer, all the time 
a little closer. And my kind of 
life — me — could only find out if 
it went on. 



It was like, I decided, my en- 
tering this competition for the 
Moon ship. I’d entered it partly 
because I wanted to very badly, 
but also because I felt I was the 
right man. I possessed inside me, 
I believed, the values necessary 
to make that difficult attempt 
which would initiate the age of 
interplanetary travel. Well, rela- 
tive to life, I felt I was the right 
man, too. Both were conceits, but 
they were iundamental conceits. 
If I felt I was good enough, of 
value enough, I could not with- 
draw my entry. 

That got me to the Moon ship. 
Life wasn’t just reproduction — 
not human life. Life was achieve- 
ment, too. Mankind pushed its 
collective nose past barrier after 
barrier, because one of its com- 
ponent individuals just had to, 
whether or not he reproduced. 
And I lived in a time of a major 
barrier and it had fallen to my 
lot to do the pushing. Wasn’t that 
more important than children? 

On the other hand, I couldn’t 
fool myself — any of the other 
four men who had come out to 
the Station with me could do the 
job as well as I. And if this ship 
didn’t make it, another would. I 
wasn’t that necessary. 

But I wanted to be. 

So there I was, back again. I 
waved to the guard at the gate 
and kept going. By now, I’d worn 
a path for myself. 



THE DARK STAR

^ Y MOUTH felt as if it were 
full of wet splinters that had 
fallen out of my eyes when I re- 
ported to Colonel Graves the next 
morning. He stared at my face 
with a good deal of interest as I 
sat down. 

“It wasn’t so easy, was it, Men- 
gild?” 

“No, sir,” I told him unhap- 
pily, “it wasn’t. But I’ve made up 
my mind. And I’ll stick to the 
decision.” 

He waited. 

“I’ve decided — maybe I’ll re- 
gret this for the rest of my life, 
but, as I said, I stick by it — I’ve 
decided not to go.” 

“Um. The sterilization busi- 
ness?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“I take it the young lady said 
no,” 

I wiped my face with my wet 
handkerchief and shrugged. “She 
said no, all right, but that wasn’t 
it. I thought it over all night and 
this is my personal decision. I’d 
rather have children than have 
the Moon ship.” 

He rocked back and forth in 
his chair. “You know, Mengild, 
there’s such a thing as artificial 
insemination. And you still could 
be the father by being a donor 
before the takeoff.” 

“I can see myself,” I muttered, 
“running around with a test tube 
in my hand, trying to get women 
to marry me.” 



“Well, when you put it that 
way. I’ll admit it isn’t too roman- 
tic. However, there are women 
who would. Remember, Mengild, 
you’d be a hero, one of the great- 
est heroes of all time.” 

“Suppose it worked,” I chal- 
lenged. “Suppose I got married — 
to one of those women who would 
— and she were artificially insemi- 
nated and I were the father — 
what then if there were miscar- 
riages? Or abnormal births? The 
frozen spermatozoa don’t remain 
viable more than a year or two. 
But that’s only part of it, sir. The 
rest would be that I had volun- 
tarily and forever risked the 
chance of never becoming an an- 
cestor. I’ve decided I don’t want 
to.” 

Colonel Graves stood up. “Your 
business. And your decision. Cer- 
tainly. I made these suggestions 
because, frankly, we would rather 
have you pilot the ship. You’re 
a shade better than anyone else 
who competed with you. That 
would mean a shade better chance 
for the ship to get to the Moon 
and return. We want very much 
to have it return.” 

They offered the job to the 
next man in line and he jumped 
at it. They told him the problem 
and he laughed. They told him 
to take twenty-four hours to think 
it over, and he did, and he came 
back and said he still wanted to 
go.

Bresh, of course. 

He took off three weeks later, 
landed on the Moon and returned 
safely to one of the greatest and 
most heroic receptions ever. That’s 
why we celebrate Paul Bresh Day 
all over the Solar System. That’s 
why you reporters are here today 
for some of the usual human-in- 
terest fill-in material. 

And I can’t tell you anything 
more than I’ve told you before. 

No, that’s not so. There’s a new 
item. 

A S YOU know, I never married 
Irene. I married Frances, a 
year later, when I got that mainte- 
nance crew job. That’s all I’ve 
ever done for interplanetary 
travel — keep the ships in good 
shape for the flight into space. 
I’ve made a good living, even 
made a name for myself as a 
ground-crew chief. Now, naturally, 
I’m retired. 

I do regret that I never made 
a space flight when I was younger. 
Too old now, heart too weak, to 
be allowed even on one of those 



luxury passenger liners. 

Not like Paul Bresh. Besides 
making the first flight to the 
Moon in history, he was a mem- 
ber of the Second Exploratory 
Party to Mars; the time he sort 
of wandered off into the desert 
and was never heard of again. 

Me? All I have now is my son 
David and his wife in New Que- 
bec on Mars, my daughter Ann 
and her family on Ganymede, my 
daughter Mildred and her family 
on Titan, and — oh, yes, the new 
item. 

I got word last week that when 
the first star ship lifted from 
Pluto on its way to Alpha Cen- 
taurus, my grandson Aaron and 
his wife Phyllis were aboard. The 
trip will take thirty years, they 
tell me, so I’ll probably have a 
great-grandson born on the way. 

There it is, my side of the 
story. That’s what I got out of it. 
Maybe I didn’t become the new 
Columbus, but I’m an ancestor. 
Paul Bresh has his day. I have 
my millenia.

GALAXY'S 



5 Star Shelf 



ONE HALF OF THE WORLD 
by James Barlow. Harper, N. Y., 
$ 3.50 

k LTHOUGH not science fic- 
tion in the popular sense, 
Barlow’s book is a taut account 
of Occupied Britain in 1960. All 
of Europe except neutral Portu- 
gal has been subjugated; the to- 
tal destruction of London has re- 
sulted in England’s capitulation. 

As an American, I wonder why 
Barlow ignores the possibility of 
U.S. intervention. 

As the title implies, the world 
is divided, although there is no 



official state of war. The U.S. 
limits its activity to dropping am- 
munition along with an occasional 
mufti-clad spy to the Resistance 
groups. And therein lies the key 
to the power of this first novel. 

On the surface, the English 
countryside and populace are 
seemingly as unruffled as ever. 
Barlow’s hero, a plainclothesman 
in Internal Security, can be for- 
given, then, in believing that the 
entire populace, except for a few 
traitors, is in accord with the ad- 
mirable policy of the Occupiers: 
a comparatively free press, re- 
ligious freedom, the continuation

of British law, though without 
loopholes for legal wrigglings. 
He is happy in his job of check- 
ing sabotage and treason. 

Unfortunately, he is also an 
idealist and inevitably his con- 
science, and a teacher in the form 
of a young girl he has fallen in 
love with, combine to show him 
his error. 

Despite a cloying romance and 
a hero almost too good to be true, 
Barlow’s yarn has a frightening 
reality and urgency comparable 
to his countryman’s masterpiece, 
1984. 

CYCLE OF FIRE by Hal Clem- 
ent. Ballantine Books, N. Y., 
$2.75 

'C' VERY aficionado knows by 
^ now that Clement is the 
Alien spokesman on Earth. Very 
few authors can make the extra- 
terrestrial seem as human as the 
next-door neighbor — and much 
more likable. 

As in Needle and Iceworld, 
Clement interplays the person- 
alities of a juvenile human and 
a mature alien for intellectual 
contrast. The boy is a sixteen- 
year-old cadet who has been left 
for dead by his shipmates on a 
world with a weird environment. 
It circles a red dwarf which, in 
turn, is captive of a blue giant. 
During his long trek to the north 
for relief from heat. Nils Kruger 



stumbles on a crashed glider and 
an alien pilot dying of thirst on 
an old lava flow. He saves the 
pilot’s life, thereby starting a 
peculiar misunderstanding. 

Due to the knowledge the boy 
evinces concerning desert cacti, 
the alien assumes him to be in- 
digenous to the planet, whereas 
the youth is equally certain that 
the creature is, like himself, a 
maroonee. 

The major portion of the story 
concerns their odyssey to the 
Ice Ramparts where the alien, 
Dar, must take his books. Two 
facts strike the boy: Dar’s re- 
fusal to leave his books, and the 
alien’s knowledge of the time of 
his own death. Equally incompre- 
hensible to Dar is the uncertainty 
under which Nils must suffer 
about his death date. 

Clement is an adept at mak- 
ing outlandish concepts accept- 
able and logical. He is also ex- 
pert at visualizing wonderfully 
imaginative environments. Sor- 
rily, the story talks itself hoarse 
at the end, so that it falls quite 
short of Mission of Gravity.

factor. However, as have many 
authors before him, he rational- 
izes the physiological reasons for 
universal ascendancy of the bi- 
pedal man-image. Like Clement’s 
aliens, though, Oliver’s aliens are 
as human as all get-out. 

Wes Chase, a doctor on a 
Rocky Mountain fishing escape 
from his L.A. practice and an un- 
loving wife, gets kidnapped by 
a pasty-faced character with a 
potent hand weapon. He is held 
captive in a cave containing four 
bodies in niches while his captor 
painstakingly absorbs English. 
From that point on, the story 
rightly belongs to the Intruders. 
They’re far more interesting than 
Doc Chase. 

They are looking for a world 
with a spaceship technology and 
we don’t have it. However, there’s 
much more to it than that. 

I urge your getting acquainted 
with as nice a crew of extrater- 
restrials as can be imagined. 

MEETING PREHISTORIC 
MAN by G. H. R. von Koenigs- 
wald. Harper, N. Y., $3.50 

/^NE of the most painstaking 
of the geological sciences is 
paleontology. In Man in Search 
of His Ancestors, reviewed some 
months ago, Andre Senet made a 
quick round of the various finds 
concerning the origin of the race. 
He was able to make it quick 



because of the startling paucity 
of relics. 

Von Koenigswald, one of the 
most eminent authorities, has 
been instrumental himself in un- 
earthing unique finds in Java, 
near the site of the discovery by 
Dubois of Pithecanthropus erec- 
tus, for years the so-called “Mis- 
sing Link.” Because of a more 
complete skull dug up by the 
author. Pithecanthropus was 
found to be a true human. The 
author’s biggest discovery, though, 
was an even earlier ancestor. 

Von Koenigswald has hunted 
Ancient Man all over Earth, even 
in the chemists’ shops of China 
where dragon’s teeth are to be 
procured. Some of these turned 
out to be from Gigantopithecus, 
an eight-foot giant. 

An unusual fact tossed out by 
the author is that there is still 
less known about the antecedents 
of the anthropoid apes than about 
our own — there are greater dif- 
ferences between anthropoids and 
apes than between anthropoids 
and men!

Shadow World 

Of all the upsetting phenomena in the whole 
Galaxy, the most alarming was this: I had a 
little Shadow that went in and out with me! 



Illustrated by DILLON 




I ROLLED out early to put in 
an hour or so of work on my 
sector model before Greasy 
got breakfast slopped together. 
When I came out of my tent, 
Benny, my Shadow, was wait- 



ing for me. Some of the other 
Shadows also were standing 
around, waiting for their humans, 
and the whole thing, if one 
stopped to think of it, was abso- 
lutely crazy. Except that no one 



108 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 




ever stopped to think of it; we 
were used to it by now. 

Greasy had the cookshack 
stove fired up and smoke was 
curling from the chimney. I could 
hear him singing lustily amid the 

SHADOW WORLD 



clatter of his pans. This was his 
noisy time. During the entire 
morning, he was noisy and ob- 
noxious, but toward the middle 
of the afternoon, he turned mousy 
quiet. That was when he began 

109 



to take a really dangerous chance 
and hit the peeper. 

There were laws which made 
it very rough on anyone who had 
a peeper. Mack Baldwin, the 
project superintendent, would 
have raised merry hell if he had 
known that Greasy had one. But 
I was the only one who knew it. 
I had found out by accident and 
not even Greasy knew I knew 
and I had kept my mouth shut. 

I said hello to Benny, but he 
didn’t answer me. He never an- 
swered me; he had no mouth to 
answer with. I don’t suppose he 
even heard me, for he had no 
ears. Those Shadows were a 
screwy lot. They had no mouths 
and they had no ears and they 
hadn’t any noses. 

But they did have an eye, 
placed in the middle of the face, 
about where the nose would have 
been if they’d had noses. And that 
eye made up for the lack of ears 
and mouth and nose. 

It was about three inches in 
diameter and, strictly speaking, 
it wasn’t built exactly like an eye; 
it had no iris or no pupil, but 
was a pool of light and shadow 
that kept shifting all around so 
it never looked the same. Some- 
times it looked like a bowl of 
goop that was slightly on the 
spoiled side, and at other times 
it was hard and shining like a 
camera lens, and there were other 
times when it looked sad and 



lonely, like a mournful hound 
dog’s eyes. 

* I ’HEY were a weird lot for 
sure, those Shadows. They 
looked mostly like a rag doll be- 
fore any one had gotten around 
to painting in the features. They 
were humanoid and they were 
strong and active and I had sus- 
pected from the very first that 
they weren’t stupid. There was 
some division of opinion on that 
latter point and a lot of the boys 
still thought of them as howling 
savages. Except they didn’t howl 
— they had no mouths to howl 
with. No mouths to howl or eat 
with, no nose to smell or breathe 
with, and no ears to hear with. 

Just on bare statistics, one 
would have put them down as 
plain impossible, but they got 
along all right. They got along 
just fine. 

They wore no clothes. On the 
point of modesty, there was no 
need of any. They were as bare 
of sexual characteristics as they 
were of facial features. They were 
just a gang of rag dolls with mas- 
sive eyes in the middle of their 
faces. 

But they did wear what might 
have been a decoration or a 
simple piece of jewelry or a 
badge of Shadowhood. They wore 
a narrow belt, from which was 
hung a bag or sack in which they 
carried a collection of trinkets 



110 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



that jingled when they walked. 
No one had ever seen what was 
in those sacks. Cross straps from 
the belt ran over the shoulders, 
making the whole business into 
a simple harness, and at the 
juncture of the straps upon their 
chest was mounted a huge jewel. 
Intricately carved, the jewel 
sparkled like a diamond, and it 
might have been a diamond, but 
no one knew if it was or not. No 
one ever got close enough to see. 
Make a motion toward that jewel 
and the Shadow disappeared. 

That’s right. Disappeared. 

I said hello to Benny and he 
naturally didn’t answer and I 
walked around the table and 
began working on the model. 
Benny stood close behind me 
and watched me as I worked. He 
seemed to have a lot of interest 
in that model. He had a lot of 
interest in everything I did. He 
went everywhere I went. He was, 
after all, my Shadow. 

There was a poem that started 
out: I have a little shadow . 
I had thought about it often, but 
couldn’t recall who the poet was 
or how the rest of it went. It was 
an old, old poem and I remem- 
bered I had read it when I was 
a kid. I could close my eyes and 
see the picture that went with 
the words, the brightly colored 
picture of a kid in his pajamas, 
going up a stairs with a candle 
in his hand and the shadow of 



him on the wall beyond the stairs. 

I took some satisfaction in 
Benny’s interest in the sector 
model, although I was aware his 
interest probably didn’t mean a 
thing. He might have been just 
as interested if I’d been counting 
beans. 

T WAS proud of that model and 
I spent more time on it than 
I had any right to. I had my 
name, Robert Emmett Drake, 
spelled out in full on the plaster 
base and the whole thing was a 
bit more ambitious than I origi- 
nally had intended. 

I had let my enthusiasm run 
away with me and that was not 
too hard to understand. It wasn’t 
every day that a conservationist 
got a chance to engineer from 
scratch an absolutely virgin 
Earth-type planet. The layout 
was only one small sector of the 
initial project, but it included 
almost all the factors involved in 
the entire tract and I had put 
in the works — the dams and 
roads, the power sites and the 
mill sites, the timber manage- 
ment and the water-conservation 
features and all the rest of it. 

!• had just settled down to 
work when a commotion broke 
out down at the cookshack. I 
could hear Greasy cussing and 
the sound of thudding whacks. 
The door of the shack burst open 
and a Shadow came bounding 



SHADOW WORLD 



111 



out with Greasy just a leap 
behind him. Greasy had a frying 
pan and he was using it effec- 
tively, with a nifty backhand 
technique that was beautiful to 
see. He was laying it on the 
Shadow with every leap he took 
and he was yelling maledictions 
that were enough to curl one’s 
hair. 

The Shadow legged it across 
the camp with Greasy close 
behind. Watching them, I thought 
how it was a funny thing that a 
Shadow would up and disappear 
if you made a motion toward its 
jewel, but would stay and take 
the kind of treatment Greasy was 
handing out with that frying pan. 

When they came abreast of my 
model table. Greasy gave up the 
chase. He was not in the best of 
condition. 

He stood beside the table and 
put both fists belligerently on his 
hips, so that the frying pan, which 
he still clutched, stood out at a 
right angle from his body. 

“I won’t allow that stinker in 
the shack,” he told me, wheezing 
and gasping. “It’s bad enough to 
have him hanging around outside 
and looking in the windows. It’s 
bad enough falling over him 
every time I turn around. I will 
not have him snooping in the 
kitchen; he’s got his fingers into 
everything he sees. If I was 
Mack, I’d put the lug on all of 
them. I’d run them so fast, so 
far, that it would take them—” 



“Mack’s got other things to 
worry about,” I told him rather 
sharply. “The project is way 
behind schedule, with all the 
breakdowns we’ve been having.” 
“Sabotage,” Greasy corrected 
me. “That’s what it is. You can 
bet your bottom dollar on that. 
It’s them Shadows, I tell you, 
sabotaging the machines. If it 
was left to me, I’d run them clear 
out of the country.” 

“It’s their country,” I protested. 
“They were here before we 
came.” 

“It’s a big planet,” Greasy said. 
“There are other parts of it they 
could live in.” 

“But they have got a right 
here. This planet is their home.” 
“They ain’t got no homes,” said 
Greasy. 

TTE turned around abruptly 
and walked back toward the 
shack. His Shadow, which had 
been standing off to one side all 
the time, hurried to catch up with 
him. It didn’t look as if it had 
minded the pounding he had 
given it. But you could never tell 
what a Shadow was thinking. 
Their thoughts don’t show on 
them. 

What Greasy had said about 
their not having any homes was 
a bit unfair. What he meant, of 
course, was that they had no vil- 
lage, that they were just a sort 
of carefree bunch of gypsies, but 



m 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to me the planet was their home 
and they had a right to go any 
place they wanted on it and use 
any part of it they wished. It 
should make no difference that 
they settled down on no particu- 
lar spot, that they had no villages 
and possibly no shelters or that 
they raised no crops. 

Come to think of it, there was 
no reason why they should raise 
crops, for they had no mouths to 
eat with, and if they didn’t eat, 
how could they keep on living 
and if . 

You see how it went. That 
was the reason it didn’t pay 
to think too much about the 
Shadows. Once you started try- 
ing to get them figured out, you 
got all tangled up. 

I sneaked a quick look side- 
wise to see how Benny might 
be taking this business of Greasy 
beating up his pal, but Benny 
was just the same as ever. He 
was all rag doll. 

Men began to drift out of the 
tents and the Shadows galloped 
over to rejoin their humans, and 
everywhere a man ‘might go, his 
Shadow tagged behind him. 

The project center lay there on 
its hilltop, and from where I 
stood beside my sector table, I 
could see it laid out like a blue- 
print come to life. 

Over there, the beginning of 
the excavation for the adminis-

gleaming stakes for the shopping 
center, and beyond the shopping 
center, the ragged, first-turned 
furrows that in time would be- 
come a street flanked by neat 
rows of houses. 

It didn’t look much like a 
brave beginning on a brand-new 
world, but in a little while it 
would. It would even now, if we’d 
not run into so much hard luck. 
And whether that hard luck 
could be traced to the Shadows 
or to something else, it was a 
thing that must be faced and 
somehow straightened out. 

T?OR this was important. Here 
^ was a world on which Man 
would not repeat the ancient, sad 
mistakes that he had made on 
Earth. On this, one of the few 
Earth-like planets found so far, 
Man would not waste the valu- 
able resouces which he had let go 
down the drain on the old home 
planet. He’d make planned use 
of the water and the soil, of the 
timber and the minerals, and 
he’d be careful to put back as 
much as he took out. This planet 
would not be robbed and gutted 
as Earth had been. It would be 
used intelligently and operated 
like a well-run business. 

I felt good, just standing there, 
looking out across the valley and 
the plains toward the distant 
mountains, thinking what a fine 
home this would be for mankind.

The camp was becoming lively 
now. Out in front of the tents, 
the men were washing up for 
breakfast and there was a lot of 
friendly shouting and a fair 
amount of horseplay. I heard con- 
siderable cussing down in the 
equipment pool and I knew 
exactly what was going on. The 
machines, or at least a part of 
them, had gone daffy again and 
half the morning would be wasted 
getting them repaired. It certain- 
ly was a funny deal, I thought, 
how those machines got out of 
kilter every blessed night. 

After a while. Greasy rang the 
breakfast bell and everyone 
dropped everything and made a 
dash for it and their Shadows 
hustled along behind them. 

I was closer to the cookshack 
than most of them and I am no 
slouch at sprinting, so I got one 
of the better seats at the big 
outdoor table. My place was just 
outside the cookshack door, where 
I’d get first whack at seconds 
when Greasy lugged them out. I 
went past Greasy on the run and 
he was grumbling and muttering 
the way he always was at chow, 
although sometimes I thought 
that was just a pose to hide his 
satisfaction at knowing his cook- 
ing still was fit to eat. 

I got a seat next to Mack, and 
a second later Rick Thorne, one 
of the equipment operators, 
grabbed the place on the other 

114 



side of me. Across from me was 
Stan Carr, a biologist, and just 
down the table, on the other side, 
was Judson Knight, our ecologist. 

We wasted no time in small 
talk; we dived into the wheat 
cakes and the side pork and the 
fried potatoes. There is nothing 
in all the Universe like the morn- 
ing air of Stella IV to hone an 
edge on the appetite. 

Finally we had enough of the 
edge off so we would waste time 
being civil. 

“It’s the same old story again 
this morning,” Thorne said bit- 
terly to Mack. “More than half 
the equipment is all gummed 
up. It’ll take hours to get it 
moving.” 

TTE morosely shoveled food 
into his mouth and chewed 
with unnecessary savagery. He 
shot an angry glance at Carr 
across the table. “Why don’t you 
get it figured out?” he asked. 

“Me?” said Carr, in some aston- 
ishment. “Why should I be the 
one to get it figured out? I don’t 
know anything about machines 
and I don’t want to know. They’re 
stupid contraptions at best.” 
“You know what I mean,” said 
Thorne. “The machines are not 
to blame. They don’t gum up 
themselves. It’s the Shadows and 
you’re a biologist and them 
Shadows are your business and—” 
“I have other things to do,” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



said Carr. “I have this earthworm 
problem to work out, and as soon 
as that is done, Bob here wants 
me to run some habit-patterns on 
a dozen different rodents.” 

“I wish you would,” I said. “I 
have a hunch some of those little 
rascals may cause us a lot of 
trouble once we try our hand at 
crops. I’d like to know ahead of 
time what makes the critters 
tick.” 

That was the way it went, I 
thought. No matter how many 
factors you might consider, there 
were always more of them pop- 
ping up from under rocks and 
bushes. It seemed somehow that 
a man never quite got through 
the list. 

“It wouldn’t be so bad,” Thorne 
complained, “if the Shadows 
would leave us alone and let us 
fix the damage after they’ve done 
their dirty work. But not them. 
They breathe down our necks 
while we’re making the repairs, 
and they’ve got their faces buried 
in those engines clear up to their 
shoulders, and every time you 
move, you bump into one of 
them. Someday,” he said fiercely, 
“I’m going to take a monkey 
wrench and clear some space 
around me.” 

“They’re worried about what 
you’re doing to their machines,” 
said Carr. “The Shadows have 
taken over those machines just 
like they’ve adopted us.” 



“That’s what you think,” 
Thorne said. 

“Maybe they’re trying to find 
out about the machines,” Carr 
declared. “Maybe they gum them 
up so that, when you go to fix 
them, they can look things over. 
They haven’t missed a single 
part of any machine so far. You 
were telling me the other day 
it’s a different thing wrong every 
time.” 

Knight said, solemn as an owl: 
“I’ve been doing a lot of thinking 
about this situation.” 

“Oh, you have,” said Thorne, 
and the way he said it, you could 
see he figured that what Knight 
might think would cut no ice. 

“I’ve been seeking out some 
motive,” Knight told him. “Be- 
cause if the Shadows are the 
ones who are doing it, they’d 
have to have a motive. Don’t you 
think so. Mack?” 

“Yeah, I guess so,” said Mack. 

some reason,” Knight 
went on, “those Shadows 
seem to like us. They showed up 
as soon as we set down and 
they’ve stayed with us ever since. 
The way they act, they’d like us 
to stay on and maybe they’re 
wrecking the machines so we’ll 
have to stay.” 

“Or drive us away,” Thorne 
answered. 

“That’s all right,” said Carr, 
“but why should they want us to 



SHADOW WORLD 



115 



stay? What exactly is it they like 
about us? If we could only get 
that one on the line, we might be 
able to do some bargaining with 
them.” 

“Well, I wouldn’t know,” Knight 
admitted. “There might be a lot 
of different reasons.” 

“Name just three of them,” 
Thorne challenged him nastily. 

“Gladly,” said Knight, and he 
said it as if he were slipping a 
knife into the left side of Thorne’s 
gizzard. “They may be getting 
something from us, only don’t ask' 
me what it is. Or they may be 
building us up to put the bite on 
us for something that’s important. 
Or they may be figuring on re- 
forming us, although just what’s 
in us they object to, I can’t faintly 
imagine. Or they may worship us. 
Or maybe it’s just love.” 

“Is that all?” asked Thorne. 

“Just a start,” said Knight. 
“They may be studying us and 
they may need more time to get 
us puzzled out. They may be 
prodding us to get some reactions 
from us — ” 

“Studying us!” yelled Thorne, 
outraged. “Thes^re just lousy 
savages!” 

“I don’t think they are,” Knight 
replied. 

“They don’t wear any clothes,” 
Thorne thundered, slamming the 
table with his fist. “They don’t 
have any tools. They don’t have 
a village. They don’t know how 



to build a hut. They don’t have 
any government. They can’t even 
talk or hear.” 

I was disgusted with Thorne. 

“Well, we got that settled,” I 
said. “Let’s go back to work.” 

I got up off the bench, but I 
hadn’t gone more than a step or 
two before a man came pounding 
down from the radio hut, waving 
a piece of paper in his hand. It 
was Jack Pollard, our communi- 
cations man, who also doubled in 
brass as an electronics expert. 

“Mack!” he was hollering. “Hey, 
Mack!” 

Mack lumbered to his feet. 

Pollard handed him the paper. 
“It was coming in when Greasy 
blew the horn,” he gasped. “I 
was having trouble getting it. 
Relayed a long way out.” 

IV/fACK read the paper and his 
face turned hard and red. 

“What’s the matter. Mack?” I 
wanted to know. 

“There’s an inspector coming 
out,” he said, and he choked on 
each and every word. He was all 
burned up. And maybe scared as 
well. 

“Is it likely to be bad?” 

“He’ll probably can the lot of 
us,” said Mack. 

“But he can’t do that!” 

“That’s what you think. We’re 
six weeks behind schedule and 
this project is hotter than a pile. 
Earth’s politicians have made a 



116 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



lot of promises, and if those 
promises don’t pay off, there’ll be 
hell to pay. Unless we can do 
something and do it fast, they’ll 
bounce us out of here and send 
a new gang in.” 

“But considering everything, 
we haven’t done so badly,” Carr 
said mildly. 

“Don’t get me wrong,” Mack 
told him. “The new gang will do 
no better, but there has to be 
some action for the record and 
we’re the ones who’ll get it in the 
neck. If we could lick this break- 
down business, we might have a 
chance. If we could say to that 
inspector: ‘Sure, we’ve had a spot 
of trouble, but we have it licked 
and now we’re doing fine—’ if we 
could say that to him, then we 
might save our hides.” 

“You think it’s the Shadows, 
Mack?” asked Knight. 

Mack reached up and scratched 
his head. “Must be them. Can’t 
think of anything else.” 

Somebody shouted from an- 
other table: “Of course it’s them 
damn Shadows!” 

The men were getting up from 
their seats and crowding around. 

Mack held up his hands. “You 
guys get back to work. If any of 
you got some good ideas, come up 
to the tent and we’ll talk them 
over.” 

They started jabbering at him. 

“Ideas!” Mack roared. “I said 
ideas! Anyone that comes up 



without a good idea, I’ll dock him 
for being off the job.” 

They quieted down a little. 
“And another thing,” said Mack. 
“No rough stuff on the Shadows. 
Just go along the way we always 
have. I’ll fire the man who strong- 
arms them.” 

He said to me: “Let’s go.” 

I followed him, and Knight and 
Carr fell in beside me. Thorne 
didn’t come. I had expected that 
he would. 

TNSIDE Mack’s tent, we sat 
down at a table littered with 
blueprints and spec sheets and 
papers scribbled with figures and 
offhand diagrams. 

“I suppose,” said Carr, “that it 
has to be the Shadows.” 

“Some gravitational peculiari- 
ty?” suggested Knight. “Some 
strange atmospheric condition? 
Some space-warping quality?” 
“Maybe,” said Mack. “It all 
sounds a bit far-fetched, but I’m 
ready to grab any straw you 
shove at me.” 

“One thing that puzzles me,” I 
put in, “is that the survey crew 
didn’t mention Shadows. Survey 
believed the planet was unin- 
habited by any sort of intelli- 
gence. It found no signs of cul- 
ture. And that was good, because 
it meant the project wouldn’t get 
all tangled up with legalities over 
primal rights. And yet the minute 
we landed, the Shadows came gal- 



SHADOW WORLD 



117 



loping to meet us, almost as if 
they’d spotted us a long way off 
and were waiting for us to touch 
down.” 

“Another funny thing,” said 
Carr, “is how they paired off with 
us — one Shadow to every man. 
Like they had it all planned out. 
Like they’d married us or some- 
thing.” 

“What are you getting at?” 
growled Mack. 

I said : “Where were the 

Shadows, Mack, when the survey 
gang was here? Can we be abso- 
lutely sure they’re native to this 
planet?” 

“If they aren’t native,” de- 
manded Mack, “how did they get 
here? They have no machines. 
They haven’t even got tools.” 

“There’s another thing about 
that survey report,” said Knight, 
“that I’ve been wondering about. 
The rest of you have read it — ” 

We nodded. We had not only 
read it, we had studied and 
digested it. We’d lived with it day 
and night on the long trip out to 
Stella IV. 

“The survey report told about 
some cone-shaped things,” said 
Knight. “All sitting in a row, as 
if they might be boundary mark- 
ers. But they never saw them 
except from a long way off. They 
had no idea what they were. 
They just wrote them off as some- 
thing that had no real signifi- 
cance.” 

118 



“They wrote off a lot of things 
as having no significance,” said 
Carr. 

“We aren’t getting anywhere,” 
Mack complained. “All we do is 
talk.” 

“If we could talk to the 
Shadows,” said Knight, “we might 
be getting somewhere.” 

^^TJUT we can’t!” argued Mack. 

“We tried to talk to them 
and we couldn’t raise a ripple. 
We tried sign language and we 
tried pantomime and we filled 
reams of paper with diagrams and 
drawings and we got exactly 
nowhere. Jack rigged up that 
electronic communicator and he 
tried it on them and they just 
sat and looked at us, all bright 
and sympathetic, with that one 
big eye of theirs, and that was 
all there was. We even tried tele- 
pathy — ” 

“You’re wrong there. Mack,” 
said Carr. “We didn’t try telepa- 
thy, because we don’t know a 
thing about it. All we did was sit 
in a circle, holding hands with 
them and thinking hard at them. 
And of course it was no good. 
They probably thought it was 
just a game.” 

“Look,” pleaded Mack, “that 
inspector will be here in ten days 
or so. We have to think of some- 
thing. Let’s get down to cases.” 

“If we could run the Shadows 
off somehow,” said Knight. “If 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



we could scare them away—” 
“You know how to scare a 
Shadow?” Mack asked, “You got 
any idea what they might be 
afraid of?” 

Knight shook his head. 

“Our first job,” said Carr, “is 
to find out what a Shadow is like. 
We have to learn what kind of 
animal he is. He’s a funny kind, 
we know. He doesn’t have a 
mouth or nose or ears . .” 

“He’s impossible,” Mack said. 
“There ain’t no such animal.” 
“He’s alive,” said Carr, “and 
doing very well. We have to find 
out how he gets his food, how 
he communicates, what toler- 
ances he may have, what his 
responses are to various kinds of 
stimuli. We can’t do a thing about 
the Shadows until we have some 
idea of what we’re dealing with.” 
Knight agreed with him. “We 
should have started weeks ago. 
We made a stab at it, of course, 
but our hearts were never in it. 
We were too anxious to get 
started on the project.” 

Mack said bitterly: “Fat lot 
of good it did us.” 

“Before you can examine one, 
you have to have a subject,” I 
answered Knight. “Seems to me 
we should try to figure out how 
to catch a Shadow. Make a sud- 
den move toward one and he dis- 
appears.” 

But even as I said it, I knew 
that was not entirely right. I 



remembered how Greasy had 
chased his Shadow from the cook 
shack, lamming him with the 
frying pan. 

And I remembered something 
else and I had a hunch and got 
a big idea, but I was scared to 
say an3Tthing about it. I didn’t 
even, for the moment, dare to let 
on to myself I had it. 

“We’d have to take one by sur- 
prise somehow and knock him 
out before he had a chance to 
disappear,” Carr said. “And it 
has to be a sure way, for if we 
try it once and fail we’ve put the 
Shadows on their guard and we’ll 
never have another chance.” 

"J^TACK warned, “No rough 
stuff. You can’t go using 
violence until you know your 
critter. You don’t do any killing 
until you have some idea how 
efficiently the thing that you are 
killing can up and kill you back.” 

“No rough stuff,” Carr agreed. 
“If a Shadow can bollix up the 
innards of some of those big 
earthmovers, I wouldn’t like to 
see what he could do to a human 
body.” 

“It’s got to be fast and sure,” 
said Knight, “and we can’t even 
start until we know it is. If you 
hit one on the head with a base- 
ball bat, would the bat bounce 
or would you crush the Shadow’s 
skull? That’s about the way it 
would be with everything we 



SHADOW WORLD 



119 



could think of at the moment.” 
Carr nodded. “That’s right. We 
can’t use gas, because a Shadow 
doesn’t breathe.” 

“He might breathe through his 
pores,” said Knight. 

“Sure, but we’d have to know 
before we tried using gas. We 
might jab a hypo into one, but 
what would you use in the hypo? 
First you’d have to find some- 
thing that would knock a Shadow 
out. You might try hypnotism—” 
“I’d doubt hypnotism,” said 
Knight. 

“How about Doc?” I asked. 
“If we could knock out a Shadow, 
would Doc give him a going over? 
If I know Doc, he’d raise a lot of 
hell. Claim the Shadow was an 
intelligent being and that it 
would be in violation of medical 
ethics to examine one without 
first getting its consent.” 

“You get one,” Mack promised 
grimly, “and I’ll handle Doc.” 
“He’ll do a lot of screaming.” 
“I’ll handle Doc,” repeated 
Mack. “This inspector is going to 
be here in a week or so—” 

“We wouldn’t have to have it 
all cleared up,” said Knight. “If 
we could show the inspector that 
we had a good lead, that we were 
progressing, he might play ball 
with us.” 

I was seated with my back to 
the entrance of the tent and I 
heard someone fumbling with the 
canvas. 



Mack said: “Come in. Greasy. 
Got something on your mind?” 
Greasy walked in and came up 
to the table. He had the bottom 
of his apron tucked into his 
trouser band, the way he always 
did when he wasn’t working, and 
he held something in his hand. 
He tossed it on the table. 

It was one of the bags that the 
Shadows carried at their belts! 

We all sucked in our breath 
and Mack’s hair fairly stood on 
end. 

“Where did you get this?” he 
demanded. 

“Off my Shadow, when he 
wasn’t looking.” 

“When he wasn’t looking!” 
“Well, you see, it was this way. 
Mack. That Shadow is always 
into things. I stumble over him 
everywhere I go. And this morn- 
ing he had his head halfway into 
the dishwasher and that bag was 
hanging on his belt, so I grabbed 
up a butcher knife and just 
whacked it off.” 

A S Mack got up and pulled 
himself to his full height, you 
could see it was hard for him to 
keep his hands off Greasy. 

“So that was all you did,” he 
said in a low, dangerous voice. 

“Sure,” said Greasy. “There 
was nothing hard about it.” 

“All you’ve done is spill the 
beans to them! All you’ve done is 
made it almost impossible — ” 



120 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Maybe not,” Knight inter- 
rupted in a hurry. 

“Now that the damage has been 
done,” said Carr, “we might as 
well have a look. Maybe there’s a 
clue inside that bag.” 

“I can’t open it,” grumbled 
Greasy. “I tried every way I 
know. There’s no way to open it.” 
“And while you were trying to 
open it,” asked Mack, “what was 
the Shadow doing?” 

“He didn’t even notice. He had 
his head inside that washer. He’s 
as stupid as — ” 

“Don’t say that! I don’t want 
anyone thinking a Shadow’s 
stupid. Maybe they are, but 
there’s no sense believing it 
until we’re sure.” 

Knight had picked up the bag 
and was turning it around and 
around in his hand. Whatever 
was inside was jingling as he 
turned and twisted it. 

“Greasy’s right,” he said. “I 
don’t see any way to get it open.” 
“You get out of here!” Mack 
roared at Greasy. “Get back to 
your work. Don’t you ever make 
another move toward any of the 
Shadows.” 

Greasy turned around and left, 
but he was no more than out of 
the tent when he gave a yelp that 
was enough to raise your scalp. 

I almost knocked the table 
over getting out of there to see 
what was going on. 

What was happening was no 



more than plain solemn justice. 

Greasy was running for all he 
was worth, and behind him was 
the Shadow with a frying pan, 
and every jump that Greasy took, 
the Shadow let him have it, and 
was every bit as good with that 
frying pan as Greasy was. 

Greasy was weaving and cir- 
cling, trying to head back for the 
cookshack, but each time the 
Shadow got him headed off and 
went on chasing him. 

Everyone had stopped work to 
watch. Some of them were yell- 
ing advice to Greasy and some 
of the others were cheering on 
the Shadow. I’d have liked to 
stay and watch, but I knew that 
if I was going to put my hunch 
into execution, I’d never have a 
better chance to do it. 

So I turned and walked swiftly 
down the street to my own tent 
and ducked inside and got a 
specimen bag and came out again. 

I saw that Greasy was heading 
for the equipment p>ool and that 
the Shadow still was one long 
stride behind. Its arm was hold- 
ing up well, for the frying pan 
never missed a lick. 

T RAN down to the cookshack 
and, at the door, I stopped and 
looked back. Greasy was shinny- 
ing up the derrick of a shovel 
and the Shadow was standing at 
the bottom, waving the frying 
pan as though daring him to 



SHADOW WORLD 



121 



come down and take it like a 
man. Everyone else was running 
toward the scene of action and 
there was no one, I was sure, who 
had noticed me. 

So I opened the cookshack 
door and stepped inside. 

The dishwasher was chugging 
away and everything was peace- 
able and quiet. 

I was afraid I might have 
trouble finding what I was look- 
ing for, but I found it in the third 
place I looked — underneath the 
mattress on Greasy’s bunk. 

I pulled the peeper out and 
slipped it in the bag and got out 
of there as fast as I could go. 

Stopping at my tent, I tossed 
the bag into a corner and threw 
some old clothes over it and then 
went out again. 

^ I ’’HE commotion had ended. 

The shadow was walking 
back toward the cookshack, with 
the pan tucked underneath its 
arm, and Greasy was climbing 
down off the shovel. The men 
were all gathered around the 
shovel, making a lot of noise, and 
I figured that it would take a 
long, long time for Greasy to live 
down what had happened. Al- 
though, I realized, he had it com- 
ing to him. 

I went back into Mack’s tent 
and found the others there. All 
three of them were standing be- 
side the table, looking down at 

122 



what lay there upon the surface. 

The bag had disappeared and 
had left behind a little pile of 
trinkets. Looking at the pile, I 
could see that they were minia- 
tures of frying pans and kettles 
and all the other utensils that 
Greasy worked with. And there, 
half protruding out of the pile, 
was a little statuette of Greasy. 

I reached out a hand and 
picked up the statuette. There 
was no mistaking it — it was 
Greasy to a T. It was made of 
some sort of stone, as if it might 
have been a carving, and was 
delicate beyond all belief. Squint- 
ing closely, I could even see the 
lines on Greasy’s face. 

“The bag just went away,” said 
Knight. “It was lying here when 
we dashed out, and when we 
came back, it was gone and all 
this junk was lying on the table.” 

“I don’t understand,” Carr said. 

And he was right. None of us 
did. 

“I don’t like it,” Mack said 
slowly. 

I didn’t like it, either. It raised 
too many questions in my head 
and some of them were resolving 
into some miserable suspicions. 

“They’re making models of our 
stuff,” said Knight. “Even down 
to the cups and spoons.” 

“I wouldn’t mind that so 
much,” Carr said. “It’s the model 
of Greasy that gives me the 
jitters.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



f^TVr OW let’s sit down,” Mack 
' told us, “ and not go off 
on any tangents. This is exactly 
the sort of thing we could have 
expected.” 

“What do you mean?” I 
prompted. 

“What do we do when we find 
an alien culture? We do just what 
the Shadows are doing. Different 
way, but the same objective. We 
try to find out all we can about 
this alien culture. And don’t you 
ever forget that, to the Shadows, 
we’re not only an alien culture, 
but an invading alien culture. So 
if they had any sense at all, 
they’d make it their business to 
find out as much about us as they 
could in the shortest time.” 

That made sense, of course. 
But this making of models 
seemed to be carrying it beyond 
what was necessary. 

And if they had made models 
of Greasy’s cups and spoons, of 
the dishwasher and the coffee 
pot, then they had other models, 
too. They had models of the 
earthmovers and the shovels and 
the dozers and all the rest of it. 
And if they had a model of 
Greasy, they had models of Mack 
and Thorne and Carr and all the 
rest of the crew, including me. 

Just how faithful would those 
models be? How much deeper 
would they go than mere external 
appearances? 

I tried to stop thinking of it. 



for I was doing little more than 
scaring myself stiff. 

But I couldn’t stop. I went 
right on thinking. 

They had been gumming up 
equipment so that the mechanics 
had to rip the machines all 
apart to get them going once 
again. There seemed no reason 
in the world why the Shadows 
should be doing that, except to 
find out what the innards of 
those machines were like. I won- 
dered if the models of the equip- 
ment might not be faithful not 
only so far as the outward ap- 
pearance might go, but faithful 
as well on the most intricate con- 
struction of the entire machine. 

And if that was true, was that 
faithfulness also carried out in 
the Greasy statuette? Did it 
have a heart and lungs, blood 
vessels and brain and nerve? 
Might it not also have the very 
essence of Greasy’s character, the 
kind of animal he was, what his 
thoughts and ethics might be? 

I don’t know if, at that very 
moment, the others were thinking 
the same thing, but the looks on 
their faces argued that they 
might have been. 

Mack put out a finger and 
stirred the contents of the pile, 
scattering the miniatures all 
about the tabletop. 

Then his hand darted out and 
picked up something and his 
face went red with anger. 



SHADOW WORLD

Knight asked: “What is it, 
Mack?” 

“A peeper!” said Mack, his 
words rasping in his throat. 
“There’s a model of a peeper!” 

A ll of us sat and stared and 
I could feel the cold sweat 
breaking out on me. 

“If Greasy has a peeper,” Mack 
said woodenly, “I’ll break his 
scrawny neck.” 

“Take it easy. Mack,” said 
Carr. 

“You know what a peeper is?” 
“Sure, I know what a peeper 
is.” 

“You ever see what a peeper 
does to a man who used one?” 
“No, I never did.” 

“I have.” Mack threw the 
peeper model back on the table 
and turned and went out of the 
tent. The rest of us followed him. 

Greasy was coming down the 
street, with some of the men fol- 
lowing along behind, kidding him 
about the Shadow treeing him. 

Mack put his hands on his hips 
and waited. 

Greasy got almost to us. 
“Greasy!” said Mack. 

“Yes, Mack.” 

“You hiding out a peeper?” 
Greasy blinked, but he never 
hesitated. “No, sir,” he said, lying 
like a trooper. “I wouldn’t rightly 
know one if somebody should 
point it out to me. I’ve heard of 
them, of course.” 

“I’ll make a bargain with you,” 



said Mack. “If you have one, just 
hand it over to me and I’ll bust 
it up and fine you a full month’s 
wages and that’s the last that 
we’ll say about it. But if you lie 
to me and we find you have one 
hidden out. I’ll can you off the 
job.” 

I held my breath. I didn’t like 
what was going on and I thought 
what a lousy break it was that 
something like this should hap- 
pen just when I had swiped the 
peeper. Although I was fairly 
sure that no one had seen me 
sneak into the cookshack — at 
least I didn’t think they had. 

Greasy was stubborn. He 
shook his head. “I haven’t got 
one. Mack.” 

Mack’s face got hard. “All 
right. We’ll go down and see.” 

He headed for the cookshack 
and Knight and Carr went along 
with him, but I headed for my 
tent. 

It would be just like Mack, 
when he didn’t find the peeper in 
the cookshack, to search the en- 
tire camp. If I wanted to stay 
out of trouble, I knew, I’d better 
be zipping out of camp and take 
the peeper with me. 

t>ENNY was squatted outside 
the tent, waiting for me. He 
helped me get the roller out and 
then I took the specimen bag 
with the peeper in it and stuffed 
it in the roller’s carrying bag. 

I got on the roller and Benny 



124 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



jumped on the carrier behind me 
and sat there showing off, bal- 
ancing himself — like a kid riding 
a bicycle with no hands. 

“You hang on,” I told him 
sharply. “If you fall off this time, 
I won’t stop to pick you up.” 

I am sure he didn’t hear me, 
but however that may be, he put 
his arms around my waist and 
we were off in a cloud of dust. 

Until you’ve ridden on a roller, 
you haven’t really lived. It’s like 
a roller coaster running on the 
level. But it is fairly safe and it 
gets you there. It’s just two big 
rubber doughnuts with an engine 
and a seat and it could climb a 
barn if you gave it half a chance. 
It’s too rambunctious for civilized 
driving, but it is just the ticket 
for an alien planet. 

We set off across the plain 
toward the distant foothills. It 
was a fine day, but for that mat- 
ter, every day was fine on Stella 
IV. It was an ideal planet. Earth- 
like, with good weather nearly all 
the time, crammed with natural 
resources, free of vicious animal 
life or deadly virus — a planet 
that virtually pleaded for some- 
one to come and live on it. 

And in time there’d be people 
here. Once the administration 
center was erected, the neat rows 
of houses had been built, once the 
shopping center had been in- 
stalled, the dams built, the power 
plant completed — then there 
would be people. And in the 



years to come, sector by sector, 
project community by commu- 
nity, the human race would 
spread across the planet’s face. 
But it would spread in an orderly 
progression. 

Here there would be no ornery 
misfits slamming out on their 
own, willy-nilly, into the frontier 
land of wild dream and sudden 
death; no speculators, no strike- 
it-rich, no go-for-broke. Here 
there would be no frontier, but 
a systematic taking over. And 
here, for once, a planet would be 
treated right. 

But there was more to it than 
that, I told myself. 

If Man was to keep going into 
space, he would have to accept 
the responsibility of making 
proper use of the natural re- 
sources that he found there. Just” 
because there might be a lot of 
them was no excuse for wasting 
them. We were no longer children 
and we couldn’t gut every world 
as we had gutted Earth. 

By the time an intelligence ad- 
vances to a point where it can 
conquer space, it must have 
grown up. And now it was time 
for the human race to prove that 
it was adult. We couldn’t go 
ravaging out into the Galaxy like 
a horde of greedy children. 

Here on this planet, it seemed 
to me, was one of the many prov- 
ing grounds on which the race of 
Man must stand and show its 
worth. 



SHADOW WORLD 



125 



Y’ET if we were to get the job 
■*- done, if we were to prove any- 
thing at all, there was another 
problem that first must be met 
and solved. If it was the Shadows 
that were causing all our trouble, 
then somehow we must put a 
stop to it. And not merely put a 
stop to it, but understand the 
Shadows and their motives. For 
how can anybody fight a thing, 
I asked myself, that he doesn’t 
understand? 

And to understand the Shad- 
ows, we’d agreed back in the 
tent, we had to know what kind 
of critters they might be. And 
before we could find that out, 
we had to grab off one for exami- 
nation. And that first grab had 
to be perfect, for if we tried and 
failed, if we put them on their 
guard, there’d be no second 
chance. 

But the peeper, I told myself, 
might give us at least one free 
try. If I tried the peeper and it 
didn’t work, no one would be 
the wiser. It would be a failure 
that would go unnoticed. 

Benny and I crossed the plain 
on the roller and headed into the 
foothills. I made for a place that 
I called the Orchard, not because 
it was a formal orchard, but 
because there were a lot of fruit- 
bearing trees in the areas. As 
soon as I got around to it, I was 
planning to run tests to see if any 
of the fruit might be fit for 
human food. 

126 



We reached the Orchard and 
I parked the roller and looked 
around. I saw immediately that 
something had happened. When 
I had been there just a week or 
so before, the trees had been 
loaded with fruit and it seemed 
to be nearly ripe, but now it all 
was gone. 

I peered underneath the trees 
to see if the fruit had fallen off 
and it hadn’t. It looked for all 
the world as if someone had come 
in and picked it. 

I wondered if the Shadows 
had done the picking, but even 
as I thought it, I knew it couldn’t 
be. The Shadows didn’t eat. 

I didn’t get the peeper out 
right away, but sat down beneath 
a tree and sort of caught my 
breath and did a little thinking. 

From where I sat, I could see 
the camp and I wondered what 
Mack had done when he hadn’t 
found the peeper. I could imagine 
he’d be in a towering rage. And 
I could imagine Greasy, consid- 
erably relieved, but wondering 
just the same what had happened 
to the peeper and perhaps rub- 
bing it into Mack a little how he 
had been wrong. 

I got the feeling that maybe 
it would be just as well if I 
stayed away a while. At least 
until mid-afternoon. By that 
time, perhaps. Mack would have 
cooled off a little. 

And I thought about the 
Shadows. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Lousy savages, Thorne had 
said. Yet they were far from 
savages. They were perfect gen- 
tlemen (or ladies, God knows 
which they were, if either) and 
your genuine savage is no gentle- 
man on a number of very funda- 
mental points. The Shadows were 
clean in body, healthy and well- 
mannered. They had a certain 
cultural poise. They were, more 
than anything else, like a group 
of civilized campers, but unen- 
cumbered by the usual camp 
equipment. 

' I HEY were giving us a going- 
-*■ over — there could be no doubt 
of that. They were learning all 
they could of us and why did 
they want to know? What use 
could they make of pots and 
pans and earthmovers and all the 
other things? 

Or were they merely taking 
our measure before they clob- 
bered us? 

And there were all the other 
questions, too. 

Where did they hang out? 

How did they disappear, and 
when they disappeared, where did 
they go? 

How did they eat and breathe? 

How did they communicate? 

Come right down to it, I ad- 
mitted to myself, the Shadows 
undoubtedly knew a great deal 
more about us than we knew 
about them. Because when you 
tried to chalk up what we knew 



about them, it came out to almost 
exactly nothing. 

I sat under the tree for a while 
longer, with the thoughts spin- 
ning in my head and not adding 
up. Then I got to my feet and 
went over to the roller and got 
out the peeper. 

It was the first time I’d ever 
had one in my hands and I was 
interested and slightly apprehen- 
sive. For a peeper was nothing 
one should monkey with. 

It was a simple thing to look 
at — like a lopsided pair of bin- 
oculars, with a lot of selector 
knobs on each side and on the 
top of it. 

You looked into it and you 
twisted the knobs until you had 
what you wanted and then there 
was a picture. You stepped into 
the picture and you lived the 
life you found there — the sort 
of life you picked by the setting 
of the knobs. And there were 
many lives to pick from, for 
there were millions of combina- 
tions that could be set up on the 
knobs and the factors ranged 
from the lightest kind of frippery 
to the most abysmal horror. 

The peeper was outlawed, 
naturally — it was worse than 
alcoholism, worse than dope, the 
most insidious vice that had ever 
hit mankind. It threw psychic 
hooks deep into the soul and 
tugged forevermore. When a man 
acquired the habit, and it was 
easy to acquire, there was no get- 



SHADOW WORLD 



127 




ting over it. He’d spend the rest 
of his life trying to sort out his 
life from all the fantasied ones, 
getting further and further from 
reality all the while, till nothing 
was real any rnore. 

I squatted down beside the 
roller and tried to make some 
sense out of the knobs. There 
were thirty-nine of them, each 
numbered from one to thirty- 
nine, and I wondered what the 
numbering meant. 

Benny came over and hunk- 
ered down beside me, with one 
shoulder touching mine, and 
watched what I was doing. 

T PONDERED over the num- 
■*- bering, but pondering did no 
good. There was only one way to 
find out what I was looking for. 
So I set all the knobs back to 
zero on the graduated scales, 
then twisted No. 1 up a notch or 
two. 

I knew that was not the way to 
work a peeper. In actual opera- 
tion, one would set a number of 
the knobs at different settings, 
mixing in the factors in different 
proportions to make up the kind 
of life that one might want to 
sample. But I wasn’t after a life. 
What I wanted to find out was 
what factor each of the knobs 
controlled. 

So I set No. 1 up a notch or 
two and lifted the peeper and 
fitted it to my face and I was 

128 



back again in the meadow of my 
boyhood — a meadow that was 
green as no meadow ever was 
before, with a sky as blue as old- 
time watered silk and with a 
brook and butterflies. 

And more than that — a 
meadow that lay in a day that 
would never end, a place that 
knew no time, and a sunlight that 




was the bright glow of boyish 
happiness. 

I knew exactly how the grass 
would feel beneath bare feet and 
I could remember how the sun- 
light would bounce off the wind- 
ripples of the brook. It was the 
hardest thing I ever did in my 
entire life, but I snatched the 
peeper from my eyes. 



I squatted there, with the 
peeper cradled in my lap. My 
hands were unsteady, longing to 
lift the peeper so I could look 
once again at that scene out of 
a long-lost boyhood, but I made 
myself not do it. 

No. 1 was not the knob I 
wanted, so I turned it back to 
zero and, since No. 1 was about 



SHADOW WORLD 



129 



as far away as one could imagine 
from what I was looking for, I 
turned knob 39 up a notch or 
two. 

I lifted the peeper halfway to 
my face and then I turned plain 
scared. I put it down again until 
I could get a good grip on my 
courage. Then I lifted it once 
more and stuck my face straight 
into a horror that reached out 
and tried to drag me in. 

I can’t describe it. Even now, 
I cannot recall one isolated frag- 
ment of what I really saw. Rather 
than seeing, it was pure impres- 
sion and raw emotion — a sort of 
surrealistic representation of all 
that is loathsome and repellent, 
and yet somehow retaining a 
hypnotic fascination that forbade 
retreat. 

Shaken, I snatched the peeper 
from my face and sat frozen. For 
a moment, my mind was an utter 
blank, with stray wisp>s of hor- 
ror streaming through it. 

Then the wisps gradually 
cleared away and I was squatting 
once again on the hillside with 
the Shadow hunkered down 
beside me, his shoulder touching 
mine. 

It was a terrible thing, I 
thought, an act no human could 
bring himself to do, even to a 
Shadow. Just turned up a notch 
or two, it was terrifying; turned 
on full power, it would twist one’s 
brain. 

130 



B enny reached out a hand to 
take the peeper from me. 
I jerked it away from him. But 
he kept on pawing for it and that 
gave me time to think. 

This, I told myself, was exactly 
the way I had wanted it to be. 
All that was different was that 
Benny, by his nosiness, was mak- 
ing it easy for me to do the very 
thing I’d planned. 

I thought of all that depended 
on our getting us a Shadow to 
examine. And I thought about my 
job and how it would bust my 
heart if the inspector should 
come come out and fire us and 
send in another crew. There just 
weren’t planets lying around 
every day in the week to be 
engineered. I might never get 
another chance. 

So I put out my thumb and 
shoved knob 39 to its final notch 
and let Benny have the peeper. 

And even as I gave it to him, 
I wondered if it would really 
work or if I’d just had a pipe- 
dream. It might not work, I 
thought, for it was a human 
mechanism, designed for human 
use, keyed to the human nervous 
system and response. 

Then I knew that I was wrong, 
that the peeper did not operate 
by virtue of its machinery alone, 
but by the reaction of the brain 
and the body of its user — that 
it was no more than a trigger 
mechanism to set loose the great- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ness and the beauty and the hor- 
ror that lay within the user’s 
brain. And horror, while it might 
take a different shape and form, 
appear in a different guise, was 
horror for a Shadow as well as 
for a human. 

Benny lifted the peeper to that 
great single eye of his and thrust 
his head forward to fit into the 
viewer. Then I saw his body jerk 
and stiffen and I caught him as 
he toppled and eased him to the 
ground. 

I stood there above him and 
felt the triumph and the pride 
— and perhaps a little pity, too — 
that it should be necessary to 
do a thing like this to a guy like 
Benny. To play a trick like this 
on my Shadow who had sat, just 
moments ago, with his shoulder 
touching mine. 

I knelt down and turned him 
over. He didn’t seem so heavy 
and I was glad of that, because 
I’d have to get him on the roller 
and then make a dash for camp, 
going as fast as I could gun the 
roller, because there was no tell- 
ing how long Benny would stay 
knocked out. 

I picked up the peeper and 
stuck it back into the roller’s 
bag, then hunted for some rope or 
wire to tie Benny on so he would 
not fall off. 

I don’t know if I heard a noise 
or not. I’m half inclined to think 
that there wasn’t any noise — that 



it was some sort of built-in alarm 
system that made me turn 
around. 

Benny was sagging in upon 
himself and I had a moment of 
wild panic, thinking that he 
might be dead, that the shock of 
the horror that leaped out of the 
peeper at him had been too much 
for him to stand. 

And I remembered what Mack 
had said: “Never kill a thing 
until you have figured out just 
how efficiently it may up and 
kill you back.” 

If Benny was dead, then we 
might have all hell exploding in 
our laps. 

TF he was dead, though, he sure 
was acting funny. He was 
sinking in and splitting at a lot 
of different places, and he was 
turning to what looked like dust, 
but wasn’t dust, and then there 
wasn’t any Benny. There was just 
the harness with the bag and the 
jewel and then there wasn’t any 
bag, but a handful of trinkets ly- 
ing on the ground where the bag 
had been. 

And there was something else. 

There still was Benny’s eye. 
The eye was a part of a cone that 
had been in Benny’s head. 

I recalled how the survey party 
had seen other cones like that, 
but had not been able to get close 
to them. 

I was too scared to move. I 



SHADOW WORLD 



131 



stood and looked and there were 
a lot of goose pimples rising on 
my hide. 

For Benny was no alien. 
Benny was no more than the 
proxy of some other alien that 
we had never seen and could not 
even guess at. 

All sorts of conjectures went 
tumbling through my brain, but 
they were no more than panic- 
pictures, and they flipped off and 
on so fast, I couldn’t settle on 
any one of them. 

But one thing was clear as day 
— the cleverness of this alien for 
which the Shadows were the 
front. 

Too clever to confront us with 
anything that was more than 
remotely human in its shape — a 
thing for which we could feel pity 
or contempt or perhaps exaspera- 
tion, but something that would 
never rouse a fear within us. A 
pitiful little figure that was a 
caricature of our shape and one 
that was so stupid that it couldn’t 
even talk. And one that was suffi- 
ciently alien to keep us puzzled 
and stump us on so many basic 
points that we would, at last, 
give up in sheer bewilderment 
any attempts that we might make 
to get it puzzled out. 

I threw a quick glance over 
my shoulder and kept my shoul- 
ders hunched, and if anything 
had moved, I’d have run like a 
frightened rabbit. But nothing 

132 



moved. Nothing even rustled. 
There was nothing to be afraid 
of except the thoughts within my 
head. 

But I felt a frantic urge to get 
out of there and I went down on 
my hands and knees and began 
to gather what was left of Benny. 

I scooped up the pile of 
trinkets and the jewel and 
dumped them in the bag along 
with the peeper. Then I went 
back and picked up the cone, 
with the one eye looking at me, 
but I could see that the eye was 
dead. The cone was slippery and 
it didn’t feel like metal, but it 
was heavy and hard to get a good 
grip on and I had quite a time 
with it. But I finally got it in 
the bag and started out for camp. 

I went like a bat winging out 
of hell. Fear was roOsting on one 
shoulder and I kept that roller 
wheeling. 

T SWUNG into camp and 
headed for Mack’s tent, but 
before I got there, I found what 
looked like the entire project 
crew working at the craziest sort 
of contraption one would ever 
hope to see. It was a mass of 
gears and cams and wheels and 
chains and whatnot, and it 
sprawled over what, back home, 
would have been a good-sized 
lot, and there was no reason I 
could figure for building anything 
like that. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I saw Thorne standing off to 
one side and superintending the 
work, yelling first at this one and 
then at someone else, and I could 
see that he was enjoying himself. 
Thorne was that kind of bossy 
jerk. 

I stopped the roller beside him 
and balanced it with one leg. 

“What’s going on?” I asked 
him. 

“We’re giving them something 
to get doped out,” he said. “We’re 
going to drive them crazy.” 
“Them? You mean the 
Shadows?” 

“They want information, don’t 
they?” Thorne demanded. 
“They’ve been underfoot day and 
night, always in the way, so now 
we give them something to keep 
them occupied.” 

“But what does it do?” 

Thorne spat derisively. “Noth- 
ing. That’s the beauty of it.” 
“Well,” I said, “I suppose you 
know what you’re doing. Does 
Mack know what’s going on?” 
“Mack and Carr and Knight 
are the big brains that thought 
it up,” said Thorne. “I’m just car- 
rying out orders.” 

I went on to Mack’s tent and 
parked the roller there and I 
knew that Mack was inside, for I 
heard a lot of arguing. 

I took the carrier bag and 
marched inside the tent and 
pushed my way up to the table 
and, up-ending the sack, emptied 



the whole thing on the tabletop. 

And I plumb forgot about the 
peeper being in there with all the 
other stuff. 

There was nothing I could do 
about it. The peeper lay naked 
on the table and there was a ter- 
rible silence and I could see that 
in another second Mack would 
blow his jets. 

He sucked in his breath to 
roar, but I beat him to it. 

“Shut up. Mack!” I snapped. 
“I don’t want to hear a word from 
you!” 

I must have caught him by 
surprise, for he let his breath 
out slowly, looking at me funny 
while he did it, and Carr and 
Knight were just slightly frozen 
in position. The tent was deathly 
quiet. 

“That was Benny,” *I said, 
motioning at the tabletop. “That 
is all that’s left of him. A look 
in the peeper did it.” 

^ ARR came a bit unfrozen. 

“But the peeper! We looked 
everywhere — ” 

“I knew Greasy had it and I 
stole it when I got a hunch.” 
“Remember, we were talking 
about how to catch a Shadow—” 

“I’m going to bring charges 
against you!” howled Mack. “I’m 
going to make an example out of 
you! I’m going to — ” 

“You’re going to shut up,” I 
said at him. “You’re going to stay 



SHADOW WORLD 



133 



quiet and listen or I’ll heave you 
out of here tin cup over appetite.” 

“Please!” begged Knight. 
“Please, gentlemen, let’s act civi- 
lized.” 

And that was a hot one — him 
calling us gentlemen. 

“It seems to me,” said Carr, 
“that the matter of the peeper is 
somewhat immaterial if Bob has 
turned it to some useful purpose.” 

“Let’s all sit down,” Knight 
urged, “and maybe count to ten. 
Then Bob can tell us what is on 
his mind.” 

It was a good suggestion. We 
all sat down and I told them 
what had happened. They sat 
there listening, looking at all that 
junk on the table and especially 
at the cone, for it was lying on its 
side at one end of the table, 
where it had rolled, and it was 
looking at us with that dead and 
fishy eye. 

“Those Shadows,” I finished 
up, “aren’t alive at all. They’re 
just some sort of spy rig that 
something else is sending out. All 
we need to do is lure the Shadows 
off, one by one, and let them look 
into the peeper with knob 39 set 
full and — ” 

“It’s no permanent solution,” 
said Knight. “Fast as we de- 
stroyed them, there’d be other 
ones sent out.” 

I shook my head. “I don’t think 
so. No matter how good that 
alien race may be, they can’t 



control those Shadows just by 
mental contact. My bet is that 
there are machines involved, and 
when we destroy a Shadow, it 
would be my hunch that we 
knock out a machine. And if 
we knock out enough of them, 
we’ll give those other people so 
much headache that they may 
come out in the open and we can 
dicker with them.” 

“I’m afraid you’re wrong,” 
Knight answered. “This other 
race keeps hidden, I’d say, for 
some compelling reason. Maybe 
they have developed an under- 
ground civilization and never 
venture on the surface bcause 
it’s a hostile environment to them. 
But maybe they keep track of 
what is doing on the surface by 
means of these cones of theirs. 
And when we showed up, they 
rigged the cones to look like 
something slightly human, some- 
thing they felt sure we would 
accept, and sent them out to get 
a good close look.” 

11/rACK put up his hands and 
rubbed them back and forth 
across his head. “I don’t like this 
hiding business. I like things out 
in the open where I can take a 
swipe at them and they can take 
a swipe at me. I’d have liked it 
a whole lot better if the Shadows 
had really been the aliens.” 

“I don’t go for your under- 
ground race,” Carr said to Knight.

“It doesn’t seem to me you could 
produce such a civilization if you 
lived underground. You’d be 
shut away from all the phenom- 
ena of nature. You wouldn’t — ” 

“All right,” snapped Knight, 
“what’s youT idea?” 

“They might have matter 
transmission — in fact, we know 
they do — whether by machine 
or mind, and that would mean 
that they’d never have to travel 
on the surface of the planet, but 
could transfer from place to place 
in the matter of a second. But 
they still would need to know 
what was going on, so they’d have 
their eyes and ears like a TV 
radar system — ” 

“You jokers are just talking 
round in circles,” objected Mack. 
“You don’t know what the score 
is.” 

“I supjKJse you do,” Knight 
retorted. 

“No, I don’t,” said Mack. “But 
I’m honest enough to say straight 
out I don’t.” 

“I think Carr and Knight are 
too involved,” I said. “These 
aliens might be hiding only until 
they find out what we’re like — 
whether they can trust us or if it 
would be better to run us off 
the planet.” 

“Well,” said Knight, “no mat- 
ter how you figure it, you’ve got 
to admit that they probably 
know practically all there is to 
know about us — our technology 



and our purpose and what kind 
of animals we are and they 
probably have picked up our lan- 
guage.” 

“They know too much,” said 
Mack. “I’m getting scared.” 

There was a scrabbling at the 
flap and Thorne stuck in his 
head. 

“Say, Mack,” he said, “I got a 
good idea. How about setting up 
some guns in that contraption out 
there? When the Shadows crowd 
around — ” 

“No guns,” Knight said firmly. 
“No rockets. No electrical traps. 
You do just what we told you. 
Produce all the useless motion 
you can. Get it as involved and 
as flashy as possible. But let it 
go at that.” 

Thorne withdrew sulkily. 

1^ NIGHT explained to me: 
iV don’t expect it to last 
too long, but it may keep them 
occupied for a week or so while 
we get some work done. When 
it begins to wear off, we’ll fix up 
something else.” 

It was all right, I suppose, but 
it didn’t sound too hot to me. At 
the best, it bought a little time 
and nothing more. It bought a 
little time, that is, if we could 
fool the Shadows. Somehow, I 
wasn’t sure that we could fool 
them much. Ten to one, they’d 
spot the contraption as a phony 
the minute it was set in motion.

Mack got up and walked 
around the table. He lifted the 
cone and tucked it beneath one 
arm. 

“I’ll take this down to the shop,” 
he said. “Maybe the boys can 
find out what it is.” 

“I can tell you now,” said Carr. 
“It’s what the aliens use to con- 
trol the Shadows. Remember the 
cones the survey people saw? 
This is one of them. My guess is 
that it’s some kind of a signal 
device that can transmit data 
back to base, wherever that might 
be.” 

“No matter,” Mack said. 
“We’ll cut into it and see what 
we can find.” 

“And the peeper?” I asked. 

“I’ll take care of that.” 

I reached out a hand and 
picked it up. “No, you won’t. 
You’re just the kind of bigot who 
would take it out and smash it.” 
“It’s illegal,” Mack declared. 
Carr sided with me. “Not any 
more. It’s a tool now — a weapon 
that we can use.” 

I handed it to Carr. “You take 
care of it. Put it in a good safe 
place. We may need it again 
before all this is over.” 

I gathered the junk that had 
been in Benny’s bag and picked 
up the jewel and dropped it into 
a pocket of my coat. 

Mack went out with the cone 
underneath his arm. The rest of 
us drifted outside the tent and 

136 



stood there, just a little footloose 
now that the excitement was all 
over. 

“He’ll have Greasy’s hide,” 
worried Knight. 

“I’ll talk to him,” Carr said. 
“I’ll make him see that Greasy 
may have done us a service by 
sneaking the thing out here.” 

“I suppose,” I said, “I should 
tell Greasy what happened to 
the peeper.” 

Knight shook his head. “Let 
him sweat a while. It will do him 
good.” 

T>ACK in my tent, I tried to 
do some paper work, but 
I couldn’t get my mind to settle 
down on it. I guess I was excited 
and I’m afraid that I missed 
Benny and I was tangled up with 
wondering just what the situation 
was, so far as the Shadows were 
concerned. 

We had named them well, all 
right, for they were little more 
than shadows — meant to shadow 
us. But even knowing they were 
just camouflaged spy rigs, I still 
found it hard not to think of 
them as something that was alive. 

They were no more than cones, 
of course, and the cones probably 
were no more than observation 
units for those hidden people who 
hung out somewhere on the 
planet. For thousands of years, 
perhaps, the cones had been 
watching while this race stayed 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



in hiding somewhere. But maybe 
more than watching. Maybe the 
cones were harvesters and plant- 
ers — perhaps hunters and trap- 
pers — bringing back the plunder 
of the wilds to their hidden 
masters. More than likely, it had 
been the cones that had picked 
all the Orchard fruit. 

And if there was a culture here, 
if another race had primal rights 
upon the planet, then what did 
that do to the claims that Earth 
might make? Did it mean we 
might be forced to relinquish this 
planet, after all — one of the few 
Earthlike planets found in years 
of exploration? 

I sat at my desk and thought 
about the planning and the work 
and the money that had gone 
into this project, which, even so, 
was no more than a driblet com- 
pared to what eventually would 
be spent to make this into 
another Earth. 

Even on this project center, 
we’d made no more than an 
initial start. In a few more weeks, 
the ships would begin bringing 
in the steel mill and that in itself 
was a tremendous task — to bring 
it in, assemble it, mine the ore 
to get it going and finally to put 
it into operation. But simpler and 
easier, infinitely so, than freight- 
ing out from Earth all the steel 
that would be needed to build 
this project alone. 

We couldn’t let it go down the 
drain. After all the years, after 



all the planning and the work, in 
face of Earth’s great need for 
more living space, we could not 
give up Stella IV. And yet we 
could not deny primal rights. If 
these beings, when they finally 
showed themselves, would say 
that they didn’t want us here, 
then there would be no choice. 
We would simply have to clear 
out. 

But before they threw us out, 
of course, they would steal us 
blind. Much of what we had 
would undoubtedly be of little 
value to them, but there would be 
some of it that they could use. 
No race can fail to enrich itself 
and its culture by contact with 
another. And the contact that 
these aliens had established was 
a completely one-sided bargain — 
the exchange flowed only in their 
direction. 

They were, I told myself, just 
a bunch of cosmic sharpers. 

T TOOK the junk that had been 
in Benny’s bag out of my 
pocket and spread it on the desk 
and began to sort it out. There 
was the sector model and the 
roller and the desk and my little 
row of books and the pocket 
chess set and all the other stuff 
that belonged to me. 

There was all the stuff but me. 

Greasy’s Shadow had carried a 
statuette of Greasy, but I found 
none of me and I was a little sore 
at Benny. He could have gone to 



SHADOW WORLD 



137 



the extra effort to have made a 
statuette of me. 

I rolled the things around on 
the desk top with a finger and 
wondered once again just how 
deeply they went. Might they 
not be patterns rather than just 
models? Perhaps, I told myself, 
letting my imagination run away 
with me, perhaps each of these 
little models carried in some sort 
of code a complete analysis and 
description of whatever the ar- 
ticle might be. A human, making 
a survey or an analysis, would 
write a sheaf of notes, would 
capture the subject matter in a 
page or two of .symbols. Maybe 
these little models were the 
equivalent of a human notebook, 
the aliens’ way of writing. 

And I wondered how they wrote, 
how they made the models, but 
there wasn’t any answer. 

I gave up trying to work and 
went out of the tent and climbed 
up the little rise to where Thorne 
and the men were building their 
flytrap for the Shadows. 

They had put a lot of work and 
ingenuity into it and it made no 
sense at all — which, after all, was 
exactly what it was meant to do. 

If we could get the Shadows 
busy enough trying to figure out 
what this new contraption was, 
maybe they’d leave us alone long 
enough to get some work done. 

Thorne and his crew had gotten 
half a doien replacement motors 



out of the shop and had installed 
those to be used as power. Appar- 
ently they had used almost all the 
spare equipment parts they could 
find, for there were shafts and 
gears and cams and all sorts of 
other things all linked together 
in a mindless pattern. And here 
and there they had set up what 
looked like control boards, except, 
of course, that they controlled ab- 
solutely nothing, but were jammed 
with flashers and all sorts of other 
gimmicks until they looked like 
Christmas trees. 

I stood around and watched 
until Greasy rang the dinner bell, 
then ran a foot race with all the 
others to get to the tables. 

There was a lot of loud talk and 
joking, but no one wasted too much 
time eating. They bolted their 
food and hurried back to the fly- 
trap. 

J UST before sunset, they set it 
going and it was the screwiest 
mass of meaningless motion that 
anyone had ever seen. Shafts were 
spinning madly and a million 
gears, it seemed, were meshing, 
and cams were wobbling with 
their smooth, irregular strokes, 
and pistons were going up and 
down and up and down. 

It was all polished bright and 
it worked slicker than a whistle 
and it was producing nothing ex- 
cept motion, but it had a lot of 
fascination — even for a human. I 



T38 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



found myself standing rooted in 
one spot, marveling at the smooth- 
ness and precision and the re- 
morseless non-purpose of the weird 
contraption. 

And all the time the fake con- 
trol boards were sparkling and 
flashing with the lamps popping 
on and off, in little jagged runs 
and series, and you got dizzy 
watching them, trying to make 
some pattern out of them. 

The Shadows had been stand- 
ing around and gaping ever since 
work had started on the trap, but 
now they crowded closer and stood 
in a tight and solemn ring around 
the thing and they never moved. 

I turned around and Mack was 
just behind me. He was rubbing 
his hands in satisfaction and his 
face was all lit up with smiles. 

“Pretty slick,” he said. 

I agreed with him, but I had 
some doubts that I could not quite 
express. 

“We’ll string up some lights,” 
said Mack, “so they can see it day 
and night and then we’ll have them 
pegged for good.” 

“You think they’ll stay with it?” 
I asked. “They won’t catch on?” 

“Not a chance.” 

I went down to my tent and 
poured myself a good stiff drink, 
then sat down in a chair in front 
of the tent. 

Some of the men were stringing 
cable and others were rigging up 
some batteries of lights and down 



in the cookshack I could hear 
Greasy singing, but the song was 
sad. I felt sorry for Greasy. 

Mack might be right, I admitted 
to myself. We might have built 
a trap that would cook the Shad- 
ows’ goose. If nothing else, the 
sheer fascination of all that mo- 
tion might keep them stuck there. 
It had a hypnotic effect even for a 
human and one could never gauge 
what effect it might have on an 
alien mind. Despite the evident 
technology of the aliens, it was en- 
tirely possible that their machine 
technology might have developed 
along some divergent line, so that 
the spinning wheel and the plung- 
ing piston and the smooth fluid 
gleam of metal was new to them. 

I tried to imagine a machine 
technology that would require no 
motion, but such a thing was en- 
tirely inconceivable to me. And 
for that very reason, I thought, 
the idea of all this motion might 
be just as inconceivable to an alien 
intellect. 

stars came out while I sat 
there and no one wandered 
over to gab and that was fine. I 
was just as satisfied to be left 
alone. 

After a time, I went into the 
tent, had another drink and de- 
cided to go to bed. 

I took off my coat and slung it 
on the desk. When it hit, there was 
a thump, and as soon as I heard 



SHADOW WORLD 



139 



that thump, I knew what it was. I 
had dropped Benny’s jewel into 
the pocket of the coat and had 
then forgotten it. 

I fished into the pocket and got 
out the jewel, fearing all the while 
that I had broken it. And there 
was something wrong with it — it 
had somehow come apart. The 
jewel face had come loose from 
the rest of it and I saw that the 
jewel was no more than a cover 
for a box-shaped receptacle. 

I put it on the desk and swung 
the jewel face open and there, in-’ 
side the receptacle, I found my- 
self. 

The statuette was nestled inside 
a weird piece of mechanism and 
it was as fine a piece of work as 
Greasy’s statuette. 

It give me a flush of pride and 
satisfaction. Benny, after all, had 
not forgotten me! 

I sat for a long time looking at 
the statuette, trying to puzzle out 
the mechanism. I had a good 
look at the jewel and I finally 
figured out what it was all about. 

The jewel was no jewel at all; 
it was a camera. Except that in- 
stead of taking two-dimensional 
pictures, it worked in three di- 
mensions. And that, of course, 
was how the Shadows made the 
models. Or maybe they were pat- 
terns rather than just models. 

I finished undressing and got 
into bed and lay on the cot, staring 
at the canvas, and the pieces all

began to fall together and it was 
beautiful. Beautiful, that is, for 
the aliens. It made us look like a 
bunch of sap>s. 

The cones had gone out and 
watched the survey party and had 
not let it get close to them, but 
they had been ready for us when 
we came. They’d disguised the 
cones to look like something that 
we wouldn’t be afraid of, some- 
thing perhaps that we could even 
laugh at it. And that was the saf- 
est kind of disguise that anyone 
could assume — something that 
the victim might think was mildly 
funny. For no one gets too upset 
about what a clown might do. 

But the Shadows had been 
loaded and they’d let us have it 
and apparently, by the time we 
woke up, they had us pegged and 
labeled. 

And what would they do now? 
Still stay behind their log, still 
keep watching us, suck us dry of 
everything that we had to offer? 

And when they were ready, 
when they’d gotten all they wanted 
or all they felt that they could 
get, they’d come out and finish us. 

I was somewhat scared and an- 
gry and felt considerably like a 
fool and it was frustrating just to 
think about. 

IVT ACK might kid himself that 
he had solved the problem 
with his flytrap out there, but there 
was still a job to do. Somehow or

other, we had to track down these 
hiding aliens and break up their 
little game. 

Somewhere along the way, I 
went to sleep, and suddenly some- 
one was shaking me and yelling 
for me to get out. 

I came half upright and saw that 
it was Carr who had been shaking 
me. He was practically gibbering. 
He kept pointing outside and 
babbling something about a funny 
cloud and I couldn’t get much 
more out of him. 

So I shucked into my trousers 
and my shoes and went out with 
him and headed for the hilltop at 
a run. Dawn was just breaking and 
the Shadows still were clustered 
around the flytrap and a crowd of 
men had gathered just beyond the 
flytrap and were looking toward 
the east. 

We pushed our way through the 
crowd up to the front and there 
was the cloud that Carr had been 
jabbering about, but it was a good 
deal closer now and was sailing 
across the plains, slowly and ma- 
jestically, and flying above it was 
a little silver sphere that flashed 
and glittered in the first rays of 
the sun. 

The cloud looked, more than 
anything, like a mass of junk. I 
could see what looked like a der- 
rick sticking out of it and here 
and there what seemed to be a 
wheel. I tried to figure out what it 
might be, but I couldn’t, and all 



the time it was moving closer to 
us. 

Mack was at my left and I spoke 
to him, but he didn’t answer me. 
He was just like Benny — he 
couldn’t answer me. He looked 
hypnotized. 

The closer that cloud came, the 
more fantastic it was and the more 
unbelievable. For there was no 
question now that it was a mass of 
machinery, just like the equipment 
we had. There were tractors and 
earthmovers and shovels and 
dozers and all the other stuff, and 
in between these bigger pieces was 
all sorts of little stuff. 

In another five minutes, it was 
hovering almost over us and then 
slowly it began to lower. While we 
watched, it came down to the 
ground, gently, almost without a 
bump, even though there were a 
couple or three acres of it. Besides 
the big equipment, there were 
tents and cups and spoons and 
tables and chairs and benches and 
a case or two of whisky and some 
surveying equipment — there was, 
it seemed to me, almost exactly all 
the items there were in the camp. 

When it had all sat down, the 
little silver sphere came down, too, 
and floated slowly toward us. It 
stopped a little way away from us 
and Mack walked out toward it 
and I followed Mack. Out of the 
corner of my eye, I saw that Carr 
and Knight were walking forward, 
too. 



142 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Y¥7E STOPPED four or five feet 
^ ’ from it and now we saw that 
the sphere was some sort of pro- 
tective suit. Inside it sat a pale 
little humanoid. Not human, but 
at least with two legs and arms and 
a single head. He had antennae 
sprouting from his forehead and 
his ears were long and pointed and 
he had no hair at all. 

He let the sphere set down on 
the ground and we got a little 
closer and squatted down so we 
would be on a level with him. 

He jerked a thumb backward 
over his shoulder, pointing at the 
mass of equipment he’d brought. 

“Is pay,” he announed in a shrill, 
high, piping voice. 

We didn’t answer right away. 
We did some gulping first. 

“Is pay for wliat?” Knight finally 
managed to ask him. 

“For fun,” the creature said. 

“I don’t understand,” said Mack. 

“We make one of everything. 
We not know wliat you want, so 
we make one of all. Unfortunate, 
two lots are missing. Accident, per- 
haps.” 

“The models,” I said to the 
others. “That’s what he’s talking 
about. The models were patterns 
and the models from Greasy’s 
Shadow and from Benny — ” 

“Not all,” the creature said. 
“The rest be right along.” 

“Now wait a minute,” said Carr. 
‘Let us get this straight. You are 
pftying us. Paying us for what? 



Exactly what did we do for you?” 

Mack blurted out: “How did 
you make this stuff?” 

“One question at a time,” I 
pleaded. 

“Machines can make,” the crea- 
ture said. “Knowing how, machines 
can make anything. Very good ma- 
chines.” 

“But why?” asked Carr again. 
“Why did you make it for us?” 

“For fun,” the creature ex- 
plained patiently. “For laugh. For 
watch. Is a big word I cannot—” 

“Entertainment?” I offered. 

“That is right,” the creature 
said. “Entertainment is the word. 
We have lot of time for entertain- 
ment. We stay home, watch our 
entertainment screen. We get tired 
of it. We seek for something new. 
You something new. Give us much 
interesting. We try to pay you for 
it.” 

“Good Lord!” exclaimed Knight. 
“I begin to get it now. We were a 
big news event and so they sent 
out all those cones to cover us. 
Mack, did you saw into that cone 
last night?” 

“We did,” said Mack. “As near 
as we could figure, it was a TV 
sender. Not like ours, of course — 
there would be differences. But we 
figured it for a data-sending rig.” 

T TURNED back to the alien in 
his shiny sphere. “Listen care- 
fully,” I said. “Let’s get down to 
business. You are willing to keep 



SHADOW WORLD 



143 



on paying if we provide you en- 
tertainment?” 

“Gladly,” said the creature. 
“You keep us entertained, we give 
you what you want.” 

“Instead of one of everything, 
you will make us many of one 
thing?” 

“You show it to us,” the creature 
said. “You let us know how many.” 
“Steel?” asked Mack. “You can 
make us steel?” 

“No recognize this steel. Show 
us. How made, how big, how 
shaped. We make.” 

“If we keep you entertained?” 
“That right,” the creature said. 
“Deal?” I asked. 

“Deal,” the creature said. 
“From now on? No stopping?” 
“Long as you keep us happy.” 
“That may take some doing,” 
Mack told me. 

“No, it won’t,” I said. 

“You’re crazy!” Mack yelped. 
“They’ll never let us have them!” 
“Yes, they will,” I answered. 
“Earth will do anything to cinch 
this planet. And don’t you see, with 
this sort of swap, we’ll beat the 
cost. All Earth has to do is send 
out one sample of everything we 
need. One sample will do the trick. 
One I-beam and they’ll make a 
million of them. It’s the best deal 
Earth has ever made.” 

“We do our part,” the creature 
assured us happily. “Long as you 
do yours.” 

144 



“I’ll get that order right off now,” 
I said to Mack. “I’ll write it up 
and have Jack send it out.” 

T STOOD up and headed back 
toward camp. 

“Rest of it,” the creature said, 
motioning over his shoulder. 

I swung around and looked. 

There was another mass of stuff 
coming in, keeping fairly low. And 
this time it was men — a solid press 
of men. 

“Hey!” cried Mack. “You can’t 
do that! That just isn’t right!” 

I didn’t need to look. I knew ex- 
actly what had happened. The 
aliens had duplicated not only our 
equipment, but the men as well. In 
that crowd of men were the dupli- 
cates of every one of us — every- 
one, that is, except myself and 
Greasy. 

Horrified as I might have been, 
outraged as any human would be, 
I couldn’t help but think of some 
of the situations that might arise. 
Imagine two Macks insisting on 
bossing the operation! Picture two 
Thornes trying to get along to- 
gether! 

I didn’t hang around. I left 
Mack and the rest of them to ex- 
plain why men should not be 
duplicated. In my tent, I sat down 
and wrote an imperative, high- 
priority, must-deliver order for 
five hundred peepers.
