CAREER OFFERED 



A GOOD many writers who 
have broken into Galaxy 
have tried to tell me how it feels. 
They couldn’t, because the words 
haven’t yet been invented. But 
there was no need to try — it was 
just twenty years ago, exactly 
half my lifetime, that I sold my 
first story and I well remember 
my dazzled feeling that a miracle 
had been passed. 

As a matter of fact, I can’t 
think of anything about that first 
sale that wasn’t miraculous. Jobs 
in 1934 were desperately scarce; 
I hunted by day and wrote by 
night. Every door had a “No 
Help Wanted” sign and my 
manuscripts seemed to be opened 
by a machine that slipped them 
unread, along with a rejection 
slip, into the return envelope. 
Where did magazines get their 
material? More machines, obvi- 
ously. 

I had found a job as busboy. 
The hours were from 10 a.m. to 
4 A.M. Then I had to walk sev- 
eral miles home because the buses 
didn’t run that late at night. 
When I came back the next morn- 
ing, I was laid off with an as- 
tonishing explanation. 

The boss, an artistic type, 
couldn’t stand the sight of a 
writer collecting dirty dishes! 

I argued baffiedly that I had 



never sold anything and so was 
not yet a writer, that I was gain- 
ing experience in life’s hard real- 
ities for later use — and, in any 
case, he wasn’t paying me; the 
waiters were! 

He agreed sorrowfully that I 
was right on all counts. But he 
still couldn’t bear the sight of 
even a future writer stacking 
dishes. 

The morning mail had come 
when I got back home, furious 
and worried. There was a busi- 
ness envelope instead of a manu- 
script in the box. I had sold my 
first story! 

Do you think anybody has to 
tell me how that feels? 

Do you think anybody could? 

There’s more of a point to this 
than mere reminiscence, of course 
— the short-story contest we are 
running in cooperation with the 
American Humanist Association, 
for at least one college student, 
and I hope many more, will feel 
the same touch of the wand — 
and the rest of us will share that 
triumph in the enjoyment of 
reading work by fresh, vigorous 
new talent. 

Here is a pertinent heartfelt 
quote from my introduction to 
the First Galaxy Reader of Sci- 
ence Fiction: 

“Were I an envious man, which 



4 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I am, I would resent the break 
that authors have today in rates 
and markets. There were very 
few science fiction magazines (in 
the 1930s), their rates ranging 
from microscopic fractions of a 
cent payable upon lawsuit to just 
enough to starve on . 

“Crashing Galaxv is no cinch, 
as (its) stories, with their fine 
ideas, sharp characterization and 
shrewd craftsmanship, more than 
adequately prove. 

“No doubt there is a lesson to 
be derived from this. Writing sci- 
ence fiction in the early days was 
easier, but the pay was poor. 
Writing for Galaxy is much 
harder, but the pay is highly re- 
warding both in amount and pres- 
tige. 

“I guess it balances out. Either 
way, writing — especially the 
writing of science fiction — is not 
a job for the lazy. A good story, 
such as you’ll find here, gives the 
illusion of having been produced 
effortlessly. Nothing involves 
more effort than achieving that 
illusion, however.” 

In other words, don’t kid your- 
self that writing is a substitute 
for work. It requires as hard an 
apprenticeship as any other pro- 
fession. But there is this differ- 
ence — no other profession has 
as low a starting age. I was 
twenty when I began to sell, but 
many broke in at seventeen and 
eighteen . and one girl was 



fourteen when she started a very 
successful series! 

Naturally, few of us sold our 
very first story. And I’d like to 
say that, when the maiden sale 
was made, we all lived happily 
ever after. But each found there 
was still plenty to be learned 
about the selection and develop- 
ment of theme, characterization 
and incident. And we’re all still 
capable of turning out occasional 
duds. 

If I’m forced to state the most 
important ingredient, I am afraid 
I have to contradict Somerset 
Maugham. He, you remember, 
urged a friend to write and was 
told, “But I don’t have any 
ideas.” Maugham said, “That is 
the weakest excuse for not writ- 
ing I have ever heard!” 

The essence of science fiction is 
ideas. If you’re thinking in terms 
of atomic or cosmic warfare or 
matriarchies or chlorophyll pro- 
ducts turning people into plants, 
stop and start over — ^these and 
other such obvious themes have 
been worked to death. You need 
a bright, fresh idea. Then you 
have to know what to do with 
it dramatically. 

To get back to an earlier point 
— no, magazines don’t have auto- 
matic remailing or story-writing 
machines! 

I just thought you might be 
wondering.

A Thief in Time 



By ROBERT SHECKLEY 



Wdnf to foretell the future? It's easy— oil 
you have to do Is convert it into the past! 

T homas Eldndge was 
all alone in his room in 
Butler Hall when he heard 
the faint scraping noise behind 
him. It barely registered on his 
consciousness. He was studying 
the Holstead equations, which 
had caused such a stir a few years 
ago, with their hint of a non-

Relativity universe. They were 
a disturbing set of symbols, even 
though their conclusions had 
been proved quite fallacious. 

Still, if one examined them 
without preconceptions, they 
seemed to prove ^mething. 
There was a strange relationship 
of temporal elements, with inter- 
esting force-applications. There 
was — he heard the noise again 
and turned his head. 

Standing in back of him was 
a large man dressed in balloon- 
ing purple trousers, a little green 
vest and a porous silver shirt. 
He was carrying a square black 
machine with several dials and 
he looked decidedly unfriendly. 

They stared at each other. 
For a moment, Eldridge thought 
it was a fraternity prank. He 
was the youngest associate pro- 
fessor at Carvell Tech, and some 
student was always handing him 
a hard-boiled egg or a live toad 
during Hell Week. 

But this man was no giggling 
student. He was at least fifty 
years old and unmistakably hos- 
tile. 

“How’d you get in here?” Eld- 
ridge demanded. ^‘And what do 
you want?” 

r^HE man raised an eyebrow. 

* “Going to brazen it out, eh?” 

“Brazen what out?” Eldridge 
asked, startled. 

“This is Viglin you’re talking 



to,” the man said. Re- 

member?” 

Eldridge tried to remember 
if there were any insane asy- 
lums near Carvell. This Viglin 
looked like an escaped lunatic. 

“You must have the wrong 
man,” Eldridge said, wondering 
if he should call for help. 

Viglin shook his head. “You 
are Thomas Monroe Eldridge,” 
he said. “Bom March 16, 1926, 
in Darien, Connecticut. Attend- 
ed the University Heights Col- 
lege, New York University, 
graduating cum laude. Received 
a fellowship to Carvell last year, 
in early 1953. Correct so far?” 

“All right, so you did a little 
research on me for some reason. 
It better be a good one or 1 call 
the cops.” 

“You always were a cool cus- 
tomer. But the bluff won’t work. 
/ will call the police.” 

He pressed a button on the 
machine. Instantly, two men ap- 
peared in the room. They wore 
light-weight orange and green 
uniforms, with metallic insignia 
on the sleeves. Between them 
they carried a black machine 
similar to Viglin’s except that 
it had white stenciling on its 
top. 

“Crime does not pay,” Viglin 
said. “Arrest that thief!” 

For a moment, Eldridge’s 
pleasant college room, with its 
Gauguin prints, its untidy piles

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



of books, its untidier hi-fi, and 
its shaggy little red rug. seemed 
to spin dizzily around him. He 
blinked several times, hoping 
that the whole thing had been 
induced by eyestrain. Or better 
yet. perhaps he had been dream- 
ing. 

But Viglin was still there, dis- 
mayingly substantial. 

The two policemen produced 
a pair of handcuffs and walked 
forward. 

“Wait!” Eldridge shouted, 
leaning against his desk for sup- 
port. “What’s this all about?” 

“If you insist on formal charg- 
es.” Viglin said, “you shall have 
them.” He cleared his .throat. 
“Thomas Eldridge, in March, 
1962, you invented the Eldridge 
Traveler. Then — ” 

“Hold on!" Eldridge protested. 
"It isn’t 1962 yet, in case you 
didn’t know.” 

Viglin looked annoyed. “Don’t 
quibble. You will invent the 
Traveler in 1962, if you prefer 
that phrasing. It’s all a matter 
of temporal viewpoint.” 

It took Eldridge a moment to 
digest this. 

Then it struck him. 

“Do you mean — ^you. are from 
the future?” he blurted. 

O NE of the policemen nudged 
the other. “What an act!” 
he said admiringly. 

“Better than a groogly show," 



the other agreed, clicking his 
handcuffs. 

“Of course we’re from the 
future,” Viglin said. “Where else 
would we be from? In 1962, you 
did— or will — invent the Eld- 
ridge Time Traveler, thus mak- 
ing time travel possible. With 
it, you journeyed into the first 
sector of the future, where you 
were received with highest hon- 
ors. Then you traveled through 
the three sectors of Civilized 
Time, lecturing. You were a 
hero, Eldridge, an ideal. Little 
children wanted to grow up to 
be like you.” 

With a husky voice, Viglin 
continued. “We were deceived. 
Suddenly and deliberately, you 
stole a quantity of valuable 
goods. It was shocking! We had 
never suspected you of criminal 
tendencies. When we tried to 
arrest you, you vanished.” 

Viglin paused and rubbed his 
forehead wearily. “I was your 
friend, Tom, the first person you 
met in Sector One. We dratik 
many a bowl of flox together. 
I arranged your lecture tour. 
And you robbed me.” 

His face hardened. “Take him, 
officers.” 

As the policemen moved for- 
ward, Eldridge had a good look 
at the black machine they shar- 
ed. Like Viglin’s, it had several 
dials and a row of push buttons. 
Stamped in white across the top

were the words: eldridoe time 

TRAVELER — PROPERTY OF THE EAS- 
KILL POLICE DEPT. 

The policeman stopped and 
turned to Viglin. “You got the 
extradition papers?” 

Viglin searched his pockets. 
“Don’t seem to have them on 
ine. But you know he’s a thief!” 
“Everybody knows that,” the 
policeman said. “But we got no 
jurisdiction in a pre-contact sec- 
tor without extradition papers." 

“Wait here,” Viglin said. “I’ll 
get them.” He examined his 
wrist watch carefully, muttered 
something about a half-hour 
gap. and pressed a button on 
the Traveler. Immediately, he 
was gone. 

The two policemen sat down 
on Eldridge’s couch and pro- 
ceeded to ogle the Gauguins. 

Eldridge tried to think, to 
plan, to anticipate. Impossible. 
He could not believe it. He re- 
fused to believe it. No one could 
inake him believe — 

“Imagine a famous guy like 
this being a crook,” one of the 
policemen said. 

“All geniuses are crazy,” the 
other philosophized. “Remem- 
ber the stuggie dancer who kill- 
ed the girl? He was a genius, 
the readies said.” 

“Yeah.” The first policeman 
lighted a cigar and tossed the 
burned mdtch on Eldridge’s 
shaggy little red rug. 



A ll right, Eldridge decided, 
it was true. Under the cir- 
cumstances, he had to believe. 
Nor was it so absurd. He had al- 
ways suspected that he might be 
a genius. 

But what had happened? 

7n 1963, he would invent a 
time machine. 

Logical enough, since he was 
a genius. 

And he would travel through 
the three sectors of Civilized 
Time. 

Well, certainly, assuming he 
had a time machine. If there 
were three sectors, he would ex- 
plore them. 

He might even explore the un- 
civilized sectors. 

And then, without warning, he 
became a thief . 

No! He could accept every- 
thing else, but that was com- 
pletely out of character. Eld- 
ridge was an intensely honest 
young man, quite above even 
petty dishonesties. As a student, 
he had never cheated at exams. 
As a man, he always paid his 
true and proper income tax, 
down to the last penny. 

And it went deeper than that. 
Eldridge had no power drive, 
no urge for possessions. His de- 
sire had always been to settle 
in some warm, drowsy country, 
content with his books and mu- 
sic, sunshine, congenial neigh- 
bors, the love of a good woman. 



lO 



OALAXY SCIENCE EICTION 



So he was accused of theft. 
Even if he were guilty, what 
conceivable motive could have 
prompted the action? 

What had happened to him in 
the future? 

“You going to the scrug ral- 
ly?” one of the cops asked the 
other. 

“Why not? It comes on Malm 
Sunday, doesn’t it?” 

They didn't care. When Vig- 
lin returned, they would hand- 
cuff him and drag him to Sec- 
tor One of the future. He would 
be sentenced and thrown into a 
cell. 

All for a crime he was ioing 
to commit. 

He made a swift decision and 
acted on it quickly. 

“I feel faint,” he said, and be- 
gan to topple out of his chair. 

“Look out — he may have a 
gun!” one of the policemen 
yelped. 

They rushed over to him, 
leaving their time machine on 
the couch. 

Eldridge scuttled around the 
other side of the desk and pounc- 
ed on the machine. Even in his 
haste, he realized that Sector 
One would be an unhealthy 
place for him. So, as the police- 
men sprinted across the room, 
he pushed the button marked 
Sector Two. 

Instantly, he was plunged in- 
to darkness. 



W HEN he opened his eyes, 
Eldridge found that he was 
standing ankle-deep in a pool 
of dirty water. He was in a field, 
twenty feet from a road. The 
air was warm and moist. The 
Time Traveler was clasped tight- 
ly under his arm. 

He was in Sector Two of the 
future and it didn’t thrill him 
a bit. 

He walked to the road. On 
either side of it were terraced 
fields, filled with the green 
stalks of rice plants. 

Rice? In New York State? 
Eldridge remembered that in his 
own time sector, a climatic shift 
had been detected. It was pre- 
dicted that someday the tem- 
perate zones would be hot, per- 
haps tropical. This future seem- 
ed to prove the theory. He was 
perspiring already. The ground 
was damp, as though from a re- 
cent rain, and the sky was an 
intense, unclouded blue. 

But where were the farmers? 
Squinting at the Sun directly 
overhead, he had the answer. 

At siesta, of course. 

Looking down the road, he 
could see buildings half a mile 
away. He scraped mud from his 
shoes and started walking. 

But what would he do when he 
reached the buildings? How 
could he discover what had hap- 
pened to him in Sector One? 
He couldn’t walk up to someone 



A THIEF IN TIME

and say, “Excuse me, sir. I’m 
from 1954, a year you may have 
heard about. It seems that in 
some way or — ” 

No, that would never do. 

He would think of something. 
Eldridge continued walking, 
while the Sun beat down fierce- 
ly upon him. He shifted the 
Traveler to his other arm, then 
looked at it closely. Since he 
was going to invent it — no, al- 
ready had — he’d better find out 
how it worked. 

On its face were buttons for 
the first three sectors of Civilized 
Time. There was a special dial 
for journeying past Sector Three, 
into the Uncivilized Sectors. In 
on corner was a metal • plate, 
which read: caution; Allow at 
least one half-hour between time 
jumps, to avoid cance/Zation. 

That didn’t tell him much. He 
opened the back. Inside, there 
was a regulator set at marking 
2, and locked. Why? He didn’t 
know. All the components were 
unfamiliar to him. The only 
thing he recognized were the bat- 
teries, which were of a type he 
had never seen. Their power rat- 
ing was almost unbelievable. 

It would have to be, he de- 
cided. Time Travel must use 
up a lot of juice. 

He closed the machine again. 
According to Viglin, it had tak- 
en Eldridge eight years — from 
1954 to 1962 — to invent the Tra- 



veler. He would need more than 
a few minutes to understand it. 

T^LDRIDGE reached the 
buildings and found that he 
was in a good-sized town. A few 
people were on the streets, walk- 
ing slowly under the tropical 
Sun. They were dressed entirely 
in white. He was pleased to see 
that styles in Section Two were 
so conservative that his suit 
could pass for a rustic version 
of their dress. 

He passed a large adobe build- 
ing. The sign in front read: 
PUBUC READERY. 

A library. Eldridge stopped. 
Within would undoubtedly be 
the records of the past few hun- 
dred years. There would be an 
account of his crime — if any — 
and the circumstances under 
which he had committed it. 

But would he be safe? Were 
there any circulars out for his 
arrest? Was there an extradition 
between Sectors One and Two? 

He would have to chance it. 
Eldridge entered, walked quick- 
ly past the thin, gray-faced lib- 
rarian, and into the stacks. 

There was a large section on 
Time, but the most thorough 
one-volume treatment was a 
book called Origins of Time 
Travel by Ricardo Alfredex. 
The first part told how the 
young genius Eldridge had, one 
fateful day in 1954, received the 



12 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



germ of the idea from the contro- 
versial Holstead equations. The 
formula was really absurdly 
simple — ^AUredcx quoted the 
main propositions — but no one 
ever had realized it before. Eld- 
ridge’s genius lay chiefly in per- 
ceiving the obvious. 

Eldridge frowned at this dis- 
paragement. Obvious, was it? 
He still didn’t understand it. And 
he was the inventor 1 

By 1962, the machine had 
been built. It worked on the very 
first trial, catapulting its young 
inventor into what became 
known as Sector One. 

Eldridge looked up and found 
that a bespectacled girl of nine 
or so was standing at the end 
of his row of books, staring at 
him. She ducked back out of 
sight. He read on. 

The next chapter was entitled 
‘‘Unparadox of Time.” Eldridge 
skimmed it rapidly. The author 
began with the classic paradox 
of Achilles and the tortoise, and 
demolished it with integral cal- 
culus. Using this as a logical 
foundation, he went on to the 
so-called time paradoxes — kill- 
ing one’s great-great grandfather, 
meeting oneself, and the like. 
These held up no better than 
Zeno’s ancient paradox. Alfredex 
went on to explain that all tem- 
poral paradoxes were the inven- 
tions of authors with a gift for 
confusion. 



Eldridge didn’t understand 
the intricate symbolic logic in 
this part, which was embarrass- 
ing, since he was cited as the 
leading authority. 

T he next chapter was called 
‘‘Fall of the Mighty.” It told 
how Eldridge had met Viglin, 
the owner of a large sj>orting- 
goods store in Sector One. They 
became fast friends. The busi- 
nessman took the shy young 
genius under his wing. He ar- 
ranged lecture tours for him. 
Then— 

‘‘I beg your pardon, sir,” 
someone said. Eldridge looked 
up. The gray-faced librarian was 
standing in front of him. Beside 
her was the bespectacled little 
girl with a smug grin on her 
face. 

“Yes?” Eldridge asked. 

‘‘Time Travelers are not al- 
lowed in the Readery,” the lib- 
rarian said sternly. 

That was understandable, 
Eldridge thought. Travelers 
could grab an armload of valu- 
able books and disappear. They 
probably weren’t allowed in 
banks, either. 

The trouble was, he didn’t 
dare surrender this book. 

Eldridge smiled, tapped his 
ear, and hastily went on reading. 

It seemed that the brilliant 
young Eldridge had allowed 
Viglin to arrange all his con- 



A THIEF IN TIME 



13 



tracts and papers. One day he 
found, to his surprise, that he 
had signed over all rights in 
the Time Traveler to Viglin, 
for a small monetary considera- 
tion. Eldridge brought the case 
to court. The court found against 
him. The case was appealed. 
Penniless and embittered. Eld- 
ridge embarked on his career 
of crime, stealing from Viglin — 

“Sir!” the librarian said. “Deaf 
or not, you must leave at once. 
Otherwise I will call a guard.” 

Eldridge put down the book, 
muttered, “Tattle-tale,” to the 
little girl, and hurried out of 
the Readery. 

Now he knew why Viglin was 
so eager to arrest him. With the 
case still pending, Eldridge 
would be in a very poor posi- 
tion behind bars. 

But why had he stolen? 

The theft of his invention was 
an understandable motive, but 
Eldridge felt certain it was not 
the right one. Stealing from Vig- 
lin would not make him feel any 
better nor would it right the 
wrong. His reaction would be 
either to fight or to withdraw, to 
retire from the whole mess. Any- 
thing except stealing. 

Well, he would find out. He 
would hide in Sector Two. per- 
haps find work. Bit by bit, he 
would — 

Two men seized his arms from 
either side. A third took the 



Traveler away from him. It was 
done so smoothly that Eldridge 
was still gasping when one of 
the men showed a badge. 

“Police,” the man said. "You’ll 
have to come with us, Mr. Eld- 
ridge.” 

“What for?” Eldridge asked. 

“Robbery in Sectors One and 
Two.” 

So he had stolen here, too. 

TTE was taken to the police 
station and into the small, 
cluttered office of the Captain of 
Police. The Captain was a slim, 
balding, cheerful-faced man. He 
waved his subordinates out of 
the room, motioned Eldridge to 
a chair and gave him a cigar- 
ette. 

"So you’re Eldridge,” he said. 

Eldridge nodded morosely. 

“Been reading about you ever 
since I was a little boy,” the 
Captain said nostalgically. "You 
were one of my heroes.” 

Eldridge guessed the Captain 
to be a good fifteen years his 
senior, but he didn’t ask about 
it. After all, he was supposed to 
be the expert on time paradoxes. 

“Always thought you got a 
rotten deal,” the Captain said, 
toying with a large bronze 
paperweight. “Still, I couldn’t 
understand a man like you steal- 
ing. For a while, we thought it 
might have been temporary in- 
sanity.”

“Was it?” Eldhdge asked 
hopefully. 

“Not a chance. Checked your 
records. You just haven’t got the 
potentiality. And that makes it 
rather difficult for me. For ex- 
ample, why did you steal those 
particular items?” 

“What items?” 

“Don’t you remember?” 

“I — I’ve blanked out,” Eld- 
ridge said. “Temporary am- 
nesia." 

“Very understandable.” the 
Captain said sympathetically. 
He handed Eldridge a paper. 
“Here’s the list."

“What does it mean?” the 
Captain asked. “Stealing a mil- 
lion credits outright, I could un- 
derstand, but why all that 
junk?" 

Eldridge shook his head. He 
could find nothing meaningful 
in the list. The megacharge hand 
pistols sounded useful. But why 
the mirrors, lifebelts, potatoes 
and the rest of the things that 
the Captain had properly called 
junk? 

It just didn’t sound like him- 
self. Eldridge began, to think of 
himself as two people. Eldridge I 
had invented time travel, been 
victimized, stolen some incom- 
prehensible articles, and van- 
ished. Eldridge II was himself, the 
person Viglin had found. He had 
no memory of the first Eldridge. 
But he had to discover Eldridge 
I's motives and/or suffer for his 
crimes. 

It was all very confusing. 

“What happened after I stole 
these things?” Eldridge asked. 

“That’s what we’d like to 
know," the Captain said. “All 
we know is, you fled into Sector 
Three with your loot." 

“And then?” 

T he Captain shrugged. “When 
we applied for extradition, 
the authorities told us you 
weren’t there. Not that they’d 
have given you up. They’re a 
proud, independent sort, you 



A THIEF IN TIME 



IS 



know. Anyhow, you’d vanished.” 
‘‘Vanished? To where?” 

‘‘I don’t know. You might 
have gone into the Uncivilized 
Sectors that lie beyond Sector 
Three.” 

‘‘What are the Uncivilized 
Sectors?” Eldridge asked. 

‘‘We were hoping you would 
tell us,” the Captain said. 
“You’re the only man who’s ex- 
plored beyond Sector Three.” 
Damn it, Eldridge thought, he 
was supposed to be the author- 
ity on ever3d:hing he wanted to 
know! 

“^^HIS puts me in a pretty fix,” 
^ the Captain remarked 
squinting at his paperweight. 
"Why?” 

"Well, you’re a thief. The law 
says I must arrest you. How- 
ever, I am also aware that you 
got a very shoddy deal. And I 
happen to know that you stole 
only from Viglin and his affili- 
ates in both Sectors. There’s a 
certain justice to it — unfortun- 
ately unrecognized by law.” 
Eldridge nodded unhappily. 
"It’s my clear duty to ar- 
rest you," the Captain said with 
a deep sigh. “There’s nothing I 
can do about it, even if I wanted 
to. You’ll have to stand trial 
and probably serve a sentence 
of twenty years or so.” 

“What? For stealing rubbish 
like shark repellent and carrot 



seed? For stealing junk?" 

“We’re pretty rough on time 
theft,” said the Captain. "Tem- 
poral offense.” 

“I see,” Eldridge said, slump- 
ing in his chair. 

“Of course,” said the Captain 
thoughtfully, "if you should sud- 
denly turn vicious, knock me 
over the head with this heavy 
paperweight, grab my personal 
Time Traveler — ^which I keep in 
the second shelf of that cabinet 
— and return to your friends in 
Sector Three, there would real- 
ly be nothing I could do about 
it.” 

"Huh?”

The Captain turned toward 
the window, leaving his paper- 
weight within Eldridge’s easy 
reach. 

“It’s really terrible,” he com- 
mented, “the things one will 
consider doing for a boyhood 
hero. But, of course, you’re a 
law-abiding man. You would 
never do such a thing and I have 
psychological reports to prove 
it.” 

“Thanks,” Eldridge said. He 
lifted the paperweight and tap- 
ped the Captain lightly over 
the head. Smiling, the Captain 
slumped behind his desk. Eld- 
ridge found the Traveler in the 



A THIEF IN TIME 



17 



cabinet and set it for Sector 
Three. He sighed deeply and 
pushed the button. 

Again he was overcome by 
darkness. 

V^HEN he opened his eyes, 
** he was standing on a plain 
of parched yellow ground. 
Around him stretched a treeless 
waste, and a dusty wind blew in 
his face. Ahead, he could see 
several brick buildings and a 
row of tents, built along the side 
of a dried'OUt gully. He walked 
toward them. 

This future, he decided, must 
have seen another climatic shift. 
The fierce Sun had baked the 
land, drying up the streams and 
rivers. If the trend continued, 
he could understand why the 
next future was Uncivilised. It 
was probably Unpopulated. 

He was very tired. He had 
not eaten all day — or for several 
thousand years, depending on 
how you count. But that, he 
realized, was a false paradox, 
one that Alfredex would cer- 
tainly demolish with symbolic 
logic. 

To hell with logic. To hell 
with science, paradox, every- 
thing. He would run no further. 
There had to be room for him 
in this dusty land. The people 
here — a proud, independent sort 
— would not give him up. They 
believed in Justice, not the Law. 



Here he would stay, work, grow 
old, and forget Eldridge I and 
his crazy schemes. 

When he reached the village, 
he saw that the people were 
already assembled to greet him. 
They were dressed in long, flow- 
ing robes, like Arabian bur- 
nooses, the only logical attire 
for the climate. 

A bearded patriarch stepped 
forward and nodded gravely at 
Eldridge. “The ancient sayings 
are true. For every beginning 
there is an ending.” 

Eldridge agreed politely. 
“Anyone got a drink of water?” 
he asked. 

“It is truly written," the 
patriarch continued, “that the 
thief, given a universe to wan- 
der, will ultimately return to 
the scene of his crime.” 

“Crime?” Eldridge asked, feel- 
ing an uneasy tingle in his stom- 
ach. 

“Crime,” the patriarch repeat- 
ed. 

A man in the crowd shouted, 
“It’s a stupid bird that fouls its 
own nest!” The people roared 
with laughter, but Eldridge did- 
n’t like the sound. It was cruel 
laughter. 

“Ingratitude breeds betrayal,” 
the patriarch said. “Evil is omni- 
present. We liked you, Thomas 
Eldridge. You came to us with 
your strange machine, bearing 
booty, and we recognized your 



18 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



proud spirit. It made you one of 
us. We protected you from your 
enemies in the Wet Worlds. What 
did it matter to us if you had 
wronged them? Had they not 
wronged you? An eye for an eyel” 

The crowd growled approving- 
ly- 

“But what did I do?” Eldridge 
wanted to know. 

The crowd converged on him, 
waving clubs and knives. A row 
of men in dark blue cloaks held 
them off, and Eldridge realized 
that there were policemen even 
here. 

“Tell me what I did,” he per- 
sisted as the policemen took the 
Traveler from him. 

“As though you didn’t know!” 
the patriarch said. 

“For God’s sake, tell me what 
I did!" 

“You are guilty of sabotage 
and murder,” the patriarch told 
him. 

I^LDRIDGE stared around 
wildly. He had fled a petty 
larceny charge in Sector One, 
only to find himself accused of it 
in Sector Two. He had retreated 
to Sector Three, where he was 
wanted for murder and sabotage. 

He smiled amiably. “You 
know, all I ever really wanted 
was a warm drowsy country, 
books, congenial neighbors, and 
the love of a good — ” 

When he recovered, he found 



himself lying on packed earth in 
a small brick jail. Through a 
slitted window, he could see an 
insignificant strip of sunset. Out- 
side the wooden door, someone 
was wailing a song. 

He found a bowl of food beside 
him and wolfed down the unfa- 
miliar stuff. After drinking some 
water from another bowl, he 
propped himself against the wall. 
Through his narrow window, the 
sunset was fading. In the court- 
yard, a gang of men was erecting 
a gallows. 

“Jailor!” Eldridge shouted. 

In a few moments, he heard 
the clump of footsteps. 

“I need a lawyer,” he said. 

“We have no lawyers here," 
the man replied proudly. “Here 
we have justice.” He marched off. 

Eldridge began to revise his 
ideas about justice without law. 
It was very good as an idea — but 
a horror as reality. 

He lay on the floor and tried 
to think. No thoughts came. He 
could hear the workmen laugh- 
ing and joking as they built the 
gallows. They worked late into 
the twilight. 

In the early evening, Eldridge 
heard the key turn in his lock. 
Two men entered. One was 
middle-aged, with a small, well- 
trimmed beard. The other was 
about Eldridge’s age, broad- 
shouldered and deeply tanned. 

“Do you remember me?” the 



A THIEF IN TIME 



19 



middle-aged man asked. 

"Should I?” 

“You should. I was her father.” 

“And I was her fianc^,” the 
young man said. He took a 
threatening step forward. 

The bearded man restrained 
him. “I know how you feel, Mor- 
gel, but he will pay for his crimes 
on the gallows.” 

“Hanging is too good for him, 
Mr. Becker,” Morgel argued. “He 
should be drawn, quartered, burn- 
ed and scattered to the wind.” 

“Yes, but we are a just and 
merciful people,” Becker said vir- 
tuously. 

“Whose father?” Eldridge ask- 
ed. “Whose fianc€?” 

The two men looked at each 
other. 

“What did I do?” Eldridge 
asked. 

Becker told him. 

TTE had come to them from 
Sector Two, loaded with 
loot, Becker explained. The peo- 
ple of Sector Three accepted 
him. They were a simple folk, 
direct and quick-tempered, the 
inheritors of a wasted, war-torn 
Earth. In Sector Three, the min- 
erals were gone, the soil had lost 
its fertility. Huge tracts of land 
were radioactive. And the Sun 
continued to beat down, the gla- 
ciers melted, and the oceans con- 
tinued to rise. 

The men of Sector Three were 



struggling back to civilization. 
They had the rudiments of a 
manufacturing system and a few 
power installations. Eldridge had 
increased the output of these sta- 
tions, given them a lighting sys- 
tem, and taught them the rudi- 
ments of sanitary processing. He 
continued his explorations into 
the Unexplored Sectors beyond 
Sector Three. He became a popu- 
lar hero and the people of Sector 
Three loved and protected him. 

Eldridge had repaid this kind- 
ness by abducting Becker’s 
daughter. 

This attractive young lady had 
been engaged to Morgel. Prepara- 
tions were made for her marriage. 
Eldridge ignored all this and 
showed his true nature by kid- 
napping her one dark night and 
placing her in an infernal ma- 
chine of his own making. When 
he turned the invention on, the 
girl vanished. The overloaded 
power lines blew out every in- 
stallation for miles around. 

Murder and sabotage! 

But the irate mob had not 
been able to reach Eldridge in 
time. He had stuHed some of his 
loot into a knapsack, grabbed his 
Traveler and vanished. 

“I did all that?” Eldridge 
gasped. 

"Before witnesses,” Becker 
said. “Your remaining loot is in 
the warehouse. We could deduce 
nothing from it.” 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE MCTtON 



With both men staring him full 
in the face. Eldridge looked at 
the ground. 

Now he knew what he had 
done in Sector Three. 

The murder charge was prob- 
ably false, though. Apparently he 
had built a heavy-duty Traveler 
and sent the girl somewhere, 
without the intermediate stops 
required by the portable models. 
Not that anyone would believe 
him. These people had never 
heard of such a civilized concept 
as habeas corpus. 

“Why did you do it?” Becker 
asked. 

Eldridge shrugged his shoul- 
ders and shook his head help- 
lessly. 

“Didn’t I treat you like my 
own son? Didn’t I turn back the 
police of Sector Two? Didn't I 
feed you, clothe you? Why — why 
—did you do it?” 

All Eldridge could do was 
shrug his shoulders and go on 
helplessly shaking his head. 

“Very well,” Becker said. “Tell 
your secret to the hangman in 
the morning.” 

He took Morgel by the arm 
and left. 

I F Eldridge had had a gun, he 
might have shot himself on 
the spot. All the evidence pointed 
to potentialities for evil in him 
that he had never suspected. He 
was running out of time. In the 



morning, he would hang. 

And it was unfair, all of it. He 
was an innocent bystander, con- 
tinually running into the conse- 
quences of his former — or later 
— actions. But only Eldridge I 
possessed the motives and knew 
the answers. 

Even if his thefts were justified, 
why had he stolen potatoes, life- 
belts, mirrors and such? 

What had he done with the 
girl? 

What was he trying to accom- 
plish? 

Wearily, Eldridge closed his 
eyes and drifted into a troubled 
half-sleep. 

He heard a faint scraping noise 
and looked up. 

Viglin was standing there, a 
Traveler in his hands. 

Eldridge was too tired to be 
very surprised. He looked for a 
moment, then said, “Come for 
one last gloat?” 

“I didn’t plan it this way,” 
Viglin protested, mopping his 
perspiring face. “You must be- 
lieve that. I never wanted you 
killed, Tom.” 

Eldridge sat up and looked 
closely at Viglin. “You did steal 
my invention, didn’t you?” 

“Yes,” Viglin confessed. “But 
I was going to do the right thing 
by you. I would have split the 
profits.” 

“Then why did you steal it?” 

Viglin looked uncomfortable. 



A THIEF IN TIME 



21 



“You weren’t interested in money 
at all.” 

“So you tricked me into sign- 
ing over my rights?” 

“If I hadn’t, someone else 
would have, Tom. I was just 
saving you from your own un- 
worldliness. I intended to cut 
you in — I swear it!” He wiped 
his forehead again. “But I never 
dreamed it would turn out like 
this.” 

“And then you framed me for 
those thefts,” Eldridge said. The 
thing was making sense now. 

“What?” Viglin appeared to be 
genuinely surprised. “No, Tom. 
You did steal those things. It 
worked out perfectly for me — 
until now.” 

“You’re lying!” 

“Would I come here to lie? 
I've admitted stealing your in- 
vention. Why would I lie about 
anything else?” 

“Then why did I steal?” 

“I think you had some sort of 
wild scheme in the Uninhabited 
Sectors, but I don’t really know. 
It doesn’t matter. Listen to me 
now. There’s no way I can call 
off the lawsuit — it’s a temporal 
matter now — but I can get you 
out of here." 

“Where will I go?” Eldridge 
asked hopelessly. “The cops are 
looking for me all through time.” 
“I’ll hide you on my estate. 
I mean it. You can lie low until 
the statute of limitations has ex- 



pired. They’d never think of 
searching my place for you.” 
“And the rights on my inven- 
tion?” 

“I’m keeping them,” Viglin 
said, with a touch of his former 
confidence. “I can’t turn them 
over to you without making my- 
self liable for temporal action. 
But I will share them. And you 
do need a business partner.” 
“All right, let’s get out of 
here,” Eldridge said. 

y lGLIN had brought along a 
number of tools, which he 
handled with suspicious profici- 
ency. Within minutes, they were 
out of the cell and hiding in the 
dark courtyard. 

“This Traveler’s pretty weak,” 
Viglin whispered, checking the 
batteries in his machine. “Could 
we possibly get yours?” 

“It should be in the store- 
house,” Eldridge said. 

The storehouse was unguarded 
and Viglin made short work of 
the lock. Inside, they foimd 
Eldridge II’s machine beside 
Eldridge I’s preposterous, be- 
wildering loot. 

“Let’s go,” Viglin said. 
Eldridge shook his head. 
“What’s wrong?” asked Vig- 
lin, annoyed. 

“I’m not going.” 

“Listen, Tom, I know there’s 
no reason why you should trust 
me. But I really will give you 



22 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sanctuary. I’m not lying to you.” 

“I believe you,” Eldridge said. 
“Just the same, I’m not going 
back." 

“What are you planning to 
do?” 

Eldridge had been wondering 
about that ever since they had 
broken out of the cell. He was 
at the crossroads now. He could 
return with Viglin or he could 
go on alone. 

There was no choice, really. 
He had to assume that he had 
known what he was doing the 
first time. Right or wrong, he was 
going to keep faith and meet 
whatever appointments he had 
made with the future. 

‘Tm going into the Unin- 
habited Sectors,” Eldridge said. 
He found a sack and began load- 
ing it with potatoes and carrot 
seeds. 

“You can’t!” Viglin objected. 
“The first time, you ended up in 
1954. You might not be so lucky 
this time. You might be canceled 
out completely.” 

Eldridge had loaded all the 
potatoes and the packages of car- 
rot seeds. Next he slipped in the 
World Literature Sets, the life- 
belts, the cans of shark repellent 
and the mirrors. On top of this 
he put the megacharge hand 
pistols. 

“Have you any idea what 
you’re going to do with that 
stuff?” 



“Not the slightest,” Eldridge 
said, buttoning the Symphonic 
Tape Runs inside his shirt. “But 
they must fit somewhere.” 

Viglin sighed heavily. “Don't 
forget, you have to allow half an 
hour between jumps or you’ll get 
canceled. Have you got a watch?” 
“No, I left it in my room.” 
“Take this one. Sporteman’s 
Special.” Viglin attached it to 
Eldridge’s wrist. “Good luck, 
Tom. I mean that.” 

“Thanks.” 

Eldridge set the button for the 
farthest jump into the future he 
could make. He grinned at Vig- 
Itn and pushed the button. 

There was the usual moment of 
blackness, then a sudden icy 
shock. When Eldridge opened his 
eyes, he found that he was under 
water. 

T¥E found his way to the sur- 
face, struggling against the 
weight of the sack. Once his head 
was above water, he looked 
around for the nearest land. 

There was no land. Long, 
smooth-backed waves slid toward 
him from the limitless horizon, 
lifted him and ran on, toward a 
hidden shore. 

Eldridge fumbled in his sack, 
found the lifebelts and inflated 
them. Soon he was bobbing on 
the surface, trying to figure out 
what had happened to New York 
State. 



A THIEF IN TIME 



23 




Each jump into the future had 
brought him to a hotter climate. 
Here, countless thousands of 
years past 1954, the glaciers must 
have melted. A good part of the 
Earth was probably submerged. 

He had planned well in taking 
the lifebelts. It gave him confi- 
dence for the rest of the journey. 
Now he would just have to float 
for half an hour, to avoid cancel- 
lation. 

He leaned back, supp>orted by 
the lifebelts, and admired the 
cloud formations in the sky. 

Something brushed against 
him. 

Eldridge looked down and saw 



a long black shape glide under 
his feet. Another joined it and 
they began to move hungrily to- 
ward him. 

Sharks! 

He fumbled wildly with the 
sack, spilling out the mirrors in 
his hurry, and found a can of 
shark repellent. He opened it, 
spilled it overboard, and an 
orange blotch began to spread 
on the blue -black water. 

There were three sharks now. 
They swam warily around the 
spreading circle of repellent. A 
fourth joined them, lunged into 
the orange smear, and retreated 
quickly to clean water. 



24 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Eldridge was glad the future 
had produced a shark repellent 
that really worked. 

In five minutes, some of the 
orange had dissipated. He open- 
ed another can. The sharks did- 
n’t give up hope, but they would- 
n’t swim into the tainted water. 
He emptied the cans every five 
minutes. The stalemate held 
through Eldridge’s half-hour 
wait. 

He checked his settings and 
tightened his grip on the sack. 
He didn’t know what the mirrors 
or potatoes were for, or why car- 
rot seeds were critical. He would 
just have to take his chances. 

THIEF IN TIME 




He pressed the button and went 
into the familiar darkness. 

He found himself ankle-deep in 
a thick, evil-smelling bog. The 
heat was stifling and a cloud of 
huge gnats buzzed around his 
head. 

■pULLING himself out of the 
gluey mud, accompanied by 
the hiss and click of unseen life. 
Eldridge found firmer footing un- 
der a small tree. Around him was 
green jungle, shot through with 
riotous purples and reds. 

Eldridge settled against the 
tree to wait out his half hour. In 
this future, apparently, the ocean 






waters had receded and the pri- 
meval jungle had sprung up. 
Were there any humans here? 
Were there any left on Earth? He 
wasn’t at all sure. It looked as 
though the world was starting 
over. 

Eldridge heard a bleating noise 
and saw a dull green shape move 
against the brighter green of the 
foliage. Something was coming 
toward him. 

He watched. It was about 
twelve feet tall, with a lizard’s 
wrinkled hide and wide splay feet. 
It looked amazingly like a small 
dinosaur. 

Eldridge watched the big rep- 
tile warily. Most dinosaurs were 
herbivorous, he reminded himself, 
especially the ones that lived in 
swamps. This one probably just 
wanted to sniff him. Then it 
would return to cropping grass. 

The dinosaur yawned, reveal- 
ing a magnificent set of pointed 
teeth, and began to approach 
Eldridge with an air of deter- 
mination. 

Eldridge dipped into the sack, 
pushed irrelevant items out of the 
way, and grabbed a megacharge 
hand pistol. 

This had better be it, he pray- 
ed, and fired. 

The dinosaur vanished in a 
spray of smoke. There were only 
a few shreds of flesh and a smell 
of ozone to show where it had 
been. Eldridge looked at the 



megacharge hand pistol with new 
respect. Now he understood why 
it was so expensive. 

During the next half hour, a 
number of jungle inhabitants took 
a lively interest in him. Each pis- 
tol was good for only a few fir- 
ings — no surprise, considering 
their destructiveness. His last one 
began to lose its charge; he had 
to club off a pterodactyl with the 
butt. 

When the half hour was over, 
he set the dial again, wishing he 
knew what lay ahead. He won- 
dered how he was supposed to 
face new dangers with some 
books, potatoes, carrot seeds and 
mirrors. 

Perhaps there were no dangers 
ahead. 

There was only one way to 
find out. He pressed the button. 

TTE was on a grassy hillside. 

The dense jungle had disap- 
peared. Now there was a breeze- 
swept pine forest stretching be- 
fore him, solid ground underfoot, 
and a temperate sun in the sky. 

Eldridge’s pulse quickened at 
the thought that this might be his 
goal. He had always had an ata- 
vistic streak, a desire to find a 
place untouched by civilization. 
The embittered Eldridge I, rob- 
bed and betrayed, must have felt 
it even more strongly. 

It was a little disappointing. 
Still, it wasn’t too bad, he decid-

ed. Except for the loneliness. If 
only there were people — 

A man stepped out of the for- 
est. He was less than five feet tall, 
thick-set. muscled like a wrestler 
and wearing a fur kilt. His skin 
was colored a medium gray. He 
carried a ragged tree limb, rough- 
ly shaped into a club. 

Two dozen others came 
through the forest behind him. 
They marched directly up to 
Eldridge. 

“Hello, fellows,” Eldridge said 
pleasantly. 

The leader replied in a gut- 
tural language and made a ges- 
ture with his open palm. 

“I bring your crops blessings,” 
Eldridge said promptly. ‘T’ve got 
just what you need.” He reached 
into his sack and held up a pack- 
age of carrot seeds. “Seeds! You’ll 
advance a thousand years in civi- 
lization — ” 

The leader grunted angrily and 
his followers began to circle 
Eldridge. They held out their 
hands, palms up, grunting excit- 
edly. 

They didn’t want the sack and 
they refused the discharged hand 
pistol. They had him almost com- 
pletely circled now. Clubs were 
being hefted and he still had no 
idea what they wanted. 

“Potato?” he asked in despera- 
tion. 

They didn’t want potatoes, 
either. 



His time machine had two 
minutes more to wait. He turned 
and ran. 

The savages were after him at 
once. Eldridge sprinted into the 
forest like a grayhound, dodging 
through the closely packed trees. 
Several clubs whizzed past him. 

One minute to go. 

He tripped over a root, scram- 
bled to his feet and kept on run- 
ning. The savages were close on 
his heels. 

Ten seconds. Five seconds. A 
club glanced ofT his shoulder. 

Time! He reached for the but- 
ton — and a club thudded against 
his head, knocking him to the 
ground. When he could focus 
again, the leader of the savages 
was standing over his Time Trav- 
eler, club raised. 

“Don’t!” Eldridge yelled in 
panic. 

But the leader grinned wildly 
and brought down the club. In a 
few seconds, he had reduced the 
machine to scrap metal. 

T^LDRIDGE was dragged into 
^ a cave, cursing hopelessly. 
Two savages guarded the en- 
trance. Outside, he could see a 
gang of men gathering wood. Wo- 
men and children were scamper- 
ing back and forth, laden down 
with clay containers. To judge 
by their laughter, they were plan- 
ning a feast. 

Eldridge realized, with a sink- 



A THIEF IN TIME 



27 



ing sensation, that he would be 
the main dish. 

Not that it mattered. They 
had destroyed his Traveler. No 
Viglin would rescue him this 
time. He was at the end of his 
road. 

Eldridge didn’t want to die. 
But what made it worse was the 
thought of dying without ever 
finding out what Eldridge I had 
planned. 

It seemed unfair, somehow. 

For several minutes, he sat in 
abject self-pity. Then he crawled 
farther back into the cave, hop- 
ing to find another way out. 

The cave ended abruptly 
against a wall of granite. But he 
found something else. 

, An old shoe. 

He picked it up and stared at 
it. For some reason, it bothered 
him, although it was a perfectly 
ordinary brown leather shoe, just 
like the ones he had on. 

Then the anachronism struck 
him. 

What was a manufactured ar- 
ticle like a shoe doin^ back in this 
dawn a^e? 

He looked at the size and 
quickly tried it on. It fitted him 
exactly, which made the answer 
obvious — he must have passed 
through here on his first trip. 

But why had he left a shoe? 

There was something inside, 
too soft to be a pebble, too stiff 
to be a piece of torn lining. He 



took off the shoe and found a 
piece of paper wadded in the 
toe. He unfolded it and read in 
his own handwriting: 

Silliest damned business — how do 
7 'ou address yourself? *‘Dear El- 
dridge”? All right, let’s forget the 
salutation; you’ll read this because I 
already have, and so, naturally, I’m 
writing it, otherwise you wouldn’t 
be able to read it, nor would 1 have 
been. 

Look, you’re in a rough spot. 
Don’t worry about it, though. You’ll 
come out of it in one piece. I’m leav- 
ing you a Time Traveler to take you 
where yon have to go next. 

The question is: where do I go? 
I’m deliberately setting the Traveler 
before the half-hour lag it needs, 
knowing there will be a cancellation 
effect. That means the Traveler will 
stay here for you to use. But what 
happens to me? 

1 think I know. Still, it scares me 
— this is the first cancellation I’ll 
have experienced. But worrying 
about it is nonsensical; I know it has 
to turn out right because there are 
no time paradoxes. 

Well, here goes. I’ll push the but- 
ton and cancel. Then the machine is 
yours. 

Wish me luck. 

W ISH him luck! Eldridge sav- 
agely tore up the note and 
threw it away. 

But Eldridge I had purposely 
canceled and been swept back to 
the future, which meant that the 
Traveler hadn't gone back with 
him! It must still be here! 

Eldridge began a frantic search 
of the cave. If he could just find 
it and push the button, he could 
go on ahead. It had to be here!

Several hours later, when the 
guards dragged him out, he still 
hadn't found it. 

The entire village had gathered 
and they were in a festive mood. 
The clay containers were being 
passed freely and two or three 
men had already passed out. But 
the guards who led Eldridge for- 
ward were sober enough. 

They carried him to a wide, 
shallow pit. In the center of it 
was what looked like a sacrificial 
altar. It was decorated with wild 
colors and heaped around it was 
an enormous pile of dried 
branches. 

Eldridge was pushed in and 
the dancing began. 

He tried several times to 
scramble out, but was prodded 
back each time. The dancing con- 
tinued for hours, until the last 
dancer had collapsed, exhausted. 

An old man approached the 
rim of the pit, holding a lighted 
torch. He gestured with it and 
threw it into the pit. 

Eldridge stamped it out. But 
more torches rained down, light- 
ing the outermost branches. They 
flared brightly and he was forced 
to retreat inward, toward the al- 
tar. 

The flaming circle closed, driv- 
ing him back. At last, panting, 
eyes burning, legs buckling, he 
fell across the altar as the flames 
licked at him. 

His eyes were closed and he 



gripi>ed the knobs tightly— 

Knobs? 

He looked. Under its gaudy 
decoration, the altar was a Time 
Traveler — the same Traveler, 
past a doubt, that Eldridge I 
had brought here and left for him. 
When Eldridge I vanished, they 
must have venerated it as a 
sacred object. 

And it did have magical quali- 
ties. 

The fire was singeing his feet 
when he adjusted the regulator. 
With his finger against the but- 
ton, he hesitated. 

What would the future hold 
for him? Ail he had in the way 
of equipment was a sack of car- 
rot seeds, potatoes, the sym- 
phonic runs, the microfilm vol- 
umes of world literature and 
small mirrors. 

But he had come this far. He 
would see the end. 

He pressed the button. 

rf^PENING his eyes, Eldridge 
found that he was standing 
on a beach. Water was lapping at 
his toes and he could hear the 
boom of breakers. 

The beach was long and nar- 
row and dazzingly white. In front 
of him. a blue ocean stretched to 
infinity. Behind him, at the edge 
of the beach, was a row of palms. 
Growing among them was the 
brilliant vegetation of a tropical 
island. 



A THIEF IN TIME 



29 



He heard a shout. 

Eldridge looked around for 
something to defend himself 
with. He had nothing, nothing at 
all. He was defenseless. 

Men came running from the 
jungle toward him. They were 
shouting something strange. He 
listened carefully. 

“Welcome! Welcome back!” 
they called out. 

A gigantic brown man enclos- 
ed him in a bearlike hug. “You 
have returned!” he exclaimed. 

“Why — yes,” Eldridge said. 

More people were running 
down to the beach. They were a 
comely race. The men were tall 
and tanned, and the women, for 
the most part, were slim and 
pretty. They looked like the sort 
of people one would like to have 
for neighbors. 

“Did you bring them?” a thin 
old man asked, panting from his 
run to the beach. 

“Bring what?” 

“The carrot seeds. You prom- 
ised to bring them. And the po- 
tatoes.” 

Eldridge dug them out of his 
pockets. “Here they are,” he 
said. 

“Thank you. Do you really 
think they’ll grow in this climate? 
I suppose we could construct 
a — ” 

“Later, later,” the big man in- 
terrupted. “You must be tired.” 

Eldridge thought back to what 



had happened since he had last 
awakened, back in 1954. Subjec- 
tively, it was only a day or so, but 
it had covered thousands of years 
back and forth and was cram- 
med with arrests, escapes, dang- 
ers and bewildering puzzles. 

“Tired,” he said. “Very^.” 

“Perhaps you’d like to return 
to your own home?” 

“My own?” 

“Certainly. The house you built 
facing the lagoon. Don’t you re- 
member?” 

Eldridge smiled feebly and 
shook his head. 

“He doesn’t remember!” the 
man cried. 

“You don’t remember our chess 
games?” another man asked. 

“And the hshing parties?” a 
boy put in. 

“Or the picnics and celebra- 
tions?” 

“The dances?” 

“And the sailing?” 

I^LDRIDGE shook his head at 
each eager, worried ques- 
tion. 

“All this was before you went 
back to your own time,” the big 
man told him. 

“Went back?” asked Eldridge. 
Here was everything he had al- 
ways wanted. Peace, content- 
ment, warm climate, good neigh- 
bors. He felt inside the sack and 
his shirt. And books and music, 
he mentally added to the list. 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Good Lord, no one in his right 
mind would leave a place like 
this ! And that brought up an im- 
portant question. “Why did I 
leave here?” 

“Surely you remember that!*' 
the big man said. 

“I’m afraid not.” 

A slim, light-haired girl step- 
ped forward. “You really don’t 
remember coming back for me?” 
Eldridge stared at her. “You 
must be Becker’s daughter. The 
girl who was engaged to Morgel. 
The one I kidnapped.” 

“Morgel only thought he was 
engaged to me,” she said. “And 
you didn’t kidnap me. I came of 
my own free will.” 

“Oh, I see,” Eldridge answered, 
feeling like an idiot. “I mean 1 
think I see. That is — pleased to 
meet you,” he finished inanely. 

“You needn’t be so formal,” 
she said. “After all, we are mar- 
ried. And you did bring me a 
mirror, didn’t you?” 

It was complete now. Eldridge 
grinned, took out a mirror, gave 
it to her, and handed the sack to 
the big man. Delighted, she did 
the things with her eyebrows and 
hair that women always do when- 
ever they see their reflections. 

“Let’s go home, dear,” she 
said. 

He didn’t know her name, but 
he liked her looks. He liked her 
very much. But that was only 
natural. 



“I’m afraid I can’t right now,” 
he replied, looking at his watch. 
The half hour was almost up. “I 
have something to do first. But I 
should be back in a very little 
while.” 

She smiled sunnily. “I won’t 
worry. You said you would re- 
turn and you did. And you 
brought back the mirrors and 
seed and potatoes that you told 
us you’d bring.” 

She kissed him. He shook 
hands all around. In a way, that 
symbolized the full cycle Alfredex 
had used to demolish the foolish 
concept of temporal paradoxes. 

The familiar darkness swal- 
lowed Eldridge as he pushed the 
button on the Traveler. 

He had ceased being Eldridge 
II. 

From this point on, he was 
Eldridge I and he knew precisely 
where he was going, what he 
would do and the things he need- 
ed to do them. They all led to 
this goal and this girl, for there 
was no question that he would 
come back here and live out his 
life with her, their good neigh- 
bors, books and music, in peace 
and contentment. 

It was wonderful, knowing that 
ever 5 rthing would turn out just as 
he had always dreamed. 

He even had a feeling of affec- 
tion and gratitude for Viglin and 
Alfredex.

By R. E. BANKS 



T he soft moon shone on 
the grass, on the white 
markers, on the rubble of 
the city and on the upstart tent 
town of the aliens. 

It shone on the white hospital, 
most of which still remained 
standing. 

It shone on the clean, youth- 
ful features of old Dr. Gan who, 
though a Thurkian, didn’t con- 
sider himself an alien at all, so 
deeply had he studied Earth. It 
was early spring and the cold 
night air had a touch of life and 
warmth to it, a touch of wonder. 



This was the planet Earth, third 
planet from the sun of this solar 
system — 

The miracle planet. 

The only planet in all space 
whose beings had found immor- 
tality. 

Dr. Gan was now moving 
across the birthgrounds of the 
Earthmen. Each birthplace was 
marked with white marble. On 
it was the baby’s name, plus 
the allotted number of years he 
was to live before pregnating 
into immortality. He stooped to 
read one of them.

JESSE H. SMITH 
1883-1953 
R.I.P. 

Very clever and orderly of these 
Earthmen, to mark ahead of its 
birth how long each baby was to 
exist. 

On the planet Thurkos, things 
were done much more haphazard- 
ly. Spontaneity was the curse of 
his species, thought Dr. Gan. 
They came into existence out of 
nowhere, spontaneously. They 
lived their lives and, when their 
time was up, their bodies vanish- 
ed as strangely as they came, in a 
sudden disintegration of totality 
which left nothing behind. 

I^ARTHMEN were smarter. 
Dr. Gan mused. They, too, 
came alive in spontaneity. Only 
instead of appearing full-bodied 
and naked on the streets, like the 
Thurkians, they appeared in 
boxes six feet long, three feet 
wide, buried six feet down in the 
ground. How wonderful it must 
have been to begin life so — hav- 
ing a plot of ground for your 
very own, wearing clothes, having 
a warm box to lie in! R.I.P. — 
that meant Ready - In - Place, 
come and get me — I’m ready to 
start life. 

Then your Earth fellows came 
to these great birthplaces — pleas- 
ant, grassy places with many 
flowers — and dug you up. They 



took you to the great hospitals, 
like the one over there. They 
cleaned you up, assigned you to 
a family and you went home to 
begin life. 

Like Thurkians, Earthmen 
were born with pseudo-teeth com- 
pletely removable from the 
mouth, with face-wrinkles and 
bent bones. Then both races grew 
old, getting hair, getting white 
teeth, getting straighter, more 
powerful figures. 

But the Thurkians shrank over 
the years, getting smaller and, 
ultimately, vanished without a 
trace, whereas the Earthmen were 
smarter. In their extreme old 
age, they also grew to" be very 
tiny indeed. They wore white 
pants made out of a triangle of 
cloth and bobbed their heads 
and were carried in the arms of 
the family female. 

Then they chose a certain fe- 
male relative — curiously always 
female — and accompanied her to 
the hospital. 

There they entered what was 
called a “Delivery Room" and 
fhus delivered themselves unto 
the woman. They actually be- 
came a part of her and she went 
on living! Thus Earthmen went 
on living, and it was a strangely 
marvelous immortality. 

To pregnate and become part 
of another, instead of simply dy- 
ing — a glorious way to end old 
age! 



THIS SIDE UP 



33 



Now the Thurkians were go- 
ing to attempt that same immor- 
tality, thought old Dr. Gan, walk- 
ing rapidly across the ■ birthyard 
of the Earthmen with the springy 
steps of his old age. Each day, 
his muscles grew stronger, his 
mind more alert in advanced age. 
Inside of ten years, he’d be old 
and tiny. Earthmen, oddly 
enough, called this stage of life 
"childhood.” And then shortly 
after that period he’d simply 
vanish. 

Unless this new pregnating sys- 
tem of Dr. Duk’s worked. 

He sighed, expelling the soft 
spring air. He was filled with 
wonder at the greatness of the 
Earthmen, at the fortunate land- 
ing of his people on this planet 
and at the glorious future they 
were now sure to find. 

He himself was lucky to be 
here — after all the sins he had 
committed. Only the kindness of 
Dr. Duk . 

He entered the hospital. It 
hummed with activity. Yester- 
day, the Princess of the People 
had landed — tomorrow, the first 
great pregnating experiment was 
to be performed. 

He went directly to his work- 
place, the tiny room where the 
only existing Earthman lived. 

^AN checked in and relieved 
Tok. Tok’s eyes swam with 
the importance of these days as 



did those of everyone else. The 
Thurkians couldn’t be wrong — 
cell for cell, organ for organ, they 
were almost exactly like Earth- 
men. 

Put the two races together 
on a street and you couldn’t tell 
them apart. And now the Thur- 
kians were about to reach im- 
mortal life . 

"How is he?” 

“He is well,” said Tok, nodding 
toward the last Earthman. "No 
special instructions, except to 
speed up the testing.” Then Tok 
hurried out to pay homage to the 
Princess of the People, the lovely 
A2a, she of the form divine. She 
of . 

Dr. Gan turned to his work 
with a sigh. No reason for a dis- 
credited scientist like himself to 
dream of her high person. He was 
a minor figure and would always 
remain so, alongside the great Dr. 
Duk. 

The last Earthman lived in a 
magnificent machine designed by 
these superior Earth beings. He 
must have lived in this room for 
many years after the last of the 
Earthmen had gone, his wants 
cared for by the machine. The 
Thurkians had no name for the 
machine, but it was a metallic 
aid to respiration — a sort of metal 
lung. 

One did not like to contemplate 
what the Earthmen had done to 
themselves to pulverize their 



34 



OAIAXY SCIINCE FICTION 



planet so. But that was a matter 
apart from the great experiment. 
The Earthmen had left very little 
above the ground, so very little 
that it had taken a brain like that 
of Dr. Duk to extrapolate their 
lives. Whatever their mistake, 
it could not be repeated by the 
Thurkians, Gan thought ag- 
gressively. The Thurkians would 
steal their immortality and guard 
each and every one of their end- 
less lives jealously. 

He glanced at the last Earth- 
man, but that individual paid no 
attention to him. He was so old 
he was beginning to lose the shav- 
ing function. Very few hairs ap- 
peared on his cheeks. His hair 
had the thickness of age, his eyes 
had the age-sparkle . 

“If you could only speak.” 
said Gan for probably the thou- 
sandth time. “If I could only 
reach you to tell you how much 
we appreciate your miraculous 
gift to us.” 

But there would most likely 
never be any communication. The 
Earthman was deaf and dumb 
and paralyzed. There were times 
when he followed them with his 
eyes. The balance of the time he 
lay in his machine, indifferent to 
their presence. 

O UT of kindness to this last 
remnant of a great race, they 
would pregnate this survivor 
some day, fit him into the body 



of a woman — a Thurkian, of 
course — and thus guarantee his 
immortality. It would be a proud 
day for Thurkian science — ^the 
pupils aiding the last of the great 
masters by the masters’ own 
methods! 

Dr. Gan sighed happily and 
turned back to his routine. He 
checked the dials. The Earth- 
man was well-fed, body tempera- 
ture and pulse were normal. Gan 
fed the raw food into the machine 
that cooked and fed the patient, 
as he listened with half an ear to 
the bustle that was going on in 
the hospital corridors. 

Now that the Princess was 
here, things were moving fast. It 
was sad for Gan to be assigned 
to this tiny room, cut off from the 
excitement that spread from Dr. 
Duk’s offices throughout the 
building. 

But perhaps Princess Aza 
would visit this room! Gan felt 
his heart quiver deliciously at 
the thought. Absently, he picked 
up two objects from the testing 
blanket and moved toward the 
Earthman. 

This testing went on day after 
day. It would have been much 
simpler if they could have found 
a way to communicate with him. 
But the artifacts available were 
hard to understand and the at- 
tendants grew increasingly bored 
each day as various objects were 
tried without effect. 



THIS SIDE UP 



35 



r^R. GAN stood over him, hold- 
^ ing the two objects. One was 
a small package, filled with tubes 
— twenty of them. Each tube 
consisted of a white paper tight- 
ly wrapped around some dark- 
brown shredded leaf. He shoved 
one out of the package and held 
it before the patient’s face. The 
Earthman looked up at him apa- 
thetically. Gan suspected that he 
considered them fools, but his 
frozen face muscles were unable 
to mirror his thoughts. 

Gan smelled the white tube. 
Acrid! In the flame it gave off a 
displeasing blue smoke. Still, ev- 
erything had to be tested on the 
Earthman — that was part of his 
job. 

He shoved it in the lax mouth 
as far as it would go. It came 
right out again, wilted with sa- 
liva. 

“Can you hear me?” Gan ask- 
ed routinely. No, it was obvious 
he’d misjudged the tube’s pur- 
pose. 

He fitted another one in the 
Earthman’s ear. “Can you hear 
me?” 

The Earthman looked annoy- 
ed. Gan shoved another tube in 
his other ear. “Can you hear 
me?” 

The man lay there, a short 
white tube protruding from each 
ear. The Doctor would have 
sworn that his face reddened. 

Gan removed the tubes and 



threw them away. The next ob- 
ject was marked in weird hiero- 
glyphics S-o-n-o-v-o-x and had 
a trademark imprint of a tiny 
ear. Gan frowned at the inde- 
cipherable writing. He wished the 
code had been broken to inter- 
pret Earth’s language, but there 
was really less need, now that 
the great Dr. Duk had extrapo- 
lated everything so well. 

There were a tiny plug and a 
flat box, separated by a long 
wire. He studied the device. He 
looked down at the patient, 
whose eyes were wide open and 
fixed, a sure sign that Gan held 
his attention. 

“Oh, come,” Gan said aloud. 
“I can’t stuff this device in your 
ear or your mouth.” 

He examined the box — a tiny 
battery set and what looked like 
an amplifier circuit. 

Hmmmmm . 

He opened the Earthman’s 
mouth and stuffed the battery in. 
That didn’t set well with the 
patient and he quickly removed 
it. He put the plug in the man’s 
mouth from where it was imme- 
diately spat out. 

Oh, well — it couldn’t have any- 
thing to do with hearing, be- 
cause any fool knew you could 
hear better with your mouth 
open. At least Thurkians could, 
and Earthmen physically resem- 
bled Thurkians. 

He tossed the object on the 



36 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



testing blanket and walked to the 
door, listening to sounds in the 
corridor. The Princess might well 
come to visit the last Earthman 
on his shift. Pray that she would ! 

T¥E turned back. The Earth- 
man was going crazy. For 
him, that meant his eyes were 
blinking a mile a minute. Gan 
had never seen him blink so fast, 
try so hard to catch the attend- 
ant’s eye. 

He must want the tubes back. 
Gan got the little white tubes. 
His patient closed his eyes and 
imperceptibly dropped his head 
to one side — the way Gan himself 
did when he was disgusted with 
someone. 

Gan held the device uncertain- 
ly over the Earthman. 

The Earthman blinked like 
mad. 

Gan shrugged and shoved the 
tiny plug in the man’s ear. It 
fitted. So? Gan fiddled with the 
dial. 

“Can you hear me? Can you 
hear me?” 

Eyes open, mouth open, head 
imperceptibly nodding. It was 
the wildest, strongest reaction 
he’d ever seen the man make. 

Gan felt an excited rush of 
pleasure. For a moment he for- 
got all about the events outside. 
This was the first real reaction 
anyone had ever gotten from the 
Earthman. 



He leaned forward. “If you can 
hear me, close your right eye and 
blink it open again.” 

The man closed his left eye and 
blinked it open again. 

The mute Earthman had got- 
ten it backward. For the first 
time, Gan felt an uneasy doubt 
about the greatness of the 
Earthmen. 

“If you can hear me, close your 
left eye and blink it open,” he 
said. 

The man blinked his right eye. 

Something was radically wrong 
here. Still, the main problem was 
solved, wasn’t it? If he chose to 
call left right and right left, it 
didn’t matter so long as he was 
consistent. 

But more was involved. 

Gan sat in a chair. The old 
ache and throb were beginning to 
start again in his mind — the 
things he’d put behind him. The 
simplicity -to-complexity theory 
that had gotten him in trouble 
with Dr. Duk and the other sci- 
entists of Thurkia, destroyed his 
reputation and turned him into 
an insignificant male nurse. 

“Every intelligent person 
knows,” Dr. Duk had said, “that 
the first axiom of matter is break- 
down. From complexity to sim- 
plicity. This is the way of the 
world. We are born with fully 
developed, complex organs. We 
evolve to a simpler form, a lesser 
body, less well developed organs.

Eventually, we vanish sponta- 
neously — that’s total simplicity, 
or nothing.” 

Gan sighed. How true! Take 
numbers. You were born at 77 or 
78 and aged until you were five 
or six. Complexity to simplicity. 
How could you deny it? 

OUT once he had dared to deny 
it. Dr. Gan had postulated 
that there might be also a move- 
ment from simplicity to complex- 
ity. From, say, 1 to 100. From a 
person born as a simple-minded, 
tiny, underdeveloped body, aging 
to a complex old age with organs 
fully developed, and so on to 
death. This weird nonsense had 
gotten him thrown out of the 
Thurkian Academy of Science. 
It was just as well, he thought 
bitterly. For if, say. Earth hap- 
pened to fall in the simplicity- 
to-complexity pattern that he 
postulated, instead of Duk’s com- 
plexity to simplicity, then every- 
thing would have to be reversed. 

Jesse H. Smith, for instance, 
instead of being born in 1953 and 
aging to 1883 in the normal 
greater-to-lesser ratio as ordain- 
ed by nature, might have been 
born in 1883 and died in 1953, a 
lesser to a greater number. 

On this basis, Earthmen would 
not be immortal, and . 

Dr. Gan cringed. It was well 
that he had put all heresy behind 
him. It would completely upset 



not only Dr. Duk’s great extra- 
polation of Earth, but would 
snatch immortality away from 
the Thurkians. 

Still, it was odd that the pa- 
tient didn’t know his right side 
from his left. Gan would have to 
explore this. The next obvious 
question was to ask him in what 
direction the Sun rose on Earth. 
It rose in the west, of course, and 
traveled to the east, where it set. 
If he should maintain that it rose 
in the east and traveled to the 
west . 

Gan shuddered. In spite of 
himself, his mind began to ex- 
trapolate. 

He forced himself back to the 
task at hand. In just a few sec- 
onds, he had jumped the gap of 
communication with his patient. 
These wonderful Earthmen had 
obviously designed a hearing aid 
that not only carried sound, but 
was able to break down the 
thought intent into different lan- 
guages. Probably by coordinating 
like areas with like areas inside 
the brains of the people using it. 

Gan munched on an Earth car- 
rot, putting it carefully into his 
ear and biting simultaneously on 
his rubber eating disc which was 
fitted into his mouth. His sharp, 
young teeth bit into the rubber 
eating disc and his jaw moved. 
The motion was translated to the 
inner ear, where his tiny, invis- 
ible real teeth rotated in sympa-

thetic motion and chewed up the 
carrot. 

He made a pre-swallow and the 
carrot moved down his Eusta- 
chian tube to his mouth and the 
back of his throat, where the 
swallow proper could take place. 

He gulped in satisfaction, re- 
membering that the Earthman 
used his mouth directly for food 
and didn’t eat with his ears at 
all. An insignificant difference, 
but there were many differences 
to be taken into consideration, he 
was beginning to think. 

Dr. Gan bent close to the man’s 
ear, now convinced of its func- 
tion. At that moment the great 
interruption came. 

A N enormous crowd burst into 
the room. It was the great 
Dr. Duk along with the Princess 
of the People, the beautiful and 
glamorous Aza, smiling and 
charming as ever. 

Princess Aza was a dreamy 
creature, with a milk-white com- 
plexion and long red hair. She 
always wore a look of mild sur- 
prise which had carried her 
through many terms of office. 
One got the impression that, 
whatever was said to her, it was 
the first time she’d ever heard it. 
He noticed with sadness that she 
had aged. Now her breasts jutted 
firmly against her dress where, 
formerly, they had sagged en- 
trancingly. Her stomach had lost 



its alluring bulge and was 
shrunken flat. Her hips were 
roimder, her legs had slimmed 
and turned in at the ankles. Her 
skin, formerly full of the care- 
free wrinkles and blotches of 
youth, was unlined, smooth and 
clear as a dowager’s. Her eyes 
were no longer red-rimmed but 
showed white irises. 

Instead of reminding Gan of 
the careless irresponsibility of 
youth, she reminded him of sex, 
of alert physical hungers of old 
age. 

She graciously blew in his ear 
and he quivered at the perfumed 
smell of her and the affectionate 
feel of her being. He blew back 
gently and saw a shudder go over 
her figure. This ear-blowing rite 
could be dangerous in old age ! 

She graciously bent then and 
blew into the ear of the Earth- 
man in tribute to his great race. 
But with the ear-thing in, he 
obviously couldn’t feel it, so she 
leaned over to blow into his free 
ear. 

The man opened his mouth 
and bit the soft skin of her 
throat. Not exactly bit, but 
pursed his lips and brought them 
away from her skin with a 
smacking sound. 

The Thurkians looked at each 
other in horror and dismay. 

Then the voice of the great 
Duk filled the room. 

“We must remember that, on 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Earth, the inhabitants did not 
mean hatred as we do by mouth- 
pressing.” he rumbled. 

‘‘Their mouth-pressing serves 
a different function. From sev- 
eral visual images I have found, 
it is apparent that this gesture is 
merely a method of recognizing 
relatives. Earthmen were a great 
and glorious race, but they must 
have had poor sense of sight, be- 
cause they could not recognize 
their own intimates. They per- 
formed much mouth-pressing to 
see if the individual they bit at 
one day was the same one as they 
bit another day. We are fairly 
sure that they determined by the 
lip-feel whether or not they were 
related. 

‘‘This business occurred mostly 
between members of the opposite 
sexes. Apparently, it was a mis- 
erable and defeating function, of 
which they were ashamed, if the 
grimaces on their features before 
and after are to be accounted for. 
It seemed that this was the un- 
happiness of their lives, but each 
race has its weak spot.” 

^^HERE was spontaneous ap- 
plause at this minor bit of ex- 
trapolation. 

Gan remembered his own great 
days as an extrapolator and 
clapped too. ‘‘Of course,” he said 
aloud in his professional tone, as 
the applause died, ‘‘this extrapo- 
lation doesn’t account for the fact 



that the Earthman couldn’t pos- 
sibly be related to the Princess 
and therefore would have no mo- 
tive whatsoever for the mouth- 
pressing on her throat.” 

The Thurkians shifted uncom- 
fortably in an embarrassing si- 
lence, The Princess looked un- 
easily surprised. Dr. Duk, a tiny 
man — for he was older than Gan 
— stepped forward, weaving on 
the balls of his feet, and thrust 
his face at Gan. 

“This discredited attendant,” 
said Dr. Duk, “is full of much 
nonsense. 1 must point out that 
it is he who advanced the out- 
rageous simplicity-to-complexity 
theory. Whereas I am the one 
who has extrapolated the great 
immortality of the Earthmen and 
am about to give this invaluable 
gift to our race. Tomorrow night. 
I am going to pregnate the Prin- 
cess of the People and start the 
great rejuvenation of our race. In 
the face of all this, can we waste 
time listening to this pseudo- 
scientist?” 

The others clapped politely. 

The Princess looked sympa- 
thetically at Gan. They- had been 
classmates on Thurkia; she had 
been an ordinary student of poli- 
tics then — they were lifelong 
friends. 

"Still, it is odd that the Earth- 
man mouth-pressed me,” she 
said. “Perhaps Dr. Gan would 
care to extrapolate?”

All eyes in the room became 
fixed on him and he blushed. “I 
hardly need to do that, kind 
Princess. I have just discovered 
a device with which to communi- 
cate with the Earthman. We can 
ask him why.” 

There was a gasp around the 
room. 

Dr. Duk stared down at the 
hearing device attached to the 
patient. 

He made a quick examination 
and then turned to the people 
with a triumphant smile. 

“This fool Gan,” he said, “is 
trying to make the Earthman 
hear us through the ear. How 
stupid can you get? We are ex- 
actly like Earthmen, cell for cell; 
obviously, then, they listen just 
as we do, through the mouth and 
not through the ear. How could 
he hear through his ears — the 
ears we know are for eating?” 

“The Earthman eats with his 
mouth,” said Gan quietly. 

Dr. Duk looked annoyed. 
“Folly and more folly!” he cried. 
“Of course, we all know that the 
Earthman takes food into his 
mouth, but we also know that it 
travels to his ear to be chewed. 
His ears move, as do ours, when 
he eats.” 

Duk then stared triumphantly 
around the room. 

“Now, Princess,” he said when 
there were no further challenges, 
“we must hurry, for there is 



much to be done before the cere- 
mony tomorrow. The broadcast 
to Thurkia — the ceremonial arri- 
val of the oldest Thurkian we are 
going to plant in your immortal- 
ity. Let us leave this discredited 
man to his senile dreams.” 

S ADLY, Gan watched them go. 

He sat down forlornly by the 
testing blanket and held his head 
in his hands. Again he had made 
a spectacle of himself! 

Was it possible that the Thurk- 
ians didn’t want to know the truth 
about Earthmen? Was it possible 
that, satisfied with Duk’s extra- 
polation, they were fearful of its 
being upset? 

He turned grimly to the pa- 
tient. “Let us set up a code," he 
said through the ear-aid. “Blink 
one eye for yes, two blinks for 
no. Agreed?” 

The Earthman blinked once. 
“Blink both eyes at the same 
time for maybe — or I don’t 
know!” he said. “Then we will 
set up the alphabet. Now, let’s 
begin . .” 

The Earthman told him that 
he had kissed the Princess be- 
cause it was a sign of affection. 

Gan outlined the plans of the 
Thurkians, carefully explaining 
Dr. Duk’s extrapolation. “Now,” 
he asked, “is Duk correct?” 

Two blinks — no. 

Duk was wrong. Earthmen 
were not immortal. They lived 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



from simplicity to complexity. 
Their so-called birthgrounds were 
actually graveyards. 

Gan turned off the ear-aid, 
went to the window and looked 
down on the moon-bathed gar- 
dens of the hospital. The Thurk- 
ians had come so far in space, 
had hoped for so much! Now, 
only he knew that the great 
dream had become dust and 
ashes. 

In the course of a career, a 
scientist extrapolated and then 
went into the lab and tried out 
his ideas. The few that were cor- 
rect won fame, advanced the race. 
History was silent about those 
who were wrong. Truly, the truths 
of the Universe were almost un- 
bearable. 

Furthermore, the bearer of 
truth was often one who suffered. 
Gan remembered how Pod had 
received the double-T for explod- 
ing early notions of the humors 
and rightfully describing the cir- 
culation of the blood. Even ear- 
lier, there was Dr. Nok, who had 
received the double-T for over- 
turning the favored idea that their 
planet Thurkos was the center of 
the Universe. 

The double-T was a knife in- 
cision, deep down and crossways. 
One between the ribs near the 
heart, one in the abdomen. It was 
guaranteed to cause instant death 
and the Thurkian vanished in 
the spontaneity of his life’s end. 



It was just barely possible that 
he, Gan, might receive the dou- 
ble-T for snatching the Duk ex- 
trapolation away from the peo- 
ple. On Thurkia there was much 
excitement; parades — speeches — 
wild riots of happiness, with the 
spontaneity of death finally over- 
come. Duk was a great national 
hero. 

Yet the Princess Aza faced a 
horrible death under Duk’s knife 
if Gan’s interpretations of the 
Earthman’s answers were right. 
He signed. How could he let the 
Princess of the People die? 

G an checked out, turning his 
patient over to Mol. Instead 
of returning to his lonely tent at 
the edge of the hospital grounds, 
he sought out the great Dr. Duk, 
who lived in splendor on the 
tower floor of the remaining hos- 
pital wing. 

Gan was surprised that Duk 
admitted him so quickly, but he 
came directly to the point. “It 
would be possible for me to keep 
my mouth closed, retain what 
position and salary I have and 
let your erroneous extrapolation 
fall of its own weight,” he said. 
“However, there is our Princess to 
think of. The patient has given 
me the understanding that Earth- 
men are not immortal.” 

Duk smiled. “It is always a 
pleasure for one scientist to tell 
another he’s a fool, eh, Gan? This

is the real motive in coming here 
to see me, is it not?” 

‘‘The truth is always my 
study,” sighed Gan. 

Dr. Duk laughed and pulled a 
strange-looking machine over to 
the center of the room. “I now 
have evidence that my extra- 
polation is correct,” he said. “It’s 
so inconvertible that even a dim- 
witted idiot such as yourself can- 
not deny it. It is the visual image, 
on a machine, made by the 
Earthmen themselves.” 

"The Princess is here,” said 
an assistant. 

“I have asked the Princess to 
see this proof,” said Duk. “to set 
her completely at ease for tomor- 
row’s experiment. You may as 
well stay.” 

The Princess came in and took 
a comfortable place, while Duk 
covered the preparations for the 
showing with a few remarks. 

“I have now completed a 
comprehensive extrapolation of 
Earth’s history. Like our own 
planet, Earth began as a marvel- 
ously complex association of hu- 
mans known as a world-city. 
Then the world-city separated 
into world-countries during a war 
cycle, and continually divided 
into smaller and smaller units, as 
the Earthmen gave up complex 
machines and simplified their 
lives. They went through an in- 
dustrial cycle and, disgusted with 
smoky and dirty cities, gave them 



up to live on farms and in tiny 
towns. They had internal com- 
bustion engines in their time, as 
we’ve had. From these, they 
progressed to horses, slowing the 
pace of their lives in order to 
relax from neurotic pressures. 

“After that, they gave up great 
segments of land — whole conti- 
nents — to nature and withdrew to 
one segment known as Europe. 

“Ever flowering, they continued 
onward, giving up, over the cen- 
turies, mercantilism for religious 
monarchy, religious monarchy for 
feudal kingship. Large wars be- 
came small wars. Complex weap- 
ons were succeeded by simple 
swords and battle-axes. Ever they 
developed to the seats of their 
civilizations which they called 
Rome and finally the apex, 
Greece. 

“From this pinnacle, Man 
stared into great heights, as yet 
undreamed of. A whole globe 
covered with virginal growth. 
Massive animals, destined to 
grow tall enough to eat from tree- 
tops. Glaciers large enough to 
cover a third of their globe, to 
cool off the hot land . 

“But this was the future they 
never reached. It is portrayed as 
constructed drawings in dream- 
books of their future. Their own 
extrapolations. Somewhere, either 
slightly after a man called Ein- 
stein or slightly before a man 
called Homer, some radioactive

disease came along which inter- 
rupted their normalcy. We do not 
yet know exactly where, in terms 
of their years, we are at this mo- 
ment. But you can bank on its 
being in the period between those 
two men, and it makes not the 
slightest difference. Eventually I 
shall puzzle it all out.” 

A MID a polite scatter of ap- 
plause, the man who worked 
on the strange machine now 
raised his hand as if ready. 

“A sideline to their history 
was their pregnating,” continued 
Dr. Duk. “Now, here is the actual 
proof of Man’s immortality.” He 
signaled an assistant, the lights 
dimmed and the aliens watched a 
picture unreel on the white hos- 
pital walls. 

It show a masked man in white 
spanking a tiny, aged Earthman 
in an operating room. Then the 
man placed the little creature 
into the woman. Two men placed 
the woman on a portable bed 
and transported her to another 
room marked Labor, where she 
fussed and tossed. Then it showed 
her departure from the hospital 
with her smiling husband. It pic- 
tured her at home going about 
her daily tasks clumsily, with oc- 
casional visits to the doctor’s 
office to see that the immortality 
went well. Eventually, the woman 
achieved her normal, slim figure 
and the film ended with the cessa- 



tion of the human commentator’s 
voice, which held no meaning for 
the Thurkians. 

Dr. Duk sat back in pleasure as 
the lights came up again. The 
assistant extrapolators all clap- 
ped, and the delighted Princess 
blew in his ear. They all filed out 
of the room. 

Duk was the last to go, and 
he turned to Gan who had re- 
mained seated. “As for your un- 
mitigated, foul attempt to dis- 
credit me,” he said, pausing at the 
door, “it is beneath my notice. I 
shall not press charges. You may 
return to your half-mad Earth- 
man who, twisted by the years 
spent in his breathing machine, 
has become forgetful about his 
race’s great destiny. You can 
trade your mad extrapolations 
with each other. The blind lead- 
ing the blind! Good night. Dr. 
Gan." 

Gan sighed. Duk might be 
right about the patient’s madness. 
He hadn’t thought of that. 

Gan examined the projecting 
machine. The button had an ar- 
row that pointed to the hierogly- 
phics r-e-K-e-r-s-e. He snapped 
the button and turned on the 
machine again. The film ran 
backward, this time starting with 
the girl having a slim figure and 
ending in the delivery room. 

It made sense that way too, he 
thought. 

He was aware that someone 



THIS SIDE UP 



45 



else was in the room. A soft 
hand touched his arm. 

“It’s no use, dear friend,” said 
Princess Aza. “I came back to 
tell you I was sorry that you had 
gotten the worst part of the argu- 
ment. Now. I too have seen the 
correct images.” 

“If Duk is wrong and this se- 
quence is right, you know you 
die.” 

“I have thought of that. I have 
asked Dr. Duk to convince him- 
self by speaking with the Earth- 
man. But Duk is so seldom wrong 
that I am sure the Earthman is 
mad. No, tomorrow’s ceremony 
must take place, for I dare let no 
other woman claim the honor 
ahead of me. But I thank you for 
worrying over me, dear friend.” 

^^HEY awoke Gan sometime 
in the middle of the night. It 
was Tok who was leaning over the 
cot in Gan's lonely tent, across 
the grounds from the hospital, in 
the space reserved for underlings. 

Tok’s face was anxious. 
“There’s been a crisis at the hos- 
pital. The Princess of the People 
wants to see you at once.” 

Gan hurried across the grass 
past the white markers of the 
Earthmen’s birthplace for the 
second time within tv.'enty-four 
hours. He found the Princess agi- 
tated. 

“Our great Dr. Duk,” she gasp- 
ed. “He is dying. The Earthman 



— he was responsible. Please go 
there at once and see what it’s 
all about. Everyone around me 
seems to have a different story, 
but I know I can trust you, old 
friend.” 

Gan hurried to the Earthman’s 
room. A Thurkian blade pro- 
truded from the patient’s chest 
in an incomplete double-T. The 
man’s face was shiny with sweat. 
Gan realized at once that Earth’s 
last survivor was going to die. 
He smiled weakly at Gan and 
made a friendly gesture with his 
finger. 

Duk, he revealed — using the 
eye code with much prompting 
from Gan — had come to him and 
used the same code. Duk was un- 
der the impression that Gan was 
using the Earthman, and was 
worried that the last Earthman 
would accept the Gan extrapo- 
lation against the massive evi- 
dence of his own great work. 
And, since it worried the Prin- 
cess of the People, Dr. Duk tried 
to force the patient to recant. 

The Earthman had refused to 
support Dr. Duk and had in- 
sisted that Gan was right. Where- 
upon, Duk had switched off the 
breathing apparatus of the pa- 
tient's machine. Without his iron 
lung, he could not live more than 
a few moments. In fear of his life, 
writhing in suffocation, the Earth- 
man had had to wink assent and 
Dr. Duk had turned on the ma- 



46 



oalaxy science fiction 



chine again. But the patient had 
realized that Duk’s intention 
— in his mistaken notion — to 
immortalize a great many Thur- 
kians could only end in death 
and horror. 

Therefore, he had asked Duk 
to bring a certain box of pills to 
him from the testing blanket. 
These pills, the Earthman had 
told Duk, were language pills. By 
taking them, Duk would instant- 
ly understand Earth’s language 
and would be able to impress the 
people of Thurkia with his knowl- 
edge. 

Duk gulped the pills greedily. 
They came in a box marked with 
the hieroglyphics s-t-r-y-c-h- 
n-/-n-e. Almost immediately Duk 
realized he’d been tricked. He 
barely had time to plunge the 
knife into the human’s chest be- 
fore he had been overcome. 

^RIMLY, Gan hurried to the 
Princess and told her of 
Duk’s perfidy. He asked her to 
return with him to the patient’s 
room and they were at the door 
when Mol brought them word on 
Dr. Duk. 

“He died,” said Mol, “bravely. 
He disappeared in a genteel way, 
turning into a bright, pink cloud 
and atomizing with all of the 
dignity of his greatness. He will 
be long remembered.” 

“He will be remembered,” said 
Gan. 



Inside the room, they found a 
small group staring at the pa- 
tient with awe. 

“He has died,” whispered Tok. 
“But see — watch what the ma- 
chine does!” 

The dead Earthman lay on the 
bed. Relays clicked, lights flash- 
ed. Presently, the complicated 
breathing apparatus was lifted 
away from the body. 

“Now we shall see a strange 
thing,” cried Tok. “Perhaps even 
the Earthman’s immortality by 
machinery in some kind of spe- 
cial form.” 

“I doubt it.” said Gan dryly. 

One side of the bed rose. A 
container beneath the bed open- 
ed. Two metal arms of great size 
extended a box. The Thurkians 
gasped in wonder as the body slid 
from the bed and was gently low- 
ered into the box, which had a 
plush interior, and was six feet 
long, three feet wide. The lid 
closed and with a great deal of 
decorum, the box disappeared 
through a trap door in the floor. 

Gan turned to his fellow Thur- 
kians. “This proves beyond a 
doubt my own extrapolation,” he 
said. “That box called a coffin 
is now to be placed in what Dr. 
Duk erroneously called the birth- 
grounds, but which are really the 
graveyards of the Earthmen, sig- 
nifying the end, not the begin- 
ning of their lives. They lived 
from simplicity to complexity,

after all. and. like us, didn’t have 
immortality.” 

”TT was a great thing to have 
held resolutely and firmly to 
your theory when all those 
around you jeered,” said the 
Princess of the People. “It was a 
great thing to have stood against 
a man of Dr. Duk’s reputation 
and won out in the end.” 

Gan waved a deprecatory 
hand. “More important, you, my 
dear Princess, are still living.” 
The Princess, as usual, looked 
surprised. But it was evident she 
had something else on her mind. 
“Speaking of resolutions,” she 
said, “it is now my time to do 
service to Thurkia by marrying 
and having children.” 

Gan felt his heart beat faster. 
“I have therefore appointed 
you Acting Chief Extrapolator 
of Thurkia. a position of promi- 
nence. And — if you care to — if 
you wish to — mate with a suit- 
able Princess, I mean . .” 

The Princess blushed in con- 
fusion. They were standing on 
a hospital balcony under the 
soft, quiet moonlight of Earth. 

Gan extrapolated rapidly and 
caught her meaning. “Princess,” 
he said, gulping. “Will you marry 
me?” 

“Why, Gan!” she said, laugh- 
ing in embarrassment. “Why, 
Gan. I didn’t think you cared. 
Why — it is just possible that I 



will, though you catch me en- 
tirely by surprise.” 

He cut off her stammering 
with loving blows in her ear. 

Then they faced each other 
and the Thurkian Princess of the 
People, after making a cere- 
monious sign, turned her back 
and bent over. Gan kicked her. 

And when she in turn had kick- 
ed him, it was formally sealed. 
There was no turning back now, 
for once the love-kick is placed, 
the couple are married. This 
Thurkian ritual establishes the 
tender, serious finale to courtship 
and the gateway to married life. 

And the Moon shone on the

CLOSEUP OF MARS 



T he science news releases 
you’ll find in the daily 
papers by the time this is- 
sue appears on the newsstands 
will probably say that Mars can 
be seen as a brilliant red object 
in the constellation Sagittarius, 
the Archer. I have a suspicion 
that it will work the other way 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



round for most people — they’ll 
see a conspicuous bright reddish 
star in the southern sky and, 
having read the news releases, 
will conclude that the other stars 
around it must be the constella- 
tion of Sagittarius. 

This is one of the years when 
Mars is in “opposition,” which 
simply means that it finds itself 
along a line drawn from the Sun 
through the Earth. 

Astronomers are ready for the 
event. Every observatory has al- 
loted telescope time to Mars dur- 
ing those four weeks from the 
middle of June to the middle of 
July. The National Geographic 
Society, in combination with the 
Lowell Observatory of Flagstaff, 
Arizona, has sent a team of 
astronomers to Bloemfontein in 
South Africa to obtain a coordi- 
nated photographic study from a 
point in the southern hemisphere. 
The planet will be photographed 
from high-flying aircraft and 
there has even been some hopeful 
talk about expending a high-alti- 
tude research missile or two. 

A CTUALLY, an opposition of 
Mars is not precisely a rare 
event. Since the Earth needs 
365^ days to go around the Sun 
once and Mars needs 687 days to 
do the same, the two planets must 
pass each other, with the faster 
Earth overtaking the slower Mars 
at regular intervals. 



What this interval must be is 
comparatively easy to calculate. 
The Earth, as seen from the Sun, 
moves through just about one de- 
gree of arc per day, since a full 
circle has 360 degrees. The exact 
figure for the movement of the 
Earth is 59 minutes and 48.2 sec- 
onds of arc. The planet Mars, 
also as seen from the Sun, moves 
about half a degree of arc per 
day, the exact figure being 31 
minutes and 26.5 seconds of arc. 

If we express this average 
movement in seconds of arc, the 
Earth covers 3548.2 per day and 
Mars 1886.5 per (Earth) day. The 
Earth, therefore, gains 1661.7 
seconds of arc per day. 

With this figure available, the 
question “when will the Earth 
catch up with Mars again” be- 
comes a simple division. There 
are 360 times 60 times 60 seconds 
of arc in a full circle; dividing this 
by the daily gain of 1661.7, we ob- 
tain 779.92 days or 2 years and 
49.42 days. Therefore, there is an 
opposition of Mars every 2 years 
and 50 days. 

Well, then, if that is the case, 
why is there so much shouting 
about this opposition of 1954 and 
the one to come in 1956? The 
answer, so to speak, is that all 
girls are not equally pretty and 
one loaf of bread is not neces- 
sarily as good as another. The 
oppositions differ in quality be- 
cause the orbit of Mars is a

of the Earth at the change of the seasons. Perihelion and aphelion of 
Earth are indicated by the letters P and A at broken lines. The arrow 
points to the position of this year's opposition. A number of other oppo- 
sitions are indicated by the dated lines connecting the orbits of the two 
planets. Some of the minimum distances during past oppositions were: 1924 
(Aug. 24) 34,637,000 miles; 1941 (Oct. 10) 38,500,000; 1948 (Feb. 18)

rather pronounced ellipse. 

At the ijoint of its orbit closest 
to the Sun — the perihelion — the 
distance Sun-Mars is 128 mil- 
lion miles. At the point of its 
orbit farthest from the Sun — the 
aphelion — the distance Sun-Mars 
measures 155 million miles. Since 
the orbit of the Earth is far more 
circular, there is obviously a dif- 
ference between an opposition oc- 
curring when Mars is at, or near, 
its perihelion and an opposition 



that occurs when Mars is near its 
aphelion. The opposition of 1924 
was almost precisely a “peri- 
helion opposition” while the one 
of 1948 was very nearly an 
“aphelion opposition.” 

Now the orbit of the Earth is 
not circular, either. When Earth 
is at its perihelion, the distance 
to the Sun is 91,341,000 miles. 
When Earth is at aphelion, the 
distance is 94,450,000 miles, a 
difference of slightly over three

million miles. For the sake of 
getting a good look at Mars, one 
could only wish that Earth’s 
aphelion were in the same direc- 
tion from the Sun as the peri- 
helion of Mars. To some extent, 
this is really the casfe. At least the 
Earth is still on that portion of 
its orbit which is farther from 
the Sun than average when it 
passes the perihelion of Mars. 

This year’s opposition, inci- 
dentally, will take place almost 
when Earth is at aphelion, al- 
though Mars is still a long way 
from its perihelion. The distance 
between the two planets is going 
to be about 40,300,000 miles. At 
the next opposition, on Septem- 
ber 11. 1956, the distance will be 
about the shortest it can be, 
namely 35,400,000 miles. 

^T^HOUGH a perihelion opposi- 
tion is obviously “better” 
than an aphelion opposition, 
astronomers do not neglect the 
latter by any means. In addition 
to what might be called general 
principles, there are two good spe- 
cific reasons. One is that, to ob- 
servatories in the northern hemi- 
sphere of the Earth, Mars is 
higher up in the sky when Earth 
is near its perihelion. This also 
explains the value of the team 
working at Bloemfontein this 
year. The other is connected with 
the position of the Martian axis 
of rotation. 



Like that of the Earth, the axis 
of Mars does not stand vertically 
on the plane of its orbit. In the 
case of our own planet, there is 
the well-known inclination of 
23* 27'. The figure for Mars 
reads very much alike — 24* 52'. 

But while the Earth’s axis, at 
aphelion, is inclined toward the 
Sun, so that our North Polar 
regions have summer at that time, 
the axis of Mars, near Martian 
perihelion, is inclined away from 
the Sun. The two axes may be 
said to form a V and at a peri- 
helion opposition, the Martian 
South Pole is in the light of the 
Sun, has summer, and is visible to 
us. The Martian North Pole is in 
darkness and we can’t see it at 
all. 

Obviously, then, our only 
chance to observe the Martian 
North Polar regions is when Mars 
is at the other side of its orbit — 
that is, during an aphelion op- 
position. Naturally the position 
of Mars’ axis varies as little as 
ours; it always points to the same 
spot in space in the course of a 
Martian year. It so happens that 
there is no conspicuous star near 
either of the celestial poles of 
Mars. The “Martians,” therefore, 
have neither a northern nor a 
southern Pole Star. 

Just as the inclination of the 
Martian axis happens to be quite 
similar but slightly larger than 
ours, so the Martian day happens 



52 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to be slightly longer than ours. 
It is 24 hours, 37 minutes and 
about 22^ seconds. (The most 
precise recent figure published 
gives 24h 37' and 22.6679".) This 
difference between the terrestrial 
and the Martian day, incidental- 
ly, is within the adjustment pe- 
riod of a good watch, so that

explorers could use ordinary 
watches during their stay on 
Mars. 

Because the Martian day is 
slightly longer than the Earth 
day, the Martian year, 687 Earth 



days long, has only 668.6 days as 
experienced by somebody on 
Mars. 

A S has just been mentioned, a 
good watch could be adjust- 
ed to the slightly longer Martian 
day. But an exploring party 
would not only like to know the 
Martian time, they would also 
like to know what time it is in 
Los Angeles, New York, London 
or Berlin or wherever they hap- 
pen to come from. Beyond that, 
since the slightly longer Martian 
day tends to creep more and more 
into an Earth “tomorrow,” they 
would have to have means of 
keeping track of the terrestrial 
calendar as well as of their own. 
Such a device is no longer a 
gadget of the future. 

Rushing events a bit, Dr. I. M. 
Levitt, director of the Pels 
Planetarium, has designed a 
clock which shows both Earth 
and Martian time on two 24-hour 
dials and keeps track of the cal- 
endars as well. The two 24-hour 
days present no difficulties and 
the Earth calendar, obsolescent 
and rickety as it is, is at least 
familiar. But there were some dif- 
ficulties with the Martian calen- 
dar. Dividing the Martian year 
into 12 months, you get eight 
months of 55 (Martian, of 
course) days each and four 
months of 56 days each. But at 
the end of the year you have 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



53 





6/ 10th of a day left over, which 
is worse than the dangling quar- 
ter-day at the end of an Earth 
year. 

To accommodate those 6/lOth 
of a Martian day, the Martian 
calendar has to run in 5-year pe- 
riods, the first and last of these 
five years being “short years” 
with 668 days, the other three 
“normal years” with 669 days 
and a 57th of December. This 
arrangement differs from astro- 
nomical reality by 0.0019 days 
per year and, to take care of the 
difference, every 500th year will 
have to lose a day. Even then, 
there is still a tiny difference, but 
it would take a full 10,000 years 
to accumulate to a full day. 

Well, to get down to Earth: 
The conspicuous reddish star you 
see in the southern sky is Mars, 
the “red and green planet,” as 
Dr. Hubertus Strughold called it. 
About a year from now, there 
might be something new about it 
to tell. 

THE INNER PLANETS 

I HAVE a letter from Bill Cour- 
val of 741 Isthmus Ct. in San 
Diego, California, asking a ques- 
tion about which others may have 
wondered, too. on occasion. The 
letter reads: “Since we face away 
from the Sun at night, why is it 
that the two inner planets are 
visible to us?” The answer is. 



of course, that the two inner 
planets Mercury and Venus are 
not visible at night, but only in 
the morning and evening hours 
before sunrise and after sunset, 
respectively. 

The diagram shows that, seen 
from the Earth, the farthest Mer- 
cury can be from the Sun is 
about 27 degrees of arc, while 
Venus can be as much as 48 de- 
grees of arc from the Sun. 

If we imagine that both planets 
happen to be simultaneously in 
this especially favorable position 
(“extreme elongation” is the tech- 
nical term), Venus would rise 
48’’ ahead of the Sun and Mer- 
cury 27“ ahead of the Sun in the 
morning. 

The rotation of the Earth 
amounts to 15 degrees of arc 
per hour, which makes the ap- 
parent movement of the Sun 
across the sky 15“ per houi. 
Therefore, the Sun would app>ear 
at the horizon just about three 
hours after Venus did. 

But the sky begins to light up 
when the Sun is still some 18“ 
below the horizon, so that the 
period during which the planets 
could be clearly visible against a 
dark sky is shortened by about 
one hour. Venus happens to be 
luminous enough to show up 
brightly even against a fairly 
light sky. Mercury is less lumin- 
ous to begin with. It is also much 
smaller and farther away, so that 



54 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




it soon fades in a brightening 
morning sky. For this reason, the 
period during which Mercury can 
be seen with the naked eye, even 
under very favorable circum- 
stances, is hardly longer than 
half an hour. 

Another and rare opportunity 
to see the inner planets is in the 
daylight sky during a total eclipse 
of the Sun. With a telescope, they 
can be seen at any time while 
they are above the hori2on,

Probably the first astronomer to

The idea was once treated 
very seriously in a German 
work on higher mathematics as 
a mathematical concept, but 
since the only application of 
this concept so far is in science 
fiction, it might be better to 
stick to literature. 

What may have been the first 



literary example was a story 
written by a gentleman by the 
name of Winston Churchill, 
several decades before he be- 
came Sir Winston. The title of 
the story was If Lee Had Lost at 
Gettysburg. Of course he did 
lose, but the story pretended to 
have heen written in a world 
where Lee won' the battle of 
Gettysburg and the author had 
a scholar there try to figure out 
how the world would look if 
Lee had lost. 

In other words, the concept 
makes the assumption that 
there is one world where the 
Confederates won and one 
where the Confederates were 
defeated. Likewise, there is one 
worhl where the American 
Colonies seceded from the Brit- 
ish Empire and another world 
where they did not. Also a 
world in which Martin Luther 
did what he did and another 
one in which he was elected 
Pope. One in which Lenin over- 
threw the Kerenski government 
and one in which the train in 
which he traveled through Ger- 
many was derailed and Lenin 
perished in the accident. One in 
which the Allies came first with 
the atom homb and one in 
which Heisenberg did. 

In short, every important 
turning point in history pro- 
duces— in theory — not a “new” 
world, but two.

Since li^ht is known to exert 
pressure on small objects, it also 
should cause “thrust" at its 
source. This probably would not 
work in the afmosp/iere, but could 
we build a “light-beam rocket" 
once space has been reached? 
You could not ask for a higher 
exhaust velocity than that of 
light, could you? 

Lt. Edward O. Olney 

RCAF

I agree on two counts: (A) 
that a light l>eam would be a 
propulsive force and (B) that 
everybody would be satisfied 
with an exhaust velocity of 
186,000 miles per second. Un- 
fortunately, exhaust velocity 
alone doesn't do it. There has to 
he some mass and there is also 
the question of efficiency in- 
volved, at which point the ratio 
between exhaust velocity and 
rocket velocity enters the pic- 
ture. It so happens that two 
specific examples of a ^^light- 
beam drive" were worked out 
by T. F. Reinhardt of the U. S. 
Naval Air Rocket Test Station 
at Lake Denmark, New Jersey, 
for a lecture at the Annual 
Meeting of the American 
Rocket Society in Atlantic City 
in 1951. 

To obtain a thrust of one 



pound from a light beam, one 
would need 1,330,000 kilowatts 
— which is just about the elec- 
trical power output of Niagara 
Falls! A medium-sized research 
rocket would have to have a 
thrust of 10,000 lbs. So the cur- 
rent to be fed to the light 
source would have to be a 
current of a nice round million 
amperes at an astronomical 
13.3 million volts. 

(Reinhardt added, incidental- 
ly, that a conductor for a one- 
million-ampere current would 
have to have a diameter of 
about 20 inches if made of cop- 
per and would weigh 1200 
pounds per foot.) 

If the light source had an 
area of one square foot, its 
temperature would have to be 
1,620,000 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Naturally, you will want to limit 
the temperature of the light 
source to a practical figure, per- 
haps 10,000 degrees Fahren- 
heit. In that case, the area of 
the light source would have to 
have an area of 60 acres! All 
this for 10,000 lbs. of thrust, 
which one might obtain by 
burning 65 lbs. of fuel per 
second. 

I suggest we go on using light 
for illumination only.

GREEN THUMB 

By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 

A county agent has a tough enough /ob— he 
shouMn't also have to act as unsuspecting 
and unrecognized ambassador for all Earth! 



I HAD come back from lunch 
and was watching the office 
while Millie went out to get 
a bite to eat. With my feet up on 
the desk in a comfortable posi- 
tion. I was giving considerable 
attention to how I might outwit 
a garbage-stealing dog. 

The dog and I had carried on 
a feud for months and I was 
about ready to resort to some 
desperate measures. 

I had blocked up the can with 



heavy concrete blocks so he 
couldn’t tip it over, but he was 
a big dog and could stand up 
and reach down into the can and 
drag all the garbage out. I had 
tried putting a heavy weight on 
the lid, but he simply dragged it 
off and calmly proceeded with 
his foraging. I had waited up 
and caught him red-handed at it 
and heaved some rocks and what- 
ever else was handy at him, but 
he recognized tactics such as 



Illustrated by FIEMINGER 



58 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



these for what they were and 
they didn’t bother him. He’d 
come back in half an hour, calm 
as ever. 

I had considered setting a light 
muskrat trap on top of the gar- 
bage so that, when he reached 
down into the can, he’d get his 
muzzle caught. But if I did that, 
sure as hell I’d forget to take it 
out some Tuesday morning and 
the garbageman would get caught 
instead. I had toyed with the 
idea of wiring the can so the 
dog would get an electric shock 
when he came fooling around. 
But I didn’t know how to go 
about wiring it and, if I did, ten 
to one I’d fix it up so I’d electro- 
cute him instead of just scaring 
him off, and I didn’t want to 
kill him. 

I like dogs, you understand. 
That doesn’t mean I have to like 
all dogs, does it? And if you had 
to scrape up garbage every morn- 
ing, you’d be just as sore at the 
mutt as I was. 

W HILE I was wondering if 
I couldn’t put something in 
a particularly tempting bit of 
garbage that would make him 
sick and still not kill him, the 
phone rang. 

It was old Pete Skinner out on 
Acorn Ridge. 

“Could you come out?” he 
asked. 



“Maybe,” I said. “What you 
got?" 

“I got a hole out in the north 
forty.” 

“Sink-hole?” 

“Nope. Looks like someone 
dug it out and carried off the 
dirt.” 

“Who would do that, Pete?” 
“I don’t know. And that ain’t 
all of it. They left a pile of sand 
beside the hole.” 

“Maybe that’s what they dug 
out of the hole.” 

“You know well enough,” said 
Pete, “that I haven’t any sandy 
soil. You’ve run tests enough on 
it. All of mine is clay.” 

“I’ll be right out,” I told him. 
A county agent gets some 
funny calls, but this one topped 
them all. Hog cholera, corn bor- 
ers, fruit blight, milk production 
records — any of these would 
have been down my alley. But a 
hole in the north forty? 

And yet. I suppose I should 
have taken it as a compliment 
that ,Pete called me. When 
you’ve been a county agent for 
fifteen years, a lot of farmers 
get to trust you and some of 
them, like Pete, figure you can 
straighten out any problem. I 
enjoy a compliment as much as 
anybody. It’s the headaches that 
go with them that I don’t like. 

When Millie came back, I 
drove out to Pete’s place, which 



GREEN THUMB 



59 



is only four or five miles out of 
town. 

Pete’s wife told me that he 
was up in the north forty, so I 
went there and found not only 
Pete, but some of his neighbors. 
All of them were looking at the 
hole and doing a lot of talking. I 
never saw a more puzzled bunch 
of people. 

The hole was about 30 feet in 
diameter and about 35 feet deep, 
an almost perfect cone — not the 
kind of hole you’d dig with a 
pick and shovel. The sides were 
.cut as clean as if they’d been 
machined, but the soil was not 
compressed, as it would have 
been if machinery had been used. 

The pile of sand lay just a 
short distance from the hole. 
Looking at it, I had the insane 
feeling that, if you shoveled that 
sand into the hole, it would ex- 
actly fit. It was the whitest sand 
I’ve ever seen and, when I walk- 
ed over to the pile and picked up 
some of it, I saw that it was 
clean. Not just ordinary clean, 
but absolutely clean — as though 
laundered grain by grain. 

I stood around for a while, 
like the rest of them, staring at 
the hole and the pile of sand and 
wishing I could come up with 
some bright idea. But I wasn’t 
able to. There was the hole and 
there was the sand. The topsoil 
was dry and powdery and would 



have shown wheelmarks or any 
other kind if there’d been any. 
There weren’t. 

T TOLD Pete maybe he’d better 
fence in the whole business, 
because the sheriff or somebody 
from the state, or even the uni- 
versity, might want to look it 
over. Pete said that was a good 
idea and he’d do it right away. 

I went back to the farmhouse 
and asked Mrs. Skinner to give 
me a couple of fruit jars. One 
of them I filled with a sample 
from the sand pile and the other 
with soil from the hole, being 
careful not to jolt the walls. 

By this time, Pete and a 
couple of the neighbors had got- 
ten a wagonload of fence posts 
and some wire and were coming 
out to the field. I waited and 
helped unload the posts and 
wire, then drove back to the of- 
fice, envying Pete. He was satis- 
fied to put up the fence and let 
me worry about the problem. 

I found three fellows waiting 
for me. I gave Millie the fruit 
jars and asked her to send them 
right away to the Soils Bureau 
at the State Farm Campus. 
Then I settled down to work. 

Other people drifted in and it 
was late in the afternoon before 
I could call up the Soils Bu- 
reau and tell them I wanted the 
contents of the two jars analyz- 



60 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ed. I told them a little of what 
had happened, although not all 
of it for, when you tried to put 
it into words, it sounded pretty 
weird. 

“Banker Stevens called and 
asked if you’d drop by his place 
on your way home,” Millie told 
me. 

“What would Stevens want 
with me?” I asked. “He isn’t a 
farmer and I don’t owe him any 
money.” 

“He grows fancy flowers,” said 
Millie. 

“I know that. He lives just up 
the street from me.” 

“From what I gathered, some- 
thing awful happened to them. 
He was all broken up.” 

So, on the way home, I stop- 
ped at the Stevens place. The 
banker was out in the yard, wait- 
ing for me. He looked terrible. 
He led me around to the big 
flower garden in the back and 
never have I seen such utter dev- 
astation. In that whole area, 
there wasn’t a single plant alive. 
Every one of them had given up 
the ghost and was lying wilted 
on the ground. 

“What could have done it. 
Joe?” asked Stevens and, the 
way he said it, I felt sorry for 
him. 

After all, those flowers were a 
big thing in his life. He’d raised 
them from special seed and he’d 



babied them along, and for any- 
body who is crazy about flowers, 
I imagine they were tops. 

“Someone might have used 
some spray on them,” I said. “Al- 
most any kind of spray, if you 
didn’t dilute it enough, would 
kill them.” 

in the garden, I took a 
close look at the dead flow- 
ers, but nowhere could I see any 
sign of the burning from too 
strong a spray. 

Then I saw the holes, at first 
only two or three of them, then, 
as I went on looking, dozens of 
them. They were all over the 
garden, about an inch in dia- 
meter, for all the world as if 
someone had taken a broomstick 
and punched holes all over the 
place. I got down on my knees 
and could see that they tapered, 
the way they do when you pull 
weeds with big taproots out of 
the ground. 

“You been pulling weeds?” 

I asked. 

“Not big ones like that,” said 
the banker. “I take good care of 
those flowers, Joe. You know* 
that. Keep them weeded and 
watered and cultivated and 
sprayed. Put just the right 
amount of commercial fertilizer 
in the soil. Try to keep it at top 
fertility.” 

“You should use manure. It’s

better than all the commercial 
fertilizer you can buy.” 

“I don’t agree with you. Tests 
have proved ...” 

It was an old argument, one 
that we fought out each year. I 
let him run on, only half listen- 
ing to him, while I picked up 
some of the soil and crumbled 
it. It was dead soil. You could 
feel that it was. It crumbled at 
the lightest touch and was dry, 
even when I dug a foot beneath 
the surface. 

“You water this bed recent- 
ly?” I asked. 

“Last evening,” Stevens said. 

“When did you find the flowers 
like this?” 

“This morning. They looked 
fine last night. And now — ” he 
blinked fast. 

I asked him for a fruit jar and 
filled it with a sample of the 
soil. 

“I’ll send this in and see if 
there’s anything wrong with it,” 
I said. 

A bunch of dogs were barking 
at something in the hedge in 
front of my place when I got 
home. Some of the dogs in the 
neighborhood are hell on cats. 
I parked the car and picked up 
an old hoe handle and went out 
to rescue the cat they seemed to 
have cornered. 

They scattered when they saw 
me coming and I started to look 



in the hedge for the cat. There 
wasn’t any and that aroused my 
curiosity and I wondered what 
the dogs could have been bark- 
ing at. So I went hunting. 

And I found it. 

TT was lying on the ground, 
^ close against the lower growth 
of the hedge, as if it had crawled 
there for protection. 

I reached in and pulled it out 
— a weed of some sort, about five 
feet tall, and with a funny root 
system. There were eight roots, 
each about an inch in diameter 
at the top and tapering to a 
quarter inch or so. They weren’t 
all twisted up, but were sort of 
sprung out, so that there were 
four to the side, each set of four 
in line. I looked at their tips and 
I saw that the roots were not 
broken off, but ended in blunt, 
strong points. 

The stalk, at the bottom, was 
about as thick as a man’s fist. 
There were four main branches 
covered with thick, substantial, 
rather meaty leaves; but the last 
foot of the branches was bare of 
leaves. At the top were several 
flower or seed pouches, the big- 
gest of them about the size of an 
old-fashioned coffee mug. 

I squatted there looking at it. 
The more I looked, the more 
puzzled I became. As a county 
agent, you have to know quite

a bit about botany and this plant 
was like none I had seen before. 

I dragged it actoss the lawn 
to the toolshed back of the ga- 
rage and tossed it in there, figur- 
ing that after supper I’d have a 
closer look at it 

I went in the house to get my 
evening meal ready and decided 
to broil a steak and fix up a bowl 
of salad. 

A lot of people in town wonder 
at my living in the old home- 
stead, but I’m used to the house 
and there seemed to be no sense 
in moving somewhere else when 
all it costs me is taxes and a little 
upkeep. For several years before 
Mother died, she had been quite 
feeble and I did all the cleaning 
and helped with the cooking, so 
I’m fairly handy at it. 

After I washed the dishes. I 
read what little there was to read 
in the evening paper and then 
looked up an old text on botany, 
to see if I could find anything 
that might help identify the 
plant. 

I didn’t find anything and. 
just before I went to bed. I got 
a flashlight and went out, ima- 
gining, I suppose, that I’d find 
the weed somehow different than 
I remembered it. 

I opened the door of the shed 
and flashed the light where I’d 
tossed the weed on the floor. 
At first, I couldn’t see it. then I 



heard a leafy rustling over in one 
corner and I turned the light 
in that direction. 

The weed had crawled over 
to one corner and it was trying 
to get up, its stem bowed out — 
the way a man would arch his 
back — pressing against the wall 
of the shed. 

OTANDING there with my 
^ mouth open, watching it try 
to raise itself erect, I felt horror 
and fear. I reached out to the 
corner nearest the door and 
snatched up an axe. 

If the plant had succeeded in 
getting up, I might have chop- 
ped it to bits. But, as I stood 
there, I saw the thing would never 
make it. I was not surprised 
when it slumped back on the 
floor. 

What I did next was just as 
unreasoning and instinctive as 
reaching for the axe. 

I found an old washtub and 
half filled it with water. Then I 
picked up the plant — it had a 
squirmish feel to it, like a worm 
— stuck its roots into the water, 
and pushed the tub back against 
the wall, so the thing could be 
braced upright. 

I went into the house and ran- 
sacked a couple of closets until 
I found the sunlamp I’d bought 
a couple of years back, to use 
when I had a touch of arthritis 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



in my shoulder. I rigged up the 
lamp and trained it on the plant, 
not too close. Then I got a big 
shovelful of dirt and dumped it 
in the tub. 

And that. I figured, was about 
all I could do. I was giving the 
plant water, soil-food and simu- 
lated sunlight. I was afraid that, 
if I tried a more fancy treatment, 
I might kill it, for I hadn’t any 
notion of what conditions it might 
be used to. 

Apparently I handled it right. 
It perked up considerably and, 
as I moved about, the coffee-cup- 
sized pod on the top kept turn- 
ing, following every move I made. 

I watched it for a while and 
moved the sunlamp back a little, 
so there’d be no chance of scorch- 
ing it, and went back into the 
house. 

It was then that I really began 
to get bone-scared. I had been 
frightened out in the shed, of 
course, but that had been shock. 
Now, thinking it over, I began 
to understand more clearly what 
sort of creature I’d found under- 
neath the hedge. I remember I 
wasn’t yet ready to say it out 
loud, but it seemed probable that 
my guest was an alien intelli- 
gence. 

I did some wondering about 
how it had gotten here and if it 
had made the holes in Banker 
Stevens’ flowerbed and also if it 
could have had anything to do 



with the big hole out in Pete 
Skinner’s north forty. 

I sat around, arguing with my- 
self, for a man just does not go 
prowling around in his neighbor’s 
garden after midnight. 

But I had to know. 

I WALKED up the alley to the 
back of the Stevens house 
and sneaked into the garden. 
Shielding the flashlight with my 
hat, I had another look at the 
holes in the ruined flowerbed. I 
wasn’t too surprised when I saw 
that they occurred in series of 
eight, four to the side — exactly 
the kind of holes the plant back 
in my toolshed would make if it 
sank its roots into the ground. 

I counted at least eleven of 
those eight-in-line sets of holes 
and I’m sure that there were 
more. But I didn’t want to stick 
around too long, for fear Banker 
Stevens might wake up and ask 
questions. 

So I went back home, down 
the alley, and was just in time to 
catch that garbage-stealing dog 
doing a good job on the can. He 
had his head stuck clear down 
into it and I was able to sneak 
up behind him. He heard me and 
struggled to get out, but he’d 
jammed himself into the can. Be- 
fore he could get loose, I landed 
a good swift kick where it did 
maximum good. He set some kind 
of canine speed record in getting 



GREEN THUMB

off the premises, I imagine. 

I went to the toolshed and 
opened the door. The tub half full 
of muddy water was still there 
and the sunlamp was still burn- 
ing — but the plant was gone. I 
looked all over the shed and 
couldn’t find it. So I unplugged 
the sunlamp and headed for the 
house. 

To be truthful, I was a little 
relieved that the plant had wan- 
dered off. 

But when I rounded the corner 
of the house, I saw it hadn’t. It 
was in the window box, and the 
geraniums I had nursed all spring 
were hanging limply over the side 
of the box. 

I stood there and looked at it 
and had the feeling that it was 
looking back at me. 

And I remembered that not 
only had it had to travel from 
the toolshed to the house and 
then climb into the window box, 
but it had had to open the tool- 
shed door and close it again. 

It was standing up, stiff and 
straight, and appeared to be in 
the best of health. It looked thor- 
oughly incongruous in the win- 
dow box — as if a man had grown 
a tall stalk of corn there, although 
it didn’t look anything like a 
stalk of corn. 

I got a pail of water and pour- 
ed it into the window box. Then 
I felt something tapping me on 
the head and looked up. The 



plant had bent over and was pat- 
ting me with one of its branches. 
The modified leaf at the end of 
the branch had spread itself out 
to do the patting and looked 
something like a hand. 

I went into the house and up 
to bed and the main thing I was 
thinking about was that, if the 
plant got too troublesome or dan- 
gerous, all I had to do was mix 
a strong dose of commercial fer- 
tilizer or arsenic, or something 
just as deadly, and water it with 
the mixture. 

Believe it or not, I went to 
sleep. 

I^EXT morning, I got to think- 
^ ^ ing that maybe I should re- 
pair the old greenhouse and put 
my guest in there and be sure to 
keep the door locked. It seemed 
to be reasonably friendly and in- 
offensive. but I couldn’t be sure, 
of course. 

After breakfast, I went out into 
the yard to look for it, with the 
idea of locking it in the garage 
for the day, but it wasn’t in the 
window box, or anywhere that I 
could see. And since it was Satur- 
day, when a lot of farmers came 
to town, with some of them sure 
to be dropping in to see me, I 
didn’t want to be late to work. 

I was fairly busy during the 
day and didn’t have much time 
for thinking or worrying. But 
when I was wrapping up the sam- 



66 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



pie of soil from the banker’s gar- 
den to send to the Soils Bureau, 
I wondered if maybe there wasn’t 
someone at the university I 
should notify. I also wondered 
about letting someone in Wash- 
ington know, except I didn’t have 
the least idea whom to contact, 
or even which department. 

Coming home that evening, I 
found the plant anchored in 
the garden, in a little space where 
the radishes and lettuce had been. 
The few lettuce plants still left 
in the ground were looking sort 
of limp, but everything else was 
all right. I took a good look at 
the plant. It waved a couple of 
its branches at me — and it wasn’t 
the wind blowing them, for there 
wasn’t any wind — and it nodded 
its coffee-cup pod as if to let me 
know it recognized me. But that 
was all it did. 

A fter supper, I scouted the 
hedge in front of the house 
and found two more of the plants. 
Both of them were dead. 

My next-door neighbors had 
gone to a movie, so I scouted 
their place, too, and found four 
more of the plants, under bushes 
and in corners where they had 
crawled away to die. 

I wondered whether it might 
not have been the plant I’d res- 
cued that the dogs had been bark- 
ing at the night before. I felt 
fairly sure it was. A dog might 



be able to recognize an alien be- 
ing where a man would be unable 
to. 

I counted up. At least seven of 
the things had picked out Banker 
Stevens’ flowerbed for a meal and 
the chemical fertilizer he used 
had killed all but one of them. 
The sole survivor, then, was out 
in the garden, killing off my let- 
tuce. 

I wondered why the lettuce and 
geraniums and Stevens’ flowers 
had reacted as they did. It might 
be that the alien plants produced 
some sort of poison, which they 
injected into the soil to discourage 
other plant life from crowding 
their feeding grounds. That was 
not exactly far-fetched. There are 
trees and plants on Earth that 
accomplish the same thing by 
various methods. Or it might be 
that the aliens sucked the soil 
so dry of moisture and plant- 
food that the other plants simply 
starved to death. 

I did some wondering on why 
they’d come to Earth at all and 
why some of them had stayed. 
If they had traveled from some 
other planet, they must have 
come in a ship, so that hole out 
in Pete’s north forty might have 
been where they stopped to re- 
plenish their food supply, dump- 
ing the equivalent of garbage 
beside the hole. 

And what about the seven I 
had counted? 



GREEN THUMB 



67 



^OULD they have jumped 
ship? Or gone on shore leave 
and run into trouble, the way 
human sailors often do? 

Maybe the ship had searched 
for the missing members of the 
party, had been unable to find 
them, and had gone on. If that 
were so. then my own plant was 
a marooned alien. Or maybe the 
ship was still hunting. 

I wore myself out, thinking 
about it, and went to bed early, 
but lay there tossing for a long 
time. Then, just as I was falling 
asleep, I heard the dog at the gar- 
bage can. You’d think after what 
had happened to him the night 
before, that he’d have decided to 
skip that particular can, but not 
him. He was rattling and banging 
it around, trying to tip it over. 

I picked a skillet off the stove 
and opened the back door. I got a 
good shot at him, but missed him 
by a good ten feet. I was so sore 
that I didn’t even go out to pick 
up the skillet, but went back to 
bed. 

It must have been several hours 
later that I was brought straight 
up in bed by the terror-stricken 
yelping of a dog. I jumped out 
and ran to the window. It was a 
bright moonlit night and the dog 
was going down the driveway as 
if the devil himself were after 
him. Behind him sailed the plant. 
It had wrapped one of its 
branches around his tail and the 



other three branches were really 
giving him a working over. 

They went up the street out of 
sight and, for a long time after 
they disappeared, I could hear 
the dog still yelping. Within a few 
minutes, I saw the plant coming 
up the gravel, walking like a spi- 
der on its eight roots. 

It turned off the driveway and 
planted itself beside a lilac bush 
and seemed to settle down for the 
night. I decided that if it wasn’t 
good for anything else, the gar- 
bage can would be safe, at least. 
If the dog came back again, the 
plant would be waiting to put 
the bee on him. 

I lay awake for a long time, 
wondering how the plant had 
known I didn’t want the dog raid- 
ing the garbage. It probably had 
seen — if that is the proper word — 
me chase him out of the yard. 

I went to sleep with the com- 
fortable feeling that the plant and 
I had finally begun to under- 
stand each other.. 

next day was Sunday and 
I started working on the 
greenhouse, putting it into shape 
so I could cage up the plant. It 
had found itself a sunny spot in 
the garden and was imitating a 
large and particularly ugly weed 
I’d been too lazy to pull out. 

My next-door neighbor came 
over to offer free advice, but he 
kept shifting uneasily and I knew 



68 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



there was something on his mind. 

Finally he came out with it. 
‘‘Funny thing — Jenny swears she 
saw a big plant walking around 
in your yard the other day. The 
kid saw it, too, and he claims it 
chased him.” He tittered a little, 
embarrassed. "You know how 
kids are." 

"Sure,” I said. 

He stood around a while longer 
and gave me some more advice, 
then went across the yard and 
home. 

I worried about what he had 
told me. If the plant really had 
taken to chasing kids, there’d be 
hell to pay. 

I worked at the greenhouse all 
day long, but there was a lot to 
do, for it had been out of use ten 
years or more, and by nightfall 
I was tuckered out. 

After supper, I went out on the 
back stoop and sat on the steps, 
watching the stars. It was quiet 
and restful. 

I hadn’t been there more than 
fifteen minutes when I heard a 
rustling. I looked around and 
there was the plant, coming up 
out of the garden, walking along 
on its roots. 

It sort of squatted down beside 
me and the two of us just sat 
there, looking at the stars. Or, at 
least, I looked at them. I don’t 
actually know if the plant could 
see. If it couldn’t, it had some 
other faculty that was just as 



good as sight. We just sat there. 

After a while, the plant moved 
one of its branches over and took 
hold of my arm with that hand- 
like leaf. I tensed a bit, but its 
touch was gentle enough and I 
sat still, figuring that if the two 
of us were to get along, we 
couldn’t start out by flinching 
away from one another. 

Then, so gradually that at first 
I didn’t notice it, I began to per- 
ceive a sense of gratitude, as if 
the plant might be thanking me. 
I looked around to see what it 
was doing and it wasn’t doing a 
thing, just sitting there as I was, 
but with its "hand” still on my 
arm. 

Yet in some way, the plant was 
trying to make me understand 
that it was grateful to me for 
saving it. 

TT formed no words, you un- 
derstand. Other than rustling 
its leaves, it couldn’t make a 
sound. But I understood that 
some system of communication 
was in operation. No words, but 
emotion— deep, clear, utterly sin- 
cere emotion. 

It eventually got a little embar- 
rassing, this non-stop gratitude. 

"Oh, that’s all right,” I said, 
trying to put an end to it. "You 
would have done as much for 
me.” 

Somehow, the plant must have 
sensed that its thanks had been 



GREEN THUMB 



69 



accepted, because the gratitude 
wore off a bit and something 
else took over — a sense of peace 
and quiet. 

The plant got up and started 
to walk off and I called out to 
it, “Hey, Plant, wait a minute!” 

It seemed to understand that 
I had called it back, for it turned 
around. I took it by a branch 
and started to lead it around the 
boundaries of the yard. If this 
communication business was go- 
ing to be any good, you see, it 
had to go beyond the sense of 
gratitude and peace and quiet. 
So I led the plant all the way 
around the yard and I kept 
thinking at it as hard as I could, 
telling it not to go beyond that 
perimeter. 

By the time I’d finished, I was 
wringing wet with effort. But, 
finally, the plant seemed to be 
trying to say okay. Then I built 
up a mental image of it chasing 
a kid and I shook a mental fin- 
ger at it. The plant agreed. I tried 
to tell it not to move around the 
yard in daylight, when people 
would be able to see it. Whether 
the concept was harder or I was 
getting tired, I don’t know, but 
both the plant and I were limp 
when it at last indicated that it 
understood. 

Lying in bed that night, I 
thought a lot about this problem 
of communication. It was not 
telepathy, apparently, but some- 



thing based on mental pictures 
and emotions. 

But I saw it as my one chance. 
If I could learn to converse, no 
matter how, and the plant could 
learn to communicate something 
beyond abstracts to me, it could 
talk to people, would be accept- 
able and believable, and the au- 
thorities might be willing to 
recognize it as an intelligent be- 
ing. I decided that the best thing 
to do would be to acquaint it with 
the way we humans lived and 
try to make it understand why 
we lived that way. And since I 
couldn’t take my visitor outside 
the yard. I’d have to do it inside. 

I went to sleep, chuckling at 
the idea of my house and yard 
being a classroom for an alien. 

riiHE next day, I received a 
phone call from the Soils 
Bureau at the university. 

“What kind of stuff is this 
you’re sending us?” the man de- 
manded. 

“Just some soil I picked up,” I 
said. “What’s wrong with it?” 

“Sample One is all right. It’s 
just common, everyday Burton 
County soil. But Sample Two, 
that sand — good God, man, it has 
gold dust and flakes of silver and 
some copper in it! All of it in 
minute particles, of course. But if 
some farmer out your way has a 
pit of that stuff, he’s rich.” 

“At the most, he has twenty- 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



five or thirty truckloads of it.” 

‘‘Where’d he get it? Where’d it 
come from?” 

I took a deep breath and told 
him all I knew about the incident 
out at Pete’s north forty. 

He said he’d be right out, but I 
caught him before he hung up 
and asked him about the third 
sample. 

“What was he growing on that 
ground?” the man asked baffled- 
ly. “Nothing I know of could suck 
it that clean, right down to the 
bare bone! Tell him to put in a 
lot of organic material and some 
lime and almost everything else 
that’s needed in good soil, before 
he tries to use it.” 

The Soils people came out to 
Pete’s place and they brought 
along some other men from the 
university. A little later in the 
week, after the papers had spell- 
ed out big headlines, a couple of 
men from Washington showed up. 
But no one seemed able to figure 
it out and they finally gave up. 
The newspapers gave it a play 
and dropped it as soon as the ex- 
perts did. 

During that time, curiosity 
seekers flocked to the farm to 
gape at the hole and the pile of 
sand. They had carried off more 
than half the sand and Pete was 
madder than hell about the whole 
business. 

“I’m going to fill in that hole 
and forget all about it,” he told 



me, and that was what he did. 

Meanwhile, at home, the situa- 
tion was progressing. Plant seem- 
ed to understand what I had told 
him about not moving out of the 
yard and acting like a weed dur- 
ing the daytime and leaving kids 
alone. Everything was peaceable 
and I got no more complaints. 
Best of all, the garbage-stealing 
dog never showed his snout again. 

Several times, during all the 
excitement out at Pete’s place, I 
had been tempted to tell some- 
one from the university about 
Plant. In each case, I decided not 
to, for we weren’t getting along 
too well in the talk department. 

But in other ways, we were do- 
ing just fine. 

¥ LET Plant watch me while I 
* took an electric motor apart 
and then put it together again, 
but I wasn’t too sure he knew 
what it was all about. I tried to 
show him the concept of mechani- 
cal power and I demonstrated 
how the motor would deliver that 
power and I tried to tell him what 
electricity was. But I got all bog- 
ged down with that, not knowing 
too much about it myself. I don’t 
honestly think Plant got a thing 
out of that electric motor. 

With the motor of the car, 
though, we were more success- 
ful. We spent one whole Sunday 
dismantling it and then putting it 
back together. Watching what I 



GREEN THUMB 



71 



was doing, Plant seemed to take 
a lot of interest in it. 

We had to keep the garage door 
locked and it was a scorcher of a 
day and, anyhow, I'd much 
rather spend a Sunday fishing 
than tearing down a motor. I 
wondered a dozen times if it was 
worth it, if there might not be 
easier ways to teach Plant the 
facts of our Earth culture. 

I was all tired out and failed to 
hear the alarm and woke up an 
hour later than I should. I jump- 
ed into my clothes, ran out to the 
garage, unlocked the door and 
there was Plant. He had parts 
from that motor strewn all over 
the floor and he was working 
away at it, happy as a clam. I 
almost took an axe to him, but 
I got hold of myself in time. I 
locked the door behind me and 
walked to work. 

All day, I wondered how Plant 
had gotten into the garage. Had 
he sneaked back in the night be- 
fore, when 1 wasn’t looking, or 
had he been able to pick the lock? 
I wondered, too, what sort of 
shape rd find the car in when 
I got home. I could just see my- 
self working half the night, put- 
ting it back together. 

I left work a little early. If I 
had to work on the car, I want- 
ed an early start. 

When I got home, the motor 
was all assembled and Plant was 
out in the garden, acting like a 



weed. Seeing him there, I real- 
ized he knew how to unlock the 
door, for I’d locked it when I left 
that morning. 

I turned on the ignition, mak- 
ing bets with myself that it 
wouldn’t start. But it did. I rode 
around town a little to check it 
and there wasn’t a thing wrong 
with it. 

F or the next lesson, I tried 
something simpler. I got my 
carpentry tools and showed them 
to Plant and let him watch me 
while I made a bird house. Not 
that I needed any more bird 
houses. The place already crawl- 
ed with them. But it was the 
easiest, quickest thing I could 
think of to show Plant how we 
worked in wood. 

He watched closely and seem- 
ed to understand what was going 
on, all right, but I detected a sad- 
ness in him. I put my hand on 
his arm to ask him what was the 
matter. 

All that I got was a mournful 
reaction. 

It bewildered me. Why should 
Plant take so much interest in 
monkeying around with a motor 
and then grieve at the making of 
a bird house? I didn’t get it fig- 
ured out until a few days later, 
when Plant saw me picking a 
bouquet of flowers for the kitchen 
table. 

And then it hit me.

VOLANT was a plant and flow* 
^ ers were plants and so was 
lumber, or at least lumber at one 
time had been a plant. And I 
stood there, with the bouquet 
dangling in my hand and Plant 
looking at me, and I thought of 
all the shocks he had in store for 
him when he found out more 
about us — how we slaughtered 
our forests, grew plants for food 
and clothing, squee2ed or boiled 
drugs from them. 

It was just like a human going 
to another planet, I realized, and 
finding that some alien life form 
grew humans for food. 

Plant didn’t seem to be sore 
at me nor did he shrink from me 
in horror. He was just sad. When 
he got sad. he was the saddest- 
looking thing you could possibly 
imagine. A bloodhound with a 
hangover would have looked posi* 
tively joyous in comparison. 

If we ever had gotten to the 
point where we could have really 
talked — about things like ethics 
and philosophy, I mean — I might 
have learned just how Plant felt 
about our plant-utilizing culture. 
I’m sure he tried to tell me. but I 
couldn’t understand much of 
what he was driving at. 

We were sitting out on the steps 
one night, looking at the stars. 
Earlier, Plant had been showing 
me his home planet, or it may 
have been some of the planets he 
had visited. I don’t know. All I 



could get were fuzzy mental 
pictures and reactions. One place 
was hot and red, another blue and 
cold. There was another that had 
all the colors of the rainbow and 
a cool, restful feel about it, as if 
there might have been gentle 
winds and fountains and bird- 
songs in the twilight. 

We had been sitting there for 
quite a while when he put his 
hand back on my arm again and 
he showed me a plant. He must 
have put considerable effort into 
getting me to visualize it, for the 
image was sharp and clear. It was 
a scraggy, rundown plant and it 
looked even sadder than Plant 
looked when he got sad, if that 
is possible. When I started feel- 
ing sorry for it, he began to think 
of kindness and, when he thought 
of things like kindness and sad- 
ness and gratitude and happiness, 
he could really pour it on. 

He had me thinking such big, 
kindly thoughts, I was afraid that 
I would burst. While I sat there, 
thinking that way. I saw the 
plant begin to perk up. It grew 
and flowered and was the most 
beautiful thing I had ever seen. 
It matured its seeds and dropped 
them. Swiftly, little plants sprang 
from the seeds and they were 
healthy and full of ginger, too. 

I mulled that one over several 
days, suspecting I was crazy for 
even thinking what I did. I tried 
to shrug it off. but it wouldn’t

shrug. It gave me an idea. 

The only way I could get rid of 
it was to try it out. 

in back of the toolshed 
was the sorriest yellow rose in 
town. Why it dung 'to life, year 
after year, I could never figure 
out. It had been there ever since 
I was a boy. The only reason it 
hadn’t been dug up and thrown 
away long ago was that no one 
had ever needed the ground it was 
rooted in. 

I thought, if a plant ever need- 
ed help, that yellow rose was it. 

So I sneaked out back of the 
toolshed, making sure that Plant 
didn’t see me, and stood in front 
of that yellow rose. I began to 
think kindly thoughts about it, 
although God knows it was hard 
to think kindly toward such a 
wretched thing. I felt foolish and 
hoped none of the neighbors spot- 
ted me, but I kept at it. I didn’t 
seem to accomplish much to start 
with, but I went back, time after 
time. In a week or so, I got so 
that I just naturally loved that 
yellow rose to pieces. 

After four or five days, I began 
to see some change in it. At the 
end of two weeks, it had develop- 
ed from a scraggy, no-account 
bush to one that any rose fancier 
would have been proud to own. It 
dropped its bug-chewed leaves 
and grew new ones that were so 
shiny, they looked as if they were 



waxed. Then it grew big flower 
buds and, in no time at all, was 
a blaze of yellow glory. 

But I didn’t quite believe it. In 
the back of my mind, I figured 
that Plant must have seen me 
doing it and helped along a bit. 
So I decided to test the process 
again where he couldn’t interfere. 

Millie had been trying for a 
couple of years to grow an Afri- 
can violet in a flower pot at the 
office. By this time, even she was 
willing to admit it was a losing 
battle. I had made a lot of'jokes 
about the violet and, at times, 
Millie had been sore at me about 
it. Like the yellow rose, it was 
a hard-luck plant. The bugs ate 
it. Millie forgot to water it. It 
got knocked onto the floor. Visi- 
tors used it for an ashtray. 

Naturally, I couldn’t give it 
the close, intensive treatment I’d 
given the rose, but I made a point 
to stop for a few minutes every 
day beside the violet and think 
good things about it and, in a 
couple of weeks, it perked up con- 
siderably. By the end of the 
month, it had bloomed for the 
first time in its life. 

Meanwhile, Plant’s education 
continued. 

At first, he’d balked at enter- 
ing the house, but finally trusted 
me enough to go in. He didn’t 
spend much time there, for the 
house was too full of reminders 
that ours was a plant-utilizing 



74 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



culture. Furniture, clothing, ce- 
real, paper — even the house it- 
self — all were made of vegetation. 
I got an old butter tub and filled 
it with soil and put it in one 
corner of the dining room, so he 
could eat in the house if he want- 
ed to, but I don’t remember that 
he even once took a snack out of 
that tub. 

A LTHOUGH I didn’t admit it 
then, I knew that what Plant 
and I had tried to do had been a 
failure. Whether someone else 
might have done better, I don’t 
know. I suspect he might have. 
But I didn’t know how to go 
about getting in touch and 1 was 
afraid of being laughed at. It’s a 
terrible thing, our human fear of 
ridicule. 

And there was Plant to con- 
sider, too. How would he take 
being passed on to someone else? 
I’d screw up my courage to do 
something about it, and then 
Plant would come up out of the 
garden and sit beside me on the 
steps, and we’d talk — not about 
anything that mattered, really, 
but about happiness and sadness 
and brotherhood, and my courage 
would go glimmering and I’d 
have to start all over again. 

I’ve since thought how much 
like two lost children we must 
have been, strange kids raised in 
different countries, who would 
have liked to play together, ex-

cept neither knew the rules for 
the other’s games or spoke the 
other’s" language. 

I know ... I know. According 
to common sense, you begin with 
mathematics. You show the alien 
that you know two *and two are 
four. Then you draw the Solar 
System and show him the Sun on 
the diagram and then point to the 
Sun overhead and you point to 
Earth on the diagram, then point 
to yourself. In this way, you 
demonstrate to him that you 
know about the Solar System and 
about space and the stars and so 
on. 

Then you hand him the paper 
and the pencil. 

But what if he doesn’t know 
mathematics? What if the two 
plus - two - makes - four routine 
doesn’t mean a thing to him? 
What if he’s never seen a draw- 
ing? What if he can’t draw— or 
see or hear or feel or think the 
way you do? 

To deal with an alien, you’ve 
got to get down to basics. 

And maybe math isn’t basic. 

Maybe diagrams aren’t. 

In that case, you have to search 
for something that is. 

Yet there must be certain uni- 
versal basics. 

I think I know what they are. 

That, if nothing else. Plant 
taught me. 

Happiness is basic. And sadness 
is basic. And gratitude, in perhaps 



a lesser sense. Kindness, too. And 
perhaps hatred — although Plant 
and I never dealt in that. 

Maybe brotherhood. For the 
sake of humanity, I hope so. 

But kindness and happiness 
and brotherhood are awkward 
tools to use in reaching specific 
understanding, although in 
Plant’s world, they may not be. 

TT was getting on toward au- 
tumn and I was beginning to 
wonder how I’d take care of Plant 
during the winter months. 

I could have kept him in the 
house, but he hated it there. 

Then, one night, we were sit- 
ting on the back steps, listening 
to the first crickets of the season. 

The ship came down without 
a sound. I didn’t see it until it 
was about at treetop level. It 
floated down and landed between 
the house and toolshed. 

I was startled for a moment, 
but not frightened, and perhaps 
not too surprised. In the back of 
my head. I’d wondered all the 
time, without actually knowing it, 
whether Plant’s pals might not 
ultimately find him. 

The ship was a shimmery sort 
of thing, as if it might not have 
been made of metal and was not 
really solid. I noticed that it had 
not really landed, but floated a 
foot or so above the grass. 

Three other Plants stepped out 
and the oddest part of it was that 



76 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



there wasn’t any door. They just 
came out of the ship and the ship 
closed behind them. 

Plant took me by the arm and 
twitched it just a little, to make 
me understand he wanted me to 
walk with him to the ship. He 
made little comforting thoughts 
to try to calm me down. 

And all the time that this was 
going on, I could sense the talk 
between Plant and those other 
three — but just grasping the 
fringe of the conversation, barely 
knowing there was talk, not 
aware of what was being said. 

And then, while Plant stood be- 
side me, with his hand still on 
my arm, those other plants walk- 
ed up. One by one, each took me 
by the other arm and stood facing 
me for a moment and told me 
thanks and happiness. 

Plant told me the same, for the 
last time, and then the four of 
them walked toward the ship and 
disappeared into it. The ship left 
me standing there, watching it 
rise into the night, until I could- 
n’t see it any longer. 

I stood there for a long time, 
staring up into the sky, with the 
thanks and happiness fading and 
loneliness beginning to creep in. 

I knew that, somewhere up 
there, was a larger ship, that in it 
were many other Plants, that one 
of them had lived with me for 
almost six months and that others 
of them had died in the hedges

and fence corners of the neigh- 
borhood. I knew also that it had 
been the big ship that had scoop- 
ed out the load of nutritious soil 
from Pete Skinner’s field. 

F inally. I stopped looking at 
the sky. Over behind the tool- 
shed, I saw the whiteness of the 
yellow rose in bloom and once 
again I thought about the basics. 

I wondered if happiness and 
kindness, perhaps even emotions 
that we humans do not know, 
might not be used on Plant’s 
world as we use the sciences. 

For the rose bush had bloomed 
when I thought kindly thoughts 
of it. And the African violet had 
found a new life in the kindness 
of a human. 

Startling as it may seem, fool- 
ish as it may sound, it is not an 
unknown phenomenon. There are 
people who have the knack of 
getting the most out of a flower- 
bed or a garden. And it is said of 
these people that they have green 
thumbs. 

May it not be that green 
ttiiJmbness is not so much con- 
cerned with skill or how much 
care is taken of a plant, as with 
the kindliness and the interest of 
the person tending it? 

For eons, the plant life of this 
planet has been taken for grant- 
ed- It is simply there. By and 
large, plants are given little affec- 
tion. They are planted or sown. 



They grow. In proper season, they 
are harvested. 

I sometimes wonder if, as hun- 
ger tightens its grip upon our 
teeming planet, there may not be 
a vital need for the secret of 
green thumbness. 

If kindness and sympathy can 
cause a plant to produce beyond 
its normal wont, then shouldn’t 
we consider kindness as a tool 
to ward off Earth’s hunger? How 
much more might be produced if 
the farmer loved his wheat? 

It’s silly, of course, a principle 
that could not gain acceptance. 

And undoubtedly it would not 
work — not in a plant -utilizing 
culture. 

For how could you keep on 
convincing a plant that you feel 
kindly toward it when, season af- 
ter season, you prove that your 
only interest in it is to eat it or 
make it into clothing or chop it 
down for lumber? 

1 walked out back of the shed 
and stood beside the yellow rose, 
trying to find the answer. The 
yellow rose stirred, like a pretty 
woman who knows she’s being 
admired, but no emotion came 
from it. 

The thanks and happiness were 
gone. There was nothing left but 
the loneliness. 

Damned vegetable aliens — up- 
setting a man so he couldn’t eat 
his breakfast cereal in peace!

when you are a teacher, you 



expect kids to play pranks. 
But with tigers— and worse? 



S TANDING braced — or, as 
it seemed to him, crucified 
— against the length of the 
blackboard, John Ward tried to 
calculate his chances of heading 
off the impending riot. It didn’t 
seem likely that an3rthing he 
could do would stop it. 

“Say something,” he told him- 
self. “Continue the lecture, talkl” 
But against the background of 



hysterical voices from the school 
yard, against the brass fear in his 
mouth, he was dumb. He looked 
at the bank of boys’ faces in front 
of him. They seemed to him now 
as identical as metal stampings, 
each on? completely deadpan, 
each pair of jaws moving in a 
single rhythm, like a mechanical 
herd. He could feel the tension 
in them, and he knew that, in a

moment, they would begin to 
move. He felt shame and humilia- 
tion that he had failed. 

“Shakespeare,” he said clearly, 
holding his voice steady, “for 
those of you who have never 
heard of him, was the greatest of 
all dramatists. Greater even,” he 
went on doggedly, knowing that 
they might take it as a proyoca- 
tion, “than the writers for the 
Spellcasts.” He stopped talking 
abruptly. 



^^HREE tigers stepped out of 
the ceiling. Their eyes were 
glassy, absolutely rigid, as if, 
like the last of the hairy mam- 
moths, they had been frozen a 
long age in some glacial crevasse. 
They hung there a moment and 
then fell into the room like a 
furry waterfall. They landed 
snarling. 

Something smashed viciously 
into the wall beside Ward’s head. 
From the back of the room, some- 
one’s hand flashed a glitter of 
light. Ward leaped away and 
cut across the end of the room 
toward the escape chute. Hold- 
ing his ring with its identifying 
light beam before him, he leap- 
ed into the slot like a racing 
driver. Behind him, the room 
t exploded in shouts and snarls. 
The gate on the chute slammed 
shut after him, and he heard 
them scratching and banging at 
it. Without the identifying light, 



they would be unable to get 
through. He took a long breath of 
relief as he shot down the pol- 
ished groove of the slide into the 
Mob Quad. The boys he’d left 
behind knew how to protect 
themselves. 

They were all there — Dr. Allen- 
by, McCarthy the psych man, 
Laura Ames the pretty gym 
teacher, Foster, Jensen — all of 

them. So it had been general 

then, not just his group which 
had rioted. He knew it was all 
the more serious now, because it 
had not been limited to one out- 
break. 

“You, too. Ward?” Dr. Al- 
lenby said sadly. He was a short, 
slender man with white hair and 
a white mustache. He helped 
Ward up from where he had fall- 
en at the foot of the escape slide. 
“What was it in your classroom 
this time?” 

“Tigers,” Ward said. Standing 
beside Allenby, he felt very tall, 
although he was only of average 
height. He smoothed down his 
wiry dark hair and began ener- 
getically brushing the dust from 
his clothing. 

“Well, it’s always something,” 
Allenby said tiredly. 

He seemed more sad than up- 
set, Ward thought, a spent old 
man clinging to the straw of a 
dream. He saw where the meta- 
phor was leading and pushed it 
aside. If Allenby were a drown -

ing man, then Ward himself was 
one. He looked at the others. 

^^HEY were all edgy or simply 

frightened, but they were tak- 
ing it very well. Some of them 
were stationed at the gates of the 
Quad, but none of them, as far 
as he could see, was armed. Ex- 
cept for McCarthy. The psych 
man was wearing his Star 
Watcher helmet and had a B- 
gun strapped at his side. Prob- 
ably had a small force-field in 
his pocket, Ward thought, and 
a pair of brass knuckles. 

“Soothe philosophy king got 
it too,” McCarthy said, coming 
over to them. He was a big man, 
young but already florid with 
what Ward had always thought 
of as a roan complexion. “Love, 
understanding, sympathy — ^was- 
n’t that what was supposed to 
work wonders? All they need is 
a copy of Robinson Crusoe and a 
chance to follow their natural in- 
stincts, eh?” 

“One failure doesn't prove any- 
thing,” Ward said, trying not to 
be angry. 

“One failure? How often do 
they have to make us hit the 
slides for the safety of the Mob 
Quad before you adopt a sensible 
theory?” 

“Let’s not go through all that 
again. Restraint, Rubber hoses 
and Radiological shock — I’ve 
heard all about the 3 Rs.” 



“At least they work!” 

“Oh, yes, they work fine. Ex- 
cept that they never learn to read 
and they can’t sign their names 
with anything but an X.” 

“It was progressive education 
that destroyed reading,” Mc- 
Carthy said heatedly. “And they 
don’t need to sign their names— 
that’s what universal fingerprint- 
ing is for.” 

“Please, gentlemen,” Dr. Al- 
lenby interrupted gently. “This 
kind of squabbling is unbecoming 
to members of the faculty. Be- 
sides,” he smiled with faded 
irony, “considering the circum- 
stances, it’s hardly a proper time.” 
He pointed to the windows over 
the Quad where an occasional 
figure could be seen behind the 
glass. Lucky it was unbreakable, 
Ward thought, hearing the wild 
hysterical yelling from inside. 

“Mob Quad,” Allenby said bit- 
terly. “1 thought I was naming it 
as a joke. The original Mob Quad 
was at Merton College, Oxford. 
One of the old defunct univer- 
sities. They had a Mob Quad to 
shelter students and professors 
from the town mobs. Professors 
and students, gentlemen — they 
were a united front in those days. 
I suppose no one could have pre- 
dicted our present circum- 
stances.” 

“That’s all history,” McCarthy 
said impatiently. “Bunk. This is 
now, and I say the thing to do—” 



WHAT ROUGH BEAST?

“We know.” Allenby waved 
him to silence. “But your way has 
been tried long enough. How 
long is it since Los Angeles Day, 
when the U.N. buildings were 
bombed and burned by the orig- 
inal 3R Party in order to get rid 
of Unesco? Two hundred forty- 
three years next June, isn’t it? 
And your Party had had all that 
time to get education back on 
what it calls a sane program. Now 
nobody is educated.” 

“It takes time to undo the dam- 
age of progressive education,” 
McCarthy said. “Besides, a lot of 
that junk — reading, writing — 
as I’ve often told Ward — ” 

“All right,” Ward broke in. 
“But two and a half centuries is 




long enough. Someone must try 
a new tack or the country is 
doomed. There isn’t much time. 
The Outspace invaders — ” 

“The Outspace invaders are 
simply Russians,” McCarthy said 
flatly. 

“That’s a convenient view if 
you’re an ostrich. Or, if you want 
to keep the Pretend War going, 
until the Outspacers take us 
over.” 

1^'cCARTHY snorted contemp- 
tuously. “Ward, you damn- 
ed fool — ” 

“That will be all, gentlemen,” 
Allenby said. He did not raise his 
voice, but McCarthy was silent 
and Ward marveled, as he had on 
other occasions, at the authority 
the old man carried. 

“Well,” McCarthy said after a 
moment, “what are you going to 
do about this?" He gestured to- 
ward the windows from which 
shouts still rang. 

“Nothing. Let it run its course.” 

“But you can’t do that, man!” 

“I can and I will. What do you 
think, John?” 

“I agree,” Ward said. “They 
won’t hurt each other — they 
never have yet. It’ll wear itself 
out and then, tomorrow, we’ll try 
again.” He did not feel optimistic 
about how things would be the 
next day, but he didn’t want to 
voice his fears. “The thing that 
worries me,” he said, “are those

tigers. Where’d they come from?” 
‘‘What tigers?” McCarthy 
wanted to know. 

Ward told him. 

‘‘First it was cats,” McCarthy 
said, ‘‘then birds . now tigers. 
Either you’re seeing’ things or 
someone’s using a concealed pro* 
jector.” 

‘‘I thought of the projector, 
but these seemed real. Stunned 
at first — as if they were as sur- 
prised as I was.” 

‘‘You have a teleport in your 
class,” Allenby said. 

‘‘Yes — maybe that’s the way it 
was done. I don’t know quite 
what to make of it,” Ward said. 
If he voiced his real suspicion 
now. he knew it would sound 
silly. ‘‘I know some of them can 
teleport. I’ve seen them. Small 
things, of course . .” 

‘‘Not in my classes,” McCarthy 
said indignantly. *‘I absolutely 
forbid that sort of thing.” 

‘‘You do wrong, then,” Allen- 
by said. 

‘‘It’s unscientific!” 

‘‘Perhaps. But we want to en- 
courage whatever wild talents 
they possess.” 

‘‘So that they can materialize 
tigers in — in our bedrooms, I sup- 
pose. Well, I’ve had enough. Stay 
here and stew if you like, but 
I'm going back to my class. I 
turned the hypno-gas on them be- 
fore I took my dive. They should 
be nice and gentle for me by this 



time.” He turned away defiantly. 

‘‘I know how you feel,” Allen- 
by said when McCarthy was 
gone. ‘‘He’s a holy terror, John. 
Shouldn’t be around here. But I 
have to keep him, since he was 
recommended by the 3Rs and the 
Educational League. He gives the 
school a bit of protective colora- 
tion. Perhaps he’s why they 
haven’t closed us down yet.” 

‘‘I know — I’m not blaming you. 
Do you suppose we can go back 
to our jobs? It sounds as if it’s 
wearing itself out.” He gestured 
up at the windows. 

‘‘Can’t do anything more to- 
day.” 

‘‘No, you’re probably right.” 

¥^OR a moment Allenby was 
silent as they went toward the 
gate of the Quad. Then he said, 
‘‘John, you’re a good man. I don’t 
want you to despair. What we’re 
attempting — to bring education 
back into our culture — is a good 
and noble cause. And you can’t 
really blame the kids.” He nod- 
ded up at the walls. ‘‘They’ve just 
had too many Spellcasts, too 
many scares in the Pretend War 
— they can’t believe in any future 
and they don’t know anything 
about their past. Don’t blame 
them.” 

‘‘No, sir — I don’t.” 

‘‘Just do our best,” Allenby 
said. ‘‘Try to teach them the for- 
gotten things. Then, in their turn,

in the next generation . 

“Yes, we have to believe that. 
But. Dr. Allenby, we could go a 
lot faster if we were to screen 
them. If they were all like young 
Tomkins, we’d be doing very 
well. But as long as we have peo- 
ple like young Cress or Hodge or 
Rottke — well, it’s hard to do any- 
thing with them. They go straight 
from school into their fathers’ 
firms — after all, if you’re guar- 
anteed a business success in life, 
you don’t struggle to learn. And. 
anyway, you don’t need much 
education to be a dope salesman 
or a numbers consultant.” 

“I’d like to have the place run 
only for the deserving and the 
interested,” Allenby said. “But 
we haven’t much choice. We must 
have some of these boys who are 
from the best families. More pro- 
tective coloration — like Mc- 
Carthy. If we were only to run 
the place for the brilliant ones, 
you know we’d be closed down in 
a week.” 

“I suppose so,” Ward agreed. 
He wondered whether he should 
tell his suspicions to Allenby. Bet- 
ter not, he decided. Allenby had 
enough to think about. 

The last of the shouting had 
died. As Ward went out the gate 
of the Quad, he felt his heart lift 
a little the way it always did 
when he started for home. Out 
here, miles from the city, the air 
was clean and the Sun was bright 



on the hills, quilted now with the 
colors of autumn. There was a 
tang of wood smoke in the air 
and, in the leaves beside the path, 
he saw an apple. It was very cold 
and damp and there was a wild 
taste to it as he bit into the fruit. 
He was a tired teacher, glad to be 
going home after a hard day in 
the school. He hoped that no one 
had been hurt by the tigers. 

J OHN WARD pushed the 
papers across his desk, reach- 
ed for his pipe and sighed. “Well, 
that does it. Bobby.” he said. 

He looked at the red-headed 
six-year-old boy sitting in the 
too-big chair across from him. 
Bobby was a small boy with a 
freckled face and skinned knees. 
He sat in the big chair with his 
feet sticking straight out in front 
of him and played with a slide 
rule. 

“I’ve taught you all the math 
I know,” Ward said. “Differen- 
tial. integral, topology, Maddow’s 
Theory of Transfinite Domains 
— that’s as far as I go. What’s 
next?” 

“I don’t know, John. I was 
thinking of going in for nuclear 
physics, but . 

“Go on, but what?” Ward 
prompted. 

“Well . .” Bobby gave him 
an embarrassed look. “I’m kind 
of tired of that stuff. It’s easy 
and not very interesting. What 



WHAT ROUGH BEAST?

I’d really like — ” He broke off 
and began fiddling with the slide 
rule again. 

“Yes, Bobby, what would you 
like?” 

“You won’t be mad?” 

“No.” Ward smiled. 

“Well, I’d really like to try to 
write a poem — a real poem, I 
mean, not advertiverse — a real 
poem, with rhymes and every- 
thing.” He paused and looked to 
see how Ward was taking it and 
then went on with a rush. “I know 
it’s almost illegal, but I want to 
try. I really want to.” 

“But why?” 

“Oh, I dunno — I just want 
to. I remember that an old poet 
named Yeats said something 
about writing poems — the fas- 
cination with what’s difficult. 
Maybe that’s it.” 

“Well,” Ward said, “it’s a dan- 
gerous occupation.” He looked 
at the boy with wonder and 
pride. “Sure, Bobby, give it a 
try if you want to.” 

“Gee, thanks!” the boy said. 
He jumped out of the chair and 
started toward the door of the 
study. 

“Bobby,” Ward called. “Tell 
me — can you teleport?” 

“Not exactly,” Bobby said. The 
papers on the desk in front of 
Ward suddenly fluttered into the 
air. They did a lazy circle of the 
room, swung into an echelon and 
performed a slow chandelle, be- 



fore dropping into Bobby’s hand. 
“I can do that stuff. But I didn’t 
do the tigers.” 

“I’m sure you didn’t.” 

“It was a good stunt, but I 
wouldn’t do that to you, John.” 

“I know. Do you know who 
did?” 

“I’m not sure.” Bobby didn’t 
look at him now. “Anyway, it’d 
be snitching.” 

“I’m not asking you to tell.” 

“Gee, I’m sorry,” Bobby said. 
“I wanted to tell you in the 
yard. I knew there was going to 
be a rumble, but I couldn’t 
snitch.” 

“No, of course not.” Ward 
shooed him off. “Go write your 
poem.” 

“"DUT tigers!” Ann said. “Why 
tigers, John?” 

“I suppose they were con- 
venient.” 

“Tigers are never convenient.” 

He crossed the room, picked up 
the phone and dialed. After a 
brief conversation, he turned back 
to her. “Well, now we know 
where they came from,” he said. 
“The zoo. Disappeared for about 
half an hour. Then reappeared 
again.” 

“I don’t care where they came 
from,” his wife said. Her dark 
head was bent over some work in 
her lap. “What difference does it 
make whether they came from 
the zoo or from Burma? The 



86

point is, bringing them in is dan- 
gerous — it’s hooliganism, and 
don’t tell me that boys will be 
boys.” 

“It doesn’t show very mature 
judgment,” he admitted. “But 
Bobby and his pals aren’t very 
old." 

“Only about four hundred and 
eighty-five years old, according 
to his I.Q. Do you think it was 
Bobby?” 

“Bobby isn’t the only genius 
we’ve got. There’s Danny, re- 
member, and William Tender — 
and Bobby said he couldn’t tele- 
port big stuff.” 

“Well?” 

John Ward had to confide his 
theory. He felt that he had to tell 
Ann everything, all the specula- 
tion and suspicion he’d carried 
around with him for so long. 

“I think we’re being invaded,” 
he said. 

Ann looked at him steadily for 
a moment. “You mean the Out- 
spacers?” 

“Yes — but not in the way 
you’re thinking. It’s been report- 
ed that the Saucers are Russian 
or Argentine or Bra2ilian or Chi- 
nese — that’s what we’re told. 
But that’s simply Pretend War 
propaganda and almost no one 
believes it any longer. Most of 
us think of them as Outspacers.” 

“And you think they’re moving 
in?” 

“I think they’re watching — sort 



of — well, sort of monitoring.” 
“Monitoring us? What for?” 
“No, not us. I think they’ve 
planted children among us. I 
think the Outspacers are school- 
teachers." 

Ann got briskly to her feet. 
“I think,” she said, “that we’ll 
take your temperature and see if 
perhaps you shouldn’t be in bed.” 

W AIT, Ann, I’m serious. I 
know it sounds crazy, but 
it isn’t. Think of it this way — 
here’s a race, obviously human- 
oid, on another star system. For 
some reason, overpopulation or 
whatever, they have to find room 
on another planet. Let’s assume 
they’re a highly civilized race — 
they'd have to be to have inter- 
stellar travel — so, of course, they 
can’t simply take over Earth in 
an act of aggression. That would 
be repugnant to them. 

“So they seed our planet with 
their children. These children are 
geniuses. When they grow up, 
they are naturally the leaders of 
the world’s governments and 
they’re in a position to allow the 
Outspacers to live with us on 
Earth. To live peacefully with 
us, whereas now, if the Outspac- 
ers were to try to live here, it 
would mean war.” 

“And you think Bobby is one 
of these — these seedlings?” 
“Maybe. He’s unbelievingly in- 
telligent. And he’s a foundling.” 



WHAT ROUGH BEAST? 



87 



“What has that to do with it?” 
'Tve looked up the statistics 
on foundlings. When the Saucers 
hrst began to appear, back in 
the 20th Century, the number 
of foundlings began to increase. 
Not a lot. but some. Then the 
Saucers disappeared for almost 
two and a half centuries and the 
number decreased. Now, since 
the Outspacers are once more evi- 
dent, the number of foundlings 
has increased very greatly.” 
“And your other geniuses? All 
foundlings?” 

“Not all. But that doesn’t mean 
anything — plenty of foundlings 
are adopted. And who knows 
which child is an adopted one?” 
Ann Ward sat down again. 
“You’re quite serious about this, 
John?” 

“There’s no way of being sure, 
but I am convinced.” 

“It’s frightening.” 

“Is Bobby frightening? In all 
the time I’ve been tutoring him, 
has he ever been out of line?” 
“Bobby’s no alien!” 

“He may be.” 

“Well, anyway, of course Bob- 
by isn’t frightening. But that 
business of the tigers — that is!” 
“They didn’t hurt anyone.” 
“No. but don’t you see. John? 
It’s — irresponsible. How do you 
fit it in with your super-intelli- 
gent super-beings?” 

“Ann,” he said impatiently, 
“we’re dealing with fantastically 



intelligent beings, but beings who 
are still cfii/dren— can’t you un- 
derstand that? They’re just find- 
ing out their powers — one is a 
telepath, another levitates, a third 
is a teleport. A riot is started by 
Alec Cress or Jacky Hodge or one 
of those 3R hoodlums. And our 
child genius can’t resist making a 
kind of joke of his own.” 

“Joke? With timers? John, I 
tell you I’m frightened.” Her hus- 
band said nothing and she look- 
ed at him sharply. “You hope 
it’s this way, don’t you?” 

I^OR a moment he didn’t an- 
swer. Then he sighed. “Yes. 
Yes. I do both believe and hope 
I’m right. Ann. I never thought 
that I’d be willing to give up the 
struggle — that’s what it amounts 
to. But I don’t think the human 
race can manage itself any more. 
So, I’m willing and glad to have 
some other race teach us how to 
live. I know we’ve always looked 
on the idea of domination by 
some race from the stars with 
both terror and revulsion. But 
we’ve made such a mess of things 
on Earth that I, at least, would be 
glad to see them come.” 

After a while. Ann said. “I’ve 
got to do some shopping for 
supper.” 

She began mechanically put- 
ting her work away. 

“You’re shocked?” 

“Yes. And relieved, too. a little. 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



And, at the same time, still a bit 
frightened.” 

“It’s probably for the best.” 
“Yes. It’s sad, though. Have 
you told this to anyone else?” 
“No. After all, it’s still only a 
theory. I’ve got to find some kind 
of proof. Except that I don’t 
know how." 

“You’ve convinced me.” She 
stood in the doorway, then turned 
to him and he could see that she 
was crying. She dashed the tears 
from her eyes. “I suppose we 
have to go on doing the same 
things. We have to have dinner 
tonight. I must shop . 

He took her in his arms. “It’ll 
be all right,” he said. 

“I feel so helpless! What are 
you going to do?*' 

“Right now,” he said, “I think 
I’ll go fishing.” 

Ann began to laugh, a little 
hysterically. “You are relaxed 
about it,” she said. 

“Might as well relax and give 
it more thought.” 

Ann kissed him and went into 
the kitchen. She was gone when 
he came out with his rod and 
creel. Going down the walk under 
the trees, he was aware again of 
what a fine autumn afternoon it 
was. He began to whistle as he 
went down the hill toward the 
stream. 

He didn’t catch anything, of 
course. He had fished the pool at 
least a hundred times without 



luck, but that did not matter. He 
knew there was a fighting old bass 
in its depths and, probably, he 
would have been sorry to catch 
him. Now, his line gently agitated 
the dark water as he sat under a 
big tree on the stream bank and 
smoked. Idly he opened the copy 
of Yeats’ poems and began read- 
ing: Turning and turning in the 
widening gyre . 

In mounting excitement, he 
read the coldly beautiful, the ter- 
rible and revelatory poem 
through to the end. And what 
rough beast, its hour come round 
at last, slouches toward Bethle- 
hem to be born? 

Ward became aware that his 
pipe was out. He put it away, 
feeling the goose pimples, gener- 
ated by the poem, leave his flesh. 
Then he shook himself and sigh- 
ed. We’re lucky, he thought, it 
might have been the way the old 
boy predicted it in the poem. It 
might have been terrible. 

He sighed again, watching his 
line in the dark water, and 
thought of Bobby. You could 
hardly call Bobby a rough beast. 
The line flickered in the water 
and then was still. He would have 
a lot of time for this kind of life, 
he thought, if his theory were cor- 
rect. He watched a flight of leaves 
dapple the pool with the insignia 
of autumn. He was not sure he 
wanted to spend a lifetime fish- 
ing. 



WHAT ROUGH BEAST? 



89 



SUDDENLY the pool exploded 
into motion, the water frothed 
and flashed white and the line in 
his hand sang like a piano wire. 
Automatically, he jerked his line 
and began to reel in, at the same 
time his mind was telling him no 
line of its weight could long hold 
what he had hooked. As suddenly 
as the action had begun, it was 
ended and he was pulling some- 
thing heavy against the stream 
bank. He gaped at it, his eyes 
popping. Then he heard the rustle 
of leaves and the snap of a stick 
behind him. 

“Catch somep’n, teach’?” a 
voice asked. 

“Yes, I caught something.” He 
got his tobacco pouch from his 
pocket and fllled his pipe, trying 
to keep his hands from trembling. 

“Gee, he’s a big one, teach’,” 
the voice said. 

Ward stood up. The boy, Jacky 
Hodge, leaning over the bank 
looking down at the fish. Behind 
him. Ward saw Bobby, Alec 
Cress, Danny and several others. 
Now which of you is laughing? 
he wondered. But there was no 
way to tell. Jacky, a boy of 
twelve or thirteen, had his usual 
look of stupid good nature. Bob- 
by, under the flambeau of red 
hair, dreamed at the fish. The 
others wore the open poker faces 
of children. 

“That’s a funny fish," one of 
them said and then they were 



all laughing as they raced away. 

With some difficulty. Ward got 
the fish out of the water and be- 
gan to drag it up the hill toward 
his house. 

“Outspace fish,” Ward said as 
he dumped the thing on the work 
table where Ann had deposited 
the bag of groceries. 

“Where did you get that?" 

“I just caught it. Down in the 
stream.” 

"That? In our stream?” 

“Yeah.” 

He looked at it. The fish re- 
sembled a small marlin in shape, 
but it looked as if its sides had 
been painted by an abstract 
artist. 

“They planted it on my hook,” 
he told her. “Teleported it from 
somewhere and planted it on me. 
Like the tigers.” 

“Who?” 

“I don’t know — one of the kids. 
There were a bunch of them down 
by the river.” 

“Is it the proof you wanted?” 

“Almost. I’d like to make them 
— whoever they are — admit it, 
though. But you can’t pry any- 
thing out of them. They stick to- 
gether like — like kids, I guess. 
Tell me, why is it that the smart 
ones don’t discriminate? They’d 
as soon play with morons like 
Hodge or Cress as with the brainy 
ones.” 

"Democratic, I guess.” Ann 
said. She looked at the fish with- 



90 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



out enthusiasm and turned it over 
on its other side. “Weren’t you 
the same way, when you were 
a boy?” 

“Guess so. Leader of my group 
was almost an idiot. Head of the 
3Rs now.” He started to put his 
fishing tackle away. “Got to get 
ready for Star Watch,” he said. 
“I’m on the early trick tonight.” 
He halted in the kitchen door- 
way, still holding the rod and 
creel. He looked back at the fish. 
“That kind of thing is likely to 
take all the fun out of fishing,” 
he told her. 

U sually, he found star 
Watch a bore. There were 
often Saucer sightings, it was 
true. He had had many himself, 
some of them very close in, but 
all that had become routine. At 
first, the government had tried 
shooting them down, but the at- 
tempts had ended in total failure 
and the Saucers still came, aloof 
and unreasonable, as if they did 
not even know that they were 
being shot at. Later, communica- 
tion had been tried — but with no 
better results. 

Now, when the Saucers were 
sighted, the Watcher phoned in a 
report, some bored plotter in Sau- 
cer Control took bearings and 
speed, or replied that they had 
the thing on radar. The next day, 
the score of sightings would be 
Spellcast — it was less exciting

than watching for grunnion. 

Tonight, however. Ward was 
excited. As he left his house, he 
set out at a fast pace for the 
school. He found Bobby in front 
of the boys’ dormitory. 

“What is it, John?” the boy 
called as he trotted over to the 
teacher. 

“How’d you like to come on 
Star Watch with me?” 

“All right.” They went down 
the street together. 

“I want to try something,” 
Ward told the boy. “I think I 
know how we can get in touch 
with the Saucer people.” 

“But they have tried.” 

“Yes, I know — with radio and 
blinker lights and all that. But 
maybe that’s the wrong way. 
Bobby, you're a telepath, aren’t 
you?” 

“I’m not very good at it and 
anyway I don’t think it’ll work.” 
“Why not?” 

“I tried once, but I couldn’t 
seem to get anywhere. They 
seemed — I dunno — funny.” 
“In what way?” Ward asked 
the boy. 

“Just sort of funny.” 

“Well, if we’re lucky, maybe 
we can try again tonight.” 
“Yeah,” Bobby said, “it’s prob- 
ably a good night for it. Full 
moon. Why do you suppose they 
seem to like the full moon, John?” 
“I wish I knew.” 

It didn’t look as if they were 

91 



going to have any luck. They 
had waited for two hours and 
Bobby was asleep on a bench in 
the small “duck blind” the 
Watchers used. Then John heard 
it. 

It was a high shimmer of sound 
and it gave him gooseflesh, as it 
always did. He couldn’t see any- 
thing yet. Then it appeared to the 
north, very low, like a coagula- 
tion of the moonlight itself, and 
he shook the boy. 

Bobby was awake immediately 
and, together, they watched its 
approach. It was moving slowly, 
turned on an edge. It looked like 
a knife of light. Then it rolled 
over, or shifted its form, and the 
familiar shape appeared. The 
humming stopped and the Saucer 
floated in the moonlight like a 
giant metallic lily-pad, perhaps 
a half mile away. 

“Try now, Bobby,” he said, 
attempting to keep calm. 

The boy stood in the moonlight 
in front of the blind, very still, 
as if collecting the silence out of 
the night. Once he shook his head 
as though to clear it and started 
to say something. Then, for a 
long minute, he held his face 
toward the moon as if he were 
listening. 

Suddenly, he giggled. 

“What is it?” Ward snapped, 
unable to repress his impatience. 

“I'm not sure. I thought it 
seemed something like a joke.” 



“Try to ask where they’re 
from.” 

A moment later, the boy shook 
his head. “I guess I can’t get 
anything,” he said. “All I seem 
to get is that they're saying, 
'IVe’re here.’ As if they didn’t 
understand me.” 

“All right. Try to get any- 
thing.” 

A moment later, the ship turn- 
ed on edge, or shifted its shape, 
and slid back into the sky. Ward 
picked up the phone and called 
Saucer Control. 

“Got it,” the bored voice said. 

He put down the phone and sat 
in silence, feeling sick with frus- 
tration. 

“Might as well knock off, Bob- 
by,” he said gently to the boy. "I 
guess that’s all for the night. You 
run along and hit the sack.” 

The boy started to leave and 
then turned back. “I’m sorry, 
John,” he said. “I guess I’m not 
very good at it. There’s one thing 
though . .” He hesitated. 

“Yes?” 

“I don’t think they know any 
poetry. In fact, I’m pretty sure 
of that.” 

“All right,” Ward said, laugh- 
ing. “I guess that’s the most im- 
portant thing in your life right 
now. Run along, Bobby.” 

A N hour later, his watch end- 
ed and he started for home, 
still feeling depressed at having

failed. He was passing the dormi- 
tory when he saw it. It hung in 
the air, almost overhead. The 
color of the moonlight itself, it 
was hard to spot. But it was not 
the Saucer that held him rigid 
with attention. 

Over the roof of the dormitory, 
small and growing smaller as it 
went straight toward the Saucer, 
he saw a figure, then another and 
then a third. While he watched, 
there was a jet of blue light from 
the object in the sky — ^the open- 
ing of an airlock, he thought — 
and the figures disappeared, one 
by one, into the interior of the 
ship. Ward began to run. 

It was strictly forbidden for a 
teacher to enter the dormitory — 
that part of the boys’ world was 
completely their own. But he ig- 
nored that ruling now as he rac- 
ed up the stairs. All he could 
think of was that this was the 
chance to identify the invaders. 
The boys who had levitated 
themselves up to the Saucer 
would be missing. 

He was still exultantly certain 
of this as he jerked open the doors 
of the first three rooms. Each one 
was empty. And the fourth and 
fifth, as well. Frantically, he pull- 
ed open door after door, going 
through the motions, although his 
mind told him that it was useless, 
that all of the boys, with a Saucer 
so close, would be out looking 
at it. 



Wait until they returned? He 
couldn’t remain in the dormitory 
and, even if he did, when they 
all came back, how could he find 
out which boys had gone up to 
the ship? They wouldn’t be like- 
ly to tell, nor would the others, 
even if they knew. Aimlessly, he 
went on opening doors, flashing 
his Watcher’s light. 

■pERHAPS there would be a 
clue in one of the rooms. Ex- 
cited again, he rapidly checked 
them, rummaging in closets, pick- 
ing up their sports things and 
their toys. Nothing there. Until 
he found the book. 

It was an odd-looking book, 
in a language he couldn’t read. He 
looked at it doubtfully. Was the 
script simply Cyrillic? Or He- 
brew? He stuffed it into his 
pocket and glanced around at the 
walls of the room. Pictures of 
athletes, mostly, and a couple of 
pin-ups. In a drawer, under some 
clothing, a French post card. He 
examined some of the objects on 
the dresser. 

Then he was looking stupidly 
at his hand. He was holding a 
piece of string with a ring attach- 
ed to it. And, just as certainly, 
there was something attached to 
the other end. Or it had been. But 
there was nothing he could see 
now. He pulled on the string 
and it tightened. Yes, there was 
a drag on the other end. but 



WHAT ROUGH BEAST?

there ivas ihothing he could see 
... or feel. 

He tried to reconstruct his ac- 
tions. He had been pawing among 
the things. He had taken hold of 
the string and had pulled some- 
thing attached to the end of it 
off the table. The thing had fall- 
en and disappeared — but where? 
It was stHI tied to the string, but 
where was it? 

Another dimension, he thought, 
feeling the hair stand up on his 
neck, the sudden riot of his blood 
as he knew he had found the 
evidence he wanted. 

He snapped off the light and 
groped his way rapidly down the 
stairs. Once on the street, he be- 
gan to run. It did not occur to 
him to feel ridiculous at dragging 
along behind him, on the end of 
a string, some object which he 
could not see. 

“/^KAY,” Ann said. “But what 
is it?” She sat on the divan 
looking at the book. 

“I don’t know, but I think it’s 
alien.” 

“/ think it’s a comic book. In 
some foreign language — or may- 
be in classical Greek for all we 
know.” She pointed to an illus- 
tration. “Isn’t this like the fish 
you caught? Of course it is. And 
look at the fisherman — his clothes 
are funny looking, but I’ll bet 
he’s telling about the one that 
got away.” 



“Damn it, don’t joke! What 
about this?" He waved the string. 

“Well, what about it?” 

“It’s extra-dimensional. It’s 
. .” He jerked the string with 
nervous repetition and, sudden- 
ly, something was in his hand. 
Surprised, he dropped it. It dis- 
appeared and he felt the tug on 
the end of the string. 

“There is something!” He be- 
gan jerking the string and it was 
there again. This time he held it, 
looking at it with awe. 

It was neither very big nor 
very heavy. It was probably 
made out of some kind of glass or 
plastic. The color was dazzling, 
but that was not what made him 
turn his head away — it was the 
shape of the thing. Something 
was wrong with its surfaces. 
Plane melted into plane, the sur- 
face curved and rejoined itself. 
He felt dizzy. 

“What is it, John?” 

“Something — something like 
a Klein Bottle — or a tesseract — 
or maybe both of them together.” 
He looked at it for a moment and 
then turned away again. It was 
impossible to look at it very 
long. “It’s something built to cut 
through our three-dimensional 
space,” he said. He dropped it, 
then tugged. The thing dropped 
out of sight and reappeared again, 
rolling up the string toward his 
hand. 

That was when he lost con-

trol. He lay down on the floor and 
howled in a seizure of laughter 
that was like crying. 

"John!" Ann said primly. 
“John Ward, you stop!" She went 
out of the room and returned 
with a glass half full of whisky. 

Ward got up from the floor and 
weakly slouched in a chair. He 
took a long drink from the glass, 
lit his pipe with great delibera- 
tion, and spoke very softly. 
“Well,” he said, “I think we’ve 
got the answer.” 

“Have we?” 

“Sure. It was there all the time 
and I couldn’t see it. I always 
thought it was strange we could- 
n’t get in touch with the Out- 
spacers. I had Bobby try tonight 
— he couldn’t do anything either. 
I thought maybe he wasn’t trying 
—or that he was one of them and 
didn’t want to let me in on it. 
He said they sounded — funny. By 
that, he meant strange or alien, I 
thought.” 



“Well, I’m sure they must be,” 
Ann said, relaxed now that John’s 
outburst was over. 

“Yes. But that’s not what he 
meant — he’s just a normal hu- 
man genius. He meant funny.” 
He lifted his hand. “Know what 
this is?” He held up the strange 
object on the string. “It’s a yo-yo. 
An extra-dimensional yo-yo. And 
you were right — that thing is 
a comic book. Look,” he said. 
He held the odd object toward 
her. “See this? J.H. — Jacky 
Hodge, one of the stupidest ones. 
It’s his yo-yo. But I was right 
about one thing. We are being 
invaded. It’s probably been going 
on for centuries. Invaded by mor- 
ons, morons with interstellar 
drives, super-science — super- 
yo-yos! Morons from the stars!” 

He began to laugh again. Ann 
went out to the kitchen for an- 
other glass. Then, after a while, 
she went back for the bottle.

GALAXY'S 

5 Star Shelf 



PRELUDE TO SPACE by Ar- 
thur C. Clarke. Gnome Press, 
$2.50: Ballantine Books, 35c 

T’m glad to be able to review 
this book, which first appear- 
ed as GALAXY Science Fiction 
Novel No. 3, back in 1950. I 
could only mention it then, since 
there was (and stUl is) a house 
rule against reviewing galaxy 
Novels: but here at last is my 
chance. 

For my money, Prelude To 
Space is the most real, most grip- 
ping and most unforgettable story 
of the making and laimching of 
the first manned Moon rocket 



ever written — and a good many 
have been. 

It is a description of a Brit- 
ish Commonwealth undertaking, 
with planning in England and 
construction in Australia. But ac- 
tually the project is for all hu- 
manity, since scientists of many 
nationalities work on it (Dirk 
Alexson, project historian and one 
of the chief protagonists, is an 
American), and since the end 
product of the flight — knowl- 
edge — will be available to all. 

There is little melodrama in 
the book, almost nothing but 
hard work, cooperation, endless 
planning and building. And at the

end, the reader is left with an in- 
escapable feeling that this is the 
way it will be, this is a genuine 
glimpse of future reality. It’s a 
magnificent book, and Gnome 
and Ballantine are to be con- 
gratulated on reprinting it. 

THE BEST FROM FANTASY 
AND SCIENCE FICTION, 
THIRD SERIES, edited by An- 
thony Boucher and J. Francis 
McComas. Doubleday & Co., 
$3.25 

■^OU can always expect de- 
lightful reading in the Bou- 
cher-McComas annuals, and this 
one is no exception. Sixteen 
items, ranging from superb, sci- 
ence fiction like William Lind- 
say Gresham’s “The Star Gyp- 
sies” to lovely fantasy like 
Manly Wade Wellman’s “Vandy, 
Vandy,” make up the book. Of 
the 16, there were only three that 
I couldn’t go for. 

There's also a much-to-the- 
point short introduction, about 
how science fiction and fantasy 
are primarily fun, which nobody 
should deny, but some stark- 
minded pseudo-philosophers of- 
ten do. 

Highly recommended. 

THE SINISTER RESEARCH- 
ES OF C. P. RANSOM by H. 
Nearing, Jr. Doubleday & Co., 
$2.95 



A DMIRERS of lihe “little 
round belly” that goes with 
Professor Cleanth Penn Ransom 
will (like the present reviewer) 
enjoy the Professor’s misadven- 
tures (with the ubiquitous Mac- 
Tate of the Philosophy Depart- 
ment as constant male Cassandra 
and companion) all over again in 
their ingeniously redesigned form 
in the present volume. 

To give the book the shape 
of a novel, Dr. Nearing (Ph.D. on 
17th century historical poetry) 
has added a new beginning and 
ending, and new connective tissue 
to tie together into a highly en- 
tertaining unit two new tales 
and seven that were first publish- 
ed in Fantasy and Science Fic- 
tion. 

Perhaps this high-level fun- 
ning will seem a bit rarefied to 
fanatics of “pure" science fic- 
tion, but to the rest of us. Pro- 
fessor Ransom’s surrealist under- 
takings will have an immediate 
and enduring appeal. 

The book should go on the 
shelf right next to Gava^an*s Bar 
and similar enchantments. 



THE CAVES OF STEEL by 
Isaac Asimov. Doubleday & Co., 
$2.95

ingenious - and meaningful ex- 
ploration of our distant tomor- 
rows. Even those who read it first 
as a serial in this magazine will 
want to read it again in its hard- 
bound form, for it delivers almost 
as much excitement on a second 
reading as it did on the first. 

The story is particularly fasci- 
nating to Asimov experts, because 
of the way it combines his inter- 
est in robotics with his consuming 
preoccupation with the sociology 
of a technology-mad, bureau- 
cratically tetiiered world of to- 
morrow. 

It’s a first rate detective story, 
too— -a suspense novel that will 
leave you breathless. 

SCIENCE FICTION CARNI- 
VAL, edited by Fredric Brown 
and Mack Reynolds. Shasta 
Pubs., $3.50 

TT’S often occurred to me that 
it might be a good idea to put 
together an anthology of funny 
science fiction, but I’ve been kept 
from it by the uncomfortable 
suspicion that one man’s belly 
laugh only too often is another 
man’s yawn. Unfortunately, the 
present collection confirms that 
suspicion. 

There are 13 tales in this book, 
of which I like 5 — those by Lein- 
ster, Tenn, Fred Brown himself, 
Eric Frank Russell, and a little 
satire by a Clive Jackson. The 



rest range from pretty fair (Mack 
Reynold’s entry) to not for me 
(all the rest). 

Of course, you may find the 
whole collection hilarious; so 
don’t go on my say-so. Better try 
the book yourself. 

WILD TALENT by Wilson 
Tucker. Rinehart & Co., $2.50 

f^HE best science suspense story 
Tucker has done yet takes 
you by the scruff of the neck 
and pell-mells you through a 
series of adventures that are all 
the more exciting because they 
are, on the surface, well-nigh mo- 
tionless. For this is adventure of 
the mind — the story (done be- 
fore, of course, but never better) 
of the first telepath and his 
struggles with a non-telepathic 
society. 

In this thriller, Paul Breen, an 
American, is brusquely though 
comfortably imprisoned, once his 
powers are known, by a Federal 
intelligence agency that builds up 
a worldwide espionage network 
around him as a human com- 
munications center. He can read 
the mind of everyone he has ever 
met (though not others), and 
over any distance. Thus, agents 
who are known to Breen need 
only to think their discoveries 
wherever they are and he will 
get the data. 

It’s a crisply written, thorough-

ly realized tale of the potentiali- 
ties of “psi” powers. Though not 
particularly subtle or profound, 
it’s guaranteed to keep you

for a fascinated couple of hours. 

SENTINELS OF SPACE by 
Eric Frank Russell; THE ULTI- 
MATE INVADER, AND 
OTHER SCIENCE FICTION, 
edited by Donald A. WoUheim. 
Ace Books, 35c 

'X'HE third “Ace Double Novel” 

-*■ is itself novel, inasmuch as 
half of the fat little book (320 
pages) is a collection of four 
never-before-anthologized short 
stories and novelets, all of them 
good. 

The full-length novel, Sentinels 
of Space, is a reprint, of course, 
and also good. The four shorter 
items include one by Russell, and 
one each by Murray Leinster, 
Malcolm Jameson, and Frank 
Belknap Long — a book bargain 
even if you already have the Rus- 
sell novel. 

STOWAWAY TO MARS by 
John Beynon. Nova Publications, 
London, England. Available from 
American science fiction book 
services at 35c plus postage 

A SIDE from a couple of in- 
herently improbable situa- 
tions, this is an interesting ad- 



venture story of the first space 
voyage to Mars. Most improb- 
able is the private construction 
of a spaceship by hero Dale 
Curtance and a staff of assistants, 
and next most improbable is the 
old chestnut about stowing away 
on a spaceship — particularly 
when, in this case, the stowaway 
is a girl, heroine Joan Shirring. 

Outside of these dubious items, 
and a faintly distasteful empha- 
sis on British nationalism (some- 
thing you don’t find in Clarke’s 
Prelude to Space, reviewed 
above), the story is effective. 

SPACE TUG by Murray Lein- 
ster. Shasta Publishers, $2.50 

TN this sequel to Space Plat- 
form, Murray Leinster has 
written a juvenile that has all the 
melodrama of the oldest-fashion- 
ed space opera, plus a lot of in- 
teresting technology rarely found 
in pure adventure stories. 

After many escapades, young 
Joe Kenmore and his buddies 
make the first landing on the 
Moon, which they do by helping 
the first ship maneuver down to 
the Moon’s surface with their 
own little “space tug,” just as a 
nautical tugboat helps ocean lin- 
ers into their piers. Lots of Iron 
Curtain sabotage is defeated, as 
is a psychotic American scientist 
who sees only futility in every- 
thing.

Plenty of excitement, indeed, 
though not much maturity. 

THE LOST WORLD by A. 
Conan Doyle. Permabooks, 25c 

TT is good to have this won- 
derful old chestnut back in 
print again, particularly since the 
price is low enough so that any- 
one can afford to buy and read 
what probably is Professor Chal- 
lenger’s greatest adventure. It 
seems lushly overwritten, of 
course, but to this wrinkled and 
balding reviewer, at least, that 
doesn’t make any difference. 

It’s an enormously effective 
tale about the exploration of a 
bit of prehistory imagined still to 
exist on top of an inaccessible 
plateau far up the Amazon. 

SPACE PIONEERS, edited by 
Andre Norton. World Publishing 
Co., $2.75 

Tl^ISS Norton’s second anthol- 
-L*-*- ogy is, like the first, aimed 
at the juvenile market, but there 
is nothing particularly juvenile 
about it. Of the nine stories it 
contains, four are first-rate, three 
acceptable, and only two below 
passing. 

Included are tales by Eric Rus- 
sell, H. B. Fyfe, Ray Gallun 
(two!), James Schmitz, Fritz 
Leiber, Ray Jones, Jerome Bixby, 
and K. Houston Brunner. 



The only thing wrong with the 
book is its slimness. You cannot 
present even a smattering of sci- 
ence fiction’s wealth of imagin- 
ings about space in nine stories, 
one of which (Russell’s) isn’t a 
space opera at all, but an alien 
invasion tale. 

THE STOLEN SPHERE by 
John Kier Cross. E. P. Dutton 
Co., $2.75 

T IKE so many other contem- 
^ porary science fictions, this 
British item has to do with the 
plots and counterplots surround- 
ing an attempt to launch an 
Earth satellite space station. It 
also deals at interminable length 
with the doings of a family of 
English trapeze artists, and with 
a bunch of incredible villains led 
by a magician and illusionist 
known as Rubberface. 

The whole thing is done in a 
nervous-chatty-quaint style that 
is something like a cross between 
William J. Locke, Mother Goose, 
Laurence Sterne and E. Phillips 
Oppenheim. 

It’s supposed to be for young- 
sters. If so, it’s only for young- 
sters who don’t mind being 
whimsy-whamsied on one page 
and scared witless on the next. 
There’s practically nothing at all 
about the space station — it’s just 
a bit of plot mechanism.

FELONY 

By JAMES CAUSEY 

Vogel started with crossword 
puzzles . and worked his way 
up to Man's greatest enigma! 



W HEN he was nine, 
Vogel almost killed 
another boy who inad- 
vertently scattered his half- 
completed jigsaw puzzle. 

At sixteen, he discovered the 
mysteries of the Danish Gambit, 
and cried. 

At twenty-two, he crouched in 
a foxhole on Okinawa, oblivious 
to tfie death bursting about him, 
squinting in a painful ecstasy at 
the tattered fragment of news- 
paper on his knee. His sergeant 
screamed in agony, then died at 
his elbow. Vogel’s face lit up. 
“Sby.” he said happily, scrib- 



bling. As crossword puzzles go, 
it had been a toughie. 

At thirty, he was Production 
Manager of Sachs Fixtures. His 
men hated him. The General 
Manager loved him. Tall, gaunt 
and ruthless, he could glance at 
any detail print and instantly 
pinpoint the pattern of final as- 
sembly, total man-hour budget 
and fabrication lead time. 

Once, he made a mistake. 

On a forty-thousand-dollar job 
lot he estimated too high on pro- 
duction scrap. When the final as- 
semblies were completed, they 
had two feet of bulb extension

left over. It disturbed him. He 
spent that evening in his den 
brooding over chessmen. His wife 
let him alone. 

Next day, he hired Amenth. 

PERSONNEL called that 
morning and apologized. “No 
experience, but amazing shop 
aptitude. He’s coming down to 
you for an interview.” 

“I want,” Vogel said into the 
phone, “three bench men. By 
noon. With shop experience.” 

Personnel was sorry. Vogel 
snarled and hung up. 

“Hello, please, sir,” said a 
voice. 

Vogel stared, icily. 

Meekness cowered in front of 
his desk. Meekness in the form 
of a small birdlike person with 
beseeching amber eyes. 

“I am Amenth,” he said, cring- 
ing. 

Vogel eyed the olive skin, the 
cheekbones, the blue-black hair. 
“A wetback,” he said. “Three 
men short and they send me wet- 
backs. You know sheet metal, 
buster?” 

“I am not of the understand- 
ing,” Amenth offered. “Experi- 
ence, no.” He beamed. “Aptitude, 
yes,” 

Fighting apoplexy, Vogel took 
him out into the shop. Amenth 
cringed at the howl of air tools 
and punch presses. Vogel con- 
temptuously took him by the 



arm and led him to a workbench 
where a wizened persimmon of 
a man performed deft lightnings 
with rivets and air wrench. 

“Benny, this is Amenth, He’s 
new.” Vogel pronounced it like 
a curse. “Get him some goggles 
from the crib, a rivet gun.” 

Vogel returned to his office 
scowling. The phone rang almost 
instantly. 

“Boss,” said Benny, “he’s from 
nothing — all thumbs with an air 
wrench and he don’t know alclad 
from stainless.” 

“Be right out,” Vogel said, 
hanging up. 

Before he had a chance to fire 
Amenth, the Fabrication Super 
came in with a production prob- 
lem. Vogel solved it, but it was 
almost an hour before he return- 
ed to Benny’s bench — and stared. 

Amenth was a blur of motion. 
His Keller chattered like a live 
thing. 

A furious sweating Benny 
snapped at Vogel, “You playing 
practical jokes? Look, this guy’s 
gone crazy, he’s fifty per cent 
under standard! Tell him to slow 
down before I file a grievance.” 
’ Amenth beamed. “I am of the 
aptitude,” he said. 

A queer deep tingle went 
through Vogel. The crystal de- 
light of challenge he felt when 
confronted by an apparently im- 
pregnable fianchetto. 

That was the first day. 



FELONY 



103 



A WEEK later, Vogel was 
compiling a progress re- 
port from completed shop trav- 
elers. Abruptly he scowled at 
one traveler, then said, “Charlie!” 
“Yes, sir,” one of -the planners 
said. 

“Why didn’t these galley pan- 
els go out for drop hammer?” 
Charlie peered at the form and 
whistled. “Somebody must have 
changed the planning sheet.” 
“Get me the story!” 

Charlie went hurriedly out in- 
to the shop. 

Some time later he returned 
with a pale dazed look, “It’s this 
guy in assembly,” he said. “Name 
is Amenth. He didn’t even read 
the traveler. Just looked at the 
attached detail print and decided 
to miter the edges, then reverse 
the flange with a weld.” He threw 
the completed part on Vogel’s 
desk. “Go ahead, check those 
tolerances,” he said whitely. 
“Right on the money.” 

Vogel walked over to a cal- 
culator and figured. There was a 
dreamy expression in his eyes. 
He said softly, “All fabrication 
in our own shop. A net saving 
of 93 cents per unit, or eight hun- 
dred dollars total. I believe you 
planned this item, Charlie.” 
Vogel fired him. 

That same afternoon Amenth 
came into the office on Vogel’s 
order. “Sir?” 

“Don’t you know how to read 



a traveler?” Vogel asked sternly. 

“It was a lucky accident.” 
Amenth looked terrified. “I just 
read the print — ” 

“And did what seemed logi- 
cal.” Statement, then a very quiet 
question. “What happened to 
your accent?” 

The little man looked blank. 

Vogel took a slow deep breath. 
“I’ve got a material planning job 
open," he said tightly. “Three- 
fifty to start. Interested?” 

For a moment he thought 
Amenth would lick his hand. 

The little man took to plan- 
ning sheets like a duck to water. 
He pored feverishly over blue- 
prints, turning out travelers in a 
steady flood. 

Vogel watched him. He went 
over to Personnel, requested 
Amenth’s employment applica- 
tion, read it and scowled. It was 
a masterpiece of anonymity. 
Birthplace: New York. Former 
Occupation: Laborer. Hobbies: 
None. He memorized Amenth’s 
address and returned the applica- 
tion. 

Vogel always ate lunch in the 
office with his expediters. That 
noon two of them got into an ar- 
gument about the planets. 

“I say there is life on Mars,” 
Pete Stone insisted stubbornly. 
“When the polar ice cap melts, 
the water runs along the canals 
and traces of green from growing 
vegetation can be spotted.”

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Which proves nothing,” Har- 
vey Lamb yawned. Lamb was 
chief expediter. “Man couldn’t 
live there, anyway. There’s not 
enough oxygen.” 

“You would be amazed,” 
Amenth said quietly, “at the 
adaptability of Man.” 

Vogel set down his thermos and 
leaned forward. “You mean Mar- 
tians, for instance, could live 
here, assuming they existed and 
had spaceships?” 

Amenth’s smile was infinitely 
bitter. “Until they’d go mad.” 
The talk turned to baseball. 
Vogel lit his pipe and gave 
Amenth a surreptitious glance. 
The little man slumped in the 
corner, bleak and withdrawn. 
This was delicious. 

■y^OGEL left the shop and drove 
* across town to Amenth’s ad- 
dress. It turned out to be an 
ancient rooming house on the 
West Side. Mrs. Reardon, the 
landlady, was an apathetic wo- 
man who brightened when he 
asked her about Amenth. 

“He moved in just three weeks 
ago.” Her face softened in recol- 
lection. “He was like a lost dog 
coming in out of the rain. Could- 
n’t hardly speak English and he 
wanted me to trust him for the 
rent. I must have been crazy.” 
Her nostrils flared. “Not that he 
hasn’t paid up. Are you a cop?” 
Vogel nodded as he took out 



his wallet. In it was his honorary 
sheriffs badge, but he doubted 
if the woman would know the 
difference. She didn’t. She led the 
way upstairs to Amenth’s room, 
worrying, and Vogel assured her 
they were only looking for a 
hit-and-run witness, that it was 
strictly routine. 

Amenth’s room was incredibly 
asceptic, barren of pictures, ash 
trays, dirty laundry, any of the 
normal masculine debris. Vogel 
got the stark impression of a 
convict’s cell. In the bleak dres- 
ser were two pair of socks, un- 
derwear, one tie. In the closet 
hung one white shirt . period. 
Everything wore an indefinable 
patina of newness. Two books 
graced the top of the dresser. 
Vogel recognized one of them, a 
text on fabrication and design 
which Amenth had borrowed 
from his office. The other was a 
child’s primer of English. 

“He stays in his room almost 
every night — ^reads mostly, and 
he speaks English much better 
now,” said Mrs. Reardoni “A 
good tenant — I can’t complain — 
and he’s quiet and clean.” 
She. described Amenth and Vo- 
gel shook his head. 

“Our man is about sixty, with 
a beard,” he said. “Funny co- 
incidence. It’s a strange name.” 

Mrs. Reardon agreed. 

Vogel drove back to the shop, 
whistling. 



FELONY 



105 



He did not go to his chess club 
that night, but went to the li- 
brary instead. He read about 
Flying Saucers, about space 
travel, about the possibility of 
life on other planets. Sometimes 
he chuckled. Once he frowned 
deeply and bit his lip. 

That night in bed, listening to 
his wife’s shallow breathing, he 
said, “Alice.” 

“Yes?” 

“Supposing you were lost on 
a desert island. What would you 
do?” 

“I'd build a raft,” she said 
sleepily. 

Vogel smiled into the darkness. 

Next day he made a systematic 
tour of the stockroom, scanning 
the racks of completed sub-as- 
semblies, the gleaming fixture 
components, the rows of panels, 
brackets, extrusions, all waiting 
like soldiers to march from the 
stockroom into final assembly. 

Vogel suddenly grunted. 

There, half hidden behind a 
row of stainless-steel basin as- 
semblies, was a nine-inch bowl. 
He examined it. The bowl was 
heavy and shiny. There was no 
part number stamp, and the 
metal was not alclad, not stain- 
less, not cad nor zinc. Five' small 
copper discs had been welded to 
the lower flange. 

Vogel carefully scraped off 
a sample with a file. Then he 
replaced the part in the stock 



rack and went into his office 
where he placed the sample in 
an envelope. 

That afternoon he ranged the 
shop like a hound. 

In the shipping crib, he found 
a half-completed detail that 
struck a chord of strangeness. 
Two twisted copper vanes with 
a crumpled shop traveler signed 
by Amenth. The next operation 
specified furnace braze. Vogel 
squinted at the attached detail 
print. It was a current job num- 
ber. 

He spent the next two hours in 
the ozalid room, leafing through 
the print files. The job number 
called for a deep-freeze showcase, 
and there were exactly two hun- 
dred and seven detail drawings 
involved. 

Not one of them matched the 
print in shipping. 

After an almost silent dinner 
at home, he sat smoking his pipe, 
waiting for the phone to ring. It 
rang at eight. 

“It’s platinum,” Carstairs said. 
Tim Carstairs was a night-shift 
chemist. “Anything wrong, Mr. 
Vogel?” 

“fJo.” Vogel paused. “Thanks, 
Tim.” He hung up, glanced at 
his fingers. They were shaking. 

“You,” Alice said, “look ready 
to call mate in three.” 

“I’m going over to the shop,” 
he said, kissing her. “Don’t wait 
up.”

TTE was not surprised to see 
the light on in the parts con- 
trol section. Amenth was writing 
planning sheets. 

“I don’t believe we authorized 
overtime,” Vogel told him mild- 
ly, hanging up his coat. 

“Just loose ends.” Amenth’s 
smile was nervous. “Tying up 
these burden charts. I’m on my 
own time.” 

“Thought I’d set up next 
month’s budget.” Vogel sat at 
his desk. “By the way, what did 
you do before you came here?” 

“Odd jobs.” Amenth’s lips 
twitched. 

“Your family live on the 
coast?” 

Sweat glistened on the little 
man’s forehead. “Ah — no. My 
folks passed on years ago.” 

Cat and mouse. 

“You've done good work late- 
ly,” Vogel yawned, studying the 
progress chart on the wall. Be- 
hind him he heard a soft exhala- 
tion of relief, the furtive rustle of 
papers as Amenth cleaned off his 
desk. 

When Amenth finally left, Vo- 
gel went over to his desk and 
methodically ransacked the work 
in process file. It took him two 
hours to find what he was look- 
ing for. 

One: A schematic detail on 
graph paper which resembled no 
type of circuit Vogel had ever 
seen. 



Two : Fourteen completed shop 
travelers on which were typed 
clearly, Call Amenth upon com- 
pletion. That was not unusual; 
most expediters wanted to be 
notified when a hot part hit In- 
spection. The unusual part was 
that no inspection stamp had 
been placed opposite the final 
operation of Inspect, Identity, 
Return to S^ock. Ergo, Amenth 
had inspected and stocked the 
parts himself. 

Three: A progress chart with 
dates, indicating four detail parts 
still remaining in fabrication. 
Final assembly date — ^tomorrow! 

The following afternoon, Vo- 
gel sat alone in the conference 
room. The door opened and 
Amenth came in. “You sent for 
me. sir?” 

“Sit down, Amenth. Let’s talk 
a while.” 

Amenth sat down uneasily. 

“We’re considering you for 
promotion,” Vogel said, silencing 
the little man’s protests with a 
deprecating wave. “But we’ve 
got to know if you’re ready. Let’s 
talk about your job.” 

Amenth relaxed. 

They talked shop for a few mo- 
ments, then Vogel opened a 
folder, took out his watch. “Very 
good,” he said, “Now let’s check 
your initiative potential.” As 
Amenth stiffened, Vogel reas- 
sured him, “Relax. It’s a routine 
association test."

For the next ten minutes he 
timed Amenth’s responses with 
a stop watch. Most of the words 
were familiar shop words and 
most of the responses were 
standard. 

"Job." 

“Escape,” Amenth said in- 
stantly. 

"Blueprint." 

“Create.” 

“iVoise.” 

“Hate.” 

"Want." 

“Homel” 

It was all so childish, so obvi- 
ous, and Amenth’s eyes were 
frightened amber pools when Vo- 
gel dismissed him. No matter. 
Let him suspect. Vogel studied 
the reaction results with grim 
amusement. 

Outside, the shop roared. 

And Amenth’s travelers sped 
the rounds: Issue material; Shear 
to size; Form on brake; Weld per 
print; Miter, drill, inspect, stock. 
One by one, the strange details 
were being formed, finished, to 
lie inert in the stockroom, to 
await final assembly. 

Assembly. 

Of what? 

Tonight was project comple- 
tion. 



■m/riDNIGHT. 

-L*-*- Vogel stood in darkness, 
leaning against the wall. He was 
tired. He had maintained this 



vigil for three hours. His right 
leg was numb and he started to 
shift position, then froze as he 
heard footsteps. Three aisles over, 
a light exploded, blindingly. He 
held his breath. 

From outside in fabrication 
came the muffled clang of drill 
press and power brake, the sounds 
of the night shift. He waited. 
Three aisles over, something mov- 
ed. Someone fumbled in the 
stock bins, collecting shaped 
pieces of metal, grunting with 
the effort of piling them on the 
salvage bench, now panting with 
impatience while assembling the 
parts. There was a hammering, a 
fitting together, a flash of light, 
a humming of power and finally 
a sob of relief. 

Vogel’s hand slipped into his 
coat pocket and grasped the gun. 
He moved silently. 

Amenth stood at the salvage 
bench, adjusting studs and con- 
necting terminals. Vogel stared 
at the final assembly. 

It was a helmet. A large sil- 
very helmet, connected to a night- 
marish maze of wiring, mounted 
on a rectangular plastic base. It 
hummed, although there was no 
visible source of power. Amenth 
put on the helmet with a feverish 
haste. Vogel chuckled. Amenth 
stood motionless. Then as his 
hand darted toward a stand, Vo- 
gel said sharply, “Don’t!” 

Amenth stared at the gun.

“Take it off!” Vogel’s voice was 
iron. 

Amenth slowly took off the 
helipet. His eyes were golden 
with tears. “Please,” he said. 

“Mars or Venus?” Vogel said. 
“Which?” 

“N-neither. You could not 
grasp the concept. Let me go. 
Please!” 

“Where?” Vogel prodded. “An- 
other dimension?” 

“You would call it that,” the 
alien whispered. Hope brighten- 
ed his face. “You want feome- 
thing? Wealth? Power?” 

It was the way he said the 
words, like a white trader offer- 
ing his aborigine captors glass 
beads to set him free. 

Vogel nodded toward the cir- 
cuit. “That hookup — you tap the 
gravitational field direct? Cosmic 
rays?” 

“Your planet’s magnet force 
lines. Look, I’ll leave you the 
schematic diagram. It’s simple, 
really. You can use it to trans- 
mute — ” He babbled on with a 



heartbreaking eagerness, and Vo- 
gel listened. 

“In my own world,” said 
Amenth brokenly, “I am a 
moron. A criminal moron. Once, 
out of a childish malice, I de- 
stroyed beauty. One of the sing- 
ing crystals.” He shuddered. “I 
was punished. They sent me here 
— ^to the snake pit. Sentence for 
felony. This — ” he indicated the 
helmet — “would have fused three 
seconds after I used it. So, in- 
cidentally, would this entire shop. 
I had no time to construct a 
feedback dispersion.” 

“Tell me about your world,” 
Vogel said. 

Amenth told him. 

Vogel’s breath hissed softly be- 
tween his teeth. All his life an 
unformed vision had tormented 
him, driven him toward perfec- 
tion. Abruptly the vision was re- 
ality. He smiled, moved forward. 
“You shouldn’t have told me.” 
Amenth saw the intent in his 
eyes and started to beg. Vogel 
cHpi>ed him behind the ear.

He put the helmet on, gingerly. 
The electrodes tingled against his 
temple and his grin was wry as he 
thought of Alice. Then he de- 
pressed the stud. 

Vogel sobbed. 

^OLOR blinded him, rainbows 
^ blared in sweet, sparkling 
thunder. He whimpered, covering 
his eyes. The music drowned 
him in a fugue of weeping de- 
light. Slowly he raised his head. 

He stood ankle-deep in gold 
crystals that stretched out for- 
ever in a splendid sea of flame. 
The crystals sang softly, aching- 
ly. to a silver sun in an emerald 
sky. A grove of blue needle trees 
tinkled in ecstasy on his left. 
And beyond those trees . 

The city sang. 

White spires foamed skyward 
in impossible cataracts of glory. 



A glissando of joy burned his 
eardrums, and he could not face 
that living splendor. It was the 
city beyond dreams, beyond leg- 
end, the city where all dreams 
end. He strode toward it, raptly. 

The crystals screamed. The 
blue needle forest lashed wildly, 
and terror shivered through the 
air in shrieking dissonance. 

From the blue forest, people 
ran. Beautiful people, with great 
golden eyes and scarlet tunics. 
They could have been Araenth’s 
brothers and sisters. They stared, 
horror and revulsion twisting 
their faces. They started toward 
him. 

Vogel understood. 

If destroying beauty on this 
world was a crime, then killing 
ugliness must be a duty. 

On this world, he was ugly —

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




At last, Mundin had a legal ease . two eraekpots who 
wanted to grab off the biggest corporation on Earth! And he had 
to revise the old adage to: "If you can't join 'em, liek 'eml'' 



SYNOPSIS 




G-M~L Homes, as the result of 
a ireat architectural advance, has 
become the biggest and most 




tory. Its bubble /louses, rather 
than being on the open market, 
go with contract status for those 
with jobs. 

Belly Rave or its local equiva- 
lent — and every city has one — 
is where those without contract 
status live, if existence in the 
wretched squalor of those brawl- 
ing thieves' dens can be called 
living. Neglected slums that 
once were suburban developments 
(“Picture Window, Expansion 
Attic for your Growing Pami7y”), 
Belly Rave, the future corruption 
of Belle Reve Estates, and its 
like are the neglected results of 
G-M-L’s breakthrough in archi- 
tecture. 

Charles Mundin, a criminal 
lawyer, starving because he was 
not fortunate enough to be born 
into one of the corporate-law 
dynasties, has had only one case, 
that of : 

Norvell Bligh, whose specialty 
is dreaming up bloody events for 
Field Days, the future equivalent 
of Roman circuses, and who 
wants to adopt his wife's daugh- 
ter Alexandra, born in Belly 
Rave of a previous marriage. 
Bligh, however, has been double-

crossed into loss of contract 
status and his bubble house, and 
has been moved into Belly Rave 
by a police convoy. Meanwhile, 
Mundin finds himself the reci- 
pient of a doubtful political favor, 
the case of : 

Norma and Don Lavin, off- 
spring of the Lavin who invented 
the bubble house and whose ini- 
tial is the L of G-M-L Homes. 
Through legal trickery after their 
father's death, Norma and Don's 
25 per cent share of all G-M-L 
stock has been tied up .. and 
Don, the victim of severe con- 
ditioning that has left him 
vacant-eyed, is unable to remem- 
ber where the stocks are or even 
to discuss the matter. He and his 
sister Norma live in Belly Rave 
with: 

RyaHy an old-time corporation 
lawyer, whose addiction to drugs 
has ruined his career, but who 
can still act as attorney of record 
while Mundin does the legwork 
and carries out Ryan’s strategy. 
Mundin realizes that Ryan’s 
strategy is clever — for G-M-L 
Homes, obviously worried by it, 
have had Norma Lavin abducted. 
With h^r gone and her brother 
a psychological blank — except 
when G-M-L is mentioned — the 
case looks as hopeless as Mun- 
din's future and as dangerous as 
living in Belly Rave, where, he 
suspects, he may wind up before 
long as a permanent resident/ 



N ORVELL was lying on a 
cake of ice. He kept try- 
ing to explain to some- 
one enormous that he was sorry 
for everything, that he’d be a 
good and dutiful son or husband 
or friend or whatever he was sup- 
posed to be, if only the someone 
would leave him alone. 

But that enormous someone, 
who couldn’t have been Norvell’s 
father, because Norvell didn’t 
even remember his father, only 
put his hand before his mouth 
and tittered and looked down 
from a long flight of stairs, and 
then, when Norvell was least ex- 
pecting it, reached out and swat- 
ted him across the ear and sent 
him skidding across the enor- 
mous cake of ice into the titter- 
ing face of Alexandra and the 
jagged, giant teeth of Virginia — 
Norvell woke up. 

He was very cold, very stiff. He 
looked dazedly around him. The 
living room. But — 

Yes. it was the living room. 
With the wall pattern off and no 
light except a sickly dawn from 
outside. All the walls were on full 
transparent and he was lying on 
the floor. The bed he had dialed 
out to sleep in had folded into 
the basic cube, dumping him on 
the floor. And the floor was cold. 

No heat — no power — the house 
was cold. 



114 



GALAXY SCIiNCE FICTION 



He got up, wincing, and sidled 
hopelessly to the window con- 
trol. It didn’t respond. The win- 
dows remained full transparent. 

H e knew what had happened 
and swore between clenched 
teeth. The skunks? Turning off 
the place without a word of warn- 
ing, at daybreak, without even 
giving him a chance to . 

Wearily, he began picking up 
his clothes from the floor where 
a rack had dumped them when 
it had folded back. Through the 
indecently transparent windows, 
he saw the other bubble houses, 
all respectably opaqued, with 
only their nightlights and entry 
lights. 

By the time he was dressed, he 
began to hear a clamor upstairs. 
His wife and daughter charged 
down in negligees, commanding 
him to do something about it. 

“Get dressed,” he said and 
pointedly disconnected his hear- 
ing aid. 

He rambled about the house 
while they did so. Absently, he 
tried to make coffee and gave up 
with a half-laugh when the water 
would not flow. The closets, 
drawers and dressers had re- 
jected all their contents, upstairs 
and down. Pushers had calmly 
shoved them out and the doors 
had closed and locked — to him, 
forever. He contemplated the dis- 
ordered piles of clothes and 

GLADIATOR AT LAW 



kitchenware and began to pack a 
traveling case. 

Two bored policemen wander- 
ed in; the door, of course, was 
no longer on lock. He plugged in 
his hearing aid, taking plenty of 
time about it. 

“Well?” he asked. 

They told him he had plenty 
of time — they weren’t in any 
hurry. “Take an hour if you 
need it, bub.” They’d tote him 
and his family and their stuff 
out to Belly Rave, help him pick 
out a good place. 

The moving had a golden 
moment. One of the cops help- 
fully picked up a suitcase. Alex- 
andra told him to remove his 
lilthy hands from — 

The cop clouted her and ex- 
plained they didn’t take none 
of that off Belly Rave brats. 

The police car handed Norvell 
a jolt. 

It was armored. 

"You — you get a lot of trouble 
in Belly Rave?” he guessed. 

The friendlier of the cops said, 
“Only once in a while. They 
haven’t jumped a squad car in 
six months, not with anything 
but pistols, anyway. You’ll be 
okay.” 

They pulled away from Mon- 
mouth G-M-L Unit W-97-AR. 
There was no sentiment to the 
parting. Norvell was sunk in 
worry, Alexandra was incandes- 
cent but still. And Virginia had 

115 



not said two words to anyone 
that morning. 

ri^HE car paused at the broad 
beltway circling the bubble- 
city, its motor idling, its driver 
impatiently talking into his radio. 
Finally, two more police cars 
rolled up and the three of them, 
in convoy, left the city roads for 
the cracked asphalt that led to 
Belly Rave. Once the road they 
traveled had been a six-lane 
superhighway, carrying a hun- 
dred thousand commuters’ cars, 
morning and night. Now it wound 
through a scraggly jungle and the 
toll booths at the interchanges 
had crumbled into rock piles 
and rust. 

They bumped along for a 
couple of miles, then turned off 
into a side road that was even 
worse. 

The first thing that hit Norvell 
was the smell. 

The second thing was worse — 
the horrible feeling of betrayal. 
Belly Rave, in its teeming ruin, 
was worse than anything Norvell 
had dreamed. 

The convoying cars pulled up 
ahead and behind. A cop got out 
of each and stood ankle-deep in 
weeds and refuse, a hand idly 
resting on his gun. 

Norvell’s driver said, “This one 
will do. Let’s go.” 

The act of moving their pos- 
sessions into the house in the 



driving rain, ringed by an audi- 
ence of blank-faced Belly Ravers, 
was mercifully blurred in Nor- 
vell’s mind. At one moment, he 
was sitting in the police car, star- 
ing in disbelief at the wretched 
kennel they were offering him. 
The next, the police cars were 
gone and he was sitting on a 
turned-up suitcase and Alex- 
andra was whining, “Norvell, 

I’ve to have something to 
eat before I absolutely die. It’s 
been — ” 

“Shut up,” Virginia said levcl- 
ly to her daughter. “Norvell, help 
me get the big suitcase upstairs.” 

She kicked a heap of rattling 
cans out of her way and headed 
for a flight of steps, ignoring her 
daughter. 

Norvell followed her up the 
narrow broken stairs. The upper 
floor — ^Expansion Attic for Your 
Growing Family, the billboards 
had said — ^was soggy with rain, ^ 
but Virginia found a spot where 
no water was actually dripping 
in. He dropped the suitcase there. 

“Go on down and watch the 
other stuff,” she ordered. “I’m 
going to change my clothes.” 

Before she got down, they had 
company — three men in ragged 
windbreakers. 

“Police,” one of them said, 
flashing something metallic in 
Norvell’s face. “Just a routine 
check. You people got any valu- 
ables, alcoholic beverages, nar- 



116 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



cotics or weapons to register?” 
Norvell protested, “The police 
just left.” 

“Bubble-town police, buster,” 
the man said. “They got no juris- 
diction here. Come on, what’ve 
you got to register?” 

N orvell shrugged feebly. 

“Nothing, I guess. Unless 
you count our clothes.” 

The men moved purposefully 
toward the bags. “Just clothes? 
No guns or liquor?” 

Virginia’s high, clear voice 
came down from the stairs. 
“You’re damned right we have 
guns! You bums scram before 
you find out the hard way!” 
Norvell, eyes popping, saw an 
old-fashioned revolver in her 
hand. 

“Just a minute, sister,” one 
of the men objected. 

“Beat it!” she snapped. 

They were gone, swearing. 
Virginia handed the gun to 
Norvell. “Keep it,” she said cold- 
ly. “Looks better if you have it. 
Just in case you were wondering, 
there aren't any cops in Belly 
Rave.” 

Norvell swallowed. He hefted 
the gun cautiously. It was far 
heavier than his unskilled imag- 
ination would ever have estimat- 
ed. “Where did you get this 
thing?” 

“Used to be Tony’s, before he 
died. There’s lesson one for you 



— you don’t live in Belly Rave 
without a gun.” 

Alexandra came forward with 
shining eyes. “You were wonder- 
fair she breathed. “Those de- 
testable brutes — heaven only 
knows what would have happened 
to me if just Norvell had been 
here!” 

She started to plant a wet kiss 
on her mother’s cheek. Virginia 
shoved her daughter away. “We’ll 
have no more of that cack. From 
now on, you're going to level 
with me — and with Norvell, too. 
Hear me? We can’t afford lying, 
faking, doublecrossing or tem- 
perament. The first bad break 
you make, I’ll sell you like a 
shot.” 

Alexandra’s face was a study 
in terror. 

“Sink or swim — you’re in Belly 
Rave now. You don’t remember, 
but you’ll learn. You’d better — 
fast. Now get out of here. If you 
can’t scrounge something to eat, 
go hungry. But don’t come back 
until sundown.” 

The child stood blankly. Vir- 
ginia took her by the shoulder, 
pushed her through the door, 
slammed it behind her. 

Norvell looked through a chink 
in the boarding of the cracked 
picture window and saw Alex- 
andra plodding hopelessly down 
the battered walk, weeping. 

Uncertainly, he asked Vir- 
ginia — the new Virginia — “What 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



117 



was that about selling her?” 
"What I said. You can always 
find a fagin or a madam for a 
kid. I don’t know how prices are 
now — when I was thirteen, I 
brought 6fty dollars.” 

Norvell, his hair standing on 
end. said, ‘‘You?" 

“I guess I was lucky — they sold 
me to a fagin, not into a house. 
He ran a tea pad. I helped him 
roll the clientele. That’s where 
I met Tony. Now, if there are 
no more useless questions, help 
me unpack.” 

T¥E helped her, his head whirl- 
ing. Without shame or apol- 
ogy. she had demolished the story 
he had painstakingly built up 
from her "accidental” hints 
and revelations over the years. 
The honest, industrious parents. 
The frugal, rugged life of toil. The 
warmth of family feeling, drawn 
together by common need. The 
meeting with Tony Elliston — 
glamorous, advantage-taking cad 
from the Field Day crowd. Not a 
bad fellow. "But not love. Nor- 
vell — not what we have.” 

He had thought himself clever. 
He had pieced it together into 
a connected tale, chuckling pri- 
vately because she couldn’t know 
how much she had "unwittingly” 
revealed. 

And all the while she had been 
a pickpocket in a dope joint, 
sold into it by her parents. 



There was a knock on the door. 

Virginia said, through her 
teeth. "If that brat’s come back 
before I told — ” and swung it 
open. She screamed. 

Norvell found he had the re- 
volver in his hand, pointing it at 
the middle of the hulking, snag- 
gle-toothed figure in the doorway. 

The figure promptly raised its 
enormous hands over its shock- 
haired head, grinning. 

“Don’t shoot, mister. I know 
I’m not pretty, but I’m harmless. 
Came here to help you oOt. Show 
you where to register and all. 
The name’s Shep. I’ll give you a 
fair shake. Show you the best 
places for firewood, wise you up

little girl. You want to sell her, 
I’ll get you a price. You want to

next to a guy who’ll start you out 
with hemp seed. If you got real 
money, I know a sugar dealer and 
a guy with a still to rent. I’m 
just Shep. mister. I’m just try- 
ing to get along.” 

Virginia said, “Keep the gun 
on him. Norvell. Shep, you come 
in and sit down. What do you 
want?” 

“Surplus rations,” the giant 
said with a childlike smile. "Cash, 
if you have any. I’m always des- 
perate, but right now I’m out 
of my mind.” His arm swept at 
the open door. "See the rain? 
It’s the front end of the rain-

bow, mister. See it? I have to 
catch it. And to catch it, I’ve got 
to have some crimson lake. Some 
other things, too, but the crimson 
lake. You don’t see crimson in it, 
do you? Well, you won’t see 
crimson in the canvas, but it’ll 
be there — in the underpainting — 
and, because it’s there, I’ll have 
the pot of tears, the bloody, 
godawful rainsweep caught 
gloomdriving down on two hun- 
dred thousand desolations.” 
Norvell, lowering the pistol, 
said stupidly, “You paint.” 

“I paint. And for fifty bucks 
I can get what I need, which 
leaves me only the problem of 
getting fifty bucks.” 

V IRGINIA said, “With your 
build, you could get it.” 
“Not like you mean. Not since 
I started painting. So I run er- 
rands. Any errands? I’ve got to 
raise the fifty before the rain 
stops.” 

Virginia appeared to come to 
a conclusion. “Norvell, give Shep 
fifty dollars.” He shot his wife a 
horrified look. That would leave 
them with eighteen dollars and 
sixty-five cents. But she wasn’t 
even looking at him. She told 
Shep, “You’ll work for it. One 
week’s hard work. The outhouse 
is probably afloat. The chimney 
looks like it’s blocked. We need 
firewood. This place needs patch- 
ing all around. Also, my husband 



doesn’t know the ropes and he 
might get in trouble. You’ll 
watch him?” 

“For fifty, sure. Want me to 
watch the kid?” 

“No,” she said shortly. 

“You know what you’re doing, 
lady. It’ll be rough on her. Can 
I have the fifty now? It’ll take 
ten bucks for the kid who does 
the running. I can’t miss this 
rain.” 

Norvell counted out fifty dol- 
lars and handed them over. 

“Okay!” Shep boomed hap- 
pily. “We’ll get my crimson lake 
out of the way, then registration.” 

They walked through the driv- 
ing rain to a tumbledown build- 
ing guarded by a rat-faced boy of 
twelve. Shep told him cryptically, 
“Got a message for Monmouth.” 

The boy hooted mournfully, 
“Wa-wa-wa-wa-wabbit twacks!” 

Norvell blinked. Kids — every- 
where — from nowhere! Gimlet- 
eyed, appearing silently from the 
rain shroud. 

Shep told them, “Like last 
time, but with crimson lake, too. 
Got it?” 

A haggard girl of perhaps thir- 
teen said dispassionately, “Cack 
like last time. The Goddams 
joined up with the Goering Gren- 
adiers. It’ll be a busted-bottle 
job getting through the West 
Side.” 

“I’m in a hurry, Lana. Can 
you do it or can’t you?” 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



119 



Mildly, she told him, “Who 
said ‘can’t’ — you or me? I said 
it’d be a busted-bottle job.’’ 

The rat-faced twelve-year-old 
said sullenly, “Not me. They 
know I was the one got Stink- 
foot’s kid brother. Besides, what 
about the Willowdale — ’’ 

“Shut your mouth about Wil- 
lowdale,” Lana blazed. The boy 
cowered away. “Bwuthcr wab- 
bits, inspection — harms.'” 

Jagged glass edges flashed. 
Norvell gulped in horror. 

“Good kids,” Shep said ap- 
provingly and handed Lana the 
fifty dollars. 

“Wa - wa - wa - wa - wabbit 
twacks!” she hooted and the kids 
vanished back into the shrouding 
rain. 

rpRUDGING after Shep 
through the floods, Norvell 
asked no questions. He had learn- 
ed that much, at least. 

The Resident Commissioner 
lived in an ordinary house, to 
Norvell’s surprise. He had exj>ect- 
ed to sec the man responsible for 
the allowances of thousands of 
people in a G-M-L. Certainly 
his rank entitled him to one. 

Then Norvell saw the Resident 
Commissioner. He was a dreary 
old political hack. He told Nor- 
vell vaguely, “Carry your cards 
at all times. Be sure and impress 
that on your wife and the little 
girl. There’s all kinds of red tape 



to getting duplicate cards, and 
you might go hungry for a week 
before they come through, if you 
lose these. As head of the family, 
you get a triple ration and there's 
a separate one for the wife. Is 
the little girl a heavy eater?” 

Norvell guessed so. 

“Well, we’ll give her an adult 
ration then. Lord knows there’s 
no shortage of food. Let’s see, 
we’ll make your hours of report- 
ing on Wednesdays, between 
three and five. It’s important to 
keep to your right hours, other- 
wise there’s likely to be a big 
rush here sometimes and no- 
body at all others. Is all that 
clear? You’ll find that it’s mostly 
better to travel in groups when 
you come down for your allow- 
ance. Shep can tell you about 
that. It — prevents trouble. We 
don’t want any trouble here.” 
He tried to look stern. He added 
pathetically, “Please don’t make 
trouble in my district.” 

He consulted a checklist. “Your 
ration cards entitle you and the 
whole family to bleacher seats 
at all bouts and Field Days.” 
Norvell’s heart was torn by the 
words. The rest was a blur. “Free 
transportation, of course — hope 
you’ll avail yourself — no use to 
stay home and brood — ^little 
blood clears the air — door always 
open ...” 

Outside, in the rain, Norvell 
asked Shep, “Is that all he does?”

Shep looked at him. “Is there 
something else to do?” He swung 
around. “Let’s get some fire- 
wood.” 

X 

A S a disappearing act, it was 
a beaut. Mundin had tried 
everything. No Norma Lavin. 
After Ryan’s phone call, the 
track was lost. 

He went first to the police, of 
course. When he told them Nor- 
ma Lavin was a Belly Raver, 
they tried not to laugh in his 
face. 

“Look, mister,” a kindly Miss- 
ing Persons sergeant explained. 
“People are one thing — Belly 
Ravers are something else. Are 
these people on the tax rolls? 
Do they have punch-card codes? 
Do they have employment con- 
tract identification tattoos? No, 
they don’t. So what can we do? 
We can find missing persons, sure, 
but this girl ain’t a person — she’s 
a Belly Raver. Maybe she just 
took a notion to wander off. May- 
be she’s got her toes turned up in 
a vacant lot. We just wouldn’t 
know, see?” 

But he took Charles Mundin’s 
name, just in case. Mundin fo\ind 
himself making regular trips to 
the Lavin-Ryan home, loaded 
down with groceries. He also 
found that Ryan was tapping 
him for cash to buy drugs. 



Don Lavin was sinking into a 
kind of catatonia without his 
sister. Ryan, alternately coldly 
confident with a bellyful of yen 
pox and devoured by the weeping 
shakes, begged Mundin to try 
something, anything. Mundin 
tried a doctor. 

The doctor made one visit — 
during which Don Lavin, spark- 
ed by some flickering pride, ral- 
lied wonderfully and conversed 
good-humoredly with the doctor. 
The doctor left, with an indig- 
nant glare at Mundin, and Don 
lapsed back into his twilight 
gloom. 

“All right, Ryan,” Mundin 
said bitterly, “now what?” 

Ryan shook the last pill out of 
the tin, swallowed it and told 
Mundin now what. 

And Mundin found himself 
calling on his -old schoolmate, 
William Choate IV. 

I3OOR Willie’s office was a little 
smaller than a landing field. 
He sprinted the length of it to 
embrace good old Charles. 

“Gosh!” he burbled. “I’m so 
glad you could come and see me! 
.They just put me in here, after 
‘ old Sterling died. It used to be 
his office, see? So when he died, 
they put — ” 

“I see,” Mundin said gently. 
“They put you in here.” 

“Yep. Say, Charles, how about 
some lunch?” 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



121 



“Maybe. Willie, I need a little 
help.” 

Willie said reproachfully, 
“Now, Charles, it isn’t about a 
job again, is it? Gee, that’s an 
awful spot to put me in.” 

Well. Mundin thought, they 
had succeeded in beating one 
thing into Willie’s head, though 
not two. “I just want a little ad- 
^Hce. I’d like to know when and 
where the annual stockholder’s 
meeting of G-M-L Homes comes 
off.” 

Willie said happily, “I don’t 
know. Don’t they have to pub- 
lish it somewhere? In a news- 
paper?” 

“Yes, they have to publish it 
in a newspaper, Willie. The trick 
is to find out what newspaper. 
There are maybe fifty thousand 
of them in the country and the 
law just says that it has to be 
published in one — not necessarily 
English language either.” 

Willie looked sorrowful. ‘T only 
speak English. Charles.” 

“Why don’t you ask your Pe- 
riodical Research Department?” 
Willie nodded vigorously. “Oh, 
sure, Charles — anything to oblige. 
Anything at all!” Willie uncer- 
tainly asked his squawk-box 
whether they had anything like 
a Periodjcal Research Depart- 
ment, and the squawk-box said, 
“yes, sir,” and connected him. 

Half an hour later, while Mun- 
din was deep in the intricacies 



of the preliminary pre-hearing of 
the Group E Debenture Hold- 
ers’ Protective Committee, the 
squawk-box coughed and an- 
nounced that the G-M-L Homes 
meeting was advertised in the 
Lompoc, California, Intelligencer. 
Time, day after tomorrow. Place, 
Room 2003, Administration 
Building, Morristown, Long Is- 
land. 

‘'Wbewr said Willie dubiously. 
“They won’t get many people to 
come there, will they?” 

“One too many,” Mundin said. 

'^HE next morning, Mundin 
was waiting at a two-dollar 
ticket window of the New York 
Stock Exchange when the open- 
ing bell rang. 

He examined the crumpled in- 
structions from Ryan nervously, 
as sweating and tense as any of 
the passionate throng of devotees 
pressing around him, but for 
other reasons. 

Ryan’s instructions were com- 
plete and precise, except for one 
thing — they didn’t tell him what 
bets to make. Mundin swore un- 
der his breath, shrugged and 
swiftly punched Number 145. 
Anaconda Copper. He inserted 
his token, threw the lever and 
tore off his ticket. At 19,999 other 
windows in the gigantic hall, 
19,999 other investors were doing 
the same. And outside, on the 
polychrome street, ten thousand 



122 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



latecomers were waiting for their 
turn inside. 

The angular Big Board in the 
center of the hall flashed and 
twinkled — ^fast, then slow. The 
lights stopped. The parimutuel 
computers began to hum. 

Mundin leveled his field glass- 
es on 145, but it was hard to stay 
on it. His hands were trembling. 

The gong rang and the line he 
was watching flashed: 

145, up 3. 

The great hall trembled with 
noise, of which Mundin’s obscene 
monosyllable was only the twen- 
ty-thousandth part. A lousy six 
cents profit. Not worth taking to 
the cashier’s window. 

A passing broker, a grimy 
Member’s button in his lapel, 
said intimately, “Hey, bud — 
watch metals.’’ 

“Beat it or I’ll have you run 
in,” Mundin snapped. He had 
no time to waste on phony touts. 
He swept his field glasses over 
the Big Board, trying to make 
some sense out of the first move- 
ment of the day. 

Industrials were down an aver- 
age of four, the helpful summary 
told him. Rails — ^meaning, most- 
ly, factory-site land develop- 
ments — ^wcre up three. Chemicals, 
up eight. 

Mundin figured — that meant 
the investors would lay off chem- 

GLADI ATOR AT LAW 



icals because they would figure 
everybody would be on chemicals 
because of the rise — except for 
the investors, who would be on 
chemicals because they would 
figure everybody would lay off 
chemicals, because they’d figure 
everybody would be on chemi- 
cals. Because of the rise. 
Thirty-second warning bell. 
“Bud,” said the broker insist- 
ently, **Watch metals!” 

“Go to hell,” Charles said 
hoarsely, his fingers shaking over 
the buttons.- He punched Ana- 
conda again, bought five tickets 
and waited. 

W HEN he heard the great 
groan at last, he opened his 
eyes and swept the board with 
his glasses. 

145, up 15 

“Remember who told ya,” the 
broker was saying. 

Mundin gave him a dollar. 
“Thanks, bud,” the broker said. 
“Don’t switch. Not yet. I’ll tell ya 
when. This is a morning crowd — 
Tuesday morning at that. Not a 
crazy hysterical Monday-morn- 
ing crowd that gets in fast and 
gets cleaned out fast. Look 
around and see for yaself. Little 
fellows taking a day off. The 
family men that play it smart — 
they think. Smart and small. I 
been watching them for twenny 

123 




124 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




years. I tell you, don’t switch.” 
Charles didn’t switch. 

He kept feeding a dribble of 
dollars to the broker, who was 
either lucky or a genius that day. 
By noon, Charles had a well- 
diversified portfolio of metals 
with a cash-in value of four 
hundred and eighty dollars. 

“Now,” the broker said hoarse- 
ly. He had borrowed Charles's 
field glasses to scan the crowd. 
“See? Some of them’s leaving. 
Some of them’s breaking out san- 
niches. The handle’s dropping. 
They’re getting not-so-smart 
now, not-so-small. I been watch- 
ing them twenny years. Now they 
start doing the dopy things, be- 
cause they’re gettin’ hungry and 
a hungry man ain’t smart. Sell 
twenny points short. Jeez, I wish 
I had the nerve to say thirty!” 
Two minutes later, he was 
pounding Charles on the back 
and yelling, “We made it, bud!” 
Metals had broken — thirty- 
eight points. Charles, by now icy- 
calm, gave him five dollars. Step 
One in Ryan’s instructions — 
build up a stake. He’d done that. 

He turned the dial to the $500 
range. “Give me a winner,” he 
told the tout. “I’m in a hurry and 
this is taking too long.” 

The broker stammered: “Solid 
fuels ought to rise now. But — 
but please, bud, make it $250. 
One on solid fuels and one on — 
on ...” He swept the board with 

GLADIATOR AT LAW 



his glasses. “Can’s been sleepin’ 
all day,” he muttered. “A Tues- 
day crowd stays off Can, but 
after metals break ...” 

He said nervously, “Buy solid 
fuels and Can.” 

*OY two in the afternoon, 
Charles had a cash-in value 
of $2,^00 and the broker’s pock- 
ets were bulging with small 
change. He was talking to him- 
self in an undertone. 

Charles said abruptly, “Okay. 
Now I want a share of G-M-L.” 
The broker blinked at him. 
“Old 333? You can’t do that.” 

“I want it.” 

“Bud, you’re new here; I been 
around for twenny years. They 
have an investor, see? All day 
long, he just punches 333. That’s 
him over there, third tier, second 
aisle. Like Steel and P & A — they 
don’t take no chances on any- 
body claimin’ no stock.” 

“I want it,” repeated Mundin. 
“Ain’t you made enough for 
one day? Come on, let’s go get 
a drink. I’ll buy. You fool around 
with the big boys, they punish 
you. Like G-M-L. You try to 
grab a share and you’ll get hurt. 
UnlrAited resources, see — un-/»m- 
it-ed. Every movement, all day 
long, he has a ‘buy’ bid in. He 
bids ten thousand bucks, way 
over real value. You get a wild 
idea and bid over ten thousand 
and you’ll get the stock, sure. So, 

125 



next movement, what happens? 
He sells short, maybe. Maybe he 
waits. But sooner or later you’re 
squashed. You know what they 
say, bud — ‘Him who sells what 
isn’t his’n must buy 'it back or 
go to prison.’ And plenty have.” 

Mundin said coldly, ‘‘What’s 
G-M-L par?” 

“Two thousand. But ya can’t 
claim it, didn’t I just tell you? 
He’s got a bid in, every move- 
ment.” 

Charles set himself to persuade 
the broker to do what Ryan had 
planned. At last, the broker, 
shaking, stumbled off toward the 
third tier, second aisle. Mundin 
followed him with the field 
glasses. 

It was working. Sweating, 
Mundin saw in miniature, 
through the glasses, the greeting, 
the silent shove, the wordless re- 
joinder, the growing heat of the 
quarrel. The G-M-L investor 
was a small, elderly fat man. The 
broker was small, too, but lean 
and wiry. 

The fight broke out as the 
thirty-second warning bell rang. 
Charles took his eyes off the 
the fighters and the for-once-un- 
tended investor’s window and 
punched four $250 tickets on 
Old 333. 

/^NE bid and no offerings did 
not constitute a transaction 
according to the electronic defini- 



tions of the New York Stock Ex- 
change parimutuel machine. As 
it had all day, the Big Board 
said — 

333, no change 

One bid and no offerings. In a 
claiming movement, it meant a 
quick profit — the difference be- 
tween the bid and the par value. 
An investor next to Charles, 
eying him respectfully, said, 
‘‘What do ya like in Chemicals, 
bud?” 

Mundin ignored him. He left 
his station, almost regretfully, 
and took the escalator up to the 
cashier’s window marked : Indus- 
trials — $1,000 and up. 

‘‘Two thousand dollars,” said 
the bored clerk, inspecting the 
tickets, glancing at his miniature 
of the Big Board, noting the 
no change. He began to count out 
hundred-dollar bills. 

‘‘I’m claiming,” Mundin said 
through stiff lips. 

The clerk suddenly awakened. 
‘‘Old 333! How’d you do it?” 

‘‘I’m claiming two thousand 
dollars par value.” 

The clerk shrugged and tapped 
out an order on his keyboard. 
Moments later, one share of 
G-M-L Homes voting common 
stock fluttered from a slot in the 
desk. The clerk filled in Charles’ 
name and home address and re- 
corded them. 



126 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“You’ll get that to the com- 
pany’s board of directors imme- 
diately?” the attorney asked. 

“It’s automatic,” said the clerk. 
“It’s in their files now. Say, mis- 
ter, if you don’t mind telling me 
how you pulled it off — ” 

He was being much too af- 
fable — and Charles, looking clos- 
er, saw the little ear plug of a 
personal receiver. He was being 
stalled. 

He darted into the crowd. 

The two gambles had paid off, 
Mundin realized, heading for the 
street and Belly Rave. He had 
the stake — and he had his single 
share of stock in G-M-L Homes, 
entitling him to a seat at the an- 
nual stockholders’ meeting. 

Now the real gambling would 
begin. 

Mundin whistled for a cab. 
There was some commotion be- 
hind him, but the cab came before 
Mundin had time to notice that 
the man who was being worked 
over, in broad daylight, by three 
huskies, was a small, wiry man 
with a Member’s button in his 
lapel. 

XI 

G etting on toward noon,” 
Shep said. “Let’s find a 
restaurant.” 

“A restaurant?” Norvie Bligh 
goggled. He followed Shep down 
the littered, filthy street, wonder- 



ing. In a week, he thought he had 
learned something about Belly 
Rave under Shep’s tutelage. But 
he had seen no neon-glittering, 
glass-fronted havens. 

What Shep led him to was just 
another Belly Rave house. A 
wheezing old crone crept around 
the living room. There was a fire 
going in the fireplace and water 
bubbling in a blackened kettle. 
Restaurant? 

Shep took a couple of rations 
from his pocket. He never seemed 
to be without a dozen or so. They 
were easy enough to get from 
the R.C. — you could claim you 
had a dozen dependents and he 
would apathetically list you for 
273 rations a week. If you could 
lift them, they were yours. There 
was plenty of food. 

And plenty of circuses. 

Shep split the two-by-three- 
by-six plastic box with his 
thumbnail and Norvell clumsily 
followed suit. Things tumbled 
out. Shep tossed one of the 
“things” — an unappetizing little 
block of what looked like plastic- 
wrapped wood — ^to the crone. She 
caught it and gobbled it down. 

“Business not so good?” Shep 
asked casually. 

She glared at him, bailed water 
out of the kettle with a rusted can 
and slopped it into his plastic 
ration box. Shep popped open a 
little envelope and sprinkled a 
dark powder on the water. 



GIADIATOR AT LAW 



127 



Coffee! The magic smell made 
Norvell suddenly ravenous. He 
handed the crone a similar block 
from his own ration, got his 
water, made his coffee, and greed- 
ily explored the other things that 
had come out of the box. 

Biscuits. A tin of meat-paste. 
A chewy block of compressed 
vegetables. Candy. Cigarettes. 
The combination was one he 
hadn’t encountered before. The 
meat-paste was highly spiced but 
good. 

Shep watched as he gobbled. 
“When you’ve eaten each menu 
ten thousand times — well, I won’t 
discourage you.” 

/^UTSIDE, Norvell asked shyly 
what in the world the old 
woman thought she was doing for 
a living. 

“It’s simple,” said Shep. “She 
gets her rations and trades them 
for firewood. She uses the wood 
to heat water — for coffee, or 
bouillon, or tea, or whatever. 
She trades the water for ra- 
tions. She keeps hoping that some 
day she’ll come out ahead on the 
deal. She never has.” 

“But why?" 

“Because it makes her feel like 
a human being.” 

“But — ” 

“But, hell! It’s hard to starve 
to death in Belly Rave; in a bad 
week, though, she comes close to 
it. She’s risking her capital in the 



hope of gain. What if she always 
loses? She’s doin^ something — not 
just sitting and waiting for ration 
day to roll around again.” 

Norvell nodded. He could see 
how it would make irresistible, 
unarguable sense, after the ten- 
thousandth of each menu. Those 
who could do anything, anything 
at all, would try anything, any- 
thing at all. 

It gave him a clue to the enig- 
ma named Shep. He said com- 
prehendingly, “So she has her 
restaurant, and you have your 
art, and — ” 

The giant turned on him. “You 
little louse! If you ever say, or 
hint, or think that I’m just pid- 
dling around to kill the time, 
I’ll snap you in two!” 

In a clear, intuitive flash, Nor- 
vell realized that he had said 
the unspeakable. He managed to 
say, very sincerely, “I’m sorry, 
Shep.” 

His knees were shaking and 
his heart was pounding, but it 
was only adrenalin, not fear. He 
knew what torment had driven 
this placid hulk to rage — 
incessant, relentless, nagging self- 
doubt. Where leisure is compul- 
sory, how can you tell the burning 
drive to create from its sterile 
twin, “puttering”? You can’t. 
And the self-doubt must remain 
forever unresolved, forever chok- 
ed down, forever rising again. 

Norvell added honestly, “I 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



128 



won’t say that again. I won’t even 
think it. Not out of fear of you. 
but because I know it’s not so.” 
He hesitated. ‘‘I — I used to think 
I was a kind of artist myself. I 
know what you must be going 
through.” 

Shcp grumbled, “Bligh, you’re 
just beginning to find out what 
you go through — but I’m sorry 
I blew my top.” 

“Forget it.” They walked on. 

A T last, Shep said, “Here’s 
where we get some more 
supplies.” The place was one of 
the inevitable picture-window, 
fieldstone-chimney ruins, but 
with a fenced-in yard. The gate 
had a lock on it. Shep kicked the 
gate down, tearing out the hinges 
and the staples of the hasp. 
Norvell said, “Hey!” 

“We do this my way. Stearns!” 
A grim, gray man threaded his 
way to them around stacks of 
plastic fittings, guttering and 
miscellaneous. “Hello, Shep,” he 
said flatly. “What do you want?” 
“You hijacked repair materials 
that a couple of friends of mine 
got through legitimate black- 
market channels. I want them 
back — with interest.” 

“Still on the protection kick, 
Shep?” the man asked, his voice 
ugly. “If you had any sense, 
you’d come in with me.” 

“I don’t work for anybody, 
Stearns. I do favors for a few 



friends, they do favors for me. 
Trot out your team, Titan of 
Industry.” 

Shep, so fast to resent the slur 
himself, was insensitive enough to 
use it on others. With the same 
results. 

Stearns’ face went pasty with 
rage and Norvell knew what was 
coming next — unless he moved 
fast. "Stearns!” he yelled, and 
used the moment’s delay to draw 
the pistol that Virginia had or- 
dered him to carry. Stearns’ hand 
stopped at his lapel and slowly, 
unwillingly, dropped to his side. 

Shep gave Norvell a quick, ap- 
proving glance. “Trot out your 
team, Stearns.” 

Stearns didn’t look away from 
the gun in Norvell’s hand. “Chris! 
Willie! Get the truck.” 

The truck was a two-wheeler 
stake job with one starved-look- 
ing teen-ager pulling between 
poles and another pushing against 
a canvas breast-band. Walking 
Stearns before him, Shep ordered 
him to pick up this or that article 
of building material and put it 
on the truck. He topped the load 
with a rusty pick and shovel 
from the tool shed, then told 
Chris and Willie, “Roll it, kids. 
It won’t be far.” 

Norvell didn’t pocket his gun 
until they had put three blocks 
between themselves and Steams’ 
final malevolent glare. 

There were two stops before 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



129 



they headed for Norvell’s home. 
At each of them, a part of the 
supplies was unloaded, to the 
tearful thanks of sober-looking 
citizens who had thought them 
gone forever — and^ with them, the 
months of accumulation, gam- 
bling and wangling that had 
earned them in the first place. 

Norvell, eying the heaving, 
panting teen-agers, suggested un- 
easily, “Let’s give them a hand 
with the truck.” 

Shep shook his head. “Our job 
is convoying.” 

TJUT there was no trouble. The 
kids rolled the cart to the 
door of Norvell’s house and un- 
loaded the firewood and building 
materials, stacking them on the 
shredded broadloom that covered 
the floor of the sunken living 
room. 

Virginia cast an appraising eye 
over the neat heaps. “No tar 
paper, linoleum, anything like 
that?” 

Shep guffawed. “No diamonds, 
either. You think your roof is 
the only one that leaks? You’re 
lucky — you got two finished 
floors. Let the top one get soaked. 
You’ll be all right down here.” 
“Cack,” she said and Norvell 
winced. “If you can’t get tar 
paper, see if you can find some- 
thing else to make shingles out of. 
Sheet tin will do.” 

“So will the roof off a G-M-L,” 



Shep said sourly, but he made a 
note. He tossed a couple of ra- 
tions to the waiting kids, who 
took them and pushed their 
empty truck away. “Anything 
else?” 

Virginia, suddenly a hostess, 
said, “Oh, I suppose not. Care for 
a drink?” 

Norvell, for politeness’ sake, 
took a sip of the bottle Virginia 
produced. “Ration- jack,” she 
called it, obtained by trading fire- 
wood with the evil-eyed octo- 
genarian in the house next door. 
It tasted like, the chewy fruit 
bars he had enjoyed until then, 
when he found them in his ration 
pack. But the taste was overlaid 
with the bite of alcohol. Beer was 
what he really liked. They didn’t 
seem to have any in Belly Rave, 
though. 

Norvell let the conversation 
drift past him. He sat back, bone- 
weary. Physical weariness was a 
new thing to Norvie Bligh. He 
had never had it as a child, never 
had it at General Recreations. 
Weariness was not one of the 
fixtures that came with possession 
of a G-M-L bubble house, it 
seemed. 

Why was it that doing nothing 
involved physical labor, while 
doing actual creative, productive 
work — running a Field Day, for 
instance — involved only the work 
of the mind? Norvie admitted it 
to himself : already he was taking

on the coloration of Belly Rave. 
Like all its discouraged, hope* 
less inhabitants, he was living for 
the day and ignoring the morrow. 
Rations and a place to sleep. It 
would not be long, he told him- 
self bitterly, before he would be 
one of the simians queueing up at 
Monmouth Stadium. 

Unless he found something else 
to do. 

But what was there to do? 
Work on the house? The essen- 
tials were done. The bars were 
up, the trash had been carted out 
into the street, where it would 
slump into a featureless heap like 
all the other middens along the 
road. The less urgent things 
couldn’t be done. You couldn’t 
fix the lesser roof leaks — no shin- 
gles. You couldn’t fix the stairs — 
no materials, no tools. Above all, 
no skill. 

TTE said excitedly, oblivious to 
the fact that he was inter- 
rupting, “Virginia! How about 
starting a garden? A couple of 
fruit trees— orange, maybe. A few 
rows of — ” 

Virginia laughed almost hys- 
terically. Even Shep chuckled. 
She said, “Orange trees don’t 
grow around here, my dear hus- 
band. Nothing else does, either. 
You start digging out there and 
first you go through two 
feet of garbage and trash, then 
maybe six inches of cinder and 

GLADIATOR AT LAW 



fill. Then you hit the real pay- 
dirt — sand.” 

Norvell sighed. “There must be 
something to do.” 

Shep suggested, “You could 
paint your dump, if you’re feel- 
ing ambitious. I know where 
there’s some house paint.” 
Norvell sat up, interested. He 
accepted the bottle of ration-jack 
and took a small swallow. “Why 
not? No reason why we can’t keep 
the place looking decent, is 
there?” 

Shep shrugged. “Depends. If 
you want to start some kind of a 
business, paint’s a good adver- 
tisement. If you want to just 
drift, maybe you don’t want to 
advertise. You make yourself 
too conspicuous and people get 
ideas.” 

Norvell said, dampened, “You 
mean robbers?” 

Virginia reached for the bottle 
of ration-jack. “Cack,” she said 
bluntly, taking a long swallow. 
“We aren’t painting.” 

There was a long pause. In the 
G-M-L bubble house, Norvell 
reminded himself. Virginia had 
never let there be any doubt who 
was boss — but she had seldom 
shown it in front of outsiders. 
They weren’t in the bubble 
house any more, however. 

I want Arnie, Norvell cried to 
himself, suddenly miserable. It 
isn’t working out right at all, not 
the way Arnie said it would. He’d

Grenadiers and it seems they 
pack knives and guns. They look

busted bottles.” 



said it would be a chance for 
Norvie to express himself, to 
make something of his marriage, 
to be on his own. And it wasn’t 
that at all! 

He reclaimed the bottle of 
ration-jack. It still tasted quite 
disgusting, but he gagged down 
a long drink. 

S HEP was saying, “ . didn’t 
do so badly today. Stearns 
gave me a little trouble. If Nor- 
vie hadn’t held a gun on him, I 
might not have got the stuff so 
easy.” 

Virginia looked at her husband 
appraisingly. But all she said 
to Norvie was, “You better keep 
an eye on that gun. Alexandra 
tried to sneak out with my kitch- 
en knife today.” 

“Eh?” Norvie was jolted. 

“Put on quite a scene,” her 
mother said, almost admiringly. 
“She’s getting in with the Goering 



132

“Does she have to do that?” 
Shep said grimly, “If she wants 
to stay alive, she does. Get it 
straight, Norvie — this is Belly 
Rave, not a finishing school. It’s 
a permanent Field Day, only 
without rules.” 

Now there was something he 
knew about, Norvell thought, 
brightening. “You ever go in 
for a Field Day?” 

“Nope. Just the weeklies.” 
“Oh, you ought to, Shep. 
That’s where the real money i?. 




OLADtATOR AT LAW 




And it’s not very dangerous if 
you play it smart. Take spear- 
carrying in Spillanc’s Inferno, 
for instance. Safe as houses. And 
from the artistic side, let me tell 
you from experience that — ” 

“Cack on spear-carrying, 
Bligh,” Shep said, with a wire 
edge in his voice. “I don’t do that 
any more. I've been there, stick- 
ing the poor slobs who fall off 
the high wire before they reach 
the blonde. I’ve even been on the 
wire myself— once.” He reached 
for the ration-jack, his face blank. 
“She missed me with all eight 
shots. I fractured her femur with 
my first. And then I dropped the 
gun.” 

He took a huge drink. “They 
booed me. I didn’t get the mid- 

133 



riff bonus or the navel super- 
bonus. I didn’t want them. All I 
wanted was some brushes, some 
canvas, some graphite sticks and 
some colors. I got them, Bligh, 
and I found out I couldn’t use 
them. Not for six damned 
months. And then I couldn’t paint 
anything except her face when 
the slug hit her thigh and she fell 
off the perch.” 

Norvell contemplated the ra- 
tion-jack bottle with distaste. He 
got to his feet, weaving slightly. 
"I — I think I want some air. 
Excuse me.” 

“Certainly,” said Virginia, not 
even looking at him. As Norvell 
went out the door, he heard her 
ask Shep, “This blonde you shot 
— was she pretty?”

1\^UNDIN was not followed 
from the Stock Exchange. 
He got to Belly Rave by late 
afternoon, his share of G-M-L 
Common securely tucked in a 
pocket. 

“Ah!” exclaimed Ryan, coher- 
ently jubilant. “One share voting. 
The meeting is tomorrow — and 
accessory before the fact to sim- 
ple assault. A good day’s work. 
Counselor.” 

“I hope this share is going to 
be enough to get me in,” Mundin 
said anxiously. “What if it isn’t 
entered or they challenge it?” 



“They can’t. Id cerium est 
quid reddi pofesf. Counselor.” 
“But affirmantis est probatio, 
you know.” 

Ryan grinned amiably. “Score 
one for your side. If they won’t 
let you in, we’ll have to think of 
something else, that’s all.” 
“You’ve been right so far, 
though.” Mundin stood up and 
took a turn around the dingy 
room, tripping over Don Lavin’s 
feet. “Sorry,” he said to the 
sprawling youth, trying not to 
look at the staring, shining eyes. 
There was an excellent chance, 
he realized, that what had hap- 
pened to Don Lavin might, soon- 
er or later, happen to himself if 
he persisted in sticking his nose 
into the corporate meatgrinders. 

Mundin asked, “Nothing new 
about Norma?” 

Ryan shook his head. “You’ll 
have to pry her loose from them 
tomorrow. Wish I could go with 
you ...” 

“Oh. by all means, come 
along,” Mundin said sarcasti- 
cally. “Love to have you. You’ll 
like Morristown — it’s so much 
like Belly Rave.” 

“I’d never stand the trip. You’ll 
have to play it yourself. Coun- 
selor. I have confidence in you. 
Just keep your head and remem- 
ber the essential nature of a great 
private utility corporation.” 

“A legal entity. A fictive per- 
son.”

The old eyes were gleaming 
in the ruined face. “Forget that. 
Think of an oriental court, a 
battlefield, a government, a poker 
game that never ends. The es- 
sence of a corporation is the 
subtle flux of power, now thrust- 
ing this man up, now smiting this 
group low. You can’t resist pow- 
er, boy, but you can guide it." 
He reached shakily for the bat- 
tered tin of pills. “Oh, you’ll 
manage. The thing for you to do 
now is to vanish. Get lost. Don’t 
be seen until you turn up at the 
meeting. And don’t go to your 
office or apartment.’’ He glanced 
meaningfully at Don Lavin and 
Mundin cringed. 

“What then?” Mundin de- 
manded. “You want me to stay 
here?" 

“Anywhere out of sight.” 

Mundin looked at his watch. 
If he could only go to bed now 
and wake up just in time to start 
for the meeting! But he had near- 
ly twenty-four hours to kill. 
Twenty-four hours in which to 
think and get nervous and lose 
the sharp edge of determination. 

“I’m going out,” he said. “I 
don’t know if I’ll see you before 
the meeting or not.” 

TTE said good-by to Don Lavin, 
who didn’t notice him, and 
wandered through the growing 
dusk of Belly Rave. He changed 
direction a couple of times when 



he caught sight of what looked 
like purposeful groups of men 
or children ahead, but there was 
actually small chance of attack 
before the Sun went down. 

He found himself nearing the 
General Recreations recruiting 
station and felt somewhat more 
secure in the shelter of the in- 
viting, pink-spun-candy-looking 
structure. General Recreations 
policed its area with its own 
guards. 

Mundin studied the gaudy 
posters and the shuffling, gossip- 
ing men and women. It was the 
first time he had come really close 
to the raw material that Stadium 
shows were made of and he felt 
a little like an intruder. He had 
seen the shows themselves, of 
course — plenty of them. He had 
gone religiously to the Kiddies’ 
Days back in Texas. As an ado- 
lescent, he had been a rootin’, 
tootin’ red-hot fan, as able as 
any to spout the log-book rec- 
ords on hours in combat, percen- 
tage of kills, survival quotients. 

Naturally, his enthusiasm had 
quieted down when the Scholar- 
ship people approved his appli- 
cation and he entered law school 
and he had never picked it up 
again. Nothing against the games, 
of course, but an attorney was 
expected to go in for more cere- 
bral forms of amusements. 

Like dodging creditors, he told 
himself bitterly. 



GLADIATOR AT LAW

Somebody called from the 
mob, “Hey, Mr. Mundin!” 

He started, half ready to run. 

But it was only whatsisname — 
Norvell Bligh — the client Dwor- 
cas had sent. 

But so shabby! 

Then Mundin remembered. 
Bligh had lost out on his contract 
— ^with General Recreations, iron- 
ically enough. But still, to find 
him here! 

The little man panted up to 
Mundin and wrung his hand. 
“My God, it’s good to see a 
friendly face! Were you — ^were 
you looking for me, maybe?” 

“No, Mr. Bligh.” 

Bligh’s face fell. “I — uh — 
thought perhaps you might have 
a message for me — as my attor- 
ney, you know — maybe the Com- 
pany . But they wouldn’t, of 
course.” 

“No, they wouldn’t,” Mundin 
said gently. He looked around. 
He couldn’t stand the little man’s 
misery, nor could he hurt him 
by walking away. “Is there any 
place we can have a drink around 
here?” 

“7s there! Mr. Mundin, the 
things I’ve seen in the week I’ve 
been here!” 

He led off, with Mundin fol- 
lowing. It was only half a block 
to the nearest blind pig. Bligh 
knocked. “Shep sent me,” he told 
a bitter-faced woman through a 
peephole. 



I NSIDE, the place reeked of 
alcohol. They sat at plank 
tables in the wretched living 
room and, through the sloppy 
curtains. Mundin saw the gleam 
of copper tubing and shiny pots. 
They were the only customers at 
that hour. 

The woman asked tonelessly: 
“Raisin-jack? Ration-jack? Ma- 
jun? Reefers? Gin?” 

“Gin, please,” Mundin said 
hastily. 

It came in a quart bottle. Mun- 
din gasped when she asked for 
fifty cents. 

“Competition,” Bligh explain- 
ed when she had gone. “If it was 
just me, she’d have sold it for 
twenty-five. But, of course, she 
could tell you were only slum- 
ming.” 

“Not exactly,” Mundin said. 
“Health!” 

They drank. Mundin felt as if 
somebody had smashed him on 
the back of the head with a 
padded mallet. 

Hoarsely, he asked Bligh, 
“How have you been getting 
along?” 

Tears were hanging in Bligh’s 
eyes. “It’s been hell, only one 
day of hell after another, and no 
end in sight. I wish to heaven 
I — ” He stopped himself, sat up 
straighter. “Sorry. Been drink- 
ing the whole afternoon. Not used 
to it.” 

“That’s all right.”

“Mr. Mundin, you can help 
me. Please! A big lawyer like 
you, candidate for the council 
and everything — 1 don’t expect 
a contract and a G-M-L. I had 
them and I was a fool — I threw 
them away. But there must be 
some kind of a job, any kind, 
enough so 1 can get out of Belly 
.Rave before I split right down 
the middle and — ” 

Mundin, thinking of his appeal 
to Willie Choate, said sharply, 
“I can’t, Bligh. I don’t have a 
job to give.” 

“Nothing I can do for you here, 
Mr. Mundin? I know the ropes — 
ask me!” 

It was a new thought. Mundin 
said uncertainly, “Why — why, 
as a matter of fact, there just 
might be something, at that. I’ve 
been trying to locate — a friend 
here in Belly Rave. A girl named 
Norma Lavin. If you think you 
could help me find her ...” 
Bligh looked at him express* 
ionlessly. “You want me to find 
you a girl?” 

“A client, Bligh.” 

“I can do it. I bet! I’ve got 
friends— contacts. Just leave it to 
me. I’ll handle it. You want to 
come along?” 

Mundin hesitated. Why not? 
His job was to stay out of sight. 
Until the stockholders’ meeting, 
at least. 

“Certainly,” he told Bligh. 
“Lead the way.” 

GLADIATOR AT LAW 



'DLIGH led him through the 
growing dusk to a vacant lot, 
the bumed-out site of one of 
Belle Reve’s finest 40>by-60-foot 
estates. And then the little man 
cupped his hands to his mouth 
and hooted mournfully into the 
twilight, “Wa-wa-wa-wa-wabbit 
twacksi” 

Mundin, stupefied, said, 
“What . ?” 

A small figure oozed from the 
dusk. It asked suspiciously, 
“Who wants a Wabbit?” 

Bligh proudly introduced Mun- 
din. “This gentleman is looking 
for a young lady.” 

“Cack, buster! Us Wabbits 
don’t—” 

“No, no! A young lady who has 
disappeared.” 

Mundin added, “Norma Lavin 
is her name. Disappeared a week 
ago. Lived at 37598 Willowdale 
Crescent. Drove an old Caddy.” 
“Um. That’s Gee-Gee terri- 
tory,” the shrill young voice 
informed them. “We got a Grena- 
dier PW, though. What’s in it 
for the Wabbits?” 

Bligh whispered to Mundin, 
“Ten dollars.” 

Mundin said promptly, “Ten 
dollars.” 

“For a starter?” 

“Sure.” 

"Come on.” The Wabbit led 
them a desperate pace through 
a mile of Belly Rave. Once, a 
thick-set brute lunged at them 

137 



from a doorway. The child snarl- 
ed, “Lay off. Wabbits!" The man 
slunk back. There had been a 
flash of jagged bottle glass in 
the little fist. 

They moved orr. Then, a 
mounting chorus down a street, 
rhythmic and menacing: “Gah- 
damn! Gah-damn! Gah-damn!" 

“In here!" The Wabbit darted 
into a darkened house. A startled 
old man and woman, huddled be- 
fore the cold fireplace, looked 
once and then didn’t look at the 
intruders again, having seen the 
busted-bottle insigne. The Wab- 
bit said to Mundin, “Patrol. 
This is Goddam territory.” 

They watched through cracks 
in the warped boards that 
covered the splintered picture 
window. The Goddams, still 
chanting, came swinging past, 
perhaps fifty of them, expertly 
twirling improvised maces. Some 
carried torches. 

The Wabbit, frowning, mut- 
tered, “That’s no patrol. War 
party, heading west. No noise. 
There’ll be a rear guard.” 

You could barely see them. 
They were black-clad. Their 
faces and hands were darkened. 

“All right,” the Wabbit said 
at last, and they slipped out. The 
old man and woman, still ignor- 
ing them, were munching rations 
and bickering feebly about who 
should chop up the chair to 
start a fire. 



^^HEY dived into a house like 
any other house, except that 
it was full of pale, snake-eyed 
kids from eight to thirteen. 

“Who’re these?” a girl asked 
the Wabbit. 

“Hello, Lana,” Norvie Bligh 
said tentatively. She shriveled 
him with a glance and turned 
again to their guide. 

“Customers,” he said shrilly. 
“Missing person. Ten bucks. 
And something important: War 
party of Goddams heading west 
on Livonia Boulevard, the 453- 
hundred block, at 7:50. Fifty of 
them with those hatchets of 
theirs. Advance guard and rear 
guard.” 

“Good,” she said calmly. “Not 
our pigeon: looks like a crib- 
house raid. Who’s the missing 
person?” 

Mundin told her. 

Like the Wabbit guide before 
her, she said, “Um. Goeririg Gren- 
adier territory. Well, we have 
one of them in the attic. Want 
us to ask him, mister — for fifty 
bucks?” 

Mundin paid. 

The Goering Grenadier in the 
attic was an eight-year-old scoop- 
ed up in a raid on the headquar- 
ters of the Grenadiers itself. At 
first he would only swear and 
spit at them. Then Lana took 
over the interrogation. Charles 
left abruptly. 

The Grenadier was still cry-

ing when Lana joined them down- 
stairs and said, “He talked.” 
“Where is she?” 

“Fifty bucks more.” 

Mundin swore and searched 
his pockets. He had thirty-seven 
dollars and eighty-five cents. 
Lana accepted twenty-five on ac- 
count. 

She said, “Seems there’s a Mr. 
Martinson. He has jobs for the 
Gee-Gees now and then. He told 
Grosse Hermann — that’s their 
boss — that he wanted this Lavin 
dame picked up and doped. They 
were supf>osed to deliver her to 
some place on Long Island. The 
kid didn’t go along, so he doesn’t 
remember just where. Says if he 
heard it, he’d ...” 

Mundin was tearing upstairs. 
To the weeping child, he barked, 
‘‘Room 2003, Administration 
Building, Morristown, Long Is- 
land?” 

“That’s it, mister,” said the 
kid, sniffling. “I told her I’d re- 
member!” 

ll/JUNDIN went back into the 
living room and leaned 
against a wall, brooding. So 
Norma was being kept on tap 
for the stockholder’s meeting. 
Why? More conditioning? A 
forced transfer of her stock? No 
— Don Lavin’s stock; she didn’t 
have any. She was the legatee — 
her brother Don had the stock, 
having her irrevocable proxy. 



So they would knock off her 
brother. 

Mundin said to Lana, “Listen. 
Yob saw that I have no more 
dough right now. But I need 
help. This thing is big. There are 
— well, thousands involved.” 
What a fool he would have been 
to tell the truth and say billions! 
“It’s big and it’s complicated. 
First, can you throw a guard 
around 37598 Willowdale? I 
think your friends the Grena- 
diers are overdue to kill a young 
man named Don Lavin.” He 
didn’t wait for an answer, but 
went right on, “Second, can you 
get me to the Administration 
Building in Morristown? You’ll 
be taken care of if this thing 
breaks right.” 

Lana measured him with her 
eyes. “Can do. We can haggle 
later.” 

She barked orders. A silent 
group of children collected their 
broken bottles from the mantel 
over the wood-burning fireplace 
and slipped out. 

Lana said definitely, “The Gee- 
Gees won’t get to your friend. As 
for Morristown — well, if the Gee- 
Gees can make a delivery there, 
I guess I can. Frankly, I don't 
like it. Morristown’s tough. But 
we have an arrangement with 
the Itty-Bitties there. They’re 
rats; they use guns, but ...” 

She shrugged helplessly. You 
gotta go along, her shrug said.

Mundin found himself escort- 
ed to the door. “Wait a minute,” 
he said. “I want to hole up some- 
where for the night. I’ll meet you 
here in the morning, but what 
about right now?” 

Bligh volunteered, “How about 
my place, Mr. Mundin? It isn’t 
much, but we’ve got bars on the 
windows.” 

Lana nodded. “That’ll do. In 
the morning — ^what now?” 

One of the Wabbits had slip- 
ped in the door. “Gee-Gee scouts,’’ 
he reported. “We got one of them, 
but there’s a couple more around. 
Might be a raid.” 

“We’ll fix them,” Lana said 
grimly. “Guess they want their 
boy back. Come on, you two— 
I’ll have to convoy you out of 
here.” 

She led the way. The street 
was black and silent. Before they 
had taken three steps, Lana was 
invisible. With some qualms, 
Mundin followed Bligh’s confi- 
dent stride. 

T ANA melted back out of the 
darkness and said, “Hold it! 
There’s one of the Gee-Gees un- 
der that fence.” 

Her bottle glimmered. Bligh 
choked and tackled her from be- 
hind as she was about to slice 
into a pudgy young-girl face. 
Lana floundered on the ground, 
swearing, while Bligh snapped at 
his stepdaughter, “Sandy, get 



the hell out of here. These are 
friends of mine. I’ll see you at 
home!” 

Alexandra, wriggling as he 
clutched her arm, said philo- 
sophically, “Sorry, Norvell. That’s 
the way the little ball bounces.” 
She threw back her head in a 
barking, strangling yell; “Sieg — 
heil! Sieg — ” 

Norvell held off Lana with one 
hand and, with the other, meas- 
ured the distance to Alexandra’s 
jaw. He knocked her out, heaved 
her over his shoulder and said, 
panting, “Let’s go, Mundin. 
You tag along, Lana.” 

After ten minutes, Mundin had 
to relieve the little man of Alex- 
andra’s weight. By the time Mun- 
din's knees were buckling, the 
girl was coming to. He put her 
down and she trailed sulkily 
along with them. 

Mrs. Bligh tried to raise hell 
when the four of them came in. 
“And,” she screamed at Norvie, 
“where have you been? Out of 
here without a word — gone for 
hours — we could have ...” 

Norvell said it was none of 
her business. He said it in such 
a way that Alexandra gasped 
with indignation, Lana with ad- 
miration. Mundin blushed at the 
language, but reflected that Belly 
Rave was doing things to little 
Mr. Bligh. And the things were 
not all bad. 

“And,” Norvell concluded, “if I

see any more monkey-business 
between that hairy ape Shep and 
you, there’s going to be trouble!” 
"Hah!" snorted Virginia Bligh. 
“I suppose you’ll beat him up.” 
“He could break me in two. 
I’d wait until he went away and 
then I’d beat you up.” 

Lana said sweetly, “I’m going 
now. What about this little 
stinker?” She jerked a thumb at 
the sullen Alexandra. 

“I’ll take care of her,” Bligh 
promised. “She didn’t know any 
better, that’s all.” 

Lana gauged him. “Okay. Be 
back in the morning.” She was 
gone as Virginia Bligh, regaining 
her breath, started in for the 
second round. 

Mundin said, “Please! I’ve got 
a hard day tomorrow— can I get 
some sleep?” 

XIII 

^^HEY spent the morning in 
-*• Old Monmouth. Mundin and 
Lana and Norvie Bligh, who tag- 
ged along in a sort of vague sec- 
retarial capacity. 

First, they stopped by Mun- 
din’s bank, where he plugged in 
his key, punched Close Account 
and scqoped up the bills that 
rolled out. 

He counted morosely. Two 
hundred thirty-four dollars, plus 
eighty-five cents in change. Lana 
looked hungry and Mundin re- 



called that he still owed her 
twenty-five dollars balance from 
the night before. He gave it to 
her and said, too cheerfully, 
“Let’s get something to eat.” 
They ate in Hussein’s. Lana 
said, “I've been here before. 
That ward-heeler E)worcas is 
across the street, isn’t he?” 
Startled, Mundin said, “That’s 
right. What were you doing 
here?” ■ 

“Things. Look, here comes a 
friend of yours.” 

It appeared to be one of Mun- 
din’s Ay-rab constituents-to-be. 
He said, “Effendi, I confess it. I 
was drunk when the day came 
and the judge insulted me.” 
Mundin said patiently, “I 
ought to tell you, Hamid, that 
I’m withdrawing from — ” He 
stopped in time. Careful, he 
warned himself — better let things 
ride until after the stockholders’ 
meeting. He amended it to, “I 
mean what’s the trouble?” 

“The inheritance from my 
father,” the Ay-rab said bitterly. 
“It is a matter of Clark v. Allen, 
91 L ed (Adv 1285), 170 ALR 
953, 67 S Ct 1431.” He was read- 
ing off a sheet of paper. “What 
this means, I do not know, but 
the judge insulted me.” 

“I’ll look it up,” said Mundin, 
taking the slip of paper with 
the annotation number on it. 
“What were you doing in court?” 
“My father died,” the Ay-rab 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



141 




explained. “There is a law that 
one must be a citizen to inherit, 
unless there is a treaty — and how 
can there be a treaty with Saudi 
Arabia, which no longef exists? 
I went to the court, Effendi.” 

"And you were drunk,” said 
Mundin. 

Hamid said gravely, "Effendi, 
it is even as your great poet Fitz- 
gerald so beautifully wrote — 
**Inderd the IdoU I have loved to 
long 

Have done my Credit in this 
world much wrong: 

Have drowned my Glory in a 
shallow Cup 

And sold my Reputation for a 
Song.” 

"Sure, Hamid, sure,” said 
Mundin. ‘Til look into it.” 



L unch continued without fur- 
ther interruption or much 
conversation. Over coffee, Lana 
said, brooding, "I guess the big 
shotsil ride out to Morristown 
in armored cars. Too bad we ain’t 
rich. Well, let’s get to the jump- 
ing-off place.” 

A taxi took them through the 
Bay tunnel to the Long Island 
Railroad terminus in Old Brook- 
lyn. Just for the record, they tried 
the ticket window. 

"No, sir,” the man said posi- 
tively. "One train a day, armored. 
For officials only. What the hell 
do you want out there, anyway?” 
They canvassed the bus com- 
panies by phone, without luck. 



142 



OALAXY SCIENCE MCTION 




Outside the railroad station, at 
the head of the cab rank, Lana 
began to cry. 

“There, little girl.” One of the 
hackies soothed her, glaring at 
Mundin and Bligh. A fatherly 
type. “What’s the matter?" 

“It’s my daddy,” Lana bawled. 
“He’s in that terrible place an’ 
he’s lost an’ my mommy said we 
should go help him. Mister, just 
take us to the edge, please? An’ 
Uncle Norvie and Uncle Charlie 
won’t let anything bad happen 
if those bas — if those bad men in 
Morristown try anything. 
Honest!’’ 

The hackie broke down and 
agreed to take them to the edge. 

GLADIATOR AT LAW 



It was a two-hour drive over bad 
roads. He let Lana ride next to 
him in the front. Swinging her 
little handbag gaily, with the vol- 
atility of a child, she chattered, 
all smiles, the whole way. Uncle 
Norvie and Uncle Charlie ex- 
changed looks. They knew what 
was in the little handbag. 

Morristown, being older, was 
better organized than Belly Rave. 
The driver stopped a couple of 
weed-grown blocks from the cus- 
toms barrier. 

“Here we are, little girl,” he 
said tenderly. 

The little girl reached into her 
handbag. She took out her busted 
bottle and conversed earnestly 

143 








with the driver. He cursed and 
drove on. 

At the gate, a couple of men 
looked genially inside. Lana 
whispered something — Mundin 
thought he caught the words 
“Wabbits” and “Itty-Bitties” — 
arid the men waved them on. A 
block past the gate, on Lana’s 
orders, the driver stopped at an- 
other check-point, manned by a 
pair of dirty-faced nine-year-olds. 

They got a guide — an Itty- 
Bitty with a carbine. On their way 
through the busy brawling streets 
to the Administration Building, 
grownups got out of sight when 
they saw him clinging to the 
cab. 

At the Ad Building, Lana said 
curtly to the driver, “Wait.” 

Mundin pointed to the steel- 
plated wheeled and tracked ve- 
hicles drawn up in the building’s 
parking lot. “We get out of here 
in one of those or not at all.” 

Lana shrugged. “I don’t get 
it, but all right.” She told the 
Itty-Bitty, “Pass the cab out, 
will you? And whenever you guys 
need something in Belly Rave, 
you know who to come to.” 

TT was one o'clock — the meeting 
was scheduled for one-thirty. 
The check-point in the lobby 
passed Mundin and Bligh on the 
strength of Mundin’s stock cer- 
tificate. Lana was to wait in the 
visitor’s room. 



Some twenty men filled the 
meeting room. Quite obviously, 
they were Titans. Beside these 
richly, quietly dressed folk, 
Mundin and Bligh were shabby 
interlopers. 

They were also ridiculously 
young and awkward. 

From here on, it gets hard, 
Mundin told himself. Corporate 
law! 

The vision blinded him with 
its brightness. 

Another new arrival was greet- 
ed cheerfully by the Titans. 
“Bliss, old man! Never thought 
you’d turn up for this nonsense. 
Old Arnold’s going to tramp all 
over you again, as usual.” 

Bliss was thin and younger 
than most of them. “If a couple 
of you gutless wonders would 
back me up, we’d stop him. Any- 
way, what else have I got to do 
with my time?” Then archly, 
“I did hear something or other 
about a Miss Laveme ...” It 
broke up in laughter. 

Mundin dove into the breach. 
“How do you do, Mr. Bliss,” he 
said breathlessly, taking the 
man’s hand. “I’m Charles Mun- 
din, Regular Republican candi- 
date in the 27th District — and a 
small stockholder here.” 

The thin man gently disengag- 
ed his hand. “It’s Hubble, Mr. 
Ermurm — Bliss Hubble. How do 
you do.” He turned to one of the 
Titans and demanded with mock 



144 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



belligerence, “Didn’t you get my 
wire. Job? Why haven’t I got 
your proxy for the contract 
thing?" 

“Because," Job said slowly, “I 
like old Arnold’s policies so far. 
You’ll rock the boat one of these 
days, Bliss — unless we kick you 
out of it first.” 

“Mr. Hubble," Mundin said 
insistently. 

Hubble said absently, “Mr. 
Ermurm, I assure you I’d vote 
for you if I lived in the 27th Dis- 
trict. which, thank God, I don’t.” 
His eyes were wandering. He 
headed across the room to but- 
tonhole another Titan. Mundin 
followed him in time to hear, 
”... all very idealistic, I’m sure, 
my dear Bliss. But many an 
idealistic young man has turned 
out to be a hard taskmaster. I 
mean no offense.” 

Bliss Hubble was off again. 
Mundin judged that this last 
Titan was .angry enough to talk 
to him. A vein was throbbing 
nicely in his reddened temple. 
Mundin asked in tones of deep 
disapproval, “Same old scheme, 
eh?” 

rjlHE Titan said angrily, “Of 
course. The fool! When young 
Hubble’s seen as many raids on 
management as I have, he’ll think 
twice before he tries to pull wool 
over my eyes. The contract thing 
indeed! He’s trying to shake the 



faith of all of us in the present 
management, stampede a board 
election., bribe — oh, in a gentle- 
manly way, of course — bribe him- 
self onto the board and then do 
as much damage as he can. But, 
by Godfrey, it won’t work! We’re 
keeping a solid front against 
him ...” His eyes focused. “I 
don’t believe I know you, sir. 
I’m Wilcox.” 

"Delighted. Mundin. Attor- 
ney.” 

“Oh — proxies, eh? Whom do 
you represent? Most of the chaps 
seem to be here.” 

“Excuse me, Mr. Wilcox.” 
Mundin followed Bliss Hubble, 
who had thrown himself into a 
chair after another rebuff. He 
handed him the power of attor- 
ney from Don Lavin that Ryan 
had prepared, 

“Hey? What’s this?” 

“I suggest you read it,” Mun- 
din said. 

There was a patter of applause 
as half a dozen men came in. 
One of them — Arnold — said, 
“Good afternoon, gentlemen. Let 
us all be seated and proceed.” 
Mundin sat beside Hubble, 
who was reading mechanically. 
One of the new arrivals began to 
drone out the minutes of the 
last meeting. Nobody was paying 
a great deal of atttention. 

Hubble finished reading, hand- 
ed the document back to Mundin 
and asked with an amused smile, 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



145 



“Just what am I supposed to do 
about it?” 

Mundin said sharply, “Looks 
foolish, doesn’t it?” 

Disconcerted, Hubble said, “I 
didn’t say that. And — well, there 
have been rumors. Rumors to 
which you might have just as 
much access as I.” 

Mundin looked knowing. 
“We're not going to be greedy, 
Mr. Hubble,” he said, wondering 
what he was talking about. “As- 
suming that I’m not a swindler 
and that isn’t forged, how would 
you like to be on the board?” 
“Very much,” Hubble stated. 
“We can put you there. Our 
twenty-five per cent voting stock 
plus your — ?” 

“It's a matter of record. Five 
and a half per cent. I vote the 
family holdings.” 

Mundin did sums in his head. 
Thirty and a half per cent. If 
they could take Hubble into 
camp and swing twenty per cent 
more . 

He faced front. Let Hubble 
think it over for a while. 

The minutes were accepted as 
read. One of the new arrivals 
grinned. “Now, gentlemen, to 
business. To begin with, election 
of a board member to replace 
Mr. Fennelly.” 

OOMEBODY proposed Mr. 
^ Harry S. Wilcox, the gentle- 
man with the throbbing vein in 



his temple. Somebody else pro- 
posed a Mr. Benyon and nomina- 
tions were closed. Secretaries 
moved among the stockholders 
with ballots, which they filled out 
after an inspection — ^brief and 
with deferential smiles — of the 
stockholders’ proxies and share 
certificates. Mundin blandly pre- 
sented his one share to a secre- 
tary’s horrified gaze. The man 
gave him his ballot as if he were 
passing alms to a leper. 

Wilcox won and there was a 
social round of applause and 
back-patting. From certain broad 
smiles, Mundin suspected the re- 
sult of the balloting was as fixed 
as the morrow’s sunrise. 

He grinned at Hubble, who 
didn’t seem to think it was at all 
funny. 

“Coming in with us?” Mundin 
asked. 

Hubble scowled. 

The chairman passed on to 
the matter of compensation of 
officers. Mundin gathered, from 
the reading of a long, involved 
statement of capital gains and 
tax depreciations, that the cor- 
poration officers didn’t think they 
were making anywhere near 
enough money. 

During the reading, stock- 
holders chattered sociably. Mun- 
din began to wonder why they 
had bothered to come, for the 
raise was lackadaisically approv- 
ed by a unanimous voice vote. 



146 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



At the next order of business, 
he found out why. 

It was called. “Diversification 
of Raw Material Sources, with 
Special Reference to Alumina and 
Silicates.” Mundin couldn’t make 
head or tail of the dull techni- 
calities, but he noticed that the 
sociable conversations tapered to 
a halt. One group, not more than 
four or five men, were putting 
their heads together with much 
figuring on the backs of envelopes 
and checking of records. Secre- 
taries were running in and out 
with books and sheaves of docu- 
ments as the reading droned on. 

At last, the chairman said 
genially, “Well, gentlemen, the 
question. Shall we save time by 
asking for a unanimous vote of 
‘Aye’?” 

A thin, gray old man rose and 
said, “I call for a record vote.” 
He looked at an elaborately un- 
concerned man in the first row 
and quavered menacingly, “And 
let me say to you gentleman that 
I’m going to keep a copy of the 
record. And I will be guided by 
it in reaching future decisions, 
particularly during the last week 
of the coming quarter. I trust I 
have made myself entirely clear.” 

The chairman harrumphed and 
the record vote was taken. 

proposition was defeated 
by a narrow margin, in an at- 
mosphere of restrained passions. 

GLADIATOR AT LAW 



Mundin sensed dimly that there 
had just been a pitched battle — 
a corporate Gettysburg, a trial 
of strength between two mighty 
groups, with millions a year as 
the least part of the unseen 
stakes. 

Hubble, beside him, was grow- 
ing restless. Mundin leaned over 
and whisp>ered, “You could hold 
the balance of power in a matter 
like that if you came in with us.” 

“I know. Let me see that paper 
again.” 

Mundin knew he had him. 

The meeting continued. 

There were three other clashes 
— Union Representation, Petition 
for Lowered Haulage Rates, and 
Committee to Study Design Im- 
provements. Each time the strug- 
gle, while Hubble read the spots 
off the power of attorney and 
fished for information. 

Mundin was noncommittal. 
“Yes, they’re clients of mine. No, 
sorry, can’t tell you just where 
Mr. Lavin is staying at present. 
I’m afraid. Yes, there is a sister. 
Mr. Arnold up there can proba- 
bly give you more information 
than I.” 

“Arno/d is in it?” 

“Up to his eye-teeth. He’ll 
probably attempt before long to 
— wait, here it comes now!” 

One of the colorless secretaries 
was mumbling, “Proposal to rec- 
tify an anomalous distribution 
of voting stock. Proposal is to 

147 



empower board to acquire — at 
par— dormant stock, dormant to 
mean stock unvoted since issue, 
provided time in question be not 
less than ten years, stock to be 
deposited in company treasury.” 
It sailed through the air of the 
room without raising a ripple. 

Mundin whispered, ”Ask him 
how much stock is involved. 
That’ll be your answer.” 

Hubble hesitated, then firmly 
rose, looking grim, and put the 
question. 

Arnold smiled. ‘T’m afraid we 
haven’t the exact figures. It’s 
more of a contingency measure, 
Mr. Hubble.” 

Hubble said, ‘Td be satisfied 
with an estimate, Mr. Arnold.” 

“No doubt. But as I said, we 
haven't got the figures. Now to 
proceed — ” 

Hubble began to look mulish. 
“Is the amount by any chance 
twenty-five per cent?” 

Throughout the room, people 
sat up and conversations broke 
off short. 

A RNOLD tried to laugh. Hub- 
ble snapped, “I repeat my 
question. Is or is not the 
amount of stock you are asking 
us to empower you to buy and 
deposit in the company treasury, 
under your control, twenty-five 
per cent?” 

As it soaked in, there was a 
mild uproar. Hubble ignored it. 



“Is it or is it not, Mr. Arnold? 
A very simple question, I should 
think! And if the answer is ‘no,’ 
I shall ask to sec records!” 
Arnold grimaced. “Please, gen- 
tlemen! Please, Mr. Hubble! I 
can hardly hear myself think. 
Mr. Hubble, since you have ob- 
jections to the proposal, we’ll 
withdraw it. I presume I have 
the consent of all present for 
this agenda change. To pass 
on — ” 

“You do not have my consent 
to this agenda change, Mr. 
Arnold. I am still requesting in- 
formation on the proposal.” 
Somebody slid into a seat be- 
side Mundin. a big, handsome 
well-preserved old man. “I’m 
Harry Coett. What’s this all 
about? I see you talking to Bliss 
and then all hell breaks loose. 
Say, weren’t you with Green, 
Charlesworth? No? Thought I 
knew you. Well, what’s up? Arn- 
old’s scared. You’ve got some- 
thing. What is it?” 

Mundin smugly asked, “What’s 
in it for me?” 

The man started. “Hell, boy, 
I’m Harry Coett. Where are you 
from, anyway?” 

A third party joined them as 
the debate between Hubble and 
the chairman raged and spread, 
“You seem to have put Hubble 
onto something, young man. I 
like spirit. Somebody told me 
you were an attorney and it hap- 

OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



146 



pens there’s a vacancy in our law 
staff. Quite a vacancy. I’m Road- 
ways, you know. George Nelson’s 
the name.” 

Coett snapped, “I was here 
first, George!” 

By then, the floor debate had 
escaped from Hubble’s hands. 
Scenting blood or gold, half the 
stockholders present were fighting 
for the chance to question Arn- 
old, who was sweating and grimly 
managing not to say a thing — 
at great length. The other half 
of the stockholders seemed to be 
clawing their way into the group 
around Mundin, the odd young 
man who seemed to know things. 

Mundin, smiling politely and 
meeting no one’s eye, heard the 
whispers and conjectures: “ — an 
attorney from the S.E.C., I guess, 
going to throw the book at old 
Arnold for — ” “ — into camp, but 
how do you know it isn’t Green, 
Charlesworth or — ” “No, you ass! 
Proxies! They’ve been quietly — ” 

J UDGING the time to be ripe, 
Mundin said politely, “Ex- 
cuse me, gentlemen,” and stood 
up. 

“Mr. Chairman,” he called. 
Arnold pointedly avoided his 
eye and recognized somebody 
else — who was at once the goal 
of a ten-yard dash by Harry 
Coett. Coett whispered urgently 
to the man, who said, “I yield 
to Mr. Mundin.” 



“Thank you,” said Mundin. 
“Perhaps I can clarify this con- 
fused situation. However, Mr. 
Arnold, first I should like to talk 
to one of my principals — the 
young lady.” 

“Principals?” Arnold asked 
distractedly. A secretary mur- 
mured something to him. “Oh. 
Miss Lav — oh, certainly. She’ll 
— uh — be free to talk to you 
immediately after the meeting is 
concluded. Is that satisfactory, 
Mr. Urmurm?” 

“Quite satisfactory.” 

And that was that. It was far 
more than he had dared hope 
for. Not only had he thrown an 
egg into the corporate electric 
fan, so that half the stockholders 
in G-M-L were swarming around 
him, but Arnold was returning 
Norma as his price for not 
“clarifying the situation.” Arn- 
old’s raid had blown up in his 
face. Far less than getting the 
Lavin stock to vote, he would be 
lucky to hold his domination of 
the board. 

Mundin sat down, comfortably 
— and silently — acknowledging 
leading questions and offers from 
the Titans with polite nothings. 

The stockholders’ rebellion be- 
gan to peter out. With Mundin 
quieted, angry and uncertain men 
perceived that some sort of deal 
had been made under their noses. 
They didn’t like it. They had 
done it themselves too often 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



149 



to enjoy feeling the spur on their 
own flesh. One of them called 
for unseating Arnold, but major- 
ity opinion was — wait until this 
Mundin tells what he knows. 

The rest of the meeting went 
at breakneck speed. 

Hubble spent much of it in- 
sisting. “Damn it, Mundin, you 
made me the first offer! The hell 
with these vultures. They’ll use 
you and throw you away. I’m 
the only heavy stockholder in the 
company with an open mind 
and — ’’ 

“Nonsense!” Harry Coett said 
decisively. “I don’t know what 
you’re up to, Mundin, but what- 
ever it is, it’ll need financing. 
And I’m Harry Coett. Let me 
handle — ” 

George Nelson said, “Tell him 
what you did to old Crowther, 
why don’t you? He needed fi- 
nancing, too.” 

T^FUNDIN never did find out 
what Harry Coett did to 
old Crowther. As the meeting was 
adjourned, he buttonholed Arn- 
old. who gave him a wan smile. 
“Come and see me, Mr. Mun- 
din. I’m sure we can get together. 
Don’t we know each other? 
Weren’t you with Green, Charles- 
worth?” 

“The girl. Arnold.” Mundin 
demanded. 

“Miss Lavin is waiting for you 
in the reception room.” 



Trailing tycoons, Mundin 
raced outside. 

Norma Lavin was there, pale 
and angry. “Hello, Mundin,” she 
said, not so crisply. “You took 
your time about it.” And then 
she was weeping on his chest. “I 
didn't sign it. I knew Don wasn’t 
dead. I didn’t sign. I — ” 

“Shut up, superwoman,” Mun- 
din snapped. “Stop giving things 
away to the eavesdroppers. Your 
every word is golden.” But he 
found that he was also shaking 
— from the reaction to the hours 
of strain. And unexpectedly but 
emphatically, from — Norma. 

He got a grip on himself as 
Coett, behind him, mused, “So 
this is the young lady Arnold 
horse-traded you, eh? Your prin- 
cipal. Counselor?” 

“Maybe,” Mundin evaded. 
“Oh, come off it, Mundin,” 
Coett said shrewdly. He turned 
to Norma. “My dear, can I drop 
you any place? You, too, of 
course. Counselor.” 

“Listen. Mundin,” Nelson urg- 
ed. “Get him to tell you about 
old Crowther.” 

“Damn it!” raged Hubble. “If 
you vultures will step aside ...” 
Mundin said. “I’ll lay it on 
the line, gentlemen. Miss Lavin 
and I have to stop in the waiting 
room to pick up an — uh — a young 
lady. In five minutes, we will be 
at the front entrance. We’ll go 
along with all three of you or 



150 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



with any two of you. You fight 
it out among yourselves.” 

He swept Norma out to the 
visitors room. Lana was perched 
on the receptionist’s desk, look- 
ing hostile — but not as hostile as 
the receptionist. Mundin asked 
her, “What happened to Bligh?” 
“Outside,” Lana replied. “He 
said he’d already had a belly- 
full of Field Days, whatever he 
meant by that. This your girl?” 
“Yes,” said Mundin. “This is 
my girl.” 

The three of them collared 
Norvie Bligh, sitting in the Sun 
outside, and started toward the 
ranks of parked cars and half- 
tracks. They were met by an 
amicable committee of three. 

“All settled, Mundin,” Hubble 
said happily. “Coett and Nelson 
are coming with us.” 

“Good. Where do we talk?” 
Hubble said joyously, “Oh, my 
place. You’ll like it — simple, 
quiet, but comfortable.” 

They made quite a procession 
— two cars and a halftrack. They 
didn’t stop for anything, neither 
the Itty-Bitty checkpoint nor 
the customs shed. In well under 
five minutes, they were on the 
open road for Hubble’s place. 

XIV 

T ANA was tugging at Mun- 
^ din's shoulder. “I want to go 
home,” she told him. 



Mundin said peevishly, “Sure, 
sure." Norma, exhausted, had 
fallen asleep on his arm and its 
circulation had been stopped for 
the past ten miles. The girl was 
a solid weight — but, he was 
thinking, a curiously pleasant 
one. 

“I mean now,” Lana insisted, 
“I got a duty to the Wabbits.” 

“I’d kind of like to go, too,” 
Norvie Bligh chimed in. “If you 
won’t be needing me, I mean.” 

Mundin eased Norma’s head 
off his arm. She stirred, mum- 
bled, “Arglebargle damn men 
think they’re ...” and was asleep 
again. 

Mundin flexed his arm, con- 
sidering. Lana and Bligh had ful- 
filled {heir bargains. There wasn’t 
likely to be much need for body- 
guards for the next little while — 
and not too much that Lana, for 
instance, could do, cut off from 
her gangs. 

He said, “All right. I’ll have 
the driver let you off at Old 
Yonkers and you can get a bus 
or something.” 

At Old Yonkers, their car stop- 
ped at an Inter-City depot. The 
car behind skidded to a stop be- 
side them. Hubble, Nelson and 
Coett — none of whom had trusted 
any of the others alone with 
Mundin and Norma for the ride 
— peered out anxiously. 

“Anything wrong?” Hubble 
yelled from a window.

Mundin shook his head and let 
Lana and Norvic out. 

Twenty minutes later, the 
motor caravan reached Hubble’s 
house. 

Quiet and comfortable it was — 
simple it was not. It was a 
Charles Addams monster in a 
fabulous private park in West- 
chester. They rolled up its drive- 
way and parked next to what 
apf>eared to be a 1928 Rolls- 
Royce limousine. 

Bliss Hobble was already at 
the door of the car, holding it 
open for them. “My wife.” he ex- 
plained, indicating the limousine. 
“She makes a fetish of period 
decoration. Today, I see, it’s 
Hoover — all last week, it was 
neo-Roman- Can’t say I care for 
it, but one has one’s obliga- 
tions.” 

“And one has one’s wife,” said 
Norma Lavin. who appeared to 
be back to normal acid self. 

“Oh. it’s quite nice,” Mundin 
said diplomatically. “So stately.” 

M rs. Hubble greeted them 
with dn unbelieving look. 
She turned to her husband with 
an explain-fhis-if-you-can air. 
Being a thin brunette with cheek- 
bones, she did it very well. 

Hubble said hastily, “My 
dear, may I present Miss 
Lavin ...” 

“Just ‘Lavin,’ please,” Norma 
said coldly. 



“Yes, of course. Lavin. and Mr. 
Mundin. You know Harry and 
George. Mr. Mundin has been 
good enough to compliment the 
way you’ve fixed up the house, 
dear.” 

“Indeed,” said Mrs. Hubble, 
ice forming on her gaze. “Thank 
Mr. Mundin and explain to him 
that his taste matches that of the 
housekeeper. Suggest to Mr. 
Mundin that he might consider 
employing the housekeeper, who 
has been out of a job since 1 
woke up this morning and found 
she had set the house for this 
unsightly, trashy piece of con- 
struction. Inform Mr, Mundin 
that when the housekeeper left — 
rapidly, I might say — she took 
off with all of the key settings, 
and I have been condemned to 
roam through these revolting 
rooms until my husband chose 
to come home with his keys so 
that I might change them to 
something resembling a human 
habitation.” 

Hubble stiffened, thrust a 
hand in a pocket, brought out a 
set of keys. His wife took them 
from him, turned and swept off 
through the vast, gaudy rooms. 

“Sensitive,” Hubble muttered 
to his guests. 

Coett said eagerly, “We got a 
couple of things straight on the 
way over, Mundin. Now ...” 

“Harry, I insist!” Hubble said 
severely. “Tm the host. Let’s not

rush things until we’ve had din- 
ner.” 

He led the way through a ma- 
jestic corridor, keeping carefully 
to the middle. 

He said sharply, “Watch it! 
Stand back!” 

The others, obeying his ges- 
ture, stood clear of the walls, 
which were in curious, shimmer- 
ing motion. 

“My wife,” Hubble explained 
with a glassy smile. “You’d 
think a regular bubble-house 
wall would be enough. No, noth- 
ing will do but full three-D illu- 
sion throughout. The expense! 
The stumbling home in the dark! 
The waking up in the middle of 
the night because the four-poster 
is changing into a Hollywood 
bed! She’s a light sleeper, you 
see ...” 

The walls had firmed up now. 
The old furniture was fully re- 
tracted and gone, new pieces had 
formed to replace them. Mrs. 
Hubble’s present preference ap- 
peared to be Early Wardroom — a 
satisfactory enough style for the 
flying bridge of a heavy cruiser, 
but not really Mundin’s idea of 
how to decorate a home. He 
pointedly did not comment on 
the steel-gray walls. 

The dinner seemed like a very 
good notion to Mundin. The 
tadjin ahmar he had eaten at 
Hussein’s seemed a very long way 
in the past. 



A SHAMBLING butler, wear- 
ing sharp dress blues, served 
them. His presence seemed to 
make Hubble jumpy. The table 
talk was not sparkling. 

“Am I to understand,” Hub- 
ble probed gently, “that Miss 
Lavin — that Lavin. I mean to 
say — was actually abducted by 
Mr. Arnold?” 

“Doubt it very much,” said 
Norma, chewing. “He probably 
just looked unhappy and said, 
‘Dear me, I wish something could 
be done about that outstanding 
stock.’ Some foot-kisser standing 
by set the wheels in motion. Arn- 
old’s hands would be clean. Not 
his fault if people insist on ex- 
ceeding their authority.” 

She took another forkful of 
wild rice. “They had me for 
about a week. God almighty, 
what confusion! I could go and 
I couldn’t go. I was free to leave 
any time I cared to, but tempo- 
rarily they thought it would be 
better if they kept the door 
locked. Sign your residuary lega- 
tee’s share of the stock to us and 
we’ll pay you a cool million. But 
we don’t want the stock, of 
course. It has only a certain small 
nuisance value. Now, lady, are 
you going to be reasonable or do 
we have to get tough? My dear 
girl, we wouldn’t dream of harm- 
ing you!” 

She scowled. “Arnold came to 
see me once. He kept pretending 



154

/ was trying to sell to him. I don’t 
know, maybe that’s what some- 
body told him. All I know is, I 
feel as if somebody hit me over 
the head with a lighthouse.” 
The shambling butler asked. 
“Are you at home to Mr. Arnold, 
sir?” 

Hubble said delightedly, “No! 
You hear that, Coett?” 

Nelson cut in, “Hold it a min- 
ute. Bliss. Are you sure you’re 
doing the right thing? Maybe if 
we all get together, we could — ” 
he looked quickly at Mundin — 
“that is, perhaps a// of us could 
freeze out the Toledo bunch.” 
Coett said, “Tell him to go to 
hell. Tell the butler to tell him, 
so we can hear you do it. First 
we settle things among ourselves 
— then we figure who else we have 
to cut in. My guess is nobody.” 
“Tell him,” Hubble said glee- 
fully to the butler. As the man 
shambled off, he turned to Nel- 
son. “Harry’s right, George. Fig- 
ure it out. You’ve got eleven per 
cent under your thumb, counting 
the voting trust. I’ve got five and 
a half, solid. Harry has three of 
his own and he influences — how 
many, Harry?” 

“Nine,” Coett said shortly. 
"Heavy influence.” 

“You see? That’s plenty, with 
these people’s twenty-five per 
cent.” 

Mundin kicked Norma’s foot 
under the table, just as she was 

GLADIATOR AT LAW 



opening her mouth to ask how 
they had located the stock. He 
said rapidly, “Don’t you think 
we should save this until dinner’s 
over?” 

Hubble cast an eye around the 
table. “Why. dinner’s over now,” 
he said mildly. “Let’s have our 
coffee in the library — it’ll be a 
little more comfortable.” 

TTUBBLE stopped at the en- 
trance to the library and did 
something with a switchbox be- 
fore permitting the others to 
enter. 

“Have my own controls here,” 
he said proudly. “Wife has most 
of the house — hah-hah — she can’t 
begrudge me one little den of my 
own. Let’s see if we can’t get 
something more cheerful.” 

The “library” — ^there was noth- 
ing resembling a book or micro- 
film in sight — shimmered and 
flowed, and turned into some- 
thing that looked like a restora- 
tion of a 19th Century London 
gentlemen’s club. 

Mundin tested one of the wing- 
back chairs and found it good. 
Norma was still looking at him 
suspiciously — but she was silent. 

He said cheerily, “Now, gentle- 
men, to work.” 

“Right,” said Harry Coett. 
“Before we get too deep, I want 
to know how we stand on one 
thing. I’m sure it’s just one of 
those crazy things that get start- 

155 



ed. but I heard somebody say 
something at the meeting. They 
said you were from Green, 
Charlesworth. Just for the rec- 
ord, are you?” 

Green, Charlesworth. Ryan 
had mentioned them, Mundin 
recalled. They seemed to be 
something to worry about. Mun- 
din said definitely, ‘‘We are not 
from Green, Charlesworth. Miss 
Lavin and her brother are the 
direct heirs of one of the founders 
of G-M-L. I — uh — happen to 
have a small amount of stock 
myself, as well as being their 
attorney.” 

Coett nodded briskly. ‘‘Okay. 
Then it's a plain and simple raid 
and we’ve got the strength to do 
it. I take it we are all agreed, 
then, that the first step is to 
throw the corporation into bank- 
ruptcy?” 

Mundin gaped. “What?” 

"Thought you were no ex- 
pert,” Coett sajd amiably. ‘‘What 
did you expect. Mundin?” 

“Why,” Mundin floundered, 
“there’s your stock and our stock 
and — well, majority rules, doesn’t 
it?” 

He stopped. They all were en- 
joying a polite laugh. Coett said. 
“Do you seriously think we could 
vote our stock outright under 
the existing rules?” 

“I don’t know,” Mundin said 
honestly. 

“You can’t. The proxies won’t 



stand for it. A raid, yes, but 
handled right.” 

Norma Lavin commented, “I 
suppose he’s right, Mundin. 
They’ve stopped us so far, one 
way and another. The only real 
change is that now these three 
ghouls know we’re alive and think 
they can easily take us to the 
cleaners.” 

“Please!” protested Hubble 
and Nelson. 

Coett, grinning, assured her, 
“You are absolutely correct. For 
the first time, I begin to doubt 
that we can do it.” 

Mundin interrupted, “Why 
bankruptcy?” 

They stared at him. Finally, 
Hubble asked, “How would you 
do it, Mr. Mundin?” 

■MUNDIN said, “Well, I’m no 
J-"-*- corporation lawyer, gentle- 
men — I leave that aspect of it to 
my colleague, Mr, Ryan, who is 
a member of the Big Bar. But 
it seems to me that our first step 
is, obviously, to form a stock- 
holders’ committee and request 
an accounting from the present 
board. We can back it up, if you 
think it necessary, with a notifi- 
cation to the S.E.C. I know that 
Arnold’s group will stall and at- 
tempt to compromise, probably 
offer us some kind of board rep- 
resentation, something far less 
than our holdings entitle us to. 
But that’s simple enough to 



156 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



handle. We simply protest and 
file suit in — ” 

"Risky,” Nelson objected. 
Coett said, “That won’t get us 
to first base. I remember when the 
Memphis crowd tried — ” 

"The who?” Mundin inter- 
rupted. 

"Arnold’s group. They took 
G-M-L away from the Toledo 
bunch eighteen years ago through 
due process, the way you’re talk- 
ing about. But it took six years 
to do it — and if the Toledo 
bunch hadn’t been caught short 
in Rails, Memphis never would 
have made it. And Toledo is still 
strong — you saw how Arnold had 
to put -Wilcox on the board to 
please them.” 



Mundin said desperately, 
"Can’t we at least try?” 

“Waste of time! We have be- 
fore us an immense mass of capi- 
tal. It has inertia, Mundin — 
inertia. You can’t move it with 
a feather — you need dynamite. 
It’s going to take time and brains 
to budge it. I’ll tell you how.” 
And he did. Mundin listened 
in growing bewilderment and 
something that came close to 
horror. Bankruptcy! How did 
you put a corporation worth 
fourteen billion dollars, emin- 
ently solvent, unbelievably pros- 
perous, into bankruptcy? 

He didn’t like the answers when 
he heard them. But, he told him- 
self, you can’t make an omelette

without breaking a few golden 
eggs. 

Coett, enjoying himself, was 
planning in broad, bright strokes. 
“Bliss, you get your chaps on 
the petition for composition and 
arrangement. We’ll spring that 
one ourselves, before they think 
of it. and we’ll want it ready. 
Then ...” 

Mundin, grimly taking notes, 
stuck through it to the end. But 
he wasn’t enjoying the practice 
of corporate law nearly as much 
as he had always thought he 
would. He wished urgently for 
the presence of old Ryan. And 
a nice full box of opium pills. 

TT was nearly midnight. Mun- 
din had never felt so drained 
in his life. Even Norma Lavin 
slumped in her chair. Coett, 
Hubble and Nelson were bright- 
eyed and eager, skilled techni- 
cians doing the work they best 
knew how to do. 

But the work was done. Mun- 
din, yawning, dragged himself to 
his feet. He said tiredly, “So the 
first thing for me to do is set 
up offices, eh?” 

Harry Coett sighed. “Not quite 
the first thing, Mundin.” 

“What then?” 

“Call it a matter of personal 
satisfaction. We’ve all heard ru- 
mors about young Lavin. I don’t 
say they’re true. I don’t know if 
they are or not. But if they’re 



true, we don’t get off the ground.” 
Mundin blazed, “See here, 
Coett — ” 

“Hold on. We’ve all had a look 
at that paper of yours. It’s a 
power of attorney, all right, and 
I’ve no doubt that it’s valid. But 
it isn’t a proxy, Mundin. It 
doesn’t mention G-M-L stock 
in it anywhere, except in the af- 
fidavit at the end — and Don La- 
vin didn’t sign that himself.” 
“What do you want?” 

Coett said, “Let me tell a fan- 
tastic story. Mind you, I don’t 
say it’s true. But it’s interesting. 
There are two young people, a 
brother and sister, for instance. 
One of them has some stock, but 
can’t use it. The other is — tem- 
porarily out of circulation. Let’s 
suppose that a smart young law- 
yer gets hold of them. First thing 
he does, he walks in on a meeting 
and lets it be known that the 
stock exists. With that as a 
wedge, he pries the girl loose 
from wherever she is. 

“With the girl, he sucks in 
three good, dumb Joes — like 
Hubble, Nelson and me, for in- 
stance. With the dumb Joes in 
the palm of his hand, he squeezes 
recognition of the stock out of, 
for instance, Arnold. That’s pret- 
ty good work — he has the girl 
and he has the stock. The ques- 
tion is, what do the dumb Joes 
have then?” 

God! thought Mundin. And I 



158 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



never believed in mind-reading! 
He said, “Am I supposed to take 
this fantasy seriously?” 

“Of course not. Just for the 
sake of the record, before we get 
too far involved in any of this, 
let’s see the stock. Will tomorrow 
morning be time enough?” 
“Tomorrow morning will be 
fine.” Mundin said hollowly. 
“Come, Norma.” 

Hubble’s chauffeur — now driv- 
ing what appeared to be an ad- 
miral’s staff car— convoyed them 
home. The house, from outside, 
had become a gray stone and ivy 
barracks. Mundin watched it 
dwindle behind them. 

Since he was pretty sure the 
chauffeur was under orders to 
hear anything they said, they 
didn’t talk. 

So it wasn’t until they were 
back in Belly Rave that Norma 
asked bitterly. “Well, Mundin? 



Is tomorrow morning time 
enough to locate the stock?”

FORECAST 

Neat month'i conclusion of GLADIATOR AT LAW by Frederik Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth 
draws its concsoled weapons and blasts its way to a furious climax. Never has there been 
a more one-sided battle— o handful of nobodies, armed only with ingenuity and audacity, 
against the greatest concentration of financial and economic power in all historyl The 
stakes, though, are larger than money or influence; they're the fulfillment of a dead man's 
dreoml And speaking of dreams— now that you've seen whot has happened to the New 
York Stock Exchange, wait till you meet the horrors that occupy the Empire State Buildingl 
A few In the past have known they existed, but now you will see them for yourself . 
and wonder where they are todoy and what they ore doing . ond what's in it for them. 

William Tenn's novelet, PARTY OP THE TWO PARTS, is probably the most bewildering 
and exasperating interstellar detection and legal problem ever explored before the fact. 
If It doesn't have you rolling on the rug, you should have your funny-bone checked 
and oiledl

THE AMERICAN HUMANIST ASSOCIATION 



in cooperation with 

GALAXY MAGAZINE 

announces its third annual 

STORY CONTEST 

llmlletl lo shorl stories with a scienee fiction theme by college iinJergraduafes only 

$750 FIRST PRIZE 



llumanivn may be described in brief as the belief that Man must solve his own problems, 
and that by far the strongest tool he has ever developed for problem-solving is scientific 
method. This theme pervades much of modern fiction of all types, and may be termed 
almost a working definition of the best science fiction. We would classify as ‘'humanistic'' 
most of the stories appearing in GALAXY Science Fiction Magazine. 

In order lo discover competent new writers of humanistic science fiction, the American 
Humanist Association and GALAXY Science Fiction Magazine have agreed to co-sponsor 
a Humanist Science Fiction Short Story Contest. The object of this contest is to find GOOD 
fiction-we are not interested in thinly disguised sermons. Although stories entered in the 
contest should have a humanistic approach, chief weight in the judging will be given to 
freshness of theme, sharp characteriration and interpersonal conflict, and ingenuity of plot 
development and solution of the problem used as the basis of the story. Entrants who are 
not familiar with science fiction should study GALAXY, available for 35c at most news- 
stands, or from 421 Hudson Street, New York 14, N. Y. 



All prize-winning stories will be printed in GALAXY. The first-prize story will also 
appear in The Humanist. For further information on the contest and literature describing 
the Humanist viewpoint, write lo Humanist Story Contest, Yellow Springs, Ohio.
