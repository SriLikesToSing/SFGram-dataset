T HIS IS the first issue of a new 

science fiction magazine called 
IF. The title was selected after 
much thought because of its brevity 
and on the theory it is indicative of 
the field and will be easy to remem- 
ber. The tentative title that just 
missed was BEYOND TOMOR- 
ROW, but when we woke up one 

morning and couldn’t remember it 
until we’d had a cup of coffee, it 
was summarily discarded. 

4 

A great deal of thought and ef- 
fort lias gone into the formation of 
this magazine. We have had the aid 
of several very talented and gen- 
erous people, for which we are most 
grateful. Much is due them for 
their warmhearted assistance. And 
now that the bulk of the formative 
work is done, we will try to main- 
tain IF as one of the finest books 
on the market. 

\ 

t 




a great public demand for our 
magazine. In short, why will you 
buy IF? 

We cannot, in honesty, say we 
will publish at all times the best 
science fiction in the field. That 
would not be true. But we will have 
access to the best stories, and we 
will get our fair share of works 
from the best writers. 

We definitely will not talk 



“adult” or “juvenile” relative to 
our content as we feel such terms 
are misleading. We would rather 
think at all times in the terms of 
“story”. Some of the greatest es- 
capist literature ever written, 
Treasure Island for instance, could 
be put into either category or both. 

And if Edgar Rice Burroughs is 
juvenile, then so are we, because 
the late master has given us some 
memorable thrills. 

Frankly, we don’t think you’ll 
buy IF because you feel we print 
better yams than any other mag. 
You will buy it, we hope, because 
you like its personality. Every 
magazine, we feel, does have a defi- 
nite personality of its own. This 
personality is usually a reflection of 
the editors, their way of thinking, 
their appreciation of tKe market, 
their interpretation of what you 
will like best in stories and art- 
work. 

We have tried to make IF differ- 
ent from any other science fiction 
magazine on the stands while still 
building it along the lines of what 
every science fiction mag must be. 
Aside from the letter columns and 
the editorial, which are depart- 
ments of field-wide use, we have 
not copied any feature of any other 
magazine. We will not, for in- 
stance, review fanzines, because we 
feel that is being most ably done 



by other mags. Nor will we, as a 
general practice, review books be- 
cause that appears to us to be over- 
done. 

I N SHORT, we’re trying to build 
a personality of our own and 
hope thereby to establish an affinity 
with a large number of readers who 
will remember IF when they buy a 
science fiction mag as one they like 
and wish to continue reading. 

At all times we will hew to the 
story-line and will exhort with our 
writers to do the same. As - an ex- 
ample, when Howard Browne 
phoned to talk over the plot for his 
lead novel in this issue, he de- 
scribed what ivas without doubt a 
staggering premise, a really star- 
tling concept. “But,” he mourned, 
S T suppose I’ll have to bend it 
around to give them the good old 
conventional ending.” 

We told Howard, “Not for IF, 
chum. Remember the old creed we 
live by. A writer may cheat on his 
wife, but he is ever true to the 
story-line. He may haul his infant 
son around by one leg. but he car- 
ries a good story-idea like a holy 
relic. If there is only one logical 
ending for Twelve Times ZerG, 
that’s the ending we want.” 
Therefore, we do not feel the 
majority of readers necessarily want 
a happy ending regardless of all 
else. Not when it is incompatable 
with the aura of realism created by 
the writer. 



A check-list of fiction master- 
pieces certainly bears this out. The 
furor created by a little piece called 
Sorry , Wrong Number would cer- 
tainly not have been forthcoming 
had the bedridden lady been res- 
cued in the last paragraph. Romeo 
and Juliet would have beep nothing 
more than the smooth effort of the 
world’s greatest writer if Romeo 
had gotten there in time. Yet, in 
modern fiction, he gets there in 
time with such amazing regularity 
one feels he has memorized at least * 
a dozen time-tables. The result has 
been unnumbered carloads of medi- 
ocre fiction. 

Also — though we don’t wish to 
underscore the point too heavily — 

what could more surely have 
smothered the greatness of Wuther- 
ing Heights than a happy ending? 

§ 

E DO NOT wish to indicate 
that IF will be a magazine giv- 
en over to tragedy. W e will only in- 
sist that our writers create scenes 
and climaxes that fix the story rath- 
er than cater to that old “debil” 
formula. 

And in so doing we have an en- 
tirely selfish motive. This: As the 
years go by, we want to look back 
with personal pride upon an ever- 
lengthening list of great stories. 

So the book you now hold in 
your hands is a new one titled IF. 
We hope you will like it— not for 
just a day — not for just a month. 
But for years to come. pwf

Police grilled him mercilessly 9 while 
eyes from a hundred worlds looked on * 




It was a love-triangle murder that made to- 
day’s headlines but the answer lay hundreds 
of thousands of light years away! 



HEY BROUGHT him into 
one of the basement rooms. 
He moved slowly and with 
a kind of painful dignity, as a man 
moves on his way to the firing 
squad. A rumpled shock of black 
hair pointed up the extreme pallor 
of a gaunt face, empty at the mo- 
ment of all expression. Harsh light 
from an overhead fixture winked 
back from tiny beads of perspira- 
tion dotting the waxen skin of his 
forehead. 



The three men with him 
watched him out of faces as ex- 
pressionless as his own. They were 

ordinary men who wore ordinary 
clothing in an ordinary way. yet in 
the way they moved and in the w r ay 
they stood you knew they were 1 
hard men who were in a hard and 
largely unpleasant business. - 
One of them motioned casually 
toward a straight-backed chair al- 
most exactly in the center of the 
room. “Sit there, Cordell / 1 he said.

HOWARD BROWN 



A quiet voice, not especially deep, 
yet its seemed to bounce off the 
painted concrete walls. 

Wordless, the young man obeyed. 
Sitting, he seemed as stiff and un- 
compromising as before. The man 
who had spoken made a vague 
gesture and the overhead light 
* went out, replaced simultaneously 
by strong rays from a spotlight 
aimed full at the eyes of the seated 
figure. Involuntarily the young 
man’s head turned aside to avoid 
the searing brilliance, but a hand 
came out of the wall of darkness 
and jerked it back again. 



4 ‘Just to remind you , 55 the quiet 
voice continued conversationally, 
“I’m Detective Lieutenant Kirk, 
Homicide Bureau . 55 A pair of hands 
thrust ‘a second chair toward the 
circle of light. Kirk swung it 
around and dropped onto the seat, 
resting his arms along the back, 
facing the man across a distance of 
hardly more than inches. 

In the pitiless glare of the spot- 
light CordelPs cheekbones * stood 
out sharply, and under his deepset 
eyes were dark smudges of exhaus- 
tion. His rigid posture, his blank 
expression, his silence — these 



HEN THE PLANS for IF 
were laid out, our first idea was 
to stage the scoop of the cen- 
tury: Get the lead novel from How- 
ard Browne, editor of AMAZING 
STORIES. No greater boost could 
be given an infant publication than 
Browne's name on the cover. We 
asked Howard and he asked bis boss, 
Mr. Davis, and Mr. Davis said, 
“Sure.” 

AMAZING STORIES is the 

oldest science-fiction publication in 
the world. It has the largest circu- 
lation in its field and up to January 
7 th (the day IF went on the 
stands), AMAZING was the best 
science fiction magazine your money 
could buy. It has the best writers in 
the field. Its departments are ex- 
cellent with Rog Phillips doing the 
fanzine reviews and Sam Merwin 
reviewing the books. So if you have 
a spare quarter, get a copy of 
AMAZING. You can't go wrong. 

And now, about Howard Browne. 
He is a huge man, made up almost 
entirely of vast enthusiasms. We 
have known Howard intimately for 
about six years and we continue to 



regard him with awe. There is no 
middle ground with this man. When 
he likes something, it’s terrific* If 
Howard hung a picture in his office 
we doubt if it would be a casual 
chore. The hammer he used would 
be a terrific hammer. The tack he 
drove would outshade other tacks by 
five country miles. And the picture? 
Gad, what a masterpiece! 

Seriously, one has only fo view 
Browne’s enthusiasm for living to 
know it for what it is — a priceless 
gift. He has written unnumbered 
short stories and, under the name 
of John Evans, is the father of 
Paul Pine, hero of the HALO series, 
the last of which was HALO IN 
BRASS, and the next of which will 
be HALO FOR HIRE out in the 

near future. We have watched him 
write several of his stories and he 
hurled himself into each with a zeal 
and a zest that sfunned us into a 
partial paralysis. 

So we give you Howard Browne, 
a hard fellow to classify ; an astound- 
ing mixture of Balzac, a ten-ton 
dynamo, and Peter Pan. But this 
above all— a great guy. 



TWELVE TIMES ZERO

seemed not so much indications of 
defiance as they did the result of 
some terrible and deepseated 
shock, 

"Let’s go over it again, Cordell,” 
Kirk said. 

The young man swallowed 
audibly against the silence. One of 
his hands twitched, came up al- 
most to his face as though to shield 
his- eyes, then dropped limply back. 
“That light — ” he mumbled. 

“—stays on , 55 Kirk said brisk- 
ly. 4 The quicker you tell us the an- 
swers, the quicker we all relax. 

Okay?” 

Cordell shook his head numbly, 
not so much in negation as an ef- 
fort to clear the fog from his tor- 
tured mind. T told you,” he cried 
hoarsely. “What rpofe do you 
want? Yesterday I told you the 
whole thing.” His voice began to 
border on hysteria. “What good’s 

my trying to tell you if you won’t 
listen? How’s a guy supposed — ” 
“Then try telling it straight!” 
Kirk snapped. “You think you’re 
fooling around with half-wits? 
Sure ; you told us. A crazy pack of 
goof-ball dreams about a blonde 
babe clubbing two grown people to 
death, then disappearing in a ball 
of blue light! You figure on cop- 
ping a plea on insanity?” 

“It’s the truth!” Cordell shouted. 
“As God hears me, it’s true!” Sud- 
denly he buried his face in his 
hands and long tearing sobs shook 

his slender frame. 

O ne of the other men reached 
out as though to drag the 
young man’s face back into the 



7 

withering rays of the spotlight, but 
Kirk motioned him away. Without 
haste the Lieutenant fished a cigar 
from the breast pocket of his coat 
and began almost leisurely to strip 
away its cellophane wrapper. A 
kitchen match burst into flame un- 
der the flick of a thumb nail and a 
cloud of blue tobacco smoke 
writhed into the cone of hot light. 

“Cordell,” Kirk said mildly. 

Slowly the young man’s shoul- 
ders stopped their shaking, and 
after a long moment his wan, tear- 
stained face came back into the 
light. “I — I’m sorry,” he mumbled. 

Kirk waved away the layer of 
smoke hanging between them. He 
said wearily, “Let’s try it once 

more. Step by step. Maybe this 
time . He let the sentence trail 
off, but the inference was clear. 

An expression of hopeless resig- 
nation settled over Cordell’s fea- 
tures. “Where do you want me to 
start?” 

“Take it from five o’clock the 
afternoon it happened.” 

The tortured man wet his lips. 
"Five o’clock was when my shift 
went off at the plant. The plant, in 
case you’ve forgotten, is the Ames 
Chemical Company, and I’m a 
foreman in the Dry Packaging de- 
partment.” 

“Save your sarcasm,” Kirk said 
equably. 

“Yeah. I changed clothes and 
punched out around five-fifteen. 
Juanita had called me about four 
and said to pick her up at Pro- 
fessor Gilmore’s laboratory,” 

44 At what time?” 

“No special time. Just when I

HOWARD BROWNE 



could get out there. We were go- 
ing to have dinner and take in a 
movie. iN’o particular picture; she 
said we'd pick one out of the pa- 
per at dinner ” 

“Go on . 55 

“Well, it must’ve been about 
quarter to six when I got out to 
the University. I parked in front of 
the laboratory wing and went in 
at the main entrance. I walked 
down the corridor to the Professors 
office. His typist was knocking out 
some letters and there were a cou- 
ple of students hanging around 
waiting for him to show up. How 
about a smoke, Lieutenant?” 

Kirk nodded to one of the men 
behind him and a package of ciga- 
rettes was extended to the man un- 
der the light. A match was prof- 
fered and the young man ignited 
the white tube, his hands shaking 
badly. 

The Lieutenant crossed his legs 
the other way. “Let’s hear the rest 
of it, friend.” 

“What for?” Bitterness tinged 
Cordell’s voice. “YoU don’t believe 
a word I’m saying.” 

“Up to now I do ” 

“Well. I said something or other 
to Alma — she’s the Profs secretary 
— and went on through the door 
to the hall that leads to the pri- 
vate lab. When I got — 55 

* 

K irk held up a hand. “Wait 
a minute. Your busting right 
in on the Professor like that doesn’t 
sound right. Why not wait in the 
office for your wife?” 

“What for?” Cordell squinted at 
him in surprise. “He and I get . , 



got along fine. When Juanita first 
went to work for him he said to 
drop in at the lab any time, not to 
wait in the outer office like a fresh- 
man or something.” 

“Go ahead.” 

“Well . The young man hesi- 
tated. “We’re back to the part you 
don't believe, Officer. I can’t hard- 
ly believe it myself ; but so help me, 
it’s gospel. I saw it!” 

“I’m waiting.” 

Cordell said doggedly: “The lab 
door was open a crack. I heard a 
woman’s voice in there, and . it 
wasn’t my wife’s. It was a voice 
like — like cracked ice. You know: 
cold and kind of . well . brittle 
and — and deadly. That’s the only 
way I can describe it. 

“Anyway, I *sort of hesitated 
there, outside the door. I didn’t 
want to go bulling in on something 
that wasn’t none of my business . 
but on the other hand I figured my 
wife was in there, else Alma 
would’ve said so.” 

“You hear anything besides this 
collection of ice cubes?” 

' The young man’s jaw hardened. 
“I’m giving it the way it happened. 
You want the rest, or you want to 
trade wise cracks?” 

One of the men behind Kirk 
lunged forward. “Why, you cheap 
punk — ” 

Kirk stopped him with an arm. 
“I’ll handle this, Miller.” To Cor- 
dell: “I asked you a question. An- 
swer it.” 

“I heard Professor Gilmore. 
Only a couple words, then two 
quick flashes of light lit up the 
frosted glass door panel. That’s 
when I heard these two thumps 




TWELVE TIMES ZERO 

like when somebody falls down. I 
shoved open the door fast . and 
right then I saw her!” 

Kirk nodded for no apparent 
reason and was careful about 
knocking a quarter inch of ash off 
his cigar. “Tell me about her.” 

The young man’s hands were 
shaking again. He sucked at his 
cigarette and let the smoke come 
out with his words : “She was clear 
over on the other side of the lab 
. standing a good two feet off the 
floor in the middle of a big blue 
ball of some kind of — of soft fire. 
Blue fire that sort of pulsed — you 
know. Anyway, there she was: this 
hell of a good-looking blonde ; look- 
ing right smack at me, and there 
was this funny kind of gun in her 
hand. She aimed it and I ducked 
just as this dim flash of light came 
out of it. Something hit me on the 
side of the head and I . well, I 
guess I blanked out.” 

“Then what?” 

“Well, like I said yesterday, I 
suppose I just naturally came out 
of it. I’m all spread out on the floor 
with the damndest headache you 
ever saw. Over by the window' is 
the Prof and — ” he wet his lips — 
“and Juanita. They’re dead. Lieu- 
tenant; just kind of all piled up 
over there . dead, their heads 
busted in and the — the — the — ” 



H e sat there, his mouth work- 
ing but no sound coming 
out, his eyes staring straight into 
the blazing light, the cigarette 
smouldering, forgotten, between 
the first two fingers of his left hand. 
Almost gently Kirk said: “Let’s 



go back to where you were stand- 
ing outside the door. You heard 
this woman talking. What did she 
say?” 

Cordell looked sightlessly dowm 
at his hands. “Nothing that made 
sense. Sounded, near as I can re- 
member, like: ‘Twelve times zero’ 
— then some words, or more num- 
bers maybe — I’m not sure — then 

# 

she said, ‘Chained to a two hundred 
thousand years’ — and the Professor 
said something about his colleges 
having no idea and he’d warn them 
—and the blonde said, ‘Three in 
the past five months’ — and then 
something about taking in wash- 
ing—” ' 

The detective named Miller gave 
a derisive grunt. “Of all the god- 
dam stories! Kirk, you gonna listen 
to any — ” 

Kirk silenced him with a gesture. 
“Go on, Cordell” 

The young man slowly lifted the 
cigarette to his mouth, dragged 
heavily on it, then let it fall to the 
floor. “That’s all. That’s when the 
lights started flashing in there and 
I tried to be a hero.” 

“Sure you’ve left nothing out?” 
“You’ve got it all. The truth, like 
you wanted.” 

Kirk said patiently, “Give it up, 
Cordell. You’re as sane as the next 
guy. Give that story to a jury and 
they’ll figure you’re trying to make 
saps out of them — and when a jury 
gets sore at a defendant, he gets 
the limit. And in case you didn’t 
know: in this State, the limit for 
murder is the hot seat!” 

The prisoner stared at him 
woodenly. “You know I didrPt kill 
my wife — or Professor Gilmore. I 




10 



had no reason to — no motive. 
There’s got to be a motive.* 

The police officer rubbed his 
chin reflectively. “Uh-hunh. Mo- 
tive. How long you married, Cor- 
dell?” 

“Six years.” 

“Children?” 

“No.” 

“Ames Chemical pay you a good 
salary ?” 

“Enough.” 

“Enough for two to live on?” 
“Sure” 

“How long did your wife work 
for Professor Gilmore?” 

“Four years next month.” 

“What was her job?” 

“His assistant.” 

“Pretty big job for a woman, 
wasn’t it?” 

“Juanita held two degrees in 
nuclear physics.” 

“You mean this atom bomb 
stuff?” 

“That was part of it.” 

“Gilmore’s a big name in that 
field, I understand.” Kirk said. 
“Maybe the biggest.” 

“Kind of young' to rate that 
high, wouldn’t you say? He 
couldn’t have been much past 
forty.” 

Cordell shrugged. “He was 
thirty-eight — and a genius. Genius 
has nothing to do with age, I hear.” 
“Not married, I understand.” 
“That’s right..” A slow frown 
was forming on Cordell’s face. 

“How old was your wife?” Kirk 
asked. 

The frown deepened but the 
young man answered promptly 
enough. “Juanita was my age. 
Twenty-nine.” 



HOWARD BROWNE 

Martin Kirk eyed his cigar cas- 
ually. “Why,” he said, “did you 
want her to walk out on her job; 
to give up her career?” 

Cordell stiffened. “Who says I 
did?” he snapped. 

“Are you denying it?” 

“You’re damn well right I’m 
denying it! What is this?” 

K irk was slowly shaking his 
head almost pityingly. “On at 
least two occasions friends of you 
and your wife have heard you say 
you wished she’d stay home where 
she belonged and cut out this ‘play- 
ing around with a mess of test 
tubes? Those are your own words, 
Cordell.” 

“Every guy,” the young man re- 
torted, “who’s got a working wife 
says something like that now and 
then. It’s only natural.” 

Kirk’s jaw hardened. “But every 
guy’s wife doesn’t get murdered.” 
The other looked at him unbe- 
lievingly. “Good God,” he burst 
out, “are you saying I killed Juan- 
ita because I wanted her to stop 
working? Of all the — ” 

“There’s, more!” snapped the 
Homicide man. “When you passed 
Professor Gilmore’s secretary in his 
outer office yesterday, what did you 
say to her?” 

“ ‘Say to her?’ ” 'the, prisoner 
echoed in a dazed way. “I don’t 
know that 1 . Some kidding re- 
mark, I guess. How do you expect 
me to remember a thing like that?” 
“I’ll tell you what you said,” 
Kirk said coldly. “It goes like this: 
‘Hi, Alma. You think the Prof’s 
through making love to my wife?’ ” 




TWELVE TIMES ZERO 



11 



Cordell’s head snapped back and 
h!s jaw dropped in utter amaze- 
ment. “What! Of all — ! You nuts ? 
I never said anything like that in 
my life! Who says I said that?” 

Without haste Kirk slid a hand 
into the inner pocket of his coat 
and brought out two folded sheets 
of paper which he opened and 
spread out on his knee. 

“Listen to this, friend,” he said 
softly. “ ‘My name is Miss Alma 
Dakin. I reside at 1142 Monroe 
Street, and arn employed as secre- 
tary to Professor Gregory Gilmore. 
At approximately 5 : 50 on the after- 
noon of October 19, Paul Cordell, 
husband of Mrs. Juanita Cordell, 
laboratory assistant to Professor 
Gilmore, passed my desk on his'way 
into the laboratory. I made no ef- 
fort to stop him, since my employer 
had previously instructed me to al- 
low Mr. Cordell to go directly to 
the laboratory at any time without 
being announced.’ ” Kirk looked 
up at the man in the chair opposite 
him. “Okay so far?” 
t Paul Cordell nodded numbly. 

“ ‘At the time stated above,’ ” 
Kirk continued, reading from the 
paper, “ ‘Mr. Cordell stopped brief- 
ly in front of my desk. He seemed 
very angry about something. He 
said, “Hi, Alma. You think the 
Prof’s through making love to my 
wife?” Before I could say anything, 
he turned away and walked into 
the corridor leading to the labora- 
tory. I continued my work until 
about five minutes later when Mr. 
Cordell came running back into the 
office and told me to call the po- 
lice, that Professor Gilmore and 
Mrs. Cordell had been murdered. 



“ ‘Since there is an automatic 
closer on the corridor door, I did 
not see Mr. Cordell enter the lab- 
oratory' itself. I do "know, however, 
that Professor Gilmore and Mrs. 
Cordell w r ere alone in the labora- 
tory less than ten minutes before 
Mr. Cordell arrived, as I had just 
left them alone there after taking 
some dictation from my employer. 
Since I went directly to my desk, 
and since there is no entrance to 
the laboratory other than through 
my office, I can state with certainty 
that Mr. Cordell was the only per- 
son to enter the laboratory between 
5:00 that afternoon and 5 : 55 when 
Mr. Cordell came out of the lab- 
oratory and told me of the murders. 

“ ‘I hereby depose that this is a 
true and honest statement, to the 
best of my knowledge, that it was 
given freely on my part, and that I 
have read it before affixing my sig- 
nature to its pages. Signed: Alma 
K. Dakin.’ ” 



T here was an almost omi- 
nous crackle to the document 
as Lieutenant Kirk folded it and 
returned it to his pocket. Paul 
Cordell appeared utterly stunned 
by what he had heard and his once 
stiffly squared shoulders were 
slumped like those of an old man. 

“I don’t have to tell you,” Kirk 
said, “that the only window in that 
laboratory is both permanently 
sealed and heavily barred. No one 
but you could have murdered those 
two people. You say you saw them 
killed by some kind of a gun. Yet 
a qualified physician states both 
deaths were caused by a terrific 




12 



blow from a blunt instrument We 
found a lot of tilings around the lab 
you could have used to do the job 
—-but nothing at all of anything 
like a projectile fired from a gum” 

The prisoner obviously wasn’t 
listening, “B — but she — she lied!” 
he stammered wildly. “All I said to

— three or four at the most — about 
not working too hard. Why should 
she put me on a spot like that? I

“Listen to me, Cordell,” Kirk 
cut in impatiently. “You knew, or 
thought you knew, your wife was 
having an affair with Professor 
Gilmore. You tried to break it up, 
to get her to leave her job. She 
wasn’t having any of that; and the 
more she refused, the sorer you got. 
Yesterday you walked in on them 
unannounced, found them in each 

other’s arms, and knocked them 

* 

both off in a jealous rage. When 
you cooled down enough to see 
what you’d done, you invented this 
wild yarn about a blonde in a ball 
of fire, hoping to get off on an in- 
sanity plea.” 

“I want a lawyer!” Cordell 
shouted. 

Kirk ignored the demand. 
“You’re going back to your cell for 
a couple hours, buster. Think this 
over. When you’re ready to tell it 
right, I want it in the form of a 
witnessed statement, on paper. If 
you do that, if you co-operate with 



HOWARD BROWNE 

the authorities, you can probably 
get off with a fairly light sentence, 
maybe even an outright acquittal, 
on the old ‘unwritten law’ plea. I 
don’t make any promises. Gilmore 
was a prominent man and a valu- 
able one; that might influence a 
jury against you. But it’s the only 
chance you've got— and I’m telling 
you, by God, to take, it!” 

Cordell was standing now, his 
face working. “Sure; I get it! All 
you’re after is a confession. What 
do you care if it’s a flock of lies? 
My wife wouldn’t even look at an- 
other man, and not you or any- 
body else is going to make me say 
different. That blonde killed them, 
I tell you — and I’ll tell a jury the 
same thing! They’ll believe me; 
they’re not a bunch of lousy fram- 
ing cops! You’ll find out who’s- — ” 
Lieutenant Martin Kirk wearily 
ground out his cigar against the 
chair rung. “All right, boys. Take 
him back upstairs.”

LL DRAWS DEATH NOD

. / 



, was today 
Criminal Court Justice 
P. Reed to death by electro- 
de morning of January 11, 
the murders of his wife, Juan- 
29, and her employer, world- 
famous nuclear scientist Gregory 
more. 

A jury last week found Cordell 
uilty of the brutal slayings de- 
spite his testimony that it was a 
mysterious blonde woman, floating 
in a “ball of blue fire,” who had 
blasted the victims with a “ray 
gun” on that October afternoon. 

Ignoring the “girl from Mars” 
angle, alienists for the prosecution 
pronounced the handsome defend- 
ant sane, and his attorneys were 
powerless to offset the damage. 

The final blow to Cordell's hopes 
for acquittal, however, was admin- 
istered by the State’s key witness, 
Alma Dakin, Gilmore’s former sec- 
retary. For more than three hours 
she underwent one of the most 
grilling cross-examinations in lo- 
cal courtroom ,

Kirk shoved the' paper aside. 
“What could he expect when he 
wouldn’t even listen to his own 
lawyers? They’ll appeal— they have

It was the patrolman 
outer office. “Woman out here

Asked for you personally. 

“What about?” 








“She won’t say. All I get is it’s 
important and she talks to you or 
nobody.” 

“What’s her name?” 

“No, sir. Not even that.. Want 
me to get rid of her?” 

Kirk eyed the mound of paper 
work on his desk and sighed. 
“Probably a taxpayer. All right; 
send her back here.” 

A moment later the patrolman 
loomed up outside the cubbyhole 
door, the woman in tow. Lieuten- 
ant Kirk remained seated, nodded 
briskly toward the empty chair 
alongside his desk. “Please sit 
down, madam. You wanted to see 
me?” 

“You are Mr. Kirk?” A warm 
voice, almost on the husky side, 
“Lieutenant Kirk.” 

“Of course. I am sorry.” . 




HILE SHE 

ful about 
Kirk stared 
was worth 
for a

voluptuous by exactly the right 
margin. Her face was more lovely 
than beautiful, chiefly because of 
large eyes so blue they were almost 
purple. Her skin was flawless, her 
blonde hair worn in a medium bob 
fluffed out, and her -smooth fitting 
tobacco brown suit must have been 
bought by appointment. She looked 
to he in her mid-twenties and was 
probably thirty. 

Her expression was solemn and 
her smile fleeting,, as was becoming 
to anyone calling on a Homicide 
Bureau. She placed on a corner of 
Kirk’s desk an alligator bag that 
matched her shoes and tucked p^le 
yellow gloves the color of her 
blouse under the bag’s strap. Her 
slim fingers, ringless, moved com- 
petently and without haste. 

a I am Naia North, Lieutenant 
Kirk.” 

“What’s on your mind, Miss 
North?” 

She regarded him gravely, see- 
ing gray-blue eyes that never quite 
lost their chill, a thin nose bent 
slightly to the left from an en- 
counter with a drunken longshore- 
man years before, the lean lines of 
a solid jaw, the dark hair that was 
beginning to thin out above the 
temples after thirty-five years. Even 
those who love him, she thought, 
must fear this man a little. 

Martin Kirk felt his cheeks flush 
under the frank appraisal of those 
purple eyes. “You asked for me by 
name, Miss North. Why?” 

“Aren’t you the officer who ar- 
rested the young man who today 
was sentenced to die?” 

Only years of practise at letting 
nothing openly surprise him kept 



HOWARD BROWNE 

Kirk’s jaw from dropping. .You 
mean Cordell?” 

“Yes.” 

“I’m the one. What about it? 
What’ve you got to do with Paul 
Cordell?” . 

Naia North said quietly, “A great 
deal, I’m afraid. You see, I’m the 
woman who doesn’t exist; the one 
the newspapers call ‘the girl from 
Mars.’” 

It was what he had expected 
fronuher first question about the 
case. Any murder hitting the head- 
lines brought at least one psycho 
out of the woodwork, driven by 
some deep-seated sense of guilt into 
making a phony confession. Those 
who were harmless were eased 
aside; the violent got detained for 
observation. 

But Naia North showed none of 
the signs of the twisted mind. She 
was coherent, attractive and ob- 
viously there was money some- 
where in her vicinity. While the last 
two items could have been true of 
a raving maniac, Kirk was human 
enough to be swayed by them. 

“I’m afraid,” he said, “you’ve 
come to the wrong man about this, 
Miss North.” His smile was frank 
and winning enough to startle her. 
“The case is out of my hands; has 
been since the District Attorney’s 
office took over. Why don’t you 
take it up with them?” 

H er short laugh was open- 
ly cynical. “I tried to, the day 
the trial ended. I got as far as a 
fourth assistant, who told me the 
case was closed, that new and con- 
clusive evidence would be neces-

Kirk picked up his cigar from 
the edge of the desk and tapped 
the ash onto the floor. “Shall I,” he 

said, his lips quirking, “ask you to 
write me a letter?” 

Naia North failed to respond to 
the light touch. “Pm through fill- 
ing wastebaskets,” she said flatly. 
“Either you do something about 
this or the newspapers get the en- 
tire story. Not that I’ll enjoy being 
a public spectacle, but at least 
they’ll give me some action.” 
“What do you want done?” 

She put both elbows on the desk 
and bent toward him. He 
caught the faint odor of bath salts 

from under the rounded 
s of her blouse. “That man

“Now,” Kirk said, “we’re

tary ?” • 

“Of course.” 

“Then .you know this Dakin 
woman was in the laboratory until 
a few minutes before Cordell 
showed up. You know that nobody 
could have gone into that labora- 
tory without her seeing them. You 
know that Alma Dakin testified 
that there were only two people in 
there: Gilmore and Juanita Cor- 
dell. So, Miss North, how did you 
get in there after Alma Dakin 
and before Paul Cordell arrived?” 
“But I didn’t.”

everybody would be out to lunch 
between twelve and one, so I went 
to the laboratory with the inten- 
tion of facing Greg there on his re- 
turn. When I heard him and Mrs. 

Cordell coming along the corridor, 
I sort of lost my nerve and hid in 
a coat closet.” 

Martin Kirk had completely 

dropped bis air of good-humored 
patience by this time. “You telling 
me you were hiding in there for al- 
most five hours without them 
knowing it?” 

Naia North shrugged her shoul- 
ders. “They had no reason to look 
in the closet. I'll admit I hadn’t in- 
tended to — to spy on Greg. But I 
kept waiting for him to say or do 
something that would prove or 
disprove he was in love with 
Juanita Cordell, and not until his 
secretary left and he was alone with 
her did I discover what was be- 
tween them. 1 must have come out 
of that dark hole like a tiger. Lieu- 
tenant. They jumped apart and v 
two people never looked guiltier. 
He said something particularly 
nasty to me and I grabbed up a 
short length of shiny metal from 
the workbench and hit him across 
the side of the head before lie knew 
what was happening. He fell down 
and the Cordell woman opened her 
mouth to scream and — and I hit 
her too.” 

She paused as though to permit 
Kirk to comment. “Go on.” he said 
hoarsely. 

“There’s not much left ” the girl 
said. “I was standing there still 
holding that piece of metal when 
the door crashed open and the dead 
woman’s husband ran in. He 



HOWARD BROWNE 

started to lunge across the. room 
at me and I threw the thing I was 
holding at hiim It struck him and 
he fell down. My only thought was 
to hide, for I realized I couldn’t go 
out through the outer office, and 
the only window was barred. So I 
hid in that closet again. 

“It was only- a few minutes be- 
fore Paul Cordell regained con- 
sciousness. He staggered out of the 
room and down the hall and I 
could hear a lot of excited talk and 
Greg’s secretary calling the police. 

Then I didn’t hear anything at all 
for a moment, so I came out of the 
closet and looked down the hall. 
The office door was closed, but it 
seemed so quiet in there that 1 tip- 
toed quickly to the inner door, 
opened it a crack and peered 
through. The office was deserted; 
evidently Cordell and Miss Dakin 
had gone out to direct the police 
when they showed up. 

“When I saw there was no one 
in the main hall of the building 
itself, I simply walked out and left 
by another exit. No one I passed 
even noticed me.” 



F or a long time after Naia 
North had finished speaking, 
Martin Kirk sat as though carved 
from stone, staring blindly into 
space. She knew he was thinking 
furiously, weighing the plausibility 
of what he had heard, trying to ar- 
rive at some method of corroborat- 
ing it in a way that would stand 
up in a court of law. 

“Miss North.” 

She came out of a reverie with a 
start, to find the Lieutenant’s eyes

boring Into hers. “This shiny hunk 
of metal you used : where is it 
now?”, 

“Fra sure I wouldn’t know. 
Probably some place in the labora- 
tory, unless somebody took it away. 
I do seem to remember picking it 
up and tossing it back with several 
others like it on the bench.” 

“Then it’s still there,” he said 
slowly. “Judge Reed ordered the 
room sealed up until after the trial. 
And then there’s the closet. , . 
Were you wearing gloves that after- 
noon, Miss North?” 

She said, “No. You’re thinking 
of fingerprints?” 

“If you’re telling the truth,” he 
said, “there’s almost certain to be 
some of your prints on the inside 
of that closet door — maybe even on 
that length of metal, if we can find 
it.” 

She said almost carelessly: 
“That’s all you’d need to clear Paul 
Cordell, isn’t it?” 

“It would certainly help.” He 
swung around in the chair, scooped 
up the telephone and gave a series 
of rapid-fire orders, then dropped 
the instrument on its cradle and 
turned back to where she sat watch- 
ing him curiously. 

He said, “A few things I still 
don’t get. Like this business of your 
standing two feet off the floor in a 
ball of blue light. And the flashes 
of light just before Cordell heard 
his wife and Gilmore fall to the 
floor. Even the snatches of conver- 
sation he caught while still in the 
hall. He couldn’t have dreamed all 
that stuff up— at least not with- 
out some basis.” 

She had opened her bag and 



taken out a cigarette. Kirk ignited 
one of his kitchen matches and she 

i 

bent her head for a light. He could 
see the flawless curve of one cheek 
and the smooth cap of blonde hair, 
and he resisted the urge to pass a 
hand lightly across both. Some- 
thing was stirring inside the Lieu- 
tenant — something that had long 
been absent. And, he reflected 
wryly, all because of a girl who had 
just finished confessing to two par- 
ticularly unpleasant murders. 

Naia North raised her head and 
their eyes met — met and held. Her 
lips parted slightly' as she caught 
the unmistakable message in those 
gray-blue depths. 

The moment passed, the spell 

was broken and she leaned back in 

% 

the chair and laughed a little shak- 
ily. “I read about those statements 
of his in the papers, Lieutenant. I 
think perhaps I can at least par- 
tially explain them. As I remember 
it, there were several Bunsen burn- 
ers lighted on the laboratory bench 
near that window'. They give off a 
blue flame, you know, and I must 
have been standing near them 
when Paul Cordell came charging 
in. In his confused frame of mind, 
he may have pictured me as being 
in a ball of flame.” 

“Sounds possible,” the man ad- 
mitted, frowning. “What about 
those flashes of light?” 

“You’ve got me there. Unless 
they were reflections of sunlight 
through the window — from the 
windshield of a passing car, per- 
haps.” 

“And the things he heard you 
and Gilmore saying?” 

She shook her head regretfully.

A male stenographer from Ms

dictated a complete statement 
which she signed. Troy questioned 
her for nearly two hours, getting in 
every possible angle of her private 
life as well as minute details of her

No, it was the girl. Naia North. 
Naia — a strange name. But no 
stranger than the girl herself. Now 
how about that? Why should he 
think her strange? Because she’d 
taken a life or two? Hell, lots of 
people did that and no one called 
them strange. Criminal or unmoral 
or greedy or angry, yes. But not 
strange. She looked like other wom- 
en — only a lot better. She dressed 
like them, walked like them, 
talked like them. So why strange? 

Because she was strange. Noth- 
ing you could put your finger on

He threw his cigar savagely into 
the fireplace. He went over and 
made another drink and poured it 
down fast and another one after it, 
right on its heels. Then he went to 
bed. Tomorrow — today, rather — 
was a work day and work days were 
tough days and he needed his rest. 

He didn't get much of it, though. 
The phone woke him a few minutes 
after seven o’clock. It was Arthur 
Kahler Troy at the other end and 
the IX A. was too angry to be co- 
herent. 

It seemed Naia North had dis- 
appeared from her locked cell dur- 
ing the night.

fifiT don’t give a triple-distilled

snarled. “Nobody’s got enough

off. Five men,. Lieutenant — five 
men and five locked doors stood be- 
tween that girl and the street. And 
you sit there and try to tell me 
somebody^bought all five of ’em 
off!” 

“Then,” Kirk said heatedly, 
“what’s your explanation?” 

It had been going on this way 
for over an hour. The morning sun 
came in weakly at the window be- 
hind Troy’s huge polished mahog- 
any desk, picking up random re- 
flections from the collection of ex- 
pensive gadgets littering the glass 
top. 

Troy began to wear another 
path in the moss-colored broad- 
loom carpeting. He was big and 
broad and getting puffy around the 
middle, like a one-time halfback 
going to seed. His round, heavy- 
featured face was even more .florid 
than usual, and his heavy growth 
of reddish-blond hair needed a 
comb. 

Martin Kirk pushed himself 
deeper into the depths of a brown 
leather chair and watched the 
D. A. through brooding eyes. He 
wanted a cigar but it was too early 
in the morning for that kind of in- 

You needed a

“I don’t explain it,” Troy said in 
quieter tones. He was standing by 
the window now, staring down in- 
to the boulevard passing that side of 
the Criminal Courts Building. “It’s 
one of those tilings that make me 
think my sainted mother wasn’t so

chauns and fairies and — 55 

Kirk made a sound deep in his 
throat, “Naia North was a hell of 
a long way from being a lepre- 
chaun. Somebody wanted her out 
of here for some reason — and they 
got her out. I want to know who 
took her out, why she was taken, 
and where she is now. And I’m go- 
ing to find out the answers to all 
three if I have to turn this town on 
its ear.” 

“Go ahead,” Troy said, “Hop 
right to it and I wish you luck. 
Only leave me and my people out 
of it.” 

“Seems to me you’re mighty 
damned anxious to be left out.” 

Arthur Kahler Troy turned on 
his heel and strode toward the 
Lieutenant until he was towering 
over him. “just what,” he said be- 
tween his teeth, “do you mean by 
that crack?” 

“Figure it out for yourself,” 
Kirk snapped. “And I’m sure you 
can.” 

Troy reared back as though the 
police officer had pulled a gun on 
him. “Why— why you — I’ll have 
you busted for making a dirty in- 
sinu — ” 

“You couldn’t bust a daisy chain 
at the police department,” Kirk 
growled. “The Commissioner hates 
your guts and you know that as 
well as I do. Now let’s cut out all 
this hokey-pokey and pick up a few 
loose ends. The first thing: what 
about Paul Cordell?” 

All the wide-eyed fury seemed to 
go out of Troy’s face like water 
down the bathtub drain. He turned 
away and walked slowly back to 
his desk chair and sat down. 



He said, “What about Cordell/’ 
in a soft voice. 

“The morning paper,” Kirk said, 
“reports he was taken up to Hill- 
crest last night. The warden out 
there’s probably got him in Death 
Row already.” 

“Uh-hunh.” 

“Well, let’s get him out of there. 
With the evidence we’ve got, plus 
Naia North's sworn statement, 
Judge Reed will have to bring him 
back down here and release him — 
at least on bail until we can find 
the girl. The man’s innocent, Mr. 
D. A.; have you forgotten?” 

“Yes.” 

“ ‘Yes’? Yes, what?” 

“I’ve forgotten he’s, innocent,” 
Troy said quietly. “Matter of fact, 
he’s guilty as hell” 

T he lieutenant half rose from 
his chair. “Now wait a min-

and you’ve got the evidence I 
turned over to you right here in

“I’ll tell you what more/’ Troy

does that poor devil up in Death’s 
Row. 

He drummed his fingers over and 
over on the arm of his chair and 
listened to the every-day sounds of 
a normal day at the Homicide Bu- 
reau. A new day, a new set of prob- 
lems, and why knock yourself out 
over some tiling that doesn’t con- 
cern you? Thing to do was go down 
to the comer tavern and have a 
couple of fast ones and watch an 
old movie on television. Yes sir, 
that’s exactly what he’d do! 

He went back to the mimeo- 
graphed pages. 

For the fourth time he read 
through Cordell’s testimony of 
what had happened that October 
afternoon. And it was there that 
he came across the first possible 
break in the stone wall. 

Once more Martin Kirk went 
over the few lines, although by this 
time he could have come close to 
reciting them from memory. It was 
an excerpt from Arthur Kahler 
Troy’s cross-examination of the de- 
fendant after Cordell’s counsel, in a 
last desperate effort to swing the 
tide of a losing battle, had placed 
him on the stand. 

Q: (by Troy) : Now, Mr. 

Cordell, I direct your at- 
tention to the point in 
your testimony at which 
first entered Professor Gil- 
more’s outer office. At 
what time was this? 

A: At about 5:45 p.m. 

Q: Who was in the office at 
that time? 



A: Alma Dakin, the Profes- 
sor’s secretary. And a cou- 
ple of students — although 
, they were at the other end 
of the room and I didn’t 
pay much attention to 
them . 

Q: But you did pay atten- 
tion, as you call it, to Miss 

Dakin? 

A: Well, I spoke to her, if 
that’s what you mean. 

Q: That’s exactly what I 
mean, Mr. Cordell. And 
what was it you said to 
her? 

A: Something about it was 

- too late in the day to be 

- working so hard. 

Q: That was all? 

A: Yes, sir. 

Q: Remember, Mr. Cordell, 
you’re under oath. Now I 
ask you again : Was that 
all you said to her at that 
time? 

A: Yes, sir. 

Q: It isn’t possible you’ve for- 
gotten some additional re- 
mark? Think carefully, 
please. 

A: No, sir. That’s all I said. I 
swear it. 

Q: Very well. Now how well 
do you know Miss Dakin? 




TWELVE TIMES ZERO 

A: Just to speak to, 

Q: Have you ever seen her 
outside Professor Gil- 
more’s office? 

A: No, sir. 

Q: Ever ask her for a date? 

A: 'No, sir. 

Q: Did you ever have an 
argument with her? A dis- 
cussion of any kind that 
may have become a bit 
heated? 

A: No, sir. 

Q: Then to your knowledge 
she’d have no reason to 
dislike you? 

A: No, sir. 

Q: Very good. Now, Mr. Cor- 
dell, I want to read to you 
an excerpt from the testi- 
mony given by Miss Dakin 
in this court. “Mr. Cor- 
dell was looking very an- 
gry when he came in. He 
came up to me and bent 
down over the desk and 
said so low I could hard- 
ly hear him: ‘Hi, Alma. 
You think the ProPs 
through making love to 
my wife?’ ” I now ask you, 
Paul Cordell, isn’t that 
what you said to Alma 
Dakin? Not that she -was 
working too hard, or 
whatever it was you 



claimed to have said. 

A: No, sir. I didn’t say any- 
thing like she said I did. I 
wouldn’t insult my wife 
by saying such a thing to 
a third — 

Q: Just answer the questions, 
Mr. Cordell. Then you 
contend that Miss Dakin 
deliberately lied in her 
testimony. 

A: She was mistaken. 

Q: Oh, come now! Miss 
Dakin is an intelligent 
girl; she couldn’t misun- 
derstand or twist your 
words to that extent. Now 
could she? 

A: Then she lied. I never said 
anything like that. 

Q: What reason would she 
have for lying, Mr. Cor- 
dell? By your own state- 
ment she hardly knew 
you, always greeted you 
pleasantly on the times 
you came to the office, 
never got into any argu- 
ments with you, and never 
saw you outside the office. 
She had worked for Pro- 
fessor Gilmore for five or 
six months, has excellent 
references, and is well 
liked by her friends. Yet 
you’re asking us to believe 
that she coldly and delib- 
erately lied to get you into 
trouble. Is that true?

to Alma Dakin,

testimony was untrue. 

Kirk ran his fingers through his 
in a gesture of bafflement. 
What possible reason could Gil- 
more’s secretary have for going out 
of her way to lie about Cordell’s 
remark? Was it because she was so 
certain he had killed her employer 
that she wanted to make sure he 
would be punished? 

Or was it because she wanted to 
shield the real killer? Maybe she 
was a friend of Naia North’s and 
had known the blonde girl was in 
Gilmore’s laboratory all along. She 
might even have deliberately 
steered everyone out of her office 
after Cordell discovered the bodies, 
making it possible for Naia to slip 
out unseen.

When Miss Slife had run down, 
Kirk said, “This Dr. Karney. Why

The woman' at the other end of 
the wire seemed astonished by 
Kirk’s ignorance. “Why, 1 as-

anything like that. He needed 
more evidence-evidence not to be 
explained away as coincidence.

ference to the man in the street, 
but to the Professor . Wait a 
minute! Not colleges! Colleagues! 
It was his colleagues Gilmore had 
promised to warn. And the word 
meant men and women in the same 
line of work as the Professor — 
nuclear physics. Things, Kirk told 
himself with elation, were looking 
up! 

The business about “three in the 
past five months” was next, but he 
felt sure of what that had meant. 
But the last of the quotations w&nt 
nowhere at all. 

“Something about taking in 
washing — ” Under less tragic cir- 
cumstances, a nonsense line. But 
Cordell hadn’t actually heard the 
words clearly enough to quote 
them with authority. That could 
mean he had heard words that 



problem,” Kirk explained careless- 
ly. “Let’s say you hear a guy talk- 
ing in the next room. You can’t 
really make out the words he’s say- 
ing, but right in the middle of his 
mumbling you hear what sounds 
like ‘taking in washing.’ Now you 
know that can’t be right, so you 
try to think out what he actually 
did say . 

It was obvious Chenowich had 
fallen off on the first curve, so com- 
pletely off that Kirk didn’t bother 
finishing what was much too in- 
volved to begin with. The patrol- 
man was staring at him in mon- 
strous perplexity. 

“Jeez. Lieutenant. I don’t get it. 
’Less the guy’s goin’ to open up one 
of these here laundries. That way 
he’d be takin’ in washinh But I 
don’t know what else — ” 



sounded like “taking in washing.” 
Taking, baking, making, slaking, 
raking — the list seemed endless. 
“Washing” could have been the 
first two syllables of Washington — 
and Washington would be the 
place where the Atomic Energy 
Commission hung out. 

Still too hazy. He leaned back 
and put his feet up and attacked 
the three mysterious words from 
every conceivable angle. No dice. 

S ight of the ambling figure 
of Patrolman Chenowich pass- 
ing the office door caught his eye, 
reminding him that two heads were 
often better than one. “Hey, 
Frank.” 

Chenowich came in. “Yeah, 



Kirk’s feet hit the floor with a 
solid thump and he grabbed 
Chenowich’s wrist with fingers 
that bit in like steel. “Say that 
again!” he shouted. “Say it just 
that way!” 

The patrolman recoiled in 
alarm. “What’s got into you, Lieu- 
tenant? Say what?” 

“Taking in washing!” 

“Takin’ in washin’? What for?” 
Kirk’s grin threatened to split his 
face. “The same words,” he said, 
“but you say them different. Only 
. your way’s the right way! Thanks, 
pal. Now get out of here!” 

Chenowich went. His mouth was 
still open and his expression still 
troubled, but he went. 

The last of the killer’s cryptic re- 
marks was now clear. For Kirk re-

“taking." “Bacon”, for instance — 
or “Dakin” S Alma Dakin, former 
secretary to two widely separated, 
and now dead, nuclear scientists. 
Her name had been mentioned by 
the slayer of Professor Gilmore 
only seconds before she had 
clubbed the savant to death. 

But now that “taking” had 
come out “Dakin” — what did the 
rest of the phrase mean? Dakin in 
washing made no sense. What 
sounded like washing? Washing; 
washing . watching? It was close; 
in fact nothing he could think of 
came closer. 

right Dakin in watching ; no. 
Dakin is watching — that made 
sense. But Alma Dakin hadn’t been 
watching anything at the time of 
the killing; she, according to Cor- 
dell, was at her desk in the outer 
office. That would leave Dakin was 
watching as the right combination. 
Watching for the right opportunity 
for murder 1 / 

What did it mean? Well, assum- 
ing from her past record that Alma 
Dakin was mixed up in the deaths 
of two prominent men of science, 
it argued that she and Naia North 
were accomplices in a scheme to 
rid America of her nuclear fission 
experts. The nice smooth story of 
killing Gilmore because of unre- 
quited love was probably as much 
a lie as the personal information 
Naia North had given Arthur 
Kahler Troy. 

The North girl had confessed to 
murdering Gilmore and Juanita 
Cordell. As a confessed killer she 
must be taken into custody and 
booked on suspicion of homicide. 
Taking her was Martin Kirk's job 



— and it seemed he had a contact 
that would lead him to her. Name- 
ly Alma Dakin. 

Lieutenant Kirk grabbed his hat 
and went out the door. 



Chapter V 

T he address for Alma Dakin 
turned out to be a small three- 
story walk-up apartment building 
on a quiet residential street near 
the outskirts of town. At two in the 
afternoon hardly anyone was visible 
on the sidewalks and only an oc- 
casional automobile passed. 

Kirk parked his car half a block 
further on down and got out into 
the chill November air. He entered 
the building foyer and looked at the 
name plates above the twin rows of 
buttons. The one for Alma Dakin 
told him the number of her apart- 
ment was 3C. 

He pushed the button several 
times but without response. The 
foyer was very quiet at this time 
of day, and he could hear the faint 
rasp of her bell through the speak- 
ing tube. 

Kirk was on the point of shift- 
ing his thumb to the button marked 

superintendent when a sudden 

% 

thought stayed his hand. It was not 
the kind of thought a conscientious, 
rule-abiding police officer would 
harbor for a moment. The lieuten- 
ant, however, was fully aware he 
had no business working on a 
closed case to begin with — and

rules, you might as well break

Okay. Sorry we bothered you, 
Kirk' let the door swing into 
place hard enough to be heard up- 
stairs. But this 'time he was on the 
right side of it. 

There was a moment of silence, 
then he caught the sound of re- 
treating feet and a door closed. 
Without waiting further, the Lieu- 
tenant mounted the stairs to the 
third floor, his feet soundless on 
the carpeted treads. 

The entrance to 3G was secured 
by a tumbler-type lock. From an 
inner pocket Kirk took out a small 
flat leather case and a thin-edged 
tool from that. Working with the

found nothing, no one, not even 
the girl who lived here, could tell 
that an intruder had been at work. 

The bedroom seemed even less 
promising at first. Dresser drawers 
gave up only the pleasantly per- 
sonal articles of the average young 
woman. Miss Dakin, it turned out, 
was almost indecently fond of 
frothy undergarments and black 
transparent nightgowns — interest- 
ing but not at all important to the 
over-all problem. 

Kirk, his search completed, sat 
down on the edge of the bed’s 
footboard and totaled up what he 
had learned. It didn’t take long,

his already strong suspicion of 
her was solidified into certainty 
of her guilt. But certainty was a 
long way from rock-ribbed evi- 
dence— and that was something he 
must have to proceed further. 

He was ready to leave when it 
dawned on him that he had not 
yet looked under the bed. Kneel- 
ing, he pushed up the hanging 
edge of the green batik spread and 
peered into the narrow space. 
Nothing, not even a decent accu- 
mulation of dust. The light from 
the window was too faint, however, 
to reach a section of the floor near 
the footboard. Kirk climbed to his 
feet and attempted to shove that 
end to one side. • 

The bed failed to move. He 
blinked in mild surprise and tried 
again. It was only by exerting, al- 
most his entire strength that he was 
able to shift the thing at all, and 
then no more than a few inches. 

He felt his pulse stir with the 
thrill of incipient discovery. Once 
he made sure nothing was anchor- 
ing the bed to the floor, he began 
to tap lightly against the wood in 
an effort to detect a possible false 
panel. 

Within two minutes he located 
an almost microscopic crack in the 
headboard cleverly concealed by a 
decorative design running along 
the base. He ran his fingers lightly 
i along the carvings until they en- 
countered a small projection which 
gave slightly under pressure. 

Kirk pressed down harder on the 
knob. A tiny click sounded against 
the silence and a section of wopd 
some three feet square swung out. 
Lifting it aside, the detective found 



himself staring at an instrument 
board of some kind with a series 
of buttons and dials countersunk 
into it. The board itself formed a 
part of what was obviously a ma- 
chine of some sort which evidently 
contained its own power, for there 
seemed to be no lead-in cord for 
plugging into a wall socket. 

It could, Kirk thought, be a 
short wave radio transmitter. If it 
was, it looked like none he had ever 
, come across before. On the other 
hand it could be some sort of in- 
fernal machine, ready to blow half 
the city to bits at the turn of a dial. 

E ven as his mind was weighing 
the advisability of tampering 
with the thing, his fingers were 
reaching for the various controls. 
Gingerly he moved one or two of 
the dials but nothing happened. A 
little more boldly now, he began to 
depress the buttons. As the third 
sank in, a low humming sound be- 
gan to fill the room. Before Kirk 
could find a cut-off switch of some 
kind, the faint light of day stream- 
ing through the room’s one win- 
dow winked out, plunging him into 
a blackness so infinitely deep that 
it was like being buried alive. 

Nothing can plunge a man into 
the sheerest panic like the absence 
of light. Even a man like Martin 
Kirk, who had walked almost daily 
with danger for the past fifteen ' 
years. And since the form panic 
takes varies with the individual, 
the Lieutenant’s reaction was an 
utter inability to move so much as 
a finger. 

Abruptly the low humming note

The word ended as though it 
had run into a wall. The humming 
note came back, then ceased— and 
without warning daylight from the 
window washed over the bewil- 
dered and thoroughly frightened 
police officer. 

Not until five minutes had passed 
was Martin Kirk sufficiently in 
control of his nervous system to 
even attempt replacing the loose 
panel in the headboard. When at 
last he managed to do so, he re- 
turned the bed to its original posi- 
tion, closed and bolted the kitchen

The next step was the dangerous 
one. The superintendent admitted 
Kirk to the Dakin apartment and 
went down to the. foyer to ring the 
bell in case the girl arrived at the 
wrong time. He soothed the Lieu- 
tenant’s anxiety somewhat by ex- 
plaining that she seldom returned 
the place before seven o’clock, 
over three hours from now, but 
Kirk was taking no chances.

t was like being in her room 
with his eyes shut. The soft 
scraping of drawers opening and 
closing, the creak of a chair be- 
ing sat in, the cushioned thump of 
shoes dropped to the carpeted floor, 
even the rustle of a nylon slip as 
she drew it over her head. 

It seemed much too early for her 
to turn in for the night. Was he 
going to be forced to sit there and 
listen to twelve or fourteen hours 
of feminine snoring? It would be 
damned unlikely in view of what 
was a cinch to be running through 
her mind, f 

Minutes later he heard her leave 
the bedroom, followed 
the muted roar of a 
shower. After that had laste

If there was anything of a pan- 
icky nature in her movements it 
would take better ears than his to 
detect it. But for Alma Dakin to 
get away with her kind of job re- 
quired the nerves of lion trainer no 
matter what pressures she was sub- 
jected to. 

Kirk stretched his legs, dug a 
cigar from the breast pocket of his 
coat and got it burning, then went 
back to the crossword puzzle 
with half his attention, keeping 
alert for any significant sound 
from the other apartment. His years 
as a minion of the law had ade- 
quately conditioned him to the ut- 
ter boredom that went with the 
ordinary stake-out. 

Several times the subject left the 
bedroom, but he was able to pick 
up sounds familiar enough to trace 
as emanating from the living room 
or kitchen. But nothing she did was 
worthy of notice in the home-town 
paper or even on the margin of a 
police blotter. 

A t 9:24 Alma Dakin again 

entered the bedroom. A 
hunch, or a sixth sense, or what- 
ever years of experience in a single 
field gives a man, told Kirk that 
this time something would pop. He 
put aside the newspaper, placed a 
sheet of blank paper on the cover 
of a historical romance lifted from 
the spinster’s nightstand, and got 
out a pencil, 

A motor whined unexpectedly 
from the opposite side of the apart- 
ment wall and he could hear a 
heavy object roll with well-oiled 
smoothness a short distance across 



HOWARD BROWNE 

the carpet. He decided it was the 
bed being moved out from the wall 
by mechanical means rather than 
muscle, and it was clear to him 
now how she was able to get at that 
hidden radio, or whatever it was. 

For the second time that day 
Kirk heard that eerie humming — 
a sound, he realized, that ordinarily 
would have been completely in- 
audible beyond the girl’s bedroom 
walls. Suddenly the hum was 
chopped off and a familiar voice 
spoke familiar words. 1 

“Mythox. Contact established. 
Proceed.” 

“A message for Orin. Alma 
Dakin” 

A series of almost undetectable 
clicking sounds; then: 

“Alma?” Despite the fact that 
the voice was coming through an 
amplifier, there was no distortion. 
•“Anything wrong?” 

It was a man’s voice, clear, vi- 
brant, young, and with no trace 
of an alien accent. Kirk’s theory' of 
an interplanetary’ menace lost some 
of its strength. 

“I — I’m not sure, Orin,” the girl 
said hesitantly. “There was a po- 
liceman at my apartment today — 
the same one Naia went to; The 
building superintendent told me,” 

“That’s odd. There’s no way you 
can be tied in with her. Or is 
there ?” 

“Not that I know of, Orin. Un- 
less they’ve decided to check back 
on me just for the sake of some-, 
thing to do. If that’s what’s hap- 
pened and they’ve learned I was 
working for Dr. Karney at the time 
of his death, they may get an idea 
the three deaths are related. And 




35 



TWELVE TIMES ZERO 

once a police officer gets suspicious, 
he can hound you unmercifully. 
That’s what worries me, Orin. You 
know Fm not really an accom- 
plished liar!” . 1 

“Shall we bring you here? At 
least long enough to build you a 
new identity?” 

A pause. Then the girl’s voice 
again: “Something else puzzles me, 
too. There’s no mention of Naia’s 
confession in the newspapers.” 
“What? You mean they haven’t 
released Cordell? What will Tamu 
say?” 

“If they have, nobody knows 
about it. I told you Naia should 
have remained in their hands until 
the young man was set free. You 
don’t know my people as I do. Orin 
— none of you do.” 

“But the evidence? Nobody, not 
even the most stupid of Earthmen, 
could have ignored that evidence! 
Tamu won’t like this.” 

“I can’t help it, Orin. I keep 
telling you, Orin: you must use a 
new set of standards for this world. 
If its people thought as yours do, 
none of these unpleasant things 

would have to happen.” 

> 

A nother pause before the 
man’s voice came over Kirk’s 
earphones. “We didn’t dare leave 
Naia in their hands. That’s why 
we brought her back here. Look at 
the chance we took by permitting 
them to hold her even briefly. If 
only she hadn’t blundered in the 
first place . ” 

His voice trailed off, then came 
back suddenly brisk. “Well, too late 
for regrets. We won’t risk letting 



them question you. Field Seven in, 
say, three hours. Time enough?” 
“More than enough!” Her relief 
was unmistakable. “It’ll be wonder- 
ful visiting Mythox again, Orin. I 
hope Methu will allow me to stay 

for a long time.” t 

“I hope so too, darling. But our 
work comes first; none of us dares 
let down for even a moment. 
See you soon. And don’t neglect 
to eliminate the contrabeam.” 

“It will be gone seconds after we 
break contact. Field Seven at — 
let’s see— 12:30.” 

“I’ll be there. Farewell, Alma.” 
The dim humming came back 
again, followed briefly by no sound 
at allf Then there was the noise of 
drawers being opened and closed 
with a kind of brisk and cheerful 
haste. Alma Dakin was preparing 
to take it on the lam! , 

Martin Kirk knew he had only 
a limited time to plan his own 
course of action. One way was to 
walk into the adjoining apartment, 
place Alma Dakin under arrest and 
force the whole story from her. A 
moment’s reflection, however, 
caused him to abandon the idea. 
Any such move would end his 
chances of getting his hands on 
Naia North. More than anything 
else he wanted her, and he closed 
his mind to the broader aspects of 
what had taken — and was still tak- 
ing — place. 

No, his job was to follow Alma 
Dakin to her rendezvous with this 
man Orin and in some way force 
the two of them into turning Naia 
North over to him. This time she’d 
stick around long enough to stand 
trial— even if he had to handcuff 





her to the bars of her cell ! 

From beyond the wall he .caught 
the sounds of suitcases being 
snapped shut, followed by the fad- 
ing echo of footsteps. He jerked 
the earphones from his head and 
went quickly to the hall door in 
time to catch a glimpse of Alma 
Dakin on her way to the building 
stairs, a bulging suitcase in each 
hand. 

Kirk raced for the kitchen of 3D, 
flung open the door and went down 
the rear steps with astonishing agil- 
ity. He was opening the door of 
his car by the time the girl came 
out of the front entrance. He 
watched her place the bags in the 
trunk of a small sand-colored 
coupe, then slip in behind its wheel 
and start the motor. 

The coupe passed his parked car, 
turned the corner and disappeared. 
Before it had reached the next in- 
tersection, Kirk was rolling smooth- 
ly half a block to her rear. 

Two hours later both cars were 
moving along a winding country 
road miles from civilization. Kirk 
was driving without lights, bad 
enough under favorable circum- 
stances but sheer folly considering 
the sky was completely overcast, so 
that he was denied even the faint 
radiance of the stars. Fortunately 
there was no other traffic in this 
desolate section at eleven o’clock 
at night, so that his only danger 
was in failing to remain on the 
twisting road. 



in ally, , near the crest of a 
particularly steep hill, two 
flaring red lights warned him his 




HOWARD BROWNE 

quarry was applying the brakes of 
her car. He cut ins engine long 
enough to hear the coupe’s motor 
die, then he swung his wheel to 
the right and coasted to a halt on 
the soft shoulder of the road. 

Under cover of bushes and trees, 
naked of foliage at this time of the 
year, Kirk worked his way silently 
ahead until' he could make out the 
dim figure of the girl as she 
dragged the pair of bags from the 
boot. Without a backward glance, 
she turned away from the road and 
an instant later was lost to sight 
among the trees. 

There was nothing of the fron- 
tiersman in Lieutenant Martin 
Kirk, but fortunately the same was 
true of Alma Dakin. Where any- 

one accustomed to moving across 
natural terrain could have lost the 
officer with ease, in her case he 
need only pause briefly from time 
to time and use his ears. 

At last the seemingly intermi- 
nable forest ended and the girl sank 
wearily down on an upended suit- 
case. Kirk, perspiring freely under 
the folds of his topcoat, halted in 
the shelter of a' tree bole, and 
waited. 

Beyond where the girl sat was a 
large natural clearing covered with 
a fringe of winter grass. The silence 
was close to being absolute; only 
the faint keening of a chill wind 
and the restless creak of barren 
branches kept it from becoming un- 
bearable. 

Gradually his eyes became more 
and more accustomed to the ab- 
sence of light worthy of the name, 
and he began to identify objects as 
something more than formless

Before the Lieutenant could get 
his jaw off his necktie, Alma Dakin 
had uttered a cry of relief and was 
racing toward the nearest edge of 
the gleaming vessel. A panel in its 
side slid noiselessly back and the 
tall figure of a man was outlined 
in the opening. 

“Alma!” he shouted and sprang 
to the ground to meet her. 

They came together almost vio- 
lently midway between the clear- 
ing’s edge and the ship. She clung 
to him as he bent his head to meet 
her lips. 

Kirk glanced past them at the 
open portal. Dim light from within 
cast a soft glow against the night. 
Nothing moved in the narrow seg- 
ment of the interior visible from 
where he was standing. 

And Kirk had a moment of what 
was as close to fear as he was able 
to know. A little time of bewilder- 
ment when his guard slipped just 
a trifle. What in the hell was all 
this? Into his solid world had come 
strange and unreasonable things. 
Crazy ships, and people who didn’t 
play according to the rules he had 
learned over thankless drudging 
years as an honest cop. A few tiny 
beads of sweat formed on his upper 
lip. 

Then Ms stubborn, inherent fa- 
talism came to his aid. He grinned 
without humor. The hell with it. 
Whatever came up — a screwball 
flying saucer or a berserk psycho 
waving a gun. You played it the 
same; according to your own rules. 
This thing, whatever it was, 
bridged the gap to a killer. And 
when you found such a bridge, you 
crossed it. 



HOWARD BROWNE 

M .^rtin kirk, his gun clutched 

tightly, moved -like a casual 
shadow, eased his way along the 
hull of ship and slipped inside. 

He had never seen anything like 
this. The lighting for one thing. It 

came from nowhere and somehow 
the stuff had a mood. It seemed 
alive — an intelligent force watch- 
ing him, mocking him, sneering at 
him. And so potent was the mood 
of the whole setup, so sharp his 
need of release that he muttered, 
“The hell with you,” and softly fol- 
lowed a circular corridor which 
curved off the hull. 

They were coming toward the 
ship, Orin and Alma — coming 
while he still hunted a hole. He 
kept on going. If he met anybody 
they were going ta>go down. But 
he didn’t. He found a steel stair- 
way and a pocket at its base to hold 
his body. It wasn’t a dark pocket. 
Light was everywhere. But the 
stairway hid him and the pair 
passed by and went on down the 
corridor. 

He realized his right hand was 
aching and relaxed his grip on the 
gun butt he clutched. He straight- 
ened up and the tense little mirth- 
less grin played on his lips. 

Okay. Now where was she and 
how- did it work? Could he find her 
and haul her off silly tilt-a- whirl? 
He thought not. Either his eyes 
were bad or this thing had ap- 
peared from nowhere. Something 
inside snapped: Quit thinking that 
way! Whatever it looked like — 
think right. Follow the rules. Look 
for the dame. His grin deepened. 
Sure. 

He started walking. Around the 




TWELVE TIMES ZERO 




eerie corridor in the direction op- 
posite that taken by Orin and 
Alma Dakin. He walked a long 
time and there were no doors or 
anything else so the only thing to 
do was keep walking. He thought: 
When I come to that stairway I’ll 
be back where I started but 
where’s that? What good is a hall 
you keep going around and around 
in? 

The ship lurched and threw him 
to the floor. It was going some- 
where. 

But it didn’t go anywhere. Of 
that he was sure. Maybe he’d been 
fooled but it seemed the ship set- 
tled back after that single lurch and 
lay there like a choice segment 
out of someone’s pet nightmare. 
Kirk got to his feet and rubbed the 
place his leg had violently met the 
floor. 

He walked on and there was the 
steel stairway again and it was all 
very damned silly because he knew 
he’d circled the 
times. 

But lucky because the footsteps 
sounded again and as he dived to- 
ward the pocket, the wall of the 
ship opened to form a doorway. 
They forgot something, he thought. 
What kind of supermen are these? 
They can build a ship that has a 
stairway every third trip around 
and still they go away and forget 
things, „ 

The grin ’was tighter than ever. 
Whistle in the dark, boy, but admit 
it — you’re scared. Sure, but what’s 
that got to do with it? . 

Orin and Alma left the ship. 
Martin Kirk pushed his head 
around the staircase. He crouched 



ship at least three 

* 



for sometime, staring through the 
open segment of the hull at the out- 
side world. And his poor stupid 
orthodox mind asked a pitifully 
logical question: 

How could it get light, with the 
sun at high noon, in fifteen min- 
utes? 

After a long, motionless time, the 
silence became such a roaring 
thing in Kirk’s ears he could stand 
it no longer. He got up and walked 
to the doorway. 

Something had gone somewhere; 
either the ship or the world he’d 
known, because out there was a dif- 
ferent world and he knew damn 
well he’d never seen it before. 



Chapter VII 



M artin kirk stepped out into 

a circle of lush vegetation. 
And in doing so, he learned some- 
thing. He learned that the human 
*mind is a far more adaptable 
mechanism than most people im- 
agine; that they can pelt you with 
goof balls and you get sweat on 
your iip and have to talk to your- 
self to keep from sliding off your 
rocker, but after a while when 
your mind seems halfway over the 
edge, it straightens up suddenly and 
starts going along. A defense 
mechanism against insanity? He 

didn’t know. 

He only knew that when the 
tiger roared, he whirled around 
with his gun leveled, saw the six- 
inch teeth, got wholesomely and 
sanely scared, and then everything 




40 

was all right. He knew he was all 
right when he got the right reac- 
tion from sight of the almost naked 
girl holding the tiger. 

For a long moment it was a 
frozen-action tableau. The huge 
orange and black beast. The wide 
eyed young brunette nudist, and 
the tropical forest with the great 
big fart sun overhead. The girl’s 
voice nailed it all down. “Don’t be 
afraid. Rondo won’t hurt you.” 
Kirk’s resentment flared warmly 
and, had resentment been a tangi- 
ble thing, he would have kissed it. 
“You’re tootin’ right he won’t, sis- 
ter. This isn’t a toy Fm holding.” 
“Rondo is very gentle.” 

Kirk eyed the girl. “Why don’t 
you put some clothes on?” 

Her teeth were as bright and 
even as little white knives but her 
smile took the edge off them. “Only 
people in the city wear clothes. I 
wear them when I’m in the city. 
When I come out here I — ” 

“ — you don’t wear any clothes. 
Tell me — where am I?” 

“Don’t you know?” 

“Let’s not play games. If I knew 
f wouldn’t ask you.” 

“Did you come on the ship?” 
“You saw me get out of it didn’t 
you? Now answer my question.” 
And he realized how certain he 
was of what her answer would be. 
“On Mythox.” 

“Well fancy that. 'Now tell me 
something else. Do you know what * 
language you’re speaking?” 

“Of course. English.” 

“And why should you speak 
English on Mythox? Haven’t you 
got a language of your own?” 
“Certainly. Rut you’re obviously 



HOWARD BROWNE 

from Earth. I thought you were a 
Watcher. I tried English. If you 
hadn’t responded I’d have spoken 
to you in the other Earth lan- 
guages.” 

“How many do you know?” 1 
“Eleven hundred and seventeen. 
With various dialects, four thou- 
sand and — ” • 

“There aren’t that many.” 

She looked puzzled. Then her 
face cleared. “Oh you mean Earth 
languages. 1 was referring to those 
of the Five Galaxies.” 

I’m not going to be surprised at 
anything, he told himself doggedly. 
Not at anything. “Do you know 
anyone named Naia North?” 

T here was a childlike serious- 
ness in her manner. It tended 
to deny the maturity of her body. 
Or was it the other way around? 
Martin Kirk wasn’t sure, and grim- 
ly assured himself that he didn’t 
give a damn. 

The girl said, “I don’t know any- 
one by that name. But I could find 
her for you.” 

“How would you go about it?” 
“I’d go to the city and check the 
video-directory, naturally.” 

“Naturally. And you’d put your 
clothes on before you went?” 

“Of course I would. We go with- 
out clothing only out here in the 
playground.” 

Kirk realized he’d been holding 
the gun rigidly in front of him. The 
tiger had dropped to the ground 
and lay outstretched like a lazy, 
good-natured dog. Kirk lowered the 
gun, setting his eyes again on the 
girl. “A minute ago you said you 




TWELVE TIMES ZERO 

thought I was a Watcher. What 
did you mean?” 

He would have framed his ques- 
tions with more guile, but some- 
thing told him it wasn't necessary. 
This child of nature was utterly 
without guile. She said, “An Earth 
Watcher. What did you think I 

meant?” 

“I didn’t know or I wouldn’t 
have asked.” 

It clarified. Dakin is watching. 
Sure. What the hell else would a 
Watcher do but watch? But why, 
and for what? Kirk was mystified. 
But it didn’t matter, he asserted in- 
wardly, and turned his mind back 
to the straight line. The cop’s line. 
“Will you put on your clothes and 
go into the city and locate Naia 
North for me?” 

“If it will help you” 

“It will. Where can I wait for 
you?” 

“If you want to see Naia North 
why don’t you come with me?” 

Kirk shrugged. Why not? So 
long as the score was completely 
unknown to him, why not follow 
the path of least resistance? “Get 
your clothes on,” he said. 

The girl turned and started lead- 
ing the tiger back toward a grove 
of trees. After a few steps she 
turned back, a look of sober 
thought on her face. “Are all 
Earthlings so assertive?” she asked. 
Kirk grinned. As long as it works, 
this one is, baby. But what if it stops 
working? His reply was not audible 
and the girl turned finally to dis- 
appear into the bushes. 

Kirk then experienced a strange 
feeling of unreality which persisted 
until the girl returned. 



41 

^TV/T Y name is Raima,” the 
JLYJL girl said solemnly. She 
wore tight-fitting trousers, a loose 
blouse and had a silver colored air 
car with room in back for the tiger. 

Kirk knew it was an air car 
whc;i the craft lifted from the 
ground from no apparent means 
of acceleration and skimmed along 
just above the trees. He sat beside 
Raima and asked, “About that ship 
I came here in? How fast does it 
travel and> how far is it from 
Mythox to Earth?” 

“The distance is around two 
hundred thousand light years but 
the ship doesn’t really travel at all.” 
“Maybe you could go into a little 
more detail,” Kirk said wearily. 

“It’s very simple. Distance, as 
you Earthlings regard it, is not dis- 
tance at all. Space bends to a 
greater or lesser degree depending 
upon its immediate function in 
whatever time-space equation you 
are using.” 

“Thank you very much,” Kirk 
replied and silently added: Keep 
to the line. Hold to your own 
values. On Earth, wherever it is, a 

J » r 

man is waiting to go to the chair 
for a murder he didn’t commit. Use 
whatever equation you want to — 
that still adds up the same. These 
people may be a lot smarter than 
you are, but they can’t twist that 
one and make you believe it comes 
out anv different. 

A strange city of graceful flying 
spirals was coming over the horizon. 
It moved closer and the air car 
arced in to a halt on a huge cement 
landing area punctuated with* small 
circles of a different material.

Kirk noted that none of 
them seemed in any hurry; that 
here and there was an individual 
dressed like himself. Watchers on 
furlough or vacation, he thought 
a trifle bitterly. This picture was far 
from complete but enough of it

“My! She’s pretty, isn’t she?” 
Naia North was entirely com-

and from the background in the

at home. “Aren’t you surprised?” 
Kirk asked. 

Now a slight frown creased the 
lovely Naia’s brow. “A little per- 
haps. How did you get to Mythox? 
And why did you come?” 

“A slight matter of murder. A 
murder you confessed to, or has it 
slipped your mind?” 

“Aren’t you being rather absurd?

The beautiful brow immediately 
cleared, “Oh, I see,” Naia observed 
with amusement, “And you know 
exactly how you’ll get me back to 
Earth I suppose? Thousands of 
light years. It’s a long walk.” 

‘Til take one thing at a time and 
worry about them in order of ap- 
pearance. The main thing for you 
to remember, is this: You may be 
as smart as all get out but you broke 
an American law on American soil 
by your own confession and by God 
you’re going back and answer for 
it!” 

“Idiot! I can have you — ” 

K irk’s mood changed to the 
quizzical. “It’s entirely be- 
side the point, but still I don’t get 
you, baby. Why the switcheroo? 
You walked in and confessed. Then 
you took a powder. Now' you sneer 
in my teeth. What do you use for a 
rudder, sweetheart.” 

“I followed orders,” Naia flared 
with a mixture of anger and sullen- 
ness. “I am now free of the assign- 
ment.” 

Kirk pursed his lips thoughtfully. 
“You wouldn’t be sort of a hatchet- 
wornan for this high-blown outfit 
would you? I can think offhand of 
a few other names. Karney, Blatz, 
Kennedy. What gives with knock- 
ing off nuclear physicists, baby?” 
Naia did not answer. When she 
started to turn away from the mir- 
ror , Kirk glanced at the silent 
Raima standing with her hand on 
the tiger’s head. “Is there any way 
I can call on the lady in the mirror 
personally?” 

“Not if she doesn’t want to re- 



ceive you,” Raimu said. She was 
studying Kirk with wistful dark 
eyes. 

' Naia turned back quickly. “Fll 
be glad to receive you. It’s time I 
taught you a lesson.” 

“Fine. What’s your address?” 
But Naia was gone. The little 
mirror turned opaque. Kirk shot a 
questioning glance at Raimu. “Does 
yes mean no on this cockeyed 
planet?” 

“Her car will come.” Raimu 
murmured. But the petite dark 
beauty seemed interested in other 
things. “You didn’t tell me your 
name.” 

“Sorry. Rude of me. It’s Martin 
Kirk. You’ve been pretty nice to 
me. I wish there was some way I 
could show my appreciation,” 
“You’re going to see Naia 
North?” 

“Yes. She’s a murderess. I’m tak- 
ing her back to my planet.” 

“I’m afraid that wouldn’t be 
possible.” 

“You too, honey?” Kirk reached 
out and flicked one of the raven 
curls. “If things were different you 
and I might be able to have fun.” 
“I spend a lot of time — where 
you found me. Maybe — ” 

“I doubt if I can make it. But 
keep your clothes on after this — as 
a personal favor to me.” 

She was the very soul of solem- 
nity. “I don’t understand you. I 
really don’t understand you at all.” 
At that moment, an air car — ■ 
much smaller than Raimu’s, 
dropped gently into the street be- 
side Kirk. “Good lord! Did this 
thing smell me out?” 

“It came to the mirror on Naiads

“You got your bag packed for a 
little trip, baby?” 

For a brief moment, genuine fear 
flamed in Naia’s eyes. And in Kirk’s 
mind: Dumb babe. What’s she got 
to be scared of? They hit you with 
nothing and make it stick. Kirk 
croaked, “Grab your bag, baby. 
We’ll go find that flying biscuit. We 
got a date with Arthur Kahler 
Troy.” 

He was really cagey this time. 
When the light beam shot out, he 
hurled himself to the side. But he 
could have saved the effort. A beam 
came from the other door jamb and 
he stepped right into it. That one 
really tore his head off. 

S omebody was talking. It was a 
man and he had a deep re- 
sonant voice: a voice full of 

authority— and censure. “I*m sur- 
prised at you Naia. I never sus- 
pected you of having a sadistic 
streak.” 

Naia’s sullen reply. “Do you 
think anyone can do the work I do 
and remain unmarked?” 

“I suppose not. But as I remem- 
ber it, you asked to serve.” 

“As a benefit to humanity.” 

“We won’t go into it.” 

But Naia pressed the point. “I 
have always followed orders. I 
placed myself in possible jeopardy 
on Earth by clearing Paul Cordell.” 
“But Paul Cordell was not 
cleared.” 

“Not through any fault of mine.” 
“But why this? What end does 
torturing this poor unfortunate 
serve?”. 

Martin Kirk cautiously opened 



one eye. It brought to his brain the 
image of a large blue globe, A man 
of fine and commanding appear- 
ance stood within the globe, sus- 
pended about a foot from the floor. 
The globe and the man gave every 
indication of having just come 
through the opaque glass wall of 
the room, and as Kirk watched, the 
man was lowered slowly to the 
floor and the globe became a blue 
mist that spiralled lazily and was 
gone. 

Kirk opened both eyes now, 
stirred, and climbed dizzily to his 
feet. “You bump into the damndest 
tilings around here,” he said. “But 
let’s get down to the important 
business. My name is Martin Kirk. 
I’m an American police officer. 
One of your subjects committed a 
murder on American soil. 1 hope 
you aren’t going to be difficult 
about extradition.” 

The other could not hide his sur- 
prise. Nor did he try to. “Amazing,” 
he murmured. Then, “I am Tamil, 
the overlord of the galaxy. I won- 
der if Naia’s cruelty hasn’t affected 
your mind?” 

“If you mean I’m nuts, I think 
maybe you’re right. But it wasn’t 
little Playful here who did it. I’ve 
gone through a lot and I don’t 
speak with any sense of bragging. 
I’ve seen more furiny things happen 
than any one man should see in so 
short a time. So maybe I am off 
my rocker. So I’d like your permis- 
sion to take my prisoner back to 
Earth so I can give all my time to 
regaining my sanity.” 

Tarau regarded Kirk with 
thoughtful eyes. “I think we should 
have a talk.” * 




46 



“I would like a talk. I would like 
nothing better than to chew the 
fat with you for hours on end if my 
jaw didn’t hurt so damned much. 
So PH just take my prisoner and 
go. Do I have to sign a paper or 
something?” 

The overlord’s surprise was fast 
becoming a kind of fascinated awe. 
“Kirk, you said?” He pointed to 
the door leading to the inner room. 
“Please go in, sir. There’s no use 
of our standing out here while we 
discuss your problem.” 

The Lieutenant eyed the door 
frame warily. “I tried getting 
through there before but the light 
got in my eyes!” 

“You can trust me.” 

The police officer stepped cau- 
tiously through the opening and on 
into a luxuriously furnished room. 
Tamu, dressed much the same as 
one of Earth’s better bankers, fol- 
lowed him in and suggested he sit 
down. 

“Why?” Kirk demanded bluntly. 
“Let’s stop kitten-and-micing 
around, Mr. Tarnu. I’m not com- 
fortable here and I want to leave. 
With her.” He tilted his head to- 
ward the watching, sullen-faced 
Naia North. “And now.” 

Tamu said, “Believe me, it will 
be as easy for you to return to Earth 
an hour from now. You seem weary 
to the point of exhaustion. I ask 
you again: sit down and get back 
some of your strength. Naia will 
find you something to eat.” 

Kirk’s stubborn determination to 
force an immediate showdown 
wavered. It had been born largely 
of fear to begin with, and • the 
thought of relief for his burning 



HOWARD BROWNE 

throat was impossible to resist. 

“I could use a drink,” he ad- 
mitted. 



T -amu gestured and Naia 
North turned to leave the 
room. But Kirk leaped forward to 
block her off. “Nothing doing! I 
don’t take my eyes off you, baby. 
I’ll just pass up that drink.” 

The girl glanced at the overlord 
and shrugged helplessly. Tamu said, 
“Have a girl bring in something. 
While we’re waiting I suggest all 
three of us get comfortable.” 
While Naia was speaking into a 
tiny screen set into one of the silk- 
covered walls, Tamu and the man 
from Earth sat down across from 
each other on a pair of fragile- 
legged chairs. The overlord leaned 
back and sighed. “You’ve asked my 
leave to return to Earth and to take 
Naia back with you to stand trial 
for murder. Have you considered 
that I may refuse that permission?” 
“I don’t think I have to con- 
sider it,” Kirk said promptly. 

“You don’t?” Tamu was mysti- 
fied again. “Why not?” 

“You tell me you’re the overlord. 
I take that to mean you’re in 
charge. That means you have laws 
to govern your people and that 
means you believe in laws. One of 
your subjects has broken the law of 
my country. You can’t refuse to let 
her take the consequences any more 
than if the situation was reversed.” 
Tamu was shaking his head and 
smiling slightly. “I’m afraid you’re 
not taking into consideration on& 
fact, Mr. Kirk. Naia North broke 
your law, as you call it, on express 




TWELVE TIMES ZERO 



and definite instructions from me.” 
Martin Kirk made a show of as- 
tonishment. “Let me get this 
straight. You ordered Professor Gil- 
more and Juanita Cordell mur- 
dered? Is that what you’re telling 
me?” 

“Yes.” 

“Why?” ' 

“Exactly the reason I suggested 
we have a talk. To make you see 
why they — and others in the same 
classification — could not be allowed 
to live.” * , '■ 

“Men like Karney? Kennedy? 
Blatz?” 

Tamu blinked. “My respect for 
you increases, Martin Kirk.” 

“Don’t let it throw you. I’m a 
police officer, and police officers are 
trained to do the job right.” 

The overlord crossed his legs and 
settled deeper into the chair. 
“Mythox needs men like you, Mar- 
tin Kirk. That is why I’m going to 
give you a chance for life. For this 
you must understand: if I wanted 
it, you would be dead within sec- 
onds.” 

A chill slid along the stubborn 
back of the Lieutenant but nothing 
showed in his impassive expression 
and he did not speak. 

“But because we do need you, I 
am going to tell you things no 
Earthman knows. I believe that 
once you understand why Mythox 
has undertaken to meddle in the 
affairs of another world— and I tell 
you frankly that our doing so is as 
abhorrent to us as anything you can 
imagine — once you understand our 
reasons, you will cheerfully, even 
eagerly, join us,” 

“And if I don’t?” . 



“You know the answer to that, 

A 

I’m sure.” 



A slim fair- haired girl in a pale 
green toga-like dress entered 
the room carrying a tray holding 
tall glasses of some sparkling blue 
beverage. She offered it first to 
Kirk, then the others. The Lieu- 
tenant removed one of the glasses, 
wajted until Tamu and Naia had 
done the same, but not until they 
had drunk some of the liquid did he 
tilt his own glass.* The cold tangy 
liquid hit him like a bombshell — a 
bombshell on the pleasant side. He 
could almost literally - feel his 
strength flow back, his senses 
sharpen and the poisons of fatigue 
and mental strain disappear. 

“I’m listening,” he said. 

Tamu set his glass on the edge of 
a nearby table and bent forward, 
his manner earnest. “It won’t take 
long. Martin Kirk. Hear me. We of 
Mythox are far in advance of the 
peoples of Earth — both spiritually 
and scientifically. Life on our plhnet 
materialized in much the same 
manner as on your own world, but 
countless ages before. Almost the 
same process of evolution took 
place ; but somewhere along the line 
humanity on 'Mythox managed to 
reach full development without the 
flaws of character found among so 
many of Earth’s inhabitants. When 
I tell vou that we find it almost im-

possible to voice an untruth, that 
taking a human life willfully for 
any reason is equally difficult, that 
crime of any nature is almost un- 
known here — then you will see the 
difference between the two planets*

That is not our way, Martin 
Kirk, Free will is our heritage too — 
and we respect it in ourselves, and 
that reason must respect it in

“And then one day we witnessed

the stolid face of Martin Kirk 
might as well have studied the con-

“The road to that blunder had

sisted down that path, it was bound 
to follow that they would attempt 
the thing we feared : the splitting of 
hydrogen atoms— the hydrogen 
bomb, as you call it.

thoroughly as we do our own. 
Fortunately for our purpose only a 
relative few have progressed along 
a line which can lead to danger for 
the rest. Yours is one of those which 
has — and that is why we of 
Mythox have taken a well-masked 
place in your affairs so far as they 
relate to nuclear physics. 

“Every scientist of your world, 
male or female, is constantly under 
the eye of a Watcher. These 
Watchers are members of your own 
races — people we have enlisted in 
the fight to save not just their world 
or mine — but millions of worlds. 

“When a W atcher learns a phys- 
icist is close to the one key to suc- 
cess in his effort to make a hydrogen 
bomb — an equation that begins: 
‘Twelve times zero point seven 
nine’ — we are notified and a killer 
from our own people is sent to 
execute that scientist. Yes, Martin 
Kirk, we have those among us — a 
very few— who are capable of kill- 
ing on orders and for cause. Naia, 
here, is one of them. She was sent 
to take the lives of Gregory Gilmore 
and Juanita Cordell; but she 
bungled and instead of their deaths 
resembling heart failure, they were 
obviously murdered. 

“Alma Dakin tried to cover up 
the truth by making it appear both 
scientists had died at the hands of 
a jealous husband. She succeeded, 
both because of her perjured testi- 
mony and the fact that Paul Cor- 
dell insisted on telling the truth. 
But when we of Mythox learned 
what had happened, Naia was sent 
back to confess the crime. She en- 
tered the laboratory only a few 
hours before she came ..to your 



office; while she was in the labora- 
tory the second time, the clues you 
found were put there. 

“Our mistake was in thinking 
that, once proof was offered clear- 
ing Cordell, the innocent man 
would be freed. For once more we 
credited Earthlings with the same 
code of ethics we of Mythox adhere 
to. 

“You succeeded in following 
Naia here. Only a man composed 
of equal parts of Earth bulldog and 
genius could have done so. Martin 
Kirk, I offer you a place among us 
and a lifetime devoted to making 
sure the galaxy of which we both 
are a part does not perish. What 
say you?” 

Several minutes dragged by. The 
eyes of both Tamu and Naia North 
were glued, to the grim visage of 
Homicide Lieutenant Kirk. It was 
impossible for either of them to 
know what thoughts were churning 
behind that stone face. 

Abruptly he stood up. “I’m a 
cop. I leave your kind of problem 
to the people who are good at it. 
My people, Tamu. You see, I be- 
long to my world, not to yours. 

“But you’ve got a solid argument 
— one I’d be a fool not to consider. 
Let me sleep ©n it. Tomorrow 
morning we’ll talk about it some 
more; then I’ll give you my answer. 
Right now I’m too worn out to 
think in a straight line.” 

“Of course.” The overlord rose 
to his feet. “Find Martin Kirk com- 
fortable quarters, Naia, and leave 
orders he is not to be disturbed until 
he is ready to join us.” 

On his way down a corridor be- 
hind the same slip of a girl who had 




50 



brought him his drink, Martin Kirk 
was thinking: They didn’t even 
frisk me for a gun! 

Martin Kirk went into his apart- 
ment and lay for a while looking at 
the ceiling. After a time, he got up 
and went out again. 



Chapter IX 

T he soft silvery radiance which 
this planet seemed to feature, 
bathed the metal hallway as Kirk 
marched stolidly toward the slim 
arcing stairway that led toward 
Naia’s floor. This was certainly a 
strange building, he thought. The 
architects of Mythox knew how to 
use curves. They utilized them for 
utility and beauty to a point where 
a straight line was something to be 
surprised at. Pretty smart people, 
the Mythoxians — in more ways 
than one. 

And Kirk, for no apparent rea- 
son, thought of a phrase comnion 
among children during his own 
childhood. “Who died and left you 
boss?” 

He counted the markings over 
one door. He had seen those mark- 
ings before. Naia North lived here. 

And Naia North was in. Kirk 
walked softly across the large foyer 
room and quietly pushed open a 
door to the left. Naia, clad as al- 
ways, in beauty, lay sleeping on a 
bed that stood out from the wall on 
two narrow rods of metal and 
needed no other support. 

As Kirk opened his mouth, Naia 
awakened, so she was looking calm- 



HOWARD BROWNE 

ly at him as he spoke. “Up, baby. 
You’ve got a date with a hot elec- 
trode a lot of light years from here. 
It’s a hike, so rise and shine.” , 

Naia sat up very slowly, very 
gracefully. She was what men 
dream of finding in bed beside 
them. What they marry to keep in 
bed beside them. 

“You must be mad” 

“As a hatter, baby. Into your 
duds.” He saw her glance at the 
door jamb of the bedroom en- 
trance, saw the shadow of disap- 
pointment in her lovely eyes. “You 
didn’t put those Joe Louis light rays 
in your bedroom, did you?” 

Naia set her feet on the floor and 
drew herself to her full height. She 
wore light blue, a gown that hung 
as had that of Guinevere, as that of 
the Maid of Shalot. 

But Naia was contempt. She was 
contempt clothed in cold blue* then 
contempt naked as she allowed the 
gown to fall to the floor. A few min- 
utes later, she was contempt clothed 
for the street in tight britches and 
a loose blouse. 

“You go first,” Kirk said. “And 
do as you’re told. You may be a 
Mythoxian, but this .45 doesn’t 
know that. It puts big holes in any- 
body.” 

As Naia walked serenely toward 
the hall door, there was only a 
touch of sullenness at the comers of 
her mouth. She turned her head 
to speak over her shoulder. “Hiding 
' behind a t woman, brave Earth- 
man?” 

“Yes and no. I’m hiding behind 
a woman from those damn straight- 
left rays, and Pm not a brave 
Earthman. I spend most of my time 




TWELVE TIMES ZERO 

scared to death. That’s why all of 
us are getting back to Earth quick, 
so I can draw an easy breath,” 

• “All of us?” 

* “Oh yes. Didn’t I tell you? 
Yoii’re taking me to the places I 
can find Alma Dakin and Orin. 
We’re going to have witnesses and 
testimony. And the party who gets 
burned isn’t going to be Paul Cor- 
dell.” 

“I won’t—” 

“Hold it, honey.” 

Kirk had picked up two items 
upon leaving Naia’s apartment. A 
pair of filmy silk stockings and a 
white scarf. He jerked Naia’s hands 
behind her back in somewhat of a 
surprise move. Before she recov- 
ered, her wrists were tightly bound. 
She gasped, “You — madman,” just 
before he deftly pulled the scarf 
across her mouth and twisted it into 
an effective gag. He stepped back 
to admire his handywork. 

“Now we’re all ready. Orin and 
Alma.” 

Naia shook her head in a slow' 
negative. Kirk pushed her gently 
into the hall and rounded to face 
her. “Yes, baby,” he said. “You 
ought to know now I won’t be 
stopped. I need Orin to fly that 
space buggy. If I don’t get him we 
can’t go. Then there’d be nothing 
left for me to do but even the score 
for Paul Cordell. He’ll have to go 
but you’ll keep him company.” 
Naia stood like ' a statue, ap- 
parently considering. Then she 
moved slowly down the corridor in 
the opposite direction from which 
Kirk had come. Down three curv- 
ing flights and stopping finally in 
front of a door identical to her own. 



L 

Kirk stepped forward and leaned 
firmly on the knob. The door 
opened. He knew where the bed- 
room was in these apartments now. 
He pushed Naia ahead of him, into 
the bedroom and saw Alma lying 
with her eyes dosed. 

Kirk whirled, just in time to level 
his gun and bring Orin to a dead 
stop. “Over by the bed, high-born.” 
As Orin complied, Kirk leered at 
Naia. “That was clever, but I had 
it doped. I spotted them for hus- 
band and wife or the Mythox 
equivalent quite some time back. A 
good chance shot to* hell.” 

“What do you want here?” Orin 
demanded. 

“A chauffeur. We’re heading 
Earthward on the first ship. That’s 
the one out in the jungle.” 

“But you talked to Tamu. I 
thought—” 

“I’d been suckered? No no my 
friend ! On the force they called me 
the boy with the one-track mind.” 

“I can see what they meant,” 
Orin sighed. 

“I thought you would. Tell your 
wife to get dressed. We’re getting 
an air- sled.” 

“You might have the decency 
to—” 

“I won’t turn my back. You can 
stand between us. That’s the best I 
can do.” 

A lma dressed swiftly in a 
costume similar to Naia’s. 
When they were ready to leave, 
Kirk said, “Now let’s get it straight 
once and for all. I’ll stand for no 
fast moves. It’s Earth or some quick 
slugs. Do you follow me?” 

They- did not speak but they evi-

dently believed Kirk because, fif- 
teen minutes later, the party of four 
stood beside the ugly ship while 
thick trees and grasses whispered 
around them. 

“Inside.” 

In the corridor, Orin stopped 
and turned as though having 
thought of a convincing argument 
he was bent upon trying. Kirk 
poked him sharply in the ribs with 
the barrel of the .45 and he moved 
on after the women toward the lad- 
der and thence to the motor room. 

Once inside, Orin turned and 
spoke sharplv. “Won’t you recon- 
sider?” 

“Push the levers, jack. The right 
ones.” 

“Tamu is a reasonable man. We 
could talk to him again. He would 
make even a more generous offer.” 
“I’m waiting.” » 

“Certainly you did not refute the 
logic of his argument? We are in 
the right. Our case is just. The 
galaxies must be protected from — ” 
“The right levers, Jack.” 

“ — from those who through ig- 
norance, stupidity,' or ferocity 
would destroy it.” 

“One more minute of .this and 
there’ll be dead people aboard this 
ship.” 

“You’re helpless, really. You 
can’t fly this ship without me. 
Therefore my life is safe. I merely 



refuse to launch it.” 

“Would you like a dead wife?” 
Orin whitened perceptibly. 

“She may be a wife to you, but 
to me she’s just a doll who helped 
lie a man into the chair.” 

“You wouldn’t do it! You 
haven’t got the nerve to shoot down 
a man or a woman in cold blood.” 
Kirk looked steadily into Orin’s 
eyes. “You don’t believe that do 
you, hud?” 

Orin held the gaze for a long 
time. Then he dropped his eyes. 
“No. I don’t believe it.” 

“Then get to work.” 

“One last offer. Won’t you re- 
consider. Join us?” 

“No!” 

“Very well.” 

And Orin, a fixed, taut look on 
his face, reached forth his hand 
and touched a button on the panel 
board. It was a very special button. 

A button for use only when all 
hope was gone. 

The exploding space-time ship 
lighted the countryside to blinding 
brilliance.

He stole a ride to the Moon in search of 
4 glory, but found a far different destiny. 



H IS EYES were a little feverish 
— as they had been of late — 
and his voice held a contin- 
uous intensity — as though he were 
imparting a secret. I’ve got to get 
on that ship! I’ve got to, I tell you! 
And I’m going to make it!” 

Different members of the group 
regarded him variously, 'some with 
amusement, some with contempt, 

others with frank curiosity. 

# 

“You’re plain nuts, Joe. What do 
you want to go to the moon for?” 
“Sure, why you wanna go? What 
they got on the moon we aint got 
right here?” 

There was general laughter from 
the dozen or so who sat eating their 
lunch in the shade of Building B. 
They all thought that was a pretty 
good one. Good enough to repeat. 
“Sure, what they got on the moon 
we ain’t got here?” 

But Joe Spain wasn’t in the 
rnood for jokes. He burned with 
even greater conviction and stood 



up as though to harangue the 
workers. “You wanta know why I 
got to go to the moon? Why I’ve 
got to get on that ship? Then PH 
tell you. It’s ’cause I’m a little guy 
— that’s why! Joe Spain — working 
stiff — one of the great inarticulate 
masses.” 

More laughter. “Where’d you get 
those big words, Joey? Out of a 
book? Come on — talk English!” 

Joe Spain pointed to the huge, 
tubelike Building A, off across the 
desert; the building you had to 
have- two different passes and a 
written permit to enter. The mys- 
tery building where even newspa- 
per reporters were barred. “It’s 
only the big shots they let in there 
ain’t it? Only them that’s got a 
drag or went to college or some- 
thing. Us little guys they tell go to 
blow — ain’t that right?” 

“Who the hell cares? Maybe it’s 
a damn good place to stay away 
from. Maybe it’ll explode or some-

Building B. Getting past the guard 
was a load off his mind. He’d ex- 
pected to get by, but it was one of 
the calculated risks tiiat could have 
stopped him cold. 

Once inside the building, he put 
the bag into his locker and went to 
work. He labored briskly and car- 
ried more than his share of the 
load. But now again he stopped to 
look over at the outline of Building 
A, limned hard against hot blaz- 
ing sky. And each time it was with 
a sense of heady exhilaration that 
he thought of his destiny — his hard 
earned, dearly bought destiny. To 
be among that select group who 
would first set foot upon the sur- 
face of the Moon! 

He had no worries about not be- 
ing allowed to do so. Once he 
showed himself — with the ship far 
out in space — they’d have to accept 
him. Not graciously of course, but 
they’d have to admire his courage 
and tenacity. They could not in all 
humanity, deny him a share of th£ 
victory. 

The day wore on and as quitting 
time approached, he became more 
tense — more alert. Five minutes be- 
fore the whistle, he faded back into 
the building and hurried to the 
lavatory. He went into* the booth 
furthest from the entrance and 
locked the door. Now there was 
nothing to do but wait. Another of 
the calculated risks. 

The whistle blew. Almost im- 
mediately, the sound of footsteps 
broke the silence and the lavatory 
was filled with hurrying men. Their 
stay in the room was short, how- 
ever, as Joe had known it would be. 
Men leaving for home do not daw- 



ALVlN heiner 

A 

die on the premises. 

The lavatory was empty again. 
A period of silence while Joe raised 
his feet from the floor and braced 
them on the toilet seat. The en- 
trance door opened. A guard mak- 
ing the departure checkup. 

Joe held his breath. If the guard 
came down the line and tried the 
door, he was finished. But Joe had 
banked upon human nature. The 
guard stopped. For a long .moment 
there was no sound and joe knew 
the man was bending over to run 
his eves down the line of toilets 

4 

close to the floor. In this manner 
he could see the floor of every 
booth. The guard straightened, 
turned, walked out. The door 
closed. Silence. Joe’s heart swelled 

with gratitude. He grinned, looking 
forward with joy to the long night 
ahead. 

He found a spot over behind the 
barrels where the night watchman 
would have to climb over a lot of 
equipment in order to find him. He 
made himself comfortable, prac- 
tically certain the guard would not 
do this. He stretched out on the 
hard floor and recorded the passing 
of the hours by the number of times 
the watchman went through. 

And he was surprised at how 
fast the time passed. Finally, check- 
ing his count carefully, he left his 
hiding place and tiptoed to the line 
of lockers. He took the oxygen 
equipment from the duffel bag af- 
ter which he hid the bag and the 
clothing therein behind a wall 
flange in a far corner.. Then he 
climbed into the barrel at the front 
end of the packing line. He checked 
the barrel with a small X and

jockeyed the lid into place.

T IME PASSED. Nothing hap. 

pened. He wondered if he’d 
missed on the time element. The 
men should certainly have come to 
work now. More than once he was 
fempted to push the barrel lid 
aside and check- the situation. 
When footsteps sounded, close by, 
and the lid snapped firmly into 
place, he was glad he hadn’t done 
so. Good old Nick! When he got 
back from the Moon, he’d see to it 
that Nick got credit for his coura- 
geous act. 

Soon the barrel began to move. 
Joe felt it rise into the air and settle 
with a thump. Then the motor of a 
truck roared and Joe knew where 
he was going. Straight toward 
Building A and the Moon rocket. 
There was more movement until 
finally the barrel was set down for 
what appeared to be the last time, 
joe put the nose-piece of the oxy- 
gen tube into place and visualized 
himself safe and snug in a storage 
room of the rocket. 

He closed his eyes and went 
peacefully to sleep. 

He slept a long time, to be awak- 
ened by a crushing — a wrenching — 
that all but drove his head down 
into his spine. The pain brought 
him sharply alert. He knew instant- ’ 
ly what had happened. 

Blast-off. 

He braced himself against the 
sides of the barrel and gritted his 
teeth. * - 

Soon it was better. Then no pres- 



57 

sure at all. Only the fierce happi- 
ness on his heart. He’d set a course 
and won through! He was on the 
way to the Moon! 

Joe let plenty of time elapse. He 
knew it was well over an hour later 
when he unlimbered the torch to 
cut an escape-hole in the barrel. 
This, he knew, would be tricky. 
He could easily burn himself. The 
heat would be intense. 

But it wasn’t too bad. The alum- 
inum cut quickly and in a matter 
of minutes, he was standing beside 
his barrel. As he’d suspected, it was 
a storage hold. The pitch darkness 
did not bother him. He’d come pre- 
pared with a small pencil flash 
that threw an adequate beam. 

He found the door, opened it 
and went out into a long passage- 
way . 

N OW HE’D covered the length 
and breadth of the ship. He’d 
found a lot of rooms — all in pitch- 
darkness. No observation ports. 

And no living thing. 

He stood frozen in one of the 
rooms while the beam of his flash 
picked out a code stenciled ©n a 
steel plate over some piece of ma- 
chinery. X59-306MY — Experimen- 
tal — Explosion Rocket — Moon. 

The flash dropped from Joe 
Spain’s fingers. He stood in the 
pitch darkness while the jets vibrat- 
ed through the rocket. 

But there was no fear in him. 
Only the great pain of futility. Only 
his tears, and his whispered words: 
“They’ll never know. Nobody 
won’t ever know!”

control her circulatory and glandu- 
lar systems in such a way that fatty 
deposits would appear where she 
desired them and disappear in 
other places so that she could 
change her features and her form 
at will, as he himself had done. 

Of one thing he was certain : Her 
paranoid pride would not permit 
her to assume a guise regarded as 
ugly by this world. Most certainly 
she would make herself strikingly 
beautiful. 

San Rorrek however had reduced 
his body-weight, padded his cheek- 
bones to give himself a gaunt ap- 
pearance, dyed his hair black and 
his skin a sallow shade. An irritant, 
rubbed into pinpricks on his face, 
resulted in mild acne that made 
him something less than handsome. 
He smeared his teeth with 
brown stain, wore shabby sec- 
ond-hand clothing, and a pair of 
plain-rimmed glasses. He was not 
here to attract attention ; he 
was here to kill. He looked like a 
peddler or a laborer out of a job. 

He was walking down a side- 
street at midnight when he caught 
the first faint aura of her presence. 
She was somewhere within a few 
blocks, and she was planting a sug- 
gestion in the mind of the Terran 
who would not recognize the source 
of the thoughts as stemming from 

outside his own consciousness. 

* 

Sweee-whew! Thai dame on the 
corner! Did she look at me? Think 
Til walk that way. 

This was it! San had not reached 
out to touch the Terran 5 s mind, for 
in doing so he would broadcast his 

own thought-aura and reveal his 
presence to Klia. He had merely 



listened to Kfia’s planting of the 
thought in the Terran* s mind, and 
he caught the general direction 
from whence it came. He began 
walking rapidly up the street, then 
cut through the blackness of an 
alley. 

Was she playing games, or had 
she chosen a Terran to be of some 

service to her? Perhaps she was 
bored, and only wanted a brief 
love-affair. 



A T THE END of the alley, he 

. paused to peer toward both 
intersections. There were a few 
people on the sidewalk, but no 
woman tail enough to be Klia. He 
jaywalked and darted down the 
next alleyway. If the Terran had 
responded immediately to her sug- 
gestion, they would perhaps be 
gone before he could reach them. 

But then he caught another brief 
flash of thought*^-not words, but 
an image. She was helping the Ter- 
ran imagine what she might look 
like without clothing. San chuckled 
as he trotted ahead. Unknowingly, 
she had given him a clue as to her 
appearance. Through glandular 
control, she had apparently padded 
herself to a remarkable condition 
of mammalian grandiloquence. 
The effect was almost surrealistic; 
the way a male might design a 
female if he had any choice in the 
matter. 

‘‘You liked that, eh?” snarlecl a 
quiet voice from the darkness of a 
doorway. 

He stopped abruptly ■ in mid- 
, alley, caught in a puddle of moon- 
light. She had tricked him. There 




had been no Ter ran. The phoney 
suggestion had been a trap. He 
glanced quickly around. 

“Don’t move,” she snapped. 
“I’ve got a native gun on. you — a 
projectile weapon, in case you 
aren’t familiar with their artifacts.” 
Fie stood in stony silence, staring 
at the doorway until he made out 
her faint shadow. There was a tiny 
venom-gun strapped to his wrist, 
but its action would not be immedi- 
ate, and if he used i*t, she would 
have ample time to kill him before 
she died. If it came to that he 
would use it, but now he hesitated, 
trying to piece together her im- 
mediate intentions. 

He shrugged and grinned. 
“Okay. So I lost. Shoot and get it 

over with.” 

“Not here. They’d run an autop- 
sy on you, pastoral. They’d figure 
you weren’t quite Terran.” 

“Fm no pastoral. Pm an inven- 
tive.” 

“It’s all the same to me, Rorrek. 
You’re a lousy Thirder, Now 
move! Stay in the moonlight and 
walk slow. Stop when you come to 
the street. HI be right behind you.” 
“Where are we going?” 

“Shut up! And don’t start mak- 
ing suggestions at a policeman, or 
I’ll kill you.” 

Rorrek started walking. He felt 
her thoughts scanning lightly 
through various regions of con- 
sciousness-patterns until she found 
a taxi-driver. Then: 1 gotta hunch 
there's a customer on the next 
street . Think Til turn right. 

The taxi was approaching the 
alley entrance as they emerged. 
“Flag it,” she ordered. Rorrek 



obeyed grim-lipped. 

“You get in first, darling,” she 
said in a pleasant tone. “I like to 
sit on the right” 

“That’s just because I’m right 
handed, dear,” he purred acidly. 
“Where to, sir?” 

Out of the city , the girl ordered 
Rorrek wordlessly. Tell him . 

“Ask her. She’s boss.” 

The gun jabbed him ruthlessly 
in the ribs. The driver grinned. 
“Where to, lady?” 

She hesitated. “A long trip?” 

“I low long?” 

“Oh, thirty, forty miles. North.” 
“It’ll cost you.” 

“That’s all right. Will twenty 
dollars do it?” 

“Maybe. Watch the meter and 
double it. You’ll have to pay 
both ways.” 

“Let’s go.” 

Rorrek glanced at her sourly as 
they moved through the traffic. 
She had been exaggerating only 
slightly with the mental image used 
to trap him. The platinum blonde 
hair, the gray eyes, the aristocratic 
features, the full, slightly cynical 
mouth — she conformed perfectly to 
the beauty standards of this world. 
The black dress revealed things 
that would have won her first place 
in any of the inane native female 
contests. 

“You’ve done well by yourself, I 
see,” he said, eyeing the expensive 
clothing and jewelry. 

What tele path couldn’t? And 
stop talking aloud . 

He watched her for a moment. 
The gun was in her handbag. So 
was her hand. And she was keeping 
a sharp eye on him. Rorrek 




frowned* No opening yet. 

Where are we going? 

Someplace where you can dig a 
hole without being seen. / 

Rorrek stared ahead at the traf- 
fic for a moment. He didn’t need 
to ask her what the hole was for. 



T HE DRIVER was approach- 
ing an intersection and the 
light was just changing from green 
to red. Having heard the girl sum- 
mon the taxi, Rorrek knew the 
man’s consciousness pattern. He 
adjusted to it quickly and planted 
a rapid suggestion: Damn the 

light ! 1 can make it! 

The girl cursed and lifted the 
handbag. The light was already 
red. A car shot out from the other 
street. The brakes screamed. A po- 
lice- whistle shrilled angrily. 

“Shoot,” Rorrek dared, smirk- 
ing at Klia. 

The handbag hesitated. “Make a 
wrong move and I’ll have to.” 
The driver was too busy with 
his own troubles to hear them. The 
cop came stalking across the pave- 
ment. “You like to live dangerous- 
ly, huh?” he said in a bored voice. 

The cabby began a plaintive ex- 
planation. 

“Come on, dear,” said Klia. 
“We’ll catch another cab ” 

“I like this one,” « 

Get out , or Fll kilt you and the 
cop too. Pay the driver. 

Rorrek handed the driver a dol- 
lar. They crossed to the sidewalk 
and the girl looked shaken. This 
was a busier street and there were 

* m 

more pedestrians. He grinned at 
her again*. 



“May I buy you a drink before 
you finish me off?” 

Surprisingly, she replied, “Fll let 
you live that long, pastoral. It’s in- 
teresting to watch you try to wig- 
gle out of it.” 

He knew she meant it. She could 
have hypnotized the cop and the 
driver, shot him in the cab,» and 
strolled calmly away as one of a 
dozen multiple mental images. She 
could still do it, but evidently the 
idea of making him dig his own 
grave appealed to her icy sense of 
humor. 

They entered a small bar and 
she directed him toward a secluded 
booth. “I’m surprised you haven’t 
used your wrist weapon yet,” she 
said as they sipped a martini. “Ap- 
parently you pastorals have no ca- 
pability for self-sacrifice.” 

His face showed no surprise, but 
he rested his arm across the table. 
He smirked. “I was waiting for a 
better opportunity, but since you 
put it that way let’s get it over 
with.” His other hand darted to- 
ward the lethal wrist. 

“One moment,” she said. 

He paused. 

“Do you have an extra projec- 
tile?” 

He frowned, then nodded. 

She smiled again, and laid a 
braceleted white arm across the 
table. “I’ll skve you the trouble of 
firing. Prick me with it.” 

His throat started with surprise. 
“You’re not immune,” he hissed. 

“To Ayoyo venom? Try me.” 

Rorrek gained new admiration 
for her. The process of immuniza- 
tion was an excruciatingly painful 
treatment covering three years and

“An artificial category. An in- 
ventive is a maladjusted pastoral 
who wishes he were 1 a Klidd.” 

Her use of the ancient feudal 
name for her race startled him. His 
people had almost forgotten it. 
Once on Nu Phoenicis IV there 
had been the Klidds, or barons, the 
Algum or serfs, and the Taknon, 
or artisans. The feudal system had 
lasted more than five thousand

Rorrek kept his hands in sight. 
He stared at the cop, suggesting 
nausea, suggesting a fluttering of 
the heart, suggesting asphyxiation. 
The cop began to gasp and reel. 
Rorrek increased the mental dos- 
age. The cop choked and fainted. 

As Rorrek walked calmly out 
into the night, he heard voices be- 
hind him telling that the girl was 
dead. He felt sick himself now. 
There was something compelling 
about Klia, something that at- 
tracted. He felt a little like a child,

Terra possessed the only human 
life in the galaxy. 

So he was stuck here for life un- 
less a Taknon ship came to pick 
him up, and there had been no 
guarantee of that from the Com- 
mission. Secret landings on non- 
spacegoing planets were forbidden 
except in several specifically de- 
fined emergencies. Rescuing a sec- 
ond-class agent was not one of 
them. , 

He was faced with a life of ease 
but of loneliness. A telepath would 
have no difficulty acquiring tre- 
mendous wealth here, but a tele- 
path would have no company — un- 
less he could find a few natives 



a husband, lured to a wantonly 
selfish and unfaithful* mistress. He 
knew she had to be killed, yet now 
that it was done, he felt rotten 
inside.

and patient hypnotic conditioning, 
their latent abilities could be 
brought forth. If the genetic hodge- 
podge could be straightened out,

Terran had high possibilities. Their" 
basic genetic emotion-patterns were 
not as sharply divided into groups 
a£ those of Nu Phoenicis, but the 
patterns were present, and the con- 
flict among them was present. 
Rather than calling them Pastorals, 
Inventives, and Imperials, as in the 
Phoenician case, he decided per- 
haps that the basic Terran-pattems 
could best be described by the goals 
they were inclined to favor. The 
“Security-Seekers”, the “Knowl- 
edge-Seekers”, and the “Glory- 
Seekers” perhaps. 

Phoenician code forbade any 
tampering with non-threat cultural 
forms, but who was there to enforce 
it? And in a sense, this was his 

planet now. Marooned here, he 
could participate in a subtle ^way, 
and help a few local inventives find 
new directions. Maybe he owed 
them that much for killing Klia, 
who would certainly have steered 
them spaceward, although the end 
result would have been disastrous 
for them, had her plan worked. 

HE FIRST WEEK in San 
Francisco he spent replenish- 
ing his funds through poker games, 
wrestling matches, and various 
forms of betting in which thought- 
projective powers were a distinct 
advantage. Then he rented a house 
in the suburbs, ordered half a ton 
of various electronic parts, and be- 
gan building several computer units 
while he concentrated on revising 
his physical appearance to a more 
pleasing form. 

As the weeks passed, he put on 
weight, removed the fatty tissue 



from his cheekbones, thickened his 
cheeks enough to remove the 
gauntness, and restored his com- 
plexion to a healthier hue. When 
he was finished, he had the appear- 
ance of a gregarious young busi- 
nessman, cleanly attractive but not 
offensively handsome. 

He finished the computer shortly 
after he finished himself. It was 
not a large unit as computers went. 
It was built into a chassis the size 

of an eight-foot refrigerator. A Ter- 
ran might say it was constructed 
to handle problems in that rarefied 
strata of mathematics known as the 

4 

Von Neumann theory of games. 
But the twenty-four instruments on 
its face were calibrated in “points 

per share”. 

Rorrek spent a month in li- 
braries, photographing stock-mar- 
ket reports covering a thirty-year 
period. These he laboriously 
studied, plotting the rise and fall of 
each stock on graphs, writing em- 
pirical equations to describe each 
graph, and feeding the equations to 
the computer’s memory tanks. Fed 
also into the tanks, were thirty-year 
record-equations describing tax- 
rates, population growth, national 
income, government expenditures, 
world armaments, exports, imports, 
and average individual incomes. 
The computer, required to assume 
that all the variables were depend- 
ent upon one another, evolved an 
implicit function in some thirty- 
seven variable quantities. 

He then fed it the “present con- 
ditions” and required it to extrapo- 
late the values forward over a 
period of two months. Eleven 
stocks appeared due for sharp rises 





66 



WALTER MILLER, JR. 



within the period. San Rorrek in- 
vested ten thousand dollars. At the 
end of two months, the stocks had 
risen fifteen thousand. He cor- 
rected the small errors in the com- 
puter's estimates by supplying new 
data, then extrapolated again, sell- 
ing and reinvesting in accordance 
with the new predictions. There 
was danger, of course, that a com- 
pletely unpredictable series of 
events might occur to cause unfa- 
vorable market fluctuations. There- 
fore he very carefully watched 
world conditions, political develop- 
ments, and technical advance- 
ments. 

Klia’s articles were still appear- 
ing in magazines and technical 
journals, but that was not surpris- 
ing, considering the usual lag be- 
tween the acceptance of an essay 

and its publication. And the pieces 
were having subtle repercussions in 
the news, attracting no attention in 
themselves, but spurring certain 
scientists to think along new lines. 
Klia had suggested a method for 
testing basic mental formative pat- 
terns in infancy; and now a western 
university’s psychology department 
was setting up a research lab “for 
studying the basic affective reac- 
tion patterns of infants at birth”. 

Klia, under another pen-name, 
had suggested an extension of rela- 
tivistic mechanics to cover hypo- 
thetical N-dimensional universes. 
The newspapers announced now 
that the famous mathematician, 
Larwich, was beginning work on 
the creation of a mathematical 
physics with no basic assumptions 
other than those of elementary 
arithmetic. “Man’s only insight into 



reality,” said Larwich, “derives > 

from his ability to count on his fin- 
gers. All else is purely experiential 
approximation.” 

Rorrek grinned. Klia had been " 
trying to steer Terran inventors 
straight toward a five -space inter- 
stellar drive, while the government • 
was still spending billions on rocket 
research in the hope of reaching the 
moon. She was trying to get the 
mathematicians to see the velocity 
of light as a constant only at one 
specific universe-level of five-space, 
and as a different constant at other 
levels. And she had managed to 
steer Larwich in the right direction. 

Only one thing was lacking: an 
experiential tie between observable 
reality and the theory Larwich 
would certainly develop. Without' 
it, the theory would remain merely 
abtruse mathematical speculation 

of an invariantive nature. Rorrek’s 
fingers itched at the typewriter, 
longing to supply the missing sug- 
gestion. A guilt-reaction, he told 
himself, probably associated with 
Klia’s death. 

Nevertheless he wrote an essay 
entitled “Origin of Interstellar 
Hydrogen”, and sent it to a univer- 
sity press periodical. The article 
suggested that the spontaneous ap- 
pearance of matter in the four- 
space cosmos could be explained in 
terms of a five-space continuum 
with a circulation of matter along 
the fifth component. 

The essay was rejected with a 
brief note from the editor: “Sorry, 
but we just last week purchased an 
essay dealing with the mechanics of

.soon. Editor. 5 ’ 

Rorrek snorted and chucked the 
essay in the wastebasket. Some lo- 
cal yokel had probably beat him to 
the draw with some weirdly em- 
pirical notion that left out the tie 
with five-space. 

The rejection irritated him. He 
decided to give it up for a while, 
and concentrate on making himself 
a millionaire. Then he learned .that 
Dr. Larwich was in San Francisco 
for the summer. After some debate 
about the desirability of direct in- 
tervention, he found the professor’s 
address— a modest cottage over- 
looking the bay with a short stretch 
of narrow beach before it. 



M ORREK RENTED a cottage 
half a mile away. Three days 
later he wandered 1 past the pro- 
fessor’s cottage, having spied three 
brown todies sunbathing on the 
beach before it. As he drew nearer, 
he studied them curiously. An eld- 
erly couple and a girl in her late 
twenties, possibly Larwich’s daugh- 
ter. She was watching him casually 
— a large, dark girl with hazel eyes 
and firm breasts. 

Rorrek approached 'the group. 
“Am I still on a public beach?” he 
asked, “Or am I a trespasser?” 
The elderly couple glanced up 
questioningly. The girl smiled. 
“Trespassers are welcome. Help 
yourself.” She had a nice musical 
voice. 

“I’ve got the next cottage down 
the line,” he said. “Bui I scarcely 
realized I had neighbors.” 

“It is lonely out here. Won’t you 
sit with us awhile? You look tired.” 



Rorrek grinned and patted a 
slight bulge in his mid-section. 
“Trying to work off my bay win- 
dow.” He strolled toward them, 
scraping his feet in the sand. 

The old man looked down at his 
own sagging belly, then glowered 
at the stranger. “Young man, you 
have just committed a grievous 
faux pas, 3 ' he grunted. 

“I’m Edith Larwich,” said tke 
girl. “This is my father. Frank Lar- 
wich . and my mother, Louise.” 
He nodded and sat down. “I’m 
Sam Rory.” He hesitated, looking 
at the professor and gathering a 
frown. “Larwich — Frank Larwich 
— I’ve heard of you, I think. Is it 
Doctor Larwich — of the new-look 
in invariantive viewpoints?” 

The old man looked surprised. 
He lifted his eyebrows first at his 
wife, then his daughter. He ex- 
tended his hand to Rorrek and 
looked a beam of amusement down 
his slender nose. “Young man, you 
have just absolved yourself of that 
faux pas. What school are you 
with?” 

“No school.” 

“What research lab, then?” 

“No lab, I’m a gambler.” 

“Bah! Stop joking. Laymen 
don’t talk about invariance, or re- 
member the names of old codgers 
like me.” i 

He shrugged, “I apologize for be- 
ing a layman, sir, but I like mathe- 
matics. I’ve read a few of your 
pieces in the digest.” 

Larwich glanced at his wife and 
daughter again. They were looking 
curiously at Rorrek. 

“My fame comes as a distinct 
shock to me,” the old man said

that T erran-humanity was going

“Not at all, Quite friendly, I’d

Rorrek watched her plunging 
gracefully in the surf, and he won- 
dered at his vague uneasiness. 

• “What do you really do, Sam?” 
Larwich asked. 

“Investor. I hit it lucky on the 
market. Gambler — same thing ” 

. Larwich chuckled. “You evi- 
dently read technical publications 
as a hobby, then. Or are you work- 
ing on a mathematical way to beat 
the stock market?” 

Rorrek smiled enigmatically, and 
got to his feet. “You might try the 
Von Neumann theory of games,” he 
offered, then smiled sheepishly. “If 
you'll excuse me, I think I’ll join • 
your daughter for a swim.” 

S HE WAS far out beyond the 
feeble breakers when he trotted 
through the shallow water, but she 
rolled on her back to wave ' and 
watch him. A very beautiful, in- 
telligent girl, he thought calculat- 
ing! y. If he were to remain ma- 
rooned on Terra, it would be 
interesting to see if normal procrea- 
tion could result from marriage 
with a native. He felt an urge to 
touch the girl’s mind, then decided 
against it for the present. Some 
Terr an s seemed sensitively recep- 



tive, and they became startled by 
undue power. 

She lay treading water until he 
swam up beside her, then she 
smiled but her eyes were thought- 
ful. 



“Water’s nice!” he grunted. 

“Is it?” 

He frowned. “Why the challen 
ing tone ?” 

Who are you, anyway?” 

Just who I said I was. Sam 
Rory, gambler, investor.” 

She said nothing more about It, 
but her eyes were suspicious. They

swam in silence for a time, then 
she called. “How’s the beach down 

-V ' 

at your place?” 

He hesitated. Was she angling? 
“Just fine ” he said. “Why don’t 
you come down?” 

She lifted her wet head from the 



tide and nodded soberly. “I will. 
Very soon.” 

Again he felt the vague uneasi- 
ness. 

Rorrek spent the afternoon on 
his porch, watching the bay. To- 
morrow he meant to go back to 
the suburbs, return to the task of 
making hirnself the wealthiest man 
in the country as quickly as pos- 
sible, then start endowing univer- 
sities with research grants like a fat 
old capitalist with a guilty con- 
science. 

Twilight came, and he felt the 
loneliness of an alien longing for 
home. He visualized the warm, roll- 
ing hills of Phoenicis III, dotted 
with pastoral Algun villages, and 
the great walled city-states of the 
Taknon, covering hundreds of 
square miles and set in the midst 
of the Algun landscape. They 




70 



worked in harmony, the two races 
— each maintaining its own govern- 
ment, each keeping itself socially 
and biologically separated, yet each 
realizing that one could not exist 
and prosper without the other. It 
was a class society that worked, 
worked because the classes were di- 
vided according to the goals they 
sought, not according to any arti- 
ficial framework. Of course, Man’s 
goals were chosen in the light of 
his emotions and aptitudes, and at 
least among the Phoenicians, emo- 
tion and aptitude patterns were 
founded on genetic bed-rock. It 
was only rarely that Taknon apti- 
tudes were bom in an Algun vil- 
lage, and equally rare when a pas- 
torally inclined child appeared in 
the Taknon cities. 

Loneliness weighed heavily on 
him. With some misgivings he 
closed his eyes, and searched 
through the transor regions for the 
Larwich girl’s pattern of conscious- 
ness. When he passed through it, 
he started up with a low gasp — 
and lost the pattern. There had 
been a knife-edge sharpness about 
it — a clarity of focus that suggested 
resonant neural circuits as in the 
trained telepath. He groped for it 
again. 

But when he found it, the sharp- 
ness was gone — if it had really 
been there. The transor was strong 
but blurred, unreadable. He de- 
cided his first impression had been 
illusion. 

I wonder what that young man 
is doing ? he suggested. He did in- 
vite me to his beach. Maybe if 1 
walked down that way . 

He paused a moment, trying to 



WALTER MILLER, JR. 

catch the blurred images that swam 
in leisure through her conscious- 
ness. But they were too muddled. 
He withdrew from her and waited. 
Half-a-mile might be too far for 
the untrained mind to catch the 
faint suggestion, and even though 
she would mistake the thoughts for 
her own, she might offer herself 
some counter-excuse for not com- 
ing.

H E WATCHED the cottage in 
the failing gray of twilight. 
After a few minutes, the screen 
door opened, and someone stood on 
the porch. Then she trotted down 
the steps to the beach and came 
walking his way, but looking to- 
ward the sea. As she drew nearer; 
he saw that she was wearing white 
shorts and a pale blue blouse with 
the tail knotted about her^ waist. 
The wind whipped the blouse 
against her breasts and ruffled her 
short dark hair like a nest of feath- 
ers. He watched her come toward 
him with narrow speculative eyes, 
and he wondered again: Was a 

procreative union possible here? 

She looked toward him and 
waved, breaking his reverie, then 
on apparently sudden impulse 
turned and plodded through the 
sand toward his porch. 

“Am I trespassing? Or did you 
invite me to your beach?” 

“Come on up,” he called. “I was 
just wishing you’d drop by.” 

She hooked her foot on the step 
and cocked her head at him. 
“Why?” 

It startled him. “The answer to 
that,” he chuckled, “might be

“Only in t respectively so. 1 have

legs on the rail. “The subject is a

ear. 5 * 

“Mrnmp! How about a nice 
thick steak with onions and french 
fries and a gallon of beer?” 

“The bloated subject would fall 
asleep in her cage” 

“Exactly. 55 

She watched him with cool 
amusement in the dusk. “I think 
we find each other attractive.” 

“Tm glad it’s mutual. I have 
plans for you. 5 * 

She dropped her legs, rested her 
elbows on her knees, and swung 
half around to grin peculiarly, head 
cocked up at him. “Okay, Sam. 
Finish the funny story.*’ 

He leaned* toward her and tried 
to steal as softly as possible into her 
consciousness pattern, but he kept 
his voice light and casual. 

“The plan is simple biology, but 
it involves many unknowns as yet 
For instance — ” 

He pulled her face toward him 
slowly, and moulded her mouth 
with his. Quietly they slipped to 
their feet, locked tightly together, 
laughing quietly with soft fire 
where their faces touched. He 

brought his mind slowly into full 

resonance with her pattern, de- 
manding her to respond. 



The response was white flame, 
but not of the body. His mind 
reeled for an instant before he un- 
derstood. Full focus ! Too bright! 
And something hard against Ms 
ribs. 

You should have been born a 
Klidd! 

He backed away, staring at her, 
and the glint of metal in her hand. 

I wasn't certain , she went on un- 
til you threw that full resonance at 
me. 

“Klia!” 

“Yes.” She found a cigaret with 
her left hand and lit it while she 
held the gun on him with her 

right. He could see her face in the 
match-flare, and it appeared tight 
and drawn. 

“Your lipstick is smeared,” he 
offered. 

“Thanks. It was a pleasure. Fm 
really sorry 1 have to kill you ” 

“Like you killed Larwich’s blind 
daughter and took her place?” 

Klia snorted. “She*s not dead. 
She’s still blind, and she’s an am- 
nesiac in a Pennsylvania psycho- 
pathic ward.” 

“Hypnotically induced amnesia, 
undoubtedly.* 5 

“Right. I had to get her person- 
ality patterns, and leave her a 
blank” 

“I thought I left you dead on 
the floor.” 

She sighed impatiently. “Would 

a Terran know when a Phoenician 
was dead?” 

Rorrek saw his blunder and' 
gritted his teeth. He’d been a fool 
to believe. Naturally, every time 
someone touched her wrist to test 
her pulse, she had simply stopped 




72 



her heartbeat until the fellow let 
go, or perhaps shut off the circula- 
tion in the arm. 

“Well, you’ve got Larwich well 
on the road to the theory of a space 
drive, I see.” 

She nodded, started to reply, 
paused, then: “You didn’t suspect 
me because you thought I was 
dead. Then why did you come 
prowling around Larwich?” 

“To do what you’ve already 
done.” 

“You’re lying.” 

“See for yourself,” He began 
sliding into resonance with her, but 
she bached away warily and 
blocked him out. 

“You can break it whenever you 
want to,” he said. 

She risked it, and their transors 
found sharp focus again. He reeled 
off the contents of his associative 
circuits relating to Larwich and his 
theory, reeled them off too rapidly 
for them to be inventions of the 
moment. Then he switched to 
memories concerning his thoughts 
of her. 

“Why did you do that?” she 
muttered when he was through. 
Her voice was shaky, and the gun 
seemed to be sagging in her hand. 

He shrugged. “We’re a long way 
from Nu Phoenicis. I expect to be 
here for good.” 

“You will be,” she said ominous- 
ly, straightening. “Start marching 

down to the water.” 

“Why?” 

“The tide’s going out. You’ll go

“Suppose I suggest we work to-

quickly, Taknon!” 

He walked slowly down the steps 
and into the faint moonlight. He 
moved ahead with a calm leisurely 
tread. Behind him the girl laughed. 

“You’re part Klidd, Rorrek. A 
hybrid — or a throwback.” 

He failed to ask her why. 

“I could feel affection for a Tak- 
non, but I couldn’t love one. Fve 
watched you. You’re part Klidd. I 
can feel it.” 

He wondered why his throat con- 
stricted. He said nothing. 

“I love you, Rorrek. Damn your 
hide.” 

But she loved her planet more. 
“What are you going to do about 
Larwich now?” he asked coldly. 
“Are you going to switch to 
someone else, or are you going to 
keep on brazening it out?” 

“Switch. I’m through with him. 
He’s on the right course,” 

Rorrek started wading into shal- 
low water. 



“Go on out past the breakers,” 
she called. “I don’t want you to 
wash back in.” 

“Glad to oblige,” he grunted, 
but he paused to look back. She 
had kicked off her sandals and was 
wading after him. 

She stopped, gun glinting in the 
moonlight. “Well?” 

“’One thing.” 

He scanned for her mind, but 
she blocked, refusing him reso- 
nance. He bludgeoned through un- 
til he made a strong but fuzzy con- 
tact. He held the contact, but 
turned away and began wading 
through the gentle rush of breakers 
while he wandered through his as- 
sociative circuits concerning

BITTER VICTORY 

Stop it, Rorrek! 1 
Then the resonance was com- 
plete., and he chuckled, because she 
was going to feel it when she shot 
him. Beyond the breakers, he 
turned again to fac£ her. She was 
reeling dizzily, holding the gun at 
arm’s length, with her left hand 
pressed tight to her face. 

H E WAS unprepared for the 
shots when they came. Two 
went wide, but the third seared his 
chest, and he went down, fighting 
for air. hearing a choking scream 
from Kiia. He gasped once and 
went under, swimming weakly for 
deeper water. Another bullet 
streaked phosphorescence through 
the blackness about him. He drove 
still deeper, clinging precariously 
to consciousness. Another slug 
streaked under him ar\d he veered 
upward. Seven cartridges in the 
gun, five gone. If he could only live 
a little longer. 

Then he had to rise for air. He 
spun around and came up slowly, 
facing shore. She was walking de- 
jectedly back across the beach to- 
ward his cottage. He waited for her 
to look back. He dog-paddled with 
the waves, but the tide seemed to 
be sweeping him out. 

“PraTaW Bladen, Klia! 93 he 
choked in their native tongue. “For 
the love of Man!” 

She heard him. She turned slow- 
ly, watched him coldly for a mo- 
ment, pistol lifted high. 

" PraTalf Kliddn, TaknonV 9 
came her icy paraphrase. 

The gun barked, and barked 
again. Seven! But this time it was 



his abdomen, and he heard himself 
screaming as he fought toward 
shore. He could only partially con- 
trol the flow of blood to the 
wounds. When tissue cried for 
blood, the unconscious reflex let it 
go. It was like holding one’s breath, 
and occasionally he had to bleed. 

She was standing there watch- 
ing him, white in the moonlight, 
locked in a kind of trance. 

Co, he thought at her savagely. 
When 1 get there , Vll kill you — for 
those last two shots. 

She looked at the gun in her 
hand. She let it drop, stared down 
at it, wiped the hand distastefully 
on her shorts. She backed away a 
step, stumbled in the sand, and sat 
down, rolling her head on her 
knees. He groped for her mind, and 
she erected no block. She hoped he 
would die before he got to shore, 
but she wasn’t going to move. 

Fate, about to be satisfied — it 
gave him angry strength. A breaker 
washed over him from behind, and 
he rode with it briefly. When it 
passed him by and dropped him, 
he stood chest-deep, wading shore- 
ward. He peered at her dazedly, 
hands clenching and unclenching 
in anticipation. He let her feel the 
strength of his hate, but her 
thoughts were wandering — her 
home, her people. But she saw them 
differently somehow, as if she were 
no longer capable of being guided 
by their values. Her affective 
framework had collapsed. She sat 
in a bewildered daze. 

He staggered from the water and 
fell to his knees on the sand. He 
crawled toward her with savage 
deliberation in the moonlight*

brittle shat-

her face. He hit her again and 
again, rblling across the sand, bat- 
tering her face until his fists were 
driving into wet pulp. 

“My eyes! My eyes!" 

Weakly he crouched over her, 
staring. She had been wearing con- 
tact lenses. The green irises had 
been stained on the glass to cover 
her gray ones. Now jagged slivers 
of glass protruded from under her 
eyelids. She rolled her head and 
moaned, trying to escape him.

drove as straight as his failing sight

Earth and ndt on Venus, either. 
You think there’s a pied -piper or 
something which calls all the ani- 
mals away?” 

"Maybe. I don’t know much 
about those things.” 

“No. I don’t think they went any- 
place. They’re just quiet. They 
didn’t come' out of their holes or 
hovels or down from the trees. But 
why ?” 

“Well, let’s forget it. Let’s go 
back to camp. We can try again 
tomor — look! Look, there’s some- 
thing!” 

Judd followed her pointing fin- 
ger with his eyes. Half-hidden by 
the creepers and vines clinging to 
an old ' tree-stump, something was 
watching them. It wasn’t very big 
and it seemed in no hurry to get 
away. 

“What is it?” Lindy wanted to 

know. 

“Don’t know. Never saw any- 
thing like it before. Venus is still 
an unknown frontier; the books 
only name a couple dozen of the 
biggest animals. But hell, Lindy, 
that’s not game. I don’t think it 
weighs five pounds.” 

“It’s cute, and it has a lovely 
skin.” 

Judd couldn’t argue with that. 
Squatting on its haunches, the crea- 
ture was about twenty inches tall. 
It had a pointed snout and two 
thin, long ears. Its eyes were very 
big and very round and quite black. 
They looked something like the eyes 
of an Earth! an tarsier, hut the tar- 
sier were bloody little beasts. The 



MILTON LESSER 

skin was short and stiff and was a 

ft 

kind of silvery white. Under the 
sheen, however,^ it seemed to glow. 
A diamond is colorless, Judd 
thought, but "when you see it under 
light a whole rainbow of colors 
sparkle deep within it. This crea- 
ture’s skin was like that, Judd de- 
cided. 

“If we could get enough of 
them,” Lindy was saving, “Fd have 
the most unusual coat! Do you 
think we could find enough, Judd?” 
“I doubt it. Never saw anything 
like it before, never heard of any- 
thing like it. You’d need fifty of 
’em, anyway. Let’s forget about it — 
too small to shoot, anyway.” 

“No, Judd. I want it.” 

“Well, I’m not going to stalk a 
five-pound — hey, wait a minute! I 
taught you how to use this rifle, so 
why don’t you bag it?” 

Lindy grinned. “That’s a fine 
idea. I was a little scared of some of 
those big lizards and cats and every- 
thing, but now I’m going to take 
you up on it. Here, give me your 
gun.” 

Judd removed the leather thong 
from his shoulder and handed the 
weapon to her. She looked at it a 
little uncertainly, then took the clip 
of shells which Judd offered and 
slammed it into the chamber. The 
little creature sat unmoving. 

“Isn’t it peculiar that it doesn’t 
run away, Judd?” 

“Sure is. Nothing formidable 
about that animal, so unless it has 
a hidden poison somewhere, just 
about anything in this swamp could 
do it in. To survive it would have to 
be fast as hell and it would have 
to keep running all the time. Beats 



me, Lindy ” 

“Well, Tm going to get myself 
one pelt toward that coat, anyway. 
Watch, Judd: is this the way?” She 
lifted the rifle to her shoulder and 
squinted down the sights toward 
the shining creature. 

“Yeah, that’s the way. Only re- 
lax. Relax. Shoulder’s so tense 
you’re liable to dislocate it with the 
kick. There — that’s better.” 

Now Lindy’s finger was wrapped 
around the trigger and she remem- 
bered Judd had told her to squeeze 
it, not to pull it. If you pulled the 
trigger you jerked the rifle and 
spoiled your aim. You had to 
squeeze it slowly . 

The animal seemed politely in- 
terested. 

Suddenly, a delicious languor 
stole over Lindy. It possessed her 
all at once and she had no idea 
where it came from. Her legs had 
been stiff and tired from the all- 
morning trek through the swamp, 
but now they felt fine. Her whole 
body was suffused in a warm, satis- 
fied glow of well-being. And lazi- 
ness. It was an utterly new sensa- 
tion and she could even feel it 
tingling even at the roots of her 
hair. She sighed and lowered the 
rifle. 

“I don't want to shoot it,” she 
said. 

“You just told me you did.” 

“I know, but I changed my mind. 
What’s the matter, can’t I change 
my mind?” 

“Of course you can change your 
mind. But I thought you wanted a 
coat of those things.” 

“Yes, I suppose I do. But I don’t 
want to shoot it, that’s all,” 




Judd snorted. “I think you have 
a streak of softness someplace in 
that pretty head of yours!” 

“Maybe. I don’t know. But I’d 
still like the pelt. Funny, isn’t it?” 
“Okay, okay! But don’t ask to 
use the gun again.” Judd snatched 
it from her hands. “If you don’t 
want to shoot it, then I will 
we can make you a pair of 
or something from the pelt.” 

And Judd pointed his ancient 
rifles at the little animal pre- 
paring to snap off a quick shot. 
It would be a cinch at this distance. 
Even Lindy wouldn’t have missed, 
if she hadn’t changed her mind. 

Judd yawned. He’d failed to 
realize he was so tired. Not an ach- 
ing kind of tiredness, but the kind 
that makes you feel good all over. 
He yawned again and lowered the 
rifle. “Changed my mind,” he said. 
“I don’t want to shoot it, either. 
What say we head back for camp?” 
Lindy gripped his hand impul- 
sively. “All right, Judd — but I had 
a brainstorm! I want it for a pet!” 
“A pet?” 

“Yes. I think it would be the 
cutest thing. Everyone would look 
and wonder and I’ll adore it!” 




“We don’t know anythin! 
it. Maybe Earth would be too cold, 
or too dry, or maybe we don’t have 
anything it can eat. There are liable 
to be a hundred different strains of 
bacteria that can kill it.” 

“I said I want it for a pet. See? 
Look at it! We can call it

Black Eyes — ” Judd groaned. 
Yes, Black Eyes. If you don’t do 
this one thing for me, Judd — ” ,

to do any tiling. You want it, you 
take it.” 

Lindy frowned, looked at him 
crossly, then sloshed across the 
swamp toward Black Eyes. The 
creature waited on its stump until 
she came quite close, and then, with 
a playful little bound, it hopped 
onto her shoulder, still squatting on 
its haunches. Lindy squealed ex- 
citedly and began to stroke its sil- 
very fur. 

A MONTH LATER, they returned 
to Earth, Judd and Lindy and 
Black Eyes. The hunting trip had 
been a success — Judd’s trophies 
were on their way home on a slow’ 
freighter, and he'd have some hne 
heads and skins for his study-room. 
Even Black Eyes had been no trou- 
ble at all. It ate scraps from their 
table, forever sitting on its haunches 
and staring at them with its big 
black eyes. Judd thought it would 
make one helluva lousy pet, but he 
didn’t tell Lindy. Trouble was, it 
never did anything. It merely sat 
still, or occasionally it would 
bounce down to the floor and mince 
along on its hind-legs for a scrap 
of food. It never uttered a sound. It 
did not frolic and it did not gam- 
bol. Most of the time it could have 
been carved from stone. But Lindy 
was happy and Judd said nothing. 

They had a little trouble with the 
customs officials. This because noth- 
ing unknown could be brought to 
Earth without a thorough examina- 
tion. 

At the customs office, a be- 
spectacled official stared at Black 
Eyes, scratching his head. “Never 



seen one like that before/’ 

“Neither have I,” Judd admitted. 

“Well, I’ll look in the book.” The 
man did, but there are no thorough 
tomes on Venusian fauna. “Not 
here.” 

“I could have told you.” 

“Well, we’ll have to quarantine 
it and study it. That means .you 
and your wife go into quarantine, 
too. It could have something that’s 
catching.” 

“Absurd!” Lindy cried. 

“Sorry, lady. I only work here.” 

“You and your bright ideas,” 
Judd told his wife acidly. “We may 
be quarantined a month until they 
satisfy themselves about Black 
Eyes.” 

The customs official shrugged Ms 
bony shoulders; and Judd removed 
a twenty credit note from his pocket 
and handed it to the man. “Will 
this change your mind?” 

“I should say not! You can’t 
bribe me, Mr. Whitney! You 
can’t — ” The man yawned, 
stretched languidly, smiled. “No sir, 
you can keep your money, Mr. 
Whitney. Guess we don’t have to 
examine your pet after all. Mighty 
cute little feller. Well, have fun 
with it. Come on, move along now.” 
And, as they were departing with 
Black Eyes, still not believing their 

ears: “Darn this weather! Makes a 
man so lazy. 

It was after the affair at the 
customs office, that Black Eyes ut- 
tered its first sound. City life hasn’t 
changed much in the last fifty years. 
Jet-cars still streak around the cir- 
cumferential highways, their whis- 
tles blaring. Factories still belch 
smoke and steam, although the new

atomic power plants have lessened 
that to a certain extent. Crowds 
still throng the streets, noisy, hurry- 
ing, ill-mannered. Ids one of those 
things that can't be helped, A city 
has to live, and it has to make noise. 

But it seemed to frighten Lindy’s 
new pet. It stared through the jet- 
car window on the way from the 
spaceport to the Whitney’s subur- 
ban home, its black eyes welling 
with tears. 

“Look!” Judd exclaimed. “Black 
Eyes can cry!” 

“A crying pet, Judd. I knew 
there would be something unusual 
about Black Eyes, I just knew it!” 

The tears in the big black eyes 
overflowed and tumbled out, roll- 
ing down Black Eyes’ silvery cheeks. 
And then Black Eyes whimpered. It 
was only a brief whimper, but both 
Judd and Lindy heard it, and even 
the driver turned around for a mo- 
ment and stared at the animal. 

The driver stopped the jet. He 
yawned and rested his head com- 
fortably on the cushioned seat. He 
went quietly to sleep. 

A MAN NAMED Merry winkle 
owned the Merrywinkle Shipping 
Service. That, in itself, was not un- 
usual. But at precisely the moment 
that Black Eyes unleashed its mild 
whimper, Mr. Merrywinkle — up- 
town and five miles away— called 
an emergency conference of the 
board of directors and declared: 
“Gentlemen, we have all been 
working too hard, and I, for one, 
am going to take a vacation. I don’t 

know when I’ll be back, but it 

* 

won’t be before six months;” 



“But someone protested. 

“There’s the Parker deal and the 
Gilette contract and a dozen other 
things. You’re needed!” 

Mr. Merrywinkle shook his bald 
head. “What’s more, you’re all tak- 
ing vacations, with pay. Six 
months, each of you. We’re closing 
down Merrywinkle Shipping for 
half a year. Give the competition a 
break, eh?” 

“But C.M.! We’re about ready 
to squeeze out Chambers Parcel 
Co.! They’ll get back on their feet 
in six months.” 

“Never mind. Notify all depart- 
ments of the shut-down, effective 
immediately. Vacations for all.’ 3 

W HO SHUT off the assembly 
belt?” the foreman asked mild- 
ly. He was not a mild man and he 
usually stormed and ranted at the 
slightest provocation. This was at 
Clewson Jctcraft, and you couldn’t 
produce a single jet-plane without 
the assembly belt, naturally. 

A plump little man said, “I did.” 
“But why?” the foreman asked 
him, smiling blandly. 

“I don’t know. I just did.” 

The foreman was still smiling. “I 
don’t blame you.” 

Two days later, Clewson Jet- 
craft had to lay off all its help. 
They put ads in all the papers seek- 
ing new personnel but no one 
showed up. Clewson was forced to 
shut down.

B LACK EYES whimpered again 
when Judd and Lindy reached 
home but after that it was quiet. It 
just sat on its haunches near the 
window and stared out at the city. 
The quiet city. 

Nothing moved in the streets. 
Nothing stirred. People remained 
at home watching local video or 
the new space-video from Mars. At 
first it was a good joke, and the 
newspapers could have had a field 
day with it, had the newspapers re- 
mained in circulation. After four 
days, however, they suspended pub- 
lication. On the fifth day, there was 
a shortage of food in the city, great 
stores of it spoiling in the ware- 
houses. Heat and light failed after 
a week, and the fire department ig- 
nored all alarms a day later. 

But everything did not stop. 
School teachers still taught their 
classes; clerks still sold whatever 
goods were left on local shelves. 
Librarians were still at their desks. 

Conservatives said it was a 
liberal plot to undermine capital 
and demand higher wages; liberals 



MILTON LESSER 

said big business could afford the 
temporary layoff and wanted to 
squeeze out the small businessman 
and labor unions. 

Scientists pondered and city offi- 
cials made speeches over video. 

“Something,” one of them ob- 
served, “has hit our city. Work that 
requires anything above a modicum 
of sound has become impossible; in 
regards to such work people have 
become lazy. No one can offer any 

valid suggestions concerning the 
malady. It merely exists. However, 
if a stop is not put to it — and soon 
— our fair city will disintegrate. 
Something is making us lazy, and 
that laziness can spell doom, being 
a compulsive lack of desire to create 
any noise or disturbance. If anyone 
believes he has the solution, he • 
should contact the Department of 
Science at once. If you can’t use 
the video-phone, come in person. 
But come! Every hour which passes 
adds to the city’s woes.” 

' Nothing but scatter-brained ideas 
for a week, none of them worth 
consideration. Then the bespec- 
tacled custom’s official who had by- 
passed quarantine for Black Eyes, 
got in touch with the authorities. 
He had always been a conscientious 
man — except for that one lapse. 
Maybe the queer little beast had 
nothing to do with this crisis. But 
then again, the custom’s official 
had never before — or since — had .. 
that strange feeling of lassitude. 
Could there be some connection? 

A staff of experts on extra-ter- 
restrial fauna was dispatched to the 
Whitney residence, although, in- 
deed, the chairman of the Depart- 
ment of Science secretly considered 



BLACK EYES and the DAILY GRIND 



83 



the whole idea ridiculous. 

The staff of experts introduced 
themselves. Then, ignoring the 
protests of Lindy, went to work on 
Black Eyes. At first Judd thought 
the animal would object, but ap- 
parently it did not. While condi- 
tions all about’ them in the city 
worsened, the experts spent three 
days studying Black Eyes. 

They found nothing out of the 
ordinary. 

Black Eyes merely stared back at 
them, and but for an accident, they 
would have departed without a 
lead. On the third day, a huge 
mongrel dog which belonged to 
the Whitney’s next-door neighbors 
somehow slipped its leash. It was a 
fierce and ugly animal, and it was 
known to attack anything smaller 
than itself. It jumped the fence and 
landed in Judd Whitney’s yard. A 
few loping bounds took it through 
an open window, ground level. In- 
side, it spied Black Eyes and made 
for the creature at once, howling 
furiously. 

Black Eyes didn’t budge. 

And the mongrel changed its 
mind! The slavering tongue with- 
drew inside the chops, the howling 
stopped. The mongrel lay down on 
the floor and whined. Presently it 
lost all interest, got to its feet, and 
left as it had come. 

Other animals were brought to 
the Whitney home. Cats. Dogs. A 
lion from the city zoo, starved for 
two days and brought in a special 
mobile cage by its keeper. Black 
Eyes was thrust into the cage and 
the lion gave forth with a hideous 
yowling. Soon it stopped, rolled 
over, and slept. 



T HE SCIENTISTS correlated 

their reports, returned with them 
to the Whitney house. The leader, 
whose name was Jamison, said: 
“As closely as we can tell, Black 
Eyes is the culprit.” 

“What?” Lindy demanded. 

“Yes, Mrs. Whitney. Your pet, 
Black Eyes.” 

“Oh, I don’t believe it!” 

But Judd said, “Go ahead, Dr. 
Jamison. I’m listening.” 

“Well, how does an animal — any 
animal — protect itself?” 

“Why, in any number of ways. If 
it has claws or a strong jaw and 
long teeth, it can fight. If it is fleet 
of foot, it can run. If it is big and 
has a tough hide, most other ani- 
mals can’t hurt it anyway. Umm- 
mm, doesn’t that about cover it?” 
“You left out protective colora- 
tion, defensive odors, and things 
like that. Actually, those are most 
important from our point of view, 
for Black Eyes’ ability is a further 
-ramification of that sort of thing. 
Your pet is not fast. It isn’t strong. 
It can’t change color and it has no 
offensive odor to chase off preda- 
tory enemies. It has no armor. In 
short, can you think of a more help- 
less creature to put down in those 
Venusian swamps?” 

After Judd had shaken his head, 
Dr. Jamison continued: “Very 

well, Black Eyes should not be able 
to survive on Venus — and 1 yet, ob- 
viously the creature did. We can 
assume there are more of the breed, 
too. Anyway, Black Eyes survives. 
And I’ll tell you why. 

“Black Eyes has a very uncom- 
mon ability to sense danger when 
it approaches. And sensing danger,

Black Eyes can thwart it. Your 
creature sends out certain emana- 
tions — I won’t pretend to know 
what they are — which stamp ag- 
gression out of any predatory- crea- 
tures. Neither of you could fire 
upon it — right?” 

“Urnm-mm, that’s true/* Judd 
said. 

Lindy nodded. 

“Well, that’s one half of it. 
There’s so much about life we don’t 
understand. Black Eyes uses energy 
of an unknown intensity, and the 
result maintains Black Eyes’ life. 
Nov/, although that is the case, 
your animal did not live a com- 
fortable life in the Venusian 
swamp. Because no animal would 
attack it, it could not be harmed. 
Still, from what you tell me about 
that swamp. 

i ‘"Anyhow. Black Eyes was glad 
to come away with you, and every- 
thing went well until you landed in 
New York. The noises, the clatter- 
ing, the continual bustle of a great 
city — all this frightened the crea- 
ture. It was being attacked— or, at 
least that’s what it must have fig- 
ured. Result: it struck back the 
only way it knew how. Have you 
ever heard about sub-sonic sound- 
waves, Mr. Whitney, waves of 
sound so low that our ears cannot 
pick them up — waves of sound 
which can nevertheless stir our 
emotions? Such things exist, and, as 
a working hypothesis, I would say 
Black Eyes’ strange powers rest 
along those lines. The whole city 
is idle because Black Eyes is 
afraid!” 

In his exploration of Mars, of 
Venus, of the Jovian Moons— Judd

Whitney had seen enough of extra- 
terrestrial life to know that virtually 
anything was possible, and Black 
Eyes would be no exception to that 
rule. 



“What do you propose to do?” 
Judd demanded. 

“Do? Why, we’ll have to kill your 

creature, naturallv. You can set a 

* «* 

value on it and we will meet it, but 
Black Eyes must die.” 

“No!” Lindy cried. “You can’t 
be sure, you’re only guessing, and 
it isn’t fair!” 

“My dear woman, don’t you 
realize this is a serious situation? 
The city’s people will starve in 
time, No one can even bring food 
in because the trucks make too 
much noise! As an alternative, we 
could evacuate, but is your pet 
more valuable than the life of a 
great city?” 

itJsJ 3 * 

In - no. 



“Then, please! Listen to reason!” 
“Kill it,” Judd said. “Go ahead.” 
Dr. Jamison withdrew from his 
pocket a small blasting pistol used 
by the Department of Domestic 
Animals for elimination of injured 
creatures. He advanced on Black 
Eyes, who sat on its haunches in the 
center of the room, surveying the 
scientist. ' : ■* : 

Dr. Jamison put his blaster away. 
“I can’t/’ he said. “I don’t want 
to.” 

Judd smiled. “I know it. No one 
— no thing — can kill Black Eyes. 
You said so yourself. It was a waste 
of time to try it. In that case—--” 
“In that case/’ Dr. Jamison fin-

thing. Wait a minute— does it sleep, 
Mr. Whitney?” 

“I don’t think so. At least, I 
never saw it sleep. And your team 
of scientists, did they report any- 
thing?” 

“No. As far as they could see, the 
creature never slept. We can't catch 
it unawares.” 

“Could you anesthetize it?” 
“How? It can sense danger, and 
long before you could do that, it 
would stop you. It’s only made one 
mistake, Mr. Whitney: it believes 
the noises of the city represent a 
danger. And that’s only a negative 
mistake. Noise won’t hurt Black 
Eyes, of course. It simply makes the 
animal unnecessarily cautious. But 
we cannot anesthetize it any more 
than we can kill it;” 

“I could take it back to Venus.” 
“Could you? Could you? I 
hadnH thought of that.” 

Judd shook his head. “I can’t.” 
“What do you mean you can’t?” 
“It won’t let me. Somehow it can 
sense our thoughts when we think 
something it doesn’t want. I can’t 
take it to Venus! No man could, be- 
cause it doesn’t want to go.” 

“My dear Mr. Whitney — do you 
mean to say you believe it can 

think r* 

“Uh-uh. Didn’t say that. It can 
sense our thoughts, and that’s 
something else again.” 

Dr. Jamison threw his hands up 
over his head in a dramatic gesture. 
“It’s hopeless.” he said. 

T HINGS GREW worse. New 
York crawled along to a stand- 
still People began to move from 



the city. In trickles, at first, but the 
trickles became torrents, as New 
York’s ten million people began to 
depart for saner places. It might 
take months — it” might even take 
years, but the exodus had begun. 
Nothing could stop it. Because of a 
harmless little beast with the eyes 
of a tarsier. the life of a great city 
was coming to an end. 

Word spread. Scientists all over 
the world studied reports on Black 
Eyes. No one had any ideas. Every- 
one was stumped. Black Eyes had 
no particular desire to go outside. 
Black Eyes merely remained in the 
Whitney house, contemplating 
nothing in particular, and stopping 
everything. 

Dr. Jamison, however, was a per- 
sistent man. Judd got a letter from 
him one day, and the following 
afternoon he kept his appointment 
with the scientist 

“It’s good to get out,” Judd said, 
after a three hour walk to the De- 
partment of Science Building. “I 
can go crazy just staring at that 
thing.” i 

“I have it, Whitney.” 

'‘You have what? Not the way to 
destroy Black Eyes? I don’t believe 
it!” 

“It’s true. Consider. Everyone in 
the world does not yet know' of your 
pet, correct?” * . 

“I suppose there are a few people 
who don’t — ” • 

“There are many. Among them, 
are the crew of a jet-bomber which 
has been on maneuvers in Egypt. 
We have arranged everything.” 

“Yes? How?” ‘

behind us.” 

“Yeah” Judd said. “Yeah.” But 
somehow, the scientist had failed to 
instill any of his confidence in 
Judd.

big town newspapers. Like the rest, 
I had a vague idea of what it was

started. What kind of things? Well, 

up to that line, things were normal ; 
but beyond it, grass got enormous, 
the ground was higher and softer. 
Trees forgot to shed their leaves. 
Animals flocked there to eat the 
lush grass, so the Prof erected a 
ten-foot electrified fence around 
his land to keep out the hordes of 
rabbits, deer, mice and what have 
you that came to feast off the new 
supply of better forage. 

That was only the beginning. 
Some months later there came 
items about houseflies the size of 
walnuts hatching out around the 
Profs retreat. Now a swarm of 
houseflies the size of walnuts is 
news, and Jake and I got up there 
on the jump. 

It was terrific! The flies were 
there all right, but so were a good 
many other oversized creatures. 
Roosting in the trees were robins, 
bluebirds, and doves as large as 
turkeys. King-sized ducks wad- 
dled about importantly, displaying 
pouter-pigeon crops from overeat- 
ing. It was as if some god had 
drawn a line and said : '‘This is the 
new Eden, where all living tilings 
will prosper terrifically.” 

You never saw a sight like it! 
Or did you? Were you one of the 
horde who started camping around 
the Profs magic circle trying to get 
permission to enter? 

It was then we got proof that it 
pays to be kind. Of all the news- 
grabbers who surrounded the Profs 
big wire gate, Jake and I were the 
only ones who got in. The old man 
had not forgotten who had taken 
him seriously and who had made 
fun of him. 



91 

Jake snapped a series of startling 
pics of the oversized animals and 
birds. I interviewed the Prof again, 
even got his maid, Tilda’s opinions, 
and wrote it up as unsensationally 
as possible, playing down the tre- 
mendous potential for trouble, 
placing up the really effective 
method the old scientist had discov- 
ered for “eliminating the deteriora- 
tion factor” in life. 1 could see 
where the world was in for some 
changes, and the going was going 
to be rough enough for the old man 
without making it worse. But my 
efforts came to naught when the 
pics Jake had taken reached the 
editor’s desk. He hit the ceiling, 
called me on the carpet, wanted to 
know where my news sense had 
gotten lost. Then he sent out three 
other smart boys to do a good job 
on it. 

The paper got out a special edi- 
tion — and the troubles I had fore- 
seen began. First, the government 
stepped in, trying to hush-hush the 
whole thing; but too late. The rush 
had started. For miles around the 
poor Prof’s fenced-in hideaway, 
cars and trailers parked in a mad 
sensejess jumble. People crowded 
against the fences and the elec- 
tricity had to be shut off. Some 
smart aleck produced wire cutters 
and made an opening. The in- 
vasion of the new Eden had begun. 

Stegner took flight, taking his se- 
cret apparatus and files with him. 
He declined police escort, and van- 
ished from his mad Eden. Where 
he went was impossible to learn, 
but I supposed the government 
knew. 

The area he had revitalized with

a lush immortality, and he had 
been shoved aside and pawed over 
and written about like some fredc. 
If .he had been a notorious criminal, 
he would have gotten far better 
journalistic treatment. 

But the years went by — four, five 
of them. And nothing more was 
heard of Stegner and his work. Un- 
til, one day coming home from a 
night shifttbn the paper, I found a 
letter in my box. It was a rather 
plain looking envelope, but much 
sr than the ordinary. The

“Why not just explain it to these 
men?” 

He laughed bitterly. “They wish 
to use their gigantic size to con- 
quer the world. They can do it, too. 
Their minds have increased in 
power. Growth is that way. But 
moral values are something differ- 
ent- — they are acquired by experi- 
ence. Find some moral men who 
might use this information to cir- 
cumvent what is about to happen.” 

I took the papers and shook his 
gigantic hand. I left via the back 
door, and sneaked through a clump 
of giant ferns to the edge of the air- 
field. A little prowling revealed a 
parked plane, long unused because 
those who had flown it here had 
grown too big to use it. I waited, 
hidden in the lush greenery until 
the setting sun would hide my 
movements. It would only be a few 
minutes now. 

The hangar in which the plane 
was parked contained several gaso- 
line drums, the kind with pumps on 
them that worked with a crank. I 
got into the hangar, finally, and be- 
fore it got too dark to see, checked 
the plane’s gas gauge. It was about 
a quarter full. I connected the gas 
hose and started pumping. In 
twenty minutes I had her full, then 
I climbed into the plane. 

When the motor caught, after I 
was sure it never would, the thun- 
der of the prop brought giants run- 
ning toward me from the far end 
of the field, their twenty-foot 
strides eating up the distance. But 
I taxied straight toward them, giv- 
ing the plane’s motors all they 



would take. The plane roared down 
the field, and they fell flat as the 
prop came at them. The plane 
lifted, spun over them, was off. 
Now slugs from oversize rifles came 
buzzing about me, crashing through 
the fuselage. But it was dark and 
I was away. No serious damage had 
been done. 

In Texas it took me four hours to 
get the brass to listen to me. Finally 
they did. They didn’t ask me to 
keep my mouth shut. They just 
turned me loose. I went to my edi- 
tor and told him the truth. He 
didn’t believe me. When he checked 
with the army, they said I was ob- 
viously trying to perpetrate a hoax. 
I nearly got fired. 

ONTHS went by, and I 
waited. I knew I’d have to 
wait until my chance came. 
There’ d have to be hellfire before 
anybody’d believe my story. Then 
the storm broke, in sensational 
headlines. “Gigantic beasts wipe 
out town in South America.” 

My editor sent for me. He 
showed me the headline. “Maybe 
I made a mistake not believing 
your story about Stegner,” he said. 
“I make a lot of mistakes.” 

“You want me to cover this?” I 
said. v 

“That’s it. And if you can come 
up with proof of what you told- me 
when you got back from that crazy 
trip, I’ll print every damned word.” 

W HEN I GOT on the scene, 

I knew they were at last 
taking it seriously. The locals had

called out the army to fight the 
strange monsters that were coming 
out of the jungle. They were such 
things as army ants six feet long; 
anteaters looking like ambling loco- 
motives with hairy hides and 
noses; lumbering sloths vast as a 
houses on legs, sleepy and comic as 
ever, but terrifyingly destructive; 
jaguars like trucks and trailers; 
centipedes with stingers over their 
backs that would reach a man in a 
third-story’ window; wasps and bees 
like buzzards. The army was lash- 
ing at. these things with machine 
guns, flame throwers, tanks and 
rockets. Jeeps careened across the 
landscape with loads of ammo. It 
was a madhouse on a vast scale, 
and being fought to the death. 
They waited for the beasts to come 
out of the jungle, then they jumped 
them — or were jumped. Nobody 
was allowed to fly into the hinter- 
land to see where they were com- 
ing from. And when I tried to get 
officials to consider it, they abso- 
lutely refused. Up there, it was 
hinted, were secret government 
projects — besides they were too far 
away — and radio said there was no 
sign of anything unusual there. It 
was worth even a general’s job to 
poke his nose in near those projects. 
And how could I tell these people 
traitorous men of their own gov- 
ernment were the culprits? It just 
wasn’t possible — and because I had 
to stay on the scene, I never even 
hinted it. I merely waited my 
chance to produce proof. I knew 
I’d get it, sooner or later. Some- 
thing would come out of that jun- 
gle I’d be able to use to convey the 
real menace to the knowledge of 



a puzzled world. 

I wrote carefully, reporting the 
weird war with the animal world — 
and I kept inserting paragraphs 
hinting about Stcgner and his 
growth field, adding “rumors” that 
maybe his work had been taken 
over by a power-mad clique and it 
was they who were loosing this 
horror. 

My • boss liked the stuff I was 
putting in, because it sold papers, 
and 1 was careful to keep my facts 
separate, and label my theories. 
Nobody — at least so it seemed — 
believed the theories, but they 
made good reading. I got a raise in 
salary. 

Other reporters were knocking 
out stories as good as mine, but 
without the insight into the facts 
that 1 had. So their stories went too 
far afield. Mine became popular, 
and were in demand as reprints all 
over the world. But officially, no- 
body paid any attention to me, so 
the important papers nestled the 
bottom of my trunk. 1 didn’t want 
them confiscated until the time 
came when I could publish them 
with proof. My boss would back me 
up when that proof came. I was 
sure of that. 

I got my chance the day the 
giantess came crashing out of the 
smoke and dust of the circle of 
horror across which the beasts were 
constantly lunging. She was near 
naked, and half mad with pain 
from the giant insects plaquing her. 
No one fired on her as she stood 
with uplifted arms, waiting for the 
soldiers to kill her as she expected. 
Beautiful as a goddess out of an an- 
cient myth she came forward to- 




96 



ward the soldiers, her face lighting 

with hope, her hair streaming 
golden in the sun. She spoke to us 
then, and the silence that came 
over the field of carnage was com- 

“Look at me! Look at me and 
believe! There are others like me, 
back in the jungle; mad giants who 
plan to conquer your world. They 
are ready to do it. I have escaped 
to warn you. They are mad, these 
giants my master has created. They 
are monsters. .” 

I recognized her now. My senses 
leaped and my blood pounded in 
my veins. Here was my opportunity 
to convince the world. This was 
Tilda, Stegner* s maid! I snapped 
several pictures of her as she went 
on talking. 

“These men, who were once 
your own leaders are plotting to 
destroy you and take the world for 
themselves. You do not know what 
they are preparing for you, but I 
come to tell you. Make ready, for 
they arc on their way to destroy 
you. They bring huge guns, mon- 
ster tanks that they have built, ma- 
chines never before seen on 
earth.” 

What more she might have told 
we were never to know, for she fell 
then, at the end of her strength. 
Whatever she had dared, whatever 
she had gone through to break out 
of that monstrous circle and come 
to us, had been too much even 
for her giant’s strength. She fell, 
like a tower crashing down, and 
lay there, a great lax pile of pink 
and red flesh, torn by thorns, the 
claws of animals, the stingers of 
terrible giant insects. 



RICHARD S. SHAVER 

Then the monsters came again, 
and we could not go to her. She 
lay there as darkness came, and in 
the morning only her skeleton re- 
mained. stripped of flesh in the 
night by the myriad devouring 
giant ants and beetles. 

V 

M Y STORY went in, with 

photos of Tilda. My editor 
printed the whole story, printed my 
formulae, printed every word of 
the history of Stegner and his crea- 
tions, and the secret menace he had 
unwittingly loosed on the world 
from his second hidden Eden in 
the jungle. I was called home. 

They came to me then, those 
moral ones Stegner had said ex- 
isted. Men high in government 
and army circles who had the 
peace and welfare of the world at 
heart. Selfless ones whose records 
were above reproach. And they 
proved to be high in the powers of 
the world, able to command. 

I WENT back to South America, 

to my reporting. I wanted to 
be on hand when the attack of 
which Tilda had warned became 
reality. 

I was some twelve miles from the 
deadly circle when the giant tanks 
appeared. They were larger than 
any moving thing ever seen on 
Earth before. Tracklayers, caterpil- 
lars — and swinging above them 
slender towers which bore ominous 
gleaming nozzles. On they came. 

Then they struck at us. From the 
nozzles a cold brilliance leaped out, 
unnameable, that swept forward 





97 



OF STEGNER'S FOLLY 



like a slow lightning, a kind of 
crackling sheet of cold fire that 
spread from tower to tower, in an 
arc that began to bend toward our 
lines. 

The fire came in mile-wide 
swaths. There was no outcry, no 
terror — just the sweating lines of 
men in foxholes, the crews about 
the guns, heaving ammo into their 
maws; the rumbling trucks and the 
careening jeeps. The fire swept 
over all like liquid radiance, like a 
pouring out of moonlight, soft but 
brilliant, mild yet deadly. Then it 
was gone. And when it had gone, 
nothing but silence remained. 
Dead men stretched out where they 
* had lain waiting, fallen where 
they labored ; jeeps careened on to 
crash into, stumps or bigger trucks 
—and stop forever, Only silence 
and death and nothingness was left. 

When the silence swept across 
the whole front I dropped my 
glasses and lit out for my own car, 
and headed for the coast. I wanted 
to file this story in person, and I 
knew, too, that army would not be 
there in the morning. I meant to 
stay alive. I knew that the hope for 
mankind lay in what honest men 
were doing with Stegner’s formu- 
lae. 1 had to know. So I fled. 

Next day they were dropping 
atom bombs on every moving thing 
in Stegncr's ghastly Eden. High fly- 
ing bombers flew in swarms — and 
many of them were being shot 
down by the weird fire. I saw those 
atom bombs falling, on television, 
and the white radiance reaching up 
toward them. I saw' it catch them 
in its embrace, saw them explode 
harmlessly in the air, midway in 



in their plunge. Whatever the fire 
was, it was a defense against the 
atom bomb, for it exploded them 
before they could reach their 
targets. • 

It didn't catch them all, and it 
didn’t intercept all the high-flying 
bombers loosing their guided rocket 
missiles. It got enough though, to 
show us we were on the losing 
end. What we needed was a mir- 
acle. And the miracle did occur. 

At first, even with my fingers on 
every tag end of information that 
came out of the terrible area, it was 
an unnoticeable change. Then I 
got it. The men doing our fighting 
changed in caliber and ability. I 
never learned, due to the official 
habit of hushing everything up, 
just whose technology accom- 
plished the miracle, but it must 
have been started from the first, 
with those army officers who had 
listened to me with such lack of 
interest when I spoke before their 
inquisition at the Texas army air 
field. 

All I learned was that there was 
a new kind of man busy at the 
front, a man of keener intellect, 
swifter of action, infinitely more 
able than the former ordinary sol- 
dier. 

It was Jake who first confirmed 
my suspicions. He brought in pho- 
tographs of men lifting trucks out 
of mudholes, men tearing steel 
cables apart with their bare hands, 
men jumping over twenty-foot bar- 
riers with full pack. “Whatta I do 
with that kind of pic? The people 
are so fed up with the impossible 
news they are getting that they 
don’t believe anything any more!

RICHARD S. SHAVER 



But you and I know a news camera 
doesn't lie . it doesn’t have' 

time!” 

They had put the Profs formu- 
lae to work against the giants. This 
time it was the right formulae. 
They had growth without increase 
in size, a growth of ability, of 
strength, of mentality, without any 
increase in ponderous structure. 
These new soldiers were the police- 
men of the United Nations made 
into supermen! 

I began to believe in the human 
race again. “Great!” I said. “This 
is^what I’ve been waiting for!” 

Jake tossed me his pictures and 
went away. I turned to the type- 
writer and began batting out my 
story: “Mankind solves the prob- 
lem of giantism! The new weapon 
against the giants is — the new 
man!” 

Those little giants waded into 
that circle through all the deadly 
fire and the giant scorpions and 
vast beasts like Jack-the-Giant- 
Killer’s multitudinous sons — and it 



wasn’t a month later that I typed 
the last story of my life and gave 
up reporting for good. It was the 
tale of the death of the last giant— 
and Jake’s picture of him, armed 
in the end with only his fists, huge 
as a tree, mad with hunger and 
thirst and terrible fear of the little 
men who were just as mighty, a lot 
quicker, and every bit as smart as 
any giant. They routed him out 
with tear gas and shot him down 
with plain old GI rifle fire. 

Yes, I gave up newspaper work. 
Why? They offered me a job mak- 
ing a movie out of the “War of the 
Giants”. The job gave me quick 
money, which is what I needed. * 
The wife and I are starting a new 
colony on Malino Island. It’s in the 
Carelinas. We’re going to try this 
growth-without-size business out 
properly. 

Yes, that’ s my son. Eight months. 
He doesn’t ordinarily go around 
dragging a piano — it just got in his 
way. •

ing the marmalade, “but

The whole thing made me quite

was delighted.” 

Meticulously Dr. Lefferts closed 
the newly-arrived Journal of the

it cm the copy of Strength of Ma-

Lucinda laughed good-humored-

“He did not,” said Lucinda. “He 
shook a big thick forefinger at her 
as if she were a naughty but be- 
loved child, and the push-button 
blarney that oozed out of him was 
as easy to see as the wink he gave 
her. That’s what made me mad.” 
“And well it should.” He folded 
his napkin. “Violations of the law 
should be immediately pun — ” 

“The law had little to do with 
it” Lucinda said warmly. “I was 
angry because I know what would 
have happened to you or to me in 
that same situation. We’re- just not 
equipped.” 

“I begin to see.” He put his 
pince-nez back on and peered at 
her. “And what was it that de- 
lighted you?” 

She stretched easily and half- 
closed her eyes. “The — what you 
have called the femaleness of it. 
It’s good to be a woman, darling, 
and to watch another woman be 
female skillfully.” 

“I quarrel with your use of the 
term ‘skillfully,’ ” he said, folding 
his napkin. “Her ‘skill’ is analogous 
to an odor of musk or other such 
exudation in the lower animals.” 
“It is not/* she said flatly. “With 
the lower animals, bait of that kind 
means one thing and one thing 
only, complete and final. With a 
woman, it means nothing- of the 
kind. Never mind what it might 
mean; consider what it does mean. 
Do you think for a moment that 
the blonde in the convertible was 
making herself available to the po- 
liceman?” 

“She was hypothesizing a situa- 
tion in which — 99 » 

“She was hypothesizing nothing

of the kind. She was blatantly and 
brazenly getting out of paying a 
traffic fine, and that was absolutely 
all. And you can carry it one step 
further; do you think that for one 
split second the policeman actually 
believed that she was inviting him? 
Of course he didn’t! And yet that 
situation is one that has obtained 
through the ages. Women have al- 
ways been able to get what they 
wanted from men by pretending to 
promise a thing which they know r 
men want but will not or cannot 
take. Mind you. I’m not talking 
about situations where this yielding 
is the main issue. I’m talking about 
the infinitely greater number of oc- 
casions where yielding has nothing 
to do with it. Like w’easeling out of 
traffic tickets.” 

“Or skillfully gaining your hus- 
band’s reluctant attention over the 
breakfast table.” 

Her sudden laughter was like a 
shower of sparks. “You’d better get 
down to the Institute,” she said. 
“You’ll be late.” 

He arose, picked up his book and 
pamphlet, and walked slowly to the 
door. Lucinda came with him, 
hooking her arm through his. Sud- 
denly he stopped, and without look- 
ing at her, asked quietly, “That po- 
liceman was a manipulated, undig- 
nified fool, wasn’t he?” 

“Of course he was, darling, and 
it made a man of him.” 

He nodded as if accepting a 
statistic, and, kissing her, walked 
out 1 of the house.

polished blue-print . I think Fve

NEVER UNDERESTIMATE 

She watched him walk with his 
even, efficient, unhurried stride to 
the gate. There he paused and 
looked back. 

“This has been going an too 
long/* he called. “I shall alter it.” 
Lucinda stopped smiling. 

AY I come in?” 

“Jenny, of course.” Lu- 
cinda went to the kitchen door and 
unhooked it. “Come in, come in. 
My, you’re prettier than ever this 
morning.” 

“I brought you violets,” said 
Jenny breathlessly. “Just scads of 
’em in the woods behind my place. 
You took your red curtains down. 
Is that a new apron? My! you had 
Canadian bacon for breakfast.” 

She darted in past Lucinda, a 
small, wiry, vibrant girl with sun- 
lit hair and moonlit eyes. “Can I 
help with the dishes?” 

“Thank you, you doll.” Lucinda 
took down a shallow glass bowl for 
the violets. 

Jenny busily ran hot water into 
the sink. “I couldn’t help seeing,” 
she said. “Your big picture win- 
dow . Lucinda, you never leave 
the breakfast dishes. I keep telling 
Bob, some day I’ll have the 
routines you have, everything al- 
ways so neat, never running out of 
anything, never in a hurry, never 
surprised . anyway, all the way 
over I could see you just sitting by 
the table there, and the dishes not 
done and all ... is everything all 
right? I mean, don’t tell me if I 
shouldn’t ask, but 1 couldn’t 
help . Her voice trailed off into 
an ardent and respectful mumble. 



103 

“You’re such a sweetheart,” Lu- 
cinda said mistily. She came over 
to the sink carrying clean dish- 
towels and stood holding them, 
staring out past Jenny’s head to the 
level lawns of the village. “Actual- 
ly, I did have something on my 
mind . something . , 

She related the whole conversa- 
tion over breakfast that morning, 
from her abrupt and partial men- 
tioning of the anecdote about the 
blonde and the policeman, to her 
husband’s extraordinary and- un- 
equivocal statement about women’s 
power over men: This has bee?i go - 
ing on too long. I shall alter it. 

“Is that all?” Jenny asked when 
she had finished. 

“Mm. It’s all that was said.” 

“Oh, I don’t think you should 
worry about that.” She crinkled up 
her eyes, and Lucinda understood 
that she was putting herself and her 
young husband in the place of Lu- 
cinda and Dr. Lefferts, and trying 
to empathize a solution. “I think 
you might have hurt his feelings a 
little, maybe,” Jenny said at length. 
“I mean, you admitted that you 
handled him in much the same way 
as that blonde handled the police- 
man, and then you said the po- 
liceman was a fool” 

Lucinda smiled. “Very shrewd. 
And what’s your guess about that 
parting shot?” 

Jenny turned to face her. 
“You’re not teasing me, asking my 
opinion, Lucinda? I never thought 
I’d see the day l Not you* — you’re 
so wise!” 

Lucinda patted her shoulder. 
“The older I get, the more I feel 
that among women there is a low- 





104 



est common denominator of wis- 
dom, and that the chief difference 
between them is a random scatter- 
ing of blind spots. No, honey, I’m 
not teasing you. You may be able 
to see just where I can’t. Now tell 
me: what do you think he meant 
by that?’ 5 

“ e I shall alter it', Jenny quoted 
thoughtfully. “Oh, I don’t think 
he meant anything much. You 
showed him how you could make 
him do things, and he didn’t like it. 
He’s decided not to let you do it 
any more, but — but . 

“But what?” 

“Well, it’s tike with Bob. When 
he gets masterful and lays down the 
law I just agree with him. He for- 
gets about it soon enough. If you 
agree with men all the time they 
can*t get stubborn about anything.”**- 

Lucinda laughed aloud. “There’s 
the wisdom!” she cried. Sobering, 
site shook her head. “You don’t 
know the doctor the way I do. He’s 
a great man — a truly great one, 
with a great mind. It’$ great in a 
way no other mind has ever been. 
H6V-~ different. Jenny, I know how 
people talk, and what a lot of them 
say. People wonder why I married 
him, why I’ve stayed with him all 
these years. They say he’s stuffy 
and didactic and that he has no 
sense of humor, Weil, to them he 
may be ; but to me hfc is a continual 
challenge. The rules-of- thumb that 
keep most men in line don’t apply 
to him. 

“And if he says he can do some- 
thing, he can. If he says he will do 
something, he will.” 

Jenny dried her hands and sat 
down slowly. “He meant,” she said 



THEODORE STURGEON 

positively, “that he would alter 
your ability to make him do things. 
Because die only other thing he 
could have meant was that he was 
going to alter the thing that makes 
it possible for any woman to han- 
dle any man. And that just 
couldn’t be. How could he change 
human nature?” 

“How? How? He’s the scientist. 
I’m not. I simply eliminate that* 
‘how’ from my thinking. The worri- 
some thing about it is that he 
doesn’t think in small ways about 
small issues. I’m afraid that’s just 
what he meant — that he was going 
to change some factor in humanity 
that is responsible for this power 
we have over men.” 

“Oh . really.” said Jenny. She 
looked up at Lucinda, moved her 
hands uneasily. “Lucinda, 1 know 
how great the doctor is, and how 
much you think of him, but — but 
no one man could do such a thing! 
Not ouside of his own home.” She 
grinned fleetingiy. “Probably not 
inside of it, for very long ... 1 
never understood just what sort of 
a scientist he is. Can you tell me, I 
mean, aside from any secret proj- 
ects he might be on? Like Bob, 
now; Bob’s a high -temperature 
metallurgist. What is the doctor, 
exactly?” 

“That’s the right question to 
ask,” Lucinda said, and her voice 
was shadowed. “Dr. Lefferts is a— 
well, the closest you could get to it 
would be to call him a specializing 
non-specialist. You see, science has 
reached the point where each 
branch of it continually branches 
into specialties, and each specialty 
has its own crop of experts. Most 




experts live in the confines of their 
own work. The doctor was saving 
just the other day that he'd dis- 
covered a fluorine-boron step-reac- 
tion in mineralogy that had been 
known for so long that the miner- 
alogists had forgotten about it — 
yet it was unknown to metallurgy. 
Just as I said a moment ago, his 
mind is great, and — different. His 
job is to draw together the chem- 
ists and the biologists, the pure 
mathematicians and the practical 
physicists, the clinical psychologists 
and the engineers and all the other 

-ists and -ologies. His specialty is 
scientific thought as applied to all 
the sciences. He has no assignments 
except to survey all the fields and 
transfer needed information from 
one to the other. There has never 
been such a position in the Institute 
before, nor a man to fill it. And 
there is no other institute like this 
one on earth. 

“He has entree into every shop 
and lab and library in this Insti- 
tute, He can do anything or get 
anything done in any of them. 

“And when he said T shall alter 
that* he meant what he said!” 

41 T never knew that’s what he 
did, 55 breathed Jenny. “I never 
knew that’s what . who he is. 55 

“That's who he is.” 



“But what can he 



change 






Jenny burst out. “What can he 
change in us, in all men, in all 
women? What is the power he’s 
talking about, and where does it 
come from, and what wou 
will . happen if it’s changed?” 

“I don’t know,” Lucinda said 
thought! ully, 4 4 1 — do-— not— know. 

f 4 fof nrir!<p in tbs* rrtnwrf i’KIa 




that sort of thing is just one of the 
things a woman naturally does, be- 
cause she Is a woman, without 
thinking of it.” 

Unexpectedly, Jenny giggled. 
“You don’t plan those things. You 
just do them. It’s nice when it 
works. A better roast from the 
butcher. A reminder from one of 
the men at the bank that a check’s 



overdrawn, in time to cover it.” 

“I know, 5 ’ smiled Lucinda, “I 

know'. It’s easy and inaccurate to 
say that all those men are on the 
prowl — or all those women either. 
A few are, but most are not. The 
willingness of men to do things for 
women has survived even equal op- 
portunity and equal pay for wom- 
en. The ability of women to get 
what they want from men lies com- 
pletely in their knowledge of that 
willingness. So the thing my hus- 
band wants to alter — will alter — 






lies in that department. 

“Lucinda, why don’t you just ask 
him?” 

“I shall. But I don’t know if I’ll 
get an answer. If he regards it as a 
security matter, nothing will get it 
out of him.” 

4 4 You 1 11 tell me, won’t you?” 
“Jenny, my sweet, if he tells me 
nothing, I can’t tell you. If he tells 
me and asks me to keep his con- 
fidence, I won’t tell you. If he tells 
me and puts no restrictions on it. 
I’ll tell you everything.” 

“But—” > 

“I know, dear. You’re thinking 
that it’s a bigger thing than just 
what it might mean to the two of 
us. Well, you’re right. But 
deep I’m confidents I’d pit

pect them to win out. But anytime 
all womankind is against all man- 
kind, the men don't stand a chance. 
Think hard about it, anyway. At 
least we should be able to figure 
out where the attack is coming 
from.” 

“At least you admit it’s an at- 
tack” # / 

“You bet your sweet life it’s an 
attack. There's been a woman be- 
hind most thrones all through his- 
tory. The few times that hasn’t 
been true, it’s taken a woman to 
clean up the mess afterward. We 
won’t give up easily, darling!” 

T HE NORTH wind doth 

blow’, and we shall have 
snow’, and so on ” said Lucinda 
as she lit the fire. “I’m going to 
need a new coat.” 

“Very well,” said Dr. LefTerts. 
“A fur coat this time.” 

“Fur coats,” pronounced the 

doctor, “are impractical. Get one 
with the fur inside. You’ll keep 
warmer with less to carry’.” 

“I want a fur coat with the fur 
outside, where it shows.” 

“I understand and at times ad- 
mire the decorative compulsions,” 
said the doctor, rising from the ad- 
justed cube he used for an easy 
chair, “but not when they are un- 
healthy, uneconomical, and ineffi- 
cient. My dear, vanity does not be- 
come you.” 

“A thing that has always fasci- 
nated me ” said Lucinda in a 
dangerously quiet voice, “in rab- 
bits, weasels, skunks, pumas, pan- 
das, and mink, and all other known 
mammals and marsupials, is their 



THEODORE STURGEON 

huge vanity. They all wear their 
fur outside.” 

He put on his pince-nez to stare 
at her. “Your logic limits its fac- 
tors. I find such sequences remark- 
able because of the end results one 
may obtain. However, I shall not 
follow this one.” 

“If you’re so preoccupied with 
efficiency and function,” she 
snapped, “why do you insist on 
wearing those pince-nez instead of 
getting corneal lenses?” 

“Functional living is a pattern 
which includes all predictable 
phenomena,” he said reasonably. 
“One of these is habit. I recognize 
that I shall continue to like pince- 
nez as much as I shall continue to 
dislike rice pudding. My function- 
alism therefore includes these 
glasses and excludes that particular 
comestible. If you had the fur-coat 
habit, the possibility of a fur coat 
would be calculable. Since you 
have never had such a coat, we' can 
consider the matter disposed of.” 
“I think some factors were se- 
lected for that sequence,” said Lu- 
cinda between her teeth, “but I 
can’t seem to put my finger on the 
missing ones.” 

“I beg your pardon?” 

“I said,” appended Lucinda dis- 
tinctly, “that speaking of factors, I 
wonder how you’re coming with 
your adjustment of human nature 
to eliminate the deadliness of the 

female.” 

“Oh, that. I expect results mo- 
mentarily.” 

“Why bother?” she said bitterly. 
“My powers don’t seem to be good 
enough for a fur coat as it is.” 
“Oh,” he said mildly, “were -you

using them? 9 ’ 

Because she was Lucinda, she 
laughed. “No, darling, I wasn’t;’ 
She went to him and pressed him 
hack into the big cubical chair and 
sat on the arm. “I was demanding, 
cynical, and unpleasant. These 
things in a woman represent the 
scorched earth retreat, rather than 
the looting advance.” 

“An excellent analogy/’ he said. 
“Excellent. It has been a long and 
bitter war, hasn’t it? And now it’s 
coming to an end. It is an extraor- 
dinary thing that in our difficult 
progress toward the elimination of 
wars, we have until now ignored 
the greatest and most pernicious 
conflict of all — the one between the 
sexes.” 

“Why so pernicious?” she chuck- 
led. “There are times when it’s 
rather fun.” 

He said solemnly, “There are 
moments of exhilaration, even of 
glory, in every great conflict. Rut 
such conflicts tear down so much 
more than they build.” 

“What’s been so damaging about 
the war between the spxes?” 

“Though it has been the women 
who made men, it has been largely 
men who have made the world as 
we know it. However, they have 
had to do so against a truly terrible 
obstacle: . the emotional climate 
created by women. Only by becom- 
ing an ascetic can a man avoid the 
oscillations between intoxication 
and distrust instilled into him by 
women. And ascetics usually are al- 
ready insane or rapidly become so.” 
“I think you’re overstating a 
natural state of affairs.” 

4 T am overstating/ 9 he admitted, 



“for clarity’s sake, and off the rec- 
ord. However, this great war is by 
no means natural On the contrary, 
it is a most unnatural state of af- 
fairs. You see, homo sapieris is, in 
one small but important respect, an 
atypical mammal” 

“Do tell.” 

He raised his eyebrows, but con- 
tinued. “In virtually all species hut 
ours, the female has a rigidly fixed 
cycle of conjugal acceptability.” 
“But the human female has a — ” 
“I am not referring to that lunar 
cycle, unmentionable everywhere 
except in blatant magazine adver- 
tisements/ 5 he said shortly, “but to 
a cycle of desire. Of rut.” 

“A pretty word.” Her eyes began 
to glitter. 

“Mahomet taught that it oc- 
curred every eight days, Zoroaster 
nine days, Socrates and Solon 
agreed on ten. Everyone e]#e, as far 
as I can discover, seems to disagree 
with these pundits, or to ignore the 
matter. Actually there are such 
cycles, but they are subtle at best, 
and differ in the individual from 
time to time, with age, physical ex- 
perience, geography, and even emo- 
tional state. These cycles are vestig- 
ial; the original, natural cycle 
disappeared early in the history of 
the species, and has been trembling 
on the verge ever since. It will be 
a simple matter to bring it back.” 
“May I ask how?” 

“You may not. It is a security 
matter.” 

“May I then ask what effect you 
expect this development to have?” 
“Obvious, isn’t it? The source of 
woman’s persistent and effective 
control over man, the thing that 




108 



makes him subject to all her in- 
tolerances, whims, and bewildering 
coyness, is the simple fact of her 
perennial availability. She has no 
regular and predictable cycle of de- 
sire. The lower animals have. Dur- 
ing the brief time that a female 
mouse, a marten, or a mare is ap- 
proachable, every male of her 
species in the vicinity will know of 
it and seek her out; will, in effect, 
drop everything to answer a basic 
call. But unless and until that call 
occurs, the male is free to think of 
other things. With the human fe- 
male, on the other hand, the call is 
mildly present at all times, and the 
male is never completely free to 
think of other things. It is natural 
for this drive to be strong. It is un- 
natural indeed for it to be constant. 
In this respect Freud was quite cor- 
rect; nearly every neurosis has a 
sexual Ijasis. We are a race of neu- 
rotics, and the great wonder is that 
we have retained any of the ele- 
ments of sanity at all. I shall liber- 
ate humanity from this curse. I 
shall restore the natural alterna- 
tions of drive and rest. I shall free 
men to think and women to take 
their rightful places as thinking in- 
dividuals beside them, rather than 
be the forced-draft furnaces of sex- 
ual heat they have become.” 

“Are you telling me,” sajd Lu- 
cinda in a small, shocked voice, 
“that you have found a way to — 
to neuterize women except for a 
few hours a month?” 

“I am and I have,” said Dr. Lef- 
ferts. “And incidentally, I must say 
I am grateful to you for having 
turned me to this problem.” He 
looked up sharply. “Where are you 



THEODORE STURGEON 

going, my dear?” 

‘Tve got to th- think,” said Lu- 
cinda, and ran from the room. If 
she had stayed there for another 
fifteen seconds, she knew she would 
have crushed his skull in with the 
poker. 

W HO — Oh, Lucinda! How 

nice. Come in . why, 
what’s the matter?” 

“Jenny, Tve got to talk to you. 
Is Bob home?” 

“No. He’s got night duty at the 
high temperature lab this week. 
Whatever is wrong?” 

“It’s the end of the world,” said 
Lucinda in real anguish. She sank 
down on the sofa and looked up at 
the younger woman. “My husband 
is putting a — a chastity belt on 
every woman on earth.” 

“A what?” 

“A chastity belt.” She began to 
laugh hysterically. “With a time- 
lock on it.” 

c 

Jenny sat beside her. “Don’t,” 
she said. “Don't laugh like that. 
You’re frightening me.” 

Lucinda lay back, gasping. “You 
should be frightened . Listen to 
me, Jenny. Listen carefully, because 
this is the biggest thing that has 
happened since the deluge.” She 
began to talk. 

Five minutes later Jenny asked 
dazedly, “You mean- -if this crazy 
thing happens Bob won’t . won’t 
want me most of the time?” 

“It’s you who won’t do .any want- 
ing. And when you don’t, he won’t 
want either. ... It isn’t that that 
bothers me so much, Jenny, now 
that I’ve had a chance to think

about it. Fm worried about the 
revolution.” 

4 ‘What revolution?” 

“Why, this is going to cause the 
greatest social upheaval of all time! 
Once these cycles become recog- 
nized for what they are, there will 
be fireworks. Look at the way we 
dress, the ’way we use cosmetics. 
Why do we do it? Basically, to ap- 
pear to be available to men. Prac- 
tically all perfumes have a musk 
or musk-like base for that very rea- 
son. But how long do you think 
women will keep up the hypocrisy 
of lipstick and plunging necklines 
when men know better — know that 
they couldn’t possibly be approach- 
able all the time? How many men 
will let their women appear in pub- » 
lie looking as if they were?” 

“They’ll tie us up in the house 
the way I do Mitzi-poodle,” said 
Jenny in an awed tone. 

“They’ll leave us smugly alone 
with easy minds for three weeks out 
of four,” said Lucinda, “and stand 
guard over us like bull elks the rest 
of the time, to keep other men 
away.” 

“Lucinda!” Jenny squeaked and 
covered her face in horror. “What 
about other women? How can we 
compete with another woman 
when she’s— she’s — and we’re not?” 
“Especially when men are con- 
ditioned the way they are. Women 
will want to stick to one man, more 
likely than not. But men — men, 
building up pressures for weeks on 
end . ” 

“There’ll be harems again,” said 
Jenny. 

“This is the absolute, final, bitter 
end of any power we ever had over 



the beasts, Jenny — do you see that? 
All the old tricks — the arch half- 
promise, the come-on, the manipu- 
lations of jealousy— they*!! be utter- 
ly meaningless! The whole arsenal 
of womankind is based on her 
ability to yield or not to yield. And 
my husband is going to take the 
choice away from us. He’s going to 

make it absolutely certain that at 

* 

one time we can’t yield, and at an- 
other we must!” 

“And they’ll never have to be 
nice to us at either time,” added 
Jenny miserably. 

“Women,” said Lucinda bitterly, 
“are going to have to work for a 
living.” 

“But we do!” 



“Oh, you know what I mean, 

J enny! The iit-tul wife in the lit-fcul 
ome . that whole concept is 
based on women’s perpetual avail- 
ability. We’re not going to be able 
to be home-makers, in that sense, at 
monthly intervals.” 

Jenny jumped up. Her face was 
chalky. “He hasn’t stopped any 
war,” she ground out. Lucinda had 
never seen her like this. “He’s 
started one, and it’s a beaut. Lucin- 
da, he’s got to be stopped, even if 
you — we have to . 

“Gome on.” 

They started for Dr. Lefferts’ 
house, striding along dike a couple 
of avenging angels. 



A h ; 5 said dr. lefferts, 

rising politely. “You brought 
Jenny. Good evening. Jenny.” 
Lucinda planted herself in front 
of him and put her hands on her 
hips. “'You listen to me,” she 




no 



growled. “You’ve got to stop that 
nonsense about changing women.” 
“It is not nonsense and I shall 
do nothing of the kind ” 

“Dr* Lefferts,” said Jenny in a 
quaking voice, “can you really do 
this — tins awful thing?” 

“Of course,” said the doctor. “It 
was quite simple, once the princi- 
ples were worked out. 3 '' 

“It was quite simple? You mean 
you’ve already — ” 

Dr. Lefferts looked at his watch. 
“At two o’clock this afternoon. 
Seven hours ago.” 

“I think,” said Lucinda quietly, 
“that you had better tell us just ex- 
actly what you did, and what we 
can expect.” 

“I told you it is a security mat- 
ter” 

“What has my libido to do with 
national defense?” 

“That,” said the doctor, in a tone 
which referred to that as the merest 
trifle, “is a side issue. I coincided 
it with a much more serious proj- 
ect.” 

“What could be more serious 
than . 

“There’s only one thing that 
serious, from a security stand- 
point,” said Lucinda. She turned 
to the doctor. “I know better than 
to ask you any direct questions. But 
if I assume that this horrible thing 
was done in conjunction with a 
super-bomb test — just a guess, you 
understand — is there any way for 
an H-blast to bring about a change 
in women such as you describe?” 
He clasped both hands around 
one knee and looked up at her in 
genuine admiration. “Brilliant,” he 
said.. “And most skilfully phrased. 



* THEODORE STURGEON 

Speaking hypothetically — hypothet- 
ically, you understand,” he inter- 
jected, waving a warning finger, “a 
hydrogen bomb has an immense 
power of diffusion. A jet of energy 
of that size, at that temperature, for 
even three or four microseconds, is 
capable of penetrating the upper 
reaches of the stratosphere. But the 
effect does not end there. The up- 
ward displacement causes great 
volumes of air to rush in toward 
the rising column from all sides. 
This in turn is carried upward and 
replaced, a process which continues 
for a considerable time. One of the 
results must be the imbalance of 
any distinct high or low pressure 
areas within several thousand miles, 
and for a day or two freak weather 
developments can be observed. In 
other words, these primary and 
secondary effects are capable of dif- 
fusing a — ah — substance placed in 
the bomb throughout the upper at- 
mosphere, where, in a matter of 
days, it will be diffused throughout 
the entire envelope.” 

Lucinda clasped her hands in a 
slow, controlled way, as if one of 
them planned to immobilize the 
other and thereby keep both oc- 
cupied. 

“And is there any substance . , 
I’m still asking hypothetical ques- 
tions, you understand — is there 
anything which could be added to 
the hydrogen fusion reaction which 
might bring about these — these 
new cycles in women?” 

"‘They are not new cycles,” said 
the doctor flatly. “They are as old 
as the development of warm- 
blooded animals. The lack of them 
is, in biological terms, a very recent 



1 ! 



NEVER UNDERESTIMATE 

development in an atypical mam- 
ma 1; so recent and so small that it 
is subject to adjustment. As to your 
hypothetical question — ” he smiled 
— “I should judge that such an ef- 
fect is perfectly possible. Within the 
extremes of temperature, pressure, 
and radiation which take place in a 
fusion reaction, many things are 
possible. A minute quantity of cer- 
tain alloys, for example, introduced 
into the shell of the bomb itself, or 
perhaps in die structure of a sup- 
porting tower or even a nearby 
temporary shed, might kky a num- 
ber of phenomenal reaction chains. 
Such a chain might go through 
several phases and result in certain 
subtle isotopic alterations in one of 
the atmosphere’s otherwise inert 
gases, say xenon. And this isotope, 
acting upon the adrenal cortex and 
the parathyroid, which are instru- 
mental in controlling certain cycles 
in the human body, might very 
readily brin^ about the effect we 
are discussing in an atypical 
species.” 

Lucinda threw up her hands and 
turned to Jenny. ‘'Then that’s it,” 
she said wearily. 

“What’s ‘it’? What? I don’t 
understand,” whimpered Jenny. 
“What’s he done, Lucinda?” 

“In his nasty, cold-blooded hypo- 
thetical way,” said Lucinda, “he 
has put something in or near an 
H-bomb. which was tested today, 
which is going to have some effect 
on the air we breathe, which is 
going to do what we were discuss- 
ing at your house.” 

“Dr. Lefferts,” said Jenny pite- 
ously. She went to him, stood look- 
ing down at him as he sat primly in 



his big easy chair. “Why — why? 

Ju gt to annoy us? Just to keep us 
from having a little, petty influence 
over you?” 

“By no means/ 5 said the doctor. 

“I will admit that I might have 
turned my attention to the matter 

f 

for such reasons. But some concen- 
trated thought brought up a num- 
ber of extra-pol ations which are by 
no means petty.” 

H E ROSE and stood by the 

mantel, pince-nez in hand, the 

perfect picture of the Pedant At 
Home. “Consider,” he said. "'Homo 
sapiens , in terms of comparative 
anatomy, should mature physically 
at 35 and emotionally between 30 
and 40. He should have a life ex- 
pectancy of between 150 and 200 
years. And he unquestionably 
should be able to live a life un- 
cluttered by such insistent trifles as 
clothing conventions, unfunctional 
chivalries, psychic turmoils and 
dangerous mental and physical es- 
capes into what the psychologists 
call romances. Women should 
phase their sexual cycles with those 
of the seasons, gestate their young 
longer, and eliminate the unpre- 
dictable nature of their psycho- 
sexual appetites — the very basis of s 
all their insecurity and therefore 
that of most men. Women will not 
be chained to these cycles, Jenny, 
and become breeding machines, if 
that’s what you fear. You will be- 
gin to live in and with these cycles 
as you live with a well-made and 
serviced automatic machine. You 
wall be liberated from the constant 
control and direction of your go-

malic existence as you have been 

liberated from shifting gears in 

vour car.” 

* 

“But . we’re not conditioned 
for such a change!” blazed Lucin- 
da. “And what of the fashion in- 
dustry . cosmetics . the en- 
tertainment world . what’s go- 
ing to become of these and the 
millions of people employed by 
them, and the people dependent on 
all those people* if you do a thing 
like this?” ^ 

“The tiling is done. As for these 
people . tie paused. “Yes, there 
will be some disturbance. A con- 
siderable one. But in overall his- 
torical terms, it will be slight and it 
will be brief. I like to think that the 
television service man is one who 
was liberated by the cotton gin and 
the power loom.” 

“It’s . hard to think in his- 
torical terms just now.” said Lu- 
cinda. “Jenny, come on.” 

“Where are you going?” 

She faced him, her blued-steel 
eyes blazing. “Away from you. And 
I — I think I have a warning to give 
to the women.” 

“I wouldn’t do that,” he said 
dryly. “They’ll find out in time. All 
you’ll succeed in doing is to alert 
many women to the fact that they 
will be unattractive to their hus- 
bands at times when other women 
may seem more desirable. Women 
will not unite with one another, my 
dear, even to unite against men” 
There was a tense pause. Then 
jenny quavered, “How long did 
you say this — this thipg will take?” 
“I did not say. I would judge be- 
tween thirty-six and forty-eight 
hours.” 



“I’ve got to get home.” 

“May I come with you?” asked 

Lucinda. 

Jenny looked at her, her full face, 
her ample, controlled body, A sur- 
prising series of emotions chased 
themselves across her young face. 
She said, “I don’t think ... I mean 
. no, not tonight; I have to — -to — - 
goodnight, Lucinda.” 

When she had gone, the doctor 
uttered one of his rare chuckles. 
“She has absorbed perhaps a tenth 
of this whole concept,” he said, 
“but until she’s surer of herself she’s 
not going to let you or any woman 
near her husband.” 

“You . you complacent pig ! 93 
said Lucinda whitely. She stormed 
upstairs. 

ELLO . hello — Jenny?” 
“Lucinda I I’m — glad you 

called.” 

Something cold and tense deep 
inside Lucinda relaxed. She sat 
down slowly on the couch, leaned 
back comfortably with the tele- 
phone cradled between her cheek 
and her* wide soft shoulder. “I’m 
glad you’re glad, Jenny darling. It’s 
been six weeks . how are you?” 
“I’m ... all right now. It was 
pretty awful, for a while, not know- 
ing how it would be, waiting for it 
to happen. And when it did hap- 
pen, it was hard to get used to. But 
it hasn’t changed things too much. 
How about you?” 

“Oh, I’m fine,” said Lucinda. 
She smiled slowly, touched her 
tongue to her full lower lip. “Jenny, 
have you told anyone?” 

“Not a soul. Not even Bob. I 




p 



think he’s a little bewildered. He 
thinks I’m being very . under- 
standing. Lucinda, is it wrong for 
me to let him think that?” 

“It’s never wrong for a woman 
to keep her knowledge to herself if 
it makes her more attractive,” said 
Lucinda, and smiled again. 

“How’s t)r. Lefferts?” 

“He’s bewildered too. I suppose 
I’ve been a little . understanding 
too.” She chuckled. 

Over the phone she heard Jen- 
ny’s answering laughter. “The poor 
things,” she said. “The poor, poor 
things. Lucinda — ” 

“Yes, honey.” 

U I know how to handle this, now. 
But I don’t really understand it. 
Do you?” 

“Yes, I think I do.” 

“How can it be, then? How can 
this change in us affect men that 
way? I thought we would be the 
ones who would be turned off and 
on like a neon sign.” 

tc What? Now wait a minute, Jen- 
ny! You mean you don’t realize 
what’s happened?” 

“That’s what I just said. How 
could such a change in women do 
such a thing to the men?” 

“Jenny, I think you’re wonder- 
ful, wonderful, wonderful,” 
breathed Lucinda. “As a matter of 
fact, I think women are wonderful. 
I suddenly realized that you haven’t 
the foggiest notion of what’s hap- 
pened, yet you’ve taken it in stride 
and used it exactly right!” 
“Whatever do you mean?” 
“Jenny., do you fee] any differ- 



ence in yourself?” 

“Why, no. All die difference is in 
Bob. That’s what I — ” 

“Honey, there isn't any differ- 
ence in you, nor in me, nor in any 
other woman. For the very first

Jenny’s voice was awed. “And I

'He’d better. Jenny, put down

glanced over at the hall closet,

THE END 





T HE GIANT space liner swung the ship. It lay there, its voyage 
down in a long arc, hung for over, waiting, 
an instant on columns of The thing at the controls had 
flame, then settled slowly into the great corded man-like arms. Its 
blast-pit. But no hatch opened; no skin was black with stiff fur. It had

eyes bulging from the base of a 
massive skull, Its body was ponder* 
ous, heavy, inhuman. 

After twenty minutes, a single 
air lock swung clear and a dozen 
armed men in Company uniforms 
went aboard. Still later, a truck 
lumbered up, the cargo hatch 
creaked aside, and a crane reached 
its long neck in for the cargo. 

Still no creature from the ship 
was seen to emerge. The truck driv- 
er, idly smoking near the hull, knew 
this was the Prescott , in from the 
Jupiter run — that this was the 
White Sands Space Port, But he 
didn’t know what was inside the 
Prescott and he’d been told it 
wasn’t healthy to ask. 

Cene O’Neil stood outside the 
electrified ware that surrounded the 
White Sands port and thought of 
many tilings. He thought of the 
eternal secrecy surrounding space 
travel; of the reinforced hush-hush 
enshrouding Company ships. No 
one ever visited the engine rooms. 
No one in all the nation had ever 
talked with a spaceman. Gene 
thought of the glimpse he’d gotten 
of the thing in the pilot’s window. 
Then his thoughts drifted back to 
the newsrooms of Galactic Press 
Service ; to Carter in his plush 
office. 

“Want to be a hero, son?” 

“Who, me? Not today. Maybe 



tomorrow. Maybe the next day.” 
“Don’t be cute. It’s an assign- 
ment. Get into White Sands.” 
“Who tried last?” 

“Tim Whiting.” 

“Where is Whiting now?” 
“Frankly we don’t know. But—” 
“And the four guys who tried 
before Whiting?” 

“We don’t know. But we’d like 
to find out.”

where you could do the sitting in

to all hell! 

Gene turned and walked up the 
sandy road toward the place where 
the gaudy neons of the Blue Moon 
told hard working men where they 
could spend their money. The Blue 
Moon. It was quite a place. 

Outside, beneath the big crescent 
sign, Gene stopped to watch the 
crowds eddying in and out. Then 

he went in, to watch them cluster 
around the slot machines and bend 
in eager rows over the view slots of 

the peep shows. 

He moved into the bar, dropped

Gene’s skull. Even as fiery darkness 
closed down he knew he’d found 
the way. But only a stupid news- 
paperman would take? it. Damn 
Carter! 

Gene went out. 

He seemed to be dreaming. Over 
him bent a repulsive, man-like face. 
But the man had fingernails grow- 
ing on his chin where his whiskers 
should have been. And his eyes 
were funny— walled, as though he 
bordered on idiocy. In the dream,

THE HELL SHIP 



Her soft hands fixed something 
over his eyes, something cold and 
wet. He felt grateful, but kept on 
trying to remember. Ah, he had it; 
the girls wore that kind of outfit in 
the Blue Moon in one of the skits 
they did, burlesquing a hospital. He 
took off the wet cloth and looked 
again. 

She was a dream. Even with her 
lips rouge -scarlet, her cheeks pink 
with makeup, her eyes heavy with 
artiface. 

“What gives, beautiful ?” He was 
surprised at the weakness of his 
voice. 

Her voice was hard, but nice, 
and it was bitter, as though she 
wanted hard people to know she 
knew the score, could be just a little 
harder. “You’re a spaceman now! 
Didn’t you know?” 

Gene grinned weakly. 6 T don’t 
know a star from a street light. No- 
body gets on the space crews these 
days — it’s a closed union.” 

Her laugh was full of a knowl- 
edge denied him. “That’s what I 
used to think!” 

She began to unstrap him from 
the hammock. Then she pushed 
back his hair, prodded at the pur- 
ple knob on his head with careful 
fingertips. 

“How come you’re on this ship?’* 
asked Gene, wincing but letting her 
fingers explore. 

“Shanghaied, same as you. I’m 
from the Blue Moon. I stepped out 
between acts for a breath of fresh 
air, and wham, a sack over the 
head and here I am. They thought 
you might have a cracked skull. 
One of the monsters told me to 
check you. No doctor on the ship.” 



Gene groaned. “Then I didn't 
dream it — there is a guy on this 
ship with fingernails instead of a 
beard on his chin!” 

She nodded. “You haven’t seen 
anything yet!” 

“Why are we here?” 

“You’ve been shanghaied to 
work the ship. Frn here for a dif- 
ferent purpose— these men can’t 
get off the ship and they’ve got to 
be kept them contented. We’ve got 
ourselves pleasant jobs, with mon- 
sters for playmates, and we can’t 
get fired. It’ll be the rottenest time 
of our lives, and the rest of our 
lives, as far as I can see.” 

Gene sank down, put the com- 
press back on his bump. “I don’t 
get it.” 

“You will. Fm not absolutely 
sure Fm right, but 1 know a little 
more about it than you.” 

“What’s your name?”' 

“They call me Queenie Brant. A 
name that fits this business. My real 
name is Ann O’Donnell.” 

“Queenie’s a horse’s name — I’ll 
call you Ann. Me, Fm Gene 
O’Neil.” 

“That makes us both Irish,” she 
said. He lifted the compress and 
saw the first really natural smile on 
her face. It was a sweet smile, intro- 
spective, dewy, young. 

“You were only a dancer” He 
said it flatly. 

For a long instant she looked at 
him. “Thanks. You got inside the 
gate on that one.” 

“It’s in your eyes* Fm glad to 
know you, Ann. And I’d like to 
know you better.” 

“You will. There’ll be plenty of 
time * we’re bound for lo.”

RAY PALMER 



“Where’s Io?” 

“One of Jupiter’s moons, you 
Irish ignoramus. It has quite a 
colony around the mines. Also it has 
a strange race of people. But Ann 
O’Donnell is going to live there if 
she can get off this ship. I don’t 
want fingernails growing on my 
chin.” 

O’Neil sat up. “I get it now! It’s 
something about the atomic drive 
that changes the crew!” 

“What else?” 

Gene looked at Ann, let his eyes 
rove over her figure. 

“Take a good look,” she said bit- ' 
terly. “Maybe it won't stay like this 
very long!” . 

“We’ve got to get off this ship!” 
said Gene hoarsely.. 

T HE DOOR of the stateroom 
opened. A sharp-nosed face 
peered in, followed by a misshapen 
body of a man in a dirty blue uni- 
form. Hair grew thick all around 
his neck and clear up to his ears. It 
also covered the skin from chin to 
shirt opening. The hair bristled, 
coarse as an animal’s. His voice was 
thick, his words hissing as though 
his tongue was too heavy to move 
properly. 

“Captain wants you, O’Neil.” 
Gene got up, took a step. He 
went clear across the room, banged 
against the wall. The little man 
laughed. 

“We’re in space ” Ann said. “We 
have a simulated gravity about a 
quarter normal. Here, let me put 
on your metal-soled slippers. 
They’re magnetized to hold you to 
the floor ” She bent and slipped 



the things on his feet, while Gene 
held his throbbing head. - 

The little man opened the door 
and went out. Gene followed, his 
feet slipping along awkwardly. 
After a minute his nausea lessened. 
At the end of the long steel corridor 
the little man knocked, then opened 
the door to a low' rumble of com- 
mand. He didn’t enter, just stood 
aside for Gene. Gene walked in, 
stood staring. 

The eyes in the face he saw were 
black pools of nothingness, without 
emotion, yet behind them an active 
mind was apparent. Gene realized 
this hairy thing was the Captain- 
even though he didn’t even wear a 
shirt! 

“You’ve shanghaied me,” said 
Gene. “I don’t like it.” 

The voice was huge and cold, 
like wind from an ice field. “None 
of us like it, chum. But the ships 
have got to sail. You’re one of us 
now', because we’re on our way and 
by the time you get there, there’ll 
be no place left for you to work, un- 
less it’s in a circus as a freak.” 

“I didn’t ask for it,” said Gene. 

“You did. You wanted to know 
too much about the crew — and if 
you found out, you'd spread it. You 
see, the drives are not what they 
were cooked up to be — the atomics 
leak, and it wasn’t found out until 
too late. After they learned, they 
hid the truth, because the cargo we 
bring is worth mil lions. All the 
shielding they’ve used so far only 
seems to make it worse. But that 
won’t stop the ships — they’ll get 
crews the way they got you, and 
nosey people will find out more 
than they bargain for.” 




THE HELL SHIP

“I won’t take it sitting down!” 
said Gene angrily. 

The Captain ignored him. “Start 
saying sir. It’s etiquette aboard ship 
to say sir to the Captain. 

‘Til never say sir to anyone who 
got me into this . .” 

The Captain knocked him down. 

Gene had plenty of time to block 
the blow. He had put up his arms, 
but the big fist went right through 
and crashed against his chin. Gene 
sat down hard, staring up at the 
hairy thing that had once been a 
man. He suddenly realized the 
Captain was standing there waiting 
for an excuse to kill him. 

Through split and bleeding lips, 
while his stomach turned over and 
his head seemed on the point of 
bursting. Gene said: “Yes, sir!” 

The Captain turned his back, sat 
down again. He shoved aside a 
mass of worn charts, battered in- 
struments, cigar butts, ashtrays 
with statuettes of naked girls in a 
half-dozen startling poses, comic 
books, illustrated magazines with 
sexy pictures, and made a space on 
the top. He thrust forward a sheet 
of paper. He picked up a fountain 
pen, flirted it so that .ink spattered 
the tangle of junk on his desk, then 
handed it to Gene. “Sign on the 
dotted line.” 

Gene picked up the document. It 
was an ordinary kind of form, an 
application for employment as a 
spacehand. third class. The ship 
was not named, but merely called 
a cargo boat. This was the paper 
the Company needed to keep the 
investigators satisfied that no one 
was forced to work on the ships 
against their will Anger blinded 



him. He didn’t take the pen. He 
just stood looking at the Captain 
and wondering how to keep himself 
from being beaten to death. 

After a long moment of silence 
the Captain laid the pen down, 
grinned horribly. He gave a snort. 
“It's just a formality. Pm supposed 
to turn these things over to the 
authorities, but they never bother 
us anymore. Sign it later, after 
you’ve learned. You’ll be glad to 
sign, then.” 

“What’s my job, Captain?” 
“Captain Jorgens, and don’t for- 
get the sir!” 

“Captain Jorgens, sir.” 

“I’ll put you with the Chief En- 
gineer. He’ll find work for you 
down in the pile room.” 

The Captain laughed a nasty 
laugh, repeating the last phrase 
with relish. “The pile room! 
There’s a place for you, Mr. O’Neil. 
When you decide to sign your pa- 
pers, we’ll get you a job in same 
other part of this can!” 

Gene found his way back to the 
cabin he had just left. The little 
guy with the hairy neck was there, 
leering at the girl. 

“Put you in the pile gang didn’t 
he?” 

Gene nodded, sat down wearily. 
“I want to sleep,” he said. 

“Nuts,” said the little man. “I’m 
here to take you to the Chief En- 
gineer. You go on duty in half an 
hour. Come on!” 

Gene got up. He was too sick to 
argue. Ann looked at him sympa- 
thetically, noting his split lips. He 
managed a grin at her, “If I never 
see you again, Ann, it’s been nice 
knowing you, very Bice.” 




120 



‘Til see you, Gene. They’ll find 
us tougher than they bargained 
for.” 



T HE ENGINE room looked like 
some of the atomic power sta- 
tions he’d seen. Only smaller. There 
was no heavy concrete shielding, no 
lead walls. There was shielding 
around the central pile, and Gene 
knew that inside it was the hell of 
atomic chain reaction under the 
control of the big levers that moved 
the cadmium bars. There was a 
steam turbine at one end, and a 
huge boiler at the other. Gene 
didn’t even try to guess how the 
pile activated the jets that drove 
the space ship. Somehow it 
“burned” the water. 

This pile had been illegal from 
the first. Obviously some official 
had been bribed to permit the first 
use of it on a spaceship. Certainly 
no one who knew anything about 
the subject would have allowed hu- 
man beings to work around a thing 
like this. 

Gene’s skin crawled and prickled 
with the energies that saturated the 
room. Little sparks leaped here and 
there, off his finger-tips, off his 
nose. 

The Chief Engineer was on a 
metal platform above the ma- 
chinery level. The face had hair 
all over it, even on the eyelids. The 
eyes, popping weirdly, were double. 
They looked as if second eyes had 
started growing inside the original 
ones. They weren’t reasonable; they 
weren’t even sane. The look of 
them made Gene sick, 

The Engineer shook his head 



RAY PALMER 

back and forth to focus the awful, 
mutilated eyes. His voice was in- 
finitely weary, strangely muffled. 
“Another sacrifice to Moloch, an’s 
the pity! So they put you down 
here, as if there was anything to be 
done? Well, it’ll be nice to work 
with someone who still has his but- 
tons — as long as they last. Sit 
down.” 

Gene sat down and the metal 
chair gave him a shock that made 
him jump. “I don’t know anything 
about this kind of work.” 

The man shrugged, “Who does? 
The pile runs itself. Ain’t enough 
of it moves to need much greasing. 
You ought to be able to find the 
grease cups— they’re painted red. 
Fill them, wipe off the dust, and 
wait. Then do it over again.” 
“What’s the score on this 
bucket?” 

“We’re all signed on with a billy 
to the knob. And kept aboard by a 
guard system that’s pretty near per- 
fect. After awhile the emanations 
get to our brains and wc don’t care 
anymore. Then we’re trusted em- 
ployees. Only reason 1 don’t blow 
her loose, it wouldn’t do any good.” 
He got up, a fragile old body 
clad in dirty overalls. He beckoned 
Gene to follow him. He led the way 
to a periscope arrangement over 
the shielded pile. Gene peered in. 
It was like a look into boiling Hell. 
As Gene stared, the old man talked 

in his ear. 

‘‘Supposed to be perfectly 
shielded, and maybe they are. But 
something gets out. I think it hap- 
pens in the jet assembly. A tiny 
trickle of high pressure steam 
crosses the atomic beam just above 




THE HELL SHIP 



a pinhole that leads into the jet 
tube. It’s exploded by the beam, 
exploded into God knows what, 
and tlte result is your jet. It’s a 
wonderful drive, with plenty of 
power for the purpose. But I think 
it forms a strong field of static over 
the whole shell of the ship, a kind 
of sphere of reflection that throws 
the emanations back into the ship 
from every point. Just my theory, 
but it explains why you get these 
physical changes, because that proc- 
ess of reflection giveS a different 
ray than was observed in the or- 
dinary shielded jet.” 

Gene nodded, asked: “Can I 
look at the jet assembly?” 

“Ain’t no way to look at it! Ids 
sealed dp to hold in tire expanding 
gases from that exploded steam. 
Looking in this periscope is what 
changed my eyes. Only other place 
the unshielded emanations could 
escape is from the jet chamber. 
Only way they can get back into 
the ship is by reflection from some 
ionized layer around the ship. If I 
could talk to some of those big- 
brained birds that developed this 
drive. I’d sure have tilings to say.” 
Gene was convinced the old man 
knew what he was talking about. 
“Why don’t you try to put your in- 
formation where it’ll do some good? 
How about the Captain?” 

“He’s coocoo.” The old man 
slapped the cover back on the peri- 
scope, tottered back to his perch on 
the platform. “He sure has changed 
the last two years. Won’t listen to 
reason.” 

Gene squatted on the* steps, just 
beneath the old engineer’s chair. 
The old man seemed glad to have 



121 

someone to talk to. 

“It’s got us trapped. And it’s so 
well covered up from the people. 
Old spacers are changed physically, ' 
changed mentally. They know they 
cant go back to normal life, be- 
cause it’s gone too far. They’d be 
freaks. No woman would want a 
monstrosity around. Besides, it 
don’t stop, even after you leave the 
ships. God knows what we" 11 look 
like in the end.” 

Gene shivered. “But you’re all 
grown men! A fight with no chance 
of winning is better than this! Why 
do you take it?” 

“Because the mind changes along 
with the body. It goes dead in some 
ways, gets more active in others. 
The personality shifts inside, until 
you’re not sure of yourself, and 
can’t make decisions any more. 
That’s why nobody does anything. 
Something about those rays de- 
stroys the will. Nobody leaves the 
ships.” 

“I will!” Gene said confidently. 
“When the time comes, I’ll go. All 
Hell can’t stop me.” 

The old man yawned. “Hope 
you do, son. Hope you do. I’m go- 
ing to take me a nap.” He propped 
his feet up on the platform rail and 
in seconds was snoring. 

Gene clenched his fists, growing 
despair in his thoughts. * 

“Tain’t no worse than dying in 
a war,” muttered the old man in 
his sleep. 

T HE DAYS went by and Gene 

learned. He understood why 
these men didn’t actively resent the 
deal they were getting. No wonder 




RAY PALMER 



the secrecy was so effective! The 
radiations deadened the mind, gave 
one the feeling of numbness, so that 
nothing mattered but the next 
meal, the next movie in the rec- 
reation lounge, the next drink of 
water. Values changed and shifted, 
and none of them seemed impor- 
tant. 

The chains that began to bind 
him were far stronger than steel. 
The chains were mental deteriora- 
tion, degeneration, mutation within 
the very cells of the mind. He knew 
that now he must tend this monster 

ft 

forever, grease and wipe the ugly 
metal of it, and sit and talk idly to 
MacNamara, its keeper. He real- 
ized it, and didn’t know how to 
care ! 

The anger and hate came later. 
The real, abiding anger, and the 
living hate. At first the numbness, 
the sudden incomprehensible enor- 
mity of what had happened to him, 
then the anger. Hate churned and 
ground away inside him, getting 
stronger by the hour. It all revolved 
around the Captain who tramped 
eternally around the corridors bel- 
lowing orders, punching with his 
huge fists. He knew there was more 
to it; the lying owners of the Com- 
pany, the bribe-taking officials, the 
health officers who failed to exam- 
ine the ships and the men and the 
ships’ papers. But somehow it all 
boiled down to the Captain. 

Sometimes he was sure he must 
be crazy % already. Sometimes he 
would wake up screaming from a 
nightmare only to find reality more 
horrible. * V • 

Then he would go to Ann. 

Ann wits not the only woman 



aboard ship. There were three 
others, and to the crew of twenty 
imprisoned, enslaved men they 
represented all beauty, all woman- 
hood. They lived with the men — 
as the men — and nobody cared. 
Here, so close to the raging ele- 
mentals of the pile, life itself was 
elemental. 

As one of them expressed it to 
Gene: “Why worry? We’re all 

sterile from the radioactivity any- 
way. Or didn’t you know?” She 
had been on the ship for years, and 
was covered with a fine fur, like a 
cat’s. Her eyes were wide, placid, 
empty; an animal’s unthinking 
eyes. Gene prayed Ann would never 
turn monster before his eyes ; hoped 
desperately they could get away in 
time. 

“We’ve got to fight, Ann,” he 
said to her one day. “We must find 
a way to get off at the end of the 
trip, or it will be too late for us 
to live normal lives. It’s then of 
never. Besides that, we’ve got to 
warn people of what’s going on. 
They think space travel is safe. .In 
time this could effect the whole' 
race. The world must be told, so 
something can be done.” 

Ann’s young face showed signs 
of the strain. The fear of turning 
into some hideous thing was prey- 
ing on her mind. She spoke rapid- 
ly, her voice breaking a little. “I’ve 
been talking to several of the crew y 
the old-timers, trying to get an un- 
derstanding of why nothing is done. 
It’s this way: when the ships land, 
guards come aboard. They’re 
posted at the cargo locks and the 
passenger entrances. The only door 
aboard the ship that leads to the 




passenger compartment is in the 
Captain’s cabin, and it’s locked 
from both sides. Even our Captain 
never meets the passengers. There’s 
only one chance, a mutiny. Then 
we could open the door, show the 
passengers.” 

“It wouldn't do any good. When 
we landed, they’d find a way to 
shut us all up before we got to any- 
body. They’ve had a lot of practice 
keeping this quiet. They know the 
answers.” 

She stamped a foot angrily. “It 

was you who said we had to fight! 
Now you say it’s hopeless!” 

Gene leaned against the wall and 
passed a hand across his eyes. He 
looked at Ann’s flushed beauty and 
managed a grin. “Guess I’m getting 
as bad as the rest of them, baby. 
We’ll fight. Sure we’ll fight.” 

I T STARTED with Schwenky. 

Schwenky was a gigantic Swede. 
He was the boss freight handler. 
It was his job to sort the cargo for 
the next port of call. He would get 
it into the cargo lock, then seal the 
doors so nobody would ttfy to smug- 
gle themselves out with the freight. 
Schwenky was intensely loyal and 
stupid enough not to understand 
the real reason behind their im- 
prisonment — which was why he 

held his job. No one got by 
Schwenky. 

But this time, in Mar sport, some- 
thing was missing. They’d driven 
the trucks up to the cargo port, un- 
loaded everything, and then com- 
pared invoices with the material. 
They swore some claimed ma- 
chinery parts were due them. 



Schwenky swore he’d placed them 
in the cargo lock, and that the 
truckers were trying to hold up the 
Company. 

The Captain allowed the truck- 
ers’ claim and after the ship had 
blasted off into space, called 
Schwenky in to bawl him out. They 
must have gotten really steamed 
up, because Gene and Frank 
Maher heard the racket clear down 



on the next deck where they were 
cleaning freight out of a sealed 
compartment for the next stop. 

Gene and Frank raced up the 
ladders to the top deck, and Gene 
found the bi'eak he had prayed for. 
Schwenky holding the Captain 
against the wall; beating the mon- 
strosity that had once been a man 
with terrible fists. Gene felt a sud- 
den thrill. In a situation like this 
you used any weapon you could 
find. Schwenky was a deadly 
weapon. 

Gene laid a hand on Schwenky’s 
massive shoulder. “Hold it man! 
You’ll kill him!” - 

Schwenky turned a face, red and 
popeyed, to Gene. “The Captain 
make a mistake. He try to knock 
Schwenky down. No man do that 
to Schwenky.” 

“When he comes to, he’ll lock 
you in the brig, put you on bread 

and water. ” 



Suddenly Schwenky realized the 
enormity of his offense. It was ob- 
vious from his face that he consid- 
ered himself already dead. “Nah, 
my friend Gene! Now they kill 
Schwenky. Bad ! But what I do?” 
Gene eyed him carefully. “Put 
the Captain in the brig, of 
What else? The 






“Lock him up, eh? Good idea! 
Then we think, you and I, what we 
do next. Maybe something come to 
us, eh?” 

Gene bent over the Gap tain’s 
body, found the pistol in his hip 
pocket, put it in his own. He took 
the ring of keys from the belt. 

"Bring him along, Schwenky. If 
we meet anyone, I’ll use this.” 
Gene patted the gun. ‘‘I won’t let 
them hurt my friend, Schwenky.” 

“Damn! let them come! I fix 
them! Don’t have to shoot them. 
I got fists!” 

“I’d rather be shot, myself,” said 
Gene, watching the ease with which 
the giant freight handler lifted the 
huge body of the Captain, tossing 
it over his shoulder like a sack of 

stteiw 

•Til go ahead” said Frank 
Maher. “If I run into Perkins, the 
First, I’ll whistle once. If I run into 
Symonds, the Second, I’ll whistle 
twice. I don’t think there’s another 
soul aboard we need worry about. 
All we got to do is slap the Cap in 
the brig, round up Perkins and 
Symonds, and the ship is ours. 
What worries me, Gene, then what 
do we do?” 

“It’s Schwenky’ s mutiny,” 
grinned Gene. “Ask him.” 

“Nah!” said Schwenky hastily. 
“I don’ know. Maybe we just sail 
on till we find good place, leave 
ship, go look for job.” 

Maher said, “Me with my ‘lumpy 
face? And the Chief with hair on 
his cheekbones and double eyeballs? 
And Heinie with fingernails grow- 
ing where his collar button should 
be? I wonder what we cun do, if 






T hey got down the first 

stairwell, but passing along the 
rather lengthy companionway to 
the next stairhead, they heard 
Maher whistle twice. Schwenky .put 
the Captain down, conked him 
with one massive fist to make sure 
he stayed out, then stood there, 
waiting. The Second came up out 
of the stairwell, turned and started 
toward them. Gene put his hand on 
the gun butt, waiting until he had 
to pull it. Schwenky said: “Come 
here, Mr. Perkins, sir. Look see 
what has happened!” 

The Englishman peered at the 
shapeless, hairy mass of the uncon- 
scious Captain. His face went 
white. Gene knew he was wonder- 
ing if he could keep the crew from 
mutiny without the Captain pres- 
ent to cow them. Perkins straight- 
ened, his face a pallid mask in 
the dimness. “What happened, 
Schwenky?” 

“This, Mr. Perkins, sir — ” said 
Schwenky. He slapped an open 
palm against the side of Perkins’ 
head. Perkins sprawled full length 
on the steel deck, but he wasn’t out, 
which surprised Gene. He lay there, 
staring up at the gigantic Swede, 
his face half red from the terrible 
blow, the other half white with the 
fear in him. His hand was tugging 
at his side and Gene realized he 
was after his gun. Gene pulled out 
his own weapon even as he leaped 
upon the slim body of the man on 
the floor. His feet missed the mov- 



ing arm, the hand came out with a 
snub-hosed automatic in it. Gene

slugged the man across the head 
with the barrel of the Captain’s 
gun. Perkins went limp. Maher 
came up now and grabbed Perkins’ 
gun. 

“Lead on,” said Gene. He picked 
Perkins up and put him over his 

shoulder. Schwenkv retrieved the 

/ 

slumbering Captain and they pro- 
ceeded on their way to the cell on 
the bottom deck. 

But the shot had been heard, and 
from above came the sound of run- 
ning feet. Gene began to trot, ab 
most fell down the last flight of 
stairs, went along the companion- 
way at a run. At the cell door he 
dropped Perkins, tried four or five 
keys frantically. One fit. He pulled 
open the door and Schwenky drove 
in, kicking the body of Perkins over 
the sill. The Captain dropped 
heavily to the deck and Schwenky 
was out again. Gene was locking 
the door when he heard the shout 
from Symonds, running toward 
them. 

“What’s going on there, men?” 

Schwenky started to amble to- 
ward the dark, wiry Second, his big 
face smiling like that of a simple- 
ton. “We haf little trouble, Mr. 
Symonds, sir. Maybe we should call 
you, but we did not haf time. 
Everything is all right now. You 
come see, we explain every- 
thing , . ” 

He made a grab for- the little 
Second Mate’s neck with one big 
paw. But the Second was wary, 
ducked* quickly, was off. Gene and 
Maher sprang after him. Gene 
shouted: “Stop or I’ll fire, Sy- 

monds! You’re all alone now!” 

Gene let one &ho t angle off the 



wall, close beside the fleeing form, 
but the man didn’t stop. Instead 
he headed for the bridge. Gene re- 
alized he could lock himself in, 
keep them from the ship controls. 
He could hold out there the rest of 
the voyage. 

“We’ve got to stop him ! 55 

Maher close behind, they ran up 
the stairs on the Second’s heels. Up 
the companionway they pounded, 
the Second increasing his lead. A 
door opened ahead of him and Ann 
O’Donnell appeared. 

Symonds cursed and tried to pass 
her. Ann deftly slid out one pretty 
leg and the officer turned a somer- 
sault, and brought up against the 
wall at the foot of the stairs to the 
upper deck and the bridge. 

But the Second was too fright- 
ened to let a little thing like a fall 
stop him. He went scrambling up 
the stairs on all fours. Gene was still 
too far away, and Ann moved like 
a streak of light. She sailed through 
the air in a long dancer’s leap and 
with two bounds was up the stair, 
ahead of the scrambling, fear- 
stricken officer. 

“Out of my way, bitch,” and 
Symonds hurled himself- toward 
Ann. 

Gene leaped forward, but he 
needn’t have bothered. Ann lifted 
one of her educated feet, caught 
the Second under the chin and he 
came down the stair like a sack of 
meal. Gene caught his full weight. 

The two men fell in a scramble 
of flailing arms and legs, knocking 
the props out from under Maher, 
who had started out after them.

the recreation room to discuss a

for silence.

would happen now if we gave up!” 

Gene spoke up again. “Let me 
summarize the position we 7 re in— 
maybe then we can make a better 
decision.” 

“Go ahead.” said Ann. The oth- 
ers nodded and fell silent, waiting. 

Gene cleared his throat. “The 
way it looks to me, we’ve had a 
lucky accident in getting control of 
the ship. So far, we’ve • not con- 
tacted the passengers. They know 
nothing of the change that’s taken 
place. As it is, I see no point in 
contacting them. It might force us 
to face another mutiny, that of the 
passengers, who would regard us as 
what we are, mutineers, and when 
they found we weren’t going to our 
destination, they’d certainly not all 
take it lying down. Point number 
one, then, is to ignore the passen- 
gers, keep the knowledge of a 
mutiny from them. 

“Now, our real purpose in this 
mutiny is to expose this whole vi- 
cious secret slavery, tell Earth of 
the danger of the unshielded piles 
in space ships, destroy the Com- 
pany’s monopoly, and bring about 
new research which I’m sure 
would eventually overcome the dif- 
ficulty. Just how are we going to 
do that? The answer is simple— 
we must get back to Earth, and we 
must get back in a way the Com- 
pany will not be able to intercept 
us. As I understand it, this won’t 
be easy. The Company is in com- 
plete control of space travel, and 
they have die ships to knock us out 
of space before we can get near 
Earth. Somehow we’ve got to win 
through. Gan we do it by a direct 
return to Earth? I doubt it. How- 



127 

♦ 

ever, say we do it. Then where do 
we go? The government might look 
upon us as mutineers and thus give 
the Company a chance to quash 
the whole affair. 

“So we’ve got to go directly to 
the people, who, once they see us, 
and realize what space travel with 
these piles means, will demand an 
explanation with such public feel- 
ing even the government can’t 
avoid a showdown. It’s the secrecy 
we must break. Thus, we must land 
on Earth with the biggest pos- 
sible splurge of publicity. We’ve got 
to do it so no Company ship can 
prevent it. 

“Then there’s this to consider. 
Most of you would find it a difficult 
thing to take up a life on. Earth. 
I know that many of you want to 
take off for some remote world, and 
try to live out your lives by your- 
selves. I say that would be a cow- 
ardly thing to do. So, before we 
decide anything else, I say let’s de- 
cide here and now that the only 
thing we will do is go back to 

Earth.” 

One of the most grotesquely de- 
formed of the crew spoke up. “No 
woman would ever look at me,” he 
said defiantly. “Children would 
stare at me and scream in terror. 
I’ve suffered enough. Why should 
I suffer more?” 

The woman in the fine fur got to 
her feet and walked over to him. 
She sat down beside him and took 
his hand in hers. “I will look at 
you,” she said. “When we get back 
to Earth, I Will many you and live 
wifh you — if you are brave enough 
to take me there.” 

For an instant the crewman

stared at her out of his horribly 
bulging popeyes. then he swallowed 
hard and clutched her hand fiercely. 

“The Devil hinfself will hot keep 
me from it ! 55 he said hoarsely. 

Gene, staring at the man, felt a 
warm hand slip into his, and he 
turned to find Ann, 

“I think that answers for all of 
us,” she said. 

The room rang with the shouts of 
approval. 

Once more Gene began talking. 
“All right, then, I’ve a plan. First, 
we’ll try to find out how to ma- 
neuver this craft. I believe we can 
persuade one of the Mates to show 
us the controls without much 
trouble.” 

“Yah!” interrupted Schwenky. 
“They show!” ... 

“We’ll set a course for Earth by 
the sun. We’ll come in with the sun 
at our back, which means we’ll 
have to make a wide circle off the 
traveled spacelanes, through un- 
known space, and come in from the 
direction of the inner planets, 
which are uninhabited and unvis- 
ited. Also, with the sun behind us, 
we won’t be observed from Earth. 
Then, with all our speed, we’ll 
come in, land at high noon in Chi- 
cago, right in front of the offices 
of the Sentinel , the newspaper for 
which I work.” 

There was a chorus of exclama- 
tions. Ann looked at him in amaze- 
ment. “You, a newspaperman!” 
she gasped. 

“Yes. I was sent out by my boss 
to find out what was behind the 
secrecy of the space ships. I got 
shanghaied as a crew member. 
Now, with your help, maybe I can 



complete rriy assignment. Once we 
get to my boss, the show will be 
over. He’ll blast the story wide 
open ” 

“Wonderful!” shouted Maher. 
“Come, Schwenky! We will get* 
Perkins and make him show us how 
to run the ship!” 

Schwenky chortled in glee. 
“Yah! We get. By golly, I know 
that Gene O’Neill is good mail! 
Maybe I get my picture in news- 
paper?” 

Maher stared at him. “God for- 
bid!” he said. “Unless it’s in the 
cbmic section!” 

“Yah!” agreed Schwenky. “In 
comic section!” 



T WO WEEKS later, as the ship 
crossed Earth’s orbit and headed 
in behind the planet in the plane 
of the sun, the meteorite hit. It tore 
a great hole in the passenger side 
of the ship, and knocked out the 
port jets. 

The ship veered crazily under 
the influence of its lopsided blast, 
and the crew was hurled against 
the wall and pinned there as the 
continuing involuntary maneuver 
built up acceleration. 

Gene, who had been in his bunk, 
was pressed against the wall by a 
giant hand. Savagely he fought to 
adjust himself into a more bear- 
able position, then tried to figure 
out what had happened. Obviously 
the ship was veering about, out of 
control.- 

“Meteorite!” he gasped. “We’ve 
been hit.” * 

* 

He pulled himself from the bunk, 
slid along the wall to the ddtsU It 




THE HELL SHIP 



was all he could do to open it, but 
once in the companionway outside* 
he found that he could crawl along 
one wall, off the floor, in an inch- 
ing progress. He ma.de it finally to 
the control room, and forced his 
body around the door jamb and in- 
side. Against the far wall Maher 
was plastered, dazed, but conscious. 
At his feet lay Heinie, his head 
crushed, obviously dead. 

“Cut off the rest of the jets!” 
gasped Maher. T can’t make it!” 
Gene crawled slowly around the 
room, following the wall, until 
he could reach the controls, then he 
pulled the lever that controlled the 
jet blast. The ship’s unnatural 
veering stopped instantly and both 
Maher and Gene dropped heavily 
to the floor. 

Gene was up first and helped 
Maher to his feet. Together they 

turned to the indicators. 

“Passenger deck’s out!” said 
Maher. “Except for a few compart- 
ments. The automatic seals have 
operated. But there must be some- 
body left alive in them.” 

“We’ve got to get them,” said 
Gene. “But first, we’ve got to check 
up on what damage has been done 
here, and how many casualties we 
have.” 

“Heinie’ s dead,” said Maher. 
“He hit the wall with his head ” 
Gene shuddered, and deep in his 
stomach nausea churned. ‘He 
thought of Ann and his blood froze 
In his veins. “You take below decks. 
IT! go up,” he said. Ann’s cabin 
was on the deck above. 

Maher nodded and staggered 
away. Gene scrambled up the stair- 
well as fast as he could, and ran 



down the. corridor. At Ann’s door 
he stopped, turned the knob. The 
door opened. The room was empty. 

Suddenly he heard running foot- 
steps, and Ann threw herself into 
his arms, sobbing. 

“Where were you?” he asked, 
almost savagely. 

“I went to your cabin, to see if 

you were hurt. What happened to 
the ship?” 

“Meteorite hit us. Knocked out 
the passenger deck. Most of the 
passengers will be dead, but we’ve 
got to go in and rescue the sur- 
vivors.” 

Doors were opening here and 
there and the crew members able 
to make it were congregating 
around them. They went to the 
recreation room. There Gene 
counted noses. Five crewmen were 
missing. Of those present, six men 
were injured, and one woman ex- 
hibited a black eye, accentuating 
her other abnormalities. The three 
prisoners were reported unharmed. 

“What about the missing men?” 
Gene asked. 

“Three dead,” Maher replied, 
“two badly hurt. We’ll need some- 
body to look after them.” 

“I’ll go,” volunteered Ann. The 
woman in fur stepped forward also, 
and they left the room behind 
Maher and Schwenky. 

Gene faced the rest. “We’ve got 
a real problem now. With a re- 
duced crew, we’ll have to finish a 
trip that would have been tough 
with an uninjured ship. But first, 
we’ve got to search the passenger 
deck and remove the survivors. All 
of you who are able, put on pres- 
sure suits and come with me/* 




RAY PALMER 



130 

He led the way to the locker con- 
taining the pressure suits. Seven 
men, those who were not too de- 
formed to don the suits, made up 
the party. Gene led the way to the 
Captain’s stateroom, ordered the 
door sealed behind them, then 
opened the only door to the dam- 
aged deck. The air rushed out as 
the door swung open, and suddenly 
complete silence descended upon 
them. There would be no more 
communication between them ex- 
cept for signs. 

In an hour they had determined 
the truth. All passengers but one, 
a woman, had been killed instant- 
ly. The woman was unconscious, 
but suffering only from bruises. It 
had been necessary, after discover- 
ing her unpierced cabin, to return 
to the deck above and cut through 
with a torch. 

When she regained consciousness 
and saw her rescuers, she screamed. 

“That’ll give us some idea of how 
the people back on Earth will re- 
ceive us” said Gene. “If we get 
there, that is.” 

Later, in the control room, 
Maher and MacNamara gave their 
report. 

“We can make it,” said Mac- 

* ® 

Namara, “but we’ll come in limp- 
ing like a wounded moose. If any 
of the Company ships sight us, 
we’ll be a sitting duck. But maybe 
it will be better that way. This is 
like war, and some of us must 
die „ . .” His voice trailed off in a 
mumble. r 

“Some of us are dying,” said 
Maher. “But he’s right, Gene; we 
can make it, with luck. We’ll not 
be able to come in fast, nor land in 



the city, but we’ll make it to Earth.” 
“That’s enough,” decided Gene. 
“If we can land near Chicago, I 
think I can manage the rest.” 

They turned to the controls, and 
MacNamara went back to his pile 
room. Once more the ship limped 
on. this time directly toward the 

<* 4 

ball of Earth, looming a scant 
twenty million miles away. 

J T TOOK eight days to come 
within a million miles of their 
goal. Then tragedy struck again. 
The cabin on the passenger deck 
from which they had removed the 
sole survivor blew its door, and the 
air on the deck above rushed out 
through the hole they had burned 
into the cabin. It had been forgot- 
ten, and it meant the lives of three 
more crew members. 

Then, as they prepared to bring 
the ship into the atmosphere, 
Maher, peering through the tele- 
scope, let out a shout. “Company 
ship, coming up fast! They’re after 
us!” 

Gene leaped to the telescope and 
peered through. Far to the left, a 
glowing silver streak in the sky, was 
the familiar shape of a space ship, 
growing larger by the minute. 
Studying it, Gene saw that it was 
an armed cruiser. 

“They’ve got wise,” said Maher. 
“I thought they would, when we 
didn’t check in at Io. Probably 
radioed back to be on the lookout 
for us.” 

“Call MacNamara,” said Gene. 
“We’ve got to see if he can set us 
down faster. Maybe there’s some 
way to step up that pile ” 



Maher rushed off, and Ann came 
in. “What’s up?” she asked. 

“Cruiser after us,” said Gene, 
his face grim. “Looks like we won’t 
get to Chicago unless MacNamara 
has something up that old sleeve of 
his.” 

Ann went white, and together 
they waited for the old Engineer. 

When he came in, Gene gestured 
to the telescope. “Take a look ” 
MacNamara squinted through 
the eyepiece with his double pop- 
eyes. “Don’t see a thing,” he 
grumbled. 

“Well, it’s a Company Cruiser, 
gunned to the limit. She’s going to 
be near enough to shoot us down in 
about three hours.” 

“Three hours, you say?” Mac- 
Namara scratched his head. “How 
near we to Earth?” 

“Half a million miles.” 

“You could make it in die life- 
boat.” 

Gene snorted. “That Cruiser’d 
shoot down the lifeboat as easy as 
it will the ship — a lot easier.” 

“If they can catch you,” said 
MacNamara. “Some of us must die, 
that the rest may live.” 

“Don’t start . that again, Mac,” 
said Maher impatiently. “What we 
want to know' is whether you can 
soup up that pile so we can beat 
that Cruiser do%vn to Earth?” 
“Not a thing I can do,” said the 

Chief Engineer. “We’ve only one 
set of tubes. Full power would 
shoot us all over die sky. But I can 
do something as good” 

“What?” T 

The old Engineer considered 

them through his double eyes. 
“The rest of you’ll take the lifeboat 



and make for Earth. _ I’ll remain 
here on the ship and shield your 
flight. I’m sure I can hide the lit- 
tle boat for awhile, and then, even 
with one jet, I think I can delay 
the cruiser until you get away. 

Someone’s got to make a sacrifice. 
I’m old, and I didn’t want any of 
this to begin with. 

Maher gasped. “Mac, you old 
fool. D’ya mind if I apologize for 
what I just said? But you’re right, 
that’s a possible answer. Only I’ll 
be the one to stay.” 

“Do you know how to adjust the 
pile and the jets to make a weapon 
out of them?” asked MacNamara. 

“No . began Maher. 

MacNamara grinned. “Nor am I 
going to tell you! So, you see, you 
can’t be the one to stav.” 

4 

Maher gripped the old man’s 
hand and pumped it. “You win ” 
he said. “You old . crackpot!” 
There was real affection in his 
voice. 

“Then be off with you,” said the 
Chief Engineer. “You’ve not a min- 
ute to lose. Every man jack of you 
into the boat, including the Cap- 
tain and the Mates. I’ll not have 
my ship cluttered up with extra 
hands that might cramp my 
style. And turning, the old man 
made his way back to the pile room, 
mumbling to himself. 

Eyes wet, Gene gave the orders 
to abandon ship, and within thirty 
minutes every living soul was 
aboard the lifeboat. 

MacNamara had finished his 
work with the pile and was back in 
the control room, waiting for the 
lifeboat to cast off. As it did so, he 
waved, then turned to the controls.

RAY PALMER 



As the lifeboat darted away on 
its chemical jet engines, they could 
see the old man maneuvering the 
big ship so as to keep it ever be- 
tween them and the Cruiser. An 
hour later when they were within a 
hundred thousand miles of Earth, 
MacNamara sent up a flare denot- 
ing surrender. 

Tensely they watched the distant 
speck of light that was the ship 
with MacNamara on , it. Then, 
around its side came the Company 
Cruiser, steering in toward it to 
make the capture. It was scarcely 
a thousand miles from the disabled 
ship. Gradually it drew closer, then 
edged in. Now it was only a few 
miles away, and at this distance, 
both specks seemed to merge., 

“They got him!” Maher said. 

“Yah!” Schwenky boomed, dis- 
appointment in his voice. “Me, I 
should have been the one to stay. I 
would slap them.” 

Suddenly, out in space, a bright 
flower grew. A flower of incan- 
descent light that blossomed with 
terrifying rapidity, until it seemed 
to engulf all space in the area of 
the two ships. The familiar sphere 
of brilliance that marked an ex- 
ploding atom bomb hung there in 
the heavens an instant, then it was 
gone. In its place was only a vast 
cloud of smoke, the dust and scat- 
tered atoms that were all that re- 
mained of two gigantic space ships. 

“He detonated the pile!” said 
Gene. “He turned himself into an 
atom bomb!” 

“Yah!” said Schwenky, his voice 
strangely muted. “Yah!” Awkward- 
ly he turned and patted Ann’s head 

as she began to sob. 



I S IT NOT handsome?” asked 
Schwenky proudly, holding the 
front page of the newspaper up for 
all to see. “I have my picture in 
the paper! Is it not njce?” 

Laughing, Ann kissed the big 
Swede right on the lips, and hugged 
him, paper and ail. “It’s beautiful, 
you big Jug!” she said. “The hand- 
somest picture I’ve ever seen in any 
paper.” 

“Nah!” denied Schwenky. “It is 
not the handsomest. All of us have 
our pictures in the paper. We are 
all very good looking! Not only 
Schwenky. Is it not so. Gene, my 
friend?” 



Gene grinned at him, and at the 
others. Maher pounded him on 
the back, and over the uproar 
came the voice of the editor of the 
Sentinel. “Telephone for Mr. 
Schwenky!” 

Schwenky looked dazed, cocked 
his big ears at the editor. “For 
Schwenky?” he asked stupidly. 
“Telephone? Who would call 
Schwenky on the telephone?” 

“How do I know?” said the edi- 
tor. “It’s some lady . He thrust 
the phone into the big Swede’s 
hand. 

“Lady?” said Schwenky wonder- 
ingly. “Hello , . lady . he spoke 
into the receiver, his booming voice 
making it rattle. 

“The other . ” began Gene, 
then desisted. “Never mind, she’ll 
hear you. 

“What? You want to marry me? 
Lady . ” Schwenky’s eyes bulged 
even more, and he roared into the 
transmitter. “Lady! You wait! I 
come!” He thrust the phone into 
the editor’s hands and made for

the door like a lumbering bull. 

“Where you going?” yelled 

Gene. 

Schwenky halted, turned with a 
big grin. “I go to marry lady. She 
asked me to become my wife!” 

“Where is she?” asked Gene. 
“Where are you going to meet 
her?” 

Schwenky looked stupidly at the 
now silent phone. “By golly! I for- 
get to ask her!” There was tragedy 
in his voice. “Now I never find 
her!” 

Mr 

The editor laughed. “Never 
mind — you’ll get a hundred more 
proposals before the day’s over. 
You can take your pick!” 

Schwenky’ s eyes opened wide. 
Then he grinned again. “Yah!” he 
roared.' “I take my pick! She will 
be beautiful! Yah!” 

The chatter of the teletype in- 
terrupted him, and the editor 
turned to watch the tape as it came 
from the machine. The he began 
to read: 

“Washington. April 23. President 
Walworth has grounded all space- 
ships and ordered all those enroute 
to proceed to the nearest port. A 
Congressional committee has been 
picked, including top members of 
the cabinet, to investigate the ships, 



the atomic drives, and the system 
of secret slavery among crews. In 
a statement to the Press, President 
Walworth said that space travel 
wall not be resumed until proper 
shields are developed. But he added 
that he had been informed by lead- 
ing physicists that the problem can 
be solved within a year if sufficient 
funds were available. Said the 
President: T will see that the funds 
are made available!’ ” 

The editor dropped the tape and 
turned to Gene. “I have one more 
bit of information, this one direct 
from the President by phone. He 
has asked me to inform you that he 
has appointed you new head of 
FAST.” 

“FAST?” asked Gene. “What’s 
that?” 

“Federal Agency for Space 
Travel,” grinned the editor. “And 
congratulations. I hate to lose a 
good reporter, but maybe you’ll be 
back after you finish in Washing- 
ton — at a substantial increase in 
salary.” 

Gene grinned back. “Maybe I 
will,” he said. “And Fll need the 
money.” He put an arm around 
Ann and drew her to him. “Tw’o 
can’t live as ckeap as one, you 
know.” 



THE END 






TUCK ER . His 












ILSON (BOB) TUCKER 



is a very personable young 
man who lives in P.O. Box 702, 
Bloomington, Illinois. Since 1934, 
he has labored mightily and thank- 
lessly to evolve and create the 
"'Science Fiction News Letter.” 
This, according to Bob’s letterhead 
is "the leading newspaper of the 
science fiction world.” 

The first item in the oldest issue 
of this newsletter we have at hand 
(Feb. 1946) reads:

The two items quoted are hot 
necessarily representative of # the 
broader content of Bob TuckeEs 
newsletter. But Bob Tucker is cer- 
tainly representative of that broad 
and interesting brotherhood— the 
science-fiction fan clubs. Even the 
moreso because his newsletter rep 
resents no single club, but caters to 
the many hundreds of them all over 
the world. 

An examination of the letter 
shows it to be neatly almost pro- 
fessionally done. But more tit ah 
this, it shows the heart and sou 
the work and sweat that goes into 
it. Bob’s circulation has risen from 
a handful of giveaways in 
a paid circulation in 195 
copies. This rise is 
live of two factors 
public interest in 
and Tucker’s amazin 
age, or maybe plain 
ness.

First, why do these amateur 
newsmen do it? Why does Bob 
Tucker beat out his brains year 
after year in this strange manner? 
Profit? We are sure this is not the 
case. Tucker's letter is issued bi- 
monthly and sells for 15c a copy. 
He could make more money 're-

Certainly not in the case of Wilson

can be observed unfailingly every 
year in front of a world series 
stadium. 

In case the reader may interpret 
the foregoing as IF’s invitation to 
the fan clubs into a mutual admira- 
tion society, it’s not true, and we 
ask Bob Tucker and his clansmen 
to read further. As an individual, 
we admire them very much, but as 
editor of IF, a magazine dedicated 
to entertainment and thence to a 
publisher’s profit, we can only 
quote the able Sam Merwin who 
bowed out of THRILLING WON- 
DER STORIES’ editorial chair 

with the following comment in the 
October ’5 1 issue of that magazine : 

", . fans as such make up a very 
small percentage of our net paid 
circulation . The magazine is ac- 
hy a much less 
actively zealous and vociferous 
readership. Thus we have given the 
fans space in the deliberate hope 
and intention of making their antics 
entertaining to at least a fair pro- 
portion of the larger, less-fannish 
readership 




PERSONALITIES 

4 

We did not see the foregoing re- 
ported in Tuckers newsletter. An 
oversight no doubt. But Bob cer- 
tainly knows that Sam Merwin is a 
man who — by his own admission — 
considered “the trading of reason- 
ably ingenious insults a delightful 
pastime”. Therefore we think we 
could, with Sam’s consent, substi- 
tute “their affairs interesting” for 
“their antics entertaining” in the 

above quotation. And with the sub- 
stitution we’ve probably quoted 
from Sam, the policy of ninety-nine 
percent of the professional stf mag 
editors, although few of them have 
exhibited either Sam’s courage or 
his desire to give up editing. 

Frankly, we don’t think the fans 
need the pro mags as much as they 
appear to. We feel that if all paper 

supplies were suddenly needed to 
make blotters for the Pentagon 
and the pro mags thus ceased to 
be. Bob Tucker and his science- 
fiction fans would go merrily on 
their way, getting together to dis- 
cuss atom bombs, guided projec- 
tiles, space platforms and other 
things far beyond the layman’s ken.

area in the ceiiter of the ancient 

city, the part considered too dan- 
gerous because of cave-in possibili- 
ties and made its way out to the 

edge of ruins to the part 
that resembled the ancient ceme- 




teries on Earth. The only major 
difference was that there were no 
remains under the evenly spaced 



stones. There was some doubt that 
it had been a cemetery. But the 
guide announced it as one. And 
that announcement as the bus came 



to a stop Had a pronounced effect 
on Herb. He began his Buttery el- 
bow movements again and looked 



afound at Dotty with a triumphant 
smile. I moved up quickly to keep 
him in earshot. 

He protested when George in- 
sisted on taking camera shots, then 
gave in and cooperated in order to 
get it over with. 

Finally George snapped his 
camera shut. Herb mumbled some- 



thing to Dotty that I didn’t catch, 
and started down one of the lanes 
between rows of stones as though 
headed for a definite goal. 

I ebtildrf t very well follow aftef 
they left the main group. It would 
have been obvious. Instead, I 
veered off to one side, gambling 
that when they reached their desti- 
nation I would be able to read their 



lips. 

I got well away from stragglers 
and took out my mifrosebpe, point- 
ing if off in the distance and swing- 
ing the objective lens around until 
it centered on them. I was lucky. 
They were facing in my direction. 

“It isn’t a cemetery,” Herb was 
saying with emphatic motions of his 
hands. “It was a parking area, and 



this stone was where I parked my 
air sled. I can remember it as 
though it were yesterday.” . 

I had to admire the man’s sub- 
conscious. It was a remarkably 
shrewd guess. The experts wouldn’t 
play along with it, but they would 
probably never be able to prove 
him wrong on that count. But Dotty 
was arguing with him. “How can 
you prove it was a parking area?” 
Her eyes roamed over the Jarge 
field with its regularly spaced 
stones. “It certainly looks imprac- 
tical for a parking lot.” 

“Just the same, that’s what it 
was. I wish I had a shovel here. I 
seem to remember burying some- 
thing near my stone. If I could find 
that it would prove I really remem- 
ber.” 

“Why don’t you forget it?” Dotty 
pleaded. “After all, even if it were 
true, **hat docs it matter now ? 33 

“It matters to me. Ever since 
we arrived here I’ve seen familiar 
things. Too familiar to be coinci- 
dence. I never felt this way before. 
I always considered reincarnation 
as ancient superstitious belief, just 
like everyone else. But not any 
more. I know. I lived here when all 
this was new.” 

“But can’t you just be satisfied to 
feel that you did and let it go at 
that?” Dotty asked. “I’m afraid of 
what they would do- to you if they 
found out what you’re thinking.” 

“Hah!” Herb snorted. “I have a

The guide was calling everyone 
back to- the bus. I watched Herb 
scowl fiercely at the stone marker 
that he believed to have been his, 
open Tis mouth to say something, 
then turn away so- that his lips were 
out of sight. Regretfully I put the 
mirroscope away and went back to 

the bus. 



I" KNEW WHERE we were go- 
JL mg next, and I was uneasy 
about it. Herb and Dotty managed 
to sit together and I got a place 
right behind them where I could 
eavesdrop. Rut they sat in silence. 

The bus had left the ancient city 
behind, to head out over the desert 
toward one of the few structures on 
Mars which had withstood the rav- 
ages of time without crumbling. An

Two of the permanent guards* 
had come out to take charge of the 
tour. I caught the eye of ode of 
them and nodded toward Herb. 
The guard caught my meamfig, 
edged over to his partner, and soon 
both men were warned that Herb 
was to be closely watched. 

I felt better, knowing that a cou- 
ple of others knew about him. May- 
be it would have been smarter to 
have taken him in .custody right 
then. But it would have meant a 
scene. 

The procedure of the tour was 
for the guide to do all the talking, 
leading the procession through the 
roped off parts of the dome, while 
the two guards followed along be-

reluctantly, I put it back. I would 
have to play the part. The paralysis 
tube would give me away as an 
agent It would have to be up to 
Steve and the others to contain the 
threat. 

Down in the lobby I saw Steve 
waiting impatiently. He was un- 
easy, too. “What’s come over C.I.?” 
They’re toying with dynamite on 
this.’* 

“I think I know what they 
want, they want to let him go far 
enough so we can see more of the 
nature of the danger. And I hope 
nobody gets killed. They should 
have spotted this Herb guy and not 
let him come here at all. I suspect 
they did spot him, and let him come 
to conduct another of their damned 
experiments. They don’t want to 
leave well enough alone.” 

We were outside now. No one 
was around. The sun was just be- 
ginning to set, and the instant it 
disappeared the night would be 
pitch-black. Even if one of the 
moons was out / 

“We’ll be watching on the stand- 
ard C.L band,” Steve assured me. 
“They’re at the temple right now, 
waiting for it to get dark.” He 
grinned. “Good luck.” There was a 
mixture of genuineness, half mctck- 
ery, and worry in his voice. 

At the temple ruins I found them 
easily enough and took the simplest 
course. I walked right up to them. 

“Hello,” I said. “I thought I’d 
find you here. I want to go along 
with you. I’m interested.” 

“What do you mean?” Herb was 
hostile and suspicious. 

“You remember me. I was on the 
tour this afternoon. I accidentally* 



overheard you. It would he some- 
thing if reincarnation could be 
proven.” 

“Do you believe in reincarna- 
tion?” 5 

I frowned as though being cau- 
tious. “I don't know.” Then I put a 
disarming grin on my lips. “Since 
believing in it is legally classified as 
insanity, for the records, no.” It 
was a nice statement. It could im- 
ply that I did, and Herb took that 
implication. He accepted me. Dotty 
was different. 

“How do you know he isn’t an 
agent?” she asked Herb uneasily. 

“If I am. the fat’s in the fire,” I 
told her. “but wouldn’t I be lock- 
ing him up?” This quieted, but 
didn’t satisfy her. “Anyway,” I said, 
“if you can dig up something that 
you remember burying, an extra 
witness won’t do any harm. That’s 
what you’re after, isn’t it? Proof 
that will end the last bit of doubt?” 

“That’s right,” Herb said. “And 
you can help me dig.” 

“Okay then,” I said. And it was 
settled. We introduced ourselves, 
then lapsed into silence while we 
waited for the sun to set. It wasn’t 
long. 

T HE PLAGE looked more like 
a cemetery than ever in the 
eerie glow of black light pencils as 
we made our way along a row of 
stone markers. Herb strode pur- 
posefully. Dotty stuck close to him, 
still a little suspicious of me. I 
trailed half a step behind. 

Finally Herb stopped beside one 
of the markers. “This is it,” he said 
softly. I blinked at the marker* then

ing. After a reasonable amount of 
this Herb stood up with a resigned 
sigh. “Guess i was wrong, 1 ” he said. 

“Poor Herby,” Dotty said. 

“Yeah, poor Herby,” Herb said 
with every appearance of tiredness 
and defeat. “But — that’s that. 
Sorry to have gotten you all excited 
about nothing, Joe. Guess it was 
too much to expect anything.” He 
turned to Dotty. “As long as we’re 
out here, let’s take a walk by our- 
selves. Huh?” 

That was as obvious a cue as I 
had ever been handed. Neat. I was 
confronted with the alternatives of 
scramming or calling him a liar. 

“Guess I might as well go back 
to the hotel,” I said ^ cheerfully. 
“See you in the morning.” 

I headed back the way we had 
corne until I was sure they couldn’t 
hear me or see me with their black 
light pencils. Then, ducking down 
next to a marker I waited. After a 
couple of minutes I heard cautious 
foosteps. 

■TPs me, joe — Steve.” 

“Good,” I grunted. “What are 
they doing now? They gave me the 
brush-off.” 

“I got the play,” Steve said. 
“Slick. Should we close in now, or 

wait?” 



"I think I’ll play my part a lit-* 
tie fur ther. Don’t want G.I. to 
think we’re timid.” 

“Okay,” Steve said. “The next 
funeral we attend may be our 

own.” 

“Yeah ” I said. “It might.” 

I moved into the darkness, not 
using my black light pencil, but 
keeping my sensitized glasses on so 
I could see Herb’s if I got close 
enough. 

I reached the spot where we had 
done the digging. I hesitated, then 
kept on, toward the spot where 
Herb and Dotty had been so en- 
grossed that afternoon. In my 
mind’s eye I knew exactly where 
it was. 

My hands explored ahead of me, 
searching out each stone marker 
along my path, dinging to it as I 
passed it, and slipping off as I went 
on to the next. They were my only 
contact with reality in this total 
blackness. 

I was thinking, too. I was think- 
ing of what Herb had said about 
this being a parking area for air- 
sleds back before the earliest known 
records of man on Earth when this 

_ f 

city was alive. He was probably 
right about it at that. Analysis had 
shown the presence of copper and 
aluminum in the top surface of 
some of the markers that could 
only be accounted for by some 
metallic object setting atop each 
one long ago, and remaining so that 
molecular and atomic creep could 
set in, carrying such atoms deep 
into the surface crystals of the 
stone. 

And I was wondering what it 
was he hoped to dig up. If it were 




f 



THE OLD MARTIANS 



some sort of weapon it probably 
wouldn’t work after all this time. It 
couldn’t! Or could it? A few things 
had been pieced together about the 
ancient Martian civilization. Not 
much, but enough to be sure that 
they knew a„few things we had 
never discovered. They had been 
masters at creating machines with 
no moving parts. The electronic 
devices we had found had proven 
they knew far more about V.H.F. 
than wc did. 

I could see what G.l. was aim- 
ing at now. We might not even 
recognize what Herb was search- 
ing for. It would be better to let 
him find it, and get it from him be- 
fore he could use it. If it was a 
weapon. 

'And it probably was a weapon. I 
was pretty sure his main objective 
was hidden in the wall in the dome, 
and that tills thing in the cemetery 
was something that would help 
him get to that abjective. 

My thoughts came back to my 
surroundings. I was less than a 
dozen feet from where Herb and 
Dotty should be. I stopped. There 
was no trace of black light. I held 
xnf breath and listened. And I 
heard the faint scraping of the 
knife against stone. • 

{ WISHED fervently that I had a 
standard C.I. infrascope so that 
I could see. Steve probably knew 
more of what was going on than I 
did. I had counted on watching 
Herb by his own black light pencil, 
and he was working in darkness. 

Carefully I stole forward, inch 
by slow inch, my ears tuned for. the 



faintest significant sound such as a 
grunt of satisfaction that would tell 
of finding what he was digging for. 

And a million thoughts taunted 
me, thoughts about the latest dis- 
coveries in disintegration frequen- 
cies, thoughts about how little we 
knew of that ancient Martian civ- 
ilization. 

But also I was figuring what 
Herb would do. He would find the 
object he was digging for. Unwit- 
tingly he would grunt his triumph. 
Dotty might forget his strict warn- 
ings to be quiet, and say something. 
Regardless of that, he would stand 
up slowly, fondling what he had 
found, remembering what it was 
and how it worked. There would 
be a few seconds before it would 
become a weapon in his hands, sec- 
onds that I had to make the most 
use of, and be ready for. 

c *Uh!” It was the triumphant 
grunt I had known would come. 

Sudden panic made me cast 
aside whatever vague plan of ac- 
tion I had had. 

I turned on my pencil, bathing 
the two in its black light. At the 
same time I said, “I thought it was 

a scheme to get rid of me.” 

It was the element of surprise 
that saved me. A still picture of the 
scene the black light disclosed 
etched itself into my mind. There 
was an object in Herb’s hand. A 
strange, meaningless object, dirty, 
yet with definite form. It was 
cradled in his hand like a weapon. 
It was pointed almost at me. 

I dropped my pencil and went 
in low, diving for his legs. I felt the 
air crackle where I had just stood. 
As my antis encircled his legs I 




146 



heard thunder exploding nearby. 

Training has its advantages. The 
moment I felt contact with Herb 
that training took over. I jerked 
and rolled in a movement calcu- 
lated to throw him to the ground 
face down, the motion ending in a 
backbreaker hold. 

But only a part of my mind was 
concerned with that. The other 
part was frozen with horror. Ap- 
proximately a half acre of the 
cemetery was glowing. I saw Steve 
in the center of it with Herb’s 
weapon pointing his way. The very 
inertia of matter held Steve to- 
gether for that brief instant, then 
he was falling apart, melting and 
evaporating at the same time, just 
like the stone markers and the 
ground around him. 

I had the thing away from him 
suddenly, and 1 wondered what to 
do next. Running footsteps gave 
me the answer. It was other C.I. 
agents closing in. 

Seconds later they had Herb un- 
der control. Dotty was wringing 
her hands and crying. 

Me, I was holding the tiling, 
afraid to let go of it and afraid to 
keep on holding it. But as the sec- 
onds passed without it exploding 
into destructive action again I be- 
gan to let myself think I might live 
a while longer. 

The area of destruction was 
molten now. Its heat was like that 
of an open blast furnace. 

We skirted it and headed toward 
the road, lights in the distance tell- 
ing us that cars were on the way to 
get us, 

I saw Dotty stumble. I took her 

arm. , She looked up at me, recog- 



ROG PHILLIPS 

nized me in the light from the 
glowing pool of bubbling lava, and 
tried to pull away. 

“Take it easy,” I said gruffly. 
c Tm your friend. Maybe the only 
friend you’ve got here.” 

Her look told me she didn’t be- 

d r 

lieve me, but she didn’t pull away 
any more. 

We walked along, and after a 
moment she seemed to struggle up 
out of her mental paralysis. 

“Herb was right!” she said in a 
low, wondering tone. “He really 
did remember.” 

“It -was plain coincidence,” I 
said sharply, “and don’t ever let 
yourself think differently. He’s in- 
sane. It’s a recognized form of in- 
sanity. He’ll be sent to a good men- 
tal hospital, and in a year or two 
he’ll come out good as new.” 

“Coincidence?” she echoed. 
Then she laughed. It was mirth 
that drifted quickly into hysterical 
hopelessness. 1 dug my fingers into 
her flesh until the pain brought her 
to her senses. 

“Coincidence,” I said. “Nothing 
more. I’ve seen seventeen cases just 
like his. How else did I spot him? I 
recognized the type. None of the 
others found what they rational- 
ized themselves into thinking they 
remembered from the time they 
were Martians. Eventually one of 
them would stumble onto some- 
thing. That’s coincidence. Not in- 
carnated memory.” 

She turned her head and blinked 
at me. I nodded grimly. “I’m an 
agent,” I said. “I go out on the 
tours for one purpose only— to spot 
psychos and make sure they don’t 
get out of control You’d he sur- 




THE OLD MARTIANS 

prised how many there are. Some 
of them, like your husband, prob- 
ably show no sign of instability un- 
til they get here. They look around 
at the evidence of a civilization 
that existed before homo sapiens 
had evolved on the Earth, and it 
thtows them. If you want to un- 
derstand more about it read the 
medical books. They get irrational 
pre-memories. They look at some- 
thing and the idea of familiarity 
associates with the new impression. 
They look around a corner and see 
something, and build up the con- 
viction that they had consciously 
known what was there before they 
looked around the corner.” 

I felt that I was making head- 
way with her. I wanted to. I had to. 

I 

“You — you say there were oth- 
ers, and they didn’t find any- 
thing?” she said. She was groping 
for something logical to grasp. I 
had to give bet that something. 

“That’s right,” I said. “And the 
law of averages said that someday 
someone would uncover something 
that’s been missed.” 

She was nodding slowly now, ac- 
cepting what I was saying. It was 
authoritative. She would find com 
firm a,t ion in authoritative books. If 
she wanted to pursue the subject 
she would find plenty of evidence, 
real evidence, to support it. It is a 
common form of insanity. It was 
important that she believe that. 

We reached the road. C.I. had 

been prepared. There was a car to 
take her back to the hotel, a sta- 
tionwagon for Herb who was now 
very, submissive and somewhat 
dazed, and a third car for me and 





EN MINUTES later I was in 
the Science Building ba.seineiit, 
laying the thing on a wooden table, 
very gently. It seemed solid, each 
integral part of its form being of a 
different metal. 

None of the men watching me 
lay it down discounted the danger 
it contained. They knew too much 
about how shape and dimension 
can affect the electronic properties 
of metal. They knew the thing 
probably didn’t contain an erg of 
power of its own, but probably trig- 
gered and directed the release of 
cosmic energies as yet unknown to 
them. 

They stared at it. One of them 
reached out to touch it, then slowly 
drew his finger back. 

I could see the decision crystalliz- 
ing in their minds behind their 
serious eyes. This thing would go 
with the other strange and incom- 
prehensible machines locked in 
vaults in a concrete building far 
out oh the Martian desert away 
from the tourist trails of this dead 
planet. It would remain there un- 
til the day when human science ad- 
vanced far enough to understand it. 

“What about the wall in the 
dome?” I asked. 

“They roped it off. They’re 
afraid of it.” 

“Did you convince his wife he’s 
insane ? 59 one of the science staff 
asked. 

I nodded. “I used the same old 
line. Told her there were dozens 
like him, and the law of averages 
made it certain at least one of diem 
would find something.” 

He nodded, grinned without hu- 
mor. “How we love to lie.”

I turned awav. There was a bit- 
ter taste in my mouth from all the 
lies Pd told — all the bilge. 

But I knew the truth, too. I was 
as sure of that as I was of any- 
thing. It wasn’t insanity, of course. 
And it wasn’t reincarnation. It 
seemed to be, because the mind 
has a habit of possessing for its 
very own anything that enters it. 

The truth of the matter was that 
somehow, in some incomprehen- 
sible way, the Martians were still 
with us. They hated us and they 
knew how to use our weak ones. 

The old Martians — and their 
science.' 

I took a last look at the weapon 
lying on the table, then left the 
room and climbed the stairs to the 



first floor, I walked down the silent, 
empty hall to the exit and out into 
the night. 

I let my eyes roam the blackness 
Aof the lifeless Martian desert. With 
an effort I pulled them away and 
fixed them on the warmth, the hu- 
man warmth, beckoning from the 
hotel. 

I started walking toward that bit 
of comfort, and as I walked the 
eternal question that haunted all of 
us in C.I, hovered in the back- 
ground of my thoughts. 

Would we be able to contain the 
Martiaps until we understood the 
terrible machines they had left as 
a deadly heritage? 

Tonight we almost hadn’t. .. 

I thought of Steve.

to prosper. Peace could only be ob- 
tained the price of conquest. 

Should your enemy be infringing 
on your trade, you do not destroy 
him utterly. You just try to break 
him down to your size, or a little 
beiow. You therefore not only make 
his markets open to you, but you 
make him one of your markets. 
Should lie have an eye on a bit of 
territory that will give him an ad- 
vantage over you, then you try to 
annex it first. You don’t wash it 
right off the map, for if it will give 
him an advantage, it will give you 
one also — no matter how many 
excuses of liberation are made. 
That liberation yarn was one of 
Hitler’s most-played records, and 
Joe is running him pretty close! In 
fairness, it must be admitted that 
we have our own version of the 
same story. 

It follows that internal use of the 
atom-bomb, except for race suicide, 
is not likely- — when everyone can 
use it. And it is probable that most 
of the leading figures in today’s 
scene could put on a very nice dis- 
play of atomic fireworks. Each race, 
creed, or nation, does not desire to 
. utterly destroy their enemies. They 
just desire an advantage — eco- 
nomic — over the rest. No advan- 
tage can be had when the others 
cease to exist. Although it may be 
nice politics to demand the use of 
the atom-bomb when you are not 
in favour of the present govern- 
ment, or administration is not like- 
ly that such demands are made 
seriously — except in the public eye. 
If it were not that the public 
thought the use of the atom-bomb 
would be a decisive factor, the 



opposition would equally likely 
be expressing a strong desire that 
the government should refrain from 
its use. 



T HE SAME reasoning— which 
is doubtless considered falla- 
cious by many of my readers- — 
tends to me to prove the use of the 
atom-bomb and the planet-smasher 
improbable in space-war. (As an 
aside, I consider space-war, as nor- 
mally visualised, highly unlikely 
anyway. Anyone who has had much 
to do with the supply lines for a 
military campaign wall realise what 
I mean ) . 

Frankly, you may consider this 
editorial to be an iniquitous vilifica- 
tion of mankind. It is not meant to 
be. It is intended to show that man, 
in the main, does things because 
he hopes to get something out of it. 
You get. very little out of total 
devastation, if you are anywhere 
near the norm. The atom-bomb, 
fission-type, has been used twice, 
and although it’s destructive pow- 
ers did not quite match up to the 
science-fiction fan’s expectations, it 
was enough of a holocaust to shock 
most humans. The fusion-type we 
expect to be far 'worse. I do not ex- 
pect them to be used to any great 
extent in the future — and I base 
my hope and expectation on man’s 
very obvious cupidity! If that 
doesn’t save us, nothing will! 

And, naturally, if it saves us long 
enough to permit us to get out into 
space, it will probably save all 
those planets that our authors of to- 
day so happily blast from their 
orbits into flaming; death. — kfs

Phosphorescent Muscles 

I t is strange to consider the way 
in which altogether diverse sci- 
entific discoveries often dovetail. 
The old saying should be, “Science 
makes strange bedfellows! Biolo- 
gists have for a long time been in- 
terested in the phenomenon of nat- 
ural phosphorescence as exhibited 
by fireflies, deep-sea creatures and 
small animalcules found in fresh 
water. The mechanism all three 
types of life employ to change 
chemical energy into visible light 
is marvellously efficient. Practically 
no energy is lost in heat — -merely a 
fraction ©f one percent — the rest 
appearing as useful light. 

One of the major objectives of 
the study of phosphorescence in 
fireflies was the acquisition of 
knowledge of the mechanism in or- 
der to improve upon the efficiency 
of fluorescent lamps and glow 
tubes. This study is still going on. 

But what is unique is that the 
scientists concerned are beginning 
to suspect that there is a link be- 
tween the way phosphorescence oc- 
curs in living things and the way 
human muscles are triggered into 
action! Imagine the strange con- 
nection between these two (puta- 
tively) unrelated phenomena! It 



made in one branch of science will 
apply to another, entirely dis- 
similar, field. 

The study of the way the mus- 
cles act is of fundamental impor- 
tance to anyone desiring any un- 
derstanding of the life processes at 
all. Scientists have so far begun to 
get the glimmer of an idea as to 
how nerve actions are basically 
electrical, but the step from nerve 
impulse to muscle reaction has been 
a stumbling block for a long time. 
Now it appears that the study of 
fireflies is likely to suggest a lead 
to the right path. 



Insect World Can't Win 

T hat grimly poetic person who 
had “the insect crawling out 
of the eye-socket of the skull Of 
the last man on Earth*’ will have 
to change his tune soon. In the 
never-ending war between men and 
insects, it appears at last as though 
man is to get the upper hand. The 
insect world has countless numbers 
of soldiers, but the human world 
has brains. 

There is a famous laboratory in 
California devoted to one subject- 
insects! It is small and under- 



ofteh happens that a discovery staffed, but it is efficient, and froth 

153 



154 

it have come a number of discov- 
eries that will eventually influence 
all of our lives. Few pe'ople realize 
the destructiveness of insect pests. 
Hundreds of millions of dollars 5 
damage are done each year by in- 
sects to crops, textiles, even metals. 
And until the Berkeley Laboratory 
started a truly scientific campaign, 
all the chemical agents in the world 
were able to do no more than check 
their ravages. 

The Berkeley Laboratory is dedi- 
cated to the study of insect diseases. 
Insects, even as you and I, have a 
ferocious enemy in fungi aqd bac- 
terial destroyers. Farmers, agrono- 
mists and scientists from all over 
the world have sent dead insects to 
Berkeley to determine what killed 
them. Frequently the lab is able to 
pinpoint the killer and very often 
it turns out to be a bacterium of 
some type or another. Fortunately 
the bacterial diseases that seem to 
destroy insects are not harmful to 
humans or animals — and vice 
versa. 

This naturally led the lab men 
to consider wiping out insect pests 
with BW — bacterial warfare. They 
first fought the alfalfa caterpillar 
with a filterable virus suspended in 
water and sprayed from an air- 
plane. The results were- perfect and 
the caterpillars were wiped out in 
one fell swoop. 

Subsequent work has shown that 
viruses of various types are even 
more effective than bactericidal 
componds and, as a consequence, 
the electron microscope, the only 
medium through which viruses can 
be seen, is in constant use. Large 
varieties of viral substances have 
been discovered which are able to 



CHARLES RECOUR 

deplete the insect world, and right 
now a planned program is in prog- 
ress, designed to practically label 
some virus as a destroyer for some 
insect type, definitely and specifi- 
cally. 

The success of this program will 
be a great boon to farmers, bee- 
keepers, plant and animal breeders, 
and even to householders. While in 
reality the threat of insect domina- 
tion has always been very slight, 
tlie actual damage done by the 
creatures has been formidable. 
Chemicals have limited applica- 
tion and the best bet would seem 
to be to fight living fire with living 
fire — use harmless viruses to com- 
bat fearful insects. 

Science is gradually turning 
from the manipulation of the physi- 
cal environment, the inorganic, to 
the organic. In the biological world 
rather than the physical are the 
greatest chances for new and ex- 
treme advances. And BW against 
insects is one of the outstanding 
new victories !

tween the remotest stars and gal- 
axies, you think of frightening 
emptiness, of sheer nothingness, 
awesome in its lack of matter. This 
is not exactly the case. So-called 
“empty space 55 is actually filled al- 
most uniformly with vast amounts 
of plain old hydrogen gas. Near 
stars this gas is ionized, electrically' 
charged, and can be detected by 
ordinary telescopic and spectro- 
scopic. observation. But neutral, un- 




SCIENCE BRIEFS

charged hydrogen cannot be de* 
tec ted this way. 

It took the new science of “radio 
astronomy** to show up the star- 
tling amounts of hydrogen present 
everywhere. First, neutral hydrogen 
makes its presence known by the 
unusual fact that every once in a 
while the electron spin of a single 
atom of .hydrogen will be com- 
pletely reversed, and thus it will 
send out a feeble pulse of radiation 
— not visible light, but the subtler 
radiation of familiar radio waves. 
Because this pulse is exceedingly 
weak, and because it occurs with 
such rarity in the life of a single 
hydrogen atom, there would be no 
hope at all of ever detecting it if 
it were not for the astounding fact 
that hydrogen is abundant beyond 
all expectation, m 

In. a universe measured in hun- 
dreds of millions of light years in 
diameter, it is known that there 
is approximately one atom of hy- 
drogen for every' cubic centimeter 
of space! This fantastic density ex- 
plains why radio astronomy in 
this region works. Rarely does a 
single hydrogen atom pulse out a 
blast of radiation, but when count- 
less numbers of atoms are involved, 
they all add up to an appreciable 
amount of radiation. 

Huge receptive directional an- 
tennas poke their grotesque shapes 
into the sky and, with highly sensi- 
tive fingers, pick up the twenty- 
one-centimeter radiation that 
touches their sensitivity. Radio 
astronomy is now able to make 
charts and graphs of the radiation 
distribution. What it means is an- 
other matter. What part it plays in 
the structure of the universe is not 




fully known but, as has been men- 
tioned before, it is very’ likely that 
these enormous numbers of hydro- 
gen atoms provide the fuel for 
warming the stars, and serve as a 
vast “coalpile” for the stellar fur- 
naces. It is this discovery which 
leads scientists to think that the 
universe is not dying, but rather is 
in a continual state of creative flux, 
renewing itself and regenerating it- 
self without end. 

Of course much more will be 
learned of these things as soon as 
Man can get out of the hampering 
blanket of air that interferes with 
such research and analysis. A 
Lunar observatory would be the 
thing that the average radio as- 
tronomer would sell his soul for for, 
without a three-hundred -mile blan- 
ket of air to soak off the radio 
Waves before they touch his an- 
tenna* he’d be able to tell a great 
deal more about what is happening 
a few hundred million light years 
away ! 



Architecture — 2000 





A acinTECTURALLY speaking, peo- 
jT\ pie are just emerging 
the Dark Ages! That 
is a little strong and exaggerated, 
but it must be remembered that, a 
mere twenty years ago, the height 
of architectural style was the imita- 
tion of Gothic horrors, or the dupli- 
cation of the “California-Spanish 55 
bungalow! 

Fortunately there has been a 
widespread increase in good taste 
stimulated by the superb desi; 

are cn

beauty and utility without being 
imitative. 

, The use of materials such as 
glass and new synthetic media 
along with stainless metals and the 

combining of such structures into a 
natural relationship with their sur- 
roundings lead us to suspect that 
here is a glowing future in store 
for architecture. We can’t extrapo- 
late architectural designs to the 
year 2000 but we can certainly 
visualize the trend they are taking 
and from that deduce that certain 
principles will be applied by future 
architects. The spreading-out of 
communities is a certainty. People 
will want then, as now, -to take ad- 
vantage of space and mobility. The 
skyscraper (which is now slowly 
dying as an architectural style) 
may have a new lease on life 
through the development of the 
helicopter and the wider use « of fly- 
ing and moving in three dimensions 



CHARLES RECOUR 

which will be a surety of the time. 

As far as materials go, we can 
only suggest that 2000 will have 
many as yet undreamed of by us. 
For example, it is almost a certainty 
that glass piping will be as common 
then as are iron and copper now. 
Many automatic machines just sug- 
gested now will be in use in both 
country life and city life. 

We may get some minor glimpse 

of what the future will be like by 
examining certain fine specimens of 
contemporary Californian architec- 
ture in which full use is made of the 
idea of relating outdoors to indoors 
in one complete “living-unit”. Peo- 
ple living in places like these are in 
harmony with their environment. 
Nature and Man have combined 
forces. The year 2000 will see 
plenty of that, for by then Nature 

will have been completely tamed 
and function and aesthetics will be 
one. — Charles Recour

THE QUESTION an author 
hears again and again is “Where 
do you get youf plots?” Most au- 
thors, in self-defense have a stock 
answer they can toss of! subcon- 
sciously, but we’ve yet to hear one 
of these answers which is the least 
bit enlightening. 

Thinking in this vein, it occurred 
to us that a writer’s correspondence 
concerning a current brain-child 
might throw at least a dim light on 
the subject. So here’s a peek at 
some author-letters the postman 
brought us: 

Take the note we received from 
Ted Sturgeon who wrote “Never 
Underestimate.” A story, inciden- 
tally, which has already been 
snapped up for a coming anthology. 
Ted writes: 

“The basic idea for this storv 
was an extension of known ideas — 
extrapolation— the choice of a sol- 
idly based scientific or social phe- 
nomena and a series of human 
narratives about their develop- 
ment. The electric motor evolves 
into the cyclotron which, logically, 
should produce an electron accel- 
erator which operates in a straight 
line instead of a circle. Which is, 
of course, a driv^ for a space ship. 



Analytical chemistry has succeeded 
in synthesizing proteins, which logi- 
cally leads to the creation of life 
in the laboratory and the evolution 
of man-made species suited to set- 
tle the outer planets.” 

★ 

WELL, LET’S see what Ray 
(The Hell Ship) Palmer has to 
say about it : 

“Here it is. I think you will 
like it. 

“Keep every story tense with ac- 
tion and human interest and good 
characters the reader can believe in 
and you will keep him on the edge 
of his chair and safely in your 
hands, as a customer. He wants 
thrills and excitement. Strange 
things. Other worlds.” 

Thus writes one of the acknowl- 
edged masters in the field. And so 
well put that we arc allowing Ray’s 
plug for his own mag, OTHER 
WORLDS, to stand. 

Howard Browne, whose Twelve 
Times Zero left us a trifle breath- 
less, wrote: 

“I’ve always wanted to put a 
modern cop into a situation where- 
by he is forced to cope with pure 
science-fiction with only his wits 
and native shrewdness to fall back 
on. I’ll start the story immediately 
and Til be just as interested as any- 
one else in finding out what hap- 
pens to him ” 

Incidentally, the conversation 
from which we quoted iit our edi- 
torial came * at a later date after 
Howard’s plot was prfcttv well 
formed. 








158 

AND NOW a word from the 
fabulous Rog Phillips, author of 
The Old Martians, Rog wrote: 

“1 hope you'll like this one, Paul. 
It’s somewhat of an experiment. I 
tried to do a problem- story with 
three possible solutions, any one of 
which the reader may take as his 
town. I hope I succeeded. If you 
don't feel that I did, please, by all 
means, shoot the yarn back.” 

We should be so foolish! 

So there you have it. The inside 
dope right from the authors them- 
selves.
