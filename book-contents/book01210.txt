Once upon a time, after the Ancient 
Wars, when the Earth slumbered 



Above all, as she began to awaken, she wished for her family. She 
called to them, “Mutti, Vati, Carlotta, Karla! Where are you?” But of 
course she cried it in German since she was a good Prussian girl. Then 
she remembered. 

How long had it been since her father had put her and her two sisters 
into the space capsules? She had no idea. Even her father, the Ritter 
vom Acht, and her uncle. Professor Doctor Joachim vom Acht — who had 
administered the shots in Parbudice, Germany, on April 2, 1945 — could 
not have imagined that the girls would remain in suspended animation 



for thousands of years. But so it was. 

TERNOON SUNLIGHT gleamed 
orange and gold on the rich puiple 
shades of the Fighting Trees. Charls 
looked at the trees, knowing, that as 
the sunset moved from orange to 
red and as darkness crept over the 
eastern horizon, they would once 
again glow with quiet fire. 

How long was it since the trees 
were planted — Fighting Trees, the 
True Men called them — for the ex- 
press purpose of sending their im- 
mense roots down into the earth, 
seeking out the radioactives in the 
soil and the waters beneath, concen- 
trating the poisonous wastes into 
their hard pods, then dropping the 
waxy pods until, at some later time, 
the waters which came from above 
the earth, and those yet in the fearth, 
would once more be clean? Charls 
did not know. 

One thing he did know. To touch 
one of the trees, to touch it directly, 
was certain death. 

He wanted very much to break a 
twig but he did not dare. Not only 



was it tambu, but he feared the 
sickness. His people had made 
much progress in the last few gen- 
erations, enough so that at times 
they did not fear to face True Men 
and to argue with them. But the 
sickness was not something with 
which one could argue. 

At the thought of a True Man, an 
unaccountable thickness gripped 
him in the throat. He felt sentimen- 
tal, tender, fearful; the yearning that 
gripped him was a kind of love, and 
yet he knew that it could not be 
love since he had never seen a True 
Man except at a distance. 

Why, Charls wondered, was he 
thinking so much about True Men? 
Was there, perhaps, one nearby? 

He looked at the setting sun, 
which was by now red enough to be 
looked at safely. Something in the 
atmosphere was making him un- 
easy. He called to his sister. 

“Oda, Oda!” 

She did not answer. 

Again he called. “Oda, Oda!” 




the queen of THE AFTERNOON 



5 




This time he heard her coming, 
ploughing recklessly through the 
underbrush. He hoped she would 
remember to avoid the Fighting 
Trees. Oda was sometimes too im- 
patient. 

Suddenly there she was before 
him. 

“You called me, Charls? You 
called me? You’ve found some- 
thing? Shall we go somewhere to- 
gether? What do you want? Where 
are mother and father?” 

Charls could not help laughing. 
Oda was always like that. 

“One question at a time, little 
sister. Weren’t you afraid you 
would die the burning death, going 
through the trees like that? I know 
you don’t want to believe in the 
tambu, but the sickness is real.” 

“It isn’t,” she said. She shook 
her head. “Maybe it was 
once ... I guess it really was 
once,” granting him a concession, 
“but do you, yourself, know of 
anybody who has died from the 
trees fora thousand years?” 

“Of course not, silly. I haven’t 
been alive a thousand years.” 

Oda’s impatience returned. “You 
know what I mean. And anyway, I 
decided the whole thing is silly. We 
all accidentally brush against the 
trees. So one day I ale a pod. And 
nothing happened.” 

He was appalled. “You ate a 
pod?” 

“That’s what I said. And nothing 
happened.” 

“Oda, one of these days you’re 
going to go too far.” 

She smiled at him. “And now I 
suppose you are going to say that 
the oceans’ beds were not always 
filled with grass.” 

6 



He was indignant. “No, of course 
1 know better than that. I know that 
the grass was put into the oceans 
for the same reason that the Fight- 
ing Trees were planted — to eat up 
all the poisons that the Old Ones 
left in the days of the Ancient 
Wars.” 

How long they would have bick- 
ered he did not know, but just then 
his ears caught an unfamiliar noise. 
He knew the sound the True Men 
made as they sped on their mysteri- 
ous errands in the upper air. He 
knew the ominous buzz that the 
Cities gave off should he approach 
them too closely. He knew also the 
clicking noises that the few remain- 
ing manshonyaggers made as they 
crept through the Wild, alert for any 
non-German to kill. Poor blind 
machines, they were so easy to out- 
smart. 

But this noise, this noise was dif- 
ferent. It was nothing he had ever 
heard before. 

The whistling sound rose and 
throbbed against the upper reaches 
of his hearing. It had a curiously 
spiral quality about it as though it 
approached and receded, all the 
while veering toward him. Charls 
was filled with terror, feeling 
threatened beyond all understand- 
ing. 

Now Oda heard it too. Their quar- 
rel forgotten, she seized his arm. 
“What is it, Charls? What could it 
be?” 

His voice was hesitant and full of 
wonder. “I don’t know.” 

“Are the True Men doing some- 
thing, something new that we never 
heard before? Do they want to hurt 
us, or enslave us? Do they want to 
catch us? Do we want to be caught? 

GALAXY 




Charls, tell me, do we want to be 
caught? Could it be the True Men 
coming? I seem to smell True Man. 
They did come once before and 
caught some of us and took them 
away and did strange things to 
them, so that they looked like True 
Men, didn’t they, Charls? Could it 
be the True Men again?” 

In spite of his fear, Charls had a 
certain amount of impatience with 
Oda. She talked so much. 

The noise persisted and inten- 
sified. Charls sensed that it was di- 
rectly over his head, but he could 
see nothing. 

Oda said, ‘‘Charls, I think I see 
it. Do you see it, Charls?” 

Suddenly he too saw the 
circle — a dim whiteness, a vapor 
train that increased in size and vol- 
ume. Concomitantly the sound in- 
creased, until he felt his eardrums 
would burst. It was nothing ever be- 
fore seen in his world. 

A thought struck him. It was as 
hard as a physical blow; it sapped 
his courage and manhood as nothing 
before had ever done; he did not 
feel young and strong any more. He 
could hardly frame his words. 

‘‘Oda, could that be — ” 

‘‘Be what?” 

‘‘Could it be one of the old, old 
weapons from the Ancient Past? 
Could it be coming back to destroy 
us all, as the legends have always 
foretold? People have always said 
they would come back. ...” His 
voice trailed off. 

Whatever the danger, he knew 
that he was completely helpless, 
helpless to protect himself, helpless 
to protect Oda. 

Against the ancient weapons there 
was no defense. This place was no 



safer than that place, that place no 
better than this. People still had to 
live their lives under the threat of 
weapons from long, long ago. This 
was the first time that he personally 
had met the threat, but he had heard 
of it. He reached for Oda’s hand. 

Oda, singularly courageous now 
that there was real danger, drew 
him over onto the bank, away from 
the cenote. With half his mind he 
wondered why she seemed to want 
to move away from the water. She 
tugged at his arm, and he sat down 
beside her. 

Already, he knew, it was too late 
to go looking for their parents or 
others of their pack. Sometimes it 
took a whole day to round up the 
entire family — the thing was coming 
down relentlessly, and Charls felt so 
drained of energy that he stopped 
talking. He thought at hen Let’s 
just wait it out here, and she 
squeezed his hand as she thought 
back; Yes, my brother. 

The long box in the circle of light 
continued to descend, inexorable. 

It was odd. Charls could feel a 
human presence, but the mind was 
strangely closed to him. He felt a 
quality of mind that he had never 
felt before. He had read the minds 
of True Men as they flew far over- 
head; he knew the minds of his own 
people; he could distinguish the 
thoughts of most of the birds and 
beasts; it was no trouble to detect 
the crude electronic hunger of the 
mechanical mind of a man- 
shonyagger. 

But this — this being had a mind 
that was raw, elemental, hot. And 
closed. 

Now the box was very near. 
Would it crash in this valley or the 



THE QUEEN OF THE AFTERNOON

next? The screams from within it 
were extremely shrill. Charls’ ears 
hurt and his eyes smarted from the 
intensity of heat and noise. Oda 
held his hand tightly. 

The object crashed into the 
ground. 

It ripped the hillside Just across 
the cenote. Had Oda not instinc- 
tively moved away from the cenote, 
the box would have hit them, Charls 
realized. 

Charls and Oda stood up cau- 
tiously. 

Somehow the box must have de- 
celerated: It was hot, but not hot 
enough to make the broken trees 
around it burst into flame. Steam 
rose from the crushed leaves. 

The noise was gone. 

Charls and Oda moved to within 
ten man-lengths of the object. 
Charls framed his clearest thought 
and flung it at the box; Who are 
you? 

The being within obviously did 
not perceive him as he was. There 
came forth a wild thought, directed 
at living beings in general. 

Fools, fools, help me! Get me out 
of here! 

Oda caught the thought, as did 
Charls. She stepped in mentally and 
Charls was astonished at the clarity 
and force of her inquiry. It was 
simple but beautifully strong and 
hard. She thought the one idea: 

How? 

From the box there came again 
the frantic babble of demand: The 
handles, you fools. The handles on 
the outside. Take the handles and 
let me^out! 

Charls and Oda looked at each 
other. Charls was not sure that he 
really wanted to let this creature 

8 



“out.” Then he thought further. 
Maybe the unpleasantness that 
radiated from the box was simply 
the result of imprisonment. He 
knew that he himself would hate to 
be encased like that. 

Together Charls and Oda risked 
the broken leaves, walking gingerly 
up to the box itself. It was black 
and old; it -looked like something 
the elders called “iron” — and never 
touched. They saw the handles, pit- 
ted and scarred. 

With the ghost of a smile, Charls 
nodded to his sister. Each took a 
handle and lifted. 

The sides of the box crackled. 
The iron was hot but not unbearably 
so. With a rusty shriek, the ancient 
door flew open. 

They looked into the box. 

There lay a young woman. 

She had no fur, only long hair on 
her head. 

Instead of fur, she had strange, 
soft objects on her body but as she 
sat up, these objects began to disin- 
tegrate. 

At first the girl looked frightened; 
then, as she glanced at Oda and 
Charls, she began to laugh. Her 
thought came through, clearly and 
rather cruelly; / guess I don’t have to 
worry about modesty in front of 
puppy dogs. 

Oda did not seem to mind the 
thought but Charls’ feelings were 
hurt. The girl said words with her 
mouth but they could not under- 
stand them. Each of them took an 
elbow and led her to the ground. 

They reached the edge of the ce- 
note and Oda gestured to the 
strange girl to sit down. She did, 
and made more words. 

Oda was as puzzled as Charls, 

GALAXY 




but then she began to smile. Spiek- 
ing had worked before, when the 
girl was in the box. Why not now? 
The only thing was, this odd girl 
did not seem to know how to con- 
trol her thoughts. Everything she 
thought was directed at the world at 
large — at the valley, at the sunset 
sky, at the cenote. She did not seem 
to realize that she was shouting 
every thought aloud. 

Oda put her question to the 
young woman: Who are you? 

The hot, strange mind flung back 
quickly: Juli, of course. 

At this point Charls intervened. 
There’s no “of course” about it he 
spieked. 

What am I doing? the girl’s 
thoughts ran. Tm in mental tele- 
pathy with puppy-dog people. 

Embarrassed. Charls and Oda 
watched her as her thoughts 
splashed out. 

“Doesn’t she know how to close 
off her thoughts?’’ Charls won- 
dered. And why had her mind 
seemed so closed when she was in 
the box? 

Puppy-dog people. Where can / 
be if I’m mixed up with puppy-dog 
people? Can this be Earth? Where 
have I been? How long have I been 
gone? Where is Germany? Where 
are Carlotta and Karla? Where are 
Daddy and Mother and Uncle 
Joachim? Puppy-dog people! 

Charls and Oda felt the sharp 
edge of the mind that was so 
recklessly flinging all these 
thoughts. There was a kind of 
laughter that was cruel each time 
she thought puppy-dog people. They 
could feel that this mind was as 
bright as the brightest minds of the 
True Men — but this mind was dif-

ferent. It did not have the singleness 
of devotion or the wary wisdom that 
saturated the minds of the True 
Men. 

Then Charls remembered some- 
thing. His parents had once told 
him of a mind that was something 
like this one. 

Juli continued to pour out her 
thoughts like sparks from a fire, 
like raindrops from a big splash. 
Charls was frightened and did not 
know what to do; and Oda began to 
turn away from the strange girl. 

Then Charls perceived it. Juli 
was frightened. She was calling 
them puppy-dog people to cover her 
fear. She really did not know where 
she was. 

He mused, not directing his 
thought at Juli, Just because she’s 
frightened, it doesn’t mean she has 
the right to think sharp, bright 
things at us. 

Perhaps it was his posture that 
betrayed his attitude; Juli seemed to 
catch the thought. 

Suddenly she burst into words 
again, words that they could not 
understand. It sounded as though 
she were begging, asking, pleading, 
expostulating. She seemed to be 
calling for specific persons or 
things. Words poured forth, and 
there were names that the True Men 
used. Was it her parents? her lover? 
her siblings? It had to be someone 
she had known before entering that 
screaming box, where she had been 
captive in the blue of the sky 
for . for how long? 

Suddenly she was quiet. Her 
attention had shifted. 

She pointed to the Fighting 
Trees. 

The sunset had so darkened that

the trees were beginning to light up. 
The soft fire was coming to life as 
it had during all the years of Charls’ 
life and those of his forefathers. 

As she pointed, Juli made words 
again. She kept repeating them. It 
sounded like v-a-s-i-s-d-a-s. 

Charls could not help being a lit- 
tle irritated. Why doesn’t she just 
think? It was odd that they could 
not read her mind when she was 
using the words. 

Again, although Charls had not 
aimed the question at her, Juli 
seemed to catch it. From her there 
came a flame of thought, a single 
idea, that leaped like a fountain of 
fire from that tired little female 
head: 

What is this world? 

Then the thought shifted focus 
slightly. Vati, Vati, where am I? 
Where are you? What has become 
of me? There was something forlorn 
and desolate to it. 

Oda put out a soft hand toward 
the girl. Juli looked at her and some 
of the harsh, fearful thoughts re- 
turned. Then the sheer compassion 
of Oda’s posture seemed to catch 
Juli’s attention, and with relaxation 
came complete collapse. The great 
and terrifying thought disappeared. 
Juli burst into tears. She put her 
long arms about Oda. Oda patted 
her back and Juli sobbed even hard- 
er. 

Out of the sobbing came a funny, 
friendly thought, loving and no 
longer contemptuous: Dear little 
puppy dogs, dear little puppy dogs, 
please help me. You are supposed 
to be our best friends ... do help 
me now. 

Charls perked up his ears. Some- 
thing — or someone — was com- 

GALAXY 




ing over the top of the hill. 

Certainly a thought as big and as 
sharp as Juli’s could attract all 
living forms within kilometers. It 
might even catch the attention of 
the aloof but ominous True Men. 

A moment later Charls relaxed. 
He recognized the stride of his 
parents. He turned to Oda. 

“Hear that?” 

She smiled. "It’s father and 
mother. They must have heard that 
big thought the girl had.” 

Charls watched with pride as his 
parents approached. It was a well- 
justified pride. Bil and Kae both 
appeared, as they were, sensitive 
and intelligent. In addition, their fur 
was well-matched. Bil’s beautiful 
caramel coat had spots of white and 
black only along his cheekbones 
and nose and at the tip of his tail; 
Kae was a uniform fawn-beige with 
which her beautiful green eyes 
made a striking contrast. 

“Are you both all right?” Bil 
asked as they approached. “Who is 
that? She looks like a True Man. Is 
she friendly? Has she hurt you? 
Was she the one who was doing all 
that violent thinking? We could feel 
it clear across the hillside.” 

Oda burst into a giggle. “You 
ask as many questions as 1 do. 
Daddy.” 

Charls said, “All we know is that 
a box came from the sky and that 
she was in it. You heard that 
shrieking noise as it came ^own 
first, didn’t you?” 

Kae laughed. “Who didn’t hear 
it?” 

“The box hit right over there. 
You can see where it hurt the 
hillside.” 

The area where the box had 




THE QUEEN OF THE AFTERNOON 



11 





landed was black and forbidding. 
Around it the fallen Fighting Trees 
gleamed in tangled confusion on the 
ground. 

Bil looked at Juli and shook his 
head. “1 don’t see why she wasn’t 
killed if it hit that hard.” 

Juli began to speak in words 
again, but at last she seemed to 
understand. Shouting her language 
would not help any. Instead, she 
thought: Please, dear little puppy 
dogs. Please help me. Please 
understand me. 

Bil kept his dignity but he 
noticed with dismay that his tail 
was wagging of its own accord. He 
realized that the urge was uncon- 
trollable. He felt both resentful and 
happy as he thought back at her; Of 
course we understand you and we'll 
try to help you; but please don’t 
think your thoughts so hard or so 
recklessly. They hurt our minds 
when they are so bright and sharp. 

Juli tried to turn down the inten- 
sity of her thought. She pleaded: 
Take me to Germany. 

The four Unauthorized Men — 
mother, father, daughter and son — 
looked at each other. They had no 
idea of what a Germany might be. 

It was Oda who turned to Juli, 
girl to girl, and spieked: Think some 
Germany at us so we can know 
what it is. 

There came forth from the 
strange girl images of unbelievable 
beauty. Picture after clear picture 
emerged until the little family was 
almost blinded by the magnificence 
of the display. They saw the whole 
ancient world come to life. Cities 
stood bright in a green-encircled 
world. There were no aloof and 
languid True Men; instead, all the 

12 



people they saw in Juli’s mind re- 
sembled Juli herself. They were vi- 
tal, sometimes fierce, forceful; they 
were tall, erect, long-fingered; and 
of course they did not have the tails 
of the Unauthorized Men. The chil- 
dren were pretty beyond belief. 

The most amazing thing about 
this world was the tremendous 
number of people in it. The people 
were thicker than the birds of pas- 
sage, more crowded than the salmon 
at running time. 

Chads had thought himself a 
well-traveled young man. He had 
met at least four dozen other per- 
sons besides his own family, and he 
had seen True Men in the skies 
above him hundreds of times. He 
had often witnessed the intolerable 
brightness of cities and had walked 
around them more than once until, 
each time, he had been firmly as- 
sured that there was no way for him 
to enter. He thought his valley a 
good one. In a few more years he 
would be old enough to visit the 
nearby valleys and to look for a 
wife for himself. 

But this vision that came from 
Juli’s mind ... he could not im- 
agine how so many people could 
live together. How could they all 
greet each other in the mornings? 
How could they all agree on any- 
thing? How could they all ever be- 
come still enough to be aware of 
each other’s presence, each other’s 
needs? 

There came a particularly strong, 
bright image. Small-wheeled boxes 
were hurtling people at insensate 
speed up and down smooth, smooth 
roads. 

“So that’s what roads were for,” 
he gasped to himself. 



GALAXY 




Among the people he saw many n 
dogs. They were nothing like the tl 
creatures of Charls’ world. They tl 
were not the long, otter-like animals t 
whom the Unauthorized Men de- / 
spised as lowly kindred; nor were v 
they like the Unauthorized Men ^ 
themselves, and they were certainly 
not like those modified animals who t< 
in appearance were almost indistin- h 
guishable from True Men. No, c 
these dogs of Juli’s world were f 
bounding, happy creatures with few 
responsibilities. There seemed to be d 
an affectionate relationship between 
them and the people there. They li 
shared laughter and sorrow. S 

Juli had closed her eyes as she tl 
tried to bring Germany to them, s 
Concentrating hard, now she s 
brought into the picture of beauty h 
and happiness something else — v 
fearful flying things that dropped h 
fire; thunder and noise; a most un- b 
pleasant face, a screaming face with tl 
a dab of black fur above the /mouth; b 
a licking of flame in the night; a a 
thunder of death machines. Across tl 
this thunder there was the image of C 
Juli and two other girls who resem- 
bled her; they were moving with a e 
man, obviously their father, toward b 
three iron boxes that looked like the f 
one Juli had landed in. Then there a 
was darkness. a 

That was Germany. a 

Juli slumped to the ground. 

Gently the four of them probed at 
her mind. To them it was like a b 
diamond, as clear and transparent as li 
a sunlit pool in the forest, but the b 
light it shot back to them was not a h 
reflection. It was rich and bright h 
and dazzling. Now that it was at 
rest, they could see deeply into it. tl 

They saw hunger, hurt and loneli- li 

THE QUEEN OF THE AFTERNOON 



ness. They saw a loneliness so great 
that each of them in turn tried to 
think of a way to assuage it. Love, 
they thought, what she needs is 
love, and her own kind. But where 
would they find an Ancient One? 
Would a True Man answer? 

Bil said, “There’s only one thing 
to do. We’ve got to take her to the 
house of the Wise Old Bear. He has 
communications with the True 
Men.’’ 

Oda cried out, “But she hasn’t 
done anything wrong!’’ 

Her father looked at her. “Dar- 
ling, we don’t know what this is. 
She’s an Ancient One come back to 
this world after a sleep in space it- 
self. It’s been thousands of years 
since her world lived; I think she’s 
beginning to realize that, and that’s 
what put her into shock. We need 
help. Our people may once have 
been dogs, and that’s what she 
thinks we are. We can’t let that 
bother us. But she needs a house, 
and the only unauthorized house 
that I know of belongs to the Wise 
Old Bear.’’ 

Charls looked at his parents. His 
eyes were troubled. “What is this 
business about dogs? Is that why we 
feel so mixed up when we think 
about True Men? I’m confused 
about her too. Do you- suppose I re- 
ally want to belong to her?’’ 

“Not really,” his father said. 
“That’s just a feeling left over from 
long, long ago. We lead our own 
lives now. But this girl, she’s too 
big a problem for us. We will take 
her to the Bear. At least he has a 
house.” 

Juli was still unconscious, and to 
them she was so big. Each took a 
limb and with difficulty they man- 



13 




aged to carry her. Within less than 
a tenth of a night they had reached 
the house of the wise Old Bear. 
Fortunately they had not met any 
manshonyaggers or other dangers of 
the forest. 

At the door of the house of the 
Wise Old Bear they gently laid the 
girl on the ground. 

Bil shouted, “Bear, Bear, come 
out, come out!” 

“Who is there?” a voice boomed 
from within. 

“Bil and his family. We have an 
Ancient with us. Come out. We 
need your help.” 

The light that had been streaming 
from the doorway with a yellow 
glare was suddenly reduced to en- 
durable proportions as the immense 
bulk of the Bear loomed in the 
doorway before them. 

He pulled his spectacles from a 
case attached to his belt, put them 
on his nose and squinted at Juli. 

“Bless my soul,” he said. 
“Another one. Where on earth did 
you get an ancient girl?” 

Pompous but happy, Charls spoke 
up, “She came out of the sky in a 
screaming box.” 

The Bear nodded wisely. 

Then Bil spoke up. “You said 
‘another one.’ What did you 
mean?” 

The Bear winced slightly. 
“Forget I said that,” he told them. 
“I forgot for a moment that you are 
not True Men. Please forget it.” 

Bil said, “You mean it’s some- 
thing Unauthorized Men are not 
supposed to know about?” 

The Bear nodded unhappily. 

Understanding, Bil said, “Well, 
if you can ever tell us about it, will 
you, please?” 



“Of course,” the Bear replied. 
“And now I think I’d better call my 
housekeeper to take care of her. 
Herkie, Herkie, come here.” 

A blonde woman appeared, peer- 
ing anxiously. 

Obviously there was something 
the matter with her blue eyes but 
she seemed to be functioning 
adequately. 

Bil backed away from the door. 
“That’s an Experimental person,” 
he said. “That’s a cat!” 

The Bear was completely unin- 
terested. “So it is, but you can see 
that her eyes are imperfect. That’s 
why she ir allowed to be my house- 
keeper and why her name isn’t pref- 
aced by a C’. ” 

Bil understood. The errors True 
Men made in trying to breed Un- 
derpersons were often destroyed but 
occasionally one was allowed to 
live if it seemed able tQ-fun,c^on at 
some necessary task. The Bear^fiad 
connections with True Men. If he 
needed a housekeeper, an imperfect 
modified .animal provided an ideal 
solution. 

Herkie bent over Juli’s still form. 
She peered in puzzlement at Juli’s 
face. Then she looked up at the 
Bear. “I don’t understand,” she 
said. “I don’t see how it could 
be.” 

“Later,” the Bear said. “When 
we are alone.” 

Herkie strained to see into the 
darkness and perceived the dog fam- 
ily. “Oh, I see,” she said. 

Bil and Charls were embarrassed. 
Oda and Kae did not seem to notice 
the slight. 

Bil waved his hand. “Well, 
good-by. 1 hope you can take care 
of her all right.”

GALAXY 




“Thank you for bringing her,” 
the Bear said. “The True Men will 
probably give you a reward.” 

^ In spite of himself, Bil felt his 
tail beginning to wag again. 

“Will we ever see her again?” 
Oda asked. ‘‘Do you think weTl 
ever see her again? I love her, I 
love her. .V 

“Perhaps,” her father answered. 
“She will know who saved her, and 
I think she will seek us out.” 

★ ★ ★ 

Juli awoke slowly. Where am I? 
What is this place? She had a par- 
tial return of memory. The puppy- 
dog people. Where are they? She felt 
conscious of someone at her bed- 
side. She looked up into clouded 
blue eyes staring anxiously into 
hers. 

‘‘I’m Herkie,” the woman said. 
‘‘I’m the Bear’s housekeeper.” 

Juli felt as though she had 
awakened in a mental hospital. It 
was all so impossible. Puppy-dog 
people and now a bear? And surely 
the blonde woman with the bad 
eyes was not a human? 

Herkie patted her hand. ‘‘Of 
course you’re confused,” she said. 

Juli was taken aback. ‘‘You’re 
talking! You’re talking and I under- 
stand you. You’re talking German. 
We’re not just communicating tele- 
pathically.” 

‘‘Of course,” Herkie said. ‘‘I 
speak true Doych. It’s one of the 
Bear’s favorite languages.” 

‘‘One of. .” Juli broke off. 
‘‘It’s all so confusing.” 

Again Herkie patted her hand. 
‘‘Of course it is.” 

Juli lay back and looked at the 



ceiling. I must be in some other 
world. 

No, Herkie thought at her, but 
you’ve been gone a long time. 

The Bear came into the room. 
“Feeling better?” he asked. 

Juli merely nodded. 

‘‘In the morning we will decide 
what to do,” he said. ‘‘1 have some 
connections with the True Men, and 
I think that we had best take you to 
the Vomacht.” 

Juli sat up as if hit by a bolt of 
lightning. ‘‘What do you mean, ‘the 
Vomacht’? That is my name, Vom 
Acht!” 

‘‘I thought it might be,” the Bear 
said. Herkie, peering at her from 
the bedside, nodded wisely. 

“I was sure of it,” she said. 
Then, ‘‘I think you need some good 
hot soup and a rest. In the morning 
it will all straighten itself out.” 

The tiredness of years seemed to 
settle in Juli’s bones. I do need to 
rest she thought. I need to get 
things sorted out in my mind. So 
suddenly that she did not even have 
a chance to be startled by it, she 
was asleep. 

Heiide and the Bear studied her 
face. ‘‘There’s a remarkable resem- 
blance,” the Bear said. Herkie nod- 
ded in agreement. ‘‘It’s the time 
differential I’m worried about. Do 
you think that will be important?” 

“I don’t know,” Herkie replied. 
“Since I’m not human, I don’t 
know what bothers people.” She 
straightened and stretched to her full 
length. ‘‘I know!” she said. do 
know! She must have been sent 
here to help us with the rebellion!” 

“No,” the Bear said. ‘‘She has 
been too long in Time for her arriv- 
al to have been intentional. It is 



THE QUEEN OF THE AFTERNOON 



15 




true that she may help us, she may 
very well help us, but I think that 
her arrival at this particular time 
and place is fortuitous rather than 
planned.” 

“Sometimes I think I understand 
a particular human mind,” Herkie 
said, “but I’m sure you’re correct. I 
can hardly wait for them to meet 
each other!” 

“Yes,” he said, “although I’m 
afraid that it’s going to be rather 
traumatic. In more than one way.” 

* * * 

When Juli awoke after her deep 
sleep, she found a thoughtful Herkie 
awaiting her. 

Juli stretched and her mind, still 
uncontrolled, asked: Are you really 
a cal? 

Yes, Herkie thought back at her. 
But you are going to have to disci- 
pline that thought process of yours. 
Everyone can read your thoughts. 

I’m sorry, Juli spieked, but I’m 
just not used to all this telepathy. 

“I know.” Herkie had switched 
to German. 

“I still don’t understand how you 
know German,” Juli said. 

“It’s rather a long story. I 
learned it from the Bear. I think, 
perhaps, you had better ask him 
how he learned it.” 

“Wait a minute. I’m beginning to 
remember what happened before I 
fell asleep. The Bear mentioned my 
name, my family name, Vom 
Acht.” 

Herkie switched the subject. 
“We’ve made you some clothes. 
We tried to copy the style of those 
you had on, but they were coming 
to pieces so badly that we are not 

16 



sure we got the new ones right.” 

She looked so anxious to please 
that Juli reassured her immediately. 
If they fit. I’m sure they’ll be Just 
fine. 

Oh, they fit, Herkie spieked. We 
measured you. Now, qfter your bath 
and meal, you will dress and the 
Bear and I will take you to the city. 
Underpersons like me are not ordi- 
narily allowed in the city, but this 
time I think that an exception will 
be made. 

There was something sweet and 
wise in the face with the clouded 
blue eyes. Juli felt that Herkie was 
her friend. / am, Herkie spieked, 
and Juli was once more made aware 
that she must learn to control her 
thoughts, or at least the broadcast- 
ing of them. 

You’ll learn, Herkie spieked. It 
just takes some practice. 

They approached the city on foot, 
the Bear leading the way, Juli be- 
hind him and Herkie bringing up 
the rear. They encountered two 
manshonyaggers along the road but 
the Bear spoke true Doych to them 
from some distance and they turned 
silently and slunk away. 

Juli was fascinated. “What are 
they?” she asked. 

“Their real name is ‘Menschen- 
j'ager’ and they were invented to kill 
people whose ideas did not accord 
with those of the Sixth German 
Reich. But there are very few of them 
still functional, and so many of us 
have learned Doych since . 
since. .” 

“Yes?” 

“Since an event you’ll find out 
about in the city. Now let’s get on 
with it.” 

They neared the city wall and Juli 

GALAXY 




became conscious of a buzzing 
sound, and of a powerful force that 
excluded them. Her hair stood on 
end and she felt a tingling sensation 
of mild electrical shock. Obviously 
there was a force field around the 
city. 

“What is it?” she cried out. 

“Just a static charge to keep back 
the Wild,” the Bear said sooth- 
ingly. “Don’t worry, I have a 
damper for it.” 

He held up a small device in his 
right paw, pushed a button on it, 
and immediately a corridor opened 
before them. 

When they reached the city wall, 
the Bear felt carefully along the 
upper ridge. At a certain point he 
paused, then reached for a strange- 
looking key that hung from a cord 
around his neck. 

Juli could see no difference be- 
tween this section of the wall and 
any other but the Bear inserted his 
key into a notch he had located and 
a section of the barrier swung up. 
The three passed through and si- 
lently the wall fell back into posi- 
tion. 

The Bear hurried them along 
dusty streets. Juli saw a number of 
people but most of them seemed to 
her aloof, austere, uncaring. They 
bore little resemblance to the lusty 
Prussians she remembered. 

Eventually they arrived at the 
door of a large building that looked 
old and imposing. Beside the door 
there was an inscription. The Bear 
was hurrying them through the en- 
tryway. 

Oh. please, Mr. Bear, may I stop 
to read it? 

Just plain Bear is all right. And 
yes, of course you may. It may even 



help you to understand some of the 
things that you are going to learn 
today. 

The inscription was in German, 
and it was in the form of a poem. It 
looked as though it had been carved 
hundreds of years earlier (as indeed 
it had. Juli could not know that at 
this time). 

Herkie looked up. "Oh, the 
first. ...” 

“Hush.” said the Bear. 

Juli read the poem to herself si- 
lently. 

Youth 

Fading, fading, going 
Flowing 

Like life blood from your 
veins. 

Little remains. 

The glorious face 
Erased, 

Replaced 

By one which mirrors tears. 

The years 
Gone by. 

Oh, Youth, 

Linger yet a while ! 

Smile 

Still upon us 
The wretched few 
Who worship 
You. 

“I don’t understand it,” said 
Juli. 

“You will,” the Bear said. “Un- 
fortunately, you will” 

★ ★ ★ 

An official in a bright green robe 
trimmed with gold approached. 

“We have not had the honor of 
your presence for some time,” he 



the queen of the afternoon 



17 




said respectfully to the Bear. 

“I’ve been rather busy,’’ the 
Bear replied. “But how is she?’’ 

Juli realized with a start that the 
conversation was not telepathic but 
was in German. How do all these 
people know German? She unthink- 
ingly flung her thought abroad. 

Hush came back the simultaneous 
warnings from Herkie and the Bear. 

Juli felt thoroughly admonished. 
“I’m sorry,’’ she almost whispered. 
“I don’t know how I’ll ever learn 
the trick.” 

Herkie was immediately sym- 
pathetic. “It is a trick,” she said, 
“but you’re already better at it than 
you were when you arrived. You 
just have to be careful. You can’t 
fling your thoughts everywhere.” 

“Never mind that now,” the 
Bear said and he turned to the 
green-uniformed official. “Is it pos- 
sible to have an audience? I think 
it’s important.” 

“You may have to wait a little 
while,” the official said, “but I’m 
sure she will always grant audience 
to you.” 

The Bear looked a little smug at 
that, Juli noticed. 

They sat down to wait and from 
time to time Herkie patted Juli’s 
arm reassuringly. 

it * * 

It was actually not long before 
the official reappeared. “She will 
see you now,” he said. 

He led them through a long cor- 
ridor to a large room at the end of 
which was a dais with a chair. 
“Not quite a throne,” Juli thought 
to herself. Behind the chair stood a 
young and handsome male, a True 

18 



Man. In the chair sat a woman, old, 
old beyond imagining; her wrinkled 
hands were claws, but in the hag- 
gard, wrinkled face one could still 
detect some trace of beauty. 

Juli’s sense of bewilderment 
grew. She knew this person, but she 
did not. Her sense of orientation, 
already splintered by the events of 
the past “day,” almost disinte- 
grated. She grabbed Herkie ’s hand 
as if it were the only familiar ele- 
ment in a world she could not un- 
derstand. 

The woman spoke. Her voice was 
old and weak, but she spoke in 
German. 

“So, Juli, you have come. Laird 
told me he was bringing you in. I 
am so happy to see you, and to 
know that you are all right.” 

Juli’s senses reeled. She knew, 
she knew, but she could not believe. 
Too much had changed, too much 
had happened, in the short time that 
she had returned to life. 

Gasping, tentatively she whis- 
pered, “Carlotta?” 

Her sister nodded. “Yes, Juli, it 
is I. And this is my husband, 
Laird.” She nodded her head to- 
ward the handsome young man be- 
hind her. “He brought me in about 
two hundred years ago, but unfortu- 
nately as an Ancient I cannot 
undergo the rejuvenation process 
that has been developed since we 
left the earth.” 

Juli began to sob. “Oh, Carlotta, 
it’s all so hard to believe. And 
you’re so old! You were only two 
years older than I.” 

“Darling, I’ve had two hundred 
years of bliss. They couldn’t re- 
juvenate me but they could at least 
prolong my life. Now, it is not 

GALAXY 





from purely altruistic purposes that I 
have had Laird bring you in. Karla 
is still out there, but since she was 
only sixteen when she was sus- 
pended, we thought that you would 
be better suited to the task. 

“In fact, we really didn’t do you 
any favor in bringing you in be- 
cause now you too will begin to 
age. But to be forever in suspended 
animation is not any life either.” 
“Of course not,” Juli said. “And 
anyway, if I had lived a normal 
life, I would have aged.” 

Carlotta leaned over to kiss her. 
“At least we’re together at last,” 
Juli sighed. 

“Darling,” Carlotta said, “it is 
wonderful to have even this little 
time together. You see. I’m dying. 
There comes a point when, with all 
technology, the scientists cannot 
keep a body alive. And we need 



help, help with the rebellion.” 

“The rebellion?” 

“Yes. Against the Jwindz. They 
were Chinesians, (rfiilosophers. Now 
they are the true rulers of the Earth, 
and we — so they believe — are 
merely their instrumentality, their 
police force. Their power is not 
over the body of man but over the 
soul. That is almost a forgotten 
word here now. Say ‘mind’ instead. 
They call themselves the Perfect 
Ones and have sought to remake 
man in their own image. But they 
are remote, removed, bloodless. 

“They have recruited persons of 
all races, but man has not re- 
sponded well. Only a handful aspire 
to the kind of esthetic perfection the 
Jwindz have as their goal. So the 
Jwindz have resorted to their 
knowledge of drugs and opiates to 
turn True Man into a tranquilized.

indifferent people — to make it easy 
to govern them, to control every- 
thing that they do. Unfortunately 
some of our,” she nodded toward 
Laird, “descendants have joined 
them. 

“We need you, Juli. Since I 
came back from the ancient world, 
Laird and I have done what we 
could to free True Men from this 
form of slavery, because it is slav- 
ery. It is a lack of vitality, a lack of 
meaning to life. We used to have a 
word for it in the old days. Re- 
member? ‘Zombie.’ ” 

“What do you want me to do?” 

During the entire conversation be- 
tween the sisters, Herkie, the Bear 
and Laird had remained silent. 

Now Laird spoke. “Until Carlotta 
came to us, we were drifting along, 
uncaring, in the power of the 
Jwindz. We did not know what it 
was, really, to be a human being. 
We felt that our only purpose in life 
was to serve the Jwindz: If they 
were perfect, what other function 
could we perform? It was our duty 
to serve their needs — to maintain 
and guard the cities, to keep out the 
Wild, to administer the drugs. Some 
of the Instrumentality even preyed 
upon the Unauthorized Men, the 
Unforgiven and, as a last resort, the 
True Men, to supply their 
laboratories. 

“But now many of us no longer 
believe in the perfection of the 
Jwindz — or perhaps we have come 
to believe in something more than 
human perfection. We have been 
serving men. We should have been 
serving mankind. 

“Now we feel that the time has 
come to put an end to this tyranny. 
Carlotta and I have allies among 

20 



some of our descendants and among 
some of the Unforgiven and, as you 
have seen, even among the Unau- 
thorized Men and other animal- 
derived persons. I think there must 
still be a connection from the time 
that human beings had ‘pets’ in the 
old days.” 

Juli looked about her and realized 
that Herkie was quietly purring. 
“Yes,” she said, “I see what you 
mean.” 

Laird continued, “What we want 
to do is to set up a real 
Instrumentality — not a force for the 
service of the Jwindz, but one for 
the service of man. We are deter- 
mined that never again shall man 
betray his own image. We will es- 
tablish the Instrumentality of Man- 
kind, one benevolent but not ma- 
nipulative.” 

Carlotta nodded slowly. Her aged 
face showed concern. “I will die in 
a few days and you will marry 
Laird. You will be the new Vom- 
acht. With any luck by the time you 
are as old as I am, your descendants 
and some of mine should have freed 
the earth from the power of the 
Jwindz.” 

Juli again felt completely dis- 
oriented. “I’m to marry your hus- 
band?” 

Again Laird spoke. “I have loved 
your sister well for more than two 
hundred years. I shall love you too, 
because you are so much like her. 
Do not think that I am being dis- 
loyal. She and I have discussed this 
for some time before I brought you 
in. If she were not dying, I should 
continue to be faithful to her. But 
now we need you.” 

Carlotta concurred. “It is true. 
He has made me very happy, and 

GALAXY 




he will make you happy too, 
through all the years of your life. 
Juli, I could not have had you 
brought in had I not had some plan 
for your future. You could never be 
happy with one of those drugged, 
tranquilized True Men. Trust me in 
this, please. It is the only thing to 
do.” 

Tears formed in Juli’s eyes. “To 
have found you at last and then to 
lose you after such a short 
time. .” 

Hericie patted her hand and Juli 
looked up to see sympathetic tears 
in her clouded blue eyes. 

* * * 

It was three days later that Car- 
lotta died. She died with a smile on 
her face and Laird and Juli each 
holding one of her hands. She 
spoke at the last and pressed their 
hands. “I’ll see you later. Out 
among the stars.” 

Juli wept uncontrollably. 

They postponed the wedding 
ceremony for seven days of mourn- 
ing. For once the city gates were 
opened and the static fields of elec- 
tricity cut off because even the 
Jwindz could not control the feel- 
ings of the animal-derived persons, 
the Unauthorized Men, even some 
of the True Men, toward this 
woman who had come to them from 
an ancient world. 

The Bear was particularly mourn- 
ful. “I was the one who found her, 
you know, after you brought her 
in,” he said to Laird. 

“I remember.” 

So that’s what the Bear meant 
^hen he said ‘another one,’ Bil 
said. 



Charls and Oda, Bil and Kae 
were among the mourners. Juli saw 
them and thought, my dear little 
puppy-dog people, but this time the 
thought was loving and not con- 
temptuous. 

Oda’s tail wagged. I’ve thought 
of something, she spieked at Juli. 
Can you meet me down by the ce- 
note in two days’ time? 

Yes, thought Juli, proud of her- 
self at being sure, for the first time, 
that her thought had gone only to 
the person for whom it was meant. 
She knew that she had been suc- 
cessful when she glanced at Laird’s 
face and saw that he had not read 
her thought. 

When she met Oda at the cenote, 
Juli did not know what was ex- 
pected of her — nor what she herself 
expected. 

You must be very careful in di- 
recting your thoughts, Oda spieked. 
We never know when some of the 
Jwindz are overhead. 

I think I’m learning, Juli spieked. 
Oda nodded. 

What my idea was, it was to 
make use of the Fighting Trees. The 
True Men are still afraid of the 
sickness. But, you see, I know that 
the sickness is gone. I got so tired 
of brushing past the trees and al- 
ways worrying about it that I de- 
cided to test it out, and I ate a pod 
from one of the Fighting Trees — and 
nothing happened. I’ve never been 
afraid of them since. So if we met 
there, we rebels, in a grove of the 
Fighting Trees, the officials of the 
Jwindz would never find us. They’d 
be afraid to hunt for us there. 

Juli’s face lightened. That’s a 
very good idea. May I consult with 
Laird? 



the queen of the afternoon 



21 




Certainly. He has always been 
one of us. And your sister was too. 

Juli was sad again. I feel so 
alone. 

No. You have Laird, and you 
have us. and the Bear, and his 
housekeeper. And in time there will 
be others. Now we must part. 

Juli returned from her meeting 
with Oda at the cenote to find Laird 
deep in conference with the Bear 
and a young man who bore a singu- 
lar resemblance to Laird— and to 
the youthful Carlotta that Juli re- 
tnembered. 

Laird smiled at her. “This is 
your great-nephew,” he said, “my 
grandson.” 

Juli’s perspective of time and age 
received another jolt. Laird ap- 
peared to be no older than his 
grandson. How do I fit in to this? 
she wondered, and accidentally 
broadcast the thought. 

“I know that all of this must be 
difficult for you to comprehend,” 
Laird said, t^ing her hand. “Car- 
lotta had some difficulty in adjust- 
ing too. But try, please try, my 
dear, because we need you so des- 
perately and I, I particularly, have al- 
ready become dependent on you. I 
could not face Carlotta’s loss with- 
out you.” 

Juli felt a vague sense of embar- 
rassment. “What is my — ” she 
could not say it — “what is his 
name?” 

“I beg your pardon. He is named 
Joachim for your uncle.” 

Joachim smiled and then gave her 
a brief hug. “You see,” he said, 
“the reason we need your help with 
the rebellion is the cult that was 
built up around your sister, my 
grandmother. When she returned to 

22 



earth as an Ancient One, there was 
a kind of cult set up about her. That 
is why she was The Vomacht’ and 
why you must also be. It is a rally- 
ing point for those of us who op- 
pose the power of the Jwindz. 
Grandmother Carlotta had a mini- 
kingdom here, and even the Jwindz 
could not keep people from coming 
to pay her court. You must have re- 
alized that at the mourning session 
for her. ’ ’ 

“Yes, I could see that she had a 
great deal of respect from many 
kinds of people. If she was in favor 
of a rebellion, I am sure she must 
have been correct. Carlotta was al- 
ways a most upright person. And 
now I must tell you about the plan 
that Oda proposes.” She proceeded 
to do so. 

“It might work,” the Bear said. 
“True Men have been very careful 
about observing the tambu of the 
Fighting Trees. In fact, I may even 
have an improvement on Oda’s 
idea.” He began to get excited and 
dropped his spectacles. Joachim 
picked them up. 

“Bear,” he said, “you always do 
that when you’re excited.” 

“I think it means I have a good 
idea,” the Bear said. “Look, why 
don’t we use the manshonyaggers?” 

The others looked at him in be- 
wilderment and Laird said slowly, 
“I think I may see what you’re get- 
ting at. The manshonyaggers, al- 
though there are not many of them 
left, respond only to German 
and—” 

“And the leaders of the Jwindz 
are Chinesian, too proud to have 
learned another language,” the Bear 
broke in, smiling. 

“Yes. So if we establish head- 

GALAXY 




quarters in the Fighting Trees and 
let it be known that the new Vom- 
acht is there — ” 

“And surround the grove with 
manshonyaggers — ’ ’ 

They were breaking in upon each 
other as the idea began to take 
shape. The excitement grew. 

“I think it will work,” Laird 
said. 

“I think so too,” Joachim reas- 
sured him. “I will get together the 
Band of Cousins and after you’re 
established in the Fighting Trees, 
we’ll make a raid on the drug center 
and bring the tranquilizers to the 
grove, where we can destroy 
them.” 

“The Band of Cousins?” Juli 
asked. 

“Carlotta’s and my descendants 
who have not joined the Instrumen- 
tality of the Jwindz,” Laird told 
her. 

“Why would any of them have 
joined?” 

“Laird shrugged. “Greed, power, 
all kinds of very human motives. 
Even an illusion of physical immortal- 
ity. We tried to give our chil- 
dren ideals but the corruption of pow- 
er is very great. You must know 
that.” 

Remembering a howling, hateful 
face with a black mustache above 
the mouth, a face from her own 
time and place, Juli nodded. 

* * * 

Herkie and the Bear, Chari s and 
Oda, Bil and Kae accompanied Juli 
into the grove of Fighting Trees. At 
first Bil and Kae were reluctant. It 
was only after Oda’s confession of 
having eaten a pod that they agreed 
to go, and then Bil’s reaction was 



that of a typical father. 

“How could you take such a 
chance?” he asked Oda. 

Her eyes were bright and her tail 
wagged furiously. “I just had to,” 
she said. 

He glanced at Herkie. “Now if 
she had done it. 

Herkie drew herself up to her full 
height. “I think that the relationship 
of curiosity and cats has, perhaps, 
been a little exaggerated,” she said. 
“Actually, we’re generally rather 
careful.” 

“I didn’t mean to be disrespect- 
ful,” Bil said hastily, and Herkie 
saw his tail droop. 

“It’s a common misconception,” 
she said kindly and Bil’s tail 
straightened. 

When they reached the center of 
the grove, they spread a picnic and 
gathered around. Juli was hungry. 
In the city she had been offered 
synthetic food, no doubt healthful 
and full of vitamins but not satisfy- 
ing to the appetite of an Ancient 
Russian girl. The animal-derived 
persons had brought real food and 
Juli ate happily. 

The Bear, in particular, noticed 
her enjoyment. “You see,” he said, 
“that’s how they did it.” 

“Did what?” asked Juli, her 
mouth full of bread. 

“How they drugged the majority 
of True Men. True Mdn were so 
accustomed to living on synthetic 
foodstuffs that when the Jwindz in- 
troduced tranquilizers into the 
synthetics. True Men never knew 
the difference. I hope that if the 
Band of Cousins succeeds in captur- 
ing the drug supply, the withdrawal 
symptoms for the True Men will not 
be too severe.” 



the queen of the afternoon 



23 




Bil looked up. “That’s something 
we should consider,” he said. “If 
there are severe withdrawal 
symptoms, a number of the True 
Men may be tempted to join the 
Jwindz in an attempt to recover the 
drugs.” 

"file Bear nodded. “That’s what I 
was thinking,” he said. 

* * * 

It was several days before Laird, 
Joachim and the Band of Cousins 
joined them. By this time Juli had 
become almost accustomed to the 
daylight darkness under the thick 
leaves and branches of the Fighting 
Trees, and the soft-glowing illumi- 
nation at night. 

Laird greeted her affectionately. 
“I have missed you,” he said sim- 
ply. “Already I have grown very at- 
tached to you.” 

Juli blushed and changed the sub- 
ject. “Did you — or, rather, the 
Band of Cousins — succeed?” 

“Oh, yes. There was very little 
difficulty. The officials of the 
Jwindz had grown quite careless 
since they have had the minds of 
most True Men under their control 
for generations. It was only a matter 
of Joachim’s pretending to be tran- 
quilized, and he had free access to 
the drug room. Over a period of 
days he managed to transfer the en- 
tire supply to the Cousins and to 
substitute placebos. I wonder when 
that will be discovered.” 

“As soon as the first withdrawal 
symptoms occur, I should think,” 
Joachim ventured. 

Something that had been nagging 
at the back of Juli’s mind surfaced. 
“You have yourgrawJson here, and 
the Band of Cousins. But where are 

24 



your and Carlotta’s own children? 
Obviously you had some.” 

His face saddened. “Of course. 
But since they were half-Ancient, 
they could not only not be rejuve- 
nated, but the combination of the 
chemistry made it such that their 
lives could not even be prolonged. 
They all died in their seventies and 
eighties. It was a great sadness to 
Carlotta and me. You too, my dear, 
if we have children, must be pre- 
pared for that. By the time of the 
next generation, however, the An- 
cient blood is sufficiently diluted 
that rejuvenation may take place. 
Joachim is a hundred and fifty years 
old.” 

“And you? and you?” she said. 

He looked at her. “This is very 
hard on you, isn’t it? I’m over three 
hundred years old.” 

Juli could not disbelieve but 
neither could she quite comprehend. 
Laird was so handsome and youth- 
ful; Carlotta had been so old. 

She tried to shake the cobwebs 
from her mind. “What do we do 
with the tranquilizers now that we 
have them?” 

Oda had approached at the latter 
part of the conversation. Her eyes 
sparkled and her tail wagged madly. 
“I have an idea,” she announced. 

“I hope it’s as good as your last 
one,” Laird said. 

“I hope so too. Look, why don’t 
we just feed the tranquilizers back 
to the officials? The Jwindz prob- 
ably will never notice. Then we 
won’t have to worry about fighting 
them. They could just gradually die 
off; or maybe ... do you 
think ... we could send them out 
into space? To another planet?” 

Laird nodded slowly. “You do 

GALAXY 




have good ideas. Yes, to feed the 
tranquilizers back to them ... but 
how?” 

“We work well together,” the 
Bear said, indicating Oda. “She has 
an idea and it triggers another one 
in my mind.” Carefully he put on 
his spectacles. “I have here a map 
of the terrain in this vicinity. Except 
for the cenote there is no water for 
many kilometers in any direction. If 
we dropped the tranquilizers — all of 
them — into the cenote, and then if 
one of the Cousins could prepare 
the synthetic food of the Jwindz’s 
officials so it was very spicy — 1 
think that the problem would be 
solved.” 

Laird said, “We do have one of 
the Cousins who has infiltrated the 
Jwindz. But what would induce 
them to drink the water?” 

Charls had joined the group. “I 
have heard,” he said, “of an an- 
cient spice people used to like 
which eventually produced thirst. 
It used to be found in the oceans, 
before they were filled with grass. 
But some of it remains on the banks 
of the sea. I believe that it was 
called ‘salt.’ ” 

“Now that you mention it. I’ve 
heard of that too,” the Bear nodded 
wisely. “So that is what we need to 
do. ‘Salt.’ We introduce it into their 
food, then we entice them to the 
grove with the knowledge that the 
new Vomacht is here together with 
the heart of a rebellion. It’s risky 
but I think it’s the best idea, or 
combination of ideas, yet.” 

Laird agreed. “It’s as you say, 
risky, but it may work, and they’re 
not likely to execute any of us if it 
doesn’t. They’ll Just tranquilize us. 

I think that we have a better than 



even chance of winning. And if 
True Man is not revitalized, not 
freed from this bondage of tranquil- 
ity and apathy, I believe that the en- 
tire breed will be extinguished 
within a few hundred years. They 
have come to the point that they 
care about nothing.” 

* * * 

All worlds know how the plan 
was carried out. It was exactly as 
the Bear had foretold. The -thirsty 
officials of the Jwindz, their food 
highly salted, drank eagerly from 
the water of the cenote and were 
quickly tranquilized. They put up 
no opposition to the members of the 
rebellion who soon thereafter 
emerged from the shelter of the 
Fighting Trees. 

Joachim was sad. “One of my 
brothers had Joined them,” he said. 

Laird laid a comforting arm 
across his shoulder. “Well, he’s 
only tranquilized. We may be able 
to help him as he comes out of it.” 

“Perhaps, but it violates all my 
principles.” 

“Don’t be too high-minded, 
Joachim. Principles are fine, but 
there is such a thing as rehabilita- 
tion.” 

And this was the way that the In- 
strumentality of Mankind was estab- 
lished. In time it would govern 
many worlds. Juli, by virtue of 
being the Vomacht, became one of 
the first Ladies of the Instrumental- 
ity. Laird, as her husband, was one 
of the first Lords. 

Juli lived to see some of her de- 
scendants among the first great 
Scanners in Space. She was very 
proud of them, and she was very 

25 



THE QUEEN OF THE AFTERNOON 





old. Laird, of course, was as young 
as ever. All of her animal- 
descended friends had long since 
died. She missed them, although 
Laird was ever faithful. 

At last, so old that she had diffi- 
culty in moving, Juli called Laird to 
her. She looked up into his hand- 
some face. “My darling, you have 
made me very happy, just as you 
did Carlotta. But now 1 am old and, 
I think, dying. You are still so 
young and vital. I wish it were pos- 
sible for me to undergo the rejuve- 
nation, but since it isn’t possible, I 
think we should call in Karla.’’ 

He responded so rapidly that her 
feelings were somewhat hurt. “Yes, 
I think that we should call in 
Karla.’’ 

He turned away from her momen- 
tarily. 

She said, with a hint of tears in 
her voice, “I know that you will 
make her happy and love her very 
much.’’ 

His silence continued for a mo- 
ment before" he turned back to her. 

She saw suddenly that there were 
lines in his face, lines she had never 
seen before. 

“What is happening to you?’’ she 
asked. 

“My darling and last love,’’ he 
said, “I will be losing you twice. I 
cannot bear it. I have asked the 
physician for medicine to counteract 
the rejuvenation. In an hour I shall 
be as old as you. We are going to- 
gether. And somewhere out there 
we will meet Carlotta and we will 
hold hands, the three of us, among 
the stars. Karla will find her own 
man and her own fate.’’ 

Together they sat and watched 
the descent of Karla’s spacecraft. ★

In Soviet science fiction, the Golden Age 
was the 1960’s— and Olga Larionova one of 
its stars. Translator Pat McGuire has worked 
with the Macmillan Russian sf program. An 
unusual tale of an artist’s responsibility. 



It was already past five. Astor 
walked through the emptying cor- 
ridors of the Insititute — and the fur- 
ther behind he left the glass doors 
of the laboratories and workshops, 
the further he abandoned everyday 
thoughts, all that made him merely 
a physicist. 

Now he had only to proceed 
another twenty paces, descend the 
old-fashioned staircase in the entry- 
way and go down from the Institute 
and be twenty minutes by air from 
the Writer’s Union. 

By the time he got home, he 
would have ceased to be a physicist 
because evening was coming on. 
Evenings he was not just Astor 
Elamit but the World-Famous Writ- 
er. He walked without hurrying al- 
though today of all days he really 
should hurry. Instead, he looked 
into every doorway and sometimes 
entered a room and looked around 
the cabinets and instruments. He 
was relaxing. This was a small 
break, a respite, a breathing space 
between the two states in which he 
alternated every day. It was Just that 
way — “states”, and not “profes- 
sions.” These were the minutes 
when he allowed himself to be 
neither one thing nor the other but 
simply a tired human being, free of 

28 



everything. As always, he spent 
those minutes seeking out Rika; he 
knew she had not yet left the build- 
ing. 

He found her sitting on the 
windowsill in the small computer 
room. She sat with her chin resting 
on her knees, sad and disheveled, 
and it was clear that Astor would 
never manage to handle all 
her small, girlish troubles. 

He went over to her. He wanted 
to say something but he could not 
even imagine why he had searched 
her out. It must be that the pleasure 
of seeing her was itself enough for 
him. 

But now as he looked at her, he 
could not discern within himself so 
much as a hint of pleasure. As 
usual, it was simply not there. What 
did they have in common, the solid 
man of science and the towheaded, 
pint-sized, careless lab assistant? He 
had often wondered what evil spirit 
drove him to seek her out, to grope 
torturously for absurd alien phrases, 
never knowing how to begin 
nor — most awful of all — how and 
when to finish. Still, he had to 
search for her, had to speak to her, 
had to look at her ... 

“Why are you still here?” he 
asked in muffled voice. “You know 



GALAXY 




the building’s power transmission is 
off.” 

She looked down at him from the 
height of the windowsill and an- 
swered briefly, “I’m not drawing 
power.” 

Now / wonder, thought Astor, 
what / am going to do with this 
scene tonight when all this will 
happen not in life but in my story. 
When I will no longer be myself but 
someone younger and more likeable 
and without that stupid name 
Astor-it sounds like an aristocratic 
dog-but instead. Star, who looks 
like the brave captain from an old 
trashy novel and who is endowed 
with every blessing / myself lack. 
I’ve already taken care of the 
girl — i changed her from skinny, 
towheaded Rika into Regina, the 
golden-blonde beauty. But what will 
I do with this dialogue? Can / let 
her be so impertinent in my story? 

“Get along home,” he ordered 
sternly. “Assistants are not sup- 
posed to remain in the building 
without the supervision of senior 
staff.” 

“So supervise me,” she said, 
drawing her knees up and sliding 
over to free a bit of windowsill for 
him. “Sit down alongside me and 
supervise.” 

Well, my dear, he thought while 
continuing to stand there, this scene 
I’ll certainly save. Without fail my 
Regina will say, “So supervise 
me ...” And she’ll bare her soul 
on the windowsill . But the dif- 
ference will be that I, or rather not 
/ but Stor, will indeed sit down next 
to her-and what will come next, oh 
my, what will come next .... It’s 
trite enough to make you sick, to 
make your hair curl, but I’ll write it 

THE DEFECTOR 



anyhow. To hell with literature. 

“Listen, young lady,” he said, 
sensing beforehand that he would 
say the wrong thing, “I’ve advised 
you to change your profession. 
Don’t waste your time; you’ll never 
make a good physicist. You don’t 
have that sort of personality.” 

“I don’t plan to be a good physi- 
cist,” she said without embarrass- 
ment. “I’m only starting with that. 
Afterward I’m going to become a 
Real Writer, like you.” 

He looked at her with surprise. 
At the Institute he never spoke of 
his second profession — he corrected 
himself — of his second state. “That 
is much harder than being a physi- 
cist,” he said slowly. “A person 
can write for a whole lifetime and 
still not become a Real Writer.” 

“So I’ll write all my life.” 

“But first you have to learn to 
write on paper. Writing on paper is 
torture. You know so much about 
your protagonist that you can no 
longer tell whether you have man- 
aged to imply, to suggest, every- 
thing that will not fit into the 
printed words. The connotations are 
there because everything that you 
were thinking while you wrote your 
novel, or even your little short 
story, is always inside you. When 
you re-read what you wrote, a 
thousand associations spring up in 
your head. Whether you wish it or 
not, they create the interlacing of 
sounds, smells, sensations and de- 
sires that turn the written word into 
living flesh. But all this happens 
only for you. How can you tell 
whether it works for the average 
reader? 

“And even to yourself your own 
stuff can sound entirely different, 

29 




depending on whether it’s handwrit- 
ten or typed or in print. Just try to 
tell where you came out sounding 
human and where you got nowhere. 
You write and write, tortured by 
what you haven’t managed to say, 
and one fine day you decide to 
chuck the whole damned business 
because it’s obvious that nothing is 
ever going to come of it, and 
then — out of the blue — there’s a de- 
cision by the Council of the Writ- 
ers’ Union that you’ve earned the 
status of a Real Writer. And then 
you stop writing on paper.” 

‘‘I want to be just like you,” 
Rika repeated stubbornly. “I want 
to be a Real Writer and create liv- 
ing people.” 

She's still just a girl, thought As- 
tor. Still Just foolish. At a particular 
age they all want to fly to Uranus 
or go down into the magma or be- 
come a Real Writer. Usually this 
clears up before they’re sixteen. Half 
of them do waste paper on verse or 
prose but only exceptions ever get 
beyond paper. Single exceptions on 
the entire planet. And the rest of 
them get past the phase. This girl 
will get past too, by herself, so 
there’s no need to say anything. 
Trying to talk a girl out of the wish 
to be something is a thankless 
task-and a useless one to boot. 

“It’s not enough Just to want 
to create living people.” He heard 
his didactic tone with surprise. 
“That right is conferred by the 
Writer’s Union and even then it is 
not for life. They give it and they 
can take it away. Furthermore, there 
are very few women among the 
Real Writers. Probably this is be- 
cause women have the opportunity 
to create living people by another, 

30 



more natural means, and this works 
out better for them.” 

Rika blushed so vividly that it 
frightened Astor but she only 
elapsed her knees more firmly to 
her breast and waited until it 
seemed to her that the flush had 
disappeared — in actual fact, it re- 
mained for another ten minutes — 
and once again she repeated stub- 
bornly and vehemently, “I want to 
and I will, I want to and 1 will. 
They will be my people, all mine. I 
will invent them, make them 
breathe, move, suffer. I’ll make 
them live like humans. Do you un- 
derstand? I’ll teach them to live the 
way I want.” 

“I understand,” Astor said 
slowly. “I daydreamed about that 
myself. I dreamed about how my 
.characters would live. I dreamed 
about how I would bring them into 
the wide world. I knew before hand 
just how indecently I would love 
them. But like you, I forgot that 
sooner or later 1 would have to kill 
them.” 

Instantly he regretted his words, 
not because of Rika but simply be- 
cause he wanted to relax and not 
think about anything until he got 
home. Now he would not have even 
a few minutes’ peace. The thing that 
had tormented him subconsciously 
during the day — when he had his 
physics to think about — had broken 
out into the open. 

All this must have shown on his 
face because Rika lowered her legs 
from the windowsill, jumped onto 
the floor and moved toward him. 
She had a strange, contorted expres- 
sion on her face. 

“Ah, well,” he said, and with a 
wave of his hand he walked past 

GALAXY 




her, out of the Institute building, 
down the short pine lane toward 
home, where the dictaphone with 
the direct line to the Writers’ Union 
studio was waiting for him. 

He wondered what he was going 
to do. His story had come to its nat- 
ural ending — and that ending meant 
the end of his Stor. An ending did 
not have to be “unhappy” — “zap! 
zap!” or a dessert-spoonful of 
poison. It could be otherwise, like 
“So they were married and they all 
lived happily ever after.” An end- 
ing was when the hero — whom you 
had nursed and raised, whom you 
had stood on his feet and taught to 
work wonders you could not per- 
form yourself — went down the sec- 
tion of road you had marked off for 
him. A culmination, a denouement, 
and he was no longer your faithful 
subject. He no longer had anything 
to do with you. He was not yours 
any more. 

And so you walk for days and 
torture yourself before placing that 
final period, and you look for a way 
of making your hero, if not al- 
together immortal, then at least 
mortal in a human fashion. And you 
can’t come up with an anwer and 
you put it off and put it off, until 
there comes a day like today, when 
you absolutely have to finish the 
story. Because a Real Writer has no 
business dying before he has settled 
the fate of his hero. This was harsh 
but fair. Otherwise everyone would 
try to leave his work unfinished .so 
his hero could live the illusory life 
of the Writers’ Union studio, live jn 
a world of scenery and the projected 
three-dimensional figures that rep- 
resented minor characters, but live 
even so. 

the defector 



It was a painful business, to cut 
off the existence of your own hero, 
and accordingly the opportunity to 
be a Real Writer was offered only 
to very courageous people. Astor 
did not put himself in this category 
but evidently others thought that he 
belonged there. He was right and 
they were wrong. His first story not 
written on paper, but instead played 
out by the living people he had 
created, had been winding down for 
a long time. But Astor did not have 
the nerve to end it. 

Today he had to do it because his 
laboratory had scheduled an exper- 
iment for tomorrow that could turn 
out rather badly. Astor would per- 
form it himself — he alone knew 
how great the risk was. 

Tomorrow could be it. 

So today he had to finish off 
Stor. 

Astor reached his doorstep and 
looked back. The bulk of the Insti- 
tute building, surrounded by pines, 
towered like a snowy mountain. 
Probably Rika had climbed back 
onto the windowsill and was follow- 
ing him with her eyes. Towheaded 
Rika, whom he had to see once a 
day. Where had she learned about 
his second state? And then that “I 
want to create living people.” In 
the studio you did not call your 
characters “living people.” You 
said “specialized biorobots” or 
“material images.” 

But of course they really were 
living people and they led lives 
that, although brief and preplanned, 
were damnably vivid and enviable. 
Like Stor. 

Astor sat down, drew the dic- 
taphone over to himself and sud- 
denly felt ... a strange, improba- 



31 




ble sensation of momentary omnipo- 
tence. Damn it all, you’re a human 
being, by no means stupid, and 
more or less talented. A Real Writ- 
er, to boot. So find a way out, do 
the impossible, save your Stor. 
There is still time. And don’t drag 
out all these love affairs, window- 
sills and golden curls. The impor- 
tant thing is Stor. Save him! 

He switched on the dictaphone. 
“As he left the Institute,’’ he be- 
gan, “Stor Elamit knew that never 
again, neither now nor later, would 
he ever see Regina.” So much for 
that blonde bitch, he thought. I'll 
dematerialize her without mercy. 

“He walked quickly along the 
lane and when it ended at the door 
to his house, he turned and walked 
around to the landing platform. 
There, every evening from five 
o’clock on, a small sports mobile 
waited for him. He lifted the car 
into the air and twenty minutes later 
was at the place where the smoky 
wall around the Writers’ Union 
studio rose up past the dense pines. 
The wall enclosed several hundred 
square kilometers and consequently 
it seemed to be quite straight so that 
from a distance of a few score 
paces, it was impossible to tell 
which way it curved — toward the 
observer or away from him. The 
wall reached high into the sky and 
perpetual low clouds merged with 
it, making its outlines infinite. Here 
Stor had met with Regina for the 
first time and now he unconsciously 
sought out the very spot — and 
began to wait, not knowing himself 
for what. He sat directly on the 
short, dry moss and occasionally 
brushed from his shoes the enor- 
mous winered ants that stubbornly 

32 



forged straight over them.” 

Astor thought a bit. Perhaps he 
should add something? He turned 
off the dictaphone. The paragraph 
was accepted and entered at the 
studio. Now, perhaps, the 
cybereditors had already decoded it 
and were preparing the needed props: 
a mobile for the flight and the 
old sets — a duplicate of the road 
from the Institute to Astor’s house, 
the landing platform behind the 
house and, later, the grove by the 
wall itself. This last would not be a 
set, but nature, so rare in the 
studio. 

It was time. 

Astor went out of the house, 
brought the car out of the garage 
and soared sharply upward. He 
headed not for the main studio 
building but for the wall, seeking 
precisely the place that shortly his 
Stor should approach from the other 
side. 

Astor did not like to fly at high 
altitude. The busy routes lay to 
one side and much higher and con- 
sequently he could peacefully look 
down through the transparent floor 
of the car and try to imagine what 
was happening at the studio. 

Yesterday he had left Stor in his 
laboratory. The dialogue with Re- 
gina stank. You could tell that it 
only killed time. The segment 
ended with Stor swearing a blue 
streak and driving Regina back to 
her working place. 

So right now, before the start of 
the new episode, the cybereditors 
were inserting into Stor’s memory 
everything that he had “done” be- 
tween the conversation with Regina 
and the time he left the Institute. 
Perhaps apparatus invisible to Stor 

GALAXY 




had already started working and the 
take had begun. Perhaps Stor was 
obediently skirting around his house 
as Astor had dictated, then getting 
into his mobile. Perhaps the mobile 
was taking off — not up into the sky 
as a real mobile would but only a 
few meters. Perhaps then a se- 
quence taken earlier would be pro- 
jected and it would seem to Stor 
that the ground was growing dis- 
tant, that towns and groves were 
sweeping past, that roads and canals 
reached out in man-made straight 
lines. In fact, however, his prop 
mobile would move only a few- 
score meters to the side, toward a 
place where real trees grew along 
the forbidden smoky wall. All this 
would take no longer than thirty 
seconds since it would not do to 
make a viewer watch a character sit 
in a car for a whole half-hour; but 
when Stor landed, he would have 
the feeling that the flight had lasted 
twenty minutes — exactly as Astor 
had dictated. 

A red warning-light flashed on 
the dashboard. The radar had sensed 
the wall ahead. Astor began to land 
the mobile. The trees were so dense 
that only with difficulty did the car 
force its way down through the 
thick branches, finally hovering half 
a meter above the dry moss. 

Astor Elamit got out of the 
mobile. 

He had never before been close 
to the wall. Now it was right next 
to him, a mere three or four paces 
away, and the last trees grew almost 
on top of it. 

Astor took two steps and reached 
the wall itself. Casually he glancecL 
around — -then stopped dead in sur- 
prise. The final row of trees, those 

THE DEFECTOR 



closest to the wall, were not whole. 
If you faced them from the direction 
of the mobile, they were ordinary 
trees, alive and three-dimensional. 
But by the wall itself it could be 
seen that these were only halves, 
cut off by an invisible vertical 
plane. The cuts were not Jjare but 
covered with a violet-colored sub- 
stance. Astor could not resist tap- 
ping on this covering with his fin- 
gertips. There was a muffled sound, 
as if the half-trees were hollow. He 
stood still for a while, trying to un- 
derstand, until he decided that these 
were prop trees, probably brought 
outside the studio because real, live 
vegetation might have gradually 
worked its way through the wall. 

But there was no time to consider 
the maner further. Over there, be- 
yond the wall, Stor had already ar- 
rived since in the films shot in the 
studio, time flowed differently than 
it did in the lives of ordinary 
people. Sometimes the flow was 
slower and a half-hour in a charac- 
ter’s life would be broken down 
into a multitude of minute episodes, 
seemingly insignificant if taken in- 
dividually. But two forces — a be- 
nign direction from without and a 
pitiless necessity from within — 
threaded these bits together. These 
minutes of fictional life, their sig- 
nificance multiplied by the slowness 
of action, loomed close to the view- 
er as if magnified. 

But more often it was the other 
way around and the characters’ years 
were handled in hours — not encom- 
passing all the trifles and details of 
those years but only those elements 
-that accorded with the writer’s task 
of fitting a whole life into the short 
time-slot allotted. And of course 



33 




time, for the material characters — 

There you go! thought Astor with 
surprise. How did that slip out? Up 
to this point / have been calling 
them “living people.’’ And now, be- 
fore this wall, I automatically use 
that indecent term, “material char- 
acter.” No. It's not so. They are 
living people, unusual only in the 
fact that they are entirely subject to 
their author. Or at that, not en- 
tirely. After all, think of all the 
times an author has the feeling that 
his character is breaking away from 
him, that the words and actions dic- 
tated for the character simply will 
not do. Sometimes an author even 
recognizes that his very own brain- 
child is forcing him to scrap the 
plot he has worked out with loving 
care because the character can act 
in only one way. So the author ac- 
cepts this action and submits to the 
choice of his offspring. If the au- 
thor, is sensitive of course. There is 
another type of writer who, in spite 
of everything, will force his charac- 
ters to act unnaturally, out of keep- 
ing with their psychologies. Usually 
that’s the last work by such an au- 
thor. They take away his Real 
Writer status and forbid him use of 
the studio. 

Astor Elamit could not keep 
himself — he would have lo forfeit 
his Real Writer status. He had no 
alternative. Stor was dearer to him 
than his own self. He had to save 
him, regardless of the price, regard- 
less of whether Stor himself would 
really want it. He must do it. 

Astor took another step forward 
and was so close to the wall that 
even a half-step would have 
plunged his face into the jelly-like 
mass. His cheeks gave an occa- 

34 



sional twitch as if it was an enor- 
mous smoke-colored Jellyfish hang- 
ing there before him. He must go 
into that unmoving haze. Once 
again must. 

But why, up to this moment, had 
he never asked himself if it were 
possible to do so? He had always 
taken it for granted. He knew a 
great deal about the studio. He 
knew everything — or thought he 
knew everything — about the ones 
who, by the will of the Real Writ- 
ers, had received the right to life 
within the walls of this studio, the 
right to live a life infinitely more 
vivid, and filled the actions infi- 
nitely more consequential, than 
those of ordinary people. He had 
repeated this last point to himself 
hundreds of times. 

But what did he really know 
about the wall? He searched his 
memory. There was no corner 
where the knowledge would be hid- 
ing. 

He felt as if he had once known 
but now had forgotten. Nothing. 
Only the feeling that if he crossed 
to the other side, he would lose 
forever his right to create living 
people. And even that was not 
knowledge but only a guess. 

Why had he never known what 
the wall was? More important, 
could he, or dared he, walk into it? 

He hesitated, expecting that 
somewhere inside himself the an- 
swer would emerge. But it was 
nowhere to be found, and instead 
Astor became acutely aware' of a 
gap, an empty place without' memo- 
ry, as if after a faint. Then he 
sensed a growing feeling of the im- 
possibility, of the impermissibility, 
of what he was planning to do. Not 

GALAXY 




allowing himself to be deflected, he 
stretched out his arms as do people 
groping through a fog and stepped 
into the smoky substance of the 
wall. For the first moment he could 
see nothing. Then the smoke 
cleared and he found himself in an 
incredible crystalline void. There 
was a fine silvery film under his 
feet — and absolutely nothing around 
him. He had always thought that in 
such instances people must be hor- 
rified, but he felt only uncertainty. 
He walked forward quickly, still 
holding out his arms, before him 
and after a few paces he again en- 
countered a zone of smoke that had 
arisen seemingly out of nowhere; 
and once again the smoke cleared 
and Astor knew with certainty that 
he was now on the other side. 

And that’s all there is to it, he 
said to himself. Very simple. So a 
human being could in practice walk 
right through the wall, though he 
would be penalized for it by exclu- 
sion from all work. Well, that was 
no small price. But what about 
biorobots? Could they also go 
through the wall? Wouldn’t it have 
been simpler to order Stor to come 
to him, out into the world of men? 

Somehow this had not occurred 
to" him earlier. Probably it was im- 
possible. Probably. Again he felt 
strangely vague. There was a gap in 
his mind. Why did he not know 
such an important thing about his 
Stor? 

Thinking about Stor returned him 
to action. There was no time for 
contemplation. He was in the 
studio, on forbidden ground. Now 
the only things that mattered were 
speed and elusiveness. First he must 
find Stor. After that he could find 

THE DEFECTOR 



out whether or not a biorobot could 
walk through the wall — the wall he 
himself had come through without 
learning a thing about it. 

Astor Elamit moved forward, 
seeking the place that he had twice 
described in his story — the gnarled 
stump. Stor was obliged to be sit- 
ting on it. 

He began to feel uneasy. Uneasy, 
indeed! He was scared, scared as he 
had been only in childhood, when 
you’re plunging down into an abyss 
. .and a rubber, invisible thing is 
breaking up in front of you. .and 
you’re falling and falling. .and 
light, icy bubbles go through your 
body and rush upward, up to where 
you will never return because ev- 
erything. .everything. .is ruined 
and it’s all your fault .... 

Astor realized that this was the 
wrong place. 

Suddenly he had no desire to 
search any further, to shout out, to 
call Stor’s name. It was useless. 
The area of the studio was several 
hundred square kilometers. And 
where should he look? To the right? 
To the left? Why had he been so 
sure that he would enter at exactly 
the place where Stor would be wait- 
ing? How had he known that he had 
to come through the wall at pre- 
cisely this spot? 

It was strange, but earlier he had 
been so confident. Now he felt noth- 
ing, precisely nothing, not even 
the desire to go back. Astor 
lurched. Trampling bushes, heedless 
of obstacles, he moved to one side, 
slipping over dry mold sprinkled 
with last year’s pine needles. He 
stopped when he came out onto a 
bare, sunlit hill. Before him, with 
eyes half closed as if he were laz- 



35 




ily sunning himself, sat an old man. 

That does it, thought Astor dis- 
mally. He had wandered into an 
area in use. They were shooting 
here — it was probably some telling 
psychological moment, with all the 
invisible cameras in for the close- 
up. In fifteen minutes or so the take 
would be processed, at which time 
the cybereditor would automatically 
give the alarm since the sequence 
would show an extraneous person. 
And that would be it. 

Astor looked again at the old 
man. Would he be surprised to meet 
a stranger? Or suppose the old man 
was from another era? Maybe the 
story performed here was set fifty 
years ago. The old man’s muted 
black suit gave no indication. 

But the elder simply watched 
Astor approach. He showed no hint 
of surprise but rather a certain 
satisfaction. He had been watching 
Astor right along but Astor had not 
realized it because of the other’s 
half-closed eyes. Old people who 
are very tired often watch in that 
way. 

Astor moved still closer. 

“Have a seat,’’ said the old man. 
He moved over slightly on the trunk 
of the fallen pine, although there 
had been enough room as it was. 
Astor slowly brought one leg over 
the trunk and sat astride. Reddish 
flakes of bark, warmed by the sun, 
showered down like the scales of a 
great golden fish. So this is what 
they're like, thought Astor as he 
forthrightly studied the old man. 
This is what they're like, the ones 
that we create with the dubious 
power of our imaginations. Later 
we see them as three-dimensional 
figures on the stereo screen, realis- 

36 



tic as hell. But we never meet them 
like this, made out of flesh and 
blood. This is an intermediate pro- 
cess excised from the creative act. 
And probably it has to be that way 
because if an author had once met 
his hero the way I have run into 
this old man, he would be incapable 
of forcing him to live and think and 
feel and so on. To the technical 
personnel of the studio, to biodesig- 
ners, neuroplicators, psi-link 
operators, they remain simply theat- 
rical biorobots — remote-controlled, 
non-feedback anthropoid automata, 
how little we understand — no, not 
“little"; there’s no degree. Either 
you understand or you don't — that 
how little we understand-no, not 
“little"; there’s no degree. Either 
you understand or your odn’t — that 
however strange or painful it may 
be to us, these are really living 
people. 

The old man continued to look 
straight ahead, not glancing at As- 
tor, and his small, old hands had 
their own special way of lying 
helplessly on his knees. He’s even 
older than he looks, thought Astor. 
And things in general seem strange. 
For instance I’ve seen this old man 
somewhere before. Though why 
should that be strange? I couldn’t 
have seen the old man himself — 
after all, he’s a theatrical biorobot, 
a material image, damn it! But he 
could have a prototype. Him I’ve 
definitely seen. Not at the Institute 
or Td remember more clearly. So at 
the Writers’ Union. Come to that, 
what would happen if / up and ask 
him who he is? 

Astor was about to open his 
mouth when the old man slowly 
turned to him and said, “Very well 

GALAXY 




then, I shall have to introduce my- 
self first.” Again he looked off into 
the distance, barely moving his lipS 
as if he expected that Astor would 
interrupt him. But Astor waited, 
“you see,” said the old man fi- 
nally, “I am a writer. Somehow it 
has always been awkward to admit 
that.” He smiled guiltily and his 
hands trembled with uneasiness. ”1 
am a Real Writer. Or more pre- 
cisely, 1 was a Real Writer.” 

Yes, thought Astor. So was /. But 
now they'll toss me out of the Union 
on my ear and the worst of it is that 
it will all be for nothing. I’m not 
worth crap. I couldn’t bring off one 
stinking thing. 

“1 authored many books,” the 
old man continued. “1 was permit- 
ted to materialize the last three. 
Now 1 am trying to decide which is 
the most important part, the most 
joyful part, of the process of creat- 
ing a Real book. Is it when you 
have just decided to write a new 
book, before you know where it’s 
going or exactly what it’ll be about, 
but you know that it will be your 
new book. .or is it the birth of the 
plot? Or the moment when the hero 
appears? Which is dearer, his ap- 
pearance in your imagination or 
your first meeting with him on the 
stereo screen?” 

It’s funny, thought Astor. Funny. 
Now he’s talking with me, with an 
extra person not forseen by the au- 
thor. So this isn't the author’s 
monolog. These are thoughts that 
are independent of the will of the 
person who created this old man. 

frightening. Not funny but 
frightening. 

“In the same way, I did not 
know who of the many characters I 

the defector 



had begotten was the nearest and 
dearest. Not until recently. Not until 
the time came for me to part with 
the last one. Then I discovered that 
this last one was so close and so 
necessary to me that parting with 
him, watching him disappear, was 
not merely on a par with my own 
death, but was still more frighten- 
ing. Afterward there would come an 
emptiness in which my life would 
continue without joy.” 

You’re an idiot, Astor suddenly 
thought with unexpected cruelty. 
You destroy the person you created 
and guided through life. Your hands 
tremble; they couldn’t hurt a fly; 
while at the same time over there 
he’s being dematerialized . Or not 
"there,” here. It’s happening here, 
in the studio. Just as it will to my 
Stor in a little while. We’re both 
idiots. I myself didn’t get a thing 
done either. I couldn’t hack it. Not 
enough brains. What a piece of 
crap I am! I sit here and lis- 
ten ... 

”1 put myself into him,” the old 
man continued in a monotone. “Or 
no, it was something a little bet- 
ter .. and a little younger. I 
couldn’t make him a young man — 
I’ve likely forgotten even how to 
daydream about that. He was the 
way 1 would like to be now if such 
a miracle were possible. 
Middleaged, no genius, no world 
celebrity, but simply a man honestly 
doing his work. Most important, I 
wanted to give him my pain, all the 
pain with which you create a char- 
acter and with which you go away 
from him . .” 

/ don’t understand him any more, 
Astor thought mechanically. He’s a 
writer himself and his character is a 



37 




writer, so ... But damn it. he’s 
not a real person. Someone created 
him. It's all nonsense. It’s like one 
matreshka doll inside another. 

“Pardon me, but you haven’t in- 
troduced yourself,” said Astor. 

“I’m a Real Writer,” the old 
man said sadly. 

“You said that already.” 

“I am a real Real Writer.” Rav- 
ing. .Astor rubbed his forehead 
and winced as if in pain. .And 
then it came to him. This was sim- 
ply a human being! A human being, 
the same as himself! Just like Astor, 
he had crossed the forbidden boun- 
dary to save someone. Now there 
were two of them. Together they 
would think something up. Together 
they could still get something done. 

“And your name?” he almost 
shouted. 

“Castor Elamit,” said the old 
man. Astor rose. Slowly he drew 
his leg back across the tree trunk, 
glanced at his hands and hid them 
in his pockets. It seemed as if the 
smoky haze of the wall had come 
out from behind the trees, had 
started to crawl toward them. 

“Yes. .” said Astor. 

“Yes . That’s a very fun- 

ny .. coincidence.” 

The old man did not answer. 

“You .... are .... Castor 
Elamit. .Yes. But just who am I, 
then?” 

Again the old man did not an- 
swer. 

“ And where did I come from?” 

Silently the old man gazed at the 
gray wall that lost itself among the 
clouds. On the other side of the 
wall grew trees that existeed only in 
halves. Or they didn’t “grow.” 
They simply stood there, props. 

38 



Only living things can grow. No 
proof, no explanation, was neces- 
sary. One had only to recall those 
tree halves to understand that the 
studio was over there, on the other 
side of the wall. And this, this was 
the world of humans. 

“Do you want me to say it my- 
self? All right. A biorobot. A non- 
feedback anthropoid automaton, 
created in the image and likeness of 
his author. Exactly as I myself 
created my Stor. A bit younger and 
a bit . better. Right? And your 
first name, which you shortened by 
one letter. ...” 

Still, it was improbable. Espe- 
cially once it had been said aloud. 
To think that you are only a robot is 
frightening. But when you say it 
aloud, it becomes simply an absur- 
dity, and you have only to talk, talk, 
talk so that the sound of the words 
will mark out their absurdity with 
maximum vividness. 

“So the world 1 have lived in up 
to this time is the world of scenery, 
sound effects, material images? The 
world of mockups and location 
footage? The world of nonexistent 
distances and altitudes? The world 
of childhoods that never were, of 
invented love affairs?” He stopped. 
Rika. His Rika and the impossibility 
of living for even one day without 
catching a glimpse of her .... 

“So even Rika was a fiction?” 
he asked in a whisper. 

“Yes,” said the old man. “I 
gave you what I myself had 
dreamed of having. It wouldn’t mat- 
ter exactly what she were like, so 
long as she was young, quite 
young, improbably young. .just to 
look at here, just to look once a 
day. ...”

“1 see.” Astor’s voice was calm. 
“Just to look at her once a day. So 
even that was yours. Nothing was 
my own. Yes, of course. I’m be- 
ginning to understand. Alien words. 

I said to her another man’s stupid 
words. But what was my own? Was 
there anything? 

“Astor,” said the old man in the 
tone that one uses with small chil- 
dren, “From the moment you 
crossed the wall, you ceased to be 
mine.” 

“Well, please accept my heartfelt 
gratitude,” said Astor. “Thank you 
for fifteen minutes of unowned ex- 
istence, which has not even been 
enough time for me to become my- 
self. But just why did you do it? 
You, better than anyone, should 
know that the loss of a biorobot will 
not go unnoticed, even if by some 
miracle I managed to work my way 
into the human world. They’ll go 
looking for me, and 1 think they’ll 
find me without much trouble. And 
then what? Dematerialization on the 
spot, without trial or testimony? Or 
what do you humans do with robots 
who have found free will?” 

“Don’t go on like that,” the old 
man said. “Astor, don't.” 

“Forgive me,” he replied. 
“Momentary curiousity. Anyway, 1 
have to return. Tomorrow is the day 
of the experiment — my last 

experiment — which you thought up 
but which I am going to perform. 
Right?” 

“Yes.” The old man nodded. “It 
will be tomorrow. Before I came 
here, I finished the book.” 

“Thank you. I’ll try to play it out 
with as much realism as possible.” 
“No need for the bravado, my 
lad. Don’t try to look better than I. 

THE DEFECTOR 



It’s enough that you’re younger.” 
“Better. ?” Astor heard him- 
self laugh. “Why the hell did you 
have to drag me over to this side? 
Everything could have happened the 
way you willed it to tomorrow, but 
why did 1 have to learn that I am 
just — as we Real Writers say — a 
theatrical biorobot, a remote- 
controlled anthropoid automaton?” 
“Yes,” the old man said softly, 
almost as if talking to himself. “I 
suppose it was inevitable. I put into 
you not only my own soul but all 
the other qualities I thought I would 
have needed for absolute perfection, 
and yet somehow you turned out 
smaller and weaker than myself.” 
“Sorry,” Astor said simply. 
“It’s almost time for my tomorrow. 
If you can, please allow me to 
be . myself . .for a bit 
longer.” 

“My lad — ” The old man rose 
ponderously and stood up next to 
Astor. “ — you are forgetting that 
the time of the . .” He hesitated. 
“. .the ones on the other side of 
the wall flows much more quickly 
than human time. Astor Elamit’s 
tomorrow begins in twenty minutes.” 
“I see,” said Astor. “I must 
hurry. I’m supposed to be at the In- 
stitute?” 

“Of course.” The old man 
smiled sadly. “It was the simplest 
exit.” 

“The barrier won’t hold?” 

“No, my lad. .” 

“Meaning .... annihilation 
. .Damn it all, it’s trite! And if 
I’m not mistaken you call yourself a 
physicist?” 

“I had no time for anything else, 
Astor. You know that a Real Writer 
must not le^ve his book unfinished. 



39 




And I ... I am very old and sick, 
and the time has come when the au- 
tomedic can find no way to arrest 
the development of my disease. I 
came to you while 1 still had the 
strength for it. 1 had to see about 
your future, and now 1 have done 
so. Farewell, my lad.” 

He lifted his small, light hands, 
and somewhat ceremoniously lay 
them on Astor’s shoulders. They 
stood that way for a short while, 
and then Astor cautiously grasped 
the hands, squeezed them gently as 
if he were afraid of inflicting pain, 
and let them go. 

‘‘Well, I’ll be going,” he said. 

‘‘You haven’t understood me, my 
lad. I’m the one who’s going over 
there.” 

‘‘Where?” Astor asked in confu- 
sion. 

The old man nodded as if they 
say, ‘‘Over there, my child,” and 
started to walk toward the wall, 
whose smoky haze arose behind the 
farthest trees. 

“No!” cried Astor and barred his 
path. “No!” 

The old man moved close and 
Astor grabbed him by the shoulder. 

“There are less than twenty min- 
utes left,” the old man said calmly. 
“1 am not merely a physicist but 
one of those who created the Writ- 
ers’ Union studio, who raised its 
wall and programmed its robots. As 
a result, 1 was able to upset the 
focus of the cameras and the ob- 
serving apparatus. Because of this, 1 
enabled you to come out here and 
when I return in your place, it will 
not be noticed. But the general 
course of action in my book has al- 
ready been dictated and it is not 
possible to change it. Someone has 

40 



to return and play it out to the 
end.” 

“It will be me,” declared Astor. 
“And don’t make me use force.” 
“Yes, I made you younger and 
stronger than I.” The old man 
raised his head and looked straight 
into Astor’s eyes. “But 1 am a 
man, and you cannot walk my 
road.” 

He shook off Astor’s hands and 
walked toward the wall, holding 
himself as erect as possible. Astor 
watched him go, not daring to move 
from the spot. His thoughts were 
muddled; one contested with 
another and the result was a shape- 
less morass. The natural argument, 
the unanswerable argument that 
would give Astor the right to halt 
the old man, would not crystallize. 
But Astor felt with all his being that 
he did have such a right; only its 
basis eluded him. The old man had 
already reached the last row of 
trees. He looked back and called 
loudly, “Farewell, Astor Elamit!” 
And Astor remembered. “Stop!” 
he shouted and rushed toward the 
old man. “I can’t let you go in my 
place; I still have my Stor.” 

The old man looked at him with 
surprise. 

“Now I understand why I didn’t 
find him here,” Astor continued. 
“This is the world of humans, and 
he is only a biorobot. So he’s over 
there, on the territory of the studio, 
and I’m going back to find him. 
He’s the only thing I’ve got.” 
“No,” said the old man, “you 
have not got your Stor. He also is 
mine, just like the childhood you 
remember, the laws of physics you 
use, like your need to see Rika 
... he is not yours.” 



GALAXY 




“True. Everything is your idea. 
Even Stor. You willed it and so I 
played Real Writer and created liv- 
ing people. But the pain I felt for 
him was mine. Pain belongs to the 
loser, not the creator.” 

“What you feel is only the echo 
of the pain 1 suffered over you.” 

“To hell with it if it wasn’t 
mine! Rake in everything for your- 
self! Everything! There’s no time 
to bargain. You can have everything 
that was. But what will be, the few 
minutes that remain before the ex- 
plosion, are mine. What will you do 
for Stor if you go?” 

“Nothing,” the old man said 
calmly. 

“But I'll do something! Every- 
thing I can. I’ll find him. .” 
“You will not find him because 
he does not exist to be found. The 
difference between you and Stor is 
that you are a material character and 
he is not. He lives only on paper 
and in your imagination.” 

“So,” Astor said slowly. “The 
last matreshka doll turns out to be 
empty. Nothing inside. But how 
do you live in this world, in any 
world, if there’s nothing inside?” 
“My lad, it has noryet been an 
hour since you became a real per- 
son, but everything that you have 
experienced in that time is yours. 
And the future, after I go, is also 
yours. I leave you my name and my 
right to use the Union studio. You 
do not yet have your Stor. But you 
can create him.” 

Shaken, Astor remained silent. 
“But if you do decide to save 
this Stor, your Stor, remember this: 
A theatrical biorobot cannot cross 
the boundary into the human world. 
The order simply would not be 

THE DEFECTOR 



passed by the cybereditors who re- 
view all the material as it reaches 
the studio. And if by some blunder 
they did let it pass, no biorobot 
would accept such an order — he 
wouldn’t obey it. That is how they 
are programmed.” 

“But what about me?” Astor 
asked in confusion. 

“Remember where you were go- 
ing. You wanted to get not to the 
human world but to a world of im- 
aginary characters. You wanted to 
meet not your creator but your own 
creation. If human beings had re- 
viewed the text of my last transmis- 
sion, they like as not would have 
caught onto my trick. But I man- 
aged to fool the computers. Re- 
member, this is the only way out 
and 1 found it only because 1 myself 
designed and created the studio’s 
barrier zone. It is useless for a 
human being to cross the boundary. 
The cyberobservers would not allow 
him to meet a single biorobot. Re- 
member this one maneuver. You’ll 
manage to upset the focusing be- 
cause I put into you the whole 
complex of knowledge that I had 
mastered — after all, mornings you 
too were just a physicist.” 

Astor nodded. 

“And don’t hurry. Don’t mess it 
up. Don’t feel it’s something you 
have to do. Fashion your Stor only 
with love and pain. Those are the 
only true ingredients; all the rest is 
unreal. Don’t value him only be- 
cause he is yours. He must be 
worth going after. And when you 
know that he is really worth that, 
you will know how to save him.” 

For a while longer they stood si- 
, lently, simply looking at one 
another. Then the old man stepped 



41 




forward and disappeared into the 
smoky depth of the wall. 

Astor waited. The hidden rustl- 
ings of the evening forest sur- 
rounded him and he strained with 
all his might to catch a whisper of 
what was happening on the other 
side of the wall. No hint came, no 
clue. Still Astor waited. Then a 
strange memory gently surfaced 
from his subconsicous: On the other 
side the forest never made 



noise. .! He swayed — as if the 
recollection had given him a light 
interior shove — as if the recollection 
had given him a light interior 
shove — and started to walk away. 
He walked faster and faster, without 
looking back. For all his human 
life that place was so impressed on 
his memory that he knew he could 
find it immediately and withouf mis- 
take when the time came to re- 
turn. ★ 




Why should the devil

Vibrant animal magnetism made 
the Senator seem much younger 
than his forty-four years. Following 
the Secret Service agents who 
bulldozed a path for him through 
the crowd, he grabbed the hands 
reaching out to him. 

Then, wonder of wonders, he 
leaned over the railing and reached 
out toward me! For one fantastic 
moment the blue eyes under that 
famous thatch of light brown hair 
(gray in real life) seemed to be on 
me, taking me in. Then he reached 
past my outstretched arm, pressed 
the hand of the man behind me, that 
of the man next to him, and the 
next. Everyone’s but mine. 

And I had driven since dawn for 
a glimpse of my idol! 

At least I had been able to hear 
his speech over outside loudspeak- 
ers (1 arrived too late to get into the 
auditorium). A crummy speech it 
was, too, full of catchy phrases that 
got roars of applause, but when it 
was all over and you asked yourself 
“What exactly did he say?’’ you 
couldn’t remember a thing. 

Did I want a man like that, an 
empty-headed crowd-pleaser, to be 
my next president? 

Not on your life! Right then and 
there I decided to get even with him 
for ignoring me. But how could an 
eighteen-year-old State College stu- 
dent get even with one of the rich- 



est, most powerful men in the coun- 
try? 

I would just have to find a way. 

it it * 

“Medicine in the middle ages,’’ 
my anthropology teacher said, “was 
a matter of strange nostrums that 
killed as often as they cured, and 
what cures there were could be laid 
to the placebo effect. Is it therefore 
not true that medical intervention 
can save lives? We now know it 
can, once the basic laws of physiol- 
ogy are known. Witchcraft is today 
in the same state that medical sci- 
ence was in during the Middle 
Ages. Is magical intervention there- 
fore impossible? Or will it become 
possible, once the basic laws of the 
universe are known? How many of 
you have read Castaneda? Come 
now, someone must have, there’s 
one or two in every class. Aha, I 
thought so. What did you think — ’’ 

After class I Joined the throng at 
his lectern, and when the bell rang 
and the next class began to file in, I 
followed him to his office with the 
other students whose questions were 
still unanswered. Most were varia- 
tions of “Do you really think 
witchcraft is possible?’’ and his an- 
swers were variations of “Were you 
ever hypnotized? Did you ever have 
a telepathic experience? How do 
you explain that by the known laws 
of modem science?’’ 

For a half hour Doctor Manson 
patiently answered and re-answered 
their questions while I fidgeted in a 
comer, thinking that this was the 
story of my life, to be one of a 
crowd at the feet of an authority 
symbol who pays attention to ev- 
eryone but me.

What was I doing there anyway? 
Was it possible that this chubby lit- 
tle pink-faced man, who had for 
some reason chosen to wear a lilac 
shirt and a purple paisley tie with a 
tan and green plaid suit, could tell 
me anything that would make a dif- 
ference in my life, anything that I 
wanted to know? 

Finally when the last of my fel- 
low students left and Doctor Man- 
son looked at me and said, “Nell 
Wills, isn’t that right?” I was so 
flattered to find he knew my name 
that all the subtle lead-ins I had 
been trying to compose vanished 
from my mind. 

“I’ll get right to the point,” I 
said when I couldn’t think of any- 
thing else to say. “I want to study 
witchcraft. Where do I sign up?” 

“I wish I knew. I’d study it my- 
self. You need an adept, a master, 
someone who can teach you. Unfor- 
tunately, all the adepts I’ve ever 
had a chance to investigate turned 
out to be frauds.” 

“If Uri Geller can do what he 
does, there must be others — ” 

“If that’s the kind of magic you 
want to learn, I can teach you my- 
self,” said Doctor Manson, reach- 
ing toward me. I braced myself for 
a pass, but all he did was to pull an 
enormous silk flower out of my ear. 
“Not that I’ve actually investigated 
Geller myself,” he went on, “but it 
does seem curious that all his so- 
called psychic feats can be dupli- 
cated by any stage magician using 
ordinary legerdemain.” 

With a few quick strokes he 
turned the huge flower into a 
pencil-sized cylinder, tucked it up 
his sleeve, and explained, “I 
worked my way through college 



doing this. However, I don’t think 
you want to waste your life pulling 
artificial flowers out of the ears of 
pretty co-eds. You want to cast love 
spells, put a hex on the man who 
jilted you, something of that sort.” 

I smiled at him sweetly. If he 
only knew! 

“I wish I could help you but I 
can’t,” Doctor Manson went on. 
“Maybe the problem is that sorcery 
isn’t really on a scientific basis yet. 
Somebody has to create one. And it 
might as well be us. With this in 
mind, some of my fellow faculty 
members and I have gotten together 
to form a coven. You’re welcome 
to Join if you like.” 

The idea of me, a mere 
freshman. Joining a coven of col- 
lege professors was overwhelming. 
“Uh — I’m not sure I would be any 
good.” 

“Nonsense. Any blue-eyed red- 
head with a gorgeous tan has to be 
a natural-bom witch! The combina- 
tion doesn’t occur in nature.” 

There was a moment of silence 
while I wondered who he was talk- 
ing about. I have green eyes, my- 
self. 

Then he said, “Besides, don’t 
you think most of the students who 
came in here wanted to study 
witchcraft? But you were the only 
one who said so. The first require- 
ment for a witch is that she have 
guts' enough to say, ‘I want to study 
witchcraft.’ You’ve read Castaneda 
of course?’ ’ 

Not only had I not read Cas- 
taneda Of Course, I didn’t even 
know who he was. 

Doctor Manson Jumped up and 
pulled paperbacks down from his 
bookshelves. When he had an arm- 



THE DEVIL AND ALL HER WORKS 



45 




ful, he turned to me with a sudden 
thought. “Are you one of those 
young girls who reads six books a 
day, or is one a week more like it, 
and then only under duress?” 

1 had to admit 1 was the second 
type. 

Doctor Manson handed me one 
book and put the rest back. “Every- 
thing Castaneda has to say, he says 
in Journey to Ixtlan. Read that. 
Don’t waste your time with Batty, 
or whatever his name is; you know, 
the preposterous tale of the girl who 
must have been possessed by the 
Devil since she used naughty 
words, masturbated, wet her pants, 
and — we mustn’t forget the most 
important sign of all! — she had bad 
breath! If that’s what the author 
thinks evil is, can you imagine what 
his childhood must have been like? 
No, you can’t, can you? You 
haven’t read Freud. Not that I 
would attribute everyone’s problems 
to faulty toilet training, but in this 
case . never mind. Stick with 
Carlito. He’ll tell you where it’s at. 
God, I wish I could study with Don 
Juan! Well, what about the coven? 
Tonight’s our esbat, our weekly 
meeting. Can I pick you up around,^ 
say, sevenish?” 

“Uh — it sounds interesting.” 
Still, I couldn’t understand what a 
bunch of college professors would 
want with a freshman, an eighteen- 
year-old girl. Wait! Wasn’t there 
something about naked virgins? 
“But if you’re looking for someone 
to serve as an alter, I think I ought 
to tell you — ” 

“No! Oh, God! Is that what 
you . oh, no!” Doctor Manson 
hid his very red face in his hands. 
“It’s not that sort of, I mean, it’s 

46 



really very respectable. Jesus! 
Would 1 ask you if— look, 1 know 
you’re a nice girl. ...” 

1 decided not to disillusion him. 

“What we do is more . well, 
learning how to control our lives so 
our lives won’t control us, that sort 
of thing,” Manson said, getting 
himself in hand. “For instance, 1 
suffer from a rare form of color 
blindness, tritanopia. It has embar- 
rassed me all my life, ever since my 
kindergarten teacher bawled me out 
for painting a picture with a green 
sky and blue grass. I honestly 
couldn’t tell the difference, and yet 
she accused me of being a non- 
conformist! Can you believe it? For 
most of us, the worst name we can 
call someone is — well, I don’t want 
to say it now; her worst was ‘non- 
conformist.’ Anyway, I joined the 
coven because I wanted to learn 
how to tell colors with my fingers, 
so — like, I could match up my suits 
and ties, people wouldn’t stare 
when I came into a room, that sort 
of thing. 

“The Russians are really into it, 
but in this country, well, the coven 
group was the only one that didn’t 
make me feel silly. Then, do you 
know what happened? I was getting 
some results but when I’d try a dif- 
ferent set of yams, I couldn’t tell 
the colors apart any more. Colors 
differ so much from dye-lot to dye- 
lot, you see, and the sense of touch 
involves a whole different set of 
parameters. I’m still working it out. 
But anyway. What I started to tell 
you is that all of a sudden it no 
longer mattered. I mean, I happen 
to think this tie goes very well with 
this suit. If you don’t agree, that’s 
your problem, not mine. Do you 

GALAXY 




see what I mean? That’s what 
witchcraft has done for me.” 

I managed to make some sym- 
pathetic noises although it was hard 
to sympathize with someone who 
wanted to get even with his kinder- 
garten teacher when the man I 
wanted to get even with had just 
been elected President of the United 
States. 

After that I had to visit Doctor 
Manson’s coven — his enthusiasm 
wouldn’t let me say no. And the 
coven became the family I never 
had. 

Not that I don’t have a family at 
home. There’s Mom, and Dad, and 
me, and Christy. We’re what is 
called a nuclear family. The only 
time we talk is when we can’t agree 
on which television show to 
watch — unless you count as talking 
the hours Mom spends in comparing 
me to Christy. For my own good, 
of course. Christy’s the good little 
sister. I’m the big bad one, you 
see? Like the time Mom found the 
diaphragm in my dresser. She didn’t 
even think of looking through Chris- 
ty’s drawers. You see? 

As I said, the coven became the 
family I never had. Its grandmaster 
and most famous member was oc- 
togenarian Frederick R. Birch, co- 
author of Reproductive Behavior, 
every undergraduate’s favorite sci- 
entific treatise. If you liked The De- 
cameron, you’ll love Dodge and 
Birch. Everyone else called him 
Fred. I called him Uncle Fred, 
partly out of respect for his age and 
fame but mostly because he liked to 
pat young girls. When he put his 
arm around me, I called him Uncle 
Fred to remind him of how much 
patting I was willing to put up with.

Uncle Fred was so much our guid- 
ing light, we often referred to our- 
selves as the Fred Birch Society. 

Whether or not Uncle Fred actu- 
ally cast love spells on pretty co-eds 
in Psych. 150, as he claimed, or 
conjured up succubi to keep him 
amused while he ran his control 
groups, the projects he arranged for 
the coven were chaste enough. 
Mostly we did yoga exercises. We 
learned how to relax in incredible 
positions, how to visualize a purple 
sphere and watch it turn orange, 
and eventually we graduated to 
out-of-body experiences. Leaving 
his body behind, the coven member 
chosen for the experiment would 
drift into the next room, note the 
objects that were arranged on a 
tray, then return and report. The 
scientists among us wanted to be 
sure we were really out of our 
bodies and not simply imagining the 
experience. 

After a few nights of this, one of 
the scientists observed that we were 
not really controlling for mental 
telepathy. The subject might be 
reading the mind of the person who 
had arranged the tray. Not that we 
would suspect a fellow witch of de- 
liberately lying about her experiences. 
We just wanted to be sure. After 
that we had the out-of-body subject 
visit addresses selected at random 
from the telephone book until she 
found someone at home. Then she 
would return to report the objects 
she had seen on the coffee table. 
The householder was then tele- 
phoned for confirmation. A surpris- 
ingly highly percentage of household- 
ers were willing to cooperate, once 
they were told that a scientific re- 
search group at the College wanted 

48 



to know what was on their living- 
room coffee table. 

We never told them we were a 
witches’ coven. 

Several years later we did some 
witches’ ceremonies after Bea and 
Henry Frankenheimer completed 
their bomb shelter, where we started 
holding meetings. Made of concrete 
sprayed onto a balloon, the shelter 
was egg-shaped for maximum pres- 
sure resistance. Bea had painted the 
rough, round ceiling with cave-art 
Irish elk, woolly mammoths and 
other extinct beasts. Heaps of Peru- 
vian blankets made comfortable 
seats out of chests full of food and 
bottled water, “hope chests’’ Bea 
called them. Batik hangings cur- 
tained off the chemical toilet. 

The egg buried in the ground, the 
primitive art, and the doomed-world 
foreboding that all bomb shelters 
invoke combined to put us in the 
mood for occult and mystical expe- 
riences. The mood was hard to sus- 
tain, however. We felt nervous and 
self-conscious calling up demon 
gods of yore with the help of what 
little fire and incense the shelter’s 
air-conditioning system could han- 
dle. Invariably someone would start 
giggling or toss off a witticism that 
got everyone else giggling, and any 
power our combined minds had 
managed to generate vanished in the 
laughter. Antiquated rituals seemed 
irrelevant, somehow. With relief we 
went back to our out-of-body exper- 
iments. 

The coven’s activities seemed 
harmless enough, except for the fact 
that I kept having dreams. Over and 
over it was the same dream, with 
minor variations. Our newly elected 
president, looking handsome,

healthy and altogether heroic in 
jodphurs, riding boots and a white 
shirt with most of the buttons tom 
off, is tied to a stake in a night-time 
forest. Around him dance baleful, 
shrieking hags, adding more logs to 
the pile at his feet. Something is 
coming up behind me, a tower of 
fire radiating absolute evil, I guess. 
I don’t dare turn around to look. 

Somehow I am handed a burning 
brand. The Devil has picked 
me — me, of all people! — to light 
the fire that will destroy the arch 
enemy of all that is evil, the Presi- 
dent of the United States. I do my 
best, but the wood — mossy, dew- 
wet logs from the forest floor — will 
not catch; no Girl Scout, I need a 
gas jet, or at least a can of lighter 
fluid, to start a fire. Finally an im- 
patient witch snatches the brand and 
pushes me away, out of the circle 
of dancing witches. I am not 
wicked enough, it seems; so I am 
rejected, and I wake up. 

However innocent, harmless, and 
even ineffectual, the coven may ap- 
pear to be, it is still a witches’ 
coven and it ties me to the forces of 
evil, so the dream seemed to be tell- 
ing me. Yet how could I give up 
the best friends I had ever known? 
Or the feeling that a presidential 
candidate who ignores a tired, un- 
tidy teen-ager — who drove all day 
to see him — and shakes hands only 
with prosperous-looking men in 
business suits, does not deserve to 
occupy the White House? If only 
my coven would teach me some 
spells so I could put a hex on him! 
Maybe some painful, chronic dis- 
ease. 

“When are we going to get into 
spells?’’ I asked Don Manson soon 



after I joined the coven. 

“You can get into spells 
whenever you want to, Nell. It’s a 
free country,’’ Don replied rather 
impatiently. 

“Nell’s new here. Maybe she 
doesn’t know our system,” Fred 
Birch said, coming up between us 
and putting a friendly arm around 
each of us. 

“What system. Uncle Fred?” I 
asked, extracting his hand from my 
jeans pocket and holding it firmly. 

“The problem is, none of us 
knows any reliable spells. Oh, there 
are spells given in the classics on 
witchcraft, which generally suffer 
from incomplete directions or call 
for European herbs, plants no one 
here would recognize if they did 
happen to sprout on campus. Or 
they recommend procedures imprac- 
tical for modem apartment dwellers, 
such as stuffing a sheep’s heart up 
one’s chimney. Be that as it may. 
Whenever one of us tries a spell, he 
reports everything he does and the 
outcome, whether or not he got any 
result at all, not necessarily the de- 
sired one, in the coven Grimoire, or 
spellbook.” Uncle Fred looked 
around. “Where the hell is the 
Grimoire? It’s supposed to be 
brought to all the meetings.” 

Where was the Grimoire, ev- 
eryone wondered. After five or six 
minutes of group mutterings, Harry 
Box, the meteorologist, thought he 
might have left it in the trunk of his 
car, and went out to look. Sure 
enough, the Grimoire had been in 
Box’s trunk since last summer. No 
one had missed it. The Grimoire 
turned out to be one of those books 
of blank pages bound in gold- 
stamped artificial leather that you 



THE DEVIL AND ALL HER WORKS 



49 




can buy in most bookstores. All of 
the pages were still blank. 

“Witches, this won’t do!” said 
Uncle Fred. “We’re supposed to be 
expanding the frontiers of occult 
knowledge in all sorts of forbidden 
directions, yet none of you has re- 
ported a spell, successful or other- 
wise. What do you want to do, turn 
into yogis by default? Hasn’t any- 
one tried a spell?” 

After a silence Box confessed, “I 
tried a Navaho rain chant last sum- 
mer, during the drought.” 

“Oh, that’s what brought on the 
thunderstorm!” someone joked. 

“The thunderstorm was two days 
later. Lightning set brush fires all 
over the county. It was dramatic 
enough that way, but the rain was, 
maybe, one drop per square cen- 
timeter. Officially it was not enough 
to measure. I was going to write it 
up anyway — that’s why I took the 
Grimoire home — but then . well, 
nobody else had written up any- 
thing, and ... 1 mean, if there 
hadn’t been any rain at all, or if 
there had been some measurable 
amount, but how can you write up a 
report when there is some rain, but 
not enough to measure?” Box won- 
dered. 

“Especially when you have to 
despoil a virgin blank book to do 
it,” said Harriet Who. (By chang- 
ing her last name to Who, Harriet 
renounced both her ex-husband’s 
and her father’s last names and as- 
sumed “the identity crisis of mod- 
em woman,” as she explained it.) 

“This virgin cost the cov- 
en. .um, two dollars and 
ninety-eight cents,” said Uncle 
Fred, looking at the flyleaf. “De- 
spoil her, Harry. That is, if you still 

50 



have your notes. And who knows? 
If enough of you follow suit, I may 
be tempted to reveal my experi- 
ments with rhinocerous horn.” 

The Grimoire was soon filled and 
a second purchased. Many reports 
were positive in that the desired 
outcome had occurred — most likely 
by coincidence, the authors invari- 
ably observed. The spells were all 
kindly in intent, though. The most 
malignant was a curse on tomato 
horn worms. Not one would do for 
giving the President a painful, 
chronic disease. 

So I carved a statue of the Presi- 
dent out of an old Christmas candle 
and stuck pins in it for a while one 
night. The next morning I read in 
Time that he already had a chronic 
and a painful disease. One of 
each. He had had them for years. 
So much for black magic. No, I 
didn’t write that one up for the coven 
Grimoire ! 

Hexing did not seem to work for 
me, but I got pretty good at the 
out-of-body stuff, good enough to 
appear to fourteen firemen pinned 
down by crossfire during the race 
riots of the following summer and 
lead them to safety through back al- 
leys and abandoned buildings I had 
previously scouted out. TTiis was 
not a particularly brave thing to do. 
Being disembodied, I was never in 
any danger myself. Still, I think it 
was a nice thing to do, to save four- 
teen firemen from “meeting their 
Maker,” as the saying goes. Witch- 
craft can’t be all bad, can it, if you 
can use the skills you learn in your 
coven to save human lives? 

Later Uncle Fred picked me to 
help out the coven, but I don’t 
know whether he did so because I 

GALAXY 





was so good at the out-of-body bit 
or because I already knew Charlie 
Crane. 

Absolutely the best-looking man I 
have ever met in my whole life, he 
came out of the library with me at 
closing time, introduced himself, 
mentioned chemical engineering, 
and insisted on walking me back to 
the dorm. It was a dark night lit by 
flashes of lightning, with a hint of 
storm on the gusty wind. At every 
gust and flash he put his arm 
around me in case I might be 
frightened; and every time he put 
his arm around me, 1 laughed and 
pushed him away. 

That’s how I found out he was 
wearing a shoulder holster under his 
jacket. 

Between passes Charlie enter- 
tained me with stories about all the 
girls who had been raped and/or 



murdered on campus in the last ten 
years. Moral: I was lucky to have 
his protection. 

Well, the campus is in the old 
part of town, surrounded on three 
sides by the decaying neighbor- 
hoods that had erupted into violence 
the previous summer. We do have 
more than our share of crime: 
maybe thirty sex-crime victims in 
the last ten years out of a total stu- 
dent population of fifteen thousand 
a year. I was about as likely to be 
raped and murdered on the average 
walk as I was to be struck by that 
distant lightning. Chalk up one ben- 
efit of hanging around with scien- 
tists: I now go by probabilities. 

The time to worry, mother al- 
ways told me, is when the lightning 
and thunder come close together. 
That seemed the case with Charlie. 
The gun under his coat, the obses- 



THE DEVIL AND ALL HER WORKS

sion with rape and murder. 

The funny thing is, all he would 
have had to say was “please.” 
Now, I may be the black sheep of 
the family, but I’m not promiscu- 
ous. I never sleep with a guy on the 
first date. I don’t feel like it with 
someone I hardly know. For Charlie 
I would have made an exception, he 
was that good-looking. 

Only I’m not about to be pushed 
around by anyone, no matter how 
good-looking. And it seemed as 
though Charlie wouldn’t say 
“please” — he’d say, “You have to. 
I have a gun.” So when what he 
really said was, “I’m taking you 
out tomorrow night. Where do you 
want to go?” I said I had to write a 
term paper. That left “Friday 
night?” and “Any time Saturday or 
Sunday?” 

Running out of excuses, I said 
there was another man in my life, 
which I guess was true. 

The President. 

Whenever I went out with any- 
one, I kept thinking that I was wast- 
ing my time by having fun when I 
ought to be getting even with him. 

So anyway, was I surprised when 
Charlie showed up at the next esbat 
with Harriet Who! I mean, Charlie 
is the best-looking man in the uni- 
verse, now that Che Guevarra is 
dead. And Harriet is a short, 
dumpy, middle-aged woman with 
one topic of conversation: how the 
male-dominated world is unfair to 
women. If you talk about music, 
she’ll demand to know why there 
aren’t more female composers and 
conductors. And I agree with her. 
Whole-heartedly. I just couldn’t un- 
derstand why Harriet would appeal 
to Charlie Crane. 



And vice versa. Obviously Har- 
riet was really gone on Charlie. 

“But I mean, he’s obsessed with 
it,” I explained to Uncle Fred after 
the meeting. “He knows the names, 
the dates, how the victim was 
dressed, everything. 

“If he’s that interested in crime, 
it might be because he’s in law en- 
forcement,” Uncle Fred suggested. 

“Charlie? He’s a grad student in 
chemical engineering,” I said, even 
as the light dawned. Grad students 
do not wear shoulder holsters. 

“Follow him, Nell. I’ll watch 
your body.” One of Uncle Fred’s 
rules for the coven was that no one 
could undertake an out-of-body ex- 
perience without what he called a 
“baby-sitter” watching the body. 

“You’re the last person I’d want 
watching my body,” I joked in all 
seriousness. 

“Dear Nell. Sweet Nell. Adora- 
ble Nell. Haven’t you learned yet 
that barking dogs don’t bite? Your 
virginity, or what’s left of it, is safe 
with me, alas. Now be off with 
you.” 

Wondering why I would be will- 
ing to sleep with Charlie just be- 
cause he was good-looking and not 
with Uncle Fred, whom I knew and 
loved, I slipped my mortal, fleshy 
and admittedly rather attractive 
body to hover, most of the night, 
over Harriet’s apartment house. Fi- 
nally Charlie emerged and went to a 
telephone booth in a gas station on 
the comer. And that’s when I 
learned. 

It was the F. B. I., no less, that 
was trying to infiltrate our collegiate 
coven. 

So much for my undergraduate 
rape fantasies.

GALAXY 




Uncle Fred and I decided not to 
tell the others. Instead, we let Char- 
lie come to all the meetings he 
liked. After falling asleep twice in a 
row, Charlie tried to stir up some 
excitement, and we had to tell him 
that, while we agreed that Africa 
was as advanced in magic as any 
continent, we couldn’t see how get- 
ting in touch with the local chapter 
of the Black Panthers would further 
our aims, or theirs. 

Finally, during one interminable 
ESP experiment, Charlie whispered 
to me, “You don’t really believe in 
this, do you?” and I was bored 
enough to whisper back, “No, 
I’m — shhhhV’ and then, right in his 
ear, “I’m a secret agent for the 
F.B.I.” Charlie gave me a long 
look. I gave him my sweetest smile. 

And we never saw Charlie again. 

With the help of Harriet, who 
had just had her opinion of men 
confirmed, we put the pieces to- 
gether. Judging by the sweet 
nothings Charlie had whispered in 
her ear, the F.B.I. was not inves- 
tigating the Devil and all of his 
works. 

It was interested only in the race 
riot of the preceding summer. Infla- 
tion, unemployment and racial dis- 
crimination were not adequate 
reasons for rioting to the 
government’s way of thinking. 
There had to be a secret conspiracy 
of Communists behind it all. The 
plotting must be centered in the col- 
lege surrounded on three sides by 
ghetto, right? I mean, you wouldn’t 
expect mere negroes to take to 
Communism all by themselves! 

We had to hand it to Charlie, 
though. It’s not every man who is 
able to whisper, “But don’t you 



people know any of the black ac- 
tivists in the city?” when he’s in 
like Flynn. 

Suddenly it was the spring of my 
senior year, and a lot of students 
were cutting classes, demonstrating, 
holding group camp-outs in the 
Administration Building and setting 
fire to library wastebaskets to pro- 
test the war in Nambia. Then Marie 
Murphy was killed by a tear-gas 
shell, and the whole student body 
went crazy. 

Except me. 

Not that I didn’t understand how 
they felt. If I were a man, I 
wouldn’t want to have to fight, and 
maybe die, for some fat old 
monarch who walks to his throne on 
the necks of his crouching subjects 
just because the rebels call them- 
selves Socialists! 

And if defoliating the jungle re- 
ally does destroy the last known 
habitat of the persimmon tree frog, 
then the Air Force should not do it. 
What I didn’t understand was how 
closing the college would bring 
Marie back, or help end the war. 
And the food-processing firm I 
work for had promised me a job 
with their branch in Thailand just as 
soon as I got my B.A. It was be- 
ginning to look like I would never 
graduate. 

On May first the soldiers came. 
No, it wasn’t the National Guard. 
They went to other colleges, not 
ours. We got troops from the army 
base at Pierson’s Point. They 
marched around the campus in long 
columns, two abreast, double-time, 
with fixed bayonets; or they stood 
around in the rain in groups of two 
or three, looking bored and an- 
noyed. After a couple of days of

“A green tree python?” Uncle 
Fred guessed. 

“Not a constrictor, surely. A 
viper. I rather fancy the Gabon 
viper, myself,” said Box, who 
raised snakes as a hobby. 

“Look. The serpent talked to 
Eve. And snakes can’t talk,” I said, 
feeling very clever. But they didn’t 
let me feel clever for long. 

“Snakes in the Garden of Eden 
could talk in the same way that drag- 
ons can breathe fire. Fairy-tale 
animals can do anything the author 
likes,” said Uncle Fred. 

“That’s not a fairy tale, it’s the 
Bible!” 

“Nell, I happen to believe in 
evolution. If you don’t. I’ll respect 
your beliefs, but I’m not going to 
argue with you,” Uncle Fred said 
gently. 

“I believe in evolution too, of 
course, but — ” 

“Then what the hell are we talk- 
ing about?” said Uncle Fred. 

It was hard to tell at that point. 
“The Devil?” I guessed, as I be- 
came aware of a gap a mile wide 
between my home-town Sunday 
school and my college education. 
On the far side stood Jesus, gentle, 
mild, welcoming the little children. 
I was on the opposite shore with the 
trilobites, dinosaurs, woolly mam- 
moths and “Chuck baby,” as my 
Biology 100 teacher had called the 
great Darwin. Was there no bridge 
back to Jesus? 

Not for a witch in a coven, there 
wasn’t. 

I had made my choice. Not that 
I!d ever had anything to lose. After 
all, I was the black sheep of the 
family to begin with. I think I’d 
rather go to Hell, anyway. All the 



most interesting people will be 
there. 

“All right, let’s talk about the 
Devil,” said Uncle Fred. “The first 
thing you need to know about the 
Devil is that there’s no such thing. 
Now. What else would you like to 
know?” 

“Uh ... but there’s this myth of 
the Devil. You know, the fellow 
with horns and cloven hooves — ” 

“And oversized genitals?” Uncle 
Fred suggested. 

“That may be the projection of 
your unconscious!” I retorted. 

“That’s Pan,” Don had said at 
the same time. “Seriously, Nell,” 
he went on when the laughter died 
down, “the homed diety, half man, 
half animal, was originally the clas- 
sic nature god. Pan. When Chris- 
tianity began its conquest of the 
European mind, it had to do some- 
thing with all the local gods. Many 
became saints in the Catholic pan- 
theon. Others, like Pan, Just didn’t fit 
and were said to be devils or evil 
spirits. Dealing with them would 
condemn your immortal soul to 
everlasting torture, the early Chris- 
tians said. That was undoubtedly the 
worst threat they could think of. 
Join the Christian Church or rot in 
Hell forever! Good propaganda, I 
suppose. Anyway, it worked. That 
doesn’t mean we have to believe it. 
And, 1 mean, really! What sort of 
god would damn anyone, anyone in 
the world, to everlasting torment? 
He would have to be worse than the 
demons who actually did the tor- 
ture, wouldn’t he? If God were re- 
ally like that, I don’t think I’d want 
to cooperate.” 

“And when you think about what 
Pan really represents,” said Uncle 



THE DEVIL AND ALL HER WORKS

Fred. “Half man, half animal — the 
perfect symbol for the fusion of 
human nature with the animal in- 
stincts. No wonder the Christian 
Church wanted to repress — ’’ 

“I don’t know why you keep 
talking about Pan when Satan really 
was Aradia,” Harriet interrupted. 
“Look at the facts! In the Middle 
Ages nine out of ten convicted 
witches were women. And whom 
did they worship? Aradia! Come fly 
through the air, on your broomstick 
if you must, without it if you can. 
On, through the air! To the planets! 
To the galaxies! And who will help 
you get there? Aradia, the Great. 
The power of nature expressed as 
female. The god (I don’t accept 
goddess, it’s a diminutive) of half 
the world, the world of woman! 

“But the Christian Church 
couldn’t let women identify with 
any kind of power. Oh, no, we 
weren’t allowed an aspect of the di- 
vine that we could relate to, oh, no! 
The church fathers were afraid of 
us, you see. They made it so that 
the only relationship we could have 
with the divine was a sexual one. 
We could relate to the church as the 
Bride of Christ, or to Mary as the 
Mother of God, but we could not be 
Christ, we could not be God. Direct 
identification with the divine was 
reserved for males.” 

“I can’t buy that, Harriet. I can’t 
believe the church fathers really in- 
tended to suppress women when 
they ignored the feminine aspects of 
the divine,” Don said. “Isn’t it 
more likely that they were children 
of their time — ” 

Harriet interrupted him with, 
“Oh, yeah? Then I suppose you 
can’t believe that George 

56 



Washington and his crew really in- 
tended to suppress women when 
they denied them the right to vote, 
either?” 

We had invoked Aradia several 
times during our traditional witch- 
craft exercises, but no one had ex- 
plained to me who she was and I 
hadn’t thought to ask. Now I won- 
dered whether it was Aradia I had 
seen in my dream. 

“If the Devil doesn’t exist, what 
about Aradia?” I asked Henry 
Frankenheimer, who happened to be 
standing within whispering distance. 

“Depends on what you mean by 
‘exist,’ ” Henry said carefully, and 
added the only fact he was sure of: 
“Neither one came when we 
called.” 

“I ask for bread and you give me 
a stone!” I shouted, which shows 
how upset I was. Normally I avoid 
such cliches. 

“What did I doV Henry asked, 
looking bewildered. 

“If you don’t want any more 
stones, Nell, why don’t you tell us 
what’s really bothering you? I can’t 
believe it’s metaphysics,” said 
Uncle Fred, coming close but for 
once not putting his arm around me. 
He looked as though he were really 
concerned. 

What could I say? Could I tell 
them: I had this dream, see, and in 
it some dark power, Satan or 
Aradia, gave me the responsibility 
for doing in the President of the 
United States? Now I want to know 
if I really ought to? No, I couldn’t 
say that. What I actually said was, 
“I’ve been with the coven for al- 
most four years, and really, I love 
you all. I’ve loved every minute of 
it. Only now that I’m about to 

GALAXY 




graduate, I’d like to know before I 
go away if dabbling in witchcraft 
has imperiled my immortal soul. 
And don’t you dare ask me to oper- 
ationally define ‘soul’ or I’ll make a 
waxen image of you and stick pins 
in it!” 

Looking Uncle Fred in both eyes, 
I waited the necessary moment and 
then added, ”... and guess where 
I’m going to stick the pins!” 

“Umm, yes. We’ll miss you, 
Nell. The coven won’t be the same 
without you. In fact,” said Uncle 
Fred, “there’s a plot afoot, to 
which I am not a party, to talk you 
into graduate school. But you never 
were a student. You need to be out 
in the world, doing things. Our loss 
is the world’s gain. So much for 
that. 

“To answer your legitimate, ur- 
gent and vital question. There is 
some scientific evidence to support 
a belief in life after death, namely, 
the recollections of medical patients 
who were revived after all vital 
signs ceased. Some seventeen per 
cent of them remember extremely 
pleasant out-of-body experiences; 
the rest remember nothing, not un- 
expectedly; they were unconscious 
at the time. Do the memories of the 
few who remember something prove 
life after death. Heaven even, or 
only the powers of the human im- 
agination? Perhaps they prove 
whichever hypothesis you want to 
believe. At any rate, there is no sci- 
entific evidence at all to support a 
belief in Hell. None at all. The 
most parsimonious explanation is 
that Hell is a myth invented by the 
church to scare the peasants into 
behaving themselves. 

“The coven did spend the first 



year of its existence discussing first 
causes. Maybe we should have writ- 
ten up the Minutes and let you see 
them. About all we could agree on 
was that in view of the Second Law 
of Thermodynamics, there had to be 
another Force, a creative organizing 
Force, opposing the universal decay 
of energy in order to explain the 
universe. To avoid mental images 
of white-bearded old men sitting on 
clouds, we decided to call our crea- 
tive force ‘Anti-entropy.’ God, if 
you like, is Anti-entropy. Among 
other things, no doubt. 

“Now, what else would you like 
to know? What else would you like 
to know that an eighty-year-old 
physiological psychologist can tell 
you? One with many awards and 
publications behind him. Along 
with almost all of his life. And 
when St. Peter calls me up, if that 
old myth is true, which I doubt, and 
says, ‘Who are you, that you think 
you can enter the Gates of Heaven?’ 
shall I say, ‘I’m the Fred Birch?’ 
Or shall I say, rather, ‘Hell, I’m 
just a dirty old man,’ and will the 
gates of Heaven then open wide? 

“Actually, what I’m really an- 
gling for is to be reincarnated as a 
dolphin. The dolphins would under- 
stand me as the Americans never 
have. So, my dear Nell, if there is 
anything you want to know that an 
eighty-year-old physiological psy- 
chologist who has known sin can 
tell you, be sure to ask. Except that 
I don’t think there is. I think that 
what you really want to know is 
similar to what I gave up worrying 
about sixty years ago. The questions 
are . horribly important, there’s 
no doubt about that. But scientifi- 
cally they’re meaningless. There’s

no way to find the answers. Isn’t 
that so?” 

‘‘Uh ... I don’t know. .” 

“Of course you don’t. The dif- 
ference between what is known, 
what can be known and what can 
never be known is not taught at the 
undergraduate level,” Uncle Fred 
said wittily. It seemed as though 
everyone laughed but me. 

I decided to go ahead and murder 
the President, and to Hell with them 
all! 

★ ★ ★ 

At some point in my college 
career I had spent the better part of 
a night being driven through the 
countryside by a junior I hardly 
knew while his roommate told a girl 
I hardly knew why Croatia should 
be free. The backseat Croatian was 
Bela Benjac. 

Bela Benjac began receiving vis- 
its from a numinous figure dressed 
in shimmering white, with a sugges- 
tion of wings behind the bared 
shoulders and long chestnut hair 
emitting a faint, halo-like glow. 
Your disembodied self does not 
have to resemble the body you left 
behind. You can appear as anything 
you choose. So naturally I chose to 
look like Satan. Wouldn’t you if 
you were a girl? 

The first time I showed up, Bela 
buried his head under the covers 
and muttered, “What did I do this 
time?” It turned out that I was not 
his first incorporeal visitor. I was 
only the first to be kind to him. 
Most of his hallucinations were 
nameless horrors that ripped up his 
spirit with bloody talons and, 
frankly, I don’t see how the poor 

58 



boy could stand it. He really needed 
psychiatric help. 

If he did as I said, he would get 
all the help he needed. I was only 
doing him a favor when I told him 
that the vice-president’s adored 
mother was a Croatian, and if the 
President weren’t standing in the 
way. 

Soon I discovered that I did not 
have to be disembodied to look like 
Satan. If I composed myself before 
entering a room and thought the 
right thoughts, why, then when I 
went in, all the broad-shouldered 
braggarts who carve notches on 
their steering wheels would soon be 
slobbering all over me, while the 
guys I really like to talk to — the 
ones who have something interest- 
ing to say if only you can draw 
them out — would be off in comers 
saying it to the intelligent-looking 
girls. Being stunningly beautiful is 
all right on occasion, I guess. Most 
of the time I’m better off being my- 
self. 

Meanwhile, back at the White 
House our President was beginning 
to run for reelection. 

I don’t know what he was trying 
to accomplish when he decided to 
speak at all the towns and , colleges 
that had erupted into riots and vio- 
lence during the previous four 
years. Was he trying to prove he 
was brave? Nobody had ever ac- 
cused him of cowardice. Maybe he 
just wanted to show that he was in- 
defatigable. 

When he spoke at the Hilton 
Hotel downtown, I went early to be 
sure of getting a seat. I wanted to 
size him up one more time and 
make certain I knew what I was 
doing before I started worrying 

GALAXY 




about all the little details you can’t 
leam from witchcraft manuals, like 
how you go about buying an un- 
traceable gun. 

So anyway, I went down at four, 
looking better than usual (if I do 
say so myselO in a new purple- 
velveteen trenchcoat I had bought 
for the trip to Thailand. I left my 
hat and handbag (minus wallet) in a 
second-row seat and came back 
after dinner to find Don Manson, of 
all people, in the seat next to mine. 

“Well, hello!” I said in my 
friendliest voice. 

Don took one look at me, gulped 
slightly and started talking about 
how sorry he was that his adored 
wife couldn’t be with him. It 
seemed that she was at home with 
the kids. All six of them. Now, if 
Don was married, odd that he never 
mentioned it during any of the times 
we had been out together. Some- 
thing was funny. Then I realized 
what it was. I had put on my Satan 
guise without meaning to and Don 
had not recognized me. I would 
have to kid him about that later. 

In the meantime, I nuzzled up 
against him. Don, in panic, nuzzled 
up to the fat man on his other side. 
On the dais. Senator O’Keefe spent 
twenty-five minutes elaborating on 
the virtues of the man we were 
about to hear, finally concluding: 
“Ladies and gentlemen, the Presi- 
dent of the United States!” 

He seemed older than when I had 
seen him last, but then so was I. A 
lot older. 

“These are the times that try 
men’s souls,” he would have said 
had it not already been said before. 
As it was, he had to settle for a 
second-best sentiment. I forget what 



it was, I was too busy thinking my 
own thoughts: “These may be 

perilous times, but didn’t you get us 
into them? Our souls wouldn’t be 
tried if you hadn’t blundered. Just 
how much do you expect us to suf- 
fer for your mistakes?” 

His speaking technique had im- 
proved in the last four years. Now 
he glanced at his notes only every 
few sentences and spent the rest of 
the time looking out at the audience. 
Often he seemed to be looking at 
me. That was probably an illusion 
but I smiled anyway whenever I 
thought I had caught his eye. 

Then, the speech over, the party 
faithful shouted, stamped their feet 
and whirled noise-makers. The Pres- 
ident consulted for a few minutes 
with some men and after that he 
began to walk along between the 
rows of chairs, shaking hands as he 
went with all the people reaching 
out toward him. 

“Here goes nothing,” I thought, 
pushing my arm out between the 
crowd in the front row. 

Suddenly he was standing there, 
pressing my hand in both of his, 
and I was totally overwhelmed by 
the presidential presence. 

How could a man with such 
clear, honest, frank blue eyes have 
ordered the assassination of the 
President of Nicaragua? Impossible! 
It was all lies. And if he had led us 
a bit too close for comfort to the 
brink of World War III, the Rus- 
sians had backed down at the last 
minute all three times, so maybe he 
hadn’t miscalculated after all. Of 
one thing I was sure. He was a real 
nice guy and he was doing the best 
job he could. 

A dark shape, like a pterodactyl, 

59 



THE DEVIL AND ALL HER WORKS 




that had lived within me for the last 
four years departed then and fled 
cawing back over the abyss to the 
far side, the side of the trilobites, 
dinosaurs and college professors. 

On another far side I saw Jesus, 
meek and mild, trying to talk to my 
mother, who wouldn’t have any- 
thing to do with Him because He 
looked like a hippy; Poor old Mom. 
How sad to spend one’s whole life 
in the straitjacket of a narrow 
mind! And where was I, on this 
mental Grand Canyon rim? I 
thought you knew. I was on the 
third side. The side of the real 
world. The side the President of the 
United States was on. 

There was a quick, hollow noise, 
audible even over the roar of the 
crowd. There was also, I then re- 
alized, a folded piece of paper in 
my hand. Straightening it out, I 
read, “Go to the west elevator bank 
at ten tonight and take a car to the 
tenth floor. ‘Sam’ will meet you 
there and bring you the rest of the 
way.’’ No signature. Of course not. 
After all, the guy was married. 

So. Uncle Sam wants me. And I 
left my diaphragm back at the 
dorm, I remember thinking. In the 
distance men were shouting. Some- 
one screamed. All about me people 
were asking, “What is it? What’s 
happened?’’ It was pandemonium. 

I looked around but all I could 
see were the belts of people who 
were standing on chairs for a better 
look. Then Napoleon was coming 
toward me, one hand in the front of 
his raincoat. Of course it wasn’t re- 
ally Napoleon; it was Bela Benjac. 
Funny I had never noticed the re- 
semblance before. Bela saw me, 
stopped and stared. It must have 

60 



been a real shock to him, seeing the 
mystic vision of his dreams there in 
flesh, blood and a purple-velveteen 
trenchcoat. 

Slowly Bela’s hand emerged from 
his slicker. The gun he held was 
still smoking. He looked like he 
might start shooting everyone in 
sight. Beginning with me. 

I held out my hand and said, 
“Bela, give me the gun.’’ 

Bela looked at the weapon then 
as though wondering what it was 
doing in his hand. He peered down 
the barrel. Was it a real gun? Ex- 
perimentally, he pulled the trigger. 
Just then two men grabbed him 
from behind but I’m certain Bela 
fired first. Not that he meant to 
commit suicide. He didn’t know 
what he was doing. Not ever. 

Not any more than I had known. 
How could I have been so silly and 
childish that I wanted to kill a man 
over a trivial slight? And now the 
President was being carried into an 
ambulance that had driven right into 
the room. He must be really hurt. 
Suddenly I had to talk to someone. 

My Satanic beauty felt as though 
it were turned off but I checked my 
compact to make sure. Then I 
looked around for Don. He was 
talking to several beefy-looking 
men. I came up behind him just in 
time to hear him say, “I’m sure the 
girl sitting next to me was his ac- 
complice. She went out of her way 
to delay the President — you know 
how he is about women — and then 
when the assassin nearly got away 
in the crowd, she called him by 
name and said, ‘Give me your gun.’ 
She was going to hide it for him, 
you see. Gorgeous redhead, you 
can’t miss her.” 



GALAXY 




One of the beefy men was look- 
ing over Don’s shoulder at me. I 
could just hear him thinking, pretty, 
yes. But gorgeous? “What was she 
wearing?” the man asked. 

“A brown coat, suede or a 
suede-like material. Yes, I’m pretty 
sure it was suede. Look for a 
gorgeous redhead in a brown suede 
coat. .” 

The beefy man was no longer 
looking at me. I eased my way back 
through the crowd as fast as I could 
without making myself conspicuous 
and took off my purple-velveteen 
trenchcoat, saying, “Hot in here, 
isn’t it?” to the people around me. 

No one replied. 

As I listened to everyone talk 
about this terrible, tragic act and 
imagine all sorts of conspiracies be- 
hind it, with student rioters and 
Communists at the bottom, I re- 
alized that I would never be able to 
tell anyone what I knew. Not even 
my coven, not even Uncle Fred. 

If I asked what power, dark or 
otherwise, had welded a witch and 
a madman into a conspiracy to de- 
stroy a president who was leading 
his country into anarchy and war. 
Uncle Fred would say something 
silly, like “Anti-entropy.” 

And Don would turn me in. 

Two hours later Senator O’Keefe 
claimed the microphone. He was so 
choked up he could hardly speak 
but he managed to say, “Ladies and 
gentlemen. The President is dead.” 

“Nell! What are you doing 
here?” said Don in my ear. 

Absent-mindedly stroking the 
purple-velveteen trenchcoat folded 
over my arm with the lining turned 
out, I answered, “I only wish I 
knew.” ★

MAN AND THE WEATHER MACHINE 



ILL YOUR GRANDCHILDREN live 
in a new Ice Age? 

Not many years ago that would 
have been a silly question. There 
was considerable debate about what 
causes Ice Ages — those periods 
when the glaciers flow out of the 
north to cover a great part of the 
temperature zones, solid sheets of 
ice creeping over Canada and most 
of northern Europe, with fingers 
reaching down as far as St. Louis, 
Missouri; sea level down by tens to 
hundreds of feet, torrential rains in 
the southern US and Mexico, rush- 
ing rivers where now there is 
desert — but everyone agreed that 
however these periodic disasters 
were triggered, they did not come 
on fast. Our remote descendents 
might have to worry about the re- 
turn of the ice, but surely we did 
not. 

The worst case would do no more 
than bring back the “Little Ice 
Age” of the 1 5th and 16th Cen- 

62 



turies, which obliterated the Norse 
settlements on Greenland and made 
Iceland a place of poverty. More 
probable might be a return to the 
frigid conditions of the 18th Cen- 
tury, when cannon were transported 
on the ice in New York harbor, and 
thick ice formed on most of the 
streams in Northern Europe and the 
United States. Those we knew 
could happen, and relatively quick- 
ly; but not the great sheets of ice 
covering inhabitable lands; not the 
emergence of the land between Aus- 
tralia and New Zealand; not Britain 
under hundreds of feet of ice and 
snow. Those took place gradually. 

Well, now we know better. The 
last Ice Age, which peaked about 
18,000 years ago, came on with un- 
common swiftness. Within a 
hundred years — possibly in consid- 
erably less time than that — the 
snowblitz struck, and the world was 
changed. 

The Ice Ages could start next 

GALAXY 



summer, for all we know. 
Worse — we could be causing them. 

* * * 

A traditional concept in science 
fiction is planetary engineering: the 
terraforming of worlds, tailoring 
them to make them more hospitable 
to human colonization. It seems a 
pretty far-out idea, and that’s all to 
the good: the real world is fast 
catching up with science fiction, so 
that much of what used to be sci- 
ence fiction turns out lately to be 
only engineering fiction. 

Alas, the real world has caught 
up again. Terraforming is no longer 
something for far-out stories. It’s a 
matter of practical concern. 

1 don’t mean that in the sense of 
terraforming other planets — 
although, as a previous column 
(“The Big Rain’’, GALAXY, Sep- 
tember 1975) pointed out, we 
could, just possibly, begin the ter- 
raforming of Venus within our 
lifetimes. What I’m talking about is 
the terraforming of Terra. We’re 
doing that now, like it or not — and 
unlike the superscience heroes of 
our fiction, we don’t have the re- 
motest idea of what effect we’re 
having. 

We are doing things to Mother 
Earth. On that we can all agree. 
What we’re doing is unknown. It 
might be disastrous. It might be be- 
neficial. We may have saved our- 
selves from a coming Ice Age — and 
we may be well down the road to- 
ward triggering a new one. And no 
one knows. 

Example: in the January 1978 
Scientific American there’s an excel- 
lent paper on carbon dioxide. As 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



Dr. George Woodwell, (Director of 
Ecological Systems Studies at 
Woods Hole) points out, “human 
activities are clearly increasing the 
carbon dioxide content of the 
Earth’s atmosphere.’’ We are burn- 
ing coal and oil, which have stored 
carbon for millions of years, and re- 
leasing the resulting CO 2 . We are 
also cutting back forests, which are 
Nature’s primary way of taking car- 
bon from the atmosphere and stor- 
ing it up, eliminating it from the 
meteorological cycle. 

Woodwell asks whether enough 
carbon can be taken from the at- 
mosphere to be stored in forests and 
oceans; enough, that is, to avert a 
major change in climate. 

The problem is, no one knows. 
There are very reputable 
climatologists who are convinced 
that fossil-fuel burning can’t possi- 
bly have a real effect on climate. 
The argument runs thus: if we go 
on using fossil fuels at present rates 
of growth, then by the year 2020 or 
so the effect of all the extra CO 2 
won’t be very large, no more than a 
degree centigrade or so at most, 
The slight rise in temperature will 
bring about increased evaporation 
from the oceans, thus increasing 
cloud cover; the clouds will reflect 
back sunlight that would have been 
absorbed, causing a cooling trend; 
this will reduce the Earth’s tempera- 
ture. There is, therefore, a negative 
feedback effect here, damping out 
the results of the increased CO 2 . 

Of course if things went on a 
very long time the cloud cover 
might not be able to compensate — 
but by the year 2020 or so we will 
have run out of much of our fossil 
fuel, so the process will inevitably 

63 




stop itself before any major damage 
has taken place. 

However, Woodwell’s article 
gives us something else to worry 
about: deforestation. It turns out 
that the major part of the CO 2 cycle 
is carried on through forest belts 
(not the oceans as we were not long 
ago told)* and the forests, particu- 
larly the tropical rainforests, are 
being cut back and destroyed at an 
ever-increasing rate. 

Furthermore, Woodwell says, 
forest management techniques do 
not compensate. In the first place, 
the rain forests are difficult if not 
impossible to replace; the land un- 
derneath is quickly leached out by 
the driving rain, and the result is a 
near-sterile hardpack. Secondly, al- 
though modern agriculture and 
forest management do in fact in- 
crease the yields of land over what 
would have grown in “natural” 
conditions, this is not the same as 
increased carbon storage; agricul- 
tural and managed-forest products 
are cycled very quickly. The paper 
produced from Canadian trees is 
oxidized within months to years, 
not stored as an ever-deeper pile of 
humus. 

Thus we certainly have an in- 
crease of CO 2 in the atmosphere, 
and the mechanisms for getting rid 
of it are being progressively elimi- 
nated. Should we do something 
about that? 

At this point the discussion gets 
tricky. There is a school of thought 
which says, with horror, “of course 
we must do something, and what 
we must do is stop it; and they way 
we must stop is to halt industrial 
growth. The Earth is fragile, and 
we dare not change it one whit. 

64 



Turn back, O man, forsake thy 
foolish ways, while yet there is 
time.” 

Despite its emotional appeal, this 
may not be the most intelligent ap- 
proach to the problem. Perhaps we 
should instead ask a few questions; 
surely it does no harm to take a few 
minutes off for thought. 

The first question is obvious; how 
much? It is the natural question of 
the scientist and engineer, although 
for some reason 1 don’t understand, 
rnost people who call themselves 
“ecologists” seldom think in quan- 
titative terms, and are generally 
bored by mathematics. (As an 
aside, when I studied ecology many 
years ago the professor sent ev- 
eryone off to take courses in differ- 
ential equations, on the theory that 
ecology deals with how one rate of 
change affects another, and the lan- 
guage with which one studies such 
changes is calculus; this seems to be 
a decidedly unpopular view among 
the ecologists who correspond with 
me.) 

The amount of CO 2 in the atmos- 
phere has risen steadily from the 
time we first began to measure it. 
At present there are about 333 parts 
per million (ppm), up from 315 in 
1958. This is a rise of just about 
one ppm per year, or, in percen- 
tages, about three tenths of a per- 
cent a year, which may not seem 
like much. However, this rate 
means a doubling time of 230 
years, and few doubt that doubling 
the CO 2 in the atmosphere will have 
a major effect on climate. 

Of course it probably won’t go 
that far; we don’t have enough fos- 
sil fuels; or do we? There is, as I 
reported in the last column, an 

GALAXY 




enormous reserve of frozen 
methane, and another of methane in 
geopressurized zones; the quantities 
approach the known coal reserves of 
the world, and neither frozen 
methane nor geopressure zones have 
been systematically prospected; 
there may be a very great deal. 
Methane is not carbon-rich, and 
produces when burned two atoms of 
water for each atom of CO2, but 
even so there is quite enough to 
pump out a lot of CO2 — and this in 
addition to the traditional fossil 
fuels such as coal and oil. 

(Another aside: if the frozen 

methane and geopressure zone gas- 
ses are developed quickly, the result 
will be that coal and oil become far 
too valuable merely to set a match 
to; thus even with rising energy use 
fueled exclusively on fossil fuels 
the net result would be a decrease 
in the CO2 production as the 
carbon-rich oil and coal are pre- 
served for other uses. However, 
let’s ignore that effect, since we 
don’t know when we’ll have practi- 
cal methane from our “exotic” 
sources.) 

Assume, then, that the trend con- 
tinues; CO2 levels rise. What will 
happen? 

The first thought is “hothouse”. 
Although conventional greenhouses 
including the one in my backyard 
don’t work this way, the 
“greenhouse effect” is simple 
enough. Heat comes in from the 
Sun. The radiant energy goes 
through the atmosphere and warms 
the ground. The ground in turn 
heats the air. However, much of the 
heat in the ground is re-radiated 
back into space, and an equilibrium 
temperature is established. 



CO2, though, is opaque to some 
of that re-radiated heat. Thus, in- 
stead of going back to space, the 
heat stays with us. The air is 
warmed, and a new and higher 
equilibrium temperature is estab- 
lished. If the temperature rises suf- 
ficiently to affect living systems — 
trees, plants, ocean plankton — then 
there is less CO2 removed by photo- 
synthesis. Whenever more CO2 is 
released — volcanoes, forest fires, 
blast furnaces, electric generators, 
automobiles, whatever — it tends to 
stay. Thus the CO2 level rises, ab- 
sorbing more heat, bringing about a 
new and higher equilibrium temper- 
ature. Eventually there is a runaway 
spiral that ends when the Earth 
looks like Venus: a dead cloud- 
wrapped ball with surface tempera- 
tures at or above the boiling point 
of water. 

That’s hardly a pleasant prospect, 
and surely something to bo avoided. 

However: you can make just as 
good a case for saying that in- 
creased levels of CO2 will trigger a 
new Ice Age. 

It works this way: CO2 brings 
about higher temperatures, but this 
causes more water to evaporate. 
Thus there is more rainfall. So far 
no difference from before. How- 
ever: much of that rainfall will 
come down in the Arctic as snow. 
With greater snowfall there’s higher 
reflectivity on the ground. All that 
white snow reflects back more sun- 
light. The Arctic regions get colder. 
More water vapor comes across, 
more falls as snow, and the snow 
continues to spread, chilling larger 
areas. The ice caps grow, glaciers 
form, and soon you have a runaway 
spiral that ends with much of the 



A STEP FARTHER OUT

Northern Hemisphere covered with 
ice. 

At this point the intelligent 
layman is entitled to a hefty objec- 
tion. We may all be willing to do 
what is needed to avert disaster — 
but what disaster? There’s a very 
great difference between Pasteurized 
plant a la Venus, and the coming of 
the Fimbulwinter and the return of 
the ice! Aren’t we entitled to know 
what doom we face? 

We may be entitled, but no one 
knows. There is no universally ac- 
cepted theory of what causes Ice 
Ages. 

To make it worse, there isn’t 
even a universal theory of what ef- 
fects man’s activities have on the 
climate. We may be warming the 
Earth. We may be cooling it. We 
may be keeping it constant. And 
while we’re at it, we don’t even 
know what Nature has in mind for 
us — after all, the Ice Ages came be- 
fore man was in the picture, and 
there are perfectly reputable 
theorists who believe that we’re due 
for another, and quickly. If they’re 
right, perhaps we had better burn 
more fossil fuels — and also get busy 
on planetary engineering on a vast 
scale. We don’t need Fimbulwinter. 

(Fimbulwinter is a Norse concept 
of doom; the winter that never ends. 
Mythologists used to believe it was 
a legend generated by observations 
of the cycle of days. People of the 
far north are very aware that in 
winter the days get shorter and shor- 
ter, and those very far north have 
noonday midnight, as well as mid- 
night Sun. Now, though, a few 
mythographers wonder if the old 
Norse legends of war between gods 
and frost giants do not come from 

66 



memories of the days when the ice 
was truly present.) 

Well — although we don’t know 
what causes Ice Ages, we do have 
theories. 

One of the first comes from that 
amazing man Benjamin Franklin, 
who observed that volcanic dust af- 
fected sunsets, and theorized that 
increases in dust levels could affect 
the reflectivity of Earth; this would 
lower temperatures, and might con- 
ceivably bring about Ice Ages 
through a positive feedback system. 
(He didn’t use the modern term 
“positive feedback’’, of course, but 
he did describe the progressive- 
spiral effect of increased snowfall 
making the ground brighter and thus 
reflecting even more sunlight, etc.) 

Franklin’s theory seemed to be 
confirmed in 1816. In 1815 a vol- 
cano named Tamboura blew off 
with about as much force as 
Krakatoa would fifty years later. 
There were brilliant sunsets through 
the year, and 1816 goes down in 
history as “the year without a 
summer’’; growing seasons were 
drastically shortened, there was 
heavy grey cloud over Europe all 
spring, and much increase in rain- 
fall. Incidentally, Tamboura may be 
thought of as the “father” of Fran- 
kenstein. As Nigel Calder says in 
The Weather Machine (excellent 
book), “it was the atrociously wet 
summer in Switzerland in 1816 that 
provoked Lord Byron to suggest 
that Mary Shelley should write a 
story. Her gloomy thoughts matched 
the weather.” 

The volcano theory has little sup- 
port nowaday. Ice Ages are a bit 
too regular to ascribe to something 
as random as that. Present view is 



GALAXY 




that volcanic dust can have a tem- 
porary effect, but is not a majoi 
cause of glaciation. 

Indeed, the modern view runs 
just the opposite; although a few 
theorists postulate that Ice Ages 
come from some kind of cooling 
event, most believe that what trig- 
gers the glaciers is an increase in 
temperature. Something has to 
transport all those billions of tons of 
water to the polar regions; that takes 
energy and lots of it, so how can 
subtracting energy from the weather 
system accomplish it? 

Of course, one of man’s effects is 
similar to volcanic activity: all that 
fossil fuel burned adds billions of 
tons of smoke particles to the at- 
mosphere, and few doubt that the 
effect of that is to increase reflectiv- 
ity (planetary reflectivity is called 
albedo by astronomers) of Earth, 
and thus to cool things down. 

Since the other effect of burning 
fossil fuels is to add CO 2 and thus 
warm things up, it can be — and by 
some with a right to an opinion 
is — argued that the net effect of 
man’s activity has been about nil; 
the particles cancel out the CO 2 . 

But don’t we know? Surely we 
can tell whether man’s activities are 
raising or lowering the Earth’s 
temperature! 

Nope. From 1880, when systema- 
tic observations began, to present, 
the variations in “average Earth temp- 
erature’’ have swung -from down 
about 0.2°C to up about 0.2°C. 
During the last century, when the 
“Little Ice Age’’ ended, things 
stayed reasonably constant; from 
1900 to 1950 there was a sharp rise, 
from -0.2 to -I- 0.2°C; since 1950 
there has been a fairly sharp down-

ward trend to the present condition. 

If one calculates the maximum 
effect of human activity — warming 
through CO 2 release, cooling from 
smoke particles in the air — neither 
is great enough to account for what 
has been observed. The Earth got 
hotter during this century than CO 2 
(ignoring smoke particles entirely) 
could have made it; at the turn of 
the century it was colder than 
smoke particles (ignoring CO 2 en- 
tirely) could have brought about. 

Man’s activities have an effect, 
but it clearly isn’t enough to pro- 
duce what Nature is doing to us; in 
fact, man’s activities are lost in the 
noise. 

And that’s assuming that the 
measurements are accurate. Con- 
sider the difficulty: what do we 
mean by an average temperature? 
Seasonal variations swing by 30° C

and more; and we are looking for 
trends measured in the tenths of a 
degree. Clearly we can have a very 
large effect simply by changing the 
way we calculate the “average.” 

Yet — small changes can be im- 
portant. 

We study temperatures of the past 
through a number of techniques: 
pollen residues found in ocean 
cores; tree rings; historical records; 
anything that will give a clue. From 
these emerges a picture of the cli- 
mate of the past. 

About 5,000 years ago there was 
a cool pjeriod, which was followed 
by a 2,200 year warming trend. 
That lasted until 1300 BC (a signi- 
ficant date, as we’ll see in a mo- 
ment) when temperatures fell again. 
They stayed low until 200 BC, and 
began to rise, until in 1000 AD 
there began a “warm snap” that 
carried the Norse to Iceland and 
Greenland. This lasted until 1400 
AD, peaking in 1200. Then began 
the “Little Ice Age” mentioned be- 
fore, which froze out the Greenland 
colonies, created the stories of ice 
skating on the canals of Holland, 
and brought about generally severe 
winters. In 1900 began the warming 
trend that took us to 1950. 

Some of those dates are signifi- 
cant. The so-called First Dark Age, 
the period in which writing was lost 
and European civilization fell from 
a high culture to a low level indeed, 
began in 1200 BC or so; Rhys Car- 
penter ascribes the fall of the 
Bronze Age to climate, and he has 
considerable evidence. 

We know of the effects of the 
“Little Ice Age”: lowered harvests, 
famines, generally bad conditions 
although its effects on cultural his- 



tory aren’t obvious. 

The point is that during that en- 
tire 5,000 year span, a time in 
which whole areas became inhabita- 
ble or uninhabitable, in which de- 
serts formed in what had been the 
breadbasket of the Roman 
Empire — in all that time, the total 
range of temperature differences 
was no more than 2° C. 

And we have in the last hundred 
years noted variations of ten percent 
of that. 

Little things can be important. 

Now to return to our speculation: 
what causes the variations in temp- 
erature? 

Sunspots? There’s certainly 
plenty of evidence that sunspots are 
significant. Indeed, there’s even a 
theory that the sunspot cycle can 
trigger earthquakes and volcanoes: 
the solar wind has a direct effect on 
the atmosphere, and this is large 
enough to cause a glitch in the 
Earth’s rotation rate; and that could 
certainly trigger off faults. (There is 
serious speculation that when the 
planets all line up they’ll cause 
sunspot activity which will trigger 
the San Andreas, and California 
will slide off into the sea. I don’t 
believe in it, but 1 am buying ear- 
thquake insurance. Can’t be too 
careful.) 

And after all, we understand 
sunspots. They come in regular 
waves, nice cycles — 

Or do they? It appears they do 
not. A search of historical records 
indicates long periods of solar 
quiescence, corresponding with long 
periods of drought and other clima- 
tic effects. After all, sunspots can 
be observed with a pinhole, and 
have been known since ancient 



68 



GALAXY 




times; and although we have trained 
ourselves to think of them as a reg- 
ular cyclic phenomenon, that turns 
out not always to have been true. 

Sigh. Will nothing hold still? 
Don’t we know anything? 

Well, we do know a few things. 
Oddly enough, we do have some 
theories on what man can do to 
Earth’s climate. 

For example, Soviet studies of 
polar ice are revealing: if all the 
Arctic ice melted, the effect would 
be to raise the northern temperatures 
by more than 40“ C, which is in- 
teresting, because that is to raise 
them above the level for the ice to 
form. The Earth, it seems, can live 
very well without her northern 
icecap. 

Of couse there would also be a 
dramatic rise in sea level, and that 
wouldn’t be very good for the in- 
habitants of New York and Los 
Angeles and other coastal cities. 

On the other end, we can calcu- 
late very well what would happen 
were the Earth covered entirely with 
ice and snow, and with the clouds 
all gone. The result would be very 
much lower temperatures (average 
about 100“ C less than present) and 
the ice would never melt. The 
Earth, it seems, could get along 
very well (although we would not) 
as a great snowball. 

However: both those extremes are 
not only unlikely, but unstable. 
Very small variations in the solar 
output would upset either — and the 
Sun is now known to be a variable 
star. 

That brings us to the point of this 
column. 

* * * 



I was recently asked to prepare a 
paper on mass hydraulic projects 
now on the drawing board. These 
include the NAWAPA (North 
American Water and Power Al- 
liance) proposal which would bring 
an annual 160 million acre-feet of 
water (and that is a lot of water), 
from Alaska and the Yukon down 
into the southern parts of Canada, 
the United States, and Mexico. 

Certainly the water is needed: 
civilization runs on water. There’s 
plenty of it in this world, but it is 
not conveniently located. As I write 
this, California is still under drought 
conditions while Oregon has floods. 
Since it takes, about 2,000 liters of 
water per citizen per day to run a 
modem industrial civilization; 4,500 
metric tons of water to produce a 
single ton of rice; 10,000 tons of 
water for each ton of cotton fibre 
harvested; it would be no bad thing 
if we could increase the water sup- 
ply. 

Ambitious as the NAWAPA pro- 
ject might seem, it’s small potatoes 
compared to Soviet plans. Already 
the Volga-Don Canal has affected 
the level of the Caspian Sea, but 
not enough: that largest fresh-water 
lake in the world is drying up. So, 
plan the Soviets, it could be filled 
again, by diverting north-flowing 
streams such as the Pechora from 
the Arctic regions down into the 
south-flowing river system. 

There’s even a Soviet plan to 
dam up the Yenesei and create a 
vast new inland sea in Siberia; this 
would have the effect of moderating 
Siberian winters. It might also af- 
fect the Arctic Sea enough to melt 
the icecap — one reason Soviet 
climatologists are interested in the 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



69 




effects of that rather drastic move. 

I was requested to examine the 
schemes for possible environmental 
effects. The engineering feasibilities 
are not in question; we can accom- 
plish NAWAPA, the Soviets are al- 
ready at work on the Pechora 
scheme, and the Yenesei plan is not 
beyond their capabilities. 

But because something can be 
done does not mean it should be 
done, and despite canards from 
“environmentalists” few engineers 
believe otherwise. 

But comes now the hitch; we just 
do not know what the effects of 
such vast projects would be. We 
can make guesses, we can do calcu- 
lations, we can speculate; we can 
perform studies; but in the last 
analysis our theory isn’t good 
enough. Not yet. 

So what should we do?. (Not that 
my opinion is all that important, 
except to me; but the question in- 
trigues me.) 

There are two possible answers. 
Understand; the economic benefits 
of NAWAPA to us, Canada, and 
Mexico are not much in doubt; nor 
are the benefits of the Soviet 
Pechora projects to refill the Cas- 
pian and flush out the Sea of Azov. 

Understand also; there are great 
positive “environmental” benefits 
to be reaped. The Caspian put back 
to its “natural” state; the Sea of 
Azov cleaned up; the Great Lakes 
flushed out. Lake Erie returned to 
what it was in the days of the 
American Revolution; these are all 
fall-out benefits that would certainly 
result. In addition, the dustbowl 
areas of the US and Soviet Union 
would receive enough water to 
bring back soil stability. Streams in 

70 



both the western and eastern US 
would run cleaner. 

In other words, there’s a lot 
going for the projects. 

But we don’t know what they 
will do. They might cause Ice 
Ages, or alternatively, heat things 
up (although that’s unlikely). 

It occurred to me that these water 
projects are not greatly different 
from energy policies. Burning fossil 
fuels has an effect on the climate, 
but we don’t know what it is. If we 
develop fusion, that will have an ef- 
fect. If we put up solar power satel- 
lites, they’ll have another effect. 
It’s a modern truism, a trite phrase 
that the ecologists use, that “every- 
thing affects everything else” but 
its triteness doesn’t make it less 
true. 

So; what shall we do? Take the 
approach that because we don’t 
know what effects we’ll have, we 
should no nothing; try to minimize 
man’s impact on the planet, even at 
the cost of eschewing the undoubted 
benefits from our hydraulic projects 
(or from developing new energy 
sources); or go ahead? 

At first blush — and it is probably 
due to the temper of the times that 
even I am affected this way — the 
choice seems clear. Best not med- 
dle. The forces unleashed are just 
too big for us. The possible disas- 
ters outweigh any possible benefits. 

But that’s at first look. There’s 
another way to see the question. 

It requires asking another ques- 
tion; what has Nature done? 

And the answer to that is 
“Plenty!” Over the past 5,(X)0 
years we’ve had pretty wild swings 
of climate — and those are trivial 
compared to others we know of. 

GALAXY 




Nature has taken this planet from 
near-universal tropic to the vast 
glaciers of the Ice Ages. That 
needn’t have concerned us back 
when we thought none of those ex- 
tremes came on quickly; but now 
we know better. 

If we do nothing at all we have 
not insured against a new snowblitz. 
Next winter could be the Fimbul- 
winter for all we know. Right now 
this planet is pretty well designed 
for us — but it need not stay that 
way, and in fact our historical in- 
quiries (conducted through pollens 
found in ocean cores, examination 
of tree rings, radiocarbon dating, 
etc.) convince us that it’s not likely 
to. Over the long haul things have 
got to change for the worse, and 
that haul may not be so very long. 

Which leads to the other conclu- 
sion about planetary engineering: 
why not? Nature did not design this 
Earth for us, and she is perfectly 
capable of changing things so that 
we can’t live here. 

We, on the other hand, have 
ways of modifying climate. We re- 
ally do have the capability to re- 
engineer this planet. It’s a frighten- 
ing capability — but it’s also very 
unlikely that any manmade accident 
will be large compared to what Na- 
ture is capable of all by herself. 

There’s another difference be- 
tween us and Nature. What we do 
is at least partly under control. 
Sure; the High Aswan dam has 
messed up the ecology of the east- 
ern Mediterranean (and US .^en- 
gineers in fact told the Egyptians it 
would, which is why we wouldn’t 
build it for them, and why they 
went to the Russians for help); but 
the High Aswan is not eternal, and 



in fact has had a pretty small effect 
compared to some natural events of 
that region. It wasn’t all that long 
ago that the Mediterranean was a 
dry desert. 

The High Aswan could, if need 
be, be removed. 

The NAWAPA canals and spill- 
ways and dams could, if need be, 
be taken out. The Pechora could, if 
necessary, be allowed to flow undis- 
turbed northwards. The Caspian 
could, if need be, be allowed to 
empty itself again. And so forth. 

Agreed: once such vast invest- 
ments have been made, the decision 
to undo them (probably undo them 
in part; not all of the effects would 
be detrimental) and thus forgo their 
benefits would not be easy to make. 
Politically and economically they 
would be the toughest decisions in 
history; but they would be possible 
decisions. 

Now tell me how to undo the ef- 
fects of a long period of quiet Sun? 
Or of vastly increased sunspots? Or 
of any of a number of other mys- 
terious changes Nature can make, 
arbitrarily and capriciously, in our 
environment — changes which we 
know (not merely wonder about as 
we wonder about the effects of 
NAWAPA) will have terrible con- 
sequences? 

Do we trust man or Nature? A 
few years ago that was an easy 
question to answer. Nature loves us. 
This is our planet, designed for our 
use. 

We can’t believe that any more. 

Hadn’t we better learn something 
about planetary engineering? We 
may need to terraform Terra; and 
we may need to do it sooner than 
we think. ★

The she ’ pan had her plans for the mri. But 
what were they? 



The mri. a species that survives 
by hiring out its warrior-caste as 
mercenaries, has served the regul 
merchants against humankind-in a 
war now lost. Thirteen mri pres- 
ently survive on the mri 
homeworld. Kesrith; a few hundred 
more are on ships scattered 
throughout known space. Those on 
Kesrith are the old and the infirm, 
save for Niun and his sister Melein. 

Niun . last son born to his dying 
species, has trained for all his 
young life to fight humans; but he is 
held onworld at the side of the aged 
she’ pan (queenimother) Intel, a 
battle-scarred and tired ruler ad- 
dicted to drugs and capricious in 
her exercise of power. 

She dismissed Niun’ s cousin 
Medai to the war, in honor, aboard 
the regul high-command ship, re- 
jecting Niun’s plea to go. She took 
Melein out of her chosen caste, the 
Kel (warriors), and put her among 
the scholarly sen-caste. She permits 
nothing to be done while the new 
regul governor, bai Hulagh, 
evacuates regul from Kesrith and 
prepares to hand Kesrith over to 
human occupation as part of the 
negotiated settlement of the war. 

Niun is horrified and angry at 
what he sees happening, regul leav- 
ing Kesrith and mri remaining 
onworld-but there is no way for a 
warrior to argue with the she’pan, 
even thougn she be mad and doom- 
ing the entire species to needless ex- 
tinction. 



In regul-maintained security, 
there are others now on Kesrith: 
Two human observers, Stavros and 
Duncan, have come in advance of 
the human occupation forces- 
Stavros as governor-to-be and chief 
negotiator, expert in alien affairs; 
and Duncan as his assistant, in re- 
ality a specialist in alien-terrain 
warfare. But the regul have man- 
aged to whisk them from Hulagh’ s 
ship to Kesrithi headquarters under 
such efficient security that they have 
never really seen Kesrith it- 
self . and Stavros chooses pa- 
tience under these conditions, an at- 
titude that the young officer Duncan 
does not find reasonable. Humans 
will be coming in very soon; ship 
after regul ship is going out, osten- 
sibly in a regul evacuation of per- 
sonnel. 

And Hulagh has meanwhile de- 
livered to the mri of Kesrith the dead 
body of his own attendant 
mercenary-suicide, say the regul, 
who are constitutionally incapable 
either of forgetting a fact or of 
lying-a death occasioned by the 
mercenary’ s despair over the end of 
the war. 

The young mercenary in question 
was Medai, Niun’s cousin; and as 
Niun sits the lonely deathwatch in 
the darkened Shrine of his people, 
there arrives a great dus, one of the 
Kesrithi beasts that have always ac- 
companied the mri to war: Each 
beast chooses a single mri warrior 
for life. This one is scarred, half- 

73 



THE FADED SUN 




starved, and in miuk, the madness 
that comes on a dus under extreme 
stress. 

Niun suspects that the beast is 
Medai’s, escaped from the regul 
ship . and its evidently pro- 
longed abuse suggests something 
sinister about Medai’s supposed 
suicide. No mri could abuse a dus, 
particularly his own; the relation- 
ship is too intimate. Yet regul can- 
not lie. 

Perplexed. Niun attempts to win 
over the suffering beast; it rejects 
him — a rejection he concludes is 
judgment on himself, an unfledged 
warrior, far less a man than he 
whom this beast has served before. 
It sits dying at their door, and Niun 
goes into the desert to bury his 
cousin and rival. 

But he learns then from his elders 
that Medai was considered and re- 
jected for Intel’s personal service. 
Niun suddenly perceives that there 
are many things he has not under- 
stood . and now he sees. He has 
been reserved by the she’ pan for a 
special reason; Intel’s actions seem 
now frighteningly purposeful from 
the beginning. It is the death of his 
species he foresees, and himself the 
she’ pan’s last warrior. 

Meanwhile the violent nature of 
Kesrith strikes its own blow; A 
storm comes down on the regul cap- 
ital, and in the resulting chaos 
Stavros suffers a paralyzing 
stroke-by no means a distressing 
condition to regul who, in adult- 
hood, normally lose mobility and 
become confined to prosthetic sleds. 
Stavros can function by adaptation 
to a such regul device, but he is 
more helpless than a regul under 
such circumstances. 



Duncan becomes Stavros’ eyes 
and ears in the regul headquarters, 
and Duncan has always disagreed 
with Stavros’ acquiescence in their 
confinement. Now, with Stavros ill, 
he finds himself having to deal with 
a species that reveres elders but 
thinks nothing of killing an inconven- 
ient youngling — which is his status 
in regul estimation. 

Nor is Hulagh himself untouched 
by catastrophe. The storm has crip- 
pled the port and damaged his ship. 
It is impossible for him to continue 
the systematic plunder of Kesrith, 
for Hulagh was doing just that, en- 
riching himself and engineering a 
coup that would have disgraced the 
human envoys and saved regul 
honor, robbing the humans of the 
wealth they had gained in the trea- 
ty- 

Now it is a question of even 
being able to evacuate regul per- 
sonnel in time, for the human forces 
will come within a very few days. 

Then Hulagh learns that a mri 
warship is incoming, and in panic 
he pays an unprecedented call on 
the mri she’ pan, trying to trick the 
Kesrithi mri into boarding his ship. 
Intel refuses and he departs in frus- 
tration, knowing that he cannot con- 
trol the mri without she’ pan Intel in 
his hpnds. 

A new report reaches him; The 
incoming mri ship contains not the 
usual handful, but hundreds of mri, 
perhaps the remainder of the 
species. Kesrith is their chosen 
homeworld, and they are coming in 
to join Intel. 

With this the specter of all-out 
war is before Hulagh-a mri-human 
confrontation that will undo the 
peace and destroy them all; regul 



74 GALAXY 




cannot fight; and they can no 
longer restrain the events that are 
proceeding about them. The mri 
will be unleashed in a war of their 
own choosing, with their former 
employers caught in the middle. 



XIII 

The rain came, a gentle enemy, 
against the walls of the edun. The 
winds rushed down, but the moun- 
tain barrier and the high rocks broke 
their force and sent them instead 
skirling down slopes toward the 
regul town and port. No strong 
wind had ever touched the edun, 
not in two thousand years. 

It was comfortable on such a 
night to take common-meal, all 
castes together in the she’pan’s tow- 
er. All evening long there had 
been a curious sensitivity in the air, 
a sense of violent pleasure, of satis- 
faction as strong as the storm 
winds. The dusei, mood-sensitive, 
had grown so restive that they had 
been turned out of the edun al- 
together, to roam where they pleased 
this night. They disappeared into 
the dark, all but the miuk'ko at the 
gate, that found no discomfort at all 
in the world’s distempers. 

And the spirits of the kel’ein 
were high. Old eyes glittered. There 
was no mention of the ship that was 
coming, but it was at the center of 
everything. 

Niun, likewise among the keTein, 
felt the surge of hope at the arrival 
of Ahanal. Of a sudden, dizzying 
views opened before his feet. 
Others. Brothers, Rivals. Challenge, 

THE FADED SUN 



and hope of living. And himself, 
even unfledged, even without exper- 
ience in war, hitherto no person of 
consequence; but this was home- 
world, and he of homeworld’s Kel; 
and he was, above all, the she’- 
pan’s kel’en. It was a heady, un- 
accustomed feeling, that of being 
no longer the least but one among 
the first. 

“We have been in contact with a 
mri ship,’’ was all the word the 
she’pan had given them that morn- 
ing before the arrival of the regul 
bai; and that, outside its name, was 
all that they knew. The Lady 
Mother had gathered them together 
in the dawning and spoken to them 
quietly and soberly, and it was an 
effort for her, for she lay insensible 
so much of the time. But for a mo- 
ment, a brief moment, there had 
been an Intel Niun had never before 
seen: It had awed him, that soft- 
voiced, clear-headed stranger who 
spoke knowledgeably about lanes 
and routings around Kesrith that 
were little-monitored by regul. In 
riddles she spoke at times, but not 
then. “Soon,” she had said. “Very 
soon. Keep your eyes on the regul, 
kel’ein.” 

And quickly then, more quickly 
than they had anticipated, the regul 
bai had come, making them offers. 

The regul were concerned. They 
were presented with something that 
had never happened before, and 
they were alarmed and confused. 

“Intel,” said Eddan, her eldest 
Husband, when dinner was done 
and Niun had returned from carry- 
ing the utensils to the scullery — that 
and the storerooms being the only 
parts of the Kath-tower that re- 
mained open. “Intel, may the Kel 



75 




ask permission to ask a question?” 
Niun settled among the kel’ein 
quickly, anxious and at once grate- 
ful that Eddan had waited until his 
return; and he looked at Intel’s face, 
seeking some hope that she would 
not deny them. 

She frowned. ‘‘Is the Kel going 
to ask about the ship?” 

‘‘Yes,” said Eddan, ‘‘or anything 
else worth the knowing.” 

The she’pan unfolded her hands, 
permission given. 

‘‘When it comes,” asked Eddan, 
‘‘do we go or do we stay?” 

‘‘Kel’ein, I will tell you this: that 
1 have seen that Kesrith’s use is 
near its end. Go, yes; and I will tell 
you something more: that I owe the 
regul bai one kel’en, but no more. 
And 1 do much doubt that he will 
come back to collect that promise of 
me.” 

Old Liran, veilless as they all 
were veilless in the intimacy of the 
common-meal, grinned and made a 
move of his scarred hand. 

‘‘Well, she’pan. Little Mother, if 
he does come back, send me. I 
would like to see whether Nurag is 
all it is claimed to be; and I would 
be of scant use in the building of 
another edun. This one, all cracks 
as it is, is home; and if I am not to 
stay with this one, why, I might as 
well take service again.” 

‘‘Would a service among the 
People not do as well, Liran?” 

‘‘Yes, Little Mother, well 
enough,” Liran answered, and his 
old eyes flickered with interest. He 
darted a glance at Eddan, an appeal: 
Ask questions, eldest. The whole 
Kel sat utterly still. But the she’pan 
had turned their question aside. 
Eddan did not ask again. 

76 



“Sathell,” said Intel. 

‘‘She’pan?” 

‘‘Cite for the Kel the terms of the 
treaty that binds us to the service of 
regul.” 

Sathell bowed his head and lifted 
it again. ‘‘The words of the treaty 
between doch Holn and mri are the 
treaty that keeps us in service to the 
regul. The pertinent area: So long 
as regul and mri alone occupy the 
homeworld, whereon the edun of 
the People rests ... or until regul 
depart the homeworld, whereon the 
edun of the People rests . This 
long we are bound to accept service 
with regul when called upon. And I 
hold, she’pan, that in spirit, if not 
in letter, regul have already failed 
in the terms of that treaty.” 

“Surely,” said the she’pan, “we 
are not far from that point. We con- 
tracted with doch Holn. Doch Holn 
might have known how to deal with 
us, but this bai Hulagh is apparently 
of Nurag itself, and I do not think 
he knows the People. He erred seri- 
ously when he did not take urgent 
care to see to our evacuation long 
before now.” 

“Holn knew better,” said 
Sathell. 

“But Holn neglected to pass on 
to her successor all that she might 
have told him. The old bai Solgah 
kept her silence. Neither do regul 
tend to consult written records. The 
regulkind do not make good fight- 
ers, but they are, in their own way, 
very clever at revenge.” 

And Intel smiled, a tired smile 
that held a certain satisfaction. 

“May the Kel,” asked Eddan, 
“ask permission to ask a ques- 
tion?” 

“Ask.” 



GALAXY 




“Do you think the Holn deliber- 
ately excluded us from the assets 
she turned over to this bai 
Hulagh?” 

“I believe the Holn will consider 
this a stroke of revenge, a salve to 
their pride, yes. Bai Hulagh has lost 
the mri. In such manner regul fight 
against regul. What is that to us? 
But I am sure of this,” she said in 
a hard tone, “that Medai was the 
last of my children to leave on a 
regul ship, the last of my children 
to die for regul causes. And hereaf- 
ter, hereafter, kel’ein, do not plan 
that mri should fight mri again. No. 
We do not fight.” 

There was palpable dismay in the 
whole Kel. 

“May the Kel ask — ?” Eddan 
began, unshakably formal. 

“No,” she said. “The Kel may 
not ask. But I will tell you what is 
good for you to know. The People 
.are dangerously declined in 
numbers. Time was when such 
fightings served the People; but no 
longer, no longer, kel’ein. I will tell 
you a thing you did not ask. The 
ship Ahatu^ bears what remains of 
all the People, and we are the rest. 
There are no more.” 

There was cold in the room, and 
no one moved. Niun locked his 
arms tightly about his knees, trying 
to absorb personally what the 
Mother had said, hoping that it was 
allegory, as she often spoke in rid- 
dles. But there was no way to be- 
lieve it a figure of speech. 

“At Elag,” said Intel in a thin, 
hard voice, “while regul evacuated 
their own kind, they threw the 
kel’ein that served them against 
humans again and again and again, 
and summoned the kel’ein of Mlas- 

THE FADED SUN 



sul and Seleth edunei, and lost them 
as well. But this mattered little to 
regul, to this new bai, Hulagh, to 
this new master sent out from 
Nurag.” 

There was a sudden sound, an 
impact of fist on flesh; and Eddan, 
who did not swear, swore. 
“She’pan,” he said then. “May the 
Kel ask—” 

“There is nothing more to ask, 
Eddan,” said Intel. “That is the 
thing that happened, the thing that 
cost ten thousand mri lives, and 
also ships — ships of which I do not 
know the tally. Many, many of the 
ships were regul, without regul per- 
sonnel aboard because the regul 
feared to stay. They killed ten 
thousand mri. And I curse the 
she’panei who lent their children to 
such as that. ’ ’ 

A fine sweat beaded Intel’s face, 
and pallor underlay her skin. The 
sound of her breathing was audible, 
a hoarseness, above the sound of 
the rain outside. Never had the gen- 
tle Mother cursed anyone, and now 
the enormity of cursing other 
she’panei chilled the heart; neither 
was there repentance on her face. 

Niun drew his breaths carefully, 
sucking in air as if he drew it off 
the noon-heated sands. His muscles 
began to tremble and he clenched 
his hands the harder lest someone 
notice it, if anyone could notice 
anything but his own heartbeat in 
that terrible silence. 

“Little Mother,” Sathell pleaded. 
“Enough. Enough.” 

“The Kel,” she said, “finds it 
necessary to ask questions. It is due 
an answer.” And she paused for a 
moment, drawing great breaths as 
though she intended next something 



77 




very necessary, something urgent. 
“Kel’ein,” she said, “chant me the 
Shon'Jir. ” 

There was a stirring among the 
kel’ein, mounting panic and dis- 
may. She is dying was Niun’s first 
thought, and O Gods, what an ill 
omen of things! And he could not 
say the words she asked of them. 

“Are you children,” she asked of 
her Husbands, “to believe any 
longer in luck, either good or bad? 
Chant me the passing-ritual.” 

They looked at Eddan, who in- 
clined his head in a gesture of sur- 
render and began, softly. Niun 
joined them, uncertain in this insan- 
ity in which they were bidden join. 

From Dark beginning 
To Dark at ending. 

Between them a Sun, 

But after comes Dark, 

And in that Dark 
One ending. 

From Dark to Dark 
Is one voyage. 

From Dark to Dark 
Is our voyage. 

And after the Dark, 

O brothers, O sisters. 

Come we home. 

Intel listened with her eyes closed 
and afterward there was a long si- 
lence; then her lids lifted, and she 
looked on all of them as from a far 
place. 

“1 give you,” she said, “a 
knowledge which kel’ein knew long 
ago, but which passed from the 
Kel-lore. Remember it again. I 
make it lawful. Kesrith is only a be- 
tween, and Arain only one of many 
suns, and we are near an ending. In 

78 



the People’s history, kel’ein, are 
many such Darks; and the regul 
have afforded us only the latest of 
our many homes. For this reason 
we call it Shon’jir, and in the low 
language, the passing-ritual. For 
this reason we say it at the begin- 
ning of each life of the People and 
at each life’s ending; and at the be- 
ginning of each era and at its end- 
ing. Until another she’pan shall bid 
your children’s children, Niun, 
forget what I have told you. Only 
the Kel may remember.” 

“Mother,” he said, raising a 
hand to her in entreaty, “Mother, is 
it the moving of homeworld you 
mean?” 

Too long she had been mother to 
him, and he realized after he had 
spoken his question that she was 
due more courtesy; he sat with his 
heart pounding, waiting to hear her 
coldly rebuff him by asking Eddan 
if the Kel had a question to pose. 

But she neither frowned nor re- 
fused his question. “Niun, I give 
you more truth to ponder. The regul 
call themselves old; but the People 
are older. The two thousand years 
of which you know are only an 
interlude. We are nomads. I say 
that the Kel shall pot fight; but the 
Kel has other purposes. Last of my 
sons, the Kel of the Darks is a dif- 
ferent Kel than the Kel of the Be- 
tween. Last of my daughters, as- 
suming the she’panate of the Darks 
is a duty 1 do not envy you.” 

Upon an instant the whole Kel 
was tom, each one of them, into a 
fearful, astonished attention. 

The succession was passed, not 
in fact, but in intent; and Niun 
looked at his onetime brothers and 
saw their dismay; and he looked at 

GALAXY 




Melein and saw her pale and shak- 
en. She veiled herself and turned 
away from them; and of a sudden 
he felt himself utterly alone, even 
there, amid the Kel. He bowed his 
head and stayed so while the voice 
of Eddan, subdued, begged leave 
to question, which request the 
she’pan refused. 

“The Sen asks,” said Sathell’s 
voice then, and by that a question 
was posed that could not be re- 
fused. “She’pan, we cannot make 
these plans without consulting to- 
gether.” 

“Is that a question, sen?” the 
she’pan asked dryly, and in the 
shock of that collision of wills, 
there was silence. Niun looked at 
them, from one to the other, appall- 
ed that those who ruled his life did 
not agree. 

“It is a question,” said Sathell. 

The she’pan bit at her lip and 
nodded. “Yet,” she said, “we have 
made these plans without consult- 
ing. I did not consult when I made 
sure that Ahanal was reserved from 
the madness at Elag. I did not con- 
sult when I maintained our base on 
Kesrith against the urging of some 
to leave. 1 have made these plans 
without consulting, and I have left 
the People no other choice.” 

“To the death of our Kath and 
most of our Kel, when we might 
have had Lushain for homeworld 
instead, where there is water and 
gentle elimate, where we might 
have had a rich world, she’pan.” 

“That old quarrel,” she said in a 
still voice. “But I had my way, 
Sathell, because the she’pan, not 
the sen’anth, leads the People. Re- 
member it.” 

“The Sen asks,” said Sathell in a 

THE FADED SUN 



trembling voice, "why. Why must it 
have been Kesrith?” 

“Is your knowledge adequate? 
Do you know the last Mysteries, 
sen’anth?” 

“No,” Sathell acknowledged, an 
answer wrung from him. 

“Kesrith was the best choice.” 

“I do not believe it.” 

“I said at the time,” said Intel 
softly, “that I decided as I saw fit. 
That is still true. I do not require 
your belief.” 

“This I know,” said Sathell. 

“Kesrith is hard. It kills the 
weak. It has performed its func- 
tion.” 

“This forge of the People, as you 
called it, has performed its function 
too well. We are too few. And Elag 
has left us with nothing.” 

“Elag has left us with a remnant 
like the remnant of Kesrith,” said 
Intel. “With what has been through 
fire.” 

“A handful.” 

“We have given the People,” 
she said, “a place to stand, and 
stand we shall until humans stand 
on Kesrith. And then ... the Dark. 
After that — a decision that will be- 
long to others than you and me, 
Sathell.” 

There was silence. Sathell rose 
suddenly and caught at the wall for 
support, his weakness betraying 
him. “To others then,” he said, 
“let it pass now.” 

And he walked out. His footsteps 
descended the tower. 

Eddan bowed himself, went to 
Intel and took her hand. “Little 
Mother,” he said gently, “the Kel 
approves you.” 

“The Kel knows little,” she said, 
“even now.” 



79 




“The Kel knows the she ’pan,” 
he said, a faint voice. And then he 
looked about at the others, seeking 
Melein last of all. “Sen Melein, 
make the cup for her.” 

“I will not drink it tonight, Ed- 
dan,” Intel said. 

But Eddan’s look said otherwise, 
and Melein nodded, silent conspir- 
acy against Intel’s will, and rose 
and poured water and komal into a 
cup, preparing the draught that 
would give Intel ease. 

“Go,” said Eddan to the Kel. 

“Niun will stay,” said Intel, and 
Niun, who had risen with the 
others, stopped. 

Downstairs the main door opened 
and closed, a hollow crash. 

“Gods,” Pasev breathed and cast 
a look at Intel. “He is leaving the 
edun.” 

“Let him go,” said Intel. 

“She’pan,” said Melein’s voice, 
a clear note of anguish. “He cannot 
stay the night out there in the 
weather.” 

“I will go after him,” said De- 
bas. 

“No,” said the she’pan. “Let 
him go.” 

And after a moment it was clear 
that there was no changing her 
mind. 

There was nothing to be done. 
Melein settled at Intel’s side, still 
veiled, her eyes averted. 

“The Kel is dismissed,” said In- 
tel, “except Niun. Sleep well, 
kel’ein.” 

But Eddan did not wish to be 
dismissed. He stayed last of all, 
though Intel gestured him away. 

“Go,” she said. “There is noth- 
ing more I can tell you tonight, Ed- 
dan. In the morning set one of the 

80 



kel’ein to watch the port from the 
high rocks. Sleep now. This storm 
will keep the regul inactive, but to- 
morrow is another matter.” 

“No,” said Eddan. “I am going 
after my brother. ’ ’ 

“Without my blessing.” 

“All the same,” said Eddan, and 
he turned to go. 

“Eddan,” she said. 

He looked back at her. “We are 
getting too few,” he said, “to make 
many journeys to Sil’athen. Sathell 
would not willingly have left Nis- 
ren. Neither would I. Now we will 
not leave Kesrith. We will walk to- 
ward Sil’athen, he and I. Together 
we will be content.” 

“1 give my blessing,” she said 
after a moment. 

“Thank you,” he said, “she’pan.” 
“she’pan.” 

And that was all. Eddan left; and 
Niun stared after him into the dark 
of the hall, trembling in every mus- 
cle. 

They were as dead, Eddan and 
Sathell. They had chosen: Sathell, 
after the fashion of his kind, to take 
the long walk; and Eddan, untypical 
for his caste, to go with him. And 
Niun had seen Eddan’s face, and 
there was no heaviness in it. He 
heard the kel’anth’s steps going 
down the spiral, a quick and easy 
stride, and the door closed behind 
him too; and thus it was certain that 
the edun was now less by two lives, 
and they had been indeed great 
lives. 

“Sit by me,” Intel bade them. 
“She’pan,” said Melein in a 
thin, strained voice, “I have made 
your cup. Please drink it.” 

She offered it, and the tray shook 
in her hands. Intel took the cup 

GALAXY 




from her and drank and returned it, 
leaning back as Niun settled, kneel- 
ing, on her left hand, and Melein 
on her right. 

So they had spent many of the 
nights since Medai’s death, for In- 
tel’s sleep was not easy and she 
would not sleep without another in 
the room. 

This night Niun envied her the 
draught of komai, and he would not 
look at her as she waited for the 
draught to have effect but instead 
bowed his head and stared at his 
hands in his lap, shaken and shat- 
tered to his innermost heart. 

Eddan. Eddan and Sathell, that 
had been a part of all his life. He 
wept, naked- faced, and the tears 
splashed onto his hands, and he was 
ashamed to lift a hand to wipe them 
away, for the Kel did not weep. 

“Sathell is very ill,’’ said Intel 
softly, “and he knows well what he 
does. Do not think that we parted 
hatefully. Melein knows. Eddan 
knows. Sathell was a good man. 
Our old, old quarrel. .he never 
agreed with me, and yet for forty- 
three years he has given me his 
good offices. I do not grudge that 
he simply stated his opinion at the 
last. We were friends. And do not 
feel badly for Eddan. If he had 
done otherwise, I would have been 
surprised.’’ 

“You are hard,’’ said Niun. 

“Yes,” she said. And her slight 
touch descended on his shoulder, 
brushed aside the zaidhe. He slip- 
ped it off, wadded its cloth in his 
clenched fists, his head still bowed 
for his eyes were wet. “Last son of 
mine,” she said then, “do you love 
me?” 

The question, so nakedly posed, 

THE FADED SUN 



struck him like a hammer-blow; and 
in this moment he could not say 
smoothly, yes. Mother. He could 
not summon it. 

“Mother,” he said painfully — of 
her many titles, the best and dearest 
to the Kel. 

“Do you love me, Niun?” Her 
soft fingers brushed past his mane, 
touched the sensitivity of his ear, 
teasing the downy tufts at its crest, 
an intimacy for kinswomen and lov- 
ers. Here is a secret, the touch 
said, a hidden thing. Be attentive. 

He was not strong enough for se- 
crets now, nor for any added bur- 
den. He looked up at her, trying to 
answer. 

The calm face looked down on 
him with curious longing. “I 
know,” she said. “You are here. 
You pay me duty. That is still a 
good and pious act, child of mine. 
And I know that I have robbed you 
and denied you and compelled ev- 
erything that you have done and 
will ever do.” 

“I know that your reasons have 
been good ones.” 

“No,” she said. “You are 
kel’en. You do not know; you be- 
lieve. But you are proper to say so. 
And you are right. Tomorrow, to- 
morrow you will see it, when you 
seeAhanal. Melein. .” 

“She’pan.” 

“Do you mourn Sathell?” 

“Yes, she’pan.” 

“Do you dispute me?” 

“No, she’pan.” 

“There will be a she’pan on 
Ahanal," said Intel. “That she’pan 
is not fit as I have made you fit.” 

“I am twenty-two years old,” 
protested Melein. “She’pan, you 
could take command of Ahanal, but 



81 




if they challenge, if they should 
challenge — ” 

“Niun would defend me, defend 
me well. And he will defend you in 
your hour.” 

“Do you pass his duty to me?” 
Melein asked. 

“In time,” she said, “I will do 
this. In your time.” 

“I do not know all that I need to 
know, she’pan.” 

“You will kill,” said Intel, “any 
who try to take the Pana from you. 
I am the oldest of all she’panei, and 
I have prepared my successor in my 
own way.” 

“In conscience — ” Melein pro- 
tested. 

“In conscience,” said the 
she’pan, “obey me and do not 
question.” 

And the drug began to come over 
her and her eyes to dim, and she 
sank into her cushions and was still. 

It was said, in a tale told in the 
Kel, that at the fall of Nisren hu- 
mans had actually breached the 
edun, ignoring mri attempts to chal- 
lenge to a’ani: this the first and 
most bitter error the mri had made 
with humans. A human force had 
swept through the halls while the 
Kath in terror had tried to escape; 
Intel had put herself between hu- 
mans and the Kath, fired the hall 
with her own hand. Whether be- 
cause of Intel or the fire, those 
humans had not come against her. 
She had held long enough for some 
of the Kath to escape, until the em- 
battled Kel could reach that hall and 
get her to safety, aboard the 
regul ship. 

That aspect of the gentle Intel 
had always seemed incredible to 
Niun — until this night. 

82 



XIV 

Duncan heard the hum of 
machinery. It awakened him, advis- 
ing him at once that Stavros had 
need of something. He pulled him- 
self off the couch and gathered his 
fatigue-dulled senses. He had not 
undressed. He had not put Stavros 
to bed. Storm-alarms had made 
most of the night chaotic. There 
was a time that constant storm ad- 
visories were coming over com- 
munications. 

He heard the storm shields in 
Stavros’ quarters slide open. He 
went in, noting that the alarms were 
past and the screens showed clear. 
The dawn came up ruddy and 
murky, flooding a peculiar light 
through the glass. 

Stavros was sitting in the center 
of that glow, a curious figure in his 
mobile sled. He whipped it about, 
so as to face Duncan, with a jaunty 
expertise. The communication sc- 
reen lighted. 

Look outside. 

Duncan stepped up to the rain- 
spattered window and looked out- 
ward, scanning the desolate expanse 
of sand and rock, the sea and the 
towers of the water-recovery sys- 
tem. There was something wrong, a 
gap in the silhouette, a vacancy 
where yesterday structures had 
stood. 

There was a particularly dark area 
of cloud over the seacoast, flattened 
by the winds, tom and streamered 
out to sea. 

Stavros’ screen activated again. 

Advisory just given: water-usage 
confined to drinking and food prep- 
aration only. “Minor repairs at 
plant.’’ They ask we remain patient. 

GALAXY 




“But we’ve got people coming 
down here,’’ Duncan protested. 

Suspect further damage at port. 
Regul much disturbed. Bat ‘ 'not 
available.” 

The rain slacked off considerably, 
leaving only a few spatters on the 
windows. TTie murky light grew for 
a moment red, like that from fire; it 
was but Arain, through thick cloud. 

And on the long ridge that lay 
beyond the town there was a 
shadow that moved. Duncan’s eyes 
jerked toward it, strained upon that 
one spot. There was nothing to be 
seen. 

“I saw something out there,’’ he 
said. 

Yes, the screen advised him when 
he turned. Many. Many. Maybe 
flood drove beasts from holes. 

In a moment another shadow ap- 
peared atop the ridge. He watched 
as yet another, and another, and 
another, appeared. His eyes swept 
the whole circuit of the hills. 
Against the sullen light .there was a 
gathering row of black shapes that 
moved and milled aimlessly. 

Mri, he had feared. 

But not mri. Beasts. He thought 
of the great unpleasant beasts that 
had been found with dead mri, ur- 
sine creatures that could be as 
dangerous as their size warned. 

“They’re mri-beasts,’’ he said to 
Stavros. “They’ve got the whole 
area ringed.’’ 

Regul call them dusei. They are 
native to Kesrith. Read your brief- 
ings. 

“They go with mri. How many 
mri are supposed to be here? I 
thought it was only a handful.’’ 

So the bai assures us-a token 
presence, to be removed. 

THE FADED SUN 



Duncan looked at the horizon. 
The clouds stretched unbroken. And 
the dusei were a solid line across 
the whole ridge, encompassing the 
visible circuit of the sea to the 
town. 

Duncan turned from the sight of 
it, shivered, looked again. He con- 
sidered the rain, and the land. 
Working his sweating hands, he 
turned again and looked at Stavros. 
“Sir, I’d like to go out there.’’ 

“No,’’ Stavros murmured. 

“Listen to me.’’ Duncan found it 
awkward to talk at such an angle, 
dropped to one knee so that he 
could meet the old man eye to eye, 
set a hand on the cold metal of the 
sled. “We’ve got only regul word 
for it that the regul don’t lie; we’ve 
got mri out there; we’ve got a col- 
ony mission coming in here in a 
matter of days. You took me along. 
I assume you had some feeling then 
you might need me. I can get out 
there and take a look and get back 
without anyone the wiser. You can 
cover for me that long. Who cares 
about a youngling more or less? 
They won’t see me. Let me go out 
there and see what kind of situation 
we’re facing, with those ships com- 
ing in. We don’t know how bad it 
is with the water; we don’t know 
what shape the port is in. Are you 
that confident we’re always told all 
the truth?’’ 

Weather hazardous. And incident 
with regul likely. 

“That’s something I can avoid. 
It’s my job. It’s what I know how 
to do.’’ 

Argument persuasive. Can you 
guarantee no incident? 

“On my life.’’ 

Estimate correct. If incident oc- 

83 




curs, then regul law prevails out 
there. You understand? Survey 
facilities, plant, port, return. Can 
cover you till dark. 

“Yes, sir.” 

He was relieved in some part; he 
did not look forward to it. He knew 
the hazard better perhaps than Stav- 
ros did. But for once he and the 
Honorable Stavros were of one 
mind. Hunting out the hazards was 
more comfortable than ignoring 
them. 

He rose, looked outside, found 
the dusei’s dark line vanished in 
that brief interval. Blinking, he tried 
to see through the haze of rain but 
could make out little in the dis- 
tance. 

“Sir,” he murmured to Stavros 
by way of farewell; Stavros inclined 
his head, dismissing him. The sc- 
reen remained dark. 

He went quickly to his own quar- 
ters and changed uniforms, slipping 
into khaki weatherproofs and sealed 
boots, still common enough in ap- 
pearance that he did not think regul 
would notice the difference. He put 
into the several pockets a tight roll 
of cord, a knife, a packet of con- 
centrates, a penlight, whatever 
would fit without obvious outlines. 
He flipped the hood into the collar 
and zipped the closures. 

Then he strolled out into the hall 
on a pattern he had followed several 
times a day since he had studied the 
layout of the building, went down 
the hall to the left and out toward 
the observation-deck window. No 
one was in the hall. He opened the 
door and went out into the rain- 
chilled air, circled the low- 
walled observation deck, looked 
over his shoulder to see that the 

84 



hall beyond the doors was still 
clear. It was 

He quite simply sat down on the 
edge of the wall, held with his 
hands as he dropped, and let go. 
The regul stories were short by 
human standards. He landed on ce- 
ment at the bottom, but it was not a 
hard drop at all, only a flex of the 
knees; and the cement showed no 
tracks. By the time he reached the 
edge of the concrete and disap- 
peared into the gentle rolls of the 
landscape, he was confident that he 
was unobserved. 

He walked toward the waterplant, 
turning up the hood of his uniform 
as he went for he knew the warn- 
ings about the mineral- laden rains 
and cared to expose as little of his 
skin as possible. Now off the 
pavements of the city, he left tracks 
as plain as wet sand allowed, but he 
did not reckon to be tracked at all. 
He felt rather self-pleased in this, 
which he had thought about for 
days, idle exercise of his profes- 
sional mind during the long inactiv- 
ity in the Nom; the fact was that no 
regul could possibly have done what 
he had just done, and therefore the 
regul had not taken precautions 
against it. Such a drop would have 
been impossible to their heavy, 
short-legged bodies, and likewise 
there was no regul that could come 
tracking him crosslands. 

That would take a mri. 

And that was the only thought 
that made him a little less self- 
pleased than he might have been 
under the circumstances. He had 
wanted arms at the outset of the 
voyage, but the diplomats had de- 
nied them to him: unnecessary and 
provocative, they had reasoned. 

GALAXY 





Now he was unarmed but for the 
kit-knife in his pocket, and a mri 
warrior could carve him into small 
portions before he could come close 
enough to make use of it for de- 
fense. 

The fact was clear that should 
regul set a mri on his trail, he was 
dead; but then, he reasoned, should 
regul dare do that, the treaty was 
obviously worth nothing, and that 
fact had as well be known early. 

There was also the possibility that 
the mri were out in force and that 
they were not under regul control; 
and that, most of all, needed to be 
known. 

For that reason he exercised more 
caution than he would have had he 
feared only regul. He watched the 
ridges and the shadows of gullies 
and took care to look behind him, 
remembering the dark shapes that 

THE FADED SUN 



had moved upon the hills, the dusei 
that were out there somewhere; he 
crossed dus-tracks — long-clawed, 

ominous reminders that there were 
hunters aprowl other than regul or 
mri. 

Briefings said that the beasts did 
not approach regul dwellings. 

Briefings also said that crossing 
the flats off the roads was not rec- 
ommended. 

The jetting steam of geysers, the 
crunch of thin crusts underfoot, 
warned him that there was reason 
for this. He had to draw a weaving 
course around hot zones, approach- 
ing the lowest part of the flats, that 
near the seashore and the wa- 
terplant. 

There was a road of sorts, badly 
washed, along the seacoast. Parts of 
it were underwater. A regul land- 
sled was down in a trench, where it 



85 




had slid off the edge. 

Duncan sat down, winded in the 
thin, cold air, his head and gut ach- 
ing, and watched from a distance as 
a regul crew tried to extricate it. 

He could see the waterplant 
clearly from this vantage point. 
There was chaos there too, beyond 
its protective fences. The towers ex- 
tended far out into the white-capped 
water, and several of those towers 
were in ruins. From what he could 
see, there was no possibility they 
could be even cleared for repair in 
the few days remaining before 
human ships would arrive, certainly 
not with the prevailing weather. 
What was more, he could not see 
any evidence of heavy machinery 
available to make repairs. 

Realistically estimating, it was 
not going to be done at all. A large 
human occupation-force was going 
to land, having to depend totally on 
ships’ recycling: irritating, but 

possible — that is, if there were a 
place to land. 

He looked to the right along the 
shoreline, toward the city and be- 
yond, where he could see the low 
shape of the Nom; there were no 
buildings high enough to obstruct 
his view of the port. He recognized 
Hazan , saw its alien shape sur- 
rounded by gantries, a web of 
metal. 

There was no way to set a ship 
down on the volcanic crusts that 
overlay most of the lowlands. If the 
port were in the same condition as 
the waterplant , there was going to 
be merry chaos when the human 
forces tried to land. 

And the regul had not been for- 
ward to inform them of the extent 
of damages to the facilities at the 

86 



plant. They had not lied, but neither 
had they volunteered all the truth. 

He drew a breath of tainted air 
and looked behind him suddenly, 
chilled to realize that he had been 
thinking about something other than 
his personal safety for a few sec- 
onds. The horizon was clear. There 
were only the clouds. A man did 
not always find himself that fortu- 
nate in his lapses. 

He let go that breath slowly and 
gathered himself up, conscious of 
the pounding of his head and the 
throbbing of his heart in the thin 
air. He saw a way to move around 
some low rocks and a sandy shelf 
and so cross between the city and 
the sea, working toward the port. 
Regul were reputed to have dim 
eyesight, to be dull, as it happened, 
in all sensory capacities. He hoped 
that this was so. 

Stavros, sitting back in the em- 
brace of his regul machine, had said 
that he could cover his absence. He 
reckoned that Stavros might be 
good at that, skilled at argument 
and misleadings as he was. 

Out here he knew his own job, 
knew with a surety that the instinct 
that had drawn Stavros to choose a 
SurTac for Kesrith had been a true 
one. Stavros had not ordered him 
but had only relied on him, quietly 
waiting for him to move of his own 
accord, sensing, perhaps, that a man 
trained in the taking of alien terrain 
would know his own moment. 

He could not afford a mistake 
now. He was afraid, with a differ- 
ent sort of fear than he had ever 
known on a mission. He had oper- 
ated alone before, had destroyed, 
had escaped — his own life or death 
on his head. He was not accus- 

GALAXY 




tomed to working with the life or 
death of others weighing on his 
shoulders, with the burden of deci- 
sion falling upon him to say that an 
area was safe, or not safe, for the 
landing of a mission involving hun- 
dreds of lives, and policies reaching 
far beyond Kesritb. 

He did not like it; he far from 
liked it. He would have gladly cast 
the responsibility on any higher au- 
thority available; but Stavros, bound 
to his machine, had to believe either 
the regul or his own aide, and Dun- 
can desperately wanted to be right.

The edun woke quietly; the 
People moved in silence about the 
daily routine. Niun went back to the 
Kel, which was now empty- 
seeming; and the Kel sat in mourn- 
ing. Eddan did not return. 

And Pasev’s eyes bore that 
bruised look that told of little^sleep; 
but she sat unveiled, in command of 
her emotions. Niun brought her a 
special portion at breakfast, and it 
tore his heart that she would not 
eat. 

After breakfast the brothers Liran 
and Debas spoke together and then 
rose up and put on the belts with all 
their honors, and mez’ein and 
zaidh’ein, and gave their farewells. 

“Will you all leave?” asked 
Niun, out of turn and out of place, 
and terrified. And he looked then at 
Pasev, who had most reason to go, 
and did not. 

“You might be needed,” said 
Pasev to the brothers. 

“We will walk and enjoy the 
morning,” said Liran. “Perhaps we 
will find Eddan and Sathell.” 

the faded sun 



“Then tell Eddan,” she said 
softly, “that I will be coming after 
him when I have finished my 
duties, which he left to me. 
Goodbye, brothers.” 

“Goodbye,” they said together, 
and all the remaining Kel echoed 
“Goodbye,” and they two walked 
down from the tower and out across 
the road. 

Niun stood in the doorway to 
watch them go, a deep melancholy 
upon him; and a knot settled in his 
throat, considering their absence 
hereafter. They continued their way 
to the horizon, two shapes of black; 
and the sky was shadowed and 
threatening, and they had not so 
much as the comfort of their dusei 
in their journey, for none of the 
beasts had come home. 

The miuk'ko by the door had dis- 
appeared also, dead, perhaps, in the 
storm: Dusei went away to die, 
alone, like kel’ein that found no fur- 
ther hope in their lives. 

Loyd to Intel, Niun thought, and 
loyal to Kesrith, and foreseeing the 
end of both. Lira and Debas could 
not help now and so they departed, 
their honors on them, not seeking 
ritual-burial from a young kel’en al- 
ready too over-burdened with 
duties. 

They had chanted the rites last 
night. It was ill-omened; they all 
knew it. It was as if they had 
chanted them over Kesrith itself, 
and he suddenly foresaw that few of 
the old ones, if any at all, would 
board the ship. 

They did not want Intel’s dream. 
She had shown them the truth of the 
rites and they had not wanted it; 
they had seen only the old, familiar 
ways. 



87 




She had promised them change, 
and they would have none of it. 

He was otherwise shaped, formed 
by Intel’s hands and Intel’s wishes, 
and loyalty to Melein would hold 
him bound to Intel’s dream. He 
looked on the place in the rocks 
where the brothers had disappeared 
and could have wept aloud at what 
he then realized of them and of 
himself — for Pasev would follow 
rather than take ship into uncertain- 
ties for which she had no longing; 
and after her would go the others. 

He would never be one with the 
like of them; he was black-robe, 
plain-robe, honorless and untested, 
shaped for different ways. The Kel 
of the Darks, she had said, is a dif- 
ferent Kel. 

It was he that already stood in the 
Dark; and they had walked away 
from the shadow, departed now into 
what they knew. 

He turned, to seek the edun, the 
Shrine’s comfort for his mood; and 
his heart chilled at what he saw 
along the lower ridges, row upon 
row of shadows moving there. 

Dusei. 

They ringed the regul town in 
every place that offered solid 
ground. Ha-dusei, wild ones, and 
dangerous. 

The dusei of the edun had not re- 
turned. 

And there were far too many of 
the ha-dusei, far too many. 

The sky roiled overhead, stained 
with red and sullen gray: storm- 
friends, the dusei, weather- 
knowing. In the days before the 
edun stood, they had watered here 
below: the Dus-plain, the lowland 
flats were called. They came as if 
they sensed change in the winds; 

88 



they came as if awaiting the regul 
departure, which would return the 
Dus-plain to the dusei. 

Waiting. 

It was told of regul stubbornness 
that the first mri had warned the 
regul earnestly that they should 
build their city elsewhere, as the 
edun itself had been carefully 
positioned off the plain in respect of 
the bond between mri and dusei; but 
regul had wanted rock for their 
ships to land on and they had 
sounded the area thereabouts and 
found only on the Dus-plain rock 
suitable for a port near the sea. 
Therefore regul had built there, and 
there had grown a city, and the ha- 
dusei had gone away. 

But dusei returned now, with the 
unseasonal rains and the destroying 
winds. They sat and waited. 

And the dusei had abandoned 
even the mri. 

Niun shrugged, half a shiver, and 
walked inside and stopped, not 
wishing to bear that news to the 
Kel, or to the she ’pan. The Kel was 
in mourning, the she’pan still lost in 
dreams; and Melein, her Chosen, 
had veiled herself and sealed herself 
alone in the Sen-tower. 

He cast a yearning thought sky- 
ward, through the spiral corridors 
that massed over him, that Ahanal 
hasten its coming, for he did not 
think that he could bear the endless 
hours until the evening. 

And each thing that he thought of 
doing this day was pointless, for it 
was a house to which they would 
never return; and outside, the 
weather threatened and the light- 
nings flashed in the clouds and the 
thunder rumbled. 

So he sat down in the doorway, 

GALAXY 




watching all the flats below, the 
geysers’ plumes, predictible as the 
hours, their clouds torn and thrown 
by gale-force winds. It was a cold 
day, as few days on Kesrith were 
chill. He shivered and watched the 
heavy drops pock the puddles that 
reflected a sky like frre-on-pewter. 

A heavy body trod the wet sand: 
a whuff of breath, and a great dus 
lumbered round the comer, head 
hanging. Others followed. He 
scrambled up in terror, not sure of 
their mood; but wet and muddy- 
pawed, they came on and nosed 
their way past him into the edun, 
rumbling that hunger-sound that be- 
tokened a dus with a considerable 
impatience. He counted them in:^ 
one, two, three, four, five, six. And 
last came the miuk’ko, the seventh, 
bedraggled and angular, to cast it- 
self down in the puddle at the base 
of the slanted walls, drinking with 
great laps of its gray tongue at the 
water between its massive paws. 

Three did not come. Niun waited, 
a relief and a disquiet growing in 
him at the same time — relief be- 
cause a bereaved dus was dangerous 
and pitiable, disquiet because he did 
not know how they had known. 
Perhaps the three that were missing 
had encountered their kel’ein. 

Or perhaps, with that curious 
sense of dusei, they had known and 
sought them. Perhaps they were far 
along the trail to Sil’athen. He ear- 
nestly hoped so; it would be best 
for both men and dusei. 

He went to the storerooms in the 
cellar of Kath. The dusei must have 
care. 

And first of all of them, he 
waited on the miuk’ko, that had left 
its post of mourning for the first 

THE FADED SUN 



time and then returned. He hoped it 
would be in a different mind. 

But it would not eat. Perhaps, he 
thought, it had fed during its hours 
of wandering. But he did not be- 
lieve it. He left the food on the dry 
edge of the step and went to carry 
portions to the others. 

Save for the insistence and ir- 
reverence of the dusei, save for Me- 
lein, who grieved in her tower, the 
edun had become a place of 
dreams, and a sense of finality hung 
over everything: the dus by the 
gate, the old men and the old wo- 
men. He crept about his tasks with 
the utmost quiet, as if Re, alone liv- 
ing, walked in the caves at 
Sil’athen. 

And in the evening the ship 
came. 

•k -k -k 

The she ’pan was asleep when 
they heard it descending; and they 
that were left of the Kel hurried out 
to the road to see it, and on tired 
faces there were smiles, and in 
Niun’s heart there was misgiving. 
Dahacha took his arm on impulse 
and pressed it, and he looked at the 
sun-wrinkled eyes and felt an un- 
spoken blessing pass between them. 

“Dahacha,” he whispered. “Will 
you come, at least?” 

“We that have not walked will 
come,” said the old man. “We will 
not send you alone, Niun Zain- 
Abrin. We have made our reckon- 
ing. If we would not, we would 
have gone with Eddan, like Liran 
and Debas.” 

“Yes,” said Palazi at his other 
side. “We will reason with the 
kel’anth.” 



89 




And it struck him, like a blow 
upon a wound, that this now refer- 
red to Pasev. 

The commotion of the ship’s 
landing was visible in lights, in the 
flares of regul headlights that 
crawled serpent-wise toward that far 
side of the field, half-glow in the 
red twilight — regul eyes were not 
adapted to the night. 

“Come,” said Pasev, and they 
followed her into the halls and up- 
ward to the she’pan’s tower. 

Melein was there beside Intel, 
and she touched the she’pan’s hand 
and tried to awaken her, but it was 
Pasev who laid a firm grip on the 
she’pan’s arm and shook her from 
her dreams. 

“She’pan,” said Pasev, “she’ 
pan, the ship has come.” 

“And the regul?” In the 
she’pan’s golden eyes the dream 
finished and that keenness returned, 
focused and struggling for control. 
“How do the regul bear it?” 

“We do not know that yet,” said 
Pasev. “They are all astir, that is 
all we saw.” 

Intel nodded. “No contact by 
radio. Regul will be monitoring; 
Ahanal will observe that caution 
also.” She struggled with the cush- 
ions, a small moue of pain upon her 
face; and Melein adjusted them for 
her. She sighed and breathed easily 
for a moment. 

“Shall we,” asked Dahacha, 
“Little Mother, carry you to the 
ship? We can bear you.” 

“No,” she said with a sad smile. 
“A she’pan is guardian of the Pana. 
There is no ship-going for me until 
that care of mine is finally dis- 
charged.” 

“At least,” said Dahacha then, 
90 



“let us take you down to the road, 
so that you can see toward the 
port.” 

“No,” said Intel, firmly. And 
then she touched Dahacha ’s hand 
upon the arm of her chair and 
smiled. “Do not fear; I am in pos- 
session of my faculties and in pos- 
session of this edun and this world, 
and so I will remain until I am sure 
that it is my time; and yours will 
not be until mine is. Do you hear 
me?” 

“Aye,” said Pasev. 

Intel met the eyes of the kel’anth 
and nodded, satisfied; but then her 
glance strayed about the room, 
perhaps counted faces, and her eyes 
clouded. 

“Liran and Debas left some time 
ago,” said Pasev. “We gave them 
farewell.” 

“My blessing,” she murmured 
dutifully. 

Pasev bowed her head in acknowl- 
edgment. “Until the she’pan dis- 
misses me,” she said, “I serve 
you, and there are still enough of us 
to do what needs doing.” 

“We will not be long about it,” 
sai^ Intel. “Niun, child,” she said, 
and held out her hand. 

He knelt at her knee and took her 
hand in his, bowed his bared head 
to her touch, felt her fingers slip 
from his and give that gesture of 
blessing. 

“Go crosslands,” she said. “Go 
to the ship and talk with the visitors 
face to face, and hear what they 
have to say. Answer wisely. You 
may have to take decisions on your- 
self, young kel’en. And do not go 
carelessly. We have almost ceased 
to serve regul.” 

Something passed his bowed 

GALAXY 




head; he felt weight settle on his 
neck, and caught at it, and his fin- 
gers closed on cold metal. When he 
turned it and looked at the amulet 
on the chain, he saw the open- 
hand-emblem of Kesrithun edun. In- 
tel’s silken fingers touched his chin 
and lifted his face to meet her eyes. 

“Only one ftal," she said softly, 
“but a master-one. Do you recog- 
nize it, my last son?” 

“It is an honor,” he said, “of a 
she’pan’s kel’en.” 

“Bear yourself well,” she said. 
“And make speed. Time is impor- 
tant now.” 

And she pushed at him with her 
fingers and he rose, almost fearing 
the eyes of the others — the kel’ein 
who might have been honored with 
such a j’tal — for he was the 
youngest and the least. But there 
was no envy in them, only glad- 
ness, as if this were something in 
which they were all agreed. 

He took off his house-robe, and 
there in the she’pan’s chamber they 
all took hand in preparing him for 
the journey, hastening to bring him 
the siga that he should wear in 
walking the dusty lands, and zaidhe 
and mez', and they gave him their 
own weapons, both yin’ein and za- 
hen’ein, finer than his own; and 
with a smile, a laugh that depre- 
cated superstition older than mem- 
ory among the People, Palazi un- 
dipped a luck-amulet from his own 
belts and gave it to him, a maiden 
warrior, giving him of his luck. 

“Years and honors,” said Palazi. 

He hugged the old man, and the 
others, and returned to the she’pan 
for a last hasty bow at her feet, his 
heart pounding with excitement. But 
as he received her kiss upon his 

the faded sun 



brow, she did not let him go at 
once, but stared into his face in 
such a way that it chilled all the 
blood within him. 

“You are beautiful,” the she’pan 
said to him, her golden eyes brim- 
ming with tears. “I have a great 
fear. Be careful, youngest son.” 

The People no longer believed in 
presciences with any great fervor, 
no more than he really trusted 
Palazi’s luck-wish; but he shivered 
all the same. There was mri-reason 
and regul-reason; and to believe 
only what could be demonstrated by 
experience, that was the regul way, 
not the mri. 

One who had lived as many years 
as Intel might have reasons he did 
not understand. His whole life had 
been spent in the presence of the 
forbidden and the incomprehensible; 
and she’pan Intel had been involved 
in most; she’pan — keeper of the 
Mysteries. 

“I shall be careful,” he said, and 
she let him go then. He avoided the 
eyes of Melein when he rose, for if 
the she’pan and her Chosen shared 
anything concerning him, he did not 
want to carry it with him on this 
mission. 

“Do not trust any regul,” said 
the kel’anth. “See all that you look 
upon.” 

“Yes,” he agreed earnestly, and 
took Pasev’s hands and pressed 
them gently by way of farewell to 
the brothers and sister of his caste. 

He turned away quickly and left, 
long strides carrying him hurriedly 
down the spiraling stairs, past the 
written names of the history and 
heroes of the People and the truth 
of all the things that Intel had 
hinted at, things that he could not 



91 




read. He felt their meaning this day, 
the remembrance of his ancestors. 

All, all that Intel had desired, had 
been passed down to him; and she 
had been able, at the last, to let him 
go, to cast him like the as-ei in 
short’ ai. And she had not lost him. 
There was too much of love poured 
into him by these old ones that he 
could fail the wishes of Eddan, of 
Intel, of Pasev and Debas and Li- 
ran. They had made sure that he 
would succeed before they had 
launched him about the she’pan’s 
mission. 

He passed the main doors and 
closed them against the night, and 
saw there the monstrous bulk of the 
miuk’ko, a shadow beside the door. 
The great head lifted and the eyes 
stared at him in the dark. 

Perhaps, he thought, optimism 
uncrushed in a hundred repetitions 
of this coming and going, perhaps 
this time. It would be good if it 
were this time at last, he who needs 
me, I who need him. 

But it murmured and turned its 
face and laid its massive head in the 
mud. Male, female, or neither; no 
one had ever ascertained the sex of 
a dus, or reckoned why it came to 
one mri or why it refused to come 
to another; whether this one had yet 
comprehended that Medai would 
never return, whether it grieved, or 
whether it starved out of simple 
stupidity, waiting for Medai to feed 
it, Niun could not fathom. 

With a sad shrug he went his 
way, scarcely having paused that 
half-step; but in this passing there 
was a difference, for things the dus 
did not understand had changed, 
were changing, were about to 
change. And it was doomed, having 

92 



rejected him. 

Likely the humans would destroy 
the dusei. Regul would have done 
so gladly, if not for mri protection. 
The size and the slow-moving 
power of dusei were very like those 
of regul, but regul instinctively 
hated the dusei. Regul could not, as 
mri could, become immune to the 
poison of the claws; they could not, 
as mri could, abandon themselves to 
the simplicity of the beasts. There- 
fore regul fled them. 

The unease the contact of the dus 
had left in Niun stayed the while he 
walked down toward the flats, to- 
ward the ghostly plumes of geysers 
under the wind-tom clouds. He 
smelled the wind, felt the familiar 
force of it, like some living thing. 

He found himself looking at the 
familiar places he had seen and 
known all his life and thinking of 
each: This is almost the last time. 
There was an excitement in his 
heart and an uncertainty in his 
stomach that were far from heroic 
and cheerful. His senses were alive 
to the whole world, to the scents of 
the earth, acrid and wet, to the feel 
of the damp, hot breath of the gey- 
sers, that each had their name and 
manner. 

His world. 

Home world. 

Impermanent as the wind, the 
Kel, but capable of loving the earth. 
It struck him that they did not know 
where they were going, that Intel 
spoke of the Dark as if it were a 
place, as if it had dimension and 
depth and duration like the world it- 
self. It came to him that after leav- 
ing Kesrith he might never feel 
earth under his feet again; a Dark 
with promise, the she’pan had in- 

GALAXY 




sisted, but he could not imagine 
what it promised. 

And hereafter to deal with kel’ein 
who were not old, long-thinking 
men — with kel’ein who knew only 
war and were touchy of their pride 
and their prerogatives of caste, in a 
way that the gentle Kel of Kesrith 
had never been. 

To live among the Kel of stran- 
gers, where there were kath’ein who 
would be his for the asking, and the 
chance to get children, and to see 
his private immortality. He would 
be son to one she’pan, truebrother 
to another, honored next whatever 
fen’ein. Husbands, she would 
choose to sire her children on the 
kel’e’ein and the kath’ein of the 
edun, if first he survived the combat 
of succession. 

Choices spread before him in 
dazzling array, in dizzying profu- 
sion, foretelling a future full of 
things neither stale, nor predictible, 
nor sure. 

He walked swiftly, passing where 
reeking sulphur and steam obscured 
his way, where water dripped from 
recently sprayed rocks and the heat 
underground prepared further erup- 
tions. He knew his timing to a 
nicety. The thin crusts on the 
right — boiling water and mud under- 
lay much of that ground. The edge 
that he trod would bear a mri’s 
weight but not that of a dus or a re- 
gul. Regul had learned bitter lessons 
about Kesrith’s flatlands; they did 
not stray now from the safety of 
their vehicles and aircraft and care- 
fully chosen roads and landing-sites. 
It would need a long time for hu- 
mans to learn the land, if they 
would ever dare leave the security 
of the regul city. 

the faded sun 



Some would surely die learning 
it. A few mri had done so. 

He could cease to care what hu- 
mans did. They would gather up the 
People arid go, all of them, 
Dahacha and Palazi and the others; 
and Intel too — they would persuade 
her too. Although she was old and 
very tired of struggles, she could at 
least begin the journey. 

And then they could leave with- 
out even wanting to look back. 

He stood at last atop the long 
white ridge that was above the port 
and saw the shape of the regul ship 
Hazan, and opposite it, the new one 
of A hanal. 

Ahanal — the Swift. 

He slid down the moonlit ridge in 
a white powdering of dust and cross- 
ed the long slope to the lower 
ground. 

And a shadow flowed among the 
rocks, large and menacing. He 
turned, hand on his pistol, and 
looked up at the hulking form that 
had mounted a ridge. 

Ha-dus. For a moment he did not 
breathe, did not move. Three others 
showed. Silent, the great beasts 
could be, when they stalked; but 
they did not stalk him. He had only 
disturbed their vigil. 

He remained still, respectful of 
their right to be here, and they snuff- 
ed the air and regarded him with 
their small eyes, and finally gave 
that explosive question-sound that 
indicated the fighting-mood was not 
upon them. 

Pardon, brothers, he wished 
them in his mind, which was the 
best way to deal with a strange and 
skittish dus, and backed a few paces 
before he edged on toward his 
former course; language the dus un- 



93 




derstood, a matter of movements 
that one made or did not make. 

His hand shifted from the pistol 
to the amulet at his breast. It was 
not the moment to risk his life with 
the ha-dusei, far from it; and he 
walked more slowly, more cau- 
tiously, remembering Pasev’s ad- 
monishment to use his eyes and his 
wits. 

They let him go, and when he 
looked back, they were no longer 
there. 

He walked from the white dust to 
the artificial surface that covered the 
firm rock of the northern rim area; 
and there was a fence, a laughable 
affair of wire screen that could stop 
nothing that was truly determined, 
not on Kesrith. He burned it, made 
himself a door in it, with fine disre- 
gard for regul obstructions on the 
free land. Any mri would do the 
like rather than walk around a 
fence, and regul met the like with 
outrage; but it was the mri way, and 
in this mri would not oblige the 
masters. 

Bloody-handed savage, he had 
heard one of the regul younglings 
call him in the town. 

But regul built fences and made 
machines that scarred the earth, and 
tried to divide up space itself into 
territories and limits and parcels to 
be traded like foodstuffs and metals 
and bolts of cloth. It was ludicrous 
in his eyes. 

He walked amid the great tangle 
of abandoned equipage and skeletal 
braces and vehicles. It was as he 
had foreseen: a vast graveyard of 
vehicles and machines, a clot of 
metal so tightly jammed together 
that he had to detour around the 
whole of it, a heap of vehicles and 

94 



sleds and aircraft indiscriminately 
mixed as if some giant hand had 
piled them there — these the vehicles 
that had ferried the inhabitants of all 
the settlements the regul had ruled. 

And there, there a great burned 
area with a tower in charred and 
jagged outline against the port 
lights, an angular tangle of braces 
and more goods that the regul had 
cast aside as waste. Storm- 
shattered, burned; The damage at the 
port had then been very extensive. 
He looked about him as he walked, 
taking inventory of things he had 
once seen whole and saw now dam- 
aged, and he began to see reason 
for the regul’s distressed behaviors. 

Hazan stood in a vast assemblage 
of gantries and hoses and fragile ex- 
tensions, and about that ship, too, 
he saw evident damage. She was 
aglow with lights, acrawl with black 
figures that labored on her like car- 
rion insects; and a steady line of 
vehicles moved toward her, bearing 
goods, no doubt, for loading and 
for repairs. 

He passed this area, careful of 
being seen, and rounded the shape 
of Hazan. There, a tower before 
him, stood A banal once more, 
looming against the sky with only 
one light brought to bear upon her 
hull. 

He drew near and saw that she 
was old, her metal pitted as with 
acids, her markings seared almost 
beyond recognition. Long scars 
marked where shields must have 
failed. 

He voice-hailed them, conscious 
of the nearness of regul sentries, of 
a sled that had already started his 
way. 

''Ahanal!" he cried. “Open your 

GALAXY 




hatch!” 

But either they were not prepared 
to hear or they had reason to be un- 
easy of the regul; and there was no 
response from Ahanal. He saw the 
sled veer sharply, coming to a halt 
near him, and a youngling regul 
opened the sidescreen to speak to 
him. 

“Mri,” said the regul, “you are 
not permitted.” 

“Is this the order of the bai?” he 
asked. 

“Go away,” the regul insisted. 
“Kesrithi mri, go away.” 

There was a sudden crash of 
metal; The hatch had opened. He 
ignored the regul to glance upward 
at the ship, from which a ramp 
began to extend. He walked toward 
it, disregarding the regul. 

The sled hummed behind him. 
He moved, narrowly missed. The 
fender clipped the side of his leg, 
and the sled circled in front of him, 
blocking his path. 

The window was still open. The 
youngling regul was breathing hard, 
his great nostrils opening and shut- 
ting in extreme agitation. 

“Go back,” it hissed. 

Niun began to step around the 
sled but it lurched forward and he 
rolled on his shoulder across its low 
nose, landed on the other side and 
ran, shamed and frightened. Mri 
were watching from the ramp, 
doubtless outraged at his discomfi- 
ture. His legs were weak under him 
with terror for what he had done, a 
thing that no mri had ever done — he 
had defied the masters directly. 

But he was the she’pan’s mes- 
senger and if he delayed to argue 
with the youngling, there would be 
regul authority involved, with or- 

THE FADED SUN 



ders to obey or disobey, with a 
crisis for the she ’pan that a mere 
kel’en could not resolve without di- 
rect violence. 

He ran, hit the echoing solidity of 
the ramp and raced up it as quickly 
as he could to meet the mri of the 
ship, but they were already fading 
back into the ship and did not stay 
for him. He heard, and felt, the 
ramp taking up behind him, shorten- 
ing its length as he overtook the last 
of them. Lights came on then, 
blinding; doors shut, sealing them 
safely inside. 

Ten kel’ein: Husbands, by their 
age and dignity. There was cold 
light, and air piercing in its sterility 
after the air of Kesrith. The final 
seal of the lock closed between 
them and the outside, the ramp in 
place. There was silence. 

“Sirs,” he remembered to say 
and stopped looking at them — with 
their many j'tai and their grim, 
strangers’ manner — long enough to 
touch his brow and pay proper re- 
spect. He looked up again and un- 
veiled, a courtesy which they grudg- 
ingly returned. 

“I am Niun s’lntel Zain-Abrin,” 
he said in the high language, as all 
mri used in formatlities. “I bear 
service to Intel, she’pan of Edun 
Kesrithun.” 

“I am Sune s’Hara Sune-Lir,” 
said the eldest of them, an old man 
whose mane grayed at the temples 
and who looked to be of the age of 
Pasev or Eddan; but his fellows 
were younger, more powerful- 
looking men. “Does the she’pan 
Intel fare well?” 

“The edun is safe.” 

“Does the she’pan intend to 
come in person?” 



95 




“As to that, sir, not until I return 
with the word of your she’pan.” 

Niun understood somewhat their 
attitude, that of men who loved and 
defended their own, men who must 
yield to she ’pan Intel, she who must 
in turn yield them also. It was natu- 
ral that they look on Intel’s mes- 
senger with resentment. 

“We will take you to her,’’ said 
Sune s’Hara with formal grace. 
“Come.” And, with better cour- 
tesy: “You are not injured?” 

“No, sir,” he said, and then re- 
membered with a sudden flush that 
it was not proper for him to defer to 
this man, that he was a messenger 
and, more than that, he betrayed 
himself for a very young kel’en, 
and inexperienced in his authority. 

“Regul and mri are not at ease in 
Kesrith,” he added, covering his 
confusion. “There have been words 
passed.” 

“We were met with weapons,” 
Sune said. “But there were no 
casualties.” 

Niun walked with them, passing 
through corridors of metal, halls de- 
signed for regul. He saw kel’ein 
and he saw kel’e’ein, veiled and 
youthful as he, and his pulse 
quickened — he thought them glori- 
ous and beautiful, and, tried not to 
stare, although he knew that their 
eyes were taking close account of 
him, a stranger among them. Some 
unveiled in brotherly welcome when 
he met them, and a great company 
of them went through the corridors 
to the mainroom, to that center of 
the ship that was now the hall of a 
she ’pan. 

She was middle-aged. He went 
and bowed his head under her hands 
and then looked up at her, vaguely 

96 



disturbed to be greeted by a she ’pan 
not in the familiar earthen closeness 
of a tower but in this metal place, 
and to be greeting a she ’pan who 
was not kin, whose emblem on her 
white, blue-edged robes was that of 
a star, not the hand-emblem of 
Edun Kesrithun. 

She was a stranger, one who 
must die, who must choose to die, 
or whose champion he must defeat 
should she challenge; and he 
prayed silently to all the Gods that 
she would be brave and gracious 
and forego challenge. 

Her eyes were hard and she ex- 
isted in light harsh enough to hurt; 
and the world that surrounded her 
was cold and metal. Many, many of 
the ship-folk surrounded them now, 
their she ’pan, their beloved Mother, 
and not his: he an intruder, a threat 
to her life. 

They saw a she’pan’s messenger, 
but one innocent of ftai won in 
battles — a mere youth, unscarred, 
untried, and vulnerable to chal- 
lenge. 

He felt her eyes go up and down 
him, reckoning this, reckoning his 
world and those who had sent him. 
And beyond her, about her, he saw 
gold-robed sen’ein; and black-robed 
kel’ein; and shyly o^tserving from 
the recesses of the further hall, he 
saw kath’ein, blue-robed, veilless 
and gentle and frightened. 

And about them, within the other 
corridors, were row on row of 
hammocks slung like the nestings of 
Kesrith ’s spiders, threads of white 
and webbings that laced the room 
and the sides of the corridors. He 
was overwhelmed by the number of 
those that crowded close; and yet it 
struck him suddenly that here was 

GALAXY 




his whole species, all reduced to 
this little ship, and under the pres- 
ent command of this woman. 

“Messenger,” she said, “1 am 
Esain of Edun Elagun. How fares 
Intel?” 

Her voice was kinder than her 
face, and shot through him like sun 
after night. His heart melted toward 
her, that she could speak kindly to- 
ward him and toward Intel. 

“She’pan,” he said, “Intel is 
well enough.” 

He put kindness into his voice, 
and yet she understood, for a 
shadow passed through her eyes, 
and fear; but she was a great lady, 
and did not flinch. 

“What does Intel wish to tell 
me?” asked Esain. 

“She’pan,” he said, “she gave 
me welcome for you, and sent me 
to listen to you first of all.” 

She nodded slightly, and with a 
move of her hand bade council at- 
tend her. Kel’anth and sen’anth and 
kath’anth came and sat by her; and 
the fen’ein, her Husbands of the 
Kel; and the body of the Sen; and 
while these took their places, the 
others withdrew, and doors were 
closed. 

He remained kneeling before her 
and carefully removed his zaidhe 
and laid that before him; and on it 
he laid the av-kel. the Kel-sword 
that was Sirain’s lending, sheathed 
before him, hilt toward her, a token 
of peace. His hands he folded in his 
lap. Her kel’ein did the same, hilts 
toward him, the stranger in their 
midst, the visitor admitted to coun- 
cil. 

“We send greetings to Intel,” 
said Esain quietly. “Of her wisdom 
long ago was Ahanal reserved for 

98 



the People, and of her wisdom was 
Ahanal freed to come. She placed 
such a burden on the Kel, refusing 
regul assistance, that there was no 
honorable choice. Honor outweigh- 
ed honor. This was wisely done. 
All aboard understand and are grate- 
ful that it was done in time, for noth- 
ing else could have compelled us 
from the front. Is it true, as we 
guess, that she intends to leave 
regul service?” 

“Her words: We have almost left 
regul service. Your fen’ein and the 
kel’anth saw the result of it when I 
came toward the ship.” 

She looked at the kel’anth. He 
gave agreement with a gesture. 

“I have seen a thing I have never 
seen,” the old man said. “A regul 
attacked this messenger — not with 
hands, to be sure, but with his 
machine. These regul are desper- 
ate.” 

“And the edun?” the she’pan 
asked, her brow crossed with a 
frown. “How fares the Edun of the 
People, with the regul in such a 
mood?” 

“Presently secure,” he said, 
and — for he saw the real question 
burning in her, that she would hesi- 
tate to ask a mere kel’en — 
“she’pan, the Forbidden is in her 
keeping; and the regul are busy with 
the damage the weather has done 
them. Humans are close, and the 
regul fear delays that could hold 
them grounded. I think that what 
happened out there was the act of a 
youngling without clear orders.” 

“Yet,” said the she’pan, “what 
if we were to leave the ship in a 
body?” 

“We are mri,” said Niun with 
supreme confidence, “and regul 

GALAXY 




would give way before us, and they 
would dare do nothing.” 

‘‘Did you so judge,” asked the 
she’pan, ‘‘of that youngling that at- 
tempted your life?” 

Heat mounted in his face. 
‘‘She’pan,” he said, made aware of 
his youth and his inexperience, ‘‘I 
do not think that was a serious 
threat.” 

She considered, and looked at the 
Sen and the others, and finally 
sighed and frowned. ‘‘I bear too 
great a charge here to risk it. We 
will wait until Intel has made her 
decision. We have force here at her 
call; I will send it or reserve it as 
she says. And, messenger, assure 
her that I will respect her claim on 
the People.” 

He was shocked and relieved at 
once, and he bowed very low to 
her, hearing the murmur of grief 
run the length and breadth of the 
room. He could hardly bear to meet 
her eyes again, but found them gen- 
tle and unaccusing. 

‘‘I will tell her,” he said, recov- 
ering the courtesies trained into 
him, part of blood and flesh and 
bone, ‘‘that the she’pan of Edun 
Elagun is a grand and brave lady, 
and that she has earned great honor 
of all the People.” 

‘‘Tell her,” she said softly, ‘‘that 
I wish her well with my children.” 

Many veiled themselves, hearing 
her, and he found his own eyes sting- 
ing. 

‘‘I will tell her,” he said. 

‘‘Will you, messenger, stay the 
night with us?” 

He thought of it, for it was a 
walk of the rest of the night to re- 
turn again to the edun, and likely a 
great deal of sleep lost thereafter, 

THE FADED SUN 



once Intel had begun to give orders; 
but he thought of the regul that had 
crossed his path, and the weather, 
and the uncertainties that hemmed 
him about. 

‘‘She’pan,” he said, ‘‘my duty is 
to go back now; it is best now, be- 
fore the regul have time to take 
long consultations.” 

“Yes,” she said, “that would be 
the wisest thing. Go,. then.” 

And she, when he had gathered 
up the av-kel and replaced the 
zaidhe and come to touch her hand 
and do heartfelt courtesy, gave into 
his hand a ring of true gold, at 
which his heart clenched in pain; 
for it was a gracious, brave thing to 
do, to give a service-gift as if he 
had well-pleased her. From her own 
finger she drew it and pressed it 
into his hand, and he bowed and 
kissed her fingers before he stood 
and took his leave. He laced the 
ring into one of the thongs of his 
honors, to braid it in properly later, 
and bowed her farewell. 

“Safe passage, kel’en,” she said. 

He should wish her long life, and 
he could not; he thought instead of 
that parting of kel’ein: “Honors and 
good attend,” he said, and she ac- 
cepted his courtesy with grace. 

The Kel veiled and he did so 
likewise, grateful for that privacy as 
they led him back to the doors, to 
let him out into the dark. 

He heard the mournful protest of 
a confined dus, attuned to the mood 
of the Kel it served; and with that 
he entered the lock and the lights 
were extinguished, to make them 
less a target. 

For a moment the darkness was 
complete. The the opening ramp 
and the double doors let the light 



99 




in, the floodlights on the field, and 
the acrid, wet wind touched them. 

They did not speak as he left. 
There had not been a word passed. 
It was due to their Lady Mother’s 
courage that he and one of hers 
would not shed blood in the passing 
of power; but it was settled. 

When there was only one she ’pan 
on Kesrith, there would be time for 
courtesies, for welcome among 
them. 

He did not look back as he 
started down the ramp. 

XVI 

Niun had expected trouble at the 
bottom of the ramp, but there was 
none, neither regul guard nor the 
assistance that such guard might 
have summoned. He questioned 
nothing of his good fortune but 
ducked his head and ran, soft-soled 
boots muffling his steps across the 
pad. 

He threaded again the maze of 
machinery, and there, there were 
the regul he had feared, a flare of 
headlights beyond the fence. He 
caught his breath and paused half a 
step to survey the situation, then 
slipped to the shadows and changed 
course, reckoning that there was no 
need to use the same access twice. 
He burned through the wire fence, 
kicked the wire aside and ran for it, 
his lungs hurting in the thin air. 
Somewhere a dus keened, mournful 
over the rumble of machinery that 
prowled the dark. 

He reached the edge of the apron 
and bolted for the sand, startled and 
shocked as a beam of light hit the 
ground across his path. He gasped 
for air and changed direction, darted 

100 



around the bending of a dune and 
ran with all the strength he had re- 
maininjg. 

After a moment he reckoned him- 
self relatively safe, enough to catch 
his breath again. Regul could not 
outrace him and the noisy machines 
could not surprise him. He 
smothered a cough, natural result of 
his rash burst of speed, and began 
uneasily to take account of this new 
state of affairs, that regul had, with 
premeditation, sought not to catch 
him, but to kill him. 

He lay against the side of the 
dune, his hand pressed to his aching 
side, trying to keep his breathing 
normal, and heard something 
stir — dus, he thought, for he knew 
that the hills were full of them this 
night, and did regul come out very 
far into the wild after him, they 
would meet a welcome they would 
not like. The dusei of the edun 
would do no harm to regul; but 
these were not tame ones and the 
regul might not reckon that dif- 
ference until it was too late to mat- 
ter. 

He gathered himself up and 
started to move forward, hearing at 
the same time a rapid sound of 
footsteps, mri-light and mri-quick, 
following his track through the 
dunes. He surmised it for one of 
Esain’s kel’ein, on some desperate 
second thought; and for that reason 
he froze, hissed at the shadow a 
warning as it fronted him, respectful 
of it, another kel’en. 

But no kel’en. 

Half a breath they faced each 
other, human and mri; and in that 
half-breath Niun whipped up his 
pistol and the human dived desper- 
ately to retreat, vain hope in that 

GALAXY 




narrow, dune -constricted area. 

And in the next instant another 
thought flashed into Niun’s mind: A 
dead human could provide little an- 
swer to questions. He did not fire. 
He followed; and when he overtook 
the human, he motioned with his 
hand, come, come. The human, 
casting desperate looks behind and 
at him, was a fair target should 
Niun fire. 

And the human chose regul and 
whirled and ran. 

A creature that had no business 
on Kesrith. 

Niun thumbed the safety on, 
bolstered the pistol and chose a new 
direction, a direction the regul could 
not manage, up over the arm of a 
dune; and he cast himself fiat, 
scanning the scene to know what 
manner of ambush he had sprung. 
Indeed the human had run directly 
into regul hands, in the person of 
one daring youngling who now had 
him cornered against a ridge the 
human could easily climb if he had 
the wit to think of it; and the human 
did think of it and scrambled for his 
life, fighting to gain the top. But 
the regul laid hold on his ankle and 
dragged him back again, inexora- 
bly. 

They noticed nothing else. Niun 
retreated behind the ridge, raced a 
distance, went over and down in a 
plummeting slide, hit the solid mass 
of the regul and staggered it; and 
when it rounded on him clumsily, 
making the mistake of aiming a 
weapon at a kel’en, it was the 
youngling’s final mistake. Niun did 
not think about the flash of the as-ei 
that left his hand and buried them- 
selves in the youngling’s throat and 
chest; they were sped before the 

the faded sun 



thought had time to become pur- 
pose. 

And the human, scrambling to 
reach the regul’s gun — Niun hit him 
body to body, and had there been a 
knife in Niun’s intentions, the 
human would have been dead in the 
same instant. 

No mean adversary, the human. 
Niun found himself countered, 
barehanded, in his attempt to seize 
hold of him; but the human was al- 
ready done, bleeding from the nos- 
trils, his bubbling breath hoarse in 
Niun’s ear. He broke the human’s 
hold; his arm found the human’s 
throat and snapped his head back 
with a crack of meeting teeth. 

Not yet did the human fall, but a 
quick blow to the belly and a sec- 
ond snap to the head toppled him, 
writhing, to the sands; and Niun hit 
him yet another time, ending his 
struggles. 

A strip from his belt secured the 
human; and he recovered his as-ei 
and sheathed them quickly, hearing 
the slow grinding of machinery ad- 
vancing on this place, and the both 
of them having made tracks even 
the night-blind regul could read. 

The human was showing signs of 
consciousness; Niun gave him a jerk 
by the elbow and dragged him until 
the man tried to respond to the dis- 
comfort. Then he gave him slack to 
drag his legs under him and to try 
to stand. 

“Quiet,” Niun hissed at him. 

And if the human thought to cry 
out, he thought better of it with the 
edge of the av-tlen near his face; he 
struggled up to his knees and, with 
Niun’s help, to his feet, and went 
silently where he was compelled to 
go. He coughed and tried to 



101 




smother even that sound. His face 
was a mask of blood and sand in 
the dim light that shone from the 
field, and he walked as if his knees 
were about to fail him. 

Onto the edge of the flats they 
went, and slow, ominous shadows 
of dusei stood watching them from 
the dunes, but gave them no threat. 
There was no sound of pursuit be- 
hind them. Perhaps the regul were 
still in shock, that a kel’en had 
raised hand against the masters. 

Niun knew the enormity of what 
he had done; he had had time to re- 
alize it clearly. He knew the regul, 
that they would take time to consult 
with authority, and beyond that he 
could not calculate. No mri had 
ever raised hand to his sworn au- 
thority. No regul had ever had to 
deal with a mri who had done so. 

He seized the human’s elbow and 
hurried him, though he stumbled at 
times, though he misstepped and 
cried out in shock when a crust 
broke with him and he hit boiling 
water. They went well onto the 
flats, where neither regul nor regul 
vehicles could go, into the sulphuric 
steam of geysers that veiled them 
from sight. By now the human 
coughed and spat, bleeding in his 
upper air passages if not in his 
lungs, Niun reckoned. 

In consideration of that he found 
a place and thrust the human down 
against the shoulder of a clay bank 
and let him catch his breath, him- 
self glad enough of a chance to do 
the same. 

For a moment the human lay face 
down, body heaving with the effort 
not to cough, correctly assuming 
that this would not be tolerated. 
Then the spasms eased and he lay 

102 



still on his side, exhausted, staring 
at him. 

Unarmed. Niun took that curious 
fact into account, wondering what 
possessed the humans; or what had 
befallen this one, that he had lost 
his weapons. The human simply 
gazed at him, eyes running tears 
through sand: no emotion, no ex- 
pression other than one of exhaus- 
tion and misery. Unprotected he had 
come into Kesrith’s unfriendly envi- 
ronment; unwisely he had run, risk- 
ing damage to his tissues. 

And he had run from regul, with 
whom his people had made a treaty. 

“I am Sten Duncan,” the human 
whispered at last in his own tongue. 
‘T am with the human envoy. 
Kel’en, we are here under agree- 
ment.” 

Niun considered that volunteered 
information: Human envoy; human 
envoy — the words rolled around in 
his mind with the ominous tone of 
betrayal. 

‘‘I am kel Niun,” he said, be- 
cause this being had offered him a 
name. 

“Are you from the edun?” 

Niun did not answer, there seem- 
ing no need. 

‘‘That is where you’re taking me, 
isn’t it?” And when again the 
human had no answer of him, he 
seemed disquieted. ‘‘I’ll go there of 
my own accord. You don’t need to 
use force.” 

Niun considered this offer. Hu- 
mans lied. He knew this. He had 
not had experience to be able to 
judge this one. 

‘‘I will not set you free,” he 
said. 

It was not the custom of humans 
to veil themselves; but Niun was 

GALAXY 




sorry, all the same, that he had so 
dealt with a human kel’en, taking 
dignity from him — if he were 
kel’en. Niun judged that he was: He 
had handled himself well. 

“We will go to the edun,” he 
said to Duncan. He stood up and 
drew Duncan to his feet; he did not 
help him overmuch for this was not 
a brother; but he waited until he 
was sure he had his balance. The 
man was hurt. He marked that the 
human’s steps were uneven and un- 
certain, and that he walked without 
knowledge of the land, blind to its 
dangers. 

And deaf. 

Niun heard the aircraft lift from 
the port, heard it turn in their direc- 
tion; and the human had not even 
looked until Niun jerked him about 
to see it. He stood stupidly gazing 
toward the port, malicious or 
dullwitted, Niun did not pause to 
know,. He seized the human and 
pulled him toward the boiling wa- 
ters of Jieca, that curled steam into 
the night; and by a clay ridge, their 
lungs choked with sulphur, they 
look hiding. 

Regul engines passed. Lights 
swept the flats and lit plumes of 
steam, fruitlessly seeking move- 
ment. Heat-sensors were of limited 
usefulness here on the volcanic 
flats. The boiling springs and seeth- 
ing mud made regul science of little 
value in tracking them. 

“Kel’en,” Duncan said, “which 
one are they looking for? Me, or 
you?’’ 

“How have you offended the re- 
gul?’’ Niun asiced, reckoning it of 
no profit to give information, but of 
some to gain it; and all the while 
the beams of light swept the flats, 

the faded sun 



lighting one plume and then 
another. “Were you a prisoner?’’ 

“Assistant to the human envoy, 
to come — ’’ A burst of fire lit their 
faces and spattered them with boil- 
ing water. They made a single mass 
against it, and as the firing con- 
tinued and the water kept splashing, 
a rumble began in the earth and a 
jet of steam broke near them, en- 
veloping them, uncomfortably hot 
but not beyond bearing. 

“Tsi’mri,’’ Niun cursed under his 
breath, forgetting with what he 
shared shelter; and as the barrage 
repeated itself, he felt the human 
begin trembling, long, sickly shud- 
ders of a being whose strength was 
nearly spent. 

“ — to come ahead of the mis- 
sion,’’ the human resumed 
doggedly, still shaking. “To see 
that everything is as we were prom- 
ised. And I don’t think it — ’’ 

A near burst threw water and 
mud onto them. The human cried 
out, smothered it. 

“How many of you are there?’’ 
Niun asked. 

“Myself . and the envoy. 
Two. We came on Hazan . back 
there.’’ 

Niun grasped Duncan’s collar and 
turned his face to the light that 
glared from the searching beams. 
He saw nothing to tell him whether 
this was truth or lie. This was a 
young man, he saw, now that the 
face was washed clear by the mois- 
ture that enveloped both of them — a 
kel’en of the humans; Niun shrank 
from applying that honorable title to 
aliens, but he knew no other that 
applied to this one. 

“There was a kel’en on Hazan,” 
said Niun, “who died there.’’ 



103 




For the first time something 
seemed to strike though to the hu- 
man: there was a hesitancy to an- 
swer. “I saw him. Once. I didn’t 
know he was dead.” 

Niun thrust him back, for the 
moment blind with anger. Tsi’mri, 
he reminded himself, and enemy, 
but less so now than the regul. / 
saw him. I didn’t know he was 
dead. 

Niun turned his face aside and 
stared bleakly at the rolling steam 
and the lights that criss-crossed the 
flats, searching. 

Forgive us, Medai, he thought. 
Our perceptions were too dull, our 
minds too accustomed to serving 
regul, that we could have under- 
stood the message you tried to send 
us. 

He forced himself to look at the 
hateful human face, that had not the 
decency of concealment — at the 
nakedness of this being that had, 
unknowingly perhaps, destroyed a 
kel’en of the People. Animal, he 
thought; tsi’mri animal. The 
regul-mri treaty was broken from 
the moment this creature had set 
foot on Kesrith; and that had been 
many, many days ago. For this long 
the People had been free, and had 
not known it. 

“There is no more war,” Duncan 
protested, and Niun’s arm tensed, 
and he would have hit the human; 
but it was not honorable. 

“Why do you suppose that the 
regul are hunting us?” he asked of 
Duncan, casting back his own ques- 
tion. “Do you not understand, hu- 
man, that you have made a great 
mistake in leaving //aza«?” 

“I am going with you,” the 
human said, the first semblance of 



dignity he had shown, “to talk to 
your elders, to make them under- 
stand that I had better be returned to 
my people.” 

“Ah,” said Niun, almost moved 
to scornful mirth. “But we are mri, 
not regul. We care nothing for your 
bargains with the regul, much good 
they have done you.” 

The human remained still and 
considered Niun’s words, and there 
was no yielding at the implied 
threat. “I see,” he said. And a 
moment later, in a quiet, restrained 
tone: “I left the envoy down there 
in town — an old man, alone with 
regul, with this going on. I have to 
get back to him.” 

Niun considered this, understand- 
ing. It was loyalty to this sen’anth 
for which he endured this patiently. 
He gave respect to the human for 
that, touched his heart in token of 
it. 

“I will deliver you alive to the 
edun,” he said, and felt compelled 
to add: “It is not our habit to take 
prisoners.” 

“We have learned that,” Duncan 
said. 

Therefore they understood each 
other as much as might be. Niun 
considered the flats before them, reck- 
oning what might already have 
been done to familiar ground by the 
bombardment, what obstacles might 
have been created on the unstable 
land, where they might next find 
safest shelter should the regul sweep 
back sooner than anticipated. 

It was well that he and the human 
had come to an understanding, that 
Duncan considered that his best 
chance and most honorable course 
was to cooperate for the moment. A 
man unburdened could make the 



104 



GALAXY 




journey by morning, all things in 
his favor; but not with regul blast- 
ing away the route about them; and 
day would show them up clearly, 
making it next evening before they 
could reach the edun if things kept 
on as they were. 

A sick dread gathered in Niun’s 
stomach; for very little even so, he 
would have killed the human and 
run for the edun at all speed. 

He cursed himself for his soft- 
ness, that had put him to such a 
choice between butchery and stupid- 
ity; and he gripped the human’s 
arm. 

“Listen to me. If you do not 
keep my pace, I cannot keep you; 
and if I cannot keep you, I will kill 
you. It is also,” he added, “very 
likely that the regul will kill you to 
keep you from your superior.” 

He slipped from cover then and 
drew the human with him by the 
arm, and Duncan came without re- 
sisting. 

But the regul craft, lacing the 
area, swept back, and they made 
only a few strides before it was 
necessary to hurl themselves into 
other cover. 

The barrage began again, deafen- 
ing, spattering them with boiling 
water and gouts of mud. 

The edun would be aware of this. 
They were doubtless doing some- 
thing; perhaps — Niun thought — 
Duncan’s sen’anth likewise knew 
and was doing something; and there 
was also Ahanal, yet independent of 
Intel. 

He understood the human’s help- 
less terror. Of all who had px)wer 
on Kesrith, they two had least; and 
the regul, who did not fight, had 
taken up arms, impelled by malice 

THE FADED SUN 



or fear or whatever driving motive 
could span the gap between coward- 
ice and self-interest. 

XVII 

There was firing, a sound unmis- 
takable to a man who had lived a 
great part of his life in war. 

Stavros turned his sled to view 
the window and saw the lights of 
aircraft circling under the clouds. 
His fingers sought the console 
keyboard, adjusted screens with 
what had grown to be some exper- 
tise; simple controls they were, a 
phenomenal series of coded signals, 
each memorized. The regul had 
provided him the codings with an 
attitude of smug contempt. “Learn 
it” they had challenged him with 
that look of theirs that classed be- 
ings of short memory with sub- 
sapients. 

Stavros was not typical in this re- 
gard, had never been typical, not 
from his boyhood on remote 
Kiluwa, to his attachment to the 
XenBureau, to his directorate on 
Halley during first contact. He 
found nothing difficult in languages, 
nor in alien customs, nor in recog- 
nizing provincial short-sightedness, 
whether offered by humans or by 
others. 

He was Kiluwan by allegiance, a 
distinction the regul and most hu- 
mans did not appreicate. Kiluwa — 
remote, first-stage colony, popu- 
lated by religious traditionalists 
among whom writing was a sin and 
education an obsession. He. had 
been bom there a century ago, be- 
fore the peaceful, eccentric colony 
had become a casualty of the mri 
wars. 



105 




A number of Kiluwans had dis- 
tinguished themselves in Service; 
they were gone now, among casual- 
ties of forty years ago, retaliation 
for Nisren. Stavros survived. It was 
characteristic of his Kiluwan up- 
bringing that he should be driven to 
understand the species that had or- 
dered Kiluwa obliterated. Regul had 
done this, not mri. Therefore he 
studied the phenomenon of regul, 
who had minds much like the per- 
fection Kiluwa had sought; and yet 
had destroyed all that Kiluwa had 
built. There was, as the university 
masters had once said, a “rhythm 
of justice” in this, a joining of can- 
celing forces. Now a Kiluwan came 
to displace regul and the rhythm 
continued, binding them both. 

He learned regul ways, looking 
for resolution to this; he observed 
meanness and coldness and self- 
seeking ambition, as well as rever- 
ence for mind. He had come from 
fear of regul to a yearning over 
them, with not a little of sorrow for 
Kiluwa, whose dream in the flesh 
had come to this flawed reality; and 
there were truths beyond what he 
had been able to grasp, vices and 
virtues inherent in the biology of 
regul. He saw these and began to 
understand, at least, constraints of 
species-perpetuation and population- 
control; division into hive-structures, 
breeking-elders and younglings, the 
docha that answered roughly to na- 
tions; he acquired suspicions about the 
value of treaties that bound, and yet 
did not bind, docha that had not been 
party to the agreement. 

They had contracted with Holn 
and suddenly found themselves 
dealing instead with Alagn; and 

106 



Alagn honored the agreement. 

Outwardly. 

It had come to the point of truth. 
He had sat the long hours through 
the day and into dark and covered 
for Duncan’s absence and commit- 
ted every deception but the outright 
lie which the regul would not for- 
give. In the hours’ passage he had 
grown more and more certain, first 
that Duncan had found something 
amiss, or he would have returned 
quickly, surely by the time dark 
gave him concealment; and then, 
when the fall of night did not bring 
him back, he became well sure that 
something amiss had found Duncan. 

The pretences with the regul be- 
came charade bitterly difficult to 
maintain. Regul could murder the 
SurTac and blandly fail to mention 
it with the morning’s reports. And 
there was not a human going to 
land on Kesrith without Stavros’ 
clearance: not in peace, at least, not 
without removing all possible re- 
sistance. 

The regul surely understood this. 

He sat and listened to the firing, 
knowing while it continued that 
likely Duncan was still alive. 

He had been a shaper of policy in 
his day, had settled a new world 
and founded a university; he had 
plotted strategies of diplomacy and 
war, had disposed of lives in 
numbers in which ships and crews 
were reckoned expendable, in which 
the likes of Sten Duncan perished in 
their hundreds. 

But now he heard the firing, and 
clenched his right hand and 
agonized in a desperate attempt to 
move his unwilling left arm with 
any strength at all. He was held to 
the sled, constrained to be patient. 

GALAXY 




There was new catastrophe at the 
port. There were hints in regul 
communications, into which he had 
intruded, that a ship had come 
down and that it was not friendly to 
regul. 

Human, rival regul, or mri? He 
could guess well enough what had 
drawn Duncan to overstay his leave. 
Create no incident, he had told the 
lad, knowing then that there was lit- 
tle Duncan could do to create any- 
thing: I waited to happen, all about 
them. He had felt it increasingly, in 
the silences of the regul, in the ten- 
sion in the atmosphere of the Nom. 

The regul were trying something 
illicit. Human interests were en- 
dangered. And there would be no 
word of approval going from him to 
the human mission when it arrived, 
no matter what the coercion. 

If it had not already arrived. 

Stavros was not a man of precipi- 
tate action. He thought; and when 
he had concluded that chances were 
even, he was capable of rashness. 
He found no need to cooperate fur- 
ther with hosts that would either kill 
them or not dare to kill them. It 
was time to call, their bluff. 

He fingered the console, whipped 
the sled about and opened doors. 
He guided the machine through 
Duncan’s apartment, and with a 
smooth, well-practiced series of 
commands, and a turn to the right, 
locked it into the tracking that ran 
the corridors. 

Youngling regul saw him and 
gaped, .jabbering protests which he 
ignored. He knew his commands, 
calculated the appropriate moves, 
locked into a turn and whisked into 
the side of the building that faced 
the port. There he stopped and 

THE FADED SUN 



keyed into the window controls, 
brightening windows, commanding 
storm shields withdrawn. 

A new ship, indeed. 

And lights glared over the coun- 
tryside, flaring garishly in the haze 
of smoke and steam, aircraft lacing 
the ground with their beams. 

Ah, Duncan, he thought with 
great regret. 

A youngling puffed up to him. 
“Elder human,” it said, “we re- 
gret, but — ” 

Bai Hulagh. Where? he de- 
manded via the screen, a demand 
that visibly took the youngling 
aback. Youngling, find me the bai. 

It fled, at least with what dis- 
patch a regul could manage, and 
Stavros whipped the sled about and 
took it to the left, engaged a track 
and shot down the ramp, whisked 
around the comer and entered the 
first level of the Nom, from which 
he and Duncan had been carefully 
excluded. 

Here he disengaged and went on 
manual, edging throught the gab- 
bling crowd of younglings. Mri, he 
heard, and mri ship\ and alert. 

And they made way for him until 
one noticed that the sled, the sym- 
bol to them of adult authority, con- 
tained a human. 

“Go back,” they wished him. 
“Go back, elder.” 

Bai Hulagh. Now, he insisted, 
and would not move, and there was 
nothing they dared do about it. 

When they began to murmur to- 
gether in great confusion, he di- 
rected the sled through them and 
toured the ground floor in leisurely 
fashion, the air vibrating with the 
attack out on the flats and the build- 
ing vibrating to the shocks. Men- 



107 




tally he noted where doors were lo- 
cated, and where accesses were, and 
where it was possible to come and 
go with the sled. 

A message flashed on his re- 
ceiver. 

It was Hulagh’s signal. Hulagh’s 
face followed. “Esteemed elder 
human,” Hulagh said, “please re- 
turn at once to your quarters.” 

I am unable to believe that they 
are secure, Stavros spelled out pa- 
tiently. Where is my assistant? 

“He has disregaid our advice and 
is now involved in a situation,” 
said Hulagh with remarkable can- 
dor, such that Stavros’ hopes ab- 
ruptly lifted. “Mri have landed, I 
regret to admit, honorable represen- 
tative. These mri are outlaws, bent 
on making trouble. Your youngling 
is somewhere in the midst of things, 
quite contrary to our warnings. 
Please make our task easier by re- 
turning to the safety of your quar- 
ters.” 

I refuse. Stavros keyed a win- 
dow clear. I will observe from the 
utmost. He would not, voluntarily, 
have surrendered his view through 
the windows, not trusting the lim- 
ited one provided by regul serv- 
ices; but the barrage was intense 
and the windows rattled ominously, 
and he began to believe the bai’s 
warning. The regul building was 
undergoing repeated shocks. He 
knew the bai’s warning for an hon- 
est one. 

It only remained to question what 
was happening to occasion the fir- 
ing. The regul, he reminded him- 
self, closing the storm shield, did 
not lie. 

Therefore it was true that mri had 
landed and that Sten Duncan was 

108 



somewhere out on the flats, but one 
never assumed anything with the 
regul. 

Then the floor shook, and sirens 
wailed throughout the building. 

Stavros locked the sled onto a 
track and whisked himself back to 
the main lobby, where a group of 
younglings frantically waved at 
him, trying to offer him instructions 
all at once. 

“Shelter, reverence, shelter!” 
they said, pointing at another hall, a 
ramp leading down. He considered 
and thought that it might at the 
moment be wise to listen. 



XVIII 

Duncan was spent, a burden, a 
hazard. Niun set hands on him and 
pushed him downslope, to shelter 
under an overiiang by a boiling 
pool, forcing him further under as 
he wedged his own body after. 

It was scantly in time. A near 
burst of fire hissed across the water 
and crumbled rock near them: blind 
fire, not aimed. The searching 
beams continued, lacing the area. 
Niun saw the face of Duncan in the 
reflected light, haggard and 
swollen-eyed — his vision unpro- 
tected by the membrane that hazed 
Niun’s own when the smoke grew 
thick. Duncan’s upper lip showed a 
black trail that was blood in the dim 
light. It poured steadily, a nuisance 
that had become more than nui- 
sance. The human heaved with a 
bubbling cough and tried to stifle it. 

The reek in the air from the fir- 
ing, and from the natural steam and 

GALAXY 




sulphur, was thick and choking. 
Niun twisted in the narrow con- 
fines, fastidious about touching the 
bleeding and sweating human, and 
at last, exhausted, abandoned 
niceties in such close quarters. They 
lay in a space likely to become their 
tomb should another shot crumble 
the ledge over them, mri and human 
bones commingled for future pos- 
sessors of Kesrith to wonder at. 

This was delirium. The mind 
could not function under such 
pounding shocks as bracketed them 
constantly. Niun found the regul 
amazing in their ineptitude. They 
two should have been dead over and 
over, had the regul had any knowl- 
edge of the land; but the regul had 
not, and were firing blind at a land- 
scape as unknown and alien to them 
as the bottom of the sea. The world 
was lit in constant flares of white 



and red, swirled in mists and steam 
and smoke and clouds of dust, like 
the Hell that humans swore by; that 
of mri was an unending Dark. 

The water splashed, singing and 
bubbling. Niun lowered the visor of 
the zaidhe, he the outermost, shield- 
ing the human with his own body: 
ironic arrangement, chance -chosen, 
one he would have reversed at the 
moment if it were possible. 

An explosion heaved the earth, 
numbed the senses, drove their 
numbed bodies into fresh convul- 
sions of terror. 

And hard upon that a white light 
lit the rocks, grew, ate them, de- 
voured all the world; and a pressure 
unbearable; and Niun knew that 
they were hit, and tried to move to 
roll out into the open before the 
ledge came down. The pressure 
burst over him, and it was red. 





* * * 

. .wind, wind in great force, 
skirling away the smoke and mist, 
causing the red to swirl before his 
membraned, visored eyes. Niun 
moved, became aware that he 
moved, and that he lived. 

And all about was light, sullen 
and ugly red. 

He gathered himself up, and 
turned toward the source of the 
light, and saw the port. 

There was nothing. 

He stood, his legs shuddering be- 
neath him. He thought that he cried 
out, so great was his pain; and he 
shut his eyes, and opened them, try- 
ing to see through the flame, until 
the tears poured down his face. But 
of Ahanal, of Hazan, there was noth- 
ing to be seen. Within the city it- 
self fires blazed, sending smoke 
boiling aloft. 

And even as he watched, an air- 
craft lifted from near the horizon, 
circled for a distance out to sea, and 
came back again, lights blinking 
lazily. 

He followed it with his eyes, the 
aircraft circling, rounding over the 
city, through the smoke, beginning 
to come about toward the hills. 

Toward the edun. 

He wished to turn his face from 
it, knowing, knowing already the 
end. He turned with it, watched, a 
great knot swelling in his throat, 
and his body cold and numb, and 
the center of him utterly alive to 
what began to happen. 

The first tower of the edun, that 
of the Kel, flared in light and went, 
slowly tumbling. The sound reached 
him, a numbing shock, and after 
that came the wind as the towers fell, 



as the whole structure of the edun 
hung suspended and crumbled down 
into ruin. 

And the ship circled, light and 
free, lazily winking in the dark as it 
rose above the smoke and came, in- 
solently, over their heads. 

His pistol was in his hands. He 
turned and lifted it and fired one 
futile burst at those retreating lights, 
none others in the sky. The lights 
blurred in his eyes, the betraying 
membrane, or tears. It flashed and 
cleared, and he fired again. 

And the lights continued on for a 
moment; and a red light blossomed, 
and fragments went spinning in var- 
ious trajectories, ruin upon ruin: pis- 
tol shot, or the turbulence that must 
be surrounding the port. 

It healed nothing. He turned, 
looked again at the edun where not 
even flames remained, and his 
stomach spasmed, a wrench that 
weakened his joints and made him 
dizzy. In that moment he would 
have wished to be without senses, 
to be weak, to fall, to sink down, to 
do anything but continue to stand, 
helpless. 

Dead. Dead, all of them. 

He stood, not knowing whether 
to return to the ruin at the port, to 
go on as he was going, or whether 
there was reason to go, or to do 
anything but sit where he was until 
morning, when the regul would 
come to finish matters. He found no 
limit to what senses could absorb. 
He felt. He was not numb. He only 
wished to be, battered by the wind 
that stole the sound from the night, 
whipping- at his robes, a steady snap 
of cloth that was, here, louder than 
the silence that had fallen over every- 
thing. 



110 



GALAXY 




The People were dead. 

He remained. For survivors there 
were duties, respects, rites that 
wanted doing. He was not of 
Medai’s temperament. 

He slipped the pistol into its hol- 
ster, and clenched his icy hands 
under his arms, and began to reckon 
with the living. 

The Hand of the People, a kel’en; 
and there were his kin to bury, if 
the regul had not done it in killing 
them, and after that there was a war 
the regul perhaps did not expect to 
fight. 

And then he looked toward the 
ledge, and looked on his human 
prisoner, and met his eyes. Here 
also was a man that waited to die, 
that also knew, in small measure, 
what desolation was. 

He could kill the human, and be 
alone thereafter, only himself in a 
vast, vast silence: a tiny act of vio- 
lence after the forces that had 
stormed across the skies of Kesrith 
and ruined the world. 

A tiny and miserable act. Ven- 
geance for a world deserved some- 
thing of equal stature. 

“Get up,” he said quietly, and 
Duncan gathered himself up, shoul- 
der to the rock, staring back at him. 

“We will go up to the hill,” he 
told Duncan. “TTie house of my 
people — I do not think there will be 
more aircraft.” 

Duncan turned and looked, and 
without demur, without question, 
started walking ahead of him. 

The world was changed about 
them. Landmarks that had been on 
the Dus-plain for eons were gone. 
The ground was pocked with scars 
that filled with boiling water. Dun- 
can, leading the way, blind, bound, 

THE FADED SUN 



misstepped and went in up to the 
knee, with nothing more than a 
hoarse sob of shock; and Niun 
seized him and pulled him back, 
steadying him, while the human 
stood and gasped for air. 

He kept a hand on Duncan’s arm 
thereafter, and guided him, knowing 
the way; and preserved the human 
against another time. 

The light came, the red light of 
Arain, foul and murky. Niun looked 
back toward the port, and saw in 
the first light the full truth of what 
he had already known: that nothing 
survived. 

Neither zl/jana/ nor Hazan. 

And when he looked on the hill 
where the Edun of the People had 
stood, it was one with the sand and 
the rocks, as if nothing built by 
hands had ever stood there. 

He saw also in that light what 
prize he had taken, an exhausted 
creature that struggled for every 
upward step, whose face and mouth 
and chest were spattered with blood 
that poured afresh from the nose; in- 
jury or atmosphere, it was uncer- 
tain. The eyes were almost shut, 
streaming tears not of seeming emo- 
tion but of outraged tissues — a face 
naked in the sun, and indecent, and 
more bewildered than evil. He did 
not know why the human kept 
walking at such cost, toward such 
little reward; easier by far the death 
of the land’s violence than what mri 
and human had exchanged for forty 
years. 

But there was a point past which 
there was no thinking, knowing 
only the fact that one lived; and that 
one continued to live whether one 
wanted to or whether one wished 
otherwise. 

m 




He understood such a mind, that 
deep shock which admitted no deci- 
sions. He had never thought that he 
would freeze in crisis; yet he had 
frozen, and the cold of that moment 
when the People died was still 
locked around his mind and his 
heart and seemed never apt to go 
away, not though he had revenge, 
not though he killed every regul that 
breathed, and heaped humanity on 
the desolation as well. 

It was a shock in which their two 
lives were of like value, which was 
nothing at all. 

He pushed the human ahead, 
neither hating now nor pitying, find- 
ing no reason for sparing a human 
when he had the ruin of the edun to 
face for himself. He thought that 
perhaps Duncan sorrowed for his 
own failed duty, which lay lost in 
burning Kesrith; that Duncan also 
mourned failure, as miserable as he. 

But Duncan had all the human 
worlds for kinsmen, knowing that 
they survived; and it was possible to 
hate the human when he let himself 
think on this. He would not return 
this one to his kind: while he lived, 
Duncan would live. While he had to 
face what had become of Kesrith, 
the man Duncan would do the like.

They came to the edun by full 
daylight, untroubled by ships or any 
sign of life from the skies. Down in 
the city there might be such activ- 
ity; it did not extend to them. When 
Niun thought of it, he thought of 
going down and destroying them 
— methodically, joylessly: regul, 

who had no capacity for war. 

Who had finally, in one cowardly 

112 



act, destroyed the People. 

There was irony there that was 
worth bitter laughter. He looked on 
the mound of rubble that had been 
the edun and felt moved to that or to 
tears; and Duncan, no longer forced 
to walk, simply slumped to his 
knees and leaned against the shoul- 
der of the causeway. Niun heard his 
hollow cough and kicked him 
gently, reached down when that was 
not enough to rouse him, and 
caught his arm, pulling him up 
again. 

There was work to be done, at 
least as far as they could try; and he 
was loath to have the ruin touched 
at all by tsi’mri hands, but he had 
not the strength alone. He drew the 
av-tlen and pried loose the knots at 
Duncan’s wrists with its point, care- 
fully unwound the thongs that were 
embedded in Duncan’s swollen 
flesh, and looped the recovered 
leather through its ring on his own 
belts. 

Duncan, trying to work his hands 
to life, looked at the edun, and 
looked at him, a question. Niun 
jerked his head in response and 
Duncan comprehended and began to 
walk. 

They waded through rubble, 
stepped carefully among chunks of 
the walls that were cast down and 
shattered. Here had been simple 
fire, not the radiation that doubtless 
bathed the city and made the place 
uninhabitable. Niun pushed at a 
heap of rubble that blocked their 
way, and saw that beneath that pile 
of heavy stone and fine dust lay at 
least one of the Kel. 

There was no use to move that 
mass, no hope of moving it en- 
tirely. Instead Niun took stones and 

GALAXY 




began to heap them around the visible 
body like a cairn, and Duncan, see- 
ing what he was about, began to 
gather up rocks of the proper size 
and pass them on to him. 

This offended Niun bitterly, that 
the human offered aid rather than 
suffered compulsion; but it was 
needed, and he would not allow the 
human to touch the grave itself. 
And it occurred to him at the same 
moment that Duncan might well 
smash his skull with one of those 
self-same stones the moment he 
turned his back entirely, and that 
this might be what the human was 
preparing, so he kept from turning 
his head while he worked. 

They finished, and from this 
place they went deeper into the ruin 
and into places dark and difficult, 
where heaps of rubble towered 
overhead and sifted dust and peb- 
bles downslope at them. And at the 
core of the deepest ruin was the 
Shrine that he now sought. 

It was all too deeply buried. 

Had it been possible, he would 
have sought out whatever relics he 
could have carried and taken them 
away into the sanctity of Sil’athen, 
where his Tcinsmen also would have 
been buried; but perhaps humans 
would never be curious enough to 
desecrate this place with their 
machines, to sift out the debris and 
leavings of a sfiecies that no longer 
mattered in the universe. 

And here the destruction reached 
that central citadel of himself that 
had yet to feel it; and he trembled 
and his senses almost left him. He 
reached out and sought support, and 
touched the wrong stone, bringing a 
slide that buried the place at their 
feet and brought a sift of powder 

THE FADED SUN 



down on them. The only thing he 
saw clearly was Duncan’s face, ter- 
ror in his eyes as for an instant they 
seemed likely to go under that 
weight of rubble and earth; and then 
the sifting stopped and the place 
grew still. 

A stone shifted somewhere, and 
another; there was another slide, 
and silence, the fall of a few peb- 
bles. 

And in that silence came a thin 
and distant cry. 

Duncan heard it: If not for that 
confirming glance sideward, Niun 
would have thought it illusion. But 
it came from the direction that had 
been Kath, where the deepest 
storerooms were. 

He turned and began to pick his 
way through the ruin, careful, care- 
ful with his life now, and that of 
her who had cried aloud, down 
there in the dark. 

“Melein!” he cried, and paused 
and listened, and that same thin 
sound returned to him. 

He reached the place, estimating 
where it lay, and a wall had fallen 
there, and finer rubble sifted atop it; 
but the steel, regul-made doors had 
held. 

Too well. They were barred by a 
weight that could not be moved, 
that they lacked tools to chip away 
and machines to lift. Niun tore his 
hands on it, and his muscles 
cracked, and Duncan added his 
force, but it would not slide; and at 
last they both sat down, gasping for 
air, coughing. Duncan’s nose 
started pouring blood again. He 
wiped it in a bloody smear and his 
hands were shaking uncontrollably. 

“Is it,’’ Duncan asked, “venti- 
lated down there?’’ 



113 




It was not. It added a fear atop 
the others. 

“Melein,” Niun called out. 
“Melein, do you hear?” 

He heard some manner of an- 
swer, and it was a woman’s voice 
and a young voice, high and thin 
and clear: It was Melein. He reck- 
oned it below them, and tried to 
figure the exact location of it, and 
marked with a heel a spot on the 
floor. 

Then he wrenched a reinforcing 
rod from the ruin and began with 
careful chips to dig — no firing down 
into that sanctuary, no such reck- 
lessness. He dug with that and 
with his fingers, and Duncan saw 
what he was doing and helped him, 
alternating strokes that pounded 
deeper into the cubit-thick flooring, 
and now and again they paused to 
paw away the dust they had made. 

The sun grew hot, and the only 
sound now was the steady chink of 
steel on the cemented earth; and he 
had heard no word from Melein in a 
very long time. He was tormented 
with fear, knowing how small the 
space, below was, how scant the air 
must be; and fear lest the gap they 
were making miss the small space 
where she was sheltered; and fear 
lest the whole floor give way. 

They broke through. Air flooded 
out of that blackness, stale and de- 
pleted and cold. 

“Melein,” he shouted down, and 
had no answer. 

He began to work yet harder, 
ramming chips from the edges of 
the hole, widening it, admitting 
more and more air, sending a shaft 
of sunlight down into that place. 
They exposed steel rods and worked 
in the other direction, where they 

114 



could make a wider hole, and from 
time to time he would call down to 
her, and hear nothing. 

It was at last of a size to admit a 
body; and he considered it, and the 
human who would remain above, 
and how they were to get up again, 
and thought desperately of killing 
Duncan; but he could not come up 
with Melein in his arms, not so eas- 
ily; and he was not sure whether the 
cloth of his robes could bear his 
weight, or what else might avail. 

“I will go down,” said Duncan, 
and opened a pocket and took out a 
length of cord, and from another a 
small light. He offered these pre- 
cious things with a naive forthright- 
ness that for a moment disarmed 
Niun. 

“The drop,” Niun said, inwardly 
shuddering at the thought of the 
human near Melein, “is my height 
and half again.” 

He did not add what revenge he 
would take if Duncan were careless, 
if he harmed Melein, if he could 
not recover her alive: These things 
were useless to ponder. He sat, 
helpless, and watched as Duncan 
worked his body — a little heavier 
than his own — into that gap and 
dropped, with a heavy sound, into 
the dark. 

Niun listened as he searched be- 
low, through things that rattled and 
moved, through the shifting of rock. 
He leaned close and tried to see the 
tiny glow of the light that Duncan 
held. 

“I have found her.” The words 
floated up out of that cold. And 
then: “She’s alive.” 

Niun wept, safe, where the 
human could not see him; and 
wiped his eyes and sat still, fists 

GALAXY 




clenched on his knees. He knew 
that the human could claim her for 
hostage, could harm her, could 
exact revenge or some terrible oath 
of him; he had not thought through 
these things clearly, a measure of 
his exhaustion and his desperation 
to reach her in time; but now he 
thought, and poised himself on the 
edge of the pit, to go down. 

“Mri! Niun!” Duncan stood in 
the light with a pale burden in his 
arms, a bundle of gold robes that 
lay still against him. “Let down the 
cord. I will try to guide her up.” 

Even as he watched, Melein 
stirred, and moved, and her eyes 
opened on the light in which he 
above could be only a shadow. 

“Melein,” he called down. “Me- 
lein, we will pull you up. This is a 
human, Melein, but do not fear 
him.” 

She struggled when she heard 
that, and Duncan set her feet on the 
floor. Niun saw her look at his face 
in the dim light and draw back in 
horror. 

But she suffered him then to put 
his hands on her waist, and to lift 
her up, by far the easiest and least 
hurtful way for her; but she could 
not lift her hands to. reach Niun’s, 
and protested pain — she once 

kel’e’en. 

“Wait,” Niun objected, and with 
a turn of cord and a knot, 
fashioned a sling and cast it down. 
He wrapped it about hand and arm 
and took the weight carefully as she 
settled in the sling he had made. 
Duncan helped lift, but for a time 
the thin, cutting cord and an upward 
pull bit into Niun’s hands. He tried 
not to rake her against the jagged 
opening, and pulled ever so care- 

THE FADED SUN 



fully, and braced his feet and ig- 
nored the pain of his hands. 

But at last she came through and 
levered herself out onto the sunlit 
dust, tried to rise. He had her, he 
had her safe; and he hugged her to 
her feet and held to her as he had 
held to no living being since child- 
hood, they^ both entangled in the 
cord. He brushed dust and tears 
from her face, she still gasping in 
the outside air. 

“The ship is destroyed,” he said, 
to have all the cruelty done with 
while wounds were still numb. 
“Everyone else is dead, unless 
there is someone else alive down 
there.” 

“No. None. They had no time. 
They were too old to run — they 
would not — they sat still, with the 
she ’pan. Then the House. ...” 

She began to shake as if in the 
grip of a great cold; but she was 
once of the Kel, and she did not 
break. She controlled herself, and 
after a moment began to disentangle 
them both from the cord. 

“None,” he said, to be sure she 
understood it all, “could have pos- 
sibly survived on the ship.” 

She sat down on the edge of the 
section of wall that blocked the 

doors, and smoothed back her mane 
with one hand, her head bowed. 

She found her torn scarf at her 

shoulder and smoothed it and care- 
fully covered her head with that 
light, gauze veil. She was quiet for 
a time, her face still turned from 
him. 

At last she straightened her 

shoulders and pointed over to the 
hole in the rubble, where Duncan 
waited. “And what is he?” she 
asked. 



115 




Niun shrugged. “No matter to 
us. A human. A regul guest. They 
tried to kill him when we met; 
then. ...” 

The surmise that it was this, 
partly his own action, that had killed 
the People and left them orphan, 
was too terrible to speak. His voice 
trailed off, and Melein arose and 
walked from him, to look at the 
ruin, her back to him, her hands 
limp at her sides. The sight of her 
despair was like a wound to him. 

“Melein,” he said to her. “Me- 
lein, what am I to do?” 

She turned to him, gave a tiny, 
helpless gesture. “I am nothing.” 

“What am I to do?” he insisted. 

Sen and Kel: Sen must lead; but 
she had become more than Sen, and 
that was the heaviness on her, 
which he saw she did not want, 
which she had to bear. He stood 
waiting. At last she shut her eyes 
and opened them again. 

“Enemies will come here,” she 
said, beginning clearly to function 
as she had been prepared for years 
to function, to command and to 
plan. She assumed what she must 
assume, she’pan of the People, who 
had no people. “Find us what we 
need for the hills, and we will camp 
there tonight. Give me tonight, 
truebrother — I must not call you 
that; but tonight, that only, and I 
will think what is best for us to 
do.” 

“Rest,” he urged her. “I will do 
that.” 

And when he had seen her seated 
and out of the direct sun, he bent 
down over the hole and cast the 
cord down. 

“Duncan.” 

The human ’s white face appeared in 
116 



the center of the light, anxious and 
frightened. “Lift me up,” he said, 
laying hand on the cord, which 
Niun refused to give solidity. “Mri, 
1 have helped you. Now lift me out 
of here.” 

“Search for the things I name 
and I will draw them up by the 
cord. And after that I will draw you 
up.” 

Duncan hesitated there, as if he 
thought that, like humans, a mri 
would lie. But he agreed then, and 
sought with his tiny light until he 
had found all the things that Niun 
requested of him. He tied each 
small bundle onto the cord for Niun 
to draw up; food, and waterflasks, 
and cording and four bolts of un- 
sewn black cloth, for they could not 
reach better without delaying to 
pierce a new opening, and Duncan 
avowed he did not think it safe. 

A last time the cord came up, 
bearing a bolt of cloth; and a last 
time Niun cast it down, this time 
for Duncan, and braced it about his 
body and his arm. 

It was not as difficult as with Me- 
lein’s uncooperating weight. He 
leaned and braced his feet, and 
Duncan hauled himself up — gained 
the lip of the hole and heaved him- 
self to safety, panting, bent double, 
coughing and trying to stop the 
bleeding. The coughing went on 
and on, and Melein came from her 
place of rest to look down on the 
human in mingled disgust and pity. 

“It is the air,” Niun said. “He 
has been running, and he is not ac- 
climated to Kesrith.” 

“Is he a manner of kel’en?” 
asked Melein. 

“Yes,” Niun said. “But he does 
not offer any threat. The regul 

GALAXY 




hunted him; likely now they would 
cease to care — unless this man’s 
superior is still alive. What shall we 
do with him?" 

Duncan seemed to know they spoke 
of him; perhaps he knew a few 
words of the language of the 
People, but they spoke the High 
Language, and surely he could not 
follow diat. 

Melein shrugged, turned her head 
from him. "As you please. We will 
go now.” 

And she began, slowly, to walk 
through the ruin, picking her way 
with care. 

"Duncan,” said Niun, "pick up 
the supplies and come.” 

The human looked outrage at 
him, as if minded to dispute this 
order as a matter of dignity; and 
Niun expected it, waited for it. But 
then Duncan knelt down and with 
the cord made a bundle of goods, 
heaving it to his shoulder as he 
arose. 

Niun indicated that he should go, 
and the human carried the burden 
where Niun aimed him, his 
footsteps weaving and uncertain in 
the wake of Melein. 

« * * 

No firing had touched the hills. 
They came into a sheltered place 
that was as it had been before the 
attack, before the discords of regul 
or mri or humans — a shelter safe 
from airships, withdrawn as it was 
beneath a sandstone ledge. 

With a great sigh Melein sank 
down on the sand in that cold 
shadow, and bent, her head against 
her knees, as if this had been all 
that she could do, the last step that 

THE FADED SUN 



she could take. She was hurt. Niun 
had watched her walk and knew 
that she was in great pain, that he 
thought was in her side and not her 
limbs. When she was content to 
stop, he took the supplies from Dun- 
can and made haste to spread a 
cloth for a groundsheet and a cover 
for Melein. He gave her drink, and 
a bit of dried meat, and watched, 
sitting on his heels, as she drank 
and ate and leaned against the bare 
rock to rest. 

“May 1 drink?” 

The human’s quiet request re- 
minded him he had another charge 
on him; and he measured out a cap- 
fill of water and passed it to Dun- 
can’s shaking hands. 

"Tomorrow maybe,” said Niun, 
“we will tap a luin and have water 
enough to drink.” 

He considered the human, who 
drank at the water drop by drop, a 
haggard and filthy creature who by 
appearances ought not to have sur- 
vived so far. It was not likely that 
he could survive much further as he 
was. He stank, sweat and sulphur 
compounded with human. Niun 
found himself hardly cleaner. 

"Can you — ” he said to Me- 
lein, almost having forgotten that 
her personal name was not for him 
to speak freely now. He offered her 
his pistol. "Can you stay awake 
long enough to watch this human a 
time?” 

"I am well enough,” she said, 
and drew up on one knee and rested 
wrist and pistol on it in an at- 
titude more kel’e’en than she’pan. 
By caste, she should not touch 
weapons; but many things ought to 
be different, and could not be. 

Niun left them so and went out of 

117 




sight of the ledge, and stripped and 
bathed, as mri on dry worlds did, in 
the dry sand, even to his mane 
which, when he shook the sand out, 
recovered its glossy feel quickly 
enough. He felt better when he had 
done these things, and he dressed 
again, and began to retrace his steps 
toward the cave. 

A heavy body moved behind 
him, an explosive breath and plain- 
tive sound: dus. He turned care- 
fully, for he had left his gun with 
Melein, and nothing else could give 
a ha-dus pause. 

It was the miuk’ko, gaunt, for- 
lorn, scab-hided. But the face was 
dry and it shambled forward with 
careless abandon. 

Niun’s heart beat rapidly; the 
situation was a bad one in potential, 
for all the dusei were unpredictable. 
But the dus came to him and lifted 
its head, thrusting it against his 
chest, uttering that dus-master 
sound that begged food, shelter, 
whatever things mri and dus shared. 

He knelt down there, for the 
moment demanded it, and embraced 
the scrofulous neck and relaxed 
against the beast, letting it touch 
and be touched. A sense of warmth 
came over him, a feeling deep and 
almost sensual mingling with the 
lower beast-functions of the dus- 
mind, that could be content with 
very little. 

This the dus lent him. He looked 
up then, aware of presence, and 
saw two stranger-dusei on the 
sandstone ridge above; he was not 
afraid. This dus knew them, and 
they knew him, and this knowing, 
like the warmth, came at a level too 
low for reason. It was fact. It was 
as dependable as the rock on which 

118 



they stood, mri and dus. Thus the 
creature absorbed his pain, and 
melted it, and fed him back strength 
as slow and powerful as its own. 

And when he made his way back 
to the cave, the great beast lum- 
bered after him, a docile compan- 
ion, a comical and friendly fellow 
that — beholding the human — was 
suddenly neither comic nor friendly. 

Distrust: That reached Niun's 

mind through the impulses of the 
dus; but that subsided as the dus felt 
the human’s outright terror. This 
one feared. Therefore he was safe. 
The dus put thought of the human 
aside and settled down athwart the 
entrance, radiating impulses of ward 
and protection. 

“He came,” said Niun, gathering 
his pistol from Melein’s hand. 
“There are more out there, but 
none even vaguely familiar.” 

“The old pact,” she said, “is 
still valid with us and them.” 

And he knew that they might 
have no better guardian; and that he 
could sleep this night, sure that noth- 
ing would pass the dus to harm 
Melein. He was overwhelmingly 
grateful for this. The exhaustion he 
had held back came down like a 
flood. The dus lifted his head and 
gave that pleasure-moan, a gap- 
mouthed smile, tongue lolling. It 
flicked across the lips and disap- 
peared into a dusine smugness. 

Niun spoke to it, using the small 
nonsense- words the dusei loved, 
and touched its massive head, pleas- 
ing it; and then he took its paw and 
turned it, the size of it more than a 
man could easily hold in his hands. 
The claws curled inward, drawing 
his wrist against the dewclaw: re- 
flex. It broke the skin, admitting the 

GALAXY 




venom. Niun had sought this. It 
\vould not harm him in such a small 
dose; by similar degrees he would 
become immune to this particular 
dus, and need never fear it. He took 
his hand back and caressed the flat 
skull, bringing a rumbling sound of 
contentment from the beast. 

Then, because he could not bear 
the thought of bedding down with 
the human’s filth, he took up an 
armload of cloth and bade the 
human come with him, and took 
him out beyond the ledge. 

“Bathe,” he told Duncan, and 
casting down the cloth when Dun- 
can seemed dismayed, he bent and 
with a handful of sand on his own 
arm, demonstrated how. He sat with 
arms folded, eyes generally averted 
somewhat, as the human cleansed 
himself; and the curious ha-dusei 
watched from the heights, grouping 
and circling in alarm at sight of the 
strange, pale-skinned creature. 

Duncan jooked rather more pleas- 
ant when he had scrubbed the blood 
from his face and the tear-streaks 
had been evened out to a dusty 
sameness. He shook the sand from 
his hair and picked up his discarded 
clothing and started to dress, but 
Niun tore a length from the cloth 
and tore it in such a way that it 
could be worn. He thrust it at the 
human, who doubtfully put it on, as 
if this were some intended shame to 
him. 

Then Niun thought to search the 
clothing that the human had taken 
off, and found pockets full of things 
of which the human had not spo- 
ken. He opened his hand, dem- 
onstrating the knife that he had 
found. Duncan shrugged. 

Niun gave him credit at least that 

THE FADED SUN 



he had not attempted any rashness, 
but bided his time. The human had 
played the round well, though he 
had lost it. 

Niun thrust a second wad of 
black cloth at him. “Veil your- 
self,” he said. “Your nakedness 
offends the she ’pan and me.” 

Duncan settled the veil over his 
head, ineptly attempting to make it 
stay, for he had not the art. Niun 
showed him how to twist it to make 
a band of it, and how to arrange the 
veil; and Duncan looked the better 
for it, decently covered. He was not 
robed as kel’en, which would have 
been improper; but he was in kel- 
black and modestly clothed as a 
man and not as an animal. Niun 
looked on him with a nod of ap- 
proval. 

“This is better for you,” he said. 
“It will protect your skin. Bury 
your clothing. You .will find when 
we travel in the day that our way is 
best.” 

“Are we moving?” 

Niun shrugged. “The she’pan 
makes that decision. 1 am kel’en. 1 
take her orders.” 

Duncan dropped to his knees and 
dug a hole, animal fashion, and put 
his discarded clothing in it. He 
paused when he had smoothed it 
over, and looked up. 

“And if I could offer you a safe 
way off this world — ” 

“Can you?” 

Duncan rose to his feet. He had a 
new dignity, veiled. Niun had never 
noticed the color of his eyes. They 
were light brown. Niun had never 
seen the like. 

“1 could find a way,” Duncan 
said, “to contact my people and get 
a ship down here for you. I think 



119 




you have something to lose by not 
taking that offer. I think you would 
like very much to get her out of 
this.” 

Niun moved his hand to his 
weapons, warning. ‘‘Tsi’mri, you 
do assume too much. And if you 
make plans, present them to her, 
not to me. I told you: I am only 
kel’en. If something pleases her, 1 
do it. If something annoys her, I 
remove it.” 

Duncan did not move. Presuma- 
bly he reconsidered his disre- 
spect. “I do not understand,” he 
said finally. “Evidently I don’t un- 
derstand how things are with you. 
Is this your wife?” 

The obscenity was so naively put, 
in so puzzled a tone, that Niun al- 
most laughed in surprise. “No,” he 
said, and to further confound the 
human: “She is my Mother.” 

And' he motioned Duncan to 
cease delaying him; he grew anx- 
ious for Melein, and there were the 
ha-dusei about them, that snuffed 
the air and called soft cries from 
their higher perch. One came down 
as they left the area. Doubtless the 
clothes would not stay buried, but 
neither would there be much left of 
them to catch the eye of searchers. 

The dus at the entry of their ref- 
uge lifted his head and pricked his 
tiny ears forward at their approach, 
radiating feelings of welcome; and 
Niun, already sensing the flush of 
the poison within himself, and 
knowing he would feel it stronger in 
the hours of the night, offered his 
fingers to its nose and brushed past, 
putting his body between it and 
Duncan. 

Melein took note of the human 
and nodded in approval of the 



change; but no further interest in 
him did she show this night. She 
settled down to rest in peace now 
that they had returned. And Niun 
drank a very small ration of water 
and lay down and watched as the 
human likewise stretched himself 
out as far from them and the beast 
as he might in the little space. 

In time Niun let his eyes close, 
his mind full, so over-burdened that 
at last there was nothing to do but 
abandon all thought and let go. The 
dus-fever was in him. He drifted 
toward low-mind dreams that were 
the murky, sometimes frightening, 
impulses of the dus; but he feared 
no harm from the impulses because 
it was in the lore of the Kel that no 
kel’en had ever been harmed by his 
own dus, it being sane. 

And he was owned by this beast, 
and the beast by him; and he com- 
passed his present world by this and 
by Melein. He had been utterly des- 
olate in the morning, and at this 
evening he rested, kel-ignorant, 
with a dus to guard his sleep and 
touch his mind, and with once more 
a she ’pan to take up the burden of 
planning. His heart was pained for 
Melein’s burden, but he did not try 
to bear it. She would have her 
honor. He had his, and it was vastly 
more simple. 

To obey the she’pan. To avenge 
the People. 

He stared at the human during his 
waking intervals and once, in the 
dark, he knew that the human was 
awake and looking at him. They did 
not speak.

GALAXY 




Is seeing believing? It all depends on 
what you mean by seeingl Take Sodom 
and Gomorrah, for example 



Xhe shrieker, to Tarpi’s delight, 
landed squarely atop the treated 
sugar cube. It slowly rotated on its 
pudgy legs, its goatee of sensory 
hairs wiggling as it examined the 
top surface and edges of the cube. 

Tarpi began to recite “How Doth 
the Little Busy Bee” as he 
watched. He had reached “How 
cheerfully he seems to grin,” hav- 
ing wandered into another poem 
along the way, when the shrieker 
gave a tiny cry like a terrified field 
mouse, spread its wing and rose 
into the air, the sugar cube pinched 
tightly between two rows of legs. 

Tarpi watched until it vanished 
from sight behind a tree, then 
turned to his companion and said, 
“Okay, give me the box-box now, 
Hester. ” 

Hester was four feet high and re- 
sembled a chimpanzee. She had 
scaly, straw-yellow skin blotched 
with green. A particularly large 
blotch on her flat chest could, with 
considerable imagination, be con- 
strued to resemble a capital A. Her 
face consisted of a large, rigid 
mouth with which she also 
breathed; and a broad band of black 
Velvet stretched across the area 
where a chimpanzee normally has 

the purblind people 



eyes. An inflated balloon of skin 
beneath the chin completed the pic- 
ture. 

“Hester” was not how she was 
usually identified, of course, but 
since it apparently pleased Tarpi to 
do so, she was too polite to mention 
it. She handed him the “box-box.” 

The remote display showed Tarpi 
a dense cluster of red dots moving 
slowly over a schematic landscape. 
Each dot represented the location of 
one of the tiny transmitters with 
which the sugar cube was doped. 
When the sugar was eaten by the 
shrieker’s mound-mates, each would 
ingest a transmitter or two as 
well — and thus broadcast its loca- 
tion for a few days. 

And if a person had a pair of 
highly directional receivers and a 
fairly bright computer like, say, the 
receivers he had spent most of the 
morning setting up, plus the com- 
puter back at base camp, then he 
could obtain a lot of information 
about the shriekers’ habits very 
quickly. It beat hell out of daubing 
their backs with paint and following 
them around, but Tarpi sometimes 
felt the advantage was nullified by 
having to suffer through myriad 
obscene jokes based on his being a 
“bug-bugger.” 



123 




He followed the shrieker’s prog- 
ress for several minutes when a 
drop of rain falling onto the display 
screen diverted his attention. Be- 
tween tree trunks he could see out 
onto the rolling prairie that sur- 
rounded the grove. To the north an 
approaching squall line had dark- 
ened the sky from gray near the 
Zenith to black, shot with livid 
green, near the horizon. 

As he watched, a double fork of 
lightning arced down to assault the 
prairie. Tarpi decided that he was in 
for a good soaking and cursed him- 
self for not having brought weather 
gear. He scooted over a few feet so 
that the strut of the buttress tree he 
had been leaning against arched 
over him, providing some shelter. A 
few large, economy-sized raindrops 
plopped down nearby. 

The balloon under Hester’s chin 
shivered and she spoke in a con- 
tinuous buzz, E above middle C, 
without pauses between words: 
“Bad storm comming Tarpi four 
twisting winds should go inside 
now.” 

"Not twisting winds — torna- 
does,” he corrected her absently, 
intent on the display screen. He 
had already made his own predic- 
tion; he had seen several of these 
storms before. 

Hester tugged at his sleeve. 
“Please must go now Tarpi tor- 
nadoes come very soon.” Random 
raindrops continued to plop down 
around them. 

“We’re just going to get rained 
on a little is all, Hester. Get in here 
under the tree if it bothers you.” 

The shrieker had apparently 
reached its mound; its location had 
remained steady for several min- 

124 



utes. Tarpi set the display down and 
reached for his notetaper. 

Hester snatched up both display 
and recorder and ran off through the 
grove. 

“Hey, come back here with that! 
Here, Hester! Come here!” 

He was more surprised than an- 
gry; none of the Chimps had ever 
shown any signs of aggression be- 
fore. He scrambled to his feet, 
scraping his forehead on the tree 
strut overhead, and set off after 
Hester, who by now had a twenty- 
yard start. 

There was a sharp prack of thun- 
der and a rolling barrage of rain 
overtook them, the huge drops rat- 
tling through the crisp yellow leaves 
of the buttress trees, making more 
noise than Tarpi would have be- 
lieved. It sounded like a hailstorm 
in a furniture factory. 

Hester’s smaller size and greater 
agility enabled her to pass through 
the intermingled buttress struts more 
easily than Tarpi, so she gained 
steadily. However, she soon ran out 
of the grove and onto the green 
matted prairie, where Tarpi’s longer 
legs gave him the advantage. At the 
top of a low hill he caught up with 
her and swung her around by an 
arm. The display and recorder 
dropped to the waterlogged turf. 

“Now what the hell is this!” He 
was almost angry now — his head 
was beginning to ache and he was 
soaked. 

“Tornadoes Tarpi.” 

She pointed to the top of the 
grove. Like the legs of a lopsided 
elephant, four tornadoes swept 
down from the brutal black sky to 
the green prairie. As Tarpi watched, 
the nearest passed over a small 

GALAXY 




patch of cottonweed and plucked it 
10 bare stalks. Now that they were 
out of the clatter of rain on leaf, he 
was conscious of a low, dull rum- 
bling like a distant ore -crusher. The 
tornadoes twisted slowly toward 
them. 

The wind suddenly freshened, 
gusting cold on Tarpi’s soaked skin. 
Hester was squirming in his grasp. 

“Must go now Tarpi.” 

“‘Damn right.” 

He released her and followed her 
down the far side of the hill, the 
wind at their backs hurrying them 
along. Another grove lapped up 
against the foot of the hill. Hester 
lead them into and through it, up 
another hill and then down into a 
liny valley that had been carved out 
by a small stream trickling down its 
center. Hester thrashed through the 
dense growth of red-shot green 



grass on either bank and forded the 
stream without slowing. 

Tarpi sloshed to a halt just short 
of the place where the normal 
broadleafed groundcover ended and 
the ohhell weed started. He had dis- 
covered the weed and inadvertently 
given it its name when he stum- 
bled into it for a second time. He 
had every intention of avoiding a 
third dose. 

Hester was halfway up the far 
side of the valley before she noticed 
that he was no longer following her. 
She turned around and went back. 

““Please Tarpi hurry.” He could 
hear her dimly over the wind and 
rain and tornado growl. 

Both banks were covered with 
red-shot green as far as he could 
see. The wind gave a particularly 
violent thrust, driving an iced rain- 
drop into his ear just as Hester

waded into the far edge of the 
stream. 

“Oh, hell.” Tarpi stepped out 
into the weed. Hester turned again 
to lead the way. 

As they crested the far rim of the 
valley, Tarpi caught sight of their 
destination, a grove of large buttress 
trees snuggled in a valley on the far 
side of the divide. Built in under 
and around the trees was a collec- 
tion of small, free-form wooden 
houses. It was a Chimp village. 

The rain stopped but the wind 
was gusting so violently that Tarpi 
staggered drunkenly as he panted 
down the last slope. Hester, in the 
lead, picked a low house built 
around the base of a huge buttress, 
stopped to kiss the lintel and en- 
tered. Tarpi, the rumble of the tor- 
nado loud behind him, went down 
on all fours and entered without 
ceremony. Someone slammed a 
heavy wooden door behind him, 
dulling the wind’s shriek and the 
tornadoes’ roar and cutting off the 
light from outside. 

“Greetings to my home Tarpi.” 
The light leaking through the cracks 
around the door and the shutters 
was not sufficient for Tarpi to see 
his host. 

“Thanks,” he gasped. 

Suddenly it sounded as though a 
waterfall were pounding on the roof 
of the house. The shutters banged 
against their latches; small stones 
and dirt shot through every gap in 
the walls. Then the roaring in- 
creased further until it seemed to 
drill straight into Tarpi’s ears with 
lancets of pain. He opened his 
mouth wide and tensed his throat 
muscles. His ears popped and the 
pain vanished. The roaring con- 



tinued for only seconds, then died 
abruptly, and his ears stabbed at 
him again. The tornado tossed in a 
few more stones as a parting shot 
and then — as well as Tarpi’s be- 
numbed hearing could judge — all 
was quiet. 

His eyes had adjusted enough that 
he could see dimly by the light that 
leaked around the door and shutters. 
He could make out what he as- 
sumed were Hester and a half a 
dozen of her friends, all unmoving, 
in relaxed postures, comotose. Tarpi 
decided they were probably just 
stunned and blinded by the noise 
levels they had just experienced. 
When you “see” by sonar, close 
contact with a tornado must be akin 
to a laser flash in the eyes. The 
harmonics would have affected 
them even though there was not 
much output in the thirty-thousand- 
cycle range they used. 

He crawled over to a window, 
again bumping his head when he 
forgot the low ceiling, and un- 
latched the shutters. The sun, low 
under a shelf of clouds, poured 
sickly yellow light into the house, 
making him blink. The scene out- 
side reminded him of the underside 
of a set of bleachers. The buttress 
trees, now almost totally denuded of 
leaves, were an angular collection 
of struts and uprights, but they had 
apparently sustained little structural 
damage. The village also seemed 
unhurt, although to human eyes 
Chimp villages always looked clut- 
tered and unfinished. Being unable 
to perceive color, their inhabitants 
made use of sculpture and carving 
for decoration; the sculpture gener- 
ally represented plants or animals 
and was crudely done. The surfaces 



126 



GALAXY 




of the houses were either left rough 
or coarsely carved in haphazard 
geometrical patterns, and boards 
were not of standard sizes or closely 
fitted. The whole effect was rather 
slapdash. 

The door in an A-frame across 
the way swung open and two 
Chimps stumbled out looking none 
too light on their feet but none the 
worse for wear. Tarpi could hear 
his hosts starting to move around 
behind him, and he — 

His left instep burst into flame. 

"Oh, hell!” 

A second locus started on his 
right foot as the first spread to en- 
circle his ankle. It started itching as 
well. He was in for an extremely 
uncomfortable few hours as the 
rings of fire would work their way 
slowly up his body. Evidently his 
previous exposures had not lessened 
his sensitivity, but there was a tube 
of calpermine lotion in the health 
kit back at camp that could help — if 
it had not blown away. 

He scrambled through the low 
door and set off at a dead run. 

II 

The expedition’s base camp was 
a two-hundred-foot circle of ultra- 
tough monomolecular film, the 
edges buried deep, the sides bulged 
upward into a low dome by a per- 
manent static charge. Varicolored 
opaque and translucent patches gave 
it the look, from a distance, of a 
huge fungus growing out of the 
prairie. 

In an equipment-cluttered room 
beneath a round, clear patch near 
the center of thq dome sat a 
chunky, dark-haired woman, mildly 



chiding a persnickity computer. 

"Come on now. Marvel. Stop 
that.” She pressed the "Program” 
key again and repeated, slowly and 
carefully: "Make radio check of 
status of all expedition members on 
remote duty.” 

"Unintelligible command,” the 
computer replied. Its voice always 
reminded Allis of a Chimp’s voice; 
it had the same buzzing, continuous 
quality. 

She thought for a moment and 
then tried once more: "Make radio 
check of condition of all expedition 
members on remote duty.” 

"Running,” Marvel responded 
and rewarded her with a light show, 
listing the name of each expedition 
member plus columns for each of 
several possible conditions. As Allis 
watched, some of the X’s moved 
from "Contact Not Yet Made” to 
"Condition Satisfactory.” 

’Dumm and ’Dee came over from 
the opposite side of the room — they 
had been fiddling with a freeze- 
dried gryphon specimen — to watch 
over Allis’s shoulder. 

"What is Marvelcomputer doing 
now Allis?” ’Dumm (or was it 
’Dee? Both had almost identical 
green blothes.) asked. 

Allis explained briefly about 
radio, and how she wanted to know 
if anyone had been hurt in the storm 
or was in need of anything because 
of it. When she finished talking, all 
the X’s had moved into the "Condi- 
tion Satisfactory” column except 
three. 

She pressed the "Program” key 
again. "Make voice contact 
with. .” she picked the first name 
on the list. "Hellene Eisen.” 

' “Complete.” 



THE PURBLIND PEOPLE

“Hellene, this is Allis. We need 
to know if you’re okay. Come on, 
Hellene, please answer.” 

She continued to speak through 
the tiny personal radio for thirty 
seconds or so, not knowing if Hel- 
lene was there, dead, miles away, 
alive or washing-her-hair-can’t- 
come-to-the-phone-now-sorry. She 
was about to give up when Hellene 
answered in a barely audible whis- 
per. 

"Of course I’m okay. Now will 
you be quiet, you’re going to spook 
them.” She broke contact. 

Allis noticed that Hellene’s X had 
moved into “Condition Satisfac- 
tory.” Marvel had been eavesdrop- 
ping. 

Something-kissed the back of her 
neck. For a moment she thought 
that ’Dumm or ’Dee might have 
been smitten with passion for her. 
Then she turned around — and kissed 
her husband back. 

“Stamm! I’m so glad you’re 
here. I’m afraid you’re going to 
have to make some pick-ups.” 

“I like that. I fly through rain, 
snow, heat and gloom of night just 
to get back to you and all you want 
to do is put me out to work.” 

She ignored him, attempting 
again to make contact with her two 
fallen sparrows. Stamm tried to ex- 
change glances with ’Dee (“See 
what we men have to put up 
with?”) but failed, the other not 
being equipped for it, so he stood 
and watched in silence. 

After a couple of minutes,. Allis 
gave him her attention again. “I 
can’t make contact with either Tarpi 
or Rodder. As near as I can tell, 
Tarpi’s last campsite was very near 
the center of the storm track, so you 

128 



had better go check on him first. 
Rodder was sort of on the fringes, 
so he’s — ” 

“Hey, lookit,” Stamm inter- 
rupted. Marvel was putting on 
another light show but the spelling 
and grammar were not up to her 
usual standards. It was Tarpi, using 
his remote display terminal to mes- 
sage them. “Calpermine!” Stamm 
hooted. “Some people never 
learn.” 

“Okay, you’d better pick him up 
first, then hunt around and see if 
you (ian find Rodder. He probably 
hasn’t moved too far from where 
you dropped him.” 

“Shall I take Tarpi some calper- 
mine or should we let him learn 
from experience?” 

“You most certainly shall take 
him some. Sometimes. Stamm. .” 

“Just kidding.” He turned and 
started out. ’Dumm and ’Dee fol- 
lowed him. 

“May ’Dumm and ’Dee come 
too Stamm?” one of them asked. 

“Sorry, fellas. No room this 
time.” 

’Dumm and ’Dee were not 
equipped to look disappointed. They 
went back to watch Allis, who was 
telling Tarpi that a relief force was 
on the way. 



Ill 

Nothing remained of Tarpi’s 
campsite except the tentsheet, one 
edge of which had been buried and 
held fast. Unable to find his radio, 
Tarpi was returning to the Chimp 
village to see if they had anything 
to treat the itching, burning brands 
around his thighs when he found his 



GALAXY 




notetaper and remote display termi- 
nal, both atop the knoll where Hes- 
ter had dropped them. 

Hester had joined him shortly 
after he had called for help, and it 
was there that Stamm found them, 
Tarpi scratching and cursing, Hester 
watching impassively. As Stamm 
set the flitter down, Tarpi ran to the 
landing site and when Stamm pop- 
ped the dome, Tarpi was almost 
standing in his lap. 

“Give me the calpermine.” 

“Patience, Tarpi. Now let me 
see, calpermine, calpermine. I know 
I put it here somewhere.” 

“Goddammit, Stamm, give it 
here.” 

“Language, son. There’s a lady 
present.” He indicated Hester. 

“You’ve got just one sec- 
ond. ...” Stamm handed over the 
tube. Tarpi sat on the rain-matted 
ground and began to smear the 
ointment on the affected areas. 

“What is that Tarpi?” Hester 
wanted to know. 

“I don’t know.” He was too 
busy, too angry, to be bothered. 

“It’s called ‘calpermine,’ ” 
Stamm supplied. “It’s supposed to 
keep Tarpi from itching so much.” 

Hester digested the statement. 
Then she announced; “I am called 
‘Hester.’ ” 

“Pleased to meet you, Hester. 
My name’s Stanun.” 

“Yes.” 

Tarpi stood and pulled his pants 
up. “If the amenities are satisfied, 
can we get out of here now?” 

“Hop in.” Stamm indicated the 
empty cabin. 

“C’mon, Hester.” Tarpi flopped 
into one of the seats. 

“Won’t you join us, Hester?” 

THE PURBLIND PEOPLE 



Stamm asked, his tone mildly re- 
buking to Tarpi. 

Hester joined them without ask- 
ing where they were going, Stamm 
noticed. They were like that — 
curious about everything and willing 
to try anything, with no thought for 
possible danger. They reminded him 
of something he had never quite 
been able to put his finger on — 
children were the closest, except 
that there was nothing childlike 
about them. 

They rose straight up for a few 
hundred feet and headed almost due 
south. The sky was clear and from 
that height there was no sign of the 
tornadoes’ passage. 

“Hey, where are we going, 
Stamm? Camp’s over that way.” 
Tarpi gestured toward the left. 
“Isn’t it?” 

“Got to check on Rodder first. 
Allis couldn’t make contact with 
him:” 

“Hell, he’s probably just not 
communicating with anyone below 
the rank of God again. And even 
He’d have to let it ring twice and 
call back.” 

“And like as not. Rodder would 
get huffy and hang up on Him any- 
way,” Stamm agreed. “You sound 
like the calpermine must be help- 
ing.” 

“Some. It’s down to merely ex- 
cruciating . hey, ruggers!” 

Tarpi pointed down to the prairie. 
A thin, meandering trail of 
yellowish-green marred the distant 
perfection. At the near end was 
what looked to be a fifty-foot blob 
of furiously boiling, furry oatmeal. 
There were probably several 
hundred ruggers in the scrum, each 
intent on clawing, scratching and 

129 




elbowing (figuratively) its way to 
the leading edge where the grazing 
was. 

Almost brainless, they were so 
gregarious that a single one re- 
moved from the scrum would sit 
motionless in acute depression until 
it died, and so crotchety that the 
only thing they liked better than 
fighting each other was fighting the 
gryphons that eked out a living by 
preying on them. 

Tarpi had once seen a gryphon 
try to snatch a young rugger. It was 
as though the predator h^ been in- 
stantly enveloped in a corrosive 
blanket; nothing was left behind but 
beak and bones. Ruggers were 
herbivorous — but not fanatic about 
it. 

“I wonder if that’s the same 
scrum I tagged a while back.” 
Tarpi reached around for. 
‘‘Damn, I left the remote terminal 
back there.” 

‘‘Okay, we’ll pick it up on the 
return.” 

‘‘See the ruggers, Hester.” Tarpi 
was mellowing now that the cal- 
permine was starting to take effect. 
He pointed down at them for Hes- 
ter’s benefit. She leaned to look 
along his arm. 

‘‘No but there are people down 
there.” 

‘‘Huh? Who?” 

‘‘She’s right,” Stamm said. 
‘‘See? There, just this side of that 
little rise with the two patches of 
trees and the little pond at the base. 
Their coloring m^es them blend 
in.” 

‘‘Oh, Chimps. I thought maybe 
somebody had moved his camp over 
here. Yes, I see them now.” 

A file of perhaps a dozen 

130 



Chimps, most of them carrying 
bundles, was heading in the direc- 
tion from which the flitter had 
come. 

‘‘Looks like free enterprise in ac- 
tion,” commented Stamm. 

‘‘They bring help for the tor- 
nado,” said Hester. 

‘‘You’re very public-spirited 
people.” 

‘‘I do not understand.” 

‘‘To bring help for the tornado 
victims? There were victims, 
Tarpi?” Stamm asked. 

‘‘I guess so, but I don’t think 
anything serious. I’m not sure.” 

‘‘Two people were killed but no 
one was hurt,” Hester said. 

‘‘Philosophical, isn’t she?” 
Stamm remariced. ‘‘Maybe we 
ought to check on them later.” 

‘‘Maybe.” 

IV 

They found Rodder’s camp in a 
grove of roundheels trees, not far 
from where Stamm had left him 
days before. A gentle breeze stirred 
the balls of leaves at the treetops, 
causing them to nod benignly over 
the limber trunks. In a slightly suf- 
fer gale they would bend almost flat 
against the ground. A few buttress 
trees grew here and there as well, 
but they were mostly young and had 
not yet driven out the scrub growth. 

The camp was laid out as neatly 
as a picture in a field manual, lack- 
ing only a camper. The three wan- 
dered through it, avoiding puddles, 
not touching anything, the two hu- 
mans kicking at the leaves under- 
foot. 

‘‘Nobody to home,” Stamm said. 

‘‘Looks as if,” Tarpi agreed. He 



GALAXY 




put his head into the tent, then went 
all the way in. His voice came out 
slightly muffled. “His personal 
radio doesn’t seem to be here, so he 
must have it with him . hey, this 
is funny.” He emerged with a 
bug-eyed object in one hand. “How 
many of these cameras did the film 
people have, anyway?” 

“One apiece, as you ought to 
remember from their screaming 
about it. Wonder why he doesn’t 
have it with him.” 

“Yeah . maybe he’s out tak- 
ing a crap or something.” Tarpi 
tossed the camera back into the 
tent. 

“Hey, careful with that!” 

“No problem, they’re practically 
indestructible. ...” He took 
another slow look around. “Well, 
nuts, Stamm, all the storm did here 
was to drop a couple of centimeters 
of rain and knock down a few 
leaves, and that certainly wouldn’t 
do Rodder any harm. Let’s get out 
of here.” 

“Might as well, I guess. He’ll 
show up when he damn well 
pleases.” Stamm turned and started 
back toward the flitter. 

“Is that Rodder?” Hester wanted 
to know. She pointed to a small, 
dense plot of head-high roundheels 
clamoring around the base of a dead 
twenty-foot buttress. The two men 
stopped and exchanged glances. 

“That’s Rodder,” Stamm con- 
firmed when they had thrashed their 
way into the undergrowth. The 
body lay on its back, one foot in an 
unused slit latrine, a branch from 
the dead buttress lying at a rakish 
angle across the forehead. Stamm 
knelt, felt the wrist briefly, then 
stood again. 




THE PURBLIND PEOPLE

“He’s dead.” 

Tarpi was astounded: He had 
never seen a dead person before. He 
bent and lifted a hand. He was 
amazed at how limp it was, with 
absolutely no muscle tone. And 
cold . and heavy ... a clammy, 
useless thing that had once been 
somebody’s right arm. 

Stamm had been examining the 
angular growth of the dead buttress 
over their heads. 

“It must have been a hell of a 
freak accident. The one loose 
branch on the whole tree, and he’s 
standing under it the one instant 
when it decides to fall. The storm 
must have jostled it just enough that 
it was barely balanced, and af- 
terward, when Rodder came out 
here to the latrine — surprise! Well, 
let’s get him back and chuck him in 
the hospital. Maybe this’ll cut him 
down to size a little.” 

“I think it’s too late for that, 
Stamm. He’s already cold. He’s 
been dead for a couple of days at 
least.” 

“Goddam. You mean we’re 
going to have to pay off the bond 
on RodderT' His tone implied that 
that was like being fined for step- 
ping on a cockroach. “That will 
almost break the expedition. We’ll 
never be able to show a profit if we 
have to pay off on that.” 

Tarpi rolled the buttress branch 
off of Rodder’s forehead; the struts 
were badly decayed and lighter than 
they looked. 

“I’m afraid it’s worse than that, 
Stamm. Look at the mailcs on his 
forehead. There’s no way that 
branch could have fallen on him 
four separate times. I think he must 
have been murdered.” 



Allis looked in at Rodder’s body, 
an undignified sprawl across the 
back seats of the flitter. She turned 
away, white-faced. 

“Poor Rodder,” she said. Stamm 
snorted, winning himself an angry 
look. “Will you turn his head 
please, Tarpi, so I can see the 
wounds.” 

Tarpi leaned in and tilted the 
head. Allis made a brief inspection, 
smoothing the hair away from the 
forehead. “You’re right. Blud- 
geoned to death, several days ago.” 
She thought for a moment. “Whereare 
Sodom and Gomorrah?” 

“His Chimps? I don’t know. 
Stamm, did you — ” 

“No. They weren’t around the 
camp. They could be anywhere by 
now.” 

Hester spoke up from behind Al- 
lis, causing her to jump. “Sodom 
and Gomorrah are in a town near 
where Rodder was it is their 
home.” 

Allis moved a few feet away. 
“Thank you.” 

“Yes.” 

“Her name is ‘Hester,’ honey,” 
Stamm said. “Hester, this is ‘Al- 
lis.’ ” 

“Yes.” 

Allis ignored her. “Stamm, 
you’d better go see if you can find 
Sodom and Gomorrah and bring 
them back here. And I think Tarpi 
should accompany you.” 

“And Hester too.” 

“Certainly . you’ll want to 
take Rodder inside before you 
leave, of course. No, wait, don’t 



132 



GALAXY 




take him inside, Just dump him on 
the ground by the entrance.” 

“You mean Just lay him out 
there?” 

“No, Just dump him, all in a 
heap. Don’t leave before I get 
back.” She vanished into the main 
tent. 

Removing the body from the flit- 
ter was even tougher than getting it in. 
Finally Stamm had to stand in the back 
seat and heave it over the edge onto the 
ground. Then the two men carried it 
over and, as instructed, dumped it near 
the main entrance. They stood looking 
at it. 

“Shall I maybe straighten him 
out Just a little?” Tarpi asked. 

“No, you shan’t.” Allis emerged 
from the tent, herding ’Dumm and 
’Dee before her. “Leave him as he 
is. You two, go on, scat!” She 
made shooing motions at the two 
Chimps, who moved a few feet 
away to Join Hester. “Here, 
Stamm.” She handed him a pistol. 

“What’s that supposed to be 
for?” Tarpi asked. 

“Ever hear of an unarmed cop?” 
Stamm asked in return. 

“Cop! Somehow I can’t visualize 
you bringing in two unarmed 
Chimps at gunpoint. Or needing to. 
Not to mention the fact that if you 
get hit with a kidnapping charge, 
the fine will make Rodder’s bond 
look like peanuts.” 

“Oh, Stamm. The bond! I’d for- 
gotten all about it,” Allis 
exclaimed. 

“I think it will work out okay, 
hon. The publicity will probably 
double sales of the film.” 

“I certainly hope so. Otherwise 
We’ll wind up in the red for sure. 

the purblind people 



Well, you two had best get started, 
and I have a lot to do too.” She 
turned and vanished into the tent. 

“You don’t really think a Chimp 
did this, do you, Stamm?” Tarpi 
asked when they were airborne. 

“They’re the only obvious sus- 
pects. Sodom and Gomorrah in par- 
ticular. The nearest humans were 
ten or fifteen klicks away, and even 
as much as most of us disliked 
Rodder, I can’t conceive of anyone 
actually doing this to him. And he 
certainly didn’t do it to himself.” 
“But the Chimps have always 
acted so tame, not been aggressive 
at all. Hell, I don’t think they even 
eat meat any more.” 

“Ever look at their teeth?” 

“Sure, that’s Just the point. They 
obviously evolved to be omniverous 
creatures, but they’re vegetarians 
now. You don’t, eat other animals, 
do you, Hester?” 

“No it would hurt too much.” 
“See, a Chimp couldn’t have 
done it; they have ethics.” 

“So have I, but I wouldn’t trust 
myself behind my own back with 
anything sharp, let alone Rod- 
der’s.” 

“Yes, but you had an ax to 
grind. Most of us did. But tell me, 
Stamm, why would a Chimp want 
to kill Rodder? Money, vengeance 
for stealing its woman, what?” 

“I ceased to speculate on the mo- 
tives of humans long before you 
were bom, Tarpi. With ET’s I 
never started. But let me tell you a 
story: When I was a young starman 
apprentice on my very first cruise, 
we landed on a nice, pastoral 
planet, almost as nice as this one. 
Deneb IV, you may know it. Any- 
way, the natives — sort of tall, fuzzy 

133 




flitterbicks — came out and made 
offerings to the great silver thing 
from the sky, sang hosannas to us, 
the whole bit. Looked friendly as 
could be. Well, there wasn’t a man 
or woman aboard that ship who 
wasn’t dying to run through fields 
of fresh clover, or the local equiva- 
lent, so the captain suppressed his 
better judgment and turned us loose. 
A couple of days went by, nothing 
much happened. The locals loved 
having the gods hobnob with them, 
we all had a terrific time. Then the 
purser showed up hanging from a 
tree by a stake driven through his 
head — in one ear and out the other. 
And do you know why?” 

“Spitting on the slidewalk?” 
“Worse. He had failed to urinate 
in a public place. Sneaked off be- 
hind a tree and offended it. So if 
you can prove to me that Rodder 
positively did not do the moral 
equivalent of private urination, then 
I might believe you.” 

“Okay, so it’s a lousy argument. 
But I still have trouble believing a 
Chimp did it.” 

“Then who did?” 

VI 

“It was a man,” said Sodom. 
They had landed as before at 
Rodder’s campsite, then followed 
Hester through the brush about a 
kilometer to a tiny Chimp village of 
only three houses and a couple of 
outbuildings. They were all built 
along the same pattern — low, flat 
teepees, each radiating outward 
from a central tree, the largest of 
which was a buttress, the rest being 
fairly old roundheels. 

The place looked to Tarpi like the 



Chimp equivalent of a family farm. 
The first Chimp they approached, a 
fairly old male, had answered to 
“Gomorrah” and Stamm claimed to 
recognize him. “Sodom” was a 
barely mature male, apparently a 
relative of Gomorrah’s. Neither had 
seemed unwilling to answer 
questions. 

“You mean a Chimp, a person 
like yourself,” Stamm corrected. 

“No a man like you.” 

“Was it a man or a woman?” 
Tarpi asked. 

“A man he had no hair.” 

Tarpi stroked the fashionable 
skullcap atop his crew cut. “That’s 
hardly conclusive. A woman with 
her hair tucked up into one of these 
caps would look as though she had 
no hair either. But you’re sure it 
was a human?” 

“Yes.” 

“Who was he? What did he look 
like?” Stamm demanded. 

“A strange man I had never seen 
before.” 

“What did he look like?” Stamm 
repeated. 

Sodom paused. ”... a strange 
man.” 

“What about you, Gomorrah? 
Did you see him too?. What did he 
look like?” 

“Yes a strange man.” 

“Ask if they would know him if 
they saw him again,” Tarpi 
suggested. 

Sodom had overheard him. 
“Yes.” 

“What happened? What did he 
do?” 

“He came in from the prairie fol- 
lowed Rodder into the latrine and 
hit him with a piece of tree.” 

“That’s all?” Stamm was in- 



134 



GALAXY 




credulous. “He just wanders in off 
the prairie and without saying a 
word, starts banging on Rodder! He 
doesn’t say anything, Rodder 
doesn’t say anything, you don’t say 
anything?’’ 

“Rodder said ‘no don’t’ and 
screamed painfully while he died.’’ 

“That’s a//?’’ 

But apparently it was. Further 
questioning elucidated little more 
detail. The killer had come from an 
unobserved direction and had left 
toward the north, where, as far as 
anyone knew, there were no human 
encampments. Rodder had appar- 
ently seen him just as he was being 
struck. The two Chimps had been 
some distance away and had not 
seen fit to interfere. They were 
vague as to when it had happened, 
saying only that it was on the day 
Stamm had dropped off the party. 

The men withdrew for a whis- 
pered conversation. 

“Sounds fishy to me,’’ Stamm 
said. “That’s just what you’d ex- 
pect them to say if one of them had 
done it. Each one vouches for the 
other and both blame some mysteri- 
ous human.” 

“You make them sound like 
green and yellow Machiavel- 
lis . but I don’t see that we have 
much choice but to take them back 
and let them try to identify one of 
us.” 

“And get somebody held on 
murder charges on their say-so?” 

“Well, yes. But if they each 
identify the same person, there’s a 
good chance that person’s the killer 
and we certainly don’t want him 
running around loose, do we? And 
if they did it themselves, like as not 
they’ll each pick somebody different 



and each of those will have been a 
hundred klicks away with two other 
people. And then we’ll have some 
reasonable evidence against them, 
not just circumstance.” 

“Hell, a good lawyer would just 
claim they made a mistake.” 

“Yes, but with only a hundred 
and seventeen of us on the whole 
planet, it would be a lot harder to 
make that stand up. They would 
have seen every last possible sus- 
pect.” 

“Okay, let’s see if they’ll come 
with us.” 

They returned to the Chimps. 
“Sodom, Gomorrah, we’d ap- 
preciate it if you’d come back to 
our main camp and see if you can 
pick out the man who killed Rod- 
der,” Stamm told them. 

“Why?” 

Stamm was nonplussed. As well 
explain why it’s light in the day- 
time. “Rodder is dead, murdered. 
We want to catch and punish the 
culprit.” 

“Why?” 

“It is in accord with our cus- 
toms,” Tarpi said. 

The two Chimps conferred and 
then appeared to consult Hester. 
None of the conversation was audi- 
ble to the humans. 

“We will come.” 

VII 

When they radioed Allis the situ- 
ation, she went into action, ordering 
all expedition members to drop 
what they were doing and prepare 
to report back to base camp as soon 
as Stamm could pick them up. 
Tarpi had the feeling that she had 
been wanting to re-assert her author- 



THE PURBLIND PEOPLE 



135 




ity by calling a general meeting and 
welcomed the mammoth line-up as 
an excuse. 

Not unnaturally, most of her invi- 
tations were declined without 
thanks, and were accepted only 
when she threatened to completely 
cut off computer services. Since 
Marvel performed almost all data 
storage, from recording movie pic- 
tures to taping field notes, the 
members had little choice but to at- 
tend, although they did not have to 
be nice about it. 

But as they filtered in by ones 
and twos past Rodder’s body — a 
sprawled and undignified heap 
where she had had Stamm and 
Tarpi leave it — their mood changed 
considerably and by midnight, when 
they were finally assembled in the 
circular common room, Allis faced 
a group that was at least not totally 
hostile. She used a chair to step up 
onto a table and instantly had their 
attention. 

“Well, you’ve all seen what hap- 
pened to Rodder. Of course the re- 
sponsibility is entirely mine, and 
Stamm and I will pay quite heavily 
for my error. Better judgment indi- 
cated that going about in parties of 
less than three persons was unwise 
but the prima donnas among you 
convinced me that it was impossible 
for them to carry on ‘their work’ 
with other people jostling their el- 
bows and trampling through their 
experiments. Needless to say, in the 
future no group smaller than three 
will be allowed away from the 
base.’’ 

There were unhappy murmers but 
obviously it was a necessary precau- 
tion. Even so, a small group of 
diehards argued her down from 

136 



three to two in “special cases’’ be- 
fore they let her continue. 

“Very well.’’ Tarpi noticed that 
she looked harried. “Now, as I’m 
sure the grapevine has informed 
you, the two Chimps who were ac- 
companying Rodder — ’’ 

“You mean slaving for him,’’ 
someone shouted from three 
o’clock, low. 

“I meant what I said, Lessiline,’’ 
Allis responded with some asperity. 
“If the Chimps choose to accom- 
pany us and occasionally help with 
minor chores for their own reasons, 
that’s their business. But this expe- 
dition is in enough trouble without 
having unwarranted charges of slav- 
ery leveled, and I’ll thank you to 
keep silent. Now, you’re aware that 
Rodder’s Chimps are, at the very 
least, witnesses to the crime, and 
quite possibly a good deal more. 
They claim to have seen a human 
kill Rodder and they say they can 
identify him.’’ 

The crowd murmured protest. 
Everyone had known the Chimps 
were in the camp but had assumed 
their presence was for purposes of 
lynching. 

“So in a minute,’’ she continued, 
“I’m going to have one of them 
brought in to see if he can pick out 
the alleged culprit.’’ 

They protested even louder at 
that. “What about our rights?’’ 
someone shouted from the back. 

“I realize that technically this 
tramples on your rights, but I think 
this is the easiest way to settle the 
charges these two intelligent, legally 
responsible beings have made.’’ 
The emphasis on the legal catch- 
phrase was heavy. “I think the odds 
of each of them separately identify- 



GALAXY 




ing not only the same person, but 
someone who could reasonably have 
committed the crime, and who lacks 
an alibi, are negligible. And that 
failure will give us prima facie evi- 
dence to hold them and later re- 
move them from the planet for trial 
when the Ariel returns for us.” 

She nodded to Stamm, who fon- 
dled Marvel briefly. ‘‘We’re record- 
ing now,” she went on. ‘‘For the 
record, is there anyone here who 
objects to allowing the two Chimps 
named ‘Sodom’ and ‘Gomorrah’ to 
attempt this identification?” 

She waited for a moment, survey- 
ing the crowd. When nobody re- 
sponded, she nodded to Stamm 
again. 

He left the room and returned 
shortly with Sodom in tow. There 
was a low rumble accompanied by a 
slight tension in the room. Sodom 
gazed around at the group, his 
vaguely anthropomorphic features, 
plus his black velvet sonar receptor, 
giving him the emotionless expression 
of an executioner. He followed 
Stamm, a pace behind and one to 
the side, in a slow tour of the 
crowd, passing through them like a 
breeze, causing them to straighten 
before him and relax after his pas- 
sage. They finally returned to the 
start. 

‘‘Well?” said Allis. 

‘‘He is not here.” 

‘‘But this is all the humans there 
are on the planet. Are you sure?” 
‘‘Yes.” 

‘‘You still claim that you saw 
Rodder killed by a human, by one 
of us?” 

‘‘Yes.” 

‘‘But that human is not in this 
room?” 



‘‘Yes.” 

‘‘Could somebody have skipped 
out on us?” a small, stocky blonde 
girl asked. ‘‘You know, be hiding 
in the restroom or something?” 

‘‘Maybe you ought to have Mar- 
vel call the roll, hon,” Stamm said. 

So Marvel called the roll, twice, 
the second time with everyone 
walking past Sodom as his name 
was called. 

By the time Allis got to ‘‘Abram 
Willks” again, most of the crowd 
was rumbling angrily. They had 
been gathered here against their 
wills and it was late at night, and in 
spite of the fact that no one liked 
him very much. Rodder had been 
murdered, and they thought they 
knew by whom. They were ready 
for a little blood. 

‘‘All right, he’s had three 
chances. That ought to be enough to 
satisfy the record. I move we take 
him out and execute him.” A tall, 
thin man near the wall was waving 
his hand over his head. There were 
shouts of “Second” from a half- 
dozen people around the room. 

“I’m afraid you’re under a mis- 
apprehension, Heim,” Allis said. 
“This is not a stockholders’ meet- 
ing of this corporation, it’s a meet- 
ing of corporation employees. And 
as such, you’re in no position to 
make motions of any sort.” 

“Now just a minute, Madame 
Chairman — ’ ’ 

“No, Herm, not ‘Madame 
Chairman,’ ” Allis said sharply. 
“Right now I’m commander of this 
expedition, president of the corpora- 
tion, the sole ruler with absolute au- 
thority. I’m willing to listen to any 
reasonable discussion but the final 
decisions are entirely mine. And 



THE PURBLIND PEOPLE 



137 




immediate execution of this being is 
out of the question. Certainly it may 
be appropriate to hold him for trial 
aboard Ariel when she returns, but 
lynching him would be heinously 
immoral. It would merit not only 
fines but actual incarceration for us 
all. Or have you forgotten Epsilon 
Scorpio VI?” She looked out at 
them, her eyebrows raised in ques- 
tion. “All right, does anyone have 
any reasonable suggestion to 
offer?” 

“Gomorrah,” said Tarpi. 

“Certainly, our other witness. 
Stamm, will you please bring him 
in?” 

But Gomorrah’s performance dif- 
fered from Sodom’s in no signifi- 
cant detail. Yes he was sure a 
human had killed Rodder. No the 
human was not here. Yes he was 
sure cross my heart ma’am honest 
to gods. Stamm led him out again. 

It was all very unsatisfying; they 
had wanted a clear-cut solution, 
somebody to blame and punish so 
that they could get back to their 
work. Instead they had a story that 
was almost certainly a lie but im- 
possible to verify. And, oh, God, 
what if it were true? 

Their frustration turned on Allis. 
Why weren’t we issued guns to pro- 
tect ourselves from these little ver- 
min? There was no apparent reason 
for it. Besides, one gun won’t di- 
vide one hundred and seventeen 
ways. Why didn’t you call Ariel to 
pick us up as soon as this hap- 
pened? Impossible. Even if we 
could get a message to her, a star- 
ship’s time is scheduled so far 
ahead and is so valuable that liter- 
ally nothing can deflect it. Not even 
the lives of one hundred and sixteen 



people? You heard me. Had any- 
body thought to look at Rodder’s 
last films? I mean, maybe they 
show — We’re not fools. They show 
nothing, simply standard footage of 
ruggers and gryphons and whatnot. 

Could it be true, you know, what 
the Chimps said about another 
strange human on the planet? Sure, 
Herm. Somebody probably popped 
up in his private space yacht for the 
express purpose of bludgeoning 
Rodder to death. Why didn’t we 
think of that? Allis recognized that 
if she were tired enough to be sar- 
castic, nothing further was likely to 
be accomplished and so she maneu- 
vered them into small conversa- 
tional groups (“I want committee 
recommendations in the morning”) 
and went to bed. 

VIII 

They buried Rodder the next day, 
Stamm reading the service. There 
was no eulogy. Sodom and 
Gomorrah were held pending the ar- 
rival of Ariel, although there was 
considerable minority argument for 
releasing them. And work resumed 
as before. 

Or almost as before. For a while 
Chimps were banned from many 
camps as dangerous (or frightening) 
and their presence was unwelcome. 
But as time passed, their gentleness 
and eager curiosity let them diffuse 
once again into their old status. It 
was difficult to stay mad at them. 

Allis enforced her “no-solo- 
parties” rule. Tarpi pleaded special 
circumstances and drew the small, 
stocky blonde girl as his partner. 
Her name was lo Gallar and she 
was one of the film crew making 



138 



GALAXY 





nature movies of the local wildlife, 
the profits of which were intended 
to defray the cost of the expedition. 
The usual aloofness between film 
crew and scientific personnel stood 
between them for the first week and 
they played it very crisp and busi- 
nesslike. (“I’d appreciate it if you 
could stay away from the mound of 
shriekers down near the stream for a 
few days, Miss Gallar.” “Cer- 
tainly, Doctor Liddell.’’) 

Then one day Tarpi started 
whistling every time he saw her, 
repeating the same tune each time. 
It was a day and a half before she 
gave in and acknowledged it. 

“All right, I give up. What’s the 
song?’’ 

“Song? What song?’’ He was in- 
nocence itself. 

“The song you’ve been whistling 
for the past two days and which I’m 

THE PURBLIND PEOPLE 



obviously supposed to recognize.’’ 
“Oh, this song?’’ He whistled a 
few bars of it. 

“Yes, that song.” 

“An old Disney classic like that 
and you don’t recognize it?” He 
shook his head pityingly. “Your 
education is sorely lacking.” He 
broke into song; “lo, lo, its off to 
work we go. .” He got past 
three and a half bars before she hit 
him with a plastic plate — but not 
very hard. 

After that the tension between 
them melted and before long they 
had moved all the equipment into 
one tent and all the personnel into 
the other. And field work became 
much more pleasant. 

It was probably the reference to 
Disney that gave lo the idea she 
broached to Tarpi as they lay cud- 
dled spoonwise one night after mak- 

139 



ing love. 

“That was really great, Tarpi.” 

“You’re right.” He parodied 
smug self-satisfaction. 

“If we could only get it on film, 
we’d make a profit for sure, bond 
or no bond.” 

“Yeah . never get it past the 
Board of Prudes, though.” 

“Uh-huh . you know what a 
lot of the old-timers used to do?’ ’ 

“No, what?” 

“Well, they would sneak sex into 
their films. They’d get shots of 
bare-breasted native women, or 
animals mating, or being bom, and 
would slip it past the Board as edu- 
cational.” 

“Which it was. So?” 

“But mapy people thought it was 
dirty too. And it boosted sales a 
lot.” 

“Okay, so go out and get some 
pictures of ruggers or Chimps- 
Doing-It.” 

“Yes, I thought of that already 
but ruggers are no good. Even if 
you could get two of them outside 
the scrum to do anything but merely 
sit there, they would just look like a 
couple of furry beach-balls nuz- 
zling. Chimps would be perfect 
though, Taipi, except for one 
thing.” 

Tarpi was not totally insensitive. 
“Your spontaneity is showing. 
Okay, what is the one thing?” he 
asked. 

“Well, they have this law or 
taboo against public appearances, 
just like we have. But I finally 
talked Jeeves and Hester into it.” 
Jeeves was to lo as Hester was to 
Tarpi. “There’s a hitch though. I 
had to bid so high that their curios- 
ity got the better of them.” 



“What did you offer them, Am- 
brose Bierce’s current address?” 
“No, they want to watch us 
first.” 

“God, you mean they’ve been 
hiding in the comer all this time!” 
He clutched at the top of the sleep- 
ing bag. 

“No, stupid. But can we, Tarpi? 
I think it would add a lot to the 
film, and it wouldn’t do us any 
harm. It might even be kind of 
fun.” 

“Let me think for a min- 
ute .. okay, I guess so.” 

lo turned over and hugged him. 
“It’s not like they were really 
people. And it might be really great 
at that. How do you want to play 
it? Screaming, tearing rape — or 
slick, sly seduction?” 

“Well, that rape thing sounds 
sort of interesting but we’d better 
save that for later, I think. Where 
did you learn slick, sly seduction, 
anyway?” 

“Never mind.” 

“If you can’t show me any cre- 
dentials, then 1 guess we’ll just 
have to play it straight.” 

“Tomorrow night? ‘If it were 
done when ’tis done, then ’twere 
well it were done quickly,’ or how- 
ever the saying goes.” 

“Not always,” he replied. “But 
in this case I think that’s best.” 

IX 

The following night, it were 
done. Afterward Tarpi, still frisky, 
looked over at the two Chimps in 
the shadows and asked, “Well, 
Hester, how was it?” lo elbowed 
him in the ribs. 

“It was interesting.” 



140 



GALAXY 




“Interesting how?” he pursued. 
“It’s always a good idea to get dif- 
ferent points of view,” he whis- 
pered aside to lo. 

“Sex makes you both look very 
strange for a time.” 

“Look strange how? . Ouch, 
stop that, you’re giving me a bruise 
there.” 

Hester paused for a moment. 
“Very strange.” 

Tarpi leaned back and looked 
thoughtful. lo answered the 
Chimps’ remaining questions and 
then sent them out. She looked over 
at Tarpi. 

“If I get you a cigarette, will you 
lie there and blow smoke up at the 
ceiling pensively?” 

He ignored her question. “lo, de- 
scribe me.” 

“Why?” 

“Just do it.” 

“Well, you’re fairly good- 
looking, maybe six feet tall, sort of 
skinny, reddish-brown hair, brown 
eyes, and you have a sinister- 
looking scar on the bridge of your 
nose. Close enough?” 

“From a description like that, 
someone could probably pick me 
out from the rest of the expedition, 
at least. Now how many of the 
characteristics you listed would a 
Chimp list?” 

“Everything except hair and eye 
color, probably.” 

“No, think about it. The Chimps 
have no standard with which to de- 
cide whether I’m as handsome as I 
actually am or as ugly as a dried 
prune. There’s nobody on the ex- 
pedition who’s grossly fat or thin — ” 
“I love you for that.” 

“ — or thin, so the Chimps have 
no standard for comparison there 



either. And as for my sabre scar — ” 
“I still say it was probably a 
broken beer sphere.” 

“ — I don’t think they even see it. 
Look, they all broadcast their sonar 
sound on a frequency of about thirty 
thousand cycles, which gives a 
wavelength of, um, about a cen- 
timeter or so. They just plain can’t 
see anything much smaller than 
that. No sabre scar. Hell, they’re 
probably hard-pressed to jnake out 
any features at all. The most they 
could ‘see’ of me would be ‘a man, 
six feet tall.’ And you got that 
wrong anyway. I’m only five-ten.” 
“I know, I was trying to boost 
your ego.” 

“Liar. But that’s why their towns 
and their art seem so crummy to us. 
Once they have all the irregularities 
down to less than a centimeter or 
so, everything ‘looks’ okay to them 
despite the fact that it still looks un- 
finished to us. But anyway, the point 
is, why did Hester say sex made us 
look ‘strange?’ ” 
lo suggested a possiblity. 

“That’s ignoble. Besides, she 
said both of us.” 

“Yes, and she could have de- 
scribed it anyway. But I see what 
you mean. If all they can resolve of 
us is sort of human-shaped blurs, 
we must look pretty much the same 
to them all the time. But, Tarpi, if 
that’s true, how can they tell them- 
selves apart? Or us apart, for that 
matter? I’ve never had one call me 
by the wrong name.” 

“I know what you mean. And 
you’re right. Since they can’t see 
each other’s green blotches, they 
ought to look pretty much alike to 
each other . .no, wait. Sonar. 
They can probably tell themselves 



THE PURBLIND PEOPLE 



141 




apart by voice, and us too, for that 
matter.” 

‘‘No good,” lo said. ‘‘They all 
use the same frequency — thirty-six 
thousand, two hundred forty-three 
point six cycles. I remember 
Herm’s telling me about it and 
laughing. It’s an organic crystal res- 
onance or something. When they 
talk to us, we hear a subharmonic.” 
‘‘But that wouldn’t prevent them 
from telling us apart by voice,” 
Tarpi countered. 

‘‘And it wouldn’t make us look 
‘strange’ during sex. Voiceprints 
are supposed to be as constant as 
fingerprints.” 

‘‘You know, ‘very strange’ is 
also how Sodom described Rodder’s 
murderer,” Tarpi mused. 

‘‘That’s not too surprising; they 
don’t have many descriptors to work 
with. Either we look like we 
usually do or we look ‘very 
strange.’ ” 

‘‘But, lo, what do lovers and 
murderers have in common that 
make them both look ‘very strange’ 
to a Chimp? Seriously.” 

She shrugged. ‘‘I don’t know. 
They both might be excited or 
scared in some circumstances but a 
Chimp certainly couldn’t see that. 
Or maybe. .” 

Tarpi sat up. ‘‘Couldn’t they?” 
‘‘Well, no. I thought we had de- 
cided they couldn’t make out any- 
thing as fine as facial expressions.” 
‘‘Listen ... a few weeks ago, 
just before we found Rodder’s 
body, we flew over a scrum of rug- 
gers, Hester, Stamm and I. We 
were almost on top of them, just a 
few hundred meters away, but Hes- 
ter couldn’t see them.” 

‘‘Of course not. The flitter dome 



doesn’t transmit sound, only light.” 
‘‘Exactly. But she could see a 
group of Chimps better than two 
klicks away.” 

‘‘That’s a pretty good trick.” 

‘‘If she were sonaring them, it 
would be. But what if she were see- 
ing them mentally, with empathy 
or telepathy or something like 
that?” 

‘‘That’s sort of far-fetched, even 
coming from you.” 

‘‘Yes, but it’s beautiful, it ex- 
plains everything,” he said ex-, 
citedly. ‘‘She can’t sense the rug- 
gers’ presence because they have no 
more brains than a retarded cab- 
bage, but the Chimps’ presence 
would show up like ants on a plate. 
And a person in an orgasm or a kill- 
ing rage would look grossly 
different — mentally, that is — than 
the usual human. They would both 
look ‘very strange.’ And they are.” 
‘‘Maybe so . and you know 
how every Chimp you meet always 
seems to know your name. That 
could be telepathy too.” 

‘‘I always thought we were being 
supersonically introduced, but you 
could be right. Although I don’t 
think it can really be telepathy. 
Maybe it’s more like empathy. If 
they were well-developed telepaths, 
they wouldn’t need a language, and 
they certainly have one.” 

‘‘They wouldn’t be very curious 
either. They’d be able to pick what- 
ever they wanted straight out of 
your minds.” 

‘‘Uh-huh, except maybe it 
doesn’t work very well with hu- 
mans. Different wavelength or 
something. I bet that’s why they 
don’t eat meat any more too. Sirloin 
steak wouldn’t be so attractive if

you had to suffer the death agony of 
the steer before you ate it. They 
don’t have ethics, they’re just 
chicken.” 

“A Chimp couldn’t have killed 
Rodder then, either. I mean if they 
really are empathetic.” 

‘‘Of course it’s true, it has to 
be.” 

‘‘Well, with the weight of your 
assertion, plus some wild specula- 
tion to back it up. I’m sure you’ll 
have no trouble in finding con- 
verts.” 

‘‘Okay, doubting lo, I’ll prove it 
to you.” He sat up again and 
shouted into the tent flap: “Hester, 
hey, Hester, come here a minute.” 
He turned to lo. “Sit up a second, 
will you darling.” 

Jeeves put his head through the 
tent opening. “Hester is not here 
Tarpi.” 

“That’s okay, Jeeves. Come in 
here for a minute. I want you to 
look at something.” 

He slapped lo’s face stingingly. 

“Why, you goddam dirty 
... oh ... I see. Very clever, 
you louse.” lo rubbed the red 
handprint on her cheek, still three- 
quarters mad. 

“Darling, I humbly and abjectly 
beg your forgiveness. You don’t 
know how sorry I am I had to do 
that.” 

“Okay, Just don’t make a habit 
of it. Arid don’t forget that I owe 
you one — a big one. Jeeves, did I 
look different to you Just then when 
Tarpi slapped me?” 

“Yes lo.” 

“Different that I usually do?” 

“Yes.” 

lo leaned back. “Well, that’s in- 
dicative at least.” 



“Indicative, hell,” Tarpi said. 
“Jeeves, how long a time did lo 
look different?” 

“A very short time Tarpi.” 

“Just immediately after 1 slapped 
her?” 

“Yes.” 

“How did she look then?” 

Jeeves paused. “Very strange.” 
“Did she look the same as when 
she looked strange during sex?” 
“No.” 

“How was it different?” 

Jeeves paused for a long time. “I 
do not know words for it Tarpi.” 
“Okay, Jeeves, you can leave 
now.” He leaned back beside lo 
and looked at her. “You see?” 
“Well, it seems likely ... I 
wonder why they never mentioned 
it.” 

“Did we ever think to tell them 
that they all look alike to us except 
for the patterns of green on their lit- 
tle yellow bodies? It would have 
been about as meaningful as their 
telling us that your psyche gets all 
mimsy when you’re mad. Besides, it 
was so obvious that probably none 
of them ever thought of it.” 

“I wonder what we really look 
like to them,” lo mused. “If you 
don’t use sight but sonar and em- 
pathy, or whatever it is, I mean.” 
“Probably mimsy, with patches 
of grell, shading to demi-grell, de- 
pending on mood. Which is to say 
that we’ll never know.” 

“Depending on mood? Oh, 
Tarpi — Sodom and Gomorrah! They 
may have been telling the truth.” 
“Well, sure. The first time they 
saw the murderer he was mad 
enough or frightened enough to kill. 
The next time he was probably in a 
rational state. He ‘looked’ com- 



THE PURBLIND PEOPLE 



143 




pletely different to them.” 

“But that means that one of us 
really did kill Rodder. It wasn’t just 
a story the Chimps made up.” 

“You didn’t think Sodom or 
Gomorrah did it, did you?” 

“I guess I did, kind of. I mean, 
it was better than . who do you 
think did it?” 

“I don’t know. But maybe if we 
ask in the right way, we can get 
Sodom and Gomorrah to tell us.” 

X 

The flitter was full. Allis and 
Stamm occupied the two front seats; 
Tarpi and lo were in the back, 
Sodom and Gomorrah on their laps. 
Crouched in the small space in the 
rear was Lessiline. Allis had tried to 
persuade Stamm to rig the cargo net 
underneath for the two Chimps to 
tide in but he had declined — unless 
Allis wanted to ride there too. She 
did not. 

They flew at low altitude toward 
a scarlet sunset, the humans aboard 
concentrating their attention on the 
scribble of yellowish-green rugger 
trails that tangled the prairie below. 

“Hurry it up, will you, Stamm,” 
said Lessiline. “I’m about to freeze 
in an obscene position back here.” 

“Should be just a couple more 
minutes. Less. In that little grove 
just ahead.” 

The “little grove” was dense 
with roundheels, thrashing and writh- 
ing wildly in a stiff breeze. Three 
small hemispherical orange tents 
were occasionally visible through 
gaps in the trees, their dayglo color 
catching the eye like the blink of a 
lighthouse. The flitter made a low 
pass over the scrum of ruggers, 



flushing a brace of humans as it did 
so, and landed at the edge of the 
grove near the camp. 

Humans and Chimps piled out 
and then watched with amusement 
as Lessiline ostentatiously unstiff- 
ened each joint and creakily clam- 
bered down. She seemed to have 
aged fifty years during the eight- 
minute flight. 

One of the humans they had 
flushed angrily pounded up to them. 
“What the hell do you damn fools 
think you’re doing?” 

“Now hold it a minute, Ard — ” 
Stamm began. 

“ ‘Hold it’ nothing. We work all 
day trying to get that scrum quies- 
cent and then just when we’ve fi- 
nally got ’em settled down, zoom! 
along comes Tom Swift and His 
Flying Noisemaker. Thanks a lot. 
Thanks a hell of a lot.” 

“C’mon, Ard, you can’t even 
hear that thing fifty meters away,” 
Stamm went to the flitter’s defense. 

“Tell it to the ruggers.” 

“Okay, I’m sorry, I apologize. 
All right?” 

“Hell of a lot of good that 
does.” Ard was not going to be 
mollified. 

“Standing here arguing about it 
doesn’t do much good either, does 
it?” Allis asked impatiently. “Ard, 
we need to see Janos. Where is 
he?” 

“What for?” 

“Never mind what for,” she said 
evenly. “Just show us where he is, 
please.” 

Ard looked half angry, half curi- 
ous. “Through there.” He pointed 
toward the edge of the grove. “Go 
a few hundred meters through the 
trees and you’ll come out into a big 



144 



GALAXY 




patch of cottonweed. He’s out in 
the middle of it with a nest of 
mousies.” 

“Show us, will you please?’’ 

“Can’t. Have to help Adda with 
the ruggers.’’ He was getting even 
with them. “But just keep going 
straight ahead. You can’t miss it.’’ 
He turned away and then looked 
back over his shoulder. “And when 
you leave, take off over the grove, 
will you? Not over the ruggers.” 
He hurried off. 

The slow sunset filled the grove 
with long shadows and red light, 
and the bobbing treetops held their 
peripheral vision, pestering them 
with warnings of unnamed horrors 
leaping on them from the darkness. 
They trudged along in single file, 
silent except for the moment when a 
treetop swept too close to lo. She 
jumped and then cursed herself too 
loudly. (“Take it easy, you fool. 
That tree hasn’t bitten anyone in 
weeks.”) 

It seemed farther than “a few 
hundred meters” but eventually the 
trees thinned and they reached the 
patch of cottonweed. It was in full 
bloom, a total undercast stained 
bloody red by the last bite of the 
setting sun. 

Janos was a few dozen meters 
away, wading slowly toward them, 
submerged almost up to his hips in 
the dense brush. The sun illumi- 
nated his left side redly; his right 
side was deeply shadowed. As he 
came out of the cottonweed in front 
of them, the sun slipped below the 
horizon, the shadows vanished and 
the long, dim twilight began. 

Janos dumped his load of equip- 
ment at their feet. He was a small 
man, about fifty years old, in good 



condition. His manner was a shade 
too hearty. “Well, well. Stamm. 
Allis. Tarpi. Less. lo, isn’t it?” He 
nodded at each in turn; his glance 
slid over the two Chimps. “To 
what do 1 owe this honor?” 

“We’d like to talk to you about 
Rodder,” Allis said. 

“Rodder? Well, all right, if you 
want. Although I must say. I’ve al- 
ways found it better to heed the Bib- 
lical injunction to let the dead past 
bury its dead. Let’s walk back to 
camp while we talk, shall we?” 

He hefted his load and started off 
into the dimness. Allis walked be- 
side him. 

“That’s Longfellow,” Tarpi sud- 
denly said. “ ‘Let the dead past 
bury its dead’ isn’t Biblical, it’s 
from Longellow.” 

“Quite so,” said Janos. “Now 
then, Allis, you wanted to talk 
about Rodder. Am I correct an as- 
suming that those two (a thumb 
over the shoulder indicated Sodom 
and Gomorrah) are the culprits re- 
sponsible for his death?” 

Allis ignored his question. “How 
did you feel about Rodder, Janos?” 
“Much the same as everyone 
else, I think. With years of study at 
the foot of a saint, Rodder could 
possibly have achieved the moral 
standards of a swine.” 

“And how did you feel when he 
died?” 

“Well, I—” 

“Hon, this isn’t getting us any- 
where,” Stamm interrupted. “Get 
to the point.” 

“Perhaps that would be just as 
well, Allis,” Janos agreed. “Just 
what is the point of all this?” 

“All right, Janos.” She took a 
breath. “Before he was transported 



THE PURBLIND PEOPLE 



145 




to his new field site on the day he 
was killed, Rodder had been work- 
ing out of base camp for a while. 
Stamm and I put our heads to- 
gether, and our recollections — plus 
a lot of help from various records 
stored in Marvel — indicate that 
Rodder was at base for six days and 
that during that time twenty-one 
other expedition members were also 
there for varying periods.” 

“And I was one of the twenty- 
one. So were you. So was Stamm. 
So what?” 

She ignored him. “Only those 
twenty-one people could have 
known where Rodder was going to 
set up his new camp. We had Mar- 
vel examine the data stored by each 
of them on the day Rodder was 
killed, November ninth. Of the 
twenty-one sixteen showed typical 
input during the day, including 
notetapes. The voiceprints are veri- 
fiable, of course. Of the remaining 
five, three showed no input at all 
for the day. They were Vicktor and 
his cohorts, taking the day off at 
Ramshom Lake. Wardal didn’t 
show any input either but she had 
filmed some scenes the previous 
day. The terrain is quite identifi- 
able; it’s her site, all right — ninety- 
two klicks from where Rodder was 
killed.” 

“That makes twenty, I believe. I, 
presumably, am the twenty-first,” 
Janos said. 

“Yes. Your records for the day 
show only a small segment of very 
bad film of a shrieker mound. The 
light was almost gone. Portions are 
even a little out of focus. It was 
eleven klicks from your camp to 
Rodder’s, an easy three-hour hike in 
most circumstances, but you must 

146 



have misgauged it, what with hav- 
ing to swing around to come and go 
from a different direction. It must 
have been frightening — hurrying, 
hurrying, racing the sqn, trying to 
get back in time to take the film 
that would establish your alibi. And 
you just didn’t quite make it.” 
“Allis, I would resent that ac- 
cusation more than I can say if I 
didn’t feel so very sorry for you. It’s 
obvious that you’ve let your sym- 
pathy for those two Chimps warp 
your Judgment so severely that 
you’ll contrive a circumstantial case 
against one of your own people in 
order to free them.” He shook his 
head sadly. 

“I’m afraid it’s a good deal more 
than circumstance, Janos. There are 
two witnesses against you.” 

“Indeed!” He stopped walking. 
“And who would they be?” 

“Sodom and Gomorrah.” 
“Excellent, excellent. Very good 
choices. The two murderers have 
now, under no doubt expert coach- 
ing, searched their memories and 
discovered that despite failing to 
recognize me the first three times 
they saw me, I am nonetheless the 
man they saw kill Rodder.” He 
turned to confront the Chimps. “Is 
that right? Do you now claim that 
you saw me kill Rodder?” 

“No Janos,” Sodom said. 

“No,” Gomorrah echoed. 

“No?” He was taken aback. 
“What is this, Allis? Those two 
don’t accuse me.” 

“I should have explained. Tarpi 
has discovered that the Chimps are 
highly sensitive to the emotional 
states of other beings and that in 
fact they identify us largely on, uh, 
how our minds ‘look’ to them. 



GALAXY 




When they saw you kill Rodder, 
you were in the grip of some very 
strong emotion. You had to be, to 
commit murder. Apparently the 
other times they saw you, when 
they tried to identify the murderer 
back at base, you were calmer and 
so you looked different to them. 
You’re a very cool man, Janos. 
Usually.” 

“Be serious, Allis. I’d as lief be- 
lieve the entrails of a chicken as 
that story.” 

“We’ve tested them in several 
ways. Their ability is quite real. 
Quite repeatable, too, with a given 
person, although different people 
appear to change differently for the 
same emotion. Really very interest- 
ing. But what we would like 
you to do is to allow Lessiline, 
here, to regress you under hypnosis 
to the day Rodder was killed. In 
that way your mental state will du- 
plicate your mental state when 
Sodom and Gomorrah saw you kill 
Rodder, and they’ll be able to iden- 
tify you. In addition — ” 

“That’s quite out of the question, 
Allis.” 

“I was afraid it probably would 
be. Go!” 

Tarpi and Stamm grabbed for 
Janos’s arms. Tarpi got a firm grip 
but Janos saw Stamm coming, 
grabbed the front of his tunic as he 
ran forward and pulled him along 
into the underbrush. Then he went 
for Tarpi’s eyes with his free hand. 

But he was outnumbered. lo 
grabbed his hand just as Allis 
kicked the backs of his knees, caus- 
ing him to crumple to the ground. 
Tarpi and lo fell on him and then 
Lessiline — who had been dancing 
around looking for an opening — 

THE PURBLIND PEOPLE 



leaned in and injected him in the 
neck. Janos stopped struggling as 
though he had been pole-axed. 

“Damn! Is it supposed to do 
that?” Tarpi asked as he scrambled 
to his feet. 

“It’s usual,” said Lessiline. 
“He’ll be a little livelier in a min- 
ute or two.” 

“Stamm, dear, you were out of 
position,” Allis said as her husband 
rejoined them. 

“Yes, I know,” he said shortly, 
looking down at Janos lying on the 
ground. 

“It should be any second now,” 
Lessiline said. 

Janos screamed — a piercing, hor- 
rifying, animal sound. 

“There you go. Classic reac- 
tion.” 

“How can you sound so self- 
satisfied, Less?” lo asked. 

Janos began to writhe, alternately 
raging loudly and then gibbering 
softly to himself. 

“Hush, children,” Allis ordered. 
She turned to Sodom and Gomorrah 
and stated formally: “Sodom, 

Gomorrah, I ask you now in the 
presence of these witnesses if the 
man you saw kill Rodder is here.” 

“Yes Allis the man on the 
ground,” said Sodom. 

“Yes,” said Gomorrah. 

“Which one, Gomorrah?” Allis 
pursued. 

“The one on the ground.” 

“You see,” said Stamm. “I told 
you it had to be anger. Janos was 
never afraid of anything in his 
life.” 

“Okay,” Allis said impatiently. 
“Is everyone clear now on whom 
the Chimps have identified and 
what they identify him as having 

147 




done? Does anyone want to ask any 
questions?” 

No one did. They stood in silence 
for several minutes, watching Janos 
rage, each thinking his own 
thoughts. Then they were suddenly 
distracted by thrashing noises and a 
flickering light in the grove behind 
them. It was Ard, waving a 
flashlight. The darkness had crept 
up on them and the light was wel- 
come. 

‘‘What the hell are you idiots up 
to now? What’s all the screaming 
about? Jesus Christ! What hap- 
pened to himl" 

‘‘Minimal dose of Schillizide,” 
Lessiline said. ‘‘He’ll come out of 
it in a few minutes.” 

‘‘Schillizide? What the hell’s 
that?” 

‘‘A psychotomimetic.” She saw 
that he looked blank. ‘‘A drug. It 
produces a condition indistinguisha- 
ble from intense, psychotic rage.” 

‘‘Why did he tice that?” 

‘‘He didn’t,” Allis said. ‘‘We 
gave it to him.” 

‘‘Huh?” 

“Help us carry him back and I’ll 
explain.” 

XI 

Janos decided to open his eyes. 
He lay on his back, the orange 
hemisphere of the tent over his head 
softly illuminated by a light beyond 
his range of vision. Lessiline looked 
down at him. 

“About time you woke up. You 
were making me look bad.” Her 
tone was carefully neutral. 

“I’ve been conscious for some 
time . where is everyone else?” 
He rolled suddenly to his feet, 

148 



crouching under the low dome. 

Lessiline backed up warily. 
“Outside.” 

He went through the tent flap. It 
was dark now, a canopy of stars 
overhead. People were circled 
around a low fire, the Chimps hov- 
ered farther back in the shadows. 
A hundred meters beyond, light 
flashed occasionally as Adda went 
about her arcane duty with the rug- 
gers. 

Allis looked up at him. “Sodom 
and Gomorrah identified you, 
Janos, while you were uncon- 
scious.” 

“I know. I heard most of what 
you told Ard. It would be easy for 
me to fight the charge, Allis. A 
judge would never allow a defend- 
ant to be drugged like that and 
your Chimps could never identify 
me in court. And your testimony 
would be merely hearsay.” 

“Are you going to fight, Janos?” 
Allis asked. 

He sagged. “No ... it would be 
easiest for me to resist, every in- 
stinct tells me to . but it would 
be futile.” He sat and stared into 
the fire. “I’ve been doomed ever 
since you became convinced that 
those two were telling the truth. 
Forgetting about his Chimps — that 
was incredibly stupid of me. In ret- 
rospect, I see that I planned the 
whole adventure rather badly. Now 
that you’ve had confirmation of 
your conclusions, you’ll have little 
trouble compiling other evidence 
against me. I could fight if I 
wished, drag myself and Ae whole 
expedition through the muck of a 
public trial ... but I won’t.” 

“Do you want to tell us why you 
did it?” Allis asked gently. 



GALAXY 




“No, I don’t. It’s an ugly story 
and reflects no credit on me. But I 
suppose I must say something. 
Suffice it to say that while Rodder 
and I were both at base camp, he 
was responsible for my becoming 
quite fiermanently addicted to a 
rather unpleasant compound found 
in an infusion of ohhell weed. It re- 
sults in a loss of inhibition and con- 
trol which I find intolerable. 1 could 
not, I was unable, to let him go un- 
punished. The rest is as you have 
surmised, save that I did not mis- 
gauge the time required for the 
journey to his camp; I simply lost 
my way and wandered for some 
hours on the prairie. , . Well!’’ 

He straightened briskly and 
looked around at the group, staring 
each in the eyes for a brief instant. 
“I don’t suppose one of you has a 
gentlemanly pistol? I thought not. 



Ah, well. But what a gesture.’’ 

He rose and started out into the 
darkness. Stamm stood up and 
moved to block his path. 

“Let him go, Stamm,’’ Allis 
said. Her voice sounded tired. 

“But, hon — ’’ 

“Let him go.’’ , 

Stamm moved aside. Janos 
walked out into the darkness, his 
head erect, his step measured. 
When he reached the edge of the 
scrum of ruggers, he paused for a 
brief moment, then took three run- 
ning steps and dived headfirst into 
them. TTiey started to boil vigor- 
ously. 

Sodom and Gomorrah screamed 
— a long, mournful note. The hu- 
mans rose and started toward the 
flitter. What was happening in the 
scrum behind them, they did not 
want to see. ★

SINCE the writings of Jules Verne and 
H. G. Wells, science fiction— often 
termed "future fiction"— has fasci- 
nated alert minds. Not only has it 
entertained, it has predicted much of 
the far-ranging scientific and social 
change now upon us. 

In GALAXY, the finest authors of 
the genre continue to speculate, to 
predict, to tackle the prime problems 
already shaping tomorrow. Ecology- 
space exploration— nuclear prorhise 
and threat— energy— social evolution 
and biological revolution— these and 
other fields are probed by imaginative 
stories uniquely exciting and reward- 
ing. So let your fancy run free. Sub-

1 LIKED LAURENCE Yep’s Seade- 
mons very much. What did 1 like 
most about it? Listen: 

At first he had hoped that 
going to the rectory [school] 
would help her to adjust, but 
after the trouble with Radog the 
Anglic knew he would have to 

151 



try to “humanize” her — as he 
called it — by himself. 

For their own sake, the Anglic 
took Maeve more and more into 
the wild. They wandered through 
the forests and the mountains far 
to the east along the northern 
seas. He showed her everything 
that was strange and wonderful 
and beautiful about Fancyfree 
[their planet] in the hope that she 
would come to love her new 
world. He showed her the star 
trees, and the paradise birds with 
wings like rainbows and voices 
like angels, and the giant spider 
webs that the winds sang 
through. Hunters would cross 
their path occasionally and bring 
back reports that both the Anglic 
and his creature looked well. 

Or: 

“It was already growing dark 
in the Wailing Mountains, 
and the sharp-pointed rocks made 
strange, teeth-like shadows 
which grew on either side as if 
jaws were closing about our 
shadows. There was a strange, 
lifeless silence here where noth- 
ing grew, though sometimes 
we would hear the high, lonely 
keening wind that gave the 
mountains their name. It was as 
if we had stumbled over the edge 
of the world into some strange 
limbo of the dead, for the Eyes 
in the wintertime were nothing 
like in the spring.” 

There is no greater delight for a 
reviewer than to pick up a new 
book by a new writer and to find 
that he or she is a bright new talent. 

152 



Not someone who is simply 
“promising,” whose technical 
clumsiness one feels obliged to 
apologize for in the hopes of better 
things to come, but someone who 
emerges in the top ranks of 
storytellers with his or her first 
book. Such a writer is Laurence 
Yep. 

He was bom in San Francisco 
and got his doctorate in literature 
from the State University of New 
York at Buffalo. He published his 
first story “The Selchey Kids,” in 
If, and it was selected as one of the 
best of the year 1969. Since then he 
has written three children’s books, 
Sweetwater, Child of the Owl, and 
Dragonwings, the last of which was 
a Newberry Honor Book. If I had 
the time, I would read them im- 
mediately, for I suspect Yep’s 
juveniles would appeal as much to 
fantasy-reading adults as to kids. 

Certainly, Seademons is a must. 

I hesitate to tell the story because 
the pleasure of the book is not the 
story, but the telling, and just to re- 
count the events will distort the 
truth of the narrative quality of it. 

It takes place on the primitive 
world of Fancyfree where we find a 
colony of humans who have fled a 
super-race called the “Fair Folk” to 
find freedom on a world where they 
will not be second-class citizens. 

Before they left, their leader. Da, 
had them set down all they could 
remember of their former lives, so 
they would not forget. Naturally, 
some things were lost in translation, 
as they call their original home 
“Tara” instead of “Terra,” and 
their homes “dooms” instead of 
domes. Also, in leaving civilization, 
they have lost much of the 

galaxy 




technological know-how of the Fair 
Folk; and what they have left, di- 
ving suits and robots and a single 
great computer, will not last 
forever. Already they are slipping 
back into a more primitive lifestyle, 
becoming superstitious and warlike. 
Their leaders, then, are faced with a 
race against time to establish at 
least a pre-nuclear industrial society 
before the last of the gadgets breaks 
down. 

Now, I know this sounds famil- 
iar, but it is really just background 
material covered in a few pages. 
The story begins from there. 

The heroine (in every sense of 
the word) is Ciaran, daughter of the 
Lord of the Holding. She and her 
half-brother, heir to the Lord, are 
sent to investigate the possible pres- 
ence of another intelligent life-form 
on Fancyfree. At the edge of the 
sea, they witness the emergence of 
aliens which steal a robot and leave 
a small girl in its place. 

Is she human? Should they risk 
taking her back to the holding, or 
should they kill her? 

They decide to take her back, and 
she becomes the ward of the hold- 
ing’s surly, staunchly individualistic 
artisan, the Anglic, who comes to 
love her as his daughter. 

From the beginning, “Maeve,” 
as they call her, does not fit in. She 
still speaks the language of the 
aliens who left her; and she seems 
to have other strange talents as 
well, one of which includes talking 
to “seademons,” those huge, 
squid-like monsters whom all men 
fear. 

Time and again, she is denounced 
as a witch and, finally driven from 
the holding. Twice young men fall

in love with her, only to meet mis- 
fortune. And what she does with 
her first-born, son of the heir-appar- 
ent to the Lord of the Holding, re- 
sults in war between the humans 
and the seademons. 

The story is told from Ciaran’s 
point of view. The mystery is who, 
and what, is Maeve. The real aliens 
in the book are not the seademons, 
but the humans themselves. 

The characters are outstanding. 
The whole action of the novel 
hinges on their obstinate humanity 
rather than outside influences. They 
refuse to understand or accept 
Maeve as she refuses to understand 
or accept them, and this is the 
theme of the book: humanity’s un- 
willingness to live and let live — to 
fear and to try to subdue, or to de- 
stroy, whatever it cannot under- 
stand. It is familiar, but as Yep pre- 
sents it, it is devastating. 

The story begins abruptly with 
the appearance of Maeve, and then 
settles down into a liesurely style 
whose tone is fantasy-like. Things 
happen, but there is little dramatic 
impetus until the last half of the 
book, although none of it is dull for 
a moment. Some readers may be 
confused, or even bored, if they 
miss the point of what Yep is 
doing, for he is building his narra- 
tive on several levels at once. For a 
while, it seems the story is about 
the humans. Da, Ciaran, and her 
half-brother Athvel; then it is about 
Maeve again, then the seadernons. 
Only gradually does Yep weave all 
the strands together in one thrilling 
cfimax. And the overall dramatic 
effect of the book is gentle and 
fairy-tale-like rather than violent 
and adventurous. But once he has 



achieved the climax, the thematic 
impact is powerful. 

Some, like myself, may get pret- 
ty exasperated with the humans, 
who can be nble and obtuse at the 
same time. Ciaran is the worst of 
all. So brilliant and sensitive and 
perceptive, but when she tries to 
settle things with Maeve, her ar- 
ticulateness leaves everything to be 
desired. But Maeve and her friends 
are really just as bad, as Yep points 
out. 

Still, while 1 don’t argue the truth 
of Yep’s theme, I did not find it 
convincing as he presented it, for 
the reasons stated in the last para- 
graph. Ciaran is just too good to be 
true. And her relations with her 
father are just a bit cute. 

Yep has tried to create a heroine 
who is every bit the equal of her 
burly male peers, and an intellectual 
to boot; while at the same time, 
leaving her recognizable as an at- 
tractive young girl whom men fuss 
over. He almost brought it off, but 
only almost. 

1 was also not wholly convinced 
of the humans’ regression into 
superstition, their eagerness to be- 
lieve Maeve a witch. Primitive 
superstitions were aspects of primi- 
tive religion. They did not arise 
spontaneously, and they were sup- 
ported by the upper classes and the 
church. This is not the case on Fan- 
cy free. 

But even as I write these criti- 
cisms, I can think of arguments that 
contradict them. And although they 
limit the book, they do not harm it 
much. Seademons is a fine novel, 
with, 1 should add, a fine cover 
painting by Frank Frazetta, and I 
recommend it absolutely.

The John W. Cabal Awards 

If anyone else but George R.R. 
Martin had edited New Voices in 
Science Fiction, 1 never would have 
read it. The title alone made me 
want to take a long walk in the 
country. And the subtitle, “Six 
Stories by Campbell Award 
Nominees,” compelled me to open 
every window in the house despite 
the sub-freezing temperatures out- 
side. But I’m a Martin fan. 1 trusted 
him. Oh, George, how could you 
treat me this way? 

Of the six stories in the book, I 
read three, two of them willingly, 
and made painful attempts to read 
the others, none of which were suc- 
cessful. I know critics are not sup- 
posed to say (admit? confess?) 
things like that, but there is a kind 
of sf that destroys every last vestige 
of enthusiasm I have for the genre 
and sends me like a refugee to the 
television set; and almost invariably, 
it is to be found in anthologies with 
“award” in the title. 

I did succeed in one case, Lisa 
Tuttle’s “The Family Monkey.” It 
revived an old fantasy of mine. I 
see myself as a teacher of creative 
writing, and someone like Tuttle 
has just handed in her manuscript, 
and I am filled with admiration. 
Such intelligence, sensitivity, and 
ability. A kid, and yet already she 
shows first-rate professional talent. 
What fine, clear prose; what consci- 
entious character development; what 
attention to detail. I mark the paper 
“A” and pin it up on the bulletin 
board. 



Then, I blink. I am back in my 
room with the story in the book 
before me. I am not a teacher, 1 am 
a reader. And the story I am read- 
ing is boring me out of my gourd. 

1 shift about anxiously. There is a 
tight knot in my gut. I hate it. But 
why? How can anyone hate any- 
thing in which he finds so much 
to admire? 

Is it badly written? Hardly, by 
the most acceptable definitions of 
bad writing. But then what is good 
writing? One expect^^ and almost 
always gets, some sense of propor- 
tion in these things; the quality of 
the writing being in proportion to 
the quality of what is being written 
about. Consequently, a reviewer 
needs simply to quote a few lines 
to demonstrate the inferiority or 
superiority of both form and con- 
tent. But in an increasing amount of 
sf it is no longer that easy. The kids 
have learned all the tricks, they 
know how to push all the buttons 
marked “literature.” So what 
comes out looks and sounds very 
good, but reads very badly. 

Lisa Tuttle’s story is about a 
Texas family that adopts a marooned 
alien who becomes something spe- 
cial (or horrible) to each member of 
the family. It is an old idea, a sim- 
ple idea, but she takes about forty- 
seven pages to tell it, and they read 
like something out of Good House- 
keeping. 

There are effective moments, 
especially the scene between Emily 
and her father, but nothing amounts 
to anything more dramatically sub- 
stantial than another episode of The 
Waltons; for here, as there, senti- 
mentality undermines the human re- 
ality.

And here, as in the stories by 
Robert Thurston, Ruth Berman, and 
George Alec Effinger, there is not a 
moment of wonder. Not a moment 
of possibility. Let me illustrate what 
I mean by quoting their first sen- 
tences; 

Tuttle: “I was sitting with Florrie 
on the porch of her Daddy’s house, 
watching the night get darker and 
wondering about making a move.” 
Thurston: “Thomason first met 
Ludvik in 1953, on an unusually 
cold August day.” 

Berman: “The U’s Miniver 

Cheevy Club’s fall jousting went off 
well.” 

Effinger: “Les Gruen had a small 
cubicle for an office, a long walk 
from the elevators.” 

Now, let me quote the first sen- 
tences of the stories I liked: 

Martin: “The crossworlds had a 
thousand names.” 

Pournelle: “Eight thousand young 
bodies writhed to the maddening 
beat of an electronic bass.” 

Were I a teacher of creative 
writing, 1 would have a long talk 
with Martin and Pournelle. 
“Gegrge, you worry me. You don’t 
seem to be getting much out of this 
course. Character, George. That’s 
what fiction is all about. Not 
spaceships and lost worlds and 
freaky-looking aliens. And you 
never start a story with a long ex- 
position. And you have to got to 
watch the jargon. All those made-up 
names. People don’t relate to 
smart-alecky aliens or exotic 
backgrounds. Character, George 

He never listened. God knows, I 
tried. 

Pournelle I would advise to give 



up writing entirely. No explanation. 
I’d simply refuse to have him in my 
class. 

Martin’s “The Stone City,” tells 
the story of a man who finds him- 
self marooned on a very remote 
world. He was part of the crew of a 
ship called the Pegasus, which may 
have fled to avoid destruction. All 
the rest of the crewmen died one by 
one, and he is left in an ancient 
stone city forced to steal to survive. 

He has a companion who is map- 
ping the labyrinth ways of the city, 
which is undermined by miles and 
miles of corridors; while the hero 
schemes to escape the planet before 
he goes mad. They are the only two 
humans there, and likely to be the 
last for a long time to come. Who 
he is, and how he got in this predi- 
cament, is related in flash-backs. 
What happens is murder and flight 
into the bowels of the city. 

Martin has a way of taking an 
original idea and making it sound 
like something out of the 1930’s. 
But once into a Martin story. I’m 
hooked, and I have fun all the way. 

Pournelle’s “Silent Leges” is 
about a young college student who 
inadvertently gets involved in a 
rebel student demonstration and 
winds up sentenced to three years at 
hard labor on a distant world where 
convicts are sold to plantation own- 
ers and, even when their sentences 
are up, never do get back to earth. 

Pournelle reminds me of Ayn 
Rand in that his stories can be read 
two ways — as either straight melo- 
drama or a hilarious parody of Hol- 
lywood films. As I read “Silent 
Leges,” I could not help casting the 
picture: John Garfield as the 

boy. .Akim Tamiroff as the plan-

tation owner. .H.B. Warner as 
Tappinger. .Edward G. Robinson 
as Curt Morgan. Well, the descrip- 
tions don’t fit, but you get the idea. 
You’ve seen it all on the Late Show 
many times. Pournelle has simply 
moved it into the 1960’s and called 
it the future. 

1 loved it. 

I’m serious. It was great fun. 

But how could I love something 
in which 1 find so little to admire? 

The truth is that I know there are 
people who will admire the stories I 
hated in this book, and deplore the 
ones I enjoyed. The best 1 can tell 
you is that the Martin and Pournelle 
stories are among the best these two 
are capable of, and that, for me, 
makes the book worth buying.

A tour de Dickson 

Much attention is given to the 
“best” of the year, but little to the 
“worst;” and that is unfortunate, 
because there is so much more of 
the latter, and some of it is invari- 
ably better reading than the former. 
The quality of bad books varies, 
from simply unreadable to medicore 
to that impossible-to-define area of 
the good-bad; and while it hardly 
seems a compliment to say a writer 
has written a good-bad book, 1, per- 
sonally, would trade any number of 
Hugo winners for just one of them. 

A good-bad book is one which 
succeeds in spite of itself; one 
whose technique or theme is inde- 
fensible, whose plotting may be 
ludicrous, whose characters are 99 
44/100 per cent pure cardboard, and 



yet which, for all its failings, deliv- 
ers a rip-roaring good read. How 
few books do! 

Gordon R. Dickson’s Time 
Storm is a good-bad book, and if 
there were an award category for 
such things 1 would not hesitate to 
vote for it. 

It is the story of a man named 
Marc Despard who became a self- 
made millionaire before he was 
twenty-one, then suffered a heart- 
attack at twenty-four and went off 
to the woods to rebuild his health. 
While there, something most 
peculiar happened to the world, and 
in fact, to the entire universe. Great 
walls of mist descended upon the 
earth from space and began to move 
across the world, and wherever they 
touched, time changed. And people 
vanished — ^just about all the people 
who had ever lived. 

Despard thought of his ex-wife 
and tried to reach her. He acquired 
two companions: a young mute girl, 
and a storm-shocked leopard named 
Sunday. Together they traveled over 
what was left of the world having 
adventures with creatures human 
and otherwise, and along the way 
they picked up a mother and her 
little girl, a group of men, whose 
allegiance was uncertain, and a 
young physicist who was studying 
the time storm. He was one who 
gave Despard the idea that it could 
be fought. 

The idea gets further boost from 
a strange alien being named Por- 
niarsk, or rather, his “avatar,” who 
has been sent to Earth to try to 
stabilize the storm in that area. Por- 
niarsk thinks Despard has special 
talents, and guides him toward de- 
veloping them. How they fight the

time stoim, and what happens af- 
terwards comprises the remainder, of 
the novel. 

If that sounds simple enough, let 
me say right away that this is one 
of Dickson’s most ambitious and 
complex books and takes place on 
three levels simultaneously. 

On the one hand, it is a 
straight-forward post-holocaust 
novel, with the survivors struggling 
to remain alive, meeting other sur- 
vivors, setting up a community, and 
trying to solve the mystery of what 
has happened to the world. 

On the other hand, it is a science 
fiction problem novel, in which the 
nature of the time storm and its so- 
lution occupies two-thirds of its 
length. 

On still another hand, it is, like 
Gregory Benford’s recent In the 
Ocean of Night, the story of a 
man’s spiritual pilgrimage to self- 
discovery and fulfillment by way of 
human and extraterrestrial relation- 
ships. And it is this latter aspect 
that proves the key to the solution 
of the other two problems. 

What is good about the book is 
that Dickson knows how to tell an 
exciting story. Not a chapter goes 
by without incident, and from the 
first, he commands our attention, if 
not with action, then with inven- 
tion. First, he thoroughly involves 
us with the protagonists adventures, 
then with the problem of the time 
storm, then with the spiritual search 
of Marc Despard, keeping us guess- 
ing, wondering, all the while, what 
will happen next. 

1 found the last third of it over- 
long, but that my have been be- 
cause 1 read the book too slowly. It 
should be read as fast as possible 



for, really, the story is all it has 
going for it. It is a cliche from be- 
ginning to end, and from top to 
bottom, without a stroke of origi- 
nality except for the time storm it- 
self, which struck me as ridiculous 
for the most part. 

The hero is so heroic he becomes 
tedious toward the end; so super- 
intelligent, super-competent, super- 
lucky. Ho-hum. And as for his 
spiritual search, it is never credible 
for a moment. Dickson is only bor- 
ing when he indulges Despard in 
soul-searching. As for the othir 
characters, they are, like the plot, 
and everything in the plot, carbon 
copies of what you have read so 
many times before. 

In short, it is that kind of book 
that if you think about it for even a 
moment it will fall completely 
apart. Totally superficial. And yet 
fun all the way. 

What saves the book from un- 
readability, and from mediocrity, is 
Dickson masterful skill at narrative 
technique. He is a first-rate 
craftsman who knows how to put a 
complicated plot together, draw a 
character, or elucidate a theme in a 
few, or a few thousand, words. And 
if what he lacks here is originality, 
what he has is alot more going for 
him than you might think. 

If I were teaching creative writing 
1 would recommend this for study, 
for all the principles and techniques 
are here in full view as if it were 
designed for student writers. As it 
is, I will recommend it to anyone 
out there who enjoys a good’ rip- 
roaring adventure story with hard-sf 
problem-solving engineers going up 
against the galaxy. You won’t ad- 
mire it, but you’ll love it. ★

MUSIC TO READ SF BY 




Music guaranteed to send the imagination soar- 
ing. Music to take you into the same exciting new 
dimensions of time and place offered by writers 
like Heinlein, Asimov, and Clarke. Including film 
scores from such movies as Fahrenheit 451, this 
superb stereo recording is a $4.95 value. Now it is 
available exclusively to members of The Science 
Fiction Book Club at a big 40% saving — yours for 
just $2.95 when you join. 

How the Club works: 

When your application for membership 'ts accept- 
ed. you'll receive your introductory package of 4 
books. (If you also want the record, check the ap- 
propriate box in the coupon below.) If not com- 




pletely satisfied, you may return this introductory 
package in ten days' time — membership will be 
cancelled and you'll owe nothing. 

About every 4 weeks (14 times a year), we’ll 
send you the Club’s bulletin, describing the 2 com- 
ing Selections and a variety of Alternate choices. 
If you want both Selections, you need do nothing; 
they’ll be shipped automatically. If you don’t want 
a Selection, or prefer an Alternate, or no book at 
• all, just fill out the convenient form always pro- 
vided, and return it by the date specified. We try to 
allow you at least ten days for making your deci- 
sion. If you don’t get the form in time to respond 
within 10 days, and receive unwanted books, you 
may return them at our expense. 

As a member you need take only 4 Selections or 
Alternates during the coming year. You may resign 
any time thereafter, or remain a member as long as 
you wish. At least one of the two Selections each 
month is only $1.98 plus shipping and- handling. 
Other extra-value selections are slightly higher but 
always much less than Publishers' Editions. Send 
no money. But do send the coupon today.
