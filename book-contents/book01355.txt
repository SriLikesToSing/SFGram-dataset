Sufficient Unto The Day 



By a popular school definition, fic- 
tion holds up a mirror to life. Our 
stories simply reflect what we are. 
And if that is true, we may be in for 
the end of what some have called 
our most precious heritage — hu- 
man dignity. The great bulk of the 
so-called mainstream literature (and 
of New WhatchamacalKt science fic- 
tion) seems concerned with petty an- 
ti-heroes who whine over the lot of 
mankind but do nothing about it 
And they may be reflecting accurate- 
ly a tendency that is strong in cur- 
rent human development 

The concept that the human ani- 
mal is entitled to earn and hold dig- 
nity as an individual is fairly rare in 
human history. We inherited it from 
three sources. The ancient Hebrews 
somehow developed it. The Roman 
Republic held it for centuries, and 
its tradition got passed on into Chris- 
tianity to some extent And above all, 
the ancient Norse people brought it 
to its peak and passed it on to ,us. 
(Even their gods had human dignity, 
and did not — uniquely — violate 
the dignity of their worshippers.) But 
to most of the rest of the world, 
dignity lay only in high places, or in 
the horde known as the State. 

Probably it’s a luxury concept an 



overcrowded world of nearly four 
billion people cannot well preserve. 
And hence, our current literature 
may be correct in reflecting the loss 
of man’s belief in his own particular 
dignity. 

But science fiction does not re- 
flect. It projects. And mostly we deal 
with worlds where men must have 
sense of human importance and dig- 
nity. 

Without that feeling, men do 
not go pioneering into new worlds 
or developing new ways to handle 
the inhum an laws of nature. What 
would be an accurate reflection of 
now must inevitably be a grotesque 
and silly lie for the worlds with 
which we deal. 

Sufficient unto the day fo the evil 
thereof. We have no obligation to 
yoke our futures to it. Our strength 
as a literature comes from the fact 
that we don’t limit ourselves to tell- 
ing it as it is. We can and should 
tell it as it will be — as it must 
and should be. 

Science fiction has its own dignity 
and need not reflect anything from 
the literatures that have abandoned 
all hope on their long descent into 
their uninteresting hells.

Drool was alien and green and ugly . 
And there was no other rock group 
like him anywhere — in the beginning .

the studio on January 2nd. Ten Besides, he did my kind of pic- 

minutes after I checked into my ture — he*d just finished a spook- 

office I got a call from my pro- tacular, The Turn Of The Screw, 

ducer, Effingwell Wright. and was now considering a sequel, 



6 





The Return Of The Screw . Which 
was why I’d been hired. 

At least that’s what I thought 
until I arrived at Wright’s office. 

“We’re going to do Hamlet ” he 
announced. 

“Hamlet?” 

Wright nodded through a wreath 
of cigar-smoke. “That’s it, baby. 
Now we only got one problem. How 
do we lick the story?” 

I stared at him. “I’m afraid I’ve 
never had any experience with 
Shakespeare.” 

“Don’t worry, you won’t be 
working with him.” Wright’s cigar 
waved dismissal of the problem. 
“But there’s a ghost in this prop- 
erty, isn’t there? And that’s where 
you come in.” 

That, actually, is where Wright’s 
secretary came in and handed him 
a letter. 

“Here’s the censorship report. 
It just arrived.” 

“Censorship?” Wright scowled 
through the smoke. 

“From the Anti-Amusement 
League. They want some changes 
in the story-treatment.” 

Wright scanned the letter, shak- 
ing his head and muttering as he 
read. 

“Relationship between Hamlet 
and his mother is unacceptable to 
this office. Suggest you make him 
an orphan.” Wright frowned, then 
went on. “Rosencrantz and Guild- 
enstem objectionable for ethnic 
reasons — no Jewish names. Rec- 
GROOVYLAND 



ommend you make them Negroes.” 
Wright sighed and con- 
tinued. “Be * sure to eliminate vio- 
lence — no duels, no killings at the 
end.” He began to frown again. 
“Imperative that you cut the 
phrase, To be or not to be . It 
might encourage suicide.” Wright’s 
frown darkened. “Remove business 
with skull in graveyard scene. Bet- 
ter still, drop graveyard scene en- 
tirely. Too gruesome for kiddies in 
audience. Finally, we cannot ac- 
cept the ghost. There must be no 
cheap, morbid nonsense about spir- 
its of the dead thirsting for re- 
venge. Sincerely — ” 

Wright shrugged at me. “Sorry, 
baby. You can’t fight progress.” 
He rose and moved with me to the 
door. “I’d Jike to use you on this 
project, but the Anti-Amusement 
League carries a lot of clout in the 
industry. I suggest you go back to 
your office and clean out your 
drawers.” 

I got the message. I was being 
tossed out on my assignment. 

Meanwhile, back at the Unem- 
ployment Office — 

II 

nphe first thing I did at the Un- 
employment Office was read 
the bulletin board to see if there 
were any openings. It had only one 
listing today, and I glanced at it. 

“Nit-pickers wanted . Must be 
experienced quibblers” 

7 




I shook my head. No government 
job for me. Better off to apply for 
compensation. So I bought a paper 
and got in line to wait for my in- 
terview. 

From the look of the headlines, 
the year was starting off with a 
bang. Wars were escalating abroad, 
prices were escalating at home and 
taxes were just plain rising. Eigh- 
teen people had been killed in a 
riot for peace, and there was talk 
that no such groups would be al- 
lowed to demonstrate in the future 
without a riot-permit. A small box 
contained a bulletin on 981 traffic 
fatalities and a large front-page 
story dealt with the arrest of a lo- 
cal museum guard who had been 
accused of mummy-molesting. 

I sought solace in the sports sec- 
tion, reading the scores of the New 
Year’s football games — the Rose 
Bowl, the Cotton Bowl, the Sugar 
Bowl, the Toilet Bowl — 

“Pardon me,” the soft voice mur- 
mured. 

Glancing up, I saw this unnatur- 
al blonde, the lass with the psyche- 
delicate air. 

“Are you three o’clock?” she 
asked. It took me a moment to in- 
terpret her question; she wanted to 
know the time of my interview. 

“That’s right,” I nodded. 

“Mind if I slip in ahead of you? 
I’m two-forty-five.” 

Actually, I’d have guessed her 
to be 36-24-36, so I gallantly al- 
lowed her to precede me and re- 



turned to my reading. When I 
looked up again, she was gone, and 
I stepped before the window to do 
the interview bit 
It wasn’t until I went outside 
that I saw her again. 

She was standing on the curb be- 
side the car parked just ahead of 
mine — a beat-up old heap 'with a 
bumper-sticker reading I Want To 
Be Conspicuous. The car was dec- 
orated with the usual floral de- 
signs, but from the look on the 
girl’s face I gathered that her 
Flower Power had wilted. 
“Trouble?” I inquired. 

She glanced up. “Oh, it’s you!” 
There was no point in denying 
it, so I nodded. “What’s the mat- 
ter — car won’t start?” 

It was her turn to nod. 

I opened the door and got be- 
hind the wheel. “Here, let me give 
you a hand.” I gave her more than 
a hand; I gave her a foot, on the 
gas-pedal. The motor coughed, 
spluttered, then gave an unmistak- 
able death-rattle. 

“Don’t bother,” she told me. 
“It’s totalled.” And she started to 
walk away. 

“Hey, aren’t you going to call 
the Auto Club?” 

“Not unless they’ll give me a 
lift home.” 

I climbed out hastily. “Where’s 
that?” 

“Above the Strip. On Basic 
Drive. You know where that is?” 
I opened the door of my own 

IF

car. “Get in, and I’ll prove it.” 
“Thanks.” She slid across the 
seat, snuggling over on the passen- 
ger side. I climbed in after her and 
we peeled off. 

A s we turned up Highland, I 
learned that her name was 
Sandy Simpson. Making a left on 
Sunset, I discovered that she was 
a professional body. 

“That’s right,” she said, as I re- 
acted by nearly ramming the car 
into a lamp-post. “I sell my body 
for a living. All, or any part of it. 
You know, like in a TV commer- 
cial with a star — sometimes her 
hands show her age, so when they 
cut to a tight closeup, it’s my hands 
in the shot. Or maybe my feet. I 
do knees and elbows, too, and I’m 
very good at cleavage.” 

“In other words, you’re a dou- 
ble?” 

“A dubber, too. I specialize in 
howls for the laugh-tracks on com- 
edy shows.” And she gave out with 
an ear-splitting screech. 

“Sounds like a good racket.” 
“Not lately.” Sandy sighed heav- 
ily. “Haven’t had a studio call in 
three months. I’d have starved to 
death if it wasn’t for a couple of 
nose residuals I got from an old 
sinus-tablet commercial.” 

“So that’s why you were down 
collecting compensation.” 

Sandy nodded. “What’s your ex- 
cuse?” 

“I’m a writer. In this business 



we are constantly starving.” 
“TV or movies?” 

“I’m versatile. I starve in both.” 
I crossed Crescent Heights and 
moved on into Sunset Strip. 
“Couldn’t you do like, books?” 
“I’ve done like, books. Three of 
them, to be exact. How To Drown 
A Fish, The Romance of Sewage 
Disposal, and one of those big 
special gift-books — A Pictorial 
History of Dandruff” 

“Did they sell?” 

“Like hot-cakes.” I shrugged. 
“Trouble is, nobody buys hot-cakes 
in a bookstore.” 

“But you’re really a writer?” 
Sandy eyed me curiously. “What’s 
your name?” 

“Considine. Joe Considine.” 
“You got a pad around here?” 
This time I nearly piled up the 
car against a street sign. Not be- 
cause of the implications of her 
question, but due to something I 
suddenly remembered. Something 
weighing about 250 pounds of sol- 
id, unyielding granite — my land- 
lord. 

“I did,” I told her. “That is, I 
do and I don’t. I mean, I haven’t 
been getting up the rent for a cou- 
ple of months and the landlord is 
leaning on me. I figured on draw- 
ing a salary advance today, only 
my job was shot down. So when I 
show up tonight without a pay- 
ment, it’s outsville.” 

“\\Tiat abotft your compensa- 
tion?”

“Two week waiting period be- 
fore I collect the first check.” 

“I knew it!” Sandy bounced up 
and down on the seat, squealing 
happily. “Now you can move in 
with me!” 

I gave her a double-take, and she 
nodded quickly. “The minute I 
saw you standing in line, I figured 
you’d be a good choice.” 

This time I watched the road be- 
fore replying. “You mean you came 
down to the Unemployment Office 
to shop for a room-mate?” 

“Not a room, man. A great big 
groovy spread. And you can pay 
your share of the rent when your 
compensation checks come through 

— just like the others.” 

“Others?” 

Sandy nodded. “Don’t worry, 
you won’t be crowded. You’ll see.” 
She gave me a reassuring smile. 
“Like I’m not pressuring you. Just 
think about it.” 

T thought about is as I drove. 

Drove along Sunset Strip, pass- 
ing all the familiar landmarks. Here 
were the shops and the signs — Mr. 
Gladys, the hair stylist — Mother 
Naked’s Southern Fried Chicken 

— Toilet A-Go-Go — the interior 
decorator place where they restored 
antique furniture like new — and 
the other interior decorator place 
where they aged new furniture to 
make it look antique. We sped by 
the Now Generation Clinic, spe- 
cializing in youthful diseases like 



hippytitis, and passed the Topless 
Restaurant where I had once been 
thrown out for not wearing a neck- 
tie. 

Dusk was falling, and the hippies 
were rising; the under-achievers, 
members of the uptrodden masses, 
hiding from the world behind dark 
glasses and beards. 

This was the scene — boots and 
bare feet, buttons and bushy hair 
and beads, the mod and the odd 
intermingled. I’d never been with 
it; among these Flower Children I 
was just an elderly weed. But now, 
under the circumstances, perhaps 
I’d better blossom forth. 

I glanced at Sandy. There were 
worse fates than sharing a pad with 
her. At least it might be a tem- 
porary solution, until my agent 
came up with another job. 

“Okay, it’s a deal,” I told her 
“I’ll sneak my things out of’ the 
apartment and move in tomorrow.” 

“Crazy,” she said. “Turn right 
at the next corner — that’s Basic 
Drive.” 

I turned right at the next corner 
and started the climb up a dark 
and deserted hillside street. 

And that’s where the crunch 
came. 

The crunch, and the squeal as 
I applied my brakes — just a mo- 
ment too late to avoid impact. Ap- 
parently the street hadn’t been en- 
tirely deserted after all, because 
there was a crumpled figure lying 
on the pavement before my car.

Sandy and I opened our doors 
simultaneously, and a moment la- 
ter we stood staring down at the 
yellow-suited, gray-booted little 
form sprawled in the street 
“Hippy outfit,” Sandy murmur- 
ed. “But he’s just a kid — ” 

I nodded, then stooped and turn- 
ed him over gently. His eyes were 
dosed and I couldn’t distinguish 
his features here in the deepening 
darkness. But his chest rose and 
fell regularly, and that’s what mat- 
tered the most to me at the mo- 
ment. 

“He’s alive.” 

I gestured to Sandy. “Hold the 
door open while I get him in.” 
Lifting him carefully, I placed 
him in the front seat of the car, 
right in the middle, so that when 
Sandy climbed in on her side he 
was propped up between us. 
“Hang onto him now,” I told her. 
Sandy nodded obediently. Then 
she gasped. 

“What’s the matter?” 

“His face — he’s turning green 1” 
“Shock.” 

I glanced over. My diagnosis was 
correct, but I had the wrong pa- 
tient It was Sandy who was in 
shock. She sat there, gaping and 
pointing, trying to speak, 

“His hands are green, too — ” 
I shook my head grimly. “Hold 
tight. We may break a few speed 
records, but I’ve got to get him to 
a hospital.” 

It was then that I felt the stir- 



ring beside me. It was then that I 
turned to see the yellow eyes pop 
open and the wide mouth part in a 
grin. The head twisted towards me 
and I heard the words. 

“Not hospital.” 

A hand rose up in a restraining 
gesture. A hand that was perhaps 
a paw — with a thumb and only 
three fingers. 

“Not hospital,” the voice repeat- 
ed firmly. And the next words fell 
like a knell of doom. “Take me to 
your leader .” 

Ill 

^Tow the Strip is filled with un- 

^ dersized specimens who wear 
far-out outfits. Some of them even 
cover their hands and faces with 
psychedelic designs in paint. Down 
there I’d probably never have given 
this one a second glance, but here 
in the lonely darkness of the hill- 
side it was different. Everything 
about him was different — his cos- 
tume, his complexion, his size and 
his eyes. The face was froglike and 
that three-fingered paw was neither 
batrachian nor human. 

“Crazy 1” Sandy whispered. 

And it was. 

Sandy seemed relieved now that 
the creatine had spoken, but I 
didn’t share her reaction. 

“Don’t you understand?” I mut- 
tered. “He’s an alien” 

“So what? I’ve got nothing 
against foreigners.” 



GROOVYLAND

“But he’s not an ordinary for- 
eigner — he’s extra-terrestrial.” 
“Nobody’s perfect,” she told me 
“The important thing is he’s not 
hurt.” She turned to the creature. 
“Isn’t that right, man?” 

“Not man. Drool.” 

“Drool? Is that your name?” 
“Yes. In your speech. Mine is 
different. Like you say, something 
else.” 

“You’re something else!” Sandy 
shook her head. “Are you really an 
alien, like Joe says?” 

The creature nodded. “I tell it 
like it is, man.” 

Sandy stared at him. “Where did 
you learn how to speak such per- 
fect English?” 

“In the ship.” 

I got into the act. “You came in 
a ship? From where?” 

“Up.” The green hand gestured. 
“Another planet?” 

Drool nodded. “But the ship was 
yours. Krool found it. What you 
call spacecraft. Hardware. One of 
yours — empty.” 

I shook my head, but not 
in doubt. It was all too possible 
in these days of Top Security. We 
might have sent out an advanced- 
design spacecraft on a secret test 
flight. If something went wrong and 
its crew was lost, the ship would 
go on, drifting through space until 
it felh into the paws of creatures 
like these. Creatures like — 
“Krool,” Sandy murmured. “Who 
is he?” 

12 



“Boss. Big Daddy. Father of us 
all. Like me, only twenty times 
more. He looks like — ” 

Drool went on to describe his 
father’s appearance, and I didn’t 
like what I heard at all. According 
to him, his sire was a cross between 
a sabre-toothed tiger and a giant 
multi-colored leopard. And he had 
no paternal affection for his son, 
because Drool was the runt of the 
litter. 

“My brothers and sisters are nor- 
mal, all four million of them. But 1 
don’t grow. Maybe not the right 
chromosomes, maybe no blue genes. 
Krool is very up-tight about it. So 
when he found the ship, he took 
me off with him. A long journey, 
but the charts told him how to go, 
and the handling was simple. You 
are still quite primitive, right?” 
“Let me get this straight,” I said. 
“Your father brought you here in 
a ship. But if the crew was missing, 
how did you learn our language?” 
“The crew left much literature 
to read and study. What you call 
comic books.” 

TT^hat explained his speech pat- 
tern. I wondered what else 
this alien had learned of our con- 
temporary culture. But there were 
more important concerns right now. 
“Where is this ship?” 

“Krool took it back.” 

“After he landed you here?” 
“Not landed. Dropped. Bad trip, 
man.” 



IF 




It was beginning to sound like 
one to me. “He dropped you out 
of the ship into space?” 

“Only a few feet. Nobody saw us 
because of the air. Like it’s a gas, 
man?” 

“Smog,” I told him. And visual- 
ized the hovering space-craft, the 
gigantic creature at the controls, 
dropping this little creature down 
to land before the car in the street 
with no one the wiser. It could hap- 
pen that way. Anything could hap- 
pen twenty feet above our heads 
and we’d never know it because of 
the prevailing pollution. It trans- 
mogrified everything it touched. 

“How cruddy!” Sandy exclaimed. 
“Cutting out on you like that — 
leaving you all alone in a strange 
place, not caring if you live or 
die — ” 

“He cares,” Drool assured her. 
“I am not left to die. It is just 
that I am so weak and small. I 
can’t come on like my brothers and 
sisters when they are sent to the 
big, important worlds. So Krool 
brings me to this earth because it 
will not be a problem for me.” He 
nodded. “Krool says even a child 
Gan do it here.” 

“Do what?” 

“My thing.” 

“Which is?” 

“The same as my brothers and 
sisters do when they go to the bet- 
ter-class planets. They conquer.” 

I turned to him. “Let’s have that 
line again. You’re really here to 

GROOVYLAND 



conquer earth. That’s your plan?” 
“That’s my bag. So take me to 
your leader.” 

“Sure.” I nodded. “And then 
what?” 

Drool smiled happily. “Then I 
merely blast him with my super- 
disintegratosonic — oppsl” . 

He sat there, suddenly silent as 
his green face slowly paled to 
chartreuse. 

Sandy eyed him anxiously. 
“What’s the matter?” 

“Krool gave me one. I know I 
had it when he lifted me out. I 
must have dropped it — ” 

“Your weapon?” 

Drool nodded, frowning. “It’s 
probably still floating around some- 
where in the smog — almost weight- 
less, you know — ” He broke off 
and peered at me anxiously. “But 
if I lost it, how do I — ?” 

“You don’t,” I told him. “And 
that’s final.” I tromped on the gas- 
pedal. “Let’s go.” 

“Where are you taking him?” 
Sandy’s voice was apprehensive. 

It was a good question, but at 
the moment I didn’t have any good 
answers. Police? The Orphan’s 
Home? Lost And Found Depart- 
ment? 

nphe answer cam,e with clarion 
clarity. For as I started the 
motor, the car was suddenly filled 
with soaring sound. 

“Ooh!” Sandy squealed. “The 
Galloping Cruds!” 

13 




And indeed it was. With ear-split- 
ling precision, that popular hard- 
rock group belted out their latest 
hit. As the guitars twanged and the 
drums echoed the beat, the voices 
proclaimed a moving message. 

“Vd like to turn you on, baby , 

But I can 9 t find the switch — ” 

Sandy cupped her hands and 
shouted, “Groovy! But turn it 
down a little.” 

“Sorry,” I yelled. “I don’t have 
a radio in the car.” 

Sandy stared at me. 

I stared at her. 

Then we both just stared at 
Drool. 

His wide mouth was wide open, 
And from it poured the sound of 
electric guitars, the thud of drums, 
the cacaphonic blending of five 
male voices. 

“Impossible!” I breathed and 
clapped my hand across Drool’s 
mouth. 

The sound blurred instantly. 

I removed my hand quickly and 
Drool looked up. “What’s with you, 
man?” he inquired. 

Sandy was still staring at him. 
“Was that really you singing?” 

“Yeah. Don’t you dig it?” 

Sandy nodded. “But how on 
earth — ?” 

“Not on earth.” Drool grinned, 
“In the ship. There was an instru- 
ment — stereo tape machine — I 
listened while I read the comic 
books.” 

“Wait a minute.” I stopped the 



car again and faced him. “Are you 
trying to tell us you can imitate 
anything you hear recorded?” 
Drool shrugged. “Why not?” 
“You mean you can do all those 
voices at once, plus the guitars and 
drums?” 

“The sounds are very simple.” 
“Your vocal cords must be tied 
in Boy Scout knots.” 

Sandy raised her hand. “Wait a 
minute.” Drool glanced at her and 
she continued. “Can you do the 
Zappers?” 

Drool opened his mouth, and the 
answer came. The Zappers — two 
male minstrels, two female min- 
strels, and one interlocuter-type — 
began to wail their Golden Record 
classic, Doobie-Do Or Doobie-Don’t 
You? With full orchestral back- 
ground. 

Then Drool did a pop ballad by 
Eddie Breech and the Clouts. After 
that, a small filet of soul music, 
followed by a children’s recording 
of East Indian raga, featuring the 
soft tones of a baby sitar. 

“Wild!” Sandy shook her head. 
“I don’t believe it!” 

“Hearing is believing,” I told 
her. “What you’ve been listening to 
is the sound of fifty million dollars 
— pouring right into our laps.” 

I put my hand on Drool’s shoul- 
der. “Still want to conquer earth?” 
I asked. 

He nodded eagerly, then frown- 
ed. “But how — ?” 

“Leave everything to us,” I as- 

IF

sured him. “I think it can be 
arranged.” 

IV 

r \ s Jack the Ripper used to say, 
how’s that for openers? 

Between the time Drool finished 
his concert and the time we parked 
in Sandy’s driveway I had it all 
figured. 

Sandy started to follow my rea- 
soning and ended up way ahead 
of me. “It’s a big deal. We’re go- 
ing to have to use the others.” 

“WHat others?” 

Sandy gestured up at the impos- 
ing mansion which loomed against 
the hilltop horizon. “I told you I 
didn’t live here alone,” she said. 
“Come along — you’ll see.” 

We left the car and moved up 
the walk. I put my hand on Drool’s 
shoulder. 

“Remember your instructions. 
Speak only when you’re spoken to 
and let us do the talking. Play it 
cool.” 

He nodded, and we entered. 

Then it was my turn to remem- 
ber instructions. But I found it very 
difficult to keep my cool in the 
overheated atmosphere of Sandy’s 
pad. 

Somehow I hadn’t expected her 
to live in a twenty-room mansion, 
complete with marble floors, a fire- 
place in every bedroom, and an in- 
door swimming pool. 

“Don’t you recognize where you 



are?” she murmured. “It’s the old 
Riga Mortice place.” 

Something clicked, and I nodded. 
I remembered Riga Mortice very 
well indeed. She had been a popular 
entertainer during my childhood, 
until illness forced her retirement 
No longer a bouncy, bubbling in- 
genue, she became a victim of al- 
cohol, narcotics and diet-pills. But 
her fans never deserted her, and 
when she emerged to make a come- 
back on a singing tour, her popu- 
larity boomed again. Her first ap- 
pearance, weak and wan and forty 
pounds lighter, had sparked some- 
thing in the souls of a hundred 
million middle-aged female fans, 
who identified with her because of 
their own hypochondria. Since they 
themselves were on a daily diet of 
sleeping pills, pep pills, water pills, 
reducing pills, tranquilizers and 
laxatives, Riga Mortice became 
their heroine. They flocked to her 
concerts, not to hear her voice but 
merely to see if she’d manage to 
last out the performance. When- 
ever she cancelled an engagement 
or took an overdose of liquor, popu- 
lar enthusiasm increased; some of 
the adoring lady fans even kept 
scrapbooks filled with clippings on 
her suicide attempts. Her appear- 
ance on crutches brought applause; 
her tour in a wheelchair was a 
smash hit, and when she finally be- 
gan to sing to her public from a 
microphone built into an iron lung, 
she was Number One Box Office.

UDiga Mortice,” I murmured. 

“Of course! Whatever hap* 
pened to her?” 

“Something terrible,” Sandy 
sighed. “She got healthy.” 

I shook my head. “Sad, isn’t it? 
Here was a gal who had every- 
thing — neurasthenia, self-destruc- 
tive tendencies, a manic-depressive 
psychosis — what a shame to lose 
all that talent!” 

“She lost this house, too,” Sandy 
explained. “That’s when we moved 
in.” 

“We?” 

“I and the others.” Sandy was 
leading Drool and me along an im- 
posing corridor panelled in solid 
mahogany from floor to thirty-foot 
ceiling. 

“But how can you afford it?” 

“Because we’re all on unem- 
ployment compensation. There’s 
six of us here — that is, until we 
lost one of our tenants yesterday. 
He got a job and moved into a 
one-room furnished apartment. 
Now he can’t afford to stay here.” 

“But isn’t he making more mon- 
ey — ?” 

“Look. His job only pays him a 
hundred and fifty a week. We each 
get seventy-five dollars in compen- 
sation.” 

“I don’t understand.” 

“Our seventy-five is net, tax 
free. But after this poor guy pays 
commission to his agent, and de- 
ductions are taken from his check 
for income tax, surtax, social se- 
GROOVYLAND 



curity, state disability insurance 
and all the rest, he winds up with 
less bread than we have.” 

I was beginning to get the pic- 
ture. Six times seventy-five is lour 
hundred and fifty dollars a week 
— more than enough to pay the 
rent on . even such a palatial pad 
as this one. And that’s why Sandy 
had scouted the Unemployment 
Office; she needed to replace the 
sixth tenant with a new resident, 
such as me. 

Sandy smiled at me. “How about 
that?” she inquired, gesturing at 
the sweep and thrust of the three- 
story staircase which rose at the 
end of the hall. “Where else eould 
you find such a glad pad for sev- 
enty-five per, including food, li- 
quor and gas for your wheels?” 

I glanced around. “Something’s 
missing, though. I don’t see any 
chairs and tables.” 

“Oh, that!” She made a gesture 
of dismissal. “We don’t have any 
yet. But we’re planning to buy 
some period furniture — on month- 
ly payments, of course. Meanwhile, 
we just make do.” She steered 
Drool and me toward an ornate 
double door. “But come on and 
meet the others.” 

Hphe others were gathered ter the 
cocktail hour at the drained 
indoor swimming pool. Seated in- 
side it, with their bottoms touch- 
ing bottom, they gave us glasses 
and greetings. 

17 




Seldom have I seen such a col- 
lection of disparate types, but as 
Sandy made the introductions I be- 
gan to sense that they were desper- 
ate types as well. All of them had 
one thing in common — they were 
bom losers. 

Sandy led me to a spade-beard- 
ed, scholarly-looking gentleman 
whose name was Mr. Barf. Re- 
garding me mournfully, he started 
to rise and I waved him back. 
“Please don’t get up on my ac- 
count,” I told him. 

Barf broke into a sudden smile. 
“Thank you. I prefer it here at the 
bottom of the pool.” 

“Mr. Barf is our philosopher,” 
Sandy explained. “He once tried to 
drown himself in Walden Pond.” 
“Unsuccessfully, I fear,” Barf 
sighed. “Next time I hope to be 
more Thoreau about it” 

The wan little man beside him 
scowled at me. “What did you 
mean by that ‘on my account’ 
crack?” he demanded suspiciously. 

“Don’t mind Mr. Emia,” Sandy 
whispered. “He’s very sensitive 
about such things. He used to be 
the cashier in a blood-bank, but 
they fired him for embezzlement.” 
Luke Emia glowered at me but 
accepted my hand in greeting 
Sandy moved with me to a mop- 
headed young man whose psyche- 
delic jacket was covered with but- 
tons, although he still looked as if 
he didn’t have all of his own. “Mr. 
Grafitti,” she announced. “He 



writes a column ior one of the un- 
derground newspapers.” 

“Pleased to meet you.” 

“ — ,” said Grafitti, pleasantly. 
Warmed by his greeting, I moved 
on to the next tenant. This young 
man, introduced to me simply as 
Swinger, was so ragged, filthy and 
unkempt that I automatically peg- 
ged him as a musician. Such proved 
to be the case. He had once been 
part of a recording group, he told 
me, until he suffered a nasty shock 
— when his electriconic harmonica 
had short-circuited on a high note 
and blown all the caps off his teeth. 
Since that time, apparently, he’d 
nursed a grudge against aU per- 
formers including singers, and car- 
ried on an active crusade against 
them. 

“I just got busted,” he concluded 
mournfully. 

“Not again?” Sandy sighed. 
“What happened?” 

“Well, I read where Tony Ben- 
nett was opening at a club here in 
town, and you know what that 
means. Last night I went down 
there, and when he came on and 
started singing I Lost My Heart 
In San Francisco , I walked up on 
the stage and handed him one. It 
was only a beef-heart, of course, 
but the fuzz hauled me in anyway.” 
Shaking her head in commisera- 
tion, Sandy led me to the last mem- 
ber of the gathering, a dapper bald- 
ing man who greeted me with a 
firm handclasp.

“Ko tic’s the name,” he told me. 
“But you can call me Cy.” 

I blinked in sudden recognition. 
“Not the Drive-In Psychiatrist? 
The one who used to set up his 
couch in the parking lot over in 
Beverly Hills?,” 

“Five couches,” he announced 
proudly. “A regular open-air clin- 
ic.” His smile faded. “But I got 
out of the racket. It is a racket, 
you know. Head-shrinkers don’t do 
you any good — the thing to do is 
get your head Sanforized. I re- 
tired to work out my new theories.” 

D uring this exchange, Drool had 
been standing patiently and 
silently at my side. Now Mr. Kotic 
eyed him speculatively. 

“Who’s your sickie friend?” he 
inquired. 

“He’s not sick,” Sandy declared. 
“Well, he’s too short to be the 
Jolly Green Giant,” Kotic mut- 
tered. “And you must admit he is 
green around the gills. In fact, dur- 
ing my entire professional career 
I’ve never seen anyone look green- 
er. Ergo, he must be ill. Note the 
hyperthyroid bulge of his eyes, the 
reddish pupils, the nasal malforma- 
tion and the labial deformity. I’ve 
been a psychiatrist too long not to 
recognize a real ding-a-ling when 
I see one.” 

I gave Sandy a quick glance and 
she picked up her cue. “That’s no 
way to talk about my cousin,” she 
retorted. 



“Cousin?” Barf’s eyebrows rose. 

“That’s right. He’s a hippy from 
San Francisco,” he murmured. 
“Haight-Ashbury.” 

Luke Emia rose and approached 
him curiously. “What’s your name, 
man?” 

Drool had learned his answers 
well. “Sneed Hearn,” he said. 

“ I ” sneered Grafitti. 

“You can say that again,” mut- 
tered the Swinger. “Like, I mean 
all us old W.C. Fields fans know 
that ‘Sneed Hearn’ is a name he 
made up and used in The Old 
Fashioned Way” 

I paled. Stupid of me not to re- 
member that today’s In Group 
were old film buffs. 

“All right,” Swinger persisted. 
“Lay it on us, man. Who is this 
creep?” 

Cy Kotic moved closer to the 
hapless Drool, who shrank from 
his professional scrutiny. “I can’t 
identify the syndrome yet,” the 
psychiatrist muttered. “But I am 
getting a definite gut reaction from 
him. That is to say, he’s making 
me sick at my stomach.” 

“— ?” Grafitti inquired. 

“A good question.” Barf joined 
the group clustered around Drool 
and nodded philosophically. 

Sandy gave me a helpless look, 
and I stepped forward. 

“All right,” I said. “Guess there’s 
no sense trying to conceal the 
truth from you. It would have to 
come out sooner or later.”

“Joel” Sandy’s voice sounded an 
alarm. 

“I know what I’m doing,” I as- 
sured her. “Come on, everybody 
drink up and I’ll plug you in.” 

And that, of course, was exactly 
the procedure. They passed the 
drinks, and I passed the word. 

Half an hour later they were 
falling out of their trees as Drool’s 
open mouth emitted a stereophonic 
version of the latest protest-song 
recorded by that group of militant 
young rebels known as Tarzan and 
All the Apes. 

By the time he closed his mouth, 
theirs were hanging open. 

“Well?” I murmured. “How did 
that grab you? Think he can con- 
quer the world now?” 

“ I ” said Grafitti. 

Which just about summed it up. 



V 

Qandy sent out for some Chin- 
^ ese food from Pu King’s, and 
we huddled over the meal discus- 
sing the deal. 

Grafitti’s reaction was shared by 
most of the others. Only Barf 
seemed to have reservations. 

“I don’t know,” he mused. “This 
may not be the most propitious 
time for such a project. After all, 
Mars is in conjunction with Uran- 
us — ” 

“Watch your language,” Sandy 
cautioned him. Then to me: “Mr. 

20 



Barf is not only a philosopher, he’s 
an astrologer.” 

“That’s his problem,” I told her, 
“My horoscope tells me not to put 
any faith in astrology.” 

“I don’t know anything about 
astrology,” declared Swinger, his 
words filtering through a mouthful 
of fried rice. “But with that voice, 
we can’t miss. And the way he does 
all of that instrumental accompa- 
niment too — man, it’s something 
else!” 

Drool blushed a deeper shade 
viridan at the compliment and 
lowered his head modestly over the 
sweet-and-sour pork. 

I waved a forkful of chow-mein 
at the gathering. 

“The way I see it, we’ve got a 
winning team. As Swinger says, 
Drool has a voice that doesn’t quit 
He can sing anything, in any style, 
imitating any group and any or- 
chestration or accompaniment. But 
he’s got something else that’s equal- 
ly important.” 

“And what’s that?” Luke Emia 
inquired. “What else has he got?” 

“The uglies.” I jabbed my fork 
in Drool’s direction. “Look at him 
— did you ever see a more repul- 
sive, disgusting specimen in your 
life?” 

Drool popped his eyes at me, 
and I quickly shook my head. “I’m 
not putting you down,” I said, 
hastily. “This is your most impor- 
tant asset.” 

“I don’t get it,” Sandy said.

“You will, if you stop and think. 
What makes one hard rock group 
more popular than another today? 
It can’t be the difference in musi- 
cal arrangements, because they all 
use the same beat or off-beat 
revved up to Total Sound, or Total 
Sound Effects. It can’t be varia- 
tions in singing style, because they 
all have the same delivery — no- 
body understands the words. Even 
the soloist soul-singers and the pro- 
test groups sound basically alike, 
snarling about love or crooning 
about hate. So what’s that extra 
ingredient which makes a star?” 

“Appearance?” Swinger ven- 
tured. 

I swallowed my chow-mein and 
nodded. “Exactly! Years ago it was 
enough for a nice-looking kid to 
come out on the stage and make 
anguished faces while he sang. Then 
it became necessary for him to con- 
tort his body in spastic spasms in 
order to make a pleasing impres- 
sion on the audience — since he 
sounded as if he was having a fit, 
he might as well look like he was, 
too. 

“But as audiences grew mofe 
sophisticated, that wasn’t enough 
any more. Singers started to dress 
in weirdo outfits. Wild colors and 
sequins at one extreme, rags and 
blue-jeans at the other — it didn’t 
matter which, as long as the pants 
were tight enough. 

“Then came the real revolution. 
Not just the change in clothe? but 

GROOVYLAND 



the change in bodies. First we had 
sideburns, then long hair, then the 
bushy mop. The beards and mus- 
taches followed — mostly amongst 
the males. Now we have dark 
glasses, granny glasses, tattooing, 
psychedelic makeup, the works. 
The ugliest-looking singers, making 
the ugliest sounds and using the 
ugliest words, make the most beau- 
tiful dollars.” 

C y Kotic nodded in emphatic 
agreement. “He tells it like 
it is,” he declared. “Today’s sing- 
ing star must give the audience the 
whole sado-masochistic mystique, 
and no mistake. Oral aggression in 
the words, revolt against the Es- 
tablishment in the clothing — that 
takes care of the latent hostility. 
And for the self-pitying compo- 
nent, that finds its expression in the 
downbeat, beat-up look. 

“I see great possibilities here. 
Because our little friend is prob- 
ably the weirdest-looking freak-out 
yet. Consider his assets! He’s nose- 
less, almost bald, built like a one- 
man disaster area, and best of all, 
he’s green!” Cy Kotic smiled at 
Drool admiringly. “I don’t want 
you to get a big head over this, 
but as a practicing psychiatrist it 
is my professional opinion that 
you’re the most miserable-looking 
yutz I’ve ever encountered.” 

It was my turn to rise and step 
forward. “You see? With Drool’s 
natural gifts of voice and appear- 

21 




ance he can’t miss. All he needs is 
the proper management team be- 
hind him. And that’s where we ah 
come in.” 

“We do?” Luke Emia muttered. 

“Of course. Every star must have 
an entourage, and we’re it. Sandty, 
here, will handle the secretarial 
duties. Mr. Emia, with his banking 
experience, is a natural for treasur- 
er. Swinger, we’ll need you for mus- 
ic and arrangements.” 

Grafitti cleared his throat 
“ ?” he ventured. 

“Songs are no good without lyr- 
ics,” I reminded him. “And with 
your background in the under- 
ground press, you know all the 
right wrong words. Consider your- 
self a lyricist.” 

“ ,” said Grafitti, grate- 

fully. 

I turned my attention to Cy 
Kotic. “You, of course, will be in- 
valuable as our psychological con- 
sultant in public relations. Handle 
our ads, our presentation format 
And I, naturally, am going to func- 
tion as agent and business mana- 
ger. And that’s the wrap-up, kid- 
dies.” 

Mr. Barf cleared hut throat tim- 
idly. “What about me?” 

“Wdl,” I hedged. “Maybe we 
can use some astrological predic- 
tions along the way. Advice from 
the stars to a star, that sort of 
thing.” 

‘Tve got another suggestion.” 
Surprisingly enough, it was Sandy 
22 



who spoke. “Mr. Barf here knows 
a great deal about the World and 
its ways. After all, he’s a philoso- 
pher.” 

Barf nodded. “That’s why I 
tried to kill myself,” he agreed. 

Sandy moved to Drool and 
placed her hand on his shoulder. 
“You say all you know about earth 
is what you learned from listening 
to the radio and reading comic 
books.” 

“Right,” Drool conceded. 

“Then there you have it,” Sandy 
told me. “Mr. Barf can be Drool’s 
teacher. Let him educate Drool, 
broaden his knowledge, expand his 
horizons — ” 

“Okay,” I said. “Just as long as 
he doesn’t teach him so much that 
he’ll want to drown himself.” 
“Have no fear,” Barf said. “The 
swimming pool is empty.” 

And it was, because we all climb- 
ed up and crowded our way into 
the hall, glasses held high. Sandy 
refilled them quickly. 

“A toast, then,” I proposed. “A 
toast to that new singing sensation 
of the nation — that multi-voiced 
marvel, star of radio, television, 
motion pictures, recording artiste 
and just plain little old multi-mil- 
lionaire — Sneed Hearn 1 ” 

We gulped our drinks. “That 
does it,” I declared. “And now, 
beddy-bye for everybody. Got a 
big day scheduled for tomorrow.” 
Drool glanced at me. “Where are 
we going?” 



IF 




“To launch your career,” I an- 
swered. “Bright and early, we’re 
off to Groovyland.” 

VI 

Tt was early when we started, but 
not bright. 

As the car rolled down the ramp 
and inched itself into the morning 
traffic on the freeway, I switched 
on the fog-lights. It was the only 
way to go, here in the yellowish, 
billowing murk that shrouded our 
bumper-to-bumper crawl. 

Drool sat beside me. I glanced 
past him at Sandy. She sat utterly 
still, eyes closed in concentration. 

“Something wrong?” 

Sandy shook her head. “Just do- 
ing my yoga. The stop-breathing 
exercises. It's the only way to cope 
with the smog.” 

Drool took a deep breath. “I like 
this air,” he announced. “It re- 
minds me of home. The — what do 
you call it? — smog is very nour- 
ishing.” 

“That reminds me of something,” 
I said. “You didn’t touch your food 
last night.” 

“I don’t have to eat,” Drool an- 
nounced. “All I need is this.” And 
he took another deep breath. 

“Well, I do.” Sandy glanced at 
the torturous tangle of the inter- 
change. “When we get out of this 
mess, let’s have some breakfast.” 

We were well past Pomona be- 
fore the traffic thinned and we 



pulled off onto the highway lead- 
ing to our destination. 

“Breakfast it is,” I said. “Let’s 
try this place.” 

The El Ulcero was a typical 
roadside restaurant, very spic and 
Spanish. As Sandy concluded or- 
dering, I whispered to the waiter. 
“Where’s the Juan?” 

Drool accompanied me, although 
he had no need to. I eyed him cur- 
iously. He didn’t eat and last night 
he hadn’t slept — just sat beside 
me as I curled up in the sleeping- 
bag Sandy gave me. Apparently his 
physiological needs were different 
from ours. But at the moment it 
was the difference in his appear- 
ance that worried me. The waiter 
had stared at him suspiciously, and 
I began to wish that I’d told Drool 
to stay in the car. 

But I couldn’t hide him away 
forever, and we rejoined Sandy at 
the table. 

Immediately the waiter was at 
our side. “The leetle boy,” he mur- 
mured. “He ees not eating.” 

“Not hungry,” I said, curtly. 
“Mus’ be seeck,” the waiter ob- 
served. “Behold of the face. Ees 
very green, no?” 

“Yes,” I challenged. “What’s the 
matter, haven’t you ever seen a 
green face before?” 

“Only after eating here,” the 
waiter shrugged. 

He stepped up to Drool. 

“Observe of the hands. They al- 
so are green.” 



GROOVYLAND

“Of course,” I told him, “The 
kid’s a natural-born gardener. 
Haven’t you heard of a green 
thumb?” N 

Nudging Sandy, I whispered, 
“Let’s get out of here.” 

We rose, paid the check and 
fled. The waiter stared after us, 
muttering to himself. 

“Got to watch it,” I told my 
companions as we climbed back in- 
to the car. “Remember, when we 
get to Groovyland, I do all the 
talking.” 

“What is this Groovyland?” 
Drool demanded. 

“You’ll see.” 

TT Te moved through the tourist 
* * traffic and approached the 
glittering gates at a brisk crawl 
while I pondered his question. 

Once upon a time we were a na- 
tion of happy voyeurs . "Visually- 
oriented by the theatre, motion 
pictures and television, we were 
content to move through life as 
spectators, even at sporting events. 
We went to zoos, museums, aquari- 
ums. 

But the more we saw, the more 
jaded we became, and the more we 
resented the barriers. The foot- 
lights barred us from the stage, 
movies and television separated us 
from events by a screen, the bars 
kept us from the zoo animals, the 
museum exhibits and the fish in 
the aquariums were under glass, 
and the sporting events took place 



in stadia a half-mile away from 
our reserved seats. 

Everyone wants a seat on the 
fifty-yard line. At a parade, the 
biggest thrill is to be up close. 

As we got up tighter in our daily 
lives, the need to get up closer in 
our entertainment-escapes increas- 
ed. 

Came colonial Williamsburg, 
where you can actually walk down 
the reconstructed street of a pre- 
Revolutionary village. Came plane- 
tariums where the stars are still an 
illusion — but they surround you 
on all sides. Came Marineland 
where the fish leap out of the water 
and the seals and dolphins perform 
close enough to splash you. Came 
Disneyland, with its trips and hap- 
penings. 

Trips and happenings . Perhaps 
that’s the answer. The need to see 
combined with the need to be. To 
make viewing a personal experi- 
ence, to momentarily enjoy a feel- 
ing of actual participation. In this 
regimented, automated, digit-dial- 
ling, zip-coded impersonal world 
where the tedium is the message, 
we’re cut off from close contact 
with reality. So out of artifice, we 
construct our own. 

Drugs for trips, happenings for 
audience involvement. But drugs 
are dangerous and happenings de- 
manding. 

Hence Disneyland, with its safe 
and easy surrogates — synthetic 
trips to synthetic worlds,, happen-

ings where nothing really happens. 
That’s a lot. 

But Groovyland is the most. 

“The most!” I repeated to Drool, 
guiding him through the turnstile 
and laying out $22.50 for three ad- 
missions. 

“Why lay out all the loot?” 
Sandy asked. 

“Don’t worry, we’ll be rolling in 
it right after we set our deal here. 
But first I want to show Drool 
around a little. He ought to know 
what he’s getting into — it’s part 
of his education.” 

We got into plenty, but I don’t 
know how educational it was to our 
green-faced guest. 

Psycholand he didn’t dig at all. 
The idea of entering a fake mental 
hospital as a make-believe patient 
and getting a free personality-pro- 
file and a ten-minute analysis from 
a plastic psychiatrist while lying on 
a plastic couch just didn’t do any- 
thing for him. He wouldn’t try on 
a straitjacket or take an I.Q. test, 
nor was he interested in the com- 
puterized dating-rating. 

Sandy tried her best. “Why 
don’t you sit down and fill out the 
questions on this card?” she coax- 
ed. 

“What for?” 

“The machine will process your 
answers and indicate your best 
choice for a marriage partner. It’s 
what we call a computer match.” 

Drool shrugged. “Who wants to 
marry a computer?” he asked. 
GROOVYLAND 



T took him out of there fast and 
led him into Grislyland. i lie 
results here were hardly more en- 
couraging. The medieval torture 
devices left him cold; even the 
strappado didn’t give him a boot. 
Nor did he care for the Chamber 
of Horrors with its wax-figure crim- 
inals and its replicas of television 
comedians. 

“Try Heroland,” Sandy sug- 
gested, sensing Drool’s lack of in- 
terest. “He should get some jollies 
there.” 

I nodded. “Wait until he sees 
George Washington,” I said. 

Quickly we entered Heroland 
and I led Drool proudly over to the 
little auditorium where, as I re- 
membered, every fifteen minutes 
or so a remarkable event took 
place. Before the assembled audi- 
ence an amazingly clever animated 
figure of the Father of our Coun- 
try rose from a chair and walked 
to center stage, there to deliver 
Washington’s Second Inaugur- 
al Address. 

“This you’ve got to hearl” I 
told Drool, happily. 

But when we reached the audi- 
torium we found it deserted; the 
stage itself was bare. 

A bored attendant was sweeping 
the floor near the doorway and I 
collared him. “What gives?” I in- 
quired. “Where is Washington?” 

“Took him away yesterday,” the 
attendant informed me. 

“What a shame!” I glanced at 

25 




Drool. “I wanted you to see it — 
the most lifelike automaton you 
could ever imagine — ” 

“Too lifelike" the attendant vol- 
unteered. “That’s why they took 
him away." 

“What do you mean?” 

“Hear tell he was sold to a bunch 
of politicians. The way election 
campaigns are going nowadays, 
they figure to put this dummy on 
television, let him give his speech, 
and run him for governor." 

“Might have a chance at that,” 
I agreed. “Considering some of the 
speeches I’ve (heard other dummies 
make. After a 11, he’s got a good 
name and a familiar face. This is 
what they buy.” 

“Not those lemon-faced voters 
in Orange County,” Sandy remind- 
ed me. “The minute they remem- 
ber that Washington had some- 
thing to do with the Constitution, 
they’ll vote against him. He’s too 
left-wing for them.” 

She had a point there. 

But I was rapidly losing points 
with Drool. There was just one pos- 
sible way left to hook his attention, 
and I decided to take it. I dragged 
him over to Bodyland. 

Now all of the other lands in 
Groovyland are housed in separate 
buildings. Bodyland is different — 
because Bodyland is the building. 

Drool’s eyes bugged when he 
saw it, and frankly, I don’t blame 
him. Even though this wasn’t my 
first visit here, my eyes protruded. 



Picture a naked woman three 
hundred feet tall and proportion- 
ately proportioned, tipped over so 
that die is lying on her stomach. 
Fluorescent lights flash from her 
staring eyes as you approach her 
open mouth, and the lights blind 
you. Yet you must approach, be- 
cause that’s how you enter Body- 
land — through her mouth. 

“Step over the lower incisors,” I 
told Drool. “Then sit on her tongue 
and we’ll slide down her throat.” 
Sandy glanced across at me over 
Drool’s head and winked. It was 
unnecessary; I could already sense 
his kindled interest. 

'Together we seated ourselves on 
^ the pink, plushy surface of 
the tongue. Somewhere deep in- 
side the inner recesses of the giant 
figure, a motor began to hum. 
Slowly the tongue elevated at an 
angle, propelling us into the throat 
cavity beyond. 

“Duck your head,” I cautioned. 
“We’re coming to the tonsils!” 
They loomed overhead, brilliant- 
ly illuminated, and we passed them 
en route to the tunneling throat. It 
received us as we shot off the 
tongue and shot, at a steeper angle, 
along a neon-lit esophagus. Then 
we landed in the vast, hollow cav- 
ern of the stomach, its well-lighted 
lining disclosing a network of pas- 
sages on every side and overhead. 

Drool glanced around in open 
curiosity.

IF 




“Want to see the lungs?” I in- 
quired. 

He nodded quickly. “Oh, yes. 
Everything.” He turned to Sandy. 
“I never realized there was so much 
inside you.” 

“I’ve got a lot of guts, if that’s 
what you mean.” But Sandy wasn’t 
displeased by the observation. 
Quickly we led Drool on a con- 
ducted tour of the human anatomy 
— through the lungs, along the 
aorta into the ventricles, past the 
bronchia, then doubled back along 
a maze of veins. Pausing to wait 
for arterial traffic, I branched off 
into the liver, spleen and kidneys. 
Everything was well lit, and there 
were little signs on the walls of 
each organ or passage to chart our 
route. 

“Remarkable, isn’t it?” Drool 
beamed at me happily. 

“You’re getting the real inside 
story,” I assured him. “This exhib- 
it is endorsed by the Secretary of 
the Interior.” 

With plastic bone-structure and 
muscle-sheathing gleaming on all 
sides, we wound our way through 
the labyrinthine intricacies of can- 
als, ducts and sinus cavities until 
we were confronted with another 
corridor, darker and longer than 
the others. 

Sandy peered into it. “What’s 
this?” she queried. “One of the 
canals?” 

“Alimentary, my dear Watson,” 
I said. 

28 



Grasping her wrist, I started for- 
ward. “Join, hands now, because 
we’re going to loop the loop a few 
times, and we’ll need some intes- 
tinal traction.” 

“Isn’t there another way to go?.” 

For answer I pointed up at one 
of the small, neatly lettered signs 
— Please Exit Thru Rear . 

Climbing, clambering, then 
crawling, we did just that and fin- 
ally emerged again amidst Groovy- 
land’s vortex of vacationing visi- 
tors. 

“Satisfied?” I asked Drool. 

He nodded. “It was fascinating. 
Next time we must go to the 
head — ” 

“They don’t have one in there,” 
I informed him, then realized what 
he was referring to. “Yes, we’ll do 
that,” I amended quickly. “But 
right now we’ve got another head 
to visit. The head of this enter- 
prise — Sylvester Schlock.” 

VII 

Qylvester Schlock rose from be- 
^ hind his desk and threw his 
cigar at me. 

“How dare you?” he spluttered. 
“How dare you come to me with 
a proposition like this?” 

I shrugged with outward calm, 
but inwardly I echoed the question 
to myself. Approaching this fabu- 
lous showman had not been easy. 
For I, like all the world, knew the 
Schlock story. 



IF 




Sylvester Schlock was the most 
controversial figure in the world of 
show biz. His admirers said he was 
a self-made man. His enemies 
agreed, but pointed out that this 
merely indicated . what you got 
when you used cheap labor. 

His boosters stated that Schlock 
had been bom in a log cabin. His 
detractors reminded you that the 
log cabin had been built atop his 
father’s penthouse, where that mul- 
ti-millionaire eccentric chose to re- 
create a rural atmosphere. 

It is true, as Schlock’s friends 
state, that he worked his way 
through school. But it is also true, 
as enemies assert, that he had to do 
so because his father disowned him, 
and he had worked his way through 
medical college as a corpse-washer 
in a Forest Laundromat. 

. In any case, Sylvester Schlock 
graduated and began his practice 
as a physician. His supporters re- 
mind you that he gained a bril- 
liant reputation as a proctologist. 
His foes assert that the reason he 
gave up his spe cialty is because he 
could never identify his patients 
when they came face to face with 
him, and he took a dim view of hu- 
manity. 

Be that as it may, Schlock re- 
tired to an area east of Los Angeles, 
where he owned a thousand acres 
of barren desert land, and it was 
here that Groovyland was bom. 

At first he operated on the low- 
est level of entertainment — the 



roadside tourist trap. Crude sign- 
posts along the highway urged mo- 
torists to Visit The Monster Mu- 
seum! and Feed The Ravenous 
Reptiles! The monster museum 
turned out to be a small snake-pit 
Schlock stocked the pit with speci- 
mens he found wriggling over his 
own property, and the ravenous 
reptiles were merely toads or gecko 
lizards. But enough cars stopped 
and enough quarters poured in to 
enable Schlock to expand. He add- 
ed a tiny restaurant to his enter- 
prise. Here, his champions say, be 
attracted a growing clientele be- 
cause of the unusual flavor of his 
’burgers. His opponents admit the 
flavor was unusual, but hint he 
used the same source of supply for 
his food as he did for stocking his 
snake-pit. 

Snakeburgers or no, Schlock did 
have the only eatery in all that 
stretch of dreary desert — to say 
nothing of the only restrooms. 

To say that Groovyland was 
founded on the receipts from a pub- 
lic pay-toilet would be a vast over- 
simplification, but it is true that 
Schlock always gave the customers 
what they wanted. 

He next incorporated an amuse- 
ment park and carnival, not hesi- 
tating to use the lowest carny at- 
tractions. And it was here that his 
unusual genius for entertainment 
first came into play. Noting that 
people would pay money for almost 
anything — even to see a geek bite 

29 



GROOVYLAND 




the head off a chicken — Schlock 
added refinements. On Thanksgiv- 
ing Day he advertised that his 
geek would bite the head off a tur- 
key. And before long, just for the 
kiddies, he had a junior geek who 
bit the heads off canaries. 

S uccess breeds success, and 
from that point on Sylvester 
Schlock soared. He obtained fin- 
ancing and started Groovyland 
with its first major attraction — a 
typically phony frontier town 
which he called Tombstone Terri- 
tory. It had the usual livery stables 
and saloons for atmosphere, plus 
Central Casting cowboys, but 
Schlock added an extra. No doubt 
harking back to his pre-med days, 
he built a Boot Hill cemetery plot, 
with genuine tombstones. Here, 
driving around in the comfort of a 
Rent-a-Hearse, one could follow 
the progress of a daily western 
drama; see an outlaw apprehended 
for rustling cattle, watch his two- 
minute trial, attend the subsequent 
hanging (in which a very skilled 
stunt-man literally risked his neck 
at every performance) and then ob- 
serve the digging of a grave and 
the burial of the outlaw as a grand 
finale. 

Perhaps this is the point where 
Schlock really made his start. Cer- 
tainly it was a stroke of sheer gen- 
ius when he altered the program to 
include audience participation. 
Now, for a given fee, one could 



purchase tickets to join a posse and 
ride after the outlaw. Another tick- 
et entitled a customer to serve on 
the jury during the trial. For a con- 
siderable extra sum, some lucky 
member of the audience could play 
executioner during the hanging. 
And the biggest kick — at the larg- 
est price, of course — was to join 
the burial party and help dig the 
grave in which the outlaw was in- 
terred. 

Schlock had fathomed the secret 
at last, and now there was no stop- 
ping him. Within the next decade, 
Groovyland rose from the dusty 
desert like the pleasure dome of 
Kublai Khan. Came Monkeyland , 
where you put on the ape-suit and 
swung through the branches of the 
artificial trees; came all the other 
lands, plus facilities for weddings, 
christenings, conventions, bar mitz - 
vahs and actual burials in what was 
somewhat painfully described as a 
“real, live cemetery” adjoining the 
private landing-field. 

Finally, came The Hall of the 
Mountain King — a gigantic open- 
air cavern, with rocky walls mould- 
ed of genuine papier-mache , in 
which outdoor concerts were held 
every weekend. Here the top sing- 
ing stars performed, the hit com- 
bos, the Name Attractions. 

A booking at Groovyland could 
make a national reputation over- 
night and pave the way for tele- 
vision, a spot in Vegas, films, re- 
cordings, the works. So it was here,

naturally, that I determined to 
launch the career of the entity Fd 
introduced to Schlock as Sneed 
Hearn. 

No wonder he’d hurled his cigar 
at me. But now, as I stared into 
Sylvester Schlock’s heated coun- 
tenance, I came on cool. 

“He’s a great singer,” I said 
softly. “Wait until you hear him.” 

“This is a singer?” Schlock star- 
ed scornfully at Drool. “I can’t ev- 
en stand the sight of him, let alone 
the sound.” 

“What’s wrong with his looks?” 
Sandy inquired. 

“He’s green l” Schlock lifted his 
arms in an imploring gesture. “Do 
you think for a moment I’m going 
to put my audience at the mercy 
of some green kid?” 

T his, as we say in the industry, 
was my cue — and Drool’s. I 
signaled, he stepped forward, he 
opened his mouth. 

Out came a perfect reproduction 
of that smash singsational group, 
Vermin and the Varmints. 

Schlock reached for another ci- 
gar, but he didn’t throw it. He 
didn’t even light it, just sat wide- 
eyed and open-eared as Drool 
poured it on. 

Without pausing for breath. 
Drool launched into a second se- 
lection. This one, with an oriental 
beat, was Yogi and the Yo-Yos 
punching out What Makes Swami 
Run? 



Drool was just about ready id 
launch an imitation of Charlie 
Horse and the Bruised Tendons 
when Schlock’s dgar levelled in 
imperial command. 

“Stop!” he shouted. "Enough, 
already!” 

I noticed that the hand holding 
the cigar was shaking. So was Sch- 
lock’s head. “I don’t know how you 
do it, young man,” he jproaned, 
“but never in my life have I heard 
anything so atrocious, so abomin- 
able, so positively disgusting! In 
other words, you sound exactly 
like those groups you’re imitating. 
And if it’s bad enough few me, it’s 
good enough for the audience.” 
Pointing his Havana Xmperfecto 
at me, Schlock got down to busi- 
ness. “Our next big concert is 
scheduled for a week from Satur- 
day. What do you say to a spot 
for your boy at three G’s?” 

I shrugged. “Forget it.” 

Sandy gave me a glance that was 
strictly distress merchandise, but I 
ignored her. 

“Okay, five G’s but that’s my 
top quote, and I’ll want repeat op- 
tions on — ” 

“No,” I said. 

“But you can’t get any more the 
first time out, not even from the 
Sullivan Show — ” 

“No,” I repeated. “We don’t 
want any money.” 

Now both Sandy and Schlock 
were sending out distress signals. I 
smiled at them happily. 



GROOVYLAND

“We’ll let our boy perform for 
you absolutely free of charge,” I 
told him. “But on one condition.” 
“Name it.” 

“He’s not going to have a spot 
in your concert a week from Sat- 
urday. He is the concert.” 

“The whole show, all by him- 
self?” Schlock did something new 
with the cigar; he swallowed it. 

“What’s the matter, don’t you 
think it’s possible? You heard him.” 
“But — ” 

I brushed objections aside. “He 
can take the place of any solo 
singer, any singing group, any com- 
bination of instruments and instru- 
mentalists. What more do you 
need?” 

“I know,” Schlock conceded. 
“It’s just that a one-man concert 
is practically unheard of. Even the 
so-called one-man shows are usual- 
ly backed up by a supporting act 
to open the bill.” 

“My boy supports himself,” I 
said. “And if you’ll give him a 
chance, he’ll support you, too. This 
act is going to sell a lot of tickets.” 
“After they’ve heard him and 
the word gets around,” Schlock 
agreed. “But this first appearance, 
he’s an unknown quantity. I can’t 
advertise just Sneed Hearn in a 
one-man performance.” 

“Then bill him as a group,” I 
said. “After all, he is a group when 
he opens his mouth, isn’t he? Call 
him — oh, anything — ” 

Inspiration gleamed in Sylvester 



Schlock’s flashing eyes. “Sneed 
Hearn and his Hearnias!” he shout- 
ed. 

I gripped his hand. “Okay, we 
have a firm deal.” 

And thus, a star was bom. 

VIII 

'T'he ride back to Los Angeles 
1 was something of a triumph. 

“That was a stroke of genius, 
letting him go on for free the first 
time,” Sandy conceded. “After one 
exposure, you can name your own 
price. Joe, you’re a genius.” 

It is my policy never to contra- 
dict a lady, so I just nodded si- 
lently. But deep within myself I 
could feel the surge of supreme 
confidence. I knew now that noth- 
ing was beyond me; I could 
achieve the seemingly impossible. 
Right then and there I resolved to 
put my belief to the final test. The 
next time I stopped for a traffic 
light ou the Strip and a hippie 
came up to sell me a copy of The 
Free Press, I would sell him a copy 
of The Christian Science Monitor. 

My mood was heightened when 
we goi.back to the house and Sandy 
told the waiting group what had 
happened. 

“Incredible!” Luke Emia gasped. 
“Wait ’til they hear him!” 
“They’ll go outta their skulls,” 
Swinger predicted. 

“ I ” agreed Graf- 

itti.

IF 




I accepted the accolades with 
due modesty. After dinner I wan- 
dered out on the patio behind the 
house to compose myself and my 
thoughts. This was going to be a 
hectic week, and I had to plan a 
schedule. 

To my surprise, I found Drool 
standing there at the edge of the 
hilltop, staring up at the smog as 
though he could actually see the 
stars beyond. His face was expres- 
sionless. 

I moved up beside him. “What’s 
the matter?” 

“Nothing.” 

“Then cheer up. You’re on your 
way. You heard what Schlock said 
— with your looks and your voice 
you can’t missl” 

Drool blinked at me. “I still 
don’t see how I’m going to take 
over the world this way.” 

“Look,” I said. “It’s all a mat- 
ter of who has the clout, and in 
this world money is power. Your 
voice will make more money than 
anyone has ever dreamed of earn- 
ing. With it you can buy anything 
you want — ” 

“But I don’t want anything for 
myself. I’m* only here to follow or- 
ders. And my orders are to con- 
quer. If I just had my own lit- 
tle superdisintcgratosonic weap- 
on — ” 

“This is your weapon.” I pointed 
at his throat. “And for the moment, 
I’m your commanding officer. So 
forward march!” 



Luke Emia stepped forth from 
the shadows. “What’s this about g 
weapon?” he asked. 

I filled him in on Drool’s story. 

“Mean to tell me you haven’t 
investigated any further?” Luke 
gestured excitedly. “If Drool drop- 
ped this gizmo of his when he fell, 
it must have landed around here 
somewhere, just as he did. For all 
we know, it could be lying out in 
the street.” 

“Forget it,” I said. “Who needs 
weapons?” 

“We do! Why, if this thing has 
half the power he says it does, 
we’re wasting our time. We could 
sell a copy to the government for 
billions.” 

“Quit talking like a business 
man,” I told him. 

But Luke was carried away with 
his own vision. “Then we could 
turn around and sell another copy 
to the enemy powers for more bil- 
lions.” 

“Quit talking like a big business 
man,” I sighed. 

“I still think you’re making a 
mistake — ” 

I shook my head. “I’m making 
a star. From now on, we’re all go- 
ing to be concentrating on that con- 
cert. 

Beckoning to Drool, I moved to- 
ward the house. “Time to hit the 
sack,” I said. 

And we djd. Despite Drool’s pol- 
icy of letting sleeping-bags Be, he 
rested beside me all night. 



GROOVYLAND

■\X7hen morning came, we went to 
* * work. And that’s the story of 
the next ten days — work and more 
work. Grafitti wrote lyrics. Swinger 
did arrangements. With them I 
coached Drool on proper styles of 
delivery; how to slur his pronunci- 
ation and moan words incoherently, 
where to go off-key, and all the 
other techniques of today’s top vo- 
calists. Luke Emia and Sandy were 
kept busy loading platters on the 
stereo as Drool listened to the 
groups he’d be imitating — the 
Zappers, the Calamity Howlers, 
Rock Bottom and the Living Ends, 
and all the other great artists. 

“You’re a slave-driver,” Cy Kot- 
ic complained. “I don’t even have 
time to listen to the news any more. 
Because of you, I’ve missed two 
declarations of war, an epidemic, 
four riots, six mass-murders and 
nine tax increases. If I can’t keep 
up with these normal, every-day 
events, how can I stay in touch 
ivith reality?” 

Only Barf seemed satisfied with 
the schedule. He’d rearranged his 
habits so that he now slept all day 
and stayed awake all night. It was 
then, while the rest of us retired to 
our sleeping-bags, that he proceed- 
ed with his educational activities. 
He and Drool spent those noctur- 
nal hours in Barf’s room upstairs 
where the philosopher lived in a 
fashion once popular in square cir- 
cles. I’d never been invited to that 
room, but I know it contained 
34 



books, a writing desk, and even an 
old monophonic record-player. 

It was the sound of the latter 
which aroused me one midnight 
just at a time when I was about to 
entice Sandy over to my sleeping- 
bag to discuss the territorial im- 
perative. 

“What’s that?” I muttered, 
jumping up and taking the stairs^ 
two at a time. As I burst into Barf’s 
room the sound ceased. 

Drool was seated on the floor 
amidst a welter of records and 
books. Barf stood at the record- 
player, removing a disc. 

“What were you playing 
just now?” I demanded. 

Barf put the platter away. “Just 
a recording from my own collec- 
tion.” 

“Stop wasting Drool’s time. 
You’re supposed to be teaching him 
something worthwhile.” 

“But he is.” Drool indicated the 
volumes stacked up beside him on 
the floor. “He’s taught me a great 
deal about life in your world. 
We’ve been going through the en- 
cyclopedia, slowly. Three volumes 
a night — ” 

“Three volumes?” 

“Drool is a very fast reader,” 
Barf explained. “And a very fast 
listener, too. I answer questions as 
he goes along.” 

“What sort of questions?” I in- 
quired. 

“Well, we’re up to the letter P” 
Drool said. “So we’ve been discus- 



IF 




sing pathology and psychosis and 
poverty and plagues and pollution 
and population-explosion and prej- 
udice and Pop Art — ” He nodded 
reassuringly. “I’m beginning to un- 
derstand how you people live.” 

“I’ve just been discussing pub- 
lic opinion polls,” Barf explained. 
“For example, here’s one of the 
latest — a poll taken to determine 
whether or not people believe in 
polls — ” 

“Who needs it?” I glanced dis- 
approvingly at the book-shelves lin- 
ing the walls. 

“You think books are obsolete?” 
Drool asked, eagerly. “So does Mar- 
shall McLuhan. In fact, he wrote 
a book about it.” 

I gripped Drool’s shoulder and 
pulled him to his feet. “Come on,” 
I murmured. “You’re going down- 
stairs with me.” 

Barf looked confused. “Don’t 
you approve of my educational 
methods?” 

T shook my head. “Teach him the 
things he must know when he’s 
rich and successful. How to handle 
a sports-car with a right-hand drive, 
how to order a hamburger from a 
French menu, how to set up a tax- 
free foundation. That’s what he 
needs to learn — the practical 
stuffl With only a few days left 
before the concert, I don’t want 
his mind cluttered up with a lot of 
useless knowledge. Facts will only 
confuse him.” 



Barf gestured tentatively. “Are 
you quite sure this is what you 
want?” he said quietly. “In a world 
of chaos, can’t you think of any 
meaningful contribution besides 
more chaos?” 

“People want to get zonked,” I 
told him. “That’s what’s happen- 
ing, baby. You go with whatever 
turns you on.” 

“Maybe it’s time to turn off,” 
Barf mused. “Before we reach a 
point of no return, where sheer sen- 
sory impact loses meaning. We 
have no music any more — just the 
beat. Our abstract art is nothing 
but a series of Rorschach tests. 
When artists cease to communicate 
with their audiences, the ability to 
communicate is soon lost and all 
that matters is subjective sensa- 
tion, drug-induced. We have sold 
our birthright for a mess of pot.” 
“End of lecture,” I snapped, and 
dragged Drool downstairs. 

“But I like talking to him,” 
Drool protested. “He’s even taught 
me about warfare and strategy. Di- 
vide and conquer. To the victor be- 
longs the spoils. Don’t fire until 
you see the whites of their eyes. Oh, 
if I only had my superdisintegra- 
tosonic weapon now — I could take 
over in no time!” 

“You take over Saturday,” I re- 
minded. “By making a success of 
the concert. And until then, I’m 
calling the shots.” 

The remaining days" before the 
performance blended into a hyper- 

35 



GROOVYLAND 




active blur. Rehearsals and last- 
minute preparations occupied ev- 
ery waking moment and even in- 
vaded my dreams. 

If I’d taken time to reflect I 
probably would have kept a closer 
watch on my companions, but it 
didn’t occur to me. I was only 
vaguely aware that Luke Emia ab- 
sented himself from the house at 
regular intervals, and that Barf and 
Drool exchanged muttered conver- 
sations in the comer whenever they 
met. 

But I was too busy to check up. 
I spent hours on the horn with Syl- 
vester Schlock, going over the pub- 
licity and promotion for the con- 
cert, and additional hours with 
Swinger, Grafitti and Sandy, plan- 
ning the numbers to use in the pro- 
gram itself. 

By Friday evening I was a bas- 
ket case. “Tranquilizers don’t help 
any more,” I told Cy Kotic. “You 
were a doctor once. Can’t you do 
something to calm me down? Isn’t 
there some kind of operation — a 
pre-frontal lobotomy — ?” 

“This you need like a hole in 
the head,” he replied. “Now just 
relax. Tomorrow at this time it will 
all be forgotten. That’s your an- 
swer, the same answer I give all 
my patients. Just remember to for- 
get” 

It sounded like a great notion, 
and somehow it got me through the 
final night. 

Late that evening I wandered 



out on the patio with Drool and 
Sandy. The view was breath-taking. 
So was the smog. 

“Look!” Sandy gestured to the 
east. “Those lights, way off in the 
distance — isn’t that Groovyland?” 
“It’s all Groovyland,” I told her. 
“The whole world.” 

Drool nodded excitedly. “Just 
think — like tomorrow I’m going 
to conquer it!” 

“Sure,” I said, smiling at Sandy. 
I wasn’t worried about Drool and 
his predictions. As far as I was con- 
cerned, all this talk about conquest 
was just his schtick. 

The only trouble with schticks , 
of course, is that sometimes you 
wind up with the short end .

^nphey came to Groovyland on 
i Saturday night. 

They came by Cadillac and by 
pick-up truck, by station-wagon 
and by motorcycle, by sleek and 
shiny sports-car and by broken* 
down bus. They tangled the traffic 
on the freeway, turning the air 
blue with exhaust fumes and with 
curses. They jammed the parking- 
lot, jockeying for position as they 
smashed one another’s fenders. 
They glowered and glared, swore 
and snarled, then pushed and pum- 
meled their way into the lines be- 
fore the ticket-windows. Twenty 
thousand of them came, sweating 
and squirming and shrieking their

IF 




way into their seats. And why not? 
After all, they came here to have 
fun. 

We came for business; Luke 
Emia in his car, Barf, Swinger, 
Grafitti land Cy Kotic in a Volks- 
wagen. Sandy and Drool rode with 
me. Originally I’d intended to bring 
them all, but Luke pointed out the 
advantages of keeping extra trans- 
portation handy. 

“Suppose we need to make a fast 
get-away after the concert,” he 
said. 

“I don’t think you’re a bit fun- 
ny,” Sandy told him. But in the 
end, we split up and drove our sep- 
arate ways. 

While the others joined the aud- 
ience in the Hall of the Mountain 
King, Sandy and I conducted Drool 
backstage. 

“Up tight?” Sandy whispered to 
him. 

Drool shook his head and grin- 
ned. “Under control.” 

And why not? He didn’t have 
to scuffle for bread, because he 
didn’t eat. He didn’t need a fancy 
pad because he didn’t sleep. He 
was the quintessence of all that the 
gurus taught and the hippies 
sought — a completely non-in- 
volved entity who lived merely to 
do his thing. 

Maybe if I had his advantages 
I wouldn’t be here. I’d have turned 
Drool over to the scientists for 
study, let them examine his unique 
physiology and alien mentality. Or 



perhaps I’d just let him free to g5 
his own way in the world. 

But I did have to eat and I did 
need a pad, and my thing was ev- 
erybody’s thing — do unto others 
before they do unto you. 

So I was here, and I was nervous. 
Jostling through the narrow cor- 
ridor behind the outdoor stage, we 
came to the tiny cubicle which 
served as Sylvester Schlock’s tem- 
porary headquarters for the eve- 
ning. He bounded into the hall and 
grasped my hand. 

“DM you see the crowd?” he de- 
manded. “Beautiful!” 

I stared into the office over his 
shoulder. “So is that,” I told him. 

The floor of the little room was 
stacked with canvas bags stuffed 
with coins and currency; loose bills 
and loose change cascaded from 
their containers, brought here from 
the box-offices. 

“Twenty thousand customers at 
three bucks a throw,” Schlock mur- 
mured. “Sixty thousand on one 
concert alone. And if your boy 
makes it big tonight — ” 

“He will,” I promised. “Just 
keep an eye on him.” 

“Sorry,” said Schlock. “I’ve got 
to stay here and keep an eye on 
the loot. I never mix business with 
pleasure, and watching money like 
this is a pleasure, believe me.” 
“But I thought you were going 
to introduce our star — ” 

“There’s a mike on stage. Why 
don’t you do the honors?” Schlock 



GROOVYLAND

waved me forward. “Better start 
soon, that mob is getting restless.” 

Oandy squeezed my hand. I 
^ squeezed back. And then, 
somehow I was out there under the 
lights, under the scrutiny of twenty 
thousand pairs of watchful eyes. 
And I was singing something about, 
“Tonight we bring you a new era 
in entertainment — a new star 
straight from the heavens — Sneed 
Hearn! ” 

The applause rose, and Drool 
stepped onstage, moving to the 
microphone and bowing. 

“This is it,” I whispered. “Re- 
member — all systems go!” 

“I’ll lay it on them,” Drool 
promised. 

I left the stage, perspiring. 

Drool stood under the spotlight, 
grinning. 

The crowd fell silent, waiting. 

Ill never forget that moment; 
the hushed, still moment of expec- 
tancy. 

And I’ll never forget the moment 
that followed it; the moment when 
Drool opened his mouth. 

Drool opened his mouth and the 
music came out It poured and 
pulsed, surged and soared. 

It wasn’t just the sound of a vo- 
calist and a small combo — the ma- 
jestic strains issuing from that 
tiny throat were the unmistakable 
utterance of a mighty orchestra 
and full chorus. 

“Holy Toledo!” Schlock moaned. 



“No,” I corrected. “That’s not 
it. What he’s laying on them is 
Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony!” 

Schlock may have groaned 
again; if so I didn’t hear it, for the 
sound was drowned in the greater 9 
groan of the audience. Even Beeth- 
oven was lost in the impromptu 
chorale of boos, hisses, shouts and 
catcalls. 

“Get him off before they mur- 
der him!” Schlock shrieked, push- 
ing me onstage. 

I got him off. “Come on,” I mut- 
tered, grabbing Drool by the nape 
of his neck. “They’re starting to 
throw things.” And indeed they 
were. I dodged a pizza hurled by 
an indignant music-lover and duck- 
ed a beer-bottle aimed at me by 
another patron of the arts. 

“What’s the matter?” Drool 
quavered. “Why don’t they like it? 
Barf told me they would — ” 

“Barf?” I shook my head, but 
the picture was clear now, only too 
clear. That two-bit philosopher had 
corrupted our boy with classical 
music on his own record-player, se- 
duced him into symphonies. “Wait 
until I get my hands on him!” I 
promised. 

But wait we would. Right now 
the important thing was to keep 
that angry crowd out front from 
getting their hands on us. 

Somehow I propelled Drool into 
the wings. The audience was rising, 
converging on the stage amidst a 
thunder of rage. 



38 



IF 




The thunder was split by the 
lightning of Sandy’s scream. 

“No!” she wailed. “Stop — ” 

I glanced up quickly, then 
blinked in sudden shock. Apparent- 
ly Barf wasn’t the only traitor in 
our midst. 

TT'or there, standing beside the 
^ little offstage cubicle where 
the box-office receipts rested, was 
Luke Emia. As Schlock and Sandy 
raised their hands high in helpless 
surrender, Luke moved forward to 
cover them with — 

“My superdisintegratosonic weap- 
on!” Drool squealed happily. “He 
found it!” 

Which explained Luke’s interest 
when he questioned me about the 
lost weapon, explained his absence 
during recent evenings when he 
went out to hunt for it in the can- 
yon brush near the house. It also 
explained why he’d suggested we 
drive here tonight in separate cars. 
He had the weapon, and now he 
had the caper: holding up the place 
for the concert receipts. 

“Stand back!” Luke warned. 
“Don’t anybody move — ” 

The words came too late, for 
Drool was already ducking under 
his arm, tugging at the oddly 
shaped, rifle-like object in Luke’s 
hands. Luke pulled the trigger — 
Then it was in Drool’s hands, 
just as the weapon went off. Drool 
jerked the muzzle aside just in 
time to avoid the puff of greenish 

GROOVYLANl) 



smoke which burst forth and coal- 
esced into — 

Another Drool, standing side by 
side with his exact counter-part, an 
identical twin Drool holding an 
identical weapon from which a puff 
of greenish smoke burst forth to 
coalesce into a third Drool — 
“Stop!” I shouted. 

“Not until I conquer the world,” 
Drool gurgled. 

“With that thing? It doesn’t kill 
anyone!” 

“Never said it did,” Drool 
shrugged. “All it does is reproduce.” 
“You mean it duplicates?” 
“Reproduces,” Drool corrected 
me. “How do you think Krool man- 
aged to have four million off- 
spring?” 

Another greenish puff and from 
it, another Drool — then another 
and another — 

“That’s the secret of taking over 
the world,” the Drools chorused. 
“Divide and conquer.” 

A rumbling roar from the plat- 
form behind us indicated another 
kind of problem. 

“It’s the audience!” Schlock 
cried. “They’re storming the stage 
— they’ll tear us to pieces — ” 
“Don’t worry,” said the Drools 
in unison. “We outnumber them.” 
Then six Drools turned and 
marched onstage, raising six weap- 
ons. Six puffs coalesced and as the 
crowd shrank back there were 
twelve Drools facing them. Twelve 
weapons raised, and now the twelve 

39 




became twenty-four. Twenty-four 
became forty-eight and forty-eight 
became ninety-six and ninety-six 
became a hundred and ninety-two 
and a hundred and ninety-two be 
came an army and the army be- 
came — 

But you get the idea. 

So did I. 

Grabbing Sandy’s hand, I ran for 
it. 

X 

Tt is very quiet here. 

Sandy and I stopped to plunder 
a refreshment stand on our way,

and I think we have a big enough 
stock of provisions to last us in- 
definitely. 

That’s good, because I’m not 
sure we’re ever going to come out 
again. 

At the rate Drool was reproduc- 
ing himself, he may well have man- 
aged to take over the world by 
sheer weight of numerical suprem- 
acy alone. 

And I can just see it now — 
everybody knee-deep in masses of 
Drools, rising higher and higher un- 
til they smother. It’s the final pop- 
ulation explosion, I suppose. 

And since Drools don’t eat or 
sleep or have much need of oxygen, 
there’s no reason to suppose they’ll 
ever stop multiplying. If they ever 
get the idea to start singing in uni- 
son, the sound-waves will topple 
every man-made structure on earth. 
Oh, there’s no end to the possibil- 
ities. 

But meanwhile, Sandy and I 
will stay here, where it’s safe and 
quiet. Here, in Bodyland, in the 
one hiding-place that we can depend 
on. 

We’re back in the womb. 

Some day, when it’s all over, we 
may venture out again, just to see 
what happened. Right now I like 
it here, and I’m not about to move. 
The way things are now, Drool can 
have his world. 

It’s a nice place to visit, but I 
wouldn’t want to live there .

IF . and WHEN 

by LESTER DEL REY 



Let There 



fphe Martian Invasion seems to 
be coming to an end. It was 
a long war, lasting for decades, and 
often a brilliant one of countless 
facets. Great ships plied space be- 
tween Earth and Mars, filling the 
void with every conceivable ray and 
missile. Millions of gallant men and 
alien Martians of every kind and 
description died. The sands of Mars 
grew colorful with blood — red 
blood, green blood, you-name-it 
blood. The seas of Earth were 
looted for water and boiled away 
a thousand times. But now the 
ancient war is nearly over, and not 
even a conference table is left to 
mark its attrition. 

At least that seems to be true in 
the science-fiction magazines. This 
month, for example, Chapdelaine’s 
Spork is busy with humans and 



Be Light 



aliens in an entire solar system, but 
the system is not that of our sun. 
Robert Bloch brings us a little 
green man, but not from Mars. 
And C. C. MacApp’s ship with its 
crew and strange ship minds voy- 
ages far from Earth — but not to- 
ward any planet of our system. 

Perhaps it’s a pity. We’ll miss the 
loveliness of Dejah Thoris and the 
sad, haunting Martian cities of 
Leigh Brackett. But science fiction 
still depends on a genuine respect 
for the basic facts of science, and 
our present knowledge rules out 
any chance for technical, intelligent 
races of the solar planets except 
Earth. 

We can’t rule out the possibility 
of life on some of the other planets 
— even some that seem pretty 
hostile. But if such life does exist, 



41 





as most scientists hope, it must be 
composed largely of rather primi- 
tive plant and very low orders of 
animal forms. 

Most of the general public aren’t 
ready to accept that yet. The flying- 
saucer groups just about have to 
have nearby aliens to make the 
constant coming and going of their 
illusive (and in my opinion, illu- 
sionary) craft possible. But even the 
more conservative public clings to 
the belief in solar aliens. Whenever 
I address a group not composed of 
science-fiction fans, most of the 
audience stubbornly refuse to give 
up their feared but beloved Mar- 
tians. 

They are now pointing out, quite 
correctly, that newspapers have re- 
ported that the astronauts who 
circled the Moon couldn’t find any 
visible evidence of technical, intel- 
ligent life on Earth. Hence, it seems 
to most people that we can’t pos- 
sibly know enough about other 
planets to rule out such life there. 

It sounds logical, but the argu- 
ment won’t hold water. The catch 
lies in that often-omitted word, vis- 
ible. There was a tremendous 
amount of evidence of technical, 
intelligent life on Earth available to 
those astronauts. They were bom- 
barded by beams of high-frequency 
radio signals that required a well- 
developed technology and carried 
information in an ordered form that 
had to denote intelligence. We’re 
no longer limited to that tiny part 



of the spectrum usable by our eyes. 
And any other technical race in our 
system would be filling space with 
evidence that we could detect. 

AT ercury has always been con- 
-*“*-*“ sidered a pretty poor place 
for life to flourish. Lying only 36 
million miles from the sun, it was 
once supposed to turn only one face 
toward that searing light, leaving 
the hot side at the temperature of 
molten tin while the other froze 
at almost absolute zero. A few 
stories had life in a thin Twilight 
Zone that wobbled back and forth 
between light and dark, but even 
that area was troublesome because 
Mercury was supposed to have no 
atmosphere. 

Our current picture leaves much 
of this in doubt. The latest find- 
ings indicate that Mercury revolves 
in a way that turns all of the sur- 
face beneath the great solar orb, and 
that there is some kincl of thin at- 
mosphere. 

But the new knowledge doesn’t 
make life more probable. We know 
now that the light from the sun is 
accompanied by fantastic energy 
radiation of other kinds, such as 
highly charged particles that would 
be fatal even to electronic robots 
and would never permit life to form 
there. 

Venus remains largely a mystery, 
despite the American and Russian 
probes. These have given us a pic- 
ture of a planet with a tremendous 

IF 



42 




blanket of atmosphere under high 
pressure and a temperature above 
500°F. Initial indications are also 
that this temperature is fairly uni- 
form over the entire planet, also. 
It would obviously predude any life 
we can imagine. 

Yet there are some doubts. While 
much of the atmosphere seems to 
be composed of carbon-dioxide gas, 
the Russian probe did indicate that 
there were slight traces of free oxy- 
gen and water vapor. Some scien- 
tists have calculated that even this 
small amount of oxygen could not 
exist at such high temperatures un- 
less there were plant forms to break 
down the carbon-dioxide and release 
the oxygen regularly into the at- 
mosphere. If so, the plant life must 
be scarce and located mostly around 
the polar regions. Certainly there 
isn’t enough oxygen for any high 
level of animal activity to exist 
there. 

*\>Tars remains the hopes of most 
extraterrestrial doters. And 
there is a good reason for that. The 
fantastically successful flight of 
Mariner IV around that planet gave 
us a lot of information and showed 
us that Mars was pitted with cra- 
ters like the Moon, but it did not 
make conditions quite so bad that 
life was impossible there. 

We know that the planet has an 
atmosphere; we can even see 
clouds in it, and locate what is best 
explained as a thin layer of frost 
IF . AND WHEN 



or ice that accumulates in winter 
at the poles. The results of tests by 
Mariner force us to admit that 
there can be very little oxygen or 
water vapor in the air of Mars — 
but that little might still support 
some life. 

Our visual evidence tends to in- 
dicate that such life does exist. 
There have been elaborate theories 
of odd chemical crystals to account 
for the fact that each summer green 
spreads rapidly over one hemisphere 
of Mars, to die off with the coming 
of winter. But those theories run 
into difficulties when they have to 
account for other factors. We see 
storms that must be dust storms on 
Mars. These blot out the green — 
but it pops up again quickly, as it 
would if growing plants forced their 
way through dust deposits. Anyhow, 
the most economical theory as to 
unprovable assumptions is that 
there is life there. 

The canals, incidentally — or 
properly, the channels (canali) — 
are no evidence of anything, be- 
cause They’re as subject to debate 
as the existence of life. There’s no 
certain evidence that they are more 
than accidental illusions caused by 
certain vague markings on the plan- 
et; and the evidence of Mariner 
IV tends somewhat to be against 
their existence. 

Scientists on Earth have even 
demonstrated that some Earth life 
could exist under Martian condi- 
tions. Lichens — composed of algae 

43 




and fungi living together symbiotic- 
ally — and some other simple plants 
have been grown at simulated Mar- 
tian conditions — and even a few 
primitive animal forms have sur- 
vived there. 

But this has nothing to do with 
technology and intelligence. No 
early technology would be possible 
to give rise to a higher culture. In 
that atmosphere, fire would be im- 
possible. And most primitive tech- 
nology grows out of the use of fire, 
leading to metals, glass and all the 
other artifacts needed to handle the 
things that come later and don’t 
require fire for their shaping. 

The same poor atmosphere would 
limit the activity of any animal to 
the point where the Earth sloth 
would seem like a bolt of lightning 
in motion. There simply isn’t 
enough free oxygen to supply the 
energy for great activity. Brains 
would be excess baggage that 
couldn’t be supported; such a col- 
lection of energy-consuming cells 
not immediately necessary to raw 
existence would be too great a lux- 
ury for the environment, and would 
never evolve. 

Tn the long run, the level of energy 
* available to the organism is 
probably the most important con- 
sideration in the development of 
higher life forms. Too much of it 
in the environment would speed up 
certain processes until no living bal- 
ance could be struck. Too little 



limits the organism to the dreariest 
need for pure animal efficiency to 
exist at all. Even evolution must be 
limited by the energy supply, and 
such evolution on a world with little 
oxygen for animal life would obvi- 
ate any chance for intelligent brains. 

Of course, there are other proces- 
ses that don’t involve the oxygen 
from an atmosphere, such as fer- 
mentation. But these are less effi- 
cient and yield less energy; and all 
life forms that use such processes 
on Earth are extremely primitive; 
most also depend on food from 
plants that can benefit from the 
high levels of energy available by 
photosynthesis on Earth, where the 
sunlight level is high without being 
lethal. 

This need for a source of energy 
suitable for biological use makes 
life in even the most primitive form 
unlikely on the planets beyond 
Mars. The moons of Jupiter receive 
less light and warmth by far than 
does Mars, so that even plant life 
there may be impossible. And the 
largest of these moons — Ganyme- 
de — is smaller than Mars, and less 
capable of holding a rich atmo- 
sphere. 

Jupiter itself remains an enigma. 
With more than ten times the di- 
ameter of Earth, it has retained an 
enormous atmosphere from which 
even the hydrogen has not vanish- 
ed into space. Its huge gravity grips 
every gas molecule firmly, and the 
sun is so far away — almost half 

IF 



44 




a billion miles — that little energy 
is conveyed to those molecules to 
speed them up to velocities that 
could break from the planet’s pull. 
We can see only the surface here, 
and our instrument readings leave 
many factors in doubt. If one 
theory is correct, Jupiter is far too 
cold to provide the energy needed 
by life. But there are other theories, 
involving the slow escape of radio- 
active heat from such a giant at- 
mosphere and the odd behavior of 
the gases in it, which make the 
amount of free energy unpredict- 
able at present. If any planet be- 
yond Mars can support life, it must 
be Jupiter. But while the physics of 
energy are uncertain, the chemis- 
try of biological processes offers us 
no real hope of any life there either. 

Saturn and the other planets fur- 
ther out must be dead. There could 
never have been enough energy 
available on them for the first or- 
ganic chemicals that build living 
matter to form. 

T ittle by little, science has tak- 
' en away our hope of finding 
alien enemies and friends in our 
system. But there are compensa- 
tions. Forty years ago, when science 
fiction was just beginning in the 
magazines, all the speculations of 
science indicated that the chance 
of life beyond the solar system was 
almost exactly zero. At the time, 
the only theory we had to account 
for the existence of planets around 



our sun was so complicated that we 
could expect no other star in the 
entire galaxy to have similar plan- 
ets. And we didn’t have any idea 
at all as to how life could evolve 
spontaneously on even our own 
planet. 

Now. we know better. We’ve dem- 
onstrated experimentally that life 
is almost certain to evolve, and we 
have theories which indicate that 
the formation of planets is a natur- 
al and common thing for stars. Bet- 
ter still, we have evidence that 
other stars do have planets. So far, 
the other planets we have discover- 
ed are huge, bearing little resem- 
blance to Earth, but they help to 
prove that planets are not unique 
to our system. 

Today, it’s not too optimistic to 
believe that most stars somewhat 
like our sun — and there are a vast 
number of them — have planetary 
systems. Our current theories indi- 
cate that many of those systems 
must include a planet not too dis- 
similar to ours, and that such plan- 
ets almost certainly will have life. 

There must have been other in- 
telligent races in the past. There 
surely will he other intelligent 
races in the future. The only ques- 
tion is whether intelligence has 
enough survival value for another 
race — or for us — to survive until 
we can get together. 

But we have to allow some op- 
timism in our science fiction, after

With Gerlik insane, Ben Tomsun 
had to take over the Ship. But 
no sensible man would help him. 



I 

TT'rom Deck Ten, where the 
" pines grew, it was fifteen 
hundred feet up to the sunlamps on 
the steel bottom of Sea Deck. That 
was not, of course three times as 
hard a climb as the five hundred 



feet between lower decks, because 
deck-gravity — a full gee at soil- 
level — tapered off quickly above 
any deck. Then, too, the rope lad- 
der here only hung to a platform 
six hundred feet up in a vast old 
pine beside the circular hatchway 
called Central Well. By the time 



47 





one reached that platform, gravity 
was less than half a gee, treetops 
and parasitic flowers were burgeon- 
ing joyously, and a vigorous young 
man need hardly pause for breath 
before starting up the ladder. 

Pryingboy Thorp was already 
near the top of the ladder, preced- 
ing, as a Watch Corporal should, 
the five men of his squad. The 
lamp-heat — not too much of it 
directed toward Central Well — 
was delicious on his skin. He loved 
this trip — had, in fact, pestered 
superiors brashly to get assigned 
permanently to Sea Deck patrol. 
He loved the colorful, per fumy 
mass of vegetation, and even more 
the feel, this far up the ladder, of 
virtual free-fall. 

How thrilling it must have been 
for his ancestors, in times before 
the Catastrophe, to don those leg- 
endary pressure-suits and go com- 
pletely outside the sinus — out- 
side the Ship, even! 

Just below the edge of Sea Deck, 
while he \pas st ^ weightless, he 
paused to look down at his squad. 
Kail, Waran, Arden, and Pender- 
gast were spaced along the ladder, 
with Muller still on the platform 
as rear guard. 

Pry went a rung higher. Care- 
fully, because sudden weight could 
play tricks with one’s co-ordination 
he reached up, grasped a knoblike 
thing that had once been an interi- 
or eye of the Ship, and pulled him- 
self onto the narrow ledgelike shelf 
48 



that ran around the inner curve of 
Sea Deck’s central retaining-wall. 
His renewed weight felt enormous 
at first. He leaned against the wall 
until dizziness passed, then climb- 
ed a battered steel ladder mid sat 
straddling the fifteen-foof-high 
wall. The acrysteel was cool be- 
tween his thighs. 

He glanced around at the circu- 
lar sea. Light glinted off wavelets 
stirred by influx-air. There was a 
smell of fish and sea-plants. 

From an excrescence on the steel 
a few feet away came one of the 
Voices of the insane Ship. “This is 
Captain Gerlik. I feel your electri- 
cal capacitance. By your mass, you 
must be a grown man. I bless you, 
my son! Though I am deaf and 
blind where you are, I bless you.” 
Another voice cut in for a fe®£ mo- 
ments, mouthing gibferish, then 
Gerlik’s voice returned. “Though 
the universe has passed away, I 
shall maintain . .-. ” The sound 
dribbled away into a mutter and 
stopped, as if the speaker had for- 
gotten Pry. He shivered a little. He 
knew the voices were only the 
minds and personalities of long- 
dead people transcribed into the 
Ship’s computers, but they were 
eerie. 

He wondered why the first 
rebels, ten or twelve generations 
ago, hadn’t smashed this communi- 
cator-outlet along with others. May- 
be they’d needed to know whether 
the Ship stayed alive at all. 



IF 




'T'his space — called Middle 
Void — was the biggest in 
Sinus B, unless there might be big- 
ger ones in the dark, uninhabited, 
unreachable other half. From where 
he sat, by turning his head be 
could see the entire enclosing curve 
of the sinus wall. Sinus B, the tat- 
tered old books said, was a long 
cylinder closed at both ends, hash- 
ed across at intervals with decks 
having their own artificial gravi- 
ties, and with various ingresses, 
ducts, fittings and buried machin- 
ery. He knew the dimensions by 
heart. Fifteen thousand feet long; 
four thousand in diameter; with 
the hundred-foot-wide holes in each 
deck that comprised Central Well, 

There were no overhead lamps 
here in Middle Void. The lamps 
were in a ring around the sinus 
wall, fifteen hundred feet above the 
water. They provided light and 
heat not only for that round ocean, 
but also for Upsidedown Sea, three 
thousand feet above his head. 

He tilted back his head and 
stared up. Had that half of the sin- 
us been peopled too, at some time? 
No record remained, and the round 
hole in the middle of Upsidedown 
Sea — surely the continuation of 
Central Well — was perpetually 
dark. 

It wasn’t likely anyone would 
ever reach there now, because three 
thousand feet was much too far to 
build a ladder or to catapult a 
grappling-hook, even aside from the 
MAD SHIP 



complications of inverted gravity. 

There were sounds below hfaa, 
and Fathersface Kail climbed the 
wall. He grinned at Pry and asked, 
“All right if I dunk?” 

“Sure,” Pry said, and watched 
enviously as the other dropped to 
the shallows and began to splash 
about. The Ship maintained the 
water at a comfortable temperature, 
the better for the fish crop. But as 
Corporal, Pry must stay alert. 

Not that there was ever any- 
thing to observe, except some citi- 
zen trying to fish illegally, or a too- 
thick growth of seaweed. It was 
two hundred years since the last 
Ship’s stooge tried to sneak in, and 
almost as long since the last robot 
machine appeared. General opinion 
was that there was no longer any- 
one alive outside Sinus B, and no 
’pairbots still operating. Neverthe- 
less, he must be watchful. 

The rest of the squad arrived one 
by one — Troublechild Waran, 
Secondboy Arden, Baldbaby Pen- 
dergast — who, however he’d been 
born, was far from bald now — 
and Jamestwo Muller — the oldest 
man of the squad, who was begin- 
ning to be bald. They all joined 
Kail in the water. 

After a while Waran climbed up 
beside Pry. Waran was the young- 
est of the squad, barely nineteen. 
He stared up at Upsidedown Sea. 
“Why aren’t there any fish up 
there?” 

Pry gave him an amused glance. 

49 




“Maybe there are. They’d have to 
be pretty big to see at that dis- 
tance. Did you ever hear of a fish 
five or six feet long?” 

Waran flushed a little and grin- 
ned. “No.” He was, quiet for a min- 
ute. “If the gravity ever failed up 
there, all that water would fall on 
us, and some would pour down Cen- 
tral Well! Why is the gravity up- 
side-down there, do you suppose?” 
Pry, who’d wondered often 
enough, shrugged. “Maybe that’s 
part of the Ship’s madness. Or may- 
be it was designed that way when 
the Ship left Earth.” 

.Waran said softly, “Eight hun- 
dred years! And now Earth’s gone, 
with the rest of the universe. How 
long do you suppose the Ship will 
last? And will it ever war upon us 
again? It could stop recycling air, 
or leave the plant nutrients out. It 
could leave the sunlamps off, or — 
or poison the water!” 

Pry, irritated, got to his feet. He 
began shedding his backpack and 
Other gear. “Then I suppose we’d 
all die.” He started around the top 
of the retaining-wall. “I’m going to 
have a look at the other side.” He 
went carefully — one certainly 
didn’t want to fall down Central 
Well — but tried to act noncha- 
lant. The sensible thing, of course, 
would be to drop to the water and 
swim or wade; but, except for War- 
an, the squad were all older than 
Pry and he didn’t want to show 
timidity. 

50 



II 

Hphe shallows near the opposite 
1 curve of the retaining-wall 
were normal. 

Or were they? His stomach tight- 
ened suddenly. That shape out 
there, distorted to view by the sur- 
face and the waves — was it a man 
lying on the bottom? 

Drowned men don’t stay sub- 
merged. 

He dove and swam, after shout- 
ing for his squad. The thing had 
arms and legs, certainly, but... 
Then he was close enough to see 
that it was some kind of limp gar- 
ment — one that would cover a man 
all over. Skin prickling, he threw 
a look up toward the black hole in 
the middle of Upsidedown Sea; 
then, arching himself, he dove and 
seized an arm of the garment. It 
felt slick, like the few scraps of old 
plastic that still existed. 

His men gathered around, tread- 
ing water. Waran, eyes wide, asked 
in an awed voice, “What is it?” 

Pry’s own voice was shaky. “It’s 
a pressure-suit! It was right here, 
on the bottom. There’s not enough 
current to have moved it, and it 
wasn’t here yesterday; so, an in- 
truder’s come into the sinus some- 
time during the last dark-cycle 
here!” 

Muller said hoarsely, “There 
aren’t any more people outside the 
sinus! It must have been some 
kind of robot!” 



IF 




Pry said impatiently, “A robot 
wouldn’t need a pressure-suit. They 
'don’t breathe, and they have their 
own grav-lifts. So there are people 
out there after all!” He began tow- 
ing the suit toward the retaining- 
wall. 

. There was no more talk until 
they pulled themselves from the 
water. Then Muller asked, more 
reasonably, “But why would he 
abandon it? Do you suppose he 
drowned? Or maybe the suit just 
fell from up there I” 

Pry suppressed annoyance. “How 
could that happen, with the gravity 
reversed up there? Do you see any 
water falling this way?” 

Muller grinned. “No. But why 
would he abandon it?” 

“Because,” Pry said, “he’s trying 
to pose as — as one of the people! 
Maybe in the dark, he didn’t real- 
ize the suit could be seen from the 
retaining-wall. But he’s gone some- 
where below. He could be hiding 
on Deck Ten. Or lower.” 

Waran tasked shakily, “What 
would he want?” 

Pry shook his head slowly. “As a 
stooge of the Ship, he may have 
been sent to prepare the way for 
some sort of invasion; or he might 
be here just as a spy.” 

Muller growled, “He won’t find 
spying easy! Are we going to search 
Deck Ten?” 

“No. Not until we get reinforce- 
ments.” Pry stared upward. “First 
of all we’re going to send word 
MAD SHIP 



down to Deck One; then I want to 
get this thing out of sight in case 
someone or something’s watching 
from — from up there.” He looked 
at Muller. “You probably know 
more people on the various decks 
than any of us do. You take the 
word down. Tell a few people along 
the way, but no strangers; and 
don’t delay getting down to Deck 
One. You’ll have to climb down 
through four or five ladders in the 
dark.” 

Muller shrugged. “I’ve done that 
plenty of times. Shall I say any- 
thing else except ...” 

Pry shook his head. “Just what’s 
happened.” In case Muller were 
intercepted by the intruder — who 
might have unimaginable weapons, 
hypnotic drugs, anything — it 
would be better to keep the report 
vague. 

AyTuller nodded and hurried to 
-*“*-■* ward the down-ladder. 

“I wonder,” Waran said softly, 
“what he’ll look like? If he’ll be 
normal, I mean.” He eyed the suit 
which, with the water drained out 
of it, was surprisingly light. “One 
thing — he’s bigl” 

Pry looked again at the suit. 
“Yes. There were four sizes of pres- 
sure-suit, and this must be the big- 
gest. We’ll have to be really alert! 
Kail, you and Waran stay up here 
on watch. Pendergast, you go down 
to the tree-platform on Deck Ten 
as a lookout. Arden, you follow 

51 




me down. Both of you make sure 
your knives are loose in the scab- 
bardsl ” 

Pendergast turned, then hesita- 
ted. “How are you going to carry 
the suit? If he’s skulking some- 
where, watching the ropes, he’ll see 
it!” 

Pry told him, “I’m going to 
bundle it up and stuff it in my 
backpack. If we all act casual, even 
if he does see us he may not sus- 
pect anything.” 

The plastic of the suit — brown- 
ish-yellow stuff — seemed incred- 
ibly thin to ward off the terrors of 
open space, "though those might be 
exaggerated in the old tales. There 
were many thickened parts of the 
suit, including a thick ridge around 
the waist, where things were im- 
bedded. There were loops for at- 
taching things. The helmet was 
semi-rigid, with a horizontal win- 
dow of clear yellow glass. There 
were instruments sealed into the 
helmet, and several turns of wire 
completely around it near the’ 
crown. No doubt it had radio and 
all the other legendary things. 

But it made a small enough 
bundle to get in a backpack. Pry 
walked around to the ladder, 
glanced to make sure Arden was 
following and started down. 

There was five hundred feet or 
more of clear air before he was 
among lacelike tendrils of vine, and 
glad even of that tenuous cover. 
Then he reached the flaring pine- 



tops and paused to let his eyes ad- 
just to dimmer light. 

This was a dim fairy-world, with 
the light from the sunlamps heav- 
ily screened by foliage. Birds that 
would have had to beat their wings 
hard in full gravity soared easily 
here, or hovered with rasual wing- 
beats. Squirrels made magnificent 
slow leaps from branch to branch. 
There was a distinct ecology of 
small animals at this level — even 
cats took advantage of the thick 
foliage and low gravity, eating what 
they could catch, drinking water 
that collected in upturned blossoms 
during the gentle dark-cycle rains. 

Pry continued on down. Gravity 
increased. The pine-trunks became 
thick and gnarled, the branches 
fewer and the light dimmer. He 
joined Pendergast on the platform. 
“Hear anything?” 

“No. Shall I go on down?” 

“Yes.” Pry waited while the old- 
er man climbed down the ladder 
of pegs driven into the treetrank. 
When Pendergast set foot on the 
ground and signalled up, Pry could 
see him only dimly by light coming 
in laterally from Central Well. Pry 
went down and they strode the 
short distance to the retaining-awll 
of this deck. Pry turned to peer 
into the gloomy forest. “My guess 
is, he went farther down while it 
was dark/’ 

He couldn’t be sure, but be 
shrugged and sent Pendergast down 
the next ladder.

IF 




D eck Nine, five hundred feet be- 
low Deck Ten, had a thinner 
layer of soil suitable for wheat. It 
was in day-cycle now, but wouldn’t 
be for long. Pry, stepping off the 
ladder, stood with his hip against 
the retaining-wall — a low one, here 
— and stared around at the sinus 
wall. Intervening low hills hid the 
base of it and the rim of trees along 
it — willows taking advantage of 
the peripheral drain-off ditch. 
There’d have to be a search there 
when enough guardsmen arrived. 

The sunlamps were hot. One 
quadrant of wheat, to his left, was 
nearly ripe. Directly before him 
was a greener quadrant, while to 
the right was a crop of alfalfa to 
re-liven the soil. On the far side of 
Central Well was the newly-plowed 
sector. He’d scrutinized all four 
quadrants, of course, as he came 
down the ladder. 

He waited for Arden to join him 
and Pendergast. “Wait here a min- 
ute, the two of you I’m going to 
look at those tracks in the ripe 
sector.” 

The tracks, two sets of them, led 
away from the retaining-wall. A lit- 
tle way out, one set zigzagged, while 
the other mote or less pursued. 
That might mean some girl leading 
her man friend on a laughing chase; 
no one lived on the grain decks, 
but anyone could visit. 

At the best, the pair who’d made 
these tracks had trampled grain un- 
necessarily. 

54 



Pry followed the tracks to a low 
hummock. Partway up the slope, 
one set continued straight on over 
while the other turned back — re- 
tracing carefully to avoid trampling 
more wheat, which was proper. 
Stepping in the continuing tracks 
for the same reason, Pry followed 
them up the hummock. 

From the top he could see the 
body sprawled face up in the wheat 
beyond. An area of flattened grain 
indicated she’d fallen, gotten up to 
stagger a few steps, and fallen 
again. He shouted for Pendergast 
and Arden, then ran toward the 
girl. 

She was perhaps in her early 
twenties, slight, dark-haired. She 
wore a tunic of green cloth that left 
her tanned arms and legs bare. Her 
moccasins were scuffed. Her hands 
showed signs of moderate work. 
Pry guessed she might be from 
Deck Four or Deck Five, where 
people lived in the fruit-orchards. 

She lay limp, her breathing slow, 
but Pry saw no sign of injury. Care- 
fully he rolled her over and winced 
at a round stain of blood on her 
garment, just at the back of the 
left arm-hole. Pendergast, coming 
alongside, grunted. Pry reached 
under the cloth. There was a small 
hard object half-imbedded in the 
flesh. Gently, he pulled it free and 
looked at it. 

Arden gasped. 

The thing was a very slim bullet 
— hardly more than a half-inch 

IF 




needle. Pry looked up at the other 
two men. “This is a hypodermic 
bullet! Do you remember the pic- 
tures and descriptions of the pis- 
tols?” 

He gently pressed her garment 
against the tiny wound to make sure 
she wasn’t bleeding any more, then 
got bandage-cloth and a bit of dry 
balsam from his belt-pouch, washed 
her wound with water from his can- 
teen, rubbed the balsam against the 
still-wet skin and plastered on a bit 
of doth. Then he got to his feet 
and stared toward the rope ladder. 
It seemed very likely that the in- 
truder had gone down at least one 
deck farther. “You two stand guard 
at the ladder. I’ll try to revive her.” 

Ill 

TTTithin half an hour she began 
* * to stir, moaned and tried to 
gather her arms under her. Pry 
knelt quickly. “Lie still! I think 
you’ll feel better in a few minutes.” 

She stiffened, but obeyed. Her 
breathing strengthened. Presently 
she lifted her head enough to see 
him. “Oh!” she said in a surprised, 
relieved tone. Her brown eyes, 
though, showed fright. 

“What happened to you?” he 
asked. 

She drew in her breath. “I — I’d 
just come up to inspect the wheat. 
A man was standing a little way 
from the ladder. I nodded and he 
nodded back, and I walked along 

MAD SHIP 



the retaining-wall to the ripe sec- 
tor. I must have stopped and look- 
ed back at him too curiously. He 

— he acted a little odd, and he was 

— was pale; not tanned. I thought 
he might be some hermit from 
Deck Ten. Then he ran toward me 
and I saw something in his hand, 
a sort of pistol, like the pictures in 
the old books. I ran and tried to 
dodge, and he followed me. I felt 
a sting at the back of my shoulder. 
I tried to get across a hummock, 
hoping he wouldn’t follow, and 
then . and then I began to feel 
weak. I guess I went a little way 
and fell down.” 

“You fell twice,” Pry told her, 
and felt foolish. “What did he look 
like?” 

“Just — j’ust pale. He was clean- 
shaved, and his hair was cut short. 
He wore ordinary clothes like any- 
one. Anyone on the orchard decks, 
I mean.” 

“Was he big?” 

“Yes. An inch or more taller 
than you, and heavier. I thought 
it was odd that such a muscular 
man wouldn’t be tanned.” 

Pry felt a stir of pique. He was 
considered muscular enough him- 
self. He demanded, “Did you see 
him go back to the ladder?” 

“No. I didn’t look back until I 
was beyond the hummock, then I 

— Do you think he’s still on this 
deck?” 

“No, I don’t. I think he went 
farther down.” 



55 




Her eyes widened. “Somebody 
has to give the alarm! Obviously, 
with that pistol, he’s a — a stooge! ” 
Pry felt that he was scowling at 
her. “I’ve already sent a messenger 
down. Come on, if you can walk 
now. We’ll build a fire near the 
ladder.” 

She looked puzzled. “A fire?” 
“The upper decks will be dark 
by now, and before long this one 
will, too. I don’t want to risk start- 
ing down in the dark until reinforce- 
ments get here.” He flushed, re- 
alizing she might interpret that as 
cowardice. “In this backpack I’ve 
got the suit he came down in. I 
can’t risk his getting it back. With- 
out if, at least he’s trapped in our 
half of the sinus.” 

She stared at him for a minute. 
“Ah! You mean a pressure-suitl 
Where did you — ” 

“We found it on Sea Deck.” He 
helped her to her feet, and urged 
her toward the ladder. 

nphere was, as on all decks, a 
small pile of firewood near 
the ladder, since patrols were like- 
ly to camp on any deck through the 
dark-cycle. Pendergast got busy 
with a firebow and soon had a blaze 
going. 

The girl looked fairly well re- 
covered by now, and Pry ques- 
tioned her some more. “Didn’t 
you bring a canteen up with you, 
or anything? 

“Yes, a standard kit. I left it 



near the ladder rather than carry 
it with me. I guess he took it” 
Pry stared away for a minute. 
“Fine,” he said sourly. “Anything 
to help out his disguise. Well, we’ll 
feed you. I don’t want to send you 
down the ladders in your condition 
in the dark. Where do you live? 
On one of the orchard decks? 

She flushed, a little angry. “Deck 
Five. I can get down all right!” 
“No. There’ll be men coming up 
the ladders anyway, and you’d 
slow them down. Besides, I need 
you here, in case some superior of 
mine comes up and wants to ques- 
tion you. You’re the only person, 
so far as we know, who’s seen the 
intruder.” 

She shrugged coldly and settled 
herself against the retaining-wall, 
not looking at him. He felt a little 
ashamed of his gruffness. 

Deck Nine was ghostly when the 
sunlamps went out. There was al- 
most no light from Central Well, 
since decks Five and everything 
higher were in darkness too. The 
fire illuminated a short curve of the 
retaining-wall and a small half-cir- 
cle of the grainfield. Cool influx- 
air was wafting down from the 
ducts between the dark sunlamps. 
He realized that he and his com- 
panions would be here when the 
rain started; but on a grain deck it 
was a mere drizzle. 

He waited impatiently. Rein- 
forcements ought to be here by 
now! Finally he got up, threw a 

IF 



56 




leg over the retaining-wall and took 
a firm grip on the few rungs of 
metal ladder that were an ancient 
fixture here. 

The girl was on her feet staring 
at him. “Are you going down? I 
thought — ” 

He grinned at the concern in her 
voice. “No. I'm just going to lean 
out and look down. There'll be 
torches, if men are coming up.” He 
let his body hang as far out as his 
arm would stretch. 

H is skin began to prickle. Some- 
thing was unfamiliar about 
Central Well. Then he gasped. 
There was no light at all — no dim 
rings of luminosity marking the 
lowest decks, which should be out 
of the staggered dark-cycle before 
now. No light at all! Or — was that 
a torch? 

The tiny point of light winked 
off, then on, then off again. He 
read the signal, half-mumbling it 
over to himself. Presently he pulled 
himself up and back over the wall 
into the welcome firelight. 

All three companions stared at 
his face. He said slowly, “All the 
lamps are off, clear down to Deck 
One. There’s a signal fire there, 
directly below Central Well. They 
say no one knows what the trouble 
is. They order all guardsmen to 
stay on post, wherever they are.” 
There was a shocked silence. 
Finally Pendergast asked, “What 
did they say about Muller?” 

MAD SHIP 



“Nothing. That may be just cau- 
tion, but I think — well, I don’t 
think he ever got to them! I think 
he was intercepted. I think he’s ly- 
ing somewhere unconscious, or — 
or dead!” He raised his voice be- 
cause the tightness in his chest 
made it hard to speak softly. “Do 
you see the significance of the 
lamps all being off at once? The 
Ship’s co-operating with its stooge 
— making things easier for him. 
Maybe even without the suit he 
has some way of communicating 
with it. Or maybe they’re working 
on a prearranged schedule!” 

The girl said in a low, slightly 
unsteady voice, “We can’t live 
without the sunlamps.” 

Pry looked at her half -blindly. 
He had to get that suit down to 
Deck One, along with word of 
what was happening. He moved to 
the wall again. “I’m going down. 
Now!” 

But before he touched the wall 
he stopped, rigid with a thought. 
After a moment he laughed hoarse- 

iy- 

“What’s funny?” Pendergast de- 
manded sourly. 

Pry said, “I’m an idiot! Here 
I’m thinking of climbing down sev- 
eral thousand feet of dark ladder, 
carrying in my backpack a suit 
that has grav-lifts. Why don’t I sim- 
ply put it on and float down?” 
The trio stared at him. Finally 
the girl said, “You don’t know how 
to operate it I” 



57 




“I can learn ! A few experi- 
ments — ” 

“But,” she said hastily, as if she 
were worried about him and sought 
any argument, “suppose he inter- 
cepts you? He may have ways of 
seeing in the dark. Then — then 
he’ll get the suit back!” 

He said, “First he’ll have to see 
me, then he’ll have to reach me. 
And then he’ll have to take it 
back!” His heart was pounding 
now. Why hadn’t it occurred to him 
before to put on the suit? He 
shrugged off the backpack. “What’s 
your name?” he asked the girl. 
“Maybe, if they’ve built bonfires 
on Deck Five by now, I’ll stop and 
tell them you’re all right!” 

She glared at him. Finally she 
said, “Marytwo Garth.” 

He pulled the suit from the pack 
and let it fall loose. The closure 
down the front was open. He thrust 
in one leg, then the other. He 
pulled the helmet over his head, 
worked his arms into place and 
tugged the front together. He felt 
for the small knob that was the 
closure-closer and began to pull. 
And the suit spoke to him. 

IV 

r A fter his first frozen moment of 
startlement, he realized it 
was only a communicator built in- 
to the helmet. The voice sounded 
human, but it wasn’t Captain Ger- 
lik’s. 

58 



“Hello,” it said again, “who are 
you?” 

It still took him a while to find 
his voice. Then he said guardedly, 
“I’m a citizen of Sinus B. Who are 
you?" 

The voice chuckled. “I know 
you’re a citizen of the sinus. What’s 
become of the man who wore this 
suit a few hours ago?” 

Pry’s mind raced. Did the suit 
have any way of destroying him? 
Could the owner of the voice tell 
precisely where the suit was, or see 
via it? Pry said cautiously, “We 
have him under control.” 

“Oh,” the voice said. “Well, my 
name when I was alive was Ben 
Tomsun. I’m one of the personal- 
ities programmed into the Ship. 
You people evidently believe the 
whole Ship’s insane. Parts of it are. 
There were schisms at the time of 
the Catastrophe, and the comput- 
ers divided into at least four fac- 
tions, located in different parts of 
the Ship. Several of the nineteen 
human personalities programmed in 
were destroyed. Others went insane, 
in a way peculiar to a half-machine, 
half-human intelligence. Two who 
retained joint control of Sinus B 
warred against each other, and your 
own ancestors suffered greatly un- 
til they quite reasonably rebelled 
and seized your half of the sinus. 
Are you listening?” 

Pry felt as if his stomach were 
full of active beetles. “Yesl” 
“Good. Captain Gerlik eventual- 

IF 




ly overcame the other mad person- 
ality, or absorbed it — even now we 
aren’t sure about some things. 
There are parts of the ship under 
our control — mine and several col- 
leagues’. There are live, sane, 
healthy humans in the forward part 
of the Ship, which is called Nose 
Cone and contains Sinus A. With 
them and what few repair robots 
and other facilities remain, we — 
the sane computer-personalities — 
have gradually been repairing the 
Ship and getting ready to seize con- 
trol of all of it, if possible. We had 
to work very carefully, because 
Captain Gerlik can still wreck your 
end of Sinus B. You have been 
hostages.” The voice paused “May- 
be this all sounds like gibberish to 
you. Have you any knowledge of 
computers, and of the Ship’s life- 
environment machinery?” 

Pry was irritated, and still not 
sure he wasn’t talking to a clever 
madman. He said stiffly, “We have 
a few books left. I’ve read them.” 

There was a hint of a chuckle 
from the voice. 

“Fine; fine. From time to time 
in the past — not within the last 
few generations — we’ve been able 
to send human agents by a cir- 
cuituous route into Sinus B. Some 
have been intercepted by robot 
machines under Gerlik’s control. 
The rest were all killed by our 
people.” The voice took on a wor- 
ried note. “You haven’t killed the 
present one, have you?” 

MAD SHIP 



P ry thought it wise to say, 
“No. 

“Don’t, please l The safety of 
your whole people depends on him! ” 
After a moment the voice added, 
“Or upon you ” 

Pry wondered if he heard right- 
ly. “Upon . me? 

The voice sighed. “Yes. Since 
we’ve had so little success sending 
envoys to your people, we decided 
— once we were able to clear a 
route for another attempt — to try 
to enlist one of you as an envoy to 
us. That was the aim of our present 
agent. Now it seems that you — I 
wish you’d tell me your name, and 
what position you occupy in your 
society — have voluntarily climbed 
into that suit. It occurs to me that 
you might be willing and qualified 
to come visit us and learn certain 
things for yourself. Then you could 
return and persuade others. What 
do you think of that?” 

Pry swallowed hard and stared 
through the yellow window of the 
helmet at his two men and the girl. 
Their faces showed that they’d been 
hearing every word. “I... don’t 
know. What is it you — you’d want 
me to see?” 

“Various things. First of all, that 
there are sane people who retain 
the knowledge and technology your 
ancestors had before the Catastro- 
phe. And that they trust me — us. 
That would be a big thing for your 
people to know, wouldn’t it?” 
“Well — yes.” 



59 




“Then are you willing to try? To 
come outside Sinus B and visit us 
in Nose Cone? I won’t lie to you 
— the trip will be dangerous. Ger- 
lik has resources, and he regards us 
as infidels, and will destroy any 
messenger between us and you, if 
he can, as you would step on a 
poisonous insect You still have in- 
sects in Sinus B, I think.” 

“We have insects.” Pry’s mind 
was kneading. If there were noth- 
ing hut the danger described — if 
it had been only a perilous ad- 
venture — how eagerly he’d acceptl 
But his whole people were at stake. 
Anything the voice said might be 
a lie. 

Once the Ship had him in its 
control outside the sinus, might it 
not tamper with his mind in some 
way? Could it not bend him to its 
own insanity, and send him back 
as a subtle poison for his own 
people? 

If he only knewl If he could 
only make a reasonable guessl 
“Well? the voice said gently. 
Pry writhed. “I don’t know I I 
couldn’t operate this suit anyway!” 
That was true enough. 

The voice chuckled again. “Why 
are you wearing it, then? But it’s 
only a matter of a few simple in- 
structions from me, and a few 
trials by you. Why are you so re- 
luctant? Are you afraid?” 

“No! Not the way you mean.” 
The voice sighed. “Then you 
think I’m lying. 

64 



■pry moaned. He daren’t say yes, 
and to say no wouldn’t help 
him any. He reached with a trem- 
bling hand — awkward enough any- 
way, because of the gauntlet — for 
the closure-knob, thinking he had 
to get out of the suit or go mad. 
But the voice said, “How could we 
use you to harm your people? Sup- 
pose we could brain-wash you — 
I guess that would be possible, if 
we had the desire. At worst, you’d 
go back to your people with false 
beliefs. They wouldn’t be brain- 
washed. Wouldn’t they simply dis- 
believe?” There was a pause. 
“Here — to show our good faith, 
I’ll turn the lamps on!” 

The deck was suddenly bathed 
in light. Pry, his eyes protected by 
the yellow glass, saw Pendergast, 
Arden, and the girl blink. 

The voice said, “With the lights 
on, your people will see you leave 
and return. What else are you wor- 
ried about? That we’ll infect you 
with some deadly disease? Think 
— if we, or Captain Gerlik for that 
matter, wanted to destroy your 
people or beat them to their knees, 
we could do it by tinkering with 
your environment. Do you see 
that?” 

“Yes. I — that’s true!” 

The voice sighed. “Here’s an- 
other point. You say you have our 
present agent under control. He’ll 
be a hostage for your own return. 
Does that help?” 

Pry was almost sobbing by now. 

IF 




He ought to wait for his superiors 
to arrive — they’d be coming, now 
that there was light — and leave 
the decision to them. But they’d 
take the suit away from him, and 
send someone else, even if they 
did believe the voice. He was too 
junior in the guard . Slowly, his 
hand dropped from the closure- 
knob. 

Anyone else who went would run 
the same risks, and bo the same 
risk. 

He drew in his breath sharply. 
“How do you operate this suit?” 

The voice that called itself Ben 
Tomsun was talking steadily. “Put 
your left hand on the rows of little 
bumps on the left breast of the 
suit. The row across the top con- 
trols the grav-lifts. Pressing the 
first from the left and the first from 
the right will set up automatic 
neutralization of any gravity you’re 
in, so that in effect you weigh noth- 
ing. Now — ” 

Pry’s heart was thudding. He 
might be a traitor or he might not; 
but he was going through with this 
or die! He neutralized his weight; 
he pushed very gently with his 
feet and floated upward, then 
pressed bumps and floated down. 
“I’ve got that! Now how do I — ” 

The controls weren’t complicat- 
ed, once they’d been explained. In 
fifteen minutes he was ready to 
launch himself up Central Well. He 
waved a jaunty hand at the trio 
standing by the rope ladder and 

MAD SHIP 



grinned at them through the hel- 
met window. Pendergast and Arden 
stood rigid, staring at him with 
ludicrous expressions that com- 
bined awe, disapproval and envy. 
The girl’s face was harder to read. 
There was a trace of concern, plus, 
perhaps, admiration. 

V 

^Iphe first bit of difficulty came 
when he had to turn over 
halfway through Middle Void, so 
he’d be dropping feet-first toward 
Upsidedown Sea. The suit had a 
built-in resistance to any change 
of head-and-foot alignment that had 
to be counter-acted. Once he 
achieved it, though, he knew he 
could do it easily next time. 

The retaining-wall around the 
hatchway in that other sea was id- 
entical with the one he knew — 
except that its sensors and com- 
municators were undamaged. He 
cringed a little when Captain Ger- 
lik’s voice assailed him. “Faithless 
one! Traitor! What devil’s-work 
have you perpetrated among my 
people? You shall be punished; do 
not doubt it. You shall burn 
through all eternity! Yea, though 
Heaven and Earth perish ...” The 
voice faded into mumblings. 

The voice of Ben Tomsun whis- 
pered in his helmet. “Pay no at- 
tention and keep moving slowly. 
He can’t interpret sanely what he 
sees or hears.” 



61 




Later, at Ben Tomsun’s direction, 
Pry turned on lights — one that 
fanned out in all directions from 
his helmet, another that lanced 
straight ahead so he could see far- 
ther. He dropped through a space 
that must correspond to the one 
above Deck Ten. His light-beam 
made a dim oval on nearly-bare 
soil. He asked hesitantly, “Is it all 
right if I—” 

Ben Tomsun said quietly, “Take 
a few minutes to look around. It’s 
best you know how things are.” 
Pry moved laterally from Central 
Well and hovered a few feet above 
the lifeless deck. 

There had been trees here — 
tall ones, but not pines. A few 
forked trunks thrust upward like 
supplicating skeletons. Mostly, 
though, only stumps remained, 
chopped off a few feet above 
ground, the axe-marks showing 
clearly. The wood was darkened 
and splintered, with strange de- 
posits of some kind that glittered 
in the light-beam. He said to Ben 
Tomsun, “There’s something here 
like broken glass.” 

“Ice,” the voice told him. “I 
guess you’ve never seen it before. 
There’ve been no sunlamps here 
for two centuries. Air circulates 
through, but isn’t warmed. Where 
are you now? Do you see the metal 
ladder on the retaining-wall?” 
“No. I’m on the opposite side.” 
Tomsun suggested, “Cross over 
and look at the dead camp.” 



P ry complied, and found what 
Tomsun wanted him to see. 
There’d been people, all right: 
He hovered, staring down and puz* 
zling thing out. There was chopped 
ffrewood, and the ancient remains 
of many fires. So that was what had 
happened to most of the trees. 

He realized suddenly that these 
folk must have kept a vigil here, 
on the highest deck they could 
reach, during a long perpetual night. 
Had they stared up at his own half 
of the sinus, where there was still 
sometimes light? 

They must have been near star- 
vation at the last; all of the fifty 
or more corpses were horribly 
emaciated — mere skin draped over 
bones. 

But they hadn’t all died of star- 
vation. Moving slowly, directing his 
beam about, Pry gradually built up 
the story. Many had died in a single 
way — by having their skulls split 
open with an axe. Blood had long 
since turned to a solid dark stuff. 
He found the axe that had done it, 
and the wielder. 

Angry horror formed within him. 
Had the man been insane? Had he 
obeyed some raving of Captain 
Gerlik? Or... had he turned to 
cannibalism? 

No, there was no sign of that. 
The killer had apparently com- 
pleted his work, then leaned the 
axe against a stump and lain down 
nearby. 

Then Pry saw the knife in the

mmms 



corpse’s chest, with the fingers of 
the right hand still clenched around 
the hilt. Finally he saw the bit of 
paper clutched in the shrunken 
spidery fingers of the left hand. 

So they’d all been dying, and one 
— with enough vigor left — had 
gone around finishing them off 
quickly, then killed himself. They 
must have consented; there was no 
sign of struggle. 

An awful thing. But at least they 
hadn’t descended to cannibalism. 
Pry choked on emotion. He ought, 
he knew, to go down and try to 
work that scrap of paper free from 
the dead hand to read the last mes- 
sage. But he couldn’t bring himself 
to it — not now. If things turned 
out right, he might do it on the way 
home; or someone else would do it 
later. 

Slowly, in a carefully-controlled 
voice, he described the scene to Ben 
Tomsun, who’d never had a com- 
plete description before. When he 
was finished, Ben Tomsun answer- 
ed as slowly. “It’s about as I’d 
thought. And it would have been 
so easy to rescue them, if we hadn’t 
been prevented! So easyl” There 
was a pause. “Well, you’d better 
hurry on. You have to go down 
five more decks, then out to the 
sinus wall. Be very watchful — 
keep turning your beam in all dir- 
ections. If anything moves, get away 
from it fast!” 

Pry nodded, more than to obey 
that advice.

sphere was dead soil and lifeless 
remains of plants on the; 
next two decks. On the third one 
down, there seemed to have been a 
fire. That was an orchard-deck, and 
everything was charred to stumps. 

The next deck down had known 



not only fire, but something worse. 
One whole side of the deck was 
buckled upward. Soil had been 
thrown aside, leaving bare steel. Ice 
had formed there. The sinus wall 
was pleated like a bit of doth. 

It was the next deck down, 
though, that showed the full force 
of the Catastrophe. Where the an- 
us wall had joined the deck, jagged 
talons of acrysteel splayed upward. 
The sinus wall had bulged far out 
and ruptured here, leaving scraps 
of itself attached to the deck. 

It was through that toothed gap 
that Pry had to go. Beyond was 
darkness that swallowed up his 
beam. • 

Ben Tomsun said, “Move about 
and direct your light through at 
various angles. If you see anything 
move, turn off your lights and re- 
treat!” 

Pry did as he was instructed. But 
there was no hint of movement out- 
side. Ten minutes later he went 
through the hole. 

He paused there, awed. He’d 
understood that Sinus B was en- 
closed within another cylinder that 
was the outer hull of the Ship, but 
he’d had no conception of the dis- 
tance between. His light couldn’t 

IF 




VI 



probe it. Near him, the light slash- 
ed across great columns like steel 
bars ten feet thick. Then, seeing 
ragged holes in one of them, he 
realized they were hollow. 

Tomsun’s voice said very quiet- 
ly, “You may as well take time to 
go out and look at the hull. We 
won’t be ready to meet you for half 
an hour anyway.” 

“All right.” Pry manipulated 
suit-controls. He must have travel- 
led four hundred feet before his 
Kght showed a steel wall, badly 
rumpled and belled outward. In two 
places, great patches of thick steel 
plate had been welded on — to 
close up ruptures, he supposed. One 
of the columns which, he realized 
now, were supports fixing Sinus B 
within the outer hull had been 
pulled apart by the awful force, and 
was crudely pieced together with 
welded-on girders. 

So the hull had bulged outward , 
not inward! He’d been thinking of 
the damage as some blow from out- 
side. Instead, it must have started 
with terrible heat; there was plenty 
of other evidence of that. The soft- 
ened hull must have been swelled 
outward by the air-pressure within 
and ruptured in the two spots. The 
same thing had apparently happen- 
ed to the sinus wall. 

He shivered. How had the Ship 
kept any , of its air? Then he real- 
ized how small those ruptures were 
compared to the immense volume 
of the Ship. 

MAD SHIP 



T) en Tomsun’s voice cut into hfa 
^ musing. “Where are you now?! 
Can you describe anything unique 
near you?” 

Pry nodded. 

“Yes. There are two patches, 
a steel column that’s been mended 
near the outer hull.” 

“That’s adequate,” Ben Tomsun 
said. “Drift down to the sinus waD 
a hundred yards from the base of 
that column, and on the opposite 
side of it from the patches. By 
swinging your light from side to 
side you can see the curve of the 
sinus wall. Give yourself partial 
weight so you can walk and come 
along it toward the fore aid of the 
ship. That’s back toward Deck One, 
I hope you haven’t lost your sense 
of direction.” 

Pry mulled that over confusedly 
for a minute. “Oh. I’m all rf^it, 
I guess — only I didn’t know Deck 
One was at the fore of Sinus B1 
I — we — supposed it was the op- 
posite!” 

“No; it’s forward. If you stray 
off-line, I’ll correct you. We can 
sense you on the sinus wall; that’s 
why I want you to walk. But he 
alert — Captain Gerlik can sense 
you too! Swing your light constant- 
ly and look behind you. Avoid 
any place that might be an ambush, 
such as the bases of the trave- 
columns.” The voice paused. “You 
are in a compartment now that’s 

65 




seven-hundred-fifty feet long, and 
you’re near the aft end of it. 
When you reach the forward bulk- 
head, there’ll be a hatch to come 
through. I’ll open it long enough 
for you to slip through. [The danger 
is lids: Gerlik has pairbots of var- 
ious sizes in the aft end of the Ship 
that are still operative, and he may 
try to intercept you. We’ll know 
if they roll along the sinus wall; 
but if any can fly, we have no way 
of detecting them. You’ll see var- 
ious stalled machines along the way. 
Don’t worry about them unless they 
move, but detour around them. 
Some may be able to swing a tool 
or a tentacle, or even throw things. 
But any attack is most likely to 
come from the rear, and there’s 
only your alertness to rely upon if 
he has flyable machines. Do you 
understand?.” 

Pry said, “Yes. But there’s one 
thing — can’t he overhear us talk- 
ing?” 

“No, unless you pass near one of 
the wrecked machines. Some of 
them may still have working sen- 
sors. Now, I’d like to be able to 
send a strong escort to meet you, 
but that won’t be possible for two 
or three hours, if at all; there are 
skirmishes going on right now in 
several different parts of the Ship, 
and we simply don’t have weapons 
enough to spare. Our actual hope 
is that Captain Gerlik won’t con- 
sider you important epough to 
waste resources on. He won’t know 



you’re a Sinus-B dweller, we think 
— he’ll think you’re the same agent 
returning. All right?” 

Pry tinned his head to cast the 
light-beam about him. It seemed 
hardly to scratch the oppressive 
darkness. “All right. Shall I start?” 
“You’d better.” 

P ry swerved around the fractured 
trave-column and slanted down 
to the sinus wall. He gave 
himself - half-weight and started 
along at a fast walk. The suit hard- 
ly hindered him at all — and that 
was a puz zlin g thing. How did it 
lift or move him, or vary his weight 
in effect Without tugging at his 
armpits or crotch? It must gener- 
ate some sort of field that worked 
upon everything in it, or within a 
certain space. What ancient theory 
he’d seen hadn’t explained it. 

He carefully skirted another col- 
umn and paused to swing his light 
about him. It dimly showed other 
columns at various distances. He 
started on, swinging it ahead of 
him — and suddenly stopped in a 
crouch. What was that his beam 
had slashed across? 

He found the object again — an 
assortment of booms, levers, and 
tentacles mounted on a low three- 
wheeled base. He’d never seen a 
picture of that kind of repair-ro- 
bot, but it couldn’t be anything 
else. Was it stirring? Heart thump- 
ing, left hand resting shakily on his

Spork 

and the 
Beast

Illustrated by REESE 



How could aii unintelligent beast 
be superior to the brilliant Ayor? 



I 

S tars can be bright, merciless 
pins. Especially when one is 
floating free among their sharp 
needle-points,, sans ship, sans nour- 
ishment and sans oxygen. 



We had striven mightily to over- 
come the telekinetic effects of the 
strange, unknown beast which lay 
somewhere around or beyond the 
third planet’s orbit Dingon, who 
had far stronger telekmass — mass- 
sensing and telekinetic — faculties

than I, had brought his own tiny 
figui -eight-shaped form to the 
very brink of exhaustion in carrying 
my larger human-shaped mass as 
well as warm air beyond the reach 
of the seemingly irresistible beast. 

Dingon could easily have made 
the trip back to Enithra in some 
twelve jumps. My body’s greater 
demands for oxygen and our in- 
ability to replace energy consumed 
by each jump had stopped us here 
in outer space. On Enithra, Dingon 
and I would have more or less 
automatically replaced energy 
drains from the life and food sur- 
rounding us; here, no such complex 
energy proteins were available. 

There we were — five million 
miles from home. We were sur- 
rounded by only a slight film of 
air, our ship had disappeared some- 
where in the direction of the third 
planet and soon, though we had 
escaped the terrible clutch of the 
beast’s telekinetic fidd, we too 
would probably be scattered in fine 
partides throughout the universe. 

Time passed and anoxia approach- 
ed. My mind dwelt most natural- 
ly on home — Enithra — and its 
lush violets and ultra-violets, its 
eternally seeking mass-sensing and 
telekinetic plant and animal life, 
our successful struggles against our 
hereditary enemies, the Tepen, and 
our grouping decision to study and 
to utilize direct phenomenon as 
well as indirect — tdekmass — 
phenomenon. 

70 



nphough I am human in form, I 
am Ayorian to my tiniest cell 
and I love our Enithra with every 
part of my body. 

When my biological mother and 
father crashed on Enithra I was but 
six months old. Erne, one of the 
figure-eight Ayorians, noted that my 
neuronic structure was incomplete, 
preventing me from utilizing tdek- 
mass faculties. She helped me com- 
plete my growth, then accepted me 
as her twinning problem. 

Each Ayorian must make a per- 
sonal committment aimed at dther 
solving some philosophical, scien- 
tific, or other type of problem. 
When successfully solved, that Ayo- 
rian twins to become two child-Hkci 
Ayorians, both shorter in stature 
with baby-like memory, but with 
improved capadty for solving prob- 
lems originally accepted by its par- 
ent. Thus, for thousands of gener- 
ations, the Ayorian magnetic form 
followed freely selected function, 
each twinning serving as a kind of 
radially-divergent evolutionary ef- 
fect. 

The Ayorian species itself had 
the analog to twinning. Periodically 
all Ayorian members combined cup 
to hemisphere of one another to 
form a long chain of Ayorians tied 
together by the characteristics of 
their magnetic structure. Then, 
speaking in unison, they made de- 
cisions which affected the whole 
species. These decisions, hopefully, 
permitted the spedes as a whole to 

IF 




progress up the ladder of evolution, 
too. It was such a decision that led 
to our slaying the Tepen — an evil, 
degenerate offshoot of the Ayor. 

I was first known as Spork, the 
moron, because of my childlike 
limitations of tdekmass. But once 
the Tepen were gone, caused prima- 
rily by change in the direction of 
Ayorian philosophical construct, I 
was fully accepted as an Ayorian 
adult though still called, not with- 
out some affection, Spork I 

I was twelve Enithra years old 
when the Tepen were destroyed; I 
worked five years more to advance 
the Ayorians in the direct use of 
their environment. 

Though sometimes suspecting 
that I would never twin as do other 
Ayorians, I accepted an additional 
twinning problem to advance the 
Ayor in their dual approach to 
life, my first being that accepted 
from Erne at her death, namely to 
find my purpose in life. 

Toward the end of learning more 
about direct action and its impli- 
cations in the real world, we con- 
served the Tepen citadel, the last 
remaining “city” of the Tepen 
which contained much of their 
knowledge and artifacts. 

Until I was forced to use my body 
and muscles in continuous motion, 
like all Enithra life, patterns of 
movement across the planet and 
their meanings could be discerned 
easily by application of my telek- 
mass faculties. 

SPORK AND THE BEAST 



I had first noticed how the Tepen, 
When moving across the valley floor, 
contrasted so strangely with their 
environment. Instead of teleporting 
from hummock to hummock as 
would the predatory Ettel, they 
seemed to flow, as though they were 
teleporting “continuously across an 
infinite set of points.” 

Of course, in walking or running, 
I, too, behaved like that; but it 
was not so easy to observe myself 
against the background of other 
Enithra life. 

U sing this concept as a starting 
point, I instructed the Ayor in 
concepts of direct manipulation of 
their environment; as I had once 
done for the Ayorian children, I 
used my own body to convey the 
message. I demonstrated how hands 
and arms could be used to lift, pull, 
bend and push things; I even dem- 
onstrated the novel way of drinking 
which I had discovered. Instead of 
teleporting water directly * to my 
mouth or stomach, I cupped my 
hands to hold the water, then bent 
to drink from my hands. 

Once these simpler concepts had 
been satisfactorily absorbed by the 
Ayors, I moved on to the develop- 
ment of tools from the environment 
around. For example, sticks could 
be used as levers, spears, dubs — 
each multiplying the weaker action 
of my muscles in some manner. 

They enthusiastically joined Ini 
the invention of these simpler tools 

t\ 




since, as past masters of abstract 
concept, they could easily compute 
anticipated effects from geometrical 
and physical energy considerations. 
Thus, they could often correctly 
predict the final outcome of a new 
and novel tool before its actual 
construction. 

As I saw it, my biggest job was 
to keep the Ayoris attention on the 
actual testing of their conjectures; 
for they had had thousands of 
years of heredity against which to 
fight, when only indirect twinning 
concepts were of importance and to 
this end I also applied myself 
diligently with some degree of 
success. 

Of course, always the children 
were most plastic. Indeed, without 
their plasticity there would have 
been no Ayorian race for they were 
the ones who had held my con- 
ceptual seeds enabling the Ayorian 
race to discover their racial obstacle 
during the time of grouping. Each 
child who successfully matured to 
reach adulthood eventually twinned 
to become two new children, each 
of whom were even more capable 
of comprehending and handling 
direct action without any loss of 
their indirect action faculties. 

I became the oldest untwinned 
Ayorian child, which was fortunate 
since there was indeed much to 
teach our one hundred thousand 
members! 

I was seventeen Enithra years old 
when the second ship came.

All life on Enithra plucks eternal- 
ly, within its sphere of capability, 
for nutrients. The tiniest life which 
I can sense with ray mass receptor 
reaches out with a telekmass field 
truly enormous for its small size; 
it teleports minerals, water and 
even tiny energy packets into its 
vacuoles. 

On up the scale of plant and 
animal life, each form takes dead 
or living matter in the same way, 
depending upon its nature. Thus, 
the beautiful violet and ultra-vio- 
let jungle growth spreads protective 
membranes over desired nourish- 
ment, struggling always against 
other life for its share of life re- 
quirements. 

T ie predatory Ettel teleports the 
fat, stupid Cien into its hug(B 
stomach sack; the Cien voraciously 
teleports all kinds of debris into its 
huge stomach. In the air, floating 
puff-balls reach out with frail fields 
hoping to catch dust motes or light- 
energy packets which, once caught, 
are teleported to interiors some- 
times in sufficient quantity to light 
like stars in the sky. While, in the 
many streams surrounded by our 
beautiful violet and ultra-violet veg- 
etation, all manner of Hfe extend 
mass-sensors in weird and complex 
patterns to sense, catch, and tele- 
port organic debris or five forms for 
food. 

It is easy to understand that one 
without telekmass faculties is at 

IF 




decided disadvantage on Enithra 
where even ultra-dense matter is as 
thin air to these faculties. 

AB Enithra life plucks at one an- 
other for food and only those who 
can generate stronger protective 
telekmass fields can survive the 
weaker. 

I was fortunate that Erne observed 
my lack so early, for, by com- 
pleting neuronic growths inside my 
body, she provided me with the 
means for self-protection on Enith- 
ra. 

Unfortunately, when the second 
ship arrived, none noticed for a 
time and telekmass mechanisms in 
all plant and animal life surround- 
ing the downed craft must have 
been instantaneously attracted to 
the rich, unprotected life ingredi- 
ents. Perhaps the landing area was 
poor in needed minerals for the 
first to go were minerals from the 
human bodies inside the craft! 

One of the children playing the 
nut tree game stumbled on the 
craft first. Ouble — the one who 
made the discovery — tdeported 
from the sunny side of the planet 
to teH me of his discovery. 

Thunder and lightning were shak- 
ing the sky and all around me the 
rain spattered against my slightly 
extended telekinetic field, while at 
every side plants Were struggling 
against one another to capture the 
finely dissolved nutrients accom- 
panying the rain drops. 

Ouble appeared before me, creat- 
SPORK AND THE BEAST 



ing another shell of spattering rain, 
to state in his quiet way, “A sec- 
ond ship has cradled. We think you 
should be there.” 

t my request, several Ayorians 
moved me to the site immedi- 
ately. Though I could have made 
the trip, forty miles per jump was 
more time-consuming than the sit- 
uation seemed to call for. 

It takes somewhat longer to de- 
scribe my impressions than I would 
like. In nearly simultaneous order, 
I sensed the pitted metal caused 
primarily by surrounding plant life, 
the two shallow graves filled with 
rapidly disappearing bodies, and 
the extremely weakened human be- 
ing who was slowly, methodically 
shoveling dirt into the graves. Then 
it was that the fantastic thought 
occurred to me in almost blinding 
boldness, “Could it be that this 
other, who is so much like me, 
knows nothing of Indirect action?” 

With my light receptors I could 
see the human utilize direct action 
only, to dig dirt and move it, to 
breathe, to perceive and to move 
his body. Although I did the same 
in varying combinations at various 
times, this human was not even pro- 
tected from Enithra plant and 
animal life around us, which prob- 
ably was the reason for his weak- 
ened condition! 

Pitting of the ship and the dead 
humans in the grave below was al- 
so caused by the same source — 

73 





nothing had protection from our 
ever-seeking life! 

Once I had extended my personal 
protective field around the ailing 
human and his ship, I spoke to one 
of the children. “Go to the Tepen 
"citadel for one of their telekmass 
protectors.” 

By the time the human had 
Jraised his head to take notice of my 
ffcudden presence, the child was back 
pgrith the device and I ignored the 
fjrisitor until the protective field 
held the whole area safe. 

1 Turning back to him I thought, 
“How strange is his appearance!” 

Though I had often looked at my 
own darkened features in smooth 
water and smooth metal mirrors, 
my standard of beauty was the sym- 
metrical shape of the Ayorian. 

Until now I hadn’t realized how 
truly ugly I must be. 

From the body portion, two arms 
hung loosely to lean on the shovel 
while his legs shivered with sick- 
ness and fatigue. I extended my 
mass sensors to take note of how 
calcium had been pitted from his 
bones. His head was thatched with 
yellow, tallow-like hair, as was 
mine; his light receptors were deep 
violet, as were mine; but his facial 
features were rounded where mine 
were lean and craggy. 

Now his light receptors opened 
wide with astonishment at my pres- 
ence. I thought nothing of it at the 
time, but it wasn’t my sudden, 
naked appearance from out of the 
74 



dense jungle which had surprised 
him so — it was my floating about 
two feet off the ground! 

When I telekmassed dirt into the 
shallow graves to complete his 
difficult labors I was rewarded with 
even more peculiar, uninterpretable 
expressions over his face. 

Though I was Spork, the Ayorian 
moron, I was not so dumb as to 
think this person would know either 
Ayorian or the dead Tepen lan- 
guage, though I tried both. 

I thought long and hard, then 
remembering my six-month-old re- 
call experience from my early child- 
hood, I mimicked my dead father’s 
voice to say: “Though we headed 
the house of the galactic council, 
Patricia, the sabotage was inevit- 
able. We may be genetically supe- 
rior, but to the common people we 
are still only human. Place the baby 
in the life container now! ” 

Our visitor fainted! 

n 

I telekmassed his body inside 
the ship to a strange platform 
covered with rectangular square 
patterns of imitation fibers and 
knitted with springy materials be- 
neath; then, I let my sensors pass 
through his body, comparing bis 
chemistry to mine. 

Calcium and phosphorus were 
seriously lacking as well as certain 
complex proteins. I reached info 
the surrounding forest to recover 

IF 




calcium from various soft mushy 
growths — probably the same ones 
Which caused his depletion — and 
replaced the calcium. The phospho- 
rus was retrieved from puff-balls 
in the air surrounding the ship. 

When I checked his blood 
against mine, I noted certain chem- 
icals which performed similar func- 
tions to some of mine, yet had 
minor structural and quantitative 
differences. Just as the Ayor, upon 
twinning have different personal 
magnetic structures due to differ- 
ences in alignment of their magnetic 
fields, humans too had normal dif- 
ferences. 

“Better not change those 1” I 
thought. 

Otherwise, his blood was sadly 
lacking in iron; any of the jungle 
trees around us would reach for such 
a rich supply. I reached deep into 
the soil of Enithra to tdeport mole- 
cules of iron, sulphur and oxygen. 
I mixed these minerals with water 
and placed them inside his stomach 
where I was gratified to sense Its 
rapid absorption for manufacture 
of red-blood platelets. 

When the limits of my knowledge 
had been reached andj I dared 
not go further, he woke. 

Only for a moment did his light 
receptors look at me; then he closed 
them again to deep for many days. 
I filled his stomach with nourish- 
ment and took care of his biologi- 
cal needs during his period of re- 
covery. Only once, when bis heart 
SPORK AND THE BEAST 



faltered, and I moved it in proper 
rhythm telekinetically, did I fear 
for his life. Afterward he gained 
health rapidly. 

As once before yvith the Tepen, 
my struggle for language began. As 
With the Tepen, concrete nouns 
formed the easiest common referent, 
or so it seemed until I used the 
Ayorian children usually surround- 
ing us as a word referent. 

For days he had thought I Was 
pointing to the air around us, or 
to the ship, or fo something else, 
for he could not see the Ayorl He 
icould not see ultra-violet reflections 
at alll 

As We studied together, his 
strength returned and protein de- 
ficiencies were rapidly eliminated. 

L ooking back upon the experi- 
ence, I now realize how I 
must have stared to see him chew 
gnd swallow every bit of food. 
Even to this day I find it a 
most fascinating phenomenon! The 
tongue and mouth are properly used 
for taste and talk. To use them, 
always, for swallowing is nearly be- 
yond comprehension! 

Other things, such as the clothes 
over his body, were odd, too — 'Stiff 
collar and decoration, stiffly pressed 
blue pants, bright red shirt, buckles, 
shoes and even smaller clothes un- 
derneath next to his skin. As odd 
as all these things Were, none could 
{compare with his complete inability 
to mass-sense or fo teleport. “If the 
75 




Ayor call me a moron because of 
my limitations with these faculties, 
what should we call our visitor?” 
I wondered. 

Months of language training from 
Toby Randolph — our visitor’s 
name — enabled us to carry con- 
versations beyond concrete nouns 
to somewhat higher levels of ab- 
straction. Again I mimicked my 
father’s phrase as I remembered it; 
he listened most carefully, but could 
not identify it. 

Toby Randolph belonged to a far 
distant planet many parsecs distant 
and he belonged to the household 
of the two humans buried outside 
the ship. Though it was many 
months before I learned the mean- 
ing of his rdationship to them, he 
described himself as a kind of “in- 
dentured slave-scientist” of their 
household. 

Mathematics, physics, chemistry 
and biology were exceptionally easy 
languages for me to understand. 
They were quite precise in them- 
selves; but more than this, I could 
extend my mass-sensor at least to 
the chemical level whenever firmer 
mental referents were required; 
physics and mathematics were quite 
similar to Ayorian philosophical 
games upon which I had already 
spent endless childhood hours. 

Most difficult for me to under- 
stand were concepts such as mon- 
ey, art, stores, schools, culture and 
so on. No Ayorian equivalents could 
possibly be construed to represent 
SPORK AND THE BEAST 



the concept of ownership, for ex- 
ample. 

In his turn, he constantly ex- 
claimed over how rapidly I could 
learn such abstract and complex 
concepts. To the Ayor I was Spork, 
the moron ; to Toby I was Spork, 
the savage. I wondered if everyone 
knew what I was except me! 

The most fantastic concept of all, 
however, was Toby’s description of 
civilization. When the concept of 
continuous motion as opposed to 
discrete teleportation was so new 
to me and other Ayorians, how could 
we be expected easily to under- 
stand and mentally grasp images of 
billions of people moving continu- 
ously with time, not to mention 
plant seeds, animals and even sea 
creatures? 

And what of the social organi- 
zation behind such concepts? The 
nearest comparison here on Enithra 
were the now-dead Tepen who, 
though offshoots, were still from 
Ayorian stock! 

I vowed then to find some way 
of visiting these strange lands to 
see and experience for myself! 

TTTith the aid of adult Ayorians, 
* * Toby’s ship was brought back 
to our captured Tepen citadel where 
its vast scientific resources could 
be better studied. Toby Randolph 
proved to be an invaluable asset 
in the Ayorian struggle to learn the 
tools and concepts which accompany 
direct faculties. He hdped the 

77 




Ayor, too, while I learned. These, 
being many times quicker intellect- 
ually than I, had long ago passed 
the mechanical leverage stage of 
toe# use. With the arrival of Toby, 
their capabilities increased in geo- 
metric progression. 

And twinning, too, increased geo- 
metrically. So many had twinned 
that only few remembered me as 
Spork, the child; though none would 
probably ever forget me as Spork, 
the moron. 

We learned to read. My light re- 
ceptors could move back and forth 
across a certain span of printed 
characters just so fast. My telek- 
mass sensor was quicker, leading 
Toby Randolph to believe that I 
had capabilities of eye span far 
greater than norioaally possible. 

But I refused to learn writing 
with my fingers. Why should I spend 
valuable time moving a tracing in- 
strument when, merely by mental- 
ly visualizing the complete set of 
symbols I wished to transcribe, I 
could instantaneously place corre- 
sponding marks on the page? After 
all, only a very tiny number of 
molecules on the page need be 
changed to effect a desired change 
in light transmission or reflection 
properties! 

The years passed and overhead 
in the clear sky above the lush 
tangle of Enfthra growths, the 
Ayorians again formed their group- 
ing chain. This day, instead of hid- 
ing like skulking animals deep with- 



in the bowels of Enithra’s crust, the 
Ayor pridefully joined cup to hemi- 
sphere better than two hundred and 
fifty thousand strong, each jockey- 
ing for proper polarity position, all 
contributing their bodies and ex- 
periences in a long curving line 
crossing the sky from horizon to 
horizon. 

Even Toby Randolph’s company, 
with his special glasses enabling him 
to see the chain of ultra-violet 
bodies overhead, couldn’t dispel my 
normal grouping gloom. Wasn’t I 
an Ayor, too? Must I forever be 
left out of the grouping chain? 

Normally the grouping lasted 
several weeks. This time, each in- 
dividual Ayorian was so well aligned 
with the Ayorian racial goals that 
only days were spent. 

When they broke, we were in- 
formed of their racial decision to 
penetrate even deeper the principles 
of direct action and associated 
scientific knowledge — they expected 
to be able to duplicate Toby Ran- 
dolph’s spacecraft 

Toby was astounded and delight- 
ed for in him must have been 
stimulated new visions of return to 
his civilization after all hope had 
gone. 

I knew there was something more 
behind the Ayorian decision, how- 
ever, for once the Ayor had accept- 
ed the principle of dual action, 
they fully realized their evolution- 
ary progress lay in facing and sur- 
mounting ever-larger challenges. 



78 



IF 




*Tphu& the ship was to be recon- 
1 structed; Toby was to have 
his trip home; I would satisfy my 
curiosity regarding civilization — 
but far more important, the Ayor 
'would accept new revolutionary 
challenges! 

Were we Ayorians to be limited 
by only direct action faculties, as 
were the humans of Randolph’s 
home planet, we too would need a 
(complex civilization where special- 
ists built the tools to build the tools 
to build the tools — perhaps to ten 
or twelve generations. 

On the other hand, given the 
model to go by — his pitted ship 
— as well as the new wealth of 
information supplied to us, by 
principles of indirect action alone 
we could have reconstructed his 
Ship. The process of reaching 
throughout the whole planet of 
Enirtha for appropriate elements* 
selecting them to properly prepared 
states of purify, and forming them 
With telekinetic energy to useful 
shapes was no more difficult than 
the normal Ayorian child’s game 
of hide-and-seek. 

But the adult Ayorian, though he 
could teleport himself about ten 
planetary diameters outward, would 
stOl have need for a ship when 
traveling across system or over 
galactic-wide distances, as well as 
need for direct action knowledge! 
similar to the other intelligent be- 
ings most likely to be encountered 
in the universe. 

SPORK AND THE BEAST 



Lack of complete linkag e in the 
echelon of tools plus the more 
natural faculties of indirect action 
led us to compromise. When it was 
possible to visualize the tool re- 
quired to make the desired item, 
we made the tool first, then did 
What was necessary to use it in 
making the desired item. 

If we could not make the tool 
because of our insufficiency of 
knowledge, we used indirect action 
|o make the item itself. 

[Toby Randolph’s first response 
to the Ayorian ship-building de- 
tisian was emotional in character; 
sober reflection on his part con- 
vinced him of its impossibility. "The 
drive,” he said, "is essentially a 
one-hundred-per cent mass to energy 
(converter. Its action chamber must 
be surrounded by a field of polari- 
zation which can only be formed by 
collapsing energy layers to form 
yery dense materials. 

"This process,” he continued, 
"can only be accomplished by ma- 
nipulation of exceedingly strong 
electro-gravitic fields far beyond 
Ayorian capacity to build or con- 
trol.” 

T he day was hot and humid, so 
all plant and animal life was 
at peak activity. Now, of course, 
I realize that such temperature and 
humidity changes often adversely 
iaffect the non-telekmass human, 
causing short temper and illogical 
reasoning. Perhaps that was Toby 

79 




Randolph’s chief difficulty at the 
time. Then, too, I suppose I should 
have explained the Ayorian ability, 
other than mine, to reach below 
the molecular threshold with tele- 
kinetic energy. As it was, I assigned 
the problem to Ayorian children 
who, now knowing one of the uses 
to which the chamber of dense met- 
al within which I was found after 
the crash of my parent’s ship and 
which is always associated with a 
polarization barrier, re-shaped the 
chamber to Toby’s demanding 
specifications. 

Our visitor became quite emotion- 
al oyer the incident. “You we in 
contact with a superior civilization 1 
You are lying to me!” 

Only when the children created 
more of the dense metal would he 
believe; and, for the first time, it 
seemed he was now willing to accept 
my prior discussions of direct 
versus indirect faculties at their face 
value. 

We developed a small mechanical- 
ly generated telekmass field for 
Tony’s self-protection so that he 
could journey safely away from the 
citadel. On every trip he would ac- 
claim to me, “The colors are wrong. 
They should be green! There is no 
pattern, no continuity to the be- 
havior of things! Seeds ripen, ma- 
ture, and spring away too rapdily!” 

“When nourishment is available 
within the sphere of the flower’s 
telekmass action in sufficient 
quantity to construct the seed, why 
80 



should it wait for days?” I asked. 

Though trained in the arts of 
objectivity, he retained his basically 
emotional nature, it seemed. 

When I turned from the subject 
of Enithra flowers to the small 
Eman, an animal which is equally 
at home in water or on the land, he 
showed similar exasperation. The 
Eman had virtually no intelligence; 
its chief survival characteristic lay 
in its ability always to anticipate 
the teleported flight of certain seeds. 
When the seed arrived, the Eman 
found its sphere of influence weH 
within the range of the newly de- 
posited seed. From there it was but 
a moment until the seed lay inside 
the Eman’s stomach. 

“But there just can’t be any way 
to knowl” Toby insisted. 

“Sometimes,” I thought, “he is 
as stubborn in his way as the Ayor 
used to be in their wayl” 

Until the decision to build the 
ship, little attention had been placed 
on our planetary system or the stars 
beyond. Our planet Enithra has no 
moon. Although adult Ayorians 
could teleport 250,000 miles out- 
ward, air had to be teleported along 
with them. Only energy fields, 
stripped atoms and some few whole 
molecules, thinly scattered, were to 
be found there. 

Though lacking in light receptors, 
their ability to mass-sense below 
the molecular level gave them fine 
reception of energy groupings scat- 
tered throughout their sky, resulting 

IF 




in better knowledge of the stars and 
other energy sources than narrow 
range of visible light frequency 
alone might have done. 

I grew up with the knowledge 
that our planetary system consisted 
of five planets surrounding a huge 
sun in elliptical orbits. We were the 
fourth planet from the sun and 
before visiting other worlds, such 
as the one represented by our visit- 
or, we wished to know our own 
planetary system better. 

*nphe finished ship was a perfect 
duplicate of Tony Randolph’s — 
dim, long-tapered with severe geo- 
metric lines from head to tail, 
clusters of matter conversion cham- 
bers surrounding its tail and termin- 
ated with stacked propulsion units 
and other interesting, unusual-to- 
Enithra features. 

“Later,” I thought, “we Ayorians 
will create original forms!” 

Dingon, one of the Ayorians who 
had nearly reached his twinning 
period with the finish of the ship, 
was selected for our first trial run, 
though Toby Randolph protested 
that he should go. But the decision 
was to include only one human and 
one Ayor. 

The ship raised easily; we adjust- 
ed the molecules of our body to 
compensate for the pull of acceler- 
ation as the ship swept upward with 
ever-increasing velocity. 

What a unique experience it was 
for Dingon and me! Near us, we 

SPORK AND THE BEAST 



sensed the craft’s solid state switch- 
ing and other slight vibrations in 
the instrument board, the smooth 
flow of the air-exchanger and much 
other internal phenomenon. While 
far away, decreasing density of air 
molecules, made up of lighter and 
lighter fractions, swept past us. 

The biggest change was the sud- 
den silence. I don’t mean the aud- 
ible kind of silences; I mean the 
lack of Enithra’s plucking telekine- 
tic fingers. For aU of Dingon’s life, 
he had been exposed to the back- 
ground of ever-seeking plant and 
animal life; and for eight of Eni- 
thra years, I had subconsciously 
countered these same probing fin- 
gers; but beyond the planet’s at- 
mosphere, at seventy miles, the 
planet’s fingers decreased to noth- 
ing. 

I can only say the silence was 
fantastic. I could extend my mass 
sensitivity nearly double my usual 
forty miles; Dingon could increase 
his to nearly half a million. Over 
half of our telekmass capacity had 
been unconsciously used to count- 
eract Enithra life in our own self- 
protection! 

I had half-way believed Toby 
Randolph when he said we were 
unique — the only planet to use and 
develop indirect faculties. Planet 
five was a certain refutation of his 
statement. 

Unlike Enithra, [Janet five was 
colder and its vegetation was not so 
profuse; also unlike Enithra, it had 

81 





i 




huge ice caps at both of its poles. 
But like Enithra, all of its primitive 
life forms followed the indirect ac- 
tion principle. 

TX7e landed in its warmest zone, 
* * near the equator. I sent my 
mass sensor up the steep cliff lying 
before our grounded craft and at 
the very top, lacking moisture and 
warmth as well as oxygen, were very 
primitive organisms. 

Their feeble search through the 
rocks for water, oxygen and miner- 
als could be easily sensed. When 
they encountered minerals contain- 
ing needed chemicals, they separ- 
ated the molecule from its binding 
force and the rocks slowly but 
surely succumbed to the demands 
i of new life. 

As my mass-sensor followed down 
the high mountain side there were 
encountered ever-increasingly com- 
plex patterns of life. Throughout 
most of the planet, oxygen was 
mixed with combinations of nitro- 
gen and hydrogen; the plant growths 
reflected the differences of both 
energy and atmosphere. 

“Someday,” I thought, “life will 
become intelligent even here!” 

We scouted around the planet. 
With his great telekmass range, 
Dingon now knew it intimately, of 
course. 

Across the narrow, warm band 
which represented^ planet five’s 
equator, was a form of life related 
to us. Where the Ayorian was 



shaped like a figure eight, his prim- 
itive counterpart on this planet was 
like two eights laid one over the 
other at right angles — like Toby’s 
description of a four-leaf clover. 

“Finding the true relationship 
between life of both planets should 
one day provide the Ayorian with 
many twinning problems,” I thought. 

We pushed off from the fifth 
planet to explore the other three 
unknowns in our planetary system. 
Out in space, we were once again 
able to extend our mass sensors 
through approximately douSle their 
normal volume. Just for fun, Ding- 
on and I teleported outside the ship. 
W« took air with us and kept it 
under pressure. My light receptors 
could see the brilliant steady flow 
of our stars in every direction; it 
was so beautiful I How I wanted to 
explain its sight to Dingon! 

He, in his turn, wanted very much 
to explain the fine sensitivity of 
energy patterns which he could 
sense below my threshold level! 

We passed the orbit of Enithra 
and swung in toward where planet 
three would soon be. We were per- 
haps three or four million Mies 
away from Enithra’s orbit when 
Dingon’s far-probing mass sensor hit 
the telekinetic field. He knew im- 
mediately the nature of its strength. 
“Turn back — quickly! ” he shouted 
with panic in his thoughts. 

I flicked the switches with my 
mind rapidly heeding his cry; but 
as fast as I was, the new telekinetic

field was faster. Long, thin, sen- 
sitive strands of telekinetic energy 
had been laid well beyond the or- 
bit of the third planet. These 
strands, not unlike the mechanical 
traps of the dead Tepen, were set 
only to sense usable chemicals. 
When such was encountered, the 
full force of gome gigantic being 
impressed its will in that direction 
to grasp fully and teleport its prey. 

The field slugged us like some 
gigantic gravitational weS. 

m 

IXTe struggled against the huge 
* * field with every molecule of 
our beings. We could not carry our- 
selves and the ship, which was pro- 
tected with its own mechanically 
generated field, against that all- 
demanding force. Dingon teleported 
us both to his now-shortened two 
hundred-thousand mile range, well 
beyond the reaoh of the bestial 
field. 

With only small amounts of air 
held telekinetically tight around us, 
we now had some five to six million 
miles of nearly empty space be- 
tween us and Enithra. 

When I become moody, or other- 
wise emotional — a state foreign to 
the biological Ayorians — I tend to 
escape my troubles by letting my 
thinking processes dwell on Enithra 
and its beloved ecology. Loneliness 
in space and near death brought 
no exceptions to the rule. 

SPORK AND THE BEAST 



On Enithra there exists a tough 
mammal, which we call the Fervra, 
addicted to a world-swinging no- 
madic existence. Though there are 
few desert s and all of small con- 
sequence, the Fervra passes direct- 
ly through these climatic zones with- 
out regard to consequences, unlike 
other mammals of equally short 
telekmass range. Whenever food be- 
comes sparse, the Fervra teleports 
fats from its own body to its stom- 
ach sack, thus living on itself dur- 
ing famine periods. 

My mind now dwelled on the in- 
teresting habits of the Fervra as I 
let my body swing around and 
around, watching the stars circle 
about me. It was then the insight 
which saved our lives penetrated my 
conscious thought! 

“Will fat and protein from my 
larger body supply Dingon while 
he teleports us?” I wondered. 

I reached into the fat layers of 
my body and teleported thin layers 
into Dingon’s stomach. Quickly 
realizing my purpose, he molded 
the ingredients to suit his own needs, 
then caused us to jump nearly 
half way home before all of my body 
fat was gone. 

I reached into my body again, 
taking liberally of my blood and 
this brought us nearly home. Now 
in weakened state, I reached feebly 
into the long stranded fibers of my 
big muscles selecting every hun- 
dredth strand. I remember no more, 
for I lost consciousness then! 



85 




Even with Ayorian assistance, 
many months passed while my body 
mended. Not yet could the Ayorian 
mind repair the life cell itsdf and 
I had dangerously exhausted many 
of the organs of my body when 
supplying Dingon with the materi- 
als from which he could gain the 
tremendous energies needed to tele- 
port us through millions of miles 
of space. 

'T'he next time of grouping came 
and we puzzled over this ap- 
parently new form of life — so tre- 
mendously powerful, it could reach 
across millions of miles of space to 
grasp mass the size of our rocket. 

On this portion of Enithra, on 
this particular day, the weather was 
cool and the wind blew gently 
across the rapidly shifting plant 
forms. Toby Randolph, now dressed 
in what he called workclothes, sat 
near the grouping area, looking 
somewhat bug-eyed because of his 
ultra-violet glasses. 

High overhead in an arc as long 
as the horizon, weaving in several 
S-shaped curves across the sky, were 
the Ayor, clasping one another with 
cup to hemisphere. 

With my pitifully weak magnetic 
field attached to single cells in un- 
coordinated array, even I could 
feel the mighty pulsing of their 
joint field as permutations and com- 
binations of individual Ayorian ex- 
periences moved swiftly hack and 
forth along the chain. " 

86 



“What are they doing this time?” 
JToby asked. “Fve seen them like 
this before, but I still don’t be- 
lieve it.” 

I knew his comments were merely 
rhetorical, for I had explained the 
grouping phenomenon many times 
before. 

“Listen, TobyT Soon their ex- 
periences will be completely shared 
and they will begin to question and 
make decisions.” 

Booming like Enithra thunder as 
It rolls between peaks of broadly 
u-shaped valleys, their joint com- 
ments began: 

“Can Spork and Dingon elabor- 
ate on the giant telekinetic field of 
their trip?” 

Dingon passed bis personal ex- 
periences in detail along the chain 
and I confirmed his comments by 
verbal response, not having near 
the detail available to Dingon. 

“Would that giant field be a me- 
chanically generated one created by 
the evil Tepen or organisms like 
the evil Tepen?” they asked in uni- 
son. 

Dingon’s experience replied, but 
they still answered together: “No! 
The quality was different It was 
an organically generated field.” 

“How far does the field extend 
Into space?” 

“Unknown.” 

“What are its limitations?” 

“Unknown.” 

“Can the joint power of our whole 
race handle the fiddE’* 

IF 




“No I” was the joint reply. 

“Where is the beast located?” 

“Unknown.” 

“What are the beast’s character- 
istics?” 

“It is primitive; it is grasping, 
voraciously, blindly in hunger; it 
needs materials of all kinds — metals 
protoplasms, chemicals and so forth; 
it is fantastically powerful — far 
more so than anything previously 
imagined by the Ayor.” 

The sun split its ultra-violet 
beams between Tepen towers when 
the Ayor grouping chain broke and 
I followed Toby Randolph into the 
Tepen chamber. \ 

nphe remainder of the year 
•** passed; I turned nineteen and 
the puzzle remained with us. Now 
the time of grouping was on us again 
and Toby was depressed again, 
having lost his chance, he thought, 
of returning home. 

Though I had probed both Toby 
Randolph’s and Ayorian memories 
mercilessly for some clue, we just 
didn’t have sufficient data upon 
which to build a decent conjecture. 
And, much like a year ago, Toby 
and I sat near Enithra’s surface, 
while overhead across the horizon, 
doubled and re-doubled, were the 
linked Ayorians. We waited. Then 
with some respect to my limitations, 
the group spoke in unison: “We 
must re-structure the Tepen field 
which once held nearly the whole 
of the Ayor in captivity. We con- 
SPORK AND THE BEAST 



ceive this new, mindless entity to 
be our new racial twinning prob- 
lem.” 

Imagine! Once I had to force the 
Ayor to face their immediate Tepen 
murderers. Now, an entity millions 
of miles away, far stronger than the 
Ayor, was pronounced to be their 
racial twinning problem! How fast 
my brethren grewl 

m 

T only hoped the problem would 
not prove too great for us! 

All knew that tdekmass faculties 
reached deeply beyond the spatial 
structure of ordinary material con- 
cepts to tap “triggers” which caused 
discrete jumps of objects from point 
to point. This was why we labeled 
our faculties as being indirect in- 
stead of direct. 

Our problem was not so much to 
learn the Tepen trick of artificial- 
ly inducing the field as to learn how 
to strengthen it 

Our nervous structure was capa- 
ble of assimilating large quantities 
of chemically formed energy which 
we used to open the door, so to 
speak, to reach through to the trig- 
gers. Once the triggers were 
reached, virtually zero energy was 
involved in the teleportation of 
mass or in the communication back 
to us on the state and structure of 
the mass. 

A precise scientific statement of 
the trigger phenomenon involves 

87 




the complexities of shrisltiiig space 
between points A and B by means 
of slowing all energies between the 
two points to some limiting factor 
— exactly the opposite from the 
phenomenon observed whenever we 
note the ultra-violet shift of a far off 
galaxy as the universe expands in 
toto. 

When all energy within a partic- 
ular sphere of influence has slowed 
sufficiently, space contracts and two 
points become contiguous, but only 
from particular points of view. 

We Ayorians, by means of in- 
direct faculties, could trigger the 
phenomenon in both directions. Our 
chief problem, then, was in opening 
the door, after which no energy at 
all was required to maintain its 
effect. 

On Enithra, the tiny one-celled 
life teleported nutrients as far as 
one hundred cellular diameters; 
yet, it could do nothing to resist 
the tiny water creatures which tele- 
ported the one-celled life to its own 
digestive system by the millions. 
The one-celled solution for survival 
was to increase its twinning rate, 
multiplying itself swiftly. 

Meanwhile the Yal, which fed on 
such one-celled life, could in no 
way resist the Ries; and, the Ries 
could not resist the voracious, 
stupid Cien who in turn could not 
resist the predatory Ettel. 

Nowhere in the ecological niche 
of Enithra life did one miss a thread 
leading always to the Ayor on top. 
88 



Now, in our own planetary sys- 
tem, it appeared that some unin- 
telligent entity was superior to the 
brilliant Ayor! 

nphe children discovered the first 
clue. When asked to create the 
dense material with its associated 
shield of polarization for Toby 
Randolph’s benefit, a new game had 
become traditional among the chil- 
dren. Whoever could create the 
densest material was declared its 
winner. 

On a certain day, Nltque lost 
track of his created mass. Piqued 
with curiosity, the children asked 
Nitque to repeat the phenomenon 
while they observed. Some thirty 
children were holding the tiny pin- 
point of dense material as it snapped 
out of its spatial orientation through 
a minute “hole”, but the children’s 
minds followed easily finding it 
among the telekinetic triggers. 

Mass, another form of energy, 
when condensed to its ultimate, 
stressed the fabric of space suffici- 
ently to open normal space to these 
telekinetic triggers, and, it seemed 
the more mass per unit of volume, 
the more stress; hence, the more 
trigger access and the more field 
power, but not in exactly a propor- 
tional relation. 

We stored the heaviest possible 
mass just short of the point of 
diminishing return in our next ship. 
By attaching the Tepen-type ma- 
chine to our spatial holes we hoped 

IF 




t# generate a truly strong telekinetic 
field capable of resisting the fan- 
tastic being of outer space. 

Nonetheless, when the time came, 
Dingon and I prepared nutrients to 
hang around our bodies should we 
have need of returning in the same 
awkward manner as before. 

The sun was just rising above the 
horizon as our new ship rose flaw- 
lessly as before. The trip, though 
of interest to such newcomers to 
space as we, held no new phenom- 
enon and we progressed well until 
Dingon’s half-million-mile range 
touched the beast at the fringes 
of the beast’s searching tendrils. 

It was then I felt the full power 
of the beast as he sprang toward us. 

Dingon pushed our prepared 
dense mass over its spatial thresh- 
old, the Tepen machinery caught, 
generating its strong telekinetic 
field and I thought: "Now we shaS 
see what happens when the irresist- 
able force meets the immovable 
object.” 

Unfortunately we were not exact- 
ly immovable! 

Stronger and stronger the beast’s 
field became, while our field stayed 
at constant strength. 

Hour after hour we crept through 
his field, never daring to relax. Near 
the orbit of the third planet, the 
beast’s intensity jumped even high- 
er in easily felt increments; it be- 
came apparent to both of us that 
our present equipment was not yet 
strong enough. 

SPORK AND THE BEAST 



I mentally snapped the controls, 
causing us to turn; the beast, per- 
haps instinctively sensing .our pur- 
pose, doubled and redoubled its 
efforts. 

T Tnder heavy attack from the 
^ beast, both Dingon and I felt 
we were participating in some gigan- 
tic squeezing game; though we 
added our own puny efforts to those 
of our machinery, the beast’s re- 
sources seemed endless. 

Slower our ship traveled, though 
its fuel converted to energy at 
maximum rate. Was this finally to 
be my end? I wondered if all our 
personal efforts, our life’s evolu- 
tionary purpose, was merely to 
provide chemical feed to an insati- 
able monster? If so, to what ulti- 
mate purpose? Was this to be the 
answer to my twinning problem: 
What is my true purpose in life? 

Jerking my mind from such 
thoughts, I asked Dingon to in- 
crease the rate at which fuel was 
being converted, hoping that the 
chamber could stand the strain. 

The ship shuddered, not end to 
end, or side to side, but molecule 
by molecule; and we could sense 
shudder. The conflicting telekin- 
etic fields caused the new phenom- 
enon. 

But the ship leaped forward suc- 
cessfully to leave the grasp of the 
beast behind and we felt great relief 
as we sensed the laist of his tendrils 
behind us. 



89 




Our sigh was premature for the 
struggle had had its effect on every 
atom under our control; part of the 
ship’s atoms had vibrated in one 
direction while adjacent atoms vi- 
brated in opposite directions. Weak- 
nesses developed, holes grew, ma- 
terials pitted; then the ship itself 
began to fall apart. 

With all our being, Dingon and 
I struggled to hold the ship togeth- 
er to no avail. Then it failed and 
we were out in space again, without 
ship. 

This time sufficiently braced with 
nutrients hanging around our bodies, 
we leisurely teleported pur way 
home. 

Our trip was not a total loss. We 
had penetrated much deeper, for 
one thing. And another phenomenon 
correlated in our minds: first was 
the case of Toby Randolph and his 
rapidly sickening "house masters.” 
At the time I had thought the val- 
ley of their landing lacked miner- 
als and other easy nutrients causing 
the valley’s life forms to leap on 
the ship as a new, easy source. Now 
I wondered if Toby’s ship had 
traveled within grazing distance of 
the monster I If so, just a fleeting 
touch could easily have explained 
the rapid depletion of vital pro- 
teins and minerals from both hu- 
mans and ship. 

Confirmation could be obtained 
from Toby and his ship’s comput- 
ers and their records. But what 
about my owti parents’ flight? Was 

90 



my very presence on Enithra caused 
by the beast and his action against 
my parents’ ship? 

We re-computed the relative 
positions of all planets as they had 
been two years ago as well as the 
position of Toby’s ship. He shad 
indeed grazed the fringes of the 
beast 

By simple deduction, this placed 
the monster beyond the third planet, 
further in toward the sun. Since 
nothing capable of being sensed lay 
between the orbits of the third and 
second planet, this raised an even 
more astounding conjecture; for 
if the monster Was on the second 
planet, it was capable of extending 
its telekmass sensor some 24,000,000 
miles in radius. We Ayorians, even 
as a complete grouping entity, were 
yet thousands of generations away 
from that kind of range and power! 

IV 

W e Ayorians had indeed select- 
ed a worthy racial twinning 
probleml 

The building of ships had almost 
become a kind of instinctive reflex 
— so much of that chemical in this 
quantity, structured just so; add 
a little of this; hold it in a certain 
way; weld the metal together tele- 
kinetically — and so the third ship 
was built. 

If was constructed similar to the 
second ship, only stronger and big- 
ger. Our whole intent this time was 

IF 




to learn about the beast’s limi- 
tations and exact location. If the 
beast were located on a planet, two 
possible means of its control were 
suggested. At our present state of 
technological development, every- 
one realized that any thought of 
killing the beast was pure fantasy. 

On our third trip, Dingon and I 
skirted the edge of the beast’s sen- 
sory tendrils. Dingon cast his half- 
million-mile sensory field outward 
until just barely grazing the beast’s, 
then signalled me to reverse direc- 
tion rapidly before the beast could 
launch an all out attack. 

From every direction we repeated 
the procedure until our spatial map 
was complete. 

Take a ball and place a hundred 
arrows around it pointing direct- 
ly toward the ball’s center. Now 
move the ball in an egg shaped or- 
bit around, say, a bright lamp. 
Keep in mind the locus of points 
of the arrows around the egg-shaped 
path representing successive time 
points. 

This spatial graph made it quite 
clear that the beast was located on 
planet two. 

Since the beast was bracketed 
between the first and third planet, 
at certain times of the year the 
beast was capable of reaching 
either planet, probably to strip 
them of their life and minerals un- 
til relative orbital positions changed. 
Our ship had reached inside the 
orbit of tiie third planet Based on 

92 



this knowledge, phis estimates of 
the beast’s strength, we planned 
ahead. 

The new ship was to be capable 
of landing on either the first or 
third planet without undue stress 
from the beast of planet two. It 
had to be huge, since the mass of 
the required dense metal used for 
triggering our enlarged telekinetic 
field required abnormal structural 
bracings. To avoid stripping our 
beautiful planet of Enithra for min- 
erals in the quantities needed for 
our new ship, most of the ship- 
building Ayor moved to the fifth 
planet. Within a matter of weeks, 
assembled in orbit and nearly 
twenty miles long, the engineering 
feat which would assist us in cap- 
turing the beast of planet two was 
finished. 

Nearly one thousand adult Ayor- 
ians were loaded aboard the new 
ship to assist in handling and tip- 
ping the dense mass which was to 
provide us with our extra-powerful 
protective fidd. Other Ayorians 
operated and sensed the special tele- 
kinetic control instruments which 
controlled the ship. 

Vf7e swung outward with pon- 
* * derous slowness entirdy un- 
like our earlier trips. We plodded 
onward until we swung around 
planet three at approximately 
seventy miles up, now just barely 
able to sense the beast’s frantic 
efforts to grasp us. Bdow us was 

IF 




the most fantastic sight; the planet 
had no gaseous envelope, no water, 
methane or ammonia. There were 
no features anywhere — nothing ex- 
eept a tiny rounded ball of radio- 
active materials — ingredients un- 
wanted by the beast of planet two. 

Planet one, too, proved to con- 
sist of beast-swept radioactive de- 
bris; and it now became clear why 
the beast extended itself into empty 
space so far in search of random 
debris to satisfy its hunger. Long 
ago, it had used every non-radio- 
active ingredient of both planets 
one and three! 

The return to Enithra was un- 
eventful, though filled with anti- 
cipation for our next stage of prep- 
arations. Our cumbersome ship was 
left high in orbit while we teleported 
to Enithra’s surface. 

I made my first jump from sixty 
miles up, then fell free for a few 
minutes, receiving such an exhilara- 
ting experience I vowed to repeat 
the game again during more peace- 
ful times. 

Down below me, shimmering 
across the hundreds of miles of 
planet, was the violet and ultra- 
violet valleys of Enithra. On one 
side of me was Enithra’s only large 
body of water; in front of me was 
the wandering river near our cap- 
tured citadel; and everywhere I 
could see as well as sense, were the 
shifting, jumping changes of animal 
and plant life I loved so well. It 
made me feel good. 

SPO$K AND THE BEAST 



Mathematical computations shew- 
ed the beast to be of planetary size. 

Apparently Hfe based upon the 
principles of indirect action was 
common to our whole planetary sys- 
tem since it was found on planets 
two, five and four. It was not un- 
reasonable to suppose that planets 
one, two and three had also de- 
veloped to our form of Kfe. 

During evolutionary branchings 
some mindless creature had become 
dominant on planet two, where its 
voracious appetite led it to consume 
not only all other Kfe but all except 
the most useless of demental ma- 
terials. 

As the being grew in size, tele- 
kinetic structures must have been 
formed internally to support its fan- 
tastic volume while internal indirect 
action sensory organs must have 
developed to form and speed nu- 
trients from one portion of its huge 
bulk to another once they arrived 
at each receptor site. 

TX7hen the mindless creature had 
* ’ consumed all nutrients on its 
own planet, or even before this hap- 
pened, it must have had sufficient 
telekinetic power to reach across 
space to its nearest neighbor, planet 
one, at certain times of the year. 
Then having voraciously swept 
planet one clean of aD useful ma- 
terials, it turned its blind insatiable 
appetite toward the more distant 
planet three. 

One could easily imagine how it 

93 




must have struggled time and again 
to reach the more distant planet, al- 
ways failing but, in its drive to 
live, always learning new means for 
focusing ami reinforcing its telekin- 
etic pseudopods. 

Then one day, at the proper time 
of year, a tip of its reaching fin- 
ger touched planet three’s surface, 
after which an avalanche of ma- 
terials followed back into its hol- 
lowed belly until finally even planet 
three was swept dean of all but the 
most unusable radio-active debris. 

What then? Planet four — En- 
ithra, of course! 

But Enithra was so far distant 
from planet two that hundreds of 
thousands of years must pass while 
the beast learned to sweep space 
for atom-sized debris garnished oc- 
casionally by meteorite or chance 
space-ship, collecting only enough 
nourishment to maintain life; never 
enough to pick the Enithra plum 
beyond. 

The radio-active debris unwanted 
by the beast, though small, proved 
sufficiently dense to provide the 
base upon which our telekmass pro- 
tective screens could be assembled. 
The dense mass which would provide 
us with the required power, once 
pushed through normal space, had 
been scooped from the bowels of 
our own planet five. 

The residue of planets one and 
three followed orbits which some- 
times caused one or the other to be 
far beyond the beast’s range. But 

94 



always, at least one of the covering 
fields surrounded the beast and 
sometimes both. 

Once the beast was successfully 
caged, we landed on its leathery 
surface with impunity. Unlike any- 
thing ever before imagined by us. 
Ayor, the beast was perfectly 
spherical and of nearly three times 
the volume of Enithra. 

Ayorian faculties were necessar- 
ily limited to the beast’s surface. 
Had we been so foolhardy as to 
probe our protective field, the beast, 
from his own interior, would cer- 
tainly be instantly in command. 
Speculations on novel internal telek- 
mass faculties continued to explain 
both the unnatural size and per- 
fect sphericity of the beast. 

TT ad we really captured the beast? 
“ Was it fastened there now — 
would it solve its new evolutionary 
challenge within a short time, to 
rise again in renewed wrath and 
energy? 

What could such tiny energy 
units as we Ayorians actually do to 
something as gigantic and ancient 
as this beast? We were incapable 
of killing it, yet we had the auda- 
city to announce its successful cap- 
ture! 

How long before chance events 
tore our trap apart? A particularly 
heavy meteor of just the right vec- 
tor could easily tear through our 
feeble physical object barrier sur- 
rounding our telekmass generators 

IF 




on either of the planets one or three. 
What then? Would the beast find 
sufficient intelligence and means 
somehow to destroy us after all? 

Who knew what the beast was 
really capable of doing? When I 
could not understand all the work- 
ings of the tiny Ayorians whose 
bodies were only half as tall as 
mine and half as wide, could I, or 
any other Ayorian truly expect 
to know the inner workings of a 
beast three times the volume of our 
whole planet? 

I felt uneasy about our solution 
but recognized it as the best that 
could be done at our stage of tech- 
nical development. 

“Someday,” I thought, “we Ayor- 
ians must learn how to destroy this 
beast. What skill and technology 
Is ours is not yet capable of its sure 
(destruction! ” 

*T*oby Randolph found our beau- 
tiful violet and ultra-violet 
jungle with its myriads of tele- 
porting insects and animal life, de- 
pressing in spirit. He was therefore 
delighted with my decision to re- 
turn with him to civilization. 

Our first Ayorian problem became 
evident when I gave Arl, one of the 
twinned children of my former 
partner Dingon, permission to ac- 
company us. Always before, for 
thousands of generations back, we 
Ayors had been restricted to one 
planet and each year aU Ayor ex- 
cept me joined in the grouping. 
SPORK AND THE BEAST 



If I were to remove one of the 
grouping Ayors, would the race lose 
some of its evolutionary impetus? 
Further, would Arl himself still be 
capable of personal twinning ad- 
vancement when no longer flee to 
join the annual grouping? 

Many weeks ware spent contem- 
plating these questions while Toby 
fretted and fussed in his anxiety 
to return home. 

I was now slightly over nineteen 
Enithra years old and anxious to 
continue with my own twinning 
problem which I had taken from 
Erne: What was my purpose hi life 
and who was I? Yet, I couldn’t 
press my own twinning with pos- 
sible sacrifice to either Arl or my 
whole race. 

Unwilling to cause even the slight- 
est damage to any of my brothers 
and while deep in thought, I wan- 
dered out of the dtadel to the cool 
of the beautiful forest surrounding 
us. My mind relaxed while my body, 
using its muscles in direct action, 
moved continuously from point to 
point along the cool, mossy floor. 

At my feet I could perceive the 
mass-sensing tendrils of the jungle 
moss reaching below the ground, 
jerkily searching for mineral, water 
and oxygen. 

Some nutrients were easily tele- 
ported to proper portions of the tiny 
plant while the sweet odors of its 
flowers changed texture from mo- 
ment to moment and its seeds grew 
to mature and burst forth in hew 



95 




seed of teleported flight, landing, 
hopefully, in rich soil to begin the 
cycle anew. 

Here and there I sensed the small 
mindless insect, called the let, 
which, like the Eman, placed itself 
exactly near the expected arrival 
point of maturing seed to wait for 
its -appearance; then reaching out 
with its own tiny mass sensor, R 
quickly teleported portions of the 
newly created seed to its stomach. 

As I physically walked through 
the telekinetic plucking of other 
life forms I wondered: “Since each 
ecological niche has been filled on 
Enithra, and we Ayor are the high- 
est, why are we afraid to separate 
from the group? Even the tiny seeds 
of the moss at my feet spread out- 
ward in new and different direc- 
tions seeking the opportunity to 
spread its kind in new places. 
What is so unique about the Ayor 
as to cause such strong need for 
grouping each Enithra cycle?” 

As my body continued to prac- 
tice direct action motion, my 
mind roamed from jungle object to 
abstract thought in relaxed, random 
order. I let my mind soak in the 
whole of the jungle surrounding me 
to the very limit of my forty-mile 
radius. I could sense Ayorian chil- 
dren at play in one direction while 
in another I could watch the pre- 
datory Ettel teleport from spot to 
spot to come within range of its 
custdmary dinner. 

9* 



On my right, perhaps a half a 
mile away, was a whitish puffstick 
growth rare to this part 6f the 
jungle. In some little state of curi- 
osity, I focused my attention on its 
slow growth. Its customary nour- 
ishment was oxygen, nitrogen, car- 
bon, and water from the air. I 
sensed it reaching for these ingredi- 
ents; then, as it teleported each to 
itself, it quickly reassembled the 
molecules in complex patterns to 
farm new parts of itself. As I walked 
and observed, the puffstick grew 
ever-larger but at a rate much slow- 
er than most other Enithra plant 
growth. When it became as big as 
my head, it teleported all parts of 
itself; some of the fragments passed 
completely out of my forty-mile 
sensing range. It had a truly re- 
markable range when compared to 
its other weaker capabilities! 

The portions landing within my 
sensing field began to grow as had 
its parent, except for those which 
found themselves providing nour- 
ishment for other insects and strong- 
er plants. 

Then it was that the puffstick 
activity triggered my next 
thoughts: “How will the Ayor suc- 
cessfully advance in their group 
twinning cycle if they are to be 
limited to the size of one grouping? 
Since they place their bodies one 
to the other, forming a long chain 
consisting of all the Ayor, event- 
ually their population will number 
so many that the time involved in 

IF 




sharing each experience in every 
permutation will take longer than 
the total time period between group- 
ing cycles I” 

Tj'or generations the Ayor had 
* numbered no more than one 
hundred thousand; when the Tepen 
were defeated, the Ayor grew swift- 
ly in number. Not only were they 
no longer preyed upon by Tepen, 
but individuals were twinning more 
rapidly as they individually under- 
took new challenges of direct action 
principles; now, they numbered bet- 
ter than 400,000. 

I knew my reasoning must bn 
correct; but could I convince the 
Ayor? Next grouping was nearly 
a year away, and this was so long 
to wait in pursuit of my twinning 
problem! 

Also, why did the Ayor meet only 
once each year? CotdJ they success- 
fully group whenever desired in- 
stead of periodically? 

My musings continued into the 
dusk; my thoughts stirred endless- 
ly throughout the night. In the 
morning I hesitatingly and in 
stumbling manner posed these bask 
questions to my brethren. They re- 
sponded by tests and found they 



could group at will; and while an- 
other long cherished Ayorian tra- 
dition fell, from high overhead in 
the cod of the evening, their new- 
est grouping nearly hid all of the 
stars as they jointly reviewed my 
newest point of philosophy far into 
the next day. 

Their group decision emphatical- 
ly favored distribution and disper- 
sion of separate Ayorian nuclei as 
far and as wide as possible through- 
out the stars. 

I was greatly pleased, for now we 
Ayorians would survive and grow 
in many new and successful pat- 
terns! 

Tnstfead of just Ari, then, I took 
-*• nearly one hundred thousand of 
my brethren. We built a new, 
larger ship, then took our leave from 
Enithra. 

Now free of the dangerous prob- 
ing tentacles of the beast of planet 
two, we directed our course through 
the center of our system toward the 
star Quations, the home star of Toby 
Randolph. He, of course, was might- 
ily pleased; yet I wondered if his 
unnaturally quiet ways and in- 
creased anxiety didn’t forecast dif- 
ficulties for him ahead. END

TXTe traveled uneventfully past 
* * the orbit of the fifth planet 
before I tripped the so-called hyper- 
spatial drive. To Toby Randolph 
the phenomenon was one of silence, 
motionless and lightlessness. To us 
Ayorians, the sensation was inter- 
esting, stimulating, surprising and 
otherwise opposite from Toby’s ex- 
periences. 

Once free of Eaithra’s eternally 
plucking telekmass fingers, our in- 
direct faculties doubled, mine to 
eighty miles while others reached 
their nearly-haU-million-mile lim- 
its. 

We held our senses outward 
prior to switching the deepspace 
drive, sensing infrequent molecules 
moving swiftly across our field 
of motion. But once hyper- 
drive switches were tripped, we sud- 
denly sensed the trigger phenome- 
non which is involved in our ac- 
tivation of mass sensing and other 
telekinetic phenomenon. 

There is no direct action phenom- 
enon capable of describing the 
experience. First, we were sensing 
matter in and around the space ship 
by means of these triggers, then we 
were able to sense the triggers them-* 
selves. 

Toby Randolph’s civilization had 



not consume time, while hyper-drive 
did. 

We entered the Quations system 
Uneventfully. Toby Randolph’s en- 
thusiasm was contagious. He was 
(ebullient, bubbling over with 
thoughts, words and anticipation 
for his civilization. 

My fellow Ayorians, too, were ex- 
cited. Soon they would fulfill the 
grouping decision to grow and to 
face the natural barriers in the out- 
er universe, far beyond the Enithra 
system. 

How did Spork fed? I was as nat- 
urally stimulated by the excitement 
around me. Who wouldn’t be? And 
I was certainly curious about Toby’s 
civilization as well as the biological 
source of my origin. Without ques- 
tion, the twinning problem I had 
accepted from Eme lay ahead, and 
this, too, prompted a great enthu- 
siasm. 

Down deep inside, though, Spork, 
the Ayorian moron, thought of his 
lush Enithra valleys. As to any 
other Ayorian, home is always 
Enithra!

DESTROYER 

by ROBERT WEINBERG 



The Pale Horsemen rode again 
— and now there were Five / 



T lived again 1 How many years 
it had been since my last re- 
vival I had no way of knowing. Nor 
did I care. All that mattered was 
that I lived again. Destruction 
walked again with death, to come 
hurtling from the void. The Four 
who were my brothers rode the 
skies, whispering in their harsh 
voices, welcoming me back to the 
living. 

Disease called to me. “ Brother, 
you have come to mount again? 
Will you ride with us, share our 
glories, crush those who seek to 
oppose us? Ride the night winds 
with us, brother!” 

* But of the four, Disease was the 
one whom I liked the least. His way 
was wasteful, never ceasing. He 



took strong men and made them 
weak. He was the coward of the 
four. So I answered him not. Soon 
his horse could not keep up with 
the pace of my steed, the starship 
Terror . Next to approach me was 
Famine. 

“Do you ride to destroy the 
crops, oh mightiest of all, my 
brother? Together, shall we make 
the worlds of men tremble again 
under our hoofs? Forget this mis- 
sion of yours. Abandon the fools 
who bring you back to life only 
when they need your powers. Leave 
them, desert them. Come ride with 
us. We four are feared, but the five 
of us would be Gods! Ride with 
us, brother!” 

His argument could not sway me, 



99 





for the automatic reflexes installed 
in my body would destroy my con- 
sciousness immediately upon the 
very thought of not fulfilling my 
mission. I had tried many times in 
the past, but those who created me 
knew too well the lusts which drove 
me. So, I rode onward, passing by 
Famine. 

Huge, powerful War was the 
third to come alongside my ship as 
it began to spiral down to the 
planet of my destination. The stupid 
foe, dim-witted but so very power- 
ful. Once he began to ride, no one 
had ever been able to stand in his 
path. No one, except me. 

“Brother!” he cried out in an- 
ger. “Stop. I command you to re- 
turn. You strive to cheat me of my 
due. Battle is brewing on this world 
below. It is not for you to upset 
my strivings. Go back, I tell you. 
Yon are one of us, but you work 
for those who oppose our aims. Go 
back!” 

I laughed at him. I knew that he 
could not harm me, for I was as 
powerful as he, if not more so. And 
he knew it too. Every time I rode, 
he threatened. And every time, he 
moved out of my path. “Go, my 
brother,” I called to him, not un- 
kindly. “There are many other 
worlds on which wars rage. This 
one could be too costly. It must be 
stopped, and only I can do this. 
Begone.” 

Like mists before my eyes, the 
first three riders dissolved into 



nothingness. Already, the Terror 
was roaring down into the planet’s 
atmosphere. The automatic controls 
had already taken over. They would 
land the ship in a pre-designated 
spot, where it would not easily be 
found. My thoughts were on an en- 
tirely different subject. A final 
rider had come galloping out of the 
darkness. The cowl which covered 
his features did not muffle his 
voice, the sound of crying winds. 
“So, we ride together, again, broth- 
er. I have waited long for your 
return.” 

“There has been a long peace?” 

“Three hundred years,” he re- 
plied, sweeping out with his scythe. 
“My blade has grown dull with 
just normal oiling. It will be good 
to drench it with life. 

Even I had to shudder at the 
way my brother turned a phrase. 
For I knew well the oil that his 
scythe used. No matter. Together 
we came riding down to this un- 
suspecting world. 

t times, I wondered if the 
cowled figure who walked be- 
side me in that blue forest of giant 
plants was real or just the ram- 
blings of a half-crazed mind. When 
I had first died, and part of my 
brain was transferred to this mach- 
ine, had I been secretly brought to 
believe that such beings as the Four 
Horsemen really existed? Were they 
just a mental compensation creat- 
ed by my memory banks to provide 

IF 




100 




the companionship that a man who 
lived only when he was needed des- 
perately craved. Or were they real, 
not dream figures, but ancient and 
powerful spirits? A man had never 
truly died and been brought back 
to life. Nor did any man ever exist 
with all the censors and moral codes 
in his mind completely destroyed, 
so that killing and destruction were 
his only function. I was a destroy- 
er, the first and only God of De- 
struction ever created. If the Horse- 
men did exist, would they not con- 
sider me their brother? 

The real and the unreal had long 
ago blended into one and the same. 
The answer to my puzzlings was 
no longer very important, merely 
the random thoughts of a freak 
machine. I could see Death, but to 
all others he was invisible and in- 
tangible. Yet when a man died, I 
saw Death let his mighty scythe 
swing. There is no answer to the 
unanswerable. 

The planet was totally dissimilar 
to Earth. The atmosphere was a mix- 
ture of various poisonous gases. 
This bothered me little, as I do not 
breathe. Why I had been sent had 
been fed into me via mempry units 
as I was returned to life on the 
voyage thru sub-space to this world. 
Earth was beginning to expand its 
empire into this section of the gal- 
axy. The humanoids of this world, 
the Ccern, had been at first quite 
friendly. They had no use for the 
Earth-type worlds in this area, any- 
DESTROYER 



way, as our atmosphere was as 
poisonous to them as theirs was to 
us. A long and useful period of 
cooperation between planets seem- 
ed in the making. That was until 
a new leader took over control of 
the government. Trre 8 and his co- 
horts refused to let any Earth col- 
onists settle the planets in the 
Ccern sector of space. He had de- 
liberately set to force Earth into a 
costly war, unless certain terms of 
his were met. The alien knew that 
it would be cheaper for the Terran 
empire to make concessions to his 
government than fight a war hun- 
dreds of light years away from 
the mother world. What Trre did 
not know was of my existence. 

Death’s low whisper broke me 
out of my reverie. “There are men 
up ahead?” The question signified 
humanoid beings, but not fully so. 
Was this a true question, or just 
subconscious compensation. 

“Yes, they are men,” I answered. 

Scythe held low, Death disap- 
peared in the darkness of the night. 
I crept forward alone. Beneath me, 
everywhere my hands touched, 
wherever my bare skin touched the 
ground, life died. My trail was an 
easy one to follow — thin line of 
death and destruction. 

T here were four of them, sol- 
diers by their uniforms and 
the weapons they carried. Probably 
part of a large search for my space 
ship. I cared little whether they 

101 




found it or not. When I left, it 
would not be by secrecy, if I left 

at all. 

They were taller than I, and very 
manlike in appearance. Only the 
absence of any nose or nostrils gave 
them an alien appearance. This 
made my job all the easier. It was 
not as if I were killing strangers. 
These beings could almost be call- 
ed men, thus putting them under 
my domain. From across the small 
clearing in which they stood, I saw 
Death waving his scythe. I walked 
out of the brush and into the open. 

They didn’t know what to do. 
Since I seemed to be unarmed and 
quite helpless before their weapons 
and the safety of odds, they let 
me approach without showing any 
great fear. One of them reached for 
the radio device clipped to his belt. 
“We have just found a survivor 
of that alien vessel, Commander 
Ywwe,” he reported in the sing-song 
language which was part of my mem- 
pry banks. “Yes, sir, alone and 
obviously harmless. There is one 
Strange thing, sir. He does not seem 
to need any breathing apparatus. 
Is not our atmosphere supposed to 
be deadly to these Earthlings ?” 

As he spoke, I kept on approach- 
ing. I was in luck. General Ywwe 
was one of the ruling cartel which 
I was sent to destroy. Already, the 
instruments in my chest had locat- 
ed the broadcast point of his trans- 
mitter. It was time for me to move 
into action. 



The soldier with the radio turned 
to his companions. The man had 
just switched off the communicator. 
This made my task even easier. 
Now the commander would have no 
warning of my approach. He would 
not learn of the patrol’s death un- 
til I revealed it to him myself. 
“The General says that we are to 
detain the alien until a medical 
team can get here.” 

I chuckled. The medical team 
would have been quite shocked if 
they could exam me. But I had 
other plans. By now I had come 
face to face with two of the four 
men. Their weapons raised, they 
appeared slightly nervous, but not 
afraid. Death swung his scythe 
into the back of one of the two as 
I reached out and touched his arm. 
He dropped to the earth, dead, the 
poison fed from my fingertips into 
his bloodstream killing instantly. 
The others raised their guns in hor- 
ror, but for them it was too late. 
I pursed my lips and whistled. The 
half computer part of my brain took 
over the sound, raising it to just 
the right pitch. Three aliens crum- 
pled as Death cut them down. Their 
brains were jelly, destroyed by the 
precise *high frequency sound that 
I had just emitted. Death looked 
at me, his cowl flung back. “To- 
night, brother, we live again,” he 
chuckled, his eye sockets gleaming 
horribly. My grin matched his 
toothy one. 

“Tonight,” I answered, “the evil

quiver. The world trembles. Men 
huddle in their caves with fear. To- 
night, I am master. Let my enemies 
beware. I have felt my power, and 
know that I am as strong as old. 
Now aloft, to the camp of the fool 
they call General. Away, for De- 
struction does ride!” 

'T'he camp of my enemies laid 
below me. Death whispered in 
my ear. “The structure with the 
force screen around must be the 
place of the commander.” 

“I too have eyes, bony brother. 
It is too well lit to try to land now. 
Come, let us destroy this camp of 
our enemy. Oil your blade.” 
Together we swooped down on 
the unsuspecting camp. The anti- 
noxious fumes issued from my 
gravs throughout my body propel- 
led me like a streak of dark light- 
ning. Every man I touched died, 
every one who heard my call also. 
My very breath was destruction, as 
mouth. The laser beam where my 
left eye should have been burned 
down those few who tried to flee. 
I killed without mercy, young and 
old, male and female. Those who 
begged for mercy died as swiftly as 
those who tried to fight me. Only 
the general, inside his force screen, 
remained alive. His radioed calls for 
help went unanswered as my track- 
ing apparatus blocked out every 
message he sent. By the time I 
called for him, the man was in a 
state of near shock. 



Trembling he watched me 
approach the force screen. My fin- 
gers went out and touched it. 
Energy flared for seconds and then 
went out. I was through. The gener- 
al didn’t even bother to raise his 
weapon. He knew that if the force 
screen could not stop me, no mere 
hand weapon could. “Who or what 
are you?” he asked in a voice 
trambling with fear. “No man can 
walk through an energy screen. No 
man can destroy an entire command 
of imperial soldiers. You interfer- 
red with my radio signals!” His 
voice was rising higher and higher. 
“Who are you? What are you?” 

.1 laughed. I laughed the laughter 
of the damned. “Men have spoken 
of me many times. Legends tell of 
Four Horsemen — Death, Famine, 
Disease and War. I am their broth- 
er, the strongest of all. I am . 
Destruction.” 

“Mad!” screamed the man in the 
high pitched voice of the insane. 
“The world is mad, the universe is 
mad.” He raised his weapon to his 
forehead. Death raised his scythe. 
But I still needed the General. 

My hand moved with the speed 
of the swiftest machine. The laser 
gun that the General held rum- 
pled under the force of my machine- 
driven fingers. “You cannot die,” 
I mocked. “Your life is mine.” 

*T 1 he General was in a state of 
shock. He could do nothing, 
say nothing. His whole world had 



DESTROYER 



103 




been destroyed before his eyes. 
The false skim that coated my body 
fooled him. If I had been shaped 
like any other robot or android, he 
might have been able to compre- 
hend such destruction. And even 
then, he would not have been able 
to credit his eyes, for no ordinary 
robot could be programmed for such 
a complex action as destruction in 
such varied manner. Only a com- 
bination of the two, the mentality 
of man, harsh, destructive and ruth- 
less, combined with the sheer power 
and ability of the machine could 
be such an agent of destruction. 

“Your command base?” I asked 
in a tone that could not be denied. 
“Where is it? Is General Trre in 
charge? Answer me, slave, or feel 
my wrath.” 

In reality, I could not torture 
him in the least. I could only kill. 
Everything about me was for quick, 
ruthless extermination. I was not 
programmed to be able to kill slow- 
ly. But the General did not know 
this. Listlessly he told me what I 
desired to know. I nodded. Death 
grinned and let his scythe arc as 
I touched the man’s arm. 

The blaring communicator re- 
minded me that my enemies would 
be prepared for my attack. But I 
was not worried. My mission was 
proceeding as planned. Turning on 
full force from my anti-gravs, I 
speed across the countryside. 

When I was only about five miles 
from the now dead camp, rockets 
104 



roared out of the sky and blew the 
area to atoms. The radiation bathed 
my artificial skin, adding new ener- 
gy to my storage banks. Smiling, 
I flew on, Death winging along be- 
side me. 

What was the truth? Was I an 
emissary, or Destruction? I knew 
my mission was that of terror, de- 
stroying all those who sought to 
stop me. I was one of the Horsemen 
but in a way, opposed them. For my 
mission prevented their evils. I 
killed the rulers, the ones who 
created wars and brought about 
famines. Death rode with me, taking 
the crumbs, but if I did not ride, 
he would have soaked his scythe 
in rivers of blood. I prevented war, 
for I destroyed all those who strove 
to start it. But if I worked for peace, 
why did I get such satisfaction 
from killing? Why was I so ruth- 
less, so terribly destructive? The 
Four Horsemen, whom I thwarted 
again and again, were my friends, 
yet I strove against them. I died 
many times, but each time I lived 
again. Why didn’t I have any mem- 
ory except for these missions — 
missions that took place over the 
span of hundreds of years? I was 
not immortal — or was I? I had 
died a hundred times, but yet I 
still lived. As the general asked, 
what was I? 

As I flew through the night air, 
^ I analyzed all my circuits. 
Everything was in perfect order. I 

IF 




was a fool to say that I knew noth- 
ing about myself. In reality, I knew 
everything, just could not admit 
the truth. 

Take a man who had just died, 
keep his brain alive with super- 
science until a new body was ready, 
and then transfer the now slightly 
altered organ into the machine 
which was to be its new home. Al- 
ter it so that killing would be part 
of the being’s nature, make de- 
struction its only goal. Control it 
by a small computer, ever linked 
with Earth. One that directed the 
half-man, half-machine in its tasks. 
Invent the most destructive ma- 
chine ever built, form it so that 
it appeared human even though its 
insides are stuffed with myriads of 
monstrous machines of death. 
Create a destroyer, a fifth Horse- 
man. Half mad from brain damage, 
nearly insane from lack of will or 
desires, entirely deadly with an 
armament capable of destroying a 
world — this was my identity. Dor- 
mant with my life flow at low ebb 
until I was needed, immortal and 
nearly indestructible, I was nearly 
a God, but not even a man. Once 
I had an identity, once I was hu- 
man. Now I was only a killing 
machine. The Fifth Rider: De- 
struction. 

I came upon the supreme head- 
quarters of Commander Trre dur- 
ing the late morning. His base was 
located in the middle of the main 
city of the world. I knew that I 
DESTROYER 



could never pass as a Ccern, but I 
also knew that every delay made 
my mission more difficult. I could 
not just destroy the entire area, for 
I was programmed against wanton 
killing. Scythe idle, Death waited 
while I pondered. I knew that there 
was but one answer. I would have 
to wait till nightfall, no matter what 
the consequences. 

Time passed so very slowly. The 
planet rotated once every thirty 
hours, so my wait was both dull 
and long. I had no way to amuse* 
myself, for the only emotion I felt 
was satisfaction when I had killed. 
I rechecked my circuits a hundred 
times. Death had drifted off, for 
he was never idle. I knew that he 
would return once I started to move. 

Finally, twilight came, and then 
night. The planet had no moon, and 
the starlight was not very bright. 
Silently I flew into the city. As I 
came to a stop, hovering over the 
Commander’s palace, Death came 
gliding out of the shadows. “They 
expect you, brother.” 

“No great surprise. But they 
don’t know what to expect. Nor 
when I come, or my powers, other 
than that I am very dangerous.” I 
laughed. “They do not know that 
tonight they face Destruction.” 

The palace had a steel roof. My 
laser eye cut a small gap in the 
metal, and I then proceeded to 
widen the opening with my hands, 
twisting away the jagged metal. “I 
create my own entrance, brother,” 

105 




I called to Death. “They could not 
be prepared for that. 

T was right and wrong. The en- 
^ tire palace was set so that any 
destruction or damage would set off 
alarms. The hall into which I had 
come filled up swiftly with soldiers. 

I whistled, but with no effect. 
These men were all wearing space 
suits. They could not be reached by 
sound or touch. The poison in my 
fingers was useless. I swallowed the 
poisonous gas in my lungs. My laser 
eye was my only weapon, and they 
had lasers which they used to fight 
back. 

My energy shield was at maxi- 
mum strength, but I knew that it 
could not stop coherent light for 
any length of time. I knew that my 
masters on Earth would never let 
this body be captured. The self- 
destruct mechanism within me had 
probably started. My personality 
already part of a huge memory 
bank on Earth, would not die. I 
was immortal. This body would 
perish. And I had not completed 
my mission. 

I retreated steadily before their 
onslaught. My laser took a toll of 
them, but for every one that died, 
two others took his place. Death 
laughed as he swung his scythe. 
“We have not lost yet, my brother. 
Look who watches!” 

General Trre! The fool was 
watching the battle from behind an

energy shield at the other end of 
the hall. He was guarded, but that 
did not worry me. With the General 
dead, his party would never be able 
to hold together. I had to destroy 
him before I was destroyed. There 
was only one chance left. My anti- 
gravs roared in protest as I went 
hurtling across the floor. A laser 
bolt penetrated my screen, fusing 
my legs into scrap. Already I could 
feel the machinery in my stomach 
crumbling under the acid which 
was to bring about my end. The 
General did not realize my intent 
until it was too late. I flashed 
through his energy screen just as 
my absorbers gave way. I was blind, 
with half my machinery gone, but 
my radar sense still located the re- 
treating man. Death waved me on- 
ward, as laser beams from Trre’s 
guards struck me again and again. 
But I would not be stopped. 

I flung myself at the man, hold- 
ing him in a grip of iron. A grip 
that could not be broken. They 
couldn’t use their lasers now. The 
General shrieked in terrible pain as 
the corrosive acid in my chest burst 
through and covered his body. Mor- 
tal flesh could not stand up against 
such destruction. The General died 
in seconds. My mission was fin- 
ished. 

“Until we ride again, Death I” I 
cried, and willed the final act of 
destruction. My own.

TOYS OF 
TAMISAN 

by ANDRE NORTON 

Illustrated by ADKINS 

The dream world Tamisan had made 
was out of control — and her only 
escape lay in finding a man who 
did not exist in that if-reality.

ted the space culture and joined the 
Confederacy . 

At the first dream session , how- 
ever, things are not normal . Kas is 
asked to join the dream she and 
Starrex will share , using a new 
dream linking machine . She falls 
into a dream at once — but it is 
all wrong. She is alone, and the 
world is strangely real . She seems 
Unable to control events. It is a 
culture filled with ancient magic 
and gods , and she is the Mouth of 
Olava, a seer ess in the service of 
the nobility. 

Summoned to foretell the future, 
she finds herself possessed and ca- 
pable of performing the ritual. She 
predicts that spacemen are about 
to invade the planet and that it 
must be saved by a champion — 
whom she realizes is Starrex. 

Shaken, she tries to break the 
dream, but cannot. She knows she 
is anchored by Starrex, and perhaps 
by Kas, both of whom' may be any- 
where in this world. To return, she 
must find them. 

Then she is summoned to the 
great inner city — a wreckage in 
her world — ruled by the OVER- 
QUEEN, who demands she repeat 
the prediction. She does, but the 
Over-Queen is not impressed. They 
knew the spaceship was coming — 
and there have been other space- 
ships, which they have destroyed 
in the past. She demands that 
Tamisan produce this champion. 

By an uncanny ritual that Tami- 
168 



san somehow knows, she does lo- 
cate * Starrex among the Over- 
Queen’s guards. But the Over- 
Queen promptly orders him and 
Tamisan into prison. Here he oc- 
cupies the body of an other-self 
known as HAWAREL, who stands 
already accused of treason. 

Under Tamisan’ s prodding, he 
admits he is Starrex and Hawarel, 
fused into double memories, and it 
was his confusion by the Starrex 
memories that led to his seeming 
treason. She tries to break the 
dream with him, but still fails. She 
feels that it can only be done when 
they find Kas, whom she believes 
must be among the crew of the com- 
ing spaceship. 

Later, they are summoned under 
guard. The Over-Queen intends to 
meet the spaceship when it lands 
and is taking Hawarel along as the 
“champion” Tamisan predicted. 
They go out where the wrecks of 
other spaceships lie, to wait for 
the latest one. Seeing the fearsome 
weapons on those ships, she can- 
not understand how they were sub- 
dued. 

But now the Over-Queen plans 
to send Hawarel out to face a ship 
with only a sword against it. And 
with him, she announces that Tami- 
san must go to share his fate. 

As the Over -Queen smiles mock- 
ingly after delivering this obvious 
death sentence to them, the great 
ship comes dawn on a trail of fire 
and lands, awaiting them! 



IF

B y the light of those flames, 
the whole plain was illum- 
ined. Beyond stood the hulk of the 
unfortunate spacer which had last 
planeted here. And there, drawn up 
in lines was a large force of spear- 
men, crossbowmen, officers with 
the basket-hilted weapons at their 
sides. However, as they stood they 
might seem a guard of honor for 
the Over-Queen, who sat raised 
above the rest on a very tall chair 
cart — certainly not an army in 
battle array. 

And those in the ship — they 
might well look contemptuously on 
such archaic weapons as useless. 
How had those of Ty-Kry taken 
the other ship and her crew? By 
wiles, treachery — as the victims 
might declare — or by dever tricks, 
suggested that part of Tamisan 
who was the Mouth of Olava. 

The surface of the ground boiled 
away under the descent rockets. 
Then the bright fires vanished, 
leaving the plain in semi-darkness 
until their eyes adjusted to the far 
lesser light of the torches. 

There was no expression of awe 
by the waiting crowd. Though they 
might be, by their trappings, dress 
and arms, accounted centuries be- 
hind the technical knowledge of the 
newcomers, they were braced by 
their history to know that they 
were not to face gods of unknown 
powers but mortals with whom they 
TOYS OF TAMISAN 



had successfully fought before. 
What gave them this barrier against 
the star rovers, Tamisan wonder- 
ed, and why were they so adverse 
to any contact with star civiliza- 
tion? Apparently they were con- 
tent to stagnate at a level of civi- 
lization perhaps five hundred years 
behind her world. Did they not 
produce any inquiring minds any 
who desired to do things different- 
ly? 

The ship was down and gave no 
outward sign of life, though Tami- 
san knew its scanners must be busy 
feeding back what information they 
gathered to appear on video- 
screens. If those had picked up the 
derelict ship, the newcomers would 
have so much of a warning. She 
glanced from the silent bulk of the 
newly landed spacer to the Over- 
Queen, j'ust in time to see the ruler 
raise her hand in a gesture. Four 
men came forward from the ranks 
of nobles and guards. Unlike the 
latter, they wore no body armor 
nor helms, only short tunics of an 
unrelieved black. And in the hands 
of each was a bow — not the cross- 
bow of the troops, but the yet old- 
er hand-bow of expert archers. 

That part of Tamisan which was 
of this world knew a catch of 
breath. For those bows were un- 
like any other in the land, and 
those who held them unlike any 
other archers. No wonder ordinary 
men and women gave them wide 
room. For they were a monstrous 

109 




lot. Over the heads of each was 
fitted so skillfully fashioned a mask 
that it seemed no mask at all, rath- 
er their natural features, save that 
the features were not those of hu- 
man men, but rather copies of the 
great heads which surmounted, one 
for each point of the compass, the 
defensive walls of Ty-Kry. Neither 
human nor animals, but something 
of both, and something beyond 
both. 

And the bows they raised were 
fashioned of treated human bone, 
strung with cords woven of human 
hair. The bones and hair of ancient 
enemies and ancient heroes, so that 
the intermingled strength of both 
were ready to serve the living now. 

T?rom closed quivers each took 
a single arrow, and in the 
torchlight those arrows glittered, 
seeming to draw and condense ra- 
diance until they were shafts of 
solid light. Fitted to the cords, they 
had a hypnotic effect, holding one’s 
attention to the exclusion of all else. 
Tamisan was suddenly aware of 
that and tried to break the attrac- 
tion, but at that moment the ar- 
rows were fired. And her head 
turned with all the rest in that com- 
pany to watch the flight of what 
seemed to be lines of fire across 
the dark sky, rising up and up un- 
til they were well above the dark 
ship, then following a curve, to 
plunge out of sight behind it. 

Oddly enough, in their passing 
no 



they had left great arcs of light 
behind which did not fade at once, 
but cast faint gleams on the bub- 
ble of the ship. Ingathering — one 
part of Tamisan’s mind supplied 
— a laying on of ancient power to 
influence those in the spacer. 
Though that of her which was a 
dreamer could not so readily be- 
lieve in the effeciency of any such 
ceremony. 

There had been sound with the 
arrows’ passing, a shrill high whis- 
tling which hurt the ears so that 
those in that throng put hands to 
the sides of their heads to shut out 
the screech. A wind arose out of 
nowhere and with it a loud crack- 
ling. Tamisan looked up to see 
above the Over-Queen’s head a 
large bird flapping wings of gold 
and blue, until a closer look said it 
was no giant bird but rather a ban- 
ner so fashioned that the wind set 
it flying to counterfeit the action. 

The black-dad archers still stood 
in a line a little out from the ranks 
of the guards. And now, though the 
Over-Queen made no visible sign, 
those about Hawarel and Tamisan 
urged them forward until they 
came to front both those archers 
and the Over-Queen’s tall throne 
cart. 

“Well, champion, is it in your 
mind to carry out the duties this 
busy Mouth has assigned you?” 
There was jeering in the Over- 
Queen’s question, as if she did not 
honestly believe in Tamisan’s 

IF 




prophecy but was willing to allow 
a dupe to march to destruction in 
his own way. 

Hawarel went to one knee; but 
as he did so, he swung his empty 
sword sheath across his knee, mak- 
ing very visible the fact that he 
lacked a weapon. 

“At your desire, Great One, I 
stand ready. But is it your will 
that my battle be without even 
steel between me and the enemy?” 

'T'amisan saw a smile on the lips 
of the Over-Queen. And at 
that moment, she glimpsed a little 
into this ruler — that it might just 
please her to will such a fate on 
Hawarel. But if the Over-Queen 
played with that thought for an in- 
stant or two, she put it aside. Now 
she gestured. 

“Give him steel, and let him use 
it. The Mouth has said he is the 
answer to our defense this time. 
Is that not so, Mouth?” 

And the look she gave to Tami- 
san had a cruel core. 

“He has been chosen in the far- 
seeing. And twice has it read so.” 
Tamisan found the words to an- 
swer in a firm voice, as if what she 
said was an absolutely unchangeable 
decree. 

The Over-Queen laughed. “Be 
firm, Mouth, put your will behind 
this choice of yours. In fact, do 
you go with him, to give him the 
support of Olaval” 

Hawarel had accepted a sword 
TOYS OF TAMISAN 



from the officer on his left. Now 
he arose to his feet, swinging that 
blade as he saluted with a flourish 
which suggested that, if he knew 
he were going to extinction, he in- 
tended to march there as one who 
moved to trumpets and drums. 

“The Right be strength to your 
arm, a shield to your body,” in- 
toned the Over-Queen. But there 
was that in her voice which one 
might detect to mean that the words 
she spoke were only ritual, not in- 
tended to encourage this champion. 

Hawarel turned to face the si- 
lent ship. From the burnt and 
blasted ground about its landing 
fins arose trails of steam and 
smoke. Small, red, charring ran in 
lines away from that ruin. The 
faint arcs which had remained in 
the air from the arrow flights were 
gone now. 

As Hawarel moved forward, 
Tamisan followed a pace or two 
behind. Though if the ship re- 
mained closed to them, with no en- 
trance hatch opened and no ramp 
run forth, she did not see how they 
could carry out their plans. And 
what if that were so, would the 
Over-Queen expect them to wait 
hour after hour for some decision 
from the spacer’s commander as to 
whether or not he would contact 
them? 

Fortunately the spacecrew were 
more enterprising. Perhaps the 
sight of that hulk on the edge of 
the field had given them the need 

Hi 




to learn more. The hatch which 
opened was not the large entrance 
one, but a smaller door above one 
of the fins; and from it shot a 
stunner beam. 

Luckily it caught its prey, both 
Hawarel and Tamisan, before they 
had reached the edge of the sullen- 
ly burning turf, so that their sud- 
denly hdpless bodies did not fall 
into that fire. Nor did they lose 
consciousness — only the ability 
to control slack muscles. 

Tamisan had crumpled face 
down, and only the fact that one 
cheek pressed the earth gave her 
room to breathe. But her sight was 
sharply curtailed to the edge of 
burning grass which crept inexor- 
ably on toward her. Seeing that, 
she forgot all else. 

'T'hose moments were the worst 
she had ever spent. She had 
conjured up narrow escapes in 
dreams, but always there had been 
the knowledge that at the last mo- 
ment escape was possible. Now 
there was no escape, only her help- 
less body and the line of advancing 
fire. 

With the suddenness of a blow 
delivering a shock through her still 
painful bruises, she was caught, 
right side and left, by what felt 
like giant pinchers. As those closed 
about her body, she was drawn 
aloft, still face down, the fumes and 
heat of the burning vegetation 
choking her. She coughed until the 
112 



spasm made her sick, spinning in 
that brutal clutch, being drawn to 
the spacer, as if the ship had shot 
forth a robot’s arm to pull her in. 

She came into a burst of daz- 
zling light. Then hands seized up- 
on her, pulling her down, but hold- 
ing her upright. The force of the 
stunner was wearing off; they must 
have set the beam on lowest pow- 
er. There was the prickle of feeling 
returning in her legs and her heavy 
arms. She was able to lift her head 
a fraction, to see men in space uni- 
forms about her. They wore hel- 
mets as if expecting to issue out 
on a hostile world, and some of 
them had the visors closed. Two 
picked her up easily and carried 
her along, down a corridor, before 
dropping her without any gentle- 
ness in a small cabin with a sus- 
picious likeness to a cell. 

Tamisan lay on the floor, recov- 
ering command of her own body 
and trying to think ahead. Had 
they taken Hawarel, too? There 
was no reason to believe they had 
not. But he had not been put in 
this cell. She was able to sit up 
now, her back supported by the 
wall, and she smiled shakily at her 
thought that their brave boast of 
a championship battle had certain- 
ly been brought quickly to naught. 
Not that the Over-Queen’s desires 
might have run far counter to what 
happened. But she and Starrex had 
gained this much of their own ob- 
jective: they were in the ship she 

IF 




believed also held Kas. Only let the 
three of them make contact and 
they could leave the dream. And 
— would their leaving shatter this 
dream world? How real was it? 
She was sure of nothing, and there 
was no reason to worry over side 
issues. The time had come to con- 
centrate upon one thing only — 
Kas. 

What should she do? Pound on 
the door of this cell to demand at- 
tention — to speak with the com- 
mander of this ship? Ask then to 
see all his crew so she could pick 
out Kas in his this-world masquer- 
ade? She had a suspicion that 
while Hawarel-Starrex had accept- 
ed her story, no one else might. 

The important thing was some 
kind of action to get her free and 
let her search . 

The door was actually opening! 
Tamisan was startled by what 
seemed a quick answer to her need. 

X 

ere was no helmet on the man 
who stood there, though he 
wore a tunic bearing the insignia 
of an upperofficer, slightly differ- 
ent from that Tamisan knew from 
her own Ty-Kry. He also had a 
stunner aimed at her, while at his 
throat was the box of a vocal in- 
terpreter. 

“I come in peace — ” 

"With a weapon in hand?” she 
countered. 



He looked surprised; he must 
have expected a foreign tongue in 
answer. But she had replied in the 
Basic which was the second lan- 
guage of all Confederacy planets. 

"We have reason to believe that 
weapons are necessary with your 
people. I am Glanden Tork of Sur- 
vey.” 

"I am Tamisan and a Mouth of 
Olava.” Her hand went to her head 
and discovered that somehow, in 
spite of her passage through the 
air and her lacking-in-ceremony en- 
trance into the ship, her crown was 
still there. Then she pressed the 
important question: 

"Where is the champion?” 

"Your companion?” The stun- 
ner was no longer centered on her 
and his tone had lost some of its 
belligerency. "He is in safekeep- 
ing. But why do you name him 
champion?” 

"Because that is what he is — 
come to engage your selected 
champion in Right battle.” 

"I see. And we select a champion 
in return, is that it? What is Right- 
battle?” 

She answered his last question 
first. "If you claim land, you meet 
the champion of the lordship of 
that land in Right-battle.” 

"But we claim no land,” he pro- 
tested. 

"You made claim when you set 
your fiery ship down on the fields 
of Ty-Kry.” 

"Your people then consider our 

113 




TOYS OF TAMISAN 




landing a form of invasion? But 
this can be decided by a single com- 
bat between champions? And we 
pick our man — ” 

Tamisan interrupted him. “Not 
so. The Mouth of Olava selects — 
or rather the sand selects — the 
seeing selects. That is why I have 
come, though you did not greet me 
in honor.” 

“You select the champion — 
how?” 

“As I have said — by the See- 
ing.” 

“I do not see, but doubtless it 
will be made plain in the proper 
time. And where then is this com- 
bat fought?” 

“Out there.” She waved to what 
she thought was the ship walls. “On 
the land being claimed.” 

“Logical,” he conceded. And 
then he spoke as if to the air around 
them. “All that recorded?” Since 
the air did not answer him, he was 
apparently satisfied by silence. 

“This is your custom, Lady — 
Mouth of Olava. But since it is 
not ours, we must discuss it. By 
your leave we shall do so.” 

“As you wish.” She had this 
much on her side, he had intro- 
duced himself as a member of Sur- 
vey, which meant that he had been 
trained in the necessity of under- 
standing alien folkways. And the 
underlying principle of such train- 
ing wherever possible was to fol- 
low planet customs. If the crew did 
accept this idea of championship, 



then they might also be willing to 
follow it completely. She could de- 
mand to see every member of the 
crew, thus find Kas. And once that 
was done — break-dream! 

B ut, Tamisan told herself now, 
do not count on too easy an 
end to this venture. There was a 
nagging little doubt lurking in the 
back of her mind, and it had some- 
thing to do with those death arrows, 
with the hulk of the derelict. The 
people of Ty-Kry, seemingly so 
weakly defended, had managed 
through centuries to keep their 
world free of spacers. When she 
tried to plumb the Tamisan-of-this- 
world’s memories as to how that was 
accon iplished, she had no answer but 
what corresponded to magic forces 
only partly understood. That the 
shooting of the arrows was the first 
step in bringing such forces into 
being she was aware. Beyond that 
seemed only to lie a belief akin to 
her Mouth power, and that she did 
not understand, even when she 
employed it. 

She was accepting all of this, 
Tamisan realized suddenly, as if 
this world did exist, that it was not 
a dream out of her control. Could 
Starrex’s suggestion be the truth, 
that they had by some means trav- 
eled into an alternate world? 

Her patience was growing short; 
she wanted action. Waiting was very 
difficult. She was sure that scan- 
ners of more than one kind were 



174 



IF 




trained on her and she must play 
the part of a Mouth of Olava, dis- 
playing no impatience, only calm 
confidence in herself and her mis- 
sion. That she held to as best she 
could. 

Perhaps the time she waited 
seemed longer than it really was. 
But Tork returned, to usher her out 
of the cell and escort her up ladder 
from level to level. She found the 
long skirts of her robe difficult to 
manage. The cabin they came into 
was large and well furnished, and 
there were several men seated there. 
Tamisan looked from one to another 
searchingly. But she could not tell, 
she felt none of the uneasiness she 
had known in the throne room when 
Hawarel had been present. Of 
course, that could mean Kas was not 
one of this group, though a Sur- 
vey ship did not carry a large crew 
— mainly specialists of several dif- 
ferent callings. There were prob- 
ably ten, even twenty, more than 
the six before her. 

Tork led her to a chair which 
had some of the attributes of an 
easirest, molding it to her comfort 
as she settled into it. 

“This is Captain Lewald, Medico 
Thrum, Pyscho-Tech Sims, Hist- 
Techneer El Hamdi.” Tork named 
names and each man acknowledged 
with a half bow. “I Have outlined 
your proposal to them and they 
have discussed the matter. By what 
means will you select a champion 
from among us?” 

TOYS OF TAMISAN 



Qhe had no sand. For the first 
^ time, Tamisan realized that handi- 
cap. She would have to depend upon 
touch alone, but somehow she was 
sure that would reveal Kas to her. 

“Let your men come to me, touch- 
ing hand to mine,” she raised hers 
to lay it palm up on the table. 
“When I clasp that of him whom 
Olava selects, I shall know it.” 

“It seems simple enough,” the 
Captain returned. “Let us do as the 
lady suggests.” And he leaned for- 
ward to rest his own for a minute 
on hers. There was no response, nor 
was there any in the others. The 
Captain called an order on the in- 
tercom, and one by one the other 
members of the crew came to her, 
touching palm to palm, while Tami- 
san, with mounting uneasiness, be- 
gan to believe she had erred. Per- 
haps only by the sand could she 
detect Kas. Though she searched 
the face of each as he took his seat 
opposite her and laid his hand 
on hers, she could see no resem- 
blance to Starre’s cousin, nor was 
there any inner warning her man 
was here. 

“That was the last,” the Captain 
said as the final man arose. “Which 
is our champion?” 

“He is not here.” She blurted 
out the truth, her distress breaking 
through her caution. 

“But you have touched hands 
with every man on board this 
ship,” the Captain answered her. 
“Or is this some trick — ” 



ns 




He was interrupted by a sound 
sharp enough to startle. And the 
chanted numbers which spilled 
from the com by his elbow' meant 
nothing to Tamison but brought the 
rest in that cabin into instant ac- 
tion. A stunner in Tork’s hand 
caught her before she could rise, 
and once more she was conscious 
but unable to move. As the other 
officers pushed through the door 
on the run, Tork put out his hand, 
holding her limp body erect in the 
chair, while with the other he 
thumbed some alarm button set in- 
to the table. 

His summons was speedily an- 
swered by two crewmen who carried 
her along, to thrust her once more 
into a cabin. This was getting to 
be far too regular a procedure, 
Tamisan thought ruefully as they 
tossed her negligently on a bunk, 
hardly pausing to see if she landed 
safely on its surface or not. What- 
ever that alert had meant, it had 
certainly once more brought her to 
the status of prisoner. 

Apparently sure of the stunner 
beam, her guard went out, leaving 
the door open a crack so that she 
could hear the pad of running feet, 
the dangs of what could be second- 
ary alarms. 

W hat possible attack had the 
forces of the Over-Queen 
laimched against a well-armed and 
already alert spacer? Yet it was 
plain that those men believed them- 
114 



selves in danger and were on the de- 
fensive. Starrex — and Ras. Where 
was Kas? The Captain said she had 
met all on board. Did that mean 
that the vision she had earlier seen 
was false, that the faceless man in 
the spacer dress was a creature of 
her too active imagination? 

She must not lose confidence. 
Kas was here — he had to be! She 
lay now trying vainly to guess by 
the sounds what was happening. 
But the first flurry of noise and 
movement were stilled; there was 
only silence. Hawarel — where was 
Hawarel? 

The stunner’s power was wearing 
off. She had pulled herself up some- 
what groggily when the door of the 
cabin shot into its wall crack and 
Tork and the Captain stood there. 

“Mouth of Olava, or whatever 
you truly are,” the Captain said, 
with a chill in his voice which re- 
minded Tamisan of Hawarel’s 
earlier rage, “the winning of time 
may not have been of your devising 
— this nonsense of Champions 
and Right-battle — or perhaps it 
was. Your superiors perhaps de- 
ceived you too. At any rate, now it 
does not matter. They have done 
their best to make us prisoner and 
will not reply to our signals for a 
parley. So we must use you for our 
messenger. Tell your ruler that we 
hold her champion and we can 
readily use him as a key to open 
gates shut in our faces. We have 
weapons beyong swords and spears, 

IF 




even beyond those which might 
not have saved those in that other 
ship. She can tie us here for a 
measure of time, but we can solve 
such bonds. We have not come as 
invaders, no matter what you be- 
lieve, nor are we alone. If our sig- 
nal does not reach our sister ship in 
orbit above, there will be such an 
accounting as your race has not 
seen, nor can conceive of. We shall 
release you now and you will tell 
your Queen this. If she does not 
send those to talk with us before 
the dawn — then it will be the 
worse for her. Do you understand?” 

“And Hawarel?” Tamisan asked. 

1 “Hawarel?” 

“The champion. You will keep 
him here?” 

“As I have said, we have the 
means to make him a key for your 
fortress doors. Tell her that, Mouth. 
From what we have read in your 
champion’s mind you have certain 
authority here which ought to im- 
press your Queen.” 

Read from Starrex’s mind? What 
did they mean? Tamisan was sud- 
denly fearful. Some kind of mind- 
probe?, But if they did that, then 
they must know the rest. She was 
utterly confused now, and found it 
veiy hard to center her attention 
on the matter at hand, that she 
must relay this defiant message to 
the Over-Queen* And, since there 
seemed to be nothing she could do 
to protest that action, she would do 
so. Though what reception she

might have in Ty-Kry — Tamisan 
shuddered as Tork pulled her frpjn 
the bunk and half carried, half led 
her along. 

XI 

F or the third time Tamisan satin 
prison, but this time she looked 
not at the smooth walls of a space- 
ship cabin, but had the ancient 
stones of the High Castle ringing 
her in. Captain Lewald’s estimation 
of her influence with the Over- 
Queen had fallen far wide of the 
truth, and her plea in favor of a 
parley with the spacemen had been 
overruled at once, while the threat 
concerning their strange weapons 
and their mysterious use of Haw- 
arel as a “key” was laughed at. The 
fact that those of Ty-Kry had suc- 
cessfully dealt with this menace in 
the past made them confident that 
their same devices would serve as 
well now. And what those devices 
were Tamisan had no idea, save 
that something had happened to 
the ship before she had been un- 
ceremoniously bundled out of it. 

Hawarel they had kept on board, 
Kas had disappeared — and until 
she had both to hand she was in- 
deed a captive. Kas — her thoughts 
kept turning back to the fact he 
had not been among those who had 
faced her. Yet Lewald had assured 
her that she had seen all his 
crew — 

Wait I She set herself to recall 

117 




his every word — what had he 
said? “You have touched hand with 
every man aboard this ship.” But 
he had not said all the crew. Had 
there been one outside the ship? 
All she knew of space travel she 
had learned from tapes. But those 
had been very detailed as they 
needed to be to supply the dream- 
ers with factual background and 
inspiration from which to build 
fantasy worlds. This spacer claimed 
to be a Survey vessel and not 
operating alone. Therefore — it 
might really have a companion in 
orbit, and there Kas could be. But, 
if that were so, die had no chance 
of reaching him. 

Now if this, were only a true 
dream — Tamisan sighed, leaned 
her head back against the dank 
stone of the wall and then jerked 
away from that support as its chill 
struck into her shoulders. 
Dreams — 

Suppose — she sat upright, alert 
and a little excited — suppose she 
could dream within a dream — and 
find Kas that way? Was it possible? 
You could not tell until you proved 
it in one manner or another. She had 
no stablizer, no booster. But those 
were only needed when a dream was 
shared. She might venture as well 
on her own. But if she dreamed 
within a dream, could she do aught 
to set matters right? Why ask ques- 
tions she could not answer until it 
was put to the proof? 

She stretched out on the stones 



of the cell floor, resolutely blocking 
off those portions of her mind 
which were aware of the present 
discomfort of her body. Instead, 
she began the deep, even breathing 
of a dreamer, fastening her thoughts 
on the pattern of self-hypnosis 
which was the door to her dream. 
But all she had as a goal was Kas 
and he as he was in his real person. 
So poor a guide! 

She was going under — she could 
still dream! 

TTTalls built up around her. Only 
* * these were of a translucent 
material through which flowed soft 
and pleasing colors. It could not be 
a space ship. Then the scene waver- 
ed, and swiftly Tamisan thrust aside 
that doubt which might puncture 
the dream fabric. The walls 
sharpened, fixed into a solid state: 
this was a corridor, facing her a 
door. 

She willed to see beyond and was 
straightway, after the manner of a 
proper dream, jn that chamber. 
Here the walls were hung with the 
same sparkling web stuff which had 
lined her chamber in the sky tower. 
Seeking Kas, she had returned to 
her own world. But she held the 
dream, curious as to why her aim 
had brought her here. Had die 
been wrong, and had Kas never 
come with her? Blit if that were so, 
why had she and Starrex been 
marooned in the other dream? 

There was no one in the chamber, 

IF 



118 




but she felt that faint pull drawing 
her on. She sought Kas and there 
was that which promised he was 
here. A second room. Entering, she 
was startled. For this she knew and 
well — it was the room of a dream- 
er. And Kas stood by an empty 
couch, while the other was occupied. 

The dreamer wore a sharing 
crown, but what rested on the other 
couch was not any second sleeper 
but a squat box of metal, to which 
her dream cords were attached. 
And Tamisan was not the dreamer! 
She had expected to see herself 
Instead the entranced was one of 
the locked minds, the blankness of 
her countenance was unmistakeable. 
Dream force was being created here 
by an indreamer, and seemingly it 
was harnessed to that box. 

Given such clues, Tamisan pro- 
jected the rest. This was not the 
same dreaming chamber where she 
had fallen asleep; rather it was a 
smaller room. And Kas was very 
much awake, intent upon some dials 
on the box top. The indreamer and 
the box, locked so together, could 
be holding them in the other world. 
But what of that faint vision of 
Kas in Ship’s uniform? To mislead 
her? Or was this a misleading 
dream, dictated by the suspicions 
she had detected in Starrex con- 
cerning his cousin? For this was the 
logical reasoning from such sus- 
picions, that she had been sent 
with Starrex into a dream world 
and therein locked by this indream- 
120 



er and machine — real or dream? 

Was she now visible to Kas? If 
this were a dream, she should be. 
If she had come back to reality — 
Her head reeled under the listing 
of things which might be true, un- 
true, half true. To prove at least 
one small fraction, she moved for- 
ward and laid her hand on that of 
Kas as he leaned over to make some 
small adjustment to the box. 

He gave a startled exclamation, 
jerked his hand from under hers 
and glanced around. But, though 
he stared straight at her, it was 
plain he saw nothing; she could be 
as disembodied as a spirit in one 
of the old tales. Yet if he had not 
seen her, he had felt something. 

A gain he leaned over the box, eye- 
ing it intently as if he thought 
he must have felt some shock or 
emanation from it. The dreamer 
never moved. Save for the slow rise 
and fall of her breathing, which told 
Tamisan she was indeed deep in 
her self-induced and created world, 
she might have been dead. Her face 
was very wan and colorless. See- 
ing that, Tamison was uneasy. This 
tool of Kas’s had been far too long 
in an uninterrupted dream. She 
would have to be awakened if she 
made no move to break it for her- 
self. One of the dangers of indream- 
ing was this possible loss of the 
power to break a dream. That 
occuring, the guardian must break 
it. Most of the dreamers’ caps pro- 

IF 




vided the necessary stimulus to do 
so. Only the cap of this dreamer’s 
head had certain modifications 
Tamisan had never seen before, and 
these might prevent breaking — 

What would happen if Tamisan 
could evoke waking? Would that 
also release her — and Starrex — 
wherever he might be now — from 
their dream, return them to the 
proper world? She was well drilled 
in the technique of deep dream 
break. But those she had used when 
she stood in reality beside a victim 
who had overstayed the proper 
dream time. 

She reached out a hand, touched 
the pulse on the sleeper’s throat 
and applied slight massage. But 
though her hands seemed corporal 
and solid to her, there was no re- 
sponse in the other. To prove a 
point, Tamisan aimed a finger, 
thrusting it deeply as she could in- 
to the pillow on which the dreamer’s 
head rested. Her finger did not dent 
that soft roundness, but rather went 
into it, as if her flesh and bone had 
no substance. 

There was yet another way. It 
was harsh and used only in cases 
of exterminty. But to Tamisan this 
could be no else. She put those un- 
substantial fingers on the temples 
of the sleeper, just below the rim 
of the dream cap, and concen- 
trated on a single command. Awake 

The sleeper stirred, her features 
convulsed and a low moan came 
from her. Kas uttered an exclama- 



tion, hung over his box, his fingers 
busy pushing buttons with a care 
which suggested he was about a 
very delicate task. 

“Awake!” Tamisan commanded 
with such force as she could sum- 
mon. 

The sleeper’s hands arose very 
slowly, unsteadily from her sides 
and wavered up toward the cap, 
though her eyelids did not raise. 
Her expression was now one of 
pain. And Kas, breathing hard and 
fast, kept to his adjustments on the 
box. 

So they fought their silent bat- 
tle for possession of the dreamer. 
And slowly Tamisan was forced to 
concede that whatever force lay in 
that box, it overrode all the tech- 
nique she knew. But, the longer 
Kas kept this poor wretch under, 
the weaker she would grow. Death 
would be the answer, though per- 
haps that did not trouble him. 

Tf she could not wake the dream- 
^ er, break the bonds which she 
was certain now were what tied her 
and Starrex to that other world, 
then she must somehow get at Kas 
himself. He had responded to her 
touch before — therefore he might 
just — 

Tamisan slipped away from the 
head of the couch and came to 
stand behind Kas. He straightened 
up, a faint relief mirrored on his 
face as he studied the dreamer, and 
apparently his box reported that 

121 



TOYS OF TAMISAN 




there was no longer any disturb- 
ance. 

Now Tamisan raised her hands 
to either side of his head, spread- 
ing wide her fingers so they might 
in someway ape the expanse of a 
dreamer’s cap, and then brought 
them swiftly down to cover his 
head, putting firm touch on his 
temples though she could not exert 
real pressure there. 

T Te gave a muffled cry and tossed 
his head from side to side 
as if to free himself from a cloud. 
But Tamisan, with all the deter- 
mination of which she was capable, 
held fast. 

She had already seen this done 
once in the Hive. However then it 
had been used on a docile and will- 
ing subject and both the controlled 
and the dreamer had been on the 
same plane of existence. Now she 
could only hope that she could dis- 
rupt Kas’s train of thought long 
enough to make him release the 
dreamer himself. So she brought to 
bear all her will to that purpose. 
He was not only shaking his head 
from side to side now, making it 
very hard to keep her fingers in 
the proper position, but he was 
swaying back and forth, his hands 
up, clawing as if to tear her hold 
away, though it appeared he could 
not touch her any more than she 
could lay firm grip on him. 

That fund of energy which had 
enabled her to create strange worlds 
122 



and hold them for a fellow dream- 
er was bent to the task of influ- 
encing Kas. But to her dismay, 
though he ceased his frenzied 
movements and his clawing for the 
hands he could not clutch growing 
feebler, and though his eyes closed 
and his face screwed into such an 
expression of horror and rejection 
that it was that of a frightened 
child, he did not move to the box. 

Instead, he slumped forward so 
suddenly that Tamisan was taken 
wholly unaware, falling half across 
the divan. And in that fall he 
flailed out with an arm to send the 
box smashing to the floor, its 
weight dragging the cap in turn 
from the dreamer. 

Ohe drew several deep breaths, her 
^ haggard face now displaying a 
small trace of returning color. Tam- 
isan, still startled at the results of 
her efforts to influence Kas, began 
to wonder if she might have made 
matters worse. She did not know 
how much the box had to do with 
their transportation to the alternate 
world and whether, if it was bro- 
ken, they would ever be able to 
return or not. 

There was one precaution, if she 
could take it. If she returned to 
that prison cell in the High Castle 

— as she must do or leave Star- 
rex-Hawarel lost forever — then to 
leave Kas here, perhaps able again 
to use his machine — no! But how 

— since she could not — 



IF 




XII 



'T'amisan looked to the stirring 
dreamer. The girl was strug- 
gling from the depths of so deep a 
strata of unconsciousness that she 
was not aware of what lay about 
her. In this state she might be pli- 
able. Tamisan could only try. 

Leaving Kas, she went back to 
the dreamer. Once more, touching 
the girl’s forehead, she sought to 
influence. 

The dreamer sat up with such 
slow movements of body and limbs 
as one might use if almost unbear- 
able weights were fastened to ev- 
ery muscle. In a painfully slow 
gesture, she raised her hands to her 
head, groping for the cap no longer 
there. Then she sat, her eyes still 
shut, while Tamisan drew heavily 
on her own strength to deliver a 
final set of orders. 

Blindly, for she never opened 
her eyes, the dreamer felt along the 
edge of the couch on which she had 
lain, until her hand swept against 
the cords which fastened the cap 
to the box. Her lax fingers fumbled 
and then tightened as she gave a 
feeble jerk, then another, until 
both cords pulled free. Holding 
those still in one hand, she slipped 
from the couch in a forward move- 
ment which brought her to her 
knees, the upper part of her body 
on the other couch, one cheek 
touching that of the unconscious 
Kas. 



The strain on Tamisan was very 
great. She was wavering in her con- 
trol now; several times those weak 
hands fell limply as her hold on 
the dreamer ebbed. But each time 
she found some small surge of en- 
ergy which brought them back in- 
to action again. So that at last the 
cap was on Kas, the cords which 
had connected it to the box in a 
half coil on which the dreamer’s 
head rested. 

So big a chance and with such 
poor equipment! Tamisan could 
not be sure of any results, she 
could only hope. Tamisan had re- 
leased her command of the dream- 
er, who now lay against the couch 
on one side as Kas half lay on the 
other. She summoned all that she 
had, all that she sensed she had 
always possessed, that small differ- 
ence in dream power she had se- 
cretly cherished. Once .more she 
touched the forehead of the sleep- 
ing girl and broke her own dream 
within a dreaml 

This was like climbing a steep 
hill with an intolerably heavy bur- 
den lashed to one’s aching back — 
like being forced to pull the dead 
weight of another body through a 
swamp which sucked one ever down. 
It was such an effort as she could 
not endure — 

Then that weight was gone, and 
the relief of its vanishing was such 
that Tamisan did not for a space 
more than just savor the fact that 
it did not drag at her. She opened 

123 



TOYS OF TAMISAN 




her eyes at last and even that small 
movement required an effort which 
left her spent. 

She was not in the sky tower. 
These walls were stone. And the 
light was dusky, coming wanly 
from a slit high in the opposite 
wall. The High Castle from which 
she had dreamed her way back to 
her own Ty-Kry, the dream within 
a dream. But how well had she 
wrought there? 

Tj'or the present, she was too 
-*• tired to even think connect- 
edly. Bits and pieces of all she had 
seen and done since she had awak- 
ened first in this Ty-Kry floated 
through her mind, not making any 
concrete pattern. 

It was the mind picture of Haw- 
arel’s face as she had seen it last 
while they marched toward the 
spacer which roused her from that 
uncaring drift — Hawarel and the 
threat the Captain had made and 
which the Over-Queen had pushed 
aside. If Tamisan had truly broken 
the lock Kas had set up to keep 
them here, then it would be escape 
— but now there was in her no 
strength. She tried to remember the 
formula for breaking, and knew a 
stroke of chilling fear when her 
memory proved faulty. She could 
not do it now — she must have 
more time to rest both mind and 
body. Now she was hungry, thirsty, 
with such a need for both food and 
drink that it was a torment. Did 



they mean to leave her here with- 
out any sustenance? 

Tamisan lay still, listening. And 
then she inched her head around 
slowly to view the deeper dusk of 
her surroundings at floor level. She 
was not alone! 

Kas! 

Had she been successful and 
pulled Kas with her? And if so — 
was it that he had no counterpart 
in this world as she and Starrex 
had found, so that he was still his 
old self? 

However, she did not have time 
to explore that possibility, for there 
was a loud grating, followed by a 
line of light marking an opening 
door. In the beam of a torch stood 
that same officer who had earlier 
been her escort. Using her hands 
to brace up her body, Tamisan 
raised herself. But at the same 
time there was a cry from the far 
corner. 

Someone moved there, raising a 
head and showing features she had 
last seen in the sky tower. Kas — 
and in his rightful body! He was 
scrambling to his feet. The officer 
and the guardsman behind him in 
the doorway, stared at the other- 
worlder as if they could not believe 
their eyes. Kas shook his head to 
clear away some mist and then — 

His lips pulled back from his 
teeth in a terrible rictus which was 
no smile. There was a small laser 
in his hand. She could not move; 
he was going to bum her! In that 

IE 



124 




moment she was so sure of it that 
she did not even know fear, only 
waited for the crisping of her flesh. 

T)ut the aim of that weapon 
raised beyond her and fasten- 
ed on the doorway. Under it, both 
officer and guard went down. With 
one hand on the wall to steady him- 
self, Kas pulled along until he came 
to her. He stood away from the 
stone then, transferred his laser to 
the other hand and reached down 
to hook fingers in the robe where 
it covered her shoulder. 

“On — your — feet.” He mouth- 
ed the words with difficulty, as if 
his exhaustion nearly equalled hers. 
“I do not know how — or why — 
or who — ” 

The torch dropped from the 
charred hand which had carried it 
to give them much curtailed light. 
But Kas swung her around, thrust- 
ing his face very close to hers. He 
stared at her intently, as if by the 
very force of his glare he could 
strip aside the mask this other 
world body made for her, force the 
old Tamisan into sight. 

“You are Tamisan — it can not 
be otherwise! I do not know how 
you did this, demon-bom.” He 
shook her with a viciousness which 
struck her painfully against the 
wall. “Where — is — he?” 

All that came from her parched 
throat were harsh sounds without 
meaning. 

“Never mind.” Kas stood 
TOYS OF TAMISAN 



straighter now and there was more 
vigor in his voice. “Where he is 
— there shall I find him. Nor shall 
I lose you, demon-born, since you 
are my way back. And for Lord 
Starrex here there will be no guards, 
no safe shields. Perhaps this is the 
better way after all!” He slapped 
her face, his palm bruising her 
flesh, once more thumping her head 
back against the wall so that the 
rim of the Mouth crown bit into 
her scalp and she cried out in pain. 

“Speak! Where is this place. An- 
swer me.” 

“The High Castle of Ty-Kry,” 
she croaked out. 

“And what do you in this hole?” 

“I am prisoner to the Over- 
Queen.” 

“Prisoner? What do you mean? 
You are a dreamer, this is your 
dream. Why are you a prisoner?” 

Tamisan was so shaken she could 
not marshal words easily as she had 
done to explain to Starrex. And she 
thought, a little dazedly, that Kas 
might not accept her explanation 
anyway. 

“Not — wholly — a dream,” she 
got out. 

He did not seem surprised. “So 
the control has that property, has 
it — to impose a sense of reality. 
Then — ” His eyes blazed into 
hers. “You can not control this 
dream, is that it? Again fortune 
favors me, it seems. Where is Star- 
rex now?” 

She could give him a truthful 

125 




answer and she was glad of that. 
As it seemed to her now, she could 
not speak falsely with any hope of 
belief. It was as if he could see 
straight into her mind with those 
demanding eyes of his. “I do not 
know.” 

“But he is in this dream — 
somewhere?” 

“Yes.” 

“Then you shall find him for 
me, Tamisan. And speedily. Do we 
have to search this High Castle?” 
“He was, when I saw him last, 
outside.” 

S he kept her eyes turned from 
the door, from what lay there. 
But now he hauled her toward that 
and she was afraid she was going 
to be sick. Where they might be in 
the interior of the small city which 
was the High Castle, she did not 
know. Except that those who had 
brought her here had not taken her 
on to the core towers, but had 
turned aside along the first of the 
gateways and gone down a long 
flight of stairs. She doubted if they 
would be able to walk out again as 
easily as Kas thought to do. 

“Come.” He pulled at her, drag- 
ging her on, kicking aside what lay 
in the door. She closed her eyes 
tightly as he brought her past. But 
the stench of death was so strong 
that she staggered, retching, with 
his hand ever dragging at her, keep- 
ing on her feet and reeling ahead. 

Twice she watched glassily as he 
126 



burned down opposition. And his 
luck at keeping surprise on his side 
held. They came to the foot of the 
stairs and climbed. Tamisan held 
to one hope — now that she was on 
her feet and moving she found a 
measure of strength returning, so 
that she no longer feared falling, 
if Kas released his hold upon her. 
When they were out at last in the 
night, with the damp smell of the 
underways wafted away by a ris- 
ing wind, she felt clean and re- 
newed and was able to think. 

Kas might have been able to get 
her this far because of her weak- 
ness. So to his eyes she must con- 
tinue to counterfeit that, until she 
had a chance to act. It could be 
that his weapon, so alien to this 
world and thus so effective, might 
well cut their way to Starrex. But 
that did not mean that once they 
had reached him she need obey 
Kas. And somehow she also felt 
that face to face Kas would be less 
confident of success. 

It was not a guard that halted 
them now but a massive gate, such 
a barrier as was meant to hold. Kas 
examined the bar and laughed, be- 
fore he raised the laser and sent 
a needle-thin beam to cut as he 
needed. There was a shout from 
above and Kas, almost lanquidly, 
swung the beam to a narrow stair 
leading from the ramparts, laugh- 
ing again as there came a choked 
scream land the sound of a falling 
body. 



IF 




“Now!” Kas put his shoulder to 
the gate and it swung, more easily 
than Tamisan would have thought 
possible for its weight. “Where is 
Starrex? And if you lie — ” His 
smile was a very evil one. 

‘“There.” Tamisan was sure of 
her direction and she pointed to 
where there was a distant blaze of 
torches about the shadow bulk of 
the grounded spacer. 

xin 

U A spacer I” Kas paused. 

“Besieged by these people,” 
Tamisan informed him. “And Star- 
rex is a hostage on board, if he still 
lives. They have threatened to use 
him in some manner as a weapon 
and the Over-Queen, as far as I 
know, does not care.” 

Kas turned on her. His evil 
merriment had vanished, his smile 
was rather now a snarl, and he 
shook her back and forth. “It is 
your dream — control it!” 

For a moment, Tamisan hesitat- 
ed. Should she try to tell him what 
she believed the truth? Kas and 
his other world weapon might be 
her only hope of reaching Starrex 
now. Could he be persuaded to a 
frontal attack if he thought that 
was their only chance of reaching 
their goal? On the other hand, if 
she admitted she could not break 
this dream, he might well bum her 
down out of hand and take his 
chances. 



“Your meddling has warped the 
pattern, Lord Kas. I can not con- 
trol some elements. Nor can I break 
the dream until I have Lord Star- 
rex with me — since. we are pattern- 
linked in this sequence.” 

Her steady reply seemed to have 
some effect on him. Though he gave 
her one more punishing shake and 
uttered an obscenity, he looked on 
to the torches and the half-seen 
bulk of the ship, a certain calcula- 
tion in his eyes. 

They made a length ly detour, 
away from most of the torches, 
coming up across the open land to 
the south of the ship. There was a 
graying in the sky and a hint that 
dawn might perhaps be not too far 
away. Now that they could see bet- 
ter, it was apparent that the ship 
was sealed. No hatch opened on its 
surface, no ramp ran out. And sure- 
ly the laser in Kas’s hand was not 
going to bum their way in, in the 
manner he had opened the gate of 
the High Castle. 

Apparently the same difficulty 
presented itself to Kas, for he 
halted her with a jerk while they 
were still in the shadows well away 
from the line of torches forming a 
square around the ship. They 
sheltered in a small dip in the 
ground surveying the scene. 

The torches were no longer 
held by men, but had been planted 
in the ground at regular intervals, 
and they were as large as outsize 
candles. The colorful mass which 



TOYS OF TAMISAN 



127 




had marked the Over-Queen and her 
courtiers on Tamisan’s first visit to 
the landing field was gone, leaving 
only a perimeter line of guards- 
men in wide encirclement of the 
sealed ship. 

Why did the spacemen just not 
lift and planet elsewhere? Unless 
that confusion in the last moments 
when she had been on board the 
spacer meant that they could not 
do so. They had spoken then of a 
sister ship in orbit above. It would 
seem that it had made no move to 
aid them, though she had no idea 
how much time had elapsed since 
last she had been here. 

^Tow Kas turned on her again. 

* “Can you get to Starrex — 
reach him a message?” he de- 
manded. 

“I can try. For what reason?” 

“Have him ask for us to come 
to him.” Kas had been silent for 
a moment before replying. Was he 
so stupid as to believe that she 
would not give a warning with 
whatever message she could so de- 
liver? Or had he precautions 
against that? 

But could she reach Starrex? She 
had gone into the secondary dream 
to make contact with Kas. There 
was no time nor preparation for 
such a move now. She could only 
use the mental technique for in- 
ducing a dream and see what hap- 
pened thereby. She said as much to 
Kas now, promising no success. 
128 



“Be about what you can do — 
nowl” he told her roughly. 

Tamison closed her eyes to 
think of Hawarel as she had seen 
him last, standing beside her on this 
very field. And she heard a gasp 
from Kas. Opening her eyes she 
saw Hawarel, even as he had been 
then — or rather a palid copy of 
him, wavering and instinct, already 
beginning to fade, so she spoke 
in a swift gabble: 

“Say we come from the Queen 
with a message, that we must see 
the Captain — ” 

The shimmering outline of Haw- 
arel faded into the night. She 
heard Kas mutter angrily “What 
good will that ghost do?” 

“I can not tell. If he returns to 
that of which he is a part, he can 
carry the message. For the rest — ” 
Tamisan shrugged. “I have told you 
this is no dream I can control. Do 
you think if it were, we two would 
stand here in this fashion?” 

His thin lip parted in one of his 
mirthless grins. 

“You would not, I know, dream- 
er 1” 

His head went from left to right 
as he slowly surveyed the line of 
planted torches and the men stand- 
ing on guard between them. “Do 
we move closer to this ship, expect 
them to open to us?” 

“They used a stunner to take us 
before,” Tamisan saw fit to warn 
him. “They might do so again.” 
“Stunner,” he gestured with the 

IF 




laser. Tamisan hoped his answer 
would not be a headlong attack on 
the ship with that. 

But instead, he used it as a 
pointer to motion her on toward the 
touch line. “If they do open up,” 
he commented, “I shall be warned” 




by rough handling, frayed in strips 
at the hem where she could be 
tripped if she caught those rags be- 
tween her feet. And the rough brush 
growing knee-high about them 
caught at it so that she stumbled 
now and again, urged on continual- 
ly by Kas’s pulling when he dug his 
fingers painfully into her already 
bruised shoulder. 

So they reached the torch line. 
The guards there faced inward to 
the ship and in this increase of light 
Tamisan could see that they were 
all bowmen, arqied with crossbows, 
not with those of bone which the 
black-tunicked men had earlier 
used. Bolts against the might of the 
ship I The answer seemed laughable, 
a jest to delight the simple. Yet, 
the ship lay there and Tamisan 
could well remember the conster- 
nation of those men who had been 
questioning her within it. 

Now — 

There was a dark spot on the hull 
of the ship and a hatch suddenly 
swung open! A battle hatch — 
though she had only seen those via 
tape study. 

TOYS OF TAMISAN 



“Kas — they are going to fire!” 
With a laser beam from such, they 
could crisp everything on this field, 
perhaps dear back to the walls of 
the High Castle! 

She tried to turn in his grasp, 
to race back and away, knowing 
already that such a race was lost 
before she took the first lunging 
stride. But he held her fast. 

“No muzzle,” he said. 

Tamisan strained to see through 
the poor, flickering light. Perhaps 
it was a lightening of the sky which 
did make dear that there was no 
muzzle projecting to spew a fiery 
death across them all. But that was 
surely a gun port. 

As quickly as it had appeared, 
that opening was dosed. The ship 
was again sealed tightly. 
“What—?” 

“Either they can not use it,” Kas 
answered her half question, “or 
they have thought better of doing 
so. Which means, by either count, 
we have a chance. Now — stay you 
here! Or else I shall come looking 
for you in a manner you shall not 
relish, and never believe that I can 
not find you!” Nor did something 
in Tamisan dispute that. 

She stood. After all, apart from 
Kas’s threats, where did she have 
to go? If she were sighted by any 
of the guards, she might either be 
returned to prison or dealt with 
summarily in another fashion. And 
she had to reach Starrex if she were 
to escape. 



129 




But she watched Kas make good 
use of the interest which riveted 
the eyes of the guards on the ship. 
He crept, with more ease than she 
thought possible for one used to 
the luxury living of the sky towers, 
behind the nearest man. 

TX7hat weapon he used she could 
* * not see; it was not the laser. 
Instead he straightened to his full 
height behind the unsuspecting 
guard, reached out an arm and 
seemed only to touch the stranger 
on the neck. Immediately the fel- 
low collapsed without a sound, 
though Kas caught him before he 
had fallen to the ground and 
dragged him backward to the slight 
depression in the field where Tami- 
san waited. 

“Quick!” Kas ordered. “Give me 
his cloak and helm!” 

He ripped off his own tunic with 
its extravagantly padded shoulders, 
while Tamisan knelt to fumble with 
a great brooch, freeing the envelop- 
ing cloak of the guard. Kas snatch- 
ed it out of her hands, dragged the 
rest of it loose from under the limp 
body and pulled it around him, 
taking up the helm and settling it 
on his head with a tap. Then he 
took up the crossbow. 

“Walk before me,” he told Tami- 
san. “If they have a field scanner 
on in the ship, I want them to see 
a prisoner under guard. That may 
bring them to a parlay. It is a thin 
chance, but our best — 9j 
130 



He could not guess that it might 
be a better chance than he hoped, 
Tamisan knew, since he did not 
know that she had been once with- 
in the ship and the crew might be 
expecting some such return with a 
message from the Over-Queen. But 
to walk out boldly, past the line of 
torches — surely Kas’s luck would 
not hold so well; they would be 
seen by the other guards before they 
were a quarter of the way to the 
ship. But she had not any other 
proposal to offer in exchange. 

This was no adventure such as 
she had lived through in dreams. 
She believed that if she died now, 
she died indeed and would not wake 
unharmed in her own world. And 
her flesh crawled with a fear which 
made her mouth go dry and her 
hands quiver as they held wet and 
tight upon the folds of her robe. 
Any second now — she would feel 
the impact of a bolt — hear a shout 
of discovery — be — 

But still Tamisan tottered for- 
ward and heard, with danger-alert- 
ed ears, the faint crunch of boots 
which was Kas behind. His con- 
tempt for a danger which was only 
too real for her made her wonder, 
fleetingly, if he did indeed still be- 
lieve this a dream she could con- 
trol, and need not then watch for 
any one but her. But she could not 
summon words to impress on him 
his woeful mistake. 

So intent was she upon some 
attack from behind that she was 

IF 




not really conscious of the ship to- 
wards which they went. Until, sud- 
denly she saw another of those 
ports open and steeled herself to 
feel the numbing charge of a 
stunner. 

However, again an attack she 
feared did not come. The sky was 
growing lighter even if there was 
no sign of sunrise. Instead the first 
drops of a storm began to fall. And 
under that onslaught of moisture 
from lowering clouds, the torches 
hissed and sputtered, finally flick- 
ering out, so that the gloom was 
hardly better than twilight. 

XIV 

'nphey came close enough to the 
ship to board, were one of 
the ramps lowered to them. There 
they stood waiting, while Tamisan 
felt the rise of almost hysterical 
laughter inside her. What an anti- 
climax if the ship refused to ac- 
knowledge them! They could not 
stand here forever and there was no 
chance they could battle a way in- 
side. Kas’s faith in her communi- 
cation with that ghost of Hawarel 
had been too high. 

But even as she was sure that 
they made an absurd failure, there 
was a sigh of sound from well above 
them. The port hatch wheeled back 
into the envelope of the ship’s wall, 
and a small ramp, hardly more 
than a steep ladder, swung creak- 
ing out and dropped to hit the 
TOYS OF TAMISAN 



charred ground not far from them. 

“Go!” Kas prodded her forward. 

With a shrug, Tamisan went. 
She found it hard to climb with 
the heavy, frayed skirts dragging 
her back. But by using her hands 
to pull along the single rail of the 
ramp, she made progress. Why had 
not the rest of the guards along 
that watching line of torches 
moved? Had it been that Kas’s 
half disguise had indeed deceived 
them, and they thought that Tami- 
san had been sent under orders to 
parlay a second time with the ship’s 
people? 

She was nearly at the hatch now 
and could see the suited men in 
the shadows above waiting. They 
had tanglers ready to fire, prepared 
to spin the webs to enmesh them 
both as easily handled prisoners. 
But before those slimy strands 
spun forth to touch — patterned 
as they were to seek flesh to an- 
chor — both the waiting space men 
jerked right and left, clutched with 
already dead hands at the breasts 
of charred tunics from which arose 
small, deadly spirals of smoke. 

They had expected a guard 
armed with a bow; they had met 
Kas’s laser, to the same undoing 
as the guardsmen at the castle. 
Kas’s shoulder in the middle of her 
back sent her sprawling, to land 
half over the bodies of the two who 
had awaited them. 

She heard a scuffle and was 
kicked and rolled aside, fighting 

131 




the folds of her own long skirt, try- 
ing to get out of the confines of the 
hatch pocket. Somehow, on her 
hands and knees, she made it for- 
ward, since she could not retreat. 
Now she fetched up against the 
wall of a corridor and managed to 
pull around to face the end of the 
fight 

The two guards lay dead. But 
Kas held the laser on a third man. 
Now, without glancing around, he 
gave an order which she mechani- 
cally obeyed. 

“The tangler — here!" 

Otill on her hands and knees, 
^ Tamisan crawled far enough 
back into the hatch compartment 
to grip one of those weapons. The 
second — she eyed it with awaken- 
ing need for some protection her- 
self, but Kas did not give her time 
to reach it. 

“Give it to me — now!" 

Still holding the laser pointed 
steadily at the middle of the third 
spaceman, he groped back with his 
other hands. She had no choice — 
no choice — but she did! 

If Kas thought he had her thor- 
oughly cowed — Swinging the 
tangler around without taking time 
to aim, Tamisan pressed^ the firing 
button. 

The lash of the sticky weaving 
spun through the air, striking the 
wall from which it dropped away, 
then one arm of the motionless 
captive, who was still under Kas’s 

132 



threat; there it clung, across his 
middle. And then it spun through 
the air until it clasped Kas’s gun 
hand, his middle, his other arm, 
adhering instantly, tightening with 
its usual efficiency and tying cap- 
tor to captive. 

Kas struggled against those ever- 
tightening bands to bring the laser 
around to beam on Tamisan, though 
whether he would have used it even 
in his white hot rage, she did not 
know. It was enough that the tang- 
ler made it so she could keep from 
his line of fire. Having ensnared 
them enough to render them both 
harmless for a time, Tamisan drew 
a deep breath and relaxed some- 
what. 

She had to be sure of Kas. She 
had loosed the firing button of the 
tangler as soon as she saw that he 
could not use his arms. Now she 
raised the weapon, and with more 
of a plan, tied his legs firmly to r 
gether. He kept on his feet, but he 
was as helpless as if they had man- 
aged to turn a stunner beam on 
him. 

Warily, she approached him. And 
guessing her intent, he went into 
wild wrigglings, trying to bring the 
adhesive tangler strands in contact 
with her flesh also. But she stooped 
and tore at the already fringed and 
frayed hem of her robe, ripping up 
a li strip as high as her waist, wind- 
ing this about her arm and wrist 
to make sure she could not be so 
entrapped. 



IF 




In spite of his struggles, she man- 
aged to get the laser out of his 
hold, and for the second time knew 
a surge of great relief. He made 
no sound, but his eyes were wild 
and his lips so tightly drawn against 
his teeth, his mouth slightly open, 
that a small trickle of spittle oozed 
from one corner to wet his chin. 
Looking at him dispassionately, 
Tamisaa thought him near in- 
sane at that moment. 

The spacecrewman was moving. 
He hitched along as she swung 
around with the laser as a warning, 
his shoulders against the wall keep- 
ing him firmly on his feet, his un- 
bound legs giving him more mo- 
bility, though the cord of the tang- 
ler anchored him to Kas. Tamisan 
glanced around, searching for what 
he appeared so desperate to reach. 
There was a com box. 

“Stand where you are I For now 
— ” she ordered. 

The threat of the laser kept him 
frozen. With that still trained on 
him, she darted short glances over 
her shoulder to the hatch opening. 
Sliding along the wall in turn, the 
tangler thrust loosely into the front 
of her belt, she managed with one 
arm to slam the hatch door and 
give a turn to its locking wheel. 

N ow — Using the laser as a 
pointer she motioned the 
crewman to the com, but the im- 
mobile Kas was too much of an 
anchor. Dared she free the crew- 
134 



man by even so much? There was 
no other way. She motioned with 
one hand. 

“Stand well away.” 

He had said nothing during 
their encounter, but he obeyed 
with an agility which suggested he 
liked the sight of that weapon in 
her hand even less than he had 
liked it when Kas had held it. He 
stretched to the limit the cord 
would allow so she was able to 
burn it through. 

Kas spit out a series of obsceni- 
ties which were only a meaningless 
noise as far as Tamisan was con- 
cerned. Until he was released, he 
was no more now than a well an- 
chored bundle — helpless. But the 
crewman had importance. 

She gestured him on to the com, 
reaching it before him. Now she 
played the best piece she had in 
this desperate game. 

“Where is Hawarel? The native 
who was brought on board?” 

He could lie, of course, and she 
would not know it. But it seemed 
he was willing to answer, probably 
because he thought that the truth 
would strike her worse than any 
lie. 

“They have him in the lab — 
conditioning him.” And he grinned 
at her with some of the evil malig- 
nancy she had seen in Kas. 

She remembered the Captain’s 
earlier threat to make of Hawarel 
a tool to use against the Over- 
Queen and her forces. Was she too 

IF 




late? But there was only one road 
to take and that was the one she 
had chosen in those few moments 
when she had taken up the tangler 
and used it for herself. 

"You will call.” She spoke as she 
might to one finding it difficult to 
understand her. "And you will say 
that Hawarel will be released, 
brought here — now!” 

"Why?” the crewman returned 
with visible insolence. "What will 
you do? Kill me? Perhaps, but 
that will not defeat the Captain’s 
plans. He will be willing to see 
half the crew burned — ” 

"That may be true.” She 
nodded. Not knowing the Captain, 
she could not tell whether or not 
that was a bluff. "But will his sac- 
rifice then save his ship?” 

"What can you do?” began the 
crewman and then he paused. His 
grin was gone; now he looked at 
her speculatively In her present 
guise she perhaps did not look for- 
midable enough to threaten the 
ship, but he could not be sure. And 
one thing she knew from her own 
time and place — a spaceman 
learned early to take nothing for 
granted on a new planet. It might 
well be that she did have command 
over some unknown force. 

"What can I do? There is much.” 
She took quick advantage of that 
hesitation "Have you been able to 
raise the ship?” She plunged on, 
hoping very desperately that she 
had made the right guess. "Have 
TOYS OF TAMISAN 



you been able to communicate wiffi 
your other ship, or ships, in or- 
bit?” 

His expression was her answer, 
one which fanned her hope into a 
bright blaze of excitement. The 
ship was grounded, had some sort 
of a hold on it which they had not 
been able to- break! 

"The Captain won’t listen.” He 
was sullen now. 

"I think he will. Tell him that 
we got Hawarel — here — and 

himself — or else we shall truly 
show you what happened to that 
derelict across the field.” 

R as had fallen silent. He was 
watching her, not with quite 
the same wariness of the crewman, 
but with an emotion she was not 
able to read. Surprise? Or did it 
mask some sly thought of taking 
over her bluff, captive though he 
was? 

"Talk!” The need for hurry rode 
Tamisan now. By this time those 
above would wonder why their cap- 
tives had not been brought before 
them. Also, outside, the Over- 
Queen’s men would certainly have 
reported that Tamisan and a seem- 
ing guard had entered the ship. 
From both sides enemies might be 
closing in. 

"I can not set the com,” her 
prisoner answered. 

"Tell me then!” 

"The red button — ” 

But she thought she had seen a 

135 




slight shift in his eyes. Tamisan 
raised her hand, to press the green 
button instead. Without accusing 
him of the treachery she was sure 
he had tried, she said again, more 
fiercely: 

*TaIk!” 

“Sannard here.” He put his lip 
dose to the com. “They — they 
hare me. Rooso and Cambre are 
dead. They want the native.” 

“In good condition,” hissed Tam- 
isan, “and now!” 

“They want him now, in 
good condition,” Sannard repeated. 
“.They threaten the ship” 

There came no acknowledgement 
from the com in return. Had she 
indeed pressed the wrong button 
because she was overly suspicious? 
What was going to happen? Time 
— sfee could not wait on time! 

“Sannard — ” the voice from the 
com was metalic, without human 
inflection or tone. 

But Tamisan gave the crewman 
a gush which sent him sliding back 
along the wall until he bumped in- 
to Kas and the binds of both men 
immediately united to make them 
one struggling package. Tamisan 
spoke into the com. 

. “Captain, I do not play any 
game. Send me your prisoner or 
look upon that derelict you see and 
sajr to yourself that will be your 
shq». For this is so, as true as I 
stand here now, with your man as 
my captive. Also — send Hawarel 
alone, and pray to whatever im- 
130 



mortal powers you believe sit in 
judgment over your actions that 
he can so come! Time grows very 
short and there is that which will 
act if you do not, and to a purpose 
you shall not relish!” 

The crewman, whose legs were 
still free, was trying to kick away 
from Kas. But his struggles instead 
sent them both to the floor in a 
heaving tangle. Tamisan’s hand 
dropped to her side as she leaned 
against the wall, breathing heavily. 
With all her will she wanted to con- 
trol action as she did in a dream, 
but only fate did that now. 



'T'hough she sagged against the 
wall, Tamisan felt rigid, as 
if she were in a great encasement 
of su-steel. And, as time moved 
at so slow a pace as not to be 
measured normally, that prisoning 
hold on her body and spirit grew. 
The crewman and Kas had ceased 
their struggles. She could not see 
the crewman's face, but that which 
Kas turned to her had a queer, dis- 
torted look. As if before her eyes, 
though not through any skill of 
hers, he was indeed changing, tak- 
ing on the aspect of another man. 
Since her return to the sky tower 
in the second dream she had known 
he was to be feared. Now, in spite 
of the fact that his body was se- 
curely imprisoned, she found her- 
self edging away, as if by the very 

IF 




intentness of that hostile stare he 
could aim a weapon to bring her 
down. But he said nothing, lay as 
broodingly quiet and impassive as 
though he had foreknowledge of 
utter failure for her. 

She knew so little, Tamisaon 
thought, she who had always taken 
pride in her learning, in the wealth 
of lore she had drawn into furnish- 
ing her memory for action dream- 
ing. The spacecrew might have 
some way of flooding this short cor- 
ridor with a noxious gas, or using 
a hidden ray linked with a scanner 
to finish them. Tamisan found her- 
self running her hands along the 
walls, studying the unbroken sur- 
face a little wildly, striving to find 
where death might enter quietly and 
unseen. 

There was another bulkhead door 
at the end of this short corridor; at 
a few paces away from the outer 
hatch a ladder ascended to a closed 
trap. Her head turned constantly, 
until she regained a firmer control 
of herself, from one of those en- 
trances to the other. They had only 
to wait to call her bluff — only to 
wait. 

Yes! They had waited and they 
were — 

The air about her was changing, 
there was a growing scent in it. Not 
unpleasant — but even a fine per- 
fume would have seemed a stench 
from the dungheap when it reached 
her nostrils under these present 
conditions! Also the light which 
TOYS OF TAMISAN 



radiated from the jointure of the 
corridor roof and ceiling was alter- 
ing. It had been that of a moderate- 
ly sunlit day, now it was bluish. 
So under it her own brown skin 
took on an eerie look. She had lost 
her throw! Maybe, if she could 
open the hatch again, let in the out- 
er air — 

Tamisan tottered to the hatch, 
gripped the locking wheel and 
brought her strength to bear. Kas 
was writhing again, trying to break 
loose from his unwilling partner. 
But oddly enough the crewman lay 
limp, his head rolling when Kas’s 
heaving disturbed the lay of his 
body, but his eyes were closed. And, 
at the same time Tamisan braced 
against the wall, her full strength 
turned on the need for opening the 
door, she knew a flash of surprise. 
Was it her over-vivid imagination 
alone which made her believe that 
she was in danger? When she rested 
to draw a deep breath — 

XX7hy — in her startlement she 
* * could have cried out aloud. 
She did utter a small sound. She 
was gaining strength, not losing it. 
Every lungful of that scented air 
she breathed in — and she was 
breathing deeper, more slowly as if 
her body desired such nourishment 
— was a restorative. 

Kas, too? She turned to glance 
at him again. Where she breathed 
deeply, with lessening apprehen- 
sion, he was gasping, his face ghast- 

137 




Iy in the change of light. And then, 
even as she watched, his struggles 
ended, his head fell back so that he 
lay as inert as the crewman he 
sprawled across. 

So whatever change was in prog- 
ress here, it affected Kas and the 
crewman — that latter faster than 
the former — but not her. And now 
her trained imagination took an- 
other leap. Perhaps she had not 
been so far wrong in threatening 
those on this ship with danger. 
Though she had no guess as to 
how it was done, this could be an- 
other strange weapon in the arma- 
ment of the Over-Queen. 

Hawarel? The spacemen had 
probably never intended to send 
him. Dared she go to seek him? 
Tamisan wavered, one hand on the 
hatch wheel, looking to the ladder 
and the other door. If all within 
this ship save she had reacted to 
the strange air, there would be 
none to stop her. But if she fled 
the ship, she would face the loss of 
the keys to her own world — Star- 
rex and Kas. In addition, she 
might be met by some evil fate at 
the hands of the Over-Queen. She 
had broken prison, and — if they 
did not know of Kas — had left 
dead men behind her. As the 
Mouth of Olava, she shuddered 
from the judgment which would be 
rendered one deemed to have prac- 
ticed wrongful supernatural acts. 

Resolutely, Tamisan went to the 
door at the end of the corridor. It 
138 



was really true that she had no 
choice at all. She must find Starrex, 
somehow bring him here, so that 
they three could be together and 
win a small space of time in which 
to arrange a dream breaking — 
or she was totally defeated. 

She loosened her belt a little so 
she could draw up her robe through 
it, shortening the hampering length, 
leaving her legs freer. There was 
the tangler and Kas’s laser. In ad- 
dition was this mounting feeling of 
strength and well being, though an 
inner warning suggested she not 
trust to over-confidence. 

The door gave under her push 
and she looked out upon a scene 
which first startled and then re- 
assured her. There were crewmen 
in the corridor. But they lay prone 
as if they had been caught while 
on their way to the hatch. Lasers 
— of a slightly different pattern 
than that Kas had brought — had 
fallen from their hands, and three 
of the four wore tanglers. 

Hpamisan picked her way care- 
^ fully around them, gathering 
up all those weapons in a fold of 
her robe, as if she were some maiden 
in a field gathering an armload of 
spring flowers. The men were alive, 
she saw as she stooped closer, but 
they breathed evenly as if peace- 
fully asleep. 

She took one of the tanglers, dis- 
carding the one she had used, fear- 
ing its charge might be near ex- 

IF 




haustion. As for the rest of the col- 
lection, she dropped them at the 
far end of the passageway and 
turned the beam of Kas’s weapon 
on them; she left behind a metal 
mass of no use to anyone. 

Her idea of the geography of the 
ship was scanty. She would sim- 
ply have to explore and keep ex- 
ploring until she found Starrex. 
But she would start at the top and 
work down. So she found a level 
ladder, three times coming upon 
a sleeping crewman. Each time she 
made sure he was disarmed be- 
fore she left him. 

The blue shade of the light was 
growing deeper, giving a very weird 
cast to the faces of the sleepers. 
Making sure her robe was tightly 
kilted up, Tamisan began to climb. 
She had reached the third level 
when she heard the sound, the first 
she had noted in this too-silent 
ship since she had left the hatch- 
way. 

She stopped to listen, deciding 
it came from somewhere in the 
level into which she had just 
climbed. With laser in hand, she 
tried to use it as a guide, though 
it was misleading — and might 
have come from any one of the 
cabins. Each door she passed Tami- 
san pushed open. There were more 
sleepers — some stretched in bunks, 
others on the floors or seated at 
tables with their heads lying on 
those surfaces. But she did not halt 
now to collect weapons. The need 
TOYS OF TAMISAN 



to be about her task, free of this 
ship, built in her as sharp as might 
a slaver’s lash laid across her 
shrinking shoulders. 

Suddenly the sound grew louder 
as she came to a last door and 
pushed it. Now she looked into a 
cabin not meant for living but per- 
haps for a kind of death. Two men 
in plain tunics were crumpled by 
the threshold. As if they had had 
some limited warning of danger to 
come and had tried to flee, but fall- 
en before they could reach the cor- 
ridor. Behind them was a table and 
on that a body, very much alive, 
struggling with dogged determina- 
tion against confining straps. 

Though his long hair had been 
clipped and the stubble of it shaven 
to expose the full nakedness of his 
entire scalp, there was no mistaking 
Hawarel. He not only fought against 
the clamps and straps which held 
him to the table, but in addition 
he jerked his head with sharp, short 
pulls, to dislodge disks fastened to 
his forehead, and from there, by 
wire, to a vast box of a machine 
which filled one quarter of the cab- 
in. 

npamisan stepped over the inert 
men, reached the side of the 
table and jerked the disks away 
from the prisoner’s head; perhaps 
his determined struggles had already 
loosened them somewhat. His mouth 
had opened and shut as she came to 
him as if he were forming words 

139 




she could not hear, or he could not 
voice. But as the apparatus came 
away in her hands, he gave a cry 
of triumph. 

“Get me loose!” he commanded. 
She was already examining the un- 
der part of the table for the lock- 
ing mechanism of those straps and 
clamps. It was only seconds before 
she was able to obey his order. 

He sat upright, bare to the waist, 
and she saw beneath, where his 
shoulders and the upper part of 
his spine had rested on the table, a 
complicated series of disks. 

“Ah!” Before she could move he 
scooped up the laser she had laid 
on the edge of the table when she 
had freed him. And the gesture he 
made with it might not have been 
only to indicate the door and the 
need for hurry, but perhaps also 
was a warning that with a weapon 
in his hands he now thought he 
was in command of the situation. 

“They sleep — everywhere.” she 
told him. “And Kas — he is a 
prisoner.” 

“I thought you could not find 
him — he was not one of the crew.” 

“He was not. But I have him 
now, and with him we can return.” 

“How long will it take?” Starrex 
was down on one knee, searching 
the two men on the floor. 

“I can not tell.” She gave him 
the truth. “But — how long will 
these sleep? Their unconsciousness 
is, I think, some trick of the 
Over-Queen’s.” 

140 



“It came unexpectedly for them,” 
Starrex agreed. “And you may be 
right that this is only preliminary 
to taking over the ship. I have 
learned this much, that their in- 
struments and much of their equip- 
ment has been affected so they can 
not trust them. Otherwise — ” His 
Hawarel face was grim under its 
bluish, deadman’s coloring. “Other- 
wise I would not have survived this 
long as myself.” 

“Let us go!” Now that she had 
miraculously — or so it seemed to 
her — succeeded, Tamisan was even 
more uneasy, wanting nothing to 
spoil their escape. 

XVI 

'T'hey found their way back to 
the corridor before the hatch 
while the ship still slept. Starrex 
knelt by Kas and then looked with 
astonishment at Tamisan. “But this 
is the real Kas! ” 

“It is Kas, real enough,” she 
agreed. “And there is a reason for 
that. But need we discuss it now? 
If the Over-Queen’s men come to 
take this ship — I tell you her 
greeting to us may be worse than 
any you have met here. I remem- 
ber enough of the Tamisan who is 
the Mouth of Olava to know that.” 
He nodded. “Can you break 
dream now?” 

She looked around her a little 
wildly. Concentration — no, some- 
how she could not think so clearly. 

IF 




It was as if the exultation of fumes 
of that scented air had awakened 
in her was draining. And with that 
sapping went what she needed 
most. 

“I — I fear not.” 

“It is simple then.” He stopped 
again to examine the tangle cords. 
“We shall have to go to where you 
can.” She saw him set the laser on 
its lowest beam to bum through 
the cords which united Kas to the 
crewman, though he did not free 
his cousin from the rest of his 
bonds. 

But what if they marched out of 
the hatch into a waiting party of the 
Over-Queen’s guards? They had the 
tangler, the laser, and perhaps — 
just perhaps — the half smile of 
fortune on their side. They would 
have to risk it 

Tamisan opened the inner door 
of the pressure chamber. The dead 
men lay there as they had fallen. 
Fighting nausea, she dragged one 
aside to make room for Star rex, 
who carried Kas over his shoulder, 
moving slowly under that burden, 
a fo.ld of cloak well wrapped about 
the prisoner to prevent any con- 
tact between the cords and Star- 
rex’s own flesh. The outer hatch 
was open and beyond — 

A blast of icy rain, with the 
added bite of the wind which drove 
it, struck viciously at them. It had 
been dawn when Tamisan had en- 
tered the ship, but outside now the 
day was no lighter. The torches had 
TOYS OF TAMISAN 



been extinguished. Tamisan could 
see no lights. Shielding her eyes 
against the wind and the rain, she 
tried to make out the line of 
guards. 

Perhaps the severe weather had 
driven them all away. She was sure 
no one was waiting at the foot of 
the ramp, unless they were under 
the fins of the ship, sheltering 
there. And that chance would have 
to be taken. She said as much and 
Starrex nodded. 

“Where do we go?” 

“Anywhere away from the city. 
Give me but a little shelter and 
time.” 

“Vernier’s Hand over us and we 
can do it,” he returned. “Here — 
take this!” 

He kicked an object across the 
metal plates of the deck and she 
saw it was one of the lasers used 
by the crewmen. She picked it up 
in one hand, the tangler in her 
other. Burdened as he was by Kas, 
Starrex could not lead the way. 
She must now play in real life such 
an action role as she had many 
times dreamed. But this held no 
amusement, only a wish to scuttle 
quickly into any form of safety 
wind and rain would allow her. 

The ramp being at such a steep 
angle, she feared slipping on it and 
had to belt the tangler, hold on 
grimly with one hand and go much 
more slowly than her fast beating 
heart demanded, anxious lest Star- 
rex in turn might lose footing and 



141 




slam into her, carrying them both 
on to disaster. 

The strength of the storm was 
such that it was a battle to gain 
step after step, even though she 
reached the ground without mishap. 
Tamisan was not sure in which 
direction she must head now to 
avoid the Castle and the city. Her 
memory seemed befuddled by the 
storm and she could only guess. Al- 
so she was afraid of losing contact 
with Starrex; as slowly as she went, 
he dragged even more behind. 

Then she stumbled against an 
upright stakje. She put out her hand 
and fumbled along it enough to 
know that this was one of the rain 
quenched torches. It heartened her 
a little to learn that they had 
reached the barrier and that no 
guards stood here. Perhaps the 
storm was a life saver for the three 
of them. 

Tamisan lingered, waiting for 
Starrex to catch up. Now he caught 
at the torch, steadying himself as 
if he needed that support. 

His voice came in wind-deadened 
gusts, labored. “I may have in this 
Hawarel a good body, but I am 
not a heavy duty android. We must 
find your shelter.” 

There was a dark shadow to her 
left; it could be a coppice. Even 
trees or tall brush could give them 
some measure of relief. 

“Over there.” She pointed, but 
did not know if, in this gloom, he 
could see it. 



“Yes.” He straightened a little 
under the burden of Kas, stagger- 
ing in the direction of the shadow. 

They had to beat their way into 
the vegetation. Tamisan, having 
two arms free, broke the path for 
Starrex. She might have used the 
laser to cut, but the ever-present 
fear that they might need the 
charges for future protection kept 
her from a waste of their slender 
resources for defense. 

At last, at the cost of branch- 
whipped and thorn-ripped weals in 
their flesh, they came into a space 
which was a little more open. Star- 
rex allowed his burden to fall to 
the ground. 

“Can you break dream now?” He 
squatted down beside Kas, as she 
dropped to sit panting near him. 

“I can — ” 

But she got no farther. There was 
a sound which cut through even 
the tumult of the storm, and that 
part of them which was allied to 
this world knew it for what it was, 
the warning of a hunt. And — since 
they were able to hear it — they 
must be the hunted 1 

“The Itter Hounds!” He put 
their peril into words. 

“And they run for us!” . Mouth 
of Olava or not, when the Itter 
Hounds coursed on one’s track there 
was no defense, for they could not 
be controlled once they were loosed 
to chase. 

“We can not fight them.” 

“Do not be too sure of that,” he 

IF 



142 




answered. “We have the lasers, 
weapons not of this world. The 
weapon which put the ship’s crew 
to sleep did not vanquish us; so 
might an off-world weapon react 
the other way here — ” 

“But Kas — ” She thought she 
had found a weak point in his 
reasoning, much as die wanted to 
believe he had guessed rightly. 

“Kas is in his own form, which 
is perhaps more akin to the crew- 
men now than to us. And, by the 
way, how is it that he is?” 

She kept hej tale terse, but told 
him of her dream within a dream 
and how she had found Kas. She 
heard him laugh. 

“I was right then in thinking my 
dear cousin might well be at the 
center of this web! However, now 
he is as completely enmeshed as the 
rest of us. As a fellow victim he 
may be more cooperative.” 
“Entirely so, my noble lord!” 
The voice out of the dark between 
them was composed. 

“You are awake then, cousin. 
Well, we would be even more awake. 
There is a struggle here in pro- 
gress between two sets of enemies 
who are both willing to make us a 
third. We had better travel swiftly 
elsewhere if we would save our 
skins. What of it, Tamisan?” 

“I must have time.” 

“What I can do to buy it for 
you, I will!” That carried the force 
of a sworn oath. “If the lasers act 
outside the laws of this world, it 
TOYS OF TAMISAN 



may be that they can even stop the 
Itter Hounds. But to get to it! ” 
She had no proper conductor, 
nothing but her will and the need. 
Putting out her hands she touched 
the bare, wet flesh of Starrex’s 
shoulder, was more cautious in 
seeking a hold on Kas, lest she en- 
counter one of the tangle cords. 
Then she exerted her full will and 
looked far in, not out. 

It was no use, her craft failed 
her. There was that momentary sen- 
sation of suspension between two 
worlds. Then she was back in the 
dark brush where the growing walls 
did not hold off the rain. 

“I can not break the dream. 
There is no energy machine to step 
up the power.” But she did not add 
that perhaps she might have done 
it for herself alone. 

Kas laughed then. “It would 
seem my sealer still works in spite 
of all your meddling, Tamisan. I 
fear, my noble lord, you will have 
to prove the effectiveness of your 
weapons after all. Though you 
might set me free and give me arms, 
necessity making allies of us after 
all.” 

“Tamisan!” Starrex’s voice was 
one to bring her out of the dull 
anguish of her failure. “This dream 
— remember, it may not be a usual 
dream after all. Could another 
world door be opened?” 

“Which world?” At that moment 
her memories of reading and view- 
ing tapes were a whirl in her head. 

143 




And the voiceless call of the Itter 
Hounds to which this Tamisan was 
attuned made her whole body cringe 
and shiver, addled her thinking 
even more. 

“ Which world? Any one — think, 
girl, think! Take a single change if 
you must, but think!” 

“I can not. The Hounds — aheee 
— they come — they come! We 
are meat for the fangs of those who 
course the Dark Runnels under 
moonless skies! We are lost!” The 
Tamisan who dreamed slipped into 
the Mouth of Olava, and the Mouth 
of Olava vanished in turn, and she 
was only a naked, defenseless thing 
crouching under the shadow of a 
death against which she could raise 
no shield. She was — 

Her head rocked, the flesh of 
her cheeks stung as she swayed 
from the slaps dealt her by Star- 
rex. 

“You are a dreamer!” His voice 
was imperative. “Dream now then 
as you have never dreamed before! 
For there is that in you which can 
do this, if you will it.” 

It was like the action of that 
strange scented air in the ship; her 
will was reborn, her mind steadied. 
Tamisan the dreamer pushed out 
that other weak Tamisan. But — 
what world? A point — give her but 
a decision point in history! 

“ Yaaaah — ” the cry from Star- 
rex’s throat was not now meant to 
prouse her. Perhaps it was the bat- 
tle challenge of Hawarel. 

144 



There was a pallid snout, about 
which hung a dreadful sickening 
phosphorescence, thrust through the 
screen of brush. She sensed rather 
than saw Starrex fire the laser at 
it. 

A decision — Water beating in 
on her. Wind rising as if to claw 
them out of the poor refuge to be 
easy meat for the hunters. Drown- 
ing — sea — sea — the Sea Kings 
of Nath! 

Feverishly she seized upon that. 
But she knew so little of the Sea 
Kings who had once held the lace 
of islands east of Ty-Kry. They 
had threatened Ty-Kry itself — so 
long ago that that war was legend, 
not true history. And they had been 
tricked, their kind and his war 
chiefs taken by treachery. 

The 111 Cup of Nath. Tamisan 
forced herself to remember, to 
hold on that. And, with her choice 
made, again her mind steadied. She 
threw out her hands, once more 
touching Starrex and Kas, though 
she did not choose the latter; her 
hand went without her conscious 
bidding as if he must be included 
or all would fail. 

The 111 Cup of Nath — this time 
it would not be drunk! 

'T'amisan opened her eyes. Tami- 
san — no — she was Tami-sinl 
She sat up and looked about her. Soft 
covering of pale green fell away 
from her bare body. And, inspect- 
ing that same body, she saw that 

IF 




her skin was no longer warmly 
brown but w as instead a pearl 
white. What she sat within was a 
bed place fashioned in the form of 
a great shell, the other half of it 
arching over head to form a canopy. 

Also — she was not alone. Cau- 
tiously, she turned a little to survey 
her sleeping companion. His head 
was somewhat hidden from her so 
that she could see only a curve of 
shoulder as pale as her own, hair 
curled in a tight fitting cap, the 
red-brown shade of storm tossed 
sea-weed. 

Warily, very warily, she put out 
a finger tip, touched it to his 
hunched shoulder — and knew! He 
sighed, began to roll over toward 
her. Tamisan smiled and clasped 
her arms under her small, high 
breasts. 

She was Tam-sin, and this was 
Kilwar, who had been Starrex and 
Hawarel — but was now Lord of 
LockNer of the Nearer Sea. But, 



there had been a third! Her smile 
faded as memory sharpened. Kasl 
Anxiously she looked about the 
room, its nacre-coated walls, its 
pale green hangings, all familiar 
to Tam-sin. 

No Kas. Which did not mean 
that he might not be lurking some- 
where about, a disruptive factor 
if his nature held true. 

A warm arm swung up about her 
waist. Startled she looked down in- 
to green eyes, sea-green eyes, eyes 
which knew her — and which also 
knew that other Tamisan. Below 
those very knowledgeable eyes lips 
smiled. 

“I think,” his voice was familiar 
and yet strange, “that this is going 
to be a very interesting dream, my 
Tam-sin.” 

She allowed herself to be drawn 
down beside him. Perhaps — no, 
surely — he was right.

An Interview 
with 

Lester del Rey 



Lester del Rey, Ij’s Managing 
Editor and author of a score of 
science-fiction books ( not to men- 
tion an equal number of non-sf ti- 
tles), has been writing science fic- 
ion since before some present 
writers were born. We found a good 
opportunity to start him talking, so 
we turned on the tape recorder and 
let it run — and the following is 
the result. 

I got interested in science fiction 
as soon as I could read ... or a lit- 
tle bit before. I had Jules Verne 
read to me before I could read. As 
soon as I’d learned how, we had a 
pretty good collection of his stuff 
and I read it all. I read Wells, from 
the library, Burroughs when I 
could get them. As a matter of fact, 
the first hard-cover book I ever 
sent away for and bought — I spent 
good money for it, forty-nine cents, 
I’d have you know, in the Grosset 
& Dunlap edition — was Bur- 
roughs. Sooner or later somebody 




gave me a copy of a science-fic- 
tion magazine, but I never saw 
them again for quite a while; I 
never saw a magazine stand that 
carried them, in Minnesota, and 
had to wait till I got to Washing- 
ton. I had to borrow from Milt 
Rothman to backtrack and read all 
the old stuff. 

That first magazine had had an 
Ed Hamilton center-of-the-earth 
story in it, and I thought he was 
great. Doc Smith I loved, of course; 
John Campbell, with his heavy- 
science Arcot, Wade and Morey 
stories. I liked Raymond Gallun 
very much, in fact his stuff I can 
still look back on with pleasure. I 
was pretty much for the heavy- 
science and strong adventure peo- 
ple, at least until I came across 
Stanley Weinbaum’s A Martian 
Odyssey. That was quite a shock 
and quite a revelation; it was a 
U6 




sort of turning point in my whole 
attitude. 

I kept on reading sf, just for 
fun, until some years later I was 
reading a story called Pithecanth- 
ropus Rejectus, by Manly Wade 
Wdlman, along about December, 
1937. I didn’t like it. I said so — 
perhaps in slightly strong words; 
matter of fact, I threw the maga- 
zine across the room. The gal I was 
going with had some very harsh 
words about that, and about my 
right to criticize anyway, since I 
hadn’t written anything myself. I 
wasn’t presumptuous enough to 
think I could get a story published, 
but I was pretty sure I could write 
one, and even get a letter from the 
editor instead of a rejection slip — 
I had pretty good reason to believe 
that, since I more or less knew the 
editor, at least through letters. The 
girl doubted that too, so I had to 
sit down and write a story to prove 
my point. I wrote it at 8,000 words, 
because I was suffering from log- 
orrhea, as all writers do in the be- 
ginning, but I was smart enough to 
know that you got much better at- 
tention from an editor when you 
sent him a short piece first, so I 
cut it down to 4,000 by taking a 
red pencil and going zoop , zoop, 
zoop and retyping it. I sent it off; 
and actually, I didn’t get a letter 
from the editor; what he did was 
to send me a check — just about 
the first week of January, 1938. 

After that, of course, I sat down 
AUTHORGRAPHS 



and wrote a couple of others. They 
didn’t sell — or not then; one did 
some years later, another got lost. 
That one was about digging ice on 
Mars. A real genuine adventure 
story, full of a girl, and monsters, 
and all kinds of things. Looking 
back on it, I’m not so sure it’s a 
bad thing it got lost. 

But that was it, for then. I’d 
been to the well three times and 
sold once, more or less by accident ; 
I figured that, like most writers, I 
was a one-story writer, so I gave it 
up . until the editor wrote me 
and asked for another story. 

So I went out and bought a copy 
of Writers 9 Yearbook , in which he’d 
been talking about what he liked 
in sf stories. He had a long article, 
pointing out that he wanted hu- 
man reactions; strong human ele- 
ment; if the story was about a ro- 
bot, he wanted a human robot. So 
I said to myself, uh-huh, what’s the 
most human thing a robot can do? 
Fall in love? So I sat down and 
wrote Helen O’Loy , which he 
bought. And then I began doing it 
seriously — in all honesty I don’t 
know how many, but around twen- 
ty science-fiction books and I don’t 
know how many others. 

I think good science-fiction is 
very much worth reading. But I’m 
not really interested too much in 
what it’s “worth”; I think it’s fun 
to read, and that interests me a 
lot more. If I want to get educated 
in philosophy and the injustices 

147 




that are done to the poor people of 
the Stuth and what every good 
yotiftg college boy is thinking and 
so Oft, 111 go out and get myself 
serioas books on the subject. The 
purpose of fiction is to entertain; 
I prefer to be entertained. 

Oft© of the beauties of good sci- 
ence fiction is you never really 
quite know what’s going to happen 
next. There are unlimited possibil- 
ities* A good science-fiction writer 
is gpiftg to have details that you 
never thought about, because he’s 
building a dream right in front of 
you. He’s making up a whole world, 
a whole civilization before your 
eyes. 

I ttke science in my science fic- 
tion. I don’t demand it every time, 
becaose I’m willing to settle for a 
little romance now mid then; but 
I like to see whatever science is 
there reasonably accurate. If, the 
man. is going to use science basi- 
cally for his takeoff, I want him to 
use it, I want him to develop it ac- 
curately. 

There’s plenty going on in sci- 
ence right now that would make 
good sf stories. Take biochemistry. 
The business of gene engineering, 
mutations created by the future 
gene manipulator, has tremendous 
possibilities, and damn few science- 
fiction writers are doing anything 
with it. It seems to me this is the 
first time a wonderful new field has 
opened up, and sf writers have said 
ho-hum and gone back to imitating 
i 4 * 



the old stuff. I did one, called The 
Eleventh Commandment . The hero 
is a Martian cytologist, used to 
manipulating genes; I had to set 
up a way where he could actually 
get into it and manipulate it: a 
special microscope, with fields to 
control the temperature very rapid- 
ly, so that he could slow down the 
cell and hold it for operations, or 
speed it up to see the results. There 
was a plague with the deep-sea 
plant life, so that the one-celled 
plants were suddenly flipping over 
to animals — there is, incidentally, 
one form of such life that actually 
does that, but in the story it does 
it consistently. The problem was to 
find out why. Our hero finds out 
that there’s a virus in there which 
apparently has mutated, and now 
swaps parts with these cells. 
There’s more, of course. The point 
I’m making is that I don’t know 
very many other examples of that 
in modem sf. And I don’t know 
why. 

And the new cosmological stuff 
is interesting. I think that in the 
old days writers would have been 
going nuts about quasars, coming 
up with half a dozen cockeyed 
ideas about pulsars and so on. But 
they don’t, any more. 

I’d like to see Isaac Asimov 
writing a story about an android, 
using the genuine biological knowl- 
edge he has, creating the android 
because it was necessary for some 
empire-saving reasons. I wish Fred 

IF 




Hoyle would touch on astronomy 
In his stories more; he can write 
science fiction, and he’s got the 
knowledge for it, and a good imag- 
ination, too. I’d like to see what 
Heinlein could do in that field. 
He’s given little bits of hints at 
times; in Methuselah’s Children, 
for instance. 

Larry Niven, I think, is doing 
a fine job with the neutron stars 
and the exploding galaxies; I’m all 
in favor of it. What I’d like to see 
him try is something with a little 
romance in it. 

Among the contemporary writers, 
most of the so-called New Wave 
writers I don’t have much use for. 
(Note the “so-called.” Brian Aldiss 
for instance, I don’t regard as a 
New Wave writer; he himself says 
he isn’t.) Most of Zelazny’s stuff 
I think has been 'damn good; I 
don’t like some of his stuff, because 
I think he’s gotten much too typed, 
straining too hard to get religious 
elements in, where he no longer has 
much enthusiasm; but he’s good. I 
like Burt Filer’s stuff; I thought 
he was a happy combination of old 
and new. And I like Tiptree’s work. 
He has something that’s rather un- 
usual nowadays; he even has a 
good bit of style. There’s liveliness 
to it, and a certain adaptability to 
it. 

I’d be glad to discuss science- 
fiction critics, but first someone 
will have to name one. There are 
a few good book reviewers. I have 
AUTHORGRAPHS 



no objection to Schuyler Miller as 
a reviewer; he gives you a kind of 
an idea of whether you want to 
read it or not. I rather liked Bob 
Silverberg in that field. I thought 
he did a good competent review; 
but that wasn’t criticism. 

When you use the word “critic,” 
you probably mean people like 
Damon Knight and Jim Blish. 
Damon’s criticism, as far as I’m 
concerned, is mostly a total mis- 
understanding of the “new criti- 
cism” that went out in the ’30’s. 
Blish can be perceptive as hell — 
and jinperceptive as hell. You have 
to read the book first to decide 
whether you like his criticism of it. 
Real criticism I don’t think exists 
in the field. 

Every so often a science-fiction 
movie comes along that’s delight- 
ful. I don’t know whether it’s ev- 
ery ten years or every twenty years. 
The Day the Earth Stood Still was 
a fine job. I liked Forbidden Plan- 
et. Planet of the Apes wasn’t bad; 
a little heavy-handed and a little 
obvious, but it was kind of fun. 
2001? Well, I’ve said my piece on 
that. The acting was better than 
usual; the photography was often 
superb; some of the mechanical 
work in it was wonderful; it’s just 
too bad that Stanley Kubrick 
couldn’t let Clarke do a real sf 
story, and then do his best to fol- 
low it. 

Some of the TY hasn’t been bad.

were quite good. There was a lot 
of hokum built in, because they 
used series characters, but there 
were several good stories — Gene 
Roddenberry’s own* most of the 
time. 

His pilot script, with the cat, 
was almost as if Van Vogt had 
written it, and. I loved it. Most TV 
in the area has been either horror 
or fantasy, and the horror stuff, I 
think, is anti-science fiction. I said 
the other day at the Modern Lan- 
guage Association meeting that I 
thought one of the things that sci- 
ence fiction expresses strongly is 
that all intelligences are brothers; 
but the basic rule in most TV stuff 
is that it doesn’t matter how in- 
telligent you are, if your skin isn’t 
put on right you’re an alien and 
frightful. 

That I resent. 

What I wish sf writers would do 
is think . Think about their situa- 
tion until they begin to feel it; not 
be smart-Alecky. I’d like to pass a 
law against their believing they 
were artists. 

I think the average reader of 
science fiction is a lot better judge 
of the medium than most people 
seem to think he is. If a reader 
likes a story, he doesn’t have to 
give reasons for it. He’s perfectly 
capable of making up his own 
mind — and, on the average, I 
think he’ll be right.

suit’s control-bumps, lie swung the 
light across it again, slowly. Finally 
he decided it was only the shifting 
light that had made the thing ap- 
pear to move very slightly. 

He detoured a hundred feet 
around it. But before he’d gotten 
much beyond, he found that he 
wasn’t going to be able to avoid 
the machines by that far — there 
were too many of them. Some were 
as big as the first one he saw. Oth- 
ers were the smaller kind he’d seen 
pictures of. He saw one biped ro- 
bot — he knew those too, from the 
old books — but it was prone and 
inert, and didn’t look much like a 
man. One of its legs was cut off 
below the knee-joint. The stub had 
a fused look, as if some kind of 
heat-beam had burned it. 

There were other signs of vio- 
lence too. Most of the ’pairbots had 
tentacles missing, and he saw sev- 
eral of those amputated flexible 
steel members, many-jointed like 
the legs of insects, lying about. 

If there’d been any human 
corpses after those fearful battles, 
they were gone now. 

He wound his way through the 
relics. Ben Tomsun said he was off 
line a little, so he moved to his left. 

Presently his beam showed the 
bulkhead — a vertical wall of steel 
rising into the darkness. He located 
the hatch and paused to look be- 
hind and to both sides. 



Before be approached the hatch 
he talked to Ben Tomsun. “There’s 
a machine about twenty yards in 
front of it.” 

“Yes; it’s been there for about 
seventy years without moving. 
There’s another not far away from 
it. You’ll have to pass between. 
Tell me when you’re within ten 
yards of the hatch. Our detection’s 
not very precise there.” 

P ry strode slowly toward the 
gap between the two ma- 
chines. The one nearest the hatch 
was medium-sized, and a special- 
ized sort. It had the tri-wheeled 
base, and in the center of that was 
a vertical column that looked as if 
it were extensible — some kind of 
a hoist. There were half a dozen 
of the steel tentacles, and a bat- 
tery of things shaped like drums. 
Those looked familiar, from some 
picture. Yes — they were search- 
lights. He could see the shattered 
glass now, and the silvery curved 
reflectors. 

He moved a step closer — and 
the machine suddenly rolled to in- 
tercept him! Simultaneously there 
was a loud buzzing in his helmet. 
Distracted, he turned to run — 
and was suddenly bathed in daz- 
zling light from one side! Through 
the buzzing in his helmet, which 
was maddening, he thought he 
heard a faint voice shouting. And 
now other lights converged on him. 
He spun, saw vague shapes rolling 

151 



MAD SHIP 




toward him and crouched in pure 
terror for a moment. 

But he wasn’t a guardsman for 
nothing! Shame drove some of the 
panic from him. He reached hasti- 
ly for suit-controls; he pressed 
bumps that killed his own lights 
and sent him shooting straight up. 
He darted to one side to escape for 
a moment the savagely searching 
lights of the machines and swung 
his head about, trying to build up a 
mental picture of what lay about 
him. He was going to have to flee 
in the dark, and he didn’t want to 
slam into some trave-column I The 
lights found him again. He zoomed 
away erratically, trying to get be- 
hind a column; but the search- 
lights came from too many direc- 
tions. He dodged again. If only the 
maddening buzz in his helmet 
wwdd stop. He remembered Ben 
Temsun’s saying something about 
the lowest row of studs. He pressed 
one. The buzz broke off for an in- 
stant and resumed on a slightly dif- 
ferent tone — but louder, if any- 
thing! He tried another bump. 

Blessed silence! He went limp 
with relief. Now at least he could 
think. He zoomed higher, slanting 
up toward the outer hull, where 
the lights would have to reach far- 
ther. They hadn’t found him now 
for several seconds; all they did 
was provide light so he could see 
his way around. But unless Cap- 
tain Gerlik or whoever else di- 
rected the machines was stupid as 
152 



well as mad, that wouldn’t last for 
long. 

He had to find cover. Back into 
the sinus? No — he suspected very 
strongly there’d be an ambush 
waiting. Some other hatch that 
opened out of this compartment? 
He couldn’t go around looking for 
one. Nor could he, apparently, talk 
to Ben Tomsun; the old books had 
described radio jamming clearly 
enough so Pry recognized it. 

He needed a place to hide for a 
while until he could think, or until 
Ben Tomsun and his allies had 
time to organize help. 

That broken column! 

'fT7hile the slashing lights lasted 
** he shot that way, swerving 
and trying to stay hidden. He had 
to stop and wait for a searchlight 
to swing this way before he could 
see his objective. Then, when the 
light had passed, he flew slowly, 
groping ahead with his arms. He 
felt the girders, brought himself to 
a hover and tried to squeeze in be- 
tween two. Not enough room! He 
moved to the side, found another 
gap and slipped in through it. He 
maneuvered until his body was 
down inside the hollow column, 
with only his helmet in the clear so 
he could see. 

His panic was gone now. He 
knew he was in terrible danger, but 
it wasn’t immediate. He watched 
the machines rolling about. They 
apparently knew, he’d headed aft 

IF 




and that he’d gone far up toward 
the outer hull, and they were or- 
ganized in a line of search, their 
lights probing aloft. Would they 
recognize this pieced-together 
trave-column as a possible hiding- 
place? If so, he’d have to be ready 
to move fast! Of course, if the col- 
umn were hollow and uninterrupted 
for its full length, he could retreat 
far down. That wasn’t inviting, but 
at least he could get out of sight. 

Then he saw one of the medium- 
sized machines rise slowly from the 
sinus wall. His midriff contracted. 

So some of his mechanical pur- 
suers, at least, had grav-lifts in 
working order. 

Should he leave his concealment 
and try for the hole back into Sin- 
us B? If he could get through that 
. No. He wasn’t going to lead 
these madman’s machines back to 
his people. So long as Captain Ger- 
lik’s fatherly attitude lasted, they’d 
be all right. Pry mustn’t let the 
Ship find out he was one of them! 

Four machines were off the steel 
floor now. Only one maneuvered 
easily, but the others could fly and 
bring their searchlights up near the 
outer hull. He saw the agile one 
turn itself slowly in midair and con- 
tinue on until its wheels touched 
the outer hull. The event brought 
him a moment of confusion — he’d 
been thinking of the outer hull as 
up, and now suddenly, as he watch- 
ed the machine begin to roll toward 
him, he realized that the outer hull 



could be considered down as well. 

All right, he thought angrily, to 
the devil with that! Up or down, 
it’s coming this way. Its light 
moved toward his hiding-place. He 
lowered himself hastily out of sight. 
Other lights were sweeping the out- 
er hull now too, and reflected light 
spilled in upon him. 

Thinking he’d better reconnoiter 
into the column, at least, while he 
had the chance, he let himself fall 
slowly. 

His feet touched something 
yielding. 

Hastily he moved aside and peer- 
ed at the thing. The dim light from 
above showed a slick surface. The 
light strengthened for a moment . 

He shuddered. The thing was a 
human corpse in a pressure-suit. 
He hung there staring at it. 

VII 

nphis victim, unlike the frozen 
ones in the dark hall of Sin- 
us B, hadn’t escaped decay. The 
death-face behind the helmet win- 
dow was ghastly; the flesh rotted 
away, the teeth exposed. 

TTie grim relic seemed anchored 
somehow to the inner curve of the 
column. 

The light faded. Pry hovered for 
a while until he felt it wasn’t com- 
ing back, then rose to where he 
could peer out. The machines 
weren’t far away, but the pattern 
of the search seemed to be aimed 



154 



IF 




even farther after — where the 
searchlights showed a warped and 
ruptured bulkhead, not more than 
two hundred feet from the hole in- 
to the sinus. Did they suspect he’d 
fled into a farther-aft compartment? 
Maybe. Or maybe they were Just 
faking — Gerlik might cunningly 
hope to lure him into the open. 

Well, he wasn’t going to bite yet. 
He waited. After a while curiosity 
prompted him to go down and in- 
vestigate the suited corpse that 
hung there so oddly. 

Feeling about in the dark, he’d 
presently solved the thing. 

The man, obviously, had been 
dropping down inside the column 
— hastily, perhaps, to avoid some 
pursuit — and had gotten snagged. 
There, on the otherwise smooth 
steel, a terrible spike thrust upward 
and inward — a spike created by 
the impact of something that had 
crashed against the outside of the 
column. That murderous dagger 
had punched through the plastic 
suit and into the man’s spine. 

When? At the time of the Catas- 
trophe? Or more recently, in some 
furtive reconnaissence into this dark 
no-man’s-land? 

Pry brooded about it for a while. 
He himself might meet some such 
fate before the hour was out! 

Then, slowly, an idea began to 
crystallize in his mind. He was too 
late to do anything for the dead 
man — but possibly the dead man 
could do something for him! 

MAD SHIP 



Did the punctured suit still have 
power? Of course — it was hanging 
precisely where he’d let go of it 
after hoisting it off the snag, which 
me,ant it was set on automatic 
hover. The occupant must have 
accomplished that much before he 
died. 

With queasy shivers along his 
spine, Pry worked the grisly thing 
up the column and got it wedged 
between two girders, aligned so the 
head aimed aft and a little down. 
Then he felt carefully of its con- 
trol bumps, readying himself to 
push two. But before he did that 
he tried his own helmet radio again 
— and got the same loud, distract- 
ing buzz. 

Well, he couldn’t talk to Ben 
Tomsun yet, then. Should he wait 
longer, hoping rescue would come? 
He thought not. Ben Tomsun must 
assume he was dead by now. And 
the longer he waited, the more like- 
ly the machines or whoever direct- 
ed them were to decide he was still 
in this compartment after all, and 
concentrate here. 

If he could get near the hatch 
and run back and forth for a mo- 
ment, wouldn’t Ben Tomsun be able 
to feel him? That was a question. 
What were his alternatives? To try 
for the sinus and hide there; to 
look for some other way out of the 
compartment; to wait where he was. 
Or maybe to dash out in a brief 
attack against the machines. 

None of those attracted him. 

155 




T T e took a deep breath and 

^ pressed the chosen bumps on 
the corpse’s suit. The girders held 
it for a moment; then it tugged 
free and slanted aft, fairly well 
aimed toward the hole in the sinus 
wall. 

Pry waited no longer. He launch- 
ed himself in the opposite direction 
slowly, straining his eyes to see by 
what dim light bounced this way. 
He swerved around a column, then 
tilted himself parallel to it so that, 
by twisting his helmet, he could see 
aft. The searchlights were still 
swinging there. He passed another 
column. 

He couldn’t see the suited corpse 
when they located it, but he could 
tell by the way the lights swung. 
Now most of them converged on 
one spot. His pulse quickened with 
hope, and he turned his head for- 
ward again. 

But there was very little light 
reflecting to this end of the com- 
partment now. He had to go by 
dead reckoning. When he felt he 
must surely be near the bulkhead, 
he drifted very slowly. 

Finally his outstretched fingers 
touched a surface. He moved later- 
ally to make sure it was the bulk- 
head, then let himself down slowly 
until he felt the sinus wall beneath 
his feet. 

He looked aft. The machines 
were headed this way again! Sick- 
ness formed in his middle. Should 
he grope along, hoping to find the 
156 



hatch by feel? Suppose he ran back 
and forth where he was? Would Ben 
Tomsun correctly interpret what- 
ever was felt, or assume it was some 
light machine? If he only knew 
more about things! 

The machines were coming as if 
they’d already seen through the 
trick. Then Pry realized Gerlik 
could feel him here! 

In desperation, he turned on all 
his lights and directed the beam 
along the base of the bulkhead. 
Where was the hatch ? 

There! In dismay, he saw that 
he’d missed it by nearly a hundred 
yards. He ran as fast as the suit 
would let him, swerved around a 
dead machine and cast a hasty 
look aft. Search-lights speared to- 
ward him now. Was Ben Tomsun 
alert? Would he understand? 

A machine rolled feebly to inter- 
cept him. He dodged around it. An- 
other was between him and the 
hatch — and moving as if to block 
it physically with its own bulk. 
Searchlights fixed on him precise- 
ly, making him feel as conspicuous 
and vulnerable as an egg on a table. 

Something heavy hurtled through 
the air, missing him only by two 
feet, and slammed against the bulk- 
head at hip-height. He sprinted 
desperately, seeing that the slowly- 
trundling machine would reach the 
hatch before he did. 

A voice — Gerlik’s, no doubt pro- 
jected via the machines — thund- 
ered, “Stop, traitor!” 



IF 




'T'hen, abruptly, the hatch slid 
open and light spilled 
through! The slow machine didn’t 
pause. But from the open hatch 
shot another big shape, blocking 
the light for an instant. It crashed 
directly into the blockader. Pry felt 
the jar and heard the rending of 
metal and saw objects fly. Then he 
dodged around the locked-togeth- 
er machines and hurled himself 
through the hatch. It slammed shut 
behind him. 

And then he stood gasping for 
breath and staring at four men in 
suits identical to his own. Each had 
a pistol of some sort — a heavy 
kind — in his hand. But the hands 
hung limp as four pairs of eyes 
stared back at Pry. 

Presently he felt himself grin- 
ning. It wasn’t all one-sided, this 
wonder he felt! It was the first 
time they’d ever seen a man from 
Sinus B! 

One of them grinned back and 
said in ordinary English, “Turn on 
your radio.” 

Pry said, “It’s being jammed.” 
But he tried it nevertheless. To his 
surprise the buzzing was faint, and 
through it came the voice of Ben 
Tomsun. 

“So you got through alive! I 
hope you’ll let your escort bring 
you to my compartment at once. 
After all this, I’m anxious to get a 
look at you!” 

There were several of the big 
compartments to pass through, all 



of them lighted and all apparently 
in friendly hands, then an airlock 
with double doors. After that one 
of the four men said, “We’re in 
Nose Cone now.” 

Nose Cone! A phrase from leg- 
ends. Pry looked around. The com- 
partment was smaller than the ones 
he’d just passed through, and there 
were a number of doors in it — 
overhead as well as in the floor 
and walls. From somewhere came 
the muffled hum and throb of 
machinery. And then there was 
a twisting corridor that left Pry 
with the impression they’d entered 
a gravity at right angles to the one 
he’d expected; and there were 
people, who stared at him, and a 
glimpse of a tree-covered deck 
through a doorway. Then, finally, 
divested of his suit, he stood in a 
small room, alone except for Ben 
Tomsun. 

VIII 

T)ry realized he must have re- 
sisted, at gun level, the know- 
ledge that Ben Tomsun wasn’t a 
living man; for he was dazed now. 

The cabinet of shiny metal was 
rectangular and more or less the 
size of a man. That helped a little. 
So did the horizontal row of small 
holes at about face-height and the 
mesh-covered opening below them. 
These could be thought of as eyes, 
ears, nostrils and mouth. The voice 
did come from the mesh-covered 



MAD SHIP 



157 




opening. But aside from that, it was 
a simple featureless box, probably 
of acrysteel. 

Ben Tomsun must have known 
how he felt. “Forgive the way I 
present myself. I’m not really con- 
fined to this box. My personality is 
scattered among various computer- 
banks of the Ship, all scrambled 
up with other personalities, history, 
technologies, Euclidean and non- 
Euclidean geometries, and data such 
as the germination-time of peach- 
pits. But I and the other recorded 
brains prefer these cabinets. They 
give us at least a tenuous simile to 
the time when we had live bodies.” 

Pry stared dumbly for a minute. 
The first words he blurted were, 
“You don’t sound insane!” 

Ben Tomsun sighed. “I hope 
I’m not. I can’t explain to you ex- 
actly how things are with me. 
There was the original Ship’s com- 
puter-intelligence, then human per- 
sonalities were programmed in, for 
reasons that were probably partly 
emotional. But some of us changed. 
I guess that was inevitable. Grad- 
ually we took over many of the 
Ship’s functions. Whether the pure- 
ly mechanical intelligence would 
have gone insane at the time of the 
Catastrophe is something we de- 
bate and ponder among ourselves. 
But Captain Gerlik and a few oth- 
ers did lose their sanity. He and 
one other were in control of most 
of the Ship; and as I’ve told you, 
they warred between them. Gerlik 
158 



overcame the other personality, or 
absorbed it. The rest of us hadn’t 
nearly as much power, but by join- 
ing together and by careful maneuv- 
ering, we were able to clear him 
out of Nose Cone and some com- 
partments of Main Hull. We infil- 
trated the environment-main- 
tenance systems for Sinus B, but 
couldn’t take them over. And that 
leaves your people in serious dan- 
ger. There’s a reason why we have 
to get you out of there soon. Well, 
two reasons, actually — the less ur- 
gent being the need to take over 
and finish repairs.” 

Pry said, “I can understand that. 
With the universe destroyed, the 
Ship has to last as long as is physi- 
cally possible. Even so ... ” 

Ben Tomsun chuckled. “That’s 
one of the reasons we wanted you 
up here — to convince you that the 
universe has not been destroyed! 
We don’t know precisely what Cap- 
tain Gerlik or his rival told your 
ancestors at the time of the Catas- 
trophe, nor all of what he’s told 
you since. By the way — won’t you 
please tell me your name?” 

“Well . Pryingboy Thorp. I 
guess I was, uh, a nosy child.” 

'T'he voice laughed briefly. “Well, 
Thorp, this is what hap- 
pened. We were skirting a cloud 
nebula — a great mass of dust and 
gas — when we were unexpectedly 
thrown off course by a small, dark, 
very dense, invisible body — prob- 

IF 




ably the core of a long-dead star. 
It whirled us into the cloud, tail- 
first. Tidal forces — I guess you 
don’t know about those — did some 
damage, but the worst was the 
frictional heat. Spots of the hull 
softened and bulged out and rup- 
tured. You’ve seen the hasty patch- 
es. The heat penetrated far enough 
to soften the wall of Sinus B too, 
in one spot. It was touch and go 
whether we’d survive at all. Cap- 
tain Gerlik, who was under the 
worst strain for a long period, went 
insane. While we were in the cloud, 
the stars were hidden from us. 
That’s all.” The voice paused as if 
the cabinet were scrutinizing Pry. 
“You don’t look as if you believed 
me.” 

Ben Tomsun sighed again. “I 
wish it were possible to put you in 
a pressure-suit and send you Out- 
side to see for yourself, but that 
would take too much time. This 
will have to do.” 

A section of the wall behind the 
cabinet suddenly slid aside. For a 
moment Pry thought there was a 
five-foot-square hole; then he saw 
that it was a dark screen of some 
kind. 

The screen suddenly blossomed 
with tiny points of light. At one 
edge was a convoluted mass of light 
and dark. Ben Tomsun said, “That 
luminoisity at the edge is the cloud 
we passed through. The points of 
light are stars. Have you seen pic- 
tures of a starfield?” 



Hope and doubt fought a cut- 
lass-battle inside Pry. He swallowed 
hard. “I’ve seen small pictures.” 

“Now,” the voice said. The 

screen suddenly lit all over. There 
was a mottled pattern of greenish 
blue. It seemed to shrink in upon 
itself, and became a half-disc. Pry 
drew in his breath sharply. “That’s 
a picture of Earth! Is Earth 

still — ” 

Ben Tomsun said, “We’re far 

out of telescope-range of Sol, but 

we have no reason to think that 
anything’s happened to Earth. This 
is not a picture of Earth — it’s the 
next planet we’re going to colonize. 
It’s earthlike and primitive. Listen 
carefully, Thorp! We’re in wide or- 
bit around this planet right now. 
All of us, except for a few who re- 
main aboard Main Hull in orbit to 
do necessary things, such as re- 
pairing the hull and trying to cure 
Captain Gerlik, will be landing in 
Nose Cone. Your people will have 
to clear one of the Sinus B exits 
your ancestors blocked up and 
come out the near end. Oh, I don’t 
mean within the next few hours; 
it’ll take time to convince them. 
And a few people have to land in 
gravcars — you’ve read about 
those? — for preliminary explor- 
ations. But you will have to start 
persuading your people. The alter- 
native is that we’ll try to take over 
control of the sinus from Captain 
Gerlik. And that might end in dis- 
aster for your people.” 



MAD SHIP

The voice was silent for a min- 
ute. “This is a lot for you to swal- 
low in a hurry, I know, but I 
haven’t time to show you more di- 
rectly, or to let you mull it over. 
One reason I haven’t is that the 
agent who went into the sinus may 
be in deadly peril. You have to get 
back in time to forestall any exe- 
cution. Now, may I have your de- 
cision?” 

T)ry stood there, so full of feel- 
ings he could hardly breathe. 
He was shocked and angry at such 
a blunt ultimatum. Yet, if it were 
all true . 

To have a whole planet to live 
on . 

The voice said gently, “If you 
succeed with your own people 
quickly, you can be part of one of 
the exploration teams. Is that any 
inducement?” 

Pry squirmed mentally. He fin- 
ally burst out, “Damn it! If you’re 
eight hundred years old — ” 

“Six hundred. I never saw 
Earth.” 

“Well, if you’re that old, you 
know how I feel! Of course it’s an 
inducement! Any man . But I’m 
no spy! I wouldn’t know the first 
thing about — about — ” 

“About spreading a sudden 
truthPi Naturally we wouldn’t ex- 
pect you to work alone. That agent 
who’s already there — if you get 
back in time — ” 

Pry trembled for a minute more, 
160 



then took a deep breath. “All right! 
What choice do I have, anyway? 
I — I have to believe you or dis- 
believe you, and ...” He stared 
away for a moment. “I lied to you 
about that agent. I said we had 
him under control. We didn’t. But 
if he tries to pose as one of us — ” 
Ben Tomsun said amusedly, “I 
knew you were lying.” 

Pry scowled at the cabinet. “Oh. 
Well... Are you going to tell me 
how to find him?” 

“Not exactly.” 

“Not — why, in God’s name?” 
“Because it isn’t a ‘he’, and 
you’ve undoubtedly already found 
her. She was going to call herself 
‘Marytwo Garth.’ ” 

Ben Tomsun said tersely, “We 
had to make contact. You, or your 
ancestors, killed every man we sent 
in. She volunteered. We aren’t play- 
ing games, Thorp! Will you work 
with her?” 

Pry tinned slowly and took a 
few blind steps. Such a big suit, 
and such a small girl. But it was 
clever. And she must have stuck 
that dart into her own shoulder, 
calmly abandoned herself to un- 
consciousness and whatever luck 
had in store. After first stopping 
Muller, so he couldn’t report. 
What a woman! 

He whirled back to face the cab- 
inet. “I’ll help! And — uh — that 
exploration team I may go on. 
Might she, uh, be part of it too?” 
Ben Tomsun chuckled. END

Dear Editor: 

It’s hard to believe that none 
of the Huers & Criers who have ex- 
pressed their appreciation for Asi- 
mov’s “The Holmes-Ginsbook De- 
vice” (Dec. 1968) have detected this 
story’s most delicious quality, name- 
ly, as a brilliantly malicious parody 
on Watson’s & Crick’s Nobelled re- 
search on the structure of the DNA 
molecule. The parody begins in the 
very title (read “Watson-Crick” for 
“Holmes-Ginsbook”) and goes on 
from there in remarkably detailed 
parallel to the original. That the spirit 
in which Asimov wrote it was not 
entirely one of good clean fun only 
adds spice to the knowledgeable 
reader’s enjoyment, for the malice is 
entirely justified — the Watson-Crick 
work scarcely begins to exemplify the 
independence and originality that a 
Nobel Prize is supposed to token, 
and unlike Watson few good scien- 
tists see their research primarily as a 
means to ego glorification. I don’t 
mean to suggest for a moment that 
the typical scientist is self-effacingly 
indifferent to status and adulation; 
but these are secondary gains from 
his research, not its main purpose — 
William W. Rozeboom, University of 



Alberta, Department of Psychology, 
Edmonton, Canada. 

& You’re right, of course about the 
story being a take-off on the book. 
Dr. Asimov — to use his official 
title — was having his fun at certain 
traits he found in the original. Of 
course, he was good natured about it, 
unlike some who seem to have been 
very bitter about the account. As you 
may have noticed, we tried to indi- 
cate by a kind of atrocious pun in 
the “blurb” over the story that 
“Holmes-Ginsbook” was a parody. 

It’s a little hard to generalize about 
what leads a scientist to win a Nobel 
prize, however. Undoubtedly a great 
many men — Fermi, for example — 
have been motivated only by a truly 
scientific desire to understand some 
aspect of the universe. 

Does it really matter? It might be 
nice to think of all scientists as high- 
minded men who care not for the 
plaudits of the masses, or even the 
highest award of their fellows. But 
in any event, somehow the work gets 
done. It isn’t the motivation, but the 
increased understanding of the great 
environment around us, that remains 
when the tumuk and the shouting die.
