How I foxed 
the Navy 

by Arthur Godfrey 



The Navy almost scuttled me. I shudder to 
think of it. My crazy career could have ended, 
right there. Who knows, I might still he bum- 
ming Chesterfields instead of selling them. 

To be scuttled by the Navy you’ve either 
got to do something wrong or neglect to do 
something right. They’ve got yon both ways. 
For my part, I neglected to finish high school. 

Ordinarily, a man can get along without a 
high school diploma. Plenty of men have. But 
not in the Navy. At least not in the U. S. Navy 
Materiel School at Bellevue, D. C., back in 
1929. In those days a bluejacket had to have 
a mind like Einstein’s. And I didn’t. 

*T?odfrey,” said the lieutenant a few days 
after I’d checked in, “either yon learn mathe- 
matics and learn it fast or out yon go. I’ll give 
you six weeks.” This, I figured, was it. For a 
guy who bad to take off his shoes to count 




above ten, it was an impossible assignment. 

I was ready to turn in my bell-bottoms. But 
an ad in a magazine stopped me. Here, it said, 
is your chance to get special training in almost 
any subject— mathematics included. I hopped 
on it. Within a week I was enrolled with the 
International Correspondence Schools studying 
algebra, geometry and trig for all I was worth. 

Came week-end liberty, I studied. Came a 
holiday, I studied. Came the end of the six 
weeks, I was top man in the class. Within 
six weeks I had mastered two years of high 
school math, thanks to the training I’d gotten. 

I.CS. made the impossible— easy!

rpHE editorial “To the Hills!” 
in the Oct. 1953 issue seemed 
alarmingly clear when I wrote 
it. All of us, I stated, have paper 
clips, rubber bands, peifcils, 
string, glue, clothes hangers and 
such — without any of us ever 
buying them! Yet somebody 
must, otherwise the factories 
would go out of business. 

My conclusion was that by 
making us dependent on these 
items, aliens could take over 
Earth simply by withdrawing 
them. Armies can’t move, govern- 
ments can’t govern, civilians can’t 
escape without pencils for notes, 
string and glue to make bundles, 
paper clips to hold documents 
together and nothing to hang 
clothes on. 

It was beautifully rounded rea- 
soning, all holes plugged, no loose 
ends left around . and a thun- 
dering herd of readers kicked the 
whole structure to pieces. 

Capt. K. F. Slater, England; 
“Ask any woman who sews what 
happens to the pins she buys. 
She takes ’em all out, puts them 
away carefully, but she always 
has to buy more. So it is obvious 
that your aliens take our pins 
and give us the other items in 
exchange.” 

Lt. Arthur L. Thomas, Travis 
A.F.B., Cal.: “Millions of people 



in this country: tens of millions 
of matches disappearing every 
day. They’ll all reappear at once 
— burning]” 

Marion Cox, Sioux City, Iowa: 
“My rubber bands, paper clips 
and bobby pins vanish. I can 
never find pencil when I want 
one and I buy them by the dozen. 
Oh, the humiliation! I’m be- 
ing snubbed — by extraterrestrials 
yet!” 

Anthony Boucher, our cher- 
ished rival on Fantasy fis Science 
Fiction, argues that he and his 
equally likable co-editor, J. 
Francis McComas, can never lo- 
cate any of the items. 

Raymond L. Allard, Minneap- 
olis, Minn.: ‘‘I’m the guy who 
buys all these things everybody 
else uses.” 

Well, that’s what every scien- 
tist has to face. He builds up a 
theory that takes in all known 
data . and then discovers he’s 
only half right. Where does the 
other half fit? 

Dean Grennell, Fond du Lac, 
Wis., thinks his oldest daughter 
uses his paper clips and rubber 
bands for shooting at birds. He 
had to buy string to sell his 
basement ziggurat of old news- 
papers — string, 35(f ; sale, 30(J ; net 
loss, 5^!. When he finally finds 
one of his lost ashtrays, it’s full

of hairpins, seashells and cray- 
olas. 

Either we’re dealing here with 
clever “people” or they honestly 
don’t see the flaws in their argu- 
ments. 

Mr. Grennell, as an example, 
reveals a number of unconscious- 
ly telling facts: 

He accumulates newspapers. I 
hadn’t thought of that as one of 
the invasion weapons, but it could 
be. He has pencils of all sizes, 
lengths and hardnesses, of which 
he bought “dam near” every one. 
Would a pencil-by-pencil audit 
prove that claim? I doubt it. He 
periodically has to haul armloads 
ot clothes hangers to a tailor 
named Joe Rupp (an alien pun?) 
and uses a .38 to get rid of. his 
eternally growing heap ot used 
flashbulbs. 

Mr. Allard confesses to saving 
string, while his wife hoards tissue 
and wrapping paper. 

The others admit nothing — a 
damning omission. Bill Burch, 
Rockville Centre, N. Y., confirms 
that uneasy suspicion: “I use 
great gobs of glue, paper clips 
and rubber bands and no sooner 
get in a shipment than they’re 
gone. Now how do I get them 
back . and explain on the 
profit-and-loss statement? P.S. I 
don’t particularly care to be re- 
ferred to as an invader after this. 
P.P.S. Don’t worry about the 



string — I’ll explain that when I 
have more time.” 

Gobs of paper clips and mbber 
bands! That may be an important 
clue. What kind of profit-and-loss 
statement? What does he mean 
by “after this” and when he has 
“more time"? 

After this disturbing communi- 
que, the comfort offered by 
Arthur A. Mennillo, Ft. Walton, 
Fla., is not enough. He agrees that 
he has a profusion of the invasion 
weapons, but assures us that 
when the factories close, after the 
alien funds are cut off, there will 
be enough to last ten years, by 
then, science will discover sub- 
stitutes and save the world. (I 
hope he means better hangers. 
The present ones fall off at a 
touch or cling together inextric- 
ably.) 

A nameless reader says: “The 
number of those owning the items 
exactly equals those who don’t.” 
An alien accoimtant, eh? 

Perhaps H. W. Seyle, Venice, 
Cal., can be made to talk: “Many 
years went into development of 
this foolproof invasion plan. Your 
perception has earned you an 
honored place in the coming sys- 
tem.” 

I’m not bought that easily, 
“Mr. Seyle” — not, at any rate, by 
putting me in charge of paper 
clips!

BEEP 




By JAMES BUSH 



Earth's Secret Service kept peace in the 
Galaxy efficiently— very efficiently. It was 
a/ways there . , before trouble started! 



Illustrated by EMSH 



I 

J OSEF Faber lowered his 
newspaper slightly. Finding 
the girl on the park bench 
looking his way, he smiled the 
agonizingly embarrassed smile of 
the thoroughly married nobody 
caught bird -watching, and duck- 
ed back into the paper again. 

He was reasonably certain that 
he looked the part of a middle- 
aged, steadily employed, harm- 
less citizen enjoying a Sunday 



break in the bookkeeping and 
family routines. He was also 
quite certain, despite his official 
instructions, that it wouldn’t 
make the slightest bit of differ- 
ence if he didn’t. These boy- 
meets-girl assignments always 
came off. Jo had never tackled a 
single one that had required him. 

As a matter of fact, the news- 
paper, which he was supposed to 
be using only as a blind, inter- 
ested him a good deal more than 
his job did. He had only barely 



BEEP 



7 



begun to suspect the obvious ten 
years ago when the Service had 
snapped him up; now, after a 
decade as an agent, he was still 
fascinated to see how smoothly 
the really important situations 
came off. The dangerous situa- 
tions — not boy-meets-girl. 

This affair of the Black Horse 
Nebula, for instance. Some days 
ago the papers and the commen- 
tators had begun to mention re- 
ports of disturbances in that area, 
and Jo’s practiced eye had pick- 
ed up the mention. Something big 
was cooking. 

Today it had boiled over — the 
Black Horse Nebula had sudden- 
ly spewed ships by the hundreds, 
a massed armada that must have 
taken more than a century of 
effort on the part of a whole 
star-cluster, a production drive 
conducted in the strictest and 
most fanatical kind of secrecy — 

And, of course, the Service had 
been on the spot in plenty of time. 
With three times as many ships, 
disposed with mathematical pre- 
cision so as to enhlade the entire 
armada the moment it broke from 
the nebula. The battle had been 
a massacre, the attack smashed 
before the average citizen could 
even begin to figure out what it 
had been aimed at — and good had 
triumphed over evil once more. 

Of course. 

Furtive scuffings on the gravel 
drew his attention briefly. He 



looked at his watch, which said 
14:58:03. That was the time, ac- 
cording to his instructions, when 
boy had to meet girl. 

He had been given the strictest 
kind of orders to let nothing in- 
terfere with this meeting — the 
orders always issued on bpy- 
meets-girl assignments. But,' as 
usual, he had nothing to do but 
observe. The meeting was coming 
off on the dot, without any prod- 
ding from Jo. They always did. 

Of course. 

W ITH a sigh, he folded his 
newspaper, smiling again at 
the couple — yes, it was the right 
man, too — and moved away, as if 
reluctantly. He wondered what 
would happen were he to pull 
away the false mustache, pitch 
the newspaper on the grass, and 
bound away with a joyous 
whoop. He suspected that the 
course of history would not be 
deflected by even a second of arc, 
but he was not minded to try the 
experiment. 

The park was pleasant. The 
twin suns warmed the path and 
the greenery without any of the 
blasting heat which they would 
bring to bear later in the sum- 
mer. Randolph was altogether the 
most comfortable planet he had 
visited in years. A little back- 
ward, perhaps, but restful, too. 

It was also slightly over a hun- 
dred light-years away from 



8 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Earth. It would be interesting to 
know how Service headquarters 
on Earth could have known in 
advance that boy would meet girl 
at a certain spot on Randolph, 
precisely at 14:58:03.' 

Or how Service headquarters 
could have ambushed with micro- 
metric precision a major inter- 
stellar fleet, with no more 
preparation than a few days’ 
buildup in the newspapers and 
video could evidence. 

The press was free, on Ran- 
dolph as everywhere. It reported 
the news it got. Any emergency 
concentration of Service ships in 
the Black Horse area, or any- 
where else, would have been no- 
ticed and reported on. The Service 
did not forbid such reports for 
“security” reasons or for any 
other reasons. Yet there had been 
nothing to report but that (a) an 
armada of staggering size had 
erupted with no real warning 
from the Black Horse Nebula, 
and that (b) the Service had 
been ready. 

By now, it was a commonplace 
that the Service was always 
ready. It had not had a defect or 
a failure in well over two cen- 
turies. It had not even had a 
fiasco, the alarming - sounding 
technical word by which it re- 
ferred to the possibility that a 
boy-meets-girl assignment might 
not come off. 

Jo hailed a hopper. Once inside. 



he stripped himself of the mus- 
tache, the bald spot, the forehead- 
creases — all the make-up which 
had given him his mask of friend- 
ly innocuousness. 

The hoppy watched the whole 
process in the rear-view mirror. 
Jo glanced up and met his eyes. 

“Pardon me, mister, but I fig- 
ured you didn’t care if I saw you. 
You must be a Service man.” 
“That’s right. Take me to 
Service HQ, will you?” 

“Sure enough.” The hoppy 
gunned his machine. It rose 
smoothly to the express level. 
“First time I ever got close to a 
Service man. Didn’t hardly be- 
lieve it at first when I saw you 
taking your face off. You sure 
looked different.” 

“Have to, sometimes,” Jo said, 
preoccupied. 

“I’ll bet. No wonder you know 
all about everything before it 
breaks. You must have a thou- 
sand faces each, your own mother 
wouldn’t know you, eh? Don’t 
you care if I know about your 
snooping around in disguise?” 

J O grinned. The grin created a 
tiny pulling sensation across 
one curve of his cheek, just next 
to his nose. He stripped away the 
overlooked bit of tissue and ex- 
amined it critically. 

“Of course not. Disguise is an 
elementary part of Service work. 
Anyone could guess that. We 



BEEP 



9 



don’t use it often, as a matter 
of fact — only on very simple as- 
signments.” 

“Oh.” The hoppy sounded 
slightly disappointed, as melo- 
drama faded. He drove silently 
for about a minute. Then, specu- 
latively; ‘‘Sometimes I think the 
Service must have time-travel, 
the things they pull . well, 
here you are. Good luck, mister.” 

“Thanks.” 

Jo went directly to Krasna’s 
office. Krasna was a Randolpher, 
Earth-trained, and answerable to 
the Earth office, but otherwise 
pretty much on his own. His 
heavy, muscular face wore the 
same expression of serene con- 
fidence that was characteristic of 
Service officials everywhere — even 
some that, technically speaking, 
had no faces to wear it. 

“Boy meets girl,” Jo said brief- 
ly. “On the nose and on the spot.” 

“Good work, Jo. Cigarette?” 
Krasna pushed the box across his 
desk. 

“Nope, not now. Like to talk 
to you, if you’ve got time.” 

Krasna pushed a button, and a 
toadstool -like chair rose out of 
the floor behind Jo. “What’s on 
your mind?” 

“Well,” Jo said carefully. “I’m 
wondering why you patted me oii 
the back just now for not doing 
a job.” 

“You did a job.” 

“I did not,” Jo said flatly. “Boy 



would have met girl, whether I’d 
been here on Randolph or back 
on Earth. The course of true love 
always runs smooth. It has in all 
my boy-meets-girl cases, and it 
has in the boy-meets-girl cases 
of every other agent with whom 
I’ve compared notes.” 

“Well, good,” Krasna said, 
smiling. “That’s the way we like 
to have it run. And that’s the 
way we expect it to run. But, Jo, 
we like to have somebody on the 
spot, somebody with a reputation 
for resourcefulness, just in case 
there’s a snag. There almost never 
is, as you’ve observed. But — if 
there were?” 

Jo snorted. “If what you’re try- 
ing to do is to establish pre- 
conditions for the future, any 
interference by a Service agent 
would throw the eventual result 
farther oH the track. I know that 
much about probability.” 

“And what makes you think 
that we’re trying to set up the 
future?” 

“It’s obvious even to the hop- 
pies on your own planet; the one 
that brought me here told me he 
thought the Service had time- 
travel. It’s especially obvious to 
all the individuals and govern- 
ments and entire populations that 
the Service has bailed out of 
serious messes for centuries, with 
never a single failure.” Jo 
shrugged. “A man can be asked 
to safeguard only a small num- 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ber of boy-meets-girl cases be- 
fore he realizes, as an agent, that 
what the Service is safeguard- 
ing is the future children of 
those meetings. Ergo — the Service 
knows what those children are to 
be like, and has reason to want 
their future existence guaranteed. 
What other conclusion is pos- 
sible?” 

l^RASNA took out a cigarette 
and lit it deliberately; it was 
obvious that he was using the 
maneuver to cloak his response. 

“None," he admitted at last. 
“We have some foreknowledge, 
of course. We couldn’t have made 
our reputation _with espionage 
alone. But we have obvious other 
advantages: geneticsi, for instance, 
and operations research, the 
theory of games, the Dirac trans- 
mitter — it’s quite an arsenal, and 
of course there’s a good deal of 
prediction involved in all those 
things.” 

“I see that,” Jo said. He shifted 
in his chair, formulating all he 
wanted to say. He changed his 
mind about the cigarette and 
helped himself to one. “But these 
things don’t add up to infalli- 
bility — and that’s a qualitative 
difference, Kras. Take this affair 
of the Black Horse armada. The 
moment the armada appeared, 
we’ll assume. Earth heard about 
it by Dirac, and started to as- 
semble a counter-armada. But it 



takes finite time to bring together 
a concentration of ships and men, 
even if your message system is 
instantaneous. 

“The Service’s counter-armada 
was already on hand. It had been 
building there for -so long and 
with so little fuss that nobody 
even noticed it concentrating until 
a day or so before the battle. 
Then planets in the area began 
to sit up and take notice, and be 
uneasy about what was' going to 
break. But not very uneasy; the 
Service always wins — ^that’s been 
a statistical fact for centuries. 
Centuries, Kras. Good Lord, it 
takes almost as long as that, in 
straight preparation, to pull some 
of the tricks we’ve pulled! The 
Dirac gives us an advantage of 
ten to twenty-five years in^xeally 
extreme cases out on the rim of 
the Galaxy, but no more than 
that.” 

He realized that he had been 
fuming away on the cigarette un- 
til the roof of his mouth was 
scorched, and snubbed it out 
angrily. “That’s a very different 
thing,” he said, “than knowing 
in a general way how an enemy 
is likely to behave, or what kind 
of children . the Mendelian laws 
say a given couple should have. 
It means that we’ve some way of 
reading the future in minute de- 
tail. That’s in flat contradiction

believe what I see.” 

Krasna laughed. “That’s a 
very able presentation,” he said. 
He seemed genuinely pleased. “I 
think you’ll remember that you 
were first impressed into the 
Service when you began to won- 
der why the news was always 
good. Fewer and fewer people 
wonder about that nowadays; it’s 
become a part of their expected 
environment.” He stood up and 
ran a hand through his hair. 
“Now you’ve carried yourself 
through the next stage. Congratu- 
lations, Jo. You’ve just been 
promoted!” 

“I have?” Jo said incredulous- 
ly. “I came in here with the 
notion that I might get myself 
fired.” 

“No. Come around to this side 
of the desk, Jo, and I’ll play you 
a little history.” Krasna unfolded 
the desktop to expose a small 
visor screen. Obediently Jo rose 
and went around the desk to 
where he could see the blank 
surface. “I had a standard in- 
doctrination tape sent up to me 
a week ago, in the expectation 
that you’d be ready to see it. 
Watch." 

Krasna touched the board. A 
small dot of light appeared in the 
center of the screen and went out 
again. At the same time, there 
was a small beep of sound. Then 
the tape began to unroll and a 
picture clarified on the screen. 



“As you suspected,” Krasna 
said conversationally, “the Ser- 
vice is infallible. How it got that 
way is a story that started several 
centuries back. This tape gives all 
the dope. You should almost be 
able to imagine what really hap- 
pened . .”

I^ANA Lje — her father had 
been a Hollander, her moth- 
er bom in the Celebes — sat down 
in the chair which Captain Robin 
Weinbaum had indicated, crossed 
her legs, and waited, her blue- 
black hair shining under the 
lights. 

Weinbaum eyed her quizzical- 
ly. The conqueror Resident who 
had given the girl her entirely 
European name had been paid in 
kind, for his daughter’s beauty 
had nothing fair and Dutch about 
it. To the eye of the beholder, 
Dana Lje seemed a particularly 
delicate virgin of Bali, despite 
her western name, clothing and 
assurance. The combination had 
already proven piquant for the 
millions who watched her tele- 
vision column, and Weinbaum 
found it no less charming at first 
hand. 

“As one of your most recent 
victims,” he said, “I’m not sure 
that I’m honored, Miss Lje. A 
few of my wounds are still bleed- 
ing. But I am a good deal puzzled 



12

as to why you’re visiting me now. 
Aren’t you afraid that I’ll bite 
back?” 

“I had no intention of attack- 
ing you personally, and I don’t 
think I did,” the video columnist 
said seriously. “It was just pretty 
plain that our intelligence had 
slipped badly in the Erskine 
affair. It was my job to say so. 
Obviously you were going to get 
hurt, since you’re head of the 
bureau — but there was no malice 
in it.” 

“Cold comfort,” Weinbaum 
said dryly. “But thank you, 
nevertheless.” 

The Eurasian girl shrugged. 
“That isn’t what I came here 
about, anyway. Tell me. Captain 
Weinbaum — have you ever heard 
of an outfit calling itself Inter- 
stellar Information?” 

W EINBAUM shook his head. 

“Sounds like a skip-tracing 
firm. Not an easy business, these 
days.” 

“That’s just what I thought 
when I first saw their letterhead,” 
Dana said. “But the letter under 
it wasn’t one that a private-eye 
outfit would write. Let me read 
part of it to you.” 

Her slim fingers burrowed in 
her inside jacket pocket, and 
emerged again with a single sheet 
of paper. It was plain typewriter 
bond, Weinbaum noted auto- 
matically; she had brought only 



a copy with her, and had left the 
original of the letter at home. The 
copy, then, would be incomplete 
— probably seriously. 

“It goes like this: ‘Dear Miss 
Lje: As a syndicated video com- 
mentator with a wide audience 
and heavy responsibilities, you 
need the best sources of informa- 
tion available. We would like you 
to test our service, free of charge, 
in the hope of proving to you 
that it is superior to any other 
source of news on Earth. There- 
fore, we offer below several pre- 
dictions concerning events to 
come in the Hercules and the so- 
called “Three Ghosts” areas. If 
these predictions are fulfilled 
100% — no less — we ask that you 
take us on as your correspondents 
for those areas, at rates to be 
agreed upon later. If the predic- 
tions are wrong in any respect, 
you need not consider us furth- 
er.’ ” 

“H’m,” Weinbaum said slowly. 
“They’re confident cusses — and 
that’s an odd juxtaposition. The 
Three Ghosts make up only a 
little solar system, while the 
Hercules area could include the 
entire star-cluster — or maybe 
even the whole constellation, 
which is a hell of a lot of sky. 
This outfit seems to be trying to 
tell you that it has thousands of 
field correspondents of its own, 
maybe as many as the govern- 
ment itself. If so. I’ll guarantee 



BEEP 



13 



that they’re bragging.” 

“That may well be so. But 
before you make up your mind, 
let me read you one of the two 
predictions.” The letter rustled in 
Dana Lje’s hand. ‘“At 03:16:10, 
on Year Day, 2090, the Hess-type 
interstellar liner Brindisi will be 
attacked in the neighborhood of 
the Three Ghosts system by 
four—’ ” 

Weinbaum sat bolt upright in 
his swivel chair. “Let me see that 
letter!” he said, his voice harsh 
with repressed alarm. 

“In a moment,” the girl said, 
adjusting her skirt composedly. 
“Evidently I was right in riding 
my hunch. Let me go on reading: 
‘ — by four heavily armed vessels 
flying the lights of the navy of 
Hammersmith II. The position of 
the liner at that time will be 
at coded coordinates 88-A-theta- 
88-aleph-D and-per-se-and. It 
will—’ ” 

“Miss Lje,” Weinbaum said, 
“I’m sorry to interrupt you again, 
but what you’ve said already 
would justify me in jailing you 
at once, no matter how loudly 
your sponsors might scream. I 
don’t know about this Interstellar 
Information outfit, or whether or 
not you did receive any such 
letter as the one you pretend to 
be quoting. But I can tell you 
that you’ve shown yourself to be 
in possession of information that 
only yours truly and four other 



men are supposed to know. It’s 
already too late to tell you that 
everything you say may be held 
against you; all I can say now is, 
it’s high time you clammed up!” 

“1 THOUGHT so,” she said, 
apparently not disturbed in 
the least. “Then that liner is 
scheduled to hit those coor- 
dinates, and the coded time co- 
ordinate corresponds with the 
predicted Universal Time. Is it 
also true that the Brindisi will be 
carrying a top-secret communica- 
tions device?” 

“Are you deliberately trying to 
make me imprison you?” Wein- 
baum said, gritting his teeth. “Or 
is this just a stunt, designed to 
show me that my own bureau is 
full of leaks?” 

“It could turn into that,” Dana 
admitted. “But it hasn’t, yet. 
Robin, I’ve been as honest with 
you as I’m able to be. You’ve 
had nothing but square deals 
from me up to now. I wouldn’t 
yellow-screen you, and you know 
it. If this unknown outfit has 
this information, it might easily 
have gotten it from where it hints 
that it got it: from the field.” 

“Impossible.” 

. “Why?” 

“Because the information in 
question hasn’t even reached my 
own agents in the field yet — it 
couldn’t possibly have leaked as 
far as Hammersmith II or any- 



14 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



where else, let alone to the Three 
Ghosts system! Letters^ have to 
be carried on ships, you know 
that. If I were to send orders 
by ultrawave to my Three Ghosts 
agent, he’d have to wait three 
hundred and twenty -four years to 
get them. By ship, he can get 
them in a little over two months. 



“What, indeed,’’ Weinbaum 
said grimly. “You’d better tell me 
who signed this letter of yours.” 
“The signature is J. Shelby 
Stevens.” 

Weinbaum switched on the in- 
tercom. “Margaret, look in the 
business register for an outfit 
called Interstellar Information 




These particular orders have only 
been under way to him five days. 
Even if somebody has read them 
on board the ship that’s carrying 
them, they couldn’t possibly be 
sent on to the Three Ghosts any 
faster than they’re traveling 
now.” 

Dana nodded her dark head. 
“All right. Then what are we left 
with but a leak in your head- 
quarters here?” 



and find out who owns it.” 

Dana Lje said, “Aren’t you in- 
terested in the rest of the pre- 
diction?” 

“You bet I am. Does it tell you 
the name of this communications 
device?” 

“Yes,” Dana said. 

“What is it?” 

“The Dirac communicator.” 

Weinbaum groaned and turned 
on the intercom again. “Mar-

garet, send in Dr. Wald. Tell him 
to drop ever3dhing and gallop. 
Any luck with the other thing?” 

“Yes, sir,” the intercom said. 
“It’s a one-man outfit, wholly 
owned by a J. Shelby Stevens, in 
Rico City. It was first registered 
this year.” 

. “Arrest him, on suspicion of 
espionage.” 

door swung open and Dr. 

-*■ Wald came in, all six and a 
half feet of him. He was extreme- 
ly blond, and looked awkward, 
gentle, and not very intelligent. 

“Thor, this young lady is our 
press nemesis, Dana Lje. Dana, 
Dr. Wald is the inventor of the 
Dirac communicator, about which 
you have so damnably much in- 
formation.” 

“It’s out already?" Dr. Wy^ald 
said, scanning the girl with grave 
deliberation. 

“It is, and lots more — lots 
more. Dana, you’re a good girl 
at heart, and for some reason I 
trust you, stupid though it is 
to trust anybody in this job. I 
should detain you until Year 
Day, videocasts or no videocasts. 
Instead, I’m just going to ask 
you to sit on what you’ve got, 
and I’m going to explain why.” 

“Shoot.” 

“I’ve already mentioned how 
slow communication is between 
star and star. We have to carry 
all our letters on ships, just as 



we did locally before the inven- 
tion of the telegraph. The over- 
drive lets us beat the speed of 
light, but not by much of a 
margin over really long distances. 
Do you understand that?” 

“Certainly,” Dana said. She ap- 
peared a bit nettled, and Wein- 
baum decided to give her the full 
dose at a more rapid pace. After 
all, she could be assumed to be 
better informed than the average 
layman. 

“What we’ve needed for a long 
time, then,” he said, “is some 
virtually instantaneous method of 
getting a message from some- 
where to anywhere. Any time lag, 
no matter how small it seems at 
first, has a way of becoming 
major as longer and longer dis- 
tances are involved. Sooner or 
later we must have this instan- 
taneous method, or we won’t be 
able to get messages from one 
system to another fast enough to 
hold our jurisdiction over out- 
lying regions of space.” 

“Wait a minute,” Dana said. 
“I’d always understood that ul- 
trawave is faster than light.” 
“Effectively it is; physically it 
isn’t. You don’t understand 
that?” 

She shook her dark head. 

“In a nutshell,” Weinbaum 
said, “ultrawave is radiation, and 
all radiation in free space is 
limited to the speed of light. The 
way we hype up ultrawave is to 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



use an old application of wave- 
guide theory, whereby the real 
transmission of energy is at light 
speed, but an imaginary thing 
called phase velocity is going 
faster. But the gain in speed of 
transmission isn’t large — ^by ul- 
trawave, for instance, we get a 
message to Alpha Centauri in one 
year instead of nearly four. Over 
long distances, that’s not nearly 
enough extra speed.” 

“Can’t. it be speeded further?” 
she said, frowning. 

“T^O Think of the ultrawave 
-L ’ beam between here and 
Centaurus III as a caterpillar. 
The caterpillar himself is moving 
quite slowly, just at the speed of 
light. But the pulses which pass 
along his body are going forward 
faster than he is — and if you’ve 
ever watched a caterpillar, you’ll 
know that that’s true. But there’s 
a physical limit to the number of 
pulses you can travel along that 
caterpillar, and we’ve already 
reached that limit. We’ve taken 
phase velocity as far as it will go. 

“That’s why we need some- 
thing faster. For a long time our 
relativity theories discouraged 
hope of anything faster— even the 
high phase velocity of a guided 
wave didn’t contradict those 
theories; it just found a limited, 
mathematically imaginary loop- 
hole in them. But when Thor here 
began looking into the question 



of the velocity of propagation of 
a Dirac pulse, he found the an- 
swer. The communicator he de- 
veloped does seem to act over 
long distances, any distance, in- 
stantaneously — and it may wind 
up knocking relativity into a 
cocked hat.” 

The girl’s face was a study in 
stunned realization. “I’m not sure 
I’ve taken in all the technical 
angles,” she said. “But if I’d had 
any notion of the political dyna- 
mite in this thing — ” 

“ — you’d have kept out of my 
office,” Weinbaum said grimly. 
“A good thing you didn’t. The 
Brindisi is carrying a itiodel of 
the Dirac communicator out to 
the periphery for a final test; the 
ship is supposed to get in touch 
with me from out there at a given 
Earth time, which we’ve calcu- 
lated very elaborately to account 
for the residual Lorentz and 
Milne transformations involved in 
overdrive flight, and for a lot 
of other time-phenomena that 
wouldn’t mean anything at all 
to you. 

“If that signal arrives here at 
the given E^rth time, then — aside 
from the havoc it will create 
among the theoretical physicists 
whom we decide to let in on it — 
we will really have our instant 
communicator, and can include 
all of occupied space in the same 
time-zone. And we’ll have a ter- 
rific advantage over any law-

breaker who has to resort to 
ultrawave locally and to letters 
carried by ships over the long 
haul.” 

“Not,” Dr. Wald said sourly, 
“if it’s already leaked out.” 

“It remains to be seen how 
much of it has leaked,” Wein- 
baum said. “The principle is 
rather esoteric, Thor, and the 
name of the thing alone wouldn’t 
mean much even to a trained 
scientist. I gather that Dana’s 
mysterious informant didn’t go 
into technical details ... or did 
he?” 

“No,” Dana said. 

“Tell the truth, Dana. I know 
that you’re suppressing some of 
that letter.” 

The girl started slightly. “All 
right — yes, I am. But nothing 
technical. There’s another part of 
the prediction that lists the num- 
ber and class of ships you will 
send to protect the Brindisi — the 
prediction says they’ll be suffi- 
cient, by the way — and I’m keep- 
ing that to myself, to see whether 
or not it comes true along with 
the rest. If it does, I think I’ve 
hired myself a correspondent.” 

“If it does,” Weinbaum said, 
“you’ve hired yourself a jailbird. 
Let’s see how much mind-reading 
J. Whatsit Stevens can do from 
the sub-cellar of Fort Yaphank.” 
He abruptly ended the conversa- 
tion and ushered Dana Lje out 
with controlled politeness. 



VJ^EINBAUM let himself into 
” Stevens’ cell, locking the 
door behind him and passing the 
keys out to the guard. He sat 
down heavily on the nearest stool. 

Stevens smiled the weak benev- 
olent smile of the very old, and 
laid his book aside on the bunk. 
The book, Weinbaum knew — 
since his office had cleared it — 
was only a volume of pleasant, 
harmless lyrics by a New Dyn- 
asty poet named Nims. 

“Were our predictions correct. 
Captain?” Stevens said. His voice 
was high and musical, rather like 
that of a boy soprano. 

Weinbaum nodded. “You still 
won’t tell us how you did it?” 
“But I already have,” Stevens 
protested. “Our intelligence net- 
work is the best in the Universe, 
Captain. It is superior even to 
your own excellent organization, 
as events have shown.” 

“Its results are superior, that 
I’ll grant,” Weinbaum said glum- 
ly. “If Dana Lje had thrown your 
letter down her disposal chute, 
we would have lost the Brindisi 
and our Dirac transmitter both. 
Incidentally, did your original 
letter predict accurately the num- 
ber of ships we would send?” 
Stevens nodded pleasantly, his 
neatly trimmed white beard 
thrusting forward slightly as he 
smiled. 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“I was afraid so.” Weinbaum 
leaned forward. “Do you have the 
Dirac transmitter, Stevens?” 

“Of course, Captain. How else 
could my correspondents report 
to me with the efficiency you have 
observed?” 

“Then why don’t our receivers 
pick up the broadcasts of your 
agents? Dr. Wald says it’s in- 
herent in the principle that Dirac 
’casts are picked up by all instru- 
ments tuned to receive them, bar 
none. And at this stage of the 
game, there are so few such 
broadcasts being made that we’d 
be almost certain to detect any 
that weren’t coming from our own 
operatives.” 

“I decline to answer that ques- 
tion, if you’ll excuse the im- 
politeness,” Stevens said, his voice 
quavering slightly. “I am an old 
man. Captain, and this intelli- 
gence agency is my sole source 
of income. If I told you how we 
operated, we would no longer 
have any advantage over your 
own service, except for the limited 
freedom from secrecy which we 
have. I have been assured by 
competent lawyers that I have 
every right to operate a private 
investigation bureau, properly 
licensed, upon any scale that I 
may choose; and that I have the 
right to keep my methods secret, 
as the so-called ‘intellectual as- 
sets’ of my firm.. If you wish to 
use our services, well and good. 



We will provide them, with ab- 
solute guarantees on all informa- 
tion we furnish you, for an 
appropriate fee. But our methods 
are our own property.” 

TIOBIN WEINBAUM smiled 
twistedly. “I’m not a naive 
man, Mr. Stevens,” he said. “My 
service is hard on naivete. You 
know as well as I do that the 
government can’t allow you to 
operate on a free-lance basis, sup- 
plying top-secret information to 
anyone who can pay the price, or 
even free of charge to video col- 
umnists on a ‘test’ basis, even 
though you arrive at every jot 
of that information independent- 
ly of espionage — which I still 
haven’t entirely ruled out, by the 
way. If you can duplicate this 
Brindisi performance at. will, we 
will have to have your services 
exclusively. In short, you become 
a hired civilian arm of my own 
bureau.” 

“Quite,” Stevens said, return- 
ing the smile in a fatherly way. 
“We anticipated that, of course. 
However, we have contracts with 
other governments to consider : 
Erskine, in particular. If we are 
to work exclusively for Earth, 
necessarily our price will include 
compensation for renouncing our 
other accounts.” 

“Why should it? Patriotic pub- 
lic servants work for their gov- 
ernment at a loss, if they can’t

work for it any other way.” 

“I am quite aware of that. I 
am quite prepared to renounce 
my other interests. But I do re- 
quire to be paid.” 

‘‘How much?” Weinbaum said, 
suddenly aware that his fists were 
clenched so tightly that they 
hurt. 

Stevens appeared to consider, 
nodding his flowery white poll in 
senile deliberation. “My asso- 
ciates would have to be consulted. 
Tentatively, however, a sum 
equal to the present appropria- 
tion of your bureau would do, 
pending further negotiations.” 
Weinbaum shot to his feet, eyes 
wide. “You old buccaneer! You 
know damned well that I can’t 
spend my entire appropriation on 
a single civilian service! Did it 
ever occur to you that most of 
the civilian outfits working for us 
are on cost-plus contracts, and 
that our civilian executives are 
being paid just a credit a year, 
by their own choice? You’re de- 
manding nearly two thousand 
credits an hour from your own 
government, and claiming the 
legal protection that the govern- 
ment affords you at the same 
time, in order to let those fanatics 
on Erskine run up a higher bid!” 
“The price is not unreason- 
able,” Stevens said. “The service 
is worth the price.” 

“That’s where you’re wrong! 
We have the discoverer of the 



machine working for us. For less 
than half the sum you’re asking, 
we can find the application of the 
device that you’re trading on — of 
that you can be damned sure.” 

“A dangerous gamble, Cap- 
tain.” 

“jpERHAPS. We’ll soon see!” 
Weinbaum glared at the 
placid face. “I’m forced to tell 
you that you’re a free man, Mr. 
Stevens. We’ve been unable to 
show that you came by your in- 
formation by any illegal method. 
You had classified facts in your 
possession, but no classified docu- 
ments, and it’s your privilege as 
a citizen to make guesses, no 
matter how educated. 

“But we’ll catch up with you 
sooner or later. Had you been 
reasonable, you might have found 
yourself in a very good position 
with us, your income as assured 
as any political income can be, 
and your person respected to the 
hilt. Now, however, you’re sub- 
ject to censorship— you have no 
idea how humiliating that can be, 
but I’m going to see to it that 
you find out. There’ll be no more 
newsbeats for Dana Lje, or for 
anyone else. I want to see every 
word of copy that you file with 
any client outside the bureau. 
Every word that is of use to me 
will be used, and you’ll be paid 
the statutory one cent a word 
for it — the same rate that the 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



FBI pays for anonymous gossip. 
Everything I don’t find useful 
will be killed without clearance. 
Eventually we’ll have the modi- 
fication of the Dirac that you’re 
using, and when that happens, 
you’ll be so flat broke that a 
pancake with a hare lip could 
spit right over you.” 

Weinbaum paused for ‘ a mo- 
ment, astonished at his own fury. 

Stevens’ clarinetlike voice be- 
gan to sound in the windowless 
cavity. “Captain, I have no doubt 
that you can do this to me, at 
least incompletely. But it will 
prove fruitless. I will give you a 
prediction, at no charge. It is 
guaranteed, as are all our pre- 
dictions. It is this: You will never 
find that modification. Eventu- 
ally, I will give it to you, on my 
own terms, but you will never 
find it for yourself, nor will you 
force it out of me. In the mean- 
time, not a word of copy will be 
filed with you: for, despite the 
fact that you are an arm of the 
government, I can well afford to 
wait you out.” 

“Bluster,” Weinbaum said. 

“Fact. Yours is the bluster — 
loud talk based on nothing more 
than a hope. I, however, know 
whereof I speak . « . But let us 
conclude this discussion. It serves 
no purpose; you will need to see 
my points made the hard way. 
Thank you for giving me my 
freedom. We will talk again un- 



der different circumstances on — 
let me see; ah, yes, on June 9th 
of the year 2091. That year is, I 
believe, almost upon us.” 

Stevens picked up his book 
again, nodding at Weinbaum, his 
expression harmless and kindly, 
his hands showing the marked 
tremor of paralysis agitans. Wein- 
baum moved helplessly to the 
door and flagged the turnkey. As 
the bars closed behind him, 
Stevens’ voice called out: “Oh, 
yes; and a Happy New Year, 
Captain.” 

W EINBAUM blasted his way 
back into his own office, at 
least twice as mad as the pro- 
verbial nest of hornets, and at the 
same time rather dismally aware 
of his own probable future. If 
Stevens’ second prediction turned 
out to be as phenomenonally ac- 
curate as his first had been, Capt. 
Robin Weinbaum would soon be 
peddling a natty set of second- 
hand uniforms. 

He glared down at Margaret 
Soames, his receptionist. She 
glared right back; she had known 
him too long to be intimidated. 
“Anything?” he said. 

“Dr. Wald’s waiting for you in 
your office. There are some field 
reports, and a couple of Diracs 
on your private tape. Any luck 
with the old codger?” 

“That,” he said crushingly, “is 
Top Secret.” 



BEEP 



21 



“Poof. That means that no- 
body still knows the answer but 
J. Shelby Stevens.” 

He collapsed suddenly. “You’re 
so right. That’s just what it does 
mean. But we’ll bust him wide 
open sooner or later. We’ve ^ot 
to.” 

“You’ll do it,” Margaret said. 
“Anything else for me?” 

“No. Tip off the clerical staff 
that there’s a half-holiday today, 
then go take in a stereo or a 
steak or something yourself. Dr. 
Wald and I have a few private 
wires to pull . and unless I’m 
sadly mistaken, a private bottle 
of aquavit to empty.” 

“Right,” the receptionist said. 
“Tie one on for me, Chief. I un- 
derstand that beer is the best 
chaser for aquavit — I’ll have 
some sent up.” 

“If you should return after I 
am suitably squiffed,” Weinbaum 
said, feeling a little better al- 
ready, “I will kiss you for your 
thoughtfulness. That should keep 
you at your stereo at least twice 
through the third feature.” 

As he went on through the door 
of his own office, she said de- 
murely behind him, “It certainly 
should.” 

As soon as the door closed, 
however, his mood became 
abruptly almost as black as be- 
fore. Despite his comparative 
youth — ^he was now only fifty- 
five — he had been in the service 



a long time, and he needed no 
one to tell him the possible con- 
sequences which might flow from 
possession by a private citizen 
of the Dirac communicator. If 
there was ever to be a Federation 
of Man in the Galaxy, it was 
within the power of J. Shelby 
Stevens to ruin it before it had 
fairly gotten started. And there 
seemed to be nothing at all that 
could be done about it. 

“Hello, Thor,” he said glumly. 
“Pass the bottle.” 

“Hello, Robin. I gather things 
went badly. Tell me about it.” 

B riefly, Weinbaum told 

him. “And the worst of it,” 
he finished; “is that Stevens him- 
self predicts that we won’t find 
the application of the Dirac that 
he’s using, and that eventually 
we’ll have to buy it at his price. 
Somehow I believe him — but I 
can’t see how it’s possible. If I 
were to tell Congress that I was 
going to spend my entire appro- 
priation for a single civilian 
service. I’d be out on my ear 
within the next three sessions.” 
“Perhaps that isn’t his real 
price,” the scientist suggested. “If 
he wants to barter, he’d natur- 
ally begin with a demand miles 
above what he actually wants.” 
“Sure, sure . but frankly, 
Thor, I’d hate to give the old 
reprobate even, a single credit 
if I could get out of it.” Wein-

baum sighed. “Well, let’s see 
what’s come in from the field.’’ 

Thor Wald moved silently 
away from Wainbaum’s desk 
while the officer unfolded it and 
set up the Dirac screen. Stacked 
neatly next to the ultraphone — a 
device Weinbaum had been think- 
ing of, only a few days ago, as 
permanently outmoded — were the 
tapes Margaret had mentioned. 
He fed the first one into the 
Dirac and turned the main toggle 
to the position labeled Start. 

Immediately the whole screen 
went pure white and the audio 
speakers emitted an almost in- 
stantly end-stopped blare of 
sound — a beep which, as Wein- 
baum already knew, made up a 
continuous spectrum from about 
30 cycles per second to well above 
18,000 cps. Then both the light 
and the noise were gone as if 
they had never been, and were 
replaced by the familiar face and 
voice of Weinbaum’s local ops 
chief in Rio City. 

“There’s nothing unusual in 
the way of transmitters in Stev- 
ens’ officers here,” the operative 
said without preamble. “And 
there isn’t any local Interstellar 
Information staff, except for one 
stenographer, and she’s as dumb 
as they come. About all we could 
get from her is that Stevens is 
‘such a sweet old man.’ No pos- 
sibility that she’s faking it; she’s 
genuinely stupid, the kind that 



thinks Betelgevse is something 
Indians use to darken their skins. 
We looked for some sort of list 
or code table that would give us 
a line on Stevens’ field staff, but 
that was another dead end. Now 
we’re maintaining a 24-hour 
Dinwiddie watch on the place 
from a joint across the street. 
Orders?” 

Weinbaum dictated to the 
blank stretch of tape which fol- 
lowed: “Margaret, next time you 
send any Dirac tapes in here, cut 
that damnable beep off them first. 
Tell the boys in Rico City that 
Stevens has been released, and 
that I’m proceeding for an Order 
In Security to tap his ultraphone 
and his local lines — this is one 
case where I’m sure we can per- 
suade the court that tapping’s 
necessary. Also — and be damned 
sure you code this — tell them to 
proceed with the tap immediately 
and to maintain it regardless of 
whether or not the court okays it. 
I’ll thumbprint a Full Respon- 
sibility Confession for them. We 
can’t afford to play patty-cake 
with Stevens — the potential is 
just too damned big. And oh, 
yes, Margaret, send the message 
by carrier, and send out general 
orders to everybody concerned 
not to use the Dirac again ex- 
cept when distance and time rule 
every other medium out. Stevens 
has already admitted that he can 
receive Dirac ’casts.”

TTE put down the mike and 
stared morosely for a mo- 
ment at the beautiful Eridanean 
scrollwood of his desktop. Wald 
coughed inquiringly and retrieved 
the aquavit. 

“Excuse me, Robin,” he said, 
“but I should think that would 
work both ways.” 

“So should I. And yet the fact 
is that we’ve never picked up so 
much as a whisper from either 
Stevens or his agents. I can’t 
think of any way that could be 
pulled, but evidently it can.” 
“Well, let’s rethink the prob- 
lem, and see what we get,” Wald 
said. “I didn’t want to say so in 
front of the young lady, for ob- 
vious reasons — I mean Miss Lje, 
of course, not Margaret — ^but the 
truth is that the Dirac is essen- 
tially a simple mechanism in 
principle. I seriously doubt that 
there’s any way to transmit a 
message from it which can’t be 
detected — and an examination of 
the theory with that proviso in 
mind might give us something 
new.” 

“What proviso?” Weinbaum 
said. Thor Wald left him behind 
rather often these days. 

“Why, that a Dirac transmis- 
sion doesn’t necessarily go to all 
communicators capable of receiv- 
ing it. If that’s true, then the 
reasons why it is true should 
emerge from the theory.” 

“I see^ Okay, proceed on that 



line. I’ve been looking at Stevens’ 
dossier while you were talking, 
and it’s an absolute desert. Prior 
to the opening of the office in 
Rico City, there’s no dope what- 
ever on J. Shelby Stevens. The 
man as good as rubbed my nose 
in the fact that he’s using a pseud 
when I first talked to him. I 
asked him what the ‘J’ in his 
name stood for, and he said, ‘Oh, 
let’s make it Jerome.’ But who 
the man behind the pseud is — ” 

“Is it possible that he’s using 
his own initials?” 

“No,” Weinbaum said. “Only 
the dumbest ever do that, or 
transpose syllables, or retain any 
connection at all with their real 
names. Those are the people who 
are in serious emotional trouble, 
people who drive themselves into 
anonymity, but leave clues 
strewn all around the landscape 
— those clues are really a cry 
for help, for discovery. Of course 
we’re working on that angle — we 
can’t neglect anything — but J. 
Shelby Stevens isn’t that kind of 
case. I’m sure.” Weinbaum stood 
up abruptly. “Okay, Thor-j- 
what’s first on your technical pro- 
gram?” 

“Well . I suppose we’ll have 
to start with checking the fre- 
quencies we use. We’re going on 
Dirac’s assumption — and it works 
very well, and always has — that 
a positron in motion through a 
crystal lattice is accompanied by 



24 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



V 



de Broglie waves which are trans- 
forms of the waves of an electron 
in motion somewhere else in the 
Universe. Thus if we control the 
frequency and path of the posi- 
tron, we control the placement of 
the electron — we cause it to ap- 
pear, so to speak, in the circuits 
of a communicator somewhere 
else. After that, reception is just 
a matter of amplifying the bursts 
and reading the signal.” 

W ALD scowled and shook his 
blond head. ‘Tf Stevens is 
getting out messages which we 
don’t pick up, my first assump- 
tion would be that he’s worked 
out a fine-tuning circuit that’s 
more delicate than ours, and is 
more or less sneaking his mes- 
sages under ours. The only way 
that could be done, as far as I 
can see at the moment, is by 
something really fantastic in the 
way of exact frequency control 
of his positron-gun. If so, the 
logical step for us is to go back 
to the beginning of our tests and 
re-run our diffractions to see if 
we can refine our measurements 
of positron frequencies.” 

The scientist looked so inex- 
pressibly gloomy as he offered 
this conclusion that a pall of 
hopelessness settled over Wein- 
baum in sheer sympathy. “You 
don’t look as if you expected that 
to uncover anything new.” 

“I don’t. You see, Robin, 



things are different in physics 
now than they used to be in 
the Twentieth Century. In those 
days, it \yas always presupposed 
that physics was limitless — the 
classic statement was made by 
Weyl, who said that ‘It is the 
nature of a real thing to be in- 
exhaustible in content.’ We know 
now that that’s not so, except in 
a remote, associational sort of 
way. Nowadays, physics is a de- 
fined and self -limited science; its 
scope is still prodigious, but we 
can no longer think of it as end- 
less. 

“This is better established in 
particle physics than in any other 
branch of the science. Half of the 
trouble physicists of the last cen- 
tury had with Euclidean geom- 
etry — and hence the reason why 
they evolved so many recompli- 
cated theories of relativity — is 
that it’s a geometry of lines, and 
thus can be subdivided infinitely. 
When Cantor proved that there 
really ■ is an infinity, at least 
mathematically speaking, that 
seemed to clinch the case for the 
possibility of a really infinite 
physical universe, too.” 

Wald’s eyes grew vague, and 
he paused to gulp down a slug 
of the licorice-flavored aquavit 
which would have, made Wein- 
baum’s every hair ^tand on end. 

“I remember,” Wald said, “the 
man who taught me theory of 
sets at Princeton, many years. 



BEEP 



25 



ago. He used to say; ‘Cantor 
teaches us that there are many 
kinds of infinities.’ There was a 
crazy old man!” 

Weinbaum rescued the bottle 
hastily. “So go on, Thor.” 

“Oh.” Wald blinked. “Yes. 
Well, what we know now is that 
the geometry which applies to 
ultimate particles, like the posi- 
tron, isn’t Euclidean at all. It’s 
Pythagorean — a geometry of 
points, not lines. Once you’ve 
measured one of those points, 
and it doesn’t matter what kind 
of quantity you’re measuring, 
you’re down as far as you can 
go. At that point, the Universe 



becomes discontinuous, and no 
further refinement is possible. 

“And I’d say that our positron- 
frequency measurements have al- 
ready gotten that far down. There 
isn’t another element in the Uni- 
verse denser than plutonium, yet 
we get the same frequency-values 
by diffraction through plutonium 
crystals that We get through 
osmium crystals — there’s not the 
slightest difference. If J. Shelby 
Stevens is operating in terms of 
fractions of those values, then 
he’s doing what an organist 
would call ‘playing in the cracks’ 
— which is certainly something 
you can think about doing, but 




26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



something that’s in actuality im- 
possible to do. Hoop.” 

“Hoop?” Weinbaum said. 
“Sorry. A hiccup only.” 

“Oh. Well, maybe Stevens has 
rebuilt the organ?” 

“If he has rebuilt the metrical 
frame of the Universe to accom- 
modate a private skip-tracing 
firm,” Wald said firmly, “I for 
one see no reason why we can’t 
counter-check him — hoop — by 
declaring the whole cosmos null 
and void.” 

“All right, all right,” Wein- 
baum said, grinning. “I didn’t 
mean to push your analogy right 
over the edge — I was just ask- 



ing. But let’s get to work on it 
anyhow. We can’t just sit here 
and let Stevens get away with it. 
If this frequency angle turns out 
to be as hopeless as it seems, 
we’ll try something else.” 

Wald eyed the aquavit bottle 
owlishly. “It’s a very pretty prob- 
lem,” he said. “Have I ever sung 
you the song we have in Sweden 
called ‘Nat-og-Dag?’ ” 

“Hoop,” Weinbaum said, to his 
own surprise, in a high falsetto. 
“Excuse me. No. Let’s hear it.” 

nPHE computer occupied an en- 
tire floor of the Security build- 
ing, its seemingly identical banks

27 





laid out side by side on the floor 
along an advanced pathological 
state of Peano’s “space-filling 
curve.” At the current business 
end of the line was a master con- 
trol board with a large tele- 
vision screen at its center, at 
which Dr. Wald was stationed, 
with Weinbaum looking, silently 
but anxiously, over his shoulder. 

The screen itself showed a pat- 
tern which, except that it was 
drawn in green light against a 
dark gray background, strongly 
resembled the grain in a piece of 
highly polished mahogany. Pho- 
tographs of similar patterns were 
stacked on a small table to Dr. 
Wald’s right; several had spilled 
over onto the floor. 

“Well, there it is,” Wald sighed 
at length. “And I won’t struggle 
to keep myself from saying ‘I 
told you so.’ What you’ve had 
me do here, Robin, is to recon- 
firm about half the basic postu- 
la.tes of particle physics — which 
is why it took so long, even 
though it was the first project we 
started.” He snapped off the 
screen. “There are no cracks for 
J. Shelby to play in. That’s 
definite.” 

“If you’d said ‘That’s flat,’ you 
would have made a joke,” Wein- 
baum said sourly. “Look . 
isn’t there still a chance of error? 
If not on your part, Thor, then 
in the computer? After all, it’s 
set up to work only with the unit 



charges of modern physics; 
mightn’t we have to disconnect 
the banks that contain that bias 
before the machine will follow 
the fractional -charge instructions 
we give it?” 

“Disconnect, he says,” Wald 
groaned, mopping his brow re- 
flectively. “The bias exists every- 
where in the machine, my friend, 
because it functions everywhere 
on those same unit charges. It 
wasn’t a matter of subtracting 
banks; we had to add one with a 
bias all its own, to counter-cor- 
rect the corrections the computer 
would otherwise apply to the 
instructions. The technicians 
thought I was crazy. Now, five 
months later, I’ve proved it.” 

Weinbaum grinned in spite of 
himself. “What about the other 
projects?” 

“All done — some time back, as 
a matter of fact. The staff and I 
checked every single Dirac tape 
we’ve received since you released 
J. Shelby from Yaphank, for any 
sign of intermodulation, marginal 
signals, or anything else of the 
kind. There’s nothing, Robin, ab- 
solutely nothing. That’s our net 
result, all around.” 

“Which leaves us just where 
we started,” Weinbaum said. “All 
the monitoring projects came to 
the same dead end; I strongly 
suspect that Stevens hasn’t risked 
any further calls from his home 
office to his field staff, even 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



though he seemed confident that 
we’d never intercept such calls — 
as we haven’t. Even our local 
wiretapping hasn’t turned up 
anything but calls by Stevens’ 
secretary, making appointments 
for him with various clients, ac- 
tual and potential. Any informa- 
tion he’s selling these days he’s 
passing on in person — and not 
in his office, either, because we’ve 
got bugs planted all over that 
and haven’t heard a thing.” 
“That must limit his range of 
operation enormously,” Wald ob- 
jected. 

W EINBAUM nodded. “With- 
out a doubt — but he shows 
no signs of being bothered by 
it. He can’t have sent any tips 
to Erskine recently, for instance, 
because our last tangle with that 
crew came out very well for us, 
even though we had to use the 
Dirac to send the orders to our 
squadron out there. If he over- 
heard us, he didn’t even try to 
pass the word. Just as he said, 
he’s sweating us out — ” Wein- 
baum paused. “Wait a minute, 
here comes Margaret. And by the 
length of her stride. I’d say she’s 
got something particularly nasty 
on her mind.” 

“You bet I do,” Margaret 
Soames said vindictively. “And 
it’ll blow plenty of lids around 
here, or I miss my guess. The 
I.D. squad has finally pinned 



down J. Shelby Stevens. They 
did it with the voice-comparator 
alone.” 

“How does that work?” Wald 
said interestedly. 

“Blink microphone,” Wein- 
baum said impatiently. “Isolates 
inflections on single, normally 
stressed syllables and matches 
them. Standard I.D. searching 
technique, on a case of this kind, 
but it takes so long that we usu- 
ally get the quarry by other 
means before it pays off. Well, 
don’t stand there like a dummy, 
Margaret. Who is he?” 

“ ‘He,’ ” Margaret said, “is 
your sweetheart of the video 
waves. Miss Dana Lje.” 

“They’re crazy!” Wald said, 
staring at her. 

Weinbaum came slowly out of 
his first shock of stunned disbe- 
lief. “No, Thor,” he said finally. 
“No, it figures. If a woman is go- 
ing to go in for disguises, there 
are always two she can assume 
outside her own sex; a young 
boy, and a very old man. And 
Dana’s an actress; that’s no news 
to us.” 

“But — but why did she do it, 
Robin?” 

“That’s what we’re going to 
find out right now. So we 
wouldn’t get the Dirac modifica- 
tion by ourselves, eh! Well, there 
are other ways of getting an- 
swers besides particle physics. 
Margaret, do you have a pick-up 



BEEP 



29 



order out for that girl?” 

“No,” the receptionist said. 
“This is one chestnut I wanted 
to see you pull out for yourself. 
You give me the authority, and 
I send the order — not before.” 
“Spiteful child. Send it, then, 
and glory in my gritted teeth. 
Come on, Thor — let’s put the 
nutcracker on this chestnut.” 

As they were leaving the com- 
puter floor, Weinbaum stopped 
suddenly in his tracks and began 
to mutter in an almost inaudible 
voice. 

Wald said, “What’s the matter, 
Robin?” 

“Nothing. I keep being brought 
up short by those predictions. 
What’s the date?” 

“M’m . June 9th. Why?” 
“It’s the exact date that 
‘Stevens’ predicted we’d meet 
again, damn it! Something tells 
me that this isn’t going to be as 
simple as it looks.” 

TF Dana Lje had any idea of 
what she was in for — and con- 
sidering the fact that she was 
‘J. Shelby Stevens’ it had to be 
assumed that she did — the knowl- 
edge seemed not to make her at 
all fearful. She sat as composedly 
as ever before Weinbaum’s desk, 
smoking her eternal cigarette, 
and waited, one dimpled knee 
pointed directly at the bridge of 
the officer’s nose. 

“Dana,” Weinbaum said, “this 



time we’re going to get all the 
answers, and we’re not going to 
be gentle about it. Just in case 
you’re not aware of the fact, there 
are certain laws relating to giving 
false information to a security 
officer, under which we could 
heave you in prison for a mini- 
mum of fifteen years. By applica- 
tion of the statutes on using 
communications to defraud, plus 
various local laws against trans- 
vestism, pseudonymity and so on, 
we could probably pile up enough 
additional short sentences to keep 
you in Yaphank until you really 
do grow a beard. So I’d advise 
you to open up.’I 

“I have every intention of 
opening up,” Dana said. “I know, 
practically word for word, how 
this interview is going to proceed, 
what information I’m going to 
give you, just when I’m going to 
give it to you-^and what you’re 
going to pay me for it. I knew 
all that .many months ago. So 
there would be no point in my 
holding out on you.” 

“What you’re saying. Miss 
Lje,” Thor Wald said in a re- 
signed voice, “is that the future is 
fixed, and that you can read it, 
in every essential detail.” 

“Quite right. Dr. Wald. Both 
those things are true.” 

There was a brief silence. 

“All right,” Weinbaum said 
grimly. “Talk.” 

“All right. Captain Weinbaum, 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



pay me,” Dana said calmly. 

Weinbaum snorted. 

“But I’m quite serious,” she 
said. “You still don’t know what 
I know about the Dirac com- 
municator. I won’t be forced to 
tell it, by threat of prison or by 
any other threat. You see, I 
know for a fact that you aren’t 
going to send me to prison, or 
give me drugs, or do anything 
else of that kind. I know for a 
fact, instead, that you are going 
to pay me — so I’d be very foolish 
to say a word until you do. After 
all, it’s quite a secret you’re buy- 
ing. Once I tell you what it is, 
you and the entire service will, 
be able to read the future as I 
do, and then the information will 
be valueless to me.” 

Weinbaum was completely 
speechless for a moment. Finally 
he said, “Dana, you have a heart 
of purest brass, as well as a knee 
with an invisible gunsight on it. 

I say that I’m not going to give 
you my appropriation, regardless 
of what the future may or may 
not say about it. I’m not going 
to give it to you because the way 
my Government — and yours — 
runs things makes such a price 
impossible. Or is that really your 
price?” 

“It’s my real price . but it’s 
also an alternative. Call it my 
second choice. My first choice, 
which means the price I’d settle 
for, comes in two parts: (a), to 



be taken into your service as a 
responsible officer; and, (b), to 
be married to Capt. Robin Wein- 
baum.” 

Wl^EINBAUM sailed up out of 
his chair. He felt as though 
copper-colored flames a foot long 
were shooting out of each of his 
ears. 

“Of all the — ” he began. There 
his voice failed completely. 

From behind him, where Wald 
was standing, came something 
like a large, Scandanavian-model 
guffaw being choked into insen- 
sibility. 

Dana herself seemed to be smil- 
ing a little. 

“You see,” she said, “I don’t 
point my best and most accurate 
knee at every man I meet.” 

Weinbaum sat down again, 
slowly and carefully. “Walk, do 
not run, to nearest exit,” he said. 
“Women and childlike security 
officers first. Miss Lje, are you 
trying to sell me the notion that 
you went through this elaborate 
hanky-panky — beard and all — 
out of a burning passion for my 
dumpy and underpaid person?” 

“Not entirely,” Dana Lje said. 
“I want to be in the bureau, too, 
as I said. Let me confront you, 
though. Captain, with a fact of 
life that doesn’t seem to have oc- 
curred to you at all. Do you ac- 
cept as a fact that I can read the 
future in detail, and that that, to 



BEEP 



31 



be possible at all, means that the 
future is fixed?” 

“Since Thor seems able to ac- 
cept it, I suppose I can too — 
provisionally.” 

“There’s nothing provisional 
about it,” Dana said firmly. 
“Now, when I first came upon 
this — uh, this gimmick — quite a 
while back, one of the -first things 
that I found out was that I was 
going to go through the ‘J. Shelby 
Stevens’ masquerade, force my- 
self onto the staff of the bureau, 
and marry you, Robin. At the 
time, I was both astonished and 
completely rebellious. I didn’t 
want to be on the bureau staff; 
I liked my free-lance life as a 
video commentator. I didn’t want 
to marry you, though I wouldn’t 
have been averse to living with 
you for a while — say a month or 
so. And above all, the masquerade 
struck me as ridiculous. 

“But the facts kept staring me 
in the face. I was going to do all 
those things. There were no al- 
ternatives, no fanciful ‘branches 
of time,’ no decision-points that 
might be altered to make the 
future change. My future, like 
yours. Dr. Wald’s, and every- 
one else’s, was fixed. It didn’t 
matter a snap whether or not I 
had a decent motive for what I 
was going to do; I was going to 
do it anyhow. Cause and effect, 
as I could see for myself, just 
don’t exist. One event follows 



another because events are just 
as indestructible in space-time as 
matter and energy are. 

“It was the bitterest of all pills. 
It will take me many years to 
swallow it completely, and you 
too. Dr. Wald will come around 
a little sooner, I think. At any 
rate, once I was intellectually 
convinced that all this was so, I 
had to protect my own sanity. I 
knew that I couldn’t alter what 
I was going to do, but the least I 
could do to protect myself was 
to suppjy myself with motives. 
Or, in other words, just plain 
rationalizations. That much, it 
seems, we’re free to do; the con- 
sciousness of the observer is just 
along for the ride through time, 
and can’t alter events — ^but it can 
comment, explain, invent. That’s 
fortunate, for none of us could 
stand going through motions 
which were truly free of what 
we think of as personal signifi- 
cances. 

“So I supplied myself with the 
obvious motives. Since I was go- 
ing to be married to you and 
couldn’t get out of it, I set out 
to convince myself that I loved 
you. Now I do. Since I was going 
to join the bureau staff, I thought 
over all the advantages that it 
might have over video commen- 
tating, and found that they made 
a respectable list. Those are my 
motives. 

“But I had no such motives at 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the beginning. Actually, there are 
never motives behind actions. All 
actions are fixed. What we called 
motives evidently are rationaliza- 
tions by the helpless observing 
consciousness, which is intelligent 
enough to smell an event coming 
— and, since it cannot avert the 
event, instead cooks up reasons 
for wanting it to happen.” 

“Wow,” Dr. Wald said, inele- 
gantly but with considerable 
force. 

“THITHER ‘wow’ or ‘balder- 
dash’ seems to be called for 
— I can’t quite decide which,” 
Weinbaum agreed. “We know 
that Dana is an actress, Thor, 
so let’s not fall off the apple tree 
quite yet. Dana, I’ve been saving 
the really hard question for the 
last. That question is; How? 
How did you arrive at this modi- 
fication of the Dirac transmitter? 
Remember, we know your back- 
ground, where we didn’t know 
that of ‘J. Shelby Stevens.’ 
You’re not a scientist. There 
were some fairly high-powered 
intellects among your distant rel- 
atives, but that’s as close as you 
come.” 

“I’m going to give you several 
answers to that question,” Dana 
Lje said. “Pick the one you like 
best. They’re all true, but they 
tend to contradict each other here 
and there. 

“To begin with,, you’re right 



about my relatives, of course. If 
you’ll check your dossier again, 
though, you’ll discover that those 
so-called ‘distant’ relatives were 
the last surviving members of my 
family besides myself. When they 
died, second and fourth and ninth 
cousins though they were, their 
estates reverted to me, and among 
their effects I found a sketch of a 
possible instantaneous communi- 
cator based on de Broglie -wave 
inversion. The material was in 
very rough form, and mostly be- 
yond my comprehension, because 
I am, as you say, no scientist 
myself. But I was interested; I 
could see, dimly, what such a 
thing might be worth — and not 
only in money. 

“My interest was fanned by 
two coincidences — ^the kind of 
coincidences that cause-and-effect 
just can’t allow, but which seem 
to happen all the same in the 
world of unchangeable events. 
For most of my adult life. I’ve 
been in communications indus- 
tries of one kind or another, mostly 
branches of video. I had com- 
munications equipment around 
me constantly, and I had coffee 
and doughnuts with communica- 
tions engineers every day. First 
I picked up the jargon; then, 
some of the procedures; and 
eventually, a little real knowl- 
edge. Some of the things I learned 
can’t be gotten any other way. 
Some other things are ordinarily 



BEEP

available only to highly educated 
people like Dr. Wald here, and 
came to me by accident, in horse- 
play, between kisses, and a hun- 
dred other ways — all natural to 
the environment of a video net- 
work.” 

Weinbaum found, to his own 
astonishment, that the “between 
kisses” clause did not sit very 
well in his chest. He said, 
with unintentional brusqueness ; 
“What’s the other coincidence?” 
“A leak in your own staff.” 
“Dana, you ought to have that 
set to music.” 

“Suit yourself.” 

“I can’t suit myself,” Wein- 
baum said petulantly. “I work 
for the Government. Was this 
leak direct to you?” 

“Not at first. That was why I 
kept insisting to you in person 
that there might be such a leak, 
and why I finally began to hint 
about it in public, on rhy pro- 
gram. I was hoping that you’d 
be able to seal it up inside the 
bureau beforje my first rather ten- 
uous contact with it got lost. 
When I didn’t succeed in pro- 
voking you into protecting your- 
self, I took the risk of making 
direct contact with the leak my- 
self — and the first piece of secret 
information that came to me 
through it was the final point I 
needed to put my Dirac com- 
municator together. When it was 
all assembled, it did more than 



just communicate. It predicted. 
And I can tell you why.” 

W EINBAUM said thoughtful- 
ly, “I don’t find this very 
hard to accept, so far. Pruned of 
the philosophy, it even makes 
some sense of the ‘J. Shelby 
Stevens’ affair. I assume that by 
letting the old gentleman be- 
come known as somebody who 
knew more about the Dirac trans- 
mitter than I did, and who wasn’t 
averse to negotiating with any- 
body who had money, you kept 
the leak working through you — 
rather than transmitting data di- 
rectly to unfriendly govern- 
ments.” 

“It did work out that way,” 
Dana said. “But that wasn’t the 
genesis or the purpose of the 
Stevens masquerade. I’ve al- 
ready given you the whole ex- 
planation of how that came 
about.” 

“Well, you’d better name me 
that leak, before the man gets 
away.” 

“When the price is paid, not 
before. It’s too late to prevent a 
getaway, anyhow. In the mean- 
time, Robin, I want to go on 
and tell you the other answer to 
your question about how I was 
able to find this particular Dirac 
secret, and you didn’t. What an- 
swers I’ve given you up to now 
have been cause-and-effect an- 
swers, with which we’re all more 



34 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



comfortable. But I want to im- 
press on you that all apparent 
cause-and-effect relationships are 
accidents. There is no such thing 
as a cause, and no such thing 
as an effect. I found the secret 
because I found it; that event 
was fixed; that certain circum- 
stances seem to explain why I 
found it, in the old cause-and- 
effect terms, is irrelevant. Simi- 
larly, with all your superior 
equipment and brains, you didn’t 
find it for one reason, and one 
reason alone: becatise you didn’t 
find it. The history of the future 
says you didn’t.” 

“I pays my money and I takes 
no choice, eh?” Weinbaum said 
ruefully. 

“I’m afraid so— and I don’t 
like it any better than you do.” 

“Thor, what’s your opinion of 
all this?” 

“It’s just faintly flabbergast- 
ing,” Wald said soberly. “How- 
ever, it hangs together. The de- 
terministic Universe which Miss 
Lje paints was a common feature 
of the old relativity theories, and 
as sheer speculation has an even 
longer history. I would say that 
in the long run, how much cre- 
dence we place in the story as a 
whole will rest upon her method 
of, as she calls it, reading the 
future. If it is demonstrable be- 
yond any doubt, then the rest 
becofiies perfectly credible — phi- 
losophy and all. If it doesn’t, then 



what remains is an admirable job 
of acting, plus some metaphysics 
which, while self-consistent, are 
not original with Miss Lje.” 

“That sums up the case as well 
as if I’d coached you. Dr. Wald,” 
Dana said. “I’d like to point out 
one more thing. If I can read the 
future, then ‘J. Shelby Stevens’ 
never had any need for a staff of 
field operatives, and he never 
needed to send a single Dirac 
message which you might inter- 
cept. All he needed to do was to 
make predictions from his read- 
ings, which he knew to be infal- 
lible; no private espionage 
network had to be involved.” 

“I see that,” Weinbaum said 
dryly. “All right, Dana, let’s put 
the proposition this way; I do 
not believe you. Much of what 
you say is probably true, but in 
totality I believe it to be false. 
On the other hand, if you’re tell- 
ing the whole truth, you certainly 
deserve a place on the bureau 
staff — it would be dangerous as 
hell not to have you with us — an^ 
the marriage is a more or less mi- 
nor matter, except to you and me. 
You can have that with no strings 
attached; I don’t want to be 
bought, any more than you 
would. 

“So: if you will tell me where 
the leak is, we will consider that 
part of the question closed. I 
make that condition not as a 
price, but because I don’t want 



BEEP 



35 



to get myself engaged to some- 
body who might be shot as a spy 
within a month.” 

“Fair enough,” Dana said. 
“Robin, your leak is Margaret 
Soames. She is an Erskine opera- 
tive, and nobody’s bubble-brain. 
She’s a highly trained techni- 
cian.” 

“Well, I’ll be damned,” Wein- 
baum said in astonishment. 
“Then she’s already flown the 
coop — she was the one who first 
told me we’d identified you. She 
must have taken on that job in 
order to hold up delivery long 
enough to stage an exit.” 

“That’s right. But you’ll catch 
her, day after tomorrow. And you 
are now a hooked fish, Robin.” 
There was another suppressed 
burble from Thor Wald. 

“I accept the fate happily,” 
Weinbaum said, eying the gun- 
sight knee. “Now, if you will tell 
me how you work your swami 
trick, and if it backs up every- 
thing you’ve said to the letter, as 
you claim. I’ll see to it that you’re 
also taken into the bureau and 
that all charges against you are 
quashed. Otherwise, I’ll probably 
have to kiss the bride between 
the bars of a cell.” 

Dana smiled. “The secret is 
very simple. It’s in the beep.” 

W EINBAUM’S jaw dropped. 

“The beep? The Dirac 
noise?” 



“That’s right. You didn’t find 
it out because you considered the 
beep to be just a nuisance, and 
ordered Miss Soames to cut it 
off all tapes before sending them 
in to you. Miss Soames, who had 
some inkling of what the beep 
meant, was more than happy to 
do so, leaving the reading of the 
beep exclusively to ‘J. Shelby 
Stevens’ — ^who she thought was 
going to take on Erskine as a 
client.” 

“Explain,” Thor Wald said, 
looking intense. 

“Just as you assumed, every 
Dirac message that is sent is 
picked up by every receiver that 
is capable of detecting it. Every 
receiver — including the first one 
ever built, which is yours. Dr. 
Wald, through the hundreds of 
thousands of them which will 
exist throughout the Galaxy in 
the Twenty-Fourth Century, to 
the untold millions which will 
exist in the Thirtieth Century, 
and so on. The Dirac beep is 
the simultaneous reception of 
every one of the Dirac messages 
which have ever been sent, or ever 
will be sent. Incidentally, the 
cardinal number of the total of 
those messages is a relatively 
small and of course finite num- 
ber; it’s far below really large 
finite numbers such as the num- 
ber of electrons in the Universe, 
even when you break each and 
every message down into indivi- 



36 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



dual ‘bits’ and count those.” 

“Of course,” Dr. Wald said 
softly. “Of course! But, Miss 
Lje . how do you tune for an 
individual message? We tried 
fractional positron frequencies, 
and got nowhere.” 

“I didn’t even know fractional 
positron frequencies existed,” 
Dana confessed. “No, -it’s simple 
— so simple that a lucky layman 
like me could arrive at it. You 
tune individual messages out of 
the beep by time-lag, nothing 
more. All the messages arrive at 
the same instant, in the smallest 
fraction of time that exists, some- 
thing called a ‘chronon.’ ” 

“Yes,” Wald said. “The time 
it takes one electron to move 
from one quantum-level to an- 
other. That’s the Pythagorean 
point of time-measurement.” 
“Thank you. Obviously no 
gross physical receiver can re- 
spond to a message that brief, or 
at least that’s what I thought at 
first. But because there are re- 
lay and switching delays, vari- 
ous forms of feedback and so on 
in the apparatus itself, the beep 
arrives at the output end as a 
complex pulse which has been 
‘splattered’ along the time axis 
for a full second or more. That’s 
an effect which you can exagger- 
ate by recording the ‘splattered’ 
beep on a high-speed tape, the 
same way you would record any 
event that you wanted to study 



in slow motion. Then you tune 
up the various failure -points in 
your receiver, to exaggerate one 
failure, minimize all the others, 
and use noiSe -suppressing tech- 
niques to cut out the back- 
ground.” 

rpHOR WALD frowned. “You’d 
-*■ still have a considerable gar- 
ble when you were through. 
You’d have to sample the mes- 
sages — ” 

“Which is just what I did; 
Robin’s little lecture to me about 
the ultrawave gave me that hint. 
I set myself to find out how the 
ultrawave channel carries so 
many messages at once, and I 
discovered that you people sam- 
ple the incoming pulses every 
thousandth of a second and pass 
on one pip only when the wave 
deviates in a certain way from 
the mean. I didn’t really believe 
it would work on the Dirac beep, 
but it turned out just as well: 
90'/r as intelligible as the origi- 
nal transmission after- it came 
through the smearing device. I’d 
already got enough from the beep 
to put my plan in motion, of 
course — but now every voice mes- 
sage in it was available, and crys- 
tal-clear: If you select three pips 
every thousandth of a second, you 
can even pick up an intelligible 
transmission of music — a little 
razzy, but good enough to iden- 
tify the instruments that are 



BEEP 



37 



playing — and that’s a very close 
test of any communications de- 
vice.” 

“There’s a question of detail 
here that doesn’t quite follow,” 
said Weinbaum, for whom the 
technical talk was becoming a 
little too thick to fight through. 
“Dana, you say that you knew 
the course this conversation was 
going to take — yet it isn’t being 
Dirac-recorded, nor can I see any 



reason why any summary of it 
would be sent out on the Dirac 
afterwards.” 

“That’s true, Robin. However, 
when I leave here, I will make 
such a transcast myself, on my 
own Dirac. Obviously I will — be- 
cause I’ve a/ready picked it up, 
from the beep.” 

“In other words, you’re going 
to call yourself up — months ago.” 
“That’s it,” Dana said. “It’s 




38 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



not as useful a technique as you 
might think at first, because it’s 
dangerous to make such broad- 
casts while a situation is still de- 
veloping. You can safely ‘phone 
back’ details only after the given 
situation has gone to completion, 
as a chemist might put it. Once 
you know, however, that when 
you use the Dirac you’re dealing 
with time, you can coax some 
very strange things out of the in- 
strument.” 

She paused and smiled. “I have 
heard,” she said conversational- 
ly, “the voice of the President of 
our Galaxy, in 3480, announcing 
the federation of the Milky Way 
and the Magellanic Clouds. I’ve 
heard the commander of a world- 
line cruiser, traveling from 8873 
to 8704 along the - world-line of 
the planet Hathshepa, which cir- 
cles a star on the rim of NGC 
4725, calling for help across elev- 
en million light-years — but what 
kind of help he was calling for, 
or will be calling for, is beyond 
my comprehension. And many 
other things. When you check on 
me, you’ll hear these things too — 
and you’ll wonder what many of 
them mean. 

“And you’ll listen to them even 
more closely than I did, in the 
hope of finding out whether or 
not anyone was able to under- 
stand in time to help.” 

Weinbaum and Wald looked 
dazed. 



TTER voice became a little more 
somber. “Most of the voices 
in the Dirac beep are like that — 
they’re cries for help, which you 
can overhear decades or centu- 
ries before the senders get into 
trouble. You’ll feel obligated to 
answer every one, to try to supply 
the help that’s needed. And you’ll 
listen to the succeeding messages 
and say: ‘Did we — will we get 
there in time? Did we understand 
in time?’ 

“And in most cases you won’t 
be sure. You’ll know the future, 
but not what most of it means. 
The farther into the future you 
travel with the machine, the more 
incomprehensible the messages 
become, and so you’re reduced to 
telling yourself that time will, 
after all, have to pass by at its 
own pace, before enough of the 
surrounding events can emerge 
to make those remote messages 
clear. 

“The long run effect, as far as 
I can think it through, is not go- 
ing to be that of omniscience — of 
our consciousness being extracted 
entirely from the time-stream and 
allowed to view its whole sweep 
from one side. Instead, the Dirac 
in effect simply slides the bead 
of consciousness forward from 
the present a certain distance. 
Whether it’s five hundred or five 
thousand years still remains to 
be seen. At that point the law of 
diminishing returns sets in — or 



BEEP 



39 



the noise-factor begins to over- 
balance the information, take 
your choice — and the observer is 
reduced to traveling in time at 
the same old speed. He’s just a 
bit ahead of himself.” 

‘‘You’ve thought a great deal 
about this,” Wald said slowly. “I 
dislike to think of what might 
have happened had some less 
conscientious person stumbled on 
the beep.” 

“That wasn’t in the cards,” 
Dana said. 

In the ensuing quiet, Wein- 
baum felt a faint, irrational sense 
of let-down, of something which 
had promised more than had been 
delivered — rather like the taste of 
fresh bread as compared to its 
smell, or the discovery that Thor 
Wald’s Swedish “folk-song” Nat- 
og-Dag was only Cole Porter’s 
Night and Day in another lan- 
guage. He recognized the feeling: 
it was the usual emotion of the 
hunter when the hunt is over, the 
born detective’s professional ver- 
sion of the post coitum triste. 
After looking at the smiling, sup- 
ple Dana Lje a moment more, 
however, he was almost content. 

“There’s one more thing,” he 
said. “I don’t want to be insuf- 
ferably skeptical about this — but 
I want to see it work. Thor, can 
we set up a sampling and smear- 
ing device such as Dana describes 
and run a test?” 

“In fifteen minutes,” Dr. Wald 



said. “We have most of the unit 
in already assembled form on our 
big ultrawave receiver, and it 
shouldn’t take any effort to add a 
high-speed tape unit to it. I’ll do 
it right now.” 

He went out. Weinbaum and 
Dana looked at each other for a 
moment, rather like strange cats. 
Then the security officer got up, 
with what he knew to be an air 
of somewhat grim determination, 
and seized his fiancee’s hands, an- 
ticipating a struggle. 

That first kiss was, by intention 
at least, mostly pro forma. But 
by the time Wald padded back 
into the office, the letter had been 
pretty thoroughly superseded by 
the spirit. 

^^HE scientist harrumphed and 
set his burden on the desk. 
“This is all there is to it,” he said, 
“but I had to hunt all through 
the library to find a Dirac record 
with a beep still on it. Just a mo- 
ment more while I make connec- 
tions . .” 

Weinbaum used the time to 
bring his mind back to the matter 
at hand, although not quite com- 
pletely. Then two tape spindles 
began to whir like so many bees, 
and the end-stopped sound of the 
Dirac beep filled the room. Wald 
stopped the apparatus,\ reset it, 
and started the smearing tape 
very slowly in the opposite di- 
rection. 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



A DISTANT babble of voices 
came from the speaker. As 
Weinbaum leaned forward tense- 
ly, one voice said clearly and 
loudly above the rest; 

“Hello, Earth bureau. Lt. T. L. 
Matthews at Hercules Station 
NGC 63<1, transmission date 
13-22-2091. We have the last 
point on the orbit-curve of your 
dope-runners plotted, and the 
curve itself points to a small sys- 
tem about 25 light-years from the 
base here; the ]>lace hasn’t even 
got a name on our charts. Scouts 
show the home planet at least 
twice as heavily fortified as we 
anticipated, so we’ll need another 
cruiser. We have a ‘can-do’ from 
you in the beep for us, but we’re 
waiting as ordered to get it in the 
present. NGC 6341 Matthews 
out.’’ 

After the first instant of stun- 
ned amazement — for no amount 
of intellectual willingness to ac- 
cept could have prepared him for 
the overwhelming fact itself — 
Weinbaum had grabbed a pencil 
and begun to write at top speed. 
As the voice signed out he threw 
the pencil down and looked ex- 
citedly at Dr. Wald. 

“Seven months ahead,” he said, 
aware that he was grinning like 
an idiot. “Thor, you know the 
trouble we’ve had with that nee- 
dle in the Hercules haystack! 
This orbit-curve trick must be 
something Matthews has yet to 



dream up — at least he hasn’t 
come to me with it yet, and 
there’s nothing in the situation 
as it stands now that would in- 
dicate a closing-time of six 
months for the case. The com- 
puters said it would take three 
more years.” 

“It’s new data,” Dr. Wald 
agreed solemnly. 

“Well, don’t stop there, in 
God’s name! Let’s hear some 
more!” 

Dr. Wald went through the 
ritual, much faster this time. The 
speaker said ; • 

“Nausentampen. Eddettompic. 
Berobsilom. Aimkaksetchoc. San- 
betogmow. Datdectamset. Dom- 
atrosmin. Out.” 

“My word,” Wald said. 
“What’s all that?” 

“That’s what I was talking 
about,” Dana Lje said. “At least 
half of what you get from the 
beep is just as incomprehensible. 
I suppose it’s whatever has hap- 
pened to the English language, 
thousands of years from now.” 

“No, it isn’t,” Weinbaum said. 
He had resumed writing, and was 
still at it, despite the compara- 
tive briefness, of the transmission. 
“Not this sample, anyhow. That, 
ladies and gentlemen, is code — no 
language consists exclusively of 
*four-syllable words, of that you 
can be sure. What’s more, it’s a 
version of our code. I can’t break 
it down very far — it takes a full- 



BEEP 



41 



time expert to read this stuff — 
but I get the date and some of the 
sense. It’s March 12, 3022, and 
there’s some kind of a mass evac- 
uation taking place. The message 
seems to be a routing order.” 

“But why will we be using 
code?” Dr. Wald wanted to know. 
“It implies that we think some- 
body might overhear us — some- 
body else with a Dirac. That 
could be very messy.” 

“It could indeed,” Weinbaum 
said. “But we’ll find out, I im- 
agine. Give her another spin, 
Thor.” ' 

“Shall I try for a picture this 
time?” 

Weinbaum nodded. A moment 
later, he was looking squarely 
into the green-skinned face of 
something that looked like an an- 
imated traffic signal with a hel- 
met on it. Though the creature 
had no mouth, the Dirac speaker 
was saying quite clearly, “Hello, 
Chief. This is Thammos NGC 
2287, transmission date Gor 60, 
302 by my calendar, July 2, 2973 
by yours. This is a lousy little 
planet. Everything stinks of oxy- 
gen, just like Earth. But the na- 
tives accept us and that’s the 
important thing. We’ve got your 
genius safely born. Detailed re- 
port coming later by paw. NGC 
2287 Thammos out.” 

“I wish I knew my New Gen- 
eral Catalogue better,” Wein- 
baum said. “Isn’t that M 41 in 



Canis Major, the one with the 
red star in the middle? And we’ll 
be using non-humanoids there! 
What was that creature, anyhow? 
Never mind, spin her again.” 

Dr. Wald spun her again. 
Weinbaum, already feeling a lit- 
tle dizzy, ha(J given up taking 
notes. That could come later, all 
that could come later. Now he 
wanted only scenes and voices, 
more and more scenes and voices 
from the future. They were bet- 
ter than aquavit, even with a beer 
chaser. 

Ill 

^T^HE indoctrination tape ended, 
and Krasna touched a button. 
The Dirac screen darkened, and 
folded silently back into the desk. 

“They didn’t see their way 
through to us, not by a long 
shot,” he said. “They didn’t see, 
for instance, that when one sec- 
tion of the government becomes 
nearly all-knowing — no matter 
how small it was to begin with — 
it necessarily becomes all of the 
government that there is. Thus 
the bureau turned into the Serv- 
ice and pushed everyone else out. 

“On the other hand, those peo- 
ple did come to be afraid that a 
government with an all-knowing 
arm might become a rigid dicta- 
torship. That couldn’t happen 
and didn’t happen, because the 
more you know, the wider your 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



field of possible operation be- 
comes and the more fluid and 
dynamic a society you need. How 
could a rigid society expand to 
other star-systems, let alone 
other galaxies? It couldn’t be 
done.” 

“I should think it could,” Jo 
said slowly. “After all, if you 
know in advance what every- 
body is going to do — ” 

“But we don’t, Jo. That’s just 
a popular fiction — or, if you like, 
a red herring. Not all of the busi- 
ness of the cosmos is carried on 
over the Dirac, after all. The 
only events we can ever overhear 
are those which are transmitted 
as a message. Do you order your 
lunch over the Dirac? Of course 
you don’t. Up to now, you’ve 
never said a word over the Dirac 
in your life. 

“And there’s much more to it 
than that. All dictatorships are 
based on the proposition that 
government can somehow control 
a man’s thoughts. We know now 
that the consciousness of the ob- 
server is the only free thing in 
the Universe. Wouldn’t we look 
foolish trying to control that, 
when our entire physics shows 
that it’s impossible to do s6? 
That’s why the Service is in no 
sense a thought police. We’re in- 
terested only in acts. We’re an 
Event Police.” 

“But why?” Jo said. “If all 
history is fixed, why do we bother 



with these boy-meets-girl assign- 
ments, for instance? The meet- 
ings will happen anyhow.” 

“Of course they will,” Krasna 
agreed immediately. “But look, 
Jo. Our interests as a government 
depend upon the future. We op- 
erate as if the future is as real as 
the past, and so far we haven’t 
been disappointed: the Service is 
100% successful. But that very 
success isn’t without its warnings. 
What would happen if we stop- 
ped supervising events? We don’t 
know, and we don’t dare take the 
chance. Despite the evidence that 
the future is fixed, we have to 
take on the role of the caretaker 
of inevitability. We believe that 
nothing can possibly go wrong 
. but we have to act on the 
philosophy that history helps 
only those who help themselves. 

“That’s why we safeguard 
huge numbers of courtships right 
through to contract, and even 
beyond it. We have to see to it 
that every single person who is 
mentioned in any Dirac ’cast 
gets born. Our obligation as 
Event Police is to make the events 
of the future possible, because 
those events are crucial to our 
society — even the smallest of 
them. It’s an enormous task, be- 
lieve me, and it gets bigger and 
bigger every day. Apparently it 
always will.” 

“Always?” Jo said. “What 
about the public? Isn’t it going

to smell this out sooner or later? 
The evidence is piling up at a 
terrific rate.” 

“Yes and no,” Krasna said. 
“Lots of people are smelling it 
out right now, just as you did. 
But the number of new people we 
need in the Service grows faster — 
it’s always ahead of the number 
of laymen who follow the clues 
to the truth.” 

J O took a deep breath. “You 
take all this as if it were as 
commonplace as boiling an egg, 
Kras,” he said. “Don’t you ever 
wonder about some of the things 
you get from the beep? That 
’cast Dana Lje picked up from 
Canes Venatici, for instance, the 
one from the ship that was travel- 
ling backward in time? How is 
that possible? What could be the 
purpose? Is it — ” 

“Pace, pace," Krasna said. “I 
don’t know, and I don’t care. 
Neither should you. That event 
is too far in the future for us to 
worry about. We can’t possibly 
know its context yet, so there’s 
no sense in trying to understand 
it. If an Englishman of around 
1600 had found out about the 
American Revolution, he would 
have thought it a tragedy; an 
Englishman of 1950 would have 
a very different view of it. We’re 
in the same spot. The messages 
we get from the really far future 
have no contexts yet.” 



“I think I see,” Jo said. “I’ll 
get used to it in time, I suppose, 
after I use the Dirac for a while. 
Or does my new rank authorize 
me to do that?” 

“Yes, it does. But, Jo, first I 
want to pass on to you a rule of 
Service etiquette that must never 
be broken. You won’t be allowed 
anywhere near a Dirac mike until 
you have it burned into your 
memory beyond any forgetful- 
ness.” 

“I’m listening, Kras, believe 
me.” 

“Good. This is the rule: The 
date of a- Serviceman’s death 
must never be mentioned in a 
Dirac ’cast." 

Jo blinked, feeling a little 
chilly. The reason behind the 
rule was decidedly tough-mind- 
ed, but its ultimate kindness was 
plain. He said, “I won’t forget 
that. I’ll want that protection 
myself. Many thanks, Kras. 
What’s my new assignment?” 

“To begin with,” Krasna said, 
grinning, “as simple a job as I’ve 
ever given you, right here on 
Randolph. Skin out of here and 
find me that cab-driver — ^the one 
who mentioned time-travel to 
you. He’s uncomfortably close to 
the truth; closer than you were 
in one category. 

“Find him, and bring him to 
me. The Service is about to take 
in a new raw recruit!”

The Boys From Vespis 

By ARTHUR SELLINGS 



It was all just a frightful 
mistake— but try convincing 
the Earthgirls that it was! 



^^"■"WON’T hear a word said 
I against them,” said Gil- 
B lespie, the owner of the 
bar. “They’re good clean-living 
lads.” 

“Unlike your regular custo- 
mers, is that it?” Herbert de- 
manded. 

“I didn’t say that. All I know 
is the Vespians are quiet — ” 

‘‘—dull—’’ 

“ — sensible lads. They come in 
and have a drink or two, and 
that’s that. No trouble, no fuss, 
no bellyaching.” He looked mean- 
ingly at Herbert. 

“What have they got to belly- 
ache about?” asked Herbert an- 
grily. “They come and land here. 
Nobody gets indignant, the way 
some of the natives have where 
our boys have landed. People 



treat them decently. Decently 
isn’t the word for the way the 
girls treat them! I tell you, it’s a 
revolting sight outside their ship. 
They’ve even put seats out on the 
green. Next thing, they’ll get a 
neat little Vespian sextet together 
and throw dances twice a week 
with food and drinks free.” 
“That’s what it boils down to, 
is it?” said Gillespie scornfully. 
“Primitive jealousy. That’s a very 
uncivilized attitude to take to- 
ward our guests.” 

“Guests are somebody you in- 
vite. Anyway, it’s a primitive 
matter. This isn’t a big town. 
Girls never were plentiful. Now 
they look down their noses at us 
local men. That sort of thing 
doesn’t interest you — or shouldn’t 
at your age. It’s all right for you

tradesmen, you pillars of the 
community. It’s the younger gen- 
eration who’ve got the com- 
plaints.” 

T¥ERBERT warmed to his 
theme. “How would you like 
it if a distillery floated from space 
and set up shop next door, selling 
real liquor, not this hooch, at 
cut prices.^ That’d be a different 
story then, wouldn’t it?” 

“Now who’s being insulting? If 
you don’t like the liquor, why do 
you drink it?” 

“Oh, yes, we ban always sell it 
to the Vespians, can’t we? And 
shortchange the good clean-living 
boys. I’ve seen you do it.” 

Gillespie grinned feebly. 
“That’s no way to talk, Herbert,” 
he said in half-hearted protest. 
“If the visitors are good for trade 
and make no trouble, why should 
we object? What benefits one 
benefits the community.” 

“You’re not making speeches 
in the Chamber of Commerce 
now. What benefits you and your 
friends benefits me less than 
nothing. I tell you, Gillespie, 
trouble’s brewing. The younger 
generation’s going to get these 
guests of ours railroaded out of 
town.” 

“Now, now, remember the In- 
terplanetary Welcome Statute. 
Any friendly visitors are welcome 
to Earth. Anyway, isn’t it a nice 
change to have human visitors. 



after some of the specimens we 
have had?” 

“Sure, sure. Most of the others 
never had a taste for liquor, or 
needed suits of clothes, or spent 
money on girls. But I’d much 
rather have any of the others, 
any day, than these black-haired 
Adonises with their damned per- 
fect manners. The green lizards 
from Arcturus were more fun. 
And one of those crystals from 
Sirius could sing a four-part har- 
mony all on his own. They had 
personality. All these Vespians 
are good for is to fill out their 
lousy opalescent shirts.” 

“They’re fine shirts. I’ve got a 
couple myself. Perhaps you’d like 
me to try and get you one.” 
“Thanks, I can beg one for 
myself.” 

“Now that’s not nice, Herbert. 
I didn’t beg them. My daughter 
Doris took one of the lads home 
to tea and he brought them along 
for me — as a nice friendly ges- 
ture. Kind of a souvenir.” 

“Ain’t that nice — traitor!” 
Gillespie smirked. “You don’t 
understand diplomacy. Friendli- 
ness encourages trade.” 

“You’d sell the planet from 
under our feet, if they made a 
good enough offer!” 

“You’ve got them all wrong, 
Herbert. They’re not here for 
trade. Little things like that are 
just ordinary acts of good will.” 
“Like taking the troublesome 



46 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



women off our hands for us. If 
they’re not here for trade, what 
are they here for?” 

“Now that's a stupid question. 
What do we go to other solar sys- 
tems for? To map the Universe. 
To establish contact with the far- 
flung civilizations of the Galaxy.” 
“Anybody would think you 
were an astronaut to hear you 
talk. Anyway, the approach of 
this bunch is a whole lot too 
smooth for my liking. It’s sus- 
picious.” 

“Only to people with suspicious 
minds.” 

Y OU wait, my friend,” said 
Herbert darkly. “You’ll wake 
up one morning to find they’ve 
taken over the planet, or some- 
thing like that. That’s it — ^they 
probably picked on Centerville 
to study small-town psychology. 
You’re probably down in their 
little red book. ‘Dominant type — 
trademan. Vulnerable to smooth 
talk, opalescent shirts and ap- 
proach through daughter.’ All 
this goes back to Vespis, wherever 
Vespis is. Hy the way, I suppose 
you realize nobody has ever 
heard of Vespis. The big boys on 
Vespis give the word, and one 
morning we’re being rounded up 
like cattle.” 

Gillespie laughed hollowly. 
“The extent to which some peo- 
ple’s distorted imaginations will 
take them — ” 

THE BOYS FROM VESPIS 



“I can think of worse things. 
I can think it’s suspicious that 
the Vespians come here with such 
a nice command of our language. 
That they fitted in so well from 
the start.” 

“Well, what’s so funny about 
that? Other creatures have come 
here with a working knowledge 
of the language.” 

“Because Earthmen had al- 
ready been to their system. We 
haven’t been to Vespis yet.” 
“Well, I suppose they picked 
it up on their travels. Anyway, 
I don’t see that it’s anything to 
get all steamed up about. Per- 
haps they understand it by in- 
tuition.” 

“Telepaths, eh? Then why 
don’t they say they’re telepaths? 
Tell me that.” 

“There’s no compulsion on 
anybody to say what he can do, 
is there?” Gillespie countered. 
“Besides, it wouldn’t be like the 
Vespians to go around bragging 
about what they can and can’t 
do. They’re too modest.” 

“They’re too modest,” Herbert 
mimicked scathingly. “They’re so 
phony! You wait. I know. I’ve 
^ot it.” He laughed mirthlessly. 
“They’re probably here on a 
white-slaving expedition. They 
make such a hit with the women, 
with their good looks and smooth 
manners. But all that’s just a 
blind. One of these days, they’ll 
sweep all the women into their 

47 



ship — under the guise of showing 
the sweet creatures how the dar- 
^ ling spaceboat works. And then, 
when they’re all safely on board, 
clang will go the ports, bang will 
go the rockets, and they’ll all be 
on their way to the vice dens of 
Vespis.” 

Gillespie laughed uproariously. 

“Decadence!” said Herbert bit- 
terly. “Always, when a civilization 
is on the verge of catastrophe, 
you’ll find it laughing at the 
prophets.” 

“Herbert,” Gillespie said be- 
tween spasms of laughter, “all 
this time I thought you were 
being serious. I’ve misjudged you 
in the past. If you can keep that 
up. I’ll hire you as a floor show. 
Right now, have a drink on the 
house. You’ve earned it.” 

“I don’t know that I should 
in such a traitorous bar. Only 
my present misery drives me to 
accept. Perhaps such a sacrifice 
of my principles will convince 
you of my desperation and high 
seriousness.” 

Gillespie only laughed again 
as he turned to get the promised 
drink. 

A T that moment, a Vespian, 
with the inevitable girl on 
his arm, walked into the bar. 
Herbert recognized the girl as 
one he’d dated a couple of times 
himself a year or so back. The 
change in her was remarkable. 



Then, he’d thought her rather al- 
most surly. Now, she was laughr 
ing at the Vespian and sparkling 
with pleasure. Herbert winced. 

Gillespie hastily slapped Her- 
bert’s drink down in front of him 
and concentrated on the Vespian, 
who ordered up with that deli- 
cate trace of unknown accent. As 
Gillespie hurried about his order 
in a way he would have done 
for no local inhabitant, the Ves- 
pian smiled amiably at Herbert 
and bowed graciously. 

Herbert forced his face into a 
stiff smile. The Vespian led his 
girl to a booth. Herbert swore 
under his breath. He had to hand 
it to them — they were certainly 
smooth. Perhaps you couldn’t 
really blame the girls. But there 
ought to be a law against it. 
Herbert was too consumed 
with jealousy to be surprised 
at finding himself on the 
side of the Puritans for once. 
But there ought to be some- 
thing. There ought to be — that 
was it — there ought to be some 
technicality they’d infringed. 

He racked his brains. Illegal 
entry? No, there was a special, 
dispensation for interplanetary 
visitors in that respect. A routine 
matter of inspection of the ship, 
impouriding of any weapons or 
dangerous mechanisms, checks 
for radioactivity and bacteria. 
The Vespians had been properly 
cleared. Customs or currency in- 



48 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




THE BOYS FROM VESPIS

fringements? Again, that didn’t 
apply to interplanetary visitors. 
There was even the I.W.F., the 
Interplanetary Welcome Fund, 
for those who needed it. The 
Vespians had come well-loaded 
with gold, anyway. That, come 
to think of it, was another ex- 
ample of their suspicious pre- 
paredness. 

“I tell you — ” he started to 
say to Gillespie, but Gillespie 
was leaning on the counter, smil- 
ing benignly in the direction of 
the Vespian and his girl friend. 
There was a faraway look on his 
face, as if he heard the sweet 
music of a symphony for cash 
registers. 

“Yes?" Gillespie asked dream- 
ily, without turning. 

“Oh, forget it,” said Herbert, 
draining his drink and sliding off 
his stool. “I’m going to do some- 
thing. I’m going to picket their 
ship. Or — or something.” 

evening scene, just outside 
the town, was like a delicate 
landscape by Watteau. Apart, 
that is, from the curving bright- 
ness of the ship and the costumes 
of the human and Vespian fig- 
ures. In the dying light of the 
spring day, couples were stretched 
out on the grass, or seated on 
the green rustic seats that the 
Vespians had thoughtfully pro- 
vided. Laughter and the sound of 
soft voices would have sounded 



idyllic to Herbert in another set- 
ting — with himself as participant. 

As he approached the green, 
faery lamps broke into a thou- 
sand soft points of multicolored 
light. Herbert grumbled at this 
latest bit of Vespian stage-man- 
aging. He grumbled again when 
he noticed the mobile cafeteria. 
But this was a purely terrestial 
enterprise. If things went on like 
this, there’d be a small town 
clustered around the ship before 
long. 

Apart from the cafeteria at- 
tendant, he seemed to be the only 
home-planet male around. The 
girls looked at him as if this 
were Vespis and he were the in- 
truder. The Vespians just smiled 
courteously. 

He flopped down on the grass 
before his legs sent him career- 
ing around the ship, yelling like 
a prophet of hellfire. He brooded. 
There had to be some way, some 
plan of action. Perhaps, if he 
stayed long enough, he’d spot 
the Vespians committing a breach 
of some minor bylaw or other, 
and he could get an injunction. 

But he looked about him for 
a long time, while the shadows 
grew longer and longer and final- 
ly merged, and he noticed nothing 
exceptionable. The Vespians con- 
ducted themselves with the ut- 
most decoriim. They seemed not 
to mind his presence in the least. 
But the eyes of the girls began 



so 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to flash whitely in the twilight, 
whitely — and dangerously — 
Herbert thought. An alarming 
image of himself being lynched 
by a horde of angry women flash- 
ed across his mind. 

On a sudden impulse, he rose 
and crossed to the main port of 
the Vespian ship. There was only 
one thing to do — talk this matter 
over with the Vespians, man to, 
so to speak, man. If he could 
show them that their conduct 
was resented, they might lay off. 

The Vespian sentry lolling ele- 
gantly at the foot of the ramp 
hardly looked like a guard, but 
that was his function, Herbert 
supposed. 

“I want to see the big man,” 
said Herbert gruffly. 

“Ah, yes,” said the Vespian, 
flashing a bright smile. “He may 
be in conference, but I’ll see. 
Who shall I say is calling?” 

It was too disarming. 

“Er — Mr. Herbert Plumtree.” 
He cursed inwardly to find him- 
self adding, in a polite tone he 
had not intended, “Er — on a so- 
cial matter.” 

“Certainly,” said the Vespian. 
“Excuse me.” He seemed to 
frown down at his shirt for a 
moment, then looked up. “Cer- 
tainly, Mr. Plumtree. This way, 
if you please.” And he led Her- 
bert up the ramp, down a softly 
lit corridor, into a small room and 
the presence of a Vespian even 



more handsome, if that were pos- 
sible, than the usual run of his 
breed. 

The Vespian rose courteously 
from his desk and stretched out 
his hand. “Good evening, Mr. 
Plumtree. Is there anything I can 
do for you?” 

“I — I — ” Herbert floundered. 
“Yes, there is. Correct as your 
men are in their behavior, I, as 
a deputation of one, would be 
very glad to see their handsome 
backs.” 

“See their backs? Oh, yes. But, 
Mr. Plumtree — ” the Vespian 
looked genuinely hurt — “I’m very 
sorry to hear that. Very sorry in- 
deed. How have we given offense? 
If any of my men . .” 

“There’s nothing personal in 
it,” said Herbert. 

TTE explained, briefly, the up- 
setting effect that the Ves- 
pians were having on the balance 
of the sexes in the small town. 

“Oh, dear!” said the Vespian 
chief when Herbert had finished. 
“Oh, dear me, I hadn’t thought 
of that.” 

He appeared to be in such a 
state of perturbation that Herb- 
ert’s worst suspicions were re- 
awakened. 

“Look here,” he said, feeling 
absurdly like a hero in an oldtime 
Western story. “Don’t act so 
damned innocent about it. You’re 
exactly the same as us. You 



THE BOYS FROM VESPIS 



51 



can’t pretend you weren’t aware 
of the effect you’d have. If you 
don’t clear out, I’m going to the 
authorities about it.” 

The Vespian became very agi- 
tated. His smooth Vespian man- 
ners momentarily deserted him. 

“But, Mr. Plumtree, surely you 
don’t — surely you wouldn’t . 
It was harmless, I assure you. We 
meant no harm.” 

“Well, you’ve caused plenty.” 
The Vespian said, “Do you 
mind if I consult my associates 
about this? Er — perhaps you’d 
like a drink?” 

■ “No, thank you,” said Herbert 
stiffly. It would probably be 
drugged anyway, he told himself. 

“Well, er — please excuse me a 
moment, if you will.” 

And the agitated Vespian slid 
out through a door at the end of ^ 
the room. 

Herbert felt a mixed sensation 
of triumph — and fear. This was 
the classical moment to make a 
dash for it. Or was it? He hadn’t 
found any real clue to the pur- 
pose of the Vespians yet. In his 
mind’s ear, he heard the roar of 
rockets as the alarmed Vespians 
took to their space-heels, bearing 
him off a captive. Or were they 
preparing a worse fate for him? 
After all, the only ones who had 
seen him enter the ship were the 
women outside, and he somehow 
felt that they would not be will- 
ing witnesses against their too- 



handsome swains. Well, if he had 
to be a martyr, perhaps the other 
fellows, when they woke up to 
what he had done for them, 
would erect a monument on the 
site. 

But no rockets sounded, no 
lethal gas hissed into the room. 
Instead, the door opened again 
and the chief Vespian came back, 
accompanied by two others. 

“Ah, Mr. Plumtree, I’m sorry. 
I hope my little flurry did not 
alarm you,” said the alien leader. 

Steady, steady, Herbert told 
himself, and waited without re- 
plying. 

“My associates here are of the 
same opinion as myself. We agree 
that we should tell you of our 
purpose in behaving as we have.” 

“Ah, so you do admit you had 
an ulterior purpose — ” 

“Certainly, Mr. Plumtree. 
Well, not exactly a purpose — ra- 
ther, a stratagem. It’s one we 
adopt on all the inhabited planets 
we visit. It had always been suc- 
cessful before. We did not realize 
that what evidently has happened 
here could happen. We made a 
slight error in our calculations 
and, believe me, we are both dis- 
tressed and pained.” 

^I'^HE Vespian smiled a smile 
of aching sincerity. 

They're playing for time, 
thought Herbert. Probably stok- 
ing up the rockets. 



52 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Come to the point,” he said. 

“We — well . The Vespian 
hesitated, then said, “I’ve com- 
muned with my associates and 
we are convinced that the best 
course is to tell you the situa- 
tion. We haven’t ever had to do 
so before, but such an awkward 
problem as this has never arisen 
before. We seek to cause as little 
distress as possible to the inhab- 
itants of the planets we visit, 
which was the reason for our 
stratagem in the first place. You 
see — ” he spread his hands in a 
gesture of heartfelt apology — 
“we’re not at all as you see us. In 
fact, we’re not really humanoid 
at all.” 

“Whatr 

“No, I assure you, Mr. Plum- 
tree, that we are not. I could 
prove it to you — let down the 
guard, as it were. But we have 
found, from distressing experi- 
ence, that of all possible aspects, 
ours is one which universally 
strikes the inhabitants of the rest 
of the Galaxy with, I am sorry 
to say, fear, panic and often out- 
right hostility. I hope you can 
appreciate that, Mr. Plumtree, 
and perhaps understand our feel- 
ings. Of course, to ourselves, in 
our natural state, we consider 
ourselves quite good-looking. And 
we are actually the kindest of 
creatures. 

“It wasn’t so much that our 
feelings were — well, a trifle hurt. 



More important, it was extremely 
difficult for us to carry on our 
peaceful researches on worlds 
where our presence was so strong- 
ly resented. So we learned to 
adapt ourselves to the ideal types 
of the people we meet.” 

"You can do that?” asked 
Herbert, astonished. 

“It was not easy at first, but 
we have grown quite proficient at 
it.” 

“I don’t believe you,” Herbert 
said flatly. 

“Mr. Plumtree,” said the Ves- 
pian, “I told you I could prove- 
it to you. I could give you a 
flicker. But you wouldn’t like it.” 

“Go on,” Herbert said stoutly. 
“I dare you.” 

“All right.” The Vespian look- 
ed worriedly resigned. “But 
please don’t hold it against me. 
You asked for it. Ready?” 

“Ready.” 

The Vespian flickered for a 
moment. 

“All right, all right,” gasped 
Herbert weakly. “I believe you.” 

“You see,” said the Vespian, 
“when we came to your planet, 
we evidently did our job too 
well. The men we made ourselves 
into are too perfect. And now 
that I’ve told you the facts, we’d 
better move on.” He sighed heav- 
ily. “It will be a pity, because 
we rather like your planet and 
we still have a lot of research to 
do.” He smiled wanly at Herbert. 



THE BOYS FROM VESPIS 



53 



“We do conduct research, of 
course. We don’t spend all our 
time with your girls.” 

He coughed. “I’m sorry to harp 
Uf>on a subject that is so painful 
to you. But you do understand, 
don’t you? It was only in the 
interest of good relations. We 
have done nothing — nothing at 
all — to encourage your girls.” 

H erbert was surprised to 
find himself feeling sorry for 
them. 

He brightened. “Why don’t 
you just modify the Adonis 
model? You could make your- 
selves just a little repulsive.” 
The Vespian laughed regret- 
fully. “Your girls know so many 
of us by now that they’ve given 
us pet names. They’d be sur- 
prised at the change. No, I’m 
afraid it’s too late for that now.” 
“Mm — I suppose so,” said 
Herbert. Then the thought struck 
him. “So many? Does that mean 
that all your crew are not ac- 
counted for?” 

“No, there are a few who’ve 
stayed aboard ship since we land- 
ed. Researchers, mechanics.” 
“Well, I’ve got a request to 
make,” Herbert said, “and I think 
it might be a solution for both of 
us.” He suddenly felt guilty and 
a traitor. But after all, he told 
himself, it wasn’t altruism that 
had brought him here — there was 
no altruism in matters like this. 



He outlined his idea to the Ves- 
pians. 

“Well,” he finished, “do you 
think you can do it?” A fresh 
twinge of guilt seized him. “And 
you could keep a few — er — in 
stock, as it were.” 

“And you would tell nobody 
else about this?” 

Herbert grinned. “Do you 
think for one moment I would?” 
The Vespian grinned, too. “No, 
I think not. Yes, it can be done. 
If you’ll just hold on a moment.” 
“Oh, just one thing,” said 
Herbert. 

“Yes?” 

“Don’t let down your standards 
of craftmanship.” 

“We won’t,” promised the Ves- 
pian. 

And when he returned with 
what Herbert had asked for, it 
was quite obvious that they 
hadn’t. 

When Herbert finally could 
speak, he said, “What — what 
shall I call you?” 

“Call me what you wish.” 
The voice, and the smile that 
accompanied it, besides sending a 
shiver of delight down Herbert’s

T hey had fled almost to 
the sheer ambient f^ce of 
the crater wall when the 
Falakian girl touched Farrell’s 
arm and pointed back through 
the scented, pearly mists. 

“Someone,” she said. Her voice 
stumbled over the almost for- 
gotten Terran word, but its sound 
was music. 

“No matter,” Farrell answered. 
“They’re too late now.” 

He pushed on, happily certain 
in his warm euphoric glow of 
mounting expectancy that what 
he had done to the ship made him 
— and his new-found paradise 
with him — secure. 

He had almost forgotten who 
they were; the pale half-mem- 
ories that drifted through his 
mind touched his consciousness 
lightly and without urgency, 
arousing neither alarm nor inter- 
est. 

The dusk grew steadily deeper, 
but the dimming of vision did 
not matter. 

Nothing mattered but the ful- 
fillment to come. 

Far above him, the lacy net- 
work of bridging, at one time so 
baffling, arched and vanished in 
airy grace into the colored mists. 
To right and left, other arms of 
the aerial maze reached out, 
throwing vague traceries from 
cliff to cliff across the valley floor. 
Behind him on the plain he could 
hear the eternally young people

playing about their little blue 
lake, flitting like gay shadows 
through the tamarisks and calling 
to each other in clear elfin voices 
while they frolicked after the 
fluttering swarms of great, bright- 
hued moths. 

The crater wall halted him and 
he stood with the Falakian girl 
beside him, looking back through 
the mists and savoring the sweet, 
quiet mystery of the valley. Mo- 
tion stirred there ; the pair of them 
laughed like anticipant children 
when two wide-winged moths 
swam into sight and floated to- 
ward them, eyes glowing like veil- 
ed emeralds. 

Footsteps followed, disembod- 
ied in the dusk. 

“It is only Xavier,” a voice said. 
Its mellow uninflection evoked a 
briefly disturbing memory of a 
slight gray figure, jointed yet 
curiously flexible, and a feature- 
less oval of face. 

It came out of the mists and 
halted a dozen yards away, and 
he saw that it spoke into a metal- 
lic box slung over one shoulder. 

“He is unharmed,” it said. “Di- 
rections?” 

Xavier? Directions? From 
whom? 

Another voice answered from 
the shoulder-box, bringing a sec- 
ond mental picture of a face — 
square and brown, black-browed 
and taciturnly humorless — that 
he had known and forgotten. 



Whose, and where? 

“Hold him there, Xav,” it said. 
“Stryker and I are going to try 
to reach the ship now.” 

The moths floated nearer, hum- 
ming gently. 

“You’re too late,” Farrell call- 
ed. “Go away. Let me wait in 
peace.” 

“If you knew what you’re wait- 
ing for,” a third voice said, “you’d 
go screaming mad.” It was famil- 
iar, recalling vaguely a fat, good- 
natured face and ponderous, 
laughter-shaken paunch. “If you 
could see the place as you saw it 
when we first landed . .” 

The disturbing implications of 
the words forced him reluctantly 
to remember a little of that first 
sight of Falak. 

. The memory was sacrilege, 
soiling and cheapening the ec- 
stasy of his anticipation. 

But it had been different. 

TTIS first day on Falak had left 
Farrell sick with disgust. 

He had known from the be- 
ginning that the planet was 
small and arid, non-rotating, with 
a period of revolution about its 
primary roughly equal to ten 
Earth years. The Marco Four's 
initial sweep of reconnaissance, 
spiraling from pole to pole, had 
supplied further information 
without preparing him at all for 
what the three-man Reclamations 
team was to find later.

The weed-choked fields and 
crumbled desolation of Terran 
slave barracks had been depress- 
ing enough. The inevitable scat- 
tering of empty domes abandoned 
a hundred years before by the 
Hymenop conquerors had com- 
pleted a familiar and unpromising 
pattern, a workaday blueprint 
that differed from previous ex- 
perience only in one significant 
detail; There was no shaggy, 
disoriented remnant of descend- 
ants from the original colonists. 

The valley, a mile-wide crater 
«sunk between thousand-foot cliffs, 
floored with straggling bramble 
thickets and grass flats pocked 
with stagnant pools and quaking 
slime-bogs, had„:been infinitely 
worse. The cryptic three-dimen- 
sional maze of bridges spanning 
the pit had made landing there a 
ticklish undertaking. Stryker and 
Farrell and Gibson, after a con- 
ference, had risked the descent 
only because the valley offered a 
last possible refuge for survivors. 

Their first real hint of what 
lay ahead of them came when 
Xavier, the ship’s mechanical, 
opened the personnel port against 
the heat and humid stink of the 
place. 

“Another damned tropical pest- 
hole,” Farrell said, shucking off 
his comfortable shorts and don- 
ning booted coveralls for the pre- 
liminary survey. “The sooner we 
count heads — assuming there are 



any left to count — and get out of 
here, the better. The long-term 
Reorientation boys can have this 
one and welcome.” 

Stryker, characteristically, had 
laughed at his navigator’s prompt 
disgust. Gibson, equally predict- 
able in his way, had gathered his 
gear with precise efficiency, saying 
nothing. 

“It’s a routine soon finished,” 
Stryker said. “There can’t be 
more than a handful of survivors 
here, and in any case we’re not 
required to do more than gather 
data from full-scale recoloniza- 
tion. Our main job is to prepare 
Reorientation if we can for what- 
ever sort of slave-conditioning 
deviltry the Hymenops practiced 
on this particular world.” 

Farrell grunted sourly. “You 
love these repulsive little puzzles, 
don’t you?” 

OTRYKER grinned at him with 
^ good-natured malice. “Why 
not, Arthur? You can play the 
accordion and sketch for enter- 
tainment, and Gib has his star- 
maps and his chess sessions with 
Xavier. But for a fat old man, 
rejuvenated four times and near- 
ing his fifth and final, what else 
is left except curiosity?” 

He clipped a heat-gun and au- 
dicom pack to the belt of his 
bulging coveralls and clumped to 
the port to look outside. Roiling 
gray fog hovered there, diffusing

the hot magenta point of Falak’s 
sun to a liverish glare half- 
eclipsed by the crater’s southern 
rim. Against the light, the spidery 
metal maze of foot-bridging stood 
out dimly, tracing a random criss- 
cross pattern that dwindled to in- 
visibility in the mists. 

“That network is a Hymenop 
experiment of some sort,’’- Stryker 
said, peering. “It’s not only a 
sample of alien engineering — and 
a thundering big one at that — 
but an object lesson on the weird 
workings of alien logic. If we 
could figure out what possessed 
the Bees to build such a maze 
here — ’’ 

“Then we’d be the first to 
solve the problem of alien psy- 
chology,” Farrell finished acidly, 
aping the older man’s ponderous 
enthusiasm. “Lee, you, know we’d 
have to follow those hive-build- 
ing fiends all the way to 70 
Ophiuchi to find out what makes 
them tick. And twenty thousand 
light-years is a hell of a way 
to go out of curiosity, not to men- 
tion a dangerous one.” 

“But we’ll go there some day,” 
Stryker said positively. “We’ll 
have to go because we can’t ever 
be sure they won’t try to repeat 
their invasion of two hundred 
years ago.” 

He tugged at the owlish tufts 
of hair over his ears, wrinkling 
his bald brow up at the enigmatic 
maze. 



“We’ll never feel safe again un- 
til the Bees are wiped out. I won- 
der if they know that. They never 
understood us, you know, just as 
we never understood them — ^they 
always seemed more interested in 
experimenting with slave ecology 
than in conquest for itself, and 
they never killed off their captive 
cultures when they pulled out for 
home. I wonder if their system 
of logic can postulate the idea of 
a society like ours, which must 
rule or die.” 

“We’d better get on with our 
survey,” Gibson put in mildly, 
“unless we mean to finish by 
floodlight. We’ve only about 
forty-eight hours left before 
dark.” 

TTE moved past Stryker through 
the port, leaving Farrell to 
stare blankly after him. 

“This is a non-rotating world,” 
Farrell said. “How the devil can 
it get dark, Lee?” 

Stryker chuckled. “I wondered 
if you’d see that. It can’t, except 
when the planet’s axial tilt rolls 
this latitude into its winter season 
and sends the sun south of the 
crater rim. It probably gets dark 
as pitch here in the valley, since 
the fog would trap even diffused 
light.” To the patiently waiting 
mechanical, he said, “The ship is 
yours, Xav. Call us if an 3 d:hing 
turns up.” 

Farrell followed him reluctant-

ly outside into a miasmic desola- 
tion more depressing than he 
could have imagined. 

A stunted jungle of thorny 
brambles and tough, waist-high 
grasses hampered their passage at 
first, ripping at coveralls and 
tangling the feet until they had 
beaten their way through it to 
lower ground. There they found 
a dreary expanse of bogland 
where scummy pools of stagnant 
water and festering slime heaved 
sluggishly with oily bubbles of 
marsh* gas that burst audibly in 
the hanging silence. The liverish 
blaze of Falakian sun bore down 
mercilessly from the crater’s rim. 

They moved on to skirt a small 
lead-colored lake in the center of 
the valley, a stagnant seepage- 
basin half obscured by floating 
scum. Its steaming mud-flats were 
littered with rotting yellowed 
bones and supported the first life 
they had seen, an unpleasant 
scurrying of small multipedal 
crustaceans and water-lizards. 

“There can’t be any survivors 
here," Farrell said, appalled by 
the thought of his kind perpetuat- 
ing itself in a place like this. 
“God, think what the mortality 
rate would be! They’d die like 
flies." 

“There are bound to be a few,” 
Stryker stated, “even after a hun- 
dred years of slavery and another 
hundred of abandonment. The 
human animal, Arthur, is the 



most fantastically adaptable — ’’ 

He broke off short when they 
rounded a clump of reeds and 
stumbled upon their first Falak- 
ian proof of that fantastic adapt- 
ability. 

young woman squatting 
on the mudflat at their feet 
stared back at them with vacuous 
light eyes half hidden behind a 
wild tangle of matted blonde hair. 
She was gaunt and filthy, plast- 
ered with slime from head to foot, 
and in her hands she held the 
half-eaten body of a larger crus- 
tacean that obviously had died of 
natural causes and not too re- 
cently, at that. 

Farrell turned away, swallow- 
ing his disgust. Gibson, unmoved, 
said with an aptness bordering — 
for him — on irony: “Too damned 
adaptable, Lee. Sometimes our 
kind survives when it really 
shouldn’t.’’ 

A male child of perhaps four 
came out of the reeds and stared 
at them. He was as gaunt and 
filthy as the woman, but less 
vapid of face. Farrell, watching 
the slow spark of curiosity bloom 
in his eye?, wondered sickly how 
many years — or how few — must 
pass before the boy was reduced 
to the same stupid bovinity as 
the mother. 

Gibson was right, he thought. 
The compulsion to survive at any 
cost could be a curse instead of 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



60 



an asset. The degeneracy of these 
poor devils was a perpetual af- 
front to the race that had put 
them there. 

He was about to say as much 
when the woman rose and plod- 
ded away through the mud, the 
child at her heels. It startled 
him momentarily, when he fol- 
lowed their course with his eyes, 
to see that perhaps a hundred 
others had gathered to wait in- 
curiously for them in the near 
distance. All were as filthy as 
. the first two, but with a grotesque 
uniformity of appearance that left 
him frowning in uneasy specu- 
lation until he found words to 
identify that similarity. 

“They’re all young,” he said. 
“The oldest can’t be more than 
twenty — twenty-five at most!’’ 
Stryker scowled, puzzled with- 
out sharing Farrell’s unease. 
“You’re right. Where are the 
older ones?” 

• “Another of your precious little 
puzzles,” Farrell said sourly. “I 
hope you enjoy unraveling it.” 
“Oh, we’ll get to the bottom 
of it,” Stryker said with assur- 
ance. “We’ll have to, before we 
can leave them here.” 

They made a slow circuit of the 
lake, and the closer inspection 
offered a possible solution to the 
problem Stryker had posed. 
Chipped and weathered as the 
bones littering the mudflats were, 
their grisly shapings were un- 



mistakable. 

“I’d say that these are the 
bones of the older people,” Stryk- 
er hazarded, “and that they, rep- 
resent the end result of another 
of these religio-economic control 
compulsions the Hymenops like 
to condition into their slaves. 
Men will go to any lengths to 
observe a tradition, especially 
when its origin is forgotten. If 
these people were once condition- 
ed to look on old age as intoler- 
able—” 

“If you’re trying to say that 
they kill each other off at ma- 
turity,” Farrell interrupted, “the 
inference is ridiculous. In a hun- 
dred years they’d have outgrown 
a custom so hard to enforce. The 
balance of power would have 
rested with the adults, not with 
the children, and adults are gen- 
erally fond of living. 

S TRYKER looked to Gibson 
for support, received none, 
and found himself saddled with 
his own contention. “Economic 
necessity, then, since the valley 
can support only a limited num- 
ber. Some of the old North Ameri- 
can Indians followed a similar 
custom, the oldest son throttling 
the father when he grew too old 
to hunt.” 

“But even there infanticide was 
more popular than patricide,” 
Farrell pointed out. “No group 
would practice decimation from

61 



the top down. It’s too difficult 
to enforce.” 

Stryker answered him with a 
quotation from the Colonial Rec- 
lamations Handbook, maliciously 
taking the pontifical classmaster’s 
tone best calculated to irritate 
Farrell. 

“ Chapter Four, Subsection 
One, Paragraph Nineteen: Any 
custom, fixation or . compulsion 
accepted as the norm by one 
^roup of human beings can be 
understood and evaluated by any 
other group not influenced by the 
same ideology, since the basic 
perceptive abilities of both are 
necessarily the same through 
identical heredity. Evaluation of 
alien motivations, conversely — ” 

“Oh, hell,” Farrell cut in weari- 
ly. “Let’s get back to the ship, 
shall we? We’ll all feel more 
like—” 

His right foot gave way be- 
neath him without warning, 
crushing through the soft ground 
and throwing him heavily. He 
sat up at once, and swore- in in- 
credulous anger when he found 
the ankle swelling rapidly inside 
his boot. 

“Sprained! Damn it all!” 

Gibson and Stryker, on their 
knees beside the broken crust of 
soil, ignored him. Gibson took up 
a broken length of stick and 
prodded intently in the cavity, 
prying out after a moment a 
glistening two-foot ellipsoid that 



struggled feebly on the ground. 

“A chrysalid,” Stryker said, 
bending to gauge the damage 
Farrell’s heavy boot had done. 
“In a very close pre-eclosion 
stage. Look, the protective 
sheathing has begun to split al- 
ready.” 

The thing lay twitching aim- 
lessly, prisoned legs pushing 
against its shining transparent 
integument in an instinctive at- 
tempt at premature freedom. The 
movement was purely reflexive; 
its head, huge-eyed and as large 
as a man’s clenched fist, had been 
thoroughly crushed under Far- 
rell’s heel. 

Oddly, its injury touched Far- 
rell even through the pain of his 
injured foot. 

“It’s the first passably hand- 
some thing we’ve seen in this 
pesthole,” he said, “and I’ve 
maimed it. Finish it off, will 
you?” 

Stryker grunted, feeling the 
texture of the imprisoning sheath 
with curious fingers. “What would 
it have been in imago, Gib? A 
giant butterfly?” 

“A moth,” Gibson said tersely. 
“Lepidoptera, anyway.” 

He stood up and ended the 
chrysalid’s strugglings with a bolt 
from his heat-gun before extend- 
ing a hand to help Farrell up. 
“I’d like to examine it closer, 
but there’ll be others. Let’s get 
Arthur out of here.”

riiHEY went back to the ship by 
slow stages, pausing now and 
then while Gibson gathered a 
small packet of bone fragments 
from the mudflats and under- 
brush. 

“Some of these are older than 
others,” he explained when Stryk- 
er remarked on his selection. 
“But none are recent. It should 
help to know their exact age.” 

An hour later, they were bathed 
and dressed, sealed off comfort- 
ably in the ship against the hu- 
mid heat and stink of the swamp. 
Farrell lay on a chart room ac- 
celeration couch, resting, while 
Stryker taped his swoHen ankle. 
Gibson and Xavier, the one dis- 
daining rest and the other need- 
ing none, used the time to run a 
test analysis on the bones brought 
in from the lakeside. 

The results of that analysis 
were more astonishing than il- 
luminating. 

A majority of the fragments 
had been exposed to climatic 
action for some ten years. A 
smaller lot averaged twenty 
years; and a few odd chips, pre- 
served by long burial under al- 
luvial silt, thirty. 

“The older natives died at ten- 
year intervals, then,” St|ryker 
said. “And in considerable num- 
bers; the tribe must have been cut 
to half strength each time. But 
why?” He frowned unhappily, 
fishing for opinion. “Gib, can it 



really be a perversion of religious 
custom dreamed up by the Hy- 
menops to keep their slaves un- 
der control? A sort of festival of 
sacrifice every decade, climaxing 
in tribal decimation?” 

“Maybe they combine godli- 
ness with gluttony,” Farrell put 
in, unasked. “Maybe their orgy 
runs more to long pig than to 
piety.” 

He stood up, wincing at the 
pain, and was hobbling toward 
his sleeping cubicle when Gibson’s 
answer to Stryker’s question 
stopped him with a cold prickle 
along his spine. 

“We’ll know within twenty- 
four hours,” Gibson said. “Since 
both the decimations and the 
winter darkness periods seem to 
follow the same cycle. I’d say 
there’s a definite relationship.” 

■|70R once Farrell’s cubicle, 
soundproofed and comfort- 
able, brought him only a fitful 
imitation of sleep, an intermittent 
dozing that wavered endlessly 
between nightmare and wakeful- 
ness. When he crawled out again, 
hours later, he found Xavier wait- 
ing for him alone with a thermo- 
bulb of hot coffee. Stryker and 
Gibson, the mechanical said 
blandly, had seen no need of 
waking him, and had gone out 
alone on a more extensive tour 
of investigation. 

The hours dragged intermin-

ably. Farrell uncased his beloved 
accordion, but could not bear the 
sound of it; he tried his sketch- 
book, and could summon to mind 
no better subjects than drab 
miasmic bogs and steaming mud- 
flats. He discarded the idea of 
chess with Xavier without even 
weighing it — he would not have 
lasted past the fourth move, and 
both he and the mechanical knew 
it. 

He was reduced finally to limp- 
ing about the ship on his ban- 
daged foot, searching for some 
routine task left undone and find- 
ing nothing. He even went so far 
as to make a below-decks check 
on the ship’s matter-synthesizer, 
an indispensable unit designed for 
the conversion of waste to any 
chemical compound, and gave it 
up in annoyance when he found 
that all such operational details 
were filed with infallible exact- 
ness in Xavier’s plastoid h6ad. 

The return of Stryker and Gib- 
son only aggravated his impa- 
tience. He had expected them to 
discover concealed approaches to 
the maze of bridging overhead, 
tunnelings in the cliff-face to 
hidden caverns complete with 
bloodstained altars and caches 
of sacrificial weapons, or at least 
some ominous sign of preparation 
among the natives. But theffe was 
nothing. 

“No more than yesterday,” 
Stryker said. Failure had cost him 



a share of his congenital good- 
humor, leaving him restless and 
uneasy. “There’s nothing to find, 
Arthur. We’ve seen it all.” 

Surprisingly, Gibson disagreed. 

“We’ll know what we’re after 
when darkness falls,” he said. 
“But that’s a good twelve hours 
away. In the meantime, there’s 
a possibility that our missing key 
is outside the crater, rather than 
here inside it.” 

f^HEY turned on him together, 
both baffled and apprehensive. 

“What do you mean, outside?” 
Farrell demanded. “There’s noth- 
ing there t)ut grassland. We made 
sure of that at planetfall.” 

“We mapped four Hymenop 
domes on reconnaissance,” Gib- 
son reminded him. “But we only 
examined three to satisfy our- 
selves that they were empty. The 
fourth one — ” 

Farrell interrupted derisively. 
“That ancient bogey again? Gib, 
the domes are always empty. The 
Bees pulled out a hundred years 
ago.” 

Gibson said nothing, but his 
black-browed regard made Far- 
rell flush uncomfortably. 

“Gib is right,” Stryker inter- 
vened. “You’re too young in 
Colonial Reclamations to appre- 
ciate the difficulty of recognizing 
an alien logic, Arthur, let alone 
the impossibility of outguessing 
it. I’ve knocked about these 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ecological madhouses for the bet- 
ter part of a century, and the 
more I see of Hymenop work, the 
more convinced I am that we’ll 
never equate human and Hy- 
menop ideologies. It’s like trying 
to add quantities of dissimilar 
objects and expressing the result 
in a single symbol; it can’t be 
done, because there’s no possible 
common denominator for reduc- 
ing the disparate elements to 
similarity.” 

"WTHEN Farrell kept silent, he 
” went on, “Our own reactions, 
and consequently our motiva- 
tions, are based on broad at- 
tributes of love, hate, fear, greed 
and curiosity. We might em- 
pathize with another species that 
reacts as we do to those same 
stimuli — but what if that other 
species recognizes only one or 
two of them, or none at all? What 
if their motivations stem from a 
set of responses entirely different 
from any we know?” 

“There aren’t any,” Farrell said 
promptly. “What do you think 
would they be?” 

“There you have it,” Stryker 
said triumphantly. He chuckled, 
his good-nature restored. “We 
can’t imagine what those emo- 
tions would be like because we 
aren’t equipped to understand. 
Could a race depending entirely 
on extra-sensory perception ap- 
preciate a Mozart quintet or a 



Botticelli altar piece or a per- 
formance of Hamlet? You know 
it couldn’t — ^the esthetic nuances 
that make those works great 
would escape it completely, be- 
cause the motives that inspired 
their creation are based on a set 
of values entirely foreign to its 
comprehension. 

“There’s a digger wasp on 
Earth whose female singles out 
a particular species of tarantula 
to feed her larvae — and the spider 
stands patiently by, held by some 
compulsion whose nature we can’t 
even guess, while the wasp digs a 
grave, paralyzes the spider and 
shoves it into the hole with an 
egg attached. The spider could 
kill the wasp, and will kill one of 
any other species, but it submits 
to that particular kind without 
a flicker of protest. And if we 
can’t understand the mechanics of 
such a relationship between re- 
flexive species, then what chance 
have we of understanding the 
logic of an intelligent race of 
aliens? The results of its activi- 
ties can be assessed, but not the 
motivations behind those activi- 
ties.” 

“All right,” Farrell conceded. 
“You and Gib are right, as usual, 
and I’m wrong. We’ll check that 
fourth dome.” 

“You’ll stay here with Xav,” 
Stryker said firmly, “while Gib 
and I check. You’d only punish 
yourself, using that foot.”

65 



A FTER another eight-hour 
period of waiting, Farrell was 
nearing the end of his patience. 
He tried to rationalize his un- 
easiness and came finally to the 
conclusion that his failing hinged 
on a matter of conditioning. He 
was too accustomed to the stable 
unity of their team to feel com- 
fortable without Gibson and 
Stryker. Isolated from their per- 
petual bickering and the pleasant 
unspoken warmth of their regard, 
he was lonesome and tense. 

It would have been different, 
he knew, if either of the others 
had been left behind. Stryker had 
his beloved Reclamations texts 
and his microfilm albums of prob- 
lems solved on other worlds; Gib- 
son had his complicated galactic 
charts and his interminable chess 
bouts- with Xavier . 

Farrell gave it up and limped 
outside, to stand scowling un- 
happily at the dreary expanse of 
swampland. Far down under the 
reasoning levels of his conscious- 
ness a primal uneasiness nagged 
at him, whispering in wordless 
warning that there was more to 
his mounting restlessness than 
simple impatience. Something in- 
side him was changing, burgeon- 
ing in strange and disturbing 
growth. 

A pale suggestion of movement, 
wavering and uncertain in the 
eddying fog, caught his eye. A 
moment of puzzled watching told 



him that it was the bedraggled 
young woman they had seen 
earlier by the lake, and that she 
was approaching the ship timor- 
ously and under cover. 

“But why?” he wondered aloud, 
recalling her bovine lack of curi- 
osity. “What the devil can she 
want here?” 

A shadow fell across the valley. 
Farrell, startled, looked up sharp- 
ly to see the last of the Falakian 
sun’s magenta glare vanishing be- 
low the crater’s southern rim. A 
dusky forerunner of darkness set- 
tled like a tangible cloud, soften- 
ing the drab outlines of bramble 
thickets and slime pools. The 
change that followed was not seen 
but felt, a swelling rush of glad 
arousal like the joy of a child 
opening its eyes from sleep. 

To Farrell, the valley seemed 
to stir, waking in sympathy to 
his own restlessness and banish- 
ing his unease. 

r^HE girl ran to him through 
* the dusk on quick, light feet, 
timidity forgotten, and he saw 
with a pleasant shock of astonish- 
ment that she was no longer the 
filthy creature he had first seen 
by the lakeside. She was pretty 
and nubile, eyes and soft mouth 
smiling together in a childlike 
eagerness that made her at once 
infinitely desirable and untouch- 
ably innocent. 

“Who are you?” he asked shak-

ily. 

Her hesitant voice was music, 
rousing in Farrell a warm and 
expectant euphoria that glowed 
like old wine in his veins. 

“Koaele,” she said. “Look — ” 

Behind her, the valley lay 
wrapped like a minor paradise in 
soft pearly mists and luminous 
shadows, murmurous with the far 
sound of running water and the 
faint chiming of voices that drift- 
ed up from the little blue lake to 
whisper back in cadenced echo 
from the fairy maze of bridging 
overhead. Over it all, like a deepv 
sustained cello note, rose the 
muted humming of great flame- 
winged moths dipping and sway- 
ing over bright tropical flowers. 

‘“Moths?” he thought. And 
then, “Of course.” 

The chrysalids under the' sod, 
their eclosion time completed, 
were coming into their own — 
bringing perfection with them. 
Born in gorgeous iridescent 
imago, they were beautiful in a 
way that hurt with the yearning 
pain of perfection, the sorrow 
that imperfection existed at all — 
the joy of finally experiencing 
flawlessness. 

An imperative buzzing from the 
ship behind him made a rude in- 
trusion. A familiar voice, polite 
but without inflection, called from 
an open port: “Captain Stryker 
in the scoutboat, requesting an- 
swer.” 



Farrell hesitated. To the girl, 
who followed him with puzzled, 
eager eyes, he begged, “Don’t run 
away, please. I’ll be back.” 

In the ship, Stryker’s moon- 
face peered wryly at him from the 
main control screen. 

“Drew another blank,” it said. 
“You were right after all, Arthur 
— the fourth dome was empty. 
Gib and I are coming in now. We 
can’t risk staying out longer if 
we’re going to be on hand when 
the curtain rises on our little 
mystery.” 

“Mystery?” Farrell echoed 
blankly. Earlier discussions came 
back slowly, posing a forgotten 
problem so ridiculous that he 
laughed. “We were wrong about 
all that. It’s wonderful here.” 

OTRYKER’S face on the screen 
^ went long with astonishment. 
“Arthur, have you lost your 
mind? Whaf’s wron^ there?” 
“Nothing is wrong,” Farrell 
said. “It’s right.” Memory prod- 
ded him again, disturbingly. 
“Wait — I remember now what it 
was we came here for. But we’re 
not going through with it.” 

He thought of the festival to 
come, of the young men and girls 
running lithe in the dusk, splash- 
ing in the lake and calling joyous- 
ly to each other across the pale 
sands. The joyous innocence of 
their play brought an appalling 
realization of what would happen

if the fat outsider on the screen 
should have his way: 

The quiet paradise would be 
shattered and refashioned in 
smoky facsimile of Earth, the 
happy people herded together 
and set to work in dusty fields 
and whirring factories, multiply- 
ing tensions and frustrations as 
they multiplied their numbers. 

For what? For whom? 

“You’ve got no right to go back 
and report all this,” Farrell said 
plaintively. “You’d ruin every- 
thing.” 

The alternative came to him 
and with it resolution. “But you 
won’t go back. I’ll see to that.” 

He left the screen and turned 
on the control panel with fingers 
that remembered from long habit 
the settings required. Stryker’s 
voice bellowed frantically after 
him, unheeded, while he fed into 
the ship’s autopilot a command 
that would send her plunging 
skyward bare minutes later. 

Then, ignoring the waiting 
mechanical’s passive stare, he 
went outside. 

The valley beckoned. The elfin 
laughter of the people by the lake 
touched a fey, responsive chord in 
him that blurred his eyes with 
ecstatic tears and sent him run- 
ning down the slope, the Falakian 
girl keeping pace beside him. 

Before he reached the lake, he 
had dismissed from his mind the 
ship and the men who had 



brought it there. 

T>UT they would not let him 
^ forget. The little gray jointed 
one followed him through the 
dancing and the laughter and 
cornered him finally against the 
sheer cliff side. .With the chase 
over, it held him there, waiting 
with metal patience in the grow- 
ing dusk. 

The audicom box slung over its 
shoulder boomed out in Gibson’s 
voice, the sound a noisy desecra- 
tion of the scented quiet. 

“Don’t let him get away, Xav,” 
it said. “We’ce going to try for 
the ship now.” 

The light dimmed, the soft 
shadows deepened. The two 
great-winged moths floated near- 
er, humming gently, their eyes 
glowing luminous and intent in 
the near-darkness. Mist currents 
from their approach brushed 
Farrell’s face, and he held out 
his arms in an ecstasy of antici- 
pation that was a consummation 
of all human longing. 

“Now," he whispered. 

The moths dipped nearer. 

The mechanical sent out a sear- 
ing beam of orange light that 
tore the gloom, blinding him 
briefly. The humming ceased; 
when he could see again, the 
moths lay scorched and black- 
ened at his feet. Their dead eyes 
looked up at him dully, charred 
and empty; their bright gauzy 



68

wings smoked in ruins of ugly, 
whiplike ribs. 

He flinched when the girl touch- 
ed his shoulder, pointing. A moth 
dipped toward them out of the 
mists, eyes glowing like round 
emerald lanterns. Another fol- 
low'ed. 

The mechanical flicked out its 
orange beam and cut them down. 

A roar like sustained thunder 
rose across the valley, shaking 
the ground underfoot. A column 
of white-hot fire tore the night. 

“The ship,” Farrell said aloud, 
remembering. 

He had a briefly troubled 
vision of the sleek metal shell 
lancing up toward a black void 
of space powdered with cold star- 
points whose names he had for- 
gotten, marooning them all in 
Paradise. 

The audicom boomed in Gib- 
son’s voice, though oddly shaken 
and strained. “Made it. Is he 
still safe, Xav?” 

“Safe,” the mechanical an- 
swered tersely. “The natives, too, 
so far.” 

“No thanks to him,” Gibson 
said. “If you hadn’t canceled the 
blastoff order he fed into the 
autopilot . .” But after a moment 
of ragged silence: “No, that’s 
^ hardly fair. Those damned moths 
, beat down Lee’s resistance in the 
few minutes it took us to reach 
the ship, and nearly got me as 
well. Arthur was exposed to their 



influence from the moment they 
started coming ouL” 

Stryker’s voice cut in, sound- 
ing more shaken than Gibson’s. 
“Stand fast down there. I’m set- 
ting off the first flare now.” 

A SILENT explosion of light, 
searing and unendurable, 
blasted the night. Farrell cried 
out and shielded his eyes with his 
hands, his ecstasy of anticipation 
draining out of him like heady 
wine from a broken urn. Full 
memory returned numbingly. 

When he opened his eyes again, 
the Falakian girl had run away. 
Under the merciless glare of light, 
the valley was as he had first seen 
it — a nauseous charnel place of 
bogs and brambles and mudflats 
littered with yellowed bones. 

In the near distance, a haggard 
mob of natives cowered like gap- 
ing, witless caricatures of hu- 
manity, faces turned from the 
descending blaze of the parachute 
flare. There was no more music 
or laughter. The great moths flut- 
tered in silent frenzy, stunned by 
the flood o£» light. 

“So that’s it,” Farrell thought 
dully. "They come out with the 
winter darkness to breed and lay 
their eggs, and they hold over 
men the same sort of compulsion 
that Terr an wasps hold over their 
host tarantulas. But they’re noc- 
turnal. They lose their control in 
the light.” 



PET FARM

Incredulously, he recalled the 
expectant euphoria that had 
blinded him, and he wondered 
sickly: “Is that what the spider 
feels while it watches its grave 
being dug?” 

A second flare bloomed far up 
in the fog, outlining the criss- 
cross network of bridging in stark, 
alien clarity. A smooth minnow- 
shape dipped past and below it, 
weaving skilfully through the 
maze. The mechanical’s voice box 
spoke again. 

“Give us a guide beam, Xav. 
We’re bringing the Marco down.’’ 

The ship settled a dozen yards 
away, its port open. Farrell, 
with Xavier at his heels, went 
inside hastily, not looking back. 

Gibson crouched motionless 
over his control panel, too intent 
on his readings to look up. Be- 
side him, Stryker said urgently: 
“Hang on. We’ve got to get up 
and set another flare, quickly.’’ 

The ship surged upward. 

1"rOURS later, they watched the 
last of the flares glare below 
in a steaming geyser*of mud and 
scum. The ship hovered motion- 
less, its only sound a busy dron- 
ing from the engine room where 
her mass-synthesizer discharged 
a deadly cloud of insecticide into 
the crater. 

“There’ll be some nasty cough- 
ing among the natives for a few 
days after this,’’ Gibson said. 



“But it’s better than being food 
for larvae . Reorientation will 
pull them out of that pesthole in 
a couple of months, and another 
decade will see them raising cat- 
tle and wheat again outside. The 
young adapt fast.” 

“The young, yes,” Stryker 
agreed uncomfortably. “Person- 
ally, I’m getting too old and fat 
for this business.” 

He shuddered, his paunch 
quaking. Farrell guessed that he 
was thinking of what woqld have 
happened to them if Gibson had 
been as susceptible as they to the 
overpowering fascination of the 
moths. A few more chrysalids to 
open in the spring, an extra litter 
of bones to puzzle the next Recla- 
mations crew . 

“That should do it,” Gibson 
said. He shut off the flow of in- 
secticide and the mass-converter 
grew silent in the engine room 
below. “Exit another Hymenop 
experiment in bastard synecol- 

ogy.” 

“I can understand how they 
might find, or breed, a nocturnal 
moth with breeding-season con- 
trol over human beings,” Farrell 
said. “And how they’d balance 
the relationship to a time-cycle 
that kept the host species alive, 
yet never let it reach maturity. 
But what sort of principle would 
give an instinctive species com- 
pulsive control over an intelligent 
one, Gib? And what did the Bees 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



get out of the arrangement in the 
first place?” 

Gibson shrugged. “We’ll under- 
stand the principle when — or if — 
we learn how the wasp holds its 
spider helpless. Until then, we 
can only guess. As for identify- 
ing the motive that prompted the 
Hymenops to set up such a bal- 
ance, I doubt that we ever will. 
Could a termite understand why 
men build theaters?” 

“There’s a possible parallel in 
that,” Stryker suggested. “May- 
be this was the Hymenop idea of 
entertainment. They might have 
built the bridge as balconies, 
where they could see the show.” 
“It could have been a business 
venture,” Farrell suggested. 
“Maybe they raised the moth 
larvae or pupae for the same rea- 
son we raise poultry. A sort of 
insectile chicken ranch.” 

“Or a kennel,” Gibson said dry- 
ly. “Maybe they bred moths for 
pets, as we breed dogs.” 

Farrell grimaced sickly, revolt- 
ed by the thought. “A pet farm? 
God, what a diet to feed them!” 



chanical’s featureless face. 

“What do you think, Xav?” he 
demanded. “What sort of motive 
would you say prompted the Hy- 
menops to set up such a bal- 
ance?” 

“Evaluation of alien moti- 
vations, conversely the me- 
chanical said, finishing the 
Reclamations Handbook quota- 
tion which Stryker had begun 
much earlier, “is essentially im- 
possible because there can be no 
common ground of comprehen- 
sion.” 

It centered the tray neatly on 
the charting table and stood back 
in polite but unmenial deference 
while they sucked at their coffee- 
bulbs. 

“A greater mystery to me,” 
Xavier went on, “is the congeni- 
tal restlessness that drives men 
from their own comfortable 
worlds to such dangers as you 
have met with here. How can I 
understand the motivations of an 
alien people? I do not even un- 
derstand those of the race that 
built me.” 

The three men looked at each 
other blankly, disconcerted by the 
ancient problem so unexpectedly 
posed. 

It was Stryker who sheepishly 
answered it. 

“That’s nothing for you to wor- 
ry about, Xav,” he said wryly. 
“Neither do we.”

HINTS TO FUTURE 
ARCHEOLOGISTS 

1 AST fall, on Martha’s Vine- 
yard island, I climbed 
around on a minor mys- 
tery. Atop the clay mountains of 
Gay Head, the westernmost point 
of the island, there is a tall wire 
fence, now open. Inside that wire 
fence is a nice solid concrete 
platform, about 15 feet by 15

tl 




feet in size and a foot or so in 
thickness. Underneath, in the 
clay ground, a kind of basement 
has been dug with steel posts that 
carry the platform. The local 
guide tells tourists that this was 
built during the first World War 
with the greatest amount of 
secrecy possible. To this day, 
nobody knows what purpose it 
served or whether it was used at 
all. 

While standing on the plat- 
form, I thought that when the 
date of construction eventually is 
forgotten, people will be likely to 
explain it as a launching plat- 
form for V-2 type rockets, for it 
certainly resembles one. And then 
my mind jumped to Sprague de 
Camp’s favorite short lecture 
that answers the question “How 
do you science fiction writers get 
your ideas?” and I thought that 
this would be a nice puzzler for 
a planetographer from the Rigel- 
ian star system. Five minutes 
later, I reconsidered. You don’t 
have to go out into space. Just 
let a few centuries elapse right 
here on Earth and archeologists 
of our own kind will come across 
some beautiful brain-twisters, 
puzzles they’ll never be able to 
solve unless still-preserved rec- 
ords help them. 

^OR example, archeologists 
digging in southern England 
will find iron spheres. First one 



or two, then — having brought 
magnetic detectors into play — 
six more here, three more there, 
a total of about two dozen. Be- 
ing careful archeologists, they 
will notice at once that all these 
spheres form a straight line, dis- 
regarding trivial lateral displace- 
ments that obviously took place 
later. 

Their spacing is another prob- 
lem, however, for it doe? not 
seem to follow any pattern. 

The archeologists will then re- 
move the spheres to the labora- 
tory, for measurement and 
testing. 

In size, the iron spheres are all 
35.6 inches in diameter, with 
very minor variations. But they 
differ in weight. Expressed in 
terms of the “old” English pound, 
they weigh 2365 lbs., 2400 lbs., 
2500 lbs., and 2990 lbs. Since even 
the heaviest of these is too light 
for a solid cast iron sphere of 
35.6 inches, they must be hol- 
low. So a couple are sliced open 
with great care and under re- 
mote control. 

Yes, they are hollow and each 
opened sphere contains a little 
less than 500 lbs. of a crumbling 
powdery substance. The stuff 
does not explode. It does not even 
ignite well. It merely smolders 
under a sufficiently hot flame. 

Throwing a sample in a beaker 
of water, one man finds that it 
separates, much of it sinking to

the bottom while the smaller 
portion floats. What sinks to the 
bottom looks like sand. Chemi- 
cal analysis shows that it is sand. 
The stuff that floats shows the 
cellular structure of wood under 
the microscope and is subjected 
to age analysis by the carbon- 14 
method. Analysis says the trees 
were cut down in 1860 A. D., 
with a possible error of plus or 
minus 15 years. 

But what are those things? 
The cannon balls used in the 19th 
Century, the archeologists know, 
rarely exceeded' four inches in 
diameter and were solid iron. 
And, even accepting for a mo- 
ment the preposterous theory that 
they were projectiles, they would 
have been filled with a mixture 
of charcoal, sulfur and saltpeter, 
not with sand and chips of wood 
(uncharred) about two milli- 
meters long and a half millimeter 
in thickness. 

Well, the big balls actually 
were projectiles. 

The long line of about two 
dozen of them were the test 
rounds fired from a single wea- 
pon, one of two super-mortars 
which had originally been or- 
dered by the British Ordnance 
Department for the pursuit of 
the Crimean War. That the balls 
were filled with 480 lbs. of sand 
and sawdust was merely a prov- 
ing ground safety measure. The 
ordnance’ men were testing the 



guns, not the projectiles. 

The large mortars were the 
invention of a Mr. Robert Mallet, 
who suggested that they be 
mounted on barges or rafts to 
bombard troops ashore. The nev- 
elty was that the barrels were 
not cast, but consisted of a 
number of longitudinal bars, held 
together by rings and tightened 
by clamps and bolts. 

The authorities to whom he 
submitted his plan did not think 
much of the idea, but Mr. Mallet 
somehow got the ear of Lord 
Palmerston, the First Minister of 
the Crown, and a tough letter 
written by Lord Palmerston on 
May 2nd, 1855, made the Lieu- 
tenant General of Ordnance take 
care of the matter personally. 

"OEQUESTS for bids were sent 
-■■^out within 24 hours and, 
when a bid came in, it was ac- 
cepted within 12 hours! Unfor- 
tunately the firm which had sent 
in the bid went bankrupt before 
the two mortars were finished 
and another firm had to take 
over. All this delayed the delivery 
period — instead of the ten weeks 
promised by the first firm, it 
took a total of 96 weeks. By then 
the war was over and the Chief of 
Ordnance asked for an account- 
ing sheet. He did not like what 
he read. 

The bid for the mortars had 
been 4000 pounds sterling for 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



each, provided it weighed not 
more than 35 tons, with 140 
pounds sterling for each addition- 
al ton. The two mortars weighed 
40 tons apiece. The forty-odd 
projectiles cast by another firm 
cost 16 pounds sterling per ton. 
Two loading cranes cost 150 
'pounds sterling each. And the 
laying of just one platform for 
test firing was to cost 450 pounds 
sterling. 

So it was decided to build only 
one platform and to test only 
one of the two mortars. The first 
test was made October 19, 1857, 
with a propelling charge of only 
ten pounds of coarse cannon 
powder. Range: 370 yards. The 
charge was doubled and the range 
increased to 900 yards. Round 
No. 7 with 70 lbs. of cannon 
powder carried to a distance of 
2644 yards. Then something 
broke and had to be repaired. 
In December, 1857, there were 
more tests — one of them resulted 
in the first photograph of a pro- 
jectile in flight — and something 
broke again. This went on until 
July, 1858, when a range of 2759 
yards was reached and something 
else broke. 

The new Chief of Ordnance, 
General Peel, refused to spend 
any more cash on this project — 
not a farthing more, he declared. 
(He did authorize an expenditure 
of 12 shillings and sixpence 
eleven years later, which was for 



guncotton to blast apart the 
piece.) As for the projectiles fired. 
Nos. 1, 4 and 15 were found. The 
engineers would have liked to 
dig the others up, too, but when 
General Peel learned that this 
would cost 22 pounds sterling 
apiece, he decided to leave them 
in the ground. 

They are still there, at an esti- 
mated depth of 30 feet below the 
surface of the soil. 

In the case of the big round 
bombs from the Mallet mortar, 
future archeologists might still 
puzzle it out — if they happen 
to know that the area was once 
an artillery proving ground. But 
one day they may come across 
several hundred yards of pipe, 
resting on the ocean bottom near 
the northern shore of Cuba. Ev- 
erything about it will be puzzling, 
beginning with the question of 
what that length of pipe is doing 
in the ocean. This might be ex- 
plained by saying that it may 
have been jettisoned by a freight- 
er in distress or that i,t had been 
a tow cargo which broke loose. 
But for whatever reason it may 
have been lost, what was its in- 
tended purpose^ 

A FTER scraping off all the 
marine life which has as- 
sembled on the relic inside and 
out, the archeologists will find 
that it was not only long but also 
big, about five feet in diameter

on the inside. The material is 
clearly sheet steel, but of a wall 
thickness that is ridiculously 
small compared to its size. That 
pipe could not have carried any 
pressure on the inside and it 
could not have withstood any 
pressure from the outside. But it 
must have been meant to carry 
something, and presumably 
something hot, because it was 
wrapped in heat-insulating ma- 
terials. 

The explanation is that this 
pipe once was a part of an inter- 
esting experiment conducted 
(and paid for) by the French 
physicist and inventor Georg 
Claude in collaboration with the 
engineer Paul Boucherot. 

It all began some time back — 
to be precise, with an article in 
the September 17, 1881, issue of 
the French scientific magazine 
Revue scientiBque. The article 
was written by Professor Jacques 
Arsene d’Arsonval, who later ac- 
quired fame as an electrical re- 
searcher. But this early work of 
his did not concern electricity. 
Rather, it dealt with a novel 
form of “steam” engine. 

Professor d’Arsonval first stat- 
ed for the benefit of those readers 
who were not engineers that any 
engine works on a difference in 
temperature levels. The steam in 
a boiler is “hot.” The outside air, 
by comparison, is “cold.” But it 
matters little what the two temp- 



eratures involved are in degrees 
of centigrade or Fahrenheit. What 
is important is that there is a 
differencei Nor is it necessary 
that this difference be as great as 
it usually is in a steam engine. 

Take the Warm Spring of 
Grenelle, for example, he continu- 
ed. Its waters have a temperature 
of 86° Fahrenheit (I am con- 
verting: actually he used centi- 
grade, of course) and the water of 
a river nearby has usually a 
temperature of 60° Fahrenheit, 
often less. So there is a difference 
of at least 26° Fahrenheit, often 
more. If one immersed a boiler 
in the Spring of Grenelle and 
cooled the condenser in the river, 
once would have 26° Fahrenheit 
to work on. This' wouldn’t do 
anything if you had water in the 
boiler, but if you filled the boiler 
with sulfur dioxide, you would 
obtain a pressure difference of 
about 20 lbs. per square inch and 
this would be enough to do useful 
work. 

Nor does one need a warm 
spring for this scheme, d’Arsonval 
added. The boiler could be in a 
normal “cold” river if the con- 
denser is packed in ice. Or the 
boiler could be at the surface in 
a warm ocean and the condenser 
at the bottom of the same ocean, 
for the bottom water of all oceans 
has a temperature of 39-40° Fah- 
renheit while the surface, in the 
tropics, is warmed to 75-80° F.

The readers of the Revue scien- 
tifique probably thought this an 
amusing idea. They most likely 
checked the figures and found 
them correct, but they saw no 
reason to go on from there. Steam 
engines worked and one day, 
maybe, those who were after 
engines running on coal gas might 
succeed, too. 

AT a somewhat later date, 
however, several engineers 
tried their slide rules on the 
problem of the extraction of en- 
ergy from small temperature 
level differences. The first after 
d’Arsonval was the American 
William Campbell in 1913, then 
the two Italians Boggi and Dor- 
nig htld, in 1925, the German Dr. 
E. Brauer. None of them was in 
a position to build expensive ma- 
chinery. George Claude, inventor 
of the neon tube and successful 
pioneer in other fields, was in a 
more favored situation. 

Claude had evolved the same 
chain of reasoning as d’Arsonval, 
but doubted whether a special 
working fluid was really needed. 
Water will boil at 70° Fahren- 
heit, provided the atmospheric 
pressure is lowered. 

To test his contention, Claude 
used two large narrow-necked 
glass jugs. Jug No. 1 was filled 
to about one-quarter of its capa- 
city with water at a temperature 
of 82° Fahrenheit, the tempera- 



ture of surface water in a tropical 
sea. From the neck of this jug, 
a pipe led to a small turbine in 
the second jug. The turbine was 
coupled with a tiny generator 
and from there wires led to three 
flashlight bulbs. The bottom of 
the second jug was covered by a 
layer of crushed ice, with the 
neck connected to an air pump. 
The air pump lowered the pres- 
sure in both jugs to three per 
cent of normal atmospheric pres- 
sure, when the valve was closed. 

By that time, the warm water 
in jug No. 1 was boiling furious- 
ly, the turbine spun and the three 
bulbs burned brightly. The spent 
steam condensed on the crushed 
ice. 

Heartened by this success, Paul 
Boucherot, the engineer of the 
team, spent some of Claude’s 
money on a 50 KW generator, 
built a steam turbine and the 
necessary auxiliary equipment 
and assembled the whole near 
some blast furnaces in Belgium. 
The cooling water of the blast 
furnaces was the heat source. The 
river Meuse supplied the cold 
water for the condenser. The 
temperature difference was 36° 
Fahrenheit. 

The machinery ran for the first 
time on April 29, 1928, and meas- 
urements proved that the auxili- 
ary equipment (especially the air 
pump) used only one-quarter of 
the power generated.

>T^HE next step was to run this 
with ocean water. After a 
preliminary search, the Bay of 
Matanzas, about 50 miles to the 
east of Havana, was picked. 

There had to be three, pipes. 
One to take in warm surface 
water. One to discharge the used 
water. And one was to bring cold 
water from the bottom to the 
surface. 

The last pipe was the big 
problem.' It had to be insulated 
so that the cold water would not 
absorb heat on the way up. And 
it had to be quite long to reach 
down to cold water — 1.2 miles, to 
be exact. Since Claude wanted to 
use this most expensive item of 
the whole in a later and bigger 
unit, he made it quite large, five 
feet in diameter, although a one- 
foot pipe might have been large 
enough for the unit that had been 
brought from Belgium. 

It was then that a streak of 
bad luck began. The first long 
pipe was lost because the ropes 
broke and it sank to a depth be- 
yond accessibility by divers. The 
second kinked and developed a 
leak that could not be repaired. 
The third was put into place in 
September, 1930, but it was too 
short. The “cold" water came in 
at 58° Fahrenheit, so that the 
temperature difference which 
could and should have been 50° 
Fahrenheit was a mere 24° F. 
The equipment still ran, but it 



produced only a little over 40 
per cent of the rated output. 

Claude had to buy power from 
the local power company to run 
the auxiliary equipment! 

And that is how a large and 
strange pipe got to be on the 
bottom of the ocean near the 
shore of Cuba. 

The rest of the story does not 
take long to tell. Claude was ad- 
vised by Dr. Brauer and others 
that it had been wrong to work 
with low-pressure water vapor 
and that he should adopt d’Ar- 
sonval’s proposal or use ammonia 
as a working fluid. But Claude 
blamed everything on the loca- 
tion on the shore and put his next 
set of machinery on a steamer, 
the 10,000 ton Tunisie. Again it 
worked badly and in the end 
Claude, in disgust, scuttled his 
equipment. 

I can’t report the “consensus of 
experts” because only a small 
number of men have thought 
about this problem to any extent. 
But the few whose opinion I 
know do not believe that Claude’s 
failure proves that it cannot be 
done. They think — and said — it 
merely proves that it cannot be 
done with Claude’s equipment. 

ANY QUESTIONS? 

A car is traveling along a road 
at about 30 mph. A fly which has 
been sitting on a back seat rises, 



78 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



hovers in the air for a morhent, 
flies toward the front of the car 
and lands on the dashboard. The 
fly, while hovering, was com- 
pletely removed from the car, 
yet was not flying at 30 mph. 
Which scientific rule or law cov- 
ers this situation? 

John Lanctot 
159 Park St. 
Burlington, Vt. 

This is an old one and of the 
same kind as the following: 
“’A fly in an empty Itottle is per- 
fectly halanred on a jeweler’s 
scale as long as it is sitting 
down inside the bottle. What 
happens if the fly starts flying 
inside the bottle?” The answer 
is nothing for the weight of 
the fly stills rests on the air 
inside the bottle. 

Similarly, in the moving car 
— pro\ ided it is a closed car — 
it is moving along at the rate of 
30 mph. While the “air speed” 
of the fly in flying from the 
hack seat to the dashboard may 
he just about three mph, its 
“ground speed” is 33 mph. 

Could meltings polar ice cause 
the ocean to rise enough to en- 
danger coastal areas? 

Tom Treadwell 
22SN. I2th 
Springfield, Oregon 

The answer to this question 
depends almost entirely on the 
circumstances you have in 



mind. I think someone calculat- 
ed that if all the polar ice on 
both poles were melted, the 
oceans would rise hy about 20 
feet. This, of course, would en- 
danger a number of coastal 
areas. But the assumptions of 
this calculation are that (A) 
all the ice is melte^l and (B) 
that it happens suddenly. 

In reality, neither the one 
nor the other could take place. 
INor would all the water go into 
the oceans directly. Much of it 
wouhl enter the atmosphere 
an<l condense on high moun- 
tain chains so that the result 
would be longer and thicker 
glaciers wherever glaciers 
form, the inland lakes would 
increase in depth and size, the 
underground water table would 
be raised, and so forth. 

The overall result of a grad- 
ual melting of the polar caps 
would likely be an increase of 
the depth of the oceans of only 
a few feet, which would be felt 
in a very few places. 

The only portion of the spec- 
trum visible to the human eye is 
the portion beginning with red 
and ending with violet. But it 
seems conceited to me to believe 
that these are the only colors 
which exist in Nature. Are there 
any substances colored infra-red 
or ultra-violet, or would it be 
possible to manufacture infra-red 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION

or ultra-violet pigments? And 
how would such pigments appear 
to the naked eye? 

John Siegel 
21-10, 202nd St. 
Bayside 60, N. Y. 

To avoid the semantic con- 
fusion which is imbedded in 
this question, let’s begin at the 
beginning. Our atmosphere is 
especially transparent to those 
rays which lie between what we 
call red and violet. As living be- 
ings evolved, their eyes logi- 
cally acquired sensitivity to the 
rays which were around in mas- 
sive doses, though these eyes 
did not necessarily distinguish 
color. (A surprising number of 
highly evolved mammals are to- 
tally color blind.) As for infra- 
red, we are sensitive to these 
rays, hut our sensory organs 
interpret them as heat. 

In short, then, “colors” are 
what we see and distinguish as 
colors. What is beyond the col- 
ored portion of the spectrum 
is still radiation that might 
have optical effects, like ultra- 
violet on a photographic plate, 
but only in terms of light and 
dark, not at all in terms of 
color. 

Would you please explain how 
the gravitational pull of the 
Moon can cause tides on both 
sides of the Earth at the same 
time? And does the Sun cause 



any ’ tides of the Earth’s oceans 
or is it too far away? 

James L. Coleman 
538 St. John’s Rd. 
Toronto 9, Ont., Canada 

The tide-raising action of the 
Moon is best understood if we 
first imagine a line drawn from 
the center of the Moon to the 
center of the Earth and then 
continued through the Earth. 

The ocean directly under the 
Moon around the line is some- 
what .deformed, rising in the 
Moon’s direction by about one 
yard. (The much higher tides 
observed near the shore are 
due to a ’^funneling” action of 
the shoreline, especially in 
slowly constricting spaces like 
the Bay of Fundy.) Then the 
Earth as a whole yields some- 
what to the Moon’s attraction, 
so that the ocean directly away 
from the Moon, where the 
center-connecting line touches 
the surface again, is “left be- 
hind,” forming a second de- 
formation that is not quite as 
high as the one on the Moon- 
ward side. 

Because the Earth turns 
much more rapidly than the 
Moon travels around the Earth, 
these two bulges seem to travel 
around the Earth. They do not 
actually travel; it is simply that 
the ocean near that center-to- 
center line is deformed. 

The tide-raising power of the 



80 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Sun 18 much less than that of 
the Moon, hut it is measurable. 
When the solar bulges coincide 
with the lunar bulges (at 
‘‘new” Moon and at full Moon), 
the tides are higher than nor- 
mal. When a lunar bulge hits 
a solar “low,” the tides are less 
than normal. 

Why IS it that no meteorites 
hit the Earth now, or hardly ever 
in the present time? 

John Guild 
2809 Burdick Rd. 

Oak Bay, Victoria, B.C. 

The Earth is being hit stead- 
ily by a hail of meteorites, but 
the vast majority of them are 
about the size of grains of very 
fine sand and burn away before 
they reach the surface. Really 
big meteorites, weighing a ton 
or more, are great rarities and 
seem to have been rare in the 
past, too. In the present cen- 
tury, there have been just two 
known large meteorites. Both 
of them struck in Siberia, the 
last one in 1947. But three- 
quarters of the Earth's surface 
is water and there are huge un- 
inhabited land areas from* 
which we wouldn't get any re- 
ports. The odds, as you can see, 
are against meteorite strikes in 
civilized territory, in case any- 
body happens to be worrying 
about it.

D r. carl WAHL (intern) 
skimmed over the high- 
lights of the Worksheet, 
Mental Status, as it strove^ pre- 
sumptuously to fix the outlines of 
a human personality — and . an 
off-beat one at that: 

PATIENT’S NAME: (Maj.) Angus 
G. Burnside. AGE: 57. DOCTOR: 
Wm. Svindorff, Dr. Matthew Loftus 
in attendance. 

GENERAL HISTORY: Army En- 
gineers, specialist electric communica- 
tions. Retired small Catskill estate 



1949. No record of major trauma or 
disease. KIN : Married, Ruth Elvira, 
nee Barker, aged 35, she says. Relation- 
ship amicable but somewhat distant. 

Attitude: Quiet, cooperative. Per- 
sonal habits meticulous. Permitted un- 
limited access to books and electronic 
materials. Coherent outside limits of 
his mania. EMOTIONAL REACTION. 
AFFECT : Calm, amused at his own 
situation. NATURE OF ABERRA- 
TION : Believes inanimate objects dis- 
play active hostility. This is not 
directed at himself personally. In fact, 
he believes he can orcumvent it more 
readily than most, but expresses con- 
cern for safety of the human race. 
Discusses this belief with scholarship 





and detachnfjent. EXAMPLES: Said 
to nurse (Miss Clements) : “Your 

apron-bow is waiting to pick some- 
thing off that tray.” Said to me 
(Loftus) ; “I’d fix that loose heel if I 
were you. If it hasn’t thrown you yet, 
it’s just waiting for an opportunity to 
really break your neck.” 

“Well, hell!” said Dr. Carl 
Wahl. “That’s just a picturesque 
way of expressing commonplace 
facts. He sees .something that’s 
liable to cause an accident, and 
personifies it. Why put a mild 
eccentric like that in here, when 
we can’t accommodate urgent 
cases?” 

Dr. Matthew Loftus (resident) 
grimaced: “Since you ask, I’ll 
agree it stinks. Of course, those 
excerpts don’t give you any real 
idea. He’s as psychotic as a jay- 
bird, no doubt at all. He conducts 
himself entirely according to this 
fixation. And he’s got it all work- 
ed out in theory, too; damnedest 
stuff you ever heard, plausible as 
only a complete psychotic can 
be — half convinces you, till you 
get away from his spell and have 
a chance to think. But I agree . 
he certainly shouldn’t be here.” 

Wahl put the Worksheet on 
Matt Loftus’s desk, looking inter- 
ested. “You would draw the only 
ripsnorter with big ideas in this 
grab-bag of catatonics and de- 
ments.” 

“Not to mention dipsos and 
plain stumblebums,” Matt Loftus 
grinned. “And that old lady who 



makes immoral paper dolls.” He 
looked at the sheet almost fond- 
ly. “A little old-fashioned, poetic 
madness is rather refreshing, isn’t 
it? And Angus Burnside is a gen- 
tleman and scholar of some old 
school, and a most engaging con- 
versationalist. I frequent his lair 
considerably more than is strictly 
required. Tell you what, Carl . 
I’ll take you on as consultant, if 
you’re interested. You could get 
next to him on music; he’s got a 
terrific audio system up there, 
and he actually plays it as much 
as he tinkers with it. Best com- 
pany in the institute.” 

“That,” said Carl Wahl, “is a 
deal.” 

^^HAT afternoon, after a non- 
-*■ institutional knock and a po- 
lite summons from within, the two 
men entered the Major’s room. 
Large by local standards, it could 
have been a good hotel-room- 
with-bath, except for the barred 
windows and general starkness. 
The chintzy curtains, cheery rugs, 
and optimistic pictures usually 
found in high-class mental wards 
were absent, replaced with dialed 
cabinets, a long shelf of records 
and tape spools, and an electri- 
cian’s workbench of impressive 
resources. 

The occupant, rising from the 
bench to face his visitors, would 
have dominated a much more 
distracting environment— say, an

amphibious retreat under enemy 
fire. He was a lean, brown man; 
his hair was silver but thick; his 
white mustache was clipped with 
extreme precision. His gray eyes 
were merry and kind, however: 
in that amphibious debacle, he 
would be the type to rescue men 
physically by diving in, or men- 
tally with acrid jests. Carl’s prac- 
ticed glance could note none of 
the little tics or rigidities that 
often betray underlying disloca- 
tion of nerves or mind. 

The Major immediately put 
everybody on terms of informal 
equality by displaying the wire- 
less relay he was arranging be- 
tween his phonograph amplifier 
and speaker. Then, with the 
smartness of a precision-drill 
squad, he clicked back into racks 
and drawers the few tools and bits 
of material in use, and turned to 
Carl with disconcerting candor: 
“I suppose you want to hear my 
theory — or mania? Fine! Make 
yourselves comfortable.” 

Matt draped himself on the 
bed and Carl took an armchair. 
The two were a complete con- 
trast: Matt, behind a youthful 
face and mild voice, kept in am- 
bush a mind as incisive as an 
electric scalpel; Carl, raw-boned 
and lank-haired, was a very re- 
liable citizen, but he harbored a 
quiet mysticism that was often 
invaluable in establishing rapport 
with the mentally unconventional. 

INANIMATE OBJECTION 



“I’ll ask you,” the Major be- 
gan, “to consider my thesis as 
dispassionately as our relative 
positions will allow. For a start, 
perhaps you’ll admit that any 
notion, however apparently fan- 
tastic, that has been held by 
many ages and cultures is worth 
scientific investigation, if only to 
explain it away.” 

They nodded. 

“Good,” said the Major. “Now, 
few notions have been so univer- 
sally held as the one I shall dis- 
cuss : that what we call inanimate 
objects have a will of their own. 
The ancients endowed them with 
spirits — lares, oreads and so on. 
Medieval alchemists described 
an elaborate, if largely arbitrary, 
system of sympathies and antipa- 
thies — not personification, but 
something far subtler. Modern 
science simply shrugs: fantasies 
of dawning reason. An opinion 
without proof, I submit. In the 
last war our fliers, the flower of 
the mechanical age, devised the 
Gremlins — ^whole fun and half 
earnest — for they sensed some- 
thing more than a chance me- 
chanical failure . some Thing 
malicious and aggressive.” 

^ARL was attentively analyz- 
ing manner as well as matter : 
The Major’s logic was certainly 
off the gold standard — ^the case 
built on random gleanings, the 
disregard for alternative possibili- 

85 



ties. Yet certain psychotic quali- 
ties were lacking; the grandiose 
seriousness, the touchiness, the 
air of knock-down argument. 
And, an inner mentor reminded, 
the ability to select significant de- 
tail was often the trademark of 
genius: “great wits are oft to 
madness near allied . .” 

“Of course,” the Major con- 
tinued, “the idea flouts sacred 
axioms. But, after all . sacred? 
Science is study of evidence, not 
recitation of a creed. And aren’t 
the axioms being badly strained? 
‘If you knew all the physical fac- 
tors, you could explain every- 
thing.’ Safe enough, since you 
never will know them. But your 
axioms work to a high approxi- 
mation in certain carefully se- 
lected and managed cases, so you 
reject all other explanations for 
everything, in the name of a 
spurious unity.” 

So he did consider alternatives, 
Carl thought. Aloud, he asked, 
“What evidence exists for any 
other explanations?” 

“Ha! That’s exactly my 
‘mania.’ By the theory of proba- 
bility, you get a straight flush in 
every-so-many poker hands. But 
what if straight flushes crop up 
all over?” 

Matt objected: “We’ve already 
discussed how easily you can 
prove dreams are prophetic if you 
record the ones that turn out and 
disregard the rest, and so on.” 



“True enough. And you can 
prove tigers’ claws or 17-desoxy- 
bethylene are miracle-drugs, if 
you stress the cures and explain 
away the regrettable fatalities.” 

“Touche,” said Matt. “Fire 
ahead.” 

“Also, I’ve already admitted 
that my weak point is getting 
things on a statistical basis. I’ve 
been collecting data for years — ” 
he gestured toward a row of fat 
notebooks beside his records — 
“but things like poker hands, 
which you can tabulate easily, are 
obviously least likely to illustrate 
my point — they’re too simple, 
mechanically, to enjoy much 
freedom of action. Besides . .” 
He smiled faintly. 

“Go on,” said Matt. “You 
think this is a weak link . 
sounds irrational. Seriously, it 
impressed me as genuine observa- 
tion.” 

“Glad to know it. Doctor. Well, 
you know that the presence of an 
observer changes conditions so 
you can’t know what would have 
happened with no observer. That 
won’t perceptibly affect motion of 
a falling body, or other such ele- 
mentary cases. But in complex, 
versatile systems, I believe the 
effect increases enormously. I be- 
lieve physical processes know 
they’re being observed and evade 
analysis — I’m using ‘know’ as en- 
gineers do when they use the ex- 
pression ‘How does the valve 



86 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



know force is applied?’ ” 

Carl was drawn off guard: 
“There’s a traffic light at Tenth 
and Capitol I swear goes red just 
as I reach it — oh, four times in 
five. I tried keeping count once, 
and I’m certain the frequency 
changed while I was doing it.” 
“More likely your car than the 
light. Anyway, there you are. If 
you can’t get statistics, you have 
to fall back on intuition, and 
that isn’t science.” 

“Well, then,” Carl made 
amends to his professional con- 
science, “there isn’t much point 
bothering with it, is there?” 
“Sometimes I fear not. But if 
enough people were thinking 
along those lines, someone might 
hit on a way to fool the resistance. 
Anyway, amuse yourself apply- 
ing my theory and see how it 
fits.” The Major dismissed the 
topic and talked electronics for 
the rest of the visit. 

“■^^ELL,” Matt grinned after- 
”ward, “isn’t that a honey 
of a mania? His science is top- 
drawer stuff, too. Tell you what: 
I’ll lay you a dollar even that 
you’ll be taking him ‘whole fun 
and half earnest,’ as he puts it, 
by Christmas. I know you won’t 
cheat for that little: in fact, 
knowing you, it’ll make you con- 
fess if you weaken.” 

Carl laughed and took him up. 
Which meant that he had to take 



the Major’s suggestion at least in 
half earnest. But he needed 
amusement. In addition to a 
merciless load of work at an in- 
stitute half destaffed by flu, he 
■had worries: his wife Clare, of 
whom he was somewhat fond, 
had the flu too, followed by pneu- 
monia and complicated by aller- 
gic reaction to the antibiotics 
applied. Having had a fortnight 
off during the emergency, he 
could not decently get down to 
their little apartment more than 
once or twice in the next fort- 
night, and he was a type who 
worried quietly but effectively. 
He found Major Burnside’s fan- 
tasy a distraction, and even hoped 
it would later appeal to Clare’s 
lively sense of humor. 

So he collected instances: The 
dollar pencil that dropped on its 
rubber and vaulted into the 
plumbless depths of a hot-air 
register; the tiny rip in the sleeve 
of his white jacket that snagged 
on the tap of a coffee-urn, caus- 
ing him to slop a cup of scalding 
coffee over trousers and ankle; 
the page of vital report that blew 
off his worktable and slid craftily 
behind a newspaper in the waste- 
basket; and a dozen more com- 
monplace acts of malice by 
familiar objects. 

He had to convince himself 
that the laws of chance adequate- 
ly covered each incident; but also 
he had to grapple with underly- 



NANIMATE OBJECTION 



87 



ing implications. So Sunday after- 
noon he seized a breathing-space 
to go up, armed with a clearance 
from Matt, to reason with the 
Major. 

“Look here, sir,” he began. 
“Gathering data is the first step, 
but you’ve got to have some gen- 
eral theory. Ruling out literal 
Gremlins, why should objects be 
actively hostile?” 

The Major looked up from a 
soldering job, with a twinkle: “If 
I give you a theory, will you be 
the least bit more persuaded? All 
right: Why do we like organiza- 
tion, control, applied power?” 

Carl reflected: “Oh ... I sup- 
pose it’s the nature of life to ex- 
tend itself by organization of the 
environment — tools and so on.” 

“Excellent. Well, the mass of 
the Universe behaves in exactly 
the opposite way — disorganizing, 
devolving. Any reason why this 
much vaster process shouldn’t 
have — well, a sort of counter-life? 
Well, then, to it, our organ- 
izing activities would be equiva- 
lent to fires, contrary winds, rust. 
Up to a few thousand years ago, 
the effects of life were trivial — a 
little photosynthesis and burrow- 
digging that mattered no more to 
counter-life than geological ero- 
sion matters to us. But now Man 
is organizing matter and energy 
on an expanding scale — a regu- 
lar epidemic of natural disasters 
to counter-life. So, of course, it 



resists and fights back.” 

“Hold on!” Carl protested. 
“After all, our activities cause in- 
creased breakdown of material, 
on the whole. That should be 
gratifying to it, not disconcert- 
mg. 

“Yes — but we organize some 
matter very highly, and might 
eventually reverse the whole 
trend. Anyway, the further we go, 
the more opposition we gener- 
ate.” 

“Pretty trivial opposition. Gue- 
rilla warfare.” 

The Major smiled. “Napoleon 
and Hitler were softened up for 
the real counter-offensive by gue- 
rilla warfare. How much of your 
life does it waste, for example?” 

^ARL thought that over. That 
^ morning, he had lost half an 
hour over a broken shoelace, a 
shaving-cream cap that escaped 
down the sink, a shirt-collar loop 
that refused to hitch over its but- 
ton, and a handful of money that 
scattered jubilantly when his 
trouser pocket snared a finger. 
He had accordingly breakfasted 
on peanuts and, on ward rounds, 
had covered himself with medi- 
ocrity in lihe eyes of Dr. Svin- 
dorff. 

He changed his point of attack 
— or perhaps fell back on his own 
second line? 

“But how does it work?” he 
asked. “I mean, we know the laws

of mechanics, and they don’t 
leave scope for free action.” 

“Oh, don’t they? We operate 
by chemistry, and yet we feel we 
have plenty of freedom. Simple 
mechanical systems made of doc- 
ile materials don’t have much 
freedom, true. But we can’t ex- 
trapolate that fact to cover all 
cases.” 

“Docile materials?” 

“Metals, for example. Passive, 
like plant life. And we cast them 
in geometric forms. And even 
then they trick us. We get endless 
amusement out of games played 
with the simplest geometric form 
of all, the sphere, from billiards 
to baseball. What do we know of 
possibilities in really subtle sys- 
tems of matter — fabrics, paper, 
rubber, ready to rebound from 
the almost organic forms forced 
on them?” 

“Hm! Aren’t those organic ma- 
terials?” 

“£xorganic. What populations 
are more fanatical for liberty than 
those that have just been liberat- 
ed from obnoxious control? And 
note this: We organize matter 
only for special purposes: matter 
tries to waste our energies out of 
systematic hostility. The aspirin 
tablet that eludes you and wastes 
two minutes of your time has 
won a victory in a battle we’re not 
even consciously fighting yet.” 
Carl rationed himself one last 
question — ^the topper: “Do you 



consider that individual objects 
have personality — ^that soldering 
iron, for instance?” 

“I have an impression they en- 
joy a sort of merged or coopera- 
tive mentality— but certain forms 
have more or less individuality 
too. This iron — ” He reached for 
it back-handed; his cuff touched 
a kink in the cord and the iron 
swiveled in its cradle to graze his 
wrist. He snatched his hand away, 
sending the iron clattering across 
the bench ; but he caught it neatly 
before it had singed the wood, 
and set it in the cradle as if he 
were handling a cobra. “Yes! 
That soldering iron — or its cord 
— has plenty of personality; one 
of the most treacherous tools I’ve 
ever owned. And you’ll notice 
how they use our very actions to 
thwart us, just as we use mechan- 
ical laws to make them act con- 
structively. Of course, clumsiness 
gives them opportunity. I should 
have switched that off.” 

Carl attributed the little acci- 
dent to autosuggestion, a Freud- 
ian slip, and went away shaking 
his head. He had never met so 
well-integrated a delusion. By 
heaven, he hadn’t found the flaw 
yet! He hoped it would amuse 
Clare — she was often mighty 
sharp at analyzing such things. 

I’^HE following evening was his 
night off. He entered the 
apartment house with two large 



INANIMATE OBJECTION

shopping bags of staples and 
Clare’s favorite delicacies, to find 
that he would have to heft them 
up six flights, the elevator being 
out of order. 

He set them, panting, on the 
floor of the seventh flight while he 
opened the door. The door-check 
resisted sullenly, and he had to 
put his heel in the opening while 
he scooped up the groceries. 

As he turned, something jerked 
violently at the small of his back 
— the belt of his trenchcoat some- 
how, impossibly, had snubbed 
over the doorknob. 

Surprise, as much as the jerk, 
unbalanced him. His other heel 
slipped on the waxed linoleum of 
the landing. He lurched against 



the door, which now yielded like 
a swooning maiden, and he dove 
into the living room, frantically 
trying to save the toppling bags. 
The belt let go with the timing of 
a trained athlete, and everything 
went flying. He snatched at the 
top of one bag, and the sturdy 
paper ripped like tissue. With his 
other hand he came down solidly 
on a carton of cream that had 
rolled to the precise spot requisite, 
like an outfielder intercepting a 
fly. 

Clare, in her bathrobe, came 
scurrying to the bedroom door, to 
find him arising from among the 
debris. The door had closed de- 
cisively on a bag of eggs; a small 
sack of flour, disgorging at one

corner, smirked raffishly against 
a sofa-leg. 

“Gracious!” Clare said, between 
mirth and peevishness. “Must 
you be clumsy?” 

Through Carl’s mind, before 
he realized it, flashed. Well, 
they're not going to make trouble 
between me and Clare! And he 
gave the soft answer that turneth 
away wrath. 

After supper, he tried to turn 
the episode to account by using 
it to introduce the Major’s fan- 
tasy. 

At the end, Clare said languid- 
ly, “Well, anyone who ever kept 
house wouldn’t think he was so 
crazy!” 

They spent the next hour swap-

ping instances: the row of books 
that always toppled the way you 
didn’t want them; the garment 
that slid silkily to the floor if one 
arm hung over an edge; the 
drawerful of articles that restack- 
ed themselves to wedge it shut; 
the ball of paper that avoided the 
gaping waste-basket and dove 
easily into the narrow cranny be- 
hind; the balcony door that nor- 
mally refused to latch and banged 
in every breeze, but that had 
swung shut and smartly locked 
her out ; and so on. 

It was fun and did amuse 
Clare; but afterward he wonder- 
ed if he should have put such 
fantastic ideas into her still fe- 
verish mind. Also, he worried 
about having humored the Major 
quite so far; it was really very 
unprofessional! 

Next day, however. Matt eased 
the latter burden considerably by 
V saying, “Dr. Svindorff is working 
on the Major’s case — at my in- 
stigation. We can’t prove that 
Ruth Elvira wants to enjoy his 
worldly goods in his absence; but 
there’s no more reason to keep 
him here than a million other 
harmless cranks. Let him exer- 
cise his persuasive powers on the 
public along with Flat-Earthers, 
telekineticists, and prophets of 
Judgment Day come Jan. 19 . 
though, personally. I’ll be sorry 
to lose him. I find him a diver- 
sion.” 



C ARL felt the same. Candidly, 
he was itching to lick the 
Major’s theory, over and above 
liking the man. But the odd hours 
they spent with the Major in his 
ward-cell-laboratory were de- 
voted to mere yarns: 

“ — The wind snagged his parka 
on this one stub of branch, and 
there he was haltered over a fiVe- 
hundred-foot drop, with the bliz- 
zard settling down . The jeep 
door knocked his glasses onto the 
one bit of rock within yards — 
thirty miles from town, dozens 
of hairpin bends, and the hills full 
of Huks— 

Amusing, but . against vio- 
lent backgrounds of far outposts, 
violent accidents seemed natural 
enough: while by contrast, the 
freaks of civilized life grew pale 
and trifling. The magnificent 
phantasmagoria seemed to be 
sinking in a swamp of believe-it- 
or-not curiosities. 

Half wishing to rescue things 
from anticlimax, Carl finally de- 
manded, “You called all this just 
so much guerilla action. What 
shape would the real offensive 
take?” 

The Major racked his tools 
and turned, as if the matter de- 
manded his full attention: “Isn’t 
it obvious? When we think of 
atomic war, we’re afraid of the 
blast and fires and secondary ra- 
diation. But, to my mind, the big 
danger comes afterward . Ever

drive down the Hudson, past 
those endless cliffs of apartment 
blocks, and wonder what would 
happen if a few power lines and 
water mains were cut, with no 
repair in sight? Lord! Those mil- 
lions would be strangled, thrown 
back on techniques they’d utterly 
forgotten, pitted against materials 
that had learned to — defend 
themselves.” 

“Yes,” Carl said slowly, “that 
would be an opportunity.” 

The Major sat down and clasp- 
ed his hands over a knee. 

“Look, Doctor, this may sound 
fantastic, but I’m mad anyway 
according to you. It’s calculated 
that there must be millions of 
habitable planets, of which many 
have had ample time to develop 
space travel. Yet we’ve never had 
a certified visitor. Why?” 

“I’ve heard it discussed. We’re 
just a minor unit on the outskirts, 
for one thing.” 

“Quite true,” the Major nod- 
ded. “Yet, if there were no more 
than a few hundred exploring 
races, surely one would have got- 
ten around to us. Isn’t it just 
possible that something dead- 
locks all life at a certain stage — 
some universal feed-back mecha- 
nism? And, on my theory, you 
can see what it would be — prog- 
ress piling up resistance from 
counter-life. Past a crucial point, 
you might tip the balance in favor 
of life — but we’re not nearly so 



close to that stage yet as we are 
to a blow-up. One slip, and we’re 
done.” 

“Well, wouldn’t thinkers on 
other worlds have seen the dan- 
ger, if it’s real?” 

“Oh, I’m not so conceited — 
or mad — as to suppose I’m the 
only mind in the Universe to 
notice the obvious. But one is 
likely to see it too late, or not 
be able to persuade his contemp- 
oraries. I’m not making much 
headway, am I?” 

Carl departed considerably re- 
lieved. You might come to take 
Gremlins half seriously, as per- 
sonifying an active principle be- 
hind freak accidents; but as a 
cosmic threat engulfing the 
world and myriads of populated 
planets, they were merely silly.* 
Carl suddenly felt himself back 
in daylight, free of the insidious 
suspicion that after all there 
might be something in what the 
old boy said. He knew once more 
that mechanics explained all ac- 
cidents, if you only had time and 
patience to analyze them. 

He said as much to Matt in 
the cafeteria. 

“So I lose my bet, do I?” Matt 
smiled wistfully: “Well, the bet’s 
off anyway . Dr. Svindorff says 
that Angus G. will be leaving be- 
fore Christmas. But I thought 
you were drifting toward his 
siren song. Weren’t you, honest- 
ly?”

“Out of idle amusement. It’s 
lost its fascination.” 

t^HAT afternoon, a phone call 
from Clare wiped out all other 
concerns. Clare had been out the 
day before, and gotten caught in 
the rain — now she had a misery 
and a temperature of 102. Carl 
felt a nasty qualm of apprehen- 
sion; even a poor psychiatrist 
knew that in these cases the real 
danger was in relapse. He mort- 
gaged his free time for the month 
ahead, and got the evening off. 

He arrived at the apartment to 
find Clare in bed with their elec- 
tric blanket huddled around her, 
not even trying to read. She greet- 
ed him with an anxiety that 
showed she too knew about re- 
lapses; “Do you think I’m going 
to be very sick?” 

“Not if we keep you warm and 
quiet.” He fixed the best light 
snacks he knew and fed her by 
hand. 

At the end, she suddenly asked, 
“How’s that old man with the 
theory about objects?” and has- 
tened on, not waiting for a reply, 
“He’s perfectly right.” 

She looked about fourteen, and 
valuable, bundled up with her 
brindled hair loose and her face 
worried. Carl scored himself for 
having filled her head with non- 
sense; though, of course, her fever 
would just have fastened on 
something else. 



He jollied her seriously: “Well, 
I think bacteria are more dan- 
gerous than objects, in your 
case.” 

“These bacteria wouldn’t have 
had a chance at me,” she said 
firmly, “without Some mighty 
funny coincidences. I got wet be- 
cause I dropped my last carfare 
money, and it rolled like mad, 
and when it came to a crack. I’ll 
swear it just swiveled and eased 
itself in. And I wouldn’t have 
dropped it if my finger hadn’t 
been hurt from when the win- 
dow-cord broke and the window 
came down on my hand. And 1 
wouldn’t have gotten so wet if I’d 
had my slicker — but you re- 
member how that went all funny 
when that bottle of cleaner on 
the shelf came uncorked and 
spilled over it.” 

Carl sighed. “You wouldn’t 
have gotten wet at all if you 
hadn’t tried to be noble and get 
back into harness before you were 
ready. Now, take this, and you’ll 
sleep ten hours and wake up feel- 
ing fine.” 

But the last thing she said as 
she drowsed off was, “Shouldn’ve 
given’m chance. They know when 
you can’t fight’m, ’n they pile on 
you.” 

He pulled the sofa to the bed- 
room door, so he could hear the 
least murmur, made himself a 
bed and turned in. He knew he 
was exhausted, and was deter-

mined to avoid being a soft target 
for either germs or Gremlins by 
getting overfatigued ...» 

He woke in the dead of night, 
with an extra-sensory perception 
of something^ wrong. He rolled 
to his elbow. The air was abnor- 
mally chilly, even for a low-cost 
apartment in December. 

Clare stirred, and he called 
softly, “You all right?” 

She mumbled feverishly, “No. 
I’m coooold.” 

TTIS hand found the floor-lamp 
without actually knocking it 
over. Naturally, the switch was 
in the one position where he had 
to flounder to reach it, and when 
it did click, nothing happened. 

Oh, fine, he thought. Electrici- 
ty’s off. Furnace controls dead! 

He strode over to the bed. The 
electric blanket, of course, was a 
mere flimsy fabric. He patted 
Clare’s hunched shoulder. “I’ll 
get another blanket. Where’s the 
flash?” 

“On the table,” she wheezed, 
and groped on the far side of the 
bed. There was a muffled bump, 
and she lamented weakly, “I had 
it and it just knocked against 
something and flipped out of my 
fingers.” 

“Don’t look for it,” he said. 
“Keep wrapped up. I can find 
my way in the dark.” No use 
wasting precious minutes, he 
thought, blundering around look- 



ing for the flash, while it, neatly 
ensconced in some improbable 
nook, gloated just out of his 
reach. He started around the foot 
of the bed toward the bathroom 
door . 

Something lashed out of the 
dark and swathed itself around 
his ankles. He stumbled disas- 
trously, his outstretched hand 
■plunging through air where wall 
should have been. His temple and 
cheek-bone jarred dazingly 
against a door frame. He saved 
himself from falling, but felt as 
if he had been battle-axed. 

Clare’s voice came hoarse and 
scared: “What happened? Are 
you hurt?” 

He kept his tone cheerful, if 
shaky: “Just tripped over the 
bedspread turned back on the 
floor here. I’ll throw it over you 
till I get the blanket.” 

Easier said than done. The 
topologists’ puzzle of the inner 
tube that can’t be turned inside- 
out through a hole in the side, 
though infinitely elastic, seemed 
elementary compared with flat- 
tening that eight-by-six rectangle 
of fluffy chenille. In the end, he 
gavQk up trying to do a perfect 
job, and bundled it over the shiv- 
ering girl any old way, so he 
could be free to get that blanket. 

The bathroom was utterly 
black; he could see only the dial 
of his wristwatch moving. With 
a sudden giddy feeling that the 



INANIMATE OBJECTION 



95 



solid fixtures had shifted, he 
picked his way from sink to tub 
and along to the linen-closet over 
the tub’s end. His exploring fin- 
gers felt painted wood and brass 
knob, cold and hostile. He open- 
ed the door. Folded sheets and 
shaggy towels seemed somehow 
a little friendlier. Sanity began 
to steal back as he carefully dis- 
engaged a blanket, giving it no 
opportunity to ernulate the un- 
ruliness of the bedspread. As it 
came into his arms, a compact, 
well-folded mass, he let out a 
breath he had not known he was 
holding . 

Something hit the bottom of 
the bathtub with an ear-stunning 
smash — a big bottle of some 
kind that had bided its time up 
there. 

Oh, well — that particular mess 
could wait till morning, safely 
localized inside the tub. He edged 
back toward the door, calling, 
“Okay, honey, just a bottle. Be 
right with you.” And he felt 
something hard under his foot, 
and then a sharp sting. 

His rational brain began par- 
roting, . The first impression 
is "bf contact, carried by fast. 
Group A fibers, followed by one 
of pain, carried by slow. Group C 
fibers. Pain is of two types: first 
pain, bright, stinging, well local- 
ized . 

But a deeper level of his mind 
cut in with, “How did that hunk 



of glass know exactly where I 
was going to put my foot?” 

♦ 

TTE got the blanket around 
Clare, angrily unconcerned 
that he was soaking the good car- 
pet with gore. Nothing mattered 
except beating off this peril to 
Clare, whose teeth were now chat- 
tering in the darkness. Now . 
hot water bottles . 

Eureka! The gas stove would 
heat the place, and give a little 
light too . why hadn’t he 
thought of that at first? Why, for 
that matter, hadn’t he thought of 
using the blankets off his couch- 
bed? They surely did exploit 
your stupidity! 

The hot water bottles were in 
the kitchen. He began to explore 
his way through the living room. 

The darkness was clammy. 
Windows were dim presences, 
hardly revealing their own posi- 
tions. A radiator, when he touch- 
ed it, was cold as drowned bones. 
For an endless moment he was 
groping through a subterranean 
passage, the weight of ancient 
rocks pressing down in a sentient 
and malignant desire to blot out 
his tiny flicker of life. This was a 
Thing with which one could have 
no compromise, because its very 
being was the sucking down of 
human aspiration and dream. Its 
only communication was hate 
and recognition that he was a 
special focus of danger, because 



96 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



he knew It for what It was and 
might rally resistance to It. It 
was attacking him through 
Clare; he stood alone between 
her and faceless Chaos. The 
bright, somewhat shoddy little 
apartment had melted like a 
fragile surface to show an abyss 
of death. 

What would that Presence be 
like if It once organized and 
gained the upper hand? 

He must not pause, or It would 
gain the upper hand . 

His touch found the stove 
where it should be. It had no pi- 
lot burner, and he had to locate 
the match holder. With grim de- 
liberation he struck a match. The 
instant, blinding flare was no 
friendly light. He angled it till it 
burned steadily, then turned on 
the gas. The gust of air that al- 
ways precedes the flow from a 
long-disused burner blew out the 
match. With the same measured 
restraint, he got another. But ten- 
sion and vexation made him 
strike it a little too petulantly. 
As the head plumed into flame, * 
it snapped off and vaulted into a 
far comer. 

For a terrifying instant, he 
thought it had gone into the 
trash basket full of waxed wrap- 
pings and other tinder ... he dove 
after it, and struck his bruised 
cheek sickeningly against a ta- 
ble-corner . the match-head 
died impotently. 

INANIMATE OBJECTION 



He found himself exulting 
aloud: “Failed, you little bas- 
tard!” 

On the third try, he got the 
burner lit, and its eldritch, blue, 
glare made it easier to light the 
others and get on a kettleful of 
water. He looked at the flame 
and admitted he was afraid to 
bundle Clare out here where it 
would soon be warm. If he didn’t 
break his neck, or hers, he would 
probably pitch the two of them 
into the stove. 

While the water was heating, 
he impulsively went to inspect 
the fire escape. The window 
showed nothing but reflections of 
the burners and his own shadowy 
image. He raised the sash, and 
looked out . 

No wonder the power was off! 
The street lamps still shone, far 
below; but they revealed sleet 
falling like molten drops in In- 
ferno; the trees were deep-sea 
corals and the windowpane was 
opaque as a sheet of paraffin. 

Q ueer nausea and faintness 
swamped him . He gripped 
the sill, and his fingers slipped on 
the sheath of ice. For a moment 
he thought he had lost balance 
and was toppling in the grip of 
gravity. Their master-force, over 
the low sill . Even as he recov- 
ered, he could imagine his own 
nightmare howl as he plunged 
past scared neighbors’ windows 

97 



to silence on the icy concrete. 

He grunted, stepped back, 
closed the window. He still felt 
giddy . 

Then he saw the dark smears 
on the floor. It took an exploring 
finger to explain them. He grunt- 
ed again, a sour sound. Who 
wouldn’t feel giddy if they’d been 
bleeding like a stuck pig! It took 
twice as long as it should have 
to put on a pressure bandage 
with a napkin. 

The water was too hot, now. 
He hung the bottles on a hook 
over the sink while he poured 
the scalding fluid into them. As 
he balanced the clum^ kettle, he 
slipped just a little on a smear of 
blood and swung the spout where 
his wrist might have been. But 
that was a waning threat, he real- 
ized — a mere parting shot by a 
repulsed enemy. The knives, 
glassware, electrical gadgets, 
bulks of furniture, all glinted in 
the blue light, demons and imps 
ready to frustrate and harass; 
but the deeper Powec^ had with- 
drawn — temporarily. 

He got the bottles snuggled be- 
side Clare, who murmured grati- 
fication. 

At that juncture, the lights 
went on . 

N ext morning, the paper 
said : eighteen die in freak 
STORM. There were accounts of 
linemen slipping to death, high- 



way crashes, frozen tramps, frac- 
tured skulls. 

Just a skirmish, thought Carl. 
Imagine that situation spread 
over the whole country — millions 
of situations like mine last night, 
year after year . 

Driving back to the Institute, 
he tried to keep his mind on the 
streets, so that last night could 
fall into perspective. Soon it be- 
gan to . soon he was smiling a 
little. But, said his semi-con- 
scious, one thing was sure; 
Whatevef the final verdict on the 
Major’s theory — even if he’s 
wrong — he’s wrong with a damn 
good case! 

Carl flung himself into his 
duties till Matt Loftus came 
around, about mid-afternoon, 
flourishing a crisp, folded docu- 
ment. “This is it, son!’’ said 
Matt. “We lose the Major, and 
the Major regains his right to life, 
liberty and the rebuttal of the 
inanimate. Want to join the Lib- 
eration Committee?’’ 

The Major listened to Matt’s 
announcement with his usual 
courtesy, but with such reserve 
that that normally self-assured 
medico ended rather lamely; 
“Maybe we should have told you 
this was coming along, sir. But 
I figured it as a sort of Christmas 
surprise. Anyway, we just need 
your signature . .’’ 

The Major scanned the paper 
and then laid it on his work- 



98 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



bench, smiling a little sadly. He 
said, “I appreciate your efforts. 
Doctor, and even more I appre- 
ciate your motives. But you don’t 
quite understand.” 

“I — what? What don’t I un- 
derstand?” 

The Major seated himself and 
caressed his mustache for a long 
moment. Then: “Outside I’d be 
a target for a concerted attack. 
They know I’m the greatest men- 
ace to Them on Earth, and 
They’d even risk unmasking 
Themselves — knowing most f>eo- 
ple would simply gawk at the 
most fantastic series of accidents 
and never draw an inference. I 
wouldn’t last a month. Here, I’m 
safe, with everything under con- 
trol.” 

Matt’s face was a study: “But 
. what about alerting other 
people? Don’t you have a duty 
to preach your theory and so 
on?” 

Carl glanced sharply at his 
friend. That was humoring a pa- 
tient! 

“Why, Doctor,” said the Ma- 
jor. “I have the best possible au- 
dience right here, funny as it 
sounds. You of the staff are the 
people best equipped to appre- 
ciate my theory — scientists, but 
not convention-bound theorists. 



You’re not only medical men, 
used to dealing with things as 
they are: you’re psychiatrists, 
whose job is distinguishing be- 
tween the rational and the irra- 
tional. You can analyze vital 
phenomena better than an engi- 
neer such as myself. And you’re 
the people most likely to be lis- 
tened to in turn, and best able to 
defend yourselves from the in- 
evitable attacks by the enemy.” 

TTIS mild but steady gray eyes 
considered the young men, 
and the corners of his mustache 
quirked: “What better converts 
could I have than you two?” 

Carl turned and stared at Matt, 
eyes questioning. 

Matt set his jaw: “Yes, I’m 
going to — to follow it up. To see 
where it goes. And I wouldn’t 
say so till I was sure of at least 
one competent associate . you 
are with me, aren’t you?” 

“Yes,” said Carl, with sudden 
complete conviction. 

The Major leaned back tri- 
umphantly. “You see! Of course, 
this place does put a certain ' 
stigma on my ideas. But with 
the safety factor, and now with 
grade-A channels, why should I 
leave? Do you think I’m crazy?”

detailing and hypnoanalysis — in- 
stead of the usual monthly visit. 
Naturally, the commanding gen- 
eral of the heavily fortified 
research post to which we were 
attached could not ask what we 
were doing, under penalty of 
court-martial, but he had to be 
given further instructions to shut 
off his imagination like a faucet 
every time he heard an explosion. 
Some idiot in Washington was 
actually going to list Project 
Hush in the military budget by 
name! It took fast action, I can 
tell you, to have it entered under 
Miscellaneous “X” Research. 

Well, we’d covered the unfor- 
givable blunder, though not easi- 
ly, and now we could get down to 
the real business of the project. 
You know, of course, about the 
A-bomb, H-bomb and C-bomb 
because information that they ex- 
isted had been declassified. You 
don’t know about the other 
weapons being devised — and nei- 
ther did we, reasonably enough, 
since they weren’t our business — 
but we had been given properly 
guarded notification that they 
were in the works. Project Hush 
was set up to counter the new 
weapons. 

Our goal was not just to reach 



the Moon. We had done that on 
24 June 1967 with an unmanned 
ship that carried instruments to 
report back data on soil, tempera- 
ture, cosmic rays and so on. 
Unfortunately, it was put out of 
commission by a rock slide. 

An unmanned rocket would be 
useless against the new weapons. 
We had to get to the Moon be- 
fore any other country did and 
set up a permanent station — an 
armed one — and do it without 
anybody else knowing about it. 

I guess you see now why we 
on (damn the name!) Project 
Hush were so concerned about 
security. But we felt pretty sure, 
before we took off, that we had 
plugged every possible leak. 

We had, all right. Nobody even 
knew we had raised ship. 

TWTE landed at the northern tip 
” of Mare Nubium, just off 
Regiomontanus, and, after plant- 
ing a flag with appropriate 
throat-catching ceremony, had 
swung into the realities of the 
tasks we had practiced on so 
many dry runs back on Earth. 

Major Monroe Gridley prepar- 
ed the big rocket, with its tiny 
cubicle of living space, for the 
return journey to Earth which 
he alone would make. 

Lieutenant - colonel Thomas 
Hawthorne painstakingly exam- 
ined our provisions and portable 
quarters for any damage that 



PROJECT HUSH 



101 



might have been incurred in land- 
ing. 

And I, Colonel Benjamin Rice, 
first commanding officer of Army 
Base No. 1 on the Moon, dragged 
crate after enormous crate out of 
the ship on my aching academic 
back, and piled them in the spot 
two hundred feet away where the 
plastic dome would be built. 

We all finished at just about 
the same time, as per schedule, 
and went into Phase Two, 

Monroe and I started work on 
building the dome. It was a 
simple pre-fab affair, but big 
enough to require an awful lot 
of assembling. Then, after it was 
built, we faced the real problem 
— getting all the complex internal 
machinery in place and in oper- 
ating order. 

Meanwhile, Tom Hawthorne 
took his plump self off in the 
single-seater rocket which, up to 
then, had doubled as a lifeboat. 

The schedule called for him 
to make a rough three-hour 
scouting survey in an ever -wid- 
ening spiral from our dome. 
This had been regarded as a 
probable waste of time, rocket 
fuel and manpower — but a nec- 
essary precaution. He was sup- 
posed to watch for such things 
as bug-eyed monsters out for a 
stroll on the Lunar landscape. 
Basically, however, Tom’s survey 
was intended to supply extra 
geological and astronomical meat 



for the report which Monroe was 
to carry back to Army HQ on 
Earth. 

Tom was back in forty minutes. 
His round face, inside its trans- 
parent bubble helmet, was fish- 
belly white. And so were ours, 
once he told us what he’d seen. 

He had seen another dome. 

“The other side of Mare Nub- 
ium — in the Riphaen Moun- 
tains,’’ he babbled excitedly. “It’s 
a little bigger than ours, and it’s 
a little flatter on top. And it’s not 
translucent, either, with splotches 
of different colors here and there 
— it’s a dull, dark, heavy gray. 
But that’s all there is to see.’’ 

“No markings on the dome?’’ 
I asked worriedly. “No signs of 
anyone — or anything — around 
it?” 

“Neither, Colonel.” I noticed 
he was calling me by my rank for 
the first time since the trip start- 
ed, which meant he was saying 
in effect, “Man, have you got a 
decision to make!” 

“Hey, Tom,” Monroe put in. 
“Couldn’t be just a regularly 
shaped bump in the ground, 
could it?” 

“I’m a geologist, Monroe. I 
can distinguish artificial from 
natural topography. Besides — ” 
he looked up — “I just remember- 
ed something I left out. There’s a 
brand-new tiny crater near the 
dome — the kind usually left by 
a rocket exhaust.” 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Rocket exhaust?” I seized on 
that. “Rockets, eh?” 

^T'OM grinned a little sympa- 
thetically. “Spaceship ex- 
haust, I should have said. You 
can’t tell from the crater what 
kind of propulsive device these 
characters are using. It’s not the 
same kind of crater our rear- 
jets leave,' if that helps any.” 

Of course it didn’t. So we went 
into our ship and had a council 
of war. And I do mean war. 
Both Tom and Monroe were call- 
ing me Colonel in every other 
sentence. I used their first names 
every chance I got. 

Still, no one but me could 
reach a decision. About what to 
do, I mean. 

“Look,” I said at last, “here 
are the possibilities. They know 
we are here — either from watch- 
ing us land a couple of hours ago 
or from observing Tom’s scout- 
ship — or they do not know we are 
here. They are either humans 
from Earth — in which case they 
are in all probability enemy na- 
tionals — or they are alien crea- 
tures from another planet — in 
which case they may be friends, 
enemies or what-have-you. I 
think common sense and stand- 
ard military procedure demand 
that we consider them hostile 
until we have evidence to the 
contrary. Meanwhile, we proceed 
with extreme caution, so as not 

PROJECT HUSH 



to precipitate an interplanetary 
war with potentially friendly 
Martians, or whatever they are. 

“All right. It’s vitally impor- 
tant that Army Headquarters be 
informed of this immediately. 
But since Moon-to-Earth radio 
is still on the drawing boards, 
the only way we can get through 
is to send Monroe back with the 
ship. If we do, we run the risk 
of having our garrison force, 
Tom and me, captured while he’s 
making the return trip. In that 
case, their side winds up in pos- 
session of important information 
concerning our personnel and 
equipment, while our side has 
only the bare knowledge that 
somebody or something else has 
a base on the Moon. So our pri- 
mary need is more information. 

“Therefore, I suggest that I sit 
in the dome on one end of a tele- 
phone hookup with Tom, who 
will sit in the ship, his hand over 
the firing*button, ready to blast 
off for Earth the moment he gets 
the order from me. Monroe will 
take the single-seater down to 
the Riphaen Mountains, landing 
as close to the other dome as he 
thinks safe. He will then proceed 
the rest of the way on foot, doing 
the best scouting job he can in a 
spacesuit. 

“He will not use his radio, ex- 
cept for agreed-upon nonsense 
syllables to designate landing the 
single-seater, coming upon the 

103 



dome by foot, and warning me to 
tell Tom to take off. If he’s cap- 
tured, remembering that the first 
purpose of a scout is acquiring 
and transmitting knowledge of 
the enemy, he will snap his suit 
radio on full volume and pass on 
as much data as time and the 
enemy’s reflexes permit. How 
does that sound to you?” 

They both nodded. As far as 
they were concerned, the com- 
mand decision had been made. 
But I was sitting under two 
inches of sweat. 

“One question,” Tom said. 
“Why did you pick Monroe for 
the scout?” 

“I was afraid you’d ask that,” 
I told him. “We’re three extreme- 
ly unathletic Ph. D.s who have 
been in the Army since we finish- 
ed our schooling. There isn’t 
too much choice. But I remem- 
bered that Monroe is half Indian 
— Arapahoe, isn’t it, Monroe? — 
and I’m hoping blood 'will tell.” 

“Only trouble. Colonel,” Mon- 
roe said slowly as he rose, “is 
that I’m one-fourth Indian and 
even that . Didn’t I ever tell 
you that my great-grandfather 
was the only Arapahoe scout who 
was with Custer at the Little Big 
Horn? He’d been positive Sitting 
Bull was miles away. However, 
I’ll do my best. And if I hero- 
ically don’t come back, would 
you please persuade the Security 
Officer of our section to clear my 



name for use in the history 
books? Under the circumstances, 
I think it’s the least he could 
do.” 

I promised to do my best, of 
course. 

A FTER he took off, I sat in the 
dome over the telephone 
connection to Tom and hated 
myself for picking Monroe to 
do the job. But I’d have hated 
myself just as much for picking 
Tom. And if anything happened 
and I had to tell Tom to blast 
off, I’d probably be sitting here 
in the dome all by myself after 
that, waiting . 

“Broz neggle!" came over the 
radio in Monroe’s resonant voice. 
He had landed the single-seater. 

I didn’t dare use the telephone 
to chat with Tom in the ship, 
for fear I might miss an impor- 
tant word or phrase from our 
scout. So I sat and sat and 
strained my ears. After a while, 
I heard “Mishgashu!” which told 
me that Monroe was in the 
neighborhood of the other dome 
and was creeping toward it under 
cover of whatever boulders were 
around. 

And then, abruptly, I heard 
Monroe yell my name and there 
was a terrific clattering in my 
headphones. Radio interference! 
He’d been caught, and whoever 
had caught him had simultan- 
eously jammed his suit trans-

mitter with a larger transmitter 
from the alien dome. 

Then there was silence. 

After a while, I told Tom what 
had happened. He just said, 
“Poor Monroe.” I had a good 
idea of what his expression was 
like. 

“Look, Tom,” I said, “if you 
take off now, you still won’t have 
anything important to tell. After 
capturing Monroe, whatever’s in 
that other dome will come look- 
ing for us, I think. I’ll let them 
get close enough for us to learn 
something of their appearance — 
at least if they’re human or non- 
human. Any bit of information 
about them is important. I’ll 
shout it up to you and you’ll 
still be able to take off in plenty 
of time. All right?” 

“You’re the boss. Colonel,” he 
said in a mournful voice. “Lots 
of luck.” 

And then there was nothing to 
do but wait. There was no oxy- 
gen system in the dome yet, so 
I 'had to squeeze up a sandwich 
from the food compartment in 
my suit. I sat there, thinking 
about the expedition. Nine years, 
and all that careful secrecy, all 
that expenditure of money and 
mind-cracking research — and it 
had come to this. Waiting to be 
wiped out, in a blast from some 
unimaginable weapon. I under- 
stood Monroe’s last request. We 
often felt we were so secret that 



our immediate superiors didn’t 
even w;^nt us to know what we 
we were working on. Scientists 
are people — they wish for recog- 
nition, too. I was hoping the 
whole expedition would be writ- 
ten up in the history books, but 
it looked unpromising. 

r^WO hours later, the scout 
ship landed near the dome. 
The lock opened and, from where 
I stood in the open door of our 
dome, I saw Monroe come out 
and walk toward me. 

I alerted Tom and told him to 
listen carefully. “It may be a 
trick — he might be drugged . .” 
He didn’t act drugged, though 
— not exactly. He pushed his 
way past me and sat down on a 
box to one side of the dome. He 
put his booted feet up on another, 
smaller box. 

“How are you, Ben?” he asked. 
“How’s every little thing?” 

I grunted. “Well?" I know my 
voice skittered a bit. 

He pretended puzzlement." Well 
what? Oh, I see what you mean. 
The other dome — you want to 
know who’s in it. You have a 
right to be curious, Ben. Cer- 
tainly. The leader of a top-secret 
expedition like this — Project 
Hush they call us, huh, Ben — 
finds another dome on the Moon. 
He thinks he’s been the first to 
land on it, so naturally he wants 
to—” 



106 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Major Monroe Gridley!” I 
rapped out. “You will come to 
attention and deliver your re- 
port. Now!” Honestly, I felt my 
neck swelling up inside my hel- 
met. 

Monroe just leaned back 
against the side of the dome. 
“That’s the Army way of doing 
things,” he commented admiring- 
ly. “Like the recruits say, there’s 
a right way, a wrong way and 
an Army way. Only there are 
other ways, too.” He chuckled. 
“Lots of other ways.” 

“He’s off,” I heard Tom whis- 
per over the telephone. “Ben, 
Monroe has gone and blown his 
stack.” 

“They aren’t extraterrestrials 
in the other dome, Ben,” Monroe 
volunteered in a sudden burst of 
sanity. “No, they’re human, all 
right, and from Earth. Guess 
where.” 

“I’ll kill you,” I warned him. 
“I swear I’ll kill you, Monroe. 
Where are they from — Russia, 
China, Argentina?” 

He grimaced. “What’s so secret 
about those places? Go on! — 
guess again.” 

I stared at him long and hard. 
“The only place else — ” 

“Sure,” he said. “You got it. 
Colonel. The other dome is own- 
ed and operated by the Navy. 
The goddam United States 
Navy!”

5 Star Shelf 



FAHRENHEIT 451 by Ray 
Bradbury. Ballantine Books, Inc., 
New York, 1953. 199 pages, $2.50 
cloth, 35f paper 

1 1 ■’HIS is the best thing Ray 
Bradbury has ever done. Even 
more, it is among the great works 
of the imagination written in 
English in the last decade or 
more. It is so far in advance of 
what its author has previously 
done, one can hardly belive it 



was written by the author of The 
Martian Chronicles. 

GALAXY readers will remem- 
ber it from the February 1951 
issue as “The Fireman.” They 
will, however, hardly be able to 
recognize this as an outgrowth of 
that excellent tale. 

“The Fireman” was an angry 
fantasy of a mad world; “Fahren- 
heit 451” (which, according to the 
title page, is the temperature re- 
quired to ignite book paper) is 



108 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION. 




an almost Biblical challenge to 
the human race to stop and con- 
sider while there still is time be- 
fore suicide. 

The key idea in both tales is 
that firemen, put out of work by 
the invention of corripletely fire- 
proof buildings, are given the task 
of setting fire, with tanks full of 
kerosene, to the homes of people 
who persist in i>ossessing banned 
books. Practically all books are 
banned in this society. 

However, though the premise is 
the same, the development in the 
new version is not as furiously 
angry as it was in the original. 
Three years of introspection have 
cooled off the rage with pity and 
understanding. 

Ideas and philosophies are set 
down with poetic care, rather 
chan in the fiery fashion of the 
original. Each character is an un- 
forgettable human being — per- 
haps the one major similarity 
between the two versions. 

If you begin to balk at some 
of the more fantastic aspects of 
the story, read the very last page 
of the book, the second page of 
Ballantine’s writeup on Brad- 
bury. There you will find how 
close to reality some of the au- 
thor’s horrible dreams of the fu- 
ture are right now — today. 

The book is fattened out with 
two new short stories, neither of 
which need detain you long. You 
must buy the book for its title 



story, almost novel-length as it is. 
This is one piece of science fic- 
tion that you will never forget, 
even though you may want to. 

PjR/ZE science fiction. 

Edited by Donald A. Wollheim. 
The McBride Co., New York, 
1953. 230 pages, $3.00 

A LTHOUGH this is a pretty 
slim book for the price — 12 
stories at 2Sf per — the quality is 
pleasantly high, in general. Theo- 
retically the first of an annual 
series to compete with the Bleiler- 
Dikty selections, this collection is 
a good one even if it never has 
a sequel. 

Of the 12 stories, nine are B- 
plus or better — and many may 
disagree with my feeling that 
Miller’s “The Big Hunger,” Cop- 
pel’s “The Peacemaker” and 
Brackett’s “The Last Days of 
Shandakor” are too fruity in their 
concept and style for modern 
science fiction. 

The other stories are tops; 
Arthur C. Clarke’s “All the 
Time in the World,” Derleth’s 
Mcllvaine’s Star” (previously an- 
thologized), Robert Locke’s “De- 
motion,” Pearson and Corwin’s 
“The Mask of Demeter,” Beau- 
mont’s “The Beautiful Woman,” 
Kornbluth’s superb “The Altar at 
Midnight,” Dickson’s “Listen,” 
Mark Clifton’s “Star Bright,”

ATT A by Francis Rufus Bel- 
lamy. A. A. Wyn, Inc., New York, 
1953. 216 pages, $3.00 

A TT A, the tale of the life of 
a man reduced to ant-size 
and living among ants, is a slight 
but vivid and occasionally mov- 
ing story of adventure, somewhat 
reminiscent of a Robinson Crusoe 
on a miniature scale. 

More important, it is an im- 
pressive imaginative re-creation 
of what Earth must seem like to 
a person no larger than an ant, 
and an even more striking picture 
of what an ant civilization might 
be like, if there was one. 

Mr. Bellamy, once Executive 
Editor of the New Yorker, and of 
other magizines now dead, posits 
that ants are intelligent, not en- 
tirely creatures of instinct. He 
draws a detailed picture of their 
regimented, doctrinaire and bu- 
reaucratic society which you will 
not soon forget. 

However, the parts of the book 
I liked best are those describing 
the first adventures of’Brokell, 
the man made small, and his re- 
lations to his new world where 
grasses are trees and a tinfoil 
chocolate bar wrapping becornes 



impenetrable armor for his pro- 
tection. 

I also thoroughly enjoyed the 
description of his relations with 
Atta, the solitary ant whom he 
saves from death and who be- 
friends him and makes it possible 
for him to live in his incredible 
new environment. 

This is old-fashioned science 
fiction, in a sense, but even so it 
is vividly real and often very 
moving. 

THE STARS: A NEW WAY 
TO SEE THEM by A. H. Rey. 
Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston, 
1952. 144 pages, $4.50 

k LTHOUGH astronomy, con- 
sidered as the study of the 
constellations, is one of the oldest 
sciences in the world, it was not 
until last year that its study by 
amateurs was made even pass- 
ably easy and pleasant. It was 
then that Mr. Rey, Geririan-born 
but resident in the United States 
since 1940, published this fine 
book. 

Instead of picturing the 
constellations with the vague 
classical-allegorical shapes of tra- 
dition or the meaningless geo- 
metrical lines of more up-to-date 
texts, Rey has developed a tech- 
nique of using straightforward 
lines connecting the stars in each 
constellation so that they actually 
look like a skeleton presentation 



110 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



of the figures they are supposed 
to represent. 

Gemini, the Twins, for exam- 
ple, look like twin stick-figures, 
with each important star in the 
constellation carefully included in 
the drawing. The same thing ap- 
plies even to such complicated 
star groupings as the Great Bear 
and Hercules with his club. 

Not only does the book clearly 
identify the constellations, in 15 
brilliantly simple star charts, but 
it also presents in 12 more charts 
a complete calendar of when and 
where the constellations are visi- 
ble in the sky at latitude 40 
degrees north, together with a 
one-page timetable to refer you 
to the correct chart for any hour 
of the night on any night of the 
year. 

And, to make the book a com- 
plete guide for amateur star- 
gazers, there is an easy, readable 
introduction to the principles of 
scientific astronomy that explains 
everything from the precession of 
the equinoxes to the difference be- 
tween solar and sidereal day so 
clearly that even an astronomical 
illiterate like myself can under- 
stand it. 

Graciously written, superbly il- 
lustrated by the author, and 
printed in large type and two 
colors, this book should become 
an almost obligatory item in the 
library of anyone interested in 
the nature of the ocean of stars.

BRING THE JUBILEE by

Young, New York, 1953. Cloth, 
$2.50; Ballantine Books, Inc., 
New York, 1953, paper, 35^ 

aspect of science fiction 
that {las been overworked 
and yet remains fascinating is 
the “What If?” type of story. 
What if Napoleon had won at 
Waterloo? What kind of world 
would have existed if Hitler had 
been assassinated in 1939? And so 
on. What if — as Ward Moore 
richly and realistically imagines 
in this first-rate novel, the 
“Southrons” had won the Battle 
of Gettysburg? 

Moore, who is a much better 
novelist than he is science fiction- 
eer, draws a picture of a “United 
States” consisting of 26 states 
north of the Mason-Dixon line. 

The story is told by one Hod- 
grins McCormick Backmacker, 
who was born in 1921 and who 
died in 1877. The thing was that 
he died in the world we — you and 
I — know, having changed the 
course of history by appearing at 
Gettysburg from the future and 
inadvertently keeping the South- 
rons from winning that battle — 
which, as we all know, they “act- 
ually” did not. But if they had — ? 

In the world he had known as

child and man, they had. The 
“United States” was a miserable 
dependency of the Confederacy, 
and most of this book is devoted 
to a palpably, painfully real pic- 
ture of the serflike and ignorant 
life of a semi-enslaved Northern 
population. Rarely have I read a 
story that has such as acute un- 
derstanding of how the forces of 
history are bent by events, not 
men. 

Briefly, the novel tells how 
Backmacker, born with an un- 
usual quota of curiosity and self- 
reliance for a Northerner, tries to 
make something of himself. 

He learns to read, gets mixed 
up in which is called “The Grand 
Army” — a subversive bunch of 
saboteurs and petty gangsters 
who are trying to undermine the 
imperial Confederacy — escapes, 
and is finally asked to join an 
intellectual oasis in Pennsylvania. 

There, by various means, he 
becomes involved with a fantastic 
girl who invents a thoroughly fan- 
tastic time machine and goes back 
in the machine to Gettysburg to 
make his “fatal” error. 

This is an important original 
work, much better than the short- 
er version that appeared some 
time ago in Fantasy and Science 
Fiction. 

KILLER TO COME by Sam 
Merwin, Jr. Abelard Press, New 
York, 1953. 251 pages, $2.75 



W ITH every science fiction 
tale from Sam Merwin’s pen 
that comes off the presses, the 
quality improves. 

The current item, though less 
science fiction than detective 
story, has a sharpness and an au- 
thority in its writing, plotting and 
characterizations that make it 
soar high above his previous 
efforts. Like flny detective story, 
it is meant solely to entertain, not 
to edify: but entertain it does, 
in an expert and colorful fashion. 

The tale deals with the ancient 
fantasy of “possession” in a new 
way. The work of most geniuses, 
past and present, has been di- 
rected by minds from a ruthless 
future which take possession of 
either the unstable geniuses them- 
selves or else of unstable people 
(often women) who are in a posi- 
tion to change the course of the 
geniuses’ work. 

Dr. Julius Conrad, student of 
genius at the Wellington Insti- 
tute for Studies in the Human- 
ities, is killed off as he is about 
to publish a volume actually 
proving this theory. 

Other murders occur, and 
Journalist Henry Sanford and 
Detective Joe Luizetti set about 
trying to solve them. Tljey event- 
ually do so,, but with a very wry 
and uncomfortable payoff. 

This is an easy and fast-mov- 
ing tale.

THE PASSENGER 



By KENNETH HARMON 

The classic route to a man's 
heart is through his stomach 
— and she was just his dish. 

Illustrated by CONNELL 

T he transport swung past 
Centaurus on the last leg 
of her long journey to Sol. 
There was no flash, no roar as 
she swept across the darkness of 
space. As silent as a ghost, as 
quiet as a puff of moonlight she 
moved, riding the gravitaticmal 
fields that spread like tangled, 
invisible spider webs between the 
stars. 

Within the ship there was also 
silence, but the air was stirred by 
a faint, persistent vibration from 
the field generators. This noise- 
less pulse stole into every corner 
of the ship, through long, empty 



passageways lined with closed 
stateroom doors, up spiraling 
stairways to the bridge and navi- 
gational decks, and down into 
vast and echoing holds, filled with 
strange cargo from distant worlds. 

This vibration pulsed through 
Lenore’s stateroom. As she re- 
laxed on her couch, she bathed 
in it, letting it flow through her 
to tingle in her fingertips and 
whisper behind her closed eyelids. 

“Home,” it pulsed, “you’re go- 
ing home.” 

OHE repeated the word to her- 
self, moving her lips softly but 
making no sound. “Home,” she 
breathed, “back home to Earth.” 
Back to the proud old planet that 
was always home, no matter how 
far you wandered under alien 
suns. Back to the shining cities 
clustered along blue seacoasts. 
Back to the golden grainlands of 
the central states and the high, 
blue grandeur of the western 
mountains. And back to the myri-

ad tiny things that she remem- 
bered best, the little, friendly 
things ... a stretch of maple- 
shadowed streets heavy and still 
with the heat of a summer noon; 
a flurry of pigeons in the couif- 
house square; yellow dandelions 
in a green lawn, the whir of a 
lawnmower and the smell of the 
cut grass; ivy on old bricks and 
the rough feel of oak bark under 
her hands; water lilies and water- 
melons and crepe papery dances 
and picnics by the river in the 
summer dusk ; and the library 
steps in the evening, with fireflies 
in the cool grass and the school 
chimes sounding the slow hours 
through the friendly dark. 

She thought to herself, “It’s 
been such a long time since you 
were home. There will be a whole 
new flock of pigeons now.” She 
smiled at the recollection of the 
eager, awkward girl of twenty 
that she had been when she had 
finished school and had entered 
the Government Education Ser- 
vice. “Travel While Helping Oth- 
ers” had been the motto of the 
GES. 

She had traveled, all right, a 
long, long way inside a rusty 
freighter without a single port- 
hole, to a planet out on the rim 
of the Galaxy that was as barren 
and dreary as a cosmic slag heap. 
Five years on the rock pile, five 
years of knocking yourself out 
trying to explain history and 



Shakespeare and geometry to a 
bunch of grubby little miners’ 
kids in a tin schoolhouse at the 
edge of a cluster of tin shacks 
that was supposed to be a town. 
Five years of trudging around 
with your nails worn and dirty 
and your hair chopped short, of 
wearing the latest thing in over- 
alls. Five years of not talking with 
the young miners because they 
got in trouble with the foreman, 
and not talking with the crew- 
men from the ore freighters be- 
cause they got in trouble with the 
first mate, and not talking with 
yourself because you got in trou- 
ble with the psychologist. 

They took care of you in the 
Education Service; they guarded 
your diet and your virtue, your 
body and your mind. Everything 
but your happiness. 

^^HERE was lots to do, of 
course. You could prepare les- 
sons and read papers and cheap 
novels in the miners’ library, or 
nail some more tin on your quar- 
ters to keep out the wind and the 
dust and the little animals. You 
could go walking to the edge of 
town and look at all the pretty 
gray stones and the trees, like 
squashed-down barrel cactus; 
watch the larger sun sink behind 
the horizon with its little com- 
panion star circling around it, 
diving out of sight to the right 
and popping up again on the

left. And Saturday night — yippee! 
— three-year-old movies in the 
tin hangar. And, after five years, 
they come and say, “Here’s Miss 
So-and-So, your relief, and here’s 
your five thousand credits and 
wouldn’t you like to sign up for 
another term?” 

Ha! 

So they give you your ticket 
back to Earth. You’re on the 
transport at last, and who can 
blame you if you act just a little 
crazy and eat like a pig and take 
baths three times a day and lie 
around your stateroom and just 
dream about getting home and 
waking up in your own room in 
the morning and getting a good 
cup of real coffee at the corner 
fountain and kissing some hand- 
some young fellow on the library 
steps when the Moon is full be- 
hind the bell tower? 

“And will the young fellow like 
you?” she asked herself, knowing 
the answer even as she asked the 
question. 

She whirled about in the mid- 
^^dle of the stateroom, her robe 
" swirling around her, and ended 
with a deep curtsy to the full- 
length mirror. 

“Allow me to introduce my- 
self,” she murmured. “Lenore 
Smithson, formerly of the Gov- 
ernment Education Service, just 
back from business out on the 
Rim. What? Why, of course you 
may have this dance. Your name? 



Mr. Fairheart! Of the billionaire 
Fairhearts?” She waltzed with 
herself a moment. Halting before 
the mirror again, she surveyed 
herself critically. 

“Well,” she said aloud, “the five 
years didn’t completely ruin you, 
after all. Your nose still turns up 
and your cheeks still dimple 
when you smile. You have a nice 
tan and your hair’s grown long 
again. Concentrated food hasn’t 
hurt your figure, either.” She 
turned this way and that before 
the mirror to observe herself. 

Then suddenly she gave a little 
gasp of surprise and fright, for a 
cascade of laughter had flooded 
soundlessly inside her head. 

S HE stood frozen before the 
mirror while the laughter con- 
tinued. Then she slowly swung 
around. It ceased abruptly. She 
looked around the compartment, 
staring accusingly at each article 
of furniture in turn; then quickly 
spun around to look behind her, 
meeting her own startled gaze in 
the mirror. 

Opening the door slowly, she 
ventured to thrust her head out 
into the corridor. It was deserted, 
the long rows of doors all closed 
during the afternoon rest period. 
As she stood there, a steward 
came along the corridor with a 
tray of glasses, nodded to her, 
and passed on out of sight. She 
turned back into the room and 



THE PASSENGER 



115 



stood there, leaning against the 
door, listening. 

Suddenly the laughter came 
again, bursting out as though it 
had been suppressed and could be 
held back no longer. Clear, mer- 
ry, ringing and completely sound- 
less, it poured through her mind. 

“What is it?” she cried aloud. 
“What’s happening?” 

“My dear young lady,” said a 
man’s voice within her head, “al- 
low me to introduce myself. My 
name is Fairheart. Of the billion- 
aire Fairhearts. May I h^e the 
next dance?” 

“This is it,” she thought. “Five 
years on the rock pile would do 
it to anyone. You’ve gone mad.” 
She laughed shakily. “I can’t 
dance with you if I can’t see you.” 
“I really should explain,” the 
voice replied, “and apologize for 
my silly joke. It was frightfully 
rude to laugh at you, but when 
I saw you waltzing and preening 
yourself, I just couldn’t help it. 
I’m a telepath, you see, from 
Dekker’s star, out on the Rim.” 
That would explain, she 
thought, his slightly stilted 
phraseology; English was appar- 
ently not his native tongue — or, 
rather, his native thought. 

“There was a mild mutation 
among the settlers there, and the 
third generation all have this 
ability. I shouldn’t use it, I know, 
but I’ve been so lonely, confined 
here to my room, that I cast 



around to see if there were any- 
one that I could talk to. Then I 
came upon you considering your 
own virtues, and you were so cute 
and funny that I couldn’t resist. 
Then I laughed and you caught 
me.” 

“T’VE heard of telepaths,” she 
■■■said doubtfully, “though I’ve 
never heard of Dekker’s star. 
However, I don’t think you have 
any right to go thinking around 
the ship spying on people.” 

“Sh!” whispered the silent 
voice. “You needn’t shout. I’ll go 
away if you wish and never spy 
on you again, but don’t tell Cap- 
tain Blake, or he’ll have me seal- 
ed in a lead-lined cell or some- 
thing. We’re not supposed to 
telepath around others, but I’ve 
been sitting here with all sorts of 
interesting thoughts just tickling 
the edges of my mind for so long 
that I had to go exploring.” 
“Why not go exploring on your 
own two feet like anyone else? 
Have you so much brains, your 
head’s too heavy to carry?”. 

“Unfortunately,” the vo^ 
mourned, “my trouble is in my 
foot and not in my head. On the 
second night out from Dekker’s 
star, I lost my footing on the 
stairs from the dining hall and 
plunged like a comet to the bot- 
tom. I would probably have been 
killed but for the person of a 
stout steward who, at that mo- 



116 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




THE PASSENGER 



117 



ment, started to ascend the stairs. 
He took the full impact of my 
descent on his chest and saved 
my life, I’m sure. However, I still 
received a broken ankle that has 
given me so much pain that I 
have been forced to remain in my 
cabin. 

“I have had no one to talk to 
except the steward who brings me 
my meals, and, as he is the one 
whom I met on the stairs, he has 
little to say. In the morning he 
frowns at me, at noon he glowers, 
and in the evening he remarks 
hopefully, ‘Foot still pretty bad?’ 
Thus, I’m starved for conversa- 
tion.” 

Lenore smiled at this earnest 
speech. ‘‘I might talk with you 
for a minute or two, but you must 
admit that you have one advan- 
tage over me. You can' see me, 
or so you say, and know what I 
look like, but I can’t see you. It 
isn’t fair.” 

“I can show myself to you,” he 
. said, “but you’ll have to help me 
by closing your eyes and concen- 
trating very hard.” 

OHE closed her eyes and waited 
^ expectantly. There was a mo- 
ment of darkness; then there ap- 
peared in the middle of the dark- 
ness a point of light, a globe, a 
giant balloon of color. Suddenly 
she was looking into the corner 
of a stateroom which appeared 
to hang in space. In the center 



of the area stood a handsome 
young man in a startling black 
and orange lounging robe, hold- 
ing on to the back of a chair. 

She opened her eyes; for an 
instant the vision of the young 
telepath hung in the air over her 
couch like a ghostly double ex- 
posure. Then it faded and the 
room was empty. 

“That’s a terrible effort,” came 
his thought, “particularly when 
I have to balance on one foot at 
the same time. Well, now are we 
even?” 

Abandoning her post by the 
door, she moved to the couch and 
sat down. “I’m really disappoint- 
ed,” she smiled. “I was sure you’d 
have two heads. But I think you 
do have nice eyes and a terrible 
taste in bathrobes.” She took a 
cigarette from her case and lit 
it carefully. Then she remember- 
ed her manners and extended the 
case to the empty air. “Won’t you 
have one?” 

“I certainly would like to. I’m 
all out of them until the steward 
brings my dinner. But I’m afraid 
I’ll have to wait, unless you can 
blow the smoke through the ven- 
tilators to me, or unless . you 
bring me one?” 

Lenore blushed and changed 
the subject. “Tell me, what do 
you do all day in your stateroom? 
Do you read? Do you play the 
flute? Do you telepath sweet 
nothings across the light-years to 



118 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



your girl friend on Dekker’s 
star?” 

“I’m afraid my telepathic pow- 
ers are a bit short-ranged to reach 
Dekker’s star,” he replied. “Be- 
sides, what girl would commune 
with me through the depths of 
space when some other young 
man is calling her from the danc- 
ing pavilion? And my musical 
talents are limited. However, I 
do read. I brought some books 
connected with the research I in- 
tend to do on Earth for my de- 
gree, and I have spent many 
happy hours poring over the 
thrilling pages of Extraterrestrial 
Entomology and Galactic Ara- 
chnida.” 

“I came better prepared than 
you did,” she said. “Perhaps I 
could lend you some of my books. 
I have novels, plays, poetry, and 
one very interesting volume called 
Progressive Education under Rim 
Star Conditions. But,” she low- 
ered her voice to a whisper, “I 
must tell you a secret about that 
last one.” 

“What is it?” 

“I haven’t even opened it.” 

^^HEY laughed together, her 
-*■ merriment bubbling aloud in 
her cabin, his echoing silently in- 
side her mind. 

“I haven’t time to read a 
novel,” his thought came, “and 
drama always bored me, but I 
must confess to a weakness for 



poetry. I love to read it aloud, 
to throw myself into a heroic 
ballad and rush along, spout- 
ing grand phrases as though 
they were my own and feeling 
for a moment as though I were 
really striding the streets of an- 
cient Rome, pushing west on the 
American frontier or venturing 
out into space in the first wild, 
reckless, heroic -days of rocket 
travel. But I soon founder. I get 
swept away by the rhythm, lost 
in the intricacies of cadence and 
rhyme, and, when the pace slows 
down, when the poem becomes 
soft and delicate and the meaning 
is hidden behind a foliage of lit- 
tle gentle words, I lose myself 
entirely.” 

She said softly, “Perhaps I 
could help you interpret some 
verses.” 

Then she waited, clasping her 
hands to keep them from trem- 
bling with the tiny thrill of ex- 
citement she felt. 

“That would be kind of you,” 
he said after a pause. “You could 
read, there, and I could listen, 
here, and feel what you feel as 
you read ... or, if you wished 
. .” Another pause. “Would you 
care to come down?” 

She could not help smiling. 
“You’re too good a mind reader. 
A girl can’t have any secrets any 
more.” 

“Now look here,” he burst out. 
“I wouldn’t have said anything, 



THE PASSENGER 



119 



but I> was so lonely and you’re 
the only friendly person I’ve come 
in contact with and ...” 

“Don’t be silly,” she laughed. 
“Of course I’ll come down and 
read to you. I’d love to. What’s 
your cabin number?” 

“It hasn’t got a number be- 
cause — actually I work on this 
ship so I’m away from the pas- 
sengers’ quarters. But I can direct 
you easily. Just start down the 
hall to your left and . .” 

“My dear sir,” she cried, “just 
wait a minute! I can’t come visit- 
ing in my robe, you know; I’ll 
have to change. But while I dress, 
you must take your spying little 
thoughts away. If I detect you 
peeking in here at the wrong mo- 
ment, I’ll run straight to Captain 
Blake and have him prepare his 
special lead-lined cell for one un- 
happy telepath. So you just run 
along. When I’m ready. I’ll call 
you and you can lead me to your 
lair.” 

He thought only the one word, 
“Hurry,” but in the silence after 
he was gone she fancied she heard 
her heart echoing him, loud in 
the stillness. 

S HE laughed gaily to herself. 

“Now stop acting like a 
schoolgirl before the Junior Prom. 
You’ve got to get busy and wash 
and dress and comb and brush.” 
And then to her reflection in the 
mirror; “Aren’t you a lucky girl? 



You’re still millions and billions 
of miles from Earth and it’s start- 
ing already, and he’s going to do 
research there for some time, and 
maybe at the university in your 
home town if you tell him just 
how nice it is, and he doesn’t 
know any other girls, you’d have 
an inside track. Now you’d better 
get going or you’ll never be ready. 

“For reading poetry, don’t you 
think this dress is just the thing, 
this nice soft blue one that goes 
so well with your tan and shows 
your legs, which are really quite 
pretty, you know. And your 
silver sandals and those silver 
pins . just a touch of perfume 
. That’s right; and now a little 
lipstick. You do have a pretty 
smile. There, that’s right. Now 
stop admiring yourself and let’s 
go.” 

She moved to the bookshelf, 
frowning now, considered, select- 
ed and rejected. Finally she set- 
tled on three slim books bound in 
russet leather, in glossy plastic, 
in faded cloth. She took a little 
purse from the table, put the cig- 
arette case into it. Then, with a 
laugh, she took one cigarette and 
slipped it into a tiny pocket on 
her skirt. 

“I really meant to bring you 
one,” she whispered to the empty 
air, “but wasn’t I mean to tease?” 

In the corridor, she walked 
quickly past the rows of closed 
doors to the tiny refreshment

stand at the foot of the dining 
room stairs. The attendant rose 
from his stool as she approached, 
and came to the counter. 

“I’d like two frosted starlights, 
please,’’ she said, “on a tray.” 

“Two,” said the attendant, and 
nothing more, but his eyebrow 
climbed up his forehead, hung for 
a second, then slowly drooped 
back to normal, as if to say that 
after all these years he no longer 
puzzled about a lovely young girl 
who came around in the middle 
of a Wednesday rest period, 
dressed like Saturday night and 
smelling of perfume, ordering 
two intoxicating drinks — when 
she was obviously traveling alone. 

T ENORE felt a thrill of secret 
pleasure go through her, a 
feeling of possessing a delicious 
secret, a delightful sensation of 
reckless gaiety, of life stirring 
throughout the sleepy ship, of a 
web of sgprets and countersecrets 
hidden from everyone but this 
unconcerned observer. 

She walked back down the cor- 
ridor, balancing the tray. When 
a little splashed over the rim of 
the tall glasses, she took a sip 
from each, tasting the sweet, cold 
liquid in her throat. 

When she came to the head of 
the stairs, she realized that she 
did not even know her telepath’s 
name. Closing her eyes, she said 
very slowly and distinctly inside 



her head, “Mr. Fairheart?” 
Instantly his thought was with 
her, dverpowering, as breathless 
as an embrace. “Where are you?” 
“At the head of the central 
stairs.” 

“Down you go.” 

She went down the stairs, 
through more corridors, down 
more stairs, while he guided her 
steps. Once she paused to sip 
again at each glass when the 
liquid splashed as she was going 
down. The ice tickled her nose 
and made her sneeze. 

“You live a long way down,” 
she said. 

“I’ve got to be near my 
charges,” he answered. “I told 
you I work on the ship; I’m a 
zoologist classifying any of the 
new specimens of extraterrestrial 
life they’re always picking up. 
And I always get stuck with the 
worst quarters on the ship. Why, 
I can’t even call all my suite my 
own. The whole front room is 
filled with some sort of ship’s 
gear that my steward stumbles 
over every meal time.” 

She went on and on down and 
down. “How many flights?” she 
wondered. “Two or twelve or 
twenty?” Now, why couldn’t she 
remember? Only four little sips 
and her mind felt so cloudy. 
Down another corridor, and what 
was that funny smell? These pas- 
sages were poorly ventilated in 
the lower levels; probably that 



THE PASSENGER 



121 



was what made her feel so dizzy. 

“Only one more flight,” he 
whispered. “Only one more.” 
Down and along and then the 
door. She paused, conscious of 
rising excitement, conscious of her 
beating heart. 

Dimly she noticed the sign on 
the door. “You — you mean what- 
ever it is you’re taking care of is 
in there with you?” 

“Don’t be frightened,” his per- 
suasive thought came. “It can’t 
hurt you. It’s locked in a cage.” 
Then she slid the bolt and 
turned the handle. Her head hurt 
for an instant; and she was in- 
side, a blue and silver shadow in 
the dim anteroom, with the tray 
in her hand and the books under 
her arm and her pulse hammer- 
ing. 

She looked around the dim 
anteroom, at the spidery tangle 
of orange and black ropes against 
the left-hand wall; then at the 
doorway in the right-hand wall 
with the warm light streaming 
through. He was standing in the 
second room, one hand on the 
chair for support, the other ex- 
tended toward her. For the first 
time he spoke aloud. 

“Hello, butterfly,” he said. 
“Hello,” she said. She smiled 
and walked forward into the light. 
She reached out for his hand. 



Then she stopped short, her 
hand pressed against an impene- 
trable wall. 

S HE could see him standing 
there, smiling, reaching for 
her hand, but there was an invisi- 
ble barrier between them. Then, 
slowly, his room began to fade, 
the light dimmed, his figure grew 
watery, transparent, vanished. 
She was standing, staring at the 
riveted steel bulkhead of a com- 
partment which was lit only by 
the dim light filtering through the 
thick glass over the transom. 

She stood there frozen, and the 
ice in the glasses tinkled nervous- 
ly. Then the tray slipped from 
her fingers and clattered to the 
floor. Icy liquid splashed the sil- 
ver sandals. In the silent gloom 
she stood immobile, her eyes wide 
in her white face, her fist pressed 
to her mouth, stifling a scream. 

Something touched her gently 
at head and wrist and«ankle — 
all over her body. The web clung, 
delicate as lace, strong as steel. 

Even if she had been able to 
move, she could not have broken 
free as the thing against the wall 
began to clamber down the 
strands on eight furred legs. 

“Hello, butterfly,” he said 
again.

FIRST time ma-

B lessor Johnson proudly 
informed his two colleagues. 
“True, it is a small-scale experi- 
mental model. It will operate 
only on objects weighing less 
than three pounds, five ounces 
and for distances into the past 
and future of twelve minutes or 



less. But it works.” 

The small-scale model looked 
like a small scale — a postage 
scale — except for two dials in the 
part under the platform. 

Professor Johnson held up a 
small metal cube. “Our experi- 
mental object,” he said, “is a 
brass cube weighing one pound, 
two point, three ounces. First, I

shall send it five minutes into the 
future.” 

He leaned forward and set one 
of the dials on the time machine. 
‘‘Look at your watches,” he said. 

They looked at their watches. 
Professor Johnson placed^ the 
cube gently on the machine’s 
platform. It vanished. 

Five minutes later, to the sec- ^ 
ond, it reappeared. 

Professor Johnson picked it 
up. ‘‘Now five minutes into the 
past.” He set the other dial. Hold- 
ing the cube in his hand he look- 
ed at his watch. ‘‘It is six minutes 
before three o’clock. I shall now 
activate the mechanism — by 
placing the cube on the platform 
— at exactly three o’clock. There- 
fore, the cube should, at five 
minutes before three, vanish from 
my hand and appear on the plat- 
form, five minutes before I place 
it there.” 

“How can you place it there, 
then?” asked one of his col- 
leagues. 

“It will, as my hand ap- 



proaches, vanish from the plat- 
form and appear in my hand to 
be placed there. Three o’clock. 
Notice, please.” 

The cube vanished from his 
hand. 

It appeared on the platform of 
the time machine. 

“See? Five minutes before I 
shall place it there, it is there I” 
His other colleague frowned at 
the cube. “But,” he said, “what 
if, now that it has already ap- 
peared five minutes before you 
place it there, you should change 
your mind about doing so and not 
place it there at three o’clock? 
Wouldn’t there be a paradox of 
some sort involved?” 

“An interesting idea,” Profes- 
sor Johnson said. “I had not 
thought of it, and it will be in- 
teresting to try. Very well, I 
shall not . .” 

There was no paradox at all. 
The cube remained. 

But the entire rest of the Uni- 
verse, professors and all, van- 
ished.

ment difficult. 

But in tens of thousands of 
years this part of war hadn’t 
changed. The flyboys were fine 
with their sleek spaceships and 



124

their fancy weapons. When the 
chips are down,. though, it was 
still the foot soldier, the infantry, 
that had to take the ground and 
hold it, foot by bloody foot. Like 
this damned planet of a star he’d 
never heard of until they’d land- 
ed him there. And now it was 
sacred ground because the aliens 
were there too. The aliens, the 
only other intelligent race in the 
Galaxy . cruel, hideous and re- 
pulsive monsters. 

Contact had been made with 
them near the center of the Gal- 
axy, after the slow, difficult col- 
onization .of a dozen thousand 
planets: and it had been war at 
sight; they’d shot without even 
trying to negotiate, or to make 
peace. 

Now, planet by bitter planet, 
it was being fought out. 

He was wet and muddy and 



hungry and cold, and the day 
was raw with a high wind that 
hurt his eyes. But the aliens were 
trying to infiltrate and every 
sentry post was vital. 

He stayed alert, gun ready. 
Fifty thousand light-years from 
home, fighting on a strange world 
and wondering if he’d ever live 
to see home again. 

And then he saw one of them 
crawling toward him. He drew a 
bead and fired. The alien made 
that strange horrible sound they 
all make, then lay still. 

He shuddered at the sound and 
sight of the alien lying there. One 
ought to be able to get used to 
them after a while, but he’d never 
been able to. Such repulsive crea- 
tures they were, with only two 
arms and two legs, ghastly white 
skins and no scales.

1 T wasn’t until we were curv- 
ing in past Pluto that it oc- 
curred to any of us there 
might be difficulties about the 
job. 

“I suppose they’ll come back 
with us all right?” said Tylo 
suddenly, as she and I picked out 
Earth among the pinpoints of 
light ahead. 

“Why, sure,” I said. “Why 
would they want to stay?” 

“I don’t know — I just wonder- 
ed,” said Tylo vaguely. 

It ill becomes me as her broth- 
er to say so, but Tylo has no 
brains. She won’t mind this ad- 
mission if I add, as I intend to, 
that what she lacks in intelligence 



she makes up for in beauty. I 
might not have noticed that my- 
self, but I’ve been told about it 
— often. She also has something 
else she can and does use instead 
of brains. It might be intuition. 
Anyway, it’s the capacity she of- 
ten shows for finding the right 
thing to do, without laying any 
claim to the intelligence the rest 
of us need to work it out. With- 
out it, she would not be a lieut- 
tenant in the Navy. 

For the time being, that was 
all we said on the subject. There 
had been no suggestion of trouble 
about this job. 

little star we were ap- 
proaching had once been 
much brighter. Even so, it was 
stronger than it would be in two 
hundred years, a hundred years, 
even fifty. This was the Sun that 
warmed the world that nurtured 
the seed that grew to life that 
developed intelligence that dis- 
covered the power that conquered 
space. The mighty Federation 
that seeped farther through the 
Galaxy, year by year, was the 
house that Jack built. 

I’d just been promoted to cap- 
tain of the Natal, a transport 
ship. Being captain of a trans- 
port ship is a strange job, full 
of ups and downs. Sometimes 
you’ve only got the Ship itself — 
the node, it’s called — and you 
feel like the lowest thing in the 



MEN LIKE MULES 



127 



Navy, because the node, for all 
its power, is hardly bigger than 
a scout. And scout commanders 
are only lieutenants really, not 
exalted Naval brass like cap- 
tains — like me. Maneuvering 
around slowly in your ungainly 
node, a ludicrous little seven- 
man tub of a ship, the ugliest and 
second-smallest thing in space, 
you feel like an admiral in a row- 
boat. 

But when you’re on a nine or 
ten-unit job, and you’re pulling 
a couple of thousand people or 
hundreds of tons of cargo behind 
you, then you feel you’re some- 
body. It doesn’t matter that your 
equipage is as ugly and clumsy 
as ever, and that you still have a 
crew of only twenty or so to boss 
around. In terms of life and 
equipment, you’ve got as much 
responsibility as anyone in the 
Navy and all the other ships in 
your sector are rerouted to give 
you the widest of wide berths, 
which gives you a feeling of 
power. 

This was my first job in actual 
command of the Natal, and it 
was a big one. It wasn’t difficult, 
at least not on the face of it. 
All I had to do was pick up the 
seven thousand remaining Ter- 
rans and take them to Yuny. 
From the technical and naviga- 
tional point of view, a job like 
that wasn’t beyond any ordinary 
junior lieutenant in the Navy. 



When you consider, however, 
the people I was transporting, 
and from where and why, you 
see why it was a big job. Earth, 
after all, was the birthplace of 
the human race. Though not by 
any means the only place in the 
Galaxy in which human beings 
could live, it was certainly" the 
only place where human beings 
could have evolved. 

This evacuation, this last fare- 
well to Mother Earth, meant far 
more than just the removal of 
seven thousand people from one 
place to another. 

W E reached Earth and jockey- 
ed the fourteen vast units — 
separate ships, really — into an 
orbit around the planet. That 
took time and care, but no parti- 
cular skill. The principle of the 
transport ship is obvious. A pow- 
ered, independent vessel to carry 
five hundred people isn’t a com- 
plete impossibility, but it’s im- 
practicable. Two hundred is 
about the most any single ship 
is ever built to accommodate. 
Five hundred, on the other hand, 
can very easily and comfortably 
be housed in a vast shell of a 
vessel which has no motors, no 
jets, no gyros and which never 
has to stand the stresses and 
strains of gravity. 

These units are assembled in 
space, loaded and unloaded in 
space and, when not in use, are 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



left orbiting around a nearby 
planet until they’re needed again. 
There’s next to no limit to the 
number of units a node can draw. 
At any rate, no one ever wants to 
transport more people or goods 
at any one time than one node 
can handle. 

The only real difference be- 
tween the transport ships and 
locomotives drawing trucks 
across the face of a planet is 
the absence of gravity. Instead 
of applying its*brakes like a 
locomotive when it wants to stop, 
the node has to get around be- 
hind the units in free flight, link 
up again and decelerate from the 
tail spots. Sounds complicated, 
but it’s not. All the node had to 
do is move out of the way, de- 
celerate very slightly, let the 
units in free fall coast on past 
it, edge itself into position and 
brake the whole convoy gradu- 
ally. 

I left the maneuvers over 
Earth to Tylo and Jim Cubert. 
We were all on duty, the seven 
of us, but there was nothing for 
the rest of us to do exbept check 
everything Tylo and Jim did. 

Hard things are said about the 
Navy in the Navy, because we 
always gripe when we have to 
do what we’re told, but it must 
be admitted that we have most 
of our personnel problems taped. 
There’s always the right kind 
of crew for every job. A scout 



crew would be of no use in a 
transport ship, and both comple- 
ments would be utterly unsuit- 
able for duty on a big ship. 

1 1 ■<HE men and women chosen 
for transport-ship duty have 
this in common — ^they’re all re- 
laxed, indolent types — unworried, 
unhurried, yet capable of bursts 
of activity for short periods. 
That’s what is wanted in a trans- 
port ship. Most of the time 
you’re doing nothing, because 
there’s ■ nothing to do. Discipline 
hardly exists. A brother and sis- 
ter wouldn’t be officers together 
in any other Naval ship, but 
things like that are common 
enough in transports. 

“How did we do?’’ Tylo asked 
anxiously. She needn’t have been 
anxious. Once again, she had 
demonstrated her talent for do- 
ing the right thing without, ap- 
parently, thinking. 

“You couldn’t have done much 
better,” I admitted. “That is, 
provided this orbit is right. Wait 
till I check it.” 

Mary Wall checked with me. 
Mary and Tylo were the only 
women on the ship. There should 
have been three, to four men, 
but there are never enough girls 
in the Navy. Plenty come in, 
but most of them soon go out 
again, for one reason or another. 

Mary is a nice girl. But, from 
the point of view of appearance. 



MEN LIKE MULES 



129 



she couldn’t offer competition to 
a lot of girls who couldn’t offer 
competition to Tylo. That was 
unfortunate for me. The other 
four men could at least enjoy 
looking at Tylo — ^there wasn’t 
much in that for me. 

So I was glad when we cast off, 
leaving the fourteen units — each 
with its own lieutenant in charge 
— coasting around above Earth’s 
atmosphere and dropped toward 
Earth. It was a long time since 
I had had any interesting fem- 
inine companionship and I was 
looking forward to meeting the 
Terrans and a pleasant trip back. 

We landed in the Lenny Val- 
ley and put on warm coats be- 
fore we went out. We didn’t need 
them really — the Lenny Valley is 
on the equator and still quite 
warm. But the knowledge that, 
of the once warm and friendly 
Earth, ninety-nine per cent was 
now snow and ice made us doubt- 
ful about even the few temperate 
spots. 

The Terrans came out to meet 
us, hundreds of them, and we 
were astonished to see how light- 
ly clad they were. I don’t mean 
they were dressed like the girls 
on the adventure magazine cov- 
ers, but they wore only light, gay 
clothes, not furs and snowboots 
as I had half expected. They were 
an attractive lot — a very attrac- 
tive lot. What struck me particu- 
larly at first glance was how 



many old men were still hand- 
some and athletic and how many 
middle-aged women had retain- 
ed both beauty and slimness. 

“Hello,” said a tall Terran 
pleasantly. “I’m Wili. This is 
Jan, and Bel — Meni — Reina — 
Tian — Martin. Is that enough for 
you at present?” 

I guessed that Wili had intro- 
duced seven people to us, inclu- 
ding himself, because there were 
seven of us. I introduced our 
party in the ^ame bald way. 
“Captain Tony Wolkin. My sis- 
ter Tylo — Jim Cubert — Mary 
Wall — Noblin — Joe Dee — Ramon 
Barr.” In the meantime. I noticed 
such diverse items as Wili’s over- 
whelming personality, Tian’s 
slow, friendly grin — the apparent 
absence of excitement in the Ter- 
rans, or anything more than mild 
interest — Meni’s neat ankles — 
how quickly my body felt at 
home on Earth — the strange, un- 
expected lights in Jan’s black 
hair — the impish humor in Mar- 
tin’s eyes. 

Wl^ILI was more than just a tall 
^ Terran. He was a leader, 
one of those strange individuals 
people like and follow, even 
though there may be nothing lik- 
able about them, or any real rea- 
son why they should be followed. 
I knew Wili was one of the peo- 
ple I’d always remember and I 
had to make an effort before I 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



could treat him as an equal, as 
the leader of one group to an- 
other. 

“Shall we talk business right 
away,” I asked bluntly, “or 
would you rather we all got ac- 
quainted first?” 

“I’d much rather we became 
better acquainted,” he said ami- 
ably. “Your ship must be rather 
crowded — won’t you come and 
make yourself comfortable in my 
house?” 

We walked slowly across the 
grass. The seven Terrans who had 
been introduced to us — four wo- 
men and three men, all young — 
stayed with us, but the others 
stayed in the background. I was 
glad Wili didn’t talk. I wanted to 
get some more impressions. 

The attractiveness of the Ter- 
rans was even more striking when 
they were close. I began to under- 
stand it a little as I looked at 
them, one after another. 

A restless, passionate, polyglot 
culture has one kind of physical 
beauty. I knew that' kind, the 
wild, virile attractiveness of so 
many Federation planets, where 
everything is new ^ and raw and 
human characteristics are shaken 
up and mixed violently together 
in the pioneer surge — race, intelli- 
gence, strength, passion, impa- 
tience, artistic ability, courage. 

The Terrans, in contrast, were 
placid, patient and cool. Not one 
of them had ever been hurried. 



Instead of talking loudly and rap- 
idly, because there was so little 
time to talk and people were too 
busy to listen for long, they made 
speech a beautiful thing, sweet 
and slow and musical. Instead of 
scuttling about in an eternal race 
against time, they made every 
movement fluid and graceful, 
flowed neatly and artistically into 
the next. Instead of throwing on 
garments that didn’t need atten- 
tion, they dressed with such un- 
hurried taste and care that any 
one of them could have served 
as a model for those few leisured 
people in the Federation worlds 
who really cared for their ap- 
pearance. 

They were artists, every one of 
them. Those who had talent had 
it developed— those who hadn’t 
were given artistic education as a 
substitute for natural taste. 

As we approached the Lenn 
township, we saw that it, too, 
showed the same taste and crafts- 
manship. I won’t try to describe 
it. I know what’s good when I 
see it, but I don’t know why or 
how it’s good. 

We were all warm by the time 
we entered Will’s house. We shed 
our coats and followed the seven 
Terrans into a pleasant room that 
was half veranda, half sunroom. 

T DIDN’T know how much the 
-*■ Terrans had been told. My 
orders were simply to evacuate 



MEN LIKE MULES 



T31 



Earth completely, leaving no sin- 
gle human being there, for rea- 
sons which were stated, but which 
I was not to pass on to the 
Terrans if I could help it. 

Tylo had taken to Wili, I saw. 
Tylo is a simple soul. Perhaps the 
best way to describe her is to 
say she’s a kindly, motherly old 
lady, except that she happens to 
be twenty-two and beautiful. She 
always thinks the best of people, 
no matter how much caution and 
toughness the Navy tries to im- 
pose upoh her, or how many 
wolves she encounters in the 
course of her amorous adven- 
tures. 

Wili, I wasn’t so sure about, 
but he seemed to have taken to 
Tylo too. 

“No,” she was saying, “I’ve 
never been to Earth before. But 
you know that, don’t you? You 
must know everyone who comes 
here these days.” 

“I just wondered,” said Wili, 
“because you’ve taken every- 
thing so much for granted — you 
and your brother. That isn’t 
usual.” 

“What usually isn’t taken for 
granted?” I asked. 

Wili smiled. “The last Naval 
ship was here two years ago. Its 
people thought us very quaint. 
They had cameras and took pic- 
tures of us. They even recorded 
our speech.” 

“The natives are friendly.” 



“Exactly! You seem to under- 
stand.” 

I explained something of Naval 
selection. The last ship was an 
exploration job. Its personnel, I 
knew without Wili’s hint, would 
naturally be glorified tourists, 
fastening on anything that was 
different from the worlds they 
knew. Wili listened with interest 
to my bit of rote. 

A S I talked, Jan joined the 
group, and I wasn’t sorry. 
She was to Wili’s group what 
Tylo was to ours. Tylo, I thought, 
didn’t show up too well beside 
her. But that could be because 
Tylo wore a coverall which was 
neat, but purely utilitarian, while 
Jan wore a green silk dress which 
was sheer poetry. 

“I begin to have more respect 
for your Navy,” said Wili. “I 
didn’t give it credit for selecting 
the right human types for its 
various jobs.” 

I wanted to say something to 
Jan, but didn’t know what. So I 
answered Wili. “Tourists have 
seldom been a good advertise- 
ment for their country, or their 
world. Yet they have the neces- 
sary interest, the energy to find 
things out. And, generally, they 
are decent enough. They didn’t 
bother you, did they?” 

“Not at all,” said Jan. “We 
liked them. Nearly all of them 
paid me the compliment of tak- 



132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ing pin-up pictures of me. So I 
naturally didn’t have any objec- 
tions.” 

Jan had duly come into the 
conversation, but there wasn’t 
much I could do with that. She 
had spoken with irony, a faint 
shade of resentment, an even 
fainter suggestion of humor. Any- 
thing I said would be wrong. I 
reflected on the oddity of tour- 
ists taking holiday snapshots of 
Jan, the attractive native. Hadn’t 
they even sensed her superior in- 
telligence and cultural' back- 
ground? 

Probably they hadn’t. I don’t 
have a tall I.Q., but I had the 
brains and perception to know 
at once that the Terrans were 
more truly cultured than any 
other people in the Federation. 
The crew of the exploration ship, 
however, had no doubt seen that 
the Terrans climbed stairs in- 
stead of using elevators, walked 
instead of using cars, had no 
washing-machines, TV or film 
stars. So, they had rated them 
attractive primitives, quaint and 
backward. 

“Don’t underestimate the ex- 
ploration crew,” I said, feeling an 
obscure urge to defend the Navy. 
“There would be some pretty 
shrewd reports going in — some 
from people you hardly noticed.” 

Wili nodded. “I guessed that. 
We tried to make the rep)orts as 
accurate as possible.” 



A GAIN I had that feeling that 
I was like a child with these 
people. Don’t misunderstand me 
— I’m not making out that the 
Terrans are a super-race, or any- 
thing like that. But they have 
culture and education and under- 
standing which probably no one 
else had time or inclination to ac- 
quire these days. And Wili, Jan 
and probably Martin had intelli- 
gence I couldn’t match. It was 
natural enough. They were prob- 
ably the cleverest of the seven 
thousand Terrans and I was only 
an ordinary Naval captain. 

Wili got me to state my busi- 
ness exactly when he wanted, not 
when I felt the time was right. He 
exchanged a glance with Jan, a 
glance which said clearly enough 
that it was just about what they 
had expected. 

“Twenty or so will go back with 
you,” he said. “I’m not sure how 
many. We haven’t made a survey. 
Say twenty certainly, fifty pos- 
sibly, a hundred at most.” 

“But I’m here to evacuate you 
all,” I said, quelling my uneasi- 
ness. 

“Oh, no,” said Wili pleasantly. 
“The rest of us aren’t going. 
Neither now nor later.” 

“And if you think we’re merely 
being coy,” added Jan indiffer- 
ently, “you can ask everyone in- 
dividually. It won’t make any 
difference. We’re staying here. 
We belong here.”

TT became more and more clear 
that they meant it. I didn’t 
do anything about it then. I 
wanted to think the matter over. 
But later I talked, I argued, I 
even threatened. 

I had read my instructions 
again. They were quite definite 
— Earth to be evacuated com- 
pletely. I read the stated reasons 
too, and related them to my own 
ideas. They made sense. 

Earth was still important. All 
through the Galaxy, on every one 
of the ninety-four Federation 
planets, people had a warm spot 
for the old world. The Yunians, 
say, were’ mildly interested in 
the Collahimans or the Smithson- 
ians or the Carones, but everyone 
was much more than mildly in- 
terested in the Terrans. It was 
a brake on Federation affairs. 

If nothing had been wrong on 
Earth, or if Earth had been dead 
and deserted, people wouldn’t 
have spared a thought for it. But 
now, with the Sun rapidly de- 
clining, with Federation scientists 
seeking explanations and excuses 
for the occurrence of something 
they had said could not possibly 
occur. Earth was always in the 
Federation’s thoughts. It was like 
an exciting game that wasn’t 
quite over. 

Meanwhile, Earth counted too 
much. There seemed to be no 



doubt about that. People didn’t 
really love Earth, they were just 
sentimental about it. It was like 
one of the old tear-jerker death- 
bed scenes, and it could drag on 
for years yet. The whole Federa- 
tion was trying to carry on its 
multifarious activities with one 
eye on Earth. The traders, more 
hard-headed, didn’t like it. The 
governors didn’t like it. The 
Navy didn’t like it. 

That was what I was to avoid 
telling the Terrans, if I could. 
Fortunately, none of the people 
left on Earth had ever been in 
any of the Federation cities. They 
didn’t know how our smart, go- 
ahead Federation citizens sighed 
and went dreamy-eyed and senti- 
mental when someone sang Take 
Me Back to Dear Old Terra. 
They didn’t know why I had 
orders to ring down the curtain 
—■so that the audience could go 
back to work. 

A nd I agreed that the Terrans 
shouldn’t be told this. They 
were proud and placid and im- 
perturbable anyway. They were 
intelligent, cultured mules, but 
still mules. Perhaps this would 
make them even prouder and 
then it would be quite impossible 
to shift them. 

Of course, I could go back and 
report that the Terrans wouldn’t 
come. I could imagine what 
would be said at Naval HQ if I 



134 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



did. “You were sent to evacuate 
them, weren’t you? Why didn’t 
you?” 

Every captain in a Space Navy 
has far more responsibility than 
an admiral in a Sea Navy. The 
admiral has to radio for orders. 
The captain has to act on the 
spot. Months, sometimes years 
may pass before a Federation 
Navy captain can report back for 
further orders and return and 
execute them. Besides, there is 
the colossal item of expense. 
Could I go back to Yuny and ask 
wjjat I was to do now? 

I could not. 

I had been sent to evacuate 
Earth and I couldn’t go back to 
Yuny without the Terrans unless 
I was prepared to say, “I didn’t 
do what I was sent to do, because 
the situation had changed since 
I got my orders. Instead I . .” 

The situation hadn’t changed. 
Earth still had to be evacuated, 
now or later. Anyone could see 
that with half an eye. Why 
couldn’t the Terrans? Why did 
they choose to be mulish? 

I set out to make them see it. 
I argued with Wili, with Jan, 
with Bel, with Martin, with peo- 
ple I sought out myself, just to 
see what the ordinary Terran 
thought. 

Already, nearly all of Earth 
was frozen to death. Only the 
narrow belt that got the greatest 
concentration of the Sun’s feeble 

MEN LIKE MULES 



rays had enough heat and light. 
True, Earth’s inner fires still 
burned. By comparison with 
some of the barren worlds which 
were only now being colonized. 
Earth was still young. Earth, 
however, was dependent on a sun 
which had failed her. Hurricanes 
raged over most of the planet’s 
surface, blizzards hid the dead 
rock from sight. What had once 
been the Land of the Midnight 
Sun now had hardly any light at 
all. 

There were still warm spots on 
the equator. I gathered that the 
Terrans sometimes went to swim 
in tepid pools, in regions where 
the temperature was in the seven- 
ties — for a time. But only the 
Lenny Valley had the small range 
of temperature to which human 
beings are accustomed. A sort of 
Shangri-la, it was a refuge from 
the blizzards outside, the biting 
cold, the tearing winds, the 
floods, even the occasional, capri- 
cious heat. 

T saw in a few days that people 
* could live quite comfortably 
in Lenny Valley with very little 
shelter, without artificial weather 
control, without mechanization. 
They grew crops on the slopes, 
with hydroponics a standby. 
They kept cows and sheep and 
poultry and generally led a sim- 
ple, fairly easy but full life divid- 
ed among agriculture, building, 

135 



reading, music, weaving, drama, 
painting and a hundred other 
things. It was idyllic — but so 
ephemeral. 

Next year, or in ten years, the 
shirts would become heavy tu- 
nics, the light sandals heavy 
boots, the graceful skirts thick, 
heavily lined trousers. The crops 
would die. The cattle would die. 
Even the people would begin to 
die, as life became harder. And 
there would be nowhere on Earth 
to go. When Lenny Valley be- 
came cold, evers^where else would 
be colder. Unless the Federation 
forgot its pique at being turned 
down before and sent another 
transport ship — for the Terrans 
had nothing like a spaceship of 
their own — the Terrans would 
die, a few at first, then all in a 
rush. 

It was so unreasonable, so 
obstinate, so untypical of Wili 
and Jan, that I wondered if they 
were quite sane. I knew why they 
wanted to stay on Earth. It was 
natural — I could understand that 
myself. But not to leave it, when 
they obviously must — were they 
relying on the Federation to keep 
sending ships? If so, the sooner 
they were disillusioned, the bet- 
ter. The Navy isn’t inhumane, 
but it does things like this in its 
own time. 

Sending a ship on a long and 
fantastically expensive journey 
every few years, to see if the Ter- 

136 



rans were ready to leave yet, had 
no place in Naval economics. No 
one was prepared to calculate, 
after being so wrong already, how 
long the Sun would radiate ener- 
gy at roughly its present rate. 
The Navy’s plan, the sensible 
plan, was to evacuate the Terrans 
now, earlier than necessary, in- 
stead of coming back, possibly 
just too late, to rescue them. 

If the situation was as it seem- 
ed to be, I clearly had to take the 
Terrans away by force if neces- 
sary. If they were going to act 
like mules. I’d have to treat them 
as mules. I told Wili that. 

He laughed. “You wouldn’t 
have told me that if you meant to 
do it, Tony,’’ he said — he still 
persisted in being friendly. “And 
I wouldn’t be laughing, if I 
thought you could do it. But 
though you’ve got plenty of pow- 
er in that ugly little ship of 
yours, how are you going to use 
it to get seven thousand of us in 
those shells out in space, when 
we won’t come? How are you go- 
ing to use your force of seven — 
even your force of twenty-one — 
to make us?” 

TTE was right. Evacuating sev- 
en thousand unwilling Ter- 
rans with the force I had was 
like building ships to accommo- 
date five hundred people. It 
wasn’t downright impossible, but 
it was highly impracticable.

“I might,” I said on another 
occasion, to Jan this time, “have 
your determination to stay here 
ruled attempted suicide. In such 
a case, you could be taken into- 
protective custody and removed 
to safer worlds.” 

“How true!” sighed Jan, not 
very interested. Jan never did 
seem very interested in anything. 
“But, if you try to do this in a 
legalistic way, look at all the 
shuttling back and forth there’s 
going to be between here and 
the Federation worlds. Will that 
make you popular?” 

It wouldn’t. I had to abandon 
that idea. And it was the same 
with everything else I thought of. 

Once Jan and I walked a mile 
or so down the valley, and I re- 
frained from mentioning my mis- 
sion. For the moment, I was 
more interested in Jan. I’m not 
very good at making guesses 
about groups like the Terrans or 
nations or races. But I can make 
pretty good guesses about indi- 
viduals. I was beginning to have 
an idea about Jan. She was 
young, beautiful, intelligent — yet 
bored, resentful, almost apathetic. 
Nevertheless, I was sure she was 
made for happiness, not misery. 
She didn’t have the capacity for 
enjoying misery that a real pes- 
simist has. 

“Suppose I tried to kiss you,” 
I wondered aloud, “what’s likely 
to come of it?” 



“You’d probably succeed,” 
said Jan indifferently. Being kiss- 
ed, apparently, was one of the 
many things that didn’t matter 
at all. 

I kissed her. Then I looked at 
her, puzzled. 

“Have I purple teeth?” she 
asked resentfully. “Has my nose 
turned upside down?” 

“I wish I understood you, Jan.” 

“No one ever understands any- 
one.” 

I shook my head. “Not one of 
your more intelligent remarks, 
Jan. You know perfectly well 
what I mean.” 

“Why should I think for you?” 

T tried to take her in my arms 
again, but she fended me off. 

“May I have three guesses?” 
I asked. 

“About what?” 

• “You. Why you’re always 
angry.” 

“I’m not angry,” she retorted 
angrily. 

“People are generally angry,” 
I said thoughtfully, “when they 
think they’ve made a bad mis- 
take.” 

She went white. “You can give 
yourself ten marks for that,” she 
said bitterly. “I made a mistake 
all right. Now let’s go back.” 

“I haven’t had my three guess- 
es yet. One — you can’t make up 
your mind whether to leave 
Earth or stay.”

“Wrong. I’m staying, but I 
don’t really care much.” 

“Two — you love Wili, and he 
won’t have anything to do with 
you.” 

She didn’t do a thing. She sim- 
ply stood still and stared at me, 
expressionless. 

“Three — ” I said, “that being 
so, you’ve dedicated your life 
to showing everyone how com- 
pletely your heart is broken.” 
Her eyes flashed dangerously 
at that. But presently she had 
control of herself again. “It’s 
none of your business,” she said 
at last. “It isn’t Wili anyway. 
And it has absolutely nothing to 
do with you and why you’re here, 
so forget it, will you?” 

T can’t very well do that.” 

We were sitting on a hump of 
grass. I took Jan’s hand. She 
seemed too surprised to do any- 
thing about it. It hadn’t occurred 
to her, apparently, that my kiss- 
ing her like that had been any- 
thing more than a conventional 
recognition of the fact that she 
was an attractive girl. 

“No,” I admitted, “perhaps it 
has nothing to do with why 
I’m here. But things don’t come 
neatly packaged, ever3dhing par- 
titioned off from everything else. 
They mingle with each other — 
anyway, I can’t just forget it, 
Jan. Would you laugh if I said 
I fell in love with you at first 
' sight?” 



“I’m not laughing,” said Jan. 
“But you’re exaggerating.” 

“A little. But it’s true that, 
since I first saw you, I’ve wanted 
to know you better, find out more 
about you ...” 

She moved restless!^ and freed 
her hand. “Look, Tony,” she said, 
not unkindly, “I still think you’d 
better forget the whole thing.” 
“Isn’t there anything I can 
do?” 

“About what? Never mind. 
Let’s go back. This time I mean 
it.” 

We went back then, after one 
of the most unsatisfactory love 
scenes in history. 

Ill 

I T was probably my preoccupa- 
tion with Jan which prevented 
me from seeing something very 
obvious about the Terrans for 
so long. The course of Tylo’s 
possibly true love was running 
much more smoothly. She adored 
Wili more and more every day 
and he seemed quite prepared to 
reciprocate. I didn’t interfere. I 
didn’t think Tylo’s intuition 
would let her down. She would 
know when to advance and when 
to retreat. 

She was with me in the control 
room one sunny afternoon when 
half a dozen young Terrans, Wili 
and Jan among them, came out 
and dropped lazily on the grass

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



between the ship and the town- 
ship to sun-bathe. I glanced 
quizzically at the wall thermo- 
meter. Sixty-one, and if that was 
in the shade it was also out of 
the light breeze that was blowing 
outside. Still, for Lenny Valley 
it was undoubtedly a warm day 
and the Terrans were used to 
slightly lower temperatures than 
we were. 

“Tony,” said Tylo hesitantly, 
looking out at them. 

“Yes?” 

“Do you think they’d mind if 
I went out and joined them?” 

“Not in the least.” 

I thought she was hinting that 
I should go out with her too, for 
company, but I had something 
else in mind. I wanted to look 
closely at the Terrans when they 
didn’t know I was looking at 
them. I wanted to hear what they 
said, in case they dropped some 
clue about why they were re- 
maining so stubbornly, so unrea- 
sonably on a world which could 
support them for only a short 
time longer. 

Tylo hesitated a little longer, 
then went out. The Terrans were 
two hundred yards from the ship, 
but in my control room I had 
gadgets I could use to count the 
hairs on their heads if I liked. 
Merely hearing what they said, 
bringing them to within an ap- 
parent six feet of my eyes, was 
nothing. 



I looked at Jan first, of course. 
Now that I had some sort of key 
to her personality, I seemed to 
understand her better every time 
I saw her. Her emotions were too 
deep. She was the kind of person 
who was always liable to be hurt, 
and seriously hurt, by things 
which would trouble others for 
five minutes and, then be forgot- 
ten. 

She had loved, not wisely, but 
too well. And I began to sense 
whom she had loved. There was 
something taut about the way 
she looked at Tian, something 
strained about the way he smiled 
at her. Tian was married to 
Meni, who was there, too. I didn’t 
try to guess what had happened. 
The details didn’t matter. What 
did matter was that Jan had re- 
ceive'd a wound that wasn’t heal- 
ing as it should. 

I^VERYTHING the Terrans 
made, everything they wore, 
showed what an artistic people 
they were. When Tylo joined the 
group of sun-bathers, the differ- 
ence between her and the others 
was a mild shock. She had put on 
a bathing suit, the usual two- 
piece affair, and on any of the 
Federation worlds the result 
would have been declared just 
about perfect. 

Beside Jan’s outfit, however, 
Tylo’s was suddenly crude, even 
a little embarrassing. It covered 



MEN LIKE MULES 



139 



what was usually covered and 
went to great trouble not to 
cover anything else. Tylo wasn’t 
dressed, she was censored. Jan, 
on the other hand, wore a lovely 
asymmetrical sunsuit, which was 
equally unconcerned at revealing 
a lot that Tylo’s covered and at 
concealing much that might de- 
cently have been exposed. It was 
fine art beside shoddy work- 
manship. 

Rather to my surprise, Tylo 
noticed fiiis at once. She wanted 
to borrow a sunsuit like the Ter- 
ran girls’, and seemed puzzled 
when they all agreed it was im- 
possible. 

“Nothing that anyone wears 
can ever suit anyone else ex- 
actly,” Meni explained. “If it’s 
right for you, it must have been 
utterly wrong for whoever lent 
you it.” 

“Surely a sunsuit like Jan’s 
. ?” murmured Tylo hesitantly. 

“No,” said Meni decidedly. 
“Definitely not! You and Jan . .” 
And she went on to point out 
the various anatomical differ- 
ences, differences of muscular 
tension and differences in pat- 
terns of movement, that made 
Jan’s suit quite impossible for 
Tylo. Tylo agreed doubtfully, 
not .pretending to an artistic ap- 
preciation she didn’t have. 

“Later,” Meni promised, “I’ll 
make you a dress.” 

“The Naval uniform,” Wili ob- 



served, “happens to suit your 
brother. He looks quite passable 
in it. But not you, Tylo. Promise 
you’ll never wear it again while 
you’re here.” 

“I promise,” said Tylo hap- 
pily, glad to be able to promise 
Wili an3dhing. 

nPHEY talked about sun-bath- 
ing, swimming and then about 
the Terran way of life in general. 
Tylo diffidently mentioned, from 
her experience of other worlds, 
a few changes which would soon 
have to be made. 

The Terrans agreed placidly 
with every word she said. 

That was the inexplicable thing 
about it all. It would have made 
some kind of sense if the Terrans 
had argued about the future 
and declared passionately that 
the Sun would never die. But 
they agreed, with the utmost rea- 
sonableness, that soon the kind 
of life they were living would be 
impossible. 

I know I was dumb. It wasn’t 
until I had ceased to pay any 
attention to what Tylo and the 
Terrans were saying, and had 
lost myself in rather wistful con- 
templation of Jan’s charms, that 
I caught my first glimpse of the 
obvious. I cursed myself briefly, 
thought for a moment and went ' 
out after Tylo. 

I went straight to the sun- 
bathers and looked down at Wili.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“I suppose I should be ashamed 
of myself,” I said, “but it’s only 
just struck me that you must 
have a refuge somewhere.” 

Jan looked up with a shadow 
of a smile. I got the impression 
she was mildly glad I’d worked 
that out at last, as if the other 
Terrans had said I was too stu- 
pid to see it and she’d said I 
wasn’t. 

“You must have atomic power, 
of course,” I went on, “though 
you don’t use it here. You haven’t 
forgotten your science, after all. 
You’re just having a last holi- 
day from a mechanized culture 
before you retire to it for ever. 
You prefer even a mechanized 
culture on Earth to any kind of 
life anywhere else.” 

Wili nodded coolly. “You’ve 
even got the name,” he said. 
“That’s exactly what we call it 
—Refuge.” 

“Underground?” 

“No. It’s in a valley like this.” 
“Then what’s the point? How 
is it a refuge?” 

“Tomorrow,” said Wili, “we’ll 
take you and Tylo to see it. 
Then you’ll know.” 

rr'HEY seemed quite uncon- 
cemed. It wasn’t clear wheth- 
er they’d been hoping I wouldn’t 
see that they must have a second 
string to their bow if they seri- 
ously intended to remain on 
Earth, or had expected me to see 



it long since. They were so sim- 
ply, so completely sophisticated 
that a Yahoo like me was always 
in deep water. 

Soon after that, Tian, Meni 
and Tylo went away together. 
Gradually, Jan and I were alone, 
and we had another of our frus- 
trating interludes. 

I needn’t set down in detail 
what I said — it was sincere and 
thoroughly conventional. I even 
told her I couldn’t live without 
her. 

She listened indifferently and 
said at last, “Kiss me.” 

“Why?” I asked perversely. 
“What good would it do?” 

“What good does anything 
ever do?” asked Jan chacteristic- 
ally. 

“I want you, not a kiss and a 
hug that only makes me want 
you more.” 

“Then you can have me.” 

I gaped. “What do you mean?” 

“That! We’re rather a moral 
lot as a rule, we Terrans. The 
others won’t approve. But I don’t 
think it matters. Where and 
when?” 

I had a strange, tight feeling 
inside me that I couldn’t identify. 
“That wasn’t what I had in 
mind,” I said, my voice seeming 
to come from a long way off. 
“I want to marry you.” 

“That would be stupid. If I 
still care for anything, it’s keep- 
ing my word. I wouldn’t make 



MEN LIKE MULES 



Ml 



all those marriage vows when 
I don’t mean them.” 

“What’s the matter with you, 
Jan? Tian isn’t worth it. No- 
body’s worth it!” 

“So you know it’s Tian.” 
“Never mind that. Because you 
can’t have the man you want, it 
isn’t the end of everything.” 
That rare flash of humor came 
out from the shadows and she 
actually smiled. “I thought you 
said a moment ago that you 
couldn’t live without me?” she 
said. 

I took the only way out of it. 
“That was a lie,” I said. “I 
could live without you, but I’d 
rather not.” 

She smiled again, but the bit- 
terness was back. Involuntarily I 
dropped beside her. I only want- 
ed, obscurely, to protect her, but 
when I touched her all my good 
resolutions dissolved. I kissed her 
again and again, holding her 
first this way, then that. I kissed 
her arms and her throat and her 
shoulders, knowing that next sec- 
ond I should have to get up and 
be calm and controlled, but not 
this second, not this kiss. 

t'VENTUALLY, however, we 
reached the point when I had 
to let her go and force myself 
away from her. I was controlled, 
though I wasn’t calm. 

“I’m sorry,” I said flatly. 
“What for? I wasn’t fighting.” 



True, but she hadn’t been re- 
sponding either — not really. 

“What would free you?” I 
asked. “If Tian died, would that 
do it?” 

“You’re not thinking of killing 
him, are you?” 

“Would that free you?” I per- 
sisted. 

“I think I’ve always known,” 
she said slowly, “that I could 
free myself whenever I liked.” 

“Then why not do it and stop 
play-acting?” 

She was annoyed. “Who’s 
play-acting?” 

“You, with your don’t-care, 
nothing-matters pose. You’re 
pretending to everybody, particu- 
larly yourself, that yours was 
such a great, true love that when 
Tian wouldn’t have you your 
whole life was wasted.” 

“Go away,” she said. She was 
rigid with fury. Her muscles were 
taut and she panted a little. I 
had never seen anyone so visibly, 
physically angry. 

I wanted to stay and make her 
release all that passion, somehow. 
Without being a psychologist, I 
felt it must be a good thing for 
her to get some of that violence 
out of her. But I didn’t know 
what she might do, and I couldn’t 
afford to let her interfere with 
my main job on Earth. 

I turned and walked toward 
the ship, without ^ glance back at 
Jan.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



AJj^ORDS often seem to be in- 
™ adequate to describe Earth 
and the Terrans. And if that was 
true of their voices, their appear- 
ance, their clothes and the simple 
buildings of Lenn, how much 
more true it was of Refuge. 

Wili had invited only Tylo 
and me and I didn’t ask to take 
the rest of my crew along. Of 
the Terrans, there were Wili, 
Tian, Meni, Martin and Jan. Jan 
neither sought my company nor 
made any attempt to avoid it. 
She ignored completely the in- 
cident of the day before. 

I wore my uniform, secure in 
the knowledge that I looked 
quite passable in it. I was also 
fully aware how obvious it was 
that I was a man from another 
world. Tylo was already almost 
assimilated by the Terrans, for 
though she still moved as she 
always had, she was wearing 
the dress Meni had made for 
her, and it subtly added grace to 
everything she did. Her voice 
had always been soft and musi- 
cal, more like the Terrans’ than 
most Federation voices. Now she 
was frankly imitating their 
speech, with fair success, for her 
ear for music was better than 
her eye for beauty. 

The clothes the Terrans and 
Tylo wore for the expedition 
should have given me a strong 
clue about Refuge. They were 
as simple as ever, but they sug- 



gested a much more highly civil- 
ized, less primitive culture. They 
weren’t meant to keep the wearer 
warm, for one thing. The Ter- 
rans weren’t in the slightest con- 
cerned about Federation stand- 
ards of modesty, judging by the 
way Jan’s breasts and Tylo’s 
tummy were incorporated in the 
very design of the dresses they 
wore. Yet no one wore anything 
which was sexy or exhibitionist. 

In the cases of Jan and Tylo, 
as in the others, one could see 
that the aim was pure beauty, 
not sensuality, and that it had 
been gloriously achieved. I didn’t 
feel in the least disturbed on 
Tylo’s account, as I would have 
been, say, if she had made a simi- 
lar exhibition of herself at a 
Yunian ball. 

The subway was the first sur- 
prise, but in view of the rest 
it’s hardly worth mentioning. In 
one of the buildings we hadn’t 
previously been inside, we went 
downstairs and found ourselves 
in a nicely designed subway sta- 
tion. We had known that the 
Terrans had available to them 
the mature technology which had 
built the starships, but this was 
the first indication that they still 
used any of it. 

f’^HERE was no way of telling 
how far the car took us. Since 
the tunnel was a sealed vacuum, 
it may have gone pretty fast —

acceleration was so smooth that 
it didn’t tell us much. Tylo in- 
genuously asked how far we were 
going, but Wili, who had been 
attending her very closely since 
we started, merely smiled and 
shook his head. 

I sat in back with Jan. There 
was a tacit understanding among 
the Terrans that Jan and I, and 
Wili and Tylo, should be left to- 
gether. They neither forced 
themselves on us nor embar- 
rassed us by leaving us too ob- 
viously to ourselves. 

“If Wili marries Tylo,” Jan 
remarked suddenly, “will she 
stay here?” 

The question wasn’t merely 
startling, it left me no possible 
answer. As far as I was concern- 
ed, the question of the Terrans 
remaining on Earth didn’t arise. 
Far less, then, did the question of 
Tylo staying too. 

I said the only thing I could 
think of. “If you marry me, will 
you come to Yuny?” 

She was less bitter and resent- 
ful, a much more pleasant com- 
panion than usual — which seemed 
strange after our last conversa- 
tion. She said easily, “Let’s leave 
out the first part and consider 
the second. Would I go to Yuny? 
Certainly, on a visit. But I think 
I’d come back here in the end.” 

“Because of the place or the 
people?” 

“The people. Earth counts less 



to me as a place than it does to 
most of the others. But you 
know something of our life here. 
Does anything like it exist any- 
where else?” 

“No,” I admitted. “You 
wouldn’t consider going away, 
and staying away, because of 
Tian?” 

“I have— often.” 

“Will you consider it again?” 

“Yes.” 

We were interrupted then. But 
that, short as it was, was the 
most satisfactory conversation 
I’d ever had with Jan. 

IV 

W HAT can I say about Re- 
fuge? Think of ancient 
Babylon, Rome, Athens, Paris, 
London, New York. Think of 
Neris on Yuny, Phalan on Col- 
ahima, Mercosant on Smithson, 
Sanctuary on Carone. Think of 
a city which everyone would have 
to agree was a little better, a 
little more beautiful, a little 
greater than any of these — and 
that’s Refuge. Don’t try to ima- 
gine it much better, much more 
beautiful. The imagination balks 
at that. 

It wasn’t a huge city, yet it 
was clearly built for many more 
than the seven thousand Ter- 
rans. 

“When we come here,” explain- 
ed Wili, “we’ll multiply again. 



144 



GALAXy SCIENCE FICTION 



Perhaps Earth will one day have 
a city of a million people once 
more.” 

“Why not come here now?” 
I asked, looking around me in 
wonder. 

“Why should we? This is Re- 
fuge, when we need it. You see 
it’s also in a valley, like Lenn. 
Presently, we’ll show you the 
difference.” 

I could guess the difference. 
Lenn was a simple little town. 
Refuge was not only a great 
city, it was a powerful, versatile, 
clever city. The magnificent 
buildings were a blend of art and 
science. The art of the Terrans 
I had already seen — not till I 
saw Refuge did I see their science. 

The exploration ship hadn’t 
reported *this. The exploration 
ship hadn’t known about this. 
When one saw it, the Terrans 
became at once not idyllic primi- 
tives, but a still-great people. At 
a glance, I knew that the Terrans 
would be able to control the 
weather in this valley, heat the 
houses and the streets and the 
very air if necessary, carve out 
from the atmosphere above ex- 
actly the conditions they wanted. 
I knew they could put a dome 
over the city whenever they liked, 
and live in comfort, independent 
of the Sun and the conditions 
elsewhere on Earth. I knew that 
I was looking at a self-contained, 
almost immortal city. 



“Only a few people live here 
at the moment,” said Wili. “Per- 
haps a score. They are merely 
caretakers — everything is com- 
plete, ready for us, when we are 
ready to come.” 

So far, I was only looking 
around. That was enough for 
me, without considering the im- 
plications of what I saw. Tylo 
wasn’t saying anything. She just 
stared. 

We walked through the empty 
streets. Usually, there’s some- 
thing grim about an empty city, 
but that’s because there’s some- 
thing grim behind the city being 
empty. Refuge was warm and 
friendly, like a new coat ready 
to be worn. It didn’t seem dead 
at all — doors opened at a touch, 
everything was spotless, every- 
thing worked when Wili showed 
us things. It was a production 
without a single flaw. 

I" saw now why the Terrans 
were dressed as they were. » 
Their clothes were just right for 
a city like this. It would never 
be too cold or too hot here. It 
would never rain or snow unless 
the Terrans wanted it to rain or 
snow. Clothes, yes, it wasn’t the 
kind of city in which people 
would wander about naked. But 
clothes needed to supply no pro- 
tection against the elements there. 
They would never be blown 
about capriciously by unwanted 



MEN LIKE MULES 



145 



winds. They would never be 
caught in crude machinery or on 
hard, sharp corners. 

Perhaps I was the wrong man 
to have been assigned this job. 
Thousands of captains would 
have seen only buildings in Re- 
fuge. But I saw more. I had 
enough appreciation of the 
beauty and magnificence of Re- 
fuge to overwhelm me and tell 
me one thing plainly. 

I was going to fail. My orders 
were uncompromising — evacuate 
the Terrans. Not for their own 
sake, not really because Earth 
couldn’t support them, but so 
that, for everyone in the Federa- 
tion, a neat line could be drawn 
after the story of Earth, and 
people would cease to be con- 
cerned and sentimental about it. 

I was no politician. I was sim- 
ply supposed to do as I was told, 
without weighing the pros and 
cons of what was really a politi- 
cal and economic situation. I 
wasn’t even a psychologist. It 
wasn’t for me to say, “The Ter- 
rans are perfectly safe. They can 
look after themselves, so I left 
them. And anyway, I think 
you’re wrong — it doesn’t do any 
harm for people to be sentiment- 
al ^bout Earth.” 

I went on automatically asking 
Wili questions, filling in the gaps. 

“We haven’t been building it 
for very long,” Wili told us. 
“Only about fifteen years or so. 



And as you see, it was planned 
and built as a unit. There have 
been no afterthoughts. At the 
same time, the original plan al- 
lowed for any expansion which • 
may be necessary later.” 

^^YLO was looking at me re- 
proachfully. I was monopoli- 
zing Wili, when I could be 
putting my questions to any of 
the Terrans. Tylo had got over 
her wonder. She still gave little 
delighted exclamations now and 
then, but she had already ac- 
cepted the fact of the city. 

I dropped back beside Jan. 

“Well?” she said quizzically. 

I knew the extent of her ques- 
tion. She was thinking of our 
conversation in the tube, of Wili 
and Tylo, of herself and me, of 
my orders to evacuate the Ter- 
rans. I went to what seemed the 
root of the matter. 

“This won’t make the slightest 
difference to the Federation,” I 
said thoughtfully. “It does to me, 
but then I’m not the Federation, 
or the Navy for that matter. 
What’s a city to the Federation? 
There must be hundreds of thou- 
sands of cities in the ninety-odd 
worlds. The Federation wants 
you people away from here. It’s 
a move in a big game, a game 
that has nothing to do with me.” 

Jan looked mildly interested, 
for once. “It might be fun to 
watch a big game like that closer

at hand,” she said. “But surely, 
your job ends with going back 
and reporting that we won’t 
leave, that we can look after our- 
selves?” 

I shook my head. “Not in the 
least. This won’t make the Fed- 
eration change its mind. Rather 
the reverse, I guess. For, if peo- 
ple heard about Refuge, they’d 
all want to see it. And, instead 
of Earth being written off, there 
would be a constant stream of 
tourists coming back here. A lot 
of people would even want to 
live here.” 

Jan nodded. “That’s why Wili 
didn’t want you to know about 
Refuge, if it could be avoided. 
He knew it wasn’t likely that it 
could, but there was no harm in 
trying. We don’t want your peo- 
ple here, Tony. They wouldn’t 
fit in this world among us. I 
don’t mean people like you and 
Tylo — people like you will come 
back and we’ll welcome them. 
But the others — have the other 
five in your crew ever remotely 
understood us?” 

I knew they hadn’t. “But that’s 
a minor thing,” I said. “Suppose 
I did go back and report as you 
suggest. If the Federation doesn’t 
change its mind — and it won’t — 
it’ll merely send out someone 
else to do my job. My going 
back won’t solve anything. 
You’ve got to leave, Jan.” 

She merely smiled. 



r had known all along about 
this other, more pleasant, 
more interested Jan. I couldn’t 
have loved her if I hadn’t. But 
this was the first time she had 
come into the open, and I didn’t 
know what I wanted to do more 
— evacuate Earth, Jan with the 
rest, or try to make headway with 
Jan and forget the business of 
evacuation. There comes a time 
when one’s private life is more 
important than one’s public duty, 
and I had almost reached that 
stage over Jan. 

We had dropped well behind 
the others. Wili must have notic- 
ed it, but didn’t appear to mind. 
Jan took a turning that led us 
away from the group ahead. I 
didn’t comment. 

Presently Jan motioned me up 
shallow stone steps to a door. 
“I’m going to live here,” she 
said. “We’ve even settled where 
we’re going to live, you see.” We 
went inside. 

“And aren’t you impatient to 
come and live here?” 

She smiled with a touch of the 
old bitterness. “Me, impatient for 
anything?” 

When she put it that way, it 
did sound ridiculous. I couldn’t 
imagine Jan being excited, anti- 
cipating the pleasure of the fu- 
ture. She had decided that there 
was probably no future and 
certainly no pleasure in it. 

“No, but the others?” I said.

“We’re not impatient people. 
Besides, there’s a reluctance to 
go in before it rains, so to speak. 
We have such a short time to 
live on Earth as people have 
lived since before history began 
— ^d Refuge will last forever. 
You see?” 

She broke off her explanation, 
because by this time we were 
in what looked like a lounge. It 
was comfortable, but not ridicu- 
lously luxurious. The Terrans 
held no brief for discomfort, but 
there were a lot of thirigs they 
rated higher. The chairs, for 
example, were as beautiful as 
possible, not as comfortable as 
possible. They weren’t bulbous 
and cushiony as the most luxuri- 
ous armchairs are. 

J AN pirouetted in the center of 
the room. She was so nearly 
happy, and we were getting on 
so well together, that I knew 
something was due to go wrong 
any moment. When and if Jan 
gave up the Tian myth, the 
ghost of her love for Tian, I 
would know. She hadn’t done it 
yet. 

“What are you going to do?” 
she asked. 

An idea of what I must do was 
forming in my mind. But I 
couldn’t tell Jan. “Forget it,” I 
said. “We’ve said all we can say 
on that subject.” 

She nodded. An odd expression 



came into her eyes. It wasn’t 
resentment, it wasn’t bitterness, 
it wasn’t her occasional wry hu- 
mor. It looked almost like long- 
ing. I mistrusted it. 

I did mistrust Jan. I wanted 
her, not as she was, but as she 
could be. 

“I like you, Tony,” she said 
unexpectedly. “Do you really 
think it would be wrong if 
we . ?” 

I weakened. Feeling as I did 
about Jan, I could turn down an 
offer like that only once. 

“No,” I said, my voice coming 
from far away again. “I don’t 
really think it would be wrong.” 

We kissed .and clung to each 
other. Jan bent up one leg be- 
hind her in that curious, delight- 
ed way woman have. It was com- 
pletely different from the last 
time. It was wonderful and every- 
thing I felt was new to me, for 
I had never held in my arms a 
woman I loved a quarter as much 
as I loved Jan. 

That made it different from 
anything that had ever happened 
to me before, and I knew it 
wasn’t wrong, after all. I kissed 
Jan’s forehead tenderly. 

Then suddenly she burst into 
bitter tears and beat my chest 
with her fists. “You’re not Tian! 
You’re not Tian!” she cried over 
and over again. But she recover- 
ed herself before I had to slap 
her.

f^YLO wanted to stay with 
Meni and Tian when we got 
back. I indicated silently but 
clearly that I wanted her back 
at the ship with me. Jim and 
Mary met us as we went to my 
cabin, asking what we’d seen 
and staring wide-eyed at Tylo, 
but I left them with their mouths 
open and shut the door of the 
cabin behind us. 

“What’s the matter?” asked 
Tylo, puzzled. 

I looked at her as if I had 
never seen her before. I was in 
a foul mood. I stared her up and 
down and, under my gaze, she 
went as red as a tomato. She 
hadn’t been able to change com- 
pletely in a few hours — ^the stares 
of Jim, Mary and me reminded 
her forcefully that no decent girl 
would wear a dress like that in 
public. 

“Take that filthy thing off and 
put on your uniform,” I said. 
“Then come back here.” 

I had succeeded magnificently 
in making her miserable and 
ashamed, but she stood still. 

“Do as I tell you,” I shouted. 

“I promised Wili,” she said in 
a small voice. 

“Oh — never mind. The Ter- 
rans themselves have shown us 
how to evacuate them,” I said. 
“Now we merely have to find 
. Refuge, destroy it, and they’ll — ” 

“No!” exclaimed Tylo, her face 
ashen. “You can’t do that.” 



“Why not?” I said fiercely. 
“Our job is to carry out orders, 
and the Navy will blink at any 
little irregularity we may commit 
in doing so.” 

“It’s not any little irregularity 
to destroy Refuge!” Tylo critd, 
grasping my arm tightly. “It’s 
a crime!” 

“With Refuge gone,” I said 
savagely, “they’ll have to come 
with us. That’s the only thing 
that’s enabled them to refuse. 
They can’t build it again — we 
could nifeke sure they hadn’t so 
much as a screwdriver to start 
making another atom plant. It’s 
what we’re here to do.” 

“You’re mad,” said Tylo. 
“You don’t mean it. You under- 
stand the Terrans better than 
I do. You understand better 
than I do what a magnificent 
thing Refuge is.” 

“All right,” I said more calmly. 
“So they can build another. We’ll 
give them a planet — a new, young 
world with a warm sun. They can 
make a better Refuge, and they 
won’t need a dome to imprison 
themselves when their world dies. 
What’s so wonderful about old, 
dead Earth? I tell you. Refuge is 
going to- be blasted to dust, and 
the Navy won’t strip me, it’ll 
congratulate me.” 

OHE said, “You can’t kill the 
^ people who are living there, 
you fool!”

“No, I’ll have to get them out 
first, then smash the city. They 
won’t have weapons. Even if they 
have, we — ’’ 

“You can’t do it, Tony,” said 
Tylo. The first wild horror was 
gone. She spoke passionately, but 
seriously. “If you harmed Refuge, 
you’d never be able to forget it. 
I’m talking about you, not the 
Federation or the Navy or the 
Terrans.” 

Once again she had found the 
right thing to say without really 
working it out. I calmed down 
some more. 

“I’ve got no choice, Tylo,” I 
said. “Suppose I went back and 
reported, the first thing they’d 
say would be, ‘You didn’t have 
any chance to sabotage this so- 
called Refuge and take the fools 
away, did you?’ And I can’t see 
myself telling them, ‘Yes, I could 
have done that, but it was such 
a pretty little city I hadn’t the 
heart to do it.’ ” 

“Refuge isn’t a pretty little 
city. I’m going to live there with 
Wili when we can’t live in Lenn 
any longer.” 

For a moment I almost let that 
influence me. “Has he asked 
you?” 1 demanded. 

“No, but he will. I know he’ll 
ask me.” 

“You’ll be much more use to 
Wili on a young planet,” I said. 

Tylo snatched the door open 
and was gone. She moved so 



quickly that, though I’d been 
watching her closely, ready for 
anything she might do, she was 
in the passage before I could 
move. The door, slammed hard, 
hit me as I went after her. By 
the time I got to the airlock, 
she was almost in the streets 
of Lenn and still running faster 
than I could. 

I closed the airlock. That 
meant I had to act right away. 
I bumped into Mary and Jim 
again and got them busy. The 
node was in the air in two 
minutes. 

If there were any defenses, Wili 
would have time to get them in 
operation, for I didn’t know ex- 
actly where Refuge* was. How- 
ever, I had carefully noted the 
position of the Sun at Lenn and 
at Refuge, and had a good idea 
where to go. With luck, Wili 
would warn the twenty people in 
Refuge to get clear. 

A NYWAY, I knew I could 
safely destroy the main pow- 
er plant of the city. It wasn’t 
in operation and nobody lived 
in that district. The twenty care- 
takers were gathered in one cor- 
ner of Refuge and, if I was care- 
ful, I could raze section after 
section until they made for cover. 
When I was sure they were clear, 
I could finish the job. 

Jim and Mary and Ramon 
kept bothering me with ques- 



MEN LIKE MULES 



151 



tions, but I only told them we 
had to destroy an empty town. 
Otherwise, I ignored them. 

Over and over again I checked 
my orders mentally and my read- 
ing of the situation. The Feder- 
ation, I was certain, wanted 
Earth evacuated at any price — 
and now. Once Refuge was de- 
stroyed, and the Terrans were 
away, arguments would be a 
waste of time. That didn’t mean 
there wouldn’t be any — neverthe- 
less, the Navy lawyers could al- 
ways make a good case to defend 
a captain after he had done what 
the Navy wanted done. No, I 
didn’t have to worry on that 
score. Provided nobody was hurt, 
the Federation would merely lis- 
ten politely to any protests the 
Terrans might make, then gener- 
ously give them a newly charted 
world in full reparation. 

I found Refuge even more eas- 
ily than I had thought I would. 
From the air, in the fading light, 
it was a place of fairy beauty. 
Jim and the others exclaimed 
when they saw it. But they had 
seen the expression on my face. 
There was no argument. 

There was no apparent defense. 
We had our screens up as a mat- 
ter of course, but nothing was 
testing them. We came down 
closer, and I picked out a little 
group of people on the hillside 
north of the city. They had been 
warned, apparently. Everything 



was perfect. There was no fear 
of blast harming them, not with 
the precision weapons we were 
going to use. 

I set the ranger on the site of 
the power-plant. It would remain 
on the plant now, no matter what 
the ship did. I set a trial limit of 




17,000 yards, which might pos- 
sibly destroy the plant right 
away, but not probably. I put 
my finger on the button. 

V 

rpHEN I realized I’d been play- 
acting, just like Jan. I knew 
I should press the button — I 
wasn’t in any doubt about that. 



152 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



But I had never intended to do 
it. All I had said to Tylo was 
true. Nevertheless, if the Navy 
wanted Refuge destroyed, they 
would have to send someone else 
to do it. I couldn’t. 

Perhaps, at one time, I had 
thought my anger and bitterness 



said. “We’re going back.” 

The others didn’t understand, 
of course, but their faces showed 
relief. 

I wasn’t any more companion- 
able on the way back than I had 
been on the way to Refuge. I 
knew now I had failed. Obvious- 




at Jan might carry me through. 
Certainly, if I could have given 
the order for someone else to 
destroy the city, I might have 
done it. But as it was, I had only 
been barking vfithout any bite. 
I had made Tylo, who knew me 
better than anyone, think I was 
going to do it. I had almost made 
myself think I was going to do it. 

“Cancel those last remarks,” I 



ly, no further appeal to Wili 
would have any effect, and I 
didn’t think there was any point 
in threatening Refuge without 
intending to implement the 
threats. 

I set the ship down exactly 
where it had been before, as if 
I had merely been making a test 
flight. When the other noises 
stopped, I heard the ranger

clicking. It was still set on the 
power-plant at Refuge. 

I looked over at Lenn, expect- 
ing someone to come out. No one 
did for a while. For a moment I 
felt a little resentful, thinking 
they might come out and say 
they were glad I hadn’t destroyed 
Refuge after all. Then I grinned 
involuntarily at the idea of the 
Terrans weeping tears of grati- 
tude, because I hadn’t committed 
what even Tylo had called a 
crime. 

At last someone did appear, 
but it wasn’t Tylo. It was Jan, 
alone. 

I didn’t want my crew to hear 
what was said, so I went out 
and met her outside. 

For a full minute, we stood 
facing each other, not saying 
an3dhing. I couldn’t read Jan’s 
expression, which was unusual. 
As a rule, it was all too clear 
what she was thinking. 

“That was a silly thing to do, 
wasn’t it.^’’ she said at last. 

I shrugged. “I should have 
gone through with it,” I said. 
“Someone else will, later, unless 
you can get to work on the 
Federation or public opinion 
first.” 

She shook her head definitely. 
“You were never going to do it,” 
she said. “I knew that when Tylo 
told us what had happened.” 

“You know me better than 
Tylo?” 



“Perhaps. You made a scene 
because of what happened at 
Refuge, that’s all. You hurt Ty- 
lo because she was happy, and 
you weren’t. I know. I’ve done 
the same sort of thing myself.” 

W E smiled at each other. Jan’s 
smile was a little bitter, but 
I was used to that. 

“All right,” said Jan. “We’ll 
try it.” 

I knew what she meant. “De- 
spite the fact that I’m not Tian?” 
I asked wryly. I had to take it 
calmly, for if I’d let myself go 
I’d have done something crazy. 

“I don’t think I could pull that 
one again. It crept up on me. 
It was as much a surprise to me 
as it was to you. Anyway, Tony, 
I keep my word. If I go through 
those marriage vows with you. 
I’ll mean them.” 

We didn’t even kiss. It seemed 
we’d always done that in the 
wrong Circumstances, at the 
wrong time. 

“Wili wants to see you,” said 
Jan. 

“I thought he might.” 

“You won’t like what he has 
to say,” Jan warned. “Maybe 
it’ll damage your self-esteem. 
That’s why I told you this first.” 
She’d always been like that, 
really. She’d never been spoiled 
at the core — only around the 
edges. 

“I’ll wait here,” she said. 



154 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Tylo was with Wili, but she 
left us alone when I appeared. 
She wouldn’t meet my eye. I 
didn’t know whether she was 
still angry with me or not, but 
I didn’t think it was likely. 
Tylo couldn’t let the Sun go 
down on her wrath if she tried. 

Wili smiled and held out his 
hand. I took it. That made things 
a lot easier. 

“I gather from something Jan 
said,” I remarked, “that Refuge 
isn’t as easy to destroy as it 
looks?” 

“That is so. I don’t think any- 
one will ever actually attack 
Refuge. We aren’t going to re- 
present competition or a threat 
to anyone. But all the same, 
we’re prepared to defend it. Our 
weather-control, before we have 
to close the dome, will naturally 
work on a system of force-fields, 
enclosing masses of air and di- 
verting rain and snow. For or- 
dinary defense, we only have to 
reinforce this system. As you can 
imagine, power’s practically lim- 
itless. We don’t need Solar en- 
ergy. Atomic power is enough.” 

T nodded, noting he hadn’t 
told me much. That was rea- 
sonable. I’d h,^ve to report to 
Naval HQ., and he would natur- 
ally tell me only what he wanted 
to be in my report. 

“That wasn’t what I wanted to 
speak to you about, Tony,” said

Wili. He was mild and friendly, 
as ever. I was realizing now that 
Wili must have been careful all 
along to show me only one side 
of himself. Tylo couldn’t have 
fallen in love with the bland, 
imperturbable, featureless char- 
acter I knew. “You know Tylo is 
staying?’’ 

I nodded. 

“What will the Navy do about 
that?” 

“Nothing much. It would be 
different if it were a man, but 
the women officers often desert 
like that. If it were made a seri- 
ous offense, girls wouldn’t volun- 
teer. Besides, what happens 
largely depends on the captain’s 
report, and Tylo doesn’t have to 
worry about that.” 

Wili laughed. “The more I hear 
of this Navy of yours, the more 
I respect it. How do you feel 
about Tylo staying?” 

“I’m not sure. Do you really 
love her? Are you going to make 
her happy?” 

“Those are two very different 
questions. Do I really love her? 
No, probably. I don’t think I’m 
made for love as you understand 
it. I love everybody, not indivi- 
duals. But as to whether I’m go- 
ing to make her happy, I think 
I can assure you that I will. You 
know her — do you doubt that?’* 
No, I didn’t doubt that. I’d 
have thought Wili was a big 
beautiful hollow husk if it hadn’t 



been for his mighty intelligence. 
That made me think it more like- 
ly that I simply didn’t under- 
stand him. 

“One other thing,” said Wili. 
“You’re going back now, aren’t 
you?” 

That was what I meant. As 
soon as you decided a thing, he 
knew what you’d decided and 
took it for granted. 

“Yes,” I said, “I’m going back.” 
“I could let you go without 
saying anything,” Wili said 
thoughtfully, “but I think, since 
we’re going to be brothers, I 
should tell you how to make your 
report. If you make it clear you 
know why you were sent here, 
and what you were meant to do, 
it may make an enormous differ- 
ence to your career.” 

I was lost, completely. Wili 
sailed on serenely. “You believed 
all that rubbish you told Tylo 
about what the Federation really 
wants, didn’t you?” 

“It happens to be true,” I said. 
“Now look, Tony,” said Wili 
quietly. “Tylo hasn’t told me 
your orders, but I can guess what 
they are. You’re ordered to evac- 
uate us, but not told how, and 
the reason given is the sentiment- 
al importance of Earth among 
the Federation peoples, isn’t it?” 

OO this was the thing I wasn’t 
supposed even to hint to the 
Terrans. I could only nod.

“Do you think the exploration 
crew that was here two years ago 
was really deceived into think- 
ing we couldn’t look after our- 
selves?” 

“I don’t know. Perhaps not.” 

“Pardon my being absolutely 
frank. The Federation must have 
known we would refuse to go. 
The question then became a po- 
litical issue. A matter for discus- 
sion and arbitration, if anything 
was to be done, if they really 
wanted us to go. They knew we 
were by no means fools. Did they 
send a political mission with 
the power to treat with us and 
offer inducements? Did they send 
an experienced Naval force to 
capture and evacuate us against 
our will? They did not. They 
took neither the peaceful nor the 
warlike method of gaining their 
alleged end. 

“They sent — pardon me again 
— a newly promoted captain with 
impossible orders and a rather 
stupid crew. I think they under- 
estimated you, Tony. You came 
a lot nearer evacuating us than 
anyone could have expected. You 
might even, for all the Navy has 
done to the contrary, have pulled 
it off.” 

“You mean,” I exclaimed, 
“that I was never meant to do 
it?” 

He was patient. “Could you 
have been meant to succeed?” 

“But why send me?”

“I can’t be sure,” said Wili, 
with startling modesty, “but 
there are two possibilities. Either 
this was somehow forced on the 
Federation, possibly for the rea- 
sons stated in your orders, or 
you’ve been caught up in some 
maneuver which has Earth as 
its focal point. The first is quite 
possible. Your orders are then 
perfectly sound and honest, ex- 
cept that the Federation knew 
you would fail, and hoped then 
to have some other plan for deal- 
ing with the situation. 

“The second is a little less 
likely, I think. However, if this is 
the case, on your return, you’ll 
probably be ridiculed and thrown 
out of the Navy, perhaps with 
full pension as recompense. Still, 
that can be avoided if you make 
it very clear in your report thht 
you know precisely what the 
Federation was up to.” 

I was rather dazed when I left 
Wili. Dimly, I saw one or two 
things that made sense. 

W ITH conditions as they were, 
the Federation had clearly 
had to send a transport ship to 
evacuate Earth. Whether the Fed- 
eration actually wanted Earth 
evacuated, however, was another 
matter. Now that I came to think 
of it — even Council members 
had that soft spot for Earth, 
that glad feeling that someone 
was still there, that Earth wasn’t 



completely and utterly extinct. 

Certainly, on my record, I 
wasn’t any miracle-worker. Jan 
was right, it did damage my self- 
esteem a little to be told that I’d 
been sent out to fail. But then, 
I hadn’t entirely failed — not real- 
ly- 

Jan was waiting, as she *had 
promised. The nights on Earth 
were not only very dark now, 
they were colder, and it was al- 
most night now. I threw my 
tunic around her shoulders. 

“Will you come to Yuriy, 
Jan?” I asked. 

“Yes,” she said-and, from the 
sound of her voice as she went 
on, I knew she was smiling her 
wry smile. “It will be interesting 
to see what life is like, trillions 
of miles from Tian, married to 
someone else.” More confidently 
she went on, “I think I can beat 
it, Tony. Just be patient. It does 
seem that there’s more to life 
than there used to be — ^before 
you came here.” 

“And then,” I said, “after we’ve 
seen and done a few things, and 
I’ve resigned from the Navy, 
perhaps we’ll come back here.” 

She liked that. I could tell 
by the way she gripped my arm. 

“Perhaps,” I said quietly, 
“Earth had to get rid of all the 
restless ' spirits, the people in a 
hurry, before life here could be 
quite perfect.”

Forecast 

Langston had technicolor delusions. Inanimate objects came alive in his 
hands. THEY were persecuting him, out to get him. What a relief it was to 
know he wasn't going insane! Sounds contradictory, right enough, but you'll 
see why it isn't in next month's novella, THE TELENIZER by Don Thompson. 

There's a Theodore Sturgeon novelet, THE EDUCATION OF DRUSILLA 
STRANGE, which has as strange a moral as its heroine and her name; to 
wit, the grass invariably is greener on your own planet— even if there is no 
grass there and would not be that color if there were any! 

Young Garvin's world, in IRONCLAD, the supporting novelet by Algis 
Budrys, was one of simple laws: Walk with dignity, talk with dignity; above 
all, kill with dignity . and kill and killl
