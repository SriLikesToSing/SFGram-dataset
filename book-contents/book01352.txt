The “Hoax” Story 

by H. L. GOLD 



O nce a hoax has been established, 
it becomes the next worst thing 
to immortal. Years ago, for example, 
I reported — with a straight face, as 
befits the telling of a whopper — 
that parents bought their children 
baby alligators, which soon outgrew 
bowl, sin|| and bathtub and were 
flushed into the New York sewer 
system, where they flourished on the 
warmth and abundant food. Now the 
publicity department of that estima- 
ble system has a printed form 
refuting the “fact” that refuses to 
die. 

But confession doesn’t kill hoaxes. 
H. L. Mencken spent 20 minutes in- 
venting, and a lifetime disowning, the 
story that winter bathing was illegal 
in colonial Boston, yet you still keep 
encountering it. 

Every year, too, someone will de- 
clare that Jules Verne described the 
periscope so accurately that the sub- 
sequent inventor of it was denied a 
patent. It’s not so. 

Neither is the ever-repeated com- 
plaint of professional fans that to- 
day’s science fiction is lacking in 
science. This charge is much more 



elderly than you might think, going 
back to the late 19th century, when 
Verne, the elderly engineer of sf, 
bitterly attacked young upstart H.G. 
Wells, the basic researeher of sf, for 
not having Science in his fiction. 

There is room in this field for 
both kinds of writers, of course. But 
Verne lived to see most of his work 
become obsolete while Wells, with a 
handful of novels and a few dozen 
shorter stories, originated very many 
themes of modern sf. Serious people 
are working on Wells’s antigravity, 
which Verne denounced as fantasy, 
but who is working on Verne’s space- 
ship shot out of an enormous can- 
non, not to mention such funny ideas 
of his as clockwork machine guns 
and underwater bikes? 

This division of scientists and au- 
thors into basic researchers and en- 
gineers is a practical one. Insisting 
on either to the exclusion of the 
other is not practical. 

Naturally the engineer authors 
have more success in forecasting, 
working as they do on applications 
of existing knowledge. Sf is glad to 
accept applause for such successes,

but forecasting is not the primary 
function of sf. If it were, we’d have 
stories about the perfect clothes 
hanger and the like, exclusively. 

T o paraphrase a phrase-monger, 
the idea is the hero of sf . Here 
are some examples: 

It’s a commonplace statement that 
da Vinci invented the auto, airplane 
and air conditioning. Lacking motive 
power, he used what was available — 
springs and sails, human and animal 
muscle power. They were not good 
enough, though nothing was cheaper, 
and da Vinci, stuck fast to the 
knowledge of his time, as his fol- 
lowers were to theirs and we to ours, 
could not envision electricity and the 
internal combustion engine. Even if 
he had, how well could he have de- 
scribed them, much less work out 
the math and metallurgy, the chem- 
istry, physics and geology — the 
great number of disciplines that pro- 
duce and move these everyday won- 
ders? Could he then have gone a step 
further and predicted how these won- 
ders pollute the air and water, the 
extinction of whole species of life, 
the forced migration from farm too 
small to be machine-worked to the 
city strangling with people and ma- 
chines, the paving of more and more 
of our land so more and more ve- 
hicles can go murderously from one 
congested city to another? 

Thomas More’s Utopia had tele- 
phones, generations before they were 
invented. Instead of electric wires, 
however, he used something that the 
science of his day considered work- 
able: hollow tubes. Just imagine 
what a tangle that would be! 



Perhaps you remember Baron 
Munchausen’s tale of the Russian 
winter being so cold that it froze 
voices, which were heard when 
spring came. Nobody believed him, 
of course. Yet we freeze voices all 
the time, and music as well, and do 
not have to wait till spring to hear 
them. 

George Washington’s passionate 
plan to link up the vast new United 
States with an equally vast network 
of canals seemed entirely reason- 
able to his contemporaries, and it 
was pushed even more fervently a 
couple of decades later, when the 
Louisiana Purchase doubled the size 
of the infant country. The most op- 
timistic citizens estimated that it 
would take 25 generations — until 
2400 A.D. — to tame and colonize 
the additional 3,000,000 square 
miles. At that moment, in England 
and in New Jersey, two inventors 
were developing the steam locomo- 
tive. 

J ust about that time, the King, 
having inspected Faraday’s lab- 
oratory, asked: “Of what earthly use, 
Sir, are all these toys?” Faraday 
replied: “Of what earthly use, Sire, 
is a newborn baby?” Within their 
lifetimes, Faraday and Volta saw 
more progress than the millennia 
since electrical phenomena were 
first observed. Yet even they could 
not foresee, however dimly, the 
civilization built by electricity. 

Malthus predicted that population 
growth would always outstrip food 
production. It’s hard to say which 
would astonish him more, a world 
of three billion people or a nation 



6 




that bribes farmers to prevent glut. 
A doomsman, he’d no doubt point to 
the underfed parts of the globe, and, 
tragically, he would be right. But 
they could support their populations 
with modern methods — and huge 
areas of the world, like the interiors 
of South America, Africa, Australia, 
even Canada, are desperately under- 
populated. 

Berlioz was considered mad be- 
cause he scored his music for thou- 
sands of voices and instruments, be- 
lieving that the resulting sound 
would be that many times louder. It 
wouldn’t. But how was he to suspect 
that a neighbor, with just the touch 
of a heavy hand on a small dial, 
could drive us out of our homes 
with a volume that Berlioz could 
only dream of? 

Coming down almost to the pres- 
ent — to 1957, in fact — we sf 
writers casually had spaceships built 
by updated Wright brothers, never 
knowing that only a world power 

— and a big, rich one at that — 
could put a man on the Moon by 
spending so much of its treasure for 
so long a time. 

For that matter, whatever became 
of the spaceships we wrote about so 
knowingly, shiny on one side to re- 
flect heat, black on the other to 
absorb it? 

If you date back as far as I do 

— I sold my first story (at a very 
early age) in 1934 — you may re- 
member a greatly respected author 
suggesting that we develop “science 
secretaries” to cue in people of one 
science with the knowledge of an- 
other. Luckily, before the planet had 
to be scoured for such phenomenal 



minds, computers came along — lots 
of them, improving all the time, with 
memory banks able to hold all the 
sciences of all of mankind — and 
retrieval time in microseconds. 

W hat point am I trying to make? 

Just this: that the idea is the 
message both in science and science 
fiction, and that explaining future 
discoveries in terms of current knowl- 
edge must always prove as laughable 
as the examples I’ve given. 

But that must not stop the idea- 
sters. Their job is to get the idea 
written and published and read. 

In sf, that means presenting it 
entertainingly. And I submit that 
doubletalking characters in and out 
of time machines, starships and 
other standard themes of sf are not 
entertaining. For of what earthly 
use, dear critics of modern sf, are 
repetitions of tired old analogies that 
even now sound as hollow as tele- 
phone tubes, formulas and equations 
taken from textbooks and detailed 
just as thrillingly — while the reader 
is impatiently saying: “Okay, okay, 
so you’ve got robots (or androids or 
espers or whatever) — now what’s 
the story?” 

Certainly I exempt the fresh new 
idea, which comes along more often 
than sf is credited with and needs ex- 
planation, or even “explanation” — 
but with two reservations: a) it 
should be woven into the story in- 
stead of dumped in a lump in the 
reader’s lap; b) it should be taken 
for granted when, or if, it becomes a 
standard sf theme. 

That’s not much to ask, is it?

It was a crazy world where the 
mountains chased the Janes. But 
it was a world Hatch had to save I 



Illustrated by BROCK 



I 

Tj'rom two hundred miles out she 
-*■ looked like a cheap plastic 
beachball, the mottled kind, most- 
ly green but swirled with the dregs 
of every dyepot in the factory. 



From a hundred miles you could 
see the mountains, a strangely 
smooth ridge tracing a great circle 
through the poles. Stranger was the 
fact that they exactly followed the 
day-night shadow line. But strangest 
was that they stayed there, despite 



8 



the planet’s steady rotation, one 
turn every fourteen months. 

From five miles you could see 
that the swirls of color were vege- 
tation. The planet was completely 
immersed in an ocean of moss. 
Layer lived upon layer, with the 
upper strata rootless, flowing as 
freely as colored water. The only 
bare earth to be seen anywhere was 
at the top of the mountains. Near 
the equator, great sweeps of the 
moss were sun-charred. 

From two miles you became 
aware of her piddling gravity. 
Though twice the size of Mercury, 
she pulled barely three-quarters as 
hard as earth. Radar soundings 
would show her to be nearly core- 
less, a recently formed, loosely pack- 
ed dustball. But what was that 
silver necklace that ran around the 
equator, in a great circle perpendi- 
cular to the mountains? 

Dropping to a mile, you could 
make out individual beads in the 
necklace, sausage shaped and gigan- 
tic. Every now and then one would 
be prune-wrinkled or completely 
flat, like inflatable cells of some 
kind. 

And down there next to the neck- 
lace, barely in front of the moun- 
tains, was a dot. The dot was mo- 
bile; it moved against the planet’s 
rotation to keep itself in the sun. 

The dot was Hatch’s barge. 

S he shouldered her way across the 
landscape like a junkyard in 



search of a home. But there was 
majesty in her messiness, the sort 
that’s inspired by old ships in high 
seas, alone among the elements. 
Mossy swells groaned under her 
hull on their way to the mountains 
behind, which hung there in a dust- 
capped tidal wave forever threaten- 
ing to break. 

The moss varied in more than 
color; there were a thousand tex- 
tures and tastes, a million smells. 
Marjoram or something like it vied 
with minted marijuana and a dozen 
subtler scents. From every crest the 
wind tore fragrant spray. From 
every trough the salamanders fled 
like startled herring. 

The barge plowed along just 
just ahead of the twilight line, 
keeping a permanent sunset dead 
over the bow. From the planet’s 
dayside a sweaty gale panted in 
over the gunwales, on its way over 
the mountains to the nightside, 
where it would subside to a frozen 
breeze. Yet for all its turbulence, 
the air was eminently breathable, 
moist, supercharged with oxygen. 
Hatch liked the air there. But what 
about everything else? 

He didn’t particularly like the 
planet’s speed of rotation. He spent 
half his time wishing the silly dust- 
ball would spin faster; the other 
half, that it would stop dead. If 
it didn’t move at all, he wouldn’t 
have to, either. He could sit on the 
twiline or the dawnline living in 
ease. Or if it whirled around as fast

as old earth, the day-night tempera- 
ture differential would equalize and 
he could be comfortable anywhere. 

But a seven-month day could get 
surface temperatures up near four 
figures; and a seven-month night 
lowered them to the sub-thinkable. 

This temperature span, combined 
With the looseness of the crust, had 
another implication. Where the cold 
side of the planet met the hot, some 
truly remarkable thermal stresses 
built up. The crust bulged to re- 
lieve them. The result was a smooth 
wave of mountains that forever 
chased the dawnline and twiline 
and, incidentally, Hatch himself. 
Galloping alps, he called them. 

So Hatch daily told himself he 
hated the place, a sort of perverse 
prayer. 

But he loved it, really, and 
knew he did. It was a dizzy hell but 
it grew on you. And it was all his. 
He’d bought it from GS with his 
severance pay, the very day they’d 
stripped him of his uniform. 

His uniform at the moment was 
a pair of shorts. He’d set a course 
parallel to the abandoned silver sau- 
sages of the T-belt, locked in the 
autopilot, and had just begun the 
“ day’s” work. Coming down from 
the bridge, he headed toward the 
starboard side, picking his way 
through the clutter. At one time this 
hoverbarge had been a mining craft 
and her deck was a maze of exter- 
nal piping, lockers, deckhouses, and 
radio masts. 



B ut the whole starboard side had 
been cleared off. Amid the 
general disorder, it stood out as 
plainly as an aisle. It was empty 
of mossmen too, which was unusual; 
not a Joe or Jane in sight. Frown- 
ing, he went over to a control box 
on the rail, opened it, took out the 
headphones, put them on. 

Just as he thought, the taped 
message he’d programmed for 
broadcast wasn’t coming through at 
all. He didn’t know what had done 
it, but suspected the swivel con- 
nections up on the antenna itself. 

Which meant he’d have to climb 
up and have a look. It was the tal- 
lest mast aboard, forty feet, and it 
waved in the wind like a reed. He 
went aft, put on his tool belt, and 
shinnied up. 

Yes, that had been it. A few 
minutes’ work put it right again. 
Holding his giddy perch with knees 
and safety harness, he plugged his 
phones into the test circuit, and 
heard: 

“ — to the square floating object 
at the top of the moss. Don’t be 
afraid of the big hairless one who 
will meet you. He will show you 
where to lay your eggs. Remember, 
every egg you leave with him will 
have twice the chance of hatching. 
Why should you leave your eggs at 
the mercy of the mountains — ” It 
droned on but he listened to it no 
more, knowing it by heart despite 
its length, since he’d composed it. 
It went on in the repetitious man-

IF 




ner of a sound truck trying to get 
out the vote, repeating the same 
message a dozen different ways. 
It was simple-minded, but Hatch 
was not about to change a word. 
The translation had been done at 
the rate of a word a day; and then 
expressing it all in radar frequency 
blips so that the Joes and Janes 
could even hear it had taken him 
equally long. He climbed down. 

Almost to prove the thing was 
working again, a black shape clam- 
bered up out of the moss to greet 
him when he returned to the work 
area. 

A mossman is about the size and 
shape of a husky twelve-year-old. 
Detail differences included: fur 
(black) ; spatulate fingers and toes 
for navigating in the moss (three 
in a bunch and ten inches long; 
and a small-eared, small-eyed head 
that could have been Alley Oop 
carved out of a coconut. 

She was a Jane, clumsy with the 
eggs she carried, and somewhat 
afraid of Hatch. He began a rather 
gross charade of egg-laying, led her 
over to a small deckhouse with a 
canvas flap for a door, and pushed 
her through. While she was busy, 
he started up a relatively quiet 
radar recording which gave instruc- 
tions in their language for what 
he’d just done in gestures, for subse- 
quent visitors. 

’C'ven as he worked, another head 
appeared at the rail, and an- 

BESIDE THE WALKING MOUNTAINS 



other. Big day, it looked like. He 
went over to the rail. He must 
have hit a school. At least a hun- 
dred furry heads bobbed just off 
the beam. Hatch never lost his fas- 
cination for the sort of climbing 
swim by which they stayed afloat 
and moved about. Waving, he got 
hesitant waves in return. They had 
a dose-to-human intelligence and 
other anthropomorphic habits along 
with it. Waving was one. Almost 
any human could communicate with 
any mossman by sign language, 
given a little practice. 

Well, no need to hang about. 
The recording would keep the oper- 
ation going. As he turned back in- 
board he found his first customer 
waiting rather self-consdously for 
his attention. 

“What is it, Jane?” he gestured. 

“Your voice,” she pointed to the 
smaller bitchbox, “said he would 
be rewarded, and also be able to 
rest a while.” 

“By all means.” He clapped a 
comradely hand on her shoulder, 
and with no more than a startled 
wince of just-understanding, she re- 
turned the gesture. 

Another habit of theirs. Hatch 
laughed. She aped it, silently of 
course, incapable of anything more 
than a hiss. Mossmen normally com- 
municated by radar frequency 
yelps, generated by an auxiliary 
diaphragm, tucked behind their ster- 
nums. 

By now he’d led her back to the

still. He made a note to fill the 
hopper with more moss when he had 
the chance. Beside it was an array 
of fifty-gallon drums. Hatch con- 
sidered. 

He’d been on the white stuff late- 
ly himself, but didn’t know how 
the mossmen would react. While it 
didn’t come out as clear as the 
blues or greens, it had better man- 
ners. The sweet, oregano-tainted 
milk picked you up off the deck 
all right, but put you back gently. 

Still, no point in experimenting, 
not with the crowd he expected to- 
day. Better stick to the blue. He 
pried the bung from a barrel that 
smelled heavily of bayberry and 
mint, stuck a finger in, licked it. It 
tasted as it smelled, and gave him 
a blip of nirvana that lasted half a 
minute. Definitely good stuff. 

He tipped the barrel into a ten- 
foot trough. Jane didn’t know what 
to do right off — she got most 
of her water from the food she ate, 
like old earth Koalas — but he 
showed her. 

One slurp sent her shuffling gid- 
dily away in search of a place to 
sleep. And as she left, numbers two 
and three came around the corner. 
At this rate, in two hours there 
wouldn’t be a square foot of deck- 
space without a sleeping mossman. 

Next chore on the list was raking 
the decks clear of moss that had 
sprayed in while he was sleeping. 
He’d been at it for fifteen minutes 
when something caught his ear. 



A boom and then a thin whine. 

He squinted upward. The red 
sun had a mote in its eyes, which 
was growing bigger. 

Hatch hmm’d. A few tourists had 
been by in the last six years, whose 
company he’d generally enjoyed. 
But the landing sled dropping to- 
ward him now looked too big. He 
hurried inside to turn on the guide 
beacon, and to put on a shirt. 

He reappeared at the rail in time 
to see the sled drop to deck level 
some thirty yards off his beam, and 
match speeds. Noisy thing, it had 
sent the mossmen stampeding over- 
board to the security of the depths. 
The sled’s well painted hull had GS 
written all over it, literally and 
figuratively. He grimaced and went 
over to the line gun. 

But the sailor at her open hatch 
waved him off. No indeed, they’d 
shoot their line over to him. Shrug- 
ging, he stood back and watched 
the shot. 

The plastic blank looped over, 
dragging the string, got caught in 
the wind, fell short. Even from 
where he stood Hatch could hear 
the sarcastic berating being handed 
the sailor by someone inside. The 
voice was hauntingly familiar. 

A second shot made it over the 
rail, but would have dribbled back 
into the moss if Hatch hadn’t 
pounced on it. 

He pulled the string which pulled 



12 



IF 




the rope which pulled the cable 
from their sled to his hoverbarge. 
In ten minutes the pod had made 
two trips, depositing a nervous 
young sailor, and a female civilian 
on his deck. 

But the pod’s third load was one 
hundred and thirty pounds of bad 
luck. Richard J. Handy, Cdr., GSN 
— Hatch’s old Commanding Of- 
ficer — climbed out and saluted. 
Hatch half raised his arm, remem- 
bered he was a civilian, dropped it. 
It drew a rather nasty grin from 
Handy. 

“Hello, Hatch,” the thin man 
said. “How have you been?” 

“Well enough. You?” 

“Well enough. This is Miss Hollo- 
way of the Board of Estimate, and 
Personnelman McIntyre.” 

He nodded, shook hands, smiling 
dutifully but never taking his eyes 
from Handy’s. “What brings you 
here, Commander?” 

“Oh, we’ll get to that.” He 
glanced around the deck with 
pointed curiousity. “How’s this 
little operation of yours going? Why 
don’t you show us around?” 

TTe could see that Handy was 
* going to keep him on the hook 
for a while. Okay. He took them 
over to the work area. It was de- 
serted. He ran through an explana- 
tion of how he was collecting the 
eggs. Handy’s interest was the 
gloating kind, it seemed. McIntyre 
was too nervous to react at all. Ob- 



viously the sailor knew the score. 
Obviously the girl civilian didn’t. 
She was fascinated. 

“What are the eggs like?” she 
asked. He took her over to the lay- 
ing den, thrust open the flap. Moss- 
men smells billowed out. 

“They bury them in the dust on 
the floor here — see — which is 
what they normally do on the bot- 
tom of the ocean.” As he spoke, 
his quick hands sifted through the 
moist dust, coming up with hand- 
ful after handful of black, pimply 
bullets. 

“But there’re so many?” 

“Right. They survive like rabbits, 
only because of their prolificity.” 
He flashed a glance at Commander 
Handy, but the thin face was in- 
scrutable. Hatch stood up. “You 
see, the mountains move across the 
entire face of the planet, killing 
everything but the moss, every 
seven months. They also destroy 
all but a hundredth of one percent 
of the eggs.” 

“And what do you do with 
them?” she asked. Blue earnest 
eyes. 

“Fly them over the mountains.” 

“Why? Why can’t they handle 
the survival of their own species 
naturally? After all, didn’t they 
evolve here?” She had no. notion of 
the sort of bomb she’d just 
dropped. 

For a long moment Hatch studied 
the egg in his hand, rolling it be- 
tween two fingers. He didn’t trust

himself to look at Handy. “Well, 
it’s like this, Miss Holloway. Some 
time ago, a bunch of men opened 
up a transmutation plant down here, 
and the radiation almost killed 
them off.” 

The blue eyes widened. She point- 
ed at Handy. “But he wants 
to — ” 

Hatch’s turn to be startled. So 
that was it. 

Handy smirked. “Well, Hatch, I 
guess we can talk business now.” 

Hatch led them up to the obser- 
vation tower he used for living 
quarters. He had chairs enough, 
just. McIntyre set up a recorder, 
mumbled into it, nodded to the 
Commander. 

Throat being cleared. “Very well, 
then. Hatch, we’re going to buy 
back your planet. GS has decided 
to reopen the T-belt.” 

re going . Has decided . Hatch 
swallowed. Handy must be 
holding some pretty high cards. 
He’d forgotten what it was like to 
fear a man like this. But it all 
came flooding back, as vividly as 
the day of his Court Martial. 

Still, his guts weren’t jelly, he 
was no quivering McIntyre. Hatch 
shifted in his chair, almost physical- 
ly pulling himself together. 

“There was a time when you 
could say things like that to me, 
Handy. But I’m not in the service 
any more — thanks to you. And 
this isn’t government land any more. 



I’m a civilian and legal owner of 
this place. And I say — no sale.” 

Handy’s birdlike face was get- 
ting white around the beak. “Read, 
McIntyre.” 

The nervous sailor hopped erect, 
a five-by-eight in his hand, and 
began to recite. “Definition: Emin- 
ent domain is — ” He looked like a 
school kid sans homework, and at 
any other time Hatch would have 
laughed. Across the room, Hollo- 
way looked for a second as if she 
might too. 

“Definition: Eminent domain is 
the superior dominion of the sove- 
reign power over property within 
the state, which authorizes it to ap- 
propriate all or any part thereof to 
a necessary public use — reason- 
able compensation being made.” 

Hatch looked puzzled. 

McIntyre turned the card over. 
“Eminent Domain, Reference 311: 
The People vs. the colonists of Till- 
man, GS Circuit Court, Sixth Arm, 
Third Quarter. 2674. 

“It was established that, despite 
private ownership of the Planetoid 
Tillman, the colonists thereon must 
deliver same to public ownership 
for a reasonable price. Necessary 
public use was invoked since the 
core of said planetoid was the only 
known source of radioantigen 4-A 
in the galaxy, and an epidemic of 
intestinal cancer had broken out in 
the sixth arm, affecting humans and 
many other denizens thereof. 

“Precedent set: It was recognized 




BESIDE THE WALKING MOUNTAINS 



15 




that surrender of this planetoid 
would mean the death of the four- 
teen colonists, who had developed 
environmental, adaptive and other 
physiological dependencies on it. 

“While the court strongly deplor- 
ed the implications of such action, 
it was deemed just, in light of the 
disproportionately high number of 
GS citizens who might otherwise die 
of cancer.” 



AyT clntyre sat down. Hatch stood 
up, pointing angrily through 
the transplas wall at the string of 
silver beads resting out on the hori- 
zon. 



“That’s no goldmine of 4-A. 
That’s a broken down T-belt that 
makes ordinary fuel, and not very 
efficiently either. That’s a T-belt 
that should never have been opened, 
and wouldn’t have been if you 
hadn’t been so goddarrw stubborn. 
Just who decided it y s so necessary?” 

Handy’s face contorted, but to 
his credit; his voice was soft. “I 
have news for you, my friend. I’ve 
been reassigned. Do you have any 
idea what my new billet is?” Even 
softer now, the jaw quivering with 
malice. “I’m Adviser to the Presi- 
dent on Fuel Resources. I’ve de- 
clared a shortage. I’m going to re- 
open that belt. I’m going to get 
you, Hatch. I’m going to get — ” 
There were tears in the man’s eyes. 

Hatch’s face was rigid, stark 
white. McIntyre forgot to breathe. 
Holloway’s face filled with revul- 



sion. Finally, composing himself, the 
Commander got to his feet. 

“Miss Holloway will remain here 
a few days to assess your belong- 
ings and determine ‘reasonable 
compensation.’ ” He did an about 
face and walked out. McIntyre 
snapped the recorder shut, sprang 
up, scampered after. In five min- 
utes they’d both cabled over to the 
landing sled, and in ten it was a 
dot against the sun once again. 
Hatch squinted after them. 

“I’m sorry, Hatch,” said a timid 
voice beside him. 

“Sure you are,” he snorted, 
turning to her, rubbing his eyes. 

“Oh, but I am. I had no idea of 
this vendetta of his.” She said a lot 
more, which while not making him 
feel any better, succeeded in con- 
vincing him she was sincere. He 
looked her over. 

S he was cheerleader cute, almost 
a prettiness. Wide-set blue eyes 
he’d already noticed. Lips full and 
so nicely bowed that there was a 
little part in the middle, even with 
them closed. The face was, natural- 
ly, heartshaped; the hair blonde; 
and the blouse crowded. Her name 
had to be Jill, he thought. 

When she’d talked herself out, 
he asked her. 

“Nadine,” she said. “What’s so 
funny?” 

“Nothing. Well look, Nadine. I 
was in the process of raking up 
when you came down. So why don’t 



16 



IF 




you go back inside, and later — ” 
“No, no, I’ll kelp.” 

She was quite a circus. Not hav- 
ing the best sea legs in the world, 
she did a lot of grabbing and 
leaning — on her rake, the bulk- 
heads, Hatch himself — and even 
then managed one beautiful sprawl. 
But she got a kick out of the 
smells, though not digging the sala- 
manders which lived in the stuff. 

They’d been working twenty min- 
utes when Nadine met her first 
mossman. She was back near the 
work area, picking moss from the 
jungle of stays and antennae that 
made up Hatch’s communications 
masts. He was midships at the time, 
but her screech had no trouble 
making the trip. 

Nor did Hatch. Galloping back, 
he found her backed up against 
the deckhouse, waving her rake at 
the Jane. The loudspeaker was still 
on, and now that Handy’s sled had 
left, they were filtering back 
toward the barge. This was the first 
to climb in over the rail, however. 

Hatch laughed. “Relax, Nadine. 
Hey Jane — that’s right — over 
here.” With broad gestures he led 
her to the laying den. When she 
was out of sight behind the flap, 
Nadine said, “I need a drink.” 

They were standing right next to 
the still. Hatch offered her a cup 
and a warning. She took the cup 
but not the warning and got lifted 
off in two swallows. Hatch decided 
what the hell, he had as good a 



reason to blow his mind now as 
ever, and followed suit. 

They ended up sitting with their 
backs to the deckhouse, within an 
arm’s length of the spigot. 

He told her the one about the 
trisexual rigelian cabbage, and she 
responded with the limerick that 
began, “There once was a fruit-bat 
named Freddy.” Hatch told her she 
didn’t look the type for that kind 
of joke and she said oh yeah. 

The conversation drifted in a 
more serious direction. Whatever 
had gone on between himself and 
Handy? 

Hatch considered. The sun was 
where it belonged, the speed about 
right, the old T-belt steady off the 
beam. No need to check the auto- 
pilot. Hatch took a big swig, a deep 
breath, and began. 

Ill 

H e’d been a First Class Petty 
Officer. Rating: Transmuta- 
tion Technician. A T-tech’s work 
was the upgrading of stable ele- 
ments into fissionables by first gasi- 
fying the base metal and then ir- 
radiating the hell out of it. 

It sounded hairy to Nadine but 
Hatch said no, not really. The pro- 
cess wasn’t that complicated but re- 
quired two things: a base ore with 
both lead and actinium in it, and a 
whole lot of energy to pour into 
the beta beam. This planet had 
both, so GS had sent his old outfit 



BESIDE THE WALKING MOUNTAINS 



17 




down to exploit it. And yes, Handy 
was the C.O. 

There were several hundred men 
at first, to get the T-belt built. He 
waved toward the horizon where it 
floated on the moss like a string 
of gigantic silver sausages. Girding 
the entire planet, their thermoelec- 
tric skin produced energy from the 
hotside-coldside temperature differ- 
ential. Except for a central conduit, 
the sausages contained only a few 
gallons of sealant and a small pump 
to keep the boron-fibred, plastic 
skin inflated. 

In spite of its simplicity, the T- 
belt had been hard to build. Most 
of the materials had to be mined 
from the planet itself. Actually min- 
ing was hardly an appropriate word 
for the screwball operation they 
carried out. 

They started at the dawnline. 
Laser-drilling a vertical shaft in the 
moss, they quickly dropped in a 
crew and equipment. As the mine 
rotated out into the hotside, then, 
they had the thermal insulation of 
the moss itself. Oh, it helped; but 
temperatures approached one-sixty. 
Men had to wear suits. You can 
imagine how the T-crew envied the 
mossmen, whose tolerance made 
them comfortable right up to boil- 
ing water temperatures. Sometimes 
a mossman would show up with bits 
of charred vegetation in his fur, in- 
dicating he’d been as close to the 
surface as the flame area. 

Anyway, the heat was just part 



of it. The mine was actually a dust 
sifting operation — since the upper 
strata of the crust had been pul- 
verized by the galloping alps. 

Then, just after they’d got things 
going, seven months would be up 
and here came the mountains at the 
twiline. There was a mad scramble 
to get out in time, and more than 
once someone didn’t make it. 

Finally, since the mountains ob- 
literated their digs each half-rota- 
tion, it was necessary to go through 
the whole mess from scratch, each 
time. 

I n short, the project was almost 
impossible. But Handy never 
quit. Not when GS was currently 
putting four stripes on the sleeves 
of successful T-Group C.O.’s. The 
man was crazy. 

They both drank to that. 

But whatever the engineering 
problems might have been, Hatch’s 
planet was a natural scientist’s para- 
dise. Ever since man had broken 
free of the solar system, he’d been 
disappointed at how little life there 
was in the galaxy. Plants were rare, 
animals rarer, and intelligent beings 
— fellow citizens of the Galaxy — 
well, there were exactly two species. 
To find life in as inhospitable and 
bizarre a place as this had been 
quite a surprise. 

And what adaptations! The moss- 
men, for instance. They began as 
eggs laid at the twiline. When on- 
coming mountains engulfed both 

IE

parents and eggs, the parents died 
but one egg in a thousand lived 
through it. Because of the cold, 
the surviving eggs simply sat on 
the bottom as the planet made its 
ponderous, seven month half-turn. 
Then they were hit again, this time 
by the dawnline mountains. What 
few survived this onset usually 
hatched. All it took was two hours 
of dayside temperatures. 

They popped out of the shell as 
miniature adults, and started eating. 
Salamanders, mostly. And moss. 

They reached full size and ma- 
turity in less than a month. In- 
stinctively, they always moved 
against the motion of the planet, 
just as did Hatch’s hoverbarge. 
Their language was also instinctive, 
as was a strong social sense and a 
gentle mortality that was almost ori- 
ental. They were good, Hatch said. 

Nadine nodded. Hatch went on. 

Well, flesh and blood isn’t a 
hoverbarge, and sooner or later the 
mountains caught up with all of 
them. They got old and couldn’t 
keep up. Finally, they fell back to 
the twiline — where Hatch was 
right now — and spent their final 
weeks laying eggs on the bottom 
before the mountains got them. 

As they spoke, a procession of 
Janes had come aboard, left their 
clutch, and wandered past on their 
way to and from the still. They lay 
all about, sleeping off a fraction 
of what must be perpetual exhaus- 
tion. 

BESIDE THE WALKING MOUNTAINS 



Nadine pointed to one, asked 
how old she was and how much 
longer she could keep up. Hatch 
said, oh, maybe five years, with a 
month or two to go. About average. 

Nadine was visibly upset by this, 
so he hurried on with his story. 

Tt began when the construction 
-*• crew began putting mossmen to 
work in the mines. No, it wasn’t 
slave labor. The Joes actually liked 
being near the creatures that fas- 
cinated them so. And they liked 
learning things, such as what 
clothes were and how a wheel or a 
shovel worked. But the mines didn’t 
move against the planet. A lifespan 
which any normal mossman could 
stretch to six or seven years was 
chopped off in seven months. Handy 
got away with it because he hadn’t 
ever reported the mossmen’s exis- 
tence to home base. 

This, Hatch had decided right 
off, was a rotten thing to do to 
someone nearly as smart as your- 
self. He was among the minority of 
crewmen who regarded the mossmen 
as sub-humans rather than super- 
animals. And being the sort of man 
he was, he decided to do something 
about it. 

When he formed a committee and 
appealed to Commander Handy, he 
found himself in the brig. Handy 
hadn’t even spoken to them. When 
Hatch had finished his little speech, 
the Commander had simply nodded 
to the Master at Arms and gone on 

19 




sipping coffee and reading reports. 
Six days. 

TJ c got a month — and was bust- 

^ ed to Second Class — for 
writing his GS Rep. 

Then he was busted right down 
to SR for smuggling a spool back 
earthside to the newstapers. After 
that, Hatch got smart and went un- 
derground. He smuggled a smart old 
Joe into his section of the crew’s 
barge and began training him. A 
Personnelman buddy of his swiped 
an IQ test for aliens — which GS 
gave to determine how humanity 
would subsequently treat them. It 
was mostly non-participatory as 
such tests had to be, and it measur- 
ed reaction to various stimuli. Joe 
passed. The mossmen were legally 
intelligent and had full GS citizen- 
ship. 

So he’d sent the test earthside, 
to SPCA-E, and got the mossmen 
out of the mines and a hero’s status 
for himself. But Handy swore he’d 
kill him, just as soon as he faded 
from the limelight. For the mo- 
ment however, he couldn’t even put 
him in the brig. 

Then two things happened. For 
one, the T-belt was finished even 
without the mossmen’s help; and 
the galloping alps began to syste- 
matically wreck it, for another. Han- 
dy needed every T-Tech he had. 
Hatch was the best there was. His 
competence prevented the terminal 
accident his Commander had dream- 



ed of, over and over, late at night. 

Hatch almost felt secure again. 
The construction crew went home 
and only sixty men ran the T-belt 
and barges. Despite the continuing 
stream of repair work, their output 
of suburanic fuel was passable. It 
began to look like the station might 
be a success. 

“Until?” asked Nadine. 

Until the radioactive ash from the 
process began killing off the moss- 
men. Trouble was, the processing 
barges hovered right over the twi- 
line where the Janes laid their eggs, 
and sterilized a lot of them. The 
yield began to drop. 

So Hatch had stowed away in a 
supply ship, gone back to earth, 
and taken it to the SPCA-E. The 
T-belt was shut down. Handy re- 
mained a Commander. But Hatch 
was court martialled. If Handy 
could have gotten him in the brig, 
he’d have been a dead man. But 
all this happened at the Arctic 
Naval Base back on earth, so he 
was powerless. 

IV 

N adine had been listening so 
closely that she’d forgotten her 
cup. Hatch had been talking too 
much to bother with his, and they 
were both back down. 

“So you bought the place and 
moved in. Why?” 

Hatch eased her off his lap — 
a little embarrassed now — and 



20 



IF 




stood up. “Because a lot of irrepa- 
rable harm was done before I could 
stop Handy. The mossmen were 
cut down so far that they can’t 
maintain their number. They’re dy- 
ing out.” 

They went into the obs tower to 
eat. Hatch was talked out, brood- 
ing. Nadine rummaged through the 
mess of his food prep locker and 
put the semblance of a salad to- 
gether. They drank water. She let 
him take his time. 

“I guess you’ll want to start 
assessing things,” he said finally. 

“Forget it for now.” She came 
around behind his chair and put 
her hands on his shoulders. “Rich- 
ard J. Handy, Rat, GSN. He must 
have re-directed his entire career 
in the service to get the job he’s 
got now. To get you.” 

Hatch laughed. “But for all that, 
he got me. Public domain seems to 
be the biggest single hole in the 
bill of rights. In the final analysis, 
the majority has the power of life 
and death over the minority.” 

“And it’s not really applicable,” 
she said. “There’s no real fuel shor- 
tage.” 

“But what court is going to re- 
fuse the word of the President’s 
Advisor on that count? No, he’s got 
me.” 

Hatch checked his watch, got 
up, stretched, turned to her. “Day’s 
half shot, and I haven’t done a 
thing. Not that it’ll make much dif- 
ference now, but what the hell.” 



Nadine was surprised at how 
quickly she got used to the moss- 
men. She worked together with 
Hatch now, directing the Janes to 
the nests, placating the Joes, col- 
lecting the eggs when the nests 
were full. 

Hatch was sweating in the sun, 
half naked, walking among them. 
Patting, smiling, a continuous cha- 
rade of goodwill and congratula- 
tion. She saw him as an Indian, a 
latter-day noble savage, holding a 
dying tribe together for its own 
sake. 

Finally, he turned off the record- 
ings, and the newcomers diminished 
to a trickle. They, had only to 
transfer the eggs to the storage 
holds, Hatch said, and then wrap it 
up for the day. 

S he helped slide them down into 
four huge refrigerated holds. All 
four were nearly full. Thirty billion 
souls, he told her. Enough to re- 
populate the galaxy. 

“Why such a backlog?” she won- 
dered. 

Well, because only recently had 
he developed a method of ferrying 
them over the mountains. But he 
had it now and would probably 
stop collecting soon and concentrate 
full time on that phase of the oper- 
ation. 

“And how do you get them 
across?” she asked. 

“Would you like to see how it 
was done?” he answered. 



BESIDE THE WALKING MOUNTAINS 



21 




“Yes.” 

So when all the eggs were stored, 
he led her to what had been a life- 
boat locker, back near the stern. 
They had to pick away among the 
bodies of several hundred sleeping 
mossmen. 

Hatch went in and turned on 
the light. The small shed had been 
converted to a hangar. 

Eighty percent of the room was 
filled with boron plastic silk. Hatch 
poked at a control board near the 
door and the roof slid open. A com- 
pressor whistled to life and the 
jumbled fabric began to shape into 
a flabby cigar. 

When it tightened into a blimp, 
she could see that a nacelle had been 
at the bottom of the pile. It bore 
what seemed to her like much too 
big an engine, a laser, and a rudi- 
mentary bomb bay and doors. 

They loaded it with about ten 
thousand eggs. Hatch got the motor 
started, and cast off the cables. 
They watched it lurch up into the 
hot wind. 

“Come up to the bridge,” he said. 
“The radio control panel’s there.” 

Like everything else on the 
barge, Hatch’s RC equipment was 
a real kitchen job. He combined 
Ford’s ingenuity with Goldberg’s 
total lack of regard for symmetry. 
Amid the mechanoelectrochemiphy- 
sical mess of it all was a screen, 
and on that screen was the blimp. 
It was being swept rapidly astern 
toward the mountains. 



Hatch motioned her to sit beside 
him as he brought up power to the 
antenna, and then plunged into lip- 
biting concentration. It was as if 
they rode with it. 

He directed the thing by a dum- 
my stick and half a dozen toggles. 
The blimp began to pick up alti- 
tude, but slowly. He gave it more 
throttle and steeper flaps. She nosed 
up more quickly now. 

The mountains rolled ever closer 
in the background, and the violence 
of all that moving earth was a 
frightening thing. Nadine said she 
was glad she couldn’t hear it. 

It didn’t look at first as if they’d 
make it. The engine was a monster, 
but the wind was more monstrous. 
He cranked on full throttle, full 
flaps. The screen flashed black as 
the tracking radar went out of sync; 
and Hatch fumed to get the pic- 
ture back. When he did he heard 
Nadine gasp. 

Not a hundred feet separated 
the lurching limp from the hell- 
storm of dust and moss below it. 
But an inch would have been 
enough. Hatch let out his breath 
lftudly and smiled. 

T he nightside stretched out be- 
fore them like a burnt, black 
blanket. You could almost feel the 
cold. Hatch slowed to a hover. All 
around them the dust settled down 
through the moss, perpetuating the 
the same weird ecology it had since 
this particular world had begun. 



22 



IF 




He fired the laser, tunneling in- 
to the moss at a very shallow 
angle, perhaps ten degrees, and 
counted silently to himself, to 
twenty. They were quite low. The 
surface of the freezing moss lay 
only fifteen feet away. The hole 
was ten feet wide now. Hatch 
couldn’t miss. He dropped a thou- 
sand eggs, and they rolled on down 
the shaft. 

“Bravo,” Nadine said, and mi- 
micked one of the faces he made 
when congratulating the mossmen. 
He grinned. They repeated the pro- 
cess until the eggs were gone. 

He got back the altitude more 
easily coming back unladen, and 
they cleared the mountains by a 
thousand feet. In an hour the blimp 
was hissing out its helium in the 
hangar. 

They went down and tucked it 
in. He could see the girl was tiring, 
though she didn’t complain. It had 
been eight hours since she’d come 
down from Handy’s orbiting cruiser, 
and she’d been working most of 
them. His suggestion of a break 
drew a nod and quick imitation of 
a bear woofing and collapsing on the 
deck. 

“Do you always made faces?” he 
asked as they went up. 

“Yes.” 

Hatch cooked this time. In the 
midst of his typically misdirected 
pan rattling, Nadine commented 
that he was perhaps the worst or- 
ganized human she’d ever seen. 



Hatch chuckled but he was hurt. 
“I don’t know. Take what we did 
today. It’s pretty systematic, isn’t 
it?” 

“Yes, but we only did half the 
job. Too bad you can’t get them 
over the far twiline too,” she mused. 
“Though halfway around the 
world’s some blimp trip — ” 

“Right. And no gasbag would 
stay buoyant in that cold.” 

She sat up. “Still, I’ll bet there’s 
a better way. You could — ” But 
then she wilted and looked apolo- 
getically at Hatch. 

They ate, carrying on a glum but 
realistic conversation. When would 
Handy be back down for her? In a 
few hours. They discussed what 
various things were worth. Nadine 
made a few notes. Would he come 
back to earth with them? No, he’d 
stick around. Even with the T- 
belt running, there might be some- 
thing he could do for the mossmen. 
She suggested that Handy would 
probably kick him off as soon as 
the transaction was complete. 

Hatch shrugged. “Eminent do- 
main,” he sighed. “Majority be 
served, minority be damned.” 
Twenty-three seconds of silence. 
“Hatch?” She pointed down. 
“This barge.” 

Raised eyebrows. 

“Could it survive a run over the 
mountains?” 

“Never in a million years. Why?” 
“Well, suppose it could. Suppose 
you could carry all thirty billion 



BESIDE THE WALKING MOUNTAINS 



23 





eggs over the mountains, across the 
coldside, across the dawnline moun- 
tains — and lay them in the day- 
side. Thirty billion mossmen would 
hatch, right?” 

“I don’t dig.” 

“Majority. There aren’t that 
many other intelligent beings in the 
galaxy, don’t you see? Handy 
couldn’t invoke public domain.” 

y 

'T'he barge sidled closer to the T- 
belt. Nadine was nervous about 
handling the controls, but there was 
no other way. Hatch had spent the 
entire trip over explaining them to 
her. The ship handled like a pig, 
and he impressed this on her. 



Course corrections came with agoni- 
zing slowness. 

From this distance the T-cells 
loomed like Enterprise-sized gray 
elephants, stumbling along trunk to 
tail. Nadine kept saying she felt 
she was going to get stepped on 
any minute. Hatch pinched the 
meagre fat of her waist reassuring- 
ly, and left the bridge. 

Down on deck, he prepared to 
board the T-belt. Just like the old 
days. He’d used some of the same 
procedures, too. Since both the wind 
and the roughness of the moss di- 
minished as you moved further 
away from the mountains, he’d 
driven them thirty miles out into 
the hotside. But if it was less stormy 
here, it was hotter. 



24 



IF 




The sun was orange, not red, 
and Hatch’s twiline-oriented pu- 
pils had shrivelled to pinheads. He 
could barely see through the tears, 
or think through the headache. He 
had on a full complement of T- 
Tech gear too, from tool suit to 
back pack, and the unaccustomed 
weight smothered him. 

He waited as Nadine piloted 
them in. He wished they could skip 
this whole operation, but he knew 
that the barge wouldn’t have 
enough power for the trip up the 
mountains, not by herself. So he was 
forced to run a power cable to the 
T-belt. They’d make the run like 
an electric toy at the end of a cord. 

He stood by the line gun, arm up- 
raised, one eye on the bridge, an- 
other on the approaching gray T- 
cells. She angled them in ever closer. 
Now they were actually beneath 
the great rising curve of one of 
them. He dropped his arm, and saw 
the barge straighten out to parallel 
the chain. They were really too far 
out, but he was being conservative 
on her account. Go too far in, and 
a chance swell could lift the barge 
up against the T-cells and crush 
them. 

He waited until they’d drifted up 
to the junction between two cells, 
then told her to cut forward mo- 
tion. They’d have about an hour be- 
fore the mountains overtook them. 
He aimed the line gun, made the 
shot, and put on the climbing har- 
ness. 



The line ascended at about thirty 
degrees to the joint linking two of 
the huge sausages. It was a tough 
climb, even for him. He was sweat- 
ing so much that his hands slipped, 
even with gloves. Twice he lost hold 
and dangled heavily from the safety 
harness. 

TTe made it. Sitting on the two- 
* * foot central cable, he wiped his 
eyes, caught his breath. Down on 
the barge, Nadine waved encourage- 
ment from the bridge. 

The junction box was scarcely 
more than a black boulder of corro- 
sion. It took twenty minutes of 
torching and chipping to get the 
thing open. 

There were four hundred termi- 
nals in a twenty by twenty array 
Half were positive, half negative. 
Most were dead. Six years of disre- 
pair. He ran through seventy-three 
of the plusses before hitting one 
that was live. He kept on going, 
getting one more as an alternate if 
he needed it. 

Then he went through the 
minuses, ^nd got three. After bolt- 
ing in the cables, he fused the in- 
sulation and shut the box. 

Getting back down was easier, be- 
cause down is easier than up in the 
first place — and because half an 
hour had passed. They’d drifted 
back toward the mountains and 
things were cooler and dimmer. 

And rougher. The moss was 
breaking in over the bow in dark 



BESIDE THE WALKING MOUNTAINS

streams as he touched down, and 
the wind turned each tendril into a 
whiplash. He was glad for the tech- 
suit. They were drifting closer into 
the belt, too. He sprinted up to 
the bridge. 

As he burst in, Nadine wailed, 
“It won’t go — J ” 

“Yes, it will.” He took the stick. 

“Your face is bleeding.” 

“You’re crying.” 

“I’m scared.” 

So was he. The barge yawed 
violently, and the bow rose within 
yards of the cell above. He crabbed 
the rotors like mad, lifted the port- 
side apron, and prayed nothing 
would blow. 

They got out. The moss was just 
as rough, but with the T-belt a 
thousand yards away, they wouldn’t 
get mashed. He gave her back the 
controls. 

This time the deck was murder. 
They’d fallen back to the foothills. 
He’d put on a helmet, but the wind- 
driven moss howled up under the 
faceplate, into his sleeves, up his 
cuffs. He was getting high from 
the scent too, which didn’t help. 
He waded back to the blimp han- 
gar. 

Inflating the thing in a gale like 
this was something he decided he 
would never do again. The blimp 
finally bobbed a hundred yards be- 
hind and above on her tether cable. 
But he had to do it again, to the 
auxiliary blimp on the starboard 
side. 

26 



|TTe staggered back up to the 
“ bridge, a tight hand on the life- 
line all the way. Inside, he nearly 
collapsed. 

She gave him water and thirty 
seconds of attention, like a prize- 
fighter’s trainer between rounds. He 
got up, walked to the transplas wall, 
looked back aft. 

The blimps shuddered on their 
tethers like fishing bobs dragged by 
a demented muskie. But they had 
the desired effect, that of weather- 
vanes. They dragged the stem of 
the barge around and aligned it 
with the wind. With the wind and 
straight up the mountains — back- 
wards. At least they wouldn’t have 
to worry about holding a heading 
with the barge’s rudders. 

There was one final job, and 
barely time to do it. Hatch had to 
unreel as much power cable as he 
could, to allow them to get as far 
as possible from the T-belt, as it 
stampeded over the mountains. The 
mountains. Here they came. It look- 
ed like the whole world was rearing 
back to stomp them. Hatch put the 
helmet back on. 

He was back down on deck now. 
Not only moss but dust fouled the 
air now. And an occasional dark 
shape that went thump. The whole 
barge shuddered. The wind must 
have been sixty knots. The roar of 
it was deafening. A lot of the top- 
side gear had been carried away. 
There was the rising howl of more 
moss getting chewed in the rotors. 

IF 




Hatch made his way to where 
the cable over to the T-belt arced 
off into the portside darkness. Ten- 
sion in the cable told him his con- 
nections were intact. He opened the 
shorepower junction box which was 
set into the deck, and connected the 
T-belt’s cable to the spools inside 
it. 

Under the box was a hatch. He 
went belowdecks. Belowdecks in a 
hoverbarge is a shallow crawl space 
full of things that make noise. He 
loaded the reels with every last 
foot of conduit on the barge, and 
pulled out the pins. They sang free. 
Then he climbed out again, and for 
the last time, returned to Nadine. 

They didn’t say anything. No 
point; you just couldn’t hear. 
Hatch piloted them as far from the 
T-belt as the cable reels would al- 
low. Now, to cut it in. He flashed 
her a grin, held up crossed fingers, 
and threw four switches. Sixty 
thousand extra kilowatts from the 
T-belt poured into the support ro- 
tors and tried to make a helicopter 
out of a hoverbarge. 

Tt was a typical, Hatch-style 
* kitchen job in that it worked — 
barely. She’d surge ponderously up 
to the full height of her aprons, and 
kept on going for five or six feet. 
While up in the air her pitching and 
rolling ceased, but she tended to 
rise high at the bow, reversing the 
slope of the deck. 

Then she’d fall back slowly, 
BESIDE THE WALKING MOUNTAINS 



plunging the apron into the moss 
until - the cushion built up again. 
While in the moss all kinds of horri- 
ble noises issued from the rotors as 
they hacked into — everything. 
Heavy moss with treetrunk tendrils, 
cast up from the lower strata; dust 
and gravel from the bottom; and, 
most horrifyingly — mossmen and 
other fauna. 

It was like being in an elevator 
on a starship during warp-out. No 
human gut can take it. Nadine got 
sick; Hatch got sick. Nadine col- 
lapsed, but Hatch wedged himself 
erect and did what little he could 
to control the ship. 

They rolled giddily up the moun- 
tain wave. The incline increased. 
They spent less and less time in the 
air and more and more in the rub- 
ble, which was killing for the rotors. 
There was no more power, nothing 
he could do. 

Up ahead he saw the T-belt go 
booming over the crest, link by 
link. One burst even as he watched, 
and the thunderclap it made could 
be felt as well as heard. 

Now there was nothing he could 
see. Dust obscured everything. It 
filtered in through a defective vent. 
It stank of earth and burning moss 
and burning hair. As if the planet 
was compensating for its fragrance 
at the twiline. 

Hatch found himself standing on 
nothing. The deck dropped out, 
came back, dropped out again. 
They’d lost one of the blimps and 

27 




now crabbed up the mountain at a 
weird angle, whipsawing back and 
forth on the single tether. 

He felt it first, then heard it. 
One of the four support rotors had 
sheared. The drive motor wound up 
to an astronomical speed. He tried 
to get to the console, but somebody 
kept shaking the world. He felt 
like an ant in a matchbox. He 
heard the motor blow, and gave up 
trying to do anything but hang on. 
Nadine slammed against him on her 
way to the ceiling. He grabbed her. 

The transplas shield blew in. 
Hatch blacked out. 

VI 

T Te woke up, cold, in six inches 
of fine dust, under two feet of 
moss. Nadine was shaking him. 

“Thank God,” she said. 

One collarbone, an ankle — 
though that still worked — and a 
mild concussion for her. A hole in 
the head for him, some ribs, and a 
back. 

As for the barge: one blimp, one 
rotor, and everything that wasn’t 
welded to the deck. He looked out 
on a barren metalsquare, punctu- 
ated only by the major tanks and 
houses. The outside temperature 
was sixteen degrees and falling. 
They were a hundred miles into the 
coldside. 

Item: turn around, get back closer 
to the mountains, and get warm. 
Two hours. 



Item: repairs, human and other- 
wise. Twenty-four hours. 

Item: check supplies, power 

connections to the T-belt, environ- 
mental units and so on. Prepare to 
dive. Ten hours. 

Item: Dive: The first thing need- 
ed here was a hole to dive into. 
They ran up the blimp and tried to 
burn a shallow angle tunnel not far 
from the barge. But the moss, re- 
cently uprooted by the mountains, 
was like water. It wouldn’t hold a 
tunnel for six feet before caving 
in. 

So they had to run farther into 
the coldside, where the moss was 
frozen solid. The shaft was sunk 
within a few hundred yards of the 
T-belt, so that they could bury 
themselves as deeply as possible and 
still keep the power cable connected. 
They’d need it for the heaters. 

Their passage down the long, 
shallow tunnel was uneventful, ex- 
cept that Nadine got claustrophobia 
from the closeness of the reedy 
walls. 

When they reached the end of 
the power cable, they were about a 
mile down. Hatch wished it was 
deeper. But while the cold of the 
surface might get more quickly to 
them, they would at least have 
power to combat it. 

He scoured out a flat-floored ca- 
vern with the laser, put the barge 
in the middle, and — for the first 
time in six years — shut her down 
completely. 



28 



IF 




They stood there on the bridge 
with the self-absorbed smiles of 
people straining to hear distant 
music. First the main rotors 
stopped. Not that they were loud, 
but they’d been constant. And when 
Hatch stopped the auxiliaries, his 
ears almost hurt. He was aware of 
Nadine’s breathing. 

Finally, the hissing of air from 
the support apron — accompanied 
by the slow sinking of the barge 
right down to its frame — stopped. 
Even his own breathing seemed loud 
then. 

“Hatch,” she boomed. “Isn’t this 
weird?” 

'^phey grew used to it in the 
months that followed, and to 



each other. There were no problems, 
and nothing to do except turn up 
the heat every few days to com- 
pensate for their distance into the 
nightside. They ate, played cards, 
slept, talked, made love, and grew 
pale from lack of sun. Hatch some- 
times took a torch and walked 
around out on the deck for exer- 
cise, but soon it grew too cold for 
that. 

Soon, in fact, they were forced 
to block off all but the most essen- 
tial compartments of the barge to 
keep the heat. The outside tempera- 
ture fell to sixty below. Hatch 
guessed it to be more like a minus 
one hundred-ten on the surface. 

Finally, the point was reached 
when they were living on the bridge 





and in the obs tower — and drawing 
every watt their T-belt cable could 
put out. Yet still the temperature 
fell. The hoverbarge had never been 
meant for this; its insulation was 
nowhere near thick enough. Hatch 
was barely able to keep their living 
quarters above freezing. 

And then he wasn’t able. The 
morning she woke and found both 
the taps frozen, Nadine got scared. 

When they were forced to stay in 
bed all the time, even Hatch got 
scared. They’d been under six 
months. As a last ditch effort; he 
started up the barge’s auxiliary pile, 
to augment what they got from the 
T-belt. They celebrated by dancing 
barefoot on the warm metal deck. 

But it might well have been a 
funeral dance, and they knew it. 
They started saying dramatic 
things to each other. Last words, 
I love you, if I had it all to do 
over, and so on. It was in the midst 
of one such maudlin tirade that 
Hatch noticed the red blade of the 
recording thermometer was above 
the black blade. They’d made it. 

When the barge crept up from 
the tunnel, when the sunlight pour- 
ed over the shoulder of the moun- 
tains ahead of them, Nadine cried. 
Hatch was surprised; she’d never 
broken before, not during the worst 
of it. 

Crossing the mountains was in- 
finitely easier this time. Because the 
moss was frozen solid, it cushioned 
the heaving planet underneath. It 

30 



was like riding a glacier as opposed 
to their previous salmon-run, up- 
stream, through the rapids. 

Not that glaciers don’t roar and 
crack; there were a few tense mo- 
ments. Actually, they went up on a 
glacier and came down the other 
side on a smallish iceberg. 

But they came down intact, to 
the dawnline of the dayside, with 
thirty billion eggs. 

'T'hey sowed the eggs. They had 
^ more than enough time before 
Handy found them. The GS sled 
descended with unwonted speed. 
They watched it fall toward them. 

The cablepod disgorged McIntyre 
on the first trip, whose immediate 
comment was, “Gee, we thought you 
were dead.” 

Then came Handy, who said only, 
“Where have you been?” 

So they took him up to the obs 
tower, sat him down and told him. 

“So you came across the night- 
side. Why?” 

“I had a boatload of eggs, Com- 
mander.” 

“Mossmen’s eggs?” 

“Naturally.” 

“Hmp.” Handy looked thought- 
ful, cocked his head, sloshed his 
wineglass gently around and around. 
“So. I guess this was a last ditch 
stand to save the species before we 
open the T-belt, eh?” 

“Something like that.” 

“Do you think you’re succeed- 
ed?” 

IF 




“Sure. In fact, we’ll have some 
overpopulation for a while — des- 
pite the size of the planet — until 
the bears come down to accommo- 
date the available grazing area. Af- 
ter all, we increased birth expec- 
tancy from, oh, roughly less than a 
millionth of a percent — ” 

“To?” 

“Over ninety.” 

“So?” 

“Tell him, McIntyre.” 

“Sir?” asked the flustered sailor, 
looking at Hatch. 

“That public domain thing. Read 
it.” 

Questioning spaniel gaze shifting 
to the Commander, met with an ir- 
ritated nod. 

McIntyre hopped erect and be- 
gan to recite. “Eminent domain 
is — ” He looked like a freckled 
sixth grader. “Eminent domain is 
the superior dominion of the sove- 
reign power over property within 
the state, which authorizes it to ap- 
propriate all or any part therof 



to a necessary public use, reasonably 
compensation being made.” 

The sailor sat down. 

“Now, Commander, what’s thy 
sovereign power? The majority, 
right? And what’s the galactic pop- 
ulation right now?” 

Handy looked briefly thoughtfuL 
“Twenty seven-six or so. But — ” 
“Wrong. Fifty seven-six, thirty 
of which are mossmen. So you’re 
outvoted.” As Handy reached an- 
grily for his hat, Hatch lifted a 
restraining hand. “Wait now — 
don’t leave yet. I assume that while 
we were gone you’ve been working 
on the belt?” 

“Yes.” 

“And you’ve brought down barges 
and everything?” 

“Yes, damn it.” 

“Good. We’re going to open up 
a school for the mossmen, and we’ll 
need facilities. When you go — 
any time in the next ten hours — 
leave the barges.” END

"Our race is greater than yours . 
You can serve in only one way 
— die, and let us succeed you/ " 



44T TTe are there; we are correct. 

Y Y The computations were 
perfect. That is the place below.” 
“You are a worm,” 17 said to 
her companion 35, who resembled 
her every way other than in num- 
ber. “That is the place. But nine 
years too early. Look at the meter.” 
“I am a worm. I shall free you 
of the burden of my useless pres- 
ence.” 35 removed her knife from 
the scabbard and tested the edge, 
which proved to be exceedingly 
sharp. She placed it against the 
white wattled width of her neck and 
prepared to cut her throat. 

“Not now,” 17 hissed. “We are 



shorthanded already, and your 
corpse would be valueless to this 
expedition. Get us to the correct 
time at once. Our power is limited, 
you may remember.” 

“It shall be done as you com- 
mand,” 35 said as she slithered to 
the bank of controls. 44 ignored the 
talk, keeping her multicell eyes 
focused on the power control bank, 
with her spatulate fingers in re- 
sponse to the manifold dials. 

“That is it,” 17 announced, rasp- 
ing her hands together with pleas- 
ure. “The correct time, the correct 
place. We must descend and make 
our destiny. Give praise to the Saur 



32 



of All who rules the destinies of 
all” 

“Praise Saur,” her two compan- 
ions muttered, all of their attention 
on the controls. 

Straight down from the blue sky 
the globular vehicle fell. It was 
round and featureless, save for the 
large rectangular port, on the bot- 
tom now, and made of some sort 
of blue metal, perhaps anodized 
aluminum, though it looked harder. 
It had no visible means of flight 
or support, yet it fell at a steady 
and controlled rate. Slower and 
slower it moved until it dropped 
from sight behind the ridge at the 
northern end of Johnson ’s Lake, 
just at the edge of the tall pine 
grove. There were fields nearby, 
with cows, who did not appear at 
all disturbed by the visitor. No 
human being was in sight to view 
the landing. A path cut in from the 
lake here, a scuffed dirt trail that 
went to the highway. 

A n oriole sat on a bush and war- 
bled sweetly: a small rabbit 
hopped from the field to nibble a 
stem of grass. This bucolic and 
peaceful scene was interrupted by 
the scuff of feet down the trail and 
monotone whistling. The bird flew 
away, a touch of soundless color, 
while the rabbit disappeared into 
the hedge. A boy came over the 
shore. He wore ordinary boy clothes 
and carried a school bag in one 
hand, a small and Homemade cage 



of wire screen in the other. M the 
cage was a small lizard which clung 
to the screen, its eyes rolling in 
what presumably was fear. The 
boy, whistling shrilly, trudged along 
the path and into the shade of the 
pine grove. 

“Boy,” a high pitched and tre- 
mulous voice called out. “Can you 
hear me, boy?” 

“I certainly can,” the boy said, 
stopping and looking around for 
the unseen speaker. “Where are 
you?” 

“I am by your side, but I am 
invisible. I am your fairy god- 
mother — ” 

The boy made a rude sound by 
sticking out his tongue and blowing 
across it while it vibrated. “I don’t 
believe in invisibility or fairy god- 
mothers. Come out of those woods, 
whoever you are.” 

“All boys believe in fairy god- 
mothers,” the voice said, but a 
worried tone edged the words now. 
“I know all kinds of secrets. I know 
your name is Don and — ” 
“Everyone knows my name is 
Don, and no one believes any more 
in fairies. Boys now believe in rock- 
ets, submarines and atomic energy.” 
“Would you believe space 
travel?” 

“I would.” 

Slightly relieved, the voice came 
on stronger and deeper. “I did not 
wish to frighten you, but I am real- 
ly from Mars and have just landed.” 
Don made the rude noise again. 



PRAISEWORTHY SAUR

“Mars has no atmosphere and no 
observable forms of life. Now come 
out of there and stop playing 
games.” 

After a long silence the voice 
said, “Would you consider time 
travel?” 

“I could. Are you going to tell 
me that you are from the future?” 
With relief: “Yes I am.” 
“Then come out where I can see 
you.” 

“There are some things, that the 
human eye should not look upon.” 
“Horseapples! The human eye is 
okay for looking at anything you 
want to name. You come out of 
there so I can see who you are — 
or Pm leaving.” 

C4Tt is not advisable.” The voice 
-*■ was exasperated. “I can prove 
I am a temporal traveler by telling 
you the answers to tomorrow’s 
mathematics test. Wouldn’t that be 
nice? Number one, 1.76. Number 
two — ” 

“I don’t like to cheat, and even 
if I did you can’t cheat on the new 
math. Either you know it or you 
fail it. I’m going to count to ten, 
then go.” 

“No, you cannot! I must ask you 
a favor. Release that common liz- 
ard you have trapped and I will 
give you three wishes — I mean 
answer three questions.” 

“Why should I let it go?” 

“Is that the first of your ques- 
tions?” 



“No. I want to know what’s go- 
ing on before I do anything. This 
lizard is special. I never saw an- 
other one like it around here.” 
“You are right. It is an Old 
World acrodont lizard of the order 
Rhiptoglossa, commonly called a 
chameleon.” 

“It is!” Don was really interest- 
ed now. He squatted in the path 
and took a red-covered book from 
the school bag and laid it on the 
ground. He turned the cage until 
the lizard was on the bottom and 
placed it carefully on the book. 
“Will it really turn color?” 

“To an observable amount, yes. 
Now if you release her...” 

“How do you know it’s a her? 
The time traveler bit again?” 

“If you must know, yes. The 
creature was purchased from a pet 
store by one Jim Benan and is one 
of a pair. They were both released 
two days ago when Benan, deranged 
by the voluntary drinking of a 
liquid containing quantities of ethyl 
alcohol, sat on the cage. The other, 
unfortunately, died of his wounds, 
and this one alone survives. The 
release — ” 

“I think this whole thing is a 
joke and I’m going home now. Un- 
less you come out of there so I can 
see who you are 
“I warn you ...” 

“Good-by.” Don picked up the 
cage. “Hey, she turned sort of brick 
red!” 

“Do not leave. I will come forth.” 



IF 



34 




T^von looked on, with a great deal 
"■-^of interest, while the creature 
walked out from between the trees. 
It was purple in color, had large 
goggling eyes, was slightly scaley, 
wore a neatly cut brown jumpsuit 
and had a pack slung on its back. 
It was also only about seven inches 
tall. 

“You don’t much look like a man 
from the future,” Don said. “In 
fact you don’t look like a man at 
all. You’re too small.” 

“I might say that you are too 
big. Size is a matter of relevancy, 
And I am from the future, though 
I am not a man.” 

“That’s for sure. In fact you look 
a lot like a lizard.” In sudden in- 
spiration, Don looked back and 
forth at the traveler and at the cage. 
“In fact you look a good deal like 
this chameleon here. What’s the 
connection?” 

“That is not to be revealed. You 
will now do as I command or I will 
injure you gravely.” 17 turned and 
waved towards the woods. “35, this 
is an order. Appear and destroy 
that growth over there.” 

Don looked on with increasing 
interest as the blue basketball 
of metal drifted into sight from 
under the trees. A circular disk 
slipped away on one side and a 
gleaming nozzle, not unlike the hose 
nozzle on a toy firetruck, appeared 
through the opening. It pointed 
toward a hedge a good thirty feet 
away. A shrill whining began from 



the depths of the sphere, rising in 
pitch until it was almost inaudible. 
Then, suddenly, a thin line of light 
spat out towards the shrub which 
crackled and instantly burst into 
flame. Within a second it was a 
blackened skeleton. 

“The device is called a roxidizer 
and is deadly,” 17 said. “Release 
the chameleon at once.” 

Don scowled. “All right. Who 
wants the old lizard anyway?” He 
put the cage on the ground and 
started to open the cover. Then he 
stopped — and sniffed. Picking up 
the cage again he started across the 
grass towards the blackened bush. 

“Come backl” 17 screeched. “We 
will fire if you go another step.” 

Don ignored the lizardoid, which 
was now dancing up and down in an 
agony of frustration, and ran to the 
bush. He put his hand out — and 
apparently right through the char- 
red stems. 

“I thought something was fishy,” 
he said. “All that burning and 
everything just upwind of me — 
and I couldn’t smell a thing.” He 
turned to look at the time traveler 
who was slumped in gloomy si- 
lence. “It’s just a projected image 
of some kind, isn’t it? Some kind 
of three-dimensional movie.” He 
stopped in sudden thought, then 
walked over to the still hovering 
temporal transporter. When he 
poked at it with his finger he ap- 
parently pushed his hand right 
into it.

“And this thing isn’t here either. 
Are you?” 

“There is no need to experiment. 
I, and our ship, are present only as 
what might be called temporal 
echoes. Matter cannot be moved 
through time, that is an impossibil- 
ity, but the concept of matter can 
be temporaly projected. I am sure 
that this is too technical for 
you ...” 

“You’re doing great so far. Carry 
on.” 

“Our projections are here in a 
real sense to us, though we can 
only be an image or a sound wave 
to any observers in the time we 
visit. Immense amounts of energy 
are required and almost the total 
resources of our civilization are in- 
volved in this time transfer.” 

“Why? And the truth for a 
change. No more fairy godmother 
and that kind of malarky.” 

“I regreat the necessity to use 
subterfuge, but the secret is too 
important to reveal casually with- 
out attempting other means of per- 
suasion.” 

“Now we get to the real story.” 
Don sat down and crossed his legs 
comfortably. “Give.” 

TX7e need your aid, or our very 
* * society is threatened. Very re- 
cently — on our time scale — 
strange disturbances were detected 
by our instruments. Ours is a sim- 
ple saurian existence, some million 
or so years in the future, and our 



race is dominant. Yours has long 
since vanished in a manner too hor- 
rible to mention to your young ears. 
Something is threatening our entire 
race. Research quickly uncovered 
the fact that we are about to be 
overwhelmed by a probability wave 
and wiped out, a great wave of 
negation sweeping towards us from 
our remote past.” 

“You wouldn’t mind tipping me 
off to what a probability wave is, 
would you?” 

“I will take an example from 
your own literature. If your grand- 
father had died without marrying, 
you would not have been born 
and would not now exist.” 

“But I do.” 

“The matter is debatable in the 
greater plan of the universe, but 
we shah not discuss that now. Our 
power is limited. To put the affair 
simply, we traced our ancestral 
lines back through a! the various 
mutations and changes until we 
found the individual proto-lizard 
from which our line sprung.” 

“Let me guess.” Don pointed at 
the cage. “This is the one?” 

“She is.” 17 spoke in solemn 
tones as befitted the moment. “Just 
as somewhen, somewhere there is 
a proto-tarsier from which your race 
sprung, so is there this temporal 
mother of ours. She wil bear young 
soon, and they will breed and grow 
in this pleasant valley. The rocks 
near the lake have an appreciable 
amount of radioactivity which will

IF 




cause mutations. The centuries will 
roll by and, one day, our race will 
reach its heights of glory. 

“But not if you don’t open that 
cage.” 

Don rested his chin on fist and 
thought. “You’re not putting me on 
any more? This is the truth?” 

17 drew herself up and waved 
both arms — or front legs — over 
her head. “By the Saur of All, I 
promise,” she intoned. “By the 
stars eternal, the seasons vernal, 
the clouds, the sky, the matriarchal 
I . ” 

“Just cross your heart and hope 
to die, that will be good enough for 
me.” 

The lizardoid moved its eyes in 
concentric circles and performed 
this ritual. 

“Okay then, I’m as soft-hearted 
as the next guy when it comes to 
wiping out whole races.” 

Don unbent the piece of wire that 
sealed the cage and opened the 
top. The chameleon rolled one eye 
up at him and looked at the open- 
ing with the other. 17 watched in 
awed silence and the time vehicle 
bobbed closer. 

“Get going,” Don said, and shook 
the lizard out into the grass. 

nphis time the chameleon took 
the hint and scuttled away 
among the bushes, vanishing from 
sight. 

“That takes care of the future,” 



Don said. “Or the past, from your 
point of view.” 

17 and the time machine van- 
ished silently. Don was alone again 
on the path. 

“Well, you could of at least said 
thanks before taking off like that! 
People have more manners than 
lizards any day. I’ll tell you that.” 

He picked up the now empty cage 
and his school bag and started for 
home. 

He had not heard the quick 
rustle in the bushes, nor did he see 
the prowling tomcat with the limp 
chameleon in its jaws. END

usual little Nehru jacket which But I think he was suggesting to

me that I write everything out, just 
as it occurred, and I’m going to try. 
Even if I can’t use my hands, I may 
be able to type with my nose — it 
could even help me to make scents 
that way. 

I don’t really care much for typ- 
ing, anyhow. As a wise old editor 
once told me, “You can always spot 
a drunken science-fiction author. 
The only part of the typewriter he 
likes is the space bar.” 

But I digress. 

And the time has come to gress 
— about the Baycon, the 26th 
World Science Fiction Convention, 
held in Berkeley, California, from 
August 29th through September 
2nd, 1968. 

It really took place, you know. 
That’s why I’m wearing this jacket. 
And in order to comprehend what 
happened, perhaps I’d better sketch 
in a brief background. 

T^our score and seven years ago 
-*■ “that’s 1939, according to my 
arithmetic” the first World Science 
Fiction Convention was perpetrated, 
in New York. Some two hundred 
odd — if that’s the term I’m look- 
ing for — science-fiction fans 
writers, editors, artists and pub- 
lishers gathered together in a meet- 
ing-hall to listen to speeches and 
panel discussions on science fiction. 
There was much socializing, even 
more antisocializing, and a finale 
in the form of a lavish banquet, at 
$1 a head. Only 32 of the attendees 



could afford this expensive luxury 
in those faroff depression days, but 
the affair was voted a success. Since 
that time, with the exception of a 
hiatus during World War II, these 
Conventions have continued on an 
annual basis — and most of them 
have exceeded World War II in 
their impact. Each year, the affair 
has moved from city to city, spon- 
sored by a fan-group which bids 
for the privilege on a competitive 
basis. The winning masochists then 
undertake to put on a Convention, 
and these put-ons have occurred 
throughout the United States. Once 
a Convention was held in Toronto, 
and twice it took place in London, 
but always the concept has con- 
tinued to grow and expand. Now 
a Science Fiction Convention is a 
four-day affair, frequently attrac- 
ting upwards of a thousand guests, 
to say nothing of those it repels. 

Baycon co-chairmen Bill Donaho, 
Alva Rogers and J. Ben Stark, to- 
gether with their committee mem- 
bers, selected the Hotel Claremont 
for this year’s affair. The Claremont 
is a huge, rambling, old-fashioned 
place set against a picturesque hill- 
side background, which has often 
been recommended by opthamolo- 
gists as a site for sore eyes. 

But the attendance proved so 
large that guests were eventually 
scattered about in three other hotels 
in the Berkeley area, thus produc- 
ing a full-scale Berkeley riot. 

The rumble began on Thursday

as the fans assembled. Not just 
science-fiction fans, mind you, for 
seemingly the Convention is be- 
coming a convenient vehicle for 
other groups to hitch a ride on — 
a sort of surrey with the fringe-fans 
on top. 

There’s First Fandom, composed 
“or decomposed” of elderly types 
who entered fandom thirty or more 
years ago, led by such stalwarts as 
Bob Madle, Dave Kyle and Lou 
Tabakow. There’s the Burroughs 
Bibliophiles, spearheaded by such 
lovers of bibliofilth as Verne Cor- 
dell, Stan Vinson, Russ Manning 
and John Coleman Buroughs. They 
sponsored a special luncheon for 
their group and also put on a panel 
discussion which I attended. To my 
horror, I discovered they were not 
honoring William Burroughs, or 
even Abe, but some obscure char- 
acter named Edgar Rice Burroughs. 

Then there was a sizeable group 
of comic buffs, also on the program; 
devotees of science-fiction and mon- 
ster-film fans had their own session 
featuring Forrest J Ackerman, 
Bill Warren, and Eric Hoffman of 
the Count Dracula Society. Another 
large segment of attendees were 
dedicated fans of Star Trek; pro- 
ducer Gene Roddenberry addressed 
them at a session with remarks as 
pointed as Leonard Nimoy’s ears. 
The NFFF, the Order of St. Fanto- 
ny and other fannish groups partic- 
ipated in the proceedings. 

And just to complicate things 

AT BAY WITH THE BAYCON 



more, a considerable number of at- 
tendees were on hand merely to 
patronize the daily auctions — 
where original manuscripts, tele- 
plays, film stills, first editions, old 
magazines and original artwork sold 
to eager bidders, proceeds of this 
donated material being alloted to 
defray Convention costs. Chief 
Auctioneer Walt Daugherty knock- 
ed down one item for $160, an all- 
time record. This is somewhat more 
than he obtained when he auctioned 
off Harlan Ellison and myself to 
fans who sought exclusive inter- 
views. (That’s what my bidder got 
from me; what Harlan’s bidder got 
is one of those secrets Men Are 
Not Meant To Know) . 

At any rate — or, at least, at the 
rate this magazine is paying for the 
article — there was a lot more go- 
ing on at this Convention than just 
straight-line, old-fashioned science- 
fiction fanning. 

B y the time I arrived on Friday 
afternoon, there had already 
been a movie session, a fan revue, 
two official parties, eight unofficial 
parties, and nineteen feuds. The 
Convention was officially opened 
at noon, with keynote speeches by 
British writer John Brunner and 
American author Randall Garrett, 
together with rebuttals by various 
fans and pros. 

After I was conducted through 
the winding corridors to the spider- 
infested ruins of my room by the 



41 




bellboy (Dwight Frye) I wandered 
down to a Wine-Tasting Party to 
meet the authors. Here, for the 
first time, I encountered the leg- 
endary E. Hoffman Price — a re- 
nowned name when I was a boy, 
a personal friend of H. P. Lovecraft 
whom I’d had the pleasure of cor- 
responding with over thirty years 
ago, but had never met. He seemed 
every bit as much at home at this 
affair as Larry Niven, Joanna Russ 
or the other comparative newcomers 
to science-fiction circles. 

The next event, for authors at 
any rate, was the Science Fiction 
-Writers of America Banquet, at 
which I noted such notables as Jim 
Harmon, Miriam Allen deFord, 
Tom and Terri Pinckard, Sam 
Moskowitz, Ed Wood, Philip K. 
Dick, David Gerrold, Sam and 
Florence Russell. (I didn’t actually 
see all these people at the dinner, 
but it’s a sneaky way to drop a few 
names, and believe me there’s more 
name-dropping at a Convention 
than pigeon-dropping in Central 
Park). 

While Star Trek episodes played 
and the Order of St. Fantony con- 
ducted its esoteric rites, I wandered 
from private party to private party, 
encountering Guest of Honor Philip 
Jose Farmer, his wife Bette Jos<§ 
Farmer, Galaxy Gal Judy-Lynn 
Benjamin, and the charming couple 
responsible for the 1954 San Fran- 
cisco Convention, Les and Es Cole. 
Such fannish figures as Ruth Ber- 



man, Ed Meskys, Walt Leibscher, 
Leland Sapiro and last year’s Guest 
of Honor, the little-known Lester del 
Rey, were very much in evidence. 
But, unable to keep up with such 
inveterate swingers as Leigh Brack- 
ett, I retired at the respectable hour 
of 3 a.m. and fell into a deep, 
dreamless sleep which lasted all of 
twenty minutes. 

Saturday I inspected the Art 
Show, the Photo Exhibit, and the 
Book Room, where hucksters such 
as Don Day and Earl Kemp ped- 
dled books and magazines to col- 
lectors and unwary passersby. Then 
it was time to hear Ray Bradbury 
deliver his talk in the Convention 
hall. Ray really turned on. 

Immediately thereafter I found 
myself in exalted company, on the 
platform with a panel consisting of 
Edmond Hamilton, Emil Petaja, E. 
Hoffman Price, Jack Williamson 
and Alva Rogers, with Fritz Leiber 
sitting at my elbow to keep me in 
line. Fritz and Harlan Ellison later 
delivered a sensational reading of 
their works to the accompaniment 
of a psychedelic light show back- 
ground. Somewhere along the line 
I met up with Bjo Trimble and 
John, A1 Lewis, Poul and Karen 
Anderson, Wendayne Ackerman and 
a supper group consisting of the 
Kyles, publisher Bob Guinn, Carol 
Pohl and her lovely daughter, and 
her husband (whose name I can’t 
recall) . 

And then it was time for the 

IF 



42 




Masquerade Ball and Galaxy of 
Fashion — one of the top events of 
any Convention. That is to say, the 
Ball is one of the top events, and 
the Fashion Show is rapidly becom- 
ing topless. 

'Tphis particular Ball will be 
bouncing around as a topic of 
discussion for a very long while to 
come, for the Convention committee 
augmented it with the performances 
of three “name” rock bands and a 
light show by Great Northern. 

Those under 30, including a con- 
spicuous number of hippies, really 
were digging the mind-blowing 
sounds and the visual array of psy- 
chedelicatessen. But for those who 
don’t grok rock or like psych, the 
deal was an ordeal. And the 225 
costumed contestants for prizes 
were jammed into a narrow outer 
corridor during the three 45-minute 
decibel-shattering sessions between 
parades while the judges deliberated 
on their choices. Jack Chalker, 
Chuck Crayne and others respon- 
sible for staging this affair were 
vindicated when next year’s Con- 
vention-bid winners pledged a re- 
peat performance, but I predict 
that amongst the older generation 
who will attend, one of the most 
popular costumes will consist of a 
pair of dark glasses and a set of 
earplugs. 

Some of the costumes were im- 
aginative and outstanding; Bruce 
Pelz, Quinn Yarbro, Don Christman 



and Lin Carter were among the 
winners, and I can only apologize 
to those whose names I didn’t catch 
from Hal Clement and the other 
judges 1 was too busy talking to 
Evelyn del Rey. But no one present 
failed to be impressed by Walt 
Daugherty and Elaine Ellsworth, 
whose “Android Rejects” costumes 
and pantomime are probably the all- 
time standout presentation in my 
memory of masquerades. 

Then it was private party time 
again, but while such youngsters 
as Frank Dietz, Honey Wood and 
Barbara Silverberg reveled, I crept 
off to bed at the respectable hour of 
4 a.m. and didn’t wake up until 
almost 7. 

Breakfasting with Peg Campbell 
and her husband (John, isn’t it?) 
and Lester del Rey, I then wan- 
dered about through a maze con- 
sisting of Louis and Bebe Barron, 
Jo Ann Wood, Donald Wollheim, 
Roy Squires Lois Lavender, Paul 
Turner, Jean Bogert, George Price, 
Mary Alice, Arnie Katz, Dick and 
Pat Ellington, Joe and Roberta Gib- 
son, and a dozen others. For the 
benefit of completists, the dozen 
others consisted of the Goldstones, 
Sid Coleman, Ian and Betty Bal- 
lantine, Ross Rocklynne, the Bus- 
bys, Boyd Raeburn, Daniel Ga- 
louye, Dirce Archer and Vera 
Heminger, the No. 1 STAR 
TREK fan. I could also men- 
tion Len Moffat and Elmer 
Perdue, but that would throw me

off my count. And counting- time 
was about to begin. The Business 
Meeting took place, with Columbus 
and St. Louis competing for next 
year’s Convention. St. Louis won 
the bid, and Missouri pharmacists 
are already laying in an extra sup- 
ply of aspirin and tranquilizers. 

Messrs. Pohl, Campbell, Silver- 
berg and Spinrad were among the 
hardy souls who manned a panel 
discussion after Gene Rodden- 
berry’s talk; the auction went into 
action, and I drifted off to tape a 
radio program discussion with 
Fritz Leiber. When we emerged, it 
was precisely twenty minutes be- 
fore the start of the Banquet and 
we decided ?o drift down into the 
dining room. 

We drifted no further than the 
lobby — there encountering a wait- 
ing-line which extended from the 
dining-room doors all the way out 
into the parking lot. A staggering 
725 banquet guests (some of whom 
never stopped staggering through- 
out the entire Convention) were 
queued up for admission. If it 
hadn’t been for the kind offices of 
Norman Spinrad, I’d never have 
found a seat. But he saved me a 
place, and quicker than you can 
say Bug Jack Barron , I was escon- 
sed across the table from Terry 
and Carol Carr and several other 
people whose names were impos- 
sible to catch in the deafening din. 
The dining room at the Claremont 
is a maze of pillars, cleverly de- 



signed to block the view of the 
podium while at the same time 
trapping every whisper of sound, 
and I spent most of the time trying 
to outguess Norman Spinrad re- 
garding our banquet fare. 

Tt was I who predicted that as 
a sentimental gesture we would 
be served some of the peas left 
over from the first Convention 
Banquet in 1939. But it was Nor- 
man who anticipated the chicken, 
with the tell-tale tire-marks. True, 
I did tell him we’d also be served 
rice — but the only reason I knew 
it was because I’d noticed a wed- 
ding ceremony at the hotel earlier 
in the day. Neither of us guessed 
the dessert, which had been do- 
nated, apparently, by the property 
department of the old Dr. Kildare 
television series. 

But one doesn’t attend a Science 
Fiction Convention Banquet to eat; 
the meal is just a toughening-up 
process to insure a strong stomach 
for the program itself. 

Toastmaster Bob Silverberg took 
over in fine form as a series of 
awards were bestowed; the First 
Fandom Award to Jack William- 
son, the E.E. Evans “Big Heart” 
Award to Walt Daugherty, the 
Little Men’s “Invisible Man” 
Award to J. Francis McComas, and 
— at intervals — special Baycon 
Awards to Harlan Ellison, Gene 
Roddenberry and Silverberg. Ran- 
dall Garrett and wife Alison, in full

costume, performed a calypso-type 
ballad based on a Poul Anderson 
Novel. Fan Guest of Honor Walt 
Daugherty spoke warmly and nos- 
talgically of his years in science 
fiction. 

The Trans-Oceanic Fan Fund, 
which annually imports a foreign 
fan to an American Convention or 
sends an American fan to a foreign 
convention, had brought the illus- 
trious Takumi Shibano from Japan; 
he was introduced, honored for his 
fanactivity across the Pacific, while 
other foreign fans beamed up at 
him from the tables. 

Then the Guest of Honor, Philip 
Jose Farmer, took over the platform 
to a standing ovation. The ovation 
was repeated, and deservedly so, at 
the conclusion of his address — in 
which he pledged himself personal- 
ly to the principles of the “Triple 
Revolution” sociological concept 
and movement after an incisive 
analysis of the problems plaguing 
both science-fictional and actual 
society. 

Following came the “Hugo” 
Awards, presented by Harlan Elli- 
son. It was a great night for Harlan, 
who walked away with two trophies 
himself — Best Drama “City On 
The Edge of Forever” and Best 
Short Story “I Have No Mouth 
But 1 Must Scream ” Harlan, who 
first appeared at a Convention in 
1952, as science-fiction’s answer to 
Tiny Tim, has really risen to the 
heights, and such recognition may 



have to some extent compensated 
him for smashing up his car earlier 
in the course of his stay. 

Best Fanzine Award went to 
George Scithers, for Amra, a not- 
able publication which represents 
only one aspect of his fan-activity. 
George Barr took a trophy as Best 
Fan Artist, and Ted White received 
a Hugo as Best Fan Writer. 

Jack Gaughan won Best Pro 
Artist Award, to much acclaim; he 
will be Guest of Honor next year. 

The Hugo Award for Best Pro 
Magazine went to the publication 
you are now clutching in your hot 
little hands. It was presented to 
Frederik Pohl (the guy whose name 
I couldn’t remember) and accept- 
ed by publisher Robert M. Guinn. 
And it will probably end up as a 
doorstop for Judy-Lynn Benjamin. 

Best Novelette Award was be- 
stowed on Fritz Leiber for his 
Gonna Roll The Bones , and the 
Hugo for the Best Novella went to 
two winners: Anne McCaffrey for 
Weyr Search and Philip Jose 
Farmer for Riders Of The Purple 
Wage . The Best Novel Hugo was 
presented to Roger Zelazny, for 
Lord Of Light , After an SFWA 
Award was given to retiring presi- 
dent Bob Silverberg, the 725 guests 
arose from the five-hour-long ses- 
sion and made a mad stampede for 
the washrooms. 

I made a brief, five-hour token 
appearance at the Galaxy suite and 
then bedded down with the spiders. 



AT BAY WITH THE BAYCON

TX^hile the Tolkien Society of 
America convened the next 
morning, as is their hobbit, I 
breakfasted with Alan Nourse and 
his wife, then dashed off to visit 
with Richard Wade, who had 
“bought” me at the auction. Then 
I packed, looked in at the party 
which had just started in the 
Farmer’s suite, and made a chauf- 
feured dash for the airport in the 
company of Harry Harrison and 
his diminutive darling, Joan. 

My last backward glimpse 
showed the Convention still going 
on — a concert of medieval music 
on the greensward beyond the hotel, 
preliminary to a full-scale Medieval 
Tournament. What happened there 
I’ll never know; did Frank Robin- 
son demolish T. Bruce Yerke with 
a broadsword, did Sid Rogers clout 
Art Widner with a pikestaff, and 
did George Nims Raybin get clob- 
bered by Bill Rotsler’s mace? The 
mayhem continued until midnight, 
but by that time I was back home, 
safe in bed with my own spiders. 

Before drifting off to sleep, I 
spent a little time reflecting on 
Science Fiction Conventions, past 
and present, and soon began to 
dream of a Jew conclusions. 

Conventions, no doubt about it, 
are bigger than ever. But bigger is 
not necessarily synonymous with 
better. There are, perhaps, a few 
changes which might be made to 
improve procedure and faciliate 
festivity. 



For one thing, there’s the matter 
of the banquet. Admittedly the high 
spot of the Convention, it has now 
reached a length where additional 
Hugos may have to be awarded for 
bladder-control. Five hours is a long 
time to sit still under optimum 
conditions; not only for diners but 
for the dignitaries and indignan- 
taries on the podium. 

In the early days, the Guest of 
Honor delivered his address at a 
special session in the Convention 
hall — until, somewhere along the 
line, it was decided that if he spoke 
at the Banquet, more ticket sales 
would result. Then the Hugo 
Awards became a part of Conven- 
tion tradition, and this stretched 
the Banquet program to its present 
length. Inasmuch as Banquet at- 
tendance no longer constitutes a 
problem, I’m inclined to recom- 
mend that the old order be rein- 
stated. Let the Guest of Honor ap- 
pear for his talk before the entire 
Convention in the hall; it’s no 
“honor” to sit and wait for three 
and a half hours of dining and din 
before facing an already restless 
audience. 

Several years ago I put forth an- 
other suggestion, and I’d like to 
state it again. Now that Conven- 
tions have emerged from the small- 
scale attendance-problems of the 
depression years, there’s no reason 
why membership fees couldn’t be 
safely raised from $3 to $5 — and 
the additional sum turned over to 



46 



IF 




a professional convention-planning 
organization in whichever city is 
selected. The Committee would re- 
main in full charge and sponsor- 
ship, but the professional conven- 
tion-organizers would handle the 
increasingly difficult logistics — 
and deal firmly with hotels and 
suppliers to insure, under legal con- 
tract, that management promises 
are kept. When a thousand or more 
people gather together, some of 
them coming from great distances, 
at great personal expense, they de- 
serve the kind of treatment and the 
kind of facilities afforded to “mun- 
dane” convention-goers. And an 
amateur Committee, with the best 
will in the world, and the ultimate 
expenditure of time and effort, just 
cannot cope with the situations 
which inevitably arise — the ele- 
vators which don't arise, for exam- 
ple — the bellhops who don’t hop 



— the “24-hour-a-day” coffee-shop 
which closes due to lack of Labor 
Day help, or opens to serve thirty 
people out of thirteen hundred. 

None of this is meant to be a 
reflection on the Baycon Commit- 
tee or any previous or future Con- 
vention committee — and yet, un- 
til these matters are solved, it con- 
stitutes a reflection on all who 
strive so mightily to make these 
affairs a success. Perhaps this mat- 
ter is worth consideration at future 
business sessions. 

M eanwhile, the World Science 
Conventions go on — for fun, 
for fraternalization, for the enrich- 
ing, exciting moments they provide. 
There’s nothing else quite like them 
in this world — or out of it. 

And if I recuperate in time, I’m 
going back next year.

contribution and was from Barber’s 
home town. I’ve always felt that the 
last point carried the most weight. 

But he was the A.G., and I took 
the phone and listened to him bab- 
ble frenetically. He had been sitting 
there trying to figure how to put 
the screws to a labor leader — with- 



48 




out forfeiting the muon vote in the 
next election. Then he heard a little 
noise and smelled a funny smeH 
and looked up. The gentleman from 
Mars had arrived, sans secretarial 
announcement, sans knock. And he 
hadn’t come through the outer of- 
fice — there hadn’t been any 
shrieks. 

After a brief discussion, Hank 
called his boss. In the first place 
President Barber was busy trying 
to figure how to put the screws 
on a corporation without losing its 
President’s Club contribution. In 
the second place he was bugged at 
being interrupted by someone other 
than the military. He hung up. Ap- 
parently Hank tore his hair for a 
few hours and called good old me. 
Another Ohio boy. 

I resisted. Hank predicated the 
predictable. 

"Joe,” he pleaded, "your coun- 
try needs you, Joe.” 

I snorted at the telephone’s dol- 
orous voice. Hank resorted to a 
more basic appeal. 

"This is a great opportunity for 
you, Joe.” 

I thought about that. National 
headlines: Ohio Lawyer Saves 

World . That should parlay into a 
cabin and a boat on Lake Lumen, at 
least I sighed. 

" Green, huh?” 

"Green, Joe.” 

"Hm. What are the precedents? 
Whose system of jurisprudence pre- 
vails? Who calls and examines the 



jury? What color will they be?, 
What’s my fee?” 

He admitted ignorance; it was 
up to me. As to fee: "Joe, it’s your 
country you’re serving!” 

"I’ve noticed. The increase in so- 
cial security I paid for my secretary 
this year was higher than the penal- 
ty I was charged because my quar- 
terly tax estimate was low. Man, 
I’m serving!” I had made up my 
mind, in point of fact. But you 
don’t sum up your case in your 
opening address. Besides, I wanted 
to hear his final plea. 

T did. Internal Revenue, it seemed, 
was interested in my tax re- 
turns. They might even be inter- 
ested in them for the duration. 

"Jqst a minute, Hank,” I said 
with malicious mien. "I’ve got to 
change the tape on my telephone 
recorder.” 

That, please be assured, brought 
silence from the Attorney General. 
After a passage of time no doubt 
measurable in seconds but seeming 
to span hours, I could no longer 
keep a straight voice. I, in lay 
terms, busted out laughing. 

"Hank, I can’t be blackmailed 
with threats of the Secret Police. 
And I have never and will not now 
accept a case on the telephone. But 
I will agree to confer with prosecu- 
tion.” 

I waited, knowing he was calm- 
ing himself, wisely curbing a pro- 
fusion of appreciative noises and

taking a few deep breaths. "I am 
very pleased to hear that, counsel- 
lor,” he said, and I nearly broke up 
agaim. "Suppose we send a plane 
dowm for you.” 

"Suppose I catch one myself. 
I’d just spend the whole flight on 
your plane thinking what a helluva 
way this is to spend all the taxes 
Fve sent in the last five years. Be- 
sides, I’m in favor of private enter- 
prise. Make me a room reservation 
and have me met, please. I’ll wire 
my arrival time.” 

He agreed, and we parted, and I 
buzzed Miss Anderson. I told her 
I wanted a reservation on the first 
Washington-bound plane and asked 
her to send Turk in as soon as he 
showed up. Turk is my assistant. 
Able, willing, bright with book 
learning, fresh from passing the bar, 
and about as green as the Martian 
in Layton’s office. Then I called 
home. 

"What’s for supper?” 

"Hamburgers mit onions,” my 
wife Jodie said. "You’re not work- 
ing tonight, remember, and no 
meetings for a change. Oh, and John 
and Judy.” 

My favorite at-home meal and 
my favorite talkers! "Damn! That 
makes it even worse, but ... I’ll be 
a little late.” 

She sighed; you know the sound. 
But she’s well trained; we don’t 
watch TV comedies. "Thanks for 
calling, honey. How late?” 

"Ummm . maybe a few days, 



maybe a week. Can’t be sure. I 
seem to be going to Washington.” 
I watched Miss Anderson’s progress 
across my office — one of life’s 
little rewards — and conned a piece 
of paper she handed me. I nodded 
and winked at her. "I’m leaving at 
6:17,” I told the phone. 

Jodie, as I said, is well trained 
She also knows me. She didn’t say a 
word. My one true love knows when 
to make noises or wait silently, 
thereby forcing me to give her the 
straight nitty-gritty. I explained 
with brevity unbecoming a lawyer, 
and we said some sweet sad things, 
and she rang off to go do some 
packing for me. 

The plane was not a headline- 
grabber, and I was safely in Wash- 
ington a few hours later. Naturally 
the damned fools got me a suite. In 
Washington the only people who 
know how to be small are Internal 
Revenue. 

Within an hour of that I was 
meeting with my learned opponent, 
the eminent Martian attorney Lars 
Larkas. 

TT e was most definitely green, was 
^ ^ Lars Larkas. His hairless hu- 
manoid body was, in point of fact, 
a very handsome olive color. This 
made it considerably more palatable 
than had he been, for instance, char- 
treuse or bilious. He possessed the 
standard complement of two arms 
and two legs — but with a pair of 
intermediary limbs thrown in. Ob-

IF 




viously a Martian in the wres- 
tling-ring, or, if you’re female, on 
the livingroom couch or at a drive- 
in movie, would be Bad News. 

His eyes — two — were set at 
the sides of his head — one — and 
moved independently of each other, 
like those of an Earthly horse. The 
vertical slit of his, ah, nose and 
the nasty upcurving tusks resemble 
nothing I know of, aside from 
things I’ve seen in my own bed after 
several drinks and pizza with plenty 
of onions and garlic, topped off with 
pistachio ice cream. His big cupped 
ears stuck out like those of a cer- 
tain recently-deceased movie star or 
a certain recent president. 

The fact that his eyeballs were 
intensely white with irises of an 
equally intense red did not serve 
to put me wholly at ease with a 
visitor from a planet named after a 
war-god. My first impression of this 
first known visitor from space was 
one of inimicality. I hasten to add 
that I was wrong. He always looks 
that way. He can’t help it, poor fel- 
low; with big ears and red eyes and 
ferocious-looking tusks and a cou- 
ple of extra limbs, what are you 
going to do? 

I was introduced as an eminent 
attorney; so was Lars Larkas. 

"My pleasure, counsellor,” I said, 
with what I think was admirable 
aplomb. 

"The pleasure is mine, counsel- 
lor,” he said, in such perfect English 
that he blew my aplomb. His voice 



was startlingly soft, for his bulk; a 
delicate susurrus. He did not smile, 
I noticed. Thank Godl 
We got the preliminaries out of 
the way and agreed to sit; I am 
six-one and not accustomed to tilt- 
ing back my head in conversation, 
since I have never formed the habit 
of conversing with overpaid pitui- 
tary freaks called basketball play- 
ers. Seated, with several feet of 
carpet and free air between us to 
lessen the slope from the top of his 
head down to mine, I was consider- 
ably more at ease. The fact that he 
was far too big for his chair made 
him look even more imposing, and I 
made a mental note. 

"perhaps I should add for the li- 
bidinously curious that he 
wore a handsome one-piece jumper 
or tunic or something of charcoal 
gray with a dark red stripe bisecting 
it down the front. The insignia of 
a practitioner of law. I liked that I 
"You must stand high in the 
councils pf Earth, Counsellor Blair, 
to Kav6 been chosen to represent 
your nation and, generally speak- 
ing, your planet in this matter,” 
Lars Larkas said. 

"That’s something we should 
clear up,” I told him. "There is a 
matter of jurisdiction involved. 
There may be one or two countries 
on Earth so niggardly as to object 
to so momentous a matter resting 
in the hands of the United States. I 
realize you have been through this

before, but would you mind stating 
to me the exact nature of your 
business here, and the complaint 
of your planet? I blush to admit it, 
but we have not been aware of your 
existence. As a matter of fact we 
have proven quite conclusively that 
intelligent life does not and cannot 
exist on Mars” 

"Our philosophers have mention- 
ed the same conclusion,” Lars Lar- 
kas said, "as have yours.” And we 
had a nice polite laugh together. He 
looked shocked as I continued to 
smile. I tried it with my mouth 
closed. He seemed to prefer that. I 
made a mental note. After all, it is 
rather unusual that man is the only 
beast on this planet that bares its 
fangs in friendship ! Apparently the 
— to broaden the term’s applica- 
tion — men of the planet called 
Red do not. 

"I do not mind in the least, 
Counsellor Blair,” Counsellor Lars 
said. (Patronym comes first on 
Mars, as in China. We all have our 
little peccadillos, as the American 
driver said in England just before 
he was creamed all over Berkely 
Square.) "As background informa- 
tion, there is indeed life on Mars. 
We are older than you, although 
not tremenduously older. Our race 
was full-formed though barbaric 
when your race first descended from 
the trees.” 

"You know that for fact?” I 
could not help interjecting. "Our 
descent, I mean.” 



He looked astonished — I guess. 
"Of course. I state nothing positive- 
ly unless it is fact, Counsellor.” 

"Admirable in an attorney,” I 
observed. Sets us apart from legis- 
lators. At any rate, Mister Scopes 
will be very glad to hear of man’s 
origin, although a minister of my 
acquaintance will not. It’ll play hob 
with his radio show — please excuse 
me and please continue, Mister Lar- 
kas. Excuse me — Counsellor Lars.” 

T Te shrugged. "Of course. We for- 
^ * got that you are still wrestling 
with myth on this barbar — ” He 
broke off and cleared his throat, 
which I thought was damned con- 
siderate of him. "There is also in 
fact intelligent life on Venus and 
on two of Jupiter’s moons and, 
strangely, on Uranus, although the 
form it takes there would leave you 
breathless! It is rather more cold 
out there than on our worlds, and 
they are of course adapted to such 
a climate. Not to mention an impos- 
sibly abominable atmosphere.” And 
I swear unto you Mister Lars Lar- 
kas shivered. 

"We have a union; that’s as good 
a word as any. A concordat, rather 
like your United Nations, although 
ours is effective.” 

To the quick, I thought. Be sure 
to wipe off the blood when you pull 
out the blade, you Martian male - 
dictor! 

"Naturally the matter of Earth 
has been brought up repeatedly, 



52 



IF 




particularly in recent years. Your 
people are a bit more warlike than 
most, but human nevertheless and 
intelligent, and we feel you would 
make valuable members of the In- 
trasystem Union.” 

Be damned! He did not, please 
observe, say that we are backward! 
He did not claim to vast superior- 
ity! He did not say we’d have to be 
quarantined, or wiped out, or that 
we’d been voted down or any of 
that old stuff. It is nice to know 
after a great deal of propaganda 
to the contrary that one is human 
and intelligent and would make a 
valuable contribution to an inter- 
planetary alliance of Red-Eyed 
Monsters! (I stored that phrase 
away: REM’s!) 

"The matter has come to a vote 
and you have been accepted. How- 
ever a blackball was cast, and a 
point of law was raised. The vote 
was completed on a contingency 
basis. That is the purpose of my 
visit. My planet has sent me here 
to state its case, Counsellor Blair, 
and to endeavor to arrive at a set- 
tlement.” 

"Just a moment,” I said. "First, 
apparently you don’t find our air 
overrich in oxygen? The gravity 
does not prevent too great a strain 
on your muscles or internal struc- 
ture?” 

He nodded vigorously, thereby 
confusing me; I did not learn until 
a bit later that a nod on Mars in- 
dicates a negative. We will not dis- 



cuss their indication of a positive 
reaction or affirmative just now; 
not having been treated to the bless- 
ings of an antisexual religion, they 
are an astonishingly open and erot- 
ically frank people. Fortunately he 
said "Oh no” as he nodded, there- 
by giving me a clue. "I have had a 
series of inoculations and I take 
antoxygenates every six hours — 
Martian hours — and I am wearing 
a brace. I feel little discomfort. As 
a matter of fact, it certainly is easy 
to breathe here!” 

"Try New York,” I muttered. I 
had taken notice that he was as 
eager as I to get to know each oth- 
er, to be polite, to otherwise take a 
roundabout course toward our final 
business, after the statement of 
which we might be enemies forever. 
It’s the way things are done, you 
see. "You may be aware of our un- 
fortunate tendency to debilitate with 
such things as intoxicants and de- 
pressants and the like. May I ask 
if — ” 

He waved a hand. No, two. Both 
on the same side. "Please feel free 
to drink coffee, which I find de- 
lightful, or alcohol, which we also 
use, or tobacco. That, you realize, 
we cannot afford, inasmuch as our 
air is thin and our lungs more im- 
portant to us than yours to you.” 

T considered that from an empiri- 
cal standpoint as I extracted 
a dgaret from one vest pocket — 
oh yes, I wear them; we conserva-

fives need badges to distinguish us 
from the socialists. I found a book 
of matches in another. He watched 
with interest and, I believe, some- 
thing akin to horror. Or perhaps 
pity. I was careful with my smoke, 
which gave rise to a thought. I 
went to the bathroom and turned 
on the light. Uh-huh; at once the 
blower or rather sucker, the little 
ventilator thing most hotel bath- 
rooms, have came on. I left the door 
open and the light on and blew 
my smoke that way. It went wher- 
ever bathroom blowers blow their 
bathroomy essences. 

"This litigatory point existing be- 
tween our planets, then, is the only 
factor holding Earth back from an 
open-arms welcome in the Intre- 
system Union, is that it?” I re- 
alized we’d have to do this all over; 

I had no secretary and thought it 
impolite and impolitic to switch on 
my recorder. I filled the tape later, 
and we later made an agreement 
to tape our conversations, too. 

"Precisely that, Counsellor Blair, 
and well put,” he said, patting his — 
that is, making the Martian sign of 
assent/ agreement. 

"Good. You seem rather more 
formal than we, by the way, and 
although I must admit I enjoy being 
called Counsellor just as if I were 
as important as someone with a 
Ph.D in Physical Education, I think 
it might be simpler if you just call- 
ed me Joe, Counsellor Lars.” 

Then is when I got scared. First 



his eyes swelled up, and he became 
in every sense of the word a Bug- 
Eyed, ah, Martian. His fingers 
twitched. All of them, on all four 
arms, which is one hell of a lot of 
twitching. His ears moved. His big 
lower lip trembled, and the upper 
one writhed. 

And then I saw the tears be- 
gin to creep down his green cheeks, 
glittering like emeralds and trem- 
bling as his cheeks seemed to shud- 
der. He rose, slowly. I braced my- 
self, wondering how six or eight 
of my valuable innards had got 
themselves jammed up in my throat. 
I wondered, too, what sort of 
weapon my cigaret would prove 
against an acre or so of green flesh. 

He executed a bow that would 
have cricked Charlie Chan’s back 
and a tear made a dark spot on the 
Federal Gold carpet. He rose slow- 

ly- 

"You honor me most highly, most 
eminent Counsellor-of-Law of 
Earth,” he said. "I shall never for- 
get this moment. Nor shall the 
authorities on my planet fail to 
be apprised of your obvious con- 
nate comity! With honor this rep- 
resentative of the Sons of Lars ac- 
cepts your name, Joe.” 

TT7ell, I couldn’t think of much 
^ ^ to do save sigh gustily and 
beam at him. I certainly wasn’t 
about to tell him his English vo- 
cabulary transcended mine! At any 
rate, with a great deal of obvious

IF 




ritual, he then reciprocated, and I 
was given permission/honor to call 
him Lark. (Lark! 400 pounds of 
long green!) I stood up and damn 
near broke my back bowing. It 
seemed the least I could do, inas- 
much as I was totally unable to 
obtain the cooperation of my lach- 
rymal glands in producing a tear 
or two for the occasion. Then we 
both sat, and I started another 
cigaret, and my old buddy Lark let 
me have it between the eyes. 

"For many decades, and you 
realize of course we can and will 
spell out the full period of time, 
Joe; for many decades, I say, the 
inhabitants of your planet have 
heaped malicious, malevolent, and 
maleficient malignity on the gentle 
people of Mars. In your periodi- 
cals, on your radio, on your tele- 
vision, in books of both stiff and 
soft cover, in conversation and 
drama and even poetry, you have 
designated the gentle inhabitants 
of this sun’s fourth planet as every 
form of monster and imperialist in- 
vader. The War of the Worlds of 
the Englishman Wells and the radio 
version of the same drama by his 
codefendant of the same patronym 
represent only the most infamous 
of the repeated libeling of my peo- 
ple by yours.” 

He paused for breath. So did I. 
I remembered about then to close 
my mouth. The first interplanetary 
libel suit, with Earth’s entire fu- 
ture hinging upon its outcome, and 



/ was supposed to play Perry Ma- 
son for my entire planet! 

"Said libel will certainly have 
an inelectable effect on the rela- 
tions of our two planets and our 
races for years, decades, perhaps 
even centuries to come. Thus my 
outraged people does state its in- 
tent to implead our case against 
persons living and the executors 
and administrators, heirs and as- 
signs of persons deceased, of Her- 
bert G. Welles, Orson Welles, Ed- 
gar R. Burroughs, Otis A. Klein — ” 
and he went on for seven or nine 
minutes with a string of names 
that sounded as if they’d been 
copied from the telephone directo- 
ries of at least three of New York’s 
boroughs; I hadn’t known there 
were so many pen-pushers and type- 
writer-wranglers in the world. He 
finally terminated with: "... and 
the planet Earth ... I” 

Without giving him pause for 
breath I made a figurative leap for- 
ward, mental sabre and raygun in 
hand. "You mean to tell me that 
the advanced race of a planet older 
than this, said race having not 
only interplanetary travel but be- 
ing indeed a part of an interplane- 
tary union, is bringing suit agains: 
my entire world for fiction? The 
countless stories by imaginative 
writers whose plots involve Martian 
menaces?” 

"I do,” he said, unintimidated. 

I nodded. "All right,” I said, with 
a great deal more confidence than 



THE DEFENDANT EARTH

I felt. "Obviously we are guilty, 
however improper an admission 
that may be for an attorney to 
make. However I make it entirely 
off the record and will no doubt 
reconsider before you take any of- 
ficial pretrial depositions. May I 
ask what are the consequences? 
What are our grounds for fight- 
ing the case? In other words what 
the hell are you suing for?” 

T ars Larkas of Mars — they call 
^ it "Srrickle,” which means 
"dirt,” same as "earth” — drew 
himself up and formed twin steeples 
with all four hands. "You will 
show cause why you should not 
be denied membership in the In- 
trasystem Union and indeed for- 
bidden to leave your planet until 
such time as full recompense has 
been made to our gentle people.” 
Well, "gentle” beats "peacelov- 
ing,” anyhow. "Please explain ‘full 
recompense,’ Lar — Counsellor 
Lars,” I requested, getting formal. 
I always get formal when I am af- 
flicted with the regrettable human 
debility known as anger. 

“ ‘Full recompense/ ” he said, “as 
stated and defined shall mean that 
for an equal period of years — 
yours — and in an equal number 
of publications and dramatic pre- 
sentations, the people of Earth shall 
be shown Mars in its true character 
as a gentle, friendly planet — ” 

Well, I thought, at least that isn’t 
too ba — 



" — while Earthmen are clearly 
depicted as inimical, malicious, 
malevolent, maleficient and — ” 

“ — malignant,” I finished. “Not 
to mention morbid and mordadous 
and pretty darned morose. Good 
God, Lark, that ain’t possible! First 
we have to prove we did not do 
something you can prove we’ve 
done with all four arms tied behind 
you. And if we don’t, we’re quaran- 
tined like measle-ridden first-grad- 
ers while we spend decades or what- 
ever cranking out tales about good- 
guy Martians and badguy Earth- 
men! Where the hell’s the justice 
in that sort of one-way street?” 

Once again my new Brother-un- 
der-the-Name (that’s what they 
call it when you’re on a first-name 
basis) looked shocked, or at the 
very least astonished. “But Joel 
It is fair in the extreme! There are 
no punitive damages specified what- 
ever, and the judges’ hands are 
completely tied as to sentence; they 
cannot levy so much as a gram of 
uranium in punitive judgment! You 
should have heard the demands be- 
fore the Intrasystem Union’s Civil 
Council at last agreed on this!” 
"Thank them for me,” I said, 
with a dryness untranscended by 
any possible quantity of gin and 
vermouth. Which prompted me to 
excuse myself and reach for the 
telephone and dial the appropriate 
number. "Room Service? Blair in 
Suite 714. One bottle of vermouth, 
one bottle of gin, a handful of

olives, a lemon, ice and an assort- 
ment of glasses on the double.” I 
paused and then, learning fast the 
ways of Our Nation’s Capitol, add- 
ed, "by order of the Attorney Gen- 
eral!” I blotted the polite voice 
with my finger and dialed again. 
"Please call Attorney General Lay- 
ton, who is somewhere in this ho- 
tel, and advise him Mister Blair 
is most anxious to confer with him. 
Thank you very much.” Another in- 
side number got me another hotel 
voice. I identified myself and drop- 
ped Hank Layton’s name. "Please 
get me Miss Helen Anderson in 
Portsmouth, Ohio.” I gave her the 
zip area or whatever it is and the 
number and hung up. 

4 4 please pardon me, Counsellor,” 
-*■ I said. "Have you brought 
along a secretary or an assistant?” 
"One of each. You were calling 
yours?” 

I nodded. "I can’t do a damned 
thing without Miss Anderson, al- 
though I just realized it. She will 
call my assistant, and they’ll be up 
here, or else. We will be ready to 
meet with you at any time after 
ten in the morning. Make it eleven. 
When is the trial set for, Lark, and 
when may we visit Mars.” 

"The trial will be at your con- 
venience, Joe. And you may not 
visit Mars.” 

"How and to whom do I ap- 
peal?” 

"To the Union; I can help with 



that. But it will do no good; you 
realize of course that this case will 
decide when the people of Earth 
are ready to leave Earth.” 

I stood up and enjoyed gazing 
down at him for the few seconds 
he remained seated. "The men of 
Earth will be in space and on Mars 
within the year, Lars Larkas, and 
then we will see what the Intrasys- 
tem Union thinks of our lawsuit!” 
He was up now, and looking very 
much taken aback. "What suit?” 
"Never mind,” I said airily, going 
to answer the knock at the door. 
"I’ll think of one between now and 
then!” I yanked open the door 
"Hello! Just bring all that right in 
and put it there by that awful or- 
ange chair. Will you stay for a mar- 
tini?” 

Room Service laughed. "Man, I 
heard you were from the South 1” 
"Southern Ohio,” I said. "Lark 
... I guess we’re through for to- 
night. You have a tremendous head 
start on me, but I shall try to make 
it up by eleven in the morning.” 
"I will telephone,” Lars Larkas 
said, and departed. He bent for the 
doorway. 

I grabbed the bottle of gin and 
issued the order to the scarlet-coat- 
ed Room Service to crack open the 
vermouth; that’s harder. "Do you 
have any idea, any idea at all,” 
I asked, "just who THAT was?” 
"No sir,” he said, his eyes danc- 
ing. "All those Martians looked just 
alike to me.” 



THE DEFENDANT EARTH 



57 




When Attorney General Henry C. 
Layton came in, Room Service and 
I were standing integratedly in the 
middle of that Federal Gold car- 
pet screaming with laughter, knuck- 
ling at tear-streaming eyes. 

T began to see how easy it would 
A be to let go and plunge ones- 
self into this nose-in-the-taxpaid- 
trough business. All you have to do 
is look busy and act important. I 
began to look busy. I learned quick- 
ly that a crowd-pleaser and symbol 
of status is the size of one’s staff. I 
had no desire to avail myself of the 
services of the myriad of bright- 
eyed husband-hunters and eager 
young men whose services were of- 
fered, nay urged, by both the At- 
torney General and the President. 

The fact is I don’t like the Feds, 
and told a few so. But I did create 
enough research projects and typ- 
ing to tie up a hundred or so. It oc- 
curred to me that whatever I came 
up with could not look too easy, 
and would have to be done Wash- 
ington-style. Too, there was the ne- 
cessity of window-dressing to im- 
press my worthy opposition. So I 
assigned a few bright-eyed husband- 
hunters and eager young men — 
amazing how many were Ohioans — 
to reading periodicals. Every time 
they came across a story with a ref- 
erence to Mars or Martians, no mat- 
ter how minuscule and no matter 
whether favorable or otherwise, 
they were to have the entire story 



typed and the author contacted. This 
proved very difficult in some cases. 
Writing types seem to move a great 
deal. Whether this is occasioned by 
wanderlust or need of a good at- 
torney is a problem I hope to report 
on later, now that I am an honorary 
member of several organizations 
whose existence somehow escaped 
my knowledge for thirty-six years. 

I had a steady stream of writers 
and editors and even agents through 
my suite, each man giving a state- 
ment and most of them hazarding 
opinions and advice and most of 
them accepting a bite or two of the 
bottles I kept about. Publishers I 
didn’t bother with; they can hustle 
their own drinks. 

Meanwhile Turk — my assistant; 
I’ve mentioned him, haven’t I? — 
and Miss Anderson legged it all 
over and out of town. When I found 
a trustworthy youngster from Cin- 
cinnati who had not graduated from 
anywhere in the inscrutable East 
and who seemed to be interested in 
more than social-climbing, attire, fe- 
males, and not-working, I grabbed 
him for my very own. Then I sent 
Turk home to get some continu- 
ances — he had a letter from the 
President, no less — and try to 
keep my clients happy. Miss An- 
derson formed a friendship, mean- 
while, with her Martian counter- 
part, Miss Omilara Larkas — a 
cousin of Lark’s, the Martian ne- 
potist! 

Omilara nearly lost her gleam-

ing-tusked head; she was a nut 
over imaginative writing and went 
wild over her stream of writers 
and editors. Some nut from Penn- 
sylvania invited her down to his 
farm to attend a writers’ confer- 
ence; another from New York talk- 
ed earnestly with her about setting 
up a reciprocal speaking-engage- 
ment arrangement. She also had a 
weakness for Maker’s Mark and 
branch water — tapwater sufficed 
— and girltalk with Miss Anderson. 

I had to hire her in the end, in- 
asmuch as she won our case for us. 

{4'\X / Te’re ready to go to court,” 
* * I told Lars Larkas three 
weeks after his arrival on Earth. 
(He had yet to tell us how, and we 
had not then discovered his means 
of transport. It played hell, as you 
know, with several transportation 
company stocks for a few days, un- 
til they jumped into the new mode, 
led by the new Hughes Cave Com- 
pany.) "Any time you’re ready, 
Lark. Where do we go?” 

"We set it up via television,” he 
said, looking surprised. I remain 
unconscionably and unreconstruct- 
ably proud of the number of times 
I made him look surprised, that 
mabigionic Martian I "Your Telstar, 
I admit, will make it easier. But — 
are you sure — ” 

I smiled — with my mouth 
closed. "Very sure, Lark. That’s 
why I thought we should have this 
little pretrial conference. You’ll 



join me in a Martini, I presume?” 
"Of course, Joe.” And he made 
a Martini/ Martian play on words 
I will not even record. 

"Lark,” I said, sitting back and 
swinging one leg over the other 
comfortably while pawing my vest 
for cigarets, "you and your people 
should be ashamed of yourselves. 
You have attempted to bamboozle, 
hoodwink, and otherwise pull the 
wool over the eyes of a fine peo- 
ple who haven’t had the opportunity 
to study you as you have us. And 
to steal from us.” 

He gaped. Nasty-looking, those 
tusks. One would think a civilized 
race would do something orthodon- 
tal about that reminder of an ear- 
lier, less friendly existence. 

"It is indeed fortunate for Earth 
that she has a President and an 
Attorney General of such wisdom 
they saw fit to call in the most 
brilliant counsel on the planet to 
handle your allegations,” I said with 
a perfectly straight face. "Hands 
down, Lark; I said allegations, and 
allegations I mean. Drink up. I do 
not plan to answer your charges. 
As a matter of fact I’ll have them 
thrown out of court.” 

I had waited — malevolently, 
maliciously, etc., etc. — until he 
got the glass to his lips. We had 
commandeered some lab beakers to 
facilitate his and his assistants’ 
drinking between their tusks — 
and now I was gratified to see him 
splutter and stain the nice brand-

new Earth-tailored suit he wore. 
With vest. And four armholes. And 
dark red stripe. He peered at me 
over the rim of the glass, not deign- 
ing to brush at his Martini-spot- 
ted clothing. Then, to show his 
calm, he lifted the glass again. And 
I let him have the other barrel. 

“As a matter of fact,” I said, 
flicking my cigaret in the best Hol- 
lywood manner and watching an 
amorphous serpent of pearly smoke 
climb ceilingward, “I will bring not 
one but two countersuits. The sec- 
ond is one that we, and I hope the 
Intrasystem Union’s Civil Council, 
considers even more reprehensible, 
under the circumstances.” 

Tie stared. He ignored the new 
^ * wetspots on his suit. That’s 
one advantage of charcoal worsted 
flannel; spots fade quickly and 
don’t show, unless they’re mustard 
or Hollandaise. 

“First, that the people of Mars 
have for several decades published 
and dramatically exhibited male- 
volent, etceteraetcetera ad M-fini- 
tum libel on the friendly people of 
this planet, by showing Earthmen 
as barbarous invaders and monsters 
attacking and displaying multiform 
and manifold attitudes of enmity 
toward the people of our great and 
respected sister-planet, Mars. Not 
only does this basely libel the friend- 
ly people of this world, but in view 
of your suit it demonstrates your 
people’s regrettable and barbaric 



lack of the civilized trait of fairness 
and justice. How d’you like them 
olives?” 

He put down his glass. 

“Wait,” I said, as he started to 
speak. “Before you start to speak, 
I remind that you that even though 
you came here on an unfriendly 
and indeed underhanded mission 
and we met as opponents and, so to 
speak, enemies, I invited you almost 
at once to call me by my personal 
name. That clearly indicates the 
inherent friendliness, the, as I be- 
lieve you put it, innate comity of 
the people of Earth. You yourself 
have reported that back; gonna 
help my case, isn’t it?” I smiled at 
him. “Nothing personal you under- 
stand, Lark, although you do rep- 
resent your government on a career 
basis, and I do hate Feds. But then 
there’s the matter of the second 
charge, purely aside from the fact 
that you’ve just published just as 
many novels and dramas in which 
we were monsters. 

I let him stew while I poured 
some more Martini, offered him 
some with a gesture and an eye- 
brow-question — he refused with a 
violent nod — and lighted up a 
new cigaret. I hadn’t enjoyed my- 
self so much since I nailed that 
snotty DA’s son for larceny and 
Possession back in 1962. 

“Far more serious in my eyes 
is your obvious cynicism, your ob- 
vious dishonesty as a people. You 
are an uncreative lot, aren’t you?

the Green Planet hmp! Your so- 
called writers have stolen and palm- 
ed off as their own all of our im- 
aginative fiction, changing only the 
names to protect the Martians!” 

Watching him collapse and begin 
to look small in his big chair — I’d 
had a hernia-size one provided, to 
make him less overbearing, I went 
on. “Your people brought this suit 
against us only in order to cover 
up decades, centuries of plagiarism, 
to keep us restricted to this planet.” 

I leaned back slowly and enjoyed 
a large sip of good cold Martini. 
My baby-blue eyes remained on 
Lars Larkas’ red ones. "I might,” 
I said very quietly, "even go so far 
as to ask why your name bears 
such a strong resemblance to one 
invented by an Earth creator named 
Burroughs.” 

"How . did you . find out?” 

"That does it! I temind you, 
Brother-under-the-Name, of our 
agreement of three weeks’ duration: 
I have been recording ever since 
you came into this room.” 

Tt seems to me that the best thing 
to do was allow him to report 
home and let his leaders back 
down, which they did, and start 
taking steps to set up a wholesale 
book-burning, which they did. I ad- 
mit I felt a little bad about not 
pressing to obtain royalties for all 



those earthly writers whose works 
were so well known on Mars un- 
der other names, and reprinted al- 
most verbatim all over a planet 
whose people had one terrible de- 
bility; a lack of creative literary 
ability. But they are scientific whiz- 
zes, and it seemed to me at the 
time — and now — that we are best 
advised to get things started on a 
friendly basis. So I got them to 
withdraw the suit and the black- 
ball, and we were officially con- 
tacted by the Intrasystem Union 
last week. And I am a thoroughly 
dishonest so-and-so; I have told no 
one how I won the dismissal. 
And now I have a seven-foot 
green secretary, since Omilara nat- 
urally got her tail canned — figure 
of speech; tails they don y t have — 
when Lars Larkas and his people 
found out who’d spilled the beans to 
my Miss Anderson. 

And I am meeting with several 
presidents of several writers’ groups 
next week, to discuss my new job: 
I’m apparently going to represent 
a few thousand ^writers on Mars, 
through my contact and business 
partner, Lars Larkas. 

The most enormous and also 
best-paying market for speculative 
fiction of all time has just opened 
up on a planet without speculators, 
and someone has to act as agent. 

I figure that if standard rate for 
foreign sales is twenty percent, I 
can charge at least double that for 
interplanetary agenting fees. END

and WHEN 

by LESTER DEL REY 



There are nine and sixty means 
of upsetting human genes 
And every single one of them is . 



Qcience fiction has been called 
^ escape literature, and the term 
may be correct — but in a way no 
literary critic has yet realized. The 
writers and readers apparent- 
ly aren’t escaping from the prob- 
lems of the world, but to the prob- 
lems that the rest of the world 
doesn’t yet know about. 

So far, those major problems 
seem to come along about once 
every decade; or the public be- 
comes aware of them at that rate. 
Twenty years ago, people became 
aware of the danger of atomic 
destruction. Then there was con- 
sternation as the first Sputnik 
sailed overhead. In both cases, 
science fiction had discussed the 
ideas so long that there was no 



shock left to the events for readers 
of our magazines. 

Now there is a new problem, this 
time as a result of the amazing 
progress of biology. Most of the 
possibilities will be far from new 
to science fiction, but I suspect 
that full realization of what man 
can do in the near future in tink- 
ering with life will be a more pro- 
found shock to most people than 
any previous problem. 

This is all discussed in The 
Biological Time Bomb, a book, by 
Gordon Rattray Taylor. It’s the 
first complete survey I’ve seen for 
the general public, and it does cover 
almost everything being discussed 
by scientists up to the time of its 
publication. While many of the 



62 




possibilities will be somewhat 
familiar to science-fiction readers, 
the impact of the total collective 
ability of man to alter himself and 
his race in the next half century is 
impressive — < perhaps even “more 
earth-shaking than the atom 
bomb,” as the jacket copy claims. 

One of the most interesting parts 
of the book is the time-table given 
in the last chapter. By the year 
2000, Taylor lists such probabilities 
as baby-factories, artificial increase 
of intelligence in men and animals, 
the creation of one-celled life forms, 
and even the making of half-man, 
half-animal monsters — or chimer- 
as. Even before then, we should 
have the power to choose the sex 
of our children and to build artifi- 
cial viruses. A little further in the 
future, there should be control of 
ageing, control of heredity by ma- 
nipulation of the genes, and such 
“horrors” as disembodied brains 
linked to computers. 

Such a listing could come out of 
science fiction, of course. But in this 
case, Taylor cites the experimental 
work and the words of the scientists 
in the field, and the time-table is 
one he has averaged from their pre- 
dictions. He also makes a serious 
attempt to analyze the impact of 
such developments on human so- 
ciety, together with the dangers to 
be faced. 

Generally, it’s a bock worth read- 
ing carefully. The soft cover edition 
should be out shortly; look for it. 



T here’s nothing new about man 
tinkering with life or even 
himself, of course. Skeletons dug 
up from neolithic times show evi- 
dence of trepanning — the boring 
of a hole in the skull to relieve 
pressure or let the demons out. Men 
deformed the feet of their women 
and tattooed and circumsized them- 
selves from ancient days. They also 
changed much of the plant and 
animal life around them. Wheat was 
evolved from the primitive einkom 
before written records, and the dog 
has been so completely altered and 
diversified by breeding that we 
can’t be sure of his original ances- 
try. 

So far, men haven’t made any 
radical changes in their own nature, 
but our literature suggests that the 
idea has been with us for a long 
time. Plato’s Republic represented 
special types of men — soldiers, 
workers, etc. — bred to type, like 
ants in a colony. And a fair amount 
of what science proposes to do was 
covered in Huxley’s Brave New 
World. 

Even the cyborg — the mixture 
of cybernetic machine and human 
organism — has been foreshadowed. 
Bifocal glasses are probably the 
most common example, dating from 
the time of Ben Franklin, though 
the cybernetic element of control 
was still in the eye of the beholder, 
in that case. 

The only change has been in the 
sudden development of cybernetics, 



IF . AND WHEN

medicine and biology within the 
last twenty years. Recently, for in- 
stance, the newspapers carried the 
story of an artificial arm which is 
controlled by nerve impulses and 
powered by electric energy. We are 
learning to overcome the body’s 
immune reaction against anything 
other than its own tissue, and trans- 
planted limbs and organs are no 
longer news. We’ve developed in- 
fertility drugs, and we’ve begun to 
tinker with the DNA molecule — 
the huge molecule that controls 
heredity and makes us what we are. 

What we have not yet begun is 
the real investigation of the con- 
sequences, except in science fiction. 
Larry Niven’s Organleggers in Gal- 
axy suggests what might happen 
in a world where there was more 
demand for spare human parts than 
any normal supply. But, as Taylor 
points out, even such a simple thing 
as controlling the sex of our off- 
spring can have a major impact on 
society. What happens if most par- 
ents want boys, as they will in 
many parts of the world? If there 
are two or three males for each fe- 
male, what happens to our family 
institutions? If the female to male 
ratio is about even in one country 
and there’s a dearth of females in 
another, will we have another war 
and rape of the Sabines? Of course, 
if society can adapt to the change, 
this might be an answer to the pop- 
ulation explosion. 

On the other hand, the possibil- 



ity of extreme prolongation of life 
and youthful vigor within the next 
fifty years would seem to make con- 
trolling the population impossible. 
So far, fortunately as I see it, there 
is evidence that the DNA in the 
cells doesn’t quite maintain itself 
perfectly, which reduces the chance 
of immortality; but even that is 
questionable for the future, since 
Japanese geneticists have found the 
cell’s self-healing power greater 
than we expected and are studying 
ways to improve this. 

Anyhow, with organs grown to 
replace defective ones or with arti- 
ficial cybernetic organs, life almost 
certainly is going to be greatly pro- 
longed. 

Cloning also rears its head in the 
book. This is the trick of taking a 
few cells from the body and grow- 
ing them in a culture; since each 
cell carries the DNA responsible 
for the whole organism, it should 
be possible to grow a whole new 
individual. It has already been done 
with such vegetables as the carrot. 
The personality would be different, 
due to different environmental 
forces, but the basic abilities would 
be the same. How many super- 
geniuses should we grow from each 
natural one? 

TV/Tost of these steps involve tink- 
ering wilh the individual. 
They may prove rather shocking to 
the general reader, but no perman- 
ent racial harm can come from

IF 




them, except for the impact of such 
a change on the society. They are 
aH reversible. If cyborgs prove 
harmful, we can stop creating them 
— or man-animal chimeras, or 
whatever. A sex imbalance will be 
corrected by changing demands 
created by the scarcity of one sex 
or the other. Even immortality 
(that is, an extreme life extension) 
would probably be corrected when 
tiie population got out of hand; the 
food wars would see to that. 

But tinkering with the DNA 
molecule is another matter, and it 
might not be reversible. Unques- 
tionably within the next fifty years 
men will learn how to alter the tiny 
genes within the egg and sperm 
cells and change heredity. Scien- 
tists can already substitute part of 
one virus for another and create a 
viable new virus. But now we are 
tinkering with the basic germ 
plasm of the human race. 

All the results of such changes 
would not show up at once. Some 
might well not show up for genera- 
tions, as recessive characteristics 
lay dormant at first. There is al- 
ready evidence of gene-linked 
characteristics that can wait for 
generations to develop. And by the 
time the results were in, there 
might be no chance to return to 
the immensely varied racial germ 
stock. 

Who can determine what changes 
in heredity should be made, any- 
how? Such power would hardly re- 



main in the hands of scientists; it 
has too much political power in- 
herent in it. And even assuming 
absolute benevolence, who can be 
sure of what characteristics to 
breed for — or build into mankind? 

Apparently, we have already 
been tinkering with this far more 
than we realized until recently. 
Twenty years ago, we were fairly 
sure that mutations — changes in 
the DNA-heredity factors — could 
only occur as a result of something 
as violent as ionizing radiation from 
X-rays, atomic explosions, etc. Now 
nothing is so simple. 

Viruses infect bacteria and swap 
DNA fractions, producing muta- 
tions; the same effect may cause 
cancer in human tissue. Drugs can 
produce such changes. Thalidomide 
caused deformed births, though no 
one so far has determined whether 
this change is hereditary. But there 
is increasing evidence that LSD and 
other hallucinogens alter the germ 
plasm. 

We don’t know what other drugs 
may effect such changes. And we’ve 
bombarded our systems with an in- 
credible variety of chemicals, from 
preservatives in our food through 
pain-killers to industrial by-prod- 
ucts in the atmosphere. Even with- 
out trying, we may have been tink- 
ering with our own heredity. If we 
do so deliberately, the results may 
seem better — but in being less 
random, they may prove to be 
much harder to correct. 



IF . • . AND WHEN 



65 




'T'here’s even a degree of “social” 
tinkering. Every time we save 
a child from dying of some hered- 
itary problem, we theoretically 
weaken the racial germ stock by 
keeping an individual with what 
would previously have been a self- 
defeating defect. And we’re a lot 
less sure of what’s hereditary than 
we once thought. Even the high 
amount of near-sightedness may 
have come about because eye- 
glasses made the defective vision 
so easy to correct that it could then 
compete with those having normal 
vision. (One “defect” that seems 
uhimportant — since men will 
probably never lose the ability to 
grind lenses now.) 

Certainly the increasing innocu- 
lation of children against all kinds 
of diseases will tend to place less 
advantage on a high ability to fight 
off disease, and possibly weaken the 
race. 

Such “social” tinkering has been 
largely a passive response to devel- 
opments, based mostly on a failure 
to re-examine old values. But from 
now on, as Taylor points out in his 
last chapter, society must take full 
responsibility. The decisions that 
must be made in the use of the 
newly developed possibilities for 
human-engineering are too big for 



a few scientists or a group of semi- 
informed politicians. (And even the 
decision not to tinker is itself too 
big for any group now existing to 
accept.) 

Sooner or later, he believes, we’re 
going to have to create a responsible 
organization to oversee the devel- 
opments and plan for the integra- 
tion of the results into our way of 
life — or we’ll lose that way of life. 

This is the only really frighten- 
ing concept I find in the book. It’s 
a case where there has to be some 
answer, but no answer looks good. 
And here for the first time we get 
out of the proper element of sci- 
ence fiction and into politics 
where no writer has done more than 
skirt around the problems. 

Maybe there will be a political 
answer. In that case, I have a feel- 
ing that ten years from now we’ll 
get a book on the next great prob- 
lem to face humanity. It might be 
called The Political Time Bomb — 
a frightening examination of the 
new breakthroughs in political sci- 
ence and the dangers there that 
must be controlled. 

By then, I hope, science fiction 
will have helped to let us escape 
into the future ahead of time, as it 
has done with all our other major 
problems END

Illustrated by 



C4Hphe people against John Wil- 
* son,” a man said. It was 
chanted like an incantation, and it 
echoed in his head. “The people 
against John Wilson. The people 
against John Wilson.” 

John Wilson. John Wilson. Then 
he remembered. He was John Wil- 
son. He tried to open his eyes and 
found they were open. Slowly, as 
he tried to remember what he had 
been doing before this moment, 
where he had been, who he was, 
his surroundings swam into focus. 

He was in a large room with a 
high ceiling. He was conscious of 
the size before he saw it. Varnished 
wood was slick under his hands. He 
was seated in a wooden armchair 
at a long wooden table. The wood 
was light colored, oak perhaps. 
Opposite him was another long 
table. Two men sat on the other 
side of it, facing him. One was a 
big, blocky man with light brown 
hair and lumpy features. The other 
was smaller and younger. He had 
a large nose and dark, curly hair 
that grew low on his forehead. His 
lips seemed set in a perpetual 
sneer, and his close-set, black eyes 
squinted now at Wilson, looking 
into Wilson’s eyes speculatively. 

Wilson stared back. He wondered 
why this young man was so inter- 
ested in him. 

Another voice was speaking. 
“John Wilson, please stand,” it 
said. The voice had said the same 
thing before. 



“Can you stand up?” asked a 
voice beside him. The voice was 
light and drawling, with an edge 
of irony. 

Wilson put his hands on the arms 
of the chair and pushed himself 
erect. 

It was no particular effort, 
but once he was up the room spun 
around him in a blur of alternating 
darkness and light. The illusion re- 
minded him of a carousel ride when 
he was young, and he watched it 
with interest and nostalgia. 

As the room began to slow and 
settle into place, he saw a man 
placed higher than he was some ten 
paces to his right. The man was 
seated behind a tall, broad desklike 
piece of furniture. The front of 
it was made of oak, too, and it was 
carved into patterns of rectangles 
within rectangles. 

The man behind the desk leaned 
forward. He had gray, wavy hair 
and a triangular face. “I say again, 
John Wilson,” he said, “you are 
accused of arson and of murder in 
the first degree. How do you 
plead?” 

(( Arson?” Wilson thought. 

^ “Murder?” Had he burned 
something? Killed somebody? He 
could not remember. He could re- 
member flames, yes, flames roaring 
in the night and forked, black 
figures running back and forth. 
And he could remember a silent 
crowd that waited for the figures 



41 



IF 




with dubs and pitchforks and axes, 
and some of the black figures chose 
the flames. But it was more like 
the memory of a nightmare than 
of something real. It had the spec- 
tatorlike quality of a dream. Was 
it reality instead, something he had 
pushed into the subconscious 
through fear or guilt? 

The drawling voice beside him 
helped. “My client pleads not 
guilty,” it said. 

“Thank you, Mr. Youngman,” 
said the man behind the desk. 
Only it was not a desk, of course. 
It was a bench, and the man was a 
judge. 

He was being tried for arson and 
minder, Wilson told himself, and 
he couldn’t remember what he had 
done or what had brought him here 
or, now that he thought about it, 
anything of his past. Was he a 
victim of amnesia? Of course not. 
There was no such thing as amnesia. 
Of that he was sure. Only he didn’t 
know why he was sure. 

Wilson sank back into his chair, 
thankful he had been relieved of 
the compulsion to speak, thankful, 
too, that someone had believed in 
him enough to speak up for his 
innocence. 

His heart overflowing with warm- 
th, Wilson turned his head to the 
left. Seated beside him was a tall, 
thin man with short, sandy hair 
and a face like a beardless Lincoln. 
His long legs were curled under his 
chair, His body was curled, too, 



until it rested on its spine. He was 
cadaverously thin. IBs face was 
tanned, and his indolent body 
seemed coiled with wiry strength. 
He smiled at Wilson and nodded 
as if to say, “You don’t need to 
say anything. We’re in this to- 
gether, you and I.” 

Or so Wilson interpreted it, with 
relief — partly because he did not 
know what to say, partly because 
he was not sure he could muster 
the will to speak. 

Men and women were being 
questioned, one at a time, as they 
sat in a chair on a platform raised 
a foot above the floor to the right 
of the judge’s bench. The women 
seemed much alike and so did the 
men. The women were dressed in 
long dark dresses of gray or black 
or dark blue cotton, the men in 
coveralls with blue shirts or oc- 
casionally a dark suit with a blue 
shirt underneath open at the 
throat. So, too, were dressed the 
men at the table opposite him. One 
of them was not at the table now. 
He was asking questions of the men 
and women who sat in the chair. 
The younger one sat at the table. 
He said nothing. He stared at 
Wilson or occasionally allowed his 
gaze to drift around the room. 

The questioning had been going 
on for some time now, Wilson de- 
cided. He must have drifted away 
again because half the chairs facing 
him in front of the oak partition 
now were filled with men and worn- 




en. Like the young man at the 
table, they spent most of their time 
looking at him. 

“Do you have a financial inter- 
est in any scientific laboratory?” 
the blocky man was asking. “Has 
any member of your family attended 
college? Taught in college? Per- 
formed research? Has any member 
of your family benefited from any 
of the so-called miracle treatments 
for organic disease? Do any of them 
have artificial organs?” 

“Objection!” Youngman said oc- 
casionally. 

“Overruled,” said the judge. 

I f the answer to any of his 
questions was “yes,” the blocky 
man said, “You are dismissed,” and 
if the answer to all of them was 
“no,” he would turn to Youngman 
with a little bow. Then Youngman 
would uncoil himself and standing 
negligently beside the table ask 
idle questions. He was not content 
to ask the same questions over and 
over like the blocky man. He asked 
some of the men and women wheth- 
er they had made up their minds 
about the case, some whether they 
had seen the university burn, some 
whether they knew the defendant, 
and one whether he had any pre- 
judices about science or scientists. 

“Objection, your honor,” said the 
blocky man. 

“Sustained,” said the judge, and 
he turned to Youngman to say, “I 
must warn you, Counselor, that this 



line of questioning is not permis- 
sible. Science is not on trial here. 
Nor are scientists.” 

“Exception,” said Youngman. 
“The derk will note the fact as 
grounds for appeal. Sdence and 
sdentists are on trial here, as they 
are throughout this nation and 
throughout the world. Universities 
are being burned; sdentists are 
being hunted down and extermin- 
ated ...” 

“I must caution you, Counselor, 
that you are risking contempt pro- 
ceedings with this outburst,” the 
judge said. 

“I will call attention to the ir- 
regularities of this trial,” Youngman 
said, “as the basis for an appeal 
not only to a higher court but to 
a higher jury.” He waved his hand 
toward the back of the room. 
“There is the proof of the nature 
of this trial ...” 

“If you do not control yourself 
I will also dismiss you from this 
case,” the judge said. 

Wilson let his attention wander. 
To his left was a wooden railing. 
In the railing were three wooden 
gates on hinges, one at either side 
of him and one behind him where 
the railing jogged to allow room 
for a doorway with double doors 
into the courtroom. 

Beyond the railing was the 
audience. They sat on pewlike 
benches. They sat silently in their 
dark dresses and their blue shirts, 
their hands folded in their laps or 



7ft 



IF 




their arms folded arcoss their 
chests. They stared at him. Wilson 
could not read their expressions, 
whether it was judgment suspended 
or judgment passed. If he was an 
arsonist and a murderer they would 
hate him, of course. Good men and 
women were bound to hate evil. 

Here and there in the audience 
were a few persons who did not 
seem to fit with the rest — a beau- 
tiful blonde girl with short hair, 
young men with hard faces and 
watchful eyes, a few men in uni- 
form on the front row. 

Behind the audience, at the back 
of the aisles, were the television 
cameras pointed at the front of the 
room, at the men and women in the 
witness chair or at the lawyers or 
at the judge or at someone behind 
Wilson, but mostly at Wilson him- 
self. He amused himself with watch- 
ing the little red eye beneath the 
long lenses, particularly when he 
could tell that the lens was pointing 
toward him. 

The blocky man — what had the 
judge called him? Oh, yes, the 
district attorney — was talking to 
the jury, but he kept turning to- 
ward the television cameras. The 
twelve chairs for the jury were 
placed in two rows of six; they 
all were filled. Above them was a 
crowded balcony. The balcony was 
reached by a narrow corridor be- 
hind the paneled partition that 
formed the back of the jury box 
and by a circular staircase at the 



end of the corridor. In the balcony 
were people jvho kept pointing 
things at him. 

The district attorney was saying, 
“I shall prove that this man, in 
league with others like him, 
planned the burning of the Univer- 
sity to discredit the Lowbrow 
Party and the Senate Subcommit- 
tee on Academic Practices and ini 
an attempt to gain sympathy for 
the egghead cause, that the fire 
got out of hand and killed many 
of the arsonists themselves, but 
that this man, John Wilson, es- 
caped and made his way to the 
Gulf Coast, where he attempted to 
sell his services and his nation’s 
secrets to a foreign power and where 
he was captured by courageous 
members of this nation’s national 
police force and returned to the 
Federal Penitentiary to stand 
trial ...” 

There was no doubt, Wilson 
thought. The expression of the au- 
dience was hate. 

Before the scene faded out he 
decided that he liked the other 
dream better. As this one ended he 
felt Youngman take him by the 
hand in farewell. Then he was in 
some kind of wheeled vehicle. From 
the vibration he thought it was 
moving fast. He was lying flat on 
a kind of cot. On the other side 
was another cot. Someone was sit- 
ting on it. In a moment he recog- 
nized the dark-haired young man 
from the courtroom* 



TRIAL BY FIRE

“He keeps coming out of it,” the 
young man said. He had an eastern 
accent. His voice had a sneer to it, 
too. “Give him a bigger dose.” 

Someone leaned over him, shut- 
ting off his view of the young man, 
and he felt something cold and me- 
tallic placed against his bare arm. 
He heard a hissing noise, and the 
cold object went away. 

He turned on his left side and 
let his eyelids descend. After a 
suitable period he tried to read 
the note Youngman had pressed in- 
to his hand. The light through 
the barred window beside him 
flickered, but he finally made out 
the words. 

“You’re under some kind of 
sedation. Next time try to cut 
yourself. We’ll analyze the blood. 
Destroy the note. It’s soluble in 
water.” 

How interesting, ^Wilson thought. 
He worked his hand up to his 
mouth and slipped the paper be- 
tween his lips. It dissolved all 
right. It tasted like peppermint . 

II 

H e dreamed. He dreamed that he 
woke in the transparent dark- 
ness just before dawn. Someone was 
hammering at the door. “Doctor,” 
the door murmured through the 
house. “Doctor.” He got up quick- 
ly and slipped into his white coat. 
He never appeared to the villagers 
dressed like an ordinary man. That 



would corrode their confidence. 

When he reached the door, it 
transmitted to him the voice of an 
excited woman. “Doctor, my little 
girl!” And more knocking. 

He pressed a button beside the 
door, as he ran his fingers through 
his hair. It was the blonde Pat Hel- 
man, as he had thought. He could 
see her plainly in the mirror beside 
the door. She had her daughter in 
in her arms. They were alone. 

Wilson took a stimulant pill from 
the dispenser beside the door, shook 
off the last remnants of his dis- 
turbed slumber and told the door 
to open. “Come in,” he said to the 
woman. 

He took the little girl from her 
mother and carried her into the 
laboratory, shutting the door of the 
white-tiled room carefully in the 
mother’s face. The girl was hot and 
breathing rapidly but still con- 
scious. He placed the girl on the 
diagnostic table and set the dials 
for her identification. 

The computer clicked as it 
searched its memory bank for the 
girl’s medical history. The sensors 
applied themselves to the girl’s 
body while Wilson soothed her 
fears with a calm hand and a cal- 
mer voice. In a moment the diag- 
nosis appeared in the frosted glass 
above the little girl’s head. Enceph- 
alitis . 

The injection came immediately 
afterward, painless, virtually un- 
felt.

IF 




Wilson returned the girl to her 
mother. “She’ll be all right now,” 
he said confidently. “But hang 
this around her neck to ward off 
evil.” It was a simple puzzle. Per- 
haps the girl would improve her 
mind with it. 

“Thank you, Doctor, thank you, 
thank you,” the young woman said, 
unable to stop. “She would have 
died.” 

“Yes,” Wilson said. She would 
have, too, he thought. “How is 
your husband’s leg?” 

“All healed. He was walking on 
it the next day, just as if it had 
never been broken.” 

“And does he remember to say 
the charm?” 

“The two-times-two? Yes, doctor. 
I’m even beginning to say it as 
well, just from hearing it so often.” 
“It won’t hurt you,” Wilson said. 
“You missed much instruction, 
coming from the city.” 

“We’ll bring you a pig, Doctor!” 
“I am here to help. Is every- 
thing all right in the village?” 
“The stranger is still at the mo- 
tel. The one we suspect is a tax 
collector. He has been asking ques- 
tions about you.” 

“By name?” 

“No. He asks only about our 
witch-doctor. Are you good? Do 
you charge too much? Where do 
you live? Do you have visitors? 
We do not tell him anything.” 
“Thank you, my dear.” 

He did not have time to think 



about the stranger in the village. 
Scarcely had the door closed be- 
hind Pat Helman and her daughter 
than the knocking began again and 
the door announced other callers. 

TT'irst it was a farmer whose com 
was not growing as it should 
in spite of fertilizer and water. He 
brought a sample of soil. The ana- 
lyzer said it was too acid, and Wil- 
son gave him a wagonload of holy 
powder to work into the land. A 
delivery truck limped in for service. 
The analyzer revealed that the re- 
actor element was worn out and 
would have to be replaced and sent 
in for renewal. Even with the auto- 
matic equipment in the sealed gar- 
age, the job took half an hour. 

Then came the most difficult 
part of Wilson’s job, the birth of a 
child with a brain injury. The di- 
agnosis was quick and the reaction 
immediate. The child was dead as 
soon as the computer clicked out 
the judgment that it would never 
lead more than a vegetable exist- 
ence. Wilson found the mother’s 
gratitude most difficult to endure, 
but he knew it was deserved. 

By this time the sun was well 
up, and the time for religious in- 
struction was at hand. In the class- 
room was a sprinkling of children 
from four to sixteen, and even a 
few married women who could not 
go on the pilgrimage and were not 
yet tied down by children. He wel- 
comed them all. 



TRIAL BY FIRE

After an invocation and a brief 
sermon, Wilson settled them to 
their individual programs at their 
individual learning stations. Soon 
they were listening to the personal- 
ized instruction that seemed to 
come to them out of the air. They 
listened for a few minutes, wrote 
on the magic tablets in front of 
them, and then compared their an- 
swers with the one in the soothsayer 
window beside the tablet. 

Wilson left them and returned 
to his living quarters in the self- 
contained cottage. It was identical 
with thousands of such cottages in 
villages across the world. Now he 
would have a few moments of rest, 
while everyone was at work in their 
homes or in the fields or in the 
classroom. Perhaps he would even 
have time for a little research of 
his own. 

But he did not have the time after 
all. He had no more settled himself 
into his favorite chair in the study 
than the computer told him that 
someone had followed him from 
the classroom. When the light rap- 
ping came at the door he knew who 
it had to be. 

“Come in, Christopher,” he said. 

It was the James boy — 17 
years old and a good student, a 
handsome, quick, inquisitive lad 
with an annoying habit of arguing 
with his elders that caused dissen- 
sion in the village. His parents de- 
spaired of making him a cooperating 
part of the family group. 



But he was humble now. “Doc- 
tor,” he said, “I wish to be a wise 
man like you.” 

“How like me?” Wilson asked. 
“Wise like you. I wish to know 
all things.” 

“I do not know all things. The 
universe is infinite and eternal, and 
even if a man searched through in- 
finity for an eternity still he would 
not know all things.” 

“I wish then to know as much 
as a man can know.” 

“Knowledge alone is neither a 
blessing nor a virtue.” 

“It is all I want.” 

“The passion for knowledge is ai 
fever that can consume a man.” 
“I am consumed now. How can 
I learn more?” 

“There in the classroom.” 

“The voice of God tells me only 
what I know already. It is drill 
only, and I do it perfectly.” 

'T'hat was true. Wilson know. The 
^ boy had made no mistakes for 
weeks. The computer had warned 
him that it was time for the boy 
to begin his pilgrimage. “Knowl- 
edge is worthless without an end. 
The idle learner is a danger not 
only to himself but to others. He 
will put his knowledge to work only 
to satisfy his idle curiosity, heed- 
less of the consequences.” 

The boy argued. “This survey is 
man’s destiny — to seek truth and 
to follow wherever it leads. Truth 
is the greatest good. If some are 



74 



IF 




hurt in the discovery, some always 
will be hurt — in the absence of 
truth even more than in its pres- 
ence — and it is better that they 
be hurt in the search for truth than 
in the protection of their ignor- 
ance.” 

“The man who has found true 
wisdom does not deal in right and 
wrong; he does not judge ends. For 
some, truth is a good, for others, a 
god. It must be good for all or it 
is good for none. God must serve 
man, not man God. The latter way 
leads to cruelty and amorality 
justified by self-righteousness.” 
“How can truth be good for all?” 
Christopher asked sullenly. 

“I have sought truth all my life,” 
said Wilson. “How do I use the 
little I have found?” 

“You serve the village, but — ” 
“Yes?” 

The boy burst out, “What good 
is knowledge? If one cannot seek 
more, if with every step one can- 
not see the universe opening up?” 
Wilson was silent. He let the 
boy think about it. 

“I suppose,” Christopher said 
reluctantly, “you do not stop seek- 
ing. But you spend time in service 
when you might be learning.” He 
was silent again. “I suppose I 
could learn to serve.” 

“That is part of what you must 
learn,” Wilson said. 

“How do I start?” 

“The way of the seeker after 
truth is long and difficult.” 



The boy nodded. Wilson thought, 
he could not know; how hard and 
how difficult it was, but perhaps, 
perhaps, he would follow the path 
to its end. 

“You have lived in this village 
long enough,” Wilson said* “Now 
you must go out and learn some- 
thing about the world. You will 
wander from place to place learn- 
ing about people and serving them, 
doing for them what they cannot 
do for themselves, and learning to 
do it with a glad heart. Perhaps 
you may spend some time at the 
Emperor’s Court. Perhaps you may 
visit another kingdom. But if you 
learn well and seek long, you may 
find the way to greater knowledge 
than you now dream of.” 

“When can I begin?” the boy 
asked. 

“Ask your parents,” Wilson said 
gently. “Tell them I said you are 
ready for the pilgrimage.” They 
would be sorry to see the boy go, 
he thought, and yet rdieved. 

The boy turned eagerly toward 
the door and then swung back. 
“Will I ever be like you, Doctor?” 

“If you seek long and are found 
worthy, you will learn much. One 
day, if you are successful in all 
things, you will be expected to 
serve as I do.” 

“May I be worthy I” the boy 
said. 

As he left, the door admitted 
George Johnson, the village

elder. He was breathless with ex- 
citement “Doctor,” he said, pant- 
ing. “There are soldiers in the vil- 
lage.” 

“How many?” 

“Eight and a sergeant They are 
demanding taxes.” 

“They or the stranger?” 

“The stranger. He commands 
them.” 

“Where are they?” 

“At the motel. Shall we refuse 
to pay? Shall we resist?” 

“‘Render unto Caesar what is 
Caesar’s.’ But I will go to speak 
with them.” 

When he reached the motel, he 
found two soldiers in imperial pur- 
ple guarding the door with their 
pellet guns. They stirred uneasily 
at the sight of his white jacket and 
then stood aside to admit him. 

At a table in the dining room, a 
man in a wrinkled suit and an open- 
collared blue shirt was accepting 
a few pieces of gold jewelry from 
one of the villagers and checking 
off a name on a list. The man 
looked up, and an expression of 
sardonic delight crossed his face as 
he waved the villager away. 

The man was out of Wilson’s 
persistent nightmare. He had dark, 
curly hair that grew low on his 
forehead, a large nose, and close- 
set black eyes that looked specu- 
latively into Wilson’s.” 

“You have come.” 

“You state the obvious.” 

“The rest is incidental,” the 



young man said. “Worthwhile but 
incidental. We wished only to get 
you away from your fortress. We 
have had quite enough of their 
defenses.” 

“Here I am,” Wilson said. “If 
you are on a witch-hunt, you have 
found someone who will serve your 
purpose.” 

“You will be taken to district 
court for trial.” 

Wilson nodded. 

The villagers were gathered out- 
side in the dusk when Wilson was 
taken out of the motel, his hands 
chained behind him. The villagers 
stirred toward the soldiers, and 
the pellet guns came up quickly. 

Wilson stepped forward. “Go 
home,” he said. “They will not do 
to me anything that I do not per- 
mit. There will be another doctor 
here to help you while I am gone. 
Go home. Do not resist the Em- 
peror’s soldiers.” 

The villagers parted. The soldiers 
put him into the wagon and sat on 
the benches on either side as the 
horses started the wagon along the 
cracked, old, four-lane highway to 
the city... 

in 

O nce more the voice of the bail- 
iff parted the fog that filled 
his mind. “All rise. District court, 
Judge Green presiding, is now in 
session.” 

The twelve good men and true 

IF

— some of than women, fo be truly 
accurate — were back in their oak 
jury box. The little balcony above 
the jury was crowded. Wilson had 
the feeling that it was balanced 
precariously on stilts and that it 
might topple forward at any mo- 
ment. As Wilson’s gaze drifted 
around the room, he saw that the 
benches beyond the railing to his 
left were filled as well. He looked 
until he saw the blonde girl and 
smiled. The television cameras 
were back, too, their red lights 
switching back and forth hypnot- 
ically. 

Perhaps it was because he had 
been here before. Perhaps, if it was 
true that he was drugged, his tol- 
erance for the drug was increasing. 
Or perhaps, if this were a dream, 
his subconscious was dredging up 
more detail to satisfy his conscious 
mind. Everything moved with ele- 
phantine slowness. Even in that 
slow progression there were curious 
gaps. 

Perhaps the summer day was 
more humid and the old air-con- 
ditioners in the back windows could 
not keep up. They chuffed con- 
tinuously, but the arms of his chair 
had a slick, moist feel to them. 
The room smelled oddly — acrid 
and musky, with human sweat from 
the bodies packed closely together, 
a little musty like decaying wood, 
and over it all the bite of burning 
incense. 

Events had moved along in the 



courtroom, Wilson became aware. 
He had the impression that wit- 
nesses had been sitting in the chair 
to the right of the judge’s bench 
and that they had been talking 
about him and a fire. 

A university had been burned. 
Not just a building or two but the 
entire fifty or so structures. Now 
on top of the hill where once red 
roofs had been glimpsed from afar 
could be seen only black ruins. A 
janitor who had worked at the 
university testified, under the in- 
sistent questioning of the district 
attorney, that there had been late 
meetings in the offices he cleaned. 
He had overheard talk about set- 
ting fires, and he had retrieved 
from wastebaskets rough plans of 
the university buildings on which 
had been written the words “gaso- 
line” or “thermite.” The district 
attorney offered the papers in evi- 
dence. 

Youngman objected occasional- 
ly. Usually he was overuled. He 
asked to have the identification of 
the handwriting verified by an in- 
dependent expert and was refused. 

The dark-haired young man be- 
side the district attorney who look- 
ed familiar to Wilson, in a dream- 
like way, said nothing. Sometimes 
he smiled at Wilson. Occasionally 
he leaned over to whisper to the 
district attorney or to motion with 
his head at the cameras. Then the 
district attorney would ask the wit- 
ness a question or make a motion. 



TRIAL BY FIRE 



77 




Then there was a student on the 
stand who said- something about 
discussions in class concerning the 
ignorance of the common man and 
how easily he was misled. He had 
reported the discussions to the local 
committee on academic practices. 
He also had made tape recordings 
of the discussion and of the teach- 
er’s lectures. He had recorded talk 
in class about the university burn- 
ings, too, and whether they would 
turn the people against the Senate 
Subcommittee on Academic 
Practices and, indeed, the whole 
Lowbrow movement. 

Tt all was vaguely familiar, like 
an old dream, and about as 
important. 

Wilson gazed idly around the 
room again. Four old light fixtures 
hung from the tall ceiling. Some 
of the ceiling tiles were sagging. 
The air-conditioners were thin, old 
window units placed high in four 
tall windows at the back of the_ 
room, behind the cameras. 

Suddenly he could not see as 
well. The room had darkened. Films 
were being shown at the front of the 
room. 

The scene was in a classroom, and 
mostly the films showed a single 
person, the teacher, at the head of 
the room. He should know the 
teacher, Wilson thought ... Of 
course. It was himself. He felt good 
to realize that he had a piece of 
himself back; he had been a teach- 



er. He had not been particularly 
good at it, though. 

He looked rather ridiculous up 
there talking about things like the 
sociological significance of protest 
and the psychological content of 
lynching, about the values of the 
Lowbrow movement and the hypoc- 
risy of Senator Bartlett and his 
Subcommittee, about the importance 
of the scientific method and the 
necessity for the detachment of 
the scientist. 

The film was dull, and the lec- 
ture was dull and pointlessly pon- 
tificial, saying nothing repetitively. 
Wilson felt Youngman’s elbow 
glance into his ribs and heard the 
lawyer mutter something. He nod- 
ded and stared past the screen at 
the front of the room. There were 
two doors, one on either side of 
the judge’s bench. The one on the 
judge’s right had a frosted win- 
dow; in the other the glass was 
clear. 

The judge had just come through 
the door on his right; the recorder, 
who was in charge of a complicated 
device just in front of the bench, 
had come through the door with 
the clear glass. 

Wilson turned farther to his right. 
Behind him, Wilson was fascinated 
to discover, was another group of 
chairs — about a dozen, similar to 
those on the opposite side of the 
room for the jury. Only this side 
had no wooden back or platform to 
raise the second row of chairs. 



78 



IP 




People were sitting in the chairs. 
They were dressed in ragged suits, 
most of them, with blue open-col- 
lared shirts beneath their coats. 
One face in particular drew Wil- 
son’s gaze. It was a face a little like 
that of an Old Testament prophet 
with a boyish, unruly mop of hair 
and eyes that looked at Wilson as 
if he were an object. Wilson looked 
at the man for a long time before 
the man looked away. Wilson de- 
cided that he knew the man, but 
he could not remember from where. 

Above the heads of the people 
sitting behind him were a group of 
large pictures hung in two rows on 
the wall. They were in oak frames 
of assorted sizes. Four of the men 
pictured in them had beards; three 
of the other four had mustaches. 

That made it seven to one in 
favor of face hair, Wilson thought. 
He felt his chin. He was clean- 
shaven, though he did not remem- 
ber shaving. 

en he turned his gaze to 
the front of the room, the 
films were more exciting. They were 
color films of a great fire. Buildings 
were burning, big ones with pillars 
and towers, built of stone and 
brick. Some of them were ruins of 
rubble and glowing coals, others 
were melting islands in a sea of 
flame. 

If one looked closely one could 
see, as Wilson saw, black stick 
figures running in front of the 



flames, back and forth, back and 
forth . until the realization came 
that they were not in front of the 
flames but in them, and they were 
consumed. It was the old nightmare. 
Wilson remembered it now with all 
its horror. 

He moaned. “Sylvia! ” he said be- 
neath his breath. “Sammy 1” 

The fog lifted a little from his 
brain and allowed the pain to lance 
through. Even as he watched the 
terrible scenes he remembered so 
well, he knew there was something 
he should do, something he had for- 
gotten to do, something he must 
remember to do. 

Then there was a face on the 
screen, a face painted with scarlet 
fingers, a face satanic in expression, 
a face trying to hide, it seemed, 
behind an unbuttoned shirt collar 
and a coat collar turned up. It was 
another familiar face. He knew that 
face. It was his own. 

It was the face of guilt. He shrank 
from it. He turned his head away 
from it and met the gaze of Young- 
man at his side. Youngman’s eyes 
were on him, asking him to do some- 
thing, but Wilson’s head was too 
filled with pain. Across from him 
the dark young man was looking 
at him, too, his lips curled in % 
mockery of a smile, his face chang- 
ed by the scarlet reflections from 
the screen into a kind of devil’s 
mask, not unlike Wilson’s face there 
in the film. Behind him, Wilson had 
the feeling, other eyes were staring.

He stood up, swaying on his feet, 
and put his hand to his throat. He 
felt as if he were choking. There 
was a tie there, although he didn’t 
remember putting on a tie. He felt 
his shoulders. He wore a coat. He 
ran his fingers tremblingly along 
the lapels. Suddenly he jerked them 
away with an exclamation of pain. 

As the lights went up in the 
courtroom, he was standing at the 
table, looking down at his hand. 
There was blood on his right hand 
and more blood welling from a cut 
on his right index finger. Youngman 
reached out his handkerchief to 
staunch the flow of blood and got 
some on the sleeve of his coat. 

The television cameras were star- 
ing at him. Wilson looked guiltily 
into their lenses. 

IV 

'T'he room was on the third floor 
of a 28 -stoiy building located in 
the heart of the old city. It was on 
the third floor because the elevators 
had stopped working long ago and 
there was no point in climbing when 
so many comparable rooms were 
available on low levels all around 
the city. 

The city was thinly populated 
now, supported only by the desul- 
tory activities of the Emperor and 
his authorities. Those activities had 
to be located where the old highway 
systems focused, where river traffic 
was possible and where an occas- 



ional steam-powered locomotive 
could tug in a string of decrepit cars 
on the rusty rails. 

The room was large, but a cor- 
roded metal counter divided it in 
half. Wilson stood on the window 
side of the counter, where only a 
battered desk and a few rickety 
chairs cluttered the marble floors. 
The walk, too, were faced with mar- 
ble higher than his head. A pot- 
bellied iron stove stood near a win- 
dow where its black chimney pipe 
could snake through the shattered 
glass patched with plywood scav- 
enged from somewhere eke. The 
stove was cold now in the heat of 
the summer, but the room was cool. 

The dark young man sat behind 
the desk, watching him. Wilson 
stood in front of the desk, waiting, 
hk hands still chained behind him. 

“So,” the young man said finally, 
“you are a witch.” 

“That is what people call me.” 
“But you are not a witch.” 

“I am many things. To people 
who call me a witch, I am a witch. 
I have strange powers with which 
to control the natural world. I can 
do things that others cannot do, 
things they cannot even understand. 
For thk they respect me; for my 
services in their behalf they some- 
times pay me. I am their mediator 
between the goodness of life that 
they want and the evil in life that 
keeps them from having it.” 

“You are an educated man who 
uses the old science to delude the 



80 



IF 




people. The Emperor wants to know 
where you got your learning, and 
he wants to know where you got 
your building and equipment and 
now it is defended and where you 
get your supplies.” 

"The Emperor wants to know a 
great deal. That is the beginning 
of education.” 

"It is not wise to joke about the 
Emperor,” the young man said. 

"I do not joke,” Wilson said. 

CCHphe Emperor does not want 
education,” the young man 
snapped. "He wants information. 
He will get it from you.” He set- 
tled back in his chair. "You have 
succeeded in stirring me once, 
against my will. If you succeed 
again you will be a clever man. 
Too clever to be allowed to exist. 
We will tye put to the trouble of 
finding another witch.” 

"I would not willingly trouble 
anyone.” 

"You would be wise especially 
not to trouble the head of the Em- 
peror’s secret police.” 

"You are young for such emi- 
nence.” 

The young man smiled. "There 
is no age requirement for compe- 
tence.” 

"Nor for ambition. And what is 
this competent young man’s 
name?” 

"You may call me ‘Captain.’ ” 

"You do think of me as a witch, 
a little, Captain.” 



"And why do you say that?" 
"You do not give me your name. 
Is it because, after all, you believe 
that if I know your name I might 
have power over you?” 

"Peasant superstition.” 

"And yet—?” 

"You will not taunt me into re- 
vealing my name to you. I think 
you have no power. And yet who 
knows what power the old science 
may give you? A prudent man — 
But you are clever 1 I have brought 
you here to answer my questions, 
and you have me answering yours. 
In the end it will avail you nothing, 
however. You will answer my ques- 
tions.” 

"And then?” 

"If you are cooperative the Em- 
peror may choose to be merciful.” 
"The Emperor’s mercy is well 
known. But I am a man who lives 
by reason. If I cooperate I will 
need to be convinced that my co- 
operation is merited. You will have 
to answer my questions.” 

"Ask your questions,” the young 
man said, shrugging. 

"Why does the Emperor sudden- 
ly interest himself in the villages?” 
"The Emperor is interested in 
every part of his empire.” 

"But he has not interfered in the 
internal affairs of the villages for 
a decade. That was when the 
last witch-hunt ended in failure.” 
"So I have heard. But this is 
not a witch-hunt. What is one witch 
more or less?”

Wilson stood squarely in front 
of the young man, not shifting his 
weight, his shoulders pulled back 
by the chains binding his wrists. 
“Don’t the villagers pay their 
taxes?” 

“Only when soldiers are sent for 
them, and even then there is not 
much. A few trinkets. But no coins. 
And grain and livestock are too 
bulky for soldiers to carry.” 

“The villagers have little need 
for money.” 

“Thanks to you and your fellow 
witches. They have only to ask for 
help and you give it to them. How 
can they develop their initiative, 
their ability to help themselves?” 
“And yet we keep the villages 
peaceful, the villagers happy. Sure- 
ly the Emperor counts this a bless- 
ing. There have been no uprisings.” 
“How can sheep rebel? We are 
an annoyance to them. We should 
be indispensable.” 

“As are their witches,” Wilson 
said simply. “The Emperor be- 
grudges us that.” 

nphe Emperor begrudges nothing. 

-*• He rules an empire stretching 
from St. Louis to Denver. It is the 
largest and greatest empire in the 
world, but it is only a shadow of 
what it might be. You and your 
fellow witches keep it feeble. In- 
stead of sturdy, ambitious subjects, 
he has villages of listless farmers. 
Instead of a bustling empire filled 
with the sound of factories turning 



out goods for export, be has a land 
that is content to listen to the com 
growing. How long before suck a 
nation is conquered by its neigh- 
bors?” 

“What difference would it make 
to the villagers?” 

“It would make a difference to 
the Emperor. And it would make 
a difference to the villagers if they 
had the ambition to improve their 
lots, to produce for trade instead of 
consumption, to move their excess 
populations to the dries where they 
can put the factories to work again, 
revive the mines, repair the refin- 
eries, get the economy going... ” 
“Back to the machines?” Wilson 
diook his head. “Your Emperor’s 
predecesors did their job too well. 
A hatred of machines is bred into 
the people. They cannot go back.” 
“You give them machines.” 
“Those are not machines. They 
are magic. The people are not tied 
to them. They are to serve, not to 
be served.” 

“The people won’t go back as 
long as you and your fellow witches 
give them the benefits of the mach- 
ine without responsibility for It 
The Emperor calls you the opiate 
of the people.” 

The young man’s eyes smoldered. 
“It is you witches who oppress the 
people. Once relieved of your crutch 
they will find that they never 
heeded you. They will have to re- 
turn to the dries; they will have 
to return to progress.” 

IF,

Wilson chuckled softly to himself. 

“You laugh?” the young man 
asked incredulously. 

“At the irony. First you destroy 
science and the machines science 
built, and then you struggle to get 
them back. It is all a matter of 
leverage for those who wield power 

— or want to.” 

“There would be no struggle if it 
were not for you. Our Emperor has 
the interests of the people in his 
heart; he wants to see them happy 
and prospering. He does not want 
them ground under the heel of a 
conqueror.” 

“Does someone threaten war?” 
Wilson asked. “That is hard to be- 
lieve. Conditions are much the same 
everywhere. Only a few young men 

— who cannot master the teachings 
or the way of life of the villages, 
or who grow up untutored in the 
city’s ruins — become soldiers. 
There are too few to fight a war 
of conquest. There is not enough 
transportation or enough material. 
But perhaps it is the Emperor who 
grows restless. Would he like to ex- 
pand his empire? Is it he who plans 
a war of conquest?” 

The young man looked at Wilson 
with hard eyes and unmoving face. 
“Enough of your questions. Now 
you will answer mine.” 

“Ask.” 

“Where did you get your knowl- 
edge?” 

“I was educated in a village not 
far from here.” 



tiX^ou did not learn all yon know 
* in a village school,” fte 
young man said sharply. “We have 
questioned villagers, and they have 
an interesting amount of misinfor- 
mation and information of little 
value to them or anyone else. But 
they are filled with superstition. 
And they do not know how to heal 
the sick or how to make the land 
fertile or how to repair their mach- 
ines when they stop working.” 
“When I was a young man,” Wil- 
son said, his eyes reminiscent, 
“there still were universities. I 
learned many things in one of them 
but more in the villages. I traveled 
from village to village working, 
talking to the people, learning from 
them. Eventually, by contempla- 
tion and perseverance, I found my 
way to truth.” 

“What is truth?” 

“You will pardon me, Captain,” 
Wilson said, as he moved slowly to- 
ward the unbroken window pane 
that was left and looked out into 
the street three floors below. It was 
cluttered with debris from the 
building opposite, which had been 
burned out before, and with rusted 
vehicles of various kinds, now little 
more than mounds of ore. A path 
wide enough for a wagon had been 
created in the center of the old 
street. Otherwise the street was the 
way it had been left when the city 
was abandoned by all except the 
scavengers. The street was empty 
and silent.

“If I could tell you what I 
found,” Wilson said, turning back 
to the young man at the desk, “I 
would not have had to go to seek 
it. No one could tell me. At best 
I could only be prepared to find it 
and to know it when I found it and 
was ready to accept it. What is 
truth? I cannot tell you, Captain. 
I can only tell you where to find 
it.” 

“Where will I find it?” 

“Among the people and in your 
heart and mind. It is the secret of 
the people’s survival and their fit- 
ness to survive. It is what the people 
must be to survive and how they 
must be selected if they are to 
evolve.” 

“All this is the superstition you 
feed the villagers to keep them 
under your spell,” the young man 
said impatiently. “What is it you 
found? Where did you get your 
knowledge?” 

“This is not something you can 
pass along like a multiplication 
table, Captain. You must find it 
for yourself, with humility and an 
open mind.” 

“Rubbish! Where do you get 
your buildings? Where do you get 
your supplies?” 

“From those who also have found 
truth.” 

The young man sat in his chair 
looking at Wilson. “You will tell 
me these things,” he said at last. 
“We have some of the old drugs 
that are reputed to loosen tongues. 



And if these have lost their powers 
we can try methods more physical. 
And when you have told us all 
we wish to know, you will go on 
trial as a witch.” 

“How will you try me,” Wilson 
asked, “when you already have 
judged me?” 

“Sergeant,” the young man call- 
ed out. The leader of the pla- 
toon came through the doorway 
followed by two of hfe soldiers. 

The young man smiled. “By fire, 
witch. How else?” 

V 

A woman was sitting in the wit- 
ness chair when the courtroom 
swam back into Wilson’s conscious- 
ness. Except for her the room was 
just as it had been before — the 
jury, the two men at the table 
opposite, Youngman beside him, 
the stone-faced audience, the peer- 
ing eyes of the television cameras, 
the men sitting behind him under 
the pictures of the eight old men, 
seven of them with beards or 
mustaches. 

It had the recurring quality of a 
nightmare, but it moved along. 
Which was real he wondered fuz- 
zily. Was he the witch-doctor in a 
world of villagers being put to 
the question and dreaming of a 
world in which science was being 
repudiated? Or was he a scientist 
on trial for burning a university 
and dreaming of a world in which 



84 



IF 




the scientist was a respected and 
beloved helper of the people?, 

He could not decide. He knew, 
though, which one he hoped was 
real — and this was not it. 

There were so many things he 
did not know. He did not know 
whether he was guilty, as this 
vaguely familiar woman in the chair 
seemed to be saying. The lawyer 
who was defending him — he had 
said Wilson was not guilty. But 
that was what lawyers always said, 
wasn’t it? Or else there would be 
few trials. 

The district attorney was asking 
the woman questions about the 
evening the university had burned. 
“You saw the defendant that eve- 
ning, Mrs. Craddock?” 

“He was at our house. We had 
dinner, and he said — ” 

“Who is this man? Can you 
identify him for us, Mrs. Crad- 
dock?” 

“John Wilson,” Mrs. Craddock 
said. “That man sitting there,” she 
said, pointing. 

She was an attractive woman, 
Wilson thought, but an unattrac- 
tive emotion was distorting her 
features. Was it hatred? 

“The defendant?” 

“Yes. He said Harvard had 
burned and CalTech had burned, 
and the University would be next.” 
“And by ‘the University , he 
meant — ?” 

“We all knew what he meant 
The university he worked for.” 



“And why did he think the 
University would be next?” 

“He didn't say, but he gave us 
the impression that it was inevit- 
able. That it was already deter- 
mined.” 

“That it was planned?” 

“Yes.” 

“That it would be soon?” 

“Yes.” 

“And did you get the impression 
from the defendant that he had 
been part of the planning?” 

“Yes — ” 

Youngman objected, and the 
judge ordered it stricken from the 
record, but the audience had heard 
it — and it stirred them to an 
animal moan. The television view- 
ers had heard it. And most of all, 
the jurors had heard it. They were 
ready to declare him guilty on the 
spot, Wilson felt As a matter of 
fact, he was ready to admit his 
own guilt If he could only remem- 
ber I 

He half rose in his chair. 
“Emily?” he began. “Emily — ?” 
And he could not continue, because 
the thought had comb to him that 
the name of the woman on the wit- 
ness stand was “Emily,” and he 
had remembered that much — an 
evening when he had eaten at a 
table with Emily and someone 
named Mark and two children 
named Amy and Junior, and he had 
said something like the things that 
Emily had said. Only it was not 
quite right. 



86 



IF 




[T Te stood there in front of the 
j ur y and the audience and the 
television eyes, and it was like an 
admission of guilt that he should 
speak the woman’s name but say 
no more but he could not think of 
what else to say but “EMILY.” 
The woman he knew by that name 
frowned and unconsciously bit her 
lower lip. The dark young man 
who sat at the table opposite him 
and bad not yet spoken aloud 
braced his hands upon his chair as 
if he were about to rise. 

“Sit down, Mr. Wilson!” the 
judge ordered. “You may not inter- 
rupt the trial. If you wish to be 
heard, you must appear as a wit- 
ness.” 

Youngman’s hand touched Wil- 
son’s arm, and Wilson sank back to 
his seat, bemused. 

After Youngman’s cross-exam- 
ination, unshaken but with apparent 
relief, Mrs. Craddock was allowed 
to leave the witness chair. She was 
followed to the chair by others. A 
man identified as a desk clerk at a 
downtown hotel testified that on 
the night of the fire he had seen 
the defendant get off a bus from 
this town, make a telephone call 
and then register at the hotel under 
the name of “Gerald Perry” and 
with the occupation of “salesman 
from Rochester, N.Y.” He had left 
in the middle of the night. No one 
had seen him go. 

A seedy middle-aged man said 
that he had been paid by Wilson 

TRIAL BY FIRE 



to pick up a package addressed to 
Wilson at General Delivery and 
then to toss it behind a bush as 
he left the post office. Immediate- 
ly afterward he had been accosted 
by detectives who were hunting for 
Wilson but by the time they had 
returned to the spot Wilson had 
fled. 

An old man testified that a man 
who looked like Wilson had bought 
a hearing aid from him for $239.95 
on the day following the fire, and a 
young man, who had clerked at that 
time in an electronics parts store, 
said that on the day following the 
fire Wilson had paid him $153 for 
parts and the use of a workroom 
and tools. 

A broad-shouldered, thick-neck- 
ed man with a nose that had been 
broken sometime in the recent jpast 
identified himself as an investi- 
gator for the Senate Subcommittee 
on Academic Practices and testified 
that he had picked up Wilson in 
New Orleans as Wilson was about 
to sell his services to an agent for 
the government of Brazil, along 
with whatever secrets he had in 
his possession. 

X^oungman objected again. 
* ^ - “What is the relevance of 
the testimony of these witnesses to 
the crime of which my client is 
accused? These actions are read- 
ily interpreted as those of a mqn 
in great fear of his personal safety. 
As who would not be if he had 

a 7 




seen his university burned and his 
friends slain by a mob? I ask that 
all this testimony be struck from 
the record, and that the jury be 
asked to disregard it.” 

The judge looked at the district 
attorney, and the blocky man 
turned to the dark young man be- 
side him. The young man whispered 
in the district attorney’s ear, his 
hand cupped in front of his mouth. 

“Your honor,” said the district 
attorney, rising to his feet, “I am 
shocked at the attorney for the 
defense accusing the people of this 
state and of this nation of mob 
actions. I would remind the court 
and the attorney that they are not 
on trial. The witnesses who have 
appeared before this court have 
painted a picture of a man whose 
actions are not those of an innocent 
person who had only to enter the 
nearest police station if he needed 
protection. He could there have 
entered a complaint against others 
if he felt they were responsible for 
this tragic event. Instead he as- 
sumed a false name, persuaded 
others to act for him under sus- 
picious circumstances, obtained de- 
vices for which he had no legal use 
and attempted to slip illegally out 
of the country. These are the actions 
of a man ridden with guilt and try- 
ing to evade the natural conseq- 
quences for his actions — ” 

“Your honor,” Youngman said, 
half-rising, “the district attorney is 
making a speech.” 

•t 



“All the testimony given today 
is pertinent, your honor,” the dis- 
trict attorney said. “And it will 
lead to other revelations.” 

“Will it lead to the revelation,” 
Youngman asked, “that I have not 
been permitted to consult with my 
client since his arrest, an official 
action which prejudices the entire 
trial and which will be called to 
the attention of the appellate 
court as soon as this trial is coi *- 
cluded?” 

“Are you raising an objection, 
Mr. Youngman?” the judge asked 
evenly. 

“I am objecting to the entire 
nature and structure of this trial,” 
Youngman said clearly. “It is a; 
farce to think that this man can 
defend himself without consulta- 
tion. This man has not even been 
allowed to see his wife since his 
imprisonment. If this state of 
affairs continues, if my client is 
prevented from communicating with 
his lawyer and his family, I will 
refuse to let my client take the 
stand, and we will appeal this case 
to the highest court.” 

The jury stirred. The audience 
groaned. A blonde young woman 
stood up in the audience and 
screamed. Then, putting the back 
of her hand to her lips, she crum- 
pled to the floor. 

How fascinating, Wilson thought. 
Was that woman his wife? She 
looked familiar all right. He had 
seen her before. She looked like the 



IF 




Pat Helman of his dream — or his 
dream of the Pat Helman of his 
real existence. 

VI 

VT7ilson’s senses were numb, but 

* * the very numbness seemed to 
enhance his subconscious aware- 
ness. He had, for instance, a feeling 
that he was in a building of im- 
mense size. The room itself was 
relatively small. The walls were 
stone, and a stone fireplace with 
a marble mantle was built into the 
far wall. Several old tubular metal 
chairs with leatherette upholstery 
were placed neatly against the 
walls. A single tall window broke 
the wall at his right: it was lat- 
ticed with metal bars. A thick door- 
way was to his left. Beyond it were 
two uniformed guards, and beyond 
them was a peering lens mounted 
on a tripod. It made a muted, 
whirring noise. 

Besides the feeling of massive 
size, Wilson also sensed a strong 
institutional odor of soap and anti- 
septic. In addition he sensed, near- 
er, a more subtle fragrance that he 
had not smelled for a long time, for 
many months. It brought back 
memories of a girl driving a long 
Cadillac Turbojet 500, a girl with 
bright golden hair like a scarf tug- 
ging at her head, with blue eyes 
and warm lips and a throat like a 
white column. 

He was not surprised that she 

TRIAL BY FIRE 



was sitting beside him, but then 
Httle seemed . to surprise him. 
“You’ve — you’ve cut — your hair/’ 
he got out Her hair was straight 
and short now, not much longer 
than a man’s, with soft bangs 
across her forehead. But she was as 
lovely as ever. She dressed more 
sedately than his errant memory 
recalled. 

“Yes, darling,” she said. “I’m an 
old married lady now.” She held 
out a left hand with a thick gold 
ring on it. 

“Married?” he echoed. 

“Oh, what have they done to 
you?” she wailed. And she threw 
herself at him. Her arms went 
around his neck. Her head buried 
itself in the hollow between his 
neck and his shoulder, and he felt 
something sting the back of his 
neck. “To you, John Wilson,” she 
whispered in his ear. He straight- 
ened, and for a moment the clouds 
in his head parted. “I’m sorry,” she 
said an instant later as she pulled 
hair. “I lost control of myself. I 
promised myself I wouldn’t do that. 
You have enough to worry about 
without that, I said.” 

He looked at her, trying to re- 
member. Her name was Pat Helman. 
Maybe. Or perhaps it was Pat Wil- 
son, Mrs. John Wilson. But surely 
he would be more certain about his 
wife. He was on trial for something 
to do with the burning of a univer- 
sity. He remembered that. And now 
he must be in prison where he was 

19 




bang visited by this woman who 
said die was his wife. 

She had been talking for several 
minutes, and he had not been lis- 
tening, he realized guiltily. He tried 
to concentrate on what she was say- 
ing. 

“You must try to understand, 
Johnny. They let one of us visit 
you. Only one. It’s just for show, 
of course, but Charley and I — 
that’s Charley Youngman, your 
lawyer — decided that we couldn’t 
pass up the opportunity. We talked 
it over and decided I should come, 
that maybe I could get through to 
you better. 

“You’re on trial for your life, 
Johnny. They’ll hang you for 
sure if you don’t do something. 
As payment for this visit we’ve 
agreed to let you take the witness 
stand in your own defense. But 
you’ve got to snap out of it or 
they’ll cut you up!” 

fT^he fog was beginning to drift 
away, he thought. 

A moment later he was sure of it. 
First came the stab of remem- 
brance like a flaming sword. The 
flames spread until they ate away 
a great and beautiful university and 
then consumed its beating heart, 
the men and women who taught 
and studied there, friends of his, 
colleagues, and one who was more 
than a friend. The pain made his 
eyes lower to his hands where they 
rested motionless bn his legs like 

90 



huge paralyzed white spiders. 

“You’re not guilty, Johnny,” the 
blonde girl was saying, “but you’re 
acting as if you were. And that’s 
the same thing.” 

No, he wasn’t guilty. He remem- 
bered now the way it was. He had 
returned to the university too late, 
returned from a dinner with his 
friends, Emily and Mark Craddock, 
in the city — Emily, who had re- 
pudiated him to save her family 
and had twisted the truth about 
him on the witness stand so that 
her family could be secure. He had 
returned too late to see the blaze 
begin, but he had seen it in its 
greatest fury. And he had seen the 
mob who had done it, and the faces 
of the mob, turned demonic by 
flames and something else worse 
than demons. 

He had not been too late for the 
r unnin g of the egg-heads, for the 
silent crowds that waited at the 
exits of the university with clubs 
and pitchforks and axes for the 
black figures that ran in front of 
the flames and the casual young- 
sters who used them for target 
practice like clay pigeons at a skeet 
shoot. He had seen a sight like that 
once. When he was a boy he and 
some friends had fired an old grain 
bin to kill the rats as they came 
out. 

“The time is almost up,” the girl 
said. “They’ve given us only half 
an hour. You’re going to be all 
right. I know it, now.” 



IF 




Yes, he was going to be all right 
if he could only keep remembering 
and not forget. He could remember 
the terror and desperation of the 
long escape to New Orleans, aided 
by the brain-wave detector he had 
gimmicked together out of a hearing 
aid, some electronic parts and an 
antenna he had sewn into his coat. 
They had traced his every step, 
these people who were trying him 
for the crimes of all scientists. 
The only facts they did not have 

— or at least that they had not 
revealed yet — were this girl be- 
side him, who was not, he thought 
regretfully, Mrs. Wilson, and the 
shadowy organization die repre- 
sented. 

She had picked him up on the 
highway after he had left the train 
at Alexandria and his second-hand 
car had given up. “Fm old Tim 
Helman’s only child,” she had said, 
“and I have a guilt complex a run- 
way long.” 

He knew who Tim Helman was. 
He was the financier who had put 
his money and the money of mil- 
lions of others into commercial 
rocketports and artificial satellites. 
He was the man who had lost it all 
when the Lowbrow movement came 
along and the government revoked 
his subsidies before the complex 
could start paying off. He was the 
man who had died of a heart attack 

— it was announced as a heart at- 
tack — before he could be brought 
to trial for fraud under a blue-sky 



law that was, for once, aptly named. 

Wilson had not been in the mood 
to trust anyone, and he had leaped 
from the car at the first oppor- 
tunity. 

Weeks later he made contact with 
a man named Fuentes, a represen- 
tative of the Brazilian government, 
who offered him a chance to work 
there, not at his own research but 
at tasks that would be assigned 
him. He realized that there was no 
place left where a scientist could 
pursue truth in the old unfettered 
fashion. The question was academ- 
ic, in any case. Agents of the 
Subcommittee on Academic Prac- 
tices had been watching Fuentes. 
Wilson literally had fallen into their 
laps only to be rescued, in turn, 
by Pat Helman and a man named 
Pike. 

They had convinced him that 
he and his fellow scientists were 
as blindly wrong in their pursuit 
of inhuman truth as the mobs who 
made up the Lowbrow movement 
were wrong in their massacre of the 
scientists. He had gone to live with 
the people, to see if he could be- 
come one of them instead of an egg- 
head walled off by an impene- 
trable shell of superiority, to de- 
termine if he could learn from 
them what they were trying to com- 
municate by violence. 

T itellectually he had under- 
stood before he joined them. 
He had accepted the idea that the 



TRIAL BY FIRE

ordinary citizen whose skills were 
being outmoded by galloping auto- 
mation several times in his life had 
grown terrified. The ordinary cit- 
izen felt that his fate was beyond 
his control; it had been placed in 
the hands of others, distant and 
unconcerned, who did things that 
he could not do with powers he 
could not understand and who pre- 
tended that anyone could do these 
things if they wanted to and tried 
hard enough, who pursued their 
mysterious ends without thought of 
human consequences and with only 
casual attempts to communicate to 
laymen what it was they were try- 
ing to do and why. 

He had understood with his mind 
that the little man, in his terror of 
bombs and rockets and machines, 
had despaired of attracting the at- 
tention of the scientists by tugging 
a their sleeves. So he had given 
the scientists the same troubles he 
had, insecurity and the fear of sud- 
den death, in the subconscious hope 
that he could learn from the efforts 
of the scientists to solve that prob- 
lem. And they had learned nothing 
— except that scientists died like 
other men and fled from danger 
like other men. Still they had killed 
them and chased them because 
if they could not help the people 
at least they could not hurt them 
either. 

Now Wilson understood these 
matters emotionally as well, and he 
thought he understood the people. 



He understood their need for a 
scapegoat to take the blame for 
their sins, and he also understood 
their desires for someone better 
than themselves to represent 
their finest aspirations. He had 
given himself up as one or the 
other. 

What was it to be? 

“Oh, Johnny,” said Pat Helman, 
whose name was not Wilson and 
never had been and perhaps never 
would be. 

“It’s all up to you, and I’ve 
got to go now. I may never see 
you again.” Once more she threw 
herself at him, and again she whis- 
pered against his ear. “We didn’t 
mean for you to give yourself up, 
you idiot! We can’t get you out of 
here or that courtroom either. All 
we can do is give you the antidote 
to the drugs. Which I’ve done. You 
mustn’t let on though, or they’ll 
never put you on the stand, and 
your martyrdom might as well pay 
off in one moment of glory.” And 
then she pulled herself away. 
“Good-by Johnny. Good-by.” 

He was left alone in the little 
room, staring after her, staring in- 
to the eye of the camera which had 
recorded this touching moment of 
reunion between a notorious crim- 
inal and his wife, through official 
generosity, and he dulled his eyes 
and let them sink to his hands as 
the guards came and led him un- 
resisting down the echoing corridors 
to his cell.

nphe words in the relentless 

■*“ whisper echoed in his ears, 
“You are a witch, a witch, a witch. 
Where do you get your wit, your 
wit, your wit?” The echo was in- 
side his head, which was a great 
empty space. 

He opened his eyes and saw 
nothing. At first he thought that 
he was blind. Then, as a shadow 
pirouetted across the ceiling, he 
realized that the cell was lit by a 
single candle in the comer. He 
could not summon the will to look 
at it but he knew it was there by 
the shadows. 

He was lying on crumbling ce- 
ment. He could feel it dusty be- 
neath his hands. From the musty 
smell of the place it might be an 
underground room, perhaps a room 
in the same old City Hall in which 
he had talked with the young man 
who called himself Captain. 

“Who are you? What is your 
name?” came the whisper again. 

“John Wilson,” he said with dif- 
ficulty but with precision. He did 
not need to look. The dark young 
man was seated on the cement be- 
side him. 

“John Wilson,” the young man 
said, “you will tell me what I need 
to know.” 

“I will tell you — what you need 
to know,” Wilson repeated. The 
words were the same but the mean- 
ing somehow was different 



The young man felt it, too. “You 
will tell me what I wish to know.” 
“I will tell you — what you need 
to know,” Wilson said. 

“Where did you get your edu- 
cation?” came the whisper. 

“Part of it — before the destruc- 
tion — of the machines.” 

“But that would make you, more 
than one hundred years old!” the 
young man snapped. Wilson did not 
say anything. It was not a question. 
“Are you more than one hundred 
years old?” 

“Yes.” 

“That’s ridiculous! You do not 
look more than middle aged.” 
Again there was silence. “How can 
such things be?” 

“Much is possible — for men 
who had found truth,” Wilson got 
out. “Disease is unnecessary. Aging 
can be delayed.” 

The young man was silent again. 
Perhaps he was absorbing the im- 
plications of the information he had 
received. What would the Emperor 
give for the secret of longevity? 
What could the young man him- 
self do with another half century 
or more of vigorous life in which to 
get ahead in the world? It might 
change his entire outlook upon his 
career; he might not have to take 
shortcuts to win success while he 
still could enjoy its fruits. 

T he silence endured until Wil- 
son was afraid he would fall 
back into the cavern made his

head. But he dung to consciousness 
as if it were the edge of a cliff. 
Next time he might not have so 
firm a grip on his cavern — on his 
mind. 

“Are you telling the truth?” 
“Can I tell — anything else?” 
“Always you answer a question 
with a question. Why?” 

“That is the nature of man — 
and the nature of life. There are no 
final answers — only new ques- 
tions.” 

“Mystidsm! The answers I want 
are not so difficult. Where did you 
get the rest of your education?.” 
“Everywhere.” 

“Are you a witch?” 

“To some.” 

“Where are your fellow witches?” 
“In the villages.” 

“Where do they get their sup- 
port?” 

“From the villages.” 

“They do not get their machines 
from the villages nor their supplies. 
Where is the witch world? Where 
is the place that witches learn their 
craft? Where do they get their 
machines?” 

“The witch world — co-exists 
with the empire — and with all 
other kingdoms and empires — of 
the world.” 

“Where else is it?” 

“Wherever man can exist.” 

“And where is that?” 
“Everywhere.” 

“You are evading my questions. 
Have you the will to do that?” 



“The will — and the capability.” 
“Then there are other methods 
of persuasion.” 

Distantly Wilson felt his hand 
lifted. The shadows swirled on the 
ceiling above his head. He did not 
feel pain, but in a few moments the 
odor of cooking meat drifted to his 
nostrils. 

“A foretaste of the flames,” the 
young man said. 

“Your measures — combat each 
other.” Wilson said. “I feel nothing. 
Bum away. Or if you would have 
me suffer — you must give me the 
power — to resist.” 

“You devil!” As distantly as it 
was lifted, Wilson felt his hand 
dropped. The shadows danced once 
more across the ceiling. “Why did 
you let yourself be captured?” 

“If not me then another.” 

“The villagers could have re- 
sisted. They could have overcome 
us.” 

“They are peaceful folk. Vio- 
lence breeds more violence. Other 
soldiers would come. So long as 
the Emperor is content — to rule 
the body without coercing the 
spirit — the Empire will exist and 
the people will obey it. The life 
the people have — is beyond the 
realm of the Emperor.” 

“You are speaking nonsense 
again,” the young man said, but 
he said it absently. “Would you 
like your right hand to match your 
left? Let me tell you what the 
Emperor has in mind. If the witches 



P4 



IE 




would support him with goods and 
machines — and you have them, we 
know — he could soon conquer this 
entire continent Eventually per- 
haps the world itself! All the world 
under one peaceful rule. Think of 
that! And you witches would be 
well repaid.” 

“Sometime in his life every ruler 
has that dream,” Wilson said. “The 
answer is always the same. You 
cannot give us anything we do not 
already have. You can only take 
from the people.” 

“You are an obstinate and short- 
sighted witch!” 

TX7ilson summoned his energies 
* * once more. “You are an in- 
quisitive young man. You wish to 
know. If you had attended a vil- 
lage school you would know much 
already.” 

“I attended the Court School. 
And I learned much there but even 
more at the Court itself. You see 
where it has taken me.” 

“From ignorance to ignorance,” 
Wilson said. “It is not too late. I 
was ten years older than you are 
before my education truly began. 
You still can learn. Go seek the 
truth. What distinguishes half-man 
from animal? What separates man 
from half-man? What will select 
next man from present man?” 
“What should I care about such 
follies? Be still, old man.” 

“You may be next man. But you 
must find your way. You must 



pass the tests. To be fit to survive 
you must survive.” 

“You talk rubbish, old man,” the 
young man said, but he sounded 
uneasy. 

He was thoughtful for a few mo- 
ments and then, Wilson thought, he 
shook himself like a dog coming out 
of a cold bath. “Next man or past 
man, you will bum, old man. We 
will put you to the trial, and then 
you will be dead man.” 

“You do not fear the witch’s 
power?” 

“Let it save you from the flames. 
Perhaps then I will believe in 
witchcraft and your mumbo- 
jumbo.” 

“Then it may be too late. The 
man who can be convinced only by 
a show of force — is lost to reason.” 
“Reason is a weak man’s solace.” 
“Force is a strong man’s refuge.” 
“You will bum brightly!” 

“Bum me brightly then,” Wilson 
said. “Perhaps by my light you 
may see a part of the truth. You 
will not have another chance. I am 
the only witch we will allow the 
Emperor to take.” 

And Wilson loosened his grasp 
and fell back into the cavern and 
dreamed of flames. 

VIH 

TX7llson woke not to the dim 
* * confusion of the courtroom 
but to the pale light of morning 
filtering through tall windows lined 



TRIAL BY FIRE

with bars. His pillow was whisper- 
ing to him, “You are a witch, and 
you have set a fire — a fire which 
destroyed a university and the 
people in it, people who were your 
friends and now are dead ashes. 
You are guilty. You have committed 
arson and murder, and you must 
be punished.” 

More bars were all around him. 
Bars for walls, bars for a door. 
Only above him and below him was 
there something solid — the ceiling 
and the floor were concrete, but 
Wilson felt that inside them, if he 
dug, he would find the same cold, 
gray bars. 

He was in a cell. It was part of a 
block of cells stacked one atop an- 
other and beside another like so 
many houses built of toothpicks, 
but the toothpicks were solid steel. 
Outside his cell was a corridor, and 
beyond that was a stone wall. The 
tall, barred windows were in the 
wall. He was a prisoner held in a 
maximum security prison, and he 
had no more chance of escaping 
than a witch from the deepest In- 
quisitorial dungeon. 

He ran his hand over the rough 
material of the prison blanket that 
covered him, and over the dustily 
astringent odor of mopped concrete 
floors he smelled coffee brewing far 
off. How long had it been since he 
had smelled something so good? 
They had taken that from him, 
and he lay in his bunk, listening 
to his pillow, and enjoyed the smell. 

94 



“You’re awake, eh?” said an in- 
terested voice dose beside him. 
“It’s the first time you’ve been 
awake.” 

Wilson’s eyes slowly drifted shut 
“Oh,” the voice said, disappoint- 
ed. “I guess you ain’t. But if you 
are and don’t want to let on, I want 
to talk to you when you get a 
chance to listen. They say you’re 
a crummy scientist. But you don’t 
seem so bad to me. You just lay 
there, moaning and talking in your 
sleep, and I guess you’re just a 
crummy con like me, and it’s us 
against them. We got something 
working, fellow. If you want a piece 
of it just wiggle your eyelids.” 
Wilson lay very still, breathing 
regularly, listening to his vindictive 
pillow. His eyelids did not move. 

“I don’t blame you, fellow,” said 
the voice beside him. “Why should 
you trust anybody? Maybe when 
they bring you back — if they 
bring you back.” 

*nphey came soon afterwards. Men 
dressed Wilson’s unresisting 
body in newly pressed clothes and 
half carried, half dragged him to 
an armored truck. It had two cots 
in the back, and they placed Wil- 
son on one of them. The truck 
started up. After about ten minutes 
of slow, twisting city driving, the 
truck picked up speed. Twenty 
minutes later it drew up to the back 
of an old brick building. Wilson 
was hustled into a small doorway 

IF 




and up a flight of stairs to the 
courtroom. 

“No one will appear in this man’s 
defense,” Youngman said. “His 
cause is unpopular, and anyone who 
testifies for him will be called 
‘traitor’ by his neighbors, and per- 
haps worse will happen to him. 
Therefore I will call John Wilson 
himself to be the only witness for 
the defense.” 

With great care, as if he were 
walking a tightrope, Wilson made 
his way to the witness chair and 
with Youngman’s aid settled him- 
self into it. Slowly Youngman led 
him through a rebuttal of the testi- 
mony presented by the prosecution. 
Wilson hesitated often and fumbled 
for words, but he finally told his 
story of the events. 

He had returned to find the 
University already in flames, he 
said. He had fled the scene and 
later the area under an assumed 
name for fear that what had hap- 
pened to the others at the Univer- 
sity would happen to him. By the 
time Youngman had finished, they 
had painted a picture of a man 
driven by desperation into a wild 
and sometimes irrational flight for 
his life. 

Youngman turned to the district 
attorney and took his seat. The 
district attorney hesitated for a mo- 
ment, frowning, and then pulled 
himself up. 

“You claim that you returned to 
the University to find it in flames. 



Yet Mrs. Craddock points out 
that you were talking about plans to 
burn it at dinner that evening." 

Wilson straightened a little. “Not 
plans,” he said gently. “The pos- 
sibility of others burning it. And 
by the testimony of your own wit- 
nesses — Mrs. Craddock and the 
officials who noted the time of the 
fire — I left the city after the fire 
already had begun, 35 miles away.” 

The district attorney seemed un- 
able to find an appropriate word. 
He turned halfway toward the 
young man sitting at the table. 
Smoothly the young man got up. 
“Your honor? May I interrogate 
the witness?” 

The voice was familiar. 

The judge nodded. “Of course, 
Mr. Kelley. You have been appoint- 
ed asistant prosecutor for that pur- 
pose.” 

Now Wilson knew him. Leonard 
Kelley was chief investigator for 
Senator Bartlett’s Subcommittee 
on Academic Practices. 

“Mr. Wilson,” Kelley said 
smoothly, “you are, as you know, 
not accused of setting the fire itself 
but of conspiring with others to 
set it. That you were not there to 
put the torch yourself is incidental, 
and you are only trying to confuse 
the jury by pretending otherwise. 
You will not deny that your actions 
following the fire were those of a 
guilty man.” 

“It is a truism that the guilty 
flee when no man pursueth,” Wil-

son said drily, straightening a little 
more. "But it is equally true and 
equally obvious that the wise man, 
w r hen he sees an angry mob ap- 
proaching with a rope, does not 
stop to ask questions.” 

Kelley studied Wilson’s face with 
shrewd, perceptive eyes. "You were 
trying to flee the country entirely 
when you were captured.” 

"A moment of folly. Luckily I 
thought better of it and returned.” 
"You mean you were returned.” 
"No, I returned of my own voli- 
tion, having escaped from the agent 
of the Subcommittee.” 

"You escaped, Wilson? How?” 
"Your colleague lost his head — 
and had his nose somewhat al- 
tered.” 

"And then what did you do, Wil- 
son?” 

"I returned. Three months later 
I gave myself up voluntarily.” 

^phe members of the jury turned 
to each other. The stem-faced 
members of the audience shifted 
positions. 

"What did you do in those three 
months, Wilson?” 

"I lived in small towns, worked 
in the fields and in the shops.” 
"Did you believe that this 
would enable you to escape jus- 
tice?” 

"I knew that I could avoid re- 
capture,” Wilson said with a care- 
ful choice of words. "But I was 
living in these places in this way so 



that I could learn why the people 
hate scientists.” 

Kelley turned toward the jury 
and the audience until his back was 
almost to Wilson. "I am glad that 
you admit this basic truth, Wilson. 
The people hate scientists, and they 
have good reason to hate. But why 
do you think they hate you.” 

"Not me personally,” Wilson 
said. "All scientists. Blame for that 
lies on both sides. The scientists 
are at fault because they have been 
blind to the needs of the people for 
security, and the people, because 
they have been unable to see that 
the only security is death — or a 
way of life so like death that it is 
scarcely distinguishable.” 

"You are condemning the people 
to death?” 

"You twist my words. The people 
must accept the fact of insecurity. 
I do not say it; life insists on it 
The people must find their security 
in their own ability to cope with 
change. The scientist, on the other 
hand, must give up his childlike 
worship of science. 

"One of the great philosophers 
of science, T. H. Huxley, summed 
it up this way, ‘Science seems to 
me to teach in the highest and 
strongest manner the great truth 
which is embodied in the Christian 
conception of entire surrender to 
the will of God. Sit down before 
fact as a little child, be prepared 
to give up every pre-conceived

AUTOGRAPHS : 

An Interview 
with 

Harr / Harrison 

Hphe story of my interest in sci- 
■** ence fiction is the story of 
my life; at the age of seven I 
came across one of the old large- 
size magazines, with the Frank R. 
Paul covers, and I read it and that 
was that. I’ve been hoping for 
years to come across that issue 
again, but I’m afraid if I ever saw 
it it would be like The Green Man 
of Graypec, which I was so much 
in love with that I cut it out and 
bound it up separately . and 
came across a long time later. When 
I tried to read it, I could only get 
through a couple of pages. Aargh. 
Only Sam Moskowitz can read that 
old stuff and really enjoy it. 

IVe been a fan all my life, start- 
ing around 1932. A few years later 
the Queens Science Fiction League 
came along, and I met such great 
names as Moskowitz and Sykora; 
I stayed on as a member until the 
war came along and I went into the 
Army. 

Wlien I got out I went to art 
school, where I ran into some comics 
artists. I spent a lot of time telling 
them what a negative, degenerate, 




lousy art form comics were; then I 
found myself beginning to do some. 
Actually, they had some damn good 
artists. Beautiful artists, who could 
get just the line they wanted down 
on paper; but the writers were al- 
ways afraid to sign their names. 

I kept working in comics, draw- 
ing and editing, and when the Hy- 
dra Club came along I joined. I 
was Harry The Artist, doing illus- 
trations for Marvel Tales and Gal- 
axy — the first one I remember 
for Galaxy was for Bridge Crossing, 
by Dave Dryfoos; the Art Editor 
was W. I. Vanderpoel at the time 
— and book jackets for Marty 



99 




Greenberg’s Gnome Press and so 

on. 

Then Damon Knight was edit- 
ing a magazine called Worlds Be- 
yond, around 1953; I’d done a 
couple of illustrations for the first 
issue, about half of the second 
issue, the third issue was all mine 
— and then I got a throat in- 
fection. I lost thirty or thirty-five 
pounds, and I was too weak to 
draw, but I could sit up in bed and 
type. So I wrote a story. It was 
called Rocky Diver; Damon bought 
it, and I was immediately antholo- 
gized — the man who did the an- 
thology was also my agent — and 
I should have stopped then, with 
a perfect record: 100% sales, 

100% anthologizations. 

I was still editing comics, and 
writing and drawing them, but sci- 
ence fiction was the Holy Grail. I 
did a little of it — and a lot of 
other kinds of writing. I was a hack 
artist and a hackwriter: Confes- 
sion St Westerns, Detectives — what- 
ever they want to pay money for 
I did. They’d pay me ten dollars 
for a picture, and then I’d write 
a special story around it — maybe 
a confession about a girl in an iron 
lung, dying, giving birth to a baby, 
whatever. 

Then comics collapsed. I’d got- 
ten in with a publisher named John 
Raymond and worked for him on 
his science-fiction and fantasy 
magazines while they lasted; then 
I spent about six months as an art 



editor and got together enough 
money to go to Mexico. I got an 
apartment and an old car and lived 
down there on $75 a month and 
wrote a novel called The Stainless 
Steel Rat, which was my first big 
sale, and never looked back. I 
found that down there I could write 
more than 2,000-word stories, which 
I couldn’t do in New York. 

On the strength of that my wife 
and I went to Europe, for the Lon- 
don Worldcon in 1957, and for the 
next ten years or so we stayed 
there most of the time. My big 
bread-and-butter income was from 
writing Flash Gordon scripts over 
most of that period, but I also did 
a lot of science fiction. We lived in 
England, Italy, back to New York 
for our first baby to be bom, then 
to Denmark, where we stayed for 
seven years. I served as a foreign 
correspondent for a magazine for a 
while, wrote some science articles 
under a pen name — and kept on 
with science fiction. 

I haven’t done any drawing for 
at least ten years — which is a 
good thing; face it, I was a bad 
artist — except that when I was 
sitting on the beach in Italy with 
a ballpoint pen, I did some draw- 
ings of future weapons for a fan- 
zine. We were killing time in a 
little town south of Salerno, wait- 
ing for a free ride back to the states 
from a friend of mine who’s a ship- 
owner; I’d just sold a novel for 
a couple thousand dollars and did 

IB!

not see any point in working, so I 
sat in an olive grove and killed 
time for a couple of weeks. 

While I was in Denmark, I’d 
take a trip to the various science- 
fiction conventions in Europe; I 
met Brian Aldiss at the Trieste 
Film Festival and we kept in touch, 
corresponded, saw each other now 
and then, and we started SF Hor- 
izon, a critical science-fiction mag- 
azine. To my thinking Aldiss is one 
of the big sf writers of the last five 
or ten years. Maybe the biggest. 
His novels have a feeling for con- 
tinuity and form — Non-Stop, 
Greybeard, which I think is a clas- 
sic; it’s going to be the sleeper of 
all time, I swear. 

Then there’s Bester — of course: 
stories like The Stars , My Destina- 
tion — and always there’s Hein- 
lein. Perpetually there’s Heinlein. 
This is the seminal guy in the 
while field. I’m not talking about 
what I consider his bad period — 
he went preachy; the same thing 
happened to Huxley, when he quit 
writing novels in favor of essays 
on society — but the bulk of his 
work satisifies me completely. 

I associate them with the Gold- 
en Age of Astounding, back in the 
’30’s and ’40’s. Those were the per- 
fect days for me; I remember I 
used to go down to Hudson Ter- 
minal to a stand that got the new 
issues two days ahead of anybody 
else — an extra half hour on the 
subway, just to get those two extra 



days. It wasn’t just those two 
writers; there was a whole gestalt 
to that time. Heinlein, Clement, 
Sturgeon, a lot of others; they may 
not all have been polished writers, 
but they were superb entertainers. 

I miss that in a lot of newer writ- 
ers. Ballard, for instance — some of 
his short stories are fine, but his 
novels lose me. Ellison has done a 
couple of good ones — not science 
fiction, though, the ones I like best. 

Fritz Leiber is a guy who’s been 
growing all the time. He writes so 
well . And it’s science fiction to the 
core, sometimes like Lovecraft, with 
a little bit of fantasy. 

Now I’m back in the States — 
we had to make up our minds 
whether we wanted the kids speak- 
ing Danish or English and decid- 
ed on English — and spending just 
about all my time on science fic- 
tion: writing, editing anthologies 
and so on. I have twelve or thir- 
teen books behind me now, enough 
so that I can feel I can survive in 
any environment. The environment 
I’ve got is just below San Diego, 
about four miles from the Mexican 
border; completely away from ev- 
erybody else. We’ve got an acre in 
the hills — rabbits, quail; there’s 
nothing around us, and we’ve got 
the house sealed off with an air- 
conditioner, so we can lock the 
doors and turn off the telephone 
and we’ve got absolute privacy. So 
I can work; and it’s been working 
out very nicely. END

The Fire Egg 

by ROGER F. BURLINGAME 



To a peasant it is not given 
to handle the Holy Things — 
unless he is willing to die I 



44 T Tail” Sum Lin dropped his 
** ^ hoe and knelt in wonder be- 
side the furrow he had just made. 
The tip of the stone hoe had un- 
covered a scaly metal oval, scarce- 
ly distinguishable from the rust-red 
dirt around it. A fire-egg, he told 
himself excitedly! A fire-egg wait- 
ing to hatch in my field! 

Lin picked up the fabulous egg and 
cupped it reverently in his rough 
hands. He felt a sullen warmth 
creep from the metal into his flesh. 
It wants to be bom, he thought. 
It wants me to help it hatch into 
a sickle-bird. I must tell the priest! 

Turning his face toward the rosy, 
cloud-free sky, the boy in black 
pajamas silently thanked the gods 
of the thunder-that-comes-no-more 



for honoring him with this discov- 
ery. Nor did he forget to thank 
them for the many pieces of flat 
hammered steel he would get for 
returning to their local priest this 
symbol of the god’s prehistoric 
activity. 

Panting, Lin arrived at the gate 
of his village. A guard stepped for- 
ward, shifting his rusty M 16 to the 
crook of his elbow to begin the 
customary clothing search, but the 
young farmer protested. “No, 
honored green-head! It is not fit- 
ting to search one who carries a 
holy thing. See, I bring a fire-egg 
to our priest.” 

Proudly he held up the egg. The 
guard automatically reached for it, 
then jerked his hand back to hide

his face. Dropping his non-fuction- 
al rifle, his hands covered his eyes 
under the green-dyed hair. He 
bowed deeply. “Take it, fortunate 
Lin. And tell the Intelligence Win 
Dom that I sped thee on thy mis- 
sion!” 

Achieving some compromise be- 
tween an anxious trot and a self- 
conscious saunter, Lin made his way 
down the dusty main street to- 
ward the priest’s house. This stood 
in the center of the village, a sin- 
gle-storied bungalow of neatly fit- 
ted concrete blocks, contrasting 
with the peeling plaster and wood 
of the village huts. Behind it 
loomed the walls of the sacred en- 
closure where the Superior Persons 
dwelt, who, legend related, once 
could talk to the great sickle-birds 
in their own language. 

Lin knocked respectfully at the 
heavy teak door. Then, stepping 
back, he squatted in the posture 
suitable to his class and waited with 
the patience he used in waiting for 
the annual monsoon. Finally the 
door swung back to reveal the pal- 
lid figure of the priest. 

“Intelligence” Win Dom always 
reminded Lin of a ghost — that is, 
if you believed that ghosts had red 
and baleful eyes. All the rest of the 
man was white: hair, skin and robes. 
Lin was not shocked, for this was 
how all priests looked: white with 
glaring red eyes. Perhaps, thought 
the farmer, that is why they are 
priests. The gods have marked 



AN IF FIRST 

Each month If publishes a story by a 
new writer, never before in print. This 
months "first" is by a 38-year-old minis- 
ter of the Church of Christ in New York 
State. A former Fulbright scholar (to 
Heidelberg, Germany), graduate of Ober- 
lin and the Harvard Divinity School, Rev. 
Burlingame has been a science-fiction 
reader since his teens. The Fire Egg, which 
began as an assignment for a course 
in the Famous Writers School, is his first 
fiction appearance anywhere. 



them for their own by making them 
unlike all living men. 

The old priest’s voice contrasted 
with the brightness of his eyes as 
he said in a dull, unconcerned 
tone, “Thou hast a wish, my son?” 
As soon as he heard the door 
open, Lin shifted from his haunches 
to his knees. Holding up the fire- 
egg in laced fingers, he answered, 
“Truly, Intelligence. I discovered 
this holy egg buried in my new 
field. After giving thanks to the 
gods at once, as is proper, I hur- 
ried to bring it to you!” 

' Getting to his feet, the young 
man made as if to hand the egg to 
the priest. But Win Dom jumped 
back clasping his hands behind him. 
“No, my son. I may not touch it.” 
He hesitated as if in confusion at 
the sudden revelation of holiness. 
“I am not yet purified today. But 
since thou hast found it, keep it 
for now. I must consult with one 
of the superior persons.” 

Lin swallowed his surprise. He 
had never been in contact with 



THE FIRE EGG 



103 





these awesome creatures. Indeed, 
no villager had ever seen one in 
Lin’s generation. They gave their 
orders and directives through the 
priests. Lin placed the egg tender- 
ly inside his shirt* and pressed it 
to his flat stomach while the priest 
disappeared inside the house. 

Tn his office, Win Dom, who 
was called “U-stase” within 
the bosom of his albino family, 
closed the door firmly and stood 
in worried thought. He knew what 
the farm boy had found and he 
knew he had to report it at once. 
Slowly he clenched and unclenched 
his bony fingers as he thought of 
the possibilities of the boy’s dis- 
covery. 

Priestcraft, at least that form in- 
to which Military Intelligence had 
degenerated, informed him of the 
true nature of the fire-eggs, not 
much less powerful than the spit- 
ting teeth of the giant beetles which 
once had fought with and against 
the sickle-birds. 

If Win Dom had such an egg to 
possess, then how superior would 
those insufferable people be inside 
their walled enclosure? With the 
destructive force of the egg at his 
command, he would no longer be 
forced to live in this half-world be- 
tween the great concrete wall and 
the village huts, dependent on the 
good will of his superiors and the 
sometimes intermittent offerings of 
the peasants. 



His thoughts focused on the pic- 
ture of his second son — a hand- 
some infant as white as his father, 
though born without legs. Win 
Dorn’s wife had hidden the child 
with a peasant family; but on the 
boy’s first birthday four green- 
head guards ferreted him out and 
delivered him to the superiors to 
be devoted to the gods. Win Dom 
had never seen this ceremony, but 
he had watched the oily smoke ris- 
ing above the walls of the enclosure. 
He gritted his teeth in an agony 
of remembering. 

Some day! But Win Dom was 
born to be a priest in an age when 
priests were intermediaries, not be- 
tween men and the gods, but be- 
tween two classes of men — the 
, villagers and the superior persons 
who hid behind walls of concrete. 
It’s uncomfortable for a priest to 
live too dose to the gods he serves, 
but it’s unbearable to be bom a 
priest with no more choosing of it 
than the melanin-free skin tint 
which characterized all the mem- 
bers of that profession. 

Win Dom pushed his finger tips 
hard against the plywood top of 
his desk, then let his hands relax. 
His second right index finger moved 
to the button of the patched-up 
intercom and pressed. The box 
responded laconically: “Report!” 
“A farmer, sir, with a fire-egg 
he says he found in his field.” 
The box gave him a black one- 
eyed stare. “Better come in!” 



104 



IF 




XXT'in Dorn’s office had three 

* ^ doors: one opening onto 

the village square, one leading to 
his family quarters, and the third 
a combination wood and steel gate 
opening into the enclosure. The 
priest waited until the gate swung 
back and thought happily how 
those strong hinges could be 
twisted apart by the impact of a 
single, recently found fire-egg. And 
the villagers rushing in for the food 
and metal, and the priests for the 
precious instruments and weapons! 

Entering the check room of the 
enclosure, Win Dom saw the dark 
figure of Bu Run bulging over the 
plastic top of his desk. Bu Run 
smiled at the waspish little priest 
and asked, “What’s with the fire- 
egg, Stase?” 

Win Dom flinched, as always, at 
the inelegant language used by his 
superiors. Even the farm boy spoke 
more correctly, using the proper 
forms of address. With offended 
dignity he reported, “A young farm- 
er, sir, just brought this fire-egg 
to my office. He says he uncovered 
it with his hoe, but my opinion is 
he stole it. There are several holy 
egg shells in our temple museum. 
I will send someone to see if one be 
missing. I have reported the inci- 
dent to you immediately, as the 
directive requires.” 

Bu Run’s dusky smile dissolved 
as he studied the priest. “Do you 
have the egg with you?” 

“No, sir. I left it with the boy, 



thinking it better for the evidence 
to be in his possession if my sus- 
picions were justified.” 

“You don’t think he’ll run a- 
way?” 

Win Dom expressed judicious as- 
surance. “Out of the question, sir. 
He’s after the sheet metal, and he 
won’t do anything to jeopardize his 
reward!” 

Bu Run nodded agreement. “And 
who were you going to send to check 
the museum?” 

Without hesitation Win Dom 
answered, “My oldest son. He is 
worthy of my confidence. We can 
rely on his discretion.” 

Bu Run shook his head impati- 
ently. “Better bring the kid who 
found it in. Let him talk for him- 
self,” he ordered. 

The priest tried to protest, sum- 
moning up regulations prohibiting 
the entrance of village personnel 
into the enclosure. Against his will 
he found himself stepping back 
through the gate into his humid 
office, opening the door to the 
street. Lin was crouched against 
the wall, his arms cradled against 
his stomach warming the precious 
egg, even as it was warming him. 
He rose eagerly as the priest open- 
ed the door. 

“Come, my son, and take cour- 
age. A superior person has ordered 
that thou shouldst bring him the 
holy egg. Surely the reward will be 
great, if thou art thus honored 1” 

Too shocked for speech, Lin fol- 



THE FIRE EGG 



105 




lowed the priest into his office, 
averting his eyes superstitiously 
from the finger play with the inter- 
com. 

As he entered the holy ground 
of the enclosure, Lin’s heart 
laughed inside him. The great one 
must be as excited as he was at 
the discovery. Ah, the sheets of 
gleaming metal that would be his, 
the strong tools, the look of respect 
in the eyes of the village elders 1 
They would visit his house to pay 
him compliments and to ask his 
opinion on the prospects of the 
crops. Even Mai Ling’s father, he 
exulted. 

Ever since he had begun to ap- 
preciate his male equipment, he 
had chosen Mai Ling to be his 
mate. Now her father would re- 
joice to have such a fortunate son- 
in-law. Not for him a girl chosen 
by the old men who make marri- 
ages. He was a man now, with 
the power to choose his own. But 
he stood with humbly bowed neck 
before the glistening table of the 
great one. 

The huge dark person smiled 
gently at him. “You found a fire- 
egg, son?” 

Lin nodded, feeling its soothing 
power against his bare flesh. 

“But the holy one says that you 
stole it,” Bu Run continued. “Now, 
how am I going to find out who 
speaks truth?” 

Aware that the native was un- 



able or afraid to answer, the 
Negro turned to the priest standing 
some distance away. “The dir- 
ective says: where there is no evi- 
dence, the word of the superior is 
to be taken. I think I remember 
it right?” 

Win Dom nodded, a glint in his 
ruby-colored eyes. “You are per- 
fectly correct, sir ! ” 

“Okay, it’s your egg,” Bu Run 
shrugged. “Go ahead and take it.” 
The priest almost jumped for- 
ward, then stopped himself — a re- 
action three ancestors too late. 
“First — first I must get a suitable 
nest for it, sir. The sacred egg must 
lie on soft metal.” 

A smile touched Bu Run’s mouth. 
“What’s the difference? You can 
rely on our discretion. Just get it 
back to the museum!” When Win 
Dom still hesitated, Bu Run’s tone 
grew harsher. “All right. There’s 
one sure way to find out! Have 
your discreet Number One Son 
take this kid out to the hill of 
sacrifice and offer the egg to the 
gods. If it’s a museum egg, they 
won’t take it. If it’s a live fire-egg, 
they’ll let us know!” 

Grudgingly, Win Dom ordered 
the oriental out of the check room 
and started to follow him. “Hold 
it!” Bu Run commanded. “Tell 
him how the little ring hatches the 
egg. Then get back here and leave 
the gate open!” 

The black man leafed through 
the reports lying on his desk. The 



106 



IF 




pages repeated yesterday’s infor- 
mation — or last year’s, for that 
matter. No activity on the peri- 
meter, compound enclosure still at 
safe level. No contact with Saigon 
or off-shore stations. No contact 
with anyone except within the 
sterile incubator of the enclosure. 

The priest returned, and Bu Run 
motioned him to a seat while he 
took out and lit a cigarette, made 
with what he had been assured was 
tobacco. Blowing the first puff of 
smoke toward the open gateway, 
he addressed the albino without 
looking at him. “You never learn, 
do you? We’ve got all the clean 
stuff in here. That’s why you live 
out there, remember? Maybe the 
ground’s clean now, and maybe the 
food’s fit to eat. But the metal they 
dig up is still plenty hot, or ‘holy/ 
as you call it!” 

Win Dom clasped his twelve pale 
fingers together and stared glumly 
at an imaginary speck of mildew 
on the spotless metal desk. 

Bu Run ignored the sullen white 
man and imagined the feel of the 
end-of-duty shower that would clean 
his skin of contamination with 
priest and peasant. 

V\7hen the blast of the concus- 
* ^ sion reached them, the papers 
on Bu Run’s desk fluttered madly. 
Over the hill of sacrifice bits and 
pieces of Sum Lin were undergoing 
separate and bodily assumption in- 
to the cloudless atmosphere of Viet 

THE FIRE EGG ; . 



Nam. 

Sergeant Bu Run, or “Brown,” 
in the archaic pronunciation still 
used in the enclosure, ground out 
his cigarette and signalled for the 
priests to leave. 

Slowly he heaved himself up 
from behind the desk and walked 
to the open gate. It’s the best way 
to get rid of that damned radio- 
active junk, he told himself. Any- 
way, it’s a lot quicker for the poor 
gook than having his stomach cor- 
rode from the inside out. He 
pushed the switch beside the heavy 
gate and watched it swing closed. 
“Well,” he muttered the tradition- 
al benediction. “Keep the faith,

SIX GATES 

by j. t. McIntosh 



There were six ways to get out 
of Limbo . Five of them involved 
suffering — the sixth meant death ! 



108 




TO LIMBO 

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

Tie did not know his name, but with green fields , flowers, a 
the coffin from which he had house to live in, a crystal lake, 
arisen bore the legends Rex. He birds and animals that were love - 
did not know the name of the place ly and unafraid. Two things mar- 
where he found himself and called red it: 

it Limbo. First, an Eden should have an 

It was a paradise — almost — Eve — but Rex had two : the girl 



109 




whose nameplate said Regina, and 
another , the loveliest creature he 
had ever seen, labeled Venus . 

Second, this paradise was sur- 
rounded by a wall . The wall was 
not stone or brick, but a gray, 
queerly fuzzy form of energy . He 
could not pass through it, but 
there were six Gateways in the wall, 
each opening onto another world . 

Rex dared one gateway and 
found himself on the planet of 
Bullan, where the human colonists 
were despairing to the point of 
apathy and even suicide . 

He returned to Limbo, perplexed 
and worried . Yet there was nothing 
to do but to explore the other Gate- 
ways, one by one . He chose the 
second and entered it, this time 
accompanied by Regina . 

They found themselves on a des- 
ert world, where the heat was in- 
tolerable and the only life in sight 
that which had been imported, cell 
by cell, from other planets . It had 
a human population, even great 
cities . Yet it was a dying world, cut 
off from Earth, lacking the basic 
organic components in its ecology 
to keep itself going . and intense- 
ly hostile and suspicious . 

Unfortunately for Rex, he arous- 
ed the suspicions of the first people 
he talked to. He let slip that he 
was not a native, and not from 
Earth — and the girl he was talk- 
ing to reacted instantly. 

She reached to press a button to 
summon help. 



TTe was over the counter in a 
* * moment, her wrist held in his. 
His other hand was over her mouth 
and she was trying to bite it, to 
scream. 

He dragged her through the door- 
way behind her and into the first 
room off the passage there. His luck 
was in; it was a toilet, with a bath, 
showers, and no windows. 

And there she suddenly stopped 
struggling. “You’re a Twentyman,” 
she said. 

He didn’t let her go, but his 
tactics changed. 

“So?” he said. 

“Why hold me, then?” 

He let her go. Twentymen didn’t 
have to use violence. 

“What is a Twentyman?” he 
asked. 

She stared. 

“Tell me,” he said, and instead 
of trying to conceal his power, he 
exerted it all on this thin, pale girl, 
willing her to answer. 

“Oh . you have to be special 
in the first place, the dominant 
people merge with you — ” 

“Merge?” 

“Suicides. Instead of just end- 
ing it all, they merge with the 
Dominant to make a Twentyman. 
Nothing much survives of them, 
everybody knows that. No knowl- 
edge, only traces of skill and in- 
telligence and talent. But some of 
the soul, we believe. The cream. 
The top of the personality. The 



no 



IF 




suicides get peace, and they don’t 
quite die.” 

“And the result?” 

“A Twentyman? He’s stable. He 
never commits suicide. It’s never 
been known. He never gets de- 
pressed. He’s . moral. It’s not pos- 
sible for him to be evil.” 

“Or her?” 

“Girl Twentymen? There aren’t 
so many of them. Not because there 
aren’t as many women suicides, but 
because there aren’t as many girl 
Dominants. Well, do I pass? What 
do you really want?” 

“I came only for information.” 
She looked at him warily. “Not 
about me, surely. I’m nobody. I’ve 
done nothing.” 

“About Cresta.” 

“You came in the last ship?” 
“No.” 

She nodded. “You came like the 
birds.” 

Something clicked. “Birds have 
been turning up here unexpectedly, 
is that it? And you want more?” 
“Millions of them. Somehow, a 
few of them manage to live. You 
do know about the birds, don’t you? 
Where they come from?” 

T Te could guess. The area im- 
* mediately beside the Gateways 
in Limbo was swarming with birds. 
Deliberately, carelessly or blindly, 
many of them had blundered into 
the Gateways. Section K had made 
a mistake there. “There won’t be 
any more,” he said. 



Tears welled from her eyes. She 
didn’t sob. The tears, unchecked, 
ran down her thin face. 

“Then it was Just a mistake,” she 
whispered. “We thought — some 
of us thought — someone was real- 
ly trying to help us.” 

She didn’t resist as he tied her 
to a chair with strips tom from a 
roller towel. Instead, she looked at 
him steadily and said: “Twenty- 
man, unless all I’ve ever heard is 
wrong, you have to be good, moral, 
just. Cresta is hovering between life 
and death. Not the voluntary death 
that faces almost every other world 
in the galaxy. Slow, painful death 
because though we’re a good set- 
tlement we can’t import or create 
enough life to keep us alive. 
Twentyman, wherever you’re from, 
you’ve got to help us.” 

“I can’t promise anything,” he 
said. “But if it turns out it’s pos- 
sible for me to do something, I’ll 
do it.” 

Five minutes later he joined 
Regina and said: “Let’s get out of 
here.” 

The rest had done her no good. 
She was lackluster, drooping. She 
stood up with an effort. 

Nobody paid any more attention 
to them than before. At the edge of 
the city they did not have to wait 
long until there was nobody in 
sight. In the desert they felt safer. 

“What happened?” asked Regi- 
na. 

“I’ll tell you later. I know you’re

in a bad way, Regina, but we have 
to leave this place.” 

“If I survive, I’m never going 
through a Gateway again. You 
know that, don’t you?” 

“Sometimes it’s worse than 
others.” 

Her tired brain gave up the 
effort. It was all she could do to 
plod along, reeling. 

All the way back to the Gateway, 
Rex was looking for corpses of 
birds. To his relief he saw none. 
So the birds, although they had 
given the Crestans a clue to the 
existence of the Gateway, had given 
them no clue to its exact location. 

Without Regina’s unerring sense 
of direction, they’d never have 
found the Gateway. The coinci- 
dence which showed them exactly 
where it was would have been of 
no value to them if they hadn’t 
been within fifty yards of it at the 
time and making directly for it. 

A large pigeon suddenly appear- 
ed from nowhere, flapping desper- 
ately. It fell to the ground as if it 
had been brought down by a shot. 
But within a couple of seconds, its 
movements more coordinated, it 
took off and began making wide 
circles in the sky. 

“Nothing to them, apparently,” 
said Regina. 

The tiny effort of thinking and 
speaking proved too much for her. 
Her knees buckled and she folded. 

Rex had to carry her to the Gate- 
way. 

112

n ex managed, with enormous ef- 
fort, to get down the stairway. It 
took him half an hour. Surprising- 
ly, Regina was conscious, though 
too weak to raise an arm. He had 
to leave her on the platform, 
knowing that if he tried to help 
her down they would both tumble 
all the way. 

This time there was no water. 
But within yards of the base of the 
stairway were hundreds of eggs. 
Rex sucked a few and took some to 
Regina. Half an hour later, with 
his help, she was able to get down 
the stairs. 

And then Venus was with them, 
strong and capable. Rex noted in- 
differently, for consideration later, 
that Venus had known they were 
back the moment they arrived, as 
Regina would have done. 

It was late afternoon when they 
reached Limbo, and it was begin- 
ning to get dark as they dragged 
themselves into the house, Venus 
half carrying Rex and more than 
half carrying Regina. Only then did 
Rex ask Venus: “How long were 
we gone?” 

“Twenty-nine days,” she said. 

As Venus carried Regina up- 
stairs and put her to bed, Rex, 
sprawled in an armchair, realized 
that Venus had a clear and impor- 
tant role in Limbo after all — the 
unlikely one of nurse. 

Later, when she had heard the 



IF 




story, it was Venus who hit on the 
one word that crystallized the mood 
of Strand 7, probably of the whole 
world. 

“Desperation,” she said. 

That was it. As Bullan was 
characterized by apathy, Cresta 
was a world of desperation. The 
scheme to re-create life on the 
planet wasn’t going to work unless 
someone or something much bigger 
and richer and more powerful than 
the little Crestan settlement weigh- 
ed in and made it work. 

It was a far better world than 
Bullan, but perhaps only because 
Cresta couldn’t afford apathy. 
Cresta had to be desperate . 

N ext day all Regina could do 
was lie on a divan out in the 
open and drink orange juice. 

She had always been tiny and 
fragile. Now as she lay soaking up 
the veiled sunlight of Limbo, she 
was a ghost of the tiny creature 
she had been. 

“Obviously,” she said faintly 
when she caught Rex looking at 
her, “I can’t go through a Gateway 
again. I hope you never go. I know 
I can’t.” 

Rex sat down beside her. “Per- 
haps you can,” he said. 

“Rex, I can’t take that again. 
Oh, I’d do it if it was the only way 
of getting back here. If it was a 
matter of life and death. But when 
it’s only an experiment, something 
done out of curiosity, because you 



believe exploration is important 
» 

“What I meant was I don’t 
think transference need be so bad 
as that. The galaxy model doesn’t 
tell us where Limbo is, but if we 
assume the length of time gone is 
proportional to the distance trav- 
eled— we Ve got to assume some- 
thing — we’ll soon get some indi- 
cation where Limbo probably is. 
When I went to Bullan I was gone 
seventeen days.The Cresta double 
trip took twenty-nine. Bullan is 
roughly two-thirds of the way to 
the rim of the galaxy, from the cen- 
ter. Cresta is practically on the 
rim. Suppose Limbo is roughly at 
the center — ” 

“Thai we’ll have a long trip to 
Earth,” said Regina tiredly. 

“We can’t go to Earth. On my 
theory, the next world, Neri, is far- 
ther than Bullan, farther even than 
Cresta. Landfall not quite as far as 
Bullan. Chuter, at the center of the 
galaxy, may be no distance at all. 
We may even be on Chuter.” 

“Rather wild guesses, aren’t 
they?” 

“Of course. To check it, I sug- 
gest we go to Chuter next. All of 
us, Venus too. If I’m right, the 
journey won’t be anything like the 
ordeal the long trips are — ” 

“Let’s discuss further expeditions 
from Limbo,” said Regina, “in 
about three months, when I feel 
approximately human again.” 

Inevitably, with Regina spending 



SIX GATES TO LIMBO 



113 




all day and every day lying in the 
sun, Venus and Rex spent a lot of 
time together, working together. It 
was Venus who helped Rex to fix 
up a light framework of steel and 
wood round three sides of the plat- 
form facing the Cresta Gateway, 
preventing birds from flying into 
it and at the same time leaving the 
Gateway open. Later she helped 
Rex to build another stairway at 
the Chuter Gateway. 

Three weeks after the return of 
Rex and Regina from Cresta, the 
three of them stood rather awk- 
wardly at the foot of the Chuter 
stairway. Rex’s relations with Reg- 
ina had been strained in the last 
few days. They had not quarreled, 
largely because the Gateways were 
never mentioned. But it was an 
awkward situation, a man going on 
a possibly dangerous mission with 
a beautiful woman, leaving his wife 
behind because she had flatly re- 
fused to go. 

“Good-by, Regina.” Rex was for- 
mal partly because Venus was there 
and partly because he wanted the 
parting, since it could not be cor- 
dial, to be as neutral as possible. 
He kissed Regina lightly, started 
to say something, and stopped. 

They waved from the top of the 
stairway . 

T his time there was scarcely any 
unconsciousness. It was almost 
like awakening from a healthy 
night’s sleep, with a certain thirst, 



a desire to go to the bathroom and 
clean his teeth, but no more than 
that. 

Rex took a drink from his water- 
bottle. They were in a forest of 
huge trees, with a blinding sun 
shooting white arrows through 
thick foliage. 

Venus smiled at him. She was 
throwing aside everything but the 
sandals, skirt and blouse which she 
had worn under her overalls for 
use as tropical kit, as Regina had 
done on Cresta. 

“Now let’s get this clear, Venus,” 
he said warmly. “Until we know 
better, our overalls are our best 
chance of passing unnoticed on this 
or any other world. Now put them 
back on.” 

She shook her head slowly, her 
smile fading. “No,” she said. “It 
doesn’t matter a damn how we look 
here — because there’s no one to 
see.” 

They marked the location of the 
Gateway. Then they drank, ate 
some chocolate and found the edge 
of the forest. 

When they saw the city Venus 
said soberly: “It’s dead.” 

“You can sense things, like 
Regina?” 

“Not quite like Regina. She can 
see places, things. I can only sense 
the living and the dead.” 

“And this planet is dead?” 

“No, the animals, birds and in- 
sects are alive. Look, there’s a flight 
of birds. But humans . it’s hard to 



114 



IF 




say. Quite recently, I think, there 
were humans. Now they’re either 
dead or have gone away.” 

The moment they stepped from 
the shade the heat hit them, making 
them gasp for breath. Instantly Rex 
was wet with sweat. 

Two out of three worlds very 
hot. This was worse than Cresta. 

They walked over yellow grass 
to the city. It was neat and clean 
and new, but nobody moved in it. 
The streets were bare. On the 
whole, it looked as if there had been 
orderly evacuation rather than dis- 
aster. Certainly there had been no 
sudden disaster, for doors were 
locked, cars were off the streets, 
and there was no damage. Dust and 
dirt were negligible. 

“There’s no life,” said Venus, 
but I can tell the places where life 
has most recently been.” 

They went to some of these 
places and found bodies. 

It was no puzzle, no secret. This 
city, which was called, rather for- 
biddingly, Havoc, had killed itself, 
gradually, systematically, in- 
glorioudy. 

Plenty of material was left for 
anyone who wanted to write a his- 
tory. of the Last Days of Havoc. 
Some of the last messages were mere 
suicide notes. Some were volumin- 
ous diaries. Many were tapes left 
on recorders. 

Rex and Venus read and listened 
to many of these messages from 
the grave. 



The last man in Havoc died 
three months before they arrived 
on February 4, 3652. They found 
several chronometers still recording 
both galactic time and local time. 

In all those hundreds of thous- 
ands of last words, they did not 
find exactly why Havoc had com- 
mitted suicide. 

Some blamed the incessant heat. 
Some blamed the solitude — Havoc 
was the only city on the planet, a 
pilot city set up and populated with 
5,000 people and left for five years. 

One blamed the fact that there 
had never been a child in Havoc. 
On tape he said: “We were meant 
to have children. There were plenty 
of young couples. But who was to 
be the first to bring a child into 
this world? Early on, we lost heart. 
It was too hot; the work was hard; 
there was no variety; nobody could 
be bothered to do any more than 
stay alive ...” 

There was a long pause, and then 
the tired voice went on, the tired 
voice of a man of twenty-nine 
whose twenty-three-year-old wife 
had killed herself that morning. 

“We drew together, once there 
were gaps. We hadn’t been here a 
year, and the ship from Earth 
wouldn’t arrive for five years — 
that was the bargain. Most of us 
hadn’t realized how hard the cleav- 
age from Earth would hit us. And 
only a few could go back, we knew 
that — just a few to tell the story 
That was the bargain...” 



116 



IF 




A woman who did not give her 
*** name but who sounded like 
a young girl said on her tape: 
“There is a sickness in mankind. 
Doomsday is near . and it’s our 
own doing. A hundred suicides, five 
other deaths. Only 4,895 of us left. 
The heat. The tiny city. The work. 
The four years still to wait. And 
no way of getting back to Earth 
then . Why did we ever agree?” 

There was escalation in suicide. 
When there were still over 3,000 
of them, the people of Havoc began 
to be terrified of being left alone. 

The last man had died just eight 
months short of the scheduled re- 
turn of the ship from Earth. Eight 
months was just too long to wait. 

There was one thing more, the 
thing that made it hopeless, point- 
less, to wait for the ship. Havoc 
had murder as well as suicide on its 
hands. 

A low voice on one of the tapes 
said: “We grew to hate the Twenty- 
• men. The rest of us had let go, and 
they wouldn’t let go. They wouldn’t 
let us give up. 

“So we killed them. Yes, we 
killed the Twentymen. All three of 
them. We couldn’t have done it face 
to face. We arranged a meeting. 
They turned up. We didn’t. And 
the bomb went off.” 

The pause was so long that they 
thought there was no more on the 
tape. Then the voice began again, 
perfectly calm now:' “That did it. 
Yes, we meant to kill them. We 



weren’t sorry they were dead. We 
didn’t repent. They didn’t haunt 
us. But later — how could we wait 
for the ship and say when it came 
we murdered three Twentymen be- 
cause they were Twentymen, be- 
cause they wouldn’t let us give up?” 

Rex looked up at Venus. They 
had been listening in silence. 

“Apathy, desperation and . 
what?” he said. 

“Fear,” she said. “The most 
spineless kind of mass surrender. 
They even murdered through fear.” 

“It’s pathological, of course,” 
Rex mused. “Mass neurosis.” 

“And that girl was right. It’s not 
just in the pathetic five thousand 
who came here. It’s in mankind.” 

“They know it and they do 
nothing about it. Doomsday is 
near ” 

“For Havoc,” said Venus drily, 
“Doomsday has come and gone.” 

XII 

egina met them halfway be- 
tween the Chuter Gateway and 
the house. 

“You were gone only two days,” 
she said. 

Rex turned his head away to 
smile. She was surprised, even a 
little resentful, that the Chuter 
mission had so obviously been easy. 

Regina had taken a stand against 
a course she felt to be highly dan- 
gerous and a big test of endurance. 
She had flatly refused to submit 



SIX GATES TO LIMBO 



117 




herself to such an ordeal again. Had 
Rex and Venus returned exhausted, 
parched, famished, barely able to 
stagger from the Gateway, she 
wouldn’t necessarily have said “I 
told you so,” but only because it 
would not have been necessary to 
say anything. Now it seemed that 
the Chuter trip had been no more 
arduous than an overnight stop in 
the far south of Limbo. 

“What did you find?” she asked 
crossly. 

Rex told her. 

As they rested at the lake, Venus 
said abruptly: “Suppose we go to 
Chuter and stay there.” 

Regina’s astonished stare was her 
only answer. 

“I mean it,” said Venus. “Moving 
between Chuter and Limbo is easy, 
like walking through any ordinary 
doorway. If we want anything, we 
can easily come back. There’s an 
empty city on Chuter, crops for 
five thousand, plenty of fruit.” 

“But why?” Rex asked. 

“Don’t you want to meet the 
people behind Limbo? The people 
of Section K? There will be a ship 
from Earth in five months. It 
wouldn’t have taken five thousand 
people back to Earth — that wasn’t 
in the bargain, as so many dead 
men told us. But it’ll take three, if 
we’re persuasive. If we let them see 
we’re Twentymen — ” 

“Yes,” said Rex thoughtfully. 

“Instead of dragging this on, 
there’s a way to get it over with.” 



“How?” said Regina quickly. 
“We’d have to work together. 
The three of us draw lots for Neri, 
Byron, Landfall. Then we all go 
at the same time, each alone, and 
compare notes when we get back.” 
They thought about it. Rex liked 
the idea: it was a way to get this 
preliminary investigation over, 
this thing which had to be done, 
and be on Chuter in plenty of time 
to be sure of meeting the ship. 

It was Regina, of course, who 
raised doubts. “Will that be 
enough? A quick glance at the three 
other worlds?” 

“It might be,” Rex said. “I don’t 
think the Gateways are meant to 
provide six keys, each of them ne- 
cessary to unlock a vast puzzle. 
They’re more like six windows. We 
look through each of them, and 
having done so, we act.” 

There was still one more impor- 
tant objection Regina could make. 
She made it. “Assuming you’re 
right about the position of Limbo 
— near the center of the galaxy, 
certainly very near Chuter — who- 
ever draws Neri is going to be a 
long time gone. Maybe forever.” 
Rex nodded, frowning. “I know. 
We have to assume it can be done. 
And that it’s important.” He took 
it for granted somehow that- he 
would draw Neri. 

“You want me to draw, Rex?” 
He hesitated. At last he said: “I 
don’t wish danger on you, Regina. 
I don’t want you to be hurt, or go 



118 



IF 




through anything like what hap- 
pened last time. But I do want you 
to work on this.” 

“Fll draw,” she said. 

Rex got Byron, Regina Landfall, 
and Venus Neri. 

egina lay for a time without 
opening her eyes, not wishing 
to awaken. But inexorably aware- 
ness came back, and at last she sat 
up abruptly and opened her eyes, re- 
membering before she saw anything 
that she was not in the climatic 
chaos of Landfall after all. She was 
back in Limbo. 

One disappointment . she was 
alone in Limbo. Venus was not like- 
ly to be back from Neri for several 
weeks, but Rex might easily have 
been back before her, especially 
since she had been forced to spend 
eight days in Landfall. 

She shuddered at some of her 
memories of Landfall, and then 
breathed deep relief at being back 
in Limbo. 

Rex was not back, as she knew 
the moment she reached out with 
the 'fingers of her mind. She was 
not really worried about him, how- 
ever. It was by the greatest good 
luck, as well as courage she did not 
credit herself with possessing, that 
she was back in Limbo. Some of the 
desperate things she had done she 
had accomplished only because 
there was clearly no choice. But 
Rex was different. 

Her black plastic snowsuit was 



still damp inside. Curiously, trans- 
ference, which took days, brought 
hunger and thirst, but wet clothes 
didn’t dry. 

She started off for the house at 
a determined trot. Soon she had to 
remove her plastic suit. She left it 
hidden under a bush in case Rex 
wanted to examine it as a product 
of Landfall, the only one she had 
brought back. 

Exertion made her hungry and 
thirsty, proving that she was in far 
better state despite the rigors of her 
stay in Inverkoron than on her re- 
turn from Cresta, or even on her 
arrival at Cresta. But she did not 
pause again until she was home. 

Home . Luxuriating in a warm, 
scented bath that eased her cuts 
and bruises and drew all the other 
aches from her body, she remem- 
bered that once she had told Rex 
that Earth was home. Well, so it 
was. Yet she was less inclined now 
ever to return there. Landfall had 
helped to cure her. 

She was still in her bath when 
she sensed that Rex was back. She 
laughed aloud in relief. On the 
point of jumping out of the bath 
and running to him, she changed 
her mind and relaxed again. There 
was no sense of distress about his 
arrival. He would make straight for 
the house, as they had agreed. Since 
the Byron Gateway was the nearest 
except for Bullan, he would be back 
in an hour or so. She needed that 
time to make herself look her best,

start a meal in the kitchen, and 
make a quick round of the house 
without which it could not be con- 
sidered habitable.

CC^Tou first, please,” Regina said. 

* They were in the lounge with 
glasses and a bottle of wine Rex had 
brought back from Byron. Regina, 
in a cool white dress, somewhat 
Grecian and nearly ankle-length, 
was curled on the sofa. 

Rex looked at her thoughtfully, 
wonderingly. “You’ve changed, 
Regina,” he said. 

“In no essential particular,” she 
said. “True, IVe been nearly killed 
by men and women and the ele- 
ments, beaten with sticks a couple 
of times, had to swim a river full 
of ice floes, escaped rape only be- 
cause my host turned out to be 
temporarily impotent, dashed 
against trees in a forest by a wind 
the like of which youVe never 
dreamed, had my throat cut — ” 
“What?” 

“Oh, it was a threat rather than 
a serious attempt at murder. And 
as you see a surgeon was called in 
at once and fixed me up so that it 
will never show.” 

She shrugged. “All that is noth- 
ing really, now it’s over and I don’t 
have to go through it again. Maybe 
you’re right that I’ve changed, Rex, 
but that wasn’t what changed me. 
Let’s have your story, Rex.” 



“There’s nothing in it to match 
yours. Oh, all right.” 

It was not an exciting or even a 
very interesting story. Byron was 
superficially very Terran. Nobody 
bothered Rex, except one maniac 
reminiscent of the one he had en- 
countered on Bullan. 

Byron was, literally, a mad world, 
a schizoid world. Except for the 
Twentymen, who were more neces- 
sary there than in most places to 
preserve even a semblance of order, 
the Byronians were manic-depres- 
sives reacting violently on each 
other. Their particular type was 
gay-sad, with frenetic gaiety swit- 
ching itself, sometimes instantly, to 
blackest depression. The suicide 
rate was the highest in the galaxy. 

“Can’t be higher than Chuter,” 
Regina remarked in one of her rare 
interruptions. “There it was 100 per 
cent.” 

Byron was a world of fantastic 
excesses. “Venus would find a word 
to sum it all up,” said Rex, “but 
I can’t. Decadence, maybe. Some- 
times it reminded me of Rome at 
its most rotten, with people carous- 
ing at the most incredible orgies 
and then having each other mur- 
dered the next morning. Incest — 
they make quite a point of that. 
Any man with an attractive daugh- 
ter who has not contrived to go to 
bed with her is considered . let’s 
say peculiar. There are few of these, 
because it’s equally obligatory for 
any girl demonstrably nubile to 



120 



IF 




complete the Electra adventure. 
The Search for Something on By- 
ron, is so desperate, so unremitting, 
that anything that has not been 
tried has to be tried, no matter how 
revolting.” 

He shook his head as if to clear 
it. “I stayed longer than I need have 
done, looking for something that 
wasn’t there. On Byron, it was easy 
to stay. Find any wildly enthusias- 
tic fun-maker, and he’ll give you 
half what he owns. I tried to pump 
some of the Twentymen, but all I 
found was that they feel it their 
duty to keep the unholy mess from 
being even worse. Is that enough, 
or do you want any more details?” 

TO egina sipped her wine. “This 
is good. Very good. Does that 
mean nothing?” 

“Nothing. I got it from some 
Twentymen who made it them- 
selves. They gave me a few things 
because I helped them in a small 
way — a few pitiful things that rep- 
resented the best of Byron. There’s 
a couple of paintings we might hang 
somewhere, a weird dress for you 
that’s either brilliant or insane, a 
book that nobody understands but 
nobody puts down. I left them at 
the Gateway and hurried here.” 

Regina stood up and began to 
move about the room, but not rest- 
lessly, Rex noticed, rather with a 
casual grace which he would have 
said before this night was more 
typical of Venus than Regina. He 



looked at her admiringly and with 
a new wonder. 

It was hard to listen without ir- 
relevant anger or belated protect- 
iveness as she told him what had 
happened to her on Landfall. 

The dominant feature of Land- 
fall was rage. Not the maniacal 
rage he had encountered on Byron. 
Cold rage directed mainly at Earth, 
so far away from Landfall and so 
implacable. 

Unfortunately, the first time 
Regina spoke, her accent immedi- 
ately identified her as Terran. 

There were no Twentymen in 
Landfall. It was partly for this 
reason that all the nastiness of 
humanity went naked there, with- 
out even the minor check on the 
baser instincts that the Twentymen 
achieved. 

When -Regina gave herself away 
as a Terran, a gang of teenagers, 
girls as well as youths, beat her 
with sticks. Rescued by police, she 
was taken to headquarters, where 
they shut her in an open courtyard 
with snow three feet deep and for- 
got her existence. 

Hungry and frozen, she labored 
for an hour to build up stamped- 
down snow so that she could climb 
over a thirteen-foot gate and was 
on the point of escape when one 
of the fantastic climactic reversals of 
Landfall hit the courtyard. A blast 
of searing heat, swirling, boiling, 
dry air, funneled down, took 
Regina’s breath away and melted 



SIX GATES TO UMBO 



121 




the snow in seconds. Although the 
drainage was good — it had to be 
in Inverkoron — she was soaked to 
the waist before the water had 
flowed away. 

Since there was now no means of 
escape over the gate, she had to 
take the chance of breaking a win- 
dow and entering one of the build- 
ings. For the first time fortune 
favored her; she found herself in 
a pantry, and thereafter hunger 
wasn’t a major hardship. 

She escaped from the building 
easily enough, but her gray overalls 
did not make her inconspicuous in 
Inverkoron, where everyone wore 
plastic- suits with hoods, internally 
heated. A crowd gathered again, 
shouting abuse at her, and die was 
saved from further violence only 
by the intervention of a little fat 
man. 

The little fat man took her home 
with him, and she went not unwill- 
ingly because it was snowing heav- 
ily again, night was falling and she 
knew it was physically impossible 
at the moment for her to reach the 
Gateway, allhough it was barely a 
mile from Inverkoron. She felt she 
could handle the little fat man, and 
she couldn’t handle a mob. 

I t worked out quite well, the 
first night. The little man 
lived pitifully in a tiny and rather 
dirty corner of a large house. Once 
the whole house had been his and 
technically it still was, but after his 



wife and family left him he was not 
allowed to keep all that first-class 
accommodation to himself. Despite 
his wealth, he was shoved into a 
bedroom, bathroom and kitchenette, 
and this palatial suite was walled 
off from the rest of the house. He 
entered by a door starkly cut in the 
outside wall of the bedroom. 

“You don’t sound at all sorry for 
the little man,” said Rex. 

“I’m not sorry for him,” said 
Regina grimly. “Wait.” 

The little man started to make 
supper, but gratefully accepted 
Regina’s offer to take over. After- 
wards, he made passes at her which 
she was able to ignore. She slept 
at first on the floor and later in 
the bath, with the door locked, after 
wakening to find her host feebly 
pawing her. 

The next morning she made 
breakfast and decided she had seen 
enough of Landfall. After breakfast 
the little man, who had apparently 
been steeling himself, made quite 
a determined assault on her virtue. 
Regina was not impressed until she 
found herself pressed against a wall 
by his greater weight, with a long 
and very sharp knife at her throat. 

“That was when it happened,” 
Rex said. 

She nodded. “He was so ineffec- 
tual I was sure he was bluffing. I 
made it very clear that in no cir- 
cumstances would I have anything 
to do with him, in that way. Then 
I felt blood running down my neck.” 



122 



IF 




A doctor was called, and she was 
patched up efficiently. The little 
man was incoherently apologetic, 
and she did feel a little sorry for 
him... until the police arrived, 
called by the little fat man, to take 
her away, because she was no good 
to him. 

She then spent several days in a 
semi-jail, semi-asylum. She was fed 
well enough and nobody bothered 
her. There was no word of trial 
either. 

Then three men came to pay her 
fine and, apparently, buy her. As 
a Terran she had no rights. She was 
not supposed to be there. Any time 
she ceased to be there, no one 
would care. 

iiHphe last night,” said Regina 
“I was locked in a bathroom 
right at the top of an eleven-story 
block of flats I — ” 

“Hey, what’s this?” Rex de- 
manded “You’ve skipped about 
four days.” 

Regina said firmly. “Honestly, I 
don’t think it’s relevant. There’s 
more to tell you, but what matters 
all happened after I was locked in 
that bathroom — ” 

“Please, Regina,” said Rex. 

She looked at him steadily, ask- 
ing him not to insist. When he said 
nothing, she sighed and said: “All 
right. They bought me to put me 
on show.” 

“On show?” 

“For people to pay money to 



spit on a Terran girl. At first they 
hung me up outside by my wrists, 
in a disgusting costume, and period- 
ically threw water over me. But I 
fainted from the cold, and they saw 
they were going to lose me very 
quickly if they went on treating 
me like that. So they moved the 
show inside and dressed me in filthy 
rags. Thousands of people came.” 

She shuddered. “The little fat 
man came, and he spat on me. They 
let me loose, but with my hands 
tied behind my back, and threw 
disgusting food on the floor. I was 
supposed to get down and lick it 
with my tongue. I ignored it, and 
they beat me with sticks. I still 
wouldn’t eat the food on the floor. 
After that they fed me decently. I 
was a valuable property.. More 
thousands came. Then the flow be- 
gan to diminish. A new act was 
needed. This time they cleaned me 
up and made me a pin-up girl, 
swathed in jewels and yards of scar- 
let satin. At least the crowds weren’t 
allowed to spit any more. That 
worked for another day.” 

“They had a lot of bright ideas, 
did they?” Rex said quietly. “I 
can guess.” 

“The best one, of course, was to 
put me up for auction — not for 
keeps, just for a half-hour. I told 
you about that already. My spon- 
sors were annoyed, because this part 
of the show was public too, and it 
was an utter flop. More than that, 
I got scratched and they had to let

123 




me clean myself. That was when 
I was locked in the bathroom.” 
“Ah,” said Rex. He was fighting 
down the impulse to go to Inver- 
koron immediately and clobber 
everyone in sight. 

“Well, I knew I was on the top 
floor. I knew the river Koron flowed 
past the block. They knew that too. 
I suppose it didn’t occur to them, 
because I’d made it perfectly clear 
that I wasn’t the suicide type, that 
I’d break the window and jump 
out.” 

Rex got up and sat beside her, 
taking her in his arms. “Why did 
you?” he asked. 

“Well, it was the first real chance 
I’d had. So I took it” 

“Yes,” said Rex, caressing her 
gently. 

“So ... I dropped the satin rub- 
bish on the floor, because it could 
only hamper me. I smashed the win- 
dow with a jar of bath salts. Then 
I got through and pushed myself 
outwards as I fell. The water was 
freezing. Anyway, I missed the ice 
floes. I went so deep I thought I’d 
never come up again. But after I 
reached the other side and climbed 
out, the cold struck right through 
me, I could scarcely move for shiv- 
ering, and I knew I had to get a 
snowsuit in about two minutes or 
it would be too late.” 

“You got it,” said Rex. 

“Yes. I don’t know whether I 
killed the man or just stunned him. 
When I saw his face I was relieved. 



I was certain he was one of those 
who spat on me. That made me feel 
a lot less guilty.” 

The whole thing should have been 
over then. She was less than half a 
mile from the Gateway. However, 
she had scarcely passed the end of 
the last bridge across the Koron 
when she heard the howling mob 
racing across from the other side. 
She must have been heard break- 
ing the window. They must have 
guessed where she had to go. 

S he ran, at least having the ad- 
vantage of knowing exactly 
where she was going. In a flurry 
of snow it seemed for a minute or 
two that she was bound to make 
it. Then the night cleared, the air 
went still and there was a shout be- 
hind her as the mob saw her. 

Looking over her shoulder she 
tripped on a root, and although 
she was up at once, no bones 
broken, she could not put her left 
foot to the ground. And she knew 
it was over — the wrong way. 

She turned to wait for the mob, 
and, twenty beams of light fastened 
on her as she waited without a 
trace of fear, despising the mob too 
much for fear. 

She smiled. 

One of the beams faltered, then 
another. The crowd broke. 

“It was all unnecessary,” Regina 
sighed. “Hadn’t you already found 
that for yourself? Landfall has no 
Twentymen, but when I stood and 



126 



IF 




faced them, they were helpless. I 
needn’t have let those kids beat 
me. I could have handled the little 
fat man more easily with my eyes, 
if I ever really looked at him. The 
three showmen, even the crowds, 
I could have silenced and cowed. I 
didn’t need tn be brave, to be des- 
perate. I’m a Twentyman. If I’d 
stood up for myself and dared them 
to touch me, instead of bowing my 
head and hoping I’d find the cour- 
age to get through the next ten 
minutes, none of this would have 
happened.” 

Rex turned her head and kissed 
her. “Thank you,” he said. 

“For what?” 

“For helping. For going through 
all that.” 

“Unnecessarily.” 

“No. If you’d marched into Inver- 
koron as a Twentyman, making all 
bow down before you, you’d have 
learned nothing.” 

“And it matters, Rex? You think 
it matters? Does what we’ve found 
out make sense?” 

“Yes,” he said. 

“Well, tell me the sense.” 

He shook his head. “It’s one of 
those things that everyone has to 
decide for himself, or herself.” 
“And you’ve decided?” 

“Yes.” 

“Then Venus is wasting her time? 
You already know what she’ll find?” 
“No, I wouldn’t say that. I could 
make a few guesses, not more than 
three. If she confirms what I sus- 



pect, that will be very important.” 

Regina shrugged. “My voice is 
raw. I’m tired. The wine is finished. 
Venus won’t be back for days, may- 
be weeks. I’m disgusted with some 
men, but not, strangely enough, with 
you. Are you coming to bed or 
aren’t you?” 

“I’m coming.” 

Much later they established, al- 
most definitely, that that was the 
start of Regina’s pregnancy. 

XIV 

nphey were both, as it happened, 
A obliviously ill at the moment 
when Venus returned from Neri. 
It was food poisoning, beyond doubt 
the result of using a defective can 
of food. Even in Limbo, such things 
could happen. As a result, Regina 
was too deeply asleep, with a high 
temperature, to sense Venus’s re- 
turn, and Rex couldn’t do things 
like that anyway. 

Thus it was that Rex, venturing 
shakily downstairs late the next day, 
encountered Venus dragging herself 
tiredly into the house, wrapped in 
a shapeless, all-enveloping cloak 
which was curiously stained. Weak 
as he was, he rushed to help her, but 
she held up her hand. 

“I’ll manage,” she said. “I’ll be 
all right now.” 

She was as beautiful as ever, 
though tired. 

“I won’t be down for two or three 
days,” she said, “but I think I can

127 




tell you in one word all that Neri 
stands for.” 

“Venus, I’m sorry we weren’t 
able to help you — ” 

“Never mind that. I didn’t need 
help, and I’m back now, thank God. 
You and Regina are all right, I 
know. In fact you’re closer than 
you ever were.” 

She dragged herself towards the 
stairs, and Rex had to check him- 
self. Except when it was accidental 
or in play, or in tiny acts of cour- 
tesy, she had never let him touch 
her, he remembered. 

“Neri in one word,” she said, 
turning at the foot of the stairs. 
“Cruelty.” 

And as he watched her, with 
troubled eyes, pulling herself up by 
the banister, Rex realized that what 
Regina had suffered in Inverkoron 
was merely rage, as she described 
it, not cruelty. 

t was winter in London. 

There had been no difficulty 
in getting this far. There had been 
regret at leaving Limbo, greater 
regret at leaving Regina. It had 
been decided that he alone should 
return to Chuter and wait for the 
ship there. 

There was regret at leaving Lim- 
bo and Regina to go to Earth, but 
no difficulty. The ship from Earth, 
a fast scout, arrived at Havoc ex- 
actly on schedule, and Rex, for once 
admitting from the first his Twen- 
tyman status, found he could have 



told any lie and been believed. As 
it happened, it was unnecessary to 
tell any lies, except the indirect 
one of pretending to be one of the 
Chuter Twentymen. He had tem- 
porarily adopted the identity of an 
actual Twentyman, one of the first 
to be murdered. 

The crew and field-study group 
brought by the ship were quite un- 
surprised at what had happened. 
They were rather surprised and re- 
lieved to find a surviving Twenty- 
man who could save time and trou- 
ble by telling them what had hap- 
pened and had already collated the 
story of the last days of the Havoc 
settlement. Anyway, he was taken 
back to Earth, where he was to re- 
port, conveniently, to the Depart- 
ment of Education and Science, 
London — not Section K, but an- 
other section in the same building. 

As he strode through archaic 
slush in London’s West End, know- 
ing Regina was only six months 
pregnant and that it was perfectly 
possible that he might be back in 
Limbo before her time came, Rex 
was in a mood to get the present 
unpleasant business over as soon 
as possible. 

London was one of the museum 
cities of Earth, the central part 
kept as it had been a thousand 
years ago, except that only cere- 
monial traffic ever passed through 
the old-fashioned streets. 

Wearing a hat, coat and gloves 
over a lounge suit and leather shoes

IF 




(all charged to Section K), Rex 
looked more at the people than the 
surroundings. 

He was reminded of Bullan. 

Mercury was no museum dty. Un- 
like the West End of London, it was 
entirely functional, planned and 
built for the present circumstances. 
Yet the people who passed him 
without even a glance at him re- 
minded him irresistibly of the 
people of Mercury, although they 
were dressed quite differently. 

Tourists had to be allowed in, 
had to be allowed even to live in the 
sanctuary, because otherwise the 
object would not be achieved. The 
Ritz, the Dorchester, the Grosve- 
nor, the Berkeley were still there, 
but only outworld visitors could 
stay there. The waiting list was so 
enormous that chance decided who 
actually got in; there was a com- 
plicated system of priorities for 
Earth visits, and even someone who 
got to the head of the list had to 
accept the booking he got, which 
might be for London, New York, 
Moscow, Berlin, Paris, Edinburgh, 
Shanghai, Calcutta, Sydney or any 
other of the seven hundred museum 
cities or the five thousand reserva- 
tions. 

Apart from the gawking visitors, 
the people, like the Mercurians, 
were isolated, apathetic. The Ter- 
rans were no master-race. 

Rex reached the Department of 
Education and Science and looked 
at its exterior, unimpressed. He was 



not surprised to find it took up the 
whole of one side of Hill Street. 
He would not have been surprised 
if it stretched all the way to the 
Thames. 

TTe entered by a glass door and 
*■* -■* found himself between two 
lines of reception desks, as if the 
Department of Education and 
Science dealt with hundreds of 
visitors an hour. But he and the 
middle-aged woman behind one of 
the desks were the only people in 
the place. 

"Section K,” he said briefly. 

She pressed buttons on a viewer 
file beside her, and he realized, in- 
credulously, that she was looking 
up the location of Section K. 

"Section K comes under the Re- 
search Group,” she said finally. 
"Go to B7134 — and take it from 
there,” she added with a wintry 
smile. 

"Thank you.” At the end of the 
entrance hall, a passage at right 
angles bad wall signs and arrows 
indicating A-M and N-Z. He took 
the first. 

For such an enormous building, 
the Department seemed singularly 
deserted. Only occasionally did he 
meet a typist or an office boy cross- 
ing the miles of corridors. After 
walking several hundred yards he 
found and entered the B section. 

All the doors, the infinity of doors 
were blank and no sound came from 
within. 



SIX GATES TO LIMBO 



129 




Then, suddenly, everything was 
easy. At another desk, facing an- 
other middle-aged woman, he knew 
he had to give a password. He said: 
“Rex.” 

In no time at all he was shown 
into the office of John Hilton, the 
section chief. 

TTilton, a quiet little man with 
^ gray hair and watchful eyes, 
came to him with hand oustretch- 
ed in greeting. 

“Glad to see you, Rex,” he said 
cautiously. “Surprised, but glad.” 
His grasp was soft and warm. 
“Why surprised?” 

“You weren’t expected for at 
least another five years. Sooner or 
later you had to investigate Section 
K. It was presumed you’d explore 
the six available worlds first. Did 
you?” 

“We had a look at them.” 

“You and ...” 

“Regina and Venus.” 

“Oh. Venus too.” 

Hilton’s eyes, if anything, had 
become even more watchful. He 
went back to his desk and waved 
Rex to a chair, yet all the time 
Rex felt he was watching for some- 
thing ... or perhaps everything. 
“Hilton, who am I?” 

Hilton was silent, questioning. 
Rex had to give him a reason for 
answering that before he would ans- 
wer. 

“I know I’m a Twentyman — ” 
“Wrong.” 



“I’m a Twentyman,” said Rex 
patiently, “and so is Regina and so 
is Venus.” 

“Wrong. Regina is a Twentyman. 
You and Venus are Millionmen. 
The only two in existence.” 

U A h,” said Rex. “Perhaps I un- 
-^ derstand about Venus and 
myself. Tell me about Regina. 
Why is she only a Twentyman?” 
Hilton smiled. “Only a Twenty- 
man?” 

“It’s been harder for her. She’s 
too Earthbound. Happy in Limbo, 
but — ” He stopped. He was not 
handing out information, but seek- 
ing it. “The dominant personality, 
Regina’s dominant personality, was 
borrowed?” 

Hilton nodded, unsurprised this 
time. “I know what you mean. You 
and Venus are yourselves, plus 
999,999 would-be suicides. Regina 
is a Dominant who chose the body 
of one of her nineteen . partners. 
It often happens. Naturally she 
chose the prettiest.” 

“But that made her an uneasy 
amalgam. It’s only now that she’s 
begun to . Never mind, I know 
about that. Now, Hilton — the goal. 
What is it? Why?” 

When Hilton shook his head, Rex 
went on wearily: “Oh, please take 
my word for it I only want to plug 
the holes. I know the goal. We 
had psychological treatment and 
were then sent to Limbo to lose 
our Earth ties. We were given a 



130 



IF 




chance to see six not particularly 
important worlds to find out that 
Doomsday is near, and why. We 
were supposed to decide some- 
thing ought to be done about it, 
and figure out what. All that is 
elementary, and I wouldn’t be here 
if I hadn’t already made up my 
mind what has to be done — ” 
Hilton was really startled this 
time. He was excited too. He 
jumped up and began to pace about. 

“Something can be done? You 
have a plan?” 

“However,” said Rex in the same 
tone, “there are, as I told you, holes 
I want to plug. I can’t guess every- 
thing.” 

He stood up. “Hilton,” he said 
softly, “tell me what I have to 
know.” 

Hilton went behind the desk and 
sat down again. He began to smile. 
“You may be a Millionman, Rex,” 
he said, “but of course I’m a Twen- 
tyman myself. Only a Twentyman. 
But you’ll find it’s no use trying 
to browbeat me.” 

“All right,” said Rex. “Assume 
I’ve decided what to do. Assume 
that, simply as a hypothesis. As- 
sume that I’m going to do what 
I believe has to be done. Don’t you 
think you’d better tell me anything 
I should know before I take the 
first step to implement the plan?” 
“I think you should know it,” 
Hilton said. “But I don’t think 1 
should tell you.” 

“Then who should?” 



“Venus.” 

Rex stood still for several sec- 
onds and then nodded. “Yes. 
That’s right. Venus. Who gave us 
these ridiculous names, by the 
way?” 

“You chose them yourselves,” 
said Hilton mildly. 

“How can I get back?” 

“Now there’s a problem. There’s 
a Gateway between this building 
and the place you call Limbo, of 
course.” 

“I guessed that.” 

“But it can be locked shut on 
Limbo, and it is. You can’t use 
that.” 

“Venus might have told me. A 
lot of trouble could have been 
saved.” 

“Venus probably doesn’t know. 
When you get back, remind her of 
Ron and Phyllis.” 

“Regina and me?” said Rex 
quickly. 

Hilton shook his head. “Tell her 
of the time she turned her back. 
Remind her she was tricked into 
being the first Millionman. If she 
sounds bitter, remind her that it 
was she who decided there should 
be one other Millionman — you.” 
“That’s all?” 

“It should be enough.” 

“How do I get back to Limbo?” 
Hilton leaned back in his chair. 
“Well, Limbo is on a poisonous, 
useless, sterile world that marches 
round an uninteresting sun in an 
unvarying orbit. It’s impossible for 



SIX GATES TO LIMBO 



131 




any ordinary ship to land on the 
world — Limbo, as you may have 
guessed, is a bubble sanctuary, a 
sort of immobile luxury space- 
houseboat. It was created as an ex- 
periment quite independent of the 
things which have been concerning 
you. We took it over later. Anyway, 
you can return only through one of 
the seven MT screens, and the di- 
rect one is locked.” 

“That means I have to get to 
Bullan or Cresta or Neri or ... ” 
“Just a minute.” Hilton pressed 
a button. “I’ll see what can be 
done.” 

XV 

Tt was not far to the house from 
the Cresta Gateway. Rex was 
nearly there when Regina came 
running to throw herself in his 
arms, laughing and crying at once. 

Presently he held her back to 
look at her, and marveled. She had 
completely lost her former glossy 
smartness. Having a child to look 
after had made her settle for prac- 
tical neatness rather than bandbox 
elegance. She wore a white sweater 
and white shorts and flat shoes, 
and her hair was simply caught in 
a band. But she was far lovelier, 
and Rex realized, even if she her- 
self did not have the important 
clue, that she was at last one in 
mind and body, having come to 
accept herself as she was. 

“The baby?” he said. 



“Princess? Crawling in the grass 
at the back. We made a playpen, 
Venus and I.” 

“Princess?” said Rex. 

“That needn’t be her name. 
Since we hadn’t decided on a name 
together, I called her that — it’s 
pretty obvious, isn’t it, though may- 
be it should have been in Latin — 
as a sort of pet name, one we can 
always use even though we call her 
Dawn or Mary or Venetia — ” 

“Venetia?” 

She laughed again. “Oh well. 
We’ll talk it over, of course . she 
just seems like a little Venetia to 
me.” 

At the house they found Venus 
patiently waiting for them, curious, 
naturally, but taking it for granted 
that Rex would want to see Prin- 
cess first of all. Princess, or Vene- 
tia, was really an unusually beau- 
tiful child, he decided, and re- 
markably healthy. The moment he 
saw her he changed his mind, like 
so many other fathers, and told 
himself he hadn’t really wanted a 
son after all. 

Left alone after lunch while 
Venus and Regina attended to 
Princess and settled her for her 
afternoon nap — apparently it took 
two of them to do it — Rex went 
down to the cellar and then the 
vault. At the wall board he did 
what the technicians of Section K 
had told him to do, after Hilton 
reluctantly agreed. Basically the 
effect was to merge the Chuter and 



132 



IF 




Cresta Gateways, so that people on 
the Cresta side found themselves 
in Chuter direct, without having to 
touch Limbo. There were ways in 
which he could still use both Gate- 
ways himself, and return to Limbo. 
Without real understanding, he did 
as he had been told. The job would 
not have been difficult but for the 
fact that he had felt it necessary 
to know from the equipment here 
how many people were making use 
of the Gateway. Through the girl at 
the immigration center, they would 
know now what to do — but would 
they do it? 

It was late in the afternoon be- 
fore he left the vault and sought 
out Regina and Venus. 

T T e found Venus in the kitchen, 
* * preparing something very ela- 
borate for dinner, no doubt in hon- 
or of his return. He began to feel 
hungry at once. 

“Where’s Regina?” he asked. 

“At the lake with Princess.” 

Venus was working with a quick- 
ness and assurance which was en- 
tirely like her, but her obvious 
total command of the kitchen was 
something new. 

“You do the cooking now?” he 
said. 

“Some of it.” 

“You were never as good a cook 
as Regina.” 

“Now that’s not very nice, Rex. 
I always do my best.” 

“But now you are.” 



“She and I have been working 
in the kitchen. I may have picked 
up a few things.” 

“She couldn’t teach you a thing. 
And you know it.” 

Venus wiped her hands, took £ 
last look round to see that all was 
well and drew him with her into the 
lounge. 

“They told you?” she said quiet- 
ly- 

Rex was almost certain that she 
was talking about something he 
had not been told, but hazily 
guessed. 

“Not exactly,” he said. “Hilton 
told me you would tell me.” 

“But you know?” 

“Please, Venus,” he said, “let’s 
have no more sparring. Hilton told 
me to remind you of Ron and 
Phyllis — ” 

“Oh.” There was sadness in her 
face. 

“And of the time you turned 
your back.” 

Now the sadness was pain. “Rex, 
I wonder if you know what you’re 
doing to me,” she said. 

“I don’t, but it seems I have to 
do it. I was to remind you you were 
tricked into being the first Million- 
man.” 

Bleakly she murmured: “That’s 
something I don’t need reminding 
about. It’s something I remember- 
ed even as I looked at the cases 
and read the labels Rex, Regina 
and Venus.” 

“Hilton said,” Rex went bn, “ ‘if 



SIX GATES TO LIMBO 



133 




she sounds bitter, remind her that 
It was she who decided there should 
be one other Millionman — you.’ ” 
The sadness and the pain was 
gone, replaced by resignation that 
jwas almost her old serenity. “Yes,” 
she said. “And I’m almost sure I 
made up for everything with that. 
You’re not as I thought you’d be, 
Rex. You’re not tortured, like me.” 
“Tortured? You?” 

“The Millionman experiment was 
not a success. Twentymen, yes. 
[They’re not perfect, they’re not 
geniuses, yet the relatively few 
[Twentymen in the galaxy are hold- 
ing Doomsday back.” 

Rex nodded. “I’ve seen that.” 
“Talking isn’t one of my favorite 
occupations, Rex. You know that. 
What do you want?” 

“That’s the trouble. I don’t 
know.” 

“So you want me to tell you what 
I think you should know.” 

“Yes.” 

’ “That would amount to my 
jclirecting you.” 

“You said talking isn’t your fav- 
orite occupation. Why not tell me 
in about three sentences the plain 
facts that you know and I don’t, 
and let me worry about the use 
to make of them?” 

“I could . Rex, do you know 
what has to be done?” 

“Yes.” He didn’t say, “I think 
so.” He said simply, “Yes.” 
“Anything more I tell you may 
make it harder for you to do what 



has to be done. Think about that.” 

He hesitated. He thought of 
Regina and Princess. And he found 
an excuse or even a good reason to 
wait for a few more days. 

He wanted to know about the 
Crestans. What they did could be 
the crucial point. Did they realize 
that they must disobey earth’s rul- 
ing and go to Chuker? 

He was already certain what had 
to be done. But there was one more 
test. 

“I’ll wait,” he said. “But it has 
to come — you know that.” 

“I know that,” said Venus. The 
pain was back in her eyes. 

Even Cresta, the most indepen- 
dent world he had found, was a 
dependent. A dependent relative. 
Not a world with courage and 
freedom of action. There was no 
such world. They had a chance of 
life, but they found Earth’s dis- 
pleasure. 

And finally one day he talked 
to Venus, again when Regina set 
off with Princess for the lake. He 
set out clearly what he wanted to 
know, and she told him. 

She was right — it made it hard- 
er. At the same time, however, 
what she told him crystallized 
everything. 

As a young but highly regarded 
executive in Section K, just mar- 
ried and very happily married, she 
first became involved with Limbo 
(it wasn’t called Limbo, of course). 
Here was a white elephant aban- 



134 



IF 




doned by the section which had 
gone to enormous, expensive trou- 
ble to create it. What could be 
done with it? 

That, at the time, was only a 
minor problem. Her husband Ron, 
also in Section K, was asked to 
become a Twentyman. Asked — 
that was a little unusual. Suicides 
and would-be Twentymen Domin- 
ants were so common that it was 
rare for anyone not actively think- 
ing of becoming a Twentyman or 
part of a Twentyman to be invited 
into the circle. But Ron, Section 
K thought, would be more useful 
to them as a Twentyman. 

He went to the clinic at the 
appointed time, a routine affair. 
Nothing ever went wrong. The pro- 
cess was well established. 

But Ron died. So did the others. 

Phyllis, or Venus as Rex still 
thought of her, was shattered. She 
was pregnant at the time, and she 
was a one-man woman. There would 
never be another man for her. While 
her baby was growing in her, she 
worked, since she had to work on 
something, on the Limbo project. 

And she achieved cold, brilliant 
success. 

A cold, brilliant overseer was 
needed. The human race was in a 
sorry mess. Population explosions 
had led to frantic colonization of 
the galaxy, but nobody had guessed 
what would follow that . 

Section K had had a plan for Ron 
and later, when that failed, Venus. 



A special Twentyman with all ties 
broken might see the Answer, if 
there was an Answer. After Ron’s 
death Venus took over, for some- 
thing to do. 

Venus had learned by this time 
that Ron had been meant to be a 
Thousandman, the first ever. And 
something had gone wrong. 

Coldly, dispassionately, in a man- 
ner diametrically opposed to her 
essential nature, Venus set up the 
project — in her last months of 
pregnancy and before she was even 
a Twentyman. 

Qomeone would be sent to Limbo 
^ alone to live there and lose 
involvement with Earth and the 
human race. The new MT trans- 
ference would be used with deep- 
sleep and certain phychiatric tech- 
niques to ensure that the Supremo 
should have all impersonal knowl- 
edge and no personal knowledge 
whatever. The Supremo would sleep 
perforce for ten years and exist in 
Limbo for another ten. After that, 
the Supremo, it was hoped, would 
know what to do. 

Venus had her baby, a girl, and 
never looked at her. Venus had 
turned her back on everything ex- 
cept Project Supremo, which had 
sustained her for eight months. Now 
she wanted to die, like so many 
others. 

They tricked her by making her 
think she was to be one of the nine- 
teen to feed a Twentyman. Her

baby would be looked after, of 
course. She accepted gladly. 

Instead, she was the Dominant. 
And she was not merely a Twenty- 
man at the end, but a Millionman. 

Nine hundred and ninety-nine 
thousand nine hundred and ninety- 
nine women died willingly to make 
her. She would have screamed at 
the cruelty of the trick that had 
been played on her, but for the 
fact that as a Millionman — there 
was no failure this time — she had 
become a unique being, unable to 
scream about things which could 
not be helped. 

She still abandoned Regina, but 
she went to Limbo instead of to 
heaven or hell. 

On her awakening in Limbo, 
things were different, but not dif- 
ferent enough. She would never for- 
get Ron. She never managed to be- 
come uninvolved, and she knew it. 
Her idea, formed when she was an 
ordinary girl of twenty or so, not 
sound. But she was not the one to 
put it into practice. 

There was only one Gateway 
then, the one to Earth. It was in 
the vault, only to be discovered 
when the occupant of Limbo had 
attained serenity and poise and ice- 
cold clarity. Venus found it at once. 

She did not spend ten years 
awake in Limbo. She spent scarcely 
two. At about the time when Regina 
was fourteen, Venus, who had made 
the Limbo plan, saw the inadequa- 
cies in it and in herself. 



First, she was not the Supremo. 
A man was needed, and not an en- 
tirely lonely man. Such a man, in- 
stead of being utterly impartial, 
was bound to be in some ways more 
involved than ever with the future 
of his race elsewhere. 

Secondly, she knew too much. 
The process intended to divorce 
the Supremo from personal involve- 
ment with the human race had to 
go deeper. He had to remember 
still less. Yet at the same time, he 
had to be able to learn something 
of the situation in the galaxy. He 
had to be able to see it for himself 
and make up his mind about it and 
about what had to be done. She 
did not then know much about MT 
transference, an expensive system 
with many snags. 

So Venus went back to Earth. 
Her old boss was dead, a fact which 
for the good of Project Supremo 
was perhaps as well. She could 
never have, worked at full efficiency 
with the man who had killed Ron 
and tricked her. 

The new chief was John Hilton. 

The new plan took four years to 
work out and put into effect. Venus 
never saw her daughter, never 
sought to see her. And then, when 
the vast Section K computers were 
asked for the names of young men 
and women most fitted to figure in 
the key roles of Proj'ect Supremo, 
one of the first names to issue from 
the machines was that of Venus’s 
daughter.

4 4 "possibly John Hilton arranged 
that deliberately,” she said. 
“He was in on the original plan, as 
a young man. I think he was hor- 
rified at my abandonment of ... I 
may as well go on calling her Re- 
gina. 

“You were a brash young man, 
less assured then and over-confident 
in manner. But I felt sure you were 
right. Regina was curiously root- 
less. My fault. She had known love 
all right, but not from her family. 
And there had been no man in her 
life. She was keen on the idea, as 
a theory — ” 

“Did we ever meet? Regina and 
I?” 

“No. We all agreed, including 
yourselves, that the first meeting 
should be in Limbo. And I was to 
return with you ... I don’t have to 
tell you any more, do I? You know 
all you have to know. Perhaps it 
might be better if you knew a little 
less.” 

Rex knew what she meant, but 
had not been aware that she knew. 

“You’re so young,” he said won- 
deringly. 

She smiled. “I was born in 3607, 
which makes me forty-five. But 
I’ve lived less than thirty years — 
funny, I’ve never bothered to work 
it out. Ten off for my first long 
sleep, a little over five for the sec- 
ond. And deepsleep has a rejuve- 
nating effect. I suppose, practically, 
I’m around twenty-five.” 

“About that I always thought,” 



said Rex. “No wonder it didn’t ex- 
actly spring to my mind that you 
were my mother-in-law.” 

“And yet . you always knew, 
didn’t you?” 

“I knew something.” 

There was a long pause. Both 
knew what was coming, but neither 
was in a hurry to go ahead. 

At last Venus said: “You’ve 
made up your mind, Rex?” 

“Yes.” 

“You’re sure?” 

“I’m certain. The only doubt is 
whether I have to do it myself or 
if it’s possible to ask you.” 

She smiled. “Of course it’s pos- 
sible to ask me. It’s possible to ask 
anyone anything.” 

“Not this.” 

Her smile faded. “I knew all 
along. I created the plan, but I 
couldn’t face the conclusion. No, 
Rex, you needn’t ask. Just tell me 
you’re certain that it’s the only 
way.” 

“It’s the only way.” 

“Right,” she said briskly. “You 
do me credit, Rex. You have the 
moral courage to order what no one 
else could order, and to order some- 
one other than yourself to be the 
one to do it.” 

“It’s no order — ” 

“Now, don’t let me down, Rex. 
After all, I’m not your mother, but 
I created you. You have broad 
shoulders. Take the responsibility, 
and never deny to yourself or any- 
one else that you took it.” 



SIX GATES TO LIMBO

“All right. He smiled faintly. 
“You know, ©f course, that you’re 
not making it difficult for me, 
Venus. You're making it easy.” 

“Let me try to make the other 
part easier for you too. You have 
to stay here. You have to be the 
general who gives the brutal order 
and then sits back and watches. 
That’s why you were created. 
That’s why you’re here. Good-bye, 
Rex.” 

It was so abrupt that he was 
caught off his guard. She kissed him 
lightly and said, as even a Million- 
man mother couldn't help doing: 
“Look after Regina-” 

Then she left him. He forced him- 
self not to move. 

Venus feaew far more of the work- 
ings of Lii^bo than he did, having 
helped to set them up. She would 
return straight to Earth. She knew 
how. 

Tt was only a few minutes lat- 
-*■ er that Regina dashed in. 

“What’s happening?” she asked 
breathlesly. 

* The ESP gifts of Venus and 
Regina were not identical, but they 
shared each other’s special abilities 
to some extent. Venus sensed feel- 
ings, mainly, and Regina things, 
but Regina had clearly sensed some- 
thing far more than the simple fact 
that Venus had gone down to the 
vault, alone. 

“vhiere’s Venetia?” said Rex, 
stalling. 



“She’s sleeping. I left her out- 
side. WJiat’s happened to Venus?” 
Rex found he couldn’t say any- 
thing. He was, as Venus said, the 
general who gave the brutal order 
and then sat back in safety to 
watch. He, and not Venus, was the 
greatest criminal in history, 

“She’s gone,” he said at last. “I 
don’t think we’ll ever see her again. 
That’s what you wanted, isn’t it?” 
“Did you send her away?” 

“I didn’t have to. She knew what 
she had to do.” 

“Because of us?” 

He shook his head. “Nothing so 
unimportant as the convenience of 
two people.” 

“Well, tell me!” 

“How do you feel about VfeptUs 
now, Regina?” 

She shrugged impatiently. “Oh, 
she’s . well, she and I are linked 
somehow. She could be my sister. 
If that’s what you’ve got to tell me, 
don’t pile on the suspense.” 

“She’s your mother.” 

Regina drew in her breath. She 
had not expected that. Yet once she 
heard it, it made so much sense to 
her that she didn’t argue, didn’t 
protest about any of the difficul- 
ties, such as the curiosity of a 
twenty-five-year-old girl having a 
daughter of nineteen. 

“Well, we’re straight now,” she 
said at last. “I think everything’s 
been put right between us. Come 
to that, I never did or said any- 
thing to her I might regret for the 

IP 



138 




rest of my life. And I did throw 
the switch, the first time I had the 
chance.” 

“Didn’t you know all along?” 
“No,” she said frankly. “There 
were times when I hated her.” There 
were tears in her eyes. 

“I must go and see if Venetia is 
all right,” she said, jumping up. 

Princess was Venetia now; they 
had never agreed on it, it was taken 
for granted. And Rex was glad that 
that had been established even be- 
fore they knew that Venetia was 
Venus’s granddaughter. Occasion- 
ally they called her Princess. That 
would stick too. 

When Regina came back she was 
thoughtful again. 

u Venus has gone, you said. By 
way of the vault?” 

“To Earth.” 

“There’s another Gateway, then?” 
Rex now had an easy way to stall 
for a while. He told her what Venus 
had told him. But at the end . 

Regina faced him. “What’s this 
thing she’s gone to do?” 

“Destroy Earth,” said Rex quiet- 
ly* 

XVI 

'T'he words didn’t register. Re- 
gina stared at him blankly. 
“Isn’t it as obvious to you as it 
was to her and to me?” said Rex 
haftbly. “Some sons and daughters 
never cut loose from their mother’s 
apron strings. That’s what hap- 



pened with the children of Mother 
Earth. 'They weren’t forced, like 
you, to live for the. whole of their 
childhood and adolescence without 
a father and without a mother. The 
umbilical cord was never cut. They 
went on depending on Earth. The 
children of Earth, all over the gal- 
axy never grew up, because Earth 
was so big, so powerful, so efficient 
in the early stages that it was never 
necessary for them to grow up. 
Those settlements that did cut 
themselves off failed, perhaps by 
chance, perhaps by — ” 

“Destroy Earth?” said Regina in- 
credulously. 

“We’ve seen six of the colonies. 
Bullan, apathetic. Cresta, desper- 
ate. Chuter, selfc canceled because 
Earth didn’t come back to help. 
Landfall — ” 

“Never mind about Landfall. I 
was there. You weren’t.” She pause 
“You really mean — ” 

“There’s only one way to do it.” 
“The most inhuman mass murder 
in history?” 

“Yes.” 

“And Venus agreed?” 

“We didn’t discuss it. She knew.” 
“You sent her?” 

Rex didn’t even wince. “She 
went.” 

“To do what, exactly? What were 
your instructions?” 

“I told you, there were no in- 
structions. She knew.” 

“Don’t keep saying that!” 

“She went to Earth. That’s all.” 



SIX GATES TO LIMBO 



139 




Regina jumped up. “Destroy 
Earth? That will be easy, of course. 
All she’ll have to do is buy a fire- 
work. Why, it’s nonsense. How 
could she possibly — ” 

They looked at each other, sud- 
denly close again. Venus was no 
ordinary woman. Whatever had to 
be done, she would be able to do. 
She didn’t have to be instructed. 
She would find a way to do it. 

“But she’ll come back,” whis- 
pered Regina. 

Rex shook his head. “You know 
better. If she destroyed Earth, could 
she allow herself to escape before 
the end? No. She’ll stay. So would 
I.” 

Regina was suddenly furious. 
“But you let her go, and didn’t go 
yourself? Even if it’s necessary . 
Well, maybe for the greatest good 
for the greatest number it might 
be. How should I know? I’m only 
a Twentyman. Rex — we’ve got to 
stop her.” 

Regina’s sudden appeal was to 
him as her husband. He followed 
her as she ran to the cellar, raced 
down the stone steps scarcely 
touching them, and leaped into her 
case . 

It didn’t move. She shut the lid 
behind her, opened it, stared at Rex 
frantically, shut it again. 

Rex tried his own. It didn’t move 
either. And Venus’s case was locked. 

“Break it open!” Regina ex- 
claimed. 

There was nothing in the cellar 



with which to do this. Rex went 
with Regina to the workshop. There 
he caught her in his arms gently 
but firmly. 

“Regina. This is no use.” 
“Maybe, but we’ve got to try, 
haven’t we?” 

“No. Venus wanted to go.” 
“Wanted to? Nonsense. How 
could anyone want to?” 

“She knew it had to be done. She 
knew she had to do it. I was created 
merely to confirm what she knew.” 
“If a mere Twentyman like me 
can’t commit suicide, how can a 
Millionman like her?” 

“Regina.” His voice was no 
longer urgent, but soft. “You were 
right. This was what you saw. What 
you knew. Why you fought explor- 
ation of the Gateways all along. 
Yet you knew, as you fought, that 
it couldn’t be stopped.” 

“It?” 

“What Venus calls Project Su- 
remo.” 

“And you,” she said bitterly, 
freeing herself to step back and 
look at him, “are the Supremo.” 
“No.” 

“What do you mean, no?” 
“Venus is and always was behind 
it. We’re part of Venus’s plan. We 
were needed, I was needed, as a 
switch is needed. You don’t com- 
plete the circuit as you build a re- 
lay. You include a switch so that 
when the time is right, someone 
can.” 

“A switch,” she whispered. 



140 



IF 




“Yes, sl switch. I was the switch. 
At the right time.” 

“I did know.” 

He said nothing. 

She said quietly. “All right, so 
I’m in it too. In her plan, I mean. 
When I saw the switch on her 
plinth, I knew it would be far bet- 
ter for all of us if it was never 
touched. But I knew I had to close 
the switch, and I did it. So ... ” 

Her eyes were full of tears. “I 
think I knew then that by reviving 
Venus, I was killing her. And yet 
I had to do it.” 

Rex kissed her very gently. He 
did not feel like a murderer. 

'T'wo months later they found 
the way to the vault again open 
to them. But when they got there, 
there was no sign of any Gateway 
to Earth. That remained Venus’s 
secret. 

And there was nothing Regina 
could do. 

It was not until after Prince was 
born (they called him Ron and 
sometimes Prince, as they called 
his sister Venetia and sometimes 
Princess) that the relay set up in 
the vault showed that the Cresta- 
Chuter Gateway had been used 
at last. First a few went to Chuter. 
Then a pause. Then some of them 
returned. Then many began to use 
the Gateway. 

“Now they know Earth is gone.” 

It wasn’t Rex who said that, it 
was Regina. 



And it was Rex who said: “Venus 
is gone too.” 

“Well,” said Regina, with the 
brutal practicality of a mother of 
* two, “she left me for nineteen 
years. I must try to remember that. 
Before I abandoned Prince and 
Princess, something would have to 
happen to me that ...” 

She shuddered. “She was a love- 
ly woman. But I believe now some 
of the things you told me just after 
she left. Her life must have been 
over before we ever knew her. Be- 
ing a Millionman, maybe she was 
glad of a great, important, unan- 
swerable, unavoidable excuse to 
die.” 

It was a strange epitaph, and it 
might have been better expressed. 
But Rex thought there had seldom 
been a truer one. And Regina said 
it. 

They were happy. Regina never 
left Limbo, would never leave Limbo 
again. Rex went to one of the Gate- 
way worlds only occasionally, to 
keep in touch with events in the 
galaxy. What he saw was good, and 
he was pleased. Any surgeon who 
cut off a leg would be glad to have 
it confirmed that the leg was in- 
curably diseased. 

He had to keep on watching 
what was going on. 

He would always have to watch 
what was going on. 

Some day he might be needed 
again.

notion, follow humbly wherever 
and to whatever abysses Nature 
leads, or you shall learn nothing. , 
The scientists must recognize that 
he still is a layman in every field 
but one. And in that one field he 
must accept the consequences of 
his actions, reckoning the human 
payment for every change and com- 
municating broadly the informa- 
tion that is peculiarly his own. I 
do not say it; the gulf between the 
people and the scientists de- 
mands it.” 

“You claim that they are a sep- 
arate breed?” 

“Their attitudes set them apart; 
their common interests and their 
common heritage must bring them 
back together. The scientist is 
rational man at work. The mob is 
irrational, wherein lies the ultimate 
terror for the reasoning man.” 

“Now you are calling the people 
irrational!” 

“Only when they act like a mob 
or when, like the scientist when he 
is out of his laboratory, they are 
sentimentalists. The sentimentalist 
is the person who wants to eat his 
cake and have it, too. G. K. 
Chesterton once said about him, 
‘He has no sense of honor about 
ideas; he will not see that one must 
pay for an idea as for anything else. 
He will have them all at once in 
one wild intellectual harem, no 
matter how much they quarrel.’ ” 



l^elley studied the audience and 
^ the jury and then looked back 
at Wilson. “Science never has reck- 
oned the consequences for any of 
its actions or computed the human 
payment that must be made. Why 
should it start now?” 

“Men once never herded cattle 
or tilled the land or lived in cities 
or traveled in airplanes. Tribes once 
killed every stranger. Kings once 
cut off the heads of the bearers 
of ill tidings. Senators once were 
elected by state legislatures.” 

“Are you trying to tell us that 
men change?” Kelley asked. 

“That is obvious to everyone ex- 
cept the cynic. Men can change. 
And they do. This is not only a 
possibility for the individual and 
a necessity for society but a his- 
torical inevitability. Our perspec- 
tive is too short for us to recognize 
the phenomenon in action, but men 
evolve. We can see it happening 
more swiftly in our social institu- 
tions.” 

“How do you think men are 
changing, Wilson?” 

Wilson smiled. Kelley was will- 
ing to let him convict himself out 
of his own mouth, not only before 
the jury here in the courtroom but 
before the broader jury of the 
nation. But it was more important 
to Wilson that he get these con- 
cepts on the record — not just for 
now, important as it was, but for 
the years to come. 

“Surpluses slow down the process 



142 



IF 




of change,” Wilson said. “Short- 
ages speed it up. Necessity is not 
only the mother of invention but 
evolution. Surpluses are created by 
advancing stages of civilization, and 
population expands to consume 
them. When primitive man pro- 
gressed from nut and fruit gather- 
ing to the hunting of concentrated 
sources of protein on the hoof, he 
had extra food with which he could 
feed the child which once might 
have been sacrificed to starvation. 

“When the hunter became the 
farmer and the herder, the process 
of selection became slowed even 
more. He could nurse the sick as 
well as feed the unable and the 
unwilling. The coming of the ma- 
chine and industrialization brought 
further surpluses and the further 
development of morality and ethics 
and the religions that glorify weak- 
ness. Evolution is further slowed.” 

“Are you now attacking the 
Christian religion?” Kelley asked 
sharply. 

TX7ilson waited until the roar of 
* * the audience died away. 
“Other religions do the same thing.” 
The roar returned. “Moreover, I 
am a Christian — though, to be 
sure, a Unitarian. Christianity is 
one of the finest ethical and moral 
philosophies man ever had con- 
ceived, but it is a philosophy bred 
of surpluses. It could never have 
been possible to a tribe living on 
the narrow edge ©f starvation. 



“The concern of that tribe is for 
the traits that will promote survival 
in this life, not in the next. That 
tribe’s religious rites are basically 
evolutionary. When man was re- 
cently separated from his apelike 
ancestors, many throwbacks must 
have been born. They had to be 
weeded out.” 

“How, Wilson?” 

Again Kelley was leading him, 
Wilson thought. Let him lead as 
long as the ideas came out. “The 
rite of manhood was the principal 
method ‘ — not merely adulthood 
but manhood. As soon as the child 
was old enough to have reached dis- 
cretion, he was subjected to some 
ritualistic torture or feat of endur- 
ance. Scars were scratched into his 
body and face; lips and earlobes 
were distended by progressively 
larger plugs; food was withheld or 
voluntarily abjured. This was true 
of the American Indian. And even 
in some of the countries considered 
more civilized it was part of the 
rites preceding knighthood. 

“All of these rites stressed a com- 
mon element — present sacrifice 
for future good, something no ani- 
mal can comprehend, something 
only the human can consciously 
achieve. Imagine a tribal meeting 
around a campfire. The adolescent 
stands straight before the fire, hop- 
ing he can endure what lies ahead, 
anticipating the joys of manhood if 
he can come through without dis- 
grace. The chief or the witch doctor

picks up a burning brand from the 
fire and hands it to the boy, flames 
toward him. If the boy is human 
he accepts it, lets it bum him to 
prove that he is fit to join the adults 
of the tribe. If he is animal, if he 
is not fit, he refuses to take it or 
lets it drop. And he is killed. Or 
he is killed genetically by the re- 
fusal of any young woman of the 
tribe to mate with him.” 

“Are you suggesting,” Kelley 
asked, “that the American people 
return to that kind of tribal rite?” 

“The time when that would have 
been effective has passed. We have 
other tribal rites, only they are not 
as effective in producing the desired 
results. The greatest examples of 
present sacrifice for future good are 
found in religion. And its greatest 
symbol is Christ on the Cross. To 
day we need a new device, a new 
evolutionary pressure or a new rite 
to select the men and women who 
are capable of living in close as- 
sociation with the machine.” 

“Why should we wish to do that 
Kelley asked. “Why not merely 
destroy the machines and return to 
a better life?” 

“Some always want to go back,” 
Wilson said patiently. “Serfs who 
cannot accept industrialization, 
hunters who constitutionally can- 
not tie themselves to a single plot 
of ground, nut gathers who can’t 
eat meat, animals who will not suf- 
fer now to live better later. But 
you can’t go back. A least you 



can’t go back as you are. You go 
back decimated. This world cannot 
support more than a few hundred 
million people by primitive agri- 
culture alone. If you discard the 
machines, four billion of you out 
there will die.” 

IX 

'T'he jury came upright in its 
chairs. The audience looked 
startled, and men and women turned 
to one another to murmur. Kelley 
jerked his head squarely enough to 
talk to Wilson. “Scare talk! That’s 
the kind of unprovable predictions 
with which scientists always have 
tried to get what they want. You 
can’t trust a scientist. We’ve found 
that out.” 

“There is enough evidence to 
prove everything I have said,” Wil- 
son said, “but proof really is un- 
necessary. Simple logic will tell you 
that I am right. Simple logic will 
tell you, too, that man is perfect- 
ible. He can go on to greater works, 
greater glories, greater humanity. 
In every one of you,” Wilson said, 
turning to the jury and then to the 
audience and the cameras, “is that 
potential. The only requirement is 
the willingness to accept the burn- 
ing brand, to let yourself be nailed 
to the cross of your own convictions. 
This thought, and the hope of get- 
ting it across, was the real reason 
I gave myself up.” 

“Are you comparing yourself to 



144 



IF 




Christ?” Kelley snapped back. 

“God help me,” Wilson said, “I 
hope not.” 

17" elley hesitated and then turned 
-***to the judge. “Your honor, I 
request that this session be ad- 
journed and that this cross-exam- 
ination be continued tomorrow.” 
Youngman was on his feet much 
quicker than Wilson ever had seen 
him move before. “Your honor, I 
see no grounds for this unusual 
request. The session is scarcely an 
hour old. If the assistant prosecutor 
wishes to conclude his cross-exam- 
ination, we will consent. If not, I 
ask that he be instructed to con- 
tinue.” 

“The witness has been question- 
ed for a considerable time,” Kelley 
said smoothly. “My request was 
only out of consideration for him.” 
“I feel fine,” Wilson said. He 
glanced at Youngman. The lawyer 
nodded encouragingly. “Tomorrow, 
when the Subcommittee’s doctors 
get through with me, I may not feel 
so well.” 

The judge looked from Young- 
man to Kelley to Wilson, his lips 
pursed. He glanced quickly to his 
left and said, “Continue.” 

“Wilson,” Kelley said without 
hesitation, “you have called for a 
new selection process by which 
men will be chosen for this new 
world of yours. Are these to be 
supermen — like you?” 

“Like me, perhaps,” Wilson said 



quietly. “I have enough vanity to 
think that I might be qualified to 
live in a changing world, to adapt 
to its demands and to pass along 
my talents to children that some- 
day I might have. But not super- 
men. No more than the farmer was 
a superman to the hunter or the 
mechanic to the farmer.” 

“And where will these supermen 
be selected,” Kelley asked, sneer- 
ing, “in the universities?” 

Kelley had not been corrected, 
and Wilson supposed he never 
would be. No matter what anyone 
said, the concept would stick. 
“Some were far a while. College 
graduates, on the whole, were more 
successful in their society. They 
made more money, accumulated 
more authority, and sometimes 
passed along their traits and their 
power to their children, who also 
went to college. A greater propor- 
tion of the population was going 
on to higher education. They were 
becoming a majority, which might 
have meant a new plateau of selec- 
tivity; but, unfortunately, higher 
education wasn’t adaptable to 
everybody’s needs. More important, 
it was not responsive to the needs of 
the future. And it was somewhat 
lacking in the needs of the pre- 
sent. The universities became iso- 
lated from society, intellectually 
inbred, and the things for which 
they were selecting their students 
were idle intellectual pastimes riot 
the world outside.”

“I had not expected you to 
provide the justification for the 
burning of the universities by 
the people,” Kelley said. “You 
know, of course, that the na- 
tion’s tax-free colleges and uni- 
versities and the tax-free philan- 
thropic foundations that help sup- 
port them now control nearly one- 
third of all he produtcive proper- 
ty in the nation.” 

“I have heard that statement.” 
“How can you justify that kind 
of selfish use of private property?” 

C4T can’t because I don’t believe 
it,” Wilson said, “although the 
amount of property controlled by 
the 2,000 or so colleges and uni- 
versities must be substantial. Even 
if it were true* it would be human 
and not diabolical. Education 
should be everyone’s responsibil- 
ity to himself and to his children 
and collectively through these to 
his neighbor and his neighbor’s 
children. He should pay for it daily 
or at least annually. But it is hu- 
man to forget to pay, and it is 
human to those placed in charge of 
education to amass wealth for their 
institutions for protection against 
the public’s neglect. Just as it is 
human for men and women in this 
audience and perhaps even on the 
jury itself to condemn me for a 
crime in which they themselves 
participated — and honestly be- 
lieve that I am guilty.” 

After the uproar subsided, Wil- 



son added, “What your question 
means to me, or course, Is that you 
and Senator Bartlett have the same 
economic reason for burning the 
universities as King Henry Vin 
and his fellow rulers had for con- 
fiscating church lands in the Mid- 
dle Ages,” Wilson smiled. “My 
former colleagues in economics 
would be smiling if they were 
here.” 

“I do not care what your former 
colleagues would be doing,” Kelley 
said savagely, “nor what this ques- 
tion means to you. Nor does this 
excellent jury that you have slan- 
dered with your filthy accusations 
or the vast American audience care 
for this farcical justification for 
your criminal actions. A man on 
trial for his life should not be 
cynical.” 

“A prosecuting attorney should 
not be making speeches during 
cross-examination,” Wilson said. 

Kelley turned off his anger as 
quickly as he had turned it on. “I 
understand that you are a sociol- 
ogist, Wilson.” 

“A physicist and then a sociolo- 
gist.” 

“What is a sociologist?” 

“He is concerned with the devel- 
opment and evolution of society.” 

“He wants to know why groups of 
people act the way they do?” 

“That’s part of what he wants to 
know.” 

“And what if he should find out, 
Wilson?” 



146 



IF 




“People could construct better 
societies. They could learn how to 
live together without conflict and 
frustration, getting out of society 
the satisfactions they need and 
putting back the fuel that society 
needs.” 

“You mean, don’t you, that so- 
ciologists could construct societies 
they thought were better?” 

■\T7ilson said, “You turn to a 
* * doctor when you are sick be- 
cause he knows more about sickness 
and health.” 

“And knowledge is power, isn’t it, 
Wilson? If I know why a group 
of people does something it is only 
a small step farther to knowing 
how to make the people do it — 
or do something else.” 

“Well, yes,” Wilson admitted, 
“but sociologists wouldn’t — ” 
“Why wouldn’t they? Wouldn’t 
you construct a better society if 
you could, a society in which the 
universities would not burn?” 

“I suppose — ” 

“Are the rest of us to trust our 
lives to the benevolence and wis- 
dom of the sociologists? Or the 
psychologist? If a psychologist 
knows why a person acts the way 
he does — if he really knows in- 
stead of guessing a little better a 
little more often than the average 
person — the next thing he can do 
is make a person act that way, or 
some other way. Give a psycholo- 
gist that power and you take away 



free will from the rest of us. People 
don’t want that to happen. You 
don’t want it, Wilson. I don’t want 
it. Nobody wants to be a puppet; 
they want to be people; they want 
to make their own choices, their 
own mistakes. They don’t want to 
live somebody’s else’s idea of the 
good life.” 

“Nobody wants — ” 

“How do you know what nobody 
wants? You want to build a better 
society. The psychologist wants to 
build a better person. But who 
knows how to build a better sociol- 
ogist, a better psychologist? Who 
knows how sensible you are? How 
sane you are? Who gave you the 
power? The people do not want 
you to know that much about 
them. Before they let you know 
that much they will bum you!” 
Kelley’s voice had climbed stead- 
ily until it was almost a scream at 
the end. 

Wilson looked at him in amaze- 
ment. “What you are saying is that 
ignorance is preferable to knowl- 
edge. It may be bliss, but it is a 
dangerous bliss that threatens its 
neighbor as well as itself.” 

But very few could have heard 
Wilson. The courtroom was in an 
uproar. The judge’s gavel was 
banging on his bench. 

At last, when relative quiet re- 
turned, Wilson said, “You are talk- 
ing about mere animal survival; 
I’m talking about the glory of being 
human.” 



TRIAL BY FIRE

Kelley’s voice was deceptively 
mild. “That is your own coat you 
are wearing, isn’t it?” 

Wilson looked down, surprised. 
He fingered* the lapel where he 
had once, in a moment of lucidity, 
concealed a razor blade. The blade 
was gone now. “Yes, I think so.” 

elley stepped forward and put 
-l^his hand on the breast pocket. 
He pulled down hard. 

The pocket ripped — so artfully 
that Wilson thought it must have 
been carefully prepared for this 
moment. With the pocket came 
much of the jacket front. It re- 
vealed what had been concealed be- 
tween the layers of cloth — a fan 
of thin, insulated wires. So much 
had happened since he put them 
there that he had forgotten, but 
Wilson remembered now the device 
he had gimmicked together in the 
desperation of his flight, a gadget 
adapted from his research which 
would pick up primitive theta 
brain-rhythms in his immediate 
vicinity. The hearing aid he had 
attached to the antenna had long 
ago been discarded. He didn’t need 
it now to pick up the theta rhythms 
of the audience, rapid, pounding . 

“Here is not merely a sociolo- 
gist!” Kelley was screaming. “Here 
is a scientist with a machine for 
reading minds — and perhaps, God 
forbid, for making others do his 
will!” 

The audience roared in animal 



fury. They were out of their ben- 
ches, fighting toward the railing. 
In spite of his training Wilson 
shrank back in his chair. But there 
was a man, a single man, who stood 
between him and the crowd — not 
Kelley, who had pulled back in 
front of the jury, but a man who 
had been sitting in the group behind 
Wilson’s table. Senator Bartlett 
himself, in his threadbare coat and 
his ragged blue shirt open at 'the 
collar, held back the crowd. 

“Gentlemen,” he implored in his 
unctuous voice. “Ladies! This man 
is on trial in a court of law. No 
matter how heinous his crime, he 
deserves a fair American trial. Not 
only the nation but the world is 
watching. He must be convicted 
legally, not lynched by a mob.” 

Slowly they fell under the mes- 
meric spell of his singsong phrases. 
The television cameras came up 
close to study Bartlett’s face. Wil- 
son, however, was not present for 
the end of the scene. Guards had 
closed around him, hustled him out 
the door with the frosted glass and 
then out the back way and into the 
waiting truck. In a moment it had 
pulled away and was speeding to- 
ward the highway, leaving the old 
courthouse behind. 

“Well,” Kelley said, “you gave 
us a little surprise there, didn’t 
you?” Almost pulled it off, too. 
Who got the antidote to you? The 
girl? I suppose. It doesn’t matter, 
though. You’re going to die in a 



148 



IF 




very public and edifying way. Put 
him out, Doc.” 

And someone pressed an anes- 
thetic gun to his arm and pulled 
the trigger. It was a drug for which 
he had received no antidote. Or one 
for which the antidote he had re- 
ceived had worn off. The world 
faded away. 

X 

Qomeone was shaking him by 
^ the shoulder. “Wake up, 
Mac,” said a rough voice. But that 
was not the start of it. Even before 
the shaking and the voice that 
urged him out of his dark isolation, 
he had felt the bite of a needle in- 
to his arm, or his subconscious re- 
membered it. “Shake out of it, fel- 
low,” the voice said impatiently. 
“We gotta go.” 

The sting of his arm had roused 
him out of a vivid dream of that 
world which he now accepted as a 
dream world. He had been standing 
in the imposing entrance of the City 
Hall. Its ceiling towered 40 or 50 
feet above his head. 

Around the edges of the central 
lobby had been the soldiers. Hud- 
dled within the circle formed by 
the soldiers were a hundred spec- 
tators, mostly villagers with a 
sprinkling of ragged city dwellers. 
A soldier stood on either side of 
Wilson. In front of him was the 
dark young man. He sat in a tall 
chair. Between them was a char- 



coal brazier. From the coals that 
glowed in it a thin, almost invisible 
column of smoke spiraled up to be 
lost in the dim heights of the ceil- 
ing. On the coals the large, blunt 
tip of a soldering iron with a wood- 
en handle was beginning to turn 
red. 

“John Wilson, are you a witch?” 
the young man asked in a stem 
voice. The audience drew a deep 
breath. 

“I am what I am,” Wilson said. 

“Are you a witch?” the young 
man asked again. 

“I am a man, no more, no less,” 
Wilson replied. 

“Are you a witch?” the young 
man asked the third time. 

“If I were a witch,” Wilson said, 
“you would not dare my wrath, 
Captain Leonard Kelley.” 

The audience moaned. The 
young man drew back in his chair, 
his index finger and his little finger 
making horns at Wilson with his 
right hand. His face was rigid and 
his eyes narrowed. “If you know 
my name, you know it by witch- 
craft,” he said. “But I do not fear 
your power, nor will I condemn you 
without fair trial. Hold out your 
hand, John Wilson.” 

Wilson held out his right hand. 
Kelley picked up the soldering iron 
and moved it gently through the 
air. Smoke curled from the glowing 
tip. Kelley passed the iron in front 
of Wilson’s face. Wilson could feel 
the radiant heat. 



TRAL BY FIRE 



149 




“If you can hold the iron and 
not be burned,” Kelley said, “you 
are a witch and you will be placed 
in a fire prepared for you in the 
plaza outside until your power is 
overcome. If you do not accept the 
iron, you are a confessed witch and 
you will burn. John Wilson, do you 
confess?” 

“I confess that I seek truth and 
serve the people,” Wilson said, 
“and because of these things I will 
accept the iron.” 

Wilson held out his hand. Kelley 
hesitated and chewed on one side 
of his lower lip. “Take it, then!” 

TTe placed the still-glowing iron 
■*-^in Wilson’s hand. The audi- 
ence groaned and surged forward 
only to be met with the upraised 
weapons of the soldiers. “Calm 
yourselves, friends,” Wilson said 
clearly, although his hand smoked 
and waves of pain coursed up his 
arm toward his head. 

Kelley sank back in his tall chair, 
staring at Wilson with dark eyes, 
his hand covering the lower part 
of his face. 

“And what if I accept the iron 
and burn, Captain Kelley?” Wil- 
son asked. 

“Kill him!” Kelley said. 

The spectators surged forward. 

“You gotta wake up,” said the 
voice again. “We got no time.” 

Wilson opened his eyes and 
looked at his right hand. It was 
pink and unmarred. He wiggled his 



fingers. They moved freely. He had 
only the memory of pain, but it 
still seemed quite real. 

A man was bending over him, 
a man in prison denims of gray and 
dark blue. Beyond him the sliding 
bars that formed the door to his 
cell were pushed back. The door 
was open. Beyond the door was the 
wide corridor between the cell 
block and the stone outside wall, 
lit feebly now against the night by 
light bulbs high in the ceiling. The 
barred windows were dark. 

“We’re breaking out of here,” the 
man said, moving back a little. 
“Strange things’re going on. Men 
have seen fire balls drifting outside 
and one guy said he saw one inside 
the walls. I don’t know why but 
the guards’re gone. Come on, Mac. 
Get up and let’s go.” 

“That’s all right,” Wilson said. 
“I’d just as soon stay here.” 

“Mac, you don’t know what 
you’re saying. They’re gonna hang 
you.” 

“How do you know?” Wilson 
asked, interested. 

The man shrugged, his shaggy 
eyebrows moving high on his fore- 
head. “We heard the radio reports 
on our earphones. No jury could 
do anything but find you guilty, 
the announcer said. That’s the word, 
brother, believe me!” 

“You’d better go on,” Wilson 
said. “I’m going to wait for what- 
ever comes.” 

The other caught his right wrist 

IF 



150 




in a strong right hand. He pulled 
Wilson upright. “You don’t know 
what you’re saying, Mac. We ain’t 
gonna leave nobody here.” 

Wilson pulled his wrist free. 
“Try to understand, fellow. I’m 
conscious, and I’m turning down 
your invitation. I’m grateful for 
your concern, but — ” 

The other’s fist caught him on 
the jaw before he could finish. As 
consciousness fled Wilson could feel 
himself falling. 

XI 

TX7ilson lifted his head as the 
* * men half-carried him down 
the broad steps. Subconsciously he 
counted them as his feet bumped 
down each one. “Forty-two,” he 
said at the bottom and didn’t know 
why he said it. 

Fifty feet from the bottom of the 
steps was a tall guard house shaped 
something like a lighthouse. Wilson 
couldn’t see a guard in it, but he 
thought he saw something else in 
the shadows behind the glass panels 
at the top. Something with one star- 
ing eye and a small red eye beneath; 
but he couldn’t be sure. 

Beside him and around him other 
men were moving. He could feel 
them in the darkness and then he 
saw them clearly as a ball of red 
lightning drifted around the corner 
of the tall penitentiary building 
and passed near them before it 
swerved toward the guard house, 



clung to the knob at the top for a 
few seconds, and dissipated. 

The heat of the evening was op- 
pressive and still, and the clouds 
were low. “Just the night for a 
tornado,” Wilson muttered. 

The group of men in whose midst 
he was moved along turned toward 
a truck parked nearby in the broad 
driveway that circled the guard 
house before it headed back toward 
the distant town. Suddenly men in 
uniform began coming around both 
comers of the building. They came 
endlessly. “Stop!” said a voice 
amplified into a giant’s roar. “Don’t 
move! If you try to escape, you 
will be shot down. Stop where you 
are!” 

Wilson looked back up the steps. 
More men in uniform were coming 
through the doors they just had 
left. One of them carried a por- 
table amplifier held to his mouth. 

Down the long double driveway 
past the guard tower lights began 
to flicker like giant fireflies. The 
men with Wilson didn’t stop. They 
continued toward the tarpaulin- 
covered truck, but others began to 
scatter. Some of them ran to the 
left across the open lawn. Others 
sprinted out to the right. 

“For the last time, I warn you! 
Stop where you are!” said the 
giant’s voice. 

Guns barked. Searchlights came 
on, holding men pinned in their 
beams like butterflies; against a 
black velvet mounting board. Men 



TRAL BY FIRE

crumpled in mid-stride. Others 
staggered on until they, too, were 
knocked to the ground. Some were 
whirled around by the shock of the 
impact. Others turned and held 
their hands in the air. 

The group of men with Wilson 
was almost to the truck now. Just 
before they reached it the tarpau- 
lin in the back parted. The men 
with Wilson stopped. The dark 
young man named Kelley was in 
the back of the truck, and more 
guards and more guns. 

“Here he is,” said the man who 
had been in Wilson’s cell. 

“And here is your reward,” Kel- 
ley said. 

A gun went off and another. The 
^ men near Wilson began to drop 
away. The man who had spoken 
looked to the right and left be- 
wildered. “But you said — ” he be- 
gan, and then he, too, started fold- 
ing himself up. 

In a moment Wilson was stand- 
ing alone. He felt his sore jaw. 
“Aren’t you going to shoot me, 
too?” he asked. 

“We’re going to do better than 
that,” Kelley said and motioned 
toward the driveways. 

The fireflies had turned into 
torches, and the torches were at the 
head of twin crowds of men and 
women. Hoarse voices reached his 
ears. They were singing something. 
Men with portable cameras ran 
along beside the crowds. 



Guards were on either side of 
him. They boosted Wilson into the 
truck and pulled the tarpaulin back 
against the cab. There, his back 
braced against the cab, was Senator 
Bartlett. He did not move as the 
truck started up and pulled slowly 
down the driveway. Wilson stag- 
gered and caught himself. 

“Hello, Senator,” Wilson said. 

Bartlett’s arms were folded across 
his chest. “You’re a strange man, 
Wilson. We could have chosen bet- 
ter.” 

“Everybody agreed he was the 
one,” Kelley said defensively. 

“I’m not blaming anybody,” 
Bartlett said. “But the way things 
turned out, we could have chosen 
better.” 

“I would gladly have had this cup 
pass from me,” Wilson said. 

“You are a blasphemer as well 
as a meddler,” Bartlett said. “No 
wonder the people hate your kind.” 

The voice of the crowd was closer. 
The song they were singing was 
The Battle Hymn of the Republic . 

“They will hate anybody,” Wil- 
son said, “but you have done your 
job well. And profited thereby.” 

The truck stopped, backed in a 
curving path, and turned in another 
curve so that its back was toward 
the crowd. The crowd’s torches cre- 
ated a ragged hemisphere of light. 
Beyond it the blackness struggled to 
return. 

“I do not lead,” Bartlett said, his 
gaze turned inward. “I am pushed. 

IF 



152 




The people tell me what to say and 
what to do, and I say and I do what 
they tell me. They say that the 
eggheads must die if the people are 
to live, and the eggheads will die.” 
It was as if God had spoken. 

Bartlett stepped to the rear of the 
truck to face the crowd. A murmur 
ran through it as the singing died 
away. The murmur turned to cheers 
and shouts of “Senator! Senator!” 

Bartlett held out his arms for si- 
lence. Standing between two guards 
Wilson could see the cameras 
focused on the Senator’s flame-lit 
face and outstretched arms. It was 
a familiar pose. Wilson had seen it 
often on television and in publicity 
shots. It brought back the memory 
of the night the university had 
burned. 

“People!” Bartlett said. He said 
it quietly but his voice carried well. 
Wilson decided that he had a pick- 
up in his artfully threadbare coat. 
The crowd roared and sltwly re- 
turned to silence. “My .people!” 
The crowd roared again. “Disperse, 
I ask you now! Go to your homes! 
Leave this man to the law!” 

“No! No!” the crowd shouted. 
“Burn him.” 

T>eyond the crowd Wilson could 
" see a tall pillar and a pile of 
crates and boards around it, still 
growing as men tossed more wood 
on the pile. 

“I honor your feelings in this 
matter,” Bartlett said. “The man 



did try to escape, to evade his prop- 
er punishment. But I ask you to 
forbear. A second time I ask you, 
leave him to the law” 

“Burn him! Burn him!” 

“This man is guilty,” Bartlett 
said. “We all know that. The ver- 
dict is a formality. But I ask you 
to hold your hand, restrain your 
honest wrath. Leave him to the 
law!” 

“No! No! No!” 

“Then if you must have it so, I 
give this man to you for justice. 
Let him die for what he has done! 
Let him bum for the torment he 
has given others! Let him perish 
along with all others of his kind! 
Let his fiery end be a warning to 
the rest! The people will not be 
ruled by any except themselves. 

“This man is guilty of treason to 
the people. He has betrayed you. 
He has tried to steal your minds 
and twist your thoughts. Let him 
burn!” 

Bartlett ended with his arms 
spread wide once more. His arms 
dropped to his sides, his head 
drooped like a wilting narcissus, 
and he stood aside. Wilson was 
pushed forward by the guards. 

“I can walk,” Wilson said, but 
they would not let him. He was 
shoved from behind, and he fell 
into the crowd. Head high the men 
and women carried him toward the 
post. Hands clutched at his clothing 
and tore pieces of it away and, he 
thought from the twinges of pain, 



TRAL BY FIRE 



153 




pieces of himself as well. 

In a moment they placed him up- 
right against the pillar which was, 
he discovered, an old fence post. 
Someone pulled his arms behind 
the post, tied his hands together, 
and hammered something into the 
post. When he couldn’t move his 
hands up or down he decided that 
the rope had been nailed to the 
post. “Hang on tight!” someone 
said in his ear. Wilson tried to see 
who it was, but the man was gone. 

Then a man came forward with 
a torch. 

“People!” Wilson shouted. They 
quieted slowly, and the man with 
the torch hesitated. 

“Go ahead,” someone urged from 
the back. The man with the torch 
started forward again. 

“I came back,” Wilson shouted, 
“to die if I must. But I did not 
come back wanting to die. I am 
ready to die because we all are 
guilty, but it will not help you to 
kill me. You will be killing part of 
yourselves — the part that thinks, 
the part that makes you human. 
Know what you do! When you 
abandon reason and commit your- 
self to terror, you can be certain of 
only one thing. You will never know 
what tomorrow brings. You may be 
next. You — 

And then the torch plunged into 
the crates and boards at his feet. 
They began to smoke and to 
crackle. In a moment they had 
sprung into flame, and Wilson took 



a deep breath of air before it, too, 
turned into flame. 

TTe was trying to decide whether 
^ it would be better to hold his 
breath as long as possible or to 
breathe in the fire and shorten the 
end when he noticed the crowd stir- 
ring around him, looking behind 
rather than at him. Over their 
heads as they cringed aside came a 
ball of lightning. It came straight 
toward Wilson and settled on the 
post just above his head. 

Wilson could not see it then, but 
he could feel it, electric and almost 
cool, behind him. It must make 
him quite a sight, he thought, as he 
wondered how long it would be be- 
fore the flames began to consume 
his legs. 

Miraculously, however, the post 
began to move, slowly at first and 
then with greater speed, pulling him 
up and away. He felt the strain on 
his shoulders as if they were about 
to be dislocated, and he hugged the 
post tight with all his strength. The 
flames dropped behind, below. He 
could see the faces of the crowd 
looking up at him like curious 
saucers with shadowy eyes and 
noses and mouths painted on them. 

“Shoot!” somebody shouted be- 
low. It sounded like Kelley. “Quick. 
Shoot him!” 

But the barking of the guns was 
seconds too late. He felt a bullet 
pluck at his tattered clothing, and 
then he was into the low-hanging 



156 



IF 




clouds and into something else, and 
hands grabbed him, something cool 
and wet was sprayed onto his legs 
and feet, and he was drawn back 
onto a bench or cot. 

Wilson looked around. He was in 
the belly of some kind of airplane. 
In front of him an open doorway 
in the floor was closing. From the 
way it hovered, Wilson thought it 
must be a helicopter, but it was 
remarkably silent. To his left was a 
man he had known as Pike. In 
front of him was Youngman. To his 
right was Pat Helman looking as 
desirable as ever. 

“Surprised?” Pat Helman said. 

“Pleasantly,” Wilson said. “I 
wasn’t expecting you.” 

“That’s the best kind,” Young- 
man said. 

“That was quite a fireball,” Wil- 
son said. 

“The ball lightning was just for 
show,” Pike said. “A strong black 
wire did the real job, just like in 
the. magic shows.” 

“What were all Bartlett’s and 
Kelley’s last-minute shenanigans 
about?” Wilson asked. 

“They were losing in the court- 
room and on the tube,” Youngman 
drawled. “They had to wind it up 
fast and dramatically or find them- 
selves on the losing side — and 
once those kind start to lose they 
go down fast, like Danton and 
Robespierre.” 

“You’re joking,” Wilson said. 

“You underestimate your powers 



of persuasion,” Pat Helman said. 
“You’re quite a man, John Wilson.” 

Wilson looked at her. “I wonder 
how persuasive I could be.” He 
turned' to Youngman again. “Was 
it worth it? Did we do any good?” 

^vur best estimate is that it will 
slow them down,” Pike said. 
“Nothing will reverse the trend. 
That must wear itself out. But we 
may have eased it off a little. May- 
be we can save a few more victims. 
At least the stage is set for the 
next act.” 

“Was the last act to your satis- 
faction?” Wilson asked. His voice 
had an edge to it. 

“We’re not stage managers,” 
Youngman said. “We just hang 
around to pick up the pieces and 
try to keep the edges of the con-

HUE 

AND 

CRY 



Dear Editor: 

Many years ago I read a story 
based on or referring to the Epic of 
Gilgamesh. I would appreciate it if 
any of your readers could supply me 
with the name of the author and the 
book or story title. — Sophie Marks, 
1462 East 18th St., Brooklyn, N. Y. 
11230. 

• One that comes to mind is The 
Time Masters , a novel by Wilson 
Tucker. But there must have been 
others on this subject. Any sugges- 
tions from the readers? — Editor . 
* * * 

Dear Editor: • 

I do not agree with your idea of 
eliminating serials in If. The most 
popular stories in your magazine are 
the serials, and without them the 
sales will falter. Where would you 
be without The Moon Is a Harsh 
Mistress , Skylark DuQuesne , Earth- 
blood and others? People buy your 
magazine for the stories by big-name 
authors. Heinlein hasn’t written a 
short story in years. 

Please under no circumstances 
condense a novel in the manner of 
the Van Vogt piece coming up. A 
shortened version of a novel can 



thwart an author’s attempts at char- 
acterization, can destroy the theme 
or eliminate an important part and 
thus render the whole thing illogi- 
cal and incomprehensible to the 
reader. 

Wise old Horace Gold said in one 
of the very first issues of Galaxy 
that he would not review fanzines 
because “that is being covered suffi- 
ciently elsewhere.” Now it is being 
covered nowhere and I would like 
you to do this. Lin Carter seems to 
be the ideal person to be the re- 
viewer, so why don’t you ask him? 
It doesn’t have to be large; only a 
page or two of small print. 

Let’s have more Morrow, Peder- 
sen, McKenna and Chaffee covers. 
See if you can pry a story out of Ed 
Hamilton. Get Zelazny’s next novel. 
And avoid Harlan Ellison’s version 
of the new wave. — Darrell Schweit- 
zer, 113 Deepdale Rd., Stratford, 
Penna. 19087. 

• Part of Zelazny’s “next novel” 
is in this issue. And we have no in- 
tention of eliminating serials. When 
we get a good one, we’ll use it! It’s 
a funny thing; we get letters object- 
ing to serials until a serial is missing 



159 





— then everyone screams at us for 
not having one! As to f anzin e re- 
views, we feel the long lag between 
our receipt of the publications and 
the time the review could appear 
in print would make them useless; 
by the time the readers could see 
our comments, the magazine review- 
ed would be no longer obtainable. 
And the life and quality of most of 
such fan publications is too uncer- 
tain to make other than really cur- 
rent reviews fair to our readers. As 
to Ed Hamilton, we’re prying. — 
Editor . 

Dear Fred: 

A little experiment occurs to me, 
which you may or may not like to 
play with. I enclose three columns of 
numbers, whose nature and meaning 
would be obvious to any astronomer. 
If anyone can take these numbers 
and from them tell me the mass of 
the star system they refer to, I 
will be glad to listen to his opinions 
about the Velikovsky thesis. It is un- 
derstood, of course, that no refer- 
ences other than log and trig tables 
are to be used. If anyone who can- 
not do this presumes to support 
Velikovsky against the “establish- 
ment”, I will cheerfully cite him as 
an example of this “arrogance of 
ignorance” we hear so much about 
lately. 

It ought to be fun to read the 
excuses. To forestall the most ob- 
vious, this is not something fit only 
for Ph. D.’s. It is part of a first- 
year astronomy exercise in which I 
had no difficulty in getting an A — 
at a time when my math and physics 
grades were C and D respectively. It

not demand access to a high-class 
computer; most of my tenth-graders 
who have done it use the slide rule, 
but some prefer longhand arithmetic 
and still finish in a reasonable time. 
The observations are quite genuine, 
obtained from a published source, not 
cooked up for the purpose. 

As a schoolteacher, I know the 
near hopelessness of changing the 
mind of an adult; but maybe the 
excuses we get could be used to 
show my youngsters what they’ll be 
sounding like if they don’t develop 
reasonably high standards of think- 
ing. And maybe, of course, since my 
own mind is just as fossilized as that 
of most people my age, I’ll wind up 
looking silly myself. — Hal Clement, 
Milton, Mass.

Dear Editor: 

I would like to compliment you on 
the excellence of your magazine. 
Worlds of IF. No one can say sci- 
ence fiction is dying. On the con- 
trary, it is on its way up with IF 
setting new trends. 

Now to the point of my letter. 
Imagine for a moment the magazine 
Playboy. You change the girl on the 
centerfold to a space ship, the pic- 
torials to colored art work by Chaf- 
fee, Adkins or Morrow. Next you 
add stories out of IF , the now silent 
Worlds of Tomorrow , Galaxy, etc. 
What fan could pass up a magazine 
like that! Certainly a dollar would 
not be a price too high to pay. 

I would like to applaud Mrs. Mor- 
ris for her letter in the August IF. 
There is nothing more saddening and 
dangerous than a person who refuses 
to think for himself. Who knows, 



maybe if more people read science 
fiction, we’d have fewer wars. — 
Jurgen Heidenreich, 4220 146th Ave- 
nue S. E., Bellevue, Wash. 98004. 
• The only trouble with your idea 
for a magazine is that it would cost 
three dollars a copy to put out; and 
science-fiction magazines can’t get 
the advertising to make up the dif- 
ference, as more generalized maga- 
zines do. — Editor. 

* * * 

Dear Editor: 

With regard to Mr. Allen’s letter 
in October If, I totally disagree with 
him. To publish a story in each issue 
with “as little of the jargon of the 
medium as possible” would ruin the 
story completely. In my opinion, 
most science-fiction readers are of 
above-average intelligence and are 
not in need of explanations. There 
may be a technical term once in a 
great while with which the reader 
may not be familiar, but that can 
easily be looked up. It is very con- 
siderate of Mr. Allen to suggest that 
you provide these explanations — 
“especially for women.” But he re- 
ally need not worry. There are very 
few women who read SF, and those 
few, I am sure, are mostly young, 
college-educated women who have 
no trouble understanding SF, no 
matter how technical. (I started 
reading SF about five years ago and 
I have never had any trouble — 
even though English is not my moth- 
er tongue. As a matter of fact, 1 
have come to prefer it to any other 
type of fiction.) 

So much for that. I would like 
to refer to Mr. Neagle’s letter in the 
same issue, who would like a sword-

I am sure that most If readers will 
agree with me when I say that If 
should stick to “hard-core” SF. At 
present there are only three maga- 
zines available which publish SF ex- 
clusively; there are three magazines 
which publish a mixture of SF and 
fantasy as well as a fantasy-type

there should be no need to publish

* * * 

Dear Editor, 

The December 1968 issue of If 
was a goodie — I even liked the El- 
lison. 

It had one story of outstanding 
merit which I must commend. I do 
not know when I have read any story 
which so perfectly demonstrated the 
true function of science fiction — 
the logical projection of present day 
scientific trends into the future. In 
addition, this story very neatly point- 
ed up another function of sf which I 
I feel is important, although I have 
never seen it mentioned. This is the 
fact that human nature does not 
change — it hasn’t through the ages 
of history, and it won’t in the future. 
The story is, of course, Asimov’s 
“The Holmes-Ginsbook Device”. 
Add to this the delightful finishing 
touch. Gaughan’s illustration of The 
Compleat Scientist, which again sub- 
tly points out this second sf truth — 
that scientists in the future will be, 
basically, just like the scientists of 
today. Yeah.
