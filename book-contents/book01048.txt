A LOAD OFF THE MIND 



T O BE a writer, one has to 
have a rat’s-nest mind. You 
would be surprised at the amount 
of money I’ve made by knowing 
that the earliest use of vitamin 
therapy was the all-carrot diet 
(very popular in the Middle 
Ages), that oxy-acetylene torches 
burn under water, that although 
the Aztecs built a network of 
roads thousands of miles long, no 
form of the wheel was ever used 
in the New World before the 
white man came, and the like. 

But I still have numerous items 
that just would not fit into articles 
or fiction. 

For example, the lungrcancer 
scare hit Japan as hard as it did 
the rest of the world. The yen 
value dropped drastically . but 
worried researchers found that 
the total sales of cigarettes re- 
mained the same. Smokers, for 
some still undiscovered reason, 
had switched to cheaper brands. 
Did they figure that if they were 
going to get lung cancer, they 
might as well as get cheap ones? 
Another instance of ill logic 



was Dickens’ personal use of sta- 
tistics. He refused, one year, to 
travel because it was Christmas 
and the annual quota of death by 
railroad accident wasn’t filled. 

There were two disastrous fi- 
nancial ventures in China before 
WW II: 

Chrysler, whioh created the as- 
tonishingly ugly Airflow, sold 
none there — the Chinese regard 
the turtle as evil and said the 
Airflow looked like one. Darned 
if it didn’t. 

American insurance companies, 
introducing insurance to China 
for the first time, did a prodi- 
gious amount of business — until 
their buildings were stoned and 
burned. The beneficiaries were 
outraged because the insured had 
taken out life insurance and died 
just the same. 

Right after WW I, smart opera- 
tors sold millions of dollars’ worth 
of czarist rubles. A con, of course, 
because even if monarchy had 
been restored, the money would 
instantly have been repudiated.

H IS name was Liam 
O’Leary and there was 
something stinking in his 
nostrils. It was the smell of trou- 
ble. He hadn’t found what the 
trouble was yet, but he would. 
That was his business. He was a 
captain of guards in Estates-Gen- 
eral Correctional Institution — 
better known to its inmates as the 
Jug — and if he hadn’t been able 
to detect the scent of trouble 
brewing a cell-block away, he 
would never have survived to 
reach his captaincy. 

And her name, he saw, was 
Sue-Ann Bradley, Detainee No. 
WFA-656R. 

He frowned at the rap sheet, 
trying to figure out what got a 
girl like her into a place like this. 
And, what was more important, 
why she couldn’t adjust herself 
to it, now that she was in. 

He demanded: “Why wouldn’t 
you mop out your cell?” 

The girl lifted her head angrily 
and took a step forward. The 
block guard, Sodaro, growled 
wamingly: “Watch it, auntie!” 
O’Leary shook his head. “Let 
her talk, Sodaro.” It said in the 
Civil Service Guide to Prison Ad- 
ministration: “Detainees will be 
permitted to speak in their own 
behalf in disciplinary proceed- 
ings.” And O’Leary was a man 
who lived by the book.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Greensieeves 



By FREDER1K POHL 

This guard smelled trouble and it could be 
counted on to come— for a nose for trouble 
was one of the many talents bred here! 



MY LADY GREENSIEEVES 



7 



She burst out: “I never got a 
chance! That old witch Mathias 
never told me I was supposed to 
mop up. She banged on the door 
and said, ‘Slush up, sister!’ And 
then, ten minutes later, she called 
the guards and told them I re- 
fused to mop.” 

The block guard guffawed. 
“Wipe talk — that’s what she was 
telling you to do. Cap’n, you know 
what’s funny about this? This 
Bradley is—” 

“Shut up, Sodaro.” 

i" 1 APTAIN O’LEARY put down 
his pencil and looked at the 
girl. She was attractive and young 
— not beyond hope, surely. Maybe 
she had got off to a wrong start, 
but the question was, would put- 
ting her in the disciplinary block 
help straighten her out? He 
rubbed his ear and looked past 
her at the line of prisoners on 
the rap detail, waiting for him to 
judge their cases. 

He said patiently: “Bradley, 
the rules are you have to mop out 
your cell. If you didn’t understand 
what Mathias was talking about, 
you should have asked her. Now 
I’m warning you, the next time — ” 
“Hey, Cap’n, wait!” Sodaro was 
looking alarmed. “This isn’t a 
first offense. Look at the rap 
sheet. Yesterday she pulled the 
same thing in the mess hall.” He 
shook his head reprovingly at the 
prisoner. “The block guard had to 

8 



break up a fight between her and 
another wench, and she claimed 
the same business — said she 
didn’t understand when the other 
one asked her to move along.” He 
added virtuously: “The guard 
warned her then that next time 
she’d get the Greensleeves for 
sure.” 

Inmate Bradley seemed to be 
on the verge of tears. She said 
tautly: “I don’t care. I don’t care!” 

O’Leary stopped her. “That’s 
enough! Three days in Block O!” 

It was the only thing to do — 
for her own sake as much as for 
his. He had managed, by strength 
of will, not to hear that she had 
omitted to say “sir” every time she 
spoke to him, but he couldn’t 
keep it up forever and he cer- 
tainly couldn’t overlook hysteria. 
And hysteria was clearly the next 
step for her. 

All the same, he stared after 
her as she left. He handed the rap 
sheet to Sodaro and said ab- 
sently: “Too bad a kid like her 
has to be here. What’s she in 
for?” 

“You didn’t know, Cap’n?” So- 
daro leered. “She’s in for conspir- 
acy to violate the Categoried 
Class laws. Don’t waste your time 
with her, Cap’n. She’s a figger- 
lover!” 

Captain O’Leary took a long 
drink of water from the fountain 
marked “Civil Service.” But it 
didn’t wash the taste out of his 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



mouth, the smell from his nose. 

What got into a girl to get her 
mixed up with that kind of dirty 
business? He checked out of the 
cell blocks and walked across the 
yard, wondering about her. She’d 
had every advantage — decent 
Civil Service parents, a good edu- 
cation, everything a girl could 
wish for. If anything, she had had 
a better environment than 
O’Leary himself, and look what 
she had made of it. 

The direction of evolution is 
toward specialization and Man is 
no exception, but with the differ- 
ence that his is the one species 
that creates its own environment 
in which to specialize. From the 
moment that clans formed, spe- 
cialization began — the hunters us- 
ing the weapons made by the 
flint-chippers, the food cooked in 
clay pots made by the ceramists, 
over fire made by the shaman 
who guarded the sacred flame. 

Civilization merely increased 
the extent of specialization. From 
the born mechanic and the man 
with the gift of gab, society 
evolved to the point of smaller 
contact and less communication 
between the specializations, until 
now they could understand each 
other on only the most basic phys- 
ical necessities — and not even al- 
ways then. 

But this was desirable, for the 
more specialists, the higher the 
degree of civilization. The ulti- 

MY LADY GREENSLEEVES 



mate should be the complete seg- 
regation of each specialization — 
social and genetic measures to 
make them breed true, because 
the unspecialized man is an un- 
civilized man, or at any rate he 
does not advance civilization. And 
letting the specializations mix 
would produce genetic undesir- 
ables: clerk-laborer or Profes- 

sional-GI misfits, for example, be- 
ing only half specialized, would 
be good at no specialization. 

And the basis of this speciali- 
zation society was : “The aptitude 
groups are the true races of man- 
kind.” Putting it into law was 
only the legal enforcement of a 
demonstrable fact. 

“Evening, Cap’n.” A bleary old 
inmate orderly stood up straight 
and touched his cap as O’Leary 
passed by. 

“Evening.” 

O ’LEARY noted, with the part 
part of his mind that always 
noted those things, that the or- 
derly had been leaning on his 
broom until he’d noticed the cap- 
tain coming by. Of course, there 
wasn’t much to sweep — the spray 
machines and sweeperdozers had 
been over the cobblestones of the 
yard twice already that day. But 
it was an inmate’s job to keep 
busy. And it was a guard captain’s 
job to notice when they didn’t. 

There wasn’t anything wrong 
with that job, he told himself. It 

9 



was a perfectly good civil-service 
position — better than post-office 
clerk, not as good as Congress- 
man, but a job you could be 
proud to hold. He was proud of 
it. It was right that he should be 
proud of it. He was civil-service 
born and bred, and naturally he 
was proud and content to do a 
good, clean civil-service job. 

If he had happened to be bom 
a fig — a clerk, he corrected him- 
self— if he had happened to be 
born a clerk, why, he would have 
been proud of that, too. There 
wasn’t anything wrong with being 
a clerk — or a mechanic or a sol- 
dier, or even a laborer, for that 
matter. 

Good laborers were the salt of 
the Earth! They weren’t smart, 
maybe, but they had a — well, a 
sort of natural, relaxed joy of liv- 
ing. O’Leary was a broad-minded 
man and many times he had 
thought almost with a touch of 
envy how comfortable it must be 
to be a wipe — a laborer. No re- 
sponsibilities. No worries. Just an 
easy, slow routine of work and 
loaf, work and loaf. 

Of course, he wouldn’t really 
want that kind of life, because he 
was Civil Service and not the 
kind to try to cross over class 
barriers that weren’t meant to 
be — 

“Evening, Cap’n.” 

He nodded to the mechanic in- 
mate who was, theoretically, in 

10 



charge of maintaining the prison’s 
car pool, just inside the gate. 

“Evening, Conan,” he said. 

Conan, now— he was a big buck 
greaser and he would be there for 
the next hour, languidly poking a 
piece of fluff out of the air filter 
on the prison jeep. Lazy, sure. Un- 
dependable, certainly. But he 
kept the cars going— and, O’Leary 
thought approvingly, when his 
sentence was up in another year 
or so, he would go back to his 
life with his status restored, a 
mechanic on the outside as he had 
been inside, and he certainly 
would never risk coming back to 
the Jug by trying to pass as Civil 
Service or anything else. He knew 
his place. 

So why didn’t this girl, this 
Sue-Ann Bradley, know hers? 

II 

T? VERY prison has its Green- 
sleeves — sometimes they are 
called by different names. Old 
Marquette called it “the canary;” 
Louisiana State called it “the red 
hats;” elsewhere it was called “the 
hole,” “the snake pit,” “the Klon- 
dike.” When you’re in it, you 
don’t much care what it is called; 
it is a place for punishment. 

And punishment is what you 
get. 

Block O in Estates-General 
Correctional Institution was the 
disciplinary block, and because of 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the green straitjackets its inhabi- 
tants wore, it was called the 
Greensleeves. It was a commu- 
nity of its own, an enclave within 
the larger city-state that was the 
Jug. And like any other commu- 
nity, it had its leading citizens . 
two of them. Their names were 
Sauer and Flock. 

Sue-Ann Bradley heard them 
before she reached the Green- 
sleeves. She was in a detachment 
of three unfortunates like herself, 
convoyed by an irritable guard, 
climbing the steel steps toward 
Block O from the floor below, 
when she heard the yelling. 

“Owoo-o-o,” screamed Sauer 
from one end of the cell block 
and “Yow-w-w!” shrieked Flock at 
the other. 

The inside deck guard of Block 
O looked nervously at the outside 
deck guard. The outside guard 
looked impassively back — after 
all, he was on the outside. 

The inside guard muttered: 
“Wipe rats! They’re getting on 
my nerves.” 

The outside guard shrugged. 

“Detail, halt!” The two guards 
turned to see what was coming in 
as the three new candidates for 
the Greensleeves slumped to a 
stop at the head of the stairs. 
“Here they are,” Sodaro told 
them. “Take good care of ’em, 
will you? Especially the lady — 
she’s going to like it here, because 
there’s plenty of wipes and greas- 

MY LADY GREENSLEEVES 



ers and figgers to keep her com- 
pany.” He laughed coarsely and 
abandoned his charges to the 
Block O guards. 

The outside guard said sourly: 
“A woman, for God’s sake. Now 
O’Leary knows I hate it when 
there’s a woman in here. It gets 
the others all riled up.” 

“Let them in,” the inside guard 
told him. “The others are riled up 
already.” 

Sue-Ann Bradley looked care- 
fully at the floor and paid them 
no attention. The outside guard 
pulled the switch that turned on 
the tanglefoot electronic fields 
that swamped the floor of the 
block corridor and of each indi- 
vidual cell. While the fields were 
on, you could ignore the prisoners 
— they simply could not move fast 
enough, against the electronic 
drag of the field, to do any harm. 
But it was a rule that, even in 
Block O, you didn’t leave the 
tangler fields on all the time — 
only when the cell doors had to 
be opened or a prisoner’s restrain- 
ing garment removed. 

Sue-Ann walked bravely for- 
ward through the opened gate — 
and fell flat on her face. It was 
her first experience of a tangle- 
foot field. It was like walking 
through molasses. 

The guard guffawed and lifted 
her up by one shoulder. “Take it 
easy, auntie. Come on, get in your 
cell.” He steered her in the right 

11 



direction and pointed to a green- 
sleeved strait jacket on the cell 
cot. “Put that on. Being as you’re 
a lady, we won’t tie it up, but the 
rules say you got to wear it and 
the rules— Hey. She’s crying!” 
He shook his head, marveling. It 
was the first time he had ever 
seen a prisoner cry in the Green- 
sleeves. 

However, he was wrong. Sue- 
Ann’s shoulders were shaking, but 
not from tears. Sue-Ann Bradley 
had got a good look at Sauer and 
at Flock as she passed them by 
and she was fighting off an almost 
uncontrollable urge to retch. 

QAUER and Flock were what 
^ are called prison wolves. 
They were laborers — “wipes,” for 
short — or, at any rate, they had 
been once. They had spent so 
much time in prisons that it was 
sometimes hard even for them to 
remember what they really were, 
outside. Sauer was a big, grinning 
redhead with eyes like a water 
moccasin. Flock was a lithe five- 
footer with the build of a water 
moccasin — and the sad, stupid 
eyes of a calf. 

Sauer stopped yelling for a mo- 
ment. “Hey, Flock!” 

“What do you want, Sauer?” 
called Flock from his own cell. 

“We got a lady with us! Maybe 
we ought to cut out this yelling so 
as not to disturb the lady!” He 
screeched with howling, maniacal 



laughter. “Anyway, if we don’t cut 
this out, they’ll get us in trouble, 
Flock!” 

“Oh, you think so?” shrieked 
Flock. “Jeez, I wish you hadn’t 
said that, Sauer. You got me 
scared! I’m so scared, I’m gonna 
have to yell!” 

The howling started all over 
again. 

The inside guard finished put- 
ting the new prisoners away and 
turned off the tangler field once 
more. He licked his lips. “Say, you 
want to take a turn in here for a 
while?” 

“Uh-uh.” The outside guard 
shook his head. 

“You’re yellow,” the inside 
guard said moodily. “Ah, I don’t 
know why I don’t quit this lousy 
job. Hey, you! Pipe down or I’ll 
come in and beat your head off!” 

“Ee-ee-ee!” screamed Sauer in 
a shrill falsetto. “I’m scared!” 
Then he grinned at the guard, all 
but his water - moccasin eyes. 
“Don’t you know you can’t hurt 
a wipe by hitting him on the head, 
Boss?” 

“Shut up/” yelled the inside 
guard. 

Sue-Ann Bradley’s weeping 
now was genuine. She simply 
could not help it. The crazy yowl- 
ing of the hard-timers, Sauer and 
Flock, was getting under her skin. 
They weren’t even — even human, 
she told herself miserably, trying 
to weep silently so as not to give 



12 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the guards the satisfaction of 
hearing her — they were animals! 

Resentment and anger, she 
could understand. She told herself 
doggedly that resentment and 
anger were natural and right. 
They were perfectly normal ex- 
pressions of the freedom-loving 
citizen’s rebellion against the vile 
and stifling system of Categoried 
Classes. It was good that Sauer 
and Flock still had enough spirit 
to struggle against the vicious 
system — 

But did they have to scream 
so? 

The senseless yelling was driv- 
ing her crazy. She abandoned 
herself to weeping and she didn’t 
even care who heard her any 
more. Senseless! 

It never occurred to Sue-Ann 
Bradley that it might not be 
senseless, because noise hides 
noise. But then she hadn’t been 
a prisoner very long. 

Ill 

SMELL trouble,” said 

-*■ O’Leary to the warden. 

“Trouble? Trouble?” Warden 
Schluckebier clutched his throat 
and his little round eyes looked 
terrified — as perhaps they should 
have. Warden Godfrey Schlucke- 
bier was the almighty Caesar of 
ten thousand inmates in the Jug, 
but privately he was a fussy old 
man trying to hold onto the last 



decent job he would have in his 
life. 

“Trouble? What trouble?” 

O’Leary shrugged. “Different 
things. You know Lafon, from 
Block A? This afternoon, he was 
playing ball with the laundry or- 
derlies in the yard.” 

The warden, faintly relieved, 
faintly annoyed, scolded: 
“O’Leary, what did you want to 
worry me for? There’s nothing 
wrong with playing ball in the 
yard. That’s what recreation peri- 
ods are for.” 

“You don’t see what I mean, 
Warden. Lafgn was a professional 
on the outside — an architect. 
Those laundry cons were laborers. 
Pros and wipes don’t mix; it isn’t 
natural. And there are other 
things.” 

O’Leary hesitated, frowning. 
How could you explain to the 
warden that it didn’t smell right? 

“For instance— Well, there’s 
Aunt Mathias in the women’s 
block. She’s a pretty good old girl 
— that’s why she’s the block or- 
derly. She’s a lifer, she’s got no 
place to go, she gets along with 
the other women. But today she 
put a woman named Bradley on 
report. Why? Because she told 
Bradley to mop up in wipe talk 
and Bradley didn’t understand. 
Now Mathias wouldn’t—” 

The warden raised his hand. 
“Please, O’Leary, don’t bother me 
about that kind of stuff.” He 



MY LADY GREENSLEEVES 



13 



sighed heavily and rubbed his 
eyes. He poured himself a cup of 
steaming black coffee from a 
brewpot, reached in a desk 
drawer for something, hesitated, 
glanced at O’Leary, then dropped 
a pale blue tablet into the cup. 
He drank it down eagerly, ignor- 
ing the scalding heat. 

He leaned back, looking sud- 
denly happier and much more as- 
sured. 

“O’Leary, you’re a guard cap- 
tain, right? And I’m your warden. 
You have your job, keeping the 
inmates in line, and I have mine. 
Now your job is just as important 
as my job,” he said piously. 
“Everybody’s job is just as impor- 
tant as everybody else’s, right? 
But we have to stick to our own 
jobs. We don’t want to try to 
pass.” 

O’Leary snapped erect, abrupt- 
ly angry. Pass! What the devil 
way was that for the warden to 
talk to him? 

“Excuse the expression, 
O’Leary,” the warden said anx- 
iously. “I mean, after all, ‘Spe- 
cialization is the goal of civiliza- 
tion,’ right?” He was a great 
man for platitudes, was Warden 
Schluckebier. “You know you 
don’t want to worry about my 
end of running the prison. And I 
don’t want to worry about yours. 
You see?” And he folded his 
hands and smiled like a civil- 
service Buddha.

O ’LEARY choked back his 
temper. “Warden, I’m telling 
you that there’s trouble coming 
up. I smell the signs.” 

“Handle it, then!” snapped the 
warden, irritated at last. 

“But suppose it’s too big to 
handle. Suppose — ” 

“It isn’t,” the warden said posi- 
tively. “Don’t borrow trouble with 
all your supposing, O’Leary.” He 
sipped the remains of his coffee, 
made a wry face, poured a fresh 
cup and, with an elaborate show 
of not noticing what he was doing, 
dropped three of the pale blue 
tablets into it this time. 

He sat beaming into space, 
waiting for the jolt to take effect. 

“Well, then,” he said at last. 
“You just remember what I’ve 
told you tonight, O’Leary, and 
we’ll get along fine. ‘Specializa- 
tion is the — ’ Oh, curse the thing.” 
His phone was ringing. The 
warden picked it up irritably. 

That was the trouble with 
those pale blue tablets, thought 
O’Leary; they gave you a lift, but 
they put you on edge. 

“Hello,” barked the warden, not 
even glancing at the viewscreen. 
“What the devil do you want? 
Don’t you know I’m — What? 
You did what? You’re going to 
WHAT?” 

He looked at the viewscreen at 
last with a look of pure horror. 
Whatever he saw on it, it did not 
reassure him. His eyes opened 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



like clamshells in a steamer. 

“O’Leary,” he said faintly, “my 
mistake.” 

And he hung up — more or less 
by accident; the handset dropped 
from his fingers. 

The person on the other end of 
the phone was calling from Cell 
Block O. 

Five minutes before, he hadn’t 
been anywhere near the phone 
and it didn’t look as if his chances 
of ever getting near it were very 
good. Because five minutes be- 
fore, he was in his cell, with the 
rest of the hard-timers of the 
Greensleeves. 

His name was Flock. 

He was still yelling. Sue-Ann 
Bradley, in the cell across from 
him, thought that maybe, after 
all, the man was really in pain. 
Maybe the crazy screams were 
screams of agony, because cer- 
tainly his face was the face of an 
agonized man. 

The outside guard bellowed: 
“Okay, okay. Take ten!” 

Sue-Ann froze, waiting to see 
what would happen. What actu- 
ally did happen was that the 
guard reached up and closed the 
switch that actuated the tangler 
fields on the floors of the cells. 
The prison rules were humani- 
tarian, even for the dregs that 
inhabited the Greensleeves. Ten 
minutes out of every two hours, 
even the worst case had to be al- 
lowed to take his hands out of 

MY LADY GREENSLEEVES 



the restraining garment. 

“Rest period” it was called- 
in the rule book. The inmates had 
a less lovely term for it. 

A T THE guard’s yell, the in- 
mates jumped to their feet. 

Bradley was a little slow get- 
ting off the edge of the steel-slat 
bed — nobody had warned her 
that the eddy currents in the 
tangler fields had a way of mak- 
ing metal smoke-hot. She gasped 
but didn’t cry out. Score one more 
painful lesson in her new lan- 
guage course. She rubbed the 
backs of her thighs gingerly — 
and slowly, slowly, for the eddy 
currents did not permit you to 
move fast. It was like pushing 
against rubber; the faster you 
tried to move, the greater the re- 
sistance. 

The guard peered genially into 
her cell. “You’re okay, auntie.” 
She proudly ignored him as he 
slogged deliberately away on his 
rounds. He didn’t have to untie 
her and practically stand over her 
while she attended to various per- 
sonal matters, as he did with the 
male prisoners. It was not much 
to be grateful for, but Sue-Ann 
Bradley was grateful. At least she 
didn’t have to live quite like a fig 
— like an underprivileged clerk, 
she told herself, conscience- 
stricken. 

Across the hall, the guard was 
saying irritably: “What the hell's 

is 



the matter with you?” He opened 
the door of the cell with an asbes- 
tos-handled key held in a canvas 
glove. 

Flock was in that cell and he 
was doubled over. 

The guard looked at him doubt- 
fully. It could be a trick, maybe. 
Couldn’t it? But he could see 
Flock’s face and the agony in it 
was real enough. And Flock was 
gasping, through real tears: 
“Cramps. I-I-” 

“Ah, you wipes always got a 
pain in the gut.” The guard lum- 
bered around Flock to the draw- 
strings at the back of the jacket. 
Funny smell in here, he told him- 
self— not for the first time. And 
imagine, some people didn’t be- 
lieve that wipes had a smell of 
their own! But this time, he real- 
ized cloudily, it was a rather un- 
usual smell. Something burning. 
Almost like meat scorching. 

It wasn’t pleasant. He finished 
untying Flock and turned away; 
let the stinking wipe take care of 
his own troubles. He only had ten 
minutes to get all the way around 
Block O and the inmates com- 
plained like crazy if he didn’t 
make sure they all got the most 
possible free time. He was pretty 
good at snowshoeing through the 
tangler field. He was a little vain 
about it, even; at times he had 
been known to boast of his ability 
to make the rounds in two min- 
utes, every time. 



Every time but this. 

For Flock moaned behind him, 
oddly close. 

The guard turned, but not 
quickly enough. There was Flock 
— astonishingly, he was half out 
of his jacket; his arms hadn’t been 
in the sleeves at all! And in one 
of the hands, incredibly, there was 
something that glinted and 
smoked. 

“All right,” croaked Flock, tears 
trickling out of eyes nearly shut 
with pain. 

But it wasn’t the tears that held 
the guard; it was the shining, 
smoking thing, now poised at his 
throat. A shiv! It looked as though 
it had been made out of a bed- 
spring, ripped loose from its 
frame God knows how, hidden in- 
side the green-sleeved jacket God 
knows how — filed, filed to sharp- 
ness over endless hours. 

No wonder Flock moaned — the 
eddy currents in the shiv were 
slowly cooking his hand; and the 
blister against his abdomen, 
where the shiv had been hidden 
during other rest periods, felt like 
raw acid. 

“All right,” whispered Flock, 
“just walk out the door and you 
won’t get hurt. Unless the other 
screw makes trouble, you won’t 
get hurt, so tell him not to, you 
hear?” 

He was nearly fainting with 
the pain. 

But he hadn’t let go. 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He didn’t let go. And he didn’t 
stop. 

IV 

I T WAS Flock on the phone to 
the warden — Flock with his 
eyes still streaming tears, Flock 
with Sauer standing right behind 
him, menacing the two bound 
deck guards. 

Sauer shoved Flock out of the 
way. “Hey, Warden!” he said, and 
the voice was a cheerful bray, 
though the serpent eyes were cold 
and hating. “Warden, you got to 
get a medic in here. My boy 
Flock, he hurt himself real bad 
and he needs a doctor.” He ges- 
tured playfully at the guards with 
the shiv. “I tell you, Warden. I 
got this knife and I got your 
guards here. Enough said? So get 
a medic in here quick, you hear?” 
And he snapped the connection. 
O’Leary said: “Warden, I told 
you I smelled trouble!” 

The warden lifted his head, 
glared, started feebly to speak, 
hesitated, and picked up the long- 
distance phone. He said sadly to 
the prison operator: “Get me the 
governor — fast.” 

Riot! 

The word spread out from the 
prison on seven-league boots. 

It snatched the city governor 
out of a friendly game of Senior- 
ity with his manager and their 
wives — and just when he was 

MY LADY GREENSLEEVES 



holding the Porkbarrel Joker con- 
cealed in the hole. 

It broke up the Base Cham- 
pionship Scramble Finals at Hap 
Arnold Field to the south, as half 
the contestants had to scramble 
in earnest to a Red Alert that was 
real. 

It reached to police precinct 
houses and TV newsrooms and 
highway checkpoints, and from 
there it filtered into the homes 
and lives of the nineteen million 
persons that lived within a few 
dozen miles of the Jug. 

Riot. And yet fewer than half 
a dozen men were involved. 

A handful of men, and the 
enormous bulk of the city-state 
quivered in every limb and class. 
In its ten million homes, in its 
hundreds of thousands of public 
places, the city-state’s people 
shook under the impact of the 
news from the prison. 

For the news touched them 
where their fears lay. Riot! And 
not merely a street brawl among 
roistering wipes, or a bar-room 
fight of greasers relaxing from a 
hard day at the plant. The riot 
was down among the corrupt 
sludge that underlay the state it- 
self. Wipes brawled with wipes 
and no one cared; but in the Jug, 
all classes were cast together. 

t 1 ORTY miles to the south, 
Hap Arnold Field was a 
blaze of light. The airmen tum- 

17 



bled out of their quarters and 
dayrooms at the screech of the 
alert siren, and behind them their 
wives and children stretched and 
yawned and worried. An alert! 
The older kids fussed and com- 
plained and their mothers shut 
them up. No, there wasn’t any 
alert scheduled for tonight; no, 
they didn’t know where Daddy 
was going; no, the kids couldn’t 
get up yet — it was the middle of 
the night. 

And as soon as they had the 
kids back in bed, most of the 
mothers struggled into their own 
airwac uniforms and headed for 
the briefing area to hear. 

They caught the words from a 
distance — not quite correctly. 
“Riot!” gasped an aircraftswoman 
first-class, mother of three. “The 
wipes! I told Charlie they’d get 
out of hand and — Alys, we aren’t 
safe. You know how they are 
about GI women! I’m going right 
home and get a club and stand 
right by the door and—” 

“Club!” snapped Alys, radar- 
scope-sergeant, with two children 
querulously awake in her nursery 
at home. “What in God’s name is 
the use of a club? You can’t hurt 
a wipe by hitting him on the 
head. You’d better come along to 
Supply with me and draw a gun 
— you’ll need it before this night 
is over.” 

But the airmen themselves 
heard the briefing loud and clear 



over the scramble-call speakers, 
and they knew it was not merely 
a matter of trouble in the wipe 
quarters. The Jug! The governor 
himself had called them out; they 
were to fly interdicting missions 
at such-and-such levels on such- 
and-such flight circuits around the 
prison. 

The rockets took off on foun- 
tains of fire; and the jets took off 
with a whistling roar; and last of 
all, the helicopters took off . 
and they were the ones who 
might actually accomplish some- 
thing. They took up their picket 
posts on the prison perimeter, a 
pilot and two bombardiers in each 
’copter, stone-faced, staring grimly 
alert at the prison below. 

They were ready for the break- 
out. 

But there wasn’t any breakout. 

The rockets went home for 
fuel. The jets went home for fuel. 
The helicopters hung on — still 
ready, still waiting. 

The rockets came back and 
roared harmlessly about, and 
went away again. They stayed 
away. The helicopter men never 
faltered and never relaxed. The 
prison below them was washed 
with light — from the guard posts 
on the walls, from the cell blocks 
themselves, from the mobile 
lights of the guard squadrons sur- 
rounding the walls. 

North of the prison, on the 
long, flat, damp developments of 



IB 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



reclaimed land, the matchbox row 
houses of the clerical neighbor- 
hoods showed lights in every win- 
dow as the figgers stood ready to 
repel invasion from their unde- 
sired neighbors to the east, the 
wipes. In the crowded tenements 
of the laborers’ quarters, the 
wipes shouted from window to 
window; and there were crowds 
in the bright streets. 

“The whole bloody thing’s go- 
ing to blow up!” a helicopter 
bombardier yelled bitterly to his 
pilot, above the flutter and roar 
of the whirling blades. “Look at 
the mobs in Greaserville! The 
first breakout from the Jug’s go- 
ing to start a fight like you never 
saw and we’ll be right in the mid- 
dle of it!” 

He was partly right. He would 
be right in the middle of it — for 
every man, woman and child in 
the city-state would be right in 
the middle of it. There was no 
place anywhere that would be 
spared. No mixing. That was the 
prescription that kept the city- 
state alive. There’s no harm in a 
family fight — and aren’t all me- 
chanics a family, aren’t all labor- 
ers a clan, aren’t all clerks and 
office workers related by closer 
ties than blood or skin? 

But the declassed cons of the 
Jug were the dregs of every class; 
and once they spread, the neat 
compartmentation of society was 
pierced. The breakout would 

MY LADY GREENSLEEVES 



mean riot on a bigger scale than 
any prison had ever known. 

But he was also partly wrong. 
Because the breakout wasn’t 
seeming to come. 

r T , HE Jug itself was coming to 
■*- a boil. 

Honor Block A, relaxed and 
easy at the end of another day, 
found itself shaken alert by 
strange goings-on. First there was 
the whir and roar of the Air Force 
overhead. T rouble. Then there 
was the sudden arrival of extra 
guards, doubling the normal com- 
plement — day-shift guards, sum- 
moned away from their comfort- 
able civil-service homes at some 
urgent call. Trouble lor sure. 

Honor Block A wasn’t used to 
trouble. A Block was as far from 
the Greensleeves of O Block as 
you could get and still be in the 
Jug. Honor Block A belonged to 
the prison’s halfbreeds — the honor 
prisoners, the trusties who did 
guards’ work because there 
weren’t enough guards to go 
around. They weren’t Apaches or 
Piutes; they were camp-following 
Injuns who had sold out for the 
white man’s firewater. The price 
of their service was privilege — 
many privileges. 

Item: TV sets in every cell. 
Item : Hobby tools, to make gadg-

an exact knowledge of everything 
the outside world knew and put 
on its TV screens (including the 
grim, alarming reports of “trouble 
at Estates-General”), and the ca- 
pacity to convert their “hobby 
tools” to — other uses. 

An honor prisoner named Wil- 
mer Lafon was watching the TV 
screen with an expression of rage 
and despair. 

Lafon was a credit to the Jug 

— he was a showpiece for visitors. 
Prison rules provided for prisoner 
training — it was a matter of “re- 
habilitation.” Prisoner rehabilita- 
tion is a joke and a centuries-old 
one at that; but it had its serious 
uses, and one of them was to keep 
the prisoners busy. It didn’t much 
matter at what. 

Lafon, for instance, was being 
“rehabilitated” by studying archi- 
tecture. The guards made a point 
of bringing inspection delegations 
to his cell to show him off. There 
were his walls, covered with pin- 
ups — but not of women. The pic- 
tures were sketches Lafon had 
drawn himself; they were of 
buildings, highways, dams and 
bridges; they were splendidly con- 
ceived and immaculately exe- 
cuted. 

“Looka that!” the guards would 
rumble to their guests. “There 
isn’t an architect on the outside as 
good as this boy! What do you 
say, Wilmer? Tell the gentlemen 

— how long you been taking these 




20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




correspondence courses in archi- 
tecture? Six years! Ever since he 
came to the Jug.” 

And Lafon would grin and bob 
his head, and the delegation 
would go, with the guards saying 
something like: “Believe me, that 
Wilmer could design a whole sky- 
scraper— and it wouldn’t fall 
down, either!” 

And they were perfectly, prov- 
ably right. Not only could Inmate 
Lafon design a skyscraper, but 
he had already done so. More 
than a dozen of them. And none 
had fallen down. 

Of course, that was more than 
six years back, before he was con- 
victed and sent to the Jug. He 
would never design another. Or if 
he did, it would never be built. 
For the plain fact of the matter 
was that the Jug’s rehabilitation 
courses were like rehabilitation in 
every prison since crime and pun- 
ishment began. They kept the in- 
mates busy. They made a show 
of purpose for an institution that 
had never had a purpose beyond 
punishment. 

And that was all. 

For punishment for a crime is 
not satisfied by a jail sentence. 
How does it hurt a man to feed 
and clothe and house him, with 
the bills paid by the state? La- 
fon’s punishment was that he, as 
an architect, was through. 

Savage tribes used to lop off a 
finger or an ear to punish a crim- 



MY LADY GREENSLEEVES ‘

inal. Civilized societies confine 
their amputations to bits and 
pieces of the personality. Chop- 
chop, and a man’s reputation 
comes off; chop-chop again, and 
his professional standing is gone; 
chop-chop, and he has lost the re- 
spect and trust of his fellows. 

The jail itself isn’t the punish- 
ment. The jail is only the sha- 
man’s hatchet that performs the 
amputation. If rehabilitation in a 
jail worked — if it were meant to 
work — it would be the end of 
jails. 

Rehabilitation? Rehabilitation 
for what? 

W7TLMER LAFON switched 
” off the television set and si- 
lently pounded his fist into the 
wall. 

Never again to return to the 
Professional class! For, naturally, 
the conviction had cost him his 
membership in the Architectural 
Society and that had cost him his 
Professional standing. 

But still — just to be out of the 
Jug, that would be something! 
And his whole hope of ever get- 
ting out lay not here in Honor 
Block A, but in the turmoil of the 
Greensleeves, a hundred meters 
and more than fifty armed guards 
away. 

He was a furious man. He 
looked into the cell next door, 
where a con named Garcia was 
trying to concentrate on a game 



of Solitaire Splitfee. Once Garcia 
had been a Professional, too; he 
was the closest thing to a friend 
Wilmer Lafon had. Maybe he 
could now help to get Lafon 
where he wanted — needed! — to 
be. 

Lafon swore silently and shook 
his head. Garcia was a spineless 
milksop, as bad as any clerk — 
Lafon was nearly sure there was 
a touch of the inkwell somewhere 
in his family. Shrewd and slip- 
pery enough, like all figgers. But 
you couldn’t rely on him in a 
pinch. 

Lafon would have to do it all 
himself. 

He thought for a second, ignor- 
ing the rustle and mumble of the 
other honor prisoners of Block A. 
There was no help for it; he 
would have to dirty his hands 
with physical activity. 

Outside on the deck, the guards 
were grumbling to each other. 
Lafon wiped the scowl off his 
black face, put on a smile, re- 
hearsed what he was going to say, 
and politely rattled the door of 
his cell. 

“Shut up down there!” one of 
the screws bawled. Lafon recog- 
nized the voice; it was the guard 
named Sodaro. That was all to 
the good. He knew Sodaro and he 
had some plans for him. 

He rattled the cell door again 
and called: “Chief, can you come 
here a minute, please?” 



12 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Sodaro yelled: “Didn't you 
hear me? Shut up!” But he came 
wandering by and looked into 
Lafon’s tidy little cell. 

“What the devil do you want?” 
he growled. 

Lafon said ingratiatingly: 
“What’s going on, Chief?” 

“Shut your mouth,” Sodaro said 
absently and yawned. He hefted 
his shoulder holster comfortably. 
That O’Leary, what a production 
he had made of getting the guards 
back! And here he was, stuck in 
Block A on the night he had set 
aside for getting better acquainted 
with that little blue-eyed statis- 
tician from the Census office. 

“Aw, Chief. The television says 
there’s something going on in the 
Greensleeves. What’s the score?” 

Sodaro had no reason not to 
answer him, but it was his un- 
varying practice to make a con 
wait before doing anything the 
con wanted. He gave Lafon a 
ten-second stare before he re- 
lented. 

‘The score? Sauer and Flock 
took over Block O. What about 
it?” 

Much, much about it! But La- 
fon looked away to hide the ea- 
gerness in his eyes. Perhaps, after 
all, it was not too late. 

He suggested humbly: “You 
look a little sleepy. Do you want 
some coffee?” 

“Coffee?” Sodaro scratched. 
“You got a cup for me?” 



“Certainly! I’ve got one put 
aside — swiped it from the mess- 
hall— not the one I use myself.” 

“Um.” Sodaro leaned on the 
cell door. “You know I could toss 
you in the Greensleeves for steal- 
ing from the messhall.” 

44 A W, CHIEF!” Lafon grinned. 

“You been looking for 
trouble. O’Leary says you were 
messing around with the bucks 
from the laundry detail,” Sodaro 
said halfheartedly. But he didn’t 
really like picking on Lafon, who 
was, after all, an agreeable inmate 
to have on occasion. “All right. 
Where’s the coffee?” 

They didn’t bother with tangle- 
foot fields in Honor Block A. So- 
daro just unlocked the door and 
walked in, hardly bothering to 
look at Lafon. He took three steps 
toward the neat little desk at the 
back of the cell, where Lafon had 
rigged up a drawing board and a 
table, where Lafon kept his little 
store of luxury goods. 

Three steps. 

And then, suddenly aware that 
Lafon was very close to him, he 
turned, astonished — a little too 
late. He saw that Lafon had 
snatched up a metal chair; he 
saw Lafon swinging it, his black 
face maniacal; he saw the chair 
coming down. 

He reached for his shoulder 
holster, but it was very much too 
late for that.

V 

APT AIN O’LEARY dragged 
^ the scared little wretch into 
the warden’s office. He shook the 
con angrily. “Listen to this, War- 
den! The boys just brought this 
one in from the Shops Building. 
Do you know what he’s been up 
to?” 

The warden wheezed sadly and 
looked away. He had stopped 
even answering O’Leary by now. 
He had stopped talking to Sauer 
on the interphone when the big 
convict called, every few minutes, 
to rave and threaten and demand 
a doctor. He had almost stopped 
doing everything except worry and 
weep. But — still and all, he was 
the warden. He was the one who 
gave the orders. 

O’Leary barked: “Warden, this 
little greaser has bollixed up the 
whole tangler circuit for the 
prison. If the cons get out into 
the yard now, you won’t be able 
to tangle them. You know what 
that means? They’ll have the 
freedom of the yard, and who 
knows what comes next?” 

The warden frowned sympa- 
thetically. “Tsk, tsk.” 

O’Leary shook the con again. 
“Come on, Hiroko! Tell the war- 
den what you told the guards.” 
The con shrank away from 
him. Sweat was glistening on his 
furrowed yellow forehead. “I — I 
had to do it, Cap’n! I shorted the 



wormcan in the tangler subgrid, 
but I had to! I got a signal — 
‘Bollix the grid tonight or some 
day you’ll be in the yard and 
we’ll static you!’ What could I do, 
Cap’n? I didn’t want to—” 

O’Leary pressed: “Who did the 
signal come from?” 

The con only shook his head, 
perspiring still more. 

The warden asked faintly: 
“What’s he saying?” 

O’Leary rolled his eyes to 
heaven. And this was the warden 

— couldn’t even understand shop- 
talk from the mouths of his own 
inmates! 

He translated: “He got orders 
from the prison underground to 
short-circuit the electronic units 
in the tangler circuit. They threat- 
ened to kill him if he didn’t.” 
The warden drummed with his 
fingers on the desk. 

“The tangler field, eh? My, yes. 
That is important. You’d better 
get it fixed, O’Leary. Right away.” 
“Fixed? Warden, who’s going 
to fix it? You know as well as I 
do that every mechanic in the 
prison is a con. Even if one of 
the guards would do a thing like 
that — and I’d bust him myself if 
he did! — he wouldn’t know where 
to start. That’s mechanic work.” 
The warden swallowed. He had 
to admit that O’Leary was right. 
Naturally nobody but a mechanic 

— and a specialist electrician from 
a particular subgroup of the 



24 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



greaser class at that — could fix 
something like the tangler field 
generators. 

He said absently: “Well, that’s 
true enough. After all, ‘Speciali- 
zation is the goal of civilization,’ 
you know.” 

O’Leary took a deep breath. He 
needed it. 

He beckoned to the guard at 
the door. “Take this greaser out 
of here!” 

The con shambled out, his head 
hanging. 

/''V ’LEARY turned to the war- 
den and spread his hands. 

“Warden,” he said, “don’t you 
see how this thing is building up? 
Let’s not just wait for the place 
to explode in our faces! Let me 
take a squad info Block O before 
it’s too late.” 

The warden pursed his lips 
thoughtfully and cocked his head, 
as though he were trying to find 
some trace of merit in an unrea- 
sonable request. 

He said at last: “No.” 

O’Leary made a passionate 
sound that was trying to be bad 
language, but he was too raging 
mad to articulate it. He walked 
stiffly away from the limp, silent 
warden and stared out the win- 
dow. 

At least, he told himself, he 
hadn’t gone to pieces. It was his 
doing, not the warden’s, that all 
the off-duty guards had been 

MY LADY GREENSLEEVES 



dragged double-time back to the 
prison, his doing that they were 
now ringed around the outer walls 
or scattered on extra-man patrols 
throughout the prison. 

It was something, but O’Leary 
couldn’t believe that it was 
enough. He’d been in touch with 
half a dozen of the details inside 
the prison on the intercom and 
each of them had reported the 
same thing. In all of E-G, not a 
single prisoner was asleep. They 
were talking back and forth be- 
tween the cells and the guards 
couldn’t shut them up. They were 
listening to concealed radios and 
the guards didn’t dare make a 
shakedown to find them. They 
were working themselves up to 
something. To what? 

O’Leary didn’t want ever to 
find out what. He wanted to go in 
there with a couple of the best 
guards he could get his hands on 
— shoot his way into the Green- 
sleeves if he had to — and clean 
out the infection. 

But the warden said no. 

O’Leary stared balefully at the 
hovering helicopters. 

The warden was the warden. 
He was placed in that position 
through the meticulously careful 
operations of the Civil Service 
machinery, maintained in that po- 
sition year after year through the 
penetrating annual inquiries of 
the Reclassification Board. It was 
subversive to think that the 

25 



Board could have made a mis- 
take! 

But O’Leary was absolutely 
sure that the warden was a 
scared, ineffectual jerk. 

HP HE interphone was ringing 
again. The warden picked up 
the handpiece and held it bone- 
lessly at arm’s length, his eyes 
fixed glassily on the wall. It was 
Sauer from the Greensleeves 
again. O’Leary could hear his 
maddened bray. 

“I warned you, Warden!” 
O’Leary could see the big con’s 
contorted face in miniature, in 
the view screen of the interphone. 
The grin was broad and jolly, the 
snake’s eyes poisonously cold. 
“I’m going to give you five min- 
utes, Warden, you hear? Five 
minutes! And if there isn’t a 
medic in here in five minutes to 
take care of my boy Flock — your 
guards have had it! I’m going to 
slice off an ear and throw it out 
the window, you hear me? And 
five minutes later, another ear. 
And five minutes later—” 

The warden groaned weakly. 
“I’ve called for the prison medic, 
Sauer. Honestly I have! I’m sure 
he’s coming as rapidly as he — ” 

“Five minutes!” And the fero- 
ciously grinning face disappeared. 

O’Leary leaned forward. “War- 
den, let me take a squad in 
there!” 

The warden gazed at him for 



a blank moment. “Squad? No, 
O’Leary. What’s the use of a 
squad? It’s a medic I have to get 
in there. I have a responsibility 
to those guards and if I don’t get 
a medic—” 

A cold, calm voice from the 
door: “I am here, Warden.” 
O’Leary and the warden both 
jumped up. 

The medic nodded slightly. 
“You may sit down.” 

“Oh, Doctor! Thank heaven 
you’re here!” The warden was 
falling all over himself, getting a 
chair for his guest, flustering 
about. 

O’Leary said sharply: “Wait a 
minute, Warden. You can’t let the 
doctor go in alone!” 

“He isn’t alone!” The doctor’s 
intern came from behind him, 
scowling belligerently at O’Leary. 
Youngish, his beard pale and 
silky, he was a long way from his 
first practice. “I’m here to assist 
him!” 

O’Leary put a strain on his pa- 
tience. “They’ll eat you up in 
there, Doc! Those are the worst 
cons in the prison. They’ve got 
two hostages already. What’s the 
use of giving them two more?” 
The medic fixed him with his 
eyes. He was a tall man and he 
wore his beard proudly. “Guard, 
do you think you can prevent me 
from healing a sufferer?” He 
folded his hands over his abdo- 
men and turned to leave.

The intern stepped aside and 
bowed his head. 

O’Leary surrendered. “All right, 
you can go. But I’m coming with 
you — with a squad!” 

TNMATE Sue-Ann Bradley cow- 
ered in her cell. The Green- 
sleeves was jumping. She had 
never— no, never, she told herself 
wretchedly — thought that it 
would be anything like this. She 
listened unbelievingly to the 
noise the released prisoners were 
making, smashing the chairs and 
commodes in their cells, scream- 
ing threats at the bound guards. 

She faced the thought with 
fear, and with the sorrow of a 
murdered belief that was worse 
than fear. It was bad that she was 
in danger of dying right here and 
now, but what was even worse 
was that the principles that had 
brought her to the Jug were dy- 
ing, too. 

Wipes were not the same as 
Civil-Service people! 

A bull’s roar from the corridor 
and a shocking crash of glass— 
that was Flock, and apparently he 
had smashed the TV interphone. 

“What in the world are they 
doing?" Inmate Bradley sobbed 
to herself. It was beyond compre- 
hension. They were yelling words 
that made no sense to her, threat- 
ening punishments on the guards 
that she could barely imagine. 
Sauer and Flock were laborers; 

MY LADY GREENSIEEVES 



some of the other rioting cons 
were clerks, mechanics — even 
Civil-Service or Professionals, for 
all she could tell. But she could 
hardly understand any of them. 
Why was the quiet little Chinese 
clerk in Cell Six setting fire to 
his bed? 

There did seem to be a pattern, 
of sorts. The laborers were rock- 
eting about, breaking things at 
random. The mechanics were 
pleasurably sabotaging the elec- 
tronic and plumbing installations. 
The white-collar categories were 
finding their dubious joys in less 
direct ways— liking setting fire to 
a bed. But what a mad pattern! 

The more Sue-Ann saw of 
them, the less she understood. 

It wasn’t just that they talked 
differently. She had spent endless 
hours studying the various patois 
of shoptalk and it had defeated 
her; but it wasn’t just that. 

It was bad enough when she 
couldn’t understand the words — 
as when that trusty Mathias had 
ordered her in wipe shoptalk to 
mop out her cell. But what was 
even worse was not understand- 
ing the thought behind the words. 

Sue-Ann Bradley had conse- 
crated her young life to the be- 
lief that all men were created 
free and equal — and alike. Or 
alike in all the things that mat- 
tered, anyhow. Alike in hopes, 
alike in motives, alike in virtues. 
She had turned her back on a de- 

27 



cent Civil-Service family and a 
promising Civil-Service career to 
join the banned and despised As- 
sociation for the Advancement of 
the Categoried Classes — 

Screams from the corridor out- 
side. 

Sue-Ann leaped to the door of 
her cell to see Sauer clutching at 
one of the guards. The guard’s 
hands were tied, but his feet were 
free; he broke loose from the 
clumsy clown with the serpent’s 
eyes, almost fell, ran toward Sue- 
Ann. 

There was nowhere else to run. 
The guard, moaning and gasping, 
tripped, slid, caught himself and 
stumbled into her cell. “Please!” 
he begged. “That crazy Sauer — 
he’s going to cut my ear off! For 
heaven’s sake, ma’am — stop him!” 

C UE-ANN stared at him, be- 
^ tween terror and tears. Stop 
Sauer! If only she could. The big 
redhead was lurching stiffly to- 
ward them — raging, but not so 
angry that the water-moccasin 
eyes showed heat. 

“Come here, you figger scum!” 
he roared. 

The epithet wasn’t even close 
— the guard was Civil Service 
through and through— but it was 
like a reviving whip-sting to Sue- 
Ann Bradley. 

“Watch your language, Mr. 
Sauer!” she snapped incongru- 
ously. 

28 



Sauer stopped dead and 
blinked. 

“Don’t you dare hurt him!” she 
warned. “Don’t you see, Mr. 
Sauer, you’re playing into their 
hands? They’re trying to divide 
us. They pit mechanic against 
clerk, laborer against armed 
forces. And you’re helping them! 
Brother Sauer, I beg—” 

The redhead spat deliberately 
on the floor. 

He licked his lips, and grinned 
an amiable clown’s grin, and said 
in his cheerful, buffoon bray: 
“Auntie, go verb your adjective 
adjective noun.” 

Sue-Ann Bradley gasped and 
turned white. She had known 
such words existed — but only 
theoretically. She had never ex- 
pected to hear them. And cer- 
tainly she would never have 
believed she would hear them, ap- 
plied to her, from the lips of a — 
a laborer. 

At her knees, the guard shrieked 
and fell to the floor. 

“Sauer! Sauer!” A panicky bel- 
low from the corridor; the red- 
haired giant hesitated. “Sauer, 
come on out here! There’s a mil- 
lion guards coming up the stairs. 
Looks like trouble!” 

Sauer said hoarsely to the un- 
conscious guard : “I’ll take care of 
you.” And he looked blankly at 
the girl, and shook his head, and 
hurried back outside to the cor- 
ridor. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



VI 



Guards were coming, all right 
— not a million of them, but half 
a dozen or more. And leading 
them all was the medic, calm, 
bearded face looking straight 
ahead, hands clasped before him, 
ready to heal the sick, comfort 
the aged or bring new life into 
the world. 

“Hold it!” shrieked little Flock, 
crouched over the agonizing blis- 
ter on his abdomen, gun in hand, 
peering insanely down the steps. 
“Hold it or-” 

“Shut up.” Sauer called softly 
to the approaching group: “Let 
only the doc come up. Nobody 
else!” 

The intern faltered; the guards 
stopped dead; the medic said 
calmly: “I must have my intern 
with me.” He glanced at the 
barred gate wonderingly. 

Sauer hesitated. “Well — all 
right. But no guards!” 

A few yards away, Sue-Ann 
Bradley was stuffing the syncoped 
form of the guard into her small 
washroom. 

It was time to take a stand. No 
more cowering, she told herself 
desperately. No more waiting. 
She closed the door on the guard, 
still unconscious, and stood grimly 
before it. Him, at least, she would 
save if she could. They could get 
him, but only over her dead body. 

Or anyway, she thought with 
a sudden throbbing in her throat, 
over her body. 

MY LADY GREENSLEEVES 



A FTER O’Leary and the medic 
left, the warden tottered to a 
chair — but not for long. His sec- 
retary appeared, eyes bulging. 
“The governor!” he gasped. 

Warden Schluckebier managed 
to say: “Why, Governor! How 
good of you to come—” 

The governor shook him off 
and held the door open for the 
men who had come with him. 
There were reporters from all the 
news services, officials from the 
township governments within the 
city-state. There was an Air GI 
with major’s leaves on his collar 
— “Liaison, sir,” he explained 
crisply to the warden, “just in 
case you have any orders for our 
men up there.” There were nearly 
a dozen others. 

The warden was quite over- 
come. 

The governor rapped out: 
“Warden, no criticism of you, of 
course, but I’ve come to take per- 
sonal charge. I’m superseding you 
under Rule Twelve, Paragraph A, 
of the Uniform Civil Service 
Code. Right?” 

“Oh, Tight!" cried the warden, 
incredulous with joy. 

“The situation is bad — perhaps 
worse than you think. I’m seri- 
ously concerned about the hos- 
tages those men have in there. 
And I had a call from Senator 
Bradley a short time ago—” 

29 



“Senator Bradley?” echoed the 
warden. 

“Senator Sebastian Bradley. 
One of our foremost civil serv- 
ants,” the governor said firmly. “It 
so happens that his daughter is in 
Block O as an inmate.” 

The warden closed his eyes. He 
tried to swallow, but the throat 
muscles were paralyzed. 

“There is no question,” the 
governor went on briskly, “about 
the propriety of her being there. 
She was duly convicted of a felo- 
nious act, namely conspiracy and 
incitement to riot. But you see the 
position.” 

The warden saw all too well. 

“Therefore,” said the governor. 
“I intend to go in to Block O 
myself. Sebastian Bradley is an 
old and personal friend — as well,” 
he emphasized, “as being a senior 
member of the Reclassification 
Board. I understand a medic is 
going to Block O. I shall go with 
him.” 

The warden managed to sit up 
straight. “He’s gone. I mean they 
already left, Governor. But I as- 
sure you Miss Brad — Inmate 
Bradley — that is, the young lady 
is in no danger. I have already 
taken precautions,” he said, gain- 
ing confidence as he listened to 
himself talk. “I — uh — I was de- 
ciding on a course of action as 
you came in. See, Governor, the 
guards on the walls are all armed. 
All they have to do is fire a cou- 



ple of rounds into the yard and 
then the ’copters could start drop- 
ping tear gas and light fragmen- 
tation bombs and — ” 

The governor was already at 
the door. “You will not,” he said; 
and: “Now which way did they 
go?” 

i I ’LEARY was in the yard and 
he was smelling trouble, loud 
and strong. The first he knew that 
the rest of the prison had caught 
the riot fever was when the lights 
flared on in Cell Block A. 

“That Sodaro!” he snarled, but 
there wasn’t time to worry about 
that Sodaro. He grabbed the rest 
of his guard detail and double- 
timed it toward the New Build- 
ing, leaving the medic and a cou- 
ple of guards walking sedately 
toward the Old. Block A, on the 
New Building’s lowest tier, was 
already coming to life; a dozen 
yards, and Blocks B and C lighted 
up. 

And a dozen yards more and 
they could hear the yelling; and 
it wasn’t more than a minute be- 
fore the building doors opened. 

The cons had taken over three 
more blocks. How? O’Leary didn’t 
take time even to guess. The in- 
mates were piling out into the 
yard. He took one look at the 
rushing mob. Crazy! It was Wil- 
mer Lafon leading the rioters, 
with a guard’s gun and a voice 
screaming threats! But O’Leary 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



didn’t take time to worry about 
an honor prisoner gone bad, 
either. 

“Let’s get out of here!” he bel- 
lowed to the detachment, and 
they ran. 

Just plain ran. Cut and ran, 
scattering as they went. 

“Wait!” screamed O’Leary, but 
they weren’t waiting. Cursing 
himself for letting them get out 
of hand, O’Leary salvaged two 
guards and headed on the run for 
the Old Building, huge and dark, 
all but the topmost lights of Block 
O. 

They saw the medic and his 
escort disappearing into the bulk 
of the Old Building and they saw 
something else. There were in- 
mates between them and the Old 
Building! The Shops Building lay 
between — with a dozen more cell 
blocks over the workshops that 
gave it its name — and there was 
a milling rush of activity around 
its entrance, next to the laundry 
shed — 

'The laundry shed. 

O’Leary stood stock still. Lafon 
leading the breakout from Block 
A. The little greaser who was a 
trusty in the Shops Building sabo- 
taging the yard’s tangler circuit. 
Sauer and Flock taking over the 
Greensleeves with a manufac- 
tured knife and a lot of guts. 

Did it fit together? Was it all 
part of a plan? 

That was something to find out 

MY LADY GREENSLEEVES 



— but not just then. “Come on,” 
O’Leary cried to the two guards, 
and they raced for the temporary 
safety of the main gates. 

The whole prison was up and 
yelling now. 

O’Leary could hear scattered 
shots from the beat guards on the 
wall — Over their heads, over their 
heads! he prayed silently. And 
there were other shots that 
seemed to come from inside the 
walls — guards shooting, or con- 
victs with guards’ guns, he 
couldn’t tell which. The yard was 
full of convicts now, in bunches 
and clumps; but none near the 
gate. And they seemed to have 
lost some of their drive. They 
were milling around, lit by the 
searchlights from the wall, yelling 
and making a lot of noise . but 
going nowhere in particular. Wait- 
ing for a leader, O’Leary thought, 
and wondered briefly what had 
become of Lafon. 

“You Captain O’Leary?” some- 
body demanded. 

LIE TURNED and blinked. 

Good Lord, the governor! 
He was coming through the gate, 
waving aside the gate guards, 
alone. “You him?” the governor 
repeated. “All right, glad I found 
you. I’m going into Block O with 
you.” 

O’Leary swallowed and waved 
inarticulately at the teeming cons. 
True, there were none immedi- 

31 



ately near by— but there were 
plenty in the yard! Riots meant 
breaking things up; already the 
inmates had started to break up 
the machines in the laundry shed 
and the athletic equipment in the 
yard lockers. When they found a 
couple of choice breakables like 
O’Leary and the governor, they’d 
have a ball! 

“But, Governor — ” 

“But my foot! Can you get me 
in there or can’t you?” 

O’Leary gauged their chances. 
It wasn’t more than fifty feet to 
the main entrance to the Old 
Building — not at the moment 
guarded, since all the guards were 
in hiding or on the walls, and not 
as yet being invaded by the in- 
mates at large. 

He said: “You’re the boss. Hold 
on a minute—” The searchlights 
were on the bare yard cobble- 
stones in front of them; in a mo- 
ment, the searchlights danced 
away. 

“Come on!” cried O’Leary, and 
jumped for the entrance. The 
governor was with him and a pair 
of the guards came stumbling 
after. 

They made it to the Old Build- 
ing. 

Inside the entrance, they could 
hear the noise from outside and 
the yelling of the inmates who 
were still in their cells. But 
around them was nothing but 
gray steel walls and the stairs go- 




ing all the way up to Block O. 

“Up!” panted O’Leary, and 
they clattered up the steel steps. 

They would have made it — 
if it hadn’t been for the honor in- 
mate, Wilraer Lafon, who knew 
what he was after and had headed 
for the Greensleeves through the 
back way. In fact, they did make 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



it — but not the way they planned. 
“Get out of the way!” yelled 
O’Leary at Lafon and the half- 
dozen inmates with him; and “Go 
to hell!” screamed Lafon, charg- 
ing; and it was a rough-and-tum- 
ble fight, and O’Leary’s party lost 
it, fair and square. 

So when they got to Block O, it 



was with the governor marching 
before a convict-held gun, and 
with O’Leary cold unconscious, a 
lump from a gun-butt on the side 
of his head. 

As they came up the stairs, 
Sauer was howling at the medic: 
“You got to fix up my boy! He’s 
dying and all you do is sit there!” 



The medic said patiently: “My 
son, I’ve dressed his wound. He 
is under sedation and I must rest. 
There will be other casualties.” 

Sauer raged, but that was as 
far as it went. Even Sauer 
wouldn’t attack a medic. He 
would as soon strike an Attorney, 
or even a Director of Funerals. It 
wasn’t merely that they were Pro- 
fessionals. Even among the Pro- 
fessional class, they were special; 
not superior, exactly, but apart. 
They certainly were not for the 
likes of Sauer to fool with and 
Sauer knew it. 

“Somebody’s coming!” bawled 
one of the other freed inmates. 

CAUER jumped to the head of 
^ the steps, saw that Lafon was 
leading the group, stepped back, 
saw whom Lafon’s helpers were 
carrying and leaped forward 
again. 

“Cap’n O’Leary!” he roared. 
“Gimme!” 

“Shut up,” said Wilmer Lafon, 
and pushed the big redhead out 
of the way. Sauer’s jaw dropped 
and the snake eyes opened wide. 

“Wilmer,” he protested feebly. 
But that was all the protest he 
made, because the snake’s eyes 
had seen that Lafon held a gun. 
He stood back, the big hands half 
outstretched toward the uncon- 
scious guard captain, O’Leary, 
and the cold eyes became 
thoughtful. 



And then he saw who else was 
with the party. ‘Wilmer! You got 
the governor there!” 

Lafon nodded. “Throw them in 
a cell,” he ordered, and sat down 
on a guard’s stool, breathing hard. 
It had been a fine fight on the 
steps, before he and his boys had 
subdued the governor and the 
guards, but Wilmer Lafon wasn’t 
used to fighting. Even six years in 
the Jug hadn’t turned an archi- 
tect into a laborer; physical exer- 
tion simply was not his metier. 

Sauer said coaxingly: “Wilmer, 
won’t you leave me have O’Leary 
for a while? If it wasn’t for me 
and Flock, you’d still be in A 
Block and—” 

“Shut up,” Lafon said again, 
gently enough, but he waved the 
gun muzzle. He drew a deep 
breath, glanced around him and 
grinned. “If it wasn’t for you and 
Flock,” he mimicked. “If it wasn’t 
for you and Flock! Sauer, you 
wipe clown, do you think it took 
brains to file down a shiv and 
start things rolling? If it wasn’t 
for me, you and Flock would have 
beaten up a few guards, and had 
your kicks for half an hpur, and 
then the whole prison would fall 
in on you! It was me, Wilmer 
Lafon, who set things up and you 
know it!” 

He was yelling and suddenly 
he realized he was yellfng. And 
what was the use, he demanded of 
himself contemptuously, of trying 



34 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to argue with a bunch of lousy 
wipes and greasers? They’d never 
understand the long, soul-killing 
hours of planning and sweat. 
They wouldn’t realize the impor- 
tance of the careful timing — of 
arranging that the laundry cons 
would start a disturbance in the 
yard right after the Greensleeves 
hard-timers kicked off the riot, of 
getting the little greaser Hiroko 
to short-circuit the yard field so 
the laundry cons could start their 
disturbances. 

It took a Professional to organ- 
ize and plan — yes, and to make 
sure that he himself was out of it 
until everything was ripe, so that 
if anything went wrong, he was 
all right. It took somebody like 
Wilmer Lafon — a Professional, 
who had spent six years too long 
in the Jug — 

And who would shortly be get- 
ting out. 

VII 

A NY prison is a ticking bomb. 

Estates-General was in proc- 
ess of going off. 

From the Greensleeves, where 
the trouble had started, clear out 
to the trusty farms that ringed 
the walls, every inmate was up 
and jumping. Some were still in 
their cells — the scared ones, the 
decrepit oldsters, the short-term- 
ers who didn’t dare risk their 
early discharge. But for every 

MY LADY GREENSLEEVES 



man in his cell, a dozen were out 
and yelling. 

A torch, licking as high as the 
hanging helicopters, blazing up 
from the yard — that was the 
the laundry shed. Why bum the 
laundry? The cons couldn’t have 
said. It was burnable and it was 
there— burn it! 

The yard lay open to the 
wrath of the helicopters, but the 
helicopters made no move. The 
cobblestones were solidly covered 
with milling men. The guards 
were on the walls, sighting down 
their guns; the helicopter bom- 
bardiers had their fingers on the 
bomb trips. There had been a few 
rounds fired over the heads of the 
rioters, at first. 

Nothing since. 

In the milling mob, the figures 
clustered in groups. The inmates 
from Honor Block A huddled un- 
der the guards’ guns at the angle 
of the wall. They had clubs — all 
the inmates had clubs — but they 
weren’t using them. 

Honor Block A: On the out- 
side, Civil Service and Profession- 
als. On the inside, the trusties, the 
“good” cons. 

They weren’t the type for 
clubs. 

With all of the inmates, you 
looked at them and you won- 
dered what twisted devil had got 
into their heads to land them in 
the Jug. Oh, perhaps you could 
understand it — a little bit, at 

35 



least — in the case of the figgers 
in Blocks B and C, the greasers 
in the Shop Building — that sort. 
It was easy enough for some of 
the Categoried Classes to commit 
a crime and thereby land in jail. 

Who could blame a wipe for 
trying to “pass” if he thought he 
could get away with it? But when 
he didn’t get away with it, he 
wound up in the Jug and that was 
logical enough. And greasers liked 
Civil-Service women — everyone 
knew that. 

There was almost a sort of 
logic to it, even if it was a sort of 
inevitable logic that made decent 
Civil-Service people see red. You 
had to enforce the laws against 
rape if, for instance, a greaser 
should ask an innocent young fe- 
male postal clerk for a date. But 
you could understand what drove 
him to it. The Jug was full of 
criminals of that sort. And the 
Jug was the place for them. 

But what about Honor Block 
A? 

Why would a Wilmer Lafon — 
a certified public architect, a Pro- 
fessional by category — do his own 
car repairs and get himself jugged 
for malpractice? Why would a 
dental nurse sneak back into 
the laboratory at night and cast 
an upper plate for her mother? 
She must have realized she would 
be caught. 

But she had done it. And she 
had been caught; and there she 



was, this wild night, huddled un- 
der the helicopters, uncertainly 
waving the handle of a floor mop. 
It was a club. 

She shivered and turned to the 
stocky convict next to her. “Why 
don’t they break down the gate?” 
she demanded. “How long are we 
going to hang around here, wait- 
ing for the guards to get organ- 
ized and pick us all off one at a 
time?” 

The convict next to her sighed 
and wiped his glasses with a beefy 
hand. Once he had been an In- 
come-Tax Accountant, disbarred 
and convicted on three counts of 
impersonating an attorney when 
he took the liberty of making 
changes in a client’s lease. He 
snorted: “They expect us to do 
their dirty work.” 

The two of them glared angrily 
and fearfully at the other convicts 
in the yard. 

And the other convicts, hud- 
dled greaser with greaser, wipe 
with wipe, glared ragingly back. 
It wasn’t their place to plan the 
strategy of a prison break. 

/^APTAIN LIAM O’LEARY 
muttered groggily: “They 
don’t want to escape. All they 
want is to make trouble. I know 
cons!” 

He came fully awake and sat 
up and focused his eyes. His head 
was hammering. 

That girl, that Bradley, was

leaning over him. She looked 
scared and sick. “Sit still! Sauer is 
just plain crazy — listen to them 
yelling out there!” 

O’Leary sat up and looked 
around, one hand holding his 
drumming skull. 

“They do want to escape,” said 
Sue-Ann Bradley. “Listen to what 
they’re saying!” 

O ’LEARY discovered that he 
was in a cell. There was a 
battle going on outside. Men were 
yelling, but he couldn’t see them. 

He jumped up, remembering. 
“The governor!” 

Sue-Ann Bradley said: “He’s 
all right. I think he is, anyway. 
He’s in the cell right next to us, 
with a couple guards. I guess they 
came up with you.” She shivered 
as the yells in the corridor rose. 
“Sauer is angry at the medic,” 
she explained. “He wants him to 
fix Flock up so they can — ‘crush 
out,’ I think he said. The medic 
says he can’t do it. You see, Flock 
got burned pretty badly with a 
knife he made. Something about 
the tanglefoot field — ” 

“Eddy currents,” said O’Leary 
dizzily. 

“Anyway, the medic — ” 

“Never mind the medic. What’s 
Lafon doing?” 

“Lafon? The Negro?” Sue-Ann 
Bradley frowned. “I didn’t know 
his name. He started the whole 
thing, the way it sounds. They’re 



waiting for the mob down in the 
yard to break out and then 
they’re going to make a break—” 
“Wait a minute,” growled 
O’Leary. His head was beginning 
to clear. ‘What about you? Are 
you in on this?” 

She hung between laughter and 
tears. Finally: “Do I look as if I 
am?” 

O’Leary took stock. Somehow, 
somewhere, the girl had got a 
length of metal pipe— from the 
plumbing, maybe. She was hold- 
ing it in one hand, supporting him 
with the other. There were two 
other guards in the cell, both out 
cold — one from O’Leary’s squad, 
the other, O’Leary guessed, a desk 
guard who had been on duty 
when the trouble started. 

“I wouldn’t let them in,” she 
said wildly. “I told them they’d 
have to kill me before they could 
touch that guard.” 

O’Leary said suspiciously: 
“You belonged to that Double- 
A-C, didn’t you? You were pretty 
anxious to get in the Greensleeves, 
disobeying Auntie Mathias’s or- 
ders. Are you sure you didn’t 
know this was going to—” 

It was too much. She dropped 
the pipe, buried her head in her 
hands. He couldn’t tell if she 
laughed or wept, but he could tell 
that it hadn’t been like that at all. 

“I’m sorry,” he said awkwardly, 
and touched her helplessly on the 
shoulder. 



MY LADY GREENSLEEVES

TIE TURNED and looked out 
the little barred window, be- 
cause he couldn’t think of any ad- 
ditional way to apologize. He 
heard the wavering beat in the air 
and saw them — bobbing a hun- 
dred yards up, their wide metal 
vanes fluttering and hissing from 
the jets at the tips. The GI ’cop- 
ters. Waiting — as everyone 
seemed to be waiting. 

Sue-Ann Bradley asked shak- 
ily: “Is anything the matter?” 
O’Leary turned away. It was 
astonishing, he thought, what a 
different perspective he had on 
those helicopter bombers from in- 
side Block O. Once he had cursed 
the warden for not ordering at 
least tear gas to be dropped. 

He said harshly: “Nothing. Just 
that the ’copters have the place 
surrounded.” 

“Does it make any difference?” 
He shrugged. Does it make a 
difference? The difference be- 
tween trouble and tragedy, or so 
it now seemed to Captain O’Leary. 
The riot was trouble. They could 
handle it, one way or another. It 
was his job, any guard’s job, to 
handle prison trouble. 

But to bring the GIs into it 
was to invite race riot. Not prison 
riot — race riot. Even the de- 
classed scum in the Jug would 
fight back against the GIs. They 
were used to having the Civil- 
Service guards over them — that 
was what guards were for. Civil- 

38 



Service guards guarded. What 
else? It was their job — as clerk- 
ing was a figger’s job, and ma- 
chines were a greaser’s, and pick- 
and-shovel strong-arm work was a 
wipe’s. 

But the Armed Services — their 
job was to defend the country 
against forces outside — in a world 
that had only inside forces. The 
cons wouldn’t hold still under at- 
tack from the GIs. Race riot! 

But how could you tell that to 
a girl like this Bradley? O’Leary 
glanced at her covertly. She 
looked all right. Rather nice-look- 
ing, if anything. But he hadn’t 
forgotten why she was in E-G. 
Joining a terrorist organization, 
the Association for the Advance- 
ment of the Categoried Classes. 

Actually getting up on street 
corners and proposing that greas- 
ers’ children be allowed to go to 
school with GIs, that wipes inter- 
marry with Civil Service. Good 
Lord, they’d be suggesting that 
doctors eat with laymen next! 

The girl said evenly: “Don’t 
look at me that way. I’m not a 
monster.” 

O’Leary coughed. “Sorry. I 
didn’t know I was staring.” She 
looked at him with cold eyes. “I 
mean,” he said, “you don’t look 
like anybody who’d get mixed up 
in — well, miscegenation.” 

“Miscegenation!” she blazed. 
“You’re all alike! You talk about 
the mission of the Categoried 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Classes and the rightness of seg- 
regation, but it’s always just the 
one thing that’s in your minds — 
sex! I’ll tell you this, Captain 
O’Leary — Td rather marry a de- 
cent, hard-working clerk any day 
than the sort of Civil-Service 
trash Fve seen around here!” 

O’Leary cringed. He couldn’t 
help it. Funny, he told himself, I 
thought I was shockproof— but 
this goes too far! 

A bull-roar from the corridor. 
Sauer. 

O’Leary spun. The big red- 
head was yelling: “Bring the gov- 
ernor out here. Lafon wants to 
talk to him!” 

O ’LEARY went to the door of 
the cell, fast 

A slim, pale con from Block A 
was pushing the governor down 
the hall, toward Sauer and Lafon. 
The governor was a strong man, 
but he didn’t struggle. His face 
was as composed and remote as 
the medic’s; if he was afraid, he 
concealed it extremely well. 

Sue-Ann Bradley stood beside 
O’Leary. “What’s happening?” 

He kept his eyes on what was 
going on. “Lafon is going to try to 
use the governor as a shield, I 
think.” The voice of Lafon was 
loud, but the noises outside made 
it hard to understand. But 
O’Leary could make out what the 
dark ex-Professional was saying: 
“— know damn well you did some- 



thing. But what? Why don’t they 
crush out?” 

Mumble-mumble from the Gov- 
ernor. O’Leary couldn’t hear the 
words. 

But he could see the effect of 
them in Lafon’s face, hear the 
rage in Lafon’s voice. “Don’t call 
me a liar, you civvy punk! You 
did something. I had it all 
planned, do you hear me? The 
laundry boys were going to rush 
the gate, the Block A bunch 
would follow —and then I was go- 
ing to breeze right through. But 
you loused it up somehow. You 
must’ve!” 

His voice was rising to a 
scream. O’Leary, watching tautly 
from the cell, thought: He’s go- 
ing to break. He can’t hold it in 
much longer. 

“All right?’ shouted Lafon, and 
even Sauer, looming behind him, 
looked alarmed. “It doesn’t mat- 
ter what you did. I’ve got you 
now and you are going to get me 
out of here. You hear? I’ve got 
this gun and the two of us are 
going to walk right out, through 
the gate, and if anybody tries to 
stop us—” 

“Hey,” said Sauer, waking up. 

“—if anybody tries to stop us, 
you’ll get a bullet right in—” 

“Hey!" Sauer was roaring loud 
as Lafon himself now. ‘What’s 
this talk about the two of you? 
You aren’t going to leave me and 
Flock!” 



MY LADY OIEENSIEEVES 



39 



“Shut up,” Lafon said conver- 
sationally, without taking his eyes 
off the governor. 

But Sauer, just then, was not 
the man to say “shut up” to, and 
especially he was not a man to 
take your eyes away from. 

“That’s torn it,” O’Leary said 
aloud. The girl started to say 
something. 

But he was no longer there to 
hear. 

It looked very much as though 
Sauer and Lafon were going to 
tangle. And when they did, it was 
the end of the line for the gov- 
ernor. 

P'APTAIN O’LEARY hurtled 
out of the sheltering cell and 
skidded down the corridor. Lafon’s 
face was a hawk’s face, gleaming 
with triumph. As he saw O’Leary 
coming toward him, the hawk 
sneer froze. He brought the gun 
up, but O’Leary was a fast man. 

O’Leary leaped on the lithe 
black honor prisoner. Lafon 
screamed and clutched; and 
O’Leary’s lunging weight drove 
him back against the wall. Lafon’s 
arm smacked against the steel 
grating and the gun went flying. 
The two of them clinched and 
fell, gouging, to the floor. 

Grabbing the advantage, 
O’Leary hammered the con’s head 
against the deck, hard enough to 
split a skull. And perhaps it split 
Lafon’s, because the dark face 



twitched and froth appeared at 
the lips; and the body slacked. 

One down! 

Now Sauer was charging. 
O’Leary wriggled sidewise and 
the big redhead blundered crash- 
ing into the steel grate. Sauer fell 
and O’Leary caught at him. He 
tried hammering the head as he 
swarmed on top of the huge 
clown. But Sauer only roared the 
louder. The bull body surged un- 
der O’Leary and then Sauer was 
on top and O’Leary wasn’t breath- 
ing. Not at all. 

Good - by, Sue - Ann, O’Leary 
said silently, without meaning to 
say anything of the kind; and 
even then he wondered why he 
was saying it. 

O’Leary heard a gun explode 
beside his head. 

Amazing, he thought, I’m 
breathing again! The choking 
hands were gone from his throat. 

It took him a moment to real- 
ize that it was Sauer who had 
taken the bullet, not him. Sauer 
who now lay dead, not O’Leary. 
But he realized it when he rolled 
over, and looked up, and saw the 
girl with the gun still in her hand, 
staring at him and weeping. 

He sat up. The two guards still 
able to walk were backing Sue- 
Ann Bradley up. The governor 
was looking proud as an eagle, 
pleased as a mother hen. 

The Greensleeves was back in 
the hands of law and order. 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The medic came toward 
O’Leary, hands folded. “My son,” 
he said, “if your throat needs—” 
O’Leary interrupted him. “I 
don’t need a thing, Doc! I’ve got 
everything I want right now.” 

VIII 

T NMATE Sue - Ann Bradley 
cried: “They’re coming! 

O’Leary, they’re coming!” 

The guards who had once been 
hostages clattered down the steps 
to meet the party. The cons from 
the Greensleeves were back in 
their cells. The medic, after fin- 
ishing his chores on O’Leary him- 
self, paced meditatively out into 
the wake of the riot, where there 
was plenty to keep him busy. A 
faintly guilty expression tinctured 
his carven face. Contrary to his 
oath to care for all humanity in 
anguish, he had not liked Lafon 
or Sauer. 

The party of fresh guards ap- 
peared and efficiently began re- 
locking the cells of the Green- 
sleeves. 

“Excuse me, Cap’n,” said one, 
taking Sue-Ann Bradley by the 
arm. “I’ll just put this one back—” 
“I’ll take care of her,” said Liam 
O’Leary. He looked at her side- 
ways as he rubbed the bruises on 
his face. 

The governor tapped him on 
the shoulder. “Come along,” he 
said, looking so proud of himself, 



so pleased. “Let’s go out in the 
yard for a breath of fresh air.” He 
smiled contentedly at Sue-Ann 
Bradley. “You, too.” 

O’Leary protested instinctively: 
“But she’s an inmate!” • 

“And I’m a governor. Come 
along.” 

They walked out into the yard. 
The air was fresh, all right. A 
handful of cons, double-guarded 
by sleepy and irritable men from 
the day shift, were hosing down 
the rubble on the cobblestones. 
The yard was a mess, but it was 
quiet now. The helicopters were 
still riding their picket line, glow- 
ing softly in the early light that 
promised sunrise. 

“My car,” the governor said 
quietly to a state policeman who 
appeared from nowhere. The 
trooper snapped a salute and 
trotted away. 

“I killed a man,” said Sue-Ann 
Bradley, looking a little ill. 

“You saved a man,” corrected 
the governor. “Don’t weep for 
that Lafon. He was willing to kill 
a thousand men if he had to, to 
break out of here.” 

“But he never did break out,” 
said Sue-Ann. 

The governor stretched con- 
tentedly. “He never had a chance. 
Laborers and clerks join together 
in a breakout? It would never 
happen. They don’t even speak 
the same language — as you have 
discovered, my dear.” 



MY LADY GREENSLEEVES

CUE-ANN blazed: “I still be- 
lieve in the equality of Man!” 
“Oh, please do,” the governor 
said, straight-faced. “There’s noth- 
ing wrong with that. Your father 
and I are perfectly willing to 
admit that men are equal — but 
we can’t admit that all men are 
the same. Use your eyes! What 
you believe in is your business, 
but,” he added, “when your be- 
liefs extend to setting fire to seg- 
regated public lavatories as a 
protest move, which is what got 
you arrested, you apparently need 
to be taught a lesson. Well, per- 
haps you’ve learned it You were 
a help here tonight and that 
counts for a lot.” 

Captain O’Leary said, face fur- 
rowed: “What about the warden, 
Governor? They say the category 
system is what makes the world 
go round; it fits the right man to 
the right job and keeps him there. 
But look at Warden Shluckebier! 
He fell completely apart at the 
seams. He — ” 

“Turn that statement around, 
O’Leary.” 

“Turn - ?” 

The governor nodded. “You’ve 
got it reversed. Not the right man 
for the job — the right job for the 
man! We’ve got Shluckebier on 
our hands, see? He’s been bom; 
it’s too late to do anything about 
that. He will go to pieces in an 
emergency. So where do we put 
him?” 



O’Leary stubbornly clamped his 
jaw, frowning. 

“We put him,” the governor 
went on gently, “where the best 
thing to do in a crisis is to go to 
pieces! Why, O’Leary, you get 
some hot-headed man of action in 
here, and every time an inmate 
sneezes, you’ll have bloodshed! 
And there’s no harm in a prison 
riot. Let the poor devils work off 
steam. I wouldn’t have bothered 
to get out of bed for it — except I 
was worried about the hostages. 
So I came down to make sure 
they were protected in the best 
possible way.” 

O’Leary’s jaw dropped. “But 
you were—” 

The governor nodded. “I was a 
hostage myself. That’s one way to 
protect them, isn’t it? By giving 
the cons a hostage that’s worth 
more to them.” 

He yawned and looked around 
for his car. “So the world keeps 
going around,” he said. “Every- 
body is somebody else’s outgroup 
and maybe it’s a bad thing, but 
did you ever stop to realize that 
we don’t have wars any more? 
The categories stick tightly to- 
gether. Who is to say that that’s 
a bad thing?” 

He grinned. “Reminds me of a 
story, if you two will pay atten- 
tion to me long enough to listen. 
There was a meeting — this is an 
old, old story — a neighborhood 
meeting of the leaders of the two

biggest women’s groups on the 
block. There were eighteen Irish 
ladies from the Church Auxiliary 
and three Jewish ladies from 
B’nai B’rith. The first thing they 
did was have an election for a 
temporary chairwoman. Twenty- 
one votes were cast. Mrs. Gross- 
inger from B’nai B’rith got three 
and Mrs. O’Flaherty from the 
Auxiliary got eighteen. So when 
Mrs. Murphy came up to con- 
gratulate Mrs. O’Flaherty after 
the election, she whispered : ‘Good 
for you! But isn’t it terrible, the 
way these Jews stick together?’” 

He stood up and waved a sig- 
nal as his long official car came 
poking hesitantly through the 
gate. 

“Well,” he declared profession- 
ally, “that’s that. As we politicians 
say, any questions?” 

Sue-Ann hesitated. “Yes, I guess 
I do have a question,” she said. 
“What’s a Jew?” 



TT WAS full dawn at last. The 
recall signal had come and the 
helicopters were swooping home 
to Hap Arnold Field. 

A bombardier named Novak, 
red-eyed and grumpy, was amus- 
ing himself on the homeward 
flight by taking practice sights on 
the stream of work-bound me- 
chanics as they fluttered over 
Greaserville. 

“Could pick ’em off like pi- 
geons,” he said sourly to his pilot, 
as he dropped an imaginary bomb 
on a cluster of a dozen men. “For 
two cents, I’d do it, too. The only 
good greaser is a dead greaser.” 
His pilot, just as weary, said 
loftily: “Leave them alone. The 
best way to handle them is to 
leave them alone.” 

And the pilot was perfectly 
right; and that was the way the 
world went round, spinning slowly 
and unstoppably toward the dawn.

The Martyr 

By ROBERT SHECKLEY 

There is no fate worse than 
death, eh? Well, maybe this 
will help change your mindl 



F RANK CADENA examined 
the tiny red dot which the 
hypodermic needle had left 
in his forearm. He said, “I don’t 
feel a thing.” 

“You’re not supposed to,” Dr. 
Mellen said. “No feeling is the 
proper feeling,” he added jovially. 
He was much bigger than Cadena 
and he exuded confidence. His 
large pale hands carried a faint 
aseptic odor of alcohol and green 
soap. 



His colleague, Dr. Santasiere, 
was seated at the desk. He was 
thin, sour-faced and very imper- 
sonal. 

Ignoring Cadena, he opened 
his little black bag and removed 
from it a Luger automatic, a si- 
lencer, an unmarked pillbox, a 
straight razor and a gas cylinder. 
Fussily, he arranged them on the 
desk, like tools on an operating 
table. 

“I really don’t feel a thing,” 



Illustrated by RAY 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Cadena said quickly. “Maybe it 
didn’t take.” 

“Don’t get nervous,” said Mel- 
len in his soothing professional 
tones. 

Dr. Santasiere took a hand- 
kerchief from his breast pocket 
and wiped the butt of the Luger. 
Then he turned the handkerchief 
over and intently cleaned his 
pince-nez. 

C ADENA WALKED to the win- 
dow. They were in Dr. Mel- 
len’s house, because it had seemed 
the safest place to conduct the 
last phase of the experiment Out- 
side was broad green lawn, and 
oak trees bordered the curved 
driveway, and Cadena could see 
two sparrows quarreling in the 
air. 

He licked his lips and rubbed 
the red dot on his forearm. 

“Well, shall we get on with 
it?” Dr. Santasiere asked. 

“Hold it, hold it,” Cadena said. 
“Maybe that stuff didn’t go to 
work yet.” 

“The effect is instantaneous,” 
Dr. Mellen assured him in a 
hearty but sympathetic voice. 

“Let’s give it a little more time 
to work,” Cadena begged. “Five 
minutes!” 

Dr. Santasiere frowned. “Since 
when does the patient dictate to 
the doctor?” 

“It doesn’t matter,” Dr. Mellen 
replied. “We’ll wait a few minutes 



if it will give you greater confi- 
dence, Frank.” 

“It sure will,” Cadena said. “It’ll 
sure do that” He began to pace 
up and down the room, mechani- 
cally rubbing the red dot on his 
forearm. 

“You will irritate the punc- 
ture.” Dr. Santasiere automatic- 
ally told him. 

Cadena all but giggled. “A hell 
of a lot that matters to me. Am I 
right? Does it really make any 
difference?” 

“It doesn’t matter at all,” Dr. 
Santasiere said. He began to pol- 
ish the straight razor with the 
edge of his handkerchief. 

Cadena paced for a few mo- 
ments more. Then he stopped 
abruptly and said, “Will you, for 
Pete’s sake, stop playing with that 
razor?” 

“No hysterics, Frank,” Dr. Mel- 
len warned. 

“Tell him to stop playing with 
that damned razor.” 

“He has a point,” Dr. Mellen 
admitted. “One shouldn’t show a 
patient the operating tools, you 
know.” 

Dr. Santasiere put the razor 
on the desk. With a stiffened fore- 
finger, he poked it into a straight 
line with the Luger, the silencer, 
the unmarked pillbox and the gas 
cylinder. 

“Stop playing with that damned 
razor!” Cadena shouted. “You’ll 
get to use it soon enough. Five

minutes! Just stop playing with 
it now.” 

“Don’t lose your nerve, Frank,” 
Dr. Mellen said. “Sit down. Relax. 
Try to compose yourself.” 

Cadena’s thin face was glisten- 
ing with perspiration. He dropped 
into a chair and exhaustedly 
closed his eyes. 

On the desk, an electric clock 
hummed, its second hand creep- 
ing implacably. Cadena's eyes 
snapped open. 

“Don’t sneak up on me,” he 
said. 

“No one is going to sneak up 
on you,” said Dr. Mellen wearily. 
“I think we should get on with it, 
Frank.” 

“Five minutes more!” 

“Further delay will just unset- 
tle you. Let’s finish it now.” 

T\R. SANTASIERE stood up, 
removed his jacket and 
rolled up his sleeves. Dr. Mellen 
asked, “What method would you 
prefer, Frank?” 

“None. None of them . .” 

“Oh, come now,” Dr. Mellen 
said sternly. “You have an excel- 
lent assortment. These pills are 
tasteless. The gas has an odor, 
strong but not unpleasant. Per- 
haps, though, the simplest method 
would be to open a vein in your 
wrist, like the Romans of old.” 
“Tell me again about the se- 
rum,” Cadena begged. 

“Again? But really — ” 



“Tell me again. Go on, tell me.” 

“Very well. As per agreement, 
I have injected you with a serum 
developed by Dr. Santasiere and 
myself, which confers the power 
of complete and instant regenera- 
tion.” 

“Say it straight!” Cadena said. 
“It’s an immortality serum! That’s 
what you told me before.” 

“Yes, if you prefer that phrase- 
ology.” 

“I’m immortal right now!” Ca- 
dena cried. 

“We have every reason to be- 
lieve so. All that remains is this 
final test, in the interest of science. 
Now, Frank, if you will choose 
your method — ” 

“But how do I know?” Cadena 
asked. “How can I be absolutely 
sure?” 

“We’ve been through this again 
and again,” Dr. Santasiere said. 
“The serum works on guinea 
pigs, on rabbits and on Rhesus 
monkeys. You have seen the re- 
sults yourself. They are unkillable 
by every single method we could 
devised.” 

“But I’m no ape,” Cadena ob- 
jected. “I’m a man. How do I 
know it’ll work on me? There are 
a lot of angles to this thing I 
didn’t figure on.” 

Dr. Mellen held out the pill- 
box. “Swallow two of these, 
Frank.” 

Cadena held the pillbox in his 
hand. “It’s worth more than a

lousy thousand dollars, the risk 
I’m taking.” 

“A thousand dollars and im- 
mortality,” Dr. Mellen pointed 
out. 

“So I’m immortal right now,” 
Cadena said slowly. “You’re 
sure?” 

“Positive.” 

“But I don’t feel any different. 
I feel just the same as always.” 

“Take the pills, Frank,” Mellen 
said. “Or if you prefer the ra- 
zor — ” 

“Forget the damned razor.” Ca- 
dena walked again to the window 
and looked at the green lawn and 
the oak trees. He turned, took a 
deep breath and said, “You can 
have back the thousand.” 

“What?” 

“I want out. Immortality or 
sudden death — it’s just too big a 
gamble. You can understand that, 
can’t you?” 

“Take the pills, Frank,” Mellen 
said flatly. 

ADENA THREW the pillbox 
across the room and ran to- 
ward the door. Mellen picked up 
the Luger, fitted the silencer to it 
and called, “Wait, Frank! Don’t 
make me shoot you in the leg!” 

Cadena turned. “No, Doc! No!” 

Mellen took a firm stance, re- 
leased the safety and aimed. 

“Doc, please — ” 

“Don’t move, Frank. Let it be 
a clean shot.” 



Cadena stared, his mouth open, 
and saw Mellen’s finger turn 
white on the trigger. He tried 
to scream. The silenced Luger 
clicked harshly. Cadena was 
slammed against the door, jerked 
spasmodically and slid to the 
floor. 

“Beautiful shot,” Santasiere 
complimented. “Centered right 
through the heart. Beautiful!” 
“I used to do quite a bit of tar- 
get shooting,” Mellen said. “Steady 
grip is the answer. And trigger 
squeeze, of course.” 

“Of course,” Santasiere agreed. 
“I notice you didn’t use your free 
arm as a support.” 

“No, it was unnecessary for so 
short a distance. Besides, with a 
weapon as balanced as the Luger 
— well, anyone could have done 
it.” 

“Now, now. Don’t be modest. 
Shall we examine the patient?” 
Together they bent over Ca- 
dena’s body. 

“The wound has closed al- 
ready!” Mellen exclaimed. 

“Pulse is strong.” 

“Respiration normal.” 
“Magnificent!” Dr. Mellen said. 
“The serum is a complete success. 
Pity he made such a fuss.” 

“Look, his eyes are opening.” 
Cadena’s eyelids fluttered. 
Then his eyes opened wide. 

“Well, Frank, old boy,” Mellen 
said heartily, “I hope you aren’t 
angry at us.”

“It was part of the bargain,” 
Santasiere reminded him. 

“And you’re fine. You’re per- 
fectly all right. You are truly and 
demonstrably immortal, Frank!” 

Tj^RANK STARED at them, not 
-*■ answering. 

“Come, come,” Mellen said. 
“No sense being sullen. Speak up! 
How does it feel to have an un- 
limited life-span?” 

A thread of drool ran from Ca- 
dena’s mouth down his chin. His 
hands plucked aimlessly at the 
air, then reached vaguely for a 
patch of sunlight on the floor. 
“Frank!” 

His fingers closed on the sunlit 
patch and his hands came up 
empty. Cadena looked at his 
empty fingers and began to sob. 

“Trauma,” Dr. Santasiere 
sighed. “Of all the luck.” 

Dr. Mellen stood up glumly. 
“Complete idiocy, I suppose. The 
shock of a gun fired at him . .” 
“Apparently that did it.” 

“He was a martyr to science.” 
“Yes. But we have an idiot on 
our hands now. An immortal idiot. 
What do we do about it?” 

Dr. Mellen seemed perplexed 
for a moment. Then his face 
brightened. 

“Why, it’s obvious, Doctor. 
We’ll start researching at once 
for an antidote. Something to put 
poor Frank out of his misery.”

Marguerite Steen. Doubleday &

HP HE most striking thing about 
-■•Miss Steen’s horror story is 
its gentility. Perhaps that is what 
makes it so effective. Its admix- 
ture of upper-class English stuffi- 
ness and its tale of possession are 
just the proper weird combination 
to invest her story with a chill 
that studied mood-writing would 
not have achieved. 

The narrator of the story, an 
impressively titled nobleman, but 
in actuality a man of poor means 



who had been kicked about in 
his youth, runs across the one up- 
per student who had taken him 
under his wing during undergrad-

Always a moody person, Ar- 
nold Lewes, the friend, had grown 
even more introspective. His 
spookily assorted household; his 
broken-spirited yet defiant wife, 
his frighteningly unnatural son, 
and the woman who has some pe-

THE HUMAN ANGLE by Wil- 
liam Term. Ballantine Books, 
N. Y., $2.00 

W ILLIAM TENN is a “shock- 
ing humorist,” if such a breed 
exists. His yams race along in a 
bright, delightfully breezy fash- 
ion until the last sentence or so — 
and then comes the shocker. Of 
such genre is his off-track and 
completely novel “Flat-Eyed 
Monster.” After reading this airily 
grim offering, you’ll agree with 
Tenn that contact between alien 
races must be blindingly con- 
fusing. 

His classic “The Servant Prob- 
lem” formulates an ancient and 
basic truth in as different a story 
as you’re ever likely to enjoy. 
“Party of the Two Parts” is a rip- 
roaring farce dealing with the 
Gtetan equivalent of French post- 
cards and the efforts of the best 
legal minds to incarcerate the 
purveyor of said pornography un- 
der Galactic law, replete with 
plenty of loopholes for this liter- 
ally slimy character. 

It is almost a relief to find a 
couple of unTennable yams in 
the collection, just as a sort of 
proof that even he has his off 
moments, too. 



S-F: THE YEAR'S GREATEST 
SCIENCE-FICTION AND FAN- 
TASY, edited by Judith Merril. 
Gnome Press, Inc., N. Y., $3.95 

W ITH the decline in the num- 
ber of titles in this field, one 
would expect the anthologists to 
be hard hit. Well, one would be 
right if the sole criterion were 
quantity. However, some of the 
finest science fiction of all time is 
being produced and published 
right now. Miss Merril’s book is 
indication enough of that. 

The assortment is well varied 
and, with eighteen yams to choose 
from, there should be at least a 
few to tickle the fancy of any dev- 
otee. A legitimate cavil is the 
repetition of anthologization. With 
so much to choose from, Miss 
Merril could — and should — have 
avoided this evil. 

A cautionary note: the title is 
correct if you are female and 
have exactly the same tastes as 
the anthologist, for it is a collec- 
tion of unswervingly personal 
favorites.

grated into society with functions 
peculiar to their talents. 

Steve Cornell, an esper, is re- 
covering from accident shock 
after a car pileup. Several items 
just don’t add up, however. First 
of all, a perceptive such as he 
just doesn’t get into accidents 
with his faculties being what they 
are. 

Secondly, his fiancee has dis- 
appeared from the car without 
trace and he begins to doubt his 
own sanity when he meets blind 
response to his questions concern- 
ing her. The only thing that jells 
in his mind is a tickling memory 
of something wrong with the high- 
way signs when he met with his 
accident. 

He tracks them down and, by 
George O., he comes up with some 
answers to the crazy puzzle. 
There is a definite significance to 
the signs. 

I hate to give any more of the 
story away because Smith has 
succeeded in maintaining an air 
of suspense throughout his book 
and although there is what seems 
to be a tangled morass of paths, 
espers, Mekstrom’s disease, et al, 
he maintains credulity. 

You’ll go for this if you like 
suspense, crackling hard-boiled 
dialogue and a touch of Super- 
man. 

NERVES by Lester del Rey. 
Ballantine Books, N. Y $2.00

T'hEL REY’S premise is one 
that may be indigestible to 
the reader. He suggests an imme- 
diate future in which atomic 
energy has been harnessed for in- 
dustrial purposes for twenty years, 
at which time there is a sudden 
revulsion of public opinion. Con- 
gress is considering legislation 
outlawing atomic plants and is 
sending teams of Congressmen on 
investigative missions. 

If you can believe that a soci- 
ety based on the products of fis- 
sion can turn its back on its own 
technology — or, to analogize, if 
we were to outlaw internal com- 
bustion engines because far more 
Americans have been killed by 
them than by all our wars — then 
you should have no trouble enjoy- 
ing this yarn. The story itself is a 
well-paced effort that increases 
tension with every page. 

In a political maneuver de- 
signed to swing the pendulum of 
public opinion, Plant Director 
Palmer is attempting to produce 
quantities of an isotope that has 
proved effective in combatting 
the boll weevil. A friendly South- 
ern Congressman has promised to 
set up an experimental station 
that, if successful, should convert 
the agricultural populace to sup- 
port of the atomic facilities. That 
would assure his re-election and, 
as head of the committee, he 
could bottle up legislation. 

Unfortunately, the manufacture 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



of Isotope 1-713 leads to a break- 
down of one of the converters 
with uncontrollable “hot” stuff 
leakage and extreme danger of 
degeneration into Mahler’s Iso- 
tope, with a breakdown time 
measured in billionths of a sec- 
ond. That creates a nasty prob- 
lem and an interesting story. 

Just swallow the premise and 
enjoy the yarn. You can. 

THE ANSWER by Philip Wylie. 
Rinehart & Co., Inc., N. Y. & To- 
ronto, $1.50 

HP HE average reader will have 
a lot of unanswered questions 
on finishing this book, in spite of 
its title. 

Conditioned as we are in this 
field to speculation in every form, 
we insist that any yarn be intrin- 
sically logical within the bounds 
it sets for itself. It is not giving 
away too much to say that the 
story concerns two atomic tests, 
one American, one Russian. Each 
results in the death of an angel. 
It is easy to see what both re- 
actions will be and Wylie doesn’t 
disappoint us. 

The fable’s message is convinc- 
ing, viewed from a Sunday-school 
level, but this is aimed at adults 
and it wildly misses its target 

THE FAR TRAVELLER by 
Manning Coles, Doubleday & Co., 
Inc., N. Y., $3.00 



A MOST engaging ghost is the 
hero of Coles’ third venture 
into this medium. The unfortu- 
nate victim of a multiple drown- 
ing some eighty-five years previ- 
ous to the opening of the tale, he, 
the Graf or Duke, must haunt the 
halls of his castle until the status 
of his marriage is accepted by his 
familial descendants. 

Drowned attempting to save 
the life of his bride of two days, 
a commoner he had married 
against parental wishes, his per- 
sonal servant, Franz Bagel, was 
also drowned trying to save him. 
A British film company has come 
to his castle by permission of his 
descendant, the present Graf, to 
film, coincidentally, the story of 
his life. When a suspicious acci- 
dent incapacitates the leading 
man, our materialized hero be- 
comes the perfect choice for his 
own portrayer. 

Incognito as he may be, Graf 
Adhemar engenders semi-recogni- 
tion among the castle retinue and 
the director has his suspicions 
aroused as the Graf constantly of- 
fers pointers on the life of the 
drowned hero. He almost creates 
a ghostly impasse when he can- 
not understand why he should 
still have to wander wraithlike 
through the halls at midnight 
while busily engaged in fleshly 
play-acting during the day. 
Dleightful clowning.

the hall and had to duck to avoid 
banging his head on the door 
frame. On the way down the 
hall, he wondered just what sort 
of job he had drawn this time. 

Dan stopped at a door lettered: 
A SECTION 
J. KIELGAARD 
DIRECTOR 

A pretty receptionist goggled 
at him and said to go in. Dan 
opened the inner door. 

Kielgaard — big, stocky, expen- 
sively dressed — looked up and 
studied Dan as he came in. Ap- 
parently satisfied, he offered a 
chair, then took out a small plas- 
tic cartridge and held it in one 
hand. 

“Dan,” he said, “what do you 
know about subspace and null- 
points?” 

“Practically nothing,” admitted 
Dan honestly. 

|Z" IELGAARD laughed. “Then 
I’ll fill you in with the lay- 
man’s analogy, which is all 1 
know. Suppose you have a news- 
paper with an ant on the middle 
of the front page. To get to the 
middle of page two, the ant has 
to walk to the edge of the paper, 
then walk back on the inside. 
Now suppose the ant could go 
through the page. The middle of 
page' two is just a short distance 
away from the middle of page 
one. That going through, instead 
of around, is like travel in sub- 

56 



space. And a null-point is a place 
just a short distance away, going 
through subspace. The middle of 
page two, for instance, is a null- 
point for the middle of page one.” 
“Yes,” said Dan patiently, wait- 
ing for the point of the interview. 

Kielgaard pushed the plastic 
cartridge he’d been holding 
through a slot in his desk. A globe 
to one side lighted up a cottony 
white, with faint streaks of blue. 
“This,” he said, “is Porcys.” 

Dan studied the globe. “Under 
that cloud blanket, it looks as if 
it might be a water world.” 

“It is. Except for a small con- 
tinent, the planet is covered with 
water. And the water is full of 
seafood — edible seafood.” 

Dan frowned, still waiting. 
“Galactic Enterprises,” said 
Kielgaard, “has discovered a re- 
gion in subspace which has Por- 
cys for one null-point and Earth 
for another.” 

“Oh,” said Dan, beginning to 
get the point. “And Earth’s hungry, 
of course. Galactic can ship the 
seafood straight through subspace 
at a big profit.” 

“That’s the idea. But there’s 
one trouble.” Kielgaard touched a 
button, and on the globe, the 
white layer vanished. The globe 
was a brilliant blue, with a small 
area of mingled green and gray- 
ish-brown. “The land area of the 
planet is inhabited. Galactic must 
have the permission of the inhabi- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tants to fish the ocean. And Ga- 
lactic needs to close the deal fast, 
or some other outfit, like Trans- 
Space, may get wind of things 
and move in.” 

Kielgaard looked at the globe 
thoughtfully. “All we know about 
the Porcyns could be put on one 
side of a postage stamp. They’re 
physically strong. They have a 
few large cities. They have an 
abundant supply of seafood. They 
have spaceships and mataform 
transceivers. This much we know 
from long-distance observation or 
from the one Porcyn we anesthe- 
tized and brain-spied. We also 
know from observation that the 
Porcyns have two other habitable 
planets in their solar system — 
Fumidor, a hot inner planet, and 
an Earthlike outer planet called 
Vacation Planet.” 

Kielgaard drummed his fingers 
softly. “Granting the usual course 
cf events, Dan, what can we ex- 
pect to happen? The Porcyns 
have an abundance of food, a 
small living area, space travel 
and two nearby habitable planets. 
What will they do?” 

“Colonize the nearby planets,” 
said Dan. 

^tJIGHT,” said Kielgaard. 

“Only they aren’t doing it. 
We’ve spied both planets till we 
can’t see straight. Fumidor has a 
mine entrance and a mataform 
center. Vacation Planet has a 



mataform center and one or two 
big buildings. And that’s it. 
There’s no emigration from Por- 
cys to the other two planets. In- 
stead, there’s a sort of cycling 
flow from Porcys to Vacation 
Planet to Fumidor to Porcys. 
Why? 

“The Porcyn we brain-spied,” 
he went on, “associated Vacation 
Planet with ‘rejuvenation.’ What 
does that mean we’re up against? 
Galactic wants to make a con- 
tract, but not till they know what 
they’re dealing with. There are 
some races it’s best to leave alone. 
This ‘rejuvenation’ might be 
worth more than the seafood, 
sure, but it could also be a sack- 
ful of trouble.” 

Dan waited, realizing that Kiel- 
gaard had come to the crux of the 
matter. 

Kielgaard said, “Galactic wants 
us to find the answers to three 
problems. One, how do the Por- 
cyns keep the size of their popu- 
lation down? Two, what is the 
connection between rejuvenation 
and ‘Vacation Planet’? And three, 
do the Porcyns have a proper 
mercantile attitude? Are they 
likely to make an agreement? 
Will they keep one they do 
make?” 

Kielgaard looked intently at 
Dan. “The only way we’re likely 
to find the answers in a reason- 
able time is to send someone in. 
You’re elected.”

“Just me?” asked Dan in sur- 
prise. “All your eggs in one bas- 
ket?” 

“In a situation like this,” said 
Kielgaard, “one good man is 
worth several gross of dubs. We’re 
relying on you to keep your eyes 
open and your mind on what 
you’re doing.” 

l, And suppose I don’t come 
back?” 

“Galactic probably loses the 
jump it’s got on Trans-Space and 
you miss out on a big bonus.” 
“When do I leave?” 

“Tomorrow morning. But today 
you’d better go down and pick up 
a set of Porcyn clothes we’ve had 
made for you and some of their 
money. It’d be a good idea to 
spend the evening getting used to 
things. We’ve implanted in your 
brain the Porcyn language pat- 
terns we brain-spied and we’ve in- 
stalled in your body cavity a sim- 
ple organo-transmitter you can 
use during periods of calm. Be- 
cause the Porcyns are physically 
strong and possibly worship 
strength, we’ve had your body re- 
built to one of the most powerful 
human physique patterns — that 
of an American Indian — that we 
have on record.” 

They shook hands and Dan 
went to his room. He practiced 
the Porcyn tongue till he had 
some conscious familiarity with it. 
Then he tried his strength to 
make sure he wouldn’t acciden- 

58 



tally use more force than he in- 
tended. Then, while the evening 
was still young, he went to bed 
and fell asleep. 

It was Dan’s experience that 
everything possible went wrong 
the first few days on a new planet 
and he wanted to be wide-awake 
enough to live through it 

II 

T HE next day, Dan left in a 
spacetug that Galactic was 
sending on a practice trip 
through subspace to Porcys. From 
the tug, he went by mataform to 
the lab ship in the Porcyn sea. 
Here he learned that he had only 
twenty minutes during which 
conditions would be right to make 
the next mataform jump to a 
trawler close to the mainland. 

Dan had wanted to talk to the 
men on the lab ship and learn all 
they could tell him about the 
planet. This being impossible, he 
determined to question the 
trawler crew to the limit of their 
patience. 

When Dan reached the trawler, 
it was dancing like a blown leaf 
in a high wind. He became miser- 
ably seasick. That evening, there 
was a violent electrical storm 
which lasted into the early morn- 
ing. 

Dan spent the whole night nau- 
seously gripping the edge of his 
bunk, his legs braced against the 

GALAXY SCIENCI FICTION 



violent heave and lurch of the 
trawler. 

Before dawn of the next day, 
aching in every muscle, his in- 
sides sore and tender, his mind 
fuzzy from lack of sleep, Dan was 
set ashore on a dark, quiet and 
foggy strip of beach. He stood for 
a moment in the soft sand, feel- 
ing it seem to dip underfoot. 

This, he thought, was undoubt- 
edly the worst start he had ever 
made on any planet anywhere. 

From around him in the im- 
penetrable fog came distant croak- 
ings, whistlings and hisses. The 
sounds were an unpleasant sug- 
gestion that something else had 
gone wrong. Between bouts of 
sickness, Dan had tried to arrange 
with the crew to land him near 
the outskirts of a Porcyn city. 
But the sounds were those of the 
open country. 

What Dan wanted was to go 
through the outskirts of the city 
before many people were moving 
around. He could learn a great 
deal from their homes, their 
means of transportation and the 
actions of a few early risers. He 
could learn from the things he ex- 
pected to see, or from the lack of 
them, if he was there to see them. 

Dan moved slowly inland, 
crossed a ditch and came to what 
seemed to be a macadam road. 
He checked his directions and 
started to walk. He forced the 
pace so his breath came hard, and 



hoped it would pump some life 
into his dulled brain and muscles. 

As his senses gradually began 
to waken, Dan became aware of 
an odd swish-swish, swish-swish, 
like a broom dusting lightly over 
the pavement behind him. The 
sound drew steadily closer. 

Dan halted abruptly. 

The sound stopped, too. 

He walked on. 

Swish-swish. 

He whirled. 

Silence. 

"ThAN listened carefully. The 
sound could be that of what- 
ever on Porcys corresponded to a 
playful puppy— or to a rattle- 
snake. 

He stepped sharply forward. 

Swish-swish. It was behind him. 

He whirled. 

There was a feeling of innu- 
merable hairy spiders running 
over him from head to foot. The 
vague shape of a net formed and 
vanished in the gloom before him. 
He lashed out and hit the dark 
and the fog. 

Swish-swish. It was moving 
away. 

He stood still while the sound 
faded to a whisper and was gone. 
Then he started to walk. He was 
sure that what had just happened 
meant something, but what it 
meant was a different question. At 
least, he thought ruefully, he was 
wider awake now.

He walked on as the sky grew 
lighter. Then the fog shifted to 
show a solid mass of low blocky 
buildings across the road ahead. 
The road itself disappeared into 
a tunnel under one of the build- 
ings. To one side, a waist-high 
metal rail closed off the end of 
one of the city’s streets. Dan 
walked off the road toward the 
rail. His eye was caught by the 
building ahead. Each was exactly 
the same height, about two to 
three Earth stories high. They 
were laid out along a geometri- 
cally straight border with no tran- 
sition between city and farmland. 

There was a faint hum. Then a 
long, low streak, its front end 
rounded like a horseshoe crab, 
shot out of the tunnel under the 
building beside him and vanished 
along the road where he’d just 
been walking. 

Now Dan saw a small modest 
sign beside the road. 

Care 

High-Speed 
Vehicles Only 
— Swept — 

Dan crossed the rail at the end 
of the street with great caution. 

The Porcyn clothing he was 
wearing consisted of low leather 
boots, long green hose, leather 
shorts, a bright purple blouse and 
a sky-blue cape. Dan bunched the 
cape in his hand and thrust it 

60 



ahead of him as he crossed the 
rail, for some races were finicky 
about their exits and entrances. 
The straight, sharp boundary be- 
tween city and farmland, and the 
identical buildings, suggested to 
Dan that here was a race con- 
trolled by strict rules and forms, 
and he was making an obviously 
unauthorized entrance. 

It was with relief that he stood 
on the opposite side, within the 
city. He glanced back at the sign 
and wondered what “Swept” 
meant. Then he gave his atten- 
tion to the buildings ahead of 
him. 

I - OW at first, the buildings rose 
regularly to a greater height, 
as far as the fog would let him 
see. Dan remembered the storm 
of the night before and wondered 
if the progressive heightening of 
the buildings was designed to 
break the force of the wind. The 
buildings themselves were mas- 
sive, with few and narrow win- 
dows, and wide heavy doors open- 
ing on the street. 

Dan walked farther into the 
city and found that the street 
took right-angle bends at regular 
intervals, probably also to break 
the wind. There was no one in 
sight, and no vehicles. 

Dan decided he was probably 
in a warehouse district. 

He paused to look at a partly 
erected new building, built on the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



pattern of the rest. Then he heard 
from up the street a grunting, 
straining sound interspersed with 
whistling puffs. There was a 
stamping noise, a thud and the 
clash of metal. 

Dan ran as quietly as he could 
up the street, stopped, glanced 
around one of the right-angle 
bends. He was sure the sound had 
come from there. 

The street was empty. 

Dan walked closer and studied 
a large brass plate set in the base 
of a building. It looked about 
twenty inches high by thirty wide 
with a rough finish. In the center 
of the plate was a single word : 

SWEEPER 

Dan looked at this for a mo- 
ment. Then, frowning, he strode 
on. In his mind’s eye, he was see- 
ing the sign by the road: 

Care 

High-Speed 
Vehicles Only 

— Swept — 

Dan couldn’t decide whether 
the word “Swept” was part of the 
warning or just an afterthought. 
In any case, he had plainly heard 
a struggle here and now there was 
nothing to be seen. Alert for more 
brass plates, he wound his way 
through the streets until he came 
out on a broad avenue. On the 

ADVANCE AGENT 



opposite side were a number of 
tall, many-windowed buildings 
like apartment houses. On the 
sidewalks and small lawns in 
front, crowds of children were 
playing. They were wearing low 
boots, leather shorts or skirts, 
brightly colored blouses and hose, 
and yellow capes. Walking qui- 
etly among them was a tawny 
animal with the look and lordly 
manner of a lion. 

It was a lion. 

As far as the rapidly dispersing 
fog let him see, the avenue ran 
straight in one direction. In the 
other, it ended a block or so away. 
Apparently the crooked, wind- 
breaking streets were only on the 
edge of the city. 

Dan thought of the questions 
Kielgaard wanted him to answer: 

1, how do the Porcyns keep the 
size of their population down? 

2, what is the connection be- 
tween rejuvenation and Vacation 
Planet? 

3, do the Porcyns have a proper 
mercantile attitude? Are they 
likely to make an agreement? 
Will they keep one they do 
make? 

To find the answers, Dan in- 
tended to work his way carefully 
through the city. If nothing went 
wrong, he should be able to see 
enough to eliminate most of the 
possibilities. Already he had seen 
enough to make Porcyns look un- 
promising. The rigid city bound- 

61 



ary, the strict uniformity of the 
buildings and the uniform pattern 
of the clothing suggested a case- 
hardened, ingrown way of living. 

A CROSS the street, a low door 
to one side of the apartment 
building’s main entrance came 
open. The lion walked out. 

It was carrying a squirming lit- 
tle boy by his bunched-up cape. 
The big creature flopped down, 
pinned the struggling boy with a 
huge paw and methodically 
started to clean him. The rasp of 
the animal’s tongue could be 
heard clearly across the street. 

The boy yelled. 

A healthy-looking girl of about 
twelve, wearing a cape diagonally 
striped in yellow and red, ran 
over and rescued the boy. The 
lion rolled over on its back to 
have its belly scratched. 

Dan scowled and walked to- 
ward the near end of the street. 
On less advanced planets, where 
the danger of detection was not 
so great, agents often went in with 
complex, surgically inserted or- 
gano-transmitters in their body 
cavities. Unlike the simple com- 
municator Dan had, these were 
fitted with special taps on the op- 
tic and auditory nerves, and the 
transmitter continuously broad- 
cast all that the agent saw and 
heard. Experts back home went 
over the data and made their own 
conclusions. 

62 



The method was useful, but it 
had led to some dangerous mis- 
takes. Sight and sound got across, 
but often the atmosphere of the 
place didn’t. Dan thought it might 
be the same here. 

The feeling that the city gave 
him didn’t match what his reason- 
ing told him. 

He crossed a street, passed an 
inscription on a building: 

Freedom 

Devisement 

Fraternity 

Then he was back in a twisting 
maze of streets. He walked till 
the wind from the sea blew in his 
face. 

The street dipped to a mas- 
sive wall and the sea, where a few 
brightly colored, slow - moving 
trawlers were going out. Dan 
turned in another street and 
wound back and forth till he 
came out along the ocean front. 
On one side of the street was the 
ocean, a broad strip of sand, and 
the sea wall. On the other side 
was a row of small shops, brightly 
awninged, with displays just be- 
ing set in place out in front. 

In the harbor, a ship was being 
unloaded. Flat-bottomed boats 
were running back and forth from 
several long wharves. On the 
street ahead, a number of heavy 
wagons, drawn by six-legged ani- 
mals with heads like eels, bumped 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and rattled toward the wharves. 
Behind them ran a crowd of boys 
in yellow capes, a big tawny lion- 
ess trotting among them. On the 
sidewalk nearby strode a few 
powerfully built old men, their 
capes of various colors. 

Dan glanced at the displays in 
front of the shops. Some were 
cases of fish on ice. Others were 
piles of odd vegetables in racks. 
Dan paused to look at a stack of 
things like purple carrots. 

A man immediately came for- 
ward from the rear of the store, 
wiping his hands on his apron. 
Dan moved on. 

The next shop had the univer- 
sal low boots, shorts, skirts, 
blouses and hose, in assorted sizes 
and colors, but no capes. Dan 
slowed to glance at the display 
and saw the proprietor coming 
briskly from the dark interior, 
rubbing his hands. Dan speeded 
up and got away before the pro- 
prietor came out. 

The Porcyns, he thought, 
seemed at least to have a proper 
mercantile attitude. 

Ill 

TYAN passed another fish mar- 
ket, then came to a big, 
brightly polished window. Inside 
was a huge, chromium-plated bar- 
bell on a purple velvet cloth. Be- 
hind it were arranged displays of 
hand-grips, exercise cables, dumb- 



bells and skipping ropes. The in- 
side of the store was indirectly 
lighted and expensively simple. 
The place had an air that was 
quiet, lavish and discreet. It re- 
minded Dan of a well-to-do fu- 
neral establishment. In one cor- 
ner of the window was a small, 
edge-lighted sign: 

You Never Know What the 
Next Life Will Be Like. 

In the other comer of the win- 
dow was a polished black plate 
with a dimly glowing bulb in the 
center. Around the bulb were the 
words: 

Your Corrected Charge — 
Courtesy of Save-Your-Life Co. 

A tall, heavily muscled man in 
a dark-blue cape stepped outside. 

“Good morning, Devisement,” 
he said affably. “I see you’re a 
stranger in town. I thought I 
might mention that our birth 
rate’s rather high just now.” He 
coughed deferentially. “You set 
an example, you know. Our main 
store is on 122 Center Street, so 
if you—” 

He was cut off by a childish 
scream. 

Down the street, a little boy 
struggled and thrashed near an 
oblong hole at the base of a build- 
ing, caught in a tangle of the 
mysterious ropes.

“A kid!" cried the man. He 
sucked in his breath and shouted, 
“Dog! Here, Dog! Dog!" 

On the end of a wharf, a crowd 
of children was watching the un- 
loading. From their midst, a lion- 
ess burst. 

“Here, Dog!” shouted the man. 
“A sweeper! A sweeper! Run, 
Dog!” 

The lioness burst into a blur of 
long bounds, shot down the wharf, 
sprang into the street and glanced 
around with glaring yellow eyes. 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




The little boy was partway in- 
side the hole, clinging to the edge 
with both hands. “Doggie,” he 
sobbed. 

The lioness crouched, sprang 
into the hole. A crash, a bellow 
and a thin scream came from 
within. The lioness reappeared, 
its eyes glittering and its fur on 
end. It gripped the little boy by 
the cape and trotted off, growling. 

“Good dog!” cried the man. 

Men in the shops’ doorways 
echoed his shout. 

“A kid," said the man. “They 
have to learn sometime, I know, 
but — ” He cut himself short. 
“Well, all’s well that ends well.” 
He glanced respectfully at Dan. 
“If you’re here any length of time, 
sir, we’d certainly appreciate 
your looking into this. And if 
you’re planning to stay long — 




well, as you see, our sweepers are 
hungry — our main store is on 
122 Center Street. Our vacation 
advisor might be of some service 
to you.” 

“Thank you,” said Dan, his 
throat dry. 

“Not at all, Devisement.” The 
man went inside, muttering, “A 
kid.” 

Dan passed several more shops 
without seeing very much. He 
turned the corner. Across the 
street, where the boy had been, 
was a dented brass plate at the 
base of the building. On Dan’s 
side of the street, trotting toward 
him, was a big, tawny-maned lion. 
Dan hesitated, then started up the 
street. 

There was a faint clash of 
metal. 

Swish-swish. 

A NET seemed to form in the 
air and close around him. 
There was a feel of innumerable 
hairy spiders running over him 
from head to foot. The net van- 
ished. Something wrapped around 
his ankle and yanked. 

The lion growled. 

There was a loud clang and 
Dan’s foot was free. He looked 
down and saw a brass plate la- 
beled SWEEPER. 

Dan decided it might be a good 
idea to see the Save-Your-Life 
Co.’s vacation advisor. He started 
out to locate 122 Center Street 



ADVANCE AGENT

and gave all brass plates a wide 
berth on the way. 

He strode through a briskly 
moving crowd of powerfully built 
men and women in capes of vari- 
ous colors, noticing uneasily that 
they were making way for him. 
He studied them as they passed, 
and saw capes of red, green, dark 
blue, brown, purple, and other 
shades and combinations of col- 
ors. But the only sky-blue cape 
he had seen so far was his own. 

A sign on the corner of a build- 
ing told Dan he was at Center 
Street. He crossed and the people 
continued to draw back for him. 

It began to dawn on Dan that 
he had had the ultimate bad luck 
for a spy in an unknown coun- 
try: He was marked out on sight 
as some sort of notable. 

Just how bad his luck had been 
wasn’t clear to him till he came 
to a small grassy square with an 
iron fence around it and a man- 
sized statue in the center. The 
granite base of the statue was in- 
scribed: 

I DEVISE 

The statue itself was of bronze, 
showing a powerful man, his foot 
crushing down a mass of snap- 
ping monsters. In his right hand, 
he held together a large circle of 
metal, his fingers squeezing shut 
a cut in the metal, which would 
break the circle if he let go. His 

66 



left hand made a partially open 
fist, into which a wrench had been 
fitted. The statue itself, protected 
by some clear finish from the 
weather, was plain brown in color. 

But the statue’s cape was enam- 
eled sky-blue. 

Dan stared at the statue for a 
moment, then looked around. In 
the street beside it, a crowd of 
people was forming, their backs 
toward him and their heads 
raised. Dan looked up. Far up, 
near the tops of the buildings, he 
could make out a long cable 
stretched from one building to an- 
other across the street. Just on 
the other side of the crowd was 
the entrance to the main store of 
the Save-Your-Life Co. 

T'kAN crossed the street and saw 
a very average-looking man, 
wearing an orange cape, come to 
a stop at the corner and look 
shrewdly around. 

Dan blinked and looked again. 
The man in orange was no Por- 
cyn. 

The man’s glance fell on the 
statue and his lips twisted in an 
amused smile. He looked up to- 
ward the rope, then down at the 
crowd, and then studied the backs 
of the crowd and the fronts of the 
stores around him, the lids of his 
eyes half-closed in a calculating 
look. 

A brass plate nearby popped 
open, a net of delicate hairy ten- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



drils ran over him, and something 
like a length of tarred one-inch 
rope snaked out and wrapped 
around his legs. An outraged ex- 
pression crossed his face. His 
hand came up. The rope yanked. 
He fell on the sidewalk. The rope 
hauled him into the hole. The 
brass plate snapped shut. From 
inside came a muffled report. 

It occurred to Dan that Galac- 
tic was not the only organization 
interested in Porcys. 

Dan looked thoughtfully at the 
brass plate for a moment, then 
walked toward the entrance of 
the Save-Your-Life Co., past dis- 
play windows showing weights, 
cables, parallel bars, trapezes and 
giant springs with handles on 
each end. 

He tried the door. It didn’t 
move. 

A clerk immediately opened 
the door and took Dan along a 
cool, chaste hallway to an office 
marked “Vacation Advisor.” Here 
a suave-looking man made an off- 
hand remark about the birth rate, 
took a sudden look at Dan’s cape, 
blinked, stiffened, glanced at 
Dan’s midsection and relaxed. He 
went through his files and gave 
Dan a big photograph showing a 
smiling, healthy, middle-aged cou- 
ple and a lovely girl about nine- 
teen. 

“These are the Milbuns, sir. 
Mr. Milbun is a merchant at 
present. Quite well-to-do, I under- 



stand. Mrs. Milbun is a house- 
wife right now. The daughter, 
Mavis, is with a midtown firm at 
the moment The mother became 
ill at an awkward time. The fam- 
ily put their vacation off for her, 
and as a result their charge has 
run very low. If you can get to 
their apartment without being — 
ah — swept, I feel sure they will 
welcome you, sir.” He scribbled a 
rough map on a piece of paper, 
drew an arrow and wrote “6140 
Runfast Boulevard, Apartment 
6B,” and stamped the paper 
“Courtesy of Save-Your-Life Co.” 

Then he wished Dan a healthy 
vacation and walked with him to 
hold open the outer door. 

Dan thanked him and went 
outside, where the crowd was now 
almost blocking the sidewalk. 
He forced his way free, saw some- 
one point, and glanced at the 
statue. 

The wrench in the statue’s left 
hand had been replaced by what 
looked like a magnifying glass. 

Dan had gone a few steps when 
there was a thundering cheer, 
then a terrified scream high in the 
air behind him. He turned around 
and saw a man come plummeting 
down. Dan gaped higher and saw 
a line of tiny figures going across 
high up on the rope. One of the 
figures slipped. There was another 
cheer. 

Dan hurriedly turned away. 

He had already convinced him- 



ADVANCE AGENT 



a 



self that the Porcyns had a 
“proper mercantile attitude.” And 
he thought he was beginning to 
get an idea as to how they kept 
their population down. 

IV 

/’’’AREFULLY avoiding brass 
^ plates, Dan made his way 
along an avenue of shops devoted 
to exercise and physical fitness. 
He came to Runfast Blvd. and 
located 6140, which looked like 
the apartment houses he had seen 
earlier. 

He tried the outer door; it was 
locked. When someone came out, 
Dan caught the door and stepped 
in. As the door shut, he tried it 
and found it was locked again. He 
stood for a moment trying to un- 
derstand it, but his sleeplessness 
of the night before was catching 
up with him. He gave up and 
went inside. 

There were no elevators on the 
ground floor. Dan had his choice 
of six ropes, two ladders and a 
circular staircase. He went up the 
staircase to the third floor, where 
he saw a single elevator. He rode 
it up to the sixth, got off and 
found that there was a bank of 
four elevators on this floor. 

He looked at the elevators a 
minute, felt himself getting dizzy, 
and walked off to locate apart- 
ment 6B. 

A powerfully built gray-haired 



man of middle height answered 
his knock. Dan introduced him- 
self and explained why he had 
come. 

Mr. Milbun beamed and his 
right hand shot forward. Dan felt 
like a man with his hand caught 
in an airlock. 

“Lerna!” called Milbun. “Lemal 
Mavis! We have a guest for va- 
cation!” 

Dan became aware of a rhyth- 
mical clinking somewhere in the 
back of the apartment. Then a 
big, strong-looking woman, obvi- 
ously fresh from the kitchen, hur- 
ried in, smiling. If she had been 
ill, she was clearly recovered now. 

“Ah, how are you?” she cried. 
“We’re so happy to have you!” 
She gripped his hand and called, 
“Mavis!” 

The clinking stopped. A beauti- 
fully proportioned girl came in, 
wearing a sweatshirt and shorts. 
“Mother, I simply have to get off 
another pound or so— Oh!” She 
stared at Dan. 

“Mavis,” said Mr. Milbun, “this 
is Mr. Dan Redman. Devisement, 
my daughter Mavis.” 

“You’re going with us!” she said 
happily. “How wonderful!” 

“Now,” said Mr. Milbun, “I 
imagine his Devisement wants to 
get a little rest before he goes 
down to the gym.” He glanced at 
Dan. “We have a splendid gym 
here.” 

“Oh,” said Mavis eagerly, “and 



68 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



you can use my weights.” 

“Thanks,” said Dan. 

“We’re leaving tomorrow,” Mil- 
bun told him. “The birth rate’s 
still rising here, and last night the 
charge correction went up again. 
A little more and it’ll take two of 
us to get a door open. It won’t 
inconvenience you to leave to- 
morrow?” 

“Not at all,” said Dan. 

“Splendid.” Milbun turned to 
his wife. “Lema, perhaps our 
guest would like a little some- 
thing to eat.” 

'X'HE food was plain, good and 
plentiful. Afterward, Mavis 
showed Dan to his room. He sank 
down gratefully on a firm, com- 
fortable bed. He closed his eyes. 

Someone was shaking him 
gently. 

“Don’t you want to go down to 
the gym?” asked Mr. Milbun. 
“Remember, we’re leaving to- 
morrow.” 

“Of course,” said Dan. 

Feeling that his brain was func- 
tioning in a vacuum, Dan fol- 
lowed the Milbuns into the hall, 
climbed down six stories on a lad- 
der, then into the basement on a 
rope. He found himself in a room 
with a stony dirt track around the 
wall, ropes festooning the ceiling, 
an irregularly shaped pool, and 
artificial shrubs and foliage from 
behind which sprang mechanical 
monsters. The Milbuns promptly 



vanished behind imitation vine- 
covered doors and came out again 
in gym clothes. 

Dan went through the doorway 
Mr. Milbun had come out of and 
discovered that the Save-Your- 
Life Co. had a machine inside 
which dispensed washed, pressed 
and sterilized gym clothes for a 
small fee. The machine worked 
by turning a selector dial to the 
proper size, pressing a lever, and 
then depositing the correct fee in 
an open box on the wall nearby. 
Dan studied this a moment in 
puzzlement, guessed his proper 
size and put the correct payment 
in the box. 

He put on the gym clothes and 
went outside. 

For forty-five minutes, mechan- 
ical creatures of odd and various 
shapes sprang at him from behind 
shrubbery, gripped him when he 
passed holes in the floor and 
wound themselves around his legs 
as he tried to swim in the pool. 

His temper worsened. He 
stopped to look at Mavis as she 
swayed, laughing, on a rope above 
two things like mobile giant clam- 
shells. 

Mr. Milbun shook his head. 
“Mavis, remember, we’re leaving 
tomorrow.” 

Just then, something snarled 
and lunged at Dan from the side. 
There was a flash of teeth. 

Dan whirled. His fist shot out. 
There was a scream of machin- 



ADVANCE AGENT 



69 



ery, then a crash and a clatter. 
An imitation monster with a huge 
jaw and giant teeth lay on its 
back on the koor. 

Milbun let out a slow whistle. 
“Dismounted it. Boy!” 

“A one-bite, too,” breathed 
Mavis. 

Mrs. Milbun came over and 
looked at Dan approvingly. 

Dan had been about to apolo- 
gize, but checked himself when 
the others smiled cheerfully and 
went back to what they were do- 
ing. This consisted of dodging, 
tricking or outrunning the various 
contraptions that lunged at them, 
chased them, tripped them, 
trailed, stalked and sprang out at 
them from nearly every place in 
the room. 

Finally the gym began to fill 
up with other people. The Mil- 
buns got ready to leave and Dan 
followed. 

AN lay in his bed that night 
and tried to summarize the 
points he didn’t understand. First 
was the question of vacation. But 
he supposed he would learn about 
that tomorrow. Next was “charge.” 
Apparently one went on vacation 
when his “charge” was low, be- 
cause the vacation advisor had 
said, “The family put their vaca- 
tion off for her, and as a result 
their charge has run very low.” 
But just what was “charge”? 

Dan remembered the flickering 



bulb in the store window, ringed 
by the words “Your Corrected 
Charge — Courtesy of Save-Your- 
Life Co.” Apparently he had some 
charge, because the bulb had 
flickered. But where did he get it? 

Then he thought of the water- 
front and of the little boy caught 
at the hole. What was the point 
of that? And why did that pro- 
duce such an uproar when, a little 
later, a grown man could get 
dragged out of sight on a well- 
traveled street and never cause a 
single notice? 

Dan felt himself sinking into a 
maze of confusion. He dismissed 
the problems and went to sleep 
clinging to one fact. The Porcyns 
must be honest people who would 
keep an agreement, once made. 
On what other planet could any- 
one find a slot machine with no 
slot, but just an open box for the 
money? 

Dan fell asleep, content that he 
had the answer to that part of 
the problem, at least. 

Before it was light, he awoke to 
an odd familiar buzz inside his 
head. 

“Dan,” said Kielgaard’s voice, 
small and remote. 

Dan rolled over, lay on his 
back and spoke sub-vocally. 
“Right here.” 

“Can you talk?” 

“Yes,” said Dan, “if I can stay 
awake.” 

“Can you give us a summary?” 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Sure.” Dan told him briefly 
what had happened. 

Kielgaard was silent a moment. 
Then he said, “What do you think 
‘charge’ is?” 

“I haven’t been in any condi- 
tion to think. Maybe it’s a surgi- 
cally implanted battery, set to 
run down after so long.” 

“Too clumsy. What about ra- 
dioactivity?” 

“ITm. Yes, you mentioned a 
mine on the inner planet. Maybe 
they mine radioactive ore. That 
would explain why I have some 
charge. There’s residual radioac- 
tivity even in the atmosphere of 
Earth.” 

“That’s so,” said Kielgaard. 
“But not every planet has it. I’m 
wondering about this other agent 
you mentioned seeing. He sounds 
to me like someone from Trans- 
Space. And that’s bad.” 

“They play dirty,” Dan con- 
ceded. 

«WORSE than that,” said 
Kielgaard’s tiny voice. 
“They recruit their agents from 
Lassen Two. Maybe that’s a 
break. Unlike Earth, Lassen Two 
is nearly radiation - free. And 
Trans-Space doesn’t use finesse. 
They’ll pump Porcys full of 
agents loaded down with organo- 
transmitters. Visual, auditory and 
olfactory. They’ll broadcast on 
every wave-length, suck out as 
much information in as short a 



time as they can, then either pull 
some dirty trick or slam the Por- 
cyns an offer. That is, if every- 
thing goes according to plan. 

“But meanwhile,” he added, 
“one or more of their agents is 
bound to stand in front of a free 
‘Your charge’ device somewhere 
in the city. Very likely, that agent 
will be radiation-free and some 
Porcyn, for the first time in his 
life, is going to see a bulb that 
doesn’t even flicker. If the Por- 
cyns are as scientifically ad- 
vanced as we think, and if Trans- 
Space is as dirty as usual, there 
may be a rat-race on before we 
know it.” 

Dan lay gloomily still. 

“Dan,” said Kielgaard, “where 
were you standing in relation to 
the other agent? Did he come up 
from behind or was he in front of 
you when you reached the 
statue?” 

“I was in front of him. Why?” 

“Because then you were in his 
range of vision. He may not have 
noticed you, but his organo-trans- 
mitter would. The chances are 
you appeared on the screen back 
at Trans-Space headquarters. 
They record those scenes as they 
come in and their experts go over 
them frame by frame. Unless you 
happened to be behind someone, 
they’ll see your image on the 
screen, spot you here and there in 
other scenes from other agents, 
study your actions and recognize

71 



you as an agent just as surely as 
you recognized their agent.” 
“Yes,” said Dan wearily, “of 
course they will.” He was think- 
ing that if he had been more 
awake yesterday, he would have 
thought of this himself and per- 
haps avoided it. But he couldn’t 
be alert without sleep and who 
could sleep in a heaving boat in 
a thunderstorm? 

“This changes things,” Kiel- 
gaard was saying. “I’m going to 
see if we can get a little faster 
action.” 

“I think I’d better get some 
more sleep,” Dan answered. “I 
may need it tomorrow.” 

“I agree,” said Kielgaard. 
“You’ll have to keep your eyes 
open. Good night, Dan, and good 
luck.” 

“Thanks.” 

Dan rolled over on his side. He 
tried for a moment to remember 
how the other agent had been 
standing and whether anyone had 
been between them to block his 
view, but he couldn’t be sure. Dan 
decided there was nothing to do 
but assume the worst. He blanked 
his mind. Soon a feeling of deep 
weariness came over him and he 
fell asleep. 

TN THE morning, Dan and the 
•*- Milbuns ate a hurried break- 
fast. Dan helped Mr. Milbun 
grease his rowing machine, 
weights, springs and chinning bar, 

72 



so they wouldn’t rust in his ab- 
sence. Milbun worked in a som- 
ber mood. All the Milbuns, in 
fact, were unusually quiet for a 
family going on vacation. When 
they went out into the hall, car- 
rying no baggage, they even took 
the elevator to the third floor. 

“Better save our strength,” said 
Mr. Milbun. 

The street seemed to Dan to 
have a different atmosphere. Peo- 
ple were walking quietly in 
groups, their eyes cool and alert. 
The Milbuns walked in front of 
the apartment houses Dan had 
passed the day before, and across 
the street he saw the place where 
the chiseled motto had read: 

Freedom 

Devisement 

Fraternity 

It was gone. Some workmen 
nearby were lifting a stone slab 
onto a cart. Dan blinked. The 
motto now read: 

Alertness 

Devisement 

Vigilance 

The Milbuns plainly noticed it, 
too. They drew closer together 
and looked around thoughtfully. 
Carefully keeping away from 
brass plates labeled SWEEPER, 
they followed a devious route 
that led to the statue. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The statue had changed, too. 
The hand that gripped the circle 
was now hidden by a massive 
shield. The other hand still held 
what looked like a magnifying 
glass, and the motto was still “I 
Devise.” But the shield gave the 
whole statue a look of strange 
menace. 

Across the street, near the 
place where Dan had seen the 
Trans-Space agent, stood several 
men wearing orange capes, barred 
black across the shoulders. Near- 
by, the brass plate opened and a 
man in work clothes handed out a 
box and went back in. 

At a store entrance up the 
street, watching them, stood an 
average-looking man in a purple 
cape, his look intent and calcu- 
lating. 

Mavis glanced at the statue 
and took Dan’s arm. “Devise- 
ment,” she said, “they won’t take 
you now, will they, before vaca- 
tion?” 

Dan kept an uneasy silence 
and Mr. Milbun said, “Of course 
not, Mavis. Where’s the belt?” 

Mavis glanced at the statue. 
“Oh.” 

Dan looked at the statue, then 
at Mavis and Mr. Milbun, said 
nothing and went on. 

They came to a large building 
with a long flight of broad wide 
steps. Across the face of the build- 
ing was boldly and sternly let- 
tered, high up: 



HALL OF TRUTH 

Lower down was the motto: 

“Speak the Truth — 

Live Yet a While With Us.” 

V 

ONE side of the stairs as 
they climbed was a statue of 
a man, smiling. On the other side 
was an urn with a bunch of 
carved flowers lying beside it. 

A big bronze door stood open 
at the top. They walked through 
into a large chamber with mas- 
sive seats in triple rows along two 
walls, and a single row of yet 
more massive seats raised along 
the farther wall. 

A bored-looking man got up 
from a low desk as the Milbuns 
sat down in three of the massive 
seats. 

The man asked in a dreary 
voice, “Have you, to the best of 
your knowledge, committed any 
wrong or illegal act or acts since 
your last vacation?” He picked up 
a whiskbroom and pan and 
waited for their answers. 

“No,” said the three Milbuns 
in earnest quavering voices. 

The man looked at each of 
them, shrugged and said boredly, 
“Pass through to your vacations, 
live law-abiding citizens.” He 
beckoned impatiently to Dan, 
turned to scowl at him, saw Dan’s

cape, stiffened, looked hastily out 
to the statue framed by the door- 
way, relaxed slightly and inquired 
respectfully, “Is it time for you 
to go on vacation, Devisement?” 

“It seems to be,” said Dan. 

“I think you should, sir. Then 
you’d be still more helpful if 
called.” 

Dan nodded noncommittally 
and sat down in one of the mas- 
sive chairs. His glance fell on an 
ornamental carving above the big 
doorway. It was a set of scales 
held by a giant hand. In one pan 
of the scales sat a smiling man. In 
the other was a small heap of 
ashes. 

“Have you,” asked the bored 
man, “to the best of your knowl- 
edge, committed any wrong or il- 
legal act or acts since your last 
vacation?” 

He readied the dustpan and 
whiskbroom. 

The Milbuns watched anx- 
iously at a door in the back of 
the room. 

Uneasily, Dan thought back 
and remembered rro wrong or il- 
legal acts he had committed since 
his last vacation. 

“No,” he said. 

The functionary stepped back. 
“Pass through to your vacation, 
live law-abiding citizen, sir.” 

Dan got up and walked toward 
the Milbuns. Another bored func- 
tionary came in wheeling a cart- 
ful of urns. He stopped at a mas- 



sive chair with a heap of ashes on 
the seat, a small pile on either 
arm, and two small piles at the 
foot. The functionary swept the 
ashes off and dumped them in the 
urn. 

A cold sensation went through 
Dan. He followed the Milbuns 
out into a small room. 

He felt an out-of-focus sensa- 
tion and realized the room was a 
mataform transmitter. An instant 
later, they were in a spaceship 
crowded with thoughtful-looking 
people. 

T IFE on the spaceship seemed 
to be given over to silent, mo- 
rose meditation, with an occa- 
sional groan that sounded very 
much like, “Oh, give me just one 
more chance, God.” 

When they left the ship, it was 
again by mataform, this time to a 
building where they stood in a 
line of people. The line wound 
through a booth where the color 
of their capes was marked on 
their foreheads, thence past a 
counter where they received 
strong khaki-colored capes, 
blouses and hose, and new leather 
shorts and boots to replace those 
they were wearing. They changed 
in tiny private rooms, handed 
their own clothing in at another 
counter, had a number stamped 
on their left shoulders and on 
their boxes of clothing. 

Then they walked out onto a 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



strip of brilliant white sand, 
fronting on an inlet of sparkling 
blue water. 

Here and there huddled little 
crowded knots of people, dancing 
from one foot to another on the 
hot sand and yet apparently 
afraid to go in the water. Dan 
looked to the Milbuns for some 
clue and saw them darting intense 
calculating glances at the beach 
and the water. 

Then Mr. Milburn yelled, “Run 
for it!" 

A slavering sound reached 
Dan’s ear. He sprinted after the 
Milbuns, burst through the crowd 
in a headlong bolt for the cove, 
then swam as fast as he could to 
keep up with them as they raced 
for the opposite shore. They 
crawled out, strangling and gasp- 
ing, and dragged themselves up 
on the sand. Dan lay, heaving in 
deep breaths, then rolled over and 
sat up. 

The air around them was split 
by screams, laced through with 
sobs, curses and groans. On the 
shore opposite, a mad dog darted 
across the crowded beach and 
emptied people into the cove. In 
the cove, a glistening black sweep 
of hide separated the water for 
an instant, then sank below. Peo- 
ple thrashed, fought and went 
under. 

Dan looked up. On the wooden 
building beyond the cove and the 
beach was a broad sign: 



PORCYS PLANET 
REJUVENATION CENTER 

Dan read the sign three times. 
If this was rejuvenation, the Por- 
cyns could have it. 

Beside Dan, Milbun stood up, 
still struggling for breath, and 
pulled his wife and Mavis to their 
feet. 

“Come on,” he said. “We’ve got 
to get through the swamp ahead 
of the grayboas!” 

T HE rest of the day, they 
pushed through slimy muck 
up to their knees and sometimes 
up to their necks. Behind them, 
the crowd screamingly thinned 
out. 

That night, they washed in icy 
spring water, tore chunks of meat 
from a huge broiled creature turn- 
ing on a spit and went to sleep in 
tents to the buzz and drone of 
creatures that shot their long nee- 
dle noses through the walls like 
drillers hunting for oil. 

The following day, they spent 
carefully easing from crevice to 
narrow toehold up the sheer face 
of a mountain. Food and shelter 
were at the top. Jagged rocks and 
hungry creatures were at the bot- 
tom. That night, Dan slept right 
through an urgent buzz from 
Kielgaard. The next night, he 
woke enough to hear it, but he 
didn’t have the strength to an- 
swer. 



ADVANCE AGENT 



75 



Where, he thought, is the re- 
juvenation in this? 

Then he had a sudden glim- 
mering. It was the Porcyn race 
that was rejuvenated. The unfit 
of the Porcyns died violently. It 
took stamina just to live from one 
day to the next. 

Even the Milbuns were saying 
that this was the worst vacation 
ever. Trails slid out from under 
them. Trees fell toward them. 
Boulders bounded down steep 
slopes at them. 

At first, the Milbuns tried to re- 
member forgotten sins for which 
all this might be repayment. But 
when there was the dull boom of 
an explosion and they narrowly 
escaped a landslide, Milbun 
looked at the rocks across the 
trail with sunken red eyes. He 
sniffed the air and growled, “Un- 
devised.” 

That afternoon, Dan and the 
Milbuns passed three average- 
looking men hanging by their 
hands from the limb of a tree be- 
side the trail. The faces of the 
hanging men bore a surprised ex- 
pression. They hung perfectly still 
and motionless, except for a slight 
swaying caused by the wind. 

Dan and the Milbuns reached 
a mataform station late that aft- 
ernoon. 

A very hard-eyed guard in an 
orange cape, barred across the 
shoulders in black, let them 
through and they found them- 

76 



selves in another spaceship, bound 
for Fumidor, the mining planet. 

T'k AN sat back exhausted and 
fell asleep. He was awak- 
ened by a determined buzz. 

“Dan!” said Kielgaard’s voice. 

“Yes.” Dan sat up. “Go ahead.” 

“Trans-Space is going to try to 
take over Porcys. There’s nothing 
you can do about that, but 
they’ve landed agents on Vaca- 
tion Planet to pick you off. Look 
out.” 

Dan told Kielgaard what had 
happened to the agents on Vaca- 
tion Planet, such as the “unde- 
vised” explosion and being hung 
up by the hands. 

Kielgaard whistled. “Maybe 
the Porcyns can take care of 
themselves. Trans-Space doesn’t 
think so.” 

“How did you find out?” 

The tiny voice held a note of 
grim satisfaction. “They ran an 
agent in on us and he gave him- 
self away. He went back with an 
organo - transmitter inside him, 
and a memory bank. The bank 
stores up the day’s impressions. 
The transmitter squirts them out 
in one multi-frequency blast. The 
agent is poorly placed for an in- 
formant, but we’ve learned a lot 
through him.” 

“How are they going to take 
over Porcys?” 

“We don’t know. They think 
they’ve found the Porcyns’ weak 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



point, but if so, we don’t know 
what it is.” 

“Listen,” urged Dan, “maybe 
we ought to put a lot of agents 
on Porcys.” 

“No,” said Kielgaard. “That’s 
the wrong way to play it. If we 
go in now, we’ll be too late to do 
any good. We’re still counting on 
you.” 

“There’s not very much I can 
do by myself.” 

“Just do your best. That’s all 
we can ask.” 

Dan spent the next week chip- 
ping out pieces of a radioactive 
ore. At night, Kielgaard would re- 
port the jubilant mood of Trans- 
Space. On the following days, 
Dan would chop at the ore with 
vicious blows that jarred him 
from his wrists to his heels. 

The steady monotonous work, 
once he was used to it, left his 
mind free to think and he tried 
furiously to plan what he would 
do when he got out. But he found 
he didn’t really know enough 
about Porcys to make a sensible 
plan. Then he began trying to or- 
ganize what he had seen and 
heard during his stay on the 
planet. At night, Kielgaard helped 
him and together they went over 
their theories, trying to find those 
that would fit the facts of Porcys. 

“It all hinges on population 
pressure,” said Kielgaard finally. 
“On most planets we know of, 
overpopulation leads to war, star- 



vation, birth control or emigra- 
tion. These are the only ways. At 
least, they were, till we discov- 
ered Porcys.” 

LL right,” agreed Dan. 
“Grant that. The Porcyns 
plainly don’t have any of those 
things, or not to any great extent. 
Instead, they have institutions 
such as we’ve never seen before. 
They have ‘sweepers,’ so-called 
Vacations’ and a rope from build- 
ing to building. All these things 
cut down population.” 

“Don’t forget their ‘truth 
chairs,’” said Kielgaard. 

“Where you either tell the truth 
or get converted to ashes — yes. 
But how does it all fit in?” 

“Let’s take one individual as an 
example. Start at birth.” 

“He’s bom,” said Dan. “Prob- 
ably they have nurseries, but we 
know they stick together as fami- 
lies, because we have the Milbuns 
to go by. He grows up, living at 
his parents’ place. He goes with 
other children to school or to see 
different parts of his city. A lion 
— which he calls a ‘dog’ — protects 
him.” 

“Yes,” said Kielgaard. “It pro- 
tects him from sweepers. But 
most grownups don’t need protec- 
tion. Only those whose charge is 
low.” 

“Of course. The boy hasn’t 
been on vacation yet. He’s not ra- 
dioactive. Apparently you have to 




ADVANCE AGENT 



77 



be radioactive to open doors. At 
the apartment house, the boy 
comes in a small door to one side. 
The lions, or what resemble lions, 
like the children but don’t like 
the sweepers. And the sweepers 
are afraid of them. All right. But 
what about when he grows up?” 
“Well, for one thing, he has to 
use the regular doors now. And 
they won’t open unless he’s been 
on vacation. And if he hasn’t been 
on vacation and if his charge isn’t 
high, the sweepers will go out and 
grab him. That must be what that 
sign you saw meant. ‘Swepf was 
a warning that there was no es- 
cape in that direction.” 

“I begin to see it,” said Dan. “I 
was safe on that road because the 
birth rate in that section wasn’t 
high. But in the city, the birth 
rate was high, so, to keep the pop- 
ulation down, the standards were 
raised. Apparently the sweepers 
were fed less and got more hun- 
gry. People had to go on vacation 
more often. But what about the 
rope?” 

66T DON’T think we really 
know enough to understand 
the rope,” said Kielgaard, ‘*but 
maybe it’s a face-saving device. 
People who don’t think they’re in 
good enough shape to get through 
‘vacation,’ and who don’t want to 
die a slow death avoiding sweep- 
ers and waiting to go through 
locked doors, can go across on the 

78 



rope. Or perhaps it’s a penance. 
If a man has done something 
wrong and he’s afraid to deny it in 
the truth chair, perhaps he’s al- 
lowed to confess and go so many 
times across the rope as punish- 
ment. The people cheered. That 
must mean it’s honorable.” 

“That makes sense,” Dan 
agreed. “All right, but why don’t 
they just ship their surplus popu- 
lation to the other two planets?” 

“We’ve studied that back here,” 
said Kielgaard. “We think it’s be- 
cause they wouldn’t dare. They’ve 
got their little mainland alloted 
and rationed down to the last 
blade of grass. They can do that 
because it’s small enough to keep 
control of. Now suppose they try 
to enforce the same system on a 
new planet with a hundred times 
the land area — what’s going to 
happen? They’ll have unknown, 
uncontrollable factors to deal 
with. Their system will break 
down. That statue of theirs shows 
they know it, too. The man in 
the blue cape ‘devises’ and his 
strong right hand does nothing 
but keep the circle — their system 
— from flying apart. What puzzles 
me is that they’re satisfied with 
it.” 

“There’s another point,” Dan 
said, “but I think I see it now. 
They’ve got a caste system, but 
people must be able to move from 
one caste to another. There must 
be a competitive exam or some 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



system of choice. The vacation 
advisor said Mr. Milbun was ‘at 
present’ a merchant. His wife was 
‘now’ a housewife. And no one 
ever asked my name, though I 
told it voluntarily to Milbun. It 
was always ‘Yes, Devisement,’ or 
‘Is it time to take your vacation, 
Devisement?’ There were no per- 
sonal titles like ‘Sir Moglin,’ or 
‘First Magistrate Moglin,’ such as 
we’ve encountered on other plan- 
ets.” 

Kielgaard grunted. “That would 
explain the differently colored 
capes, too. No one would care if 
a man was a street-cleaner ten 
years ago. They’d see his cape 
was blue and give him immedi- 
ate, automatic respect.” 

“Yes,” said Dan. “That’s it. 
And no one would dare cheat 
about the color of the cape he 
wore, because, regardless of his 
position, sooner or later his charge 
would be gone. Then he would 
have to go on vacation. And to do 
that, he has to sit in the truth 
chair and tell the truth or get in- 
cinerated.” Dan stopped suddenly 
and sucked in a deep breath. 

“What’s wrong?” asked Kiel- 
gaard. 

“That’s the weak point.” 

VI 



DY THE end of the week, 
Dan was able to pass through 
a door with a specialized type of 



Geiger counter in the locking cir- 
cuit 

And by that time, Kielgaard 
had noted sharp fluctuations in 
the mood at Trans-Space. There 
had been an interval of wild con- 
fusion, but it hadn’t lasted. Many 
more Trans-Space agents had 
gone to Porcys and Trans-Space 
seemed to be on top again. 

The instant Dan stepped from 
the mines through the door 
marked “Out,” he was rushed 
through a shower, a shave and a 
haircut, shoved into a truth chair 
and asked questions, given a new 
cape and clothes, and buckled 
into a glittering belt by a purple- 
caped man addressed as “Rever- 
ence.” No sooner was the belt in 
place than all, including “Rever- 
ence,” snapped to attention. 

“Devisement,” said a man in an 
orange-and-black cape, “we need 
your decision quickly. At home, 
men have usurped cloaks of de- 
visement and given orders con- 
trary to the public good. They 
wore belts of power, but did not 
die when their false orders were 
given. In the Central City, they 
convened a council, seated them- 
selves in the Hall of Truth, and 
on the very first oath every single 
one of them present was thrown 
into the life beyond. 

“Because the statue was already 
belted, men wearing cloaks of de- 
visement had to give the orders. 
But now they were all gone. Loot- 



ADVANCE AGENT 



79 



ers roamed the streets, breaking 
in doors. These men were vaca- 
tion-dodgers — out so long that 
they couldn’t even make a charge- 
light flicker — and the sweepers 
cleaned up some of them. But 
they killed the sweepers! IJevise- 
ment, I tell you the truth!” 

“I believe you,” said Dan. 
“Thank heaven. Devisement, 
something must be done. A young 
boy passed and graduated to the 
devisement cape, but before he 
could take action, he was shot 
from ambush. We found an old 
man of the right cape out in the 
country, and when we finally con- 
vinced him, he rounded up one 
hundred and fifty-seven vacation- 
dodgers and executed them. We 
had things in order, but now a 
glut of lunatics in devisement 
capes and belts of power have 
burst into the streets. Their or- 
ders are silly, yet their belts don’t 
kill them. They have no fear of 
the Truth. Business is stopped 
and men are hungry. The people 
are going wild. Strange boats 
have appeared offshore. Mata- 
form transmitters of odd design 
are being set up near the shore. 
This cannot go on without break- 
ing the circle!” 

Dan’s throat felt dry. 

“Sir,” said the Porcyn desper- 
ately, “you must devise some- 
thing! What shall we do?” 

A faint tingling at Dan’s waist 
suggested to him that he choose 

so 



his words carefully. One lie or 
bad intention and the belt of 
power would probably finish him. 

He thought carefully. The total 
power of the Porcyn planet must 
be at least the equal of even the 
huge Trans-Space organization. 
And Porcys had its power all in 
one place. The planet was organ- 
ized to the last ounce of energy, 
if only it could be brought to bear 
in time. 

Dan ordered his anxious com- 
panions to take him to Porcys. 

T^AR under the Central City, 

which was the city he had 
seen, he found a weary, powerful 
old man in a light-blue cape and 
glittering belt, directing operations 
from a television command post. 
The console showed street scenes 
of men in sky-blue capes and 
flashing belts, who danced and 
jabbered, their faces aglow with 
lunacy as they rapped out con- 
flicting orders and the people 
jerked and dashed this way and 
that, tears running down their 
faces. 

Near the statue, before the 
Hall of Truth, close ranks of Por- 
cyn men in orange-and-black 
capes stood massed on the steps, 
holding sleek-bored guns. On the 
street below, gibbering lunatics in 
sky-blue danced and shrieked or- 
ders, but the eyes of the men on 
the steps were tightly shut. By a 
technicality, they avoided obedi- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ence to the lunacy, for with their 
eyes shut, how could they be sure 
who gave the command? 

At the belted statue itself, a 
man in blue was clinging to one 
bronze arm as he slammed down 
a hammer to knock loose the 
partly broken circle. The statue 
obstinately refused to let go. At 
the base of the statue, holding a 
microphone, stood an average- 
looking man in a sky-blue cape, 
his lips drawn back in an amused 
smile. He gestured to men with 
crowbars and they tried to jam 
them between the statue and its 
base. This failing, they took up 
chisels and hammers. The man 
working on the circle shrugged 
and jumped down. 

At the console, the old man 
looked up at Dan. He put his 
hand out and felt Dan’s belt. Ap- 
parently the tingle reassured him 
and he seemed to accept Dan 
without further question. 

“This is about the end,” he said. 
“When that statue goes, those 
men will feel the jolt and open 
their eyes. They’re the last formed 
body of troops on the planet, and 
when they go, we’ll have nothing 
to strike with. There must be 
something I could devise for this, 
but I’ve been up three nights and 
I can’t think.” 

“Can you delay it?” asked Dan, 
grappling with the beginning of 
his plan. 

“Oh, we’ll delay it. I’ve got the 



last of the sweepers collected at 
the holes opening into the square. 
Just when that statue begins to 
tip, I’ll let the sweepers out. That 
will stop things for a while. Then 
they’ll kill the sweepers and my 
bolt is shot.” 

“Won’t the men you’ve got here 
fire on those blue-caped fakes?” 

“Devisement,” said the old man, 
shaking his head, “you know bet- 
ter.” 

“Are there any fire hoses? Will 
your men squirt water on the 
blue-caped ones?” 

“Yes,” said the old man, lean- 
ing forward. “They’ll get shot. But 
yes, they will. What is it? What 
are you devising?” 

rkAN outlined his plan. The 
old man’s eyes lighted. He 
nodded and Dan went out and 
climbed with guides through a 
grim, dark tunnel where the 
sweepers were kept. He peered 
out the hole, and as across the 
street the statue began to tip, he 
burst outside and sprinted into 
the square. 

The Trans-Space leader raised 
his microphone. 

Dan ripped it out of his hand 
and knocked him off his feet, then 
knelt and picked up the heavy 
shield that had been taken off the 
statue to get at the ring. 

A bullet hummed over Dan’s 
head. 

With a rush of air and a heavy 



ADVANCE AGENT 



81 



smash, the statue landed full 
length on the ground. Dan hauled 
himself up onto its base. Another 
bullet buzzed past him. Then 
there was a yell, and Dan looked 
down in the street 

The sweepers were horrible as 
they poured from their holes, but 
they looked almost beautiful to 
Dan. He glanced at the Porcyns 
massed on the steps, their faces 
white with near-hysteria. Their 
eyes were open and watching 
him; the Trans-Space men were 
too busy to give orders. 

Dan raised the microphone and 
his voice boomed out: 

“Close your eyes till you hear 
the roar of the lion! Then obey 
your true leaders!" 

He repeated the order three 
times before it dawned on the 
Trans-Space technicians that this 
was not according to plan. The 
loudspeaker gave a booming click 
and cut off. By then, the sweepers 
had been killed and Dan became 
aware of bullets thrumming past 
him. Suddenly he felt weak with 
panic that the rest of the plan had 
fallen apart. 

Up the street, Porcyn men 
were unscrewing a cap on the 
face of a building. They con- 
nected a hose. A sky-blue-caped 
Trans-Space agent ordered them 
away. The Porcyns turned, wads 
of wax in their ears, and raised 
the hose. 

A stream of water knocked the 




82 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




agents backward. Shots rang out. 
Porcyns fell, but other Porcyns 
took their places. The stream 
arched and fell on the Trans- 
Space agents and abruptly a whirl 
of color tinged the water. Blots 
and blobs of green, orange, pink 
and yellow spattered the blue- 
caped agents. 

At the end of the street, some- 
one ran up tugging a lion by the 
mane. 

“Go, dog! Run!” 

Somewhere a child cried out in 
terror. 

The lion roared. 

The troops on the steps opened 
their eyes. 

An old man’s voice, amplified, 
spoke out with icy authority: 

“Deploy lor street - fighting! 
First rank, move out along Cen- 
ter Street toward North Viaduct. 
Rifles at full charge. Wide inter- 
vals. Use every scrap of cover. 
Shoot the false-belted usurpers on 
sight. 

“Second rank, move out along 
West Ocean Avenue toward the 
sea wall ...” 

Shots rang out. 

There was a faint thrumming 
hum, like wires in the wind, and 
streaks of cherry radiance criss- 
crossed in the air. 

The lion roared, unable to find 
the child. The roars of other lions 
joined in. 

Dan was aware that he was ly- 
ing atop the hard base of the 



ADVANCE AGENT

statue, but he didn’t know how he 
had come to be there. He tried to 
stand up. 

He heard voices screaming or- 
ders, then falling still, and a scene 
swung into his line of sight like 
something watched through the 
rear-view mirror of a turning 
groundcar. 

Half a dozen men, guns in their 
hands, their bodies and blue capes 
spattered and smeared till they 
could hardly be recognized, lay 
motionless on the pavement. 

Then the scene swung up and 
away, and Dan felt weightless. 
Something hit him hard. His head 
bounced and he rolled over. Soft 
grass was in his face. It smelled 
fresh. 

There was a dull boom that 
moved the ground under him. 

He twisted his head to look up. 

A massive arm was stretched 
out over him, its hand firmly grip- 
ping the cut edges of a big metal 
ring. 

Somewhere a drum took up a 
steady monotonous beat. 

He fell into a deep black quiet 
and all the sights and sounds 
grew smaller and fainter and dis- 
appeared entirely. 

TXE AWOKE in a Porcyn hos- 
pital. Kielgaard was there, 
wearing a broad grin and brilliant 
Porcyn clothes and promising 
Dan a huge bonus. But it was all 
like a dream. 

84 



Kielgaard said the Porcyns 
were as mad as hornets. They 
had raised a battle fleet and it 
had taken a corps of diplomats 
and the Combined Intergalactic 
Space Fleet to argue them out of 
personally chopping Trans-Space 
into fine bits. No one knew what 
would finally happen, but mean- 
while Galactic had its contract 
and everyone was tentatively 
happy. 

His account finished, Kielgaard 
grinned more broadly yet and 
switched on a bedside televiewer. 

Dan lifted his head off the pil- 
low and looked at the screen. 
Then he stared. 

It was the statue, solid once 
more on its base, the ring grasped 
firmly in one hand and a big 
wrench in the other. But some- 
thing seemed different. 

Dan at last saw what it was. 

It was the face. It wasn’t a bad 
face, if one expected to see strong 
cheekbones, copper skin and a 
high-arched nose. 

“What a compliment!” he said, 
embarrassedly pleased. “I — hell, I 
feel like blushing.” 

“Make it a good one,” said 
Kielgaard. “After tomorrow, you’ll 
have to blush with your own face 
again.” 

“T omorrow?” 

“Sure. You’re still working for 
us, remember.” 

Dan sank back on the pillow 
and gazed up speculatively at the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ceiling. “All right, but I want 
some time off. I have a fat bonus 
to spend.” 

“You could use a holiday,” 
Kielgaard agreed. “Why not try 
the Andromedan cloud gardens? 
Pretty expensive, but with your 
bonus — ” 

“I’ve got a place picked out,” 
said Dan. “I’m going to take a va- 
cation on Porcys.” 

Kielgaard started. “You’re jok- 



ing! Or you’ve gone twitchy!” 
“No. Before I have to give this 
face back to Surgery, I ought to 
get a little enjoyment out of it. 
And what could be more enjoy- 
able than hanging around the 
statue, letting people see the re- 
semblance? Besides, they can’t 
make me take my vacation on the 
Vacation Planet — I’ve already 
had it.”

FORECAST 

To put it inadequately, next month’s lead story is THE IGNOBLE 
SAVAGES, a novelet by Evelyn E. Smith. To put it even inade- 
quately adequately, one must ask this sober question: Will Evelyn 
E. Smith Spoil Success? Only it’s too late; she already has. The writer 
of the most stylish prose since Jane Austen, she has reverence only 
for irreverence. The owner of the brightest wit since Dorothy Parker, 
she uses it to beam at stuffed shirts. Money is important to her; she 
considers the stuff funnier than any TV comic. She loves people — 
with hollandaise sauce. With all this as a background, you may think 
you can outguess her premise: The planet Snaddra has but one choice 
in its fight to live belowground — underhandedly pretend theirs is an 
aboveboard society. No, that’s confusing enough. Don’t try to figure 
it out; wait till next month to see who and how and why and what. 

Back at last comes Damon Knight with a tense and baffling 
novelet, AN EYE FOR A WHAT? This crew of terrestrial explorers 
think they couldn’t hurt a friendly alien if their lives depend on it — 
but now their lives do depend on it! 

Along with possibly another novelet and short stories and our 
usual features, Willy Ley disassembles with surgical sharpness and 
neatness a remarkably persistent piece of superstition in THE 
GREAT PYRAMID, THE GOLDEN SECTION AND PI. Accom- 
panying the surgery is an astonishing amount of back-to-date data on 
ancient Egypt and inside stories on the building of the most massive 
structure ever constructed by Man . which, as if it weren’t impres- 
sive enough, has been all but submerged by the most fantastic non- 
sense ever conceived by Man!

THE BOMB 

in THE BATHTUB 



By THOMAS N. SCORTIA 



Hate us? The bathtub bomb 
was ready to explode with 
admiration for all of usl 

Illustrated by MARTIN 



T HE young man said his 
name was Sidney Cole- 
man. He looked rather like 
a smooth-muscled distance swim- 
mer, lately taken to fat. At the 
moment, his eyes were sunken 
and wild-looking. 

“He said my bathroom was the 
center of a probability nexus,” 
the young man wailed. “And now 
there’s an H-bomb in my bath- 
tub.” 



Caedman Wickes rubbed a lean 
red hand across the scarred sur- 
face of his desk and winced at 
the gritty feel of dust under his 
palm. 

Then he closely inspected the 
coarse blond bristles on the backs 
of his fingers. 

“Does it do anything else?” he 
asked at last with great delibera- 
tion. “Tick, for instance?” 

“Nothing. It just lies there, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



eying the hot water faucet with 
that stupid blue eye and mouth- 
ing all sorts of platitudes.” 

“Isn’t this all a little ridicu- 
lous?” Wickes asked. 

“That’s what the police 
thought.” Coleman ran blunt fin- 
gers through close-cropped black 
hair. 

“No, I didn’t mean that. After 
all,” Wickes pointed out, “if 
you’re going to put anything as 
big as a bomb in the bathroom, 
the logical place is the bathtub.” 
“Logical to you, maybe.” 
Wickes touched his nose re- 
flectively and gestured toward the 
office door. Its chipped markings 
spelled in mirrored reverse: 
Caedman Wickes, Private Inves- 
tigator, Specializing in Odd Com- 
plaints. 

He said, “In my business, I 
often encounter the unusual. But 
there’s always an internal logic. 
That’s the guiding principle of my 
success. Always — always look for 
the internal logic. All else fol- 
lows.” 

TIE STEEPLED his fingers 
reminiscently. “I remember 
a client who thought he had a 
Venusian trapped in his washing 
machine. Very logical, if you stop 
to think about it. However — ” 
Wickes pursed his lips sorrow- 
fully— “it developed that he was 
quite mad. A pity, too. Such a 
lovely idea. Anyway, I meant the 

THE BOMB IN THE BATHTUB 



idea of using an H-bomb was ri- 
diculous. The best that such a 
bomb could do would be to vapor- 
ize the city and possibly the 
nearer suburbs. Hardly worth 
worrying about.” 

“He didn’t actually say it was 
an H-bomb,” Coleman said tiredly. 
“I just assumed that’s what it was. 
After all, he did say he wanted to 
destroy this universe.” 

“Ah!” Wickes’s eyes gleamed. 
“Not the Universe? Just this uni- 
verse?” 

“He made a {joint of that. He 
said there are an infinite number 
of probable universes. He just 
wants to destroy the best of all 
possible universes — this one.” 
“Undoubtedly paranoid,” 
Wickes commented. 

“Of course. This is part of his 
therapy. He’s insane.” 

“Then this isn’t his universe?” 
“I should think not. The cure 
wouldn’t be of much use if he de- 
stroyed the universe in which he 
exists, would it?” 

Wickes pursed his lips. “That 
doesn’t necessarily follow. Why, 
I remember—” 

Coleman leaped to his feet and 
leaned forward, bracing his hands 
on the desk. “Don’t! Don’t keep 
on reminiscing! That thing says 
it’s going to detonate this Tues- 
day. You’ve got to figure a way 
to defuse it.” 

“Patience, patience,” Wickes 
chided. “It never pays to lose 

S7 



one’s head about these things.” 

He unfolded his cadaverous 
six-foot-seven frame from behind 
the desk, secured a trenchcoat, 
black wool scarf and stained snap- 
brim felt hat from the top of a 
battered filing cabinet. 

“I really should smoke a pipe,” 
he mused as he donned the gar- 
ments, “but I do think the coat 
and hat are enough of a conces- 
sion to convention, don’t you?” 

“I don’t give a damn if you 
wear pink tights and fly through 
the air,” Coleman snorted. “Just 
do something about that bomb in 
my bathtub.” 

Wickes gestured limply toward 
the door. 

“I can see,” he said as they 
walked through the hall, their 
feet evoking protesting squeaks 
from the curling boards of the 
floor, “that you don’t appreciate 
the. essential beauty of the situa- 
tion.” 

“Beauty? How would you like 
a bomb in your bathtub?” 

“Not the point at all,” Wickes 
reproved. “Now this much re- 
minds me of the client who had a 
scheme to psychoanalyze his 
great - great - great - grandfather. 
Had a theory that neuroses were 
transmitted genetically. Well, he 
wanted me to ascertain the old 
gentleman’s whereabouts on a 
certain day in the early eighteen- 
thirties and—” 

Coleman was looking wildly to 



the right and left as they de- 
scended the stairs. Wickes de- 
cided to ignore his distress. Be- 
sides, the Adventure of the 
Retroactive Psychoanalysis, as he 
was fond of calling it, helped him 
develop the proper mood. 

He was a little annoyed, as 
they shared a taxi crosstown, that 
Coleman displayed such a lam- 
entable lack of interest in bear- 
ing his proper share of the con- 
versation. He fidgeted continually 
and evidenced a tendency to start 
at any loud noise. Once, when an 
auto backfired, he almost col- 
lapsed. 

No resiliency, Wickes thought, 
and clicked his tongue mentally. 

T'HE house was a small five- 
room contemporary in one of 
the newer developments on the 
fringe of the city. As Coleman un- 
locked the front door, Wickes 
stood looking up and down the 
block. 

“Odd,” he said. 

“What’s that?” 

“No television antennae.” 

“You won’t find any in this 
area,” Coleman explained. “We’re 
in a dead spot. Not even radio 
reception. That’s why I got the 
house so cheaply." 

As they entered the house, 
Wickes became aware of a thin 
atonal humming in the air. It had 
an odd musical quality without 
actually approaching melody. 



88 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Oh, I forgot to tell you,” Cole- 
man said. “It sings.” 

Wickes raised an eyebrow. 
“The bomb sings? In the bath- 
tub?” 

“In the bathtub.” 

“How appropriate,” Wickes 
said. 

While Coleman removed his 
hat and coat, Wickes crossed the 
living room, following the sound 
through a short hall to a large 
bathroom, done in shades of coral 
and rose. 

There was quite a large bomb 
in the bathtub. 

It had a single vacant-looking 
blue eye. It was staring at the hot 
water faucet and singing. 

“You see?” Coleman said from 
behind him. “The police wouldn’t 
believe me.” His voice was shrill 
and hysterical. 

“This is the best of all possible 
worlds,” the bomb said. “But to- 
morrow will be better.” 

“Interesting,” Wickes said. 

“What am I going to do?” Cole- 
man wailed. 

“Every day, in every way, 
things are getting better and bet- 
ter,” the bomb intoned. Its hum- 
ming rose in pitch a fraction of 
an octave. 

“Incurable optimist,” Wickes 
observed. 

“You!” Coleman sobbed. “Get 
out of my bathtub!” 

“Can’t,” the bomb said, inter- 
rupting its singing. “No legs. No 

THE BOMB IN THE BATHTUB 



arms. I won’t,” it added after a 
moment. 

It started to sing again. The 
music was oddly regular, with an 
internal consistency that Wickes 
found vaguely familiar. 

“What are you singing?” he 
asked. 

“Frankie and Johnnie,” the 
bomb said. For the first time, the 
blue eye moved from the faucet 
to stare at Wickes. “Like it?” 

“Well,” Wickes said, consider- 
ing, “it doesn’t sound much like 
Frankie and Johnnie." 

“It is, though,” the bomb said. 
“I’m coding it.” 

“It’s giving me a headache,” 
Coleman complained. 

“Philistine,” the bomb sneered, 
but the singing rose in pitch and 
quickly became inaudible. The 
eye returned to its fixed stare. 
This time, it chose the cold water 
faucet. 

“Y ou’d better lie down,” Wickes 
advised Coleman. 

TIE PULLED a tape measure 
from his pocket and began 
to measure the relationship of the 
fixtures in the bathroom to each 
other. Occasionally he clicked his 
tongue and made quick notes in a 
brown leatherette notebook. 

Coleman watched him silently. 

The bomb continued its idiot 
stare at the water faucet. 

Wickes mumbled something. 

“What’s that?” Coleman asked. 

89 



“Like Count Buffon’s needle 
problem,” Wickes said. “The ratio 
of the bathtub width to the width 
of the room.” 

“What about it?” 

“Three point one four one six,” 
Wickes intoned. “Pi, that is.” 

He nodded and pushed the 
bathmat up against the stool. 
Thoughtfully, he produced a pair 
of dice from his pocket. He be- 
gan to roll them on the floor, 
bouncing them against the tiled 
base of the tub. 

The dice repeatedly came up 
seven. 

“My advice,” Wickes said 
slowly. 

“Yes?” Coleman urged. 

“When this is all over—” 
“Yes?” 

“— I’d tear out the bathtub and 
install a dice table. Of course, 
you’d have to change the house 
rules somewhat, since each throw 
would be a seven, but—” 

He was speaking to an empty 
doorway. Coleman had stumbled 
weakly down the hall to collapse 
in a chair in the living room. 
From the bathroom, Wickes heard 
him groan softly. 

“This is the best of all pos- 
sible worlds,” the bomb said in a 
dogmatic tone. ' 

“Is it?” Wickes asked. 

“Oh, yes indeed. It has to be. 
Betcha,” it challenged smugly. 
Then it began to sing again. 
“Can’t you sing anything but 



Frankie and Johnnie?” Wickes 
asked. 

“That was Down by the Old 
Mill Stream.” 

“It sounded like Frankie and 
Johnnie.” 

“No breeding,” the bomb 
sniffed. “This is undoubtedly the 
best of all possible worlds,” it 
added after a moment. 

“Why?” Wickes demanded. 
“Oh, it just is.” 

“That’s not true, you know. Ac- 
tually, it’s a pretty .inferior 
world.” 

“It is not! It has to be the best!” 
“I’m afraid it’s not.” 

“Lies, lies!” the bomb ex- 
claimed passionately. “I’ll give 
you odds — any odds.” 

“You mean bet?” 

“Of course! Afraid?” 

“Why does it have to be the 
best of possible worlds?” 

“Put up or shut up.” 

“Why the best of possible 
worlds?” Wickes insisted. 

T HE bomb was silent. Then it 
began to hum in a rising cre- 
scendo. Wickes walked to the 
living room. Coleman was sitting 
in a chair, his head in his hands. 

“Frankie and Johnnie?” he 
asked wanly. 

“Down by the Old Mill 
Stream,” Wickes told him. 

“Mairzy Doats,” the bomb cor- 
rected from the bathroom. 

“You know,” Wickes said, “this 



90 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



could get quite maddening.” 

“Why didn’t you take the bet?” 
Coleman asked sarcastically. 

“No need to be snide. Besides, 
I never bet. Still, that bit is sig- 
nificant” 

“How so?” 

“Well, you can infer certain 
things about a society whose ma- 
chines like to gamble.” 

“Yeah,” Coleman said. “Maybe 
that universe has been conquered 
by a race of one-armed bandits 
from Las Vegas.” 

“Not in the least unlikely,” 
Wickes said. “Except that this one 
has no arms. Anyway, the world 
of the bomb certainly knows 
more about probability than we 
do.” 

“ ‘Find the internal logic’?” 
Coleman quoted. 

“Exactly,” Wickes said, with 
surprised approval. “I couldn’t 
have put it more succinctly my- 
self.” 

Wickes seated himself in a bar- 
rel chair and looked fixedly at the 
tips of his black shoes. Finally, he 
rose and walked to the phone on 
the table by Coleman’s chair. 

“It’s about time,” Coleman re- 
marked acidly. 

“Tush,” Wickes said. 

He dialed a number and spoke 
for a few moments. Then he 
dialed another number. After a 
short, low conversation, he re- 
placed the phone triumphantly. 

“Hah,” he said. 



“Hah?” Coleman queried. 
“Hah?” 

“Yes, hah. That was the pro- 
gram director of WWVI. They 
have a disk jockey on now.” 
“With a bomb ready to ex- 
plode,” Coleman cried, “he phones 
requests to disk jockeys. What 
did you ask for? Mairzy Doats?” 
“That wasn’t necessary. They’ve 
just played it. And before that, 
Down by the Old Mill Stream. 
And before that — ” 

“Frankie and Johnnie?” 
“Precisely. I see you under- 
stand my methods.” 

“Yes,” Coleman said weakly 
and sank back into his chair. 

“Now I must leave,” Wickes 
said. 

“With that still in there? What 
about me?” 

“Well, you could read to it,” 
Wickes suggested. 

Coleman stared as Wickes 
walked to a bookcase by the door 
and scanned the titles. He se- 
lected a book and handed it to 
Coleman. 

“This,” he said. 

“Crime and Punishment?” 

“A delightful book,” Wickes 
said. “So full of — of — ” He waved 
his hand uncertainly. “Of welt- 
schmerz. Oh, yes,” he said at the 
door. “If you get bored with that, 
try The Seven Who Were 
Hanged. A little healthy morbid- 
ity will do worlds of good— even 
for a bomb.” 



THE BOMB IN THE BATHTUB

And he closed the door with ap- 
propriate consideration. 

A FTER leaving Coleman, 
Wickes walked for several 
blocks, lost in thought. The situa- 
tion, he decided, did have its in- 
triguing points. The particular 
problem was the point of con- 
tact. Obviously nothing would be 
gained by merely defusing the 
bomb. The alien organization of 
therapists who had placed it there 
would merely try again, perhaps 
with more success. 

But how to move against those 
unpredictable minds in the un- 
guessable gamble? Rather like 
the great - to - the - fourth - 
power-grandfather acting against 
Wickes’s own psychoanalysis-bent 
client. 

The lever — if only there were 
some lever. But there was only 
the bomb with its insane opti- 
mism and wild gambling fever and 
equally insane habit of encoding 
popular songs. 

He stopped in the middle of 
the sidewalk, heedless of the 
glares of passersby. In seconds, 
his head was wreathed in a thick 
tobacco smoke of concentration. 
He became aware of his sur- 
roundings again only when the 
pipe stem grew too hot. 

He hailed a cab and gave direc- 
tions to the local branch library. 
There he spent some time among 
the math shelves, selecting first 

THE BOMB IN THE BATHTUB 



one volume on statistics and 
probability and then another. Fi- 
nally he found what he wanted, a 
long table of random numbers 
used in setting up random se- 
quences in physical experiments. 
When the librarian wasn’t look- 
ing, he stealthily tore out the two 
pages of the table and left. 

Then he went to a magic store, 
where he bought a deck of 
marked cards, a pair of trick dice 
and a book on roulette systems. 
In the taxi, he read through the 
opening chapters of the roulette 
book and finally tossed it from 
the window when the cab stopped 
for a red light. 

At his office, he made two 
phone calls, one to a friend who 
was an electronics engineer, the 
other to a friend who played the 
bassoon. Then he scrambled be- 
neath his filing cabinet until he 
found a battered tape recorder 
that he used as a dictaphone, 
drew on the trenchcoat and bat- 
tered hat, and headed for the 
street. 

After spending three hours 
with his bassoon-playing friend, 
he dropped by his engineer 
friend’s house to pick up the 
pieces of equipment that his 
friend had assembled for him. He 
stopped at a drugstore for a quick 
snack and arrived at Coleman’s 
house at seven-forty. 

“It’s about time,” the young 
man said. “I’m absolutely hoarse.” 

93 



He was carrying the copy of 
Crime and Punishment, his thumb 
inserted in a place about a third 
of the way through. As he closed 
the door, Wickes heard a faint 
muttering from the bathroom. 

“Lies, lies,” the bomb was say- 
ing. 

“It doesn’t like Dostoievsky,” 
Coleman sighed. 

“De gustibus non est disputan- 
dum," Wickes airily explained. 

“Yeah,” Coleman said uncer- 
tainly. 

“I,” Wickes announced grandly 
as he removed his coat with a 
flourish, “have been learning to 
compose for the bassoon.” 

He gestured toward the peel- 
ing leather case of the tape re- 
corder, which he had placed next 
to a featureless black suitcase. 

/"'OLEMAN stared at him with 
^ lips compressed. 

“Oh, hand me my coat a min- 
ute,” Wickes said. “That’s a good 
fellow.” 

He extracted several rolled 
newspapers, which he proceeded 
to unroll. Several items on the 
front pages were outlined in 
black. 

“Dostoievsky is all very well,” 
Wickes said, “but we mustn’t neg- 
lect current events.” He smirked 
knowingly. 

Coleman’s lips became even 
whiter. 

“Here,” Wickes said, handing 



Coleman a small package. 

“What is it?” Coleman asked 
hopefully. 

“Dice. We may want to get up 
a crap game.” 

“Have you gone—” 

“Mad? Oh, no. At least, not in 
the usual sense. Now let me see 
how this operates.” 

“This” was the enigmatic black 
suitcase from which Wickes ex- 
tracted a bewildering assortment 
of electronic parts. Following a 
diagram he took from his pocket, 
he began to connect the several 
units together. Eventually, he ran 
a long wire across the room, hang- 
ing it over the doorway and the 
living room drapes. 

“Antenna,” he explained. 

He found a wall plug and con- 
nected the device. Then he began 
to assemble the tape recorder. 

“Wait till you hear this,” he 
said. “Bassoon solo.” 

“The man has gone batty,” 
Coleman glumly told the walls. 

Wickes twisted several dials on 
the recorder and flipped a toggle 
on the other device. The room 
suddenly filled with the low-reg- 
ister grunts of a bassoon. The 
notes were long and anguished 
and made absolutely no melody. 

Coleman slapped his hands to 
his ears as the discordance was 
echoed by a sudden blast of 
sound from the bathroom. 

“You see,” Wickes yelled above 
the maddening cacophony, “the 



94 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



bomb is in constant communica- 
tion with its makers. It uses the 
radio waves that are absorbed in 
this dead space. That’s why you 
can’t get reception in this area. A 
natural consequence of the proba- 
bility nexus in the bathroom is to 
shunt all radiation into the uni- 
verse from which the bomb 
comes.” 

“Yes, but 

“So we feed it random radio 
impulses — my bassoon solo com- 
posed from a table of random 
numbers. It can’t code a random 
sequence. Ergo, it can’t communi- 
cate.” 

At this point, the bomb made 
a loud groaning noise. 

“Now!” Wickes cried with a 
wild gleam in his eyes. He 
charged for the bathroom, a rolled 
newspaper outthrust before him 
like a lance. 

' I 'HE bomb lay in the bathtub, 
moaning softly. Coleman 
halted behind Wickes as he held 
up the newspaper and began to 
read. 

“‘Father Slays Family of 
Five,’” Wickes intoned. 

The quivering bomb screamed 
piercingly. 

‘“Thousands Die in Wake of 
Eruption,’” he read. 

“Lies, lies, lies, lies!” 

“‘Indian Plague Takes Million 
Lives.’ ” 

The bomb began to howl, its 



voice rising to an ear-splitting 
pitch. 

“Here! You stop that!” 

Wickes turned to the gleaming 
machine that occupied the space 
where one wall of the bathroom 
had been. 

“I said stop that,” the dark lit- 
tle man in the machine said. 

“It’s him, it’s him,” Coleman 
bleated. “The man I told you 
about when I came to your office.” 

“Interesting,” Wickes said. He 
pointed toward the machine’s 
lower quarter, where a small me- 
tallic sign glowed. The sign said: 
“Paranoids Anonymous. ‘You, too, 
can destroy a universe.’ ” 

“Stop it, I say!” the little man 
yelled, waving what was obvi- 
ously a weapon. 

“Turn off the tape recorder,” 
Wickes told Coleman. 

Coleman headed toward the 
living room. 

“What’s the big idea?” the man 
demanded as he descended from 
the machine. His swarthy face 
was stormy under thick brows. He 
was dressed in a pair of shorts 
and singlet tailored from some 
metallic material. Calf - length 
boots encased his feet. A harness 
of some type encircled his waist 
and shoulders, and from this har- 
ness, various unknown pieces of 
apparatus dangled. 

“This is the best of all possible 
worlds,” the bomb said with the 
suspicion of a sniffle.

“Of course it is,” the man said 
soothingly. “Don’t you let anyone 
tell you it isn’t.” 

“Any odds it isn’t?” Wickes of- 
fered. 

“Huh!” the man said. But he 
looked interested. 

“Afraid of losing your — ah — 
shirt?” Wickes demanded. 

“Won’t do you any good,” the 
man said darkly. “Got to destroy 
a universe. The best one. This 
is it.” 

A small box that depended 
from the harness buzzed softly. 
The man removed it, pressed it to 
his lips and spoke a few incom- 
prehensible words. 

“Look,” Wickes said, “this has 
to be the best of all possible uni- 
verses, doesn’t it?” 

“It is,” the man said smugly. 
“They planned it that way.” 
“They?” 

“My psychometricians. It 
wouldn’t do to destroy just any 
universe. It has to be the best.” 

“I must say you’re remarkably 
objective about it.” 

“Why not? It’s my neurosis, 
isn’t it?” 

“Maybe this isn’t the best of 
all possible worlds.” 

“Ridiculous,” mumbled the 
bomb from the bathtub. 

“Best for whom?” Wickes de- 
manded. “By whose standards? 
Yours?” 

“Naturally.” 

“Want to bet?” 



The man licked his lips. “No- 
body ever accused me of being a 
con.” 

“If it’s the best possible world 
for you,” Wickes said, “you should 
win.” 

“True, true,” said the bomb. 

C OLEMAN had returned to the 
room. He was eying the dark 
man with something akin to hor- 
ror. 

“The dice, please,” Wickes said 
to Coleman. 

“What’s the idea?” the man de- 
manded. 

“I’ll prove my point.” 

The dark man smiled shrewdly. 
“There’s something you should 
know.” 

“Never mind.” 

“Don’t say I didn’t try to warn 
you.” 

“Let’s make this interesting,” 
Wickes said. “A little side bet?” 
“Done.” The man pulled filmy 
currency from one pocket. 

“I can’t spend your money,” 
Wickes pointed out. 

“You can’t win anyway.” 

“How about something more 
tangible?” Wickes asked. “One of 
those gadgets, for instance.” He 
pointed to the harness. 

“Roll them from the wall,” the 
man said, extracting one of the 
instruments. 

Wickes sank to one knee and 
rolled the dice. They came up 
double fours. 



96 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Hah!” Wickes said. 

He rolled three more times. On 
the fourth roll, the dice came up 
six and two. 

Half an hour later, Wickes had 
stripped the visitor to his shorts. 

The man jumped angrily to his 
feet. “You switched dice!” 

“Prove it.” 

“I quit.” 

“Coward! I mean con!” 

“That does it. You!” the man 
yelled at the bomb. “Forget about 
Tuesday! Detonate in one hour!” 
Then he leaped into the ma- 
chine and it flickered from view. 

“Now you’ve done it,” Coleman 
moaned. 

“Today is the finest day of all,” 
the bomb said. 

“Hm-m-m,” Wickes mused, in- 
specting the pile of loot at his 
feet. Finally he selected the box- 
like communicator that the man 
had used and inspected it closely. 

Coleman sank to the floor and 
began to roll the abandoned dice 
dispiritedly. After a moment, he 
picked them up and examined 
them closely. 

“Hey!” he exclaimed. “These 
dice don’t have any ones, threes 
or fives!” 

“That’s right,” Wickes said. 
“Then how can you throw 
sevens?” 

“You can’t.” 

“But that’s dishonest.” 

“Why? He was trying to cheat 
me.” 

THE BOMB IN THE BATHTUB 



A S COLEMAN pondered the 
question, Wickes began to 
speak earnestly into the commu- 
nicator. Before long, he seemed 
satisfied. 

“Well, now,” he said, “let’s re- 
lax. Can you make some coffee?” 
“That thing is ready to go off 
in an hour,” Coleman protested. 
“Do something!” 

“Patience, patience. All that 
can be done has been done.” 

He walked down the hall to 
the living room, Coleman trailing 
him dejectedly. 

“At least call the bomb squad,” 
Coleman said. 

“Hardly necessary.” 

“You blasted crackpot!” 
“There’s no need to be abu- 
sive,” Wickes said. “If you’ll only 
apply logic, you’ll see that certain 
features of this other universe 
may be — ” 

“Peace, my children,” said a 
voice from the bathroom. 

Standing in the doorway was 
the majestic figure of a man. He 
was tall and very fair, with a light 
crown of blond hair. His eyes 
were expressive and ethereal. 

“Well,” Wickes said, “you cer- 
tainly didn’t waste time.” 

“I am always ready for a suf- 
fering universe,” the man said, 
lifting his eyes unto the ceiling. 

“It’s in the bathroom,” Wickes 
said. 

“I have already taken care of 
it,” the man replied, “while you 

97 



two were having your childish 
tiff.” 

“Childish!” Coleman cried. “If 
you think—” 

“Peace, brotherhood,” the man 
said. “We must all live in perfect 
love.” 

He turned and walked back to- 
ward the bathroom. 

“Wait,” Wickes called and hur- 
ried after him. Coleman followed 
awkwardly, his eyes wide and un- 
believing. In the bathroom, the 
tub was quite empty. 

“Love is all-powerful,” the saint- 
like man said. For the first time, 
Wickes noticed the faint halo 
flickering above his head. 

The man began to mount a ma- 
chine in the wall. 

“Alas,” he sighed, “other worlds, 
other needs. Busy, busy.” 

Before the machine flickered 
from sight, Wickes saw the flick- 
ering metal sign on the machine. 

It said: “Messiahs, Incorpo- 
rated. ‘You, too, can save a uni- 
verse.’ ” 

T ATER, in the living room, 
Coleman sprawled limply on 
the divan while Wickes leaned on 
the mantel and stared dreamily 
into the dead fireplace, sucking on 
his unlit pipe. 

“I can see how you cut off the 
bomb’s communication,” Coleman 
said, “but why the newspapers?” 

“Well,” Wickes explained, “it 
wouldn’t have done our paranoid 

98 



friend to destroy just any uni- 
verse. It couldn’t be one that was 
better off obliterated or there 
would be no point to the therapy. 
Hence Dostoievsky and the news- 
papers. I had to demonstrate the 
world was better off destroyed. 
That’s the only way I could pry 
the paranoid from his vantage 
point in his world. Destroy the 
bomb’s conviction that this was 
the best universe, but prevent the 
bomb’s getting the complete story 
back to him.” 

“But that rigged crap game?” 
“Well, it was obvious that they 
set great store by gambling. More- 
over, I was certain the box he 
used kept him in contact with his 
world. I had only to win the com- 
municator. All else followed.” 

“By internal logic?” 

“Of course.” 

“Like Venusians in washing 
machines.” 

“Naturally.” 

“Forgive me for being stupid,” 
Coleman said ironically. 

“You’re just not used to think- 
ing in these terms,” Wickes said. 
“Surely it must be obvious that 
if there is an organization that 
aids paranoids by allowing them 
to destroy a universe, there must 
be some counter-organization for 
those poor fellows who want to 
save a universe.” 

“Messiahs, Incorporated?” 
“Exactly. The internal logic of 
the situation demanded it. I had 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



only to contact them. The job was 
made to order — a universe that 
needed saving.” 

Coleman struggled to his feet. 
“I think I need an aspirin,” he 
said weakly. He stumbled down 
the hall to the bathroom. 

Wickes heard his sudden cry of 
alarm. He ran toward the bath- 
room. Coleman had collapsed into 
the bathtub. 

The little man in the scarlet- 
edged toga was waving a dagger 
wildly. He stopped when he saw 
Wickes and smiled apologetically. 

“Oh, my,” he said. “You aren’t 



Julius Caesar, are you?” 

He moved swiftly toward his 
machine in the wall. 

Before it disappeared, Wickes 
managed to decipher the flicker- 
ing sign on its frame. 

It read: “Hindsight, Unlimited. 
‘You, too, can change a uni- 
verse.’ ” 

Wickes clasped his hands to- 
gether ecstatically. 

“Lovely,” he murmured. “Sim- 
ply lovely.” 

In the bathtub, Coleman only 
whimpered.

THE BOMB IN THE BATHTUB 




for your information 




By WILLY LEY 

BETWEEN US AND 
SPACE TRAVEL 

O NE of the questions which 
most frequently crops up 
in my mail may be 
worded about as follows: “Just 
what is it that stands between us 
and space travel?” The general 
impression seems to be that there 
is something specific which either 
stands in the way or is still miss- 
ing. 

To give a few examples: 

One reader was convinced that 
the solution to the whole problem 
hinged on the discovery or syn- 



100 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





thesis of “a metal which will not 
melt.” Other guesses ranged from 
“the need for the application of 
atomic energy” via “lack of 
money” to “the need for volun- 
teers.” One reader wondered 
whether we might not just be 
holding back for fear of interna- 
tional complications. 

The prize letter (written with 
pencil on yellow foolscap — that 
kind of letter usually is) was one 
advising me to drop the subject of 
space travel once and for all, be- 
cause it would not happen for a 
long time to come, if ever. He also 
knew the reason: Our govern- 
ment had signed a treaty with the 
flying saucer people to the effect 
that they would cease kidnaping 
humans for vivisection if we 
stopped trying to reach space! 

After you have caught your 
breath, we can proceed to take a 
careful look at the situation. To 
make a one-sentence answer, one 
may say that the same thing 
stands between us and space 
travel which prevented Mr. Don- 
ald Douglas from building his 
DC-7 in 1933. It is all the work 
that still needs to be done. 

A SIDE from that, there isn’t 
anything specific to point to. 
A new and more powerful fuel, 
one which contains more energy 
per pound of weight, would cer- 
tainly be a help and would be 
welcomed by everybody con- 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



cemed. But the discovery of such 
a fuel is not a necessary prelim- 
inary. 

After all, Dr. Wemher von 
Braun has shown in various pub- 
lications that the manned space 
station, the trip around the Moon, 
the trip to the Moon with landing, 
and even a trip to Mars could be 
accomplished using hydrazine 
and nitric acid for fuels. 

It would be a gigantic under- 
taking to do it with these fuels, 
but it is possible. Fuel, therefore, 
is not the problem. 

As regards a new alloy, one 
which would have a better 
strength/weight ratio, the story is 
about the same. If somebody suc- 
ceeded in producing an alloy 
somewhat stronger than steel but 
a little lighter than aluminum, 
everybody would be happy, of 
course. But the realization of 
space travel does not hinge on 
such a discovery. 

To repeat: the whole “art” has 
to progress for a number of more 
years to find answers to innumer- 
able detail problems; at one point 
or another, you may need a new 
type of thermostat or something 
like that — something that nobody 
doubts can be done, but which for 
some reason had not been done 
before — and which might prove 
time-consuming. 

But if you insist on the naming 
of a few specific problems that 
are known but unsolved at the 

101 



present moment, three could be 
picked out. One is mechanical 
and in the realm of physics. The 
other two are physiological and in 
the realm of medicine. 

They are: 

(a) the re-entry problem 

(b) physiological effects of 
cosmic rays 

(c) the effect of zero gravity 

The re-entry problem is pre- 
cisely what its name indicates: 
the problem of re-entering the at- 
mosphere. A rocket which leaves 
the atmosphere has all the natu- 
ral laws working in its favor. Its 
velocity increases as it climbs, but 
all the time it is traversing more 
and more rarefied layers of the 
atmosphere. If the rocket does 
heat up because of air friction, it 
will be so little that nobody has 
to worry about it and no special 
measures need to be taken. 

But on re-entry, the situation is 
reversed. The rocket enters with 
a high velocity and the Earth’s 
gravitational attraction increases 
it some more. Simultaneously, the 
air grows denser and denser and 
enormous frictional heating is 
bound to occur. 

It is rather safe to say that the 
re-entry problem is not solved at 
this moment. But engineers feel 
sure that they can solve it, pro- 
vided they have exact and reli- 
able figures to work with. The 
artificial satellites will provide 
these figures. 

102 



T N THE case of the cosmic rays, 

a good deal has already been 
learned, but not enough by far to 
have a basis for an answer which 
can be expected to be correct, or 
at least very nearly so. 

The experiments carried out by 
Dr. Van Allan in the vicinity of 
the northern magnetic pole for 
the first time gave figures for the 
number of cosmic rays in the up- 
per layers of the atmosphere. 
These figures were such that an 
exposure of a few days or even a 
few weeks did not look danger- 
ous, even though they had to be 
multiplied by two. (The measure- 
ments were taken in the upper 
atmosphere, which means, of 
course, that about half of all cos- 
mic rays were absorbed by the 
bulk of the Earth below. For open 
space, with no shielding planet 
nearby, there should be about 
twice as many.) The artificial 
satellites will either confirm or 
correct the results of these earlier 
measurements. 

At any event, the cosmic ray 
“danger” looks more like a buga- 
boo at the moment, only we don’t 
yet dare say so. Besides, there 
still exists the additional possi- 
bility that medical science might 
discover a way of healing quickly 
whatever damage may have been 
done. 

The last point, the effect of 
zero-g, is even harder to evalu- 
ate properly. The opposite of 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



zero -g, namely the multiple g of 
acceleration during takeoff, can 
be duplicated in the laboratory 
by means of large centrifuges. So 
this could be investigated and 
tested and was found not to har- 
bor any insurmountable difficul- 
ties. 

But zero-g, the complete ab- 
sence of any gravitational strain, 
cannot be produced easily near 
the ground. You can imitate it by 
way of the so-called parabolic 
flight of a fast airplane with its 
engine shut off the instant it en- 
ters this flight curve. But it lasts 
for half a minute at the most, and 
that is not enough to draw any 
really valid conclusions. 

The customary thing to say is 
that zero-g must feel like a never- 
ending fall. Assuming that it does, 
this still leaves one very impor- 
tant question open. As the state- 
ment is usually made, it contains 
the hidden assumption that the 
body will not be able to get used 
to it. But maybe the body will. 
Just as you tend to disregard a 
steady noise after some time, that 
feeling of falling may “disappear” 
after three or four or ten minutes. 

One may also ask whether it 
actually will feel like falling. We 
don’t have too much experience 
even in that. But what experience 
there is is always contaminated 
by extraneous sensations. The 
man who jumps from a high div- 
ing board sees things rush by and 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



up at him. The man who makes a 
delayed parachute jump feels the 
air tearing his suit and whistling 
and may fall through clouds. But 
how does falling feel when all 
these other sensations are miss- 
ing? Does it still feel like falling? 

The answer is that we don’t 
know yet. 

But we’ll find out. And when 
that has been done, another bar- 
rier between us and space travel 
will have been removed. 

DURABLE FORGERY 

A FEW months after the skull 
of Eoanthropus dawsoni, bet- 
ter known to many people as the 
Piltdown skull, had been exposed 
as a forgery by British scientists, 
I had some correspondence with 
a reader who apparently took this 
quite to heart. At least, he wrote, 
this must have been the most suc- 
cessful forgery in the sense that 
it had fooled the largest number 
of people and had lasted for a 
very long time until exposed. 

I replied that it certainly had 
lasted a long time — the “discov- 
ery” was announced on December 
18, 1912, the expose on Novem- 
ber 21, 1953, giving it a lifetime 
of 41 years — but I suspected that 
other forgeries had lasted longer. 
As for the number of people 
taken in by it, I pointed out that 
the scientists of continental 
Europe had never completely ac- 

103 



cepted Piltdown man and their 
mentions of it were usually accom- 
panied by qualifications like “still 
needing investigation” or words to 
that effect. 

I received a reply which said, 
“Well, if you don’t think that Pilt- 
down was the most successful 
forgery, which one was?” 

Without much hesitation, I 
stated, “Of those I know about, I 
would say the Koniginhofer Man- 
uscript.” 

Back came the query: “What is 
the Koniginhofer Manuscript?” 
This was one of those short ques- 
tions which require a long answer. 
I promised to let him know in 
print. And here is the story. 

The name of the case is, as has 
been mentioned, the “Konigin- 
hofer Manuscript.” This is the 
German name. The Czech name 
is “Kralovedvorsky Rukopis.” 
Both versions mean the same 
thing and the reference in both is 
to a place name, that of a small 
town, about a hundred miles from 
Prague at the Elbe River, which 
is called Dvur Kralove in Czech 
and Koniginhof in German. The 
English translation of either name 
is “Court of the Queen” because 
the town’s founder, King Wences- 
las II of Bohemia, had given it to 
his wife Elizabeth. Since Wences- 
las II died in 1305, it is an old 
town, but it never grew to be a 
large one — only within the cur- 
rent century did its population 

104 



manage to pass the 15,000 mark. 

Local historians stated that 
Dvur Kralove or Koniginhof had 
suffered in some wars of the past. 
But they had to admit that it had 
never been important and that, 
outside of Bohemia, it was prob- 
ably unknown. 

TT WAS in 1817 that a young 

man by the name of Vaclav 
Hanka found an old manuscript 
somewhere in the steeple of the 
church of Koniginhof. Hanka, 
who later became librarian of the 
Bohemian Museum, told inter- 
ested people that he had thought 
at first that he had found a Latin 
chronicle written on vellum. He 
said that he put it aside to finish 
whatever it was he had been do- 
ing when he came across the 
manuscript. 

An hour or two later, when he 
was finished, he looked at it again 
and saw to his surprise that the 
language was not Latin at all but 
ancient Bohemian. Looking 
through it some more, he noticed 
that it was poetry and not really 
a “manuscript” as the word is now 
used, but a “fair copy.” It had 
been written, or copied, by a very 
careful hand, using inks in various 
colors. I have seen colored repro- 
ductions of a number of pages. 
They look as if they were en- 
graved; they are far too beautiful 
to look either printed or written. 

Vaclav Hanka took the manu- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



script to Professor Josef Dobrov- 
sky in Prague, who was considered 
to be the greatest living authority 
on Czech and related languages. 
After going through it carefully, 
Professor Dobrovsky saw to it 
that it was published. Apparently 
the Czech language had under- 
gone considerable changes since 
the thirteenth century, the alleged 
date of the manuscript, for the 
first printed edition is accom- 
panied by a translation into mod- 
ern Czech. 

The thought that the manu- 
script might not be genuine does 
not seem to have occurred to Pro- 
fessor Dobrovsky. The vellum 
was old and so was the language. 
And the story of the discovery 
sounded convincing — a church 
steeple would be just the place 
where a manuscript might be first 
hidden and then overlooked 
through centuries. 

A year or two after the Czech 
version, a German translation was 
published. In the course of the 
years, other translations were 
made. There was one into French 
and another into Russian. Then 
came a revised and improved 
German edition. Finally, in 1852, 
there appeared a volume entitled 
“Polyglotta Kralovedvorskeho ru- 
kopisu,” a collection of transla- 
tions into most modern languages. 

So far, nobody had any doubts. 
Old Professor Dobrovsky, who 
had died in 1829, had accepted 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



it and the other outstanding lan- 
guage experts of the time, like 
Professors Palacky, Jungmann 
and Safarik, also thought it was 
genuine. And it was known espe- 
cially of Professor Dobrovsky 
that he was highly critical. About 
a year after the Koniginhofer 
Manuscript became known, his- 
tory seemed to repeat itself. One 
Josef Kovar, paymaster of the 
estate of Griinberg, had found an- 
other old manuscript which was 
dubbed the Griinberger Manu- 
script. It was much shorter than 
the find from Dvur Kralove, con- 
sisting of just two poetic frag- 
ments, the end of one poem and 
the beginning of another one. But 
it was much older, dating all the 
way back to the eighth century! 

OROFESSOR DOBROVSKY 
only saw a copy of these 
poems made by somebody and at 
once declared that the Griin- 
berger Manuscript was a forgery. 
In a letter to an English colleague, 
he mentioned the Griinberger 
Manuscript and called it deplor- 
able that some young men tried 
to foist such fakes upon the world 
of letters: “Not being satisfied 
with the Koniginhofer Manu- 
script from the thirteenth cen- 
tury, they manufacture others 
said to be older so as to outdate 
the older folk songs of the Ger- 
mans and others . .” 

In 1858, there began faint 

105 



rumblings in the form of a num- 
ber of anonymous articles in a 
German - language newspaper in 
Bohemia, which doubted that the 
manuscript was as old as it was 
said to be. It is doubtful whether 
many people paid attention to 
these articles. To begin with, they 
were anonymous. Secondly, they 
appeared in a daily newspaper, 
not in a learned journal or a liter- 
ary magazine. Finally, the Ger- 
mans and Czechs in Bohemia 
were in each other’s hair all the 
time, so that a German attack on 
a Czech manuscript could be dis- 
counted for that reason alone. 

T HAT the historian professor 
Biidinger in Vienna openly 
doubted the genuineness of the 
manuscript and the story of its 
“discovery” was more serious. 
That was in 1859. 

Then Professor Julius Fejfalik 
of Prague went to work on the 
problem of the historicity of the 
manuscript and came up with an 
almost devastating case. The vel- 
lum was old, he wrote, but the ink 
seemed to be much more recent 
than the vellum. As for the shape 
of the letters, they were very 
nearly — but only very nearly — 
what one could expect of a scribe 
of the thirteenth century. Besides, 
they were much too careful — 
they looked as if they had been 
drawn one by one, rather than 
written. 

KM 



A point which Professor Fej- 
falik stressed at great length was 
that the poems occasionally 
showed an anti-German attitude. 
As a person, Professor Fejfalik 
may very well have been anti- 
German himself, but as a histo- 
rian, he knew that the German- 
Czech animosities which pervaded 
daily life in Prague were com- 
paratively recent; the two nations 
had hardly been in touch with 
each other at the time of the al- 
leged origin of the poems. 

Moreover, they were supposed 
to be folk songs and there some- 
thing else came in. Wrote Fej- 
falik : “A hero was either a 
friendly hero or an enemy hero, 
but the people cared only whether 
he was friend or enemy and did 
not think in terms of nationali- 
ties.” 

There was one poem that Fej- 
falik pounced on especially. It 
was a song of a peasant girl, com- 
plaining that her lover had been 
“led away” (presumably drafted 
into somebody’s army) and that 
she would write him a love letter 
if only she had parchment and 
some ink and a quill! A letter- 
writing Bohemian peasant girl in 
the thirteenth century was too 
much for Professor Fejfalik’s 
credulity. 

After that treatise had been 
published, most historians were 
ready to call the manuscript a 
fraud. But what could have been 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a simple expose of an admittedly 
skillful forgery developed into an 
issue involving national honor. 

Two Czechs, the brothers Jire- 
cek, violently attacked Professor 
Fejfalik, who could no longer an- 
swer, since he had died in 1862. 
Professor Johannes Gebauer of 
the University of Prague, the out- 
standing expert on Slavonic lan- 
guages of the time, continued 
where Fejfalik had left off. He 
did not say outright that the 
manuscript was not genuine, but 
he cited reasons for doubting its 
genuineness— whereupon his older 
colleague Martin Hattala called 
him a traitor. 

T» ETWEEN 1870 and 1880, the 
line of discussion was as 
clear-cut as it was silly. If you 
spoke of the manuscript as hav- 
ing been found in Dvur Kralove, 
you automatically asserted that 
it must be genuine. If you said it 
had been discovered in Konigin- 
hof, you were convinced that it 
was a forgery. 

In 1886, a still comparatively 
young (36 years) Czech patriot 
stepped in. His name was Tomas 
Garrigue Masaryk, the man who 
from 1918 until 1935 served his 
country as first president of the 
Czechoslovak Republic. 

“The manner of controversy 
cannot possibly be reconciled 
with honor and truthfulness,” he 
declared, and went on to say: “I 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



fail to understand how anybody 
could say that the defense of the 
genuineness of the manuscript is 
a question of national prestige 
and national honor. National 
honor demands the defense and/ 
or the finding of the truth and it 
certainly needs more courage to 
admit an error than to defend 
one, even if it is deep-rooted in 
a whole nation.” 

One might say that the men 
who really proved that the manu- 
script was a forgery were the his- 
torian Goll and the philologist 
Gebauer. But without Masaryk’s 
aid, hardly anybody would have 
heard their voices. Gebauer could 
shbw that the poems were not 
folk songs but were poems in folk 
style written by one man. The 
grammar was not the Czech of 
the thirteenth century, but what 
thirteenth-century Czech was 
thought to have been in 1815. 

During ( the seventy years that 
had gone by since then, philolo- 
gists had learned quite a number 
of facts not known in Dobrovsky’s 
time. 

Professor Goll took the his- 
torical hints in the poems and 
showed conclusively that they did 
not agree with actual history. 
Masaryk directed his own criti- 
cism at the sociological implica- 
tions and declared that these 
alone were grounds for suspicion. 
He summed up by saying that 
one would have to “sacrifice the 

107 



results of all the sciences plus 
logic” to accept the manuscript as 
genuine. 

By 1895, the question was set- 
tled. But neither Masaryk nor 
anybody else could ever prove 
who had actually written the 
poems. The chief suspect is the 
“discoverer” of the manuscript, 
Vaclav Hanka. As has been men- 
tioned, the language of the manu- 
script is not what it actually was 
during the thirteenth century, but 
what philologists of about 1815 
thought it had been. And Hanka, 
a few years before he made his 
“discovery,” had published a book 
on old Bohemian, containing just 
these mistakes. Still, that does not 
prove that he wrote the poems, 
for others of the same time made 
the same mistakes. 

The Koniginhofer Manuscript, 
then, was a forgery with a lifetime 
of about seventy years, nearly 
thirty years longer than that of 
the Piltdown forgery. And I could 
claim a lifetime of nearly a full 
century if I wanted to include one 
diehard named Martin Zunkovic. 
He published a book still defend- 
ing the manuscript in 1912. His 
main reason for defending it was 
that the doubters had based their 
criticism on printed editions with- 
out working from the original. 

As if this argument were not 
weird enough, Zunkovic admitted 
in his book that he had not seen 
the original, either!

OUR CAPSIZING EARTH 

T> ECOUNTING the longevity 
of the fraud of the manu- 
script of Koniginhof made me 
think of another story which has 
been around, on and off, for 
nearly a century now. It is a bit 
hard to pin a label on it, for it 
does not really fit into any cate- 
gory. It is, to begin with, not a 
hoax, even though it is completely 
without foundation. It is not 
really fiction, though it comes 
close to it in content, but not in 
intent. And it certainly isn’t sci- 
ence, though it claims to be. 

The story is that Earth is bound 
to capsize within a not too dis- 
tant future, say a few thousand 
years. 

But let us begin with the ac- 
tual scientific facts. The orbit of 
Earth around the Sun is an ellipse 
which is so nearly circular that 
no drawing made on a piece of 
paper small enough to be handled 
conveniently can show the differ- 
ence. But in reality the difference 
— meaning the actual distance be- 
tween the Sun and the Earth — 
amounts to three million miles. 

The Earth, when passing 
through the perihelion (the point 
of its orbit closest to the Sun) is 
a full three million miles closer to 
it than when passing through 
aphelion — the point of its orbit 
farthest from the Sun. In the 
course of one year, the Earth, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



naturally, passes through both 
these points, through perihelion 
early in January and through 
aphelion early in July. 

The interesting point is, of 
course, that we on the northern 
hemisphere are experiencing heat 
waves just when our planet is 
farthest from the Sun and freeze 
when it is closest. It merely 
proves that the tilt of the Earth’s 
axis is far more important cli- 
matically than this comparatively 
minor difference in the distance 
from the Sun. 

To the inhabitants of the south- 
ern hemisphere, especially Aus- 
tralia, things are reversed: They 
do have summer when closest to 
the Sun and winter when farthest 
from it. But like our northern 
summers and winters, the season 
is caused by the tilt of the Earth’s 
axis; it just happens to look more 
“reasonable.” 

There is one additional factor 
that should be mentioned. The 
Earth, like any other planet, 
moves a bit faster in its orbit 
when near perihelion and some- 
what more slowly when at aphe- 
lion. 

Consequently the summer of 
the northern hemisphere is ex- 
tended a little and the winter 
shortened by an equal amount. 

r T , HUS far, everything that has 
been said is definitely estab- 
lished. Now we enter the realm 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



of conclusions which are not com- 
pletely certain. 

The southern summer is shorter 
and should be somewhat hotter 
than the summer of a correspond- 
ing spot on the northern hemi- 
sphere. Consequently the south- 
ern winter must last a little longer 
and should be colder. There are 
some statistics which claim that 
this is actually so, but not every- 
body believes them, for the 
weather in a specific place is usu- 
ally influenced by local factors. 

But discounting local factors — 
which is something one mustn’t 
do — the southern hemisphere 
should accumulate ice under the 
present state of astronomical af- 
fairs. One theory holds that even 
though the southern summers are 
hotter, they cannot take care of 
all the ice which accumulated 
during the longer and colder win- 
ter. Hence ice will accumulate 
through the millenia — and every- 
body knows that the southern ice 
cap of our planet is larger and 
thicker than the northern one. 

But we are not completely 
done with the astronomical facts 
yet. Although the axis of rotation 
of our planet is always tilted by 
about 66 V 2 ° to the ecliptic (or 
23 V 2 0 from a line vertical to the 
ecliptic), it does not always point 
at the same point in the sky. 
Right now, it points almost di- 
rectly at the star Polaris, but 
6000 years from now, it won’t 

109 



any more. The result of this “pre- 
cession” is that, in the course of 
the millenia, the situation will 
shift. In time, the northern hemi- 
sphere will have summer when 
the Earth goes through perihelion 
and will have winter when the 
Earth passes aphelion. 

If the reasoning quoted before 
is correct, ice will then accumu- 
late at the northern pole and the 
ice cap of the southern pole will 
be the smaller one. 

To forestall any possible mis- 
understanding or confusion, I 
wish to repeat once more that all 
this is established astronomical 
knowledge. The only uncertain 
point is whether the larger ice cap 
of the southern pole is solely due 
to the southern “aphelion winter” 
or whether it is mostly due to the 
fact that the South Pole area hap- 
pens to be high land (under the 
ice) while the North Pole is at 
sea level. It may be this elevation 
of the south polar area which 
really makes the difference. 

Natural philosophy and, with 
it, a charming kind of fantasy 
entered the field in 1842. In that 
year, Monsieur Alphonse Joseph 
Adhemar, teacher of mathematics 
in Paris and author of a few ma- 
thematical textbooks, published a 
work which explained all these 
facts to the readers and then pro- 
ceeded to solve a few mysteries. 

The hemisphere which happens 
to have “aphelion winter” does 

no 



form a larger ice cap, the profes- 
sor asserted. And because it is so 
large and massive, it slightly 
shifts the center of gravity of the 
whole planet, with the result that 
the waters of the oceans have a 
tendency to assemble in that 
hemisphere. 

J UST look at a globe, Adhemar 
advised, and you’ll see how far 
land extends in the north. But in 
the south, there is a wide rim of 
ocean around the ice cap, the di- 
rect result of its weight. (If Adhe- 
mar were right, all this should be 
drowned land, which implies a 
comparatively shallow sea. In 
reality, it is deep ocean, but that 
was not known in his time.) Now, 
he continued, as things go on and 
the earth’s axis slowly points in 
the direction of other stars, the 
north is going to get the colder 
winters. Ice will accumulate 
around the North Pole and the 
southern ice will diminish. 

And then, one day, the north- 
ern ice will be stronger. The last 
southern iceberg will melt in the 
warming seas. The center of grav- 
ity of the Earth will shift along 
the Earth’s axis in a northerly di- 
rection and the waters of the 
oceans will rush to the north with 
dramatic suddenness, drowning 
the land areas around the North 
Pole which are now dry, even if 
cold. 

Then he drew some additional 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



conclusions. The last shift must 
have been from north to south — 
this is indubitably the event re- 
ported in the Bible as the Flood. 
The shift before that must have 
been from south to north — this 
scooped up elephants in Africa 
and transported them to Siberia. 
(This was written before com- 
plete bodies of the Siberian mam- 
moth had been secured and exam- 
ined. Adhemar could not know 
how well adapted the mammoth 
had been to a cold climate.) 

We can leave Monsieur Adhe- 
mar alone now; he had to be 
quoted mainly to show where the 
later elaboration of his thought 
originated. The later elaboration, 
which, as I have mentioned, has 
cropped up at reasonably regular 
intervals ever since, adds one 
more touch. It is not just a ques- 
tion of a minor shift of the center 
of gravity which makes the waters 
rush from one pole to the other. 
It is, instead, a capsizing of the 
planet as a whole, in which the 
two poles chance place! 

Just why the Earth should cap- 
size has never been explained by 
any of the many who advanced 
this as a brand-new and original 
idea. The Earth is, after all, not a 
ball floating on the surface of 
some liquid, but a massive body 
moving in the gravitational field 
of the Sun, which is another story 
entirely. If a very large mass 
could accumulate somewhere near 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



the equator of the Earth, it would 
affect the rotation. But a large 
mass centered on one of the poles 
of rotation couldn’t possibly have 
such an effect. 

In order to pursue the case to 
the bitter end, let us see just how 
large a mass could accumulate. 
Obviously the worst that could 
possibly happen is that all the 
water of our planet freezes around 
one pole. It isn’t at all difficult to 
calculate how much that would 
be. 

A CCORDING to the Smith- 
sonian Physical Tables, the 
total land surface of Earth is 
153,500,000 square kilometers. 
The water surface is more than 
twice that large, namely 365,- 
500,000 square kilometers. The 
average depth of the oceans is 
12,450 feet, which equals 3,795 
meters. Multiplying the water 
area by the average depth, you 
get 1,388,900,000 cubic kilo- 
meters — rounded off, 1,390 mil- 
lion cubic kilometers. 

Since one cubic kilometer of 
water weighs 1,000 million metric 
tons (or 1,102 million short tons), 
the total weight of the oceans 
must be 1,390,000,000,000,000,- 
000 metric tons, which can be 
expressed better in the space-sav- 
ing manner of the mathematician 
by writing 1.4 x 10 18 metric tons. 
(Or 1.5 x 10 18 short tons.) This is 
the maximum that possibly could 

ill 



accumulate at a pole, simply be- 
cause that is all the water there 
is on our planet. 

It is no doubt a very impres- 
sive figure, but it is not the whole 
story. We must compare the 
weight of the water with the 
weight of the Earth as a whole. 

The mass of the Earth as a 
whole is: 

5.983 x 10 21 metric tons 
or 

6.595 x 10 21 short tons 
As one can easily see, this makes 
the ratio of all the water on Earth 
to the planet as a whole like 1400 



in 6,000,000 or, if you prefer 
smaller figures, like 1.4 in 6,000. 

In short, the weight of all the 
water on Earth is negligible in 
comparison with that of the Earth. 
Even if the Earth were like a ball 
floating on a liquid (which, of 
course, it is not), and if all the 
water could freeze near one pole, 
it would not make Earth capsize. 

We may be in for all kinds of 
natural calamities, plus all kinds 
of human foolishness — but the 
stability of the Earth is one thing 
we do not have to worry about.

But the trading in rubles goes 
merrily on — without the original 
salesmen being cut in. When 
Stalin died, the price shot up to 
more than the currency of some 
existing governments. 

Getting back to insurance for a 
moment, I’ve tried any number of 
times to turn this setup into a 
detective story: 

A worrywart takes out a huge 
policy insuring him against 
drowning in the Ganges River. He 
has never been out of the U.S. 
and doesn’t intend to, because of 
his fear that the Ganges will be 
the end of him. Without leaving 
New York City, he does drown 
in the Ganges! 

It actually could have hap- 
pened a generation or so ago. A 
remittance man, the younger son 
of a rajah, had a palatial home 
facing Central Park. Being a de- 
vout Hindu, he had enough 
Ganges water shipped to him to 
fill a fair-sized pool each year, 
and allowed visiting and expatri- 
ate countrymen to wash away 
their sins in the holy H 2 0. 

If our hypothetical victim had 
drowned in that pool, no insur- 
ance company could have argued 
against the invoices and shipping 
documents. Never worked out as 
a story, though — why would he 
take out the policy and how could 
the murderer get him to the pool 
believably? 



It’s commonly thought that 
only Man is advanced enough to 
be superstitious, but at least one 
case of animal superstition has 
been recorded. A grain truck in 
Manhattan overturned. Long after 
the grain was swept up, pigeons 
were observed doing exactly what 
they had done the moment of the 
accident, clearly hoping this had 
something to do with the miracu- 
lous windfall. 

I don’t know what to do with 
the Case of the Girl Whose Nose 
Lit Up During a Performance of 
Pagliacci. In the dark, she fum- 
bled in her purse for a benzedrine 
inhaler for her cold. What she 
came up with — and used — was a 
program flashlight. 

And there’s the establishment 
of the International Date Line in 
1879, the lifework of a Scandina- 
vian named Alex Andersrag. Nat- 
urally, it was known as Alex An- 
dersrag Time Band. 

That, in turn, leads to the bi- 
ology prof who prodded a frog 
and said, “Choomp!” and the frog 
obediently jumped. Then the pro- 
fessor cut off the legs and said, 
“Choomp!” and nothing happened. 
Turning to the class, the prof ex- 
plained, “You see? Vhen you cut 
off der legs, it interferes mit der 
hearing.” 

Thanks for letting me unload 
these mental fishhooks. Now 
they’re your problem.

according to the radio, was eighty-

my Greenwich Village thermome- 
ter, it was ninety-six. I got dressed 
and went into the living room, 
and wished ardently that my

wife Molly were here to tell me 
why the whole place looked so 
woebegone. 

What do they do, I asked my- 
self, that I have left undone? I’ve 
vacuumed the carpet, I’ve dusted 
and I’ve straightened the cushions 
. Ah! The ashtrays. I emptied 
them, washed them and put them 
back, but still the place looked 
wife-deserted. 

It had been a bad day; I had 
forgotten to wind the alarm clock, 
so I’d had to hurry to make a 
story conference at one of the TV 
studios I write for. I didn’t notice 
the impending rain storm and 
had no umbrella when I reached 
the sidewalk, to find myself con- 
fronted with an almost tropical 
downpour. I would have turned 
back, but a taxi came up and a 
woman got out, so I dashed 
through the rain and got in. 

“Madison and Fifty-fourth,” I 
said. 

“Right,” said the driver, and I 
heard the starter grind, and then 
go on grinding. After some futile 
efforts, he turned to me. “Sorry, 
Mac. You’ll have to find another 
cab. Good hunting.” 

If possible, it was raining still 
harder. I opened my newspaper 
over my hat and ran for the sub- 
way: three blocks. Whizzing 

traffic held me up at each crossing 
and I was soaked when I reached 
the platform, just in time to miss 
the local. After an abnormal de- 

116 



lay, I got one which exactly 
missed the express at Fourteenth 
Street. The same thing happened 
at both ends of the crosstown 
shuttle, but I found the rain had 
stopped when I got out at Fifty- 
first and Lexington. 

A S I walked across to Madison 

Avenue, I passed a big exca- 
vation where they were getting 
ready to put up a new office build- 
ing. There was the usual crowd 
of buffs watching the digging 
machines and, in particular, a 
man with a pneumatic drill who 
was breaking up some hard- 
packed clay. While I looked, a 
big lump of it fell away, and for 
an instant I was able to see some- 
thing that looked like a chunk of 
dirty glass, the size of an old- 
fashioned hatbox. It glittered bril- 
liantly in the sunlight, and then 
his chattering drill hit it. 

There was a faint bang and the 
thing disintegrated. It knocked 
him on his back, but he got right 
up and I realized he was not hurt 
At the moment of the explosion 
— if so feeble a thing can be 
called one — I felt something 
sting my face and, on touching it 
found blood on my hand. I 
mopped at it with my handker- 
chief but though slight, the bleed- 
ing would not stop, so I went into 
a drugstore and bought some pink 
adhesive which I put on the tiny 
cut. When I got to the studio, I 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



found that I had missed the story 
conference. 

During the day, by actual 
count, I heard the phrase “I’m 
just spitballing” eight times, and 
another Madison Avenue favorite, 
“The whole ball of wax,” twelve 
times. However, my story had 
been accepted without change be- 
cause nobody had noticed my ab- 
sence from the conference room. 
There you have what is known 
as the Advertising World, the Ad- 
vertising game or the advertising 
racket, depending upon which 
rung of the ladder you have 
achieved. 

The subway gave a repeat per- 
formance going home, and as I 
got to the apartment house we 
live in, the cop on the afternoon 
beat was standing there talking 
to the doorman. 

He said, “Hello, Mr. Graham. 
I guess you must have just have 
missed it at your office building.” 
I looked blank and he explained, 
“We just heard it a little while 
ago: all six elevators in your 
building jammed at the same 
time. Sounds crazy. I guess you 
just missed it.” 

Anything can happen in adver- 
tising, I thought. “That’s right, 
Danny, I just missed it,” I said, 
and went on in. 

Psychiatry tells us that some 
people are accident-prone; I, on 
the other hand, seemed recently 
to be coincidence-prone, fluke- 



happy, and except for the alarm 
clock, I’d had no control over 
what had been going on. 

I went into our little kitchen 
to make a drink and reread the 
directions Molly had left, telling 
me how to get along by myself 
until she got back from her 
mother’s in Oyster Bay, a matter 
of ten days. How to make coffee, 
how to open a can, whom to call 
if I took sick and such. My wife 
used to be a trained nurse and 
she is quite convinced that I can- 
not take a breath without her. 
She is right, but not for the rea- 
sons she supposes. 

I opened the refrigerator to get 
some ice and saw another notice: 
“When you take out the Milk or 
Butter, Put it Right Back. And 
Close the Door, too.” 

Intimidated, I took my drink 
into the living room and sat down 
in front of the typewriter. As I 
stared at the novel that was to 
liberate me from Madison Av- 
enue, I noticed a mistake and 
picked up a pencil. When I put 
it down, it rolled off the desk, 
and with my eyes on the manu- 
script, I groped under the chair 
for it. Then I looked down. The 
pencil was standing on its end. 

* I ''HERE, I thought to myself, 
is that one chance in a million 
we hear about, and picked up the 
pencil. I turned back to my novel 
and drank some of the highball

in hopes of inspiration and sur- 
cease from the muggy heat, but 
nothing came. I went back and 
read the whole chapter to try to 
get a forward momentum, but 
came to a dead stop at the last 
sentence. 

Damn the heat, damn the pen- 
cil, damn Madison Avenue and 
advertising. My drink was gone 
and I went back to the kitchen 
and read Molly’s notes again to 
see if they would be like a letter 
from her. I noticed one that I 
had missed, pinned to the door 
of the dumbwaiter: “Garbage 

picked up at 6:30 AM so the idea 
is to Put it Here the Night Before 
I love you.” What can you do 
when the girl loves you? 

I made another drink and went 
and stared out of the living room 
window at the roof opposite. The 
Sun was out again and a man 
with a stick was exercising his 
flock of pigeons. They wheeled 
in a circle, hoping to be allowed 
to perch, but were not allowed 
to. 

Pigeons fly as a rule in forma- 
tion and turn simultaneously, so 
that their wings all catch the sun- 
light at the same time. I was \ 
thinking about this decorative 
fact when I saw that as they were 
making a turn, they seemed to 
bunch up together. By some curi- 
ous chance, they all wanted the 
same place in the sky to turn in, 
and several collided and fell. 



The man was as surprised as 
I and went to one of the dazed 
birds and picked it up. He stood 
there shaking his head from side 
to side, stroking its feathers. 

My speculations about this pe- 
culiar aerial traffic accident were 
interrupted by loud voices in the 
hallway. Since our building is usu- 
ally very well behaved, I was 
astonished to hear what sounded 
like an incipient free-for-all, and 
among the angry voices I recog- 
nized that of my neighbor, Nat, 
a very quiet guy who works on 
a newspaper and has never, to 
my knowledge, given wild par- 
ties, particularly in the late after- 
noon. 

“You can’t say a thing like that 
to me!” I heard him shout. “I tell 
you I got that deck this afternoon 
and they weren’t opened till we 
started to play!” 

Several other loud voices 
started at the same time. 

“Nobody gets five straight- 
flushes in a row!” 

“Yeah, and only when you 
were dealer!” 

The tone of the argument was 
beginning to get ugly, and I 
opened the door to offer Nat help 
if he needed it. There were four 
men confronting him, evidently 
torn between the desire to make 
an angry exit and the impulse to 
stay and beat him up. His face 
was furiously red and he looked 
stunned.

“Here!” he said, holding out a 
deck of cards, “For Pete’s sake, 
look at ’em yourselves if you 
think they’re marked!” 

The nearest man struck them 
up from his hand. “Okay, Hou- 
dini! So they’re not marked! All 
I know is five straight . 

His voice trailed away. He and 
the others stared at the scattered 
cards on the floor. About half 
were face down, as might be ex- 
pected, and the rest face up — all 
red. 

S OMEONE must have rung, be- 
cause at that moment the ele- 
vator arrived and the four men, 
with half frightened, incredulous 
looks, and in silence, got in and 
were taken down. My friend 
stood looking at the neatly ar- 
ranged cards. 

“Judas!” he said, and started 
to pick them up. “Will you look 
at that! My God, what a ses- 
sion . .” 

I helped him and said to come 
in for a drink and tell me all 
about it, but I had an idea what 
I would hear. 

After a while, he calmed down, 
but he still seemed dazed. 

“Never seen anything to equal 
it,” he said. “Wouldn’t have be- 
lieved it. Those guys didn’t be- 
lieve it. Every round normal, 
nothing unusual about the hands 
— three of a kind, a low straight, 
that sort of thing and one guy 



got queens over tens, until it gets 
to be my deal. Brother! Straight 
flush to the king — every time! 
And each time, somebody else 
has four aces . .” 

He started to sweat again, so I 
got up to fix him another drink. 
There was one quart of club soda 
left, but when I tried to open it; 
the top broke and glass chips got 
into the bottle. 

“I’ll have to go down for more 
soda,” I said. 

“I’ll come, too. I need air.” 

At the delicatessen on the cor- 
ner, the man gave me three bot- 
tles in what must have been a 
wet bag, because as he handed 
them to me over the top of the 
cold-meat display, the bottom 
gave and they fell onto the tile 
floor. None of them broke, al- 
though the fall must have been 
from at least five feet. Nat was 
too wound up in his thoughts 
to notice and I was getting used 
to miracles. We left the proprie- 
tor with his mouth open and met 
Danny, the cop, looking in at the 
door, also with his mouth open. 

On the sidewalk, a man walk- 
ing in front of Nat stooped sud- 
denly to tie his shoe and Nat, to 
avoid bumping him, stepped off 
the curb and a taxi swerved to 
avoid Nat. The street was still 
wet and the taxi skidded, its rear 
end lightly flipping the front of 
one of those small foreign cars, 
which was going father fast. It 

fl9 



AM A NUCLEUS 



turned sideways and, without any 
side-slip, went right up the stoop 
of a brownstone opposite, coming 
to rest with its nose inside the 
front door, which a man opened 
at that moment. 

The sight of this threw another 
driver into a skid, and when he 
and the taxi had stopped sliding 
around, they were face to face, 
arranged crosswise to the street. 
This gave them exactly no room 
to move either forward or back- 
ward, for the car had its back to 
a hydrant and the taxi to a lamp. 



Although rather narrow, this is 
a two-way street, and in no time 
at all, traffic was stacked up from 
both directions as far as the av- 
enues. Everyone was honking his 
horn. 

Danny was furious — more so 
when he tried to put through a 
call to his station house from the 
box opposite. 

It was out of order. 

TTPSTAIRS, the wind was 
blowing into the apartment 
and I closed the windows, mainly 




120

to shut out the tumult and the 
shouting. Nat had brightened up 
considerably. 

“I’ll stay for one more drink 
and then I’m due at the office,” 
he said. “You know, I think this 
would make an item for the 
paper.” He grinned and nodded 
toward the pandemonium. 

When he was gone, I noticed it 
was getting dark and turned on 
the desk lamp. Then I saw the 



curtains. They were all tied in 
knots, except one. That was tied 
in three knots. 

All right, I told myself, it was 
the wind. But I felt the time had 
come for me to get expert advice, 
so I went to the phone to call 
McGill. McGill is an assistant 
professor of mathematics at a 
university uptown and lives near 
us. He is highly imaginative, but 
we believe he knows everything. 



I AM A NUCLEUS 



121 






When I picked up the receiver, 
the line sounded dead and I 
thought, more trouble. Then I 
heard a man cough and I said 
hello. McGill’s voice said, “Alec? 
You must have picked up the re- 
ceiver just as we were connected. 
That’s a damn funny coinci- 
dence.” 

“Not in the least,” I said. “Come 
on over here. I’ve got something 
for you to work on.” 

“Well, as a matter of fact, I 
was calling up to ask you and 
Molly - ” 

“Molly’s away for the week. 
Can you get over here quick? 
It’s urgent.” 

“At once,” he said, and hung 
up. 

While I waited, I thought I 
might try getting down a few 
paragraphs of my novel — per- 
haps something would come now. 
It did, but as I came to a point 
where I was about to put down 
the word “agurgling,” I decided it 
was too reminiscent of Gilbert 
and Sullivan, and stopped at the 
letter “R.” Then I saw that I had 
unaccountably hit all four keys 
one step to the side of the correct 
ones, and tore out the page, with 
my face red. 

This was absolutely not my 
day. 

^WfEIX” McGill said, “no- 
” thing you’ve told me is 
impossible or supernatural. Just 

122 



very, very improbable. In fact, 
the odds against that poker game 
alone would lead me to suspect 
Nat, well as I know him. It’s all 
those other things . .” 

He got up and walked over to 
the window and looked at the hot 
twilight while I waited. Then he 
turned around; he had a look of 
concern. 

“Alec, you’re a reasonable guy, 
so I don’t think you’ll take of- 
fense at what I’m going to say. 
What you have told me is so 
impossibly unlikely, and the odds 
against it so astronomical, that I 
must take the view that you’re 
either stringing me or you’re sub- 
ject to a delusion.” I started to 
get up and expostulate, but he 
motioned me back. “I know, but 
don’t you see that that is far 
more likely than . .” He stopped 
and shook his head. Then he 
brightened. “I have an idea. 
Maybe we can have a demonstra- 
tion.” 

He thought for a tense minute 
and snapped his fingers. “Have 
you any change on you?” 

“Why, yes,” I said. “Quite a 
bit.” I reached into my pocket. 
There must have been nearly 
two dollars in silver and pennies. 
“Do you think they’ll each have 
the same date, perhaps?” 

“Did you accumulate all that 
change today?” 

“No. During the week.” 

He shook his head. “In that 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



case, no. Discounting the fact that 
you could have prearranged it, if 
my dim provisional theory is 
right, that would be actually im- 
possible. It would involve time- 
reversal. I’ll tell you about it 
later. No, just throw down the 
change. Let’s see if they all come 
up heads.” 

I moved away from the carpet 
and tossed the handful of coins 
onto the floor. They clattered and 
bounced — and bounced together 
— and stacked themselves into a 
neat pile. 

I looked at McGill. His eyes 
were narrowed. Without a word, 
he took a handful of coins from 
his own pocket and threw them. 

These coins didn’t stack. They 
just fell into an exactly straight 
line, the adjacent ones touching. 

“Well,” I said, “what more do 
you want?” 

“Great Scott,” he said, and sat 
down. “I suppose you know that 
there are two great apparently 
opposite principles governing the 
Universe — random and design. 
The sands on the beach are an 
example of random distribution 
and life is an example of design. 
The motions of the particles of a 
gas are what we call random, but 
there are so many of them, we 
treat them statistically and de- 
rive the Second Law of Thermo- 
dynamics — quite reliable. It isn’t 
theoretically hard-and-fast; it’s 
just a matter of extreme probabil- 



ity. Now life, on the other hand, 
seems not to depend on proba- 
bility at all; actually, it goes 
against it. Or you might say it is 
certainly not an accidental man- 
ifestation.” 

“Do you mean,” I asked in 
some confusion, “that some form 
of life is controlling the coins and 
— the other things?” 

TTE SHOOK his head. “No. All 
I mean is that improbable 
things usually have improbable 
explanations. When I see a nat- 
ural law being broken, I don’t 
say to myself, ‘Here’s a miracle.’ 
I revise my version of the book 
of rules. Something — I don’t 
know what — is going on, and it 
seems to involve probability, and 
it seems to center around you. 
Were you still in that building 
when the elevators stuck? Or 
near it?” 

“I guess I must have been. It 
happened just after I left.” 

“Hm. You’re the center, all 
right. But why?” 

“Center of what?” I asked. “I 
feel as though I were the center 
of an electrical storm. Something 
has it in for me!” 

McGill grinned. “Don’t be su- 
perstitious. And especially don’t 
be anthropomorphic.” 

“Well, if it’s the opposite of ran- 
dom, it’s got to be a form of life.” 
“On what basis? All we know 
for certain is that random motions 



AM A NUCLEUS 



123 



are being rearranged. A crystal, 
for example, is not life, but it’s a 
non-random arrangement of par- 
ticles ... I wonder.” He had a 
faraway, frowning look. 

I was beginning to feel hungry 
and the drinks had worn off. 

“Let’s go out and eat,” I said, 
“There’s not a damn thing in the 
kitchen and I’m not allowed to 
cook. Only eggs and coffee.” 

We put on our hats and went 
down to the street. From either 
end, we could hear wrecking 
trucks towing away the stalled 
cars. There were, by this time, a 
number of harassed cops direct- 
ing the maneuver and we heard 
one of them say to Danny, “I 
don’t know what the hell’s going 
on around here. Every goddam 
car’s got something the matter 
with it. They can’t none of them 
back out for one reason or an- 
other. Never seen anything like 
it.” 

Near us, two pedestrians were 
doing a curious little two-step as 
they tried to pass one another; as 
soon as one of them moved aside 
to let the other pass, the other 
would move to the same side. 
They both had embarrassed grins 
on their faces, but before long 
their grins were replaced by looks 
of suspicion and then determina- 
tion. 

“All right, smart guy!” they 
shouted in unison, and barged 
ahead, only to collide. They 



backed off and threw simultane- 
ous punches which met in mid- 
air. Then began one of the most 
remarkable bouts ever witnessed 
— a fight in which fist hit fist but 
never anything else, until both 
champions backed away unde- 
feated, muttering identical ex- 
cuses and threats. 

r| ANNY appeared at that mo- 
ment. His face was dripping. 
“You all right, Mr. Graham?” 
he asked. “I don’t know what’s 
going on around here, but ever 
since I came on this afternoon, 
things are going crazy. Bartley!” 
he shouted — he could succeed 
as a hog-caller. “Bring those 
dames over here!” 

Three women in a confused 
wrangle, with their half-open um- 
brellas intertwined, were brought 
across the street, which meant 
climbing over fenders. Bartley, a 
fine young patrolman, seemed 
self-conscious; the ladies seemed 
not to be. 

“All right, now, Mrs. Mac- 
Philip!” one of them said. “Leave 
go of my umbrella and we’ll say 
no more about it!” 

“And so now it’s Missus Mac- 
Philip, is it?” said her adversary. 

The third, a younger one with 
her back turned to us, her um- 
brella also caught in the tangle, 
pulled at it in a tentative way, 
at which the other two glared at 
her. She turned her head away 



124 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and tried to let go, but the handle 
was caught in her glove. She 
looked up and I saw it was Molly. 
My nurse-wife. 

“Oh, Alec!” she said, and man- 
aged to detach herself. “Are you 
all right?” Was / all right! 

“Molly! What are you doing 
here?” 

“I was so worried, and when I 
saw all this, I didn’t know what 
to think.” She pointed to the 
stalled cars. “Are you really all 
right?” 

“Of course I’m all right. But 
why . .” 

“The Oyster Bay operator said 
someone kept dialing and dialing 
Mother’s number and there 
wasn’t anyone on the line, so 
then she had it traced and it 
came from our phone here. I 
kept calling up, but I only got a 
busy signal. Oh, dear, are you 
sure you’re all right?” 

I put my arm around her and 
glanced at McGill. He had an 
inward look. Then I caught Dan- 
ny’s eye. It had a thoughtful, al- 
most suspicious cast to it. 

“Trouble does seem to follow 
you, Mr. Graham,” was all he 
said. 

When we got upstairs, I turned 
to McGill. “Explain to Molly,” 
I said. “And incidentally to me. 
I’m not properly briefed yet.” 

He did so, and when he got to 
the summing up, I had the feeling 
she was a jump ahead of him. 



“In other words, you think it’s 
something organic?” 

“Well,” McGill said, “I’m try- 
ing to think of anything else it 
might be. I’m not doing so well,” 
he confessed. 

“But so far as I can see,” Molly 
answered, “it’s mere probability, 
and without any over-all pattern.” 
“Not quite. It has a center. 
Alec is the center.” 

]%/[■ OLLY looked at me with a 
curious expression for a mo- 
ment. “Do you feel all right, dar- 
ling?” she asked me. I nodded 
brightly. “You’ll think this silly 
of me,” she went on to McGill, 
“but why isn’t it something like 
an overactive poltergeist?” 

“Pure concept,” he said. “No 
genuine evidence.” 

“Magnetism?” 

“Absolutely not. For one thing, 
most of the objects affected 
weren’t magnetic — and don’t 
forget magnetism is a force, not 
a form of energy, and a great 
deal of energy has been involved. 
I admit the energy has mainly 
been supplied by the things them- 
selves, but in a magnetic field, 
all you’d get would be stored 
kinetic energy, such as when a 
piece of iron moves to a magnet 
or a line of force. Then it would 
just stay there, like a rundown 
clock weight. These things do a 
lot more than that — they go on 
moving.” 



I AM A NUCLEUS 



125 



“Why did you mention a crys- 
tal before? Why not a life-form?” 
“Only an analogy,” said McGill. 
“A crystal resembles life in that 
it has a definite shape and ex- 
hibits growth, but that’s all. I’ll 
agree this — thing — has no dis- 
cernible shape and motion is in- 
volved, but plants don’t move 
and amebas have no shape. Then 
a crystal feeds, but it does not 
convert what it feeds on; it merely 
rearranges it into a non-random 
pattern. In this case, it’s rearrang- 
ing random motions and it has 
a nucleus and it seems to be grow- 
ing — at least in what you might 
call improbability.” 

Molly frowned. “Then what is 
it? What’s it made of?” 

“I should say it was made of 
the motions. There’s a similar 
idea about the atom. Another 
thing that’s like a crystal is that 
it appears to be forming around 
a nucleus not of its own material 
— the way a speck of sand thrown 
into a supersaturated solution be- 
comes the nucleus of crystalliza- 
tion.” 

“Sounds like the pearl in an 
oyster,” Molly said, and gave me 
an impertinent look. 

“Why,” I asked McGill, “did 
you say the coins couldn’t have 
the same date? I mean apart 
from the off chance I got them 
that way.” 

“Because I don’t think this 
thing got'going before today and 

126 



everything that’s happened can 
all be described as improbable 
motions here and now. The dates 
were already there, and to change 
them would require retroactive 
action, reversing time. That’s out, 
in my book. That telephone 
now — ” 

The doorbell rang. We were 
not surprised to find it was the 
telephone repairman. He took the 
set apart and clucked like a hen. 

“I guess you dropped it on the 
floor, mister,” he said with strong 
disapproval. 

“Certainly not,” I said. “Is it 
broken?” 

“Not exactly broken, but — ” He 
shook his head and took it apart 
some more. 

]%/[ cGILL went over and they 
discussed the problem in un- 
dertones. Finally the man left 
and Molly called her mother to 
reassure her. McGill tried to ex- 
plain to me what had happened 
with the phone. 

“You must have joggled some- 
thing loose. And then you re- 
placed the receiver in such a way 
that the contact wasn’t quite 
open.” 

“But for Pete’s sake, Molly says 
the calls were going on for a long 
time! I phoned you only a short 
time ago and it must have taken 
her nearly two hours to get here 
from Oyster Bay.” 

“Then you must have done it 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



twice and the vibrations in the 
floor — something like that — just 
happened to cause the right in- 
duction impulses. Yes, I know 
how you feel,” he said, seeing my 
expression. “It’s beginning to bear 
down.” 

Molly was through telephoning 
and suggested going out for din- 
ner. I was so pleased to see her 
that I’d forgotten all about being 
hungry. 

“I’m in no mood to cook,” she 
said. “Let’s get away from all 
this.” 

McGill raised an eyebrow. “If 
all this, as you call it, will let us.” 

In the lobby, we ran into Nat, 
looking smug in a journalistic 
way. 

“I’ve been put ori the story — 
who could be better? — I live 
here. So far, I don’t quite get 
what’s been happening. I’ve been 
talking to Danny, but he didn’t 
say much. I got the feeling he 
thinks you’re involved in some 
mystical, Hibernian way. Hello, 
McGill, what’s with you?” 

“He’s got a theory,” said Molly. 
“Come and eat with us and he’ll 
tell you all about it.” 

Since we decided on an air- 
conditioned restaurant nearby on 
Sixth Avenue, we walked. The 
jam of cars didn’t seem to be any 
less than before and we saw 
Danny again. He was talking to 
a police lieutenant, and when he 
caught sight of us, he said some- 



thing that made the lieutenant 
look at us with interest. Particu- 
larly at me. 

“If you want your umbrella, 
Mrs. Graham,” Danny said, “it’s 
at the station house. What there’s 
left of it, that is.” 

Molly thanked him and there 
was a short pause, during which 
I felt the speculative regard of 
the lieutenant. I pulled out a 
packet of cigarettes, which I had 
opened, as always, by tearing off 
the top. I happened to have it 
upside down and all the cigarettes 
fell out. Before I could move my 
foot to obliterate what they had 
spelled out on the sidewalk, the 
two cops saw it. The lieutenant 
gave me a hard look, but said 
nothing. I quickly kicked the in- 
sulting cigarettes into the gutter. 

When we got to the restaurant, 
it was crowded but cool — al- 
though it didn’t stay cool for long. 
We sat down at a side table near 
the door and ordered Tom Col- 
linses as we looked at the menu. 
Sitting at the next table were a 
fat lady, wearing a very long, 
brilliant green evening gown, and 
a dried-up sour-looking man in a 
tux. When the waiter returned, 
they preempted him and began 
ordering dinner fussily: cold cuts 
for the man, and vichyssoise, lob- 
ster salad and strawberry parfait 
for the fat lady. 

I tasted my drink. It was most 
peculiar; salt seemed to have 



I AM A NUCLEUS 



127 



been used instead of sugar. I men- 
tioned this and my companions 
tried theirs, and made faces. 

T HE WAITER was concerned 
and apologetic, and took the 
drinks back to the bar across the 
room. The bartender looked over 
at us and tasted one of the drinks. 
Then he dumped them in his sink 
with a puzzled expression and 
made a new batch. After shaking 
this up, he set out a row of 
glasses, put ice in them and began 
to pour. 

That is to say he tilted the 
shaker over the first one, but 
nothing came out. He bumped it 
against the side of the bar and 
tried again. Still nothing. Then 
he took off the top and pried 
into it with his pick, his face pink 
with exasperation. 

I had the impression that the 
shaker had frozen solid. Well, ice 
is a crystal, I thought to myself. 

The other bartender gave him 
a fresh shaker, but the same thing 
happened, and I saw no more be- 
cause the customers sitting at the 
bar crowded around in front of 
him, offering advice. Our waiter 
came back, baffled, saying he’d 
have the drinks in a moment, and 
went to the kitchen. When he 
returned, he had madame’s vichy- 
ssoise and some rolls, which he 
put down, and then went to the 
bar, where the audience had 
grown larger. 

128 



Molly lit a cigarette and said, 
“I suppose this is all part of it, 
Alec. Incidentally, it seems to be 
getting warmer in here.” 

It was, and I had the feeling 
the place was quieter — a back- 
ground noise had stopped. It 
dawned on me that I no longer 
heard the faint hum of the air- 
conditioner over the door, and as 
I started to say so, I made a 
gesture toward it. My hand col- 
lided with Molly’s when she 
tapped her cigarette over the ash- 
tray, and the cigarette landed in 
the neighboring vichyssoise. 

“Hey! What’s the idea?” snarled 
the sour-looking man. 

“I’m terribly sorry,” I said. “It 
was an accident. I — ” 

“Throwing cigarettes at peo- 
ple!” the fat lady said. 

“I really didn’t mean to,” I 
began again, getting up. There 
must have been a hole in the 
edge of their tablecloth which 
one of my cuff buttons caught in, 
because as I stepped out from 
between the closely set tables, I 
pulled everything — tablecloth, 
silver, water glasses, ashtrays and 
the vichyssoise-a-la-nicotine— onto 
the floor. 

The fat lady surged from the 
banquette and slapped me meat- 
fly. The man licked his thumb 
and danced as boxers are popu- 
larly supposed to do. The owner 
of the place, a man with thick 
black eyebrows, hustled toward 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



us with a determined manner. I 
tried to explain what had hap- 
pened, but I was outshouted, and 
the owner frowned darkly. 

O NE OF the waiters came up 
to the owner and tapped him 
on the shoulder and started to 
tell him about the air-conditioner, 
thus creating a momentary diver- 
sion, which did not, however, in- 
clude the fat lady. 

“He must be drunk!” she told 
her companion, who nodded con- 
temptuously. A man carrying a 
stepladder came down the aisle 
from the back, his eye on the air- 
conditioner, but not, it seemed, 
on the stepladder, which bumped 
the owner of the restaurant on 
the shoulder just as he was turn- 
ing back to me. 

It was not a hard bump, but 
it threw him off balance, so that 
he more or less embraced the 
waiter. Then he turned around 
and it was obvious he thought I 
had struck him. The room was 
now divided into two groups : our- 
selves and our audience, and 
those who were too far away or 
intent on other matters to have 
noticed the fracas, the chief of 
these being the man with the 
stepladder, who was paying un- 
divided attention to the air-con- 
ditioner. The owner was very 
angry with me. 

“Mister, I think you’d better 
leave!” he said. 



“He will not!” Molly said. “It 
was an accident, and you,” she 
adde to the fat lady who was 
about to interrupt, “keep quiet! 
We’ll buy you some more soup!” 

“Maybe it was an accident like 
you say,” the owner declared, “but 
no one’s going to push me when 
my back is turned! Out you go, 
mister! The drinks are on the 
house.” 

“We haven’t had any drinks 
yet,” I said. “There was salt in 
them.” 

“What d’you mean, salt? My 
bartenders — ” 

The air-conditioner suddenly 
let out a loud whirring and I 
glanced up. The stepladder which 
the man was on began to slide 
open like an acrobatic dancer 
doing a split. I stepped past the 
angry restaurateur and put out 
my hand to stop it, but as I did, 
the extension-bar that was sup- 
posed to hold it together parted 
and it came down with a rush, 
knocking over several tables. The 
repairman pulled part of the 
works out with him as he fell 
and the fan-belt broke. The motor 
raced and black smoke poured 
out. 

“What’re you trying to cfo!” the 
owner yelled at me over the loud 
whine of the machinery. “Goddam 
it, haven’t you done enough al- 
ready?” 

I took two steps back, in dis- 
may at what I was accused of, 



I AM A NUCLEUS 



129 



and stepped on the skirt of the 
fat lady’s green evening gown. 
She in turn took two steps and 
was, as it were, laid bare. 

The previous hubbub was as 
nothing to what now resulted 
and the smoke was becoming 
thicker. Then the door opened 
and, to my horror, Danny and his 
lieutenant came in, and I was the 
first thing their eyes fastened on. 
Everyone started shouting at 
once and pointing at me. 

Then the sprinkler system went 
on. 

r I ’ HE CELL was clean, al- 
though very hot, and I was 
not treated badly. There was, in 
fact, an air of superstitious re- 
spect, almost. A cop gave me 
some magazines and, against reg- 
ulations, a late paper, but it was 
not late enough to carry the story 
of the restaurant mob-scene. In 
it, however, was a garbled ac- 
count of our traffic jam and a 
reference to the six elevators 
simultaneously and unaccount- 
ably stuck in the I.T.V. Building, 
but no connection was suggested. 

My mind was in too much of 
an uproar to read, and I paced 
up and down. It seemed hours 
since McGill had called my 
lawyer Vinelli; some fantastic 
mishap must be holding him up, 
I thought. Then I happened to 
bump into the door of the cell 
and found the lock hadn’t caught.

More of the same! But there 
didn’t seem any point in trying 
to escape. Where would I go? 
Besides, I would have to leave 
through the desk room, where 
there would be at least the desk 
lieutenant and a sergeant on the 
phone. I began to wonder what 
effect it would have if I were 
to call out and tell them. 

“Hey!” I shouted, but my voice 
was drowned out by a blast from 
the radio in the squad room. It 
died down immediately; someone 
must have hit a loud spot on the 
dial. I had an idea. 

“Hey!” I shouted again, and 
again was drowned out. I opened 
the barred door and looked up 
and down the corridor. No one 
was in sight. Without making any 
unnecessary noise, but not stealth- 
ily, either, I walked as naturally 
as I could past the door to the 
squad room, where all heads were 
turned away, listening to the sen- 
sational pronouncements of Bill 
Bart, the radio gossip. 

“. and in your commentator’s 
view, this man is dangerous! After 
attacking a woman and setting 
fire to a restaurant, he was ar- 
rested and is being held for in- 
vestigation, but I predict that the 
double-domes and alleged scien- 
tists will come up with some more 
gobbledegook and we ordinary 
citizens will be left in the dark 
as to why or how Graham is 
causing all this trouble. So far, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



fortunately, no one has been seri- 
ously injured, but I predict . 

I left and went on down the 
corridor. 

So Bill Bart was giving me a 
play! What kind of crazy guess- 
work was he foisting on his pub- 
lic, I wondered, and came to the 
the desk room. I looked in at the 
door. On one side, a sergeant 
was talking to an elderly worried- 
looking couple and never turned 
his head. On the other, a gray- 
haired lieutenant sitting at the 
raised desk dropped his glasses as 
I came in. They fell on the floor 
and smashed. 

“Mother of God!” he muttered 
and gave me a cursory glance. 
“Good night, Doctor,” he said. 
“Not that there’s anything good 
about it.” He was fumbling in the 
desk as I walked out of the door. 

l"kN THE other side of the 
street, in the shadows, was a 
man who crossed over as I came 
down the steps. It was McGill. 

“I had a hunch this might hap- 
pen,” he said, taking my arm. 
“The car’s up ahead. Vinelli came 
here as quick as he could, but he 
slipped coming along the street 
and broke his ankle.” 

“Judas!” I said. “I am sorry! 
I feel responsible. Where are we 
going?” 

He didn’t answer me at first; 
he just kept hurrying me along. 
One of those New York siroccos 



was pretending to cool the city, 
and at the comer I saw his old 
coupe with the parking lights on. 
A saloon next to us was closing 
up and a few late customers came 
out onto the sidewalk. One cus- 
tomer, on seeing me, stopped and 
turned to the others. 

“That’s the guy I was telling 
you about! That’s Graham!” 

I saw then that it was our tele- 
phone repairman from the after- 
noon. He looked reasonably sober, 
but his friends did not. 

“Oh, yeah?” one of these said, 
eying me belligerently. “I thought 
we just heard Bill Bart broadcast 
the cops had him.” 

“Right,” said another of them. 
“He’s escaped! I’ll hold him and 
you go on in and phone ’em.” 
“Nah, the joint’s closed. Police 
station’s right around the corner. 
I’ll go tell ’em. Hold onto him 
now!” 

The repairman and three of his 
pals began to advance warily and 
the other one ran down Charles 
Street, but at that moment we 
heard excited yapping and a 
small dog chasing a cat came 
tearing up the street. The cat had 
a fish head in its mouth and, 
ignoring us, ran through the mid- 
dle of the group, dropping the 
fish head. The dog followed 
almost instantly, only he ran be- 
tween the repairman’s legs, up- 
setting him. In falling, the repair- 
man tripped his neighbor, who fell 



I AM A NUCLEUS 



131 



on him, and another one fell on 
top of them. The remaining one 
stepped on the fish head. 

“Black cat!” he cried as he 
joined the others on the sidewalk. 
“Crossed my path!” 

We got into McGill’s car and 
he pulled away fast. As I looked 
back, the four men were flailing 
around, but they saw the direction 
we took. I also thought I saw the 
street lamp behind us go out. 

“That was a lucky break!” I 
said. “I mean the cat and dog.” 
“Don’t give it a thought,” 
McGill said, driving fast but care- 
fully up Hudson Street. “You’re 
being watched over and pro- 
tected. We’re going up to my 
office and have a conference and 
we’re going to drive like hell. I 
have an idea this thing may not 
be able to do much more than 
hang onto you. Maybe we can 
even shake it.” 

“Hang onto me?” 

“Yes, you’re the nucleus.” 

VV/ T E WERE at the top of the 
W ramp to the Westside High- 
way and he abruptly put on more 
speed: no traffic was in sight. 

“But what is it?” I asked a 
little wildly. “How’s it doing it? 
Why pick on me?” 

“I don’t know, but I’d say it 
picked you as the nucleus because 
you had just been the subject of 
various flukes — the taxi and sub- 
way and so on — so you repre- 

132 



sented a sample of what it’s made 
of — flukes. I have a hunch you’ll 
continue to be protected.” 

“Did you happen to catch Bill 
Bart’s broadcast?” 

“Yes, I did. On the car radio 
coming over. Not good. He said—” 
In the rear-view mirror, I saw 
a police car overhauling us. We 
were doing a good sixty-five. 
“Here come the cops,” I inter- 
rupted, but before McGill could 
answer, there was a faint pop and 
the police car wobbled and slowed 
to a stop, and was quickly out 
of sight. 

“Blowout,” I said. 

“See what I mean?” McGill 
answered, and turned on two 
wheels into the 125th Street exit. 
Then he added, “Molly’s waiting 
for us in my office.” 

I felt better. 

We drove through some im- 
mortal gateway and McGill mod- 
erated his speed. He pulled up in 
front of a darkened building and 
we climbed the steps. It seemed 
cooler here and the wind was 
very strong. McGill tried the 
door, but it was locked. Then he 
felt in his pocket and swore. 
“No key?” I asked. 

He shook his head and then 
shook the door, and went through 
his pockets again. I reached for- 
ward and shook the door, too. 
The lock clicked and we went in. 
I made an apologetic gesture and 
McGill raised his eyebrows. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



We climbed a flight of stairs, 
all dark except for a faint glow 
that came in from the campus 
lights, and then along an echoing 
hallway to an office in which were 
Molly and some unimportant 
items, among them a desk radio 
that she turned off as we came in. 

She gave me her professional 
nurse’s smile and I sat down next 
her. Molly’s professional nurse’s 
smile is not a phony “Every- 
thing’s going to be all right,” but 
a signal. It’s supposed to mean 
“Never mind what these cretins 
are saying about you. You’re 
okay.” 

I was a little puzzled that she 
showed no surprise to see me. 

“Well,” McGill said, “my hunch 
was right. He got out.” 

“So I see,” said Molly, smiling 
at me proudly. “What happened? 
Knock over one of the jailers?” 
I shook my head and told her, 
including the cat-and-dog episode 
and the police car blowout. 

“Don’t forget the lock down- 
stairs,” McGill said, and when I 
told her that, too, he added, “You 
see, I think it’s beginning to take 
sides. I think it’s watching out 
for its nucleus. Alec ought to be 
rather lucky right now.” 

“Well, I don’t feel it,” I said. 
“I feel hemmed in.” 

1%/TOLLY glanced at me anx- 
iously and turned back to 
him. “What do we do now?” 



“First, before any more funny 
stuff happens, I want to rig up a 
few tests and see what’s with 
Alec, if anything. I’ll even test for 
EMF, Molly, just for the sake of 
satisfying you.” 

“For what?” I asked. 

“Electromagnetic force. Come 
and give me a hand, Molly. Alec, 
you stay put and relax. We’ll call 
you when we get set. I only hope 
to God the cops and the news- 
hawks don’t tumble to where we 
are.” 

They left and I went to the 
window and looked out at the 
wind blowing papers and dust 
into miniature tornadoes in the 
dim light, and wondered whether 
it was going to storm. A few 
belated students on the way to 
their dormitories evidently were 
wondering the same thing, for 
they were all looking up at the 
sky. I went to the desk and 
turned the radio on, low. 

“. are doing all they can, 
which doesn’t seem much,” Bill 
Bart was saying breathlessly. “He 
was last seen speeding uptown 
on the Westshore Drive, but the 
cops lost him. The town is gripped 
in superstitious fear — it is now 
known that Graham was respon- 
sible for the elevators jamming 
in the I.T.V. Building this morn- 
ing — but how did he do it? I ask 
you: how? And how has he turned 
off all the electric power in 
Greenwich Village? I contacted 



I AM A NUCLEUS 



133 



the power company for an ex- 
planation, but I was put off with 
the usual doubletalk. I say, and 
I repeat, this man must be caught! 
He is . 

I turned him off. So that was 
what the street light going off 
had meant. 

In a little while, Molly came 
back. “All right, duck, come and 
be measured. He’s got galvanom- 
eters and electronic devices and 
stuff, and he’ll be able to detect 
anything you’re emanating down 
to a milli-micro-whisker.” 

I followed her into the lab 
where I was sat down, taped up 
and surrounded with gadgets. 
McGill tried various things and 
read various dials. There were 
buzzing sounds and little lights 
blinked on and off, but at the 
end he shook his head. 

“Nothing,” he announced, 
“You’re married to a non-ferrous, 
non-conducting, non-emanating, 
non-magnetic writer, Molly.” 

“He is, too!” she said. “He’s as 
magnetic as the dickens.” 

“Possibly, but he isn’t emanat- 
ing anything. The damn thing 
apparently just likes him. As a 
nucleus, I mean.” 

“Is that bad?” Molly asked. 
“Could it be dangerous?” 

“It’s bad,” I put in morosely. 
“Also it could be good,” McGill 
said, with a gleam of scientific 
enthusiasm, “Why, it wouldn’t 
surprise me, Alec, if you could do 

134 



anything you wanted to that in- 
volved chance.” 

I" didn’t like the guinea-pigs’- 
eye view of him I got, and told 
him so. “Except for a couple of 
minor escapes, it’s been highly in- 
convenient,” I said. “I don’t want 
to seem ungrateful, but I wish it 
would go and help somebody 
else.” 

“But, my God, man! Do you 
realize if you went to the track 
tomorrow, your horse probably 
couldn’t lose?” 

“I wouldn’t get that far,” I 
grumbled. 

“And I bet if somebody threw 
a knife at you, it would miss!” 
McGill went on, ignoring me. 
“Here, I’d like to try an experi- 
ment . .” 

“Now, hold on!” I said. 

“ McGill ! Are you crazy?” Molly 
cried, but he ignored her also 
and opened his desk drawer, 
from which he took a pair of 
dice. 

“Roll me some sevens, Alec,” 
he said, handing them to me. 

“I thought we came here for 
a conference,” I protested. “And 
I don’t know whether you know 
about it, but there’s been a Vil- 
lage-wide electric power failure 
and I’m being blamed, according 
to Bill Bart.” 

“Holy cow! When did you hear 
that?” 

“On your radio just now. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Furthermore, he says the whole 
town is gripped in ‘superstitious 
terror.’ ” 

“That could be true,” McGill 
answered. “Most people haven’t 
progressed beyond the Dark Ages. 
Look what happened with Orson 
Welles’ broadcast about the Mar- 
tians.” 

“Maybe we ought to leave town 
for a while.” Molly said. “We 
could go to Oyster Bay or some- 
where.” Then she glanced up. 
“What’s that noise?” 

Outside, I now noticed, mingled 
with the soughing of the wind, a 
susurrus of many voices. We went 
to the lab windows. A crowd of 
two or three hundred people was 
standing in the campus, staring 
up at the sky over us. 

“What are they looking at?” 
McGill asked. “No one can pos- 
sibly know we’re here.” 

I started to lean out of the 
window, twisting up my head to 
see what it could be. 

“Don’t do that, Alec! They’ll 
see you!” McGill warned, and I 
pulled my head in. 

“Can we get on the roof?” I 
asked, but Molly suddenly said, 
“Look who’s here.” Three squad 
cars drove up and several police- 
men got out. 

“Perhaps we ought to sort of 
very gently turn the lights off,” 
I suggested. 

Molly immediately snapped 
off the shaded bench lamp, which 



was all that was on in the lab. 
This left McGill’s office light, and 
I started toward it. 

“Hadn’t we better run for it?” 
Molly said, but a loud banging 
on the front door downstairs 
answered her. 

“I hope that damn lock doesn’t 
give again!” McGill breathed. 

“They’ll break it down!” Molly 
gasped. 

“Like hell. It’s University prop- 
erty and they can’t possibly have 
gotten a search warrant so quick- 
ly at this time of night.” 

t'ROM outside came a loud 
voice: “Alec Graham! Are you 
in there?” 

“Don’t answer,” said McGill. 
“And keep away from the win- 
dows. I guess they saw the light 
in my office.” He leaned out. 
“What do you want?” he shouted. 

“This is the police. Open up!” 

“I won’t unless you have a 
warrant!” 

There was no more shouting. 
They seemed to be parlaying 
among themselves, but the crowd 
had a menacing sound. A brilliant 
light suddenly hit our windows, 
illuminating the lab ceiling — 
a police searchlight. I saw that 
Molly had disappeared and I 
assumed she had gone into Mc- 
Gill’s office. 

“These guys mean business,” 
he said, “but what the hell brought 
them?” 



I AM A NUCLEUS 



135 



“Something on the roof. That’s 
what they’re all looking at, so 
why don’t we go up and see?” 

“All right, but you’d better stay 
down here. There’s no parapet 
and they’ll see you.” 

He started for the door and I 
decided to follow — at least as 
far as the trapdoor, or whatever 
gave onto the roof — when Molly 
came in from the hall. She looked 
scared. 

“My God! I climbed an iron 
ladder and took a look outside. 
There’s a small cyclone over us 
— a ton of torn papers and dust 
and junk whirling around like a 
waterspout! They’d be able to 
see it for blocks! 

“Oh, great,” McGill groaned. 
“Now it’s playing tricks with the 
wind. That’s how they spotted 
us.” 

“We’ve got to get out of here, 
McGill,” said Molly. 

“Maybe the best thing would 
be for me to give myself up to 
the cops,” I said. 

“I don’t know whether they’d 
be able to get you through that 
mob,” McGill replied. “Just listen 
to them. I only wish I could 
think of some way to satisfy the 
damn crystal or whatever it is. 
I have the feeling it wants some- 
thing. It can’t be merely fooling 
around for no reason. But there 
doesn’t seem to be any motive 
beyond the fact that it’s appar- 
ently on your side. How did it 

136 



start? That’s what I wish I knew.” 

He absently turned the bench 
lamp on again. I shrugged un- 
happily and scratched my cheek. 
In so doing, I pulled the piece 
of pink adhesive tape loose and 
it began to bleed again. 

“Cut yourself shaving, dar- 
ling?” Molly asked me. 

“No,” I said. “As a matter of 
fact, it was a kind of freak acci- 
dent.” 

“Oh?” McGill lifted his head 
interestedly. “Anything involving 
you and a fluke I want to hear 
about. Tell Papa.” 

I did and McGill began to 
get his dedicated look. “You say 
this piece of glass just blew up? 
What did it look like? How big 
was it?” 

“I only saw it for a second. 
It was dirty and I’d say about two 
feet across — more or less round 
and with flat places all over it.” 

IVTcGILL came toward me in a 
state of great excitement. 
“That piece that hit your cheek 
— did it merely nick you or is it 
embedded? If it is embedded . .” 
He picked up a bottle of alcohol 
and a piece of cotton and took 
a lens out of a drawer. “Molly, 
there’s a pair of tweezers in my 
desk. Will you fetch them?” He 
tilted the light up onto my face 
and dabbed the cut with the 
alcohol. 

“Ouch!” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Keep still. It’ll sting a little. 
... Yes, I think I can see it.” He 
took the tweezers from Molly, 
who had returned, and neatly re- 
moved something from the cut. 
He held it under the light and 
looked at it through the lens. 
Then he rinsed it under the water 
faucet, dried it on a piece of 
filter-paper and looked at it again. 
“Well, it looks like glass. I don’t 
know. Maybe it’s the nucleus of 
the glass chunk and . .” His 
voice trailed off and he frowned 
at nothing in particular, putting 
the fragment down on the filter- 
paper. 

I picked it up. It seemed like 
a bit of sand, only brighter. 

McGill’s concern over this new 
object of interest had been so in- 
tent that for a few minutes our 
attention was diverted, but now 
Molly began to pace up and 
down. There didn’t seem to be 
anything for us to do, and unlike 
most nurses, waiting makes her 
nervous. She was looking at the 
display of various chemicals and 
reagents on the shelves. 

“What’s that stuff?” she asked, 
pointing to a large jar of black 
powder labeled Deflocculated 
Graphite. “I bet those cops have 
gone for a search warrant.” 
“Finely divided carbon,” Mc- 
Gill said. “Damn, I wish I could 
think of something! A chunk of 
glass . blowing up . .” 

“Graphite is carbon?” Molly 



said. “You don’t think they’d 
actually do anything to Alec, do 
you?” 

“It’s another form of carbon. 
A diamond is still another: the 
rare crystalline form,” he said. “I 
wouldn’t put it past that mob to 
do anything.” 

“Oh, yes. I remember that in 
chemistry,” Molly said. “But the 
police wouldn’t let them, McGill, 
would they?” 

“I’ve got an idea — ” I tried to 
break in. 

“They might not be able to 
stop them,” McGill replied. 

“We’ve got to get out of here!” 
Molly said for the second time. 

“If a diamond — ” I began. 

“With a helicopter, we might,” 
McGill said. “Right now, we’re 
surrounded.” 

“How about hiding Alec?” 
Molly asked. “You and I could 
act innocent.” 

“I don’t want to be hidden,” I 
objected. “My idea is — ” 

“Or better yet, we could act 
guilty. That would appeal to 
them, wouldn’t it, McGill?” 

“They’d tear the place apart 
if they got in McGill said. 

T TOOK a surreptitious look 
•*- out of the windows again. It 
seemed to hit me that our being 
surrounded was an exaggeration; 
most of the crowd was centered 
about the police car directly in 
front of the main door. They had

137 



an ugly look, and while I didn’t 
like the idea of being alone, 
neither did I relish the thought 
of my presence possibly causing 
my wife and my best friend to 
be the victims of mob violence, 
for although the police might, in 
the absence of a warrant, refrain 
from breaking in, the mob might 
not. So I decided to leave, con- 
fident that some bizarre mani- 
festation would lead them away 
from the lab, and that no matter 
where I went, I could hardly be 
worse off. To keep moving was 
my best bet. 

Molly and McGill were still 
discussing the situation as I tip- 
toed into the hall. There surely 
would be a back door — probably 
in the basement — and I went 
down three flights to a cement- 
floored corridor. Then, with 
lighted matches, I found my way 
to a door at the back of the 
building, at the end. I opened it 
and peered out, to see a retain- 
ing wall and stone steps leading 
up to ground level. I eased out 
into the areaway and pulled the 
door shut, noticing that I still 
held the folded filter-paper with 
the fragment in it. The lock 
clicked and I realized that my 
bridge was, as they say, burned 
behind me. 

Two cops were talking together 
a little way to my right, but their 
backs were turned and they were 
looking up. I, too, looked and 



saw the whirlpool of debris, which 
was exactly as Molly had de- 
scribed and quite as attention- 
calling. Clutching the filter-paper 
like a talisman, I climbed the 
steps and gumshoed away to the 
left, but as I got to the corner, 
I met a group of young men, also 
looking up. 

One of these was saying, “That’s 
a lynch mob, if ever I saw one! 
I don’t get it.” 

“Mob psychology, that’s the 
answer,” explained another. 

My heart congealed, but they 
walked right by me. It suddenly 
occurred to me that any news- 
papers that had carried the story 
would scarcely have been able 
to dig up a photograph of me yet. 
All I had to do was to walk out 
of the campus, for who would 
recognize me? Where I would 
go then was something I could 
decide later. 

So I started out with more 
assurance, but I took the precau- 
tion to act like an onlooker by 
glancing up over my shoulder 
now and then at the airborne 
maelstrom. 

As I got to the other side of 
the open space, I had another 
shock. A few yards ahead was 
another group of policemen, one 
of whom, I saw with dismay, was 
the lieutenant from Charles 
Street, and he was beginning to 
turn around. I barely had time 
to duck into a doorway to avoid 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



being seen. I had the feeling of 
a member of the I.R.A. in Dublin 
during the Troubles, and I 
crouched against the door. 

I could now hear the lieuten- 
ant’s voice: “Of course he’s up 
there! Maddigan’ll be here with 
a warrant any minute now and 
we’ll . His voice faded away. 

"DEHIND me, the door sudden- 
ly opened and I almost fell. 
A young student holding some 
notebooks emerged. 

“Sorry,” he said, and walked 
toward the crowd. 

The door had not yet closed 
and I slipped in, with my heart 
irretrievably contracted to the 
size of a buckshot. I could just 
make out in the dim light that I 
was at the bottom of the fire 
stairs, so I climbed to the third 
floor and went into a classroom, 
then on into an office somewhat 
like McGill’s, that faced toward 
the lab building. 

From here, I had a perfect 
view of the crowd, the police, 
the upper facade of the labs, 
brightly lit by the searchlight 
and, over all, the spinning papers 
and dust, which even as I looked 
began to die down. I was unable 
to see Molly or McGill and won- 
dered whether they had noticed 
my absence and were worrying. 

I saw a phone on the desk at 
my side and considered calling 
up McGill’s office, but first I 



wanted to think over my new 
idea. I pulled down the shades 
and turned on the reading lamp, 
by the light of which I re-ex- 
amined the fragment I had been 
carrying around all day. It 
sparkled brilliantly. On the desk, 
beside an onyx pen-set, a golf 
trophy and a signed golf ball, 
was a leather-framed photograph 
of a blank-faced young woman 
holding a pudgy little boy. I 
picked it up and rubbed the 
glass with the tiny fragment. It 
left a faint but undeniable scratch. 
So I was right about one thing. 

Then I called McGill’s office. 
In a few moments, I heard the 
receiver lifted, but no voice. “This 
is the nucleus,” I said, and I 
heard of sigh of relief from Mc- 
Gill. 

“Where in hell are you?” 
“Across the way. Look out of 
your window and I’ll turn my 
light off and on again.” I did so. 

“You’re in Professor Crandal’s 
office. Why did you leave?” 
“We’ll go into that later. Mc- 
Gill, that fragment is a diamond.” 
“What!” 

“At any rate, it scratches glass.” 
“Why didn’t you tell me that 
before? And where is it? I could- 
n’t find it anywhere.” 

“I was sidetracked. I’ve got it 
here. Now my idea — ” 

~ “A diamond! I begin to see 
light. Give with the idea, Alec.” 
“Well, there was all this talk

of crystals and then you were 
telling Molly about carbon and 
diamonds, and it occurred to me 
that what we have is something 
trying to crystallize — something 
that once was a crystal, and got 
broken up and wants to re-form. 
It keeps trying with playing cards 
and pigeons and automobiles, but 
it’s no go. Why don’t we give it 
some carbon to play with, Mc- 
Gill?” 

T HERE was a short silence. 

I looked across at the office, 
but I couldn’t see him. I noticed 
a piece of dirty newspaper that 
had fallen out of the maelstrom 
and had caught on a thick wire 
that stretched from one of the 
lab windows to immediately be- 
low mine — some kind of aerial, 
I imagined. Then I saw that the 
maelstrom, rather than breaking 
up, as I had thought, was moving 
over in my direction. I would be 
pointed out again. 

“You mean the graphite, I 
suppose,” McGill said. “Why in 
hell did you leave and take the 
fragment with you?” 

“I forgot it was in my hand,” 
I said, dodging the first part of 
the question. “Nobody on the 
campus recognized me, so I guess 
I can walk back.” Then I re- 
membered the locked basement 
door and the fact that I could 
scarcely be let in by McGill, with 
the cops standing around, but I

was feeling light-headed and dam- 
age-proof. It was protecting its 
nucleus, which, even if I wasn’t 
any more, I had in my hand. My 
crystalline rabbit’s foot. 

“Hold on a second,” I said. 
“I’ve got another idea.” 

I put down the receiver, and 
picked up the golf ball from the 
desk, and put it on the floor. I 
stood up and put my right foot 
on it and, holding my breath, I 
raised my other foot. In any 
event, I would not have far to 
fall — but I did not fall. I re- 
mained upright, holding the filter- 
paper and wobbling a little. Then 
I relaxed and closed my eyes — 
still I did not fall. The rabbit’s 
foot was working, just as McGill 
said. I stepped down two inches 
and picked up the phone. 

“I’m coming across,” I said. 
“That is, if the wire that runs 
over here from the lab is strong 
enough to hold me.” 

“Alec! You’re nuts!” McGill 
said, and I hung up. (Diamonds 
of the world, unite! You have 
nothing to lose but your nucleus.) 

I took a look over the sill at 
the wire. It was held by a power- 
ful steel eye-bolt, securely at- 
tached to the brickwork. Clutch- 
ing the diamond fragment in its 
paper, I climbed over the sill 
and put a foot on the wire and 
felt immediately seasick. The 
wire vibrated like a harp-string, 
but did not give noticeably, and

I put my other foot on it. Then 
I almost blacked out and closed 
my eyes. 

When I opened them again, I 
found I had progressed some 
distance into the void. Nothing 
was holding me from over-balanc- 
ing, but my body seemed to right 
itself automatically, as if I were 
a veteran tightrope walker. 

In a frozen daze, I edged along, 
keeping my eyes fixed on the 
distant window in which I could 
see McGill and Molly watching 
me with white faces. 

VV/’HEN I was about half way, 
” the crowd caught sight of 
me and yelled. A man with a 
broad-brimmed hat ran out from 
the others and, to my horror, 
pulled out a gun. Another man 
picked up a stone, wound himself 
up like a sand-lot pitcher, and 
hurled it just before the other 
pulled his trigger. They were ex- 
cellent shots: the stone was hit 
by the bullet and both disinte- 
grated. The man’s gun jammed 
at his second try and the two 
heroes were grabbed by the 
police. 

With my heart pounding, I 
kept going, until, about four yards 
from safety, my foot caught, and 
I looked down again. There was 
a splice in the wire, sticking up 
from which was a sharp end. I 
staggered and righted myself . 
and let go of the filter-paper. 



By now, the maelstrom was 
directly over me and my talisman 
was caught in the up-draught. It 
did not fall, but I did. After a 
sickening instant, I was brought 
up with a jerk that nearly 
strangled me. The back of my 
coat had caught on the projecting 
wire and I swung there like an 
unused marionette. 

The crowd shouted and milled 
around, and the cops called out 
directions to each other. One 
order was to send for the Fire 
Department. I found I could 
breathe, but I could not look 
down. 

The all-important paper was 
fluttering around near the lab 
window and McGill was making 
grabs at it. Then it suddenly blew 
right in by him. His head reap- 
peared and he shook his clasped 
hands at me. Molly remained at 
the window, her eyes round, the 
fingers of each hand crossed. I 
essayed a debonair smile, which 
she tried to answer. In the dis- 
tance, I heard the owl-sound of 
approaching fire engines. 

From behind Molly there sud- 
denly came an intense blue light, 
which rapidly increased until she 
became a dark silhouette, and I 
could just make out McGill look- 
ing at the glare, his eyes shielded 
by what I took to be a deep-blue 
bottle. His stance suggested ela- 
tion. There appeared to be a 
terrific in-draught —all the win-

dow shades were blowing straight 
into the lab and Molly’s red hair 
streamed behind her. 

In what was actually almost 
no time, I heard the Fire De- 
partment turn into the campus, 
and one piece of equipment 
skidded to a stop directly under 
me. There was the sound of a- 
winch and then I felt something 
touch my foot. At that moment, 
my jacket gave way with a tear- 
ing sound, Molly closed her eyes, 
and I landed like an oversize 
tarantula on top of the fireman’s 
ladder. 

Firemen and cops were climb- 
ing toward me, alternated like 
meat and tomatoes on a shish- 
kebab. First to reach me was my 
friend the lieutenant. He re- 
arrested me and pulled. I shook 
my head to his earnest entreaties 
and hung on with the tenacity of 
the unbrave. It seems to be im- 
possible to detach a determined 
man from a ladder when you are 
also on it. 

He and his friends gave up 
finally and ordered the ladder 
lowered, but one last fluke inter- 
vened — if it was a fluke. The 
machinery refused to work and 
we drove away, with me swaying 
grandly on my perch. 

r I ’HE lieutenant had the hook- 
and-ladder driven to a distant 
police station, where in due course 
Vinelli, the lawyer, arrived with

his foot in a cast, and I was 
bailed out. The cops showed me 
surprising consideration; it turned 
out they were furious at the ir- 
responsible riding they had been 
getting from Bill Bart. A scien- 
tific big-shot that McGill knew, 
named Joe Stein, convinced them 
I was in no way to blame, and 
the case was dropped. Professor 
Stein gave a wonderfully incom- 
prehensible but tranquilizing 
statement to the press, and Molly 
and I went to Oyster Bay. 

“In two weeks, everybody’ll 
have forgotten all about it,” the 
lieutenant told us. “You may even 
be a hero. I don’t know.” 

Before we left, we went with 
McGill to the lab and saw the 
diamond. It sat on a bench, 
gleaming brilliant, smooth-faceted 
and without a flaw. It was at 
least two feet across, about the 
same as the chunk of “glass” on 
Fifty-first Street. 

“The cops never recognized 
what it was,” McGill said, “it 
being so big.” 

“Who would?” Molly asked. 
“McGill, I’ve got an idea — ” 

“All I had to do,” McGill said, 
ignoring her, “was to put the 
graphite on some cinder blocks 
and the fragment on the graphite. 
Then I turned a bunsen flame on 
it and it caught fire with a terrif- 
ically bright flame — very small 
—I quess you saw it.” I nodded. 
“It didn’t give off any heat,” he 

143 



went on. “Adiabatic process. And 
it got its necessary pressure from 
the random motions together of 
the graphite particles. Some ran- 
dom motions! When that was 
used up, it started on the cinder 
blocks and then the C0 2 in the 
air. That’s what caused the suc- 
tion : the blinds were blown 

straight in. You probably missed 
that.” I shook my head. “Any- 
way, this thing — ” 

“McGill,” Molly interrupted, 
“I’ve got an idea!" 

this thing has got to be 
dumped out at sea.” 

“Oh,” Molly said, looking crest- 
fallen. “I was just going to say 
why don’t we break a piece off 
and sell it in Amsterdam?” 

“God God, no! That would only 
start it up all over again!” 

“Just a little piece, McGill?” 
“NO!” 

With Stein’s help, McGill con- 
vinced the police that the thing 
had to be dumped, and we 
dropped it off a police launch 
beyond Sandy Hook, to their 



bored perplexity. They would 
have been still more puzzled if 
they had known what it was. 

McGill came down to Oyster 
Bay for the weekend and we 
played a game of gin rummy — 
a truly memorable game, because 
the cards behaved and I even lost 
a little. 

He congratulated me in a pre- 
occupied way, which annoyed me. 
“I should think you’d be gladder 
than that,” I told him. 

“I am,” he said. “But there’s 
something else — ” 

“What’s that?” asked Molly, 
worried. 

“The schools of fish are travel- 
ing head to tail. I’m wondering 
if that’s just the beginning of 
another mess.” 

We went back to playing gin 
rummy, but our minds weren’t 
on what we were doing. They 
haven’t been since. Just yester- 
day, an ocean liner chased its 
berthing tugboats away and went 
sightseeing up the Hudson River.
