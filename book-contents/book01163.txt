STRATEGY & TACTICS is a magazine. M's 
also a tool: a time machine that enables you 
to replay the crucial events — past, present, 
and lulure — that shape our lives, 

Now. instead ol merely reading about what's 
happening, you can explore and experience 
Ihe alternatives and decision pomts through 
the technique of Conflict Simulation 

What ia Conflict Simulation? 

Conflict Simulation is a way of analyzing a 
political or military conflict situation. A way 
that is as intellectually stimulating as a game 
ol chess, and as thorough as a wrilten analysis. 

Through the use ol (he Conflict Simulation 
(or "game") format, the conflict situation is 
re-created - so that you are in a position to 
make the vital decisions and, in the game at 
leasl. change the way things were, are. or 
will be. 

Whet you g«l 

STRATEGY&TACTICS magazine is publish- 
ed bi-monthly. Each issue contains: 

★ A ready-lo-play conflict-simulation game 
with a 22 x 28’ playing surface, die-cut play- 



ing pieces, and complete rules. 

★ An analytical article on the same subject as 
the game m that issue 

★ Other leature articles on historical and 
military subjects. 

★ Game and book reviews, commentary on 
existing games, and discussions of subscribers' 
questions 

The magazine is 48 + pages long, and all

Directions: 

In his letter in the January Directions 
Brent Higginbotham says, “Adventure, 
excitement, the old ‘sense of wonder’ 
need no rationalization. Even 
pornography need not be burdened with 
redeeming social value if it succeeds in 
what it sets out to do — titillate. ” 

Friends, comparing pornography to 
science fiction is like comparing a ring- 
toss to a moon shot. The craft involved 
in arousing a reader sexually has 
nothing to do with the art of writing 
worthwhile fiction. Neither does 
writing a good fight scene. Yet there is 
something to the comparison, although 
I doubt it is what Mr. Higginbotham 
had in mind: Just as the necessity for 
redeeming social value has hampered 
pornography for several years now, the 
requirement that science fiction be jam- 
crammed with action, thrills, Great 
Peril and good ole “sense of wonder ” 
has kept it in the cheapjack class oj 
literature in which it at least in part 
belongs. How many of the Great Books 
which command universal respect are 
fast-action thrillers? Middlemarch? Lit- 
tle Dorrit? Catcher in the Rye? 
Ulysses? 



The fact of the matter is that writing 
to give the reader his thrills is every bit 
as low as writing to give him titillation, 
and face it — only semiliterates read 
science fiction purely for the action. 
Yet “ action ” seems to be a science fic- 
tion tradition. Traditionalism in all 
forms is detestable, however. (A fine se- 
mantic point: traditions, of course, are 
not in themselves detestable at all, but 
those who insist that traditions are all 
that matter are. ) If traditions stuck in 
music (for example ) as many wish they 
would, composers today would still be 
sitting around rehashing Bach & Co. 

The same holds true for the scientific 
aspects of sf A. J. Budrys, in reviewing 
Chip Delany’s Nova a few years back, 
said something to the effect of: “As far 
as I can see, the most that science fic- 
tion can do is wring your heart while 
telling you how it works.” Talk about 
selling something short! That’s like 
saying Moby Dick is a story about a 
whale. How many real writers give a 
good goddam about blowing another 
hole in Euclidian geometry, or about 
taking time out from the hero’s 
psychological problems to show what 
happens to a micelle in colloidal 
dispersion? If , as a writer, you don’t 
have anything better to worry about 
you’re in the wrong business. 

Which brings us simultaneously to 
“relevance" and back to Mr. Higgin- 
botham’s letter. Once again he is right 
in a horribly mistaken way. Any sort of 
relevance is a passing thing. And, 
though it may pain many to hear it, 
Stand on Zanzibar, The Byworlder, 
The Sheep Look Up, Make Room!

JOHN BOYD 



Science had created the perfect man for 
a crowded planet. What was his mission? 
Could any power, anywhere, stop him?

PART ONE 



O N A bright morning in 
January Dr. John Heywood 
descended to his office in the De- 
partment of Experimental Genetics 
on the twentieth floor of the 
California Institute of Technol- 
ogy’s tower, bade his secretary a 
good morning and entered his 
private suite. As he started to 
remove his coat he glanced at the 
mail laid out on his desk and 
noticed an envelope with the return 
address: U.S. State Department, 
Bureau E. Heywood sat down 
without removing his coat. He 



reached for a letter opener hilled 



7 




with an ivory replica of Michel- 
angelo’s Statue of David. 

Two holographic computer cards 
fell from the opened envelope. Both 
were buff colored but one was 
edged with a black border. Inside 
was also a letter, amateurishly 
typed and written in an informal, 
familiar style at odds with the sud- 
den intensity of the man who read 
it. 

Johnny boy: 

Leave it to Cal Tech to corral 
all the oddball experiments! 

A corkscrew helix is coming 
your way from Baghdad. Amal 
Eugene Severn — The Ideal 
Man for a Crowded Planet — is 
transferring to the Cal Tech 
Seismology Department to 
study the San Andreas Fault. 

To refresh your memory — if 
a memory like yours ever needs 
refreshing — he’s the fourth of 
five prototypes in Ambulatory 
Eugenic Experiment Seven, so 
you should have a line on three 
of his creche mates before his 
own Thanatos Syndrome is 
triggered, which should be 
around May 1 since he’s pro- 
gramed to make the big 
contribution by the end of 
April. 

His white and black genetic 
cards are herewith. 

I hear the boys in the back 
room at Kiev have a betting 
pool on the self-termination 
date of their specimen, a gqnad 



grabber by the name of Ailya 
Eugenia Semenovna. Now 
that’s what I call scientific 
Russian roulette. 

Remember, Amal is our own 
baby, literally and figura- 
tively, so let’s keep him under 
our observation. The earth- 
quake boys might suspect 
something when Amal goes 
into action, but before any sus- 
picions congeal the human 
Mayfly will have flown, taking 
all evidence of the Thanatos 
Syndrome Factor with him. 

Speaking of the T. S. Factor, 
a whimsical- antiquarian on my 
staff tells me that “T. S.,” in 
World War II slang, stood for 
an expression which politely 
translates as “tough sugar” or 
“that’s all, brother.” 

You lucky stiff, 
Eddie 

Dr. Heywood took the letter, 
folded it and dropped it into a 
container attached to the side of his 
desk. The paper fell to the bottom 
of the container and evaporated. 
Then he fingered the panel board 
on a computer input box and stared 
for a moment at the screen. Lifting 
his phone, he dialed a number and 
said, “Doctor, you have a Nils 
Larsen in your class. Let me talk 
to him.” 

Heywood’s voice was flat and 
matter-of-fact as he spoke to the 
professor over the telephone. He 
waited a moment and when he 



8 



GALAXY 




spoke again his tone was vibrant 
and warm. 

“Good morning. Nils. This is 
Doctor Heywood. How would you 
like to brush up on your Arabic and 
move your living quarters to the 
sixty-plus floor level? Good! Call at 
my apartment at seven tonight. I 
have a proposal I’d like to explain 
to you. And by the way. Nils, keep 
this confidential. I’ll see you at 
seven.” 

Heywood hung up the phone and 
called in his secretary, to whom he 
gave the white card. “File this 
under los angeles area — 

TRANSIENT.” 

After the secretary left Heywood 
removed his coat and left his office, 
taking the black-margined card 
with him into a rear area of the 
wedge-shaped administration de- 
partment, which occupied a full 
eighth of the tower’s circle. He 
stopped at a tungsten steel safe and 
turned a combination lock, 
thinking of the betting pool set up 
by his Russian compatriots in Kiev. 
The Russians were free to bandy 
top-secret information among 
themselves — their Department of 
Human Engineering was a branch 
of the Soviet State Police. In the 
U.S. all academic departments of 
experimental genetics were an- 
swerable to the Eugenics Bureau of 
the State Department and were, in 
theory, subject to political 
jurisdiction. 

Envying the academic freedom of 
his Russian colleagues, Heywood 

THE DOOMSDAY GENE 



placed the unedited genetic index of 
Amal Severn into the black files 
and closed the safe. At Cal Tech 
only those with a need to know 
would be informed of the arrival on 
campus of one of the first five 
human beings programed from the 
fetal stage to accomplish much and 
to die young from a genetically in- 
duced self-destruct mechanism. 

N UANCES of form and color 
in the girl at the window 
matched those of the city spread 
below her in the February twilight. 
She, too, seemed fashioned of 
metal and minerals, an artifact of 
marble, spun gold and jade. 
Lissome, poised, square-shoul- 
dered, her body projected a regality 
not unlike the stateliness of the 
towers she looked out on and, like 
the beauty of the city, the beauty of 
the girl hid flaws. Behind Lyn 
Oberlin’s composed features and 
cool green eyes her mind stirred to 
a premonition as bizarre as it was 
emphatic. 

From girlhood her mind had been 
shadowed with precognitions, as if 
some inner eye glimpsed be- 
forehand the outriding shapes of 
the future. At times the shapes 
seemed very close, observing rather 
than being' observed. At such times 
her preternatural focus on the 
forms of the future became vaguely 
unsettling, as the sound of one’s 
heartbeat at night is a comfortless 
reminder of mortality. This evening 
her sense of something waiting was 

9 




so strong she found herself leaning 
toward the city. 

For over a hundred years the city 
had been called the city of the 
future. Shimmering above an ar- 
boreal plain between snow-capped 
mountains and the sea, its vari- 
colored towers resembled titanic 
minarets. Atop a central hill stood 
eight, all of yellow plastisteel and 
closely grouped in a circle linked at 
the fifty-floor level by an outward 
curving pedestrian tube. Topped by 
the knobs of mosque-domed res- 
taurants, the central towers were 
designed to resemble a crown of 
gold, for in Spanish the city had 
been named “the city of Our Lady 
the Queen of the Angels,” and the 
crown symbolized the diadem of La 
Reina de Los A ngeles. 

Even apart from the Moslem in- 
fluence on architecture symbolizing 
the city’s Christian origin, some 
critics considered the Los Angeles 
civic center overly flamboyant, but 
the major flaws of the city were in- 
visible. Beneath its basin and 
through surrounding hills ran 
earthquake faults: the Sylmar 

Fault, the Inglewood-Newport 
Fault, the Hollywood Fault. 
Slanting north and east of the city 
lay the great San Andreas Fault 
which in eons past had split a 
massive peninsula from the main- 
land, created an ocean gulf and, in 
an earlier century, destroyed the 
city of San Francisco. Here, too, 
the earth often trembled, but Los 
Angeles shimmered unmarred in 



the sunlight and glittered in the 
darkness. 

Turning from the window and 
going into her bedroom, Lyn 
Oberlin moved with a grace which 
inspired the average male liberal 
arts student to compare her with 
Diana, the Huntress — to the 
detriment of any romantic plans he 
might entertain. In the first place, 
Lyn detested cliches; secondly, once 
she had correlated a specific 
thought to a facial expression she 
could read a boy’s mind without a 
too intent study of his features. For 
a “mindreader” — her precognition 
sometimes seemed to take this 
form, but she always put the tetrn 
in quotes — flirting was as fas- 
cinating as playing poker with all 
the cards face up. 

For that reason her premonition 
was all the more bizarre. No doubt 
millions of young women, dressing 
for a ball, had thought with clair- 
voyant certainty. Tonight I’ll meet 
the man I’ll love and the man I’ll 
marry. Of those millions, she could 
safely assume, none had a sense of 
romance as jaded as her own. Aris- 
totle had said that to understand all 
was to forgive all, but the Greek 
had never been a coed in the 
Greater Los Angeles University 
Complex. Here, to understand all 
that went on in the mind of a 
student was to be bored, revolted, 
or terrified. 

Opening her jewel box, she stood 
for a moment in wonderment over 
her premonition. She was qualified 



10 



GALAXY 




by the Bureau of Eugenics to have 
two children, tax free, but marriage 
had never entered her plans. What 
husband could long tolerate a wife 
who could read his mind? 

At U.S.C., the only suitor Lyn 
had even idly considered was Red 
Benton, a graduate law student who- 
shared her interest in governmental 
procedures. Red’s thoughts were so 
aseptic, legalistic and complex he 
was rarely offensive, but she would 
not meet the U.S.C. student at the 
Cal Tech ball. 

She chose her grandmother’s 
locket watch from the jewel case. It 
balanced the V-neckline of the 
twentieth century miniskirt she 
wore as a costume. The pendant 
watch carried out the old-fashioned 
theme of the dress, which was 
daring for the neo-Victorianism of 
the younger generation but showed 
her legs to advantage. 

She snapped the locket behind 
her neck, wondering if her second 
invitation to the Cal Tech Scientists 
and Models Ball meant that the 
boys in the Daedalus Society plan- 
ned to ask her to model for one of 
their life-sized, computer-activated 
gynodrones. If so, she would refuse 
the honor. She preferred being 
thought of as prudish to the 
knowledge that a lifelike replica of 
herself would be cavorting through 
the halls of the men’s dormitories — 
on a rental basis — during the Sadie 
Hawkins Hour. 

Still drawn to the mystery of the 
evening, she turned from the room.

The long hiatus — as we , with 
enormous well-bred control, are calling 
it — is over. Random House now owns 
Ballantine Books — joy abounds. This 
department is back being over-worked 
as usual, and loving it. And may I, 
speaking personally, say thank you to 
all the many, many gentle persons who 
wrote, called and otherwise conveyed 
their love and good wishes while we 
were all cliff-hanging. The next episode 
in our soap-opera looks good. An s.f. 
editor must, in logic, be far-sighted 
enough to buy against futures. But or- 
ganizing the list for presentation at the 
Spring Sale Conference, we were 
rather astounded to find how well 
balanced we had, in fact, been. 



Two anthologies: THE ALIEN CON- 
DITION, Ed. Stephen Goldin— all 
original stories: and THE BEST S.F. OF

not unnaturally, the best already 
published material. 

Two New Writers: Robert Wells, 
with RIGHT-HANDED WILDERNESS; 
and Robert E. Toomey. Jr., with A 
WORLD OF TROUBLE. 

Two Old Masters: Lester del Rey —

lection); and TRULL/ON : Alastor 2262. 
by Jack Vance — the start of a brand 
new series.

And finally: Two STAR TREK books

That’s balance by God. Some are al-

Usually unschooled in mythology, 
science students were less apt to 
compare her to Diana and give her 
an immediate code to deciper their 
thoughts. For a while, at least she 
could indulge the illusion that she 
was a normal girl. 

B UOYANT, she emerged from 
her apartment into the circular 
corridor of the tower and pushed 
the elevator button for the parking 
basement. Twenty minutes later her 
enthusiasm was still with her when 
she parked her Dunemaster in the 
basement of the Cal Tech Tower 
and took the express elevator to the 
topmost floor and the students’ 
pleasure dome. 

The off-stage room where the 
guests awaited to be announced 
hummed with the voices of the 
feminine elite of the Los Angeles 
University complex, mostly 
describing their" reactions to 
receiving the invitations. Only two 
girls were familiar to Lyn. One was 
a male-centered redhead from 
U.S.C., a dramatics major named 
Gloria Jaffee whom Lyn did not 
particularly like but with whom she 
sympathized. Gloria was suffering 
a severe but immaculately 
concealed attack of stage fright. 

To calm her, Lyn engaged Gloria 
in conversation, telling her what to 
expect. “Be alert for surprises. Last 
year’s theme was the county fair. 
After a holographic square dance 
on the stage, the girl dancers faded 
but the boy dancers ran among the 



12 



GALAXY 




audience, kissing the girls. One girl 
fainted when a solid hologram 
kissed her. Of course, real boys had 
been dancing with the shadows.” 

The other familiar face was 
reassuring to Lyn. Last year the girl 
had been attired in the same 
costume she wore tonight, that of a 
Spanish gypsy with a mantilla on 
her hair. Lyn remembered her 
name, Lola Oachoa, because it pre- 
ceded Oberlin in the alphabetic 
order of introductions. A year had 
worked wonders with the girl’s 
torso. She was a transfer student 
from Madrid, Lyn remembered. 

The Spanish girl was introduced 
over the public address system im- 
mediately ahead of Lyn. She glided 
onto the stage with the grace and 
arrogance of a tango dancer. The 
ripple of urbane applause that 
greeted each guest rose to thunder 
as Lola Oachoa descended from the 
stage to choose her date for the 
night. 

Feeling absurdly provincial, Lyn 
answered her own call to the stage 
with a defiantly American stride. 
The decibel level of applause was 
considerably moderated until some 
boy broke the house rules with a 
wolf whistle. The tonic of the sound 
threw Lyn back to her normal walk 
and the applause rose to a higher 
peak. If she could have found the 
boy who whistled, she would have 
chosen him out of sheer patriotism. 

Descending into the arena, she 
walked among the tables to look 
over the offerings. Each table held a 



blond and a brunette for her to 
make her final choice between, but 
she needed a man to match her 
height and she preferred one with a 
guarded expression. Contact lenses 
were out in force tonight, she ob- 
served — the horn-rimmed status 
symbols of Cal Tech students were 
absent and the eyes above the 
bright table lamps glittered. Any 
ordinary girl could have read these 
boys’ minds by studying their neck 
muscles. 

Lyn paused. 

A BOY at a table was looking at 
. her with a bemused expression 
that suggested challenging thought 
patterns. He was tall enough for 
her — blond and broad-shouldered. 
A dueling scar could not have ad- 
ded to his aura of virility. Beside 
him sat a slender, dark-haired 
student with olive skin and incon- 
gruously gray eyes. He seemed as 
tall as the Teutonic knight, but his 
features were too sharp to be hand- 
some and he was slender. 

“I choose this table,” she said to 
them. “I’m Lyn Oberlin, a 
graduate student at U.S.C. In the 
morning I’m secretary to Doctor 
Kley. In the afternoons I’m a 
student and socio-psychological 
counselor at the clinic.” 

She spoke mostly to the dark- 
haired youth to add to the suspense. 
Her final choice would not be made 
until a bell rang. 

They arose, the blond speaking 
first, “I’m Nils Larsen, a genetics 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE 



13 




major from West Covina. At this 
table we prayed to two gods to 
guide your feet here. Amal, my 
roommate, is Mohammedan.” 

The dark boy came to attention 
and his heels clicked. ‘‘Amal 
Eugene Severn, seismologist, 
transfer student from Baghdad. We 
are honored.” 

Lyn decided she had selected the 
wrong boy as the student prince. 
The Arabian waited with haughty 
disdain as Nils Larsen seated her 
and turned the taple lamp low to in- 
dicate the table had been chosen. 

Amal Severn stood at attention 
until Lyn was seated — and when he 
sat he sat at attention. 

“You did seem preoccupied,” 
Lyn said to Nils, “but I had no idea 
you were praying.” 

“We started praying — Amal was 
chanting, really; he’s a part-time 
muezzin on a Baghdad minaret — 
the moment you started to stride 
across the stage, looking for all the 
world like Diana, the Huntress.” 
Scratch one blond beast, she 
thought and turned her attention to 
Amal. The Arabian seemed hyp- 
notized by the locket watch nestled 
in the cleavage three inches above 
the V in her blouse. Though slightly 
discomfited by his gaze, she smiled 
at him and said, “Let Amal speak 
for himself.” 

“We’re quite pleased,” Amal 
said in a clipped British accent. 

He kept his gaze on her locket. 
“You’ve studied at Oxford?” 
“Never.” 



“His father was English,” Nils 
volunteered. “His mother was 
Arabian.” 

The father accounted for the gray 
eyes so transparent they resembled 
windows opening onto vast deserts, 
but the eyes unsettled her with 
their steady gaze. 

“What are your hobbies?” she 
asked Nils. 

“Languages. I speak several. 
Amal’s are horsemanship and 
archery.” 

“I rather suspected Amal’s might 
be horology.” 

Amal tore his eyes from her 
watch and turned to Nils, speaking 
in Arabic. In profile, she noticed, 
he resembled a bust of Julius 
Caesar. Lyn understood one word 
and it was enough to tell her he was 
asking Nils the definition of 
horology. 

Nils answered him in Arabic and 
Amal turned to her. She caught a 
note of disapproval in his voice. “I 
was not looking at your watch.” 

“Amal comes from a part of Iraq 
where women still cover their 
faces,” Nils intervened, embar- 
rassed. “He’s only been in this 
country two weeks.” 

“Please tell Amal that my 
costume is designed to the specifi- 
cations of the ball committee.” 

“Be so kind as to speak to me 
directly,” Amal said. “I am not 
royalty.” 

He looked at her with a hauteur 
that made her wish he would return 
his gaze to her watch. Obviously he 



14 



GALAXY 




was suffering from advanced 
cultural shock caused by his 
transfer from Iraq to the United 
States and he might have been lying 
about his lack of royal lineage. He 
made her feel like a peasant. 

“I take it that you disapprove of 
my dress?” 

“Does it matter? I am not 
Allah.” 

One would never know it from his 
behavior, she decided. Something 
was going rapidly wrong with her 
premonition. She had chosen a 
table graced by a cliche user and a 
snob. 

S HE turned to Nils. He was be- 
ginning to look better. Despite 
the cliche, his thoughts were not yet 
obvious and he was handsome and 
mannerly. 

“What’s the theme of tonight’s 
spectacular?” 

“Reenactment of a Black Mass 
from the Middle Ages, complete 
with human sacrifices featuring a 
real human. A student depressed by 
his high B average, which is low for 
Cal Tech, is going to let himself be 
killed in plain view of the audience. 
If you’re not already a devil 
worshiper, get ready to be 
converted.” 

Lyn made a moue" of disapproval 
and Nils asked, “Aren’t you 
interested in the occult?” 

“Such ideas aren’t toys to be 
played with,” she said. “They can 
be dangerous. There are dark areas 
in the human psyche.” 



“You have thought about these 
things?” Amal surprised her with 
the question and the intentness with 
which it was asked. 

“My grandmother was a 
parapsychologist,” she said. “She 
taught me to withhold judgment on 
the so-called psychic phenomena.” 

“Come now, Lyn,” Nils said. “If 
you can’t weigh it or measure it, it 
doesn’t exist. So relax and enjoy the 
fairy tale.” 

“Some subjects upset me,” Lyn 
said. 

“Does violence disturb you?” 

“It does,” Lyn answered Amal’s 
strangely oblique question, “if the 
producer makes it seem real 
enough.” 

“Then I will be kind to inform 
you — ” Amal began, but Nils inter- 
rupted him, speaking in Arabic. 

Amal listened and shrugged, 
saying, “If that is your custom.” 

Amal had wanted to tell her 
something and Nils had given him a 
verbal kick in the shins. As if in 
apology, Amal turned to her and 
said, “May I offer you tea?” 

“Perhaps Lyn doesn’t like tea,” 
Nils said. 

“I will buy. She will drink,” 
Amal said. He clapped his hands 
above his head and a student waiter 
came running. Nils looked across 
the table as if embarrassed by 
Amal’s manner. Lyn smiled at him. 

“I will drink tea,” she told Nils. 

The Arabian’s hauteur was be- 
ginning to intrigue her. He was not 
handsome, but he was different and 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE

Nils seemed awed by him. Lyn’s 
interest was mostly clinical. She 
could get no impression of Amal’s 
thoughts — possibly he was thinking 
in Arabic. In any event, he had 
none of the openness of an 
American boy. He had the features 
of a desert hawk and the manners 
of a sheik, she thought, and he 
needed to be tamed as well as ac- 
culturated. 

Casually Lyn probed Amal with 
a seemingly innocuous question, 
actually one of the key questions 
used in socio-psychological interro- 
gation procedures. “Why do you 
study seismology?” 

“My mother was killed in an 
earthquake.” 

He answered with a vehemence 
that suggested a personal vendetta 
against temblors and was more sig- 
nificant to her than his expressed 
motive. On a Freudian level his 
emotionalism revealed Oedipal an- 
tagonisms toward the shaking 
earth, though a Jungian might 
assert that the earthquake sym- 
bolized Amal’s libido. Lyn had 
heard too many rumors about 
desert sheiks to discount the Jun- 
gians entirely. 

“Do you like this country?” Lyn 
asked. 

“It has been very generous.” 

“I take your answer as a diplo- 
matic ‘No,’ and if you’re having 
trouble adjusting to our culture, 
why not call on me professionally. I 
have an opening next Wednesday at 
three-thirty.” 



Her offer was genuinely given. If 
she decided to reject him when the 
bell rang she wanted to keep an op- 
tion to meet him later. He might 
merit a footnote on a paper she was 
planning on cultural shock. 

Amal neither agreed nor 
disagreed to her proposal. Instead 
he asked, “Is this Doctor Kley for 
whom you work the chairman of 
the board of supervisors?” 

“Yes,” she said and turned to 
Nils. 

“Why did you choose Cal Tech, a 
local school, when you had the 
whole country to select from?” 

“The genetics department here is 
the best. Doctor Heywood has a 
solid staff around him and genetics 
is where the action is.” 

They were interrupted by the 
waiter bringing tea and Lyn was 
grateful for a chance to change the 
subject. On her last outing at Cal 
Tech she had chosen a specialist in 
cosmic rays and he had bombarded 
her with talk of mesons. 

Lyn proposed a toast to their im- 
promptu fjost and the three touched 
cups at the center of the table. “To 
the junior Ozymandias, our seis- 
mologist, may his caravans be al- 
ways richly laden.” 

Her obscure allusion to a desert 
tyrant, taken from an English 
poem, would be accepted as a com- 
pliment by Amal, she felt sure, 
since he was a seismologist and had 
never been to Oxford. 

He responded promptly and with 
a flicker of a smile: “To the new 



16 



GALAXY 




Helen of Troy, our psycho-so- 
ciologist. May her watchtowers 
never topple.” 

She was immediately suspicious 
of his toast. Since he had been in 
the States long enough to learn that 
U.S.C. was called Troy, his 
twisting of “socio-psychologist” 
might have been deliberate. His 
further reference to her toppling 
watchtowers sounded more than 
faintly like a double entendre. 

Suddenly she was enjoying both 
of her table companions in a man- 
ner seldom permitted her. No banal 
thoughts from either had intruded 
on her mind. Toward Amal she 
reacted as a completely normal girl 
and all she could pick up from Nils 
was an occasional fit of dis- 
comfiture when he felt Amal was 
being too imperious. 

“It’s going to be hard to choose 
between you two,” she confessed. 
“I wonder if I could get a rules 
change and keep you both.” 

A 'CARAMBAl ” keened from a 
table across the aisle before 
either could answer and Nils turned 
to look back at the sound. From her 
position Lyn looked directly across 
and saw Lola Oachoa rise and spew 
Spanish at one of the boys at her 
table, apparently a Chicano. An 
Anglo, still seated, looked stupefied 
as Lola arched back in flamenco 
haughtiness, pointed to the stag 
area and told the Mexican, “Va- 
mose!” 



The boy stood up but did not go. 
He volleyed Spanish back at her 
and Nils, twisting his head side- 
ways, explained to Lyn that the boy 
was protesting Lola’s selection of a 
Gringo as a betrayal of Spanish 
honor. 

So recently buoyed by an 
American wolf whistle, Lyn sided 
with the patriot. Even more 
recently subjected to the hauteur of 
a sheik, she found that her sym- 
pathy went to the boy when, ac- 
cording to Nils’ rapid translation, 
Lola heaped aristocratic scorn on 
the Chicano she was rejecting. 

Finally she must have cast asper- 
sions on the Mexican’s virility, for 
he yelled, “Puta!” 

It was not a polite designation for 
a female either in Los Angeles or 
Madrid, but it must have been ac- 
curate, Lyn decided, for beneath 
the girl’s exterior beat the heart of 
a Spanish gypsy. Her hand whipped 
to the high comb in her hair, and a 
stiletto flashed. With a side-arm 
sweep, she swung the knife toward 
the boy’s rib cage. 

He threw out his palm, chopping 
her arm at the elbow, caught her 
wrist with his free hand and 
shortened the arc of the weapon. 
The stiletto plunged into a heaving 
bosom. Nearby, a girl screamed 
and Lyn relaxed, knowing no heart 
beat beneath Lola’s silicone 
mounds. Unseen by Nils, Amal had 
reached over and clasped her hand 
to gain her attention. Looking 
toward him, she saw him shake his

head to her in warning. The act was 
a part of the show. 

Masculine laughter drowned 
feminine shrieks as the wounded 
girl staggered into the aisle, 
stumbled forward, tripped lightly 
onto the stage and pulled the sti- 
letto from her chest. The blood 
flowing from the puncture swooped 
back into the wound. Holding the 
weapon in her hand, she made a 
sweeping bow as a voice sounded 
over the PA system: “Introducing 
Lola Oachoa, Cal Tech’s answer to 
Onan.” 

Lola hurled the stiletto into the 
planking of the stage and began a 
Mexican hat dance around it to the 
recorded music of a marimba. A 
gynodrone of metal and plastic, 
directed by a computer within the 
torso Lyn had envied, wove volup- 
tuous patterns on the stage, and the 
girl who modeled it, Lyn realized, 
might now be in a convent in Spain. 
Programed a little differently, the 
dark mannikin well might writhe to 
different rhythms at less public 
spectacles in this tower where 
certain students no doubt hoped its 
duties would be shared by a blond 
replica of Lyn Oberlin. 

Lyn was disgusted. At that 
moment she could have stalked 
from the hall, but she remembered 
the pressure of Amal’s hand as he 
had warned her of the spurious vio- 
lence. The Arabian might be 
haughty, but he was kind — and 
possibly he had not been at Cal 
Tech long enough to be tempted by 



the fabrications of the Daedalus 
Society. True, he was proud and ar- 
rogant, but training and natural en- 
dowments had equipped her to 
hood a desert hawk. 

Besides, it would be fun to tame 
him. The touch of his hand in hers 
had been strong, gentle and 
thrilling. 

A bell clanged through the 
pleasure dome. The time had come 
for the girls to make their final 
choices. 

Lyn stood and the two across 
from her arose to accept her formal 
announcement. “Gentlemen, I 
choose Amal Severn as my date for 
the evening.” 

“Thank you for considering me, 
Lyn,” Nils said. “My congratula- 
tions, Amal.” 

Amal went rigid, clicked his heels 
and said, “I am honored.” 

She had her work cut out for her, 
she decided, dating a boy who sat 
and stood at attention. She turned 
to Amal. 

“We’re not spending our evening 
in this computerized bawdy house 
watching a sophomoric Black 
Mass. I’m driving you into the 
country to show you something 
really spectacular. To hell with 
simulated realism.” 

She took his arm to escort him 
from the pleasure dome and a slight 
squeeze told her his muscles, 
though wiry, were as strong as 
corded cables. As they turned to go 
she caught her first coherent im- 
pression from the mind of Nils

Larsen, not a thought but an emo- 
tion powerful enough to. reach her 
at a casual glance. When they 
strode from the hall she knew she 
was creating history of sorts as the 
first girl to walk out of a Cal Tech 
Ball, but she was more concerned 
with the impression she had picked 
up from Nils. 

A strong but subtle feeling had 
reached her from his mind — a mix- 
ture of chagrin over his loss, a 
leaping hope for Amal and, deeper 
still, a great sadness too diffuse for 
her to pinpoint without staring at 
him.

** "D READ and circuses,” Amal 
U muttered, settling into the 
seat of the Dunemaster as it swung 
onto the freeway guide band. 

Inserting a routing card into the 
auto’s automatic steering com- 
ponent, Lyn looked over at him. 
“Bread and circuses?” 

“The gifts Nero used to keep the 
Romans happy,” he said. “Today 
it’s automobiles and spectaculars.” 
“I can’t complain about Nero,” 
she said, miffled by his conde- 
scension toward the automobile she 
treasured. “This car can climb 
seventy-degree slopes and if it flips, 
the cockpit stays upright. It has its 
own television set.” 

“You’ve got a burr in your right 
Venturelli nozzle,” he said, unim- 
pressed. “If you bore me tonight,

you can watch television while I file 
the burr from your nozzle.” 

Outside, he seemed much more 
relaxed than he had been in the 
pleasure dome. 

“At times,” she said, “1 almost 
think you have a sense of humor, 
but I’m not yet sure.” 

“You’re a psychologist. You 
should know — by insight. Tell me, 
can you really help the kooks?” 

“We never call the kooks 
‘kooks,’ ” she said. “And I can help 
them. Usually all they need is 
someone to talk to.” 

“What do you treat?” 

“Cultural maladaptation mostly. 
Many transfer students become 
depressed by their environmental 
shift.” 

“You mean they are homesick?” 
“Yes, but that term doesn’t dig- 
nify an ailment which, in extreme 
cases, can lead to suicide. I send 
some of my patients to simulated 
environments near San Bernardino 
which are modeled on their home- 
lands. If you ever get a craving for a 
burnoose or a camel give me a 
ring.” 

“Not until you’ve visited the tipis 
in the American compound in my 
country,” he said. 

“Oh, we have cowboys and In- 
dians here, too. Our historical re- 
search villages are widely used by 
scholars from all over the world.” 
They fell silent. He was intent on 
the passing towers of Civic Center 
bathed in klieg lights that obscured 
the moon. The only sound was the 



sibilance of wind over the cockpit 
dome and she studied his features in 
the glow from the Center. As im- 
mobile as a carving, his face 
conveyed an impression of a 
powerful, implacable will, but 
revealed not one iota of his 
thoughts. She could not have read 
his mind easily had he been 
thinking in English. In more ways 
than one he reduced her to the role 
of a typical American girl and she 
enjoyed it. 

He watched the blue tower of 
Echo Park and the silver tower of 
Silver Lake wheel by; he neither 
spoke nor made any attempt to 
move closer to her. Suddenly she 
feared she might lose this arrogant 
yet fascinating Moslem — his taste 
in females might be too exotic. 
Then she assured herself that her 
anxiety was premature. She had 
inserted the guide card to Yosemite 
Park on the theory that snow and 
water, by its novelty, should turn on 
a Bedouin. When they passed the 
Wilshire District tower and he had 
still said nothing she began to 
wonder if he might have felt more 
secure in the Mojave Desert. 

As the Dunemaster sped past the 
base of Hollywood’s purple tower 
he glanced up and she detected an 
expression on his face. “Don’t sug- 
gest we stop for a drink,” she com- 
mented. “Nice girls aren’t seen in 
the Hollywood Tower.” 

He had no such intentions. 

“A seven-point-five earthquake 
would send the pods popping off 



20 



GALAXY 




that stanchion like popcorn off a 
red-hot stalk.” 

S HE liked the simile and, with 
the memory of mesons bom- 
barding her brain, she wanted to 
avoid all talk of his specialty, but 
she could not let the implied slur on 
the city government pass. 

“Los Angeles is earthquake con- 
scious. Doctor Kley is very strict 
about enforcing our building 
codes.” 

“Then he should review the codes 
and do it quickly.” 

“Are you predicting an earth- 
quake?” 

“They are not yet predictable. 
But I’m working on it. At the 
moment I am having a problem 
with my model.” 

“Problems! Problems!” she inter- 
jected hurriedly, parroting the fa- 
vorite expression of Dr. Kley. 
“Have you visited this section of 
Los Angeles before?” 

“Farther north 1 hiked along a 
segment of the San Andreas Fault. 
It was — ” 

“It’s truly an interesting area. In 
a few minutes we’ll pass Old Fort 
Tejon— ” 

“I know. It was destroyed by a 
quake in — ” 

“Nearby is the Skinhead Re- 
servation.” 

“Skinhead. What an odd name.” 
She seized on the diversion, 
saying, “They shave their heads for 
religious reasons. It’s a protected 
cultural enclave where the women 



can have tax-free babies and 
ecologists can study the effect of 
population imbalance on the envi- 
ronment. I once wrote a paper on 
them. They are free of all city ordi- 
nances and Doctor Kiefer, their 
leader, used to teach economics at 
U.S.C. He’s so turned against 
technology he won’t even allow a 
radio on the preserve.” 

“They must be attractive 
people.” 

“Attractive? I wouldn’t get near 
one.” 

“Then how did you write a paper 
on them?” 

To keep his mind off seismology 
Lyn gave him a sprightly and 
detailed account of the me- 
thodology for writing a passable 
socio-psychological paper by 
abstracting data from other 
publications. 

“Then you write a paper about 
other papers.” 

“I — well, I refine concepts,” she 
explained, “and correlate pre- 
viously established data.” 

“Ah, so, ” he said and glanced at 
the moon. 

His look at the moon encouraged 
her and she fell silent, hoping he 
might move closer. Around them 
the winter-darkened hills of the 
Ridge Route began to rise in the 
moonlight. 

“This road crosses the San 
Andreas Fault three times,” he Fi- 
nally said. “If an earthquake broke 
the guide bands, cars would splatter 
like eggs among these boulders.”

“Yes, I’m sure. By the way, 
Amal — on your right is the Angeles 
Crest Hunting Preserve, second 
largest in the country.” 

“What is hunted?” 

“Deer, bear, elk, when the con- 
servationists release them. Con- 
demned criminals when they’re 
available.” 

“You hunt men in this country?” 
She was surprised by the disap- 
proval implicit in his tone. 

“Yes. To reduce tax assessments 
through the sale of hunting licenses. 
It’s quite fair. A criminal can 
choose between the hunting 
preserve and the gas chamber and 
only seven hunters are permitted to 
hunt at the same time. If he escapes 
to the skinheads he may be given 
sanctuary — if the skinheads don’t 
trade him for supplies.” 

“Nero was a humanitarian,” 
Amal said. 

“It’s not Nero’s bread and cir- 
cuses,” she said. “The idea is based 
more on William James’ ‘moral 
equivalent of war.’ One felon es- 
caped, then volunteered to ex- 
change himself for skinhead sup- 
plies, went in and escaped the 
second time. After that he was free 
until he committed another crime.” 
Amal glanced at the moon and 
said, “I envy that man. He accepted 
the challenge and won.” 

At least she had lured him away 
from earthquakes, she thought, 
though he had some strange ideas. 
She had never met anyone who 
criticized authority so quickly 



without quoting sources, though 
she did not expect him, a foreigner, 
to share her enthusiasm for the 
democratic process, particularly 
since he was so autocratic. On the 
other hand, he was alien and fas- 
cinating and, from the way his eyes 
kept flickering to the moon, he 
might be romantic. 

“Isn’t the moon beautiful 
tonight?” 

“Not while it’s there and we’re 
here.” 

“Why there and here?” 

“It’s directly opposite the sun 
relative to the Earth and the op- 
posite gravitational pulls exert a 
tidelike effect on the planet’s in- 
terior plasma, maximizing the 
strain on the Earth’s crust. I’ve rig- 
ged a device for measuring stress

S HE yielded. She would let him 
talk out his fears — did they 
constitute temblorphobia? She 
might at least get a paper out of this 
evening. 

Listening with half an ear she 
interrupted him only once — after he 
complained: “If I could get into the 
Cal- Edison moholes, I could install 
stress sensors on the fault lines 
seven thousand meters down.” 

“I could make arrangements to 
get you the permit,” she suggested. 

“If you could it might give me all 
the instrumentation I’d need to 
predict the next quake.” 

“I’ll use my influence,” she 
promised.

Using her influence, in this 
instance, meant pulling a request 
for a tour of the moholes from a 
filing cabinet and stamping Dr. 
Kley’s name at the bottom, but she 
refused to tell Amal because she did 
not wish to destroy the mystique of 
government administration. She 
wanted this young man, whose face 
was almost handsome by moon- 
light, to feel indebted to her. 

When in doubt grant a favor. Dr. 
Kley had always told her and Kley 
was her ideal politician. 

At the end of the guide band at El 
Portal, Amal’s enthusiasm had 
swept him closer to her — to 
demonstrate the coefficients of fric- 
tion between land masses — and she 
let him handle the wheel as they 



drove into the Park. Only then did 
he grow silent, awed by the majesty 
and wintry beauty of Yosemite. 

A thin skim of unplowed snow, 
freshly fallen, lay over the road 
between previously plowed banks 
and, as he drove beside the winding 
Merced, she commented on the 
ease with which he handled the ve- 
hicle even as he stared at the 
scenery. He seemed instinctively to 
adjust for curves and he was not 
driving at a snail’s pace. 

“My, you’re a good driver. 
Where did you learn?” 

“Dodging camel caravans in the 
streets of Baghdad,” he said and 
she detected irony in his remark. 

“You must think I’m terribly 
provincial?”

“How could I? I don’t know what 
‘provincial’ means. But if I wreck 
the car you’ll have to claim you 
were driving. I have no license.” 
“Why not?” 

“I’m not a citizen.” 

“That shouldn’t prevent a person 
from getting a driver’s license.” 

“It did me.” 

To permit him a view of the park 
she directed him in a circle past 
Wahanee Lodge, brightly lighted 
among the pines. Hearing music, 
she asked, “Do you dance?” 
“Superbly.” 

“Would you like to come back 
here and dance after I’ve shown you 
Bridal Veil Falls?” 

“No.” 

Well, that settled that, she 
thought. 

Above them, El Capitan and Half 
Dome reflected the moon’s glow 
onto the valley floor and diffused it 
in a mist of light through the snow- 
bent evergreens of the forest. En- 
tranced by the scenery and unable 
to suppress her enchantment, Lyn 
breathed a soft and reverent, 
“Wow.” 

He echoed her sentiments. “This 
is a lovely spot — as holy and 
enchanted as any beneath a waning 
moon ever haunted by an houri 
weeping for her Moslem lover.” 

His felicity of phrase after her 
simplistic expression left her 
vaguely chagrined as they parked at 
the foot of the path leading to the 
falls. She busied herself getting 
thermal coveralls for them both 



from the luggage compartment and 
soon they were garbed against the 
cold. Trudging ahead of her, Amal 
broke a path through the crust of 
the new snow toward the roar of 
the waterfall. 

Black in the moonlight, the water 
poured from a precipice high above 
them, its outer spray falling as 
snowflakes. The roar from the 
cascade precluded normal con- 
versation as they stood sharing the 
beauty in silence, but sharing it 
separately. Convention called for a 
kiss on this spot, but Amal did not 
even offer to take her hand. 

Covertly she studied his profile. 
In the line of his jaw, in the pred- 
ator’s nose was the feel of deserts. 
She could almost see the wheel and 
charge of Arabian horses beneath 
burnoosed tribesmen and hear 
above hoofbeats the war cries of 
Saracens. All Amal saw or heard 
was falling water. 

Cupping her hands toward his 
ear, she said, “They’re called the 
Bridal Veil Falls because the mist 
resembles a white veil. Do Arabs 
still take brides?” 

He cupped one hand to the side of 
his mouth and answered without 
looking down, “Only when they 
like to baby-sit.” 

“I heard Arabian men keep 
harems.” 

“I heard American girls prefer an 
androne called ‘Ken’ to living 
boys.” 

What he had heard was true but 
there was more. According to the 



24 



GALAXY 




most recent poll, girls in Lyn’s age 
group preferred the gynodrone. 
Barbie, over the androne, Ken. But 
this was no place to lecture a 
foreigner on the American system 
for maintaining a zero population 
growth. 

Suddenly he lowered his head and 
put his lips close to her earlobe. He 
smelled of cedar and sandalwood. 
“Let’s go. I’ve seen enough.’’ 

V 'EXED and disappointed, she 
turned and crunched through 
the snow ahead of him back toward 
the car, wondering if in Persia 
kissing girls was a taboo on the 
order of eating pork or wearing 
shoes in a mosque. As the roar 
from the falls receded she caught 
the strains of beginning music from 
the lodge and wished she had 
chosen Nils Larsen. 

Overtaking her, Amal said, 
“Thank you for bringing me. Yo- 
semite is perhaps the third most 
beautiful phenomenon I have ever 
seen.” 

His words were labored, spoken 
with difficulty, and she wondered if 
the altitude or the language 
bothered him. 

“Do tell,” she said with a hauteur 
he might never equal. “You must 
describe the first two on our way 
back to Los Angeles — while I 
watch television.” 

Putting his hand on the car door, 
he paused before opening it long 
enough to cause her to look up at 
him. Obviously, now, he was strug- 



gling to form his thoughts into 
English. 

“I cannot even describe Yosemite 
which is third most beautiful. How, 
therefore, could I describe the Vale 
of Shalimar, which is first in 
beauty, or Lyn Oberlin, who is 
second?” 

Impulsively she cupped his face 
in her palms and kissed lightly the 
lips which had not compared her to 
Diana, the Huntress. 

“Why, Amal, that’s the most de- 
lightful compliment!” 

For the first time he smiled. 
Rather, his expression was more a 
shamefaced, embarrassed grin, and 
she was as positive as she could be 
by moonlight that he was blushing. 
She was amazed at the novelty and 
at her own miscalculation — what 
she had assumed to be the haughty 
aloofness of a desert sheik was the 
brittle shyness of an inexperienced 
boy. 

Amal Eugene Servern was afraid 
of girls. 

“Amal, you’re blushing!” She 
laughed. “And I was beginning to 
think you disapproved of me.” 

“I have never been with a girl 
without a chaperone,” he 
confessed. “What do American 
boys say to a girl who is not a 
mathematician?” 

“If they’re very clever they tell 
her she’s a little less beautiful than 
the Vale of Shalimar and a little 
more beautiful than Yosemite. I 
hope you never learn to think in 
English.”

“But I do think in English.” 

He had finally opened the door 
and she slid into the cockpit. She 
was surprised by his remark. She 
had decided that her inability even 
to gain a glimmer of meaning from 
his facial expressions had been 
partly caused by the language bar- 
rier. Some other element in his 
psyche must be throwing his 
thoughts out of her focal range. 

“You must have been a very good 
student of languages,” she said. 

“Only of English and Hindi,” he 
said. “When I studied English it 
was almost as if I were re- 
membering my native tongue. It 
gave me an eerie feeling, beginning 
with my sense of familiarity with 
the alphabet, and sometimes I 
found myself remembering— or 
thinking I remembered — a word or 
phrase I had never heard before.” 
She found herself reluctant to 
start the motor. She was interested 
in what he said and she did not want 
their evening to end on a discord, 
however muted. 

“Memory auras are quite com- 
mon in older people,” she said “In 
the young they’re called deja vu.” 
“It’s more than an aura,” he said. 
“Sometimes I feel only a thin veil 
separates me from another life. At 
times I’ve used unfamiliar phrases, 
even Americanisms, that popped 
into my mind. Then, too, I’ve felt 
fragments of emotions that I should 
not feel.” 

“Have you ever spoken to a 
psychologist?” she asked. 



“Only to you,” he said. “I did not 
wish to be considered crazy. 
Tonight, when you spoke of dark 
areas of the mind, I felt that you 
might understand. Besides, I know 
that the ethics of your profession 
forbid you to speak of secrets.” 

All he said was true and quite 
perceptive. His secrets would be 
protected by her, not only because 
of ethics but of law. Her own mind 
held mysteries, but unfortunately 
she could not confide in him with 
immunity. 

“Are you troubled with 
nightmares or recurring dreams?” 
“When I was a boy I used to 
experience one dream a lot,” he 
said, “but it was far from being un- 
pleasant. I dreamed I introduced 
my father to my creche mother and 
they fell in love.” 

His dream was neither Oedipal 
nor uncommon, she recognized. 
Children often preferred the women 
who bore them to their genetic 
mothers. 

S HE could not speak as freely to 
him as he to her, but an under- 
standing of his problem might help 
her understand her own, if she 
could overcome his shyness and 
keep him with her a while longer. 
The distant music gave her an in- 
spiration. His hand lay beside her 
on the seat and she reached over 
and placed hers over it, looking at 
him pleadingly. Her touch was 
designed to reassure him and her 
look to give him ego confidence.

“Amal, they’re dancing at the 
lodge. If it’s not against your reli- 
gion— would you take me there 
tonight?” 

She was following the recom- 
mended procedure for dealing with 
sexual timidity — a bashful person 
should be given a line of retreat. He 
could use religion as a reason to 
refuse her, but she had caught him 
in a moral and emotional vise. A re- 
fusal would be tantamount to 
deserting a friend. 

‘‘In the creche,” he stammered, 
“we were taught to dance hori- 
zontally. You Americans dance 
vertically.” 

She squeezed his hand 
reassuringly. “I studied classical 
dancing in high school. Maybe we 
can manage together.” 



Her use of the word “we” was 
designed to establish familiarity 
and a sense of joint purpose. 

“It would be my pleasure to join 
with you in a dance,” he said. The 
stilted formalism in his answer sug- 
gested to her that he had been 
reared in a sexually segregated 
creche. 

“Would you care to drive?” 

“You betcha!” he said. She did 
not understand the term “betcha,” 
but assumed it was an Arabic 
expression of enthusiasm. 

They entered the lodge. She 
realized that she had forgotten she 
wore the costume of another 
century under the thermal jacket 
she peeled off in the cloakroom. 
The Saturday night crowd in the 
ballroom, mostly collegians, also

reminded her as she followed the 
head waiter across the dance floor 
backlighted by a now empty band- 
stand. Apparently unruffled by the 
cheers and whistles, Amal seated 
her at the table at the edge of the 
dance floor from which the waiter 
removed a reserved sign. She 
would have preferred a more ob- 
scure table and less deference from 
the waiter, but Amal, strangely at 
ease, seemed to expect the attention 
that drew the unvoiced envy of the 
patrons surrounding them. 

Scanning the faces of the females 
closest to them, reading their 
thoughts, Lyn realized that Antal's 
shyness was in no way created by 
feminine rejection. To a person as 
perceptive as he was proving to be. 
Ins altracliveness for the opposite 
sex would be apparent. As he 
studied the wine list, the waiter at- 
tentive lieside him, she was struck 
lt\ iin idea so giotesrpie the ab- 
Miidity of Us logic held her. Could 
Amal have been conditioned to 
sexual constraint? She knew 
shyness was easily induced in the 
human psyche — one rebuff to a 
sensitive child could make him or 
her self-restrained as an adult. 

She glanced up and saw at a 
glance that the waiter, too, was 
engrossed in puzzlement — how did 
this young man rate a State De- 
partment green credit card? 

How, indeed? Lyn’s thoughts 
veered to the new mystery. Having 
preceded him at the entrance she 
had paid no attention to his credit 



card, assuming it to be the pink 
card of the ordinary transfer 
student. Green cards of unlimited 
credit were issued by the State De- 
partment to ambassadors, visiting 
heads of state, heirs of royal houses 
and other very important persons. 

Amal had said he was not 
royalty, but the statement could 
have been a modest disclaimer. He 
could be related to an oil sheik and 
conditioned to shyness to preclude 
his involvement with girls of the 
commonalty. The idea was worth 
investigating. 

Amal asked her deferentially if 
he might recommend the Thracian 
Andros and she said she would be 
delighted. He handed the wine list 
to the waiter who scurried away. 
Without the menu to distract him 
he seemed ill at ease and she under- 
took to lead the conversation. 

“I didn’t think Moslems used 
alcohol.” 

lie smiled. “My Moslem ism was 
Nils’s idea of a joke, so I went 
along with him. Actually I’m 
Coptic Christian.” 

I ESS familiar with Coptic Chris- 
* tians than with Thracian An- 
dros, she changed the subject. 
“How did you come to select a 
geneticist as a roommate?” 

“Oh, I’m not a bigot. He wanted 
someone to practice Arabic with 
and I need a housekeeper and a 
handyman. So I took him in.” 

His smile took the edge off his 
implied bias and she noticed his 



28 



GALAXY 




speech was growing more relaxed. 
He was beginning to feel at ease 
with her. 

“For once I’m overwhelmed by 
the service at the Wahanee,” she 
ventured. “Did someone whisper to 
the waiters that you were the son of 
a shah?” 

“It was you who impressed 
them.” 

“I’m not that conspicuous. One 
would think you had a green credit 
card.” 

“So you noticed,” he said. “With 
me it’s not a status symbol. My ex- 
periments are considered im- 
portant, so your government gave 
me the green card to let me finance 
my research without the delay of 
applying for grants.” 

She knew a scholastic grant 
rarely took longer then two weeks 
to process. His experiments must 
have a very high priority if they 
were pursued with such urgency. 

“Aren’t they afraid you might 
buy a yacht and sail to Tahiti?” 

“Whoever ‘they’ are, they knew 
I’d never have thought of doing 
so — until I met you. I lead a 
monastic and dedicated life, very 
humdrum except for those unre- 
called memories and a few strange 
urges.” 

“What strange urges?” she 
asked, but the waiter had come with 
the wine, pouring Amal a sip and 
standing back. 

Amal tasted it. 

“Waiter, this wine is processed, 
not aged. Greeks feed this swill to 



their pigs. Haven’t you any 
naturally aged wine?” 

“Let me check again, sir,” the 
waiter said and Lyn, glancing up, 
saw that he was thinking: / would 
try to palm it off on a 
connoisseur . 

Lyn was amused by the waiter’s 
chagrin, but Amal turned to her 
apologetically. “I’m sorry to have 
to berate him in your presence, but 
he would have charged me for more 
expensive wine and I must protect 
your government’s money.” 

“You find such deceit, now- 
adays,” she said, “even while 
honesty’s praised as the chief 
virtue.” 

“The dishonest preach honesty to 
gain an advantage over the 
trusting,” he said. “Still, I’d rather 
trust ten dishonest men than dis- 
trust one honest man.” 

His thoughts seemed to move in 
deeper channels than those of 
American boys, she observed, but 
she was beginning to admit a preju- 
dice toward Amal. 

“What are your strange urges?” 
she repeated. 

“They’re weird,” he said. “I’ll be 
intent on my work when suddenly 
I’ll be shaken by a feeling that I 
should be somewhere else, testing 
truths that will test me. It’s more 
than a feeling. It’s a knowledge, 
certain, factual. I often imagine I’m 
a puppet, dangling on the wrong 
strings, in the wrong puppet show, 
before the wrong audience.” 
Concealing a certain feeling of 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE

self-recognition, she remarked, 
“Perhaps it’s your isolation. It’s 
positively abnormal that you’ve 
never been alone with a girl.” 

“Not for a boy from a Coptic 
creche,” he said. “We met our 
creche sisters only on formal occa- 
sions and we were trained to treat 
them as visiting royalty. Meeting 
you, an American girl, fissured my 
fault lines.” 

“No wonder.” She smiled. “You 
must have gained a distorted im- 
pression of girls.” 

“Oh, I had my creche mother, a 
gracious and beautiful woman. She 
devoted most of her attention to me 
after my father and mother were 
killed. But I lost her when I was 
fourteen — in the great Iranian 
quake.” 

She tried to divert him from an 
obviously unpleasant memory. 
“Were you injured in the quake?” 

“No. I was in Baghdad. Mother 
was lying-in at an Iranian Coptic 
creche. The entire creche fell into a 
fissure. The fools in Baghdad didn’t 
keep the newspapers from me with 
all the lurid details. For a while I 
was shattered. It was then I decided 
to try to find a method for pre- 
dicting such catastrophes.” 

Whether he knew it or not he had 
outlined to her, step by step, a 
classic example of Pavlovian condi- 
tioning which had forced him into 
the study of seismology. The re- 
moteness of the opposite sex had 
brought him closer to a beautiful 
and idealized mother-figure — who 



was swallowed by the planet. The 
mythos was almost more than 
Lyn’s credo could accept. She was 
vaguely aware that intrigue was still 
practiced in the Middle East. Amal 
might have been conditioned to be- 
come obsessed with earthquakes in 
order to deprive him of his 
inheritance in some oil sheikdom. 
Of course the idea was absurdly 
romantic, almost as far-fetched to a 
psychologist as the idea that fate, 
itself, was purely Pavlovian. 

“No wonder you would like 
another set of memories,” she said. 

“But the memory I spoke about 
has nothing to do with my life or 
times.” 

T HE waiter returned with 
another bottle of wine, ceremo- 
niously wiping off the dust in their 
presence. The vintage passed 
Amal’s test. It was a dry wine, 
flavored slightly with licorice. Lyn 
voiced her appreciation for it, 
though for all she knew it could 
have been one week removed from 
the Napa Valley. 

Her own life had been shadowed 
by rare and inexplicable episodes 
wherein she could see visions so 
acute they frightened her. It might 
help Amal to know that others 
passed through dark areas, but 
reticence had become ingrained in 
her. He was not bound by law or 
ethics to preserve her confidences 
and there were areas to her own — 
neuroticism? — that she would have 
to hold inviolate if only to protect 



30

his opinion of her. But he had con- 
fided in her, saying he could not 
risk distrusting an honest man. 
Morally she was wrong to distrust a 
man who trusted her — and by con- 
fiding a little she might reassure 
him much. 

“Amal, I’ll confess a secret, too,” 
she said abruptly. “I knew you had 
a green card because I read the 
waiter’s mind.” 

“From his attentiveness?” 

“More than that. By studying his 
face. I can read a person’s complete 
thought units, not verbally — few 
thoughts are verbalized — but when 
they are strongly amazed or Upset 
their thoughts come to me through 
their facial expressions.” 

“Oh, come, Lyn. Such things are 
as impossible as — as a dual 
memory.” He smiled, speared by 
his own logic. “Can you 
demonstrate your ability?” 

“I confess that with you I can’t. 
At first I thought it was because 
you were thinking in Arabic. Now I 
don’t know what it is. But you defy 
me.” 

“Let’s test you,” he said. “Study 
my face carefully and I’ll verbalize 
a very important message to you.” 
“My gaze might frighten you.” 

“I don’t scare easily. Study me 
now.” 

She focused her vision on him 
openly, tuning her mind to receive 
every nuance of expression in his 
face. All she garnered from the man 
across the table was a sensation of 
whirling energy. She felt herself on 



the edge of some vast, dark 
maelstrom and it was she who 
looked away. Her receptors had 
picked up nothing of what he was 
thinking. 

She brought her eyes into normal 
focus and confessed her failure. 

Fully at ease now, he smiled. “I 
was rearranging in my mind the 
order of the three greatest wonders 
of my world. When were you first 
aware of your gift?” 

“ ‘Gift’ is hardly the word.” She 
smiled. “As I discovered to my sor- 
row in the first grade when I started 
answering my classmates before 
they asked questions. They accused 
me of being a witch and one 
afternoon a group of the more 
active girls surrounded me on the 
playground and tried to stone me. 
The little dears had heard that 
stoning was the way to destroy a 
witch. I broke through their circle 
and outraced them, but not before 
they had taught me to keep my 
mouth shut. The irony of it was that 
a decade later witchcraft became 
fashionable in the elementary 
school set. By then they would have 
made me den mother of a coven.” 
He reached over to squeeze her 
hand. “You can smile now, but the 
experience must have been shat- 
tering to the little girl you were.” 

T HE concern in his voice 
touched her so deeply she al- 
most lost her composure, but his 
gray eyes steadied her with their 
strength and calmness.

“Oh, that was only a part of it. 1 
was spared the full shame of os- 
tracism because shortly thereafter 
my parents moved to the West 
Coast. But eight years later my 
class was given the secondary- 
school placement profile tests. The 
segment of the tests concerning the 
psi factor, relating to telepathy and 
clairvoyance, was conducted by a 
parapsychologist. He was espe- 
cially concerned about my 
answers — I knew this from reading 
his mind — so I became particularly 
concerned to give him the wrong 
answers. When he looked them 
over I could read his' disap- 
pointment and the thought: Well, 
they’re wrong again. 

“A moment ago you spoke of 
puppets. Are ‘they’ pulling the 
strings? Or is it paranoia that leads 
me to ask? I don’t think so, particu- 
larly now that I’ve talked to you, 
but at times I considered that I 
might be a kook. Probably that’s 
why I studied psychology, to learn 
more about my own mind, and ob- 
tained a job with the government, 
the better to be able to discover who 
‘they’ are.” 

Am al nodded and said. “It’s as if 
‘they’ were waiting for you to show 
up — and you failed to keep your 
appointment?” 

“That was precisely my im- 
pression.” 

“Maybe you’re the implant 
daughter of a medium and the 
parapsychologist had been alerted.” 

“No. My own mother bore me. I 



come from a long line of child- 
bearing women. And my parents 
could have told no one. Their rela- 
tionship was undergoing a strain at 
the time, so I kept my secret from 
them. Knowing their thoughts, I 
didn’t wish to be a tale-bearer 
between them.” 

“That situation itself must have 
been a burden to a child.” 

“And after it the burden of trite 
thoughts foisted on me by 
associates, particularly ardent 
young men whose intentions and at- 
titudes so often belie their words. 
So I’m thrilled indeed not to be able 
to demonstrate my ‘gift’ to you.” 

Beyond the dance floor the 
orchestra was returning. Glancing 
over, Amal said, “With luck and 
help from the band leader I may be 
able to prove to you my freak 
memory. 

Rising, he took her hand and led 
her across the floor, moving with an 
ease that left her doubting her own 
theories. If he had been intensely 
conditioned to shyness, his timidity 
would not h&ve been neutralized by 
a single moonlight ride with a girl. 
Such traits induced into a per- 
sonality were overcome only by 
some wrenching emotional stress — 
rage, fear, despair — or by months 
of counter-conditioning. 

At the podium a gray-haired con- 
ductor looked down and repeated 
Amal’s request as if doubting it. 

“A medley of dance music by 
early American composers?” But 
he said, “My pleasure, sir — ” and

Turning to Lyn, Amal said, 
“This shouldn’t be difficult for you. 
I’m a strong leader.” 

A strong leader with a superb 
sense of rhythm, and their heights 
matched. No one booed when he 
swung her onto the floor. She was 
familiar with the movement of the 
waltz from her classes in in- 
terpretative and classical dancing, 
but a novice would have had little 
difficulty. Dancing with Amal was 
an effortless gliding into the swirls 
and dips of the waltz. 

The orchestra bridged between 
airs and swung into a new segment 
of the medley. Amal held her closer 
and breathed into her ear a phrase 
she assumed was an Arabic term of 
endearment, “Begintha begeen!” 



No one joined them on the 
floor — the crowd remained seated, 
watching them in silence. Someone 
dimmed the house lights and a spot- 
light in the rafters was focused on 
them, cutting from their view the 
orchestra and the faces in the dark. 
In the cone of light they had only 
themselves and the music as he led 
through a tango, making her feel as 
weightless as a spinning, falling leaf 
controlled by an autumn breeze. As 
the music ended Amal swung her 
into a deep bow, catching and 
holding her on the final note, and 
the leaf had landed on a pool of still 
water. 



A PPLAUSE sounded as the 
lights came on. Straightening,

they bowed in appreciation, both 
realizing that the audience, unfa- 
milar with the dance, had assumed 
they were exhibition dancers. 

The band swung into The 
Berkeley Bounce, and the vertical 
dancers poured onto the floor. 
Tacking back to their table, 
guarding her face from an exu- 
berance of elbows, Lyn grieved for 
the ancient graces. After the Ho- 
locaust and two generations of zero 
population growth there was no ne- 
cessity left for up-and-down 
dancing, but the old space-saving 
customs lingered. 

At a table so close to the dancers 
that conversation was difficult 
above the thud of shoe soles on 
hardwood Amal clarified the 
phrase Lyn had mistaken for an 
Arabic term of endearment. 

“Accept on faith that I know lit- 
tle about music and less about 
American composers. But the name 
of one of the melodies in the medley 
popped into my mind. I’ve never 
heard the title before, yet I’ll wager 
that if you check the library tomor- 
row, you’ll find listed an American 
dance, Begin the Beguine.” 

“We can test your memory in the 
parking lot. My Dunemaster has a 
telephone. We can call the in- 
formation bank.” 

“Shall we go? Our position here’s 
perilous.” 

She wanted to be alone with him 
and it was true that their table was 
in danger from the leaping dancers, 
but she was impelled to remind 



him, “What about the govern- 
ment’s investment in Thracian 
Andros we’re protecting? We’ve 
hardly touched it.” 

He grinned and revealed an un- 
mistakable sense of humor, irony, 
and perhaps more. He said, “Let’s 
leave it to the waiter as a reward for 
his honesty — he can recap it and 
sell it as an untouched bottle. 
Besides, I no longer need a social 
crutch.” 

His shyness had vanished so com- 
pletely that she wondered if it could 
have been overcome by an emotion 
as strong as — but less negative 
than— anger, despair, or fear. Her 
thought smacked of vanity, she 
realized, but the idea warmed her as 
they suited and ran through the 
snow toward the car. 

Inside the cockpit she felt an ab- 
surd and fluttering shyness as she 
pulled off her jumpshit to store it in 
the compartment. Merely the mo- 
tion of undressing in his presence 
gave her virginal tremors, a thrill 
she was technically entitled to. For 
all his expression revealed, Amal, 
pulling off his jumpsuit beside her, 
could have been in a locker room of 
the boy’s gym, an observation that 
proved a fact she had long ago de- 
duced, that the better part of ro- 
mance was mystery and that 
Tantalus, not Eros, should have 
been its god. 

She set the telephone for a 
conference call and dialed the in- 
formation bank. Leaning forward, 
she spoke slowly, enunciating each

syllable carefully, “Music. Ameri- 
can. Song title. Begin the 
Beguine. " 

After a three-second delay, a 
recorded voice answered, “Com- 
poser, Cole Porter. Published, 
nineteen thirty-four.” 

She looked toward Amal and 
said, “Congratulations. Your 
American memory reaches back 
more than a hundred years.” 

“Ask it if there’s a historical 
figure named Baby Ruth.” 

She asked and the bank replied, 
“There is no historical Baby Ruth.” 
“Baby Ruth is another 
expression that broke through to 
me when I was a boy in Baghdad,” 
he explained. “It might have been 
the name of my sister who never 
distinguished herself. What hap- 
pened in the U.S. in nineteen 
thirty-four?” 

History was not Lyn’s strong 
point, but she felt it was ungracious 
of her not to answer a foreigner’s 
question about her country. “Some 
event of the first magnitude,” she 
said hesitantly. “I think we either 
exploded an atom bomb or landed a 
man on the moon. But let me 
check. American history. First 
magnitude events. What happened 
in nineteen thirty-four?” 
“Nothing,” the mechanical voice 
replied. 

“Second — or any magnitude?” 
“Year of the Great Economic 
Depression which saw the con- 
solidation of the theory of govern- 
mental paternalism under the 



presidency of Franklin Delano — ” 
She hung up, saying, “It could go 
on like that for hours, piling statis- 
tics on statistics. The city maintains 
historical periods in villages south 
of San Bernardino to permit re- 
search historians and antiquarians 
to absorb such trivia painlessly.” 

A MAL seemed not to be listen- 
b. ing. His face held a look 
of intent vacuity, as if his mind 
were focused on wonderment. Al- 
most to himself he said, “It could 
have been then.” 

He glanced at her, his mind ob- 
viously returning to the present, 
and said, “All night I’ve had a 
feeling that I met you before. I 
wonder if you were there. You re- 
mind me of an old-fashioned girl.” 
“It’s probably my polka-dot 
dress, unless you’re willing to ac- 
cept the theory of reincarnation.” 

“I prefer statistical proba- 
bilities,” he said. “A million 
monkeys making marks at random 
would eventually rewrite the 
Koran.” 

“That’s not exactly the way I 
heard it.” She smiled, moving 
closer to him. His arm was across 
the back of the seat and she was al- 
most under it, pretending to pout. 
“If I had known you in nineteen 
thirty-four I would not have forgot- 
ten you in a mere century and a 
half.” 

He didn’t move his arm down to 
comfort her. 

“Of course it wasn’t you, but you

do seem to bring back a memory of 
emotion, evasive, indefinite, but 
strangely compelling.” 

“Describe it,” she commanded. 

“There’s a sadness to it.” His 
voice held a strange resonance — his 
eyes looked far away. For a 
moment she feared he was slipping 
into a trance. She shuddered. But 
he had merely been struggling to 
express the emotion in words. “It’s 
a feeling of mild despair like the 
memory of a lost love, but there’s a 
sense of triumph mixed with it, of 
having won something sought for — 
yet really not wanted. 

“I’ll describe the emotion in a 
parable,” he said, suddenly alert. 
“Once in the past I loved a girl who 
rejected me for a suitor with better 
prospects. Years later I returned to 
the place of my birth to learn that 
the young banker whom my 
sweetheart married was in jail for 
embezzling bank funds . That’s 
it — a sweet sadness mixed with a 
sad triumph.” 

She laughed at his strangely suc- 
cessful, though involved story and 
said, “You can always go back to 
nineteen thirty-four. It’s on the 
subway to Hemet. For instant nos- 
talgia, there’s always Disneyland.” 

“It’s not nostalgia,” he said, 
taking her quip seriously. “I would 
be searching for my own memory. 
Say, Lyn, would you go back with 
me? I would like to court you — old 
style.” 



“Ye gods! Back in those days it 
took weeks for a boy to get up 
courage enough even to kiss a 
girl — and the women were too 
subjugated to kiss first.” 

“So what? That would be about 
my speed. Besides, the Epicureans 
held that bread was a feast for a 
hungry man. What wouldn’t a 
starving fellow like me do with a 
lavish banquet — like you?” 

She laughed. “Going to those 
places, even after hours and on 
weekends, costs money. Most of 
the researchers are there on 
grants.” 

“I have a green card. I could pay 
your way.” 

“Oh, no,” she said. “I might be 
an old-fashioned girl but I’m no- 
body’s old-fashioned mistress.” 
“See? You belong back there,” 
he chortled. “Already you’re wor- 
ried about your virtue. I know you 
American girls believe in equal 
responsibilities and equal privi- 
leges, but I’m willing to pay you as 
a psychologist.” 

“I work in a free clinic,” she said. 
“And I haven’t got my doctorate. 
Still, you have a valid problem. 
And it’s true — in the ambience of 
that time period you might, have 
your memory restored.” 

She had enough self-awareness to 
recognize that she was working 
around to an agreement as she 
continued thoughtfully, “As a 
psychologist observing a committed 
patient I might pull a few strings 
and get a discount from the His- 



36 



GALAXY 




torical Artifacts Association. You 
call on me during my open session, 
Wednesday. By then I’ll have your 
permit to enter the moholes and we 
can plan to investigate your fixation 
on the past.” 

His arm came down from behind 
her. He took her hand and kissed it 
in a circumspect and formal gesture 
of gratitude which nonetheless held 
a promise. Once she had overcome 
his shyness she knew he might 
relieve the tedium of the twentieth 
century in a spectacular manner. 

“I’m paying my own way, Amal. 
That’s definite. And I can’t afford 
to give you more than three weeks’ 
wooing time.” 

Ill 

t YN’S initial reaction to the his- 
* torical village, Dotham, Ala- 
bama, circa 1934, was hostile. After 
she arrived at the replica of a rail- 
road station and changed into pe- 
riod dress in the station’s dressing 
room she almost sprained an ankle 
trying to tote her suitcase across the 
waiting room in the high-heeled 
shoes of the era. She compounded 
her aggravation by calling the 
redcap who came to her aid 
“mister.” With some embar- 
rassment he corrected her error in 
the customs and traditions of the 
Old South. The error should never 
have occurred after all the reading 
she had done in Gone with the 
Wind in her Era Acculturation 



Class given by the Historical 
Society. 

The town itself seemed static. 
The low wooden and brick 
buildings grouped around the 
square — a wooded plot featuring, 
of all things, the statue of a 
soldier — resembled boxes. These 
structures gave her none of the 
feeling of movement she got from 
the plastic towers of Los Angeles. 
A few citizens, mostly black, 
lounging on the station platform 
and the sidewalks contributed- to 
the indolence of the scene. To the 
right, down the sidewalk, the 
marquee of an old-fashioned movie 
house, advertising Jean Harlow in 
The Red-Headed Woman, bla- 
tantly proclaimed its name: The 
Empire. Apparently “imperialism” 
was not a revolting word in 1934. 

Balanced on the high heels, her 
breasts constricted into a shoulder 
halter, she had to wait twenty 
minutes in front of the station for a 
taxi, a boxlike vehicle decorated 
with garish black and white 
checkers, which clattered to the 
curb, its motor coughing in ter- 
minal throes. With the driver’s aid 
she clambered up the footboard 
into the cab to discover its air-con- 
ditioning was au naturel — one 
raised or lowered a window. She 
had gotten Dr. Kley’s permission to 
leave work early in order to greet 
her patient in the village when he 
arrived into a strange envi- 
ronment — but if the taxi service 
had not improved by 5:00 p.m. 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE

Amal would have to acclimate 
himself to his new surroundings 
without her professional assistance. 

Beyond the business district, the 
taxi bore her through an area of 
white wooden houses with wide ve- 
randahs, set well back on tree- 
shaded lawns. The residential area 
seemed somnolent. It was an in- 
credible fact to her, but she had 
been told that 60 percent of the in- 
habitants of this village, where the 
calendar was set back to 1930 at the 
end of each decade, were 
permanent defectors from the 
twenty-first century. 

The Emerson’s house, Lyn’s 
destination, was twice isolated. It 
stood a half-mile beyond the 
pavement’s end on a road that 
wound through trees, bridged a 
creek and curved north. Beyond a 
hedge, where a mailbox marked a 
gap in the hedge wall, the house was 
further concealed by a cluster of 
myrtle bushes. 

The taxi driver carried Lyn’s bag 
to a porch where a missing ban- 
ister was scarcely noticeable — the 
whole house stood in need of a new 
coat of paint. But the Emersons, 
summoned to the porch by the rat- 
tle of the taxi to greet their new 
boarder, appeared to stand aloof 
and apart from the shabbiness of 
their residence. 

Mr. and Mrs. Emerson were in 
their fifties, thin-faced and angular. 
Both were tall. The woman wore a 
black dress with long sleeves, the 
man overalls and a blue denim shirt 



with a high collar. From her 
briefing in Los Angeles, Lyn knew 
the Emersons were literary his- 
torians finishing up a two-year 
grant in Dotham. They had come to 
study the origins of science fiction, 
a remote literary excrudescence 
which had frothed briefly to the sur- 
face of twentieth-century literature 
before it was scummed off by scien- 
tific advances which had turned the 
genre’s romantic conjecturings into 
low-comedy realism. 

Lyn’s room was the crowning 
disappointment of her day. Bare- 
floored, except for the oval rag rug 
beside a bed that held a hard mat- 
tress on creaking springs, the room 
was decorated by wall-paper that 
repeated endlessly a single rosebud. 
Lynn found a clothes closet but no 
private bath. The mirror on the 
dresser reflected a wavering image. 
Impelled by some mad impulse to 
decorate the non-decoratable, the 
Emersons had placed a squatty 
white vase with a lid over it not on 
the dresser but, of all places, under 
the bed. 

M RS. EMERSON conducted 
Lyn on a tour of the 
premises, introducing her in the 
kitchen to Dilsey, the cook. Dilsey’s 
effusive politeness in greeting the 
new boarder could not offset the 
further decline in Lyn’s spirits a 
glance around the kitchen bought 
her. Cooking was done on a wood- 
burning stove. There was no re- 
frigerator and no running water.

“Where does one bathe?” Lyn 
asked Mrs. Emerson. 

“On the back porch in summer. 
In the kitchen during winter. We 
use the wash tub and draw water 
from the well, which is right handy 
here on the back porch.” 

The wash tub was handy to the 
well but fifty feet of rope was 
wound around the well’s windlass, 
indicating the water was not handy 
to the surface. Weekday mornings 
she would be working in the city, 
Lyn realized, so she could shower in 
her apartment. She would have to 
gloss over the four-day weekends 
with a pungent perfume. 

Standing on the porch, Lyn 
needed to inquire no further about 
plumbing facilities. Plainly visible 
in the backyard stook a privy— and 
it was not handy to the back porch. 
She asked what provisions were 
made for one’s toilet during dark 
nights or rainy weather. 

“There’s a chamber commode 
under your bed,” Mrs. Emerson 
said. 

Well, Lyn thought, the porcelain 
vase would not go onto the dresser, 
after all. 

Standing on the porch, looking 
east toward a heavily wooded area, 
she heard strangely familiar grunts 
and squeals which prompted her to 
ask, “Is there a pigpen out 
yonder?” 

“Yes,” Mrs. Emerson said, with 
strange pride, “and a chicken 
house. Out here we raise our own 
ham and eggs.” 



, Lyn stared dully at the wood lot. 
The accumulating lack of amenities 
had pyramided her disappoint- 
ments and now the pigsty beyond 
the outhouse topped the pyramid. 
No champac odors, those. All the 
shimmering illusions of romance 
she might weave for Amal’s 
imagination could be swept away 
by a zephyr from the east. Even so, 
with a bath so difficult to accom- 
plish she might be hoping for an 
easterly breeze as a lesser evil at the 
end of an active weekend. 

Small wonder courtship was such 
a slow process in the twentieth 
century, she thought ruefully — it 
had to await favoring winds. 

Mrs. Emerson suggested they 
return to the parlor, sit a spell and 
get acquainted. Lyn followed her 
down a creaking hallway, dropped 
to a creaking horsehair settee and 
listened to Mr. Emerson, creaking 
in his rocking chair by the window 
as he read the sports section of the 
newspaper. Mrs. Emerson opened 
the conversation by inquiring what 
had brought Lyn to Dotham. 

“I’m a psychologist, here to ad- 
minister therapy to a young man 
with problems. Hopefully I intend 
to use the diversionary method by 
entertaining him — but what does 
one do for entertainment in 
Dotham?” 

“Mr. Emerson and I have our 
work. Young people have church 
socials, ball games, moving-picture 
shows and, of course, courting. If 
you wish to entertain your fellow

here we have a gramaphone — if he 
likes music. You have parlor privi- 
leges till ten, when we blow out the 
lamps. After ten you can use the 
porch swing, but only until eleven. 
Mr. Emerson and I must get our 
rest. Of course, there’s the mill 
pond, but nice girls aren’t found at 
the mill pond after ten-thirty at 
night.” 

“How does one get to the 
movies?” 

“You catch the bus over at 
Johnny Reb’s. Vernon and I seldom 
go. Jitney fare plus the show tickets 
for two come to seventy cents.” 

Lyn had seen Johnny Reb’s on 
her way out. It was a frame 
building held together by tin ad- 
vertising signs nailed to its walls 
and it stood a half-mile away, 
where the pavement on the road 
ended. 

Her dejection must have shown 
on her face for she read clearly and 
without effort Mrs. Emerson’s 
thoughts: Poor girl, she’s so hooked 
on diversions she’ll never adjust to 
the real world. Lyn was surprised; 
obviously Mrs. Emerson con- 
sidered Dotham real and Los 
Angeles the illusion. 

ii TkiT Y PATIENT will arrive at 
XVA the station at five 
o’clock,” Lyn said, glancing at the 
clock on the fireplace mantel. “I 
suppose I should call a taxi and go 
meet him.” 

“That would be wasteful,” Mrs. 



Emerson said. “The closest 
telephone’s at the bus stop. The call 
would cost a nickel and the bus fare 
into town is only a nickel.” 

“Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!” 

Lyn’s ejaculation aroused Mr. 
Emerson. Looking up from his 
paper, he asked, “Miss Oberlin, 
where’s your patient staying?” 

“At the Culpepper farm.” 

“It’s only about half a mile from 
here. He can walk it in fifteen 
minutes if he’s not afflicted.” 

She supposed Mr. Emerson was 
right. Amal was to call for her at 
seven o’clock, though now she 
assumed it would be .closer to 
seven-thirty. All she had seen here 
might still be for the best. Once 
Amal got a taste of primitive life he 
might speed up their courtship and 
get back to civilization. 

Lyn’s gloom was lifted when 
Dilsey entered to serve bowls of 
home-made ice cream and cookies. 
Putting aside his paper, Mr. 
Emerson joined in the repast and in 
the conversation which, according 
to the rules of the Historical So- 
ciety, avoided discussion of any in- 
cident occurring after 1934. In the 
quiet social atmosphere, a mocking 
bird singing in the chinaberry tree 
outside, Lynn admitted to herself 
that the spirit of girlish adventure 
that had brought her here was un- 
professional and the setbacks were 
all to the woman, not the therapist. 

She had dismissed Amal’s false 
memory as deja vu. The song, 
Begin the Beguine, had retained a 



40 



GALAXY 




measure of popularity over the 
years and the memory of it had 
simply been dragged from Amal’s 
consciousness. His chief problem 
was his shyness, which could be 
overcome by close association with 
a sympathetic female therapist. 

“I see by the paper, Emily,” Mr. 
Emerson commented, “that Babe 
Ruth’s claiming he’ll hit sixty 
homers again this year.” 

“Who’s Babe Ruth?” 

Both smiled at the naivete of her 
question. Mr. Emerson answered, 
“Babe Ruth is the greatest baseball 
player who ever lived.” 

She was remembering Yosemite 
and the name she and Amal had fed 
lo the information computer. The 
changed syllable in “Baby Ruth,” 
insignificant to the human mind, 
would have made the input un- 
readable to the machine. To 
imagine that a boy in Iraq had ever 
heard of an American athlete 
playing a game never played in Iraq 
was as incredible as supposing that 
boy had a memory of a past 
America. Now she would have to 
reopen her mind to the validity of 
Amal’s obsession. 

As she weighed the information 
the sound of a motor car came from 
the north and Mr. Emerson, rising 
to go to the window, remarked, 
“Another pastime of ours is 
watching the cars go by.” 

Lyn arose and went to the screen 
door. She, too, was interested in an- 
cient automobiles. Beyond the 
hedge in front of the house a strip 



of plowed ground offered an 
unimpaired view of approaching 
motorists. 

She was watching as the car 
rounded the curve from behind a 
clump of trees. It was a sports 
roadster with the top down and wire 
spokes on the wheels, a beautiful 
machine by any standard of 
aesthetics. She glanced in envy at 
the driver. Despite the wool hat 
pulled low over his eyes, Lyn 
recognized Amal and flew through 
the doorway as the car vanished 
behind the hedge, braking to a stop 
before the Emerson’s mailbox. 

She was through the hedge before 
he turned off the motor. 

“Where did you get this?” 

Almost swaggering in blue jeans 
and a plaid shirt, he swung around 
the car, extending his hand in 
greeting. Since it was all he offered 
she accepted the handshake, her 
eyes still on the huge headlights, the 
outjutting bumper, the chrome and 
the polished red paint. 

“I bought it in Dotham,” he said. 
“It’s a Model-A Essex with a V-8 
engine and it will do eighty — that’s 
miles per hour — on the Dotham 
Raceway. Would you like to drive 
it?” 

“I’m dying to,” she said. “But 
you must meet the Emersons. Mr. 
Emerson just shocked me with 
some information. It’s ‘Babe,’ not 
‘Baby’ Ruth you remembered from 
this era.” 

“No,” he said, as they walked 
toward the house. “It was Baby

Ruth, a candy bar. I found one at 
the station. In my previous life it 
was my favorite candy.” 

He was not smiling as he spoke. 
They mounted the steps to where 
the Emersons waited. 

“How do you like Dotham?” was 
Mr. Emerson’s first question. 

“Greatest little town in the 
world,” Amal answered with an en- 
thusiasm dismaying to Lyn. “I 
hadn’t been here an hour before I 
met the mayor and bought an au- 
tomobile from him. How would 
y’all like to go for a ride?” 

He had intentionally used the 
plural noun correctly — his in- 
vitation was directed to Mrs. 
Emerson. 

“We’d simply love it,” she 
answered, thinking: He’s one of 
us — and so pleasantly exuberant 
after the girl. 

He was exuberant, Lyn admitted. 
Too much so, in fact. It was a facet 
of his personality she had not ob- 
served before and was probably the 
overcompensation of a shy person 
among strangers, but Lyn did not 
care for Mrs. Emerson’s invidious 
comparison. The sanctimonious, 
penny-pinching landlady was no 
whirling dervish herself. 

“Of course. I’d rather you not 
drive over twenty with mother in 
the car,” Mr. Emerson warned 
needlessly. 

“Don’t let it bother your frosty 
pow, Mr. Emerson.” Amal waved 
away the older man’s fears with a 
confident hand. “I’m a careful 



driver. I keep telling myself that the 
life I save may be my great-great- 
grandmother’s.” 

Amal’s remark skirted close to 
taboo areas, but Emerson grinned. 
“I can see you’ve visited Johnny 
Reb’s place.” 

Emerson thought: And nipped his 
bootleg moonshine. 

Lyn read the thought clearly, yet 
could not understand it. Amal, 
who, she had to admit, was much 
farther advanced in the dialect than 
she, seemed to catch connotations 
in Emerson’s remark which she 
missed. 

“Yes, sir! And I mean to tell you, 
old Johnny and me get along right 
nice.” 

Suddenly Amal’s attention 
swirled to Lyn. Placing an avun- 
cular arm over her shoulder, he 
drew her to him in an act of 
masculine bravado obviously 
adopted to camouflage his shyness. 
He had even bolstered his ego with 
an extremely pungent after-shave 
lotion. 

“Honey, we just got to take in 
The Red-Headed Woman tonight. 
The boys at the pool hall tell me the 
lovemaking in it is something fierce 
and that Jean Harlow’s really got 
‘it’ ” 

“What’s ‘it?’ ” Lyn asked. 

Amal slapped his brow in mock 
anguish. “Honey, they didn’t teach 
you a thang at doctoring school!” 

The Emersons laughed at what 
must have been an inside joke and 
Lyn asked, “You seem to have got-

ten around a lot — when did you get 
here?” 

“Early this morning. I’d heard 
tell there was hard times in Ala- 
bama so I thought I’d come early 
and get a little federal money in cir- 
culation. So I bought a car, because 
I wasn’t about to see you stuck out 
in the country with nothing to do 
but feed the pigs.” He squeezed her 
closer. “I knew that little ole girl of 
mine wouldn’t take kindly to toting 
slops.” 

His rodomontade was to calm his 
unease in the presence of strangers, 
but despite her awareness of his 
defense mechanism Lyn had never 
felt so disgustingly dependent on 
anyone before— or enjoyed the 
feeling so much. 

A MAL seemed born to this time 
l and place. During their first 
weekend he played on the Dotham 
baseball team and decided to 
extend his stay an extra week to 
enter his Essex in a stock-car race 
on the dirt track south of Dotham. 
Before their first week was half 
over he became a local legend — 
somewhere between Diamond Jim 
Brady and John L. Sullivan — when 
he fought a boy at Johnny Reb’s, 
then paid the boy’s doctor bills. 
Among his peers Amal was 
reckless, quick-tempered and quite 
popular. Alone with Lyn he was 
setting no new track records as a 
lady’s man. 

They joined the Baptist Young 
People’s Union at the urging of the 



ice-cream parlor set, which was 
also the ball-ground, dirt-track and 
juke-joint set and — in conversa- 
tions with other girls about their 
boy friends, so circumspect and 
mindful of something called “the 
purity of Southern womanhood” in 
public — Lyn learned that even by 
Dotham standards Amal was a 
slow courter. He should have kissed 
her good night after their third 
date. After their fourth he had not 
offered to shake hands. When the 
Emersons blew out the lights Amal 
told her goodbye and moved out 
fast. From his first week’s progress 
Lyn estimated that they would 
reach the mill pond by the begin- 
ning of the twenty-second century. 

Still, drawn by Amal’s en- 
thusiasms, she was growing ac- 
customed to hard beds and begin- 
ning to like the glow of kerosene 
lamps. He bought her a grama- 
phone record of someone named 
Pressley, accompanied by Bix 
Beiderbecke on the guitar, singing 
Heartbreak Hotel. It became “their 
song,” though more hers than his. 
His favorite sound was the roar of 
automobiles on the dirt track. 

Through physical labor — 
sweeping her room, helping Dilsey 
do the dishes, driving Amal’s car 
without power steering — Lyn grew 
more conscious of her body. The 
girls at the Baptist Young People’s 
Union made her aware of her 
body’s lures. They taught her how 
to throw her pelvis slightly forward 
as a “come-hither” signal when she

talked to a boy and how to give her 
date a thigh brush when she walked 
beside him, but she could not give 
Amal a thigh brush. Unlike his 
companions Amal kept his distance 
from her on the promenade from 
the picture show to the ice-cream 
parlor. When Lyn moved closer 
Amal crowded the curb — and self- 
respect prevented her from forcing 
him to walk in the gutter. 

His theory of Epicurean restraint 
was working, she could tell from 
the glitter in his eyes and his ani- 
mation of manner around her. Un- 
fortunately the theory worked two 
ways. The cat was on the tin roof 
and the sun was rising, but the cat 
with the most sensitive paws was 
the pussy. 

On the Wednesday that marked 
the beginning of their second week 
in Dotham, Amal yielded to the 
pressures of his peer group enough 
to link arms with her in their stroll 
from the Empire. As a reward for 
his valor Lyn gave him a rolling 
thigh brush. On Thursday he lin- 
gered at the Emerson’s after lights- 
out and took her out to the porch, 
but only to discuss in privacy a sub- 
ject taboo to the period. He was be- 
ginning to take readings from the 
stress gauges he had attached to 
subterranean fault lines and, 
standing beside her, he gave her an 
account of “My Day in the 
Moholes.” 

Stirred by his maleness in the 
darkness she went with him to his 
auto, parked beyond the hedge, and 



when he took her hand to shake it 
in farewell she reached up on pure 
impulse and kissed him lightly. 
Instead of following up her gesture, 
he turned to get into his car, but he 
didn’t open the door to get in. He 
vaulted over the door. 

Pondering this strange love traf- 
fic, she ambled back to the dark 
house. His nature was urging him 
to caress her, she sensed, but the 
barriers in his mind were too strong 
for his energies to crumble, his im- 
petuosity to vault. Still, this shy lad 
of the twentieth century was also an 
adroit Cal Tech student of the 
twenty-first. He should either eat or 
get off the banquet stool. 

On the next night they again 
made it to the front porch and she 
made it to the swing — to sit alone 
and listen while he read her poetry 
from a book he held in one hand 
and by a candle he held in the other. 
The first ballad Amal breathed in 
the direction of her eyebrow was 
Gunga Din. 

She was tempted to suggest he 
get a bell to go with his book and 
candle, but a lyre would have been 
more appropriate. As a displaced 
minnesinger, his courting methods 
antedated the 1930s by four 
hundred years. Turning him into a 
modern lover would require psy- 
chiatric help, not psychological 
counseling. 

I NTO her second week at the 
village, Lyn found that the 
boxy- Baroque architecture of

Dotham had grown more pleasing 
to her than the plastic uniformity of 
Los Angeles. During her three 
working days each week the city 
was becoming attractive only as a 
place where she could take a shower 
without heating her own water. 
Moreover, her constant face-to- 
face confrontations in Dotham 
were creating in her a lively interest 
in people. 

Mrs. Emerson had a passion for 
lurid confession magazines which 
she indulged in secret because of 
her husband’s disapproval. Made 
aware of her landlady’s secret, Lyn 
delighted in smuggling the quaint 
magazines into the house. Since the 
romances were concealed in her 
room, Lyn read them to inform 
herself more fully on the ethos of 
the period and found herself 
hooked on the sorrowful tales of 
girls who had sinned. But Amal’s ti- 
midity made it difficult for Lyn to 
identify with the fallen heroines in 
the stories. 

Amal kissed her on their second 
Friday. An overly long poem he 
read to her on the porch had caused 
them to exceed their sparking time. 
As they stood on the porch bidding 
each other good night Mr. 
Emerson, who allowed no grace pe- 
riod, rapped loudly on the front 
bedroom window. In response to 
the urgency of the sound Amal 
leaned down and kissed her. His 
lips touched hers with a butterfly 
flutter and were quickly withdrawn. 
Though delivered under duress — 



the kiss was indeed delivered. 

His hands were touching her acci- 
dentally more often now — and so 
far from the conventional areas of 
accidental contact that Lyn began 
to fend him off. That nebulous con- 
cept, “the purity of Southern 
womanhood’’ and the warnings 
against the pitfalls of love she found 
in the confession magazines were 
beginning to influence her thinking. 
She and Amal visited the mill pond 
together — but at high noon. 

She was reevaluating the at- 
titudes she had brought with her to 
Dotham and in retrospect they were 
horrifying. She had come thinking 
like a Jezebel. In her was dawning a 
resolution to behave like the gentle- 
woman she was and not some 
brazen hussy. 

As Amal learned to advance — 
Lyn retreated. 

On the second Sunday he 
embraced her when he kissed her 
good night and even tried to nuzzle 
her neck. She pushed him away. 

Though smiling, he half-com- 
plained, “Had we but worlds 
enough and time, your coyness, 
lady, were no crime. But this is our 
last week.’’ 

“I’m not being coy, Amal. Now 
you go home like a good boy and 
sleep off this wild outburst of 
passion. You hear?” 

Though lightly and in ironic jest, 
Lyn spoke the truth. Her repulse of 
Amal’s first genuine attempt to es- 
tablish a male-female relationship 
sprang from motives more complex

than coyness. Perhaps reinforced 
by his diffidence, his manners, his 
grace, his shifting and many-shaded 
moods all enthralled her, but the 
power and delicacy of his mind, 
which continued to defy her skills 
as a reader, awed her. Though a 
student of science, he possessed a 
felicity of phrase and gift of meta- 
phor a poet might have envied. His 
mathematical conceptualizing was 
so far beyond her that, in kindness, 
he had scratched the subject from 
their conversational agenda. 

With all this and a green card, 
too, in Amal she sensed a Pan ca- 
pable of piping her into glades she 
feared to enter lest she be lost as a 
female adjunct to a very dominant 
male who might enchant her and 
vanish forever, leaving her to 
wander the empty meadows of life 
where no birds sang. She wanted no 
part of a love affair with this mar- 
velous boy, she decided, and re- 
solved never to yield to his blan- 
dishments — if he should ever 
choose to blandish. 

After all, they weren’t truly com- 
patible, she told herself, referring to 
the one area where their knowledge 
and intellects approached parity: 
her tastes ran to love poetry, 
Amal’s to dramatic, classic, epic, 
lyric, and narrative. The one love 
poem he enjoyed reciting to her was 
The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, 
but the only version he knew was in 
Arabic. His favorite poem was 
Invictus and he managed to hurl his 
own defiance from the lines: 



I am the master of my fate, 

I am the captain of my soul. 

In those lines she saw a conflict 
developing between them. Amal 
had wanted an old-fashioned girl 
who would see that twentieth- 
century decorum was maintained. 
He had his old-fashioned girl — if he 
ever got up enough courage to 
claim her — but an old-fashioned 
girl never committed herself with a 
boy until she was master of their 
fate, his and hers. 

As her days with Amal in 
Dotham dwindled toward the end, 
Lyn, in her malaise, overlooked a 
a fact she had previously con- 
sidered — her bashful Lochinvar 
from the mid- East was also an 
adroit Cal Tech technician with a 
green card and an instinct for 
twentieth-century decorum. On 
their last scheduled Saturday in 
Dotham, Lyn watched her would- 
be lover hit a home run that won a 
ball game after he had failed to 
persuade her to stay another week 
in the village at his expense to 
watch him drive in the Dotham 100. 
There was a victory celebration at 
Johnny Reb’s and Amal drove her 
home after eleven. And gave her 
only a chaste, parting kiss. 

Lying on her hard mattress, re- 
viewing her stay in Dotham, Lyn 
sadly admitted that the home-run 
hitter could not bunt his way to first 
base on her infield. 

On Sunday, after ten-thirty at 
night, on the banks of the old mill 
pond, Amal gave her a $3,000 (old

currency) diamond ring. Suddenly 
there was a whole new ball game. 

IV 

A LTHOUGH Lyn had never 
l seriously considered marriage 
because the mentalities of most 
men were for her an open and ill- 
written book, either boring or 
pornographic, history itself miti- 
gated against the family as a social 
organization. 

In the twenty-first century the 
population of the globe had peaked 
into the paradoxically but aptly 
named “population sink.” Over- 
crowding had triggered a mass 
psychosis and murder for lebens- 
raum had piled the bodies high at 
Austerlitz and Waterloo, Vienna 
and the Vatican — particularly the 
Vatican, where St. Peter’s was 
razed. Seeds of the mass slaughter 
sprouted from families packed into 
flats where the sidewalks below 
were made unsafe by falling bodies, 
usually those of old and infirm 
family members and later the 
young and helpless. 

Murder became a family affair, 
in practice an unpunishable offense 
because of the crowded courts and 
overtaxed police and legally be- 
cause of judicial prejudice — a judge 
hearing the trial of a mother 
charged with infanticide might 
have, that morning, dispatched his 
mother-in-law. The laws against 
euthanasia were honored in the 
breach and such murders were 



treated as de facto family affairs. 
For a little more than a year 
domestic strife held nature in a 
balance of sorts but at a grave 
detriment to the traditional respect 
for motherhood and the family. 

Nature had made other tentative 
gestures toward solving the popu- 
lation crisis. By 2030 it was esti- 
mated that forty per cent of the 
population was homosexual, but 
even the gay turned vicious when 
crowded six or eight to the room 
and forced to sleep in shifts. Then, 
quite suddenly, nature achieved a 
final solution to the problem. Inter- 
family violence developed into a 
lust for violence and the domestic 
strife overflowed into the streets. 

In New York City, at 9:17 on the 
morning of May 18, 2034, a man 
from Stamford was turning the 
corner at Madison to go north on 
Fifth Avenue when he collided with 
a youth hurrying south on Fifth. 
The youth stepped back, 
apologized, then lunged at the 
commuter’s throat. The man from 
Stamford, a beginning student of 
karate, killed him instantly with a 
neck chop. 

Some pedestrians saw only the 
youth slain and turned to attack the 
older man, but he had his own par- 
tisans among those who had seen 
him assaulted first. Sides were 
taken. Brawls erupted east on 
Madison, north on Fifth, as an un- 
checked chain-reaction was trig- 
gered. Manhattan’s human pile 
blew up.

Television cameras were rushed 
to the scene. A morning program 
for shut-in children engaged in 
filming the ducks live from 
Central Park was almost im- 
mediately engulfed in televising the 
fighting. So exuberant and conta- 
gious was the violence that children 
in a Bronx nursing home watching 
the show began to throw their 
cereal bowls and spoons at each 
other. Soon the world was watching 
via telestar, but the average life of a 
television crew was only forty-five 
minutes. After three hours all 
broadcasting, radio and television, 
ceased. No telephone calls were 
taken or sent at the city’s switch- 
boards — the operators had hit the 
streets. Planes and buses entered 
the city but none came out. A long 
silence descended over New York. 
The outside world waited for news 
and grew strangely restive. 

What was happening in New 
York City? 

Later eyewitness reports filled the 
blanks. Lyn’s American history 
book held a survivor’s account 
which appalled her with its unin- 
volved detachment: 

After the first frenzy the fury 
left me. I was no longer 
fighting to express long-pent 
frustrations but for a better 
world. According to my faith, 
my soul was damned by what I 
did, but my faith — or fate — no 
longer mattered. The better 
world I fought for grew visible 



to my eyes as I wasted my op- 
ponents. 

There’s a naturalness about a 
dead body, an inoffensive 
inertness — nevertheless, we had 
to clear the arena. No one at- 
tacked taxi drivers engaged in 
removing the litter or even the 
bulldozer operators digging 
trenches in the parks. There 
were no wounded to take care 
of, for down was out, and no 
lack of food for the fighting 
crews after the second hour. 
The restaurants were all 
overstocked. 

A killing code developed 
quickly — one selected op- 

ponents of one’s own age, sex 
and weight. To do otherwise 
invited immediate extinction by 
nearby groups. We were all en- 
gaged in a civic effortmoti- 
vated by the simple slogan: 
“You are breathing my air. 
Stop it!” 

Of course, a winner might feel 
momentary triumph — we were 
fighting for high stakes — and 
the loser never knew that he 
lost. My own techniques, 
though improvised, were highly 
successful and, being religious, 
I always remembered to say a 
little prayer for my opponent. I 
would feint for her eyes with a 
pair of scissors in my right 
hand and slip a stiletto through 
her rib cage with my left hand 
when the woman lifted her 
arms to shield her eyes. You

see, I was left-handed and a 
nurse in peace time. My 
knowledge of anatomy helped. 

After it was over, I felt — 
well, peaceful and purged. 

F IVE days after the killing 
started, a camera truck rolled 
unmolested along the streets of 
Manhattan, beaming the scene to 
the waiting world. Bright-faced 
women and smiling men waved 
happily from uncrowded sidewalks. 
It was spring in Central Park and 
workmen were already returfing the 
mass graves. The city’s buildings 
were unmarred. A population of 
sixteen million had been reduced to 
four million and the city was alive 
again. 

Experts in mass behavior held 
television responsible for triggering 
the destruction on a worldwide 
scale, not a profound deduction. 
Fighting broke out in Rio de Ja- 
neiro while the peaceful scenes were 
being shown and death moved with 
the sun for four circuits of the 
globe. Few cities were disrupted by 
the destruction of real property. 
Only Los Angeles, with its tradition 
of fire and flamboyance, was 
burned to the ground and from its 
ashes rose trees and towers. 

Searing itself into human con- 
sciousness, the Holocaust changed 
old concepts of the family. It was 
recognized that parenthood re- 
quired an intelligence and capacity 
for love beyond most men and 
women. Professional mothers, 



chosen for their maternal instincts, 
affectionate natures and pelvic ca- 
pacities, provided wombs for the 
fertilized ova of women unwilling to 
bear children and provided care and 
training for the proxy children until 
school age. 

Marriage was usually based on 
mutual interests such as that of the 
Emersons in literary research. 
Romantic love was generally 
regarded as too evanescent to form 
the basis of a marriage, although 
psychologists had case histories of 
“love” marriages which had been 
the source of abiding contentment. 
In her knowledge of such case his- 
tories, Lyn could not accept her 
own arguments about her incom- 
patibility with Amal. So when 
Amal, on Sunday night, came to a 
dinner at the Emerson’s which 
Dilsey sadly referred to as “the last 
supper,” Lyn hoped his preoccu- 
pation and moodiness reflected 
grief over her departure or, at least, 
remorse over his failure as a lover. 

Shortly after nine the old folks 
excused themselves. Amal had less 
than an hour’s courting time in the 
parlor plus an hour on the porch. 
Lyn knew his situation was 
hopeless. He would never be able to 
sweep her off her feet in less than 
two hours, even if he could summon 
and focus on her that fiery im- 
petuosity which endeared him to 
others. 

Obviously he was in no mood for 
impetuosity. For long minutes they 
sat in morose silence, holding hands

as if huddling against the chill of 
their farewell. Finally he said, half 
in apology and half reproachfully, 
“Maybe I needed more guidance 
from you, Lyn?” 

“Columbus had no navigator,” 
she reminded him. “When you’re 
the captain, you con the ship.” 
“Your mind was my Sargasso 
Sea,” he said. 

If she remembered correctly, the 
Sargasso Sea was an area where 
ancient sailing ships were entangled 
in seaweed, and she bridled at the 
comparison. “I didn’t foul your an- 
chor — Captain. All you needed was 
a little gumption.” 

“Or a more cooperative crew.” 
“You asked for an old-fashioned 
girl. You got one.” 

“Complete with inhibitions,” he 
agreed. 

“Are you accusing me of ti- 
midity?” 

“Aren’t you timid?” 

“Of course not.” 

“Then I’m calling your bluff,” he 
said. “A full moon has risen and the 
mill pond, they tell me, is beautiful 
by moonlight. Are you game to go 
a-roving so late at night?” 

“Put out the lamp, boy!” 

Even in simple procedures he 
rarely used conventional methods. 
As she waited at the door he went 
to the lamp, but he didn’t stoop to 
blow the flame from the wick. 
Standing, he held a magazine over 
the chimney until the lamp 
flickered out and then came to her 
in the doorway. 



T HEY walked into the moon- 
light, across the yard, through 
the hedge, and crossed the road to 
follow the path through the woods. 
Walking beside her, he guided her 
with a light touch on the arm. Leaf- 
Filtered moonlight flecked the 
ground under the trees. 

When he spoke his voice sounded 
introspective. “Lyn, do you think 
there can be an affinity between a 
man and woman deeper than sexual 
attraction?” 

“Of course. Romantic love is 
clinically recognized.” 

“I’ve always been dubious of the 
word ‘love,’ ” he said. 

“It has been too often profaned 
for me to profane it.” 

His sentence sounded familiar. 
“I’ve read The Lives of the 
Saints she snapped, hoping he 
had quoted Saint Francis. 

“The word ‘love’ is like a coin,” 
he continued. “It can be new- 
minted of gold or skilfully counter- 
feited. I’ve bit my own coin, rung it, 
given it the acid test, but coming 
from a sex-segregated society, 
lacking the chance for commingling 
that you’ve had, I feel — ” 

“Whoa, there!” She spun him in 
his tracks to face her. “Don’t ac- 
cuse me of harlotry. I’ll have you 
know that technically I’m a 
virgin — in Dotham or out.” 

“I didn’t mean — ” he started to 
say. Then, dazedly: “As beautiful 
as you are? As physically sound?” 
“And as fast on my feet. I told 
you I was a mind-reader. When 



50

clammy thoughts start clutching, 
the lily of romance comes ungilded 
fast. Now, you were saying?” 

She turned him back down the 
path, hoping her vehemence had 
diverted his mind from her use of 
the word “technically.” 

He took her hand and said, “I 
was just trying to tell you that I love 
you.” 

She couldn’t answer him or 
squeeze his hand to show she ap- 
proved or reciprocated his affec- 
tions, but he had not asked a 
question. He had merely made a 
statement with all the ardor of a 
bookkeeper announcing. Miss 
Oberlin, your books are balanced. 

She had not imagined it would be 
like this at all, the two of them 
walking side by side through the 
woods. But how had she imagined 
it? His words cresting on some 
wave of passion in a pillowed room 
with soft lights, wine and back- 
ground music? But why had her 
mouth grown suddenly dry and why 
this urge to weep? 

They walked on in silence. He 
had said all he could say and she 
had to wait for her mouth to 
resume salivation and free her 
tongue. 

Finally she said, “I hadn’t 
thought anything could be so com- 
monplace, so ordinary, so beau- 
tiful—” 

Her voice trailed into silence as 
they broke from the woods onto the 
banks of the pond. The moon had 
cleared the trees on the opposite 



shore and glittered now on the 
water. He guided her toward the 
dam and mill house. She thought, 
My heart is like a singing bird that 
nestles on a halcyon shoot. 

“Amal, what’s a halcyon shoot?” 
“An unwavering bough.” 

A FEW yards north of the mill 
- house rose a grassy hum- 
mock. Amal led her there, spread 
his coat on the dew-wet grass and 
they sat down. He sprawled beside 
her, lounging back on one elbow, 
his face turned to her. 

“You know too little about me,” 
he said. “I shouldn’t speak, but I 
can’t let you go away thinking 
you’ve failed. Besides, I don’t want 
you to leave me.” 

He paused for a moment, groping 
for words. 

“There’s only one first love for a 
man, just as there’s only one Ver- 
sailles with its Hall of Mirrors. A 
man can enter Versailles for the 
first time only once. Later he may 
covet castles in Spain or live in 
castles on the Rhine, but they’re all 
measured by his memories of Ver- 
sailles. You’re my Hall of Mir- 
rors.” 

Again he fell silent and again she 
felt an inexplicable urge to weep. 
Sensing her turmoil, he waited, not 
touching her. 

Finally he asked, “How do you 
feel about it?” 

“Like a parachutist taking her 
first jump. But I was foretold this 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE

on the night I first met you. Oh, 
hush up, Amal! I’m trying to keep 
from crying.” 

He said nothing. 

She managed to hold back her 
tears, but she could not look at him 
as she said, “I love you, too, 
Amal.” 

Her own words sounded even 
more prosaic to her than his had. 

Amal began to thrash around 
beside her in a manner that drew 
her startled gaze. He was patting 
his thighs and feeling behind him as 
if practicing on himself before 
starting on her. 

His unorthodox way of doing 
things became even more bizarre 
when he said, ‘‘I may have to ask 
you to stand up.” 

Then he sighed relief, “No, here 
it is. In my shirt pocket. Close your 
eyes and put out your hand. No, 
your left hand.” 

She complied and felt him slide a 
ring over her third finger. From the 
confession magazines she knew well 
the significance of an old-fashioned 
engagement ring — this symbol of 
love had been discontinued because 
it was emblematic of a slave 
bracelet. 

“Open your eyes,” he com- 
manded and she obeyed. 

One glance at the diamond on her 
finger assured Lyn she was truly an 
old-fashioned girl. The stone drew 
in the moonlight, congealed it and 
exploded it upward in a brilliance 
excelling its source. Her feelings, 
too, congealed around the stone 



and exploded through her in quanta 
of joy that shivered her kidneys. In 
a sudden struggle to keep from wet- 
ting herself she lost control of her 
tear ducts and finally began to cry. 

He put a comforting arm around 
her shoulder, saying, “Darling, it’s 
just a little engagement ring, not 
the Los Angeles Civic Center.” 
“Little ring!” She wept harder. 
“I wouldn’t think of swapping it for 
those monstrous towers.” 

“I wanted to ask you to marry 
me, old style, before I gave it to 
you, but I couldn’t bear to hear you 
say ‘No.’ Now you won’t have to 
answer. If it’s ‘No,’ just slip. off the 
ring and hand it back.” 

“What a dirty trick! You know 
the only way you’ll get this back is 
by cutting my finger off.” 

“Then your answer’s ‘Yes?’ ” 

“I haven’t heard the question yet, 
but the answer is: ‘Yes, you bet!’ ” 
For the first time in love and 
tenderness he kissed her then, but 
his face interfered with her view of 
the ring until she put her arm 
around his neck and held him 
closer, turning the diamond slowly 
to catch the different angles in the 
moonlight. Eventually he broke 
their embrace but held her close as 
she held the diamond out for him to 
admire. 

“It’s the most beautiful ring I’ve 
ever seen,” she said. 

Almost moodily he answered, 
“Yes, it’s beautiful, but I may be 
luring you with honest trifles to 
betray you in deeper consequence.”

“Oh, no, Amal. This bride is 
wearing white.” 

H E LAUGHED. “I didn’t mean 
it that way. One of the things 
that I haven’t told you is that I’m a 
stateless person. My parents were 
killed before I was registered at the 
creche, so I could be marrying you 
to acquire citizenship.” 

“Good. It eliminates the possi- 
bility of my becoming the first wife 
in an Arab’s harem.” 

“I want us to be married here by 
Brother Barnes,” he said. “I belong 
here. This means we’ll have to have 
a long engagement. I’m running in 
the Dotham One Hundred next 
Saturday, so we can’t be married 
for two weeks. You’ll have to stay 
over at my expense.” 

“As your fiancee, old style, I’ve a 
proprietary interest in your green 
card.” 

“I didn’t want you to think it was 
a sly trick to hire me a cheering 
section in the stands when I race.” 
“I’ll be there, waving a white 
scarf.” 

“After we’re married we can 
spend our honeymoon in the 
Dotham Inn, then fly to London or 
Paris if you wish.” 

“If you’re so stateless, who’s fi- 
nancing your green card? Some oil 
sheik?” ' 

“The United Nations through 
your State Department. My work’s 
considered valuable and I don’t 
intend to shirk it. Two months from 
now you may be attaching stress 



gauges along the Japanese Fault.” 
“Is that the ‘deeper conse- 
quence’ — a mohole?” 

“No. The question mark is me. 
You may be marrying a 
schizophrenic. My shadow mem- 
ories have grown stronger here. 
When I’m driving on the track 
someone else is steering.” 

“Have you remembered any 
details as accurately as the candy 
bar?” 

“Who knows?” He shrugged 
uneasily. “Am I wrong — or were 
the builders of this village wrong 
when a detail strikes me as false? 
There was no Model-A Essex, I’m 
sure. It’s weird but I remember an 
Essex Terrapin — and who would 
name a highspeed car a Terrapin? I 
think the V-eight was a Ford, but I 
drove a Ford Turbine.” 

“ You drove?” 

Grinning sheepishly, he tapped 
his brow. “My doppel-ganger 
drove.” 

His words drove the diamond 
from Lyn’s mind. These memories 
could be checked in the archives. 

“Do you remember him so 
vividly that you know what he 
drove?” 

“Not vividly. I’m not even sure of 
his name. One of those double 
names, I think. Lee Roy Hatcher. 
One name I do recall precisely is 
John C. Calhoun.” 

“Does it have any connotations, 
pleasant or unpleasant?” 

“It has connotations, all un- 
pleasant.” He fell silent for a

moment, deliberating, then said, 
“John C. Calhoun killed me.” 
Shivering, she looked down at her 
diamond. It seemed suddenly 
clouded. “Not you. Him. Let’s not 
talk of these things on this night.” 
“Indeed we shouldn’t — on this 
night,” he agreed, laying his head in 
her lap and" stretching out on the 
grass. “On such a night as this did 
Dido with a willow in her hand 
stand on the shore and waft her love 
to come again to Carthage.” 
Spontaneously she bent and 
kissed him. He did not have to read 
love poetry — he could compose his 
own. 

He caught the nape of her neck 
and drew her closer, nibbling her 
earlobe. Astonished at the strength 
of her delight, she drew back. She 
had no intentions, right away, of 
sinning, suffering and repenting. 

“Unlax,” she said. “We have a 
million things to talk about. We’ll 
have a formal wedding. Dilsey’s 
sister is a seamstress. She can sew 
my gown. But we must go. Nice 
girls aren’t found by the mill pond 
after ten-thirty.” 

He glanced to her watch and even 
his knuckles thrilled her as he lifted 
the locket. “You’ve been a fallen 
woman for twenty minutes. Since 
I’ve loved you a hundred years, ten 
more minutes won’t hurt.” 

ACCORDING to calculations 
xx Lyn made on Tuesday, Amal 
could not have loved her in his 
memory for a hundred years — the 



maximum time, if her conjectures 
were correct, was seventy-five 
years. 

Her co-workers were extravagant 
in their praise of her ring on 
Monday morning in the office. 
Though Dr. Kley was profuse with 
his compliments over her en- 
gagement she read disappointment 
behind his politician’s charm. Her 
announcement probably meant she 
would be giving him notice. He 
would never find another secretary 
with Lyn’s charm or her gift for 
spotting his problems and coming 
up with suggestions which so often 
substantiated his own thinking. Lyn 
agreed with Kley’s unspoken 
thoughts, but was unconcerned. 
Her biggest job was to screen his in- 
coming calls. Any woman with a 
pleasant appearance and tact could 
perform her tasks. 

She skipped lunch and her one 
o’clock class to research John C. 
Calhoun in the Doheny Library and 
found the stacks held 326 volumes 
and monographs devoted exclu- 
sively to John C. Calhoun. The 
index files listed 16,370 cross 
references to the famous South 
Carolina statesman. She settled on 
A Boy’s Life of John C. Calhoun 
and quickly discovered he had died 
fifty years before the automobile 
had been invented. 

Nonetheless, his prominence lent 
credence to Amal’s fugue memory. 
Hundreds of Southern boys in the 
twentieth century had probably 
been named for John C. Calhoun.

GALAXY 




Given the nature of those times — 
and Amal’s nature — Amal’s alter 
ego could have been killed in a fist 
or knife fight with a John C. 
Calhoun. 

Her next day’s research into the 
history of motor cars opened a new 
channel to the historical Calhoun. 

The librarian at Doheny referred 
Lyn to the Huntington Archives 
for a detailed history of autos. On 
the inter-library telephone she 
hooked into, and onto, a balding 
young librarian in the Old Car Ar- 
chives who was a stock-car racing 
buff and rattled off such names as 
Willie Jefferson, Junior Johnson 
and Daniel Gurney with more ease 
and enthusiasm than she sum- 
moned for Laing, Freud and Frau- 
milch. She could read his self- 
cursing over the telephone when his 
memory slipped and he had to refer 
to his desk computer. 

Amal was precisely right, she 
found, in “remembering” there had 
been no Model- A Essex in the 
1930s and that the V-8 engine had 
been most notably represented by a 
Ford car. The Essex had as its 
premier model the Essex Terra- 
plane, not Terrapin. The last fact 
almost authenticated Amal’s 
“memory” for her. No Arabian 
seismologists would have an image 
so close to an ancient reality adrift 
in his subconscious. 

Almost fearfully she asked if the 
files referred to a Lee Roy Hatcher 
who had driven a Ford Turbine in 
the 1930s. 



“Never,” the librarian shook her 
head. “Turbine stock cars weren’t 
raced until the mid-eighties. Very 
few were raced at Indy — In- 
dianapolis — before the 1970s. But I 
can check on Lee Roy Hatcher. 
One minute.” 

He fed the name into the com- 
puter, checked the readoff, and 
looked up. “No one by that name 
raced in the twentieth century.” 



S HE sighed her relief, but the li- 
brarian had been so helpful she 
hated to leave him with a sigh. De- 
liberately prolonging the interview, 
she asked, “Do you have a driver 
under the name of John C. 
Calhoun?” 

“Let me check,” he said, pushing 
input buttons. “I remember a John 
C. Calhoun Raceway outside 
Columbia, South Carolina, open in 
the middle eighties. It was closed 
after four meets because it killed 
too many drivers. No, there was 
no driver named John C. Calhoun.” 
Forcing a smile, she asked, “Is it 
possible to find out who was killed 
on the Calhoun Raceway?” 

He puckered his brow. 

“Usually a notation was made on 
the track program. For that I’ll 
have to check the stacks. Excuse 
me. 

In the librarian’s absence Lyn 
forced herself to think calmly. The 
Cole Porter song which had led 
them to the 1930s might have been 
popular into the twenty-first 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE 



55 




century. This whole affair was 
based on nothing but sheer con- 
jecture anyway. In his association 
with other drivers in Dotham, 
AmaT might have picked up a 
reference to the Essex Terraplane 
unconsciously. 

“By golly, I missed it.” The li- 
brarian walked on-screen, shuffling 
three papers. “Only three races 
were held at Calhoun.” Sitting 
down, he continued: “But four 
drivers died in those three years: 
James Snead in nineteen eighty-six, 
Leroy Thatcher in nineteen eighty- 
seven, Harry Joe Upton and Crazy 
Carl Williams — there’s a name for 
you — in nineteen eighty-eight.” 

Hardly hearing his bemused chat- 
ter, Lyn was thinking: Terrapin, 
Terraplane — Lee Roy Hatcher, 
Leroy Thatcher . 

“Is there any biographical data 
on Leroy Thatcher?” 

“Only in connection with the 
race. He spun out on the third turn, 
thirty-first lap, of the Columbia 
Five Hundred on June seventh, 
nineteen eighty-seven. His car was 
a Ford Turbine.” 

“Where may I get further in- 
formation?” 

The librarian lost interest visibly. 
His smile became official. “I sug- 
gest, Miss Oberlin, you try the 
Columbia Public Library news- 
paper files for June eight, nineteen 
eighty-seven.” 

The call and the telefax service 
put her credit card close to the red 
area — even for the short annals of 



Leroy Thatcher taken from the 
pages of the Columbia Observer. 
The driver’s neck had been broken 
in the crash and he had succumbed 
instantly. Dead at twenty-one, 
interred in the Columbia Cryogenic 
Mortuary by a grieving mother, his 
only survivor, Leroy Thatcher had 
followed his father to an early 
grave, the paper noted. His father, 
Earl Thatcher, had been killed in a 
crossing accident while hurrying to 
the hospital to see his new-born 
son. Earl Thatcher had also been 
twenty-one years of age. 

She walked from the library with 
the stiff-legged gait of a soldier who 
fears to advance and fears even 
more the shame of deserting his 
comrades. She had no comrades, 
no arms, no armor, but the risen 
hackles on her wrists told her she 
had found “them.” “They” existed, 
though invisible, unknown. 

Was the cryogenics burial a clue? 
She wondered. No. Medical science 
could not cure a cold — had it been 
capable of resurrecting a Lazarus 
the A.M.A.’s publicity staff would 
have swamped the media with an- 
nouncements. Yet what other 
explanation could there be? Why, 
otherwise, had Amal been denied a 
driver’s license? 

Looking down at her diamond, 
she found the hard brilliance 
reassured her of Amal’s present 
reality. She could not tell him what 
she had discovered. If he thought 
himself possessed by the spirit of 
Leroy Thatcher he would drive in 



56

the Dotham One Hundred on 
Saturday simply to prove himself 
master of his fate. If he knew, he 
would transfer to the 1980s village 
and attempt to reweave the broken 
strands of his destiny by rounding 
the third turn of the thirty-first lap 
in a Ford Turbine. As long as he did 
not know, she could guide him from 
the obvious dangers, protect him, 
learn from him, through him. 

Amal had kept the appointment 
with “them” that she had failed to 
keep. Sooner or later those who had 
granted him the green card would 
step out of the shadows and de- 
mand that he settle accounts. It was 
a law of politics. 

R IDING to Dotham on the 
- subway, Lyn was increasingly 
grateful for those special talents 
that had trained her to conceal her 
emotions from persons whose 
minds were open to her. Still, Amal 
presented problems she doubted she 
could handle. Already she was 
feeling furtive. At the beginning of 
a life’s relationship with a man she 
wanted to be honest with above all 
others she was burdened with 
secrets she must try to keep from 
him. Would he sense her inner hor- 
ror when he caught her wondering 
if she, in truth, loved a dead man? 

When the clank of couplings 
reminded her the station was ap- 
proaching, she resolved to put all 
such wild conjecture behind her in 
his presence. Then, with a sudden 
panic, she realized her resolution 



was petrifyingly illogical— one 
could not remind oneself not to 
think of purple cows without 
thinking of purple cows. 

Usually Amal was waiting at the 
station to drive her home since he 
rode a shorter distance from 
Pasadena. Taking a deep breath she 
entered the waiting room and saw 
him. He was already dressed for 
Dotham and seated on a bench. She 
fixed her face into a smile of 
eagerness as she neared him, but he 
did not look up. Scribbling on a 
writing tablet with a ballpoint pen 
of the period, he had not noticed 
her entrance and paid no attention 
to her presence. 

She glanced down. He was 
writing Arabic symbols across the 
page, jotting down a phrase, 
pausing, jotting down another. 
Deep in concentration he was vio- 
lating a taboo, almost. It was 
extremely unlikely that a twentieth 
century Dothamite would be 
writing in Arabic. Waiting longer, 
she grew vexed. His beloved, 
wearing his ring and wafting his fa- 
vorite perfume downwind toward 
him, was standing within three feet 
of him, completely ignored. 

He must be writing a love lyric in 
his native tongue to translate to her 
later, she decided, her vexation 
vanishing. Suddenly she felt an 
urge to reach out and feel the 
nape of his neck to check it for 
scar tissue — or bone calcification. 
Leroy Thatcher’s neck had been 
broken.

She whirled and silently fled to 
the dressing room. 

When she approached him the 
second time, high-heeled shoes clat- 
tering, he rose and greeted her with 
only a smile. “You must have come 
in while I wasn’t looking.” 

He did not offer her a kiss and 
she did not insist, saying, “You 
were writing something in Arabic 
and I decided not to disturb you.” 

“It isn’t Arabic,” he said, 
steering her toward the door, “al- 
though some of the symbols are. I 
was figuring the inertial force of 
torque on a curving body.” 

“What’s the value of such 
figures?” 

“Oh, they can be used for 
anything,” he shrugged. “Knowing 
the speed, weight, center of gravity, 
and a few other factors, you could 
figure the speed at which a car 
would turn a curve without toppling 
over.” 

“You’re not worried about the 
race next Saturday?” she asked in 
sudden alarm. 

“Less worried than you, darling. 
My only worry is that I might not 
win.” 

He seemed pleased by her 
concern as they walked out of the 
station toward the parking lot and 
it occurred to her that alarm was 
natural in the sweetheart of a boy 
who was racing an automobile. 

“I am worried, Amal. You’ll be 
driving with no roll bars on the 
roadster, no safety belts, no crash 
helmet, no air pillows, nothing.” 



“That’s the way I like it, with 
nothing but skill and nerve. If I 
freeze up I’m a dead man.” 

She shuddered and momentarily 
turned her face aside. 

“What’s wrong, honey?” he 
asked. 

“Someone’s walking on my 
grave,” she said. Chill bumps were 
visible on her forearms. 

“How morbid,” he said. “Maybe 
you’d feel safer if you drove. I have 
some more figuring to do.” 

“I’d love to drive,” she said 
truthfully. 

He was preoccupied and she 
wanted to be occupied. His preoc- 
cupation would make him less at- 
tentive and her busyness would 
make her less likely to reveal varia- 
tions from her standard behavior — 
and another variation occurred al- 
most immediately. As she drove 
around the circle and passed before 
the Empire Theater, she read a 
playbill plastered on the front of the 
building: 

COMING SOON 
I MARRIED A ZOMBIE 

The juxtaposition of the playbill 
with her secret thoughts brought an 
involuntary gasp from her. 

Amal heard and glanced over. 
“Forget something?” 

“I forgot to call the baker about 
the wedding cake.” 

“I’ve put in the order,” he said. 
“He’s baking a seven-layer cake 
with a bride and groom on top.”

“Seven!” Leroy Thatcher had 
died on June 7, 1987. “Why seven?” 
“Traditional, I guess,” he 
answered without looking up from 
his jottings. “Seven’s, a lucky 
number.” 

S HE was spooked, she Jhought. 

They had been together less 
than ten minutes. A normally ap- 
perceptive Amal would have spot- 
ted her jumpiness at least three 
times and would have started to 
question her. That he had not spot- 
ted it was all to the good. But his 
inattentiveness was not normal. 
There was a vagueness about him, a 
remoteness she didn’t like. 

“Why do you have to figure 
forces to get a car around a curve?” 
she asked. “Wouldn’t it be easier to 
slow down a little?” 

“I didn’t say I was plotting the 
turn of an automobile. I said the 
figures could be used for that 
purpose.” 

“What are you using them for?” 
“Nothing important, I hope.” 
“They must be important if they 
make you forget to kiss me at the 
station — so tell me about them.” 
“They’re taboo for this period. 
I’ll kiss you twice at the mailbox. 
Besides, you wouldn’t be inter- 
ested.” 

“How do you know I wouldn’t be 
interested if you don’t tell me what 
they mean?” 

“I hope you never know.” 

“Are you keeping secrets from 
me, you renegade Moslem?” 



“Backsliding Coptic Southern 
Baptist Christian,” he corrected 
her. “If a man doesn’t have a few 
secrets, he loses his attraction. I 
quote a well-known mindreader.” 
“Well, I still have a few secrets 
myself,” she said. 

“Yes — and you’ve promised to 
keep them for two weeks.” 

“You’re not only furtive,” she 
snapped. “You’re dirty-minded.” 
“Some mind. Some dirt. 
Speaking of promises, I know I 
promised you I’d always report to 
Dotham promptly after school. 
You’ll be fitting your gown tomor- 
row. I’d like to stay over at Cal 
Tech for an hour to program a 
taboo machine which will not be 
available till five.” 

“You know I look forward all 
day to meeting you at the station.” 
“And I,” he said, “look forward 
to meeting you. But I’ll make it up 
to you if we miss this once. We’ll go 
picnicking on the sacred knoll by 
the holy mill pond on Thursday — 
and I promise to be devoted, at- 
tentive and very entertaining.” 
“Entertaining how?” 

“Well, I haven’t given much 
thought to the entertainment,” he 
said. “Maybe we could go skinny- 
dipping.” 

“Skinny-dipping in daylight? 
Never!” 

“We’ll be going to prayer 
meeting Thursday night,” he said. 
“How about Friday night?” 

“Friday night for what?” 
“Skinny-dipping,” he answered.

“You said not in daylight, which 
means you must be willing at 
night.” 

“Just the two of us?” 

“Unless you want to invite 
Brother Barnes,” he said, “as a 
chaperone.” 

She thought for a moment. The 
moon would rise early on Friday. 
The idea of swimming nude in the 
moonlight with him sounded 
exciting — in the ambience of this 
time and place even daring — and 
she had visions of his muscles rip- 
pling through the water. She was 
stirred to an immediate twenty-first 
century affirmative, but she had 
learned wiles in Dotham. 

“If I agree, will you tell me your 
secret?” 

“I may not have a secret. It all 
depends on these figures.” He tap- 
ped the writing tablet and added 
cryptically: “If I have one I’ll tell 
you and we can start praying,” 

He turned back to his figures, not 
waiting for her agreement but 
assuming he had it. She had never 
seen him concentrating so 
intensely. When he dropped her by 
the mailbox, she had to remind him 
to kiss her goodbye. 

D URING the fitting of her 
gown by Dilsey’s sister, Lyn 
thought of Amal constantly. That 
night she dreamed he stood beside 
her before the altar, dressed for- 
mally for their marriage, and when 
she turned to accept the wedding 
band she found him hoary with 



cold, rime whitening his hair and 
liquid oxygen evaporating from his 
eye sockets. 

Awakened by the nightmare, she 
realized that against all logic she 
was developing an obsession about 
Amal and cryogenic burials. Her 
own sanity was splitting on the 
shoals of the single question — how 
could Amal, born to the language 
of Arabia and growing up in 
Baghdad, have valid memories of 
Leroy Thatcher, an American dead 
almost a century before? 

In the morning Amal was still 
preoccupied during the drive to the 
station. She rode beside him in 
silence, concealing her concern for 
him though inwardly her purple 
cows were threatening a stampede. 
If Amal discovered her growing 
obsession he would abandon her as 
totally insane and be off without 
hindrance to the 1980s to challenge 
his fate. 

At the office her absent- 
mindedness became apparent to 
Dr. Kley, and his awareness of her 
state of mind made her decide on a 
radical course of action. She had to 
find some answers. Kley had what 
he called an “important conference 
at the Civic Center.” Lyn knew he 
was going to the Civic Center but 
not to the City Hall. A widow in a 
plush Bunker Hill Leisure World 
pod was awaiting him with mar- 
tinis. Timing her request a few 
seconds before he left, Lyn asked 
his permission to make a personal 
long-distance phone call, confessing 



60 



GALAXY 




frankly that her credit card was ap- 
proaching a deficit. 

“Sure, Lyn, call London if you 
wish — on the city.” 

Kley was generous with his bu- 
reaucratic privileges, because he 
trusted her to justify his personal 
expenses with the Budget De- 
partment. Besides, he hoped to 
ensnare her in a net of favors, 
sooner or later, whether she was 
married or single, and carry her to 
the Leisure World tower. With the 
tolerance of a woman who has 
shared in the secrets of many men, 
Lyn respected his abilities, his in- 
nate kindness, and was amused by 
his futile hope. Though he was 
thirty years her senior, Lyn never 
thought of Dr. Kley as a dirty old 
man, merely a sexy senior citizen. 

Alone in her office, Lyn called 
the information computer in 
Columbia, South Carolina, and 
asked for the Columbia Cryogenic 
Mortuary. The computer informed 
her there was no one by that name 
in Columbia. Without hanging up, 
Lyn directed the computer to 
transfer her call to the Columbia 
Archivist and a woman answered 
the phone. Introducing herself as 
the office of the Chairman of the 
Board of Supervisors, City of Los 
Angeles, Lyn inquired about the 
Columbia Cryogenic Mortuary. 

Thinking she spoke as one of- 
ficial to another, the archivist was 
informal and informative. 

“Oh, dear. That operation went 
out of business over fifty years ago. 



The officer in charge of the per- 
petual care fund absconded and 
there was a malfunction in the mor- 
tuary’s refrigeration unit. Later the 
building was razed by a mob during 
the Holocaust because of its sym- 
bolic nature.” 

“What disposition was made of 
the bodies?” 

“Eventually they were cremated. 
A few that remained in the still- 
functioning vaults were disposed of 
to various facilities.” 

“Do you have the record on the 
body of Leroy Thatcher?” 

“Indeed. We’re very careful 
about such matters in Columbia. 
One moment. Ah, here it is. Leroy 
Thatcher’s body was transferred to 
the medical department at Duke 
University on October third, two 
thousand twenty-nine. It was 
cremated six days later in the 
presence of witnesses and the Cer- 
tificate of Cremation mailed to us 
on October eleventh. 

Lyn relaxed. Though the mystery 
of Amal’s memory remained, a 
horror was lifted from her mind. As 
his wife, she could steer him away 
from the 1980s village. She would 
not go swimming in the moonlight 
with a resurrected corpse. The only 
ice at their wedding would be in the 
mint juleps. 

V 

<< TH ROVE your powers, sibyl,” 
AAmal challenged her. 
“Prophesy something.”

Walking beside him down the 
path on the way to the picnic, Lyn 
exulted. She had been aching for a 
chance to set the skeptic on a three- 
legged stool. Last night Mr. 
Emerson’s thoughts, as he 
pretended to read a magazine, had 
given her today’s opportunity. 

“I predict that the Emersons will 
defect to the nineteen-thirties and 
buy a hamburger stand in Dotham 
as soon as their study grant 
expires.” 

“Maybe,” he agreed, knowing 
she spoke the truth. “But their 
grants don’t expire for a month. We 
may be in Ankara by then.” 

“Then call them long-distance,” 
she snapped, vexed because he had 
not turned to her in open-mouthed 
admiration. 

“Oh, I’ll take your word for it,” 
he said. 

Amal was an incorrigible confi- 
dence keeper, but she had read 
enough of Mr. Emerson’s thoughts 
to know that the old mill could 
make Amal admit to her powers. 
No one had breathed a word to 
Lyn, but she knew the Arabian 
millionaire had advanced, interest 
free, the $220.00 Emerson needed 
to complete the full payment for 
Hamburger Heaven, a hamburger 
stand facing Lee’s Square in 
downtown Dotham. 

They broke from the woods onto 
the margin of the lake. 
Downstream, within a keen ear’s 
hearing distance of the hillock 
where they planned to picnic, an old 



black man sat on the bank fishing. 
“Oh, dear! We have company.” 
“That’s Uncle Moses, the 
handyman at the Culpepper place,” 
Amal said. His voice dropped to a 
whisper. “Try to read his mind. 
He’s lived here for seventy years.” 
The old man waved to Amal’s 
shouted greeting. When they neared 
him Lyn could see the reason for 
Amal’s challenge. The left eye of 
Uncle Moses was partly covered 
with a cataract. Either the medical 
science of the period was unable to 
cope with cataracts or the old man 
could not afford the operation. 

“Uncle Moses, this is Lyn 
Oberlin, my fiancee.” 

The old man started to rise and 
Lyn said, “Keep your seat. Uncle 
Moses, we’re just passing by.” 

His cataract interfered with his 
thought messages, but she could 
grasp bits and pieces: Amal’s girl 
seems at ease. strongly at- 
tracted. .don’t blame him. .like 
to whomp it myself. 

She turned to Amal and said, 
“Come, Amal. Our shadows are 
scaring the fish.” 

“Never mind, missy. Don’t want 
’em biting just yet. Ain’t got my 
morning rest out.” 

As they climbed the rise, Amal 
said, “Well?” 

“He was thinking about 
Saturday night.” 

“That doesn’t take a mindreader. 
All they ever think about here is 
Saturday night.” Amal glanced 
down at the old man. “He belongs

with the shaved-heads. Fort Tejon 
would be his true country.” 

“You mean the skinheads,” Lyn 
corrected him. “Let’s not open the 
basket, yet. I’d like to explore the 
old mill.” 

The abandoned mill’s flooring 
was warped, its drive belt laden 
with dust, its grindstone covered 
with cobwebs. The place was dark 
and musty inside. After her eyes 
grew accustomed to the gloom, Lyn 
spotted the door she sought in the 
rear of the building. 

“Let’s look in the storage shed,” 
she suggested. 

As Emerson’s thoughts had 
foretold her, inside the storeroom 
the floor was smooth. The room 
sealed with knotty pine and a 
double bunk had been built in the 
corner. The floating corner of the 
upper tier of the bunk was sup- 
ported by the missing rail from the 
Emersons’ front porch. 

“This might be Uncle Moses’ 
hideaway,” Amal commented. 

“It may be where the Emersons 
plan to stay until the hot dog stand 
is supporting them.” 

“Very clever,” Amal said. 
“You’ve deduced that from the 
bannister rail. But how will they get 
to town and back?” 

“Probably in a Model-A Essex,” 
Lyn said, “left to them by the same 
philanthropist who advanced them 
two hundred twenty dollars on a 
two-year loan with no interest. 
Now, will you grant that I read 
minds?” 



“Why not?” He shrugged. “I’ve 
led two lives. Why not admit the 
woman I love into the brotherhood 
of freaks?” 

A bitterness in his voice alarmed 
her. They emerged into the sunlight 
and she noted that Uncle Moses 
had moved farther upstream and 
well out of earshot. 

“Darling, my talent is only an 
ability to interpret facial and body 
movements. Stage magicians have 
pulled the same tricks.” 

“So you tell yourself,” he snap- 
ped, “to keep from admitting the 
inadmissable. Let’s face it, my love. 
We’re both monsters seeking the 
Frankenstein who created us.” 

As he bent to the picnic hamper 
she could tell from his outjutting 
jaw and a vein swelling above his 
temple that the boy who had smiled 
at her the moment before was torn 
by a fury. She felt an energy 
swirling around him, encompassing 
them both, and bent to kiss the 
nape of his neck. The strange force 
died. 

“Do you like Spam, ma’am?” he 
asked. 

So their picnic in the sunlight was 
shadowed. The darkness was shot 
through with clarity when they went 
skinny-dipping in the moonlight on 
Friday. 

W 'HEN lovely women stoop to 
folly, some find sooner than 
others that men betray, but for all 
Lyn’s abaptability she could barely 
adjust to her surrender in the

evening and her betrayal before 
breakfast. 

Standing nude in the bushes ten 
yards upstream from Amal, she 
was vaguely disturbed by the scene. 
The moon hanging low above the 
line of trees on the eastern shore of 
the mill pond, the silvery path 
shining on the water, the lap of 
wavelets on the bank all 
contributed to lend to the night an 
unreal and, she had to admit, 
fairylike quality. 

, “Last one in’s a bum,” Amal 
shouted from downstream and his 
body shot from the underbrush to 
arch into the water with a rippling 
splash. Lyn dove. California in 
April was not Florida in July and 
the icy water brought her splut- 
tering and gasping to the surface to 
see Amal ten yards into the pond 
cleaving toward the opposite shore 
with ease and power that belittled 
her own proficiency as a swimmer. 
Using an Australian crawl, she fell 
into his wake, feeling her blood 
resume its flow as she swam toward 
the opposite shore. 

He was waiting in the shallows, 
standing higher out of the water 
than modesty would permit her to 
do. He called to her, “You’ve got a 
good crawl. How’s you back 
stroke?” 

“Quite revealing. I’m onto your 
tricks, boy.” 

“Let’s go up the shore a ways and 
race toward the dam,” he sug- 
gested. “Swimming diagonally will 
give us a hundred-meter course.” 



“Give me a handicap,” she 
pleaded. “You undulate through 
the water like a dolphin. How did 
you learn to swim so well in a 
desert?” 

“At the Baghdad Y.M. Coptic 
C.A.,” he answered, teeth chat- 
tering. “I swam the Hellespont 
once and almost drowned. I’ll give 
you ten meters head start.” 

She swam to beat him, keeping 
her lead for thirty meters. Hearing 
the swish of his body behind her, 
she knew she was losing and moved 
to block his lane. With his powerful 
stroke he swept around her, beside 
her, and then she had the worst idea 
for winning a race she had had all 
week. She decided to throw him off 
his stroke with a rolling thigh 
brush. 

Shifting to a side-arm crawl, she 
swung to brush him just as he made 
the same maneuver, undulating like 
a porpoise, facing her. As if touched 
by a fairy’s wand, all her latest 
doubts of Amal vanished. Har- 
pooned, she might have drowned in 
three meters of water, from the rap- 
tures of the deep, had it not been for 
Amal’s unorthodox way of doing 
things. Instead of instinctively 
turning face downward, he rolled 
on his back, spinning her in the 
gyre, and swung her aboard him. 

Whether towing or pushing, he 
carried her shoreward with unfet- 
tered backstrokes until his heels 
struck the muck of the shallows. 
Then his arms went around her. He 
cantilevered her to the bank and

bore her, moaning, to the mound to 
break their Epicurean fast. No 
stars fell on replicated Alabama 
that night, but they had traversed 
ten degrees of arc before Lyn again 
opened her eyes. 

Her first coherent words were, 
“I’m still wearing white to my 
wedding.” 

“Of course, dearest. Since I had 
to rescue you from drowning this 
one doesn’t count.” 

“Now what was that secret that 
had you in such a tizzy?” 

“Oh, that. I was concerned about 
the stress readings on the San 
Andreas Fault. I came up with 
equations that proved we should 
have had a great earthquake fifty 
years ago. But the answer was as 
simple and as beautiful as this — ” 

He cupped her breast in his palm 
and the casual intimacy of the 
gesture thrilled her. 

“Magnetic attraction,” he 
continued. “Iron in the fault facings 
is magnetized by the Earth’s mag- 
netic field and the facings are vir- 
tually clamped together. Twin 
magnets.” 

“The field won’t change, will it?” 

“A little, but not enough. .to 
count . .” 

As his sentence began to hesitate 
he grew reflective. She felt again 
the beginning swirl of his 
energies — as if he were the vortex 
of some psychic maelstrom — and 
her desire rose to his. 

“That’s good,” she said, “be- 
cause I’ve forgotten to count.” 



“Don’t tempt me, Lyn. We’ve got 
to save something for the wedding 
night. I have to hurry home to 
strike you off a medal for tonight’s 
effort — above and beyond the call 
of devotion.” 

Well, he should be tired, she de- 
cided, and he had a perfect knack 
for spontaneous compliments. 

AMAL, driving back to the 
x\. Culpepper place, was acutely 
alert and self-questioning. At the 
moment he should have been most 
keenly aware of the girl and the 
night, both had drifted away. He 
had known strange urges before, 
but never at such an inappropriate 
time and in such a powerful and 
counter-motivational manner. His 
actual world had been shoved aside 
by an abstract universe and the shift 
had occurred right after Lyn’s 
question about the Earth’s 
changing magnetic pole. 

Her words had triggered mathe- 
matical responses which leaped at a 
consideration he had ignored in his 
magnetic-bonding theory. Driving 
faster, he wheeled the car to a halt 
beside the Culpepper house and 
even as he entered he was pre- 
figuring equations he had not fed to 
the Cal Tech computer. Inside, he 
lighted the table lamp in his 
bedroom and pulled out his writing 
pad. His mind held a map of 
Southern California with its fault 
fissures drawn like veins from the 
central aorta, the San Andreas 
Fault. 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE

He awakened Lyn and the 
Emersons before breakfast and 
violated a place-time taboo by 
gathering them in the parlor to hear 
the first true prediction of a great 
earthquake, illustrated by unintelli- 
gible charts drawn crudely on tablet 
paper. Before she was fully awake 
Lyn understood the urgency in his 
manner — strong enough to make 
him overlook completely her lack 
of makeup — although she never 
fully understood the reasons. 

At 1:33 p.m., May 5th, 2062, less 
than two weeks away, the San 
Andreas Fault in the area of Palm- 
dale would slip. All indications 
pointed to a great earthquake — 
still, Amal hedged his prediction. 

His theory, as she understood it, 
held that a temporary fluctuation in 
the Earth’s magnetic field would be 
caused by a solar eclipse passing 
too far to the south to be seen from 
the United States. Aligning the 
gravitation pull of thq Earth and 
the moon, the eclipse would create 
what Amal termed “a spring tide in 
the Earth’s magnetic bulge.” 

Sleepily Lyn asked, “Why 
haven’t all solar eclipses been 
followed by earthquakes?” 

“For various reasons — the 
tension on the earth’s crust, the 
alignment of the fault lines with the 
magnetic field, the zigzag of the 
fault lines. But major quakes have 
come after eclipses. Mayan legend 
tells of a day the earth shook and 
the sky darkened. The same’s been 
said of the day Christ died. We 



have reason to believe that Julius 
Caesar was killed shortly before an 
earthquake-eclipse.” 

“But what puts Palmdale at the 
epicenter?” 

“There,” he said, turning a page 
in his tablet. She could see a flow of 
arrows indicating that the magnetic 
shift paralleled a segment of the 
fault line near Palmdale. “When 
the field shifts at this point there’ll 
be no magnetic bonding along the 
fault line — here. This section will 
snap and drop like a guillotine. If 
the fault face doesn’t hold at this 
point — ” he pointed to a zag in the 
fault line near Victorville — “the in- 
terface will shift from Palmdale 
through the Imperial Valley. Most 
of Southern California and upper 
Baja will be convulsed. A seven 
point five would snap some of the 
modules from the tower stanchions. 
An eight point five on the Richter 
Scale has ten times the force of a 
seven point five. With a quake of 
any magnitude higher than eight 
point five, the populated part of 
Southern California would be 
riding the back of a stampeding 
elephant.” 

“What about our little house?” 
Mrs. Emerson asked. 

“Far safer than any tower,” 
Amal assured her. “Still, you’d bet- 
ter get outside at one thirty-three, a 
week from Wednesday, and stay 
away from your chimney until the 
aftershocks subside.” 

“Then I’ll go get breakfast,” 
Mrs. Emerson said.

Dilsey, Lyn knew, was taking the 
day off to get ready for a Saturday- 
night date. 

“We’ve been assured by our 
government,” Lyn said to Amal, 
“that the towers are earthquake 
proof.” 

“Official gobbledegook,” he said, 
raising his arm to demonstrate a 
point. “The stanchions will stand. 
They’re structural steel. But when 
they sway — like this — the modules 
will be forced outward on one side, 
breaking the shear pins which hold 
them to the extension beams. The 
tower sways back, compressing the 
pods and breaking the shear pins on 
the opposite side. It sways again. 
The plastisteel modules have plastic 
memory. They snap back to their 
original form. The uppermost 
single-girder apartment pods will 
be shot from the tower in the same 
way a boy expels a watermelon seed 
from between his thumb and fore- 
finger. Those upper pods at right 
angles to the line of sway will be 
shaken from their support beams 
and fall. All the upper griders will 
be stripped bare of all but the top- 
most pod anchored on the tip of the 
tower — if it’s a high-magnitude 
quake.” 

“But you’re not sure it will be a 
high-magnitude quake?” 

“Not if the fault line holds at Vic- 
torville. But the prudent approach 
is to prepare for a killer quake, 
evacuate the towers, cut the power 
on the freeway guide bands and the 
magnetic rings on the railroads. 



assemble food, water and medical 
supplies and theoretically figure on 
the total destruction and isolation 
of Los Angeles. We’ve got to get to 
Doctor Kley immediately.” 

T ! HOUGH she could barely 
comprehend the disaster he en- 
visioned, she knew from experience 
the problem of obtaining govern- 
mental response to a problematical 
disaster. At least once a week she 
diverted from Dr. Kley an urgent 
warning to prepare the city for the 
end of the world or the Second 
Coming or both. Amal was not a 
crackpot but Dr. Kley would not 
know it. If he acted on Amal’s 
recommendations and the Victor- 
ville segment held he would be the 
laughing stock of the city and his 
political career would be ruined. 

An Arabian could not be ex- 
pected to understand the complexi- 
ties of the American political 
system. 

Still dazed by Amal’s prediction, 
Lyn said, “I suppose I could locate 
Doctor Kley this morning. But the 
Board of Supervisors will have to 
rule on your petition which will 
have to be drawn up by a lawyer 
and submitted to Doctor Kley.” 
“How long does this take?” 
“Usually a week or ten days, but 
we can request an emergency 
hearing. I have a friend at U.S.C., 
Red Benton, who might draw up 
the petition over the weekend.” 
“What is this Board of Super- 
visors?” 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE 



67 




“An ad hoc committee Doctor 
Kley appoints from the various city 
departments.” 

“I’ll be a Greek speaking to 
Romans,” Amal said. “What I’ve 
been telling you would challenge an 
expert in Gausian and Reisman 
mathematics who is also an au- 
thority on unified field equations.” 
“The board provides a math-to- 
English interpreter, a retired 
mathematics teacher from Los 
Angeles City College.” 

“God help him — and us,” Amal 
exploded. “When is the earliest I 
can present the petition?” 

“I should think Tuesday. Com- 
mittee appointees have to be no- 
tified.” 

“Too late,” Amal groaned. 

“The mills of the government 
grind slowly,” Mr. Emerson in- 
toned, “and they grind exceedingly 
coarse.” 

“There have to be deliberations,” 
Lyn explained. “There are proce- 
dures to follow. You would have to 
be checked out, your background 
verified. Doctor Kley would be 
risking his career if he attempted to 
railroad a matter of this nature 
through the committee.” 

“The only authority who could 
possibly interest Doctor Kley is 
Doctor Reynolds, the head of the 
seismology department at Cal 
Tech. Once he gives Kley my cre- 
dentials the hearing should be 
granted in a hurry.” 

“But what about today’s auto 
race?” 



“Lyn, the time for fun and games 
is over. This earthquake is no 
staged spectacular. Real people will 
die real deaths.” 

Later she realized it was Amal’s 
casual reference to spectaculars 
which gave her the idea for saving 
the lives of Angelenos, but at the 
moment she was shaken by his 
reference to fun and games. 

“Do you also consider our mar- 
riage as nothing more than fun and 
games?” 

Immediately his tone softened. 
“Darling, we’ll be married — in 
Dotham — the Saturday after the 
earthquake. Only a week’s delay.” 

“Breakfast is ready, folks,” Mrs. 
Emerson announced from the 
hallway. Lyn turned toward the 
dining room, Amal moving beside 
her. Someone, she recalled, had 
once said that all romances ended 
in tragedy. Her romance with Amal 
was beginning with one. 

S URPRISINGLY, to Lyn, the 
hearing was granted as quickly 
as Amal had anticipated. Dr. 
Kley’s teletracer located him in a 
Bunker Hill Leisure World 
apartment and though he sounded 
sleepy he was in a splendid mood. 
Apparently he called Dr. Reynolds 
immediately to check Amal’s quali- 
fications, for he called Lyn back at 
her apartment, where she and Amal 
were waiting, within fifteen 
minutes. He told her to round up a 
quorum from the list of twenty-four 
standby supervisors and set the 



68 



GALAXY 




hearing for Monady afternoon. 

Still, there was the petition to be 
written. Lyn telephoned Red 
Benton and he came down im- 
mediately from his pod three floors 
above. Amal quickly converted the 
lanky redhead — all one hundred 
and sixty-six freckled centimeters 
of him — into a believer, although 
Red, for reasons Lyn would later 
come to understand, persisted in re- 
ferring to “this alleged earth- 
quake.” 

Red called Hal Carpenter, a 
graduate journalism major, from 
the floors below to help Amal 
prepare his oral petition to the 
supervisors. Deft, quick-witted, 
opinionated and a little too cynical 
for Lyn’s tastes, Hal lacked Amal’s 
flair for metaphor, but he had a gift 
for simple, pungent speech that lent 
clarity to Amal’s concepts. 

Between typing Red’s petition 
and Calling standby supervisors — 
she found the necessary six — Lyn 
received a solid grounding in 
geophysics, law and communica- 
tions. 

From Amal she learned of earth- 
quake sound waves, shear waves 
and long waves designated P, S, 
and L. Hal Carpenter, planning 
what he termed an “inhuman inter- 
est” news story on the mechanics 
of earthquakes, promptly dubbed 
them shake, rattle and roll waves. 
She learned from Hal that a wire 
story could be so coded that every 
student editor would print it even if 
it meant a “roust by the blukes,” 



archaic slang for an investigation 
by the bluecoats, or police. From 
Red Benton she was surprised to 
find that, under the provisions of 
the California Law and Order 
Codes — an addenda to the pre- Ho- 
locaust Riot and Civil Turmoil 
Act — an earthquake prediction was 
in the same category as that of the 
bomb threats which had caused 
such a problem in the heyday of 
transcontinental air travel. 

To anyone as interested in 
governmental processes as Lyn the 
conversation in the room was little 
short of thrilling. She regretted the 
necessary rattle of her stenotyper as 
she listened. The customs and tradi- 
tions of U.S. democracy came alive 
and the body of laws aimed at 
student subversives hung like a rich 
tapestry behind the conversations. 

Never before had she been so 
busily engaged in such meaningful 
group activity, spiced as it was by 
the hint of personal risk. From Red 
she learned that their activities, if 
pursued without legal sanction, 
would have opened them all to 
charges of conspiracy. 

They took a break for lunch and 
Red ordered them to keep their 
voices low on the basis of some 
vague provision against spreading 
earthquake rumors. His warning 
served only to increase the air of ex- 
citement hanging over their table. 
From these talks, Lyn realized, 
might issue decrees that would set 
huge buses rolling to evacuate the 
population and stanchion cranes to

lower the uppermost pods to the 
ground. 

When she expressed her vision 
Hal Carpenter voiced strong 
doubts. 

“The political mind operates in a 
vacuum. The most we can hope for 
is to get Amal’s prediction legally 
before the public. When he makes 
his prediction at the hearing the 
proceedings will constitute priv- 
ileged material. If he makes the 
prediction strong enough the 
metropolitan media will publish it.” 

“Oh, Hal,” she said. “You’re 
being the cynical journalist. Every 
citizen is given a fair hearing.” 

“And then told to blow,” Hal 
said. “Besides, Amal’s no citizen.” 

“All the more reason the super- 
visors will listen,” she rebutted. 
“He’s a stateless neutral with no ax 
to grind.” 

“Don’t subvert Lyn,” Red said to 
Hal. “We may need her later as a 
listening post. You’ve got to relate 
Amal’s oral plea with the solar 
eclipse — over and over. Afterward 
every news story about the eclipse 
will recall his prediction to the 
public’s mind.” 

So it went, the molding and 
shaping of a plea and its publicity. 
Lyn noticed a peculiar phenom- 
enon. Her actual presence had 
aroused no libidinal currents at the 
table. She wondered if their 
concentration or her diamond ring 
was keeping their thoughts chaste. 

An unpleasant note intruded on 
the end of their break. A television 



news flash announced a mine 
disaster near Johannesburg, South 
Africa. Five thousand miners were 
known dead. Lyn did not catch the 
full story — something about a new 
laser tunneling device which had 
curved upward to bore in the wrong 
direction, undermining the main 
supporting pillars for three galleries 
above, causing a huge cave-in. 

One graphic closeup showed an 
English-speaking black miner, 
hollow-eyed from shock, who kept 
repeating, “Impossible. Impossible. 
One meter either way and the main 
stanchions would have held, but he 
got three of them.” 

The miner’s “he” referred to a 
young Afrikander laser engineer, 
inventor of the tunneling device, 
who had been killed in the cave-in. 

O N MONDAY, April 26, 2062, 
at one p.m., in the presence of 
witnesses, a plea was entered before 
a committee of supervisors. City of 
Los Angeles, at the City Hall, by 
Amal E. Severn, seismologist, 
requesting that the city be 
evacuated by reason of an alleged 
earthquake, possibly major, on 
Wednesday, May 5, 2062. Hearing 
the petitioner in addition to 
the chairman. Dr. Kley, were 
Howebrand, representing the de- 
partment of public spectaculars; 
Paul, of finance; Washington, of 
engineering; Hagenbeck, of power; 
Calvin, of Transport and Jeffers, of 
police. In official attendance were 
Dr. Westover Baum, interpreter.

and Miss Lyn Oberlin, secretary. 

In the beginning Amal . spoke 
with ease and clarity. He pin- 
pointed on a map the area of the 
San Andreas Fault where sensor 
readings showed greatest stress, 
explained his magnetic-bonding 
theory, then grew slightly too 
technical, Lyn thought, in 
describing the local change in the 
Earth’s magnetic field created by 
the core shift during the solar 
eclipse. 

Baum was not called on to in- 
terpret. He could not have, Lyn 
knew. He was still struggling with 
the bonding theory while Amal dis- 
cussed the unified field equations 
which explained the core shift. 

Amal placed the epicenter of the 
earthquake in a stretch of fault two 
thousand meters below Cal 
Edison’s Palmdale plant tunnel 
leading from mohole five — the tun- 
nel itself was six thousand meters 
below the surface. The supervisors 
listened intently until the question 
period, at which time Amal was no 
longer guided by the carefully pre- 
pared text of Hal Carpenter and 
Red Benton. 

Hagenbeck asked, “Are the 
atomic generating plants of the 
Antelope Valley in danger?’’ 

“Yes, sir. Atomic pile five would 
be taken out by a six point five. A 
seven would disrupt the power flow 
from the entire Apple Valley- 
Lancaster string.’’ 

Ten per cent of the city’s power 
supply might be knocked out, Lyn 



saw Hagenbeck think. As the 
audience, mostly newsmen, well 
knew, there was no danger of an 
atomic explosion since any disrup- 
tion of the laser control to the 
steam generators would cause the 
gravity-controlled cadmium rods to 
sink into the piles and dampen all 
emission. 

Calvin, of transportation, asked 
about the freeways north of the 
city. 

“If the coming temblor’s a seven 
it will shatter the Ridge Route in 
the Frazier Park-Tejon area. An 
eight will break all the guide bands 
north because of the poor quality of 
their bedding.” 

Lyn flinched. Calvin had per- 
sonally let contracts for laying 
several of the guide bands. 

“How can you assert the bedding 
for the guide bands is of poor 
quality?” Calvin bored in. 

“The specifications call for a 
non-resilient concrete.” 

Calvin thanked him. Amal had 
removed the onus from trans- 
portation and placed it on 
engineering where specifications 
were drawn. 

Amal again impugned the 
engineering department when asked 
about the area of greatest danger, 
the city’s towers. “Care was put 
into the stanchion design, but the 
plastic memory of the attached 
apartment modules was over- 
looked.” 

Washington had been a child 
when the towers were erected, but 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE

Amal’s remark still reflected on his 
department. 

“You speak of the ‘coming 
quake,’ ” the supervisor remarked 
with some irritation. “Are you 
making an unqualified prediction?” 

“Yes,” Amal answered firmly. 
“The quake will occur at one thirty- 
three on the afternoon of May fifth, 
during the apex of the core shift 
caused by the solar eclipse. For that 
reason I’m compelled to invite the 
committee’s attention to the feasi- 
bility of evacuating all towers and 
closing all roads and railroads on 
May fifth.” 

Kley glanced at his watch and 
rapped the gavel. 

“The committee thanks the peti- 
tioner for his zeal and devotion and 
requests that he submit his exhibits 
to the committee for in-chamber 
deliberations. If the public desires 
to wait, the committee’s decision 
will be forthcoming at two p.m.” 

In less than fifteen minutes. Kley 
was herding the committee at a 
gallop. He had a golfing date with 
the widow at 2:30, Lyn read in his 
thoughts, but haste might be to 
Amal’s advantage. The hostilities 
he had aroused would not have time 
to harden and the newsmen would 
not get bored and leave before the 
decision was announced. 

I YN’S receptors picked up little 
of the committee members’ 
feelings in the chamber. Drowning 
out all others, Westover Baum’s 
confusion was the strongest emo- 



tion in the room. Kley ignored the 
exhibits and called for the mathe- 
matician’s opinion. 

“I can assure you, Mr. 
Chairman, the reasoning was quite 
beyond me, but the boy’s 
imagination should be taken 
seriously.” 

Kley thanked him and excused 
him. Once Baum’s signals ceased, 
Lyn took her seat against the wall 
to concentrate on the more subdued 
readings from the committee 
members. 

Kley sat at the head of the table, 
Amal’s charts unread before him. 
A bowl for holding the black and 
white balls of acceptance or re- 
jection of the petition was in the 
center of the table. Recording 
equipment readied, Lyn had a 
straight-on view of Washington, 
Howebrand, and Jeffers, whose 
faces she could study unobserved. 

“Committee members,” Kley 
said, “obviously our young peti- 
tioner has too excellent a mathe- 
matical imagination to be dis- 
missed. As you know, if I close the 
roads and evacuate the towers I’ll 
open the city to countless law suits 
from litigious merchants, salesmen, 
innkeepers and commuters. If you 
decide to close the roads and 
evacuate the towers and offer me as 
a sacrificial lamb I’ll be convinced 
that you erred on the side of 
prudence. If you consider the risks 
great enough to jeopardize the 
city’s budget, so vote, and I’ll issue

for five minutes and then vote.” 

Delivered with sincerity and a 
smile, Kley’s instructions were both 
pro and con the petition, Lyn 
recognized. He was throwing the 
decision to the committee. Lyn 
focused her receptors on the faces 
she could see. 

Her thin lips pursed in con- 
centration, Supervisor Washington 
resembled a Nubian chief more 
than a black woman. Lyn read: Sell 
my Cal Ed stock and reinvest in 
Forest Lawn. Buy ticket to 
Bahamas — blackball whitey. 

The equine face of Jeffers, pro 
tempore supervisor and permanent 
chief of police, was concerned with 
administrative problems: Tactical 
riot squads training for weeks... 
find out what they’ve learned- 
need crowds for riots.. .fishing trip 
the fifth... other side Catalina.. .tidal 
wave... 

Lyn focused her attention on 
Howebrand, of spectaculars. 
Wearing dark glasses, plaid coat, 
his long hair dyed black, the 
producer was in the right area but 
the wrong era as his thoughts 
revealed: Pan shots from 

whirlybirds over the towers. 
ground cameras at fault lines for 
auto crashes. .be airborne by 
noon. .splice the footage into a 
Howebrand production. 

When Kley rapped his gavel and 
the balls dropped from clenched 
fists into the bowl, Lyn’s three- 
member survey had convinced her 
that the most Amal could hope for 



was a split vote to be decided by the 
chairman. Kley drew the bowl 
toward him, glanced in and drop- 
ped a white ball. 

Lyn knew by the chairman’s open 
vote that Amal’s petition was 
denied. If the quake struck and the 
modules fell, Lyn’s record would 
show that the chairman had voted 
to evacuate and he could stand on 
his record. If only a minor temblor 
struck, the vote would be forgotten. 

“Lyn,” Kley said, “would you 
announce that the petition has been 
denied by a vote of four blacks to 
three whites. Henceforward any 
earthquake prediction has the 
status of a rumor deleterious to 
public serenity.” He turned and 
smiled for her alone, “Of course the 
prediction will be printed in the 
newspapers as a part of the hearing 
proceedings, so your man’s pur- 
poses will have been served.” 

Kley was the consummate pol- 
itician, she realized, as she 
returned to the hearing room to 
make the announcement. Everyone 
had gotten a bit of what they 
wanted in a typical compromise by 
the Great Pacificator. 

VI 

T O herself Lyn could justify the 
decision of the committee — 
Amal’s prediction had been 
equivocal and she herself half- 
believed his phobia was making 
him overreact. There had been few 
great earthquakes in California, the

last in 1906. Amal, she felt, might 
be yielding to the Arab’s tendency 
to believe his own metaphor — and 
no one had demonstrated that his 
abstruse mathematics were more. 

Yet she could not justify the vote 
of the three supervisors whose 
minds she had read as anything* 
other than disgraceful. Whatever 
their official opinions, they had 
been personally convinced by 
Amal’s words, at least enough to 
provide for their own safety, yet 
they had banned his prediction 
from the public. 

At the meeting in the city hall’s 
automat, where she, Amal, Red 
and Hal gathered to hear the 2:30 
news bulletin, hold a post mortem 
on the death of their petition and 
plan their next step, she kept silent. 
The fragments of thoughts she had 
picked up at the deliberations were 
not true indications of the super- 
visors’ final reasoning processes 
and to mention those thoughts 
would involve self-revelations she 
had trained herself to conceal. 

The conversation over coffee was 
surprisingly free of rancor. Red 
held that supporting authority from 
other Cal Tech seismologists might 
have carried the petition. The city 
could not finance a mass exodus 
into the surrounding deserts on the 
unsupported prediction of a 
graduate student, but a verification 
by a committee of seismologists, 
would put the prediction beyond 
rumor and into the public domain 
as a scientific truth. Anyone 



spreading the rumor thereafter, 
would not be liable to a conspiracy 
charge. 

“What is this ‘conspiracy?’ ” 
Amal asked Red. 

“Two or more persons conspiring 
to break a law or breach a city ordi- 
nance — such as spreading a rumor 
deleterious to public serenity.” 

“How can we spread a rumor 
without spreading a rumor?” 

“By publicity given to a priv- 
ileged statement,” Hal Carpenter 
said. “Television will help. When 
the late news editions hit the street 
the prediction will be spelled out on 
the front page. From then on, 
whenever an Angeleno hears, Solar 
eclipse, he’ll think. Earthquake." 

“There’s more to it than a predic- 
tion,” Amal said. “More to it than 
just walking out of a tower. In fact, 
if you walk in the wrong direction 
from the tower you’ll be killed by 
the falling pods. Then there’s the 
matter of water, food and supplies 
for three days — plus a prayer 
book.” 

“Why isn’t the truth a defense 
against rumor?” Lyn asked. 

“Truth is a defense against rumor 
mongering,” Red answered. “But 
conspiracy stands on its own legs. If 
two conspire to monger a rumor 
banned by law — and if the rumor 
proves true — the charge of rumor 
mongering is dropped but the cons- 
piracy charge still stands.” 

“What a stupid law,” Lyn said. 

“It’s not stupid at all viewed his- 
torically,” Red said, sounding 



74 



GALAXY 




piqued. “During the population 
sink, spreading a rumor wa§ the 
preferred method of starting a race 
riot. Once the riot started, the 
rumor was true, but the rumor 
started the riot. Earthquake predic- 
tions were used by land speculators 
in early California to lower real 
estate values.” 

“Treat us to the history some 
other time. Counselor,” Amal 
snapped. “Right now, what can we 
legally do to clear the towers on 
May fifth?” 

“Take a stroll in the park,” Red 
said. 

“To get a front seat for the mass 
slaughter?” 

Hal turned to Lyn. “Quaker 
SHAKES CITY HALL — what do you 
think of that as a headline to my 
story?” 

“1 would think it a religious 
story,” she answered. 

Red was still thinking. 

“Hal could write a series of arti- 
cles for the school papers outlining 
what to do in the event of a killer 
quake — ” 

“And bind them into a 
pamphlet,” Lyn inserted. 

“How many students read the 
school newspapers?” Amal asked 
Hal. 

“The latest poll shows thirty- 
eight per cent. The general public 
never sees them. However, if I 
could make the articles interesting 
enough the metro papers might 
copy. A student at Miami won a 
Pulitzer Prize for Journalism with a 



series of articles on a hurricane, al- 
though he wrote them after the 
event — Here’s the news and our 
opening blast.” 

They turned to the life-sized 
screen in a darkened corner of the 
automat to watch the image of 
Happy Jack Harrison. Before he 
spoke they could sense his ex- 
citement and his normally high- 
pitched voice was up an octave as 
the staccato speech that was his 
trademark rolled through the room. 

H APPY JACK’S excitement 
was over an explosion in the 
University of Madrid’s exotic fuels 
laboratory which had leveled most 
of the campus and four blocks of 
flats in the old city nearby. A young 
chemical engineer, Armando 
Sietro, had been formulating an 
ionic propellant for spacecraft 
when a vat had inexplicably ignited. 
The death toll, it was estimated, 
would eventually top 17,000. 

Squeezed into the last minute of 
the broadcast was the simple an- 
nouncement, “Today at city hall a 
petition to evacuate the city on 
May fifth because of an expected 
earthquake was denied. The latest 
prediction was made by Armando 
Severn, a Cal Tech student.” 

He had confused Amal’s name 
with Armando Sietro’s. 

“I like that ‘latest prediction,’ ” 
Red said to Hal. “You journalists 
are versatile. You can editorialize 
and get your facts wrong in one 
sentence.” 



75 




“He got rattled,” Hal said, 
“when a natural spectacular hit the 
news. So there goes our front page 
story — and my Pulitzer Prize.” 

A memory in Lyn’s mind formed 
into a suggestion. “Why don’t we 
produce a spectacular about a great 
earthquake in Los Angeles and put 
it on the road? It would reach a 
large audience and no one would 
realize it was an educational 
documentary.” 

“We’re not producers.” Amal 
turned to Hal. “Isn’t there some 
way we can reach a mass audience 
with a written record?” 

“In the old days there used to be 
an underground press that printed 
all the news not fit to print 
elsewhere. It reached a tremendous 
audience.” 

“Indeed it did,” Lyn said, re- 
membering history. “A large 
audience of sex-oriented perverts, 
deviates and voluptuaries.” 

“Which is about eighty per cent 
of the population,” Hal said. 
“Present company excepted.” 
“Hold it a minute,” Red Benton 
said. “Lyn’s idea of a spectacular is 
worth thinking about. I know a girl 
in the cinema department at U.S.C. 
who has a genius for that sort of 
thing. If we’re careful not to 
mention the solar eclipse a docu- 
mentary would stay within the let- 
ter of the ban.” 

“You two talk it over,” Amal 
said. “I want to speak to Hal 
privately.” 

He and Hal got up and moved to 



a table out of earshot of Red and 
Lyn, who wondered aloud, “Now, 
what are those two planning?” 

“A picnic in the park on May 
fifth, I assume — and I’m being very 
careful not to find out. If I 
knowingly assisted a client in 
breaking the law I could be 
disbarred.” 

His use of the word “client” 
aroused her suspicions. Amal had 
retained Red Benton without telling 
her and now he was speaking to Hal 
Carpenter in secret. Vexed and sud- 
denly worried, she looked over at 
their table. Amal’s back was to her 
but Hal’s face was plainly visible. 
She studied Hal’s face. , 

From the widening of his eyes, a 
slight recoil to his shoulders, she 
could tell he had been frightened by 
something Amal had told him. A 
shift of his eyes to the left indicated 
a private fear had struck him. His 
jaw muscles tightened, his 
shoulders squared and he leaned 
forward, suddenly resolute, lis- 
tening intently to Amal. 

All the minute clues she read 
came together in her mind to form 
the insights which set her apart. 
Amal had said that possibly a 
million lives — the figure leaped 
clearly into her mind — were at 
stake unless Hal organized an 
underground press to publicize the 
prediction. On that possibility, 
knowing that his journalistic career 
would be destroyed by a jail 
sentence, Hal had acceeded to 
Amal’s proposal. 



76 



GALAXY 




One million lives! Amal had 
never mentioned such casualties to 
her. She turned to face Red Benton, 
smiling to hide her shock, and 
found him looking at her with 
amused speculation. 

“You were reading their lips. 
You were so intent your head was 
cocked in the listening attitude of 
the blind.” 

“But Hal said nothing.” She 
smiled, shrugged. “Now who is this 
wizard you know in the cinema 
department?” 

“Gloria Jaffee.” 

“Her!” 

“Oh, I know she’s a beautiful 
redhead — ” 

“Out of a bottle.” 

“But she has talents.” 

“She’s man-hungry.” 

“That’s one of her talents. But 
don’t worry about Amal. He won’t 
even see her. He’s an earthquake 
monomaniac.” 

She had diverted Red’s thoughts 
from her alleged lip-reading, but 
Red had diluted her anticipation 
over an earthquake epic with his 
choice of producers. Now she 
would have to work with one eye on 
Amal who was returning with an 
obviously subdued and thoughtful 
Hal Carpenter. 

“Here’s the plan,” Amal said, 
still standing. “We’ll produce The 
Fall of Los Angeles at Cal Tech. 
Hal will go ahead with his articles 
for the student papers. In both, 
we’ll keep to the letter of the law. 
Red, you can ride herd on us, there. 



Lyn, you get started on a scenario 
about the psychological effects of 
earthquakes. Let’s go over to Lyn’s 
apartment and round up a produc- 
tion unit. We’ll need cinema ma- 
jors, medical students, engineers, 
the lot. Working around the clock, 
we can get the show on the road by 
Thursday.” 

There was no doubt about who 
was in charge of production, Lyn 
thought as she arose — the com- 
manding general was “Armando” 
Severn, as Happy Jack Harrison 
had called him. The commentator’s 
error had been rather logical, it oc- 
cured to her. There was a vague 
similarity between “Amal” and 
“Armando,” the young Spanish 
chemical engineer whose formula 
had caused the catastrophe in 
Madrid. 



E VERYONE deferred to Amal, 
but Gloria Jaffee was positively 
unctuous. She swept in and out of 
Lyn’s apartment as if she owned it, 
constantly conferring with Amal on 
minor details. From the way she 
brushed past him in the crowded 
rooms or slung her pelvis slightly 
forward when she talked, Lyn de- 
cided that Gloria Jaffee was a mis- 
placed ding-a-ling belle from the 
1930s. 

Amal was a driver, working them 
all to what he called “the 
quintessential nubbin.” He seemed 
to move to prestructured patterns, 
knowing in advance what problems 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE

would arise and having already 
thought out their solutions. He got 
three hours’ sleep on Lyn’s sofa, 
Monday night, generously permit- 
ting her an extra half-hour while he 
showered and shaved. 

He also spent Tuesday night on 
her sofa. Obliquely she realized 
how odd it was to be virtually living 
with the man she loved, at times al- 
most sharing the same shower, 
when all the romance his schedule 
permitted was a quick kiss as a 
nightcap and a quicker one to wake 
her up. As fatigued as Amal kept 
her, she did not complain. 

Despite his nearness he seemed to 
have a conspiracy afoot which ex- 
cluded her. When he talked to Red 
he went alone to Red’s apartment. 
When he had to go to Cal Tech to 
talk to the grips and cameramen 
Hal Carpenter always drove him. 

On Wednesday evening, three 
days after its inception, the finally 
tilted Los Angeles — the Last Day 
was previewed in the Cal Tech 
dome. In a gesture Lyn hoped was 
sentimental, Amal reserved the 
table where she and he had been 
first introduced by Nils Larsen. 

“Why isn’t Nils here?” Lyn 
asked him. 

“I didn’t invite him,” Amal 
answered in a tone that stopped 
further questions. 

Tonight, in addition to Hal 
Carpenter, they were companioned 
by Red Benton who had dropped in 
Lyn’s opinion. Red had cut her 
name from the list of credits as 



technical advisor. He had also de- 
leted Amal’s name and given 
Gloria Jaffee top billing as 
producer. He feared the dramatic 
documentary might draw a re- 
classification hearing, he said, and 
he did not want Lyn or Amal in- 
volved. Privately she suspected him 
of using his position to habeas the 
corpus of Gloria Jaffee. 

T HE house lights dimmed. 

From concealed apertures in- 
visible rays from infrared and ul- 
traviolet cameras activated the rare 
earth prisms imbedded in the 
pleasure dome’s circular wall and 
ceiling. Overhead the sky became 
blue and dotted with clouds. The air 
grew brisk and pine scented. 
Around the spectators, birds twit- 
tered and behind them rose the 
white building of Mount Wilson 
Observatory on whose dining ter- 
race the audience now sat. Below, 
to the southwest, rose the towers of 
Los Angeles, golden in the late 
morning air. 

“This is the city, Los Angeles, 
California,” a voice announced. 
“We live here.” 

At the very opening, Gloria Jaf- 
fee introduced a corny bit of stage 
business. During pauses in the 
measured cadence of the voice, the 
Altadena vortex emitted smoke 
rings of smog into the high at- 
mosphere, a creaking symbol that 
Los Angeles still lived. 

Fortunately the audience was im- 
mediately levitated toward the city, 



78 



GALAXY 




but as it floated past the Cal Tech 
tower there was a rush of air and a 
blurring of surrounding scenery as 
the camera zoomed in on the Civic 
Center. Since the audience sat in 
the lens of the camera, there were 
delighted shrieks at “the roller- 
coaster effect,” a completely worn- 
out cinematic cliche. 

The Civic Center towers ma- 
terialized, circumambient, soaring 
above an audience now lunching in 
the Civic Center Mall. The an- 
nouncer was listing dry statistics 
about Los Angeles, its population, 
the gross weight of liquids and 
solids it consumed daily, its au- 
tomated subway system, its waste 
disposal facilities, the air purifi- 
cation system. Against this matter- 
of-fact tabulation, in a genuinely 
dramatic contrast Amal must have 
suggested, a forlorn howl arose 
from the pet park south of the cafe. 
The announcer paused. His voice 
seemed to be listening. 

“An animal can hear the P waves 
of an earthquake,” the voice said. 
“The L waves are coming.” 

Pigeons were fluttering from the 
sidewalk. Sparrows launched 
themselves from the plastic trees of 
the mall. The sound of the dogs and 
the flight of the birds brought an 
apprehension into the dome so op- 
pressive that the spectators at the 
tables turned and looked at each 
other. 

A metallic humming became au- 
dible, rising above the barking of 
the dogs into the sound of a mil- 



lion steel guitars vibrating through 
amplifiers. 

“S waves are causing the modules 
to resonate against each other on 
the stanchions,” the voice 
explained. “The L waves are 
coming. Will the link pins hold the 
pods to the towers when the stan- 
chions sway? Shall we on the patio 
outlive this minute?” 

The voice projected fear. Its 
listeners caught and amplified it. In 
the ambience of the rising panic, 
Lyn, who knew from the script that 
the link pins would not hold, bowed 
her head to pray that the link pins 
would hold as the first L wave 
struck and the towers swayed. 

Her eyes fell on Amal. His face 
was ashen. His eyes were wild and 
his hands were gripping the table’s 
edge. Despite his phobia, Amal had 
come here to challenge his 
madness. His courage steadied 
hers. Nearby someone screamed 
and dove under a table. 

The pods above the fifteenth 
floors, were breaking and teetering 
outward, snapped from their 
stanchions. 

As the towers rolled upright a 
second L wave struck, whipping the 
stanchions like saplings in a sudden 
gust, but these saplings soared four 
hundred meters into the sky and 
their leaves were modules weighing 
six thousand kilos apiece. The snap 
of the second roll produced the 
squirting watermelon seeds effect. 
On the lower levels the pods were 
thrown outward on gentle arcs. 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE 



79 




From the upper levels, the modules 
were hurled outward and the sky 
was filled with pods. 

From out of the chaos in the sky, 
Lyn spotted a huge, pie-slice wedge 
tumbling toward her, the apex of its 
triangle pointed directly at her. As 
she watched the juggernaut hurtle 
down, logic told her the illusion 
would fade at the ceiling of the 
dome, but the pods were not fading 
into the ceiling. Synchronized holo- 
graphic extensions of the film cap- 
tured the images as they struck the 
ceiling and brought them down. 

The pods hit the patio. 

She was on her feet, screaming 
when the hologram materialized 
around her. Rising, Amal grabbed 
her, shouting above the din, “Con- 
trol yourself, Lyn. It’s only an 
illusion.” 

The illusion did not fade. Amid 
the grinding roar of shattering steel 
and crunching concrete, the snap 
and twang of cracking pods, the 
recorded screams of the wounded 
and dying and the real screams 
from the terror-stricken audience, 
plastifoam blocks came tumbling 
from the walls. An odor of 
powdered concrete was emitted 
from the scent ducts. 

From the stage the severed head 
of an aged gynodrone shot from a 
pod and bounced down the aisle, 
stopping at Lyn’s feet. Its gray hair 
was matted with blood, its eyes 
bulging. Jerking her gaze from the 
grisly object, Lyn looked at the 
stage. 



The illusion was shattered. 

In the mockup of a split pod from 
the Leisure World Tower, she saw a 
tableau bearing unmistakably the 
imprint of Gloria Jaffee. Others 
saw it at the - same time. The 
screams of the audience turned to 
squeals and the squeals to twit- 
tering sniggers. 

I YN had never been touched by 
* the sexual hubris youth holds 
toward age. From her mindreading 
she knew warm winds could blow in 
December. But the scene in the 
mockup was a flagrant artistic flaw. 
Shakespeare used comedy to break 
tensions, she knew, but she ques- 
tioned the taste of a “producer” 
who permitted the realism of a 
simulated earthquake to be marred 
by the spectacle of an octogenarian 
daisy chain. 

Also, she questioned the logic of 
the scene. It was highly unlikely 
that a group orgy would be in 
progress in the Leisure World at 
lunch time, a time when old folks 
would be thinking of organically 
grown food. 

“This was Los Angeles,” the off- 
stage voice intoned. “We lived here. 
We died in the Civic Center. 

“For our survivors, the horror 
now begins. For them the task to 
succor the wounded, to dig out the 
bodies, to preserve their own lives. 
How will this be done? We have 
experts to tell you.” 

As the voice spoke, the offensive 
scene on the stage drew back into 



80 



GALAXY 




the wall. An usher recovered the 
head from the aisle. The recorded 
moans died. The images of the 
stripped towers, the dangling 
pedestrian walkways, faded into an 
abstract. 

As student actors, in holograms, 
were introduced onto the stage, the 
shock of the earthquake simulation 
lingered. Never before in the his- 
tory of higher education, Lyn 
thought, had so many students paid 
such devoted attention to so many 
experts. A doctor lectured on first- 
aid; a laser expert spoke on how to 
find and operate steel-cutting 
lasers. A black student from Watts 
lectured on survival techniques and 
self-defense. Lyn’s own expert, re- 
citing from her now anonymously 
written script, discussed the 
psychological effects of earth- 
quakes. 

At Lyn’s table they discussed the 
production in low voices and Lyn’s 
complaint about the Leisure World 
sex scene was voted down. 

“It’s flakey,” Amal admitted, 
“but it saved you from hysteria.’’ 

“But at lunch time — it’s un- 
natural.’’ 

“That’s the point,” Red Benton 
chimed in. “The scene’s an antidote 
to realism. It snaps you back to 
make-believe.’’ 

“The point is,” Lyn contended, 
“we’re training for reality.” 

She was complaining to closed 
minds. When the house lights came 
on and Red suggested they make a 
public show of complimenting 



Gloria Jaffee along with everyone 
else in the audience Lyn excused 
herself. She had to go to the rest 
room. 

F ROM Thursday through 
Monday Los Angeles — the 
Last Day played to stand-up 
audiences on the thirty-six 
campuses of the Greater Los 
Angeles University Complex. At 
U.S.C. it outdrew The Spirit of 
O. J. Simpson. At Cal State Watts 
it exceeded the gate for Genet’s The 
Blacks — and when it commanded a 
larger audience at Loyola than The 
Crucifixion Gloria Jaffee decided 
to exhibit the spectacular in com- 
mercial houses, proceeds to go to 
the Student Relief Association. 

On the afternoon of Thursday, 
April 29, countercurrents were set 
in motion against the spectacular, 
ostensibly arising out of an incident 
on Thursday morning, when an 
audience at Cal State Fullerton 
panicked and a girl’s arm was 
broken in the stampede. Sensing in 
the incident the forming pattern of 
a mass tragedy. Dr. John 
Heywood, the head of Cal Tech’s 
Department of Experimental 
Genetics and the local director of 
ambulatory experiment seven, took 
steps to limit Amal’s overkill 
potential. He did so reluctantly and 
by a devious method at odds with 
his public character, and he moved 
with a sense of urgency. 

On his desk lay a bulletin from 
Kiev. 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE 



81 




Dr. Heywood called his old and 
beloved creche mother at the 
U.C.L.A. maternity clinic and 
expressed his concern over the 
broken arm at Fullerton. A sensa- 
tional documentary such as Los 
Angeles — the Last Day was a 
threat to the health and welfare of 
the young. 

An expert on conditioned reac- 
tions, Dr. Heywood was con- 
sciously pushing a button. The 
creche mother, aroused by the 
danger, promised to call the 
president of the local chapter of 
Professional Mothers’ Association. 
So it was that late on Thursday 
aftenoon Lyn received a call from 
Dr. Kley asking her to set up 
another emergency hearing, this 
time to present a cease-and-desist 
petition against the showing of Los 
Angeles — the Last Day. The peti- 
tioners were the powerful 
Professional Mothers' Association. 
The petition would be presented by 
James Osborne, the most suc- 
cessful, flamboyant and over- 
dressed attorney in Los Angeles. 

No hint of dismay marred the 
exuberant vitality of Lyn’s voice as 
she talked with Kley, but she was 
calculating. So Red Benton had 
been right — but Red Benton was al- 
ways right. Familiar with the bu- 
reaucratic process, she knew she 
could delay the hearing until 
Monday to complete the weekend 
collegiate circuit of the spectacular, 
but the public showing would be 
killed by the petition. 



Lyn dialed Amal as soon as Kley 
hung up. Nils Larsen answered. 
He was so happy it was her that 
she hated to cut short his greeting 
to get Amal to the phone, but it 
developed that Amal was not in. 
Nils said he had gone to Angeles 
Crest to hunt deer. 

Here was a puzzling devel- 
opment, she thought. By infer- 
erence she had gathered that 
Amal was against the sport of 
hunting and it seemed to her he had 
picked an inappropriate time for 
such activities. She told Nils to 
have Amal call her as soon as he 
got in and then she did what he 
would have done — she called Red 
Benton. 

Red sounded insufferably 
unperturbed by the news. 

“What intrigues me is why Jim 
Osborne is putting on his battle 
dress for a minor skirmish. The 
P.M.A. will pay through the nose 
for this.’’ 

“Perhaps he’s doing it out of 
regard for motherhood.” 

“Not him. Osborne would over- 
charge his grandmother and put a 
lien on her pod. No matter. I think 
I can take him. He’s an over-the- 
hill legal trickster and I know a few 
tricks myself.” 

Red’s arrogance was so ob- 
noxious Lyn might have hoped for 
his failure had not his failure al- 
ready been a probability so strong it 
was almost a certainty. 

Amal called before she went to 
dinner. On the screen he looked 



82 



GALAXY 




tired and seemed almost indifferent 
to the petition. 

“It will be tragic if we can’t get 
the message to the general public, 
but that’s Red’s responsibility. I 
have other things to do.” 

“How was the hunting?” 

“Not too pleasant. I bagged one 
deer with a longbow. The stalking 
was fun but the killing wasn’t 
pleasant.” 

“Then why kill it?” 

“An anthropologist on campus is 
converting the venison to pem- 
mican. It’s an easily carried and nu- 
tritious survival food. I’ll bring you 
a three-day supply Saturday. But 
I will not see you before then.” 

H EYWOOD had acted from 
genuine concern for the safety 
of Los Angeles. On the night of the 
preview, early morning in Kiev, 
Russia, Ailya Eugenia Semonovna 
had completed her epic poem, 
Memories of Mother, and kept her 
appointment with death. Ailya’s 
appointment had been no quiet ren- 
dezvous befitting the end of a poet. 
In fact, Ailya Eugenia Semenovna 
had been the worst thing to hit Kiev 
since Adolph Hitler. 

As was her three-fourths brother, 
Amal, Ailya was enamored of 
speed, a trait cloned into her fore- 
brain from the tissues of a female 
Russian astronaut on display in the 
Kremlin. As was her genetic 
mother, the English poetess, Ailya 
was given to strong drink. To throw 
off her nostalgia for a simpler and 



more primitive “Mother Russia” of 
her poem, she put “finis” to the last 
page and went for a drive, though it 
was long after midnight. 

Ironically a half-empty bottle of 
vodka, found in the wreckage of her 
car, was all that survived the crash 
intact. 

At high speed, Ailya rounded a 
curve on a back-country road in the 
Padrovski District southwest of 
Kiev and slammed into a tank 
truck. The truck -was transporting 
4,000 liters of liquid cyanide to a 
pesticide factory in Darnitsa. Its 
driver was taking the back roads in 
the early morning to avoid traffic. 
Struck broadside, the truck was 
hurled from the road — its seams 
split and the liquid cyanide poured 
into a reservoir serving southwest 
Kiev. Before the wreckage was 
found 76,000 citizens of Kiev had 
drunk water from the reservoir and 
died. 

When the death toll taken by a 
poetess exceeded that of the laser 
and chemical engineers combined, 
geneticists concluded that the death 
wish of the prototypes was no 
longer a private matter. Possessors 
of the Thanatos Syndrome were not 
merely death lovers — regardless of 
occupation they were artisans of 
mass slaughter. No longer would 
the boys in the backroom speak 
lightly of “the Mayfly factor” or 
the “cockeyed helix.” Now they 
would call it what it was — the 
Doomsday Gene. 

Amal had to be stopped. It was 



THE DOOMSDAY GENE

suspected by observers that he was 
being assisted and protected by 
students, a group traditionally 
furtive, clandestine and antisocial. 
The longer Amal lived, the larger 
his organization grew, the more 
dangerous he became. It was felt 
that somehow he would use the 
gatherings at the spectaculars as his 
instrument for mass death or, 
failing that, an earthquake panic. 

So Dr. Heywood decided to 
speed up the local AE 7’s process of 
self-elimination and called his 
mother at U.C.L.A. 



1 YN saw Amal only once over the 
i weekend and then briefly. He 
dropped by to bring her a packet of 
pemmican, leaving the student who 
had driven him below in the car, be- 
cause he was rushing to an ap- 
pointment in the Culver Tower. He 
looked so tired she wanted to chide 
him for overworking but, knowing 
he would do as he had to do 
anyway, she voiced regrets that 
they could not be together Sunday. 
Her remark saddened him. 

“How much easier it would be if 
we were rehearsing for tomorrow’s 
wedding in Dotham. I feel like a 
kangaroo in a tar pit — the higher I 
hope the deeper I sink. Well, one 
more week.’’ 

When he embraced her to kiss her 
goodbye she sensed around him a 
vast weariness, a longing for 
surcease, for cessation of effort, for 
peace and rest. She knew then that 



he truly would have preferred to be 
with her in Dotham. 

On Sunday she went to church 
alone and early to get a front pew 
where she sat and gazed wistfully at 
the altar, particularly after the 
preacher began to speak on the 
value of the Puritan Ethic. Work, 
diligently pursued, he averred, was 
the best method of heightening 
sensation. Slothfulness was leading 
to wilder and wilder spectaculars 
such as Los Angeles — the Last 
Day. He had attended a student 
production and said the show’s only 
socially redeeming feature was a 
tableau at the climax which 
reflected the producer’s apprecia- 
tion of Christian fellowship among 
the aged. 

Lyn halved her usual donation to 
the plate, feeling the preacher was a 
poor drama critic and a spokesman 
for the mothers’ lobby. 

On Monday she found Counselor 
Osborne to be a much more per- 
ceptive critic than the preacher. 
Osborne branded the Leisure 
World tableau “a lascivious pan- 
dering to the sexual arrogance of 
the young, a symbolic fatuity in line 
with the show’s other scientific 
fallacies.’’ 

Osborne proved a better drama 
critic than a petition pleader. To 
the great glee of the press corps. 
Red Benton “took’’ the famed 
counselor by a trick as devious as 
any The Glorious One himself had 
ever pulled in a courtroom.

N EVER had the springtime 
been so wonderful. Never had 
business been so good. Never was 
the World Outlook so bright. And 
never had the girls been so pretty. 

It is true that it was the chilliest 
spring in decades — sharp, bitter, 
and eternally foggy — and that the 
sinuses of Roy Ronsard were in 
open revolt. It is admitted that 
bankruptcies were setting records, 
those of individuals and firms as 
well as those of nations. It is a fact 
that the aliens had landed (though 
their group was not identified) and 
had published their Declaration 
that one-half of mankind was 
hereby obsoleted and the other half 
would be retained as servants. The 
omens and portents were black, but 
the spirits of men were the brightest 
and happiest ever. 

To repeat, never had the girls 
been so pretty! There was no one 
who could take exception to that. 

Roy Ronsard himself faced bank- 
ruptcy and the loss of everything 
that he had built up. But he faced it 
in a most happy frame of mind. A 
Higher Set of Values will do 
wonders toward erasing such 
mundane everyday irritations. 

There is much to be said in favor 
of cold, vicious springtimes. They 
represent weather at its most vital. 
There is something to be said for 
exploding sinuses. They indicate, at 
least, that a man has something in 
his head. And, if a man is going to 
be a bankrupt, then let him be a 
happy bankrupt. 



When the girls are as pretty as all 
that, the rest does not matter. 

Let us make you understand just 
how pretty Eva was! She was a 
golden girl with hair like honey. 
Her eyes were blue — or they were 
green — or they were violet or gold 
and they held a twinkle that melted 
a man. The legs of the creature 
were like Greek poetry and the mo- 
tion of her hips was something that 
went out of the world with the old 
sail ships. Her breastwork had a 
Gothic upsweep — her neck was 
passion incarnate and her shoulders 
were of a glory past describing. In 
her whole person she was a study of 
celestial curvatures. 

Should you never have heard her 
voice, the meaning of music has 
been denied you. Have you not 
enjoyed her laughter? Then your 
life remains unrealized. 

It is possible that exaggeration 
has crept into this account? No. 
That is not possible. All this fits in 
with the cold appraisal of men like 
Sam Pinta, Cyril Colbert, Willy 
Whitecastle, George Goshen, Roy 
Ronsard himself — and that of a 
hundred men who had gazed on her 
in amazement and delight since she 
came to town. All these men are of 
sound judgment in this field. And 
actually she was prettier than they 
admitted. 

Too, Eva Ellery was but one of 
many. There was Jeannie who 
brought a sort of pleasant insanity 
to all who met her. Roberta who 
was a scarlet dream. Helen — high-

GALAXY 




voltage sunshine. Margaret — the 
divine clown. And it was high ad- 
venture just to meet Hildegarde. A 
man could go blind from looking at 
her. 

“I can’t understand how there 
can be so many beautiful young 
women in town this year,” said 
Roy. “It makes the whole world 
worth while. Can you lei me have 
fifty dollars, Willy? I’m going to see 
Eva Ellery. When I first met her I 
thought that she was a halluci- 
nation. She’s real enough, though. 
Do you know her?’’ 

“Yes. A most remarkable young 
woman. She has a small daughter 
named Angela who really stops the 
clock. Roy, I have just twenty 
dollars left in the world and I’ll split 
it with you. As you know, I’m going 
under, too. I don’t know what I’ll 
do after they take my business 
away from me. It’s great to be 
alive, Roy.’’ 

“Wonderful. I hate not having 
money to spend on Eva, but she’s 
never demanding in that. In fact 
she’s lent me money to smooth out 
things pertinent to the termination 
of my business. She’s one of the 
most astute business women I ever 
knew and has been able to persuade 
my creditors to go a little easy on 
me. I won’t get out with my shirt. 
But, as she says, I may get out with 
my skin.” 

T HERE was a beautiful, cold, 
mean fog and one remembered 
that there was a glorious sun (not 



seen for many days now) 
somewhere behind it. The world 
rang with cracked melody and 
everybody was in love with life. 

Everybody except Peggy Ron- 
sard and wives like her who did not 
understand the higher things. Peggy 
had now become like a fog with no 
sun anywhere behind it. Roy 
realized, as he came home to her 
for a moment, that she was very 
drab. 

“Well?” Peggy asked with un- 
dertones in her voice. Her voice did 
not have overtones like that of Eva. 
Only undertones. 

“Well what? My — uh — love?” 
Roy asked. 

“The business— what’s the latest 
on it today? What have you come 
up with?” 

“Oh, the business. I didn’t bother 
to go by today. I guess it’s lost.” 
“You are going to lose it without 
a fight? You used not to be like 
that. Two weeks ago your auditing 
firm said that you had all sorts of 
unrealized assets and that you’d 
come out of this easily.” 

“And two weeks later my 
auditing firm is also taking bank- 
ruptcy. Everybody’s doing it now.” 
“There wasn’t anything wrong 
with that auditing firm till that 
Roberta woman joined it. And 
there wasn’t anything wrong with 
your company till you started to 
listen to that Eva creature.” 

“Is she not beautiful, Peggy?” 
Peggy made a noise Roy under- 
stood as assent, but he had not been 



PARTHEN 



87 




understanding his wife well lately. 

“And there’s another thing,” said 
Peggy dangerously. “You used to 
have a lot of the old goat in you and 
that’s gone. A wife misses things 
like that. And your wolfish friends 
have all changed. Sam Pinta used 
to climb all over me like I was a 
trellis — and I couldn’t sit down 
without Willy Whitecastle being on 
my lap. And Judy Pinta says that 
Sam has changed so much at home 
that life just isn’t worth living any 
more. You all used to be such 
loving men! What’s happened to 
you?” 

“Ah — I believe that our minds 
are now on a higher plane.” 

“You didn’t go for that higher 
plane jazz till that Eva woman 
came along. And that double- 
damned Roberta! But she does 
have two lovely little girls, I’ll 
admit. And that Margaret, she’s 
the one that’s got Cyril Colbert and 
George Goshen where they’re 
pushovers for anything now. She 
does have a beautiful daughter, 
though.” 

“Have you noticed how many 
really beautiful women there are in 
town lately, Peggy?” 

“Roy, I hope those aliens get 
every damned cucumber out of that 
patch! The monsters are bound to 
grab all the pretty women first. I 
hope they’re a bunch of sadist alli- 
gators and do everything that the 
law disallows to those doll babies.” 

“Peggy, I believe that the aliens 
(and we are told that they are al- 



ready among us) will be a little 
more sophisticated than popular 
ideas anticipate.” 

“I hope they’re a bunch of Jack 
the Rippers. I believe I could go for 
Jack today. He’d certainly be a 
healthy contrast to what presently 
obtains.” 

P )EGGY had put her tongue on 
the crux. For the beautiful 
young women, who seemed to be 
abundant in town that springtime, 
had an odd effect on the men who 
came under their influence. The 
goats among the men had become 
lambs and the wolves had turned 
into puppies. 

Jeannie was of such a striking ap- 
pearance as to make a man almost 
cry out. But the turmoil that she 
raised in her gentlemen friends was 
of a cold sort, for all that the white 
flames seemed to leap up. She was 
Artemis herself and the men 
worshiped her on the higher plane. 
She was wonderful to look at and to 
talk to. But who would be so 
boorish as to touch? 

The effect of Eva was similar 
and of Roberta and of Helen (who 
had three little daughters as like her 
as three golden apples) and of Mar- 
garet and of Hildegarde. How 
could a man not ascend to the 
higher plane when such wonderful 
and awesome creatures as these 
abounded? 

But the damage was done when 
the men carried this higher plane 
business home to their compara- 



88 



GALAXY 




tively colorless wives. The men 
were no longer the ever-loving hus- 
bands that they should have been. 
The most intimate relations ceased 
to take place. If continued long this 
could have an effect on the statis- 
tics. 

B UT daily affairs sometimes 
crept into the conversations of 
even those men who had ascended 
to the higher plane. 

“I was wondering,” Roy asked 
George Goshen, ‘‘when our busi- 
nesses are all gone — who do they go 
to?” 

“Many of us have wondered 
that,” George told him. “They all 
seem to devolve upon anonymous 
recipients or upon corporations 
without apparent personnel. But 
somebody is gathering in the com- 
panies. One theory is that the aliens 
are doing it.” 

“The aliens are among us, the au- 
thorities say, but nobody has seen 
them. They publish their program 
and their progress through interme- 
diaries who honestly do not know 
the original effectors. The aliens 
still say that they will make 
obsolete one-half of mankind and 
make servants of the other half.” 
“Jeannie says — did you ever see 
her pretty little daughters? — that 
we see the aliens every day and do 
not recognize them for what they 
are. She says that likely the in- 
vasion of the aliens will have ob- 
tained its objective before we 
realize what that is. What’s the 



news from the rest of the country 
and the world?” 

“The same. All business is going 
to pot and everybody is happy. On 
paper, things were never more 
healthy. There’s a lot of new 
backing from somewhere and all 
the businesses thrive as soon as they 
have shuffled off their old owners. 
The new owners — and nobody can 
find out who or what they are — 
must be happy with the way things 
are going. Still, I do not believe that 
anybody could be happier or more 
contented than I am. Can you let 
me have fifty cents, George? I just 
remembered that I haven’t eaten 
today. Peggy has gone to work for 
what used to be my company, but 
she’s a little slow to give me proper 
spending money. Come to think of 
it, Peggy has been acting peculiar 
lately.” 

“I have only forty cents left in the 
world, Roy. Take the quarter. My 
wife has gone to work also, but I 
guess there will never be any work , 
for us. Did you think we’d ever live 
to see the no males wanted signs 
on every hiring establishment in the 
country? Oh, well — if you’re happy 
nothing else matters.” 

“George, there’s a humorous 
note that creeps into much of the 
world news lately. It seems that 
ours is not the only city with an 
unusual number of pretty young 
ladies this season. They’ve been 
reported in Teheran and Lvov, in 
Madras and Lima and Boston. 
Everywhere.”

“No! Pretty girls in Boston? 
You’re kidding. This has certainly 
been an up-side down year when 
things like that can happen. But did 
you ever see a more beautiful sum- 
mertime, Roy?” 

“On my life I never did.” 

The summer had been murky and 
the sun had not been seen for many 
months. But it was a beautiful 
murk. And when one is attuned to 
inner beauty the outer aspect of 
things does not matter. The main 
thing was that everyone was happy. 

Oh, there were small misunder- 
standings. There was a wife — this 
was reported as happening in Cin- 
cinnati, but it may have happened 



in other places also — who one 
evening reached out and touched 
her husband’s hand in a form of 
outmoded affection. Naturally the 
man withdrew his hand rudely, for 
it was clear that the wife had not yet 
ascended to his higher plane. In the 
morning he went away and did not 
return. 

Many men were drifting away 
from their homes in those days. 
Most men, actually. However that 
old' cohabitational arrangement 
had grown into being, it no longer 
had anything to recommend it. 
When one has consorted with the 
light itself, what can he find in a 
tallow candle?

Most of the men became de- 
stitute wanderers and loafers. They 
were happy with their inner illumi- 
nation. Every morning the dead 
ones would be shoveled up by the 
women on the disposal trucks and 
carted away. And every one of 
those men died happy. That’s what 
made it so nice. To anyone who had 
entered higher understanding death 
was only an interlude. 

I T WAS a beautiful autumn day. 

Roy Ronsard and Sam Pinta 
had just completed their fruitless 
rounds of what used to be called 
garbage cans but now had more 
elegant names. They were still 
hungry, but happily so for it was 
truly a beautiful autumn. 

The snow had come early, it is 
true, and great numbers of men had 
perished from it. But if one had a 
happy life, it was not a requisite for 
it to be a long life. Men lived little 
in the world now, dwelling mostly 
in thought. But sometimes they still 
talked to each other. 

“It says here — ” Roy Ronsard 
began to read a piece of old news- 
paper that had been used for wrap- 
ping bones — “that Professor 
Eimer, just before he died of mal- 
nutrition, gave as his opinion that 
the aliens among us cannot stand 
sunlight. He believed it was for this 
reason that they altered our at- 
mosphere and made ours a gloomy 
world. Do you believe that, Sam?” 
“Hardly. How could anybody 
call ours a gloomy world? 1 believe 



that we are well rid of that damned 
sun.” 

“And it says that he believed that 
one of the weapons of the aliens was 
their intruding into men a general 
feeling of euphor — the rest of the 
paper is torn off.” 

“Roy, 1 saw Margaret today. 
From a distance, of course. 
Naturally I could not approach 
such an incandescent creature in 
my present condition of poverty. 
But Roy, do you realize how much 
we owe to those pretty girls? I really 
believe that we would have known 
nothing of the higher plane or the 
inner light if it had not been for 
them. How could they have been so 
pretty?” 

“Sam, there is one thing about 
them that always puzzled me.” 
“Everything about them puzzled 
me. What do you mean?” 

“All of them have daughters, 
Sam. And none of them have hus- 
bands. Why did none of them have 
husbands? Or sons?” 

“Never thought of it. It’s been a 
glorious year, Roy. My only regret 
is that I will not live to see the 
winter that will surely be the climax 
to this radiant autumn. We have 
had so much — we cannot expect to 
have everything. Do you not just 
love deep snow over you?” 

“It’s like the blanket of heaven, 
Sam. When the last of us is gone — 
and it won’t be too long now — do 
you think the girls will remember 
how much light they brought into 
our lives?” ★

C OMMODORE GRIMES sat 
at his desk, looking down at 
the transcript of a Carlottigram 
from Port Listowel. Lord Of The 
Isles, one of the lightjammers on 
the run between the. Rim Worlds 
and the Llanithi Consortium, was 
overdue. She, using her own 
Carlotti equipment, had beamed a 
final message to Port Forlorn 
before breaking the light barrier. 
Once the speed of light had been 
exceeded she was in a weird, private 
universe of her own — stranger even 
than the private universes of ships 
running under the space-time” 
twisting Mannschenn Drive — and 
unable to communicate with any 
planetary base or any other ship. 
Toward the end of her voyage she 
had made her routine reduction of 
speed to a sublight velocity and had 
started to send her ETA to the 
Carlotti Station on Llanith. She 
had gotten as far as giving her name 
and then, according to the Llanithi 
Carlotti operator on watch, had 
experienced what seemed to be in- 
terference on the band in use. 
Nothing more had been heard from 
her. And now she was all of ten 
days overdue. 

The communicator buzzed 
sharply. 

Grimes pressed the button that 
would admit the incoming call. The 
screen lit up and on it appeared the 
fleshy, ruddy face of Admiral 
Kravitz. 



“Ah, Grimes.” 

The commodore repressed the 
temptation to counter with, And 
whom the hell else did you expect? 
Legally speaking the admiral was 
not his superior officer except when 
Grimes was called back to active 
duty with the Rim Worlds Navy, 
but there would be no sense in an- 
tagonizing the man. 

“Sir?” Grimes replied curtly. 

“This Lord Of The Isles business. 
Grimes?” 

“You have a transcript of the 
signal from Port Listowel, sir? 

“Of course. We do have an in- 
telligence branch, you know. What 
do you make of it?” 

“I don’t like it. Especially 
coming right after the vanishing of 
Sea Witch under very similar 
circumstances.” 

“What are you doing about it, 
Grimes?” 

“I could ask you the same 
question, sir.” 

“We cleaned up the energy-eaters 
for you, Grimes, and we made a 
clean sweep. Rim Culverin has been 
maintaining a patrol ever since the 
conclusion of Operation Rimhunt 
and has reported no further in- 
vasion of our territorial space by 
those entities.” The admiral 
paused, then went on: “I’m not 
altogether happy about those light- 
jammers of yours, Grimes. As you 
know, we’re having some built for 
the Navy, but I’m beginning to feel 
like trying to get the program can- 
celed. They aren’t safe. Sailing

ships, indeed, in this day and age?” 
“They’re the only ships we have 
capable of trading with the Llanithi 
Consortium.” 

“At the moment, Grimes, at the 
moment. But our boffins are 
working on some other, simpler 
way of achieving a reversal of 
atomic charges.” 

“With what success, sir?” asked 
Grimes innocently. 

Kravitz flushed. “None so far. 
But give them time, give them time. 
Meanwhile — ” 

“Sir?” 

“Meanwhile, Grimes, I am 
recalling you to active duty. As 
long as the so-called ships of the 
line are still on our drawing boards 
we have to maintain an interest in 
sailing vessels. Furthermore, I have 
learned from your employers — 
from Rim Runners — that all 
further sailings of the lightjammers 
have been suspended until such 
time as the mystery of the disap- 
pearance of Lord Of The Isles and 
Sea Witch has been cleared up. 
They are agreeable to the requisi- 
tioning and commissioning of 
Pamir as an auxiliary cruiser. You 
will sail in her.” 

Grimes grinned. “Thank you, sir. 
But I have to tell you that I’m- not 
qualified in sail.” 

“ Pamir’s people are — and they 
all, like yourself, hold reserve com- 
missions. Listowel’s a full com- 
mander, isn’t he? You’ll be in 
overall charge of the ship and the 
expedition, but he can be your 



sailing master. We’ll be putting 
aboard regular Navy personnel — 
gunnery specialists and the like. 
Satisfied?” 

“Gunnery specialists?” 

“You never know when weapons 
are going to come in handy, 
Grimes. It’s better to have them 
than to be without them.” 

Grimes had to agree. He knew as 
well as anybody that the universe 
was not peaceful and that Man was 
not its only breaker of peace. 

N OT at all reluctantly Grimes 
handed over his astronautical 
superintendent’s duties to Captain 
Barsac, one of Rim Runners’ senior 
masters. But it was with a certain 
degree of reluctance that he left his 
comfortable home in Port Forlorn 
for Port Erikson, the lightjammers’ 
terminal. Sonya refused to accom- 
pany her husband. She detested cold 
weather. Port Forlorn’s climate 
was barely tolerable. Only 
Esquimaux, polar bears or pen- 
guins — assuming that the immi- 
gration or importation of these 
from Earth could be arranged — 
would feel at home at Coldharbor 
Bay in Lorn’s Antarctica. 

Pamir was alongside at Port 
Erikson. The cargo she had brought 
from Llanith had been discharged 
but she had not commenced to load 
for the return voyage. As yet the 
advance party from the Admiralty 
Yards was still to arrive, although 
accommodations — looking like

black, partially inflated balloons 
grounded in the snow — had been set 
up for them. 

Grimes, accompanied by Captain 
Rowse, the Port Erikson harbor- 
master, went aboard Pamir. He 
was received by Ralph Listowel, the 
lightjammer’s master. 

“Glad to have you aboard, sir,” 
said Listowel. 

“Glad to be aboard. Com- 
mander.” 

Listowel scowled. “That’s right, 
sir. Rub it in. I suppose you’ll be 
taking over my quarters.” 

Grimes grinned. “No. You’re to 
be my sailing master — and, as far 
as I’m concerned, this is still your 
ship and you’re still the master of 
her. You’ve quite palatial passenger 
accommodations. That’ll do me.” 

Listowel’s scowl faded from his 
lean, dark face. “Thank you, sir. 
But what is going on?” 

“Your ship has been requisi- 
tioned — and you and your officers 
have been called up for active duty 
in the Rim Worlds Navy.” 

“I know that. But what is going 
on?” 

“I was hoping that you’d be able 
to tell me.” 

Listowel waved his visitors to 
seats, took a chair himself. He said, 
“Let’s face it, Commodore. To date 
the lightjammers have been lucky, 
fantastically lucky. Even in Flying 
Cloud, where we had to make up 
the rules as we went along, we all 
came through in one piece. But 
sooner or later luck runs out.” 



“You think that’s what happened 
to Sea Witch and Lord Of The 
Isles?” 

“There are so many things that 
could happen. When we’re running 
under sail, building up to a velocity 
just short of that light, we could hit 
something — ” 

“And the flare of the explosion 
would be seen from Llanith.” 

“All right, all right. Something 
could go wrong with the magnetic 
suspension of the sphere of 
antiiron — ” 

“And with matter and anti-mat- 
ter canceling each other out the 
burst of released energy would be 
even more spectacular.” 

“Yes, Commodore. But what if it 
happened at trans-light speed? We 
know very little of conditions out- 
side the ship at that velocity. Would 
the explosion be witnessed in this 
universe — or in the next universe 
but three?” 

“Mphm. You have something 
there, Listowel. Even so, we’ve two 
ships missing, one after the other. 
There’s an old saying: Once is hap- 
penstance. Twice is coincidence. 
Three times is enemy action.” 

“There hasn’t been a third time,” 
said Listowel. 

“Yet,” pointed out Grimes. “But 
there’s still the apparent jamming 
of Lord Of The Isles' last call to be 
considered.” 



B ACK in Rowse’s office Grimes 
asked for the manifests of the 



96 



GALAXY 




cargoes carried by the two missing 
ships. It was possible that there had 
been some item of freight which, at 
trans-light speeds and with the 
reversal of atomic charges, had be- 
come chemically or physically un- 
stable with fatal consequences. This 
was an idea worth considering. But 
no radioactives had been listed. No 
industrial chemicals, dangerous or 
otherwise, had been listed. Mainly 
the freight carried in each ship had 
consisted of luxury goods — 
preserved foodstuffs, liquor, fine 
textiles and the like. A few ship- 
ments of machine tools and some 
drugs had also been part of the 
cargoes. 

One drug in particular — Anti- 
geriatridine — caught Grimes’ at- 
tention. The substance was not 
manufactured on any of the Rim 
Worlds. It came from Marina, a 
planet in the Pleiades Sector. It was 
an extract from the glands of an in- 
digenous sea slug and could not be 
synthesized. It was fantastically 
expensive and, on most worlds, was 
controlled by the state, rationed out 
only to deserving citizens. It was 
Marina’s main source of income, 
exported to any planet that could 
afford to pay for it. In recent years 
the Llanithi Consortium had been 
placed on Marina’s list of cus- 
tomers. Transhipment for Llanith 
was made from Lorn. 

Grimes’ memory carried him 
back to the long ago days when he 
had been a newly commissioned 
ensign in the Federation Survey 



Service. He had played a part in 
bringing the pirates who had cap- 
tured the merchant vessel Epsilon 
Sextans to book. Epsilon Sextans 
had been carrying Antigeriatridine, 
which had made her a worthwhile 
prey. 

Perhaps Admiral Kravitz’ insis- 
tence that Pamir be armed made 
sense. 

But piracy? 

It was not the continued existence 
of the crime itself that Grimes 
found hard to comprehend, but 
rather the actual mechanics of it. 
Piracy was not unknown along the 
spaceways, but both predators and 
victims had always been conven- 
tional starships, with inertial drive 
and Mannschenn Drive and 
auxiliary rocket power for use in 
emergencies. Under inertial drive 
only, maintaining a comfortable 1G 
acceleration, a ship could build up 
almost to the speed of light if she 
took long enough about it. But, as 
soon as possible, she usually ran 
under Mannschenn Drive which, in 
effect, gave her FTL velocity. In 
these conditions she was un- 
touchable unless the vessel at- 
tacking her succeeded in synchro- 
nizing her own rate of temporal 
precession. The captains of 
warships — and of such vessels as 
have from time to time sailed on the 
plundering account — were reason- 
ably competent in the practice of 
this art. 

But it would be impossible for a 
ship proceeding under inertial drive 



ON THE ACCOUNT 



97 




only to match velocities with a 
lightjammer under sail. And a ship 
running under Mannschenn Drive 
would have to return to the normal 
space-time continuum before her 
weapons could be brought to bear 
on a lightjammer — and, once again, 
the matching of velocities would be 
impossible. 

Hijacking was a form of piracy, 
of course. 

Grimes turned from the missing 
ships’ cargo manifests to their 
passenger lists. The names meant 
nothing to him, neither those of 
Rim Worlds citizens nor of 
Llanithans. No doubt the police 
could help him in this respect. 
Perhaps one or more of those 
passengers had a criminal record. 
But the hypothesis made little ap- 
peal to him. He just could not 
imagine the officers of either of the 
vessels submitting meekly — and he 
could not imagine any passenger 
being able to handle a lightjammer. 
Sail spacemanship was an art 
rather than a science and the only 
practioners of the art — Grimes told 
himself — consisted of the handful 
of Rim Runners’ personnel trained 
and qualified for lightjammers. 

He filled and lit his pipe, looked 
down at the manifests and 
passenger lists on the desk. He had 
a hunch that the manifests meant 
more than the passenger lists — no 
more than a hunch, but his hunches 
were often right. Any ship — even a 
pirate ship — anywhere in space 
between Lorn and Llanith and in 



position to receive the beamed 
Carlotti transmissions from one 
planet to the other, would be able to 
read the routine signals sent im- 
mediately after the lift-off of one of 
the lightjammers. Date and time of 
departure — passengers carried — a 
listing of freight aboard. Nothing 
was encoded. There had never been 
any need for secrecy until now. 

Only the actual mechanics of at- 
tack, seizure and boarding puzzled 
him. 

H E CALLED Sonya, told her 
that she had better come to 
Port Erikson. “You’re the in- 
telligence officer in this family,” he 
said. “This job calls for in- 
telligence.” Reluctantly she agreed 
to join him. 

The following morning he stood 
in the Port Erikson control tower, 
looking out through the wide win- 
dows at the bleak landscape. Pamir 
was alongside at her wharf, a great, 
dull-gleaming torpedo shape on the 
dark water. The sleekness of her 
lines was broken only by the pods 
that housed her airscrews and their 
engines. Out on Coldharbor Bay a 
small tug, Bustler, was chuffing 
busily back and forth, functioning 
as an icebreaker, keeping the har- 
bor clear of any accumulation of 
ice heavy enough to impede surface 
maneuvers. Grimes had decided 
that Pamir must keep to her 
original schedule, which meant that 
her conversion to an auxiliary 
cruiser would be a skimpy one. 



98 



GALAXY 




There would be time for the in- 
stallation of an extra generator and 
the fitting of two batteries of laser 
cannon, but no more. 

A familiar voice issued from the 
traffic controller’s transceiver. 
“Pinnace Firefly to Port Erikson. 
Do you read me? Over.’’ 

“Loud and clear, Firefly. Pass 
your message. Over.” 

Grimes went to stand by the traf- 
fic control officer. He heard Sonya 
say, “My ETA Port Erikson oh- 
nine-four-five hours, your time. 
Over.” 

So neither she — nor Admiral 
Kravitz — had wasted any time. 
And Sonya was doing her own 
piloting, which was typical of her. 

“I have her on the screen, sir,” 
announced the radar operator. 

Grimes went to the window over- 
looking' the Nullarbor Plain, al- 
most featureless under the blanket 
of snow. It was one of the rare clear 
days, and on the horizon stood the 
distant, jagged battlements of the 
Great Barrens. And was that a tiny, 
glittering speck in the pale sky? 
Yes. It expanded rapidly and even 
in the control tower, through the 
thick glass of the windows, the irri- 
tated snarl of an inertial drive unit 
operating at maximum capacity 
was distinctly audible. 

“That’s her,” said Captain 
Rowse. 

“That’s her,” agreed Grimes. He 
shrugged into his heavy cloak, put 
on his cap and went down to the 
airstrip to meet Sonya. 



<<*T*HE trouble with you, 
A John,” she said, “is that 
you’ve read too much of the wrong 
kind of history. Wooden ships and 
iron men and all that sort of thing. 
Pieces of eight. Broadsides of car- 
ronades. The Jolly Roger. Oh, 
there have been space pirates, I 
admit. But I still get my share of 
the bumf issued by the Federation 
Survey Service’s intelligence 
branch — and I can tell you that 
today there just aren’t any pirates. 
Not that sort of pirate, anyway. 
There’s still the occasional 
hijacking.” 

Grimes’ prominent ears flushed. 
He indicated with his hand the 
passenger lists. He said, “I’ve asked 
the Port Forlorn chief of police if 
any of these people have criminal 
records. He assures me that none of 
them have and that everybody 
aboard Lord Of The Isles and Sea 
Witch was a little, innocent woolly 
lamb — ” 

“He’d know, wouldn’t he?” She 
herself was flushed, her fine fea- 
tures literally glowing under the 
glossy auburn hair. “And you have 
all these bright ideas and drag me 
out here, where all the brass 
monkeys are singing falsetto, to 
join you in this comfortless shack to 
help you think.” 

“Not comfortless,” said Grimes. 
The quarters that he had been given 
were commodious and comfortable 
enough, although lacking in 
character, accommodation, mar- 
ried COUPLE, FOR THE USE OF.

“Well, what do you intend doing? 
Put me in the picture.” 

“ Pamir will sail on time, having 
loaded the cargo that’s been booked 
for her. That will include a ship- 
ment of Antigeriatridine. The usual 
routine signals will be made once 
she has lifted off. And then we wait 
to see what happens next.” 

“We?” 

“I suppose you’ll be coming 
along.” 

“I might as well get a free trip to 
Llanith out of it.” 

“All right. You. Me. Ralph Lis- 
towel and his officers. The gunnery 
officer from the Navy who’ll be 
looking after the laser batteries. 
The two dozen or so marines who’ll 
be traveling as passengers.” 
“Anybody would think that you 
were contemplating embarking on 
a career of piracy yourself.” 

Grimes laughed. “Why not? 
After all, one of my ancestors sailed 
on the account.” 

“And what happened to him?” 
“He was eventually hanged from 
his own yardarm.” 

She joined him in his laughter. 
“Then you’d better be careful. 
After all, the lightjammers are the 
only ships that run to masts and 
yards!” 

II 

AMIR was ready for space. 

The extra generator had been 
installed, as had been the batteries 



of laser cannon. Stores for the 
voyage and the cargo had been 
loaded. The passengers were em- 
barked. Grimes and Sonya, 
together with Major Trent, the 
marine officer, and Lieutenant 
Fowler, the gunnery officer, sat 
with Listowel and his wife, Sandra, 
in the master’s day cabin. 

Listowel sipped his coffee rather 
glumly. He asked Grimes stiffly, 
“Have I your permission to cast 
off, sir, at the arranged time?” 

“Of course, Listowel. You’re the 
master still. The rest of us are just 
along for the ride.” 

“It’s a ride I’m looking forward 
to,” put in Fowler enthusiastically. 
He was a young giant with short- 
cropped yellow hair, the perpetual 
schoolboy so common in all the 
armed services. “It’ll give me some 
time in sail and I’ll be all set for our 
own ships of the line when they 
come out.” 

“It’s not a free ride we’re here 
for,” commented the major sourly. 

“More coffee anybody?” asked 
Sandra cheerfully. 

“No thanks,” replied Listowel, 
looking at his watch. “It’s time we 
got the show on the road.” 

“Can I come up to control, sir?” 
asked Fowler. 

“Of course, Lieutenant. You’re 
welcome on the bridge. And so are 
you, major.” 

Grimes and Sonya went along 
with the others. They had witnessed 
Pamir’s departure from the control 
position before, but it was so unlike 




100 



GALAXY 




the liftoff of a conventional space- 
ship as to remain fascinating. This 
time there was no need to use the 
tug, no need for the transverse 
thrust of the airscrews. The wind, 
what little there was of it, was 
northerly, blowing the ship bodily 
off from the wharf, the brash ice 
piling up along her lee side but not 
impeding her. When she was well 
out into the bay water, ballast was 
dumped and — the sphere of anti- 
matter giving her positive 
buoyancy — she went up like a 
balloon or a rocket — silently. 
Within seconds she was driving 
through the low cloud ceiling and 
then had broken through into the 
clear upper air. Fast she rose — and 
faster — into blackness, while below 
her Lorn became an opalescent 
globe hanging in nothingness. 

The directional gyroscopes 
rumbled and whined, rumbled 
again and then lapsed into silence. 
She was steadied on course now, 
with Lorn to one side and the Lorn 
sun astern. The tiny cluster of 
stars — the anti-matter suns around 
which revolved the planets of the 
Llanithi Consortium — was directly 
ahead. 

The control room guests crowded 
to the side ports of the bridge, 
looking aft to watch as Listowel 
made sail. The stubs of the tele- 
scopic masts extended themselves 
rapidly, sprouting yards as they 
elongated. The yards and the great 
sails, spreading to catch the star 
wind, the royals, the topgallants, 



the upper topsails and the lower 
topsails, the main courses. The 
polarized glass of the viewports 
dimmed the glare of the sun and 
black against it stood the driving 
surfaces, filling to the photon gale. 
The inertialess ship was already 
scudding before it and the Doppler 
Log was clicking and flashing like a 
clock gone mad. 

“Roll and go,” murmured 
Listowel. 

“Wonderful!” breathed Fowler. 

Major Trent only grunted, then 
said, “I’d better get down to see to 
my men.” 

Fowler said, “And I’d better 
check my cannon.” 

“We’ll not be needing them yet,” 
Grimes told him. 



T 'HE ship drove on, steadily ac- 
celerating. 

It was like the first voyage that 
Grimes and Sonya had made in 
Pamir — and yet, in some ways, un- 
like. The atmosphere on board was 
different, mainly because there 
were no civilian passengers. Major 
Trent and his marines were 
passengers of a sort, of course — 
there was little that they could do 
about the ship until such time as 
their professional services would be 
required. But Trent maintained his 
own standards of discipline and 
there was altogether too much heel- 
clicking and saluting. And Lis- 
towel’s officers were all too con- 
scious of their temporary standing

as commissioned personnel of the 
Rim Worlds Navy, serving aboard 
an auxiliary cruiser of that same 
service. Their captain didn’t like it. 

He complained to Grimes over a 
quiet drink in the commodore’s 
quarters: “Damn it all, sir, I’m just 
a shipmaster and my people are my 
mates and engineers and all the rest 
of it. But now I have Mr. bloody 
Willoughby putting on airs and 
graces and expecting to be ad- 
dressed as Lieutenant Commander 
every time anybody talks to him.” 

Grimes chuckled. “It doesn’t 
matter. He can call himself what he 
likes — he’s still a very good chief 
officer.” 

“Even so — ” Then Listowel 
managed a wry chuckle of his own. 
“All right. I’ll let him and the 
others have their fun. But it still re- 
minds me of small boys playing at 
pirates.” 

“Talking of pirates — ” Grimes 
pulled a key from his pocket and 
unlocked a drawer of the desk that 
was part of the cabin’s furniture. “I 
asked you in for a talk as well as a 
drink. You remember that coded 
Carlottigram that came through for 
me on the teletype this morning?” 
He took a sheet of paper out of the 
drawer. 

“This contains the decode, top 
SECRET— YOUR EYES ONLY. To Be 
Destroyed By Fire Before 
Reading — and all the rest of it. 
When it comes to playing childish 
games the Admiralty is at least as 
bad as anybody else. And this 



message concerns us all in this 
vessel. 

“Navy has an intelligence 
service, you know. According to 
Sonya it’s not a patch on the in- 
telligence branch of the Federation 
Survey Service, but its officers do 
flap their ears and twitch their little 
pink noses now and again. 
Unluckily Admiral Kravitz didn’t 
get his paws on their reports con- 
cerning the Duchy of Waldegren 
until after we’d sailed.” 

“Waldegren?” 

“Yes. It seems that our people 
managed to plant some monitor 
buoys in the territorial space of the 
Duchy. I’ve heard those gadgets 
described as miracles of miniaturi- 
zation. See all, hear all, and punch 
it all back to Port Forlorn on tight- 
beam Carlotti in one coded parcel 
before the automatic self-destruc- 
tion. And that, of course, occurs 
when anything approaches within 
ten kilometers. 

“Well, there’s been something 
going on around Darnstadt — the 
fortress planet, so-called. There’s a 
photograph of a lightjammer under 
sail. There are monitored signals — 
both Carlotti and NST.” He tap- 
ped the sheet of paper. “Kravitz 
sent me translations of some of the 
messages. ‘Clear of atmosphere, 
making sail.’ ‘Arrange berthage for 
prize.’ The sort of things you send 
just after departure and just prior to 
arrival.” 

“I don’t take any prizes, 
Commodore.” 



102 



GALAXY 




“You might yet.” Grimes looked 
at his watch. “Time we went to see 
Mr. Fowler get a prize for good 
shooting.” 

“Didn’t you specialize in gunnery 
yourself, sir, when you were in the 
Survey Service?” 

“At one time, yes. But I never 
had a practice shoot at point eight 
the speed of light. This should be 
interesting.” 

“Surely no more so than any 
other practice shoot, Commodore. 
As far as the target rocket and the 
ship are concerned, there’ll be no 
great relative velocities. The target 
will just run parallel to us once it’s 
been launched. If it took evasive 
action it would drop astern too fast 
for Fowler to get a shot at it. We’re 
still accelerating, you know.” 
“Mphm?” Grimes locked away 
the message. “Let’s go to watch the 
fireworks.” 

T HE watchkeeper — Denby, the 
second officer — and all off- 
duty officers were in the control 
room. Sonya was there, too, as was 
Sandra. Major Trent was there, ac- 
companied by his sergeant. 
Wallasey, the third officer, was 
assisting Lieutenant Fowler. The 
gunnery officer sat at his fire con- 
trol console. Young Wallasey was 
at the smaller set of controls, part 
of the ship’s normal equipment, 
from which signal and sounding 
rockets were handled. He was 
managing to look at least as im- 
portant as Fowler. 



“Let battle commence!” whis- 
pered Grimes to Sonya. 

Fowler overheard this and 
scowled. But he said nothing. Com- 
modores, even commodores on the 
Reserve List, were entitled to their 
pleasantries at the expense of mere 
lieutenants. 

“Targets in readiness, Mr. 
Fowler,” reported Wallasey. 

“Thank you, Mr. Wallasey,” re- 
plied Fowler stiffly. Then, to 
Grimes: “Permission to commence 
practice shoot, sir?” 

“This is Captain Listowel’s ship, 
Mr. Fowler,” said Grimes. 

The young man flushed and 
repeated his question to Listowel. 

“Carry on, Mr. Fowler.” 

“Fire one,” he ordered. 

“Fire one,” repeated Wallasey. 

Grimes, looking aft with the 
others, saw the gout of blue flame, 
intensely bright against the black 
backdrop with its sparse scattering 
of stars, as the missile was ejected 
from its launching tube. It fell away 
from the ship on a slightly divergent 
course, pulling ahead, but slowly, at 
first. 

“Open the range, Mr. Wallasey,” 
ordered Fowler. 

“Range opening. One kilometer. 
Two. Four. Ten — ” 

The rocket now was only a bright 
spark against the darkness. 

Fowler worked at his console. 
Abaft the control room but forward 
of the masts and sails the quadruple 
rods of the starboard laser battery 
turned and wavered like the hunting 



ON THE ACCOUNT 



103 




antennae of some huge insect. 
“Fire — ” muttered Fowler to 

himself. A faint glow showed at the 
tips of the rods, nothing more. Here 
there was no air, with its floating 
dust motes, to be heated to in- 
candescence. Out to starboard the 
bright spark persisted, neither ex- 
tinguished nor flaring into sudden 
explosion. 

Fowler muttered something 
about the calibration of his sights, 
then ordered, “Close the range.’’ 
“Range closing, Mr. Fowler. 
Ten. Nine. Eight — damn!” 

“What’s wrong?” 

“Burnout.” The bright spark had 
vanished now. 

“All right. Fire two.” 

“Fire two.” 

The second missile was thrown 
from its tube. 

“Range, Mr. Wallasey?” 

“One kilometer. Opening.” 

“Hold at one kilometer.” Then, 
to himself: “It’s right in the sights. I 
can’t miss — ” 

“But you’re doing just that,” re- 
marked Grimes. 

“But I can’t be!” Fowler sounded 
desperate. “With a single cannon, 
perhaps. But not with a battery of 
four. And the sights can’t be out.” 
Grimes grunted thoughtfully. 
Then: “Tell me, Mr. Fowler, has 
anybody ever tried to use laser in 
these conditions before?” 

“From a lightjammer, you mean, 
sir? From a ship traveling at almost 
the speed of light?” 

“Yes.” 



“You know that this is the First 
time, sir.” 

“And it’s been an interesting ex- 
periment, hasn’t it? Oh, I could be 
wrong, but I have a sort of vision of 
photons being dispersed like water 
from the spray nozzle of a hose. 
Perhaps if the ship were not ac- 
celerating the tight, coherent beam 
would be maintained. Is there a 
physicist in the house?” 

“You know there’s not,” said 
Sonya sharply. 

“Unfortunate, but true. So in 
these conditions our laser is about 
as effective as a searchlight and 
we’ve nobody to tell us what to do 
about it.” 

Fowler was slumped in his seat, a 
picture of dejection. He was a gun- 
nery officer whose weapons were as 
lethal as toy pistols. “Cheer up,” 
Grimes told him. “I’ve a job for 
you.” 

“But what is there for me to do, 
sir? As you’ve pointed out already, 
I’m not a physicist.” 

“But you are a weapons spe- 
cialist.” Grimes turned to 
Wallasey. “How many rockets 
have you left?” 

“Six, sir.” 

“Then I suggest that you and Mr. 
Fowler, assisted by the engineering 
staff, convert them into weapons.” 
“What about warheads?” 

Grimes sighed heavily. “You’d 
never have made a living as a can- 
noneer in the early days of artillery, 
Mr. Fowler. Those old boys used to 
cast their own cannon and mix their 



104 



GALAXY 




own powder — and they didn’t have 
the ingredients that we have aboard 
this ship. Ammonium nitrate, for 
example — one of the chemical ferti- 
lizers we use in the hydroponic 
tanks. We should be able to cook 
up something packing far more of a 
wallop than gunpowder.” 

“You’re convinced that we shall 
need weapons, John?” put in 
Sonya. 

“I’m not convinced of anything. 
But somebody once said — 
Cromwell, wasn’t it? — ‘Trust in 
God, and keep your powder dry.’ 
Furthermore, my dear, this vessel is 
rated as an auxiliary cruiser, a unit 
of the Rim Worlds Navy. Our lords 
and masters of the Admiralty have, 
in their wisdom, equipped her with 
weaponry. We have discovered that 
this weaponry is useless. So — we 
improvise.” 

“I’m surprised,” she said, “that 
you don’t follow in the footsteps of 
your piratical ancestor and fit 
Pamir out with a couple of 
broadsides of muzzle-loading 
cannon.” 

A slow smile spread over Grimes’ 
rugges features. “Why not?” he 
murmured happily. “Why not?” 

ALL deep space ships carry a 
biochemist. In large passen- 
ger vessels and warships he is a de- 
partmental head, but usually he is 
one of the officers who has been put 
through a crash course and looks 
after the life-support systems in ad- 



dition to his other duties. Pamir’s 
biochemist was Sandra Listowel, 
who was also purser and catering 
officer. Even a fulltime, fully 
qualified biochemist is not an in- 
dustrial chemist. Sandra most cer- 
tainly was not. Nonetheless, she 
succeeded— losing her eyebrows 
and a little more than half of her 
blond hair in the process — in 
brewing up a batch of what Grimes 
referred to as sort-of-kind-of 
amatol. After all, cooking oil is not 
toluene. Lieutenant Fowler, given 
the freedom of the engineer’s work- 
shop, was told to produce a half- 
dozen impact fuses. He was a good 
worker and not unintelligent but 
sadly lacking, Grimes concluded, in 
initiative. He was a good gunnery 
officer only when he had all the 
resources of a naval arsenal behind 
him. 

Grimes, however, loved im- 
provising. Many years ago, when he 
had been Federation Survey 
Service lieutenant, commanding 
the courier Adder, he had made 
some missiles, using large plastic 
bottles as the casings and black 
powder as the propellant. After a 
browse through the chemical ferti- 
lizers in the “farm’s” storerooms he 
decided that he had the necessary 
ingredients for more black powder. 
He wanted something relatively 
slow-burning for the weapons he 
had in mind. 

He had seen Pamir’s manifest of 
cargo on the completion of loading. 
One item was a consignment of

metal piping with a bore of 100 
millimeters. Fortunately this was 
easily accessible in the hold. It was 
backbreaking work to lug the heavy 
sections out of their stowage and to 
the ship’s workshop, but Major 
Trent’s marines were able to ac- 
complish this without too much 
grumbling. The pipe sections were 
cut to size, each two and a half 
meters in length. One end of each of 
the tubes was sealed with a heavy, 
welded flange. The crude cannon, 
eight of them, were beginning to 
take shape. 

There was no time to introduce 
too many refinements. Pamir had 
broken through the light barrier, 
was well away on the second leg of 
her voyage. It was when she 
decelerated, to complete the 
passage to Llanith under sail, that 
the pirate would strike. This was a 
probability if not a certainty. The 
evidence indicated that this was 
what had happened to Lord of the 
Isles and to Sea Witch. 

Grimes discussed the prospect 
with Listowel, Willoughby, Major 
Trent and Sonya. He said, “Let’s 
face it. The principles of our light- 
jammers aren’t secret. We’re the 
only people who have had such 
ships simply because we’re the only 
people with inhabited anti-matter 
systems in our sector of space. But 
there have been articles a-plenty in 
both scientific and shipping 
journals. And the Waldegrenese 
can read.’’ 

“Waldegren?” asked Trent. 



“Yes. Waldegren. The Duchy has 
a bad record of harboring pirates.” 
He spread a chart on Listowel’s 
desk. “Now, just suppose that Wal- 
degren is monitoring our traffic 
with Llanith on the Carlotti bands. 
Oh, I know that the beam between 
our two systems doesn’t pass near 
any of the worlds of the Duchy — 
but a small relay station, possibly 
fully automated, could have been 
planted anywhere along the line of 
sight. If we knew just where to look 
for it we could find it. Mphm. Well, 
one of our lightjammers lifts off 
from Lorn. The routine message is 
sent. ETA and all the rest of it. 
Cargo such and such, consigned to 
so and so. Then the pirate — a light- 
jammer, of course — lifts off from 
Darnstadt. So far I’ve told only 
two people of the contents of the 
signal I received from Admiral 
Kravitz— Captain Listowel, of 
course, and Sonya. She helped with 
the decoding. But it all ties in. 
There has been lightjammer 
activity in the Duchy — and what 
would Waldegren want lightjam- 
mers for?” 

“Piracy,” said Listowel. 

“Still, we must be careful. We 
aren’t at war with Waldegren. The 
evidence indicates, however, that 
Waldegren has built at least one 
lightjammer. After all, the essential 
guts of such a ship, a sphere of anti- 
matter, aren’t all that hard to come 
by. There are other anti-matter 
systems besides the Llanithi Con- 
sortium. But where was I? Oh, yes.

The pirate lifts off from Darnstadt, 
sets course and adjusts speed so as 
to intercept our ship as she 
decelerates to sub-light velocity. 
She jams the Carlotti bands, at- 
tacks, seizes.” 

“And what about the passengers 
and crew?” asked Listowel. 

“If they’re lucky. Captain, they’ll 
be prisoners on Darnstadt. That’s 
why we want to take prisoners 
ourselves.” 

“The pirate,” said Trent, “will 
probably be armed with rockets, or 
projectile cannon. Not laser — 
unless the Waldegren scientists 
have worked out some way of 
making it effective at near-light 
speeds. Quick-firing cannon, I’d 
say.” 

“Quicker than your muzzle- 
loaders,” said Sonya to Grimes. 

“Almost certainly,” he agreed. 
“But surprise is a good weapon.” 

Ill 

AS PAMIR sped through the 
11 nothingness the work of 
arming her progressed. Ahead of 
her blazed the stars, those toward 
which she was steering and those 
whose laggard light she was 
overhauling. Filters and shields 
protected her crew from the dan- 
gerous radiations that were a re- 
sultant of her velocity. Yet there 
was still visible light, harsh, 
intensely blue, light that should not 
have been seen but that, 



nonetheless, seemed to penetrate 
even opaque plating. 

But apart from the watch officers 
nobody had time to look out into 
space. Those cannon had to be 
finished and mounted. There was 
black powder to be mixed and 
tested, the charges to be packed in 
plastic bags. There were the springs 
to be contrived to carry and 
dampen the recoil of the guns. 
There were bags of shot to be made 
up. 

Pamir, fortunately, was so 
designed as to make the mounting 
of archaic cannon practicable. As a 
lightjammer, handled inside a 
planetary atmosphere like an air- 
ship, she was fitted with ballast 
tanks which, of course, were emp- 
tied on lift-off. Grimes decided to 
place his batteries, each of four 
guns, in the port and starboard 
wing tanks. To begin with, two 
crude airlocks were made and 
welded to the manhole doors 
leading into the compartments. 
Spacesuited and carrying laser 
tools the chief officer and the 
engineer went into the tanks, first 
to cut the gunports, then to 
strengthen the frames to take the 
weight of the artillery, the thrust of 
the recoil. The gun mountings were 
then passed in and welded into 
place. 

The pieces themselves slid in 
cradles and, on being fired, would 
be driven back against powerful 
springs, locking in the fully recoiled 
position. Loading was fast

enough — first the bag of powder, 
then the shot, with a ram-rod to 
shove all well home. Firing would 
have to be deferred until the guns 
were run out again. For firing 
Grimes had first considered 
electrical contacts, then some sort 
of flintlock. He was amused by his 
final solution — touch-hole and slow 
match. Even though hand lasers 
were the slow matches — within the 
confines of the ship they worked 
well enough — the principle was a 
reversion to the very earliest days of 
firearms. 

Then there was the drilling of 
Trent’s marines. They took it all 
cheerfully enough, making a game 
of it. 

Finally Grimes was satisfied 
with the rate of fire — although none 
of the guns had yet actually been 
fired — under simulated conditions. 

Grimes checked personally the 
ready-use lockers for the bagged 
charges, the lockers for the im- 
provised shot, the arrangements for 
passing more ammunition through 
into the tanks should it become 
necessary, communications. But 
there was one more problem. A row 
of gunports, with the muzzles of 
guns protruding, is easily de- 
tectable. He decided that the can- 
non would be retained in the fully 
recoiled position until just before 
firing and the ports concealed by 
sheets of plastic. He ordered, too, 
that the laser batteries be with- 
drawn into their recesses. They 
were of no use, anyhow. 



« t^ eceleration sta_ 

^ tions,” Listowel ordered. 

“Make that action stations,” said 
Grimes quietly. “I’m taking over 
now, Captain.” 

“So I’m just your sailing 
master,” Listowel commented, but 
cheerfully enough. “At your 
service, Commodore.” He pressed 
the bell push. A coded clangor 
sounded and resounded, short long, 
short long, short long — the Morse 
A. Fowler fidgeted in his seat at the 
console, the one from which he 
would fire and, hopefully, direct the 
sounding rockets, each of which 
was now fitted with a high-explo- 
sive warhead. The batteries of muz- 
zle loaders were manned. 
Spacesuited marines were standing 
by the drainpipe artillery, three to a 
gun. Handy to the airlocks over the 
manhole doors were the am- 
munition parties. 

“Cut reaction drive.” 

“Cut reaction drive, sir.” 

The muted thunder of the rockets 
suddenly ceased. 

Slowly, carefully, as though this 
were no more than a routine 
deceleration, Listowel trimmed his 
sails, pivoting them about the masts 
so that the light from the glaring 
Llanithi stars, almost dead ahead, 
was striking their reflecting sur- 
faces at an oblique angle. It had to 
be done gradually. If Pamir were 
suddenly taken aback she would be 
dismasted. The Doppler Log was 
starting to wind down. 25.111111 
. .25.111110. .25.111109. The

lower courses were turned to 
exercise full braking effect. The 
lower topsails next — the upper 
topsails — the top gallants. Speed 
was dropping fast. Inside the iner- 
tialess ship there was no sensory 
hint of the titanic forces being 
brought into play, forces that in a 
normal vessel would have smeared 
ship and crew across the sky in a 
blaze of raw energy. 

The log was still winding down, 
although the count was slowing.

1 . 000001 .. 

1 . 000001 .. 

1 . 000000 . 

Now there was sensation, a 
feeling of unbearable tension. 
Something had to give. Something, 
somewhere, snapped suddenly. 
Ahead the sparse scattering of stars 
diminished in number. The Rim 
Suns — astern in actuality — sud- 
denly flickered out, reappeared in 
their proper relative bearing. 

“Mr. Wallasey,” said Listowel, 
“make the routine ETA call to 
Llanith.” He looked inquiringly 
toward Grimes, who said, “Yes. 
We maintain routine — until some- 
body or something interferes with 
it.” 

Wallasey was having his troubles. 
From the switched-on Carlotti 
transceiver issued a continuous 
warbling note. 

“Interference — ” he muttered. 

“Jamming,” amended Grimes. 
“This is it, Captain. Any moment 



now.” He looked around the con- 
trol room. Fowler was tense over 
his console, as was Denby, the 
second officer, at the radar. 
Wallasey was still twiddling knobs 
at the Carlotti set. Sonya and 
Sandra were sitting quietly in their 
chairs, apparently taking only a 
mild interest in the proceedings — 
but either woman. Grimes well 
knew, could spring into action at an 
instant’s notice. And Sandra, after 
all, could handle a lightjammer al- 
most as well as her husband. 

There was nobody else on the 
bridge. Willoughby was below, in 
charge of the damage control party, 
and Major Trent was looking after 
the guns manned by his men. 

“Target,” reported Denby. 
“Green seventy-five. Range fifty ki- 
lometers. Closing.” 

“Thank you, Mr. Denby. Keep 
us informed,” said Grimes. 

“Green now seventy-five, still. 
Positive altitude five degrees, 
increasing.” 

“Range?” 

“Forty — and closing.” 

Grimes spoke into the 
microphone that carried his voice 
through the ship and into the gun- 
ners’ helmet speakers. “This is the 
commodore. The enemy has been 
sighted. She is closing fast. From 
now on there will be frequent 
changes of trajectory. Stand by to 
open fire on command. Over.” 
Trent’s voice came in reply, “All 
is ready, sir. Guns loaded, but not 
yet run out.” 



ON THE ACCOUNT 



109 




“Don’t run them out until you get 
the order to fire, Major.” 

“Green seventy-four, sir. Range 
thirty, closing. Positive altitude 
seven degrees. Increasing slowly.” 
“Captain,” said Grimes, “roll us 
seven degrees to port. I want to 
keep our friend exactly on the plane 
of our ecliptic. We can’t aim the 
guns individually — we have to aim 
the ship. Understand?” 
“Understood, Commodore.” The 
directional gyroscopes rumbled 
briefly as Pamir was turned about 
her long axis. 

“And now, Captain, start al- 
tering course to port. Just behave as 
you would normally in trying to 
avoid a close quarters situation.” 
Looking through the viewports 
Grimes saw the sails being trim- 
med. With the light from the 
Llanith sun as the wind, Pamir was 
being steadied on to a starboard 
tack. 

“Green eighty-five, opening. 
Range twenty-five, holding. 
Altitude zero.” 

Grimes got up from his chair, 
went to the big binoculars on their 
universal mount. He had no trouble 
picking up the intruder. Her suit of 
sails made her a big enough target. 

He said, “Mr. Wallasey, don’t 
bother any more with the Carlotti 
set. Try calling on NST.” 

“Very good, sir.” The third of- 
ficer turned to the normal space- 
time transceiver, equipment 
suitable for use only at short 
ranges. “What shall I say, sir?” 



“Pamir to unidentified vessel. 
What ship? What are your inten- 
tions? You know.” 

“Pamir to unidentified vessel,” 
said Wallasey, speaking slowly and 
distinctly. “Come in, please.” 
Almost immediately a voice re- 
plied, “Unidentified vessel to 
Pamir. Maintain your present 
course and speed. Open your air- 
locks to receive my boarding 
party.” There was a slight accent. 
Waldegren? It sounded like it. 

Listowel turned to Grimes. 
“What now. Commodore?” 

Grimes grinned. “If we didn’t 
have ladies present I’d tell him to 
get stuffed. Pass me the mike, Mr. 
Wallasey.” Then he said, in what 
Sonya referred to as his best quar- 
terdeck voice, “Pamir to 
unidentified vessel. Identify your- 
self at once. And sheer off. You are 
getting in my way.” 

“Unidentified vessel to Pamir. 
Open your airlock doors. Prepare 
for boarding party. Do not offer 
resistance. Over.” 

“Mphm,” grunted Grimes, re- 
leasing the pressure of his thumb on 
the transmit button of the 
microphone. “I want you to turn 
away, Listowel. You are master of 
an unarmed merchant vessel. You 
can’t fight, so you run. Put the 
Llanith sun dead astern. As long as 
he sees us doing all the right things 
he’ll be lulled into a sense of 
security.” 

Driving surfaces pivoted about 
their masts, the east sails presenting 



110 



GALAXY 




their black sides to the source of 
light, the west sails their reflective 
sides. The ship came around fast. 
And then, on all four masts, the 
reflective surfaces were spread to 
catch the full force of the photon 
gale. 

“Bearing green one six five. 
Altitude zero. Range nineteen. 
Closing.” 

“Must have hung out the crew’s 
washing,” commented Listowel. 
“I’m afraid that I can’t squeeze any 
more out of Pamir.” 

“It doesn’t matter,” Grimes told 
him. “We want her to catch up.” 
He looked astern through the 
binoculars. Pamir’s sails cut off the 
glare from the Llanith sun and the 
raider was clearly visible on the 
starboard quarter. Like Pamir she 
was a four-master, with a cruciform 
rig, but additional triangular sails 
had been set between the masts. 
Running free this would give her a 
decided advantage. 

“Range fifteen. Fourteen. 
Closing.” 

“Sir?” asked Fowler appealingly. 

“No,” said Grimes. “Not yet. 
We must consider the legalities. 
She must fire the first shot.” 

“But those legalities would only 
apply, sir, if we were a merchant 
vessel. But we aren’t. We’re an 
auxiliary cruiser of the Rim Worlds 
Navy — ” 

“A space-lawyer yet!” com- 
mented Grimes admiringly. The 
young man was right, of course. 
He, Grimes, should have played 



heavy commodore as soon as 
contact had been made with the 
pirate, demanding her uncondi- 
tional surrender. He might have 
done just that if he had a real war- 
ship under his feet. He decided that, 
after all, his own way of playing it 
was the best, especially since the 
other ship obviously had the heels 
of Pamir. He said, “You can play 
with your rockets as soon as I give 
the word, not before. And when you 
do use them, try for the enemy’s 
rigging, his masts and sails.” 
“Bearing green one Five oh. 
Closing. Range nine. Closing.” 
“This is the commodore. Action 
will be opened shortly. It seems 
likely that the starboard broadside 
will be the first to be used.” 
“Unidentified ship to Pamir. 
You’ve been asking for trouble. 
You are about to get it. Over.” 
“You have our permission to tell 
him to get stuffed, John,” said 
Sonya sweetly. 

“Bearing green one two five. 
Range seven. Closing.” 

Shortening sail, thought Grimes, 
watching through the binoculars. 
There’re those tri-s’ls or whatever 
he calls ’em coming in. And I can 
see ports opening. Boat bays ? Or 
gunports? 

A gout of yellow flame spurted 
from one of the openings in the 
raider’s hull, just abaft the masts. A 
long time later, it seemed, there was 
an explosion ahead of Pamir, about 
half a kilometer distant, a sudden 
rose of pale fire burgeoning in the

111 




blackness. So the pirate was using 
projectile weapons. 

“Unidentified vessel — ” the joke 
was wearing thin — “to Pamir. That 
was the last warning. Surrender or 
take the consequences.” 

“Bearing green ninety. Range 
five, four, three — closing.” 

No identification marks , thought 
Grimes, studying the other vessel 
through the powerful glasses. Could 
be one of ours, save for a few, 
subtle points of difference . 

He said to Fowler. “All right. 
Lieutenant. You may open fire.” 

He saw the first rocket flash from 
its launching tube, trailing a wake 
of blue flame, spinning a flimsy 
filament of incandescence over the 
shortening distance between the 
two ships. It got a little over 
halfway, and then a stream of 
tracer came hosepiping from a gun- 
port, met it, eroded it into ragged 
and harmless fragments of spinning 
debris. The warhead didn’t explode. 

“Rapid fire!” ordered Grimes. 
“Get the other five rockets out and 
on the way as quickly as possible. 
Don’t bother guiding them in. One 
might get through.” 

None did. The pirate’s machine 
gunners were fast. 

“Range one. Point seven five. 
Point five.” 

“Resistance is useless,” came the 
voice from the NST transceiver. 

“Starboard broadside, fire,” said 
Grimes into the intercom 
microphone. 

He was not altogether prepared 



for what happened. He was 
expecting to see the enemy’s sails 
shredded, his masts cut down, by 
the shot that he had prepared, the 
same sort of shot that had been 
used so effectively during the days 
of sail on Earth, the bags of scrap 
metal, nuts and bolts, lengths of 
metal chain. He had forgotten, 
though, that one of the old men-o’- 
war never, when firing a broadside, 
fired all guns simultaneously — they 
were fired in quick succession. 

Pamir lurched. It was more than 
a mere lurch. It was as though a 
giant palm had swatted her on her 
starboard side. The north and south 
masts were carried away, each of 
them falling to starboard as the 
ship was driven to port by the re- 
coil, the yards of each of them rip- 
ping the sails of the east mast, be- 
coming inextricably entangled with 
the rigging. 

“You got her, sir!” Fowler was 
yelling. “You got her!” 

Grimes, who had been knocked 
down by the violent lateral ac- 
celeration, got groggily to his feet, 
staggered to the starboard 
viewports. The raider was, indeed, 
in a sorrier state than Pamir. In ad- 
dition to the damage to her rigging 
there were gaping holes in her shell 
plating, through some of which 
smoke and flame flared explosively, 
like rocket exhausts. Her control 
room ports were bright with the 
ruddy glare of an internal fire. She 
was spinning slowly about her long 
axis. The one undamaged main

spar, the east mast, which had been 
on her starboard side, shielded 
from Pamir’s guns, lifted into view 
as she rolled, lifted, then dipped 
toward the other ship — and held 
steady, a long, metal lance. 
Freakishly, then, the rotary motion 
ceased. Perhaps a survivor was still 
exercising some sort of control, was 
determined to exact vengeance 
before his death. And on the far 
side air, mixed with the gases of 
combusion, was still escaping into 
the vacuum, inexorably driving the 
total wreck on to the near- wreck. 

“Range closing,” Denby was 
saying, over and over again. 
“Range closing. Range closing.” 

“Reaction drive!” ordered 
Grimes. “Get us out of here!” He 
could visualize the end of that long 
spar driving through Pamir’s shell 
plating and piercing the vacuum 
chamber in which the sphere of 
anti-matter was suspended in the 
strong magnetic fields. It was not a 
nice thing to think about. 

Listowel made no reply. The cap- 
tain was slumped in his seat, 
unmoving. 

Sandra was shaking her husband 
violently. “Ralph! Wake up! Wake 
up!” Then, snarling wordlessly, she 
pulled him from his chair, letting 
him drift to the deck. Before she 
was properly seated in his place her 
long fingers were on the controls. 
She snarled again, then snapped, 
“Something’s wrong, Commo- 
dore!” 

“Starboard broadside,” ordered 



Grimes into the intercom 
microphone. “Fire!” That should 
push them away and clear from 
their dying attacker. 

“The guns are off their mounts,” 
came a hysterical voice. “We have 
casualties — ” 

Denby was still calling out range 
figures — in meters now — but it was 
not necessary. The shattered, 
burning raider was too close and 
was getting closer. 

“Roll her, Sandra!” shouted 
Grimes. 

“But our east mast is some 
protection — ” 

“It’s not. Roll her, damn you!” 

“Roll her,” repeated Sonya. “He 
knows what he’s doing.” She added 
quietly, “I hope.” 

The gyroscope controls and the 
gyroscopes themselves were still

working. There was the initial 
rumble as the flywheels, started to 
turn, then the low hum. The drifting 
wreck slid slowly from view, dip- 
ping below the starboard viewport 
rims — but if Denby’s radar 
readings were to be credited 
disaster was now only millimeters 
distant. 

Grimes ordered, “Rotate through 
ninety degrees. Let me know when 
you’re on eighty-five.” 

The next few seconds could have 
been twice that many years. 

“Eighty-five,” stated Sandra at 
last. 

“Port battery — fire.” 

Again Pamir was slammed by 
that giant hand and was swatted 
clear of the dying raider’s mur- 
derous sidelong advance. The 
tracks of the two ships diverged — 
but not fast enough, thought 
Grimes. He said urgently, “I don’t 
care how you do it, Sandra, but get 
some of our sails trimmed to catch 
the light from Llanith. We must get 
out of here, and fast!” 

“But we should board,” said 
Sonya. “There may be survivors. 
There will be evidence. The fire will 
burn itself out once the atmosphere 
in the ship is exhausted.” 

“Not that sort of fire. Do some- 
thing, Sandra.” 

Using the gyroscopes she turned 
the ship, at last getting the sails of 
the one surviving mast trimmed to 
the photon gale. Astern the wreck 
dwindled in a second to the merest 
point of light — and then, briefly, 



became a speck of such brilliance as 
to sear the retinas of those who 
watched. It had happened as 
Grimes had been sure that it must 
happen. The casing of the sphere of 
anti-matter had been warped by the 
heat of the fire — or, perhaps, had 
been buckled by an explosion. 
Contact with normal matter had 
been inevitable. 

The pirate was gone, every atom 
of her structure canceled out. 

The pirate was gone and Pamir 
was drifting, crippled. It was the 
time for the licking of wounds, the 
assessment of damage before, hope- 
fully, limping into port under jury 
rig. Men aboard Pamir had been in- 
jured, perhaps killed. It had been an 
expensive victory. And Grimes 
knew that it would not have been so 
expensive had he remembered to 
fire the guns of his broadside in suc- 
cession instead of all at once. 

He realized that Fowler, the gun- 
nery officer, was saying something 
to him. “It was brilliant, sir, 
brilliant, the way you fought the 
action — ” 

He replied slowly, “We won. 
But—” 

“But?” The young man’s face 
wore a puzzled expression. 

“But you can’t make an omelet 
without breaking a few eggs,” 
contributed Sonya rather too 
brightly. 

“But you should be able to make 
one without blowing up the 
kitchen,” was all that Grimes was 
able to manage in way of reply. ★

DARK SKY 



6 








T HE Alothian sea slaps the 
grainy beach with one of its 
thunderous and magnificently 
foamy breakers, making a noise 
like someone outside my old- 
fashioned glassine Port-A-Home 
trying to break in forcibly. 

I know there is no threat. Not 
now. Not the kind that once hung 
over Alph, my only child. But still, 
seeming to recall a phrase, “. and 
the sea billows roll,” from an 
ancient Terran work (my academic 
specialty), I find myself involun- 
tarily going over to the windowport 
to look, again filled with stub- 
born hope. 

Few stars not wanderers light the 
immense distances of this forbid- 
ding corner of the multiverse. As I 
peer through the windowport, the 
dark sky above gives birth to a scat- 
tering of falling stars. These wan- 
dering ones seem to walk that sur- 
face as if it were solid ebony. 
Actually they are in accelerated 
free fall, coming from some place, 
perhaps even the vicinity of Terra’s 
yellow star, that I cannot see from 
Aloth, and going to some place be- 
yond. Except for those caught in 
Aloth’s sodden gravity and pulled 
down into searing heat and disin- 
tegration. They wink out, cease to 
exist. Things do get out of control 
sometimes in our universes, no 
matter what the scientists say. 

People get caught in this gravity, 
too. It was only a few years ago and 
I am reminded of that time when — 
oh, I might have been able to do 



something. A cold horror grips me 
as I remember. 

HE last time you did that 
X you nearly drowned.” I put 
on some more suntan lotion and, 
rubbing it into the skin of my belly, 
I began to think I was getting to be 
flabby. “And don’t go into the 
water,” I admonished. I lay down, 
toes aimed directly at Sonner, and I 
felt hot and fat and flabby and 
burned. Our family has always 
lived beside one sea or another and 
been fat, flabby, sunburned and in- 
tellectual. Nothing ever changed. 
Nothing got out of hand. Not even 
on the other suburban planets 
where we had been staying out the 
grants from different universities. 

We still didn’t know everything 
about Aloth, but what we had 
learned was mostly quite ordinary. 
Even the few curious, inexplicable 
things that happened seemed to Fit 
the usual pattern. The Olgoth child, 
for example, had disappeared under 
mysterious circumstances, but 
people were always disappearing on 
newly habited planets, only to reap- 
pear a few cycles later with ad- 
venturous stories. 

“I didn’t.” He stood over me in 
all his preschool height, arms 
akimbo, feet apart, casting a 
shadow over my belly, where I most 
wanted to have more tan. My son. 
My Alph. 

It had been misty and cloudy for 
several weeks of the first sun, Sol, 
and now that Sonner, its mate, had 



117 




revolved into position, shedding a 
somewhat harsher mixture of ul- 
traviolet and infrared, we were 
carefully acquiring our protective 
coats of tan all over again. Alph 
was already a little red. Or was his 
skin now slightly purplish? It was 
hard to see in this light. Would he 
mutate, too, like some of the more 
recent natives? Some do and some 
don’t. Nobody knows why. 

“Better cover up,” I said, “or get 
in out of the sun.” 

Alph’s shadow was still there 
and, turning, I got the blaze of Son- 
ner in my eye. I blinked. “Didn’t 
what?” I rolled over on my side. It 
is a grotesque position, but 
necessary if one is to get an even 
golden tan, and I could talk, if that 
continued to prove necessary. I rub- 
bed suntan lotion onto the visible 
portion of my right breast and the 
bright balls skated over the surface 
of the skin. 

“It was a lake,” he said. “And I 
didn’t nearly drown.” Button-eyed, 
he was trying to frown at me, but in 
that bright light and on that smooth 
face no lines would form at all, not 
then. He looked like a teddy bear. 
Would he ever be trim and athletic 
and muscular? Would he be? No, I 
thought. He would be a bigger 
teddy bear like me and like his 
father and like all of us. Behind him 
two breakers curving up the beach 
crashed mightily and shot sky- 
ward, exploding into mist. An 
ancient Terran poet had once called 
them seastacks, like haystacks of 



the old era. A carpet of foam, 
thicker than Terran foam, spread 
almost to Alph’s feet. 

“At the lake on Terra,” I agreed. 
“And you were drowning, no doubt 
about it. You didn’t even come up 
the first time. You just went down. 
I had to dive in after you with my 
clothes on.” I had made an 
enormous splash, as might be ex- 
pected, a belly-whopper they used 
to call it, and the dress, a cheap 
thing for picnics, was ruined. I had 
just learned I would never be 
pregnant again. Still, I had saved 
him. But that was only a lake and 
this was the mighty ocean of Aloth. 
I did not want to have to belly- 
whop into those breakers. 

J UST beyond the tumbling of the 
crests a few surfers bobbed 
up and down, dark, glistening, 
prone and paddling with their 
hands or kneeling and bending as 
they went through a wave. Some- 
times they moved far out, beyond 
the place where the waves foamed, 
sitting astraddle their boards in a 
group, like seabirds, talking, 
shouting, each to each. Fractions of 
shouts often reached my ears on the 
ragged wind. They were the Ugly 
Brothers, as we humorously called 
them, with some of their friends, 
five in all, all natives, born on Aloth 
of the first pioneer parents, and 
they had all begun to mutate. The 
differences were slight — a nearly 
imperceptible shift in the color of 
the skin toward an orange shade.

for instance — faint but absolutely 
undeniable. 

“I wasn’t drowning. I liked it 
down there. It was pretty,” Alph 
protested. 

“Just looking around, huh? And 
you’d come up for air when you 
were good and ready. Thought you 
were an Alothian fish. Well, you’re 
just a Terran boy and I couldn’t 
take a chance.” 

“You got worried.” It was an ac- 
cusation. If I hadn’t been so foolish 
and gotten worried it would not 
have turned out badly! That’s what 
he was telling me. He cocked an 
eyebrow, as if pondering. Close to 
Alothia a covey of catamarans 
dived over the horizon, one by one. 
The sea out there looked smooth. 

“Sure, I got worried,” I said. 
“You can’t live under water, 
whether you think so or not.” I 
couldn’t help laughing. If we were 
fish, what would he be? A perch, an 
alocanth, or a catfish? I would be a 
cod, I felt. And his granddad, the 
autocrat of the table, would be a 
chambered nautilus. The sea swept 
up behind Alph again, closer to my 
beach towel. I would have to move 
soon. 

“That was a long time ago,” 
Alph said, dismissing it. 

“Only two years Terra-time,” I 
said. 

“That’s a long time,” he af- 
firmed. For him it was a long time. 
Time was different for him. 

“Look. I can walk on it.” Alph 
jumped onto the foam. “I’m 



dancing.” Splashes of sand and 
water arched up and fell on me. A 
small colony of purplish sand crabs 
rushed for their holes, scuttling 
sideways along the lines of fine- 
ground debris left by the edge of the 
last wave, peering at us out of their 
stalked eyes. At the edges of their 
holes they rocked back and forth, 
edging cautiously into the sand and 
waiting, as if hoping that if they 
waited long enough we would all 
pack up and go away. One of the 
younger exobiologists at the in- 
stitute was sure they were in- 
telligent and hoped soon to es- 
tablish communication with them. 
He was on the wrong track: they 
were intelligent but uncommuni- 
cative. Suddenly I felt uneasy under 
their stares and threw a handful of 
sand, but none of them moved even 
a purplish eyestalk. 

“Hey, I made quicksand,” Alph 
said. He trampled a boggy hole in 
the smooth surface of the beach. 
Could it hungrily open up at any 
moment and swallow us? “Hey, I 
need another wave. Come on, you 
old ocean.” 

AS IF to oblige him the old ocean 
xl slopped up and deposited 
another wave at his feet. 

“You’re getting filthy,” I said, 
rising up on my elbow. “Get out of 
there.” 

He held his nose with one hand 
and raised the other up high. 
“Help, I’m sinking in the 
quicksand.” 



IN THIS DARK SKY

“Out. Right now.” 

He pulled out a single sandy leg 
and then the other, two sandy 
frankfurters that he put down on 
the towel beside me first and then 
up on my belly. The frankfurters 
went up and down as 1 breathed. 
The sun was getting lower. The 
crabs moved in closer, waving their 
stalked eyes, to watch. 

“Why couldn’t we?” he asked. 
“Why couldn’t we what?” 

“Oh, live under water.” 

“We’re not fishes.” 

“Well, walk on the water.” 

“You mean swim.” 

“No, I mean walk.” 

“Impossible! You’d sink like a 
rock. I know. I had to pull that 
rock out of the drink.” 

“In the Old Book, He did it, the 
old Terran Sorcerer,” Alph said, 
screwing up his eyes to remember 
the name. “Jizukrist! He cured 
people and brought this man back 
to life and He made fishes and 
wine. And the wizard Daedalus 
could fly.” Alph sat up then, 
picking up handfuls of sand and 
sifting them and squinting at me. 

“That was on Terra a long time 
ago, in ancient Judea and ancient 
Greece. Things like that don’t hap- 
pen any more.” The sand was 
sifting into my hair, into my ear 
and finally into my mouth. 

“We can do it. The Followers did 
it.” 

“Not any more. Not this 
Follower.” 

“Why?” 



“We just don’t believe enough, 
perhaps,” I said. The sand was 
tickling my ear. 

“I believe,” Alph said. 

“Is that why you stepped out 
onto that lake?” 

“No, I wasn’t thinking about 
that,” he said. He turned away and 
looked at the sea. “That was an ac- 
cident. I thought it was ground and 
it was just some old grass sticking 
out into the water. I didn’t have 
time to believe.” 

“You can’t walk on water,” I 
said emphatically, closing my eyes 
tight. “Not even if you believe like 
the ancient Terran Sorcerer in the 
Old Book. Maybe you shouldn’t 
read my textbooks.” 

“Not even on the Dead Sea in the 
old Holy Land on Terra?” He was 
sharp, all right. I had told him 
about that, about the salt in the 
water, so that you could float. I had 
walked out once when we (Alph’s 
father and I) had toured there on 
our honeymoon and, after I had 
walked just so far out, I couldn’t 
keep my feet down and they flipped 
up and my head went under.. It was 
like some chemical bath. My eyes 
were still stinging an hour later, but 
it was true, you could not sink in 
that water. 

“No. Not even there.” 

A wave washed up and lapped at 
my beach towel and the little crabs 
scurried nearer and then receded. I 
sat up, only to discover that Alph 
was wading out into the foam, 
looking into the sea. All the little 



120 



GALAXY 




crabs seemed to be lined up and 
waving their eyestalks and feelers 
and watching, just as I was. Off in 
the distance a large wave began to 
roll in and the surfers, eyeing it, 
turned and began to paddle fu- 
riously. The taller of the two Ugly 
Brothers watched the boiling foam 
approach, got to his knees as he 
started to move, and then rose up to 
his feet, picked up by the mo- 
mentum, and then, waveringly at 
first, began to walk to the shore. 

One by one the other surfers were 
caught up too and they in turn 
stood up. 

Riding the curler of the wave, just 
before the place where it was 
breaking, the tall brother walked, 
bronze, muscular, like some ancient 
Terran sea god, walking the waves 
on into shore. 

The invisible hairs on the skin 
of my arms rose as I realized that 
he was not on a surfboard at all but 
was actually skimming the waves 
with his bare feet. The little pur- 
plish crabs waved their eyestalks as 



if in recognition. I was transfixed. 

Alph, like a fledgling bird, stared 
at the surfers with arms outspread 
and began to walk. The lowering 
sun cast its rays around him and my 
eyes burned to tears as he walked 
out to meet them, no longer a little 
teddy bear, but a different being in 
a different element. The spent fury 
of the wave lapped up onto my 
beach towel and, drenched and 
shivering and unable to move a 
muscle, 1 watched him go away. 
That was the first time he ran away, 
walking over that strange and 
foamy sea. 

Yesterday 1 saw them on the 
beach again and tonight, just now, 
when I heard that wave slap the 
beach, when I thought I heard that 
noise outside, I hoped quite un- 
reasonably that it might somehow 
be Alph trying to come back home 
again. But it wasn’t. I only want my 
son to come back home again. Is 
that too much to ask? And, my 
God, I think I see that lowering sun 
again, in this dark sky. ★

GIRL 



ROBERT F. YOUNG 






mM 



mm 






H IS first name was Robinson 
his last should have been 
Crusoe. It wasn’t though -it was 
Feeney. His friends called him 
Robin for short. 

When the chronocane came bar- 
reling out of the pea-soup mists of 
the sea of time he was hanging from 
the fantail of the Long Long Ago 
in a magnetic bo’s’n’s seat, 
overhauling the excursion ship's 
auxiliary drive. The minute he saw 
what he was in for he jammed the 
fountain pen-sized energizer he had 



122 




just removed into his jacket 
pocket — an instant later he was 
lifted from his perch and borne 
away on a tumultuous tide of blue- 
nesses and blurs and cinammon- 
colored convolutions. 

Meanwhile, the Long Long Ago, 
by that strange quirk of fate for 
which time-storms are noted, sailed 
on unscathed. 

Confronted with what appeared 
to be imminent death, Robin 
sought to soften it by thinking of 
how dirt-poor he was, how dirt- 
poor he had always been and how 
dirt-poor he probably always would 
have been. But the countermeasure 
proved to be unnecessary, for the 
chronocane turned out to have a 
heart as well as an eye and, after 
whisking him this when and that, 
deposited him unharmed upon the 
shore of an ISLE. 

Or, to break down the acronym, 
an Integrated Superficial Len- 
ticular Ephemeron. 

Robin deduced the nature of his 
new surroundings even before he 
glanced up at the sky and saw that 
the sun occupied a dozen different 
positions at once, each only slightly 
removed from the others but 
combining with them to give an 
overall effect of a much larger 
body. The phenomenon resulted, as 
Robin well knew, from the orbital 
variations of Earth since its 
formation and from the presence of 
more than one latitude. 

Getting to his feet, he surveyed 
the scene in greater detail. Strictly 



speaking, the shore on which the 
storm had deposited him was 
nothing of the sort. It was merely 
the outer edge of the place-time he 
happened to be inhabiting. Beyond 
it the sea stretched endlessly away 
somewhat in the manner of the up- 
per surface of a vast cloud bank. In 
a way, being on an ISLE was like 
being in heaven and, as a matter of 
fact, all Robin had to do to get back 
to Earth was to jump. But the 
trouble was he didn’t know where 
he would land — or when. Possibly 
in Mycenae, circa 1500 b.c. — 
possibly in Times Square, circa 
1950. Most likely in the middle of 
the Pacific Ocean, circa it-didn’t- 
make-any-difference. 

But perhaps things weren’t as bad 
as they seemed. In his jacket pocket 
reposed a time-drive energizer that 
needed nothing more in the way of 
repairs than a good cleaning, and 
there was an excellent chance that 
one or more of the place-times 
constituting the ISLE might 
contain the materials for a time 
raft. True, the ISLE might begin 
deteriorating any moment — but 
then again it might hang on for 
ages. 

H E TURNED his back on the 
sea and took a good look at 
the place-time he was occupying. It 
consisted of an unbroken plain 
about a mile wide and a mile and a 
half long. Spears and shields were 
scattered over the immediate fore- 
ground. Examining them, he tied in

the former with the ancient Greek 
poleis and the latter with the an- 
cient Persian Empire. Unques- 
tionably he was standing on the 
Plain of Marathon, the mise en 
scene of the historic battle in 
which the Athenians and the 
Plataeans had put to rout an 
invading army that outnumbered 
them ten to one. 

Beyond the plain, in lieu of the 
historic heights, rose a big green hill 
that Robin recognized instantly. It 
was Hill 29, the site of Captain 
“Idaho” Murphy’s famous stand 
during World War III. 

To Robin’s left the plain was 
bordered by the sea; to his right it 
gave way to two other place-times. 
One of them — a narrow strip of 
forest — formed a continuation of 
the littoral, while the other — a wide 
expanse of tree-dotted countryside 
containing a number of grim- 
looking castles — was conterminous 
to the plain and Hill 29. 

He explored the forest first. 

It consisted of first-growth ma- 
ples, beeches, oaks and elms. They 
were tall and straight, the aisles 
between their boles virtually free 
from sunlight. Robin noticed a 
slight drop in temperature, but this 
was due solely to the shielding fo- 
liage. Each place-time had its own 
sun, but owing to their proximity 
they functioned as one and as a 
result the ISLE’s components 
received equal amounts of warmth 
and light. 

He came at length to an Amerin- 



dian village of twenty Iroquoian 
long-houses. He decided that the 
place-time was from stone age 
North America and constituted the 
scene of an intertribal battle that, 
while it may have eluded history, 
lingered on in the unconscious 
minds of those whose ancestors had 
been involved in it. 

He entered one of the long- 
houses and looked around. It was 
uninhabited of course (an ISLE’s 
endemic life forms were limited to 
meiofauna), but it contained a 
sizable cache of Iroquoian corn 
However, he was certain the ISLE 
possessed more appetizing fare 
than desiccated corn, and didn’t 
take any of it with him. 

He spent the remainder of the 
day (according to his wristwatch- 
calendar, it was Saturday) and the 
better part of the next exploring his 
island home. All told, it comprised 
twelve place-times. He had already 
identified three of them — the Plain 
of Marathon, circa 490 b.c.; the 
Amerindian Forest, circa the sixth- 
century a.d.; and Hill 29, circa 
1998 a.d., He mentally catalogued 
the castle-haunted countryside 
adjoining the first three as King 
Arthur’s Kingdom, circa 550 a.d., 
and the rest as follows: Coventry, 
circa the time of Lady Godiva’s 
ride; Minos, circa 2,000 b.c.; the 
Rubicon, circa 49 b.c.; Grendel 
Land (i.e., the scene of BeowulFs 
encounter with the monster), circa 
500 a.d.; Yasnava Polyana 

(Tolstoy’s estate), circa 1908 a.d.; 



124

the first MacDougall’s hamburger 
stand, circa 1972 a.d.; Generous 
George’s Used-car Lot', circa 1974 
a.d. (Robin would have been at a 
loss concerning these two if it 
hadn’t been for the self-explanatory 
signs over their entrances); and Fu- 
tureville, circa sometime in the far 
future (he was at a loss concerning 



this one and only assumed that the 
figure-nine shaped structures he 
glimpsed in the distance constituted 
a community. 

He drew a map in his mind for 
future reference. 

In most cases only a rep- 
resentative section of the place- 
time was present. However, 




MAP OF ISLE 



125 














Generous George’s Used-car Lot, 
MacDougall’s and Yasnaya Pol- 
yana appeared to be intact. 

The Used-car Lot delighted him. 
Not only did it adjoin 
MacDougall’s, making for con- 
venience in the way of meals, but 
the cars parked in it would provide 
him with the materials he needed to 
build a raft. In addition, many of 
them contained tools and in one of 
them — a beat-up Chevy van — he 
found an acetylene torch and tanks 
and a small electric arc-welder. 

Yasnaya Polyana afforded the 
most direct route to the sea, but it 
was heavily forested in places and 
he decided that when the time came 
he would launch the raft from the 
Plain of Marathon. This would in- 
volve passing through part of King 
Arthur's Kingdom, but the terrain 
didn’t look too bad and was 
definitely a better bet than that of 
Minos. 

I I KE most such lots. Generous 
^ George’s was strung with 
overhead wires from which hung lit- 
tle plastic pennants of various 
colors. In one corner stood a small 
wooden structure in which were an 
office and a lavatory. The former 
contained a desk, two chairs, a 
collapsible cot and a miscellany of 
other items. The wall next to the 
door held a metal fuse box. It was 
connected through quinque-dimen- 
sional space to the same source of 
power that supplied the original, 
and the lot’s lights — four overhead 



self-activating fluorescent units — 
would go on as soon as darkness 
fell. For the same reason the taps in 
the lavatory and those in 
MacDougall’s dispensed running 
water, while the two fuel pumps just 
within the lot’s entrance dispensed 
regular and premium gasoline. 

Robin rigged up an outdoor 
shower and connected it to the cold- 
water tap in the lavatory by means 
of heater-hose lengths com- 
mandeered from several of the cars. 
After washing up he went to work. 
To obtain parts he tore down a 
1970 Buick Riviera, a 1972 
Chevrolet Bel Air and a 1969 Ford 
Torino. The job took him five days. 
On the sixth — his eighth day on the 
ISLE — he went prospecting for 
quartz. 

It was almost dark before, high 
on the seaward side of Hill 29, he 
found the kind he was looking for. 
After mining the small amount he 
needed for the time-drive he 
pocketed it and turned to leave. As 
he did so he happened to glance out 
to sea. He gasped. A ship was ap- 
proaching the ISLE. 

As time-ships go it was not a 
large one and its time vanes — or 
sails — seemed disproportionately 
wide. Obviously it had just surfaced 
or he would have noticed it before. 
As he watched, it touched the edge 
of the Plain of Marathon and came 
to a halt. 

ISLEs, owing to their ephemeral 
nature and to the navigational 
problems they gave rise to, were 



126 



GALAXY 




generally avoided like the plague. 
Consequently Robin found it hard 
to believe his eyes. Nevertheless, 
they were giving it to him straight. 
As he stared, the forward nacelle 
opened and seven passengers and/ 
or time sailors disembarked. One of 
them appeared to be a prisoner. 

II 

N O ONE living in Robinson 
Feeney’s day really knew 
what an ISLE was, but there were 
plenty of theories making the 
rounds and one of them — the one 
Robin himself subscribed to — has 
turned out to be substantially cor- 
rect. 

It proposed that the collective un- 
conscious is tied in with the space- 
time continuum and that when any 
given race memory becomes firmly 
enough established it materializes 
in the form of a “place-time” on the 
so-called surface of the so-called 
temporal sea. By the same token, 
when the race memory behind any 
given place-time lapses for any 
reason, that place-time deteriorates 
and disappears and, because of the 
physical factors involved, the placer 
times that have combined with it to 
form an ISLE deteriorate and 
disappear also. Hence, the lon- 
gevity of an ISLE is arbitrarily de- 
termined by the longevity of the 
weakest of its components. 

The creative process that results 
in a place-time can be likened to a 
projector throwing an image on a 



screen, the projector being the mass 
memory of the human race at any 
given time and the screen being the 
surface of the temporal sea. 
Granted, the analogy is an oversim- 
plification, but it is only by 
oversimplifying complex phe- 
nomena such as the one here in- 
volved that we can conceive of them 
at all. Therefore, although we are 
dealing here with five dimensions 
and the make-believe room in 
which we have placed our make- 
believe projector and screen com- 
prises only four (the fourth being 
time as it is generally understood), 
the analogy still enables us to ob- 
tain some idea of what a place- 
time — and by extension, an ISLE — 
is all about. But it must be re- 
membered that what we are vis- 
ualizing in four dimensions 
actually involves five and that our 
screen encompasses yesterday, 
today and tomorrow and is not sub- 
ject to the same laws that govern 
our earthly existence. And it must 
also be remembered that our pro- 
jector represents only one of a long 
line of similar projectors that 
stretches from the remote past 
through the present and on into the 
far future. 

These qualifications make a 
number of things clear: (1) how a 
place-time can seemingly have only 
one surface and yet be dimen- 
sionally identical to the original; (2) 
why chronology proper plays no 
part in the grouping together of 
place-times into ISLEs; (3) why

many of the historic locales that 
men still remember do not exist on 
the so-called surface of the so- 
called temporal sea. 

Finally, the incongruities that 
confront us when we view an ISLE 
are the product not of the ISLE but 
of our preconditioning. Were we to 
view such phenomena solely with 
respect to the similarity of their 
components’ seasons, all the while 
keeping in mind that geography is a 
three-dimensional concept, these 
incongruities would not exist. Suf- 
fice to say, whatever it is that 
causes place-times to unite into 
ISLEs, once the union is consum- 
mated the resultant montage is ce- 
mented by a twenty-four-hour cycle 
of day and night that repeats itself 
over and over until the ISLE’s de- 
mise. And time, while it passes in 
one sense, does not, in another, pass 
at all. 

NDERSTANDABLY Robin 
was filled with joy at the sight 
of the ship. However, his joy didn’t 
overwhelm his natural caution and, 
instead of running down the side of 
Hill 29 and across the plain to wel- 
come the new arrivals, he blended 
himself against the trunk of a 
nearby tree and sat down to watch. 

The landing party had set out 
single file in the direction of the 
Amerindian Forest. Some mem- 
bers carried boxes, others sacks. 
The one Robin had taken for 
a prisoner carried nothing — even 
so, he seemed to be having trouble 



keeping up with the others. Possibly 
because he was little more than half 
their size. 

When the party was halfway to 
the forest someone on the ship 
closed the forward nacelle — and a 
moment later the ship backed away 
from the ISLE, extended its sails 
and sank out of sight. 

Crestfallen, Robin stared at 
where it had been. The good old 
Feeney luck was working overtime. 

But he was certain that the ship 
would be back in the near future to 
pick up those it had left here. 
Perhaps in the meantime he could 
make their acquaintance and assure 
a berth for himself on the trip back 
to the present. First, however, he 
would do a little spy work and find 
out what they were doing on the 
ISLE. 

He watched the landing party 
make its way single-file across the 
plain. By the time it reached the 
forest and disappeared among the 
trees the sun was low in the west — 
however, he decided to wait a while 
longer before leaving the hill. Dusk 
came. He saw smoke rising above 
the distant treetops and knew that 
the newcomers had made camp. 
Descending the hillside diagonally 
into King Arthur’s Kingdom, he 
made his way across the ancient 
English countryside to his desti- 
nation. By now night had fallen and 
the sky was crammed with stars. 
Literally crammed with them, be- 
cause it contained not only the 
visible stars of more than one 




128 



GALAXY 




latitude, but the visible stars as they 
appeared from the various place- 
times. Like the sun, the gibbous 
moon that presently rose in the east 
occupied a dozen different places at 
once. 

Entering the forest, Robin saw 
firelight flickering among the trees 
up ahead and he made his way cau- 
tiously toward its source. At length 
he found himself on the outskirts of 
the Amerindian village. Creeping 
closer and peering around the 
corner of one of the long-houses, he 
saw that the fire had been built in 
front of the largest dwelling. It was 
not the one he had entered earlier 
and he wished now that it had been, 
for he had a hunch that it was the 
new arrivals’ headquarters and that 
this was far from the first time they 
had visited the ISLE. 

Suspended over the fire on a ma- 
keshift tripod was a big black kettle 
and from it rose steam. Within the 
circle of firelight six men were 
grouped around a glittering pile of 
finger rings, bracelets, amulets, 
necklaces, brooches, earrings and 
various other items, arguing in loud 
voices. 

Tied to a tree on the other side of 
the fire was a girl. 

She had copper-colored hair and 
amber eyes. Her features were at 
once delicate and strong. Her eye- 
brows made Robin think of 
swallows flying south. 

Her dress appeared to be silk and 
was either ultra modern or ultra an- 
cient. Golden in color, it fell all the 



way to her golden-slippered feet. In 
a number of places it had been torn, 
as though ornaments had been rip- 
ped from it. Returning his gaze to 
the pile of jewelry, Robin saw 
several iridescent sequins. 

Slowly the truth dawned on him. 
At the time of her capture she had 
been wearing all those jewels and 
all those ornaments! 

He studied her captors. Their 
speech seemed to consist of grunts 
and squeals. He was unable to 
make out what they were saying. 
The men averaged about seven and 
a half feet in height, were swarthy 
of skin and wore bloomerlike 
trousers that hung in tatters around 
their knees. Their black hair was 
long, ^ unkempt, and kept falling 
over their eyes. Their faces were 
either clean-shaven or naturally 
hairless — probably the latter. They 
wore plastic rings in their noses and 
their teeth, either naturally dis- 
colored or artificially blackened, 
were filed to points. Each had a 
long cutlass stuck through his belt. 

Buccaneers? Cannibals? Hill- 
billies? Robin found himself 
thinking of them as “Buccanni- 
billies.” 

Identifying their civilization was 
something else again. One thing 
was for certain — they were not 
from his. Nor were they from any 
of the past ones he had come into 
contact with. Perhaps they came 
from the future. Impossible. 
Contact had never been made with 
the future. 



GIRL SATURDAY

The men had apparently decided 
to postpone dividing their captive’s 
jewelry till later in the evening. 
They were now clustered around 
the fire and, as Robin watched, first 
one and then another reached into 
the steaming kettle, fished out a 
large chunk of meat and devoured 
it in two or three bites. The proce- 
dure was repeated again and again, 
to the accompaniment of loud lip- 
smacking and deep grunts. 

The captive looked on from con- 
temptuous eyes. Presently one of 
the men — an eight-foot giant with 
tangled hair hanging over his 
face — fished out a piece of meat 
and took it to the tree where she 
was tied. After pinching her cheek 
he held the meat against her mouth. 
She almost bit his finger off. 

Yelling, he raised his hand as 
though to strike her. But the hand 
never descended. The scathing look 
she gave him was so intense and so 
utterly devoid of fear that he turned 
and slunk away. 

But her reprieve was temporary 
at best and Robin knew it. 

He sighed. The last thing in the 
world he wanted was a Girl Friday. 
Nevertheless, he was shortly going 
to have one. 



Ill 

L EAVING the village behind him, 
* he hurried to the edge of the 
forest. He hauled all the dead wood 
he could find out onto the plain and 



piled it into a large pyre. He applied 
a match, waited till the flames got 
going good, then began stomping 
around it, giving vent to series of 
what he thought were pretty good 
Indian war whoops. He kept up his 
howling for about five minutes, 
then reentered the forest. 

He took a circuitous course back 
to the village, careful to make as lit- 
tle noise as possible. The little he 
did make was presently drowned 
out by the girl's captors as they 
crashed through the underbrush on 
a direct route to the plain. 

He had gambled on their leaving 
only one of their number behind 
and this was exactly what they had 
done. The man turned out to be 
none other than the Good 
Samaritan who had offered the girl 
part of his supper. He was 
bolstering his courage with the 
contents of a large jug and eyeing 
the girl covetously through his hair. 

Robin found a good-sized rock 
and clobbered him on the back of 
the head. He dropped the jug and 
toppled like a felled tree. 

Robin borrowed his cutlass long 
enough to cut the girl’s plastic 
bonds. Disbelief had come into her 
eyes when he had felled her captor. 
Now hope replaced it. But she 
didn't collapse into Robin’s arms 
with a profound sigh of thanks- 
giving as he half expected her to-— 
instead she ran over to the pile of 
loot and began slipping amulets 
onto her arms, bracelets onto her 
wrists and rings onto her fingers.

Robin seized her arm and tried to 
pull her to her feet. She pushed him 
away. 

“Begone!” she said in Anatolian. 

Anatolian was the language of 
ancient Asia Minor. Foremost 
among the countries where it had 
been spoken was Lydia. 

A bell began ringing in Robin’s 
mind, but as yet it wasn’t loud 
enough for him to get its import. 

Again he seized the girl’s arm, 
and this time he succeeded in 
pulling her to her feet. 

“Do you want to be here when 
they get back and have them tie you 
to that tree again?” he demanded. 

Her amber eyes widened in sur- 
prise at his easy familiarity with her 
language. They also snapped. 

“I will not leave without my 
jewels! Release me this instant!” 

He did so. “We’ll take them with 
us, but there’s no time for you to 
put them on.” 

He removed his jacket, spread it 
on the ground and piled the rest of 
the jewels and ornaments on it. 
Then he brought the ends together, 
stood up and slung the makeshift 
sack over his shoulder. “Come on,” 
he said, and set out in the direction 
of King Arthur’s Kingdom. 

T HIS time the girl obeyed 
him — for the very good reason, 
no doubt, that he was carrying her 
ornaments and her jewels — and 
together they hurried through the 
forest. From the plain came the 
shouts of her captors, but there was 



no indication as yet that they had 
discovered they had been faked out 
of position. 

“What’s your name?” Robin 
asked the girl presently, as they left 
the forest behind them. 

He told her his. 

Almost a full minute passed. 
Then, just as he was beginning to 
think she wasn’t going to tell him, 
she said, “Manijeh.” 

“That’s a pretty name. Where are 
you from?” 

Silence. 

“All right — don’t tell me.” 

“I am from Sardis.” 

Sardis. Again the bell began to 
ring, but still not loudly enough. 

“Why did those men capture 
you?” ' 

“They did not tell me, so 1 do not 
know. Not only do they act like 
pigs, they talk like swine. Except 
one, who spoke as I do — but him 
they left behind. 

Robin helped her across a little 
brook, careful not to hold her arm a 
single second longer than was 
absolutely necessary. 

“Why do you think they captured 
you?” ' 

“To extort riches from my father, 
of course.” 

“Your father must be very — ” 
Robin began — and stopped. While 
he and Manijeh had been talking 
the shouts of her captors had faded 
away. Now the voices had started 
up again, much closer at hand, and 
he knew her escape had been dis- 
covered. “Hurry,” he told Manijeh.

“They’ll start looking for us now.” 

He led the way at a brisk dogtrot 
to Generous George’s’ Used-car 
Lot. The fluorescent units had 
come on, creating an oasis of 
brightness in the night. The 
paleness of Manijeh’s face as she 
followed him into the lot attested to 
her wonderment and fear, but she 
said nothing. 

He took her to the office, told her 
to stay inside, then ran over to the 
parts bank he had accumulated and 
began assembling a field-fence 
adapter. He worked swiftly, aware 
that he and Manijeh might have left 
a trail that their pursuers could 
follow by starlight. When he 
finished he carried the adapter into 
the office and connected it to an 
unused circuit of the fuse box. Two 
spare fuse cartridges and a fuse- 
puller were lying at the base of the 
box, a fact that he had noted ear- 
lier. He stood one of the cartridges 
on end and placed the fuse-puller 
next to it so he could insert the 
former in a hurry when the time 
came. 

Meanwhile, Manijeh had been 
putting on her jewelry. Robin 
stared at her. She looked like a 
Christmas tree. Disgusted, he 
returned to the parts bank and built 
five post pacs. He installed one on 
the lot’s northwest corner, one on 
the northeast corner, one on the 
southwest corner and the remaining 
two on the southwest and southeast 
corners of MacDougall’s parking 
lot. As he was installing the last one 



he glimpsed a furtive movement in 
the darkness beyond the radiance 
shed by MacDougall’s outdoor 
fluorescents, which had also come 
on with the departure of daylight. 

H E FINISHED the job fast and 
rose to his feet. As he did so 
he caught the gleam of a cutlass out 
of the corner of his eye. Another. 
The office was visible around the 
edge of the hamburger stand. It was 
a million miles away — perhaps two. 
Whichever, he knew he’d never be 
able to reach it in time. 

“Manijeh!” he shouted. “In the 
box on the wall there’s a little pair 
of tongs. Pick up the upright 
cylinder with them and shove it into 
the empty slot — do it now! But 
whatever you do, don’t touch it!” 
He repeated the instructions 
twice. Hell, she’d never understand! 
How could she? She had never seen 
a fuse box before in her life, to say 
nothing of a fuse cartridge or a 
fuse-puller. Even if she did by some 
miracle succeed in gripping the car- 
tridge she’d never succeed in 
inserting it properly. 

He could see the pirates, 
kidnapers or whatever they were 
now. There were six of them (ap- 
parently the Good Samaritan had 
recovered) and they were pounding 
out of the darkness of Yasnaya Pol- 
yana toward MacDougall’s for all 
they were worth. Robin began to 
run for the office. Halfway there he 
shouted the instructions again. 
Abruptly Manijeh appeared in 



GIRL SATURDAY 



133 




the doorway. She stomped her foot. 
“I did pick it up!” she said. “I did 
shove it in! I didn’t touch it! Do you 
think I am deaf?” 

Robin slowed to a halt, turned 
around. She had indeed activated 
the fence. The foremost pirate 
bounced back six feet when he 
collided with it and sparks shot 
from his hair. An identical fate 
overtook the second and their howls 
of pain were faintly audible from 
beyond the invisible barrier. The 
remaining four braked just in time 
and, as Robin watched, helped their 
fallen comrades to their feet. Then 
the six of them slunk back into the 
shadows of Yasnaya Polyana, there 
no doubt to reconnoiter and to try 
to devise a means to breach the 
fence. 

Robin wasn’t worried. From 
what he had seen of them so far, it 
would tax their know-how to 
breach chicken-wire. 

Whistling, he covered the rest of 
the distance to the office. Manijeh 
was still standing in the doorway, 
her jewels having an iridescent glow 
in the blazing fluorescence, her eyes 
fixed on the darkness of Yasnaya 
Polyana into which the Buccan- 
nibillies had disappeared. 

“I knew they were arrant 
cowards,” she said. “I knew it all 
along.” 

All the jewelry that had been in 
the makeshift sack was now on 
her — diamond- and ruby-studded 
golden disks and brooches, silver 
bracelets, golden amulets, lapis 



lazuli necklaces, emerald earrings, 
diamond fingerrings, golden shoe 
buckles . Robin began to have 
some idea of the true extent of the 
fortune that her kidnapers had let 
slip through their fingers. 

Could there possibly be more 
where it came from? The mere 
thought staggered his imagination. 

But that was because he was 
looking at the situation through the 
eyes of a poor man. For all he 
knew, her father might own all of 
Asia Minor. He might even have 
gone down in history. History was 
full of rich men — rich men and 
despots. Maybe her father was 
both. 

“Who is your father, Manijeh?” 
he asked. 

“King Croesus,” she answered. 

IV 

R OBIN’S father was as poor as a 
- church mouse. 

Once he had said to Robin, Steer 
clear of rich bitches, son. They like 
nothing better than to spit on 
people like us .. 

Another time he had said. Son, if 
you can find a way to do it marry a 
rich bitch some day. It just might 
beat being on welfare — you never 
know . 

From which it can be seen that 
Robin’s father was nothing if he 
was not inconsistent. 

This was because he was afflicted 
with an ambivalent attitude toward 
the rich. As a lifetime welfarer and 



134 



GALAXY 




a charter member of the Interna- 
tional Brotherhood of United 
Welfare Recipients he instinctively 
regarded the wealthy as the natural 
enemy — and as a lifetime member 
of a society devoted to meretricious 
materialism he couldn’t help but 
admire them for having accumu- 
lated so many possessions. 

Robin himself was also afflicted 
with ah ambivalent attitude toward 
the rich, but his ambivalence was 
more extreme than his father’s. He, 
too, instinctively regarded them as 
a natural enemy, but he did not si- 
multaneously admire them -he 
worshiped them. There was a tea- 
spoonful of Honor^ de Balzac in 
him, a tablespoonful of F. Scott 
Fitzgerald and a cupful of Horatio 
Alger. 

To aggravate his present position 
still further, his attitude toward the 
fair sex had been molded by the 
complete works of Zane Grey, 
James Oliver Curwood, Harold 
Bell Wright and Charles Alden 
Seltzer, books which his Great 
Grandfather Feeney had picked up 
at a rummage sale and which had 
been with the Feeney family ever 
since. 

Consequently, while his reaction 
to his Girl Friday’s momentous dis- 
closure involved two separate emo- 
tions, the romantic haze through 
which he was accustomed to regard 
womankind made it impossible for 
either to manifest itself. 

Otherwise, however, his mind 
was quite clear and the ungodly 



crew’s motive in being on the ISLE 
was a mystery no longer. They were 
using it as a hideout while their con- 
federates negotiated a ransom set- 
tlement with Croesus. 

A thought occurred to him. “Ma- 
nijeh, did they make you write a let- 
ter to your father?” 

“They tried to make me. When I 
would not they pulled all the combs 
from my hair and said they would 
show them to him as proof I was 
their prisoner. The pigs!” 

Robin wondered if they would 
have returned her unharmed. He 
doubted it. In any case, they no 
longer had the option. It was up to 
him to return her — to take her back 
to Sardis — preferably before the 
ransom was paid. 

He informed her of his intentions. 

She put her hands on her hips and 
looked at him scornfully. “Take me 
back to Sardis — ha! How can you 
take me back to Sardis when you 
cannot possibly know which way to 
go?” She tossed her head in the di- 
rection taken by the retreating 
kidnapers. “After those stupid 
goats stole me from my father’s 
garden they became lost in a fog — 
and I do not think even they know 
which direction to take to get back 
down from this bewitched moun- 
tain top! How then can you know?” 

Robin was justifiably piqued. “It 
just so happens that I do know,” he 
said. “And what’s even more im- 
portant, I know how.” He pointed 
to the time raft, which at this stage 
of its construction even he had to

admit didn’t inspire much confi- 
dence. “We’re going to Sardis in 
that — after I finish building it. Now 
that I’ve got you to help me it’ll be 
done in no time.” 

She drew herself up in the 
doorway and looked down at him 
disdainfully. “I do not know from 
what wretched land you come,” 
she said, “but from your apparel I 
would judge you to be a goatherd 
from the hills of Mysia and from 
your manners a swineherd from the 
outlands of Phrygia. The daughter 
of King Croesus would not so much 
as lift her little finger to help 
either — and were either to address 
her in so presumptuous a fashion in 
her father’s kingdom a hole would 
be drilled through his tongue and a 
redhot skewer thrust through it!” 
Poor Robin didn’t know what to 
say. He should have been indignant, 
but he wasn’t. Instead of instinc- 
tively wanting to tell her off for 
what she had said he instinctively 
wanted to apologize for what he 
had said. 

I T WAS what he got for not li- 
stening to his father. Stay on 
dole and you’ll keep your dignity, 
the elder Feeney had told him and 
he had been right. You’d never 
catch a professional welfarer letting 
some rich bitch walk all over him — 
he had pride. True, a welfarer never 
had very much money, but the dif- 
ference between him and someone 
like Robin, who placed inde- 
pendence above common sense, was 



that the former never had to worry 
about where his money was coming 
from while the latter had to worry 
all the time. Unless — unlike 

Robin — he had an aptitude for one 
of the more lucrative trades or 
professions. Otherwise he had to 
scrounge and pay for his inde- 
pendence with his pride. If he were 
Robin he studied languages day and 
night so he could go to sea — only to 
discover that a ship’s linguist, even 
when his natural mechanical ability 
automatically qualified him for a 
first-class mechanic’s rating, 
enjoyed a status similar to cabin 
boy and didn’t draw a great deal 
more in the way of wages. 

Robin sighed. Maybe his ten 
sisters and his eight brothers had 
been right when they unanimously 
voted him the black sheep of the 
family. However you looked at it, 
the time for him to assert himself 
was on hand. So maybe he was as 
poor as a church mouse and his Girl 
Friday as rich as a five- and dime- 
store heiress — she was still his Girl 
Friday. He’d show her who was the 
boss right now. 

“I’m hungry,” Manijeh declared. 
“Fetch me something to eat.” 

Robin didn’t remember his re- 
solve till he was halfway to 
MacDougall’s. By then, of course, 
it was too late. It had been too late 
in the first place. In MacDougall’s 
he made coffee, french fries and 
hamburgers (there was enough food 
in the refrigerators and the freezers 
and the cupboards to last him and a 



136 



GALAXY 




Manijeh a whole year), prepared a 
tray for her and one for himself and 
carried both back to the office. It 
was strange fare for a sixth-century 
b.c. maiden and for a moment he 
thought she was going to turn up 
her nose at it. She didn’t, though, 
and after the first bite devoured 
everything on her tray. 

It was clear, however, from the 
frigid glances she repeatedly cast/ in 
his direction that having to sit at the 
same table with a common 

goatherd outraged her sensibilities. 
But she made no comment. 

It had been his intention to in- 
form her in the best James Oliver 
Curwood tradition that the cot in 
the office was hers and that he 
would bed down either in 

MacDougall’s or in the back seat of 
one of the used cars. However, this 
proved to be unnecessary. 

“Begone,” she said when he 
picked up the trays. “I would 
sleep.” 

Sadly he carried the trays and the 
plastic cups and containers back to 
MacDougall’s and dumped them 
into one of the disposal bins. Then 
he returned to the used-car lot and 
after finding a back seat that was 
almost wide enough for him to 
stretch out on, settled down for the 
night. 

T 'HE kidnapers showed up early 
the next morning, arrayed 
themselves a respectful distance be- 
yond the fence and brandished their 
cutlasses. Robin ignored them, rig- 



ged a tarpaulin around the outdoor 
shower and washed himself 
vigorously, wishing mournfully for 
a razor (he had by this time grown a 
frizzly brown beard). He was about 
to step outside when Manijeh ap- 
peared in the office doorway, 
yawning. Fortunately his clothes 
were within reach and he put them 
on. 

“Why have you been pouring 
water on your head?” Manijeh 
asked when he stepped into the 
morning sunshine. 

He glared at her. “It’s an old 
Mysian custom.” 

She parted the tarp and peered 
inside. 

“To turn it on,” Robin explained, 
“you twist that little round disk. To 
turn it off, you twist it the other 
way. You stand under that bucket 
with the holes in its bottom. The 
water’s cold and there isn’t any— 
any — ” (he discovered there was no 
Anatolian word for soap). “Well 
anyway,” he concluded, “you’ll 
find it an invigorating experience.” 

“Ha!” Manijeh said. “You 
would never catch the daughter of 
King Croesus pouring water on her 
head.” 

And she had called him a Mysian 
goatherd! 

“Fetch me something to eat,” the 
daughter of King Croesus 
continued. “I am hungry.” 

He made fresh coffee and fried 
hamburgers and they breakfasted 
at Generous George’s desk. 

“Why didn’t you cook some

more of those delicious little bis- 
cuits?” Manijeh asked. 

Biscuits? “Oh, you mean french 
fries. I’ll fix some for dinner. 
Meanwhile,” Robin added mean- 
ingfully, “I’ve got work to do.” 
After disposing of the breakfast 
dishes he got busy on the raft. The 
pirates watched for a while, bran- 
dishing their cutlasses whenever he 
happened to glance in their di- 
rection — then, evidently becoming 
bored, they withdrew into the rocky 
wilderness of Minos. 

Noon came. “I am hungry,” Ma- 
nijeh called from the office 
doorway. “Fetch me something to 
eat.” 

Robin gritted his teeth. Some 
Girl Friday he had! Come to think 
of it, though, he'd rescued her on a 
Saturday, which made her his Girl 
Saturday, not Friday. 

The good old Feeney luck had 
been working overtime, as usual. 

While he was peeling the potatoes 
for the french fries in MacDougall’s 
kitchen he sensed someone standing 
just behind him and out of the 
corner of his eye he saw Manijeh 
peering around his shoulder. 

“Is that the way the little biscuits 
are made?” she asked. 

“That’s only the first step. Here, 
let me show you.” 

Craftily he slipped the paring 
knife into her right hand and placed 
a potato in her left. “You turn it 
like this, see? And while you’re 
turning it, you peel.” 

After she finished with the 



peeling he showed her how to put 
the potatoes in the slicer and then 
how to put them in the wire basket 
and immerse them in the deep fat, 
which he had heated beforehand. 
Then he showed her how to fry 
hamburgers and make coffee. She 
was so thrilled that several times 
she clapped her hands out of sheer 
delight and when the boiling water 
rose magically from the lower to 
the upper globe of the coffee- 
maker, she uttered an awed: 
“Ahhhhhh!” 

They ate at one of MacDougall’s 
indoor tables. Afterward, Robin 
showed Manijeh where to throw 
away the disposable cups and 
plates. Then he went back to work. 
The day grew hot. Along about 
three o’clock he heard water run- 
ning, and looking in the direction of 
the outdoor shower he saw a golden 
dress hanging over the ring to which 
the tarp was attached. That evening 
at supper her copper-colored hair, 
still not quite dry but neatly 
combed (apparently she had 
secreted one of her combs from her 
kidnapers), fell in straight moist 
tresses to her shoulders and shone 
softly in the subdued fluorescence 
of MacDougall’s dining room. 

I I KE most such establishments, 
^ Generous George’s Used-car 
Lot was a heat trap. The mornings 
weren’t bad, but every afternoon 
the temperature climbed into the 
high nineties and — as the sea of 
time was incapable of providing so

much as a zephyr and as the fence 
would have kept it out in any 
case — there was no relief till the sun 
went down. And even then there 
wasn’t very much to speak of. The 
only shade available (discounting 
the ephemeral shadows cast by the 
office and the hamburger stand) 
was that thrown by a great oak that 
stood in the wedge of Yasnaya Pol- 
yana the field-fence had made part 
of the car lot/MacDougall com- 
plex. And this was not available to 
Robin because he was building the 
raft in the center of the car lot and 
couldn’t afford to take time off ex- 
cept to eat and sleep. 

But while the shade was not 
available to Robin, it was available 
to his Girl Saturday. She set the 
more comfortable of the two office 
chairs under the tree and sat there 
by the hour, polishing her jewelry 
with an old chamois cloth she had 
found in one of the cars. Occa- 
sionally she grew bored and took a 
walk around the lot, looking at this 
used car and that, a baffled 
expression on her face. When the 
pirates came around, as was their 
custom once or twice a day, she 
would interrupt her perambulations 
or her polishing long enough to 
stick out her tongue at them. After 
several futile attempts to breach the 
invisible barrier by rolling boulders 
from Minos up Hill 29 and letting 
them come tumbling down the 
slope and into the fence, they had 
apparently given up and now 
confined their activities to sitting on 



the ground in the shade of a rock or 
tree and watching Robin work, a 
pastime that seemed to be enjoying 
greater and greater popularity on 
the ISLE. 

At first Manijeh paid the. raft not 
the slightest attention, but as it 
began to acquire form she evinced 
an increasing interest in it. At 
length — one afternoon when the 
temperature was nudging a 
hundred — she came over to where 
he was working and asked what he 
was making. 

He was lying on a creeper under 
the deck plating, installing a Revlin 
relay-instigator that he had built 
the night before. He propelled 
himself out into the sunlight, stared 
up at her in disbelief. 

“I thought I told you. It’s what 
I’m going to take you back to 
Sardis in.” 

“You did tell me. But you didn’t 
tell me what you call it.” 

“It’s a raft.” 

“She looked around. “I do not 
see any water.” 

“Of course you don’t — it’s not 
that kind of a raft.” 

“And we are going to Sardis on 
it?” 

“That’s right.” 

“Ha!” 

“You didn’t say ‘ha’ the other 
night when I put up the fence,” 
Robin said. 

“What fence?” 

He pointed to the pirates, who 
were lolling in the shade of a big 
Minoan boulder. “The fence that 



GIRL SATURDAY 



139 




keeps them from coming in here, 
chopping me into mincemeat and 
carrying you off.” 

She looked in the direction he 
had indicated. “I do not see any 
fence.” 

“Naturally you don’t. It’s in- 
visible.” 

She put her hands on her hips and 
gazed down at him. “Your face is 
dirty,” she observed. 

The abrupt change of subject dis- 
concerted him and for a moment he 
forgot how dirt-poor he was, had 
always been and always would be 
and that she was the daughter of 
one of the richest men in all 
creation. 

“Of course it’s dirty,” he said. 
“And I’m tired and I’m thirsty, too. 
And do you know why? It’s because 
I’ve been working myself half to 
death to get you off this 'moun- 
taintop’ and safely back to your 
father’s kingdom — ” 

She looked at him for a long 
time. Then, without another word, 
she turned and walked away. 

Awed by his outburst, he pro- 
pelled himself back under the raft 
and began plying an end wrench. 
Some time later, out of the corner 
of his eye, he saw Manijeh coming 
out of the office carrying a paper 
cup. He gaped. Presently the raft 
cut her from view till all he could 
see were her feet. 

“Well, are you going to come out 
and quench your thirst or not?” she 
said. “Or do you perhaps think I 
am going to crawl under there with 



this container of water and hold it 
while you drink?” 

Slowly he propelled himself back 
into the sunlight. He accepted the 
paper cup, drained it and handed it 
back. “Th-thanks.” 

He was about to shove him- 
self back under the raft. “Wait,” 
she said. “You forgot your 
instrument.” 

She handed him the end wrench. 
“Th-thanks,” he said again. 

It took him five more minutes to 
finish installing the instigator and 
when he reemerged into the sun- 
light he expected Manijeh to be 
gone. Instead he saw her standing 
at the other end of the raft, studying 
an electric booster motor he’d set in 
place and drilled holes for but 
hadn’t gotten around to bolting 
down. 

“I believe,” she said, “that I 
could secure this funny-looking ob- 
ject if I were to be supplied with the 
necessary instrument.” 

He handed her a socket wrench. 
She worked beside him the rest of 
the day. When evening came her 
face was as dirty as his was, all her 
knuckles were skinned and her 
million-dollar dress was a mess. 

“Tomorrow,” she said, “I will 
get up before you do and prepare 
breakfast. That way, we will be able 
to get back on the job sooner.” 

V 

F OR a while things went swim- 
mingly, although as the days 



140 



GALAXY 




passed it became increasingly clear 
to Robin that long before the raft 
was finished. King Croesus would 
have come across with the ransom. 
Something of the sort must have 
been on Manijeh’s mind, for one 
night while they were sitting in 
Generous George’s office, she said, 
“How soon will it be before we 
leave for Sardis, Ro-bin?” 

He looked up from the time-drive 
ganglion he was assembling on the 
opposite side of the desk. “I 
thought you didn’t believe 1 could 
find my way to Sardis.’’ 

. “Would I be helping you to build 
the raft if I still did not believe it?’’ 
He returned his attention to the 
ganglion. “No, 1 guess you 
wouldn’t. We should be able to 
leave in two more days.’’ 

There was a silence. Then: “Why 
is it that you wish to take me back 
to my father?” 

“Because that’s where you be- 
long.” 

There was another silence — a 
much longer one. At length: “My 
father will probably reward you 
handsomely,” she said. 

The possibility hadn’t even 
entered Robin’s mind. “I’m not 
doing it for a reward.” 

“I did not say you were.” 

He looked at her across the desk. 
That evening, as had been her 
custom since she had begun to help 
him with the raft, she had removed 
all her jewels and ornaments, 
polished them and then, after 
taking a shower, had put them all 



back on. But from some strange 
reason she didn’t seem to glitter 
quite as much as usual. 

“I guess my not thinking of a 
reward makes me seem kind of 
foolish,” he said. 

Her amber eyes snapped. “I did 
not say that either! You are putting 
words into my mouth again. 
Moreover, I think that I shall go to 
bed!” 

She did not point to the door and 
say “Begone!” but she might just as 
well have. He pocketed his tools, 
rose to his feet and picked up the 
ganglion. Eventually, he supposed, 
if he were to remain in her company 
long enough, he would get used to 
her outbursts. They no longer bug- 
ged him as much as they used to. 
But “eventually” did not apply — in 
a few more days they would part 
and he would never see her again. 

He stepped over to the doorway. 
“Good night, Manijeh,” he said. 

“Good night — Ro-bin.” 

T 'HE next morning they had a 
visitor. 

Rather, they had nine visitors — 
the six who had been left with Ma- 
nijeh on the ISLE, their con- 
federates — two in number — who 
had departed in the time ship, plus 
a third party. 

But it was the third party who 
was the actual visitor — the others 
were merely spectators. 

He stepped forward and attached 
a small, two-way magnetic 



GIRL SATURDAY 



141 




microphone to the field-fence, 
where it hung magically suspended 
in the morning air some six inches 
from his mouth. 

“My name is — ” (Robin couldn’t 
quite catch the words, but they 
sounded like “Coal Bin”), he said 
in late twentieth-century English, a 
language that must have predated 
his own by centuries. “My presence 
on the periphery of your fastness 
arises from an urgent necessity to 
negotiate a satisfactory settlement 
of our dispute. I think you will find 
the terms I have to offer eminently 
equitable and, under the circum- 
stances, more than generous.” 

He was somewhat smaller than 
his uncouth friends, although un- 
questionably of the same species. 
His long black hair was thickly 
pomaded with what looked like 
axle grease and was parted 
precisely in the middle of his scalp 
and combed straight down on either 
side of his face to his shoulders, 
where it curled upward into a sort 
of semicircular eavetrough. He 
wore a canary-yellow vest. Lime- 
green jodhpurs, black imitation- 
leather leggings and narrow black 
oxfords with pointed toes. There 
was no ring in his nose and pre- 
sumably there were none in his 
ears. Nor were his teeth filed to a 
point or blackened — instead they 
were perfectly formed and daz- 
zlingly white. As he talked he 
displayed them by means of a wide 
smile that went on and off at 
regular intervals as though acti- 



vated by an automatic switch hid- 
den somewhere in his head. 

“What sort of terms?” Robin 
asked. 

“Terms pertaining to the dis- 
position of your companion and her 
paraphernalia and to your de- 
parture from this ISLE.” The smile 
went on and off like an electric 
lightbulb. “As president of our 
small but powerful labor union, the 
Brotherhood of Quinque-dimen- 
sional Engineers,” Coal Bin 
continued, “I am authorized (smile) 
to offer you — in exchange for your 
turning over to us the daughter of 
King Croesus together with the 
aforementioned paraphernalia free 
(smile) transportation on board our 
time vessel to whenever and 
wherever you are from.” 

Robin stared at him. 

“I have just returned from sixth- 
century Sardis,” Coal Bin went on, 
“where (smile) for many days I 
have been sitting at the bargaining 
table with the king himself. I regret 
(smile) to report that we were 
unable to reach a mutually satisfac- 
tory agreement.” 

B argaining table? Agree- 

'ment? Suddenly Robin under- 
stood why Coal Bin had chosen late 
twentieth-century English in which 
to conduct the conversation. Aside 
from the probability of Robin’s 
being familiar with it, it abounded 
with generalities and provided the 
speaker with an ideal means of 
dignifying the lowliest of 



142 



GALAXY 




professions, of talking around the 
truth and of calling a spade a spade 
when it was really a shovel. 

Coal Bin was far from the first to 
have elevated extortion to the level 
of the bargaining table. None of 
which explained why King Croesus 
has refused to come across with the 
ransom. 

“Surely he must have offered you 
something for Manijeh’s safe 
return,” Robin said. 

“He refused absolutely to 
recompense us in any way what- 
soever for our labor.” 

Robin was stunned. “Did he say 
why?” 

“He said (smile) that the piece of 
merchandise on which our 
bargaining power was based was of 
no use to him — that he already had 
in his possession a number of such 
commodities, that the commodity 
in question (smile) had negated 
through stubbornness and conceit 
several tentative conglomerate 
mergers with neighboring corpora- 
tions and that chattel such as she, 
being non-negotiable, was of no 
further value to him. Thus (smile) 
our little labor union has been de- 
prived of wages its members have 
honestly earned, necessitating our 
taking action to obtain whatever 
other income may be accruing 
(smile) to us.” 

“I can understand why you want 
Manijeh’s jewelry,” Robin said. 
“But why do you want her?” 

“She will bring (smile) a hand- 
some price on the Babylonian slave 



market. Meanwhile, you will have 
been suitably recompensed for your 
(smile) labors by means of a free 
voyage home. I might even offer 
you as an added inducement that 
small ring that twinkles (smile) so 
charmingly on her left little finger.” 

Robin took a deep breath. He 
managed to keep his temper, but it 
wasn’t easy. 

“No deal,” he said. 

Coal Bin blinked. “But I am 
unable (smile) to offer you more. 
Our union funds are virtually 
exhausted and must be replenished. 
Moreover (smile) you cannot but 
agree that both the girl and her 
paraphernalia are rightfully ours 
and that as the thief who stole them 
(smile) you are scarcely deserving 
of the recompense 1 proffered.” 

Again Robin managed to keep 
his temper. “Neither Manijeh nor 
her jewels belong to anyone but 
herself,” he said. 

Throughout the one-sided con- 
versation Coal Bin had kept 
glancing at the time raft. Now he 
pointed to it. 

“Surely you are not so naive as to 
think you can escape from the 
ISLE in that.” 

It was the last straw. “If you were 
working for me,” Robin said icily, 
“I’d fire you in two seconds flat. 
You know why? I don’t like the way 
you part your hair.” 

The freedom to part his hair any 
way he chose had long been the 
workingman’s most cherished 
right, more important to him even 



GIRL SATURDAY 



143 




than time-and-a-half. To question it 
was tanamount to heresy. Ap- 
parently matters hadn’t changed in 
Coal Bin’s day and age. His face 
went white, his equanimity 
vanished and he shook his fist. 

“Dirty (smile) capitalist pig!” he 
shouted. “Robber of the Poor! 
Stealer (smile) from the mouths of 
babes! Picker of the hard-working 
man’s (smile) pockets! Dirty — ” 

At this point his “fellow 
workers,” realizing that something 
had gone drastically wrong at the 
bargaining table and fearful, 
perhaps, lest their president forget 
the presence of the fence, stepped 
forward, seized his arms and, 
leaving the two-way mike behind, 
carried him bodily off into Minos. 
There they disappeared among the 
rocks, where gradually Coal Bin’s 
imprecations faded away. 

R OBIN looked at Manijeh. Ma- 
- nijeh looked at him. 

“What did he say to you, Ro-bin? 
What did you say to him?” 

“He said they wanted your 
jewels. I said they couldn’t have 
them.” 

“How can they be such pigs? 
They have already collected a huge 
ransom from my father, have they 
not?” 

Robin didn’t have the heart to tell 
her the truth. Besides, Coal Bin 
might have been lying. Suppose, 
though, he hadn’t been? In that case 
would it be fair to Manijeh to take 
her back to Sardis and dump her 



off like so much unwanted bag- 
gage? 

But if he didn’t take her back to 
Sardis, what was he going to do 
with her? He couldn’t leave her on 
the ISLE. He couldn’t take her 
home. True, his father might like 
her, but it was a cinch his eight 
brothers and his ten sisters, all of 
whom lived in the Feeney 
homestead with their wives, hus- 
bands and children and all of whom 
were on welfare, wouldn’t. All 
they’d have to do was take one look 
at her jewelry and that would be it. 

He sighed. He couldn’t re- 
member a time when he had had so 
many troubles. 

“I don’t know whether they 
collected the ransom or not, Ma- 
nijeh,” he said. “We’ll just have to 
wait and see. Meanwhile, we’re 
going to have to work on the raft all 
day today and all night tonight so 
we can launch it early tomorrow 
morning. The sooner we leave this 
‘mountaintop,’ the better.” 

She made no objection and after 
a quick breakfast they got busy. 
Manijeh had no mechanical ap- 
titude whatsoever; nevertheless she 
always seemed to know which tool 
to hand him next and always 
managed to be where she should be 
when he needed her. Equally im- 
portant, she now prepared all the 
meals, enabling him to make up for 
time he had previously lost. 

Throughout the day he expected 
her kidnapers to show up again, but 
they did not. Coal Bin worried him. 



144 



GALAXY 




So did the time ship. The former 
had brains and the latter indu- 
bitably carried weapons of a far 
more sophisticated nature than 
cutlasses. He was certain that it 
was anchored just off Minos. 

Clearly, however, Coal Bin knew 
nothing about magnetic fields — or 
he would have shorted out the fence 
at once. Thus, even if the ship car- 
ried gas grenades, lobbing one over 
the upper edge of the field — which 
was sixty feet high — and inca- 
pacitating Robin and his Girl 
Saturday, hardly would accomplish 
anything. 

Tentatively Robin concluded that 
Coal Bin planned to make his move 
after Robin deactivated the fence 
himself and he and his Girl 
Saturday were on board the time 
raft and on their way to the sea. 
When the night passed without inci- 
dent he knew this to be the case. 

VI 

B Y DAWN’S early light the 
time raft was a phenomenon to 
behold. 

Its launching wheels sported 
white sidewall belted tires and its 
main deck was completely en- 
closed. There were two port and 
two starboard windows, a wide 
forewindow just above the hooded 
prow and an even wider aftwindow 
just above the rear deck. All were 
equipped with safety glass and 
could be raised and lowered by 
means of little cranks. The cockpit 



was roomy and just behind it was 
a commodious compartment fur- 
nished with an upholstered divan 
on which Manijeh could sleep if she 
got tired during the voyage. 

The time-drive ganglion was 
located in front of the pilot’s seat, 
underneath the control panel, and 
the heavily insulated wires con- 
necting it to the fore- and aft- 
equilator-bars and the port and 
starboard interometer-strips had 
been routed underneath the main 
deck. It was preset for sixth-century 
b.c. Sardis. All Robin would have 
to do when he and Manijeh reached 
the sea was turn off the launching 
motor and throw a switch. 

The launching motor had been 
lifted intact from the Ford Torino. 
However, Robin had completely re- 
built it, increasing its HP and 
eliminating its noxious emissions — 
a true feat of legerdemain by 
twentieth-century standards, but 
child’s play for a mechanic of his 
own day and age. 

The prow was equipped with four 
prowlights — two on either side — 
and the stern with six sternlights — 
three on either side. There were 
two chronocane repellors — one 
centered on the forward equilator 
bar and the other on the aft 
equilator bar — that Robin had 
fashioned from a set of 1974 license 
plates he had found in the trunk of 
one of the used cars. 

He and Manijeh took turns in the 
shower. Then they had a farewell 
breakfast at MacDougall’s, packed 



GIRL SATURDAY 



145 




a lunch and filled a gallon thermos 
with coffee. Manijeh insisted on 
preparing an extra batch of the “lit- 
tle biscuits” to take home to her 
sisters and day was breaking when 
they at last left the stand, walked 
over to the raft and got on board. 
There was still no sign of the un- 
couth ones but Robin suspected 
they had the Lot under observation, 
probably from the brow of Hill 29. 

Presently the Lot resounded with 
the smooth rumble of the raft’s 420 
HP 8 cylinder emission-free inter- 
nal-combustion launching motor. 
After driving over to the fuel 
pumps Robin filled the tank with 
regular, then drove over to the 
office and parked as close to the 
door as he could get. He went in- 
side, pulled the fence cartridge fuse, 
ran outside and quickly reboarded 
the raft. After locking the port and 
starboard doors he surveyed the 
scene on all sides. Still no sign of 
the kidnapers. 

H E DROVE off the Lot into 
King Arthur’s Kingdom and 
began circling the base of Hill 29. 
The special fore and aft suspension 
system he had designed paid off and 
the raft rode the uneven terrain 
smoothly. But he had to be care- 
ful of hangups because of its 
low undercarriage — an unavoidable 
carry-over from the cars he had 
used for parts. 

Presently he came to a lane and 
since it led in the direction he 
wanted to take, he turned into it. 



He was able to up the raft’s speed. 
Beside him he heard Manijeh gasp. 

“My father would give half his 
kingdom for a chariot such as 
this!” she exclaimed. 

Robin concentrated on the road 
ahead, momentarily expecting the 
kidnapers to appear. He didn’t 
think they would try to destroy the 
raft for the simple reason that Ma- 
nijeh might be injured and her value 
on the Babylonian slave market im- 
paired. But he did think they would 
try to disable it. 

However, he saw no sign of them 
and presently he and Manijeh 
reached the Plain of Marathon — 
and the marsh. 

The marsh extended from the 
eastern fringe of the Amerindian 
Forest to the base of Hill 29. He 
had been unaware of its existence 
because he hadn’t passed that way 
before and because from a distance 
it looked no different from the rest 
of the terrain. 

He drove the length of it just to 
make sure there was no way of 
crossing it. There wasn’t. 

The good old Feeney luck again. 

“Why are we turning around?” 
Manijeh asked. 

“We’ve got to find another way 
to get to Sardis. This one’s out.” 

He expected a sardonic com- 
ment. Oddly none was forth- 
coming. 

Coventry would be his best bet, 
even though it involved passing 
through the whole of Arthur’s 
Kingdom. Fortunately he found a 



146 



GALAXY 




lane that roughly paralled the 
Amerindian Forest and skirted the 
higher ground where most of the 
grim-looking castles stood. But the 
lane didn’t go all the way and the 
last leg of the journey was a 
nightmare of hills and dales that 
provided not even so much as cow- 
path. At length, however, he 
glimpsed buildings in the distance 
and knew they were going to make 
it. 

He approached the town slowly. 
Its streets afforded the kidnapers 
an excellent chance to waylay them. 
But he needn’t have worried — the 
streets proved to be so narrow that 
the raft couldn’t pass through them, 
couldn’t, in fact, even enter them. 

Next, he tried Yasnaya Polyana. 
Getting there turned out to be 
another nightmare. Arriving, he 
found that wherever a route to the 
sea existed, trees had been felled to 
block it. 

The kidnapers handiwork, of 
course. They, too, had worked all 
night and the field-fence had shut 
out the sound of their labors. 

Somehow Robin managed to get 
back to the used-car lot. He knew 
he could never make the sea 
through Minos, so after fueling up 
again he drove the raft through the 
northwestern section of the place- 
time to Grendel Land. He found 
more nightmares awaiting him — 
roads barely wide enough to ac- 
commodate an oxcart, sodden 
fields, sullen hills, foreboding 
forests. In exploring the ISLE 



during his first two days as a 
castaway he had touched upon all 
the place-times, but he had seen 
them from the perspective of a man 
on foot and a man on foot sees the 
world far differently from a man on 
wheels. 

After straddling a pair of deep 
ruts through a brooding woods, 
Robin came abreast of a large hall 
with antlerlike ornaments pro- 
jecting from its gables. He had 
come across it on his previous visit 
and had identified it as Heorot, the 
mise en schne of Beowulf s 
legendary battle with the troll 
Grendel. It was mid-afternoon by 
this time, and if Manijeh had 
glanced once into the rear com- 
partment where their lunch lay, she 
had done so a dozen times. At last 
he braked the raft in the shadow of 
the hall and, after a careful look 
around, got out. 

“Would you like to have some- 
thing to eat, Manijeh?” 

She needed no second invitation. 
They ate standing up, utilizing the 
raft’s hood as a picnic table. What 
little sunlight managed to penetrate 
the perpetual overcast that 

characterized Grendel Land’s sky 
glittered harshly on her jewelry, all 
of which she had on, of course, and 
all of which she had polished to 
high heaven. As always, this an- 
noyed him. Not that he begrudged 
her the wealth the jewels 

represented — he just didn’t want it 
so frequently and flamboyantly 
thrown in his face.

S HE was standing with her back 
toward one of the hall’s aper- 
tures — a window, presumably. 
Abruptly a huge hand attached to a 
brawny arm shot out from the 
window and made a grab for her. 
Robin dove across the hood and 
pulled her out of reach just in time. 
He had a very bad moment during 
which he almost believed the hand 
and arm belonged to none other 
than Grendel himself — then, as the 
owner emerged from the window, 
he saw they were part and property 
of his old friend, the Good 
Samaritan. 

Two more of the kidnapers 
emerged from two more windows 
and approached the raft. 

Robin threw the rest of their cof- 
fee into the Good Samaritan’s eyes, 
shoved Manijeh into the raft and 
locked her door. Then he shot 
around the raft, slid behind the 
wheel and closed and locked his 
door. Meanwhile the Good 
Samaritan was rubbing his eyes and 
dancing a jig in the middle of the 
rutted road. Robin was about to 
send the raft either over or around 
him and continue in the same di- 
rection he had been traveling when 
he saw that several trees had been 
felled ahead and deduced the 
presence of a roadblock. 

Wearily he turned the raft around 
and headed back the way he had 
come. 

The road might have taken him 
and Manijeh all the way to the 
shore and had constituted their last 



remaining hope. The strip of 
Grendel Land conterminous to Fu- 
tureville and Minos was much too 
heavily forested for passage — and 
he wouldn’t have tried to go 
through Futureville in any case. 
Even on an ISLE, travel could not 
postdate the energy-source of the 
time ship — in this instance, raft — 
and were he to have entered Fu- 
tureville the raft would have come 
to a screeching halt and he and his 
Girl Saturday would have been 
worse off than before. 

So it was back to the used-car lot 
again. 

He sighed. He was reminded of a 
story he had heard once about a 
man who had built a boat in his at- 
tic and when it was finished could 
find no way of getting it downstairs 
and out of the house. 

Throughout the return trip he 
had the uncomfortable feeling that 
he had eluded the Good Samaritan 
and his friends far too easily — that 
they hadn’t really cared whether 
they captured him and Manijeh or 
not. They had behaved like three 
cats playing with two mice. 

Where were the other six cats? 



I N MINOS the raft became hung 
up on an outcropping and it 
took him better than two hours to 
work it free. Night had fallen when 
at last, tired, discouraged and 
disgusted, he drove into the lot. He 
pulled up in front of the office, 
turned off the launching motor.

entered and, finding the field-fence 
adapter unharmed, reactivated the 
fence. Then he climbed back into 
the raft and settled down to think. 

Manijeh had dozed off. 
Awakening, she said, “Why have 
we come back here again, Ro-bin?” 
“To give me a chance to figure a 
way out of the fix we’re in.” 

“Then you do not know how to 
get to Sardis after all?” 

“I’m afraid not.” 

She was silent for a while. Then: 
“I am glad. I didn’t really want to 
go home to my father from the very 
beginning.” 

Robin looked at her. “You 
didn’t? Why?” 

“Because he does not seem to 
know I am alive. All he cares about 
are his wives and concubines. In ad- 
dition to them, he has a farm where 
he raises girls the way the peasants 
raise sheep. When he isn’t thinking 
about his wives and concubines he 
is thinking about them.” 

“I’m afraid I’m going to have to 
take you back to him just the 
same,” Robin said. “Provided I can 
find a way.” 

She nodded. “I know. Like all 
Mysian goatherds, you will do 
anything for riches. I hope he 
doesn’t give you so much as a fig 
for bringing me back.” 

“Now see here — ” Robin began. 
“Your only interest in me from 
the beginning was my jewels,” Ma- 
nijeh went on. “And then, after you 
found out who my father was, your 
only interest in me was the reward. 



I know all about such things. Every 
time a prince looks at me I see 
either my jewels or my father’s 
wealth shining in his eyes. That is 
why every time my fathers tries to 
arrange a marriage for me I hide in 
my room and barricade the door.” 
She shuddered and a tear rolled 
down her cheek. “And you are just 
like they are, even though you are 
only a Mysian goatherd.” 

Robin was staring at the tear. It 
certainly seemed real enough. But 
he had no chance to find out for 
sure. All over the lot, which in his 
naivete he had assumed to be 
deserted, Buccannibillies, kid- 
napers, pirates were boiling out 
of used cars. Counting the Good 
Samaritan and his tow bud- 
dies — who had apparently out- 
distanced the raft — and Coal Bin, 
there were nine of them. Eight 
were brandishing cutlasses. The 
ninth. Coal Bin, was brandishing 
Robin’s acetylene torch.

— Think, Robinson Feeney 
said to himself. Think... 

— What is an ISLE? 

— An ISLE is an Integrated 
Superficial Lenticular Ephem- 
eron. 

— Yes, yes. But what is its 
relationship to conventional 
reality? 

— It is a montage of place- 
times that have been lifted out 
of conventional reality and 



GIRL SATURDAY 



149 




projected upon the surface of 
quinque-dimensional space. 

— Then an ISLE is connected 
to conventional reality through 
each of its place-times, is it 
not? And there is, is there not, a 
sort of quinque-dimensional 
umbilical cord connecting each 
of the segments to its original? 

— Yes. But the metaphor is 
misleading because it conjures 
up a three-dimensional image. 
Quinque-dimensionally the dis- 
tance separating the two re- 
alities is both infinite and 
nonexistent. Thus the umbilical 
cord would have to be both 
visible and invisible, without 
end and without beginning. 

— Nevertheless it would be 
possible, would it not, to 
proceed directly from a 
projected to an original reality? 

— It might be possible — if 
the time-traveler overloaded 
his time-drive energizer and 
risked ruining it. But time- 
drive energizers cost a fortune 
and — 

R OBIN drew himself up short. 

- What was he arguing about? 
What difference did it make how 
much they cost? If burning his out 
would keep Manijeh out of the 
hands of Coal Bin and himself out 
of reach of cutlasses he couldn’t ask 
for a better bargain. And he would 
never have to worry about replacing 
it — because where they were going 
he would not be able to replace it. 



Rousing himself from his brown 
study, he saw that Manijeh had 
picked up a heavy-duty socket 
wrench from the deck and was 
shaking it in the face of Coal Bin, 
who was standing several feet from 
the raft’s starboard hull trying to 
ignite the acetylene torch with what 
looked like a cigar lighter. But for 
some reason the lighter itself 
wouldn’t ignite. 

Robin started up the launching 
motor. 

Excursion ships such as the Long 
Long Age steered clear of the late 
twentieth century, hence all his 
knowledge of the year 1974 A.D. 
was limited to what little he had 
read of the history of the period. 
But he had read enough to know 
that when he and his Girl Saturday 
got there — assuming they got 
there — the new problems that 
would confront them would be 
nearly as bad as the ones con- 
fronting them now. 

Well, at least they would be dif- 
ferent. 

Coal Bin at last got the torch 
going, adjusted the flame and began 
applying it to the starboard door 
handle. 

“Ro-bin, the wall is getting hot,” 
Manijeh said. “I think we had bet- 
ter leave.” 

“We’re going to, Manijeh — but 
by a different door.” 

He began backing the raft toward 
the nearest section of the field- 
fence. Coal Bin and his friends con- 
fident their quarry couldn’t escape. 



150 



GALAXY 




walked easily along on either side 
of it. Coal Bin continued to apply 
the torch to the starboard door- 
handle, smiling at every other step. 

Several feet from the fence Robin 
braked, then inched the raft back- 
ward till the aft equilator-bar came 
into contact with the magnetic 
field. 

There was a loud pfft... as the 
energy transfer began. 

The “Buccannibillies” were vis- 
ibly startled, but none of them — not 
even Coal Bin — caught on. 

Not that it would have done them 
any good if they had. 

Robin kept his eyes focused on 
the time-drive energizer indicator. 
It climbed rapidly. When it com- 
pleted the circuit of the dial he 
turned off the launching motor. 

“Here we go!” he said to his Girl 
Saturday and threw the ganglion 
switch. 

AT FIRST nothing happened. 
XJL Then, subtly, the figures out- 
side the raft began to lose 
substance. So did Hill 29. So did 
Minos. So did MacDougall’s. So 
did Yasnaya Polvana. So did King 
Arthur’s Kingdom. Everyone and 
everything, in short — except Robin, 
Manijeh, the raft, the cars and the 
car lot — began to fade away. 

Suddenly the cars that Robin had 
torn down for parts reappeared. He 
kept his fingers crossed. Now, if 
ever, the raft would dematerialize 
and he and Manijeh would be left 
sitting on thin air. When it did not 



he knew that time was more lenient 
than he had thought — it could and 
did permit the coexistence of two or 
more versions of the same object. 

Buildings patterned with tiers of 
lighted windows had begun to take 
shape. Now people began to ap- 
pear. Muffled traffic noises reached 
his and Manijeh’s ears. 

At length the Buccannibillies 
vanished altogether. So did the 
ISLE. 

“Something is burning, Ro-bin,” 
Manijeh said. “Do you not smell it 
also?” 

It was the time-drive energizer, of 
course — or what was left of it. He 
rolled down the port window. 

“It’s nothing to be alarmed 
about, Manijeh.” 

He looked at the people standing 
in the lot, at the people passing in 
the street, on foot and in cars. 

Well, here we are, he thought. 
Babes in the late twentieth-century 
woods... 

He removed his jacket and told 
Manijeh to put it on before 
someone saw her jewels and tried to 
steal them. 

“Where are we, Ro-bin?” she 
asked. “Certainly this is not 
Sardis — or even Lydia.” 

“We’re in a strange country, Ma- 
nijeh — a country filled with fierce 
savages. But don’t worry. Most of 
them won’t attack us — at least not 
openly — because they like to 
pretend they’re civilized.” 

“I’m not worried. I am with 
you.”

Him? A fat lot of good he could 
do her. No job. No money in his 
pocket. She had sure picked a good 
one to pin her hopes on when she 
picked him! 

Most of the people in the lot were 
looking at the used cars. Presently 
one of the ones who wasn’t — a big 
beefy man with salt-and-pepper 
sideburns — noticed the raft for the 
first time. His eyes got as big as 
beer coasters. He came over and 
rested his elbow on the port window 
sill 

“Hi, folks — didn’t happen to see 
you drive in. Thinking of trading 
her in?” 

“Trading who in? Robin asked. 

“I’ll make you a generous 
allowance. After all, that’s how I 
got my name.” 

It got through to Robin finally 
that the man was referring to the 
time raft. 

“You drive out of here in one of 
my later models and I’ll go as high 
as two thousand bucks,” Generous 
George - continued. “And believe 
me, that’s tops for an old crate that 
needs a paint job as bad as this one. 
What make is it, by the way?” 

Robin stared at him. Two thou- 
sand dollars for a burned-out time 
raft? 

“I asked you —what make is it?” 
Generous George repeated. 

“I made it myself,” Robin said. 

“G’wan — ” 

During the conversation, another 
twentieth-centuryite character — a 
tall middle-aged man wearing a 



sleek blue business suit — had been 
walking around the raft, looking at 
it from this angle and that. Now, 
apparently having overheard 
Robin’s last words, he came over to 
the port window and asked, “You 
built this yourself?” 

Obviously awed. Generous 
George retired hastily into the 
background. 

“Well not exactly,” Robin 
amended. “I had a helper.” 

“How many horse?” 
“Four-twenty.” 

The tall man blinked. Then: 
“You must be polluting the envi- 
ronment like crazy. How the devil 
do you get away with it?” 

“I don’t get away with it. I in- 
stalled a simple afterburner that 
eliminates pollution entirely.” 

“I suppose you built that too.” 
“Naturally. Like to take a look 
at it?” 

“I haven’t time right now,” the 
tall man said. He handed Robin a 
card. “I’m staying at the 
Wenceslaus Arms across the 
street — that’s how I happened to 
get my eye on this job. Drop in 
tomorrow morning and we’ll have a 
chat. Maybe you’re pulling my leg 
and maybe you’re not — we’ll see. If 
you’re not and you can design a car 
for us like this one and si- 
multaneously free us from the 
Curse of the Wankel — our 
engineering department is shortly 
going to grow a new head.” 

The tall man turned and left the 
lot.

R OBIN felt a little better, but 
- not much. He had a good 
prospect of getting a job, but he still 
didn’t have any money. Down the 
street from the hotel he could see 
the lighted show-window of what 
undoubtedly was a pawnshop. If 
only. 

Scandalized, he threw the nascent 
thought out of his mind. What in 
the world was the matter with him? 
Had he no pride left at all? Besides, 
Manijeh would never go along with 
the idea — never in a million years. 

He became aware that she was 
looking at him intently. “Have you 
ever visited this strange land before, 
Ro-bin?’’ she asked. 

“No. But I know a little bit about 
it.” 

“One time when I was a little girl 
I became lost in a strange part of 
Sardis. No one would give me 
anything to eat nor would anyone 
offer me a place to sleep. A long 
time later I found out why.” 

He felt her hand touch his, felt 
something cold drop into his palm. 
Looking down, he saw the gleam of 
an emerald earring. 

“When I said all you wanted was 
my jewels,” Manijeh went on, “I 
said it because I thought you were 
still going to take me to Sardis and 
I was angry. I know that you do not 
want them — that you never did. I 
know also that you are not really a 
Mysian goatherd, but I think that 
you may be as poor as one. It is im- 
perative therefore that you ex- 
change this bauble for whatever is 



needed to obtain for us food and 
shelter and clothing.” 

“Now see here — ” Robin began. 
“But even though you may not be 
a Mysian goatherd,” Manijeh 
continued, “your apparel makes 
you look like one and it would 
never do for the daughter of King 
Croesus to be seen in the company 
of so uncouth a creature, especially 
when the means for him to alter his 
appearance are available.” 

“All right, I will exchange it,” 
Robin said and jammed the earring 
into his pocket. 

Then he saw that she was still 
looking at him, that there was a 
twinkle in her amber eyes. 

Was it possible that this Girl 
Saturday knew him even better 
than he knew her? 

“Suppose I really were a Mysian 
goatherd,” he said. “Suppose I 
couldn’t alter my appearance. 
What would the daughter of King 
Croesus’ reaction be to that?” 

“Way down in her heart she 
wouldn’t care a fig.” 

His Girl Saturday moved closer 
to him on the seat — so close that 
her hair touched his cheek. He put 
his arm around her and drove out 
into the twentieth-century night. It 
was spring and the streetlights 
shone softly on the sidewalks and 
the stores. A breeze born of fields 
and flowers was blowing up from 
the south. 

The good old Feeney luck, it 
would seem, had taken a turn for 
the better. ★

PHILIP LATHAM 

D AGNY’S policy for romance 
in married love was as decep- 
tively simple (and successful) as the 
Bank of England’s policy in fi- 
nance: Never apologize. Never 

explain. As Bob (Dr. Robert 
Archer) had discovered long ago, 
verbal combat with his wife was 
simply energy wasted upon the 



suburban air. How could she 
explain something to him when she 
couldn’t explain it tb herself? 
Equally futile was his trying to 
withhold a secret. Given sufficient 
time she would always know. And 
Dagny had worlds of time. 

It was early evening when Bob fi- 
nally pulled in to his driveway. 
Dagny was feeding Margarit, their 
ginger cat. The two identified 
in many respects. They functioned 
by intuition, a means of per- 
ception much superior to ratioci- 
nation. Raising the lid on a tin of 
catfood, or opening a carton of 
milk, caused Margarit to ma- 
terialize — sometimes, it seemed, 
from thin air. 

Usually Bob was able to make 
the two hundred miles from Mount 
Elsinore by late afternoon. But the 
unexpected arrival of a Nobel prize 
winner at the observatory and the 
subsequent time required for Bob’s 
plates to dry, had delayed him. The 
Nobel prize winner he had 
managed finally to brush off. But 
his plates had been a different mat- 
ter — he didn’t like forced drying. 
Furthermore, he hadn’t wanted 
anyone fooling with those 
particular plates but himself. 

But at last — after twelve con- 
secutive days and nights of ex- 
clusively masculine company on 
Mt. Elsinore — he was free and dirty 
and glad to see Dagny. Especially 
glad. 

She deserted Margarit and 
followed him upstairs while he was 



having a shower and shave. Upon 
emerging from the bathroom he 
found her examining a slip of 
yellow paper in his record book. 

Suddenly she exclaimed. “Dia- 
bolique!’’ 

Dagny was native Russian but 
had moved early to Paris, where she 
had appeared professionally on the 
stage. Bob read French and could 
understand and speak it fairly well. 
This time she might as well have 
spoken in Russian, which he under- 
stood not at all. He leaped at her, 
snatched the paper from her 
nerveless grasp. 

“Oh, god!’’ he cried. “To think 
you should have seen!” 

“And why should I not have?” 
“Because this is top secret — ” 
“So, scientists also have their 
secrets?” 

Dagny, in her capacity as Official 
Witch of California, often received 
cryptic messages from fellow 
mystics. Occasionally it had been 
Bob’s misfortune to have to take 
such calls. He faithfully recorded 
them, read them back, then passed 
the nonsense on to his wife without 
comment. He knew he could expect 
no reciprocity. 

He stuffed the paper into his 
dressing gown. “Who said this was 
science?” 

“What is it, then?” 

He averted his face, scowling 
darkly. “Interpol. Mafia. Eskimo 
connection in Greenland.” 

“Robert, you are in danger?” 

“It’s nothing-— nothing.”

“They threaten you?” 

Robert shrugged. To girls who 
liked him he was Robert, never 
Bob. 

“I shall bewitch them,” Dagny 
declared. “Destroy them with the 
blood of a lamb.” 

“Be kind of difficult, wouldn’t it? 
Seeing you’re a vegetarian.” 
“Perhaps a black turnip — ” 

Bob did a sudden changeover. 
His secret had to come out. 

“Darling, forget the lamb’s blood 
and the turnip. I might as well tell 
you — you’ve just discovered a new 
comet. Comet Dagny. This 
message is just the regular 
astronomical code for announcing a 
new object’s position. 

He smoothed out the crumpled 
yellow sheet.

Dagny was completely bewil- 
dered. 

“I discovered a comet? But who 
said so—” 

Bob tapped his chest. 

“I said. Moi. Me. That 
guarantees it will bear your name.” 
“You found it and named it for 
me? But how wonderful!” 

Bob shook his head regretfully. 
“Sorry, darling, but discovering a 
new comet doesn’t amount to 
much. Anybody can find one — just 
by looking long enough.” 



“I still think it’s wonderful.” 

“I didn’t really discover it. Found 
it purely by accident. Thought I’d 
take a look at Mercury. Been 
several reports of conspicuous 
markings on the terminator. While 
we were getting set I spotted this 
fuzzy object. Looked suspicious. 
Managed to get a couple of plates 
before sunrise. No doubt about it — 
comet all right.” 

“Comet Dagny?” 

Bob smiled wistfully. 

“Other men give their wives and 
girl friends mink coats and 
diamonds. Me? Best I can do is a 
comet.” 

“My comet? We can see it?” 
“Don’t know. Probably not.” 

Bob opened his record book and 
did some rapid figuring. 

“Hm — might at that. If my 
preliminary orbit’s any good — 
which it probably isn’t — this thing’s 
pretty bright for an object beyond 
Mars. Ought to be down around 
magnitude sixteen by sixth power 
law. I’d say it’s thirteen easy.” 

He took some dozen five-by- 
seven plates from his suitcase, each 
plate enclosed in a heavy manila en- 
velope. He arranged them in 
chronological order, then stowed 
them away in his bottom dresser 
drawer. 

“Comet Dagny,” he said with 
some satisfaction, “safe and secure 
with my socks and shorts.” 

“But in the sky?” 

“Somewhere in Aquarius the 
Waterbearer, I think. Mean

anything in your astrology?” 

Although Dagny had. had no 
formal training in astronomy, from 
astrology she had learned the 
meaning of such elementary terms 
as right ascension and declination, 
hour angle, ecliptic, node, 
perihelion, etc. 

She thought a moment before 
answering. 

“I’d have to know where it’s 
going first.” 

“General direction of Earth right 
now,” he said carelessly. 

He slipped into his bathrobe. 

“Ah, does this old room look 
good,” he sighed. “After that pad 
on the mountain.” Then, at sight of 
Dagny’s face: “Hey, what’s the 
matter?” 

Suddenly the light dawned. 

“Oh, lord. I’ll bet you’ve been 
seeing science-fiction films again! 
Don’t you know that in popular 
science every comet, asteroid or 
thing-from-outside is inevitably 
heading straight for the Earth? Ob- 
ject coming closer. Situation 
growing desperate. President calls 
emergency cabinet meeting. 
Secretary of Education and Indian 
Affairs goes on TV. Keep calm. 
Have faith. Government has situa- 
tion well in hand.” 

Dagny looked doubtful. 

“Oh, hell, why did I ever mention 
it?” he muttered impatiently. He 
turned to a sheet in his record book. 
“See this sketch? The comet’s path 
based on my parabolic orbit. N 
marks the ascending node. Circle’s 



the Earth. You can see there’s no 
chance of collision.” 

He fell back on the bed. 

“For two weeks I’ve been 
working my head off on that damn 
mountain. Worst part about that 
clean ascetic life is you get to 
feeling so good. So good sometimes 
you can hardly stand it.” 

He drew Dagny down beside him. 
“There’s a comjunction coming 
up all right,” he told her. “But not 
with any comet.” 

D AGNY was a witch. If you 
had asked her she would have 
said so in the same matter-of-fact 
way she might have admitted to 
being a librarian or registered 
nurse. There was no secret about it. 
After her appointment as Official 
State Witch, of course, no secret 
was possible. 

Bob and Dagny were “sexually 
compatible” and otherwise “mu- 
tually well adjusted,” as the 
marriage counselors euphemis- 
tically phrase it. On one point, 
however, they differed profoundly. 
Bob was a professional astronomer, 
a man devoted to what he could ob- 
serve and measure. As he was 
fond of pointing out: no theory can 
ever explain. At most it can only 
describe .* Bob was also a romantic, 
but a romantic with both feet on the 
ground.

1916), believed scientists must exclude ele-

Dagny, on the other hand, was a 
mystic, a believer in astrology, 
parapsychology and occultism. 
Strangely enough, there had never 
been any problem. Long ago they 
had taken a solemn vow to respect 
each other’s opinions. Bob shrug- 
ged off Dagny’s mysticism. Dagny 
accepted Bob’s forthright prag- 
matism. It was that simple. 

Then, too, there was the very spe- 
cial nature of Dagny’s witchcraft. 
She had nothing but scorn for the 
famous witches of old. Their 
powers were feeble, confined princi- 
pally to graveyards and unrentable 
houses. Who ever heard of Medea 
beyond the Aegean Sea? Had 
Morgan Le Fey ever made the 
headlines in Hindustan? 

Dagny maintained that witch- 
craft — truly valid witchcraft — 
had no bounds. The speed 
of light is finite — that of thought, 
infinite. Hence witchcraft, if 
good in Haiti, should likewise be 
good in New York, on Mars or in 
the Andromeda galaxy, it made no 
difference. She agreed with Conan 
Doyle that “A devil with merely 
local powers like a parish vestry 
would be too inconceivable a 
thing .” 2 

Certain practical expressions of 
Dagny’s prowess as a witch had to 
do with the fact that she had never 
stopped acting. It was the fragile 
“Marguerite Gautier,” The Lady 
of The Camelias, who beguiled the

butcher into giving her an extra 
choice cut of steak. It was “Lady 
Macbeth” who prodded the land- 
lord into repairing the roof. 

Occasionally she took part in 
some little theater production in 
their neighborhood. Bob wished she 
wouldn’t. Her “Laura” in 
Strindberg’s The Father had made 
“Martha” in Who’s Afraid of Vir- 
ginia Woolf? look like a Sunday- 
school teacher at a wienie bake. 

B OB knew his preliminary para- 
bolic orbit would be useless for 
prediction after a few weeks. But to 
improve the orbit he had to extend 
the arc. And to extend the arc he 
needed additional observations. 

To those unfamiliar with the 
operation of a large observatory 
this would seem easy enough. Just 
take the telescope and get them. 
But the observing time of a large 
telescope is jealously guarded, care- 
fully rationed out to the various 
staff members according to their 
special needs, weeks in advance. 
Bob was all too well aware of the 
futility of requesting observing time 
for such an insignificant object as a 
comet. His only hope of getting 
more plates was to find some big- 
hearted individual who would 
squeeze him in for a few minutes. 
Bob had done such favors for others 
often enough. But he was forced to 
go from office to office as a sup- 
pliant, begging for that precious in- 
tangible quantity known as time. 
“Be glad to oblige, but — ” 



160 



GALAXY 




“Sure sorry, Bob, but — ” 

“Remember how you. saved m>y 
life once, but — ” 

Others simply shook their head* 
or gave him a stony stare. 

Of course, Mt. Elsinore was not 
the only possibility. Bob’s wire to 
the Central Bureau for Astron- 
omical Telegrams, Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, had been broad- 
cast to observatories all over 
the world. His comet was so 
near the sun, however, and so cor- 
respondingly difficult to observe 
that he doubted if any astronomers 
would care to make the effort. 
Time went on and on until Bob was 
forced to write Comet Dagny off as 
lost. 3 

Then, one morning, wholly unex- 
pected good news came in the form 
of a hand- written letter from his old 
professor of Celestial Mechanics, 
Dr. William P. Killigrew, Director 
of the Killigrew Observatory, 
Dunedin, New Zealand. Not only 
was Dr. Killigrew the director of 
the institution that bore his name — 
he was also its entire observing 
staff, chief of public relations, 
science head and janitor. Its 12- 
inch Schmidt photographic being 
his own personal property, he could 
use it however and whenever he 
chose. The result was a dozen per- 
fectly good positions of Comet 



(3) The Astronomical Society of the Pacific 
annually awards a gold medal to each dis- 

coverer of an unexpected comet. Ironically, 
the A.S.P. ran out of funds for gold medals 
the month Bob discovered Comet Dagny. 



Dagny extending the arc over 
another two months. 

The new positions wrought some 
radical surgery on the orbit of 
Comet Dagny. The parabola was 
forced into a closed ellipse of or- 
bital period 3.375 years, the 
shortest of any comet except 
Encke’s. 4 A close brush with 
Jupiter had effected the shift. 

Comet Dagny still missed Earth 
by a wide margin at the ascending 
node, N, where it “surfaced” from 
below to above the Earth’s orbital 
plane. Bob had not earlier been 
much concerned about N’, where 
Dagny ducked underground again. 
Now it was a jolt to him to discover 
that N’ fell precisely on the Earth’s 
orbit. 

This fact alone, of course, did not 
mean that Earth and comet were 
doomed to collide. To collide, both 
bodies must arrive at N' si- 
multaneously, a most improbable 
event. Yet a hurried calculation 
showed the comet had an excellent 
chance of scoring a hit. 

Should he tell Dagny? He was 
undecided. He felt the truth never 
hurt anyone. And Dagny was not 
easily alarmed. The other side of 
the coin had to do with a direct 
blow to his ego — after his caustic 
remarks anent popular science 
writings and cosmic collisions. 
Furthermore, should the comet

period of 2.31 years, but it has been observed 
at one appearance only and its orbit not well 
determined.

miss — as it doubtless would by a 
small margin — he would have 
himself look ridiculous a second 
time. But ego satisfaction should 
have no place in science. 

Then he got another idea. 

F EW places on Earth can boast 
of such quick scenic changes as 
the great and tangled network of 
highways in southern California. 
Keeping an eye on one’s sur- 
roundings while driving through is 
like watching a revolving stage. 
Start from the Los Angeles city 
hall. Head north toward the moun- 
tains. At the foothills follow the 
white line leading to Mt. Elsinore 
and at about 4000 feet park at some 
convenient wide turnout. Now you 
are in another world. 

The time? Nine o’clock on a cool 
clear evening in October. 

“Suppose we use that rock as our 
base of operations,’’ Bob said, 
opening the car door. “You go sit 
down. I’ll bring the lunch basket 
and blanket.” 

He waited until Dagny had 
reached the rock, then switched off 
the lights and stumbled after her. 
Dagny began scanning the sky im- 
mediately. Bob was more interested 
in the lunch basket. 

Dagny was frankly disappointed. 
“The comet, it is there?” 

“Some place in Aquarius — its 
got to be.” He came up with a 
couple of sandwiches. “Which 
would you rather have— cheese or 
tuna?” 



“I see it!” Dagny cried. She grab- 
bed Bob’s arm. “There — over that 
pine tree.” 

Bob followed her gaze. The stars 
of Aquarius are faint and form no 
easily recognizable pattern. Bob, 
like most professional astronomers, 
was familiar only with the brighter 
constellations. 

“That’s her all right. Comet 
Dagny, a new female in the sky, 
along with Cassiopeia and Virgo 
and Queen Berenices’ Hair.” 

Detail began coming out in the 
newcomer as their night vision 
sharpened. Bob found Dagny’s 
hand under the laprobe. He 
wondered — how many men since 
the world began could boast of such 
an experience? The woman he loved 
the most by his side and her coun- 
terpart in the sky. 

The comet did not correspond to 
the popular image of a comet, a 
hairy star with a beautiful long 
streaming tail. Instead it was an 
elongated blob with a stubby tail 
like a manx cat. 

“It has no tail,” said Dagny, 
disappointed. 

“Sure it has. Sticking out behind 
it away from the sun.” He scru- 
tinized the celestial Dagny with a 
critical eye. “Wish there were a nice 
sharp nucleus in that big white 
coma. Makes it hard to get ac- 
curate positions.” 

“White?” Dagny asked. “Looks 
pale green to me, like something 
from the sea.” 

Bob turned his head slightly. 



162

trying to glimpse the comet by 
averted vision. 

“It is pale greenish, isn’t it? 
Probably emission from the Swan 5 
bands of carbon. The C 2 molecule 
emits all through the spectrum, 
especially strong in the green.” He 
chuckled. “Reason why women 
find candlelight so flattering. 
Emission from the Swan bands.” 
They watched the comet until it 
began to merge with the branches 
of a pine. Dagny drew the laprobe 
closer. A chill wind was coming up 
from the west. 

“Maybe we’d better be going,” 
said Bob. “Must be getting on 
toward midnight.” 

They returned to the car. Bob 
drove carefully, as if lost in 
thought, his eyes fixed on the white 
line winding ahead. 

“Imagine,” said Dagny, “people 
fearing anything so beautiful.” 

Bob did not reply. 

P PREDICTED instant of peri- 
helion passage for Comet 
Dagny was 1974, Tuesday, March 
19d 13h 13m 47s UT = J.D. 
2442126.05124. Perihelion passage 
is a critical date for astronomers — 
it serves as a check on their calcula- 
tions. Bob grew increasingly 
restless and abstracted with its ap- 
proach. Not that anything particu- 
larly spectacular was expected: 



(5) Named after Sir Joseph Wilson Swan 
(1828-1914), who first described this series 
of bands from violet to red. The nature of 
the emitting molecule was long in doubt. 



Comet Dagny was not a sungrazer 
like Ikeya-Seki of 1965, although it 
very probably would be visible in 
full daylight. Perihelion occurred as 
anticipated and was widely 
recorded. 

By April Bob was going around 
in a daze. So completely had he 
identified with the comet that it had 
become more real than the world 
around him. Dagny appeared not to 
notice. She did not complain. She 
did not comment. She asked no 
questions. She had undergone such 
ordeals before. They always passed. 

Then came a rainy evening in 
early April when Bob found his wife 
completely transformed. Gone was 
the quiet creature lolling on the 
chaise longue by the fireside. Dagny 
made a point of always dressing for 
dinner^ She cared nothing for 
fashion. Her taste ran to the thin 
transparent white Empire style 
gown of the early 1800s. Bob was 
scarcely past the door before she 
swung him around the room, her 
eyes shining, her voice husky, se- 
ductive: 

The little apples man entice 
Since first they were in 
Paradise. 

I feel myself with pleasure glow 
That such within my garden 
grow. 

He was not as startled as might 
have been supposed. He had 
experience with Dagny’s moods. 

“Hey, let me get my coat off,” he

163 




mumbled, trying to break loose. 
“I’m all wet.” 

Dagny fell back on the chaise, 
gasping and laughing. Bob mixed 
himself a drink and perched on, the 
other end. 

“Why all the merriment?” he in- 
quired. 

Dagny poured it out. 

She had received an invitation 
from the International Grand 
Coven to attend its annual meeting 
during the last half of April in 
Bucharest. Owing to the rising 
interest in occultism, the IGC for 
the first time in its stormy history 
had wound up the year with a sub- 
stantial surplus in its treasury. A 
special tour of Transylvania, the 
Dracula country, had been ar- 
ranged. Grand climax was to be a 
performance of the Walpurgis 
Night scene from Faust, with 
Dagny playing Lilith, young witch 
“fair beyond compare.” 

“It’s to be a real professional 
production with exotic costumes 
and special lighting effects,” she 
ran on, unable to restrain her en- 
thusiasm. “And guess what? 
They’re paying all our expenses!” 

“Sounds wonderful,” Bob 
agreed, regarding his empty glass. 
“Sorry to be so late. Began raining 
and the windshield wiper wouldn’t 
work.” 

Dagny surveyed him steadily. 

“So it started to rain? And the 
windshield wiper wouldn’t work?” 
Her eyes never left his face. “That 
is all you have to say?” 



“I said it was wonderful.” 
“Nothing else?” 

“I’m very happy for you.” 
“Robert.” 

“Yes?” 

“What is wrong?” 

“Wrong? Nothing’s wrong.” 

“Oh, I have known for months. 
Ever since that night on the moun- 
tain.” 

B OB had thought his wife could 
no longer surprise him. Now 
he had some doubts. There was an 
elegance about her at this moment, 
that compelling elegance* which 
comes to some women after thirty 
and is bom of absolute assurance in 
their poise and beauty. 

“Madame Recamier,” he said, 
grinning feebly. 

He tried to turn away but her 
eyes refused to let him go. She had 
learned the art of catching the at- 
tention of an audience and holding 
it to some purpose, it seemed. 

“Lose your slippers?” he said, 
glancing around the floor. “Your 
feet are bare.” 

“So were Madame Rlcamier’s.” 
“That so? I never noticed.” 
“Robert, what is wrong?” 

Bob reached for his glass. 

“No!” 

There was a long silence. Two 
minutes can be a long silence. 

“This Grand Coven meeting,” he 
began, “suppose it didn’t happen.” 
“But I have the letter.” 

“I didn’t mean that.” 

“No? What did you mean?” 



164 



GALAXY 




“I meant — well, things occur 
that you can’t control.” He stood 
for several minutes, feet apart, head 
bowed. Suddenly he looked at her 
again. ‘‘Comet Dagny will strike 
the Earth. No doubt about it. Point 
of contact near Hawaiian Islands. 
Epoch is 23h 19m UT of May 2 1 .” 
“But that’s after the meeting,” 
said Dagny. 

Bob stared. 

“You mean you’d go ahead with 
this witchcraft thing? With such a 
menace from outer space on the 
way? It’s a big comet. No telling 
what may happen. Thousands — 
millions of people may die.” 

Dagny shrugged. 

Bob was listening intently. He 
strode to one of the windows, cup- 
ping his hands against the glass. 

“Come outside. Something I 
want you to see.” 

Then when she failed to stir: 
“Well, move!” he shouted. “Quick! 
Vite! Stat!” 

They stepped out to the porte- 
cochere. The rain had stopped. The 
stars were dancing in the darkening 
sky. Bob seized Dagny by the 
shoulders and whirled her around 
to face a red glow low in the west. 

“See that?” he demanded. 
“That’s Comet Dagny.” 

“But Comet Dagny is green.” 
“Red now,” he said gently. 

They reentered the house. Bob 
threw another log on the fire. 
Dagny leaned back on the chaise 
longue absently stroking Margarit. 
“Why red?” she asked. 



“Hard to explain in a few 
words,” Bob said. “Comet’s so 
much nearer the sun than when 
we saw it last October. Gases in 
the coma get so hot the molecules 
are torn apart into atoms. And 
oxygen atoms, for instance, emit 
red rays not ordinarily observable. 
‘Forbidden’ rays we call them.” 

“ ‘Forbidden?’ ” asked Dagny. 
“ Tabou ?” 

“Not absolutely forbidden. 
Rather — just highly improbable, 
let’s say. So improbable that ordi- 
narily we never see them.” Bob 
hesitated, trying to think of a good 
analogy. “You might compare the 
oxygen atoms to a guy in a busy of- 
fice trying to write a tough report. 
He can’t get started because he’s al- 
ways being interrupted. So he 
switches to the graveyard shift. 
Now — no visitors or phone calls. 
He works straight through. Same 
principle applies to the oxygen 
atoms out in the vacuum of space. 
They’re undisturbed and able to 
emit the red rays ordinarily too 
feeble to be observed.” He smiled 
wryly. “Nice symbolism too. First 
comet’s green — safety. Red now — 
DANGER AHEAD.” 

T HEY sat for a long time gazing 
into the flames. Only Margarit 
kept on busily with her elaborate 
washing ritual. 

Dagny spoke first. 

“You said collision was im- 
possible?” 

“I said too much,” Bob admitted. 



FUTURE FORBIDDEN 



165 




“That was way back in the 
Palaeozoic and was based on my 
parabolic orbit. Entirely new heresy 
now. Here, let me show you.” He 
went to his overcoat, extracted a 
roll of paper which he spread out 
between them. “This oval’s the 
orbit of Comet Dagny. Circle’s the 
Earth’s orbit, with Earth like a 
marble rolling around on top. The 
broken line shows where comet is 
moving below the Earth’s orbit. 
Smooth line is where comet is 
moving above. This point, N, is the 
ascending node, where comet ‘sur- 
faces,’ or moves from below to 
above plane of the Earth’s orbit. 
Way off from Earth’s orbit. 
Couldn’t possibly have a collision. 
But look here at N\ the 
descending node, where the comet 
dives under again. Falls smack on 
Earth’s path. Dammit, never car- 
ried my preliminary orbit far as 
descending node.” 

He gazed morosely at the of- 
fending point, TV'. 

“Of course, can’t be a collision 
unless comet and Earth reach N' 
together. Highly improbable situa- 
tion. But as it happens they will 
meet — right to the second. Like 
that traffic light I always hit on 
red.” 

Such a one-in-a-million chance 
apparently didn’t strike Dagny as 
so remarkable — she was familiar 
with the traffic light Bob had men- 
tioned. 

“Peut-etre que oui she mur- 
mured. 



“Oh, we’ll survive it,” Bob 
assured her. “More crackpot ideas 
floating around! One they’re 
pushing the hardest is a comet 
intercept probe. Looks pretty 
promising. We launch a rocket 
equipped with a thermonuclear 
warhead, probably some time in 
April. We’ve already got the 
necessary instrumentation. The 
rocket zeros in on the comet. No 
chance for a miss. We give the com- 
mand, warhead detonates, and 
comet’s destroyed in a mass of 
bomb plasma.” 

“Comet Dagny — destroyed?” 
“Afraid so. Arguments in favor 
are pretty strong. Nothing in- 
volved we haven’t done before. 
They estimate Fifty pounds of 
contaminant — ” 

“Never!” 

Gone was the languid Madame 
Re'eamier. In her place was a de- 
fiant, imperious Saint Joan. 

“Well, I’m resisting it,” Bob 
hastened to add. “But then, hell, 
who ever listens to me?” 

“It is I, Dagny, Official Witch of 
California, who speaks,” she 
declared. “This collision is forbid- 
den.” 

In previous crises Bob had dis- 
covered an attitude of passive 
nonopposition brought the best 
results. This time, however, he felt 
compelled to remonstrate. 

“Remember, this orbit isn’t any 
of my scribbling. It’s based on data 
fed into a CDC 6600 computer with 
an n-body code. We took every 



166 



GALAXY 




possible gravitational force into ac- 
count. Always with the same 
result — collision.” 

“No!” 

“You still persist?” 

Dagny replied with superb 
assurance, “Yes. In spite of 
everything.” 

Days passed. 

The comet came on. 

B OB took his coffee upstairs to 
watch the launching. Dagny 
refused to witness the disgraceful 
spectacle. Aside from giving Mar- 
garit an extra helping of gourmet 
cat food at twenty cents per fifteen- 
ounce can, she went about her 
household tasks exactly as usual. 

“Well, perfect launching,” Bob 
announced, joining Dagny at the 
breakfast table. “Funny thing,” he 
remarked reflectively. “Folks have 
been scared of comets for centuries. 
First time we ever took a shot at 
one.” 

Dagny did not appear amused. 
Bob decided not to press the sub- 
ject. He glanced through the paper. 
Along with dire predictions should 
the mission fail, there was the usual 
routine list of floods, murders, 
hijackings, etc. Considerable space 
was devoted to a new outbreak of 
Exotic Newcastle disease, which 
threatened to double the price of 
eggs. (Associated in some obscure 
way with the onset of the comet.) 

He laid aside the paper, poured 
more coffee, was about to comment 
on some household chore, then de- 



cided this was a situation de- 
manding the direct approach. He 
went to his wife, put his arms 
around her, and kissed her. It was 
not a peck. It was a kiss. 

“Don’t take it so hard. Periodic 
comets generally peter out after a 
while. How much better a heroic 
end than a slow lingering death. 
Think! Comet Dagny will be a 
landmark in astronomy. Re- 
membered in the annals of science 
as long as science itself.” 

Such intimations of immortality 
gave no consolation. As remarked 
earlier, Dagny already had worlds 
of time. 



S LOW fade to ten-second 
blackout during Bob’s last im- 
passioned outburst. Lights up re- 
vealing a nation, in home and cock- 
tail bar, immobile, spellbound, 
awaiting the moment of truth. An 
expectant hush hangs over all. Only 
occasionally is the silence broken 
by the pop of beer cans and crackle 
of potato chips. All eyes are fixed, 
center screen, on the gleaming 
cylinder, hanging virtually mo- 
tionless against the background of 
stars. 

Flashback to mission control. 
“The Space Intercept is now at 
rendezvous position with Comet 
Dagny.” 

But where was Comet Dagny? 
Millions of cubic AUs without a 
comet in sight. 

The Comet Intercept was in the

awkward situation of a rookie foot- 
ball player assigned to take out a 
certain opponent. He arrives at the 
designated position ready to carry 
out his assignment. Only his op- 
ponent isn’t there. What to do? 

Mission control after solemn de- 
liberation decided to fire the 
warhead anyhow. Slow fadeout on 
$20,000,000 of bomb plasm. 

Bob blamed it all on the stupid 
technologists in charge of opera- 
tions. Never did trust those guys. 
No imagination. Well, wait till 
May 21, the predicted date of 
collision. But the Earth passed the 
comet’s descending node without 
incident, not even a piffling little 
meteor shower. 6 

A few billion beings breathed 
easier. There was much celebrating 
in the streets. 

Soothsayers and the astrology- 
struck promptly began making fun 
of science and its predictions. 

E VENING of the day following 
the descending node. Dagny 
and Margarit reclining on the 
chaise before the fire. Bob restlessly 
pacing the room. 

“Not the first time a comet’s 
disappeared,” he muttered, “Good 
evidence some comets are affected 
by nongravitational forces — 
Honda-Mrkos-Pajdusakova — Giac 
obina-Zinner. ‘Erratics’ we call

station, Kodaikanal, India, reported an

them. But Comet Dagny’s the first 
one that ever pulled a vanishing act 
right in front of us.” 

“Is it really so important?” 
Dagny said, absently stroking 
Margarit. 

“It is to astronomers.” 

“But why?” 

“Because it violates all our es- 
tablished laws of motion, that’s 
why. Time and again we have ques- 
tioned Newton’s laws. Invariably 
the deviations have been traced to 
errors in observation or com- 
putation. 7 They survive the test of 
the experimental method. Not like 
astrology and that crap.” 

He flung himself on the chaise, 
his head in Dagny’s lap. 

“I’m sorry. Forgive me. Forgot 
our vow.” 

“You’re so agitated about how 
comets go,” Dagny said, after a 
pause. “Tell me, Robert, how do 
comets come?” 

Bob pulled himself together with 
a masterful effort. 

“That’s harder than telling a kid 
how babies come. Why, the stork 
brings them. They find them on a 
rose bush or cabbage plant. As for 
comets — ‘they come from the 
everywhere into here.’ ” 

He hesitated, trying to collect his 
scattered senses. 

“Well, seriously, explanation 
most in favor is Jan Oort’s comet 



(7) Bob, in his agitated state of mind, 
neglected the slight deviations due to general 
relativity.

cloud hypothesis. He postulates a 
spherical shell surrounding the 
solar system 30,000 to' 100,000 
astronomical units thick. Comets 
originate from condensations in 
shell. A comet starts creeping 
toward the solar system. After 
millions of years finally makes it. 
Whisks around the Sun and heads 
back into deep space. 

“Occasionally one like Comet 
Dagny has a close encounter with 
Jupiter. Poor thing’s trapped. Its 
becoming a short-period ellipse 
like an asteriod’s. All clear?” 

Bob relapsed into gloomy silence. 
Margarit yawned. 

“This comet cloud,” said Dagny, 
“it forms how?” 

“Easiest answer is by 
catastrophe. Body revolving 
between Mars and Jupiter blows 
up. Don’t ask me why. Part escapes 
to the stars. Part goes to form the 
comet cloud.” 

“You have observed it?” 

“Hell, no. We put it there.” 

“Ah, then you are like Mar- 
garit.” 

“Margarit?” Bob gave that 
ginger feline a suspicious glance. 
“How’d Margarit get into this?” 
“You think your comets come 
from this cloud. Margarit thinks 
her food comes from tin cans. 
Why? Somebody put it there.” 

Bob pondered. 

“Yeah, I get the point.” 
“Margarit sees me open a can. 
Out comes her food. She sees me 
open a cardboard carton. Out 



comes her milk. It always works. 
It’s a law that never fails. Of 
course,” Dagny said, “the 
creature’s viewpoint is rather 
limited.” 

“Yeah, so’s ours.” 

“I wonder,” Dagny mused, “how 
many of our other ideas on life and 
the universe are equally limited? 
We think we peer so deep. But who 
can say? If we peered deeper might 
not we find a wholly new universe, 
utterly mysterious and in- 
comprehensible?” 

“Dagny, do you peer deeper? Is 
that what you’re telling me?” 

“Most cats, even, peer deeper. 
They discover mice — and thus seem 
sorcerers to such felines as our 
Margarit.” 

Bob gravely addressed the slum- 
bering cat. 

“Margarit, some day you and I 
will have a long talk about that.” 
He rubbed her ear. She purred ap- 
preciatively. 

“Little witch, I did hear you ban 
the collision. But surely you’re not 
silly enough to. .” Her proud stare 
stopped him. He could guess her 
thoughts. Don’t apologize. Don’t 
explain. 

They both chuckled. 

Then his jaw set firmly. 

“But don’t get me wrong. I’m 
still sticking with my same old 
stodgy ideas. All I believe is what I 
can observe and measure.” 

“Quand me me?" 

He nodded. 

“In spite of everything.” ♦

Volume One 
Award, 95^ 



T’VE some big ones for you this 
time. Big to have and to hold, 
tall on the horizons of both sf and 
this still-new year. First and big- 
gest: The Science Fiction Hall of 
Fame, in not one, but two big beau- 
tiful volumes, each $9.95 — and 
before you wince at the price, look 
what your double sawbuck gets 
you: to quote the subtitle. The 
Greatest Science Fiction Novellas 
of All Time. They were selected by 
the membership of the Science Fic- 
tion Writers of America, whose 
ballots were counted and winnowed 
by Ben Bova. He found himself at 
last with an irreducible list of 23 
stories totalling over 400,000 
words — far too many to include in 
one volume. Doubleday generously 
(and, I think, wisely) agreed to 
make two books rather than at-

tempt to trim the list. And what a 
list! With somewhat agonizing 
restraint — the merest echo of what 
Bova and his Vol. 1 predecessor, 
Robert Silverberg, had to go 
through — I shall refrain from com- 
menting at all on these stories, but 
will merely list them with the 
observations that long-term sf ad- 
dicts must have this book, 
neophytes should have it, non-sf 
readers could hardly find a better 
introduction to the field and that no 
library worthy of the name should 
be without it. 

VOLUME TWO A 

Call Me Joe, Poul Anderson. 
Who Goes There? John Camp- 
bell. Nerves, Lester del Rey. 
Universe, Robert A.. Heinlein. 
The Marching Morons, C. M. 
Kornbluth. Vintage Season, 
Henry Kuttner and C. L. 
Moore (as Lawrence O’Don- 
nell). A Canticle for Leibowitz, 
Walter M. Miller, Jr. .And 
Then There Were None, Eric 
Frank Russell. The Ballad of 
Lost C’mell, Cordwainer 
Smith. The Time Machine, 
H. G. Wells. With Folded 
Hands, Jack Williamson. Baby 
is Three, Theodore Sturgeon. 

VOLUME TWO B 

The Martian Way, Isaac 
Asimov. Earthman, Come 



Home, James Blish. The 
Fireman, Ray Bradbury. The 
Spectre General, Theodore 
Cogswell. The Machine Stops, 
E. M. Forster. The Midas 
Plague, Frederik Pohl. The 
Witches of Karres, James H. 
Schmitz. E for Effort, T. L. 
Sherred. The Big Front Yard, 
Clifford D. Simak. The Moon 
Moth, Jack Vance. 

The earliest of these stories is the 
Wells; the latest, Cordwainer 
Smith’s — 1895 and 1962 respec- 
tively. The cost, at today’s prices, is 
approximately two packs of 
cigarettes per story. Quit smoking 
and buy the books. 

A NOTHER big one — 530 pages 
>• and 15 Fine stories, is The 
Astounding- Analog Reader, edited 
by Harry Harrison and Brian 
Aldiss — and it’s called Volume 
One. Just how soon we may expect 
the rest, editors and publishers say 
not. Soon, I hope. The Hall of 
Fame- books are largely a tribute to 
that extraordinary editor John W. 
Campbell, Jr.; the Reader is 
entirely so, as its introduction 
warmly states. Only one story from 
the Hall of Fame is duplicated 
here — Cordwainer Smith’s classic. 
Inevitably, some of the authors are, 
but with different stories and I 
heartily applaud the choices:

John Campbell himself, Asimov, 
Heinlein, Kuttner/Moore and 
Simak. In addition we have yarns 
by Gallun, Bates, P. Schuyler 
Miller, Ross Rocklyne, Bester, 
Leinster, Chandler, and Fredric 
Brown. The stories, most of them 
long ones, are arranged chronologi- 
cally in five sections and range from 
1932 to 1946, each section with its 
informative preface and yielding a 
most engrossing account of the 
growth and evolution of the 
magazine from its beginnings 
through the war years. A good 
choice for a basic library — and I 
shall keep you informed about the 
advent of the next volume. 

JOHN BRUNNER, a most 
^ competent writer indeed, never 
ceases to amaze. Now he has 
translated from the French 
Gerard Klein’s novel Les Seigneurs 
de la Guerre. The Overlords of War 
is many things — rather too many 
for me. It is space travel and time 
travel and swashbuckle, paradox 
and paradiddle and bakers’ bevies 
of naked girls who may or may not 
be for real. The protagonist Corson 
is sometimes aware of the forces 
which push him around and some- 
times not, and then again, in some 
other time-track, his truelove never 
existed at all except in his memory. 
I have seldom seen so much skin 
with so little sex. Brunner/ Klein 



writes smoothly enough. Lord 
knows, but one is forcefully 
reminded of Fletcher Pratt’s 
dictum on novelizing: “Your reader 
will willingly believe one un- 
believable thing. Don’t give him 
two!” A book like this illuminates 
the distinction between “amuse” 
and “bemuse.” I am in awe of 
Brunner’s ability with languages, 
but I would advise anyone with 
such talent never to translate a 
lesser writer than himself. 

W ITH The Phaeton Condition 
Douglas R. Mason climbs 
another step on the names-to-be- 
looked-for pyramid. He writes hard 
and glossy and fast and tight. 
Funny, too — English-slangy with 
that special vividness which pops up 
now and then from old Albion. 
Ecology is beginning to feel a little 
faddish by now (though I saw a 
bumper sticker not long ago: 
ecology: man’s last fad) and 
without knocking the subject I’m 
beginning to look for fresh variants. 
Scientifically there’s a critical 
booboo near the end — unless you 
can give me the address of a huge 
well of oxygen, stashed in the earth 
like natural gas — and, too, I find 
the win-every-round superboy a lit- 
tle unbelievable. And that ends the 
cavils. I had a good swift funny 
time reading this book and I want 
you to read it, too.

GALAXY 




S PEAKING of ecology and re- 
lated subjects (like: have we 
gone so far over the edge we just 
can’t get back?) Thomas Disch has 
given us a new selection of 
originals — stories, novelettes and 
poems — that at first blush would 
seem to be a downer. Bad Moon 
Rising has as its theme (to quote 
the blurb) “a concern for the 
present political scene and the 
dismal, or dismaying or downright 
terrifying direction in which it’s 
been drifting and/or hurtling 
during this last grim decade.” Yet a 
downer it is not — and all credit for 
this goes to Disch and his precise, 
compassionate sense of balance and 
taste. He is a good writer who 
knows good writing. One wonders 
how much of this volume he gigged, 
pressured, tickled and forced his 
writers to produce for him. Surely 
no anthologist could be so lucky as 
to find writers and writing like this 
under a cabbage leaf. Further, the 
contents spread and spill over the 
fences of conventional sf, a 
movement I always applaud. Such 
a spreading does not always suc- 
ceed as sf, art or literature — indeed, 
it may well fail more often than it 
succeeds — and that is, in evolu- 
tionary terms, a commonplace and 
more “natural” — more scientific, if 
you like — than drawing lines and 
driving pilings to inhibit growth and 
change. I have a personal fondness 



for living literature, which means 
the acceptance of growth and 
change. Disch’s approach is 
confluent with this and I refuse not 
to applaud, for example, Marilyn 
Hacker’s cry of pain at the death of 
Janis Joplin just because it leans 
over the fence. I know where its 
roots are and I’m proud of the soil. 
Bad Moon Rising will be one of 
those permanent possessions, to go 
with me wherever I go, to live on a 
shelf within reach. There are 
shockers in here that swirl and 
shake: Ellison, Silverberg, Disch 
himself; and poignancy as in two 
fragments by Effinger which 
reverently extend the narratives of a 
pair of your most treasured 
childrens’ stories. Gene Wolfe, 
Carol Emshwiller, Norman Rush, 
Kit Reed grab your shoulders, 
swing you around and say Look! 
Look! Look at what’s happening! 
Maybe you don’t want to look. If 
so, you are not really involved in 
speculative fiction, which of course 
is not my problem nor Disch’s, but 
yours. Anyway, get this good big 
living book. 

I must say a good happy grateful 
word for The Best from Galaxy, 
and say it for more reasons than 
loyalty to Our Favorite Magazine. 
It calls itself Volume One, and I 
hope it leads to a long series. These 
stories are chosen from the rich 
crop of 1969-71, and include

Let me share a joy with you: 
watching Robert Heinlein on the

that a page of my copy was

DIRECTIONS ( Cont. from page 4) 
Make Room! and Dune are not going 
to go down in history as any great 
literary wonders. Why? Not because 
they’re relevant ( though they attempt 
to be), but because they’re shoddy 
novels. And yet think of how many 
great books there are that were 
considered relevant in their time! 
Dickens’ Hard Times, the social satires 
of Jane Austen, Gulliver’s Travels, and 
so on, are all as well read (in fact, 
more so) as they were when written. 
Why? Because all these books touch 
universal chords in the reader. Heinlein 
does not. 

Mr. Higginbotham's letter is so true 
it’s frightening. If we as science fiction 
writers and readers strive in our 
literature for action without purpose, 
excitement without meaning, relevance 
without humanity, then sf not only de- 
serves the beratings it so often gets. 

This is not, of course, what Mr. Hig- 
ginbotham means. But it is what he 
says. What he means is that science fic- 
tion should be all pure adventure, 
without any trivialities such as 
“meaning” or “theme” or “sym- 
bolism” to tie it down. That’s like 
saying a jet should be all engines and no 
seats. 

But sf shouldn’t confine itself to 
being simply a literature of adventure. 
It is exactly that heritage that bogs it 
down, that keeps it from gaining the 
stature it deserves. Leave the straight- 
forward punchfests for those who never 
got over their father-fixations. The time 
is coming for science fiction to turn to 
the truths that matter to the rest of 
mankind. One only hopes they won't 
demand too many action sequences.
