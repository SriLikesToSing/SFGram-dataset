THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told— things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some— but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws— 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

THAT'S TWO VOTES 



A N Air Force major, writing 
from New Mexico, recently 
concluded his communique in this 
neighborly fashion: “I enjoy the 
magazine in spite of your edi- 
torials.’' Having done a bit of 
corresponding with him, I know 
he needed no Act of Congress to 
make him a gentleman — actually, 
he was born with a silver foot in 
his mouth — and was merely 
needling me. 

But you know something, 
Maje? That’s how I feel, too. 

Sometimes editorials are fun 
to do. Occasionally they’re an 
urgently needed safety valve. 
Now and then, of course, they 
are a burden to write and, I, sup- 
pose, to read, though those are 
the ones I revise most often and 
drastically. No matter which 
kind they are, though, I keep 
wondering what I, a devout en- 
tertainer, am doing writing what 
I refuse to call think-pieces, 
though they are. 

So, Maje, far from needling 
me, you’ve found a probably un- 
expected ally. 

Maybe it’s just that this 
month’s ideas won’t shape up. 
Let’s see what you would do with 
them. 

One of our writers reported 



trudging up the subway stairs 
behind two men and heard the 
first exclaim, “God’s sakes! We 
get on uptown and the Sun’s out. 
We get down here and it’s pour- 
ing!” The second man' said, 
“Well, it’s better than nothing.” 
I’ve been puzzling over that 
reply for months. Had he only 
produced a reflex non sequitur? 
It’s likeliest, but — 

Maybe he's an interstellar 
tourist from a world where there 
is no weather at all ! 

It’s a dazzler, I admit; I have 
no idea of what such a place 
would be like. It can’t just be 
lack of an atmosphere, for there 
would be temperature changes, 
meteor rains and radiation storms 
such as the Moon has. Then 
what? 

Maybe he's from some part of 
this or another planet that chooses 
its weather — by democratic 
means, I hope — or decides to 
skip the whole thing. 

Mark Twain may have had a 
suspicion that this could be. In 
one of his books, he added an 
appendix with a wide variety of 
weather; the reader could pick 
whatever he thought most suit- 
table for each scene ... or none!

MATRIX THE STRATEGY GAME 



BASED ON THE NEW THEORY OF GAMES 

The Theory of Games is in the news! It has been revealed that top-level government 
planners use the Theory of Games to formulate basic policy. Economists find the Theory- 
of Games an invaluable new tool. All branches of the military have revised their logis- 
tic and strategic concepts in the light of this new Theory. Workers in all branches of 
Science find that the Theory of Games provides new avenues of approach to unsolved 
problems and places new interpretations on existing data. 

MATRIX, a simple and interesting game based on the Theory of Games, trains you 
to think subconsciously in the new logic of this Theory. 

Two MATRIX players take turns placing their numbered markers. They could assem- 
ble a matrix that looks like the figure illustrated. 

The player who placed the Black tiles selects 
a horizontal row on his indicator; the player 
who placed the white tiles selects a vertical 
column on his indicator. On the first play of 
this particular matrix, both players simultane- 
ously reveal their indicators set as shown. 

WHITE scores 5 points. If you were BLACK, 
in what proportion should you destribute your 
choices among the rows A B C D to be sure 
of winning this particular game over a series of 
plays regardless of what WHITE may do? 

After you have played several games of 
MATRIX by guesswork alone, you begin in- 
tuitively to solve problems such as the one 
illustrated above. Though MATRIX is a simple 
enough game for a child to play, a new fac- 
tor rapidly becomes apparent. MATRIX is 
unique! In chess or checkers you plan your 
next move only after your opponent has made 
his move. In MATRIX, because both players 
reveal their choices simultaneously, you must 
think from two points of view at the same time! 

The new multi-valued logic inherent in the 
Theory of Games becomes a new thought 
habit as you use it in the concrete situations 
MATRIX provides. This fascinating game is 
a training aid to reach a higher order of 
thinking! 

MATRIX, the strategy game, based on the Theory of Games includes a handsome 
8x8 board, 16 gold-stamped plastic markers, two indicators, score pad, pencil, and a 
24 page booklet. The first two pages of the booklet tell you how to play MATRIX. 
Then the booklet explains some of the basic concepts of the Theory of Games. It 
shows you how to arrive at an arithmetical approximation to the solution of a matrix 
problem such as the one above. In addition it gives examples of the application of the 
Theory of Games to conflict situations in marketing ana military strategy.

It was as clean as a world can be— but why 
had Collins killed himself— and how was it 
I fell, I died, I saw another at the well? 



1 CAME out of it screaming, 
with the light covers a bind- 
ing weight. Then my feet 
were cool on the solid comfort of 
the floor and miraculously the 
sound was dead. 

Slowly, sense by sense, I began 
to wake up. To the taste of salt. 
A rasp in my throat. A sudden 
chill of sweat beginning to evapo- 
rate between my rigid shoulder- 
blades. 

There were minutes when my 
heart beat the breath from my 
throat before it seemed to reach 
my lungs . 

And then it was over. I stood 
up, kicked free of the fallen 
covers. The sick hammering be- 
gan to subside. 

I was awake. 

I was not dead. 

I stood there in the middle of 
the floor and thought about it. 
I was awake and alive and my 
head swam in an ocean of relief. 

THE DREAMING WALL

J SNAPPED on the light, turn- 
ed the heat on under the coffee 
pot, lit a cigarette. Then I switch- 
ed on the transmitter and sat 
down in front of the mike, wait- 
ing for the green light to blink on. 
“Beck to Central,” I said. 
“Hello, Johnny,” Donovan’s 
voice answered through the 
speaker. “What brings you in this 
hour of the night?” 

“Get me Radford.” 

“You’re kidding.” 

“I’m not.” 

“What’s the matter, boy?” 

“I’d appreciate your concern 
more if you got the lead out and 
put me through to Radford.” 
There was a long pause after 
that one. I let it sink in. I didn’t 
want to make things rough on 
Donovan, but I was too knotted 
up to do anything about it. 

And then he said, “Okay, 
Johnny. But you know what it’s 
like, rousting out top brass at 
two A.M.” 

Vague sounds and a receding 
rustle told me he had left the 
microphone. His tone had sug- 
gested that ears would burn in 
descending chain of command 
until someone tried to get my 
job. I got a perverse kick out of 
the idea. Then the coffee pot 
murmured, the rich, astringent 
aroma knifing through the gath- 
ering smoke. 

I found last night’s cup, nearly 
filled it, dug into my gear for 



the pint of brandy and added a 
good splash. After swallowing 
half a cup straight down, I felt 
more human and began won- 
dering — now that the fear was 
gone, now that my hands had 
stopped shaking and the sweat 
was dry — what I would say to 
Colonel Radford. 

If I got through to him. 

I didn’t. The voice that final- 
ly came through was narrow, 
hard-edged and tightly control- 
led, like its owner. 

“Beck! Are you mad?” 

“No, Major,” I told the micro- 
phone. 

"Then you know why Collins 
shot himself.” 

“No. I want ...” 

“Listen, Beck.” I imagined 
Major Castle squaring off in 
front of the microphone. “Some- 
how you threw a big enough 
scare into Donovan to start a 
fuse to Radford’s bunk. It was 
blind luck that I was up and 
able to stamp on it. Damn it, 
will you ever learn that there 
are such things as channels?” 
“No,” I said. “I’m a lousy ci- 
vilian. Remember?” 

lV/I'EMORY came over the air 
-L” as a pause and a helpless, 
shoulder - shrugging sigh. “All 
right, Beck. What is it?” 

And that was just the point : I 
didn’t know. At least I wasn’t 
sure. I killed the cigarette and

thought a moment before an- 
swering. “First, am I supposed 
to be in any danger?” 

“Of course not!” 

“Second, I want all the infor- 
mation now available on Fallon’s 
planet . 

“That’s what you } re supposed 
to be doing, isn’t it?” Castle par- 
ried. 

“Sure — in my field. But I want 
all the dope that comes in — in- 
cluding the reports from the 
other Anthro men — as it comes 
in. Also all earlier reports; medi- 
cal, biological, chemical, the 
works. Third, I want Collins’ 
file.” 

“You saw the department’s 
summary,” Castle objected. 

“Sure. And I knew the man 
three years. Don’t forget that. 
I knew him as well as you ever 
get to know a man you work 
with. But I’ve no more idea why 
he’d blow his brains out than 
you have.” 

Castle’s tight voice said,* “He 
was a neurotic, Beck. I’ve been 
studying the case myself, of 
course. He only just scraped by 
on his last psych test. Rated 
0.75—” 

“When 1.00 is the norm and 
point six the safety minimum for 
this job, that doesn’t mean a 
thing. The Psych boys are too 
good to slip up on a thing like 
that. Look, Major — Collins 
wasn’t the type to commit sui-

cide because he was alone for 
three days. After a long enough 
time, you might do it yourself 
and so might anyone, but not 
after three days and not just be- 
cause you couldn’t talk to any- 
one. What about his radio equip- 
ment? Any sign of tampering?” 
“None. We checked every mil- 
limeter. The generator gave out. 
You know field men are sup- 
posed to keep track of their own 
equipment. He should have ap- 
plied for replacements six 
months ago. Anthro hasn’t a kick 
coming on that score, Beck.” 
“No one’s kicking, Major. The 
fact remains that he shot himself. 
Until we find out why, there’s a 
chance of an overlooked danger 
factor on Fallon’s planet and it’s 
not my job to find it.” 

The speaker breathed irritably. 
Finally the major said, “Well?” 
“I want another man out here.” 
“If you mean one of mine and 
not an Anthro man, you’re crazy. 
I can’t spare one.” 

“Anthro’s out and you know 
it.” 

“There isn’t a man I can — ” 
“I never learned about chan- 
nels, Major.” 

“All right, you crumb. Tomor- 
row morning.” 

“Fine.” 

“One detail, Beck.” The dis- 
embodied voice took on a bassy 
rumble, as though he had edged 
nearer the mike to emphasize his 

9 




point. I could feel it coming. “One 
question. Why, Beck?” 

A ND that was it. Why? With 
the lights on, with the 
warmth of the brandy and coffee 
inside me, the chill gone and com- 
fortably familiar equipment on 
every side, it was hard to think 
clearly, almost hard to remem- 
ber. But I did remember. The 
dream. The opaque, undetailed 
dream. The noise my throat had 
made when I came out of it. 

“I’m scared,” I said. “That’s 
all. Good night.” 

I switched off the set. The green 
eye died under a dark cataract. 
The beginning of a word fell out 
of the loudspeaker, slurring off 
more like the forgotten end to a 
sad story than the start of some- 
thing, and I stood up and drained 
the coffee cup. 

I wasn’t ready for sleep again. 
I wasn’t ready to think about 
sleep. There was a lot to be done 
in the morning, but the urge to 
be at it, coupled with the thought 
of working after a sleepless night, 
only magnified my tension and 
made me all the less inclined to 
get back on the cot. 

I put on shoes and a light coat, 
picked up my cigarettes and 
opened the prefab’s door. The 
cool, dreamy air of Fallon’s plan- 
et came through the opening. 

Shale and crumbled masonry 
and powdered rock made a reas- 

10 



suring sound underfoot. Outside, 
I leaned against that incredible 
wall and looked down long mo- 
ments at my job. 

It lay in a deep saucer of land 
below the wall in whose lee the 
prefab had been set, surrounded 
by low hills, a vague, pale pic- 
ture of ruin and soft shadow un- 
der the triplet moons. Military 
and Anthro files spelled its name, 
like the many others listed, with 
key initial and land -mass number 
followed by cartographic coor- 
dinates, and described it with 
code symbols distilled from the 
reports of men like myself and 
our successors, a precise, econ- 
omical, deadly nomenclature for 
dead things. 

Anthro’s job was to catalogue 
the myriad cultures, living or 
otherwise, encountered in the 
course of Galactic exploration. It 
was part of the never-ending 
process of refining the statistical 
technique of culture analysis and 
trait prediction. Lone men did 
the preliminary work, specialists 
dropped around to make expert 
guesses, to outline work to come 
and estimate time and material 
needed for full-scale investigation 
if such were justified. 

The hill-cupped ruin had been 
Collins’ job. He had come to it 
ten days before. The construction 
men had put up the prefab in 
the shade of the wall on the 'taw 
hill-top, run the water hose to 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




the stream in the hollow and 
then left him. 

Seventy-two hours later — sixty- 
eight, perhaps, from the genera- 
tor’s failure — Collins was dead. 
On the fifth day, the crew that 
had flown out to investigate his 
radio silence found him in the 
prefab, the pistol butt still lying 
across his fingers. 

C OLLINS was dead, but the 
job was not. And in the 
vague, bright-cloudy light of 
the tight-running moons, the city 
seemed to be living, wrapped in 
some quiet fantasy, remembering 
itself and the days and the ages 
it had known. 

Perhaps, in the daytime, it 
slept more deeply. 

Daylight was still five hours 
away. There was nothing I could 
do till then, no matter how little 
I felt like bed. I had a final smoke 
before going back into the cabin 
and closing out the night. But 
I could not close out the job or 
Collins or the way he had died. 

I could not close out other 
things. 

I had one thing to be proud of 
next morning. I shaved. Casual 
inspection would have shown how 
badly. I misset the dial on the 
stove, scorched my breakfast and 
threw it out disgustedly. My 
breakfast was more coffee. When 
I was through, my head had 
stopped pounding and the jitters 



had retreated a pace, but my eves 
throbbed and a gritty sensation 
clogged the lids. 

I got little enough done, and 
was inside when the long-hop 
beetle arrived at eleven. When 
I went out to see who the major 
had detailed to help me, I found 
Castle himself climbing toward 
the prefab. Perhaps because he 
had come eight hundred kilo- 
meters since breakfast, perhaps 
for other reasons, the major was 
unhappy. His greeting was limit- 
ed to a brief nod. 

“All right, Beck. You’ve got 
your other man.” He was a tall, 
loosely built individual, lean as 
a rail and if not quite as hard 
the difference was one to interest 
only a professional hair-splitter. 
The voice and face were more 
edged than usual. I stood aside 
from the door and invited him in. 

“I didn’t mean to inconveni- 
ence you, Major.” 

“I’m sure. I told you I was 
short-handed, Beck. I wasn’t jok- 
ing.” 

“Neither was I.” 

TTIS pale, unquiet eyes covered 
the room, flicking from item 
to item — the unmade cot, the 
cluttered desk, the stove, the ra- 
dio and transmitter, the file racks 
and recording apparatus. His dis- 
pleasure increased. 

“There’s a long jump between 
Anthro and the Military,” he 



THE DREAMING WALL 



11 




said. “Understand. I have no 
quarrel with the principle of sep- 
aration. There’s no reason why 
the two forces can’t operate with 
maximum efficiency under the 
present setup.” 

I almost added, “And civilian 
control,” but managed to restrain 
myself. 

“But. While I see no call for 
your department to be under my 
command — Colonel Radford’s 
command — I resent any attempt 
by Anthropology to treat Mili- 
tary as its own sub-department, 
errand-runner or whipping boy.” 
“Okay, Major.” 

“You men are ahead of us in 
public relations, Beck. You’ve 
instilled a prejudice against Mili- 
tary.” 

“There’s a long history behind 
that, Major.” 

“But you’ve overloaded this 
time, and that’s why I’m here. 
I know what sort of stink you’d 
raise back home, if you didn’t 
get another man when you asked 
for one, so I’m here on a double- 
purpose mission: to fulfill your 
request and to issue a detailed re- 
port. This had better be good.” 
He looked over the cabin again. 
“Your place is a mess. Looks as 
if you had an all-night party.” 
His repellent eyes looked keen- 
ly at me from under straight 
brows. “Been drinking, Beck?” 
I met the look long enough to 
show him I was able to, then 



shrugged and dipped into the 
wastebasket. I showed him the 
brandy bottle. “This much,” I 
told him. 

He smiled suddenly out of his 
eyes, though the controlled con- 
tours of his face never varied. I 
threw the bottle back into the re- 
ceptacle. 

“One pint of brandy, Major. 
D’you suppose Anthro should 
pass a rule against liquor?” 

“It might help.” 

“With the psych tests we sur- 
vive? I’m healthy as a rock, phy- 
sically and mentally. Yet last 
night I did my best to drink my- 
self into a stupor. There wasn’t 
enough liquor.” 

The smile left his eyes. “Two 
men? One after the other? The 
whole planet was given the stand- 
ard treatment by Medical. We’ve 
been on Safety Schedule Green 
for six weeks now. Every report 
shows it clean as a whistle.” 
“Something overlooked?” 

He shrugged. “Such as?” 

T THOUGHT it over a moment 
before telling him, wondering 
with half my head what his brisk, 
medicinal reaction would be. He 
waited, smothering impatience 
and exuding overbearing self-con- 
fidence. 

“Before I radioed in last night,” 
I told him, “I had a dream. A 
nightmare. I don’t remember 
what it was about. I woke up 



12 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




screaming my head off. After I’d 
talked to you, I went out and 
looked down on that ruin you 
flew over before I managed to 
talk myself into hitting the sack 
again. It took me an hour to get 
to sleep and fifteen minutes for 
the dream to wake me again. I 
drank half the bottle and tried 
again. The third time I killed it 
and got two hours sleep. Then 
I didn’t have any more anesthetic 
and wasn’t ready to try again 
anyhow.” 

Castle did not react visibly — 
a characteristic reaction of his. 
He might have shown surprise, 
disgust, contempt, concern. He 
might have dropped his jaw, 
thrown back his head and laugh- 
ed the roof off at the idea of a 
reportedly intelligent, physically 
powerful specimen of Homo sa- 
piens, male sex, holder of three 
academic degrees, suddenly fall- 
ing prey to dreams that threat- 
ened to unhinge him. He did none 
of these. 

Instead he crossed to the desk, 
pulled out the folding chair and 
sat down looking up at me . 
speculatively, then with a barely 
perceptible hint of malice. He 
said after a while, “What did you 
dream about? Collins’ suicide?” 

“I told you. I don’t remember.” 
I sat down on the rumpled cot. 
“Not the first time, nor the second 
or third times. None of the details, 
I mean. But I do remember the 

THE DREAMING WALL 



over-all emotional quality.” 

I interlaced my fingers. Castle 
noticed, gave my hands a glance 
that made me want to belt him. 
“Well?” 

“I was dying. I went through 
every physical and emotional 
process of dying, up to and ex- 
cept the final extinction of the 
last thought and feeling.” 

“I see.” His speculative look 
tightened. I imagined the pupils 
contracting, catlike, into vertical 
slits. He said thoughtfully, “Of 
course I checked your own psych 
rating, Beck.” 

“It’s good. Damn good.” 

“One point two, maximum va- 
riation of 0.3 in the last three 
years.” 

A LL personnel underwent full- 
dress medical and psych tests 
annually. Earth time. The slight- 
est deviation in health and psy- 
chological makeup might push a 
man over the border of safety, 
and while few enough external 
dangers were encountered in the 
work, a wide margin had to be 
maintained. 

“You dropped to 0.9 after that 
bout with Hillman’s fever,” he 
added. “Your last attack was 
eighteen months ago. You might 
be suffering from some unknown 
after-effect.” 

“Hillman’s fever is practically 
a duplicate of Terrestrial ma- 
laria,” I said bluntly. “Medical

gave me a clean bill of health. I 
trust Medical. Even Military- 
Medical. And Collins never had 
the disease.” 

“That’s right.” Castle stood up, 
slid the chair neatly under the 
desk. “Collins never had the dis- 
ease. Have you already decided 
that Collins blew his brains out 
because he was trapped here 
alone with dreams of death?” 

And that brought me up short, 
without a word in my mouth. 
Because even if the long shot paid 
off and it turned out to be true, 
it was as yet an unwarranted 
assumption; and it was for damn 
sure I’d had no intention of let- 
ting Castle know I believed it. 
I hadn’t thought I did believe it. 

But now, irrationally, trapped 
— I realized that I did. 

The preliminary skirmish was 
over and there were things to 
be done. I made the cot up for 
the night, while Castle went back 
to the waiting beetle to collect 
his gear and send the craft back 
to Base Camp with, I suspected, 
a verbal message to Colonel Rad- 
ford. 

On the other hand, being the 
man he was, he might get a per- 
verse kick out of making a derog- 
atory radio report in my hearing. 
I shrugged the idea off and tried 
to build up a wall of indifference 
to the overbearing man with the 
pale, overconfident eyes while 
tidying up the cabin. 



I had just lit a cigarette and 
switched on the heat under the 
remains of the breakfest coffee 
when he returned, carrying a 
valise under one arm and a tight- 
ly rolled sleeping bag under the 
other. 

H E slid his sleeping bag out 
of the way under the cot. “I 
sent the beetle back. I gave the 
pilot instructions to be relayed to 
the appropriate officers at Base 
Camp concerning radio commu- 
nication, We’ll make contact at 
0800, 1200 and 2000 hours daily, 
our time. Failing report, the Com- 
munications officer will send out 
a detail at once, top priority. He 
will do the same if at any time 
either of us attempts to change or 
abrogate these instructions. I’m 
sure you’ll find the arrangement 
satisfactory.” 

“Sure, Major. I suppose you 
sent word that so far the only 
visible disturbance was an An- 
thro man with nightmares?” 

“Of course,” he said in some 
surprise. 

“Have some coffee,” I said 
dead-pan. “What’s your psych 
rating, Major?” 

He said it was one-point-o, un- 
locked his valise and produced 
a bulging brief case. 

“Everything you asked for, 
Beck.” He dropped the brief case 
on the desk and threw it open. 
“Scientific reports on every as-

pect of Fallon’s planet to date; 
copies of everything Anthropol- 
ogy has collected or surmised, 
Medical’s file on Collins, the 
works. Also this.” He drew out a 
yellow medical report and slap- 
ped it down face up, where I 
could read the inscription. #SA- 
35209. Beck , John Hale. He park- 
ed himself on the cot. “Let’s get 
to work.”. 

It took four hours. Castle’s 
manner advertised the belief that 
the whole procedure was a waste 
of time, but he was surgical in 
his thoroughness and knew the 
business inside and out, every 
detail of it. 

Fallon’s planet was an “A” in- 
dex world: A2-ca in its main 
classification; “A” meaning 
Earth -type, or supporting human 
life without artificial aids such 
as repirators, synthetic foods or 
anti-grav. The numeral dealt 
with intelligent life-forms, “2” the 
negative designation: “c” native 
fauna below the level of Terres- 
trial primates, “a” floral develop- 
ment, the rest of the long index 
being devoted to a coded break- 
down detailing information con- 
tained in the first four units. 

There were those — Terrestrial 
and otherwise — who had chuckled 
over the presumption of Earth- 
men establishing a scale of values 
that set Terran standards as the 
peak of evolutionary achieve- 
ment, and others who had reacted 



differently. The semantically in- 
clined had done the same over 
our naming the cultural research 
program Anthropology, but the 
quibbles were philosophical and 
no one denied that the system 
was efficient. 

A man with Castle’s qualifi- 
cations — or mine, or Collins’ — 
could give a thorough description 
of a planet from the one-line in- 
dex alone, and postulate further 
data with a high percentage of 
accuracy. 

A NTHRO’S key in the index 
was parenthesized as tenta- 
tive, except for the absence of 
the race that had established the 
culture or cultures whose remains 
had been found. Although not 
enough data was in to support 
statistical guesswork, extrapola- 
tion suggested — and the report 
carefully underlined the word — 
independent city states, possibly 
not dissimilar to the Mayan, a 
non-humanoid life-form, proba- 
bly Level III, agrarian, artistic, 
religious in some manner or 
other. 

The sum total was no more 
than a man with good eyes and 
a predilection for morning walks 
would have learned in a week. 

“Satisfied with the report?” 
Castle demanded. “I 'told you the 
planet was clean.” 

I skimmed over Medical’s re- 
port again. Its concluding sum- 



THE DREAMING WALL 



15 




mation read like a hymn of 
praise. Fallon’s planet was the 
world the human race should 
have chosen to develop on. The 
list of poisonous flora was still 
growing, the medics warned, but 
edible varieties, described and 
classified ad nauseum, abounded 
on all three major land masses. 

I added the report to the grow- 
ing pile on my left. “All right, 
it’s clean.” 

For the rest of it: the planet 
was slightly larger than Terra, 
its gravity a shade lighter. A 
200-pounder would land to carry 
five or six fewer pounds on his 
bones. Its rotation period was 
divisible by chronometric modi- 
fication into twenty-four arbi- 
trary hours each about 4.3 
minutes longer than an Earth 
hour. A couple of the inert gas- 
ses were missing from the atmos- 
phere, oxygen content ran a 
fraction higher, and water vapor 
content was on a par with the 
Levant on a summer day. 

“Nuts,” I said, and emptied 
the coffee pot. 

“Collins’ record.” 

We took it item by item, though 
I knew pretty much what it con- 
tained. A tall, dark, hard-eyed 
man with a penchant for direct 
action that must have thwarted 
many an official of Castle’s type 
during the eight years he had 
worked with the department. Col- 
lins had contracted bronchial 



pneumonia as a boy, after falling 
in a river on a hunting trip. To 
a spinterish psychologist, hunt- 
ing for pleasure had suggested a 
streak of atavism to be watched, 
but the only significant item in 
his general analysis was his class- 
ification as a marked cycloid. I 
knew he had worried over his 
psych rating, but he had never 
pulled lower than an 0.71. 
“Indicative?” 

1 SAID positively, “No. He was 
used to the job and he liked 
it too, Major. His rating drop- 
ped and wavered a few points 
after his wife ditched him three 
years ago— and remember, Hel- 
lene was around a long time be- 
fore she was transferred to 
another starship. Then he climbed 
from the low to a point seven 
five on his last medical. That’s 
0.15 above the minimum required 
for the job. Not too much, but 
enough. The 0.60 minimum isn't 
a neurotic rating, Major. It just 
indicates base qualifications for 
a lonely job. Isn’t there a well- 
established theory that no one 
rated higher than point three is 
capable of suicide? 

Castle shrugged tightly. “A fit 
of depression, aggravated by en- 
forced radio silence. Ratings are 
annual. Anything might have 
happened to him in the last few 
months. A manic-depressive — ” 
“Cycloid,” I insisted. “Your 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




own file probably classifies you 
as a schizoid personality. Does 
that make you an incipient hebe- 
phrene or catatonic?” 

Castle said, “Look here, Beck. 
If the man had not been danger- 
ously neurotic he wouldn’t have 
killed himself. That’s bedrock.” 
“And the dreams?” 

“If he had the dreams.” 

Yes. If he had the dreams . 
Castle said, “If a man in my 
command had recurrent night- 
mares that impaired his efficien- 
cy, I’d turn him over to Medical 
without a second thought. In 
space, on alien worlds, you can’t 
take chances with mental incom- 
petents.” 

W ITH the reports out of the 
way by mid -afternoon, we 
had two good hours of sunlight 
left to explore the dreamy ruin. 
Key initial, land mass number, 
and all the other drearily prac- 
tical attributes of scientific iden- 
tification could not disguise its 
quality of haunted charm. In the 
white, clear warmth of the after- 
noon sun, it lay quiet and sadly 
serene. The air was like cool silk. 
It raised no dust. I thought it 
must be always spring on Fallon’s 
planet. 

If you measured from the wall 
that backed the Anthro prefab to 
an isolated cluster of unidenti- 
fiable masonry on the far side, 
the city, was about three hundred 



meters across at its widest point. 
In closer truth, it was a sixty- 
ineter walk from the wall to the 
crumble marking the real peri- 
meter; a downhill walk over 
ground no different from the 
bronzed grass slopes visible on 
every side, and the city itself 
a mere two-hundred -meter nucle- 
us of gray and blue-white walls 
slowly falling in on themselves. 

The major was quiet in these 
surroundings. 

The city had once had a cen- 
tral street that was now just a 
clearer path than any other; a 
diameter bisecting its rough circle. 
Halfway along it to the farther 
edge was the miracle I wanted 
to show the major first, before 
he had time to clamp his effi- 
cient, military mind against the 
initial effect the city had on him; 
before he started talking again 
and the texture of the city and 
the afternoon was tom apart by 
statistics, callibrations, scientific 
guesses . 

“What is it?” 

We approached the parapet. It 
rose knee-high in the center of 
the street, thousands of years 
old, more thousands deserted, 
worn by countless equivalent 
hands and arms and elbows and 
then by the winds and the points 
of wind-borne sand that even this 
clear atmosphere must carry, as 
the days of life and feeling drifted 
backward to forgetfulness, and 



THE DREAMING WALL 



17 




only the walls and beams and 
fallen roofs remained. 

“A well,” I told him. I sat on 
the parapet, Castle leaned both 
hands on it and bent, peering 
over the rim into the cool, shad- 
owed cylinder that sank away in 
narrowing concentric circles to 
the mercurial coin of water far 
below. Moss had gathered in 
green shadow. Here and there 
time had warped the pattern of 
the stones, raising one, lowering 
another, subtly altering perspec- 
tive. The well was an oasis, alive 
and smelling green and fresh. 

“T’LL be damned,” he said sud- 
denly. “The stones are carv- 
ed. They’re carved in bas-relief.” 
“Not just individually, Major. 
The carving on each stone is part 
of a larger pattern.” 

“I wonder what it represents.” 
He leaned further over the rim, 
peering intently. 

“I don’t know. We’ll find out 
later, when we get a full crew out 
here and can get down to look. I 
don’t have the equipment or I’d 
have been down to the water’s 
edge yesterday. They’ve been 
protected down there, Major. 
The best -preserved decorations in 
the place.” 

“There’s more?” He sat down. 
“A lot. When we go back, take 
a closer look at that hunk of wall 
up by the prefab. It seems to 
have been covered on both sides, 



but the stone is pitted so badly 
most of the details are gone for 
good. And down here it’s every- 
where. Symbolic stuff, from the 
shapes. Probably enough to jus- 
tify the full-scale archeological 
research. It’s rich, Major. Must 
have been quite a place, no mat- 
ter what the natives looked like. 

“I’ll tell you something. I’ve 
been a field man with Anthro for 
ten years. I’ve seen dozens of 
cultures, living and dead. I’ve 
prowled through so many ruins 
that once the work’s done and 
the reports are in, each one blurs 
into all the ones before it and 
there’s nothing to remember it 
by. But not this time.” 

“No?” He raised an interroga- 
tive eyebrow. But the gunbarrel 
directness had left his eyes, and 
his look was of a man no longer 
dominating his environment but 
rather responding to it, and that 
was what I wanted. 

“No,” I said. “It’s hard to ex- 
plain.” 

And it was, too. It’s never easy 
to impart the intangibles of feel- 
ing that hover on the verge of 
conscious thought, but can’t quite 
make the crossing. Especially to 
a man like Castle whose recep- 
tivity is an ephemeral thing that 
one wrong association can dis- 
rupt. 

I went carefully then, easing 
my way, letting the well and the 
air and the sleeping city do their 



18

part. It was their story. My job 
was to help him listen to it. 

He listened, all right, listened 
while his conscious mind heard 
me telling him that this one city 
was more than a scattered mass 
of inanimate stone and clay to be 
named in terms of its location 
and described with years and 
chemical formulae; because it 
was a picture, a dream, a feeling, 
and wherever you went the feel- 
ing dominated, emanating from 
each block of stone, from jagged 
walls and powdered mortar, from 
every nook and shadow: a thread 
of joy, a nostalgic mist, and 
something else . 

He nodded slowly, his now 
guiet eyes looking and not look- 
ing, a long way off. And then he 
said in wonder, “I wonder why 
the damn fool shot himself?” 

It was inevitable, I guess. The 
stark incongruity had to intrude, 
and once the idea was there he 
gave it words that brought him 
back to who he was and what he 
was engaged in. The characteris- 
tic focus returned to his eyes. The 
mood was gone. 

I stood up. “Maybe we’ll find 
out.” 

W E roamed until sunset. We 
outlined individual build- 
ings as clearly as we could, esti- 
mated their height and dug 
around with our hands in the 
rubble in the hope of finding arti- 

THE DREAMING WALL 



facts, but without success. 

We surveyed the superficial, 
and I dug into my memory of 
survey composites to help form a 
picture of what the city might 
have been, and how its people 
lived and what they looked like. 

Thorough as usual, Castle 
caught on quickly, made his own 
deductions from what I told him 
and what he saw. The inhabit- 
ants, we thought, had walked up- 
right, with an average five-feet 
height. Perhaps they were bipeds. 
Such stairs as we found were of 
comfortable depth. 

By the time we had begun to 
climb back to the prefab, my 
head had started to throb and the 
sting had come back to my eyes. 
Though the day had been rela- 
tively easy, the night before had 
not, and Castle’s presence was 
the worst hangover remedy that 
had ever been forced on me. But 
I knew how I was going to treat 
the sleep problem tonight. I also 
knew what the major would 
think. 

I got the first-aid kit out, as 
soon as we had cleaned up after 
dinner. He was instantly on 
guard. 

“What’s the idea, Beck?” 

“I’m taking no chances.” I fit- 
ted a sterile needle to the hypo- 
dermic, punctured the sedative 
phial and drew two c.c. into the 
cylinder. “I need the sleep.” 

Castle looked studiously indif- 

19 




ferent. The sting in my forearm 
was momentarily sharp, then 
sharp again as the needle with- 
drew. 

“Five- hour shifts?” he sug- 
gested. 

“Okay, Major.” 

S LEEP came in minutes. I 
heard him moving around, 
then the click as he switched on 
the transmitter to warm it up for 
the evening report to Base Camp, 
but the drug and the tiredness 
took effect before he made con- 
tact and I didn’t hear a word 
of it. 

Nor did I dream. The com- 
fortable falling-away preceding 
sleep merged into the sharper 
climb to consciousness, as the 
major’s hand on my shoulder 
shook me awake. 

I rolled out, got into shoes and 
trousers. I felt better, but the 
effect of the sedative still clogged 
my head and slowed my think- 
ing. Coffee complained on the 
stove. In the few minutes it took 
to wash and pour some coffee 
down my throat, Castle unfolded 
the sleeping bag on the cot and 
bedded down. 

“Any trouble tonight, . Beck?” 
“None. There’s a lot to be done 
tomorrow, Major . 

“I’ll be ready for it.” 

He stretched once in his co- 
coon, turned away from the light, 
and that was all. In moments, I 



knew, he’d be swiftly and dis- 
ciplinedly asleep. 

I sat down at the desk with 
another mug of coffee and lit a 
cigarette, looking blearily into 
the next five hours. They stretch- 
ed ahead in a drugged fog. There 
was nothing to do but read, noth- 
ing to read but the reports, and 
not a chance in a thousand of 
getting anything new from them. 

I fought for a while to bring 
some of the edge back to my 
mind, gave up and got the re- 
ports out anyway. I went through 
the Medical on Fallon’s planet 
first, then opened the one on 
Collins. 

The major’s breathing became 
rhythmic, peaceful.

cernible, but nothing significant

It went on for pages and was 
followed by more of the same, 
this time in elaborate tabular 
form incomprehensible to the 
layman. But the final analysis 
was undebatable. Collins was 
normal. He had been to the last. 

Or almost the last. 

I pushed the report aside.

I N the sleeping bag the major 
shifted, stretched again, re- 
laxed into deeper sleep. As soon 
as he was settled, I switched on 
the transmitter. 

“Beck to Central.” 

“Hi, Johnny,” Donovan’s voice 
said in surprise. I turned the 
speaker down till he was barely 
audible. He went on with odd 
inflection, “I didn’t expect you in 
tonight ...” 

“Did you take Castle’s eight 
o’clock report?” 

“Come again?” 

“Gain me up. Castle’s asleep 
and I don’t want to wake him . 
Did you take his report tonight?” 
“Yeah. He dictated in full. We 
got it on crystal, with orders to 
prepare copies to go to various 
agencies. Pretty heavy stuff, 
Johnny. Want me to play it back 
for you?” 

“Don’t bother. Give me the 
gist.” 

Donovan hesitated. 

“Well . He took a big slap 
at you, and another at Anthro. 
Hints that you and Collins 
should’ve been suspended long 
ago. He thinks something’s off- 
beam in Medical for passing you 
guys.” 

“Is he after my job?” 

“Looks that way. Jesus, man, 
what’s this about you poking 
merodine into your arm to make 
you sleep?” 

“Is he trying to make a case 



out of that?” I asked angrily. 

“Trying, hell! Listen, Johnny. 
You’re up to your neck. You 
know how that guy operates. De- 
tails, channels. He never over- 
looks a thing. Reading between 
the lines . you know what I 
think?” 

“That he’ll start a move to in- 
corporate the civilian services 
into the military setup?” 

“With you as fall guy. Some- 
one’s always agitating. All they’ll 
need is one good fall guy. You’ll 
have to pull something shrewd, 
Johnny. What’s up your sleeve?” 
“Not a damn thing. I’m riding 
a hunch and betting on my psych 
rating. Anything new from the 
Anthro field men?” 

“Yeah. Marius found another 
ruin way south on Land Mass 
II. I was on the board when he 
recorded a prelim. Indications 
are it’s the same as all the others 
— same race, at least. But it’s all 
shot to hell. Climate’s rougher 
down there. Oh, yeah. Hanson 
thinks he’s discovered what they 
looked like. The inhabitants, I 
mean. He’s sending in his recon- 
struction as soon as he completes 
it.” 

“Relief carvings?” 

“That’s right. Trouble is, he 
says the rock they’re carved on 
has undergone some process or 
other, I forget what he called it. 
Anyway, what he means is it’s so 
pitted and bored through it’s

hard to make out the details and 
crumbles easily. That mean any- 
thing to you?” 

“Maybe. There’s some of it 
around here. I want those reports 
verbatim.” 

“I’ll dig ’em up as soon as I 
go off duty.” 

“Don’t take any chances. Make 
out an official request, or what- 
ever routine is required of Mili- 
tary personnel. I don’t want the 
top brass saying Beck’s been un- 
dermining military morale and 
procedure.” 

“First thing, Johnny. I’ll have 
my relief play ’em for you.” 

“Fine . and, Donovan, chan- 
nels and everything considered, 
maybe you can . expedite the 
request, or whatever the official 
term is.” 

A faint chuckle came over the 
air. “I’m with you, Johnny. Any- 
thing else?” 

“That’ll do it. Good night.” 

T SWITCHER off. The trans- 
-*■ mitter died. I leaned back and 
chewed my lip. So maybe Hanson 
could tell us what they looked 
like. I doubted that it mattered 
much. Then there was the busi- 
ness about the stones’ appear- 
ance; the look of long subjection 
to a selective solvent that re- 
moved certain elements of its 
composition and left it honey- 
combed and crumbling. That 
probably didn’t matter either. 



But it was something to think 
about, if for no other reason than 
I had found it and Hanson had 
found it. Probably others would 
report it later on, and tie it in 
with some aspect of the job. 

So much for the job. Also, to 
hell with the job. My own prob- 
lem was just as big. 

The major rolled over, lay flat 
on his back and turned his face 
toward the light. Even in his 
sleep, he kept that look of unre- 
lenting self-control. He frowned 
against the light, now; pulled his 
head around uncomfortably. 

His neck glistened. 

I came out of the chair, wide- 
awake and watching intently. 
The prefab was at a comfortable 
temperature, the window open to 
the mild night. I stood so that the 
light fell directly upon him, light- 
ing the sweating skin, the corded 
neck, the accelerating pumping 
of the pulse in his throat, and 
held my breath . 

There was a netlike silence that 
caught and magnified the scrape 
cf suddenly tortured breathing 
from his open mouth. It con- 
tinued while the pulse ticked off 
rapid seconds. Sweat beaded and 
ran down his face. The muscles 
of his face and neck worked stiff- 
ly against themselves. 

Explosively the waiting ended. 
He reared, writhing out of the 
confines of the sleeping bag in a 
single motion, eyes open, hang-

jawed. His right hand snaked out 
holding a service pistol snatched 
with the precision of long train- 
ing from some hidden fold in the 
cocoon. 

His voice blurred unintelli- 
gibly. 

“What?” 

“The wall . he said thickly, 
and focus and recollection re- 
turned with startled, scared con- 
fusion to his eyes, 

“Major! Wake up!” 

“I’m awake.” He released a 
long breath. For a moment, he 
stared in stupefaction at the gun 
in his hand, now leveled vaguely 
at the prefab’s door across the 
room, muttered a curt obscenity 
and dropped it on the cot. He 
swung his legs to the floor and 
_ sat wiping the sweat from his 
face, watching me with antagon- 
ism, and then a futile baffled 
rage. 

“I heard you. Beck.” 

“Try again?” I asked him en- 
couragingly. 

“A scream, damn it.” 

I shook my head. He got up 
from the cot and went over to the 
washbowl, moving with a curious 
mixture of sleep-ridden loginess 
and deep agitation. When he had 
doused himself thoroughly, sting- 
ing himself to complete wakeful- 
ness, he came back toweling 
briskly. He wadded the towel, 
threw it on the cot and dropped 
beside it. 



TTE was trembling like a leaf. 

I waited. 

“Okay, Beck,” he said at last. 
“What was it about?” 

“As you told me. Death.” 
“You went through the whole 
thing?” 

“To the last flicker.” 

“Any details?” 

“Yes. Nothing meaningful, no 
sequence of events. Just the feel- 
ing and that damned wall, the 
wall outside, at night or dusk or 
something, I’m not sure which.” 
“Go on.” 

“And then, without rhyme or 
reason, the scream.” 

I frowned. 

“There was no warning, no 
preliminary sound. It just came. 
A full-throated scream that wa- 
vered and fell off into a gasp. I’d 
swear it was you. Beck, are you 
trying to pull something? I 
wouldn’t put it past you.” 

“I know. But I’m leveling.” 
“But damn it, I heard it!” He 
got up worriedly and began a 
sharp, angled pacing of the pre- 
fab. 

The long planes of his face 
glistened yellow -white and harsh. 
His stark physical fear had re- 
ceded, to be replaced by a baffled, 
bruised anger. “I heard it, Beck. 
I heard you.” 

“Screaming?” 

“Yes!” 

“Wrong night,” I said flatly. 
“That was yesterday.”

an extent suggestible, and I sup- 
pose I'm no exception. It’s en- 
tirely possible that suggestion 
alone stimulated the dream. Col- 
lins’ suicide, your experience, that 
damned evocative ruin . Does 
that make sense?” 

“Sure. What’s the alternative, 
Major?” 

“Is there one? You haven’t ex- 



plicitly propounded one, remem- 
ber. Do you attribute the 
recurrences to something in the 
environment? You’ve no evidence. 
Further. In attributing anything 
to ‘environment,’ do you do any- 
thing but give suggestion another 
name and make the matter hard- 
er to pin down?” 

“Do you believe that?” 




THE DREAMING WALL

He said crisply, “I don’t sub- 
ject myself to the strain of try- 
ing to believe what is intellectu- 
ally unacceptable.” 

“Okay, let’s quibble. I believe 
in the feeling and the evocative 
qualities of that ruin. That’s 
your word, remember. I’ve never 
felt so strongly that I was in the 
presence of something so . 
“Evidence!” Castle snapped. 
“God damn it, Castle. Feeling, 
thought, perception, the whole 
lousy lot are subjective and not 
susceptible to proof. If we go on 
like this I'll reduce it to solips- 
ism, and you don’t accept that 
any more than I do. All right, it’s 
hunch. But I tell you I know 
there’s . something.” 

He said angrily, “You sophis- 
tic son of a bitch. Is that how 
the civilian services operate?” 
“The dream,” I said. 

“Yes?” 

“Go back to sleep.” 

His habit of having second — 
and highly cerebral — thoughts, 
first to escape the danger of a 
possible thalamic reaction, left 
a brief second’s pause between 
stimulus and considered re- 
sponse. I jumped into it. 

“Go back to sleep. If you get 
five hours undisturbed, I’ll have 
to grant your point. If not . 

I let it hang. A line of muscle 
hardened in his jaw. His eyes 
were flat. 

“I’ll need the sleep.” 



“The medical kit’s over there.” 

He neither said anything nor 
moved for long moments. 

“Look, Major. I know what the 
nightmare’s like. I’m not trying 
to bat you over the head with it. 
If you want to use the stuff, go 
ahead. We’ll just have to see 
what we can dig up tomorrow.” 

At last he said, “I’ll use it.” I 
scored one for Beck. It was about 
time. 

T was the damnedest night. 

Castle sank into a drugged 
sleep. Without the stimulus of 
his antagonism, I felt myself 
slipping back into the old dull- 
headed lethargy. The argument 
had settled nothing. Still, Castle 
had dreamed. He had been badly 
shaken. That had to be a point 
in my favor. 

The long haul was what would 
count. I was pretty sure I was 
tougher than Castle, at least in 
the flexibility of mental fiber 
that comes with constant read- 
justment to the bizarre, the im- 
possible made concrete, the ap- 
parent chaos whose alien logic 
the Anthro field man must track 
down and define . 

I congratulated myself on be- 
ing tougher than Castle. 

Was he as brittle as I thought 
he was? How would he react if 
he had to get inside an alien cul- 
ture, view alien life without the 
flat perspective of an onlooker

armed with a gun and a set of 
Military orders? 

There is a vastness Man’s mind 
can never encompass. He mea- 
sures time in heartbeats, distance 
in walkable units he can cover 
between breakfast and lunch. 
Earth to Luna he can somehow 
grasp, but Earth to Mars is a 
figure on a printed page, or the 
vague oblong blur of remembered 
passage within the tight but com- 
fortable confines of an interplan- 
etary rocket. This gap is in space 
and comprehension, too. 

The stretched mind falls back 
on -Man-dimensioned figures of 
human life — the sensory expe- 
riences of sight and sound and 
touch and smell that always hold 
their meaning in themselves even 
when the fact, the mathematical 
equation, the incredible com- 
plexities of science and logic that 
lie ready to human use, but not 
to translation into the sensory 
language of human immediacy, 
deny them and their apparent 
meanings in their wedded entire- 
ties. 

To the draggled, ridge-ribbed 
pauper of Delhi or New London, 
an international dollar is a con- 
crete thing. He knows it as print- 
ed paper, worn or crisp, as so 
many eggs fried to specification, 
so many hours of warmth next 
to a dormitory radiator. There is 
wine in the thought of 3 dollar. 
There is nothing in the thought 



of a million, which is a figure, a 
symbol for “many,” a gauzy ab- 
straction the mind can never 
really objectify. And so it was 
with Castle and Military — and 
Beck and Anthro, too. 

We could never have started 
to chart the Galaxy but for the 
more sophisticated minds that 
handled our abstractions for us, 
reducing them to terms of pro- 
visions and training, free fall and 
gravities, the reading of gauges 
and the tidy concreteness of in- 
dividual actions performed on 
command. Those were easy. The 
sense-shackled mind could do as 
it pleased. The sophisticated 
minds — the electronic computers 
— made the real calculations . 

That was where toughness 
counted. 

Interplanetary and then inter- 
stellar flight had brought together 
living organisms so diverse, so 
fundamentally opposite in plan 
and in fabric, that the differences 
between them seemed as great 
and as basically incomprehen- 
sible as the gulfs that separated 
their mother planets. Red sand 
and sand rats. Festering swamps 
and carnivorous grasses. Bleak 
hills dipped in blood and the cal- 
lous maraudings of asocial liz- 
zards. 

I’d seen those myself, and 
many more; dead cultures and 
living, dead hells and living, the 
miracle of life from the primal,

struggling protoplasmic globs of 
Tycalpe to the intellectual splen- 
dor of the people of Tohn. Be- 
cause it was my job — because I 
had two and a half centuries of 
Anthro tradition behind me — I 
could find my way around in 
them and not come out a candi- 
date for the psychopathic ward. 
Anthro men had to be tough. Toq 
often we catalogued without un- 
derstanding, and it took the elec- 
tronic intelligence of the Anthro 
computers to work out the mean- 
ing of what we reported . 

I made a futile wish for access 
to one of them now. 

And somewhere along the line 
I fell asleep. 

rpHE reports were no help. 

Soon the lines of type began 
angling into each other in a 
bleary crisscross. I gave up all 
pretense of working on them. 
Castle breathed peacefully. 

As a desperation measure I 
tried organizing my ideas about 
the dream phenomenon on paper. 
But there were no ideas to be 
organized, only vague intuitions, 
the feeling that Collins’ suicide 
was a violation against sense 
hinting at the presence of some 
key factor not even guessed at. 

It was a dead end. 

I either slept or did not sleep. 

I wrote nothing. I wound up 
with a series of doodles crudely 
caricaturing the major, superim- 



posed it on a sketch of the city 
as seen from the prefab; the city 
and the well, the well and the 
wall, the wall and the builders, 
the dying, disappearing dead 
builders of the dream city . 
Cartographic coordinates met in 
the iris of an eye, melting like 
wax candles to droop and form 
arms, four tentacular arms with 
tendril-like ends to curl around 
tools and cut the reliefs of the 
stones in the well and the shapes 
on the wall before the attack of 
the drilling and nibbling effaced 
them. 

. And the desk had come up 
to press against my face, and I 
didn’t know how much I had 
sketched and how much I’d ima- 
gined. I knew, as dead certainty, 
only that a core of anxiety burn- 
ed at the base of my brain; and 
around it swam the cells and the 
tendrils, the barbs and the faces 
and the multi-faceted eyes of all 
the alien life I had ever met or 
heard about. Blood-ruby grains 
and sapphire nodules dredged 
from study and imagination 
floated like plankton in a cloudy 
sea . 

The wall . 

A day’s growth of beard prick- 
led back into my face from the 
pressure of the desk-top against 
which it lay. 

The low moan was mine, from 
another existence. 

The wall . 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




I shifted, head and arms lead- 
en, turned my face on the body- 
warmed surface and felt a burn- 
ing inward from the eyes. 

The wall loomed heavily in the 
foreboding. It was not a frag- 
foreboding. It was not a frag- 
ment. It was the total wall that 
had encircled the city. 

T HE first dream figure came 
up the hill. 

It — he? — was a biped. Tentac- 
ular arms hugged an obscure in- 
strument. Approaching the wall 
he set this down, his triangular 
head bent low as he adjusted 
some aspect of it. He stood, lift- 
ing it. A short, thick-snouted ad- 
dition had been affixed. He click- 
ed a switch. A hum began. The 
addition revolved, gathered speed. 
Gently, delicately, he applied it 
to the wall. Abraided particles 
fley. The design grew in sharp- 
ness under the artist’s touch . 

There is a property of dream- 
ing that fosters the growth of 
anxiety at variance with the overt 
content of the dream. In the 
shadow of a second, anxiety be- 
comes fear, fear becomes terror 
— a pounding, a drowning, a 
flight through space that ends 
with a sickened awakening, gasp- 
ing, drenched. 

My sleeping brain dreamed. 
The artist worked. 

My dreaming brain worried. 
And some part of me wondered 



at the conviction that here, some- 
where in this realm between the 
past and the present, lay the key 
that we needed. 

A bright thread of joy traced a 
counter -pattern on the fabric of 
fear. It was the joy of creation. 

I was the artist . and the 
abrasive bit molded the rock- 
face. 

The city was a hub, the center 
of a circle of life. About it, 
spreading in every direction, grew 
the tiny settlements and villages 
that were the city's children, 
meeting at their outer periphery 
the outposts of the other central 
cities, till the people merged and 
coalesced, and the long curving 
roads reached out and joined 
what had been separate, and life 
was good and full, and the pic- 
tures on the wall depicted the 
richness of the harvest. 

The dry prickling of the skin 
began, and with it the cramp that 
was not quite hunger. The death 
had begun. 

The second dream figure went 
to the well. I saw it in white sun- 
light of midday; heavy, slow- 
moving, carrying a pitcher. I saw 
through its eyes. The world was 
black shadow slashed chaotically 
with white darts arid distorted 
images of the world gone mad. 
The parapet was an oval fluid 
form that approached and re- 
ceded as in a delirium. The pack- 
ed ground of the roadway was fire 



THE DREAMING WALL

and each step an eternity. The 
heart’s triple beat surged and 
faded like uneven surf on a gravel 
shore. Life pumped, a waning 
tide. The air was oppressive with 
physical rot. 

Lean on the parapet. Rest. 
Gather strength. Take the rope 
in tendrilous hands. Lean back 
from it. Pull. The creak from the 
pulley is faint and followed by 
seconds of agonized waiting. 
Lean, lean again! The water is 
nearer. The rope burns. The 
heart's beats are exhausted. They 
falter, they flutter . 

The rope no longer burns. The 
skin burns at its memory. The 
pulley screams wildly, the rope 
flails unchecked. 

The ground is hot to knees, to 
belly and face. The splash as the 
bucket strikes the water below is 
a faraway thing without signifi- 
cance. 

The light dims. 

The heart stops. 

The heat begins to die away. 
There is only knowledge: there 
will be no more truth of love and 
giving, of morning clear and cool. 
The lungs will now empty and 
never fill again. 

The breath rasps outward. 

The light goes out. The fire is 
gone. Even sorrow at last dribbles 
out with the last vestige of 
breath. 

I looked down at the body. 

Down into the well. 



I was an onlooker. The artist. 
The past and the present. I was 
the race. 

When the images persisted 
minutes after I realized that my 
eyes were wide open — that I was 
fully awake — I kicked over the 
chair and blundered to the cot. 

H E moaned and made an auto- 
matic but feeble effort to 
push me away. After two min- 
utes of it, I gave up, soaked a 
towel at the washbasin and began 
slapping him in the face with it, 
without any pretense of gentle- 
ness. He came to with a grunt, 
swore unintelligibly through pa- 
ralyzed lips and slacked back 
into sleep. I gave him the towel 
in the face again, yelling. 

Finally he got his eyelids up, 
shoved himself onto one elbow 
and began blinking stupidly at 
the light. I dragged him bodily 
out of the sleeping bag and 
dumped him onto the floor. 

He forced himself back onto 
the cot and sat on the edge, mut- 
tering. I gave him more towel 
treatment. He reared and knock- 
ed the towel from my hand. His 
face was white and fogged, 
strained with the effort of trying 
to wake up. 

“Snap out of it, Major. I’ve 
found something!” 

“Can’t it wait?” 

“No. I know why Collins killed 
himself.”

“You’re dreaming.” 

“Yes! Awake and dreaming. 
And I don’t think I’ve even been 
to sleep.” 

His face hardened, but was 
instantly more alert. He groped 
for cigarettes. I threw him a 
pack. He puffed one alight and 
slumped backward across the cot, 
his shoulders propped against the 
wall behind it. When he looked 
at me again, it was with a glint 
of the old malice, but his mus- 
cular coordination was still off 
and he spoke thickly. 

“I wish you were in my com- 
mand, Beck. It’d be good for my 
soul. Okay . Let’s have it” 

1 GAVE it to him. It was like 
clambering over an eight-foot 
wall, except that the obstacle 
had no set form or substance. It 
weaved and dodged, subtly com- 
manding, fluidly evasive. 

“Collins. We’ve no reason to 
think his experience was any dif- 
ferent from our own. Most likely 
the dreams began his first night, 
too. I don’t know whether any- 
one checked his medical kit, so 
we don’t know whether he tried 
dope or not. Okay?” 

“Well?” 

“Look at the man. He had a 
rough time and his rating took a 
dive. No one likes that. It brings 
them too close to job suspension. 
Collins wasn’t the kind of man 
to go for a rehabilitation period, 



even with full pay. He lived for 
his work. Maybe that helped 
bring on the crisis in the first 
place. Maybe he felt he needed 
the job to pull himself into shape 
again. 

“But you know how the medics 
work. Give them a hint and they 
watch you like a hawk. On his 
last medical, his rating was up, 
but they went on watching him. 
And he went on watching him- 
self. 

“And then, in complete isola- 
tion on an alien planet, the 
dreams. 

“How would you handle it. 
Major? You, with your dead one- 
point-o? You’d get the hell out 
and submit yourself to Medical. 
So would he. So would I, nor- 
mally — if the only alternative 
was to stay and fight it out alone. 
But Collins couldn’t. He couldn’t 
even make radio contact. 

“Imagine the impact of the 
dreams, identical, insistent, re- 
current dreams that kept you 
awake without let-up. A sane 
man would think he’d gone mad. 
Maybe Collins was as ripe for 
that suggestion as a healthy man 
can be. And then, Major, to 
crown it all, when the dreams 
persisted even when he was 
awake — when they grew until 
every second of the day he had 
to fight to keep separate two con- 
current streams of consciousness 
— the one he knew was of his im-

mediate environment and the 
other coming from God knows 
where . • 

“When he couldn’t tell which 
was reality and which the impo- 
sition, Major, he decided he was 
mad and shot himself. That’s 
why he left no record. He didn’t 
want to leave anything that 
would betray his collapse.” 

I took a deep, uneven breath 
and reached for the cigarettes. It 
had come out fast, and I hadn’t 
heard half of what I’d said. I felt 
numb. 

His face was tensed and wary. 
He seemed to weigh what I’d said 
in a balance with myself and my 
sanity. He had been under the 
drug just as far as I had, and I 
know he must be feeling its ef- 
fects as a clogging deterrent to 
clear thinking. But the hard, al- 
most warpedly disciplined mind 
behind the pale eyes sent out a 
gleam of its usual cold light. 

Misted morning with a spring- 
time smell. 

“Now you’re experiencing this 
dual consciousness?” 

“Yes.” 

He got up abruptly and stub- 
bed out his cigarette. He found 
an inch of coffee in the bottom of 
the pot and turned the heat on 
under it. Then he picked up the 
chair I had knocked over and sat 
down. 

“All right, Beck. Suppose I buy 
it. What’s it like?" 



I THOUGHT the words and 
heard my voice, dry and harsh 
with an edged fatigue, and watch- 
ed his face for the tiny ripples of 
expression he allowed to play 
across its surface now and then. 
All the while the inward images 
played around the top of my head 
in all their sharpness and in- 
tensity. 

... The soft green dampness 
rose from the well like a cooling 
balm. Below, the water gleamed, 
the bucket quiet on its surface 
twenty feet away, an age away, 
unreachable. There was a long- 
ing tor water as there might be 
for immortality at the moment 
of death . 

There was a fever that was 
worse than any other in the his- 
tory of the people, and it burned 
in the city like a conflagration 
before it found the roads and 
then ran screaming down them, 
dessicating the villages with its 
breath on its way to ignite the 
city next in line. The mystic 
Trinity of Water, Sun and Soil 
were powerless to stop it, and 
first there was no more gathering 
in the centers, then no more till- 
ing, and the arts of life dried up 
until there was only the waiting, 
the long, agonized, almost end- 
less waiting that was not. endless, 
for the time was nigh . 

The death crawled with the 
sun on my back. I fell, I died, I 
watched another at the well. The 



32

pulley creaked, the bucket rose. 
Slow, jaded muscles ached. 

The bucket stood on the para- 
pet. 

Coolness of water coursed 
down my throat . 

I built a house. It took months. 
I was a father, a child, a mother, 
a plowman. I loved and created. 
There was the good smell of soil 
and green things sprouting, the 
harvest dance and the three spin- 
ning moons. The joy was of liv- 
ing that didn’t know death, and 
the death was the all-denying 
power that negated the living and 
the tide of generations, their art 
and the well, the wall and its 
chronicles relief-cut and colored. 
Time was a plaything, a second, 
a year, a season, a century . 

Events lived and repeated 
without plot or reason. It had all 
the magnificence of detail, the 
truth, the relentless insistence of 
a full-fledged psychosis. I knew 
its reality. And part of me sat 
and talked to Castle and knew it 
for illusion, appraised it and 
knew my appraisal was sane. One 
life was mine: Beck, John Hale, 
Anthropological field man Grade 
2, Medical File #8A-35209. The 
other was the life of a long-dead 
race whose infinite multiplicity 
of individual experience was 
somehow shared. 

— Feel of stone, cool-rough and 
heavy. Smell of mortar clean and 
sharp — 

THE DREAMING WALL 



“T>UT how?" Castle raised his 
U his voice for the first time. 
He was on his feet now, had re- 
commenced the random pacing 
of a couple of hours before. He 
stopped to look down at me 
where I sat on the cot. His fists 
knotted. “How? There must be 
a means, a method — ” 
“Telepathy?” 

“A race of telepaths? You’re 
the Anthro man.” 

“They’ve been recorded. 
Twice.” 

“But, Beck, these are dead! 
They’ve been dead for centuries. 
What are you trying to feed me? 
The identity of ideas and mat- 
ter? The substantial existence of 
thought-forms? Medievalist clap- 
trap like that?” 

“No.” 

“Then what are you getting 
at?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“Let’s get out of here.” 

“But we’ve got to know. If we 
can find some corroboration of 
what I think the natives looked 
like, to prove I’m not hallucinat- 
ing, that there’s some telepathic 
principle involved — ” 

“How’ll you go about it?” 
“We can go through the ruin 
until we find a clear enough carv- 
ing to show us what they looked 
like. The dream images them- 
selves could hold the key to the 
principle. If we hold out long 
enough . 

33 




“Telepathic or not, it might be 
dangerous. Even diseased, in 
spite of Medical.” 

“But it all ties in! The dream 
ideas and images come first to 
the sleeping mind, when con- 
scious control is at a minimum. 
First the harshest — the death — 
and then, slowly, those that pre- 
ceded it. When the brain is final- 
ly dulled and weakened by lack 
of sleep and worry, and conscious 
control becomes less and less a 
factor in waking life, the intru- 
sions take hold there also. We’ve 
got to stay here. And stay awake. 
There’s one piece of evidence we 
don’t have yet.” 

He sat down abruptly, slump- 
ing. Eyes now red and heavy - 
lidded threw me a challenge. 
“And that is?” 

I felt like coming right out and 
saying it. You stuck your neck 
out, Castle. Now you sweat it 
out with me or else. 

What I said was, “You’re not 
immune, Major.” 

He caught the drift. His eye- 
brows rose fractionally. He seem- 
ed about to say something, 
changed his mind and bit it back. 
Finally he got up and said, “All 
right, Beck. We’ll play it your 
way. In the meantime . ” 

He stopped. His face, his tight- 
ly gesturing hand — his total 
being — froze into stunned immo- 
bility. 

I had the sudden sinking con- 



viction that the man was dead. 
It lasted long seconds frozen out 
of time, and then slowly the ri- 
gidity melted into motion. He 
straightened, threw back his 
shoulders and let out a ragged 
breath, staring at me with the 
look of a man under the effects 
of dry, icy shock. He whispered 
something to himself, involun- 
tarily, incredulously, and then 
for a long time did nothing more 
than stand there, wearing that 
look and breathing hard. 

“I was walking down the street 
toward the well,” he said at last. 
“It came— flash — and then it 
went. I was walking down the. .” 

It was the evidence we needed. 
I didn’t realize then that he’d 
actually provided it hours be- 
fore. Nor had I realized the ex- 
tent of my anxiety to have it. 

I got up and apportioned out 
the coffee dregs. 

T PUT down my cup. The wak- 
^ ing dream had receded. 

“The coffee?” Castle asked. 

“Maybe. The coffee stimulates 
to its exclusion, the sedative 
drugs to below the conscious re- 
ceptive level.” 

“Now that I know what it's 
like . Castle said to himself. 
He took a sharp turn about the 
room. “I guess there’ll be more.” 

He dreaded it and I didn’t 
blame him. The night had taken 
its toll. My relief at being corrob-

orated had spent itself in a 
breath, and we were in a state of 
tension that approached the 
breaking point. 

A degree of animation had re- 
placed the major’s usual rigid 
mask. He talked fast, biting off 
the words. But the signs were de- 
ceptive. The drug in his system 
could not have worn off so quick- 
ly. It was fatigue and the fear 
of fatigue and a bad case of the 
jitters that kept him wound up. 
I guessed how desperately he 
wanted to sleep, just as I had 
when my waking shift began — 
still did, for that matter — but 
sleep was forbidden and a thing 
of fear, and his mind was caught 
in the cross purpose. 

He began to pace endlessly, 
guessing, extrapolating, obsessed 
by the malignant possibilities of 
the dream phenomena. Hidden 
intelligence, he said. Induced in- 
sanity . We had to stay awake. 

Dust of harvest dry and golden 
in the nostrils. 

Smoke from my cigarette 
climbed in a ragged, formless 
stream. The major’s voice be- 
came a drone, a deadly burning 
in the eyes the one thing I was 
fully conscious of. The dream 
tugged at my nerves, and the 
image of the ruin, magically re- 
built, rose and crystallized behind 
my forehead. Moonset. Smell of 
sunrise cool, smell of death . 

There was a message I knew 



would come. It had to come: a 
meeting of minds and emotions 
that carried the final crystal seg- 
ment of the puzzle without which 
the picture was distortion beyond 
meaning. It might come settling 
like a cloud of dust, simple in- 
tuitive knowledge transcending 
understanding. Or a word. Or the 
accidental relocation of a mis- 
placed fact. 

It was the sheerest chance that 
when it came, it came to us si- 
multaneously. 

VjfTHAT it was that prompted 
»» that sprawling, amorphous, 
mindless thing to spew out what 
it did — eject it with a force that 
exploded in identical patterns on 
the latent receptivity complexes 
of two separate sentient beings — 
is a problem for the student of 
alien biology and neural physics. 
As it was, it came full-throated 
and screaming, embodying ev- 
erything that rejects death and 
the annihilation of self as incom- 
prehensibly foreign to the mind, 
anathema, the ultimate incom- 
patible — 

It brought me off the cot and 
onto my feet dry-throated and 
conscious of a clamoring pit 
where my heart and viscera 
should be. Castle’s face was the 
color of dirty snow. 

“I heard it. You heard it, Beck. 
The scream that woke me the 
first time.”

“Last night. The noise I made 
when I came out of it last night.” 
“But last night — !” 

“The telepathic medium still 
operates.” 

“Did we hear it? Through au- 
ditory channels?” 

“I doubt it.” 

“Where can it come from?” 

I shrugged, sweating. 

“Beck, if it picked up your 
voice, or the mental impression of 
your voice . .” 

The implication sank in slowly. 
It — whatever it was — could pick 
a cry and the emotion behind it 
out. of the night, store it, hold it 
intact, to discharge it under what 
plan or compulsion there was no 
way to know. It had held the life 
and death of a race. Any second 
might carry a spurt of despair 
and the subjective explosion of a 
bullet through the palate, the 
final spasmodic neural wrench 
that was the death of Collins. 

Castle’s tongue flickered over 
dry lips. Glistening moisture ran 
down his temple, swerved onto 
his cheek and coursed to his jaw- 
line to hang there, brightly. He 
had almost stopped breathing and 
the room was cold light and 
shadow without sound. Into the 
silence, or into some goaded sub- 
fabric woven between unknown 
cortical interstices, what came 
next was soft, whimpering, barely 
audible, like a child in the night. 
“ They're dying! There’s a fever

and the whole race is dying . 
Collins’ voice. 

“Outside. Let’s go.” 

C ASTLE raked the gun from 
the folds of his sleeping bag 
and followed me into the soft 
moonlit night. We blundered once 
around the prefab, trigger-nerved. 
The hill rolled down to the ruin. 
Feet away the massive wall frag- 
ment reared dark and quiet. The 
planet lay in quiet, receptive 
silence. 

“No use,” Castle whispered. 
“The ‘hearing’ is illusion. It’s in- 
side your head.” 

“A telepathic faculty could be 
directional, like any other sense. 
I got direction.” 

“But— where?” 

“I don’t know, now.” I let out 
a long breath. 

“Let’s go back inside.” 

Smell of morning. Smell of 
death. 

“Okay.” 

He poked his gun through the 
door of the prefab before re- 
entering. I followed him inside. 
He hung onto the gun as though 
it alone could anchor him to 
sanity. 

“Well?” he said tightly. 
“They’re dying,” Collins' 
whimper said again, and this time 
even Castle sensed direction. 

It transformed him into a sin- 
gle-purpose machine. I had time 
to yell “No!” just once, and threw 



myself down and out of the line 
of fire. 

His first shot took the door. 
Plastic shivers hurled by the force 
of the exploding bullet scattered 
about. The second shot took the 
door off its hinges. It was still 
falling when the gun bucked 
again. Outside fire blossomed a 
millisecond later. 

He kept it up until the gun was 
empty, firing from a balanced 
half-crouch, his set face glisten- 
ing, the double explosions repeat- 
ing themselves beyond shock to 
the point of monotony. 

And then there was silence. 
Into it an echo rolled like half- 
heard thunder and was gone. 
Smoke limped from the remains 
of the door and one corner of 
the prefab. The reek was corro- 
sive. 

There was no sound, in ear or 
mind . 

No images behind the eyes. 

TT was as though burrowing 
A alien roots had been snatched 
from the brain, dragging with 
them their poisonous cilia of 
fatigue and disruption. It was a 
violent gust and a burst of pure 
sunlight in a chamber of mil- 
dewed horror. The realization of 
refound freedom was momentari- 
ly stunning. 

The crumbling wall. 

There was the clue. 

I got to my feet with the sick- 



38 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




ening fear that Castle had killed 
the chance of a thousand life- 
times. I blundered past him into 
the open air, heard him crunch- 
ing over the remains of the door 
behind me. He came up, breath- 
ing heavily, not speaking. 

The wall lay squat and dis- 
located under the three moons. 
The unreasoned ferocity of Cas- 
tle’s artillery had inflicted more 
than superficial havoc. Deep 
cracks starred across its surface. 

“The damage is done. We 
might as well go the limit.” 

“It looks weak enough, Beck.” 

Castle dropped his gun. We got 
our combined weight .against the 
wall, over three hundred and sixty 
pounds of good sinew. We dug in 
and pushed. 

Its last-ditch token of resist- 
ance ended in a scraping crackle, 
a series of minutely brittle splin- 
terings . and then the whole 
structure gave, cracked further, 
moved, and suddenly toppled in 
shards and great chunks and a 
dry thunder of sound. 

We stood, panting, looking at 
it. 

All that remained was a stubby 
fragment. From its surface, wisps 
of steam and a faint sweet smoke 
curled up. Everywhere — clustered 
in pools and tiny pinpricks, join- 
ed and communicating through 
the porosities of the rock matrix 
— patches of a pale, gelatinous 
substance flickered impersonally 



in the white light of the moons. 
The odor was of scorched organic 
matter. 

“It’s alive,” Castle said in a 
bewildered husk. “The wall’s 
alive!” 

That wasn’t true, but it was 
close enough. I gave him a nod, 
and for a while neither of us 
spoke. 

The wall. 

The crumbling wall. 

The eroded, perforated, ea fen- 
out wall. 

Finally I said, “Reload, Major. 
We’ll try to find how deep it 
goes.” 

E never did. 

It didn’t matter. We could 
find out later. What did matter 
was that we had found what we 
were looking for. It explained the 
haunting difference, the evocative 
magic of the ruin; anchored the 
pervading half-known memories 
that clung to the air like invisible 
mist. It might take an army 
culled from every sub-branch of 
science to pin down the details, 
but we had all we needed. 

Castle said into the micro- 
phone, “Foregoing report by Beck 
hereby confirmed. Ends. Castle, 
Major.” 

“Yes, sir,” Donovan said. “Will 
there be anything else, sir?” 
“No.” 

“Get the lead out, Donovan,” 
I said. “Send that beetle out. 



THE DREAMING WALL 



39 




See you in the morning. Have 
some liquor handy.” 

“Sure, Johnny.” 

I killed both the speaker and 
the transmitter and leaned back 
to enjoy the look on Castle’s face. 
I didn’t, though. After measur- 
able seconds he said tiredly, “Will 
you never learn, Beck? Standard 
sign-off procedure wasn’t set up 
as a matter of courtesy . .” 
“Relax, Major.” 

I grinned at him, wondering 
about the wording of the report 
he had filed earlier that night. I 
wished I had another pint of 
brandy so I could offer him a 
drink. His flat, slaty look returned 
— and left. He dropped onto the 
cot, swung his feet up and 
stretched out, staring at the ceil- 
ing. 

“They won’t be here till dawn. 
I hope it’s over.” 

“That’s what worries me : it 
might be over. Look at it from 
Anthro’s viewpoint.” 

He didn’t say anything. I left 
him lying on the cot and went out 
to look at my job and the havoc 
the explosive bullets had caused. 
The moons had paled. The stars 
were fading. Over the farthest 
rise beyond the ruin, the sky was 
turning a pearly, unclouded gray. 
Quite faint now, the combined 
acridity and the cloying, sweet 
scorched smell rose from the 
blasted gash in the hillside where 
the wall had stood. 



O NE more fact to feed into the 
computers’ memory banks. 
We had blasted the wall and 
found the organism extending 
through bedrock. How far it went 
was anybody’s guess. It appeared 
to subsist on the chemical com- 
ponents of the rock’s composi- 
tion — or whatever other medium 
it could inhabit — drawing away 
from leached out areas that 
could no longer support it to 
leave the characteristic honey- 
comb effect. 

Would Hanson report the 
dreams tonight? Tomorrow? 
Ever? And what about the 
others? 

“Imagine a being,” I’d said 
when Donovan recorded my re- 
ports. “A featureless being, non- 
intelligent, composed of non-spe- 
cialized cells clumped in smaller 
or larger aggregations.” That 
wasn’t hard. It was a simple form 
of life common in all explored 
sections of the Galaxy. But then 
where? How well did the “non- 
specialized” description fit? Be- 
cause there remained the one 
trait that was peculiarly the or- 
ganism’s own. “Hypothesis: that 
telepathic projection is a modu- 
lation of electrical impulses gene- 
rated in the cortex. That these 
are recorded, analogously with 
magnetic recording, in some fab- 
ric of the organism’s total struc- 
ture or unit part, or by modifica- 
tion of cellular or other unit 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




structure as in crystal recording.” 
I didn’t know. Turn that prob- 
lem over to the medics and phys- 
icists. Hypothesis . 

To hell with hypotheses. I was 
too tired. Some day maybe we 
would learn what determined the 
strength of re-emanation of a 
particular thought or image — or 
would it be conditions leading to 
selective reception? — and wheth- 
er an interchange of imprisoned 
sense data between one area and 
another or virtual cellular im- 
mortality explained the retention 
of impressions over ten or twenty 
or fifty thousand Earth years. 
Until then the bare fact must suf- 
fice: Fallon’s planet had devel- 
oped an entity that was, no more 
and no less, a telepathic recorder 
with its own indiscriminate play- 
back. 

One more problem roughly 
stated. 



Alien life! I thought a little 
fuzzily, standing there with the 
coolness of dawn seeping like a 
balm under my shirt to soothe the 
tired, cramped muscles . 

I started violently. 

Harvest time. Morning smell 
with dew and grasses underfoot. 

It was faint, elusive as the 
after-image of a quick, bright 
light. 

The heart’s triple beat came 
from a great distance, but it was 
strong and vital. 

Undisturbed, the city dreamed 
its ancient dreams. 

I relaxed, grinned down at it. 
We were going to have to train 
the Anthro squad in a new meth- 
od of investigation. I sat down 
in the rubble to enjoy the wait 
for the beetle. 

The city was a hub, the center 
of a circle of life . ,

The Aggravation of Elmer 

By ROBERT ARTHUR 

The world would beat a path to 
Elmer's door— but he had to go 
catiy the door along with him ! 



I T WAS the darnedest traffic 
jam I’d ever seen in White 
Plains. For two blocks ahead 
of me, Main Street was gutter to 
gutter with stalled cars, trucks 
and buses. 

If I hadn’t been in such a hurry 
to get back to the shop, I might 
have paid more attention. I might 
have noticed nobody was leaning 
on his horn. Or that at least a 
quarter of the drivers were out 
peering under their hoods. 

But at the time it didn’t regis- 
ter. I gave the tieup a passing 
glance and was turning up the 
side street toward Biltom Elec- 

lllustraled by CAVAT 



tronics — Bill-Tom, get it? — 
when I saw Marge threading her 
way to the curb. She was leading 
a small blonde girl of about 
eight, who clutched a child-size 
hatbox in her hand. Marge was 
hot and exasperated, but small 
fry was as cool and composed as 
a vanilla cone. 

I waited. Even flushed and 
disheveled, Marge is a treat to 
look at. She is tall and slender, 
with brown eyes that match her 
hair, a smile that first crinkles 
around her eyes, then sneaks 
down and becomes a full-fledged 
grin — 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




But I’m getting off the subject. 

“Honestly, Bill!” Marge said 
as she saw me. “The traffic now- 
adays! We’ve been tied up for 
fifteen minutes. I finally decided 
to get off the bus and walk, even 
though it is about a hundred in 
the shade.” 

“Come along to the shop,” I 
suggested. “The reception room 
is air-conditioned and you can 
watch the world’s first baseball 
game telecast in color. The Giants 
versus the Dodgers, Carl Erskine 
pitching.” 

Marge brightened. “That’ll be 
more fun than shopping, won’t 
it, Doreen?” she asked, looking 
down at the kid. “Bill, this is 
Doreen. She lives across the street 
from me. Her mother’s at the 
dentist and I said I’d look after 
her for the day.” 

“Hello, Doreen,” I said. “What 
have you in the hatbox? Doll 
clothes?” 

Doreen gave me a look of faint 
disgust. “No,” she piped, in a 
high treble. “An unhappy genii.” 

“An unhappy — ” I did a 
double take. “Oh, an unhappy 
genii? Maybe he’s unhappy be- 
cause you won’t let him out, ha 
ha.” Even to myself, I sounded 
idiotic. 

Doreen looked at me pityingly. 
“It’s not a he, it’s a thing. Elmer 
made it.” 

I knew when I was losing, so I 
quit. 



T HURRIED Marge and Doreen 

along toward our little two- 
story building. Once we got into 
the air-conditioned reception 
room, Marge sank down grate- 
fully onto the settee and I switch- 
ed on the television set with the 
big 24-inch tube Tom had built. 

Biltom Electronics makes TV 
components, computer parts, 
things like that. Tom Kennedy 
is the brains. Me, Bill Rawlins, 
I do the legwork, and tend to the 
business details. 

“It’s uncanny the way all those 
cars suddenly stopped when our 
bus broke down,” Marge said as 
we waited for the picture to come 
on. “Any day now this civiliza- 
tion of ours will get so compli- 
cated a bus breaking down some- 
place will bring the whole thing 
to a halt. Then where will we 
be?” 

“Elmer says silly-zation is 
doomed!” Doreen put in hap- 
pily. 

The way she rolled the word 
out made me stare at her. 

Marge only nodded. “That’s 
what Elmer says, all right,” she 
agreed, a trifle grim. 

“Why does Elmer say silly- 
zation is doomed?” I asked Dor- 
een. 

“Because it’s getting hotter.” 
The kid gave it to me straight. 
“All the ice at the North Pole is 
gonna melt. The ocean is gonna 
rise two hundred feet. Then ev- 



THE AGGRAVATION OF ELMER 



43 




erybody who doesn’t live on a 
hill is gonna be drownded. That’s 
what Elmer says and Elmer isn’t 
ever wrong.” 

Doreen they called her! Why 
not Cassandra? The stuff kids 
spout these days! 

I gave her a foolish grin. I 
wanted Marge to get the idea I 
was really a family man at heart. 
“That’s very interesting, Doreen. 
Now look, there’s the baseball 
game. Let’s watch, shall we?” 

We weren’t very late after all. 
It was the top half of the second 
inning, the score one to one, Er- 
skine in trouble with two men on 
and only one down. The colors 
were beautiful. Marge and I were 
just settling back to watch when 
Doreen wrinkled her nose. 

“I saw that game yesterday!” 
she announced. 

“You couldn’t have, sweet- 
heart,” I told her. “Because it’s 
only being played today. The 
world’s first ball game ever 
broadcast in color.” 

“There was a game on Elmer’s 
TV,” Doreen insisted. “The pic- 
ture was bigger and the colors 
prettier, too.” 

“Absolutely impossible.” I was 
a little sore. I hate kids who tell 
fibs. “There never was a game 
broadcast in color before. And, 
anyway, you won’t find a color 
tube this big any place outside 
of a laboratory.” 

“But it’s true, Bill.” Marge 



looked at me, wide-eyed. “Elmer 
only has a little seven-inch black 
and white set his uncle gave him. 
But he’s rigged up some kind of 
lens in front of it, and it projects 
a big color picture on a white 
screen.” 

I saw that she was serious. My 
eyes bugged slightly. “Listen,” I 
said, “who is this Elmer charac- 
ter? I want to meet him!” 

“He’s my cousin from South 
America,” Doreen answered. “He 
thinks grownups are stupid.” She 
turned to Marge. “I have to go 
to the bathroom,” she said 
primly. 

“Through that door.” Marge 
pointed. 

Doreen trotted out, clutching 
her hat box. 

“17LMER thinks grownups are 
stupid?” I howled. “Listen, 
how old is this character who 
says silly-zation is doomed and 
can convert a black and white 
broadcast into color?” 

“He’s thirteen,” Marge told 
me. I goggled at her. “Thirteen,” 
she repeated. “His father is some 
South American scientist. His 
mother died ten years ago.” 

I sat down beside her. I lit a 
cigarette. My hands were shak- 
ing. “Tell me about him. All 
about him.” 

“Why, I don’t know very 
much,” Marge said. “Last year 
Elmer was sick, some tropic dis- 



THE AGGRAVATION OF ELMER 



45 




ease. His father sent him up here 
to recuperate. Now Alice — that’s 
his aunt, Doreen’s mother' — is at 
her wits’ end, he makes her so 
nervous,” 

I lit another cigarette before I 
realized I already had one. “And 
he invents things? A bby genius? 
Young Tom Edison and all 
that?” 

Marge frowned. “I suppose 
you could say that,” she con- 
ceded. “He has the garage full of 
stuff he’s made or bought with 
the allowance his father sends 
him. And if you come within ten 
feet of it without permission, you 
get an electric shock right out 
of thin air. But that’s only part 
of it. It — ” she gave a helpless 
gesture — “it’s Elmer’s effect on 
everybody. Everybody over fif- 
teen, that is. He sits there, a little, 
dark, squinched-up kid wearing 
thick glasses and talking about 
how climatic changes inside fifty 
years will flood half the world, 
cause the collapse of civiliza- 
tion — ” 

“Wait a minute!” I cut in. 
“Scientists seem to think that’s 
possible in a few thousand years. 
Not fifty.” 

“Elmer says fifty,” Marge 
stated flatly. “From the way he 
talks, I suspect he’s figured out a 
way to speed things up and is 
going to try it some day just to 
see if it works. Meanwhile he 
fools around out there in the gar- 

46 



age, sneering about the billions 
of dollars spent to develop color 
TV. He says his lens will turn 
any ordinary broadcast into color 
for about twenty-five dollars. He 
says it’s typical of the muddled 
thinking of our so-called scien- 
tists — I’m quoting now — to do 
everything backward and over- 
look fundamental principles.” 

“Bro-ther!” I said. 

Doreen came trotting back in 
then, with her hat box. “I’m tired 
of that game,” she said, giving 
the TV set a bored glance. And 
as she said it the tube went dark. 
The sound cut off. 

“Damn!” I swore. “Must be a 
power failure !” I grabbed the 
phone and jiggled the hook. No 
dice. The phone was dead, too. 

“You’re funny,” Doreen gig- 
gled. “It’s just the unhappy 
genii. See?” 

£>he flicked over the catch on 
the hatbox. 

And the picture came back on. 
The sound started up. “ — swings 
and misses for strike two!” The 
air conditioner began to hum. 

Marge and I stared. Mouths 
open. Wide. 

“VTOU did that, Doreen?” I 
asked it very carefully. “You 
made the television stop and 
start again?” 

“The unhappy genii did,” Dor- 
een told me. “Like this.” She 
flicked the catch back. The TV 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




picture blacked out. The sound 
stopped in the middle of a word. 
The air conditioner whispered 
into silence. 

Then she flipped the catch the 
other way. 

“ — fouls the second ball into 
the screen,” the announcer said. 
Picture okay. Air conditioner 
operating. Everything normal ex- 
cept my pulse and respiration. 

‘‘Doreen, sweetheart — ” I took 
a step toward her — “what’s in 
that box? What is an unhappy 
genii?” 

“Not unhappy.” You know 
how scornful an eight-year-old 
can be? Well, she was. “Unhap- 
pen. It makes things unhappen. 
Anything that works by electra- 
city, it stops. Elmer calls it his 
unhappen genii. Just for fun.” 

“Oh, now I get it,” I said 
brightly. “It makes electricity 
not work — unhappen. Like tele- 
vision sets and air conditioners 
and automobiles and bus en- 
gines.” 

Doreen giggled. 

Marge sat bolt upright. “Dor- 
een! You caused that traffic jam? 
You and that — that gadget of 
Elmer’s?” 

Doreen nodded. “It made all 
the automobile engines stop, just 
like Elmer said. Elmer’s never 
wrong.” 

Marge looked at me. I looked 
at Marge. 

“A field of some kind,” I said. 



“A field that prevents an electric 
current from flowing. Meaning 
no combustion motor using an 
electric spark can operate. No 
electric motors. No telephones. 
No radio or TV.” 

“Is that important?” Marge 
asked. 

“Important?” I yelled. “Think 
of the possibilities just as a wea- 
pon! You could blank out a 
whole nation’s transportation, its 
communications, its industry — ” 

I got hold of myself. I smiled 
my best I -love-children smile. 
“Doreen,” I said, “let me look at 
Elmer’s unhappen genii.” 

The kid clutched the box. 

“Elmer told me not to let any- 
body look at it. He said he’d 
statuefy me if I did. He said no- 
body would understand it any- 
way. He said he might show it 
to Mr. Einstein, but not anybody 
else.” 

“That’s Elmer, all right,” 
Marge muttered. 

I found myself breathing hard. 
I edged toward Doreen and put 
my hand on the hatbox. “Just 
one quick look, Doreen,” I said. 
“No one will ever know.” 

She didn’t answer. Just pulled 
the box away. 

I pulled it back. 

She pulled. 

I pulled. 

“Bill — ” Marge called wam- 
ingly. Too late. The lid of the 
hatbox came off in my hands. 



THE AGGRAVATION OF ELMER 



47 




T HERE was a bright flash, the 
smell of insulation burning, 
and the unhappen genii fell out 
and scattered all over the floor. 

Doreen looked smug. “Now 
Elmer will be angry at you. May- 
be he’ll disintegrate you. Or pa- 
ralalize you and statuefy you. 
Forever.” 

“He might at that, Bill,” 
Marge shuddered. “I wouldn’t 
put anything past him.” 

I wasn’t listening. I was scram- 
bling after the mess of tubes, 
condensers and power packs scat- 
tered over the rug. Some of them 
were still wired together, but most 
of them had broken loose. Elmer 
was certainly one heck of a slop- 
py workman. Hadn’t even sol- 
dered the connections. Just 
twisted the wires together. 

I looked at the stuff in my 
hands. It made as much sense as 
a radio run over by a truck. 

“We’ll take it back to Elmer,” 
I told Doreen, speaking very 
carefully. “I’ll give him lots of 
money to build another. He can 
come down here and use our 
shop. We have lots of nice equip- 
ment he’d like.” 

Doreen tossed her head. “I 
don’t think he’ll wanta. He‘11 be 
mad at you. Anyway, Elmer is 
busy working on aggravation 
now.” 

“That’s for sure!” Marge said 
in heartfelt tones. 

“Aggravation, eh?” I grinned 



like an idiot. “Well, well! I’ll bet 
he’s good at it. But let’s go see 
him right away.” 

“Bill!” Marge signaled me to 
one side. “Maybe you’d better 
not try to see Elmer,” she whis- 
pered. “I mean, if he can build 
a thing like this in his garage, 
maybe he can build a disinteg- 
rator or a paralysis ray or some- 
thing. There’s no use taking 
chances.” 

“You read too many comics,” 
I laughed it off. “He’s only a kid, 
isn’t he? What do you think he 
is? A superman?” 

“Yes,” Marge said flatly. 

“Look, Marge!” I said in fever- 
ish excitement. “I’ve got to talk 
to Elmer! I’ve got to get the 
rights to that TV color lens and 
this electricity interruptor and 
anything else he may have de- 
veloped!” 

Marge kept trying to protest, 
but I simply grabbed her and 
Doreen and hustled them out to 
my car. Doreen lived in a wood- 
ed, hilly section a little north of 
White Plains. I made it in ten 
minutes. 

1V1"ARGE had said Elmer work- 
ed in the garage. I kept 
going up the driveway, swung 
sharp around the big house — and 
slammed on the brakes. 

Marge screamed. 

We skidded to a stop with our 
front end hanging over what 



48 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




looked like a bomb crater in the 
middle of the driveway. 

I swallowed my heart down 
again, while I backed away fast. 

We had almost plunged into a 
hole forty feet across and twenty 
feet deep in the middle. The hole 
was perfectly round, like a half 
section of a grapefruit. 

“What’s this?” I asked. 
“Where’s the garage?” 

“That’s where the garage 
should be.” Marge looked dazed. 
“But it’s gone!” 

I took another look at that 
hole scooped out with geomet- 
rical precision, and turned to 
Doreen. “What did you say El- 
mer was working on?” 

“Agg — ” she sobbed, “agg — 
agg — aggravation.” She began to 
bawl in earnest. “Now he’s gone. 
He’s mad. He won’t ever come 
back, I betcha.” 

“That’s a fact,” I muttered. 
“He may not have been mad, but 
he certainly was aggravated. 
Marge, listen! This is a mystery. 



We’ve just got to let it stay a 
mystery. We don’t know any- 
thing, understand? The cops will 
finally decide Elmer blew him-

every time he fails he takes it 
out on me because I didn’t get to 
Elmer sooner. But you can see 
perfectly well he’s way off base,

THE AGGRAVATION OF ELMER

J UST ahead of us, we saw a 
cluster of smoke trees sud- 
denly quiver, though there 
wasn’t a whisper of a breeze, and 
begin to emit clouds of dense yel- 
low vapor from their trembling 
branch tips. 

“Let’s get a move on, Will,” 
said Jack Demaree. His voice 
was thin and piercing, like the 
thin air all about us. “It’s going 
to get really hot here in the next 
twenty minutes.” 

The steel and glass town of 
Niobe was visible a quarter mile 
ahead. “Sure,” I said, and chang- 
ed pace. We had been shambling 
along lazily, in the effort-saving 
walk you learn to use in your 
first week on Mars. I stepped it 
up to the distance-devouring 
loose run that’s possible only on 
a light-gravity planet like Mars. 

It’s tough to have to run in a 
very thin atmosphere. Your lungs 
work too hard : you feel as though 
every step is going to be your 
last — except that by day the 
temperature is high, and the light 
gravity lets you stand effort that 
would otherwise kill you. 

But we hadn’t much choice. 
The smoke trees had passed their 
critical point, and the curious 
gelatinous sulphur compounds 
that served them for sap had 
turned into gaseous heat. When 
that happened, it meant that the 
sun was nearly overhead ; and

with only Mars's thin blanket of 
air to shield you, you do not stay 
out in the open at high noon. 

Not that we needed to see the 
smoke trees to know it was get- 
ting hot. A hundred and twenty 
in the shade it was, at least. If 
there had been any shade. 

Demaree passed me with a 
spurt just as we reached the out- 
skirts of Niobe, and I followed 
him into the pressure chamber of 
the General Mercantile office. We 
use helium in our synthetic at- 
mosphere in one big ear-popping 
dose, without any danger of the 
bends we might have got from 
nitrogen. I swallowed and rubbed 
my ears; then we shed our sand- 
capes and respirators and walked 
into the anteroom. 

Keever peered out of his pri- 
vate office, his lean horse-face 
sagging with curiosity. 

"‘Demaree and Wilson report- 
ing,” I sdid. “No sign of natives. 
No hostile action. No anything, 
in fact, except heat.” 

Keever nodded and pulled his 
head back in. “Make out a slip,” 
his voice floated out. “And go 
out again in two hours. Better 
eat.” 

Demaree finished shaking the 
loose sand out of his cape into a 
refuse shaft and made a face. 
“Two hours! Oh, lord.” But he 
followed me to the company 
cafeteria without putting up any 
argument. 



T HE first thing we both did 
was make a dash for the 
drinking fountain. I won, and 
sopped up my fill while Dema- 
ree’s dry and covetous breath 
seared the back of my neck. Sand 
patrol can dehydrate a man close 
to the point of shock in three 
hours; we had been out for four. 
You see why we were taking it 
easy? 

We sat down in the little booth 
where we had put aside our card 
game with Bolt and Farragut a 
few hours before and Marianna, 
without waiting for our order, 
brought coffee and sandwiches. 
Her eyes were hooded and un- 
happy. Nerves, I thought, and 
tried to catch Demaree’s eye. But 
it didn’t work. 

He said in his customary slow 
and biting drawl, “Why, Mary, 
you’re getting stupider than ever. 
You took away our cards. I 
swear, girl, I don’t know why the 
Company keeps you — ” 

He trailed off as she looked 
straight at him, and then turned 
away. 

“You won’t need them,” she 
said after a moment. “Farragut’s 
patrol got it this morning.” 
Farragut and Bolt, Cortland 
and VanCaster. Four good men, 
and it was the same old story. 
Their patrol rqnged far beyond 
the defense perimeter of Niobe; 
they had got caught too far from 
town before it got really hot, and 



52 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




it was a choice between staying 
in their cached sandcar or get- 
ting stuck enroute in the noon- 
day sun. They had elected the 
sandcar and something bright 
and hot had come flashing over 
a sand dune and incinerated men 
and car alike. 

The hell of it all was none of 
us had ever seen any of the 
Martians. 

The earliest expeditions had 
reported that there wasn’t any 
life on Mars at all, barring the 
tiny ratlike forms that haunted 
the sparse forests of the North. 
Then air reconnaissance had re- 
ported creatures about the size 
of men, more or less, that stood 
up like men, that built villages of 
huts. 

But air reconnaissance was se- 
verely limited by the thinness of 
Mars’s air; helicopters and wing- 
ed aircraft simply did not work, 
except at speeds so high that it 
was nearly impossible to make 
out details. It wasn’t until one 
of the orbiting mother spacecraft, 
after launching its space-to- 
ground shuttle rockets and stand- 
ing by for the return, spent a 
dozen revolutions mapping Mars’s 
surface that the first really good 
look at the Martians and their 
works was available. 

Well, let’s say as good as you 
could expect, considering the 
mother ship was five hundred 
miles up. 



TT WAS easy enough to send a 

surface party to investigate the 
Martian villages; but they were 
empty by the time Earthmen got 
there. Our sandcars could move 
faster than a Martian afoot, but 
it wasn’t healthy to use a sand- 
car. Somehow, what weapons the 
Martians found to use against us 
(and nothing resembling a wea- 
pon had ever been found in the 
deserted villages) seemed most 
effective against machines. It was 
flatly impossible that they should 
have electronic aimers to zero in 
on the radio-static from the ma- 
chines; but if it had been possible, 
it would have been certain — for 
that was the effect. 

I had plenty of time to think 
about all this as Demaree and I 
ate our glum and silent meal. 
There just wasn’t anything much 
for us to say. Farragut and Bolt 
had been friends of ours. 

Demaree sighed and put down 
his coffee. Without looking at me, 
he said, “Maybe I ought to quit 
this job. Will.” 

I didn’t answer; and he let 
it go. I didn’t think he meant it, 
but I knew how he felt. 

General Mercantile was a 
good enough outfit to work for, 
and its minerals franchise on 
Mars meant a terrific future for 
any young fellow who got in oh 
the ground floor. That’s what ev- 
erybody said, back on Earth, and 
that’s what kept us all there— 



THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE 



53 




the allegedly brilliant future. 

That and the adventure of de- 
veloping a new whole world. I 
suppose those old Englishmen 
who went out for the Hudson 
Bay Company and the East In- 
dia Company and other Middle- 
Ages monopolies must have had 
the same feeling. 

And the same dangers. Except 
that they dealt with an enemy 
they could see and understand; 
an enemy that, regardless of skin 
color or tongue, was human. And 
we were fighting shadows. 

I tasted my coffee and it was 
terrible. “Hey, Mary — ” I started, 
but I never finished. 

The alarm klaxon squawked 
horrifyingly in the cafeteria; we 
could hear it bellowing all over 
the GM building. We didn’t wait 
to ask questions; we jumped up 
and raced for the door, Demaree 
colliding with me as we tried to 
beat each other through. He 
clutched at me and looked at me 
blankly, then elbowed me aside. 
Over his shoulder he said, “Hey, 
Will — I don’t really want to 
quit . 

HE news was : Kelcy. 

Kelcy was our nearest vil- 
lage, and the Martians had 
schlagged it. Demaree and I were 
the first in the Ready Room, and 
Keever snapped that much in- 
formation at us while we were 
waiting the few seconds for the 



rest of the patrols to come rac- 
ing in. They had been in other 
buildings and came leaping in 
still wearing their sand capes; 
they had had to race across the 
blindingly hot streets in the mid- 
day Martian glare. 

The whole station complement, 
less the four who had been lost 
that morning, left twelve of us. 
We were on the books as person- 
nel assistants; however, we were 
actually guards, the entire trou- 
ble-shooting force and peace-and- 
order officers for the town of 
Niobe. 

Keever repeated it for the 
others. “They attacked Kelcy 
thirty minutes ago. It was a hit- 
and-run raid; they fired on all 
but one of the buildings, and ev- 
ery building was demolished. So 
far, they report twenty-six sur- 
vivors. There might be a couple 
more — out in the open; that’s all 
that are in the one remaining 
building.” Out in the open and 
it was just past high noon — 

Big, fair-haired Tom van der 
Gelt unsteadily shredded the 
plastic from a fresh pack of cig- 
arettes. “I had a brother in 
Kelcy,” he remarked quietly. 

“We don’t have a list of sur- 
vivors yet,” Keever said quickly. 
“Maybe your brother’s all right. 
But we’ll find out soon, because 
we’re going to send a relief ex- 
pedition.” 

We all sat up at that. Relief 



54 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




expedition? But Kelcy was forty 
miles away. We could never hope 
to walk it, or even run it, between 
the end of the hot-period and 
dark; and it made no sense for 
us to be out in the open at the 
dusk sandstorm. 

But Keever continued. “This 
is the first time they’ve attacked 
a town. I don’t have to tell you 
how serious it is. Niobe may be 
next. So we must go there, get 
the survivors back here, and see 
if we can find out anything from 
them. And because we won’t have 
much time, we’re going to travel 
by sandcar.” 

There was a silence in that 
room for a moment, while the 
echo “sandcar” bounced around. 
Only the echo made it sound like 
suicide. 

Keever coughed. “It’s a calcu- 
lated risk,” he went on doggedly. 
“I’ve gone over every skirmish 
report since the first landings, 
and never — well, almost never — 
have the Martians done more 
than hit and run. Now, it’s true 
that this is the first time they’ve 
come out against a town — maybe 
they’re changing their tactics. 

“I won’t try to tell you that 
this is safe. It isn’t. But there’s 
at least a chance that we’ll get 
through— more of a chance, say, 
than the twenty-six survivors in 
Kelcy have if we don’t try it.” 
He hesitated for a second. Then, 
slowly, “I won’t order any man 

THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE 



to do it. But I’ll call for volun- 
teers. Anybody who wants to give 
it a try, front and center.” 
Nobody made a mad rush to 
get up there — it still sounded like 
suicide to all of us. 

But nobody stayed behind. In 
less than a minute, we were all 
standing huddled around Keever, 
listening to orders. 

W E had to wait another forty 
minutes. It took time for 
the maintenance crew to get the 
sandcars out of their hideaways, 
where they’d been silently stand- 
ing — not even rusting in the dry 
Martian air — since the first 
Earthman drew the connection 
between sandcars and Martian 
attack. Besides, it was still hot 
and, even in the sandcars, it 
would help for the sun to be a 
few degrees past the meridian. 

There were fourteen of us in 
three cars — the patrols, Keever 
and Dr. Solveig. Solveig’s the 
only doctor in Niobe, but Keever 
requisitioned him — we didn’t 
know what we might find in Kel- 
cy. Keever’s car led the party; 
Demaree, Solveig and I were in 
the last, the smallest of the lot 
and the slowest. 

Still, we clipped off fifteen 
miles of the forty-mile trip in 
eight minutes. The cats were 
flapping until I was sure they 
would fly off the drive wheels, 
but somehow they held on as we 



55 




roared over the rolling sand. 

It sounded as though the car 
was coming to pieces at every 
bump— a worrisome sound but 
not, I think, the sound that any 
of us was really worrying about. 
That sound was the rushing, 
roaring thunder of a Martian 
missile leaping at us over a dune ; 
and none of us expected to hear 
it more than once . 

The way to Kelcy skirts what 
we call the Split Cliffs, which all 
of us regarded as a prime suspect 
for a Martian hangout. There 
had been expeditions into the 
Split Cliffs because of that sus- 
picion; but most of them came 
back empty - handed, having 
found nothing but an incredible 
tangle. However, the ones that 
didn’t come back empty-handed 
didn’t come back at all; it was, as 
I say, a prime suspect. And so we 
watched it warily until it was al- 
most out of sight behind us. 

Martians or none, the Split 
Cliffs is a treacherous place, with 
nothing worth an Earthman’s 
time inside. Before Mars’s in- 
ternal fires died completely, there 
had been centuries of fierce earth- 
quakes. Split Cliffs must have 
been right over a major fault. 

The place is cataclysmic; it 
looks as though some artist from 
the Crazy Years — Dali or Archi- 
penko — had designed it in a rage. 
Sharp upcroppings of naked, me- 
tallic rock; deep gashes with per- 



fectly straight hundred - foot 
sides. And because there happens 
to be a certain amount of poison- 
ously foul water underground, 
the place is as heavily vegetated 
as anything on Mars. Some of 
the twisted trees reach as high as 
thirty feet above the ground — by 
Martian standards, huge! 

TT'VEN Demaree, at the wheel 
of the sandcar, kept glancing 
over his shoulder at the Split 
Cliffs until we were well past 
them. 

“I can’t help it,” he said half- 
apologetically to me, catching 
my eyes on him. “Those lousy 
trees could hide anything.” 

“Sure,” I said shortly. “Watch 
what you’re doing.” I wasn’t in 
a mood for conversation — not 
only because of the circum- 
stances, but because my nose was 
getting sore. Even in the car we 
wore respirators — on Keever’s 
orders. I think he had an idea 
that a Martian attack might 
blow out our pressure before we 
could put them on. And three 
hours that morning, plus five 
hours each of the several days 
before, had left my nose pretty 
tender where the respirator plugs 
fit in. 

Dr. Solveig said worriedly, “I 
agree with Williams, please. You 
have come very close to the other 
cars many times. If we should 
hit — ” 



56 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“We won’t hit,” said Demaree. 
But he did concentrate on his 
driving; he maintained his forty 
meters behind the second car, 
following their lead as they 
sought the path of least ups-and- 
downs through the sand dunes 
toward Kelcy. 

It began to look, I thought as 
I watched the reddish sand 
streaming by, as though Keever's 
calculated risk was paying off. 
Certainly we had come nearly 
twenty miles without trouble, 
and past the worst danger spot 
on the trip, the Split Cliffs. If 
our luck held for ten minutes 
more . 

It didn’t. 

“God almighty!” yelled Dema- 
ree, jolting me out of my 
thoughts. I looked where he was 
looking, just in time to see flame 
coursing flat along the ground. 
It snaked in a quivering course 
right at the middle sandcar of 
our three; and when the snaking 
light and the jolting car inter- 
sected . 

Catastrophe. Even in the thin 
air, the sound was like an atomic 
bomb. The spurt of flame leaped 
a mile into the air. 

W E WERE out of the car in 
seconds, and the men from 
Keever’s car joined us. But there 
was nothing to do for the seven 
men in the second car. 

“They went after the biggest,” 



Keever said bitterly. “Now — ” 
He shrugged. One thing was sure, 
and he didn’t have to say it. 
None of us wanted to be in a 
sandcar with the motor going 
right there and then. 

There was no sign of the en- 
emy. Around us were empty sand 
dunes — but not empty, because 
out of them had come the mis- 
sile. The only break was the 
fringe of the Split Cliffs behind 
us. 

Keever methodically zipped 
up his sand cape and went 
through the routine of tucking 
in flaps at the neck and arms 
without speaking. None of us had 
anything to say. Demaree, with 
a stronger stomach than mine, 
took another look inside the 
blackened frame of the second 
sandcar, and came back looking 
as though his stomach wasn’t so 
strong after all. 

We moved away from the 
parked sandcars and the wreck 
of the one that would never move 
again, and held a council of war. 
By Keever’s watch, we had time 
to get to Kelcy or go back to 
Niobe — at a half trot in either 
case. We were exactly at mid- 
point. No one suggested using 
the sandcars again, though there 
wasn’t a flicker of a threat from 
the dunes. 

The decision was Kelcy. 

But the Martians took the de- 
cision out of our hands. 



THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE

We trotted along for nearly an aired planet, so the heat is gone 
hour, on the move twenty min- minutes after sundown, 
utes, resting five, and it began to 

look as if we’d make it to Kelcy T SUPPOSE all of us were 
without any more trouble. thinking those thoughts, 

Though, in truth, we had had though we hadn’t the breath to 
trouble enough, because it would speak them, when the Martians 
be enough of a job getting our- struck again, this time with 
selves back to Niobe without the something new. There was a 
strong probability of trying to golden glow from a sand dune 
carry injured survivors from ahead of us to the left. Keever, 
Kelcy. in the lead, hesitated for a sec- 

The remorseless noonday dead- ond; but he didn’t hesitate long 
line would apply the next day; enough. He plunged on, and 
and travel on Mars by night was when he and two of the others 
nearly out of the question. It is were between the two dunes, 
a thin-aired planet, so the sun golden lightning flashed. It was 
beats down fiercely; it is a thin- like the spray of a fiery hose, 




from one dune top to the other; 
and where it passed, three men 
lay dead. 

It wasn’t fire; there wasn’t a 
mark on the bodies, but they 
where at dusk, when the twilight 
of us, blasted the tops of the 
glowing dunes with our flame 
rifles, but it was a little late for 
that. Demaree and I broke for 
the dune to the right, rifles at the 
ready. We scrambled up the 
sides and spread out halfway up 
to circle it — it was slagged from 
our own rifles at the top, and 
certainly nothing could be alive 
up there. But nothing was alive 
behind it, either — nothing we 



could see. The sands were empty. 

Demaree swore lividly all the 
way back to where the bodies of 
the three men lay. Dr. Solveig, 
bending over them, said sharply, 
“That is enough, Demaree! 
Think what we must do!” 

“But those filthy — ” 
“Demaree!” Solveig stood up 
straight and beckoned to the 
only other survivor who had 
raced to explore the dune to the 
left, with the same results. He 
was a man named Garcia. He 
and I had come out together, but 
I didn’t know him very well. 
“Have you seen anything?” Sol- 
veig demanded. 



Garcia said bitterly, “More of 
that fire, Doc! From that hill I 
could see two or three others 
shining, down along the way to 
Kelcy.” 

“I had suspected that,” Sol- 
veig said somberly. “The Mar- 
tians were aware of what we 
proposed. Kelcy is booby-trap- 
ped; we cannot expect to get 
there.” 

“So where does that leave us?” 
demanded Demaree. “We can’t 
stay here! We can’t even make it 
back to Niobe — we’d get caught 
in the sandstorm. Maybe you’d 
like that, Doc, but I saw a man 
after the sandstorm got him a 
year ago!” A patrolman like our- 
selves, who incautiously found 
himself out in the middle of no- 
where at dusk, when the twilight 
sandstorm rages from East to 
West and no human can live for 
an hour, until the gale passes and 
the tiny, lethal sand grains sub- 
side to the surface of the planet- 
wide desert again. His own res- 
pirators had killed him; the tiny 
whirlpumps were clogged solid 
with sand grains packed against 
the filters, and he had died of 
suffocation. 

Solveig said, “We go back. Be- 
lieve me, it is the only way.” 

“Back where? It’s twenty-five 
miles.” 

“To Niobe, yes. But we shall 
not go that far. I have two pro- 
posals. One, the sandcars; at 



least inside them we will not 
suffocate. Two, the Split Cliffs.” 
We all looked at him as though 
he had gone insane. But in the 
end he talked us around — all but 
Garcia, who clung obstinately 
to the cars. 

W E GOT back to the Split 
Cliffs, leaving Garcia hud- 
dled inside the first car with 
something of the feelings of the 
worshippers leaving Andromeda 
chained to the rock. Not that we 
were much better off, but at 
least there were three of us. 

Solveig had pointed out per- 
suasively that inside the growth 
of the Split Cliffs the sandstorm 
couldn’t touch us ; that there were 
caves and tunnels where the 
three of us, huddled together, 
might keep each other alive till 
morning. He admitted the prob- 
ability that we would find Mar- 
tians there before us was high, 
but we knew the Martians had 
spotted the cars. And at least 
inside the junglelike Split 
Cliffs, they would be at some 
disadvantage. Unless they could 
overpower us by numbers, we 
should be able to fight them off 
if they discovered us. And even 
if they did outnumber us, we 
might be able to kill a few where- 
as on the sand dunes, as we had 
discovered, they would strike and 
be gone. 

Dr. Solveig, in the lead, hesi-

tated and then slipped into the 
dense yellowish vegetation. De- 
maree looked at me, and we fol- 
lowed. 

There were no trails inside, 
nothing but a mad tangle of 
twisty, feather-leaved vines. I 
heard dry vine -pods rattling 
ahead as Solveig spearheaded our 
group, and in a moment we saw 
him again. 

The ground was covered with 
the fine red sand that overlies all 
of Mars, but it was only an inch 
or two deep. Beneath was raw 
rock, split fissured with hairline 
cracks into which the water-seek- 
ing tendrils of the vegetation dis- 
appeared. 

Demaree said softly, “Dr. Sol- 
veig. Up ahead there, by the little 
yellow bush. Doesn’t that look 
like a path?” 

It wasn’t much, just a few 
branches bent back and a couple 
broken off; a certain amount of 
extra bare rock showing where 
feet might have scuffed the sur- 
face sand off. 

“Perhaps so,” said Solveig. 
“Let us look.” 

We bent under the long, 
sweeping branches of a smoke 
tree — too cool now to give off its 
misty yellow gases. We found 
ourselves looking down an almost 
straight lane, too straight to be 
natural. 

“It is a path,” said Dr. Solveig. 
“Ah, so. Let us investigate it.” 



I started to follow him, but 
Demaree’s hand was on my 
shoulder, his other hand pointing 
off to one side. I looked and saw 
nothing but the tangle of growth. 

Solveig turned inquiringly. 
Demaree frowned. “I thought I 
heard something.” 

“Oh,” said Solveig, and un- 
limbered his flame rifle. All three 
of us stood frozen for a moment, 
listening and watching. But if 
there had been anything, it was 
quiet and invisible now. 

D EMAREE said, “Let me go 
first, Doc. I’m a little young- 
er than you.” And faster on the 
draw, he meant. Solveig nodded. 

“Of course.” He stepped aside, 
and Demaree moved silently 
along the trail, looking into the 
underbrush from side to side. 
Solveig waited a moment, then 
followed ; and a few yards behind 
I brought up the rear. I could 
just see Demaree’s body flicker- 
ing between the gnarled tree 
trunks and vines up ahead. He 
hesitated, then stepped over 
something, a vine or dead tree, 
that lay snaked across the path. 
He half turned — 

Snap! 

The vine whipped up and 
twisted about his leg, clung and 
dragged him ten feet into the air, 
hanging head down, as a long 
straight tree beside the path 
snapped erect. 



THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE 



61 




A deadfall — the oldest snare in 
the book! 

“Jack!” I yelled, forgetting 
about being quiet and half-for- 
getting, too, that I was on Mars. 
I leaped toward him, and blund- 
ered against the trees as my legs 
carried me farther than I 
thought. Solveig and I scrambled 
to him, rifles ready, staring 
around for a sight of whatever it 
was that had set the trap. But 
again — 

Nothing. 

Demaree wasn’t hurt, just 
tangled and helpless. A flood of 
livid curses floated down from 
him as he got his wind back and 
began struggling against the vine 
loop around his legs. 

“Take it easy!” I called. “I’ll 
get you down!” And while Sol- 
veig stood guard, I scrambled up 
the tree and cut him loose. I 
tried to hold the vine, but I slip- 
ped, and he plunged to the 
ground unhurt. 

The three of us stood there for 
a moment waiting for the attack. 
And it didn’t come. 

For a moment, the Martians 
had had us; while Demaree was 
in the tree and Solveig and I rac- 
ing toward him, they could have 
cut us down. And they hadn’t. 
They had set the trap, and pass- 
ed up its fruits. 

We looked at each other won- 
deringly. 

Why? 



W E FOUND a cave just off 
the trail, narrow and high, 
but the best protection in sight 
against the dusk sandstorm and 
the night’s cold. The three of us 
huddled inside. Demaree sug- 
gested making a fire. But al- 
though the wood on the ground 
was dry enough to burn even in 
Mars’s thin air, we decided 
against it. Maybe, later on, if 
we couldn’t stand the cold, we’d 
have no choice. Meanwhile, 
though, there was no sense at- 
tracting attention. 

I asked Solveig, who seemed 
to take command of our party, 
if he thought there was any ob- 
jection to talking, and he shrug- 
ged. “How can one tell? Perhaps 
they hear, perhaps they do not. 
Air is thin and sounds do not 
carry far to our ears. To Martian 
ears? I don’t know.” 

So we talked — not loud and 
not much, because there wasn’t, 
after all, much to say. We were 
preoccupied with the contradic- 
tions and puzzlements the Mar- 
tians presented. 

Fantastic weapons that struck 
from nowhere or shimmered into 
being between sand dunes — and 
a culture little beyond the neo- 
lithic. Even Earth’s best guided 
missiles could have been no more 
accurate and little more deadly, 
considering the nature of the tar- 
get, than the one that obliterated 
car number two. And the golden 



62

glow that killed Keever was out 
of our experience althogether. 

And yet — villages of sticks! 
There had been no trace in any 
Martian dwelling of anything so 
complicated as a flame-rifle, 
much less these others . 

It grew very slightly darker, 
bit by bit; and then it was black. 
Even in our cave we could hear 
the screaming of the twilight 
wind. We were in a little slit in 
the raw rock, halfway down one 
of the crevasses that gave the 
Split Cliffs area its name. 
Craggy, tumbled, bare rocks a 
hundred feet below us, and the 
other wall of the crevasse bare 
jumping distance away. We had 
come to it along an irregular 
sloping ledge, and to reach us at 
all the wind had to pass through 
a series of natural baffles. Even 
so, we saw the scant shrubbery at 
the Cave mouth whipped and 
scourged by the dusk-wind. 

Demaree shivered and at- 
tempted to light a cigarette. On 
the fourth try, he got it burning, 
but it went out almost at once. 
It is possible to smoke in Mars’s 
air, but not easy, because of the 
pressure. The tobacco burns 
poorly and tastes worse. He 
grunted, “Damn the stuff. You 
think we’ll be all right here?” 

“From the wind?” asked Sol- 
veig. “Oh, certainly. You have 
seen how little sand was carried 
in here. It is the cold that fol- 



lows the wind that I am think- 
ing of . 

TN HALF an hour the wind was 
■*- gone, but the cold remained, 
deeper and more intense than 
anything I had ever felt before. 
Our sand capes were a help, al- 
most thermally non-conducting 
in either direction. We carefully 
tucked under all the vents de- 
signed to let perspiration escape, 
we folded them around us metic- 
ulously, we kept close together 
and still the cold was almost 
unbearable. And it would grow 
steadily worse for hours. 

“We’ll have to build a fire,” 
said Solveig reluctantly. “Come 
and gather wood.” The three of 
us went scouring up the ledge 
for what we could find. We had 
to go all the way back to the top 
of the crevasse to find enough to 
bother carrying; we brought it 
back, and while Demarest and I 
worked to set it afire, Solveig 
went back for more. It wasn’t 
easy, trying to make it burn. 

Demaree’s pocket lighter wore 
itself out without success. Then 
he swore and motioned me back, 
leveling his flame rifle at the 
sticks. That worked beautifully. 
Every last stick was ablaze in 
the wash of fire from his gun. 
But the blast scattered them 
for yards, half of them go : ng 
over the side of the ledge. We 
charred our fingers and wore our-

selves out picking up the burn- 
ing brands and hurling them 
back into the little hollow where 
we’d started the fire. We dumped 
the remaining armload on the 
little blaze, and watched it grow. 
It was all radiant heat, and our 
backs were freezing while we 
toasted in front; but it helped — 
helped very much. Then Dema- 
ree had an idea, and he slipped 
a cartridge out of his rifle and 
stripped it. The combustible ma- 
terial inside came in a little 
powder, safe enough to handle 
so long as no spark touched it. 
He tossed the detonator cap in 
the fire, where it exploded with 
a tiny snap and puff of flame, 
and carefully measured out the 
powder from the cartridge in 
little mounds, only a few grams 
in each, wrapping each one in a 
twist of dried vine-leaves. 

“In case it goes out,” he ex- 
plained. “If there’s any life in 
the embers at all, it’ll set one of 
these off, and we won’t have to 
blow up the whole bed of ashes 
to get it started again.” 

“Fine,” I said. “Now we’d bet- 
ter build up a woodpile — ” 

We looked at each other, sud- 
denly brought back to reality. 

Astonishing how the mind can 
put aside what it does not wish 
to consider; amazing how we 
could have forgotten what we 
didn’t want to know. Our wood- 
pile reminded us both: Dr. Sol- 



veig had gone for more, nearly 
three quarters of an hour before. 

And it was only a five-minute 
climb to the top of the crevasse. 

T HE MARTIANS. But, of 
course, we had to prove it for 
ourselves. 

And prove it we did. At the 
expense of our weapons, our safe 
cave and fire, and very nearly 
our lives. We went racing up the 
ledge like twin whirligigs, bounc- 
ing in the light Martian gravity 
and nearly tumbling into the 
chasm at every step. 

I suppose that if we thought at 
all, we were thinking that the 
more commotion we made, the 
more likely we were to scare 
the Martians off before they killed 
Dr. Solveig. We were yelling and 
kicking stones into the gorge with 
a bounce and clatter; and we 
were up to the top of the crevasse 
in a matter of seconds, up at the 
top — and smack into a trap. 
They were waiting for us up 
there, our first face-to-face Mar- 
tians. 

We could see them only as you 
might see ghosts in a sewer; the 
night was black, even the star- 
light half drowned by the 
branches overhead, but they 
seemed to gleam, phosphores- 
cently, like decaying vegetation. 
And decay was a word that fitted 
the picture, for they looked like 
nothing so much as corpses.

They had no hands or arms, but 
their faces seemed vaguely hu- 
man. What passed for ears were 
large and hung like a spaniel’s; 
there were eyes, sunken but 
bright, and there was a mouth. 
They were human in size, human 
in the way they came threaten- 
ingly toward us, carrying what 
must have been weapons. 

Demaree’s flame rifle flooded 
the woods with fire. He must 
have incinerated some of them, 
but the light was too blinding, 
we couldn’t see. I fired close on 
the heels of Demaree’s shot, and 
the two of us charged blindly 
into the dark. 

There was light now from the 
blazes we had started, but the 
fires were Mars-fires, fitful, weak, 
and casting shadows that moved 
and disguised movement. We 
beat about the brush uselessly 
for a moment, then retreated to 
the lip of the crevasse. And that 
was a mistake. 

“What about Solveig?” Dema- 
ree demanded. “Did you see any- 
thing — ” 

But he never got a chance to 
finish the sentence. On a higher 
cliff than ours there were scrab- 
blings of motion, and boulders 
fell around us. We dodged back 
down the ledge, but we couldn’t 
hope to get clear that way. 

Demaree bellowed, “Come on, 
Will!” And he started up the 
ledge again, but the boulder 



shower doubled and redoubled. 

We had no choice so we trot- 
ted, gasping and frozen, back 
down to our cave, and ran in. 
And waited. It was not pleasant 
waiting. If the Martians showed 
up at the cave mouth, we were 
done. Because, you see, in our 
potshotting at the golden glow 
on the dunes and our starting a 
fire in the cave and salvoing the 
woods, we had been careless. 

Our flame rifles were empty. 

W E KEPT warm and worried 
all of that night, and in the 
light from our dwindling fire — 
only a couple of branches at a 
time — we could see a figure 
across the crevasse from us. 

It was doing something com- 
plex with objects we could not 
recognize. Demaree, over my ob- 
jections, insisted we investigate, 
and so we parted with a hoarded 
brand. We threw the tiny piece 
of burning wood out across the 
crevasse; it struck over the fig- 
ure in a shower of sparks and a 
pale blue flame, and in the mo- 
mentary light we saw that it was, 
indeed, a Martian. But we still 
couldn’t see what he was doing. 

The dawn wind came, the 
Martian stayed at his post, and 
then, at once, it was daylight. 

We crept to the lip of the cave 
and looked out, not more than 
a dozen yards from the busy 
watching figure. 



THE MIDDLE Of NOWHERE

The Martian looked up once, 
at us, as a busy cobbler might 
glance up from his last. And just 
as unemotionally, the Martian 
staring whitely across the ravine 
returned to what he was doing. 
He had a curious complex con- 
struction of sticks and bits of 
stone, or so it seemed from our 
distance. He was carefully weav- 
ing bits of shiny matter into it 
in a regular pattern. 

Demaree looked at me, licking 
his lips. “Are you thinking what 
I’m thinking, Will?” he asked. 

I nodded. It was a weapon of 
sortie sort, it couldn’t be anything 
else. Perhaps it was a projector 
for the lightnings that blasted 
the sandcars or the golden glow 
that had struck down at us from 
the sand dunes, perhaps some 
even more deadly Martian de- 
vice. But whatever it was, it was 
at pointblank range; and when 
he was finished with it, we were 
dead. 

Demaree said thinly, “We’ve 
got to get out of here.” 

>THE ONLY question was, did 
we have enough time? We 
scrabbled together our flame 
rifles and packs from the back 
of the cave and, eyes fearfully 
on the busy Martian across the 
chasm, leaped for the cave 
mouth just in time to see what 
seemed a procession coming 
down the other side. It was a 



scrambling, scratching tornado, 
and we couldn’t at first tell if it 
was a horde of Martians or a 
sandcar with the treads flapping. 
But then we got a better look. 

And it was neither. It was Dr. 
Solveig. 

The Martian across the way 
saw him as soon as we, and it 
brought that strange complex of 




66 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




bits and pieces slowly around to 
bear on him. “Hey!” bellowed 
Demaree, and my yell was as 
loud as his. We had to warn Sol- 
veig of what he was running 
into. 

But Solveig knew more than 
we. He came careening down the 
ledge across the crevasse, pausing 
only long enough to glance at us 



and at the Martian, and then 
came on again. 

“Rocks!” bellowed Demaree in 
my ear. “Throw them!” And the 
two of us searched feverishly in 
the debris for rocks to hurl at the 
Martian, to spoil his aim. 

We needn’t have bothered. We 
could find nothing more deadly 
than pebbles, but we didn’t need 
even them. The Martian made a 
careful, last-minute adjustment 
on his gadget, and poked it once, 
squeezed it twice and pressed 
what was obviously its trigger. 

And nothing happened. No 
spark, no flame, no shot. Solveig 
came casually down on the Mar- 
tian, unharmed. 

Demaree was astonished, and 
so was I. But the two of us to- 
gether were hardly as astonished 
as the Martian. He flew at his 
gadget like a tailgunner clearing 
a breech jam over hostile inter- 
ceptors. 

That was as far as he got with 
it, because Solveig had reached 
him and in a methodical, almost 
patronizing, way he kicked the 
Martian’s gadget to pieces and 
called over to us, “Don’t worry, 
boys. They won’t hurt us here. 
Let’s get back up on top.” 

TT WAS a long walk back to 
-*■ Niobe, especially with the 
cumbersome gadgetry Solveig 
had found. A thing the size of a 
large machine gun, structurally

like the bits and pieces the Mar- 
tian had put together, but made 
of metal and crystal instead of 
bits of rubble. 

But we made it, all four of us. 
We had picked up Garcia at the 
stalled cars, swearing lividly in 
relief, but otherwise all right. Sol- 
veig wouldn’t tell us much. He 
was right, of course. The import- 
ant thing was to get back to 
Niobe as soon as we could with 
his gimmick. Because the gim- 
mick was the Martian weapon 
that zeroed in on sandcars, and 
the sooner our mechanics got it 
taken apart, the sooner we would 
know how to defend ourselves 
against it. 

We were breathless on the long 
run home, but we were exultant. 
And we had reason to be, be- 
cause there was no doubt in any 
of our minds that a week after 
we turned the weapon over to the 
researchers we would be able to 
run sandcars safely across the 
Martian plains. 

Actually it wasn’t a week; it 
was less. The aiming mechanism 
was nothing so complex as radio; 
it was a self-aiming thermo- 
couple, homing on high tempera- 
tures. We licked it by shielding 
the engines and trailing smoke- 
pots to draw fire. 

Overconfident? No. Any Earth- 
man, of course, could have work- 
ed out a variation which would 
have made the weapon useful 



again in an hour’s leisurely 
thought. But Earthmen are flex- 
ible. And the Martians were not. 
Because the Martians were not 
Martians. 

That is, they were not the 
Martians. 

“Successors,” Solveig explain- 
ed to all of us, back in Niobe. 
“Heirs, if you like. But not the 
inventors. Compared with who- 
ever built those machines, the 
Martians we’ve been up against 
are nothing but animals or chil- 
dren. Like children, they can 
pull a trigger or strike a match. 
But they can’t design a gun or 
even build one by copying an- 
other.” 

Demaree shook his long, lean 
head. “And the original Mar- 
tians?” 

Solveig said, “That’s a sepa- 
rate question. Perhaps they’re 
hiding out somewhere we haven’t 
reached — underground or at the 
poles. But they’re master build- 
ers, whoever and wherever they 
are.” He made a wry face. 
“There I was,” he said, “hiding 
out in a cleft in the rock when 
the dawn wind came. I thought 
I’d dodged the Martians, but 
they knew I was there. As soon 
as the sun came up, I saw them 
dragging that thing toward me.” 
He jerked a thumb at the wea- 
pon, already being checked over 
by our maintenance crews. “I 
thought that was the end, espe-

dally when they pulled the trig- 
ger” 

"And it didn’t go off,” said 
Demaree. 

"It couldn't go off! I wasn’t a 
machine. So I took it away from 
them — they aren’t any stronger 
than kittens — and I went back to 
look for you two. And there was 
that Martian waiting for you. I 
guess he didn’t have a real gun, 
so he was making one, the way a 
kid’ll make a cowboy pistol out 
of two sticks and a nail. Of 
course, it won’t shoot. Neither 
did the Martians’, as you noted.” 

We all sat back and relaxed. 
"Well,” said Demaree, “that’s 
our task for this week. I guess 
you’ve shown us how to clean up 
what the Earthside papers call 
the Martian Menace, Doc. Pro- 
vided, of course, that we don’t 
run across any of the grownup 
Martians or the real Martians or 
whatever it was that designed 
those things.” 

Solveig grinned. “They’re eith- 
er dead or hiding, Demaree,” he 
said. "I wouldn’t worry about 
them.” 

And unfortunately, he didn’t 
worry about them, and neither 
did any of the rest of us. 

Not for nearly five years.

Konrad Rontgen and the X-ray 
tube. The device itself is as fas- 
cinating as any device can be, 
but it was discovered by a thor- 
oughly “routine” professor, un- 
distinguished in every respect up 
to the time when he made his 
discovery which, incidentally, 
was fairly late in his life. The 
biographers of Professor Rontgen 
have always had a hard time 
finding something to say about 
the man — not something fasci- 
nating (that doesn’t exist), but 
something, anything, that could 
be said about him rather than 
his discovery and its consequen- 
ces. 

The second editorial policy — 
the art editor is not permitted 
to voice a dissenting view — is 
based on the assumption that, 
although much effort and money 
have been spent on colorful and 
painstaking illustrations, the 
reader of the magazine has not 
looked at the pictures before he 
started reading. 

Disbelieving both these prem- 
ises, I am going to write about 
“things” — animals — and any 
mention of people will be purely 
accidental and can be skipped. I 
am also convinced that every 
reader has by now looked at the 
“monsters” and is wondering 
what I have to say about them. 
Well, aren’t you? In your place, 
I would. All right, then, let’s pro- 
ceed. 



T HE time was 1545. The place 
was the city of Frankfurt on 
the Main, more particularly the 
office of Herr Cyriacus Jacobus, 
a printer. There was a manuscript 
on the table, which was in Ger- 
man and not in Latin, as would 
have been more likely for the 
time. However, this deficiency 
was partly made up by the fact 
that it was a translation from the 
Latin. 

The original author had been 
the Doctor universalis Albert von 
Bollstadt, better known as Alber- 
tus Magnus. He had been a con- 
temporary of Roger Bacon; in 
fact, the two managed to respect 
each other without being in the 
least friendly. Unlike Roger Ba- 
con, Albertus Magnus never got 
into any trouble with his ecclesi- 
astical superiors. He also wrote 
far more than Bacon; the first 
printed edition of his works filled 
21 folio volumes. 

One of them had been about 
animals, written around 1250. 
Now, in 1545, a Walther Ryff had 
translated this book into German 
and Cyriacus Jacobus was will- 
ing to print it — but not without 
illustrations. The public would 
prefer an illustrated book and, 
since woodcuts could be printed 
like type, there had to be wood- 
cuts, which meant finding an art- 
ist to draw the pictures. 

The trouble began at that 
point. Albertus had traveled 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



71 




widely; to find an equally trav- 
eled artist was not easy. Besides, 
a description of something is one 
thing and a picture of something 
is a different story. The artist who 
was picked had only a manu- 
script to work from, nothing else. 
If, right now, I called on my 
wife Olga for a drawing of an 
African elephant, say, she’d pick 
a minimum of seven books off 
the shelves, with photographs of 
African elephants in all conceiv- 
able positions fit to print. She’d 
study a painting by Wilhelm 
Kuhnert, who had lived in Africa 
for the purpose of painting Afri- 
can wild life. Moreover, she has 
seen African elephants in assort- 
ed zoological gardens. 

The artist who had to illustrate 
Ryff’s translation of the animal 
book by Albertus Magnus had 
just a manuscript. There was 
mention of a bird the size of a 
chicken, which was called Lage- 
phus. The manuscript stated that 
Pliny the Elder had called this 
bird Lagopus. This means “hare- 
footed” and the real reason had 
been that the legs of this bird 
look as if hare’s fur grew on them. 
To the artist, the idea of a bird 
with a hare’s feet did not make 
much sense. But if the learned 
Pliny had used such a term, there 
had to be a reason; maybe the 
bird had other characteristics of 
a hare. 

The result was our Fig. 1. 




Fig. 1. This it the bird Lagnphus . 



T HEN there was a paragraph 
saying “there is a fish in the 
seas that has eight feet, hence 
it is called octopus, which means 
‘eight feet.’ ” Yes, it does, but you 
cannot imagine an octopus un- 
less you have seen one. So the 
fish with eight feet turned out as 
shown in Fig. 2. 




Fig. 2. ... while this it an "octopui" 



One picture (Fig. 3) might

time if the name had not given 
the misunderstanding away. The 
text reads: “Erinus is a fish in the 
seas that has its head and mouth 
turned down below and carries 
the gateway for the excrements 
on top above; it walks by means 
of its spines, which it uses like 
feet.” You won’t catch on unless 
the word erinus reminds you of 
the zoological term echinoder- 
mata or, more specifically, the 
class of the echinoidea, the sea 
urchins. The description then 
makes sense; the picture is a fine 
example of good will and con- 
fusion. 

At that same time, there lived 
a French scientist named Guil- 
laume Rondelet. By profession, 
he was a physician; by avocation, 
a zoologist who was especially 
interested in the fishes of the 
Mediterranean Sea. In his book, 
Rondelet presented Fig. 4 and 
5, with protestations that he had

not seen these two marvels of 
the sea himself, but was merely 
showing what had come to him 
from the places where the events 
were alleged to have taken place. 
The ‘‘sea monk” was supposed to 
have been washed ashore on the 
Norway coast after a violent 
storm. The “sea bishop” was re- 
ported to have appeared at the 
shore of the Baltic along a then 
Polish portion of the coast in 
1531. 

The artist who drew the picture 
of the “sea monk” should be giv- 
en some benefit of the doubt; he 
may have been sincere. When 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



73 





this picture is reproduced, it is 
usually printed in such a way 
that the “sea monk” stands on 
his feet and the original Latin 
title is erased, since it would seem 
to interfere. 

But when you look at it in 
the position used here, you begin 
to see that this might be a form- 
alized picture of an octopus or of 
a squid. If one man sketched the 
squid as it was lying — dead or 
almost dead — at the seashore and 
another artist then tried to “clean 
up” the sketch, this picture might 
well be the result. 

A S for the “sea bishop,” 1 take 
him to be a Jenny Haniver 
— a “willful and premeditated” 
distortion of a ray. During the 
time mentioned in the story, quite 
a number of people living at the 
seashore amused themselves by 
skillful distortion of rays, which 
were then dried and sold to the 
type of customer that even then 
was born at the rate of one per 
minute, as “dead basilisks,” “dried 
young dragons” or as whatever 
else would bring money. The 
practice of making the things 
that were later called Jenny Han- 
ivers (nobody knows why) must 
have been widespread then, for 
Konrad Gesner of Zurich, in his 
Book of Fishes (1558), pictured 
one for the sole purpose of ex- 
posing “the wandering apothe- 
caries and other peddlers who 



show such shams to the ignorant.” 

But it was Konrad Gesner him- 
self and on the very occasion of 
compiling his Book of Fishes who 
had trouble. He knew that there 
were gigantic “fish” in the seas — 
the whales — and he had to in- 
clude them. There were numerous 
pictures that Gesner did not be- 
lieve by any means, but they were 
source material and they were 
backed by Olaus Magnus of Up- 
sala in Sweden. 

Olaus Magnus had been a 
churchman, an archbishop and 
even the Metropolitan of all 
Sweden. He could not simply be 
called a liar. Besides, Gesner 
realized that he, living in Swit- 
zerland, could not really judge 
things of the seas. So he repeated 
the pictures, letting Olaus Mag- 
nus bear all the responsibility. 

The contemporaries even had 
a special derisive term for them: 
“Olaus* Midnight Marvels.” 

We now know that Olaus did 
recount tall tales, but as regards 
those pictures, there is some repe- 
tition of the case of the pictures 
in Ryff. The artist had been 
confronted with “a fish in the seas 
that is called the marine uni- 
corn.” It was really great re- 
straint not to picture the whole 
marine unicorn, modeled either 
on the traditional heraldic uni- 
corn or the fish that had been 
served for supper the night be- 
fore. He only pictured the head

(Fig. 6), however. What was real- 
ly meant was, of course, the nar- 
whal. He exercised similar 
restraint in the case of the “sea 
cow” (Fig. 7), which, in all prob- 
ability, referred to marine mam- 
mals of the type of the dugong 




Fig. 6. The marine Unicorn 




Fig. 7. The sea cow 



■VBTHEN it came to whales, re- 
** straint would have been un- 
wise. There were lots of tales 
about spouting gigantic mons- 
ters, bigger than the whaling ship 
(not impossible, or not notice- 
ably exaggerated, considering the 
size of ships then in use), which 
were eager to attack, but might 
be successfully diverted by throw- 



ing empty barrels overboard. 

Fig. 8 shows such a scene while 
Fig. 9 illustrates an old story 
that had been around since Rom- 
an times and had made its ap- 
pearance in such widely different 
places as the tales of Sindbad 
the Sailor and Norse folklore; 
namely, of the sleeping sea mon- 
ster mistaken for an island so 
that the ship drops anchor and 
men go ashore to make a fire for 
cooking. 

Fig. 10 shows the flensing of 
a whale (with bagpipe music) 
and is the most realistic of the 
whole batch. That fact is easily 
explained. The flensing of a whale 
washed ashore is the one aspect 
of whaling the artist could actu- 
ally have watched. 

Fig. 11 is strictly a “bonus” 
for those of my readers who like 
riddles. It is from Gesner’s book; 
Gesner said that Olaus Magnus 
pictured it sine nomine — without 
giving it a name. Gesner, there- 
fore, did not know what it was 
or what it was supposed to be. 
Neither do I. Nor have I found 
a guess about it anywhere else. 
But it certainly would ruin all 
theories about naval architecture 
and shipbuilding if it were true. 

S UCH things could happen in 
1450 and even in 1550. But 
then people grew more careful. 
Possibly. 

The unfortunate fact is that

you can be careful and still make 
mistakes, especially if you ven- 
ture into a completely new field. 

There is the case of the bones 
of the Zeunickenberg, a small 
mountain — hill would be a better 
term — near the German city of 
Quedlinburg. Local peasants had 
told of big bones half buried 
there. One day in 1663, an enter- 
prising man by the name of Otto 
von Guericke — now mostly re- 



membered as the inventor of the 
air pump — started digging in that 
area. There were bones and teeth, 
so the peasants had spoken the 
truth. But what had these bones 
been when still alive? 

Otto von Guericke decided that 
it may have been a unicorn. And 
he put the bones together into 
the shape shown in Fig. 12. The 
picture has been preserved only 
because it was published by Leib-

example of Olaus' Midnight Marvels

Although the bones themselves 
have been lost, mislaid or dis- 
carded in the meantime, we can 
tell what they really were. The 
big tooth is very clearly a molar 
of a woolly mammoth and the 
other bones, allowing for some 
breakage, probably were, too. 

It was only natural that the 
pioneers of the new science of 
paleontology, who began groping

their way into the distant past 
during the later part of the 18th 
century, would repeat some of 
the mistakes zoologists had made 
three centuries earlier. 

In 1784, a scientist by the name 
of Collini came across an in- 
teresting fossil that had just been 
found in th£ lithographic slate 
of Eichstatt in Franconia. The 
fossil was in rather good condi- 
tion. 

There was a head with enor- 
mously long jaws, bearing com- 
paratively few and small teeth. 
There were the vertebrae of a 
long, thin neck. There were the 
vertebrae and a few ribs of a 
small body, the well-preserved 
remains of a birdlike leg and foot 
and the less well-preserved re- 
mains of the other. And there 
were the bones of the “forelegs,” 
quite clear and also quite large. 

The problem was how all this 
had functioned when the animal 
was still alive. 

Collini did not commit himself 
too much; he gave a careful de- 
scription of the find and referred 
to it as the “unknown marine ani- 
mal.” The word “marine” crept 
in, I should think, because the 
fossils of the lithographic slate 
are (with a very few but also 
very important exceptions) de- 
cidedly marine in character, like 
crabs, fishes, sea lillies, etc. 

Some twenty years after the 
discovery, a Professor Hermann 



in Strasbourg suggested to the 
great Georges Cuvier in Paris 
that he study this fossil. Cuvier 
did and realized that he was 
looking at what must once have 
been a flying reptile. 

It was the first known to sci- 
ence and Cuvier named it Ptero- 
dactylus. 

C UVIER’S ability to recognize 
something that had no liv- 
ing counterpart was superlative 
— but he could not convince his 
fellow scientists in a hurry. They 
simply did not take to the idea 
of a flying reptile. Birds could fly 
and so could bats, but flying 
reptiles? 

Hence, Prof. Johannes Wagler 
reasoned — as late as 1830 and 
after Cuvier’s third publication 
on the subject — that Collini had 
probably been right with his 
term “marine animal” and he re- 
constructed pterodactylus as 
shown in Fig. 13. Just how “pec- 
toral fins” of such disproportion- 
ate size could operate is some- 
thing he never explained. But he 
would not have liked the mod- 
ern concept (Fig. 14) of how 
pterodactylus looked and be- 
haved. 

Just as there is no true flying 
reptile around any more, there is 
no known living reptile that hab- 
itually walks on its hind legs 
only. The Australian lizard 
Chlamydosaurus does it when in

a hurry and some of the Old first remains came to light, the 
World monitor lizards and of the fact that many dinosaurs had a 
New World iguanas have been bipedal walk was not yet known, 
seen to do the same. But none And iguanodon itself was slow 
walk around on their hind legs to reveal it, for what was first 
in the manner of an ostrich, found of it were just a few teeth. 
In the geologic past, many large Here Cuvier made a mistake; 
reptiles did just that; Iguanodon he thought they had belonged to 
comes to mind quickly as a clas- a rhinoceros. It was Gideon Man- 
sical example. However, when its tell in England who saw that the

teeth from the past resembled 
the teeth of the living iguanas 
and concluded that the original 
owner had been a very large rep- 
tile of plant-eating habits. 

Then a few bones were found, 
a piece of the skull and a strange 
bony spike, like a straight horn. 
(They also found large three- 
toed footprints, but they did not 
know yet that these were made 
by iguanodon.) 

Gideon Mantell was especially 
happy about this horn, which, in- 
cidentally, had been found by his 
wife. The teeth were rather simi- 



lar to those of the living iguanas 
and some of the living iguanas 
carry a small horn on the tip of 
their noses. Here was proof that 
the extinct and mighty iguano- 
don had also possessed a nose 
horn. Mantell even developed an 
idea of “necessary resemblances,” 
which he termed the “law of cor- 
relation.” 

N OW it was time to draw a 
picture. An artist by the 
name of John Martin sketched 
something like a very large and 
overstuffed iguana. Since the 



80 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




hind legs were not yet known, the 
feet turned out to resemble those 
of a bear. The front feet, partly 
known then, ditto. The tail was 
made short and plump, the neck 
likewise. The head was largely 
fantasy, but Mrs. Mantell’s bony 
spike was placed on the nose. 

This was in 1838. 

A few years later, plans for the 
Crystal Palace began to take 
shape and, since “the gigantic 
animals of the past” had just be- 
come fashionable, they had to be 
there, too. The sculptor Water- 
house Hawkins was commis- 
sioned to put “life size” statues 
of some in the garden of the 
Crystal Palace. Even considering 
the knowledge of the time, he did 
a very poor job (Fig. 15). 

A critic of the time wrote, es- 
pecially about the iguanodon, 
that this was an inexplicable 
whim of the scientists who draw 
pictures of animals they cannot 
possibly believe themselves. It 
would be interesting to confront 
this critic with a picture of iguan- 
odon as it actually looked. 
(Fig. 16.) 

Iguanodon was admittedly a 
rather specialized character, as 
could easily be seen when, in 
1878, more than a dozen complete 
and well-preserved skeletons were 
discovered in the Sainte Barbe 
mine near Bernissart in Belgium. 
Walking upright on three-toed 
hind feet, it carried its head high 




and the beak must have looked 
like that of an enormous turtle. 

It was hornless. The alleged 
horn was found to be something 
else entirely that could not pos- 
sibly have been guessed. 

The spike was actually the 
thumb of iguanodon. Its front 
feet greatly resembled human 
hands, but with both thumbs 
converted into enormous immov- 
able daggers. To substitute for 
the immobilized thumb, the 
“little finger” had become op- 
posable. We aren’t sure yet 
whether the other three fingers 
were movable; it seems likely. 

Little remains to be added, but 
I can’t help thinking of some- 
thing Sir Winston Churchill once 
said. Speaking of political mis- 
takes of the past, he declared: 
“These mistakes will not be re- 
peated; we’ll probably make our 
own set of mistakes.” 

I’m afraid this is applicable in 
science, too. — WILLY LEY

Sam had led a peaceful and impecunious life 
—until a voice cut in on a phone and said: 



Sam, this is You 

By MURRAY LEINSTER 

Illustrated by MEL HUNTER 



Y OU are not supposed to 
believe this story, and if 
you ask Sam Yoder about 
it, he is apt to say that it’s all a 
lie. But Sam is a bit sensitive 
about it. He does not want the 
question of privacy to be raised 
again — especially in Rosie’s hear- 
ing. And there are other matters. 
But it’s all perfectly respectable 
and straightforward. 

It could have happened to 
anybody — well, almost anybody. 
Anybody, say, who was a tele- 
phone lineman for the Batesville 
and Rappahannock Telephone 
Company, and who happened to 
be engaged to Rosie, and who 
had been told admiringly by Ro- 
sie that a man as smart as he

was ought to make something 
wonderful of himself. And, of 
course, anybody who’d taken that 
seriously and had been puttering 
around on a device to make pri- 
vate conversations on a party-line 
telephone possible, and almost 
had the trick. 

It began about six o’clock on 
July second, when Sam was up 
a telephone pole near Bridge’s 
Run. He was hunting for the 
place where that party line had 
gone dead. He’d hooked in his 
lineman’s phone and he couldn’t 
raise Central, so he was just go- 
ing to start looking for the break 
when his phone rang back, 
though the line had checked 
dead. 

Startled, he put the receiver to 
his ear. “Hello. Who’s this?” 

“Sam, this is you,” a voice re- 
plied. 

“Huh?” said Sam. “What’s 
that?” 

“This is you,” the voice on the 
wire repeated. “You, Sam Yoder. 
Don’t you recognize your own 
voice? This is you, Sam Yoder, 
calling from the twelfth of July. 
Don’t hang up!” 

S AM hadn’t even thought of 
hanging up. He was annoyed. 
He was up a telephone pole, try- 
ing to do some work, resting in 
his safety belt and with his 
climbing irons safely fixed in the 
wood. Naturally, he thought 



somebody was trying to joke 
with him, and when a man is 
working is no time for jokes. 

“I’m not hanging up,” said 
Sam dourly, “but you’d better!” 
The voice was familiar, though 
he couldn’t quite place it. If it 
talked a little more, he undoubt- 
edly would. He knew it just 
about as well as he knew his own, 
and it was irritating not to be 
able to call this joker by name. 

The voice said, “Sam, it’s the 
second of July where you are, 
and you’re up a pole by Bridge’s 
Run. The line’s dead in two 
places, else I couldn’t talk to you. 
Lucky, ain’t it?” 

“Whoever you are,” Sam said 
formidably, “it ain’t going to be 
lucky for you if you ever need 
telephone service and you've kept 
wasting my time. I’m busy!” 
“But I’m you!” insisted the 
voice persuasively. “And you’re 
me! We’re both the same Sam 
Yoder, only where I am, it’s July 
twelfth. Where you are, it’s July 
second. You’ve heard of time- 
traveling. Well, this is time-talk- 
ing. You’re talking to yourself 
— that’s me — and I’m talking to 
myself — that’s you — and it looks 
like we’ve got a mighty good 
chance to get rich.” 

Then something came into 
Sam’s memory and every muscle 
in his body went taut and tight, 
even as he was saying to himself, 
“It can’t be!” 



84 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




But he’d remembered that if 
a man stands in a comer and 
talks to the wall, his voice will 
sound to him just the way it 
sounds to somebody else. Being 
in the telephone business, he’d 
tried it and now he did recognize 
the voice. It was his. His own. 
Talking to him. Which, of course, 
was impossible. 

“Look,” said hoarsely, “I don’t 
believe this!” 

“Then listen,” the voice said 
briskly. And Sam’s face grew red. 
It burned. His ears began to feel 
scorched. Because the voice — his 
voice — was telling him strictly 
private matters that nobody else 
in the world knew. Nobody but 
himself and Rosie. 

“Quit it!” groaned Sam. 
“Somebody might be listening! 
Tell me what you want and ring 
off!” 

The voice told him what it 
wanted. His own voice. It sounded 
pleased. It told him precisely what 
it wanted him to do. And then, 
very kindly, it told him exactly 
where the two breaks in the line 
were. And then it rang off. 

H E sweated when he looked at 
the first of the two places. 
A joining was bad and he fixed 
that. It was where his voice had 
said it would be. And that was 
as impossible as anything else. 

When he’d fixed the second 
break, Sam called Central and 



told her he was sick and was 
going home, and that if there 
were any other phones that need- 
ed fixing today, people were prob- 
ably better off without phone 
service, anyhow. 

He went home and washed his 
face, and made himself a brew 
of coffee and drank it, and his 
memory turned out to be unim- 
paired. Presently he heard him- 
self muttering. 

So he said defiantly, “There 
ain’t any crazy people in my fam- 
ily, so it ain’t likely I’ve gone 
out of my head. But God knows 
nobody but Rosie knows about 
me telling her sentimental that 
her nose is so cute, I couldn’t 
believe she ever had to blow it! 
Maybe it was me, talking to my- 
self!” 

Talking to oneself is not ab- 
normal. Lots of people do it. Sam 
missed out the conclusion to be 
drawn from the fact that he’d 
answered himself back. 

He reasoned painfully, “If 
somebody drove over to Rappa- 
hannock, past Dunnsville, and 
telephoned back that there was 
a brush fire at Dunnsville, I 
wouldn’t be surprised to get to 
Dunnsville and find a brush fire 
there. So if somebody phones 
back from next Tuesday that Mr. 
Broaddus broke his leg next Tues- 
day — why, I shouldn’t be sur- 
prised to get to next Tuesday and 
find he done it. Going to Rappa- 



SAM, THIS IS YOU 



85 




hannock, past Dunnsville, and 
going to next Thursday, past 
next Tuesday, ain’t so much dif- 
ference. It’s only the difference 
between a road-map and a cal- 
endar.” 

Then he began to see implica- 
tions. He blinked. 

“Yes, sir!” he said in awe. “I 
wouldn’t’ ve thought of it if I 
hadn’t told myself on the tele- 
phone, but there is money to be 
made out of this! I must be near 
as smart as Rosie thinks I am! 
I’d better get that dinkus set up!” 

He’d more or less half-hearted- 
ly worked out an idea of how a 
party-line telephone conversation 
could be made private, and just 
out of instinct, you might say, 
he’d accumulated around his 
house a lot of stuff that should 
have been on the phone com- 
pany’s inventory. There were con- 
densers and transmitters and 
selective-ringing bells and resist- 
ances and the like. He’d meant 
to put some of them together 
some day and see what happened, 
but he’d been too busy courting 
Rosie to get at it. 

TVTOW he did get started. His 
-L ' own voice on the telephone 
had told him to. It had warned 
him that one thing he had in- 
tended wouldn’t work and some- 
thing else would. But it was 
essentially simple, after all. He 
finished it and cut off his line 



from Central and hooked this 
gadget in. He rang. Half a minute 
later, somebody rang back. 

“Hello!” said Sam, quivering. 
He’d broken the line to Central, 
remember. In theory, he shouldn’t 
have gotten anybody anywhere. 
But a very familiar voice said 
“Hello” back at him, and Sam 
swallowed and said, “Hello, Sam. 
This is you in the second of 
July.” 

The voice at the other end said 
cordially that Sam had done 
pretty well and now the two of 
them — Sam in the here and now 
and Sam in the middle of the 
week after next — would proceed 
to get rich together. But the voice 
from July twelfth sounded less 
absorbed in the conversation than 
Sam thought quite right. It seem- 
ed even abstracted. And Sam was 
at once sweating from the pure 
unreasonableness of the situation 
and concious that he rated con- 
gratulation for the highly tech- 
nical device he had built. After 
all, not everybody could build a 
time-talker! 

He said with some irony, “If 
you’re too busy to talk — ” 

“I’ll tell you,” replied the voice 
from the twelfth of July, gratified. 
“I am kind of busy right now. 
You’ll understand when you get 
to where I am. Don’t get mad, 
Sam. Tell you what — you go see 
Rosie and tell her about this and 
have a nice evening. Ha-ha!” 



86 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Now what,” asked Sam cag- 
ily, “do you mean by that ‘ha- 
ha’?” 

“You’ll find out,” said the 
voice. “Knowin’ what I know, I’ll 
even double it. Ha-ha, ha-ha!” 

There was a click. Sam rang 
back, but got no answer. He may 
have been the first man in history 
to take an objective and com- 
pletely justified dislike to himself. 

But presently he grumbled, 
“Smart, huh? Two can play at 
that! I’m the one that’s got to 
do things if we are both goin’ 
to get rich.” 

He put his gadget carefully 
away and combed his hair and 
ate some cold food around the 
house and drove over to see Rosie. 
It was a night and an errand 
which ordinarily would have 
seemed purely romantic. There 
were fireflies floating about, and 
the Moon shone down splendidly, 
and a perfumed breeze carried 
mosquitoes from one place to 
another. It was the sort of night 
on which, ordinarily, Sam would 
have thought only of Rosie, and 
Rosie would have optimistic ideas 
about how housekeeping could, 
after all, be done on what Sam 
made a week. 

They got settled down in the 
hammock on Rosie’s front porch, 
and Sam said expansively, 
“Rosie, I’ve made up my mind 
to get rich. You ought to have 
everything your little heart de- 



sires. Suppose you tell me what 
you want so I’ll know how rich 
I’ve got to get.” 

T>OSIE drew back. She looked 
sharply at Sam. “Do you feel 
all right?” 

He beamed at her. He’d never 
been married and he didn’t know 
how crazy it sounded to Rosie 
to be queried on how much money 
would satisfy her. There simply 
isn’t any answer to the question. 

“Listen,” said Sam tenderly. 
“Nobody knows it, but tonight 
Joe Hunt and the Widow Backus 
are eloping to North Carolina to 
get married. We’ll find out about 
it tomorrow. And day after to- 
morrow, on the Fourth of July, 
Dunnsville is going to win the 
baseball game with Bradensburg, 
seven to five, all tied till the ninth 
inning, and then George Peeby 
is going to hit a homer with Fred 
Holmes on second base.” 

Rosie stared at him. Sam ex- 
plained complacently. The Sam 
Yoder in the middle of the week 
after next had told him what to 
expect in those particular cases. 
He would tell him other things 
to expect. So Sam was going to 
get rich. 

Rosie said, “Sam! Somebody 
was playing a joke on you!” 

“Yeah?” Sam answered com- 
fortably. “Who else but me knows 
what you said to me that time 
you thought I was mad at you 



SAM, THIS IS YOU 



87 




and you were crying out back 
of the well-house?” 

“Sam!” 

“And nobody else knows about 
that time we were picnicking and 
a bug got down the back of your 
dress and you thought it was a 
hornet.” 

“Sam Yoder!” wailed Rosie. 
“You never told anybody about 
that!” 

“Nope,” said Sam truthfully. 
“I never did. But the me in the 
week after next knew. He told 
me. So he had to be me talking 
to me. Couldn’t’ve been anybody 
else.” 

Rosie gasped. Sam explained 
all over again. In detail. When 
he had finished, Rosie seemed 
dazed. 

Then she said desperately, 
“Sam! Either you’ve t-told some- 
body else everything we ever said 
or did together, or else — there’s 
somebody who knows every word 
we ever said to each other! That’s 
awful! Do you really and truly 
mean to tell me — ” 

“Sure I mean to tell you,” said 
Sam happily. “The me in the 
week after next called me up and 
talked about things nobody 
knows but you and me. Can’t be 
no doubt at all.” 

Rosie shivered. “He — he knows 
every word we ever said! Then 
he knows every word we’re say- 
ing now!” She gulped. “Sam Yod- 
er, you go home!” 



Sam gaped at her. She got up 
and backed away from him. 

“D-do you think,” she chat- 
tered despairingly, “that I — that 
I’m g- going to talk to you when 
s- somebody else — listens to every 
w-word I say and — knows every- 
thing I do? D-do you think I’m 
going to m-marry you?” 

Then she ran away, weeping 
noisily, and slammed the door on 
Sam. Her father came out pres- 
ently, looking patient, and asked 
Sam to go home so Rosie could 
finish crying and he could read 
his newspaper in peace. 

i^\N the way back to his own 
” house, Sam meditated dark- 
ly. By the time he got there, he 
was furious. The him in the week 
after next could have warned him 
about this! 

He rang and rang and rang, 
on the cut-off line with his gadget 
hooked in to call July the twelfth. 
But there was no answer. 

When morning came, he rang 
again, -but the phone was still 
dead. He loaded his tool-kit in 
the truck and went off to work, 
feeling about as low as a man 
could feel. 

He felt lower when he reported 
at the office and somebody told 
him excitedly that Joe Hunt and 
the Widow Backus had eloped 
to North Carolina to get married. 
Nobody would have tried to 
stop them if they had prosaically 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




gotten married at home, but they 
had eloped to make it more ro- 
mantic. 

It wasn’t romantic to Sam. It 
was devastating proof that there 
was another him ten days off, 
knowing everything he knew and 
more besides, and very likely 
laughing his head off at the fix 
Sam was in. Because, obviously, 
Rosie would be still more con- 
vinced when she heard this news. 
She’d know Sam wasn’t crazy 
or the victim of a practical joke. 
He had told the truth. 

It wasn’t the first time a man 
got in trouble with a woman by 
telling her the truth, but it was 
new to Sam and it hurt. 

He went over to Bradensburg 
that day to repair some broken 
lines, and around noon, he went 
into a store to get something to 
eat. There were some local sports- 
men in the store, bragging to each 
other about what the Bradens- 
burg baseball team would do to 
the Dunnsville nine. 

Sam said peevishly, “Huh! 
Dunnsville will win that game 
by two runs!” 

“Have you got any money that 
agrees with you?” a local sports- 
man demanded pugnaciously. 
“If you have, put it up and let 
somebody cover it!” 

Sam wanted to draw back, but 
he had roused the civic pride of 
Bradensburg. He tried to tempo- 
rize and he was jeered at. In the 



end, philosophically, he dragged 
out all the money he had with 
him and bet it — eleven dollars. 
It was covered instantly, amid 
raucous laughter. And on the way 
back to Batesvilfe, he reflected 
unhappily that he was going to 
make eleven dollars out of know- 
ing what was going to happen 
in the ninth inning of that ball 
game, but probably at the cost 
of losing Rosie. 

TTE tried to call his other self 
that night again. There was 
no more answer than before. He 
unhooked the gadget and re- 
stored normal service to himself. 
He rang Rosie’s house. She an- 
swered the phone. 

“Rosie,” Sam asked yearning- 
ly, “are you still mad at me?” 

“I never was mad at you,” said 
Rose, gulping. “I’m mad at who- 
ever was talking to you on the 
phone and knows all our private 
secrets. And I’m mad at you if 
you told him.” 

“But I didn’t have to tell him! 
He’s me! All he has to do is just 
remember! I tried to call him 
last night and again this morn- 
ing,” he added bitterly, “and he 
don’t answer. Maybe he’s gone 
off somewheres. I’m thinking it 
might be a — a kind of illusion, 
maybe.” 

“You told me there’d be an 
elopement last night,” retorted 
Rosie, her voice wobbling, “and

there was. Joe Hunt and the Wid- 
ow Backus. Just like you said!” 
“It — it could’ve been a coinci- 
dece,” suggested Sam, not too 
hopefully. 

“I’m — w-waiting to see if 
Dunnsville beats Bradensburg 
seven to five tomorrow, tied to the 
ninth, with George Peeby hitting 
a homer then with Fred Holmes 
on second base. If — if that hap- 
pens, I’ll — I’ll die!” 

“Why?” asked Sam. 

“Because it’ll mean that I 
can’t m-marry you ever, because 
somebody else’d be looking over 
your shoulder — and we wouldn’t 
ever be by ourselves all our lives 
— night or day!” 

She hung up, weeping, and Sam 
swore slowly and steadily and 
with venom while he worked to 
hook up his device again — which 
did not make a private conver- 
sation on a party line, but allow- 
ed a man to talk to himself ten 
days away from where he was. 
And then Sam rang, and rang, 
and rang. But he got no answer. 

The following day, in the big 
fourth of July game, Dunnsville 
beat Bradensburg seven to five. 
It was tied to the ninth. Then 
George Peeby hit a homer, with 
Fred Holmes on second base. 
Sam collected his winnings, but 
grimly, without joy. 

He stayed home that night, 
worrying, and every so often try- 
ing to call himself up on the de- 



vice he had invented and been 
told — by himself— to modify. It 
was a nice gadget, but Sam did 
not enjoy it. It was a nice night, 
too. There was moonlight. But 
Sam did not enjoy that, either. 

Moonlight wouldn’t do Sam 
any good so long as there was 
another him in the middle of the 
week after next, refusing to talk 
to him so he could get out of the 
fix he was in. 

l^EXT morning, though, the 
-L ^ phone woke him. He swore 
at it out of habit until he got out 
of bed, and then he realized that 
his gadget was hooked in and 
Central was cut off. He made it 
in one jump to the instrument. 
“Hello!” 

“Don’t fret,” said his own voice 
patronizingly. “Rosie’s going to 
make up with you.” 

“How in blazes d’you know 
what she’s going to do?” raged 
Sam. “She won’t marry me with 
you hanging around! I’ve been 
trying to figure out a way to get 
rid of you — ” 

“Quiet!” commanded the voice 
on the telephone irritably. “I’m 
busy. I’ve got to go collect the 
money you’ve made for us.” 

“you collect money? I get in 
trouble and you collect money?” 
“I have to,” his voice said with 
the impatient patience of one 
speaking to a small idiot child, 
“before you can have it. Listen

here. Where you are, it’s Wed- 
nesday. You’re going over to 
Dunnsville today to fix some 
phones. You’ll be in Mr. Broad- 
dus’ law office about half-past 
ten. You look out the window and 
notice a fella setting in a car in 
front of the bank. Notice him 
good!” 

“I won’t do it,” said Sam de- 
fiantly. “I ain’t taking any orders 
from you! Maybe you’re me, but 
I make money and you collect 
it. For all I know you spend it 
before I get to it! I’m quitting 
this business right now. It’s cost 
me my own true love and all my 
life’s happiness and to hell with 
you!” 

“You won’t do it?” his own 
voice asked nastily. “Wait and 
see!” 

So, that morning, the manager 
told Sam, when he reported for 
work, to drive over to Dunnsville 
and check on some lines there. 
Sam balked. He said there were 
much more important lines need- 
ing repair elsewhere. The manager 
explained politely to Sam that 
Mr. Broaddus over in Dunnsville 
had been taken drunk at a Fourth 
of July party and fallen out of a 
window. He’d broken his leg, so it 
was a Christian duty to make sure 
he had a telephone in working 
order in his office, and Sam could 
get over there right away or else. 

On the way to Dunnsville, Sam 
morosely remembered that he’d 



known about Mr. Broaddus’ leg. 
He had told himself about it on 
the telephone. 

At half-past ten, he was fixing 
Mr. Broaddus’ telephone when he 
remembered about the man he 
was supposed to get a good look 
at, sitting in a car in front of the 
bank. He made an angry resolu- 
tion not, under any circum- 
stances, to glance outside of the 
lawyer’s office. He meditated sav- 
agely that, by this resolution, the 
schemes of his other self in the 
future were abolished. 

Naturally, he presently went 
to the window and looked to see 
what he was abolishing. 

r I \HERE was a car before the 
bank with a reddish-haired 
man sitting in it. A haze came out 
of the ‘exhaust, showing that the 
motor was running. None of this 
impressed Sam as remarkable. 
But as he looked, two other men 
came running out of the bank. 
One of them carried a bag and 
both of them had revolvers out 
and they piled into the car and 
the reddish-haired man gunned 
it and it was abruptly a dwin- 
dling speck in a cloud of dust, 
getting out of town. 

Three seconds later, old Mr. 
Bluford, president of the bank, 
came out yelling, and the cashier 
came after him, and it was a first- 
rate bank robbery they were 
yelling about. The men in the get- 



SAM, THIS IS YOU 



91 




away car had departed with 
thirty-five thousand dollars. 

All of it had taken place so 
fast that Sam hardly realized 
what had happened when he went 
out to see what it was all about, 
and was instantly seized upon to 
do some work. The bankrobbers 
had shot out the telephone cable 
out of town with a shotgun, so 
word couldn’t get ahead of them. 
Sam was needed to re-establish 
communications with the outside 
world. 

He did, absorbedly reflecting 



on the details of the robbery as 
he’d heard them. He was high up 
on a telephone pole and the sher- 
iff and enthusiastic citizens were 
streaking past in cars to make his 
labors unnecessary, when the per- 
sonal aspect of all this affair hit 
him. 

“Migawd!” gasped Sam, shock- 
ed. “That me in the middle of 
next week told me to come over 
here and watch a bank robbery! 
But he didn’t let on what was go- 
ing to happen so’s I could stop 
it!” He felt an incredulous in- 




92 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




dignation come over him. “I 
woulda been a hero!” he said re- 
sentfully. “Rosie woulda admired 
me! That other me is a born 
crook!" 

Then he realized the facts. The 
other him was himself, only a 
week and a half distant. The 
other him was so far sunk in 
dastardliness that he permitted 
a crime to take place, feeling no 
more than sardonic amusement. 

And there was nothing he him- 
self could do about it! He could- 
n’t even tell the authorities about 
this depraved character! They 
wouldn’t believe him unless he 
could get his other self on the 
telephone to admit his criminal- 
ity. Even then, what could they 
do? 

Sam felt what little zest had 
been left in living go trickling 
out of his climbers. He looked 
into the future and saw nothing 
desirable in it. 

He painstakingly finished the 
repair of the shot-out telephone 
line, but then he went down to 
his truck and drove over to 
Rosie’s house. 

There was but one thing he 
could do. 

R OSIE came suspiciously to the 
the door. 

“I come to tell you good-by, 
Rosie,” said Sam. “I just found 
out I’m a criminal, so I aim to go 
and commit my crimes far away 



SAM, THIS IS YOU 



93 



from my home and the friends 
who never thought I’d turn out 
this way. Good-by, Rosie.” 
“Sam!” said Rosie. “What's 
happened now?” 

He told her about the bank 
robbery and how his own self — 
in the week after next — had 
known it was going to happen, 
and told Sam to go watch it with- 
out giving him information by 
which it could have been stopped. 

“He knew it after it happen- 
ed,” said Sam bitterly, “and he 
could’ve told me about it before! 
He didn’t, so he’s a accessory to 
the crime. And he is me, which 
makes me a accessory, too. Good- 
by, Rosie, my own true love! 
You’ll never see me again!” 

“You set right down here,” 
Rosie ordered firmly. “You have- 
n’t done a thing yet, so it’s that 
other you who’s a criminal. You 
haven’t got a thing to run away 
for!” 

“But I’m going to have! I’m 
doomed to be a criminal! It’s 
that me in the week after next! 
There’s nothing to be done!” 
“Says who? I'm going to do 
something!” 

“Like what?” asked Sam. 

“I’m going to reform you,” said 
Rosie, “before you start!” 

QHE was a determined girl, 
^ that Rosie. She marched inside 
and put on her blue jeans, then 
went to her father’s woodshed 



where he kept his tools and got 
a monkey wrench and stuck it 
in her hip pocket. 

When she came to the truck, 
Sam said, “What’s the idea, 
Rosie?” 

“I’m riding around with you,” 
replied Rosie, with a grim air. 
“You won’t do anything criminal 
with me on hand! And if that 
other you starts talking to you on 
the telephone, I’m going to climb 
that pole and tell him where he 
gets off!” 

“If anybody could keep me 
from turning criminal,” acknowl- 
edged Sam, “it’d be you, Rosie. 
But that monkey wrench — what’s 
it for?” 

Rosie climbed into the seat be- 
side him. 

“You start having . criminal 
ideas,” she told him, “and you’ll 
find out! Now you go on about 
your business and I and the 
monkey wrench will look after 
your morals!” 

This tender exchange happened 
only an hour or so after the rob- 
bery and there was plenty of ex- 
citement around. But Sam went 
soberly about his work as tele- 
phone lineman. Rosie simply rode 
with him as a — well, it wasn’t 
as a bodyguard, but a sort of 
M.P. escort — Morals Police. 
Where he worked on a line, he 
called the central office to report, 
and he heard about the hunt for 
the bank robbers, and told Rosie.

I T was good fortune that he’d 
been in Dunnsville when the 
robbery happened, because his 
prompt repair of the phone wires 
had spoiled the robbers’ getaway 
plans. They hadn’t gone ten miles 
from Dunnsville before somebody 
fired a load of buckshot at them 
as their car roared by Lemons’ 
Store. They were past before 
they realized they’d been shot at. 
But the buckshot had punctured 
the radiator, and two miles on, 
they were stuck. 

They pushed their car off the 
road behind some bushes and 
struck out on foot, and the sher- 
iff ran right past their car with- 
out seeing it. Then rain began to 
fall and the bank robbers were 
wet and scared and desperate. 
They knew there’d be roadblocks 
set up everywhere and they had 
that bag of money — part bills, 
but a lot of it silver — and all of 
Tidewater was up in arms. 

Taking evasive action, they 
hastily stuffed their pockets with 
small bills — there were no big 
ones — but dared not take too 
much lest the pockets bulge. They 
hid the major part of their loot 
in a hollow tree. They separated, 
going to nearby towns — while rain 
fell heavily and covered their 
trails — and went to bed with chest 
colds. They felt miserable. But 
the rain washed away the scent 
they had left and bloodhounds 
couldn’t do a thing. 



None of this was known to 
Sam, of course. Rosie had taken 
charge of him and she kept charge. 
She rode with him all the after- 
noon of the robbery. When quit- 
ting time came, he took her home 
and prepared to retire from the 
scene. 

But she said grimly, “Oh, no, 
you don’t! You’re staying right 
here! You’re going to sleep in my 
brother’s room, and my pa is 
going to put a padlock on the 
door so you don’t go roaming 
off to call up that no-account 
other you and get in more trou- 
ble!” 

“I might mess things up if I 
don’t talk to him,” Sam objected. 

“He’s messed things up enough 
by talking to you! The idea of 
repeating our private affairs! He 
hadn’t ought to know them! And 
I’m not sure,” she said ominous- 
ly, “that you didn’t tell him! If 
you did, Sam Yoder — ” 

Sam didn’t argue that point, 
for there was no argument to 
make. He was practically meek 
until he discovered after supper 
that the schedule for the evening 
was a game of cribbage played 
in the living room where Rosie’s 
mother and father were. 

He .mentioned unhappily to 
Rosie that they were acting like 
old married people without the 
fun of getting that way, but he said 
that only once. Rosie glared at 
him. And when bedtime came, 



SAM, THIS IS YOU 



95 




she shooed him into her brother’s 
room and her father padlocked 
him in. 

He did not sleep well. 

N EXT morning, there was 
Rosie in her blue jeans with 
a monkey wrench in her pocket, 
ready to go riding with him. She 
did. And the next day. And the 
next. Nothing happened. The 
state banking association put up 
five thousand dollars reward for 
the bank robbers and the insur- 
ance company put up some more, 
but there wasn’t a trace of the 
criminals. 

There wasn’t a trace of crim- 
inality about Sam, either. Rosie 
rode with him, but they exchang- 
ed not one single hand-squeeze, 
nor one melting glance, nor did 
they even play footsie while they 
were eating lunch in the truck 
outside a filling station. Their 
conduct was exemplary and it 
wore on Sam. Possibly it wore 
on Rosie, too. 

One day Sam said morosely, 
as he chewed on a ham sandwich 
at lunch, “Rosie, I’m crazy about 
you, but this feels like I been 
divorced without ever even get- 
ting married first.” 

And Rosie snapped, “If I told 
you how I feel, that other you in 
the week after next would laugh 
his fool head off. So shut up!” 
Things were bad, and they got 
no better. For nearly a week, 



Rosie rode everywhere with Sam 
in his truck. They acted in a 
manner which Rosie’s parents 
would in theory have approved, 
but didn’t even begin to believe 
in. They did nothing the world 
could not have watched without 
their being embarrassed, and they 
said very little that all the world 
would not have been bored to 
hear. 

It must have been the eleventh 
of July when they almost snap- 
ped at each other and Rosie 
said bitterly, “Let me drive a 
while. I need to put my mind on 
something that it don’t make me 
mad to think about!” 

“Go ahead,” Sam invited 
gloomily. He stopped the truck 
and got out the door. “I don’t 
look for any happiness in this 
world any more, anyway.” 

He went around to the other 
side of the truck while she slid to 
the driver’s seat. 

“Tomorrow’s going to be the 
twelfth,” she said. “Do you real- 
ize that?” 

“I hadn’t given it much 
thought,” admitted Sam, “but 
what’s the difference?” 

“That’s the day where the 
other you was when he called you 
up the first time.” 

“That’s right,” said Sam mor- 
bidly. “It is.” 

“And so far,” added Rosie, 
jamming her foot viciously down 
on the accelerator, “I've kept

you honest. If you change into 
a scoundrel between now and 
tomorrow — ” 

She changed to second gear. 
The truck jerked and bounced. 

“Hey!” cried Sam. “Watch 
your driving!” 

“Don’t you tell me how to 
drive!” 

“But if I get killed before to- 
morrow — ” 

R OSIE changed gear again, but 
too soon. The truck bucked, 
and she jammed down the accel- 
erator again, and it almost leaped 
off the road. 

“If you get killed before to- 
morrow,” raged Rosie, “it’ll serve 
you right! I’ve been thinking and 
thinking and thinking. And even 
if I stop you from being a crook, 
there’ll always be that — other you 
— knowing everything we say and 
do.” She was hitting forty miles 
an hear and speeding up. “So 
there’d still be no use. No hope, 
anyway.” 

She sobbed, partly in fury and 
partly in grief. And the roadway 
curved sharply just about there 
and she swung the truck crazily 
around it — and there was a car 
standing only halfway off the 
road. 

Sam grabbed for the steering 
wheel, but there wasn’t time. The 
light half-truck, still accelerating, 
hit the parked car with the noise 
of dozens of empty oil-drums 



falling downstairs. The truck 
slued around, bounced back, and 
then it charged forward and slam- 
med into the parked car a second 
time. Then it stalled. 

Somebody yelled at Sam. He 
got out of the truck, looking at 
the damage and trying to figure 
out how it was that neither he 
nor Rosie had been killed, and 
trying worriedly to think how 
he was going to explain to the 
telephone company that he’d let 
Rosie drive. 

The voice yelled louder. Right 
at the edge of the woodland, there 
was a reddish-haired character 
screaming at him and tugging at 
his hip pocket. The words he 
used were not fit for Rosie’s 
shell-like ears — even if they prob- 
ably came near matching the 
way she felt. The reddish-haired 
man said more nasty words at 
the top of his voice. His hand 
came out of his hip pocket with 
something glittering in it. 

Sam was swinging when the 
glitter began and he connected 
before the gun fired. There was 
a sort of squashy, smacking sound 
and the reddish-haired man lay 
down quietly in the road. 

“Migawd!” said Sam blankly. 
“This was the fella in front of 
the bank! He’s one of those rob- 
bers!” 

He stared. There was a loud 
crashing in the brushwood. The 
accident had happened at the

must watch their language in the 
presence of a lady. The three 
were so dazed, though, by what 
had befallen them that the warn- 
ing wasn’t really necessary. 

Rosie’s parents would have 
been pleased at how completely 
proper their behavior was, while 
they took the three bank robbers 
into town and turned them over 
to the sheriff. 

That night, Rosie sat out on 
the porch with Sam and they dis- 
cussed the particular event of the 
day in some detail. But Rosie 
was still concerned about the 
other Sam. So Sam decided to 
assert himself. 

About half-past nine, he said 
firmly, “Well, Rosie, I guess I’d 
better be getting along home. I’ve 
got to try one more time to call 
myself up on the telephone and 
tell me to mind my own business.’’ 

“Says who?’’ demanded Rosie. 
“You’re staying locked up right 
here tonight and I’m riding with 
you tomorrow. If I kept you hon- 
est this far, I can keep it up till 
sundown tomorrow! Then maybe 
it’ll stick!” 

Sam protested, but Rosie was 
adamant — not only about keep- 
ing him from being a crook, but 
from having any fun to justify 
his virtue. 

CHE shooed him into her broth- 
^ er’s room and her father 
locked him in. And Sam did not 



sleep very well, because it looked 
as though virtue wasn’t even its 
own reward. 

He sat up, brooding. It must 
have been close to dawn when 
the obvious hit him. Then he 
gazed blankly at the wall and 
said, “Migawd! O’course!” 

He grinned, all by himself, 
practically from head to foot. 
And at breakfast, he hummed 
contentedly as he stuffed himself 
with pancakes and syrup, and 
R o s i e ’s depressed expression 
changed to a baffled alarm. 

He smiled tenderly upon her 
when she came doggedly out to 
the truck, wearing her blue jeans 
and with the monkey wrench in 
her pocket. They started off the 
same as any other day and he 
told her amiably, “Rosie, the 
sheriff says we get five thousand 
dollars reward from the bankers’ 
association, and there’s more 
from the insurance company, and 
there’s odd bits of change offered 
for those fellas for past perform- 
ances. We’re going to be right 
well off.” 

Rosie looked at him gloomily. 
There was still the matter of the 
other Sam in the middle of the 
week after next. And just then, 
Sam, who had been watching the 
telephone lines beside the road as 
he drove, pulled off the road and 
put on his climbing irons. 

“What’s this?” asked Rosie 
frightenedly. “You know — ” 



100 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“You listen,” said Sam, com- 
pletely serene. 

He climbed zestfully to the top 
of the pole. He hooked in .the lit- 
tle gadget that didn’t make pri- 
vate conversations possible on a 
party line, but did make it pos- 
sible for a man to talk to him- 
self ten days in the future. 

Or the past. 

“Hello!” said Sam, up at the 
top of the telephone pole. “Sam, 
this is you.” 

A voice he knew perfectly well 
sounded in the receiver. 

“Huh? Who’s that ?” 

“This is you,” said Sam. “You, 
Sam Yoder. Don’t you recognize 
your own voice? This is you, Sam 
Yoder, calling from the twelfth 
of July. Don’t hang up!” 

He heard Rosie gasp, all the 
way down there in the banged-up 
telephone truck. Sam had seen 
the self-evident, at last, and now, 
in the twelfth of July, he was 
talking to himself on the tele- 
phone. Only instead of talking to 
himself in the week after next, he 
was talking to himself in the 
week before last — he being, back 
there ten days before, working 
on this very same telephone line 
on this very same pole. And it 
was the same conversation, word 
for word. 

W HEN he came down the 
pole, rather expansively, 
Rosie grabbed him and wept. 



“Oh, Sam!” she sobbed. “It 
was you all the time!” 

“Yeah,” said Sam complacent- 
ly. “I figured it out last night. 
That me back there in the second 
of July, he’s cussing me out. And 
he’s going to tell you about it and 
you’re going to get all wrought 
up. But I can make that dumb 
me back yonder do what has to 
be done. And you and me, Rosie, 
have got a lot of money coming 
to us. I’m going to carry on 
through so he’ll earn it for us. 
But I’m warning you, Rosie, he’ll 
be back at my house waiting for 
me to talk to him tonight, and 
I’ve got to be home to tell him to 
go over to your house. I’m goin’ 
to say ‘ha-ha, ha-ha’ at him.” 
“A-all right,” said Rosie, wide- 
eyed. “You can.” 

“But I remember that when I 
call me up tonight, back there 
ten days ago, I’m going to be 
right busy here and now. I’m go- 
ing to make me mad, because I 
don’t want to waste time talking 
to myself back yonder. Remem- 
ber? Now what,” asked Sam 
mildly, “would I be doing tonight 
that would make me not want to 
waste time talking to myself ten 
days ago? You got any ideas, 
Rosie?” 

“Sam Yoder! I wouldn’t! I 
never heard of such a thing!” 
Sam looked at her and shook 
his head regretfully. “Too bad. If 
you won’t, I guess I’ve got to call 



SAM, THIS IS YOU

me up in the week after next and 
find out what’s cooking.” 

“You — you shan’t !” said Rosie 
fiercely. “I’ll get even with you! 
But you shan’t talk to that — ” 
Then she wailed. “Darn you, 
Sam! Even if I do have to marry 
you so you’ll be wanting to talk 
to me instead of that dumb you 
ten days back, you’re not going 
to — you’re not-—” 

Sam grinned. He kissed her. 
He put her in the truck and they 
rode off to Batesville to get mar- 
ried. And they did. 



But you’re not supposed to be- 
lieve all this, and if you ask Sam 
Yoder about it, he’s apt to say 
it’s all a lie. He doesn’t want to 
talk about private party lines, 
either. And there are other mat- 
ters. For instance, Sam’s getting 
to be a pretty prominent citizen 
these days. He makes a lot of 
money, one way and another. 
Nobody around home will ever 
bet with him on who’s going to 
win at sports and elections, any- 
how.

GRETA 

January 18, Earth Time 

WISH Max would treat me 
like a woman. 

An hour ago, at dinner, 
John Armitage proposed a toast, 
especially for my benefit. He 
loves to play the gallant. Big man, 
silver mane, very blue eyes, a 
porcelain smile. The head of 
WSC, the perfect example of the 
politician-scientist. 



“To the colony,’' he announc- 
ed, raising his glass. “May Epsi- 
lon love them and keep them. 
May it only be transmittal trou- 
ble.” 

“Amen,” Max said. 

We drank. Taylor Bishop put 
down his glass precisely. Bishop 
is a gray little man with a dif- 
fident voice that belies his repu- 
tation as the best biochemist in 
the system. “Has Farragut hinted 
otherwise?” he asked mildly. 



COMPETITION 



103 




Armitage frowned. “It would 
be scarcely prudent for Senator 
Farragut to alarm the populace 
with disaster rumors.” 

Bishop looked at him out of 
his pale eyes. “Besides, it’s an 
election year.” 

The silence was suddenly ugly. 

Then Armitage chuckled. “All 
right,” he said. “So the Senator 
wants to be a national hero. The 
fact still remains that Epsilon 
had better be habitable or Pan- 
Asia will scream we’re hogging 
it. They want war anyway. With- 
in a month — boom.” 

F OR a moment, I was afraid 
he was going to make a speech 
about Earth’s suffocating bil- 
lions, the screaming tension of 
the cold war, and the sacred ne- 
cessity of Our Mission. If he had, 
I’d have gotten the weeping 
shrieks. Some responsibilities are 
too great to think about. But in- 
stead he winked at me. For the 
first time, I began to realize why 
Armitage was the Director of the 
Scientists World Council. 

“Hypothesis, Greta,” he said. 
“Epsilon is probably a paradise. 
Why should the test colony let 
the rest of the world in on it? 
They’re being selfish.” 

I giggled. We relaxed. 

After supper Armitage played 
chess with Bishop while I fol- 
lowed Max into the control room. 
“Soon?” I said. 



“Planetfall in eighteen hours, 
Doctor.” He said it stiffly, busy- 
ing himself at the controls. Max 
is a small dark man with angry 
eyes and the saddest mouth I’ve 
ever seen. He is also a fine pilot 
and magnificent bacteriologist. I 
wanted to slap him. I hate these 
professional British types that 
think a female biochemist is some 
sort of freak. 

“Honestly,” I said. “What do 
you think?” 

“Disease,” he said bitterly. 
“For the first six months they 
reported on schedule, remember? 
A fine clean planet, no dominant 
life-forms, perfect for immigra- 
tion; unique, one world in a bil- 
lion. Abruptly they stopped send- 
ing. You figure it.” 

I thought about it. 

“I read your thematic on Ve- 
nusian viruses,” he* said abruptly. 
“Good show. You should be an 
asset to us, Doctor.” 

“Thanks!” I snapped. I was 
so furious that I inadvertently 
looked into the cabin viewplate. 

Bishop had warned me. It takes 
years of deep-space time to en- 
able a person to stare at the 
naked Universe without scream- 
ing. 

It got me. The crystal thunder 
of the stars, that horrible hungry 
blackness. I remember I was sort 
of crying and fighting, then Max 
had me by the shoulders, holding 
me gently. He was murmuring 



104 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




and stroking my hair. After a 
time, I stopped whimpering. 
“Thanks,” I whispered. 
“You’d better get some sleep, 
Greta,” he said. 

I turned in. 

I think I’m falling in love. 
January 19 

T ODAY we made planetfall. 

It took Max a few hours to 
home in on the test colony ship. 
He finally found it, on the shore 
of an inland sea that gleamed like 
wrinkled blue satin. For a time 
we cruised in widening spirals, 
trying to detect some signs of 
life. There was nothing. 

We finally landed. Max and 
Armitage donned spacesuits and 
went toward the colony ship. 
They came back in a few hours, 
very pale. 

“They’re dead.” Armitage’s 
voice cracked as he came out of 
the airlock, “All of them.” 
“Skeletons,” Max said. 

“How?” Bishop said. 
Armitage’s hands were shaking 
as he poured a drink. “Looks like 
civil war.” 

“But there were a hundred of 
them,” I whispered. “They were 
dedicated — ” 

“I wonder,” Bishop said 
thoughtfully. “White and brown 
and yellow. Russian and British 
and French and German and 
Chinese and Spanish. They were 
chosen for technical background 



rather than emotional stability.” 
“Rot!” Armitage said like 
drums beating. “It’s some alien 
bug, some toxin. We’ve got to 
isolate it, find an antibody.” 

He went to work. 

January 22 
’M scared. 

It’s taken three days to final- 
ize the atmospheric tests. Oxy- 
gen, nitrogen, helium, with trace 
gases. Those trace gases are 
stinkers. Bishop discovered a new 
inert gas, heavier than Xenon. 
He’s excited. I’m currently check- 
ing stuff that looks like residual 
organic, and am not too happy 
about it. Still, this atmosphere 
seems pure. 

Armitage is chafing. 

“It’s in the flora,” he insisted 
today. “Something, perhaps, that 
they ate.” He stood with a strain- 
ed tautness, staring feverishly at 
the chronometer. “Senator Far- 
ragut’s due to make contact soon. 
What’ll I tell him?” 

“That we're working on it,” 
Bishop said dryly. “That the 
four best scientists in the Galaxy 
are working toward the solution.” 
“That’s good,” Armitage said 
seriously. “But they’ll worry. 
You are making progress?” 

I wanted to wrap a pestle 
around his neck. 

We were all in the control 
room an hour later. Armitage 
practically stood at attention 



106 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




while Farragut’s voice boomed 
from the transmitter. 

It was very emetic. The Sena- 
tor said the entire hemisphere 
was waiting for us to announce 
the planet was safe for immigra- 
tion. He said the stars were a 
challenge to Man. He spoke fear- 
fully of the Coming World Crisis. 
Epsilon was Man’s last chance 
for survival. Armitage assured 
him our progress was satisfac- 
tory, that within a few days we 
would have something tangible 
to report. The Senator said we 
were heroes. 

Finally it was over. Max yawn- 
ed. “Wonder how many voters 
start field work at once.” 

Armitage frowned. “It's not 
funny, Cizon. Not funny at all. 
Inasmuch as we’ve checked out 
the atmosphere, I suggest we 
start field work at once.” 

Taylor blinked. “We’re still 
testing a few residual—” 

“I happen to be nominal lead- 
er of this party.” Armitage stood 
very tall, very determined. “Ob- 
viously the atmosphere is pure. 
Let’s make some progress!” 

February 2 

HIS is progress? 

For the past ten days, we’ve 
worked the clock around. Quan- 
titative analysis, soil, water, 
flora, fauna, cellular, microscopic. 
Nothing. Max has discovered a 
few lethal alkaloids in some 



greenish tree fungus, but I doubt 
if the colony were indiscriminate 
fungus eaters. Bishop has found 
a few new uni cell types, but 
nothing dangerous. There’s one 
tentacled thing that reminds me 
of a frightened rotifer. Max 
named it Armitagium. Armitage 
is pleased. 

Perhaps the fate of the hun- 
dred colonists will remain one of 
those forever unsolved mysteries, 
like the fate of the Mary Celeste 
or the starship Prometheus. 

This planet’s clean. 

February 4 

T ODAY Max and I went speci- 
men-hunting. 

It must be autumn on Epsilon. 
Everywhere the trees are a riot 
of scarlet and ocher, the scrubby 
bushes are shedding their leaves. 
Once we came upon a field of 
thistlelike plants with spiny seed- 
pods that opened as we watched, 
the purple spores drifting afield 
in an eddy of tinted mist. Max 
said it reminded him of Scot- 
land. He kissed me. 

On the way back to the ship 
we saw two skeletons. Each -had 
its fingers tightly locked about 
the other’s throat. 

February 20 

W E have, to date, analyzed 
nine hundred types of plant 
life for toxin content. Bishop has 
tested innumerable sports and

bacteria. Our slide file is im- 
mense and still growing. Max has 
captured several insects. There 
is one tiny yellow bush -spider 
with a killing bite, but the species 
seem to be rare. Bishop has iso- 
lated a mold bacterium that 
could cause a high fever, but its 
propagation rate is far too low 
to enable it to last long in the 
bloodstream. 

The most dangerous animal 
seems to be a two-foot-tall artha- 
pod. They’re rare and peaceable. 
Bishop vivisected one yesterday 
and found nothing alarming. 

Last night I dreamed about the 
first expedition. I dreamed they 
all committed suicide because 
Epsilon was too good for them. 

This is ridiculous! 

We’re working in a sort of 
quiet madness getting no closer 
to the solution. 

Armitage talked to Senator 
Farragut yesterday and hinted 
darkly that the first ship’s hydro- 
ponics system went haywire and 
that an improper carbohydrate 
imbalance killed the colony. 
Pretty thin. Farragut’s getting 
impatient. Bishop looks haggard. 
Max looks grim. 

February 23 

O UR quantitative tests are 
slowing down. We play a 
rubber of bridge each night be- 
fore retiring. Last night I trump- 
ed Max’s ace and he snarled at 



me. We had a fight. This morn- 
ing I found a bouquet of purple 
spore-thistles at my cabin door. 
Max is sweet. 

This afternoon, by mutual con- 
sent, we all knocked off work and 
played bridge. Bishop noticed the 
thistle bouquet in a vase over the 
chronometer. He objected. 

“They’re harmless,” Max said. 
“Besides, they smell nice.” 

I can hardly wait for tomor- 
row’s rubber. Our work is im- 
portant, but one does need re- 
laxation. 

February 25 

RMITAGE is cheating. 
Yesterday he failed to score 
one of my overtricks. We argued 
bitterly about it. Taylor, of 
course, sided with him. Three 
hands later, Armitage got the bid 
in hearts. “One hundred and fifty 
honors,” he announced. 

“That’s a lie,” I said. 

“It was only a hundred,” he 
grinned. “But thank you, Greta. 
Now I shan’t try the queen fin- 
esse.” 

No wonder they’ve won the 
last three evenings! Max is fu- 
rious with them both. 

February 28 

W E played all day. Max and I 
kept losing. I always knew 
Armitage was a pompous toad, 
but I never realized he was slimy. 
This afternoon it was game all.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




and Armitage overcalled my 
diamond opener with three 
spades. Bishop took him to four 
and I doubled, counting on my 
ace-king of hearts and diamonds. 

I led out my diamond ace and 
Armitage trumped from his 
hand. Bishop laid down his dum- 
my. He had clubs and spades 
solid, with doubleton heart and 
diamonds. 

“None?” Max asked Armitage 
dangerously. 

Armitage tittered. I wanted to 
scratch his eyes out. He drew 
trump immediately and set up 
clubs on board, dumping the 
heart losers from his hand, and 
finally sluffing — two diamonds. 

“Made seven,” he said com- 
placently, “less two for the dia- 
mond renege makes five, one 
overtrick doubled. We were vul- 
nerable, so it’s game and rubber.” 

I gasped. “You reneged delib- 
erately !” 

“Certainly. Doubleton in 
hearts and diamonds in my hand. 
If you get in. I’m down one. As 
it was, I made an overtrick. The 
only penalty for a renege is two 
tricks. The rule book does not 
differentiate between deliberate 
and accidental reneges. Sorry.” 

I stared at his florid throat, at 
his jugular. I could feel my 
mouth twitching. 

On the next hand I was dum- 
my. I excused myself and went 
into the lab. I found a scalpel. I 



came up quietly behind Armitage 
and Bishop saw what I was going 
to do and shouted and I was not 
nearly fast enough. Armitage 
ducked and Bishop tackled me. 

“Thanks, dear,” Max said 
thoughtfully, looking at the cards 
scattered on the floor. “We would 
have been set one trick. Club fin- 
esse fails.” 

“She’s crazy!” Armitage’s 
mouth worked. “The strain’s too 
much for her!” 

I cried. I apologized hysteric- 
ally. After a while, I convinced 
them I was all right. Max gave 
me a sedative. We did not play 
any more bridge. Over supper I 
kept staring at Armitage’s throat. 

After eating, I went for a long 
walk. When I got back to the 
ship, everyone was sleeping. 

March 1 

T>ISHOP found Armitage this 
morning, in his cabin. He 
came out, very pale, staring at 
me. 

“You bitch,” he said. “Ear to 
ear. Now what’ll I do for a part- 
ner?” 

“You can’t prove it,” I said. 

“We’ll have to confine her to 
quarters,” Max said wearily. “I’ll 
tell Farragut.” 

“And let him know the expe- 
dition is failing?” 

Max sighed. “You’re right. 
We’ll tell them Armitage had an 
accident.”

I said seriously, “It was ob- 
viously suicide. His mind snap- 
ped.” 

“Oh, God,” Max said. 

They buried Armitage this 
afternoon. From my cabin, I 
watched them dig the grave. 
Cheaters never prosper. 

March 2 

M AX talked with Senator Far- 
ragut this morning. He said 
Armitage had died a hero’s death. 
Farragut sounds worried. The 
Pan-Asians have withdrawn their 
embassy from Imperial Africa. 
Tension is mounting on the home 
front. Immigration must start 
this week. Max was very reas- 
suring. “Just a few final tests, 
Senator. We want to make sure.” 
We puttered in our laboratories 
all afternoon. Bishop seemed 
bored. After dinner he suggested 
three-handed bridge and Max 
said he knew a better game, a 
friendly game his grandmother 
had taught him — hearts. 

March 5 
TT’S a plot! 

All day long Bishop and Max 
have managed to give me the 
queen of spades. It’s deliberate, 
of course. Three times I’ve tried 
for the moon and Bishop has held 
out one damned little heart at 
the end. Once Max was slightly 
ahead on points and Bishop de- 
manded to see the score. I 



thought for a moment they would 
come to blows, but Bishop apol- 
ogized. 

“It’s just that I hate to lose,” 
he said. 

“Quite,” Max said. 

When we finally turned in, 
Bishop was ahead on points. 

Too far ahead. 

March 6 

T SUPPOSE it’s Bishop’s laugh. 

It has a peculiar horselike 
stridency that makes me want to 
tear out his throat. Twice today 
I’ve broken down and cried when 
he made a jackpot. 

I’m not going to cry any more. 

Supper was the usual, beef- 
yeast and vita-ale. I remember 
setting Bishop’s plate in front of 
him, and the way his pale eyes 
gleamed between mouthfuls. 
“Three thousand points ahead,” 
he gloated. “You’ll never catch 
me now. Never, never!” 

That was when he gripped his 
throat and began writhing on the 
floor. 

Max felt his pulse. He stared at 
me. 

“Very nice,” he said. “Quick. 
Did you use a derivative of that 
green fungus?” 

I said nothing. Max’s nostrils 
were white and pinched. “Must I 
make an autopsy?” 

“Why bother?” I said. “It’s 
obviously heart failure.” 

“Yes, why bother?” he said.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




He looked tired. “Stay in your 
cabin, Greta. I’ll bring your 
meals.” 

“I don’t trust you.” 

His laughter had a touch of 
madness. 

March 10 

M AX unlocked my cabin door 
this morning. He looked 
drawn. “Listen,” he said. “I’ve 
checked my respiration, pulse, 
saliva, temperature. All normal.” 
“So?” 

“Come here,” he said. I fol- 
lowed him into the lab. He indi- 
cated a microscope. His eyes were 
bright. 

“Well?’ 

“A drop of my blood,” he said. 
“Look.” 

I squinted into the microscope. 
I saw purple discs. Oddly, they 
did not attack the red blood cells. 
There was no fission, no mitosis. 
The leucocytes, strangely enough, 
let them alone. 

My hands were shaking as I 
took a sterile slide and pricked 
my finger. I put the slide under 
the microscope. I adjusted the 
lens and stared. 

Purple discs, swimming in my 
bloodstream. Thriving. Minding 
their own business. 

“Me, too,” I said. 

“They’re inert,” Max said 
hoarsely. “They don’t affect me- 
tabolism, cause fever, or inter- 
fere with the body chemistry in 



any way. Do they remind you of 
anything?” 

I thought about it. Then I went 
to the slide file that was marked 
flora — negati ve. 

“Right,” Max said. “The pur- 
ple thistle. Spores! The atmos- 
phere is clogged with them. 
Greta, my sweet, we’re infected.” 

“I feel fine,” I said. 

All day long we ran tests. Ne- 
gative tests. We seem to be dis- 
gustingly healthy. “Symbiosis,” 
Max said finally. “Live and let 
live. Apparently we’re hosts.” 

Only one thing disturbs me. 

Most symbiotes do something 
for their host. Something to en- 
hance the host’s survival poten- 
tial. 

We played chess this evening. 
I won. Max is furious. He’s such 
a poor sport. 

March 11 

M AX talked with Senator Far- 
ragut this morning. He gave 
Epsilon a clean bill of health and 
the Senator thanked God. “The 
first starship will leave tonight,” 
the Senator said. “Right on 
schedule, with ten thousand col- 
onists aboard. You’re world he- 
roes!’’ 

Max and I played chess the 
rest of the day. Max won con- 
sistently. He utilizes a fianchetto 
that is utterly impregnable. If he 
wins tomorrow, I shall have to 
kill him.

TF you don’t already know 
about the comic book to end 
all comic books, this volume will 
serve as a splendid introduction. 
If you do (remember its bloody 
takeoff on “Superman” called 
“Superduperman,” for exam- 
ple?), buy lots of copies to give 
your friends. 

Why? Well, this best of all 
satires on the comics — itself a 
regular monthly comic that has 
a national circulation not far 



from a million copies — deserves 
a narrower audience (i.e., intel-

cago Press, $4.00 

JTK) be thoroughly enchanted 
(for a change) by an “inside 
story” of the atom bomb, read 
this book. It’s a housewife’s nar- 
rative of what it was like to live 
with one of the prime pioneers of 
atomic energy, and a charming 
and revealing job it is. 

Did you know, for example, 
that Fermi and some associates 
actually patented a process for 
slowing neutrons so they could 
penetrate uranium atoms as early 
as 1934? Laura Fermi tells you 
this and much, much else in this 
wifely tribute to a great scientist 
and human being. 

Though published before Fer- 
mi died, it remains a fit memorial 
to him: continuously enthralling 



from its description of rugged 
childhood through his invention 
of “Fermi’s Streetcar” on the in- 
credible giant cyclotron now in 
operation at the University of 
Chicago. An unforgettable book. 

CELESTIAL SPACE, INC., by 
Charles Coombs. Westminster 
Press, $2.75 

T^VEN though not really a sci- 
ence fiction juvenile, this 
item deserves a big boost. Coombs 
imagines his young hero, Eddie 
Winston, obtaining a “legal” 
monopoly on 100 light-years of 
space around Earth, from a 
small-town judge who went along 
for the laughs. What follows 
when the press gets hold of the 
story is uproarious chaos. 

Eddie claims rights to every 
sort of space, from that used to 
make the hollow tubes in maca- 
roni to the air that is so cruelly 
tortured when a jet plane tears 
through it. And the payoff — 
young Eddie has a serious motive 
behind his fantastic idea, after 
all — is in itself a wonderful ex- 
ample of American ingenuity.

Sponsored by the British So-

for the existence of ghosts, clair- 
voyance and similar parapsycho-

dence dates from the Victorian 
era, but even so, one’s skepticism 
is shaken by the authority and 
honesty of the researchers and by 
the apparent reality of some (not 
all) the cases. 

No matter what you may think 
of psychical research in general, 
I’ll guarantee you a fascinating 
bit of reading here — far more 
persuasive than the dismally un-

Here is 1955's first important science 
fiction book— a dazzling literary one- 
man show. Many of the magazines 
these stories appeared in are now 
collector's items that cost as much as 
this whole volume. 

Distinguishing this brilliant collec- 
tion from all others are the vivid notes 
from the author's own working journal, 
giving the thematic origin and back- 
ground of every story. Fascinating for 
readers and immensely valuable for 
writers, they demonstrate the skill and 
bravura that have made H. L. Gold 
an acknowledged master both as 
author and editor of science fiction.

Miss Kitty as soon as she wakes all along is pretty definite now.” 



A WOMAN'S PLACE 



119 



Still drowsing, she wondered, 
without any real interest, what 
they felt they must tell her. But 
the other level of her mind was 
more real. She wondered how she 
looked to these two young men 
while she slept. Did she sleep 
with her mouth open? Did her 
tiara slip while she snored? 

V IVIDLY, as in full dreaming, 
she slipped back into the re- 
membered scene which had given 
birth to the phrase. At some so- 
cial gathering she had been about 
to enter a room. She’d overheard 
her name spoken then, too. 

“Miss Kitty is probably a cute 
enough name when you’re 
young,” the catty woman was 
saying. “But at her age!” 

“Well, I suppose you might 
say she’s kept it for professional 
reasons,” the other woman had 
answered with a false tolerance. 
“A school teacher, wanting to be 
cozy with her kiddies, just a big 
sister.” The tolerance was too 
thin, it broke away. “Kind of 
pathetic, I think. She’s so plain, 
so very typical of an old maid 
school teacher. She’s just the kind 
to keep a name like Miss Kitty.” 
“What gets me,” the first one 
scoffed, “is her pride in having 
such a brilliant mind — if she 
really does have one. All those 
academic degrees. She wears 
them on every occasion, like a 
tiara!” 



She had drawn back from the 
door. But in her instant and 
habitual introspection, she rea- 
lized she was less offended than 
perversely pleased because, ob- 
viously, they were jealous of her 
intellectual accomplishments, her 
ability to meet men on their own 
ground, intellectually as good a 
man as any man. 

The half dream drowsiness was 
sharply washed away by the be- 
lated impact of Sam Eadels ques- 
tion to Lt. Harper. Reality flash- 
ed on, and she was suddenly wide 
awake in the lifeboat heading 
back to Earth. 

“What is it you must tell me?” 
She spoke loudly and crisply to 
the men’s broad backs where 
they sat in front of the instru- 
ment panel. The implication of 
the question, itself, that they had 
been holding something back . 

Lt. Harper turned slowly 
around in his seat and looked at 
her with that detested expression 
of amused tolerance which his 
kind of adult male affected to- 
ward females. He was the dark, 
ruggedly handsome type, the 
kind who took it for granted that 
women should fawn over him. 
The kind who would speak the 
fatuous cliche that a woman’s 
place was in the home, not galli- 
vanting off to teach colonists’ 
children on the fourth planet of 
Procyon. Still, perhaps she was 
unjust, she hardly knew the man.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Oh, you awake, Miss Kitty?” 
he asked easily. His tone, as al- 
ways, was diffident, respectful 
toward her. Odd, she resented 
that respect from him, when she 
would have resented lack of it 
even more. 

“Certainly,” she snapped. 
“What is it you must tell me?” 
“When you’re dressed, fresh- 
ened up a bit,” he answered, not 
evasively, but as if it could wait. 

S HE started to insist, but he 
had already turned back to 
the nose window to study the 
starry sky and the huge misty 
green ball of Earth in front of 
them. Sam Eade, the radioman, 
was intently twisting the dials 
on his set with a puckered frown 
between his blond eyebrows. He 
was an entirely different type, 
tall, blond, but just as fatuously 
masculine, as arrogantly hand- 
some. Probably neither one of 
them had an ounce of brains — 
handsome people so seldom need- 
ed to develop mental ability. 

Sam, too, turned his face far- 
ther away from her. Both backs 
told her plainly that she could 
dress, take care of her needs, with 
as much privacy as the lifeboat 
could allow anybody. 

Not that it would take her 
long. She’d worn coveralls since 
the catastrophe, saving the dress 
she’d had on for landing on 
Earth. They’d had to leave most 



of her luggage behind. The lieu- 
tenant had insisted on taking up 
most of the spare space in the 
lifeboat with that dismantled 
space warper from the wreck of 
their ship. 

She combed her short graying 
hair back of her ears, and used a 
little water sparingly to brush 
her teeth. Perhaps it had been a 
quixotic thing, her giving up a 
secure teaching post on Earth to 
go out to Procyon IV. Except 
that she’d dreamed about a new 
colony where the rising genera- 
tion, under her influence, would 
value intellect — with the girls no 
different from the boys. Perhaps 
it had been even sillier to take a 
cabin on a freighter, the only pas- 
senger with a crew of four men. 
But men did not intimidate her, 
and on a regular passenger ship 
she’d have been bored stiff by 
having to associate with the 
women. 

Two of the men . 

It wasn’t quite clear to her, 
even yet, what had happened. 
They’d used the normal drive to 
get clear of regular solar shipping 
lanes. The warning bell had rung 
that they were about to warp 
into hyperspace, a mechanism 
which canceled out distance and 
made the trip in apparent time no 
more than an overnight jaunt to 
Mars. There was a grinding shud- 
der — then a twisted ship which 
looked as if some giant had taken

a wet rag and torqued it to 
squeeze out the water. Lt. Harper 
and Sam had got her out of her 
cabin, and finally into the life- 
boat which was only partly crip- 
pled. 

The other two men of the 
crew . 

She zipped up the front of her 
coveralls with a crisp gesture, as 
if to snap off the vision. She 
would show no weakness in front 
of these two men. She had no 
weakness to show! 

“All right, gentlemen,” she said 
incisively to their backs. “Now. 
What is it I must be told?” 

L T. HARPER pointed to the 
ball of Earth so close ahead. 
It was huge, almost filling the 
sky in front of them. The misty 
atmosphere blurred outlines 
slightly, but she could make out 
the Eastern halves of North and 
South America clearly. The 
Western portions were still in 
dim darkness. 

“See anything wrong, Miss 
Kitty?” the lieutenant asked 
quietly. 

She looked more closely, sens- 
ing a possible trap in his ques- 
tion, a revealment of her lack of 
knowledge. 

“I’m not an authority on celes- 
tial geography,” she said cau- 
tiously, academically. “But ob- 
viously the maps I’ve seen were 
not accurate in showing the true 



continental proportions.” She 
pointed to a small chart hanging 
on the side wall. “This map 
shows Florida, for example, a 
much longer peninsula than it 
actually is. A number of things 
like that. I don’t see anything 
else wrong, but, of course, it’s 
not my field of knowledge.” 

Lt. Harper looked at her ap- 
provingly, the kind of look she 
gave a bright pupil who’d been 
especially discerning. 

“Only it’s not the map that’s 
wrong, Miss Kitty,” he said. “It 
is my field of knowledge, and 
I’ve seen those continental out- 
lines hundreds of times. They al- 
ways corresponded to the map 
. before.” 

She looked at him without 
comprehension. 

“Not only that,” Sam Eade en- 
tered the conversation. “As soon 
as we were clear of the wreck, 
Lt. Harper took a fix on stars and 
constellations. He’s an astroga- 
tor. He knows his business. And 
they were wrong, too. Just a 
little wrong, here and there, but 
enough. And even more than 
that. On a tight beam, I should 
have been able to make a con- 
nection with Earth headquarters 
on this set. And I haven’t yet got 
communication, and we know 
there’s nothing wrong with this 
set.” 

“Sam knows his business, too, 
Miss Kitty,” Lt. Harper said. “If 



122 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




he can’t get communication, it’s 
because there isn’t any.” 

She looked wide-eyed from 
one to the other. For once, she 
was more concerned with a prob- 
lem than with concealing her ig- 
norance about it. 

“It means,” the lieutenant said, 
as if he were answering a ques- 
tion she hadn’t yet asked, “that 
the Earth we are returning to is 
not the Earth we left.” 

“I don’t understand,” she 
gasped. 

“There’s a theory,” Lt. Harper 
answered slowly. “Heretofore it 
has been considered only a math- 
ematical abstraction, and having 
no counterpart in reality. The 
theory of multiple dimensions.” 
She looked at him closely, and 
in her habitual ambivalence of 
thought reflected that he sounded 
much more intelligent than she 
had suspected. 

“I've read about that,” she 
answered. 

He looked relieved, and threw 
a quick look at Sam. Apparently 
he had underestimated her intel- 
ligence, too — in spite of all her 
degrees. 

E never thought it could be 
real,” he emphasized. “But 
the theory was that multiple uni- 
verses lay side by side, perhaps 
each an instant’s time away from 
the other. The only thing I can 
see is that some flaw in the space 



warper threw us out of our dim- 
ension into another one closely 
adjacent — not far enough for 
things to be totally different, just 
different enough that the dupli- 
cation isn’t identical. It’s Earth, 
but it’s not our Earth. It’s a New 
Earth, one we don’t know any- 
thing about.” 

“In another few hours, we’ll be 
entering the atmosphere,” Sam 
put in, “and we don’t know what 
we’ll find. We thought you ought 
to know.” 

She flared in exasperation at 
the simple assumption of male 
arrogance. 

“Of course I should know!” she 
snapped back. “I am not one of 
your little bits of blonde, empty- 
headed fluff to be protected by 
strong males! I should have been 
told immediately!” 

Lt. Harper looked at Sam with 
a broad grin. It was amusement, 
but it was more — a confirmation 
that they could depend on her to 
take it in her stride — an approv- 
al. Apparently, they had discuss- 
ed more things about her than 
she’d overheard, while she slept. 
He didn’t turn off the grin when 
he looked directly at her. 

“What could you have done 
about it, if we had told you, Miss 
Kitty?” he asked mildly. 

IT was not the same Earth. The 
*■ charts and maps had not been 
wrong. Her tentative theory that 




A WOMAN'S PLACE 



123 




perhaps there were vision flaws 
in the plastic nose window had 
not stood up. 

The continents, the lakes, the 
rivers — the topography really 
was distorted. Now there was the 
Mississippi River, one spot swing- 
ing rather too widely to the East. 
The Great Lakes were one huge 
inland sea. The Gulf of Mexico 
swung high up into what had 
once been Alabama and Georgia. 

There was no New Orleans, 
shipping center of the world, 
headquarters of Space. 

There were no cities anywhere 
up and down the Mississippi. 
Where St. Louis should have 
been, there was virgin forest. As 
they dropped down into the up- 
per reaches of atmosphere, ex- 
periencing the familiar and some- 
times nauseating reference shift 
from ahead to below, there had 
been no New York to the East, no 
San Francisco to the West. There 
had been no Boulder Dam, no 
Tennessee Valley project, no con- 
tinuous hydroelectric installa- 
tions running the entire length of 
the Mississippi, where the 
strength of the Father of the 
Waters had finally been harness- 
ed for Man. There were no thin 
lines of highways, no paint-brush 
strokes of smoke against the can- 
vas of the Gulf of Mexico to 
denote steamers, for atomic power 
was still not available to all. 

On this New Earth, Man could 



not yet have reached a state of 
complex technology. 

And as they dropped lower 
still, through their telescope 
sights, they saw no canoes on the 
river or the feeder streams. They 
saw no huts along the river shore, 
no thin streamers of wood smoke 
from huts hidden under the trees 
along the bayous. New Earth was 
purple and blue, then shading in- 
to green as they dropped lower. 
They sighted a deer drinking at 
the edge of a pool. 

But there was no trace of Man. 

“If there are no scars, no de- 
facements upon this forest pri- 
meval,” Miss Kitty said didac- 
tically, “then Man has not 
evolved on New Earth.” Since it 
was spoken in. the tone of an 
axiom, and there was no evidence 
to refute it, neither of the two 
men felt like arguing the matter. 

T HEY were low enough now 
that they were flying horizon- 
tally rather than dropping ver- 
tically. They were still searching 
for traces of some kind of arti- 
facts. They were also searching, 
Lt. Harper advised them at last, 
for a suitable place to land. They 
wanted a higher ground than the 
delta country so they might be 
free of insect pests, assuming 
there were some since deer could 
be seen throwing their heads back 
along their sides as if to chase 
away flies. They wanted higher

ground with a stream of water 
going over falls to supplement 
their limited power in the life- 
ship. On the chance there were 
fish, it would be nice to be handy 
to a lake. A forest for game. A 
level ground for a permanent 
camp. 

Since they were here, and it 
might be some time before they 
could figure out a way to return 
to Old Earth, they may as well 
make the best of it. 

They found the kind of place 
they wanted, a little to the west 
of the Mississippi. They ground- 
ed the lifeship at the edge of a 
natural clearing beside a lake 
where a stream of sparkling water 
dropped from a rock ledge. 

They settled the ship on the 
springy turf, then sat and looked 
at one another as if they were 
suddenly all strangers. Wordless- 
ly, Lt. Harper got up and opened 
the door of the lifeship. He threw 
down the hinged metal steps. He 
stood back. Miss Kitty went 
through the door first and down 
the steps. The two men followed. 

They stood on the ground of 
New Earth, and looked at one 
another the way they had in the 
ship. In the minds of each there 
was the thought that some kind 
of a ceremonial speech should be 
made, but no one volunteered it. 

“I suppose we should have a 
campfire,” Miss Kitty said doubt- 
fully. 



They did not realize it at the 
time, but it was the most effec- 
tive speech which could have 
been devised. It was a symbol. 
Man had discovered and taken 
possession of New Earth. His in- 
stinctive thought was to place his 
brand upon it, an artificial fire. 

All of them missed the signi- 
ficance of the fact that it was 
Miss Kitty who had made the 
first move in the domestication of 
this New Earth. 

N the weeks which followed, 
Miss Kitty began to be dimly 
aware of the significance. At first 
they had lived a sort of Robinson 
Crusoe kind of life, leaning pretty 
heavily upon the stores of the 
liferaft. 

It had been she who had con- 
verted it over into more of the 
Swiss Family Robinson pattern 
of making use of the resources 
about them. 

The resources were abundant, 
bountiful. Yet the two men seem- 
ed little interested, and appeared 
content to live off the stores with- 
in the liferaft. They devoted al- 
most all their time, except that 
little for bringing up firewood 
and trapping game, to fiddling 
with that gadget they called a 
warp motor. They were trying to 
hook it up to the radio sets, they 
said. 

Miss Kitty detested women 
who nagged at men, but she felt 



A WOMAN'S PLACE 



125 




compelled to point out that this 
was the fall season upon New 
Earth, and winter would soon be 
upon them. It should not be a 
severe winter at this latitude, but 
they must be prepared for it with 
something more substantial than 
her uncomfortable sleeping place 
in the liferaft; nor would the two 
of them continue to enjoy sleep- 
ing out under the trees, if a blan- 
ket of snow fell some night. 

“I was hoping we could be 
back home before winter sets in, 
Miss Kitty,” Lt. Harper apolo- 
gized mildly. 

She had not nagged them. She 
had simply shut her lips and 
walked away. 

The next day they began cut- 
ting logs. 

It was odd, the basic pleasure 
she felt in seeing the sides of the 
cabin start to take form. Certain- 
ly she was not domestic by na- 
ture. And this could, in no sense, 
be considered a home. Still, she 
felt it might have gone up faster, 
if the men had used their muscles 
— their brute strength — rather 
than spend so much futile time 
trying to devise power tools. 

They were also inclined to talk 
too much about warping radio 
wave bands through cross sec- 
tions of sino waves, and to drop 
their work on the cabin in favor 
of spending long hours trying new 
hookups. 

But Miss Kitty never nagged 



about it. She had even tried to 
follow some of the theory, to 
share in their efforts to put such 
theory into practice, to be just 
a third fellow. Instead she found 
her thoughts wandering to how 
an oven could be constructed so 
she could bake and roast meats 
instead of broiling and frying 
them over an open fire. 

Game was plentiful, fish seem- 
ed to be begging for the hook. 
Every day, without going too far 
away from camp, she found new 
foods ; watercress, mustard 
greens, wild turnips, wild onions, 
occasionally a turkey nest with 
eggs still edible, hollow trees 
where wild bees had stored honey, 
persimmons still astringent, but 
promising incredibly sweet and 
delicious flavor when frost struck 
them, chinquapin, a kind of 
chestnut, black walnuts. There 
was no end to what the country 
provided. Yet the men, instead 
of laying in winter stores, spent 
their time with the warp motor. 

W ITHOUT meaning to. Miss 
Kitty interrupted an ex- 
planation of Lt. Harper’s on how 
they were calibrating the torquing 
degrees. She told him that he and 
Sam simply must help her har- 
vest a hillside patch of wild maise 
she had found, before the rains 
came and ruined all the grain 
with mold, or the migrating birds 
ate it all.

The cabin they were erecting 
would contain only two rooms — 
a large general room for cooking, 
eating, visiting, such as an old- 
fashioned farm kitchen had once 
been. A little room, opening off 
it, would be her sleeping room. 
She raised her eyebrows ques- 
tioningly, and Sam explained 
they would build a small, separ- 
ate bunkhouse for himself and 
Lt. Harper. 

She had a curious sense of dis- 
pleasure at the arrangement. She 
knew she should be pleased at 
their understanding of the need 
for privacy. There was no point in 
becoming primitive savages. She 
should be grateful that they 
shared her determination to pre- 
serve the civilized codes. She told 
herself, rather severely, that the 
preservation of civilized mores 
was extremely important. And 
she brought herself up short with 
a shocking question, equal to a 
slap in the face. 

Why? 

She realized then she had in- 
tuitively known from the first 
that they would never get back 
to Old Earth. Her instincts had 
been functioning, insuring their 
lives, where intellect had failed 
them completely. She tried to 
laugh scornfully at herself, in 
feminist tradition. Imagine! 
Katheryn Kittredge, Career Wo- 
man, devoted to the intellectual 
advancement of Man, thinking 



that mere cooking and cleaning 
and mending was the supremely 
important thing. 

But she failed in her efforts to 
deride herself. The intellectual 
discussions among the small 
groups of intelligent girls back 
on Old Earth were far away and 
meaningless. She discovered she 
was a little proud and strangely 
contented that she could prepare 
edible food. Certainly the two 
men were not talented; and some- 
one had to accept the responsi- 
bility for a halfway decent do- 
mestic standard and comfort. 

As, for example, with the walls 
of the cabin halfway up, it was 
necessary to point out that while 
they may be going to put the 
little cookstove — welded together 
out of metal scrap — in the cabin, 
there was no provision for a fire- 
place. How would they keep 
warm through the long winter 
months this year, and in the 
years to come? 

Lt. Harper had started to say 
something. Then he shrugged 
and a hopeless look came over 
his face. 

“Perhaps you are right, Miss 
Kitty,” he said humbly. “It may 
be spring, at that, before we can 
finish trying the more obvious 
combinations. We’re trying to...” 
He broke off, turned away, and 
began to mark off the spot where 
they would saw down through 
the logs to fit in a fireplace. 



A WOMAN'S PLACE 



127 





L ATER that day, she over- 
heard him tell Sam that, the- 
oretically at least, there could be 
millions of versions of the Earth, 
each removed an infinitesimal 
point from the next. There was 
the chance the flaw in the torque 
motor, which still eluded him, 
might not automatically take 
them back to the right cross-sec- 
tion, even if he found it. They 
might have to make an incredible 
number of trials, and then again 
they might hit it on the very next 
combination. 

“And you might not!” she cut 
into the conversation, with per- 
haps more acid in her voice than 
she intended. “It might not be 
your next, nor tomorrow, nor 
next spring — nor ever!” 

Odd that she had felt an ob- 
scure satisfaction at the stricken 
looks on their faces when she had 
said it. Yet they had it coming 
to them. It was time someone 
shocked them into a sense of 
reality. It took a woman to be a 
realist. She had already faced the 
possibility and was reconciled to 
it. They were still living in an 
impossible dream. 

Still she was sorry. She was 
sorry in the way she had always 
regretted having to make a bad 
boy in kindergarten go stand with 
his face to the wall. She tried to 
make up for it that evening. 

“I understand,” she said as 
they sat near the campfire out- 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



side the half-finished cabin. “You 
alter the torque, then try the va- 
rious radio wave bands in the new 
position.” 

They both looked at her, a 
little surprised. 

“It must be a slow and tedious 
procedure,” she continued. 

“Very,” Sam said with a groan. 

A shifting air current, carrying 
the sound of the waterfall, gave 
her an idea. 

“Too bad you can’t borrow the 
practice of Tibetan monks,” she 
mused. “They tie their prayers 
to a wheel, set it in a running 
stream. Every turn of the wheel 
is a prayer sent up to their gods. 
That way they can get their pray- 
ing done for them while they go 
about the more urgent matters 
of providing a living for them- 
selves and their families.” 

She hadn’t meant it to be so 
pointed, implying that all they 
were doing was sending up futile 
prayers to unheeding gods, im- 
plying they should be giving 
more attention to setting in win- 
ter stores. But even so . 

“Miss Kitty,” Sam said in a 
kind of awe. “You are a wonder- 
ful woman!” 

In spite of her sudden flush of 
pleasure, she was irritated. As 
pointed as she had made it, he 
had missed it. 

He turned and began talking 
excitedly to Lt. Harper. Yes, of 
course, they could rig up an auto- 



matic method instead of doing 
it by hand. It could be done fast- 
er and more smoothly with elec- 
tric motors, but the idea was the 
same. If Lt. Harper could rig a 
trip to kick the warp over another 
notch each time, they could run 
it night and day. Just let some 
kind of alarm bell start ringing, 
if they hit anything at the other 
end! 

The two of them jumped to 
their feet then, grabbed her 
arms, squeezed them, and rushed 
away to the little shed they’d 
constructed beside the lifeship to 
hold some of their scattered 
equipment. 

She felt vaguely regretful that 
she had mentioned it. 

S TILL she gained a great deal. 

The men finished the cabin in 
a hurry after that, and they put 
up their own bunkhouse in less 
than a week. Both jobs were ob- 
viously not done by experts, and 
she had fussed at them, although 
not unkindly, because she had 
had to chink such wide cracks 
with a mixture of clay and dried 
grass. 

She moved into the larger cab- 
in, discovered a dozen roof leaks 
during the first hard rain they’d 
had; got them patched, began 
molding clay into dishes and con- 
tainers, started pressuring the 
boys to build her a ceramics kiln, 
began to think about how their 



clothes would eventually wear 
out and how she would have to 
find some way to weave cloth to 
replace them. Day by day she 
was less irritable, as the boys set- 
tled into a routine. 

“I do believe,” she said to her- 
self one day, “I would be disap- 
pointed if they found a way 
back!” She straightened up and 
almost spilled the container of 
wild rice she had been garnering 
from the swampy spot at the up- 
per reaches of the lake. ‘‘Why! 
The very idea of saying such a 
thing, Katheryn Kittredge!” But 
her heart was not in the self 
chiding. 

But what reason, in heaven’s 
name, would they have for staying 
here? Three people, marooned, 
growing old, dying one by one. 
There was no chance for Man’s 
survival here. From the evidence 
about them, they had come to the 
conclusion that on this New 
Earth, in the tree of evolution, 
the bud to grow into a limb of 
primates had never formed. 

She turned and looked at the 
tall, straight pines ahead of her. 
She saw the deciduous hard- 
woods, now gold and red, to one 
side of her. Behind her the lake 
was teeming with fish. The spicy 
smell of fall was all around her, 
and a stray breeze brought a 
scent of grapes she had overlook- 
ed when she was gathering all 
she could find to make a wine to 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




pleasantly surprise the boys. 

She thought of the flock of wild 
chickens which had learned to 
hang around the cabin for scraps 
of food, the grunting lazy pigs, 
grown quite tame, begging her to 
find their acorns for them, the 
nanny goat with two half- grown 
kids Lt. Harper had brought 
back from a solitary walk he had 
taken. 

New Earth was truly a para- 
dise — and all to be wasted if there 
were not Man to appreciate it 
truly. 

A thought knocked at her 
mind, but she resolutely shut it 
out, refused it even silent ver- 
balization. 

Yet, while she stooped over 
again and busied her hands with 
stripping the rice from the stalks 
without cutting them on the 
sharp dry leaves, she found her- 
self thinking about Mendelian 
law. Line breeding from father 
to daughter, or brother to sister 
— in domestic animals, of course 
— was all right in fixing desirable 
traits, providing certain reces- 
sives in both the dam and the 
sire did not thus become dom- 
inant. 

“There, Katheryn Kittredge,” 
she mumbled with satisfaction. 
“Assuming the responsibilities of 
domesticity has not made you 
forget what you learned.” 

But the danger of fixing re- 
cessives into dominants through 



inbreeding was even less with 
half-brothers and sisters. Now 
daughters by one— er — sire could 
be bred to another sire to get 
only a quarter relationship to a 
similar cross from the other 
father — er — sire. She must work 
it out with a stylus in smooth 
clay. The boys had preempted 
every scrap of paper for their 
pointless calculations. But she 
could remember it, and it would 
be valuable in breeding up a de- 
sirable barnyard stock. 

Yet it was odd that she as- 
sumed two males and only one 
female! 

rWlHEN and there, standing 
ankle deep in the bog of wild 
rice, muddy to her knees in her 
tom coveralls, slapping at per- 
sistent mosquitoes, she came to 
terms with herself. In the back 
of her mind she had known it all 
the time. All this was without 
meaning unless there was Man 
— and a continuity of Man. Even 
so little as this gathering of wild 
rice, before the migrating ducks 
got it, was without meaning, if it 
were merely to stave off death 
from a purposeless existence. If 
there were no other fate for them 
than eventually to die, without 
posterity, then they might as well 
die tomorrow, today, now. 

The men were still living in a 
dream of getting back. No doubt 
their lusting appetites were driv-

ing them to get back to their 
brazen, heavy-breasted, languor- 
ous-eyed hussies who pandered 
to all comers without shame! 
Miss Kitty was astonished at her 
sudden vehemence, the red wave 
of fury which swept over her. 

But of course she was right. 
That was their urgent drive. “A 
male human is nothing more than 
a sex machine!” Wasn’t that what 
her roommate at college had once 
said? Or was it her maiden aunt 
who had dominated her widowed 
mother and herself through all the 
years she was growing up? What 
did it matter who said it? She 
knew it was true. No wonder they 
were so anxious to get back to 
Old Earth! Her lip lifted in cyn- 
ical scorn. 

“You don’t dare leave a young 
girl alone with a boy for five min- 
utes,” her aunt had once com- 
plained bitterly. “All they ever 
think about is . her voice 
had dropped to a whisper and she 
had given that significant look to 
Katheryn’s mother. But Kath- 
eryn had known what she meant, 
of course. 

And it was true of all men. 

Women, back on Old Earth, 
had looked at her with pity and 
a little contempt, because she had 
never, she had never . But you 
didn’t have to have first hand ex- 
perience to know. She had au- 
thoritative knowledge gleaned 
from reading between the lines of 



the very best text books on ab- 
normal psychology. She hadn’t 
had to read between the lines of 
sundry surveys and reports. And 
if there had been no organized 
study at all, the movies, the TV, 
the published better fiction — all 
of it centered around that one 
theme — that one, alone, roman- 
ticize it or obscure it though they 
might. 

It was all men ever thought 
about. And many women pan- 
dered to it — those sultry, shame- 
less, undulating . 

But Sam and Lt. Harper? It 
had been almost two months now 
since they had left Earth and 
those vile blondes. How had they 
restrained themselves during all 
this time! 

Her fuming anger was sudden- 
ly overwhelmed by a warm rush 
of gratitude, a sympathy which 
brought a gush of tears into her 
eyes to stream down her cheeks. 
How blind she had been. Of 
course! They were still bound by 
their gentleman’s Word of Hon- 
or, given to her on that first night 
in the lifeship. 

What splendid men! All right, 
so they had their faults; a little 
impractical, dreamers all, but 
with such nobility of character, 
truly they were fit to be the 
fathers of a proud and noble race. 
And, in time, with herself to 
shape and guide them . 

She straightened her aching 



132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




back from bending over the rice 
reeds, thrust out her scrawny 
chest, and breathed deeply. She 
lifted her chin resolutely. 

“Katheryn Kittredge,” she said 
firmly. “A woman’s place is more 
than merely cooking and clean- 
ing and mending!” 

S UPPER, that evening, was a 
dinner, a special dinner. She 
set before the two men a whole 
roast young tom turkey, with a 
touch of frosted persimmons 
mixed with wild honey to enliven 
the light meat. There was a dress- 
ing of boiled maise and wild rice, 
seasoned with wild onion and 
thyme. There were little red to- 
matoes, tough but tasty. There 
were baked yams. There was a 
custard of goat milk and turkey 
eggs sweetened with honey. 

Instead of the usual sassafras 
tea to which their digestion had 
finally adjusted, there was grape 
wine in their cups. It wasn’t a 
very good wine, still green and 
sharp, but the occasion called for 
it. 

Both of them looked at her 
with wonder, when they came in 
at her call and saw the table. But 
they didn’t ask any questions. 
They just started eating and, for 
once, they forgot to talk about 
warp theory. 

She, herself, ate little. She was 
content to look at them. The 
lieutenant, tall and strong, big- 



boned, dark-complexioned, 
square -faced, white even teeth. 
Sam, smalled-boned, fair-com- 
plexioned, hair bleached straw 
from the outdoor sun. He had 
been inclined to be a little stout 
when she first saw him, but now 
he had that muscular wiriness 
which comes with hard physical 
work — and clean living. His 
daughters would be delicate, 
lovely, yet strong. The lieuten- 
ant’s sons . 

She watched, in a kind of rap- 
ture, the ripple of muscles be- 
neath their shirts, the way the 
pillar of the neck arose from 
strong shoulders to support a 
well-shaped head, the way the 
muscles of jaws rippled under 
their lean cheeks as they chewed. 
The way their intelligent eyes 
flashed appreciation at each sa- 
vory mouthful. 

“It occurs to me, Sam,” Lt. 
Harper said as he washed down 
some turkey with a healthy quaff 
of wine. “We could give a little 
more attention to scraping up 
food for Miss Kitty to cook. Now 
you take this brown rice, for ex- 
ample, we could rig up a polish- 
ing mill so she’d have white 
rice . 

“Nonsense,” Miss Kitty said 
firmly. “All the proper food value 
lies in the brown covering. I will 
not have the children’s eating 
habits spoiled from the begin- 
ning . 



A WOMAN'S PLACE 



133 




Appalled, she realized what she 
had said. Both men stopped 
chewing and stared at her. 

“What children, Miss Kitty?” 
Lt. Harper asked, and he was 
looking at her intently. 

She dropped her eyes to her 
plate. She felt the red flush aris- 
ing around her neck, up into her 
face. She couldn’t face him. Yet, 
it had to be done. It must be 
made quite clear to him, both of 
them, that . 

“Our children,” she said dis- 
tinctly, and felt their eyes boring 
into the top of her head. “And I 
wish you both would stop calling 
me Miss Kitty, as if — as if you 
were kindergarten children and I 
was the old maid school teacher! 
All three of us are adults, men 
and a woman. In spite of what 
you may think, I am not a great 
deal older than either of you. 
There will be children! If it 
works out the way I plan, I be- 
lieve I do have time for at least 
six sons and daughters before I 
reach . before my barren 
years.” 

She heard Sam’s fork clatter 
down on the table top as he drop- 
ped it. She heard Lt. Harper’s 
feet scrape, as if he had been 
about to leap to his feet. Without 
seeing it, she almost felt them 
look at one another. 

Well, she had made it plain 
enough. 

But they didn’t say anything. 



Suddenly she could stand it no 
longer. Slowly, in dignity, she 
arose to her feet and without 
looking at them she walked, head 
down, to her door. Then she re- 
alized she had perhaps been too 
crisp, too businesslike about it 
all. A vision of the kind of women 
they must have known, the kind 
which would arouse their pas- 
sion, the kind which would make 
it all unmistakable . 

She had a flashing memory of 
a girl back in college, one smitten 
with a football hero, trying to 
captivate the hero, draw him to 
her. On impulse, Miss, Kitty imi- 
tated that girl now, and a little 
tableau she remembered. 

At her doorway she turned, and 
looked at them over her shoul- 
der. She lifted her shoulder so 
that it touched her chin. She 
drooped her eyes half shut. 

“My name is Katheryn,” she 
said, and she tried to make her 
voice husky instead of tremulous 
and frightened. “Call me Kathy, 
call me Kate, call me Kay.” 

Both men were staring at her 
with wide eyes and open mouths 
as she closed her door. She made 
sure there was no sound of a 
latch turning to discourage them. 

CHE undressed herself slowly, 
^ and, for the first time other 
than for bathing, completely. She 
felt grateful for the time they 
were giving her. No doubt they 



134 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




were talking it over, man to man, 
in the way of civilized, educated 
. She crawled in between the 
blankets, fresh and smelling of 
sunshine from being washed in 
the clear water of the lake. She 
was a little regretful she had no 
perfume; that was something 
they didn’t put into lifeboats. 

She waited. 

She heard the low rumble of 
male voices in the other room. 
They were undoubtedly discuss- 
ing it. She felt grateful relief that 
their voices had not risen. They 
were not quarreling over her — 
not yet. She did hope they would 
continue to be sensible. 

She heard one of the stools 
scrape on the rough split log 
floor. She caught her breath in a 
gasp, found her hands were 
clutching the covers and pulling 
them tightly up to her chin. She 
willed her hands to relax. She 
willed the tenseness out of her 
rigid body. 

She heard the other stool 
scrape. Surely they were not 
both . 

She heard their feet walking 
across the floor, the heavy steps 
of the lieutenant, the lighter, 
springier steps of Sam. She grit- 
ted her teeth and clenched her 
eyes tight shut. 

And then she heard the outer 
door close softly. 

Which one? Which had re- 
mained behind? 



She waited. 

Then she heard footsteps out- 
side. She tried to identify, by 
sound, which man was making 
the noise, but the shuffling of 
leaves was confusing, as if more 
than one person were walking 
outside. And where was the other 
man? Why had he made no 
sound in the outer room? Was he 
quietly drinking up the wine — 
first? Then, distinctly, she recog- 
nized two pairs of feet outside, 
going farther away, in the direc- 
tion of the men’s bunkhouse. 

She could not bear the sus- 
pense. She sprang out of bed 
clutching one of the blankets 
about her. Slowly, soundlessly, 
she opened her door a crack. She 
could see no one in the flickering 
firelight of the room. They had 
turned out the lights. Or — he 
had. She opened the door wide. 

It had been they, not he. Both 
men had gone. 

TNADVERTENTLY something 

between a sob and a hiccough 
rattled her throat. She choked 
back another. She would not give 
way to . rage? . frustration? 
. relief? . fear? 

Fear! 

She had seen the movies, she 
had read the stories, she had 
overheard boys. “1*11 fix you 
when we get outside! You meet 
me in the alley and I’ll show 
you!” 



A WOMAN'S PLACE 



135 




These two men. Were they 
going off into the darkness to set- 
tle a conflict which they had not 
been able to resolve through sen- 
sible agreement? There, under 
the trees in the moonlight, would 
they, denying all the progress of 
the sacred centuries, would they 
revert to the primitive, the sav- 
age; and like two rutting male 
animals rend and tear and battle 
with one another for the only 
female? 

Oh, no! No, they must not! 
There was no doubt that the 
lieutenant with his great, massive 
strength . But the human race 
of New Earth must have the fine 
sensitivity, the lithe grace of 
Sam’s kind, also! 

She tugged the blanket around 
her shoulders and ran toward the 
door. She must reach them, step 
in between them, even at the cost 
of receiving some of the blows 
upon herself, make them re- 
alize . 

She felt herself shivering as she 
opened the door, shivering as if 
with an ague. She felt her face 
burning, as if with a fever. Her 
teeth were chattering in anguish. 
She tried to still the noise of her 
teeth, to listen for those horrible 
sounds of silent men in a death 
conflict somewhere out there in 
the moonlight. 

Then she saw a chink of light 
through a crack in the wall of 
the bunkhouse, where the clay 



had dried and fallen away from 
the logs. 

In there? What were they do- 
ing in there? 

Instead of their fists and 
crushing arms, were they stalk- 
ing one another with knives? She 
remembered scenes from Western 
movies, the overturned tables, the 
crash of things thrown. Had some 
sense of chivalry still remained 
in the lieutenant, and he, know- 
ing Sam wouldn’t stand a chance 
in hand to hand conflict, devised 
some contest 'which would be 
more fair? 

There need be no contest. If 
only they would be sensible, work 
out an equitable schedule . 

Barefooted, she ran across the 
ground toward the bunkhouse. 
She had visions of herself throw- 
ing open the door, shocking them 
to stillness in a tableau of vio- 
lence. She was close now. She 
should be able to hear the crash- 
ing of their table and chairs. 

She could hear nothing at all. 
Was she too late? Even now, was 
one of them standing above the 
other, holding a dripping knife? 
What horrors might she run into, 
even precipitate, if she threw 
open the door? Caution, Kath- 
eryn! 

Instead, she crept up to the 
crack in the wall. Her teeth were 
chattering so hard, she had diffi- 
culty in holding her head still 
enough to peer through the slit 



136 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




of light. With her free hand, her 
shoulders were shaking so hard 
she had difficulty in clutching the 
blanket about her with the other, 
she grabbed her jaw and held on, 
to still her shaking. Her eyes 
focused on the scene inside the 
room. 

S HE had a three-quarter vision 
of each man and the table 
between them. They were dealing 
a greasy pack of cards! Were 
they going to gamble for her? 
Relief and shame intermingled in 
her reaction. She would have pre- 
ferred they settle it with more 
elemental ... It would have 
made it less . Yet, this way 
neither would be killed. Sons and 
daughters from both . 

“How are we going to tell her 
now?” Sam asked, as he picked 
up his cards. His voice came dis- 
tinctly through the wall crack. 

“We should have told her 
about our wives and families 
right at the start,” Harper an- 
swered morosely. “I don’t know 
why we didn’t. Except that, well, 
none of us have talked about 
things back home. She didn’t, 
and so we didn’t either.” 

“But I never dreamed Miss 
Kitty would start getting ideas,” 
Sam said in a heartsick voice. 
“I just never dreamed she . .” 
“We’re going to have to tell 
her,” Harper said resolutely. 
“We’ll just have to tell her that, 



well, there’s still hope and as long 
as there’s hope . .” 

Blindly, in an anguish of 
shame such as she had never 
known, Miss Kitty crept away 
from the bunkhouse, and stum- 
bled back to the cabin. Now she 
was shivering so violently she 
could hardly walk. The exposure 
to the night air, the nervous ten- 
sion, overwrought emotions . 

She could not remember get- 
ting back into the cabin, crawl- 
ing into bed. She knew only that 
a little later she was in bed, still 
shaking violently with a chill, 
burning with fever. 

She was awakened in the morn- 
ing with the sound of the axe 
chopping on wood. She dragged 
herself out of bed, forlorn, sick, 
filled with shame. Her head spun 
so wildly that she sank to her 
knees and lay it on the bed. Then 
her pride and her will forced her 
to her feet, and she drove herself 
to dress, to go into the big room, 
dig out glowing coals from be- 
neath ashes, put them in the little 
cook stove, pile fine slivers of 
resin-rich kindling on top of 
them, blow on them. 

Between painful breaths, she 
heard herself sobbing. Her teeth 
started chattering again, and 
there was a ringing in her ears. 
She heard the blows of the axe 
falling on the wood, and each 
blow transferred itself to the base 
of her skull. The ringing in her 



A WOMAN'S PLACE 



137 




ears grew louder and louder. 

She heard one of the men 
shout. It sounded like Sam. Had 
he hurt himself with the axe, 
gashed his leg or something? 
She’d always been afraid of that 
axe? She’d told them and told 
them to be careful! 

She pulled herself up from her 
knees there at the stove where 
she had been blowing on the 
coals. She must get out there, 
help him! That terrible buzzing 
in her head, that ringing in her 
ears. No matter, she must get out 
there to help him. 

She threw open the door and 
saw Sam running toward the life- 
ship. Had he lost his mind? The 
bandages were here. She had 
them here! She saw Lt. Harper 
come to the door of the bunk- 
house. He was still pulling on his 
pants. He started running toward 
the lifeship, too, cinching his belt 
as he ran. 

Then she realized that at least 
part of the ringing in her ears 
came from the lifeship. At first 
it had no meaning for her, then 
she remembered them talking 
about fixing up some kind of 
alarm, so that if they got a sig- 
nal through . 

She started running toward the 
lifeship. She stumbled, fell, got 
up, felt as light as a feather, as 
heavy as mercury. She crawled 
Up the steps of the lifeship, she 
clutched at the door. She heard 



Sam speaking very slowly, care- 
fully. 

“Do you read me? Is this 
Earth?" 

She saw his face. She knew the 
answer. 

And that was the last she 
knew, 

C ONSCIOUSNESS came back 
in little dribbles like a mon- 
tage — half reality and half night- 
mare of the insomniac. Lt. Har- 
per’s voice shouting at her with 
a roar like a waterfall, “My God, 
Miss Kitty, are you sick?” Black- 
ness. More shouting, Sam calling 
the lieutenant, something about 
a red flare in the sky. A lucid 
moment, when Sam was explain- 
ing to her that Earth had been 
given the warp coordinates, and 
had sent a red flare to see if they 
could get through. Then another 
gap. A heavy trampling of feet, 
a great many feet. Some kind of 
memory of a woman in white, 
sticking a thermometer in her 
mouth. The prick of a needle in 
her arm. The sense of being car- 
ried. A memory of knowing she 
was in a ship. A flash that was 
more felt than seen. 

Nightmares! All nightmares. 
She would wake up in a moment. 
She would get up, dress, go out 
and start a fire to heat water on 
the cookstove. She had planned 
to have coffee, a special treat 
from their almost exhausted 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




store. She would have coffee. The 
men would come in sheepish, 
evading her glance. 

Very well, she would simply 
tell them that she had misunder- 
stood, save them the embarrass- 
ment of telling her. She would 
not be the woman scorned. 

She moved her hands to throw 
back her blankets, and froze. Her 
fingers had not touched blankets, 
they had touched cool, slick 
sheets! Her eyes popped open. 

It had not been a nightmare, 
a wish fulfillment of escape. She 
was in a hospital room. A nurse 
was standing beside her bed, 
looking down at her. A comfort- 
ably motherly-looking sort of 
woman was speaking to her. 

“Well, now, Miss Kittredge, 
that’s much better!” the woman 
said. “So you will go gather wild 
rice in the swamp and get your 
bloodstream full of bugs!” But 
it was a professional kind of chid- 
ing, the same way she had talked 
to her kindergarten children when 
they’d got themselves into 
trouble. 

“Still,” the nurse chatted, “it’s 
made our pathologists mighty 
happy. They’ve been having 
themselves a ball analyzing the 
bugs you three managed to pick 
up. You got something close to 
malaria. The two men, healthy 
oxen, didn’t get anything at all. 
We had to let ’em out of quaran- 
tine in three days.” 



M ISS KITTY just looked at 
her in a sort of unthinking 
lassitude. She was still trying to 
make the reality seem real. The 
nurse helped a little. She turned 
to her cart and produced a white 
enamel, flat container. She slid 
it under the top sheet. 

“Upsy-daisy now, Miss Kitt- 
redge,” she said firmly. “It’s time 
you started cooperating a little.” 
Yes, that brought her back to 
reality. But she still didn’t say 
anything. 

“Although we might as well not 
have let ’em out of quarantine,” 
the nurse grumbled. “They’ve 
just been living out there in the 
waiting room for a solid week, 
buttonholing everybody from 
doctors down to orderlies asking 
about you.” 

She gave a soft wolf whistle. 
“Whew, imagine having not 
just one guy but two of ’em, ab- 
solutely crazy about you. Just 
begging to see you, hold your 
hand a little. Two beautiful men 
like that! You ready to see thfcm 
soon?” 

Miss Kitty felt a rush of shame 
again. In the cabin she would 
have been forced to face them, 
but not now. 

“No,” she said firmly. “I never 
want to see them again.” 

“Well, now, let me tell you 
something, Miss Kittredge,” the 
nurse said, and this time there 
was a note of seriousness. “One 



140 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




of the symptoms of this sickness 
you picked up is that it makes 
you talk. Gal, you have talked a 
blue streak for the last week. We 
know everything, everything that 
happened, everything you 
thought about. The doctor under- 
stood how you might feel about 
things. So he told the lieutenant 
and Mr. Eade that you had got 
bitten about the time you were 
up in the rice swamp, and that 
you hadn’t been responsible for 
anything you’d said for the last 
three days back there on New 
Earth.” 

Miss Kitty felt a flood of re- 
lief. 

“Did they believe the doctor?” 
she asked hesitantly. 

“Sure they believed him,” the 
nurse answered. “Sure they did. 
But you wanna know something? 
I’ve talked to those two men. 
And I’ve just got myself an idea 
that it wouldn’t have made a 
particle of difference in the way 
they feel about you even if they 
didn’t believe it. You’re tops with 
those two guys, lady. Absolutely 
tip-top tops. The way you pitch- 
ed in there, carried your share of 
things . 

She slipped the pan out from 
under the sheets, and put it into 
a compartment of the cart. 

“You wanna know something 
else? I don’t think you were out 
of your head at all when you 
propositioned those two guys. I 



think you were showing some 
good female sense, maybe for the 
first time in your life. And I 
think they know you were. 

“You think it over, Miss Kitt- 
redge. If I know you — and I 
ought to after listening to you 
rave day after day — you’ve got 
what it takes. You want my ad- 
vice? You go right on being a 
normal female. Don’t you be silly 
enough to get back into that 
warped, twisted, frustrated kind 
of a man-hater you always 
thought you were. 

“I gotta go now. You think it 
over. But not too long. Those two 
guys are going to be mighty, 
mighty hurt if they find out 
you’re conscious and won’t see 
them.” 

She went out the door, pushing 
her cart in front of her. 

1%/TISS Kitty relaxed her neck, 
willed the tenseness out of 
her body, and just lay for a while 
thinking of nothing. A gust, a 
rattle of raindrops, called her at- 
tention to the window. They had 
put her on the ground floor. She 
was able to see through the win- 
dow to the street outside. The rain 
was pelting down, like that first 
rain they’d had there on New 
Earth. How chagrined the boys 
had looked when the roof started 
leaking in a do 2 en places! 

She felt a warm sense of relief, 
of gratitude, that she could re- 



A WOMAN'S PLACE

member them without shame. 
The nurse had been right, of 
course. Probably the doctors had 
planted that particular nurse in 
her room, anticipating her return 
to consciousness, anticipating the 
necessity for a little mental ther- 
apy. 

Good female sense. With such 
a semantic difference from good 
male sense! The mind of a man 
and a woman was not the same. 
She knew that now. And she real- 
ized that deeply, hidden from 
her own admittance, she had al- 
ways known it. And the nurse’s 
good earthy expression — “propo- 
sitioning those two guys” — ap- 
proval that it had been natural 
and right. And another expres- 
sion, “the way you pitched in 
there, carried your share of 
things.” 

Carried your share of things! 
That meant more than just cook- 
ing, mending, cleaning. More than 
just seeing that the race con- 
tinued, too; although it somehow 
tied in with all these things. 

She lay in her bed, watching 
the rain through the window, 
getting comfort from the soft, 
drumming sound. Along the 
street she could see people slosh- 
ing through the film of water 
underfoot. She watched the scene 
of turned -up collars, pulled-down 
hatbrims, bobbing umbrellas, as 
if it were something apart from 
her, and yet a part of her. She 



began to get a sense of rare vi- 
sion, an understanding which she 
knew was more complete than 
any intellectual abstraction she 
had ever managed. She began to 
get a woman’s sense of purpose, 
completely distinct from that of 
a man. 

S HE recalled once reading of 
an incident where an Okla- 
homa oil millionaire had built 
a huge mansion ; then, because his 
squaw did not know how to make 
a home within it, they pitched 
their tepee in the front grounds, 
to live there, unable to feel at 
home in anything else. 

Yes, too often the mansions of 
science came in for a similar 
treatment. The vast rooms of 
ideas, the great halls of expan- 
sion, the limitless ceilings of chal- 
lenge, the wide expanses of 
speculation; all these things 
which would exalt Man into a 
truly great existence were denied, 
put to no use beyond mere gad- 
getry. And the mass of human 
beings still huddled in their 
cramped and grimy little tepees 
of ancient syndromes, only there 
feeling at home. 

It was the fault of the women. 
They had not kept up with the 
men. Those who attempted it 
tried to be men, to prove them- 
selves as good a man as any man, 
the way she had done. 

They had missed the real point 



142

entirely, every single bit of it. 

The male was still functioning 
in the way males always had. 
There was no essential difference 
between the cave man who climb- 
ed a new mountain and explored 
a new valley and brought back 
a speared deer to throw down 
at the entrance of his home cave; 
no difference between him and 
the modern explorer of science 
who, under similar hardships, 
brought back a bright and rich 
new knowledge. 

But the ancient cave woman 
had not failed. She had known 
what to do with the deer to 
strengthen and secure the future 
of the race. 

And what about New Earth? 

Lt. Harper and Sam had talk- 
ed about the possibility of mil- 
lions of Earths, each infinitesi- 
mally removed from the other, 
and if they could bridge the gap 
to one, they might bridge it to 
an uncountable number. Perhaps 
there were millions of others, but 
for her there was only one New 
Earth. 

Would the processions of colo- 
nists going there spoil it? Would 
the women going there see in it 
a great mansion? Or, instead, 
would they simply go there to 
escape here— -escape from exhaus- 
tion, failure, anguish, bitterness — 
and, as always, take these things 
along with them? Would they 
still live in grimy little syndromes 



of endless antagonism, bickering 
in their foolish frustrations, be- 
cause they had no wisdom about 
what to do with this newly spear- 
ed deer? 

Oh, not on New Earth! 

Suddenly Miss Kitty knew 
what she must do. If that one 
particular mansion needed some- 
one to make it into a home, why 
not herself? And who had a better 
right? 

Somewhere, there, perhaps that 
very one striding along under the 
eaves of that building across the 
street, with his hatbrim pulled 
down, leaning against the rain, 
somewhere, close, there must be 
a man who could share her res- 
olution and her dream. A man 
of the same breed as the lieuten- 
ant and Sam, a man who carried 
his head high, his shoulders 
back, who had keen, intelligent 
eyes, and laughter. 

Yes, now she wanted to see 
the two men after all, and meet 
their lucky wives, and see their 
children, the kind of children she 
might have had. 

Might yet have! 

At a flash of memory, she smil- 
ed a little ruefully, and yet with 
an inner peace. 

‘T am not so old,” she repeated 
in a whisper. “I still have time 
for at least a half dozen sons 
and daughters before — before my 
barren years.”

A WOMAN'S PLACE

( Continued from page 4) 

I don’t know, Maje. You fig- 
ure it out. But don’t just gabble 
along psuedo - scientifically. Be 
entertaining! You demand it of 
me: okay, I demand it of you. 

What else is on my mind? Well, 
books are piling up, but they 
obstinately won’t make complete 
editorials. The Tastemakers by 
Russell Lynes (Harper), for ex- 
ample, proves a quote from Ar- 
thur A. Houghton, Jr., of Corning 
Glass: 

“In our modern industrial so- 
ciety, it is the professional de- 
signer who increasingly is deter- 
mining the appearance of our 
physical environment. The indi- 
vidual is less and less able to 
participate in this determination.” 

That’s bad? From typewriters 
to toasters, merchandise looks 
and functions better as a result. 
They’ve weaned us from beaded 
lampshades, square cars, rhine- 
.stone houses, Rosa Bonheur and 
Venuses with clocks in their bel- 
lies — and have you admired the 
way packaging engineers box 
dishes and glassware so even the 
post office can’t do its usual crea- 
tive damage? 

The tastemakers may fumble 
here and there, but I’m not a bit 
afraid to say I’m for them! 

Isn't One Wife Enough? by 
Kimball Young (Holt) explores 
Mormon polygamy, a subject 
that writers find tiresomely fas- 



cinating. If it appeals to them, 
they should have their heads ex- 
amined or examine this book. 

Bergen Evans calls Mormon 
polygamy “multiple monogamy” 
because each wife had to have 
her own home. But it’s that even 
in a harem. Men who submit to 
polygamy deserve to be called 
saints, for the setup is always 
costly, bothersome and harrow- 
ingly complex. As you’d expect, 
most Mormon men cravenly 
avoided it. 

Then there’s Sea, Sun and Sky 
by Irving P. Krick and Roscoe 
Fleming (Lippincott), a fine 
meteorological source book and 
plain good reading. It’s the kind 
of thing that can’t be discussed 
without quotes and, once started, 
I probably wouldn’t be able to 
stop. Read it for yourself, Maje, 
and you’ll see what I mean. 
(There’s no mention of a possible 
world without any weather, but 
I guess that would be asking too 
much.) 

Speaking of not being able to 
stop quoting, all I can do is sug- 
gest Fred Allen’s Treadmill to 
Oblivion (Simon & Schuster), 
which I zipped through because 
I damned well wanted to and 
practically all of it is both hilari- 
ously and shrewdly quotable. 

You see what I mean, Maje? 
Sometimes you simply can’t put 
together an entertaining editorial.
