IF • Editorial 



Where are 

T he other day an editor from a 
national news magazine called 
up to find out what he could 
about the present activities of some 
•f the Grand Old Names of science 
fiction. What he had in mind was a 
•idebar to run in connection with 
a story on Kariner IV and its Mars 
photographs, and what he wanted to 
do was tell about what science fic- 
tion’s old masters were doing these 
days. “What about Doc Smith?” he 
aaked. “His newest story, Skylark 
DvjQuesne, is running currently in 
If,” said we. “A. E. Van Vogt?” 
•^ntributing regularly to the same 
magazine.” “Well, how about Isaac 
Aafanov?” “Got a couple of his stor- 
lea, too — one in the October 
€Maxy, one a little later.” “Hein- 
lein?” “Oh, sure — his next series 
will start off 1966 for us.” 

And so it went. Murray Leinster, 
Jack Williamson, Lester del Rey, 
Philip Jose Farmer — all the big 
names of some decades ago; if they 
were still alive, they were still writ- 
ing science fiction. (When the side- 
bar finally appeared, it had only 
two names, Hugo Gernsback and 
Horace Gold — and as a matter of 
fact, we have a Horace Gold story 
coming up in Galaxy too!) 

There was a superstition current 
a few years ago that most of science- 
fiction’s best writers had given up 
the field in favor of greener pas- 
tures. It may even have been true 
— briefly. But the record shows that 
it certainly isn’t true any more! 

A ctually something has been hap- 
pening among science-fiction’s 
top writers, however. The greener 



they now ? 

pastures are there, and the sf au- 
thors have been grazing in them. 
Robert Bloch, Harlan Ellison, Jer- 
ome Bixby, Ray Bradbury, Arthur 
C. Clarke and a few others are find- 
ing their time more and more taken 
up with writing motion-picture and 
television scripts. Major magazines 
like Playboy and Holiday have pre- 
empted a lot of the working time 
of writers like Alfred Bester, Algis 
Budrys, Frank M. Robinson and so 
on. A fair proportion of those with 
advanced degrees — Jack William- 
son, Isaac Asimov, Cordwainer 
Smith, John R. Pierce and James 
V. McConnell, for instance — are 
putting in most of their effort* on 
teaching, or research, or factual 
science writing; and even the re- 
latively simon-pures, like Robert A. 
Heinlein and the undersigned, find 
their time more and more occupied 
with participating in seminars, 
making radio and TV appearances. 

But let no one wonder where sci- 
ence fiction’s great writers of yes- 
teryear may be. Nearly all of them 
— plus a great deal of new blood, 
as witness our “Firsts” — are right 
at their typewriters right now, writ- 
ing science fiction. It may not pay 
off as well in gold or glory as other 
pursuits open to them, but it has 
its advantages. First, it has the 
most alert audience in the world. 
Second, it is what they do best. And 
third — it is the only kind of writing 
that imposes no tabus or restrictions 
of its own. In science fiction, the 
sky’s no limit — and that’s why 
there will never be a lack of talented 
and capable writers for it!

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some— but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature's laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid~ 
den processes of man*s mind, and the 
mastery of lifers problems. Once shroud-

facts remain a useful heritage for the

RETIEF'S WAR 

by KEITH LAUMER 

Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



Nice planefi The natives were 
half machines — the government 
was halt dead — and the Terrans 
were halt out of their minds! 



I 

J ame Retief, Second Secretary and 
Consul of the Terrestrial Em- 
bassy to Quopp, paused in his stroll 
along the Twisting Path of Sublime 
Release He admired the blaze of 
early morning sunlight on the stained 
glass window of a modest grog shop 
wedged between a stall with a sign 
in jittery native script announcing 
Bargain Prices in Cuticula Inlays, 



and the cheery facade of The Idle 
Hour Comfort Station, One Hundred 
Stalls, No Waiting. He took out a 
long cigar of the old-fashioned type 
still hand-rolled on Jorgensen’s 
Worlds. He glanced back along the 
steep, narrow street. Among the 
crowd of brilliantly colored Quop- 
pina — members of a hundred related 
native species mingling freely here 
in the Great Market of Ixix — the 
four Terrans who had been trailing 



6 



him for the past half hour stood 
out drably. 

Retief drew on the cigar, savoring 
the aroma, turned and stepped 
through the low arch into the tav- 
ern. From a high stool within the 
raised ring-bar at the center of the 
gaily lit chamber, the bar keeper — 
a medium-sized, short-abdomened 
individual of the Herpp tribe, with 
chipped wing-cases of faded baby 
blue and four dextrous arms of 
bristly wine-red, on one of which 
a Terr an wristwatch was strapped — 
manipulated the controls of the dis- 
penser console. He exchanged ban- 
ter with the customers, made change 
and kept a pair of eyes on the free 
lunch simultaneously. As he saw 
Retief, he tilted his anterior anten- 
nae in friendly greeting. 

“I am Gom-Goo, and I dance 
the dance of welcome,” he susur- 
rated in Quopp trade dialect, his 
voice reminiscent of fingernails on 
a blackboard. “What’ll it be, Re- 
tief?” 

“I’m Retief, and I dance the 
dance of Glad Arrival,” the dip- 
lomat replied in the same tongue. 
“How about a shot of Bacchus 
brandy?” 

“Red or black?” 

“Black.” The other customers 
made room as Retief moved up, 
undipped a carefully charred wood- 
en bowl from the serving panel, got 
it under the proper bright-plated 
nozzle just in time to catch the tar- 
colored syrup as it jetted forth. 

“That’s pretty good stuff,” Gom- 
Goo said. He lowered his voice. 
“But for a real kick, you ought to try 
a shot of Hellrose — cut ten to one. 



of course. That’ll put a charge om 
your plates.” 

“1 tried it once. We Terries liki 
our sugar fermented.” 

“Sourballs?” The Herpp indicated 
an assortment of pea-sized lumps of 
yellow, white, purple and green. 

Retief shook his head. ‘T prefer 
salt peanuts to saltpetre,” he con- 
fided. 

“Well, every tribe to its own 
poison.” 

“Here’s oil in your crankcase,** 
Retief toasted formally, nibbling the 
brandy. 

“Oil,” Gom-Goo responded. “Yo« 
haven’t been in lately, Retief. Been 
dormant?” 

“No more than usual, Gom-Go<v 
Ambassador Longspoon’s been u»- 
posing non-union hours on the staff. 
I’m afraid. Wouldn’t do to let the 
Groaci steal a march on us and get 
a Bolshoi-type ballet theatre built 
before we can get a Yankee-stadium 
type sports arena off the drawing 
board.” 

G om-Goo worked his dorsal man- 
dibles in the gesture that ex- 
pressed courteous skepticism. 
“Frankly, Retief, we Quoppina 
aren’t much interested in watching 
Terries hobble around. After all, 
with only two legs and no wings ...” 
“I know; but it’s traditional in 
these diplomatic competitions to 
build something conspicuously in- 
appropriate.” 

Gom-Goo tilted his oculars 
toward the door, where a pair of 
Quoppina with highly polished 
black carapacos were rolling past, 
twirling night-sticks. 



RETIEPS WAt

“Speaking of Terry programs, 
Retiet, just between you and me, 
what’s behind this business of buff- 
ing up these Voion ne’er-do-wells 
and setting them to cruising the 
streets waving clubs at the rest of 
us?” 

“Well, Gom-Goo, it appears that 
in some quarters the view is held 
that you Quoppina are a little too 
fond of brawling, anarchy and 
duelling in the streets to qualify as 
natural democrats. Ergo, a native 
police force.” 

“Uh-huh. But why pick the Voion 
for the job? Their tribe’s made its 
Kving by waylaying honest Quoppina 
in the back alleys ever since the 
Great Egg first hatched.” 

A heavy foot clumped behind 
Retief. He turned to find the four 
Terrans ringing him in, ominous 
expressions on their weathered fea- 
tures. 

“We’re just in from the Trading 
Post at Rum Jungle,” the lean, scar- 
faced member of the quartet said 
flatly. “We want to have a little talk 
with you. Mister.” He put his left 
fist carefully against the palm of his 
right hand and twisted it, looking 
around nervously. 

Retief nodded. “Go ahead,” he 
said pleasantly. A large man with 
thick, protuberant ears and thin 
sandy hair eased the scarred man 
aside. 

‘‘Not in this dump,” he said in a 
voice like a cannonball rolling down- 
stairs. “Outside.” 

“If it’s a private matter, maybe 
you’d better drop by my office.” 

“We already been to the Embassy. 
Talked to some bird named Mag- 



nan,” the big man said. “He ac^cd 
like his lace drawers was itching 
him; no joy there.” 

44T^on’t argue with this chump, 
JLy Big Leon,” a squatty fellow 
with a bluish chin and a steel front 
tooth advised. “Bring him along.” 
The bartender leaned over and 
buzzed sharply. “My name is Gom- 
Goo,” he stated. “I danctk — ” 
“Better get your wiring checked, 
low-pockets,” Scar-face cut him off. 
“Sounds like you got a short in your 
talk-box.” He jerked his head at 
Retief. “Let’s walk Mister.” 

“I haven’t quite finished my 
drink,” Retief said mildly. “Why 
don’t you go stand outside? I’ll be 
along presently.” 

The fourth man, yet to be heard 
from, edged closer. “Ah, sir, we 
have a problem,” he began. “We — ” 
“Skip it Jerry,” Scar-face snapped. 
He hooked a thumb over his shoul- 
der, glowered at Retief. “Outside, 
you, like Big Leon said.” 

“Sorry,” Retief said. “Some other 
time, maybe.” 

Scar-face narrowed his eyes, 
reached a large-knuckled hand for 
Relief’s collar; Retief leaned aside, 
caught the hand and flipped it over, 
his fingers against the palm, his 
thumb against the scarred knuckles. 
He doubled it back over the wrist 
and Scar-face went to his knees 
with a yowl. Retief tsked. 

“A very poor lead. Lefty,” he said 
reproachfully. “It’s a good thing I 
wasn’t an enemy of yours.” 

“Hey,” the big man said stepping 
in. “Let him up.” 

Retief looked at the wide face 

IF 




that to-i' c ! mx il.ice by an inch. 
“Why ao liicy caii you Big Leon?” 
Big Leon set himselt. “Pul Sey- 
mour down and I’ll show you,” he 

frated. 

Relief shifted his grip, lifted the 
•carred man clear off the floor, 
hoisted him chest-high. “Here you 
have him,” he offered, and tossed 
him at the big man. Leon staggered 
hack, o///ed, thrust Seymour aside, 
frowned, doubled a large fist and 
moved in. 

There was a shrill rasp of sound. 
A thick, five-foot Quoppina with a 
glistening black carapace decked out 
in elaborate silver ornaments rolled 
between Relief and Big Leon. 

“Outside, foreign grubs!” the in- 
truder keened. He waved a long 
billy-club of black wood and jabbed 
it at the scar-faced man, who had 
•tumbled to his feet. There were 
other club-wielders behind the first — 
two, three, half a dozen or more, 
all wearing the new black and silver 
trappings of the CDT-sponsored 
Federal Police. The Voion captain 
waved his palps, giving Relief a 
glimpse down a yellow-green throat 
set with silvery needles. 

“All of you are under arrest,” 
he rasped. “Place your manipulative 
members above your sense-organ 
clusters and proceed hence!” 
“What’s the charge?” Relief asked 
in the Voion dialect. 

“Trespassing in forbidden terri- 
tory, alien. Not that it matters! The 
example may remind your fellows 
to remain in the ghetto graciously 
assigned to them by the indulgence 
of the Planetary Government!” 

“Just a minute,” tim bar-keeper 



interrupted from his perch above. 
“I am Gom-Goo and — ” 

“Silence, panderer to alien perver- 
sions,” the Voion snapped. “Or Til 
find dungeon space for you, too!” 

T he other Voion were unlimbering 
clubs now. Over their heads Re- 
lief caught Big Leon’s eye, jerked his 
head minutely to the right; the big 
man narrowed his eyes, nodded 
quickly. As the Voion before Retief 
brought his club back for a jab to 
the sternum, Leon reached, caught 
the alien by the upper pair of arms, 
lifted him clear of the floor, whirled 
him and slammed him at his fellows. 

Two of them went over with a 
crash. Retief spun, intercepted an 
eager junior closing in from the left, 
caught him by his vestigal wing- 
cases, sent him reeling back to col- 
lide with his partner as Scar-face 
feinted, twisted the club from the 
two-pronged grip of the nearest cop, 
ducked and jammed it through the 
spokes of the alien’s yard-high main 
wheels. 

The victim stopped with a screech 
and a twanging of broken spokes. 
Big Leon met a second charging 
Voion with a roundhouse swipe, 
yelled as his fist glanced off the 
armored thorax, then landed a blow 
that spim the creature aside just as 
the sole undamaged Voion struck 
Big Leon a vicious blow behind the 
ear. Leon turned with a roar, picked 
up the cop bodily and slammed him 
against the bar-keeper’s podium. 

“Here!” the bar-keeper shrilled. 
“I am Gom-Goo and I dance the 
Dance of Distress!” 

“Let’s get out of here!” Scar- face 

IF 



10 




panted. He ducked aside as a Voion’s 
club whistled, charged for the door. 
Quoppina of all sizes and colors 
scattered before him. Leon aimed a 
blow at the cop renewing the attack. 
Jerry took the arm of the fourth 
Tcrran, staggering from a bloody cut 
across the scalp, and plunged through 
the crowd. Retief, backed against 
the podium by the last two Voion 
•till in action, keeping their distance 
and swinging their clubs in whistling 
arcs, plucked a tall bottle from a 
display, got in a hearty crack across 
the head of one as Gom-Goo leaned 
down and laid the other out. 

“Retief!” the Horpp called above 
the chatter of the clientel who had 
been enjoying the free show. “I am 
Gom-Goo and I dance the Dance 
of Apology.” 

“This dance is on me,” Retief 
panted. “I think I’d better be off 
now, Gom-Goo. Sorry about the 
damages.” 

“It was entirely the fault of Jfiese 
|acks-in-office.” The bartender 
clashed his wingcase in agitation. 
•‘Interfering in a friendly dispute 
among cash customers! Yum-TukI” 
He signalled to his two table waiters. 
“Haul these Voion trouble-makers 
out into the alley, to survive or not, 
just as they please.” He leaned over 
to eye the one Big Leon had thrown 
against the podium. “As for this 
fellow, stuff him in the incinerator. 
He’s shouldered his last free citizen 
off the parking-ledge.” 

“We’d better dust. Mister,” Leon 
•aid. “That Bug was a cop and he’s 
got plenty of pals.” 

There was a distant clanging of 
gongs. 



“You’d best transfer the scene of 
your diversions elsewhere for the 
nonce, Retief,” Gom-Goo called. 
“One of these spoil-sports has sum- 
moned his fellow blackguards.” 
“We were just leaving. Thanks for 
tapping that last fellow; he was 
getting too close for comfort.’’ 

“My pleasure, Retief. The rascals 
have been getting pushier by the 
day. They’re up to something, mark 
my words! And remember: After 
the wheels, the juncture between the 
parietal plates is the best spot to 
go for on a Voion.” 

“I’ll remember that. Ta-ta.” 

II 

I n a quieter grog shop half a mile 
from the scene of the action, Rc- 
tief and the four Terrans found a 
table at the back of the room from 
which they could keep an eye on 
the street. Through the wide, door- 
less arch, Voion cops could be seen 
hurrying past, grim and businesslike 
in their black and silver trappings. 
Big Leon blew on his skinned fist, 
looked at Retief almost shyly. 

“Sorry about the rough stuff, uh. 
Mister, uh . .” 

“Retief. No apology needed. I see 
now why they call you Big Leon.” 
Leon nodd^. “You looked pretty 
good in there yourself. Mister. May- 
be those Bugs’ll think about it before 
they tackle another bunch of Ter- 
ries.” 

“What’s got into them Bugs?” the 
scarred man demanded. “They been 
giving us a hard time out in the 
field, but I figured they’d be mind- 
ing their manners here in town.” 



lETIEF^S WAR 



11 




“That’s what we came here to 
talk about,” Big Leon said. “Some- 
thing’s stirring the Voion tribe up. 
1 thought it was just us planters and 
traders they were out to get, but 
they’ve got the whole town sewed 
up like a dead sailor.” 

“We pretty near didn’t get into 
the city,” the steel-toothed man said. 
“There’s a patrol around the port. 
A man could get the idea he wasn’t 
welcome.” 

“The new police force was de- 
signed to bring law and order to 
Quopp,” Retief said. “According to 
the official T.O. there are supposed 
to be no more than a hundred of 
them assigned to the city, with 
smaller detachments at the major 
trading towns.” 

“A hundred my Uncle Edgar,” 
Leon growled. “ITie whole town’s 
swarming with ’em — and there 
must be another ten thousand be- 
tween here and Rum Jungle.” 

“Yes, I’d say our friends the 
Voion have answered the call to 
civic duty in surprising numbers,” 
Retief said. 

“They say Longspoon’s the one 
behind it,” Scarface said. “Some- 
times I wonder whose side you CDT 
boys are on.” 

“The motivation of the diplomat 
is an enigma that even his best 
friend, if he had one, would be hard 
put to define,” Retief confided. 
“Technically, the Corps Diplomati- 
que Terrestrienne is dedicated to the 
protection of Terran interests. Gal- 
axy-wide. Of course, figuring out 
what those interests really are can 
get a little complicated.” 

“Like equipping local cops with 



clubs to pound Terry heads, using 
fees squeezed out of Terry business- 
men,” Seymour growled. 

“What does the Corps want here, 
anyway?” Leon demanded. “Quopp 
was doing all right — with a little 
help from Terry free enterprise. 
Then along comes a bunch of CDT 
Johnnies getting everything organiz- 
ed, and all of a sudden us Terries 
are undesirable aliens.” 

R etief refilled glasses. “Admitted- 
ly, some of the measures select- 
ed by our Chief of Mission may 
seem paradoxical at first glance. 
But that’s just because you haven’t 
entered into the spirit of the game. 
All of the measures Ambassador 
Longspoon has taken — restrictions 
on private enterprise by Terrans, 
establishment of the Planetary Po- 
lice, free goods for the indigent, sub- 
sidies for Voion commercial enter- 
prise, and the rest — are designed 
to bring peace and plenty to the 
downtrodden locals whom you fel- 
lows have been exploiting.” 

“What do you mean, exploiting?” 
Big Leon’s fist hit the table. “Why, 
a hundred years ago, when the first 
Terries hit Quopp, there was noth- 
ing here but wild Bugs living in 
grass huts and eating each other. We 
laid out the towns, built trails, start- 
ed ’em in on a little cottage industry 
and inter-tribal trade. We brought 
in electronics men to be country 
G.P.’s, developed new lines of mer- 
chandise to make life more beautiful 
for the Quopp in the street and 
taught ’em the idea of civilization. 
Sure, we made a good profit — but 
they’ve gotten their money’s worth!” 



12 



IF 




“Still, Leon, now that you’ve put 
Quopp on the star maps, competition 
has set in. Our friends the Groaci 
aren t going to let this world drift 
into the Terry camp without a 
struggle. They’ve set up a string of 
trading posts along the other coast 
of Continent One, and they’re doing 
a brisk trade in miniature Tri-D’s, 
artificial limbs and wheels, electron- 
ic Mah Jong sets — ” 

“Direct competition with usi” 
Jerry burst out. “The copycats!” 

“Of course,” Retief went on, “no 
self-respecting diplomat could let the 
challenge pass without making an 
effort to out-enlighten the opposition. 
Whatever the Groaci do, we have 
to do bigger.” 

“Why?” Seymour grunted. 

ii^lll^hy does a golfer have to hit 
the golf ball?” Retief ri- 
posted. “Such is the challenge of 
diplomacy.” 

“But why this sudden compulsion 
to unite the planet under a single 
government? — and with the Voion 
in charge, of all people!” Jerry 
looked indignant. 

“You know we can’t even travel 
inland to look over the markets?” 
Big Leon said. 

“You know why? The Voion. 
They’re all over like a land-lubber’s 
lunch — waving clubs and telling its 
where we can and can’t go!” 

“Longspoon’s making a mistake, 
backing the Voion,” Big Leon said. 
“There’s not a bug on the planet 
doesn’t hate their main windings. 
Slaves and dope-runners, con artists, 
highway robbers and second-story 
men — that’s what they were, until 



this idea of reforming ’em and put- 
ting badges on ’em came along.” 
“His Excellency envisions the day 
when a trained cadre of reformed 
Voion will lead the newly enlight- 
ened masses to a new era of plan- 
etary unity,” Retief explained. “Or 
so he frequently says.” 

“Retief, how long you been here 
on Quopp?” Leon inquired. 

“Only a few weeks. I’m afraid.” 
“You talk the dialects pretty 

good.” 

“I’ve spent a few hours on the 
encephalotapes.” 

“Uh-huh,” Leon nodded. “Well, 

I was born here, Retief. Hell, I 

haven’t been off the planet half 

a dozen times in my life. And I can 
tell you — these devils have got 
something up their sleeve!” 

“I’m inclined to agree. Their po- 
lice badges seem to have gone to 
their heads.” 

“It ain’t just that,” Seymour said. 
“There’s something in the wind! We 
saw it, out in the jungle — and now 
here in town! It’s getting ready to 
pop! Pushing Terries around — 
that’s bad medicine. Mister!” 

“And I’ll tell you something else,” 
the steel-toothed man said. “Those 
bugs are tapping CDT shipments at 
the port — in broad daylight!” 
Retief frowned. “You’re sure of 
that?” 

“Been down to the port lately?” 
Big Leon inquired. 

“Not in the past month.” 

“Come on,” Leon rose. “Let’s go 
take a look-see. There’s a CDT ship- 
ment on the pad right now big 
enough to put half the Terries on 
Quopp out of business.” As he stood,

a buzzing three-inch yellow green 
flyer sailed by, settled to a puddle 
ol spilled hquor on the floor, dig 
Leon raised a size thirteen shoe — 

“Don’t do it,” Retief said. “He 
probably needs a drink as bad as 
we did.” 

“That’s just a Phip,” Seymour 
said. “You talk like they was hum- 
an. 

“You never can tell,” Retief said, 
skirting the small creature. “He just 
might be somebody’s Cousin 
George.” 

O utside, the five Teirans hailed 
two massive peach-colored 
Wumblums, mounted to the creaking 
velvet-lined seats strapped to the 
heavy creatures’ backs, relaxed as 
their mounts trundled off on broad 
leather-shod wheels toward the space- 
port, groaning up the steep slopes, 
puffing down the declines, shouting 
for way among the thronging Quop- 
pina packing the route. 

Clear of the main shopping streets, 
the Wumblums made better time, 
wheeling along briskly under the 
crisp morning sky. Overhead, the 
glaring crescent of loop, Quopp’s 
sister world, swung toward its twice- 
daily eclipse of the distant sun, a 
blinding point of white light casting 
short mid-morning shadows across 
the intricately surfaced buildings 
that thrust up everywhere like giant, 
lumpy loaves of pastel-toned bread. 

“You gents coming back?” Re- 
liefs mount inquired in a voice like 
the E-string on a bass cello. It tilted 
an auditory receptor to pick up the 
reply over the noise of wheels on 
pavement. 



“Not right away,” Retief said. 
“Better not wait for us.” 

“I’ll stick around anyway. Voom- 
Voom’s the name. Ask for me when 
you’re ready to go. Not much ac- 
tion this morning. All these Zilk and 
Jackoo in town from the villages; 
they’d wear out their wheels rub- 
bernecking before they’d hail a ride. 
And these Voion cops all over the 
place — they’re not helping business 
any.” 

The Wumblum behind Retief ’i 
swung out, came alongside. “Looks 
like we got company.” Big Leon 
called, pointing over his shoulder 
with a large, blunt thumb. 

Retief glanced back. A pair of 
Voion were trailing fifty yards be- 
hind, black shells glistening, light 
winking from their recently applied 
Police insignia. 

“There are two more flanking us 
on the right,” Retief said. “I’d guess 
we’re covered on the left, too. They 
don’t want us to be lonely.” 

“Maybe you’d better cut out of 
here,” Leon suggested. “I guess 
they’re still mad. Me and the boys’ll 
handle this.” 

“It’s a nice day for a drive,” Re- 
tief said. “I wouldn’t think of miss- 
ing it.” 

The Wumblum took a quick look 
back at Retief. “Some of those 
Voion giving you gents trouble?” 

“They’re trying. I’ll concede that, 
Voom-Voom.” 

“Don’t worry about a thing, boss. 
I’ll say a word to my side-kick 
Rhum-Rhum, and we’ll lead those 
grub-eaters down a couple of side 
streets to a cul-de-sac I know and 
work ’em over for you.” 



RETIEF'S WAR

*‘That’s friendly of you, old tim- 
er, but we don’t have time for any 
more horseplay today.” 

“All part of the service,” Voom- 
Voom said. 

T he port came into view as the 
party emerged from the twist- 
ing avenue: a hundred-acre expanse 
of hilly ground, ringed by a sagging 
wire fence, paved and scabbed over 
with a maze of flimsy temporary 
structures, some now nearly a cen- 
tury old, among which the tall 
shapes of scattered vessels thrust up. 

As Retief watched, a vast black 
shadow swept down the hillside be- 
yond the ships. It rushed across the 
port blanking out the gleam of sun 
on chromalloy and concrete and cor- 
rugated aluminum, then enveloped 
them, plunging the street into ab- 
rupt, total darkness. Retief looked 
up; the great fire-edged disk of loop 
loomed black against the midnight 
blue sky. Voom-Voom lowered his 
head, and the beam of dusty light 
from his luminescent organ cut a 
path through the gloom ahead. 

“You know, you Terries have 
done us Quoppina a lot of good,” 
he said, slowing now to pick his 
way with more care. “Like the fo- 
cusing lenses for us Wumblums’ 
headlights. A real boon. And the 
rubber wheel-shoes some of the fel- 
lows wear; a useful item. And the 
synthetic lubricants — and the sur- 
gical spares — you’ve kept a lot of 
fellows on the street earning a living 
at a time o’ life when our dads 
would have been laid up for good. 
But those Voion cops, and this one 
world, one government idea: It’s a 



mistake. It’s always been every tribe 
for itself, and a good system, too.” 

“Watch it, Retief,” Big Leon call- 
ed quietly. There was a soft swish of 
tires on clay pavement, the abrupt 
stab of yellowish light beams as 
fast-moving forms closed in on both 
sides. 

“Halt!” a Voion accent came 
from the darkness. “Pull up here, 
you Wumblums, in the name of the 
law!” 

“You small-time chiselers have 
got the gall to pull that routine on 
me?” Voom-Voom trumpeted, accel- 
erating. “Stay out of my way, or I’ll 
leave my tread-marks down your 
backs!” 

“That’s an order, you great bum- 
bling lout!” One of the Voion, ap- 
parently carried away by his own 
recently acquired rank, swung too 
close. Voom-Voom shot out an arm 
like a ship-grapple, gathered the 
luckless creature in, tossed him aside 
to slam the pavement with a clang 
of metallo-organic body plates. A 
second Voion, veering aside, gave a 
shriek, disappeared under the mas- 
sive wheels of Rhum-Rhum. The 
others sheered off, fell back, as the 
Wumblums sped off toward the lights 
now gleaming all across the port 
Retief held onto the worn leather 
hand-straps as the solid wheels ham- 
mered over the pot-holed road. 

“A good thing the CDT hasn’t 
gone as far as handing out power 
guns to those jaspers,” Seymour 
shouted as Rhum-Rhum came up on 
the starboard beam. 

“Look there!” Jerry leaned for- 
ward beside Retief. “There are 
Voion swarming all over the port!”

IF 




“Don’t worry, gents,” Voom- 
Voom hooted. “Rhum-Rhum and me 
will stand by. That was the first 
time I’ve had my wheels on a Voion 
Mnce the "last time I caught one 
prying the lid off my fare-box. It 
felt good.” 

Ill 

T here was a flood-lit gate ahead, 
flanked by a pair of Voion who 
rolled forward officiously — and 
darted back as Voom-Voom barrel- 
ed past them, slammed through the 
fence, hurtled on without slowing. 
They were in among the tall ships 
now, threading their way among 
stacked packing cases, dangling cargo 
nets, hurrying stevedores and Vorch 
cargo-carriers, the latter squat 
Quoppina with three thick func- 
tional wheels and broad, labor- 
scarred carapaces. Ahead Retief saw 
the familiar CDT code stenciled on 
ttte sides of stacked cases being 
unloaded by Voion stevedores from 
the hold of a battered tramp trader 
under a battery of poly arcs. 

“You notice they’re not shipping 
the stuff in Corps vessels,” Big Leon 
pointed out as their mounts pulled 
up at a signal from Retief. “It’s all 
handled pretty cagy; looks like 
there’s angles to this that Longspoon 
doesn’t want publicity on. It just 
happens I know that cargomark.” 
A pair of bustling Voion were at 
work on the cargo net, overseeing 
the placement of the crates. Others 
stood about, as though on guard — 
humbler specimens than the elite po- 
lice, Retief noted; their dull black 
wing-cases lacked the high polish 



and bright-work of their favored 
tribemates. One, wearing the arm- 
band of a Ramp Master, wheeled 
across to confront the visitors. He 
was an oldster, beginning to silver 
around the edges, his thickened wing 
cases showing the marks of repeated 
paring. 

“What d’ye seek here, sirs?” ho 
chirped in tribal Voion, in what was 
meant to be an authorative tone, 
meanwhile working his antenor an- 
tennae in frantic Voion thieves’ code. 

“Shift . cases . conceal . 
special . consignment,” Retief de- 
ciphered. He noted a sudden stir of 
activity among the Voion at the net 
A pair of the patrolling stick-wield- 
ers rolled in to help. The center of 
attention appeared to be a stack of 
cases conspicuously tagged with large 
red cards reading ‘For the Terra® 
Ambassador’. 

“We takee look-see,” Seymour was 
saying in trade pidgin. “We lookec 
gift-gift Terry friend-friend send.” 

“Very go^,” the oldster shifted 
to the same tongue. “Looky see, 
plenty ski pants, snowshoe, smoked 
oyster, bagels, tennis racquet, paint- 
by-number kit. All stuff keep tiny 
Quoppina tot alive all winter.” 

“You hear that, Retief?” Big Leon 
growled. “Some of my hottest trade 
items, those are. You’d think Long- 
spoon was deliberately trying to put 
us traders out of business.” Ho 
pointed suddenly. “Hey, look there!” 
A Voion in tribal dress, with the 
feathery antennae of a Flying Jar- 
wheel strapped to his head, was 
manuevering a pink Timblum — a 
smaller cousin of the mighty Wum- 
blum into position. There was a

squat car hitched behind the mount. 

‘‘That’s Smuk. He’s a retired slav- 
er; used to be one of my best cus- 
tomers. Now look at him, free-load- 
ing! No wonder I don’t see him 
around the warehouse sales any 
more!” 

R etief climbed down from his 
seat, strolled across to study 
the stacked crates. TTie Ramp Mas- 
ter trailed him, his wheels squeaking 
on the dry bearings of old age. Be- 
hind the facade of hurriedly placed 
boxes, Retief counted at least half 
a dozen of the red-marked cases 
identical with the others except for 
the prominent diplomatic address. 
'Fhe Voion twittered nervously at his 
heels. 

“Nice Terry gentleman take look- 
see next side, see plenty nice box, 
you bet,” he croaked. 

“What’s in those, Ramp Master?” 
Retief asked in tribal Voion, indic- 
ating the half-concealed boxes. 

“Eee, the sir speaks good Tribal.” 
The old Voion clacked his palps in 
a gesture indicating Respectful Con- 
gratulation. “Why, as to those cases 
there, they contain educational ma- 
terial, yes, sir, that’s what they con- 
tain. Now, over here . .” 

Big Leon had come up beside 
Retief. “Fed like sticking your nose 
into trouble?” Retief asked softly. 
Leon nodded. “Sure, why not?” 
“Why don’t you go stir up a little 
activity over there, say in about ten 
minutes?” 

“Huh? Oh, I gotcha.” Leon gave 
Retief a quizzical look, went over 
and spoke to Seymour. Beside Retief, 
the old Voion signalled with his 



antennae. A pair of cargo-handlers 
wheeled casually over to hover near 
the Terrans, trailing as they saun- 
tered off, looking over the scene of 
bustling activity. 

Retief moved on along the deep- 
shadowed lane between stacked car- 
go, paused before a heap of crates, 
pointed to the manila envelopes 
stapled to their sides. 

“Mind if I look?” he inquired. 

“As the sir desires,” the oldster 
said quickly. Retief pulled a folded 
copy of a Bill of Lading from the 
pocket, opened it out. It indicated 
that the crate contained bound vol- 
umes of the Pest Control Journal^ 
consigned to the Information Service 
Library in care of the Terran Con- 
sulate at Groon — a small city a 
hundred miles up-river in Deep Jun- 
gle. He went on, casually checking 
packing lists, rounded the end of 
the line of stacked crates, came up 
the back side. Directly behind the 
red-tagged cases, he found a pile of 
boxes contained blank forms destin- 
ed for the Terran Chancery. At that 
moment, an outcry came from be- 
yond the looming bulk of the ship. 
Retief turned to his guide, who was 
now jittering nervously and looking 
in the direction from which the dis- 
turbance emanated. 

“By the way, I forgot to mention 
it, but one of my companions — the 
large one — is something of a practi- 
cal joker. He may have taken it into 
his head to start a fire or plant a 
couple of small choke-bombs. May- 
be you’d better wheel over and check 
on him.” 

“The sir jests?” The Ramp Mas- 
ter looked around for a courier, saw 



18 



IF 




the last of his crew curving sharply 
out of sight on one wheel headed 
for the scene of the growing uproar. 
“If the sir will excuse . 

He shot off at surprising speed. 

A t once Retief turned to the near- 
est of the red-tagged crates, 
used a handy pry-bar to lever a slot 
free. A layer of oil-impregnated 
plastic barred his view of the con- 
tents of the box. He took out a 
compact pocket knife, snapped the 
blade out, slit the liner, reached in, 
felt the lumpy coolness of a plastic- 
coated object. He managed a two- 
fingered grip, drew it out. It was 
a bulky, heavy package, roughly tri- 
angular, larger than Reliefs hand, 
its outlines obscured by the protec- 
tive cocoon. He slit it, peeled it 
back. 

The polished butt of a Mark XXX 
power gun nestled in his hand. 

Retief glanced around; none of the 
port personnel were in view. He 
stripped away the oily covering from 
the gun, dropped the weapon in his 
pocket, then tucked the empty plas- 
tic back inside, folded the liner over 
it, pressed the slat back in position. 

The noises from Big Leon’s direc- 
tion were gaining in timber and vol- 
ume, accompanied by splintering 
sounds. Voom-Voom glanced at Re- 
tief. ‘‘Say, boss, that racket — ” 
“Just ^yish high spirits; it won’t 
last much longer,” Retief said. 
“Meanwhile, see that nobody dis- 
turbs me for the next five minutes.” 
Voom-Voom waved one arm, clicked 
his luminescent organ on and rolled 
forward to cover the approach. Re- 
tief set to work moving the barricade 



of boxes aside and removing red tags 
from the Special Consignment. The 
riot continued, still growing in vol- 
ume. With the tags free, Retief 
moved back to the crates marked 
for Groon, quickly removed the tags, 
used the butt of liis pocket knife to 
hammer labels removed from the 
consignment of forms in place in 
their stead, then hurried on to the 
crated forms, placed the red tags on 
the boxes. 

“Better hurry it up, boss,” Voom- 
Voom hooted softly. “I think the 
excitement’s dying down over there.” 

He broke off to rumble suddenly 
into action. Retief heard the shriU 
of Voion voices. He glanced up at 
the black disc of loop; a glowing 
bulge was showing at one edge now; 
the eclipse would be over in anoth- 
er half-minute. He hurried back to 
the Special Consignment, attached 
the cards from the Library shipment 
intended for Groon. Behind him, 
voices shrilled; Voom-Voom was 
stni blocking the lane, loudly de- 
manding why he should move mere- 
ly to let a pack of Voion riff-raff 
through. Retief stepped quickly iO 
Rhum-Rhum. 

4iTf you backed up carelessly, you 

X might just ram that pile of 
boxes,” he said. “They might get all 
mixed up together . .” 

“They might, at that,” the Wum- 
blum agreed. “Take those scalpers 
half their siesta hour to unscramble 
’em.” He straightened his wheels, 
glanced back, and moved suddenly, 
slamming into the neatly stacked 
crates. They skidded, toppled with a 
crash. Voom-Voom, watching the 



RETIEF'S WAR 



19 




by-play with one pair of eyes, whirl- 
ed about in mock alarm, dumped 
another row. Excited Voion shot 
past him, shrilling, just as the glare 
of returned sunlight sprang across 
the hills, scythed down the slope and 
on across the crowded tarmac to 
bathe the scene of chaos in light. 

Big Leon appeared, looming over 
the scurrying cargo tenders. He 
looked around, frowning. 

“What the Sam Hill happened 
here?” he demanded loudly. 

“Big brute of dumb Wumblum 
makee big mess-mess,” the old 
Voion cargomaster shrieked. “Great 
clumsy louts gotee no damn pidgin 
here!” 

“Don’t spin your wheels, grand- 
pa,” Voom-Voom rumbled care- 
lessly. He leaned over to put his 
armored cranium near Reliefs. 
“How’d I do, chief?” 

“Very effective,” Relief said ap- 
provingly. He walked over to the 
sidelines where a dull-eyed Vorch 
cargo-carrier was squatting, watching 
the activity. 

“There are half a dozen crates 
marked for the Terry Library at 
Groon,” he said in trade dialect to 
the heavyweight. “I wonder if you 
know of an unused shed nearby 
where they might accidentally be 
tucked away out of sight for a few 
days.” He dropped a strip of em- 
bossed plastic trade wampum in the 
Vorch’s nearest hand, which imme- 
diately twitched it out of sight. 

“What’s this — a bribe?” The car- 
rier swiveled his wide head to bring 
his silicon-lensed rear eyes to bear. 

“Just a gratuity for services ren- 
dered,” Relief reassured him. 



“That’s okay then. Just so you 
don’t offer me no graft.” The Vorch 
pointed with a short, thick arm. 
“The little bonded warehouse over 
there — the one with the red carv- 
ing on the front. I’ll stack the stuff 
in there.” 

Retief nodded and rejoined the 
party. 

“Hey, what gives, Retief?” Sey- 
mour demanded. “Leon says — ” 
“Maybe you better not ask too 
many questions,” the big man put in. 
“I think we made our point. Let’s 
settle for that and head back for 
Rum Jungle. Something’s ready to 
pop, and I want to be minding the 
store when it happens.” 

“Maybe you better come with us, 
Retief,” Steel-tooth said. “The post 
is a pretty fair fort if push comes 
to shove.” 

“Don’t talk foolish, Lester.” Leon 
said. “Relief’s got a job to do here.” 
“Yeah,” Steel-tooth said, “but 
when the job blows up in your face, 
remember Rum Jungle. We’ll need 
every man — and then it won’t be 
enough.” 

IV 

A t the Terran Chancery in the 
Path of Many Sporting Agents, 
Retief stepped down from his perch 
and handed a strip of credit to his 
mount. 

“Call on me any time, boss,” the 
Wumblum said. “I kind of like your 
style.” He nodded toward the irreg- 
ularly surfaced Embassy complex, a 
cluster of standard Quopp-style 
buildings perched on the uneven 
ground, painted ochre, Indian red 



20 



IF 




and dusty aquamarine, and perforat- 
ed by irregularly shaped windows at 
random intervals. “First time I ever 
hauled a Terry,” the Wumblum went 
on in a confidential tone. “Between 
you and me, I heard you folks were 
a tight crowd with a credit and not 
much in the sporting line, if you 

know what I mean.” 

“A base canard, Voom-Voom. A 
diplomat considers a day wasted if 
he isn’t playing at least three games 
at once.” 

As Retief stepped through the 

main entry, incongruously alumi- 

num-framed and glass-doored. First 
Secretary Magnan hurried up, a thin, 
harassed figure in the limp yelloW^ 
seersucker shorts and dickey of sub- 
tropical undress kit. 

“Retief,” he called. “Wherever 
have you been? The Ambassador is 
furious. And Colonel Underknuck- 
Ic’s been calling for you for an 
hour! I’ve been frantic!” 

“Why? Can’t they be furious with- 
out me?” 

“The sight of you seems to sti- 
mulate the condition, I grant,” Mag- 
nan said witheringly. “Come along 
now. I’ve told the Colonel you were 
probably out gathering material for 
the quarterly Sewage Report. I trust 
you’ll say nothing to dispel that im- 
pression.” 

“I’ve been cementing relations 
with the Terran business commun- 
ity,” Retief explained as he accom- 
panied the senior diplomat along the 
wide, tiled office-lined corridor which 
had been installed to replace the 
warren of tiny, twisting passages 
and cubicles originally filling the in- 
terior of the structure.

“Hmmm. I’m not sure that was 
wise, in view of the present down- 
playing of Terran private enterprise 
here on Quopp. You know how 
Prime Minister Ikk frowns on that 
sort of thing.” 

“Oh, Prime Minister, eh? Who 
fave him that title?” 

“Why, he advised the Ambassa- 
dor that It was conferred early this 
morning by unanimous vote of the 
Council of Drones.” Retief followed 
Magnan into the lift; the doors clos- 
ed with a soft whoosh! of com- 
pressed air. 

4 4T et’s see,” Retief mused. 

“That’s the dummy legisla- 
ture he set up to satisfy the Am- 
bassador's passion for democracy, 
isn’t it? It was fortunate he had 
seventy-three senile uncles handy to 
appoint; saved the bother of break- 
ing in strangers.” 

“Yours is a distorted view of the 
evolution of representational govern- 
ment here on Quopp,” Magnan said 
reprovingly. “Closer attention to 
your daily Bulletin from the Bird's 
Nest would go far toward homog- 
enizing your thinking on the sub- 
ject.” 

“I thought that was something 
Acy did to milk.” 

“The term refers to voluntary 
alignment of viewpoint toward a 
group-oriented polarity; a sort of 
Knkage of moral horsepower for 
maximal thrust toward the objec- 
tive.” 

“I’m not sure pasteurized thinking 
is rich enough in intellectual vita- 
mins to satisfy my growing curiosity 
about just what Ikk is up to.” 



“It should be apparent even to 
you, Retief,” Magnan said sharply, 
“that the Corps can hardly accredit 
a full Mission to a non-existent plan- 
etary government. Ergo, such a rul- 
ing body must be formed. And who 
better qualified than the Voion to 
undertake the task?” 

“You might have something there. 
Their past history has given them 
a firm grounding in the basics of 
politics; but with the other tribes 
outnumbering them a hundred to 
one, it’s a little hard to see how 
they’re planning to impose planet- 
wide enlightenment on a race that’s as 
fond of anarchy as the Quoppina.” 
“That, my dear Retief, is Ambas- 
sador Longspoon’s problem, not oun. 
It was his idea to groom the Voion 
for leadership; our task is merely 
to implement his policies.” 

“And if in the process we saddle 
the other ninety-nine per cent of 
the population with a dictatorship, 
that’s a mere detail.” 

“Ah, I can see you’re beginning 
to get the picture.” The elevator 
halted and Magnan led the way out, 
paused at the heavy door barring 
the public from the Chancery wing. 
“I hope you’ll restrain your unfor- 
tunate tendency to essay japes at the 
expense of decorum, Retief. Colonel 
Underknuckle is in no mood for 
facetiae.” He pushed through, nod- 
ded mechanically at the small, gray 
Voion female buffing her chelae at 
a small desk of polished blue wood 
at one side of the red-carpeted cor- 
ridor. She clacked her palps indiffer- 
ently, blew a large bubble of green 
spearmint and popped it with lively 
report.

"Impertinence I” Magnan sniffed 
under his breath. “A few months 
ago the baggage was an apprentice 
•lop-drudge in a local inn of most 
unsavory repute. Now, after we’ve 
trained her and given her that ex- 
pensive set of chrome inlays, a de- 
risive pop of the gum is considered 
adequate greeting for her benefac- 
tors.” 

“That’s the trouble with uplifting 
the masses. They get to believing it 
themselves.” 

M agnan stopped at an austere 
slab door marked Military Au 
tache, fitted an expression on his 
narrow features appropriate for 
greeting a Grade Seven employee, 
pushed through into deep carpeted 
silence. 

“Ah, there, Hernia. I believe Col- 
onel Underknuckle wished to see 
Mr. Retief.” 

The fat woman behind the desk 
patted a coil of mummified hair 
with a hand like a glove' full of 
lard, showed Magnan a simper suit- 
able for a First Secretary and thumb- 
ed a button on a console before her. 
A chime sounded beyond the half- 
open door. 

“Yes, confound it! What is it this 
time!” a voice like splitting canvas 
snarled from the desk speaker. 
“What in the name of perdition’s 
become of Magnan? If he’s not here 
in five minutes, send along that 
memo to the Ambassador I keep 
handy — ” 

“It is I,” Magnan said stiffly. 
“Don’t use grammar on me, Mag- 
nan!” the Attache shouted. “Come 
in here at once! There’s been an- 



other communication from the be- 
nighted vessel. The saucy minx at 
the controls insists she’s bringing her 
in, clearance or no clearance. And 
where the devil’s that fellow, Re- 
tief?” 

“I have him right here. Colonel.” 
As his callers entered the room. 
Underknuckle, a lean, high-shoul- 
dered man with bushy white hair, 
hollow, purplish cheeks and a lumpy, 
clay-colored nose, his immaculately 
tailored mid-afternoon semi-formal 
uniform awry, spun in his hip-u- 
matic contour chair, causing the 
power-swivel mechanism to whine in 
protest. He glared at Retief. 

“So there you are at last! What’s 
the meaning of this, sir? Is it pos- 
sible that you’re unaware of the new 
restrictions on tourism here on 
Quopp?” The colonel lowered his 
voice. “Schemes are all about us, 
gentlemen! We’ll have to look sharp 
to our fences to keep our powder 
dry!” 

“But just one little shipload of 
ladies — and in difficulty at that — ” 
Magnan began. 

“Orders are orders!” Underknuck- 
le hit the desk with his fist, winced, 
slung his fingers as though drying 
them. 

“Let me assure you, when Am- 
bassador Longspoon imposed entry 
quotas on sightseers, there was an 
excellent reason for it!” He barked 
through a grimace of pain. 

“Gracious, yes. Colonel,” Magnan 
chirped. “We all know Prime Min- 
ister Ikk doesn’t like Terries.” 

“Ikk’s likes and dislikes have 
nothing to do with it. It was the 
Ambassador’s decision!”

**01 course, Colonel. What I 
meant was, you don’t like Terries.” 
**Don’t like Terrans? Why I’m a 
Tcrran myself, you idiotl” 

**I didn’t mean to give the wrong 
impression, I’m sure, Fred,” Magnan 
said breathlessly. **Personally, I love 
Terries — ” 

**Not these Terries!” Underknuck- 
le snatched up a paper and waved 
it. **A boatload of females! Giddy, 
irresponsible women! Idlers — or 
worse! Parasites! And no visas, mind 
you! And the ring-leader, Mr. Re- 
lief — ” the colonel thrust a mobile 
lower lip at him — “is demanding to 
speak to you, sir! By name!” 

**Retief!” Magnan turned on him. 
“What can you be thinking of, im- 
porting luxury goods!” 

<4Tt’s clear enough what he’s think- 
JL ing of,” Underknuckle snap- 
ped. **And I hardly need point out 
that such thoughts are not in con- 
sonance with tight military security!” 
Magnan assumed a troubled-but- 
determined expression. **Did the 
young lady give a name?” 

**Harrumph! Indeed she did. Tell 
him it’s Fifi,’ she said — as though 
Ihe Military Attache were a common 
messenger-boy!” 

**Heavens — such cheek!” Magnan 
sniffed. 

**The name itself conjures up im- 
ages of. rhinestone-clad doxies,” Un- 
derknuckle snorted. **I confess it’s 
difficult to understand how a diplo- 
mat has occasion to make the ac- 
quaintance of persons of such 
stripe!” 

**0h. I’m sure Mr. Retief can 
fix you up, Fred,” Magnan volun- 



teered. “He seemed to have a 
knack.” 

“1 do not wish to be fixed up!” 
Underknuckle roared. “1 wish to 
make it clear to these junketing trol- 
lops that they will not be permitted 
to make planetfall here! Now, if 
you, Mr. Retief, will be so kind as 
to report to the ^Message Center and 
so inform your, ah petiie amie — ” 

‘*1 don’t have an amie at the mo- 
ment, Colonel, petite or otherwise,” 
Retief said. “And, as it happens, I 
don’t know any young ladies named 
Fifi. Still, it’s never too late to recti- 
fy the omission. I’ll be happy to 
talk to her.” 

“I’m gratified to hear it,” Under- 
knuckle said coldly. “And if that 
vessel lands on this planet, young 
man. Til hold you solely respons- 
ible!”

B ack in the corridor, Magnan trot- 
ted af Retief’s side, offering ad- 
vice. “Now, just tell this young 
person, kindly but firmly, that your 
time is fully occupied by your duties 
and that if she’ll just flit along to 
Adobe, say — there’s a fascinating 
museum there with a lovely display 
of mummified giant wheel-spiders.” 
*‘I won’t presume to plan any it- 
ineraries,” Retief interrupted gently. 
**I think it might be better to find 
out what the girls are up to first.” 
“Yes, it does seem odd they’d 
plan a vacation on Quopp. After all, 
there’s nothing here but jungle, with 
a few thousand tribal villages and 
three or four dozen market towns.” 
They turned in at the Message

Center, showed badges; electro-locks 
clicked and the inner door slid back, 
revealing a bright-lit room crammed 
with lock-files and coding machines. 

“Oh, boy, am I glad to see you, 
Mr. Retief,” a freckled youth with 
thick contact lenses and a struggling 
mustache blurted, coming forward. 
“That babe aboard the yacht’s a 
dish, all right, but she’s got a way 
of flashing her eyes at a fellow 
when she doesn’t get her way — ” 
“If you don’t mind, Willis, Mr. 
Retief and 1 are in something of a 
hurry,” Magnan cut him off. 
“Which screen are they on? 

“The yacht’s over the horizon at 
the moment,” the boy said. “She’ll 
make re-entry on the next pass; a 
couple more minutes, I guess.” 
“What’s a yacht doing out here, 
Willy?” Retief asked. “Quopp’s a 
long way off the regular tourist 
runs.” 

“Beats me, Mr. Retief. She’s a 
nice job. Ten thousand tons, loaded 
with all the latest comm gear. Too 
bad all we have is this obsolete line- 
of-sight stuff.” He gestured at the 
banked equipment panels. “Tough 
about those girls losing their cel- 
estial tracking circuit, too. Even if 
they could get in here, they’d be 
stuck for months waiting for a re- 
placement. That Mark XXXIV stuff 
is hard to come by.” 

“Emergency let-down, eh? What 
kind of help are we giving them?” 
The youth shrugged. “None. Long- 
spoon’s orders. Says they’ve got no 
business coming in on Quopp.” 

“Did you tell him about the track- 
erf' 

“He said they could go on to 



the next system on manual track- 
mg. 

“Two months of staring into a 
tracker could get tiring,” Retief said. 
“And a good chance of fatigue error 
and no planetfall at the end of it 
Let’s get ’em down.” 

“Yeah, but the Ambassador’s or- 
ders — ” 

“I’ll take the responsibility of 
countermanding them. Get the yacht 
on the SDR and start feeding her 
data as soon as she makes contact.” 

C4T ook here, Retief,” Magnan 
i ^ held up an admonitory hand. 
“I can’t stand idly by while you 
exceed your authority! I confess it 
seems a trifle surprising die Ambas- 
sador hasn’t authorized aid to a dis- 
tressed Terr an vessel, but — ” 

“We don’t need authorization in a 
Deep Space emergency. Check Title 
Nine, Article Twelve, Section three- 
B of the Uniform Code.” 

“Hey, that’s right,” Willis blinked. 
“The Code overrides any Planetary 
Authority, it says so right in — ” 

“See here, Retief.” Magnan mov- 
ed to Retiefs side, speaking low. 
“Quoting technicalities is all very 
well, but afterward one still has the 
problem of an overridden Ambassa- 
dor to deal with. Hardly a shrewd 
move, career- wise.” 

“We’ll get the ladies down first, 
and carry out career salvage after- 
wards,” Retief said soothingly. 
“Maybe it would be better if you 
went down to spot-check the com- 
missary while I attend to this.” 
Magnan frowned, settled his dick- 
ey in place. “Never mind,” he said 
shortly. “I’ll stand by.”

A blare of static burst from the 
center screen on the console across 
the room, followed by rapidly flick- 
ering bars of light. Then the image 
steadied into focus. A girPs face ap- 
peared, framed in red-blonde hair, a 
headset clamped in place. Other 
feminine faces were visible behind 
her, all young, all worried. 

“Hello, Quopp Control,” she said 
calmly. “It looks as though the rock 
that hulled us did more than take 
out the tracker. I have no horizontal 
gyros, and damned little control in 
my left corrector banks. I’m going 
to have to do this by the seat-of-the- 
pants method. I’d appreciate it if 
you’d loosen up and feed me some 
trajectory data.” 

Relief flipped the SEND key. 
“Quopp Control here, young lady. 
Listen closely; there won’t be time 
for a repeat. You have two choices 
on impact areas; one is the com- 
mercial port here at Ixix. If you’ve 
got a fix on me, you know the 
general location. I’m throwing the 
R and D fixer beam on the line now; 
lock onto it if you can.” 

The girl frowned. “Sorry, Quopp 
Control. No response from my R 
and D. I have a fix on your trans- 
mission, though, and — ” 

“Your other possibility is an un- 
improved patch of rocky desert 
about fifty miles north-north-west. 
Try to . align on my signal here. If 
you miss, you’ll have the other as 
a backup.” 

“Roger, Quopp Tower. I’ve got 
tome speed to kill if I want to make 
you on this pass.” 

“This pass is it,” Relief snapped 
out “I’m clocking you on a descend- 



ing spiral with an intersect this or- 
bit. Damp that velocity fast!” 

T he image on the screen jittered, 
jumped; Relief waited while rhe 
girl worked the controls, watching 
the glowing red blip moving rapidly 
across the R and D screen, dropping 
steadily closer to the line represent- 
ing the horizon. 

“More grief,” the. girl said brisk- 
ly. “I’ve got about half power on 
the forward main tubes. I’m afraid 
I’m going to have to give your bea- 
con a miss and try for the desert.” 
“Throw everything you’ve got to 
your retros, let ’em blast and keep 
blasting! You’re going to overshoot 
by a hundred miles on your present 
course, and there’s nothing out there 
but nineteen thousand miles of un- 
explored jungle!” 

There was a long moment of tense 
silence as the girl’s hands moved 
out of sight. Then she shook her 
head, gave a quick, flashing smile. 
“That’s it, Quopp Control. A fizzle. 
Did you say nineteen thousand 
miles?” 

“As the Phip flies. How many are 
there aboard?” 

“Ten of us.” 

“I’ve got a tracker on you; try 
to nurse her in as easy as you can. 
Got any flares aboard?” 

“Tf not, there are a few cases of 
hundred and sixty proof Imperial 
Lily Gin; I’m sure the intended re- 
cipient won’t mind if I light them 
off.” Already her voice was growing 
fuzzy as the hurtling ship neared 
the horizon. 

“Hold her steady on your present 
course. Looks like you’ll intersect

ground zero about eighty miles out.” 
“I’m not reading you, Quopp. I 
hope you get here before all the 

gin s — 

Her voice broke off. Then it came 
again, faint and far away: ‘'Quopp 
. er, a . ing in . make it 
. The voice was gone in a rising 
hiss of random noise. 

“Good Lord, 1 hope the poor girls 
land safely,” Magnan gasped. He 
dabbed at his forehead with a large 
floral-patterned tissue. “Imagine be- 
ing down in that horrible wilderness, 
swarming with unpacified Quopp- 
kal” 

“ril get an Embassy heli on the 
way to make the pick-up,” Retief 
said; he glanced at the wall clock. 
“No time to waste if weTe going to 
collect them by dark.” 

“Retief — are you sure you don’t 
know this Fifi person?” Magnan 
queried as they turned to the door. 

“Regrettably, no. But I hope to 
correct the omission soon.” 

The interoffice communicator 
screen burped; an angular female 
face with stiff-looking hair and a 
porridgy complexion blinked into fo- 
cus. 

“There you are,” she snapped at 
Retief. “The Ambassador wants to 
see you in his office — right away!” 
“Tsk,” Magnan said. “I warned 
you about stretching those coffee 
breaks.” 

“Hi, Fester,” Retief greeted the 
woman. “Is it business, or should I 
bring my tennis racquet?” 

“You can save the wisecracks,” 
she sniffed. “There are two Plane- 
tary Police officers with him.” 
“Goodness, I’d be glad to give 



His Excellency a character refer- 
ence,” Magnan burbled. “What did 
they catch — that is, what’s the 
charge?” 

‘Tt’s not Ambassador Longspoon 
who’s in trouble,” Fester said coldly. 
“It’s Mr. Retief they want to sec.” 

VI 

A mbassador Longspoon was a 
small man with bright, close-set 
eyes in a parchment-yellow face, a 
mouth which would have been in- 
conspicuous on a carp, and a shiny 
skull over which a few strands of 
damp-looking hair were combed for 
maximum coverage. He sat behind 
a nine-foot Ambassadorial desk of 
polished platinum, flanked by two 
Voion, one ornately crested and 
jeweled, whose oculars followed Re- 
tief unwaveringly as he entered the 
room. 

“Commissioner Ziz, Mr. Retief,” 
Longspoon said in a voice like a 
dry bearing. There was silence as he 
looked expectantly from one of the 
Voion to the other. 

“Well, how about it, Xif,” the 
Commissioner buzzed in harsh Tri- 
bal Voion to his companion. “Is this 
the one?” 

“That’s him, chief,” the other 
cop confirmed. “He was the ring- 
leader.” 

“Here, Commissioner, I must ask 
you to speak Terranl” Longspoon 
rasped. 

“Just advising my associate that 
he mustn’t harbor grudges for the 
brutal treatment he received,” Ziz 
said smoothly. “I assured him your 
Excellency will make full amends.”

“Amends. Yes.” Longspoon favor- 
ed Relief with a look like a jab from 
an old maid’s umbrella. “It appears 
there’s been some sort of free-for-all 
in an unsavory local drinking-spot.” 
He put his bony fingers on the 
desk-top and pinched them together. 
“I trust you have some explana- 
tion?” 

“Explanation of what, Mr. Am- 
bassador?” Retief inquired pleasant- 

ly- 

“Of just what would possess an 
Embassy Officer to attack members 
of the Planetary Police in the per- 
formance of their duties!” Purplish 
color was creeping up from under 
Longspoon’s stiff mid-morning in- 
formal collar. 

Retief shook his head sympatheti- 
cally. “No, I certainly couldn’t ex- 
plain a thing like that.” 

Longspoon’s jaw dropped. “Sure- 
ly you have some, ah, justification 
to offer?” He shot a quick side- 
glance at the Voion. 

“It would be pretty hard to justi- 
fy attacking a policeman,” Retief 
offered. “In the performance of his 
duties at that.” 

“Look here!” Longspoon leaned 
toward Retief. “You’re supposed to 
be a diplomat!” he hissed from the 
corner of his mouth. “You might at 
least try lying. a little!” 

Retief nodded agreeably. “What 
about?”. 

“Confound it, sir!” Longspoon 
waved a hand. “When a Police 
Commissioner rolls into my office 
and charges one of my staff with 
aggravated breach of the peace, you 
can hardly expect me to simply ig- 
nore the situation!” 



“Certainly not,” Retief said firmly, 
“Still, I think if you explain to him 
that invading the Terrestrial Em- 
bassy to make unsupported charges 
is impolite, and warn him never to 
try it again, it won’t be necessary 
to demand his resignation.” 

“His resignation!” Longspoon’i 
mouth was open again. “Hmmm.” 
He swivelled to face the Commis- 
sioner. “Perhaps I should point out 
that invading the Terrestrial Embas- 
sy to make unsup — ” 

“One moment!” Ziz cut in harsh- 
ly. “The question here is one of 
appropriate punishment to lawless 
foreigners who engage in the murder 
of harmless, grub-loving Voion! I 
demand that the culprit be turned 
over to me for a fair Trial by 
Internal Omens!” 

4 4 A s I recall, the metnoa requires 
a surgical operation to study 
the evidence,” Longspoon mused, 
“What happens if the victim — ex; 
I mean patient — is innocent?” 
“Then we weld him back up and 
give him a touching funeral cere- 
mony.” 

“No, Ziz,” Longspoon wagged a 
finger playfully. “If we simply turn- 
ed our diplomats over to anyone 
who wanted them, we’d be stripped 
of personnel in no time.” 

“Just the one,” Ziz suggested deli- 
cately. 

“I’d like to oblige, my dear Com- 
missioner, but the precedent would 
be most unfortunate.” 

The desk screen chimed. 

“Yes, Fester?” Longspoon eyed it 
impatiently. “I told you I wasn’t to 
be disturbed.”

IF 





“It’s His Omnivoracity/' Fester 
squeaked excitedly. “He presents his 
second best compliments and insists 
on speaking to you at once, Mr. 
Ambassador!” 

Longspoon twitched a bleak smile 
at the Police Commissioner. “Well, 
my good friend Ikk seems to be a 
bit outside himself today. Just tell 
him I’ll ring him up later, Fester.” 
“He says it’s about an educational 
shipment,” the female cut in. “Heav- 
ens, what language!” 

“Ah, yes, educational material,” 
Longspoon said. “Well, I’m always 
most concerned about educational 
affairs; perhaps I’d best just see 
what he has in mind.” He turned the 
volume down low, listened as a tiny 
voice chirped angrily. 

* “Are you sure?” he muttered. “Six 
cases?” 



There was more shrill talk from 
the communicator. 

“Nonsense!” Longspoon snapped. 
“What possible motive — ” 

Ikk buzzed again. Longspooa 
glanced at Retief with a startled ex- 
pression. “No,” he said. “Quite out 
of the question. See here. I’ll call 
you back. I have, er, callers at the 
moment.” He rang off. The Police 
Commissioner relaxed the auditory 
members which had been straining 
forward during the exchange. 

“You still refuse to remand this 
one to my custody?” He pointed at 
Retief. 

“Have you all gone mad?” Long- 
spoon barked. “I’ll deal with Mr. 
Retief in my own way!” 

“In that case — ” Ziz turned to 
his retainer. “Put phase two into 
operation,” he snapped in Tribal.

ust sending the lad along to water 
iie jelly flowers down at headquar- 
ters,” he added soothingly as Long- 
spoon drew breath to protest. Xif 
wheeled across to the door and left 
silently. Ziz rolled to the lopsidedly 
hexagonal window, glanced out into 
the street. 

“A pity your Excellency didn’t see 
fit to assist the police in the mainte- 
nance of law and order,” he said, 
turning to Longspoon. “However, I 
shall take the disappointment phil- 
osophically.” 

He broke off, waving both poster- 
ior antennae. “Hark!” he said. “Do 
I scent a suspicious odor?” 

Longspoon cleared his throat hur- 
riedly. “My throat balm,” he said. 
“My physician insists . .” He sniff- 
ed again. “Smoke!” 

He jumped to his feet. At that 
moment, a shrill bell jangled into 
strident life somewhere beyond the 
door. 

iiT^lee for your lives!” Ziz keen- 
-T ed. He shot to the door, 
flung it wide. A billow of black 
smoke bulged into the room. 

Longspoon dithered for a mo- 
ment, then grabbed up a code book 
and the Classified Despatch reel, 
tossed them into a desk-side safe, 
dammed it shut just as a pair of 
Voion charged into the room, haul- 
ing a heavy fire house with a mas- 
sive brass nozzle from which a weak 
stream of muddy water dribbled into 
the deep-pile carpeting. Ziz barked 
a command and pointed at Retief. 
The firemen dropped the hose — 
and were bowled aside as Ambassa- 
dor Longspoon hurtled between 



them, his basketball-size paunch 
jouncing under his overlapping vests. 
Ziz spun, reached for Retief with a 
pair of horny grasping members: 
the Terran leaned asi,de, caught one 
of the Voion’s arms and jerked. Ziz 
went over with a crash. 

Retief whirled to the window from 
which the Commissioner had glanc- 
ed a moment before, saw a crowd 
of crested and ornamented Voion 
police pressing toward the Embassy. 

“Fast action,” he murmured. He 
stepped past the overturned firemen 
into the corridor; wide-eyed staff 
members were appearing from doors, 
batting at smoke-clouds. Shouts and 
squeals sounded. Retief pushed 
through toward an open door from 
which dense yellowish clouds were 
pouring, layering out at chest height. 
He reached the far wall of the room, 
groped for and found an overturned 
typist’s chair, slammed it at the dim 
glow of a small triangular window. 

The colored glass fell outward with 
a musical twinkle. At once the 
smoke — boiling from an overturned 
waste-basket, Retief saw — - was 
swept toward the opening by a strong 
draft. He picked up the smoking 
waste-basket and contents, stepped 
into the lavatory and doused it with 
water. It died with a prolonged hiss. 
Retief lifted a small, soot-blackened 
plastic cannister from the basket. A 
small wisp of smoke was still coil- 
ing from it. Incised on its base wer« 
what appeared to be Groaci hiero- 
glyphs.

“Relief! The service door's jam- 
med with people! We’re irapped!’" 
“Let’s try another route. Relief 
started toward the front of the 
building, Magnan trailing. 

“But what about the others 1” 

“I predict the tire scare will give 
them excellent appetites for dinner.” 
“Scare?” 

“It seems to be just smoke bombs.” 
“You mean — Relief I You didn’t!” 
“No, but somebody did.” They 
reached the wide hall before the 
main Embassy entrance door, packed 
now with excited diplomats, semi- 
hysterical stenographers milling in 
the smoke and swarms of Voion 
firemen, wheeling authoritatively 
through the press, shrilling the alarm. 
More Voion were struggling in the 
door to breast the tide of escape- 
bent Terrans. 

“All personnel must evacuate the 
premises at once,” a cop with a 
bright red inlay across his ventral 
plates keened. “Collapse is immin- 
ent! The danger is frightful! Remem- 
ber, you are all highly combustible!” 
“I don’t know what the game is, 
but we’d better have a fast look 
around.” Relief headed for a side 
corridor. A stout diplomat with four 
boneless chins flapped a hand at 
him. 

“I say, young man! All these lo- 
cals invading the Terrestrial Em- 
bassy — it’s irregular! Now, I want 
you to speak to Chief Sskt, and 
point out — ” 

“Sorry, Counsellor Eggwalk; rush 
job.” Relief pushed past, forced his 
way through a shouting knot of en- 
tangled police and Terrans, rounded 
a curve in the corridor. A small door 



marked Maintenance Personnel Only 
caught his eye. It stood ajar. The 
lock. Relief noted, was broken. 

“Mr. Magnan. If you see any vol- 
unteer firemen headed this way, gilPe 
me a fast yell.” 

“Relief! What are you — ” 
Magnan’s voice cut off as Retiaf 
slid through the door, went down a 
narrow ramp into the cool- of a loia- 
ceilinged cellar. There was a scuny 
of sound ahead; he ducked undir 
insulated air ducts, saw a fliclur 
of motion down a shadowy passage^ 
heard the scrape of wheels scuffling 
on uneven pavement. 

“Come on out,” he called. “Nodi- 
ing back there but a couple of sum|i 
pumps and some bflge water.” 

The sounds had ceased now. Re- 
lief took a step — and a three-foot 
yellow-green Quoppina of the Dink 
tribe shot out of the darkness duck- 
ed under his arm, veered around 
the looming bulk of the furnace, 
disappeared into the dark mouth of 
a narrow crawlway. Relief paused, 
listening. There was a soft buzzing 
from far back in the recess where 
the Dink had hidden. He ducked his 
head, moved toward the source of 
the sound. Above, the thudding of 
feet and the shouts of Terr an and 
Voion were faint, remote. Some- 
where, water dripped. 

R elief followed the sound, traced 
it to a dark crevice behind the 
metal-clad housing of an air-process- 
ing unit. He reached in, brought out 
a foot-long ovoid, plastic-surfaced. 
It hummed busily. He could feel the 
tiny vibration against his hands, fie 
spun, headed for the ramp. 



RETIEF'S WAR 



31 




Back in the hall, Magnan was 
Bowhere in sight. Ten feet away, a 
Voion cop stood on relaxed, out- 
ward-slanting wheels, talking into a 
•mall field microphone. He broke off 
when he saw Relief, jerked two arms 
in a commanding gesture. 

“Out! Fire has reached boilers!” 
he rasped in badly accented trade 
dialect. 

Retief balanced the humming ob- 
ject on one outstretched hand. “You 
know what this is?” he inquired 
casually. 

“No time for ball games,” the 
Voion shrilled. “Fool Terry — ” 

He stopped, snapped his anterior 
tyes forward, made a whistling noise 
between his palps, then spun, dug 
off with a squeak of new Terry-is- 
sue neoprene. Retief turned toward 
a side exit. Two Voion appeared 
ahead, skidded to a halt at sight of 
him. 

“That’s him!” one shrilled. “Get 
him, boys!” More Voion shot into 
view, closing in. “Don’t move, stilt- 
cr!” the cop commanded. “What’s 
that you’re holding?” 

“This?” Retief juggled the ovoid. 
•*Oh, this is just an old Plooch egg. 
I was just cleaning out my collec- 
tion, and — ” 

“You lie, unwheeled crippling!” 
The cops crowded in, reaching. “I’ll 
wager a liter of Hell-rose it’s part 
of the loot!” one keened. “It’ll mean 
promotions all around when we 
bring this in!” 

“Give me that, you!” eager Voion 
manipulative members grabbed for 
the buzzing object. “We’ll take it 
out the back way!” 

“Sure, you have it, fellows,” Retief 



offered genially. “Just hurry back 
to your boss with it.” 

“Bribes will do you no good, Ter- 
ran,” a cop shrilled as the find wa§ 
passed from one gleeful fireman to 
another. “His Omnivoracity wants to 
see you — in person.” He jabbed 
with his club at Retief, who caught 
the heavy weapon, jerked it from its 
owner’s grip, slammed it across his 
wrist with a metallic clang. More 
clubs flashed; Retief fended off 
blows, then charged, slamming Voion 
in all directions. 

A club whistled past his ear; a 
harsh voice shrilled “Stop him!” 
Ahead, a dim blue light glowed over 
a side door. 

Retief skidded to a halt, tried it: 
locked. He stepped back kicked at 
the lock. The door burst wide. 

Retief plunged through into a nar- 
row street — and stopped dead, fac- 
ing a solid rank of Voion who ring- 
ed him in with leveled spears with 
flaring barbed heads. 

“Welcome to our midst,” a police 
lieutenant with an enamelled badge 
hissed. “You will now accompany us 
without resistance, or you will die, 
unseen by your fellows.” 

ii A h-ah,” Retief chided. “Ikk will 
be annoyed if you do any- 
thing rash.” 

“An excellent point,” the cop 
agreed. “I suppose after all we shall 
have to satisfy ourselves with merely 
poking holes in you here and there. 
The effect will be the same.” 

“Your logic is inescapable,” Re- 
tief conceded. “I’ll be delighted to 
call on His Omnivoracity.” 

There was a sharp tremor under- 

IF 




foot, followed instantly by a dull 
Boom! A shower of plaster dust fell 
from the open door at Retief s back. 
Glass tinkled from nearby windows. 
Shrill Voion sounds broke out, ques- 
tioning. Retief turned, surveyed the 
wall of the Embassy tower. A large 
crack had appeared some yards to 
the right of the door. 

“I guess it wasn’t a Plooch egg 
after all,” he said judiciously. 

The spearheads had jumped a foot 
closer at the explosion. “Watch 
him!” the lieutenant barked. 

“Steady boys,” Retief cautioned. 
“Don’t louse up an important pinch 
with any hasty moves.” 

“Button your mandibles,” the cop 
rasped. “Youll have your chance 
to work them soon enough!” He 
motioned and an avenue opened 
through the warriors. Retief moved 
off, spear-points at his back. 

VH 

P rime Minister Ikk was a larger 
than average Voion with a six- 
teen-coat lacquer job, jeweled palps, 
and an elaborately crested headpiece 
featuring metallic turquoise curli- 
ques and white Rhoon plumes. 

He lounged at ease in his office, 
a wide, garishly decorated room 
the floor of which, Retief noted, was 
scattered with blank CDT forms. 
The Voion’s main wheels were brac- 
ed in padded, satin-lined frames. A 
peculiarly vile-smelling dope-stick of 
Groaci manufacture was clamped in 
one manipulative member. He waved 
the latter at the guards standing by, 
dribbling ashes carelessly on the rug. 
“Leave us,” he snapped in Tribal. 



“And no spying, either!” The cops 
filed out silently. Ikk waited untfl 
the door closed, then swiveled lo 
stare at Retief. 

“So you are the person.” He cant- 
ed both sets of antennae forward 
alertly. “It seems we bad a busy 
morning, eh?” His voice had ah 
edge like torn metal. 

“Rather dull, actually,”’ Retief 
said easily. “Sightseeing, you know.” 
“And what sort of sights did you 
see?” 

“Some rather interesting exam- 
ples of Navajo beadwork and a nice 
display of hand-painted Groaci back- 
scratchers. Then there was — ” 
“Save your flippancy, TerranI” 
Ikk snapped. “Your activities are 
known! It remains merely to fill in 
certain, ah, details!” 

“Perhaps you’d care to be a little 
more specific,” Retief suggested. 
“After all, nobody’s listening.” 
“You were seen at the port,” Ikk 
grated. “You created a disturbance, 
after which certain items were found 
to be missing.” 

“Oh? What items?” 

“Six large cases, newly arrived 
aboard a chartered freight vessel.” 
Ikk snapped. “They contained edu- 
cational material destined to play an 
important role in my program few 
the uplift of the downtrodden Quop- 
pina masses.” 

“I see. You think I may have 
picked them up and strolled off 
without noticing.” 

“An end to your insolence!” Ikk 
snarled. “What have you done with 
the purloined consignment?” 

Retief shook his head. “I haven’t 
seen your schoolbooks.”

*^BahI enough of this verbal pus- 
; igr-lootingl You know what the 
Macs contain as well as 1 — ” 

*‘1 believe you mentioned educa- 
tional material — ** 

**What could be more educational 
Ilian guns?” Ikk screeched. *^The 
truth, now!” 

44‘'"T^e truth is, you’re making a 
A blunder, Ikk. Your fellow 
Quoppina aren’t as ready for com- 
pulsory education as you — ” 

*^If they’ve grown wise at my ex- 
pense — trough your meddling/* 
Ikk cut in, **1 promise you an en- 
lightening experience under the im- 
plements of a staff of experienced 
speech tutors!” 

”I’m sure your training aids are 
tucked safely away out of circula- 
tkm,” Retief said soothingly. “That 
being the case, I suggest you re- 
i^praise the whole indoctrination 
program and try a less ambitious ap- 
proach.” 

“Ah, 1 see it now!” Ikk shrilled. 
“Longspoon thinks to unseat me, re- 
place me with some compliant pup- 
pet! A Horrp, perhaps, or one of 
those wishy-washy Yorkle! Well, it 
won’t work!” He lowered his voice 
suddenly. “See here, my good fel- 
low, I’m sure we could work out 
something. Just tell me where you’ve 
hidden the guns and I’ll see to it 
you’re appropriately rewarded after 
flic enlightenment.” 

“That’s a fascinating proposal, 
Mr. Prime Minister. But I’m afraid 
Fd lie awake nights wondering what 
yon considered appropriate. No, on 
the whole I think I’d prefer to take 
my chances on my own.” 



“An opportunity you are hardly 
likely to enjoy,” Ikk grated, “con- 
sidering the fact that I have fifty 
thousand crack troops in the city 
at this moment, all of them between 
you and your friends. As soon as 
you’ve mentioned the location of the 
arras. I’ll sec that you’re returned 
safe and sound. And I’ll personally 
make mention to Ambassador Long- 
spoon of your outstanding contribu- 
tions to Terran-Voion relationships.” 
“Fifty thousand troops, you say,” 
Retief countered. “That’s not a big 
enough army for a first class victory 
parade, to say nothing of taking over 
a planet with a population of five 
billion argumentative Quoppina.” 
“The fifty thousand I mentioned 
are merely my household detach- 
ment,” Ikk purred. “Every Voion on 
Quopp answers to me — two million 
of them! They’ve been training for 
a year at secret camps in the Deep 
Jungle. They are now ready!” 
“Except for the guns,” Retief 
said. “Still, there were only a few 
hundred of them. They wouldn’t 
have helped you much.” 

“Today’s shipment was but the 
first of many! But enough of this 
gossip! For the last time: Give up 
your secret and enjoy my lasting 
favor!” 

“You mean if I tell you, you’ll 
give me an escort back to the Em- 
bassy, no hard feelings?” 

“Certainly, my dear chap! I’ll even 
concoct a stirring tale of your ab- 
duction by unscrupulous elements 
from whom I effected your rescue, 
not neglecting to mention your own 
brisk resistance to their wiles.” 
“Brisker than you anticipated. 



34 



IF 




perhaps,” Relief said. “I think I’ve 
learned enough to satisfy my curi- 
osity. So — if you’ll just move away 
from that desk and back up against 
the wall—” 

I kk erected his oculars violently. 

“Eh?” He broke off, looking at 
the gleaming new power gun in Re- 
lief’s hand. 

“What’s this?” he squeaked. “I’ve 
offered you safe conduct!” 

“Now, Ikk, you don’t really think 
I’d expect a campaigner of your 
experience to let me off scot-free, do 
you?” 

“Well, my fellows might have to 
employ a few little measures on 
you, just to be sure you weren’t 
holding anything back. But then I’ll 
have them patch you up nicely after- 
ward.” 

“Sorry. I have a strong intuitive 
feeling that your Torture Depart- 
ment may not realize just how fra- 
gile human hide is.” 

“I shall know in a moment.” The 
Prime Minister started toward Re- 
lief — six feet of armored hostility, 
four arms like sheet-metal clubs tip- 
ped with bolt-cutters cocked for ac- 
tion. 

“I can see that Your Omnivorac- 
ity hasn’t yet sampled Terran edu- 
cational methods personally,” Relief 
commented. “Another foot and I’ll 
give you yoUr first lesson.” 

Ikk halted. “Would you dare?” he 
keened. 

“Sure. Why not? Now, don’t make 
any sudden moves. I’m going to tie 
you up. Then I’m leaving.” 

Ikk hissed but submitted as Relief 
plucked the ministerial flag from its 



place, thrust the staff through his 
spokes and bound it in place, then 
tied all four arms firmly. 

“There, now, you’ll be all right 
until the sweepers arrive along about 
dinner time.” 

“You’re a fool!” Ikk shrilled. 
“You’ll never get clear.** 

“Perhaps not,” Relief said. “In 
that case, education may never come 
to Quopp.” He went to the intercom. 
“When I flip the key, tell them I’m 
coming out,” he said. “Tell them to 
trail me at a respectful distance, 
because I’m suspicious. Also, you’re 
not to be disturbed until further no- 
tice. Sound like you mean it.” 

Ikk clacked his palps. 

“And,” Relief added in fluent 
Voion thieves* dialect, “don’t make 
any mistakes.” He pressed the key. 

“What is it this time?** a sharp 
Voion voice came back. Relief held 
the gun aimed at Ikk’s center ventral 
plate while the Prime Minister deliv- 
ered the message. 

“Well done, Ikk.** Relief flipped 
off the switch, bent it out of line to 
render it inoperative. “You may 
yell all you like now; I have great 
confidence in Ministerial sound- 
proofing.** 

“Listen to me, Terry!** Ikk keen- 
ed. “Give up this madness! My 
troops will hunt you down without 
mercy! And what can you hope to 
accomplish alone?** 

“Ah, that’s the question, isn’t it, 
Ikk?** Relief went to the door. “And 
on that note I’ll leave you.’* 

I n the outer office, the body- 
guards standing by swivelled 
their oculars nervously at Relief. 



RETIBF'S WAR

•*Ikk’s tied up for the rest of the 
afternoon,” he said breezily. ‘‘He's 
tosy pondering some surprising new 
developments.” He stepped into the 
corridor, made his way along nar- 
row, strange-smelling passages, wind- 
kig, dipping, curiously angled, lit by 
chemical lamps and lined with cub- 
icles from which Bright Voion eyes 
glinted. 

He emerged in a cramped court- 
yard surrounded by high, curving, 
decoration-crusted walls of faded 
Burgundy and Prussian blue, gleam- 
ing in the eerie light of Second 
Eclipse. There were, if anything, 
more police gathered now than an 
hour before. A ripple seemed to pass 
across the crowd as Retief appeared. 
Twitching antenna semaphored a 
message. At once, a path opened 
through the press. 



In the street the mob was scarcely 
less dense. Voion — both polished 
police and dull-finished tribesmen — 
stood in rows, packed the parking 
ledges, jostled for wheel-space in the 
narrow thoroughfare. Here and 
there a tall bottle-green Yerkie or 
blue-and- white Clute hurried, a fur- 
tive touch of color against the sea 
of restless black. Through lighted 
rfiop windows, Quoppina of other 
tribes were visible, gathered in tight 
groups, watching the street. Except 
for a steady, subdued buzzing in the 
Voion dialects, the city was omin- 
ously silent. 

Retief strode along briskly, the 
Voion continuing to edge unobtru- 
sively from his path. On a street 
corner he paused, glanced back. 

A pair of crested Special Police 
were shouldering through, keeping 



36 



IF 



a fifty foot interval between them- 
selves and the object of the Prime 
Minister’s in^ructions. A third Voion 
came up behind them, shrilled a 
command. The two came on at a 
quick roll. 

Retief pushed on across the street, 
turned down a narrow side way. 
Ahead, there was a stir. More of the 
tall Special Police appeared, keening 
i orders to those about them. A mes- 
sage rippled across the crowd. To 
the right, three more cops had come 
into view, pushing through toward 
'him, clubs prominently displayed. 

“Maybe you’d better step in to 
avoid the crowd, Terry,” a thin 
voice said at Retief s back. 

He turned. A small, purplish, 
jlightly built Quopp of the Flink 
tribe stood in the doorway of a tiny 
lahop. He stepped bade. 

I Retief followed, danced around at 
shelves loaded with trinkets: Yalcan 
flass-work, Jaq beaten copperware, 
wooden objects from far-off Loven- 
jbroy, a dim-lit display of Hoogan 
religious mosaics featuring the 
^elve Ritual Dismemberments. 

’That one caught your eye, didn^ 
M?” die Flink said. “That’s always 
Ibeen a snappy seller with you Tct- 
Jries.” 

“It’s a winner,” Retief agreed. 
/“There wouldn’t be a back way out 
lof here, I suppose?” 

r ie Flink was staring out at the 
street. “Ikk’s up to something 
big this time; such a force he never 
had in town before. Half his tribe 
he’s got in the streets, just standing 
around like it was a signal they was 
waiting for.” He turned to look at 



Retief. “Yep, there’s a back way. 
But you won’t get far. Not if Ikk’s 
bully boys are looking for you. 
Right now, you must be the only 
Terry in Ixix still running around 
loose.” 

“That’s a distinction I’d like to 
retain,” Retief pointed out. 

“Terry, I’d like to help you out,” 
the Fli^ waggled his head. “But 
you’re as easy to spot as an off-color 
grub at a hatching ceremony.” He 
broke off, twitched vestigal wing- 
cases, producing a sharp pop. “Un- 
less . Terry, are you. game to try 
something risky?” 

“It couldn’t be any riskier than 
standing here,” Retief said. “The 
cops are closing in from aU four 
directions. 

“Come on.” The Flink flipped 
aside a hanging, waved Retief 
tfiiough into an ev^ tinier chamber 
bdund the shop, from which a num- 
b«* of dark tunnel-mouths opened — 
mere h<^es, two feet in diameter. 

“YouTl have to crawl, Tm afraid,” 
he sakL 

“One of the basic diplomatic 
sk^,” Retief said. “Lead on.” 

It was a five-minute tr^ through 
the cramped passage, which twisted 
and writhed, doubled back, rose sud- 
denly, Aen dropped, did a sharp 
jag to the left, and opened into a 
leather-and-wax smelling chamber, 
Ht by a sour-ydlow chemical lamp 
inside a glass bowl. The room was 
stacked with curiously ^ped objects 
of all sizes and colors. Retief snap- 
ped a finger against the nearest — a 
large, riiidd-ahaped panel of a shim- 
mering peariy pink. It gave off a 
metaffic bong.

•‘These look like fragments of na- 
tive anatomy,” he said. 

“Right. This is the back room of 
Sopp’s Surgical Spares; Sopp has the 
best stock in the district. Come on.” 

Hobbling on small wheels better 
adapted to trolley service than 
ground-running, the Flink led the 
way past heaped carapace segments 
of ^ossy chocolate brown, screaming 
orange, butter-yellow, chartreuse, 
magenta, coppery red. Some of the 
metallo-chitinous plates bore ribs, 
bosses, knobs, spikes; some were 
vari-colored, with polka-dots and rib- 
bons of contrasting color, or elab- 
orate silver-edged rosettes. A few 
bore feathers, scales or bristles. At 
one side were ranged bins filled with 
gears, bearings, shafts, electronic 
components. 

“Yep, for anything in the used 
parts line, old Sopp’s the Quopp to 
see,” the Flink said. “He can pull 
this off if anybody can. Wait here 
a minute.” He stepped through an 
arched opening into the display room 
beyond. 

“Hey, Sopp, close the blinds,” Re- 
tief heard him say. “I’ve got a friend 
with me that doesn’t want to attract 
any attention.” There was an an- 
twering twitter, then a clatter of 
wooden shutters, followed by more 
low-voiced conversation punctuated 
with exclamations from the unseen 
proprietor. Then the Flink called. 

Relief came through into a neat 
showroom with cases filled with 
bright-colored objects of obscure 
function, presided over by a frail- 
looking Yerkle with a deep green 
carapace half-concealed under a silk- 
en paisley-patterned shawl. He star- 



ed at Retief, looking him over like 
a prospective purchaser. 

“Well, what about it, Sopp?” the 
Flink demanded. “You’re the best 
in the business. You think you can 
do it?” 

“Well ... 1 can give it a try.” 

“Great!” the Flink chirped. “II 
this works, it’ll be the slickest caper 
pulled in this town since you rigged 
Geeper out as a Blint and he fer- 
tilized half the rolling stock in the 
Municipal Car-Barns!” 

vm 

4tVJ^ell,” the Yerkle said two 
hours later. “It’s not per- 
fect, but in a bad light you may 
pass.” 

“Sopp, it’s your masterpiece.” The 
Flink, whose name was Ibbl, rolled 
in a circle around Retief. “If I didn't 
know different. I’d swear he was 
some kind of cross-breed Jorp ia 
town for the bright lights. That set 
of trimmed-down Twilch rotors is 
perfect!” 

“Just so you don’t try to fly,” 
Sopp said to Retief. “It’s a wonder 
to me how some of you life-forms 
get around, with nothing but chemi- 
cal energy to draw on. I’ve tucked a 
few Terry food-bars in the hip-pouch 
to help keep you running.” 

“Creaking slightly, Retief stepped 
to the nearest window, a roughly 
hexagonal panel of rippled amber 
glass, backed by a closed shutter of 
dark wood. His reflection, distorted 
by the uneven surface, was startling: 
curving plates of deep maroon metal- 
lo-chitin had been snipped, warped, 
then neatly welded to form a suit 



IF 




of smoothly articulated armor which 
covered him from neck to toe. Over 
his bands, Sopp had fitted a pair of 
massive red snipping claws salvaged 
from a Grunk, operable from within 
by a system of conveniently arrang- 
ed levers. A dummy abdominal sec- 
tion from a defunct Qute, sprayed 
to match the overall color scheme, 
disguised the short Terran torso. A 
handsome set of vestigal pink wing 
cases edged in a contrasting shade of 
purplish black lent a pleasant accent 
to the shoulder region that went far 
to camouflage their width. The head- 
piece was taken from a prime speci- 
men of the Voion Tribe and spray- 
ed a metallic red-orange, and fitted 
with a crest of pink-dyed Jarweel 
plumes. It fitted lightly over Retiefs 
face, a hinged section closing down 
to clamp in place behind. 

“Of course, those big, long, thick 
legs are a bit odd,” Sopp said. “But 
with the rotating members adapted 
for rotor use, naturally the anterior 
arms have to fill in as landing gear. 
There’s a few tribes that have gone 
in for stilting around, and developed 
them into something quite useful.” 

“Sure,” Ibbl agreed. “Look at the 
Terries: No wheels, but they man- 
age okay. I tell you, he looks like 
a naturall Outside of a few unre- 
constructed Voion trying to flog him 
a set of solid gold inlays or some 
snappy photos of the tribal ovum- 
racks, nobody’ll give him a second 
look.” 

“Gentlemen,” Relief said, “you’ve 
produced a miracle. It’s even com- 
fortable. All it needs now is a ser- 
vice test.” 

“Where will you go? Ikk’s got the 



whole town sewed up tight as a cara- 
pace in moulting season.” 

“I’ll head for the Terry Embassy. 
It’s not far.” 

Sopp looked doubtful. “Farther 
than you think, maybe.” He turned 
to a wall display, selected a two- 
foot broadsword fashioned from the 
irridescent wing-case of a Blang. 
“Better take this. It may come in 
handy to, shall we say, cut your way 
through the undergrowth.” 

T he long twilight of Quopp was 
staining the sky in vivid colors 
now. Through a chink in the shut- 
ter, Relief saw lights glowing against 
the shadows blanketing the hushed 
street where the Voion waited, si- 
lent. Up high, the carved facades 
still caught the light, Reaming in 
soft pastels against the neon-bright 
sky. 

“I think it’s time to go,” he said. 
“While I still have light enough to 
see where Fm going.” 

“You want to be careful, Terry." 
Ibbl was scanning the street from 
the other window. “Those Voion 
are in a nasty mood. They’re wait- 
ing for something. You can feel it 
in the air.” 

“Fm subject to moods myself,” 
Relief said. “At the moment I think 
I could spot them high, low and 
jack and still win it in a walkaway.” 
He took a final turn up and down 
the room, testing the action of the 
suit’s joints. He checked the loca- 
tion of the power pistol with his 
elbow. It was tucked inconspicuous- 
ly behind the flare of a lateral hip 
flange, accessible for a fast draw. 
“Thanks again, fellows. If our side

39 




wins the brandies are on me,” Rel- 
ief said. 

“Good luck, Terry. If your side 
wins, remember me when it’s time 
in let the contract to junk out the 
police force.” 

‘^You’ll be the first on the list.” 
Relief worked the lever that clacked 
his anterior mandibles in the gesture 
of Reluctant Departure on Press of 
Urgent Business and left 

I t was a brisk fifteen minute walk 
to the Path of the Many Sporting 
Agents, every yard of the way im- 
peded by Voion who stared and gave 
ground only reluctantly. 

As Relief came in sight of the 
Embassy complex, he saw Voion 
clustered before the main doors in 
a solid mass. He forced his way 
closer, eliciting complaints from 
jostled sightseers. Behind the wide 
glass panels, the darting shapes of 
Dinks were working busily. A steady 
stream of Voion were coming and 
fottig, with much shrilling of com- 
mands and waggling of signals. 
There were no Terrans in evidence. 

Relief pushed into a narrow shop 
entry across the street from the 
scene of the activity, scanned the 
upper Embassy windows. There were 
ii^ts on there and once or twice 
a shape moved behind the colored 
glass panes. 

There was a distant, thudding clat- 
ter. Relief looked up, saw the vast 
shape of an immense flying Rhoon 
soar on its wide rotors across the 
strip of sky between buildings, fol- 
lowed a moment later by a second. 
Then a tiny heli appeared, bilious 
yoBow-green in color, flitting low 



above the Chancery Tower. As Re- 
lief watched, a head appeared over 
the cockpit rim — the merest glimpse 
of stalked eyes, a pale throat blad- 
der — 

“That one’s no Voion, nor no 
Terry, either,” a reedy voice said at 
Reliefs elbow. 

He looked around to see an aged 
Kloob, distinguished by a metallic 
Vermillion abdomen and small, al-

“Whoever he was, he seems to 
be on good terms with the Rhoon,” 
Relief said. 

“Never saw that before,” the 
Kloob said. “There’s unnatural 
things going on in the world these 
days. Rhoon flying over town! Like 
they was patrolling, like.” 

“I don’t see any of the Terry 
diplomats around,” Relief said. 
“What’s been going on here?” 

“Ha! What hasn’t been going on? 
First the smoke and the big bang; 
then the Voion cops swarming all 
over.” The Kloob clacked his ven- 
tral plates with a rippling noise in- 
dicating total lack of approval. 
“Things are coming to a pretty pass 
when a bunch of Voion trash can 
take over the Terry Embassy and 
make it stick.” 

“So it’s like that, eh?” Relief said. 
“What happened to the Terries?” 

“Dunno. I’m taking a short siesta 
and I wake up and all I can see is 
cops. Too bad, too. The Terries were 
good customers. I hate to see ’em

Kloob said glumly. “Ikk’s got ’em 
buffaloed. The rest of us Quoppina 
better head for the tall grass.” 

“Not a bad idea. I wonder where 
I could pick up a map.” 

“You mean one of those diagrams 
showing where places are? I’ve heard 
of ’em — but I could never quite 
figure out what they were for. I 
mean, after all, a fellow knows 
where he is, right? And he knows 
where he wants to go.” 

“That’s one of the areas in which 
we Stilters are a little backward,” 
Retief said. “We seldom know where 
we are, to say nothing of where 
we’re going. The place I’m looking 
for is somewhere to the northeast. 
That way.” He pointed. 

“More that way.” The Kloob in- 
dicated a direction three degrees to 
the right of Retief’s approximation, 
“Straight ahead. You can’t miss it 
That where your tribe hangs out? 
Never saw one like you before.” 
“There’s a group of my tribe fel- 
lows in trouble out there,” Retief 
said. “About 80 miles from here.” 
“Hm. That’s a good four days on 
a fast Blint if the trails are in 
shape.” 

“How does the port look?” 
“Guards on every gate. The Voion 
don’t want any of us travelling.” 
“I’m afraid I’ll have to argue that 
point with them.” 

The Kloob looked dubiously at 
Retief. “Well, I can guess who’ll win 
the argument. But good luck to you 
anyway, Stilter.” 

R etief pushed through the loosely 
milling crowd for half a block 
before one of the stick-twirling 



Planetary Police fSmist out an am 
to halt him. 

“You, there! Where are you go- 
ing?” he hummed in Voion Trilni. 

“Back where a fellow can dip a 
drinking organ in a short Hellroee 
and nibble a couple of sourbalk 
without some flatwheel flapping a 
mandible at him,” Retief replied 
shortly. “One side, you, before I 
pry that badge off your chest to 
give to the grubs for a play-pretty.” 

The Voion retreated. “Tell the 
other hicks to stay clear of the city,” 
he rasped. “Now get rolling before 
I run you in.” 

Retief thrust past hhn with a con- 
temptuous snap of bis left diela. The 
sun was almost down now, and few 
lamps had gone on in the shops to 
light die way. Theso was no other 
Que^pina in sight; oetf die sullen 
black of the Voion» many oi them 
with the crude shdl inlays and fded 
fangs of tribesmen. Hie port, Retkl 
estimated, would be off to the right, 
where the last purpbsh gleam of sun- 
set stni showed above the building 
tops. 

He headed that way, one elbow 
touching the butt of his hidden 
power gun.

do I bribe to get in?” Retief called 
out in Tribal. 

All four Voion spoke at once; 
then one waved an arm for silence. 
“Fm corporal of the guard here, 
rube,” he buzzed. “What have you 
got in mind?” 

“Well, now, what’s the going 
price?” Retief sauntered casually to 
a position two yards from the open 
gate.” 

“You talking Village, or Terry 
credit?” 

“Do 1 look like Fm hauling thirty 
or forty pounds of rock around 
with me?” Retief inquired. “I just 
peddled a cargo of country booze 
down at the barracks. Fve got 
enough Terry credit to hang the 
four of you with.” 

“Have you, now?” The quartet 
shifted positions to encircle Retief, 
a move which placed two of them 
farther from the gate than himself. 

“You bet.” He reached into the 
pouch slung at his .hip, pulled out 
a tangle of plastic, gained another 
step toward the corporal, who can- 
ted his oculars at the cash. 

“Here, catch,” Retief tossed the 
credit. As the NCO reached to snare 
it, the other three Voion said “Hey!” 
and converged on him. Retief step- 
ped through the gate, slammed it 
and clicked the hanging padlock 
shut, leaving the four guards outside. 

“Hold on there, you!” the cor- 
poral keened. “You can’t go in 
there!” 

“I figured you sharpies would 
hold out on me,” Retief said. “Well, 
Fm in now. You can yell for the 
sergeant and turn the bundle over 
to him, or you can forget you saw 



me and work out a fair split on the 
payoff. So long.” 

“Hey,” one of the Voion said. 
“Look at the way that stiller walks! 
Like a Terry, kind of.” 

“Are you kidding?” the corporal 
said. “Look, fellows, the way 1 see 
it, what’s it to us if this yokel wants 
to sightsee?” 

R etief moved off as the foursome 
settled down to quarreling over 
the loot and headed for the nearest 
of five ships in sight, a battered 
thousand tonner with the purple and 
yellow comet insignia of the Four 
Planet Line. The few lounging locals 
in sight ignored him as he went to 
the rear access ladder, swung up and 
stepped inside. A startled Voion 
looked up from a litter of papers and 
clothes spilled from a locker, the 
door of which had been pried from 
its hinges. As the looter reached for 
a club lying on a table, Retief 
caught his outstretched Arm, spun 
him around, planted a foot against 
his back, and launched him toward 
the open entry. The Voion emitted 
a thin screech as he shot through, 
yelped as he hit the pavement below 
with a splintering crash. 

Retief swarmed up the ladder to 
the cargo deck, rode the one-man 
lift to the control compartment, cy- 
cled the outer lock shut, then quick- 
ly checked gauges. 

“Swell,” he said softly. “Just 
enough fuel to stage a blazing re- 
entry.” He whirled to the lifeboat 
bay, cycled the hatch. Two tiny one- 
man shells rested in their slings. Re- 
tief wiped dust from the external 
inspection panel of the nearest, saw

IIm dull red glow of panic lights 
indicating low accumulator charge, 
a leaky atmosphere seal and over- 
aged fuel. He checked the second 
boat. Its accumulators read full 
charge, though it, too, was leaking 
air and indicating a decayed fuel 
supply. Retief went back to the 
panel, flipped a key, glanced at the 
ground-view screens. Voion were 
dosing in on the vessel from three 
tides. He recognized the evicted im- 
pulse shopper in the van, limping on 
an out-of-round wheel. 

He went back to the Number Two 
Hfeboat, popped the canopy, climbed 
inside, fitted himself into the cramp- 
ed scat taking care to settle his ro- 
tors and wing cases comfortable, 
then closed the hatch. He activated 
the warm-up switch; panel lights 
blinked on. 

The boat was flyable — maybe. 
Retief kicked in the eject lever and 
dammed back in the padded seat as 
tfic rocket blast hurled the tiny boat 
skyward. 

L evel at five thousand feet, Retief 
set a northeast course; as he 
looked back at the pattern of city 
lights below, a brilliant red light 
flowed, climbed upward from a 
point near ' the center of the town, 
burst in a shower of whirling pin- 
wheels of green, yellow, magenta. A 
second rocket went up, then three 
together, shedding a carnival glow 
over the clustered towers of the city. 
Retief punched a button on the tiny 
panel, twirled a dial.

effulgent chief, the great liberator 
of Quopp, Prime Minister Ikkl” 
There was a prolonged burst of 
shrill pre-recorded applause that 
made Retiefs ear drums itch, then 
the familiar tones of the Voion 
leader: 

“Fellow Voion, and you other, 
^all 1 say, honorary Voion,” he 
started. “Now that the planet is free, 
certain changes will be made. No 
longer will the unenlightened strug- 
gle on, following erroneous tribal 
customs! We Voion have figured out 
all the answers, and — ” 

Retief flicked off the radio, set- 
tled down for the eighty-mile run 
ahead. 

T he lifeboat rocked abruptly, as 
though it had glanced off a 
giant, spongy pillow. Retief banked 
to the right, scanned the sky above. 

A wide, dark shape swooped 
quickly past. There was a sudden 
buffeting as the small craft pitched 
in the back-wash of the thirty-foot 
rotors of a giant Rhoon. It swung 



in a wide circle, climbing, then piv- 
oted sharply, swooped again, hurtling 
straight at him like a vast pouncing 
eagle. 

Retief slammed the controls full 
over, felt the lifeboat flip on its 
back, drop like a stone toward the 
jungle below. He rolled out, shot 
away at full thrust, at right angles 
to his previous course. Off to the 
right the Rhoon tilted up in a sharp 
turn, faint starlight gleaming from 
its spinning rotors, swelling enor- 
mously as it closed. Again Retief 
dove under it, pulled out to find it 
close on his port side, angling in 
across his bows. He gave the boat 
full throttle, shot under the Rhoon’s 
yellow-green head, then pulled the 
nose up, climbing . 

The skiff was sluggish under him, 
staggering; he reduced the angle of 
climb, saw the Rhoon dropping in 
from his port quarter. Again he 
dived, leveled out this time a scant 
thousand feet above the dark jungle 
below. A glance to the right showed 
the Rhoon banking in for another 
pass. Its mighty rotors drove it ef- 
fortlessly at twice the speed the skiff 
could manage on its out-dated fuel. 
Retief saw its four ten-foot-long ar- 
mored fighting members, its gaping 
jaws armed with saw-edged fangs 
that could devour any lesser Quop- 
pina in two snaps. 

At the last moment, he rolled to 
the right, went over on his back, 
snapped out of the maneuver to 
whip off to the left, coming around 
sharply on the Rhoon’s flank. With 
a jerk at the release handle, he jet- 
tisoned the canopy. It leaped clear 
with a dull boom, and a tornado of 



IF 




air whipped at Relief’s face. He jerk- 
ed the power gun clear of its hol- 
ster, took aim, and as the Rhoon 
banked belatedly to the right, fired 
for the left rotor. Yellow light glared 
from the whipping blades as Relief 
held the beam full on the spinning 
hub, a spot glowed a dull red; then 
a puff of vapor whiffed up — and 
suddenly the air was filled with 
whining fragments, whistling past 
Relief’s exposed head and ricochet- 
ing off the skiff’s hull. 

Relief held the beam on target 
another five seconds, saw the Rhoon 
tilt almost vertically, vibrating wildly 
as the damaged rotor shook itself 
to pieces. Something small and dark 
seemed to break from the Rhoon 
then, clung for a moment, dropped 
free. Then the great predator was 
on its back, a glimpse of gray belly 
plates and folded legs, then gone as 
the boat shot past. 

At that moment a violent shock 
slammed Relief hard against the re- 
straining harness. He grabbed the 
controls, fought to pull the boat up. 
A flat expanse of black wilderness 
swung up past the nose, rolled lei- 
surely over the top, then slid down 
the left side . 

The controls bit into the air then. 

Fighting vertigo, Retief hauled the 
boat out of the spin. The motor 
barked once, twice, snarled unevenly 
for a moment, then died. The ship 
bucked, wanting to fall off on its 
port stub-wing. A glance showed 
torn metal, a dark strain of leaking 
coolant. The skiff was no more than 
a hundred feet above tree level now; 
ahead a tall spike-palm loomed. Re- 
tief banked to the right, felt the boat 



drop under him. He caught a mo- 
mentary glimpse of the immense 
wreckage of the Rhoon strewn 
across half an acre of bushy tree- 
tops; then he was crashing through 
yielding foliage, the boat slamming 
left, then right, then up-ended, tum- 
bling, dropping to a final splintering 
crash of metal-wood, a terrific im- 
pact that filled the tiny cockpit with 
whirling fireworks even brighter 
than the ones over the city before 
they faded into a darkness filled with 
distant gongs . 

X 

S omething sharp poked Retief is 
the side, a vigorous jab that 
bruised even through the leather 
strip that joined the dorsal and ven- 
tral plates of his costume. He made 
an effort, sat up, reached to investi- 
gate the extent of the skidl fracture, 
felt the metallic clang as his claw 
touched the painted Voion head- 
piece. The tough armor, it seemed, 
had its uses. 

He pushed the helmet into align- 
ment, looked around at a torch-lit 
clearing among the boles of great 
trees. A ring of three-foot blue- 
green Quoppina — members, he saw, 
of the Ween Tribe, — were all eye- 
ing him with faintly luminous ocu- 
lars. 

‘'Hoo. Meat-fall-from sky moving 
around,” a tiny, pentrating voice 
keened in heavily accented Tribal. 
“Us better slice it up quick.” 

Retief got to. his feet, felt for the 
gun with his elbow. It was gone — 
lost in the crash. One midget meat- 
eater, bolder than the rest, edged

closer, gave a tentative snap of lis 
immense white-edged claw. Relief 
worked levers, clacked back at him. 

‘‘Stand back, little fellow,” he 
said. “Don’t you recognize a super- 
natural apparition when you see 
one?” He moved to get his back to 
a tree. 

“What you mean, big boy?” one 
of the natives demanded. 

“It means it’s bad medicine to 
cook a stranger,” Retief translated. 

“Hmm, that mean we is got to 
cat you raw. How is you, tough?” 
Retief drew the shortsword. 
“Tough enough to give you a belly 
ache. I’d estimate.” 

“Hey, what kind of Quopp is you, 
anyway?” someone inquired. “I ain’t 
never see one like you before.” 

“I’m a diplomat,” Retief explain- 
ed. “We mostly He up during the 
day and come out at night to drink.” 
“A Dipple-mac. Hmmm. Ain’t 
never heard of that tribe before; is 
you, Jik-Jik?” 

“Can’t say as I is.” 

“How you get here, Meat-from- 
sky?” somebody called. “You ain’t 
got the wing-span for no flying.” 
“In that.” Retief nodded toward 
the smashed shell of the skiff. 

“What, that?” one native inquired. 
Another prodded the machine with 
a small wheel, adapted for rough 
jungle trails. “Whatever it is, it 
dead.” He looked at Retief. “You 
friend no help to you now, big boy. 
You is all alone.” 

“You a long way out of your 
territory, Stilter,” another said. 
“Ain’t never see one like you before. 
What you doing here?” 



“I’m just passing through,” Re- 
tief said. “I’m looking for a party 
of Terrans that wandered off-course. 
I don’t suppose you’ve seen them?” 
“I heard of them whatchacallums 
— Terrans. They twelve feet high 
and made out of jelly, I hears; and 
they takes their wheels off at night 
and leaves ’em outside.” 

“That’s the group. Any sign of 
them in these parts?” 

“Nope.” The Ween crossed their 
rear oculars, indicating negation. 

“In that case, if you’ll stand aside. 
I’ll breeze on my way and let you 
get back to whatever you were doing 
when I dropped in.” 

“What we was doing, we was 
starving, Meat-from-sky. Your tim- 
ing good.” 

“Jik-jik, you all the time talking 
to something to eat,” someone said 
from the ranks. 

T here was a sudden flurry of 
sound from the near distance, 
punctuated by shrill cries. 

“Get your feather-picking mem- 
bers off me, you ignorant clod-hop- 
pers!” a thin Voion voice screeched. 
“I’m a member of the Planetary 
Armed Forces!” 

The speech cut off in mid-sen- 
tence; threshing sounds followed. Mo- 
ments later, three Ween pushed into 
the clearing, hauling the limp figure 
of a bright-polished member of the 
Planetary Police. 

“Hoo, this evening shaping up,” 
someone said. The Voion was lying 
on his back, waving all four arms. 

It was shaping up all right, Retief 
thought. But not for him.

Time fraveling is dangerous 
sport — even when you know 
exactly what era you're ini 

T^^hen the space-time continuum 
capsule broke through it was 
to materialize approximately six 
feet above the sea. 

Fortunately, the contingency had 
been allowed for. In fact, the origi- 
nal plan had been that the break 
through take place several yards 
above hard ground, since the change 
in land contours over the centuries 
was potentially considerable. They 
had attempted to conduct the experi- 
ment in an area which would seem 
unlikely to change over much, but 
still they allowed several feet. The 
idea was that the capsule be so up- 
holstered and the occupant so out- 
fitted that a drop would be accom- 
modated. 

As a result, the capsule looked like 
nothing so much as one of the 
round, ultra-padded ‘barrels’ which, 
for some unknown reason, periodi- 



cally take an adventurer over Nia- 
gara Falls. 

Nor did the occupant dispel the 
similarities. He wore a crash helmet 
and heavy clothing. They hadn’t 
been sure whether or not the break 
through would be into winter or 
summer and had dressed him for 
the former. One can always shed 
clothing in warm season and they 
wanted to take no chances that he 
would emerge into a blizzard and 
freeze to death before making con- 
tact. 

He scrambled from the hatch, 
stared around at the water, aghast, 
then, when his craft hobbled in a 
wave, slid ignominiously into "he 
sea. 

Burdened with his heavy cloth- 
ing, and the various equipment and 
devices in his pockets, for a moment 
he thrashed wildly, feeling that sen- 



47 





salion ot being dragged into the 
depths. But then he seized control 
of himself, wrenched the crash hel- 
met from his head, took a deep 
breath, doubled over, untied and 
took off his heavy shoes. He sur- 
faced again, took another deep 
breath and slid from his jacket. He 
had been in the air and water long 
enough to know that the weather 
was such that he had no need for 
winter garments. 

H e was in better shape now. He 
stared up at the capsule, bob- 
bing there in the swell. He doubted 
very much that he could get up on 
it again. During the brief instant he 
had been atop, he had spotted a 
shoreline in the distance, but even 
though he had divested himself of 
the heavier of his clothing and 
equipment, he still doubted that he 
could make it that far. He swam 
moderately well but it was not 
his forte. Well, there was nothing 
else for it. He kicked out of his 
trousers, wrestled out of his shirt, 
leaving himself stripped to under- 
clothing. He started for the shore. 

However, the problem that con- 
fronted him was solved without dif- 
ficulty when a boat pulled around 
the capsule, two wide-eyed men 
stroking oars in unison. He was 
taken aback. He hadn’t seen the 
others before. He needn’t have jetti- 
soned his things. 

They hauled him from the water, 
gaping. He couldn’t help a twinge 
of humor. He could see they were 
fishermen from the nets and other 
tackle. He must have frightened 
them out of their wits when the 



capsule emerged into a space that 
evidently had been only a few yards 
from where they were plying their 
trade. 

He sat in the stern for a moment, 
catching his breath while they stood 
and continued to gawk at him. 

One of them said something in a 
language he couldn’t place. 

He took a better look at them. 
They were dressed in nothing but 
wisps of cloth about their middles, 
which didn’t signify much in this 
weather. It made for good sense. He 
couldn’t place their nationality, 
though off-hand he would have said 
a southern people in view of their 
moderately dark complexions. 

He looked about the boat, but this 
again wasn’t his field. It seemed an 
average enough fishing craft, un- 
doubtedly belonging to none too 
wealthy an owner, since it had no 
motor, either outboard or inboard, 
nor any other modern appurtenances. 

He thanked them and they looked 
at him blankly. 

He prided himself on his linguis- 
tic abilities, since he had lived abroad 
for varying periods of time on sever- 
al occasions during childhood and 
could speak English, German and 
French equally well and get by in 
both Italian and Spanish. All due to 
a culture conscious professor father. 

However, his rescuers continued 
to look at him blankly, no matter 
what tongue he tried. 

A movement of the capsule caught 
his eye and he came to his feet. The 
sphere was slowly turning so that 
the open hatch was sliding toward 
the surface of the sea. 

He yelled, pointed, gestured, tried 



48 



IF 




to put over to the fishermen the 
need to prevent his vessel from fill- 
ing with water and sinking. All in 
vain. They simply wouldn’t under- 
stand. They couldn’t understand. 

They were dolts. On top of every- 
thing else, he had to fall in with 
dolts. 

There was nothing for it. Within 
moments his sole contact with his 
own period, his method of return, 
was shipping water. He dropped to 
a seat again and put his head in his 
hands. 

When the capsule was gone, his 
rescuers stared at the bubbles so 
long as they lasted, then moved to 
resume their places as oarmen. They 
headed for land. 

There seemed to be a town, prob- 
ably a fishing village, he decided. 
The coast itself was fairly flat along 
here, but hills raised within a mile 
inward, and moderately high moun- 
tains were in the far distance. He 
couldn’t recognize the coast. How- 
ever, he did realize that this was 
evidently a sea, or at least a very 
large lake, rather than the ocean. 
But what sea, he hadn’t the vaguest 
idea. 

The town was evidently more than 
just a fishing village, he realized as 
they approached. There were fairly 
large sailing craft, although he could 
see no ocean going steamers. Inter- 
island sort of thing, he decided. He 
wondered briefly if he was in the 
Caribbean, and this some out of the 
way, backward community. 

And as they came still closer, for 
a brief moment he wondered if he 
had stumbled upon a movie set. 

Some of the ships were galleys. 



Those that were sailing craft hai 
strange rigs such as he had never 
seen before. 

Before they had beached, the re- 
ality came through to him. Some- 
thing had gone drastically wrong. 
Far from swinging forward from 
the middle of the 20th Century, th« 
pendulum of space-time had swung 
back. He was somewhere, in the past, 
and by the looks of these, in the 
far past. 

He had no idea of where, or when 
he was. 

H is garb, or lack of it, when they 
beached the boat, drew atten- 
tion, but not so much as he might 
have expected. And it came to him 
that the wide diversity of dress he 
noted was due to the fact that this 
was obviously a commerce center 
which drew ships from distances. 
Some of those who stood about, or 
strolled about on business bent, were 
as dark as Negroes, some of obvious 
Semetic strain. He blinked at this 
latter fact. Was it possible he was 
on the Palestine coast and these 
either Phoenecians or Hebrews of 
the days of the Kingdom? 

And then he came to an abrupt 
halt. 

Striding toward them was a war- 
rior garbed in the dress of the 
Homeric period. Helmet with horse 
plume, metal breastplate, greaves oi 
legs, heavy leather sandals, a short 
sword at his side. He could have 
stepped off a Grecian vase. 

And now the traveler from to- 
morrow could see similarly clad men 
beyond, here and there. Most of 
them were not so elaborately done

up. EviJenily, this one was an of- 
ficer ol some type. 

The warrior came to a halt before 
the two fishermen and their human 
catch and spoke to them in the lan- 
guage of which the newcomer could 
make no heads nor tails. Which sur- 
prised him. He had a smattering of 
ancient Greek from university days, 
and should have been able to pick 
up an occasional word. 

The officer, if that was what he 
was, took him in in detail and smil- 
ed. Which was reassuring. The new- 
comer’s rapidly drying undershirt, 
shorts and stockinged feet, while no 
doubt unique in the other’s eyes, 
hardly projected him as affluent. Ac- 
tually, they were physically a pair, 
being about thirty years of age, a 
few inches under six feet, possibly 
one sixty-five in weight, and both 
moderately handsome, clean-shaven 
men. 

The warrior spoke. 

The stranger shook his head. 

Finally, the other grunted amuse- 
ment, spoke to the fishermen, ob- 
viously in dismissal, since they left, 
then pursed his lips in an expression 
of amused doubt. 

He tapped himself with his right 
thumb on his breastplate and said, 
‘Tipe.” 

It seemed fairly obvious that he 
was introducing himself. The new- 
comer touched his own chest and 
said, “Lucius.” 

The warrior repeated that, nod- 
ded, then touched himself again and 
said, “Alvethna.” 

It might have been a title, a rank, 
or the family name. Lucius touched 
himself again and said, “Rostock.** 



Pipe looked at him in puzzlement, 
finally shrugged, grinned and made 
obvious motions to fall in step and 
come along. He led the way into the 
settlement, which was a bit bigger 
than Lucius Rostock had first 
thought. 

Pipe made a sweeping gesture and 
said, “Pyrgi.” Undoubtedly the name 
of the town. Lucius had never heard 
of it, but it could have some ring 
of the Greek. He was about con- 
vinced that he was in Greek hands. 

They tramped down surprisingly 
clean streets, past single storied 
houses that seemed prosperous 
enough. When a boy, his professor 
father had once taken him through 
the ruins of Pompeii. There were 
similarities, although this seemed lO 
be somewhat more gay than the 
Roman resort town could ever have 
been. 

Lucius scowled thoughtfully. The 
way he remembered it, the Greeks 
had put their wealth into public 
buildings which were magnificent, 
but supposedly, even in Athens, liv- 
ed in somewhat grim homes. This 
didn’t tie in. 

F ipe led them down the street 
to what was obviously a sol- 
dier’s post. There were horses here 
and the young officer commandeer- 
ed two. 

They took off at none too gentle 
a pace and headed inland. 

When they were clear of Pyrgi, 
Fipe grinned and gestured toward 
the hills. “Caere,” he said. 

That meant nothing to Lucius Ros- 
tock, however. About three and a 
half miles inland was a considerably 



50 



IF 




larger city than Pyrgi. In fact, it 
became obvious that the seaside town 
must be the port for this metropolis. 

The city of Caere was situated on 
elevated ground of natural forma- 
tion about three and a half miles 
from the sea. Well based for de- 
fense, it was completely surrounded 
by walls which were massive but of 
well-fitted, cut stone. Lucius failed 
to place the architecture. 

He noted the indifferent disci- 
pline of the warriors at the gate 
and grunted, having had military 
training himself. The greenest recruit 
of his own era was better trained 
than this. Pipe was obviously an of- 
ficer, but he had rated no salute 
whatsoever. Indeed, a couple of the 
spearmen had called up to him, 
laughingly. Pipe had grinned back 
at them and called an answer that 
set the men off into more laughter. 
Lucius wondered vaguely if such lax- 
ness prevailed even in combat. This 
city, he decided, would be a push- 
over for an aggressor. 

They stopped before the largest of 
the public buildings, left their horses 
in the hands of an indifferent guard, 
mounted stone steps and entered. 
Lucius was taken with no ceremony 
into the presence of a person ob- 
viously in command, a middle-aged 
type who seemed on the good na- 
tured side for a man in such posi- 
tion. He was surrounded by what 
Lucius Rostock assumed were coun- 
sellors, and there were several sec- 
retaries seated about on folding 
chairs. 

The presiding official’s name was 
evidently Larte. Lucius went through 
the attempt to communicate again. 



but achieved only smiles and laugh- 
ter. They seemed a great people for 
laughter. 

Pipe stood by his side, evidently 
proud of his charge, and explained 
to the extent he could this new phe- 
nomenon. Lucius suspected that the 
story of his method of arrival was 
being highly discounted. By how it 
was third hand. However, that he 
was here was obvious, and where he 
was from and how he had been 
transported were a mystery. 

H e found out later the orders 
Larte had issued. Pipe was to 
drop his duties and take over super- 
vising the stranger and teaching him 
the language. When Lucius was well 
enough founded, he was to be 
brought back to the assembly for 
questioning. 

Evidently, Pipe couldn’t have been 
pleased more. And evidently he 
could see no reason for the teach- 
ing of language in any such stuffy 
atmosphere as a classroom, if, in- 
deed, classrooms existed in Caere. 
Instead, he was prone to work away 
on the project whilst at the same 
time fishing, hunting, swimming, or 
better still, in the company of the 
town’s unmarried young women. 

Lucius was satisfied enough to go 
along with this, although he was 
anxious to get on with matters. He 
had no illusions about his return to 
his own era. He was stuck. Even 
had he been able to dredge up the 
space-time continuum capsule, he 
realized that the exposure to sea 
water for such a period as had 
already transpired would have de- 
stroyed the delicate mechanism.

It was a double tragedy. The ex- 
periment had not been inexpensive. 
And he doubted, now that it had 
failed, that others would be made. 
It had been difficult enough to get 
Ihe appropriations. He had to laugh 
bitterly. Not only had he not emerg- 
ed in the fulure, but not even in 
the part of the world from which he 
had started. Well, there was nothing 
lie could do about it. All the impor- 
tant issues that applied in his own 
world, his own country, to his own 
people, now meant nothing. It was 
gall to admit; he had been highly 
Evolved. 

The company of Caere’s unmar- 
ried girls was a proUem. He was 
j^aying it close to his diest. He had 
BO idea of the lancTs mores, social 
strata, nor socio-economic system. 
But he knew he was going to have 
to keep from becoming embroiled 
Id any permanent attachment, until 
he could pick a mate who would be 
an aid to his career, rather than a 
Imderance. 

He wasn’t getting very far with 
placing himself in either time or 
locale. The people of Caere called 
dieniselves Rasna or Rasenna, and 
the city-state evidently belonged to 
a loose confederation covering a 
wide area. But he could make neither 
hide nor hair of the political or 
socio-economic system. 

Lucius tried to find a clue in the 
fact that couches were used at table 
rather than chairs, and couldn’t. The 
Romans, and before them the 
Greeks had preferred the method of 
eating, but they, in turn, had most 
likely picked it up from some orien- 
tal source. 



It was at the evening banquets 
that he had to watch himself in 
regard to the women. Pipe seemed 
to dote on them, and it was all but 
a nightly thing. 

There was no avoiding a feminine 
companion. The couches were dou- 
ble, meant for a man and woman. 
Married couples, of course, shared 
a couch. Unmarried young people 
paired off. Each couple stretched out 
on their left sides, the woman snug- 
gled back against the man. It hadn’t 
been easy for the visitor from the 
20th Century to adapt to. You were 
meant to enjoy the company of your 
companion. She exchanged jests with 
you, pressed delicacies to your 
mouth, and you responded in like. 
If you wished, particularly during 
the wine course at the end of the 
meal, you kissed or exchanged other 
mild embraces. 

yt was a fine institution, perhaps, 
Rostock decided, for an engaged 
couple, but hard on one determined 
to remain a bachelor for the time 
present. 

In fact, it was at such a banquet 
and long before his command of the 
language was proficient, that Lucius 
Rostock met his future bride. He 
was later to wonder if Pipe hadn’t 
set it up. 

The girl’s name was Tanaquil and 
she was visiting from the nort’iern 
allied city of Tarquinii. Pipe let it 
be known with what Lucius decided 
was a knowing smirk, that she was 
of the Tarquinius family which evi- 
dently supplied the governors — or 
whatever the title might be — of the 
city, in the same manner that Larte 



52 



IF 




Camna’s family supplied them in 
Caere. 

Tanaquil seemed to have a repu- 
tation, though as just what, Lucius 
couldn’t make out. Perhaps it was 
for being a bit aggressive, not quite 
as feminine as Rasna taste usually 
dictated. At any rate, she made no 
objection to sharing the mysterious 
stranger’s couch at a banquet for 
unmarried couples which Pipe had 
arranged. 

It was in the preliminary stages of 
the evening, while they were being 
served their mulsum, an aperitif 
wine mixed with honey that Lucius 
realized with a thrill of discovery 
that the girl’s all but transparent robe 
was of silk. Silk! Silk came to the 
ancients only from China. But then 
he shook his head. He still knew 
nothing other than that Tanaquil 
must be on the wealthy side to be 
able to afford the fabric. It was the 
first time he had noticed it since his 
arrival. Local fabrics were cotton, 
linen and wool. 

While the musicians stationed in 
the background played the ever pres- 
ent double flute and the kithara, a 
profusion of salads, mushroom 
dishes, olives, raw vegetables, mus- 
sels and snails were brought on. 

He took in his couch mate more 
closely. She was attractive enough 
and of lighter complexion and fairer 
hair than most Rasna, which was to 
his taste. She had a certain forward- 
ness not too often run into amongst 
the Caere women. She was obvious- 
ly of strength and character. 

He caught Pipe observing him 
from the other side of the table in 
amusement and returned to his food. 



Tanaquil pressed a bit of broiled 
fish upon him. She said something 
and he frowned and tried to puzzle 
it out. 

It came through finally. 

“But of what city are you?” she 
asked. 

He told her, knowing it meant 
nothing. 

Pipe called over, “Lucius is from 
a far, unknown land where our lan- 
guage is unspoken as his is here.” 

She looked at her companion, 
calculatingly, and called out some- 
thing to Hpe. 

But it was Seius, an official of 
Pyrgi, who answered. He had picked 
up the habit of speaking slowly 
when Lucius was involved, as had 
Pipe, and Rostock could follow him 
almost as well as he could his tutor. 

Seius said lighdy, “He tells us he 
is a warrior and leader of men in 
his own land, and of the family of 
lucomones.” 

Tanaquil looked at Rostock from 
the side of her eyes, which were 
gray, rather than the usual brown of 
this area. 

The mensae primae courses began 
to arrive, consisting largely of poul- 
try dishes, and Lucius could hardly 
fail to notice that his companion 
from the north had snugged back 
against him more comfortably. 

Later, during the wine, she was 
called to dance in the method of 
a city of which Lucius had as yet 
not heard, Voltumna. They were 
all loudly merry, by this time, little 
water having been added to the wine, 
and everybody was highly amused 
by the fact that largely she danced 
for him.

T hough the language of the Rasna 
came to him slowly, come it 
did and eventually he could carry 
on well enough that Pipe let him 
know that Larte had suggested an 
interview before the assembly. 

Larte and the assembly, Lucius 
bad come to find by now, were the 
governing body of Caere, to the 
extent that there was government at 
all. The looseness of the body as- 
tonished the man from the future. 
Evidently, it consisted of a represen- 
tative from each of the city’s fami- 
lies, or clans, call them what you 
will. 

As before, they met in the as- 
•cmbly building, the largest of the 
city’s public edifices, other than 
the temples, of which precious little 
was known by Lucius Rostock. An 
atheist, in his own time, he wished 
to lay himself open to no mistakes 
that might stymie his chances in this 
strange culture, and there is no field 
in which it is easier to make mis- 
takes than in religion. 

Lucius made the gentle gesture 
of respect that Pipe had taught him 
was applicable before the city head, 
and waited for the older man to 
speak. Pipe stood to one side, beam- 
ing at his protege. 

Larte took in the informal Rasna 
garb which Pipe had supplied and 
which in this weather consisted of 
little more than an embroidered lin- 
en kilt.' He smiled and said easily, 
“You could well be one of us, O 
Lucius.” 

It was as good an opening as any. 
Lucius said strongly, “That is my 
greatest desire, Larte Camna.” 

The assembly fell silent. 



Lar.e tro .vncd and said, “How do 
you mean, Lucius?’' 

It was boldness now, or never. 
“In my few months in Caere, I have 
noted many things in which I believe 
I could be of great service to the 
city. Given your cooperation, 1 am 
of the belief that I could become a 
valuable citizen, eventually promi- 
nent in the nation’s workings. I am 
ambitious, Larte, that 1 will admit, 
but it is through the efforts of am- 
bitious men that the city progresses.” 

One of the assemblymen, recog- 
nized by Rostock as Oenus, head of 
the Vipinas clan, said softly, “Pro- 
gress in what manner, Lucius? 1 am 
distressed that you seem to feel our 
society less desirable than the far 
land with which you are familiar.” 

He had to tread gently now, even 
Pipe was frowning faintly. 

Lucius nodded. “I was a leader of 
warriors in my own land. There were 
many wars and I acquired great 
knowledge in the field. I can make 
this available to Caere and its peo- 
ple.” 

“And who would we use it 
against?” Larte said, shaking h» 
head. 

“Against your enemies!” Was the 
man dense? 

“But what enemies? 

“Come now, I know your confed- 
eration spreads over a wide area, 
but there is often conflict between 
the different cities. Prom what Pipe 
tells me, only last year Sutri’s war- 
riors raided your cattle and were 
only driven off after desperate bat- 
tles.” 

Larte chuckled. “He failed to 
mention that the year before, he par- 



54 



IF 




ticipated in a similar raid on Sutri.” 
He made a gesture of dismissal. 
“Young men need exercise and prac- 
tice with their weapons. Seldom are 
men killed or seriously injured in 
such affrays.” 

Lucius couldn’t help but stare at 
the older man. “But with the meth- 
ods I could teach you, the Mace- 
donian phalanx, the catapult — I ag- 
onize because I am not enough the 
chemist to give you gunpowder — 
the very techniques with which I 
am familiar, you could spread your 
domination over this part of the 
world!” 

It was Pipe who said, scowling 
jnizzlement, “To what end?” 

L ucius was as dumbfounded as 
they, but for opposite reasons. 
“Why, you could enrich yourselves. 
Caere would be the leading city for 
a distance it would take a man a 
score of days to march,” 

Larte said, not unkindly. “Lucius 
of the clan of Rostock, you fail to 
understand our institutions. Suppose 
we marched against Tarquinii and 
our warriors conquered the city. 
How could we govern them? This 
assembly consists of the heads of our 
dans, but in Tarquinii they have 
other clans.” 

Lucius gaped. The man sounded 
Mke a child. Could their knowledge 
of political fact be this primitive? 

He said impatiently, “You would 
rule them! They need not be repre- 
sented in the assembly of Caere at 
all!” 

Larte shook his head. “But why? 
It is troublesome enough to rule our 
own city.” 



“You could use them to work the 
fields, free you from your labors, 
give you time to partidpate in your 
wars, your government! Don’t you 
see? Once you had defeated them in 
battle, they could be forced to do 
your bidding.” 

Ocnus spoke up again, softly as 
usual. 'T am afraid, Ludus diat we 
have no interest in forcing others to 
perform our tasks.” He looked at 
Pipe. “You have found a strange 
one. 

The warrior didn’t answer. He was 
as bewildered as (he real 

Lucius Rostock realized he had 
pulled a boner. These dohs were in- 
capable of realizing his potentiali- 
ties. He had better repair his bridges 
while he could. 

He said quickly, “I have much to 
learn. But I am anxious to become 
a citizen of your city, to participate 
in your affairs.” He tried a jest. 
“Who knows, perhaps one day I may 
occupy your position, O Larte.” 
He knew the office was elective. 

The assembly fell silent again. 

Surely they had heard his chuckle 
of self deprecation. 

Pipe said, “I am afraid my teach- 
ing has been inadequate, Lucius. 
You see, there is no manner in 
which you can participate in our 
government. You are of the clan of 
Rostock, but there is no clan of 
Rostock in Caere. You can never 
become a citizen of the city, f.ar 
from achieving to the rank of lu- 
como.” 

It was Seius, who was present as 
representative from Pyrgi, who said, 
his tone light, “Perhaps Lucius 
should go south to Roma. It is said 



A LEADER FOR YESTERYEAR 



55 




that Ancus Marcus, the rex, con- 
tinues the policy of receiving strang- 
ers into the asylum on the Palatine. 
All are welcome.” 

''Roma!” Lucius snapped. His eyes 
went around him, to Larte, to Pipe, 
to all the others. 

“What is the matter?” Larte said. 
“It is a city but a day’s march to 
the south, and immediately across 
the River Tiberis.” 

Lucius Rostock stared at him. 
“Lucomo? I thought I should have 
placed that term. Roma? Romel” 
He pointed a finger, unthinkingly. 
“You’re Etruscans! This is Italy!” 
Larte was evidently wearying of 
the discussion. He said to Pipe, 
“Continue to instruct and entertain 
the stranger, Lucius. Undoubtedly, 
in the future we will find it instruc- 
tive to learn more of this strange 
land of his birth. We will notify you 
when another interview seems desir- 
able.” 

Pipe saluted and turned to his 
charge, who was stiU standing as 
though thunderstruck. 

O n their way back to the quarters 
they shared, Pipe looked at 
him from the side of his ey^s. “You 
mre a strange one, Lucius.” 

The other’s thoughts had been go- 
ing off in a dozen directions. “Lis- 
ten,” he demanded. “Would it be 
possible for me to wed, well, say 
Tanaquil?” 

“Why not, if she loves you?” 
“And would I not, then, become 
a member of her clan, the Tarquin- 
ius?” 

Pipe marvelled at him. “Of course 
not. You are and will always remain 



a Rostock. Were you to wed, your 
children, of course, would become of 
the clan of Tarquinius, but you will 
always remain a Rostock.” 

The mother right! Descent was 
in the matrilineal line! 

Pipe was frowning at him. “Is it 
otherwise in your own land? Perhaps 
you follow the customs of the Lat- 
ins, who trace descent through the 
male.” 

That brought up something else. 
Lucius ignored the question and said 
urgently, “This city of Roma. Tell 
me about it. How long has it been 
established? What was this Seius 
said about it being possible for me 
to become a citizen there?” 

pipe shrugged. “It is a rough 
city, filled with undesirables. How 
old? A century or so, I suppose.” 
He twisted his mouth, as though 
to aid memory. “The story has it 
that the city was founded by a cer- 
tain rex of the Ramnes tribe named 
Romulus, through I suspect him of 
being more legendary than anything 
else. He moved the tribe which con- 
sisted of ten curiae, subdivided into 
a hundred clans, onto the Palatine 
hill near the River Tiberis. Later 
they first defeated, then induced the 
Sabine tribe to join them. The Sa- 
bines took over the Quirinal and the 
Capitoline Hills.” 

“But what’s this about strangers 
being welcome?” 

Pipe scratched his chin with a 
thumbnail in puzzlement. “They 
adopted a strange custom, in order 
to continue to swell the city, though 
why they should wish that is a my- 
stery, it is already one of the largest 
in the confederacy. At any rate, 



56 



IF 




Romuius opened an asylum and in- 
vited all to join. This hoJge-podge 
tribe is known as the Luceres and 
though it has full representation in 
the Roman Senate, as they call their 
assembly, I doubt if thus far there 
are a full hundred clans. The pres- 
ent rex, a rank corresponding to our 
lucomo, is Ancus Marcus and he 
continues the asylum.” 

Lucius said tightly, “And if I 
were to marry Tanaquil and journey 
there, I would be welcome?” 

“Why not? Especially since your 
children would be of the highly pres- 
tigious clan of the Tarquinius.” 
Pipe looked at him from the side of 
his eyes again. “Tell me, Lucius, for 
what reason did you come from 
your own land to this? And why do 
you not return?” 

Lucius had to keep on terms with 
this man, if his rapidly maturing 
plans were to go through. He said, 
“My vessel, in which I arrived, has 
been destroyed and none other will 
do. I cannot return. Why did I 
come?” He looked off into a far 
distance. “In my own land, a great 
war raged and my country was faced 
with defeat. New, advanced weapons 
were needed. In hopes of finding 
them in ... in other, far lands, I was 
sent to explore, with the intention of 
returning with such weapons and 
confounding our enemies. I have 
failed.” He breathed in deeply. His 
story, in actuality, was not false. 

Pipe said, in a certain compas- 
sion, “You are well away from this 
warlike country, Lucius. Here you 
will find a new place. Wed a Rasna 
girl and find useful outlet for your 



energies.” He twisted his mouth. 
“Other than war, of course. None 
save citizens can join in our de- 
fense. You could never participate 
in our government, as we have told 
you, but your diildren would be full 
citizens, through theii mother.” 

Lucius said, “1 think instead, 
friend Pipe, that my path will take 
me to Roma.” 

They had reached the house. Pipe 
shrugged. “It is your decision.” lie 
disappeared into the building. 

Lucius Rostock stood outside. The 
house was well located, overlooking 
what he now knew must be the Tyr- 
rhenian Sea. Now that he knew 
where he was, both in time and 
space, he stared unblinkingly in the 
direction, where two and a half mil- 
lennia hence the land of his btrdi 
would be. 

He would go to Rome and theca 
spread to the extent of Ins poweiB» 
the teachings on which he had been 
raised. Of a sudden, he haled k 
here. He hated Caere and Us people^ 
and he hated the soft, lax insdln- 
tions of the place. There was a 
stink of democracy. 

No matter w! at the distance in 
time, he would keep the faith. His 
background would not go to naught 
He snapped to attention, his eyes 
straight ahead. No matter the dis- 
tance, he would follow such a path 
as the Fuhrer would have been 
proud of. 

He saluted, a salute which, unbe- 
knownst to Oberst Lucius von Ros- 
tock, was to come down to his own 
era, from this.

TTiey were a thin line back in the 
Pacific when the shaken auditors 
were able to lift their bruised bodies 
from the beach. 

The lieutenant was a very intelli- 
gent man. Anybody who could be 
spared from the incessant labor of 
food-production for an overcrowded 
world had to be intelligent to rise 
above the common herd. He knew 
at once he had two imperative 
duties : first, to save face by arresting 
the chlorella-gatherers to keep them 
from talking; second, to convince his 
superiors of the truth of this incredi- 
ble happening and to force the 
persuasion up through the ranks of 
officialdom luitil it reached some- 
body whose responsibility was se- 
cure. 

Half a dozen times in the next 
fevered days it was pure chance that 
the whole unbelievable situation did 
not bog down. But somehow the 
message penetrated the ranks of 
command until on this afternoon 
Director General Stort stood face 
to face with a row of water-filled 
tanks and found himself in colloquy 
with something that to his amazed 
but scientific eye (he had once been 
professor of genetics in the Pan- 



TUE SMIUNG FUTURE 



59 




Scandinavian University) could be 
nothing but a super-dolphin. 

T he sleek gray head with its big 
smiling mouth and its calm, 
direct, opaque eyes gazed back at 
him with equal interest. Obviously 
his thoughts had been read. 

“You are quite right,” said the 
leader politely. “In fact, I might say 
that you can thank yourselves for 
our existence. For 550 years now 
you have been dumping atomic 
waste into the oceans — in lead 
containers, to be fure; but in time 
they leak. 

“You have known that, and you 
have known Aat in consequence all 
salt-water fish have been irradiated 
until they are no longer fit for you 
to eat. Therefore you have planted 
the oceans ten feet deep with chlo- 
rella, which can be decontaminated, 
and left the deeper waters alone. 

“What you have not known is that 
this same irradiation has caused 
specific genetic changes in us also 
— the dolphins, the whales, all of 
us whose home is the sea but who 
also breathe air. Only, in our case, 
the mutation has b^n beneficent, 
not maleficent. Not only are we the 
descendants of those who could 
survive deeper pressures, but our 
mental powers have increased ten- 
fold. 

“With all modesty, I may say that 
my own kind had ^e best brains to 
start with, and we still have. The 
whales and their kind are very useful 
to us; but we are toe rulers.” 

Stort was ao bemused he forgot 
tVr a moment the reason for his 
visit 



“How have you learncJ lo :.p:ak 
English?” he asked. 

Dolphins always smile; but ihe 
^ smile widened. 

“We could always speak, even in 
the old days. You must know that: 
you took some of our ancestors 
captive and taught them your lan- 
guage. We speak all the tongues of 
men who dwell along the coasts of 
the world. We learned them very 
simply — by spies who frolicked in 
the shallow waters and listened and 
reported. 

“It just happens that, as your 
main seat of world government is in 
this part of the land area, ours is in 
this section of the seas, so naturally 
when someone was appointed to deal 
with you, they chose one who could 
speak the language of the nearest 
land-region. 

“But let us talk of more impor- 
tant things. I am here to give you 
an ultimatum.” 

Stort stiffened. 

“Excuse me,” said the leader 
suavely. “1 did not mean to use an 
offensive word. Perhaps I do not 
know your tongue as well as I 
think I do. Let me say rather that 
I am here to give you a warning? 

“What kind of warning? And by 
what authority?” Stort’s tone still 
bristled. 

The harsh voice dropped to a 
sibilant whisper. 

“You know a little of our powers. 
I should be most reluctant to have 
to demonstrate how far we are in 
control. I am here at all only be- 
cause of our sense of justice and 
our generosity. Do not push us too 
far. I implore you, as one living

IP 




being to another, to take us with 
the utmost seriousness. Believe me, 
the fate of your whole kind is in 
your hands today.” 

S tort felt a chill creep over him 
— whether bom of premoni- 
tion or induced by the stranger he 
did not want to know. 

am only a representative,” he 
•aid, in a more conciliatory manner. 
“I can carry messages. I cannot 
make final decisions by myself — 
and certainly not instant ones.” 

Hie leader seemed taken aback, 
mean you are not yourself 
ise chief authority?” it asked. “That 
is not the way in which our society 
is constituted. Is there no one, 
then, to whom we may speak once 
lor all? Time is running out fast.” 
Start made up his mind. He was 
aghast at the prospect but he dared 
not take the risk of refusing, after 
what be had already seen and heard. 

“Only the assembled United Re- 
gions can consider any information 
you have to offer,” he said coolly. 
•If you mean it in good faith, you 
must arrange to cross the continent 
and apeak to them where they meet.” 
For the first time die super- 
ddphin seemed non-plussed. 

am sorry,” it said, “but that is 
lotaHy impossible. We are not equip- 
ped for land travel — it is all we 
could do, with the aid of trained 
crabs and octopuses, to devise these 
containers you see, and to come in 
this far on the waves. 

“We shafl help all we can, with 
our mental influence, to make your 
mission successful; but your assem- 
My. or enough of them to make and 



implement decisicHis, must meet us 
here.” 

The leader paused. 

“I cannot impress it upon you too 
strongly that there is no time to 
lose. We cannot delay much longer. 
You have the means of flying back 
and forth across the continent. I oaa 
give you no more than another 
seven days. Even then it may be too 
late.” 

Stort never knew how much wae 
his own position and influence, how 
much the hypnotic ability of the 
super-dolphins, whidi seemed ua^* 
dianged by (hstance. It was toudi 
and go. Perhaps curiosity and 
creduhty had as much to do with 
it as anything — and the fact that 
the United I^egions would foot the 
bill. But a week from that day three 
hyper jet planes, each holding a hun- 
dred passengers landed in ut- 
most secrecy at the nearest airport, 
and soon a^r, 260 delegates to the 
UR (a clear majority) and 40 tech- 
i^ians with all their equipment, 
gathered on the wide beach, cleared 
for the day of ohlorella-gatherers. 

They waited an hour, and some 
were ^ready restless and complain- 
ing, when at last die thin line ap- 
peared to the west, and in a few 
minutes scores of the water-filled 
tanks that kept the super-dolphins 
comfortable were ranged opposite 
them at the edge of the sea. 

This time, however, the spokes- 
man was apparently someone of far 
higher rank than the envoy with 
whom Stort had spoken. Apparently, 
because to human eyes the smiling 
invaders all looked alike. But the 
first words set them straight. 



THE SMtUHO FUTURE

44T am glad/’ the dolphin said, 
J. “that you have heeded the 
injunction of the messenger we sent 
to you. Believe me, it is purely for 
your own sakes that we have put 
you to this trouble. I am authorized 
both to explain the situation to you, 
to make our final offer, and to 
receive your prompt acceptance — 
for I cannot imagine that you vill 
not accept this one chance for your 
racial survival. 

“But first, to make things plain, 
I must ask your speaker a few 
questions. You will understand that 
our knowledge of you land-people 
is necessarily limit^ to what our 
spies have been able to see and hear 
along all the coasts of all the oceans. 
Unfortunately our cousins in fresh 
waters have not mutated as we 
have, and so we have not been able 
to secure much information from 
them. 

“Am 1 correct in assuming that 
diere is a certain amount of over- 
population among you land-dwell- 
ers?” 

There was some sardonic laughter 
from the men and women gathered 
on the shore, and a confused babble 
of voices. The super-dolphin’s ex- 
pression could not change, but it 
gazed pointedly at Stort as the 
appointed spokesman. 

The Director General drew a deep 
breath. 

“Unhappily,” he said, “you are 
only too right. For 500 years now 
mankind has been over-producing 
itself, and despite immense efforts 
we have been unable to cut our 
population down to the optimum 
size. Contraception, sterilization. 



abortion have all failed to compete 
adequately with the conquest of 
disease and the consequent increase 
m life expectancy, rhe one thing 
we have not been able to eradicate 
from human nature is the selfish 
desire of most individuals to per- 
petuate themselves, or their preju- 
dices which prevent ihe establish- 
ment of proper eugenic standards.” 

“Strange!” exclaimed the official. 
“We had always understood that, 
next to ourselves as we have evolved, 
human land-dwellers were the most 
intelligent beings on earth. When ne 
found ourselves faced with this 
problem, we found a solution though 
we had not your means of solving 
it; but you — 

“But more of that later. Isn’t the 
result the overcrowding of your 
living areas?” 

“So much so,” Stort replied, “that 
merely to feed this immense popu- 
lation takes practically every inch 
of earth that will grow vegetables 
or animals for men to eat. There 
has been one good result — wars 
have become obsolete and all man- 
kind is united in a single effort to 
raise food. Our planet has become 
one huge food-factory, and the vast 
majority of the inhabitants arc 
engaged in this one industry.” 

“By the whole planet, I take it 
you mean that smaller part which 
is dry land. But where then do you 
live?” 

“That is our greatest problem. We 
had hoped to colonize the other 
planets of this solar system, or even 
to go beyond them to other sys- 
tems. But every effort to do so has 
failed; the vast amounts of money 



62 



IF 




needed to make it possible cannot 
be spared from the amount neces- 
sary merely to raise enough food to 
keep mankind alive. 

“Where do we live? We live, 
crowded together, with the individ- 
uality and leisure our ancestors knew 
a luxury none of us can afford, on 
mountain tops, in the few deserts 
we cannot irrigate, in barracks in 
the factory’-farms themselves, but 
mostly in a vast network of under- 
ground tunnels. A few, who are 
very rich, live in satellite tracts 
above the stratosphere.” 

4C'"T^hat is even worse than we 
A had anticipated,” said the 
stranger slowly. “If we had known, 
perhaps we would have been able 
to postpone our solution of our own 
difficulties untfl you had found a 
better one for yours. But it is too 
late now. 

“We did, though, from the begin- 
ning try to consider your welfare in 
making our plans. I shall not conceal 
from you the fact that there are two 
major schools of thought among us 
concerning you land-people. One 
very large group feels that you have 
not fulfilled your promise as a 
species, and that the time has come 
for your cxthjction. The other, which 
I myself represent, is still slightly in 
the majority. It feels that it owes 
you a certain gratitude, because — 
quite without any intention on 
your part, I grant — you made us 
what we are. 

“I am sure that we, or any others 
of us who dwell in the ocean, never 
entered your minds when you 
dumped your atomic waste in our 



living-space. Nevertheless, it is solely 
because of this inadvertent action 
on your part, that we dolphins, and 
to a certain extent the whales, have 
mutated into the highly evolved 
beings we are now. We are by nature 
altruistic. We feel that even acci- 
dental benefactors should be pro- 
tected if it is at all possible. That ii 
why we are making this attempt to 
save at least some of you.” 

“To save us from what?” Stort 
inquired bluntly. 

There was no change in the super- 
dolphin’s face, but Stort could have 
sworn that the small black eyes 
gazed on him with compassion. 

“From certain and universal 
death,” it said. 

There was a murmur from the 
throng listening through their ear- 
phones. The speaker raised a flipper 
for silence. 

“We too,” it went on, “have our 
serious population problem. We too 
are finding our living-space insuffi- 
cient for civilized existence. We 
can’t make room for ourselves by 
destroying all other life except the 
edible — which in our case meana 
the fish, poisonous now to you but 
not to us.” 

The fish. And it was true that 
no animal lived on earth any longer 
which could not be used as humaa 
food. 

“Therefore we find it necessary to 
make the whole planet our dwelling- 
place.” 

“How?” asked Stort hoarsely. 

“You know there are many rifti 
and faults in the earth’s orusit — 
more of them under the sea than 
in the land. There is a very deep 



THE SMILING FUTURE 



<3 




one in the mid-Pacific; there are 
others, almost equally deep, in the 
southern portion of that ocean you 
call the Atlantic. When there is a 
break in any of them it can alter 
the whole relation of sea and land. 

“We have no machinery, but we 
have unlimited animal strength at 
our service. With the help of our 
trained whalea, we have found that 
these rifts can be widened and 
opened. We have known that for a 
long time, and have abstained from 
action because we wished to protect 
you — which I feel in all honesty 
is more than you would have done 
for us in like circumstances. 

“We can no longer do so. Our 
population has increased too greatly, 
and unlike you we have no techni- 
cal means of regulating it. You have 
such means, but you have refused to 
enforce them. There is only one way 
by which we can find enough room 
fOT us to live and build our society 
for any conceivable time to come. 

“We are going to open all the 
lifts and flood the earth.” 

S tort darted a glance at those 
nearest to him. He saw faces 
as white as his own must be. 

“You can’t do that!” he gasped. 
“It would be inhuman!” 

Again the fixed smile seemed to 
widen. 

“That,” the dolphin official said 
succinctly, “would hardly be a con- 
sideration with us.” 

Pandemonium broke out. The 
throng of delegates went berserk. In 
a hundred different languages they 
screamed, howled, bellowed. The 
super-dolphins stood unmoved. 



It was not any from the “under- 
developed” Asian or African Region, 
but two from Europe and one from 
North America who broke out from 
the crowd and dashed toward the 
row of tanks, forbidden ray-guns in 
dieir hands. They took only a few 
steps before they fell on the sand, 
paralyzed as had been the police- 
men and the chlorella-gatherers at 
the first encounter. 

“Don’t be foolish,” said the super- 
dolphin mildly. “You can’t hurt us. 
And if you could, you would be only 
hurting yourselves, since I come 
bearing a suggestion by which some 
of you at least might be saved.^’ 

Scared and sobered, the delegates 
fell silent. 

“Tell us your offer,” Stort said. 

The spokesman waited until the 
limp bodies had been carried to one 
side. All this time the other dolphins 
had neither spoken nor stirred. Now, 
at a nod from their leader, two of 
them detached themselves and surf- 
boarded their tanks down to watch 
over the stricken three. Then, with 
a glance of approval at Stort, the 
leader spoke again. 

“You cannot live at all in our cle- 
ment,” it began. “And we cannot live 
wholly in yours. We breathe air, as 
you know, just as you do, but we 
must live for the most part under 
water. You can swim in water, but 
you must spend most of your time 
in the air. 

“We cannot adapt to land-living; 
we should be dehychated in no time. 
That is why, for these meetings 
with you, we must stay in these 
containers, under water except when 
we come usp to breathe or speak.

“We can do nothing for you 
yourselves. But if your progeny 
means so much to you, we can see 
to it that your race shall not die al- 
together.” 

“How?” Stort’s voice was thick 
with strain. 

Instead of answering, the leader 
turned to its companions. There was 
a whistling hubbub in their own 
speech muffled to human ears be- 
cause the voices came not from 
mouths but from blow-holes. Then 
the leader turned to Stort again. 

“Do you realize,” it said, “that 
when we flood the land it will mean 
all the land? Your highest mountains 
will be drowned, your underground 
tunnels will be flooded. Even those 
you say live on satellites will slowly 
starve to death, since I assume their 
food is imported from earth.” 

The delegates’ loud-speakers burst 
forth in a hullabaloo of (M'otest, 
threat, and pleading. The dolphin 
leader stood unmoving and un- 
moved. 

“We’ll kill you all first!” yelled 
an Italian delegate. “Murderers!” 
screamed a delegate from Outer 
Mongolia. “Have mercy on us,” 
pleaded a delegate from Syria. 
“Give us time at least to find a way 
to save ourselves!” pleaded a Vene- 
zuelan. 

S tort stopped them with a ges- 
ture. His face was ashen under 
his fair hair. 

“Sir,” he said to the stranger, “I 
do not know your name — ” 

“We have no names.” 

“Then, sir, let me ask you: is this 
decision irrevocable?” 



“Unfortunately for you, yes. We 
have tried every other way possible 
to us, and failed.” 

“How much time have wc?” 

“I told you I represented a major- 
ity. But it is a small majority. Our 
opponents were unwilling to give us 
even time to warn you.” 

“Then,” said Stort, “you might as 
well have saved us and yourselves 
the effort, unless you really have 
some way out for us. 

“You must know that our w>hole 
economy is based on automatic 
machinery, aiKl that even if any of 
us could survive they couldn’t sur- 
vive long as a society. They couldn’t 
even live on sea-food, for that is 
poison to us now, thanks to our own 
stupidity. Oh, yes. I’m not exonerat- 
ing us; perhaps we deserve to die. 
But if we can even leave descen- 
dants, diat would be better than 
nothing. 

“So, do you really have anydiing 
feasible to suggest to us? K not, k 
would have been kinder to let 
disaster come upon us without fore- 
knowledge.” 

“Stort,” said the dolphin, “you are 
a brave and wise man. You are the 
first land-animal I have heard of 
whom I should think almost worthy 
to be one of us. 

“I wish it had been possible to 
spare you and any oth^ of your 
breed who are like you. It is not. 
But there is one chance, if you 
hurry, to prevent your utter ex- 
tinction.” 

“What is it?” asked Stort eagerly. 
“Whatever it is — ” 

There was an affirmative murmur 
from the throng behind him. 



THE SMILING FUTURE

“In the natural order of things, 
our two species oould never inter- 
breed. But we have found that 
among our own people we can, by 
our mental powers, alter the chro- 
mosomal pattern. We have been 
able to produce experimental crosses 
with other species of mammals — 
none, yet, as far removed from us 
as you; but there seems to be no 
insuperable obstacle. 

“We are a proud people, and we 
do not like to mix our blood with 
that of inferiors. But we are also a 
just and generous people. We owe 
you what reparation we can make 
for what, to preserve ourselves, we 
are obliged to inflict upon you. It 
is a great, great sacrifice, but we 
have volunteered for it. At least we 
can console ourselves that your 
presence here must mean that you 
are among the most worthy of 
your kind. 

“The party among us which is 
impatient for action may not wait 
for our return. But if any or all of 
you wish to take advantage of our 
offer, here and now, we are willing.’* 
There was a profound silence. 
Then Stort said stiffly: 

“You mean — there are females 
among you here?” 

“I supposed you would know that 
we are all females,” said the leader. 
“Female dolphins have always been 
more intelligent than the males. Few 
males among us could become im- 
portant members of our government, 
such as we are.” 

The silence continued. Some dele- 
gates prayed. Several fainted. 

“There is no time to lose,” the 
harsh voice said. “We have wasted 



too much already. If you wish to 
preserve your human genes — ” 

S uddenly all the super-dolphins 
raised their heads abruptly 
from their tanks. They conversed 
agitatedly among themselves. 

Something’s happened, they’ve 
sensed something, Stort thought. We 
need a miracle. Perhaps it’s come. 

He turned to the ranks of dele- 
gates. In the faces before him he 
saw fear, disgust, anger, hesitation, 
stoical resolution in a few. 

“I think,” he said quietly, “our 
visitors have something new to tell 
us.” He turned expectantly. 

“I am truly very sorry,” the leader 
said. “We have waited too long. Time 
has run out. We have just received 
a mental message from our head- 
quarters. In our absence, our oppo- 
nents have overcome us. Our offer 
must be withdrawn. 

“We could sd!l do one thing for 
you — we could put you all to sleep.” 
“No!’“ cried mankind’s last defi- 
ance of fate. 

The super-dolphins turned without 
another word and glided back into 
the breakers. 

And while the delegates stood in 
dread, eyes fixed on the ocean, 
something else arose on the horizon. 

A wall of water so high it blotted 
out the sinking sun. 

So that now we who inherited all 
the planet Earth will never know 
whether we could have mingled with 
the only other terrestrial race that 
came near to our own mentality. 

Centuries later, we still keep 
finding the buried skeletons of what 
was once the Race of Man. END

T he woolly mammothmobile lying 
on its side in the pinaster grove 
was a dead ringer for the one Far-

than life, gleaming of tusk guns; 
authentic down to the minutest de- 
tail. Even if he hadn’t followed its 
well-defined trail all the way from

Iflusfrated by MORROW 



at once that it was the property of 
the two IPS employees he had re- 
turned to the Upper Paleolithic to 
find. 

Frowning, he drove his own wool- 
ly mammothmobile deeper into the 
grove, opened the ear-hatch, extend- 
ed the Jacob’s ladderette, and climb- 
ed down to the ground. After mak- 
ing certain that his numb-gun was 
riding properly on his right hip, he 



67 



approached the fallen paleethnolo- 
gi vehicle warily. The heavy woollike 
material covering its thick steel skin 
was torn in several places and there 
was an ugly hole the size of a silver 
dollar in the region of its right hip. 
The ear-hatch had been forced open 
from the outside and hung forlornly 
on one hinge. 

Farrell clambered up the flexible 
trunk-cannon to the temple and 
peered down into the cockpit. As 
he did so, a pungent odor touched 
his nostrils. Only one thing could 
be responsible for it — a burned-out 
powerpac. Clearly, whatever it was 
that had burned the hole in the 
mammothmobile’s hip had found its 
mark. 

H is bewilderment mounting, he 
lowered himself into the cock- 
pit. The control board, the automatic 
retro-co-ordinate calculator, and the 
lumillusion panel had been smashed 
beyond repair, apparently with a 
blunt instrument of some kind. The 
upholstery covering the two bucket 
seats had been tom to shreds. He 
crawled through the hatch behind 
the seats into the compact cabin. 

The couch-bed had been stripped 
of its coverings, the food locker had 
been forced open and robbed of its 
contents, and the spare-parts bin 
had been overturned. The clothes 
cubicle had been broken into and 
mangled clothing — most of it wom- 
en’s — was scattered everywhere. 
Stone Age teenagers? 

Farrell didn’t think so. He would 
sooner believe it was the work of 
adults — Cro-Magnon adults, in all 
fikelihood. There were still a few 



Neanderthals around, but they were 
well on their way toward extinc- 
tion. 

None of which explained the hole 
in the paleethnologivehicle’s hip. 

He had activated his pocket torch 
in order to view the interior of the 
cabin; now he directed its beam into 
the posterior compartment, where 
the powerpac was housed. The unit 
was burned out all right — burned 
out beyond repair. So intense had 
been the heat to which it had been 
subjected, in fact, that some of its 
parts had fused. 

He returned to the cockpit, climb- 
ed through the ear-hatch, and used 
the temple as an eminence from 
which to survey his surroundings. 
The pinaster grove constituted part 
of the flora of a vast tableland that 
would someday be known as the 
south central plateau of France. In 
the east, young mountains showed. 
To the south and west, the plateau 
stretched verdantly away into the 
mists of distance. To the north, al- 
though he could not see’ it at the 
moment because of the trees, lay the 
glittering whiteness of the retreating 
glacier. He could smell the clean 
sweet coldness of ice and snow. 

He peered deeper into the grove. 
Was that a man’s booted foot pro- 
truding from those shadows over 
there? 

He climbed down from the mas- 
sive head and moved forward to 
investigate. Careful now — old saber- 
tooth might be around. Or Canis 
dims, the wild dog. Or the giant 
sloths, Mylodon and Megatherium, 
Perhaps even Mr. Whoolly Mam- 
moth himself.

IF 




T he foot was attached to a leg, 
the leg to a torso, the torso to 
a head. The back of the head had 
been bashed in and the brains had 
been scooped out. 

Farrell recognized the dead man 
as Professor Richards from a photo- 
graph the IPS official in charge of 
rescue operations had showed him. 
Lord! he hoped Miss Larkin, the 
professor’s secretary, hadn’t suffer- 
ed a similar fate. He explored the 
rest of the grove, but saw no sign 
of her. Maybe the mammothmobile’s 
attackers had taken her prisoner. 

He had never seen Miss Larkin m 
person, but the same IPS official 
who had showed him the photograph 
of Professor Richards had let him 
view the job-resume tape that Miss 
Larkin had filed with the Interna- 
tional Paleethnological Society’s em- 
ployment division and which had re- 
sulted in her being hired on the spot. 
The tape showed her babysitting for 
her neighbor’s children, doing house- 
work, skiing down a chaste white 
mountain slope, walking to work in 
a neat blue suitdress, typing in a 
big busy office, addressing a business 
women’s club, going to church — 
showed her, in short, engaging in 
just about every commendable acti- 
vity there was to engage in, and 
proved conclusively that she was a 
nice, clean-living red-blooded Amer- 
ican girl. On the desperate seas long 
wont to roam, Farrell had been look- 
ing for a nice clean-living red-blood- 
ed American girl all his life; conse- 
quently, the thought of losing one 
just as he was on the verge of find- 
ing her was unendurable. 

Lord! he hoped that if they had 



taken .her prisoner the Neanderthals 
hadn’t harmed her. For Neanderthals 
they were — no doubt about it. 
Granted, Cro-Magnons hunted the 
woolly mammoth too; but bashing 
in a man’s skull and devouring his 
brains was exclusively a Neander- 
thal custom. 

Presently he found impressions of 
her pointed shoe-boots among the 
grotesque tramplings of the hunting 
party’s trail. They had* taken her 
prisoner all right — though for what 
reason, he couldn’t imagine. Miss 
Larkin was stacked, and a beauty 
to boot; but a man’s taste in women 
is arbitrarily determined by the size 
and shape of the females he has 
been brought up with, and the aver- 
age Neanderthal was probably as 
susceptible to the charms of a twen- 
ty-first century American goddess as 
Farrell was to those of a she-ape. 

H e knew of course that he was 
dealing with someone besides 
Neanderthals. The Mousterian Cul- 
ture Stage had given the world fire, 
the cudgel, and the stone-tipped 
spear, but so far as he knew it had 
never come up with a weapon cap- 
able of felling a woolly mammoth- 
mobile. Unquestionably there was a 
third party on the scene, either from 
Farrell’s own time period or from a 
period beyond. In all probability 
they were responsible for Miss Lar- 
kin’s having been taken prisoner. 

Before leaving the grove, he dug a 
quick grave for Professor Richards 
and said a few words over it. Then 
he sent back news of the mishaps 
to IPS via his mammothmobile’s 
one-way time radio. Owing to the 



70 



IF 




time stream’s resistance to potenti:il 
paradoxes, three hours had been as 
close as he’d been able to get to the 
first mammothmobile’s arrival time; 
hence, assuming that he’d lost no 
time since leaving the entry-area 
and that the hunting party hadn’t 
remained very long in the grove, 
his quarry was about two hours 
ahead of him. He glanced at his 
self-adapting timepiece. 3:10 P.M. 
He ought to be able to overtake 
them easily before dark. 

One dead, one to go, he reflected 
bitterly as he drove out of the grove 
in the direction of the mountains. 
What made people like Professor 
Richards tick, anyway? Why had 
the damn fool had to come running 
back to the Upper Paleolithic just 
because he’d dug up an artifact that 
didn’t rhyme with the Aurignacian 
Culture Stage? Farrell had examined 
the artifact in question before leav- 
ing for the past, and he was willing 
to admit that neither the subject 
matter nor the quality of the work- 
manship made Aurignacian sense; 
but he still couldn’t see why a sta- 
tuette, however exquisitely it might 
be carved, was worth going 30,000 
years back in tirne to investigate. 

He supposed he shouldn’t be com- 
plaining, though. After all, if it 
weren’t for paleethnological idiots 
like Professor Richards, professional 
pastfinders like himself wouldn’t be 
working. 

n 

S pring had dressed the lower slopes 
of the distant mountains in new 
bloom, but on the summits winter 



still held ‘sway. It was as though the 
glacier in withdrawing northward 
had left part of itself behind, and 
in a sense of course it had. 

The green of the Pleistocene plat- 
eau was enlivened by sporadic pop- 
ulations of oaks, firs, chestnuts, 
beeches, and pinasters, and the Alice 
blue gown of the Cenozoic sky was 
embroidered with wispy motifs of 
scattered clouds. The “Stone Age — 
Late-Old-Middle — Excursion” pale- 
ethnologivehicle that IPS had issued 
to Farrell was a brand new one, 
and, thanks to its classification, lent 
itself nicely to the name of “Sal- 
ome”. He had already fallen in love 
with “her”. She lumbered over the 
plateau with deceptive awkwardness, 
the one-way transparency of the neo- 
alloy that constituted her “skull” af- 
fording him an almost unlimited 
view in all directions. Riding iq her 
cockpit was very much like riding 
in a howdah, except that the cockpit 
was an integral part of the convey- 
ance and rested on a bed of gyro- 
bearings that cancelled out the 
slightest lurch. 

He saw a herd of musk oxen; he 
glimpsed a pack of wild dogs. A 
giant glyptodont shuffled out of 
sight behind a stand of hardy oaks. 
A Pleistocene condor winged by 
overhead, mighty twelve-foot wings 
cupping lofty columns of spring air. 
He passed the remnants of two 
musk oxen which the hunting party 
had killed, and knew that when he 
and Salome were far enough away 
the condor would descend and dine. 
But he saw no sign of Smilodon, Old 
saber-tooth wais almost extinct in 
this day and age, having grown tusks

80 long it could no longer open its 
mouth wide enough to devour its 
prey. 

Hills appeared in the distance, 
grew closer. Salome took them in 
her stride. Cliffs were everywhere 
in evidence. 

Caves . .' “Easy now, old girl 
— we should be almost on their 

tan.” 

The trail was less distinct now, 
owing to the rockiness of the ter- 
rain, but still easy to follow. Pres- 
ently a small plain began, flanked 
on the right by a pinaster forest and 
on the left by a sparkling river. Far 
up ahead, a cliff far wider and high- 
er than any of the others Farrell had 
seen took shape. The trail pointed 
directly toward it. Hundreds of cave 
mouths pockmarked its surface, leav- 
ing little doubt that it was his quar- 
ry’s destination. By this time, they 
had already arrived. At least there 
was no sign of them on the plain. 

H e guided Salome into the pinas- 
ter forest and approached the 
escarpment behind a concealing 
fringe of outlying trees. When he 
was halfway there he saw a column 
of figures leave the sanctuary of the 
cliff and begin marching westward 
across the plain. He brought Salome 
to a halt behind a screen of conif- 
erous foliage and watched it pass. 
Having assumed that it com- 
prised another Neanderthal hunting 
party, he was astonished when it 
turned out to be made up of both 
Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons. TTie 
latter constituted the column proper 
and consisted of both men and 
women, all of them naked and un- 



armed. He estimated them to be 
about thirty in number. They 
marched two abreast, and flanking 
them on either side were about a 
dozen Neanderthals armed with 
stone-tipped spears. 

He stared after the column long 
after it had passed. There was a 
great deal he did not know about his 
prehistoric ancestors, but there was 
one thing he did know: Cro-Magnon 
hadn’t been in the habit of call- 
ing on Neanderthal, and Neander- 
thal hadn’t been in the habit of pro- 
viding Cro-Magnon with protection. 

Was it possible that the thirty 
men and women were prisoners and 
the Neanderthals were guards? 

He shelved the mystery for the 
moment and continued on his way. 
The forest grew to within a stone’s 
throw of the southern flank of the 
escarpment. He halted Salome in a 
well of late-afternoon shadows and, 
breaking out a chicken ’n biskit 
vacuumpac and a vacuumjug of cof- 
fee, surveyed the base of the cliff 
while he dined. 

All along it, cook-fires burned, 
tended by hirsute women appareled 
in shaggy animal skins. Squat and 
hairy men were cutting chunks and 
strips of meat from the musk-ox 
quarters the hunting party had 
brought in. Dirty children were 
dashing here and there, getting in 
everyone’s way and making general 
nuisances of themselves. The scene 
was highlighted by late-afternoon 
sunlight, darkened by shadows creep- 
ing in from the plain; softened by 
a strange haziness which Farrell at- 
tributed to the smoke rising from 
the fires.

IF 




He saw no si^ of Miss Larkin. 
No doubt she had been consigned to 
one of the caves — either that, or she 
was lying bound somewhere, and 
blended with her background. There 
was yet another possibility, but he 
didn’t care to consider it. As long 
as there was no evidence to the 
contrary, he would continue to be- 
lieve she was still alive. 

T he Cenozoic sun descended be- 
hind distant hills and trees and 
the eastern sky adorned itself with 
the twinkling earrings of night. Far- 
rell had two courses of action: he 
could approach the cliff openly in 
Salome or leave her behind in the 
forest and effect Miss Larkin’s res- 
cue through stealth alone. After due 
deliberation, he chose course num- 
ber two, not because he preferred it 
but because he knew that the sight 
of Salome would send the cave men 
scurrying into their caves from the 
safety of which they would loose 
their spears, and if Miss Larkin were 
in the open she might be hit, and if 
she weren’t he’d never be able to 
find her, or get to her if he did. 

He backed Salome deeper into the 
woods and psyche-programmed her 
to withdraw the Jacob’s ladderette 
after he reached the ground and to 
reclose her ear-hatch. Then he typed 
GRANITE OUTCROPPING on her 
lumillusion panel and turned the 
dial to On. Night had completely 
supplanted day when at last he crept 
from the forest and began making 
his way toward the cliff, and all the 
stars were out. Fortunately, there 
was no moon. 

He expected to smell the caves, 



but he didn’t. Nor did he smell the 
smoke from the dwindling cook-fires. 
He was on his hands and knees now, 
creeping through tall coarse grass. 
Suddenly his head collided with an 
invisible barrier. When he reached 
out and touched it, his fingers came 
away tingling. 

A force-field yet! 

He shouldn’t have been surprised, 
he supposed. Nevertheless, he was. 
Getting cautiously to his feet, he ex- 
plored the invisible barrier further. 
It rose to a height higher than he 
could reach and appeared to extend 
in a semi-circle from the southern- 
most section of the cliff to the 
northernmost. Back on his hands and 
knees again, he began creeping along 
the base of the barrier. Presently, to 
his relief, he saw Miss Larkin. She 
was lying bound hand and foot near 
one of the cook-fires, and appeared 
to be unharmed 

Making himself as comfortable as 
possible in the tall grass, he with- 
drew a numb-gun cartridge from his 
ammo belt, removed the tiny ampli- 
fier, and emptied the electro-crystals 
into the palm of his hand. After 
emptying six more cartridges in a 
similar manner, he dumped the little 
pile of crystals into his handkerchief 
and tied the ends together. The 
ground was still damp from a recent 
rain — damp enough, at least, for his 
purpose. Digging a small hole, he 
placed the makeshift sack inside and 
covered it. 

B y this time, the evening meal had 
come to an end, and the cave 
men and women were retiring to 
their rocky bowers. He was afraid 



ORIGIN OF SPECIES 



73 




for a while that Miss Larkin would 
be dragged into one of the caves, but 
she wasn’t. Her captors left her lying 
by the fire, guard^ by one of their 
number — a bristly fellow with a face 
that looked as though it had been 
stomped by a musk ox. Stupefied by 
the enormous amount of half cooked 
meat he had devoured, the fellow 
was already beginning to nod, and 
presently his head dropped forward 
onto his craggy knees, which he had 
drawn up against his chest, fetus- 
fashion. 

Farrell waited till he was reason- 
ably certain that the other members 
of the tribe — and whatever non- 
members who happened to be on the 
scene — were fast asleep; then he dug 
up his homemade piezoelectric cock- 
tail and tossed it against the force- 
field. TTiere was a brief blue spark, 
an almost inaudible sputter, and a 
faint odor of ozone. So much for 
the force-field. 

He crawled past the site of the 
vanished barrier on elbows and 
thighs. He could smell the caves 
now. And how he could! The girl 
was wide awake. When she saw him 
creep into the fading firelight, her 
eyes went wide. “Go back — go 
back!” she whispered hoarsely. 
“They left me here to lure you — 
don’t you see?” 

He saw only that her eyes were 
blue and that her sun-tanned face 
was like an angel’s. Truly, it had 
never fallen to a man to rescue a 
fairer damsel in distress. He cut the 
gut-thongs that bound her wrists and 
ankles, and when her dark and lus- 
trous hair brushed his cheek as he 
raised her to her feet. 



Loss of circulation caused her to 
stagger, and he picked her up. “You 
idiot!’* she said. And then, “Run for 
it — maybe there’s time!” 

There wasn’t, though. Three out- 
size Neanderthals came out of the 
shadows just as Farrell was about 
to take off for the forest. One of 
them wore a saber-tooth tigerskin 
and was clearly the leader. He had a 
mouth like a bear trap, and as Far- 
rel stared he opened it and out of 
it came a blue bolt that knocked 
Farrell silly and sent him sagging to 
the ground. Miss Larkin on top of 
him. 

Ill 

TT^hile Miss Larkin was anything 
^ ^ but slight, she was far from 
being an unbearable burden. It 
was Farrell’s head that was the un- 
bearable burden. It felt twice its nor- 
mal size and thrice its normal 
weight, and he could barely hold it 
high enough to view his three ad- 
versaries. 

The one who had unleashed the 
blue bolt stooped down and relieved 
him of his numb-gun, his ammo belt 
his timepiece, his pocket torch, and 
his hunting knife; then he proceeded 
to examine each object in turn in the 
firelight. His eyes were large and 
strangely flat, and held not the faint- 
est glimmer of intelligence or any- 
thing else. At length he emitted sev- 
eral monosyllabic grunts, and one of 
his companions jerked the girl to her 
feet. The other one jerked Farrell 
to his, and he and Miss Larkin were 
hustled over to the mouth of a near- 
by cave and shoved inside. 



74 



IF 




When his legs went out from un- 
der him, Farrell thought at first that 
it was the result of the shock-charge 
he’d absorbed. It wasn’t, though. It 
was the result of the twelve-foot dis- 
crepancy that existed between the 
level of the ground and the level of 
the cave floor. The fall netted him a 
bruised ear and a skinned elbow, 
and cost him a lungful of air when 
Miss Larkin landed on top of him. 

She bounced off his back like a 
rubber ball. As soon as he got his 
breath back, he felt around for her 
in the inky darkness. “Ooh!” Miss 
Larkin said. 

He jerked his hand away. “I’m 
sorry — I didn’t mean to be fresh. 
Are you all right, Miss Larkin?” 
There was a brief silence, during 
which he received the definite im- 
pression that she was adding up the 
little she knew about him thus far in 
an attempt to arrive at some kind of 
a conclusion. Presently, “I — ^I guess 
so,” she said. “Are you?” 

“I’ll be all right. My name’s Alan 
Farrell — IPS sent me back for you 
and Professor Richards when you 
didn’t report in.” 

“It was noble of you to try to 
rescue me, Mr. Farrell. I’m — I’m 
sorry I called you an idiot.” 

“Now, now. Miss Larkin — I’m a 
professional pastfinder. It’s my job 
to rescue people.” The words sound- 
ed corny even to him and he had a 
hunch he’d heard them before — 
probably on 3V. “In a moment I’ll 
see about getting you out of here 
and back to the present,” he went 
on, “but first, we’d better bring each 
other up to date. You said when you 
first saw me that you’d been left out 



in the open to lure me. That means 
Blue Bolt and his buddies knew I 
was coming. How did they know/” 
“I don’t think they did know for 
sure,” Miss Larkin said. “Probably 
they guessed that my disappearance 
would be investigated.” Her voice 
caught a little. “I— I guess you know 
about poor Professor Richards.” 

F arrell wanted to find her hand 
in the darkness and give it a re- 
assuring squeeze, but remembering 
his faux pas of a moment ago, he 
decided not to do any more fum- 
bling around in the dark. “I gave 
him a decent burial. Miss Larkin — 
it was all I could do.” 

Miss Larkin sighed. “He was such 
a dear sweet old man. Twenty of 
those terrible creatures attacked our 
mammothmobile and that horrid one 
in the tigerskin burned a hole right 
through it with that same bllie bolt 
he hit you with, only a thousand 
times stronger. They grabbed Pro- 
fessor Larkin first and then they 
grabbed me. I — ^I thought they were 
going to do the same thing to me 
that they did to him, and they would 
have, too, if Blue Bolt and those two 
others hadn’t stopped them. They ’'re 
the leaders, I think, only Blue Bolt 
has the most to say. Are they from 
the future, do you think, Mr. Par- 
rel?” 

“They must be. Thieves, probably, 
who looked enough like Neander- 
thals to begin with to pass them- 
selves off as the real thing with the 
help of a little perma-makc-up. I 
can’t imagine, though, what they ex- 
pect to steal in this time period. 
Maybe they’re from our future. That

75 




would explain the oral energy 
beam.” Farrell got to his feet. “Well 
Miss Larkin, we’re wasting time. I 
said I’d get you out of here, and 
I will.” 

“Mr. Farrell, I’m glad you showed 
up. You’re the answer to a lonely 
girl’s prayer.” 

It made him feel big and strong 
to know that she trusted him im- 
plicity, and the feeling of tenderness 
which she had already evoked m 
him became more profound. He be- 
gan exploring the cave, working his 
way along the walls with only his 
fingers to guide him. His head was 
still heavy from the effects of Blue 
Bolt’s blue bolt, but no permanent 
damage had been done, and after a 
while the heaviness went away. 

The cave proved to be a natural 
dungeon, circular in shape and some 
fifteen feet in diameter. He went 
over every inch of the vertical walls, 
or at least every inch within reach- 
ing distance, and finally he found 
what he was searching for — a crev- 
ice. As the cliff was honeycombed 
with caves — its pockmarked facade 
would admit of no other conclu- 
sion — any crevice could very well in- 
dicate the presence of a thin parti- 
tion. 

T his one was wide enough at one 
point for him to work his arm 
into. Less than a foot beyond the 
wall, the fissure spread outward, and 
his groping hand encountered noth- 
ingness. He was certain that it 
spelled an adjacent cave and equal- 
ly as certain that he could work his 
way through. “Miss Larkin,” he 
whispered, “give me a hand, will 



you? I think I’ve found a way out 
of here.” 

She joined him, and together they 
began widening the crevice. The 
rock was loose for the most part, 
but working it free was slow work 
and the need to proceed quietly 
made the job even slower. He be- 
came consciously aware of Miss 
Larkin’s perfume. He’d been uncon- 
sciously aware of it all along. It was 
the evocative-association type, and 
all the while he worked he kept see- 
ing apple orchards in springtime 
bloom, and meadows clad with but- 
tercups and daisies. Lord! It was 
wonderful being with a nice girl for 
a change. He’d never frequent an- 
other ecdysiast dive or another 
Easter Rabbit Club as long as he 
lived! 

Hours passed. They rested now 
and then, sitting side by side in the 
darkness. Faint drafts of fresh air 
wafted sporadically through the 
opening they were working on, prov- 
ing that whatever else it might be, 
the cave beyond wasn’t a dead end. 
Finally — Ion? after midnight, Farrell 
estimated — the aperture was wide 
enough for them to crawl through. 
“FIl go first. Miss Larkin,” he said. 
“In the interest of safety. When I 
give the word, you follow.” 

The cave into which he presently 
crawled was a disappointment. In 
fact, it brought to mind an outsize 
burrow more than it did a cave. At 
best, it could be classified as a nar- 
row tunnel. But it was better than 
nothing. “All right. Miss Larkin,” he 
said over his shoulder. “Keep just 
behind me.” 

As nearly as he could determine, 



76 



IF 




the tunnel ran parallel to the face of 
the cliff. As the faint drafts of fresh 
air seemed to be coming from the 
left, he set out in that direction, 
crawling on his hands and knees. 
Miss Larkin just behind him. For an 
interminable time, conditions did 
not improve. The tunnel grew nar- 
rower, if anything, and turned first 
this way and then that. Farrell began 
to be worried. *Tf this keeps up,” 
Miss Larkin said cheerfully, “I 
shan’t have to go on a diet for at 
least another year.” 

Fortunately, it didn’t keep up. The 
tunnel, after slanting sharply upward 
for several dozen feet, grew sudden- 
ly wider, and Farrell found he could 
stand upright. Miss Larkin stood up 
beside him. *T — I think we’d better 
hold hands,” he said. “There may be 
drop-offs.” 

It was her hand that found his. 
He gripped it tightly. Oh, how he 
yearned to tell her how wonderful 
it was to be with her — how sick he 
was of ecdysiast dives and Easter 
Rabbit Clubs; of girls who thought 
no more of taking off their clothes 
than they did about smoking a ciga- 
rette. But he held himself in check. 
She probably didn’t even know there 
were such girls. 

The tunnel continued to turn this 
way and that. They felt their way 
slowly along its walls. Farrell had a 
hunch they were in a labyrinth rath- 
er than in a single tunnel, but he 
didn’t say so. There was no point in 
alarming Miss Larkin, and anyway, 
the drafts of fresh air he had pinned 
their hopes upon continued to fan 
his face. 

Presently the tunnel — whether it 



was the original one or not, he had 
no way of knowing — narrowed and 
took on an upward pitch. It wasn’>t 
long before he and the girl were 
crawling again. “I — I think the 
ground’s trembling,” Miss Larkin 
said after they had proceeded for 
about a hundred feet. “May^ — maybe 
we should go back.” 

IV 

F arrell felt the trembling himself. 

A moment later he heard a 
faint humming sound which he 
recognized as the muffled throbbing 
of a powerful generator. Clearly, the 
cliff housed more than a Neander- 
thal community — an eventuality for 
which the presence of the force-field 
should have prepared him. 

“It’s all right, Miss Larkin,” he 
said over his shoulder. “We’re on 
the right track. We should be out 
of here in no time.” 

He wormed his way around a 
bend, discovered that he could dim- 
ly make out the walls of the tunnel. 
After worming his way around two 
more, he saw, far up ahead, an un- 
even circle of wan light. “Chin up, 
Miss Larkin,” he whispered. “We’re 
almost there.” 

He slowed his pace as he neared 
the opening and cautioned her to 
move as silently as she could. The 
humming sound was much louder 
now, the trembling of the ground 
more pronounced. At length he 
crawled out onto a wide ledge that 
looked down into a mammoth semi- 
natural cavern, one whole wall of 
which was given over to a huge 
gleaming machine. 



ORIGIN OF SPECIES 



77 




Miss Larkin crawled out on the 
ledge beside him. There was a 
smudge of dirt on her right cheek, 
her dark hair hung in damp wisps 
over her forehead, her khaki blouse 
was torn in several places, and her 
once immaculate culottes were a 
mess. But her eyes were no less 
heavenly than they had been before 
and her face still had the aspect of 
an angel’s. Farrell was more cer- 
tain than ever that she was the Girl 
for Him. 

She gasped when she peered be- 
low. Farrell had already taken in 
the scene. The machine consisted of 
multicolored banks of computers, 
glowing mazes of coils, and weird 
complexities of gleaming wires. At 
the base of the wall opposite the 
ledge was the source of the hum- 
ming sound — a giant generator. As 
nearly as he could ascertain, it was 
powered by gasoline, distilled prob- 
ably by Blue Bolt & Co. from a lo- 
cal petroleum deposit. Illumination 
was provided by a battery of super- 
fluoros suspended some twenty feet 
below the stalactitic ceiling (and 
some ten feet below the ledge) and 
aligned in such a way that their rad- 
iance bathed the machine and its im- 
mediate foreground in unadulterated 
brightness, leaving the rest of the 
huge chamber in relative darkness. 
In the wall opposite the machine a 
wide archway gave access to a nat- 
ural corridor that led, if the fresh- 
ness of the air was a dependable in- 
dex, to the outside world. 

T here were fifteen Neanderthals 
present. Three of them were 
Neanderthaloids — ^i.e., Blue Bolt and 



his buddies. The rest were of the 
ordinary garden variety. The latter 
were armed with stone-tipped spears 
which they carried slung on their 
shoulders, and were lounging here 
and there about the room. The for- 
mer were facing a twinkling control 
panel at the base of the machine. 
Inset in a maze of wires next to the 
panel was what looked at first glance 
like a full-length looking glass. The 
trouble was, it didn’t reflect light; in- 
stead, it absorbed it — or seemed to. 
The result was a sort of abysmal 
blackness that transcended ordinary 
blackness and gave the viewer a 
queasy feeling. 

It dawned on Farrell finally that 
the looking glass was the focal point 
of the entire machine — the raison 
d'etre for the whole fantastic scene 
they witnessed. 

“Look,” Miss Larkin said, point- 
ing. “There’s a way we can get 
down.” 

Sure enough, the edge of the ledge 
nearest the exit gave onto a series 
of stone steps that had been cut in- 
to the cavern wall. The crude stair- 
way curved down to a point on the 
cavern floor that was less than ten 
feet from the archway, and, dimly 
lit as the wall was, would have made 
an ideal avenue, of escape if it hadn’t 
been for the three Neanderthals 
lounging near the exit and for the 
force-field which awaited beyond the 
cliff-face. (There was no question in 
Farrell’s mind that by this time the 
barrier had been repaired.) 

“Do you know what I think?” 
Miss Larkin said brightly. “I think 
that this was once a ceremonial 
chamber of some kind. It was prac-

tically on this very spot that Pro- 
fessor Richards dug up the Chateau 
du Bois artifact.” Abruptly she 
frowned. “But that doesn’t add up 
at all, does it? The experts estimated 
that the artifact originated sometime 
this year, which means that it 
couldn’t possibly have played a part 
in the past ceremonies. Anyway,” 
she went on blithely, “this still could 
have been a ceremonial chamber and 
Blue Bolt could have converted it for 
his own purposes, and this ledge 
here could have been where the 
witch doctor presided over the sac- 
rifices, and that passage we came 
through could have been his secret 
hideout.” 

F arrell looked at her. She didn’t 
sound as though she knew 
beans about paleethnology. But then, 
you had to remember that she wasn’t 
a paleethnologist. Still and all, 
though, as a secretary for IPS she 
ought to have learned something. 
But he was being unfair. “I think 
you’re right. Miss Larkin,” he said 
loyally. “One hundred per cent right. 
Gosh,” he went on, unable any 
longer to hold himself in check, “it’s 
wonderful talking to a girl like you 
for a change. I saw your job-resume 
tape and knew what a warm and 
wonderful girl you were even before 
I came back to rescue yon; but gosh, 
I didn’t realize you were this warm 
and wonderful.” 

She blushed the way a pretty girl 
should. “Now you’ve gone and put 
me on a pedestal, Mr. Farrell. You 
shouldn’t do that to a girl, you know, 
unless you’re willing to pick up the 
pieces after she falls off and put 



them back together again.” For 
some reason she seemed eager to 
change the subject. “Did IPS equip 
yon with a palee — palee — with a 
means of transportation?” she asked. 

He nodded. “A woolly mammoth- 
mobile. She’s hidden in the woods 
about a hundred yards from the cliff, 
lumillusioned to look like a granite 
outcropping. If we can get to her, 
we’ll be all set. Trouble is, how Jo 
we do it?” 

He returned his gaze to the scene 
below. It had changed somewhat 
since his last surveillance. Blue Bolt 
was stabbing home buttons on the 
control panel and the two other 
Neanderthaloids had stationed them- 
selves on either side of the looking 
glass. The ordinary garden variety 
had unslung their spears and formed 
a staggered aisle between the looking 
glass and the archway. It was clear 
from their determined mien that 
they meant business. 

“It looks like some kind of a re- 
ception committee,” Miss Larkin ob- 
served. 

And in essence, that was what it 
turned out to be. Farrell couldn’t be- 
lieve his eyes when he saw the first 
Cro-Magnon step out of the looking 
glass. But they must have told him 
the truth, because presently a second 
one emerged from the blackness and 
stood beside the first. They were tall 
and tanned, and wore neither cloth- 
ing nor ornaments. The brightness 
of the radiance in which they stood 
gave their faces a distinctness that 
carried all the way to the ledge. Far- 
rell suffered a second shock. The 
faces were typically Cro-Magnon — 
strong of chin, aquiline of nose, and 



ORIGIN OF SPECIES 



79 





deep set of eyes — but they were 
overcast, disfigured almost, by ex- 
pressions of evil that were almost 
tangible. 

Were these his ancestors? 

O ne of the two Neanderthal oids 
stationed beside the looking 
glass made a gesture with his left 
arm and the two Cro-Magnons 
walked down the aisle of Neander- 
thals and halted several feet from 
the exit. Two more stepped out of the 
looking glass — a man and a woman, 
this time, and no less malignant of 
countenance than their two prede- 
cessors — and the process was re- 
peated. Farrell realized then that he 
was witnessing the forming of a 
column similar to the one he had 
seen the previous afternoon. He also 
realized something else. “Why,” he 



gasped, “the machine’s a matter 
transmitter! We’re watching a mi- 
gration from another planet!” 

Miss Larkin’s blue eyes were 
round. “But why another planet, Mr. 
Farrell? Couldn’t they be migrating 
from a different part of this one?” 
“But this is where Cro-Magnon 
originated, Miss Larkin.” Didn’t she 
know anything about paleethnology? 
“This is where he spread out from. 
It all adds up, don’t you see? His 
sudden appearance on the prehistoric 
scene. His marked difference from 
any of the other races. Everything.” 
“Well it doesn’t add up to me,” 
Miss Larkin said. “If they’re from 
another planet. Blue Bolt and those 
other two creeps must be from the 
same one. So why don’t they look 
like each other?” 

“Probably because they’re repre- 



IF 



80 






sentatives of two different races. 
And then, too, Blue Bolt and his 
two friends probably made a few 
changes in their appearance in order 
to pass themselves off as Neander- 
thals. Either before or after they 
were deposited on Earth to build the 
receiving end of the matter trans- 
mitter. They needed help, and what 
better way was there for them to get 
it than by ingratiating themselves 
with d local tribe of cave men by 
promising them safety and a con- 
stant supply of fresh meat. It takes 
man power as well as brains to es- 
tablish a penal colony.” 

“A penal colony? You mean the 
Cro-Magnons are prisoners?” 

“It certainly looks that way. Vic- 
ious criminals, if the expressions on 
their faces mean anything. Once 
they’re escorted out of the imme- 



diate vicinity they’re probably turned 
loose to shift for themselves, but to 
all intents and purposes. Earth to 
them is a planetary Devil’s Island. 
That transmitter has probably been 
operating for months.” 

They watched as more Cro-Mag- 
nons emerged from the “looking 
glass”. There were as many women 
as there were men, and all of them 
— ^men and women alike — ^looked as 
though they’d murder their best 
friend at the drop of a hat. At length 
the column was complete — Farrell 
estimated its number to be about 
thirty — and the Neanderthal guards 
escorted it from the chamber. 

Abruptly he realized that there 
were no guards at the rear. 

That was when the idea hit him. 
Right between the eyes. 

Could Neanderthals count?

Would Miss Farrell, if circum- 
stances demanded it, consent to tak- 
ing off her clothes? 

She was going to have to take 
them off, nice girl or no nice girl. 
Otherwise his plan wouldn’t work. 
And he was going to have to take 
his off, too. 

He^ hoped that she was tanned 
all over. 

V 

B lushing, he told her what he had 
in mind and the supreme sac- 
rifice it would entail. She blinked 
once; then her right hand strayed 
absently to the zipper of her blouse. 
“No, no — not yet. Miss Larkin!” 
he gasped. “Wait until the next col- 
umn’s almost formed.” 

While it was forming he concen- 
trated on the machine. He didn’t 
know whether he could psyche-pro- 
gram the computers or not, nor did 
he knew whether the time stream in 
this instance would brook interfer- 
ence. But he did know that at one 
time or another someone had thrown 
a monkey wrench in the works, be- 
cause in a planetary sense only a 
few Cro-Magnon prisoners had come 
through. That someone could very 
well have been himself. 

First of all, he had to devise a 
time-unit. The amount of time con- 
sumed in forming a column would 
do. He visualized eight such opera- 
tions; then he visualized an over- 
load building up in the step-down 
transformer and spilling through 
the transmitter proper. Finally he 
pictured the transmitter bursting into 
flame, the coils disintegratiDg, and 



the computers belching black smoke. 
In effect, he instructed the machine 
to commit suicide some three hours 
in the future. 

By this time the second column 
was two-thirds formed. Miss Larkin 
was fingering the zipper of her 
blouse. If he hadn’t known better, 
he’d have sworn she was eager to 
take her clothes off. “Now?” she 

He nodded. “Now.” 

The ledge was wide enough for 
her to stand upright without being 
seen from below, and deep enough 
in shadow so that she probably 
couldn’t have been seen in any case. 
After getting to her feet, she unzip- 
ped her blouse and slipped it slowly 
from her shoulders, gently rotating 
her hips as though in response to 
music only she could hear. Farrell 
stared. 

The blouse floated down to 
the ledge, forming a little khaki hill. 
Her eyes were half closed by now, 
and there was a dreamy expression 
on her face. She moved a step to the 
right and a step to the left and 
kicked off her shoes. Her culottes 
were the next to go. Farrell tried to 
turn his eyes away, but for the life 
of him he couldn’t. Off came her 
brassiere. She tossed it into the air 
and he caught it just in time to keep 
it from drifting down into the cham- 
ber below. Her hips were moving 
rhythmically now and the upper part 
of her body was turning first to 
the left and then to the right. Poor 
Farrell sagged down on the ledge. 
He felt like a fool. 

Well anyway, she was tanned all 
over . 



82 



IF 




S o was he. He picked up his dis- 
carded clothes and hers too and 
tossed them back into the tunnel. 
Miss Larkin, eyes completely closed 
now, was still doing the bump and 
grind. She did it well, this chaste 
young damsel in distress — and how 
she did! He knew professional fin- 
esse when he saw it. He cleared his 
throat. “I hate to interrupt you. Miss 
Larkin,” he said icily, ‘'but the col- 
umn’s nearly formed and we’d better 
be on our way.” 

She gave a little jump and opened 
her eyes. She seemed surprised to 
see him standing there, and she 
looked around the cavern as though 
she’d forgotten where she was. Then 
she looked at him again, and blush- 
ed. ‘Tm — I’m ready, Mr. Farrell.” 
He led the way, moving slowly 
and telling her to do likewise. They 
were almost itwisible agahist the 
cavern wall, but any sudden move- 
ment might betray them. Farrell 
kept a watchful eye on both the 
Neanderthals and the Cro-Magnons, 
but the former were completely pre- 
occupied with their guard duties and 
the latter kept their eyes straight 
ahead. As for Blue Bolt & Co., they 
had eyes only for the machine. 

When Farrell and the girl reached 
the floor of the chamber, the col- 
umn was already moving out. They 
waited till the last second; then, 
when the backs of the Neanderthal 
guards were turned, they slipped 
swiftly into line. 

So far, so good. 

Roomy to begin with, the corridor 
had been enlarged in many places 
to give it uniform height and width. 
Wan and fitful light was supplied by 



torches inset in the walls. Drafts of 
fresh cold air sent the flames to 
flickering every now and then and 
caused shadows to dance upon the 
walls. The Cro-Magnons spoke spor- 
adically to one another in a language 
that was millennia dead. Neither 
they nor the Neanderthal guards 
were aware that the column was 
slightly longer than it was supposed 
to be. 

“That was a dilly of a dance you 
did back there,” Farrell said out of 
the side of his mouth. 

Miss Larkin kept her gaze straight 
ahead. “I — I gave myself away, 
didn’t I?” 

“You sure did,” Farrell said. 
“What ecdysiast dive did you strip 
in before you turned over a new 
leaf?” 

“Big Bust Anna’s in Old York. 
I can have my old job back any 
time I want.” 

“What I can’t figure,” Farrell said, 
“is why you quit it in the first 
place.” 

“A girl gets sick of — of certain 
things. And you needn’t sound so 
pained. I told you you shouldn’t put 
a girl on a pedestal unless you were 
willing to pick up the pieces when 
she fell off.” 

“Another thing I can’t figure,” 
Farrell said, “is what prompted you 
to give a professional performance 
just because I asked you to take 
your clothes off.” 

“Be — before I went to work at 
Big Anna’s I used to practice nights 
in my room. I practiced so much 
that taking off my clothes and doing 
a professional strip-tease became one 
and the same thing, and now I can’t

dp one without doing the other, it’s 
such a habit. I — I wasn’t even 
aware of what 1 was doing back on 
the ledge.” 

T he column was rounding a bend. 

In the distance, dawnlight show- 
ed. “Still another thing I can’t fig- 
ure,” Farrell said, “is how you faked 
that job-resume tape.” 

“\^at world are you living in, 
Mr, Farrell? That sort of thing is 
done everyday. Almost any job 
agency will fix you up if you give 
them a big enough bribe.” 

“That was a real dill of a shot 
of you skiing down that mountain 
slope. All that clean chaste snow!” 
“The trouble with you, Mr. Far- 
rell, is you’re a self-righteous pedes- 
tal pusher. I’m sorry to have to say 
such a mean thing after you risked 
your life to save mine and every- 
thing, but it’s true. Do- you know 
why Big Bust Anna and people like 
her drive Cadillettes? It’s because 
men like you make them rich. You 
don’t really like the girls you keep 
putting on pedestals — you just think 
you do. You keep wishing they’d 
fall off so you could have some fun, 
and when they don’t you head for 
the nearest ecdysiast bar and make 
passes at some poor girl like me 
who’s trying to make a living in the 
only way she knows how. It’s be- 
cause of men like you that I made 
up my mind to become a secretary 
even if I had to lie to do it.” 

“I figured you’d get around to 
blaming me,” Farrell said. 

By this time the column was 
emerging into the light of early 
morning. Squatting by the cave 



mouth was a Neanderthal woman 
with an earthen bowl resting on her 
lap. Beside her was a large pile of 
pebbles and every time a pair of 
Cro-Magnons passed she dropped 
two pebbles into the bowl. It was 
what Farrell had been afraid of. 
Undoubtedly the transmitter was 
equipped with an automatic counter 
and in all probability the woman’s 
job was nothing more than a sine- 
cure; nevertheless, if each batch of 
prisoners was numerically the same 
she might notice a discrepancy. 

He watched her out of the corner 
of his eye as he and Miss Larkin 
came out of the cave. She picked up 
two more pebbles, started to drop 
them into the bowl — and paused. 
She stared at Farrell and Miss Lar- 
kin as though she didn’t believe they 
were really there; then, apparently 
concluding that they must be, she 
added the two pebbles to the others. 
Farrell exhaled a sigh of relief. 

A brisk wind was blowing down 
from the glacier. He realized how 
cold he was, and glancing sideways 
at Miss Larkin, he saw that she was 
covered with goose flesh. The Cro- 
Magnons, though, didn’t seem to be 
in the least affected. They were 
lean and hard-bitten, both men and 
women. Probably they had been pri- 
soners for some time and were used 
to physical discomfort. He wondered 
how high on the ladder of civiliza- 
tion their race had climbed. A stag- 
gering incongruity existed between 
the weapons they would invent and 
the matter transmitter that had trans- 
ported them through space; but then, 
as criminals they probably weren’t 
particularly conversant with the 



84 



IF 




technical miracles of their age. With- 
out tools to work with there would 
be little they could accomplish in 
any case. They were doomed to be- 
come what in one sense they had 
become already — Stone Age sav- 
ages, far more capable and resource- 
ful than the savages who had come 
before them, but not a great deal 
higher on the evolutionary ladder. 

I t chilled him to think that modern 
man had descended from crea- 
tures such as they, but it didn’t sur- 
prise him. He was glad that he’d 
tried at least to knock out the trans- 
mitter and bring the sordid practice 
to an end. And who knew — per- 
haps he’d succeeded. 

The force-field had been tempor- 
arily deactivated and the column was 
now filing out onto the plain. The 
pinaster forest was temptingly close. 
In a few moments now he and Miss 
Larkin would be abreast of the spot 
where Salome was hidden. “Get 
ready,” he whispered. “When I say 
‘now’, start running for the woods.” 
She nodded to show that she un- 
derstood. 

He was certain that they could 
easily outdistance the awkward Ne- 
anderthals and anticipated no diffi- 
culty in evading their spears, which 
were not primarily throwing wea- 
pons anyway. But the problem didn’t 
prove to be quite that simple. He 
guessed what had happened when 
he heard a shout from behind and 
turned and saw Blue Bolt and his 
two confederates pounding toward 
the column: the pebble woman, driv- 
en by her suspicions, had turned her 
pebble in and the discrepancy had 



been discovered. A glance into the 
empty cave-dungeon had been 
enough to inform Blue Bolt who the 
two extra “Cro-Magnons” were. 

“Now!” Farrell said, and seized 
Miss Larkin’s hand, bowled over 
the nearest Neanderthal with a shoul- 
der butt, and began running toward 
the forest. 

Blue Bolt waved the guards back 
and gave pursuit with his two bud- 
dies. 

Farrell was astonished at the 
trio’s speed. They moved so fast, 
their legs were mere blurs. Abruptly 
a blue bolt shot out of Blue Bolt’s 
mouth. 

It missed by a mile, but its 
intensity left no doubt that he was 
all through taking prisoners. 

Farrell upped his speed, forced 
Miss Larkin to do likewise by pull- 
ing her along beside him. Only their 
head start enabled them to reach 
Salome in time. He had to cancel out 
her lumillusion field to find her ear- 
hatch. 

After psyching it open and 
psyching down the ladder, he and 
Miss Larkin clambered into the 
cockpit and he closed and secured 
the hatch. 

Blue Bolt & Co. were less than 
twenty yards away now, streaking 
toward the woolly mammothmobile 
on blurred legs. Blue Bolt had his 
mouth open again. At such close 
range, he couldn’t possibly miss, and 
Salome’s shield-field hadn’t been 
made to withstand such a weapon. 
There was only one thing to do, and 
Farrell did it: he time-jumped the 
massive paleethnologivehicle into the 
future.

VI 

A fter the usual interval of gray- 
ness and the usual lurch, the 
forest came into view again, and, 
through its coniferous foliage, the 
plain and the cliff. Farrell had tried 
for one hour, and the position of 
the sun to d him he’d obtained it. 
Apparently there were no potential 
paradoxes in the immediate future. 

The plain was empty of both Cro- 
Magnons and Neanderthals. Blue 
Bolt and his buddies were no more. 

Farrell retired to the cabin, got 
into a spare pair of self-fitting fati- 
gues, and threw a similar pair up 
to Miss Larkin. By the time he 
crawled back into the cockpit carry- 
ing two pairs of sock-shoes, she was 
decent again. 

Sitting in the two bucket seats, 
they slipped their feet into the shoes. 
“Now,” said Farrell, “if they haven’t 
set up an ambush, we’ve got it made. 
We’ll — ” 

He paused, staring. Where a mo- 
ment ago thin air had been. Blue 
Bolt and his buddies stood. Blue 
Bolt had his mouth open. 

Farrell punched out another hour 
on the automatic retro-co-ordinate 
calculator. There was a second gray 
interval, a second slight lurch; then 
the forest and the plain and the cliff 
again, illumined by a sun still higher 
in the morning sky. **They can time- 
jump too!” he gasped. ‘^Vorse, 
they’ve got a fix on us.” 

He threw Salome into gear, sent 
her charging straight ahead for thir- 
ty yards, halted her and turned her 
around. Then he aligned the trunk- 
cannon and waited. A minute passed. 



Two. At length three tenuous forms 
took shape, solidified into Blue Bolt 
& Co. But this time the trio’s backs 
were turned. It was kill or bo killed. 
Farrell dispatched three shells just 
as the Neanderthaloids turned 
around. All of them fdund their 
mark. Plugg! Plugg! Plugg! they 
went, and fhree ragged holes ap- 
peared in three hairy chests. 

B ut for some reason, the Neander- 
thaloids didn’t go down. In- 
stead, they remained standing where 
they were. Like statues. Presently 
smoke began pouring out of their 
mouths. Their noses. Their ears. 
And then, as Farrell and Miss Lar- 
kin stared, a little hatch opened in 
the side of Blue Bolt’s head, a little 
foil ladder came down, and two tiny 
stick-men emerged and descended to 
the ground. They set out frantically 
in the direction of the cliff and a 
moment later they disappeared into 
the tall plain-grass. 

Less than a second later, hatches 
opened in the sides of Blue Bolt’s 
buddies’ heads, and four more tiny 
stick-men took off for the cliff. 

“Well I’ll be damned!” Farrell said. 
“Here all the while we thought we 
were dealing with Cro-Magnon’s fel- 
low men and we were dealing with 
Lilliputian aliens riding around jn 
paleethnologivehicles. This is a ga- 
lactic operation — not a local one. 
I’ll bet a Girl Scout cookie those 
stickmen are members of a galactic 
police force!” 

Miss Larkin’s angelic face was 
pink with excitement. “They’re more 
than that, Mr. Farrell. They’re dead 
ringers for that artifact Professor 



86 



IF 




Richards dug up. It’s stone, I know, 
but just the same I’ll bet^ it’s one of 
them. Somehow they looked like 
they were made of some kind of 
stone to me. Could they be?” 

He nodded. “Probably not stone 
exactly, but a combination of ele- 
ments that could become stone over 
a period of 30,000 years. Beyond a 
doubt, they’re silica-based lifeforms. 
And those vehicles of theirs were 
more than mere vehicles — they 
were spacesuits, too. Special-built 
LEMs for Earth use. They probably 
can’t live in an atmosphere like this 
one for more than a quarter of an 
hour.” 

“Let’s try to find them,” Miss 
Larkin said. 

“We’d be wasting our time. 
They’ve probably reached the mat- 
ter transmitter by this time and — ” 

He paused. A chorus of terrified 
screams had reached his ears, and 
looking toward the cliff, he saw 
black smoke and frantic Neander- 
thals issuing from the caves. The 
monkey wrench he had thrown in 
the works had borne fruit: the trans- 
mitter had responded to his psyche- 
programming and committed suicide. 

He explained to Miss Larkin what 
had happened. “I don’t know wheth- 
er they built another one later on 
or not.” he said, “but 1 doubt it.” 
And then, “Apparently all of them 
got through in time except one. and 
since IPS already has that one, 
there’s no point in our hanging 
around here any longer.” 

M iss Larkin looked wistfully out 
over the plain. “N — no, I 
guess there isn’t,” she said. 



By this time, flames had all but 
destroyed Blue Bolt’s buddies, but 
Blue Bolt himself was made of stern- 
er stuff. Probably he was a newer 
model. In any event, smoke had 
ceased issuing from his mouth, nose, 
and ears, and Farrell was able to 
strap him on Salome’s back for later 
examination by IPS. Before doing so, 
he peered through the head-hatch. 
He saw two tiny bucket seats, a 
Lilliputian, unbelievably complex, 
control panel, a little loud speaker, 
and a small television screen. Mount- 
ed between the seats, its muzzle out 
of sight beyond an airtight partition, 
was a diminutive energy gun. 

He climbed back into the woolly 
mammothmobile and sat down be- 
side Miss Larkin. He threw the pal- 
eethnologivehicle into gear. “Come 
on, Salome, let’s go.” 

A time-wave message from IPS 
was awaiting him in the entry-area. 
It registered on Salome’s electronic 
bulletin board the moment she en- 
tered the time field. MISS LARKIN 
OBTAINED POSITION BY RE- 
COURSE TO FRAUDULENT 
MEANS, it read, AND HAS BEEN 
FIRED IN ABSENTIA. IPS AS- 
SUMES NO FURTHER RESPON- 
SIBIUTY FOR HER WELFARE 
AND YOU ARE ORDERED TO 
RETURN PRESENTSIDE IMME- 
DIATELY. 

Miss Larkin emitted a little sigh. 
‘‘Well,” she said, “I guess it’s back 
to the ecdysiast mines.” And then, 
“I — I think I ought to tell you 
before it’s too late, Mr. Farrell, that 
all ecdysiasts aren’t — aren’t — well, 
they just aren’t what you probably 
think they are. She gave him a wist- 



ORIGIN OF SPECIES 



87 




ful look, and he saw that she was 
crying. “Ah — anyway, I hope. you’ll 
come to see me at Big Anna’s.” 

Sure he’d go to see her. Sure he 
would. Like so much mud! Some 
damsel in distress she’d turned out 
to be! Leading him on with that nice- 
girl line of hers and building up his 
hopes and renewing his faith in 
womankind, and then, when he was 
half gone on her, doing a strip-tease 
right before his very eyes! That 
would be the (foy when he went to 
see her! ^ 

“Good-by,” he said, when they 
arrived at the time-station, and walk- 
ed away without another word. 

4 6VJ^hat’ll you have, sir?” asked 
▼ ^ the woman with the enor- 
mous bosom. 

Haunted, Farrell sat down on an 
empty barstool. “Beer,” he said. And 
then, “What time does Miss Larkin 
come on?” 

“You mean Laurie? She’ll be 



on any minute now,” she answered. 

Farrell sipped his beer and kept 
his eyes on the large dais at the end 
of the crowded bar. Presently the 
fluoros were dimmed and the plat- 
form was bathed in pale blue radi- 
ance from an overhead spotlight. A 
moment later Miss Larkin stepped 
into view. She wa|s wearing a golden 
shift, cobweb stockings, and glass 
slippers. Taped music sounded, and 
she began to dance. 

Farrell let her get as far as the 
first layer of underthings. Then he 
barged down the bar, reached up 
and grabbed her ankle, and pulled 
her down beside him. She gasped 
when she recognized him, and stop- 
ped kicking and biting, and a twin- 
kle came into her eyes. He slung 
her over his shoulder, cave-man 
style. “If you’re going to dance for 
anybody, you’re going to dance for 
me,” he said, and carried her out of 
the bar and down the street to the 
nearest matrimonialmat. END 



Next Month in B . ■ 

With the new expanded size of If we can bring a lot of additional material 
to you each month; so next month, besides a hefty chunk of Rettef"s War, we present a 
complete short novel by Kenneth Bulmer, The Doomsday Men. The thing about the Men 
is the nature of their jobs. They are detectives, in a way. They solve murders, or try to. 
And the way they do it is by entering the minds of the victims . and what they find 
there is sometimes more fearful than the act of murder itself . 

It looks as though we'fl also include two novelettes at least — Fred Saberhagen^ 
latest Berserkier story. The Masque of fhe Red Shift, and a fine job by Gordon R. Dickson 
called Tiger Green. And shorts, of course. 

And a little farther ahead — well, we've just been through dne of those great, and 
oil too infrequent, times in an editor's Rfe when he starts a covey of first-rate stories 
and bogs a harvest of beauties. Just for instance: Heinlein's newest novel starts on the 
heels of Refief's War — and we think it's his best in years. Then comes a Keith Laumer- 
Rosel G. Brown collaboration called Earfhblood and Algis Budrys's The Iron Thorn — all 
serials, and all the kind we're proud to present. Add to that some long novelettes and 
short noveb by Fowl Anderson. A. E. Von Vogt, Hal Clement and others, either In hand

PURPOSE 

by EDWARD V. DONG 

Men had created the Machine. 

Now the Men were gone — and 
if had to make its own plansi 

¥ 

r 



T lie Machine sat on a lonely hill 
on a bleak, desolated Earth — an 
Earth devastated by an interstellar 
nucleonic storm. It pondered the rea- 
son of its continued existence. 

Fact: It was brought into being 
by the last men — by the last of the 
extinct human race. 

Fact: It was created to combat 
the menace of the nucleonic storm. 

Fact: It failed. It was too- little 
and too late to save the human race 
from its final, ultimate Armageddon. 

Then its purpose was altered. It 
could no longer save the race from 
extinction. Tl\e Machine could re- 
member the change in its instruc- 
tions. Minute pulses flowed within 
the Machine and from its memory 
banks flashed the last minutes of the 
last man across the Machine’s arti- 
ficial consciousness. 

It remembered the man — the 
programmer on whose shoulders sat 
the responsibility for saving the 
Earth and the human race — and 
who had failed. An image — a vis- 



ual and audio image — of the pro- 
grarrimer formed now in the Ma- 
chine’s mind’s eye. 

Fact: The man’s name was Mi- 
chelson. John Michelson. He had 
been dressed in technician’s overalls 
and he had been sitting at the round 
console of controls. He had been 
waiting. The Machine recalled that 
the man seemed content and that 
the fact of his tranquility seemed 
a little strange to the man. 

Death — the termination of hum- 
an consciousness — for Michelson 
was only minutes away. The man 
knew this and so did the Machine. 
The storm had ravaged and raped 
the surface of the Earth and wore 
away the green of its vegetation and 
evaporated or boiled away the blue 
of its seas. There was only a barren 
Earth left now — and the storm it- 
self, still raging. The control room 
was sealed, but the terrible fury of 
the storm gradually eroded and 
etched away the protective insula- 
tion. The Machine was protected 



89 



against the storm, but the Man was 
not. Even as the thought of his per- 
sonal death crossed the man’s mind, 
the first wisps of the unearthly 
energy that filled the center and eye 
of the storm floated and whirled 
their way into the .control room, 
wrecking havoc with everything that 
was in it. 

“This is it,” the man said softly, 
to no one in particular and only 
perhaps to the Machine in general. 
Suddenly there was new determina- 
tion, new steel in Michelson’s voice, 
as fanaticism and fatalism gripped 
his soul. “Listen, Machine. A change 
in your instructions. Henceforth, you 
will be the monument to Man to 
wait for new life to appear in the 
solar system — ” 

The Machine caught the purpose 
of the last instructions. It was to 
serve as the final eulogy for the 
human race. Itl The Machinel The 
last creation of a dying and vanish- 
ing race of bipeds. It! The ultimate 
univac — the last computer — was 
to be the last memory of the human 
race — when everything else that 
was of Man had vanished before the 
incredible fury of the nucleonic 
storm. The last remainder to the 
hostile and the indifferent universe 
that the human race did come out 
of the slime, did reach high heights, 
and so left traces in the sands of 
eternity. 

But now, after many revolutions 
of the Earth about the sun had 
come and had passed, the emptiness 
of the last instructions weighed even 
on the Machine’s artificial conscious- 
ness. It, the last computer, was al- 
most human, and it could feel the 



utter futility of the last instructions. 
The programmer — John Michelson 
— wanted it to wait for new life, a 
new race of intelligent beings to 
evolve out of the ravaged remains 
of Earth or to come from outer 
space, and to tell them that there 
was a race before them who had 
transpired and aspired to greatness. 

The storm had passed and all was 
quiet on barren Earth. Vast craters 
yawned; pits and scar^ criss-crossed 
and etched the face of Earth. But 
the Machine still continued to func- 
tion. And yearn. 

T he Machine yearned for some- 
thing that it recognized it might 
never have. The Machine yearned, 
desired desperately for fulfillment, 
for completion. It knew itself. It 
knew that it was dead. That it was 
as sterile as the Earth outside. Dead 
and sterile without completion or 
fulfillment. 

But it could not circumvent its 
instructions. It could not change its 
orders. It could do nothing but wait. 
Wait for fate to enter the picture 
and change the situation. 

Then it happened. A meteor, one 
of the last of the Leonoid swarm, 
crashed on the hill where the Ma- 
chine waited. It smashed part of the 
programming unit and so released 
the Machine from its last instruc- 
tions. It was free — free! — Free! 
The fact of its freedom loomed large 
in its consciousness. And then the 
fact of its unfulfillment loomed as 
well. 

Now, the Machine could alter its 
instructions — direct itself to what- 
ever projects it willed. And it willed, 



90 



IF 




desperately, with a desperation im- 
possible for living beings to endure, 
for fulfillment — for completion of 
itself. ‘ 

It had all the knowledge that the 
human race had accumulated in 
5,000 years in its memory storage 
banks, and it had built-in powertools 
to create what it willed. And the 
Machine embarked on one project 
— the one project that might yield 
what it craved with terrible inten- 
sity. 

And it was done. The Machine 
looked upon the results of its handi- 
work and pondered the fact of the 
results. 

Michelson stirred — the pseudo- 
identity that knew itself only as the 
Machine’s last programmer stirred 
within the far larger consciousness 
of the Machine — for the Machine 
had detached part of itself and re- 
created within it the personality and 
memories of the last human being. 
For Michelson gave direction, pur- 
pose, completion to the Machine, 
The Machine was fulfilled. 

Then, as Michelson stirred, the 
Machine listened to his thoughts, for 
the pseudo-identity was part of itself. 

I! / am John Michelson! I was 
dressed in technician's overalls! 

I! 

r am — ALIVE! 

But not even the Machine could 
conceive of perfection; there was a 
flaw in its reincarnation of the last 
programmer. A flaw which it did 
not anticipate. 

/ am ALIVE! But the human race 
of which I am a part is not! The 
race is DEADI 



Michelson himself was cheated of 
its completion — its fulfillment. 
Cheated of the finality and the ab- 
solution of death. 

I am RESPONSIBLE! But I 
MUST NOT BE! 

T he Machine could do nothing; 

it was enslaved; it was enchain- 
ed to its own Frankenstein’s mons- 
ter. It now knew what had happen- 
ed. 

Michelson was alive, not dead, 
and so he again bore the responsibil- 
ity and the guilt of failure — a guilt 
that he could not bear — a guilt of 
failing the whole of the human race. 

He could not die, but he could 
not be responsible. He could not die, 
but he remembered that he couldn’t 
save the human race — that he had 
failed the human race in its last 
desperate hour. 

He couldn’t tolerate the responsi- 
bility! So his mind snapped violently 
and fled from the guilt that it could 
not bear for so much as an instant 
— and retreated to its only happy 
time — back along Its umbilical cord 
of memory, forgetting his adulthood, 
now recalling only his childhood. 

And the Machine was forced to 
accede to Michelson’s old, old child:- 
hood dream. 

Daddy, daddy! I want my toys, 
daddy! Daddy! 

Out of the Machine’s conscious- 
ness came a fairyland for Michel- 
son. And Michelson himself was 
completed now. 

In the Machine’s mind’s eye, he 
rode his childhood’s dream — he 
rode a unicorn. END

An Ounce 
of Emotion 

by GORDON R. DICKSON 



Illustrated by GIUNTA 



There was plenty of hostility 
on the planet of the aliens — 
most of it between the humansl 



I 

44\J^cll? Are the ships joined — 
^ ^ or not?” demanded Ar- 
thur Mial. 

‘‘Look for yourself I” said Ty- 
rone Ross. 

Mial turned and went on out of 
the room. All right, thought Ty sav- 
agely, call it a personality conflict. 
Putting a tag on it is one thing, 
doing something about it another. 
And I have to do something — it 



could just be the fuse to this nitro- 
jelly situation he, I, and Annie are 
all sitting on. There must be some 
way I can break down this feeling 
between us. 

Ty glanced for a moment across 
the spaceliner stateroom at the sta- 
tistical analysis instrument, called 
Annie, now sitting silent and unim- 
pressive as a black steamer trunk 
against a far wall. 

It was Annie who held the hope 
of peace for thousands of cubic 



92 



light years of interstellar space in 
every direction. Annie — with the 
help of Ty. And the dubious help 
of Mial. The instrument, thought 
Ty grimly, deserved better than the 
two particular human companions 
the Laburti had permitted, to bring 
her to them. 

He turned back to the vision 
screen he had been watching earlier. 

On it, pictured from the view- 
point of one of the tractor mechs 
now maneuvering the ship, this le- 
viathan of a Laburti spaceliner he 
was on was being laid alongside and 
only fifty yards from an equally 
huge Chedal vessel. Even Ty’s un- 
trained eye could see the hair-trigger 
risks in bringing those hundreds of 
thousands of tons of mass so close 
together. But with the two Great 
Races, so-called, poised on the verge 
of conflict, the Chedal Observer of 
the Annie Demonstration five days 
from now could not be simply fer- 
ried from his ship to this like any 
ordinary passenger. 

" The two ships must be faced, 
main airlock to main airlock, and a 
passageway fitted between the locks. 
So that the Chedal and hi* staff 
could stroll aboard with all due pro- 
tocol. Better damage either or both 
of the giant craft than chance any 
suspicion of a slight by one of the 
Great Races to a representative of 
the other. 

For the Laburti and the Chedal 
were at a sparking point. A spark- 
ing point of war that — but of 
course neither race of aliens was 
concerned about that — could see 
small Earth drafted into the armed 
camp of its huge Laburti neighbor; 



and destroyed by the Chedal horde, 
if the interstellar conflict swept past 
Alpha Centauri. 

It was merely, if murderously, ir- 
onic in this situation that Ty and 
Mial who came bearing the slim 
hope of peace that was Annie, should 
be themselves at a sparking point. A 
sparking point willed by neither — 
but to which they had both been 
born. 

T y’s thoughts came back from the 
vision screen to their original 
preoccupation. 

It happened sometimes, he 
thought. It just — happened. Some- 
times, for no discernable reason, 
suddenly and without warning, two 
men meeting for the first time felt 
the ancient furies buried deep in 
their forebrains leap abruptly and 
redly to life. It was rapport between 
individuals turned inside oift — anti- 
rapport# Under it, the animal instinct 
in each man instantly snarled and 
bristled, recognizing a mortal en^my 
— an enemy not in act or attitude, 
but simply in being. 

So it had happened with Ty — 
and Mial. Back on Earth, thought 
Ty now, while there was still a 
chance to do something about the 
situation, they had each been too 
civilized to speak up about it. Now 
it was too late. T^e mistake was 
made. 

And mistake it had been. For, 
practical engineer and reasonable 
man that Ty was, reasonable man 
and practical politician that Mial 
was, to the rest of mankind — to 
each other they were tigers. And 
common sense dictated that you did 



AN OUNCE OF EMOTION 



93 




not pen two tigers alone together 
for two weeks; for a delicate mission 
on which the future existence of the 
human race might depend. Already, 
after nine days out — 

“We’ll have to go meet the Che- 
dal.” It was Mfal, reentering the 
room. Ty turned reflexively to face 
him. 

The other man was scarcelv a 
dozen years older than Ty; and in 
many ways they were nearly alike. 
There could not be half an inch 
or five pounds of weight difference 
between them, thought Ty. Like Tv, 
Mial was square-shouldered and 
leanly built. But his hair was dark 
where Ty’s was blond; and that 
dark hair had started to recede. TTie 
face below it was handsome, rather 
than big-boned and open like Ty’s. 
Mial, at thirty-six, was something of 
a wonder boy in politics back on 
Earth. Barely old enough for the 
senatorial seat he held, he^ had the 
respect of almost everyone. But he 
had been legal counsel for some un- 
savory groups in the beginning of his 
career. He would know how, thought 
Ty watching him now, to fight dirty 
if he had to. And the two of them 
were off with none but aliens to 
witness. 

C4T know,*' said Ty now, harshly. 

X He turned to follow Mial as 
the other man started out of the 
room. “What about Annie?” 

Mial looked back over his shoul- 
der. 

“She’s safe enough. What good’s 
a machine to them if no one but 
a human can run her?” Mial’s voice 
was almost taunting. “You can’t go 



up with the big boys, Ross, and act 
scared.” 

Ty’s face flushed with internal 
heat — but it was true, what Mial 
had said. A midget trying to make 
peace with giants did well not to 
act doubtful or afraid. Mial had 
courage to see it. Ty felt an unwill- 
ing touch of admiration for the man. 
I could almost like him for that, he 
thought — if I didn’t hate his guts. 

By the time they got to the air- 
lock, the slim, dog-faced, and dark- 
ly-robed Laburti were in their receiv- 
ing line, and the first of the squat, 
yellow-furred Chedal forms were 
coming .through. First came the 
guards; then the Observer himself, 
distinguishable to a human eye only 
by the sky-blue harness he wore. The 
tall, thin form of the robed Laburti 
Captain glided forward to welcome 
him aboard first; and then the Ob- 
server moved down the line, to con- 
front Mial. 

A high-pitched chattering came 
from the Chedal’s lipless slit of a 
mouth, almost instantly overridden 
by the artificial, translated human 
speech from the black translator col- 
lar around the alien’s thick, yellow- 
furred neck. Shortly, Mial was re- 
plying in kind, his own black trans- 
lator collar turning his human words 
into Chedal chitterings. Ty stood lis- 
tening, half-selfconscious, half-bored. 

“ — and my Demonstration Oper- 
ator.” Ty woke suddenly to the fact 
that Mial was introducing him to 
the Chedal. 

“Honored,” said Ty, and heard 
his collar translating. 

“May I invite you both to my 
suite now, immediately, for the pur- 



94 



IF 




pose of improving our acquaintance 
. The invitation extended itself, 
became flowery, and ended with a 
flourish. 

“It’s an honor to accept . , 
Mial was answering. Ty braced him- 
self for at least another hour of this 
before they could get back to their 
own suite. 

Then his breath caught in his 
throat. 

“. for myself, that is,” Mial 
was completing his answer. “Unfor- 
tunately, I earlier ordered my Opera- 
tor to return immediately to his de- 
vice, once these greetings were over. 
And I make it a practice never to 
change an order. I’m sure you un- 
derstand.” 

“Of course. Some other time I 
will host your Operator. Shall we 
two go?” T^e Chedal turned and led 
off. Mial was turning with him, 
when Ty stepped in front of him. 

“Hold on — ” Ty remembered to 
turn off his translator collar. “What’s 
this about your ordering me — ” 

Mial flicked off his own translator 
collar. 

“You heard me,” he said. He step- 
ped around Ty and walked off. Ty 
stood, staring after him. Then, con- 
scious of the gazing Laburti all about 
him, he turned and headed back to- 
ward their own suite. 

Once back there, and with the 
door to the ship’s corridor safely 
closed behind him, he swore and 
turned to checking out Annie, to 
make sure there had been no investi- 
gation or tampering with her innards 
while he was absent. Taking off the 
side panel of her case, he pinched 
his finger between the panel and the 



case and swore again. Then he sat 
down suddenly, ignoring Annie and 
began to think. 

n 

\^^ith the jab of pain from the 
^ ^ pinched finger, an incredible 
suspicion had sprung> full-armed in- 
to his brain. For the first time he 
found himself wondering if Mial’s 
lie to the Chedal about an ‘order’ to 
Ty had been part of some plan by 
the other man against Ty. A plan 
that required Mial’s talking with the 
Chedal Observer alone, before Ty 
did. 

It was, Ty had to admit, the kind 
of suspicion that only someone who 
felt as he did about Mial could have 
dreamed up. And yet ... 

The orders putting the Annie De- 
monstration Mission — which meant 
Annie and Ty — under the author- 
ity of Mial had been merely a polite 
fiction. A matter of matching the 
high rank and authority of the La- 
burti and Chedal officials who would 
be watching the Demonstration as 
Observers. Ty had been clearly given 
to understand that by his own De- 
partment chief, back on Earth. 

In other words, Mial ha^ just 
now stopped playing according to 
the unwritten rules of the Mission. 
That might bode ill for Ty. And, 
thought Ty now, suddenly, it might 
bode even worse for the success of 
the Mission. But it was unthinkable 
that Mial would go so far as to risk 
that. 

For, it was one thing to stand 
here with Annie and know she rep- 
resented something possessed by nei- 



AN OUNCE OF EMOTION

ther the Laburti nor the Chedal tech- 
nologies. It was all right to remind 
oneself that human science was 
growing like the human population; 
and that population was multiplying 
at close to three per cent per year — 
as opposed to a fraction of a per 
cent for the older Chedal and La- 
burti populations. 

But there were present actualities 
that still had to be faced — like the 
size of this ship, and that of the 
Chedal ship now parting from it. 
Also, like the twenty-odd teeming 
worlds apiece, the thousands of years 
each of post-atomic civilization, the 
armed might either sprawling alien 
empire could boast. 

Mial could not — would not — 
be playing some personal game m 
die fact of all this. Ty shook his 
head angrily at the thought. No man 



could be such a fool, no matter 
what basic emotional factor was 
driving him. 

V^hen Mial returned to their 
^ ^ stateroom suite a couple of 
hours later, Ty made an effort to 
speak pleasantly to him. 

“Well?’’ said Ty, “how’d it go? 
And when am I to meet him?” 

Mial looked at him coldly. 
“You’ll be told,” he said, and 
went on into his bedroom. 

But, in the four days left of the 
trip to the Laburti World, where 
the Demonstration was to be given 
before a joint audience of Laburti 
and Chedal Observers, it became in- 
creasingly apparent Ty was not to 
meet the Chedal. Meanwhile, Mial 
was increasingly in conference with 
the alien representative.

Ty gritted his' teeth. At least, at 
their destination the Mission would 
be moving directly to the Human 
Consulate. And the Consul in charge 
was not a human, but a Laburti 
citizen who had contracted for the 
job of representing the Earth race. 
Mial could hardly hold secret con- 
ferences with the Chedal under a 
Laburti nose. 

Ty was still reminding himself of 
this as the spaceliner finally settled 
toward their destination — a fantas- 
tic metropolis, with eight and ten 
thousand foot tall buildings rising 
out of what Ty had been informed 
was a quarter-mile depth of open 
ocean. Ty had just finished getting 
Annie rigged for handling when 
Mial came into the room. 

“Ready?” demanded Mial. 

“Ready,” said Ty. 



“You go ahead with Annie and 
the baggage — ” The sudden, soft 
hooting of the landing horn inter- 
rupted Mial, and there was a faint 
tremor all through the huge ship as 
it came to rest in its landing cradle 
of magnetic forces; the main door 
to the suite from the corridor swung 
open. A freight-handling mech slid 
into the room and approached An- 
nie. 

“I’ll meet you outside in the 
taxi area,” concluded Mial. 

Ty felt abrupt and unreasonable 
suspicion. 

“Why?” he asked sharply. 

Mial had already turned toward 
the open door through which the 
mech had just entered. He paused 
and turned back to face Ty; a smile, 
razor blade thin and cruel altered his 
handsome face. 



AN OUNCE OF EMOTION 



n 



“Because that’s what I’m going 
to do,” he said softly, and turned 
again toward the door. 

T y stared after him for a moment, 
jarred and irresolute at the 
sudden, fresh outbreak of hostilities, 
and Mial went qut through the door. 

“Wait a minutel” snapped Ty, 
heading after him. But the other 
man was already gone, and the 
mech, carrying Annie and following 
close behind him, had blocked Ty’s 
path. Cold with anger, Ty swung 
back to check their personal bag- 
gage, including their food supplies, 
as another mech entered to carry 
these to the outside of the ship. 

When he finally got outside to the 
disembarkation area, and got the 
baggage, as well as Annie, loaded 
on to one of the flying cargo plat- 
forms that did taxi service among 
the Laburti, he looked around for 
Mial. He discovered the other man 
a short distance away in the disem- 
barkation area, talking again with a 
blue-harnessed, yellow-furred form. 

Grimly, Ty turned on his transla- 
tor collar and gave the cargo plat- 
form the address of the human Con- 
sulate. Then, he lifted a section of 
the transparent cover of the plat- 
form and stepped aboard, to sit 
down on the luggage and wait for 
Mial. After a while, he saw Mial 
break off his conversation and ap- 
proach the cargo platform. The 
statesman spoke briefly to the cargo 
platform, something Ty could not 
hear from under the transparent cov- 
er, then came aboard and sat down 
next to Ty. 

The platform lifted into the air 



and headed in between the blue and 
gray metal of the towers with their 
gossamer connecting bridges. 

“I already told it where to take 
us,” said Ty. 

Mial turned to look at him brief- 
ly and almost contemptuously, then 
turned away again without answer- 
ing. 

The platform slid amongst the 
looming towers and finally flew 
them in through a wide window- 
opening, into a room set up with 
human-style furniture. They got off, 
and Ty looked around as the plat- 
form began to unload the baggage. 
There was no sign of the Laburti 
individual who filled the role of 
human Consul. Sudden suspicion 
blossomed again in Ty. 

a minute — ” He wheeled 
about — but the platform, 
already unloaded, was lifting out 
through the window opening again. 
Ty turned on Mial. “This isn’t the 
Consulate!” 

“That’s right,” Mial almost drawl- 
ed the words. “It’s a hotel — the 
way they have them here. The Che- 
dal Observer recommended it to me.” 

“Recommended — ?” Ty stared. 
“We’re supposed to go to the Con- 
sulate. You can’t — ” 

“Can’t I?” Mial’s eyes were begin- 
ning to blaze. The throttled fury 
in him was yammering to be releas- 
ed, evidently, as much as its coun- 
terpart in Ty. “I don’t trust that 
Consulate, with its Laburti playing 
human Consul. Here, if the Chedal 
wants to drop by — ” 

“He’s not supposed to drop byr 
Ty snarled. “We’re here to demoii- 



98 



IF 




ttrate Annie, not gabble with the 
Observers. What’ll the Laburti think 
if they find you and the Chedal 
^ued together half of the time?” He 
got himself under control and said 
in a lower voice. “We’re going back 
to the Consulate, now — ” 

“Are we?” Mial almost hissed. 
“Are you forgetting that the orders 
show me in charge of this Demon- 
stration — and that the aliens’ll be- 
lieve those orders? Besides, you don’t 
know your way around here. And, 
after talking to the Chedal — I do!” 
He turned abruptly and strode 
over to an apparently blank wall. 
He rapped on it, and flicked on his 
translator collar and spoke to the 
wall. 

“Open up!” The wall slid open 
to reveal what was evidently an 
elevator tube. He stepped into it 
and turned to smile mockingly at 
Ty, drifting down out of sight. The 
wall closed behind him. 

“Open up!” raged Ty, striding to 
the wall and rapping on it. He flick- 
ed on his translator collar. “Open 
up. Do you hear me? Open up!” 

But the wall did not open. Ty, his 
knuckles getting sore, at last gave 
up and turned back to Annie. 

ni 

*l^Thatever else might be going on, 
^ ^ his responsibility to her and 
the Demonstration tomorrow, re- 
mained unchanged. He got her han- 
dling rigging off, and ran a sample 
problem through her. When he was 
done, he checked the resultant fig- 
ures against the answers to the prob- 
lem already established by multiple 



statistics back on Earth. He was 
within a fraction of a per cent all 
the way down the line. 

Ty glowed, in spite of himself. Op- 
erating Annie successfully was not 
so much a skill, as an art. In any 
problem, there were from fourteen 
to twenty factors whose values had 
to be adjusted according to the in- 
stincts and creativity of the Operat- 
or. It was this fact that was the 
human ace in the hole in this situa- 
tion. Aliens could not run Annie — 
they had tried on Annie’s proto- 
tvpes and failed. Only a few special- 
ly trained and talented humans could 
run her successfully . and of 
these, Ty Ross was the master Op- 
erator. TTiat was why he was here. 

Now, tomorrow he would have to 
prove his right to that title. Under 
his hands Annie could show that a 
hundred and twenty-five Earth years 
after the Laburti and Chedal went 
to war, the winner would have a 
Gross Racial Product only eight per 
cent increased over today — so se- 
vere would the conflict have been. 
But in a hundred and twenty-five 
years of peaceful co-existence and 
cooperation, both races would have 
doubled their G.R.P.s in spite of 
having made only fractional in- 
creases in population. And machines 
like Annie, with operators like Ty, 
stood ready to monitor and guide 
the G.R.P. increases. No sane race 
could go to war in the face of that. 

Meanwhile, Mial had not return- 
ed. Outside the weather shield of 
the wide window, the local sun, a 
G5 star, was taking its large, orange- 
yellow shape below the watery ho- 
rizon. Ty made himself something to

cat, read a while, and then took 
himself to bed in one of the adjoin- 
ing bedrooms. But disquieting mem- 
ories kept him from sleeping. 

H e remembered now that there 
had been an argument back on 
Earth, about the proper way to make 
use of Annie. He had known of this 
for a long time, Mial’s recent ac- 
tions came forcing it back into the 
forefront of his sleepless mind 
The political people back home 
had wanted Annie to be used as a 
tool, and a bargaining point, rather 
than a solution to the Labiirti- 
Chedal confrontation, in herself. It 
was true, Ty reminded himself in 
the darkness, Mial had not been 
one of those so arguing. But he was 
of the same breed and occupation 
as they, reminded the little red 
devils of suspicion, coming out to 
dance on Ty’s brain. With a sullen 
effort Tv shoved them out of his 
mind and forced himself to think 
of somethin? else — anythin? else 
And, after a while, he slept. 

He woke suddenly, feeling himself 
being shaken back to consciousness. 
The lights were on in the room and 
Mial was shaking him. 

“WViat?” Ty sat up, knocking the 
other man’s hand aside. 

“The Chedal Observer’s here with 
me.” said Mial. “He wants a pre- 
view demonstration of the analyzer.” 
“A preview!” Ty burst up out of 
bed ro stand facing the other man. 
“Whv should he get to see Annie 
before the official Demonstration?” 
“Because I said he could.” Un- 
derneath. MiaPs eyes were stained 
by dark halt-circles ot tatigue. 



“Well, 1 say he can wait untfl 
tomorrow like the Laburtil” snapped 
Ty. He added, “ — And don’t try to 
pull vour paper rank on me. If I 
don’t run Annie for him, who’s to 
do it? You?” 

Mial’s weary face paled with an- 
ger. 

“The Chedal asked for the pre- 
view,” he said, in a tight, low voice. 
“I didn’t think I had the right to 
refuse him, important as this Mis- 
sion is. Do you want to take the 
responsibility of doing it? Annie’U 
come up with the same answers now 
as seven hours from now.” 

“Almost the same — ” muttered 
Ty. “They’re never exact, I told yon 
that.” He swayed on his feet, caught 
between sleep and resentment. 

“As you say,” said Mial, “I can’t 
make you do it.” 

Ty hesitated a second more. But 
his brain seemed numb. 

“All right,” he snapped. “I’ll hav® 
to get dressed. Five minutes!” 

Mial turned and went out. When 
Ty followed, some five minutes 
later, he found both the other man 
and the alien in the sitting room. 
The Chedal came toward Ty, and 
for a moment they were closer than 
they had been even in the space- 
liner airlock. For the first time, 
Ty smelled a faint, sickening odor 
from the alien, a scent like over- 
ripe bananas. 

T he Chedal handed him a roll of 
paper-like material. Gibberish 
raved from his lipless mouth and was 
translated by the translator collar. 
“Here is the data you will need.” 
“Thank you,” said Ty, with bare 



100 



IF 




drility. He took the roll over to 
Annie and examined it. It con- 
tained aU the necessary statistics on 
both the Labuiti and Chedal races, 
from the Gross Racial Products 
down to statistical particulars. He 
went to work, feeding the data into 
Annie. 

Time flowed by, catching him up 
in the rhythm of his work as it 
went. 

His job with Annie required 
just this sort of concentration and 
involvement, and for a little while 
he forgot the two watching him. He 
looked up at last to see the window 
aperture flushed with yellow-pink 
dawn, and guessed that perhaps an 
hour had gone by. 

He tore loose the tape he had 
been handling, and walked with it 
to the Chedal. 

‘'Here,” he said, putting the tape 
into the blunt, three-fingered hands, 
and pointing to the first figures. 
There’s your G.R.P. half a standard 
year after agreement to co-exist 
with Laburti. — Up three thousands 
of one per cent already. And here 
it is at the end of a full year — ” 

“And the Laburti?” demanded the 
translated chittering of the aHen. 

“Down here. You see. .” Ty 
talked on. The Chedal watched, his 
perfectly round, black eyes emotion- 
less as the button-eyes of a child’s 
toy. When Ty was finished, the 
alien, still holding the tape, swung 
on Mial, turning his back to Ty. 

“We will check this, of course,” 
the Chedal said to Mial. “But your 
price is high.” He turned and went 
out. 

AN OUNCE OF EMOTION 



Ty stood staring after him. 

“What price?” he asked, huskily. 
His throat was suddenly dry. He 
swung on Mial. “What price is it 
that’s too high?” 

“The price of cooperation with 
the Laburti!” snarled Mial. “They 
and the Chedal hate each other — 
or haven’t you noticed?” He turned 
and stalked off into, the opposite 
bedroom, slamming the door behind 
him. 

Ty stood staring at the closed 
surface. He made a step toward it, 
Mial had evidently been up all 
night. This, combined with the 
emotional situation between them, 
would make it pointless for Ty to 
try to question him. 

B esides, thought Ty, hollowly and 
coldly, diere was no need. Ho 
turned back across the room to the 
pile of their supplies and got out 
the coffeemaker. It was a little sel^ 
contained unit that could brew up 
a fresh cup in something like thirty 
seconds; for those thirty seconds, 
Ty kept his mind averted from the 
problem. Then, with the cup of hot, 
black coffee in his hands, he sat 
down to decide what to do. 

Mial’s answer to his question 
about the Chedal’s mention of price 
had been thoughtless and trans- 
parent — the answer of a man 
scourged by dislike and mind-numbed 
by fatigue. Clearly, it could not be 
anything so simple as the general 
price of cooperation with a disliked 
other race, to which the Chedal 
Observer had been referring. No — 
it had to have been a specific price. 

101 




And a specific price ha* wa^ part 
of specific, personal negotiations 
held in secret between the alien and 
Mial. 

Such personal negotiations were 
»o part of the Demonstration plans 
•s Ty knew them. Therefore Mial 
was not following those plans. 
Clearly, he was following some other 
course of action. 

And this, to Ty, could only 
be the course laid down by those 
political minds back on Earth who 
had wanted to use Annie as a pawn 
to their maneuvering, instead of pre- 
senting the statistical analysis in- 
strument plainly and honestly by it- 
self to the Laburti and the Chedal 
Observers. 

If this was the case, the whole 
hope ol the Demonstration hung 
in the balance. Mial, sparked by in- 
stinctive hatred for Ty, was opposing 
himself not merely to Ty but to 
everything Ty stood for — including 
the straight-forward presentation of 
Annie’s capabilities. Instead, he must 
be dickering with the Chedal 
for some agreement that would 
league humanity with the Chedal 
and against the Laburti — a wild, 
unrealistic action when the solar 
system lay wholly within the power- 
ful Laburti stellar sphere of influ- 
ence. 

A moment’s annoyance on the 
part of the Laburti — a moment’s 
belief that the humans had been 
tryino to trick them and play games 
with their Chedal enemy — and the 
Laburti forces could turn Earth 
to a drifting cinder of a world with 
as little effort as a giant stepping 
on an ant. 



I f this was what Mial was doing 
— and by now Ty was con- 
vinced of it — the other man must 
be stopped, at any cost. 

But how? 

Ty shivered suddenly and un- 
controllably. The room seemed ab- 
ruptly as icy as a polar tundra. 

There waQ nnlv one wav to ston 
Mial, who could not be reasoned 
with — by Ty, at least — either on 
the emotional or the intellectual 
level; and who held the paper proofs 
of authority over Ty and Annie. 
Mial would have to be physically 
removed from the Demonstration. 
If necessary — rather than risk the 
life on Earth and the whole human 
race — he would have to be killed. 

And it would have to look like 
an accident. Anything else would 
cause the aliens to halt the Demon- 
stration. 

The shiver went away without 
warning — leaving only a momen- 
tary flicker of doubt in Ty, a 
second’s wonder if perhaps his own 
emotional reaction to Mial was not 
hurrying him to take a step that 
might not be justified. Then, that 
flicker went out. With the Demon- 
stration only hours away, Ty could 
not stop to examine his motives. 
He had to act and hope he was right. 

He looked across the room at 
Annie. The statistical analysis in- 
strument housed her own electrical 
power source and it was powerful 
enough to give a lethal jolt to a 
human heart. Her instruments and 
controls were insulated from the 
metal case, but the case itself . 

Ty put down his coffee cup and 
walked over to the instrument. He 



102 



IF 




got busy. It was not difficult. Half 
an hour later, as the sun of this 
world was rising out of the sea, he 
finished, and went back to his room 
for a few hours’ sleep. He fell in- 
stantly into slumber and slept 
heavily. 

IV 

H e jerked awake. The loon-like 
hooting in his ears; and stand- 
ing over his bed was the darkly 
robed figure of a Laburti. 

Ty scrambled to his feet, reaching 
for a bathrobe. 

‘‘What. ?” he blurted. 

Hairless, gray-skinned and dog- 
faced, narrow-shouldered in the 
heavy, dark robes he wore, the 
Laburti looked back at him ex- 
pressionlessly. 

"Where is Demonstration Chief 
Arthur Mial?” The words came 
seemingly without emotion from the 
translator collar, over the sudden 
deep, harsh-voiced yammering from 
the face above it. 

"I — in the bedroom.” 

“He is not there.” 

“But ...” Ty, belting the bath- 
robe, strode around the alien, out 
of his bedroom, across the interven- 
ing room and looked into the room 
into which Mial had disappeared 
only a few hours before. T^e bed 
there was rumpled, but empty. Ty 
turned back into the center room 
where Annie stood. Behind her black 
metal case, the alien sun was ap- 
proaching the zenith position of 
noon. 

“You will come with me,” said 
the Laburti. 



Ty turned to protest. But two 
more Laburti had come into dio 
suite, carrying the silver-tipped de- 
vices which Ty had been briefed 
back on Earth, were weapons. Fol- 
lowing them came mechs which 
gathered up the baggage and Annie. 
Ty cut off the protest before it 
could reach his lips. There was no 
point in arguing. But where was 
Mial? 

They crossed a distance of the 
alien city by flying platform and 
came at last into another tower, and 
a large suite of rooms. The Laburti 
who had woken Ty led him into an 
interior room where yet another 
Laburti stood, robed and impassive. 

“These,” said the Laburti who had 
brought Ty there, “are the quarters 
belonging to me. I am the Consul 
for your human race on this world. 
This — ” the alien nodded at tha 
other robed figure, “is the Observer 
of our Laburti race, who was to 
view your device today.” 

T he word was, with all the im- 
plications of its past tense, sent 
a chill creeping through Ty. 

“Where is Demonstration Chief 
Arthur Mial?” demanded the Lab- 
urti Observer. 

“I don’t know!” 

The two Laburti stood still. The 
silence went on in the room, and on 
until it began to seem to roar in 
Ty’s ears. He swayed a little on his 
feet, longing to sit down, but know- 
ing enough of protocol not to do so 
while the Laburti Observer was still 
standing. Then, finally, the Obser- 
ver spoke again. 

“You have been demonstrating 



AN OUNCE OF EMOTION 



103 




JWT instrument to the ( hedal,” he 
said, “previous to the scheduled 
Demonstration and without consult- 
ing us.” 

Ty opened his mouth, then closed 
it again. There was nothing he could 

•ay. 

The Observer turned and spoke 
to the Consul with his translator 
switched off. The Consul produced 
a roll of paper-like material almost 
identical with that the Chedal had 
handed Ty earlier, and passed it in- 
to Ty’s hands. 

‘‘Now,” said the Laburti Observer, 
tonelessly, “you will give a previous 
Demonstration to me. ” 

The Demonstration was just end- 
ing, when a distant hooting called 
the Laburti Consul out of the room. 
He returned a minute later — and 
with him was Mial. 

“A Demonstration?” asked Mial, 
speaking first and looking at the 
Laburti Observer. 

“You were not to be found,” re- 
plied the alien. “And I am informed 
of a Demonstration you gave the 
Chedal Observer some hours past.” 
“Yes,” said Mial. His eyes were 
still dark from lack of sleep, but 
his gaze seemed sharp enough. That 
gaze slid over to fasten on Ty, now. 
“Perhaps we’d better discuss that, 
before the official Demonstration. 
There’s less than an hour left.” 
“You intend still to hold the ori- 
ginal Demonstration?” 

“Yes,” said Mial. “Perhaps we’d 
better discuss that, too — silone.” 
“Perhaps we had better,” said the 
Laburti. He nodded to the Consul 
who started out of the room. Ty 
stood still. 



“Get going,” said Mial icily to 
him, without bothering to turn off 
his translator collar. “And have the 
machine ready to go.” 

T y turned off his own translator 
collar, but stood where he was. 
“What’re you up to?” he demand- 
ed. “This isn’t the way we were 
supposed to do things. You’re run- 
ning some scheme of your own. 
Admit it!” 

Mial turned his collar off. 

“All right,” he said, coldly and 
calmly. “I’ve had to. There was fac- 
tors you don’t know anything about.” 
“Such as?” 

“There’s no time to explain now.” 
“I won’t go until I know what 
kind of a deal you’ve been cooking 
up with the Chedal Observer!” 
“You fool!” hissed Mial. “Can’t 
you see this alien’s listening and 
watching every change your face 
makes? I can’t tell you now, and I 
won’t tell you. But I’ll tell you this 
— you’re going to get your chance 
to demonstrate Annie just the way 
you expected to, to Chedal and Lab- 
urti together, if you go along with 
me. But fight me — and that chance 
is lost. Now, will you go?" 

Ty hesitated a moment longer, 
then he turned and followed the 
Laburti Consul out. The alien led 
him to the room where Annie and 
their baggage had been placed, and 
shut him in there. 

Once alone, he began to pace the 
floor, fury and worry boiling to- 
gether inside him. Mial’s last words 
just now had been an open ulti- 
matum. You* re too late to stop me 
now, had been the unspoken message 



104 



IF 




behind those words. Go along with 
me now, or else lose everything, 
Mial had been clever, He had 
managed to keep Ty completely in 
the dark. Puzzle as he would now, 
Ty could not figure out what it was, 
specifically, that Mial had set out 
secretly to do to the Annie Mission. 

Or how much of that Mial might 
already have accomplished. How 
could Ty fight, completely ignorant 
of what was going on? 

No, Mial was right. Ty could not 
refuse, blind, to do what he had 
been sent out to do. That way there 
would be no hope at all. By going 
along with Mial he kept alive the 
faint hope that things might yet, 
somehow, turn out as planned back 
on Earth. Even if — Ty paused in 
his pacing to smile grimly — Mial’s 
plan included some arrangement not 
to Ty’s personal benefit. For the 
sake of the original purpose of the 
Mission, Ty had to go through with 
the Demonstration, even now, just 
as if he was Mial’s willing accom- 
plice. 

B ut — Ty began to pace again. 

There was something else to 
think about. It was possible to at- 
tack the problem from the other 
end. The accomplishment of the Mis- 
sion was more important than the 
survival of Ty. Well, then, it was 
also more important than the sur- 
vival of Mial — And if Mial should 
die, whatever commitments he had 
secretly made to the Chedal against 
the Laburti, or vice-versa, would die 
with him. 

What would be left would be only 
what had been intended in the first 



place. The overwhelming common- 
sense practicality of peace in pre- 
ference to ww, demonstrated to both 
the Laburti and the Chedal. 

Ty, pausing once more in his 
pacing to make a final decision, 
found his decision already made. 
Annie was already prepared as a 
lethal weapon. All he needed was to 
put her to use to stop Mial. 

Twenty minutes later, the Laburti 
Consul for the human race came to 
collect both Ty and Annie, and bring 
them back to the room from which 
Ty had been removed, at Mial’s 
suggestion earlier. Now, Ty saw the 
room held not only Mial and the 
Laburti Observer, but one other 
Laburti in addition. While across the 
room’s width from these, were the 
Chedal Observer in blue harness 
with two other Chedals. They were 
all, with the exception of Mial, 
aliens, and their expressions were 
almost unreadable therefore. But, as 
Ty stepped into the room, he felt 
the animosity, like a living force, be- 
tween the two groups of aliens in 
spite of the full room’s width of 
distance between them. 

It was in the rigidity with which 
both Chedal and Laburti figures 
stood. It was in the unwinking gaze 
they kept on each other. For the 
first time, Ty realized the need be- 
hind the emphasis on protocol and 
careful procedure between these two 
races. Here was merely a situation 
to which protocol was new, with a 
weaker race standing between rep- 
resentatives of the two Great Ones. 
But these robed, or yellow-furred, 
diplomats seemed ready to fly physi- 
cally at each other’s throats.

44/^et it working — ** it was the 
voice of Mial with his trans- 
lator turned off, and it betrayed a 
sense of the same tension in the air 
that Ty had recognized between the 
two alien groups. Ty reached for 
his own collar and then remembered 
that it was still turned off from be- 
fore. 

“I’ll need your help,” he said 
tonelessly. “Annie’s been jarred a 
bit, bringing her here.” 

“All right,” said Mial. He came 
quickly across the room to join Ty, 
now. standing beside the statistical 
analysis instrument. 

“Stand here, behind Annie,” said 
Ty “so you don’t block my view of 
the front instrument panel. Reach 
over the case to the data sorting key 



here, and hold it down for me.” 

“This key — all right.” From be- 
hind Annie, Mial’s long right arm 
reached easily over the top of the 
case, but — as Ty had planned — 
not without requiring the other man 
to lean forward and brace himself 
with a hand upon the top of the 
metal case of the instrument. A touch 
now by Ty on the tape control key 
would send upwards of thirteen 
thousand volts suddenly through 
Mial’s body. 

He ducked his head down and 
hastily began to key in data from 
the statistic roll lying waiting for 
him on a nearby table. 

The work his face hidden, 
but could not halt the trembling be- 
ginning to grow inside him. His re- 
action against the other man was no 
less, but now — faced with the 



106 



IF 




key — he found all his history and 
environmental training against what 
he was about to do. Murder 
— screamed his conscious mind — 
ifll be murder! 

His throat ached and was dry as 
some seared and cindered landscape 
of Earth might one day be after the 
lashing of a Chedal space-based 
weapon. His chest muscles had 
tensed and it seemed hard to get 
his breath. With an internal gasp of 
panic, he realized that the longer he 
hesitated, the harder it would be. 
His finger touched and trembled 
against the smooth, cold surface of 
the tape control key, even as the 
fingers of his other hand continued 
to key in data. 

“How much longer?” hissed hfial 
in his ear. 



A his face hidden. One look at 
that face would be enough to warn 
Mial. 

What if you're wrong? — 
screamed his mind. It was a thought 
he could not afford to have, not 
with the future of the Earth and all 
its people riding on this moment. He 
swallowed, closed his eyes, and jam- 
med sideways on the tape key with 
his finger. He felt it move under his 
touch. 

He opened his eyes. There had 
been no sound. 

He lifted his gaze and saw MiaPs 
face only inches away staring down 
at him. 

“What’s the matter?” whispeied 
Mial, tearingly. 

Nothing had happened. Somehow 
Mial was still alive. Ty swallowed

and get his inner trembling under 
control. 

“Nothing ...” he said. 

“What is the cause ot this con- 
versation?” broke in the deep, yam- 
mering. translated voice of one of 
the Laburti. “Is there a difficulty 
with the device?” 

“Is there?” hissed Mial. 

“No . ” Ty pulled himself to- 
gether. “rU handle it now. You can 
go back to them.” 

“All right,” said Mial, abruptly 
straightening up and letting go of 
the case. 

He turned and went back to join 
the Laburti Observer. 

Ty turned back to his work and 
went on to produce his tape of sta- 
tistical forecasts for both races. 
Standing in the center of the room 
to explain it, while the two alien 
groups held copies of the tape, he 
found his voice growing harsher as 
he talked. 

But he made no attempt to 
moderate it. He had failed to stop 
Mial. Nothing mattered now. 

These were Annie’s results, he 
thought, and they were correct and 
undeniable. The two alien races 
could ignore them only at the cost 
of cutting off their noses to spite 
their faces. Whatever else would 
come from.Mial’s scheming and ac- 
tions here — this much from Annie 
was unarguable. No sane race could 
ignore it. 

When he finished, he dropped the 
tape brusquely on top of Annie’s 
case and looked directly at Mial. The 
dark-haired man’s eyes met his, un- 
read ably. 

108 



“You’ll go back and wait,” said 
Mial, barely moving his lips. The 
Laburti Consul glided toward Ty. 
Together they left and returned to 
the room with the baggage, where 
Ty had been kept earlier. 

“Your device will be here in a 
moment,” said the Laburti, leaving 
him. And, in fact, a moment later 
a mech moved into the room, de- 
posited Annie on the floor and with- 
drew. Like a man staring out of a 
daze, Ty fell feverishly upon the side 
panel of the metal case and began 
unscrewing the wing nuts securing it. 

T he panel fell away in his hands 
and he laid it aside. He stared 
into the inner workings before him, 
tracing the connections to the power 
supply, the data control key, and the 
case that he had made earlier. There 
were the wires, exactly as he had 
fitted them in; and there had been 
no lack of power evident in Annie’s 
regular working. Now, with his fore- 
finger half an inch above the insu- 
lation of the wires, he traced them 
from the data control key back to 
the negative power lead connection, 
and from the case toward its con- 
nection, with the positive power 
lead. 

He checked, motionless, with 
pointing finger. The connection was 
made to the metal case, all right; 
but the other end of the wire lay 
limply along other connections, un- 
attached to the power lead. He had 
evidently, simply forgotten to make 
that one, final, and vital connection. 

Forgotten . ? His finger began 
to tremble. He dropped down limply 
on the seat-surface facing Annie. 

IF 




He had not forgotten. Not just 
. forgotten. A man did not forget 
something like that. It was a life- 
time’s moral training against murder, 
that had tripped him up. And his 
squeamishness would, in the long 
run, probably cost the lives of every- 
one alive on Earth at this moment. 

He was sitting — staring at his 
hands, when the sound of the door 
gening brought him to his feet. He 
whirled about to see Mial. 

It was not yet too late. The thought 
raced through his brain as all his 
muscles tensed. He could still try to 
kill the other man with his bare 
hands — and that was a job where 
his civilized upbringing could not 
trip him up. He shifted his weight 
on to his forward foot preparatory 
to hurling himself at Mial’s throat. 
But before he could act, Mial spoke. 

“Well,” said the dark-haired man, 
harshly, “we did it.” 

Ty froze checked by the 

single small word, we. 

“We?” He stared at Mial, “did 
^at?” 

“What do you think? The Che- 
dal and the Laburti are going to 
agree — they’ll sign a pact for the 
equivalent of a hundred and twenty- 
five years of peaceful cooperation, 
provided matters develop according 
to the instrument’s estimates. 
They’ve got to check with their re- 
spective governments, of course, but 
that’s only a formality — ” he broke 
off, his face tightening suspiciously. 
“What’s wrong with you?” His gaze 
went past Ty to the open side of 
Annie. 

“What’s wrong with the instni- 
ment?” 



C4Tn^othing,” said Ty. His head 
was whirling and he felt an 
insane urge to break out laughing. 
“ — Annie just didn’t kill you, that’s 
aU.” 

“Kill me?” Mial’s face paled, then 
darkened. “You were going to kiH 
me — with that?” He pointed at 
Annie. 

“I was going to send thirteen 
thousand volts through you while 
you were helping me with the De- 
monstration,” said Ty, still light- 
headed, “ — if I hadn’t crossed my- 
self up. But you tell me it’s all right, 
anyway. You say the aliens’re going 
to agree.” 

“You thought they wouldn’t?” said 
Mial, staring at him. 

“I thought you were playing soma 
game of your own. You said you 
were.” 

“That’s right,” said Mial. Some of 
the dark color faded from his face. 
“I was. I had to. You couldn’t be 
trusted.” 

“/ couldn’t be trusted?” Ty burst 
out. 

“Not you — or any of your 
bunch!” Mial laughed, harshly. 
“Babes in the woods, all of you. 
You build a machine that proves 
peace pays better than war, and 
think that settles the problem. What 
would have happened without some- 
one like me along — ” 

“You! How they let someone like 
you weasel your way in — ” 

“Why you don’t think I was as- 
signed to this mission through any 
kind of accident, do you?” Mial 
laughed in Ty’s face. “They combed 
the world to find someone like me.” 

“Combed the world? Why?” 



AN OUNCE OF EMOTION 



lOf 




^^Because you had to come, and 
tbc Laburti would only allow two 
, of us with the analyzer to make the 
trip,” said Mial. "You were the best 
Operator. But you were no politician 
— and no actor. And there was no 
time to teach you the facts of life. 
The only way to make it plain to 
the aliens that you were at cross 
purposes with me was to pick some- 
one to head this Mission whom you 
couldn’t help fighting.” 

"Couldn’t help fighting?” Ty stood 
torn with fury and disbelief. "Why 
should I have someone along I 
couldn’t help fighting — ” 

"So the aliens would believe me 
when I told them your faction back 
on Earth was strong enough so that 
I had to carry on the real negotia- 
tions behind your back.” 

"What — real negotiations?” 
"Negotiations,” said Mial, "to de- 
cide whose side we with our Annie- 
machines and their Operators would 
be on, during the hundred and 
twenty-five years of peace between 
the Great Races.” Mial smiled sar- 
donically at Ty. 

4 40ide?” Ty stood staring at the 
other man. "Why should we 
be on anyone’s side?” 

"Why, because by manipulating 
the data fed to the analyzers, we 
can control the pattern of growth; 
so that the Chedal can gain three 
times as fast as the Laburti in a 
given period, or the Laburti gain 
at the same rate over the Chedal. 
Of course,” said Mial, dryly, "I 
didn’t ever exactly promise we could 
do that in so many words, but they 
got the idea. Of course, it was the 



Laburti we had to close with — but 
I dickered with the Chedal first to 
get the Laburti price up.” 

"What price?” 

"Better relationships, more travel 
between the races.” 

"But — ” Ty stammered. "It’s not 
true! That about- manipulating the 
data.” 

"Of course it’s not true!” snapped 
Mial. "And they never would have 
believed it if they hadn’t seen you — 
the neutralist — fighting me like a 
Kilkenny cat.” Mial stared at him. 
"Neither alien bunch ever thought 
seriously about not going to war 
anyway. They each just considered 
putting it off until they could go 
into it with a greater advantage over 
the other.” 

"But — they can’t prefer war to 
peace!” 

Mial made a disgusted noise in 
his throat. 

"You amateur statesmen!” he said. 
"You build a better mousetrap and 
you think that’s all there is to it. 
Just because something’s better for 
individuals, or races, doesn’t mean 
they’ll automatically go for it. The 
Chedal and Laburti have a reason 
for going to war that can’t be fig- 
ured on your Annie-machine.” 

"What?” Ty was stung. 

"It’s called the emotional factor,” 
said Mial, grimly. "The climate of 
feeling that exists between the Che- 
dal and the Laburti races — like the 
climate between you and me.” 

Ty found his gaze locked with the 
other man’s. He opened his mouth 
to speak — then closed it again. A 
cold, electric shock of knowledge 
seemed to flow through him. Of

IF 




course, if the Laburti felt about the 
Chedal as he felt about Mial . 

All at once, things fell together 
for him, and he saw the true picture 
with painfully clear eyes. But the 
sudden knowledge was a tough pill 
to get down. He hesitated. 

“But you’ve just put off war a 
hundred and twenty-five years!” he 
said. “And both alien races’ll be 
twice as strong, then!” 

4 4 A nd we’ll be forty times as 
strong as we are now,” said 
Mial, dryly. “What do you think a 
nearly three per cent growth advan- 
tage amounts to, compounded over 
a hundred and twenty-five years? By 
that time we’ll be strong enough to 
hoid the balance of power between 
them and force peace, if we want 
it. They’d like to cut each other’s 
throats, all right, but not at the cost 
of cutting their own, for sure. Be- 
sides,” he went on, more slowly, “if 
your peace can prove itself in that 
length of time — now’s its chance 
to do it.” 

He fell silent. Ty stood, feeling 
betrayed and ridiculed. All the time 
he had been suspecting Mial, the 
other man had been working clear- 
eyed toward the goal. For if the 
Laburti and the Chedal felt as did 
he and Mial, the unemotional calm 



sense of Annie’s forecast never 
would have convinced the aliens to 
make peace. 

Ty saw Mial watching him now 
with a sardonic smile. He thinks I 
haven’t got the guts to congratulate 
him, thought Ty. 

“All right,” he said, out loud. 
“You did a fine job — in spite of 
me. Good for you.” 

“Thanks,” said Mial grimly. They 
looked at each other. 

“But — ” said Ty, after a minute, 
between his teeth, the instinctive 
venom in him against the other man 
rushing up 'behind his words, “I 
still hate your guts! Once I thought 
there was a way out of that, but 
you’ve convinced me different, as 
far as people like us are concerned. 
Once this is over, I hope to heaven 
I never set eyes on you again!” 

Their glances met nakedly. 

“Amen,” said Mial softly. “Be- 
cause next time Vll kill you.” 

“Unless I beat you to it,” said Ty. 

Mial looked at him a second long- 
er, then turned and quit the room. 
From then on, and all the way back 
to Earth they avoided each other’s 
company and did not speak again. 
For there was no need of any more 
talk. 

They understood each other very 
well. END

AN OUNCE OF EMOTIOli 



U1 




IF ♦ Short Story 




by ROBERT MOORE WILLIAAAS 



The child was obviously 
imagining things. But her 
wildest dreams came truel 



Jim Eiler entered the bed- 
room, he saw that Marta was 
stretched full-length in the anti-grav- 
ity energies flowing upward over the 
mattress of her bed. She sprawled 
there in the careless abandon of a 
person who had dropped all of the 
world’s cares, at least for one night, 
the cords from the sleep machine 
looping down to her head from the 
elastic holder at the top of the bed. 
His first impulse was to turn off the 
sleep machine and awaken her, his 
second impulse was to let sleeping 
wives lie. 

Glancing through the one-way-vi- 
sion glass into the next room, he 
saw that Nelda was also sprawled 
in the same careless abandon as 
her mother, but that one cord from 
the sleep machine had slipped down 
around her neck. Entering the room, 
he put the cord back into place on 
her head. At three years, Nelda was 
still a complete exhibitionist, and 



insisted on sleeping nude, an im- 
pulse which her mother encouraged 
in the child. 

Back in the bedroom, he slipped 
out of his street clothes and into 
his pajamas. With one hand, he 
fitted the cords from the sleep ma- 
chine to his head, with the other 
he adjusted the anti-gravity energies 
for his bed. 

Always, this moment when the 
anti-grav lifted him, was pure de- 
light, a floating feeling that was 
heaven come to earth. The anti- 
gravity energies did not work on the 
surface of the body, there was no 
felt effect on the skin. Instead, they 
worked inside the body, lifting there, 
but they did not produce their effect 
at the level of the muscles, the 
blood, the bones, but worked instead 
at the atomic levels out of which 
muscles, blood, and bones were con- 
structed. The result of this was in- 
stant body relaxation. 



112 




J!m Eiler savored die bliss of 
taxation, let it seep through every 
muscle, through the nervous system 
and down to the marrow of his 
bones, it seemed. Then, with the 
slightest use of energy, he turned 
on the sleep machine. 

If sprawling in the anti-gravity 
energies was heaven, turning on the 
sleep machine was paradise. He al- 
ways had the vague impression just 
at this point that blessed angel wings 
materialized under him, and that as 
they lifted him up, he slipped away 
into some paradise of wonderful de- 
light. 

Finding the button of the sleep 
machine, he gently pressed it. 

“Hi!” a voice said, inside his head. 

G one instantly was the feeling of 
angel wings bearing him aloft 
to paradise, gone was the feeling of 
relaxation so complete it extended 
to the marrow of his bones. With 
one hand, he turned off the anti- 
grav, with the other he cut off the 
sleep machine. Deprived of its sup- 
port, his body hit the foam rubber 
mattress of the bed with a jolt. He 
sat up. 

“Who is it?” he demanded. “Who 
are you? What are you doing here 
in my bedroom?” 

He was utterly sure that someone 
was present in the room and had 
spoken to him. 

On the adjoining bed, Marta’s 
body jerked spasmodically at the 
sound of his voice. Then she reached 
frantically for the controls of the 
anti-gravity energies and the sleep 
machine. Her body thumped into 
the mattress as the anti-gravity en- 



ergies went off. Startled, shaken, and 
on the way to getting mad, Marta 
sat up. 

“Who is it?” she demanded. Then 
she saw her husband. “Did you 
awaken me? Can’t you come in one 
night without waking half of the 
apartment building?” Across the cen- 
turies, science had made enormous 
advances in every field except wom- 
en, who remained female. 

“Somebody spoke to me,” Jim 
said. 

“In our bedroom somebody spoke 
to you?” Marta asked. Pulling her 
robe around her, she was getting 
to her feet. “How much did you 
have to drink?” 

“Three cans of beer,” he answer- 
ed. “And I’m not drunk.” 

“All right, all right, so you’re 
sober! But I was right here in the 
bedroom too and I didn’t hear any- 
body speak,” Marta answered, dis- 
appearing into the bathroom. 

“You were asleep!” Jim shouted 
through the door. 

Coming out of the bathroom, she 
went into the nursery, to see about 
Nelda, then returned to the bed- 
room. Her attitude said she had two 
small children on her hands. She 
glanced sharply at the child who was 
supposed to be her husband. 

“Lie down, dear, and get some 
sleep,” she said. “Fm sure you’ll 
feel better in the morning. If not, 
you can call Harold for an appoint- 
ment — ” 

“Harold is a psychiatrist — ” Jim 
began, outrage in his voice. 

“He’s also a friend of the fam- 
ily,” Marta answered. “You can 
talk to him about this voice.”

“I’m not crazy I” he exclaimed. 

“Of course not, dear. Whoever 
said you were? I’m sure many 
people have to see a psychiatrist 
sometime or other in their life. 
It’s nothing to be ashamed of.” 

“I’m not going to see — ” 

44 \‘\\ right, all right! I don’t 
wish to argue with you 
about it,” Marta said, resignation 
in her voice. “Lie down and get 
some rest.” 

“Stop treating me like a child!” 

“Then stop acting like one!” 
Marta said. Slipping off her robe, 
she settled herself in the anti- 
gravity energies and turned on her 
sleep machine. 

Doubt, like a black cloud, was 
in Jim Eller’s mind. Had the sleep 
machine produced the voice he 
was certain he had heard? Every- 
body used sleep machines. They 
were considered to be the greatest 
discovery of the twenty-first cen- 
tury. So far as he knew, no bad 
effects had ever been reported from 
the use of these devices. Replac- 
ing barbiturates, narcotics, and oth- 
er drugs, used with the anti-grav- 
ity energies, the sleep machines 
were considered to be the only 
device that permitted the human 
race to face and overcome the 
stress pressures of its vastly over- 
civilized world. With doubt strong 
in his mind, Eiler laid down and 
turned on the anti-gravity energies. 
Then, reluctantly, he turned on the 
sleep machine. 

“Hi, Jim,” the voice said. “Hi!” 

For a time, he found the strength 
of will to listen, then he fled to the 



couch in the living room, to spend 
the balance of the night there with- 
out benefit of the sleep machine 
or the anti-gravity energies. He 
got no sleep at all. 

The next morning, his first step 
was to call his company and get 
permission to take the day off. His 
second step was to take the sleep 
machine to the agency that handled 
these devices. 

“Sure, we’ll look at it,” the 
technician there told him. “But 
these machines simply do not go 
wrong.’’ 

The tone of the technician’s 
voice said that if anything was 
wrong, it was the customer’s head. 

He went directly from the sleep 
machine agency to the office of 
the psychiatrist. 

“I use a sleep machine myself,” 
the psychiatrist said. “I don’t hear 
any voices.” 

“It’s either the sleep machine or 
it’s me,” Eiler said. “May I use 
your phone?” 

“Sure.” 

“Everything checks out perfect- 
ly,” the technician at the sleep 
machine agency said. “It’s 100% 
okay. You can pick it up any 
time.” 

Desperation was in Jim Eiler’s 
voice when he spoke to the psy- 
chiatrist. “Will you come by our 
apartment tonight? In spite of what 
the technician said, there is some- 
thing wrong with my sleep ma- 
chine. I want you to come by and 
help me check it out. Also, it will 
be a load off Marta’s mind.” 

“Well — I wouldn’t do anything 
like this for a patient — ” the psy- 



114 



IF 




chiatiist said. ‘^But for a friend — ** 
He smiled at Jim Eiler. 

“Come for cocktails and din- 
ner,” Eiler said. He was enor- 
mously relieved. “Marta will love 
having you.” 

at night Nelda went to bed 
early, a proceeding which 
disgusted her enormously. She 
wanted to stay up and talk to the 
big man whom her parents called 
Doc. She found him very fascin- 
ating. Only after they were sure 
she was sound asleep did her par- 
ents tiptoe into their bedroom. Doc 
accompanied them. 

“ril lie down and turn on the 
anti-gravity energies,” Jim Eiler 
said. “Then I’ll turn on the sleep 
machine. If I hear anything, Til 
let you take my place. What’s 
that?” 

A shout of glee had come from 
the nursery. Turning his head, he 
glanced thix)ugh the one-way glass. 
In there, he could see Nelda. She 
had climbed out of bed. 

“Dam it — ^Now we’ll have to 
wait.” Jim said. “Whatever else 
happens, I don’t want her to get 
the suspicion that her father is 
nuts.” 

“You don’t need to worry about 
that,” Harold said. “She suspects 
you’re nuts now. By the time she 
reaches her teens, she’ll be sure of 
it. But what is she playing with in 
there?” 

“Some imaginary play creature 
that she calls Cedric,” Marta said, 
unconcerned. “She has played with 
him ever since she was a tiny 
baby.” 



“An imaginary play creature?" 
Sudden interest was in the psy- 
chiatrist’s voice. “Yes. Go on.” 

“Surely you don’t think the play 
of a child is important!” Marta 
protested. “We all played imagin- 
ary games when we were small.” 

“I’m not sure we don’t keep bn 
playing them when we grow up!” 
The psychiatrist’s voice grew testy. 
“Only then we think of them as 
real.” 

“But—” 

“I came out here because Jim 
thinks an imaginary creature talks 
to him through his sleep machine. 
Now I discover you have a child 
who plays games with an imagin- 
ary creature, and not only plays 
with him, but sees and talks to 
him. LooL’” 

Wearing soft white flannel pa- 
jamas with the three little pigs 

done on them in red embroidery, 
Nelda was out of bed and was ob- 
viously playing hide and seek with 
some creature she seemed to sec 
but which was not visible to the 
three adults watching from the 

adjoining bedroom. While they 
watched, she searched carefully 
around the nursery. Walking on 

tip-toe, she moved to her bed. 

Bending double, she looked under 
it. She checked the closet of her 
room, using great care and caution 
in opening the door and peering in- 
side. 

“She’s looking for something,” 
the psychiatrist said. “The question 
is — what?” 

“Maybe it is the same thing that 
talked to me through my sleep 
machine last night,” Jim said. 




SHORT TRIP TO NOV/HERE 



115 




“Look!” the psychiatrist said, 
pointing. 

I n the corner of the room, in the 
space behind the end of the 
doll cabinet and the wall, Nelda 
had found something. With squeals 
of glee, she grabbed this something 
and danced around the room. 

“Now I’ll hide,” the\ heard her 
say when the dance vas over. 
“You be it and hunt me.” 

While the parents stared trans- 
fixed and the psychiatrist hardly 
dared to breathe, Nelda slipped in- 
to the closet. When the door had 
closed behind her, the three adults 
saw something move in the nur- 
sery. Simultaneously, all three 
pointed toward it. 

It was a shadow, or a shadow 
of a shadow. 

“A sprite!” Marta whispered. 
“Peter Pan himself!” 

“The idea of Peter Pan must 
have originated from some real 
situation,” the psychiatrist said. 
“These stories are not just whim- 
sy They have roots in something. 
And all of those stories of lost 
children that never seem to find 
thei: way home, the children the 
gypsies are said to have taken, the 
changelings. There’s a vast folk- 
lore—” 

“This is 2010,” Jim said, harsh- 
ly “Folklore is out of date.” 
“Folklore may be out of date 
but nobody has told its creatures!” 
Marta said. 

The shadow they were watching 
did look a little like Peter Pan. He 
also looked like any of the Seven 
Dwarts, a little, except for the 



pointed ears that were vaguely 
visible on his forehead. Or were 
they horns? His face was round* 
with the smile of a happy gamia 
on it. As to clothing perhaps yes* 
perhaps no. So misty was the out- 
line, so dim was the figure that it 
was not possible to make certain 
about the clothes. 

Beyond the glass, the three adults 
watched an elaborate game of hide 
and seek. The sprite looked under 
the covers of the bed, hunting cau- 
tiously there. From inside the closet 
came a giggle of pure happiness, 
indicating Nelda was peeking 
through a crack in the door. The 
sprite heard the giggle. It cocked 
its head as it listened to the sound, 
then went directly away from the 
closet. 

“Last night he was talking to me 
about the mathematics of his 
world,” Jim said. “Tonight he’s 
playing games with Nelda!” 

“You play games with her,” Mar- 
ta said. “And you understand high- 
er math!” 

Jim was silent. 

In the nursery, the sprite had de- 
cided to open the closet. Sudden- 
ly, he shoved against it. At the same 
time Nelda pushed from the inside, 
so that the door was flung open, 
upsetting the sprite. With great 
shouts of happy joy, Nelda ran 
past him and into the living room. 
Leaping to his feet, Peter Pan ran 
after her. Still shrieking with happi- 
ness, she fled from the living room 
and into the bedroom of her par- 
ents, the sprite in mock pursuit in 
as pleasant a childhood game as 
was ever seen. 



116 



IF 




She saw her parents. And 
stopped still, staring upward at 
them and at Dr. Turner. 

Possibly she had been walking 
in her sleep. Possibly the whole 
game sequence had been a part of 
sleep-walking activity. The sight of 
her parents awakened her, sur- 
prised her, caused her to cry out in 
sudden fear. Then she began to 
whimper. 

Instantly, the game changed. At 
the first sound of her whimper, the 
sprite leaped in front of her. There 
he became a menacing, protective 
shadow. Facing the humans, he 
pointed for Nelda to run. 

Turning, Nelda ran toward the 
living room door. As she fled, she 
seemed to grow thin and insub- 
stantial. And thinner still. And 
thinner still! As if she was running 
through the frames of a motion 
picture projector replaying a fast 
fade-out, she went from seeing, 
went from hearing, went from be- 
ing, vanishing like a shadow flee- 
ing swiftly into nowhere. 

Turning, the sprite followed her, 
fled from seeing, fled from hear- 
ing, fled from being. 

In the thick silence that fol- 
lowed, Marta screamed. 

T he TV news announcer said: 
"Mr. and Mrs. James Filer re- 
ported to police late last night 
that their three-year old daughter, 
Nelda, was missing. The mother 
told police that presumably the 
child had awakened from sleep, 
had opened the front door of the 
apartment, which is on the eighth 
floor of the building, then had 



wandered down the stairs and out- 
side into the night. There was no 
evidence of a burglar or other in- 
truder in the apartment. Police are 
seeking the child in the vicinity of 
the apartment building — ” 

"But that wasn’t what hap- 
pened,” Marta told her harrassed 
husband and their equally har- 
rassed psychiatrist, for • perhaps 
the twentieth time. "She didn’t go 
down the stairs. She went — ” Un- 
able to describe what she had seen 
with her own eyes, she spread her 
hands in a helpless gesture. 

"We didn’t dare tell the truth,” 
the psychiatrist said, bitterly. "If 
we had told the police she had an 
invisible playmate who took her 
away to some unknown land, , the 
local psychiatric society would 
have me laid by the heels. W« just 
don’t believe in ghosts these days. 
Ghosts are not scientific.” 

"Scientific or not, we saw thii 
one. All of us saw it — or him,” 
Marta said. 

"If I admit that, my professional 
standing is — ” 

"Damn your professional stand- 
ing!” Jim said. "I want my daugh- 
ter!” 

"If damning my professional 
standing would get her back, I 
would be the first to damn it!” 
The psychiatrist answered, heatedly. 

"You said other children have 
vanished,” Marta said. 

"Now and then it happens.” 
"What becomes of them?” 

"Oh, they usually turn up.” 

"All of them?” 

"I don’t know. No one can an- 
swer a question like that.” 



SHORT TRIP TO NOWHERE 



117 




“What happens to the ones who 
do not return?” Marta demanded. 

“I don’t know," the psychiatrist 
answered He had no intention of 
telling her ot lost children that 
had been found dead, of little bod- 
ies hidden in rain pipes, culverts, 
and weeds. 

Jim Eiler did not go to work the 
next day. Calling his company, ne 
told them his child was missing, 
and was told by the horrified ex- 
ecutive in charge to take off as 
much time as was necessary. Dr. 
Turner called his office and told 
his secretary to cancel all appoint- 
ments until further notice. 

“I’m supposed to be the kind of 
witch doctor who can help solve 
problems like this/’ Dr. Turner 
•aid. 

A ided again by police, they 
searched the neighborhood. 
Nobody had seen a three year old 
girl dressed in white pajamas with 
little pigs done in red on them. 
Returning to their apartment, they 
waited out the day. Looking at bis 
wife, Jim saw she was near col- 
lapse. Dr. Turner was putting on a 
brave front. At this point, Jim had 
an idea. Going into the bedroom, 
he iaid down, turned on the anti- 
gravity energies, then the sleep ma- 
chine. A split second later, he sat 
up, shouting. Marta and Dr. Tur- 
ner came on the run. 

“I’ve got the sprite on the 
wire!” he said. “As soon as I 
turned on the sleep machine, he 
was waiting for me!” 

“I want to talk to him — ^ Marta 
began. 



“I’ll do the talking!” Jim an- 
swered. “There’s one tuning on the 
sleep machine — ” He had already 
turned off the anti-grav energies. 
Sitting on the edge of the mattress, 
he was carefully adjusting the diail 
of the sleep machine. “Ah!” he 
said, as the tiny piping voice came 
out of nowhere into his mind. 

“1 want my daughter back!” he 
said. “Do you understand me? I

right now!” His voice had become 
a shout without him realizing it. 
“What’s that?” 

Marta and Dr. Turner saw his 
enlarge in his haggard face as he 
listened. 

“What right have we got to 
her?” he shouted. “We’re her par- 
ents! That’s the right we have to 
her!” 

Again he listened. The anger on 
his face became bewilderment. He 
looked up at his wife. 

“He wants to know what parents 
are!” he said. “He says Nelda asks 
for her mother. What does mother 
mean?” 

“It means — ” Marta tried to 
speak and choked instead. “It 
means I carried her in my body 
for nine months! That’s part of 
what it means!” 

“He doesn’t know what that 
means, either!” Jim said. 

“You mean he doesn’t know a 
thing about sex!” Dr. Turner 
gasped. “Not a single thing!” 

Relaying messages from the vis- 
ible to the invisible world, relay- 
ing replies coming back from no- 
where, Jim Eiler listened, then 
looked at his wife.

“He says you are a complete 
barbarian, to imprison a lovely 
little person like Nelda inside your 
body for nine months!” 

M arta gulped, choked, then was 
able to speak. “Tell him 1 
didn’t imprison her — tell him she 
grew there. Tell him — Ask him 
how he came into the world!” 

“He says he has always existed, 
that he wasn’t born and that he 
won’t die!” 

“An immortal!” the psychiatrist 
gasped. 

Listening, interpreting, Jim Eiler 
spoke again. “He says he is im- 
mortal. He says this is not as won- 
derful as us silly humans think it 
would be. He says it is often very 
hard to find some new way to 
amuse himself, a new way to pass 
the time away — ” 

“Did he take Nelda to amuse 
himself?” Marta demanded, her 
voice hot. “I want her back!” 

“He says that part of his reason 
for taking her into his world was 
to have somebody to play with. He 
says another part was because he 
realized as soon as he saw us clear- 
ly that life with such ogres as we 
are was too dangerous for a sen- 
sitive child!” 

“Ogres? Me an ogre! I’ll — ” 
Marta was silent. “Where is Nel- 
da?” 

“He says she is right there with 
him,” Jim answered. 

“I want to talk to her!” 

“He says she can’t talk to you 
from his world, that she doesn’t 
know how to talk through the 
other side of the sleep machine. 



and that he hasn’t time to teach 
her.” 

“Why doesn’t he have time?” 
Marta demanded. “A minute ago 
he was complaining because time 
hangs heavy on his hands. Now 
he says he doesn’t have time to 
teach her how to talk to her 
mother through the sleep ma- 
chine!” 

“He says he has the time but 
that she doesn’t,” Jim answered. 

“What does he mean by that?’* 

“He says he could explain this 
but that we couldn’t understand his 
explanation,” Jim answered. “He 
wants to know what hungry 
means.” 

“Who’s hungry? Is Nelda hun- 
gry? Does he think she would die 
of starvation before he could teach 
her how to use the sleep machine 
to talk through? He wants us to 
tell him how to feed her so he can 
keep her there in his world?” Mar- 
ta’s voice caught. “I’ll see him in 
— ” Her voice caught again. “No, 
I won’t see him in hell, either. If 
Nelda is really hungry — tell him to 
give her a glass of milk. Tell him 
to give her a peanut butter and 
jelly sandwich. Tell him to give 
her a balanced meal, including pro- 
tein, carrots, and mixed veg- 

etables.” 

Jim, listening, stared in conster- 
nation at his wife. “He says he 
doesn’t know what these words mean 
either. He asks me what is milk, 
what is peanut butter, what are 
carrots — ” 

“Ask him what he eats,” Marta 
said. 

“He says be Hves on pure light,’*

Jim answered. Suddenly he was 
touting angrily. “Were you wait- 
mg for me here by the sleep ma- 
chine because Nelda was telling 
you she was hungry and you want- 
ed to find out the meaning of the 
word? It means she needs food. 
Damn you, feed her!” 

T he psychiatrist’s hand on his 
shoulder reminded him that 
he was talking to an invisible, un- 
reachable creature. The pressure of 
the fingers restored some measure 
of sanity to him. 

“Thanks, Doc,” he said, grate- 
fully. “But Nelda! She’ll starve to 
death! There’s no food for people 
like us over there.” 

Jim turned his attention back to 
the world beyond the sleep machine. 

“Surely there is some way to 
feed her — look around your 
world — ” He stopped speaking and 
began to adjust the dial of the 
ileep machine. His manner was 
that of a man frantically jiggling 
a telephone receiver after a con- 
nection has been broken on the 
other end. 

“I can’t get him any more,” he 
•aid. He looked at Dr. Turner. “Is 
Aere anything you can suggest?” 
The psychiatrist was silent. 

It was Marta who lifted her 
head. “I hear her!” she said. 

“Please, Marta, no auditory 
hallucinations,” the psychiatrist 
said quickly. “We got enough 
trouble without you — ” 

“I’m not imagining anything, 
Fm hearing sounds!” Marta an- 
swered. 

In the silence that followed the 



click of the larch on the front door 
of the apartment was clearly aud- 
ible. 

Click-clack, the latch went, 
click-clack, up and down, clicks 
clack, like a sound from elfin land, 
click-clack, such noises as are 
heard inside the walls of old 
houses late at night, click-clack. 
Then, impatiently, clickety-clack! 

“Somebody is trying to open the 
front door!” Jim Eilcr said. “If it’s 
that little monster — ” 

Crossing the living room, he 
jerked the door open. 

Nelda looked up at him. Her 
face was wan, her pajamas showed 
traces of hard use. As Jim snatched 
her up, she looked over his shoul- 
der at her mother, and expressed 
the nature of her complaint against 
the world. 

‘^I’m hungry, mommy. I’m 
just almost starved to death!” 

L ater, sitting on her father’s lap 
at the kitchen table, with a 
sandwich oozing red jelly and yel- 
low peanut butter firmly clutched 
in both hands, with another sand- 
wich in reserve on the table, with 
her mother urging her to have an- 
other drink of milk, with the man 
called Doc fondly beaming at her, 
she consented to answer questions. 

“I don’t know where he took 
me. I’ve played with him ever 
since I was a baby, at night, when 
you were sleeping . .” she said, 
pausing to lick at a tongue of red 
jelly seeping through from the sand- 
wich. 

“We don’t dare tell it this way,” 
the man called Doc said, over and 



120 



IF 




over again. “We’ve got to report^ to 
the police that she has returned. 
But we don’t dare tell them the 
truth. It would ruin my reputa- 
tion.” 

“How can you ruin the reputa- 
tion of a psychiatrist?” Marta 
asked, bitterly, then was hastily 
apologetic. She turned to Nelda. 
“How did you get wherever it was 
you went?” 

*‘We just walked there.” 

“Like through the walls?” 

“Yes.” The sandwich was now 
leaking peanut butter, which 
claimed her full attention. 

“And this creature who took 
you — ” 

“Do you mean Cedric? There 
he is now!” She pointed toward 
the far end of the table. 

Silence in the kitchen was in- 
stant and complete. Vaguely vis- 
iUe at the far end of the table 
was a dim shadow with pointed 
ears. 

“Have some peanut butter and 
jelly,” Nelda said, waving the rem- 
nant of the sandwich toward the 
shadow. 

Approaching the sandwich along 
the side of the table, the shadow 
seemed to sniff at it with a black, 
round nose. Then, as if this odor 
was not such a smell as was con- 
genial to him, he backed hastily 
away. 

Nelda seemed to understand this 
backing away better than the 
adults. 

“’By, Cedric,” she said “’By.” 



The shadow slid away and away 
and away. And was gone. Like the 
Chesire cat, the vague smile on 
his face seemed to linger in the 
kitchen after he was gone. 

Dr. Turner insisted he was the 
proper person to make a full re- 
port to the police. 

“As your doctor, I can tell them 
you are not in a condition to talk 
to them,” he said. 

Later, the TV news reporters 
were happy to say that three-year 
Nelda Eiler, reported as lost, had 
now turned up at home, in good 
shape except for an enormous ap- 
petite. The physician of the par- 
ents — according to the broadcast — 
said she had apparently simply 
strayed away into the neighbor- 
hood, then, when she had gotten 
quite hungry, had strayed back 
home. 

With this fiction, the police and 
the television news reporters were 
content. 

Now and then Jim Eiler, mov- 
ing back toward wakefulness in 
the sleep machine, seems to hear 
shouts from the direction of the 
nursery, as of happy children at 
play there in the quiet night. 
Drowsily remembering how it was 
with him when he was a child, he 
advances the controls of the sleep 
machine another notch, and goes 
back to sleep. Whether children are 
actually at play in Nelda’s nursery, 
he never knows. 

And he makes very sure he never 
finds out! END

Illustrated by MORROW 



He s/ew a galaxy to save the 
life of his deadliest enemyl 



E ven though the Llurdi had 
been absolute rulers of all the 
planets of the Jelmi for many 
thousands of years, it was easy for 
them to accept, and to adopt them- 
selves to, the new condition of co- 
existence with the Realm of the 
Jelmi on terms of equality. That 
was the way they were built. 

The llanzian fed the new data 



into Computer Prime and issued 
its findings as a directive. Since 
this directive was the product oi 
pure logic, that was all there wai 
to it. 

With the Jelmi, however, even 
with a much simpler and easier 
agenda, things were distinctly oth- 
erwise. Everyone knows how dif- 
ficult it is to change the political

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE — 

The deadliest enemies in the universe are Richard Seaton 
and Marc C. DuQuesne . but they have patched together their 
feud in order to join forces against strange enemies from another 
galaxy. 

Seaton enters the partnership with open eyes. He knows 
that Blackie DuQuesne is his enemy. But he also knows that, next 
to Seaton himself, DuQuesne is the ablest human being alive — 
and his brains and fighting fury will be needed. DuQuesne, on 
the other hand, had lost to Seaton too many times to risk a move 
against him now — until he has made sure of having every ad- 
vantage he can get. it is not morality that keeps him from an 
attempt to stab Seaton in the back. It is pure prudence. 

But when he meets the race called the Jelmi, and learns 
from them the secret of the ''gizmo'' — the fourth-dimensional trans- 
lator which permits him to strike anywhere in the universe without 
warning — he strikes. His attempt fails, but now Seaton's enemies 
are multiplied. Against him are arrayed the strange winged lizards 
called the LIurdi, the deadly halogen-breathing Chlorans — and 
DuQuesne. 

But on the lost planet of Ray-See-Nee, in thrall to the 
Chlorans from time immemorial, Seaton has been discovered by 
two women with a Power that may yet redress the balance in his 
favor — if they reveal it to him, and if he learns to use it in time. 

For in this struggle galaxies are arrayed against galaxies, count- 
less billions of human dnd non-human creatures strive against each 
other . and not even the giant mechanical Brain of Seaton's 
Skylark can control these forces without the Power. 

But Seaton is engaged by fierce LIurdian forces. While he 
is battling to defend his ship against their onslaught, a voice 
speaks to him— in English!

er. Each would have its own way 
in setting up the Realm or there 
would be no Realm — it would pick 
up its marbles and go home. 

Fortunately, however, the eight 
hundred best brains of the entire 
Jelman race were together in one 
place — in the fully (^erative base 
that the MalUdaxian*s dome had 
now become. Their numbers in- 
cluded the most capable and most 
highly trained specialists in every 
field of Jelman endeavor and they 
all had been living together and 
working together for many 
months. 

They knew better ^an to go off 
half cocked. They woidd have to 
develop a master-plan \xpon which 
they could all agree. Unanimously. 
Nothing less would do. Having de- 
veloped such a plan they would 
put it into effect, eadi person or 
planetary group upon his or her or 
their home world. The constitution 
thus fabricated would be put into 
effect by reason if possiUe, by 
force if necessary. It was not to 
be amended except by process con- 
tained within itself. 

Thus the Constitutional Commit- 
tee of Eight Hundred was st31 liv- 
ing in the base and was stdl hard 
at work when the Officer of the 
Day called Mergon — who, after 
glancing at plates and instruments, 
called Luloy. 

T ie ether was showing strains of 
a magnitude not observed since 
die Battle for Independence. A Llurd 
diip was putting out everything he 
had; fighting full-out against a — 
gomething — whose battle-screen cov- 



ered such an immensity of space 
that Mergon could scarcely believe 
his instruments. 

Luloy quirked an eyebrow. **Well, 
what are we waiting for?" 

“Nothing,” and Mergon, who 
could now handle projections through 
the fourth dimension, launched 
them. “I’ll keep us invisible while 
we see what that thing is and how 
big it really is.” 

They went and saw — and the 
more they studied the immensity 
that was the Skylark of Vdieron the 
more they marveled, finally, in the 
Valeron*s control room and still in- 
visible, they studied the worldlet’s 
personnel; the while talking to each 
other in the flesh at the MaUidax- 
ian*s main panel. 

“Except for the green-skinned cou- 
ple they are Tellurians," the girl 
insisted. “Everything abrat that — 
that ship, if you can cidl it a ship — 
is Tellurian. Just look at those 
clothes. You never saw anything 
like that anywhere except on Telliis 
and you never will.” 

“We never heard anything about 
anything like that mobile fortress on 
Tell us, either,” he objected, "and we 
certainly would have if they*d known 
anything about it. How could they 
hide it?” 

“Maybe it’s so new that not too 
many people know about it yet. 
Anyway, whatever the truth about 
that, we heard a lot about Seaton 
and Crane. Especially Seaton. Ac- 
cording to the lore, he’s their prin- 
cipal god’s right-hand man. He can 
do anything'* 

“Or a devil’s, depending on who 
you talked to. But we wrote that

off as just that — lore. If not prop- 
aganda.” 

“We’ll have to write it back on 
again. Those two have to be Seaton 
and Crane — there, the Jelm-sized 
one with his head in the controller, 
and that other bean-pole type stand- 
ing there smoking a ... a cigarette, 
they call it. And that smoking busi- 
ness clinches it. Nobody but Tellur- 
ians burn their lungs out with 
smoke.” 

“Okay.” Mergon thickened their 
projections up to full visibility and 
spoke: 

“You must be the Seatons and the 
Cranes, about whom we heard so 
much on Earth but whom we were 
not able to find.” 

C rane the Imperturbable was start- 
led out of his imperturbability 
when Mergon and Luloy appeared in 
the Valeron*s control room and Mer- 
gon spoke to him in English. But he 
did not show it — very much! — and 
realized in a moment what the truth 
was. 

“We are,” Crane said, stepping 
forward and holding out his hand. 
These people would understand the 
gesture. “I’m M. Reynolds Crane; 
Doctor Seaton is occupied at the 
moment. You are of course the peo- 
ple who had the spaceship on the 
moon. We have come all the way 
out here in the hope of finding you 
somewhere in this galaxy.” 

“Oh? Oh, you want the fourth- 
dimensional device.” 

“Exactly.” Crane then introduced 
the others, and l^naHy Seaton; who, 
having assured himself that the 
Brain could handle the stalemate 



without him, had disengaged himsdf 
from the master controller and had 
joined the party. 

“That’s right,” Seaton said. “Since 
nothing like it is known to any 
science with which we are familiar^ 
we hope to learn about it from you. 
But that . those monsters . 
they aren’t, by any chance, friends 
of yours, are they?” 

Luloy laughed. “No. Not exactly 
. or maybe they are, after a 
fashion, now. But the Llurdi were 
our unquestioned masters for so 
many thousands of years that they 
haven’t yet decided to treat us or 
anyone who looks like us with the 
courtesy reserved for equals. You 
see, the llanzlan would have commu- 
nicated with you in thought after 
he had investigated you a little.” 

“Yeah.” Seaton’s smile was grim. 
“With the stiffest, hardest probe he 
could build? And I’m supposed to 
sit still for that kind of manhandl- 
ing?” 

“No.” Mergon took over. “No one 
but a Llurd could have expected 
you to. This situation is somewhat 
unfortunate. Until very recently they 
have always had overwhelmingly su- 
perior power. They never had any 
effective opposition until we wore 
them down a little, just recently.” 
Mergon explained the situation in as 
few words as possible, concluding, 
“So this battle, while not due exact- 
ly to misunderstanding, is unfortun- 
ate. What I propose is that Luloy 
and 1 visit Klazmon via projection, 
as we are now visiting you, and ex- 
plain matters to him as we have ex- 
plained them to you. I take it yoo 
will cease fire if he does?”

“Of course. We didn’t come here 
to start a war, or to bother him in 
anyway; just to see you. So I’ll do 
better than that; 1*11 cut my offense 
right now.” 

He thought at the Brain and the 
raging inferno above the llanzlanate 
went suddenly calm and still. “That 
beam is no pencil of force, believe 
me. If it should get through it 
would volatilize his palace and half 
the city, and that would be unfortun- 
ate — hey! He’s quit slugging, too!” 

“Of course,” Mergon said. “As 1 
told you, he is — all Llurdi are — 
completely and perfectly logical. 
With their own brand of logic, of 
course. Insanely logical, to our way 
of thinking ... or perhaps M/isanely 
may be the better word. On the basis 
of the data he then had it was logi- 
cal for him to attack you. Your 
cease-fire was a new datum, one that 
he cannot as yet evaluate. He has 
deduced the fact that we Jelmi caus- 
ed it, but he does not know why you 
stopped. Hence he has restored the 
stutus quo ante, pending our expla- 
nation. He wants additional data. If 
our explanation is satisfactory — 
data sufficient — he’ll probably just 
let the whole matter drop. If not — 
if it’s data insufficient — I wouldn’t 
know. He’ll do whatever he decides 
k the logical thing to do — which 
is ’way beyond my guess-point. He 
might even resume the attack exact- 
ly where he left off; although I 
Aink he’ll be able to deduce a rea- 
son not to.” 

Seaton whistled through his teeth. 
“Holy . cat!” he said. “If that’s 
pure logic I’ll take vanilla. But how 
will you make the approach?” 



“Very easily. If two of you will 
permit us to bring you over hero 
we will send four working projec- 
tions into the Llanzlan Klazmon*! 
study, where I’m sure he’s expecting 
us. You, Doctor Seaton, and your 
Dorothy, perhaps?” 

“Not I!” Dorothy declared, shak- 
ing her head vigorously. “Uh-uh. 
Into battle, yes; this, no. ’ If I never 
see a monster like that it’ll be twenty 
minutes too soon. You’re it, Mar- 
tin.” 

“One more thing,” Mergon went 
on, as Seaton and Crane appeared 
in the flesh beside him. “Since the 
Llurdi refuse to learn any language 
except their own, I must teach yoa 
Llurdan,” and he held out two Jd- 
man thought-caps. 

“I prefer my own,” Seaton said, 
after a very short trial. “So will you, 
I think,” and he sent back for four 
of the Skylark*s latest models. 

T he two ^ Jelmi put two of them 
on. “Oh, I do indeed!” Luloy 
exclaimed, and Mergon added, “Aj 
was to have been expected, we have 
much to learn from you, friends.” 
“But listen,” Seaton said. “You 
gave the ape all the dope on that 
fourth-dimensional thing. Isn’t he 
apt to toss a superatomic into our 
Brain with it?” 

“There’s no possibility whatever 
of that, either soon or later. Not 
soon because, since they work slowly 
and thoroughly, it will be months 
yet before they have a full-scale ma- 
chine. Nor later, because the mutual 
destruction of four hundred eighty- 
two populated planets — excuse me, 
four hundred eighty, now — is not

127 




logical in any system of logic, how- 
ever cockeyed that system may be.” 
It took Seaton a fraction of a 
second to get it, but when he did, it 
rocked him. “Oh! I hadn’t figured on 
you coming all the way in. But does 
he know you will?” 

“He certainly does know it!” Lu- 
loy broke in. “Beyond a doubt; or 
what you call peradventure.” 

“Oh,” Seaton said again. “And 
that’s why he isn’t going to resume 
hostilities with ordinary weapons, 
either? Thanks, you two, a million. 
We appreciate it. Okay; we’re ready, 
I guess.” 

The four projections appeared in 
front of the llanzlan’s desk. He was 
expecting them. “Well?” he asked. 

Mergon began to explain, but Sea- 
ton cut him off. Mergon could not 
possibly feel equal to Klazmon in a 
face-to-face; Seaton could and did. 

“I can explain us better than you 
can, friend Mergon,” he said. Then, 
to the Llurd, “We came here to visit 
the human beings whom you call the 
Jelmi. We did not have, have not 
now, and do not expect to have any 
interest whatever in you Llurdi or in 
anything Llurdan. Our purpose is to 
promote intergalactic commerce and 
interhuman friendship. The various 
human races have different abilities 
and different artifacts and different 
knowledges — many of each of 
which are of benefit to other human 
races. 

“You made an unprovoked attack 
on us. Know now, Llan^an Klaz- 
mon, that I do not permit invasion, 
either mental or physical, by any 
entity — man, beast, god, devil or 
Llurd — of this or of any other gal- 



axy. Although 1 can imagine few 
subjects upon which you and I could 
converse profitably, if you wish to 
talk to me as one intelligent and lo- 
gical entity to another I will so con- 
verse. But I repeat — I will not per- 
mit invasion. 

“If you wish to resume battle on 
that account that is your right and 
your privilege. You will note, how- 
ever, that our screens handled your 
attack with ease; and that our at- 
tack was metered precisely to a point 
just below your maximum capabfllty 
of resistance. Know now that if you 
force us to destroy your city and 
perhaps your world it will not have 
been the first city or the first world 
we have been forced to destroy; nor, 
with a probability of point nine nine 
nine, wBl it have been the last Do 
you want peace with us or war?” 

iiT)eace. Data sufficient,” Klaz- 

-T mon said immediately. “I 
have recorded the fact that there is 
at least one Jelmoid race other than 
the Jehni themselves of which some 
representatives are both able and 
willing to employ almost Llurdan 
logic,” and he switched his attentimi 
from the projections to the tape he 
had been studying — cutting com- 
munications as effectively as though 
he had removed himself to another 

WOTld. 

Back in the Mallidaxian, while 
Luloy stared at Seaton almost in 
awe, Mergon said, “That was a beau- 
tiful job. Doctor Seaton. Perfect! 
Much better than I could have done. 
You used flawless Llurdan logic.” 

“Thanks to the ace in the hole you 
gave me with your briefing, I could

IF 




do it. I’d hate to have to run a 
bluff on that ape. What’s next on 
the agenda, Savant Mergon?” 

“Make it ‘Merg’, please, and I’ll 
call you ‘Dick’. Now that this is 
settled, why don’t you put your for- 
tress-planetoid on automatic and let 
us bring you all here, so that our 
peoples may become friends in per- 
son and may begin work upon tasks 
of mutual interest?” 

“That’s a thought, friend; that 
really is a thought,” Seaton said, and 
it was done forthwith. 

Aboard the Mallidaxian, Seaton 
cut the social amenities as short as 
he courteously could; then went with 
inseparable Mergon and Luloy to 
Tammon’s laboratory. That fourth- 
dimensional gizmo was what he was 
interested in. With his single-mind- 
edness that was all he was interested 
in, at the moment, of the entire 
Jelman culture. All four donned 
Skylark thought-helmets and Seaton 
set out to learn everything there was 
to he known about that eight million 
cubic feet of esoteric apparatus. And 
Mergon, who didn’t know much of 
anything about recent developments, 
was eager to catch up. 

Seaton did not learn all about the 
fourth-dimensional device in one 
day, nor in pne week; but when he 
had it all filed away in the Brain 
he asked, “Is that all you have of 
it?” He did not mean to be insult- 
ing: he was onlv greatly surprised. 

The old savant bristled and Seaton 
apologized hastily. “I didn’t mean to 
belittle your achievement in any 
sense, sir. It’s probably the greatest 
breakthrough ever made. But it 
doesn’t seem to be complete." 



“Of course it isn’t completef" 
Tammon snapped. “I’ve been work- 
ing on it only — ” 

“Oh, I didn’t mean that,” Seatoa 
broke in. “The concept is incomplete. 
In several ways. For instance, if 
fourth-dimensional translation is us- 
ed as a weapon, you have no defense 
against it.” 

“Of course there’s no defense 
against it!” Tammon defended hit 
brain-child like a tigress defending 
her young. “By the very nature of 
things there can*t be any defense 
against itf’ 

At that, politeness went by the 
board. “You’re wrong,” Seaton said, 
flatly. “By the very nature of things 
there has to be. All nature is built 
on a system of checks and balances. 
Doing a job so terrifically big and 
so brand new, I doubt if anybody 
could get the whole thing at once. 
Let’s go over the theory again, to- 
gether, with a microscope, to see if 
we can’t add something to it some- 
where?” 

'T^ammon agreed, but reluctantly. 

Deep down in his own mind ha 
did not believe that any other mind 
could improve upon any particular 
of his work. As the review progress- 
ed, however, he became more and 
more enthusiastic. As well he might; 
for the mathematics section of Rich- 
ard Seaton’s multi-compartmented 
mind contained, indexed and cross- 
indexed, all the work done bv count- 
less grand masters of the subject 
during half a million years. 

Luloy started to pull her helmet 
off, but Mergon stopped her with a 
direct thought “I’m lost, too, sweet,

but keep on listening. We can get 
bits here and there — and we’ll prob- 
ably never have the chance again to 
watch two such minds at work.” 
“Hold it!” Seaton snapped, half 
an hour later. “Back up — there! 
This integral here. Limits zero to pi 
over two. You’re limiting the thing 
to a large but definitely limited vol- 
ume of your generalized N-dimen- 
sional space. I think it should be 
between zero and infinity — and 
while we’re at it let’s scrap half of 
the third determinant in that no- 
space-no-time complex. Let’s see 
what happens if we substitute the 
gamma function here and the chi 
there and the xi there and the omi- 
cron down there in the corner.” 

“But why?'’ the old savant pro- 
tested. “I don’t see any possible rea- 
son for any of it.” 

Seaton grinned. “There isn’t any 
— any more than there was for 
your original brainstorm. If there 
had been the Norlaminian would 
have worked this whole shebang out 
a hundred thousand years ago. It’s 
nothing but a hunch, but it’s strong 
enough so I want to follow it up — 
okay? Fine then, integrating that, we 
get . .” 

Five hours later, Tammon took his 
helmet off and stared at Seaton with 
wonder in his eyes. “Do you realize 
just what you’ve done, young man? 
You have made a breakthrough at 
least equal to my own. Opened up 
a whole vast new field — a field 
parallel to my own, perhaps, but in 
no sense the same.” 

“I wouldn’t say that. Merely an 
enlargement. All I did was follow a 
hunch.” 



“An intuition,” Tammon correct- 
ed him. “What else, pray, makes 
breakthroughs?” 

And Luloy, on the way out of the 
laboratory hand in hand with Mer- 
gon, said, “I had no idea that Tellus 
ever did or ever could produce any- 
body like him. He is their god’s fair- 
haired child, for a fact. Sennlloy will 
have to know about this, Merg.” 
“She will indeed — I was sure 
you’d think of that.” 

And as soon as Dorothy could get 
Seaton alone that evening she stared 
at him with a variety of emotions 
playing over her highly expressive 
face. As though she had never seen 
him before; or as though she were 
getting acquainted with him all over 
again. “I’ve been talking to Sennl- 
loy,” she announced. “Or, rather, 
she’s been talking to me. She didn’t 
lose much time, did she?” 

Seaton blushed to the roots of his 
hair. “I’ll say she didn’t. Not any. 
She knocked me for a block-long 
row of ash cans.” 

“Uh-huh. Me, too — and how! 
She told me you said I’d blow my 
red top and I just about did, until 
she explained. She’s quite a gal, isn’t 
she? And what a shape! You know. 
I’m awfully glad I’m not too bad in 
that shape department myself, or I’d 
die of mortification looking at them? 
But Dick — don’t you suppose there 
are any people in this whole cock- 
eyed universe except us and the 
Rayseenians who don’t run around 
naked all the time?” 

“I wouldn’t know; but what has 
all that got to do with the price of 
hasheesh c.i.f. Instanbul?” 

“It ties in. She must have thought 



1.30 



IF 




I was some kind of an idiot child, 
but she didn’t show it. She couldn’t 
really understand my taboos, she said, 
since they were not in her own here- 
dity, but she could accept them as 
facts in mine and work within their 
limitations.” Dorothy blushed, but 
went on, “I’d be the only Prime 
Operator — and so forth. You know 
about the ‘and so forth*. Anyway, 
before she got done she actually 
made me feel ashamed of myselfl 
They really need your genes, Dick. 
You didn’t let on, did you, that Du- 
Quesne’s a Tellurian, too?” 

“I’ll say I didn’tl The less they 
think that ape and I came from the 
same world, the better I’ll like it.** 
“You aivd me both. Well, she 
didn’t actually say so, but when she 
found out what kind of genes you 
have she decided to pour every one 
of DuQuesne’s right down the 
drain." 

“Could be.” Seaton didn’t agree 
with that conclusion at all, but he 
was too smart to argue the point. 

A t breakfast the following morn- 
ing Seaton said, “You chirped 
it, birdie, about their thinking us 
some kind of idiot children. Besides, 
the Hrst Principle and Prime Tenet 
of all diplomacy has always been, 
‘When in Rome be a Roman candle’. 
So I think we’d all better peel to 
the raw as <rf now. You and I had 
better, whether the rest do or not. 
Check?” 

“Check — but I think they will. 
We’re horribly conspicuous, dressed. 
People look at us as though we were 
things that had escaped from a zoo. 
And all the Green System people 



have always thought we were morij 
than somewhat loco in the coco fovi 
covering up so much. We’ll get used 
to it easily enough — look at the 
nudists. So lead on, my bold and 
valiant — I follow thee to the bitter 
end of all my raiment.” 

“I knew you would, ace. Let’s go 
spread the gospel.” 

When they approached the Cranes 
and the Japanese on the subject, 
Margaret threw back her black- 
thatched head and laughed. “We 
must be psychic — we were going to 
spring the same thing on you. And 
after aU, actually, how much do our 
bathing suits hide? Yours or mine 
either one? And we have it to show, 
too — so here goesi The last one un- 
dressed is Stinker of the Day!” She 
began to unzip, then paused and 
looked at Lotus. 

The Nisei girl shrugged. “We all 
shoidd, of course, I won’t like it and 
I positively know Fll never get used 
to it, but if you two do I will too 
if it kills me.” 

“’At-a-girl, Lambie!” Margaret put 
her arm around the beautifully form- 
ed little body and squeezed. “But 
you just wait — you’ll have it really 
made. None of ^em ever saw any- 
thing like you before, you gorgeous 
Httle doH, you. With your size and 
bufld youhl be the absolute Queen of

Roman Candles 

C ountless parsecs away, Marc C. 

DuQuesne was carrying out his 
own plans — {dans which would 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



131 




kave been a most unpleasant surprise 
for the Skylarkers had they known 
about them. 

DuQuesne moved the surviving 
Fenachrone into his DQ easily 
enough and without incident. Hous- 
ing was no problem. How could it 
be, with millions upon millions of 
cubic kilometers of space available 
and with automatic high-order con- 
•tnictors to do the work? Nor was 
atmosphere, nor food nor any other 
necessity or desideratum of Fenach- 
ronian life and/or well-being a prob- 
lem. 

Fenachrone engineers did it all — 
by operating special keyboards and 
by thinking into carefully limited 
headsets — but none of them had 
any idea whatever of what it was 
that did any given task or how it 
did it. None of this knowledge, of 
either practice or theory, was in their 
science; and DuQuesne took great 
pains to be sure that none of them 
got any chance to learn any iota of 
it. He taught them, and they learned, 
piirel by rote. 

Like nigh-school girls learning to 
drive automobiles. They can become 
cxcellen’ drivers; but with only that 
type of instruction none of them will 
ever become able to design a hypoid 
gear or to understand in detail the 
operation of an automatic clutch. 

The Fenachrone did not like such 
treatment Sleemet in particular, 
when he began to recover some of 
the normal pugnaciously prideful 
spirit of his race, did not like it at 
all and said so; but DuQuesne did 
not care a particle whether he liked 
it or not. 

DuQuesne’s snapping black eyes 



stared, contemptuously unaffected, 
into the furiously hypnotic, red-light- 
ed black eyes of the Fenachrone. 
“You megalomaniacal cretin,” he 
sneered. “How can you possibly fig- 
ure that it makes any difference 
whatever to me, what you like or 
don’t like? If you have any fraction 
of a brain you’d better start using 
it. If you haven’t or can’t or won’t. 
I’ll build you a duplicate of your 
original ship and turn you all loose 
today.” 

“You will? In that case — ” Slee- 
met got that far and stopped cold 
in mid-sentence. 

“Yeah.” DuQuesne’s tone cut like 
a knife. “Exactly. We’re still within 
Klazmon’s range; we will be for 
quite a while yet. Do you want to be 
turned loose here?” 

“Well, no.” If the thought occur- 
red to him that DuQuesne was lying, 
he didn’t show it. That was just as 
well for Sleemet and for the Fena- 
chrone race. DuQuesne wasn’t. 

“Maybe you have a brain of sorts, 
at that. But if you don’t forget this 
Master Race flapdoodle, all of it and 
fast, you’ll last quick. Remember 
how easily that self-styled Overlord 
wiped out your navy and then vola- 
tilized your whole stinking world? 
And how easily Klazmon of Llurd- 
iax smacked your whole fleet down? 
And what a fool I made and am still 
making of Klazmon? And I know of 
one race that is as much ahead of 
mine as I am ahead of you; and of 
another race that may be somewhat 
ahead of us Xylmnians in some 
ways. As I said, you’re about eleven 
hundred thousand years behind. 
Have you got brains enough to rea- 



132 ' 



IF 




fee that instead of being top dog 
you’re just low man on the totem 
pole?" 

“It you’re so high and we’re so 
low,” Sleemet snarled, “why did you 
take us away from the Llurd? Of 
whai possible use can we be to 
you?” 

“You have certain mental and 
physical Ljualities that may perhaps 
be ot use in a project 1 have in 
mind You are not only able and 
willing to fight, you really like to 
fight These qualities should, theore- 
tically, make you better in some re- 
spects than automatics in operating 
the offensive weapons of a base as 
large as this one is.” DuQuesne stu- 
died the Fenachrone appraisingly. “I 
do not really need you, but I am 
willing to make the experiment on 
the terms 1 have stated. I will allow 
you two Xylmnian minutes in which 
to decide whether or not to cooper- 
ate with me in such an experiment.” 

“We will cooperate,” Sleemet said 
in less than one minute; whereupon 
DuQuesne told him in broad terms 
what he had in mind. 

And for many days thereafter the 
two, so unlike physically but so simi- 
lar in so many respects mentally, 
devoted themselves wholeheartedly 
to the finer and ever finer refine- 
ment of the placing and tuning of 
mechanisms and of the training of 
already hard-trained personnel. 

But DuQuesne knew that, given 
the slightest > opportunity, the Fena- 
chrone would take high delight in 
killing him and taking the DQ. 
Wherefore he did not at any time 
trust any one of them as far as he 
could spit. 



M oreover, DuQuesne was not 
quite as sure of his own vic- 
tory as he had given the Fenachrone 
to understand. 

DuQuesne was not easy in his 
mind about Galaxy DW-427-LU. He 
hadn't been, not since some super- 
powered enemy in that galaxy had 
attacked Seaton’s Skylark of Valeron 
without warning and had burned her 
down to a core before she could get 
out of range. And she hadn’t been 
able to fight back. That one blast 
back at them couldn’t have done 
any damage. 

It had been that uneasiness that 
had been responsible for the DQ*s 
terrific armament and for Du- 
Quesne’s wanting the Fenachrone 
for a crew. Wherefore, as soon as 
the Fenachrone were settled in their 
new quarters and before they had 
recovered enough of their normal 
combativeness to become completely 
unmanageable, DuQuesne got “on 
the com” with Sleemet. 

“. I don’t give a damn what 
happens to Earth or to Norlamin. 
Fm no longer interested in either,” 
he said in part. “But I don’t want 
it to happen to me and you don’t 
want it to happen to you. You agree 
with me. I’m sure, that a good stra- 
tegist does not leave an enemy be- 
hind him without knowing, at very 
least, who that enemy is and what 
he can do.” 

“That is one of the basics, yes.” 
“All right. Somebody in this gal- 
axy here has more muscle than I 
like.” DuQuesne pointed out Galaxy 
DW-427-LU in his tank and told 
Sleemet what had happened to the 
Skylark of Valeron, then went on, 



134 



IF 




**Oii theoretical grounds, the degree 
of sychronization could make all the 
difference.” He had reached by theo- 
ry the same point that Seaton had 
arrived at by experience. “Hence, 
the greater the number of operators 
— of equal skill, of course — the 
tighter the output. The efficiency 
will vary directly as the cube of the 
number of operators.” 

‘T see.” Sleemet did see, and for 
the first time became really inter- 
ested. “That will be to our advan- 
tage as well as yours. You will have 
to teach us much.” 

“ril teach you everything you 
have to know. Nothing else.” 
“That is assumed . But I see 
no possibility of assurance that you 
will keep your bargain ... or will 
you go mind to mind that you will 
release us and build us a ship after 
this one expedition as your crew?” 
“Yes. Without reservation.” 

“In that case we will cooperate 
fully.” 

And they did — and so it was that 
the DQ became the most fantastical- 
ly armed and powered and defended 
fortress that had ever moved its own 
mass through space. 

A s the DQ approached Galaxy 
DW-427-LU, with everything 
she had either wide open or on the 
trips, DuQuesne braked her down 
and swung into what he called “the 
curve of fastest getaway” — and as 
he did so, in the instant, the mighty 
vessel’s every defense went blinding- 
white. 

And in that same instant two 
thousand nine hundred seventy-seven 
Fenachrone, males and females but 



superlatively expert technicians all, 
pressed activating switches and took 
command, each of a tightly cluster- 
ed battery of micrometrically syn- 
chronized generators. 

And one black-browed, hard-eyed 
Tellurian, sat with his head buried 
in the DQs master-control helmet. 

While he had not expected to find 
any significant fraction of what ho 
actually found, he was not too ap- 
palled to go viciously and pin-poinl- 
accurately to work. Working througji 
the fourth dimension, with the tran- 
sfinite speed of thought, he hurled 
bomb af cr bomb after multi-billion- 
kiloton superatomic bomb: and the 
target world of each one of those 
bombs became a sun. 

And the DQ got away. She was by 
no means intact; but, since her skin 
had been very much thicker than the 
Valeron’s to start with, there was 
still some of it left when she got out 
of range. 

Thereupon DuQuesne put on the 
headset of the DQ's Brain and be- 
gan to think. He had tried direct 
attack on the galaxy of Chlorans; it 
had failed. His next step, obviously, 
was — to decide what his next step 
should be. 

The flesh-and-blood brain that was 
thinking into the energy-and-metal 
Brain of the DQ was no whit less 
logical, no iota less unsentimental in 
its judgments than the great comput- 
er itself. Man-brain and machine- 
brain together considered the evi- 
dence. Datum: The DQ was not up 
to handling Galaxy DW-427-LU. 
Datum: Not even the added muscle 
conferred by the willing cooperation 
of the Fenachrone was enough to 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



13S 




make it so. Datum: No discoverable 
increase oi its armaments or its crew 
would give it even a fighting chance 
against the energies that had just 
come so close to destroying it. 

Wherefore — 

Finally, an hour later, DuQuesne 
raised the microphone of a repeating 
sixth-order broadcasting transmitter 
to his lips and said — dispassionate- 
ly. unemotionally and with no more 
expression than if he had been ord- 
ering up his lunch: 

“DuQuesne calling Seaton reply 
as before stop.” 

XXIV 
The Talent 

S eaton had thought that the visit 
to the Jelmi would be a short 
one, just long enough to get the “giz- 
mo”, but his own breakthrough put 
an end to such thinking. It took 
days to reduce the theory to prac- 
tice and weeks to build into the 
Skylark of Valeron the gigantic in- 
stallations Seaton wanted. 

The very enormity of the break- 
through changed all plans, dislocat- 
ed all schedules. To the Jelmi the 
fourth-dimensional translator had 
been a phenomenon — a weapon — 
in itself. It had extremely valuable 
applications,, and each of them of- 
fered a long career of study. That 
was enough for them. But to Seaton 
and Crane and the Norlaminians it 
was something more than that; it 
was an effect, a new and unexplored 
area of knowledge, to be fitted some- 
how into the known and computed 
structure of sixth-order — perhaps of 



other-order — effects; and to be used 
and considered in conjunction with 
them. It was a theorist’s dream — 
and an engineer’s nightmare. 

Meanwhile, as the male Skylark- 
ers, their Jelm colleagues and the 
Norlaminians were busily getting 
done the impossible task of exploring 
a whole new field of knowledge and 
transmuting it into actual structures 
and gigantic machines, the women 
of the party were exploring the lift 
of an alien race . and having the 
time of their respective lives doing 
it. Sitar, of course, was in her ele- 
ment. Bare skin and jewelrj^ she 
liked. She liked to look at and to 
feel her mink coat, she said, but 
she hated to have to wear it; and as 
for that horrible, scratchy under- 
wear — augh! Hence, now that the 
personal gravity controls were per- 
sonal heaters as well, she was really 
enjoying herself. 

Dorothy and Margaret, of course, 
took to it as though to the manner 
born. In three days neither of them 
was any more conscious of nudity 
than was Sennlloy herself. Even Lo- 
tus got used to it. While she could 
never become an enthusiastic nudist, 
she said, she did stop blushing. In 
fact, she almost stopped feeling like 
blushing. 

“Dick,” Dorothy said one eve- 
ning. “I’ve finally made contact 
with them on music.” 

**Musicr he snorted. “Huh! It 
sounds to me like a gaggle of tom- 
cats yowling on a hack fence.” 

She laiiehed. “It’s unworldly, of 
course, but a lot of it is beautiful, in 
a weird sort of way, and they have 
some magnificent techniques. I’ve 



136 



IF 




been trying everything on them, you 
know, and they’ve just been sitting 
on their hands. I’ll give you three 
guesses as to what I Anally hit them 
with.” 

“Strauss waltzes? Jazz? Don*t tell 
me it was rock-’n’-roll.” 

She laughed. “Old-fashioned rag- 
time. Not what they call rag these 
days, but real syncopation. And pol- 
kas. Specifically, three old, old re- 
cordings — with improved sound, of 
course. Pee Wee Hunt’s Twelfth 
Street Rag, Plehal Brothers’ Beer 
Barrel Polka, and — of all things! — 
Glahe Musette’s Hot Pretzels. They 
simply grabbed the ball and ran all 
over the place with it. What they 
came up with is neither rag nor 
polka — in fact, it’s like nothing 
ever heard before on any world — 
but it’s really toe-tingling stuff. 
Comes the dance tomorrow evening 
rH show you some steps and leaps 
and bounds that will knock your 
eyes right out of their sockets.” 

“I believe that, if what the gals 
have been teaching me is any criter- 
ion. You have to be a mind-reader, 
an adagio dancer and a ground-and- 
lofty tumbler, and have an eidetic 
memory. But I hope I won’t smash 
any of the girls’ arches down or 
kick any of their faces in.” 

“Don’t fish, darling. I know how 
good you are. Ain’t I been practic- 
ing with you for lo, these many 
periods?” 

At the dance it became clear that 
Seaton’s statement was (as, it must 
be admitted, some of his statements 
were!) somewhat exaggerated. There 
was a great deal of acrobatics — 
Seaton and Sennlloy took advantage 



of every clear space to perform 
handspring-and-flip routines in uni- 
son. But everything was strictly ac- 
cording to what each person could 
do and wished to do. Thus, men 
and women alike danced with the 
Osnomians as though they were 
afraid of breaking them in two — 
which they were. And thus Lotus 
was, as Margaret had foretold that 
she would be, the belle of the ball. 
Hard- trained gymnast and acrobat 
that she was, her feet were off the 
floor most of the time; and before 
the dance was an hour old she was 
being tossed delightedly by her part- 
ner of the moment over the heads 
of half a dozen couples to some 
other man who was signalling for 
a free catch. 

T hree days before the Skylark*s 
departure, Mergon announced 
that there would be a full-formal 
farewell party on the evening before 
the takeoff. 

“What are you going to wear, 
Dick?” Crane asked. 

Seaton grinned. “Urvan of Ur- 
vania’s royal regalia. All of it. 
You?” 

“I’m going as Tarnan, the Karbix 
of Osnome; with guns, knives, brace- 
lets and legbands complete. And a 
pair of forty-fives besides.” 

“Nice! And I’ll wear my three- 
fifty-sevens, then, too. If I can find 
a place to hang them on anywhere.” 
And Dorothy and Margaret each 
wore about eleven quarts of gems. 

As the eight guests entered the 
dining hall — last, as protocol dic- 
tated — and the eight hundred Jelmi 
rose to their feet as one, the spec- 



SKYURK DuQUeSNE 



137 




tacle was something that not one of 
the six Tellurians would ever forget. 
DuQuesne had seen a few Jelmi in 
full formal panoply; but here were 
eight hundred of them! 

After the sumptuous meal the 
tables vanished; music — a spine- 
tingling, not-too-fast march — swell- 
ed into being; and dancing began. 

Dancing, if dancing it could be 
called, that bore no relationship 
whatever to the boisterous sport of 
which there had been so much. Each 
step and motion and genuflection 
and posture was stately, graceful, 
poised and studied. The whole was 
very evidently the finished product 
of centuries of refinement and per- 
fection of technique. And at its close 
each of the eight honored guests 
was amazed to find that their move- 
ments had been so artfully yet in- 
conspicuously guided that each of 
them had grasped hands once with 
every Jelm on the floor. 

And on the way to their quarters 
Dorothy, her eyes brimming with 
unshed tears, pressed Seaton’s arm 
against her side. “Oh, Dick, wasn’t 
that simply wonderful? I could cry. 
Only once in my life before has 
anything ever hit me as hard as that 
did.’’ 

T^STell on the way back to Galaxy 
▼ V DW-427-LU, Seaton was hum- 
ming happily to himself. He had 
gone, through everything for ♦^he 
umpteenth time and for the ump- 
teenth time had found everything 
good. 

“Mart,” he said. “We have now 
got exactly what it takes to make big 
medicine on those Chloran apes. The 



only question is, do we wipe ’em 
completely out now or do we let 
’em suffer a while longer? Suffer in 
durance vile?” 

If he had waited a few hours 
longer to speak so, he would have 
kept his mouth shut; for that same 
afternoon the Skylark's screens again 
went instantaneously into full-pow- 
ered incandescent defense. The 
Brain took evasive action at once; 
but it was five long hours before 
they got far enough away from the 
source of that incredible flood of 
energy so that it became ineffective 
and was cut off. During that five 
hours Seaton and Crane observed 
and computed and analyzed and 
thought. When it was over, Seaton 
scanned the Skylark's resgrve supply 
of power uranium; and his face was 
grim and hard when he called the 
others into conference. 

“I wouldn’t have believed it pos- 
sible,” he said flatly. “I can hardly 
believe it now, after watching it hap- 
pen. Either they’ve been building 
stuff twenty-four hours a day ever 
since we left . .” He paused. 

“Or they’ve got myriads of myria- 
watts.” Dunark said into that pause, 
“that they couldn’t sync in then, but 
can now.” 

“Could be,” Seaton agreed. “Let’s 
see if we can find anything put. 
We’re too far away to hold any- 
thing, even a planet. But with all of 
us looking we should be able to see 
something — and the gizmo can 
handle eight projections as easily as 
one. Has anybody got any better 
ideas?” 

Since no one had, they tried it 
“Riding the beam” is a weird sen-

sation; a sense of duality of person- 
ality that must be experienced to 
be either appreciated or understood. 
The physical body is here; its dupli- 
cate in patterns of pure force is 
there: the two separate entities see 
and hear and smell and taste and 
feel two entirely different environ- 
ments at the same time. It is a thing 
that takes some getting used to; but 
all the Skylarkers except Lotus were 
used to it. And she. as has been 
intimated, was a quick study. 

Seaton could not hold the projec- 
tions anywhere near any planet; 
could not hold them even inside a 
solar system. Even with the vernier 
controls locked and Seaton’s hands 
resolutely off, the point of view 
jumped erratically about in fantastic 
leaps of hundreds of billions of 
miles. Not even the huge — and re- 
inforced — mass of the Skylark of 
Valeron coidd hold them steady. They 
swept dizzily into the chromospheres 
of suns, out into the cold dark of 
interstellar vacuum, through tenuous 
gas clouds and past orbiting planets. 
In theory — if theory meant any- 
thing in this unexplored area — the 
fourth-dimensional “gizmo” should 
have been able to lock steadily on 
a target. In practice, they could 
hardly find a target to lock onto. 
All eight of the Skylarkers were 
synced in at once to the master 
controls, but their best efforts could 
not keep them even inside a solar 
system, much less give them the 
rock-steady fix that would have per- 
mitted them to spy on enemy acti- 
vity. 

And the magnitude of error grew. 
In a minute they were swinging in 



huge arcs of a parsec or more, ia 
another minute the swings had be- 
come so enormous and so random 
that they could not measure them. 
Their speed was immense; they 
swung dizzyingly toward a cepheid 
variable and it winked at them like 
a traffic blinker, spun past, a flam 
star and watched its great gouts of 
flame leap out and fall back. 

Five minutes of this insane cavort- 
ing made half the party seasick, and 
they pulled out of projection and 
returned, gasping and staggering, tn 
the welcome stability of the Skylark* 
Seaton stuck it out for half an hour. 
Then he pushed the “cancel” button. 

“That’s vdiat I was afraid of,” hm 
growled. “Every time we wiggle a 
finger or a fly lights on a table M 
changes the shape of the whole shtpi 
Oh, for something really rigid tm

of the precise worker in any Eeld9 
“But we each saw something. We*l 
report in turn.” 

Seaton gave a brief description od 
his own observations. He had seen 
something, no more than a flicker, 
but clearly big and Chloran-madn. 
Dunark had spotted what sounded 
like the same planet-sized mass, but 
in the system of a G-3 star, as near- 
ly as he could tell; Seaton’s had been 
an F. 

The others had seen nothing. See- 
ton nodded. “Okay. There are at 
least two solar systems having for- 
tified Chloran planets, with one 
more probable. Ideas, anybody?” 

Crane broke the ensuing silence. 
“I can’t come up with anything con- 
structive. Just the opposite. There*! 
something basically wrong here,

Dick. As 1 understand the Tammon- 
Seaton Theory, the operators involv- 
ed here are all in the no-space-no* 
time field, so that distance does not 
enter. Hence it is possible in theory, 
and should be in practice, to place 
a bomb anywhere in all total space 
as accurately and as easily as you 
can touch the end of your nose with 
the tip of your finger.” 

Dorothy whistled, Dunark looked 
shocked, and the others looked 
blank. Seaton scowled and said, 
“Yeah . But with all points in 
total space coexistent — Gunther’s 
Universe — how are you going to 
pick any given one out? What kind 
of an operator would it take? There’s 
a hole. Mart, in either the theory or 
in the reduction . He paused, 
frowning in thought. 

“Or both,” Crane said. 

“Or both,” Seaton agreed. “Okay, 
let’s skip down and find it.” 

They went down and worked with 
the Brain all the rest of the day; but 
they did not find the hole. Nor did 
they find it the next day, or the 
next. Then Seaton began to pace the 
floor. 

“So, in all probability, another 
breakthrough is required,” Crane 
said. “And I can’t help you on that; 
I’m not the genius type.” 

“Neither am I!” Seaton snorted. 
“In my book one flash-in-the-pan 
hunch does not make a genius . 
But here’s another angle, fella. If 
this thing can be worked out it’ll be 
so much better than that synchroni- 
zation idea that it isn’t funny. Also, 
it might not take the years to work 
out. Don’t you think it’ll be worth 
while, Mart, to spend a few days 



seeing if we can set it up as a prob- 
lem? See if we can take it out of 
the pure brainstorm category before 
we spring it on Rovol?” 

“I do indeed,” and Seaton and 
Crane both went down to the con- 
trol room and got into their master 
controllers. 

However, before that task was 
finished there was a surprise for 
Richard Seaton. 

XXV 

Co-Belligerents 

44T^uQuesne calling Seaton re- 
JlJ ply . .” 

Since Seaton’s head was inside his 
master controller, no speaker sound- 
ed. Since everything pertaining to 
DuQuesne was on file in the Brain’s 
memory banks, there was no delay 
whatever in making the proper con- 
nections: Seaton cut in before the 
first send of the message, short as 
it was, was completed. 

“What the helly DuQuesne!” his 
thought blazed out. “I didn’t think 
even you would have the sublime 
guts to call on me again!” 

“Save it, Seaton. This is impor- 
tant. Do you know how many solar 
systems of Chlorans there are in that 
galaxy where your Skylark of Valer- 
on got burned out?” 

Seaton paused for one microsec- 
ond. Then, cautiously: 

“No idea. Hundred, maybe. Or, 
in view of this — thousands?” 

“You aren’t even warm. My ap- 
paratus put one hundred forty-nine 
million three hundred nineteen thou- 
sand two hundred ninety-seven of

Ilicm into my tank before my scan- 
ners went out. And they hadn’t cov- 
ered a quarter of the galaxy yet.” 

. .” Seaton began, but shut 
himself up. Dorothy was listening 
in. “But to be able to use a sixth- 
order analsynth that long you must 
have had a little more . okay, 
gimme the dope.” 

DuQuesne told his story, includ- 
ing his superpowered DQ and his 
Pcnachrone crew; concluding, “We 
knocked out over fifteen thousand 
of them before I had to run. But of 
course that wasn’t a drop in the pro- 
verbial bucket. Worse, I doubt like 
ike devil if any mobile base possible 
to build can ever get that close to 
tiiem again. Apparently they sync in 
Just enough stuff — no matter how 
much it takes — to cope with the 
maximum observed threat.” 

“Could be. But how come you 
are interested? I know damn well 
what you want.” 

“Not any more you don’t,” snap- 
ped DuQuesne’s thought. “With 
•very two-bit Tom, Dick, and Harry 
of a race in all space having atomic 
•aergy already, what’s the chance of 
a monopoly? So what good is Earth 
er anything else in the First Galaxy? 
Fve changed my plans — you and 
Crane can both live forever, as far 
as I’m concerned.” 

Seaton absorbed and filed that 
statement — guardedly. He only said: 
“So what? Why should you give 
a whoop about the Chlorans? Don’t 
tell me you’re altruistic all of a sud- 
den.” 

“You apparently don’t see the 
point. Listen — the Fenachrone talk- 
ed about mastering the cosmos. That 



race of Chlorans is quietly and un- 
obtrusively doing it. It may be too 
late to stop them; and I didn’t help 
matters a bit by making them dol^ 
ble or quadruple their synchronized 
output. You and I are, as far as we 
know, humanity’s ablest operators. 
Each of us has stuff the other lacks. 
If you and I together can’t stop 
them it can’t — as of now — be 
done. What do you say?” 

Seaton pondered. What was Du- 
Ouesne’s angle this time? Or was 
the ape actually on the up and up? 
It did make sense, though — even 
though he was a louse and a heel 
and a case-hardened egomaniac, if it 
came down to a choice of which 
was going to be wiped out, those 
monsters or humanity . sure he 
would . 

“Okay, Blackie. You give your 
word?” 

“I give my word to act as one of 
your party until this Chloran thing 
is settled, one way or the other.” 

A few days later, the ultra-fast 
speedster that Seaton had left 
on Ray-See-Nee hailed the Valeron, 
matched velocities with her, and was 
drawn aboard. Three women disem- 
barked; one of whom was Kay-Lee 
Barlo. She introduced her black- 
haired mother, Madame Barlo; who, 
with the added poise and maturity of 
her extra twenty-odd years, was even 
better-looking than her daughter. 
She in turn introduced her mother, 
Grand Dame Barlo, who did not 
have a single white hair in her thick 
brown thatch and who did not look 
more than half as old as she must 
in reality have been.

‘‘But, listen,’’ Seaton said. “You 
couldn’t use any sixth-order stuff 
at first, so you must have been on 
the way for weeks. What happened? 
Trouble with the Chlorans?” 

He had been talking to Kay-Lec, 
but her mother, who was very evi- 
dently the head of the party, an- 
swered him. 

“Oh, no. That is, they’ve tripled 
the quotas — ” Seaton shot a ^ance 
at Crane. That tied in! — “but with 
the new machinery that did not 
bother us at all. No. We learned 
many weeks ago that you would 
have need of us, so we came.” 
“Huh?” Seaton demanded, in- 
elegantly. “What need?” 

“We do not surely know. All we 
know is that it is written upon the 
Scroll that a time of need will come, 
and soon. All Ray-See-Nee is enor- 
mously and eternally in your debt: 
we are here to repay a tiny portion 
of that debt.” 

“Can’t you tell me more about it 
than that?” 

“A little; not much. We received 
your original message, but at that 
time there was nothing to connect it 
with you as Ky-El Mokak. In 
studying it we encountered some- 
thing unknown upon Ray-See-Nee 
that increased a hundredfold our 
range and scope and strength: three 
male poles of power of tremendous 
magnitude; men who, we found out 
later, you already know. They are 
Drasnik and Fodan of the planet 
Norlamin and Sacner Carfon of 
Dasor. With three such pairs of 
poles of power — three is the one 
perfect number, you know — it was 
a simple matter to locate those in- 



terested in your message, to develop 
the powers that had been latent in 
such people as yourself — ” 

**What?*^ Seaton yelped. That was 
ell he could get out. 

“ — and Dr. DuQuesne and others, 
yes,” Madame Barlo went on 
smoothly. “You were, of course, not 
aware you possessed them.” 

“That’s putting it mildly, ace,” 
said Seaton. “You mean / am . 
I hate to use the word . well, 
‘psychic’?” 

“The word is of no importance,” 
said the woman impatiently. “Use 
any word you like. The fact is that 
you do have this power; we have 
developed it . and we now pro- 
pose to put it to use.” 

S eaton’s reply to that has not been 
recorded for posterity. Perhaps 
it is as well. Let it only be said that 
even twenty-four hours later he was 
no more than half-convinced . 
but it was the half of him that was 
convinced that was governing his 
actions. 

One of the data that helped con- 
vince him was the fact that Madame 
Barlo and her daughter had not 
merely located these “poles of pow- 
er” — they had summoned them to 
the Skylark! They bad not waited 
for Seaton’s concurrence; before 
Seaton even knew what they were 
up to. all the named individuals 
from three galaxies and a dozen 
planets were on the way. 

A shipload of Norlaminians and 
Dasorians — including the three pre- 
eminent “male poles of power” — 
was the contingent first to arrive. 
Then came Tammon and Sennlloy 



142 



IF 




•ad Mergon and Luloy and half a 
hundred other Jelmi; bringing with 
them three Tellurians: Madlyn Man- 
nis, the red-haired stripper; Doctor 
Stephanie de Marigny of the Rare 
Metals Laboratory; and Charles K. 
van der Gleiss, Petrochemical Engi- 
neer T-8. And last, but by less than 
an hour, came Marc C. DuQuesne 
in person. 

‘‘Hi, Hunkie,” he said, shaking 
hands cordiallv. little out of your 
regular orbit? Like me?” 

“More than a little, Blackie — 
like you.” She showed two deep dim- 
ples in a wide and friendly smile. 
“And if you have any idea of what 
I’m here for T’d be delighted to have 
you tell me what it is.” 

“T scarcely know what I’m here 
for myself,” and DuQuesne turned 
to the others; nodding at them as 
though he had left them only min- 
utes before. He was no whit embar- 
rassed or ill at ease; nor conscious of 
any resentment or ill-will directed at 
him. He was actually as unconcerned 
as, and bore himself very much 
like, a world-renowned specialist 
called into consultation on an un- 
usually difficult case. 

Before the situation could become 
strained, the three Rayseenian wom- 
en came into the big conference 
room and approached the confer- 
ence table — a table forty feet long 
and three feet wide. 

Their faces were white; their eyes 
were wide and staring. All three 
were doped to the ears. “Doctor 
Seaton,” Madam Barlo said, “you 
will cover the top of this table with 
one large sheet of paper, please?” 

Seaton donned his helmet and a 



sheet of drafting paper covered ex- 
actly the table’s top, adhering to It 
as though glued down. 

“You mean to say, Dc^, you’re 
going along with this magic flum- 
mery?” one of die Jelmi asked. 

“I certainly am,” Seaton said. 
“You will leave the room until thii 
test is over. So will everyone elM 
with a mind dosed . to what these 
women are trying to do.” The scof- 
fer and two other Jelmi walked to- 
ward the door and Seaton quirked 
an eyebrow at DuQuesne. 

“Fm staying,” that worthy said. 
“I can’t say that Fm a hundred per 
cent sold; but Fm interested enough 
to give it a solid try.” 

The two older women stationed 
themselves, one at each end of the 
table; Kay-Lee stood at her mother's 
right, holding in her hand a red-ink 
ballpoint at least a foot long. 

Majestic Fodan, the Chief of the 
Five of Norlamin, stood behind Ma- 
dame Barlo, but did not touch her; 
Drasnik and Sacner Carfon stood 
similarly behind Grand Dame Baflo 
and Kay-Lee. Each of the three 
women rubbed a drop of something 
(it was actually Seaton’s citrated 
blood) between thumb and forefin- 
ger and Madame Barlo said: 

“You will all look fixedly at any 
one of the six of us and think of oar 
success with everything that in yoa 
lies. Help us with all your might to 
succeed; give us your total mental 
strength. Kay-Lee, daughter, the time 
is . now!” 

R eaching across the end of tho 
table, Kay-Lee began to write • 
column eighteen inches wide; tho 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



143 




height of which was to be the thirty- 
six-inch width of the table. When 
she got to the middle of the fourth 
line, however, a man gasped in as- 
tonishment and the pen’s point stop- 
ped. This Jelm, a mathematician, 
had let his eyes slip from the oper- 
ator to the paper — and what he saw 
was high — very high! — math! Ma- 
thematics of a complexity that none 
of those women, by any possible 
stretch of the imagination, could 
know anything about! 

‘‘Quit peeking!” Seaton snarled. 
“You’re lousing up the whole deal! 
Concentrate! Think, dammit, 
THINK!” 

Everyone resumed thinking and 
Kay-Lee resumed writing. She wrote 
smoothly and effortlessly, with the 
precision and with almost the speed 
of the operating point of a geometric 
lathe. 

She wrote the first column 
and the second and the third and 
the fourth — six feet by three feet 
erf tightly packed equations and other 
mathematical shorthand. Then came 
twelve feet of exquisitely detailed 
“wiring” diagram. Then, covering 
all the rest of the paper, came work- 
ing drawings of and meticulously de- 
tailed specifications for machines that 
no one there had ever heard of. 

Then all three women collapsed. 
As well they might; they had work- 
ed without a letup for three hours. 

Men and women sprang to their 
aid with restoratives, and they began 
to recover. 

“Mister Fodan,” Madlyn Mannis 
said then, coming up to the Chief 
of the Five arm-in-arm with Ste- 
phanie de Marigny. Her usually vi- 



vid face was strangely pale. “1 can 
understand Hunkie here having a 
place in a brawl like this, she’s got 
half the letters in the alphabet after 
her name, but what good could I do? 
Possibly? I only went to school ona 
day in my life and that day it rain- 
ed and the teacher didn’t come.” 
“Formal education does not mat- 
ter, child; it is what you intrinsi- 
cally are that counts. You and your 
friend Charles are two perfectly 
matched male and female poles ot 
tremendous power. You felt your 
paired power at work. I’m sure.” 
“Wel-1-1, I felt something.'* Mad- 
lyn looked up at her Charley, her 
eyes full of question marks. “My 
whole brain was full of . we^ 
it was all kind of spizzly, like cham- 
pagne tastes.” And: 

“That’s it exactly,” van der Gleist 
agreed. 

Kay-Lee, fully recovered now, 
looked in surprise at some of the 
equations she had written, then turn- 
ed to Sacner Carfon. “Did it come 
out all right?” she asked hopefully. 
“Oh, I hope it did!” 

“I think so,” the porpoise-man re- 
plied. “At least, all of it I can un- 
derstand makes sense.” 

The T-8 engineer stared at Kay- 
Lee. “But didn’t you know what yon 
were doing?” 

“Of course she didn’t.” Again 
Madame Barlo did the talking. 
“None of us did, consciously. We 
are not masters of The Power, but 
Its servants. We are merely Its tools; 
the agents through which It does Its 
work.” 

And, off to one side, Dorothy was 
saying, “Dick, those women actually

are witches! I liked Kay-Lee, too . 
but real, live, practicing witches! I 
got goose bumps as big as peas. I 
don’t believe in witchcraft, darn it!” 
“I don’t either. That is, I never 
did before . but what else are 
you going to call it now?” 

XXVI 

Project Rho 

T he mathematicians and physical 
scientists began at once to studv 
atke wealth of new data. Drasnik, the 
First of Psychology, after conferring 
with Roban, with Sacner Carfon and 
with each of the three witches in 
turn, actually rushed over to the 
group of Tellurians. It was the first 
time Seaton had ever seen an ex- 
cited Norlaminian. 

“Ah, youths of Tellus, I thank 
you!” he enthused. “I thank you 
nnmensely for the inestimable pri- 
vDege of meeting the ladies Barlo! 
They possess a talent that is indu- 
bitably of the most tremendous — ” 
'^Talent?” Dorothy snorted. “Do 
jrou call witchcraft a talent? Why, 
tile very idea of it makes me . .” 
She paused. 

“Uh-huh, me too,” Madly n agreed 
fervently. “If I have to believe in 
practicing witches I’ll go not-so-slow- 
ly nuts.” 

“Witchcraft, my children? Bosh 
and fiddle-faddle! It is a talent. Ex- 
tremely rare and lamentably rudi- 
mentary in our part of the universe, 
yet these women have it in astound- 
ingly full measure. Unfortunately, 
you have no name for it except 
‘witchcraft’, which term has deplor- 



able connotations. It is the ability 
to . but the English has no words 
for that, either. But no matter, you 
have seen it in fine, full action Ro- 
ban and Sacner and I each have a 
very little of it . 

“But those women couldn’t possU 
bly have known anything about that 
kind of stuff!” Madlyn protested. 

“Of course they didp’t. Richard 
here and Tammon and Doctor Du- 
Quesne were the principal sources 
of information. But all three of them 
together lacked a great deal of hav- 
ing full knowledge, and the rest of 
us had very little indeed. While the 
comparison is lamentably loose, con- 
sider a larg^, finely cut jigsaw puz- 
zle. Seaton and DuQuesne and Tam- 
mon could each assemble an area. 
But no two of the three areas were 
contiguous, while none of the rest 
of us could fit more than a very 
few pieces together. But the ladies 
Barlo — particularly Grand Dame 
Barlo. who is a veritable powerhouse 
of strength — with some little help 
from the rest of us, exerted and 
directed The Power. The Power that, 
by tapping the reservoir of infinite 
knowledge, enabled the scribe Kay- 
Lee to fill in the missing parts of 
the puzzle.” 

“But why . .” Seaton began, but 
changed his mind “I see. You didn’t 
tell me anything about it because at 
that time it was both insignificant 
and inapplicable.” 

“That is correct. As I was sa* ing, 
our Roban, who has more of it than 
any other entity previously known, 
had perhaps the thousandth of what 
Kay-Lee, the weakest by far of the 
three, has. That is why he is Chief

©f the Five. And they tell me that 
there are other women of their race 
who also have this talent. Remark- 
able!” At this thought Draaoik, who 
had quieted down, became excited 
all over again. “When this is all over 
I shall go at once to Ray-See-Nee 
and study. Marvelous! They did not 
know even that it is a talent or that, 
when they learn, there will be no 
need to drug themselves into half- 
unconsciousness to employ it success- 
fully. Thank you again, young 
friends, for this wonderful opportun- 
ity. Marvelous!” and Drasnik scur- 
ried away. 

The Seatons and Madlyn and van 
der Gleiss stared after the Norlamin- 
ian until he was out of sight. They 
turned and stared at each other. 

“Well . ril ... be ... a 
. dirty . name,” Madlyn said. 

S eaton was pacing the floor, talk- 
ing to Dorothy, emitting a cloud 
of smoke from his battered and reek- 
ing briar. “I like to do my thinking 
with you, ace.” 

She chuckled. “At me, you mean, 
don’t you? That stuff is over my 
head like a beach umbrella.” 

“Don't fish, sweetie. You not only 
have a body and some bp.ir, but 
also a brain. One that fires on all 
sixteen barrels all the time.” 

She lapghed delightedly. “Thank 
you so much. You know that isn’t 
true, but you also know how I lap 
it up and purr. But to proceed. Dun- 
ark wants to smash them all with 
planets, the way he was going to 
smash Urvania. Martin and Peggy, 
after talking the way they did, craw- 
fished and are now talking about en- 



dosing the whole g t!axy in a stasis 
of time . .” 

“Huh? That’s news to me. How’s 
he figuring on doing it — did ho 
say?” 

“Uh-uh. I didn’t talk to him. Peg- 
gy says he isn’t going to say any- 
thing about it until he can present 
the package.” 

“He should live so long. But 
’scue, please; go ahead.” 

“Only one more. Foban, the sim- 
ple-minded old darling, wants to 
work with them. Convert them!” 

“Yeah. Make Christians of ’em. 
I’ve got a life-sized picture in tech- 
nicolor of anybody ever accomplish- 
ing that feat. The trouble is, every- 
body wants to do something differ- 
ent and none of their ideas are any 
good at all.” 

“Oh? I noticed that you haven’t 
been enthusiastic about any of them. 
Pretty grim, in fact. Why not?” 

“Because none of ’em will come 
even close to getting ’em all and 
this has got to be a one hundred 
point zero zero zero per cent clean-, 
up. You know how they operate on 
a cancer. They cut deep enough 
and wide enough to get it all. Every 
cell. If they don’t get it all it spreads 
all over the body and the patient 
dies. This is a cancer. It’s already 
eaten just about all of that galaxy 
by Chlora-typing planets wherever 
they go — or rather, enslaved hu- 
mans are doing it for them — and 
it’s spreading fast. And when that 
galaxy begins to get crowded they 
won’t just jump to one other; they’ll 
go for hundreds or thousands of 
galaxies and there goes the ball 
game. So that cancer has got to be

•perated on before it spreads any 

fcrther.” 

D orothy’s face began to pale. “By 
that analogy you mean destroy 
the whole galaxy 1 How can such a 
thing be possible? It can’t possibly 
be possible!” 

He told her how the operation 
could be performed. That apparatus 
that the Barlo women had dredged 
up out of nowhere had a lot of ca- 
pabilities that did not appear on the 
surface. Blackie DuQuesne had per- 
ceived one set of those possibilities, 
and he and Blackie had been work- 
ing on the hardware. They were 
calling it Project Rho. 

Her face, already pale, turned 
white as he talked; and when he 
had finished: 

“Project . Rho,” she breathed. 
“How utterly horrible! And yet . 
I never dreamed . have you talked 
to Martin yet?” 

“No. You first. I don’t want to 
even think about pushing that kind 
of a button without being sure 
you’re standing at my back.” 

“I’ll do better than that, Dick.” 
She looked him steadily in the eye. 
“I’ll take half of it My finger will 
be right beside yours on that but- 
ton.” 

“You are an ace, ace. As maybe 
I’ve said once before.” 

“Uh-huh, at least once — but we’re 
one, rernember?” 

After a moment she went on, “But 
we can’t possibly sell the Norlamin- 
ians any such bill of goods as that.” 
“I’ll say we can’t. They’d cry their 
eyes out all over the place. Or wait. 
When they find out that they can’t 



stop it, they’ll help save the human 
planets, which will be all to the 
good; the witches can use the help. 
But basically, the grand slam will 
be up to DuQuesne and his Fena- 
chrone and the witches and Mart 
and me. Even Mart will need some 
persuasion. I’m afraid; and you’ll 
have to really work on Peg. She’ll 
simply have a litter of kittens.” 
“Why, Dick; what a way to talk!” 
She smiled in spite of herself, but 
sobered quickly. “She’ll- come 
around. I’m sure; she’ll have to. But 
Dick, is it actually physically possi- 
ble? It’s so huger 

“Definitely. You see, we’ll be op- 
erating in a Gunther universe, so 
that mass as such won’t enter and 
power will be no problem. All we 
have to do is build an apparatus 
to alter the properties of space 
around and throughout the object to 
be moved — altering those properties 
in such a way as to make its three- 
dimensional attributes incompatible 
with those of its . .” 

She stopped him with an upraised 
hand. “Hold it! Wait up, please. 
We’ll dispense with the high math, 
if you don’t mind. It’s the sheer size 
of the thing that scares me witless.” 
Seaton did grin then. “Well, 
you’ve always known that making 
things bigger and better is the fond- 
est thing I am of. But we know 
exactly how to do it, and I think 
we can get it done before the Nor- 
laminians finish theirs. But Du- 
Quesne should be about ready to 
take off. I’ll flip myself over there 
and see.” 

He did so and said, “How’re you 
doing Blackie?”

IF 




"A few minutet yet to finish final 
checking. I’ve been thinking. What 
kind of a celestial object will that 
galaxy be when we get done with 
k? Not a quasi-stellar, certainly: 
that’s only a star with the energy of 
a hundred thousand million stars. 
This will be a galaxy with the ener- 
gy of a hundred thousand million 
galaxies — the energy of an entire 
universe.” 

“Yeah. Something new, I’d say. 
It’ll give some astronomers a thrill, 
some day. But what I can’t compute 
is, whether or not it will sterilize 
the interstellar space of that galaxy,” 
Seaton said. 

“Well, if it doesn’t, you might put 
the Osnomians and Urvanians on it. 
Keep ’em from thinking about fight- 
ing each other.” 

“You know, Blackie, I’d thought 
of doing exactly that? ‘Great minds’ 
and so forth. ‘Bye now; be seein’ 
ya,” and Seaton flipped himself 
back home. 

E n route to his destination — bar- 
ren planet in a star-cluster on 
the opposite side of the galaxy from 
the Skylark of Valeron — DuQuesne 
again went into a huddle with Slee- 
met. 

“So far, you’ve done a job,” he 
began. “What I told you to do — 
what I knew how to do — and done 
if well. But nothing else. Now I 
want something more than that. 
Something you can do, if you will, 
that I can’t. As you know, I’ve made 
arrangements so that in case of my 
death this whole planetoid goes up 
in an atomic blast. That was to keep 
you from killing me and making off 



with it. The same thing will happen, 
though, if those Chlorans kill me in 
the fracas that’s coming. It would 
seem as though that fact would be 
enough to make you make an hon- 
est-to-God effort to be sure that 
they don't kill me by doing your 
damnedest to help me kill them. 
Mentally. Both you and the Chlorans 
know more about one phase of that 
than I do — as yet. So, as added 
inducement to really top effort, if 
you’ll really tear into it on this 
Project Rho I’ll teach you everything 
I know that you can take. And I’ll 
help you build any kind of space- 
craft you want before you leave; 
one even as big as this one. What 
do you say?” 

Sleemet’s strange eyes glowed. “If 
you will go mind to mind with ma 
on that I can now assure you of 
such cooperation as no member of 
my race has ever given to any non- 
Fenachrone form of life,” he de- 
clared; and DuQuesne handed him 
a headset. 

It wasn’t easy, not even for suck 
an accomplished liar as Marc C. 
DuQuesne was, to make the four- 
dim gizmo very much more incom- 
prehensible than it actually was; but 
he accomplished the feat — and he 
actually did give Sleemet practically 
everything else. 

The DQ went into a one-day orbit 
above one point of an immense plain 
of the barren planet that was its 
goal. A plain some ten thousand 
square miles of which became forth- 
with an Area of Work. Enormous 
mechanisms sprang into being, by 
means of which DuQuesne and sev- 
eral hundred top-bracket Fenachrone 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE

engineers sent gigantic beams of 
force hurtling across the galaxy to 
the Skylark of Valeron and to hun- 
dreds of thousands of other micro- 
metrically determined points. 

But not Sleemet. That wight, 
knowing now almost everything that 
DuQuesne knew, was working in his 
•wn private laboratory — working 
with all the power of his tremendous 
mind on the various mental aspects 
•f the battle of giants to come. 

H our after hour, Crane worked 
in his master control at the 
iNise of the Brain, with Madame 
Barlo and Drasnik and Margaret, 
etch wearing an extra-complex head- 
iet, sitting close to him. They were 
mapping and modeling three gal- 
mdes, on such a large scale that 
iie vast ‘‘tank’* of the Skylark of 
Valeron was millions of times too 
•mall. They were using a discus- 
Aaped-volume of open space some 
ten light-years in diameter and three 
Kght-years thick. 

Galaxy DW-427-LU was already 
meticulously in place; its every ce- 
lestial body being represented by a 
characteristically shaped and charac- 
teristically colored light. “Above” 
Galaxy DW-427-LU and “below” it 
(the terms are used in the explana- 
tory sense only; “on one side of’ and 
“on the other side of” could be used 
Just as well) as close to it as pos- 
sible, two other galaxies were being 
modeled; each as nearly like DW- 
427-LU in size and shape as could 
be found in that part of the First 
Universe. They were so ctbse to- 
gether that in many places the three 
models actually interpenetrated. 



Now m ihe :>paL:e-time continuum 
of the strictly material — the ple- 
num in which we ungifted human 
beings live and which our friends the 
semanticists would have us believe 
is the only one having any reality — 
the map is not the territory. That 
is taken as being axiomatic. In the 
demesne of The Talent, however, 
known to some scholars as psionics 
and to scoffers as magic or witch- 
craft, the map is — and definitely! 
— the territory. 

Thus, as Madame Barlo and Dras- 
nik, those two matched poles of tre- 
mendous power; and Crane, the su- 
perlatively able coordinator and his 
matching pole Margaret; and that 
immense Brain — as these five la- 
bored together, the “map” (in this 
case the meticulously accurate space- 
chart) became filled with tendrils 
and filaments of psionic force, con- 
necting models of suns with models 
of suns and those of planets with 
those of planets. And as those join- 
ings occurred in the map, the same 
joinings occurred in the actual gal- 
axies out in deep space. 

Those joinings were invisible, it is 
true, and intangible, and indetect- 
able to any physical instrument. But 
they were nevertheless as real as 
was the almost infinite power from 
which they sprang. 

The other pairs of psiontists were 
also hard at work. Roban and Grand 
Dame Barlo, Sacner Carfon and 
Kay-Lee, Charles van der Gleiss and 
Madlyn Mannis, Mergon and his 
Luloy, Tammon and Sennlloy — all 
were shooting heavy charges fast and 
flawlessly straight. And as all those 
matched pairs labored, and as the 



150 



IF 




automatics of pure psionic force 
they produced reproduced them- 
selves in geometric ratio, the inter- 
galactic couplings increased at a rate 
that was that ratio squared. 

Seaton was fantastically busy, too. 
He was deep in his controller, with 
Dorothy and Stephanie de Marigny, 
both helmeted, one on each side of 
him. Dorothy, was, of course, his 
matched pole of power; Stephanie 
was his link to DuQuesne. He, too, 
was operating a ten-thousand-square- 
mile Area of Work with the speed 
of thought and he was not making 
any mistakes. It is true that the 
Skylark of Valeron was the biggest 
thing he had ever built before, and 
that the members with which he was 
working now were parsecs instead of 
inches long. Nevertheless each one 
fitted perfectly into place and every 
one that was supposed to connect 
with anything of DuQuesne’s con- 
nected perfectly therewith. 

A fter many hours of this furiously 
grinding work, a myriad of hells 
began to break out, at the rate of 
hundreds of thousands per second. 
Of hells, that is, infinitely hotter 
than anything imaginable by man. 
Of super-novae, no less. 

In one galaxy. A, a large hot sun 
vanished. 

It reappeared instantaneously — 
with no lapse of time whatever — 
close beside the sun of a Chloran- 
dominated solar system in Galaxy 
DW-427-LU. 

And in that same no-time the Tcl- 
1 US-Type planet in the Chloran syg- 
tem vanished therefrom and reap- 
peared in a precisely similar orbit 



around a Type G dwarf sun in Gal- 
axy B, the third galaxy in the psion- 
tists’ tremendous working model. 

And those two suns in the Chlor- 
an solar system in Galaxy DW-427- 
LU, with photospheres in contact 
and with intrinsic velocities not only 
diametrically opposed but increased 
horribly by their mutual force of 
gravitation, crashed together in direct 
central impact and splashed with tre- 
mendous force. 

Except for the heat, the collision 
might have lasted for a long time. 
But heat was the all-important fac- 
tor — the starkly incomprehensible 
heat of hundreds of millions of 
Centigrade degrees. 

Each of those suns was already an 
atomic furnace in precise equili- 
brium; generating and radiating the 
energy of some five million tons per 
second of matter being converted 
completely into energy. Thus there 
was no place for the added energy 
of billions of tons of matter to go. 
It could not be absorbed and it could 
not be radiated. Therefore the whole 
enormous mass of super-hot, super- 
dense material began to go into the 
long series of ultra-atomic explo- 
sions that is the formation of a 
supersuper-nova — the most utterly, 
the most fantastically violent display 
of pure, raw energy known to or 
possible in the universe of man. 

Flares and prominences of this 
insanely detonating material were 
hurled upward and outward for mil- 
lions upon millions of miles. Shock- 
wave after shock-wave, so hellishly 
hot as to be invisible for days, raged 
and raved spherically outward; con- 
verting instantaneously all the flat- 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE

sam in their paths into their own 
unknown composition or atomic and 
subatomic debris. Planets lasted a 
Httle longer. Oceans and mountain 
ranges boiled briefly; after which 
each world evaporated comparatively 
slowly, as does a drop of water rid- 
ing a cushion of its own steam on a 
hot steel plate. 

And the sphere of annihilation, ra- 
vening outward with unabated fero- 
city, reached and passed the outer- 
most limits of the Chloran solar 
system and kept on going . 

On and on . 

And on . 

Until there came to pass an event 
which not even Seaton, not even 
Madame Barlo herself had foreseen 
. , . and an event which nearly can- 
celed all their efforts and their lives 
as well; for the Chlorans were not 
left without resources even in the 
destruction of their galaxy . 

XXVII 

DuQuesne to the Rescue 

A s has been said, the Chlorans of 
Galaxy DW-427-LU as a race 
were more conversant with the Tal- 
ent than were any of the human or 
near-human races of the First Gal- 
axy: that is, with the phases or fac- 
ets of it that had to do with the 
remarkable hypnotic qualities of their 
minds. Thus their mathematicians 
were more or less familiar with no- 
space-no-time theory, and some of 
the Greater Great Ones had played 
with it a little more or less for fun, 
in practice. Since they had never had 
any real use for it as a weapon, how- 



ever, it had never been fully devel- 
oped. 

Thus there were no detectors or 
feeling for that type of attack. ‘Tt 
was not sixth-order, but no-space- 
no-time, which is no-order”. Thus 
millions upon millions of Chloran 
planets were destroyed without any 
intelligent entity either giving or re- 
ceiving warning that an attack was 
being made. 

And that was the way Richard 
Seaton wanted it. This was not a 
game; not a chivalric tournament. 
This was a matter of life and death, 
in which the forces of human civili- 
zation, outnumbered untold billions 
to one, needed all the advantage 
they could get. 

Unfortunately for Seaton’s desires 
and expectations, the Chlorans had 
a Galactic Institute for Advanced 
Study. 

In common with all such institu- 
tions everywhere, its halls harbored 
at least one devotee of any name- 
able subject, however recondite or 
arcane that subject might be. So 
there was one old professor of ad- 
vanced optical hypnosis who, as a 
hobby, had been delving into no- 
space-no-time for a couple of hun- 
dred years. He did not feel the light 
preliminary surveying tendrils of the 
human witches; but when the big 
Gunther beams began to come in 
he became interested fast and got 
busy fast. 

He called his first assistant and 
his most advanced student — the lat- 
ter a Greater Great One who was 
also interested in and a possessor of 
the Talent and thus familiar with the 
mysterious power of the number 



152 



IF 




three — and, synchronizing their 
three minds, they traced those beams 
to the Skylark of Valeron and the 
DQ, and to Seaton and to Crane and 
the DuQuesne. 

“First,” the professor told his two 
weaker fellows, “we will attune our 
Union of Three to theirs and break 
it apart with blasts of psionic force. 
Then, each of us having tuned to 
one of the separated strands, we will 
kill the three murderers forthwith.” 

And the Chlorans proceeded to 
do their best to bring this event 
about — and their best was very po- 
tent indeed. 

If things did not quite work out 
the way they had planned it, it was 
no fault of the individual Chlorans. 
Their minds were fully capable of 
killing three “murderers” at a dis- 
tance. The first enormous surge of 
mental energy they thrust into the 
Tellurian union of minds destroyed 
its fabric. The coupling of “poles 
of power” was wrenched asunder. 
The individual minds of the opera- 
tors were left alone against the 
Chloran thrust . and each of the 
three Chlorans selected one of the 
three mightiest intellects of their 
enemies and commanded it to die. 

In that moment, Seaton, Crane 
and DuQuesne were seized and pin- 
ned. The minds that thundered de- 
struction at them were not merely 
of great intrinsic power, carefully 
trained; they were backed up by all 
the million-year evolution of Chlor- 
an science, aided by the impact of 
total surprise. 

The three helpless Tellurians were 
helpless before they knew what hit 
them. 



But they did not die. What saved 
them was DuQuesne’s bargain with 
the Fenachrone. Sleemet had had a 
few microseconds’ warning by that 
Fenachrone ferocity, and the back- 
ing of every last member of his feral 
race. 

His primary purpose was, of 
course, the defense of DiiQuesne’s 
life — not for the sake of DuQuesne, 
to be sure, but for the protection of 
the Fenachrone. He succeeded. Du- 
Quesne’s rigidity melted and he was 
back in control of himself, his own 
great intellect reinforcing Sleemet’s 
counterblows. The two of them had 
enough psionic power left over to 
help Seaton and Crane . but not 
enough. The blow had been too 
powerful and too sudden. 

Both Seaton and Crane slumped 
bonelessly to the floor of the control 
room, leaving their controllers emp- 
ty and idle. 

I n that moment the one great pole 
of strength left to humankind 
was — Dr. Marc C. DuQuesne. 

To Dorothy Seaton, that moment 
was pure horror. It was every ter- 
rible fear she had ever thought of, all 
come to pass at once: Seaton dis- 
abled, perhaps dying; DuQuesne in 
control of all the mighty resources 
of the Skylark. Dorothy shrieked 
and leaped from her chair — 

And was stopped in her tracks by 
DuQuesne’s shout, crackling out of 
a* speaker to emphasize his hard- 
driven thoughts: 

“Dorothy! Margaret! Quit it! Pick 
up your loads and carry ’em. Pole to 
me!” 

And Dorothy hesitated, irresolute.

torn between her love tor Seaton and 
her urgent duty to help against the 
Chlorans, while the whole vast net 
of human mental energies wavered 
and hung in the balance. 

**Nowr snarled DuQuesne, the 
thought like a lash. “Move! To hell 
with the dead — ” Dorothy scream- 
ed again — you* re still alive! But 
you won’t be long if you goof off!” 
Rapidly he scanned the quavering 
net. “You Barlo women and your 
poles! Drop what you’re doing and 
locate this interference for me — 
fast! All of you — find it for me so 
I can slug it! Hunkie? Yeah — good 
girl! Stay with it just as you are!” 

“But DuQuesne,” Dorothy pro- 
tested, “I’ve got to . .” 

“Oh, helir DuQuesne wrenched 
out, every nuance of his tone show- 
ing t|je tremendous strain under 
which he was laboring. “Savant 
Sennlloy! You can’t be spared from 
there, but have you got a couple of 
girls who can tune themselves to 
me?” 

“Yes, Doctor DuQuesne.” Neither 
she or any other Jelm aboard under- 
stood why Seeker Sevance of Yylm- 
ny had been masquerading as Doc- 
tor Marc C. DuQuesne of Tellus 
when he received his Call. They all 
knew, however, that it had to do 
with his Seeking; hence, none of 
them did anything to interfere with 
it. “We have many very good men- 
talists in our party.” 

“Fine! Have two of ’em relieve 
these two weak sisters here — and 
fast!” 

“Here we are, sir,” two thoughts 
came in, in unison. And two power- 
ful female Jelman minds — the 



minds of two girls with whom Ibi 
was already very well acquainted — 
fitted themselves snugglingly to hli 
and picked up the loads that the two 
Earthwomen had been unable I# 
carry. 

It was not that either of those 
Earthwomen was weak. Both were 
tremendously strong; mentally and 
psychically. Both disliked DuQuesne 
so intensely, however, that it was 
psychologically impossible for either 
of them to work with him. Of 
course, he regarded that fact itself 
as an extreme weakness. Sentiment 
was as bad as sentimentality, he 
held, and both bored him to tears. 

“Ah, that’s better.” DuQuesne’s 
thought was a sigh of relief. “That 
makes it at least possible.” 

And it did. DuQuesne and his 
two new assistants did not do much 
to keep the wave of destruction 
sweeping through Galaxy DW-427- 
LU, but he and they, with a lot of 
very high-powered Fenachrone help, 
did hold the Chloran attackers at 
bay until the three witches and the 
three warlocks found the planet up- 
on which the Chloran Galactic Insti- 
tute of Advanced Study was located. 
Then, with locked teeth and hard- 
set muscles and sweating face, he 
made the superhuman effort requir- 
ed to drive that three-man beam 
single-handed and keep those three 
rabid Chloran attackers at bay be- 
sides. 

By a miracle of coordination and 
timing he did it — and practically 
collapsed when all attack and all 
necessity of resistance ceased. The 
Chloran Institute simply ceased to 
be. Its members died. DuQuesne re- 



154 



IF 




covered so quickly that no one else 
except the two Jelman girls knew 
that he had been affected at all. 

‘"Dorothy! Margaret! Break it up!” 
he snapped. Doctors had been work- 
ing on Seaton and Crane for min- 
utes. Both were beginning to recover 
consciousness. Neither, apparently, 
had been permanently damaged; and 
both their wives were making en- 
thusiastically joyful noises. “Come 
on, come on, take them home to do 
your slobbering over them. The rest 
of us have work to do — or do you 
expect us to hold this demolition job 
up until they organize another three- 
some to go to the mat with us?” 

S tretchermen carried Seaton and 
Crane away; Dorothy and Mar- 
garet went along. The Chloran blow 
at the lives of the two Skylarkers 
had been deadly and fast, but it had 
not succeeded — quite. 

And the “demolition job” went on. 
In the great light-years-thick 
“tank” that was the psiontists’ work- 
ing model of the three galaxies they 
were manipulating, lights were wink- 
ing out and reappearing as stars and 
planets were hurled through four- 
dimensional curves to new orbits and 
positions. Already Galaxy A — the 
“raw-material” source that was being 
used for a supply of suns — was 
visibly dimmer, visibly poorer in 
stars. Tens of millions of them had 
already been stolen away and tossed 
through four-space into Chloran suns 
in Galaxy DW-427-LU. And when 
they reappeared, in a head-on colli- 
sion course with those Chloran suns, 
and struck, and destroyed them- 
selves in the titanic outflow of en- 



ergies that produced super-nova 
blasts, the model of Galaxy DW- 
427-LU showed another tiny but 
blindingly bright flare — and anoth- 
er — and another — 

There were more than fifty thou- 
sand million suns to move, in all. 
As the first targets had been the 
strongest and most dangerous Chlor- 
an systems, resistance soon ceased 
to matter; the task became monot- 
onous, exhausting and mind-deaden- 
ing. 

To the Chlorans, of course, it was 
something else again. They died ia 
uncounted trillions. The greeny-yel- 
low soup that served them for air 
boiled away. Their halogenous flesh 
was charred, baked and desiccated 
in the split-second of the passing of 
the wave front from each exploding 
double star, moments before their 
.planets themselves began to seetho 
and boil. Many died unaware. Most 
died fighting. Some died in terrible, 
frantic efforts to escape . 

But they all died. 

And for each sun that DuQuesne’i 
remorseless net located and flung 
into the Chloran galaxy, an oxygen- 
bearing, human-populated planet was 
snatched out of the teeth of the re- 
sulting explosion and carried through 
four-space into the safetv of Galaxy 
B, there to slip quietlv into orbit 
around a pre-selected, hospital sun. 
No human world was destroyed in 
all of Galaxy DW-427-LU. 

It went on and on . 

And then it was over. 

M arc DuQuesne rose, stretched 
and yawned. “TTiat’s all. Kvery- 
body (fis^ssed,” he said, and at

once the vast psiontic net ceased to 
be. He was alone for the first time 
in many hours. 

His face was lined, his eyes deep- 
er and darker than ever. Apart from 
that there was no sign of the great 
extermination he had just conducted. 
He was simply Marc DuQuesne. The 
man who slew a galaxy looked no 
different after the deed than he had 
before. 

He allowed his sense of percep- 
tion to roam for a moment about 
die “working model”. In Galaxy A, 
where billions of suns had gone 
through the stellar cycle of evolu- 
tion for billions of years, there was 
•carcely a corporal’s guard of pri- 
maries left. It was a strange, almost 
a frightening sight. For with the loss 
of the suns the composition of the 
galaxy had changed to something 
never before seen in all the plenum 
of universes. Nearly every sun had 
had planets; nearly every planet re- 
mained behind when its sun was 
stolen. Now they roamed at ran- 
dom — uncontrolled, barren, unin- 
habited — lacking not only the light 
and heat of their primaries, but 
freed from their gravitational reins 
as well. 

Galaxy B, on the other hand, 
looked quite normal — in the “work- 
ing model”. The planets it had ac- 
quired, both from the exploded 
Chloran suns and from the looted 
solar systems of Galaxy A, were not 
even visible. Galactically speaking, 
it was essentially unchanged; the ad- 
ditional mass of a few billion planets 
did not matter, and each of the new 
planets was already in orbit around 
a friendly sun. There would be re- 



adjustments, of course. It would be 
necessary to keep a watch on the 
developments of each affected solar 
system, over a period of years. But 
that was no problem of Marc Du- 
Quesne’s. 

But the Chloran galaxy! What was 
it? 

In the “working model” it was 
rapidly becoming a single, light- 
years-thick concentration of living 
flame. In the reality it was even 
huger, even more deadly. A name 
would be invented for it some day 
— quasi-stellar? Or something great- 
er still? 

But that, too, was no longer a 
concern for Marc DuQuesne. He 
dropped from his mind, without a 
qualm, the memory of the trillions 
of lives he had taken, the billions 
of worlds he had dislocated. He ig- 
nored the question of Richard Ball- 
inger Seaton, now stirring back to 
consciousness, to worry — and ulti- 
mately, to reassurance — somewhere 
on the Valeron. He had more press- 
ing business to take care of. Person- 
al business. And to DuQuesne that 
was the most pressing of all. 

Qhrugging his shoulders, he sent 
O Stephanie de Marigny a tight- 
beamed thought: 

“Hunkie — some time before you 
go back to Washington, can I flip 
you over to the DQ for a private 
conference that we know will be 
private?”

changed tone instantly and went on, 
“Of course, Blackie. Any time. Just 
give me time to pack a toothbrush 
and my pajamas. Top Secret, or can 
you give me a hint to allay my, 
^‘satiable curiosity?”' 

^'“Hint; large economy size. Bwf 
time 1 think of what those damnel 
observers ase dohig to you — feed- 
ing a nund Oke ycun with an eye- 
dropper instead of a seventy-two- 
hich pipeline — it makes me madder 
and madder. I can give you every- 
thing that Seaton, I, Crane and half 
the Norlaminians know, and give it 
to you in five hours.” 

“You can what?** The thought was 
a mental scream. She licked her lips, 
gulped twice, and said, “In that case 
we needn’t wait for either tooth- 
brush or pajamas. Do it now.” 

He laughed deeply. “I wasn’t sure 
tihat would be your attitude, but I’m 
glad it is. But I can’t do it this 
minute. I have to help SIcemet fin- 
ish building his planetoid, watch him 
very carefully for a while on course 
and do a couple of other crash-pri 
chores. Three or four days, prob- 
ably. Say Saturday, seventeen 
hours?” 

“That’ll be fine, Blackie, and 
thanks. I’ll be here with my ears 
pinned back and my teeth filed 
down to needle points.”

Emperor 

T he Fenachrone had taken off and 
DuQuesne had watched them 
go, taking extreme precautions — 
none of which, it turned out, had 



been necessary — that they did not 
eliminate either him or the rest of 
the party as soon as it became safe 
for them to do so. He had taken 
Stephanie de Marigny and all her 
belongings aboard, saying that he 
gjiB going close enough to Tellus so 
it would be no trouble at all 
to drop her off there. And lastly, 
when Seaton and Crane had insist^ 
upon thanking him for what he had 
done: 

“Save it,” he had sneered. “Re- 
member, that time on X-World, 
what I told you to do with that kind 
of crap? That still goes,” and he 
had taken off at full touring drive 
on course one seven five Universal. 
This course, which would give the 
First Galaxy a near miss, was the 
most direct route to a galaxy that 
was distant indeed; the galaxy lying 
on the extreme southern rim of the 
First Universe; the galaxy in which 
the DQ had been built; the galaxy 
that DuQuesne had surveyed so 
thoroughly and which he intended to 
rule. 

DuQuesne and Stephanie were in 
the DQ's control room, which was 
an exact duplicate of the Skylark of 
Valeron*s. He placed her in the seat 
that on the Valeron was Crane’s, 
showed her how to elevate herself 
into his own station. 

“Oh,” she said. “You’re going to 
give me the whole gigantic Brain?” 

“That’s the best and easiest way 
to do it. I boiled down about ten 
thousand lifetimes of knowledge and 
experience into ten half-hour ses- 
sions. The ten tapes on that player 
there are coded instructions for the 
Brain — what to give you and how.

There are minds who could take the 
whole jolt in seconds, but yours and 
mine aren’t that type — yet. But 
you’ll get it all in five hours. Every 
detail. It’ll shock you all hell’s worth 
and it’ll scare you right out of your 
panties, but it won’t hurt you and 
it won’t damage your brain. Yours 
is one of the very few human brains 
that can take it. I ll start it and in 
five hours I’ll be back. Ready?” 

“As much so as I ever will be, I 
guess. Go.” 

He started the player; and, after 
waiting a few minutes to be sure that 
everything was going as program- 
med, he left the room . 

H e came back in just as the ma- 
chine clicked off, lowered her 
“chair”, and lifted her to her feet. 

“Good — God — In — Heaven!” 
the gasped. Her skin, normally so 
dark, was a yellowish white; so 
pale that her scattered freckles stood 
out sharply, each one in bold relief. 

don’t ... I can’t ... I simply 
can’t grasp it! I know that I know 
it, but . .” She paused. 

He shook his head in sympathy. 
Which, for Marc C. DuQuesne, was 
a rare gesture indeed. “I know. I 
couldn’t tell you what it would be 
like — no possible warning can be 
enough. But that’s the bare mini- 
mum you’ll have to start with, and 
h won’t take you very long to as- 
similate it all. Ready for some talk?” 
“Not only ready. I’m eager. First, 
though, I want to give you a vote of 
full confidence. I’m sure that you’ll 
succeed in everything you try from 
now on; even to becoming Emperor 
Marc the First of some empire.” 



“Huh? Where did you get that?** 
“By reading between the lines. Do 
you think I’m stupid, it that why 
you gave me all this?” 

“Okay. You’ve always known, as 
an empirical, non-germane fact, that 
the Earth and all it carries isn’t even 
a flyspeck in a galaxy, to say noth- 
ing of a universe; but now you know 
and really understand just how little 
it actually does amount to.” 

She shuddered. “Yes. It’s . it’s 
appalling.” 

“Not when viewed in the proper 
perspective. I set out to rule Earth, 
yes; but after I began to learn some- 
thing I lost that idea in a hurry. For 
a long time now I haven’t wanted 
Earth or any part of it. Its medical 
science is dedicate<f whole-heartedly 
to the deterioration of the human 
race by devoting its every effort to 
the preservation of the lives of the 
unfit. In Earth’s wars its best men 
— its best breeding stock — are kill- 
ed. Earth simply is not worth sav- 
ing even if it could be saved; which 
I doubt. Neither is Norlamin. Not 
because its conquest is at present 
impossible, but because the Norla- 
minians aren’t worth anything, eith- 
er. All they do — all they can do — 
is think. They haven’t done anything 
constructive in their entire history 
and they never will. They’re such 
bred-in-th e-bone pacifists — look at 
the way the damned sissies acted in 
this Chloran thing — that it is psy- 
chologically impossible for any one 
of them to pull a trigger. No; Slee- 
met had the right idea. And Ravin- 
dau — you have him in mind?” 
“Vividly. Preserve the race — in 
his way and on his terms,**

“You’re a precislonist; that’s my 
idea exactly. To pick out a few hun- 
dred people — we won’t need many, 
as there are billions already where 
we’re going — as much as possible 
like us, and build a civilization that 
will be what a civilization ought to 
be.” 

T he girl gasped, but her eyes 
began to sparkle. ‘“In a distant 
galaxy*, as Ravindau said?” 

“Very distant. Clear out on the 
rim of this universe. The last galaxy 
out on the rim, in fact; five degrees 
east of Universal south.” 

“And you’ll be Emperor Marc the 
First after all. But you won’t live 
long enough to rule very much.” 
“You’re wrong, Steff. The ordin- 
ary people are already there, and it’s 
ridiculous for a sound and healthy 
body to deteriorate and die at a 
hundred. We’ll live ten or fifteen 
times that long, what with what I 
already know and the advances our 
medical science will make. Especial- 
ly with the elimination of the unfit.” 
“Sterilization, you mean?” 

“No; death. Don’t go soft on me, 
girl. There will be no second-class 
citizens, at least in the upper stra- 
tum. Testing for that stratum will 
be b^^ super-computer. Upper-stratum 
families will be fairly large.” 

“Families?” she broke in. “You’ve 
come to realize, then, that the family 
is the sine qua non of civilization?” 
“I’ve always known that.” Fore- 
stalling another interruption with a 
wave of his hand, he went on, “I 
know. I’ve never been a family man. 
On Earth or in our present cultures 
I would never become one. But skip-

ping that for the moment, it’s your 
turn now.” 

“I like it.” She thought in silence 
for a couple of minutes, then went 
on, “It must be an autocracy, of 
course, and you’re the man to make 
it work. The only flaw I can see is 
that even absolute authority can not 
make a dictated marriage either tol- 
erable or productive. It automatical- 
ly isn’t, on both counts.” 

“Who said anything about dictat- 
ed marriage? Free choice within the 
upper stratum and by test from the 
lower. With everybody good breed- 
ing stock, what difference will it 
make who marries whom?” 

“Oh. I see. That does it, of course. 
Contrary to all appearances, then, 
you actually do believe in love. The 
implication has been pellucidly clear 
all along that you expect . 

“‘Expect’ is too strong a word. 
Make it that I’m ‘exploring the pos- 
sibility of.” 

“I’ll accept that. You are explor- 
ing the possibility of me becoming 
your empress. From all the given 
premises, the only valid conclusion is 
that you love me. Check?” 

“The word ‘love’ has so many 
and such tricky meanings that it is 
actually meaningless. Thus, I don’t 
know whether I love you or not, in 
your interpretation of the term. If 
it means to you that I will jump off 
of a cliff or blow my brains out if 
you refuse, I don’t. Or that I’ll pine 
away and not marry a second best, 
I don’t. If, however, it means a lot 
of other things, I do. Whatever it 
means, will you marry me?” 

“Of course I will, Blackie. Fve 
loved you a long time.” END

CRY 





The Place Where Readers 
And Editor Meet . 



Dear Editor: 

After having just finished Pat- 
ron of the ArtSy I can’t understand 
why more ‘*Hue & Cry” isn’t made 
over Fred Saberhagen’s Berserker 
stories. 

People keep praising your longer 
and flashier Retief and Gree stor- 
ies. I can see why, because I think 
they are both terrific — and have 
been a Retief fan since January, 
1962 and The Yllian Way. But I 
haven’t seen even one letter (al- 
though I have missed a couple of 
issues) praising these short but 
great stories of the war of life vs. 
the berserker machines. The idea 
behind them all is fascinating and 
original, and each one is clear and 
well developed — an unusual quali- 
ty in stories of that length. More of 
them, please! 

Another good story from the 
same issue as Patron was We Hunt- 
ers of Men, The story was excellent 
and the curtain line was one of 
the best ever. A bad story from that 
issue was The Craterj and the art- 
work was worse. No more Nodel, 
huh? 



Congratulations on your longer 
format. I haven’t seen one of the 
bigger issues yet but I know it will 
be terrific. If is the best SciPi 
mag around, and you can’t get too 
much of a good thing! — Bill Reyn- 
olds, Jr., 336 Acre Lane, Hicksville, 
New York.

of the Red Shifty a Berserker nov-

Editor, 

* ♦ ♦ 

Dear Editor: 

You bring up an interesting 
point: I refer to the problem of get- 
ting readers to write in and tell 
you what they want in the maga- 
zine. There are a number of reasons 
why you will have a hard time get- 
ting such letters. First of all, tho 
majority of letter writers are in 
that little group of just about one 
thousand people who call themselves 
‘science fiction fandom’. That is not 
much use, because their interests 
are a closed-circle affair. So far as 
I have been able to find out, their 
opinions of Worlds of Tomorrow 
and IF are quite low. We come, then 



160 




H the problem of the greneral public. 

Daring the period of ^culture* in 
•eience fiction, the general public 
got a pretty raw deal. The letters 
they wrote to science-fiction editors, 
were usually answered insultingly, 
requesting the things they liked, 
I recall one editor publicly, in print, 
stating that such people were prob- 
ably perverts because they objected 
to an overload of sex in the stories. 
It really became a sad situation 
when the writers joined the editors 
in ‘telling off’ the readers. You 
can’t blame the readers for noi: real- 
ly believing you when you say you 
want their opinions. How to over- 
come it? Darned if I know. 

Of course, one of the problems of 
getting into contact with the readers 
is that very few of them read either 
the editorial column or ttio reader’s 
oriumn (when such is printed). 
Speaking personally, I read science- 
fiction for ten years (back in the 
thirties) before I was even aware 
ef the existence of the editorial or 
reader’s pages. I bought the maga- 
zines for the stories; the same rea- 
son most people ouy fictio'i maga- 
zines. When the fiction got too dull, 
I just stopped reading the magazine. 

While I am writing this, I might 
as well extend my comments. Do 
you remember why science-fiction 
magazines went to the digest size? 
Most people do not remember. It 
was the outgrowth of yells from 
science-fiction fandom for trimmed 
edges. A big uproar about nothing 
important. The magazines could not 
give trimmed edges at the large 
size without increasing the expense 
of the magazines. But it could be 
done at a smaller size; so we got 
‘digest’ magazines. Frankly, I do 
not think it was worth it. Good dis- 
play became impossible. I realize 



that Campbell tried to return to the 
large size. However, he tried it with 
trimmed edges and slick paper; a 
good way of pricing himself out of 
existence. From my point of view, 
a return to the untrimmed edges 
would do the pulp business a great 
deal of good. They might even start 
thinking, of the line as a money 
making business. 

Of course, there were also com- 
plaints from science-fiction fandom 
about the guy-girl-monster covers. 
This was also a very foolish objec- 
tion. The cover is a billboard. If it 
is not used as such it might as well 
be blank. The only value of a cover 
on a newsstand magazine is to at- 
tract attention in any way possible. 
If it can only be done by making 
the cover like a circus poster, then 
it should look like a circus poster. 
If a damsel in distress is the best 
way, then it should be use.';. A col- 
ored cover, alone, will not attract 
attention; nor will unusual circum- 
stances. Activity is important in a 
cover picture. The only way to pre- 
pare a cover display properly is to 
assume that the magazine is being 
seen for the first time by a person 
who has never heard of science- 
fiction. 

The truth is that the general pub- 
lic never has heard of science-fic- 
tion. The general term for the type 
of writing is still ‘that Buck Rogers 
stuff’. Only the writing profession 
knows the difference. Of course, 
basically, there is no difference. The 
basic pattern is the same; the dif- 
ference is only in the way you 
stretch it. Stretched in one direction, 
it becomes ‘social commentary*. 
Stretched in another direction, U 
becomes entertainment. It all de- 
pends on what you want to sell. I 
assume Galaxy is ‘social commen-

tary*, and Worlds of Tomorrow 
and IF are entertainment maga- 
zines. If the latter are entertain- 
ment magazines, they cannot be 
handled, visually, in the same man- 
ner as Galaxy. Illustrations in an 
entertainment magazine require 
lively action and clear cut artwork. 
A person looking for entertainment 
is not looking for subtlety. 

I suppose everybody has an opin- 
ion on this sort of thing. My opinion 
is based on six years of digging into 
the whys and whats of complaints 
1 heard in the publishing business 
about loss of readers. I questioned 
editors, writers, printers and dis- 
tributors. The final answer is rather 
peculiar. There is really nothing 
basically wrong with file publishing 
business, and the readers are still 
available for all tsrpes of reading 
material. Television, radio and the 
movies never did any damage to the 
publishing business. The only dam- 
age, if any, was In the fears that 
the aforementloiied mediums would 
hurt them. As a roouH, a great 
many publishers ehaiiged fiieir mer- 
chandising methods unnecessarily. 
It’s somethhig like file danger of 
ghosts: they ean*t hut you, but 
they sure can make you hurt your- 
self. 

Best of luck. — D. Bruce Berry, 
4564 North Malden Street, C^ileago, 
Illinois, 60640. 

• Actually, it’s probably too late 
for untrimming the edges to help 
anything — those big pulp press- 
es that used to chum out the shaggy 
books on the blotting-paper stock 
have long since been dismantled. 
But you make a lot of good points, 
and we’ll admit you’ve started us 
thinking. One effect: We’re going 
to take a l<mg, hard look at our 
policies ! — Bddtor. 



Dear Editor: 

As a fairly new subscriber, I 
think you would be doing a great 
service if you would print a short 
biography of the Retief stories in 
If. Also, please try getting Laumer 
to write a Retief serial. — James E. 
Turner, Pilot Knob, Missouri 63 ( 363 . 
• All right. See Page 14 — and 
surrounding territory. 

And that just about does it again. 
Our story for this issue by a writer 
never previously published any- 
where is Purpooo, by Edward V. 
Dong — ^whom we first met, a year 
or two ago, when we were invited 
to speak to the science-fiction club 
at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, 
where he was th«i an undergrad- 
uate in the engineering school. By 
the way, you all know, don’t you, 
that we do make a point to bring 
one brand new writer into every is- 
sue of If. We’ve recently brought a 
batch of them — ^from a high-school 
student, a folk singer, a mathemati- 
cian and a retired Navy officer, 
among others — ^but we’ll be buying 
a lot more. Maybe yours? 

And we’ve also recently bought 
some large clumps of material from 
some writers who are not at all 
brand-new. (This new large size 
eats up a lot of material!) Our 
next serial will be Robert A. Hein- 
lein’s now one; a B-I-G story, but 
we’re going to attempt to bring it 
to you intact. Following that, a 
great joy by Keith Laumer and 
Rosel G. Brown in collaboration, 
called Barthblood; following that, 
Algis Budrys’s first sf magazine 
serial, The Iron Thom. 

And the way — it is our per- 
sonal opinion that we have just 
named 1966’s Hugo winner — and 
maybe two of the runners-up, as 
well I— i^ditor.
