A nybody who listens in on 
gatherings of scientific peo- 
ple must have begun to notice 
a dismaying lack of communica- 
tion between Them and Us. It 
doesn’t help much if We are 
also scientists, too — not unless 
we are in the same line, maybe 
not even then! 

It isn’t just a matter of words 
like deoxyribonucleic acid (des- 
oxyribonucleic acid? Depends on 
where you come from). The 
mind has evolved a technique 
for that sort of thing. It may 
not be able to translate for you, 
but it registers a sort of burst 
of static that conveys the mes- 
sage, Unfamiliar term, meaning 
unknown, or, That one I don’t 
dig, boss, but he sure talks pret- 
ty. With luck you can then fi- 
gure out some sort of meaning 
from the context. If you’re not 
that lucky, at least you have the 
consolation that you may not 
know what they’re talking about 
but at least you know you don’t 
know it 

The real communications 



breakdown comes when the lan- 
guage sounds like something you 
ought to understand. “We were 
knitting all day, and when we 
got that cleaned up she started 
a cocktail party” sounds sensible 
enough . sort of. “We got to 
the white room but then we 
were nitpicking for half an hour 
and they couldn’t hold the chill- 
down” is almost as deceptive. Or 
try: “As long as Stockpile was 
only two or three Kahns. I 
wasn’t worried, but once it gets 
up near a Beach there’s trouble, 
right?” “Right,” you nod, and 
ask if anybody’s seen the new 
batting order for the San Fran-, 
cisco Giants. 

Of course, all this may be en 
claire for you. If you’re a cyber- 
neticist you may know that the 
first example refers to the bugs 
computers develop — according 
to N. Zvegintzov, “knitting” is 
the process of repetitively punch- 
ing tape, while a readout that is 
pure gibberish is called a “cock- 
tail party.” (Figures!) Anybody 
around Cape Kennedy knows

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

that a nitpicking hold is one in 
which assorted minor flaws are 
fixed, the white room is the last 
staging area before the astronaut 
enters his vehicle and a chill- 
down is the process of keeping 
liquid gases liquid. Those who 
attended the Pugwash confer- 
ences might recognize the Beach 
as that quantity of nuclear wea- 
pons which will kill half the 
Earth’s population by fallout 
(c urtesy of course, of Nevil 
Shute), a Kahn that smaller 
quantity sufficient to annihilate 
any given country (one Beach 
equals about 300 Kahns), and a 
Stockpile is a variable represent- 
ing actual quantity of nuclear 
weapons in being in the world at 
any particular time. (These 
terms are taken from Freeman 
J. Dyson, writing in The Bulletin 
of the Atomic Scientists .) 

No doubt some such short- 
hand is needed. You can’t ex- 
pect the Cape Kennedy people 
to call one of their body-func- 
tion telemeters an extinctospec- 
tr o p p o 1 ariscopeoculogyrogravo- 
adaptometer, so they call it a 
V-meter and everybody’s happy. 
If you want to distinguish be- 
tween the thrust of rapid ac- 
celeration from the rear and 
rapid acceleration from the 
front, it’s fair enough to term 
the first “eyeballs in” and the 
second “eyeballs out”. What 



does a panel of hull metal look 
like? Why, like an elephant’s 
ear — more or less — and so 
that is what it is called. And no f 
doubt a special name is needed 
for the kind of toothache caused 
by rapid changes in air pressure 
experienced by astronauts eject- 
ed from their capsules. If so, 
aerodontalgia is undoubtedly as 
good a name for it as any. 
(These aerospace terms we 
found in Martin Caidin’s Man- 
in-Space Dictionary .) 

T)ut it’s all going too far, if you 
ask us. The trouble is, we’re 
running out of words. 

Maybe Johnathan Swift had a 
good idea. His Laputans didn’t 
use words at all, but carried on 
their backs an assortment of all 
objects they might wish to dis- 
cuss. If they wanted to convey 
“apple”, they pointed to a real 
apple. Similarly there isn’t any 
need to invent a term like poly- 
fluxpicated cisducer” when you 
can just point to the widget in 
question and say, “You know, 
that thing there.” 

Of course, this might seriously 
cut down shop-talk away from 
the actual scene of work — a 
bevatron isn’t normally the kind 
of thing one carries to a faculty 
tea. 

But what’s wrong with that?

THE BOY 
WHO BOUGHT 
OLD EARTH 

Complete Short Novel 

by CORDWAINiR SMITH 

ILLUSTRATED BY MORROW 



The Old Norstrilians weren't exactly 
hostile to the rest of humanity — they 



just didn't want to 



PRELUDE 

L ater, much later, people for- 
got how Rod McBan had 
bought the whole Planet Earth 
without even knowing that he 



bother with theml 



had done it. They remembered 
the extraneous things, like the 
Council of Thieves chartering 
whole fleets to intercept Rod on 
his way between Old North Aus- 
tralia and Earth. They remem- 



bered the little ballad which had 
been made up for the Chief of 
Thieves at about that time: 

Arson lor the arsenal. 

Money In the money-bags 
Parson In the parsonage. 

And the girl for me! 

(They even explained that a 
parsonage was a vital statistics 
computer and the parson was 
its input screen.) 

The real drama remained un- 
told. 

What had driven a rich, my- 
sterious boy to gamble every- 
thing — perhaps even his life — 
from the richest planet in the 
galaxy in order to buy Earth? 
What could he have possibly 
done with Earth if he did get it? 

You have to understand some- 
thing of Old North Australia 
(familiarly called “Norstrilia”) 
to see how he did it. 

You have to understand why 
a lot of the young died young. 

Then you get the pitch of it 
and you have the real story, the 
inside story, the original history 
— not just a cartoon of a hand- 
some yellow-haired boy standing 
with his arms full of megacredit 
papers. 

• He never held them, anyhow. 
He couldn’t have held them. 
There were too many. This boy 
had bought Earth, Manhome it- 
self, the Earthport tower, the 
oceans, everything. You couldn’t 



get the paper titles of all that 
stuff into one person’s room, 
much less into his arms. 

So let’s go back to the begin- 
nings, and start with Old North 
Australia. 

I 

Ctory, place and time — these 
are the essentials. 

The story is simple. There was 
a boy who bought the planet 
Earth. We know that, to our 
cost. It only happened once, and 
we have taken pains that it will 
never happen again. He came to 
Earth, got what he wanted and 
got away alive, in a series of 
very remarkable adventures. 
That’s the story. 

The place? That’s Old North 
Australia. What other place 
could it be? Where else do the 
farmers pay ten million credits 
for a handkerchief, five million 
for a bottle of beer? Where else 
do people lead peaceful lives, 
untouched by militarism, on a 
world which is boobytrapped 
with death and things worse 
than death? Old North Austra- 
lia has stroon — the santaclara 
drug — and more than a thou- 
sand other planets clamor for it. 
But you can get stroon only 
from Norstrilia, because it is a 
virus which grows on enormous, 
gigantic, misshapen sheep. The 
sheep were taken from Earth to

THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



start a pastoral system; they 
ended up as the greatest of imag- 
inable treasures. The simple 
farmers became simple billion- 
aires, but they kept their farm- 
ing ways. They started tough 
and they got tougher. 

People get pretty mean if you 
rob them and hurt them for al- 
most three thousand years. They 
get obstinate. They avoid strang- 
ers, except for sending out spies 
and a very occasional tourist. 
They don’t mess with other peo- 
ple and they’re death, death in- 
side out and turned over twice, 
if you mess with them. 

Then one of their kids showed 
up on Earth and bought it. The 
whole place, lock, stock and un- 
derpeople. 

That was a real embarrass- 
ment for Earth. 

And for Norstrilia, too. 

If it had been the two govern- 
ments, Norstrilia would have 
collected all the eye-teeth on 
earth and sold them back at 
compound interest. That’s the 
way Norstrilians do business. Or 
they might have said, “Skip it, 
cobber. You can keep your wet 
old ball. We’ve got a nice dry 
world of our own.” That’s the 
"temper they have. Unpredict- 
able. 

But a kid had bought Earth, 
and it was his. 

Legally he had the right to 
pump up the Sunset Ocean, 



shoot it into space and sell wa- 
ter all over the inhabited galaxy. 

He didn’t. 

He wanted something else. 

The Earth authorities thought 
it was girls, so they tried to 
throw girls at him of all shapes, 
sizes, smells and ages — all the 
way from young ladies of good 
family down to undergirls who 
smelled of romance all the time, 
except for the first five minutes 
after they had had hot antisep- 
tic showers. But he didn’t want 
girls. He wanted postage stamps. 

That baffled both Earth and 
Norstrilia. The Norstrilians are 
a hard people from a harsh 
planet, and they think highly of 
property. (Why shouldn’t they? 
They have most of it.) A story 
like this could only have started 
in Norstrilia. 

hat’s Norstrilia 
Somebody once singsonged 
it up, like this: 

“Gray lay the land, oh. Gray 
grass from sky to sky. Not near 
the weir, dear. Not a mountain, 
low or high — only hills and 
gray gray. Watch the dappled 
dimpled twinkles blooming on 
the star bar. 

“That is Norstrilia. 

“All the muddy glubbery is 
gone — all the poverty, the wait- 
ing and the pain. People fought 
their way away from monstrous 
forms. People fought for hands

and noses, eyes and feet, man 
and woman. They got it all back 
again. Back they came from 
daylight nightmares, centuries 
when monstrous men, sucking 
the water around the pools, 
dreamed of being men again. 
They found it. Men they were 
again, again, far away from a 
horrid when. 

“The sheep, poor beasties, did 
not make it. Out of their sick- 
ness they distilled immortality 
for man. Who says research 
could do it? Research, be- 
smirch! It was a pure accident 
Smack up an accident, man, 
and you’ve got it made. 

“Beige-brown sheep lie on 
blue-gray grass while the clouds 
rush past, low overhead, like 
iron pipes ceilinging the world. 

“Take your pick of sick sheep, 
man, it’s the sick that pays. 
Sneeze me a planet, man, or 
cough me up a spot of life -for- 
ever. If it’s barmy there, where 
the noddies and trolls like you 
live, it’s too right here. 

“That’s the book, boy. 

“If you haven’t seen it, you 
haven’t seen Norstrilia. If you 
did see it, you wouldn’t believe 
it. If you got there, you wouldn’t 
get off alive. 

“Mother Hitton’s littul kittons 
wait for you down there. Little 
pets they are, little little little 
pets. Cute little things, they say. 
Don’t you believe it. No man 



ever saw them and walked away 
alive. You won’t either. That’s 
the final dash, flash. That’s the 
utter clobber, cobber. 

“Charts call the place Old 
North Australia.” 

We can suppose that that is 
what it is like in this time, the 
first century of the Rediscovery 
of Man. When C’mell lived. 
About the time they polished off 
Shayol, like wiping an apple on 
the sleeve. Long deep into our 
own time. Fifteen thousand years 
after the bombs went up and the 
boom came down on Old, Old 
Earth. 

Recent, see? 

hat happens in the story? 
Read it 

Who’s there? 

It starts with Rod McBan — 
who had the real name of Rod- 
erick Frederick Ronald Arnold 
William MacArthur McBan. But 
you can’t tell a story if you call 
the main person by a name as 
long as Roderick Frederick Ar- 
nold William MacArthur Mc- 
Ban. You have to do what his 
neighbors did — call him Rod 
McBan. The old ladies always 
said, “Rod McBan to the hun- 
dred and fifty -first . .” and then 
sighed. Flurp a squirt at them, 
friends. We don’t need numbers. 
We know his family was distin- 
guished. We know the poor kid 
was born to troubles. 




THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



11 



He was bom to inherit the 
Station of Doom. 

He almost failed the Garden 
of Death. 

The Onseck was after him. 

His father had died out in the 
dirty part of space, where peo- 
ple never find nice clean deaths. 

When he got in trouble, he 
trusted his computer. 

The computer gambled, and it 
won Earth. 

He went to Earth. 

That was history itself — that 
and C’mell beside him. 

At long, long last he got his 
rights and he came home. 

That’s the story. Except for 
the details. 

They follow. 

II 

D od McBan faced the day of 
days. He knew what it was 
all about, but he could not real- 
ly feel it. He wondered if they 
had tranquilized him with half- 
refined stroon, a product so rare 
and precious that it was never, 
never sold off-planet. 

He knew that by nightfall he 
would be laughing and giggling 
and drooling in one of the Dy- 
ing Rooms, where the unfit were 
put away to thin out the human 
breed, or else he would stand 
forth as the oldest landholder 
on the planet, Chief Heir to the 
Station of Doom. The farm had 



been salvaged by his great 32- 
grandfather, almost two thou- 
sand years ago, and it was called 
Doom when he first inherited 
it. But the great 32 -grandfather 
had bought an ice-asteroid, 
crashed it into the farm over the 
violent objections of his neigh- 
bors and learned clever tricks 
with artesian wells which kept 
his grass growing while the 
neighbors’ fields turned from 
gray-green to blowing dust. The 
McBans had kept the sarcastic 
old name for their farming sta- 
tion, the Station of. Doom. 

By night, Rod knew, the Sta- 
tion would be his. 

Or he would be dying, gig- 
gling his way to death in the 
killing place where people 
laughed and grinned and rol- 
licked about while they died. 

He found himself humming a 
bit of a rhyme that had always 
been a part of the tradition of 
Old North Australia : 

We kill to live, and die to grow — 
That’s the way the world must go! 

He’d been taught, bone deep, 
that his own world was a very 
special world, envied, loved, 
hated and dreaded across the 
galaxy. He knew that he was 
part of a very special people. 
Other races and kinds of men 
farmed crops, or raised food, or 
designed machines, and manu- 
factured weapons. Norstrilians 



12 



GALAXY 



did none of these things. From 
their dry fields, their sparse 
wells, their enormous sick sheep, 
they refined immortality itself. 

And sold it for a high, high 
price. 

Rod McBan walked a little 
way into the yard. His home lay 
behind him. It was a log cabin 
built out of Daimoni beams — 
beams uncuttable, unchangeable, 
solid beyond all expectations of 
solidity. They had been pur- 
chased as a matched set thirty- 
odd planet-hops away and 
brought to Old North Australia 
by photosails. The cabin was a 
fort which could withstand even 
major weapons, but it was still 
a cabin, simple inside and with 
a front yard of scuffed dust. 

The last red bit of dawn was 
whitening into day. 

Rod knew that he could not go 
far. 

He could hear the women out 
behind the house, the kinswom- 
en who had come to barber and 
groom him for the triumph — 
or the other. 

They never knew how much 
he knew. Because of his afflic- 
tion, they had thought around 
him for years, counting on his 
telepathic deafness to be con- 
stant. Trouble was, it wasn’t; 
lots of times he heard things. 

He even remembered the 
sad little poem they had about 
the young people who failed to 



pass the test for one reason or 
another and had to go to the 
Dying House instead of coming 
forth as Norstrilian citizens and 
fully recognized subjects of Her- 
majesty-the-queen. (Norstrilians 
had not had a real queen for 
some fifteen thousand years, but 
they were strong on tradition 
and did not let mere facts boggle 
them.) How did the little poem 
run, “This is the house of the 
long ago. .”? In its own gloomy 
way it was cheerful. 

TTe erased his own footprint 
A A from the dust and suddenly 
he remembered the whole thing. 
He chanted it softly to himself. 

This Is the house of the long ago. 
Where the old ones murmur an endless 
woe, 

Where the pain of time Is an actual pain 
And things once known always come 
again. 

Out In the garden of death, our young 
Have tasted the valiant taste of fear; 
With muscular arm and reckless tongue, 
They hav$ won and lost and escaped us 
here. 

This is the house of the long ago. 
Those who die young do not enter here. 
Those loving on know that hell is near. 
The old ones who suffer have willed It 
so. 

Out In the garden of death, the old 
Look with awe at the young and bold. 

It was all right to say that 
they looked with awe at the 
young and bold, but he hadn’t 
met a person yet who did not 
prefer life to death. He’d heard 
about people who chose death 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



13 



— of course he had — who 
hadn’t? But the experience was 
third-hand, fourth-hand, fifth- 
hand. 

He knew that some people 
had said of him that he would 
be better off dead, just because 
he had never learned to com- 
municate telepathically and had 
to use old spoken words like 
outworlders or barbarians. 

Rod himself certainly didn’t 
think he would be better dead. 

Indeed, he sometimes looked 
at normal people and wondered 
how they managed to go through 
life with the constant silly chat- 
ter of other people’s thoughts 
running through their minds. 
In the times that his mind lift- 
ed, so that he could “hier” for 
a while, he knew that hundreds 
or thousands of minds rattled in 
on him with unbearable clarity; 
he could even “hier” the minds 
that thought they had their tele- 
pathic shields up. Then, in a 
little while, the merciful cloud 
of his handicap came down on 
his mind again and he had a 
deep unique privacy which ev- 
erybody on Old North Australia 
should have envied. 

His computer had said to him 
once, “The words hier and spiek 
are corruptions of the words 
hear and s peak. They are always 
pronounced in the second rising 
tone of voice, as though you 
were asking a question under 



the pressure of amusement and 
alarm, if you say the words with 
your voice. They refer only to 
telepathic communication be- 
tween persons or between per- 
sons and underpeople.” 

“What are underpeople?” he 
had asked. 

“Animals modified to speak, 
to understand, and usually to 
look like men. They differ from 
cerebrocentered robots in that 
the robots are built around an 
actual animal mind, but are me- 
chanical and electronic relays, 
while underpeople are com- 
posed entirely of Earth-derived 
living tissue.” 

“Why haven’t I ever seen 
one?’ 

“They are not allowed on 
Norstrilia at all, unless they are 
in the service of the defense 
establishments of the Common- 
wealth.” 

“Why are we called a Com- 
monwealth, when all the other 
places are called worlds or 
planets?” 

“Because you people are sub- 
jects of the Queen of England.” 

“Who is the Queen of Eng- 
land?” 

“She was an Earth ruler in 
the Most Ancient Days, more 
than fifteen thousand years ago.” 

“Where is she now?” 

“I said,” said the computer, 
“that it was fifteen thousand 
years ago.” 



14 



GALAXY 



“I know it,” Rod had insisted, 
“but if there hasn’t been any 
Queen of England for fifteen 
thousand years, how can we be 
her subjects?” 

“I know the answer in human 
words,” the reply had come 
from the friendly red machine, 
“but since it makes no sense to 
me, I shall have to quote it to 
you as people told it to me. ‘She 
bloody well might turn up one 
of these days. Who knows? This 
is Old North Australia out here 
among the stars and we can 
dashed well wait for our own 
Queen. She might have been off 
on a trip when Old Old Earth 
went sour.’ ” The computer had 
clucked a few times in its odd 
ancient voice and had then said 
hopefully, in its toneless voice, 
“Could you re-state that so that 
I could program it as part of 
my memory-assembly?” 

“It doesn’t mean much to me. 
Next time I can hier other 
minds thinking I’ll try to pick 
it out of somebody else’s head.” 

r I 'hat had been about a year 
ago, and Rod had never run 
across the answer. 

Last night he had asked the 
computer more urgently. 

“Will I die tomorrow?” 
“Question irrelevant. No an- 
swer available.” 

“Computer!” he had shouted, 
“you know I love you.” 



“You say so.” 

“I started your historical as- 
sembly up after repairing you 
when that part had been think- 
less for hundreds of years.” 
“Correct.” 

“I crawled down into this cave 
and found the personal controls 
where great 14 - grandfather had 
left them when they became ob- 
solete.” 

“Correct” 

“I’m going to die tomorrow 
and you won’t even be sorry.” 
“I did not say that,” said the 
computer. 

“Don’t you care?” 

“I was not programmed to 
care. Since you yourself repair- 
ed me, Rod, you ought to know 
that I am the only all -mechani- 
cal computer functioning in this 
part of the galaxy. I am sure 
that if I had emotions I would 
be very sorry indeed. It is an 
extreme probability, since you 
are my only companion. But I 
do not have emotions. I have 
numbers, facts, language and 
memory — that is all.” 

“What is the probability, 
then, that I will die tomorrow 
in the Giggle Room?” 

“That is not the right name. 
It is the Dying House.” 

“All right, then, the Dying 
House.” 

“The judgment on you will be 
a contemporary human judg- 
ment based upon emotions. Since

I do not know the individuals 
concerned, I cannot make a pre- 
diction of any value at all.” 

“What do you think is going 
to happen to me, computer?” 

“I do not really think. I re- 
spond. I have no input on that 
topic.” 

“Do you know anything at all 
about my life and death tomor- 
row? I know I can’t spiek with 
my mind, but have to make 
sounds with my mouth instead. 
Why should they kill me for 
that?” 

“I do not know the people 
concerned and therefore I do 
not know the reasons,” the com- 
puter had replied, “but I know 
the history of Old North Aus- 
tralia down to your great 14 - 
grandfather’s time.” 

“Tell me that, then,” Rod had 
said. He had squatted in the 
cave which he had discovered, 
listening to the forgotten set of 
computer controls which he had 
repaired, and had heard again 
the story of Old North Australia 
as his great 14 - grandfather had 
understood it. Stripped of per- 
sonal names and actual dates, it 
was a simple story. 

This morning his life hung on 
it 

Norstrilia had to thin out its 
people if it were going to keep 
its Old Old Earth character and 
be another Australia, out among 
the stars. Otherwise the fields 



would fill up, the deserts turn 
into apartment houses, the sheep 
die in cellars under endless ken- 
nels for crowded and useless 
people. No Old North Austra- 
lian wanted that to happen, 
when he could keep character, 
immortality and wealth — in 
that particular order of impor- 
tance. It would be contrary to 
the character of Norstrilia. 

The simple character of Nors- 
trilia was immutable — as im- 
mutable as anything out among 
the stars. This ancient Common- 
wealth was the only human in- 
stitution older than the Instru- 
mentality. 

Ill 

r T''he story was simple, the way 
the computer’s clear long-cir- 
cuited brain had sorted it out. 

Take a farmer culture straight 
off Old Old Earth — Manhome 
itself. 

Put the culture on a remote 
planet. 

Touch it with prosperity and 
blight it with drought. 

Teach it sickness, deformity, 
hardihood. Make it learn pov- 
erty so bad that men sold one 
child to buy another child the 
drink of water which would give 
it an extra day of life while the 
drills whirred deep into the dry 
rock, looking for wetness. 

Teach that culture thrift, med- 



16 



GALAXY 



kane, scholarship, pain, sur- 
vival. 

Give those people the lessons 
of poverty, war, grief, greed, 
magnanimity, piety, hope and 
despair by turn. 

Let the culture survive — sur- 
vive disease, deformity, despair, 
desolation, abandonment. 
w Then give it the happiest ac- 
cident in the history of time. 

Out of sheep-sickness came in- 
finite riches, the santaclara drug 
or “stroon” which prolonged hu- 
man life indefinitely. Prolonged 
it — but with queer side-effects, 
so that most Norstrilians pre- 
ferred to die in a thousand years 
or so. 

Norstrilia was cor -ulsed by 
the discovery. So was every oth- 
er inhabited world. But the drug 
could not be synthesized, paral- 
leled, duplicated. It was some- 
thing which could be obtained 
only from the sick sheep on the 
Old North Australian plains. 

Robbers and governments 
tried to steal the drug. Now and 
then they succeeded, long ago, 
but they hadn’t made it since 
the time of Rod’s great 19 - 
grandfather. 

They had tried to steal the 
sheep. 

Several had been taken off the 
planet. The Fourth Battle of 
New Alice, in which half the 
menfolk of Norstrilia had died 
beating off the Bright Empire, 



had led to the abduction of two 
of the sick sheep — one female 
and one male. The Bright Em- 
pire thought it had won. It 
hadn’t. The sheep got well, pro- 
duced healthy lambs, exuded no 
more stroon and died. The 
Bright Empire had paid . four 
battle fleets for a coldbox full 
of mutton, and the monopoly 
remained in Norstrilia. 

The Norstrilians exported the 
santaclara drug, and they put 
the export on a systematic basis. 

They achieved almost infinite 
riches. 

The poorest man on Norstrilia 
was always richer than the rich- 
est man anywhere else, emper- 
ors and conquerors included. 
Every farm-hand earned at least 
a hundred Earth megacredits a 
day — measured in real money 
on Old Earth, not in paper which 
had to travel at steep arbitrage. 

But the Norstrilians made 
their choice: the choice — 

To remain themselves. 

They taxed themselves back 
into simplicity. 

Luxury goods got a tax of 20,- 
000,000%. For the price of fifty 
palaces on Olympia, you could 
import a handkerchief into Nor- 
strilia. A pair of shoes, landed, 
cost the price of a hundred 
yachts in orbit. All machines 
were prohibited, except for 
defense and the drug-gathering. 
Underpeople were never made 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



17 



on Norstrilia, and imported only 
by the defense authority for 
top secret reasons. Old North 
Australia remained simple, pion- 
eer, fierce, open. 

Many families emigrated to 
enjoy their wealth; they could 
not return. 

But the population problem 
remained, even with the taxation 
and simplicity and hard work. 

Cut back, then — cut back 
people if you must. 

But how, whom, where? Birth 
control — beastly. Sterilization 
— inhuman, unmanly, un-Brit- 
ish. (This last was an ancient 
word meaning “very bad in- 
deed.”) 

By families, then. Let the 
families have the children. Let 
the Commonwealth test them at 
sixteen. If they ran under the 
standards, send them to a happy, 
happy death. 

T)ut what about the families? 

You can’t wipe a family out, 
not in a conservative farmer so- 
ciety, when the neighbors are 
folk who have fought and died 
beside you for a hundred gen- 
erations. The Rule of Exceptions 
came. Any family which reach- 
ed the end of its line could have 
the last surviving heir re-pro- 
cessed — up to four times. If he 
failed, it was the Dying House 
for the boy, and a designated 
adopted heir from another fam- 



ily took over the name and the 
estate. 

Otherwise their survivors 
would have gone on, in this cen- 
tury a dozen, in that century 
twenty. Soon Norstrilia would 
have been divided into two 
classes, the sound ones and a 
privileged class of hereditary 
freaks. This they could not 
stand, not while the space 
around them stank of danger, 
not when men a hundred worlds 
away dreamed and died while 
thinking of how to steal the 
stroon. They had to be fighters, 
and they chose not to be soldiers 
or emperors. Therefore they had 
to be fit, alert, healthy, clever, 
simple and moral. They had to 
be better than any possible en- 
emy or any possible combina- 
tion of enemies. 

They made it. 

Old North Australia became 
the toughest, brightest, simplest 
world in the galaxy. One by one, 
without weapons, Norstrilians 
could tour the other worlds and 
kill almost anything which at- 
tacked them. Governments fear- 
ed them. Ordinary people hated 
them or worshipped them. Off- 
world men eyed their women 
queerly. The Instrumentality left 
them alone, or defended them 
without letting them know. 
(As in the case of Raumsog, 
who brought his whole world to 
a death of cancer and volcanoes,

because the Golden Ship struck 
once.) 

Norstrilian mothers learned to 
stand by with dry eyes when 
their children, unexpectedly 
drugged if they failed the tests, 
drooled with pleasure and went 
giggling away to their deaths. 

The space and sub-space 
around Norstrilia became sticky 
and sparky with the multiplicity 
of their defenses. Big outdoorsy 
men sailed tiny fighting craft 
around the approaches to Old 
North Australia. When people 
met them in outports, they al- 
ways thought that Norstrilians 
looked simple, but the looks 
were a snare and a delusion. 
The Norstrilians had been con- 
ditioned by thousands of years 
of unprovoked attack. They 
looked as simple as sheep, but 
their minds were as subtle as 
serpents. 

And now — Rod McBan. 

The last heir, the very last 
heir, of their proudest old fam- 
ily had been found a half-freak. 
He was normal enough by Earth 
standards, but by Norstrilian 
measure he was inadequate. He 
was a bad, bad telepath. He 
could not be counted on to hier. 
Most of the time other people 
could not transmit into his mind 
at all; they could not even read 
it. All they got was a fiery bub- 
ble and a dull fuzz of meaning- 
less sub-sememes, fractions of 



thought which added up to less 
than nothing. And on spieking, 
he was worse. He could not talk 
with his mind at all. 

Now and then he transmitted, 
and when he did the neighbors 
ran for cover. If it was anger, a 
bloody screaming roar almost 
blotted out their consciousnesses 
with a rage as solid and red as 
meat hanging in a slaughter- 
house. If he was happy, it was 
worse. His happiness, which he 
transmitted without knowing it, 
had the distractiveness of a 
speed-saw cutting into diamond- 
grained rock. His happiness 
drilled into people with an ini- 
tial sense of pleasure, followed 
rapidly by acute discomfort and 
the sudden wish that all their 
own teeth would fall out, for the 
teeth had turned into spinning 
whorls of raw, unqualified dis- 
comfort. 

They did not know his biggest 
personal secret. They suspected 
that he could hier now and then 
without being able to control it. 
They did not know that when 
he did hier, he could hier every- 
thing for miles around with 
microscopic detail and telescop- 
ic range. His telepathic intake, 
when it did work, went right 
through other people’s mind- 
shields as though they did not 
exist. (If some of the women in 
the farms around the Station of 
Doom knew what he had acci- 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



19 



dentally peeped out of their 
minds, they would have blushed 
the rest of their lives.) As a re- 
sult, Rod McBan had a frightful 
amount of unsorted knowledge 
which did not quite fit together. 

Previous committees had nei- 
ther awarded him the Station of 
Doom nor sent him off to the 
giggle death. They had appreci- 
ated his intelligence, his quick 
wit, his enormous physical 
strength. But they remained 
worried about his telepathic 
handicap. Three times before he 
had been judged. Three times. 

And three times judgment 
had been suspended. 

They had chosen the lesser 
cruelty and had sent him not to 
death, but to a new babyhood 
and a fresh upbringing, hoping 
that the telepathic capacity of 
his mind would naturally soar 
up to the Norstrilian normal. 

They had underestimated 
him. 

He knew it. 

Thanks to the eavesdropping 
which he could not control, he 
understood bits and pieces of 
what was happening even though 
nobody had ever told him the 
rational whys and hows of the 
process. 

I t was a gloomy but composed 
big boy who gave the dust of 
his own front yard one last use- 
less kick, who turned back into 



the cabin, walking right through 
to the main room to the rear 
door and the back yard, and 
who greeted his kinswomen po- 
litely enough as they, hiding 
their aching hearts, prepared to 
dress him up for his trial. They 
did not want the child to be up- 
set, even though he was as big 
as a man and showed more com- 
posure than did most adult men. 
They wanted to hide the fearful 
truth from him. How could they 
help it? 

He already knew; but he pre- 
tended he didn’t. Cordially 
enough, just scared enough but 
not too much, he said: 

“What ho, auntie! Hello, cous- 
in. Morning, Maribel. Here’s 
your sheep. Curry him up and 
trim him for the livestock com- 
petition. Do I get a ring in my 
nose or a bow ribbon around my 
neck?” 

One or two of the young ones 
laughed, but his oldest “aunt” — 
actually a fourth cousin, married 
into another family — pointed 
seriously and calmly at a chair 
in the yard and said, “Do sit 
down, Roderick. This is a seri- 
ous occasion and we usually do 
not talk while preparations are 
going on.” 

She bit her lower lip and then 
she added, not as though she 
wanted to frighten him but be- 
cause she wanted to impress 
him: 



20 



GALAXY 



“The Vice-chairman will be 
here today.” 

(“The Vice-chairman” was the 
head of the government; there 
had been no Chairman of the 
Temporary Commonwealth 
Government for some thousands 
of years. Norstilians did not 
like posh and they thought that 
“vice-chairman” was high 
enough for any one man to go. 
Besides, it kept the offworlders 
guessing.) 

Rod was not impressed. He 
had seen the man. It was in one 
of his rare moments of broad 
hiering and he found that the 
mind of the vice-chairman was 
full of numbers and horses, the 
results of every horse-race for 
three hundred and twenty years, 
and the projection forward of 
six probable horse races in the 
next two years. 

“Yes, auntie,” he said. 

“Don’t bray all the time to- 
day. You don’t have to use your 
voice for little things like say- 
ing yes. Just nod your head. It 
will make a much better impres- 
sion.” 

He started to answer, but 
gulped and nodded instead. 

She sank the comb into his 
thick yellow hair. 

Another one of the women, 
almost a girl, brought up a small 
table and a basin. He could tell 
from her expression that she 
was spieking to him, but this was 



one of die times in which he 
could not hier at all. 

The aunt gave his hair a 
particularly fierce tug just as 
the girl took his hand. He did 
not know what she meant to do. 
He yanked his hand back. 

The basin fell off the small 
table. Only then did he realize 
that it was merely soapy water 
for a manicure. 

“I am sorry,” he said; even to 
him, his voice sounded like a 
bray. For a moment he felt the 
fierce rush of humiliation and 
self-hate. 

They should kill me, he 
thought. By the time the sun 
goes down Fll be in the Giggle 
Room, laughing and laughing be- 
fore the medicine makes my 
brains boil away. 

He had reproached himself. 

The two women had said 
nothing. The aunt had walked 
away to get some shampoo, and 
the girl was returning with a 
pitcher, to re-fill the basin. 

He looked directly into her 
eyes, and she into his. 

“I want you,” she said, very 
clearly, very quietly, and with 
a smile which seemed inexpli- 
cable to him. 

“What for?” said he, equally 
quietly. 

“Just you,” she said. “I want 
you for myself. You’re going to 
lfve.” 

“You’re Lavinia, my cousin,” 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



21 



said he, as though discovering 
it for the first time. 

“Sh-h-h,” said the girl. “She’s 
coming back.” 

TT’hen the girl had settled 
’ ’down to getting his finger- 
nails really clean, and the aunt 
had rubbed something like 
sheep-dip into his hair, Rod be- 
gan to feel happy. 

His mood changed from the 
indifference which he had been 
pretending to himself. It became 
a real indifference to his fate, 
an easy acceptance of the gray 
sky above him, the dull rolling 
earth below. He had a fear — a 
little tiny fear, so small that it 
might have seemed to be a mid- 
get pet in a miniature cage — 
running around the inside of his 
thinking. It was not the fear 
that he would die. Somehow he 
suddenly accepted his chances 
and remembered how many oth- 
er people had had to take the 
same play with fortune. This 
little fear was something else, 
the dread that he might not be- 
have himself properly if they 
did tell him to die. 

But then, he thought, I don’t 
have to worry. A negative deci- 
sion is never a word — just a 
hypodermic, so that the first bad 
news the victim has is his own 
excited, happy laugh. 

With this funny peace of 
mind, his hiering suddenly lifted. 

22 



He could not see the Garden 
of Death, but he could look in- 
to the minds tending it; it was 
a huge van hidden just beyond 
the next roll of hills, where they 
used to keep Old Billy, the 1,800- 
ton sheep. He could hear the 
clatter of voices in the little 
town eighteen kilometers away. 
And he could look right into 
Lavinia’s mind. 

It was a picture of himself. 
But what a picture! So grown, 
so handsome, so brave-looking. 
He had schooled himself not to 
move when he could hier, so that 
other people would not realize 
that his rare telepathic gift had 
come back to him. 

Auntie was spieking to Lavi- 
nia without noisy words, “We’ll 
see this pretty boy in his coffin 
tonight.” 

Lavinia thought right back, 
without apology, “No, we won’t.” 

Rod sat impassive in his 
chair. The two women, their 
faces grave and silent, went on 
spieking the argument at each 
other with their minds. 

“How would you know?” 
spieked auntie. 

“He has the oldest station in 
all of Old North Australia. He 
has one of the very oldest names. 
He is — ” and even in spieking 
her thoughts cluttered up, like 
a stammer — “he is very 
nice. He’s going to be a won- 
derful man.” 



GALAXY 



“Mark my thought,” spieked 
the auntie again, “I’m telling 
you that we’ll see him in his 
coffin tonight and that by mid- 
night he’ll be in his coffin-ride 
to the Long Way Out.” 

Lavinia jumped to her feet. 
She almost knocked over the 
basin of water a second time. 
She moved her throat and 
mouth to speak words but she 
just croaked: 

“Sorry, Rod. Sorry.” 

Rod McBan, his face guarded, 
gave a pleasant, stupid little nod, 
as though he had no idea of 
what they had been spieking. 

She turned and ran, shout- 
spieking the loud thought at 
auntie, “Get somebody else to do 
his hands! You’re heartless, 
hopeless. Get somebody else to 
do your corpse-washing for you. 
Not me. Not me!” 

CtVX7Tiat’s the matter with 
her?” said Rod to the 
auntie, just as though he did not 
know. 

“She’s just difficult, that’s all. 
Nerves, I suppose,” she added in 
her croaking spoken words. She 
could not talk very well, since 
all her family and friends could 
spiek and hier with privacy and 
grace. “We were spieking with 
each other about what you 
would be doing tomorrow.” 
“Where’s a priest, auntie?” 
said Rod. 



“A what?” 

“A priest, like the old poem 
has, in the rough rough days be- 
fore our people found this plan- 
et and got our sheep settled 
down. Everybody knows it. 

Here Is the place where the priest 
went mad. 

Over there my mother burned. 

I cannot show you the house we had. 

We lost that slope when the moun- 
tain burned. 

There’s more to it, but that’s the 
part I remember. Isn’t a priest 
a specialist in how to die? Do 
we have any around here?” 

He watched her mind as she 
lied to him. As he had spoken 
he had a perfectly clear picture 
of one of their more distant 
neighbors, a man named Tolli- 
ver, who had a very gentle man- 
ner; but her words were not 
about Tolliver at all. 

“Some things are men’s busi- 
ness,” she said, cawing her 
words. “Anyhow, that song isn’t 
about Norstrilia at all. It’s about 
Paradise VII and why we left 
it. I didn’t know you knew it.” 

In her mind he read, “That 
boy knows too much.” 

“Thanks, auntie,” said he 
meekly. 

“Come along for the rinse,” 
said she. “We’re using an awful 
lot of real water on you today.” 

He followed her and he felt 
more kindly toward her when 
he saw her think, Lavinia had 
the right feelings but she drew 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



23 




the wrong conclusion. He’s go- 
ing to be dead tonight. 

That was too much. 

Rod hesitated for a moment, 
tempering the chords of his odd- 
ly-attuned mind. Then he let out 
a tremendous howl of telepathic 
joy, just to bother the lot of 
them. 

It did. They all stopped still. 
Then they stared at him. 

In words the auntie said, 
“What was that?” 

“What?” said he, innocently. 

“That noise you spieked. It 
wasn’t meaning.” 

“Just sort of a sneeze, I sup- 
pose. I didn’t know I did it.” 
Deep down inside himself he 
chuckled. He might be on his 



way to the Hoohoo Garden, but 
he would fritter their friskies 
for them while he did it. 

It was a dashed silly way to 
die, he thought all to himself. 

And then a strange, crazy, 
happy idea came to him: 

Perhaps they can’t kill me. 
Perhaps I have powers — pow- 
ers of my own! 

Well, we’ll soon enough find 
out.

door once as he had been in- 
structed to do, had a green light 
flash in his face, opened the 
door and entered. 

It was a garden. 

The moist, sweet, scent-laden 
air was like a narcotic. There 
were bright green plants in pro- 
fusion. The lights were clear but 
not bright; their ceiling gave 
the effect of a penetrating blue 
sky. He looked around. It was a 
copy of Old Old Earth. The 
growths on the green plants 
were rose s; he remembered pic- 
tures which his computer had 
showed him. The pictures had 
not gotten across the idea that 
they smelled nice at the same 
time that they looked nice. He 



wondered if they did that all the 
time, and then remembered the 
wet air: wet air always holds 
smells better than dry air does. 
At last, almost shyly, he looked 
up at the three judges. 

With real startlement, he saw 
that one of them was not a 
Norstrilian at all, but the local 
commissioner of the Instrumen- 
tality, the Lord Redlady — a 
thin man with a sharp, inquir- 
ing face. The other two were 
Old Taggart and John Beasley. 
He knew them, but not well. 

“Welcome,” said the Lord 
Redlady, speaking in the funny 
singsong of a man from Man- 
home. 

“Thank you,” said Rod. 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



25 




“You are Roderick Frederick 
Ronald Arnold William Mac- 
Arthur McBan the one hundred 
and fifty-first?” said Taggart, 
knowing perfectly well that Rod 
was that person. 

Lord love-a-duck and lucky- 
me! thought Rod, I’ve got my 
hiering, even in this place! 

“Yes,” said the Lord Redlady. 

There was silence. 

The other two judges looked 
at the manhome man; the 
stranger looked at Rod; Rod 
stared, and then began to feel 
sick at the bottom of his stom- 
ach. 

For the first time in his life, 
he had met somebody who could 
penetrate his peculiar percep- 
tual abilities. 

At last he thought, “I under- 
stand.” 

The Lord Redlady looked 
sharply and impatiently at him, 
as though waiting for a response 
to that single word “yes,” but 
Rod had already answered — 
telepathically. 

At last Old Taggart broke the 
silence. “Aren’t you going to 
talk? I asked you your name.” 

The Lord Redlady held up his 
hand in a gesture for patience; 
it was not a gesture which Rod 
had ever seen before, but he un- 
derstood it immediately. 

He thought telepathically at 
Rod, “You are watching my 
thoughts.” 



“Indeed I am,” thought Rod, 
back at him. 

The Lord Redlady clapped a 
hand to his forehead. “You are 
hurting me. Did you think you 
said something?” 

With his voice Rod said, "I 
told you that I was reading your 
mind.” 

r T''he Lord Redlady turned to 
the other two men and 
spieked to then: “Did either of 
you hier what he tried to spiek?” 
“No.” “No.” They both 

thought back at him. “Just noise, 
loud noise.” 

“He is a broadbander like my- 
self. And I have been disgraced 
for it. You know that I am the 
only Lord of the Instrumental- 
ity who has been degraded from 
the status of Lord to that of 
Commissioner — ” 

“Yes,” they spieked. 

“You know that they could 
not cure me of shouting and 
suggested I die?” 

“No,” they answered. 

“You know that the Instru- 
mentality thought I could not 
bother you here and sent me to 
your planet on this miserable, 
job, just to get me out of the 
way?” 

‘Yes,” they answered. 

“Then, what do you want to 
do about him? Don’t try to fool 
him. He knows all about this 
place already.” The Lord Red-

lady glanced quickly, sympathe- 
tically up at Rod, giving him a 
little phantom smile of encour- 
agement. “Do you want to kill 
him? To exile him? To turn 
him loose?” 

The other two men fussed 
around in their minds. Rod 
could see that they were trou- 
bled at the idea he could watch 
them thinking, when they had 
thought him a telepathic deaf- 
mute; they also resisted the 
Lord Redlady’s unmannerly 
precipitation of the decision. 
Rod almost felt that he was 
swimming in the thick wet air, 
with the smell of roses cloying 
his nostrils so much that he 
would never smell anything but 
roses again, when he became 
aware of a massive conscious- 
ness very near him — a fifth 
person in the room, whom he 
had not noticed at all before. 

It was an earth soldier, com- 
plete with uniform. The soldier 
was handsome, erect, tall, for- 
mal with a rigid military de- 
corum. He was, furthermore, not 
human and he had a strange 
weapon in his left hand. 

“What is that?” spieked Rod 
to the Earthman. The man saw 
his face, not the thought. 

“An underman. A snakeman. 
The only one on this planet. He 
will carry you out of here if the 
decision goes against you.” 

Beasley cut in, almost angrily. 



“Here, cut it out. This is a hear- 
ing, not a blossoming tea-party. 
Don’t clutter all that futt into 
the air. Keep it formal.” 

“You want a formal hearing?” 
said the Lord Redlady. “A for- 
mal hearing for a man who 
knows everything that all of us 
are thinking? It’s foolish.” 

“In Old North Australia, we 
always have formal hearings,” 
said Old Taggart. With an acute- 
ness of insight born of his own 
personal danger, Rod saw Tag- 
gart all over again for the first 
time — a careworn poor old 
man, who had worked a poor 
farm hard for a thousand years; 
a farmer, like his ancestors be- 
fore him ; a man rich only in 
the millions of megacredits 
which he would never take time 
to spend; a man of the soil, hon- 
orable, careful, formal, righteous 
and very just. Such men did not 
yield to innovation, ever. 

“Have the hearing then,” said 
the Lord Redlady, “have the 
hearing if it is your custom, my 
mister and owner Taggart, my 
mister and owner Beasley.” 

The Norstrilians, appeased, 
bowed their heads briefly. 

Almost shyly, Beasley looked 
over at the Lord Redlady. “Sir 
and Commissioner, will you say 
the words — the good old words 
that will help us to find our 
duty and to do it.” 

(Rod saw a quick flare of red

anger go through the Lord Red- 
lady’s mind as the Earth com- 
missioner thought fiercely to 
himself, “Why all this fuss about 
killing one poor boy? Let him 
go, you dull clutts, or kill him.” 
But the Earthman had not di- 
rected the thoughts outward and 
the two Norstrilians were un- 
aware of his private view of 
them.) 

/^\n the outside, the Lord Red- 
lady remained calm. He 
used his voice, as Nostrilians did 
on occasion of great ceremony: 
“We are here to hear a man.” 
“We are here to hear him,” 
they responded. 

“We are not to judge or to 
kill, though this may follow,” 
said he. 

“Though this may follow,” 
they responded. 

“And where, on Old Old 
Earth, does man come from?” 
They knew the answer by rote 
and said it heavily together: 
“This is the way it was on Old 
Old Earth, and this the way it 
shall be among the stars, no 
matter how far we men may 
wander: 

“The seed of wheat is planted 
in dark, moist earth; the seed of 
man in dark, moist flesh. The 
seed of wheat fights upward to 
air, sun and space; the stalk, 
leaves, blossom and grain flour- 
ish under the open glare of 



heaven. The seed of man grows 
in the salty private ocean of the 
womb, the sea-darkness remem- 
bered by the bodies of his race. 
The harvest of wheat is collect- 
ed by the hands of men; the 
harvest of men is collected by 
the tenderness of eternity.” 

“And what does this mean?” 
chanted the Lord Redlady. 

“To look with mercy, to de- 
cide with mercy, to kill with 
mercy, but to make the harvest 
of man strong and true and 
good, the way that the harvest 
of wheat stood high and proud 
on Old Old Earth.” 

“And who is here?” he asked. 

They both recited Rod’s full 
name. 

When they had finished, the 
Lord Redlady turned to Rod and 
said, “I am about to utter the 
ceremonial words, but I promise 
you that you will not be sur- 
prised, no matter what happens. 
Take it easy, therefore; easy, 
easy.” Rod was watching the 
Earthman’s mind and the mind 
of the two Norstrilians. He 
could see that Beasley and Tag- 
gart were befuddled with the 
ritual of the words, the wetness 
and scent of the air and the false 
blue sky in the top of the van; 
they did not know what they 
were going to do. But Rod could 
also see a sharp, keen trium- 
phant thought forming in the 
bottom of the Lord Redlady’s 



28

mind, I'll get this boy off ! He 
almost smiled, despite the pres- 
ence of the snake man with the 
rigid smile and the immovable 
glaring eyes standing just three 
paces beside him and a little to 
his rear, so that Rod could only 
look at him through the corner 
of his eye. 

“Misters and owners!” said 
the Lord Redlady. 

“Mister chairman!” they an- 
swered. 

“Shall I inform the man who 
is being heard?” 

“Inform him!” they chanted. 

“Roderick Frederick Ronald 
Arnold William MacArthur Mc- 
Ban the one hundred and fifty- 
first!” 

“Yes, sir,” said Rod. 

“Heir-in-trust of the Station of 
Doom!” 

“That’s me,” said Rod. 

“Hear me!” said the Lord 
Redlady. 

“Hear him!” said the other 
two. 

“You have not come here, 
child and citizen Roderick, for 
us to judge you or to punish you. 
If these things are to be done, 
they must be done in another 
place or time, and they must be 
done by men other than our- 
selves. The only concern before 
this board is the following: 
should you or should you not 
be allowed to leave this room 
safe and free and well, taking 



into no account your innocence 
or guilt of matters which might 
be decided elsewhere, but hav- 
ing regard only for the survival 
and the safety and the welfare 
on this given planet? We are 
not punishing and we are not 
judging, but we are deciding, 
and what we are deciding is your 
life. Do you understand? Do you 
agree?” 

Rod nodded mutely, drinking 
in the wet rose-scented air and 
stilling his sudden dry thirst 
with the dampness of the atmos- 
phere. If things went wrong 
now, they did not have very far 
to go. Not with the motionless 
snake-man standing just beyond 
his reach. He tried to look at the 
snake-brain but got nothing out 
of it — except for an unexpect- 
ed glitter of recognition and de- 
fiance. 

nphe Lord Redlady went on, 
Taggart and Beasley hang- 
ing on his words as though they 
had never heard them before. 

“Child and citizen, you know 
the rules. We are not to find 
you wrong or right. No crime 
is judged here, no offense. Nei- 
ther is innocence. We are only 
judging the single question. 
Should you live or should you 
not? Do you understand? Do 
you agree?” 

Said Rod, “Yes, sir.” 

“And how stand you?” 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



29 



“What do you mean?” 

“This board is asking you 
your opinion. Should you live 
or should you not?” 

“I’d like to,” said Rod, “but 
I’m tired of all these child- 
hoods.” 

“That is not what the board 
is asking you, child and citizen,” 
said the Lord Redlady. “We are 
asking you, what do you think? 
Should you live or should you 
not live?” 

“You want me to judge my- 
self?” 

“That’s it, boy,” said Beasley, 
“you know the rules. Tell them, 
boy. I said we could count on 
you.” 

The sharp, friendly, neighbor- 
ly face unexpectedly took on 
great importance for Rod. He 
looked at Beasley as though he 
had never seen the man before. 
This man was trying to judge 
him, Rod; and he, Rod, had to 
help decide on what was to be 
done with himself. The medi- 
cine from the snake-man and 
the giggle-giggle death, or a walk 
out into freedom. Rod started to 
speak and checked himself ; he 
was to speak for Old North Aus- 
tralia. Old North Australia was 
a tough world, proud of its 
tough men. No wonder the 
board gave him a tough decision. 
Rod made up his mind and he 
spoke clearly and deliberately: 

"I’d say no. Do not let me live. 



I don’t fit. I can’t spiek and hier. 
Nobody knows what my chil- 
dren would be like, but the odds 
are against them. Except for one 
thing. 

“And what, child and citizen, 
is that?” asked the Lord Red- 
lady, while Beasley and Taggart 
watched as though they were 
staring at the last five meters of 
a horse race. 

“Look at me carefully, citizens 
and members of the board,” 
said Rod, finding that in this 
milieu it was easy to fall into 
a ceremonious way of talking. 
“Look at me carefully and do 
not consider my own happiness, 
because you are not allowed, by 
law, to judge that anyhow. Look 
at my talent — the way I can 
hier, the big thunderstorm way 
I can spiek.” Rod gathered his 
mind for a final gamble and as 
his lips got through talking, he 
spat his whole mind at them : 

— anger-anger, rage-red! 

— blood-red! 

— fire-fury ! 

— noise, stench, glare, rough- 
ness, sourness and hate hate 
hate! 

— all the anxiety of a bitter 
day! 

— crutts, whelps, pups ! 

It all poured out at once. The 
Lord Redlady turned pale and 
compressed his lips, Old Tag- 
gart put his hands over his face, 
Beasley looked bewildered and 



30 



GALAXY 



nauseated. Beasley then started 
to belch as calm descended on 
the room. 

In a slightly shaky voice, the 
Lord Redlady asked, “And what 
was that supposed to show, child 
and citizen?” 

“In grown-up form, sir, could 
it be a useful weapon?” 

The Lord Redlady looked at 
the other two. They talked with 
the tiny expressions on their 
faces; if they were spieking, 
Rod could not read it. This last 
effort had cost him all telepathic 
input. 

“Let’s go on,” said Taggart. 

“Are you ready?” said the 
Lord Redlady to Rod. 

“Yes, sir,” said Rod. 

“I continue,” said the Lord 
Redlady. “If you understand 
your own case as we see it, we 
shall proceed to make a deci- 
sion and, upon making the deci- 
sion, to kill you immediately or 
to set you free no less immedi- 
ately. And we appreciate the 
courtesy which you will have 
shown this board, for without 
courtesy there could be no prop- 
er hearing, without the hearing 
no appropriate decision, and 
without an appropriate decision 
there could be neither justice 
nor safety in the years to come. 
Do you understand? Do you 
agree?" 

“I suppose so,” said Rod. 

“Do you really understand? 



It is your life which we are talk- 
ing about,” said the Lord Red- 
lady. 

“I understand and I agree," 
said Rod. 

“Cover us,” said the Lord 
Redlady. 

Rod started to ask how when 
he understood that the com- 
mand was not directed at him 
in the least. 

The snake-man had come to 
life and was breathing heavily. 
He spoke in clear old words, 
with an odd dropping cadence 
in each syllable. 

“High, my lord, or utter max- 
imum?” 

TT'or answer, the Lord Redlady 
pointed his right arm straight 
up with the index finger straight 
at the ceiling. The snake-man 
hissed and gathered his emo- 
tions for an attack. 

Rod felt his skin go goose- 
pimply all over, then he felt the 
hair on the back of his neck rise, 
finally he felt nothing but an 
unbearable alertness. If these 
were the thoughts which the 
snake-man was sending out of 
the trailer van, no passer-by 
could possibly eavesdrop on the 
decision. The startling pressure 
of raw menace would take care 
of that instead. 

The three members of the 
board held hands and seemed to 
be asleep. 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



31 



The Lord Redlady opened his 
eyes and shook his head, almost 
imperceptibly, at the snake-sol- 
dier. 

The feeling of snake-threat 
went off. The soldier returned 
to his immobile position, eyes 
forward. The members of the 
board slumped over their table. 
They did not seem to be able 
or ready to speak. They looked 
out of breath. At last Taggart 
dragged himself to his feet, gasp- 
ing his message to Rod: 

“There’s the door, boy. Go. 
You’re a citizen. Free.” 

Rod started to thank him but 
the old man held up his right 
hand: 

“Don’t thank me. Duty. But 
remember — not one word, ever, 
about this hearing. Go along.” 

Rod plunged for the door, 
lurched through, and was in his 
own yard. Free. 

For a moment he stood in the 
yard, stunned. 

The dear gray sky of Old 
North Australia rolled low over- 
head; this was no longer the 
eerie light of Old Earth, where 
the heavens were supposed to 
shine perpetually blue. He 
sneezed as the dry air caught the 
tissue pf his nostrils. He felt his 
clothing chill as the moisture 
evaporated out of it; he did not 
think whether it was the wet- 
ness of the trailer-van or his 
own sweat which had made his 



shirt so wet. There were a lot of 
people there, and a lot of light. 
And the smell of roses was as 
far away as another life might 
be. 

Lavinia stood near him, weep- 
ing. 

He started to turn to her, 
when a collective gasp from the 
crowd caused him to turn 
around. 

The snake-man had come out 
of the van. (It was just an old 
theater-van, he realized at last, 
the kind which he himself had 
entered a hundred times.) His 
earth uniform looked like the 
acme of wealth and decadence 
among the dusty coveralls of the 
men and the poplin dresses of 
the women. His green complex- 
ion looked bright among the 
tanned faces of the Norstrilians. 
He saluted Rod. 

Rod did not return the salute. 
He just stared. 

Perhaps they had changed 
their minds and had sent the 
giggle death after him. 

The snake-soldier watched 
with flickering eyes. He made 
no comment, but he saluted and 
went stiffy back to the van. At 
the door he turned and looked 
over the crowd as though he 
were appraising the easiest way 
to kill them all. He said noth- 
ing, threatened nothing. He 
opened the door and put him- 
self into the van. There was no 



32 



GALAXY 



sign of who the human inhabi- 
tants of the van might be. There 
must be, thought Rod, some way 
of getting them in and out of 
the Garden of Death very secret- 
ly and very quietly, because he 
had lived around the neighbor- 
hood a long time and had never 
had the faintest idea that his 
own neighbors might sit on a 
board. 

The people were funny. They 
stood quietly in the yard, wait- 
ing for him to make the first 
move. 

He turned stiffly and looked 
around more deliberately. 

Why, it was his neighbors and 
kinfolk, all of them — McBans, 
MacArthurs, Passarellis, Sch- 
midts, even the Sanders! 

He lifted his hand in greeting 
to all of them. 

Pandemonium broke loose. 

r T' l hey rushed toward him. The 
women kissed him, the men 
patted him on the back and 
shook his hand, the little chil- 
dren began a piping little song 
about the Station of Doom. He 
had become the center of a mob 
which led him to his own kitch- 
en. 

Many of the people had begun 
to cry. 

He wondered why. Almost im- 
mediately, he understood — 

They liked him. 

For unfathomable people rea- 



sons, mixed-up non-logical hu- 
man reasons, they had wished 
him well. Even the auntie who 
had predicted a coffin for him 
was snivelling without shame, 
using a comer of her apron to 
wipe her eyes and nose. 

He had gotten tired of people, 
being a freak himself, but in 
this moment of trial their capri- 
cious goodness flowed over him 
like a great wave. He let them 
sit him down in his own kitch- 
en. Among the babies, the 
weeps, the laughter, the hearty 
and falsely cheerful relief, he 
heard a single fugue being re- 
peated again and again: they 
liked him. He had come back 
from death. 

Without liquor, it made him 
drunk. “I can’t stand it,” he 
shouted, “I like you all so dash- 
ed bloomed crutting much that 
I could beat the sentimental 
brains out of the whole crook 
lot of you. .” 

“Isn’t that a sweet speech?” 
murmured an old farm wife 
nearby. 

A policeman in full uniform 
agreed. 

The party had started. It last- 
ed three full days, and when it 
was over there was not a dry 
eye or a full bottle on the whole 
Station of Doom. 

From time to time he cleared 
up enough to enjoy his miracu- 
lous gift of hiering. He looked 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



33 



through all their minds while 
they chatted and sang and drank 
and ate and were as happy as 
Larry; there was not one of 
them who had come along vain- 
ly. They were truly rejoicing. 
They loved him. They wished 
him well. He had his doubts 
about how long that kind of love 
would last, but he enjoyed it 
while it lasted. 

Lavinia stayed out of his way 
the first day; on the second and 
third days she was gone. They 
gave him real Norstrilian beer 
to drink, which they had 
brought up to 108 proof by the 
■imple addition of raw spirits. 
With this, he forgot the Garden 
of Death, the sweet wet smells, 
the precise offworld voice of the 
Lord Redlady. 

He looked in their minds and 
over and over again he saw the 
same thing. 

“You’re our boy. You made it. 
You’re alive. Good luck, Rod, 
good luck to you, fellow. We 
didn’t have to see you stagger 
off, giggling and happy, to the 
house that you would die in.” 

Had he made it, thought Rod, 
or was it chance which had done 
it for him? 

V 

T)y the end of the week, the 
celebration was over. The 
assorted aunts and cousins had 

34 



gone back to their farms. The 
Station of Doom was quiet, and 
Rod spent the morning making 
sure that the fieldhands had not 
neglected the sheep too much 
during the prolonged party. He 
found that Daisy, a young 300- 
ton sheep, had not been turned 
for two days and had to be re- 
lanolinized on her ground side 
before earth canker set in; he 
discovered that the nutrient 
tubes for Tanner, his 1000-ton 
ram, had become jammed and 
that the poor sheep was getting 
a bad case of edema in his 
gigantic legs. Otherwise things 
were quiet. Even when he saw 
Beasley’s red pony tethered in 
his own yard, he had no pre- 
monition of trouble. 

He went cheerfully into the 
house, greeting Beasley with an 
irreverent : 

“Have a drink on me, Mister 
and Owner Beasley! Oh, you 
have one already! Have the next 
one then, sir!” 

“Thanks for the drink, lad, 
but I came to see you. On busi- 
ness.” 

“Yes sir,” said Rod. “You’re 
one of my appointed trustees, 
aren’t you?” 

“That I am,” said Beasley, 
“but you’re in trouble, lad. Real 
trouble.” 

Rod smiled at him evenly and 
calmly. He knew that the older 
man had to make a big effort 



GALAXY 



to talk with his voice instead of 
just spieking with his mind; he 
appreciated the fact that Beasley 
had come to him personally, in- 
stead of talking to the other 
trustees about him. It was a sign 
that he, Rod, had passed his or- 
deal. 

With genuine composure, Rod 
declared, “I’ve been thinking, 
sir, this week, that I’d gotten out 
of trouble.” 

“What do you mean, Owner 
McBan?” 

“You remember. .” Rod did 
not dare mention the Garden of 
Death, nor his memory that 
Beasley had been one of the 
secret board who had passed 
him as being fit to live. 

Beasley took the cue. “Some 
things we don’t mention, lad, 
and I see that you have been 
well taught.” 

He stopped there and stared 
at Rod with the expression of a 
man looking at an unfamiliar 
corpse before turning it over to 
identify it. Rod became uneasy 
with the stare. 

“Sit, lad, sit down,” said Beas- 
ley, commanding Rod in his 
own house. 

Rod sat down on the bench, 
since Beasley occupied the only 
chair — Rod’s grandfather’s 
huge, carved, offworld throne. 
He sat. He did not like being 
ordered about, but he was sure 
that Beasley meant him well 



and was probably strained by 
the unfamiliar effort of talking 
with his throat and mouth. 

Beasley looked at him again 
with that peculiar expression, a 
mixture of sympathy and dis- 
taste. 

“Get up again, lad, and look 
round your house to see if there’s 
anybody about.” 

“There isn’t,” said Rod. “My 
aunt Doris left after I was clear- 
ed, the workwoman Eleanor bor- 
rowed a cart and went off to 
market and I have only two sta- 
tion hands. They’re both out re- 
infecting Baby. She ran low on 
her santaclara count.” 

Normally, the wealth-produc- 
ing sicknesses of their gigantic 
half-paralyzed sheep would have 
engrossed the full attention of 
any two Norstrilian farmers, 
without respect to differences 
in age and grade. This time, no. 
Beasley had something serious 
and unpleasant on his mind. He 
looked so pruney and unquiet 
that Rod felt a real sympathy 
for the man. 

D od did not argue. Dutifully 

^ he went out the back door, 
looked around the south side of 
the house, saw no one, walked 
around the house on the north 
side, saw no one there either, 
and re-entered the house from 
the front door. Beasley had not 
stirred, except to pour a little 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



35 



more bitter ale from his bottle 
to his glass. Rod met his eyes. 
Without another word, Rod sat 
down. If the man was seriously 
concerned about him (which 
Rod thought Beasley was), and 
if the man was reasonably intel- 
ligent (which Rod knew he 
was), the communication was 
worth waiting for and listening 
too. Rod was still sustained by 
the pleasant feeling that his 
neighbors really liked him, a 
feeling which had come plainly 
to the surface of their honest 
Norstrilian faces when he walk- 
ed back into his own back yard 
from the van of the Garden of 
Death. 

Beasley said, as though he 
were speaking of an unfamiliar 
food or a rare drink, “Boy, this 
talking has some advantages. If 
a man doesn’t put his ear into 
it, he can’t just pick it up with 
his mind, can he, now?” 

Rod thought for a moment. 
Candidly he spoke, “I’m too 
young to know for sure, but I 
never heard of somebody pick- 
ing up spoken words by hiering 
them with his mind. It seems to 
be one or the other. You never 
talk while you are spieking, do 
you?” 

Beasley nodded. “That’s it, 
then. I have something to tell 
you which I shouldn’t tell you, 
and yet I have got to tell you. 
So if I keep my voice blooming 

36 



low, nobody else will pick it up, 
will they?” 

Rod nodded. “What is it, sir? 
Is there something wrong with 
the title to my property?” 
Beasley took a drink but kept 
staring at Rod over the top of 
the mug while he drank. 
“You’ve got trouble there too, 
lad. But even though it’s bad, 
it’s something I can talk over 
with you and with the other 
trustee. This is more personal, 
in a way. And worse.” 

“Please, sir! What is it?” 
cried Rod, almost exasperated 
by all this mystification. 

“The Onseck is after you.” 
“What’s an onseck?” said 
Rod, “I have never heard of it.” 
“It’s not an it,” said Beasley 
gloomily, “it’s a him. Onseck, 
you know, the chap in the Com- 
monwealth government. The 
man who keeps the books for 
the vice-chairman. It was Hon- 
Sec., meaning Honorary Secre- 
tary or something else prehis- 
toric, when we first came to this 
planet, but by now everybody 
just says Onseck and writes it 
just the way it sounds. He knows 
that he can’t reverse your hear- 
ing in the Garden of Death.” 
“Nobody could!” cried Rod. 
“It’s never been done; every- 
body knows that.” 

“They may know it, but there’s 
civil trial.” 

“How can they give me a civil 
GALAXY 



trial when I haven’t had time 
to change? You yourself must 
know — ?” 

“Never, laddie, never say what 
Beasley knows or doesn’t know. 
Just say what you think.” Even 
in private, between just the two 
of them, Beasley did not want 
to violate the fundamental se- 
crecy of the hearing in the Gar- 
den of Death. 

“I’m just going to say, Mister 
and Owner Beasley,” said Rod 
very heatedly, “that a civil trial 
for general incompetence is 
something which is applied to 
an owner only after the neigh- 
bors have been complaining for 
a long time about him. They 
haven’t had the time or the 
right to complain about me, 
have they now?” 

Beasley kept his hand on the 
handle of his mug. The use of 
spoken words tired him. A 
crown of sweat began to show 
around the top of his forehead. 

“Suppose, lad,” said he very 
solemnly, “that I knew through 
proper channels something 
about how you were judged in 
that van — there! I’ve said it, 
me that shouldn’t have. And 
suppose that I knew the Onseck 
hated a foreign gentleman that 
might have been in a van like 
that — ” 

“The Lord Redlady?” whis- 
pered Rod, shocked at last by 
the fact that Beasley forced him- 



self to talk about the unmen- 
tionable. 

“Aye,” nodded Beasley, his 
honest face close to breaking in- 
to tears, “and suppose that I 
knew that the Onseck knew you 
and felt the rule was wrong, all 
wrong, that you were a freak 
who would hurt all Norstrilia, 
what would I do?” 

“I don’t know,” said Rod. 
“Tell me, perhaps?” 

“Never,” said Beasley. “I’m 
an honest man. Get me another 
drink.” 

O od walked over to the cup- 
board, brought out another 
bottle of bitter ale, wondering 
where or when he might have 
known the Onseck. He had nev- 
er had much of anything to do 
with government. His family — 
first his grandfather, while he 
lived, and then his aunts and 
cousins — had taken care of all 
the official papers and permits 
and things. 

Beasley drank deeply. “Good 
ale, this. Hard work, talking, 
even though it’s a fine way to 
keep a secret, if you’re pretty 
sure nobody can peep our 
minds.” 

“I don’t know him,” said Rod. 

“Who?” asked Beasley, mo- 
mentarily off his trail of thought. 

“The Onseck. I don’t know 
any Onseck. I’ve never been to 
New Canberra. I’ve never seen 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH

an official — no, nor an off- 
worlder neither, not until I met 
that foreign gentleman we were 
talking about. How can the On- 
seck know me if I don’t know 
him?” 

“But you did, laddie. He 
wasn’t Onseck then.” 

“For sheep’s sake, sir,” said 
Rod, “tell me who it is!” 

“Never use violent language 
when simple thoughts are clear- 
er,” said Beasley glumly. 

“I’m sorry, sir. I apologize. 
Who was it?” 

“Houghton Syme to the hun- 
dred-and-forty-ninth,” then said 
Beasley. 

“We have no neighbor of that 
name, sir.” 

“No, we don’t,” said Beasley 
hoarsely, as though he had come 
to the end of his road in impart- 
ing secrets. 

Rod stared at him, still puz- 
zled. 

In the far, far distance way 
beyond Pillow Hill, his giant 
sheep baa’d. That probably 
meant that Hopper was hoisting 
her into a new position on her 
platform so that she could reach 
fresh grass. 

Beasley brought his face close 
to Rod’s. He whispered, and it 
was funny to see the hash a nor- 
mal man made out of whispering 
when he hadn’t even talked with 
his voice for half a year. 

His words had a low, dirty 



tone to them, as though he were 
going to tell Rod an extremely 
filthy story or ask him some 
personal and most improper 
question. 

“Your life, laddie,” he gasped. 
“I know you’ve had a rum one. 
I hate to ask you, but I must. 
How much do you know of your 
own life?” 

“Oh, that,” said Rod easily. 
“That. I don’t mind being asked 
that, even if it is a little wrong-o. 
I have had four childhoods, 
zero to sixteen each time. My 
family kept hoping that I would 
grow up to spiek and hier like 
everybody else, but I just stayed 
me. Of course, I wasn’t a real 
baby on the three times they 
started me over, just sort of an 
educated idiot the size of a boy 
sixteen.” 

“That’s it, /ad. But can you 
remember them, those other 
lives?” 

“Bits and pieces, sir. Pieces 
and bits. It didn’t hold togeth- 
er — ” He checked himself and 
gasped, “Houghton Syme! 
Houghton Syme! Old Hot and 
Simple. Of course I know him. 
The one-shot boy. I knew him 
in my first prepper, in my first 
childhood. We were pretty good 
friends, but we hated each other 
anyhow. I was a freak and he 
was too. I couldn’t spiek and 
hier, and he couldn’t take 
stroon. That meant that I would 



38 



GALAXY 



never get through the Garden of 
Death — just the giggle room 
and a fine owner’s coffin for 
me. And him — he was worse. 
He would just get an Old Earth 
lifetime — a hundred and sixty 
years or so and then blotto. He 
must be an oldish man now. 
Poor chap! How did he get to 
be Onseck? What power does an 
Onseck have?” 

UVTow you have it, laddie. He 
' says he’s your friend and 
that he hates to do it, but he’s 
got to see to it that you are killed 
— for the good of Norstrilia. 
He says it’s his duty. He got to 
be Onseck because he was always 
jawing about his duty and peo- 
ple were a little sorry for him 
because he was going to die so 
soon, just one Old Earth lifetime 
with all the stroon in the uni- 
verse produced around his feet 
and him unable to take it — ” 
“They never cured him, then?” 
“Never,” said Beasley. “He’s 
an old man now, and bitter. And 
he’s sworn to see you die.” 

“Can he do it? Being Onseck, 
I mean.” 

“He might. He hates that for- 
eign gentleman we were talking 
about because the offworlder 
told him he was a provincial 
fool. He hates you because you 
will live and he will not. What 
was it you called him in school?” 
“Old Hot and Simple.” 



“He’s not hot and he’s not 
simple. He’s cold and compli- 
cated and cruel and unhappy. If 
we didn’t all of us think that 
he was going to die in a little 
while, ten or a hundred years or 
so, we might vote him into a 
giggle room ourselves. For mis- 
ery and incompetence. But he is 
Onseck and he’s after you. I’ve 
said it now. I shouldn’t have. But 
when I saw that sly cold face 
talking about you and trying to 
declare your board incompetent 
right while you, laddie, were 
having an honest binge with 
your family and neighbors at 
having gotten through at last — 
when I saw that white sly face 
creeping around where you 
couldn’t even see him for a fair 
fight — than I said to myself. 
Rod McBan may not be a man 
officially, but the poor clodding 
crutt has paid the full price for 
being a man. So I’ve told you. 
I have taken a chance, and I may 
have hurt my honor." Beasley 
sighed. His honest red face was 
troubled indeed. “I may have 
have hurt my honor, a sore 
thing here in Norstrilia where 
a man can live as long as he 
wants. But I’m glad I did. Be- 
sides, my throat is sore with all 
this talking. Give me another 
bottle of bitter ale, lad, before I 
go and get my horse.” 
Wordlessly Rod got him the 
ale and poured it for him. 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



39 



Beasley, uninclined to do any 
more talking, sipped at the ale. 
Perhaps, thought Rod, he is hier- 
ing around carefully to see if 
there have been any human 
minds nearby which might have 
picked up the telepathic leakage 
from the conversation. 

As Beasley handed back the 
mug and started to leave with a 
wordless neighborly nod, Rod 
could not restrain himself from 
asking one last question, which 
he spoke in a hissed whisper. 
Beasley had gotten his mind so 
far off the subject of sound talk 
that he merely stared at Rod. 
Perhaps, Rod thought, he is ask- 
ing me to spiek plainly because 
he has forgotten that I cannot 
spiek at all. That was the case, 
because Beasley croaked in a 
very hoarse voice: 

“What is it, lad? Don’t make 
me talk much. My voice is 
scratching me and my honor is 
sore within me.” 

“What should I do, sir? What 
should I do?” 

“Mister and Owner McBan, 
that’s your problem. I’m not you. 
I wouldn’t know.” 

“But what would you do, sir? 
Suppose you were me.” 

Beasley’s blue eye’s looked 
over at Pillow Hill for a mo- 
ment, abstractedly. “Get off- 
planet. Get off. Go away. For a 
hundred years or so. Then that 
man — him — he’ll be dead in 



due time and you can come 
back, fresh as a new-blossomed 
twinkle.” 

“But how, sir? How can I do 
it?” 

Beasley patted him on his 
shoulder, gave him a broad 
wordless smile, put his foot in 
his stirrup, sprang into his sad- 
dle and looked down at Rod. 

“I wouldn’t know, neighbor. 
But good luck to you, just the 
same. I’ve done more than I 
should. Good-by.” 

He slapped his horse gently 
with his open hand and trotted 
out of the yard. At the edge of 
the yard the horse changed to a 
canter. 

Rod stood in his own doorway, 
utterly alone. 

VI 

A fter Beasley left, Rod loped 
miserably around his farm. 

He missed his grandfather, 
who had been living during his 
first three childhoods, but who 
had died while Rod was going 
through a fourth, simulated in- 
fancy in an attempt to cure his 
telepathic handicap. He even 
missed his Aunt Margot, who 
had voluntarily gone into With- 
drawal at the age of 902. There 
were plenty of cousins and kins- 
men from whom he could ask 
advice; there were the legal trus- 
tees of the Station of Doom; 



40 



GALAXY 



there were the two hands on the 
farm; there was even the chance 
that he could go see Mother 
Hitton herself, because she had 
once been married to one of his 
great 11 - uncles. But this time he 
did not want companionship. 
There was nothing he could do 
with people. The Onseck was 
people too; imagine old “hot 
and simple” becoming a power 
in the land. Rod knew that this 
was his own fight. 

His own. 

What had ever been his own 
before? 

Not even his life. He could 
remember bits about the differ- 
ent boyhoods he had. He even 
had vague uncomfortable glimps- 
es of seasons of pain — 
the times they had sent him 
back to babyhood while leaving 
him large. That hadn’t been his 
choice. The old man had order- 
ed it or the Vice-chairman had 
approved it or Aunt Margot had 
begged for it. Nobody had asked 
him much, except to say, “You 
will agree. .” 

He had agreed. 

He had been good — so good 
that he hated them all at times 
and wondered if they knew he 
hated them. The hate never last- 
ed, because the real people in- 
volved were too well-meaning, 
too kind, too ambitious for his 
own sake. He had to love them 
back. 



Trying to think these things 
over, he loped around his estate 
on foot 

The big sheep lay on their 
platform, forever sick, forever 
gigantic. Perhaps some of them 
remembered where they had 
been lambs, free to run through 
the sparse grass, free to push 
their heads through the pliofilm 
covers of the canals and to help 
themselves to water when they 
wanted to drink. Now they 
weighed hundreds of tons and 
were fed by feeding machines, 
watched by guard machines, 
checked by automatic doctors. 
They were fed and watered a 
little through the mouth only 
because pastoral experience 
showed that they stayed fatter 
and lived longer if a semblance 
of normality were left to them. 

His aunt Doris, who kept 
house for him, was still away. 

His workwoman Eleanor, 
whom he paid an annual sum 
larger than many planets paid 
for their entire armed forces, 
had gone to market. 

The two sheephands, Bill and 
Hopper, were still out. 

And he did not want to talk 
to them, anyhow. 

He wished that he could see 
the Lord Redlady, that strange 
offworld man whom he had met 
in the Garden of Death. The 
Lord Redlady just looked as 
though he knew more things 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



41 



than Norstrilians did, as though 
he came from sharper, crueller, 
wiser societies than most people 
in Old North Australia had ever 
seen. 

But you can’t ask for a Lord. 
Particularly not when you have 
met him only in a secret hearing. 

Rod had gotten to the final 
limits of his own land. 

Humphrey’s Lawsuit lay be- 
yond — a broad strip of poor 
land, completely untended, the 
building-high ribs of long-dead 
sheep skeletons making weird 
shadows as the sun began to set. 
The Humphrey family had been 
lawing over that land for hun- 
dreds of years. Meanwhile it lay 
waste except for the few author- 
ized public animals which the 
Commonwealth was allowed to 
put on any land, public or pri- 
vate. 

Rod knew that freedom was 
only two steps away. 

All he had to do was to step 
over the line and shout with his 
mind for people. He could do 
that even though he could not 
really spiek. A telepathic garble 
of alarm would bring the orbit- 
ing guards down to him in seven 
or eight minutes. Then he would 
need only to say: 

“I swear off title. I give up 
mistership and ownership. I de- 
mand my living from the Com- 
monwealth. Watch me, people, 
while I repeat.” 



Three repetitions of this would 
make him an Official Pauper, 
with not a care left — no meet- 
ings, no land to tend, no account- 
ing to do, nothing but to 
wander around Old North Aus- 
tralia picking up any job he 
wanted and quitting it whenever 
he wanted. It was a good life, a 
free life, the best the Common- 
wealth could offer to squatters 
and owners who otherwise lived 
long centuries of care, responsi- 
bility and honor. It was a fine 
life — 

But no McBan had ever taken 
it. Not even a cousin. 

Nor could he. 

He went back to the house, 
miserable. He listened to Elea- 
nor talking with Bill and Hop- 
per while dinner was served — 
a huge plate of boiled mutton, 
potatoes, hard-boiled eggs, sta- 
tion-brewed beer out of the keg. 
(There were planets, he knew, 
where people never tasted such 
food from birth to death. There 
they lived on impregnated paste- 
board which was salvaged from 
the latrines, reimpregnated with 
nutrients and vitamins, deodor- 
ized and sterilized and issued 
again the next day.) He knew 
it was a fine dinner, but he did 
not care. 

How could he talk about the 
Onseck to these people? 

He dropped the rest of the 
’inner into his stomach as 



42 



GALAXY 



though it were sheep-food pel- 
lets, and went to his bedroom 
early. 

For the first time in his life, 
he slept badly. 

And out of the badsleep, the 
answer came. 

“Ask Hamlet.” 

Hamlet was not even a man. 
He was just a talking picture in 
a cave, but he was wise, he was 
from Old Earth Itself, and he 
had no friends to whom to give 
Rod’s secrets. 

With this idea, Rod turned on 
his sleeping shelf and went into 
a deep sleep. 

I n the morning his Aunt Doris 
was still not back, so he told 
the workwoman Eleanor: 

“I’ll be gone all day. Don’t 
look for me or worry about me.” 
“What about your lunch, mis- 
ter and owner? You can’t run 
around the station with no tuck- 
er.” 

‘Wrap some up, then.” 
“Where’re you going, mister 
and owner, sir, if you can tell 
me?” There was an unpleasant 
searching edge in her voice, as 
though — being the only adult 
woman present — she had to 
check on him as though he were 
still a child. He didn’t like it, 
but he replied with a frank 
enough air. 

“I’m not leaving the station. 
I just need to think.” 



More kindly she said, “You 
think, then, Rod. Just go right 
ahead and think. If you ask me, 
you ought to go live with a 
family — ” 

‘I know what you’ve said,” he 
interrupted her. “I’m not mak- 
ing any big decisions today, 
Eleanor. Just rambling and 
thinking.” 

“All right then, mister and 
owner. Ramble around and 
worry about the ground you’re 
walking on. It’s you that get the 
worries for it. I’m glad my 
daddy took the official pauper 
words. We used to be rich.” Un- 
expectedly she brightened and 
laughed at herself. “Now that, 
you’ve heard that too, Rod. 
Here’s your food. Do you have 
your water?” 

“I’ll steal from the sheep,” he 
said irreverently. She knew he 
was joking and she waved him a 
friendly good-by. 

The old, old gap was to the 
rear of the house, so he left by 
the front. He wanted to go the 
long wrong way around, so that 
neither human eyes nor hu- 
man minds would stumble on the 
secret he had found fifty-six years 
before, the first time he was eight 
years old. 

Through all the pain and the 
troubles he had remembered this 
one vivid bright secret — the 
deep cave full of treasures. To 
these he must go. 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH

nphe sun was high in the sky, 
spreading its patch of bright- 
er gray above the gray clouds, 
when he slid into what looked 
like a dry irrigation ditch. 

He walked a few steps along 
the ditch. Then he stopped and 
listened carefully, very carefully. 

There was no sound except for 
the snoring of a young hundred- 
ton ram a mile or so away. 

Rod then stared around. 

In the far distance, a police 
omithopter soared as lazy as a 
sated hawk. 

Rod tried desperately much 
to hier. 

He heard nothing with his 
mind, but with his ears he heard 
the slow heavy pulsing of his 
own blood pounding through his 
head. 

He took a chance. 

The trapdoor was there, just 
inside the edge of the culvert. 

He lifted it and, leaving it 
open, dove in as confidently as 
a swimmer knifing his way into 
a familiar pool. 

He knew his way. 

His clothes ripped a little but 
the weight of his body dragged 
him past the narrowness of the 
doorframe. 

His hands reached out and 
like the hands of an acrobat they 
caught the inner bar. The door 
behind snapped shut How 



frightening this had been when 
he was little and tried the trip 
for the first time! He had let 
himself down with a rope and 
a torch, never realizing the im- 
portance of the trap-door at the 
edge of the culvert! 

Now it was easy. 

With a thud, he landed on his 
feet. The bright old illegal lights 
went on. The dehumidifier be- 
gan to purr, lest the wetness of 
his breath spoil the treasures in 
the room. 

There were drama-cubes by 
the score, with two different 
sizes of projectors. There were 
heaps of clothing, for both men 
and women, left over from for- 
gotten ages. In a chest, in the 
corner, there was even a small 
machine from before the Age of 
Space, a crude but beautiful 
little mechanical chronograph, 
completely without resonance 
compensation, and the ancient 
name “Jaeger Le Coultre” 
written across its face. It still 
kept earth time after fifteen 
thousand years. 

Rod sat down in an utterly 
impermissable chair — one 
which seemed to be a complex 
of pillows built on an interlock- 
ing frame. The touch alone was 
a medicine for his worries. One 
chair-leg was broken, but that 
was the way his grandfather-to- 
the-nineteenth had violated the 
Clean Sweep. 



GALAXY 



The Clean Sweep had been 
Old North Australia’s last politi- 
cal crisis many centuries before, 
when the last underpeople were 
hunted down and driven off the 
planet and when all damaging 
luxuries had to be turned in to 
the Commonwealth authorities, 
to be re-purchased by their own- 
ers only at a re-valuation twenty 
thousand times higher than 
their assessed worth. It was the 
final effort to keep Norstrilians 
simple, healthy and well. Every 
citizen had to swear that he had 
turned in every single item, and 
the oath had been taken with 
thousands of telepaths watching. 
It was a testimony to the high 
mental power and adept deceit- 
fulness of grandfather-to-the- 
nineteenth that Rod McBan 
CXXX had inflicted only sym- 
bolic breakage on his favorite 
treasures, some of which were 
not even in the categories allow- 
ed for re-purchase, like off- 
world drama-cubes, and had 
been able to hide his things in 
an unimportant corner of his 
fields — hide them so well that 
neither robbers nor police had 
thought of them since. 

Rod picked up his favorite. 
Hamlet, by William Shake- 
speare. Without viewer, the cube 
was designed to act when touch- 
ed by a true human being. 
The top of the cube became a 
little stage, the actors appeared 



as bright miniatures speaking 
Ancient Inglish, a language very 
close to Old North Australian, 
and the telepathic commentary, 
cued to the Old Common 
Tongue, rounded out the story. 
Since Rod was not dependably 
telepathic, he had learned a 
great deal of the Ancient Inglish 
by trying to understanding the 
dramas without the commen- 
tary. He did not like what he 
first saw and he shook the cube 
until the play approached its 
end. At last he heard the dear 
high familiar voice speaking in 
Hamlet’s last scene: 



I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, 
adieu! 

You that look pale and tremble at 
this chance. 

That are but mutes or audience to 
this act, 

Had I but time — as this fell sergeant, 
death, 

Is strict in his arrest — O! I could 
tell you — 

But let it be, Horatio, I am dead. 

Rod shook the cube very gently 
and the scene sped down a few 
lines. Hamlet was still talking: 

. what a wounded name, 

Things standing thus unknown, shaU 
live behind me. 

If thou didst ever hold me In thy 
heart. 

Absent thee from felicity a while. 

And in this harsh world draw thy 
breath In pain 

To tell my story. 

Rod put down the cube very 
gently. 

The bright little figures dis- 
appeared. 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



45 



The room was silent. 

But he had the answer and it 
was wisdom. And wisdom, coeval 
with man, comes unannounced, 
unbidden, and unwelcome into 
every life; Rod found that he 
had discovered the answer to a 
basic problem. 

T>ut not his own problem. The 

answer was Houghton Symes, 
old Hot and Simple. 

It was the Hon. Sec. who was 
already dying of a wounded 
name. Hence the persecution. It 
was the Onseck who had the 
“fell sergeant, death” acting 
strictly in his arrest, even if the 
arrest were only a few decades 
off instead of a few minutes. He, 
Rod McBan, was to live; his old 
acquaintance was to die; and the 
dying — oh. the dying, always, 
always! — could not help resent- 
ing the survivors, even if they 
were loved ones, at least for a 
little bit. 

Hence the Onseck. 

But what of himself? 

Rod brushed a pile of price- 
less, illegal manuscripts out of 
the way and picked up a small 
book marked, Reconstituted 
Late Inglish Language Verse. 
At each page as it opened, 
a young man or woman seven 
centimeteis high stood up bright- 
ly on the page and recited the 
text. Rod ruffled the pages of 
the old book so that the little 



figures appeared and tt cm bled 
and fled like weak flames seen 
on a bright day. One caught his 
eye and he stopped the page at 
mid-poem. The figure was say- 
ing: 

The challenge holds. I cannot now 
retract 

The boast I made to that relentless 
court. 

The hostile Justice of my self-con- 
tempt. 

If now the ordeal Is prepared, my 
act 

Must soon be shown. I pray that 
It Is short. 

And never dream that I shall be 
exempt. 

He glanced at the foot of the 
page and saw the name, Casimir 
Colegrove. Of course, he had 
seen that name before. An old 
poet. A good one. But what did 
the words mean to him, Rod 
McBan, sitting in a hidden hole 
within the limits of his own 
land? He was a Mister and Own- 
er, in all except final title, and 
he was running from an enemy 
he could not define. 

“The hostile justice of my 
self -contempt . .” 

That was the key of it! He had 
not run from the Onseck. He 
had run from himself. He took 
justice itself as hostile because 
it corresponded with his sixty- 
odd years of boyhood, his end- 
less disappointment, his compli- 
ance with things which would 
never, till all worlds burned, be 
complied with. How could he 
hier and spiek like other people 
if somewhere a dominant fea- 
ture had turned recessive? 



46 



GALAXY 



Hadn't real justice already vin- 
dicated him and cleared him? 

It was himself who was cruel. 

Other people were kind. 
(Shrewdness made him add, 
“sometimes.”) 

He had taken his own inner 
sense of trouble and had made 
it fit the outside world, like the 
morbid little poems he had read 
a long time ago. It was some- 
where right in this room, and 
when he had first read it, he 
felt that the long-dead writer 
had put it down for himself 
alone. But it wasn’t really so. 
Other people had had their trou- 
bles too and the poem had ex- 
pressed something older than 
Rod McBan. It went. 

The wheels of fate are spinning 
around. 

Between them the souls of men are 
ground. 

Who strive for throats to make some 
sound 

Of protest out of the mad profound 

Trap of the godmachine! 

“Godmachine,” though Rod, 
“now that’s a due. I’ve got the 
only all-mechanical computer on 
this planet. I’ll play it on the 
stroon crop speculations, win all 
or lose all.” 

The boy stood up in the for- 
bidden room. 

“Fight it is,” he said to the 
cubes on the floor, “and a good 
thanks to you, grandfather-to- 
the-nineteenth. You met the law 
and did not lose. And now it is 
my turn to be Rod McBan.” 



He turned and shouted to 
himself : 

“To earth!” 

The call embarrassed him. 
He felt unseen eyes staring at 
him. He almost blushed, and 
would have hated himself if he 
had. 

He stood on the top of a treas- 
ure-chest turned on its side. Two 
more gold coins, worthless as 
money but priceless as curios, 
fell noiselessly on the thick old 
rugs. He thought a good-by again 
to his secret room and he jump- 
ed upward for the bar. He 
caught it, chinned himself, 
raised himself higher, swung a 
leg on it but not over it, got his 
other foot on the bar and then, 
very carefully but with the pow- 
er of all his muscles, pushed 
himself into the black opening 
above. The lights suddenly went 
off, the dehumidifier hummed 
louder, and the daylight dazzled 
him as the trapdoor, touched, 
flung itself open. 

He thrust his head into the 
culvert. The daylight seemed 
deep gray after the brilliance of 
the treasure room. 

All silent. All clear. He rolled 
into the ditch. 

The door, with silence and 
power, closed itself behind him. 
He was never to know it, but it 
had been cued to the genetic 
code of the descendants of Rod 
McBan. Had any other person 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH

touched it, it would have with- 
stood them for a long time. Al- 
most forever. 

You see, it was not really his 
door. He was its boy. 

C4 r T''his land has made me,” 
said Rod aloud, as he 
clambered out of the ditch and 
looked around. 

The young ram had apparent- 
ly wakened; his snoring had 
stopped and over the quiet hill 
there came the sound of his pant- 
ing. Thirsty again! The Station 
of Doom was not so rich that it 
could afford unlimited water to 
its giant sheep. They lived all 
right. Rod would have asked the 
trustees to sell even the sheep 
for water, if a real drought set 
in. But never the land. 

Never the land. 

No land for sale. 

It didn’t even really belong to 
him: he belonged to it — the 
rolling dry fields, the covered 
rivers and canals, the sly catch- 
ments which caught every drop 
which might otherwise have gone 
to his neighbors. That was the 
pastoral business — its product 
immortality and its price water. 
The Commonwealth could have 
flooded the planet or created 
oceans, with the financial re- 
sources it had at command, but 
the planet and the people were 
regarded as one ecological entity. 
Old Australia — the fabulous 

48 



continent of old Earth now cov- 
ered by the ruins of the aban- 
doned Chinesian cityworld of 
Nanbien — had in its prime 
been broad, dry, open, beautiful; 
the planet of Old North Austra- 
lia, by the dead weight of its 
own tradition, had to remain the 
same. 

Imagine trees. Imagine leaves 

— vegetation dropping uneaten 
to the ground. Imagine water 
pouring by the thousands of 
tons, no one greeting it with 
tears of relief or happy laugh- 
ter! Imagine Earth — Old Earth 

— Manhome itself. Rod had tried 
to think of a whole planet in- 
habited by Hamlets, drenched 
with music and poetry, knee- 
deep in blood and drama. It was 
unimaginable, really, though he 
had tried to think it through. 

Like a chill, a drill, a thrill 
cutting into his very nerves he 
thought: 

Imagine Earth women! 

What terrifying beautiful 
things they must be! Dedicated 
to ancient and corruptive arts, 
surrounded by the objects which 
Norstrilia had forbidden long 
ago stimulated by experiences 
which the very law of his own 
world had expunged from the 
books! He would meet them; he 
couldn’t help it; what, what 
would he do when he met a 
genuine Earth woman? 

He would have to ask his com- 

GALAXY 




49 



puter, even though the neigh- 
bors laughed at him for having 
the only pure computer left on 
the planet. 

They didn’t know what grand- 
father to-the-nineteenth had 
done. He had taught the com- 
puter to lie. It stored all the 
forbidden things which the Law 
of the Clean Sweep had brushed 
out of Norstrilian experience. It 
could lie like a trooper. Rod 
wondered whether “a trooper” 
might be some archaic Earth of- 
ficial who did nothing but tell 
the untruth, day in and day out, 
for his living. But the computer 
usually did not lie to him. 

If grandfather 19 had behaved 
as saucily and unconventionally 
with the computer as he had 
with everything else, that parti- 
cular computer would know all 
about women. Even things' which 
they did not themselves know. 
Or wish to know. 

Good computer! thought Rod 
as he trotted around the long, 
long fields to his house. Eleanor 
would have the tucker on. Doris 
might be back. Bill and Hopper 
would be angry if they had to 
wait for the mister before they 
ate. To speed up his trip, he 
headed straight for the little 
cliff behind the house, hoping 
no one would see him jump down 
it. He was much stronger than 
most of the men he knew, but 
he was anxious, for some private 



inexpressible reason, for them 
not to know it. 

He found the cliff. 

He dropped over it, feet first, 
his heels kicking up the scree 
as he tobogganed through loose 
rock to the foot of the slope. 

And aunt Doris was there. 

“Where have you been?” said 
she. 

“Walking, mum,” said he. 

She gave him a quizzical look 
but knew better than to ask 
more. Talking always fussed her, 
anyhow. She hated the sound of 
her voice, which she considered 
much too high. The matter 
passed. 

Inside the house, they ate. Be- 
yond the door and the oil lamp, 
a gray world became moonless, 
starless, black. This was night, 
his own night. 

VIII 

\ t the end of the meal he 
■**- waited for Doris to say grace 
to the Queen. She did, but 
under her thick eyebrows her 
eyes expressed something other 
than thanks. 

“You’re going out,” she said 
right after the prayer. It was an 
accusation, not a question. 

The two hired men looked at 
him with quiet doubt. A week 
ago he had been a boy. Now he 
was the same person, but legally 
a man. 



50 



GALAXY 



Workwoman Eleanor looked 
at him too. She smiled very un- 
obtrusively to herself. She was 
on his side whenever any other 
person came into the picture; 
when they were alone, she 
nagged him as much as she 
dared. She had known his par- 
ents before they went offworld 
for a long-overdue honeymoon 
and were chewed into molecules 
by a battle between raiders and 
police. That gave her a proprie- 
tary feeling about him. 

He tried to spiek to Doris with 
his mind, just to see if it would 
work. 

It didn’t. The two men bound- 
ed from their seats and ran for 
the yard, Eleanor sat in her 
chair holding tight to the table 
but saying nothing and aunt 
Doris screeched so loud that he 
could not make out the words. 

He knew she meant “Stop 
it!”, so he did, and looked at 
them friendly. 

That started a fight. 

Quarrels were common in 
Norstrilian life, because the Fa- 
thers had taught that they were 
therapeutic. Children could 
quarrel until adults told them 
to stop, freemen could quarrel 
as long as misters were not in- 
volved, misters could quarrel as 
long as an owner was not pres- 
ent, and owners could quarrel 
if, at the very end, they were 
willing to fight it out. No one 



could quarrel in the presence of 
an offworlder, nor during an 
alert, nor with a member of the 
defense or police on active duty. 

Rod McBan was a mister and 
owner, but he was under trustee- 
ship; he was a man, but he had 
not been given clear papers; he 
was a handicapped person. 

The rules got all mixed up. 

When Hopper came back to 
the table he muttered, “Do that 
again, laddie, and I’ll clout you 
one that you won’t forget!” Con- 
sidering how rarely he used his 
voice, it was a beautiful man’s 
voice, resonant, baritone, full- 
bodied, hearty and sincere in 
the way the individual words 
came out. 

Bill didn’t say a word, but from 
the contortions of his face Rod 
gathered that he was spieking to 
the others at a great rate and 
working off his grievance that 
way. 

“If you’re spieking about me, 
Bill,” said Rod with a touch of 
arrogance which he did not real- 
ly feel, “you’ll do me the pleas- 
ure of using words or you’ll get 
off my land!” 

When Bill spoke, his voice 
was as rusty as an old machine. 
“I’ll have you know, you clutty 
little pommy, that I have more 
money in my name on Sidney 
’Change than you and your 
whole glubby land are worth. 
Don’t you tell me twice to get 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



51 



off the land, you silly half of a 
mister, or I will get. So shut up!” 

Rod felt his stomach knot 
with anger. 

His anger became fiercer 
when he felt Eleanor’s restrain- 
ing hand on his arm. He didn’t 
want another person, not one 
more damned useless normal 
person, to tell him what to do 
about spieking and hiering. Aunt 
Doris’s face was still hidden in 
her apron; she had escaped, as 
she always did, into weeping. 

Just as he was about to speak 
again, perhaps to lose Bill from 
the farm forever, his mind lifted 
in the mysterious way that it did 
sometime ; he could hier for miles. 
The people around him did not 
notice the difference. He saw 
the proud rage of Bill, with his 
money in the Sidney Exchange, 
bigger than many station owners 
had, waiting his time to buy 
back on the land which his fa- 
ther had left; he saw the honest 
annoyance of Hopper and was 
a little abashed to see that Hop- 
per was watching him proudly 
and with amused affection; in 
Eleanor he saw nothing but 
wordless worry, a fear that she 
might lose him as she had lost 
so many homes, for hnnnhnnn- 
hnn dzzmmmmm, a queer mean- 
ingless reference which had a 
shape in her mind but took no 
form in his; and in aunt Doris 
he caught her inner voice call- 



ing, “Rod, Rod, Rod, come back! 
This may be your boy and I’m 
a McBan to the death, but I’ll 
never know what to do with a 
cripple like him.” 

T)ill was still waiting for him 
to answer when another 
thought came into his mind : 
“You fool — go to your com- 
puter!” 

“Who said that?” he thought, 
not trying to spiek again, but 
just thinking it with his mind. 

“Your computer,” said the 
faraway thinkvoice. 

“You can’t spiek!” said Rod. 
“You’re a pure machine with 
not an animal brain in you.” 
“When you call me, Roderick 
Frederick Ronald Arnold Wil- 
liam MacArthur McBan to the 
hundred and fifty first, I can 
speak across space itself. I’m 
cued to you and you shouted 
just now with your spiekmind. I 
can feel you hiering me.” 

“But — ” said Rod in words. 
“Take it easy, lad,” said Bill, 
right in the room with him. 
“Take it easy. I didn’t mean it.” 
“You’re having one of your 
spells,” said Aunt Doris, emerg- 
ing rednosed from behind her 
apron. 

Rod stood up. 

Said he to all of them, “I’m 
sorry. I’m going out for a bit.” 
“You’re going to that bloody 
computer,” said Bill. 



52 



GALAXY 



"Don’t go, mister McBan,” 
said Hopper, “don’t let us anger 
you into going. It’s bad enough 
being around that computer in 
daylight, but at night it must be 
horrible.” 

“How would you know?” re- 
torted Rod. “You’ve never been 
there at night. And I have. Lots 
of times. 

“There are dead people in it,” 
said Hopper. “It’s an old war 
computer. Your family should 
never have bought it in the first 
place. It doesn’t belong on a 
farm. A thing like that should 
be hung out in space and or- 
bited.” 

“All right, Eleanor,” said Rod, 
“you tell me what to do. Every- 
body else has,” he added with 
the last bit of his remaining 
anger, as his hiering closed down 
and he saw the usual opaque 
faces around him at the unclear- 
ed table. 

“It’s no use, Rod. Go along 
to your computer. You’ve got a 
strange life and you’re the one 
that will live it, Mister McBan, 
and not these other people 
around here.” 

Her words made sense to him, 
even then. 

He stood up. “I’m sorry,” said 
he, again, in lieu of a better 
good-by. 

He stood in the doorway, hesi- 
tant. He would have liked to say 
good-by in a better way, but he 



did not know how to express it. 
Anyhow, he couldn’t spiek, not 
so they could hier it with their 
minds; speaking with a voice was 
so crude, so flat for the fine 
little things that needed expres- 
sion in life. 

They looked at him, and he 
at them. 

“Ngahh!” said he, in a raw 
cry of self-derision and fond 
disgust. 

Their expressions showed that 
they had gotten his meaning, 
though the word carried noth- 
ing with it. Bill nodded, Hopper 
looked friendly and a little wor- 
ried, Aunt Doris stopped snivel- 
ling and began to stretch out 
one hand, only to stop it in mid- 
gesture and Eleanor sat immo- 
bile at the table, upset by word- 
less troubles of her own. 

He turned. 

The cube of lamplight, the 
cabin room, was behind him. 
Ahead was the darkness of all 
Norstrilian nights, except for 
the weird rare times that they 
were cut up by traceries of light- 
ness. He started off for a house 
which only a few but he could 
see, and which none but he 
could enter. It was a forgotten, 
invisible temple; it housed the 
MacArthur family computer, to 
which the older McBan com- 
puter was linked; and it was 
called the Palace of the Gover- 
nor of Night. 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH

n od loped across the rolling 

^ land, his land. 

Other Norstrilians, telepathi- 
cally normal, would have taken 
fixes by hiering the words in 
nearby houses. Rod could not 
guide his walk by telepathy, so 
he whistled to himself in an 
odd off-key with lots of flats. 
Echoes, very faint, pulsed back 
to his unconscious mind; he got 
them through the overdeveloped 
hearing which he had worked 
out for not being able to hier 
with his mind. He sensed a slope 
ahead of himself and jogged up 
it: he avoided a clump of brush; 
he heard his youngest ram, 
Sweet William, two hills over, 
snoring the resounding snore of 
a santaclara-infected sheep. 

Soon he would see it — the 
Palace of the Governor of Night, 
forever luminescent in the ultra- 
violet band. It was a Daimoni- 
built palace once, long, long 
ago. It had been built for the 
Governor of Night on Khufu II, 
where they used to raise the 
Furry Mountain Fur But the 
Fur was gone and the Khufuans 
starved, and the palace had gone 
up for sale when there was no 
more a Governor of Night. 

William MacArthur — “Wild 
William." they called him — 
had bought it for a prodigious 
price and shipped it to his farm. 



It was a replica of the Temple 
of Diana at Ephesus, way back 
on Manhome Earth itself. Nor- 
mal people could not see it, 
since it was visible only in the 
ultra-violet band. Sometimes, 
with a real mean dust storm, the 
dust outlined it and the palace 
then showed up in ghostly form 
— mysterious, sacred, useless, 
but very beautiful — to ordinary 
people. 

For Rod it was the front gate 
to his old family computer, just 
as the secret passage in the gap 
was the back gate. 

Only relatives of the McBans, 
with eyesight which ran into the 
ultra-violet, could see the build- 
ing at normal times. 

And now it belonged to Rod 
McBan, and housed his com- 
puter. His own computer. 

He could speak to it at the 
extension which reached into 
the gap of hidden treasures. He 
talked to it, other times, at the 
talkpoint in the field, where the 
polished red-and-black metal of 
the old computer was repro- 
duced in exquisite miniature. Or 
he could come to this strange 
building, the Palace of the Gov- 
ernor of Night, and stand as the 
worshippers of Diana had once 
stood, crying, “Great is Diana 
of the Ephesians!” 

When he came in this way, he 
had the full console in front of 
him; it was automatically un- 



54 



GALAXY 



locked by his presence, just as 
his grandfather had showed him, 
three childhoods before, when 
the old McBan still had high 
hopes that Rod would turn into 
a normal Old North Australian 
boy. The grandfather, using his 
personal code in turn, unlocked 
the access controls and invited 
the computer to make its own 
foolproof recording of Rod, so 
that Roderick Frederick Ronald 
Arnold William MacArthur Mc- 
Ban CLI would be forever 
known to the mathine. no mat- 
ter what age he attained, no mat- 
ter how maimed or disguised he 
might be, no matter how sick or 
forlorn he might return to the 
machine of his forefathers. The 
old man did not even ask the 
machine how the identification 
was obtained. He trusted the 
computer. 

P od climbed the steps of the 
Palace. The columns stood 
with their ancient carving, 
bright in his second sight. He 
never quite knew how he could 
see with the ultra-violet, since 
he noticed no difference be- 
tween himself and other people 
in the matter of eyesight, except 
that he more often got headaches 
in the open on clean-cloudy days. 
At a time like this, the effect 
was spectacular. It was his time, 
his temple, his own place. In the 
reflected light from the Palace, 



he could see that many of his 
cousins must have been out to 
see the Palace during the nights. 
They too could see it, as it was 
a family inheritance to be able 
to watch the invisible temple 
which one’s friends could not 
see. 

But they did not have access; 
he alone had that. 

“Computer,” he cried, “admit 
me!” 

“Message unnecessary,” said 
the computer. “You are always 
clear to enter.” The voice was 
a male Norstrilian voice, with a 
touch of the theatrical in it. Rod 
was never quite sure that it was 
the voice of his own ancestor; 
when challenged directly as to 
whose voice it was using the ma - 
chine had told him, “Input on 
that topic has been erased in 
me. I do not know. Historical 
evidence suggests that it was 
male, contemporary with my in- 
stallation here, and past middle 
age when coded by me.” 

Rod would have felt lively 
and smart except for the feel- 
ings of awe which the Palace of 
the Governor of Night, standing 
bright and visible under the 
dark clouds of Norstrilia, had 
upon him. He wanted to say 
something lighthearted but at 
first he could only mutter: 

“Here I am.” 

“Observed and respected,” 
stated the computer-voice. “If I 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



55 



were a person I would say 'con- 
gratulations, since you are alive.’ 
As a computer I have no opinion 
on the subject. I note the fact.” 
“What do I do now?” said 
Rod. 

“Question too general,” said the 
computer. “Do you want a drink 
of water or a rest-room? I can 
tell you where those are. Do you 
wish to play chess with me? I 
shall win just as many games as 
you tell me to.” 

“Shut up, you fool!” cried 
Rod. “That’s not what I mean.” 
“Computers are fools only 
when they malfunction. I am 
not malfunctioning. The refer- 
ence to me as a fool is therefore 
nonreferential and I shall ex- 
punge it from my memory sys- 
tem. Repeat the question, 
please.” 

“What do I do with my life?” 
“You will work, you will 
marry, you will be the father of 
Rod McBan the hundred and 
fifty-second and several other 
children, you will die, your 
body will be sent into the end- 
less orbit with great honor. You 
will do this well.” 

“Suppose I break my neck this 
very night?” argued Rod. “Then 
you would be wrong, wouldn’t 
you?” 

“I would be wrong, but I still 
have the probabilities with me.” 
“What do I do about the 
Onseck?” 

56 



“Repeat.” 

Rod had to tell the story sev- 
eral times before the computer 
understood it. 

“I do not,” said the computer, 
“find myself equipped with data 
concerning this one man whom 
you so confusingly allude to as 
Houghton Syme sometimes and 
as ‘Old Hot and Simple’ at other 
times. His personal history is 
unknown to me. The odds 
against your killing him unde- 
tected are 11,713 to 1 against suc- 
cess, because too many people 
know you and know what you 
look like. I must let you solve 
you own problem concerning 
the Hon. Sec.” 

“Don’t you have any ideas?” 
“I have answers, not ideas.” 
“Give me a piece of fruit cake 
and a glass of fresh milk, then.” 
“It will cost you twelve credits 
and by walking to your cabin 
you can get these things free. 
Otherwise I will have to buy 
them from Emergency Central.” 
“I said get them!” said Rod. 
The machine whirred. Extra 
lights appeared on the console. 
“Emergency Central has author- 
ized my own use of sheltered 
supplies. You will pay for the 
replacement tomorrow.” A door 
opened. A tray slid out, with a 
luscious piece of fruit cake and 
a glass of foaming fresh milk. 

Rod sat on the steps of his 
own palace and ate. 



GALAXY 



/Conversationally, he said to 
the computer, “You must 
know what to do about Old Hot 
and Simple. It’s a terrible thing 
for me to go through the Garden 
of Death and then have a dull 
tool like that pester the life out 
of me.” 

“He cannot pester the life out 
of you. You are too strong.” 
“Recognize an idiom, you 
silly ass!” said Rod. 

The machine paused. “Idiom 
identified. Correction made. 
Apologies are herewith given 
to you, Child McBan.” 

“Another mistake. I’m not 
Child McBan any more. I’m 
Mister and Owner McBan.” 

“I will check central,” said 
the computer. There was anoth- 
er long pause as the lights 
danced. Finally the computer 
answered. “Your status is mixed. 
You are both. In an emergency 
you are already the Mister and 
Owner of the Station of Doom, 
including me. Without an emer- 
gency, you are still Child McBan 
until your trustees release you.” 
“When will they do that?” 
“Voluntary action. Human. 
Timing uncertain. In four or 
five days, it would seem. When 
they release you, the Hon. Sec. 
will have the legal right to move 
for your arrest as an incompe- 
tent and dangerous owner. From 
your point of view, it will be 
very sad.” 



“And what do you think?” 
said Rod. 

“I shall think that it is a dis- 
turbing factor. I speak the truth 
to you.” 

“And that is all?” 

“All,” said the computer. 

“You can’t stop the Hon. 
Sec.?” 

“Not without stopping every- 
body else.” 

“What do you think people 
are, anyhow? Look here, com- 
puter, you have been talking to 
people for hundreds and hun- 
dreds of years. You know our 
names. You know my family. 
Don’t you know anything about 
us? Can’t you help me? What 
do you think I am?” 

“Which question first?” said 
the computer. 

Rod angrily threw the empty 
plate and glass on the floor of 
the temple. Robot arms flicked 
out and pulled them into the 
trash bin. He stared at the old 
polished metal of the computer. 
It ought to be polished. He had 
spent hundreds of hours polish- 
ing its case, all sixty-one panels 
of it, just because the machine 
was something which he could 
love. 

“Don’t you know me? Don’t 
you know what I am?” 

“You are Rod McBan the 
hundred and fifty-first. Ana- 
tomically, you are a spinal col- 
umn with a small bone box at 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



57 



one end, the head, and with re- 
productive equipment at the 
other end. Inside the bone box 
you have a small portion of ma- 
terial which resembles stiff, 
bloody lard. With that you think 
— you think better than I do, 
even though I have over five 
hundred million synaptic con- 
nections. You are a wonderful 
object. Rod McBan. I can un- 
derstand what you are made of. 
I cannot share your human 
animal side of life.” 

“But you know I’m in danger.” 
“I know it.” 

“What did you say, a while 
back, about not being able to 
stop Old Hot and Simple with- 
out stopping everybody else too? 
Could you stop everybody else?” 
“Permission requested to cor- 
rect error. I could not stop 
everyone. If I tried to use vio- 
lence, the war computers at 
Commonwealth Defense would 
destroy me before I even started 
programming my own actions.” 
“You’re partly a war com- 
puter.” 

“Admittedly,” said the un- 
wearied, unhurried voice of the 
computer, “but the Common- 
wealth made me safe before they 
let your forefathers have me.” 
“What can you do?” 

“Rod McBan the hundred and 
fortieth told me to tell no one, 
ever.” 

“I override. Overridden.” 



“It’s not enough to do that. 
Your great 8 - grandfather has a 
warning to which you must lis- 
ten.” 

“Go ahead,” said Rod. 

nphere was a silence; Rod 
thought that the machine was 
searching through ancient ar- 
chives for a drama cube. 

Rod stood on the peristyle of 
the Palace of the Governor of 
Night and tried to see the Nors- 
trilian clouds . crawling across 
the sky near overhead. It felt 
like that kind of night; but it 
was very dark away from the 
illuminated temple porch and he 
could see nothing. 

“Do you still command?” 
asked the computer. 

“I didn’t hear any warning,” 
said Rod. 

“He spieked it from a mem- 
ory cube.” 

“Did you hier it?” 

“I was not coded to it. It was 
human-to-human, McBan family 
only.” 

“Then,” said Rod, “I override 
it.” 

“Overridden,” said the com- 
puter. It was not programmed 
to concern itself with whether 
the effect of its orders had been 
what the originator intended. 

“What can I do to stop every- 
body?” 

“You can bankrupt Norstrilia

self, and then negotiate on hu- 
man terms for anything you 
want.” 

“Oh, lord!” said Rod. “You’ve 
gone logical again, computer! 
This is one of your as-if situa- 
tions.” 

The computer voice did not 
change its tone. It could not. The 
sequence of the words held a 
reproach, however. “This is not 
an imaginary situation. I am a 
war computer, and I was design- 
ed to include economic warfare. 
If you did exactly what I told 
you to do, you could take over 
all Old North Australia by legal 
means.” 

“How long would we need? 
Two hundred years? Old Hot 
and Simple would have me in 
my grave by then.” 

The computer could not 
laugh, but it could pause. It 
paused. “I have just checked the 
time on the New Melbourne Ex- 
change. The ‘Change signal says 
they will open in seventeen min- 
utes. I will need four hours for 
your voice to say what it must. 
That means you will need four 
hours and seventeen minutes, 
give or take five minutes.” 

“What makes you think you 
can do it?” 

“I am a pure computer, ob- 
solete model. All the others have 
animal brains built into them, 
to allow for error. I do not. Fur- 
thermore, your great 12 - grandfa- 



ther hooked me into the defense 
net.” 

“Didn’t the Commonwealth 
cut you out?” 

“I am the only Computer 
which was built to tell lies. I 
lied to the Commonwealth when 
they checked on what I was get- 
ting. I am obliged to tell the 
truth only to you and to your 
designated descendants.” 

'“I know that, but what does it 
have to do with it?” 

“I predict my own space 
weather, ahead of the Common- 
wealth . The accent was not in 
the pleasant, even-toned voice; 
Rod himself supplied it. 

“You’ve tried this out?” 

“I have war-gamed it more 
than a hundred million times. 
I had nothing else to do while 
I waited for you.” 

“You never failed?” 

“I failed most of the time, 
when I first began. But I have 
not failed a 'war-game from real 
data for the last thousand years.” 
“What would happen if you 
failed now?” 

“You would be disgraced and 
bankrupt. I would be sold and 
disassembled.” 

“Is that all?” said Rod cheer- 
fully. 

“Yes,” said the computer. 

“I could stop Old Hot and 
Simple if I owned Old Earth It- 
self. Let’s go.” 

“I do not go anywhere.” 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH

“I mean, let’s start.” 

“You mean, to buy Earth, as 
we discussed?” 

“What else?” yelled Rod. 
“What else have we been talk- 
ing about?” 

“You must have some soup, 
hot soup and a tranquilizer first. 
I cannot work at optimum if I 
have a human being who gets 
excited.” 

“All right,” said Rod. 

“You must authorize me to 
buy them.” 

“I authorize you.” 

“That will be three credits.” 
“In the name of the seven 
healthy sheep, what does it mat- 
ter? How much will Earth cost?” 
“Seven thousand million mil- 
lion megacredits.” 

“Deduct three for the soup 
and the pill then,” shouted Rod, 
“if it won’t spoil your calcula- 
tions.” 

“Deducted,” said the compu- 
ter. The tray with the soup ap- 
peared, a white pill beside it. 
“Now let’s buy Earth.” 

“Drink your soup and take 
your pill first,” said the com- 
puter. 

Rod gulped down his soup, 
washing the pill down with it. 
• “Now, let’s go, cobber.” 

“Repeat after me,” said the 
computer, “I herewith mortgage 
the whole body of the said sheep 
Sweet William for the sum of 
five hundred thousand credits to 



the New Melbourne Exchange 
on the open board. .” 

Rod repeated it. 

The process of buying Earth 
had begun. 

TTe repeated it — and repeated 
it — and repeated it. 

The house became a night- 
mare of repetition. 

The computer lowered its 
voice to a low murmur, almost 
a whisper. When Rod stumbled 
in the messages, the computer 
prompted him.

Rod’s voice became a whisper, 
but the computer was sure, the 
computer was untiring, the com- 
puter answered all questions 
from the outside. 

Many times Rod and the com- 
puter both were given telepathic 
warnings built into the markets 
communications net. The com- 
puter was cut out and Rod could 
not hier them. The warnings 
went unheard.

By the time that the first 
pretty parts of silver-gray dawn 
had begun, it was done. Rod was 



dizzy with fatigue and confusion. 

“Go home and sleep,” said the 
computer. “When people find 
out what you have done with 
me, many of them will probably 
be excited and will wish to talk 
to you at great length. I suggest 
you say nothing.” 

X 

T^vrunk with fatigue, Rod stum- 
bled across his own land 
back to his cabin. 

He could not believe that any- 
thing had happened. 

If the Palace of the Governor 
of Night — 

If the computer spoke the 
truth, he was already the wealth- 
iest human being who had ever 
lived. He had gambled and won 
not a few tons of stroon or a 
planet or two, but credits 
enough to shake the Common- 
wealth to its foundation. He 
owned the Earth, on the system 
that any overdeposit could be 
called due at a certain very high 
margin. He owned planets, coun- 
tries, mines, places, prisons, po- 
lice systems, fleets, border 
guards, restaurants, pharmaceu- 
ticals, textiles, night clubs, treas- 
ures, royalties, licenses, sheep, 
land, stroon, more sheep, more 
land, more stroon. 

He had won. 

Only in Old North Australia 
could a man have done this 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



61 



witnout being besieged .. y sol- 
diers, reports, guards, police, in- 
vestigators, tax-collectors, for- 
tune-seekers, doctors, publicity 
hounds, the sick, the inquisitive, 
the compassionate, the angry 
and the affronted. 

Old North Australia kept 
calm. 

Privacy, simplicity, frugality 
— these virtues had carried 
them through the hell -world of 
Paradise VII, where the moun- 
tains ate people the volcanoes 
poisoned sheep, the delirious 
oxygen made men rave with 
bliss as they pranced to their 
own deaths. The Norstrilians 
had survived many things, in- 
cluding sickness and deformity. 
If Rod McBan had caused a fi- 
nancial crisis, there were no 
newspapers to print it, no view- 
boxes to report it, nothing to ex- 
cite the people. The Common- 
wealth authorities would pick 
the crisis out of their “in” bas- 
kets sometime after tucker and 
tea the next morning, and by 
afternoon he, his crisis and the 
computer would be in the “out” 
baskets. 

If the deal had worked, the 
whole thing would be paid off 
honestly and literally. If the 
deal had not worked out the way 
that the computer had said, his 
lands would be up for auction 
and he himself would be led 
gently away. 



But that’s what the Onseck 
was going to do to him anyway 
— Old Hot and Simple, a tiring 
dwarf-lifed man, driven by the 
boyhood hatred of many long 
years ago! 

Rod stopped for a minute. 
Around him stretched the roll- 
ing plains of his own land. Far 
ahead, to his left, there gleamed 
the glassy worm of a river-cover, 
the humped long barrel-like line 
which kept the precious water 
from evaporating. That too was 
his. 

Maybe — after the night now 
passed. 

He thought of flinging him- 
self to the ground and sleeping 
right there. He had done it be- 
fore. 

But not this morning. 

Not when he might be the 
person he might be — the man 
who made the worlds reel with 
his wealth. 

The computer had started 
easy. He could not take control 
of his property except for an 
emergency. The computer had 
made him create the emergency 
by selling his next three years 
production of santaclara at the 
market price. That was a serious 
enough emergency for any pas- 
toralist to be in deep, sure ’ 
trouble. 

From that the rest had fol- 
lowed. 

Rod sat down. 



62 



GALAXY 



He was not trying to remem- 
ber. The remembering was 
crowding into his mind. He 
wanted just to get his breath, to 
get on home, to sleep. 

A tree was near him, with a 
thermostatically controlled 
cover which domed it in when- 
ever the winds were too strong 
or too dry, and an underground 
sprinkler which kept it alive 
when surface moisture was not 
sufficient. It was one of the old 
MacArthur extravagances which 
his McBan ancestor had inherit- 
ed and had added to the Station 
of Doom. It was a modified 
Earth oak, very big, a full thir- 
teen meters high. Rod was proud 
of it though he did not like it 
much, but he had relatives who 
were obsessed by it and would 
make a three-hour ride just to 
sit in the shade — dim and dif- 
fuse as it was — of a genuine 
tree from Earth. 

When he looked at the tree, 
a violent noise assailed him. 

Mad frantic laughter — 
Laughter beyond all jokes — 
Laughter sick, wild, drunk, 
dizzy! 

He started to be angry and 
was then puzzled. Who could be 
laughing at him already? As a 
matter of nearer fact, who could 
be trespassing on his land? Any- 
how, what was there to laugh 
about? 



(All Norstrilians knew that 
humor was “pleasurable cor- 
rigible malfunction.” It was in 
the Book of Rhetoric which 
their Appointed Relatives had 
to get them through if they were 
even to qualify for the tests of 
the Garden of Death since 
there were no schools, no classes, 
no teachers, no libraries except 
for private ones. There were just 
the seven liberal arts, the. six 
practical sciences, and the five 
collections of police and defense 
studies. Specialists were trained 
off-world, but they were trained 
only from among the survivors 
of the Garden, and nobody 
could get as far as the Garden 
unless the sponsors, who staked 
their lives along with that of the 
student — so far as the question 
of aptness was concerned — • 
guaranteed that the entrant 
knew the eighteen kinds of 
Nostrilian Knowledge. The 
Book of Rhetoric came second, 
right after the Book of Sheep 
and Numbers, so that all Nors- 
trilians knew why they laughed 
and what there was to laugh 
about.) 

But this laughter! Aagh, who 
could it be? 

A sick man? Impossible. Hos- 
tile hallucinations brought on 
by the Hon. Sec. in his own on- 
seckish way with unusual tele- 
pathic powers? Scarcely. 

Rod began to laugh himself 

63 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



as he realized what the sound 
must be. 

It was something rare and 
beautiful, a kookaburra bird, 
the same kind of bird which had 
laughed in Original Australia on 
Old Old Earth. A very few had 
reached this new planet. They 
had not multiplied well, even 
though the Norstrilians respect- 
ed them and loved them and 
wished them well. 

Good luck came with their 
wild birdish laughter. A man 
could feel he had a fine day 
ahead. Lucky in love, thumb in 
an enemy’s eye, new ale in the 
fridge or a ruddy good chance 
on the market. 

Laugh, bird, laugh! thought 
Rod. 

Perhaps the bird understood 
him. The laughter increased and 
reached maniac, hilarious pro- 
portions. The bird sounded as 
though it was watching the most 
comical bird-comedy which any 
bird-audience had ever been in- 
vited to, as though the bird- 
jokes were side-splitting con- 
vulsive gut popping, unbeliev- 
able, racy, daring and over- 
whelming. The bird-laughter be- 
came hysterical and a note of 
fear, of warning crept in. 

Rod stepped toward the tree. 

In all this time he had not 
seen the kookaburra. 

He squinted into the tree, 
peering against the brighter side 



of the sky which showed the 
morning had arrived well. 

To him, the tree was blinding- 
ly green, since it kept most of 
its earth color, not turning beige 
or gray as the earth grasses had 
done when they had been adapt- 
ed and planted in Norstrilian 
soil. 

To be sure, the bird was there, 
a tiny slender laughing impu- 
dent shape. 

Suddenly the bird cawed: this 
was no laugh. 

Startled, Rod stepped back 
and started to look around for 
danger. 

The step saved his life. 

The sky whistled at him, the 
wind hit him, a dark shape shot 
past him with the speed of 
projectile and was gone. As it 
leveled out just above the 
ground. Rod saw what it was. 

A mad sparrow. 

Qparrows had reached twenty 
^ kilos’ weight, with straight 
sword-like beaks almost a meter 
in length. Most of the time the 
Commonwealth left them alone. 
They performed a useful func- 
tion; they preyed on the giant 
lice, the size of footballs, which 
had grown with the sick sheep. 
But now and then one of the 
birds went mad and attacked 
people. 

Rod turned, watching the 
sparrow as it walked around. 



64 



GALAXY 



about a hundred meters away. 

Some mad sparrows, it was 
rumored, were not mad at all, 
but were tame sparrows sent on 
death by Norstrilian men whose 
minds had been twisted into 
crime. This was rare, but pos- 
sible. 

Could the Onseck already be 
attacking? 

Rod slapped his belt for weap- 
ons as the sparrow took to the 
air again, flapping upward with 
the pretense of innocence. He 
had nothing except his belt- 
light and a canister. This would 
not hold out long unless some- 
body came along. What could a 
tired man do, using bare hands, 
against a sword which burst 
through the air with a mono- 
maniac birdbrain behind it? 

Rod braced himself for the 
bird’s next power-dive, holding 
the canister like a shield. 

The canister was not much of 
a shield. 

Down came the bird, preceded 
by the whistle of air against its 
head and beak. Rod watched for 
the eyes and when he saw them, 
he jumped. 

The dust roared up as the 
giant sparrow twisted its spear- 
like beak out of the line of the 
ground, opened its wings, beat 
the air against gravity, caught it- 
self centimeters from the surface 
and flapped away with powerful 
strokes; Rod stood and watched 



quietly, glad that he had es- 
caped. 

Rain was so rare in the Nors- 
trilian plains that he did not 
see how he could have gotten 
wet. He glanced down idly. 

Blood it was, and his own. 

The kill-bird had missed him 
with its beak but had touched 
him with the razor-like wing- 
feathers, which had mutated in- 
to weapons; both the rhachis 
and the vane in the large feath- 
ers were tremendously rein- 
forced, with the development of 
a bitterly sharp hyporhachis in 
the case of the wingtips. The 
bird had cut him so fast he had 
not felt or noticed it. 

Like any good Norstrilian, he 
thought in terms of first aid. 

The flow of blood was not 
very rapid. Should he try to tie 
up his arm first or to hide from 
the next diving attack? 

The bird answered his ques- 
tion for him. 

The ominous whistle sounded 
again. 

Rod flung himself along the 
ground, trying to get to the base 
of the tree trunk, where the bird 
could not dive on him. 

The bird, making a serious 
mental mistake, thought it had 
disabled him. With a flutter of 
wings it landed calmly, stood on 
its feet and cocked its head to 
look him over. When the bird 
moved its head, the sword-beak 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



65 



gleamed evilly in the weak sun- 
shine. 

Rod reached the tree and 
started to lift himself up by 
seizing the trunk. 

Doing this, he almost lost his 
life. He had forgotten how fast 
the sparrows could run on the 
ground. 

In one second, the bird was 
standing, comical and evil, 
studying him with its sharp, 
bright eyes; the next second, the 
knife-beak was into him, just 
below the bony part of the 
shoulder. 

He felt the eerie wet pull of 
the beak being drawn out of his 
body, the ache in his surprised 
flesh which would precede the 
griping pain. He hit at the bird 
with his belt-light. He missed. 

T)y now he was weakened from 
^ * his two wounds. The arm 
was still dripping blood steadily 
and he felt his shorts get wet as 
blood poured from his shoulder. 

The bird, backing off, was 
again studying him by cocking 
its head. Rod tried to guess his 
chances, One square blow from 
his hand, and the bird was dead. 
The bird had thought him dis- 
abled — but now he really was 
partially disabled. 

If his blow did not land, score 
one mister for the bird, mark a 
credit for the Hon. Sec., give 
Old Hot and Simple the victory! 

66 



By now Rod had not the least 
doubt that Houghton Syme was 
behind the attack. 

The bird rushed. 

Rod forgot to fight the way 
he had planned. 

He kicked instead and caught 
the bird right in its heavy, coarse 
body. 

It felt like a very big football 
filled with sand. 

The kick hurt his foot but the 
bird was flung a good six or 
seven meters away. Rod rushed 
behind the tree and looked back 
at the bird. The blood was puls- 
ing fast out of his shoulder. 

The kill-bird had gotten to 
his feet and was walking firmly 
and securely around the tree. 
One of the wings trailed a little; 
the kick seemed to have hurt a 
wing, but not the legs or that 
horribly strong neck. 

Once again the bird cocked 
its comical head. It was his own 
blood which dripped from the 
long beak, now red, which had 
gleamed silver gray at the be- 
ginning of the fight. Rod wished 
he had studied more about these 
birds. He had never been this 
close to a mutated sparrow be- 
fore and he had no idea of how 
to fight one. All he had known 
was that they attacked people 
on very rare occasions and that 
sometimes the people died in 
the encounters. 

He tried to spiek, to let out a 

GALAXY 



scream which would bring the 
neighborhood and the police fly- 
ing and running toward him. 
He found he had no telepathy at 
all, not when he had to concen- 
trate his whole mind and atten- 
tion on the bird, knowing that 
its very next move could bring 
him irretrievable death. This 
was no temporary death with 
the rescue squads nearby. There 
was no one in the neighborhood, 
no one at all, except for the ex- 
cited and sympathetic kooka- 
burras haha-ing madly in the 
above. 

He shouted at the bird, hoping 
to frighten it. 

The kill -bird paid him no 
more attention than if it had 
been a deaf reptile. 

The foolish head tipped this 
way and that. The little bright 
eyes watched him. The red 
sword-beak, rapidly turning 
brown in the dry air, probed ab- 
stract dimensions for a way to 
his brain or heart. Rod took time 
to wonder how the bird solved 
its problems in solid geometry — 
movement of the beak, the 
the angle of approach, the line of 
thrust, the movement of the 
beak, the weight and direction of 
the fleeing object, himself. 

He jumped back a few centi- 
meters, intending to look at the 
bird from the other side of the 
tree-trunk. 

There was a hiss in the air, 



like the helpless hiss of a gentle 
little snake. 

The bird, when he saw it, 
looked odd: suddenly it seemed 
to have two beaks. 

Rod marveled. 

He did not really understand 
what was happening until the 
bird leaned over suddenly, fell 
on its side, and lay — plainly 
dead — on the dry cool ground. 
The eyes were still open but 
they looked blank. The bird’s 
body twitched a little. The wings 
opened out in a dying spasm. 
One of the wings almost struck 
the trunk of the tree, but the 
tree-guarding device raised a 
plastic shaft to ward off the 
blow; a pity the device had not 
been designed as a people-guard 
as well. 

Only then did Rod see that 
the second “beak” was no beak 
at all, but a javelin, its point 
biting cleanly and tightly right 
through the bird’s skull into its 
brain. 

No wonder the bird had drop- 
ped dead quickly! 

XI 

\ s Rod looked around to see 
who his rescuer might be, 
the ground rose up and struck 
him. 

He had fallen. 

The loss of blood was faster 
than he had allowed for. 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



67 



He looked around, almost like 
a child in his bewilderment and 
dizziness. There was a shimmer 
of turquoise and the girl Lavinia 
was standing over him. She had 
a medical pack open and was 
spraying his wounds with cryp- 
toderm — the living bandage 
which was so expensive that 
only on Norstrilia, the exporter 
of stroon, could it be carried 
around in emergency cans. 

“Keep quiet,” she said with 
her voice. “Keep quiet, Rod. 
We’ve got to stop the blood first 
of all. Lands of mercy, but 
you’re a crashing mess!” 

“Who . ?” said Rod weakly. 

“The Hon. Sec.,” said she im- 
mediately. 

“You know?” he asked, 
amazed that she should under- 
stand everything so very quick- 
ly indeed. 

“Don’t talk, and I’ll tell you.” 
She had taken her field-knife 
and was cutting the sticky shirt 
off him, so that she could lift 
the bottle and spray right into 
the wound. “I just suspected 
you were in trouble, when Bill 
rode by the house and said some 
thing crazy, that you had bought 
half the galaxy by gambling all 
night with a crazy machine 
which paid off. I did not know 
where you were, but I thought 
that you might be in that old 
temple of yours that the rest of 
them can’t see. I didn’t know 



what kind of danger to look for, 
so I brought this.” She slapped 
her hip. Rod’s eyes widened. 
She had stolen her father’s one- 
fciloton grenade, which was to 
be removed from its rack only 
in the event of off -world attack. 
She answered his question be- 
fore he asked her. “It’s all right. 
I made a dummy to take its place 
before I touched it. Then, as I 
took it out, the Defense moni- 
tor came on and I just explained 
that I had hit it with my new 
broom which was longer than 
usual. Do you think I would let 
Old Hot and Simple kill you, 
Rod, without a fight from me? 
I’m your cousin, your kith and 
kin. As a matter of fact, I’m 
number twelve after you when 
it comes to inheriting Doom and 
all the wonderful things there 
are on this station.” 

Rod said, “Give me water.” 
He suspected she was chattering 
to keep his attention off what 
she was doing to his shoulder 
and arm. The arm glowed once 
when she sprayed the crypto- 
derm on it; then it settled down 
to more aching. The shoulder 
had exploded from time to time 
as she probed it. She had thrust 
a diagnostic needle into it and 
was reading the tiny bright pic- 
ture on the end of the needle. 
He knew it had both analgesics 
and antiseptics as well as an 
ultra-miniaturized X-ray, but he 



68 



GALAXY 



did not think that anyone would 
be willing to use it unaided in 
the field. 

She answered this question, 
too, before he asked it. She was 
a very perceptive girl. 

“We don’t know what the 
Onseck is going to do next. He 
may have corrupted people as 
well as animals, I don’t dare 
call for help, not until you have 
your friends around you. Cer- 
tainly not, if you have bought 
half the worlds.” 

od dragged out the words. 

He seemed short of breath. 
“How did you know it was 
him?” 

“I saw his face. I hiered it 
when I looked in the bird’s own 
brain. I could see Houghton 
Syme, talking to the bird in 
some kind of odd way, and I 
could see your dead body 
through the bird’s eyes, and I 
could feel a big wave of love 
and approval, happiness and re- 
ward, going through the bird 
when the job was to have been 
finished. I think that man is 
evil. Evil!” 

“You know him, yourself?” 

‘What girl around here 
doesn’t? He’s a nasty man. He 
had a boyhood that was all 
rotten from the time that he 
realized he was a short-lifer. He 
has never gotten over it. Some 
people are sorry for him and 



don’t mind his getting the job 
of Hon. Sec. If I’d had my way, 
I’d have sent him to the giggle 
room long ago!” Lavinia’s face 
was set in prudish hate, an ex- 
pression so unlike herself, who 
usually was bright and gay, that 
Rod wondered what deep bitter- 
ness might have been stirred 
within her. 

“Why do you hate him?” 

“For what he did.” 

“What did he do?” 

“He looked at me,” she said, 
“he looked at me in a way that 
no girl can like. And then he 
crawled all over my mind, try- 
ing to show me all the silly, 
dirty, useless things he wanted 
to do.” 

“But he didn’t really do any- 
thing — -” said Rod. 

“Yes, he did,” she snapped. 
“Not with his hands. I could 
have reported him. I would 
have. It’s what he did with his 
mind, the things he spieked to 

__ _ fj 

me. 

“You can report those too,” 
said Rod, very tired of talking 
but nevertheless mysteriously 
elated to discover that he was 
not the only enemy which the 
Onseck had made. 

“Not what he did, I couldn’t,” 
said Lavinia, her face set in 
anger but dissolving into grief. 
Grief was tenderer, softer, but 
deeper and more real than 
anger. For the first time Rod 




THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH

sensed a feeling of concern 
about Lavinia. What might be 
wrong with her? 

She looked past him and 
spoke to the open fields and the 
big dead bird. “Houghton Syme 
was the worst man I’ve ever 
known. I hope he dies. He never 
got over that rotten boyhood of 
his. The old sick boy is the en- 
emy of the man. We’ll never 
know what he might have been. 
And if you hadn’t been so 
wrapped up in your own trou- 
bles. mister Rod to the hundred 
and fifty first, you’d have re- 
membered who I am.” 

“Who are you?” said Rod, na- 
turally. 

“I’m the Father’s Daughter.” 

“So what?” said Rod. “All 
girls are.” 

“Then you never have found 
out about me. I’m the Father’s 
Daughter from The Father’s 
Daughter’s Song.” 

“Never heard it.” 

She looked at him and her 
eyes were close to tears. “Listen, 
then, and I’ll sing it to you now. 
And it’s true, true, true. 

You do not know what the world Is 
like 

And I hope that you never will. 

My heart was once much full of hope. 

But now It Is very still 
My wife went mad. 

She was my love and wore my ring 

When both of us were young. 

She bore my babes, but then, but 
then . 

And now there isn’t anything 

My wife went mad. 



Now she lives In another place. 

Half sick, half well, and never young. 

I am her dread, who was her love. 

Each of us has another face. 

My wife went mad. 

You do not know what the world Is 
like. 

War is never the worst of it. 

The stars within your eyes can drop. 

The lightning in your brain can strike. 
My wife went mad. 

And I see you have heard it, 
too,” she sighed. “Just as my fa- 
ther wrote it. About my mother. 
My own mother.” 

“Oh, Lavinia,” said Rod, “I’m 
sorry. I never thought it was 
you. And you my own cousin 
only three or four times re- 
moved. But Lavinia, there’s 
something wrong. How can your 
mother be mad if she was look- 
ing fine at my house last week?” 

((Qhe was never mad,” said 

^ Lavina. “My father was. 
He made up that cruel song 
about my mother so that the 
neighbors complained. He had 
his choice of the Giggle Room 
to die in, or the sickplace, to be 
immortal and insane. He’s there 
now. And the Onseck, the On- 
seck threatened to bring him 
back to our neighborhood if I 
didn’t do what he asked. Do you 
think I could forgive that? 
Ever? After people have sung 
that hateful song at me ever 
since I was a baby? Do you won- 
der that I know it myself?” 

Rod- nodded. Lavinia’s trou- 
bles impressed him, but he had 



70 



GALAXY 



troubles of his own. The sun was 
never hot on Norstrilia, but he 
suddenly felt thirsty and hot 
He wanted to sleep but he won- 
dered about the dangers which 
surrounded him. 

She knelt beside him. 

“Close your eyes a bit, Rod. 
I will spiek very quietly and 
maybe nobody will notice it ex- 
cept your station hands, Bill and 
Hopper. When they come we’ll 
hide out for the day and tonight 
we can go back to your com- 
puter and hide. I’ll tell them to 
bring food.” 

She hesitated, “And, Rod?” 

“Yes?” he said. 

“Forgive me.” 

“For what?” 

“For my troubles,” she said 
contritely. 

“Now, you have more trou- 
bles. Me,” he said. “Let’s not 
blame ourselves, but for sheeps’ 
sake, girl, let me sleep.” 

He drifted off to sleep as she 
sat beside him, whistling a loud 
clear tune with long long notes 
which never added up. He knew 
some people, usually women, 
did that when they tried to con- 
centrate on their telepathic 
spieking. 

Once he glanced up at her be- 
fore he finally slept. He noticed 
that her eyes were a deep, 
strange blue. Like the mad, wild, 
faraway skies of Old Earth It- 
self. 



He slept, and in his sleep he 
knew that he was being carried. 

The hands which carried him 
felt friendly, though, and he 
curled himself back into deep, 
deeper dreamless sleep. 

XII 

"I T 7"hen Rod finally awakened, 
” ' it was to feel his shoulder 
tightly bound and his arm throb- 
bing. He had fought waking up, 
because the pain had increased 
as his mind moved toward con- 
sciousness, but the pain and the 
murmur of voices caused him 
to come all the way to the hard, 
bright surface of consciousness. 

The murmur of voices? 

There was no place on all Old 
North Australia where voices 
murmured. People sat around 
and spieked to each other and 
answered without the clatter of 
vocal cords. Telepathy made for 
brilliant and quick conversation, 
the participants darting their 
thoughts this way and that, soar- 
ing with their shields so . as to 
produce the effect of a confident 
whisper. 

But here there were voices. 
Many voices. Not possible! 

And the smell was wrong. The 
air was wet — luxuriously, ex- 
travagantly wet, like a miser try- 
ing to catch a rainstorm! 

It was almost like the van of 
the Garden of Death. 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



71 



Just as he woke, he recognized 
Lavinia singing an odd little 
aong. It was one which Rod 
knew, because it had a sharp, 
catchy, poignant little melody 
to it which sounded like noth- 
ing on his world. She was sing- 
ing, and it sounded like one of 
the weird sadnesses which his 
people had brought from their 
horrible group experience on 
the abandoned planet of Para- 
dise VII: 

Is there anybody here or Is every- 
body dead at the grey green blue 
black lake? 

The sky was blue and now It Is red 
over old tall green brown trees. 

The house was big but now It looks 
small at the grey green blue 
black lake. 

And the girl that I knew Isn’t there 
any more at the old flat dark 
tom place. 

His eyes opened. It was indeed 
Lavinia whom he saw at the 
edge of vision. This was no 
house. It was a box, a hospital, 
a prison, a ship, a cave or a fort. 
The furnishings were machined 
and luxurious. The light was 
artificial and almost the color 
of peaches. A strange hum in 
the background sounded like 
alien engines dispensing power 
for' purposes which Norstrilian 
law never permitted to private 
persons. The Lord Redlady lean- 
ed over Rod; the fantastic man 
broke into song himself, chant- 
ing — 



Light a lantern. 

Light a lantern. 

Light a lantern. 

Here we crane. 

When he saw the obvious 
signs of Rod’s perplexity, he 
burst into a laugh, 

“That’s the oldest song you 
ever heard, my boy. It’s pre- 
space. It used to be called ‘ge- 
neral quarters’ where ships like 
big iron houses floated on the 
waters of earth and fought each 
other. We’ve been waiting for 
you to wake up.” 

“Water,” said Rod. “please 
give me water. Why are you 
talking?” 

“Water!” cried the Lord Red- 
lady to someone behind him. 
His sharp, thin face was alight 
with excitement as he turned 
back to Rod. “And we’re talk- 
ing because I have my buzzer on. 
If people want to talk to each 
other, they jolly well better use 
their voices in this ship.” 

“Ship?” said Rod, reaching 
for the mug of cold water which 
a hand had reached out to him. 

“This is my ship, mister and 
owner Rod McBan to the hun- 
dred and fifty-first! An earth 
ship. I pulled it out of orbit and 
grounded it with the permission 
of the Commonwealth. They 
don’t know you’re on it, yet. 
They can’t find out right now, 
because my Humanoid-Robot 
Brainwave Dephasing Device is 
on. Nobody can think in or out 



72 



GALAXY 



through that, and anybody who 
tries telepathy on this boat is 
going to get himself a headache.” 

“Why you?” said Rod. ‘What 
for?” 

“In due time,” said the Lord 
Redlady. “Let me introduce you 
first. You know these people.” 
He waved at a group. 

Lavinia sat with his hands, 
Bill and Hopper, with his work- 
woman Eleanor, with his Aunt 
Doris. They looked odd, sitting 
on the low, soft, luxurious earth 
furniture. They were all sipping 
some earth drink of a color 
which Rod had never seen before. 
Their expressions were diverse. 
Bill looked truculent, Hopper 
looked greedy, Aunt Doris look- 
ed utterly embarrassed and La- 
vinia looked as though she were 
enjoying herself. 

“And then here. .” said the 
Lord Redlady. 

'“T'he man he pointed to might 
-*-not have been a man. He was 
the Norstrilian type all right. 
But he was a giant, of the kind 
which were always killed in the 
Garden of Death. 

“At your service,” said the 
giant, who was almost three 
meters tall and who had to 
watch his head, lest it hit the 
ceiling. “I am Donald Dumfrie 
Hordern Anthony Garwood 
Gaines Wentworth to the four- 
teenth generation, mister and 



owner McBan. A military sur- 
geon, at your service, sir!” 

“But this is private. Surgeons 
aren’t allowed to work for any- 
body but government.” 

“I am on loan to the Earth 
Government,” said Wentworth, 
the giant, his face in a broad 
grin. 

“And I,” said the Lord Red- 
lady, “am both the Instrumen- 
tality and the Earth Govern- 
ment for diplomatic purposes. I 
borrowed him. He’s under Earth 
rules. You will be well in two 
or three hours.” 

The doctor, Wentworth, look- 
ed at his hand as though he saw 
a chronograph there, 

“Two hours and seventeen 
minutes more.” 

“Let it be,” said the Lord 
Redlady. “Here’s our last guest.” 
A short angry man stood up 
and came over. He glared out 
at Rod and held forth an angry 
hand. “John Fisher to the hun- 
dreth. You know me.” 

“Do I?” said Rod, not impo- 
litely. He was just dazed. 

“Station of The Good Fresh 
Joey,” said Fisher. 

“I haven’t been there,” said 
Rod, “but I’ve heard of it.” 
“You needn’t have,” snapped 
the angry Fisher. “I met you at 
your grandfather’s.” 

“Oh, yes, mister and owner 
Fisher,” said Rod, not really re- 
membering anything at all, but 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



73 



wondering why the short red- 
faced man was so angry with 
him. 

“You don’t know who I am?” 
said Fisher. 

“Silly games!” thought Rod. 
He said nothing but smiled dim- 
ly. Hunger began to stir inside 
him. 

“Commonwealth Financial 
Secretary, that’s me,” said Fish- 
er. “I handle the books and the 
credits for the government.” 

“Wonderful work,” said Rod 
“I’m sure it’s complicated. Could 
I have something to eat?” 

The Lord Redlady interrupt- 
ed: “Would you like French 

pheasant with Chinesian sauce 
steeped in the thieves’ wine 
from Viola Siderea? It would 
only cost you six thousand tons 
of refined gold, orbited near 
earth, if I ordered it sent to you 
by special courier.” 

TT'or some inexplicable reason 
■*- the entire room howled with 
laughter. 

The men put their glasses 
down so as not to spill them. 
Hopper seized the opportunity 
to refill his own glass. Aunt 
Doris looked hilarious and se- 
cretly proud, as though she her- 
self had laid a diamond egg or 
done some equal marvel. Only 
Lavinia, though laughing, man- 
aged to look sympathetically at 
Rod to make sure that he did 



not feel mocked. The Lord Red- 
lady laughed as loudly as the 
rest, and even the short, angry 
John Fisher allowed himself a 
wan smile, while holding out his 
hand for a refill on his drink. 
An animal, a little one which 
looked very much like an ex- 
tremely small person, lifted up 
the bottle and filled his glass 
for him; Rod suspected that it 
was a “monkey” from Old Old 
Earth, from the stories he had 
heard. 

Rod didn’t even say, “What’s 
the joke?” though he realized 
plainly that he was himself in 
the middle of it. He just smiled 
weakly back at them, feeling the 
hunger grow within him. 

“My robot is cooking you an 
Earth dish. French toast with 
maple syrup. You could live ten 
thousand years on this planet 
and never get it. Rod, don’t you 
know why we’re laughing? 
Don’t you know what you’ve 
done?” 

“The Onseck tried to kill me, 
I think,” said Rod. 

Lavinia clapped her hand to 
her mouth, but it was too late. 

“So that’s who it was,” said 
the doctor, Wentworth, with a 
voice as gigantic as himself. 

“But you wouldn’t laugh at 
me for that — ” Rod started to 
say. Then he stopped himself. 

An awufl thought had come. 

“You mean, it really worked? 



74 



GALAXY 



That stuff with my family’s old 
computer?” 

The laughter broke out again. 
It was kind laughter, but it was 
always the laughter of a peasant 
people, driven by boredom, who 
greet the unfamiliar with attack 
or with laughter. 

“You did it,” said Hopper. 
“You’ve bought a billion 
worlds.” 

John Fisher snapped at him, 
“Let’s not exaggerate. He’s 
gotten about one point six stroon 
years. You couldn’t buy any bil- 
lion worlds for that. In the first 
place, there aren’t a billion set- 
tled worlds, not even a million. 
In the second place, there aren’t 
many worlds for sale. I doubt 
that he could buy thirty or 
forty.” 

The little animal, prompted 
by some imperceptible sign from 
the Lord Redlady, went out of 
the room and returned with a 
tray. The odor from the tray 
made all the people in the room 
sniff appreciatively. The food 
was unfamiliar, but it combined 
pungency and sweetness. The 
monkey fitted the tray into an 
artfully concealed slot at the 
head of Rod’s couch, took off 
an imaginary monkey cap, sa- 
luted and went back to his bas- 
ket behind the Lord Redlady’s 
chair. 

The Lord Redlady nodded. 
“Eat boy, it’s on me.” 



Rod sat up. His shirt was still 
blood-caked and he realized that 
it was almost worn out. 

“That’s an odd sight, I must 
say,” said the huge doctor Went- 
worth. “There’s the richest man 
in many worlds, and he hasn’t 
the price of a new pair of over- 
alls.” 

“What’s odd about that? 
We’ve always charged an import 
fee of twenty million per cent 
of the orbit price of goods,” 
snapped angry John Fisher. 
“Have you ever realized what 
other people have swung into 
orbit around our sun, just wait- 
ing for us to change our minds 
so they could sell us half the 
rubbish in the universe? This 
world would be knee-deep in 
junk if we ever dropped our tar- 
iff. I’m surprised at you, doctor, 
forgetting the fundamental rules 
of Old North Australia!” 

“He’s not complaining,” said 
Aunt Doris, whom the drink had 
made loquacious. “He’s just 
thinking. We all think.” 

“Of course we all think. Or 
daydream. Some of us leave and 
go off-planet to be rich people 
on other worlds. A few of us 
even manage to get back here 
on severe probation when we 
realize what the off worlds are 
like. I’m just saying,” said the 
doctor, “that Rod’s situation 
would be very funny to every- 
body except us Norstrilians. 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



75 



We’re all rich with the stroon 
imports, but we kept ourselves 
poor in order to survive.” 

"Who’s poor?” snapped the 
fieldhand Hopper, apparently 
touched at a sensitive point. “I 
can match you with megacred- 
its, doc, any time you care to 
gamble. Or I’ll meet you with 
throwing knives, if you want 
them better. I’m as good as the 
next man!” 

"That’s exactly what I mean,” 
said John Fisher. “Hopper here 
can argue with anybody on the 
planet. We’re still equals. We’re 
still free. We’re not the victims 
of our own wealth — that’s 
Norstrilia for you!” 

Rod looked up from his food 
and said, “Mister and owner 
secretary Fisher, you talk aw- 
fully well for somebody who is 
not a freak like me. How do you 
do it?” 

T?isher started looking angry 
-*• again, though he was not 
really angry: “Do you think that 
financial records can be dictated 
telepathically? I’m spending 
centuries out of my life, just dic- 
tating into my blasted micro- 
phone. Yesterday I spent most of 
the day dictating the mess 
which you have made of the 
Commonwealth’s money for the 
next eight years. And you know 
what I’m going to do at the next 
meeting of the council?” 



“What?” said Rod. 

“I’m going to move the con- 
demnation of that computer of 
yours. It’s too good to be in pri- 
vate hands.” 

“You can’t do that!” shrieked 
Aunt Doris, somewhat mellowed 
by the earth beverage she was 
drinking. “It’s MacArthur and 
McBan family property!” 

“You can keep the temple,” 
said Fisher with a snort. “But 
no bloody family is going to out- 
guess the whole planet again. Do 
you know that boy sitting there 
has four megacredits on Earth 
at this moment?” 

Bill hiccupped, “I got more 
than that myself.” 

Fisher snarled at him, “On 
earth? FOE money?” 

A silence hit the room. 

“FOE money. Four mega- 
credits? He can buy Old Aus- 
tralia and ship it out here to 
us.” Bill sobered fast. 

Said Lavinia mildly, “What’s 
foe money?” 

“Do you know, mister and 
owner McBan?” said Fisher, in 
a peremptory tone. “You had 
better know, because you have 
more of it than any man has 
ever had before.” 

“I don’t want to talk about 
money,” said Rod. “I want to 
find out what the Onseck is up 
to.” 

“Don’t worry about him!” 
laughed the Lord Redlady, 



76 



GALAXY 



prancing to his feet and point- 
ing at himself with a dramatic 
forefinger. “As the representa- 
tive of Earth, I filed six hundred 
and eighty-five lawsuits against 
him simultaneously, in the name 
of your Earth debtors, who fear 
that some harm might befall 
you.” 

“Do they really?” said Rod. 
“Already?” 

“Of course not. All they know 
is your name and the fact that 
you bought them out. But they 
would worry if they did know, 
so as your agent I tied up the 
Hon. Sec. Houghton Syme with 
more law cases than this planet 
has ever seen before.” 

The big doctor chuckled. 
“Dashed clever of you, my lord 
and mister! You know us Nors- 
trilians pretty well, I must say. 
If we charge a man with mur- 
der, we’re so freedom-minded 
that he has time to commit a 
few more before being tried for 
the first one. But civil suits! Hot 
sheep! He’ll never get out of 
those, as long as he lives.” 

“Is he onsecking any more?” 
said Rod. 

“What do you mean?” asked 
Fisher. 

“Does he still have his job — 
Onseck?” 

“Oh, yes,” said Fisher. “But 
we put him on two hundred 
years’ leave and he had only 
about a hundred and twenty 



years to live, poor fellow. Most 
of that time he will be defend- 
ing himself in civil suits.” 

Rod finally exhaled. He had 
finished the food. The small 
polished room with its ma- 
chined elegance, the wet air, the 
bray of voices all over the place 
— these made him feel dream- 
like. Here grown men were 
standing, talking as though he 
really did own Old Earth. They 
were concerned with his affairs, 
not because he was Roderick 
Frederick Ronald Arnold Wil- 
liam MacArthur McBan the 
hundred- and-fifty-first, but be- 
cause he was Rod, a boy among 
them who had stumbled upon 
danger and fortune. 

He looked around the room. 
The conversations had acciden- 
tally stopped. They were look- 
ing at him, and he saw in their 
faces something which he had 
seen before. What was it? It was 
not love. It was a rapt attentive- 
ness, combined with a sort of 
pleasurable and indulgent inter- 
est. He then realized what the 
looks signified. They were giving 
him the adoration which they 
usually reserved only for cricket 
players, tennis players, and 
great track performers — like 
that fabulous Hopkins Harvey 
fellow who had gone offworld 
and won a wrestling match with 
a “heavy man” from Wereld 
Schemering. He was not just 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



77 



Rod any more. He was their boy. 

As their boy, he smiled at 
them vaguely and felt like cry- 
ing. 

XIII 

'Tphe breathlessness broke when 
the large doctor, mister and 
owner Wentworth threw in a 
stark comment: 

“Time to tell him, mister and 
owner Fisher. He won’t have his 
property long if we don’t get 
moving. No, nor his life either.” 
Lavinia jumped up and cried 
out, “You can’t kill Rod — ” 
Doctor Wentworth stopped 
her. “Sit down. We’re not going 
to kill him. And you there, stop 
acting foolish! We’re his friends 
here.” 

Rod followed the line of the 
doctor’s glance and saw that 
Hopper had snaked his hand 
back to the big knife he wore 
in his belt. He was getting ready 
to fight anyone who attacked 
Rod. 

“Sit, sit down, all of you, 
please!” said the Lord Redlady, 
speaking somewhat fussily with 
his singsong Earth accent. “I’m 
host here. Nobody’s killing Rod 
tonight. Doctor, you take my 
table. Sit down yourself. You 
will stop threatening my ceiling 
or your head. You, ma’am and 
owner,” said he to Aunt Doris, 
“move over there to that other 



chair. Now we can all see the 
doctor.” 

“Can’t we wait?” asked Rod. 
“I need to sleep. Are you going 
to ask me to make decisions 
now? I’m not up to decisions, 
not after what I’ve just been 
through. All night with the com- 
puter. The long walk. The bird 
from the Onseck — ” 

“You’ll have no decisions to 
make if you don’t make them 
tonight,” said the doctor firmly 
and pleasantly. “You’ll be a dead 
man.” 

“Who’s going to kill me?” 
asked. Rod. 

“Anybody who wants money. 
Or who wants power. Or who 
would like unlimited life. Or 
who needs these things to get 
something else. Revenge. A 
woman. An obsession. A drug. 
You’re not just a person now, 
Rod. You’re Norstrilia incar- 
nate. You’re Mr. Money him- 
self! Don’t ask who’d kill you. 
Ask who wouldn’t. Us, I think. 
But don’t tempt us.” 

“How much money have I 
got?” said Rod. 

Angry John Fisher cut in: 
“So much that the computers 
are clotted up, just counting it. 
About one and a half stroon 
years. Perhaps three hundred 
years of Old Earth’s total in- 
come. You sent more Instant 
Messages last night than the 
Commonwealth government it- 



78 



GALAXY 



self has sent in the last twelve 
years. Those messages are ex- 
pensive. One kilocredit each, 
paid in foe money.” 

“I asked a long time ago what 
this ‘foe money’ was,” said Lavi- 
nia, “and nobody has got around 
to telling me.” 

'~|~'he Lord Redlady took the 
middle of the floor. He stood 
there with a stance which none 
of the Old North Australians* 
had ever seen before. It was ac- 
tually the posture of a master of 
ceremonies opening the evening 
at a large night club, but to peo- 
ple who had never seen 
those particular gestures, his 
movements were eerie, self-ex- 
planatory and queerly beautiful. 

“Ladies and gentlemen,” he 
said, using a phrase which most 
of them had only heard in 
books, “I will serve drinks while 
the others speak. I will ask each 
in turn. Doctor, will you be good 
enough to wait while the finan- 
cial secretary speaks?” 

“I should think,” said the doc- 
tor irritably, “that the lad would 
be wanting to think over his 
choice. Does he want me to cut 
him in two, here, tonight, or 
doesn’t he? I should think that 
would take priority, wouldn’t 
you?” 

“Ladies and gentlemen,” said 
the Lord Redlady, “the mister 
and doctor Wentworth has a 

THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



very good point indeed. But 
there is no sense in asking Rod 
about being cut in two unless he 
knows why. Mister financial 
secretary, will you tell us all 
what happened last night?” 

John Fisher stood up. He was 
so chubby that it did not matter. 
His brown, suspicious,, intelli- 
gent eyes looked over the lot of 
them. 

“There are as many kinds of 
money as there are worlds with 
people on them. We here on 
Norstrilia don’t carry the tokens 
around, but in some places they 
have bits of paper or metal 
which they use to keep count 
We talk our money into the cen- 
tral computers which even out 
all our transactions for us. Now 
what would happen if I wanted 
a pair of shoes?” 

Nobody answered. He didn’t 
expect them to. 

“I would,” he went on, “go to 
a shop and look in the screen 
at the shoes which the offworld 
merchants keep in orbit. I would 
pick out the shoes I wanted. 
What’s a good price for a pair 
of shoes in orbit?” 

Hopper was getting tired of 
these rhetorical questions so he 
answered promptly, “Six bob.” 
“That’s right. Six minicredits.” 
“But that’s orbit money. 
You’re leaving out the tariff,” 
said Hopper. 

“Exactly. And what’s the tar- 

79 



Iff?” asked John Fisher, snap- 
ping. 

Hopper snapped back, “Two 
hundred thousand times, what 
you bloody fools always make it 
in the Commonwealth council.” 

“Hopper, can you buy shoes?” 
said Fisher. 

“Of course I can!” The station 
hand looked belligerent again 
but the Lord Redlady was filling 
his glass. He sniffed the aroma, 
calmed down and said, “All 
right, what’s your point?” 

“The point is that the money 
in orbit is SAD money — S for 
secure, A for and, D for deliver- 
ed. That’s any kind of good 
money with backing behind it. 
Stroon is the best backing there 
is, but gold is all right. Rare 
metals, fine manufactures, and 
so on. That’s just the money off 
the planet, in the hands of the 
recipient. Now how many times 
would a ship have to hop to get 
to Old Earth itself?” 

“Fifty or sixty,” said Aunt 
Doris unexpectedly. “Even I 
know that.” 

“And how many ships get 
through?” 

“They all do,” said she. 

“Oh, no,” cried several of the 
men in unison. 

“About one ship is lost every 
sixty or eighty trips, depending 
on the solar weather, on the 
skills of the pinlighters and go- 
captains, on the landing acci- 



dents. Did any of you ever see 
a really old captain?” 

“Yes,” said Hopper with 
gloomy humor, “a dead one in 
his coffin.” 

“So if you have something 
you want to get to Earth, you 
have to pay your share of the 
costly ships, your share of the 
go-captain’s wages and the fees 
of his staff, your share of the 
insurance for their families. Do 
you know what it could cost to 
get this chair back to earth?** 
said Fisher. 

“Three hundred times the cost 
of the chair,” said doctor Went- 
worth. 

“Mighty close. It’s two hun- 
dred and eighty-seven times.” 
“How do you know so muck- 
ing much?” said Bill, speaking 
up. “And why waste our time 
with all this crutting glubb?” 
“Watch your language, man,” 
said John Fisher. “There are 
some mucking ladies present. 
I tell you this because we have 
to get Rod off to Earth tonight, 
if he wants to be alive and rich.” 
“That’s what you say!” cried 
Bill. “Let him go to his house. 
We can load up on little bombs 
and hold up against anybody 
who could get through the Nors- 
trilian defenses. What are we 
paying these mucking taxes for, 
if it’s not for the likes of you 
to make sure we’re safe? Let’s 
take the boy home. Come along.”

GALAXY 



'T'he Lord Redlady leaped to 
the middle of his own floor. 
He was no prancing Earthman 
putting on a show. He was the 
old Instrumentality itself, sur- 
viving with raw weapons and raw 
brains. In his hand he held a 
something which none of them 
could see clearly. 

“Murder,” he said, “will be 
done this moment if anybody 
moves. I will commit it. I will, 
people. Move, and try me! And 
if I do commit a murder, I will 
arrest myself, hold a trial and 
acquit myself. I have strange 
powers, people. Don’t make me 
use them. Don’t even make me 
show them.” The shimmering 
thing in his hand disappeared. 
“Mister and doctor Wentworth, 
you are under my command, by 
loan. Other people, you are my 
guests. Be warned. Don’t touch 
that boy. This is Earth territory, 
this cabin we’re in.” He stood 
a little to one side and looked 
at them brightly out of his 
strange Earth eyes. 

Hopper deliberately spat on 
the floor. “I suppose I would be 
a puddle of mucking glue if I 
helped old Bill?” 

“Something like it,” said the 
Lord Redlady. “Want to try?” 
The things that were hard to 
see were now in each of his 
hands. His eyes darted between 
Bill and Hopper. 

“Shut up, Hopper. We’ll take 



Rod if he tells us to go. But if 
he doesn’t — it crudding well 
doesn’t matter. Eh, mister and 
owner McBan?” 

Rod looked around for his 
grandfather, dead long ago: then 
he knew they were looking at 
him instead. Tom between sleep- 
iness and anxiety he answered. 

“I don’t want to go now, fel- 
lows. Thank you for standing by. 
Go on, mister secretary, with the 
foe money and the sad money.” 
The weapons disappeared 
from the Lord Redlady’s hands. 

“I don’t like Earth weapons,” 
said Hopper, speaking very 
loudly and plainly to no one at 
all, “and I don’t like Earth peo- 
ple. They’re dirty. There’s noth- 
ing in them that’s good honest 
crook.” 

“Have a drink, lads,” said the 
Lord Redlady with a democratic 
heartiness which was so false 
that the workwoman, Eleanor, 
silent all the evening, let out one 
wild caw of a laugh, like a kook- 
aburra beginning to whoop in 
a tree. He looked at her sharply, 
picked up his serving jug, and 
nodded to the financial secre- 
tary, John Fischer, that he should 
resume speaking. 

Fisher was flustered. He ob- 
viously did not like this Earth 
practice of quick threats and 
weapons indoors. But then Lord 
Redlady — disgraced and re- 
mote from Old Earth as he was 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



81 



— was nevertheless the accred- 
ited diplomat of the Instrumen- 
tality. Even Old North Austra- 
lia did not push the Instrumen- 
tality too far. There were ugly 
things surmised about worlds 
which had done so. 

Soberly and huffily he went 
on. 

“There’s not much to it. If the 
money is discounted thirty-three 
and one third per cent per trip, 
and if it is fifty-five trips to get 
to Old Earth, it takes a heap of 
money to pay up in orbit right 
here before you have a mini- 
credit on earth. Sometimes the 
odds are better. Your Common- 
wealth government waits for 
months and years to get a really 
favorable rate of exchange. And 
of course we send our freight by 
armed sailships, which don’t go 
below the surface of space at all. 
They just take hundreds or thou- 
sands of years to get there, while 
our cruisers dart in and out 
around them, just to make sure 
that nobody robs them in trans- 
it. There are things about Nors- 
trilian robots which none of you 
know, and which not even the 
Instrumentality knows.” 

He darted a quick look at the 
Lord Redlady, who said nothing 
to this, and went on. “It is well 
worth while not to muck around 
with one of our perishing ships. 
We don’t get robbed much. And 
we have other things that are 



even worse than Mother Hitton 
and her littul kittons. But the 
money and the stroon which fin- 
ally reaches Old Earth Itself is 
FOE money. F, O, E. F is for 
Free, O is for On, E is for Earth. 
F, O, E — free on Earth. That’s 
the best kind of money there is, 
right on Old Earth Itself. And 
Earth has the final exchange 
computer. Or had it.” 

“Had it?” said the Lord Red- 
lady. 

“It broke down last night. Rod 
broke it. Overload.” 

“Impossible!” cried Redlady. 
"I’ll check.” 

Tie went to the wall, pulled 
-*■ down a desk. A console, in- 
credibly miniature, gleamed out 
at them. In less than three sec- 
onds it glowed. Redlady spoke 
into it, his voice as clear and 
cold as the ice they had all heard 
about : 

“Priority. Instrumentality. 
Short of War. Instant. Instant. 
Redlady calling. Earthport.” 
“Confirmed,” said a Norstri- 
lian voice, “confirmed and 
charged.” 

“Earthport,” said the console 
in a whistling whisper which 
filled the room. 

“Redlady instrumentality of- 
ficial centputer allrightquestion 
cargo approved question out.” 
“Cenputer allright cargo ap- 
proved out,” said the whisper. 



82 



GALAXY 



The people in the room had 
seen an immense fortune squan- 
dered. Even by Norstrilian stan- 
dards, the faster-than-light mes- 
sages were things which a family 
might not use twice in a thou- 
sand years. They looked at Red- 
lady as though he were an evil- 
worker with strange powers. 
Earth’s prompt answer to the 
skinny man made them all re- 
member that though Old North 
Australia produced the wealth, 
Earth still distributed much of 
it — and that the super-govern- 
ment of the Instrumentality 
reached into far places where no 
Norstrilian would even wish to 
venture. 

The Lord Redlady spoke 
mildly, “The central computer 
seems to be going again, if your 
government wishes to consult it. 
The ‘cargo’ is this boy here.” 

“You’ve told Earth about 
me?” said Rod. 

“Why not? We want to get 
you there alive.” 

“But message security — ?” 
said the doctor. 

“I have references which no 
outside mind will know,” said 
the Lord Redlady. “Finish up, 
mister financial secretary. Tell 
the young man what he has on 
Earth.” 

“Your computer outcomputed 
the government,” said John Fish- 
er-to-the-hundredth, “and it 
mortgaged all your lands, all 



your sheep, all your trading 
rights, all your family treasures, 
the right to the MacArthur 
name, the right to the McBan 
name and itself. Then it bought 
futures. Of course, it didn’t do it. 
You did, Rod McBan.” 

Startled into full awakeness, 
Rod found his right hand up at 
his mouth, so surprised was he. 
“I did?” 

“Then you bought futures in 
stroon, but you offered them for 
sale. You held back the sales, 
shifting titles and changing 
prices, so that not even the cen- 
tral computer knew what you 
were doing. You bought almost 
all of the eighth year from now, 
most of the seventh year from 
now, and some of the sixth. You 
mortgaged each purchase as you 
went along, in order to buy 
more. Then you suddenly tore 
the market wide open by offer- 
ing fantastic bargains, trading 
the six-year rights for seventh- 
year and eighth-year. Your com- 
puter made such lavish use of 
Instant Messages to Earth that 
the Commonwealth defense of- 
fice had people buzzing around 
in the middle of the night. By 
the time they figured out what 
might happen, it had happened. 
You registered a monopoly of 
two year’s export, far beyond 
the predicted amount. The gov- 
ernment rushed for a weather 
recomputation, but while they 



84 



GALAXY 



were doing that you were regis- 
tering your holdings on Earth 
and re-mortgaging them in FOE 
money. With the FOE money 
you began to buy up all the im- 
ports around Old North Austra- 
lia, and when the government 
finally declared an emergency, 
you had secured final title to one 
and a half stroon years and to 
more megacredits, FOE money 
megacredits, than the Earth com- 
puters could handle. You’re the 
richest man that ever was. Or 
ever will be. We changed all the 
rules this morning and I my- 
self signed a new treaty with the 
Earth authorities, ratified by 
the Instrumentality. Meanwhile, 
you’re the richest of the rich 
men who ever lived on this 
world. And you’re also rich 
enough to buy all of Old Earth. 
In fact, you have put in a reser- 
vation to buy it, unless the In- 
strumentality outbids you.” 
“Why should we?” said the 
Lord Redlady. “Let him have it. 
Well watch what he does with 
the Earth after he buys it. If it 
is something bad, we will kill 
him.” 

Y ou’d kill me, Lord Red- 
lady?” said Rod. “I thought 
you were saving me?” 

“Both,” said the doctor, stand- 
ing up. “The Commonwealth 
government has not tried to take 
your property away from you, 



though they have their doubts ae 
to what you will do with Earth 
if you do buy it. They are not 
going to let you stay on this plan- 
et and endanger it by being the 
richest kidnap victim who ever 
lived. Tomorrow they will strip 
you of your property, unless you 
want to take a chance on run- 
ning foi it. Earth government is 
the same way. If you can figure 
out your own defenses, you can 
come on in. Of course the police 
will protect you, but would that 
be enough? I’m a doctor. And 
I’m here to ship you out if you 
want to go.” 

“And I’m an officer of govern- 
ment, and I will arrest you if 
you do not go,” said John Fisher. 

“And I represent the Instru- 
mentality, which does not de- 
clare its policy to anyone, least 
of all to outsiders. But it is my 
personal policy,” said the Lord 
Redlady, holding out his hands 
and twisting his thumbs in a 
meaningless, grotesque, but 
somehow very threatening way, 
“to see that this boy gets a safe 
trip to Earth and a fair deal 
when he comes back here!” 

“You’ll protect him all the 
way!” cried Lavinia, looking 
very happy. 

“All the way. As far as I can. 
As long as I live.” 

“That’s pretty long,” muttered 
Hopper, “conceited little 
pommy cockahoop!” 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH

“Watch your language, Hop- 
per,” said the Lord Redlady. 
“Rod?” 

“Yes, sir?” 

“Your answer?” The Lord 
Redlady was peremptory. 

“I’m going,” said Rod. 

“What on Earth do you 
want?” said the Lord Redlady 
ceremoniously. 

“A genuine Cape triangle.” 
“A what?” cried the Lord 
Redlady. 

“A Cape triangle. A postage 
stamp.” 

“What’s postage?” said the 
Lord Redlady, really puzzled. 
“Payments on messages.” 

“But you do that with thumb- 
prints or eyeprints!” 

“No,” said Rod, “I mean paper 
ones.” 

“Paper messages?” said the 
Lord Redlady, looking as though 
someone had mentioned grass 
battleships, hairless sheep, solid 
cast-iron women, or something 
else equally improbable. “Paper 
messages?” he repeated, and 
then he laughed, quite charming- 
ly. “Oh!” he said, with a tone 
of secret discovery. “You mean 
antiquities . ?” 

“Of course,” said Rod. “Even 
before Space itself.” 

“Earth has a lot of antiquities, 
and I am sure you will be wel- 
come to study them or to collect 
them. That will be perfectly all 
right Just don’t do any of the 



wrong things, or you will be in 
real trouble.” 

“What are the wrong things?” 
said Rod. 

“Buying real people, or try- 
ing to. Shipping religion from 
one planet to another. Smug- 
gling underpeople.” 

“What’s religion?” said Rod. 
“Later, later,” said the Lord 
Redlady. “You’ll learn every- 
thing later. Doctor, you take 
over.” 

X T 7"entworth stood very care- 
* 'fully so that his head did 
not touch the ceiling. He had to 
bend his neck a little. “We have 
two boxes, Rod.” 

When he spoke, the door 
whirred in its tracks and showed 
them a small room beyond. 
There was a large box, like a 
coffin, and a very small box, like 
the kind that women have 
around the house to keep a 
single party-going bonnet in. 

“There will be criminals, and 
wild governments, and conspira- 
tors, and adventurers, and just 
plain good people gone wrong 
at the thought of your wealth. 
There will be all these waiting 
for you to kidnap you or rob 
or even kill you — ” 

“Why kill me?” 

“To impersonate you and to try 
to get your money,” said the doc- 
tor. “Now look. This is your big 
choice. If you take the big box. 



86 



GALAXY 



we can put you in a sail-ship 
convoy and you will get there in 
several hundred or thousand 
years. But you will get there, 
ninety-nine point ninety-nine 
per cent. Or we can send the big 
box on the regular pianoform- 
ing ships, and somebody will 
steal you. Or we scun you down 
and put you in the little box.” 
“That little box?” cried Rod. 
“Scunned. You’ve scunned 
sheep, haven’t you?” 

“I’ve heard of it. But a man, 
no! Dehydrate my body, pickle 
my head, and freeze the whole 
mucking mess?” cried Rod. 

“That’s it. Too bloody right!” 
cried the doctor cheerfully. 
“That’ll give you a real chance 
of getting there alive.” 

“But who’ll put me together. 
I’d need my own doctor — ?” 
His voice quavered at the un- 
naturalness of the risk, not at 
the mere chanciness and danger 
of it. 

“Here,” said the Lord Red- 
lady, “is your doctor, already 
trained.” 

“I am at your service,” said 
the little Earth-animal, the 
“monkey,” with a small bow to 
the assembled company. “My 
name is A’gentur and I have 
been conditioned as a physician, 
a surgeon and a barber.” 

The women had gasped. Hop- 
per and Bill stared at the little 
animal in horror. 



“You’re an underperson!” 
yelled Hopper. “We’ve never let 
the crutting things loose on 
Norstrilia.” 

“I’m not an underperson. I’m 
an animal. Conditioned to — ” 
The monkey jumped. Hopper’s 
heavy knife twanged like a mu- 
sical instrument as it clung to 
the softer steel of the wall. Har- 
per’s other hand held a long thin 
knife, ready to reach Redlady’s 
heart. 

The left hand of the Lord 
Redlady flashed straight for- 
ward. Something in his hand 
glowed silently terribly. There 
was a hiss in the air. 

XIV 

'll There Hopper had been, a 
' 'cloud of oily thick smoke, 
stinking of burning meat, coiled 
slowly toward the ventilators. 
Hopper’s clothing and personal 
belongings, including one false 
tooth, lay on the chair in which 
he had been sitting. They were 
undamaged. His drink stood on 
the floor beside the chair, for- 
ever to remain unfinished. 

The doctor’s eyes gleamed as 
he stared strangely at Redlady: 
“Noted and reported to the Old 
North Australian Navy.” 

“I’ll report it too,” said the 
Lord Redlady, “as the use of 
illegal weapons on diplomatic 
grounds.” 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



87 



“Never mind,” said John Fish- 
er- to- the -hundredth, not angry at 
all, but just pale and looking a 
little ill. Violence did not fright- 
en him, but decision did. “Let’s 
get on with it Which box, big 
or little, boy?” 

The workwoman Eleanor 
stood up. She had said nothing 
but now she dominated the 
scene. “Take him in there, girls,” 
she said, “and wash him like 
you would for the Garden of 
Death. Ill wash myself in there. 
You see,” she added, “I’ve al- 
ways wanted to see the blue 
skies of earth, and wanted to 
swim in a house that ran around 
on the big big waters. I’ll take 
your big box, Rod. If I get 
through alive, you will owe me 
some treats on earth. You take 
the little box, Roddy, take the 
little box and that little tiny 
doctor with the fur on him. Rod, 
I trust him.” 

Rod stood up. 

Everybody was looking at him 
and at Eleanor. 

Said the Lord Redlady, “You 
agree to be scunned and put in 
the little box for instant ship- 
ment to Earth?” 

He nodded. 

“You will pay all the extra 
expense?” 

He nodded again. 

The doctor said, “You author- 
ize me to cut you up and reduce 
you down, in the hope that you 



may be reconstituted on Earth?” 

Rod nodded to him, too. 

“Shaking your head isn’t 
enough,” said the doctor. “You 
have to agree for the record.” 

“I agree,” said Rod quietly. 

Aunt Doris and Lavinia came 
forward to lead him into the 
dressing room and shower room. 
Just as they reached for his 
arms, the doctor patted Rod on 
the back with a quick strange 
motion. Rod jumped a little. 

“Deep hypnotic,” said the doc- 
tor. “You can manage his body 
all right, but the next words he 
utters will be said, luck willing, 
on Old Earth Itself.” 

The women were wide-eyed 
but they led Rod forward to be 
cleaned for the operations and 
the voyage. 

The doctor turned to die Lord 
Redlady and to John Fisher, the 
financial secretary. 

“A good night’s work,” he 
said. “Pity about that man, 
though.” 

Bill sat still, frozen with grief 
in his chair, staring at Hopper’s 
empty clothing in the chair next 
to him. 

The console tinkled, “Twelve 
hours, Greenwich mean time. 
No adverse weather reports from 
the channel coast or from Meeya 
Meefla or Earthport building. 
All’s well!” 

The Lord Redlady served 
drinks to the misters. He did not 



88 



GALAXY 



even offer one to Bill. It would 
have been no use, at this point. 

TT'rom beyond the door, where 
they were cleaning the body, 
clothes and hair of the deeply 
hypnotized Rod, Lavinia and 
Aunt Doris unconsciously re- 
verted to the ceremony of the 
Garden of Death and lifted their 
voices in a sort of plainsong 
chant : 

Out in the Garden of Death, our young 
Have tasted the valiant taste of fear. 
With muscular arm and reckless tongue. 
They have won, and lost, and escaped 
us here! 

The three men listened for a 
few moments, attentively. From 
the other washroom there came 
the sounds of the workwoman 
Eleanor, washing herself, alone 
and unattended, for a long voy- 
age and a possible death. 

The Lord Redlady heaved a 
sigh. “Have a drink, Bill. Hop- 
per brought it on himself.” 

Bill refused to speak to them 
but he held forth his glass. 

The Lord Redlady filled that 
and the others. He turned to 
John Fisher to-the-hundreth 
and said, “You’re shipping 
him?” 

“Who?” 

“The boy.” 

“I thought so.” 

“Better not,” said the Lord 
Redlady. 

“You mean —danger?” 



“That's only half the word for 
it,” said die Lord Redlady. “You 
can’t possibly plan to offload 
him at Earth port. Put him into 
a good medical station. There’s 
an old one, still good, on Mars, 
if they haven’t closed it down. 
I know Earth. Half the people 
of Earth will be waiting to greet 
him and the other half will be 
waiting to rob him.” 

“You represent the Earth gov- 
ernment, sir and commissioner,” 
said John Fisher. “That’s a rum 
way to talk about your own peo- 
ple.” 

“They’re not that way all the 
time,” laughed Redlady. “Just 
when they’re in heat. Sex hasn’t 
a chance to compare with money 
when it comes to the human 
race on earth. They all think 
that they want power and free- 
dom and six other impossible 
things. I’m not speaking for the 
Earth government when I say 
this. Just for myself.” 

“If we don’t ship him, who 
will?” demanded Fisher. 

“The Instrumentality.” 

“The Instrumentality? You 
don’t conduct commerce. How 
can you?” 

“We don’t conduct commerce, 
but we do meet emergencies. I 
can flag down a long-jump cruis- 
er and he’ll be there months be- 
fore anybody expects him.” 
“Those are warships. Y ou can’t 
use one for passengers!” 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



89 



“Can’t I?” said the Lord Red- 
lady, with a smile. 

“The Instrumentality would 
— ?” said Fisher, with a puzzled 
smile. “The cost would be tre- 
mendous. How will you pay for 
it? It’d be hard to justify.” 

“He will pay for it. Special 
donation from him for special 
service. One megacredit for the 
trip.” 

The financial secretary whis- 
tled. “That’s a fearful price for 
a single trip. You’d want SAD 
money and not surface money, 
I suppose?” 

“No. FOE money.” 

“Hot buttered moonbeams, 
man! That’s a thousand times 
the most expensive trip that any 
person has ever had.” 

The big doctor had been lis- 
tening to the two of them. “Mis- 
ter and owner Fisher,” he said, 
“I recommend it.” 

“You?” cried John Fisher 
angrily. “You’re a Norstrilian 
and you want to rob this poor 
boy?” 

“Poor boy?” snorted the doc- 
tor. “It’s not that. The trip’s no 
good if he’s not alive. Our friend 
here is extravagant but his ideas 
stre sound. I suggest one amend- 
ment.” 

“What’s that?” said the Lord 
Redlady quickly. 

“One and a half megacredits 
for the round trip. If he is well 
and alive and with the same per- 



sonality, apart from natural 
cause. But note this. One kilo- 
credit only if you deliver him 
on Earth dead.” 

J ohn Fisher rubbed his chin. 

His suspicious eyes looked 
down at Redlady, who had taken 
a seat, and up at the doctor, 
whose head was still bumping 
the ceiling. 

A voice behind him spoke. 
“Take it, mister financial sec- 
retary. The boy won’t use money 
if he’s dead. You can’t fight the 
Instrumentality, you can’t be 
reasonable with the Instrumen- 
tality, and you can’t buy the In- 
strumentality. With what they’ve 
been taking off us all these 
thousands of years, they’ve got 
more stroon than we do, hidden 
away somewhere. You, there!” 
said he rudely to the Lord Red- 
lady. “Do you have any idea 
what the Instrumentality is 
worth?” 

The Lord Redlady creased his 
brow. “Never thought of it. I 
suppose it must have a limit, 
but I never thought of it. We 
do have accountants, though.” 
“See,” said Bill. “Even the 
Instrumentality would hate to 
lose money. Take the doctor’s 
bid, Redlady. Take him up on 
it, Fisher.” His use of their sur- 
names was an extreme incivility, 
but the two men were convinced. 
“I’ll do it,” said Redlady. "It’s 



90 



GALAXY 



awfully close to writing insur- 
ance, which we a. ; not chartered 
to do. I’ll write it in as his emer- 
gency clause.” 

“I’ll take it,” said John Fish- 
er. “It’ll be thousands of years 
until another Norstrilian finan- 
cial secretary pays money for a 
ticket like this, but it’s worth it. 
To him. I’ll square it in his ac- 
counts to our planet.” 

“I’ll witness it,” said the doc- 
tor. 

“No, you won’t,” said Bill 
savagely. “The boy has one 
friend here. That’s me. Let me 
do it.” 

They stared at him, all three. 
He stared back. 

He broke. “Sirs and misters, 
please let me be the witness.” 

The Lord Redlady nodded 
and opened the console. He and 
John Fisher spoke the contract 
into it. At the end Bill shouted 
his full name as witness. 

The two women brought Rod 
McBan, mother-naked, into the 
room. He was immaculately 
clean and he stared ahead as 
though he were in an endless 
dream. 

“That’s the operating room,” 
said the Lord Redlady. “I’ll 
spray us all with antiseptic 
if you don’t mind.” 

“Of course,” said the doctor. 

“You’re going to cut him up 
and boil him down — here and 
now?” cried Aunt Doris. 



“Here and now,” said the 
Lord Redlady, “if the doctor ap- 
proves. The soone. he goes, the 
better chance he has of coming 
through the whole thing alive.” 

“I consent,” said the doctor. 
“I approve.” 

He started to take Rod by the 
hand, leading him toward the 
room with the long coffin and 
the small box. At some sign from 
Redlady, the walls had opened 
up to show a complete surgical 
theater. 

“Wait a moment,” said the 
Lord Redlady. “Take your col- 
league.” 

“Colleague?” saidthe giant. 

“A’gentur,” said Redlady. 
“It’ll be he who puts Rod to- 
gether again.” 

“Of course,” said the doctor. 

The monkey had jumped out 
of his basket when he heard his 
name mentioned. 

Together, tire giant and the 
monkey led Rod into the little 
gleaming room. They closed the 
door behind them. 

The ones who were left behind 
sat down nervously. 

“Mister and owner Redlady,” 
said Bill, “since I’m staying, 
could I have some more of that 
drink?” 

“Of course, sir and mister,” 
said the Lord Redlady, not hav- 
ing any idea of what Bill’s titla 
might be. 

There were no screams from 

*1 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



Rod, no thuds, no protest. There 
was the cloying sweet horror of 
unknown medicines creeping 
through the airvents. The two 
women said nothing as the 
group of people sat around. 
Eleanor, wrapped in an enor- 
mous towel, came and sat with 
them. In the second hour of the 
operations on Rod, Lavinia be- 
gan sobbing. 

She couldn’t help it. 

'TT'hat very night it happened. 

They scunned him; they re- 
duced him; they froze him; 
they dehydrated him. 

The Lord Redlady arranged a 
relay with the special courier 
ship which would run him to 
Earth itself. 

These things were supposed to 
be secret, but they could not be 
kept completely secret. We all 
know that no communications 
systems are wholly leak-proof. 
Even inside the vast networks of 
the Instrumentality, shielded, 
coded and protected though they 
were, there were soft electronic 
spots, weak administrative 
points, or garrulous men here 
and there. The old computer 
had not allowed for ordinary 
human wickedness. It understood 
the human rules, but not the 
temptations to break the rules. 
All the messages concerning 
Rod’s vast speculations had been 
sent in the clear. It was no won- 



der that on many worlds, people 
saw Rod as a chance, an oppor- 
tunity, a victim, a benefactor, or 
an enemy. 

We all know the old rhyme: 

Luck Is hot and people funny. 

Everybody’s fond of money. 

Lost a chance and sell your mother. 

Win the pot and buy another. 

Other people fall and crash : 

You could win the pot of cash! 

It applied in this case, too. 
People ran hot and cold with 
the news. 

On Earth, Commissioner Tea- 
drinker wondered if he dared 
kidnap this rich man who was 
coming and hold him to ransom. 
It was illegal, but Teadrinker 
was so old that he had outlived 
mere legality. 

At Viola Siderea, the Council 
of Thieves sent the Chief of 
Thieves in pursuit, spending 
hard-stolen money on honest 
lease of patrol ships, so great 
was their urgency. 

At the heart of the underpeo- 
ple world, an unknown magister 
invoked the seven logoi and the 
three Nameless Ones, hoping 
that the stranger might bring 
great tidings. 

The Commonwealth Council 
of Old North Australia sat on 
the matter and decided to send 
along a full dozen' McBan im- 
personations, just to throw rob- 
bers and interceptors off the 
track. They did not do this be- 



92 



GALAXY 



cause they loved Rod, or be- 
cause they had special regard for 
him as an individual citizen, but 
because it was against their prin- 
ciples to let any Old North Aus- 
tralian to be robbed with im- 
punity. 

And Rod — 

Rod woke on Mars, already 
reconstituted. 

XV 

D od woke with a strange feel- 
ing of well-being. In a cor- 
ner of his mind there were mem- 
ories of pandemonium — 
knives, blood, medicine, a mon- 
key working as surgeon. Rum 
dreams! He glanced around and 
immediately tried to jump out 
of bed. 

The whole world was on fire! 

Bright blazing intolerable fire, 
like a blowtorch. 

But the bed held him. He 
realized that a loose comfortable 
jacket ended in tapes and that 
the tapes were anchored in some 
way to the bed. 

“Eleanor!” he shouted. “Come 
here!” 

He remembered the mad bird 
attacking him, Lavinia transport- 
ing him to the cabin of the sharp 
Earthman, Lord Redlady. He re- 
membered medicines and fuss. 
But this — what was this? 

When the door opened, more 
of the intolerable light poured 



in. It was as though every cloud 
had been stripped from the sky 
of Old North Australia, leaving 
only the blazing heavens and 
the fiery sun. There were people 
who had seen that happen, when 
the weather machines occasion- 
ally broke down and let a hurri- 
cane cut a hole in the clouds, but 
it had certainly not happened 
in his time, or in his grandfa- 
ther’s time. 

The man who entered was 
pleasant, but he was no Norstri- 
lian. His shoulders were slight. 
He did not look as though he 
could lift a cow, and his face 
had been washed so long and 
so steadily that it looked like a 
baby’s face.He had an odd medi- 
cal-looking suit on, all white, 
and his face combined the smile 
and the ready professional sym- 
pathy of a good physician. 

“We’re feeling better, I see,” 
said he. 

“Where on earth am I?” 
asked Rod. “In a satellite? It 
feels odd.” 

“You’re not on Earth, man.” 

“I know I’m not. I’ve never 
been there. Where’s this place?” 

“Mars. The Old Star Station. 
I’m Jeanjacques Vomact.” Rod 
mumbled the name so badly that 
the other man had to spell it 
out for him. When that was 
straightened out, Rod came back 
to the subject. 

“Where’s Mars? Can you un- 

93 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



tie me? When’s that light going 
to go off?” 

“I’ll untie you right now,” 
said Doctor Vomact, “but stay 
in bed and take it easy until 
we’ve given you some food and 
taken some tests. The light — 
that’s sunshine. I’d say it’s about 
seven hours, local time, before 
it goes off. This is late morning. 
Don’t you know what Mars is? 
It’s a planet.” 

“New Mars, you mean,” said 
Rod proudly, “the one with the 
enormous shops and the zoologi- 
cal gardens.” 

“The only shops we have here 
are the cafeteria and the PX. 
New Mars? I’ve heard of that 
place somewhere. It does have 
big shops and some kind of an 
animal show. Elephants you can 
hold in your hand. This isn’t 
that place at all. Wait a sec, I’ll 
roll your bed to the window.” 

Rod looked eagerly out of the 
window. It was frightening. A 
naked, dark sky did not have a 
cloud in sight. A few holes 
showed in it here and there. 
They almost looked like the 
“stars” which people saw when 
they were in spaceship transit 
from one cloudy planet to an- 
other. Dominating everything 
was a single explosive horrible 
light, which hung high and 
steady in the sky without ever 
going off. He found himself 
cringing for the explosion, but 



he could tell, from the posture 
of the doctor next to him, that 
the doctor was not in the least 
afraid of that chronic hydrogen 
bomb, whatever it might turn 
out to be. Keeping his voice 
level and trying not to sound like 
a boy he said, “What’s that?” 

“The sun.” 

T'Von’t cook my book, mate! 

Give me the straight truth. 
Everybody calls his star a sun. 
What’s this one?” 

“The sun. The original sun. 
The sun of Old Earth Itself. Just 
as this is plain Mars. Not even 
Old Mars. Certainly not New 
Mars. This is Earth’s neighbor.” 

“That thing never goes off, 
goes up — boom ! — or goes 

down?” 

“The sun, you mean?” said 
Doctor Vomact. “No, I should 
think not. I suppose it looked 
that way to your ancestors and 
mine half a million years ago, 
when we were all running 
around naked on Earth.” The 
doctor busied himself as he talk- 
ed. He chopped the air with a 
strange-looking little key, and 
the tapes fell loose. The mittens 
dropped off Rod’s hands. Rod 
looked at his own hands in the 
intense light and saw that they 
seemed strange. They looked 
smooth and naked and clean, 
like the doctor’s own hands. 
Weird memories began to come 



94 



GALAXY 



back to him, but his handicap 
about spieking and hiering tele- 
pathically had made him cau- 
tious and sensitive, so he did not 
give himself away. 

“If this is old, old Mars, what 
are you doing, talking the Old 
North Australian language to 
me? I thought my people were 
the only ones in the universe 
who still spoke Ancient Inglish.” 
He shifted proudly but clumsily 
over to the Old Common 
Tongue: “You see, the Appoint- 
ed Ones of my family taught me 
this language as well. I’ve never 
been offworld before.” 

“I speak your language,” said 
the doctor, “because I learned 
it. I learned it because you paid 
me, very generously, to learn it. 
In the months that we have been 
reassembling you, it’s come in 
handy. We just let down the 
portal of memory and identity 
today, but I’ve talked to you for 
hundreds of hours already.” 

Rod tried to speak. 

He couldn’t utter a word. His 
throat was dry and he was afraid 
that he might throw up. 

The doctor put a friendly 
hand on his arm. “Easy, mister 
and owner McBan, easy now. 
We all do that when we come 
out.” 

Rod croaked, “I’ve been dead. 
Dead. Me?” 

“Not exactly dead,” said the 
doctor, “but close to it.” 



“The box — that little boxP 
cried Rod. 

"What little box?” 

“Please, doctor — the one I 
came in?” 

“That box wasn’t so little," 
said Doctor Vomact. He squared 
his hands in the air and made 
a shape about the size of the 
little ladies’ bonnet-box which 
Rod had seen in the Lord Red- 
lady’s private operating room. 
“It was this big. Your head wai 
full natural size. That’s why it's 
been so easy and so successful 
to bring you back to normality 
in such a hurry.” 

“And Eleanor?” 

“Your companion? She made 
it, too. Nobody intercepted the 
ship.” 

“You mean the rest is true, 
too? I’m still the richest man 
in the universe? And I’m gone, 
gone from home?” Rod would 
have liked to beat the bed- 
spread, but did not. 

“I am glad,” said Doctor Vo- 
mact, “to see you express so 
much feeling about your situa- 
tion. You showed a great deal 
when you were under the seda- 
tives and hypnotics, but I waa 
beginning to wonder how we 
could help you realize your true 
position when you came back, as 
you now have, to normal life. 
Forgive me for talking this way. 
I sound like a medical journal. 
It’s hard to be friends with a 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



95 



patient, even when one really 
likes him.” 

TT'riends they became in the 
ensuing days. After several 
weeks, Vomact came to the plans 
he had — when Rod was well 
enough — for the disguise for a 
trip to Earth. 

“What are you going to do to 
me, sir and doctor?” asked Rod. 

“Anything you want,” said 
Vomact lightly. 

“Really, now. What?” 

“Well,” said Vomact, “the 
Lord Redlady sent along a whole 
cube of suggestions. Keep your 
personality. Keep your retinal 
and brain images. Change your 
appearance. Change your work- 
woman into a young man who 
looks just like your description.” 
“You can’t do that to Eleanor. 
She’s a citizen.” 

“Not here, not on Mars, she 
isn’t. She’s your baggage.” 

“But her legal rights!” 

“This is Mars, Rod, but it’s 
Earth territory. Under Earth 
law. Under the direct control of 
the Instrumentality. We can do 
these things all right. The hard 
thing is this. Would you consent 
to passing for an underman?” 

“I never saw one. How would 
I know?” said Rod. 

“Could you stand the shame 
of it?” 

Rod laughed. 

Vomact sighed. “You’re funny 



people, you Norstrilians. I’d 
rather die than be mistaken for 
an underman. The disgrace of 
it, the contempt! But the Lord 
Redlady said that you could 
walk into Earth as free as a 
breeze if we made you pass for 
a cat-man. I might as well tell 
you, Rod. Your wife is already 
here.” 

Rod stopped walking. “My 
wife? I have no wife.” 

“Your cat-wife,” said the doc- 
tor. “Of course it isn’t real mar- 
riage. Underpeople aren’t allow- 
ed to have it. But they have a 
companionship which looks 
something like marriage and we 
sometimes slip and call them 
husband and wife. The Instru- 
mentality has already sent a cat- 
girl out to be your ‘wife.’ She’ll 
travel back to Earth with you 
from Mars. You’ll just be a pair 
of lucky cats who have been do- 
ing dances and acrobatics for 
the bored station personnel 
here.” 

“And Eleanor?” 

“I suppose somebody will kill 
her, thinking it’s you. That’s 
what you brought her for, isn’t 
it? Aren’t you rich enough?” 
“No, no, no!” said Rod. “No- 
body is that rich. We have to 
think of something else.” 

They spent the entire walk 
back making new plans which 
would protect Eleanor and Rod 
both.

As they entered the shed port 

and took off their helmets, Rod 
said, “This wife of mine, when 
can I see her?” 

“You won’t overlook her,” 
said Vomact. “She’s as wild as 
fire and twice as beautiful.” 
“Does she have a name?” 

“Of course she does,” said the 
doctor. “They all do.” 

“What is it, then?” 

“C’mell.” 

XVI 

D od walked to the edge of the 
little park. This was utterly 
unlike any ship he had ever seen 
or heard about in Norstrilia. 
There was no noise, no cramp- 
ing, no sign of weapons — just 
a pretty little cabin which 
housed the controls, the Go- 
Captain, the Pinlighters and the 
Stop-Captain, and then a stretch 
of incredible green grass. He 
had walked on this grass from 
the dusty ground of Mars. There 
was a purr and a whisper. A 
false blue sky, very beautiful, 
covered him like a canopy. 

He felt strange. He had whis- 
kers like a cat, forty centimeters 
long, growing out of his upper 
lip, about twelve whiskers to 
each side. The doctor had color- 
ed his eyes with bright green 
irises. His ears reached up to a 
point. He looked like a cat-man 
and he wore the professional 



clothing of an acrobat; C’mell 

did too. 

He had not gotten over C’mell. 

She made every woman in Old 
North Australia look like a sack 
of lard. She was lean, limber, 
smooth, menacing and beautiful; 
she was soft to the touch, hard 
in her motions, quick, alert and 
cuddlesome. Her red hair blazed 
with the silkiness of animal fire. 
She spoke with a soprano which 
tinkled like wild bells. 

Her ancestors and ancestresses 
had been bred to produce the 
most seductive girl on Earth. 
The task had succeeded. Even in 
repose, she was voluptuous. Her 
wide hips and sharp eyes invited 
the masculine passions. Her cat- 
like dangerousness challenged 
every man whom she met. The 
true men who looked at her knew 
that she was a cat, and still 
could not keep their eyes off 
her. Human women treated her 
as though she were something 
disgraceful. She travelled as an 
acrobat, but she had already told 
Rod McBan confidentially that 
she was by profession a “girly- 
girl,” a female animal, shaped 
and trained like a person, to 
serve as hostess to offworld visi- 
tors, required by law and custom 
to invite their love, while prom- 
ised the penalty of death if she 
accepted it. 

Rod liked her, though he had 
been painfully shy with her at 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH 



77 



first. There was no side to her, 
no posh, no swank. Once she got 
down to business, her incredible 
body faded . partway into the 
background, though with the 
sides of his eyes he could never 
quite forget it. It was her mind, 
her intelligence, her humor and 
good humor, which carried them 
across the hours and days they 
spent together. He found him- 
self trying to impress her that 
he was a grown man, only to 
discover that in the spontaneous, 
sincere affections of her quick 
cat-heart, she did not care in the 
least what his status was. He was 
simply her partner and they had 
work to do together. It was his 
job to stay alive and it was her 
job to keep him alive. 

The doctor Vomact had told 
him not to speak to the other 
passengers at all ; at the same 
time, the doctor had asked 
C’mell to tell the other passen- 
gers not to say anything to each 
other, and to call for silence if 
any of them spoke. 

r | 'here were ten other passen 
gers who stared at one-an- 
other in uncomfortable amaze- 
ment. Ten in number, they were. 
All ten of them were Rod Mc- 
Ban. 

Ten identical Roderick Fred- 
erick Ronald Arnold William 
MacArthur McBans to the one 
hundred and fifty-first, all ex- 



actly alike. Apart from C’mell 
herself and the little monkey- 
doctor, A’gentur, the only per- 
son on the ship who was not 
Rod McBan was Rod McBan 
himself. He had become the cat- 
man. The others seemed, each 
by himself, to be persuaded that 
he alone was Rod McBan and 
that the other nine were paro- 
dies. They watched each other 
with a mixture of gloom and sus- 
picion mixed with amusement, 
just as the real Rod McBan 
would have done, had' he been 
in their place. 

“One of them,” said doctor 
Vomact in parting, “is your com- 
panion Eleanor from Norstrilia. 
The other nine are mouse-pow- 
ered robots. They’re all copied 
from you. Good, eh?” He could 
not conceal his professional sat- 
isfaction. 

And now they were all about 
to see the wonders of Old Earth 
itself together. 

C’mell took Rod to the edge 
of the little world and said 
gently, “I want to sing ‘The 
Tower Song’ to you, just before 
we shut down on the top of 
Earthport.” And in her wonder- 
ful voice she sang the strange 
little old song. 

Oh. my love, for you! 

High birds, crying and a 

High sky flying, and a 

High heart striving, and a 

High wind driving, and a 

High brave place — for you!

GALAXY 



Rod felt a little funny, stand- 
ing there, looking at nothing, 
but he also felt pleasant with 
the girl’s head against his shoul- 
der and his arm enfolding her. 
She seemed not only to need 
him, but to trust him very deeply. 
She did not feel adult — not 
self-important and full of unex- 
plained business. She was mere- 
ly a girl, and for the time his 
girl. It was pleasant. It gave him 
a strange foretaste of the future. 

The day might come when he 
would have a permanent girl of 
his own, facing not a day, but 
life; not a danger, but destiny. 
He hoped that he could be as 
relaxed and fond with that fu- 
ture girl as he was with C’mell. 

C’mell squeezed his hand, as 
though in warning. 

He turned to look at her but 
she stared ahead and nodded 
with her chin, 

She said, “Keep watching 
straight ahead. Earth.” 

He looked back at the blank 
blue artificial sky of the ship’s 
force-field. It was a monotonous 
but pleasant blue, conveying 
depths which were not really 
there. 

The change was so fast that 
he wondered whether he had 
really seen it. 

In one moment the clear flat 
blue — then the false sky splash- 
ed apart as though it had literal- 
ly been slashed into enormous 



ribbons, ribbons in their turn 
becoming blue spots and disap- 
pearing. 

Another blue sky was there — 
Earth’s. 

Manhome. 

Rod breathed deeply. It was 
hard to believe. The sky itself 
was not so different from the 
false “sky” which had surround- 
ed the ship on its trip from 
Mars, but there was an aliveness 
and wetness to it, unlike any 
other sky he had ever heard 
about. 

I t was not the sight of earth 
which surprised him — it was 
the smell. He suddenly realized 
that Old North Australia must 
smell dull, flat and dusty to 
Earthmen. This Earth air smel- 
led alive. There were the odors 
of plants, of water, of things 
which he could not even guess. 
The air was coded with a mil- 
lion years of memory. In this 
air his people had swum to man- 
hood, before they conquered the 
stars. The wetness was not the 
cherished damp of one of his 
covered canals. It was wild free 
moisture which came laden with 
the indications of things living, 
dying, sprawling, squirming, 
loving with an abundance which 
no Norstrilian could understand. 
No wonder the descriptions of 
Earth had always seemed fierce 
and exaggerated! What was 



THE BOY WHO BOUGHT OLD EARTH

stroon that men would pay wa- 
ter for it — water, the giver 
and carrier of life. This was 
his home, not matter how many 
generations his people had 
lived in the twisted hells of 
Paradise VII or the dry treas- 
ures of Old North Australia. He 
took a deep breath, feeling the 
plasma of earth pour into him, 
the quick effluvium which had 
made man. He smelled Earth 
again. It would take a long life- 
time, even with stroon, before a 
man could understand all these 
odors which came all the way 
up to the ship, which hovered, 
as pianoforming ships usually did 
not, twenty-odd kilometers above 
the surface of the planet. 

There was something strange 
in this air, something sweet and 
clear to the nostrils, refreshing 
to the spirit. One great beauti- 
ful odor overrode all the others. 
What could it be? He sniffed 
and then said, very clearly, to 
himself. “Salt!” 

C’mell reminded him that he 
was beside her. “Do you like it, 
C’rod?” 

“Yes, yes, it’s better than — ” 
Words failed him. He looked at 
her. Her eager, pretty, comradely 
smile made him feel that she was 
sharing every milligram of his 
delight. “But why,” he asked, 
“do you waste salt on the air? 
What good does it do? Is it to 
clean the ship some way?” . 



“Ship? We’re not cm the ship, 
C’rod. This is the landing roo i 
of Earthport.” 

He gasped. 

No ship? There was not a 
mountain on Old North Aus- 
tralia more than six kilometers 
above mean ground level! And 
these mountains were all smooth, 
worn, old, folded by immense 
eons of wind into a gentle blan- 
keting that covered his whole 
home world. 

He looked around. 

The platform was about two 
hundred meters long by one 
hundred wide. 

The ten “Rod McBans” were 
talking to some men in uniform. 
Far at the other side a steeple 
rose into eye-catching height — 
perhaps a whole half-kilometer. 
He looked down. 

There it was — Old Old 
Earth. 

The treasure of water reached 
before his very eyes — water 
by the millions of tons, enough 
to feed a galaxy of sheep, to 
wash an infinity of men. The 
water was broken by a few is- 
lands on the far horizon to the 
right. 

“Hesperides,” said C’mell, fol- 
lowing the direction of his gaze. 
“They came up from the sea 
when the Daimoni built this for 
us. For people, I mean. I 
shouldn’t say ‘us’ when I mean 
people.”

GALAXY 



T Te did not notice the correc- 
"*■ tion. He stared at the sea. 
Little specks were moving in it, 
very slowly. He pointed at one 
of them with his finger and 
asked C’mell: 

“Are those wethouses?” 
“What did you call them?” 
“Houses which are wet. 
Houses which sit on water. Are 
those some of them?” 

“Ships,” she said, not spoiling 
his fun with a direct contradic- 
tion. “Yes, those are ships.” 
“Ships?” he cried. “You’d 
never get one of those into 
space! Why call them ships 
then?” 

Very gently C’mell explained, 
“People had ships for water be- 
fore they had ships for space. I 
think the Old Common Tongue 
takes the word for space vessel 
from the things you are looking 
at.” 

“I want to see a city,” said 
Rod. “Show me a city.” 

“It won’t look like much from 
here. We’re too high up. Noth- 
ing looks like much from the 



top of Earthport. But I can 
show you, anyhow. Come over 
here, dear.” 

When they walked away from 
the edge, Rod realized that the 
little monkey was still with 
them. “What are you doing here 
with us?” asked Rod, not un- 
kindly. 

The monkey’s preposterous 
little face wrinkled into a know- 
ing smile. The face was the same 
as it had been before, but the 
expression was different — more 
assured, more clear, more pur- 
poseful than ever before. There 
was even humor and cordiality 
in the monkey’s voice. “We ani- 
mals are waiting for the people 
to finish their entrance.” 

We animals? thought Rod. 
Then he remembered his furry 
head, his pointed ears, his cat- 
whiskers. No wonder he felt at 
ease with this girl and she with 
him. 

The ten Rod McBans were 
walking down a ramp, so that 
the floor seemed to be swallow- 
ing them slowly from the feet

up. They were walking in single 
file, so that the head of the lead- 
ing one seemed to sit bodiless 
on the floor, while the last one 
in line had lost nothing more 
than his feet. It was odd indeed. 

Rod looked at C’mell and 
A’gentur and asked them frank- 
ly, “When people have such a 
wide, wet, beautiful world, all 
full of life, why should they kill 
me?” 

A’gentur shook his monkey 
head sadly, as though he knew 
full well, but found the telling 
of it inexpressibly wearisome. 

C’mell answered, “You are 
who you are. You hold immense 
power. Do you know that this 
tower is yours?” 

“Mine!” he cried. 

“You’ve bought it, or some- 
body bought it for you. Most of 
that water is yours, too. When 
you have things that big, people 
ask you for things. Or they' take 
them from you. Earth is a beau- 
tiful place, but I think it is a 
dangerous place, too, for off- 
worlders like you who are used 
to just one way of life. You 
haven’t caused all the crime and 
meanness in the world, but it’s 
• been sleeping. And now it wakes 
up for you.” 

“Why for me?” 

“Because,” said A’gentur, 
“you’re the richest person who 
has ever touched this planet. 
You own most of it already. 



Millions of human lives depend 
on your thoughts and your de- 
cisions.” 

They had reached the oppo- 
site side of the top platform. 
Here, on the land side, the riv- 
ers were all leaking badly. Most 
of the land was covered with 
steam-clouds, such as they saw 
on Norstrilia when a covered 
canal burst out of its covering. 
These clouds represented incal- 
culable treasures of rain. He 
saw that they parted at the foot 
of the tower. 

“Weather machines,” said 
C’mell. “The cities are all cov- 
ered with weather machines. 
Don’t you have weather ma- 
chines in Old North Australia?” 

“Of course we do,” said Rod, 
“but we don’t waste water by 
letting it float around in the 
open air like that. It’s pretty, 
though. I guess the extravagance 
of it makes me feel critical. 
Don’t you Earth people have 
anything better to do with your 
water than to leave it lying on 
the ground or having it float 
over open land?” 

“We’re not Earth people,” 
said C’mell. “We’re underpeo- 
ple. I’m a cat-person and he’s 
made from apes. Don’t call us 
people. It’s not decent.” 

“Fudge!” said Rod. “I was 
just asking a question about 
Earth, not pestering your feel- 
ings when — ”

He stopped short. 

They all three spun around. 

A man faced them — a tall 
man, clad in formal garments, 
his face gleaming with intelli- 
gence, courage, wisdom and a 
very special kind of elegance.

am projecting,” said he. 

“You know me,” he said to 
C’mell. 

“My lord Jestocost!” 

“You will sleep,” he com- 
manded A’gentur, and the little 
monkey crumpled into a heap 
of fur on the deck of the tower. 

“I am the Lord Jestocost, one 
of the Instrumentality,” said the 
strange man, “and I am going 
to speak to you at very high 
speed. It will seem like many 
minutes, but it will only take 
seconds. It is necessary for you 
to know your fate.” 

“You mean my future?” said 
Rod McBan. “I thought that 
you, or somebody else, had it all 
arranged.” 

“We can dispose, but we can- 
not arrange. I have talked to the 
Lord Redlady. I have plans for 
you. Perhaps they will work 
out.” 

A slight frowning smile crossed 
the face of the distinguished 
man. With his left hand he 
warned C’mell to do nothing. 
The beautiful cat-girl started to 



step forward and then obeyed 
the imperious gesture, stopped, 
and merely watched. 

The Lord Jestocost dropped to 
one knee. He bowed proudly and 
freely, with his head held high 
and his face tilted upward while 
he stared directly at Rod McBan. 

Still kneeling, he said cere- 
moniously, “Some day, young 
man, you will understand what 
you are now seeing. The Lord 
Jestocost, which is myself, has 
bowed to no man or woman 
since the day of his initiation. 
That was more time ago than 
I like to remember. But I bow 
freely to the man who has 
bought Earth. I offer you my 
friendship and my help. I offer 
both of these without mental 
reservation. Now I stand up and 
I greet you as my younger com- 
rade.” 

He stood erect and reached 
for Rod’s hand. Rod shook hands 
with him, still bewildered. 

“Within minutes assassins will 
be on their way to kill your im- 
personators. Other people will 
try to hunt you down for what 
you have done or for what you 
are. I am willing for you to save 
some of your property and all 
of your life. You will have ex- 
periences which you will treas- 
ure — if you live through them. 

“You have no chance at all 
without me. I’ll correct that. 
You have one chance in ten

thousand of coming out alive. 

“With me, if you obey me 
through C’mell, your chances 
are very good indeed. More than 
one thousand to one in your fa- 
vor. You will live — ” 

“But my money!” Rod 
spieked wildly without knowing 
that he did it. 

“Your money is on Earth. It 
is Earth,” smiled the wise, 
powerful old official. “It is being 
taxed at enormous rates. This 
is your fate, young man. Re- 
member it, and be ready to obey 
it. When I lift my hand, repeat 
after me. Do you understand?” 

Rod nodded. He was not 
afraid, exactly, but some un- 
known core within him had be- 
gun to radiate animal terror. 
He was not afraid of what might 
happen to himself; he was afraid 
of the strange, wild fierceness 
of it all. He had never known 
that man or boy could be so 
utterly alone. 

The loneliness of the open 
outback at home was physical. 
This loneliness had millions of 
people around him. He felt the 
past crowding up as though it 
were alive in its own right. The 
cat-girl beside him comforted 
him a little; he had met her 
through Doctor Vomact; to Vo- 
mact he had been sent by Red- 
lady; and Redlady knew his own 
dear home. The linkage was 
there, though it was remote. 



In front of him there was no 
linkage at all. 

Tie stood, in his own mind, on 
a precipice of the present, 
staring down at the complex in- 
explicable immensity of Earth’s 
past. This was the place that all 
people were from. In those 
oceans thty had crawled in the 
slime; from those salt, rich seas 
they had climbed to that land 
far below him; on that land they 
had changed from animals into 
men before they had seized the 
stars. This was home itself, the 
home of all men, and it could 
swallow him up. 

The word-thoughts came fast 
out of the Lord Jestocost’s mind, 
directly into his own. It was as 
though Jestocost had found some 
way around his impediment and 
had then disregarded it. 

“This is Old Earth Itself, from 
which you were bred and to 
which all men return in their 
thoughts if not in their bodies. 
This is still the richest of the 
worlds, though its wealth is 
measured in treasures and mem- 
ories, not in stroon. 

“Many men have tried to rule 
this world. A very few have done 
it for a little while.” 

Unexpectedly, the Lord Jesto- 
cost lifted his right hand. With- 
out knowing why he did it. Rod 
repeated the last sentence. 

“A very few men have govern- 



104 



GALAXY 



ed the world for a little while." 

“The Instrumentality has 
made that impossible.” 

The right hand was still in 
the commanding “up” position, 
so Red repeated, “The Instru- 
mentality has made that impos- 
sible.” 

“And now you, Rod McBan 
of Old North Australia, are the 
first to own it.” 

The hand was still raised. 

“And now I, Rod McBan, of 
Old North Australia, am the 
first to own it.” 

The hand dropped, but the 
Lord spieked on. 

“Go forward, then, with death 
around you. 

“Go forward, then, to your 
heart’s desire. 

“Go forward, with the love 
you will win and lose. 



“Go forward, to the world, and 
to that other world under the 
world. 

“Go forward, to wild adven- 
tures and a safe return. 

“Be watchful of C’mell. She 
will be my eyes upon you, my 
arm around your shoulders, my . 
authority upon your person; but 
go. 

“Go.” Up went the hand. 

“Go . ” said Rod. 

The Lord vanished. 

C’mell plucked at his sleeve. 
“Your trip is over, my husband. 
Now we take Earth itself.” 

Softly and quickly they ran 
to the steps which went to un- 
imaginable Earth below them. 

Rod McBan had come to the 
fulfilment of his chance and his 
inheritance.

This lovely flyway between Los Angeles and Old Nueva York is 
among the most picturesque of Earth's planetary routes. From East to 
West one retraces the steps of the early Sodbusters, or Okies, following 
the vanishing herds of buffalo toward That Great Gold Strike in Holly- 
wood. From West to East one partially follows the path of the Annihilation 
Eclipse of '99. Rich in historical associations, superb in its natural beauties. 
Earth Eighteen is justly famed as a pleasant and inexpensive vacation tour 
for those whose budgets do not permit something better.

O km, Earth 18 begins at the 
ancient village of El Pueblo de 
Nuestra Senora la Reina de Los 
Angeles, once the largest (in 
area) community on this con- 
tinent and now a settlement of 
some 1000 human beings ad- 
ministered as a Vegan naval 
base under the Treaty of Capel- 
la XV. At the time of the Occu- 
pation of Earth elaborate de- 
fense works were constructed by 
the natives, which, however, 
failed in their purpose and are 
now used by the Vegans for 
training exercises in the demol- 
ishment of defense positions. 
Little now remains of this once 
mighty system of walls and forti- 
fications, known locally as Free- 
ways. However, even less re- 
mains of the people who built 
them. 

A number of side trips are 
available, which the discerning 
traveler will avoid. 

4 km w., on local route Wilshire 
Boulevard, the La Brea Tar Pits, 
app. 10 hectare tract of Pleistocene 
asphalt beds, part of a sedimentary 
series of sands, clays and gravel, 
present thickness estimated at from 
10 to 50 meters. In the geologic past 
these beds comprised open tar seeps, 
perhaps with a thin film of water 
as a surface feature, attracting thirs- 
ty fauna. These became entrapped 
in the tar and attracted carnivores 



to prey on them, which in turn be- 
came entrapped and attracted later 
forms as spectators, chewing-gum 
vendors and purveyors of picture 
post cards. Among the species repre- 
sented in the tar are dire wolves, sa- 
ber-tooth tigers and mastodons, which 
are extinct, and dogs, cats and hu- 
man beings, which are not, quite. 




46 km. s.e., on local route JJ, is 
Disneyland, inhabited by American 
Indians, early rocket men, cowboys, 
“bank robbers” and other primi- 
tive forms, none of which are alive.

324 km. Hoover Desert. This 
great dust bowl, which must be 
approached with respirators, is 
an awe-inspiring sight. Named 
after a mythical early hero (cf. 
Hooverville, Hoovertown, Hoov- 
er Vacuum Cleaner, etc.), the 
name refers to anything which 
is shabby or in need of clean- 
ing, hence this massive ruin. 
More than 500 meters in length 
and bone dry, it was at one time 
a mighty reservoir conserving 
the waters of the Colorado Riv- 
er until residents of the State 
of Arizona, angered because of 
what they deemed an unfair di- 
vision of its waters, crept to the 
base of the dam one night and 
left its faucets running. 

489 km. Grand Canyon, 360 
km long and nearly 30 km in 
width at some points, has been 
compared in size and beauty 
with the Polar Chasm of Alde- 
baran XVIII, but not, however, 
by those who have visited Alde- 
baran XVIII. Along its sharply 
eroded walls can be seen rock 
strata going back nearly one 
billion local years, ranging from 
pre- Cambrian schists and gneis- 
as Coca-Cola bottle tops and 
ses, lacking in any fossil re- 
mains, through Cambrian, De- 
vonian, Mississippian and Per- 
mian layers, to recent deposits 
rich in archeological finds such 



bumed-out picture tubes. 

Exploring the lower portion 
of the Canyon afoot or atentacle 
is a pleasant diversion for visi- 
tors who do not expect too much. 
The natives can provide pack 
animals for those who wish to 
venture down the old rock trails 
to the bottom of the chasm, 
where desert plants like agave 
and Spanish bayonet flourish. 
The pack animals are strong, 
agile and specially bred for this 
arduous work, but cannot be re- 
lied upon for transport of visi- 
tors weighing more than 120 kg. 
For heavier visitors quadrupeds, 
such as “horses” or “mules”, are 
available. 

The lower portion of the Co- 
conino Plateau, forming the south 
rim of the Canyon, is off-limits 
to all visitors lacking protective 
armor or weapons of defense. 
These areas have been colonized 
by Lesser Betelgeusan Chamel- 
ions which, masked as boulders 
or tree-stumps, lie in wait for 
their prey beside the trails. 

677 km. Wupatld National 
Monument. This spot has a rich 
and fascinating history. Unfor- 
tunately none of it is known. 

146 km n. on Planetary Route 
356 may be seen the sites of the for- 
mer Navajo Cliff Dwellings, now a 
flat and featureless desert. Their ap- 
pearance dates from Local Year

At 1088 km the flyway passes 
s. of Mt. Taylor (3400 meters), 
a peak of the Rocky Mountain 
chain. Care must be taken in 
passing this point, as the snow- 
capped peak visible to the south 
Is not a mountain but a Greater 
Betelgeusan Chamelion.

At 1204 km, by bringing your 
floatcraft above 400 meters you 
may be fortunate enough to see 
southward a muddy trickle wend- 
ing its feeble way along what 
what was at one time the border 
between the provinces of Mexico 
and Usa. Shallow, narrow and 
seasonally unreliable, this stream 
was known derisively to the na- 
tives as “The Big River” or Rio 
Grande. 



1482 km. The Carlsbad Cav- 
erns. At this point the flyway 
passes over what is almost the 
last surviving preserve of native 
life in its pre- Contact form. In 
this underground empire, more 
than 60 km of connecting cham- 
bers and passages are known to 
exist, some of which reach a 
length of nearly a kilometer and 
a ceiling height of some 85 
meters. Formed some 60,000,000 
local years ago by water erosion 
in beds of gypsum and limestone, 
in 1995 the Caverns were oc- 
cupied by refugees fearing nu- 
clear holocaust and, sustained 
by primitive forms of food-syn- 
thesizers, water recirculators, 
etc., they have remained there 
ever since. 

The area has been declared a 
Galactic Game Refuge, and no 
visitors are permitted to enter 
the Caverns except when ac- 
companied by a licensed galactic 

GALAXY 



guide and equipped with no-see 
invisibility shields, sound damp- 
ers, etc. Permits may be obtain- 
ed from the Park Director for 
the guided tour. Qualified aca- 
demic or government personnel 
may secure authorization for un- 
conducted visits, including the 
privilege of visiting sections of 
the Caverns not normally in- 
cluded in the tour and the right 
to take specimens, but this must 
be arranged in writing in ad- 
vance. 

The Earth colony in the Cav- 
erns comprises nearly 1500 adult 
population and, although the 
census of recent years has shown 
some decline in the number of 
young born each spring, it is ex- 
pected that it will stabilize at a 
figure in excess of 1,000. The 
natives are bellicose and im- 
bued with a mystique they call 
“Massive Retaliation”. Much of 
their religious activity centers 
around an annual war dance 
and role-playing ceremony in 
which chosen heroes known as 
the Teller (or Good One) and 
the Pauling (or Evil One) con- 
tend in mock combat to decide 
whether or not to “Press the 
Button.” By convention the 
Teller always wins but in a 
richly symbolic ceremony is 
prevented from “pressing the 
button” by a horde of masked 
assassins in a rite known as 



“civilian interference with stra- 
tegic concepts.” The “button” 
may at one time have had some 
relation to actual weapons, but 
all such have of course long since 
been disarmed or removed by 
Sirian teams of engineers. The 
homes are principally carved 
out of the rock, although some 
attempt has been made to erect 
huts in the larger chambers, 
where the tribal life retains 




more of its original vitality, the 
women cooking and caring for 
the children while the men fol- 
low their traditional occupations 
of cave-bat hunting and televi- 
sion repair. 

Of recent years there has been 
much debate as to the ultimate 
fate of this colony in the halls of 
the Protectorate Council, some 
factions proposing to tell them 
that the war is over and return 
them to the surface, the more 
conservative element advocating 
retaining them as they are. It 
is considered likely that the 
latter view will prevail, at least 
as long as the planet continues 
to produce an adequate supply 
of other protein.

2473 km. Houston, although 
pleasantly located, is not recom- 
mended for more than a short 
visit because of the unpleasant 
odor of a native hydrocarbon 
compound. Once used as fuel, 
“oil”, as it is called, invades the 
drinking water, the air and the 
conversation of the locals, who 
firmly believe it will once again 
have value and attempt to trade 
“leases” to travellers in exchange 
for chocolate bars or bits of 
colored glass. 




2576 km. At Galveston at low 
tide may be seen the rusting re- 
mains of the Nuclear Ship Sa- 
vannah, one of the earliest 
atomic- powered surface craft 
built on Earth. Local tradition 
holds that its engines, driven by 
“kobalds” or “gobs” under the 
direction of a legendary figure 
named Rickover, never needed 
refueling. Ritual caste differ- 
ences between “locals” at the 
time of launching made it im- 
possible to secure a crew and the 
vessel never put to sea, so indeed 
they never did. 



3132 km. Here the flyway 
passes over the open sea for a 
distance of some 1500 km where, 
just s. of the Mississippi River 
Delta, is Gulfhaven, a modern 
resort for aquatic forms, equip- 
ped with pressure rooms, steam 
generators, whirligons, etc. Gulf- 
haven is unique among Earth 
Eighteen’s tourist attractions in 
that its administration and fi- 
nancing is 100 per cent Terres- 
trial controlled, as a Point 99 
Project sponsored jointly by 
groups from Saiph III and the 
Procyon system after the Occu- 
pation of Earth. Actual construc- 
tion, of course, was accomplished 
by imported machinery, mostly 
from Rigel VI. Among the re- 
sort’s many forms of amusement 
and sports are swimming, float- 
ing, diving, writhing, soaking, 
flowing and glunt. 

The natives are intelligent, co- 
operative and cultured. They 
are not to be confused with the 
biped land form with whom they 
once contended for the domina- 
tion of the planet. Aquatic but 
air-breathing, the Terrestrials of 
Gulfhaven are known locally as 
“dolphins.”

4145 km. Amphibian forma 
may relish a stopover at The 
Everglades, a tract of some 5,000 
square km of swamp, forest, 
marsh and waterways. Abound- 
ing in game of every variety, The 
Everglades have been described 
as a hunter’s paradise, where 
limit bags may be taken of bear, 
otter, deer, white-banded teal, 
human beings, white and blue 
herons, panthers, bullfrogs, 
manatees, brown mallard, duck, 
roseate spoonbill, alligators, 
Cape Sable seaside sparrows and 
snakes. Sea trout, tarpon, chan- 
nel bass and other marine verte- 
brates tempt aquatic forms. All 
in all, The Everglades have con- 
siderable local renown as a first- 
rate place for a picnic for al- 
most any traveller, and their at- 
tractions have been enhanced 
by a vigorous building program 
on the part of Park authorities, 
including game areas, hostels 
and barbecue pits, with native 
servants to clean away any un- 
tidy remnants. 

[CAUTION:/ 

These 

human beings may not be taken 
on your Transient Hunting Li- 
cense. Please cooperate with the

are hard to replace. If you in- 
advertently take one of them 
you must report it at once to the 
Park Director and pay a fair 
price per kilogram of dressed 
weight. 

4267 km. In Miami Beach 
simple accommodations may be 
obtained for a few “pennies” in 
local currency at establishments 
such as the Eden Roc or Fon- 
tainebleau. Southern Florida is 
subtropical in climate (273°- 
288° A.) and displays many 
lovely flowering plants, none of 
them native. Those interested in 
geology will find the eastern 
coast somewhat elevated over the 
west as the weight of the Gulf 
of Mexico depressed the western 
strata, thus displaying more 
ancient rock formations on the 
eastern side. At Bradenton (128 
km nnw.) may be seen the rust- 
ing remains of the hydraulic 
jacks built in 1983, when a 9th 
District “congressman” fought 
through a large federal appro- 
priation to combat this geologi- 
cal shift and “set the damn thing 
straight again.” 




4591 km. Now a National Park, 
the former site of Cape Canav- 
eral is rich in local historical 
interest. The people are friend- 
ly, provided one purchases sou- 
venirs. The males are tall, wear 
soft caps and speak a curious 
local argot. The women do not 
show themselves in the presence 
of strangers. An interesting feat- 
ure of the Canaveral dialect is 
their unique numbering system, 
which' goes, “Five, four, three, 
two, one, oh, curse it all!” The 
most prominent local feature is 
a pylon of dressed stone 35 
meters high, representing a 
primitive rocket missile and 
known locally as “the NASA 
totem” after the initials of the 
National- Arbeiter Sozialistische 
Aktion, the group which first 
sponsored rocket research. 




Manny’s, a beach club, provides 
box lunches for travelers and a sim- 
ple dinner on the premises for those 
who wish to lunch while overlooking 
the rusted gantries. A local delicacy 
is smoked salmon, which has a com- 
plex religious significance for the 
natives under its name of “lox.”

4922 km. Brunswick, Georgia, 
the site of the first invasion 
from the sea by Vegan marine 
forces during the Occupation of 
Earth, is now noted principally 
for its series of rolling sand 
dunes extending n. and s. as far 
as the eye can reach. Here 
Vegan amphitanks, advancing 
from staging areas just off the 
Continental Shelf, rolled inland 
in waves of a thousand or more 
tanks, beaming individual tar- 
gets with lasers and mortaring 
tactical nuclear shells in a creep- 
ing barrage that preceded them 
as they advanced. The aborigi- 
nal population was wiped out 
entirely. One Vegan was a cas- 
ualty, having sprained a fluke in 
a collision between his amphi- 
tank and a landing triphib as- 
sault craft. As a sightseeing ob- 
ject Brunswick is something of 
a disappointment, since there is 
essentially nothing left to see, 
but that’s a Vegan invasion for 
you. 



A side trip to Atlanta (426 km

ghost town, now inhabited by only 
a few small quadrupeds and great

ered a major human-being commun-

a regional capital. Modeled after 
Greek sources — that is to say, with 
a pleasure-bent aristocracy subsisting

on the toil of slaves — it was thus d©- 
rogatorily referred to as “The Ath- 
ens of the South.” Here the Vegan 
drive culminated with the burning 
of the city, an event which is com- 
memorated in the doleful native folk

5543 km. Washington. Muggy, 
miasmic and malarious, the cli- 
mate of this former provincial 
capital is such that stopovers are 
not recommended in the months 
of May through October or De- 
cember through March. It is at 
its best, if best is the right word, 
in April and November, when 
it is unpleasant. The men are tall, 
indolent and gloomy, with bushy 
eyebrows. The women nag the 
men. The quaint name of the 
town comes from the folk belief 
that at one time this area was 
inhabited by countless “govern- 
ment workers” who proliferated 
until their natural increase came 
to a halt because of the destruc- 
tion of their grazing grounds. It 
was said that they survived by 
the taking in of one another’s 
washing (cf, 9007 Terrestrial 
Folk Sayings, by I. Asenion), 
hence the description of the 
place as “washing done.”

as standing armies and “a multi- 
tude of new offices, and . 
swarms of officers [who] harass 
our people and eat out their sub-

5946 km. Old Nueva York. 
This broad bay where the Hud- 
son River meets the Atlantic 
Ocean is thought to have been 
the site of a large city at one 
time. Legends give various rea- 
sons for its disappearance. Held 
to have been “the money center 
of the world”, some theories 
state that with the abolition of 
money due to the growth of 
credit cards, its purpose ceased 
to exist and it was plowed under 
in a ritual sacrifice to propitiate 
evil spirits and bring back “the 
good old days.” (Cf. the Agricul- 
tural Adjustment Administra- 
tion, etc.) An alternate legend 
tells of a time of building 
mighty monoliths in ceremonies 
known in other primitive com- 
munities as “potlatching”, 
where one tribe, the RCAs, con- 
spicuously consumed their 



wealth in erecting a huge struc- 
ture, to be matched by another 
tribe, the Pan-Ams, etc. Accord- 
ing to this folk-tale the founda- 
tions of the island simply could 
not support its superstructure 




and it turned over and disap- 
peared in the sea. A third legend, 
that the city was obliterated in 
a nuclear conflict, has been con- 
clusively disproved by phase- 
analysis methods based on a 
study of human psychological 
traits as reconstructed from sur- 
viving documents. Clearly they 
were crazy, but no race could be 
that crazy. 

In any event, the site at pres- 
ent comprises a broad, clear bay 
surrounded by pleasant woods 
and savannas. As the bay is of 
deep water and offers shelter 
for vessels it was once contem- 
plated that a trading center be 
established there, but the project 
was given up when it was real- 
ized there was nothing on Earth 
worth trading for.

65 km e. on local route Northern 
State Boulevard is Levittown, a sur-

awash at high tide. A few of the 
structures are of traditional local 
interest, as the home at the corner 




ot Alexanderplatz Drive and Les 
Champs Elysees du Ouest. This 
building is tabu to the natives, who 
held that in its early history it was 
the subject of a shameful violation of 
folkways, since it was purchased for

parts, locally termed the “American” 
and the “Canadian” falls, over which 
an aggregate of some 450,000 cubic 
meters of water pass each minute, 
descending an average distance of 
50 meters. That is all there is to it. 
It hardly seems enough.

by local irregulars under Joe McCar- 
thy, who according to tradition part- 
ed the waters with a birch rod and 
thus stranded the invasion fleet. The 
spot is marked by a monolith known 
as Plymouth Rock, or Wreck.

The transfluvian tribes are

eked out their grazing economy 
by decoying floatcraft into land-

robbed and sometimes killed by 
the native weapon, a sort of

GALTON’S RANDOM 
MACHINE, THE BEAN 
CURVE AND MILITARY 
PURCHASES 

S ir Francis Gal ton, who died 
in 1911 just one month be- 
fore reaching the age of 89, was 
one of the important scientists 
of the latter part of the nine- 
teenth century even though his 
name is not very well known 
any more. 



120 



He was bom in Birmingham 
in 1822. By the time little Fran- 
cis received his first lessons, one 
of his cousins who was thirteen 
years older studied for the min- 
istry and passed his spare time 
as an enthusiastic collector of 
English beetles. The name of 
the beetle-collecting cousin was 
Charles Darwin; the grandfa- 
ther of them both was Dr. Eras- 
mus Darwin. By the time 
Charles Darwin went on a voy- 
age around the world on the 
H.M.S. Beagle, instead of 
mounting the pulpit, Francis 
Galton was at Trinity College, 
Cambridge studying anthropol- 
ogy. At the age of 23 he went 
travelling too, first to the Sudan, 
then to South-West Africa. Af- 
ter his return he first wrote 
about his travels and then turn- 
ed to the study of meteorology. 
His Meteorographica (1863) was 
one of the first comprehensive 
books on the then new science 
of weather research. 

That he did not stick to mete- 
orology but changed course once 
more was the fault of his cousin. 

Charles Darwin’s Origin of 
Species had been published in 
1859. Galton read it, of course, 
and realized that here was a 
whole collection of new fields 
and that Darwin, thorough as he 
had been, had not been able to 
cover everything. Therefore he 
began to work in a few of these 




Gallon's "Random Machine" 

peripheral fields. 

He became especially interest- 
ed in heredity as applied to hu- 
mans, and began statistical 
studies of hereditary traits. His 
studies involved the results of 
inheritance in certain families, 
but also of people who were not 
related but had something in 
common — for example genius, 
or color blindness, or a criminal 
record. The last subdivision led 
him to fingerprints, about which 
he wrote several books.

The distribution of 442 beans picked at random. Upper line 
gives length in millimeters, lower line tht number of beans. 



T T eredity was understood in 
-*■ Galton’s time, to the extent 
that it had been noticed that 
both parents passed on traits to 
their children, and that some 
traits were pronounced while 
others seemed to disappear. But 
it was also known that traits 
sometimes jumped across one 
generation. His own famous 
grandfather and famous grand- 
son, Charles Darwin, were one 
example. The Mendelssohn fam- 
ily in Berlin was another one, 
where the (middle) member, the 
banker Abraham Mendelssohn, 
remarked that it was tough to 
be the son and the father of fa- 



mous men. (His father had been 
the famous Jewish philosopher 
Moses Mendelssohn, his son was 
the composer Felix Mendels- 
sohn-Bartholdy.) But the ex- 
tremes, genius on the one side 
and idiocy on the other, were 
rare. The majority was in the 
middle. 

One day Galton constructed, 
presumably for purposes of 
demonstration, a device which 
he called the Random Machine. 
(See Fig. 1.) It consisted of a 
funnel-like metal strip, mount- 
ed on a board. Below the funnel 
mouth were a large number of 
evenly distributed brads, and be- 



122 



GALAXY 



low them a number of vertical 
slots. The front of the whole was 
covered by a pane of glass. The 
top was open so that the experi- 
menter could drop small steel 
balls into the funnel. The steel 
ball would roll down one of the 
slopes and then bounce its way 
through the row of brads. Finally 
it would end up in one of the 
slots. 

It was impossible to tell in 
advance in which slot the ball 
would end up. But if a large 
number, at least a hundred, balls 
were used, the center slots would 
receive more of them, and the 
final distribution of the balls in 
the slots would always show a 
curve, highest in the center, and 
sloping down on both sides. Nor 
did it matter whether the balls 
were fed into the machine one 
by one in succession, or were 
thrown in by the handful. The 
result was always the same. 

Thoroughness compels me to 
record that Galton’s device was 
also used for an unscientific 
purpose — namely that of some 
genteel gambling at home. All 
one had to do was to number 
the slots and to make bets 
whether the next ball would end 
up in slot number 3 or number 
7. Or else one could bet that 
none of the first fifty balls 
would find its way into slot 
number 1. One enterprising 
character, name unknown, man- 



ufactured the device and mar- 
keted it “for family entertain- 
ment” under the name of Tivoli. 

Now Galton’s device worked 
with identical objects which un- 
derwent different events; that 
is, they had collided with differ- 
ent brads in different positions. 
This reflected the random events 
that mix traits (nowadays we 
would say “genes”) in heredity. 
But then this was extended to 
objects which were different be- 
cause the random events of he- 
redity had already happened to 
them. 

A group of German researchers 
bought a few pounds of dry 
beans in the farmer’s market 
and spent a few afternoons 
measuring them. The beans 
were all of the same botanical 
species, but some of them were, 
of course, larger than others. 

In this case the largest bean 
happened to be just twice as 
long as the smallest. A rack of 
chemical test tubes was pressed 
into service as a receiver. It was 
dubbed the “bean harp”, since 
the row of vertical tubes re- 
minded somebody with musical 
inclinations and some imagina- 
tion of the strings of a harp. The 
largest bean went into test tube 
number 9, the smallest into test 
tube number 1; and the overall 
result of the sorting can be seen 
in Fig. 2. It was the same kind 
of curve.

The military, especially the 
Quartermaster Corps, became 
interested. If beans had such a 
definite curve showing the aver- 
age numbers of beans of each 
size, that might apply to soldiers 
too — or rather to their uni- 
forms and boots. Of course peo- 
ple differed far more from each 
other than did beans. Still it 
could do no harm to let a 
mathematician play around for 
some time with statistics of mili- 
tary inventories.

ade before the outbreak of World

War I. It may also be added 
that the mathematicians were 
disdainful of the biologists’ 
term “bean curve” and at once 
talked about Gaussian curves. 

In the meantime Swedish re- 
searchers had extended the bean 
curve to humans, or the most 
typically human part of them, 
namely the brain. In the course 
of autopsies made for all kinds 
of reasons the brain weights 
were noted. The comparison by 
weight of the brains of 350 Scan- 
dinavian males gave the curve 
in Fig. 3. (If there had been 
three times as many autopsies 
the actual curve would have

fitted the theoretical curve bet 
ter than was the case.) 

Some fifty years ago zoologists 
and biologists were quite happy 
with the “bean curve” as applied 
to animals and to certain parts 
of plants, especially their seeds. 
The curve was always useful in 
predicting the probable number 
of individuals of a certain size 
in an animal population. To 
make the curve work, two items 
had to be established, the more 
important of them being the 
location of the center line — 
that is, the size represented in 
the largest number of individ- 
uals. The less important item is 
to establish the actual ends of 
the curve. In the beans first used 
the largest had been 16 milli- 
meters long, the smallest 8 milli- 
meters. If a million beans had 



been measured the largest might 
have been, say, 20 millimeters 
and the smallest 6 millimeters. 
But these would be the practical 
limits. Even ten million beans 
would not yield one 200 milli- 
meters (about 8 inches) long. 
They simply do not exist — even 
though the curve, written as an 
equation, might say that there 
should be one 200-millimeter 
bean in every ten or fifteen mil- 
lion. 

Prior to World War I no 
practical conclusions were based 
on the bean curve, under what- 
ever name. The reason probably 
was that private individuals still 
had their garments made to 
measure, while the military 
could set artificial limits and 
accept as draftees or volunteers 
only men of arbitrarily set min-

imum and maximum heights and 
sizes. 

But after the first World War 
such studies, for the very prac- 
tical purpose of military pur- 
chases of uniforms, underwear, 
socks and boots, were started. 
Fig. 4 shows the curve for 1000 
American soldiers, a random 
group picked in 1922. The cen- 
ter line then was 5 feet 7 inches, 
represented by 157 men. One 
inch shorter was represented by 
136 men and one inch taller by 
138 men. The size range from 
5 feet 5 inches to 5 feet 10 inches 
comprised 740 men — very 
nearly three-quarters of the 1000 
soldiers fell into that size range. 

It is easy to understand how 
a knowledge of these facts will 
influence decisions on military 
purchases. 

Of course, this curve of the 
year 1922 no longer applies lit- 
erally. People have grown since 
then and by now the center line 
may be 5 feet 8 inches instead 
of 5 fet 7 inches. Likewise the 
center line of the curve will 
vary with nationality. If I had 
actual statistics I would expect 
quite different center lines for 
the British army, the French 
army and the Japanese army. 

But the curve itself would 
apply in every army, just with a 
different center line and differ- 
ent cutoff points — which, of 
course, could be arbitrary. 



/^Af course statistics can go both 
ways. Actually helmets come 
in just three sizes, small, medi- 
um and large. But if some army 
wished to issue precisely fitting 
helmets it could derive its fig- 
ures from the statistics of the 
number of different hat sizes 
purchased by the civilian popu- 
lation. These statistics may be 
misleading at the extreme ends; 
men with unusually large heads 
(like me) usually have so much 
trouble getting their size that 
they stop wearing hats except 
in very bad weather. The result 
is that the sales statistics do not 
properly express the distribu- 
tion of hat sizes. 

And when I lived in Washing- 
ton during the second World 
War, I heard another story of 
statistics that miscarried. The 
Women’s Army Corps had been 
formed and they needed shoes, of 
course. Purchases were made in 
accordance with the statistics 
supplied by manufacturers of 
women’s shoes, and it turned 
out that they had bought too 
many small sizes. Because the 
manufacturer’s statistics were, 
naturally, based on sales volume 
. and in this case the sales 
volumes did not reflect the dis- 
tribution of foot size! 

But aside from such compara- 
tively minor exceptions the 
bean curve is a useful statistical 
device. —WILLY LEY

THE END OF THE RACE 



It was a triumph of international 
diplomacy — a triumph over sensei 



by ALBERT BERMEL 



\ t that time the nations 
-* known as America and 
Russia had set off 2,500 nuclear 
explosions, pulverized every 
small island in the Pacific, Arc- 
tic and Indian Oceans, blown 
out of the earth lumps of great 
magnitude and little mineralog- 
ical value, and saturated the en- 
closing atmosphere and strato- 
sphere with new elements, from 
Strontium-90 to Neptunium-237. 
It was then that the American 
Secretary of State and the Rus- 
sian Foreign Minister pointed 
out to their respective leaders 
that the “tests,” as these detona- 
tions were popularly called, had 
not been successful. “By not suc- 
cessful,” the Secretary of State 



added, “I mean that we have 
failed to widen the gap.” 

“By not successful,” the For- 
eign Minister elaborated, “I 
mean that we have failed to wid- 
en the gap.” 

The leaders of both nations 
immediately called for a confer- 
ence and met near a beautiful 
lake in an intermediate country. 
Warmed by their consultations 
with eighty-proof bourbon and 
one-hundred-ten-proof vodka, 
they agreed that they would nei- 
ther widen the gap nor narrow 
it, but simply eliminate gaps 
once and for all. The Russian 
leader told the story of a Ukrain- 
ian peasant who loved to eat 
bacon, “but he was so fond of 



127 



his pig that he could not bring 
himself to kill it. He therefore 
swapped pigs with his neighbor.” 
The American leader replied: 
“We must not hesitate to make 
sacrifices and, as our scientists 
have repeatedly stated, we must 
not be afraid to think about the 
unthinkable.” 

The conversation continued in 
this vein for forty-five minutes. 
As a result, the leaders drew up 
the outline for a new treaty: 
they would each drop one med- 
ium-sized hydrogen bomb — 
with a 150-megaton yield — on- 
to the other’s home territory, or 
over it, whichever proved the 
more convenient. This co-opera- 
tive action would have two ad- 
vantages or, as the American 
leader expressed it, two consum- 
er benefits. Firstly, the impact 
of the explosions could be test- 
ed, not on thin air alone but 
also on people. Secondly, the 
two countries would be able to 
try out their civil defense pro- 
grams under genuine rather than 
simulated conditions. 

The American leader said, 
“This ought to deter certain of 
our citizens from sitting down 
in Times Square during drill 
time.” The Russian leader an- 
swered, ‘We allow nobody to sit 
down in Red Square at any 
time.” The two men then shook 
hands, paid handsome tribute to 
the country in which they had 



convened as a bastion of inter- 
national understanding, issued a 
cheerful communique which the 
news services somehow misin- 
terpreted and flew away, the 
American leader to his yacht, 
the Russian leader to his dacha. 

And it was then that the dis- 
agreements began. 

/^vver Aquavita-flavored tea 
(en verre) and highballs a 
la Philadelphia, the Russian 
Foreign Minister and the Ameri- 
can Secretary of State (with 
their Ambassadors to the United 
Nations in attendance) sat for 
twelve hours at an oval table in- 
laid with Mollweide’s projection 
of the world in five colors, to 
implement the details of the 
treaty by selecting a Russian and 
an American city as targets. The 
principal difficulty was that the 
cities must be equal in popula- 
tion and wealth — although, as 
the Foreign Minister observed, 
‘We should be prepared to give 
or take a few citizens in ex- 
change for a few hundred rou- 
bles.” 

There followed a number of 
fruitless comparisons between 
San Francisco and Kiev, Nijny- 
Novgorod and Detroit, Portland 
(Me.) and Archangel. The four 
men bent long over the Moll- 
weide projection and eventually 
arrived at a temporary compro- 
mise, London and Warsaw. Then 



128 



GALAXY 



they parted for the night and 
their hotels in order to telephone 
the respective shores of Florida 
and the Black Sea. 

The next morning they came 
together again with firm instruc- 
tions from home to abandon the 
temporary compromise. Over- 
night, the Presidential yacht had 
bidden its second-in-command 
to “stay within Soviet bounda- 
ries — but West of the Urals if 
humanly possible” and not to 
“sell America’s Polish vote down 
the Vistula.” The Chairman’s 
dacha, on the other hand, had 
begun his discourse with a folk 
tale about a canny peasant from 
the Ukraine who had succeeded 
in exchanging a sparrow (War- 
saw? London?) for a duck (Lon- 
don? Warsaw?), but the duck 
now had to be fed, whereas the 
sparrow had been capable of 
finding its own food and. 

On the word “and” the For- 
eign Minister had fallen asleep 
with the receiver at his ear. He 
had awakened thirty-five min- 
utes later, just in time to learn 
that the destruction of Warsaw 
would irrevocably lead to up- 
risings in Prague, Tirana, Sofia, 
Bucharest and — God help the 
Red Army — Budapest. The mes- 
sage ended: “Did nobody think 
of East and West Berlin? Alter- 
natively, the people of the Soviet 
Union would reluctantly have 
relinquished Peking for Lon- 



don, except that Das Kapital 
was written in the British Mu- 
seum, and the People’s Democ- 
racy of China almost certainly 
has its own atomic firecrackers 
and might retaliate.” 

After reshaping these com- 
munications in diplomatic term- 
inology, the Foreign Minister 
and the Secretary of State again 
took up their bargaining. 

To their surprise, and almost 
grudgingly, they came to terms 
within minutes. The American 
bomb would be dropped over 
Voronezh which, as the Secre- 
tary of State confided to his 
Ambassador, gave promising 
possibilities of fallout on Rostov, 
Dnepropetrovsk, Kursk, Khar- 
kov and Moscow. The Ambassa- 
dor studied Mollweide and saw 
that the Secretary was right. For 
Voronezh and its bonuses, the 
Secretary of State was more than 
willing to concede Columbus, 
Ohio, which, he explained, had 
long been considered a “test 
city” in a less conclusive sense 
by the American advertising 
community, as well as by sev- 
eral motivational research or- 
ganizations. So Voronezh-Colum- 
bus it was, and in good time for 
lunch. The two Ambassadors to 
the United Nations gratefully 
fastened their briefcases and 
talked about an afternoon swim 
in the neighboring lake. 

But during the caviar aux truf- 

129 



THE END OF THE RACE 



les the Foreign Minister looked 
thoughtful, and halfway through 
the wurst piemontaise he spoke 
a vehement Nyet and called an 
afternoon session. 

S adly the Ambassadors re- 
opened their briefcases at 
two p.m. The Foreign Minister 
now claimed — although he 
would not produce census fig- 
ures to prove it — that the popu- 
lation of Voronezh had swollen 
considerably under the latest 
ten-year industrial plan, and that 
Baltimore would be more near- 
ly equivalent than Columbus. 

The Secretary of State could 
not accept this demand, in view 
of the proximity of Baltimore to 
New York. (The American Am- 
bassador was momentarily sur- 
prised that his colleague had 
overlooked Washington, which 
was much closer). The Secretary 
then offered, in quick but un- 
successful succession : Atlanta, 

Little Rock (which the Foreign 
Minister rejected out of hand), 
New Orleans and Butte. 

The conference thereupon 
“deadlocked,” as most of the 
press reported. (By means of 
judicious leaks from two North- 
ern senators and one Russian 
general, the corps of correspond- 
ents had been led to believe that 
the conference was concerned 
with the exchange of American 
alfalfa for Russian millet.) 



That evening at a jazz concert 
in the Russian embassy the For- 
eign Minister was urged by his 
counterpart to relent, but in 
vain. The Secretary of State left 
early and lay inert on his hotel 
bed for over an hour, watching 
the pendulum of a cuckoo clock 
and wondering whether Balti- 
more and New York were worth 
the effort. 

Top-secret telephone messages 
went out that night to Biscayne 
Bay and the Crimean waters, 
and were meticulously tapped by 
two espionage organizations, the 
KGB and the CIA. The follow- 
ing morning the American and 
Russian leaders returned almost 
simultaneously on the same air- 
strip and paid immediate trib- 
ute to their host, this tiny coun- 
try from which the spirit of in- 
ternational good will irradiated 
the globe. Within an hour they 
had displayed the decisiveness 
for which both were famous, and 
had settled — that is, undead- 
locked — the conference with a 
new agreement of breathtaking 
simplicity. 

Russia would drop its own 
bomb on Moscow . and Ameri- 
ca would drop its own bomb on 
New York City. 

Thus, thanks to an astute com- 
bination of statesmanship and 
generosity, the long-feared Third 
World War never came to pass.

FINAL 

ENCOUNTER 



BY HARRY HARRISON 

ILLUSTRATED BY NODEL 

They had searched the galaxy 
for a fellow species . now 
there was nowhere left to go/ 



I 

T T autamaki had landed the 
-*■ ship on a rubble-covered pan 
of rock, a scored and ancient 
lava flow on the wrong side of 
the glacier. Tjond had thought, 
but only to herself, that they 
could have landed nearer; but 
Hautamaki was shipmaster and 
made all the decisions. Then 
again, she could have stayed 



with the ship. No one had forced 
her to join in this hideous 
scramble across the fissured ice. 
But of course staying behind 
was out of the question. 

There was a radio beacon of 
some kind over there — on this 
uninhabited planet — sending 
out squeals and cracklings on a 
dozen frequencies. She had to be 
there when they found it. 

Gulyas helped her over a dif- 



131 



ficult place and she rewarded 
him with a quick kiss on his 
windburned cheek. 

It was too much to hope that 
it could be anything other than 
a human beacon, though their 
ship was supposed to be cover- 
ing an unexplored area. Yet 
there was the slimmest chance 
that some others might have 
built the beacon. The thought of 
not being there at the time of a 
discovery like that was unbear- 
able. How long had mankind 
been looking now? For how 
many time-dimmed centuries? 

She had to rest, she was not 
used to this kind of physical ef- 
fort. She was roped between the 
two men and when she stopped 
they all stopped. Hautamaki 
halted and looked when he felt 
her hesitant tug on the rope, 
staring down at her and saying 
nothing. His body said it for 
him, arrogant, tall, heavily mus- 
cled, bronzed and nude under 
the transparent atmosphere suit. 
He was breathing lightly and 
normally, and his face never 
changed expression as he looked 
at her desperately heaving 
breast. Hautamaki! What kind 
of a man are you, Hautamaki, 
to ignore a woman with such a 
deadly glance? 

Tj'or Hautamaki it had been 
-*■ the hardest thing he had ever 
done. When the two strangers 



had walked up the extended 
tongue of the ship’s boarding 
ramp he had felt violated. 

This was his ship, his and 
Kiiskinen’s. But Kiiskinen was 
dead and the child that they had 
wanted to have was dead. Dead 
before birth, before conception. 
Dead because Kiiskinen was 
gone and Hautamaki would 
never want a child again. Yet 
there was still the job to be done; 
they had completed barely half 
of their survey swing when the 
accident had occurred. To re- 
turn to survey base would have 
been prodigiously wasteful of 
fuel and time, so he had called 
for instructions — and this had 
been the result. A new survey 
team, unfledged and raw. 

They had been awaiting first 
assignment — which meant they 
at least had the training if not 
the experience. Physically they 
would do the work that needed 
to be done. There would be no 
worry about that. But they were 
a team, and he was only half a 
team ; and loneliness can be a 
terrible thing. 

He would have welcomed them 
if Kiiskinen had been there. 
Now he loathed them. 

The man came first, extending 
his hand. “I’m Gulyas, as you 
know, and my wife Tjond.” He 
nodded over his shoulder and 
smiled, the hand still out. 

“Welcome aboard my ship,” 



132 



GALAXY 



Hautamaki said and clasped his 
own hands behind his back. If 
this fool didn’t know about the 
social customs of Men, he was 
not going to teach him. 

“Sorry. I forgot you don’t 
shake hands or touch strangers.” 
Still smiling, Gulyas moved 
aside to make room for his wife 
to enter the ship. 

“How do you do, shipmas- 
ter?” Tjond said. Then her eyes 
widened and she flushed, as she 
saw for the first time that he 
was completely nude. 

“I’ll show you your quarters,” 
Hautamaki said, turning and 
walking away, knowing they 
would follow. A woman! He had 
seen them before on various 
planets, even talked with them, 
but never had he believed that 
there would some day be one on 
his ship. How ugly they were, 
with their swollen bodies! It was 
no wonder that on the other 
worlds everyone wore clothes. 
They needed to conceal the blub- 
bery excess fat. 

“Why — he wasn’t even wear- 
ing shoes!" Tjond said indig- 
nantly as she closed the door. 
Gulyas laughed. 

“Since when has nudity both- 
ered you? You didn’t seem to 
mind it during our holiday on 
Hie. And you knew about the 
Men’s customs.” 

“That was different. Everyone 
was dressed — or undressed — 



the same. But this, it’s almost 
indecent!” 

“One man’s indecency is anoth- 
er’s decency.” 

“I bet you can’t say that three 
times fast.” 

“Nevertheless it’s true. When 
you come down to it he prob- 
ably thinks that we’re just as so- 
cially wrong as you seem to 
think he is.” 

“I don’t think — I know!" she 
said, reaching up on tiptoes to 
nip his ear with her tiny teeth, 
as white and perfectly shaped 
as rice grains. “How long have 
we been married?” 

“Six days, nineteen hours stan- 
dard, and some odd minutes.” 

“Only odd because you 
haven’t kissed me in such a ter- 
ribly long time.” 

He smiled down at her tiny, 
lovely figure, ran his hand over 
the warm firmness of her hair- 
less skull and down her spare, 
straight body. 

“You’re beautiful,” he said, 
then kissed her. 

II 

/^vnce they were across the 
glacier the going was easier 
on the hard-packed snow. With- 
in an hour they had reached the 
base of the rocky spire. It 
stretched above them against the 
green-tinted sky, black and fis- 
sured. Tjond let her eyes travel 



134 



GALAXY 



up its length and wanted to cry. 

“It’s too tall! Impossible to 
climb. With the gravsled we 
could ride up.” 

“We have discussed this be- 
fore,” Hautamaki said, looking at 
Gulyas as he always did when 
he talked to her. “I will bring 
no radiation sources near the 
device up there until we deter- 
mine what it is. Nothing can be 
learned from our aerial photo- 
graph except that it appears to 
be an untended machine of some 
kind. I will climb first. You may 
follow. It is not difficult on this 
type of rock.” 

It was not difficult — it was 
downright impossible. She 
scrambled and fell and couldn’t 
get a body’s-length up the spire. 
In the end she untied her rope. 
As soon as the two men had 
climbed above her she sobbed 
hopelessly into her hands. Gulyas 
must have heard her, or he knew 
how she felt being left out, be- 
cause he called back down to 
her. 

“I’ll drop you a rope as soon 
as we get to the top, with a loop 
on the end. Slip your arms 
through it and I’ll pull you up.” 

She was sure that he wouldn’t 
be able to do it, but still she 
had to try. The beacon — it 
might not be human made! 

The rope cut into her body, 
and surprisingly enough he 
could pull her up. She did her 



best to keep from banging into 
the cliff and twisting about: 
then Gulyas was reaching down 
to help her. Hautamaki was 
holding the rope . and she 
knew that it was the strength of 
those corded arms, not her hus- 
band’s that had brought her so 
quickly up. 

“Hautamaki, thank you for — ” 

“We will examine the device 
now,” he said, interrupting her 
and looking at Gulyas while he 
spoke. “You will both stay here 
with my pack. Do not approach 
unless you are ordered to.” 

He turned on his heel, and 
with purposeful stride went to 
the outcropping where the ma- 
chine stood. No more than a 
pace away from it he dropped to 
one knee, his body hiding most 
of it from sight, staying during 
long minutes in this cramped 
position. 

“What is he doing?” Tjond 
whispered, hugging tight to 
Gulyas’ arm. “What is it? What 
does he see?” 

“Come over here!” Hautamaki 
said, standing. There was a ring 
of emotion in his voice that they 
had never heard before. They 
ran, skidding on the ice-glazed 
rock, stopping only at the bar- 
rier of his outstretched arm. 

“What do you make of it?” 
Hautamaki asked, never taking 
his eyes from the squat machine 
fixed to the rock before them. 



FINAL ENCOUNTER 



135 



'T'here was a central structure, 

a half sphere of yellowish 
metal that clamped tight to the 
rock, its bottom edge conform- 
ing to the irregularities beneath 
it. From this projected stubby 
arms of the same material, ar- 
ranged around the circumfer- 
ence close to the base. On each 
arm was a shorter length of 
metal. Each one was shaped dif- 
ferently, but all were pointing 
skywards like questing fingers. 
An arm-thick cable emerged 
from the side of the hemisphere 
and crawled over to a higher 
shelf of rock. There it suddenly 
straightened and stood straight 
up, rearing into the air above 
their heads. Gulyas pointed to 
this. 

“I have no idea what the other 
parts do, but I’ll wager that is 
the antenna that has been send- 
ing out the signals we picked up 
when we entered this system.” 

‘‘It might be,” Hautamaki ad- 
mitted. “But what about the 
rest?” 

“One of those things that’s 
pointing up towards the sky 
looks like a little telescope,” 
Tjond said. “I really believe it 
is.” 

Hautamaki gave an angry cry 
and reached for her as she knelt 
on the ground, but he was too 
late. She pressed one eye to the 
bottom of the tube, squinted the 
other shut and tried to see. 



“Why — yes, it is a telescope!” 
She opened the other eye and 
examined the sky. “I can see the 
edge of the clouds up there very 
clearly.” 

Gulyas pulled her away, but 
there was no danger. It was a 
telescope, as she had said, noth- 
ing more. They took turns look- 
ing through it. It was Hautamaki 
who noticed that it was slowly 
moving. 

“In that case — all of the oth- 
ers must be turning too, since 
they are parallel,” Gulyas said, 
pointing to the metal devices 
that tipped each arm. One of 
them had an eyepiece not unlike 
the telescope’s, but when he 
looked into it there was only 
darkness. “I can’t see a thing 
through it,” he said. 

“Perhaps you weren’t intend- 
ed to,” Hautamaki said, rubbing 
his jaw while he stared at the 
strange machine, then turned 
away to rummage in his pack. 
He took a multi-radiation tester 
from its padded carrying case 
and held it before the eyepiece 
that Gulyas had been trying to 
look through. “Infra-red radia- 
tion only. Everything else is 
screened out.” 

Another of the tube-like things 
appeared to focus ultra-violet 
rays, while an open latticework 
of metal plates concentrated ra- 
dio waves. It was Tjond who 
voiced the thought they all had. 



136 



GALAXY 



“If I looked through a tele- 
scope — perhaps all these other 
things are telescopes too! Only 
made for alien eyes, as if the 
creatures who built the thing 
didn’t know who, or what, would 
be coming here and provided 
all kinds of telescopes working 
on all kinds of wavelengths. The 
search is over! We . mankind 
. we’re not alone in the uni- 
verse after all!” 

VX7’e mustn’t leap to conclu- 
’ ~ sions,” Hautamaki said, 
but the tone of his voice belied 
his words. 

“Why not?” Gulyas shouted, 
hugging his wife to him in a 
spasm of emotion. “Why 
shouldn’t we be the ones to find 
the aliens? If they exist at all 
we knew we would come across 
them some time! The galaxy is 
immense — but finite. Look and 
you shall find. Isn’t that what 
it says over the entrance to the 
academy?” 

“We have no real evidence 
yet,” Hautamaki said, trying not 
to let his own growing enthusi- 
asm show. He was the leader, he 
must be the devil’s advocate. 
“This device could have been 
human made.” 

“Point one,” Gulyas said, tick- 
ing off on his finger. “It resem- 
bles nothing that any of us have 
ever seen before. Secondly, it is 
made of a tough unknown alloy. 



And thirdly it is in a section of 
space that, as far as we know, 
has never been visited before. 
We are light-centuries from the 
nearest inhabited system, and 
ships that can make this sort of 
trip and return are only a rela- 
tively recent development ...” 

“And here is real evidence — 
without any guesswork!” Tjond 
shouted, and they ran over to 
her. 

She had followed the heavy 
cable that transformed itself into 
the aerial. At the base, where it 
was thickened and fastened to 
the rock, were a series of incised 
characters. There must have 
been hundreds of them, rising 
from ground level to above their 
heads, each one clear and dis- 
tinct. 

“Those aren’t human,” Tjond 
said triumphantly. “They do not 
bear the slightest resemblance 
to any written characters of any 
language known to man. They 
are newP' 

“How can you be sure?” Hau- 
tamaki said, forgetting himself 
enough to address her directly. 

“I know, shipmaster, because 
this is my specialty. I trained 
in comparative philology and 
specialized in abbicciology — 
the study of the history of alpha- 
bets. We are probably the only 
science that is in touch with 
earth — ” 

“Impossible!” 



FINAL ENCOUNTER 



137 



“No, just very slow. Earth 
must be halfway around the 
galaxy from where we are now. 
If I remember correctly, it takes 
about four hundred years for a 
round-trip communication. Ab- 
bicciology is a study that can 
only grow at the outer fringes; 
we deal with a hard core of un- 
alterable fact. The old Earth 
alphabets are part of history and 
cannot be changed. I have stud- 
ied them all, every character 
and every detail, and I have ob- 
served their mutations through 
the millennia. It can be observed 
that no matter how alphabets 
are modified and changed they 
will retain elements of their 
progenitors. That is the letter 
‘L’ as it has been adapted for 
computer input.” She scratched 
it into the rock with the tip of 
her knife, then incised a wavy 
character next to it. “And this 
is the Hebrew lamedh, in which 
you can see the same basic shape. 
Hebrew is a proto-alphabet, so 
ancient as to be almost unbeliev- 
able. Yet there is the same right- 
angle bend. But these characters 
— there is nothing there that I 
have ever seen before.” 

r T~'he silence stretched on while 
*■ Hautamaki looked at her, 
studied her as if the truth or 
falsity of her words might be 
written somehow on her face. 
Then he smiled. 



“I’ll take your word for it. 
I’m sure you know your field 
very well.” He walked back to 
his pack and began taking out 
more test instruments. 

“Did you see that,” Tjond 
whispered in her husband’s ear, 
“he smiled at me.” 

“Nonsense. It is probably the 
first rictus of advanced frost- 
bite.” 

Hautamaki had hung a weight 
from the barrel of the telescope 
and was timing its motion over 
the ground. “Gulyas,” he asked, 
“do you remember this planet’s 
period of rotation?” 

“Roughly eighteen standard 
hours. The computation wasn’t 
exact. Why?” 

“That’s close enough. We are 
at about 85 degrees north lati- 
tude here, which conforms to the 
angle of those rigid arms, while 
the motion of these scopes ...” 
“Counteracts the planet’s rota- 
tion, moving at the same speed 
in the opposite direction. Of 
course! I should have seen it.” 
“What are you two talking 
about?” Tjond asked. 

“They point to the same spot 
in the sky all the time,” Gulyas 
said. “To a star.” 

“It could be another planet in 
this system,” Hautamaki said, 
then shook his head. “No, there 
is no reason for that. It is some- 
thing outside. We will tell after 
dark.”

They were comfortable in 
their atmosphere suits and had 
enough food and water. The ma- 
chine was photographed and 
studied from every angle and 
they theorized on its possible 
power source. In spite of this the 
hours dragged by until dusk. 
There were some clouds, but 
they cleared away before sunset. 
When the first star appeared in 
the darkening sky Hautamaki 
bent to the ocular of the tele- 
scope. 

“Just sky. Too light yet. But 
there is some sort of glowing 
grid appearing in the field, five 
thin lines radiating in from the 
circumference. Instead of cross- 
ing they fade as they come to 
the center.” 

“But they’ll point out what- 
ever star is in the center of the 
field — without obscuring it?” 

“Yes. The stars are appearing 
now.” 

It was a seventh-magnitude 
star, isolated near the galactic 
rim. It appeared commonplace 
in every way except for its loca- 
tion, with no nearby neighbors 
even in stellar terms. They took 
turns looking at it, marking it 
so they could not possibly mis- 
take it for any other. 

“Are we going here?” Tjond 
asked, though it was more of a 
statement than a question that 
sought an answer. 

“Of course,” Hautamaki said. 



s soon as their ship had 
-^■cleared atmosphere, Hauta- 
maki sent a message to the near- 
est relay station. While they 
waited for an answer they ana- 
lyzed the material they had. 

With each result their enthu- 
siasm grew. The metal was no 
harder than some of the resist- 
ant alloys they used, but its com- 
position was completely differ- 
ent and some unknown process 
of fabrication had been used 
that had compacted the surface 
molecules to a greater density. 
The characters bore no resem- 
blance to any human alphabet. 
And the star towards which the 
instruments had been pointed 
was far beyond the limits of gal- 
actic exploration. 

When the message arrived, 
signal recorded, they jumped 
the ship at once on the carefully 
computed and waiting course. 
Their standing instructions were 
to investigate anything, report 
everything, and this they were 
doing. With their planned 
movements recorded they were 
free. They, they, were going to 
make a first contact with an 
alien race — had already made 
contact with one of its artifacts. 
No matter what happened now, 
the honor was irrevocably theirs. 
The next meal turned naturally 
into a celebration, and Hauta-

maki unbent enough to allow 
other intoxicants as well as 
wine. The results were almost 
disastrous. 

“A toast!” Tjond shouted, 
standing and wobbling just a bit. 

“To Earth and mankind — no 
longer alone!” 

No longer alone, they repeat- 
ed, and Hautamaki’s face lost 
some of the party gaiety that it 
had reluctantly gained. 

“I ask you to join me in a 
toast,” he said, “to someone you 
never knew, who should have 
been here to share this with us.” 

“To Kiiskinen,” Gulyas said. 
He had read the records and 
knew about the tragedy that was 
still fresh in Hautamaki’s 
thoughts. 

“Thank you. To Kiiskinen.” 
They drank. 

“I wish we could have met 
him,” Tjond said, a tendril of 
feminine curiosity tickling at 
her. 

“A fine, man,” Hautamaki 
said, seeming anxious to talk 
now that the subject had been 
broached for the first time since 
the accident. “One of the very 
finest. We were twelve years on 
this ship.” 

“Did you have children?” 

Tjond asked. 

“Your curiosity is not fitting,” 
Gulyas snapped at his wife. “I 
think it would be better if we 
dropped. 



T T autamaki held up his hand. 

“Please. I understand your 
natural interest. We Men have 
settled only a dozen or so plan- 
ets and I imagine our customs 
are curious to you; we are only 
in a minority as yet. But if there 
is any embarrassment it is all 
your own. Are you embarrassed 
about being bisexual? Would 
you kiss your wife in public?” 

“A pleasure,” Gulyas said, and 
did. 

“Then you understand what I 
mean. We feel the same way and 
at times act the same way, though 
our society is monosexual. It 
was a natural result of ecto- 
genesis.” 

“Not natural,” Tjond said, a 
touch of color in her cheeks. 
“Ectogenesis needs a fertile 
ovum. Ova come from females; 
an ectogenetic society should 
logically be a female society. An 
all-male one is unnatural.” 

“Everything we do is unna- 
tural,” Hautamaki told her with- 
out apparent anger. “Man is an 
environment-changing animal. 
Every person living away from 
Earth is living in an ‘unnatural’ 
environment. Ectogenesis on 
these terms in no more unna- 
tural than living, as we are now, 
in a metal hull in an unreal 
manifestation of space-time. 
That this ectogenesis should 
combine the germ plasm from 
two male cells rather than from 



140 



GALAXY 



an egg and a sperm is of no 
more relevancy than your vesti- 
gial breasts.” 

“You are being insulting,” she 
said, blushing. 

“Not in the least. They have 
lost their function, therefore 
they are degenerative. You bi- 
sexuals are just as natural — or 
unnatural — as we Men. Nei- 
ther is viable without the ‘un- 
natural’ environment that we 
have created.” 

The excitement of their recent 
discovery still possessed them, 
and perhaps the stimulants and 
the anger had lowered Tjond’s 
control. “Why — how dare you 
call me unnatural — you — ” 

“You forget yourself, woman!” 
Hautamaki boomed, drowning 
out the word, leaping to his feet. 
“You expected to pry into the 
intimate details of my life and 
are insulted when I mention 
some of your own taboos. The 
Men are better off without your 
kind!” He drew a deep, shudder- 
ing breath, turned on his heel 
and left the room. 

Tjond stayed in their quarters 
for almost a standard week af- 
ter that evening. She worked on 
her analysis of the alien charac- 
ters and Gulyas brought her 
meals. Hautamaki did not men- 
tion the events, and cut Gulyas 
off when he tried to apologize 
for his wife. But he made no 
protest when she appeared again 



in the control section, though 
he reverted to his earlier custom 
of speaking only to Gulyas, nev- 
er addressing her directly. 

T''yd he actually want me to 
come too?” Tjond asked, 
closing her tweezers on a single 
tiny hair that marred the ivory 
sweep of her smooth forehead 
and skull. She pulled it out and 
touched her brow. “Have you 
noticed that he really has eye- 
brows? Right here, great shabby 
things like an atavism. Even 
hair around the base of his skull. 
Disgusting. Ill bet you that the 
Men sort their genes for hirsute- 
ness, it couldn’t be accident. 
You never answered — did he 
ask for me to be there?” 

“You never gave me a chance 
to answer,” Gulyas told her, a 
smile softening his words. “He 
didn’t ask for you by name. That 
would be expecting too much. 
But he did say that there would 
be a full crew meeting at nine- 
teen hours.” 

She put a touch of pink make- 
up on the lobes of her ears and 
the bottoms of her nostrils, then 
snapped her cosmetic case shut. 
“I’m ready whenever you are. 
Shall we go see what the ship- 
master wants?” 

“In twenty hours we’ll be 
breaking out of jump-space,” 
Hautamaki told them when they 
had met in the control section. 



FINAL ENCOUNTER 



141 



“There is a very good chance 
that we will encounter the peo- 
ple — the aliens — who con- 
structed the beacon. Until we 
discover differently we will as- 
sume that they are peacefully 
inclined. Yes, Gulyas?” 

“Shipmaster, there has been a 
good deal of controversy on the 
intentions of any hypothetical 
race that might be encountered. 
There has been no real agree- 
ment. .” 

“It does not matter. I am ship- 
master. The evidence so far in- 
dicates a race looking for con- 
tact. not conquest. I see it this 
way. We have a rich and very 
old culture, so while we have 
been searching for another in- 
telligent life form we have also 
been exploring and recording 
with ships like this one. A poor- 
er culture might be limited in 
the number of ships that they 
could apply to this kind of oc- 
cupation. Therefore the beacons. 
Many of them could be easily 
planted by a single ship over a 
large area of space. There are 
undoubtedly others. All of them 
serve to draw attention to a 
single star, a rendezvous point 
of. some type.” 

■nphis doesn’t prove peaceful 
intentions. It could be a 
trap.” 

“I doubt it. There are far 
better ways to satisfy warlike 

142 



tendencies than to set elaborate 
traps like this. I think their in- 
tentions are peaceful, and that 
is the only factor that matters. 
Until we actually encounter 
them any action will have to be 
based on a guess. Therefore I 
have already jettisoned the 
ship’s armament — ” 

“You what?" 

“ — and I’ll ask you to surren- 
der any personal weapons that 
you might have in your posses- 
sion.” 

“You’re risking our lives — 
without even consulting us,” 
Tjond said angrily. 

“Not at all,” he answered, not 
looking ,at her. “You risked 
your own life when you entered 
the service and took the oath. 
You will obey my instructions. 
All weapons here within the 
hour; I want the ship clean be- 
fore we break through. We will 
meet the strangers armed only 
with our humanity. You may 
think the Men go naked for 
some perverse reason, but that 
is wrong. We have discarded 
clothes as detrimental to total 
involvement in our environ- 
ment, a both practical and sym- 
bolic action.” 

“You aren’t suggesting that 
we remove our clothes as well, 
are you?” Tjond asked, still 
angry. 

“Not at all. Do as you please. 
I am just attempting to explain 



GALAXY 



my reasons so we will have some 
unanimity of action when we 
encounter the intelligent crea- 
tures who built the beacon. Sur- 
vey knows now where we are. 
If we do not return, a later con- 
tact team will be protected by 
mankind’s complete armory of 
death. So we will now give our 
aliens every opportunity to kill 
us — if that is what they are 
planning. Retribution will fol- 
low. If they do not have warlike 
intentions we will make peace- 
ful contact. That, in itself, is 
reason enough to risk one’s life 
a hundred times over. I don’t 
have to explain to you the mon- 
umental importance of such a 
contact.” 

The tension grew as the time 
for break-through approached. 
The box of handguns, explosive 
charges, poisons from the lab- 
oratory — even the large knives 
from the kitchen — had long 
since been jettisoned. They were 
all in the control area when the 
bell pinged softly and they broke 
through, back into normal 
space. Here, at the galactic rim, 
most of the stars were massed to 
one side. Ahead lay a pit of 
blackness with a single star 
glowing. 

“That’s it,” Gulyas said, swing- 
ing back the spectral analyzer, 
“but we’re not close enough for 
clear observation. Are we going 
to take another jump now?” 



“No,” Hautamaki said, “I want 
a clevs observation first.” 

r T~'he sensitive clevs screen be- 

gan to glow as soon as the pres- 
sure dropped, darkening slowly. 
There were occasional bursts of 
light from their surface as ran- 
dom molecules of air struck 
them, then this died away. The 
forward screen deepened to the 
blackness of outer space and in 
its center appeared the image of 
the star. 

“It’s impossible!” Tjond gasp- 
ed from the observer’s seat be- 
hind them. 

“Not impossible,” Hautamaki 
said. “Just impossible of natural 
origin. Its existence proves that 
what we see can — and has — 
been constructed. We will pro- 
ceed.” 

The star image burned with 
unreality. The star itself at the 
core was normal enough — but 
how to explain the three inter- 
locking rings that circled it? 
They had the dimensions of a 
planetary orbit. Even if they 
were as tenuous as a comet’s tail 
their construction was an in- 
credible achievement. And what 
could be the significance of the 
colored lights on the rings, ap- 
parantly orbiting the primary 
like insane electrons? 

The screen sparkled and the 
image faded. 

“It could only be a beacon,” 



FINAL ENCOUNTER 



143 



Hautamaki said, removing his 
helmet. “It is there to draw at- 
tention, as was the radio beacon 
that drew us to the last planet. 
What race with the curiosity to 
build spaceships could possibly 
resist the attraction of a thing 
like that?” 

Gulyas was feeding the course 
corrections into the computor. 
“It is still baffling,” he said. 
“With the physical ability to 
construct that why haven’t they 
built an exploring fleet to go 
out and make contacts — instead 
of trying to draw them in?” 

“I hope that we will discover 
that answer soon. Though it 
. probably lies in whatever com- 
poses their alien psychology. To 
their way of thinking this might 
be the obvious manner. And you 
will have to admit that it has 
worked.” 

IV 

'TPhis time when they made the 
transition from jumpspace 
the glowing rings of light filled 
the front ports. Their radio re- 
ceivers were on, automatically 
searching the wavelengths. 

They burst into sound on a 
number of bands simultaneously. 
Gulyas lowered the volume. 

“This is the same kind of 
broadcast we had from the bea- 
con,” he said. “Very directional. 
All of the transmissions are 



coming from that golden plane- 
toid, or whatever it is. It’s big, 
but doesn’t seem to have a plane- 
tary diameter.” 

“We’re on our way,” Hauta- 
maki told him. “I’ll take the 
controls, see if you can get any 
image on the video circuits.” 

“Just interference. But I’m 
sending out a signal, a view of 
this cabin. If they have the right 
equipment there they should be 
able to analyze our signal and 
match it. Look, the screen is 
changing! They’re working 
fast.” 

The viewscreen was rippling 
with color. Then a picture ap- 
peared, blurred, then steadied. 
Tjond focused and it snapped in- 
to clear life The two men look- 
ed, stared. Behind them Tjond 
gasped. 

“At least no snakes or insects, 
praise fortune for that!” 

The being on the screen was 
staring at them with the same in- 
tensity. There was no way to 
estimate its relative size, but it 
was surely humanoid. Three 
long fingers, heavily webbed, 
with an opposed thumb. Only 
the upper part of its figure was 
visible, and this was clothed so 
that no physical details could be 
seen. But the being’s face stood 
out clearly on the screen, golden 
in color, hairless, with large, al- 
most circular eyes. Its nose, had 
it been a human one, would be 



144 



GALAXY 



said to be broken, spread over 
its face, nostrils flaring. This, 
and the cleft upper lip, gave it a 
grim appearance to human eyes. 

But this yardstick could not 
be applied. By alien standards 
it might be beautiful. 

“S’bb’thik,” the creature said. 
The radio beacons carried the 
matching audio now. The voice 
was high pitched and squeaky. 

“I greet you as well,” Hauta- 
maki said. “We both have spok- 
en languages and we will learn 
to understand each other. But 
we come in peace.” 

“Maybe we do, but I can’t say 
the same thing for these aliens,” 
Gulyas interrupted. “Look at 
screen three.” 

This held an enlarged view 
taken from one of the forward 
pickups, locked onto the plane- 
toid they were approaching. A 
group of dark buildings stood 
out from the golden surface, 
crowned with a forest of aerials 
and antennas. Ringed about the 
building were circular structures 
mounted with squat tubular de- 
vices that resembled heavy-bore 
weapons. The similarity was in- 
creased by the fact that the nu- 
merous emplacements had ro- 
tated. The open orifices were 
tracking the approaching ship. 

“I’m killing our approach ve- 
locity,” Hautamaki said, stab- 
bing the control buttons in rapid 
sequence. “Set up a repeater 



plate here and switch on a mag- 
nified view of those weapons. 
We’ll find out their intentions 
right now.” 

/^vnce their motion relative to 
the golden planetoid had 
been stopped, Hautamaki turned 
and pointed to the repeater 
screen, slowly tapping the image 
of the weapons. Then he tapped 
himself on the chest and raised 
his hands before him, fingers 
spread wide, empty. The alien 
had watched this dumb show 
with glistening, golden eyes. It 
rocked its head from side to side 
and repeated Hautamaki’s ges- 
ture, tapping itself on the chest 
with its long central finger, then 
pointed into the screen. 

“He understood at once,” 
Gulyas said. “Those weapons — 
they’re turning away, sinking 
out of sight.” 

“We’ll continue our approach. 
Are you recording this?” 

“Sight, sound, full readings 
from every instrument. We’ve 
been recording since we first 
saw the star, with the tapes be- 
ing fed into the armored vault 
as you ordered. I wonder what 
the next step is?” 

“They’ve already taken it — 
look.” 

The image of the alien reach- 
ed off the screen and brought 
back what appeared to be a 
metal sphere that it held lightly 



FINAL ENCOUNTER 



145 



in one hand. From the sphere 
projected a pipe-like extrusion 
of metal with a lever half way 
up its length. When the alien 
pressed the lever they heard a 
hissing. 

“A tank of gas,” Gulyas said. 
‘‘I wonder what it is supposed 
to signify? No — it’s not gas. It 
must be a vacuum. See, the pipe 
is sucking up those grains sprin- 
kled on the table.” The alien 
kept the lever depressed until 
the hissing stopped. 

“Ingenious,” Hautamaki said. 
“Now we know there is a sample 
of their atmosphere inside that 
tank.” 

There was no mechanical pro- 
pulsion visible, but the sphere 
came swooping up towards their 
ship where it swung in orbit 
above the golden planetoid. The 
sphere stopped, just outside the 
ship and clearly visible from 
the viewports, bobbing in a 
small arc. 

“Some sort of force beam,” 
Hautamaki said, “though noth- 
ing registers on the hull instru- 
ments. That’s one thing I hope 
we find out how to do. I’m go- 
ing to open the outer door on 
the main hatch.” 

'As soon as the door opened 
the sphere swooped and vanish- 
ed from sight and they saw, 
through the pickup inside the 
air lock, that it fell gently to 
the deck inside. Hautamaki 



closed the door and pointed to 
Gulyas. 

“Take a pair of insulated 
gloves and carry that tank to the 
lab. Run the contents through 
the usual air examination pro- 
cedures that we use for testing 
planetary atmosphere. As soon 
as you have taken the sample 
evacuate the tank and fill it 
with our own air, then throw it 
out through the lock.” 

r T"'he analyzers worked on the 
sample of alien air, and pre- 
sumably the aliens were doing 
the same with their tank of 
ship’s atmosphere. The analysis 
was routine and fast, the report 
appearing in coded form on the 
panel in control. 

“Unbreathable,” Gulyas said, 
“at least for us. There seems to 
be enough oxygen, more than 
enough, but any of those sul- 
phurated compounds would eat 
holes through our lungs. They 
must have rugged metabolisms 
to inhale stuff like that. One 
thing for certain, we’ll never be 
in competition for the same 
worlds ” 

“Look! The picture is chang- 
ing,” Tjond said, drawing their 
attention back to the viewing 
screen. 

The alien had vanished and 
the viewpoint appeared to be in 
space above the planetoid’s sur- 
face. A transparent bulge on its 



146 



GALAXY 



surface filled the screen and 
while they watched the alien en- 
tered it from below. The scene 
shifted again, then they were 
looking at the alien from inside 
the clear-walled chamber. The 
alien came towards the pickup, 
but before reaching it the alien 
stopped and leaned against what 
appeared to be thin air. 

“There’s a transparent wall 
that divided the dome in half,” 
Gulyas said. “I’m beginning to 
get the idea.” 

The pickup panned away from 
the alien, swept around to the 
opposite direction where there 
was an entrance cut into the 
clear fabric of the wall. The 
door was open into space. 

“That’s obvious enough,” Hau- 
tamaki said, rising to his feet. 
“That central wall must be air- 
tight, so it can be used for a 
conference chamber. I’ll go. 
Keep a record of everything.” 

“It looks like a trap,” Tjond 
said, fidgeting with her fingers 
while she looked at the inviting- 
ly open door on the screen. “It 
will be a risk. 

Hautamaki laughed, the first 
time they had ever heard him 
do it, as he climbed into his 
pressure suit. “A trap! Do you 
believe they have gone to all 
this to set a trap for me? Such 
ego is preposterous. And if it 
were a trap — do you think it 
possible to stay out of it?” 



TJe pushed himself free of the 
-*• ^ ship. His suited figure float- 
ed away, getting smaller and 
smaller. 

Silently, moving closer togeth- 
er without realizing they did so, 
they watched the meeting on the 
screen. They saw Hautamaki 
drawn gently in through the 
open doorway until his feet 
touched the floor. He turned to 
look as the door closed, while 
from the radio they heard a hiss- 
ing, very dimly at first, then 
louder and louder. 

“It sounds like they are pres- 
surizing the room,” Gulyas said. 

Hautamaki nodded. “Yes, I 
can hear it now, and there is a 
reading on the external pressure 
gauge. As soon as it reaches at- 
mospheric normal I’m taking 
my helmet off.” 

Tjond started to protest, but 
stopped when her husband 
raised his hand in warning. This 
was Hautamaki’s decision to 
make. 

“Smells perfectly breathable,” 
Hautamaki said, “though it has 
a metallic odor.” 

He laid his helmet aside and 
stripped his suit off. The alien 
was standing at the partition 
and Hautamaki walked over un- 
til they stood face to face, al- 
most the same height. The alien 
placed his palm flat against the 
transparent wall and the human 
put his hand over the same spot. 



FINAL ENCOUNTER 



147 



They met, as close as they could, 
separated only by a centimeter 
of substance. Their eyes joined 
and they stared for a long time, 
trying to read intent, trying to 
communicate. The alien turned 
away first, walking over to a 
table littered with a variety of 
objects. It picked up the nearest 
one and held it for Hautamaki 
to see. “Kilt,” the alien said. It 
looked like a piece of stone. 

Hautamaki for the first time 
took notice of the table on his 
side of the partition. It appeared 
to hold the identical objects as 
the other table, and the first of 
these was a lump of ordinary 
stone. He picked it up. 

“Stone,” he said, then turned 
to the television pickup and the 
unseen viewers in the ship. “It 
appears that a language lesson 
is first. This is obvious. See that 
this is recorded separately. Then 
we can program the computor 
for machine translation in case 
the aliens aren’t doing it them- 
selves.” 

The language lesson progress- 
ed slowly once the stock of sim- 
ple nouns with physical refer- 
ents had been exhausted. Films 
were shown, obviously prepared 
long before, showing simple ac- 
tions, and bit by bit verbs and 
tense were exchanged. The alien 
made no attempt to learn their 
language, he just worked to in- 
sure accuracy of identity in the 



words. They were recording too. 
As the language lesson progress- 
ed Gulyas’s frown deepened, and 
he started to make notes, then 
a list that he checked off. Fin- 
ally he interrupted the lesson. 

“Hautamaki — this is impor- 
tant. Find out if they are just 
accumulating a vocabulary or if 
they are feeding a MT with this 
material.” 

The answer came from the 
alien itself. It turned its head 
sideways, as if listening to a dis- 
tant voice, then spoke into a 
cup-like device at the end of a 
wire. A moment later Hauta- 
maki’s voice spoke out, toneless 
since each word had been record- 
ed separately. 

“I talk through a machine . 

I talk my talk ... a machine talk 

your talk to you I am Liem 

. we need have more words in 
machine before talk well.” 

“This can’t wait,” Gulyas said. 
“Tell them that we want a 
sample of some of their body 
cells, any cells at all. It is com- 
plex, but try to get it across.” 

The aliens were agreeable. 
They did not insist on a speci- 
men in return, but accepted one. 
A sealed container brought a 
frozen sliver of what looked like 
muscle tissue over to the ship. 
Gulyas started towards the lab. 

“Take care of the recordings,” 
he told his wife. “I don’t think 
this will take too long.”

V 

I t didn’t. Within the hour he 
had returned, coming up so 
silently that Tjond, intent on 
listening to the language lesson, 
did not notice him until he 
stood next to her. 

“Your face,” she said. “What 
is wrong? What did you dis- 
cover?” 

He smiled wryly at her. “Noth- 
ing terrible, I assure you. But 
things are very different from 
what we supposed.” 

“What is it?” Hautamaki ask- 
ed from the screen. He had 
heard their voices and turned to- 
wards the pickup. 

“How has the language pro- 
gressed?” Guylas asked. “Can 
you understand me, Liem?” 
“Yes,” the alien said, “almost 
all of the words are clear now. 
But the machine has only a 
working force of a few thousand 
words so you must keep your 
speech simple.” 

“I understand. The things I 
want to say are very simple. 
First a question. Your people, 
do they come from a planet or- 
biting about a star near here?” 
“No. We have traveled a long 
way to this star, searching. My 
home world is there, among 
those stars there.” 

“Do all your people live on 
that world?” 

“No, we live on many worlds, 



but we are all children of chil- 
dren of children of people who 
lived on one world very long 
ago. 

“Our people have also settled 
many worlds, but we all come 
from one world,” Gulyas told 
him, then looked down at the 
paper in his hands. He smiled 
at the alien in the screen before 
him, but there was something 
terribly sad about this smile. 
“We came originally from a 
planet named Earth. That is 
where your people came from 
too. We are brothers, Liem.” 

“What madness is this?” Hau- 
tamaki shouted at him, his face 
swollen and angry. “Liem is hu- 
manoid, not human! It cannot 
breathe our air!” 

"He cannot breathe our air, 
or perhaps she,” Gulyas answer- 
ed quietly. “We do not use gene 
manipulation, but we know that 
it is possible. I’m sure we will 
eventually discover just how 
Liem’s people were altered to 
live under the physical condi- 
tions they do now. It might have 
been natural selection and nor- 
mal mutation, but it seems too 
drastic a change to be explained 
that way. But that is not impor- 
tant. This is.” He held up the 
sheets of notes and photographs. 
“You can see for yourself. This 
is the DNR chain from the nu- 
cleus of one of my own cells. 
This is Liem’s. They are.identi-

149 



cal. His people are as human 
as we are.” 

“They can’t be!” Tjond shook 
her head in bewilderment. “Just 
look at him, he is so different, 
and their alphabet — what about 
that? I cannot be wrong about 
that.” 

“There is one possibility you 
did not allow for, a totally in- 
dependent alphabet. You your- 
self told me that there is not 
the slightest similarity between 
the Chinese ideographs and 
western letters. If Liem’s people 
suffered a cultural disaster that 
forced them to completely re- 
invent writing you would have 
your alien alphabet. As to the 
way they look — just consider 
the thousands of centuries that 
have passed since mankind left 
Earth and you will see that his 
physical differences are minor. 
Some are natural and some may 
have been artificially achieved, 
but geim plasm cannot lie. We 
are all the sons of man.” 

CtTt is possible,” Liem said, 

A speaking for the first time. 
“I am informed that our biolo- 
gists agree with you. Our points 
of difference are minor when 
compared to the points of simi- 
larity. Where is this Earth you 
come from?” 

Hautamaki pointed at the sky 
above them, at the star-filled 
sweep of the Milky Way, burn- 



ing with massed stars. “There, 
far out there on the other side 
of the core, roughly half way 
around the lens of the galaxy.” 

“The core explains partially 
what must have happened,” 
Gulyas said. “It is thousands of 
light-years in diameter and over 
10,000 degrees in temperature. 
We have explored its fringes. No 
ship could penetrate it or even 
approach too closely because of 
the dust clouds that surround it. 
So we have expanded outwards, 
slowly circling the rim of the 
galaxy, moving away from 
Earth. If we stopped to think 
about it we should have realized 
that mankind was moving the 
other way too, in the opposite 
direction around the wheel.” 

“And sometime we would 
have to meet,” Liem said. “Now 
I greet you, brothers. And I am 
sad, because I know what this 
means.” 

“We are alone,” Hautamaki 
said, looking at the massed tril- 
lions of stars. “We have closed 
the circle and found only our- 
selves. The galaxy is ours, but 
we are alone.” He turned about, 
not realizing that Liem, the 
golden alien — the man — had 
turned at the same time in the 
same manner. 

They faced outwards, looking 
at the infinite depth and infinite 
blackness of intergalactic space, 
empty of stars. Dimly, distantly, 



150 



GALAXY 



there were spots of light, micro- 
scopic blurs against the dark- 
ness, not stars but island uni- 
verses, like the one at whose 
perimeter they stood. 

These two beings were differ- 
ent in many ways: in the air 
they breathed, the color of their 
skins, their languages, manner- 
isms, cultures. They were as dif- 
ferent as the day is from the 
night: the flexible fabric of 

mankind had been warped by 
the countless centuries until 
they could no longer recognize 
each other. But time, distance 
and mutation could not change 
one thing: they were still men, 
still human. 



“It is certain then,” Hautn- 
maki said, “we are alone in the 
galaxy.” 

“Alone in this galaxy.” 

They looked at each other, 
then glanced away. At that mo- 
ment they measured their hu- 
manness against the same rule 
and were equal. 

For they had turned at the 
same instant and looked out- 
ward into intergalactic space, to- 
wards the infinitely remote light 
that was another island galaxy. 

“It will be difficult to get 
there,” • someone said. 

They had lost a battle. There 
was no defeat.

AT THE FEELIES 

Review, by JACK SHARKEY 



I had high hopes when I at- 
tended the re-processed Gone 
with the Wind at the Music Hall 
the other day, but came away 
considerably less than gruntled 
at the results. The addition of 
tactility, odor, taste, 3-D and 
selective-subjective (Selsub) 
camera work seems to detract 
from, rather than improve, this 
last-century classic, though I 
must admit my viewpoint was 
rather biliously biased by the 
underdone pork ribs I con- 
sumed (as the taller Tarleton 
twin) in the barbecue-eating 
scene at the Wilkes plantation. 
Scarlett’s peppery old parsnip, 
later on, didn’t help my increas- 



ing tendency toward malaise, 
either. 

The benefit ball was a joy, but 
Aunt Pittipat’s underarm prob- 
lem was laid on a bit thick, and I 
sincerely wished I (as Rhett) had 
had the chance to take Scarlett 
outside for air. Likewise, bad 
cutting in the love scenes had me 
shifting nerve-rackingly from 
being Rhett to being Scarlett. 
Selsub still has a few bugs. Up 
until the last minute I trembled 
between the option of kissing 
Vivian Leigh or being resound- 
ingly bussed by Clark Gable. 

As to the burning of Atlanta, 
the heat effects were well-nigh 
perfect, and I felt quite narrow- 



152 



ly escaped from a good scorch- 
ing. But there again, the rein- 
bums on my hand as I led the 
horse through the holocaust kept 
shifting embarrassingly to 
twinges of Melanie’s bumpy ride 
in the wagon, and mingled with 
the charred aroma of the town 
was much too much effluvium 
of her baby’s sour milk. 

A ludicrous error on the part 
of the tacility-coordinator (Tac- 
co) had me one moment feeling 
the green velvet drapes in my 
(Scarlett’s) fingers before rip- 
ping them down for Mammy to 
sew into a gown, and the next I 
was the drapes, and had sunder- 
ed vertically to the navel before 
a merciful shift of scene rest- 
fully transformed me into a rif- 
fling pack of cards in a guard’s 
hand outside Rhett’s cell. 

I think it’s going too far for 
excitement to allow the specta- 
tor to be Bonnie Blue in that 
fatal gallop toward the high 
hurdles, but the quick switch 
into the identity of her pony an 
instant after her tumble toward 
death began was not much re- 
lief, due to the subsequent scene 
where Rhett comes to my stall 
and puts a pistol-ball between 
my eyes. 

. One suggestion to the distribu- 
tors: in the final moment of the 
movie, when I (Scarlett) stand 
once again silhouetted against 
the skies on the lush fields of 



Tara, with the glorious theme 
music rising like an angelic 
choir about me, wouldn’t it be 
more in keeping with the mood 
of that moment to fill my nos- 
trils with the sweet scent of 
dewy, burgeoning grain, instead 
of wafting a staggering stench 
of hot fertilizer from the stables? 

To date, have not had the op- 
portunity of experiencing the 
remake of The Lost Weekend, 
but my fellow-reviewers’ unani- 
mous opinions in print that it 
was “shimply wunnerful, wun- 
nerful, wunnerful” make it a 
must on my schedule in the com- 
ing week. 

The staff of our paper ex- 
presses its regrets to the employ- 
ers of the late Barnaby Ring- 
wold of the Herald, whose ca- 
reer as a feelie-reviewer was cur- 
tailed so tragically last week 
during a viewing of Mr. Pea- 
body and the Mermaid, when 
that unforeseen slip of the Tacco- 
mechanism turned him (and 
other unfortunate patrons at the 
Strand) into Ann Blyth’s body 
with William Powell’s lungs. 

By all means do not delay in 
attending the Laurel and Hardy 
Festival at the Museum of Mod- 
em Art. Despite the purist-ori- 
ented objections of Elia Kazan, 
Jr. (now in charge of extra-vis-

ual additions to the beloved old 
silents), the froth on the pies 
(soapsuds when the films were 
made) has been flavored, never- 
theless, to taste like whipped 
cream, and you will find this 
movie melange of their best 
slapstick efforts one of the most 
currently delicious showings in 
town. 

The long-awaited release of 
De Sade, Man or Monster? has 
been snarled in more red tape, 
and recalled to the studio for 
Selsub-changes. The producers’ 
hones of a good cross-section of 
masochism in the public has, it 
appears, been over- optimistic. 
Nobody at the sneak nreviews 
has shown signs of wishing to 
be anybody in the film but the 
Marquis himself. This will come 
as a blow to those many ac- 
tresses whose every last ganglion 
was violated to record onto the 
lacco-track for the spectators’ 
fullest experience. 

Once again, the rankest sort 
of censorship is despoiling the 
pleasures of the feelie-going 
public. Universal’s two-hour- 
long epic, Dracula’s Grandson, 
• has been sliced^ chopped and 
otherwise ravaged of its gusta- 
torial merits (“for the sake of 
the children” says one of the 
reports), and I was somewhat 



disappointed to discover that 
the throats of the mesmerized 
maidens who fall victim to the 
nefarious Count yielded nothing 
tastier than strawberry phos- 
phate. In my opinion, this is not 
shielding the children from re- 
ality, it is tempting them to out- 
right emulation! The world had 
best prepare itself for a series 
of bizarre crimes involving 
punctured maidens and bitterly 
disillusioned, phosphate-hungry 
children, if this situation is not 
shortly remedied. 

Ben-Hur’s re-release still 
pending while the film moguls 
continue to search for someone 
willing to sell his physical re- 
actions to the Tacco-pool. It just 
wouldn’t be Ben-Hur without a 
brief Selsub of Messala’s run-in 
with the chariots. 

I drew the short straw in the 
most controversial reviewing job 
in feelie history. As representa- 
tive of not only my, but every 
other local reviewer’s, paper, I 
will be the first person — in- 
cluding those involved in the 
production — to experience the 
re-processed version of Hitch- 
cock’s Psycho. I’m assured by 
the new producers that the role 
of Marion Crane is only Taccoed 
in for objective sensations. I 
hope so. —JACK SHARKEY

and SOUPY 
WHISPERS 



BY SYDNEY VAN SCYOC 



When a machine goes haywire , 
you simply repair it. Now , 
what do you do about man? 



T Te awoke several feet outside 
his window, standing on his 
hands. Only the narrow ledge on 
which he stood separated him 
from an emptiness that ended 
seventeen stories below in pave- 
ment. But, realizing at once 
where he was, he did not panic. 
No. He simply smiled and 
brought his legs slowly, slowly 
from the wall where they leaned. 

She couldn’t frighten him that 
easily. 



“Foolish, Joel, foolish,” she 
lisped inside him. She had a 
silly, soft, soupy voice. 

He smiled and made three 
firm steps toward the window. 
His elbows did not buckle; his 
heart did not pound. 

Then as he steadied himself, 
his legs swayed out over empti- 
ness. Frantically he stiffened his 
back, fought his legs to the wall. 
His arms quivered, and his face 
dampened. 



155 



She was smug. “Silly showoff 
Joel.” 

He scowled. He would not say, 
I can’t do it, help me, save me. 
No. He drew an heroic breath 
and made another step. 

His legs swayed again. His el- 
bows quivered, buckled. Before 
he could straighten, her giggling 
filled his head. 

He fought for balance and lost. 
His legs bent back and over. He 
clawed at the ledge, then fell 
tumbling, eyes squeezed tight, 
shoulders set. 

She giggled and giggled. 

When he had fallen too long, 
he knew she had not let him fall 
but the falling went on. 

He awoke on the bed, shaking, 
damp and sick. 

T T e swung himself up. “I could 
have gotten myself in,” he 
muttered darkly. 

“You have excellent balance.” 
Her voice was silky now, mur- 
muring. 

“Then why did you make me 
fall?” he demanded. 

“Hands getting very tired. Oh, 
foolish.” 

“You made me fall because my 
hands were getting tired!” he 
howled. His fingers twitched. 
He wanted to break something. 
Her. 

“Angry?” she clucked. “Anger 
best gotten from system.” 

He couldn’t help himself. He 



plunged about the room, smash- 
ing at impressively papered walls 
with a brocaded chair, splinter- 
ing, tearing. 

“Angry, Joel?” she taunted. 

“No, damn it!” He smashed 
and smashed. 

“Angry? Angry?” 

He hurled shoes at a gold 
framed mirror. Glass tinkled and 
tinkled. 

At last he had no strength, 
and his breath burned. 

“More anger, Joel?” she taunt- 
ed. 

He panted. “You know I’m too 
beat to be angry.” He sank to 
the bed, heaving. His fingers still 
twitched. He sat on them, hard, 
and they twitched under him 
like worms. 

He had to get away from them. 

He pulled on shirt, trousers, 
coat and shoes. Then his fingers 
were twitching at the doorknob. 

“Broken reminders of spent 
anger most depressing,” she mur- 
mured. 

He couldn’t help himself. He 
had to call the superintendent 
to order chair, mirror and wall- 
paper replaced. He didn’t notice 
he hadn’t dialed the telephone. 

“Yessir, Mr. Blanche, yessir,” 
the superintendent said when 
Joel gave his order. 

“Have them installed by noon 
and no excuses,” Joel growled. 

“Discourtesy heavy on con- 
science,” she lisped. 



156 



GALAXY 




He slumped. He called again. 
“I won’t need the replacements 
before five,” he said wearily. “I 
am most sorry to have been cross 
and demanding.” 

“Yessir, Mr. Blanche, yessir,” 
the superintendent said. 

He would have eaten. But 
when he reached his kitchen he 
found a woman and two children 
at his table. They looked up and 
spoke, but he didn’t hear what 
they said. He backed to the door. 

Ooon he was grumbling down 
^ the street. First he would go 
to his father’s office for money. 



Then he would buy a boat and 
skis, hire an instructor and take 
Marta water skiing. He had al- 
ways wanted to take Marta wa- 
ter skiing. 

A familiar red face loomed 
from the crowd. “Joe Blanche!” 
A hand stung his shoulder. 
“How’s Trix, boy?” 

He muttered rudely. Then he 
couldn’t help himself, he had to 
stop and talk. He kept cocking 
his head but he couldn’t hear 
what the man said. Nor could he 
hear what he answered. 

Finally he was away, mutter- 
ing darkly through the crowd, 



SOFT AND SOUPY WHISPERS

cursing inside where only she 
could hear. 

“Angry, Joel?” she taunted. 
“Angry?” 

He tried to swallow his anger. 
He choked on it. 

“Anger must be spit out.” 

“I am not angry,” he snarled. 

Then he was whirling and 
smashing, crashing, crashing, 
and she was giggling inside. 
“Anger must be gotten from sys- 
tem,” she lisped. 

It was humiliating. 

Finally he was spent. He paid 
the shopkeeper for the broken 
window and merchandise and 
slunk through the crowd that 
had gathered. 

“Trix. He’s got a Trix,” some- 
one hissed. 

A small boy complained, “I 
can’t see his Trix. On telebision 
they got a bulge where the Trix 
is.” 

“Hush,” his mother said. 
“Someone loves him very much. 
That is why he has a Trix.” 

“Flappermouth kid,” Joel 
growled. Then he couldn’t help 
himself, he was peeling off his 
shirt to show the kids the scars 
on his sides where Trix was. 

She giggled and giggled. 

Had it always been this way? 
He wondered all the way to his 
father’s office, as much as he 
could wonder through her gig- 
gling. 

He was shocked, upon reach- 



ing his father’s office, to find 
that it was his own office. He 
had forgotten he had an office. 

“Money in drawer for Joel to 
have a good time,” she lisped. 

It was her first sensible idea. 
But his lips tightened when he 
found not only money but cor- 
respondence, charts, forms. 

“Bad for conscience not to 
work for money,” she whispered. 
“Father old. Help father.” 

The morning was gone, 
wasted, when he finished the pa- 
per work. “I was going to water 
ski with Marta,” he muttered. 

“Cannot enjoy play without 
first working.” 

He stood. “Next time they cut 
you out for overhaul. I’m going 
to bleed right out without you. 
You wait.” 

Outside he was almost run 
down crossing the street. She 
pulled him to the curb just in 
time. 

She giggled and giggled. “I 
leave you five seconds, you step 
in front of the truck.” 

“I am a responsible adult,” he 
said. “I can cross the street by 
myself, anytime I know I’m 
crossing by myself.” 

“Oh, foolish.” she tittered. 

Now he was approaching the 
street where he would turn to 
call for Marta for lunch. 

Unfortunately he did not turn. 
“Hey!” he protested. 

“To the mother’s for lunch,” 



158

she lisped. “The mother old and 
lonely. Needs her son.” 

“She’s got friends, hasn’t she?” 
he challenged. 

“Matchmaking difficult with- 
out male to match.” 

He drooped. He had forgotten 
again. “But Marta — ” 

“Marta most unsuitable for 
wealthy, sophisticated young ex- 
ecutive. Black-eyed pig. Some- 
day slit your throat with whiskey 
bottle. Oh, foolish, with slit 
throat.” 

\ lice was slim, cool, blonde. 

Her mother was slim, cool, 
gray. So was his. They sat at the 
luncheon table and they spoke, 
but he didn’t notice what they 
said. 

Not until Alice’s mother said, 
“Such an ingenious device, 
Trixie.” 

“She does bring out the best,” 
Joel’s mother said. “At first, 
when he was a child, and such 
an unmanageable child, she was 
so much more practical than a 
nurse. She was always there, and 
she could always make him be- 
have.” 

Alice’s mother murmured. 

“The initial cost is quite rea- 
sonable, but you must set aside 
a fund for maintenance, because 
she must be removed every year. 
Yes. When my husband passed 
on, Trixie was due for overhaul 
any day, and if we hadn’t had 



the fund we would have had to 
let her go. Because you know 
how erratic they become. The 
funniest things happen.” 

Joel sat up very straight, 
frowning. There was something 
he had forgotten to do. Some- 
thing important. 

“Oh, yes, father passed on.” 
Her voice was sticky and sweet, 
cake icing on a hot, hot day. 
“Dead many years now. Son only 
support of himself and aged 
mother.” 

He forgot to wonder what he 
had forgotten to do. He frowned, 
because he distinctly remember- 
ed that he went to his father’s 
office every day for money to 
spend on Marta. 

“Foolish boy. Father left all 
money in drawer for son. Have 
a ball, son.” 

“If you want only the best,” 
his mother said, “Trixie is the 
answer. Any parent who cares 
will tell you — get Trixie!” 

He wondered why her lips 
didn’t match her words. 

When he stood his mother 
drew him to the corridor. She 
was very erect and very distin- 
guished. “I have invited Carolyn 
and her mother for lunch tomor- 
row, Joel. You will come?” 

He nodded eagerly. Of course 
he would come. Anything for 
Mother. He kissed her forehead. 

As he left he remembered 
Marta. Tomorrow they would

lunch together. Afterward she 
would invite him to her apart- 
ment. He walked faster, smiling. 
Marta was very rich and very 
beautiful. Also she was a nym- 
phomaniac. 

He decided, I’ll go sailing this 
afternoon. 

“After hard day at office, good 
to relax. Good, Joel.” 

TTe stopped at a public tele- 
^ phone, called Robard at the 
yacht club, instructed him to 
ready a suitable craft. He didn’t 
notice that he hadn’t dialed. 



“Yessir, Mr. Blanche, yessir,” 
Robard said. 

Naturally he was disappointed 
when he found himself at his 
desk. “I have already worked,” 
he pointed out. 

“Oh selfish. Sailing when baby 
needs shoes.” She giggled. 

He opened the drawer, point- 
ed to the money. “Baby can have 
twenty pair of shoes,” he said. 

“Should not take money with- 
out working.” 

She had a point. 

“Father old. Father need help 
with office.”

He considered, then settled ab 
sently to charts and forms. 

Ten minutes later he said, sud- 
denly, frowning, “What baby?” 

She clucked. “Youngest of Joel 
and Alice. Lovely little girl with 
blonde ringlets. Unfortunately 
needs shoes before can play at 
beach with mother and brother.” 

“Oh.” He didn’t remember. 
But it was hardly worth worry- 
ing about. 

When the work was done he 
took a handful of money. But 
she clucked inside his head. So 
he put most of it back. 

He reached home at five 
o’clock and went directly to his 
bedroom. He was upset to find 
the walls and mirror still smash- 
ed. But only one splinter of 
chair lay on the carpet, and no 
glass. 

“Ah, careless.” She was con- 
trite. 

Now there were sticks of 
wrecked chair, shards of mirror, 
plaster. 

He frowned because the little 
girl with golden ringlets had 
picked up a shard of mirror to 
see her face. “The children will 
cut themselves,” he protested. 
He hated to see children bleed. 

“Ah, careless again.” 

Now there were no children. 

He was satisfied. He went to 
change. Marta was waiting. 

“Foolish Trix soon require 
overhaul,” she mourned. 



“And I’ll bleed right off with- 
out you too.” He only said it 
from habit. 

He went to the kitchen. His 
wife was working at die sink, 
blonde and efficient. “Any mail 
today?” he asked. He wished his 
mother would stop matchmak- 
ing. He had too many wives al- 
ready. 

r T~'here was a card from Mani- 
pulatrix Inc. reminding the 
patron that his unit was two 
weeks overdue for overhaul, that 
an overdue unit might become 
arratic and unpredictable, that 
an overdue unit could not be re- 
lied upon to remind the patron 
that overhaul was due, that Man- 
ipulatrix Inc. could not assume 
responsibility for damages in- 
curred by an overdue unit. 

He kissed the cook, who had 
a wart on her nose. “Any mail 
today?” 

“Nossir, Mr. Blanche,” she 
said. 

He ate dinner with the cook 
and her two children. Then he 
went to take Marta to dinner. He 
was very hungry. 

On the way he stopped and 
bought seven pair of shoes for 
the cook’s youngest daughter. He 
sent the shoes to the apartment 
by special messenger, enclosing 
a card which read, “With all re- 
spects, from my father and his 
wife.”

Unfortunately he spent the 
evening in a gymnasium super- 
vising boys’ calisthenics. He was 
not at all happy but he couldn’t 
remember why. 

Before he left he reminded 
Berry, a good kid, ten years old, 
to go to Joel’s mother and let 
her fix him up with Joel’s young- 
est daughter, who had golden 
ringlets but no shoes. 

“Gee, that’s too bad, Mr. 
Blanche,” Berry said. 

Joel nodded solemnly, walked 
u- the wall and out the window. 

He was disappointed upon 
reaching home to find that the 
cook had bedded her horse in 
his bed. He roused the cook’s 
youngest daughter. She came 
with a whip and drove the horse 
through the mirror. 

But Joel didn’t sleep well, 
what with horsehair in the bed 
and Trix mourning. 

Sometime during the night he 
heard a faint click, and then he 
was filled with silence. He felt 
completely alone ir the dark, 
and it made him uneasy. 

T T e awoke sticky and tired but 
^ *■ got up anyway and went to 
the window. There was nothing 
to see except the building op- 
posite and, far below, a patch 
of green that might have been 
grass. Unsatisfied, he went to his 
closet, dressed and went to the 
kitchen. 



There he dialed breakfast, and 
his wife talked to him. She told 
him what she had done the day 
before and what she would do 
today. Also she told him what 
the children had done the day 
before and what they would do 
today. 

Later he went down the eleva- 
tor. It was convenient, working 
in the very building he lived in. 
It was also convenient having the 
schools, recreation centers and 
shopping facilities in the same 
building. He never had to go out- 
side. 

He reached his floor and 
walked past rows of partitioned 
spaces to his own. It was con- 
venient having the machines do 
his work. He had only to push 
buttons and watch three rows of 
lights. 

Because he had nothing else 
to do he began remembering 
things. He remembered a man in 
white telling his mother, years 
before, “Your son is constitu- 
tionally unsuited to the mono- 
tony of modem industrial life. 
He is also incapable of inventing 
a satisfying vicarious life for 
himself. He will continue crawl- 
ing out ledges and sniping in 
the halls until you take action. 
I recommend a Manipulatrix 
unit. They’re safely installed, re- 
latively inexpensive, and they 
keep the individual disciplined 
and emotionally satisfied.” 



162 



GALAXY 



He remembered the day they 
had wanted to take him to have 
the unit installed. He had crawl- 
ed so far out the ledge that they 
had had to wait until the next 
day. 

He remembered the same man 
telling his mother, “The major 
expense involved in the purchase 
of a Manipulatrix is the pre- 
paid fee for annual overhaul. 
The unit, after a year’s wear, 
may begin to assume your son’s 
undesirable characteristics — il- 
logic, desire for sensation and 
conquest. Or it may simply stop 
functioning. In any case, it must 
be removed annually, overhaul- 
ed and reinstalled. This is the 
unit’s only undesirable charac- 
teristic.” 

He worked until lunch, when 
he went down one floor and ate. 
He didn’t have to pay. He had 
only to sign. Anytime he spent 
too much, the machines simply 
raised his pay. 

He went back and worked un- 
til two o’clock, when he began 
to wonder if he could crawl 
down inside one of the machines 
without getting both of his legs 
cut off. 

He went to see. 

At three o’clock they hoisted 
him from the machine with a 
giant vacuum nozzle. He kicked 
so vigorously they had to spray 
him asleep. Then the supervisor 
notified Manipulatrix Inc., and 



Manipulatrix Inc. sent a capsule 
for him. 

TTe awoke in his own bed, and 
A -*■ her voice was cool and 
milky, asking if he was ready to 
get up. He slid out of bed for her, 
yawned and tried to stretch, but 
his sides hurt when he raised his 
arms. She murmured sympathy. 

He grinned as he leaned out 
of the window to watch the traf- 
fic. He had a notion to walk 
out the ledge, like a kid, 
just to see if he could do it. 

“Foolish, foolish.” Her voice 
admired more than it admonish- 
ed. 

He laughed and went to the 
kitchen. 

“Start the day the healthful 
way, with fresh, wholesome 
eggs,” she said. But she wasn’t 
stuffy about it. 

He nodded appreciatively. 
Here was a woman with sense. 
Then he fixed breakfast because 
he didn’t want to wake his wife. 

Later he would run down to 
the office, give Pop a hand. The 
old boy was too old to run the 
whole shebang himself. He 
didn’t mind helping. That left 
the entire afternoon for. 

But he was careful not to think 
details. He sometimes suspected 
his wife of reading his mind. 
And no wife was likely to under- 
stand about Marta.

and holy chamber! How intense 
would be their assembled hatred, 
focused on him! 

He was on the ground floor 
of the castle and in the Room 
of the Hero-Fathers. A hundred 
feet square, it was at this mo- 
ment lit by a few electric flam- 
beaux. A tremendous fireplace 



164 




THE BLASPHEMERS 



was at one end. In it, in the old 
days, the greatest enemy of the 
Wazaga, Ziitii of the Uruba clan, 
had been burned alive after the 
Battle of Taaluu. Above the 
mantel were the trophies of that 
battle: swords, shields, lances, 
maces and several flintlock blun- 
derbusses. 

Beyond this room, deeper in 
the castle, was a room decorated 
with the accumulated trophies of 
a thousand years. Beyond that 
was another in which the skulls 
and preserved heads of fallen 
enemies stared out from niches, 
above plates bearing their 
names and the date and place 
of death. Nowadays, the door to 
the room was kept locked out of 
deference to modern sensibili- 
ties. It was opened only to his- 
torians and anthropologists or 
during the clan Initiations, the 
Greeting of the Ghosts. 

Three nights ago, Jagu had 
been locked for twelve hours, all 
alone in that room. 

That was the trouble, thought 
Jagu, as he turned away and 
walked softly on four bare paws 
towards the dark anteroom. The 
Ghosts, the Hero-Fathers, had 
not greeted him. There had not 
been any. 

He could not tell his four par- 
ents that. It was impossible to 
acknowledge that his ancestors 
had scorned him, that they 
thought him unworthy of the 



name of joma — “man.” Not that 
he thought that the Heroes had 
scorned him. 

What does not exist cannot 
scorn. 

His parents did not know that. 
They had been elated because 
he had been one of the few to 
graduate from the space-navy 
Academy of Vaagii. They were 
happy to put their eldest son 
through the long-awaited initia- 
tion into adulthood. But they 
had not been so happy when he 
said that he was not yet ready 
to choose a group-mate from the 
eligible members of the clan. 
All four had pleaded with him, 
threatened him, stormed. He 
must get married before he left 
for the stars. He must ensure 
the perpetuation of their line, 
leave many eggs in the hatchery 
before he assumed his duties as 
a spacer. 

Jagu had said n,. 

Now, he was sneaking out late 
at night, and he had run the 
gauntlet of the twelve thousand. 
But . they were only squares of 
canvas or wood on which vari- 
ous colored oils had been ar- 
ranged in different patterns. 
That was all. 

He paused by a tall wall- 
mirror. The lights behind him 
shone gloomily in it. He looked 
like a ghost stepping out of the 
dark past towards himself, and 
where his two selves met .

GALAXY 



Qix and a half feet tall he 
^ stood. His vertical torso was 
humanoid. At a distance, and in 
a dim light, if all but the for- 
ward breasts upwards had been 
hidden, he could have been mis- 
taken for a human being. But 
his pinkish skin was hidden up 
to the neck with a golden pile 
of short curling hairs. The head 
was very broad and round and 
massively boned. The cheek- 
bones bulged like bosses on a 
shield. The jawbone was very 
thick; the deeply cleft chin was 
a prow. (The latter was another 
sore point. His parents did not 
like it that he had shaved off 
the goatee.) 

The nose was bulbous and 
covered with tiny bristling 
blackish hairs. The supraorbital 
ridges flared out Gothicly. The 
eyes beneath were large, hazel 
and rimmed with a half -inch 
wide circle of brown hair. The 
ears were shaped like a cat’s, and 
the yellow hair on top of his 
head stood straight up. 

At the base of the spine of his 
upper torso was a device of 
bone, a natural universal joint 
that permitted the upper torso 
a ninety-degree description for- 
ward. The lower torso was quad- 
rupedal, as if he had only half- 
evolved. The legs and paws were 
lion-shaped; his long tail was 
tufted at the end with black hair. 

Jagu had the normal vanity 



of a youth. He thought he was 
rather good-looking, and he did 
not mind examining himself. 
The string of diamonds hanging 
from around his neck was mag- 
nificent, as was also the gold 
plate at its end. On the plate was 
a design formed of diamonds in 
the shape of a lightning streak, 
his totem. 

Though he enjoyed the view, 
he could not stay there fbrever. 
He passed through a double- 
pointed arch into the anteroom. 
As he neared the door, he saw 
a big mound of fur rise and 
shake itself and slowly form into 
a six-legged animal with a long 
bushy tail, a sharp pointed nose, 
and great round scarlet ears. The 
rest of the siygeygey was, ex- 
cept for the black nose and round 
black eyes, a chocolate brown. 

It rumbled in its massive 
chest. Then, recognizing Jagu 
with its nose, it whined a little 
and wagged its tail. 

Jagu patted it and said, “Go 
back to sleep, Aa. I’m not tak- 
ing you hunting tonight.” 

The animal slumped into 
amorphous shagginess. Jagu 
pointed the key at the lock and 
pressed on the end. 

Just after dinner, he had deft- 
ly removed the key from its 
hook on the belt of Timo. Since 
another parent, Washagi, had 
locked the front door, Timo had 
not missed the key. 



THE BLASPHEMERS 



167 



Jagu regretted having to do 
this, though he did get a thrill 
out of being a successful pick- 
pocket. But he saw no sense in 
the custom of refusing a youth 
his own key until he had be- 
come married. He wanted to go 
out late that night. If he could 
not get permission, he would go 
without it. 

# T'he door swung open. He step- 
ped quickly outside, and the 
door closed. 

Ten years ago he would have 
had to bribe or sneak past the 
Watcher of the Door. Now door- 
men were of the past. They 
could make more money work- 
ing in the factories. The last of 
the family retainers had died 
some years ago; his place was 
taken by an electronic device. 

A full late-summer moon 
shone at zenith. It cast green- 
silver nets everywhere and 
caught shadows gaunt and gro- 
tesque. These were the towering 
diorite statues of the greatest 
Heroes on the broad lawn, the 
hundred-odd whose fighting 
fury had made the name of 
Wazaga famous. 

He did not pause to look at 
•them, for he feared that an awe 
and dread left over from child- 
hood might influence him. In- 
stead he looked upward, where 
a score of joma-made satellites 
raced brightly across the night 



sky. He thought of the hundreds 
he could not see, of the space- 
navy ships patrolling the reaches 
between the planets of the sys- 
tem, and of the few interstellar 
ships out there, probing the 
galaxy. 

“What a contrast!” he mur- 
mured. “On this earth, sdumb 
stone sculptures rule the minds 
of a people who can go to the 
stars!” 

He walked into a dark spot 
at the foot of the castle wall, 
an opening to a tunnel that led 
at a sharp slope downward. For- 
merly this area had been the 
moat. Then the moat was filled 
in. Later the excavation was dug 
and lined with cement. At its 
end lay the underground garage. 

Here Jagu used the key to 
open the door again, and he en- 
tered. He did not hesitate mak- 
ing a choice among the six 
vehicles. He wanted the long 
low sleek Firebird. This was last 
year’s model, one electric motor 
per wheel, one hundred horse- 
power per motor, stick-con- 
trolled, with a bubble-top, hold- 
ing four passengers. It was 
painted fiery red. 

Jagu lifted the bubble-top and 
stepped over the low side onto 
the floor. He squatted down be- 
hind the instrument panel, his 
rump against a thick cushion at- 
tached to a vertical steel plate. 
Then he pulled the bubble 



168 



GALAXY 



down. This was secured by mag- 
netic clamps to the chassis. A 
separate and small motor pro- 
vided the power for the electro- 
magnets. 

He flicked a toggle switch, 
and the on indicator lit up. The 
big hydrogen tank was full. He 
pulled out the sliding panel 
with its three small sticks and 
pushed forward on one. 

Silently the Firebird rolled 
forward and up the ramp. As 
its rear cleared the garage, Jagu 
pressed a button and the iris of 
the garage door closed. The Fire- 
bird cruised down the driveway, 
past the stone ancestors and 
then turned to the right onto 
the private highway. This led 
him winding through the forest 
of wexa (scarlet pinoids) for 
about a mile. Only when he 
turned onto the public highway, 
which inclined downwards at 
this point, did he push the 
speed-stick forward as far as it 
would go. The column of the 
velocity indicator, an instru- 
ment like a thermometer, show- 
ed 135 mph attained in twenty 
seconds. 

II 

TTe shot up and over the top 
of the hill and had to swerve 
violently to the left to pass a 
big cargo truck. But there were 
no approaching lights, and his 



horn, honking like a goose, an- 
swered the truckdriver’s furious 
blasts. 

He wished that these were the 
old days. Then when an aristo- 
crat wanted to travel without 
obstacle he notified the police. 
They went ahead to clear the 
road. Now, to keep the ancient 
privilege in force would disrupt 
the heavy flow of commerce. 
Business came first; so he must 
take his chances like any one 
else. He was not, like his ances- 
tors, immune from arrest if he 
ran over someone or forced 
somebody off the road. He was 
even supposed to obey the speed 
laws. Usually he did . but to- 
night he did not feel like it. 

He passed a dozen other ve- 
hicles, several of them the old 
internal -combustion type. After 
traveling for several miles, he 
slowed enough to turn onto an- 
other private road with some 
screeching of tires and fishtail- 
ing. 

He drove for a quarter of a 
mile, then stopped. Here he 
picked up Alaku. They gave 
each other a brief kiss. Alaku 
then jumped into the car beside 
Jagu and braced his rump against 
the plate; the bubble closed, the 
car turned around and they sped 
away. 

Alaku unhooked a flask from 
his belt, unscrewed the top and 
offered Jagu a drink. Jagu stuck 



THE BLASPHEMERS 



169 



his tongue out, signifying a nega- 
tive reply, so Alaku tipped the 
bottle to his own lips. 

After gulping several times 
he said, “My parents were after 
me again to know why I didn’t 
pick a mate-group.” 

“So?” 

“So I suggested that I marry 
you and Fawani and Tuugee. 
You should have heard the gasp- 
ing, the choking, seen the red 
faces, the bristling tails, the fly- 
ing fingers. And heard the 
words! I calmed them down 
somewhat by telling them that 
I was only joking, of course. 
Nevertheless, I had to hear a 
long and hot lecture on the de- 
generacy of modern youth, its 
flippancy, its near-blasphemy. 
On how humor was a very good 
thing, but there were some 
things too sacred to joke about. 
And so on and on. If the lower 
classes wanted to forget about 
clan distinctions and marry just 
anybody, that was to be expect- 
ed. What with increasing indus- 
trialization, anc^ urbanization, 
mass migrations, modem mobil- 
ity and so forth, the proletariat 
couldn’t keep the clan lines 
straight. And it did not matter 
with them. But with us joru- 
tama, the aristoi, it mattered 
very much. Where would socie- 
ty. religion, government, etc., 
be if the great clans let every- 
thing slide into chaos? Especial- 

17C 



ly, if our clan, the Two-Fanged 
Eagles, set a bad example for 
the rest? You’ve heard the same 
thing.” 

Jagu sucked his breath in- 
wards sharply with assent, and 
said, “A million times. Only I’m 
afraid I shocked my parents 
even more. Questioning marri- 
age lines is bad enough. But to 
suggest that belief in ancestral 
ghosts just might — just barely 
might — not be true, might be 
a hangover from the old super- 
stitious days . well, you’ve no 
idea of outraged parenthood un- 
til you’ve hinted at that. I had 
to undergo a ceremonial puri- 
fication — an expensive one for 
the family and a tiring one for 
me. Also I had to spend four 
hours locked up in a cell in the 
dungeon, and I had to listen to 
sermons and prayers piped into 
my cell. No way of turning the 
abominable stuff off. But the 
chanting did help me to sleep.” 
“Poor Jagu,” said Alaku, and 
he patted Jagu’s arm. 

A few minutes later they 
hurtled over a hilltop and 
saw, a mile away at the bottom 
of the long hill, twin beams of 
light from a car parked by the 
roadside. 

Jagu pulled up alongside the 
car. Two got out of it and walk- 
ed into his Firebird: Fawani 
and Tuugee. Fawani of the Tree 

GALAXY 



Lion clan and Tuugee of the 
Split-tongue Dragons. All gave 
each other a kiss. Then, Jagu 
drove back to the highway and, 
in a short time, had it whistling 
at full speed. 

“Where are we meeting to- 
night?” said Tuugee. “I didn’t 
get the message until late. Fa- 
wani phoned, but I had to make 
small talk and avoid saying any- 
thing about tonight. I think my 
parents are monitoring my calls. 
The Dragons have always had 
a reputation for excessive suspi- 
ciousness. In this case, they’ve 
good reason to be — though I 
hope they don’t know it.” 

‘We’re going to the Siikii 
Monument tonight,” said Jagu. 

The others gasped. “You mean 
where the great battle was 
fought?” said Alaku. “Where 
our ancestors who fell in that 
battle are buried? Where. 

“Where the ghosts congregate 
every night and slay those who 
dare walk among them?” said 
Jagu. 

“But that’s asking for it!” said 
Fawani. 

“So we ask for it,” said Jagu. 
“You don’t really believe in all 
that tripe? Or do you? If so, 
you’d better get out now. Go 
home, ask at once for a ritual 
cleansing, take your beating. 
What we’ve done so far has been 
enough to stir up the ghosts — 
if any exist.” 



There was silence for a mo- 
ment. Then Fawani said, “Pass 
the bottle, Alaku. I’ll drink to 
defiance to the ghosts and to our 
everlasting love.” 

Jagu’s laugh was hollow. H« 
said, “A good toast, Fawani. But 
you’d better drink one to Waa- 
tii, the Hero of Speed. We’re go- 
ing to need his blessing, if he 
exists. Here comes a cop!” 

The others turned to see what 
Jagu had detected in his rear- 
view mirror. About a mile be- 
hind them, a yellow light was 
flashing off and on. Jagu flicked 
on a switch which brought in 
outside noises and turned the 
amplifier control. Now they 
could hear the barking of the 
highway patrolman’s siren. 

“One more ticket, and my par- 
ents will take the Firebird away 
from me,” said Jagu. “Hang on.” 

TTe pressed a button. A light 
^ on the instrument panel lit 
up to indicate that shields were 
being lowered over the license 
plates. 

He took the Firebird around 
a passenger vehicle, his horn 
blaring, while the approaching 
beams of another grew larger 
and larger. Just before collision 
seemed imminent, while the oth- 
ers in his car had broken into 
terrified calls to the ghosts of 
their ancestors to save them, he 
whipped in front of the car just

passed. The cry of tires burning 
on the pavement came to them, 
and the gabble of the car they 
had just missed ramming keened 
away. 

His passengers said nothing; 
they were too frightened to pro- 
test. Besides, they knew that 
Jagu would pay no attention to 
them. He would kill them and 
himself rather than allow them 
to be caught. And actually it was 
better to die than be exposed 
to a public scandal, the recrimi- 
nations of their parents and the 
ritual cleansing. 

Jagu drove for half a mile and 
overtook a lumbering semi-trail- 
er. He could not pass on the left, 
for a string of twin beams, too 
near, told him that he would 
have to wait. If he did, the pa- 
trolman would be on them. So 
he passed on the right, on the 
shoulder of the road. Without 
slowing. 

Fortunately the shoulder was 
comparatively smooth and wide. 
Just wide enough for the Fire- 
bird; an inch away from the 
right wheels, the shoulder fell 
off and began to slope ever more 
towards the perpendicular. At 
the bottom of the hill was a 
creek, silvery in the moonlight. 
It ran along a heavily wooded 
slope. 4 

Alaku, looking out the bubble 
at the nearness of the hill, 
groaned. Then he lifted the 



bottle to his lips again. By the 
time he had taken a few deep 
swallows, Jagu had pulled around 
the truck. 

Fawani, looking behind him, 
saw the patrol car pull up be- 
hind the truck. Then one beam 
appeared as the car began to 
make the same maneuver as 
Jagu’s. But it disappeared; the 
cop had changed his mind and 
swung in behind the truck. 

“He’ll radio ahead,” said Fa- 
wani. “Do you mean to crash a 
roadblock?” 

“If I have to,” said Jagu cheer- 
ily. “But the entrance to the 
Siikii Monument is only a half 
mile down the road.” 

“The cop’ll know where we 
turned in,” said Alaku. 

Jagu switched off the lights, 
and they sped at 135 mph along 
the moonlit highway. He began 
to slow after a few seconds, but 
they were still traveling at 60 
mph when he took the sideroad. 

For a moment, all were sure 
that they were going to over- 
turn — all except Jagu. He had 
practiced making this turn at 
least twenty times, and he knew 
exactly what he could do. He 
skidded, but he brought the 
Firebird out of it just in time 
to keep the rear from sideswip- 
ing a large tree. Then he was 
back on the road and building 
up speed on the narrow, tree- 
lined pavement. 



172 



GALAXY 



This time he stopped acceler- 
ating at 90 mph and drove for 
a half mile, taking the twists and 
turns with the ease of much 
practice and familiarity with 
this road. 

Suddenly he began slowing the 
car. 

In another half mile, he had 
turned off the road and plunged 
into what looked to the others 
like a solid mass of trees. But 
there was a space between the 
trees, an aisle just wide enough 
for the Firebird to pass through 
without scraping the paint off 
the sides. And at the end of the 
dark aisle, another which turn- 
ed at a forty-five degree angle. 
Jagu drove the car into the 
space there and turned off the 
power. 

nphey sat there, breathing heav- 
ily, looking off through the 
trees. 

From here they could not see 
the road itself, but they could 
see the flashing yellow of the 
patrol car as it sped down the 
road toward the Siikii Monu- 
ment. 

“Isn’t there danger he’ll see 
the others there?” said Fawani. 

“Not if they hid their cars like 
I told them to,” said Jagu. He 
released the bubble, lifted it 
and jumped out of the car. Rais- 
ing the trunk cover in the rear 
of the car, he said, “Give me a 



hand. I’ve got something to fool 
him when he comes back look- 
ing for our tracks on the road- 
side.” 

They climbed out and helped 
him lift a tightly rolled mass of 
green stuff. Under his orders, 
they carried it back to the point 
on the road at which they had 
turned off. After unrolling the 
stuff, they spread it out over the 
car tracks and smoothed it. 

When they were done the area 
looked like smooth grass. There 
were even a few wild flowers — 
or what looked like wild flowers 
— sprouting up here and there 
among the grasses. Presently, 
from their hiding places behind 
trees, they saw the patrol car 
moving slowly back, its search- 
light probing along the dirt and 
grass beside the pavement. 

It passed, and soon they could 
see its lights no more. 

Jagu gave the word, and they 
rolled the counterfeit grass into 
a tight bundle. Jagu had driven 
the car backward to the road- 
side while they were doing that. 
They placed the roll in the 
trunk, climbed back in, and 
Jagu drove off toward the Mon- 
ument. 

As they went along the twist- 
ing road, Fawani said, “If we 
hadn’t been driving too fast, we 
could have avoided all this.” 

“And missed a lot of fun,” 
said Jagu. 



THE BLASPHEMERS 



173 



“The rest of you still don’t 
understand,” said Alaku. “Jagu 
doesn’t care if we live or die. 
In fact, I sometimes think he’d 
just as soon die. Then his prob- 
lems — and ours — would be 
over. Besides, he wants to make 
some sort of gesture at our par- 
ents and the society they re- 
present — even if it’s only out- 
running a cop.” 

“Alaku’s the cool, objective 
one,” said Jagu. “He sits to one 
side and dissects the situation 
and the people involved. But, 
despite his often correct analy- 
sis, he never does anything about 
it. The Eternal Spectator.” 

“I’m not a leader,” said Alaku 
somewhat coldly. “But I can 
take as much action as the next 
person. So far, I’ve participated 
quite fully. Have I ever failed 
to follow you?” 

“No,” said Jagu. “I apologize. 
I spoke from the back of my 
head. You know me; always too 
impulsive.” 

“No apology needed,” said 
Alaku, his voice warming. 

Ill 

r T"hen they were at the gateway 
to the Siikii Monument. Jagu 
drove the car past it and under 
some trees across the road. Oth- 
er vehicles were parked there. 
“All seven here,” he said. 

They recrossed the road to a 



point about forty yards south of 
the main gate. Jagu called soft- 
ly. A voice replied softly; and 
a moment later a flexible plas- 
tic rope was thrown over the 
gate. 

Jagu was pulled up the twen- 
ty-feet high stone wall first, 
with much difficulty because of 
the leocentauroid construction 
of his body. On the other side, 
he found Ponu of the Greentail 
Shrike clan waiting for him. 
They embraced. 

After the others had descend- 
ed and the rope was pulled back 
over the wall, they walked soft- 
ly toward the assignation point. 
The stone statues of their great 
and glorious ancestors stared 
down at them. These were de- 
dicated to the fallen of the 
Battle of Siikii, the last major 
conflict of the last civil war of 
their nation. That had occurred 
one hundred and twenty years 
before, and the ancestors of 
some of those assembled tonight 
had fought and slain each other 
then. It was this war that had 
killed off so many of the aristoi 
that the lower classes had been 
able to demand certain rights 
and privileges denied them. It 
was also this war that had ac- 
celerated the growth of the 
fledgling Industrial Age. 

The youths walked past the 
frowning Heroes and the pillars 
that marked various heroic ex- 



174

ploits during the battle. All but 
Juga showed a restraint in the 
overwhelming presence of the 
heads. He chattered away in a 
low but confident voice. Before 
they had reached the center of 
the Monument, the others were 
also talking and even laughing. 

Here, in the center, where the 
battle had been decided, was the 
most sacred of all sites in this 
area. Here was the colossal stat- 
ue of Joma, the eponymous an- 
cestor of the joma species. 

The statue was carved out of 
a single mass of diorite and 
painted with colors that imi- 
tated those of the living joma. 
It had no upper torso nor arms, 
only the head and neck attach- 
ed to the quadrupedal body. The 
holy scriptures of the joma, the 
Book of Mako, said that Joma 
had once been like his descend- 
ants. But in return for the pow- 
er of sentience and for the priv- 
ilege of seeing his young become 
the dominant species of this 
world, and eventually of the 
universe, he had surrendered his 
arms, become like a crippled 
beast. Pleased by this sacrifice, 
Tuu-God had allowed Joma to 
reproduce parthenogenetically, 
without the aid of the other 
three mates. (Since Joma was the 
surviving member of his kind 
after Tuu had, in a fit of righ- 
teous anger, killed most beings, 
Joma had no other partners.) 



It was here that Jagu had de- 
cided to hold the love feast. He 
could not have picked a place 
more appropriate to show his 
contempt for the ghosts and for 
the beliefs that the entire popu- 
lation of the planet held sacred. 

Jagu and his friends greeted 
those waiting for them. Drinks 
were passed around along with 
jests. Ponu was that night’s ad- 
ministrator. He had spread the 
carpets and placed the food and 
drinks on them — eight carpets, 
and four joruma sat on each. 

As the night passed, and the 
moon reached its zenith and be- 
gan to sink, the talking and 
laughing became louder and 
thicker. Then Jagu took a large 
bottle from Ponu, unscrewed the 
cap and went among the group. 
He gave each one a large pill 
from the bottle. Each swallow- 
ed it under his watchful eye. 
They made faces of repulsion, 
and Fawani almost threw his up. 
But he managed to keep it down 
when Jagu threatened to ram it 
down with his paw if Fawani 
didn’t do the job himself. 

After that Jagu made a mock 
prayer to Mako, a parody of the 
one that newly married quartets 
made to their particular house- 
hold clan-Hero of Fertility. He 
ended by taking a swig from a 
bottle of wine and then smash- 
ing the bottle against the face 
of Joma. 



THE BLASPHEMERS 



175 



A n hour later the first round 
of the love feast had been 
completed. The participants 
were resting, getting ready for 
the next round, and discussing 
the beauty and the minor dis- 
appointments of the last con- 
gress. 

A whistle blew shrilly. 

Jagu sprang to his feet. “The 
cops!” he said. “All right, every- 
body, don’t panic! Get your 
headpieces and breastplates. 
Don’t bother to put them on yet. 
Leave the carpets here; they 
haven’t got any clan insignias 
on them. Follow me!” 

The statue of Joma stood on 
a small hill in the center of the 
Monument. It was this advantage 
in viewing that had determined 
Jagu’s choice of site, in addition 
to his purpose in making the 
greatest blasphemy of all. He 
could see that the main gateway 
was open, and several cars with 
beams burning had just come 
through it. There were three 
other gates; all but one was also 
open and cars coming through 
them. Probably, he thought, that 
gate had been left closed to lure 
them toward it. Once over it, 
they would find the police wait- 
ing for them beside the wall. 

But if this were a trap, then 
the police would have observed 
them hide their cars in the 
brush. That meant that even if 
he and his friends eluded the 



cops, they would all have a long 
long walk home. A useless walk, 
because the police would have 
no trouble determining and 
finding the owners. 

There was a chance that this 
was not a prepared ambush. 
The patrolman who had chased 
them might have been suspi- 
cious and brought back other 
police. They could have climbed 
the walls, seen the group under 
Joma and decided to swoop in 
now. If so, it was also possible 
that they did not have enough 
personnel to come in through all 
the gates. 

The unguarded fourth gate 
could be an escape route. 

Almost he decided to make a 
run for the closed gate. But if 
he did so, and he was wrong, 
he would lead his friends to 
ruin. Whereas he had prepared 
some time ago a hiding place 
within the Monument grounds 
itself. 

It would be foolish to take a 
chance on an unknown when he 
had something that was nearly 
one hundred per cent sure. 

“Follow me to Ngiizaa!” he 
said. “Run, but don’t panic. If 
anyone falls or gets into diffi- 
culty, call out. We’ll stop to help 
you.” 

H e began running; behind him 
was the thud of paws and 
the harsh breathing of stress.

They went down the hill on 
the side opposite the main gate- 
way and toward the granite 
statue of the Hero Ngiizaa. Jagu 
looked around and noted that 
the other statues should hide 
them from the approaching po- 
licemen. He had chosen Ngiizaa 
because there was a ring of 
statues around it, marking where 
Ngiizaa had fallen inside a pile 
of his enemy’s bodies. It took 
sixty seconds to get there from 
the center of the Monument, 
plenty of time to open the trap- 
door at the base of Ngiizaa and 
for all of them to crowd into 
the hole beneath. 

Over a year ago, Jagu and 
some of the others, working on 
moonless or cloudy nights, had 
dug out the hole. Then they had 
placed the beams which sup- 
ported the trapdoor and put sod 
over it. The trapdoor was solid; 
he and five others had stood on 
it to test its weight and make 
sure that, on the days when 
crowds came to visit, the door 
would not betray its presence by 
bending. 

Now he and three others be- 
gan rolling the sod back. The 
strip was narrow; it did not take 
long to do the job. Then, while 
he held the door up, the others 
jumped into the hole beneath 
and went to the back of the hole 
to make room for those follow- 
ing. 



By the time all except him- 
self were in, the police cars had 
reached the center. Their search- 
lights began probing the Monu- 
ment. 

He had to drop down and lie 
motionless while several beams 
in turn sprayed the circle of 
statues. When they had passed 
he leaped up. Alaku, below, held 
the trapdoor up just far enough 
for him to squeeze through. He 
had replaced the sod on top of 
it. 

This was the ticklish part of 
the whole procedure. No one 
could be left above to smooth 
the sod and make sure that the 
ragged edges did not show. But 
he did not think that the police 
could conceive of such a hiding 
place. When they started to 
make a search on paw, using 
their flashlights, they would ex- 
pect to flush out the members 
of the party from behind indi- 
vidual statues. Their lights 
would play swiftly over the 
grass; they would be looking for 
youths lying flat on the grass, 
not for hidden trapdoors. 

It was hot and crowded in the 
hole. Jagu hoped they would 
not have to wait too long. Zotu 
had a mild case of claustropho- 
bia. If he started to panic, he’d 
have to be knocked out for the 
good of everybody. 

The luminous face of his wrist- 
watch showed 15:32. He’d give 



THE BLASPHEMERS 



177 



■John (?wnta 63 

the cops an hour to search be- 
fore deciding that the party had 
somehow gotten over the wall 
and away. After that, he would 
lead his friends out of the hole. 
If the police had not left some- 
body to watch the road, or if 
they did not make a determined 
search of the woods nearby and 
found the hidden cars, then all 
would go well. Many ifs . but 
it was exciting. 

A few minutes later, some- 
hody stepped hard on the trap- 
door. 

Jagu suppressed a groan. If 
the cop heard the hollow sound 
. but that was unlikely. They 
should be shouting at each other. 

There was another rap as if 

178 



somebody were stomping his feet 
on the trapdoor. Then, while he 
held his breath and hoped the 
others would not cough or make 
any other noise, he heard some- 
thing grate against wood. 

The next moment, the door 
swung up slowly. A harsh voice 
said. “All right boys. The game’s 
up. Come on out. Don’t try any- 
thing. We’ll shoot you.” 

IV 

L ater, in the cell, when he had 
time to think, Jagu wished 
that he had resisted. How much 
better to have been killed than 
to go through this! 

He was in a small cell and 

jALAXY 





alone. He had been there for he 
did not know how long. There 
were no windows, his watch had 
been taken away and he had no 
one to talk to. 

Three meals were given to 
him through a little swinging 
door at the bottom of the large 
door. The tray was bolted to the 
door, and the food was placed 
in depressions. There was no 
cutlery; he had to eat with his 
fingers. Fifteen minutes after the 
tray swung inwards, it began to 
withdraw. No amount of tugging 
on his part could keep it from 
moving. 

The cell itself was furnished 
simply. The bed was bolted to 
the floor and without blankets 



or pillows. There was a wash- 
bowl and an airblower with 
which to dry himself, and a hole 
in the floor to receive refuse. 
The walls were padded . He 
could not commit suicide if he 
wished to. 

Sometime after the third meal, 
while he paced back and forth 
and wondered what punishment 
he would have to endure, what 
his companions were going 
through, what his parents knew 
and felt, the door opened. 

It did so silently; he was not 
aware of it until he turned to 
pace back toward it. Two sol- 
diers — not police — entered. Si- 
lently they escorted him out of 
the cell. 



THE BLASPHEMERS 



179 



Neither were armed, but he 
had the feeling that they knew 
all about bare-hand-and-paw- 
fighting, that they were experi- 
enced and that he would get 
badly hurt if he tried to attack 
them. He had no such intention. 
Not until he saw his way clear, 
anyway. As long as he was in- 
side a building new to him, one 
that must be equipped with 
closed-circuit TV and electronic 
beams, he would be quiet. 

Meanwhile. 

TJ e was taken down a long 
corridor and into an eleva- 
tor. 

The elevator was some time 
rising, but he had no way of 
telling how many stories they 
had gone up. Then it stopped, 
and he was taken down another 
long hall and then another. Fi- 
nally they stopped before a door 
on which was incised, in the 
florid syllabary of a century 
ago, Tagimi Tiipaaroozuu. Head 
of Criminal Detection. Arigi, 
the man responsible for detec- 
tion and arrest of criminals of 
stature, conducted his business 
here. Jagu knew him, for Arigi 
had been among the elders pres- 
ent at his Initiation. He was a 
fellow clansman. 

Though Jagu’s knees shook, 
he swore he would show no fear. 
When he was marched in, he 
knew that he would have to re- 



mind himself constantly that he 
was not afraid. Arigi sat on his 
haunches behind a huge crescent- 
shaped desk of polished bird 
wood. He had a cold hard face 
that was made even more un- 
readable by the dark glasses he 
wore. On his head was the four- 
cornered tall-crowned hat of the 
High Police. His arms were cov- 
ered with bracelets, most of 
which had been awarded him by 
the government for various serv- 
ices. In his right hand was a 
stiletto with a jeweled handle. 

“It may interest you, fledg- 
ling,” he said in a dry voice, 
pointing the stiletto at Jagu, 
“that you are the first of your 
fellows to be interviewed. The 
rest are still in their cells, won- 
dering when the trial will com- 
mence. 

“Tell me,” he said so sharply 
that Jagu could not help flinch- 
ing, “when did you first decide 
that the ghosts of your ances- 
tors did not exist? Except as a 
primitive superstition, figments 
in the minds of fools?” 

Jagu had decided not to deny 
any accusation that was true. If 
he were to suffer, so much the 
worse. But he would not degrade 
himself by lying or pleading. 

“I’ve always thought so,” he 
said. “When I was a child I may 
have believed in the existence 
of the spirits of my ancestors. 
But I do not remember it. 



180 



GALAXY 



“And you were intelligent 
enough not to proclaim this dis- 
belief publicly,” said Arigi. He 
seemed to relax a trifle. But 
Jagu was sure that Arigi was 
hoping he too, would relax so 
that he could spring at him, 
catch him off guard. 

He wondered if his words 
were being recorded, his image 
being shown on a screen to his 
judges. He doubted that his trial 
for blasphemy would be made 
public. It would reflect too 
much discredit and dishonor on 
his clan, and they were power- 
ful enough to suppress these 
things. Perhaps they might even 
have him in here merely to 
scare him, to make him repent. 
Then he would be let off with 
a reprimand or, more likely, be 
assigned to a desk job. Forever 
earthbound. 

But no, blasphemy was not 
merely a crime against the peo- 
ple of this planet. It was a spit 
in the face of his ancestors. 
Only pain and blood could wipe 
out that insult; the ghosts would 
crowd around him while he 
screamed over a fire and would 
lap at the blood flowing from 
his wounds. 

A rigi smiled as if he now had 
Jagu where he wanted him. 
He said, “Well, at least you’re 
a cool one. You act as a Wazaga 
should. So far, anyway. Tell me, 



do all your friends also deny 
the existence of an afterlife?” 

“You will have to ask them 
that yourself.” 

“You mean you do not know 
what they believe?” 

“I mean that I will not betray 
them.” 

“But you betrayed them the 
moment you led them to the 
Siikii Monument to defile the 
Heroes with your illicit love- 
making and your blasphemous 
prayers,” said Arigi. “You be- 
trayed them the moment you 
first confided to them your 
doubts and encouraged them to 
express theirs. You betrayed 
them when you bought an un- 
lawful contraceptive from crimi- 
nals and fed it to your comrades 
before the orgy.” 

Jagu stiffened. If no one had 
talked, how did Arigi know all 
this? 

Arigi smiled again, and he 
said, “You betrayed them more 
than you know. For instance, the 
weefee pill you gave them to- 
night had no potency at all. I 
had already ordered your source 
of supply to give you a pill that 
looked like and tasted like 
weefee. But it had no effect. A 
fourth of your friends must be 
pregnant right now. Maybe you, 
too.” 

Jagu was shaken, but he tried 
to hide the effect of Arigi’s 
words. He said, “If you’ve known 



THE BLASPHEMERS 



181 



about us for a long time, why 
didn’t you arrest us before?” 
Arigi leaned his upper torso 
back and placed his fingers be- 
hind his head. He looked at a 
point above Jagu, as if his 
thoughts were there. He said 
slowly, and it seemed irrelevant- 
ly, “So far, we joruma have dis- 
covered exactly fifty-one planets 
which can support our type of 
life. Fifty-one out of an esti- 
mated 300,000 in this galaxy 
alone. Of the ones discovered — 
all found in the last twenty-five 
years — twelve were inhabited 
by a centauroid type of sentient, 
similar to us, five by a bipedal 
type, six by very weird sentients 
indeed. All of these intelligent 
beings are bisexual or, I should 
say, have a sexual bipolarity. 

“None of them have our quad- 
rupolar sexual makeup. If we ex- 
trapolate on what we have so 
far found, we could say that the 
centauroid type of body is that 
most favored by Tuu or, if you 
prefer, the old pagan Four Par- 
ents of Nature. The bipedal form 
is second. And Tuu alone knows 
what other exotic beings are 
scattered throughout the Cos- 
mos. 

“We could also speculate that 
Tuu, for some reason, has favor- 
ed us with a monopoly on the 
quadrupolar method of repro- 
duction. At least, we joruma are 
the only ones encountered so 



far with that method. Now, what 
does that suggest to you?” 

V 

J agu was puzzled. This in- 
quisition was not going on 
the lines he had anticipated. He 
was not getting a thundering de- 
nunciation, a blistering lecture, 
threats of physical and mental 
punishment, of death. 

What was Arigi leading up 
to? Perhaps this line of con- 
versation was intended to make 
him think that he was going to 
escape. Then Arigi would attack 
savagely when his defenses were 
lowered. 

“The Book of Mako says that 
a joma is unique in this universe. 
That the joruma are fashioned 
in the shape of Tuu. No other 
creature in all the world — so 
said Mako — is favored of Tuu. 
We are chosen by him to con- 
quer the Cosmos.” 

“So said Mako,” replied Arigi. 
“Or whoever wrote the book 
which is supposed to be written 
by Mako. But I want to know 
what you think.” 

Now Jagu thought he knew 
what Arigi was trying to do to 
him. He was talking thus, lead- 
ing him, so he could get him to 
admit his disbelief. Then Arigi 
would spring. 

But why should Arigi bother? 
He had all the evidence. 



182 



GALAXY 



“What do I think?” said Jagu. 
“I think it rather strange that 
Tuu should have made so many 
differing sentient beings — that 
is, those intelligent enough to 
have language and to have a 
word for God in their languages 
— but only make one in Tuu’s 
image. If he wanted all the 
planets to be eventually popu- 
lated by the joruma, why did he 
create other beings on these 
planets? All of whom, by the 
way, think they have been form- 
ed in their Maker’s image.” 

The two pairs of Arigi’s eye- 
lids had moved inwards so that 
only a sliver of pale green show- 
ed between them. He said, “You 
know that what you have said 
is enough to condemn you? That 
if I submit the evidence to the 
judges, you could be slowly 
burned alive? It’s true that most 
blasphemers are killed quickly 
by being thrown into an intense 
furnace. But the law still stands. 
I would be within legal rights 
if I had you toasted so slowly 
that it would take you twelve 
hours or more to die.” 

“I know,” said Jagu. “I had 
my fun with my friends; I spat 
at the ghosts. Now I have to 
pay.” 

Again Arigi seemed to start 
talking without relevance to the 
issue. 

“Before Mako died, he said 
that his ghost would go forth 



through the cosmos, and he 
would place on other worlds a 
sign that the world was to be 
the possession of the joruma. 
Now, this took place 2500 years 
before space travel. Such a thing 
was not even dreamed of in his 
time. 

“Yet when we reached the 
first inhabitable world, we 
found the sign he promised to 
leave behind him: The stone 
statue of Joma, our ancestor. It 
was carved by Mako to show 
that he had been there and had 
staked out this world for the 
faithful, for the joruma; and five 
others of the fifty-five so far 
found have thereon a giant stone 
statue of Joma. 

“Tell me, how do you account 
for that?” 

J agu said, slowly, “Either 
Mako’s ghost carved the 
image of Joma out of the native 
stone, or. .” 

He paused. 

“Or what?” 

Jagu opened his mouth, but 
the words came hard. He swal- 
lowed and forced them out. 

“Or our spacemen carved those 
statues themselves,” he said. 

Arigi’s reaction was not what 
Jagu had expected. Arigi laugh- 
ed loudly until his face was red. 
Finally, wheezing, wiping his 
eyes with a handkerchief, he 
said, “So! You guessed it! I won- 



THE BLASPHEMERS 



183 



der how many others have? And 
like you are keeping silent be- 
cause of fear?” 

He blew his nose and then 
continued, “Not many, I sup- 
pose. There are not too many 
bom sceptics such as yourself. 
Or many as intelligent.” 

He looked curiously at Jagu. 
“You aren’t happy to find your- 
self right? What’s the matter?” 
“I don’t know. Maybe, though 
I disbelieved, I’d always hoped 
that my faith could be re-estab- 
lished. How much easier for me 
if it could be! If our spaceships 
had found the statues of Mako 
waiting for them, I’d have no 
choice but to believe. .” 

“No, you wouldn’t,” said 
Arigi sharply. 

Jagu stared. “I wouldn’t?” 
“No! If all the evidence point- 
ed toward the reality of Mako 
as a ghost, if the evidence were 
overwhelming, you still would 
not have believed. You would 
have found some rationalization 
for your disbelief. You would 
have said that the correct ex- 
planation or interpretation just 
wasn’t available. And you would 
have continued to reject the idea 
of the ghost.” 

“Why?” said Jagu. “I’m a rea- 
sonable person; I’m rational. I 
think scientifically.” 

“Oh, sure,” said Arigi. “But 
you were born an agnostic, a 
sceptic. You had the tempera- 



ment of the disbeliever in the 
womb. Only by a violent perver- 
sion of your innate character 
could you have accepted reli- 
gion. Most people are bom be- 
lievers; some are not. It’s that 
simple.” 

“You mean,” said Jagu, “that 
reality doesn’t have a thing to do 
with it? That I think as I do, not 
because I have reasoned my way 
through the dark labyrinth of 
religion, but because my tem- 
perament made me think so?” 

“That’s an accurate state- 
ment.” 

“But — but — ” said Jagu, 

“what you’re saying is that there 
is no Truth! That the most 
ignorant peasant and fervent be- 
liever of ghosts has as much 
basis to his claims as I have to 
mine.” 

“Truth? There are truths and 
truths. You fall off a high cliff, 
and you accelerate at such and 
such a velocity until you hit the 
ground. Water, if not dammed, 
flows, downward. These are 
truths no one argues about. Tem- 
perament does not matter in 
physical matters. But in the 
realm of metaphysics, truth is 
an affair of natal prejudice. 
That is all.” 

J agu had not been shaken by 
the thought of the fire and 
he death that waited for him. 
Now he was trembling, and out- 



184 



GALAXY 



raged. Later he would be de- 
pressed. Arigi’s cynicism made 
his look like a child’s. 

Arigi said, “The enlightened 
members — pardon me — the bom 
sceptics of the aristoi have 
not believed in the existence of 
ghosts for some time. In a land 
crowded with the granite images 
of their illustrious ancestors, 
and crowded with worshippers 
of these sculptured stones, we 
laugh. But silently. Or only 
among ourselves. Many of us 
even doubt the existence of God. 

“But we aren’t fools. We sup- 
press any show of public scep- 
ticism. After all, the fabric of 
our society is woven from the 
threads of our religion. It’s an 
excellent means for keeping the 
people in line or for justifying 
our rule over them. 

“Now, haven’t you detected a 
certain pattern in the finding of 
the statues of Mako on the in- 
terstellar planes? In the parti- 
cular type of planet on which the 
statues are?” 

Jagu spoke slowly to control 
the shakiness of his voice. 

“The images are not found on 
those planets populated by sen- 
tients technologically equal to 
us. Only on those planets with 
no sentients or with sentients 
having an inferior technology.” 

“Very good!” said Arigi. “You 
can see that that is no coinci- 
dence. We aren’t about to wage 



war on beings who are able to 
retaliate effectively. Not yet, 
anyway. Now, I’ll tell you why 
I revealed this to you — rather, 
confirmed your suspicions. Ever 
since we have had a faster-than- 
light drive, our interstellar ex- 
ploratory ships have been man- 
ned with crews of a certain 
type. All are aristocrats, and all 
are disbelievers. They have had 
no compunction about chiseling 
statues out of the native rock on 
the appropriate planets.” 

“Why do they have to do 
this?” said Jagu. 

“To establish a principle. To 
justify us. Some day, another 
sentient of equal, maybe supe- 
rior, technological development 
will try to claim one of our 
planets for its own. When that 
day comes, we want our warriors 
and the people at home to be 
fired with a religious frenzy. 

“You want me and my com- 
rades to do this work for you?” 

“For yourselves, too,” said 
Arigi. “You young ones will 
have to take the reins of govern- 
ment after we’re dead. And 
there’s another factor. We’re re- 
cruiting you because we need 
replacements. This is dangerous 
work. Every now and then, a 
ship is lost. Just lost. Leaves port 
and is never heard of again. We 
need new interstellar spacers. 
We need you and your friends 
now. What do you say?” 



THE BLASPHEMERS 



185 



“Is there a choice?” asked 
Jagu. “If we turn down your of- 
fer, what happens to us?” 

“An accident,” said Arigi. 
“We can’t have a trial and ex- 
ecution. Not even in secret. Too 
much chance of dishonoring 
ancient and honorable clans. 

“Very well. I accept. I can’t 
speak for my friends, but I’ll 
speak to them.” 

“I’m sure they’ll see the light,” 
said Arigi dryly. 

VI 

\ few days later, Jagu flew to 
the school for advanced 
space-navy officers. 

He and his friends began to 
take numerous training trips on 
ships that operated within the 
confines of the solar system. A 
year passed, and then they made 
three trips to nearby planetary 
systems under the tutelage of 
veterans. On the final voyage 
and the combat exercises that 
went with it, the veterans acted 
only as observers. 

There was another ceremony. 
A new interstellar destroyer was 
commissioned and christened 
the Paajaa, an a Jagu was given 
a captain’s redstone to wear on 
the brim of his hat. The rest of 
the group also got various in- 
signias of lesser ranks, for the 
craft was to be manned entirely 
by them. 



Before leaving on the maiden 
voyage of the Paajaa, Jagu was 
summoned for one more inter- 
view with Arigi. By now Jagu 
knew that Arigi held more pow- 
er than the public guessed. He 
was not only head of the plane- 
tary police system, he also was 
responsible for all military se- 
curity systems. 

Arigi welcomed Jagu as a 
member of the inner circle. He 
asked him to sit down and gave 
him a glass of kusuto. It was vin- 
tage of the best, thirty years old. 

“You have added honor and 
luster to our clan,” said Arigi. 
“The Wazaga can be proud of 
you. You were not given the 
captainship merely because you 
are a Wazaga, you know. A stel- 
lar ship is too expensive and 
important to be entrusted to a 
youth whose main ability is af- 
filiation with a ruling group. 
You are a captain because you 
deserve the rank.” 

He sniffed at the bouquet of 
the wine and took a small sip. 

Then he put the glass down, 
squinted at Jagu and said, “In 
a few days you will receive of- 
ficial orders to make your first 
exploratory voyage. Your ship 
will have enough fuel and sup- 
plies for a four-year trip, but 
you will be ordered to return 
at the end of two and a half, 
circumstances permitting. Dur- 
ing that one and a quarter year, 



186 



GALAXY 



you will try to locate inhabit- 
able planets. If any planet has 
sentients with a technology with 
space travel restricted to its sys- 
tem and atomic power, you will 
note its present development 
and its potential resistance to 
future attack by us. If the sen- 
tients have interstellar travel, 
you will observe as much as pos- 
sible but will not place your 
ship in danger of attack. And 
you will return, after making 
the observations, directly and at 
full speed to us. 

I f the sentients have an in- 
ferior technology, you will 
locate a site easily observable 
from orbit and will erect or 
carve an image of Mako there. 

“Now! By the time you will 
have returned, many more eggs 
will have been hatched here. 
There will be a larger propor- 
tion of natal disbelievers among 
them than in the few years pre- 
viously. By the time you are my 
age, the number of disbelievers 
will be a great problem. There 
will be strife, changing mores, 
doubt, perhaps even bloodshed. 
Before this occurs, before the 
change of Zeitgeist is on the side 
of the disbelievers and the faith 
in the Heroes and in Mako de- 
clines, we will have settled col- 
onies on various planets unin- 
habited by sentients. We will 
also have wiped out or reduced 



greatly in number those sen- 
tients inferior to us. We will 
have started populating these 
with our kind. Because of our 
method of reproduction, we can 
populate a planet faster than 
any other sentient. And that is 
well, since we will need these 
colonies to aid us in the wars 
that will come. 

“It is inevitable that we will 
have to fight cultures equal or 
perhaps even superior to ours. 
When that comes, we will have 
established the pattern — that 
we have a spiritual right to take 
anything we want. By then the 
weakened belief in the religion 
of our fathers will not affect our 
fighting zeal. We will be replac- 
ing it with another belief. Our 
right to conquest. 

“Meanwhile, of course, I will 
be doing my best to suppress any 
resistance to our official reli- 
gion. Those infidels among the 
aristoi will be indoctrinated in 
in the proper attitude: a con- 
scious hypocrisy. Those who 
nobly refuse will be dealt with 
in one way or another. The 
disbelievers among the lower 
classes will also be eliminated. 
They will be branded as crimi- 
nals. 

“But, of course, they can only 
fight the Zeitgeist so long. Then 
it takes over. By that time, I 
will have joined my ancestors, 
and my work will be done.” 



THE BLASPHEMERS

He smiled wryly and said, “I 
will be a ghost, perhaps, with 
a statue erected to me. However, 
by then my descendants — except 
for the inevitable ultrareaction- 
aries — will regard my shrine as 
a historical or anthropological 
curiosity. I will have to go hun- 
gry among the other hungry 
ghosts — unhonored, unfed, wail- 
ing with weakness and impotent 
anger.” 

Jagu wondered if Arigi did 
not more than half-mean those 
words. He also wondered if Arigi 
was not as self-deceiving as those 
he laughed at. He was making 
his own, personal mythology to 
replace the old. 

After all, what evidence did 
he really have to support his 
thesis that believers were born, 
not made? 

\ week later, he was on the 
Paajaa and had given the or- 
der to take it off. Another week, 
and his natal star was only one 
among many, a tiny glow. He 
was headed for the faroff and 
the unknown. 

A year later, thirty stars later, 
they found two inhabitable plan- 
ets. The second, like the first, 
rotated around a star of the 
Ao-U type. Unlike the first, it 
was the third planet from the 
star and it had sentients. 

The Paajaa went into orbit in 
the upper atmosphere, and the 



telescopes were turned on the 
surface. The powers of magnifi- 
cation of the telescopes were so 
great that the spacers could see 
as distinctly as if they had been 
poised only twenty feet above 
the ground. 

The sentients were bipedal 
and comparatively hairless ex- 
cept for thick growths on their 
heads or, among the males, on 
the faces. The majority covered 
their bodies with a variety of 
garments. Like the joruma, their 
skin colors and hair types varied ; 
the darker ones were mainly in 
the equatorial zone. 

Thousands of photographs 
were made during the orbitings 
of the Paajaa. Those taken of 
the groups that wore little or 
no clothing made it evident that 
these bipedals had only two 
sexes. 

Another fact was determined. 
These sentients had no technol- 
ogy to be compared to the 
joruma’s. They did not even 
have aircraft, except for a few 
balloons. Their main propulsive 
power was the steam engine. 
Steam drove engines of iron on 
iron tracks and paddlewheels or 
screws on ships. There were 
many sailships, also. The most 
formidable weapons were can- 
nons and simple breech-loading 
rifles. 

The aborigines were roughly 
at about the same stage the 



188 



GALAXY 



joruma had been about a cen- 
tury and a half ago. 

VII 

/^vn their three hundredth or- 
bit, Alaku made a shattering 
discovery. 

He was looking at the scene 
projected on a large screen by 
a telescope when he cried out 
loudly. Those nearby came run- 
ning, and they stopped when 
they saw what he was staring at. 
They too cried out. 

By the time Jagu arrived, the 
scene was out of the telescope’s 
reach. But he listended to their 
descriptions, and he ordered that 
the photos made be brought 
to him at once. 

He looked at the photos, and 
he said, keeping his face immo- 
bile so that the others could not 
understand how shocked he was, 
“We’ll have to go down and see 
for ourselves.” 

Four of them went down on 
the launch while the ship, in 
stationary orbit, stayed over- 
head. Their destination was on 
a rocky plateau about five miles 
southeast of the nearest city. The 
city was on the west bank of a 
great river that created a ribbon 
of greenery in the middle of die 
desert that covered much of the 
northern half of the continent. 
It was night, but a full moon 
shone in a cloudless sky. It il- 



luminated brightly the three huge 
pyramids of stone and the object 
that had upset the crew of the 
Paajaa so much. 

This lay in the center of a 
large quarry. 

Ofter hiding their ship in a 
deep and narrow ravine, the 
four proceeded in a small half- 
track. A minute later, Jagu halt- 
ed it, and all got out to look. 

There was silence for a while. 
Then Jagu, speaking slowly as if 
hesitant to commit himself, said, 
“It seems to be Joma.” 

“It’s ancient,” said Alaku. 
“Very ancient. If Mako made 
this, he must have done so im- 
mediately after dying. He must 
have come straight here.” 

“Don’t jump to conclusions,” 
said Jagu. “I was going to say 
that another ship had gotten 
here before us. But we know no 
ship has been sent to this sector. 
However. .” 

“However what?” said Alaku. 

“As you said, it’s ancient. 
Look at the ripples in the stone. 
They must have been made by 
erosion from blowing sand. Look 
at the face. It’s shattered. Still, 
the natives of long ago could 
have made this. It’s very pos- 
sible.” 

Silent again, they re-entered 
the halftrack and began to drive 
slowly around the enormous sta- 
tue. 

“It faces the east,” said Alaku. 

189 



THE BLASPHEMERS 



“Just as Mako said the statues 
of Joma would.” 

“Many primitive sentients on 
many worlds face their gods, 
their temples and their dead to- 
wards the east,” said Jagu. “It’s 
natural to regard the rising sun 
as the recurrent symbol of im- 
mortality.” 

Fawani said, “This may be 
the biggest reproduction of 
Joma. But it’s not the only one 
on this world. The photos show- 
ed others. They too must be an- 
cient. Perhaps it’s only coinci- 
dence. The natives themselves 
made them. They’re figures, 
symbols of their religion.” 

“Or,” said Alaku, “the natives 
founded a religion that was 
based on Joma after Mako came 
here and carved this statue out 
of the rock. He may even have 
given them our religion. So, as 
you saw, they set up a temple 
before Joma. I’m sure that’s what 
the ruins in front of the breasts 
were. They made other smaller 
images of Joma. Then ages later 
they ceased to believe in Joma 
. just as we are ceasing to be- 
lieve. Yet the testimony to the 
truth was before their mocking 
eyes. .” 

Jagu knew they could not de- 
termine the truth no matter how 
long they speculated among 
themselves. The thing to do was 
to locate somebody who did 
know. 



T T e turned the halftrack to- 

-*■ wards the city. 

There were isolated houses on 
its outskirts. Before he had gone 
a mile, he found what he was 
looking for. A party of natives 
were headed towards him. All 
were riding beasts tjjat looked 
very much like the gapo of the 
deserts of his own planet, except 
that these had only four legs and 
one hump. 

The gapoids scattered in a 
panic; some threw their riders. 
The joruma shot these with gas- 
driven darts, the tips of which 
were coated with a paralyzing 
drug. After tearing the robes 
from his victims to make sure 
he had a specimen of each sex 
(for he knew that the zoologists 
at home would want to examine 
them) *he joruma chose a male 
and a female. These were loaded 
into the halftrack, which then 
returned to the launch. In a few 
minutes, the launch was rising 
towards the Paajaa. 

Back on the ship, the sleepers 
were placed on beds within a 
locked room. Jagu inspected 
them and, for the thousandth 
time, wondered if the joruma 
were not designed by Tuu to be 
superior. Perhaps they were 
really made in Tuu’s image. 
These bipedals seemed to be so 
scrawny and weak and so in- 
efficient, sexually speaking. One 
sex could never hatch an egg or 



190 



GALAXY 



bear young. This fault halved 
the species’ chances of reproduc- 
ing. Moreover, he thought, pre- 
serving humor even in his semi- 
stunned condition, it cut out 
three-quarters of the fun. 

Maybe the other sentients 
were, as some theologians had 
theorized, experiments on Tuu’s 
part. Or maybe Tuu had meant 
for non-joruma to be inferior. 

Let the theologians speculate. 
He had a far more important 
and immediate enigma to solve. 
Also he had Alaku to worry 
about. 

Alaku, the cool one, he whose 
only permanent passion was in- 
tellectualism, the agnostic, was 
by far the most shaken. 

Jagu remembered Arigi’s 
words. You believe what you 
want to believe. The metaphysi- 
cal cannot be denied or affirm- 
ed in terms of the physical. 

“It’s a judgment,” said Alaku. 
“We thought we were so clever 
and our fathers so ignorant and 
superstitious. But Mako knew 
that some day we would come 
here and find the truth. He 
knew it before our great-great- 
great-great-grandfathers were 
bom.” 

“We have two natives,” said 
Jagu. “We’ll learn their lan- 
guage. From them we may dis- 
cover who did carve out Joma 
— I mean that statue that seems 
to resemble Joma.” 



“How will they know?” said 
Alaku, looking desperate. “They 
will have only the words of their 
ancestors as testimony, just as 
we have the words of ours.” 
This was the last time Jagu 
talked to Alaku. 

Shortly thereafter, Alaku fail- 
ed to appear for his turn of duty 
on the bridge. Jagu called him 
over the intercom. Receiving no 
answer, he went to Alaku’s 
cabin. The door was locked, but 
it 'yielded to the master key. 
Alaku lay on the floor, his skin 
blue from cyanide. 

He left no note behind. None 
was needed. 

'T'he entire crew was saddened 
and depressed. Alaku, despite 
a certain aloofness, had been 
loved. The many eggs he had fa- 
thered in them, and the eggs

they had fathered in him, were 
in the cryogenic tank, waiting 
to be quick- thawed when they 
returned to their home. 

A few hours later, the two na- 
tives killed each other. The 
bigger one strangled the other. 
But before that the veins of the 
strangler’s wrists had been bitten 
into and opened by the other. 
After the smaller had died, the 
other had exercised violently to 
stimulate the bleeding. 

Almost, Jagu decided to turn 
around and capture some more 
sentients from the same area. 
But he could not force himself 
to do that. To return and see 
Joma again, the awe-inspiring 
ancient being of stone . who 
knew but what more might go 
mad? He could be among them. 

For several ship-days, he paced 
back and forth on the bridge. Or 
he lay in his bed in his cabin, 
staring at the bulkhead. 

Finally, one third-watch, Jagu 
went onto the bridge. Fawani, 
the closest of all to him, was also 
on the bridge, carrying out his 
slight duties as pilot. He did not 
seem surprised to see Jagu; Jagu 
often came here when he was 
supposed to be sleeping. 

“It has been a long time since 
we were together,” said Fawani. 
“The statue on that Tuu-for- 
saken planet and Alaku’s suicide 
. they have killed love. They 
have killed everything except 



wonder about one question.” 

“I don’t wonder. I know that 
it was made by the natives. I 
know because that’s the only 
way it could be.” 

“But there’s no way of prov- 
ing it, is there?” said Fawani. 

“No,” replied Jagu. “So before 
we get back home, long before, 
we must make up our minds to 
act.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“We have several avenues of 
action. One, report exactly what 
we have seen. Let the authorities 
do the thinking for us, let them 
decide what to do. Two, forget 
about having discovered the sec- 
ond planet. Report only the first 
planet. Three, don’t go home. 
Find a planet suitable for col- 
onization, one so far away it 
may not be found by other 
joruma ships for hundreds of 
years, maybe longer. 

\ 11 three are dangerous,” 
continued Jagu. “You don’t 
know Arigi as I do. He will re- 
fuse to believe in the coinci- 
dence because the mathematical 
chances against it are too high. 
He will also refuse to believe 
that Mako did it. He will con- 
clude that we made those statues 
to perpetrate a monstrous hoax.” 
“But how could he believe 
such a thing?” 

“I couldn’t blame him,” said 
Jagu, “because he knows our 



192 



GALAXY 



past record. He might think that 
we did it just to raise hell. Or 
even that the long voyage un- 
balanced us, that we became con- 
verted, backslid to superstition, 
committed a pious fraud to con- 
vince him and others like him. 
It doesn’t matter. Hell think we 
did it He has to think that or 
admit his whole philosophy of 
life is wrong. 

“If we try to get rid of all 
evidence, the photos, the log- 
book, we run a risk of someone 
talking. I think it’d be a cer- 
tainty. We belong to the species 
that can’t keep its mouth shut 
Or somebody else may go mad 
and babble the truth. 

“Personally I think that we 
should try the third alternative. 
Go far out into an unknown sec- 
tor, so far that we can’t return. 
This will put us beyond the 
range of any ships now built. If, 
in the future, one should find 
us, we can always say we had 
an accident, that the ship couldn’t 
return.” 

“But what if we reach the end 
of our fuel, and we still have 
found no suitable planet?” said 
Fawani. 

“It’s a long chance, but the 
best we have,” said Jagu. 

He pointed at the lower left- 
hand comer of a starmap on a 
bulkhead. “There are quite a 
few Ao-U stars there,” he said. 
“If I gave the order to you now. 



at this moment, to head the ship 
toward them — would you obey 
my order?” 

“I don’t know what to think,” 
said Fawani. “I do know that 
we could spend the rest of our 
long voyage home arguing about 
the best course of action. And 
still be undecided by the time we 
let down on earth. I trust you, 
Jagu, because I believe in you.” 

“Believe?” said Jagu. He smil- 
ed. “Are there also bom believer* 
in others? And those men bom 
to be believed in? Perhaps. But 
what about the rest of the crew? 
Will they as unhesitatingly fol- 
low me?” 

“Talk to them,” said Fawani. 
“Tell them what you told me. 
They will do as I did. I won’t 
even wait for the outcome. I’ll 
turn the ship now. They won’t 
need to know that until after 
they’ve decided to do so — pro- 
vided you talk to them before 
I’m relieved.” 

“Very well. Turn it around. 
Head it in that general direction. 
We’ll pick out a particular star 
later. Well find one or die try- 
ing. We’ll begin life anew. And 
we don’t teach our children any- 
thing about the ghosts of long- 
dead heroes.” 

“Turn about it is,” said Fa- 
wani. He busied himself with 
the controls and with inserting 
various cards in the computer. 



THE BLASPHEMERS 



193 



thing about the ghosts of heroes.” 
Then, he said, “But can man 
exist in a religious vacuum? 
What will we tell them to re- 
place the old beliefs?” 

“They’ll believe what they 
want to believe,” said Jagu wear- 
ily. “Anyway, we’ve a long time 
to think about that.” 

T Te was silent while he looked 
-*■ out at the stars. He thought 
about the planet they had just 
left. The sentients there would 
never know what gratitude they 
owed to him, Jagu. 

If he had returned to base and 
told his story, the Navy — no 
matter what happened to Jagu 
and his crew — would go to that 
planet. And they would proceed 
to capture specimens and would 
determine their reaction to a 
number of laboratory-created 
diseases. Within a few years only 
the naturally resistant of the na- 
tives would be left alive. Their 
planet would be open to coloni- 
zation by the joruma. 



Now the bipedals had a period 
of grace. If they developed space 
travel and atomic power soon 
enough, the next joruma ship 
would declare them off-limits. 

Who knew? His own descend- 
ants might regret this decision. 
Some day, the sons of those sen- 
tients who had been spared by 
his action might come to the 
very planet on which his, Jagu’s, 
sons would be living. They might 
even attack and destroy or en- 
slave the joruma. 

That was another chance he 
and his descendants would have 
to take. 

He pressed the button that 
would awaken the sleepers and 
summon those on watch. Now he 
must begin talking. 

He knew that they all would 
be troubled until the day they 
died. Yet, he swore to himself, 
their sons would not know of it. 
They would be free of the past 
and its doubts and its fears. 

They would be free.

FORECAST 

Poul Anderson, who seemingly never learned how to write a bad 
story, gives us a particularly good one next issue. There's all that lunar 
real estate hanging up there in the sky, you see — but no air, no water, 
ergo no life. We talk glibly of terraforming it to make lebensraum for 
Earth's expanding population. But is it going to be as easy as that? 

In next issue's complete short novel. To Build a World, Anderson 
gives us the answer to the three big questions of terraforming: How? How 
much? And — most of all — Over whose dead body? 

It's a good one!

12 famous authors start a 
new kind of writing school 

If you have writing talent worth developing, 
here’s an opportunity never before available: 

Twelve of America’s most famous authors 
have created a school of professional writing 
to help you develop your skill, talent and 
craftsmanship . and to pass on to you their 
secrets of achieving success and recognition. 

This unique home-training program is su- 
pervised by Rod Serling, winner of five Em- 
mys for TV writing; Pulitzer Prize historian 
Bruce Catton; best-selling novelist Faith 
Baldwin; humorist Max (Dobie Gillis) Shul- 
man; publisher-columnist Bennett Cerf; 
famed sportswriter Red Smith; Rudolf Flesch, 
top authority on readable writing; noted lan- 
guage expert Prof. Bergen Evans; famous 
mystery novelist Mignon G. Eberhart; J. D. 

Ratcliff, called by Time “America’s No. 1 
craftsman in the field of non-fiction’’; and 
top’ad men John Caples and Mark Wiseman. 

These famous authors have developed q 
remarkable series of textbooks, lessons and 
writing assignments that present — in a clear 
and stimulating way — what they have learned 
in their long, hard climb to the top. 

The School’s instructors are themselves 
professional writers. Under the supervision 
of the 12 Famous Writers, these instructors 
work with students by mail, just as magazine 
and book editors work with many established 
authors. And they spend up to several hours 



on each assignment completed by a student 
. revising, correcting, and advising. 

The Famous Writers School is less than 
three years old. Its first students are not due 
to graduate until later this year. Yet, many 
have sold their writings to such varied publi- 
cations as The Readers Digest, Redbook, 
Popular Science, True Story. 

To select people with writing talent worth 
developing, the 12 Famous Writers have de- 
signed a revealing Talent Test. The coupon 
will bring you a copy, along with a brochure 
about the School. Your completed Test will 4 
be graded without charge or obligation by 
one of the School’s instructors. If your Test 
indicates writing talent, you are then eligible 
to enroll in the School. You are, however, un- 
der absolutely no obligation to do so. 



Famous Writers School
