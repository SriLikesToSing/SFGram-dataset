TWO UPPER UPS 



1VTOW THAT polio seems to be 
-L ’ conquered for good, the next 
goal of coordinated research ob- 
viously should be mental illness, 
for psychiatric beds outnumber 
all others combined. I’m for it, of 
course, but my fear is that the 
attack is likely to be almost ex- 
clusively physiological. 

Certainly this is needed in 
cases of organic damage or mal- 
function. But these account for 
only a small part of the trouble. 
By far the greater number are 
emotionally maimed . the re- 
sult of a disastrous paradoxical 
heritage from both the frontier 
and aristocracy. 

The primitive contribution 
might be summarized as: “Too 
late to pull arrow from White 
Horse’s chest. Leave White 
Horse to walk alone to Happy 
Hunting Grounds. .” 

And from Old World aris- 
tocracy: “Go on without me, 

chaps; afraid I’m done for. Bad 
show and all that. .” 

With two stiff upper lips — 
one very red and the other purest 
white — we have only the legacy 
and none of the conditioning that 
made such heroism not only 
possible but safe! 

We generally regard Indians 
as stoics from birth. But the 
remarkable fact is that they prac- 



ticed — fully, without any ifs 
and buts — what we like to think 
of as progressive education. They 
eliminated childhood frustrations 
by giving their youngsters any- 
thing they cried for. 

Far from spoiling them, this 
gave the kids a wholly unshak- 
able sense of worth that allowed 
them to become complete adults. 
For only an unhappy, thwarted, 
unresolved childhood has to be 
clung to. 

Aristocratic upbringing was un- 
swervingly strict, but it had the 
advantage of a deep conviction 
of worth by birth. But even this 
is fairly recent; a man’s nobility 
used to be measured by the vio- 
lence of his emotions. 

Take away the means to the 
stiff upper lip and the payoff is 
packed hospitals. Yet we can’t 
carry progressive upbringing as 
far as the Indians did and have 
a technological society. And aris- 
tocracy isn’t possible for every- 
body — it requires hereditary 
lower classes to feel superior to. 

So these are not the answers; 
we must look elsewhere. An im- 
portant lead is that women, 
generally allowed to be more 
emotional, have only half as 
much mental illness as men — 
and that those who do have been 
victimized in the same way as 



4 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



men: “Sissy!” and “Cry Baby!” 
and “Big girls don’t cry.” 

In other words, the problem 
of mental illness is literally a 
crying need. 

But a technological society 
demands discipline and would, 
without it, disintegrate through 
confusion and accidents and dis- 
obedience. 

The solution, then, must be in 
the home. If we can’t have the 
conditioning, let’s do away with 
the stiff upper lip. And the place 
to do it is in the Tantrum Room, 
which my family and I designed 
one very stormy Sunday morn- 
ing — after tempers had cooled 
off. 

Set apart from the rest of the 
house, the Tantrum Room should 
have a baseboard for kicking 
(foam rubber, no sharp edges), 
a dummy punching bag (with 
recess for photograph) and 
breakaway furniture, cheap ash- 
trays and crockery for smashing 
or throwing. 

A microphone and loudspeaker 
for yelling, with meter to show 
how many decibels one achieves; 
this should be a source of pride 
— restrained yelling is only a bit 
better than none. 

A floor that one can really 
stamp around on. 

A chair (facing corner) for 
sulking. 

A gym mat for kicking heels. 

Pictures of family, friends, rela- 



tives, bosses, with rubber balls 
and darts to hurl at them. 

Crying towel for each member 
of the family, in favorite personal 
color. 

Hand-grips for clenching, plus 
one (shaped like neck) for vi- 
carious throttling. 

Sledges and targets, from peg 
set for toddlers to carnival bell- 
ringer for adults. 

Rural areas have equivalents 
of all these items as everyday 
farm and household equipment. 
This may be why mental health 
is better there than in cities; 
ruralites can work off their feel- 
ings and urbanites can’t withoift 
causing a row or a neighborhood 
scandal. 

My son Eugene came up with 
the most significant idea of all 
— since a Tantrum Room should 
be soundproofed, he suggested a 
tape recorder “So nothing will 
get wasted.” 

He’s right. A tantrum is a 
form of communication — what’s 
the good of throwing one if it 
isn’t heard, sympathized with and 
understood? 

Where individual Tantrum 
Rooms aren’t possible, apartment 
buildings and communities ought 
to supply them. 

A slogan is needed for the 
program. I offer: “Yell and Keep 
Well!” or “Let’s Stamp Out Stiff 
Upper Lips NOW!”

and wet a sneeze to be ignored. 
You didn’t sneeze like that in a 
dream — if you sneezed at all. 
He gave up. He’d have to open 
his eyes and take another look. 
At the thought, his neck muscles 
went rigid with spasm. 

A little while ago, he’d fallen 
asleep while reading an article 
he’d written for a scholarly jour- 
nal. He’d fallen asleep in his own 
bed in his own apartment in Cal- 
lahan Hall — “a charming and 
inexpensive residence for those 
members of the faculty who are 
bachelors and desire to live on 
campus.” He’d awakened with a 
slightly painful tingling sensation 
in every inch of his body. He felt 
as if he were being stretched, 
stretched interminably and — 
and loosened. Then, abruptly, he 
had floated off the bed and gone 
through the open window like a 
rapidly attentuating curl of 
smoke. He’d gone straight up to 
the star-drenched sky of night, 
dwindling in substance until he 
lost consciousness completely. 

A ND had come to on this enor- 
mous flat expanse of white 
table-top, with a multi-vaulted 
ceiling above him and dank, bare- 
ly breathable air in his lungs. 
Hanging from the ceiling were 
quantities and quantities of what 
was indubitably electronic equip- 
ment, but the kind of equipment 

B 



the boys in the Physics Depart- 
ment might dream up, if the grant 
they’d just received from the gov- 
ernment for military radiation re- 
search had been a million times 
larger than it was, and if Profes- 
sor Bowles, the department head, 
had insisted that every gadget be 
carefully constructed to look sub- 
stantially different from anything 
done in electronics to date. 

The equipment above him had 
been rattling and gurgling and 
whooshing, glowing and blinking 
and coruscating. Then it had 
stopped as if someone had been 
satisfied and had turned off a 
switch. 

So Clyde Manship had sat up 
to see who had turned it off. 

He had seen all right. 

He hadn’t seen so much who 
as he had seen what. And it 
hadn’t been a nice what. In fact, 
none of the whats he had 
glimpsed in that fast look around 
had been a bit nice. So he had 
shut his eyes fast and tried to 
find another mental way out of 
the situation. 

But now he had to have an- 
other look. It might not be so 
bad the second time. “It’s always 
darkest,” he told himself with de- 
termined triteness, “before the 
dawn.” And then found himself 
involuntarily adding, “Except on 
days when there’s an eclipse.” 

But he opened his eyes any- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



way, wincingly, the way a child 
opens its mouth for the second 
spoonful of castor oil. 

Yes, they were all as he had 
remembered them. Pretty awful. 

The table-top was an irregular 
sort of free-form shape, bordered 
by thick, round knobs a few inch- 
es apart. And perched on these 
knobs, about six feet to the right 
of him, were two creatures who 
looked like black leather suit- 
cases. Instead of handles or 
straps, however, they sported a 
profusion of black tentacles, doz- 
ens and dozens of tentacles, every 
second or third one of which end- 
ed in a moist turquoise eye shield- 
ed by a pair of the sweepingest 
eyelashes Manship had ever seen 
outside of a mascara advertise- 
ment. 

Imbedded in the suitcase pro- 
per, as if for additional decora- 
tive effect, were swarms of other 
sky-blue eyes, only these, with- 
out eyelashes, bulged out in mul- 
titudes of tiny, glittering facets 
like enormous gems. There was 
no sign of ear, nose or mouth any- 
where on the bodies, but there 
was a kind of slime, a thick, gray- 
ish slime, that oozed out of the 
black bodies and dripped with a 
steady splash-splash-splash to the 
floor beneath. 

On his left, about fifteen feet 
away, where the table-top extend- 
ed a long peninsula, there was 

THE FLAT-EYED MONSTER 



another one of the creatures. Its 
tentacles gripped a pulsating 
spheroid across the surface of 
which patches of light constantly 
appeared and disappeared. 

A S NEAR as Manship could 
tell, all the visible eyes of the 
three were watching him intently. 
He shivered and tried to pull his 
shoulders closer together. 

“Well, Professor,” someone 
asked suddenly, “what would you 
say?” 

“I’d say this was one hell of a 
way to wake up,” Manship burst 
out, feelingly. He was about to 
go on and develop this theme in 
more colorful detail when two 
things stopped him. 

The first was the problem of 
who had asked the question. He 
had seen no other human — no 
other living creature, in fact — 
besides the three tentacled suit- 
cases anywhere in that tremend- 
ous, moisture-filled room. 

The second thing that stopped 
him was that someone else had 
begun to answer the question at 
the same time, cutting across 
Manship’s words and ignoring 
them completely. 

“Well, obviously,” this person 
said, “the experiment is a success. 
It has completely justified its ex- 
pense and the long years of re- 
search behind it. You can see for 
yourself, Councilor Glomg, that 

9 



one-way teleportation is an ac- 
complished fact.” 

Manship realized that the 
voices were coming from his 
right. The wider of the two suit- 
cases — evidently “the professor” 
to whom the original query had 
been addressed — was speaking 
.o the narrower one who had 
swung most of his stalked eyes 
away from Manship and had fo- 
cused them on his companion. 
Only where in blazes were the 
voices coming from? Somewhere 
inside their bodies? There was 
no sign anywhere of vocal ap- 
paratus. 

AND HOW COME, Manship’s 
mind suddenly shrieked, THEY 
TALK ENGLISH? 

“I can see that,” Councilor 
Glomg admitted with a blunt 
honesty that became him well. 
“It’s an accomplished fact, all 
right, Professor Lirld. Only, what 
precisely has it accomplished?” 

Lirld raised some thirty or 
forty tentacles in what Manship 
realized fascinatedly was an ela- 
borate and impatient shrug. “The 
teleportation of a living organ- 
ism from astronomical unit 649- 
301-3 without the aid of trans- 
mitting apparatus on the planet 
of origin.” 

The Councilor swept his eyes 
back to Manship. “You call that 
living?” he inquired doubtfully. 

“Oh, come now, Councilor,” 

10 



Professor Lirld protested. “Let’s 
not have any flefnomorphism. It 
is obviously sentient, obviously 
motile, after a fashion — ” 

“All right. It’s alive. I’ll grant 
that. But sentient? It doesn’t even 
seem to pmbff from where I 
stand. And those horrible, lonely 
eyes! Just two of them — and so 
llat! That dry, dry skin without a 
trace of slime. I’ll admit that — ” 

“You’re not exactly a thing of 
beauty and a joy forever your- 
self, you know,” Manship, deeply 
offended, couldn’t help throwing 
out indignantly. 

“ — I tend to flefnomorphism 
in my evaluation of alien life- 
forms,” the other went on as if he 
hadn’t spoken. “Well, I’m a flef- 
nobe and proud of it. But after 
all, Professor Lirld, I have seen 
some impossible creatures from 
our neighboring planets that my 
son and other explorers have 
brought back. The very strangest 
of them, the most primitive ones, 
at least can pmhft! But this — 
this thing. Not the smallest, 
slightest trace of a pmb do I see 
on it! It’s eerie, that’s what it is 
— eerie!” 

“Not at all,” Lirld assured him. 
“It’s merely a scientific anomaly. 
Possibly in the outer reaches of 
the Galaxy where animals of this 
sort are frequent, possibly condi- 
tions are such that pmbffing is 
unnecessary. A careful examina- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tion should tell us a good deal 
very quickly. Meanwhile, we’ve 
proved that life exists in other 
areas of the Galaxy than its sun- 
packed core. And when the time 
comes for us to conduct explora- 
tory voyages to these areas, in- 
trepid adventurers like your son 
will go equipped with informa- 
tion. They will know what to 
expect.” 

“Now, listen,” Manship began 
shouting in desperation. “Can you 
or can you not hear me?” 

“You can shut off the power, 
Srin,” Professor Lirld comment- 
ed. “No sense in wasting it. I be- 
lieve we have as much of this 
creature as we need. If any more 
of it is due to materialize, it will 
arrive on the residual beam.” 

T HE flefnobe on Manship’s 
left rapidly spun the strange 
spheroid he was holding. A low 
hum, which had filled the build- 
ing and had been hardly notice- 
able before, now died away. As 
Srin peered intently at the patch- 
es of light on the surface of the 
instrument, Manship suddenly 
guessed that they were meter 
readings. Yes, that’s exactly what 
they were — meter readings. 
Now, how did 1 know that? he 
wondered. 

Obvious. There was only one 
answer. If they couldn’t hear him 
no matter how loudly he shouted, 



if they gave no sign that they 
even knew he was shouting, and 
if, at the same time, they seemed 
to indulge in the rather improb- 
able feat of talking his native lan- 
guage — they were obviously 
telepaths. Without anything that 
looked like ears or mouths. 

He listened carefully as Srin 
asked his superior a question. It 
seemed to sound in his ears as 
words, English words in a clear, 
resonant voice. But there was a 
difference. There was a quality 
missing, the kind of realistic bite' 
that fresh fruit has and artificial 
fruit flavoring doesn’t. And be- 
hind Srin’s words there were low, 
murmuring bubbles of other 
words, unorganized sentence frag- 
ments which would occasionally 
become “audible” enough to clari- 
fy a subject that was not included 
in the “conversation.” That, Man- 
ship realized, was how he had 
learned that the shifting patches 
of light on the spheroid were 
meter readings. 

It was also evident that when- 
ever they mentioned something 
for which no equivalent at all 
existed in English, his mind sup- 
plied him with a nonsense sylla- 
ble. 

So far so good. He’d been 
plucked out of his warm bed in 
Callahan Hall by a telepathic 
suitcase named something like 
Lirld which was equipped with 



THE FLAT-EYED MONSTER 



11 



quantities of eyes and tentacles. 
He’d been sucked down to some 
planet in an entirely different sys- 
tem near the center of the Gal- 
axy, clad in nothing but apple- 
green pajamas. 

He was on a world of telepaths 
who couldn’t hear him at all, but 
upon whom he could eavesdrop 
with ease, his brain evidently be- 
ing a sufficiently sensitive anten- 
na. He was scheduled shortly to 
undergo a “careful examination,” 
a prospect he did not relish, the 
more so as he was evidently 
looked upon as a sort of mon- 
strous laboratory animal. Finally, 
he was not thought much of, 
chiefly because he couldn’t pmbfl 
worth a damn. 

All in all, Clyde Manship de- 
cided, it was about time that he 
made his presence felt. Let them 
know, so to speak, that he was 
definitely not a lower form of 
life, but one of the boys. That he 
belonged to the mind-over-matter 
club himself and came of a long 
line of IQ-fanciers on both sides 
of his family. 

Only how? 

Vague memories of adventure 
stories read as a boy drifted back 
to him. Explorers land on a 
strange island. Natives, armed 
with assorted spears, clubs and 
small boulders, gallop out of the 
jungle to meet them, their 
whoops an indisputable prelude 

12 



to mayhem. Explorers, sweating 
a bit, as they do not know the 
language of this particular island, 
must act quickly. Naturally, they 
resort to — they resort to — the 
universal sign language! S/gn lan- 
guage. Universal! 

S TILL in a sitting position, 
Clyde Manship raised both 
arms straight up over his head. 
“Me friend,” he intoned. “Me 
come in peace.” He didn’t expect 
the dialogue to get across, but it 
seemed to him that voicing such 
words might help him psycho- 
logically and thus add more sin- 
cerity to the gesture. 

“ — and you might as well 
turn off the recording apparatus, 
too,” Professor Lirld was instruct- 
ing his assistant. “From here on 
out, we’ll take everything down 
on a double memory-fix.” 

Srin manipulated his spheroid 
again. “Think I should modulate 
the dampness, sir? The creature’s 
dry skin seems to argue a desert 
climate.” 

“Not at all. I strongly suspect 
it to be one of those primitive 
forms which can survive in a 
variety of environments. The 
specimen seems to be getting 
along admirably. I tell you, Srin, 
we can be very well satisfied with 
the results of the experiment up 
to this point.” 

“Me friend,” Manship went on 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



desperately, raising and lowering 
his arms. “Me intelligent entity. 
Me have I.Q. of 140 on the 
Wechsler-Bellevue scale.” 

“You may be satisfied,” Glomg 
was saying, as Lirld left the table 
with a light jump and floated, 
like an oversized dandelion, to a 
mass of equipment overhead, “but 
I’m not. I don’t like this business 
one little bit.” 

“Me friendly and intelligent 
enti — ” Manship began. He 
sneezed again. “Damn this wet 
air,” he muttered morosely. 

“What was that?” Glomg de- 
manded. 

“Nothing very important, 
Councilor,” Srin assured him. 
“The creature did it before. It is 
evidently a low-order biological 
reaction that takes place period- 
ically, possibly a primitive meth- 
od of imbibing glrnk. Not by any 
stretch of the imagination a 
means of communication, how- 
ever.” 

“I wasn’t thinking of com- 
munication,” Glomg observed tes- 
tily. “I thought it might be a pre- 
lude to aggressive action.” 

The professor skimmed back 
to the table, carrying a skein of 
luminescent wires. “Hardly. What 
could a creature of this sort be 
aggressive with? I’m afraid you’re 
letting your mistrust of the un- 
known run away with you, Coun- 
cilor Glomg.” 

THE FLAT-EYED MONSTER 



Manship had crossed his arms 
across his chest and subsided into 
a helpless silence. There was evi- 
dently no way to make himself 
understood outside of telepathy. 
And how do you start transmit- 
ting telepathically for the first 
time? What do you use? 

If only his doctoral thesis had 
been in biology or physiology, he 
thought wistfully, instead of The 
Use of the Second Aorist in the 
First Three Books of the Iliad. 
Oh, well. He was a long way from 
home. Might as well try. 

TTE CLOSED his eyes, having 
-*-•1 first ascertained that Profes- 
sor Lirld did not intend to ap- 
proach his person with the new 
piece of equipment. He wrinkled 
his forehead and leaned forward 
with an effort of extreme concen- 
tration. 

Testing, he thought as hard as 
he could, testing, testing. One, 
two, three, four — testing, test- 
ing. Can you hear me? 

“I just don’t like it,” Glomg 
announced again. “I don’t like 
what we’re doing here. Call it a 
presentiment, call it what you 
will, but I feel we are tampering 
with the infinite — and we 
shouldn’t.” 

I’m testing, Manship ideated 
frantically. Mary had a little 
lamb. Testing, testing. I’m the 
alien creature and I’m trying to 

13 



communicate with you. Come in, 
please. 

“Now, Councilor,” Lirld pro- 
tested irritably. “Let’s have none 
of that. This is a scientific experi- 
ment.” 

“That’s all very well. But I be- 
lieve there are mysteries that 
flefnobe was never meant to ex- 
amine. Monsters as awful look- 
ing as this — no slime on the 
skin, only two eyes and both of 
them flat, unable or unwilling to 
pmbff, an almost complete ab- 
sence of tentacles — a creature 
of this sort should have been left 
undisturbed on its own hellish 
planet. There are limits to sci- 
ence, my learned friend — or 
there should be. One should not 
seek to know the unknowable!” 
Can’t you hear me? Manship 
begged. Alien entity to Srin, Lirld 
and Glomg: This is an attempt 
at a telepathic connection. Come 
in, please, someone. Anyone. He 
considered for a moment, then 
added: Roger. Over. 

“I don’t recognize such limita- 
tions, Councilor. My curiosity is 
as vast as the Universe.” 

“That may be,” Glomg re- 
joined portentously. “But there 
are more things in Tiz and Tetz- 
bah, Professor Lirld, than are 
dreamed of in your philosophy.” 
“My philosophy — ” Lirld be- 
gan, and broke off to announce 
— “Here’s your son. Why don’t 

14 



you ask him? Without the benefit 
of half a dozen scientific investi- 
gations that people like you have 
wanted to call off time after time, 
none of his heroic achievements 
in interplanetary discovery would 
be possible.” 

Thoroughly defeated, but still 
curious, Manship opened his eyes 
in time to see an extremely nar- 
row black suitcase swarm up to 
the table-top in a spaghetti-clus- 
ter of tentacles. 

“What is — that?” the new- 
comer inquired, curling a bunch 
of supercilious eye-stalks over 
Manship’s head. “It looks like a 
yurd with a bad case of hipple- 
statch.” He considered for a mo- 
ment, then added, “Galloping hip- 
plestatch.” 

“It’s a creature from astro- 
nomical unit 649-301-3 that I’ve 
just succeeded in teleporting to 
our planet,” Lirld told him proud- 
ly. “Mind you, Rabd, without a 
transmitting outfit on the other 
end! I admit I don’t know why 
it worked this time and never 
before — but that’s a matter for 
further research. A beautiful 
specimen, though, Rabd. And, as 
near as we can tell, in perfect 
condition. You can put it away 
now, Srin.” 

“Oh, no you don’t, Srin — ” 
Manship had barely started to 
announce when a great rectangle 
of some pliable material fell from 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the ceiling and covered him. A 
moment later, the table-top on 
which he’d been sitting seemed 
to drop away and the ends of 
the material were gathered in un- 
derneath him and fastened with 
a click by a scuttling individual 
whom he took to be the assistant. 
Then, before he had time to so 
much as wave his arms, the table- 
top shot up with an abruptness 
that he found twice as painful 
as it was disconcerting. 

A ND there he was, packaged as 
thoroughly as a birthday 
present. All in all, things were 
not improving, he decided. Well, 
at least they seemed disposed to 
leave him alone now. And as yet 
they showed no tendency to 
shove him up on a laboratory 
shelf along with dusty jars of 
flefnobe foetuses pickled in alco- 
hol. 

The fact that he was probably 
the first human being in history 
to make contact with an extrater- 
restrial race failed to cheer Clyde 
Manship in the slightest. 

First, he reflected, the contact 
had been on a distinctly minor 
key — the sort that an oddly 
colored moth makes with a col- 
lector’s bottle rather than a mo- 
mentous meeting between the 
proud representatives of two dif- 
ferent civilizations. 

Second, and much more im- 

THE FLAT-EYED MONSTER 



portant, this sort of hands-across- 
the-cosmos affair was more likely 
to enthuse an astronomer, a so- 
ciologist or even a physicist than 
an assistant professor of Com- 
parative Literature. 

He’d had fantastic daydreams 
aplenty in his lifetime. But they 
concerned being present at the 
premiere of Macbeth, for exam- 
ple, and watching a sweating 
Shakespeare implore Burbage 
not to shout out the “Tomorrow 
and Tomorrow and Tomorrow” 
speech in the last act: “For God’s 
sake, Dick, your wife just died 
and you’re"- about to lose your 
kingdom and your life — don’t 
let it sound like Meg at the Mer- 
maid screaming for a dozen of 
ale. Philosophical, Dick, that’s the 
idea, slow, mournful and philo- 
sophical. And just a little be- 
wildered.” 

Or he’d imagined being one of 
the company at that moment 
sometime before 700 B.C. when a 
blind poet rose and intoned for 
the first time: “Anger, extreme 
anger, that is my tale . .” 

Or being a house guest at Yas- 
naya Polyana when Tolstoy wan- 
dered in from the garden with an 
abstracted look on his face and 
muttered: “Just got an idea for 
a terrific yam about the Napo- 
leonic invasion of Russia. And 
what a title! War and Peace. 
Nothing pretentious, nothing 

15 



complicated. Just simply War 
and Peace. It’ll knock them dead 
in St. Petersburg, I tell you. Of 
course, it’s just a bare little short 
story at the moment, but I’ll 
probably think of a couple of in- 
cidents to pad it out.” 

Travel to the Moon and the 
other planets of the Solar System, 
let alone a voyage to the center 
of the Galaxy — in his pajamas? 
No, that was definitely not a 
menu calculated to make Clyde 
Manship salivate. In this respect, 
he had wisted no farther afield 
than a glimpse, say, of Victor 
Hugo’s sky-high balcony in St. 
Germain de Pres or the isles of 
Greece where burning Sappho 
loved and, from time to time as 
it occurred to her, sang. 

Professor Bowles, now, Bowles 
or any of the other slipstick-sniff- 
ers in the physics department — 
what those boys would give to be 
in his position! To be the subject 
of an actual experiment far be- 
yond the dreams of even theory 
on Earth, to be exposed to a techr 
nology that was patently so much 
more advanced than theirs — why, 
they would probably consider 
that, in exchange for all this, the 
vivisection that Manship was 
morosely certain would end the 
evening’s festivities was an excel- 
lent bargain and verged on privi- 
lege. The physics department . 

16 



■VTANSHIP suddenly recalled 
the intricately weird tower, 
studded with gray dipoles, that 
the physics department had been 
erecting in Murphy field. He’d 
watched the government-subsi- 
dized project in radiation re- 
search going up from his window 
in Callahan Hall. 

Only the evening before, when 
it had reached the height of his 
window, he’d reflected that it 
looked more like a medieval siege 
engine designed to bring down 
walled cities than a modern com- 
municative device. 

But now, with Lirld’s comment 
about one-way teleportation nev- 
er having worked before, he 
found himself wondering whether 
the uncompleted tower, poking 
a ragged section of electronic 
superstructure at his bedroom 
window, had been partially re- 
sponsible for this veritable puree- 
of-nightmare he’d been wading 
through. 

Had it provided a necessary 
extra link with Lirld’s machine, 
sort of an aerial connection or 
grounding wire or whatever? If 
only he knew a little physics! 
Eight years of higher education 
were inadequate to suggest the 
barest aye or nay. 

He gnashed his teeth, went too 
far and bit his tongue — and was 
forced to suspend mental opera- 
tions until the pain died away 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and the tears dribbled out of his 
eyes. 

What if he knew for certain 
that the tower had played a po- 
tent, though passive, part in his 
removal through interstellar 
space? What if he knew the exact 
part it had played in terms of 
megavolts and amperages and so 
forth — would the knowledge be 
the slightest use to him in this 
impossible situation? 

No, he’d still be a hideous flat- 
eyed, non-intelligent monster 
plucked pretty much at random 
from the outer reaches of the 
Universe, surrounded by crea- 
tures to whose minds his sub- 
stantial knowledge of the many 
literatures of astronomical unit 
649-301-3 would probably come 
across, allowing even for the 
miracle of translation, as so much 
schizophrenic word-salad. 

In his despair, he plucked 
hopelessly at the material in 
which he’d been wrapped. Two 
small sections came away in his 
fingers. 

There wasn’t enough light to 
examine them, but the feel was 
unmistakable. Paper. He was 
wrapped in an oversized sheet of 
something very much like paper. 

It made sense, he thought, it 
made sense in its own weird way. 
Since the appendages of the fief- 
nobes he had seen to date con- 
sisted of nothing more than slen- 



der tentacles ending in either 
eyes or tapered points, and since 
they seemed to need knoblike 
protuberances on the laboratory 
table in order to perch beside 
him, a cage of paper was pretty 
much escape-proof from their 
point of view. There was nothing 
for their tentacles to grip — and 
they evidently didn’t have the 
musculature to punch their way 
through. 

Well, he did. Athletically, he 
had never amounted to much, but 
he believed, given enough of an 
emergency, in his ability to fight 
his way out of a paper bag. It 
was a comforting thought, but, at 
the moment, only slightly more 
useful than the nugget about the 
tower in Murphy Field. 

If only there were some way 
of transmitting that bit of infor- 
mation to Lirld’s little group: 
Maybe they’d realize that the 
current flefnobe version of The 
Mindless Horror trom Hyper- 
space had a few redeeming intel- 
lectual qualities, and maybe they 
could work out a method of send- 
ing him back. If they wanted to. 

Only he couldn’t transmit in- 
formation. All he could do, for 
some reason peculiar to the wide- 
ly separate evolutionary paths of 
man and flefnobe, was receive. So 
former Assistant Professor Clyde 
Manship sighed heavily, slumped 
his shoulders yet a further slump 



THE FIAT-EYED MONSTER 



17 



— and stolidly set himself to re- 
ceive. 

TTE ALSO straightened his pa- 
jamas about him tenderly, 
not so much from latent sartorial 
ambition as because of agonizing 
twinges of nostalgia: he had sud- 
denly realized that the inexpen- 
sive green garment with its heav- 
ily standardized cut was the only 
artifact he retained of his own 
world. It was the single souvenir, 
so to speak, that he possessed of 
the civilization which had pro- 
duced both Tamurlane and Terza 
Rima; the pajamas were, in fact, 
outside of his physical body, his 
last link with Earth. 

“So far as I’m concerned,” 
Glomg’s explorer son was com- 
menting — it was obvious that 
the argument had been breezing 
right along and that the papery 
barrier didn’t affect Manship’s 
“hearing” in the slightest — “I 
can take these alien monsters or 
leave them alone. When they get 
as downright disgusting as this, 
of course, I’d rather leave them 
alone. But what I mean — I’m 
not afraid of tampering with the 
infinite, like Pop here, and on the 
other side, I can’t believe that 
what you’re doing, Professor 
Lirld, will ever lead to anything 
really important.” 

He paused, then went on. “I 
hope I haven’t hurt your feelings, 

18 



sir, but that’s what I honestly 
think. I’m a practical flefnobe, 
and I believe in practical things.” 
“How can you say — nothing 
really important?” In spite of 
Rabd’s apology, the professor’s 
mental “voice” as it registered on 
Manship’s brain positively undu- 
lated with indignation. “Why, the 
greatest concern of flefnobe sci- 
ence at the moment is to achieve 
a voyage to some part of the out- 
er Galaxy where the distances be- 
tween stars are prodigious com- 
pared to their relative denseness 
here at the galactic center. 

“We can travel at will between 
the fifty-four planets of our sys- 
tem and we have recently 
achieved flight to several of our 
neighboring suns, but going so 
far as even the middle areas of 
the Galaxy, where this specimen 
originates, remains as visionary 
a project today as it was before 
the dawn of extra-atmospheric 
flight over two centuries ago.” 
“Right!” Rabd broke in sharp- 
ly. “And why? Because we don’t 
have the ships capable of making 
the journey? Not on your semble- 
swol, Professor! Why, since the 
development of the Bulvonn 
Drive, any ship in the flefnobe 
navy or merchant marine, down 
to my little three-jet runabout, 
could scoot out to a place as far 
as astronomical unit 649-301-3 
— to name just one example — 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and back without even hotting 
up her engines. But we don’t. And 
for a very good reason.” 

Clyde Manship was now listen- 
ing — or receiving — so hard 
that the two halves of his brain 
seemed to grind against each 
other. He was very much inter- 
ested in astronomical unit 649- 
30 1-3 and anything that made 
travel to it easier or more diffi- 
cult, however exotic the method 
of transportatidh employed might 
be by prevailing terrestrial stand- 
ards. 

“And the reason, of course,” the 
young explorer went on, “is a 
practical one. Mental dwindle. 
Good old mental dwindle. In two 
hundred years of solving every 
problem connected with space 
travel, we haven’t so much as 
pmbffed the surface of that one. 
All we have to do is go a measly 
twenty light-years from the sur- 
face of our home planet and men- 
tal dwindle sets in with a bang. 
The brightest crews start acting 
like retarded children and, if they 
don’t turn back right away, their 
minds go out like so many lights: 
they’ve dwindled mentally smack 
down to zero.” 

I T FIGURED, Manship decided 
excitedly, it figured. A tele- 
pathic race like the flefnobes . 
why, of course! Accustomed since 
earliest infancy to having the 



mental aura of the entire species 
about them at all times, depend- 
ent completely on telepathy for 
communication since there had 
never been a need for developing 
any other method, what loneli- 
ness, what ultimate magnification 
of loneliness, must they not feel 
once their ships had reached a 
point too far from their world to 
maintain contact! 

And their education now — 
Manship could only guess at the 
educational system of a creature 
so different from himself, but 
surely it must be a kind of high- 
order and continual mental os- 
mosis, a mutual mental osmosis. 
However it worked, their educa- 
tional system probably accentu- 
ated the involvement of the indi- 
vidual with the group. Once the 
feeling of involvement became 
too tenuous, because of interven- 
ing barrier or overpowering stellar 
distance, the flefnobe’s psycho- 
logical disintegration was inevit- 
able. 

But all this was unimportant. 
There were interstellar space- 
ships in existence! There were 
vehicles that could take Clyde 
Manship back to Earth, back to 
Kelly University and the work- 
in-progress he hoped would even- 
tually win him a full professor- 
ship in comparative literature: 
Style vs. Content in Fifteen Rep- 
resentative Corporation Reports 



THE FLAT-EYED MONSTER 



19 



to Minority Stockholders for the 
Period 1919-1931. 

For the first time, hope sprang 
within his breast. A moment later, 
it was lying on its back and mas- 
saging a twisted knee. Because 
assume, just assume for the sake 
of argument, his native intelli- 
gence told him, that he could 
somehow get out of this place 
and pick his way about what was, 
by every indication, a complete 
oddity of a world, until he found 
the spaceships Rabd had men- 
tioned — could it ever be be- 
lieved by any imagination no 
matter how wild or fevered, his 
native intelligence continued, that 
he, Clyde Manship, whose fingers 
were all thumbs and whose 
thumbs were all knuckles, whose 
mechanical abilities would have 
made Swanscombe Man sneer 
and Sinanthropus snicker, could 
it be ever believed, his native in- 
telligence inquired sardonically, 
that he’d be capable of working 
out the various gadgets of ad- 
vanced spaceship design, let alone 
the peculiarities that highly un- 
usual creatures like the flefnobes 
would inevitably have incorpor- 
ated into their vessels? 

Clyde Manship was forced to 
admit morosely that the entire 
project was somewhat less than 
possible. But he did tell his native 
intelligence to go straight to hell. 

20 



TJABD now, though. Rabd 
•*-*- could pilot him back to Earth 
if (a) Rabd found it worth-while 
personally and if (b) Rabd could 
be communicated with. Well, 
what interested Rabd most? Evi- 
dently this Mental Dwindle 
ranked quite high. 

“If you’d come up with an an- 
swer to that, Professor,” he was 
expostulating at this point, “I 
would cheer so hard I’d unship 
my glrnk. That’s what’s kept us 
boxed up here at the center of 
the Galaxy for too many years. 
That’s the practical problem. But 
when you haul this Qrm-forsaken 
blob of protoplasm out of its hole 
halfway across the Universe and 
ask me what I think of it, I must 
tell you the whole business leaves 
me completely dry. This, to me, 
is not a practical experiment.” 

Manship caught the mental 
ripples of a nod from Rabd’s 
father. “I’m forced to agree with 
you, son. Impractical and danger- 
ous. And I think I can get the 
rest of the council to see it my 
way. Far too much has been 
spent on this project already.” 

As the resonance of their 
thoughts decreased slightly in 
volume, Manship deduced they 
were leaving the laboratory. 

He heard the beginnings of a 
desperate, “But — but — ” from 
Lirld. Then, off in the distance, 
Councilor Glomg, evidently hav- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ing dismissed the scientist, asked 
his son a question, “And where is 
little Tekt? I thought she’d be 
with you.” 

“Oh, she’s out at the landing 
field,” Rabd answered, “supervis- 
ing last-minute stuff going into 
the ship. After all, we begin our 
mating flight tonight.” 

“A wonderful female,” Glomg 
told him in a “voice” that was 
now barely audible. “You’re a 
very lucky flefnobe.” 

“I know that, Pop,” Rabd as- 
sured him. “Don’t think I don’t 
know that. The most plentiful 
bunch of eye-ended tentacles this 
side of Gansibokkle and they’re 
mine, all mine!” 

“Tekt is a warm and highly 
intelligent female flefnobe,” his 
father pointed out severely from 
a great distance. “She has many 
fine qualities. I don’t like you act- 
ing as if the mating process were 
a mere matter of the number of 
eye-ended tentacles possessed by 
the female.” 

“Oh, it isn’t, Pop,” Rabd as- 
sured him. “It isn’t at all. The 
mating process is a grave and — 
er, a serious matter to me. Full 
of responsibilities — er, serious 
responsibilities. Yes, sir. Highly 
serious. But the fact that Tekt 
has over a hundred and seventy- 
six slime-washed tentacles, each 
topped by a lovely, limpid eye, 
won’t do our relationship a bit of 



harm. Quite the contrary, Pop, 
quite the contrary.” 

“A superstitious old crank and 
a brash bumpkin,” Professor Lirld 
commented bitterly. “But be- 
tween them, they can have my 
appropriation shut off, Srin. They 
can stop my work. Just when it’s 
showing positive results. We’ve 
got to prepare countermeasures!” 

’V/fANSHIP was not interested 
in this all-too-familiar aca- 
demic despair, however. He was 
straining desperately after the re- 
ceding minds of Glomg and 
Rabd. Not that he was at all in- 
trigued by the elder’s advice on 
How to Have a Sane and Happy 
Sex Life though Married. 

What had excited him prodi- 
giously was a mental by-product 
of a much earlier comment. 
When Rabd had mentioned the 
last-minute loading of his ship, 
another part of the flefnobe’s 
mind had, as if stimulated by 
association, dwelt briefly on the 
construction of the small vessel, 
its maintenance and, most im- 
portant, its operation. 

For just a few seconds, there 
had been a flash of a control 
panel with varicolored lights go- 
ing on and off, and the begin- 
nings of long-ago, often-repeated 
instruction: “To warm up the 
motors of the Bulvonn Drive, 
first gently rotate the uppermost 



THE FLAT-EYED MONSTER 



21 



three cylinders . Gently now!” 

It was the kind of subliminal 
thought-picture, Manship real- 
ized excitedly, that had emanated 
from Srin a short while ago, and 
had enabled him to guess that 
the shifting light-patterns on the 
sphere the laboratory assistant 
held were actually meter read- 
ings. Evidently, his sensitivity to 
the flefnobe brain went deeper 
than the mental statements that 
were consciously transmitted by 
it and penetrated, if not the un- 
conscious mind, at least the less 
submerged areas of personal 
awareness and memory. 

But this meant — this meant 
— seated as he was, he still man- 
aged to stagger at the concept. A 
little practice, just a little ac- 
quired skill, and he could no 
doubt pick the brain of every 
flefnobe on the planet. 

He sat and glowed at the 
thought. An ego that had never 
been particularly robust had been 
taking an especially ferocious 
pounding in the past half-hour 
under the contemptuous scrutiny 
of a hundred turquoise eyes and 
dozens of telepathic gibes. A per- 
sonality that had been power- 
starved most of its adult life 
abruptly discovered it might well 
hold the fate of an entire planet 
in the hollow of its cerebrum. 

Yes, this certainly made him 
feel a lot better. Every bit of in- 

22 



formation these flefnobes pos- 
sessed was his for the taking. 
What, for example, did he feel 
like taking? For a starter, that is. 

Manship remembered. His eu- 
phoria dwindled like a spat-upon 
match. There was only one piece 
of information he desired, only 
one thing he wanted to know. 
How to get home! 

O NE of the few creatures on 
this planet, possibly the only 
one for all he knew, whose 
thoughts were of a type to make 
this possible, was on his way 
with his father to some flefnobe 
equivalent of Tony’s Bar and 
Grill. Rabd had, in fact, to judge 
from the silence reigning on the 
subject, just this moment passed 
out of effective telepathic range. 

With a hoarse, anguished, 
yearning cry, similar to that of a 
bull who — having got in a juicy 
lick with his horns and having 
been carried by the momentum 
of his rush the full length of the 
bull-ring — turns, only to see the 
attendants dragging the wounded 
matador out of the arena. With 
precisely that sort of thoroughly 
dismayed bellow, Clyde Manship 
reached up, tore the surrounding 
material apart with one mighty 
two-handed gesture, and leaped 
to his feet on the in-and-out curv- 
ing table-top. 

“. And seven or eight charts 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



in full color, representing the his- 
tory of teleportation prior to this 
experiment,” Lirld was telling his 
assistant at that moment. “In fact, 
Srin, if you have time to make 
three-dimensional charts, the 
Council is even more likely to be 
impressed. We’re in a fight, Srin, 
and we’ve got to use every — ” 

His thoughts broke off as an 
eye-stalk curled around and re- 
garded Manship. A moment later 
his entire complement of eye- 
stalks as well as those of his as- 
sistant swished about and stop- 
ped, quivering, with their focus 
on the erect, emergent human. 

“Holy, concentrated Qrm,” the 
professor’s mind barely transmit- 
ted the quavering thought. “The 
flat-eyed monster. It’s broken 
loose!” 

“Out of a cage of solid paper!” 
Srin added in awe. 

Lirld came to a decision. “The 
blaster,” he ordered peremptorily. 
“Tentacle me the blaster, Srin. 
Appropriation or no appropria- 
tion, we don’t dare take chances 
with a creature like this. We’re 
in a crowded city. Once it got out 
on a rampage — ” He shuddered 
the entire black suitcase length 
of him. He made a rapid adjust- 
ment in the curlicued instrument 
that Srin had given him. He 
pointed it at Manship. 

Having actually fought his 
way out of the paper bag, Man- 



ship had paused, irresolute, on 
the table-top. Far from being a 
man of action in any sense, he 
now found himself distinctly puz- 
zled as to just which way to act. 
He had no idea of the direction 
taken by Glomg pere and tils; 
furthermore he was at a loss as 
he looked around for anything 
that in any way resembled a 
door. He regretted very much 
not having noticed through which 
aperture Rabd had entered the 
room upon the occasion of the 
younger flefnobe’s joining their 
jolly little Circle. 

He had just about made up 
his mind to look into a series of 
zig-zag indentations in the oppo- 
site wall, when he observed Lirld 
pointing the blaster at him with 
determined if unprofessional tre- 
mulousness. His mind, which had 
been filing the recent conversa- 
tion between professor and assis- 
tant in an uninterested back-por- 
tion, suddenly informed him that 
he was about to become the first, 
and probably unrecorded victim, 
in a War of Worlds. 

“Hey!” he yelped, entirely for- 
getting his meager powers of 
communication. “I just want to 
look up Rabd. I’m not going on 
any ramp — ” 

Lirld did something to the 
curlicued instrument that seemed 
like winding a clock, but was 
probably more equivalent to the 



THE FLAT-EYED MONSTER 



23 




pressing of a trigger. He simul- 
taneously shut all of his eyes — 
no mean feat in itself. 



HAT, Clyde Manship reflect- 
ed later — when there was 
time and space to reflect — was 
the only thing which saved his 
life. That and the prodigious side- 

24 



ways broad-jump he made as mil- 
lions of crackling red dots ripped 
out of the instrument toward him. 

The red dots sped past his pa- 
jama-tops and into one of the 
lower vaults that made up the 
ceiling. Without a sound, a hole 
some ten feet in circumference 
appeared in the masonry. The 
hole was deep enough — some 
three or four feet — to let the 
night sky of the planet show 
through. A heavy haze of white 
powder drifted down like the dust 
from a well-beaten rug. 

Staring at it, Manship felt the 
roll of tiny glaciers toward his 
heart. His stomach flattened out 
against its abdominal wall and 
tried to skulk quietly around his 
ribs. He had never felt so com- 
pletely frightened in his life. 
“Hey-y-y — ” he began. 

“A little too much power, Pro- 
fessor,” Srin observed judiciously 
from where he rested easily with 
tentacles outspread against the 
wall. “A little too much power 
and not enough glrnk. Try a little 
more glrnk and see what hap- 
pens.” 

“Thank you,” Lirld told him 
gratefully. “Like this, you mean?” 

He raised and pointed the in- 
strument again. 

“Hey-y-y!” Manship continued 
in the same vein as before, not 
so much because he felt the re- 
sults of such a statement would 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





be particularly rewarding as be- 
cause he lacked, at the moment, 
the creative faculties for another, 
more elaborate comment. “Hey- 
y-y-y!” he repeated between chat- 
tering teeth, staring at Lirld out 
of eyes no longer entirely flat. 

He held up a shaking, admon- 
ishing hand. Fear was gibbering 



through him like the news of 
panic through a nation of mon- 
keys. He watched the flefnobe 
make the peculiar winding trig- 
ger adjustment again. His 
thoughts came to a stop and 
every muscle in his body seemed 
to tense unendurably. 

Suddenly Lirld shook. He slid 



THE FLAT-EYED MONSTER 



25 



backward along the table-top. 
The weapon dropped out of stif- 
fened tentacles and smashed into 
bunches of circular wires that 
rolled in all directions. “Srin!” 
his mind whimpered. “Srin! The 
monster — Do — do you see 
what’s coming out of his eyes? 
He’s — he’s — ” 

His body cracked open and a 
pale, blue goo poured out. Ten- 
tacles dropped off him like so 
many long leaves in a brisk au- 
tumn wind. The eyes that stud- 
ded his surface turned from tur- 
quoise to a dull brown. “Srin!” 
he begged in a tiny, faraway 
thought. “Help me — the flat- 
eyed monster is — help — help!” 

And then he dissolved. Where 
he had been, there was nothing 
but a dark liquid, streaked with 
blue, that flowed and bubbled 
and dripped off the curving edge 
of the table. 

Manship stared at it uncom- 
prehendingly, realizing only one 
thing fully — he was still alive. 

A flicker of absolutely mad, 
stampeding fear reached him 
from Srin’s mind. The laboratory 
assistant jumped from the wall 
against which he’d been stand- 
ing, skidded across the table-top 
with thrashing tentacles, paused 
for a moment at the knobs that 
lined its edge to get the neces- 
sary traction — and then leaped 
in an enormous arc to the far 

26 



wall of the building. The zig-zag 
indentations widened in a sort 
of lightning flash to let his body 
through. 

So that had been a door after 
all. Manship found himself feel- 
ing rather smug at the deduction. 
With so little to go on — pretty 
smart, pretty smart. 

A ND then the various parts of 
his brain caught up with cur- 
rent events and he began trem- 
bling from the reaction. He 
should be dead, a thing of shred- 
ded flesh and powdered bone. 
What had happened? 

Lirld had fired the weapon at 
him and missed the first time. 
Just as he was about to fire again, 
something had struck the flef- 
nobe about as hard as it had the 
Assyrian back in the days when 
the latter was in the habit of com- 
ing down like the wolf on the 
fold. What? Manship had been 
using no weapon of his own. He 
had, so far as he knew, no ally 
on this world. He looked about 
the huge, vaulted room. Silence. 
There was nothing else, nobody 
else in the place. 

What was it the professor had 
screamed telepathically before he 
turned into soup? Something 
about Manship’s eyes? Some- 
thing coming out of the Earth- 
man’s eyes? 

Still intensely puzzled — and 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



despite his relief at having sur- 
vived the last few minutes — 
Manship could not help regret- 
ting Lirld’s extinction. Possibly 
because of his somewhat s'milar 
occupational status, the flefnobe 
had been the only creature of 
his type toward whom Manship 
felt any sympathy. He felt a little 
lonelier now — and, obscurely, 
a little guilty. 

The different thoughts which 
had been mashing themselves to 
and fro in his mind abruptly dis- 
appeared, to be replaced by a 
highly important observation. 

The zig-zag doorway through 
which Srin had fled was closing, 
was coming together! And, as far 
as Manship knew, it was the 
only way out of the place! 

Manship bounced off the huge 
table-top in a jump that for the 
second time in ten minutes did 
great credit to a few semester 
hours of gym some six years ago. 
He reached the narrowing gap, 
prepared to claw his way through 
the solid stone if necessary. 

He was determined not to be 
trapped in this place when the 
flefnobe police closed in with 
whatever they used in place of 
tear gas and machine guns. He 
had also not forgotten the need 
to catch up to Rabd and get two 
or three more driving lessons. 

To his intense relief, the aper- 
ture dilated again as he was 

THE FLAT-EYED MONSTER 



about to hit it. Some sort of pho- 
toelectric gadget, he wondered, or 
was it just sensitive to the ap- 
proach of a body? 

He charged through, and for 
the first time found himself on 
the surface of the planet with 
the night sky all around him. 

T HE view of the sky almost 
took his breath away and 
made him forget, temporarily, the 
utterly strange city of the flef- 
nobes that stretched away in 
every direction. 

There were so many stars! It 
was as if these stellar bodies were 
so much confectioners’ sugar and 
someone had tossed a bagful at 
the heavens. They glowed with 
enough luminosity to maintain a 
three-quarters twilight. There 
was no moon, but its lack was 
not felt; rather it seemed that 
half a dozen moons had been 
broken up into quadrillions of 
tiny white dots. 

It would be impossible, in this 
plenty, to trace out a single con- 
stellation. It would be necessary, 
instead, Manship guessed, to 
speak of a third brightest patch, 
a fifth largest sector. Truly, here 
in the center of the Galaxy, one 
did not merely see the stars — - 
one lived amongst them! 

He noticed his feet were wet. 
Glancing down, he saw he was 
standing in a very shallow stream 

27 



of some reddish liquid that flowed 
between the rounded flefnobe 
buildings. Sewage disposal? Wat- 
er supply? Probably neither, 
probably something else com- 
pletely out of the range of human 
needs. For there were other col- 
ored streams flowing parallel to 
it, Manship saw now — green 
ones, mauve ones, bright pink 
ones. At a street intersection a 
few yards from him, the reddish 
stream flowed away by itself 
down a sort of alley, while a few 
new colored ribbons joined the 
main body. 

Well, he wasn’t here to work 
out problems in extraterrestrial 
sociology. He already had the 
sniffling intimations of a bad 
head cold. Not only his feet were 
wet in this spongelike atmos- 
phere; his pajamas clung to his 
skin in dampest companionship 
and, every once in a while, his 
eyes got blurry with the moisture 
and he had to brush them dry 
with the back of a hand. 

Furthermore, while he was not 
hungry, he had not only seen 
nothing resembling human-type 
victuals since his arrival, but also 
no evidence to suggest that the 
flefnobes had stomachs, let alone 
mouths. 

Maybe they took in nourish- 
ment through the skin, soaked it 
up, say, from those differently 
colored streams than ran through 

28 



their city. Red might be meat, 
green could be vegetables, while 
for dessert — 

He clenched his fists and shook 
himself. I’ve no time for any of 
this philosophic badminton, he 
told himself fiercely. In just a 
few hours, I’m going to be ex- 
tremely hungry and thirsty. I’m 
also going to be extremely hunt- 
ed. I’d better get moving — work 
out some solutions! 

Only where? Fortunately, the 
street outside Lirld’s laboratory 
seemed deserted. Maybe the flef- 
nobes were afraid of the dark? 
Maybe they were all good, re- 
spectable homebodies and every- 
one, without exception, toddled 
into his bed at night to sleep the 
darkness through? Maybe — 

Rabd. He had to find Rabd. 
That was the beginning and the 
end of the only solution to his 
problems he had come even close 
to, since his materialization on 
Professor Lirld’s lab table. 

Rabd. 

TTE TRIED' “listening” with 
his mind. All kinds of drift- 
ing, miscellaneous thoughts were 
sloshing around in his brain, from 
the nearer inhabitants of the city. 

“All right, darling, all right. If 
you don’t want to gadl, you don’t 
have to gadl. We’ll do something 
else. .” 

“That smart-aleck Bohrg! Will 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I fix him properly tomorrow. .” 
“Do you have three zamshkins 
for a plet? I want to make a long- 
distance send. .” 

“Bohrg will roll in tomorrow 
morning, thinking everything is 
the same as it’s always been. Is 
he going to be surprised. .” 

“I like you, Nernt, I like you 
a lot. And that’s why I feel it’s 
my duty to tell you, strictly as 
a friend, you understand. .” 

“No, darling, I didn’t mean 
that I didn’t want to gadl. I 
thought you didn’t want to; I 
was trying to be considerate like 
you always tell me to be. Of 
course I want to gadl. Now please 
don’t look at me like that. .” 
“Listen here. I can lick any 
flefnobe in the place. 

“To tell you the truth, Nernt, I 
think you’re the only one who 
doesn’t know. Everybody else. ” 
“So you’re all scared, huh? All 
right, I’ll take you on two at a 
time. Come on, come on. .” 

But no hint of Rabd. Manship 
began to walk cautiously down 
the stone-paved street, sloshing 
through the little rivulets. 

He stepped too close to the 
wall of the dark buildings. Im- 
mediately, a zig-zag doorway 
opened its jagged invitation. He 
hesitated for a moment, then 
stepped through. 

Nobody here either. Did the 



flefnobes sleep in some central 
building, dormitory fashion? Did 
they sleep at all? He must re- 
member to tune in on some like- 
ly mind and investigate. The in- 
formation might be useful. 

This building seemed to be a 
warehouse; it was filled with 
shelves. The walls were bare, 
however — there seemed to be 
some flefnobe inhibition against 
putting objects against the walls. 
The shelves rose in tall tiers — 
again free-form shapes — from 
the center of the floor. 

Manship strolled over to the 
shelving that was the height of 
his chest. Dozens of fat green 
balls rested in white porcelain 
cups. Food? Could be. They 
looked distinctly edible, like 
melons. 

He reached out and picked one 
up. It immediately spread wings 
and flew away to the ceiling. 
Every one of the other green 
balls, on all the shelves, spread a 
similar set of multiple, tiny wings 
and flew upward, like so many 
spherical birds whose nests have 
been disturbed. When they 
reached the domed ceiling, they 
seemed to disappear. 

Manship backed out of the 
place hurriedly through the jag- 
ged aperture. He seemed to be 
setting off alarms wherever he 
went! 



THE FLAT-EYED MONSTER 



29 



NCE out in the street, he 
sensed a new feeling. There' 
was a sensation of bubbling ex- 
citement everywhere, a tense 
waiting. Very few individual 
thoughts were coming through. 

Suddenly the restlessness co- 
alesced into an enormous mental 
shout that almost deafened him. 

“Good evening!” it said. “Please 
stand by for an emergency news 
bulletin. This is Pukr, the son of 
Kimp, coming to you on a planet- 
wide, mind-to-mind hookup. Here 
is the latest on the flat-eyed mon- 
ster: 

“At forty-three skims past beb- 
blewort, tonight, this creature 
was materialized by Professor 
Lirld from astronomical unit 649- 
301-3 as part of an experiment 
in one-way teleportation. Counci- 
lor Glomg was present as a wit- 
ness to the experiment in the 
course of his official duties and, 
observing the aggressive way in 
which the monster comported it- 
self, immediately warned Lirld 
of the dangers in letting it remain 
alive. 

“Lirld disregarded the warn- 
ing and, later, after Councilor 
Glomg had departed with his son, 
Rabd, the well-known interplan- 
etary explorer and flefnobe-about- 
town, the monster ran amuck. 
Having fought its way out of a 
cage of solid paper, it attacked 
the professor with an unknown 

30 



type of high-frequency mental 
beam that seems to emanate from 
its unbelievably flat eyes. This 
beam seems to be similar, in ef- 
fect, to that thrown out by sec- 
ond-order grepsas when all fuses 
have blown. Our best psycho- 
physicists are, at this very mo- 
ment, working feverishly on that 
aspect of the problem. 

“But Professor Lirld paid with 
his life for his scientific curiosity 
and for disregarding the warn- 
ings of Councilor Glomg’s experi- 
ence. Despite the best efforts of 
Srin, Lirld’s laboratory assistant, 
who fought a desperate and cou- 
rageous diversionary action in an 
attempt to save the old scientist, 
Lirld perished horribly before the 
monster’s ferocious onslaught. 
With his superior dead, Srin re- 
treated tentacle by tentacle, fight- 
ing all the way, barely managing 
to make his escape in time. 

“This alien monster with its in- 
credible powers is now loose in 
our city! All citizens are urged to 
remain calm, not to panic. Rest 
assured that as soon as tlie au- 
thorities know what to do, they 
will do it. Remember — above 
all — stay calm! 

“Meanwhile, Rabd, the son of 
Glomg, has postponed his mating 
flight which was to have begun 
tonight. He is mating, as you all 
know, with Tekt, the daughter of 
Hilp — Tekt being the well- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



known star of inesh and blelg 
from the southern continent. 
Rabd is leading a troop of volun- 
teer flefnobes to the scientific 
quarters of the city, where the 
monster was last seen, in an at- 
tempt to exterminate it with al- 
ready-existing, conventional wea- 
pons before the creature starts to 
reproduce. I will return with more 
bulletins when they are available. 
That is all for now.” 

T hat was more than enough, 
Manship felt. Now there 
wasn’t any hope that he could 
work out some method of com- 
munication with these creatures 
and sit down for a little quiet 
conversation on ways and means 
of getting himself home — which 
seemed to be a conclusion earn- 
estly desired by all. From now 
on the watchword was going to 
be Get That Manship! 

He didn’t like that at all. 

On the other hand, he didn’t 
have to wander after Rabd. If 
Manship can’t get to the flefnobe, 
the flefnobe will come to Man- 
ship. Heavily armed, however, 
and with homicidal intent. 

He decided he had better hide. 
He stepped up to a building and 
wandered along a wall until the 
doorway opened. He walked 
through and watched it close be- 
hind him, then looked around. 
To his relief, it seemed like an 



excellent place to hide. There 
were quantities of large, heavy 
objects in the center of the place, 
none of them, so far as he could 
tell, alive, and all of them satis- 
factorily opaque. He wedged him- 
self between two of these which 
looked like stored table-tops and 
hoped wistfully that the flefnobe 
sensory appartus did not boast 
any more detective mechanisms 
than he had already experienced. 

What he wouldn’t give to be 
an assistant professor in Kelly 
University again instead of a flat- 
eyed monster ravening, all un- 
wittingly, through an alien metro- 
polis! 

He found himself wondering 
about the strange powers he was 
supposed to possess. What was 
all this nonsense about a high- 
frequency mental beam emanat- 
ing from his eyes? He hadn’t no- 
ticed anything coming out — and 
he should have noticed if any- 
one did, he felt. Yet Lirld had 
made some comment to that ef- 
fect just before he dissolved. 

Was it possible that there was 
some by-product of the human 
brain that was only visible to 
flefnobes and was highly dele- 
terious to them? 

After all, he could tune in on 
the flefnobes’ minds and they 
couldn’t tune in on his. Maybe 
the only way he could make his 
mental presence felt to them was 



THE FLAT-EYED MONSTER 



31 



in some prodigious blast of 
thought which literally ripped 
them apart. 

But he evidently couldn’t turn 
it on and off at will — he hadn’t 
caused the slightest alteration in 
Lirld, the first time the professor 
had fired. 

There were ripples of new, ex- 
cited thoughts reaching him sud- 
denly. They were coming from 
somewhere in the street outside. 

Rabd had arrived with his 
posse. 

f a THREE of you move down 
that way,” the young flef- 
nobe ordered. “I want two each 
to cover the side streets. Don’t 
spend too much time searching 
through the buildings. I’m posi- 
tive we’ll find this monster skulk- 
ing somewhere in the dark streets, 
looking for new victims. Tanj, 
Zogt and Lewv — come with me. 
And keep on your tentacle-tips, 
everybody — this thing is crazy 
dangerous. But remember, we’ve 
got to blast it before it starts re- 
producing. Imagine what this 
planet would be like with a 
couple of hundred of these flat- 
eyed monsters running around!” 

Manship let out a long, slow 
sigh of relief. If they hoped to 
find him on the streets, he might 
have a little time. 

He let his mind follow that of 
Rabd. It wasn’t too hard — just 

32 



a matter of concentration — and 
you pretty much blocked out the 
thoughts of the other individuals. 
Follow Rabd’s mind. Rabd’s 
thoughts. Now block out most ol 
Rabd’s conscious thoughts. There. 
The subliminal layer, the mem 
ory patterns. No, not tlw stuff 
about that female flelnohe lust 
month, all eyes and soft tentacles, 
dammit! 

The memory patterns, the old 
et ones. “When landing on a C 12 
type planet . No, not that one. 
A little further. There! “Having 
fired the forward jet to cleat it, 
gently depress the . .” 

Manship combed through the 
operational instructions in Rahd’s 
mind, pausing every once in a 
while to clear up a concept pe- 
culiar to flefnobe terminology, 
stopping now and then as a grin 
ning thought about Tekt wan- 
dered in and threw everything 
out of focus. 

He noticed that whatever in- 
formation he absorbed in this 
fashion, he seemed to absorb per- 
manently; there was no need to 
go back to previous data. Prob- 
ably left a permanent print on 
his mind, he concluded. 

He had it all now, at least as 
much about running the ship as 
it was possible to understand. In 
the last few moments, he had 
been operating the ship — and 
operating the ship for years and 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




33 




years — at least through Rabd’s 
memories. For the first time, 
Manship began to feel a little 
confident. 

But how was he to find the 
little spaceship in the streets of 
this utterly strange city? He 
clasped his hands in perspired 
bafflement. After all this — 

Then he had the answer. He’d 
get the directions from Rabd’s 
mind. Of course. Good old ency- 
clopedia Rabd! He’d certainly re- 
member where he parked the 
vessel. 

And he did. With a skill that 
seemed to have come from ages 
of practice, Clyde Manship rif- 
fled through the flefnobe’s 
thoughts, discarding this one, ab- 
sorbing that one — “. the indi- 
go stream for five blocks. Then 
take the first merging red one 
and ...” — until he had as thor- 
ough and as permanent a picture 
of the route to Rabd’s three-jet 
runabout as if he’d been studying 
the subject in graduate school 
for six months. 

-pRETTY good going for a 
stodgy young assistant profes- 
sor of Comparative Literature 
who up to this night had about 
as much experience with tele- 
pathy as African lion-hunting! 
But perhaps — perhaps it had 
been a matter of conscious ex- 
perience of telepathy; perhaps 

34 



the human mind was accustomed 
to a sort of regular, deep-in-the- 
brain, unconscious telepathy from 
infancy and being exposed to 
creatures so easy to receive from 
as flefnobes had brought the lat- 
ently exercised powers to the sur- 
face. 

That would explain the quick- 
ly acquired skill that felt so much 
like the sudden surprising ability 
to type whole words and sen- 
tences after months of practicing 
nothing but meaningless combin- 
ations of letters in certain set 
alphabetical patterns. 

Well, it might be interesting, 
but that particular speculation 
was not his field of research and 
not his problem. Not for tonight, 
anyway. 

Right now, what he had to do 
was somehow slip out of the 
building unobserved by the crowd 
of flefnobe vigilantes outside, and 
get on his way fast. After all, it 
might not be long before the 
militia was called out to deal with 
something as viciously destruc- 
tive as himself. 

He slipped out of his hiding- 
place and made for the wall. The 
zig-zag doorway opened. He step- 
ped through — and bowled over 
a tentacled black suitcase who’d 
apparently been coming in. 

The flefnobe recovered fast. 
He pointed his spiraly weapon at 
Manship from where he lay and 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



began winding it. Once more, the 
Earthman went rigid with fright; 
he’d seen what that thing could 
do. To be killed now, after all 
he’d gone through . 

And once more, there was a 
quiver and a mental scream of 
distress from the flefnobe: “The 
flat-eyed monster — - I’ve found 
him — his eyes — his eyes. Zogt, 
Rabd, help! His eyes — ” 

There was nothing left but a 
twitching tentacle or two and a 
puddle of liquid rippling back 
and forth in a little hollow near 
the building wall. Without look- 
ing back, Manship fled. 

A stream of red dots chattered 
over his shoulder and dissolved 
a domed roof directly ahead of 
him. Then he had turned the cor- 
ner and was picking up speed. 
From the dwindling telepathic 
shouts behind him, he deduced 
with relief that feet moved faster 
than tentacles. 

He found the correct colored 
streams and began to work his 
way in the direction of Rabd’s 
spaceship. Only once or twice did 
he come across a flefnobe. And 
none of them seemed to be 
armed. 

At sight of him, these passers- 
by wound their tentacles about 
their bodies, huddled against the 
nearest wall, and, after a few dis- 
mal mutters to the effect of “Qrm 



save me, Qrm save me,” seemed 
to pass out. 

TTE WAS grateful for the ab~ 
sence of heavy traffic, but 
wondered why it should be so, 
especially since he was now mov- 
ing through the residential quar- 
ters of the city according to the 
mental map he had purloined 
from Rabd. 

Another overpowering roar in 
his mind gave him the answer. 

“This is Pukr, the son of Kimp, 
returning to you with more news 
of the flat-eyed monster. First, 
the Council wishes me to notify 
all who have not already been 
informed through their blelg ser- 
vice that a state of martial law 
has been proclaimed in the city. 

“Repeat: a state of martial law 
has been proclaimed in the city! 
All citizens are to stay off the 
streets until further notice. Units 
of the army and space fleet as 
well as heavy maizeltoovers are 
being moved in hurriedly. Don’t 
get in their way! Stay off the 
streets! 

“The flat-eyed monster has 
struck again. Just ten short skims 
ago, it struck down Lewv, the 
son of Yifg, in a running battle 
outside the College of Advanced 
T urkaslerg, almost trampling 
Rabd, the son of Glomg, who 
courageously hurled himself in 
its path in a valiant attempt to

delay the monster’s flight. Rabd, 
however, believes he seriously 
wounded it with a well-placed 
bolt from his blaster. The mon- 
ster’s weapon was the high-fre- 
quency beam from its eyes — — 

“Shortly before this battle, the 
flat-eyed horror from the outer 
galactic wastes had evidently 
wandered into a museum where 
it completely destroyed a valu- 
able collection of green fermf- 
naks. They were found in a use- 
less winged condition. Why did 
it do this? Pure viciousness? 
Some scientists believe that this 
act indicates intelligence of a 
very high order indeed, and that 
this intelligence, together with 
the fantastic powers already in 
evidence, will make the killing 
of the monster a much more diffi- 
cult task than the local authori- 
ties expect. 

“Professor Wuvb is one of 
these scientists. He feels that only 
through a correct psycho-socio- 
logical evaluation of the monster 
and an understanding of the pe- 
culiar cultural milieu from which 
it evidently derives will we be 
able to work out adequate coun- 
ter-measures and save the planet. 
Therefore, in the interests of flef- 
nobe survival, we have brought 
the professor here tonight to give 
you his views. The next mind you 
hear will be that of Professor 
Wuvb.” 



Just as the newcomer began 
portentously, “To understand any 
given cultural milieu, we must 
first ask ourselves what we mean 
by culture. Do we mean, for ex- 
ample — ” Manship reached the 
landing field. 

TTE CAME out upon it near 
-■-■■-the corner on which Rabd’s 
three-jet runabout was parked 
between an enormous interplan- 
etary vessel being loaded with 
freight and what Manship would 
have been certain was a ware- 
house, if he hadn’t learned so 
thoroughly how wrong he could 
be about flefnobe equivalents of 
human activities. 

There seemed to be no guards 
about, the landing field was not 
particularly well-lit, and most of 
the individuals in the neighbor- 
hood were concentrated around 
the freighter. 

He took a deep breath and ran 
for the comparatively tiny, 
spherical ship with the deep hol- 
low in the top and bottom, some- 
thing like an oversized metallic 
apple. He reached it, ran around 
the side until he came to the zig- 
zag line that indicated an en- 
trance and squeezed through. 

As far as he could tell, he 
hadn’t been observed. Outside of 
the mutter of loading and stow- 
age instructions coming from the 
larger ship, there were only Pro-

fessor Wuvb’s louder thoughts 
weaving their intricate socio- 
philosophical web: . So we 

may conclude that in this respect, 
at least, the flat-eyed monster 
does not show the typical basic 
personality pattern of an illiter- 
ate. But then, if we attempt to 
relate the characteristics of a pre- 
literate urban cultural configura- 
tion . 

Manship waited for the door- 
way to contract, then made his 
way hand over hand up a nar- 
row, twisting ladderlike affair to 
the control room of the vessel. 
He seated himself uncomfortably 
before the main instrument panel 
and went to work. 

It was difficult using fingers on 
gadgets which had been designed 
for tentacles, but he had no 
choice. “To warm up the motors 
of the Bulvonn Drive — ” Gently, 
very gently, he rotated the up- 
permost three cylinders a com- 
plete turn each. Then, when the 
rectangular plate to his left began 
to show an even succession of 
red and white stripes across its 
face, he pulled on the large black 
knob protruding from the floor. 
A yowling roar of jets started 
from outside. He worked almost 
without conscious effort, letting 
memory take over. It was as if 
Rabd himself were getting the 
spaceship into operation. 

A few seconds later, he was 



off the planet and in deep space. 

He switched to interstellar 
operation, set the directional in- 
dicator for astronomical unit 649- 
301-3 — and sat back. There 
was nothing else for him to do 
until the time came for landing. 
He was a little apprehensive 
about that part, but things had 
gone so well up to this point that 
he felt quite the interstellar dare- 
devil. “Old Rocketfingers Man- 
ship,” he grinned to himself 
smugly. 

A ccording to Rabd’s subli- 
minal calculations, he should 
be arriving on Earth — given 
the maximum output of the Bul- 
vonn Drive which he was using 
— in ten to twelve hours. He 
was going to be more than a bit 
hungry and thirsty, but — What 
a sensation he was going to make! 
Even more of a sensation than 
he had left behind him. The flat- 
eyed monster with a high-fre- 
quency mental beam coming out 
of its eyes. 

What had that been? All that 
had happened to him, each time 
a flefnobe dissolved before his 
stare, was a good deal of fear. 
He had been terribly frightened 
that he was going to be blasted 
into tiny pieces and had, some- 
where in the process of being 
frightened, evidently been able 
to throw out something pretty 



THE FLAT-EYED MONSTER

tremendous — to judge from re- 
sults. 

Possibly the abnormally high 
secretion of adrenalin in the hu- 
man system at moments of stress 
was basically inimical to flefnobe 
body structure. Or maybe there 
was an entirely mental reaction 
in Man’s brain at such times 
whose emanations caused the 
flefnobes to literally fall part. It 
made sense: 

If he was so sensitive to their 
thoughts, they should be sensi- 
tive to him in some way. And 
obviously, when he was very 
much afraid, that sensitivity 
showed up with a vengeance. 

He put his hands behind his 
head and glanced up to check 
his meters. Everything was work- 
ing satisfactorily. The brown cir- 
cles were expanding and contract- 
ing on the sekkel board, as Rabd’s 
mind had said they should; the 
little serrations on the edge of 
the control panel were moving 
along at a uniform rate, the visi- 
screen showed — the visiscreen! 

Manship leaped to his feet. 
The visiscreen showed what 
seemed to be every vessel in the 
flefnobe army and space fleet — 
not to mention the heavy maizel- 
toovers — in hot pursuit of him. 
And getting closer. 

There was one large spacecraft 
that had almost caught up and 
was beginning to exude a series 



of bright rays that, Manship re- 
membered from Rabd’s recollec- 
tions, were grapples. 

What could have caused all 
this commotion — the theft of a 
single jet runabout? The fear 
that he might steal the secrets of 
flefnobe science? They should 
have been so glad to get rid of 
him, especially before he started 
reproducing hundreds of himself 
all over the planet! 

And then a persistent thought 
ripple from inside his own ship 
— a thought ripple which he had 
been disregarding all the time he 
had been concentrating on the 
unfamiliar problems of deep- 
space navigation — gave him a 
clue. 

He had taken off with some- 
one — or something — else in 
the ship! 

Clyde Manship scurried down 
the twisting ladder to the main 
cabin. As he approached, the 
thoughts became clearer and he 
realized, even before the cabin 
aperture dilated to let him 
through, exactly whom he would 
find. 

Tekt. 

The well-known female star of 
fnesh and blelg from the southern 
continent and Rabd’s about-to- 
be bride cowered in a far corner; 
all of her tentacles — including 
the hundred and seventy-six 
slime-washed ones that were top- 



38 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ped by limpid eyes — twisted 
about her tiny black body in the 
most complicated series of knots 
Manship had ever seen. 

“Oo-ooh!” her mind moaned. 
“Qrm! Qttyi! Now it’s going to 
happen! That awful, horrible 
thing! It’s going to happen to me! 
It’s coming closer — closer — ” 
“Look, lady, I’m not even 
slightly interested in you,” Man- 
ship began, before he remem- 
bered that he’d never been able 
to communicate with any flef- 
nobe before, let alone a hysteri- 
cal female one. 

H E FELT the ship shudder as 
the grapples touched it. Well, 
here I go again, he thought. In 
a moment there would be board- 
ers and he’d have to turn them 
into bluish soup. 

Evidently, Tekt had been 
sleeping aboard the vessel when 
he took off. She’d been waiting 
for Rabd to return and begin 
their mating flight. And she was 
obviously a sufficiently important 
figure to have every last reserve 
called up. 

His mind caught the sensation 
of someone entering the ship. 
Rabd. From what Manship could 
tell, he was alone, carrying his 
trusty blaster — and determined 
to die fighting. 

Well, that’s exactly what he’d 
have to do. Clyde Manship was 



a fairly considerate individual 
and heartily disliked the idea of 
disintegrating a bridegroom on 
what was to have been his honey- 
moon. But, since he had found 
no way of communicating his 
pacific intentions to these crea- 
tures, he had no choice. 

“Tekt!” Rabd telepathed soft- 
ly. “Are you all right?” 

“Murder!” Tekt screamed. 
“Help-help-help-help . .” Her 
thoughts abruptly disappeared; 
she had fainted. 

The zig-zag aperture widened 
and Rabd bounced into the cabin, 
looking like a series of long bal- 
loons in his spacesuit. He glanced 
at the recumbent Tekt and then 
turned desperately, pointing his 
curlicued blaster at Manship. 

“Poor guy,” Manship was 
thinking. “Poor, dumb, narrow- 
minded hero type. In just a sec- 
ond, you’ll be nothing but goo.” 
He waited, full of confidence. 

He was so full of confidence, 
in fact, that he wasn’t a bit fright- 
ened. 

So nothing came out of his 
eyes, nothing but a certain con- 
descending sympathy. 

So Rabd blasted the ugly, ob- 
scene, horrible, flat-eyed thing 
down where it stood. And 
scooped up his bride with loving 
tentacles. And went back home 
to a hero’s reception.

Jack's blunder was disastrous, 
but what he worried about was: 
would Einstein have approved? 



By ALAN 



EAR Mr. Gretch: 

Mrs. Burroughs and I 
are sending your son 
Jack to you because we do not 
know what else to do with him. 
As you can see, we can’t keep 
him with us in his present condi- 
tion. 

Also, Jack owes us two weeks 
rent and, since Mrs. Burroughs 
and I are retired, we would ap- 
preciate your sending the money. 
It has been a dry year and our 
garden has done poorly.

The only reason we put up 
with your son in the first place 
was because we are so hard- 
pressed. 

He saw the sign on the porch, 
rang the bell and paid Mrs. Bur- 
roughs a month’s rent without 
even looking at the room. Then 
he ran out to his car and com- 
menced pulling out suitcases and 
boxes and dragging them up- 
stairs. 

After the third trip, Mrs. Bur- 
roughs saw he was having trouble 

by DIEHL 




40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



with the stuff and he looked kind 
of worn out, so she offered to 
help. 

He gave her a hard look, as 
she described it to me when I got 
home. He said, “I don’t want any- 
one touching anything. Please 
don’t interfere.” 

“I didn’t mean to interfere,” 
my wife told him. “I only wanted 
to help.” 

“I don’t want any help,” he 
said quietly, but with a wild look 
in his eye, and he staggered up- 
stairs with the last of his baggage 
and locked the door. 

W HEN I got home, Mrs. Bur- 
roughs told me she thought 
I ought to take a look at the new 
boarder. I went up, thinking we’d 
have a little chat and straighten 
things out. I could hear him in- 
side, hammering on something. 

He didn’t hear my first knock 
or the second. I got sore and 
nearly banged the door down, at 
which time he decided to open 

up. 

I charged in, ready to fight a 
bear. And there was this skinny 
red-headed son of yours glaring 
at me. 

“That’s a lot of hammering 
you’re doing, son,” I said. 

“That’s the only way I can get 
these boxes open, and don’t call 
me son.” 

“I don’t like to disturb you, 
Mr. Gretch, but Mrs. Burroughs 



is a little upset over the way you 
acted today. I think you ought to 
come down for a cup of tea and 
get acquainted.” 

“I know I was rude,” he said, 
looking a little ashamed, “but I 
have waited for years for a 
chance to get to work on my own, 
with no interference. I’ll come 
down tomorrow, when I have got 
my equipment set up, and apolo- 
gize to Mrs. Burroughs then.” 

I asked him what he was work- 
ing on, but he said he would ex- 
plain later. Before I got out of 
the door, he was hammering 
again. He worked till after mid- 
night. 

We saw Jack at mealtimes for 
the next few days, but he didn’t 
talk much. We learned that he 
was twenty-six, in spite of his 
looking like a boy in his teens, 
that he thought Prof. Einstein 
the greatest man ever, and that 
he disliked being called son. Of 
his experiment, he didn’t have 
much to say then. He saw Mrs. 
Burroughs was a little nervous 
about his experimenting in the 
guest room and he assured her 
it was not dangerous. 

Before the week was out, we 
started hearing the noises. The 
first one was like a wire brush 
going around a barrel. It went 
whisk, whisk. Then he rigged up 
something that went skaboom 
every few seconds, like a loud 
heartbeat. Once in a while, he

41

got in a sound like a creaky well 
pump, but mostly it was ska- 
boom, and whisk, which eventu- 
ally settled down to a steady 
rhythm, whiskaboom, whiska- 
boom. 

It was kind of pleasant. 

TV" EITHER of us saw him for 

' two days. The noises kept 
going on. Mrs. Burroughs was 
alarmed because he did not an- 
swer her knock at mealtimes, and 
one morning she charged upstairs 
and hollered at him through the 
door. 

“You stop your nonsense this 
minute and come down to break- 
fast!” 

“I’m not hungry,” he called 
back. 

“You open this door!” she ord- 
ered and, by George, he did. 
“Your whiskaboom or whatever it 
is will keep till after breakfast.” 

He sat at the table, but he was 
a tired boy. He had a cold, his 
eyelids kept batting, and I don’t 
believe he could have lifted his 
coffee cup. He tried to look 
awake, and then over he went 
with his face in the oatmeal. 

Mrs. Burroughs ran for the 
ammonia, but he was out cold, 
so we wiped the oatmeal off his 
face and carried him upstairs. 

My wife rubbed Jack’s wrists 
with garlic and put wet towels on 
his face, and presently he came 
to. He looked wildly about the 



room at his machinery. It was all 
there, and strange-looking stuff, 
too. 

“Please go away,” he begged. 
“I’ve got work to do.” 

Mrs. Burroughs helped him 
blow his nose. “There’ll be no 
work for you, sonny. Not until 
you’re well. We’ll take care of 
you.” He didn’t seem to mind 
being called sonny. 

He was sick for a week and we 
tended him like one of our own. 
We got to know him pretty well. 
And we also got to know you. 

Now, Mr. Gretch, whatever 
you are doing in your laboratory 
is your own business. You could 
be making atomic disintegrators, 
for all Jack told us. But he does 
not like or approve of it and he 
told us about your running battle 
with him to keep him working 
on your project instead of his 
own. 

Jack tried to explain his ideas 
for harnessing time and what he 
called “the re-integration princi- 
ple.” It was all so much whiska- 
boom to us, so to speak, but he 
claimed it was for the good of 
mankind, which was fine with us. 

But he said you would not let 
him work it out because there 
was less money in it than in your 
project, and this is why he had 
to get away and work and worry 
himself into a collapse. 

When he got well, Mrs. Bur- 
roughs told him, “From now on, 



WHISKABOOM 



43 



you’re going to have three meals 
a day and eight hours sleep, and 
in between you can play on your 
whiskaboom all you please.” 

The whiskabooming became as 
familiar to us as our own voices. 

Last Sunday, Mrs. Burroughs 
and I came home from church, 
about noon. She went inside 
through the front door to fix din- 
ner. I walked around the house 
to look at the garden. And the 
moment I walked past the front 
of the house, I got the shock of 
my life. 

The house disappeared! 

1 WAS too surprised to stop 
walking, and a step later I was 
standing at the back of the house, 
and it was all there. I took a step 
back and the whole house van- 
ished again. One more step and 
I was at the front. 

It looked like a real house in 
front and in back, but there 
wasn’t any in-between. It was like 
one of those false-front saloons 
on a movie lot, but thinner. 

I thought of my wife, who had 
gone into the kitchen and, for all 
I knew, was as thin as the house, 
and I went charging in the back 
door, yelling. 

“Are you all right?” 

“Of course I’m all right,” she 
said. “What’s the matter with 
you?” 

I grabbed her and she was all 
there, thank heavens. She giggled 

44 



and called me an old fool, but I 
dragged her outside and showed 
her what had happened to our 
house. 

She saw it, too, so I knew I 
didn’t have sunstroke, but she 
couldn’t understand it any better 
than I. 

Right about then, I detected a 
prominent absence of whiska- 
booming. “Jack!” I hollered, and 
we hurried back into the house 
and upstairs. 

Well, Mr. Gretch, it was so 
pitiful, I can’t describe it. He was 
there, but I never saw a more 
miserable human being. He was 
not only thin but also flat, like a 
cartoon of a man who had been 
steamrollered. He was lying on 
the bed, holding onto the covers, 
with no more substance to him 
than a thin piece of paper. Less. 

Mrs. Burroughs took one of his 
shoulders between her thumb and 
forefinger, and I took the other, 
and we held him up. There was 
a breeze coming through the win- 
dow and Jack — well, he waved 
in the breeze. 

We closed the window and 
laid him down again and he tried 
to explain what had happened. 
“Professor Einstein wouldn’t have 
liked this!” he moaned. “Some- 
thing went wrong,” he cried, shud- 
dering. 

He went on gasping and 
mumbling, and we gathered that 
he had hooked up a circuit the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



wrong way. “I didn’t harness the 
fourth — I chopped off the third 
dimension! Einstein wouldn’t 
have approved!” 

He was relieved to learn that 
the damage had been confined to 
himself and the house, so far as 
we knew. Like the house, Jack 
had insides, but we don’t know 
where they are. We poured tea 
down him, and he can eat, after 
a fashion, but there never is a 
sign of a lump anywhere. 

T HAT night, we pinned him to 
the bed with clothespins so 
he wouldn’t blow off the bed. 
Next morning, we rigged a line 
and pinned him to it so he could 
sit up. 

“I know what to do,” he said, 
“but I would have to go back to 
the lab. Dad would have to let 
me have his staff and all sorts of 
equipment. And he won’t do it.” 
“If he thinks more of his money 
than he does of his own son,” Mrs. 
Burroughs said, “then he’s an un- 
natural father.” 

But Jack made us promise not 
to get in touch with you. 

Still, people are beginning to 



talk. The man from the electric 
company couldn’t find the meter 
yesterday, because it is attached 
to the middle of the outside wall 
and has vanished. 

Mr. Gretch, we are parents and 
we feel that you will not hesitate 
a moment to do whatever is 
necessary to get Jack back into 
shape. So, despite our promise, 
we are sending Jack to you by 
registered parcel post, air mail. 
He doesn’t mind the cardboard 
mailing tube he is rolled up in as 
he has been sleeping in it, finding 
it more comfortable than being 
pinned to the sheets. 

Jack is a fine boy, sir, and we 
hope to hear soon that he is back 
to normal and doing the work he 
wants to do. 

Very truly yours, 
W. Burroughs 

P.S. When Jack figures out the 
re-integration principle, we would 
appreciate his fixing our house. 
We get along as usual, but it 
makes us nervous to live in a 
house that, strictly speaking, has 
no insides. W.B.

Country Estate 



By DANIEL F. GALOUYE 



No galactic job was more ugly than breaking 
the spirits of happy primitives . and this 
was the happiest race Man had ever reached! 



Illustrated by DOCKTOR 



F ROM the beginning, the 
primitives were a paradox. 
We found them living as 
aborigines, without shelter or 
clothing. They hadn’t developed 
even a rudimentary language. 
Yet they were not without con- 
siderable dignity. 

They were a clean race with 
sharp, searching eyes. Neverthe- 
less, a few simple games and an 
intriguing group dance which 
they performed with fanatic fer- 
vor were the extent of their social 
achievement. 

They had the tractability of

animals. Yet the haughty tilt of 
their heads suggested their com- 
pliance would never degenerate 
into servility. I even sensed an 
indifference to the miracle of our 
arrival. 

Numbering more than a hun- 
dred, they were expectantly si- 
lent as they stood in the shadow 
of the ship, monitoring Sharp’s 
moves with alertly curious and 
unawed eyes. 

Sunlight glinted on metal as he 
elevated the flagstaff and brought 
it stabbing down into the ground. 

“As commander of this expedi- 
tion,” he proclaimed, “I claim this 
planet in the name of the Feder- 
ated Worlds.” 

The declaration was a formali- 
ty. Later, after the primitives 
learned the Universal tongue, 
they would ultimately grasp its 
implications. 

Sharp rubbed a stiff finger pen- 
sively along his cheek and turned 
toward me. “So they have no 
articulate status, Norton?” 

“No, sir.” 

He frowned. “What do you 
make of it, Ron? Can a race look 
as intelligent as these do and 
still not have a language?” 

I shrugged. “It’s possible. En- 
vironment here is close to per- 
fect — no adverse factors, no de- 
fensive instincts necessary. And 
language, basically, is a survival 
device.” 

48 



H ANDS clasped behind his 
back, he paced in front of the 
assembled natives, pausing to 
scrutinize first an elderly woman, 
then the child who stood next to 
her. 

Abruptly, he turned to face the 
formation of ship’s personnel. 

“Hallman! Block off the area 
with neuro-repellent pickets. I’ll 
hold you responsible for the loss 
of any of these primitives. 

“Walker! Synthesize some 
clothing — halters and skirts for 
the women, loincloths for the 
men. That scrub over there looks 
as if it might do.” He flicked his 
hand toward a stand of dwarf 
trees. 

“Jenkins! Draw up a work 
schedule. I’ll expect you to get 
the most out of them at all times.” 
Hallman hurried off to charge 
the neurowave generators. 

Walker motioned to his crew 
and they followed him, lugging 
portable lab equipment over to 
the clump of miniature trees. 

Jenkins led his Herdsmen — 
the name they had earned in the 
Corps — back into the ship. 

Sharp continued on down the 
line of primitives, facing each 
with critical glances. He drew up 
in front of a young girl who fixed 
him with a stare as analytical as 
his own. 

She was tall and smoothly tan- 
ned, with blonde hair that bil- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



lowed like a surf against her 
shoulders. Her eyes were clear 
and vibrant, the slim lines of her 
body supple, yet strong without 
being muscular. Her face, despite 
its sharp lines and taut skin, was 
vital and beautiful. 

“She’ll do for a linguistic apti- 
tude test, Norton. Do what you 
can with her.” 

Solicitously, I took her by the 
arm and led her from the line. 
She came lithely and without re- 
sisting, an uncertain smile show- 
ing bewilderment, not a need for 
reassurance. 

Sharp backed off and surveyed 
the natives caustically. 

“Animals,” he muttered. “Sim- 
ple animals. They’ve never had 
anything to fight, no challenge to 
make them function as a social 
unit . therefore, no social de- 
velopment. But that should be to 
our advantage, shouldn’t it? If 
they’re like animals, they ought 
to respond to training like ani- 
mals.” 

He hooked his thumbs under 
his belt and laughed. “But they’ll 
be a credit to the Federation — 
after we teach them industry. 
They’ll hate work, but they’ll beg 
for it.” 

“Because,” I agreed wearily, 
“it’ll bring them the useless things 
they’ll learn to want.” 

But his thoughts were unbrok- 
en as he drummed a finger on his 



chin and glanced at me. “I won- 
der if they can grasp the concept 
of conflict.” 

Before I could answer, he 
rocked forward toward a husky 
youth and his hand lashed out, 
palm and knuckles stinging both 
cheeks in an alternate swing and 
backswing. 

Puzzled, the youth retreated, 
staring uncertainly at those 
around him. 

Sharp’s hand fell away from 
his sidearm. “Now that they know 
this isn’t going to be a party 
we’ll divide them into primar 
indoctrination groups, so we ca 
get an early start tomorrow.” 

A MAILED-FIST approach 
works admirably nine out of 
ten times on first contact with 
races of Class C intelligence and 
under — the Handbook says. 

The factors are simple: If 

you’re benign, they’ll be resentful 
when the delusion wears off and 
they learn of their responsibili- 
ties. On the other hand, if you 
show invincible might, they’ll be 
even more tractable when they 
realize their lot isn’t going to be 
enslavement but eventual equal- 
ity — of a purely commercial 
sort, of course. 

The Handbook was Sharp’s 
creed. If you made allowance for 
that — plus the not too conspicu- 
ous fact that he was bucking for 



COUNTRY ESTATE

the post of regional coordinator — 
then he really wasn’t such a bad 
character, as expedition com- 
manders go. 

To the unhardened crew mem- 
ber, slapping the native may have 
seemed malicious. It wasn’t real- 
ly. It was the mailed-fist tech- 
nique. I was familiar enough with 
Sharp to know there was nothing 
personal. Linguistic technicians, 
being second in command be- 
cause they also serve as liaison 
between natives and crew,- enjoy 
a somewhat closer relationship 
ith skippers. 

I was considering the conse- 
quences of the mailed-fist phil- 
osophy when Sharp came up and 
offered a cigarette. His face was 
grim and set even in the placid 
hues of sunset. 

Silently we smoked, while we 
watched the Herdsmen tagging 
the natives radiologically into 
four work groups. They finished 
with the last one and retired to 
the ship. The primitives disap- 
peared into the woods. 

“The girl?” Sharp asked. 

“She’s still under hypno from 
the first session.” 

“When will she be able to 
talk?” 

“Hard to say. A week — ten 
days. I’ve only handled articu- 
lates until now. I don’t know 
what the results will be with this 
batch.”

“How are you going about it?” 
“Double semacascade unit on 
slow transfer with all the trim- 
mings — hypnotic assimilation 
included. That way, the concepts 
and word symbols go directly in- 
to her subconscious. She doesn’t 
have to face the confusion of con- 
scious learning.” 

S HARP aimed his cigarette at 
a tree trunk. Sparks showered 
vividly in the twilight gloom. “Let 
me know when you’ve cascaded 
the full twenty - four - hundred - 
word basic. We may find their 
inarticulate status helpful to 
quick assimilation — don’t you 
suppose?” 

“A possibility,” I admitted. “At 
least they won’t have to struggle 
through the confusion of bilin- 
gual coordination.” 

A linguistic lab assistant led 
the girl from the ship. She stood 
looking at us momentarily, smiled 
and gracefully moved toward the 
woods. She was almost a silhou- 
ette against the pastels of faded 
sunset. But her pale features 
stood out as though in a light of 
their own. A flash of white and 
then she was engulfed by the 
darkness of the trees. 

For a long while, I stared after 
her. She and her people were 
lean and handsome, with the sup- 
ple limbs of swimmers or track- 
men. Strength and agility were 

GAtAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



apparent in every motion of their 
bodies. But it didn’t seem like 
the raw vigor of the primitive. 
Somehow they carried a sugges- 
tion of nobility. 

How would they be after civili- 
zation came? I had seen it 
happen so many times — the 
transitory degradation, the squal- 
id living conditions, the collective 
uncertainty and frustration — 
centuries before they would learn 
to live with civilization. 

“Something on your mind, Nor- 
ton?” Sharp asked suddenly. 

“Just this assignment — these 
people. Know what the men are 
calling them? Meekheads.” 

“You’re trying to say some- 
thing. Go on, say it.” 

“Maybe the mailed-fist doesn’t 
have to be applied.” 

He smiled, shaking his head. 
“Long ago, I tried that magnani- 
mous idea myself. About the sec- 
ond or third expedition. I got my 
ears pinned back with an upris- 
ing that I couldn’t begin to han- 
dle. I learned. You won’t catch 
Sharp having to call for the Bully 
Crew again.” 

* I ‘’HE DUTIES and responsi- 
bilities of the Corps are se- 
vere by any standards. Following 
in the wake of a Primary Discov- 
ery crew, we descend upon a 
planet, gather a test group, ad- 
minister a precursory indoctrina- 



tion in Federation civilization, 
then report on our success or fail- 
ure. If the report is favorable, we 
turn the planet over to a Com- 
prehensive Team which guides 
the expansion of the society in 
all phases from school system to 
technology. 

Our work is exacting. We are 
constantly under pressure of a 
deadline, for there’s no end to the 
planets that have to he tested 
and integrated. So we are always 
gratified to discover a previously 
overlooked aspect of primitive 
life — especially if it might make 
our job easier, less ruthless and 
more successful. 

That was why we were inter- 
ested in the dance, which we wit- 
nessed on our first night. 

Walker and I were accom- 
panying the skipper on security 
inspection outside the ship. The 
chemist was describing the primi- 
tives’ reaction to the issuance of 
clothing when we were attracted 
by a pale, glimmering light filter- 
ing through the trees. 

Sharp saw it first and pointed. 
“What do you make of that?” 

“Maybe Primary was wrong,” 
Walker suggested. “Maybe they 
do have fire.” 

“Then we’ll have to revise our 
appraisal.” Sharp surged ahead, 
smiling enthusiastically. “That’ll 
mean indoctrination in less time 
than we’d alloted.”

Farther into the thicket, the 
light became brighter, rivaling 
even the brilliance of the two 
moons and their shimmering re- 
flections against distant snow- 
topped peaks. 

Trying to push through a dense 
undergrowth, Sharp swore softly 
and jerked his arm back. 

“Damned thorns — like spikes!” 
He sucked on the back of his 
hand. 

A soft strain of melody rose 
from the other side of the brush, 
in the area of the trembling light. 

The subdued euphony in- 
creased in volume, like the swell 
of a restless sea — a hundred 
native voices in inarticulate har- 
mony, some murmuring huskily, 
others humming shrilly. The 
wordless song was all idyllic sim- 
plicity and sentiment. It was the 
pouring forth of the soul of a 
people. 

“God!” whispered Walker. 
“Ever hear anything like it?” 

Sharp grunted and moved on 
along the hedgelike bush to a 
spot where the growth was thin- 
ner. We drew up alongside him, 
staring into the clearing. 

'THE NATIVES were there — - 
some twenty or thirty in the 
center, surrounded by the others 
who sat in a circle. And the light 
— the shimmering glow that was 
like Earthbound starlight — was 

52 



coming from the bodies of the 
small group! 

It was an eerie blue-green aura 
that coruscated over their flesh 
like the phosphorescent glimmer- 
ings in a ship’s wake. 

Sharp grasped Walker’s arm. 
“Did Primary say anything about 
firefly natives?” he whispered in- 
credulously. 

“There’s nothing in the report,” 
the chemist assured him. 

“I’ll want a complete explana- 
tion. Take one of them back to 
the ship for observation. Put your 
best biochemist on it.” 

Gradually, while Sharp spoke, 
the wordless song had changed 
theme. To me, it was now a lilt- 
ing strain that dwelled on con- 
cepts of aspiration and yearning 
— the birth of resolution, the 
dawn of humility. And from the 
depths of the voices came a sub- 
tle undertone of pride. 

Then the dance began. 

Pressed tightly together, the 
small group slumped into an am- 
orphous cluster, the phosphores- 
cent sheen of their bodies disap- 
pearing. The murmured melody 
crescendoed while a single arm 
elevated and undulated, lambent 
light playing across its flesh like 
a cold fire. Other arms thrust up 
and joined in the wavering mo- 
tion, like reeds swaying before a 
marsh breeze. 

Faster now came the tempo of 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the music. Arms were elevated 
still higher and ghostily glimmer- 
ing bodies rose fluctuating be- 
neath them. The strain ended on 
a note of tentative triumph as 
the biological light flared bril- 
liantly . and was extinguished. 

But the humming resumed and 
the dancers, joined by others, re- 
grouped in three formations. 

Sharp touched my shoulder. 
“Look. They’ve formed a square, 
a triangle and a circle. A sub-so- 
cial group with no language, but 
with the knowledge of geometric 
symbols. Does that make sense?” 

“It’s possible. Symbols are tak- 
en from nature — the shape of 
their moons, the four pedal points 
of a quadruped, the outline of a 
mountain.” 

Fascinated by the new phase 
of the dance, we watched the na- 
tives in wild, erratic motion, their 
heads snapping rhythmically 
from side to side, their arms pis- 
toning in and out, their bodies 
whirling in discontinuous gyra- 
tions, each in turn duplicating the 
motion of the next one. It was a 
precise but discordant movement. 
It ended quickly, however, and 
the wraithlike spectacle passed 
on to still another phase. 

Now a tall native stood with 
arms folded and glowing steadily. 
A score of men and women cir- 
cled about him, pirouetting 
around each other in pairs. 



The background humming 
crested with excited fervor and 
the dancers whirled recklessly, 
their flesh only faintly luminous 
compared with that of the mo- 
tionless man. 

“Ron,” Sharp whispered eager- 
ly. “This proves they’re more 
communal than we thought. We 
might not have such a tough job 
ahead, after all.” 

A YOUNG girl, still whirling, 
glided away from her part- 
ner in an arc that swept her to 
the next nearest pair of circling 
dancers. The music became more 
excited now. Drawn as though in- 
to a vortex of exultation, another 
group formed at the other end of 
the field, spinning in mercurial 
steps about a second central fig- 
ure. 

The swirling motion was a 
thing of grace and beauty that 
could be described only in the 
dance that was being performed 
by primitives who had no lan- 
guage. 

The girl again swept out of 
position and, glowing even more 
brightly, caracoled across the 
clearing to become part of the 
second group. More spectators 
joined the gyrating formations. 
Others created new wheeling 
groups until there was none left 
to watch. 

Sharp swore abruptly and 



COUNTRY ESTATE 



53 



reached down to the ground. He 
came up waving a handful of gar- 
ments. We realized only then 
that the natives had cast off their 
synthetic clothing. 

Sharp’s expression grew harsh 
— the letter of the Handbook had 
been violated. The natives had 
been issued clothes and shown 
how to wear them, but they were 
not wearing them now. That was 
sheer disobedience. 

Shouting angrily, he charged 
into the clearing. 

The dancers froze in position. 
Their inarticulate tones drifted 
into silence. Their luminosity 
flickered, faded and disappeared, 
leaving the glade a dismal moor, 
illuminated only by the pitifully 
weak light of the moons. It was 
as though a beautiful symphony 
had been silenced in mid-theme. 

Sharp unholstered his duo-pur- 
pose revolver and flicked it on 
minimum output. Then he swept 
the closest group of dancers with 
its neuro-agitant impulses. 

He hurled the garments into 
the air and they fluttered down, 
falling across the bare flesh of 
the dancers. 

“Get them on!” he ordered, fan- 
ning the weapon back over the 
cringing primitives and then 
thrusting it into his holster. 

A small boy broke and raced 
blindly into the underbrush. I 
waited for the screams that would 




come as thorns tore into his flesh. 

Meekly — or was it with an 
imperceptible air of patience? — 
the primitives began putting on 
their clothes. 

Sharp returned to where we 
were standing. “Glad they step- 
ped out of line,” he explained. 
“The book says not to pass up 



54 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




any opportunity to show author- 
ity. Walker, pick one out for your 
bio test.” 

Then he started back for the 
ship. 

I went looking for the boy who 
had plunged into the thorny un- 
derbrush. 

I found him pressed against a 



tree. He didn’t shrink away, as I 
expected him to, when I knelt 
to examine his wounds. 

There weren’t any. 

r T , HE SEMACASCADE units 
hummed restlessly in the lab 
as I stood by the port and 
watched the natives working at 



COUNTRY ESTATE 



55 



the edge of the woods. 

An hour earlier, they had been 
shown a finished dwelling, con- 
structed of logs hewn and 
notched with nucleonic cutters 
and lifted into place with coun- 
ter-gravitic cranes. Now, coached 
by Herdsmen and equipped with 
the primitive tools they would be 
expected to use for two genera- 
tions, the four groups were at- 
tempting to duplicate the con- 
struction. 

The girl — we called her Lola 
for the record — stirred as the 
psychocascade pulsator changed 
pitch, moving on to another con- 
cept. I went over and readjusted 
the dipoles. Even in induced 
sleep, with her face relaxed and 
the color drained away, her beau- 
ty was like a vivid mask. But it 
was a helpless elegance that only 
seemed typical of the humility of 
her race — a new type of sub- 
dued charm unlike any I’d seen 
in any race, Class A through D 
inclusive. 

For a long while, I stared down 
at her delicate yet vigorous fea- 
tures, thinking thoughts forbid- 
den by the Handbook — how it 
would be to shake free of an ex- 
pedition and spend a lifetime 
with a nymph. 

Walker came in, frowning. 
“How’s Lola doing?” 

“Soaked up everything so far. 
Reaction about normal for a 

56 



Class C. How did the glow-worm 
biopsy go?” 

He shrugged wearily. “Can’t 
find anything to account for it. 
No dermato-trachael system. No 
oxygen supply for any sort of 
biocumbustion. No photogenic or- 
gans. Only normal human tissue.” 
“Don’t let it heave you,” I en- 
couraged. “Maybe it’s something 
we only imagined.” 

His frown only deepened. 
“Like that kid running into the 
thicket last night? Ron, the boy 
did tear through those thorns.” 

I laughed. “Without getting 
scratched?” 

He nodded seriously. “When I 
performed the biopsy, I took the 
specimen from the native’s shoul- 
der. I severed the tissue. I drop- 
ped it into solution. Not more 
than three seconds later, I was 
back to sterilize the wound . 
It had already healed.” 

CHARP LISTENED impa- 
^ tiently in his cabin as I told 
of the biopsy and the boy in the 
thicket. Then, annoyed, he shrug- 
ged it off. 

“Regeneration — simple re- 
generation. We’ve run across it 
before. There was that time on 
Auxol — ” 

“Not quite. This regeneration 
was in seconds, not days.” 

He stared thoughtfully out the 
port, then turned back to me. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Look, Ron. I’m not interested in 
physiological aberrations as long 
as they don’t disqualify a race as 
humanoid. In this body-glow mat- 
ter and regeneration — Walker 
hasn’t found anything to suggest 
the Meekheads are subhuman?” 

I shook my head. 

“Then the official report will 
do for whatever comments you 
or he might have on the phenom- 
ena. Meanwhile, I’m more con- 
cerned over this.” 

He motioned through the port 
toward the working natives. 
There were confused expressions 
on their faces as' they tried to lay 
base logs in place for the dwell- 
ings. 

“They are disappointingly in- 
ept for a race that is aware of 
geometrical patterns in their 
dance ritual,” he complained. 
“Does that suggest anything?” 
But he went on without waiting 
for a reply. “It’s obvious we have 
a conspiracy on our hands. They 
are capable of what we require, 
but they’re being obstinate.” 
“How can they conspire on 
anything without even a sign lan- 
guage?” I asked. 

“We’ll learn that only after we 
have the girl ready for her first 
interview. Then, perhaps, we’ll 
know why they glow like fireflies 
and heal their wounds immedi- 
ately.” 

“The explanation might lie in 



concepts we can’t grasp. How can 
they express those concepts in 
words we can understand, if we 
can’t give them a language with 
those words and concepts already 
embodied in it?” 

He brushed aside the argu- 
ment. “All the same, we will 
prepare for immediate linguistic 
contact. Have the girl ready for 
questioning in the morning.” 

“But we can’t speed it up that 
much without risking mental in- 
stability. Even top-grade Class Bs 
need at least a week for language 
indoctrination.” 

His features tightened stub- 
bornly. “Interview in the morn- 
ing. Early.” 

“But — ” 

“I’ll worry about the complica- 
tions, if there are any. The inter- 
view is an order, Ron.” 

After all, there was the Hand- 
book and he was bucking for pro- 
motion. Besides, he could stick 
anybody aboard with a summary 
charge of insubordination. And I 
did have my own future in the 
Corps to think about. 

As I turned to leave, a Herds- 
man supervisor clicked his heels 
in the doorway and saluted. “Sir, 
Lieutenant Hallman reports that 
the natives don’t eat.” 

“Tell the Lieutenant that if 
they don’t like our chow,” said 
Sharp, “let them grub for their 
own — between work periods.” 



COUNTRY ESTATE 



57 



“You don’t understand, Cap- 
tain. It isn’t that they won’t eat. 
They don’t eat — at all.” 

“Nonsense!” 

“We’ve just completed our 
third inspection of the area, sir. 
From what we can see, the Meek- 
heads never touch any food.” 

SOLICITOUSLY, I studied Lo- 
^ la as she lay beneath the cas- 
cade units, wondering whether 
she was aware of her helplessness 
and my inability to justify her 
confidence. 

My hand started toward the 
units to make the adjustments 
Sharp had ordered. But I drew 
them back hesitantly. Then I 
tried to capture the spirit of the 
Handbook, telling myself she was 
only one of a species; that if 
something went wrong with the 
language transplant experiment, 
there were still ninety-nine other 
subjects in the test area — mil- 
lions outside the area. 

But all I could see was her 
hair flared out on the cold metal 
of the table like solar promin- 
ences against the velvet of space; 
her smile that had expressed her 
simple faith in me more mean- 
ingfully than it could ever be con- 
veyed in words. 

Reluctantly, I increased the in- 
tensity of hypno-anesthetic and 
put the psychocascade units on 
three-quarters-maximum output, 

58 



direct transfer. Sharp would nev- 
er know I hadn’t used full power. 
And the only inconvenience to us 
would be a less than standard 
vocabulary, but one that would 
still do for an initial interview. 

Later, when night came, I wan- 
dered to the clearing, hoping to 
find the primitives again at their 
ritual. I wasn’t disappointed. 

Concealed behind a tree, I 
stared wonderingly at the magni- 
ficent spectacle of glimmering, 
whirling bodies, lost in the enig- 
ma of their ceremony. Only, this 
time, drab synthetic clothing con- 
cealed the full grace of their 
movements. And, as I watched, I 
wondered what the Federation’s 
most renowned choreographers 
would give just to witness the 
sight. 

Again the small group lay in 
a featureless mass with an occa- 
sional arm extending upward, 
wavering. 

Was it a symbolic ritual? An 
alternate social manifestation 
that supplanted a civilization 
which had never developed? Was 
it their legend and history, mores 
and folklore — all embodied in 
an exotic dance that replaced a 
language? If properly translated, 
would it resolve all the riddles? 

More confused than fascinat- 
ed, I watched the primitives exe- 
cute the erratic movements of 
snapping heads and pistoning 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



arms. And the music became even 
more soulful in transition to the 
next phase, while lithe bodies lost 
themselves in an ecstasy of con- 
centric circles around central fig- 
ures. 

Now the ritual was at the stage 
where it had been interrupted by 
Sharp. But it moved on into yet 
another phase. The groups dis- 
persed in flitting motion and the 
performers took up individual 
positions, spangling the glade 
with islands of pale light. 

The humming deepened to- 
ward a feverish pitch and move- 
ment resumed. The natives pirou- 
etted, caracoled, swayed, tripped 
across the field, while the halos 
of their bodies flickered steadily. 

They performed with an air of 
abandon, as though they realized 
that soon the ecstasy of their 
dance would be lost forever. And, 
for a brief instant, I could almost 
grasp an elusive meaning that 
might be concealed in their ritual. 

Suddenly one of the girls swept 
close by, an elegant flash of swift 
limbs and scintillating light. She 
paused to begin a pirouette and 
our eyes met. 

Was it Lola? 

But it couldn’t be! Even if she 
had overcome the hypo-anesthe- 
sia, she would still have the capa- 
citance-activated hatches to cope 
with before she could leave the 
ship. 



I scanned the field, trying to 
catch sight of her again. But she 
was gone — swallowed up in the 
maelstrom of dancers. 

Hurrying back to the ship, I 
found her as I had left her. 

MPATIENTLY, I swung aside 
the cascade units and moved 
the table away from the port so 
Lola’s face wouldn’t be in the 
direct sunlight. Then I waited for 
her to awaken, wondering appre- 
hensively whether the over- 
whelming surge of alien concepts 
and word symbols had destroyed 
an intelligence that might have 
been as gentle and beautiful as 
the form which cloaked it. 

But when she finally opened 
her eyes, the brightness of ration- 
ality was still there. 

“You are Lola,” I said. 

“But why am I here?” There 
was a softness in her voice that 
I hadn’t heard on a score of test 
planets — on a hundred civilized 
worlds. 

“You are going to speak for 
your people, until we can teach 
them to speak, too.” 

Her face twisted in confusion. 
“What is there to say?” 

“Through speaking, you will 
learn how to live better and be 
happy.” It was the routine ap- 
proach — Article Two, Section 
Seven, of the Handbook. 

“We are happy now.” 



COUNTRY ESTATE 



59 



“But you’ll be happier. We’re 
from the stars. And your chil- 
dren’s children will reach the 
stars, too.” 

She rose and stood trembling 
by the table. “You must go back 
without us.” 

I grasped her shoulders and 
stared into the beauty of her 
eyes. And I found myself strug- 
gling with thoughts the Hand- 
book says should be alien to any 
good Corpsman. 

“How do you know we can be 
civilized?” she asked. 

Sharp appeared smiling in the 
doorway, his thumbs hung up on 
his belt. “She can make sense?” 

I nodded as he strode over and 
stood before her. The mailed fist 
again? I wondered, tensing. 

“Do you people have a lan- 
guage?” he demanded. 

“We do not speak.” 

“But, you can talk,” he insisted. 
“You’re only pretending you 
can’t, aren’t you?” 

“Pretending?” she repeated. 

“The word’s not basic,” I re- 
minded him. 

“Neither is the word ‘civiliza- 
tion,’ which she seemed to be do- 
ing all right with when I came 
in.” 

I stared awkwardly at him, 
then at her. 

“Lola,” he continued warily, 
“your people are simple. They 
can’t even talk. Yet they know 

60 



all about a square, a circle, a tri- 
angle. How do you account for 
that?” 

She didn’t answer. 

“Do you know how to work 
together?” he pressed. 

“There is no need.” 

“Or did you decide you would- 
n’t work - — that you’d pretend to 
be stupid so we’d think you 
couldn’t learn to work?” 

“We are slow because the work 
is hard. We have never built 
homes before.” 

I interrupted. “You’re getting 
into concepts she can’t grasp with 
just a basic cascade treatment.” 

“The hell I am! She’s hedging, 
Ron! Yesterday she was out of 
the ship just once — when the 
others were taking a break. Yet 
she’s aware they’re being taught 
to build shacks. How else would 
she know unless they communi- 
cate?” 

He grasped her wrist. “What 
aie you trying to make us be- 
lieve?” 

She glanced helplessly at me. 
I started to step in between them. 

“Stay out, Norton,” Sharp 
warned. 

A Herdsman sergeant stomped 
in, saluted. “Lieutenant Walker 
wants to know if you’ll come to 
the lab right away, sir.” 

“What now?” Sharp asked, an- 
noyed. 

“We found out why they don’t 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



have to wear clothes. The Lieu- 
tenant says they’re thermostatic. 
They can adjust to cold or heat.” 

Sharp’s arms flopped down. 
“Damn!” he muttered, striding 
for the hatch. 

In the corridor, he glanced 
back. “Lock that woman up, Ser- 
geant, until I can get back to her.” 

Somehow I felt Lola might not 
stay locked up very long. 

r T , HE SEMACASCADE banks 
had to be bled and recharged, 
so it wasn’t until late afternoon 
before I could get away from the 
lab. 

Outside, I watched from a dis- 
tance as Sharp personally super- 
vised the primitives’ instructions 
in tree-felling and notching. But 
they couldn’t seem to grasp the 
principle of fitting one log on top 
of the other. 

I rehearsed an argument for 
Lola’s release — one that I felt 
would be convincing — and wait- 
ed for a chance to spring it. 

Sharp was a fury of bellowing 
words as he shouted instructions 
to the Herdsmen and contempt 
for the natives. I watched him 
snatch an ax from one of the 
primitives and swing it savagely 
at the trunk of a sapling. Swear- 
ing, he thrust it back into the 
man’s hand. The native only con- 
tinued to wield the tool ineffec- 
tively, the broadside of its blade 



clanking against bark. 

“Jenkins!” Sharp shouted 
abruptly. “Take a two-hour break 
and reorganize into shifts. We’re 
going on a twenty-four-hour 
schedule.” 

Swabbing his brow, he came 
over and held out a cigarette, 
shaking his head disparagingly. 
“I’ve never run into this much 
trouble.” 

“About Lola — ” I began. 

He thrust a lighter under my 
cigarette and then lit his own. 
“I’m ordering a trouble-shooting 
detail from Regional Command. 
Microbiologists, organic chemists, 
psychologists, medical technicians 
— a full complement. We’ll find 
out more about these damned 
Meekheads than we know about 
ourselves!” 

He probably had visions of his 
promotion to regional coordina- 
tor flying out of orbit. 

“John,” I said, “these natives 
are — well, different. Maybe an- 
other approach — ” 

“Like turning the girl loose,” 
he broke in sarcastically, “and 
patting her on the rump and ask- 
ing her family in to sit at the 
captain’s table?” 

“If you’d quit 'quoting the 
Handbook for a minute — ” 

“This is my ship,” he returned 
severely, “and I want it taut. So 
taut that whenever I find a sub- 
ordinate going moon-happy over

a native woman — ” 

He stopped short and let out 
a rush of air like a ship blowing 
its tubes. “Oh, hell, Ron. You’re 
a good linguistic technician. Don’t 
complicate things.” 

“I can’t see putting a girl in 
irons because Article Three says 
to watch out for conspiracy.” 

He sighed. “You don’t like the 
Corps, do you?” 

“I don’t like the way it’s run 
sometimes.” 

Even before I said it, I realized 
I had needled him too far. 

He hurled his cigarette to the 
ground and crushed it. “Well, you 
can walk out and go native any 
time — now, if you want!” 

He strode angrily toward the 
ship and my eyes followed him 
as my thoughts stalled on his last 
words. And I wondered how 
many desertions from the Corps 
were prompted by Handbook- 
conscious skippers, how many by 
Galaxy-hopping fatigue . how 
many by girls like Lola. 

I N THE dusk, the natives stood 
around the half-built cabin, 
staring uncertainly after the 
Herdsmen who were withdrawing 
into the ship. 

Studying the people, I realized 
they didn’t look like persons who 
had been driven almost to ex- 
haustion for ten hours. Their 
bodies were unbent, their faces 



alert and fresh, and their move- 
ments brisk as they sifted into 
the thicket ... to another dance 
ritual? 

Stars came out glittering and 
brilliant against the soft curtain 
of night, like . like the final 
phase of the primitives’ dance! I 
made the association spontane- 
ously, as though I had subcon- 
sciously realized it all the while. 

At the beginning of that final 
movement, they had spaced 
themselves randomly about the 
field, their luminescence trembl- 
ing in intensity like the shimmer- 
ings of a myriad stars. 

Was this part of the symbol- 
ism? Was I beginning to grasp 
the significance of the ritual? 

I pushed quickly through the 
woods to the clearing. The dance 
was already under way and, in- 
tently, I watched the formless 
mass of bodies writhing, waver- 
ing, striving to stand erect, sway- 
ing rhythmically. 

It was like — like ... I 
couldn’t force the association. I 
listened to the strains of hum- 
med music for a possible clue. 
But still I was seeing only an in- 
comprehensible group dance. 

The pace quickened and the 
primitives swirled into rigid posi- 
tions, their bodies moving in the 
precise rhythm of the second, the 
mechanical phase. Then I noticed 
they had discarded their clothes. 



62 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



There was movement in the 
bush on my right and Lola 
emerged, running lithely toward 
the clearing! She passed close and 
I grabbed her arm. 

“How did you get out of the 
ship?” I snapped. 

Moonlight splashed across her 
face and, for the first time, there 
was anxiety in her features. 

“Let me go!” she pleaded. “It 
will be our last dance!” 

Perplexed, I stared down at 
her. How had she learned about 
the twenty-four-hour work sched- 
ule? 

“We are going away,” she ex- 
plained. 

My hand closed suddenly on 
nothing, where before it had 
held her wrist. And she was 
among the dancers. She took her 
place in a concentric circle whirl- 
ing about one of the glowing 
pivot men. 

Their humming voices, the 
fierce abandon, were soul-stirring 
and vividly alive. 

Entranced, I stood swaying at 
the edge of the clearing, wanting 
to race out and join them, eager 
to experience their exultation. 

Lola glided from her circle and 
tripped across the clearing to 
take up a new whirling position 
with another group. Two natives 
from that group flitted to the 
formation she had left. 

Suddenly there was a burst of 



realization as the pattern re- 
solved into meaningful terms. 
Now I knew! The dance and its 
phases were — 

“Lola!” I cried, remembering 
she had said they were going 
away. “Don’t leave!” 

Sickened with a sense of im- 
pending loss, I strained to catch 
sight of her. They couldn’t leave 
now — not after we’d just found 
them! 

Finally I saw her, a lovely 
wraith, all shimmering and beau- 
tiful as she danced the dance of 
a hundred eras. I lunged out after 
her. 

“Steady, Norton. Stand back.” 

I stopped and turned around, 
riveted by the threat in Sharp’s 
voice. Cold moonlight shivered 
along the metal barrel of the gun 
he held. 

4»T COULD overlook our dif- 
ferences of opinion,” he said 
calmly, scanning the formations 
of dancers. “But freeing the girl, 
standing by and letting these 
primitives run around nude . 
Where is she?” 

“You don’t understand. These 
natives — ” 

“Save it for the court-martial. 
Meanwhile, you’ll confine your- 
self to quarters under arrest.” He 
motioned me to one side and 
leveled the gun into the clearing. 

Punishment — the whiplash of 



COUNTRY ESTATE 



63 



neuro-agitant impulses — was 
sufficient for a first offense, the 
Handbook directed. For a repeat- 
ed offense, such as flagrant nud- 
ity, an exemplary execution was 
mandatory. 

He flicked the weapon’s selec- 
tor to maximum output and a 
nimbus of vicious, visible force 
leaped out to engulf the nearest 
native. Radiant energy supple- 
mented the effect of body illu- 
mination until a dazzling light 
flared briefly, like the bursting of 
a nova. 

When the fierce glow subsided, 
however, there was no limp body 
quivering in the final agonies of 



a death that had destroyed the 
nervous system. 

The native had simply disap- 
peared. 

And the dance continued as 
though the performers hadn’t no- 
ticed the incident. 

The gun dangling from his 
hand, Sharp backed away incred- 
ulously. He brought the weapon 
up again and its soft fury of pale 
light flicked out once more, this 
time directed at two of the primi- 
tives. 

I struggled with the impression 
that the pair had disappeared the 
barest instant before he fired. 

Sharp swore. 




64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




And the dance went on, reach- 
ing its climax. The primitives dis- 
persed about the field, filling the 
glade with the weird lambent il- 
lumination of their bodies. 

I remembered Lola, desperate- 
ly shouted her name, lunged 
again into the clearing. 

The thin cone of deadly neuro- 
impulses flared like a barrier 
inches in front of me, aimed at 
the natives on the far right. Then 
the beam was sweeping slowly, 
determinedly, across the glade. 

Like candles being extin- 
guished with the wave of a hand, 
the primitives disappeared in 
turn as the spotlight of death 




passed over them. 

Then they were all gone and 
Sharp was shouting to himself. 
He let the gun fall to the ground 
and dropped down beside it, his 
face in his hands. I felt sorry for 
him. He didn’t understand. 

When he looked up, the harsh- 
ness was back on his face. “They 
won’t get far! Not with the neuro- 
picket fence up.” 

“Have you a fence around the 
Galaxy?” I asked, suddenly bit- 
ter. 

He stared bewilderedly. 

“They won’t be back,” I went 
on dully. “They were considering 
leaving all the while. They pulled 
out when they saw we meant to 
break down their ruse and bring 
them the gift of civilization.” 

TT WAS lonely in the clearing 
with the natives gone. There 
was only the hollow memory of 
their dance, the ringing strains of 
their melody in every rustling 
leaf. I knew it was a desolation 
that extended all over the planet. 

“You know where they went?” 
he asked incredulously. 

I turned vengefully on him. 
But resentment gave way to pity 
and I looked away. He could 
never understand. The factors 
were too far removed from hand- 
books and creeds and taut ships 
and the politics of the Corps. For- 
lornly, I closed my eyes and pic-

tured Lola’s face — a face I 
would never see again. 

“Where are they, Ron?” he de- 
manded. 

“A light-year away — ten — 
a thousand. Maybe in another 
galaxy.” 

He swore impatiently. 

“We were trying to judge their 
intelligence.” I couldn’t control 
the irony in my voice. “That was 
like a moron trying to appraise 
the intelligence of a genius . 
John, we are the primitives! 
We’re like a wild dog who finds 
himself on the grounds of a peace- 
ful country estate. Instead of let- 
ting himself be taken in and hav- 
ing it easy for the rest of his life, 
he stays vicious and gets kicked 
back into the forest. God, what 
we might have learned from 
them!” 

“From those savages?” 

“They were savages, all right 
— fifty million years ago maybe. 
Think of their dance. Could you 
see anything in it?” 

“Just a primitive ritual.” 

“It was a total record of racial 
achievement, passed down from 
generation to generation — a 
ceremonial tribute to a glorious 
heritage.” 

“Heritage! In a race that hasn’t 
even learned to build a fire?” 

“Their discovery of fire,” I ex- 
plained patiently, “was commem- 
orated in the first phase of the 

66 



dance — wavering luminous 
arms and bodies rising like flames 
from a formless heap. It symbol- 
ized the beginning of culture. The 
erratic gestures of the second 
movement — I could see spin- 
ning gears, thrusting rods, sliding 
pistons ... a tribute to a transi- 
tory mechanical civilization. 

“And dancers whirling in cir- 
cles around their luminous pivot 
men? Planets in orbits around 
suns. Natives gliding from one 
circling position — from one or- 
bit — to another. A commemora- 
tion of the conquest of interplan- 
etary space.” 

Comprehension was spreading 
across his face. “And when they 
were scattering around the field 
with their bodies glowing on and 
off — -” 

“Twinkling stars. And natives 
darting from one dancer to an- 
other to signify the achievement 
of galactic travel.” 

“ But where is their civiliza- 
tion?” 

1 TURNED to stare morosely 
into the clearing. She had 
danced there only minutes ago. 
The loneliness now made it seem 
like an eternity. 

“What is civilization?” I asked. 
“Simply a stage in racial evolu- 
tion. From our viewpoint, be- 
cause we are immediately in- 
volved in the process, civilization 
* 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



seems an end in itself. We’re 
proud of the artifacts we’ve per- 
fected. But when we evolve to 
the point where we can turn body 
heat on and off like a switch, 
why waste time tailoring clothes 
and building homes? And would 
it not be pointless to take medi- 
cines and maintain therapeutic 
institutions if we had already de- 
veloped spontaneous regenera- 
tion? 

“Would we bother with produc- 
ing food, if we had evolved a bio- 
logical way of extracting energy 
for metabolism from some source 
we can’t even conceive of now? 
Nor would we need interstellar 
and interplanetary ships — or 
any kind of vehicle — if we could 
go anywhere simply by willing 
ourselves there. Even language is 
superfluous when there’s the abil- 
ity to transfer concepts directly 
from mind to mind. And any 
planet they pick is not a world 
to be conquered. It’s a country 
estate.” 

Sharp broke his thoughtful si- 
lence with a start. “Ron, we’ve 
got to find them! Think what the 
contact would mean, to the ad- 
vancement of galactic civiliza- 
tion! This can’t be the only planet 
they were on. When they left 
civilization behind, they must 
have scattered. We’ll hunt them 
down, if we have to search the 
Galaxy system by system!” 

tv 



And you’ll still not find us. 
The words seemed like my own 
— unspoken. 

Sharp gasped and I knew he 
had heard the same silent voice. 
Spinning around, he faced the 
clearing. 

“Lola!” he cried. 

She stood there, arms folded, 
her head thrown back in pro- 
found dignity and goddesslike 
loveliness. 

“You have guessed well,” she 
said softly. “Don’t waste your 
time searching for something 
you’ll never find. Your racial ex- 
istence spans a few thousand 
years. Until it can be measured 
in tens of millions of years, there 
can be no intellectual contact 
between your civilization and our 
culture. There is no common 
basis.” 

She smiled and it was obvious-? 
ly a gesture of farewell. 

“Wait!” Sharp stumbled for- 
ward. “You can’t desert us! We 
— we’re like you!” 

She threw her head back and 
laughed silently. 

“Lola,” I whispered urgently, 
“take me with you!” 

“To the — country estate?” 

Then she smiled warmly and 
extended her hand. 

“Come,” she said. 

And we went — alone — to- 
gether.

I CAN’T make up my mind 
whether I should begin by 
telling you what you might 
be able to see this summer after 
a rainstorm has finally ended a 
dry spell or whether I should be 
more systematic and first pin 
down what it is I am going to talk 
about. Maybe the latter will be 
the better way because, after 
finding out what I am going to 
discuss, you may decide that you 
won’t have to investigate rain

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





Zoologists, you may know, di- 
vide all living things that are not 
vegetables into a number of 
major groups which they call 
phyla. Everything that has a 
backbone makes such a phylum, 
for example; all mollusks make 
a phylum and all one-celled ani- 
mals make a phylum. One of 
these phyla bears the name of 
arthropoda. 

The next smaller sub-division 
inside a phylum is the “class” and 
what kind of animals compose 
the phylum arthropoda will be- 
come clear quickly if I mention 
a few of the classes comprising 
it. 

The insects are one of these 
classes and the arachnids (spiders 
and their relatives) are another 
one. The centipedes form another 
class and the crustaceans still 
another. 

TNSIDE a class, you have sub- 

classes. In the case of the 
crustaceans, there are two which, 
by sheer coincidence, might be 
described as small crustaceans 
and large crustaceans; actually it 
is the presence or absence of ab- 
dominal appendages that counts. 
The ones without also happen to 
* be minute, tiny or small in size 
and this subclass is called Ento- 
mostraca. 

Inside the subclasses, you have 
“orders” and the one that inter- 
ests us here is the order of the 



Branchiopoda which, if you insist 
on a translation, means “the gill- 
footed ones.” 

Inside the orders, you have 
sub-orders and the one I have in 
mind is called the sub-order of 
the Phyllopoda ( phyllodes is 
Greek for “leaf like”) and inside 
the sub-order you have, in this 
case, “divisions,” of which the 
first is, at least, something fish 
fanciers among my readers should 
know by name — the division of 
the fairy shrimps. The division, 
in turn, is composed of “families” 
— the families of genera and the 
genera of species. The family is 
that of the Apopidae and the two 
families are Lepidurus and Apus. 

It is Apus I want to tell about. 

In appearance, it can best be 
compared to the well-known 
horseshoe crab of eastern North 
America. If you imagine a small 
horseshoe crab with a carapace 
about an inch in length, you also 
have a picture of the proper size. 
But Apus is much prettier. 




Apus cancriformis, a crustacean in good 
standing but of irresponsible habits 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



69 



Like all the so-called fairy- 
shrimps, it has a strong tendency 
to be transparent, but it runs to 
definite colors in spite of that. 
The wide, flat carapace is some- 
where between amber yellow and 
pale gold, the body is reddish, the 
legs brownish and the tail is red. 
It is bigger than most of the 
other fairy shrimps and the re- 
sult is that the other fairy 
shrimps constitute its food. 

Apus cannot be called rare, for 
when it occurs, there are hun- 
dreds of them in any large pud- 
dle over an area of square miles. 
But one can never predict 
whether it will occur or not. In 
England it was observed, for 
example, in 1850. The next occur- 
rence there — southern Scotland, 
to be precise — took place in 
1907. And it hasn’t been reported 
from Great Britain since. 

It is because of these ultra- 
sporadic occurrences that many 
a naturalist who knows all about 
Apus has never seen one in the 
open. You can’t go and look for 
Apus, or rather you can look, as 
I said before, when a rainstorm 
has ended a summer dry spell, 
but whether you find one is a 
case of rare luck. 

C ONSIDERING its habit of 
“rare abundance,” Apus must 
have made its existence known 
quite some time ago, but it did 
not get into print until around 



1725. A gentleman by the name 
of Johann Leonhard Frisch then 
published a series of quarto 
volumes under the general title 
of Description of manyfold In- 
sects and in one of these volumes 
Apus appeared — with the name 
that is still in use. 

Translated, the word Apus 
means “footless,” which sounds 
slightly unbelievable when you 
look at the picture. But Frisch 
had a reason — he did not con- 
sider the many appendages of 
the Apus as feet. He was some- 
what vague as to what they were, 
but he was sure that they were 
not feet and coined the name 
accordingly. 

The next man to deal with 
Apus was the “pastor of the evan- 
gelical congregation of Regens- 
burg,” Johann Christian Schaffer, 
who successfully devoted his time 
between sermons to zoological 
problems. He declared in 1756 
that the Apus was not a “water 
insect” as Frisch had said, nor an 
aquatic centipede as somebody 
else had guessed, but a relative 
of the crayfish, the lobster and 
the crab. Shaffer also found the 
eggs of the Apus and observed 
that they could be dried and kept 
dry for years, but that they 
hatched when the soil containing 
them was thrown into a container 
with water. He thereby explained 
how Apus could occur in a given 
place a few days after a storm. 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He also stated that a wind 
might pick up the dry eggs with 
dust and blow it to a place where 
Apus had not occurred for a long 
time. But then Schaffer found 
that he had researched himself 
into a corner from which he did 
not know how to escape. 

He had carefully examined a 
large number of specimens and 
found that they all had eggs and 
thus were all females! He col- 
lected the eggs and let them 
hatch later. Another generation, 
every one of them a female! They 
laid eggs and Schaffer collected 
them. 

This time he let each egg 
hatch in its separate container. 

“I succeeded,” he reported, “in 
that some of them grew up and 
I obtained eggs from them and 
young from these eggs. This was 
enough proof for me that they 
can produce and discharge fertile 
eggs without fertilization.” 

But after he had written down 
what his own observations had 
made clear, he found that he had 
observed something impossible 
— you could have eggs without 
a male around, but you could 
not have fertile eggs. 

We now know that some arth- 
ropods can do just that, that un- 
fertilized eggs will hatch into 
more females and that fertiliza- 
tion is the classical conditio sine 
qua non only if more males are 
to be produced. 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



Schaffer did not know this and 
the only way he could reconcile 
his observations and his convic- 
tions was to assume that the fe- 
males he had examined were in 
reality hermaphrodites with both 
male and female sex glands. It 
wasn’t so, but if Schaffer hadn’t 
found this excuse, he would never 
have slept soundly again — un- 
less, of course, he had gone on to 
become the discoverer of par- 
thenogenesis. 

13Y ONE .of these accidents of 
which the history of science 
is rich, the male Apus was dis- 
covered precisely one century 
after old Schaffer had published 
his observations. The discoverer 
was the Polish zoologist Kuzo- 
bowsky, the place of the discov- 
ery a puddle near Crakow. Be- 
tween these two dates there were 
two occurrences of Apus which 
did not influence its investiga- 
tion and did not increase the 
store of knowledge, but which 
are worth mentioning. 

It was during the Napoleonic 
wars, in 1806, that Johann Wolf- 
gang von Goethe, poet, statesman 
and amateur scientist, received a 
speciment of Apus. He was in- 
tensely interested and since busi- 
ness of all kinds did not permit 
him to hunt for Apus himself, he 
enlisted the aid of whoever was 
willing to do it for him. He 
offered a whole Thaler for an- 

71 



other specimen, a guilder for the 
specimen after that and decreas- 
ing prizes for more, ending up 
with a minimum of six pfennigs. 

The inhabitants of Jena shook 
their heads, but many of them 
could use a Thaler and went look- 
ing. Without success, though, for 
Goethe never got to see a second 
Apus. 

In Vienna, on the other hand, 
the circumstances were reversed. 
During the night from the 12th 
to the 13th of August, 1821, a 
rainstorm of fantastic magnitude 
and intensity burst over Vienna 
and vicinity. It was so powerful 
that all gutters were flooded and 
stayed flooded for weeks. Apus 
appeared in enormous numbers 
in these puddles and the women 
who always sold fish tried to sell 
Apus, too — but without finding 
any takers. 

After Kuzobowsky had report- 
ed that the male Apus existed 
and could be found on occasion, 
the scene shifted once more, this 
time to Franconia, where Apus 
had put in an appearance for 
several years running, which in 
itself is a minor miracle. 

The zoologist Karl Theodor 
Ernst von Siebold decided to find 
out once and for all whether the 
males, now known to exist, were 
needed for continuation of the 
species. He found what already 
had been mentioned, namely that 
fertilization was required for 

72 



male offspring but not necessary 
for female offspring. The books 
now say that von Siebold was 
the rediscoverer of parthenogene- 
sis, which is the technical term 
for this phenomenon. He is called 
rediscoverer because it was later 
established that other zoologists 
had preceded him, though with- 
out finding any acceptance. 

S INCE I had to compare Apus 
with the horseshoe crab as re- 
gards appearance, it is necessary 
to say a few words about this by 
no means rare inhabitant of the 
shallow waters of the Atlantic 
coast of the North American con- 
tinent and of the shallow waters 
around the Spice Islands. 




Limulus polyphemus, the horseshoe crab, 
which looks quite similar but is 
an arachnid 



Among zoologists, the horse- 
shoe crab, Limulus, had two dis- 
tinctions for a long time. One was 
that it was the strangest living 
crab, the other that it was a “liv- 
ing fossil,” for horseshoe crabs 
were known from deposits 200 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



million years ago. That latter dis- 
tinction still holds true, but scien- 
tists now know that the horseshoe 
crab is not a crab at all. It is still 
an arthropod, of course, but it 
belongs to the class of the arach- 
nids. Of course you are at liberty 
to call it the strangest living 
arachnid. 

As regards age, the horseshoe 
crab has recently received heavy 
competition from a relative of 
Apus. (I wish the specialists 
would get together on the names 
they use. In Europe, they now 
call their own Apus Lepidurus 
apus.) 

O 




Triops cancriformis, which has not changed 
for the last 200 million years 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



The name of the relative is 
Triops cancriformis, which looks 
rather like Apus, but seems to be 
slightly larger. Habits of occur- 
rence are the same. The reason 
for mentioning it is that it has 
recently been found in the fossil 
state, in deposits from the young- 
est of the three subdivisions of 
the Triassic period, the so-called 
Keuper, of an age of very nearly 
200 million years. 

The only distinction between 
the living and the fossil form that 
could be found at all is a slight 
difference in size, the fossil form 
being the smaller one. But this 
could be an individual difference. 
It looks as if not only the “family” 
but the genus and probably even 
the species have not changed at 
all since the end of the Triassic 
period. 

THE MOUNTAIN BOOMER 

r I 'HE ITEM on the Mountain 
Boomer of western Texas 
and vicinity has brought in a 
good deal of correspondence, 
some of it contradictory but all 
of it interesting. 

Several readers living in Texas, 
Arizona and New Mexico wrote 
to say that they are well 
acquainted with their native rep- 
tiles, that they know some of 
them occasionally dash about 
running on their hind legs, but 
that they had never heard the 

73 




Western collared lizard. 

term Mountain Boomer. 

A lady in New Mexico, on the 
other hand, did not claim to know 
much about reptiles, but knew 
that in some sections of Arizona 
the Gila Monster was called 
Mountain Boomer. There must 
have been some confusion some- 
where, probably caused by the 
fact that the Mountain Boomer 
is thought to be poisonous and 
that the Gila Monster is known 
to be. 

Finally, I have the promise of 
one reader in Texas to “go after 
it” this summer with notebook 
and camera. 

A letter from Dr. Charles M. 
Bogert, chairman of the Depart- 
ment of Amphibians and Rep- 
tiles at the American Museum of 
Natural History, informed me 
that the term Mountain Boomer 
is mentioned in Dr. Leonard 
Stejneger’s works as a synonym 
of the collared lizard, Crotaphyl- 
lus collaris, which ranges from 
Oregon to Mexico. Dr. Bogert 
explained that the collared lizard 
varies in color in various parts of 
their range, but that they are 

74 



greenish in the plateau region of 
western Texas to western Ari- 
zona. 

“In fact, the only thing wrong 
with Mr. Crutcher’s description 
is the size,” he wrote. “Collared 
lizards attain a maximum size of 
approximately 13 inches, and 
three feet was a bit of an exag- 
geration — the sort of thing that 
happens when a story is retold 
many years afterward.” 

I then checked with the Hand- 
book of Lizards by Hobart M. 
Smith. It does not list Mountain 
Boomer as a synonym in the in- 
dex or elsewhere, but it does have 
a good deal to say about the 
western collared lizard, Crota- 
phytus collaris baileyi, named by 
Stejneger. The overall length is 
about 13 inches, two-thirds of 
which are tail. Under the head- 
ing of Habits, it says: “If startled 
on flat ground where they can 
reach high speed in movement, 
they use only the hind legs, lift- 
ing the whole forepart of the 
body and the forelegs completely 
off the ground. Running in such 
a curious pose, they look like 
diminutive racing dinosaurs, wad- 
dling slightly as they rush along.” 
.Of course they are not poison- 
ous, although they are rather 
willing to bite on whatever they 
consider provocation. What I 
would still like to know, however, 
is why they were ever called 
Mountain Boomer and what is

behind the story of the “whining” 
lizard that was told more than 
half a century ago. 

THE NAMES OF THE ELEMENTS 

A READER in Brooklyn wrote 
me a letter a while back say- 
ing that, while looking through 
an older chemistry text, he had 
come across names of elements 
that did not agree with those with 
which he was familiar and asked 
me to tell him the names cur- 
rently in use. I could not reply in 
the usual letter column because 
the answer would have been too 
long. But I am going to use the 
balance of this space for this 
topic now because I know that 
other people have been confused, 
too. Unless you know the history 
involved,- it must be disconcert- 
ing to have tungsten suddenly 
appear under the name of wol- 
fram, for example. 

Most of the changes involve 
the two ends of the atomic scale 
because of the activities of the 
atomic energy experts. At the top 
of the scale, they merely added 
elements; at the bottom, they 
violated custom by doing some- 
thing chemists do not consider 
“permissible” — they have given 
separate names to isotopes of the 
same element. 

Element No. 1, hydrogen, is 
still called that if its atomic 
weight is “one” (approximately, 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



that is), but double-weight or 
“heavy” hydrogen is deuterium, 
while triple-weight hydrogen is 
tritium. But element No. 2, 
helium, also has an isotope of 
about three units weight; this is 
called tralphium, though normal 
helium, of about four units 
weight, is still helium — unless 
you refer to its nucleus only, 
which is an “alpha particle.” 

Above helium, the sailing is 
clear for a while: No. 3, lithium; 
No. 4, beryllium; No. 5, boron; 
No. 6, carbon; No. 7, nitrogen; 
No. 8, oxygen; No. 9, fluorine and 
No. 10, neon. 

When you come to No. 11, 
sodium, you may encounter a 
“hemispheric difference” in the 
naming; in Europe, it’s usually 
natrium and its chemical symbol 
is Na. 

Then there are again no prob- 
lems for a while: No. 12, mag- 
nesium; No. 13, aluminum (alu- 
minium in England, France and 
Germany); No. 14, silicon; No. 
15, phosphorus; No. 16, sulfur; 
No. 17, chlorine; No. 18, argon. 

With No. 19, potassium, an- 
other hemispheric difference 
crops up — its symbol is K and 
non-English speaking chemists 
call it kalium, since the name is 
derived from the Arab al kaljun, 
meaning wood ash. 

Again there is clear sailing for 
a while: No. 20, calcium; No. 21, 
scandium; No. 22, titanium; No. 

75 



23, vanadium; No. 24, chromium; 
No. 25, manganese; No. 26, iron; 
No. 27, cobalt; No. 28, nickel; 
No. 29, copper; No. 30, zinc; No. 
31, gallium; No. 32, germanium; 
No. 33, arsenic; No. 34, selenium; 
No. 35, bromine; No. 36, krypton; 
No. 37, rubidium; No. 38, stron- 
tium; No. 39, yttrium and No. 
40, zirconium. - 

T HERE was a change a num- 
ber of years ago with regard 
to No. 41, which used to be called 
columbium by American chemists 
while everybody else called it 
niobium. The chemical symbol 
was Nb anywhere and now the 
name niobium is official every- 
where. No. 42 never gave any 
trouble; it was always molyb- 
denum, though the name might 
confuse a classical philologist, for 
molybdos is Greek for “lead.” No. 
43 was first called masurium after 
an area in East Prussia, presum- 
ably the home of one of its first 
discoverers. But it is now inter- 
nationally technetium with the 
symbolic Tc. 

No linguistic problems for the 
next dozen or so: No. 44, ruth- 
enium; No. 45, rhodium; No. 46, 
palladium; No. 47, silver (that 
the symbol of No. 47 is Ag is due 
to the Latin word for that metal: 
argentum')-, No. 48, cadmium; 
No. 49, indium; No. 50, tin (the 
symbol Sn is based on the Latin 
word for tin, stannum); No. 51, 



antimony (symbol is Sb from 
Latin name stibium); No. 52, 
tellurium; No. 53, iodine; No. 54, 
xenon; No. 55, caesium and No. 
56, barium. 

But now we get into turbulent 
waters, for we have arrived at the 
group called the rare earth 
metals. I have just looked at half 
a dozen popular books on chem- 
istry and found that some authors 
believe in simplifying their own 
life rather than that of the reader 
when they come to the rare 
earths. Some simply wrote in 
their tables: “Nos. 51-71, rare 
earths” and two just said “Nos. 
51-71.” So I had better give the 
list first, beginning with the 
atomic number, followed by the 
chemical symbol, then the atomic 
weight (latest information I have, 
which may not be late enough) 
and finally the name:

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



T N OLDER books, you may 
find a “didymium” listed, 
which was just based on insuffi- 
cient knowledge. Carl, Count 
Auer von Welsbach, the Austrian 
chemist, established that there 
were two elements he named 
praseodymium (“green twin”) 
and neodymium (“new twin”). 
The word didymium meant 
“twin,” too; it was supposed to be 
the “twin of lanthanum.” 

No. 61 was called “illinium” 
(from Illinois) at first; the defi- 
nite identification and the name 
prometheum originated at Oak 
Ridge. Nos. 70 and 71 were dis- 
covered independently and near- 
ly simultaneously by Auer von 
Welsbach of Austria and Georges 
Urbain of France. The names 
proposed by Auer von Welsbach 
(but not accepted) were aide- 
bar aniurn for No. 70 and cassi- 
opeium for No. 71. The now 
accepted names are both based 
on place names, Ytterby in Swe- 
den and Lutetia, the original 
Latin name of Paris. 

The next element above the 
rare earths is No. 72, hafnium. 
There never was any trouble 
with the name; the amusing thing 
is that it was coined by a Hun- 
garian (Georg von Hevesy) who 
was then working in Copenhagen, 
which is Kjobenhavn in Danish 
— at least most of the time, since 
they use two forms. 

Now again things will go 



smoothly for a while: No. 73, 
tantalum; No. 74 — sorry, I 
talked too soon — No. 74 is the 
element with the symbol W, 
standing for wolfram, formerly 
known by its Swedish name of 
tungsten, now officially abolished. 
Then No. 75, rhenium (from 
Latin Rhenus, the Rhine); No. 
76, osmium; No. 77, iridium; No. 
78, platinum; No. 79, gold (the 
symbol Au is from the Latin 
name aurum ); No. 80, mercury 
(symbol Hg from its old name 
Hydrargium ); No. 81, thallium; 
No. 82, lead (symbol Pb is from

Latin name plumbum ); No. 83, 
bismuth; No. 84, polonium. 

No. 85 was called alabamine 
(from Alabama) for some time, 
but the name is now astatine 
(from the Greek astasia, mean- 
ing “unsteady”) and the symbol 
At, the reason being that of all 
of its isotopes known, the “long- 
est-lived” has a half-life of about 
eight hours. 

No. 86 is radon, symbol Rn; 
its first name immediately after 
discovery was “radium emana- 
tion.” Since this was a clumsy 
word, the name “niton” was pro- 
posed, but radon was chosen. 

No. 87 is now francium; an 
earlier claim to its discovery had 
proposed the name virginium. 
The symbol for francium is Fa. 
No. 88 is radium; No. 89, 
actinium; No. 90, thorium; No. 
91, protactinium (the alternate 
form of the name, protoactinium, 
has been dropped) and No. 92, 
uranium. This was for many 
years considered the heaviest 
(with reference to its atomic 
weight) naturally occurring ele- 
ment. 

Only fairly recently was it dis- 
covered that plutonium, which 
has a still higher atomic weight, 
does occur naturally in the very 
faintest of traces — it is far rarer 
naturally than the very rare 
radium. It is fully justified, there- 
fore, to call all the “trans-uranic 
elements” artificial. 



No. 93 is neptunium, No. 94, 
plutonium, with the symbols Np, 
and Pu. No. 95 is americium 
(symbol Am), No. 96, curium 
(symbol Cm) and Nos. 97 and 
98, californium and berkelium, 
with the symbols Cf and Bk. 

Should the whole mess be sim- 
plified? No doubt, but I’m afraid 
the revision would cause even 
more argument and confusion, 
calling for top-level conferences. 
Meanwhile, chemists can and do 
work with it, which is the impor- 
tant thing.

T is an outrage,” said 

■ Koltan of the House of 

■ Masur, “that the Earth- 
men land among the Thora- 
bians!” 

Zotul, youngest of the Masur 
brothers, stirred uneasily. Per- 
sonally, he was in favor of the 
coming of the Earthmen to the 
world of Zur. 

At the head of the long, shin- 
ing table sat old Kalrab Masur, 
in his dotage, but still giving 



what he could of aid and comfort 
to the Pottery of Masur, even 
though nobody listened to him 
any more and he knew it. 
Around the table sat the six 
brothers — Koltan, eldest and Di- 
rector of the Pottery; Morvan, 
his vice-chief; Singula, their 
treasurer; Thendro, sales man- 
ager; Lubiosa, export chief; and 
last in the rank of age, Zotul, 
who was responsible for affairs 
of design. 



A GIFT FROM EARTH

“Behold, my sons,” said Kal- 
rab, stroking his scanty beard. 
“What are these Earthmen to 
worry about? Remember the 
clay. It is our strength and our 
fortune. It is the muscle and bone 
of our trade. Earthmen may 
come and Earthmen may go, but 
clay goes on forever . and with 
it, the fame and fortune of the 
House of Masur.” 

“It is a damned imposition,” 
agreed Morvan, ignoring his 
father’s philosophical attitude. 
“They could have landed just as 
easily here in Lor.” 

“The Thorabians will lick up 
the gravy,” said Singula, whose 
mind ran rather to matters of 
financial aspect, “and leave us 
the grease.” 

By this, he seemed to imply 
that the Thorabians would rob 
the Earthmen, which the Lorians 
would not. The truth was that 
all on Zur were panting to get 
their hands on that marvelous 
ship, which was all of metal, a 
very scarce commodity on Zur, 
worth billions of ken. 

T UBIOSA, who had interests 
in Thorabia, and many 
agents there, kept his own coun- 
sel. His people were active in the 
matter and that was enough for 
him. He would report when the 
time was ripe. 

“Doubtless,” said Zotul unex- 
pectedly, for the youngest at a 



conference was expected to keep 
his mouth shut and applaud the 
decisions of his elders, “the 
Earthmen used all the metal on 
their planet in building that ship. 
We cannot possibly bilk them of 
it; it is their only means of 
transport.” 

Such frank expression of mo- 
tive was unheard of, even in the 
secret conclave of conference. 
Only the speaker’s ycath could 
account for it. The speech drew 
scowls from the brothers and 
stern rebuke from Koltan. 

“When your opinion is wanted, 
we will ask you for it. Meantime, 
remember your position in the 
family.” 

Zotul bowed his head meekly, 
but he burned with resentment. 

“Listen to the boy,” said the 
aged father. “There is more wis- 
dom in his head than in all the 
rest of you. Forget the Earthmen 
and think only of the clay.” 

Zotul did not appreciate his 
father’s approval, for it only 
earned him a beating as soon as 
the old man went to bed. It was 
a common enough thing among 
the brothers Masur, as among 
everybody, to be frustrated in 
their desires. However, they had 
Zotul to take it out upon, and 
they did. 

Still smarting, Zotul went back 
to his designing quarters and 
thought about the Earthmen. If 
it was impossible to hope for

much in the way of metal from 
the Earthmen, what could one get 
from them? If he could figure 
this problem out, he might rise 
somewhat in the estimation of his 
brothers. That wouldn’t take him 
out of the rank of scapegoat, of 
course, but the beatings might 
become fewer and less severe. 

¥> Y and by, the Earthmen came 
to Lor, flying through the air 
in strange metal contraptions. 
They paraded through the tile- 
paved streets of the city, marv- 
eled here, as they had in Tho- 
rabia, at the buildings all of tile 
inside and out, and made a great 
show of themselves for all the 
people to see. Speeches were 
made through interpreters, who 
had much too quickly learned 
the tongue of the aliens; hence 
these left much to be desired in 
the way of clarity, though their 
sincerity was evident. 

The Earthmen were going to 
do great things for the whole 
world of Zur. It required but the 
cooperation — an excellent word, 
that — of all Zurians, and many 
blessings would rain down from 
the skies. This, in effect, was 
what the Earthmen had to say. 
Zotul felt greatly cheered, for it 
refuted the attitude of his broth- 
ers without earning him a whal- 
ing for it. 

There was also some talk going 
around about agreements made 



between the Earthmen and offi- 
cials of the Lorian government, 
but you heard one thing one day 
and another the next. Accurate 
reporting, much less a newspaper, 
was unknown on Zur. 

Finally, the Earthmen took off 
in their great, shining ship. Ob- 
viously, none had succeeded in 
chiseling them out of it, if, in- 
deed, any had tried. The anti- 
Earthmen Faction — in any cul- 
ture complex, there is always an 
“anti” faction to protest any 
movement of endeavor — crowed 
happily that the Earthmen were 
gone for good, and a good thing, 
too. 

Such jubilation proved prema- 
ture, however. One day, a fleet 
of ships arrived and after they 
had landed all over the planet, 
Zur was practically acrawl with 
Earthmen. 

Immediately, the Earthmen 
established what they called 
“corporations” — Zurian trading 
companies under terrestrial con- 
trol. The object of the visit was 
trade. 

In spite of the fact that a ter- 
restrial ship had landed at every 
Zurian city of major and minor 
importance, and all in a single 
day, it took some time for the 
news to spread. 

The first awareness Zotul had 
was that, upon coming home 
from the pottery one evening, he 
found his wife Lania proudly 



82 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



brandishing an aluminum pot at 
him. 

“What is that thing?” he asked 
curiously. 

“A pot. I bought it at the mar- 
ket.” 

“Did you now? Well, take it 
back. Am I made of money that 
you spend my substance for some 
fool’s product of precious metal? 
Take it back, I say!” 

T HE pretty young wife laughed 
at him. “Up to your ears in 
clay, no wonder you hear nothing 
of news! The pot is very cheap. 
The Earthmen are selling them 
everywhere. They’re much bet- 
ter than our old clay pots; 
they’re light and easy to handle 
and they don’t break when drop- 
ped.” 

“What good is it?” asked Zo- 
tul, interested. “How will it hold 
heat, being so light?” 

“The Earthmen don’t cook as 
we do,” she explained patiently. 
“There is a paper with each pot 
that explains how it is used. And 
you will have to design a new 
ceramic stove for me to use the 
the pots on.” 

“Don’t be idiotic! Do you sup- 
pose Koltan would agree to pro- 
duce a new type of stove when 
the old has sold well for cen- 
turies? Besides, why do you need 
a whole new stove for one little 
pot?” 

“A dozen pots. They come in 



sets and are cheaper that way. 
And Koltan will have to produce 
the new stove because all the 
housewives are buying these pots 
and there will be a big demand 
for it. The Earthman said so.” 
“He did, did he? These pots 
are only a fad. You will soon 
enough go back to cooking with 
your old ones.” 

“The Earthman took them in 
trade — one reason why the new 
ones are so cheap. There isn’t a 
pot in the house but these metal 
ones, and you will have to design 
and produce a new stove if you 
expect me to use them.” 

After he had beaten his wife 
thoroughly for her foolishness, 
Zotul stamped off in a rage and 
designed a new ceramic stove, 
one that would accommodate the 
terrestrial pots very well. 

And Koltan put the model into 
production. 

“Orders already are pouring in 
like mad,” he said the next day. 
“It was wise of you to foresee it 
and have the design ready. Al- 
ready, I am sorry for thinking as 
I did about the Earthmen. They 
really intend to do well by us.” 
The kilns of the Pottery of 
Masur fired day and night to 
keep up with the demand for the 
new porcelain stoves. In three 
years, more than a million had 
been made and sold by the Ma- 
surs alone, not counting the hun- 
dreds of thousands of copies 



A GIFT FROM EARTH

turned out by competitors in 
every land. 

I N the meantime, however, more 
things than pots came from 
Earth. One was a printing press, 
the like of which none on Zur 
had ever dreamed. This, for some 
unknown reason and much to the 
disgust of the Lorians, was set 
up in Thorabia. Books and ma- 
gazines poured from it in a fan- 
tastic stream. The populace 
fervidly brushed up on its scanty 
reading ability and bought every- 
thing available, overcome by the 
novelty of it. Even Zotul bought 
a book — a primer in the Lorian 
language — and learned how to 
read and write. The remainder of 
the brothers Masur, on the other 
hand, preferred to remain in ig- 
norance. 

Moreover, the Earthmen 
brought miles of copper wire — 
more than enough in value to buy 
out the governorship of any 
country on Zur — and set up tele- 
graph lines from country to coun- 
try and continent to continent. 
Within five years of the first 
landing of the Earthmen, every 
major city on the globe had a 
printing press, a daily newspaper, 
and enjoyed the instantaneous 
transmission of news via tele- 
graph. And the business of the 
House of Masur continued to 
look up. 

“As I have always said from 



the beginning,” chortled Director 
Koltan, “this coming of the 
Earthmen had been a great thing 
for us, and especially for the 
House of Masur.” 

“You didn’t think so at first,” 
Zotul pointed out, and was im- 
mediately sorry, for Koltan turn- 
ed and gave him a hiding, single- 
handed, for his unthinkable im- 
pertinence. 

It would do no good, Zotul 
realized, to bring up the fact that 
their production of ceramic cook- 
ing pots had dropped off to about 
two per cent of its former volume. 
Of course, profits on the line of 
new stoves greatly overbalanced 
the loss, so that actually they 
were ahead; but their business 
was now dependent upon the sup- 
ply of the metal pots from 
Earth. 

About this time, plastic uten- 
sils — dishes, cups, knives, forks — 
made their appearance on Zur. 
It became very stylish to eat with 
the newfangled paraphernalia . 
and very cheap, too, because for 
everything they sold, the Earth- 
men always took the old ware in 
trade. What they did with the 
stuff had been hard to believe at 
first. They destroyed it, which 
proved how valueless it really 
was. 

The result of the new flood was 
that in the following year, the 
sale of Masur ceramic table serv- 
ice dropped to less than a tenth. 



84 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



npREMBLING with excitement 
at this news from their book- 
keeper, Koltan called an emer- 
gency meeting. He even routed 
old Kalrab out of his senile stu- 
por for the occasion, on the off 
chance that the old man might 
still have a little wit left that 
could be helpful. 

“Note,” Koltan announced in 
a shaky voice, “that the Earth- 
men undermine our business,” 
and he read off the figures. 

“Perhaps,” said Zotul, “it is a 
good thing also, as you said be- 
fore, and will result in something 
even better for us.” 

Koltan frowned, and Zotul, in 
fear of another beating, instantly 
subsided. 

“They are replacing our high- 
quality ceramic ware with infe- 
rior terrestrial junk,” Koltan 
went on bitterly. “It is only the 
glamor that sells it, of course, 
but before the people get the 
shine out of their eyes, we can be 
ruined.” 

The brothers discussed the 
situation for an hour, and all the 
while Father Kalrab sat and 
pulled his scanty whiskers. See- 
ing that they got nowhere with 
their wrangle, he cleared his 
throat and spoke up. 

“My sons, you forget it is not 
the Earthmen themselves at the 
bottom of your trouble, but 
the things of Earth. Think of 
the telegraph and the newspaper, 



how these spread news of every 
shipment from Earth. The mer- 
chandise of the Earthmen is put 
up for sale by means of these 
newspapers, which also are the 
property of the Earthmen. The 
people are intrigued by these ad- 
vertisements, as they are called, 
and flock to buy. Now, if you 
would pull a tooth from the kwi 
that bites you, you might also 
have advertisements of your 
own.” 

Alas for that suggestion, no 
newspaper would accept adver- 
tising from the House of Masur; 
all available space was occupied 
by the advertisements of the 
Earthmen. 

In their dozenth conference 
since that first and fateful one, 
the brothers Masur decided upon 
drastic steps. In the meantime, 
several things had happened. For 
one, old Kalrab had passed on 
to his immortal rest, but this 
made no real difference. For an- 
other, the Earthmen had pro- 
cured legal authority to prospect 
the planet for metals, of which 
they found a good deal, but they 
told no one on Zur of this. What 
they did mention was the crude 
oil and natural gas they discov- 
ered in the underlayers of the 
planet’s crust. Crews of Zurians, 
working under supervision of the 
Earthmen, laid pipelines from the 
gas and oil regions to every ma- 
jor and minor city on Zur. 



A GIFT FROM EARTH

"OY the time ten years had 
-^passed since the landing of the 
first terrestrial ship, the Earth- 
men were conducting a brisk 
business in gas-fired ranges, 
furnaces and heaters . and the 
Masur stove business was gone. 
Moreover, the Earthmen sold the 
Zurians their own natural gas at 
a nice profit and everybody was 
happy with the situation except 
the brothers Masur. 

The drastic steps of the broth- 
ers applied, therefore, to making 
an energetic protest to the gov- 
ernor of Lor. 

At one edge of the city, an area 
had been turned over to the 
Earthmen for a spaceport, and 
the great terrestrial spaceships 
came to it and departed from it 
at regular intervals. As the heirs 
of the House of Masur walked 
by on their way to see the gov- 
ernor, Zotul observed that much 
new building was taking place 
and wondered what it was. 

“Some new devilment of the 
Earthmen, you can be sure,” said 
Koltan blackly. 

In fact, the Earthmen were 
building an assembly plant for 
radio receiving sets. The ship now 
standing on its fins upon the 
apron was loaded with printed 
circuits, resistors, variable con- 
densers and other radio parts. 
This was Earth’s first step toward 
flooding Zur with the natural 
follow-up in its campaign of ad- 



vertising — radio programs — with 
commercials. 

Happily for the brothers, they 
did not understand this at the 
time or they would surely have 
gone back to be buried in their 
own clay. 

“I think,” the governor told 
them, “that you gentlemen have 
not paused to consider the affair 
from all angles. You must learn 
to be modern — keep up with the 
times! We heads of government 
on Zur are doing all in our power 
to aid the Earthmen and facili- 
tate their bringing a great, new 
culture that can only benefit us. 
See how Zur has changed in ten 
short years! Imagine the world 
of tomorrow! Why, do you know 
they are even bringing autos to 
Zur!” 

The brothers were fascinated 
with the governor’s description 
of these hitherto unheard-of 
vehicles. 

“It only remains,” concluded 
the governor, “to build highways, 
and the Earthmen are taking 
care of that.” 

At any rate, the brothers Ma- 
sur were still able to console 
themselves that they had their 
tile business. Tile served well 
enough for houses and street sur- 
facing; what better material 
could be devised for the new 
highways the governor spoke of? 
There was a lot of money to be 
made yet. 



86

R ADIO stations went up all 
over Zur and began broad- 
casting. The people bought re- 
ceiving sets like mad. The auto- 
mobiles arrived and highways 
were constructed. 

The last hope of the brothers 
was dashed. The Earthmen set 
up plants and began to manufac- 
ture Portland cement. 

You could build a house of 
concrete much cheaper than with 
tile. Of course, since wood was 
scarce on Zur, it was no competi- 
tion for either tile or concrete. 
Concrete floors were smoother, 
too, and the stuff made far better 
road surfacing. 

The demand for Masur tile hit 
rock bottom. 

The next time the brothers 
went to see the governor, he said, 
“I cannot handle such complaints 
as yours. I must refer you to the 
Merchandising Council.” , 

“What is that?” asked Koltan. 
“It is an Earthman association 
that deals with complaints such 
as yours. In the matter of ma- 
terial progress, we must expect 
some strain in the fabric of our 
culture. Machinery has been set 
up to deal with it. Here is their 
address; go air your troubles to 
them.” 

The business of a formal com- 
plaint was turned over by the 
brothers to Zotul. It took three 
weeks for the Earthmen to get 
around to calling him in, as a 

A GIFT FROM EARTH 



representative of the Pottery of 
Masur, for an interview. 

All the brothers could no long- 
er be spared from the plant, even 
for the purpose of pressing a com- 
plaint. Their days of idle wealth 
over, they had to get in and work 
with the clay with the rest of the 
help. 

Zotul found the headquarters 
of the Merchandising Council as 
indicated on their message. He 
had not been this way in some 
time, but was not surprised to 
find that a number of old build- 
ings had been torn down to make 
room for the concrete Council 
House and a roomy parking lot, 
paved with something called 
“blacktop” and jammed with an 
array of glittering new automo- 
biles. 

An automobile was an expense 
none of the brothers could afford, 
now that they barely eked a liv- 
ing from the pottery. Still, Zotul 
ached with desire at sight of so 
many shiny cars. Only a few had 
them and they were the envied 
ones of Zur. 

Kent Broderick, the Earthman 
in charge of the Council, shook 
hands jovially with Zotul. That 
alien custom conformed with, Zo- 
tul took a better look at his host. 
Broderick was an affable, smiling 
individual with genial laugh 
wrinkles at his eyes. A man of 
middle age, dressed in the baggy 
costume of Zur, he looked almost 



87 



like a Zurian, except for an in- 
definite sense of alienness about 
him. 

“Glad to have you call on us, 
Mr. Masur,” boomed the Earth- 
man, clapping Zotul on the back. 
“Just tell us your troubles and 
we’ll have you straightened out 
in no time.” 

A LL the chill recriminations 
and arguments Zotul had 
stored for this occasion were dis- 
sipated in the warmth of the 
Earthman’s manner. 

Almost apologetically, Zotul 
told of the encroachment that 
had been made upon the business 
of the Pottery of Masur. 

“Once,” he said formally, “the 
Masur fortune was the greatest 
in the world of Zur. That was 
before my father, the famous 
Kalrab Masur — Divinity protect 
him — departed this life to collect 
his greater reward. He often told 
us, my father did, that the clay 
is the flesh and bones of our cul- 
ture and our fortune. Now it has 
been shown how prone is the flesh 
to corruption and how feeble the 
bones. We are ruined, and all be- 
cause of new things coming from 
Earth.” 

Broderick stroked his shaven 
chin and looked sad. “Why didn’t 
you come to me sooner? This 
would never have happened. But 
now that it has, we’re going to 
do right by you. That is the pol- 



icy of Earth — always to do right 
by the customer.” 

“Divinity witness,” Zorin said, 
“that we ask only compensation 
for damages.” 

Broderick shook his head. “It 
is not possible to replace an im- 
mense fortune at this late date. 
As I said, you should have re- 
ported your trouble sooner. How- 
ever, we can give you an oppor- 
tunity to rebuild. Do you own 
an automobile?” 

“No.” 

“A gas range? A gas-fired fur- 
nace? A radio?” 

Zotul had to answer no to all 
except the radio. “My wife Lania 
likes the music,” he explained. “I 
cannot afford the other things.” 
Broderick clucked sympathet- 
ically. One who could not afford 
the bargain-priced merchandise 
of Earth must be poor indeed. 

“To begin with,” he said, “I 
am going to make you a gift of 
all these luxuries you do not 
have.” As Zotul made to protest, 
he cut him off with a wave of his 
hand. “It is the least we can do 
for you. Pick a car from the lot 
outside. I will arrange to have 
the other things delivered and in- 
stalled in your home.” 

“To receive gifts,” said Zotul, 
“incurs an obligation.” 

“None at all,” beamed the 
Earthman cheerily. “Every item 
is given to you absolutely free — 
a gift from the people of Earth. 



88 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



All we ask is that you pay the 
freight charges on the items. Our 
purpose is not to make profit, but 
to spread technology and pros- 
perity throughout the Galaxy. 
We have already done well on 
numerous worlds, but working 
out the full program takes time.” 
He chuckled deeply. “We of 
Earth have a saying about one of 
our extremely slow-moving na- 
tive animals. We say, ‘Slow is the 
tortoise, but sure.’ And so. with 
us. Our goal is a long-range one, 
with the motto, ‘Better times 
with better merchandise.’ ” 

T HE engaging manner of the 
man won Zotul’s confidence. 
After all, it was no more than 
fair to pay transportation. 

He said, “How much does the 
freight cost?” 

Broderick told him. 

“It may seem high,” said the 
Earthman, “but remember that 
Earth is sixty-odd light-years 
away. After all, we are absorbing 
the cost of the merchandise. All 
you pay is the freight, which is 
cheap, considering the cost of 
operating an interstellar space- 
ship.” 

“Impossible,” said Zotul drab- 
ly. “Not I and all my brothers 
together have so much money 
any more.” 

“You don’t know us of Earth 
very well yet, but you will. I 
offer you credit!” 

A GIFT FROM EARTH 



“What is that?” asked Zotul 
skeptically. 

“It is how the poor are enabled 
to enjoy all the luxuries of the 
rich,” said Broderick, and went 
on to give a thumbnail sketch of 
the involutions and devolutions 
of credit, leaving out some an- 
gles that might have had a dis- 
couraging effect. 

On a world where credit was 
a totally new concept, it was en- 
chanting. Zotul grasped at the 
glittering promise with avidity. 
“What must I do to get credit?” 

“Just sign this paper,” said 
Broderick, “and you become part 
of our Easy Payment Plan.” 

Zotul drew back. “I have five 
brothers. If I took all these things 
for myself and nothing for them, 
they would beat me black and 
blue.” 

“Here.” Broderick handed him 
a sheaf of chattel mortgages. 
“Have each of your brothers sign 
one of these, then bring them 
back to me. That is all there is 
to it.” 

It sounded wonderful. But how 
would the brothers take it? Zotul 
wrestled with his misgivings and 
the misgivings won. 

“I will talk it over with them,” 
he said. “Give me the total so I 
will have the figures.” 

The total was more than it 
ought to be by simple addition. 
Zotul pointed this out politely. 

“Interest,” Broderick explain- 

89 



ed. “A mere fifteen per cent. After 
all, you get the merchandise free. 
The transportation company has 
to be paid, so another company 
loans you the money to pay for 
the freight. This small extra sum 
pays the lending company for its 
trouble.” 

“I see.” Zotul puzzled over it 
sadly. “It is too much,” he said. 
“Our plant doesn’t make enough 
money for us to meet the pay- 
ments.” 

“I have a surprise for you,” 
smiled Broderick. “Here is a con- 
tract. You will start making ce- 
ramic parts for automobile spark 
plugs and certain parts for radios 
and gas ranges. It is our policy 
to encourage local manufacture 
to help bring prices down.” 

“We haven’t the equipment.” 

“We will equip your plant,” 
beamed Broderick. “It will re- 
quire only a quarter interest in 
your plant itself, assigned to our 
terrestrial company.” 

^#OTUL, anxious to possess the 
treasures promised by the 
Earthman, won over his brothers. 
They signed with marks and gave 
up a quarter interest in the Pot- 
tery of Masur. They rolled in the 
luxuries of Earth. These, who had 
never known debt before, were in 
it up to their ears. 

The retooled plant forged 
ahead and profits began to look 
up, but the Earthmen took a 



fourth of them as their share in 
the industry. 

For a year, the brothers drove 
their shiny new cars about on 
the new concrete highways the 
Earthmen had built. From 
pumps owned by a terrestrial 
company, they bought gas and 
oil that had been drawn from the 
crust of Zur and was sold to the 
Zurians at a magnificent profit. 
The food they ate was cooked in 
Earthly pots on Earth-type gas 
ranges, served up on metal plates 
that had been stamped out on 
Earth. In the winter, they toasted 
their shins, before handsome gas 
grates, though they had gas-fired 
central heating. 

About this time, the ships from 
Earth brought steam-powered 
electric generators. Lines went 
up, power was generated, and a 
flood of electrical gadgets and 
appliances hit the market. For 
some reason, batteries for the ra- 
dios were no longer available and 
everybody had to buy the new 
radios. And who could do with- 
out a radio in this modern age? 

The homes of the brothers 
Masur blossomed on the Easy 
Payment Plan. They had refrig- 
erators, washers, driers, toasters, 
grills, electric fans, air-condi- 
tioning equipment and every- 
thing else Earth could possibly 
sell them. 

“We will be forty years pay- 
ing it all off,” exulted Zotul, “but 



90 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



meantime we have the things and 
aren’t they worth it?” 

But at the end of three years, 
the Earthmen dropped their op- 
tion. The Pottery of Masur had 
no more contracts. Business lan- 
guished. The Earthmen, explain- 
ed Broderick, had built a plant 
of their own because it was so 
much more efficient — and to 
lower prices, which was Earth’s 
unswerving policy, greater and 
greater efficiency was demanded. 
Broderick was very sympathetic, 
but there was nothing he could 
do. 

The introduction of television 
provided a further calamity. The 
sets were delicate and needed fre- 
quent repairs, hence were costly 
to own and maintain. But all 
Zurians who had to keep up with 
the latest from Earth had them. 
Now it was possible not only to 
hear about things of Earth, but 
to see them as they were broad- 
cast from the video tapes. 

The printing plants that turn- 
ed out mortgage contracts did a 
lush business. 

FT'OR the common people of 
Zur, times were good every- 
where. In a decade and a half, 
the Earthmen had wrought mag- 
nificent changes on this back- 
ward world. As Broderick had 
said, the progress of the tortoise 
was slow, but it was extremely 
sure. 



The brothers Masur got along 
in spite of dropped options. They 
had less money and felt the pinch 
of their debts more keenly, but 
television kept their wives and 
children amused and furnished 
an anodyne for the pangs of im- 
poverishment. 

The pottery income dropped 
to an impossible low, no matter 
how Zotul designed and the 
brothers produced. Their figur- 
ines and religious ikons were a 
drug on the market. The Earth- 
men made them of plastic and 
sold them for less. 

The brothers, unable to meet 
the Payments that were not so 
Easy any more, looked up Zotul 
and cuffed him around reproach- 
fully. 

“You got us into this,” they 
said, emphasizing their bitterness 
with fists. “Go see Broderick. 
Tell him we are undone and 
must have some contracts to con- 
tinue operating.” 

Nursing bruises, Zotul unhap- 
pily went to the Council House 
again. Mr. Broderick was no 
longer with them, a suave as- 
sistant informed him. Would he 
like to see Mr. Siwicki instead? 
Zotul would. 

Siwicki was tall, thin, dark and 
somber-looking. There was even 
a hint of toughness about the 
set of his jaw and the hardness 
of his glance. 

“So you can’t pay,” he said, 



A GIFT FROM EARTH 



91 



tapping his teeth with a pencil. 
He looked at Zotul coldly. “It is 
well you have come to us in- 
stead of making it necessary for 
us to approach you through the 
courts.” 

“I don’t know what you 
mean,” said Zotul. 

“If we have to sue, we take 
back the merchandise and every- 
thing attached to them. That 
means you would lose your 
houses, for they are attached to 
the furnaces. However, it is not 
as bad as that — yet. We will only 
require you to assign the remain- 
ing three-quarters of your pot- 
tery to us.” 

The brothers, when they heard 
of this, were too stunned to think 
of beating Zotul, by which he 
assumed he had progressed a lit- 
tle and was somewhat comforted. 

“To fail,” said Koltan soberly, 
“is not a Masur attribute. Go to 
the governor and tell him what 
we think of this business. The 
House of Masur has long sup- 
ported the government with 
heavy taxes. Now it is time for 
the government to do something 
for us.” 

THHE governor’s palace was 
jammed with hurrying peo- 
ple, a scene of confusion that 
upset Zotul. The clerk who took 
his application for an interview 
was, he noticed only vaguely, a 
young Earthwoman. It was re- 



markable that he paid so little 
attention, for the female terres- 
trials were picked for physical 
assets that made Zurian men 
covetous and Zurian women en- 
vious. 

“The governor will see you,” 
she said sweetly. “He has been 
expecting you.” 

“Me?” marveled Zotul. 

She ushered him into the mag- 
nificent private office of the gov- 
ernor of Lor. The man behind 
the desk stood up, extended his 
hand with a friendly smile. 

“Come in, come in! I’m glad 
to see you again.” 

Zotul stared blankly. This was 
not the governor. This was Brod- 
erick, the Earthman. 

“I — I came to see the gover- 
nor,” he said in confusion. 

Broderick nodded agreeably. 
“I am the governor and I am 
well acquainted with your case, 
Mr. Masur. Shall we talk it over? 
Please sit down.” 

“I don’t understand. The 
Earthmen . Zotul paused, 
coloring. “We are about to lose 
our plant.” 

“You were about to say that 
the Earthmen are taking your 
plant away from you. That is 
true. Since the House of Masur 
was the largest and richest on 
Zur, it has taken a long time — 
the longest of all, in fact.” 
“What do you mean?” 

“Yours is the last business on 



92 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Zur to be taken over by us. We 
have bought you out.” 

“Our government . .” 

“Your governments belong to 
us, too,” said Broderick. “When 
they could not pay for the roads, 
the telegraphs, the civic im- 
provements, we took them over, 
just as we are taking you over.” 
“You mean,” exclaimed Zotul, 
aghast, “that you Earthmen own 
everything on Zur?” 

“Even your armies.” 

“But why?" 

|> RODERICK clasped his 
hands behind back, went to 
the window and stared down 
moodily into the street. 

“You don’t know what an 
overcrowded world is like,” he 
said. “A street like this, with so 
few people and vehicles on it, 
would be impossible on Earth.” 
“But it’s mobbed,” protested 
Zotul. “It gave me a headache.” 
“And to us it’s almost empty. 
The pressure of population on 
Earth has made us range the 
Galaxy for places to put our ex- 
tra people. The only habitable 
planets, unfortunately, are pop- 
ulated ones. We take the least 
populous worlds and — well, buy 
them out and move in.” 

“And after that?” 

Broderick smiled gently. “Zur 
will grow. Our people will inter- 
marry with yours. The future 
population of Zur will be neither 



true Zurians nor true Earthmen, 
but a mixture of both.” 

Zotul sat in silent thought. 
“But you did not have to buy 
us out. You had the power to 
conquer us, even to destroy us. 
The whole planet could have 
been yours alone.” He stopped in 
alarm. “Or am I suggesting an 
idea that didn’t occur to you?” 
“No,” said Broderick, his usu- 
ally smiling face almost pained 
with memory. “We know the his- 
tory of conquest all too well. Our 
method causes more distress than 
we like to inflict, but it’s better 
— and more sure — than war and 
invasion by force. Now that the 
unpleasant job is finished, we can 
repair the dislocations.” 

“At last I understand what you 
said about the tortoise.” 

“Slow but sure.” Broderick 
beamed again and clapped Zotul 
on the shoulder. “Don’t worry. 
You’ll have your job back, the 
same as always, but you’ll be 
working for us . until the chil- 
dren of Earth and Zur are equal 
in knowledge and therefore equal 
partners. That’s why we had to 
break down your caste system.” 
Zotul’s eyes widened. “And 
that is why my brothers did not 
beat me when I failed!” 

“Of course. Are you ready now 
to take the assignment papers for 
you and your brothers to sign?” 
“Yes,” said Zotul. “I am 
ready.” —MANLY BANISTER

like a freak— now there was the 
horror of what I had done to .

Illustrated by ASHMAN 



F eeling numb, i put the 

phone down. I’ve got to get 
out of here, I thought. I’ve 
got to go ask old Frozen Face. 
I’ve got to get home. 

But there was the old man, 
just that minute coming out of 
his office. For the first time, I was 
glad he’d put my desk out there 
in front of the golden-oak slab 
of his door, like a welcome mat. 
I looked up at him and I guess I 
looked anxious. 

He stopped beside me. “Some- 
thing wrong?” 

I wet my lips, but I couldn’t 
say anything. Stupid! Why 
shouldn’t I be able to say I’ve 
got to get out of here ! 



“The kid?” 

“Yes,” I said. “We have to take 
her in this afternoon ” 

“Well, get out of here,” he said 
brusquely. 

I stood up. I couldn’t look at 
him. “Thanks.” 

“Shaddap,” he said gruffly. 
“Call up if you need anything.” 
“I won’t need anything.” Ex- 
cept courage. Faith, if you like. 
And whatever kind of hypocrisy 
it takes to conceal from a child 
how scared you are. 

I reached for my hat. Old 
Frozen Face just stood there. I 
looked back from the outer door 
and he was still there, staring at 
the place where I’d been.

1 ALMOST yelled at him some 
explosive, blathering series of 
syllables that would in some way 
explain to him that I’m not a 
freak; look at the creases in my 
blue pants ; look at my shoeshine, 
just the same as yours; look how 
my hairline’s receding — look, 
look, I’ve got heartburn and 
lumps in my throat! 

At the same time, I wanted to 
yell something else, something 
about, yes, you were kind to me 
because you know what’s with 
me, with my kid; but you can’t 
know how it is. With you, I’m 
once removed from anything you 
could feel, like the Hundred 
Neediest Cases in the newspaper 
at Christmas. You believe it, 
sure, but you can’t know how 
it is. 

So with one inner voice saying 
I’m what you are and another 
saying You can’t know how it is, 
I let them crash together and si- 
lence one another, and said noth- 
ing, but made the frosted glass 
door swing shut and walked over 
to the elevators. 

I had to wait and that seemed 
wrong. I looked at the indicators, 
and saw that all of the cars were 
running, and that seemed wrong, 
too. Everything else ought to stop 
except one car for me and it 
ought to be here now! I stood 
there realizing how irrational all 
this was, but fuming anyway. 
Behind me, I heard thunk- pat, 



thunk- pat, and from the corner 
of my eye saw it was Bernie Pitt 
on his crutches. I turned very 
slightly so my back was to him. 
Bernie is a very nice guy, but I 
just didn’t want to talk to any- 
body. It was as if talking to 
somebody would slow up the ele- 
vator. 

I hoped he hadn’t noticed my 
turning away like that. Then I 
found I could see his reflection 
in the polished gray-green marble 
of the wall by the elevator. He 
was looking at me; I could see 
his face tilt as he glanced down 
at the hat I was twisting in my 
hands. Then it tipped up and 
back a little as he studied the 
tops of the doors, the way a man 
does when he wants to look as if 
he’s absorbed in his own thoughts. 
So he’d seen that hat, at ten in 
the morning, and that meant I 
was going out, and he knew all 
about me and Twink and the ac- 
cident, and was being considerate. 

Old Frozen Face was being con- 
siderate, too. Old Frozen Face 
always did the correctly consid- 
erate thing. Like hiring Bernie, 
who was a cripple. 

I hated myself for thinking 
that. 

It made me hate Bernie. I 
glared at his reflection. Just then, 
one of the elevator doors across 
the corridor rolled open and I 
jumped and spun. 

“Up!” said the operator.

Bernie stumped into it without 
looking at me. The door closed. 
I wished I had a rock to throw 
at it. 

I tried hard to get hold of my- 
self. I knew what was happening. 
Scare a man badly enough, and 
then make the thing he fears dif- 
fuse and unreachable, and he’ll 
lash out indiscriminately at ev- 
erything and everyone. Well, lash 
away, boy, I told myself, and 
get it out of your stinking small- 
minded system before you get 
home. 

“Down?” the operator asked. 

S HOULDERING into the car, 
I felt I had a right to be sore 
at the operator for taking so long. 
The elevator was full of intruders 
and the descent took forever, and 
for a moment I got so mad, I 
swear I could have hunched my 
shoulders and sprayed them all 
with adrenalin. Then the doors 
opened again and there was the 
lobby like a part of all outdoors, 
and the offices upstairs no longer 
contained or confined me, and 
their people no longer intruded. 

I scurried down the steps and 
along the concourse to the inter- 
urban station, trusting my feet 
and letting the rest of me fly 
along with the eager aimlessness 
of a peace-dove released at a 
school pageant. 

How can there be any unreality 
in your cosmos? I asked myself. 



The day Twink goes to the hos- 
pital — that’s today; it’s here. It’s 
been a real thing all this time, for 
all it was in the future; it was 
more real than most other things 
in the world. And now it’s come 
and you’re walking underwater, 
seeing through murk. 

But the whole world’s helping, 
too. Nothing is so unreal to the 
commuter as a commuter’s sta- 
tion at ten in the morning. The 
trains, lying in these echoing 
acres, look like great eviscerated 
larva. The funereal train-crew, 
gossiping as if their work was 
done, as if it wasn’t their job to 
get me home before the sawbones 
went to work on my little girl. 

I went to them. “Baytown?” 

They looked at me, a conduc- 
tor, a motorman, a platform 
man. They were different sizes 
and shapes, but their faces were 
all the same gray and contained 
the same damnable sense of the 
fitness of things. They were in a 
place that belonged to them, 
doing the right thing at the right 
time in it. They were steady and 
sober and absolutely at the serv- 
ice of commuters-by-the-ton, but 
a man outbound at ten in the 
morning, though tolerable, could 
hardly be served. He wasn’t what 
they were there for. 

I went into the train and sat 
down and looked at my watch. 
Four minutes. They were going 
to make me wait four minutes. 



TWINK

T SAT in an empty car and 

looked at the glare of yellow 
woven plastic pretending to be 
rattan, steel panels pretending to 
be wood, and the advertising 
signs. There were three kinds of 
signs: the imperatives, which said 
Buy and Drink and Use; the 
comparatives, which said Better, 
Richer, Finer (and never stated 
what they were better and richer 
and finer than); and the nom- 
inatives, which stupidly and 
without explanation proclaimed 
a name. 

I snorted at them all and 
reached for a paper someone had 
left on a nearby seat. If its pre- 
vious owner had been there, I 
think I’d have punched him right 
in the mouth. I’ve always re- 
spected books and I’ve always 
felt that a paper is a sort of book. 
This character had put the mid- 
dle section in upside down, folded 
some sheets back on themselves 
and away from the centerline, so 
that page covers skewed and 
flopped all around, and he had 
generally churned up and muti- 
lated the dead white body before 
discarding it. 

Growling, I began to put it 
back together again. 

CHEERFUL TONY WEAKER 

Doomed Child Sinking. Gifts 

and Cards Pouring In for 
‘Early Birthday’ 



NEW YORK, June 25 (AP)- 
1973’s Child of the Year, five-year- 
old Tony Marshall, has been placed 
under oxygen at Memorial Hospital, 
while a staff of top cancer special- 
ists stand a 24-hour watch at his 
bedside. Hope that he will live to 
see his sixth birthday in August has 
faded. 

The boy, whose famous smile 
made him known from coast to 
coast as Cheerful Tony, is suffering 
from advanced lukemia. 

Angrily I hurled the paper 
away from me. It came to pieces 
in midair and fluttered to the 
floor, to lie there accusingly and 
stare at me. I swore and got up 
and gathered it together and 
crammed it out of sight on the 
seat ahead of mine. 

“Cheerful Tony,” I muttered. 
Some convolution of the face 
muscles, some accident of the 
dental arch, a trick of the light 
and the fortuitous presence of a 
news photographer as lucky as 
the guy who got the flag-raising 
at Iwo — put ’em all together and 
you’ve got a national hero. What 
good did it do to anyone to read 
about Cheerful Tony or to write 
about it? What good did it do 
Tony? 

For an ugly moment, I wished 
I could trade places with Tony’s 
father. All he had to worry about 
was cancer — nice, certain cancer 
— and once it was finished, that 
would be the end of it.

But I didn’t envy him the pub- 
licity, and for the hundred thou- 
sandth time, I thanked the Pow- 
ers that so few people knew 
about Twink. 

The doors slid shut and the 
train started. I let go a sigh of 
relief and hunched back in my 
seat, wondering how to make the 
time go faster. Not the time; the 
train. I pushed my feet uselessly 
against the legs of the next seat, 
made a calm and childish calcu- 
lation of what I was doing (forty 
pounds foot-pressure forward, 
forty pounds shoulder-pressure 
backward — equals zero) and sat 
up feeling like a fool. I began to 
look at the ads again. 

Imperative, comparative, nom- 
inative. 

‘V/I'AYBE my technique had 
-*■” been wrong all along. May- 
be I should have used nothing 
but advertising tactics on Twink 
the whole time. After all, those 
were tested methods, with more 
than a century of proof behind 
them. 

“Relax with oxygen,” I should 
have told her. “Live,” I should 
have told her, twelve times a 
minute, in the best imperative 
mood. “Live . live.” And, 
“Don’t struggle. Let the doctor 
work. It will be easier.” (Than 
what?) And, of course, the per- 
vasive, institutional nominative: 
“Twink. Everybody knows 



Twink. Everybody loves Twink.” 
Until she believes it all . 

TT^HE anger, which had changed 
to hysteria, converted itself 
now into crawling depression. It 
descended on me like the shadow 
of some great reptile, something 
that moved slowly and implacab- 
ly and without human under- 
standing. I felt utterly alone. I 
was different. Apart. More apart 
than Bernie, who had left half 
a leg in Formosa. More than Sue 
Gaskell, who was the only Negro 
in the copy department — by God, 
another “kindness” of old Froz- 
en Face. 

Why couldn’t someone (besides 
Twink) share this with me? Even 
Doris couldn’t. Doris loved me; 
she ate with me, slept with me, 
worried and hoped with me, but 
this thing with Twink was some- 
thing she couldn’t share. She just 
wasn’t equipped for it. Sometimes 
I wondered how she held still for 
that. This might go on for years 
... if Twink lived at all . 
Twink and I sharing a thing that 
Doris could never know, even 
being Twink’s mother. 

Suddenly I found someone else 
to be mad at and the depression 
lifted enough to let it in. You 
guys, I thought, you helpful 
people who put welded track on 
these roadbeds, who designed 
pneumatic dampers and cushion- 
ed wheels for the trains — did it 



TWINK 



99 



ever occur to you that a man 
might want something to listen 
to in a train in 1973? Twenty 
years ago, I could have listened 
to the wheels and I could have 
made up a song to go along with 
them: blippety-clak, blippety- 

clak. 

Blippety-clink, poor little 
Twink, don’t let her die — 

All right, fellows — on second 
thought, you can have your weld- 
ed rails. 

“Baytown,” said the annun- 
ciator in a cultured voice, and 
deceleration helped me up out 
of the seat. 

I went to the door and was 
through it before it had slid all 
the way open, shot down the 
platform while fumbling for my 
commuter’s plate, missed the 
scanner slot with it and skinned 
my knuckles, dropped the plate, 
picked it up, got it into the slot, 
waited forever — well, three sec- 
onds — while it scanned, punched 
and slid out my receipt. 

I was just about to blow a fuse 
because there was no taxi, but 
there was. I couldn’t bark my ad- 
dress because the driver knew it, 
and I couldn’t wave bribes at 
him because he was paid by the 
development, and anyway his 
turbines had a governor to keep 
him from speeding as fast as I 
wanted. All I could do was hud- 
dle on the cushion and bite the 
ball of my thumb. 



T HE house was very quiet. For 
some reason, I had expected 
to find them in the nursery, but 
there wasn’t a sound from there. 
I found Doris stretched out on 
the settee in the den, looking 
drowsy. 

“Doris!” 

“Shh. ’Lo. Twink asleep.” 

I ran to her. “Is she ... do 
you . are you . .” 

She rumpled my hair. “Shhh,” 
she said again. “My goodness, 
it’s going to be all right.” 

I leaned very close and whis- 
pered, “Scared. I’m scared.” 
“I’m scared, too,” she said rea- 
sonably, “but I’m not going to 
go all to pieces.” 

I knelt there, soaking up a 
kind of strength, a kind of peace 
from her. “Sorry, darling. I’ve 
been — ” I shuddered. “On the 
train, I was reading about Cheer- 
ful Tony. I was thinking how 
they’d do the same thing with 
us, if they knew.” 

“Only more.” She half-laughed. 
“All that mail, all those reporters, 
newsreel men. All that glory. All 
that — noise.” 

We listened together to the 
morning silence. It was the first 
time since she’d phoned me that 
I’d noticed how lovely the day 
was. 

“Thank you,” she whispered. 
“For what?” 

“For not telling them. For 
being — well, for just being; I 



100 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



guess that’s what I’m trying to 
say. And for Twink.” 

“For Twink?" 

“Of course. She’s my little girl. 
If it hadn’t been for you, I’d 
never have known her.” 

“I think the way motherhood 
makes people crazy is one of the 
nicest things around,” I said. 

She answered, but with her 
eyes. Then she said, “We have 
to be there at noon.” 

I looked at my watch, leaped 
wildly to my feet, turned left, 
turned right. 

Doris openly laughed at me. 
“How long does it take to get to 
the hospital?” she asked. 

“Well, ten minutes, but we 
have to . don’t we have to, 
uh?” 

“No, we don’t. We have more 
than an hour. Sit down and help 
me be quiet. Want something to 
eat before we go?” 

“No. God, no. Shall I fix—” 

“Not for me.” 

“Oh.” Slowly I sat down again. 

She giggled. “You’re funny.” 

“Yeah.” 

“Have any trouble getting 
away?” She was making talk, I 
knew, but I went right along 
with it. 

“Matter of fact, no,” I said. 
“Old Frozen Face took one look 
at me after you called and chased 
me out.” 

“He’s so wonderful . Honey! 
Don’t call him that!” 



I GROWLED something word- 
less. “He makes me mad.” 
“After all he’s done?” 

“Yes, after all he’s done,” I 
said irritably. 

Because of all he’s done, I 
think. All my life, I’m a misfit 
for one reason or another; then, 
in college, they found out this 
thing about me and I worked my 
way through being a laboratory 
curiosity. I got into the papers. 
Not too much — just enough to 
keep me from getting any decent 
job after I graduated. Except 
with Frozen Face, of course. I 
didn’t apply; he wrote me. He 
hired all his people that way. 
People with half a leg. Blind peo- 
ple in Personnel. Ex-cons who 
couldn’t get started. 

At first, it looked as if his 
people had escaped the things 
that hung over them — thanks to 
him. Then, after a while, you be- 
gan to realize that you wouldn’t 
be working there if you didn’t 
have something wrong with you. 
It was like starving all your life 
until you found you could be well 
fed and taken care of till the day 
you died — in a leprosarium. 

But I said, “Sorry, Doris. Just 
naturally ungrateful, I guess . 
Twink’s waking up.” 

“Oh, dear! I thought she might 
sleep until—” 

“Shh.” 

Ever since the accident (I’d 
turned the car over; they say you 



TWINK 



101 



can’t do that with any car later 
than 1970, but I’m the guy), 
Twink had terrified me every 
time she woke up. She’d come 
out of the normal sleep of a nor- 
mal baby and enter a frightening 
stillness, a cessation of everything 
but life itself. It was, I suppose, 
coma; but I’d lived with seven 
weeks of it once, and even now 
the momentary passage through 
it, from sleep to waking, was so 
loaded with terror and guilt for 
me that it was all I could take. 
And when you add to that the 
fact that I had to hide it, that 
above all else I had to be strength 
to her, and comfort, as she 
awoke — 

Then it was over; she was 
awake, confused, dimly happy. 
“Hi, baby. How’s my Twink?” 
Doris, tense on the couch, not 
breathing, waiting — 

“It’s all right. Twink’s all 
right,” I said. 

“Well, of course!” 

I shot Doris a look. There 
wasn’t a hairline crack in that 
enamel of hers, but it suddenly 
occurred to me that it was past 
time for me to stop using her as 
the pillar of strength around here. 
I bent and kissed her and said 
(making it sound like a joke, be- 
cause I knew she’d prefer it that 
way), “Okay, honey; from here 
on, you can scream curses.” 

“I’ll just do that,” she said 
gratefully. 



TAID the accident have any- 
thing directly to do with it or 
was it just me? Champlain (yes, 
the Champlain, who took up 
where Rhine left off) had a num- 
ber of theories about. The most 
likely one was that when my 
peculiar equipment got stirred up 
enough in the crash and for that 
awful hour afterward, I sent such 
a surge of empathy at Twink 
that I created a response. You 
can call it telepathy if you like — 
Champlain did — but I don’t like 
the sound of that. Of course, I’m 
biased. You can take your extra- 
sensoria, all of them, and — well, 
just take ’em and leave me be. 

It may be that I was better 
equipped than the next guy to 
adjust to this, having lived for 
some eight years with the mild 
notoriety of being the boy who 
never scored less than 88 on the 
Rhine cards. But personally, con- 
stitutionally, I never was meant 
to be different from other people. 
What I mean is that my useless 
ability (I don’t regard it as a 
talent and I won’t call it a gift) 
didn’t have to make any differ- 
ence to anyone. I could be just 
as good a short-order cook, just 
as bad a ticket-taker, as anyone 
else. But I was never given the 
chance of living like a human 
being. 

I could stick around the para- 
psychology laboratories, earning 
a living like an ape in the 200 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



(and not much of a living at 
that; even in this enlightened era, 
there isn’t a rich parapsycholo- 
gist, or I could go out and get a 
job. And the way my dark past 
followed me, you’d think I was 
wearing a Flying Saucer for a 
halo. “Oh, yes — you’re the mind- 
reading fellow.” You know what 
that can do to your prospects? 

Usually I didn’t get the job. 
Once I was hired, though, they 
knew. Twice I landed jobs and 
they found out later. Each time 
there was someone who went to 
the boss, seniority and all, and 
said, “Look, it’s him or me.” And 
guess who got the pink slip. 

Would you work every day 
with somebody who could read 
your mind? Who hasn’t got se- 
crets? Whose life really is an 
open book? I can tell you, I 
wouldn’t work next to someone 
like that, yet I’m about as inof- 
fensive as they come. And what 
was driving me out of my head— 
and I was two-thirds out when I 
met Doris and then Frozen Face 
— was that everyone thought I 
could read minds and I can't! 

T>UT Doris, who had heard of 
me even before she met me, 
never mentioned it. First she was 
nice to be with, and then I had 
to be with her, and then I came 
to a big, fat, soul-searching de- 
cision and confessed All to her 
one night, and she kissed me on 



the end of the nose and said she’d 
known about it all along and it 
didn’t matter; and if I said I 
couldn’t read minds but was only 
good at guessing Rhine cards, 
why, she believed me; and if I 
ever did learn to read minds, she 
wished I’d hurry up and read 
hers, because she was getting 
awfully impatient. After that, I’d 
have married her if she looked 
like a gila monster. Actually she 
looked like the Tenniel Alice-in- 
Wonderland, only with curly 
hair. 

When I came up for breath 
from that interchange, I liked 
people a hell of a lot more than 
I ever had before. I guess that’s 
another way of saying I liked 
myself some, at last. 

Then along came the letter 
from Frozen Face, and Twink 
came up, and the accident hap- 
pened. 

And after the accident, the 
nightmare ability to dip down 
into the living silence that was 
Twink now, an unstirring some- 
thing that couldn’t see or speak 
or hear, something that was 
dreadfully hurt and just hover- 
ing, barely alive.. My kid. And 
after about seven weeks, a move- 
ment, a weak tensing. It was the 
faintest possible echo of fear, and 
always a retreat from it that 
shoved the little thing close to 
dying again. Then there would 
be the silence again, and the stir- 



TWINK 



103 



ring, and the fear and retreat. 

Why I tried, how I thought to 
try, I don’t know, but I did what 
I could each time to reassure her. 
I would tense till I ached and 
say, It’s all right, honey, don’t 
be afraid, it’s all over now. And 
I hoped it helped her, and then I 
thought it did, and then one night 
I knew it did, because I saw the 
tension coming and stopped it, 
and there was a different kind of 
silence, like sleeping, not like 
coma. 

After that, she got better fast, 
and I took hold of the slim hope 
that she might one day see and 
run and climb like other kids, 
hear music, go to school . 

She had to, she had to, or I was 
a murderer. I was worse than 
that. Your out-and-out murderer 
knows what he’s doing. More 
likely than not, he does' it to get 
something, for profit. 

But me — want to know what I 
did? 

We’d been out for a drive in 
our shiny new car — well, it was 
second-hand, but the newest one 
I’d ever owned — and I wanted 
to get a couple of cartons of cig- 
arettes before we crossed the 
state line, to save — guess! — a few 
cents tax. It was a six-lane road, 
three each way. I was in my mid- 
dle lane. 

Doris pointed at a big neon 
sign. “There’s a place!” 

I hauled the wheel over and 



shot straight across the right- 
hand lane. The truck just nipped 
the rear fender and over we went. 

For six cents. Come to think 
of it, I never did buy the cigar- 
ettes, so I can’t even claim that. 

There’s your superman, “wild 
talents” and all. A goddam high- 
way boob. 

Doris and Twink went to the 
hospital, bleeding and bleeding, 
then lying for days, waxy, doll- 
like, and came out, back to me, 
saying it wasn’t my fault it 
wasn’t my fault . God! And 
Twink as good as dead. 

T HERE was a reception com- 
mittee waiting for us — two 
big names in medicine, McClin- 
tock and Zein — and, of course, 
Champlain. Busy boy. He 
wouldn’t miss this for the world. 
But, thank heavens, no press. 

' “Come on, I want to talk to 
you,” said Champlain, big, 
breezy as ever, looking like the 
world’s least likely suspect as a 
parapsychologist. I never did like 
Champlain, but he was the only 
person in the world besides Doris 
I could really talk to. At the mo- 
ment, I wished I hadn’t ever 
talked to him. Especially about 
Twink. But he knew and that 
was that. 

He muscled me away from 
Doris and Twink. 

“No!” cried Doris, and Twink 
was frightened. 



104 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Now don’t you worry, little 
lady; he’ll be back with you be- 
fore we do a thing,” he called 
heartily, and there I was going 
one way and Doris and Twink 
the other. What could I do? 

He pushed me through a door 
and I had the choice of sitting in 
a big armchair or falling down, 
the way he rushed me. He kicked 
the door shut. 

“Here’s some medicine.” He 
got a bottle out of the top desk 
drawer. “McClintock let me see 
where he put it, the fool.” 

“I don’t want any.” 

“Come on now.” 

“Get away from me,” I said, 
and meant it. Inside myself, I 
turned to admire that tone, harsh 
and rpugh and completely de- 
cisive. I’d always thought only 
movie gangsters could make a 
speech like that sound so real. 
And while I was backing off from 
myself, admiring, I suddenly 
sobbed and swore and swore and 
sobbed. It was pretty disgusting. 

“Wow,” said Champlain. He 
put the bottle down and got some 
pills. He filled a paper cup with 
ice-water and came over to me. 
“Take these.” 

“I don’t want any.” 

“You’ll take’m or I’ll hold your 
nose and ram ’em down your 
neck with a stick!” 

I took them and the water. As 
I keep saying, I’m no superman. 
“What are they?” 



“Dexamyl. Brighten you up, 
smooth you down all at once. 
Now tell me what’s the matter.” 
I said it, said what I hadn’t 
put in words before. “Twink’s 
going to die. I want her to.” 
“The two best specialists in 
the world say no.” 

“Let her die! She’s going out 
of here as a basket case if you 
don’t! I know. I know better’n 
anybody. Blind. Deaf. Paralyzed. 
All she can do is sort of flop. Let 
her die!” 

“Don’t be so goddam selfish.” 
A kick in the face would have 
shocked me a good deal less. I 
just gawked at him. 

“Sure, selfish,” he repeated. 
“You pulled a little bobble that 
anybody might have done and 
your wife won’t blame you for 
it. To you, it’s become a big, im- 
portant bobble because you never 
were involved in anything im- 
portant before. The only way you 
can prove it’s important is to 
suffer an important punishment. 
The worst thing you can think 
of is to have Twink dead. The 
next worse is to have her go 
through life the way she is now. 
You want one of those things.” 

CALLED him something. 
“Sure I am,” he agreed. 
“Absolutely. In the eyes of the 
guy who’s wrong, the guy who’s 
right is always just what you 
said.” 



TWINK 



105 



I used another one. 

“That, too,” he said, and 
beamed. 

I put up my hands and let 
them fall. “What do you want 
me to do? What are you picking 
on me for?” 

He came over and sat sideways 
on the broad arm of the chair. 
“I want you to get in there and 
help us. Help Twink.” 

“I’d be in the way.” 

He hit me on the shoulder- 
blade. It was done as a sort of 
friendly gesture, but it was done 
hard. “You can get through to 
her, can’t you?” 

“Yes.” 

“She’s been hurt. Badly. This is 
going to hurt her, too — a whole 
lot. She may not want to go 
through with it.” 

“She has a choice?” 

“Every patient has a choice. 
Other things being equal, they 
live or they don’t. If they’ve been 
hurt and they see more pain com- 
ing, they might not want to go 
through with it.” 

“I still don’t see how I — ” 
“Would you like to keep won- 
dering whether you could have 
saved her life?” 

“She’s going to die, anyway.” 
He got up and stood in front of 
me with his big fists on his hips, 
glaring at me silently until I had 
to raise my face. He held me with 
his eyes until I couldn’t stand it 
and then he said, rough and 



gentle like a tiger purring, “You 
damn near killed her once and 
now you want to finish the job. 
That it?” 

“All right, all right!” I shouted. 
“I’ll do it, I’ll do anything!” 
“Good!” And suddenly he 
dropped on one knee and took 
both of my hands in both of his. 
It was a very surprising thing for 
him to do and strangely effective. 
I could feel currents of his im- 
mense vitality from those big 
hands; it was as if my ego, wrink- 
led like a prune, was swelling up 
sleek and healthy. 

He said, softly and with deep 
earnestness, “All you’ve got to 
do is make her want to live. 
You’ve got to be with her and 
wait for her and help her along 
and keep her convinced that no 
matter what happens, no matter 
how it hurts, it’s worth it because 
she’s going to live.” 

“All right,” I whispered. 

“She’s only a little girl. She 
takes things just the way she finds 
them and she doesn’t make allow- 
ances. If something looks like 
fear to her, or anger, it is that. If 
something looks like love, or wis- 
dom, or strength, that’s just how 
she’ll take it.- Be strong and wise 
for her.” 

“Me?” 

He got up. “You.” He went 
to the desk and got the bottle and 
poured a paper cup full. He held 
it out to me.

I wiped my eyes with the backs 
of my hands and stood up. “No, 
thanks. I don’t need it,” I told 
him. 

He twitched his eyebrows and 
drank the liquor himself and we 
went out. 

npHEY put me through the 
-*• scrub room just as if I’d been 
a surgeon — gloves, mask and all 
— and then we went into the op- 
erating theater. Doris was already 
there, all fixed up, too. I went 
and kissed her right through the 
mask and she smiled. 

I said, “You look lovely in 
white,” and wondered where that 
had come from; and, “Hi-i, 
Twink.” 

Somewhere in the blindness, 
in the confines of paralysis, there 
was a shadow of fear and, down 
inside that, a warm little re- 
sponse. And the fear evaporated. 
I looked up and met Champlain’s 
eyes. That unnatural feeling under 
my mask was, to my complete 
astonishment, a grin. I nodded 
and he winked back and said, “I 
guess you can go ahead, Mac.” 

Now listen, Twink, I said with 
all my heart, I love you and I’m 
here. I’m right here with you no 
matter what happens. Some- 
thing’s going to happen, some- 
thing big, arid it’s going to change 
everything for you. Some of it 
won’t be . won’t be nice. But 
they have to do it. For you, 



Twink. Even when it isn’t nice, it’s 
for you. You’ve got to let them. 
You’ve got to help them. They 
love you, but I love you most 
of all. You mustn’t go away. If 
it hurts you too much, you just 
tell me and I’ll make them stop. 

Then something was the mat- 
ter, very much the matter- Shak- 
en, I crowded close and tried to 
see what McClintock was doing. 
“Back off a little,” he growled. 

“Back off, my eyeball. What 
the hell are you winding around 
her head?” 

Champlain barked at me, “Cut 
it out! The one thing you don’t 
get is angry!” 

Doris made a little sound. I 
spun to her. She was smiling. 
No, she wasn’t. Her eyes were 
all screwed up. A tear came out. 

“Doris!” 

Her face relaxed instantly, as 
if the nerves had been cut. Then 
she opened her eyes and looked 
at me. “I’m all right,” she said. 

There was a calling, a calling, 
a calling. 

All right, Twink, I’m here. I 
didn’t go away. I’m right here, 
honey. If you want them to stop, 
you just say so. 

A pause, then a tremulous ques- 
tioning. 

Yes, yes, I said, I’m here. Ev- 
ery single second. I’m not going 
away. Again the pause and then, 
like a flicker of light, a hot, glad 
little response. 



TWINK 



107 



Doris moaned, almost a whis- 
per. I shot a glance at her, then 
at Champlain. 

“You want that stopped?” he 
asked. 

“No,” I said. “I promised her 
she could.” 

Doris’s hand moved. I took it. 
It was wet. She squeezed mine, 
hard. 

Something from Twink, unlike 
anything I had ever experienced 
before. Except the accident. Yes, 
it was like the accident — and 
stop ! STOP! 

“Stop!” I gasped. “Stop it!” 

jY/fcCLINTOCK went right on 
working as if I hadn’t made 
a sound. The other specialist, 
Zein, said to Champlain as if I 
couldn’t hear, “Do we have to 
stand for this?” 

“You’re damn right you do,” 
said Champlain. 

Working, McClintock asked, 
“Stop? What do you mean, 
stop?” 

Zein mumbled something to 
him. McClintock nodded and a 
nurse came flying across the room 
with a tray of hypodermics. Mc- 
Clintock used a number of them. 

Twink went quiet. For a mo- 
ment, I thought I would faint 
from relief. 

All right, honey? All right? I 
made them stop. Twinkie. Is it 
all right? 

Twink! 



T wink! 

I made some sort of noise, I 
don’t know what. Champlain’s 
hands were on my shoulders, 
grinding down like two oversized 
C-clamps. I shrugged off one, 
knocked off the other with my 
wrist. “Twink!” I shouted. Then 
Doris screamed shrilly and Twink 
vibrated like a gong. 

“That won’t do,” I snapped, 
gesturing with my head. 

“Want her out?” 

“Don’t you dare,” said Doris. 

“Yes. Now.” 

McClintock began, “Who’s — ’’ 
but Champlain said, “Shut up. 
Take her out.” 

After that, it went very quickly. 

Just a little more, Twink, and 
it’ll be all over and you’ll be 
warm and comfy and you can 
sleep. And I’ll be near while you 
sleep and with you when you 
wake up. 

I tried to stop McClintock 
once more, when he took the little 
arm that had been immobilized 
across Twink’s chest for so long 
and twisted it brutally up and 
back. But this time Champlain 
was on McClintock’s side and he 
was right; the pain stopped al- 
most instantly. 

And then — was it weeks later, 
hours? The biggest part was over 
and they did things to her eyes, 
her mouth, while I found ways 
and yet new ways to thrust aside 
fury, ignore fatigue, negate fear. 



108

and press on and on and around 
and inside with I love you, 
Twink; I’m here; it’s all right. 
Just a little more, a little — there, 
it’s stopped. Are you all right, 
Twink? 

She was all right. She was won- 
derful. When they were through 
with her, she was weak and she 
looked like hell, but she was all 
right. I stared at her and stared 
at her and I couldn’t believe it; 
I couldn’t contain it, either. I 
didn’t know what to do. So I 
began to laugh. 

“Okay, let’s get out of here.” 
Champlain loomed over me like 
a grounded parachute. 

“Yeah, wait.” I sidled around 
him and went to McClintock. 
“Thanks,” I said. “I’m sorry.” 

“It’s okay,” he said tonelessly. 

Zein just turned his back. 

T SAT by the bed where they 
had put Doris, tired, and I 
waited. 

This was a lot different from 
that other hospital, that other 
time. Then I’d committed some- 
thing and I was full of fear. 
Now I’d accomplished something 
and I was full of hope — and 
liquor, but they tasted much the 
same. Twink was asleep, breath- 
ing beautiful even breaths, far 
too weary to be afraid. 

I was glad about so many 
things and I mentally thumbed 
through them all, one by one, 



with a huge and quiet delight. 
And I think that the one I was 
happiest about was my saying to 
Champlain afterward, “She’d 
have been perfectly all right even 
if I hadn’t been there.” 

What I was so pleased about 
was that I said it, I didn’t ask 
it. And he had laughed and filled 
my cup again. 

“You’re a mind-reader,” he 
said, and it was the first time I 
had ever heard that and thought 
it was funny. 

“You wanted a case history of 
a human being born with little or 
no birth trauma, you son.” 

“Well, nobody ever had one 
before,” he admitted. “I’d have 
had a lot less trouble in my 
young life if my dad had been 
able to paddle me down that par- 
ticular canal in a canoe.” 

“You’re a louse and it was 
worth it,” I’d told him. 

Doris turned her head impati- 
ently. 

“I’m here,” I whispered. 

She looked at me out of the 
same composed, porcelain face. 
“Hi. How’s your girl friend?” 

“My other girl friend. Doris, 
she’s beautiful! All pink. She has 
two eyes. Ten toes. Eight fingers.” 

“What?” 

“And two thumbs. She’s all 
right, darling, really all right. 
A perfectly normal newborn girl- 
baby.” 

“Oh, I’m ... so glad. Does

she . can you still — even after 
the Caesarean?” 

I nodded and in that split sec- 
ond, I wished my fool head had 
rolled right off. Because as I did 
it, I realized that I could have 
lied; she wanted me to. 

She began to cry. She said, 
“You made them knock me out 
and you did it all yourself. You’ve 
had her to talk to all this time 
and you always will, as long as 
you both live. I’ll never ever cry 
about this again, I promise, be- 
cause it’s not your fault and I 



love you, anyway. But I’m going 
to cry about it now.” 

I crouched with my head on 
her pillow for a long, long time. 
Then I went away, because she 
was nowhere near finished. 

She’s never cried about that 
since, though. 

Never once. 

I guess there’s some way a man 
can make up a thing like that 
to a woman. 

If he keeps looking. 

I guess.

FORECAST 

Next month, the Galaxy-Simon & Schuster $6,500 prize-winning novel, 
PREFERRED RISK by Edson McCann, comes to a literally sizzling conclusion. 
The will of the entire human race is probated all in one day . and yet 
there are heirs to inherit the whole planetary estate! Who are they? What 
trick did they have up their sleeves? If you miss the last installment, you'll 
never find out, so make sure you don't miss it! 

There will be at least one novelet . LITTLE ORPHAN ANDROID by 
James E. Gunn, which turns up a question that has never been explored: 
Anybody can get a divorce, win a pardon from prison, go into bankruptcy 
or find a way out of trouble. But those are cinches compared with the 
problem of coping with this lab-made bundle of exasperating confusions 
and paradoxes! 

And, of course, short stories; Willy Ley's FOR YOUR INFORMATION, in 
which he strips some veils from the mystery planet; and FIVE STAR SHELF 
returns . just in case you were wondering what became of it. 

Perhaps, like us, you've been curious about the reaction to PREFERRED 
RISK. Just on the basis of the first two installments, there seems little doubt 
that this serial will join the exalted company of THE PUPPET MASTERS, 
GRAVY PLANET, THE DEMOLISHED MAN and other trail-blazing novels 
you've read in these pages, for it has been received with great enthusiasm. 
Let's hear what you think, eh?

PREFERRED RISK 

PART 3 OF A 4-PART SERIAL 

By EDSON McCANN 

If a planet is insured from pre-cradle to post-grave, somebody 
must be the beneficiary — and Wills had to find out who it was! 

Illustrated by KOSSIN 



SYNOPSIS 

1 AM Thomas Wills, trying 
to build a new life out of the 
wreckage my wife’s death 
made of the old one. Everything 
is new, everything is different — 
my dull, comfortable world died 
with her and I find myself in 
romantic, war-ravaged Naples, on 
an errand of high adventure in 
the service of — 



The Company, the giant com- 
bine of insurance corporations 
which protects the world by in- 
suring every one of its activities. 
It is the finest work of mankind; 
the Company has once and for 
all called a halt to war, poverty, 
disease and danger, by the most 
modern application of actuarial 
methods. Everyone knows this to

be true; they read it in their daily 
newspapers ( Company owned ), 
they learn it in their schools and 
colleges ( Company financed ). 
But in Naples I find a shock: 
There are subversives who doubt 
it. Among them is a beautiful girl 
named — 

Rena dell’Angela, who re- 
minds me that Naples has just 
fought a war, who tells me that 
she and her father are in want 
because they oppose the Com- 
pany, who points out that my 
wife, Marianna, died of a prevent- 
able disease. I am confused by 
her subversive arguments, but 
even more confused by the girl 
herself — because I begin to sus- 
pect that I am in love with her. 
Her father — 

Benedetto dell’Angela, is a 
“ward” of the Company — actu- 
ally, says Rena, a prisoner. He is 
in suspended animation in the 
enormous, refrigerated Company 
vaults called — 

The Clinics. In these places, 
persons suffering from incurable 
diseases are kept until such time 
as medical scientists can devise 
a cure. But Rena says they are 
prisons; and the fact that her 
father, a perfectly healthy indi- 
vidual, is there seems to be proof. 
Another involuntary “ward” is a 
strange man named — 

Luigi Zorchi, who makes his 
career of collecting on accident 
claims. There is no fraud in- 

114 



volved; when he collects damages 
for a lost limb, the limb is actu- 
ally lost — but Zorchi, mysteri- 
ously, can regrow a severed 
member like a starfish! All this 
is unbearably confusing; but 
when things look their worst, I 
have good news. Straight from 
the Home Office comes — 

Underwriter Defoe, a high 
executive of the Company and 
my deceased wife’s distant rela- 
tive, who got me the coveted 
Naples assignment in the first 
place. I look to him not only to 
straighten out my confusion, but 
to end the dry rot that has in- 
fected The Company’s entire 
operation in Naples, from the 
lowest clerks to the Regional 
Director — 

Gogarty, a slothful lard tub of 
a man, given more to fast living 
than to carrying out the Com- 
pany’s urgent business. But Defoe 
in Naples is a different man than 
the Defoe I used to know in the 
Home Office. 

I begin to suspect that perhaps 
the contentions of the dell’An- 
gelas are true, and the Company 
is indeed a corrupt and cynical 
power combine! In any case, it 
is clear that Zorchi and Bene- 
detto dell’Angela are wrongfully 
imprisoned. I help Rena free 
them and we flee to Rome — 
fugitives from everything I have 
been taught to love and respect 
and live for!

R ENA craned her neck around 
the door and peered into the 
nave of the church. “He’s kissing 
the Book,” she reported. “It will 
be perhaps twenty minutes yet.” 
Her father said mildly, “I am 
in no hurry. It is good to rest 
here. Though truthfully, Mr. 
Wills, I thought I had been rested 
sufficiently by your Company.” 

I think we were all grateful 
for the rest. It had been a hectic 
drive up from Anzio. Even 
though Rena’s “friends” were 
thoughtful people, they had not 
anticipated that we would have 
a legless man with us. 

They had passports for Rena 
and myself and Benedetto; for 
Zorchi they had none. It had 
been necessary for him to hide 
under a dirty tarpaulin in the 
trunk of the ancient charcoal- 
burning car, while Rena charmed 
the Swiss Guards at the border. 
And it was risky. But the Guards 
charmed easily, and we got 
through. 

Zorchi did not much appreciate 
it. He swore a ragged blue streak 
when we stopped in the shade of 
an olive grove and lugged him 
to the front seat again, and he 
didn’t stop swearing until we hit 
the Appian Way. When the old 
gas-generator limped up a hill, 
he swore at its slowness; when 
it whizzed along the downgrades 



and level stretches, he swore at 
the way he was being bounced 
around. 

I didn’t regret rescuing Zorchi 
from the clinic — it was a matter 
of simple justice since I had 
helped trick him into it. But I 
did wish that it had been some 
more companionable personality 
that I had been obligated to. 

Benedetto, on the other hand, 
shook my hand and said: “For 
God, I thank you,” and I felt well 
repaid. But he was in the back 
seat being brought up to date by 
his daughter; I had the honor of 
Zorchi’s company next to me. 

There was a long Latin period 
from the church, a response from 
the altar boy, and then the final 
Ite, missa est. We heard the wor- 
shipers moving out of the church. 

The priest came through the 
room we were waiting in, his 
robes swirling. He didn’t look 
around, or give any sign that he 
knew we were there, though he 
almost stepped on Zorchi, sitting 
propped against a wall. 

A moment later, another man 
in vaguely clerical robes entered 
and nodded to us. “Now we go 
below,” he ordered. 

Benedetto and I flanked Zorchi 
and carried him, an arm around 
each of our necks. We followed 
the sexton, or whatever he was, 
back into the church, before the 
altar — Benedetto automatically 
genuflected with the others, near-

ly making me spill Zorchi onto 
the floor — to a tapestry-hung 
door. He pushed aside the tapes- 
try, and a cool, musty draft came 
up from darkness. 

The sexton lit a taper with a 
pocket cigarette lighter and led 
us down winding, rickety steps. 
There was no one left in the 
church to notice us; if anyone 
had walked in, we were tourists, 
doing as countless millions of 
tourists had done before us over 
the centuries.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



We were visiting the Cata- 
combs. 

A ROUND us were the bones 
of the Christians of a very 
different Rome. Rena had told 
me about them : How they 

rambled under the modern city, 
the only entrances where 
churches had been built over 
them. How they had been nearly 
untouched for two thousand 
years. I even felt a little as 
though I really were a tourist as 
we descended, she had made me 
that curious to see them. 

But I was disappointed. We 
lugged the muttering Zorchi 
through the narrow, musty corri- 
dors, with the bones of martyrs 
at our elbows, in the flickering 
light of the taper, and I had the 
curious feeling that I had been 
there before. 

As, in a way, I had: I had 
been in the vaults of the Com- 
pany’s clinic at Anzio, in some 
ways very closely resembling 
these Catacombs — 

Even to the bones of the mar- 
tyrs. 

I was almost expecting to see 
plastic sacks. 

We picked our way through 
the warrens for several minutes, 
turning this way and that. I was 
lost in the first minute. Then the 
sexton stopped before a flat stone 
that had a crude, faded sketch 
of a fish on it; he leaned on it, 



and the stone discovered itself 
to be a door. We followed him 
through it into a metal-walled, 
high-ceilinged tunnel, utterly un- 
like the meandering Catacombs. 
I began to hear sounds; we went 
through another door, and light 
struck at our eyes. 

I blinked and focused on a 
long room, half a dozen yards 
wide, almost as tall, at least fifty 
yards long. It appeared to be a 
section of an enormous tunnel; 
it appeared to be, and it was. 
Benedetto and I set Zorchi — 
still cursing — down on the floor 
and stared around. 

There were people in the tun- 
nel, dozens of them. There were 
desks and tables and file cabinets; 
it looked almost like any branch 
of the Company, with whirring 
mimeographs and clattering type- 
writers. 

The sexton pinched out the 
taper and dropped it on the floor, 
as people came toward us. 

“So now you are in our head- 
quarters in Rome,” said the man 
dressed as a sexton. “It is good 
to see you again, Benedetto.” 

“And it is much better to see 
you, Slovetski,” the old man an- 
swered warmly. 

T HIS man Slovetski — I do 
not think I can say what he 
looked like. 

He was, I found, the very lead- 
er of the “friends,” the monarch 



PREFERRED RISK 



117 



of this underground headquar- 
ters. But he was a far cry from 
the image I had formed of a 
bearded agitator. There was a 
hint of something bright and fear- 
ful in his eyes, but his voice was 
warm and deep, his manner was 
reassuring, his face was friendly. 
Still — there was that cat-spark 
in his eyes. 

Slovetski, that first day, gave 
me an hour of his time. He an- 
swered some of my questions ■ — - 
not all. The ones he smiled at, 
and shook his head, were about 
numbers and people. The ones he 
answered were about principles 
and things. 

He would tell me, for instance, 
what he thought of the Company 
— endlessly. But he wouldn’t say 
how many persons in the world 
were his followers. He wouldn’t 
name any of the persons who 
were all around us. But he gladly 
told me about the place itself. 

“History, Mr. Wills,” he said 
politely. “History tells a man 
everything he needs to know. You 
look in the books, and you will 
learn of Mussolini, when this 
peninsula was all one state; he 
lived in Rome, and he started a 
subway. The archives even have 
maps. It is almost all abandoned 
now. Most of it was never fin- 
ished. But the shafts are here, 
and the wiring that lights us still 
comes from the electric mains.” 

“And the only entrance is 



through the Catacombs?” 

The spark gleamed bright in 
his eye for a second. Then he 
shrugged. “Why shouldn’t I tell 
you? No. There are several 
others, but they are not all con- 
venient.” He chuckled. “For in- 
stance, one goes through a sta- 
tion on the part of the subway 
that is still in operation. But it 
would not have done for you, you 
see; Rena could not have used it. 
It goes through the gentlemen’s 
washroom.” 

We chuckled, Slovetski and I. 
I liked him. He looked like what 
he once had been: a history 

teacher in a Company school, 
somewhere in Europe. We talked 
about History, and Civilization, 
and Mankind, and all the other 
capitalized subjects. He was very 
didactic and positive in what he 
said, just like a history teacher. 
But he was understanding. He 
made allowances for my back- 
ground; he did not call me a 
fool. He was a patient monk in- 
structing a novice in the mys- 
teries of the order, and I was at 
ease with him. 

But there was still that spark 
in his eye. 

Rena disappeared almost as 
soon as we were safely in the 
tunnels. Benedetto was around, 
but he was as busy as Slovetski, 
and just as mysterious about 
what occupied him. So I had for 
company Zorchi.

We had lunch. “Food!” he said, 
and the word was an epithet. 
“They offer this to me for food! 
For pigs, Weels. Not for Zorchi!” 
He pushed the plate away from 
him and stared morosely at the 
table. 

We were given a room to share, 
and one of Slovetski’s men fixed 
up a rope-and-pulley affair so 
Zorchi could climb into his bed 
unaided. He was used to the help 
of a valet; the first time he tried 
it, he slipped and fell on the 
stumps of his legs. It must have 
hurt. > 

He shrieked, “Assassins! All of 
them! They put me in a kennel 
with the apprentice assassin, and 
the other assassins make a guillo- 
tine for me to kill myself on!” 

We had a long talk with 
Slovetski, on the ideals and prin- 
ciples of his movement. Zorchi 
stared mutinously at the wall. I 
found the whole thing very in- 
teresting — shocking, but inter- 
esting. But Zorchi was immune 
to shock — “Perhaps it is news 
to you, Weels, that the Company 
is a big beast?” — and he was 
interested in nothing in all the 
world but Zorchi. 

By the end of the second day 
I stopped talking to him entirely. 
It wasn’t kind. He disliked me, 
but he hated everyone else in the 
tunnel, so he had no one to talk 
to. But it -was either that or hit 
him in the face, and — although 



many of my mores had changed 
overnight — I still did not think 
I could strike a man without legs. 

And besides, the less I saw of 
Zorchi, the more time I had to 
think about Rena. 

S HE returned on the third day, 
without a word of explanation 
to me of where she had been or 
what she had done. She greeted 
me and disappeared again, this 
time only for hours. Then she 
came back and said, “Now I am 
through, for a time. How have 
you liked our little hideaway?” 

I said, “It gets lonesome.” 
“Lonesome?” Her brown eyes 
were wide and perfectly serious. 
“I had thought it would be other- 
wise, Tom. So many of us in this 
little space, how could you be 
lonesome?” 

I took her hand. “I’m not lone- 
some now,” I told her. We found 
a place to sit in a corner of the 
communal dining hall. Around us 
the life of the underground move- 
ment buzzed and swirled. It was 
much like a branch of the Com- 
pany, as I have said; the work 
of this secret section seemed to 
be mostly a record-keeping de- 
pot for the activities that took 
place on the surface. But no one 
paid much attention to Rena and 
me. 

What did we talk about? What 
couples have always talked 
about : Each other, and every-

thing, and nothing. The only 
thing we did not talk about was 
my basic beliefs in regard to the 
Company. For I was too troubled 
in my mind to talk about them, 
and Rena sensitive enough not 
to bring them up. 

For I had, with all honor, 
sworn an oath of allegiance to 
the Company; and I had not kept 
it. 

I could not, even then, see any 
possibility of a world where the 
Company did not exist. For what 
the Company said of itself was 
true: Before the Company exist- 
ed, men lived like beasts. There 
was always the instant danger of 
war and disease. No plan could 
be made, no hope could be held, 
that could not be wiped out by 
blind accident. 

And yet, were men better off 
today? I could not doubt the 
truths I had been told. The Com- 
pany permitted wars — I had 
seen it. The Company permitted 
disease — my own wife had died. 

Somewhere there was an an- 
swer, but I couldn’t find it. It was 
not, I was sure, in Slovetski’s 
burning hatred of everything the 
Company stood for. But it could 
not be, either, in the unquestion- 
ing belief that I had once given. 

But my views, it turned out, 
hardly mattered any more; the 
die was cast. Benedetto appeared 
in the entrance to the dining hall, 
peering about. He saw us and 

120 



came over, his face grave. 

“I am sorry, Mr. Wills,” he 
said. “I have been listening to 
Radio Napoli. It has just come 
over the air: A description of 
you, and an order for your arrest. 
The charge is — murder!” 

I GAPED at him, hardly believ- 
ing. “Murder! But that’s not 
true; I certainly never — ” 

Benedetto laid a hand on my 
shoulder. “Of course not, Mr. 
Wills. It is a fiction of the Com- 
pany’s, beyond doubt. But it is 
a fiction that may cause your 
death if you are discovered, do 
not doubt that.” 

I swallowed. “Who — whom 
did I murder?” 

Benedetto shrugged. “I do not 
know who he is. The name they 
gave was Elio Barletteria.” 

That was the suspendee whose 
place Zorchi had usurped. I sat 
back, bewildered. It was true, at 
least, that I had had some con- 
nection with the man. But — kill 
him? Was it possible, I asked 
myself, that the mere act of tak- 
ing him out of his plastic sack 
endangered his life? I doubted it, 
but still — 

I asked Benedetto. He frowned. 
“It is — possible,” he admitted 
at last. “We do not know much 
about the suspendees, Mr. Wills. 
The Company has seen to that. It 
is my opinion — only an opinion, 
I am afraid — that if this man 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Barletteria is dead, it had nothing 
to do with anything you did. 
Still — ” he shrugged — “what 
difference does it make? If the 
Company calls you a murderer, 
you must be one, for the Com- 
pany is always right. Is that not 
so?” 

We left it at that, but I was 
far from easy in my mind. The 
dining hall filled, and we ate our 
evening meal, but I hardly no- 
ticed what I ate and I took no 
part in the conversation. Rena 
and her father considerately left 
me alone; Zorchi was, it seemed, 
sulking in our room, for he did 
not appear. But I was not con- 
cerned with him, for I had 
troubles of my own. I should have 
been. 

After dinner was over, I ex- 
cused myself and went to the 
tiny cubicle that had been as- 
signed to Zorchi and myself. He 
wasn’t there. Then I began to 
think: Would Zorchi miss a meal? 

The answer was unquestion- 
ably no. With his metabolism, he 
needed many times the food of 
an ordinary person; his perform- 
ance at table, in fact, was spec- 
tacular. 

Something was wrong. I was 
shaken out of my self-absorption; 
I hurried to find Benedetto dell’- 
Angela, and told him that Zorchi 
was gone. 

It didn’t take long for us to 
find the answer. The underground 



hideout was not large; it had only 
so many exits. It was only a mat- 
ter of moments before one of the 
men Benedetto had ordered to 
search returned with an alarmed 
expression. 

The exit that led through the 
subway station was ajar. Some- 
how Zorchi had hitched himself, 
on his stumps, down the long 
corridor and out the exit. It had 
to be while -we were eating; he 
could never have made it except 
when everyone was in one room. 

How he had done it did not 
matter. The fact remained that 
Zorchi was gone and, with him, 
the secrecy of our hiding place. 

X 

YV7"E HAD to move. There was 
no way out of it. 

“Zorchi hates the Company,” I 
protested. “I don’t think he’ll go 
to them and — ” 

“No, Wills.” Slovetski patient- 
ly shook his head. “We can’t take 
a chance. If we had been able to 
recapture him, then we could 
stay here. But he got clean away.” 
There was admiration in his eyes. 
“What a conspirator he would 
have made! Such strength and 
determination! Think of it, Wills, 
a legless man in the city of Rome. 
He cannot avoid attracting atten- 
tion. He can barely move by 
himself. And yet, our men track 
him into the subway station, to

a telephone . and that is all. 
Someone picks him up. Who? A 
friend, one supposes — certainly 
not the Company, or they would 
have been here before this. But 
to act so quickly, Wills!” 

Benedetto dell’Angela coughed. 
“Perhaps more to the point, 
Slovetski, is how quickly we our- 
selves shall now act.” 

Slovetski grinned. “All is 
ready,” he promised. “See, evacu- 
ation already has begun!” 

Groups of men were quickly 
placing file folders into cartons 
and carrying them off. They were 
not going far, I found later, only 
to a deserted section of the an- 
cient Roman Catacombs, from 
which they could be retrieved 
and transported, little by little, 
at a later date. 

By sundown, Rena and I were 
standing outside the little church 
which contained the entrance to 
the Catacombs. The two of us 
went together; only two. It would 
look quite normal, it was agreed, 
for a young man and a girl to 
travel together, particularly after 
my complexion had been suitably 
stained and my Company clothes 
discarded and replaced with a 
set of Rome’s best ready-to- 
wears. 

It did not occur to me at the 
time, but Rena must have known 
that her own safety was made 
precarious by being with me. 
Rena alone had nothing to fear, 



even if she had been caught and 
questioned by an agent of the 
Company. They would suspect 
her, because of her father, but 
suspicion would do her no harm. 
But Rena in the company of a 
wanted “murderer” — and one 
traveling in disguise — was far 
less safe. 

We found an ancient piston- 
driven cab and threaded through 
almost all of Rome. We spun 
around the ancient stone hulk of 




... 122 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the Colosseum, passed the bal- 
cony where a sign stated the dic- 
tator, Mussolini, used to harangue 
the crowds, and climbed a wind- 
ing, expensive-looking street to 
the Borghese Gardens. 

Rena consulted her watch. 
“We’re early;” she said. We had 
gelati in an open-air pavilion, 
listening to the wheezing of a 
sweating band; then, in the twi- 
light, we wandered hand in hand 
under trees for half an hour. 




Then Rena Said, “Now it is 
time.” We walked to the far end 
of the Gardens where a small 
copter-field served the Class-A 
residential area of Rome. A dozen 
copters were lined up at the end 
of the take-off hardstand. Rena 
led me to the nearest of them. 

I looked at it casually, and 
stopped dead. 

“Rena!” I whispered violently. 
“Watch out!” The copter was 
black and purple; it bore on its 
flank the marking of the Swiss 
Guard, the Roman police force. 

S HE pressed my hand. “Poor 
Tom,” she said. She walked 
boldly up to one of the officers 
lounging beside the copter and 
spoke briefly to him, too low for 
tne to hear. 

It was only when the big vanes 
overhead had sucked us a hun- 
dred yards into the air, and we 
were leveling off and heading 
south, that she said: “These are 
friends too, you see. Does it sur- 
prise you?” 

I swallowed, staring at the 
hissing jets at the ends of the 
swirling vanes. “Well,” I said, “I’m 
not exactly surprised, but I 
thought that your friends were, 
well, more likely to be — ” 

“To be rabble?” I -started to 
protest, but she was not angry. 
She was looking at me with gen- 
tle amusement. “Still you believe, 
Tom. Deep inside you: An enemy 



PREFERRED RISK 



123 



of the Company must be, at the 
best, a silly zealot like my father 
and me — and at the worst, 
rabble.” She laughed as I started 
to answer her. “No, Tom, if 
you are right, you should not 
deny it; and if you are wrong — 
you will see.” 

I sat back and stared, dis- 
gruntled, at the purple sunset 
over the Mediterranean. I never 
saw such a girl for taking the 
wind out of your sails. 

O NCE across the border, the 
Guards had no status, and it 
was necessary for them to swing 
inland, threading through moun- 
tains and passes, remaining as in- 
conspicuous as possible. 

It was little more than an 
hour’s flight until I found land- 
marks I could recognize. To our 
right was the bright bowl of 
Naples; far to our left, the eerie 
glow that, marked bombed-out 
New Caserta. And ahead, barely 
visible, the faint glowing plume 
that hung over Mount Vesuvius. 

Neither Rena nor the Guards 
spoke, but I could feel in their 
tense attitudes that this was the 
danger-point. We were in the lair 
of the enemy. Undoubtedly we 
were being followed in a hundred 
radars, and the frequency-pattern 
would reveal our copter for what 
it was — a Roman police plane 
that had no business in that area. 
Even if the Company let us pass, 



there was always the chance that 
some Neapolitan radarman, more 
efficient, or more anxious for a 
promotion, than his peers would 
alert an interceptor and order us 
down. Certainly, in the old days, 
interception would have been in- 
evitable; for Naples had just com- 
pleted a war, and only short 
weeks back an unidentified air- 
craft would have been blasted 
out of the sky. 

But we were ignored. 

And that, I thought to myself, 
was another facet to the paradox. 
For when, in all the world’s years 
before these days of the Company, 
was there such complacency, 
such deep-rooted security, that a 
nation just out of a war should 
have soothed its combat-jangled 
nerves overnight? Perhaps the 
Company had not ended wars. 
But the fear of wars was utterly 
gone. 

We fluttered once around the 
volcano, and dipped in to a land- 
ing on a gentle hump of earth 
halfway up its slope, facing 
Naples and the Bay. We were a 
few hundred yards from a cluster 
of buildings — perhaps a dozen, 
in all. 

I jumped out, stumbling and 
recovering myself. Rena stepped 
lightly into my arms. And with- 
out a word, the Guards fed fuel 
to the jets, the rotor whirled, and 
the copter lifted away from us 
and was gone.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Rena peered about us, getting 
her bearings. There was a sliver 
of a moon in the eastern sky, 
enough light to make it possible 
to get about. She pointed to a 
dark hulk of a building far up 
the slope. “The Observatory. 
Come, Tom.” 

T HE volcanic soil was rich, but 
not very useful to farmers. 
It was not only the question of 
an eruption of the cone, for that 
sort of hazard was no different in 
kind than the risk of hailstorm 
or drought. But the mountain 
sides did not till easily, its vol- 
canic slopes being perhaps 
steeper than those of most moun- 
tains. 

The ground under our feet had 
never been in cultivation. It was 
pitted and rough, and grown up 
in a tangle of unfamiliar weeds. 
And it was also, I discovered 
with considerable shock, warm to 
the touch. 

I saw a plume of vapor, faintly 
silver in the weak light, hovering 
over a hummock. Mist, I thought. 
Then it occurred to me that there 
was too much wind for mist. It 
was steam! I touched the soil. 
Blood heat, at least. 

I said, with some difficulty, 
“Rena, look!” 

She laughed. “Oh, it is an erup- 
tion, Tom. Of course it is. But not 
a new one. It is lava, you see, 
from the little blast the Sicilians 



touched off. Do not worry about 
it. .” 

We clambered over the slip- 
pery cogs of a funicular railway 
and circled the ancient stone base 
of the building she had pointed 
to. There was no light visible; 
but Rena found a small door, 
rapped on it and presently it 
opened. 

Out of the darkness came 
Slovetski’s voice: “Welcome.” 

Once this building had been 
the Royal Vulcanological Ob- 
servatory of the Kingdom of 
Italy. Now it was a museum on 
the surface, and underneath an- 
other of the hideouts of Rena’s 
“friends.” 

But this was a hideout some- 
what more important than the 
one in the Roman Catacombs, I 
found. Slovetski made no bones 
about it. 

He said, “Wills, you shouldn’t 
be here. We don’t know you. We 
can’t trust you.” He held up a 
hand. “I know that you rescued 
dell’Angela. But that could all be 
an involved scheme of the Com- 
pany. You could be a Company 
spy. You wouldn’t be the first, 
Wills. And this particular installa- 
tion is, shall I say, important. 
You may even find why, though 
I hope not. If we hadn’t had to 
move so rapidly, you would 
never have been brought here. 
Now you’re here, though, and 
we’ll make the best of it.” He 



PREFERRED RISK 



125 



looked at me carefully, then, and 
the glinting spark in the back of 
his eyes flared wickedly for a 
moment. “Don’t try to leave. And 
don’t go anywhere in this build- 
ing where Rena or dell’ Angela or 
I don’t take you.” 

And that was that. I found 
myself assigned to the usual sort 
of sleeping accommodations I 
had come to expect in this group. 
Underground — cramped — and 
a bed harder than the Class-C 
Blue Heaven minimum. 

T HE next morning, Rena 
breakfasted with me, just the 
two of us in a tower room look- 
ing down over the round slope 
of Vesuvius and the Bay be- 
neath. She said:- “The museum 
has been closed since the bomb 
landed near, so you can roam 
around the exhibits if you wish. 
There are a couple of caretakers, 
but they’re with us. The rest of 
us will be in conference. I’ll try 
to see you for lunch.” 

And she conducted me to an 
upper level of the Observatory 
and left me by myself. I had my 
orders — stay in the public area 
of the museum. I didn’t like them. 
I wasn’t used to being treated 
like a small boy, left by his 
mother in a Company day nurs- 
ery while she busied herself with 
the important and incomprehen- 
sible affairs of adults. 

Still, the museum was interest- 

126 



ing enough, in a way. It had been 
taken over by the Company, it 
appeared, and although the leg- 
end frescoed around the main 
gallery indicated that it was sup- 
posed to be a historical museum 
of the Principality of Naples, it 
appeared by examination of the 
exhibits that the “history” in- 
volved was that of Naples vis-a- 
vis the Company. 

Not, of course, that such an 
approach was entirely unfair. If 
it had not been for the interven- 
tion of the Company, after the 
Short War, it is more than possi- 
ble that Naples as an independ- 
ent state would never have 
existed. 

It was the Company’s insist- 
ence on the dismantling of power 
centers (as Millen Carmody him- 
self had described it) that had 
created Naples and Sicily and 
Prague and Quebec and Baja 
California and all the others. 

Only the United States had 
been left alone — and that, I 
think, only because nobody dared 
to operate on a wounded tiger. 
In the temper of the nation after 
the Short War, the Company 
would have survived less than a 
minute if it had proposed sever- 
ing any of the fifty-one states. 

The museum was interesting 
enough, for anyone with a taste 
for horrors. It showed the changes 
in Neapolitan life over the past 
century or so. There was a re- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



construction of a typical Nea- 
politan home of the early Nine- 
teen-forties: a squalid hovel, 

packed ten persons to the room, 
with an American G.I., precursor 
of the Company expediters, 
spraying DDT into the bedding. 
There was, by comparison, a 
typical Class-B Blue Heaven 
modern allotment — with a cer- 
tain amount of poetic license; 
few Class-B homes really had 
polyscent showers and auto- 
cooks. 

I T WAS the section on warfare, 
however, that was most im- 
pressive. It was in the far back 
of the building, in a large cham- 
ber anchored to bedrock. It held 
a frightening display of weapons, 
from a Tiger Tank to a gas-gun. 
Bulking over everything else in 
the room, even the tank, was the 
thirty-foot height of a Hell-bomb 
in a four-story display. I looked 
at it a second time, vaguely dis- 
turbed by something I hadn’t 
Juite placed — an indigo gleam 
to the metal of the warhead, with 
a hint of evil under its lacquered 
sheen. 

It was cobalt. I bent to read 
the legend: This is the casing of 
the actual cobalt bomb that 
would have been used on Wash- 
ington if the Short War had 
lasted one more day. It is calcu- 
lated that, loaded with a Mark 
XII hydrogen-lithium bomb, suf- 



ficient radioactive Cobalt- 60 

would have been transmuted to 
end all life on Earth within thirty 
days. 

I looked at it again, shudder- 
ing. 

Oh, it was safe enough now. 
Until the hydrogen reaction could 
turn the ordinary cobalt sheath- 
ing into the deadly isotope-60, it 
was just such stuff as was used 
to alloy magnets and make cobalt 
glass. It was even more valuable 
as a museum piece than as the 
highly purified metal. 

Score one for the Company. 
They’d put a stop to that danger. 
Nobody would have a chance to 
arm it and send it off now. No 
small war would find it more 
useful than the bomb it would 
need — and no principality 
would risk the Company’s wrath 
in using it. And while the con- 
spiracy might have planes and 
helicopters, the fissionable ma- 
terial was too rigidly under Com- 
pany control for them to have a 
chance. The Super Hell-bomb 
would never go off. And that was 
something that might mean more 
to the Company’s credit than 
anything else. 

Maybe it was possible that in 
this controversy both sides were 
right. And, of course, there was 
the obvious corollary. 

I continued my wandering, 
looking at the exhibits, the rub- 
ble of the museum’s previous his- 



P REFERRED RISK

tory. The cast of the Pompeiian 
gladiator, caught by the cinder- 
fall in full flight, his straining 
body reproduced to every con- 
torted line by the incandescent 
ashes that had encased him. The 
carefully chipped and labeled 
samples from the lava flows of 
the past two centuries. The awe- 
inspiring photographs of Vesu- 
vius in eruption. 

But something about the bomb 
casing kept bothering me. I 
wandered around a bit longer 
and then turned back to the main 
exhibit. The big casing stretched 
upward and downward, with nar- 
row stairs leading down to the 
lower level at its base. It was on 
the staircase I’d noticed some- 
thing before. Now I hesitated, 
trying to spot whatever it was. 
There was a hint of something 
down there. Finally, I shrugged 
and went down to inspect it more 
closely. 

T YING at the base was a heavy 
radiation glove. A used, work- 
man’s glove, dirty with grease. 
And as my eyes darted up, I 
could see that the bolts on the 
lower servicing hatches were half- 
unscrewed. 

Radiation gloves and tamper- 
ing with the casing! 

There were two doors to the 
pit for the bomb casing, but 
either one was better than risk- 
ing the stairs again where some- 



one might see me. Or so I figured. 
If they found I’d learned any- 
thing. 

I grabbed for the nearer door, 
threw it open. I knew it was a 
mistake when the voice reached 
my ears. 

“ — after hitting the Home 
office with a Thousand-kiloton 
bomb. It’s going to take fast work. 
Now the schedule I’ve figured out 
so far — - God’s damnation! How 
did you get in here, Wills?” 

It was Slovetski, leaning across 
a table, staring at me. Around the 
table were Benedetto and four 
or five others I did not recognize. 
All of them looked at me as 
though I were the Antichrist, 
popped out of the marble at St. 
Peter’s Basilica on Easter Sun- 
day. 

The spark was a raging flame 
in Slovetski’s eyes. Benedetto 
dell’Angela said sharply, “Wait!” 
He strode over to me, half shield- 
ing me from Slovetski. “Explain 
this, Thomas,” he demanded. 

“I thought -this was the hall 
door,” I stammered, spilling the 
first words I could while I tried 
to find any excuse. 

“Wills! I tell you, answer me!” 

I said, “Look, did you expect 
me to carry a bell and cry un- 
clean? I didn’t mean to break in. 
I’ll go at once. .” 

In a voice that shook, Slovet- 
ski said: “Wait one moment.” He 
pressed a bell-button on the wall; 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



we all stood there silent, the five 
of them staring at me, me wishing 
I was dead. 

There was a patter of feet out- 
side, and Rena peered in. She 
saw me and her hand went to 
her heart. 

“Tom! But — ” 

Slovetski said commandingly, 
“Why did you permit him his 
liberty?” 

Rena looked at him wide-eyed. 
“But, please, I asked you. You 
suggested letting him study the 
exhibits.” 

Benedetto nodded. “True, 
Slovetski,” he said gravely. “You 
ordered her to attend until our 
— conference was over.” 

The flame surged wildly in 
Slovetski’s eyes — not at me. But 
he got it under control. He said, 
“Take him away.” He did not 
do me the courtesy of looking 
my way again. Rena took me by 
the hand and led me off, closing 
the door behind us. 

As soon as we were outside, I 
heard a sharp babble of argument, 
but I could make out no words 
through the door. I didn’t need 
to; I knew exactly what they were 
saying. 

This was the proposition: Re- 
solved, that the easiest thing to 
do is put Wills out oi the way 
permanently. And with Slovet- 
ski’s fiery eyes urging the posi- 
tive, what eager debater would 
say him nay? 



R ENA said: “I can’t tell you, 
Tom. Please don’t ask me!” 

I said, “This is no kid’s game, 
Rena! They’re talking about 
bombing the Home Office!” 

She shook her head. “Tom, 
Tom. You must have misunder- 
stood.” 

“I heard them!” 

“Tom, please don’t ask me any 
more questions.” 

I slammed my hand down on 
the table and swore. It didn’t do 
any good. She didn’t even look 
up from the remains of her 
dinner. 

It had been like that all after- 
noon. The Great Ones brooded 
in secret. Rena and I waited in 
her room, until the museum’s 
public visiting hours were over 
and we could go up into the freer 
atmosphere of the reception 
lounge. And then we waited 
there. 

I said mulishly: “Ever since I 
met you, Rena, I’ve been doing 
nothing but wait. I’m not built 
that way!” 

No answer. 

I said, with all of my patience: 
“Rena, I heard them talking 
about bombing the Home Office. 
Do you think I am going to 
forget that?” 

Leadenly: “No, Tom.” 

“So what does it matter if you 
tell me more? If I cannot be 
trusted, I already know too much. 
If I can be trusted, what does it 



PREFERRED RISK 



129 



matter if I know the rest?” 

Again tears. “Please don’t ask 
me!” 

I yelled: “At least you can 
tell me what we’re waiting for!” 

She dabbed at her eyes. “Please, 
Tom, I don’t know much more 
than you do. Slovetski, he is like 
this sometimes. He gets, I sup- 
pose you would say, thoughtful. 
He concentrates so very much on 
one thing, you see, that he for- 
gets everything around him. It is 
possible that he has forgotten 
that we are waiting. I don’t 
know.” 

I snarled, “I’m tired of this. Go 
in and remind him!” 

“No, Tom!” There was fright 
in her voice; and I found that she 
had told me one of the things I 
wanted to know. If it was not 
wise to remind Slovetski that I 
was waiting his pleasure, the 
probability was that it would not 
be pleasant for me when he re- 
membered. 

I said, “But you must know 
something, Rena. Don’t you see 
that it could do no harm to tell 
me?” 

She said miserably, “Tom, I 
know very little. I did not — did 
not know as much as you found 
out.” I stared at her. She nodded. 
“I had perhaps a suspicion, it is 
true. Yes, I suspected. But I did 
not really think, Tom, that there 
was a question of bombing. It is 
not how we were taught. It is not 

130 



what Slovetski promised, when 
we began.” 

“You mean you didn’t know 
Slovetski was planning violence?” 

She shook her head. “And even 
now, I think, perhaps you heard 
wrong, perhaps there was a mis- 
take.” 

I stood up and leaned over her. 
“Rena, listen to me. There was 
no mistake. They’re working on 
that casing. Tell me what you 
know!” 

She shook her head, weeping 
freely. 

I raged: “This is asinine! What 
can there be that you will not 
tell? The Company supply base 
that Slovetski hopes to raid to 
get a bomb? The officers he plans 
to bribe, to divert some other 
nation’s quota of plutonium?” 

She took a deep breath. “Not 
that, Tom.” 

“Then what? You don’t mean 
to say that he has a complete 
underground separator plant — 
that he is making his own plu- 
tonium!” 

She was silent for a long time, 
looking at me. Then she sighed. 
“I will tell you, Tom. No, he does 
not have a plant. He doesn’t need 
one, you see. He already has a 
bomb.” 

{ STRAIGHTENED. “That’s 
impossible.” * 

She was shaking her head. I 
protested, “But the — the quotas, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Rena. The Company tracks every 
milligram of fissionable material 
from the moment it leaves the 
reactor! The inspections! Expedi- 
ters with Geiger counters cover 
every city in the world!” 

“Not here, Tom. You remem- 
ber that the Sicilians bombed 
Vesuvius? There is a high level 
of radioactivity all up and down 
the mountain. Not enough to be 
dangerous, but enough to mask a 
buried bomb.” She closed her 
eyes. “And — well, you are right, 
Tom. I might as well tell you. In 
that same war, you see, there was 
a bomb that did not explode. You 
recall?” 

“Yes, but — ” 

“But it couldn’t explode, Tom. 
It was a dummy. Slovetski is a 
brilliant man. Before that bomb 
left the ground, he had diverted 
it. What went up was a hollow 
shell. What is left — the heart 
of the bomb — is buried forty 
feet beneath us.” 

I stared at her, the room reel- 
ing. I was clutching at straws. I 
whispered, “But that was only a 
fission bomb, Rena. Slovetski — 
I heard him — he said a Thou- 
sand-kiloton bomb. That means 
hydrogen, don’t you see? Surely 
he hasn’t tucked one of those 
away.” 

Rena’s face was an agony of 
regret. “I do not understand all 
these things, so you must bear 
with me. I know this; there has 



been secret talk about the Milan- 
ese generators, and I know that 
the talk has to do with heavy 
water. And I am not stupid alto- 
gether, I know that from heavy 
water one can get what is used 
in a hydrogen bomb. And there 
is more, of course — lithium, 
perhaps? But he has that. You 
have seen it, I think. It is on a 
pedestal in this building.” 

I sat down hard. It was im- 
possible. But it all fell into place. 
Given the fissionable core of the 
bomb — plus the deuterium, plus 
the lithium-bearing shell — it 
was no great feat to put the parts 
together and make a Hell-bomb. 

The mind rejected it; it was 
too fantastic. It was frightful 
and terrifying, and worst of all 
was that something lurking at the 
threshold of memory, something 
about that bomb on display in 
the museum. 

And, of course, I remembered. 
“Rena!” I said, struggling for 
breath. I nearly could not go on, 
it was too dreadful to say. “Rena! 
Have you ever looked at that 
bomb? Have you read the pla- 
card on it? That bomb is cobalt!” 

XI 

T^ROM the moment I had 
heard those piercing words 
from Slovetski’s mouth, I had 
been obsessed with a vision. A 
Hell-bomb on the Home Office.

America’s eastern seaboard split 
open. New York a hole in the 
ocean, from Kingston to Sandy 
Hook; orange flames spreading 
across Connecticut and the Penn- 
sylvania corner. 

That was gone — and in its 
place was something worse. 

Radiocobalt bombing wouldn’t 
simply kill locally by a gout of 
flaring radiation. It would leave 
the atmosphere filled with col- 
loidal particles of deadly, radio- 
active Cobalt-60. A little of that 
could be used to cure cancers 
and perform miracles. The 
amount released from the sheath- 
ing of cobalt — normal, “safe” 
cobalt — around a fissioning hy- 
drogen bomb could kill a world. 
A single bomb of that kind could 
wipe out all life on Earth, as I 
remembered my schooling. 

I’m no physicist; I didn’t know 
what the quantities involved 
might mean, once the equations 
came off the drafting paper and 
settled like a ravening storm on 
the human race. But I had a 
glimpse of radioactive dust in 
every breeze, in every corner of 
every land. Perhaps a handful of 
persons in Cambodia or Vladi- 
vostok or Melbourne might live 
through it. But there was no ques- 
tion in my mind: If that bomb 
went off, it was the end of our 
civilization. 

I saw it clearly. 

And so, having betrayed the 

132 



Company to Slovetski’s gang, I 
came full circle. 

Even Judas betrayed only 
One. 

Z 1 ETTING away from the Ob- 
servatory was simple enough, 
with Rena shocked and confused 
enough to look the other way. 
Finding a telephone near Mount 
Vesuvius was much harder. 

I was two miles from the 
mountain before I found what I 
was looking for — a Blue Wing 
fully-automatic filling station. 
The electronic scanners clucked 
worriedly, as they searched for 
the car I should have been driv- 
ing, and the policy-punching slot 
glowed red and receptive, wait- 
ing for my order. I ignored them. 

What I wanted was inside the 
little unlocked building — A 
hushaphone-booth with vision at- 
tachment. The important thing 
was to talk direct to Defoe and 
only to Defoe. In the vision 
screen, impedance mismatch 
would make the picture waver if 
there was anyone uninvited list- 
ening in. 

But I left the screen off while 
I put through my call. The office 
servo-operator (it was well after 
business hours) answered bland- 
ly, and I said: “Connect me with 
Defoe, crash priority.” 

It was set to handle priority 
matters on a priority basis; there 
was neither fuss nor argument, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



though a persistent buzzing in 
the innards of the phone showed 
that, even while the robot was 
locating Defoe for me, it was 
double-checking the connection 
to find out why there was no 
vision on the screen. 

It said briskly, “Stand by, sir,” 
and I was connected with Defoe’s 
line — on a remote hookup with 
the hotel where he was staying, 
I guessed. I flicked the screen 
open. 

But it wasn’t Defoe on the 
other end of the line. It was Susan 
Manchester, with that uncharac- 
teristic, oddly efficient look she 
had shown at the vaults. 

She said crisply, and not at all 
surprised: “Tom Wills.” 

“That’s right,” I said, thinking 
quickly. Well, it didn’t much mat- 
ter. I should have realized that 
Defoe’s secretary, howsoever tem- 
porary, would be taking his calls. 
I said rapidly: “Susan, I can’t talk 
to you. It has to be Defoe. Take 
my word for it, it’s important. 
Please put him on.” 

She gave me no more of an 
argument than the robot had. 

In a second, Defoe was on the 
screen, and I put Susan out of 
my mind. She must have said 
something to him, because the 
big, handsome face was unsur- 
prised, though the eyes were con- 
tracted. “Wills!” he snapped. 
“You fool! Where are you?” 

I said, “Mr. Defoe, I have to 



talk to you. It’s a very urgent 
matter.” 

“Come in and do it, Wills! Not 
over the telephone.” 

I shook my head. “No, sir. I 
can’t. It’s too, well, risky.” 

“Risky for you, you mean!” 
The words were icily disgusted. 
“Wills, you have betrayed me. 
No man ever got away with that. 
You’re imposing on me, playing 
on my family loyalty to your 
dead wife, and I want to tell you 
that you won’t get away with it. 
There’s a murder charge against 
you, Wills! Come in and talk to 
me — or else the police will pick 
you up before noon.” 

T SAID with an effort, “I don’t 
mean to impose on any loyalty, 
but, in common decency, you 
ought to hear — ” 

“Decency!” His face was cold. 
“You talk about decency! You 
and that dell’Angela traitor you 
joined. Decency! Wills, you’re 
a disgrace to the memory of a 
decent and honest woman like 
Marianna. I can only say that I 
am glad — glad, do you hear me? 
— that she’s dead and rid of you.” 
I said, “Wait a minute, Defoe! 
Leave Marianna out of this. I 
only — ” 

“Don’t interrupt me! God, to 
think a man I trusted should turn 
out to be Judas himself! You ani- 
mal, the Company has protected 
you from the day you were born,

133 



and you try to destroy it. Why, 
you pitiful idiot, you aren’t fit to 
associate with the dogs in the 
kennel of a decent human being!” 
There was more. Much, much 
more. It was a flow of abuse that 
paralyzed me, less because of 
what he said than because of who 
was saying it. Suave, competent 
Defoe, ranting at me like a 
wounded Gogarty! I couldn’t 
have been more astonished if the 
portrait of Millen Carmody had 
whispered a bawdy joke from the 
frontispiece of the Handbook. 

I stood there, too amazed to 
be furious, listening to the tirade 
from the midget image in the 
viewplate. It must have lasted 
for three or four minutes; then, 
almost in mid-breath, Defoe 
glanced at something outside my 
range of vision, and stopped his 
stream of abuse. I started to cut 
in while I could, but he held up 
one hand quickly. 

He smiled gently. Very calmly, 
as though he had not been damn- 
ing me a moment before, he said: 
“I shall be very interested to hear 
what you have to say.” 

That floored me. It took me a 
second to shake the cobwebs out 
of my brain before I said wasp- 
ishly, “If you hadn’t gone through 
all that jabber, you would have 
heard it long ago.” 

The midget in the scanner 
shrugged urbanely. “True,” he 
conceded. “But then, Thomas, I 
134 



wouldn’t have had you.” 

And he reached forward and 
clicked off the phone. Tricked! 
Tricked and trapped! I cursed 
myself for stupidity. While he 
kept me on the line, the call was 
being traced — there was no 
other explanation. And I had 
fallen for it! 

I slapped the door of the booth 
open and leaped out. 

I got perhaps ten feet from 
the booth. 

Then a rope dropped over my 
shoulders. Its noose yanked tight 
around my arms, and I was being 
dragged up, kicking futilely. I 
caught a glimpse of the broad 
Latin faces gaping at me from 
below, then two men on a rope 
ladder had me. 

I was dragged in through the 
bottom hatch of a big helicopter 
with no markings. The hatch 
closed. Facing me was a lieuten- 
ant of expediters. 

The two men tumbled in after 
me and reeled in the rope ladder, 
as the copter dipped and swerved 
away. I let myself go limp as the 
rope was loosened around me; 
when my hands were free I made 
my bid. 

I leaped for the lieutenant; my 
fist caught him glancingly on the 
throat, sending him reeling and 
choking backward. I grabbed for 
the hard-pellet gun at his hip — 
he was pawing at it — and we 
tumbled across the floor.

It was, for one brief moment, 
a chance. I was no copter pilot, 
but the gun was all the pilot I’d 
need — if only I got it out. 

But the expediters behind me 
were no amateurs. I ducked as 
the knotted end of the rope 
whipped savagely toward me. 
Then one of the other expediters 
was on my back; the gun came 
out, and flew free. And that was 
the end of that. 

I had, I knew, been a fool to 
try it. But I wasn’t sorry. They 
had too much rough-and-tumble 
training for me to handle. But 
that one blow had felt good. 

It didn’t seem as worth while 
a few moments later. I was fast- 
ened to a seat, while the wheez- 
ing lieutenant gave orders in a 
strangled voice. “Not too many 
marks on him,” he was saying. 
“Try it over the kidneys again. .” 
I never even thought of main- 
taining a heroic silence. They 
had had plenty of experience 
with the padded club, too, and I 
started to black out twice before 
finally I went all the way down. 

1 CAME to with a light shining 
in my eyes. 

There was a doctor putting his 
equipment away. “He’ll be all 
right, Mr. Defoe,” he said, and 
snapped his’ bag shut and left the 
circle of light. 

I felt terrible, but my head 
was clearing. 

136 



I managed to focus my eyes. 
Defoe was there, and a couple of 
other men. I recognized Gogarty, 
looking sick and dejected, and 
another face I knew — it was 
out of my Home Office training 
— an officer whose name I didn’t 
recall, wearing the uniform of a 
lieutenant-general of expediters. 
That meant at least an expediter 
corps in Naples! 

I said weakly, “Hi.” 

Defoe stood over me. He 
said, “I’m very glad to see you, 
Thomas. Coffee?” 

He steadied my hands as I 
gulped it. When I had managed 
a few swallows, he took the cup 
away. 

“I did not think you would 
resist arrest, Thomas,” he said in 
a parental tone. 

I said, “Damn it, you didn’t 
have to arrest me! I came down 
here of my own free will!” 

“Down?” His eyebrows rose. 
“Down from where do you mean, 
Thomas?” 

“Down from Mount — ” I hesi- 
tated, then finished. “All right. 
Down from Mount Vesuvius. The 
museum, where I was hiding out 
with the ringleaders of the anti- 
Company movement. Is that what 
you want to know?” 

Defoe crackled: “Manning!” 

The lieutenant-general saluted 
and left the room. Defoe said, 
“That was the first thing I 
wanted, yes. But now I want 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



much more. Please begin talking, 
Thomas. I will listen.” 

I talked. There was nothing to 
stop me. Even with my body a 
mass of aches and pains from the 
tender care of the Company’s ex- 
pediters, I still had to side with 
the Company in this. For the 
Cobalt-bomb ended all loyalties. 

I left nothing important out, 
not even Rena. I admitted that I 
had taken Benedetto from the 
clinic, how we had escaped to 
Rome, how we had fled to Vesu- 
vius . and what I had learned. 
I made it short, skipping a few 
unimportant things like Zorchi. 

And Defoe sat sipping his 
coffee, listening, his warm eyes 
twinkling. 

I stopped. He pursed his lips, 
considering. 

“Silly,” he said at last. 

“Silly? What’s silly!” 

He said, “Thomas, I don’t care 
about your casual affairs. And I 
would have excused your — pre- 
cipitousness — since you have 
brought back certain useful in- 
formation. Quite useful. I don’t 
deny it. But I don’t like being 
lied to, Thomas.” 

“I haven’t lied!” 

He said sharply, “There is no 
way to get fissionable material 
except through the Company!” 
“Oh, hell!” I shook my head. 
“How about a dud bomb, Defoe?” 
For the first time he looked 
puzzled. “Dud bomb?” 



Gogarty looked sick. “There’s 
— there’s a report on your desk, 
Mr. Defoe,” he said worriedly. 
“We — well — figured the half- 
masses just got close enough to 
boil instead of to explode. We — ” 
“I see.” Defoe looked at him 
for a long moment. Then, disre- 
garding Gogarty, he turned back 
to me, shoved the coffee at me. 
“All right, Thomas. They’ve got 
the warhead. Hydrogen? Cobalt? 
What about fuel?” 

I told him what I knew. Go- 
garty, listening, licked his lips. I 
didn’t envy him. I could see the 
worry in him, the fear of Defoe’s 
later wrath. For in Defoe, as in 
Slovetski, there was that deadly 
fire. It blazed only when it was 
allowed to; but what it touched 
withered and died. I had not seen 
Defoe as tightly concentrated, as 
drivingly intent, before. I was 
sorry for Gogarty when at last, 
having drained me dry, Defoe 
left. But I was glad for me. 

H E WAS gone less than an 
hour — just time for me to 
eat a Class-C meal a silent expe- 
diter brought. 

He thrust the door open and 
stared at me with whitely glar- 
ing eyes. “If I thought you were 
lying, Thomas . .” His voice was 
cracking with suppressed emo- 
tion. 

“What happened?” I demand- 
ed. 



PREFERRED RISK 



137 



“Don’t you know?” He stood 
trembling, staring at me. “You 
told the truth — or part of the 
truth. There was a hideout on 
Vesuvius. But an hour ago they 
got away — while you were wast- 
ing time. Was it a stall, Thomas? 
Did you know they would run?” 
I said, “Defoe, don’t you see, 
that’s all to the good? If they had 
to run, they couldn’t possibly 
take the bomb with them. That 
means — ” 

He was shaking head. “Oh, but 
you’re wrong, Thomas. According 
to the director of the albergo 
down the hill, three skyhook heli- 
copters came over — big ones. 
They peeled the roof off, as easy 
as you please, and they lifted the 
bomb out and then flew away.” 

SAID stupidly, “Where?” 

He nodded. There was no emo- 
tion in his voice, only in his eyes. 
He might have been discussing 
the weather. “Where? That is a 
good question. I hope we will 
find it out, Thomas. We’re check- 
ing the radar charts; they can’t 
hide for long. But how did they 
get away at all? Why did you 
give them the time?” 

He left me. Perversely, I was 
almost glad. It was part of the 
price of switching allegiance, I 
was learning, that shreds and tat- 
ters of loyalties cling to you and 
carry over. When I went against 
the Company to rescue Bene- 

138 



detto, I still carried with me my 
Adjusters’ Handbook. And I con- 
fess that I never lost the habit 
of reading a page or two in it, 
even in the Catacombs, when 
things looked bad. And when I 
saw the murderous goal that 
Slovetski’s men were marching 
toward, and I returned to Defoe, 
I still could feel glad that Bene- 
detto, at least, had got away. 

But not far. 

It was only a few hours, but 
already broad daylight when 
Gogarty, looking shaken, came 
into the room. He said testily, 
“Damn it, Wills, I wish I’d never 
seen you! Come on! Defoe wants 
you with us.” 

“Come on where?” I got up as 
he gestured furiously for haste. 

“Where do you think? Did you 
think your pals would be able to 
stay out of sight forever? We’ve 
got them pinpointed, bomb and 
all.” 

He was almost dragging me 
down the corridor, toward a 
courtyard. I limped out into the 
bright morning and blinked. The 
court was swarming with armed 
expediters, clambering into per- 
sonnel-carrying copters marked 
with the vivid truce-team insignia 
of the Company. Gogarty hustled 
me into the nearest and the jets 
sizzled and we leaped into the air. 

I shouted, over the screaming 
of the jets, “Where are we going?” 

Gogarty spat and pointed down 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the long purple coastline. “To 
their hideout — Pompeii!” 

XII 

TV" O ONE discussed tactics with 
' me, but it was clear that this 
operation was carefully planned. 
Our copter was second in a long 
string of at least a dozen that 
whirled down the coastline, past 
the foothills of Vesuvius, over 
the clusters of fishing villages 
and vineyards. 

I had never seen Pompeii, but 
I caught a glimpse of something 
glittering and needle-nosed, up- 
thrust in the middle of a cluster 
of stone buildings that might 
have been the ruins. 

Then the first ten of the cop- 
ters spun down to a landing, 
while two or three more flew a 
covering mission overhead. 

The expediters, hard-pellet 

guns at the ready, leaped out and 
formed in a skirmish line. Go- 
garty and a pair of expediters 
stayed close by me, behind the 
line of attack; we followed the 
troops as they dog-trotted 

through a field of some sort of 
grain, around fresh excavations, 
down a defile into the shallow 
pit that held the ruins of first- 
century Pompeii. 

I had no time for archeology, 
but I remember tripping over 
wide, shallow gutters in the stone- 
paved streets, and cutting through 



a tiny villa of some sort whose 
plaster walls still were decorated 
with faded frescoes. 

Then we heard the spatter of 
gunfire and Gogarty, clutching at 
me, skidded to a halt. “This is 
specialist work,” he panted. “Best 
thing we can do is stay out of it.” 

I peered around a column and 
saw a wide open stretch. Beyond 
it was a Roman arch and the 
ruined marble front of what once 
had been a temple of some sort; 
in the open ground lay the three 
gigantic copters Defoe had men- 
tioned. 

The vanes of one of them were 
spinning slowly, and it lurched 
and quivered as someone tried to 
get it off the ground under fire. 
But the big thing was in the 
middle of the area: The bomb, 
enormous and terrifying as its 
venomous nose thrust up into the 
sky. By its side was a tank truck, 
the side of it painted with the 
undoubtedly untrue legend that 
it contained crude olive oil. 
Hydrazine, more likely! 

Hoses connected it with the 
base of the guided-missile bomb; 
and a knot of men were feverish- 
ly in action around it, some claw- 
ing desperately at the fittings of 
the bomb, some returning the 
skirmish fire of the expediters. 

We had the advantage of sur- 
prise, but not very much of that. 
From the top of the ancient tem- 
ple a rapid-fire pellet gun sprayed 



PREFERRED RISK 



139 



into the flank of the skirmish line, 
which immediately broke up as 
the expediters leaped for cover. 

One man fell screaming out of 
the big skyhook copter, but some- 
one remained inside, for it 
lurched and dipped and roared 
crazily across the field in as 
ragged a takeoff as I ever saw, 
until its pilot got it under control. 
It bobbed over the skirmish line 
under fire, but returning the fire 
as whatever few persons were 
inside it leaned out and strafed 
the expediters. Then the skyhook 
itself came under attack as the 
patrol copters swooped in. 

The big ship staggered toward 
the nearest of them. It must have 
been intentional: We could see 
the faint flare of muzzle-blast as 
the two copters fired on each 
other; they closed, and there was 
a brutal rending noise as they 
collided. They were barely a hun- 
dred feet in the air; they crashed 
in a breath, and flames spread 
out from the wreckage. 

A ND Slovetski’s resources still 
had not run out. There was 
a roar and a screech of metal, 
and a one-man cobra tank slith- 
ered out of one of the buildings 
and came rapidly across the field 
toward the expediters. 

Gogarty, beside me, was sob- 
bing with fear; that little tank 
carried self-loading rockets. It 
blasted a tiny shrine into rubble, 

140 



spun and came directly toward 
us. 

We ran. I didn’t even see the 
second expediter aircraft come 
whirling in and put the cobra 
tank out of action with its heavy 
weapons. I heard the firing, but 
it was swallowed up in a louder 
screaming roar. 

Gogarty stared at me from the 
drainage trench we had flung our- 
selves into. We both leaped up 
and ran back toward the open 
field. 

There was an explosion as we 
got there — the fake “olive-oil” 
truck, now twenty yards from the 
bomb, had gone up in a violent 
blast. But we hardly noticed. For 
at the base of the bomb itself 
red-purple fire was billowing out. 
It screamed and howled and 
changed color to a blinding blue 
as the ugly squat shape danced 
and jiggled. The roar screamed 
up from a bull-bass to a shriek- 
ing coloratura and beyond as the 
bomb lifted and gained speed 
and, in the blink of an eye, was 
gone. 

I hardly noticed that the sound 
of gunfire died raggedly away. 
We were not the only ones star- 
ing unbelievingly at the sky 
where that deadly shape had dis- 
appeared. Of the scores of men 
on both sides in that area, not a 
single eye was anywhere else. 

The bomb had been fueled; we 
were too late. Its servitors, per- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



haps at the cost of their own 
lives, had torched it off. It was 
on its way. 

The cobalt bomb — the single 
weapon that could poison the 
world and wipe out the human 
race — was on its way.

W HAT can you do after the 
end? What becomes of any 
plot or plan, when an indigo- 
gleaming missile sprays murder 
into the sky and puts a period to 
planning? 

I do not think there ever was 
a battlefield as abruptly quiet as 
that square in old Pompeii. Once 
the bomb had gone, there was 
not a sound. The men who had 
been firing on each other were 
standing still, jaws hanging, eyes 
on the sky. 

But it couldn’t last. For one 
man was not surprised; one man 
knew what was happening and 
was ready for it. 

A crouching figure at the top 
of the ruined temple gesticulated 
and shouted through a power- 
megaphone: “Give it up, Defoe! 
You’ve lost, you’ve lost!” It was 
Slovetski, and beside him a ma- 
chine-gun crew sighted in on the 
> nearest knot of expediters. 

Pause, while the Universe 
waited. And then his answer 
came; it was a shot that screamed 
off a cracked capital, missing him 



by millimeters. He dropped from 
sight, and the battle was raging. 

Human beings are odd. Now 
that the cause of the fight was 
meaningless, it doubled in vio- 
lence. There were fewer than a 
hundred of Slovetski’? men in- 
volved, and not much more than 
that many expediters. But for 
concentrated violence I think 
they must have overmatched 
anything in the Short War’s end- 
ing. 

I was a non-combatant; but 
the zinging of the hard-pellet fire 
swarmed all around me. Gogarty, 
in his storm sewer, was safe 
enough, but I was more exposed. 
While the rapid-fire weapons pat- 
tered all around me, I jumped 
up and zigzagged for the shelter 
of a low-roofed building. 

The walls were little enough 
protection, but at least I had the 
illusion of safety. Most of all, I 
was out of sight. 

I wormed my way through a 
gap in the wall to an inner cham- 
ber. It was as tiny a room as ever 
I have been in; less than six feet 
in its greatest dimension — 
length — and with most of its 
floor area taken up by what 
seemed to be a rude built-in bed. 
Claustrophobia hit me there; the 
wall on the other side was broken 
too, and I wriggled through. 

The next room was larger; and 
it was -occupied. 

A man lay, panting heavily, in

a corner. He pushed himself up 
on an elbow to look at me. In a 
ragged voice he said: “Thomas!” 
And he slumped back, exhausted 
by the effort, blood dripping 
from his shirt. 

I leaped over to the side of 
Benedetto dell’Angela. The noise 
of the battle outside rose to a 
high pitch and dwindled raggedly 
away. 

T SUPPOSE it was inertia that 
-l kept me going — certainly I 
could see with my mind’s vision 
no reason to keep struggling. The 
world was at an end. There was 
no reason to try again to escape 
from the rubber hoses of the 
expediters — and, after I had 
seen the resistance end, and an 
expediter-officer appeared atop 
the temple where Slovetski had 
shouted his defiance, no possi- 
bility of rejoining the rebels. 

Without Slovetski, they were 
lost. 

But I kept on. 

Benedetto helped. He knew 
every snake-hole entrance and 



exit of all the hideouts of Slovet- 
ski’s group. They had not sur- 
vived against the strength of the 
Company without acquiring skill 
in escape routes; and here, too, 
they had a way out. It required* 
a risky dash across open ground 
but, even with Benedetto on my 
back, I made it. 

And then we were in old Pom- 
peii’s drainage sewer, the arched 
stone tunnel that once had car- 
ried sewage from the Roman 
town to the sea. It was a hiding 
place, and then a tunnel to free- 
dom, for the two of us. 

We waited there all of that 
day, Benedetto mumbling almost 
inaudibly beside me. In lucid mo- 
ments, he told me the name of 
the hotel where Rena had gone 
when the Observatory was aban- 
doned, but there seemed few 
lucid moments. Toward evening, 
he began to recover. 

We found our way to the sea- 
shore just as darkness fell. There 
was a lateen-rigged fishing vessel 
of some sort left untended. I do 
not suppose the owner was far

away, but he did not return in 
time to stop us. 

Benedetto was very weak. He 
was muttering to himself, words 
that I could hardly understand. 
“Wasted, wasted, wasted,” was 
the burden of his complaint. I 
did not know what he thought 
was wasted — except, perhaps, 
the world. 

We slipped in to one of the 
deserted wharves under cover of 
darkness, and I left Benedetto to 
find a phone. It was risky, but 
what risk mattered when the 
world was at an end? 

Rena was waiting at the hotel. 
She answered at once. I did not 
think the call had been inter- 
cepted — or that it would mean 
anything to anyone if it had. I 
went back to the boat to wait 
with Benedetto for Rena to 
arrive, in a rented car. We didn’t 
dare chance a cab. 

Benedetto was sitting up, 
propped rigidly against the mast, 



staring off across the water. Per- 
haps I startled him as I came to 
the boat; he turned awkwardly 
and cried out weakly. 

Then he saw that it was I. He 
said something I could not under- 
stand and pointed out toward 
the west, where the Sun had gone 
down long before. 

But there was still light there 
— though certainly not sunset. 

Far off over the horizon was a 
faint glow! I couldn’t understand 
at first, since I was sure the bomb 
had been zeroed-in on the Home 
Offices in New York; but some- 
thing must have happened. From 
that glow, still showing in the 
darkness so many hours after the 
explosion as the dust particles 
gleamed bluely, it must have 
gone off over the Atlantic. 

There was no doubt in my 
mind any longer. The most dead- 
ly weapon the world had ever 
known had gone off!
