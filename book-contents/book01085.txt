THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some— but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hick- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

N INE A. M. The mail. Let- 
ter from a fellow stationed 
at Eglin Air Force Base, 
Florida. Unfortunately he doesn’t 
sign his name, but he encloses an 
advertising throwaway from the 
field, which lists under Lost and 
Found: 

FOUND. Hutch brand, 6 finger 
baseball glove. 

Says this is another clear proof 
that There Are Aliens Among us. 
Submitted same to our board of 
experts; they decide that the evi- 
dence is ambiguous. It doesn’t 
prove aliens are here. It only 
proves that aliens were here; may 
have departed, leaving their six- 
fingered baseball gloves behind. 

Ten A. M. Two letters from 
the sponsors of s-f conclaves. One, 
the Midwescon, to be held June 
23rd, 24th and 25th, at the North 
Plaza Motel, 7911 Reading Road, 
Cincinnati, Ohio; will we let our 
readers know about it? 

The other from the SeaCon 
Committee — that is, the Nine- 
teenth World Science-Fiction 
Convention, to be held in Seattle, 
Washington, over Labor Day 
weekend. Their plans are proceed- 
ing rapidly. The place will be the 
Ryatt House (they claim it’s 
America’s first air-age hotel, with 
direct fly-in accommodations); 


the Guest of Honor will be Robert 
A. Heinlein; the place to write for 
information is Seattle Science- 
Fiction Club, P. O. Box 1365, 
Broadway Branch, Seattle 2, 
Washington. And they too would 
like us to tell our readers. 

Eleven-thirty, and the tele- 
phone: 

“Sir, I’m Dr. , and I 

have here a patient under light 
hypnosis who — ” 

“A what?’’ 

“A patient. I have him under 
light hypnosis. He is recalling 
from memory a poem which ap- 
peared in the October, 1957, issue 
of Galaxy, page 56. Will you 
check it, please? I would like to 
know if he has it right.” 

“Um . Well . Just a 
minute.” 

(Search through files.) 

“Hello? There’s no poem on 
that page. It’s part of a story by 
Daniel F. Galouye. Come to think 
of it. Galaxy never ran a poem 
on any page of any issue.” 

“Thank you.” 

(End of telephone call.) 

Two o’clock. The afternoon 
package mail arrives. 

Big square package; open it up, 
and it’s a two-volume book by 
Isaac Asimov. The Intelligent 


A LIFE IN THE DAY OF AN EDITOR 


5 


Man’s Guide to Science. Looks 
pretty exciting. 

Read a couple of sentences 
here and there. On the future 
development of computers: 

We represent, for the first time 
in the history of life on the Earth, 
a species capable of bringing about 
its own possible replacement. Of 
course, we have it in our power to 
prevent such a regrettable denoue- 
ment by refusing to build machines 
that are too intelligent. But it is 
tempting to build them nevertheless. 
What achievement could be grander 
than the creation of an object that 
surpasses the creator? 

On our neighbor worlds in 
space: 

There may be as many as five 
billion life-bearing planets in our 
Galaxy and 50 billion billion in the 
known Universe ... On at least 
some of those planets life may very 
well have evolved to what we would 
call “intelligent” forms. Even if this 
has happened in only one inhabited 
planet out of a million, there would 
still be 5,000 planets in our Galaxy 
bearing intelligent life and 50 million 
billion in the Universe. 

Fascinating stuff! Would be 
good to sit down and start read- 
ing the whole thing right now 
. but there’s a mass of proof- 
reading to get through ... a maga- 
zine to edit . and what’s this 
other package, anyway? 

Turns out to be nothing more 
nor less than a Galaxy for Galaxy. 


No fooling. It’s called the “Seelo 
Galaxy Globe” — transparent 
vinyl plastic, the size of a beach 
ball; blow it up (with a bicycle 
pump; this is no ordinary beach 
ball; the moisture in the breath 
harms it) and you have in three 
dimensions the entire sky as seen 
from Earth — a desk-sized plane- 
tarium for Everyman! 

The accompanying literature 
tells us something about the man 
who made it. He is also a college 
teacher — mathematics, this time. 
A Californian; his name is Theo- 
dore Vincent. He spent six months 
preparing his master stencils, and 
now can convert two sheets of 
vinyl plastic into a Galaxy Globe 
by running them through a silk 
screen six times — to show the 
star names, the constellations, the 
latitude and longitude and various 
other data in five colors; and to 
show the stars themselves and the 
Milky Way in fluorescent white. 

Fluorescent? Let’s try. We 
hold the inflated globe up to a 
ceiling light, locate a dark room 

— and there it is. The night 
sky. Big Dipper, Gemini, Orion 

— Southern Cross, Magellanic 
Clouds — everything. 

A beautiful job! 

Five o’clock. Telephone again, 
from the Production Department: 

“Where the devil are those 
proofs?” 

But tomorrow will be another 
day . —THE EDITOR

swooped in and landed. 
Johnny McCord emptied 
his pipe into the wastebasket, 
came to his feet and strolled 
toward the open door. He auto- 
matically took up a sun helmet 


before emerging into the Saharan 
sun. 

He was dressed in khaki shorts 
and short-sleeved shirt, wool 
socks and yellow Moroccan ba- 
bouche slippers. 

The slippers were strictly out 
of uniform and would have been

mediate superiors. However, the in the swank air-conditioned 
Arabs had been making footwear buildings of Colomb-Bechar, Ta- 
suitable for sandy terrain for cen- manrasset and Timbuktu, from 
turies before there had ever been whence they issued lengthy bul- 
a Sahara Reforestation Commis- letins on the necessity of never 
sion. Johnny was in favor of allowing a Malian to see a Corn- 
taking advantage of their know- mission employee in less than the 
how. Especially since the top correct dress and in less than 
brass made a point of staying commanding dignity. While they

were busily at work composing 
such directives, field men such as 
Johnny McCord went about the 
Commission’s real tasks. 

It was auto-copter 4, which 
Johnny hadn’t expected for an- 
other half hour. He extracted the 
reports and then peered into the 
cockpit to check. There were two 
red lights flickering on the panel. 
Work for Reuben. This damned 
sand was a perpetual hazard to 
equipment. Number 4 had just 
had an overhaul a few weeks be- 
fore and here it was throwing red 
lights already. 

He took the reports back into 
the office and dumped them into 
the card-punch. While they were 
being set up, Johnny went over 
to the office refrigerator and got 
out a can of Tuborg beer. Theo- 
retically, it was as taboo to drink 
iced beer in this climate, and 
particularly at this time of day, 
as it was to go out into the sun 
without a hat. But this was one 
place where the Commission’s 
medics could go blow. 

By the time he’d finished the 
Danish brew, the card-punch had 
stopped clattering so he took the 
cards from the hopper and 
crossed to the sorter. He gave 
them a quick joggling — cards 
held up well in this dry climate, 
though they were a terror fur- 
ther south — and sorted them 
through four code numbers, 
enough for this small an amount. 


He carried them over to the 
collator and merged them into 
the proper file. 

He was still running off a re- 
port on the Alphabetyper when 
Derek Mason came in. 

Johnny drawled in a horrible 
caricature of a New England 
accent, “I say, Si, did the cyclone 
hurt your barn any?” 

Derek’s voice took on the 
same twang. “Don’t know, Hiram, 
we ain’t found it yet.” 

Johnny said, “You get all your 
chores done, Si?” 

Derek dropped the pseudo- 
twang and his voice expressed 
disgust. “I got a chore for you. 
Johnny, that you’re going to love. 
Rounding up some livestock.” 
Johnny looked up from the 
report he was running off and 
shot an impatient glance at him. 
“Livestock? What the hell are 
you talking about?” 

“Goats.” 

Johnny McCord flicked the 
stop button on the Alphabetyper. 
“Where’ve you been? There isn’t 
a goat within five hundred miles 
of here.” 

Derek went over to the refrig- 
erator for beer. He said over his 
shoulder, “I was just making a 
routine patrol over toward Ame- 
rene El Kasbach. I’d estimate 
there were a hundred Tuareg in 
camp there. Camels, a few sheep, 
a few horses and donkeys. Mostly 
goats. Thousands of them. By the 


10 


GALAXY 


looks of the transplants, they’ve 
been there possibly a week or so.” 

J OHNNY said in agony, “Oh, 
Lord. What clan were they?” 
Derek punched a hole in his 
beer can with the opener that 
hung from the refrigerator by a 
string. “I didn’t go low enough to 
check. You can never tell with a 
Tuareg. They can’t resist as 
beautiful a target as a helicopter, 
and one of these days one of 
them is going to make a hole in 
me, instead of in the fuselage 
or rotors.” 

Johnny McCord, furious, 
plunked himself down before the 
telephone and dialed Tessalit, 
275 kilometers to the south. The 
girl on the desk there grinned 
at him and said, “Hello, Johnny.” 
Johnny McCord was in no mood 
for pleasantries. He snapped, 
“Who’s supposed to be on Bed- 
ouin patrol down there?” 

She blinked at him. “Why, 
Mohammed is in command of 
patroling this area, Mr. McCord.” 
“Mohammed? Mohammed 
who? Eighty percent of these 
Malians are named Mohammed.” 
“Captain Mohammed Moh- 
moud ould Cheikh.” She added, 
unnecessarily, “The Cadi’s son.” 
Johnny grunted. He’d always 
suspected that the captain, had 
got his ideas of what a cadi’s son 
should be like from seeing Holly- 
wood movies. “Look, Kate,” he 


said. “Let me talk to Mellor, will 
you?” 

Her face faded to be replaced 
by that of a highly tanned, 
middle-aged executive type. He 
scowled at Johnny McCord with 
a this-better-be-important expres- 
sion, not helping, Johnny’s dis- 
position. 

He snapped, “Somebody’s let 
several thousand goats into my 
eucalyptus transplants in my 
western four hundred.” 

Mellor was taken aback. 

Johnny said. “I can have Derek 
back-trail them, if you want to 
be sure, but it’s almost positive 
they came from the south, this 
time of year.” 

Mellor sputtered, “They might 
have come from the direction of 
Timmissao. Who are they, any- 
way?” 

“I don’t know. Tuareg. I 
thought we’d supposedly settled 
with all the Tuareg. Good Lord, 
man, do you know how many 
transplants a thousand goats can 
go through in a week’s time?” 

“A week’s time!” Mellor rasped. 
“You mean you’ve taken a whole 
week to detect them?” 

Johnny McCord glared at him. 
“A whole week! We’re lucky they 
didn’t spend the whole season be- 
fore we found them. How big a 
staff do you think we have here, 
Mellor? There’s just three of us. 
Only one can be spared for 
patrol.”

“You have natives,” the older 
man growled. 

“They can’t fly helicopters. 
Most of them can’t even drive a 
Land Rover or a jeep. Besides 
that, they’re scared to death of 
Tuaregs. They wouldn’t dare re- 
port them. What I want to know 
is, why didn’t you stop them com- 
ing through?” 

Mellor was on the defensive. 
He ranked Johnny McCord, but 
that was beside the point right 
now. He said finally, “I’ll check 
this all the way through, McCord. 
Meanwhile, I’ll send young 
Mohammed Mohmoud up with a 
group of his men.” 

“To do what?” Johnny de- 
manded. 

“To shoot the goats, what 
else?” 

J OHNNY growled, “One of 
these days a bunch of these 
Tuareg are going to decide that 
a lynching bee is in order, and 
that’s going to be the end of this 
little base at Bidon Cinq.” 

Mellor said, “If they’re Tuareg 
nomads then they have no legal 
right to be within several hun- 
dred miles of Bidon Cinq. And if 
they’ve got goats, they shouldn’t 
have. The Commission has 
bought up every goat in this part 
of the world.” 

Johnny growled, “Sure, bought 
them up and then left it to the 
honor of the Tuareg to destroy 


them. The honor of the Tuareg! 
Ha!” 

The other said pompously, 
“Are you criticizing the upper 
echelons, McCord?” 

Johnny McCord snapped, 
“You’re damned right I am.” He 
slammed off the telephone and 
turned on Derek Mason. “What 
are you grinning about?” 

Derek drawled, “I say, Hiram, 
I got a sneaky suspicion you ain’t 
never gonna graduate off’n this 
here farm if you don’t learn how 
to cotton up to the city slickers 
better.” 

“Oh, shut up,” Johnny growled. 
“Let’s have another beer.” 

Before Derek could bring it to 
him, the telephone screen lit up 
again and Paul Peterson, of the 
Poste Weygand base, was there. 
He said, “Hi. You guys look like 
you’re having a crisis.” 

“Hello, Paul,” Johnny McCord 
said. “Crisis is right. Those jerks 
down south let a clan of Tuareg, 
complete with a few thousand 
goats, camels and sheep through. 
They’ve been grazing a week or 
more in my west four hundred.” 
“Good grief.” Paul grimaced. 
“At least that’s one thing we don’t 
have to worry about. They never 
get this far up. HowM it hap- 
pen?” 

“I don’t know, but I’m going 
to find out. I haven’t seen the 
mess yet, but it’s certain to wreck 
that whole four hundred. Have 


12 


GALAXY 


you ever seen just one goat at 
work on the bark of three-year 
transplants?” 

Paul shuddered sympathetic- 
ally. “Look, Johnny,” he said. 
“The reason I called you. There’s 
an air-cushion Land Rover com- 
ing through. She just left.” 

Derek Mason looked over 
Johnny’s shoulder into the screen. 
“What d’ya mean, she?” 

Paul grinned. “Just that, and, 
Buster, she’s stacked. A Made- 
moiselle Helene Desage of Paris 
Match.” 

Johnny said, “The French 
magazine? What’s she doing in a 
road car? Why doesn’t she have 
an aircraft? There hasn’t been a 
road car through here this whole 
year.” 

Paul shrugged. “She claims 
she’s getting it from the view- 
point of how things must’ve been 
twenty years ago. So, anyway, 
we’ve notified you. If she doesn’t 
turn up in eight or ten hours, you 
better send somebody to look for 
her.” 

“Yeah,” Johnny McCord said. 
“Well, so long, Paul.” 

The other’s face faded from 
the screen and Johnny McCord 
turned to his colleague. “One more 
extraneous something to foul up 
our schedule.” 

Derek said mildly, “I say, 
Hiram, what’re you complaining 
about? Didn’t you hear tell what 
Paul jest said? She’s stacked. Be 


just like a traveling saleswoman 
visitin’ the farm.” 

“Yeah,” Johnny growled. “And 
I can see just how much work 
I’ll be getting out of you as long 
as she’s here.” 

II 

TJOSTE Maurice Cortier, better 
known in the Sahara as Bidon 
Cinq, is as remote a spot on earth 
in which man has ever lived. 
Some 750 kilometers to the south 
is Bourem on the Niger river. If 
you go west of Bourem another 
363 kilometers, you reach Tim- 
buktu, the nearest thing to a city 
in that part of the Sudan. If you 
travel north from Bidon Cinq 
1,229 kilometers you reach Co- 
lomb-Bechar, the nearest thing to 
a city in southern Algeria. There 
are no railroads, no highways. 
The track through the desert is 
marked by oil drums filled with 
gravel so the wind won’t blow 
them away. There is an oil drum 
every quarter of a mile or so. 
You go from one to the next, 
carrying your own fuel and 
water. If you get lost, the author- 
ities come looking for you in air- 
craft. Sometimes they find you. 

In the latter decades of the 
Twentieth Century, Bidon Cinq 
became an outpost of the Sahara 
Reforestation Commission which 
was working north from the 
Niger, and south from Algeria as 


FARMER

well as east from the Atlantic. 
The water table in the vicinity of 
Bidon Cinq was considerably 
higher than had once been 
thought. Even artesian wells were 
possible in some localities. More 
practical still were springs and 
wells exploited by the new solar- 
powered pumps that in their tens 
of thousands were driving back 
the sands of the world’s largest 
desert. 

Johnny McCord and Derek 
Mason ate in the officer’s mess, 
divorced from the forty or fifty 
Arabs and Songhai who com- 
posed their work force. It wasn’t 
snobbery, simply a matter of 
being able to eat in leisure and 
discuss the day’s activities free 
of the chatter of the larger mess 
hall. 

Derek looked down into his 
plate. “Hiram,” he drawled, “who 
ever invented this here now cous 
cous?” 

Johnny looked over at the tall, 
easy-going Canadian who was his 
second in command and scowled 
dourly. He was in no humor for 
their usual banter. “What’s the 
matter with cous cous?” Johnny 
growled. 

“I don’t know,” Derek said. 
“I’m a meat and potatoes man at 
heart.” 

Johnny shrugged. “ Cous cous 
serves the same purpose as pota- 
toes do. Or rice, or spaghetti, or 
bread, or any of the other bland 


basic foods. It’s what you put on 
it that counts.” 

Derek stared gloomily into his 
dish. “Well, I wish they’d get 
something more interesting than 
ten-year-old mutton to put on 
this.” 

Johnny said, “Where in the 
devil is Pierre? It’s nearly dark.” 
“Reuben?” Derek drawled. 
“Why Reuben went out to check 
the crops up in the northeast 
forty. Took the horse and buggy.” 
That didn’t help Johnny’s irri- 
tation. “He took an air-cushion 
jeep, instead of a copter? Why, 
for heaven’s sake?” 

“He wanted to check quite a 
few of the pumps. Said landing 
and taking off was more trouble 
than the extra speed helped. He’ll 
be back shortly.” 

“He’s back now,” a voice from 
the door said. 

Pierre Marimbert, brushing 
sand from his clothes, pushed into 
the room and made his way to 
the mess-hall refrigerator. He 
said nothing further until he had 
a can of beer open. 

Johnny said, “Damn it, Pierre, 
you shouldn’t stay out this late 
in a jeep. If you got stuck out 
there, we’d have one hell of a 
time finding you. In a copter 
you’ve at least got the radio.” 
Pierre had washed the dust 
from his throat. Now he said 
quietly, “I wanted to check on as 
many pumps as I could.” 


14 


GALAXY 


“You could have gone back to- 
morrow. The things are supposed 
to be self-sufficient, no checking 
necessary more than once every 
three months. There’s practically 
nothing that can go wrong with 
them.” 

Pierre finished off the can of 
beer, reached into the refrigerator 
for another* “Dynamite can go 
wrong with them,” he said. 

T HE other two looked at him, 
shocked silent. 

Pierre said, “I don’t know how 
many altogether. I found twenty- 
two of the pumps in the vicinity 
of In Ziza had been blown to 
smithereens — out of forty I 
checked.” 

Johnny rapped, “How long 
ago? How many trees . ?” 

Pierre laughed sourly. “I don’t 
know how long ago. The trans- 
plants, especially the slash pine, 
are going to be just so much 
kindling before I get new pumps 
in.” 

Derek said, shocked, “That’s 
our oldest stand.” 

Pierre Marimbert, a forty-year- 
old, sun-beaten Algerian colon, 
eldest man on the team, sank into 
his place at the table. He poured 
the balance of his can of beer 
into a glass. 

Johnny said, “What . what 
can we do? How many spare 
pumps can you get into there, 
and how soon?” 


Pierre looked up at him 
wearily. “You didn’t quite hear 
what I said, Johnny. I only 
checked forty. Forty out of 
nearly a thousand in that vicinity. 
Twenty-two of them were de- 
stroyed, better than fifty percent. 
For all I know, that percentage 
applies throughout the whole In 
Ziza area. If so, there’s damn few 
of your trees going to be left 
alive. We have a few spare pumps 
on hand here, but we’d have to 
get a really large number all the 
way from Dakar.” 

Derek said softly, “That took a 
lot of men and a lot of dynamite. 
Which means a lot of transport 
— and a lot of money. We’ve had 
trouble before, but usually it was 
disgruntled nomads, getting re- 
venge for losing their grazing 
land.” 

Johnny snorted, “Damn little 
grazing this far north.” 

Derek nodded. “I’m simply 
saying that even if we could 
blame our minor sabotage on the 
Tuareg in the past, we can’t do 
it this time. There’s money be- 
hind anything this big.” 

Johnny McCord said wearily, 
“Let’s eat. In the morning we’ll 
go out and take a look. I’d better 
call Timbuktu on this. If nothing 
else, the Mali Federation can 
send troops out to protect us.” 
Derek grunted. “With a stand- 
ing army of about 25,000 men, 
they’re going to patrol a million 


FARMER 


15 


and a half square miles of 
desert?” 

“Can you think of anything 
else to do?” 

“No.” 

OIERRE Marimbert began dish- 
ing cous cous into a soup 
plate, then poured himself a glass 
of vin ordinaire. He said, “I can’t 
think of a better place for sabo- 
teurs. Twenty men could do mil- 
lions of dollars of destruction and 
never be found.” 

Johnny growled, “It’s not as 
bad as all that. They’ve got to 
eat and drink, and so do their 
animals. There are damned few 
places where they can.” 

From the door a voice said, 
“I am intruding?” 

They hadn’t heard her car come 
up. The three men scrambled to 
their feet. 

“Good evening,” Johnny Mc- 
Cord blurted. 

“Hell . o!” Derek breathed. 

Pierre Marimbert was across 
the room, taking her in hand. 
“Bonjour, Mademoiselle. Que 
puis-je faire pour vous? Voulez- 
vous une biere bien fraiche ou 
un aperitif? 11 fait tres chaud dans 
le desert.” He led her toward the 
table. 

“Easy, easy there, Reuben,” 
Derek grumbled. “The young lady 
speaks English. Give a man a 
chance.” 

Johnny was placing a chair for 


her. “Paul Peterson, from Poste 
Weygand, radioed that you were 
coming. You’re a little late, Made- 
moiselle Desage.” 

She was perhaps thirty, slim, 
long-legged, Parisian style. Even 
at Bidon Cinq, half a world away 
from the Champs Elysees, she 
maintained her chic. 

She made a moue at Johnny, 
while taking the chair he held. 
“I had hoped to surprise you, 
catch you off guard.” She took in 
the sun-dried, dour-faced Ameri- 
can wood technologist apprais- 
ingly, then turned her eyes in 
turn to Derek and Pierre. 

“You three are out here all 
alone?” she said demurely. 

“Desperately,” Derek said. 

Johnny McCord said, “Made- 
moiselle Helene Desage, I am 
John McCord, and these are my 
associates, Monsieur Pierre Mar- 
imbert and Mr. Derek Mason. 
Gentlemen, Mademoiselle Desage 
is with Paris Match, the French 
equivalent of Life, so I under- 
stand. In short, she is undoubtedly 
here for a story. So ixnay on the 
ump-pays.” 

“I would love cold beer,” 
Helene Desage said to Pierre, and 
to Johnny McCord, “These days 
a traveling reporter for Paris 
Match must be quite a linguist. 
My English, Spanish and Italian 
are excellent. My German pas- 
sable. And while I am not fluent 
in Pig-Latin, I can follow it. What 


16 


GALAXY 


is this you are saying about the 
pumps?” 

“Oh, Lord,” Johnny said. “Per- 
haps I’ll tell you in the morning. 
But for now, would you like to 
clean up before supper? You 
must be exhausted after that 260 
kilometers from Poste Weygand.” 

Pierre said hurriedly, “I’ll take 
Mademoiselle Desage over to one 
of the guest bungalows.” 

“Zut!” she said. “The sand! It is 
even worse than between Reggan 
and Poste Weygand. Do you 
realize that until I began coming 
across your new forests I saw no 
life at all between these two 
posts?” 

The three forestry experts 
bowed in unison, as though re- 
hearsed. “Mademoiselle,” Derek, 
from the heart, “calling our trans- 
plant forests is the kindest thing 
you could have said in these 
parts.” 

They all laughed and Pierre 
led her from the room. 

Derek looked at Johnny Mc- 
Cord. “Wow, that was a slip 
mentioning the pumps.” 

Johnny was looking through 
the door after her. “I suppose 
so,” he said sourly. “I’ll have to 
radio the brass and find out the 
line we’re supposed to take with 
her. That’s the biggest magazine 
in the French-speaking world and 
you don’t get a job on it with- 
out knowing the journalistic 
ropes. That girl can probably 


smell a story as far as a Tuareg 
can smell water.” 

“Well, then undoubtedly she’s 
already sniffing. Because, between 
that clan of Tuareg with its flocks 
and the pump saboteurs, we’ve 
got more stories around here than 
I ever expected!” 

Ill 

TN the morning Helene Desage 
managed to look the last word 
in what desert fashion should be, 
when she strolled into Johnny 
McCord’s office. Although she 
came complete with a sun hel- 
met that must have been the 
product of a top Parisian shop, 
she would have been more at 
place on the beaches at Miami, 
Honolulu or Cannes. Her shorts 
were short and fitting, her blouse 
silken, her walking shoes dainty. 

He considered for a moment 
and then decided against inform- 
ing her that Moslems, particularly 
in this part of the world, were 
little used to seeing semi-nude 
women strolling about. He’d 
leave the job of explanation to 
Pierre, as a fellow Frenchman and 
the oldest man present to boot. 

“Bonjour she said. “What a 
lovely day. I have been strolling 
about your little oasis. But you 
have made it a garden!” 

“Thanks,” Johnny said. “We’ve 
got to have something to do after 
working hours. Entertainment is 


FARMER 


17 


on the scarce side. But it’s more 
than a garden. We’ve been ex- 
perimenting to see just what 
trees will take to this country — 
given water and care through the 
early years. Besides, we use it as 
a showplace.” 

“Showplace?” 

“For skeptical politicians who 
come through,” Johnny said, seat- 
ing her in a chair near his desk. 
“We give them the idea that the 
whole Sahara could eventually 
be like this square mile or so at 
Bidon Cinq. Palm trees, fruit 
trees, pines, shade trees. The 
works.” 

“And could it?” 

Johnny grinned sourly. “Well, 
not exactly. Not all in one spot, at 
least. You’ve got to remember, 
the Sahara covers an area of 
some three and a half million 
square miles. In that area you 
find almost everything.” 

“Everything except water, eh?” 
She was tapping a cigarette on a 
polish-reddened thumbnail. As he 
lit it for her, Johnny McCord 
realized that he hadn’t seen fin- 
gernail polish for a year. He 
decided it was too long. 

“Even water, in some parts,” 
he said. “There’s more water than 
most people realize. For instance, 
the Niger, which runs right 
through a considerable part of 
the Sahara, is the eleventh largest 
river in the world. But until our 
commission went to work on it, 


it dumped itself into the Gulf of 
Guinea, unused.” 

“The Niger is a long way from 
here,” she said through her smoke. 

He nodded. “For that matter, 
though, we have a certain amount 
of rain, particularly in the high- 
land regions of the central massif. 
In the past, with no watershed at 
all, it ran off, buried itself in the 
sands, or evaporated.” 

“Mr. McCord,” she said, “you 
are amazingly optimistic. For- 
merly, I must admit I had little 
knowledge of the Sahara Re- 
forestation Commission. And I 
deliberately avoided studying up 
on the subject after receiving this 
assignment, because I wanted first 
impression to be received on the 
spot. However, I’ve just driven 
across the Sahara. My impression 
is that your Commission is one 
great — Comment dit-on? — boon- 
doggling project, a super-W.P.A. 
into which to plow your Ameri- 
can resources and manpower. It 
is a fake, a delusion. This part 
of the world has never been any- 
thing but wasteland, and never 
will be.” 

Johnny McCord heard her out 
without change in expression. 

He’d been through this before. 
In fact, almost every time a 
junketing congressman came 
through. There was danger in the 
viewpoint, of course. If the fan- 
tastic sums of money which were 
being spent were cut off, such 


18 


GALAXY 


pessimistic views would become 
automatically correct. 

He took the paperweight from 
a stack of the correspondence on 
his desk and handed it to her. 

She looked at it and scowled 

very prettily, but still a scowl. 

“What is this? It’s a beautiful 
piece of stone.” 

“I picked it up myself,” Johnny 
said. “Near Reggan. It’s a chunk 
of petrified wood, Miss Desage. 
From a tree that must have 
originally had a diameter of some 
ten feet. Not quite a redwood, of 
course, but big.” 

“Yes,” she said, turning it over 
in her hand. “I can see this part, 
which must have once been bark. 
But why do you show it to me?” 
“The Sahara was once a semi- 
tropical, moist area, highly wood- 
ed. It can become so again.” 

S HE put the piece of fossil back 
on his desk. “How long ago?” 
she said bluntly. 

“A very long time ago, ad- 
mittedly. During the last Ice Age 
and immediately afterwards. But, 
given man’s direction, it can be 
done again. And it must be.” 

She raised pencilled eyebrows 
at him. “Must be?” 

Johnny McCord shifted in his 
chair. “You must be aware of the 
world’s population explosion, Miss 
Desage. The human race can’t 
allow three and a half million 
square miles of land to be value- 


less.” He grunted in deprecation. 
“And at the rate it was going, it 
would have been four million be- 
fore long.” 

She didn’t understand. 

Johnny spelled it out for her. 
“A desert can be man-made. 
Have you ever been in the 
Middle East?” At her nod, he 
went on. “Visitors there usually 
wonder how in the world the an- 
cient Jews could ever have 
thought of that area as a land 
of milk and honey. On the face 
of it, it’s nothing but badlands. 
What was once the Fertile Cres- 
cent now looks like Arizona.” 
Helene Desage was frowning at 
him. “And you suggest man did 
this — not nature?” 

“The goat did it. The goat, and 
the use of charcoal as fuel. Along 
with ignorance of soil erosion and 
the destruction of the wonderful 
watershed based on the Cedars of 
Lebanon. Same thing applies to 
large areas of Libya and Tunisia, 
and to Morocco and Spain. Those 
countries used to be some of the 
richest agricultural areas of the 
Roman Empire. But you can’t 
graze goats, probably the most 
destructive animal domesticated, 
and you can’t depend on char- 
coal for fuel, unless you want to 
create desert.” 

“Those things happened a long 
time ago.” 

Johnny snorted. ‘When we first 
began operations, the Sahara was

going south at the rate of two 
miles a year. Goats prefer twigs 
and bark even to grass. They 
strip a country.” 

“Well,” the reporter said, shrug- 
ging shapely shoulders, “at any 
rate, the task is one of such mag- 
nitude as to be fantastic. Yes- 
terday, I drove for nearly eight 
hours without seeing even a 
clump of cactus.” 

“The route you traveled is 
comparatively untouched by our 
efforts, thus far,” Johnny nodded 
agreeably. “However, we’re slowly 
coming down from Algeria, up 
from the Niger, and, using the 
new chemical methods of freshen- 
ing sea water, east from Maure- 
tania.” 

He came to his feet and 
pointed out spots on the large 
wall map. “Our territory, of 
course, is only this area which 
once was called French West 
Africa, plus Algeria. The battle 
is being fought elsewhere by 
others. The Egyptians and Suda- 
nese are doing a fairly good job 
in their country, with Soviet Com- 
plex help. The Tunisians are 
doing a wonderful job with the 
assistance of Common Europe, 
especially Italy.” 

She stood beside him and tried 
to understand. “What is this area, 
here, shaded green?” 

He said proudly, “That’s how 
far we’ve got so far, heading 
north from the Niger. In the past, 


the desert actually came down to 
the side of the river in many 
places. The water was completely 
wasted. Now we’ve diverted it 
and are reforesting anywhere up 
to three miles a year.” 

“Three miles a year,” she 
scoffed. “You’ll take five centu- 1 
ries.” 

TTE shook his head and grinned. 

“It’s a progressive thing. 
Water is admittedly the big prob- 
lem. But as our forests grow, 
they themselves bring up the 
moisture content of the climate. 
Down in this area — ” he made a 
sweeping gesture over the map 
which took in large sections north 
of the Niger — “we’ve put in hun- 
dreds of millions of slash pine, 
which is particularly good for 
sandy soil and fast growing. In 
ten years you’ve gone from two- 
year-old seedlings to a respectable 
forest.” 

Johnny pointed out Bidon 
Cinq on the map. “At the same 
time we found what amounts to 
a subterranean sea in this area. 
Not a real sea, of course, but 
a water-bearing formation or 
aquifer, deep down under the sur- 
face of the earth — layers of rock 
and gravel in which large quan- 
tities of water are lying. The ! 
hydro-geological technicians who 
surveyed it estimate that it holds 
reserves of several billion tons of 
water. Utilizing it, we’ve put in 


several hundred square miles of 
seedlings and transplants of 
various varieties. Where there are 
natural oases, of course, we stress 
a lot of date palm. In rocky 
areas it’s acacia tortila. In the 
mountains we sometimes use 
varieties of the pinyon — they’ll 
take quite a beating but are a 
little on the slow-growing side.” 
She was looking at him from 
the sides of her eyes. “You’re all 
taken up by this, aren’t you Mr. 
McCord?” 

Johnny said, surprise in his 
voice. “Why, it’s my work.” 

Derek came sauntering in and 
scaled his sun helmet onto his 
own desk. “Good morning, Made- 
moiselle,” he said. And to Johnny, 
“Hiram, that city slicker from 
Timbuktu just came up with his 
posse.” 

Helene said, “What is this Si, 
Hiram and Reuben which you 
call each other?” 

Johnny smiled sourly, “In a 
way, Miss Desage, this is just one 
great tree farm. And all of us are 
farmers. So we make jokes about 
it.” He thought for a moment. 
“Derek, possibly you better take 
over with Mohammed. I want to 
get over to In Ziza with Reuben. 

“To see about the pumps?” 
Helene said innocently. 

Johnny frowned but was saved 
from an answer by the entrance 
of Mohammed Mohmoud. He 
was dark as a Saharan becomes 


dark, his original Berber blood 
to be seen only in his facial 
characteristics. He wore the 
rather flamboyant Mali Federa- 
tion desert uniform with an air. 

When he saw the girl, his eye- 
brows rose and he made the 
Moslem salaam with a sweeping 
flourish. 

Johnny said, “Mademoiselle 
Desage, may I present Captain 
Mohammed Mohmoud ould 
Cheikh, of the Mali desert 
patrol.” He added sourly, “The 
officer in charge of preventing 
nomads from filtering up from 
the south into our infant forests.” 
The Moslem scowled at him. 
“They could have come from the 
east, from Timissao,” he said in 
quite passable English. “Or even 
from Mauritania.” He turned his 
eyes to Helene Desage. “En- 
chante, Mademoiselle. Tres heur- 
eux de taire ta connaissance.” 

She gave him the full benefit 
of her eyes. “Moi aussi, Mon- 
sieur.” 

Johnny wasn’t through with 
the Malian officer. “There’s a 
hundred of them,” he snapped, 
“with several thousand head of 
goats and other livestock. It 
would have been impossible to 
push that number across from 
Mauritania or even from the east, 
and you know it.” 

A lighter complexion would 
have shown a flush. Mohammed 
Mohmoud’s displeasure was lim- 


20 


GALAXY

21 


ited in expression to a flashing 
of desert eyes. He said, “Wher- 
ever their origin, the task would 
seem to be immediately to de- 
stroy the animals. That is why 
my men and I are here.” 

Pierre Marimbert had entered 
while the conversation was going 
on. He said, “Johnny, weren’t you 
going over to In Ziza with me?” 
Helene Desage said, the tip of 
her right forefinger to her chin 
as she portrayed thought, “I can’t 
decide where to go. To this crisis 
of the Tuareg, or to the crisis of 
the pumps — whatever that is.” 
Johnny said flatly, “Sorry, but 
you’d just be in the way at 
either place.” 

Mohammed Mohmoud was 
shrugging. “Why not let her come 
with me? I can guarantee her 
protection. I have brought fifty 
men with me, more than a match 
for a few bedouin.” 

“Gracious,” she said. “Evidently 
I was unaware of the magnitude 
of this matter. I absolutely must 
go.” 

Johnny said, “No.” 

She looked at him appraisingly. 
“Mr. McCord,” she said, “I am 
here for a story. Has it occurred 
to you that preventing a Paris 
Match reporter from seeing your 
methods of operation is probably 
a bigger story than anything else 
I could find here?” She struck 
a mock post. “I can see the head- 
lines. Sahara Reforestation Au- 


thorities Prevent Journalists from 
Observing Operations." 

“Oh, Good Lord,” Johnny 
growled. “This should happen to . 
me, yet! Go on with Derek and 
the captain, if you wish.” 

piERRE Marimbert and John- ■ 
ny McCord took one of the 
faster helicopters, Pierre piloting. 1 
With French elan he immediately | 
raised the craft a few feet and 
then like a nervous horse it | 
backed up, wheeled about and 
dashed forward in full flight. 

Spread below them were the 
several dozen buildings which j 
comprised Bidon Cinq; surround- 
ing the buildings, the acres of 
palm and pine, eucalyptus and 
black locust. Quick-growing, dry- ! 
climate trees predominated, but 
there were even such as balsam 
fir, chestnut and elm. It made an 
attractive sight from the air. 

The reforestation projects 
based on Bidon Cinq were not all 
in the immediate vicinity of the 
home oasis. By air, In Ziza was 
almost 125 kilometers to the 
northeast. By far the greater part 
of the land lying in between was 
still lacking in vegetation of any ; 
sort. The hydro-geological en- 
gineers who had originally sur- 
veyed the area for water had ' 
selected only the best sections for 
immediate sinking of wells, place- 
ment of solar power pumps, and 
eventually the importation of 


two-year seedlings and three- and 
four-year-old transplants. The 
heavy auto-planters, brought in 
by air transport, had ground their 
w ay across the desert sands in 
their hundreds, six feet between 
machines. Stop, dig the hole, set 
the seedling, splash in water, art- 
fully tamp down the soil, move 
on another six feet, stop — and 
begin the operation all over again. 
Fifty trees an hour, per machine. 

In less than two months, the 
planters had moved on to a new 
base further north. The mob of 
scientists, engineers, water and 
forest technicians, mechanics and 
laborers melted away, leaving 
Johnny McCord, his two assis- 
tants, his half dozen punch-card 
machines, his automated equip- 
ment and his forty or fifty native 
workers. It was one of a hundred 
such centers. It would eventually 
be one of thousands. The Sahara 
covered an area almost the size 
of Europe. 

Johnny McCord growled, 
“Friend Mohammed seems quite 
taken with our reporter.” 

Pierre grinned and tried to 
imitate a New England twang. 
“Why not, Hiram? She’s the first, 
eh, women folks seen in these 
parts for many a day.” He looked 
down at the endless stretches of 
sand dunes, gravel and rock out- 
croppings. “Mighty dry farm land 
you’ve got around here, Hiram." 

Johnny McCord grunted. 


“Derek said the other day it’s so 
dry even the mirages are only 
mud holes.” He pointed with his 
forefinger. “There’s the first of 
our trees. Now, what pumps did 
you check?” 

Pierre directed the copter 
lower, skimmed not much higher 
than the young tree tops. Some 
of them had already reached an 
impressive height. But Johnny 
McCord realized that the time 
was not too distant when they’d 
have to replant. Casualties were 
considerably higher than in forest 
planting at home. Considerably 
so. And replanting wasn’t nearly 
so highly automated as the ori- 
ginal work. More manpower was 
required. 

“These pumps here seem all 
right,” he said to Pierre. 

“A little further north,” Pierre 
said. “I came in over the track 
there, from the road that comes 
off the main route to Poste Wey- 
gand. Yes, there we are. Look! 
Completely destroyed.” 

Johnny swore. The trees that 
had depended on that particular 
pump wouldn’t last a month, in 
spite of the fact that they were 
among the first set in this area. 

He said, “Go higher. We should 
be able to spot the complete 
damage with glasses. You saw 
twenty-two, you say?” 

“Yes, I don’t know how many 
more there might be.” 

There were twenty-five de- 


22 


GALAXY 


FARMER 


23 


stroyed pumps in all. And all of 
them were practically together. 

It was sheer luck that Pierre 
Marimbert had located them so 
soon. Had his routine check taken 
place in some other section of 
the vast tree development, he 
would have found nothing un- 
toward. 

“This isn’t nearly so bad as I 
had expected,” Johnny growled. 
He was scowling thoughtfully. 

“What’s the matter?” Pierre 
said. 

“I just don’t get it,” Johnny 
said. “Number onfe, nomads don’t 
carry dynamite, unless it’s been 
deliberately given them. Two, if 
it was given them by someone 
with a purpose, why only enough 
to blow twenty-five pumps? That 
isn’t a drop in the bucket. A 
few thousand trees, are all we’ll 
lose. Three, where did they come 
from? Where are their tracks? 
And where have they gone? This 
job wasn’t done so very long ago, 
probably within a week or two 
at most.” 

“How do you know that?” 

“Otherwise those trees affected 
would already be dying. At their 
age, they couldn’t stand the sun 
long without water.” 

Pierre said, his face registering 
disbelief, “Do you think it could 
be simple vandalism on the part 
of a small band of Tuareg?” 

“Sure, if the pumps had been 
destroyed by hand. But with ex- 


plosives? Even if your band of 
Tuareg did have explosives they 
wouldn’t waste them on a few 
Sahara Reforestation Commis- 
sion pumps.” 

“This whole thing just doesn’t 
make sense,” Pierre Marimbert 
decided. 

“Let’s land and take a look at 
one of those pumps," Johnny said. 
“You know, if you get the whole 
crew to work on this you might 
be able to replace them before 
we lose any of these transplants. 
It’s all according to how long ago 
they were destroyed.” 

IV 

T> ACK at Bidon Cinq again that 
afternoon, Johnny McCord 
was greeted by the native office 
assistant he’d left in charge while 
all three of the officers were 
gone. Mellor, at the Tissalit base, 
had made several attempts to get 
in touch with him. 

“Mellor!” Pierre grunted. “How 
do you Americans say it? Stuffed 
shirt!” 

“Yeah,” Johnny McCord said, 
sitting down to the telephone. 
“But my boss.” 

While Pierre was fishing two 
cans of beer from the refrigerator, 
Johnny dialed Tissalit. Kate’s 
face lit up the screen. Johnny 
said, “Hi. I understand the old 
man wants to talk to me.” 

“That’s right,” the girl said, 


24 


GALAXY 



and moved a switch. “Just a min- 
ute, Johnny.” 

Her face faded to be replaced 
by that of Mellor. Johnny noted 
that as usual the other wore a 
business suit, complete with white 
shirt and tie — in the middle of 
the Sahara! 

Mellor was scowling. “Where’ve 
you been, McCord?” 

“Checking some pumps near 
In Ziza,” Johnny said evenly. 

“Leaving no one at all at 
camp?” the other said. 

Johnny said, “There were at 
least a score of men here, Mr. 
Mellor.” 

“No officers. Suppose an 
emergency came up?” 

Johnny felt like saying, An 
emergency did come up, two of 
them in fact. That’s why we were 
all gone at once. But for some 
reason he decided against ex- 
plaining current happenings at 
Bidon Cinq until he had a clearer 
picture. He said, “There are only 
three of us here, Mr. Mellor. We 
have to stretch our manpower. 
Derek Mason had to go over to 
Amerene el Kasbach with Mo- 
hammed Mohmoud and his men 
to clear out those nomads and 
their livestock.” 

“What did they find? Where 
were the Tuareg from?” 

“They haven’t returned yet.” 
Automatically, Johnny took up 
his can of beer and took a 
swallow from it. 


Mellor’s eyebrows went up. 
“Drinking this early in the day, 
McCord?” 

Johnny sighed deeply, “Look, 
Mr. Mellor, Pierre Marimbert 
and I just returned from several 
hours in the desert, inspecting 
pumps. We’re dehydrated, so 
we’re drinking cold beer. It tastes 
wonderful. I doubt if it will lead 
either of us to a drunkard’s 
grave.” 

Mellor scowled pompously. He 
said finally, “See here, McCord 
— the reason I called — you can 
be expecting a reporter from one 
of the French publications — ” 

“She’s here.” 

“Oh,” Mellor said. “I just re- 
ceived notice this morning. Or- 
ders are to give her the utmost 
cooperation. Things are on the 
touchy side right now. Very 
touchy.” 

“How do you mean?” Johnny 
said. 

“There are pressures on the 
highest levels,” Mellor said, 
managing to put over the im- 
pression that these matters were 
above and beyond such as Johnny 
McCord but that he, Mellor, was 
privy to them. 

‘What pressures?” Johnny said 
wearily. “If you want me to 
handle this woman with kid 
gloves, then I’ve got to know 
what I’m protecting her against, 
or hiding from her, or whatever 
the hell I’m supposed to do.”

Mellor glared at him. “I’m not 
sure I always appreciate your 
flippancy, McCord,” he said. 
“However, back home the oppo- 
sition is in an uproar over our 
expenditures. Things are very 
delicate. A handful of votes could 
sway the continuance of the 
whole project.” 

Johnny McCord closed his 
eyes in pain. This came up every 
year or so. 

Mellor said, “That isn’t all. The 
Russkies are putting up a howl 
in the . Reunited Nations. They 
claim the West plans to even- 
tually take over all northwest 
Africa. That this reforestation is 
just preliminary to make the area 
worth assimilating.” 

Johnny chuckled sourly, “Let’s 
face it. They’re right.” 

Mellor was shocked. “Mr. Mc- 
Cord! The West has never ad- 
mitted to any such scheme.” 
Johnny sighed. “However, we 
aren’t plowing billions into the 
Sahara out of kindness of heart. 
The Mali Federation alone has 
almost two million square miles in 
it, and less than twenty million 
population. Already, there’s fewer 
people than are needed to exploit 
the new lands we’ve opened up.” 
Well, that brings up another 
point,” Mellor said. “The South- 
east Asia Bloc is putting up a 
howl too. They claim they should 
be the ones allowed to reclaim 
this area and that it should go 


into farmland instead of forest” 
“They’re putting the cart be- 
fore the horse,” Johnny said. “At 
this stage of the game, the only 
land they could use really profit- 
ably for farming would be along 
the Niger. We’re going to have to 
forest this whole area fifst, and 
in doing so, change the whole 
climate. Then it’ll . .” 

Mellor interrupted him. “I’m 
as familiar with the program of 
the Sahara Reforestation Com- 
mission as you are, I am sure, 
McCord. I need no lecture. See 
that Miss Desage gets as sympa- 
thetic a picture of our work as 
possible. And, for heaven’s sake, 
don’t let anything happen that 
might influence her toward writ- 
ing something that would change 
opinions either at home or in the 
Reunited Nations.” 

“I’ll do my best,” Johnny said 
sourly. 

The other clicked off. 

T>IERRE was handy with an- 
other can of beer, ready open- 
ed. “So Mademoiselle Desage is 
to be handled with loving care.” 
Johnny groaned, “And from 
what we’ve seen so far of Made- 
moiselle Desage, she’s going to 
take quite a bit of loving care 
to handle.” 

Outside, they could hear the 
beating of rotors coming in. Two 
helicopters, from the sound of it. 
Beer cans in hand they went over 


FARMER

to the window and watched them 
approach. 

“Derek and the girl in one, 
Mohammed in the other,” Pierre 
said. “Evidently our good captain 
left the messy work of butchering 
goats to his men, while he re- 
mains on the scene to be as 
available to our girl Helene as 
she will allow.” 

The copters swooped in, 
landed, the rotors came to a halt 
and the occupants stepped from 
the cockpits. The Arab ground 
crew came running up to take 
over. 

Preceded by Helene Desage, 
the two men made their way 
toward the main office. Even at 
this distance there seemed to be 
an aggressive lift to the girl’s 
walk. 

“Oh, oh, my friend,” Pierre said. 
“I am afraid Mademoiselle 
Desage is unhappy about some- 
thing.” 

Johnny groaned. “I think you’re 
right. But smile, Reuben, smile. 
You heard the city slicker’s 
orders. Handle her with all the 
care of a new-born heifer.” 

Helene Desage stormed 
through the door and glared at 
Johnny McCord. “Do you realize 
what your men are doing?” 

“I thought I did,” Johnny said 
placatingly. 

Derek and Mohammed Moh- 
moud entered behind her. Derek 
winked at Johnny McCord and 


made a beeline for the refrigera- 
tor. “Beer, everybody?” he said. 

Mohammed Mohmoud said, 
“A soft drink for me, if you 
please, Mr. Mason.” 

Derek said, “Sorry, I forgot. 
Beer, Miss Desage?” 

She turned and glared at him. 
“You did nothing whatsoever to 
prevent them!” 

Derek shrugged. “That’s why 
we went out there, honey. Did 
you notice how much damage 
those goats had done to the trees? 
Thousands of dollars worth.” 
Johnny said wearily, “What 
happened?” He sank into the 
chair behind his desk. 

The reporter turned to him 
again. “Your men are shooting 
the livestock of those poverty- 
stricken people.” 

Mohammed Mohmoud said, 
‘We are keeping an accurate 
count of every beast destroyed, 
Mr. McCord.” His dark face was 
expressionless. 

Johnny McCord attempted to 
explain to the girl. “As I told 
you. Miss Desage, goats are the 
curse of the desert. They prefer 
leaves, twigs and even the bark 
of young trees to grass. The Com- 
mission before ever taking on 
this tremendous project arranged 
through the Mali Federation 
government to buy up and have 
destroyed every grazing animal 
north of the Niger. It cost mil- 
lions upon millions. But our work 


28 


GALAXY 


couldn’t even begin until it was 
accomplished.” 

“But why slaughter the liveli- 
hood of those poor people? You 
could quite easily insist that they 
return with their flocks to what- 
ever areas are still available to 
them.” 

Derek offered her a can of 
beer. She seemed to be going to 
reject it, but a desert-born thirst 
changed her mind. She took it 
without thanking him. 

The lanky Canadian said 
mildly, “I tried to explain to her 
that the Tuareg aren’t exactly in- 
nocent children of the desert. 
They’re known as the Apaches of 
the Sahara. For a couple of thou- 
sand years they’ve terrified the 
other nomads. They were slave 
raiders, bandits. When the Com- 
mission started its work the 
other tribes were glad to sell 
their animals and take up jobs 
in the new oases. Send their kids 
to the new schools we’ve been 
building in the towns. Begin fit- 
ting into the reality of modern 
life.” 

Her eyes were flashing now. 
“The Apaches of the Sahara, eh? 
Bien sur! If I remember correctly, 
the American Apaches were the 
last of the Indian tribes which 
you Americans destroyed. The 
last to resist. Now you export 
your methods to Africa!” 

Johnny McCord said mildly, 
“Miss Desage, it seems to be 


the thing these days to bleed 
over the fate of the redman. Ac- 
tually, there are a greater num- 
ber of them in the United States 
today than there were when 
Columbus landed. But even if 
you do carry a torch for the 
noble Indian, picking the Apaches 
as an example is poor choice. 
They were bandit tribes, largely 
living off what they could steal 
and raid from the Pueblo and 
other harder working but less 
warlike Indians. The Tuareg are 
the North African equivalent.” 
“Who are you to judge?” she 
snapped back. “Those tribesmen 
out there are the last defenders 
of their ancient desert culture. 
Their flocks are their way of life. 
You mercilessly butcher them, 
rob their women and children of 
their sole source of food and 
clothing.” 

J OHNNY McCord ran his hand 
over his face in an unhappy 
gesture. “Look,” he said plain- 
tively. “Those goats and sheep 
have already been bought and 
paid for by the Commission. The 
Tuareg should have destroyed 
them, or sold them as food to be 
immediately butchered, several 
years ago. Where they’ve been 
hiding is a mystery. But they 
simply have no right to be in 
possession of those animals, no 
right to be in this part of the 
country, and, above all, no right 


FARMER 


29 


to be grazing in our transplants.” 
“It’s their country! What right 
have you to order them away?” 
Johnny McCord held up his 
hands, palms upward. “This 
country is part of the Mali Fed- 
eration, Miss Desage. It used to 
be called French Sudan and South 
Algeria. The government of the 
Federation gladly accepted the 
project of reforestating the 
Sahara. Why not? We’ve already 
succeeded in making one of the 
most poverty-stricken areas in the 
world a prosperous one. Far from 
there being unemployment here, 
we have a labor shortage. Schools 
have opened, even universities. 
Hospitals have sprung up. High- 
ways have been laid out through 
country that hadn’t even trails 
before. The Federation is boom- 
ing. If there are a few Tuareg 
who can’t adapt to the new 
world, it’s too bad. Their chil- 
dren will be glad for the change.” 
She seated herself stiffly. “I am 
not impressed by your excuses,” 
she said. 

Johnny shrugged and turned 
to Mohammed Mohmoud who 
had been standing silently 
through all this, almost as though 
at attention. 

Johnny said, “Did you learn 
where this band comes from? 
Where they had kept that many 
animals for so long without de- 
tection?” 

The Moslem officer shook his 


head. “They wouldn’t reveal 
that.” 

Johnny looked at Derek 
Mason. The Canadian shook his 
head. “None of them spoke 
French, Johnny. Or if they did, 
they wouldn’t admit it. When we 
first came up they looked as 
though they were going to fight. 
Happily, the size of the captain’s 
command made them decide 
otherwise. At any rate, they’re 
putting up no resistance. I let 
them know through the captain, 
here, that when they got back 
to Tissalit, or Timbuktu, they 
could put in a demand for re- 
imbursement for their animals — 
if the animals were legally theirs.” 

Johnny looked at the Malian 
officer again. “How come you’ve 
returned to camp? Shouldn’t you 
be out there with your men?” 

“There were a few things to 
be discussed,” the Moslem said. 
He looked significantly at the 
French reporter. 

Helene Desage said, “Let me 
warn you, I will not tolerate 
being sent away. I want to hear 
this. If I don’t, I demand you let 
me communicate immediately 
with my magazine and with the 
Transatlantic Newspaper Alliance 
for whom I am also doing a series 
of articles on the Sahara Refores- 
tation scheme.” 

Johnny McCord winced. He 
said, “There is nothing going on 
around here, Miss Desage, that is 


30 


GALAXY 


secret. You won’t be ordered 
away.” He turned to Mohammed 
Mohmoud. “What did you wish 
to discuss, Captain?” 

“First, what about the camels, 
asses and horses?” 

“Shoot them. Practically the 
only graze between here and Tis- 
salit are our trees.” 

“And how will they get them- 
selves and their property out of 
this country?” the reporter 
snapped. 

Johnny said wearily, “We’ll 
truck them out, Miss Desage. 
They and all their property. And 
while we’re doing it, we’ll feed 
them. I imagine, before it’s all 
over it will cost the Commission 
several thousand dollars.” He 
turned back to the desert patrol 
captain. “What else?” 

From a tunic pocket Moham- 
med Mohmoud brought a hand- 
gun and handed it to Johnny Mc- 
Cord. “I thought you might like 
to see this. They were quite well 
armed. At first I thought there 
might be resistance.” 

Johnny turned the automatic 
over in his hands, scowling at it. 
“What’s there to see that’s spe- 
cial? I don’t know much about 
guns.” 

Mohammed Mohmoud said, 
“It was made in Pilsen.” 

Johnny looked up at him. 
“Czechoslovakia, eh?” 

The other said, “So were most 
of their rifles.” 


Helene Desage snorted in dep- 
recation. “So, we’ll drag in that 
old wheeze. The red menace. 
Blame it on la Russie.” 

Johnny McCord said mildly, 
“We haven’t blamed anything on 
the Russkies, Miss Desage. The 
Tuareg have a right to bear arms, 
there are still dangerous animals 
in the Mali Federation. And they 
are free to purchase Czech weap- 
ons if they find them better or 
cheaper than western ones. Don’t 
find an exciting story where there 
is none. Things are tranquil here.” 
Helene Desage stared at him. 
So did Mohammed Mohmoud 
and Derek Mason for that matter. 

Only Pierre Marimbert real- 
ized Johnny McCord’s position, 
and he chuckled and went for 
more beer. 

V 

J OHNNY McCord was a man 
who didn’t like to be thrown 
out of routine. He resented the 
interference with his schedule of 
the past few days. By nature he 
was methodical, not given to in- 
spiration. 

All of which was probably the 
reason that he spent a sleepless 
night trying to find rhyme and 
reason where seemingly there 
was none. 

At dawn, he stepped from the 
door of his Quonset hut quarters 
and looked for a moment into the 


FARMER 


31 


gigantic red ball which was the 
Saharan sun. Neither dawn nor 
sunset at Bidon Cinq were spec- 
tacular, nor would they become 
so until the Sahara Reforestation 
Commission began to return 
moisture to desert skies. Johnny 
wondered if he would live to see 
it. 

He made his way over to the 
huge steel shed which doubled as 
garage and aircraft hanger. As 
yet, none of the native mechanics 
were stirring, although he could 
hear sounds of activity in the 
community kitchen. 

Derek Mason looked up from 
his inspection of Helene Desage’s 
air-cushion Land Rover. 

Johnny McCord scowled at 
him. “What in the hell are you 
doing here?” 

The lanky Canadian came erect 
and looked for a long moment at 
his superior. He said finally, 
soberly, “It occurs to me that 
I’m probably doing the same 
thing you came to do.” 

“What have you found?” 

“That a small bomb has been 
attached to the starter.” 

Johnny didn’t change expres- 
sion. It fitted in. “What else?” he 
said. 

Derek handed him a steel ring. 

Johnny McCord looked at it, 
recognized it for what it was and 
stuck it in his pocket. “Let’s go 
back to the office. Yell in to the 
cook to send some coffee over, 


and call Pierre. We’ve got some 
notes to check.” 

Mademoiselle Desage was a 
late riser. When she entered the 
office, the three Sahara Reforesta- 
tion Commission officers were 
already at work. 

She said snappishly to Johnny 
McCord, “Today I would like to 
see these destroyed pumps.” 
Johnny said, his eyebrows 
questioning, “How did you know 
they were destroyed?” 

“It doesn’t seem to be much of 
a secret. The story is all about 
the camp.” 

“Oh?” Johnny sighed, then 
drawled to Derek, “I say, S ; , you 
better go get the hired hand, we 
might as well finish this up so we 
can get back to work.” 

Derek nodded and left. 

Johnny McCord left the col- 
lator he’d been working with, 
went around behind his desk and 
sat down. “Take a chair, Miss 
Desage. I want to say a few 
things in the way of background 
to you.” 

She sat, but said defiantly, “I 
have no need of a lengthy lecture 
on the glories of the Sahara Re- 
forestation Commission.” 

“Coffee?” Pierre Marimbert 
said politely. 

“No, thank you.” 

Johnny said, his voice thought- 
ful, “I imagine the real starting 
point was back about 1957 when 
the Chinese discovered that a 


32 


GALAXY 


nation’s greatest natural resource 
is its manpower.” 

S HE frowned at him. “What in 
the world are you talking 
about?” 

He ignored her and went on. 
“Originally, appalled by the job 
of feeding over half a billion 
mouths, they had initiated a birth 
control plan. But after a year or 
two they saw it was the wrong 
approach. They were going to 
succeed, if they suceeded, in their 
Great Leaps Forward by utilizing 
the labor of every man, woman 
and child in the country. And 
that’s what they proceeded to do. 
The lesson was brought home to 
the rest of the world in less than 
ten years, when such other coun- 
tries as India and Indonesia failed 
to do the same.” 

Johnny leaned back in his chair, 
and his eyes were thoughtful but 
unseeing. “Even we of the west 
learned the lesson. The most 
important factor in our leader- 
ship was our wonderful trained 
labor force. As far back as 1960 
we had more than 65 million 
Americans working daily in in- 
dustry and distribution. Even the 
Russkies, with their larger popu- 
lation, didn’t begin to equal that 
number.” 

“What are you driveling 
about?” the reporter demanded. 

“To sum it up,” Johnny said 
mildly, “the battle for men’s 


minds continues and each of the 
world’s great powers has discov- 
ered that it can’t afford to limit 
its population — its greatest re- 
source. So population continues 
to explode and the world is cur- 
rently frantically seeking sources 
of food for its new billions. The 
Amazon basin is being made into 
a tropical garden; the Japanese, 
landless, are devising a hundred 
methods of farming the sea; Aus- 
tralia is debouching into its long 
unpopulated interior, doing much 
the same things we are here in 
the Sahara. The Chinese are over- 
flowing into Sinkiang, Mongolia 
and Tibet; the Russkies into 
Siberia. We of the west, with the 
large underdeveloped areas of 
the western hemisphere have not 
been so greatly pushed as some 
others. However, there is always 
tomorrow.” 

Derek entered with Captain 
Mohammed Mohmoud. The 
latter day Rudolph Valentino had 
a puzzled expression on his dark 
face. 

“Here’s the hired man, Hiram,” 
Derek drawled. 

The desert patrol officer 
nodded questioningly to the men 
and said, “Bonjour,” to Helene 
Desage. 

Johnny went on. “Yes, there’s 
tomorrow. And by the time we 
run out of Lebensraum in Brazil 
and Alaska, in Central America 
and the Argentine, in Texas and 


FARMER 


33 


Saskatchewan, we’re going to 
need the three million square 
miles of the Sahara.” 

She said in ridicule, “It will 
take you a century at least to 
reforest the desert.” 

“At least.” Johnny nodded 
agreeably. “And we’re willing and 
able to look that far ahead. Pos- 
sibly by that time our opponents 
will also be looking for new lands 
for their expanding peoples. And 
where will they find them? The 
advantage will be ours, Miss 
Desage.” 

Mohammed Mohmoud looked 
from one to the other, frowning. 
“What are we discussing?” he 
said. “I should be getting back to 
my men.” 

Derek yawned and said, “For- 
get about it, pal. You’re never 
going to be getting back to your 
men again.” 

T^HE desert patrol officer’s eyes 
widened. He turned his glare 
on Johnny McCord, “What is all 
this?” 

Johnny said, “I’ll tell it, 
Derek.” 

Helene Desage was as sur- 
prised as the Malian. “What is 
going on? Are you trying to 
whitewash yourselves by casting 
blame on this gentleman?” 

“Let me go on,” Johnny said. 
“Needless to say, there are con- 
flicting interests. The Soviet 
Complex obviously would as soon 


we didn’t succeed. However, wars 
are impractical today, and the 
Russkies and Chinese are taken 
up with their own development. 
The Southeast Asia bloc wouldn’t 
mind taking over here them- 
selves, they desperately need land 
already. But they aren’t our big- 
gest opponents. There’s another 
group even more involved — the 
colons of Algeria and Morocco 
and those of even such Mali cities 
as Dakar. I suppose it is this last 
element that you represent, Miss 
Desage.” 

She was staring unbelievingly 
at him now. 

“Their interest is to get the 
Sahara Reforestation Commission 
out of the way so that they can 
immediately exploit the area. 
They are interested in the now, 
not the potentialities of the 
future. They resent the use of 
the Niger for reforestation, when 
they could use it for immediate 
irrigation projects. They would 
devote the full resources of the 
Mali Federation and Algeria to 
seeking oil and minerals and in 
the various other - ways the 
country might be exploited. Fin- 
ally, they rather hate to see the 
western schools, hospitals, and 
other means used to raise the 
local living standards. They liked 
the low wage rates that formerly 
applied.” 

Johnny nodded. “Yes, I imag- 
ine that’s your angle.” 


34 


GALAXY 


Helene Desage stormed to her 
feet. “I don’t have to listen to 
this!” 

Derek said, “Honey, we sure 
aren’t holding you. You’re free 
to go any time you want. And 
you can take this pal of yours 
along with you.” He jerked his 
head contemptuously at Moham- 
med Mohmoud. 

Pierre Marimbert said, “Ma- 
demoiselle, we have no idea of 
where you two met originally, 
nor how close your relationship, 
but the captain should have, re- 
membered that I too am French. 
A gentleman, on first meeting a 
lady, would never, never address 
her as tu in out language.” 

Johnny sighed again and 
looked at his watch. “Other things 
pile up too, Miss Desage. You 
let slip a few moments ago that 
you knew about the pumps be- 
ing destroyed. You said the rumor 
was all around camp. But it 
couldn’t be. The only persons 
who knew about it were myself, 
Pierre and Derek. On top of that, 
there were no signs of bedouin or 
animals near the exploded pumps; 
the person who did the job must 
have come in an aircraft or air- 
cushion car. And, besides, we 
found the pin of a hand grenade 
in your land rover this morning. 
We had thought at first that 
dynamite had been used, but 
evidently you smuggled your 
much more compact bombs 


across the desert with you. Ob- 
viously, no one would have 
dreamed of searching your vehi- 
cle. 

“No, Miss Desage, it’s obvious 
that you detoured from the track 
on the way down from Poste 
Weygand, went over to In Ziza, a 
comparatively short distance, 
and blew up twenty-five of our 
pumps.” 

Johnny turned to the Malian 
officer now. “At the same time 
you were coordinating with her, 
you and whatever gang is hiring 
you. Someone supplied those 
Tuareg with the livestock and 
paid them to trek up here. You, 
of course, turned your back and 
let them through. The same some- 
one who supplied the livestock 
also supplied Czech weapons.” 

Helene Desage was still sput- 
tering indignation. “Ridiculous! 
Why? What would motivate me 
to such nonsense?” 

Johnny grimaced. “The whole 
thing makes a beautiful story at a 
time when the American govern- 
ment is debating the practicality 
of the whole project. You could 
do quite a sob story on the poor, 
poverty-stricken Tuareg having 
their livestock destroyed. Then, 
quite a tale about the bedouin 
raiding our pumping stations 
and blowing them up. And quite 
a tale about the Tuareg being 
armed with Czech weapons. Oh, I 
imagine before it was through 


FARMER 


35 


you’d have drawn a picture of 
civil war going on here between 
the nomads and the Commission. 
Blowing up your own car with a 
small bomb attached to the 
starter was just one more item. 
By the way, were you going to 
do it yourself? Or did you in- 
tend to allow one of our mechan- 
ics to kill himself?” 

She flushed. “Don’t be ridicul- 
ous. No one would have been 
hurt. The bomb is a very small 
one. More smoke and flash than 
anything else.” 

“Well, thanks for small favors,” 
Derek said sarcastically. 

gave up. “Very well,” she 
^ snapped. “There is nothing 
you can do. This whole project, 
as I said before, is nothing but 
American boondoggling, a way of 
plowing endless resources into a 
hole. Your real motivation is an 
attempt to prevent depression 
and unemployment in your 
country.” 

Pierre Marimbert said softly, 
“So you admit to this whole 
scheme to discredit us?” 

“Why not?” She turned to the 
door. “I will still write my articles. 
It’s my word or yours.” 

Derek grinned at her. “I think 
I could fall in love with you, 
honey,” he said. “Life would pro- 
vide few dull moments. However, 
you didn’t notice how nice and 
automated this office is. Card 


machines, electric typewriters, all 
the latest — including tape record- 
ers for office conversations. You 
talked too much, honey.” 

‘‘Cochon!’’ she shrilled at him. 
She whirled and was through the 
door. 

Johnny turned to Mohammed 
Mohmoud. “I guess the best thing 
for you would be to turn in your 
commission, Captain.” 

Dark eyes snapped. “And if I 
say no?” 

Johnny shook his head. “The 
Mali Federation passed some 
awfully strict laws when it was 
drawing up its constitution. 
Among them was one involving 
capital punishment for anyone 
destroying a source of water in 
the desert. Miss Desage did the 
actual work but you were hand in 
glove with her. I’d hate to have 
to report that to your superiors.” 
Derek jumped forward quickly. 
His hand snaked out and chopped 
the other’s forearm. The heavy 
military pistol fell to the floor, 
and the Canadian kicked it to 
one side. “Shucks,” he drawled, 
“the hired hand sure is tricky, 
ain’t he?” 

“Good Lord,” Johnny McCord 
said disgustedly, “I didn’t say I 
was going to report you. Just 
threatened to if you didn’t resign. 
Now get out of here, we’ve got 
work to do. I’m three days behind 
on my reports!”

THE STRAIT NAMED AFTER VITUS BERING 



E NGINEER Pyotr Mikhail- 
ovitch Borisov is, as his 
name clearly indicates, a 
Russian. Professionally he is a 
mining engineer who has special- 
ized in oil wells. He hopes to be 
an innovator. And he is a man 
with an obsession: cold weather. 
Cold weather, to him, is personi- 
fied by the Arctic Ocean. 

When he speaks about cold

recently said to one of the editors 
of the Literaturnaya Gazyeta, 
pointing to a map of the Arctic 
Ocean, “here in the north the 
Soviet Union is wide open to the 
cold air masses blowing in from 
the Arctic Basin. That is why 
almost half — in fact, 47 per 
cent — of Soviet earth is occu- 
pied by zones of eternal frost. 
Over three quarters of our terri- 
tory the temperature may drop 
to minus 40 degrees. 15 per cent 
is nothing but uninhabited wild 
tundra . The cold weather 
is a beast of prey that devours 
huge sums of money. The build- 
ing of factories, power plants and 
mines in the northeast of the 
Soviet Union — and in other 
countries where the climate is 
identical — is one and a half 
times or twice as expensive as in 
districts with a more temperate 
climate. In the U.S.S.R. cold 
weather eats up, on the average, 
10 per cent of the country’s in- 
vestments.” 

And what about the losses sus- 
tained yearly by the cessation of 
marine and river transport dur- 
ing the winter? Not to mention 
the northern sea route, the most 
labor-consuming and most ex- 
pensive marine communication 
in the world? 

“The Arctic Ocean is to blame, 
in the main, for the fact that rice 
frequently fails to ripen in North 
Japan and that the north part of 


the Yellow Sea freezes over . 
More than any other country, 
except the U.S.S.R., the United 
States suffers from the frigid 
blasts blowing down from the 
Arctic Ocean. Alaska is a land of 
severe frosts. The chilly climate 
of the Arctic Basin pierces the 
very heart of the United States 
. Then there is Canada with 
its vast areas of tundras and 
eternal frosts.” 

The conclusion to be drawn 
from these facts is simple to 
Engineer Borisov: “We must melt 
the ice sheet of the Arctic Ocean.” 

As to how this ice sheet 
formed, he has his own theory 
too: “It is not because the waters 
of the oceans are so cold. The 
fault lies not with the ocean it- 
self, but with the rivers that flow 
into it: the Ob, Lena and Yenisei, 
among others. Their fresh waters 
are lighter than the salty water 
of the ocean . they form an 
upper mixed layer which freezes 
over and forms an ice sheet 
blocking the warmth of the 
deeper waters.” 

His idea is that, once this ice 
sheet is melted and the Arctic 
Ocean is open water, the solar 
radiation which is normally re- 
flected by the ice and snow 
would be absorbed by the water. 
This, of course, would not trans- 
mute the Arctic Ocean into a 
warm sea. But it should amelio- 
rate the climate of all the coun- 


38 


GALAXY 


tries that reach beyond or even 
near the Arctic Circle. 

U P to this point everybody is 
more or less in agreement with 
Borisov. If the Arctic Ocean were 
open water, the climate would 
improve. Nor would there be 
much danger of flooding, because 
the ice in question is not piled 
high on land masses, like the 
Greenland ice and the ice of Ant- 
arctica, but is floating on water. 
So the volume change if it were 
melted would be rather minor. 

The disagreement begins at 
the next stop, which is whether 
it can be done at all and how it 
could be done. 

Borisov thinks that the solu- 
tion is a dam across the Bering 
Strait. The width of the Bering 
Strait is 46 miles and the average 
depth is about 150 feet. Borisov 
admits that this would be a big 
dam. (His estimate of the cost 
is 70 billion rubles of the old 
Soviet currency. In the new So- 
viet currency it would be 7 bil- 
lion rubles or 14 billion rubles, 
depending on whether you go by 
the proclaimed value or by the 
gold content.) But he is firm in 
asserting that it would not be an 
impossible dam. 

But the dam would be only 
the first phase. It is meant to be a 
barrier stopping uncontrolled 
flow through the Bering Strait. 
After the dam has been built, 


Borisov wants to install gigantic 
pumps in several places — the 
published versions of his idea are 
by no means clear about the lo- 
cations of these pumps — which 
are to remove large amounts of 
water from the Arctic Ocean. 
This removal should be made in 
such a manner that the cold cur- 
rents now impeding the Gulf 
Stream would disappear, or at 
least be greatly weakened, so 
that the Gulf Stream can enter 
the Arctic Ocean between Green- 
land and Norway and melt the 
surface ice. 

Borisov’s compatriot, scientist 
D. A. Drogaytsev, writing in the 
journal Priroda (“Nature”), 
doesn’t think that scheme could 
possibly work. The only thing 
that probably could be done 
would be to build the dam itself. 
But this would cause “irreparable 
harm.” To the north of the dam 
the Arctic ice would clog the sea 
completely and make it unnavi- 
gable all year round. The ice 
would also clog up all the north- 
flowing rivers of Siberia, and thus 
destroy the value as transport 
arteries which they now possess 
except during the winter months. 
More, the accumulation of ice 
along the North Siberian coast 
would chill the land and extend 
the Gobi desert and other Asian 
deserts all the way north to the 
coastline, destroying areas now 
fertile. Such tampering with na-

39 


ture, Drogaytsev is positive, can 
only be bad. 

Whether this will stop the dis- 
cussion is something I would not 
dare to predict. But I want to 
add that another discussion about 
the Bering Sea, in the United 
States, interested as important a 
scientist as Charles P. Steinmetz. 

Interestingly enough, the idea 
to which Steinmetz devoted some 
time (I do not know whether it 
was completely his own) is the 
precise opposite of Borisov’s 
plan. Instead of closing the Ber- 
ing Strait with a dam it should 
be opened wider. 

Look at a map of the Arctic. 
Both the American continent and 
the Asian continent extend penin- 
sulas, the Seward Peninsula on 
the American side and the Chu- 
kotski Peninsula on the Siberian 
side. The narrowest distance be- 
tween them is 46 miles, as has 
been mentioned. And to the 
south of the Bering Strait there is 
St. Lawrence Island, looking al- 
most like a displaced stopper. 

Now, it was said, the fairly 
warm Japan current comes up 
from the South, passing by the 
Japanese Islands and flowing in 
such a way that it would go into 
the Arctic Ocean, if St. Lawrence 
Island and the two peninsulas 
did not block its way. 

If the island and large portions 
of the two peninsulas could be 
removed, widening- Bering Strait 


from 46 to about 200 miles, the 
Japan current would keep going 
North. Probably it would split 
into two currents, one going east- 
ward around Alaska, the other 
bearing westward along the Si- 
berian coast. In time the waters 
of this current would melt the 
floating ice and make the Arctic 
Ocean an open sea. 

Of course the job of removing 
hundreds of square miles of land 
is even bigger than Borisov’s dam. 
But there might be a chance of 
helping the Japan current in a 
more gentle manner, such as 
dredging flow channels for it, or 
even helping the flow along by 
artificial means. 

At any event the Bering Strait 
— and what might, or should, or 
should not, be done with it — 
is going to be a lively theme in 
years to come. 

ONE WORLD - ONE LANGUAGE 

That piece, in the February 
1960 issue, brought a great deal 
of comment and for the first time 
in my life did I really under- 
stand that sign which you can see 
in some stores: “If you are dis- 
pleased, tell us; if you are pleased, 
tell others.” The ones who agreed 
with me did so loudly, whole- 
heartedly and so forth, in person. 
But I did not get .a single letter 
of agreement. However, I got a 
fair number of letters bawling 


40 


GALAXY 


me out. Of those who bawled me 
out one defended Interlingua and 
five or six defended Esperanto — 
or rather attacked me for not 
being in love with it. 

One of these was Harry Har- 
rison, whose letter follows here 
in full. I have something to say 
about his arguments in four 
places, so marginal notes follow 
after that. 

One planet — one language! I 
agree with you that it would be a 
nice idea if this were possible. I 
also agree with you that we will 
probably never have a single “Earth 
language.” (1) 

But there is a language that may 
be spoken by all Earthmen that is 
already in use today — and succeed- 
ing quite well. I am speaking of 
Esperanto, which language got quite 
a kicking around in your article. In 
the name of fair play I would like to 
present the other side of the case, 
some facts about Esperanto that are 
rarely heard. 

Esperanto is a constructed lan- 
guage that aims to replace no other 
languages. It works side-by-side with 
national languages. When you say 
it does not work, I am forced to 
state blankly that it does. In this 
single case I claim superior knowl- 
edge (I would be hard-pressed to 
find another one!) because I have 
used it successfully for over fifteen 
years. I can write and speak it with 
an automatic ease I have never been 
able to capture in any language other 
than my native English. I have sat 
in groups of up to twelve people 


where no two people shared the same 
national language, yet all enjoyed 
perfect communication with Esper- 
anto. I subscribe to a half dozen 
magazines from all over the world 
— out of the eighty-nine listed in 
the Esperanto yearbook. When I 
travel I find Esperantists in every 
city I visit. We are friends as soon 
as we meet, and speak a common 
language. 

The only thing wrong with Es- 
peranto is that it is new. The world 
has a high resistance to new ideas. 
In the U.S. we recognize the value 
of the decimal system and laugh at 
the density of the English with their 
shillings (divide by twenty) and 
pence (divide by twelve). Then we 
turn around and do our measuring in 
yards, feet and inches. How long 
has the metric system been in 
use? (2) 

You have two arguments against 
Esperanto, and I think they are both 
personal ones. When you read 
Esperanto it, “. sounded too 
silly.” To whom? Finnish is a night- 
mare to anyone but a Finn. Danes 
all sound like they are strangling 
to death when they talk. Esperanto 
has a J for the Y sound. Yes is 
spelled Jes — and is pronounced and 
means the same as in English. The 
people in the linguistic groups that 
are used to pronouncing J this way 
won’t find it strange. It is impossible 
to make every letter look familiar 
to every group. This goes for the 
supersigns as well. In English we say 
such and sure, making the letter 5 
stand for two different sounds. In 
Esperanto the such S is S. The sound 
that starts sure is S. Isn’t it easier to 
memorize one new letter than count- 


FOR YOUR INFORMATION 


41 


less words? These supersign letters 
(and there are only six) give 
Esperanto an exotic look that doesn’t 
exist in reality. Spoken, it sounds 
very much like Italian or Spanish. 
(3) 

The second thing you have against 
Esperanto is that most Esperantists 
“. can probably speak something 
else that I can.” Probably true — if 
they are Europeans. But how is your 
Cantonese, Arabian, Japanese or 
Serbo-Croatian? I have met and en- 
joyed pleasant conversation with 
native speakers of these languages 

— whose only second language was 
Esperanto. I have a good friend in 
Italy who speaks fair English. About 
as good as my Italian. We talk al- 
ways in Esperanto — though we 
have both put in thousands of hours 
of studying each other’s native lan- 
guage. (4) 

That’s the real kicker. You can 
learn Esperanto in no time flat. Both 
to read and to speak. It is simple but 
completely flexible. Irregular forms 
don’t make a language interesting 

— they just make it hard to learn. 
In Esperanto you take ten seconds 
to memorize the fact that the end- 
ings of all verbs in the past, present 
and future tenses are is, as and os 
respectively. Then you can use the 
saved time to increase your word 
knowledge and familiarity with the 
language. 

Esperanto may not be the world 
language — but it is the successful 
language the world could speak! 

— HARRY HARRISON 

Here are my notes to Harry 
Harrison’s letter: 


(1) I could say right here 
that we have no argument at all, 
since my discussion was about a 
language, natural or artificial, 
which would become the “earth 
language.” 

(2) The resistance to new 
ideas exists, of course, but it is 
not universal. It seems to depend 
on whether there is a feeling that 
this new idea is not really needed. 
In science (and also in com- 
merce) new ideas are accepted 
rather fast, if the new idea is 
one which makes the recipients 
feel that they needed it. 

(3) A few supersigns over 
letters do not disturb me at all, 
but it does disturb me when one 
of your Esperantists writes me a 
letter which begins Kara amigo. 
I shall not accept any explana- 
tion of any kind; this is wrong. 
Either I am male (which hap- 
pens to be the case) and then the 
address should be Karo amigo. 
Or else, if I were female, it should 
read Kara amiga. If Kara amigo 
is “right” Esperanto grammar, 
then its “right” grammar is 
wrong! 

(4) Harry, you are an intel- 
ligent man. You cannot have 
spent “thousands of hours” learn- 
ing Italian. I can prove it, too. 
You 11 admit that if you concen- 
trate ten minutes a day on learn- 
ing three words of a language 
you have learned them so thor- 
oughly that you’ll never forget 


42 


GALAXY 


them again. This, in one year, 
will net you a vocabulary of 1095 
words. In reality, because of the 
existence of identical or very 
similar words, your vocabulary 
will be around 1250 words. Then, 
at the end of the year, you can 
learn any grammar, even a com- 
plicated one, in a 40-hour week. 
Hence you spend 61 hours learn- 
ing 1250 words plus 40 hours 
learning the grammar which en- 
ables you to read a newspaper. 

The actual expenditure in time 
was 100 hours of concentration 
in the course of one year. Wheth- 
er this could be done in 100 con- 
secutive hours is something I 
can’t judge since I have never 
tried it. But you cannot possibly 
have spent “thousands of hours” 
on Italian and still feel uncertain 
when subjected to it! 

RE-TAKE OF THE 
DECEMBER COLUMN 

JUDGING from the response, 
J the column in the December 
issue proved extraordinarily pop- 
ular. Many readers had some- 
thing to say about it, and a fair 
number were able to contribute 
something which I would have 
liked to have known when I 
wrote it. Taking them in their 
original order, we first had the 
marine worm, the palolo which 
mates when the moon is right. 

You may remember that the 


islanders talked to Mr. Powell 
about Mbalolo levu and Mbalolo 
lailai, the “minor” and the “ma- 
jor” appearance. I’ll freely admit 
that my sources phrased their 
sentences in such a way that one 
could not tell which word meant 
which and I had the definite im- 
pression that they were not sure. 
Preferring to be unambiguous, I 
took a shot in the dark as to 
which meant “major” and which 
meant “minor.” Professor (of 
Linguistics and Anthropology ) 
Charles F. Hockett, at the mo- 
ment Carnegie Visiting Professor 
at the University of Hawaii, in- 
formed me that I missed: 

“The words levu and lailai are 
Fijian, and their meanings are 
just the reverse of what you as- 
sign in the article. Levu is ‘big’ 
or ‘major’; compare Viti levu, 
‘Major Fiji,’ the name of the 
largest island in the archipelago 
... In Fiji, at any rate, the ‘small’ 
appearance (lailai) precedes the 
‘large’ (levu). Two students of 
mine will be in Fiji for the Mba- 
lolo levu season this year; with 
luck we can find out what they 
taste like.” 

I am grateful to Prof. Hockett 
for the correction — and envious 
of his students. 

The response to the second 
section, Slow Lightning, consisted 
of half a dozen letters which all 
read as if they had been written 
by the same person. In each case

the man (or woman) who wrote 
the letter said, “Thank you for the 
article. About fifteen years ago, 

when I lived in I saw such 

a lightning ball but nobody ever 
believed me. I didn’t even talk 
about it any more, but now that 
I have this article . .” 

The stories themselves were 
just typical, as the following ex- 
ample (written by Mr. H. A. J. 
in Westfield, N. J.) shows: 

“Thirty-five years ago I was 
a camper in a boys camp in 
Chicopee, Pennsylvania. It was 
mid or late afternoon. I was sit- 
ting on my bunk next to an open 
window, looking outside at the 
general area of the camp quad- 
rangle which had just been in- 
undated by a severe thunder- 
storm. Because of the storm we 
were in our cabins rather than at 
an activity. All the windows of 
these cabins were usually kept 
open. Suddenly, I saw coming di- 
rectly toward me a ball of fire, 
yellow golden in color, about the 
size of a basketball. It was mov- 
ing fairly quickly ... in retro- 
spect I would guess that it was 
travelling 25 or 30 miles per 
hour. As I saw it heading toward 
my window I pulled my head 
back away from the opening in 
time to see it pass by my head, 
go through the cabin to the other 
side and out an opposite window 
. There was no damage to any- 
one in the cabin or to the cabin 


itself. The ball did not follow a 
conductor, at least I do not re- 
call any wiring going in the same 
direction. Perhaps the electrical 
inlet for the cabin was outside 
my window. I do not know. 
There was no noise whatsoever. 
This I do remember.” 

Another letter from a Cana- 
dian pilot added something new. 

He wrote me that a friend 
(presumably fellow pilot) of his 
was flying a fast fighter jet over 
British Columbia at an altitude 
of 48,000 feet. They were flying 
so high to avoid the tops of 
spectacular cumulonimbus tow- 
ers which were building up over 
the area. Because the cloud for- 
mations were so spectacular the 
friend of my correspondent took 
pictures. In a black thundercloud 
they saw (and photographed) a 
luminous object. “The second 
shot shows it obscured by a 
tongue of cloud but shining 
through it. The ball must have 
been about the size of an aircraft 
[remember that fighter planes are 
under discussion, not passenger 
liners] if the visual clues are con- 
sistent. Although it appeared to 
the eye to have well-defined 
edges, according to the witnesses, 
the photo shows it definitely 
fuzzy. Maybe they radiate in the 
ultraviolet or higher as well.” 
Apparently in the thunder- 
cloud building up a lightning ball 
did form. That there happened 


44 


GALAXY 


to be somebody around to see 
and to photograph it is a lucky 
coincidence but not new in itself. 
Lightning balls have been seen 
to fall out of clouds; hence they 
must have been in the clouds 
before. What is new is the esti- 
mate of size, which is about a 
dozen or more times larger than 
any lightning ball observed near 
the ground. 

Are they larger when forming 
and contract as they age? 

Or does the size correspond 
more or less to the ambient air 
pressure? Since the planes were 
at 48,000 feet to clear the tops 
of the towers this lightning ball 
may well have been at 42,000 
feet or thereabouts, where the air 
pressure is down to about 130 
millimeters of mercury. 

Too bad that with such a fas- 
cinating subject we have to de- 
pend on luck only! 

"WTITH reference to the third 
” section, Pinwheels under 
Water, Mr. Charles R. Tanner of 
Cincinnati, Ohio, wrote: “Dig up 
Charles Fort’s Book of the 
Damned Chapter XXI. It seems 
remarkable to me that the two 
phenomena should be noted in 
the same part of the world. 
When I first read the Book of the 
Damned I remember being im- 
pressed by this letter, which 
seemed to have a ring of truth 
that not one in a thousand of 


Fort’s phenomena do have. It 
stuck in my mind all these years 
for that reason.” 

Naturally I reached for Fort’s 
book. I have the one-volume 
edition published by Henry Holt 
in 1941. In that edition the 
twenty-first chapter of the Book 
of the Damned begins, on p. 270, 
with a letter that appeared in the 
now defunct magazine Knowl- 
edge on Dec. 28, 1883. With very 
minor condensations it reads as 
follows: “I am tempted to ask for 
an explanation of the following 
which I saw when on board the 
British India Company’s steamer 
Patna, while on a voyage up the 
Persia Gulf. In May, 1880, on a 
dark night, about 11:30 P.M., 
there suddenly appeared on each 
side of the ship an enormous 
luminous wheel, whirling around, 
the spokes of which seemed to 
brush the ship along. The spokes 
would be 200 or 300 yards long 
. Each wheel contained about 
sixteen spokes, and, although the 
wheels must have been some 500 
or 600 yards in diameter, the 
spokes could be distinctly seen 
all the way round. The phosphor- 
escent gleam seemed to glide 
along flat on the surface of the 
sea, no light being visible in the 
air above the water ... I may 
mention that the phenomenon 
was also seen by Captain Avern, 
of the Patna, and Mr. Manning, 
third officer.” 


FOR YOUR INFORMATION 


45 


The signature was “Lee Fore 
Brace,” and below that was a P.S. 
reading: “The wheels advanced 
along with the ship for about 20 
minutes.” 

It was probably the silly sig- 
nature which inspired somebody 
signing himself “A. Me. D.” to 
write a letter to the editor which 
contained the requested explana- 
tion: “It is that before 11:30 P.M. 
there had been numerous acci- 
dents to the ‘main brace’ and that 
it had required splicing so often 
that almost any ray of light 
would have taken a rotary 
motion.” 

In the issue dated January 25,' 
1884, the original correspondent, 
now signing his letter. “J. W. Ro- 
bertson,” complained: “I do think 
it’s rather unjust to say a man is 
drunk because he sees something 
out of the common.” 

Charles Fort, after meandering 
around for several pages in his 
characteristic and intensely an- 
noying manner, then does quote a 
few more cases of the same sort 
of phenomenon. 

One (the source is identified as 
Journal of the Royal Meteoro- 
logical Society, 28-29) states that 
Captain Hoseason of the ship 
Kilwa saw vast “ripples” of light 
appeared suddenly. “Ripple” fol- 
lowed upon “ripple.” The light 
was faint, appeared suddenly and 
died out gradually in about 
fifteen minutes. Time and place: 


April 4, 1901, about 8:30 P.M. 
in the Persian Gulf. 

Another one (from Nature, 
20-291) is a report by Captain 
Evans that Commander J. E. 
Pringle of H. M. S. Vulture had 
seen rapidly moving luminous 
waves or pulsations in the water. 
“On looking toward the east, that 
appearance was that of a revolv- 
ing wheel with a center on that 
bearing, and whose spokes were 
illuminated, and, looking toward 
the west, a similar wheel ap- 
peared to be revolving, but in the 
opposite direction.” (Commander 
Pringle considered the second 
wheel an optical illusion but was 
firm about the first one. He 
estimated the width of each shaft 
of light about 25 feet, the spaces 
between them about 100 feet. 
Duration of the phenomenon: 
about 35 minutes. Time: 9:40 
P.M. Location: Lat. 26° 26' N., 
Long. 53° IT E., in the Persian 
Gulf. The date was May 15, 1879. 

T^ORT stated that the Journal 
of the Royal Meteorological 
Society (32-280) contained ex- 
cerpts from a letter written by 
Mr. Douglas Carnegie saying that 
in 1906 he saw a bank of appar- 
ently quiet phosphorescence. But 
when the ship came close, “shafts 
of brilliant light came sweeping 
across the ship’s bows . These 
light bars were about 20 feet 
apart and most regular . They 


46 


GALAXY 


first struck us on our broadside 
and I noticed that an intervening 
ship had no effect on the light 
beams: they started away from 
the lee sides of the ship just as if 
they had travelled right through 
it.” 

The place was the Gulf of 
Oman, the entrance to the Per- 
sian Gulf. 

Fort has two more cases, one 
with the date of June 5, 1880, off 
the coast of Malabar and one 
with the date of March 14, 1907, 
in the Malacca Strait. The 
Malabar coast is the western 
coast of the Indian Peninsula, 
the direct continuation of the 
coastline which is the eastern 
shore of the Persian Gulf and 
the Gulf of Oman. The Malacca 
Strait is the water separating the 
Malay Peninsula from Sumatra. 

I wish to state that I did not 
have the time to check the sources 
given by Fort. It is therefore pos- 
sible that Fort, by condensing 
and shortening the reports, left 
out detail which to other eyes 
than his would have been signifi- 
cant. He does mention that Mr. 
Carnegie scooped up a bucket of 
water during the event and later 
examined samples under a mi- 
croscope without finding anything 
unusual. He also mentions that 
Commander Pringle reported the 
sea “before and after the display” 
as having floating patches of fish 
spawn. 


Of the seven cases just men- 
tioned (the seventh is, of course, 
the one reported by Commander 
Bodler and quoted in the De- 
cember issue) just one is geo- 
graphically far removed from the 
other six, the one from the 
Malacca Strait. It differs from 
others also as to the time of day, 
or rather of night, since it was 
seen at 2 A.M. All others were 
seen before midnight. 

From the few reports available 
a few patterns emerge. One has 
just been mentioned: the phe- 
nomenon is usually seen between 
the beginning of darkness and 
midnight. 

The second pattern is the time 
of the year. The one seen from 
the ship Kilwa occurred on April 
4; the one seen from board of 
the Vulture on May 15. The one 
seen from the ship Patna was also 
in May. The phenomenon off the 
Malabar coast dates June 5. The 
one from the Gulf of Oman is

Commander Bodler’s case oc- 
curred on November 14, 1949. It 
is the only one in Fall. All others 
that are dated (including the 
Malacca Strait case which was in 
March) were seen in Spring or 
late Spring. 

But the most interesting pat- 
tern is the geographical one. 

Of a total of seven known, four 
were seen in the Persian Gulf, 
one in the Gulf of Oman (a di-

rectly adjacent body of water) 
and one off the Malabar coast — 
which is still an adjacent body 
of water, though a considerable 
distance away when expressed in 
miles. Does the Persian Gulf differ 
in any respect from other bodies 
of water? Yes, there is one dif- 
ference. It has a higher salinity. 
The three bodies of water with 
the highest salinity are the Dead 
Sea in Palestine, the Great Salt 
Lake in the United States and the 
Bay of Kara-Bogaz-Gol, on the 
eastern shore of the Caspian Sea. 
But they are all unconnected with 
the oceans. The Persian Gulf has 
the highest salinity of any body 
of water accessible from the 
ocean. And, of course, it has a 
hot climate. 

The concentration of the sight- 
ings in a very salty arm of the 
sea and the concentration in the 
Spring may be of importance. As 
I said in the December issue, it is 
my impression that it was a bio- 
logical phenomenon which was 
seen. 

But even this suggestion is in 
the nature of a wild guess. 

The only truthful thing one can 
say is that we don’t know. 


ANY QUESTIONS? 

Please find enclosed an article 
about radiation danger in space 
from today’s New York Times 


(Nov. 27, 1960.) I would ap- 
preciate it very much if you told 
me your personal opinion of 
whether radiation danger in space 
will prevent manned space travel. 

Elizabeth, New Jersey 

Dorothy Steinfeld 

Well, my personal opinion 
about this (and a few other 
things) is that the purpose of a 
difficulty is that it should be over- 
come. But for the sake of the 
readers generally it should be ex- 
plained that we are dealing with 
several sources of radiation in 
space. To begin with, our Sun 
(and probably every other star) 
emits X-rays along with visible 
radiation, heat rays and radio 
waves. But our Sun is a very 
weak X-ray star. There may be 
other stars which are powerful 
X-ray stars; but that is a problem 
for the next generation. In short, 
the direct X-rays from our sun 
will be stopped by the skin of the 
vessel. 

The second source of radiation 
in space is what physicists still 
call by the German name of 
Bremsstrahlung. The term was 
originally coined by the discov- 
erer of the X-rays, Prof. Dr. 
Konrad Rontgen and since so few 
physicists dealt with this phe- 
nomenon on the one hand, and 
since it is hard to translate on the 
other hand, nobody bothered to 


48 


GALAXY 


invent an English term. The one I 
have used in magazine articles, 
namely “impact radiation,” seems 
to come closest. What happens is 
that X-rays are produced when an 
electron is stopped in its flight 
by a solid body. (That is what 
the German term coined by Dr. 
Rontgen means: Strahlung means 
“radiation” while bremsen means 
“to brake” or “to bring to a stop”) 
Such impact radiation will be 
produced by any solid body, in- 
cluding spaceships, in the Van 
Allen belt. However, Dr. James 
A. Van Allen, after whom the 
belts are named, believes that his 
outer belt could be penetrated 
fast enough so that comparatively 
little shielding would be needed. 
In fact the skin of the ship, plus 
its meteor bumper, would proba- 
bly be thicker than is needed to 
make a radiation shield for this 
particular danger. 

What has just been said was 
mainly with reference to the outer 
of the two Van Allen belts. The 
inner belt is likely to be nastier. 
But it can easily be avoided, since 
it reaches only from about 40° 
northern to about 40° southern 
latitude. 

The current worry deals with 
sudden outbursts of protons from 
our sun. Satellite Explorer VII, 
in November 1960, ran into a 
proton burst where an average of 
10,000 protons per square centi- 
meter per second were encoun- 


tered. Earlier bursts, also reported 
by Explorer VII, had ranged from 
10 to 200 protons per square 
centimeter per second. That 
heavy burst amounted to about 
50 roentgens of radiation — an 
awful lot, since 450 roentgens 
is the dose which kills half of its 
victims within 30 days of ex- 
posure. 

The real problem, then, is 
these outbursts from the sun — 
partly because they can be lethal, 
partly because they do not seem 
predictable. Of course one can 
shield against them, but it would 
be a heavy weight which the ship 
would have to carry around. 
Some scientists have suggested 
what they half-jokingly called 
“storm cellars,” heavily shielded 
capsules aboard the ship, metal 
cocoons into which the crew mem- 
bers would slip as soon as the de- 
tectors begin to chatter. The un- 
solved problem here is whether 
these outbursts which come from 
the Sun just disappear into space 
or whether they are reflected 
back by magnetic fields far from 
the Sun, possibly outside the solar 
system. If they just come 
from the Sun and disappear into 
space with no reflection worth 
mentioning, the radiation shield 
could be very much like an old 
warrior’s shield, a heavy slightly 
curved metal plate which is al- 
ways held over the sunward side 
of the ship. 


FOR YOUR INFORMATION

Naturally a single shield of this 
kind would weigh much less than 
“storm cellars” for every crew 
member. And it would not inter- 
fere with operations, either. 

To find out whether we deal 
with a shielding problem in all 
direction or in one direction only 
is a special project called Project 
Ranger, which is slated to get un- 
derway in midsummer of 1961. 

In the past you have often 
written about forthcoming space 
events in your column. I notice 
that you don’t do this any more. 
Why? 

Albert Rezniczek 
Hollywood, Calif. 

In the past Galaxy was a 
monthly, which meant that less 
time went by between writing my 
column and its appearance on the 
newsstands. Also, in the past 
space events were much rarer 
than they are now. 

Just look what happened in 
August, 1960: Discoverer XIII 
was, as its name says, the 13th 
satellite that was fired into a 
polar orbit with the intent to 
recover its capsule. That this was 
intended was announced from 
the first shot on; but who could 
foretell that number thirteen 
would be the first one where re- 
covery would be successful? (The 
capsule was fished from the 
ocean.) That shot was made on 


August 10. On August 12 Echo 
went into orbit. Echo had also 
been in the planning stage for 
a long time. On August 18 
Discoverer XIV went into orbit, 
and its capsule was promptly 
recovered the next day. And on 
that day the Russians put Sputnik 
V into orbit — then recovered 
it (as a whole, even though the 
animal capsule was separated 
with a parachute after re-entry) 
on August 20. Only the daily 
paper can keep up now. And even 
the daily paper will limp some- 
what behind on occasion. 

But I can tell you about space 
events which are planned suffi- 
ciently far ahead so that you’ll 
be able to read this before the 
newspapers make headlines out 
of them: 

The manned capsule ( Project 
Mercury ) is due in Fall, 1961; 
though the program has shown 
some slippage it may still meet 
its own deadline. For 1962, 
several interplanetary unmanned 
probes are planned ( Project 
Mariner ) for both Mars and 
Venus. For 1963, Project Sur- 
veyor is planned. This involves 
the “soft” landing of a 600-pound 
instrument capsule on the moon. 
Most likely Wernher von Braun’s 
Saturn will put communications 
satellites into the 24-hour orbit 
during the same year. For 1964, 
Project Voyager is foreseen, larger 
and more sophisticated probes to 


50 


GALAXY 


j^Iars and Venus with the hope 
that they can be actually landed. 
For 1965, we have Project Pros- 
pector, the landing of a small 
mobile tank-like vehicle on the 
moon which can be directed to 
move around and TV-scan what- 
ever gets in its way. For 1966 or 
1967 we expect Project Rover, 
the nuclear-powered rocket, to go 
into space; and for 1967 or 1968 
w e expect Project Apollo to do 


its job, which is a manned flight 
around the moon without land- 
ing. 

And we better hurry Project 
Apollo (and everything else) . 
or one of the pictures taken by 
the crew of Project Apollo will be 
a nice sharp photograph of a lunar 
structure with a name like Ziol- 
kovsky Base or Soviet Outpost 
No. 1.

favorite writers. May IF still on sale - don t miss it! 



There are worse things than 
coming down with an epidemic 
— like not catching it, and 
filling in for those who do! 





I ’D forgotten how The Pit 
smells. I’d also forgotten my 
nose filters. The second I 
opened the door to HUM/OXY 
the stink hit me like a tidal wave. 
It was all coming back to me — 

I hadn’t been away that long. 

They were all there, every 
shape, size and color; clambering, 
sweating, shoving, clutching their 
records in their wet hands, get- 
ting sick from their shots. They 
probably thought it smelled, too. 

I gagg e d my way through to the 
main desk and past the gate. The 
receptionist jerked up, annoyed. 

“Hey! You’ll have to get to 
the end of the — oh! Yes? ’ She 
spotted my white and gray T-12 
rating and added: “ — sir? 

“I’m Steuberk,” I said, trying 
to hold my breath, “filling in for 
some jerk with the plague. Where 
am I? I mean, where am I sup- 
posed to be?” 

She consulted a list. “Oh. Mr. 
Steuberk. Room 909.” She looked 
at me queerly. 

“No nose filters, Mr. Steu- 
berk?” 

“Do!” I choked, “Do dose 
vilders. You hab sub?” 

“No,” she said, “but I’m sure 
Miss Cress will. Why didn’t you 
use the back lift, sir?” 

“I haben’t bid — I haven’t 
been here for a long time, miss! 

I snapped. 

She glanced at the rating again, 
and blushed slightly. “Oh. No, of 

53 


course not, sir. In there and to 
your right, Mr. Steuberk. Go right 


TT wasn’t much better in the 
inner hall. They were there, 
too, half a dozen at each door, 
waiting for their interviews. I 
found 909, went in, and leaned 
weakly against the door. 

“Filters, miss, filters!” 

The girl at the desk looked up, 
frowning. Then understanding 
dawned on her pretty face. She 
slit one of the little packages with 
her nails and handed it to me. 
I jammed them up my nostrils 
and took a deep breath. Better. 

“I’m Steuberk,” I said, “filling 
in for — for — ” 

“Mr. Harris,” she said. “I’m 
Leeta Cress.” 

She was a long-legged ash 
blonde with black eyes. The way 
the eyes tilted she was probably 
a Cythian Hybrid, Showgirl Class. 
What she was doing as a T-4 
secretary is anybody’s guess. 

“Yes, Mr. Steuberk?” One eye- 
brow tilted defiantly. 

“Oh. Yes. Well — let’s get on 
with it, shall we?” 

“Yes,” she said, “let’s do that.” 

I went around to my own desk, 
which was at right angles to hers. 

I took out a cigarette, lit it and 
nodded to Miss Cress. She pressed 
a button and spoke into her in- 
tercom. 

“Number K dash four-four- 


eight-one-six. You may come 
now, please.” 

I pulled the top folder from 
the stack on my desk, noted the 
number was correct, and opened 
it. There was one paper in the 
folder, the Preliminary History 
Form CC-4. It was absolutely 
blank. I frowned at Miss Cress. 

“I know,” she shrugged. “All 
the T-l Clerks are out too, Mr, 
Steuberk. We’ll just have to start 
from scratch.” 

“Just what,” I asked curiously, 
“is the matter with you people? 
Don’t you take your shots down 
here?” 

She nodded. “It’s something 
MED/SEC didn’t catch in the 
last ship. Kripstian Trot, I think.” 
I bit my cigarette. “Kripstian 
Trot, Miss Cress?” It sounded 
awful. “What does it do?” 

Miss Cress reddened. “Mr. 
Steuberk, I’d rather not — ” 

I waved her off. “Okay, okay. 
Forget it.” 

We were saved by the door. 
There was a hesitant knock, and 
Miss Cress released the lock from 
her desk panel. In they came. 

I’ve seen ’em all. I’ve been 
with REF/RELIEF, IMM/EM 
and RELOC since the war ended 
fifteen years ago. I’ve pulled my 
way up the bureaucratic ladder 
from T-2 Lice Jockey to Counse- 
lor. I’ve worked in a hot suit in 
the COLEOP/METH tanks and 
I’ve even (as a T-3, of course) 


hosed out the Sleepers. I thought 
I’d managed a long time ago to 
keep my feelings out of my work. 
I have ’em, all right. We all do, 
or we wouldn’t be here. But we 
know we’re here to help people, 
n0 t feel sorry for them, and you 
learn pretty quick that pity is a 
very infectious disease. 

I couldn’t help it. It was im- 


possible not to feel sorry for the 


sad-looking creatures that filed in 
through the door. There were 
four of them, two adults and two 
children. Officially, they were 
Refugees, Bipedal, Humanoid, 
Oxygen-breathers. Unofficially — 
they were a mess. 

I’ll try to explain it: If frogs 
were blue, and if blue frogs had 
orange hair covering their bodies, 
and if blue, orange-haired frogs 
came down with a bad case of 
poison ivy and mange — they’d 
be standing in my office, molting 
all over the floor. 

I looked at Miss Cress and she 
swallowed hard. 

“Names, please?” she asked. 


fTVHE tall male shuffled forward 


J. 




a step. He was dressed like 
the others, in a faded smock 
patched and washed to the limit 
of endurance. He was bent at the 
waist, and his shoulders sloped 
in a deep curve toward his hollow 
chest. He looked as if he were 
carrying a heavy, invisible load 
on his back. They all did. 


GALAXY THE GRAYBES OF RAATH 


“Name’s Graybe, ma’am. I’se 
Sut, this here’s Sari, and the 
youngun’s is Joak an’ Luti.” 

I bit my lip and looked down 
at my desk. I recognized the ac- 
cent the minute he opened his 
mouth. This was going to be a 
tough one. Getting a refugee, a 
misplaced person, . back to his 
home world is bad enough. Most 
of them wouldn’t be here if they 
still had worlds to go to. But 
that was nothing compared to 
Sut Graybe and his family. They 
were migratory workers — a pre- 
war phenomenon now extinct — 
unwanted, unsponsored, un-any- 
thing. I might convince someone 
to put Sut on a quota list — at 
the bottom — in \ about twenty 
years. 

“What’s your home planet, Mr. 
Graybe?” I asked. I knew we 
might as well toss out the forms 
on this one. The Labor Corps 
was already overcrowded, and 
there aren’t many decent jobs a 
live organism can do any more as 
well or as cheap as a robot. And 
those that are left require 
stronger stuff than the Graybes. 
The only hope we had was find- 
ing his own world — if it still 
existed — and trying to get him 
back among his own. 

Sut Graybe hesitated a mo- 
ment, glanced at his feet and 
said: 

“Well, suh, I reckon we’s born 
on Raath, suh, ’cept fer the kids. 


54 


55 


Course thass a long time ago, 
warn’t it, Sari?” His wife nodded 
solemnly. The two children gazed 
wide-eyed about the. room, cling- 
ing to their mother’s drab gray 
smock. 

Miss Cress verified the spelling, 
and ran “Raath” through the 
tapes. In a moment we had four- 
teen possibilities, allowing for 
phonetic latitude and pronuncia- 
tion. Nine we ruled out immedi- 
ately. They could not support an 
oxygen-breather. One, “Rayyt,” 
had no intelligent life, and an- 
other, “Wretsh,” had belonged to 
the Enemy — and it was now a 
bright light around the beak of 
Cygnus. That left three. 

Slides of the native life and 
geography of Ritk, Ratiki and 
Root brought definite noes from 
the Graybes. We were stuck on 
the ground. 

“I don’t suppose you know the 
coordinates of Raath, Mr. Gray- 
be?” '• ‘ 

The question brought nothing 
but bewilderment to the faces of 
Sut and Sari. 

“Sector? System? Nearby 
stars?” Nothing. I turned to Miss 
Cress. “Maybe it’s uncatalogued.” 

Miss Cress chewed thought- 
fully on her knuckle a moment, 
then shook her head. “Have to be 
pretty old, Mr. Steuberk. Or real 
new.” 

“Yeah. Is there any other 
name for Raath, Sut? Do you 


ever call it by anything else?” 
Sut turned to his wife. “No 
suh, reckon not. Jest Raath — all 
we evah knowed.” 

Meanwhile, Miss Cress tele- 
faxed photos of the Graybes to 
ANTHRO/REC and brought us 
up against another blank. Gray, 
be’s race, as well as his world, 
was uncatalogued. Not that that 
was unusual. We’ve mapped 
maybe one-quarter of the galaxy 
and half of that’s still pretty wild 
and woolly. I looked at my watch. 
We were getting nowhere and 
there were plenty of others wait- 
ing. 

CUT Graybe continued to be 
a goldmine of information. 
His home star was “kinda big an’ 
yeller” — I could have guessed 
that. He reckoned the constella- 
tions, as seen from Raath, were 
“right purty.” Swell. 

“Mr. Steuberk?” I turned to 
Miss Cress. She was making 
motions with her hands around 
her shoulders. I raised an eye- 
brow. They were nice shoulders, 
but I didn’t think she had any- 
thing like that in mind. 

“His tag, Mr. Steuberk,” she 
said firmly. 

“Oh.” I had forgotten the big 
paper ID card the refugees wear. 

I examined Sut’s. I shuddered 
and looked at Miss Cress. 

“Gomal,” I said. She looked 
away. 


“I didn’t think anyone got off 
Gomal,” I told Mr. Graybe. 

He shook his head, remember- 
ing- “Warn’t many, suh. Guess 
we ’s mighty lucky folks.” 

I guessed so too. I knew what 
had happened on Gomal. 

“What were you doing there, 
Sut?” 

“We’s pickin’ Skibi blossoms 

warn’t thet it, Sari? Them 

little purty pink ’uns?” Sari 
nodded sadly. 

“And before Gomal?” 

He answered readilly. “Fred- 
rickson Two. We’s bringin’ in the 
bananapple crop. Mighty hot, 
suh. Mighty hard work.” Sari 
nodded sadly. 

At least we were getting some- 
where. Slowly. Sut Graybe was 
able to remember working on 
Trev, Eynthion, Psyche, Vix, 
Ornsburg, Gryphon and about 
two dozen more. The Graybes 
had seen more worlds than a 
Navy Chief! 

About halfway through the 
second dozen something began to 
worry me. Even if you’re riding 
the Star Fields a lot of time 
passes between worlds, and I 
knew those big lunky Long- 
Sleepers took their time with a 
frozen human cargo. If he’d spent 
only a day or two on each world, 
even, he — 

“Mr. Graybe,” I asked sud- 
denly, “just what is your life- 
span?” 


He looked at me, puzzled. 
“Let’s put it another way. How 
long does the average — uh, do 
most people live on Rath?” 

His face brightened with un- 
derstanding. “Oh, yes, suh. Nine, 
ten hunnert years, ah reckon.” 

I sat up straight. “What?” 
Miss Cress bit her knuckle and 
the eyebrows went up again. 

“In Standard years, Mr. Gray- 
be? You know what a Standard 
year is, don’t you?” 

“Yes suh, reckon ah do that. 
’Bout four hunnert days, ain’t it?” 
“Uh, yes,” I said slowly. 
“That’s correct.” 

“Exactly how old are you then, 
Mr. Graybe?” asked Leeta 
Cress. 

He turned to his wife. “ ’Bout 
five hunnert, reckon.” He grinned. 
“I’se oldern’ Sari. ’Course she 
don’t like to ’zactly give her age 
— you know how wimminfolks 
is, ah reckon, ma’am.” 

I took a deep breath. Well, it 
was certainly not impossible. 
There are a few long-lived races 
in the Union, though I’d never 
heard of any humanoids over two 
or two-fifty. Still, it made sense 
— - if you wanted to look at it 
like that. It was the only way he 
could have seen all those worlds 
in one lifetime by LongSleeper. 

“You’re sure, Mr. Graybe? 
You’re sure it’s five hundred 
Standard years? You’re not using 
some other calendar?”

“No suh, reckon ah five hun- 
nert, all right.” He chuckled. 
“Feel like it sometimes, any- 
ways.” I took another look at 
him. It was possible all right . 

I scribbled a note on a piece of 
paper and handed it to Miss 
Cress. Then I wrote another one 
for the Graybes. Miss Cress 
frowned 'at me over her pretty 
nose. 

I ignored her. 

“Mr. Graybe,” I said, “I want 
you and your family to go to this 
room.” I handed him the paper. 
“Now. You’ll be told what to do 
there. Then I’d like to ask you 
to do one more thing. I want you 
and Mrs. Graybe to go back to 
the Camp, and I want you to list 
every world you’ve ever worked 
on, starting back with, uh — 
Korby, yes, that was the last one 
we got to. Do you think you can 
do that, Mr. Graybe?” 

He scratched his head and ran 
a long webbed hand over his face. 
“Ah shore try, suh. It been a heap 
a places, though.” 

I leaned toward him over my 
desk. “It would help a lot, Mr. 
Graybe, if you could just tell us 
the first world you worked on 
after Raath. Sure you can’t re- 
member that?” 

“Naw,” he said slowly, “it 
gonna take a little stewin’. Best 
ah Works back slow like, way 
we’s a-doin’ heah.” 

“Okay. You do the best you 


can. And come back at the same 
time tomorrow.” 

He nodded, and his shaggy 
brood dragged out after him. I 
turned to Leeta Cress. She was 
shaking her head slowly, like I 
was the boy who wrote the dirty 
word on the blackboard. 

“That just isn’t done. Mr, 
Steuberk,” she said darkly. 

“It isn’t, eh? You sent the 
order up the tube, didn’t you?” , 
“I did. But I don’t like it. You 
can’t go — shoving every other 
case to the head of the line. 
They’ll get a physical anyway, 
you know.” 

“Sure,” I said, “in about eight 
months. I want one now.” 

She let out a deep sigh. “All 
right, Mr. Steuberk, but it isn’t 
the way Mr. Harris would have 
handled it.” 

I scowled. “Mr. Harris has the 
Galloping Rot, Miss Cress.” 

“The Kripstian Trot, Mr. Steu- 
berk,” she sniffed. 

VW/ T E got through about half a 
" dozen more cases without 
much trouble. We closed up shop 
and I asked Leeta Cress if she’d 1 
care to have dinner with me and 
— bang — we were in trouble 
again. So I had dinner by myself 
and a few drinks in the Red 
Tape Bar. I couldn’t get the 
Graybes out of my mind. I made 
a note to have Research take a 
special look for Raath tomorrow,

just in case it had gotten mis- 
placed somewhere. I’ve worked in 
Research, too. We lost a whole 
System once behind a filing cab- 
inet. 

Meanwhile I had something 
else on my mind. Besides Miss 
Cress. I hopped a cab, rode across 
town and set down at the Star- 
Dome. It was late, and I didn’t 
figure any of the big brains would 
be using it this time of night. I 
went in, sat down before the big 
panel and pressed GENERAL 
VIEW. The lights dimmed and 
the round ceiling lit up with a 
panorama of the Galaxy. Before 
I left the office I had copied down 
the planets Graybe had already 
given us, and now I took my 
notebook out and punched the 
names into the board. I pressed 
for CLOSE-UP and the galaxy 
dropped down on top of me. 

Now I was looking at roughly 
one-quarter of the big lens, cen- 
tering in the Union. Everything 
was bright, sparkling and well- 
defined until the edge, which 
dimmed on out to places we 
hadn’t been, but could map, then 
on to a vague luminosity that was 
someone’s general idea of Ga- 
lactic Central. 

The planets I had coded ap- 
peared as oversize red dots on 
the map. I connected them with 
a thin white line, in order of 
Graybe’s migration, pulled a 
Tridi shield over my eyes, and 


brought the picture up as far as 
I could and still keep everyone in 
view. 

I now had a dimensional idea 
of Graybe’s travels — and it told 
me absolutely nothing. If there 
was any pattern or direction, it 
was related to the picking season 
of the Zidze nuts or some damn 
thing, and that wasn’t likely to 
show up on the StarDome. 

Before I went to bed I called 
a guy I knew in MED/SEC and 
asked him what the symptoms 
were of the Kripstian Trot. He 
was asleep and it served me right 
for asking. He told me. Well! 

I" used the back lift this time, 
and I didn’t forget my nose 
filters. There were two things 
waiting for me at the office: Miss 
Cress and a phone call. She 
handed me the number with a 
sugary smile, like Lucretia Borgia 
passing the cup. 

The call was from Zack Miles 
in MED/SEC. The screen showed 
a tired, basset-faced character 
with a crooked smile. 

He looked at me happily. “You 
been demoted, Steuberk? Not 
surprised.” 

“No,” I explained, “I’m filling 
in down here. Whole section’s out 
with — ” I caught Leeta Cress’- 
eye — “with, ah, this new dis- 
ease.” 

“Yeah.” He grinned nastily. “I 
know. ’Been up in Bio all morn- 


60 


GALAXY 


ing trying to catch it.” Miss 
Cress mouth opened and she fled 
the room. 

“Look,” said Zack, “about 
those characters — ” 

“Well?” 

He shrugged. “Too early to 
give you anything definite. They 
could be, mind you they could 
be, what they say. Just had time 
for a preliminary check. Can you 
get ’em back up here?” 

I promised I would and asked: 
“Is Sut Graybe really five hun- 
dred years old?” 

Zack scowled. “Let’s put it 
this way. He has the body of a 
not-too-well preserved man of 
fifty. If his life expectancy is one 
thousand, like he claims, then 
that would work out about right.” 
“But you don’t know for sure. 
Is that it?” 

“I don’t,” said Zack patiently, 
“because I haven’t finished the 
tests. But, yes — okay — prob- 
ably is. And I figure his ‘kids,’ if 
you’ll pardon the expression, are 
about eighty and a hundred. The 
woman won’t talk but she’s 
around four-fifty.” 

“Oh, yes,” I said seriously, “if 
she’s a day.” 

Zack ignored me. “Listen, Steu, 
where is this Raath, anyway?” 
“It’s a terrific place,” I said, 
“you live to be a thousand and 
all the girls have got the Krip- 
stian Trot.” 

He leered a second, daydream- 


ing, and hung up. I turned. Miss 
Cress was standing in the door. 
I grinned sheepishly. 

“You’ll just have to put up 
with me, Miss Cress. Harris still 
has the — ” Her hands clapped 
over her ears. I had a feeling we 
wouldn’t have that dinner tonight, 
either. 

The Graybes filed in about 
four — only six hours late. Sut’s 
eyes were droopier and more 
bloodshot than usual, and Sari 
didn’t look much better. Orange 
hair fluttered to the floor in great 
clumps. 

“Well, Sut, how did you do?” 
He shook his head doubtfully 
and handed me the list. “Sorry 
we’s late, suh, but me ’n Sari done 
our bes’, tryin’ to rec’lec all them 
places. We’s up all night, reckon.” 
“Oh, now, that wasn’t neces- 
sary Sut, we — ” I stopped. I had 
glanced down at the list. In a 
scrawly, crabbed hand, Sut had 
painfully set down, in reverse 
order, each planet he had visited, 
the approximate date, and in most 
cases the crops they picked. 

But that wasn’t what threw 
me. There were over two hundred 
and fifty names on the list. I 
clutched the paper tightly. 

“Are you sure, Sut? You’ve 
been to all these places? You’re 
not just making this up?” 

He looked pained. “No suh, ah 
ain’t. Reckon ah knows wheah ah 
been, all right, suh.” 


THE GRAYBES OF RAATH 


61 


I raised a hand in peace. 
“Okay. Okay, I believe you, Sut.” 
I glanced at the bottom of the 
list. Yuvor. 

“Well now we’re getting some- 
where,” I said. “Miss Cress, run 
Yuvor, Y-U-V-O-R, through the 
tapes. You’re sure this is the first 
world you hit after Raath, eh?” 
His eyes widened and he shook 
his head violently. Orange hair 
floated to every corner of the 
room. 

“No, suh! You don’ unnerstan’, 
suh!” 

I rubbed a hand wearily across 
my face. “What, Mr. Graybe, 
what don’t I understand?” 

“Well, suh, like ah said, we 
done our bes’, but we failin’ sleep 
fore we’s finished.” 

I didn’t say a word for a 
minute. I stared at Sut, then at 
Miss Cress. Miss Cress was defi- 
nitely better looking. 

“All right,” I said calmly as 
possible. “All right, Sut. You go 
back. Yes. You go back and finish 
the list. Then come back.” 

He grinned. The whole hairy 
crew shuffled out again. I laid my 
head in my hands. I looked at my 
watch. It was five. 

“Miss Cress . ?” 

She shook her head sweetly. 
“No, Mr. Steuberk.” 

T FOUGHT the temptation to 
run the new planets through 
the StarDome. I’d wait until Sut 


— correction: if Sut, finished his 
list. I skipped dinner and had a 
drink in the Red Tape Bar. I 
had two drinks. I had three — ■ 
oh, never mind. 

I couldn’t find the back lift in 
the morning. Miss Cress shook her 
pretty head sadly. “You look ter- 
rible, Mr. Steuberk.” 

I said, “Shut up, Miss Cress.” 
She ignored me. 

“They’re waiting for you,” she 
said. 

I looked up. It sounded omi- 
nous. “Who? The little men?” 
“No sir. The Graybes. With Dr. 
Zack.” She frowned. “Miles.” 

I lit a shaky cigarette. “Okay. 
Let’s get it over with.” 

Zack filed in after the Graybes, 
leered at Leeta and leaned over 
my desk. “You look terrible, 
Steu.” 

“I know. I’ve been informed.” 
He beamed hopefully. “You 
lucky devil, you don’t suppose 
you’re coming down with — ” 
“Never mind, it’s just a hang- 
over. Some doctor. Well, what 
did you find?” 

He shrugged. “It’s true. They 
are genuine long-lifers, all right. 
I borrowed a carbon-dater from 
Physics, tried it on a cell sample. 
They replace tissue about every 
seventy-five years.” 

I looked up. “Carbon-dater? I 
thought — ” 

He shook his head. “Course, 
the radioactivity involved is — ” 


62 


GALAXY 


“Never mind. I’ll take your 
word for it. Anything else?” 

He hesitated. “Maybe. Don’t 
know. The kids have a funny 
kind of squiggly line in their 
brain-wave pattern. The adults 
don’t.” 

“A funny squiggly line?” I said 
acidly. “Are you sure you’re a 
doctor, Zack?” 

Zack is not sensitive. He went 
on. I don’t know what it is. All 
I know is the kids have it — 
parents don’t. And I’d like to 
say you’ve advanced the science 
of Geriatrics tremendously — 
but I can’t. We’ve been over them 
pretty thoroughly. They’re old, 
all right. I just don’t know why.” 
“Okay,” I said, “stick around 
if you want to. If we ever find 
Raath, maybe you can ask the 
head man, the, uh — ” 
“Raathskeller?” 

I winced and turned to Sut. 
“Well, think you’ve got the whole 
thing now, Mr. Graybe?” 

He shuffled forward, handed 
me the list. “Ah reckon so, suh. 
Purt’ near busted mah haid, a- 
thinkin’ so much.” 

He crackled, nudging Sari in 
the ribs. I looked at the names. 
There were only about twenty 
additions. I hurried through, said 
the last name aloud. 

“Crohznar. Is that it, Sut? The 
first place you worked after 
Raath?” 

He nodded. “Yes suh, that it, 


awright. Tol’ble purty, too. We’s 
pickin’ them big ol’ Gushi buds 
an’ — ” 

I stood up. “Fine. Miss Cress?” 
“You want me to run Crohz- 
nar through the tape, Mr. Steu- 
berk?” 

“No. I want you to call us a 
cab for the StarDome. A big cab.” 
Miss Cress frowned. “Oh, we 
can’t close up like that, Mr. 
Steuberk, we — ” 

“Miss Cress,” I said darkly, 
“are you coming or aren’t you? 
Dr. Miles thinks I may be coming 
down with something. Any min- 
ute, now. Do you know what he 
thinks I have, Miss Cress?” 

She paled, bringing her hand to 
her face. 

“All right, then. Let’s get out 
of here.” 

W/T made a great picture trail- 
Y» ing up the steps to the 
StarDome. Zack, Leeta Cress, me 
and the molting Graybes. I sat 
them all down and had Zack feed 
me the names on the lists. 
Granted, I could have worked 
from Crohznar alone, but I 
wanted, if possible, to get a full 
directional picture of the trip 
from there to Gomal, where the 
Graybes were picked up. I pressed 
for CLOSE-UP again and a chor- 
us of Ooooohs and Aaaaaahs went 
up from the Graybes. 

I pulled the Tridi shield over 
my eyes and brought up the mag- 


THE GRAYBES OF RAATH

nification. They were all there. 
Gomal back to Crohznar and all 
points in between. The picture 
was a little clearer now, but not 
much. The Graybes hadn’t trav- 
eled in any orderly direction from 
Crohznar. They had gone where 
the work was, and the connecting 
white lines made a crazy pattern 
over half the Union. Still, there 
was a general, if ill-defined, drift 
from Sector II of the Union, 
where Crohznar was, “down- 
ward” toward Gomal. 

I called Sut to the panel, ex- 
plained the situation as well as 
I could and pulled a Tridi over 
his eyes. 

“Mighty purty,” said Sut. 

“Terrific. Now look, Sut, I’ve 
shown you where Crohznar is. 
And you can see the route you 
took to Gomal. You took pretty 
average hops all the way, so it 
stands to reason Raath is prob- 
ably about as far from Crohznar 
as your average jump. Does any- 
thing around there look famil- 
iar?” 

“No, suh. Sho’ don’t,” he said 
sorrowfully. 

“Nothing?” 

“No, suh. Jest a heap a purty 
lights, suh.” 

I slapped my head. “Okay, 
hold it, Sut.” I dialed a view of 
the constellations as seen from 
Crohznar. 

“Now, Sut? That’s the way the 
stars look from the first planet 


you worked on after Raath. 
Doesn’t anything look familiar?” 

He shook his head sadly. I 
pulled the Tridi off his eyes. I 
looked at Zack and Leeta Cress. 
They shrugged helplessly. 

I lit a cigarette and leaned 
toward Sut. “Now think,” I told 
him. “Can you remember how 
long it took to get from Raath to 
Crohznar? Did anyone on the 
LongSleeper ever mention how 
much Standard time, how much 
real time it would take? I know 
it was a long time ago, but try 
to remember.” 

Sut scratched his head and 
looked at me queerly. 

“Now what’s the matter?” I 
asked. 

“Well, suh, it jest ah can’t 
rightly tell how long they takes 
from Raath. Don’ see how ah 
kin.” 

I frowned. “Why not?” 

“Well, suh, we didn’ take no 
LongSleeper from Raath to that 
place.” 

I let out a deep breath. “Okay, 
Sut,” I said sarcastically, “how 
did you go? Plushline?” 

Sut thought that was a riot. 
“No, suh,” he laughed, “reckon 
not. Me ’n Sari, we swift-thunk 
it.” 

I could feel the hairs crawling 
up the back of my neck. 

“Swift-thunk?” 

“Yes, suh. Pickin’s was right 
pore on Raath, an’ we’s both 


64 


GALAXY 


purty young an’ spry, ’bout two 
hunnert, reckon. So we swift- 
thunk ’bout some nice place what 
had work fer us an’ we’s jus’ up 
and thar.” 

No one said a thing. Finally 
Zack broke the silence. 

“Steu? Is he trying to say what 
I think he’s trying to say?” 

I nodded. “Uh-huh.” My voice 
came out a little dry. “He thinks 
he and Sari teleported from 
Raath.” 

ONSENSE!” scoffed Zack, 
a little nervously for an 
honest-to-goodness scoff, “if they 
had any psi, operating or latent, 
we would have caught it on the 
tests. If they ever had it, they 
sure as hell don’t have it now.” 
“You talkin’ ’bout swift-think- 
in,’ suh?” Sut interrupted. “You 
right, suh, we ain’t got it no more. 
Can’t do it when you is old, suh. 
Reckon we done use all ours up 
a-gettin’ there,” he laughed. 

I turned slowly to Zack. 
“Those — squiggly lines?” 

He swallowed hard. “Yep.” 
“Sut,” I said, “ why didn’t you 
say something about this before?” 
“Didn’ ask, suh. Didn’t say 
nuthin’ ’bout swift-thinkin’. Jes’ 
wantin’ to know whar Raath is.” 
“If he’s telling the truth,” I 
said, “and I wish I could believe 
he isn’t — we might as well give 
up Raath. He doesn’t know where 
it is, either.” 


“What do you mean?” asked 
Zack. 

“If he swift-thu — teleported 
at random, he wouldn’t have any 
idea what Raath looks like from 
a distance, only what the rest of 
the sky looks like from Raath. 
And if he didn’t come from any- 
where near Crohznar — ” 

“Oh, ah ’spect we know our 
home when we see it, suh,” said 
Sut. 

That was too much. “Then 
you’re lying about the whole 
thing,” I yelled at him. “You 
couldn’t know!” 

“You don’ unnerstan’ bout us, 
I reckon,” he said. “We kinda 
feels whar home is, even ’haps 
we can’t see it. Gotta know, see, 
so we kin git back. Can’t do that 
no more; done used up all our 
swift-thinkin’, but can’t never fer- 
git. always got that, even if you 
can’t do nuthin’. Don’ know 
whar Raath is, suh, but if I’se 
evah to see it again, ’spect I’d 
surely know.” 

Zack, Leeta and I just looked 
at each other. No one said a 
word. 

Then Sut said: “Reckon you 
could brighten this here thing up 
more than you has it? Lemme 
take another peek? I’d be power- 
ful happy was I to find it ’gin.” 

I leaned over and boosted the 
magnification as far as it would 
go. 

For maybe two minutes, Sut

moved the scanner all over the 
StarDome. Then, a wide grin 
stretched over his face. 

“Sari, come look! There she is! 
Shore purty from here!” 

I moved up. Sut grabbed my 
arm and pulled me to the scan- 
ner. 

“There ’tis, suh. Right there. 
She look a lot different from 
heah, but that it, awright. See 
there? That bright, sorta fuzzy 
star ’neath thet big-n.” 

I looked. This time the chill 
started at my feet and kept going. 
“That — one, Sut?” 

“Yes suh, that it all right.” 

I pointed it out to Zack and 
Leeta. I grinned stupidly. 

“That one,” I said. 

“Mr. Steuberk?” 

“Yes, Miss Cress?” 

“Now.” 

“Now, what?” 

“Now,” she said, “I’m ready 


for that drink, Mr. Steuberk.” 

I don’t know what became of 
the Graybes of Raath. I’m not 
supposed to know. But I do know 
one thing — there are no Gushi 
buds to pick at Union Security 
Headquarters, so they must be 
up to something else over there. 

I imagine those boys have a few 
questions for Sut and Sari. And 
I’ll give you ten to one they don’t i 
have an answer between them. 
Maybe we’ll know when the 
Graybe kids reach maturity — . , 
in about a hundred years. I won’t, , 
of course, but Leeta and I’ll have 
some grandchildren who might. 

Every once in a while I burst 
out laughing just thinking about 
it. Do you suppose that sorry- 
looking, mangy-haired lout really 
did swift-think here from that 

fuzzy looking “star” 

from Andromeda?

E LPHEN DeBeckett lay 
dying. It was time. He had 
lived in the world for one 
hundred and nine years, though 
he had seen little enough of it 
except for the children. The chil- 
dren, thank God, still came. He 
thought they were with him now: 
“Coppie,” he whispered in a 
shriveled voice, “how nice to see 
you.” The nurse did not look 
around, although she was the 
only person in the room besides 
himself, and knew that he was 
not addressing her. 

The nurse was preparing the 
injections the doctor had ordered 
her to have ready. This little cap- 
sule for shock, this to rally his 
strength, these half-dozen others 
to shield him from his pain. Most 
of them would be used. DeBeckett 
was dying in a pain that once 
would have been unbearable and 
even now caused him to thresh 
about sometimes and moan. 

DeBeckett’s room was a great 
twelve-foot chamber with hang- 
ing drapes and murals that re- 
flected scenes from his books. The 
man himself was tiny, gnome- 
like. He became even less mate- 
rial while death (prosey biology, 
the chemistry of colloids) drew 
inappropriately near his head. 
He had lived his life remote from 
everything a normal man sur- 
rounds himself with. He now 
seemed hardly alive enough to 
die. 


69 




DeBeckett lay in a vast, pil- 
lared bed, all the vaster for the 
small burden he put on it, and 
the white linen was whiter for his 
merry brown face. “Darling 
Veddie, please don’t cry,” he 
whispered restlessly, and the 
nurse took up a hypodermic 
syringe. He was not in unusual 
pain, though, and she put it back 
and sat down beside him. 

The world had been gentle with 
the gentle old man. It had made 
him a present of this bed and 
this linen, this great house with 
its attendant horde of machines 
to feed and warm and comfort 
him, and the land on which stood 
the tiny, quaint houses he loved 
better. It had given him a park 
in the mountains, well stocked 
with lambs, deer and birds of 
blazing, spectacular color, a 
fenced park where no one ever 
went but DeBeckett and the be- 
loved children, where earth- 
moving machines had scooped 
out a Very Own Pond (“My 
Very Own Pond/Which I sing 
for you in this song/Is eight Hip- 
popotamuses Wide/ And twenty 
Elephants Long.”) He had not 
seen it for years, but he knew it 
was there. The world had given 
him, most of all, money, more 
money than he could ever want. 
He had tried to give it back 
(gently, hopefully, in a way 
pathetically), but there was al- 
ways more. Even now the world 


showered him with gifts and doc-, 
tors, though neither could prevail 
against the stomping pitchfire 
arsonist in the old man’s colon. 
The disease, a form of gastroen- 
teritis, could have been cured; 
medicine had come that far long 
since. But not in a body that 
clung so lightly to life. 

He opened his eyes and said 
strongly, “Nurse, are the children 
there?” 

The nurse was a woman of 
nearly sixty. That was why she 
had been chosen. The new medi- 
cine was utterly beyond her in 
theory, but she could follow di- 
rections; and she loved Elphen 
DeBeckett. Her love was the love 
of a child, for a thumbed edition 
of Coppie Brambles had bright- 
ened her infancy. She said, “Of 
course they are, Mr. DeBeckett.” 

He smiled. The old man loved 
children very much. They had 
been his whole life. The hardest 
part of his dying was that noth- 
ing of his own flesh would be 
left, no son, no grandchild, no 
one. He had never married. He 
would have given almost any- 
thing to have a child of his blood 
with him now — almost anything, 
except the lurid, grunting price 
nature exacts, for DeBeckett had 
never known a woman. His only 
children were the phantoms of 
his books . and those who 
came to visit him. He said faintly, 
“Let the little sweetlings in.” 


70 


GALAXY 


T HE nurse slipped out and the 
door closed silently behind 
her. Six children and three adults 
waited patiently outside, De- 
Beckett’s doctor among them. 
Quickly she gave him the di- 
mensions of the old man’s illness, 
pulse and temperature, and the 
readings of the tiny gleaming 
dials by his pillow as well, though 
she did not know what they 
measured. It did not matter. She 
knew what the doctor was going 
to say before he said it: “He can’t 
last another hour. It is astonish- 
ing that he lasted this long,” he 
added, “but we will have lost 
something when he goes.” 

“He wants you to come in. 
Especially you — ” She glanced 
around, embarrassed. “Especially 
you children.” She had almost 
said “little sweetlings” herself, but 
did not quite dare. Only Elphen 
DeBeckett could talk like that, 
even to children. Especially to 
children. Especially to these 
children, poised, calm, beautiful, 
strong and gay. Only the prettiest, 
sweetest children visited Elphen 
DeBeckett, half a dozen or a 
score every day, a year-in, year- 
out pilgrimage. He would not 
have noticed if they had been 
ugly and dull, of course. To De- 
Beckett all children were sweet, 
beautiful and bright. 

They entered and ranged 
themselves around the bed, and 
DeBeckett looked up. The eyes 


regarded them and a dying voice 
said, “Please read to me,” with 
such resolute sweetness that it 
frightened. “From my book,” it 
added, though they knew well 
enough what he meant. 

The children looked at each 
other. They ranged from four to 
eleven, Will, Mike, blonde Celine, 
brown-eyed Karen, fat Freddy 
and busy Pat. “You,” said Pat, 
who was seven. 

“No,” said five-year-old Freddy. 
“Will.” 

“Celine,” said Will. “Here.” 
The girl named Celine took the 
book from him and began obe- 
diently. “‘Coppie thought to her- 
self—’” 

“No,” said Pat. “Open.” 

The girl opened the book, em- 
barrassed, glancing at the dying 
old man. He was smiling at her 
without amusement, only love. 
She began to read: 

Coppie thought to herself that 
the geese might be hungry, for 
she herself ate Lotsandlots. 
Mumsie often said so, though 
Coppie had never found out 
what that mysterious food might 
be. She could not find any, so 
took some bread from Brigid 
Marie Ann-Erica Evangeline, 
the Cook Whose Name Was So 
Long That She Couldn’t Re- 
member It All Herself. As she 
walked along Dusty Path to 
Coppie Brambles’s Very Own 
Pond — 


A GENTLE DYING 


71 


Celine hesitated, looking at the 
old man with sharp worry, for 
he had moaned faintly, like a 
flower moaning. “No, love,” he 
said. “Go on.” The swelling soft 
bubble before his heart had 
turned on him, but he knew he 
still had time. 

The little girl read: 

— As she walked along Dusty 
Path to Coppie Brambles’s Very 
Own Pond, she thought and 
thought, and what she thought 
finally came right out of her 
mouth. It was a Real Gay 
Think, to be Thought While 
Charitably Feeding Geese: 

They don’t make noise like little 
girls and boys, 

And all' day long they’re aswim- 
ming. 

They never fret and sputter 
’cause they haven’t any butter, 
They go where the water’s 
wetly brimming. 

But say — 

Anyway — 

I 

Like 

Geese! 

There was more, but the child 
paused and, after a moment, 
closed the book. DeBeckett was 
no longer listening. He was 
whispering to himself. 

On the wall before him was 
painted a copy of one of the 
illustrations from the first edition 
of his book, a delightful picture 
of Coppie Brambles herself, feed- 


ing the geese, admirably showing 
her shyness and her trace of fear, 
contrasted with the loutish com- 
edy of the geese. The old man s 
eyes were fixed on the picture as 
he whispered. They guessed he 
was talking to Coppie, the child 
of eight dressed in the fashions 
of eighty years ago. They could 
hardly hear him, but in the silence 
that fell on the room his voice 
grew stronger. 

He was saying, without joy 
but without regret, “No more 
meadows, no more of the laughter 
of little children. But I do love 
them.” He opened his eyes and 
sat up, waving the nurse away. 
“No, my dear,” he said cheerfully, 
“it does not matter if I sit up 
now, you know. Excuse me for 
my rudeness. Excuse an old and 
tired man who, for a moment, 
wished to live on. I have some- 
thing to say to you all.” 

The nurse, .catching a sign 
from the doctor, took up another 
hypodermic and made it ready. 
“Please, Mr. DeBeckett,” she 
said. Good humored, he permitted 
her to spray the surface of his 
wrist with a fine mist of droplets 
that touched the skin and pene- 
trated it. “I suppose that is to 
give me strength,” he said. “Well, 
I am grateful for it. I know I 
must leave you, but there is 
something I would like to know. 
I have wondered . For years 
I have wondered, but I have not

r 

been able to understand the an- 
swers when I was told them. I 
think I have only this one more 
chance.” 

H E felt stronger from the fluid 
that now coursed through 
his veins, and accepted without 
fear the price he would have to 
pay for it. “As you know,” he 
said; “or, I should say, as you 
children no doubt do not know, 
some years ago I endowed a 
research institution, the Coppie 
Brambles Foundation. I did it 
for the love of you, you and all 
of you. Last night I was reading 
the letter I wrote my attorneys — 
No. Let us see if you can under- 
stand the letter itself; I have it 
here. Will, can you read?” 

Will was nine, freckled darkly 
on pale skin, red haired and 
gangling. “Yes, Mr. DeBeckett.” 
“Even hard words,” smiled 
the dying man. 

“Yes, sir.” 

DeBeckett gestured at the 
table beside him, and the boy 
obediently took up a stiff sheet 
of paper. “Please,” said De- 
Beckett, and the boy began to 
read in a high-pitched, rapid 
whine. 

“ ‘Children have been all my 
life and I have not regretted an 
instant of the years I devoted to 
their happiness. If I can tell them 
a little of the wonderful world in 
which we are, if I can open to 


them the miracles of life and liv- 
ing, then my joy is unbounded. 
This I have tried, rather selfishly, 
to do. I cannot say it was for 
them! It was for me. For nothing 
could have given me more pleas- 
ure.’ ” 

The boy paused. 

DeBeckett said gravely, “I’m 
afraid this is a Very Big Think, 
lovelings. Please try to under- 
stand. This is the letter I wrote 
to my attorneys when I instructed 
them to set up the Foundation. 
Go on, Will.” 

“ ‘But my way of working has 
been unscientific, I know. I am 
told that children are not less 
than we adults, but more. I am 
told that the grown-up maimers 
and cheats in the world are only 
children soiled, that the hagglers 
of commerce are the infant 
dreamers whose dreams were 
denied. I am told that youth is 
wilder, freer, better than age, 
which I believe with all my 
heart, not needing the stories of 
twenty-year-old mathematicians 
and infant Mozarts to lay a 
proof. 

“‘In the course of my work I 
have been given great material 
rewards. I wish that this money 
be spent for those I love. I have 
worked with the heart, but per- 
haps my money can help some- 
one to work with the mind, in 
this great new science of psy- 
chology which I do not under- 


A GENTLE DYING 


73 


stand, in all of the other sciences 
which I understand even less. I 
must hire other eyes. 

“ ‘I direct, then, that all of my 
assets other than my books and 
my homes be converted into cash, 
and that this money be used to 
further the study of the child, 
with the aim of releasing him 
from the corrupt adult cloak 
that smothers him, of freeing 
him for wisdom, tenderness and 
love.’” 

“That,” said DeBeckett sadly, 
“was forty years ago.” 

TTE started at a sound. Over- 
head a rocket was clapping 
through the sky, and DeBeckett 
looked wildly around. “It’s all 
right, Mr. DeBeckett,” comforted 
little Pat. “It’s only a plane.” 

He allowed her to soothe him. 
“Ah, loveling,” he said. “And can 
you answer my question?” 

“What it says in the ’Cyclo- 
pedia, Mr. DeBeckett?” 

“Why — Yes, if you know it, 
my dear.” 

Surprisingly the child said, as 
if by rote: “The Institute was 
founded in 1976 and at once 
attracted most of the great work- 
ers in pediatric analysis, who were 
able to show Wiltshauer’s Effect 
in the relationship between 
glandular and mental develop- 
ment. Within less than ten years 
a new projective analysis of the 
growth process permitted a re- 


orientation of basic pedagogy 
from a null-positive locus. The 
effects were immediate. The first 
generation of — ” 

She stopped, startled. The old 
man was up on his elbow, his 
eyes blazing at her in wonder and 
fright. “I’m — ” She looked around 
at the other children for help and 
at once wailed, “I’m sorry, Mr. 
DeBeckett!” and began to cry. 

The old man fell back, staring 
at her with a sort of unbeliev- 
ing panic. The little girl wept 
abundantly. Slowly DeBeckett’s 
expression relaxed and he man- 
aged a sketchy smile. 

He said, “There, sweetest. You 
startled me. But it was charming 
of you to memorize all that!” 

“I learned it for you,” she 
sobbed. 

“I didn’t understand. Don’t 
cry.” Obediently the little girl 
dried her eyes as DeBeckett 
stretched out a hand to her. 

But the hand dropped back on 
the quilt. Age, surprise and the 
drug had allied to overmaster the 
dwindling resources of Elphen 
DeBeckett. He wandered to the 
phantoms on the wall. “I never 
understood what they did with 
my money,” he told Coppie, who 
smiled at him with a shy, painted 
smile. “The children kept com- 
ing, but they never said.” 

“Poor man,” said Will absently, 
watching him with a child’s un- 
committed look.

The nurse’s eyes were bright 
and wet. She reached for the 
hypodermic, but the doctor shook 
his head. 

“Wait,” he said, and walked to 
the bed. He stood on tiptoe to 
peer into the dying man’s face. 
“No, no use. Too old. Can’t sur- 
vive organ transplant, certainty of 
cytic shock. No feasible therapy.” 
The nurse’s eyes were now flow- 
ing. The doctor said to her, with 
patience but not very much pa- 
tience, “No alternative. Only kept 
him going this long from grati- 
tude.” 

The nurse sobbed, “Isn’t there 
anything we can do for him?” 

“Yes.” The doctor gestured, 
and the lights on the diagnostic 
dials winked out. ‘We can let 
him die.” 

T ITTLE Pat hiked herself up 
^ on a chair, much too large 
for her, and dangled her feet. 
“Be nice to get rid of this furni- 
ture, anyway,” she said. ‘Well, 
nurse? He’s dead. Don’t wait.” 
The nurse looked rebelliously at 
the doctor, but the doctor only 
nodded. Sadly the nurse went to 
the door and admitted the adults 
who had waited outside. The four 
of them surrounded the body and 
bore it gently through the door. 
Before it closed the nurse looked 
back and wailed: “He loved you!” 

The children did not appear 
to notice. After a moment Pat 


said reflectively, “Sorry about the 
book. Should have opened it.” 
“He didn’t notice,” said Will, 
wiping his hands. He had touched 
the old man’s fingers. 

“No. Hate crying, though.” 
The doctor said, “Nice of you. 
Helped him, I think.” He picked 
up the phone and ordered a dem- 
olition crew for the house. “Mon- 
ument?” 

“Oh, yes,” said another child. 
“Well. Small one, anyway.” 

The doctor, who was nine, said, 
“Funny. Without him, what? A 
few hundred thousand dollars 
and the Foundation makes a flex- 
ible world, no more rigid adults, 
no more — ” He caught himself 
narrowly. The doctor had ob- 
served before that he had a tend- 
ency to over-identify with adults, 
probably because his specialty 
had been geriatrics. Now that 
Elphen DeBeckett was dead, he 
no longer had a specialty. 

“Miss him somehow,” said 
Celine frankly, coming over to 
look over Will’s shoulder at the 
quaint old murals on the wall. 
“What the nurse said, true 
enough. He loved us.” 

“And clearly we loved him,” 
piped Freddy, methodically sort- 
ing through the contents of the 
dead man’s desk. “Would have 
terminated him with the others 
otherwise, wouldn’t we?”

Odd planet! The bipeds talked from their 
heads and saw only what lay before them. 
In short, they were pathetic — and deadly! 


By R. A. LAFFERTY 

Illustrated by WOOD 


A S I am now utterly with- 
out hope, lost to my mis- 
sion and lost in the sight 
of my crew, I will record what 
petty thoughts I may have for 
what benefit they may give some 
other starfarer. Nine long days 
of bickering! But the decision is. 



sure. The crew will maroon me. 
I have lost all control over them. 

Who could have believed that 
I would show such weakness 
when crossing the barrier? By 
all the tests I should have been 
the strongest. But the final test 
is the event itself. I failed. 

I only hope that it is a pleas- 
ant and habitable planet where 
they put me down . 

Later. They have decided. I 
am no longer the captain even in 
name. But they have compassion 
on me. They will do what they 
can for my comfort. I believe 
they have already selected my 
desert island, so to speak, an out- 
of-the-way globe where they will 
leave me to die. I will hope for 
the best. I no longer have any 
voice in their councils . 

Later. I will be put down with 
only the basic survival kit: the 
ejection mortar and sphere for 
my last testament to be orbited 
into the galactic drift; a small 
cosmoscope so that I will at least 
have my bearings; one change of 
blood; an abridged universal 
language correlator; a compen- 
dium of the one thousand philo- 
sophic questions yet unsolved to 
exercise my mind; a small vial of 
bug-kill; and a stack of sexy mag- 
azines . 

Later. It has been selected. 
But my mind has grown so de- 
moralized that I do not even rec- 


ognize the system, though once 
this particular region was my spe- 
cialty. The globe will be habit- 
able. There will be breathable at- 
mosphere which will allow me to 
dispense with much bothersome 
equipment. Here the filler used is 
nitrogen, yet it will not matter. 
I have breathed nitrogen before. 
There will be water, much of it 
saline, but sufficient quantities of 
sweet. Food will be no problem; 
before being marooned, I will re- 
ceive injections that should last 
me for the rest of my probably 
short life. Gravity will be within 
the range of my constitution. 

What will be lacking? Nothing 
but the companionship of my own 
kind, which is everything. 

What a terrible thing it is to 
be marooned! 

/"WNE of my teachers used to 
^ say that the only unforgiv- 
able sin in the universe is inepti- 
tude. That I should be the first to 
succumb to space-ineptitude and 
be an awkward burden on the 
rest of them! But it would be 
disastrous for them to try to 
travel any longer with a sick 
man, particularly as their nomin- 
al leader. I would be a shadow 
over them. I hold them no rancor. 

It will be today . 

Later. I am here. I have no 
real interest in defining where 


78 


GALAXY 


“here” is, though I have my cos- 
moscope and could easily deter- 
mine it. I was anesthetized a few 
hours before, and put down here 
in my sleep. The blasted half- 
acre of their landing is near. No 
other trace of them is left. 

Yet it is a good choice and not 
greatly unlike home. It is the 
nearest resemblance I have seen 
on the entire voyage, which is to 
say that the pseudodendrons are 
enough like trees to remind me 
of trees, the herbage near enough 
to grass to satisfy one who had 
never known real grass. It is a 
green, somewhat waterlogged 
land of pleasant temperature. 

The only inhabitants I have 
encountered are a preoccupied 
race of hump-backed browsers 
who pay me scant notice. These 
are quadruped and myopic, and 
spend nearly their entire time at 
feeding. It may be that I am 
invisible to them. Yet they hear 
my voice and shy away somewhat 
from it. I am able to communicate 
with them only poorly. Their only 
vocalization is a sort of vibrant 
windy roar, but when I answer 
in kind, they appear more puzzled 
than communicative. 

They have this peculiarity: 
when they come to an obstacle of 
terrain or thicket, they either go 
laboriously around it or force 
their way through it. It does not 
seem to occur to them to fly over 


it. They are as gravity-bound as 
a newborn baby. 

What air-traveling creatures I 
have met are of a considerably 
smaller size. These are more vo- 
cal than the myopic quadrupeds, 
and I have had some success in 
conversing with them, but my re- 
sults still await a more leisurely 
semantic interpretation. Such 
communications of theirs as I 
have analyzed are quite common- 
place. They have no real philos- 
ophy and are singularly lacking 
in aspiration; they are almost to- 
tal extroverts and have no more 
than the rudiments of introspec- 
tion. 

Yet they have managed to tell 
me some amusing anecdotes. 
They are quite good-natured, 
though moronic. 

They say that neither they nor 
the myopic quadrupeds are the 
dominant race here, but rather a 
large grublike creature lacking a 
complete outer covering. From 
what they are able to convey of 
this breed, it is a nightmarish kind 
of creation. One of the flyers even 
told me that the giant grubs 
travel upright on a bifurcated 
tail, but this is difficult to credit. 
Besides, I believe that humor is 
at least a minor component of 
the mentality of my airy friends. 
I will call them birds, though they 
are but a sorry caricature of the 
birds at home. 


THE WEIRDEST WORLD 


79 


f ATER. I am being hunted. I 
am being hunted by the 
giant grubs. Doubling back, I 
have seen them on my trail, ex- 
amining it with great curiosity. 

The birds had given me a very 
inadequate idea of these. They 
are indeed unfinished — they 
do lack a complete outer cover- 
ing. Despite their giant size, I 
am convinced that they are grubs, 
living under rocks and in masses 
of rotten wood. Nothing in nature 
gives the impression of so lacking 
an outer covering as the grub, 
that obese, unfinished worm. 

These are, however, simple 
bipeds. They are wrapped in a 
cocoon which they seem never to 
have shed, as though their emer- 
gence from the larval state were 
incomplete. It is a loose artificial 
sheath covering the central por- 
tion of the corpus. They seem 
never to divest themselves of it, 
though it is definitely not a part 
of the body. When I have ana- 
lyzed their minds, I will know 
the reason for their carrying it. 
Now I can only conjecture. Ijt 
would seem a compulsion, some 
psychological bond that dooms 
them in their apparent adult state 
to carry their cocoons with them. 

Later. I am captured by three 
of the giant grubs. I had barely 
time to swallow my communica- 
tion sphere. They pinned me 
down and beat me with sticks. I 


was taken by surprise and was! 
not momentarily able to solve ^ 
their language, though it came to 
me after a short interval. It was 
discordant and vocal and en- 
tirely gravity-bound, by which 
I mean that its thoughts were 
chained to its words. There 
seemed nothing in them above 
the vocal. In this the giant grubs 
were less than the birds, even ! 
though they had a practical pow- 
er and cogency that the birds 
lacked. 

“What’ll we do with the blob?” 
asked one. 

“Why,” said the second, “you 
hit it on that end and I’ll hit it on 
this. We don’t know which end 
is the head.” 

“Let’s try it for bait,” said the 
third. “Catfish might go for it.” 
“We could keep it alive till 
we’re ready to use it. Then it ' 
would stay fresh.” 

“No, let’s kill it. It doesn’t look 
too fresh, even the way it is.” 
“Gentlemen, you are making a 
mistake,” I said. “I have done 
nothing to merit death. And I am 
not without talent. Besides, you 
have not considered the possi- 
bility that I may be forced to kill I 
you three instead. I will not die 
willingly. Also I will thank you to 
stop pounding on me with those 
sticks. It hurts.” 

I was surprised and shocked at 
the sound of my own voice. It 


w as nearly as harsh as that of 
the grubs. But this was my first 
attempt at their language, and 
musicality does not become it. 

“Hey, fellows, did you hear 
that? Was that the blob talking? 
Or was one of you playing a 
joke? Harry? Stanley? Have you 
been practicing to be ventrilo- 
quists?” 

“Not me.” 

“Not me either. It sure 
sounded like it was it.” 

“Hey, blob, was that you? Can 
you talk, blob?” 

ERTAINLY I can talk,” I 
responded. “I am not an 
infant. Nor am I a blob. I am a 
creature superior to your own 
kind, if you are examples. Or it 
may be that you are only chil- 
dren. Perhaps you are still in the 
pupa stage. Tell me, is yours an 
early stage, or an arrested devel- 
opment, or are you indeed adult?” 
“Hey, fellows, we don’t have 
to take that from any blob. I’ll 
cave in its blasted head.” 

“That’s its tail.” 

“It’s its head. It’s the end it 
talks with.” 

“Gentlemen, perhaps I can set 
you straight,” I said. “That is my 
tail you are thwacking with that 
stick, and I am warning you to 
stop it Of course I was talking 
with my tail. I was only doing it 
in imitation of you. I am new at 



the language and its manner of 
speaking. Yet it may be that I 
have made a grotesque mistake. 
Is that your heads that you are 
waving in the air? Well, then, I 
will talk with my head, if that is 
the custom. But I warn you 
again not to hit me on either end 
with those sticks.” 

“Hey, fellows, I bet we could 
sell that thing. I bet we could sell 
it to Billy Wilkins for his Rep- 
tile Farm.” 

“How would we get it there?” 

“Make it walk. Hey blob, can 
you walk?” 

“I can travel, certainly, but I 
would not stagger along precari- 
ously on a pair of flesh stilts with 
my head in the air, as you do. 
When I travel, I do not travel 
upside down.” 

“Well, let’s go, then. We’re go- 
ing to sell you to Billy Wilkins 
for his Reptile Farm. If he can 
use a blob, he’ll put you in one 
of the tanks with the big turtles 
and alligators. You think you’ll 
like them?” 

“I am lonesome in this lost 
world,” I replied sadly, “and even 
the company of you peeled grubs 
is better than nothing. I am anx- 
ious to adopt a family and settle 
down here for what years of life 
I have left. It may be that I will 
find compatibility with the spe- 
cies you mention. I do not know 
1 what they are.” 

“Hey, fellows, this blob isn’t a 


80

THE WEIRDEST WORLD 


81 


bad guy at all. I’d shake your 
hand; blob, if I knew where it 
was. Let’s go to Billy Wilkins’ 
place and sell him.” 

II 

WfE traveled to Billy Wilkins’ 
” place. My friends were 
amazed when I took to the air 
and believed that I had deserted 
them. They had no cause to dis- 
trust me. Without them I would 
have had to rely on intuition to 
reach Billy Wilkins, and even 
then I would lack the proper in- 
troductions. 

“Hey, Billy,” said my loudest 
friend, whose name was Cecil, 
“what will you give us for a 
blob? It flies and talks and isn’t 
a bad fellow at all. You’d get 
more tourists to come to your 
reptile show if you had a talking 
blob in it. He could sing songs 
and tell stories. I bet he could 
even play the guitar.” 

“Well, Cecil, I’ll just give you 
all ten dollars for it and try to 
figure out what it is later. I’m a 
little ahead on my hunches now, 
so I can afford to gamble on this 
one. I can always pickle it and 
exhibit it as a genuine hippopot- 
amus kidney.” 

“Thank you, Billy. Take care 
of yourself, blob.” 

“Good-by for now, gentlemen,” 

I said. “I would like you to visit 
me some evening as soon as I 


am acclimated to my new sur- 
roundings. I will throw a whing- 
ding for you — as soon as I find 
out what a whing-ding is.” 

“My God,” said Billy Wilkins, 
“it talks! It really talks!” 

“We told you it could talk and 
fly, Billy.” 

“It talks, it talks,” said Billy. 
“Where’s that blasted sign paint- 
er? Eustace, come here. We got 
to paint a new sign!” 

The turtles in the tank I was 
put into did have a sound basic 
philosophy which was absent in 
the walking grubs. But they were 
slow and lacking inner fire. They 
would not be obnoxious com- 
pany, but neither would they 
give me excitement and warmth. 
I was really more interested in 
the walking grubs. 

Eustace was a black grub, 
while the others had all been 
white; but like them he had no 
outside casing of his own, and 
like them he also staggered 
about on flesh stilts with his 
head in the air. 

It wasn’t that I was naive or 
hadn’t seen bipeds before. But 
I don’t believe anyone ever be- 
came entirely accustomed to see- 
ing a biped travel in its peculiar 
manner. 

“Good afternoon, Eustace,” I 
said pleasantly enough. The eyes 
of Eustace were large and white. 
He was a more handsome speci- 
men than the other grubs.

“That you talking, bub? Say, 
you really can talk, can’t you? 
I thought Mr. Billy was fooling. 
Now just you hold that expres- 
sion a minute and let me get it 
set in my mind. I can paint any- 
thing, once I get it set in my 
mind. What’s your name, blob? 
Have blobs names?” 

“Not in your manner. With us 
the name and the soul, I believe 
you call it, are the same thing 
and cannot be vocalized, so I will 
have to adopt a name of your 
sort. What would be a good 
name?” 

“Bub, I was always partial to 
George Albert Leroy Ellery. 
That was my grandfather’s 
name.” 

“Should I also have a family 
name?” 

“Sure.” 

“What would you suggest?” 
“How about McIntosh?” 

“That will be fine. I will use 
it.” 

T TALKED to the turtles while 
Eustace was painting my por- 
trait on tent canvas. 

“Is the name of this world 
Florida?” I asked one of them. 
“The road signs said Florida.” 
“World, world, world, water, 
water, water, glub, glug, glub,” 
said one of them. 

“Yes, but is this particular 
world we are on named Flor- 
ida?” 


“World, world, water, water! 
glub,” said another. 

“Eustace, I can get nothing 
from these fellows,” I called. “I 3 
this world named Florida?” 

“Mr. George Albert, you are 
right in the middle of Florida, 
the greatest state in the uni- 
verse.” 

“Having traveled, Eustace, J 
have great reservations that it is 
the greatest. But it is my new 
home and I must cultivate a loy- 
alty to it.” 

I went up in a tree to give ad- 
vice to two young birds trying 
to construct a nest. This was ob- 
viously their first venture. 

“You are going about it all 
wrong,” I told them. “First con- 
sider that this will be your home, 
and then consider how you can 
make your home most beautiful.” 

“This is the way they’ve al- 
ways built them,” said one of the 
birds. 

“There must be an element of 
utility, yes,” I told them. “But 
the dominant motif should be 
beauty. The impression of ex- 
panded vistas can be given by 
long low walls and parapets.” j 

“This is the way they’ve al- 
ways built them,” said the other 
bird. 

“Remember to embody new 
developments,” I said. “Just say 
to yourself, ‘This is the newest . 
nest in the world.’ Always say 


that about any task you attempt. 
It inspires you.” 

‘This is the way they’ve al- 
wa ys built them,” said the birds. 
"Go build your own nest.” 

“Mr. George Albert,” called 
Eustace, “Mr. Billy won’t like 
your flying around those trees. 
You’re supposed to stay in your 
tank.” 

“I was only getting a little air 
and talking to the birds,” I said. 

“You can talk to the birds?” 
asked Eustace. 

“Cannot anyone?” 

“I can, a little,” said Eustace. 
“I didn’t know anyone else 
could.” 

But when Billy Wilkins re- 
turned and heard the report that 
I had been flying about, I was 
put in the snake house, in a cage 
that was tightly meshed top and 
sides. My cellmate was a surly 
python named Pete. 

“See you stay on that side,” 
said Pete. “You’re too big for me 
to swallow. But I might try.” 
“There is something bothering 
you, Pete,” I said. “You have a 
bad disposition. That can come 
only from a bad digestion or a 
bad conscience” 

“I have both,” said Pete. “The 
first is because I bolt my food. 
The second is because — well, I 
forget the reason, but it’s my 
conscience.” 

“Think hard, Pete. Why have 
you a bad conscience?” 



WEIRDEST WORLD 


“Snakes always have bad con- 
sciences. We have forgotten the 
crime, but we remember the 
guilt.” 

“Perhaps you should seek ad- 
vice from someone, Pete.” 

“I kind of think it was some- 
one’s smooth advice that started 
us on all this. He talked the legs 
right off us.” 

"DILLY WILKINS came to the 
cage with another “man,” 
as the walking grubs call them- 
selves. 

“That it?” asked the other 
man. “And you say it can talk?” 
“Of course I talk,” I answered 
for Billy Wilkins. “I have never 
known a creature who couldn’t 
talk in some manner. My name is 
George Albert Leroy Ellery Mc- 
Intosh. I don’t believe that I 
heard yours, sir.” 

“Bracken. Blackjack Bracken. 
I was telling Billy here that if 
he really had a blob that could 
talk, I might be able to use it in 
my night club. We could have 
you here at the Snake Ranch in 
the daytime for the tourists and 
kids. Then I could have you at 
the club at night. We could work 
out an act. Do you think you 
could learn to play the guitar?” 
“Probably. But it would be 
much easier for me merely to 
duplicate the sound.” 

“But then how could you sing 


84

and make guitar noise at the 
same time?” 

“You surely don’t think I am 
limited to one voice box?” 

“Oh. I didn’t know. What’s 
that big metal ball you have 
there?” 

“That’s my communication 
sphere, to record my thoughts. I 
would not be without it. When 
in danger, I swallow it. When 
in extreme danger, I will have to 
escape to a spot where I have 
concealed my ejection mortar, 
and send my sphere into the gal- 
actic drift on a chance that it 
may be found.” 

“That’s no kind of gag to put 
in an act. What I have in mind 
is something like this.” 

Blackjack Bracken told a joke. 
It was a childish one and in 
poor taste. 

“I don’t believe that is quite 
my style,” I said. 

“All right, what would you 
suggest?” 

“I thought that I might lecture 
your patrons on the Higher Eth- 
ic.” 

“Look, George Albert, my pa- 
trons don’t even have the lower 
ethic.” 

“And just what sort of recom- 
pense are we talking about?” I 
asked. 

“Billy and I had about settled 
on a hundred and fifty a week.” 

“A hundred and fifty for 
whom?” 


“Why, for Billy.” 

“Let us make it a hundred an<j 
fifty for myself, and ten per cent 
for Billy as my agent.” 

“Say, this blob’s real smart 
isn’t he, Billy?” 

“Too smart.” 

“Yes, sir, George Albert, you’re 
one smart blob. What kind of 
contract have you signed with 
Billy here?” 

“No contract.” 

“Just a gentlemen’s agree, 
ment?” 

“No agreement.” 

“Billy, you can’t hold him in a 
cage without a contract. That’s 
slavery. It’s against the law.” 
“But, Blackjack, a blob isn’t 
people.” 

“Try proving that in court. 
Will you sign a contract with me, 
George Albert?” 

“I will not dump Billy. He be- 
friended me and gave me a home 
with the turtles and snakes. I 
will sign a joint contract with the 
two of you. We will discuss 
terms tomorrow — after I have 
estimated the attendance both 
here and at the night club.” 

Ill 

the walking grubs (who 
call themselves “people”) 
there are two kinds, and they 
place great emphasis on the dif- 
ference. From this stems a large 
part of their difficulties. This dis- 


tinction, which is one of polarity, 
^ts quite across the years and 
ability and station of life. It is 
n0 t confined only to the people 
grubs, but also involves appar- 
ently all the beings on the planet 

Florida. 

It appears that a person is 
committed to one or the other 
polarity at the beginning of life, 
maintaining that polarity until 
death. The interlocking attrac- 
tion-repulsion complex set up by 
these two opposable types has 
deep emotional involvements. It 
is the cause of considerable con- 
cern and disturbance, as well as 
desire and inspiration. There is 
a sort of poetic penumbra about 
the whole thing that tends to dis- 
guise its basic simplicity, expres- 
sible as a simultaneous polarity 
equation. 

Complete segregation of the 
two types seems impossible. If 
it has ever been tried, it has now 
evidently been abandoned as im- 
practical. 

There is indeed an intangible 
difference between the two types, 
so that before that first day at 
the Reptile Ranch was finished, 
I was able to differentiate be- 
tween the two more than ninety 
per cent of the time. The knowl- 
edge of this difference in polarity 
seems to be intuitive. 

These two I will call the Beta 
and Gamma, or Boy and Girl, 
types. I began to see that this 


opposability of the two types was 
one of the great driving forces of 
the people. 

In the evening I was trans- 
ported to the night club and I 
was a success. I would not enter- 
tain them with blue jokes or blue 
lyrics, but the patrons seemed 
fascinated by my simple imita- 
tions of all the instruments of the 
orchestra and my singing of 
comic ballads that Eustace had 
taught me in odd moments that 
day. They were also interested 
in the way that I drank gin — that 
is, emptying the bottle without 
breaking the seal. (It seems that 
the grub-people are unable to ab- 
sorb a liquid without making 
direct contact with it.) 

And I met Margaret, one of 
the “girl” singers. 

I had been wondering to which 
type of people I might show af- 
finity. Now I knew. I was defi- 
nitely a Beta type, for I was 
attracted to Margaret, who was 
unmistakably a Gamma. I began 
to understand the queer effect 
that these types have on each 
other. 

She came over to my cage. 

“I want to rub your head for 
good luck before I go on,” she 
said. 

“Thank you, Margaret,” I re- 
plied, “but that is not my head.” 

She sang with incomparable 
sadness, with all the sorrow and 
sordidness that appear to be the 


86

THE WEIRDEST WORLD

lot of unfortunate Gammas. It 
was the essence of melancholy 
made into music. It was a little 
bit like the ghost music on the 
asteroid Artemis, a little like the 
death chants on Dolmena. Sex 
and sorrow. Nostalgia. Regret. 

Her singing shook me with a 
yearning that had no precedent. 

She came back to my cage. 

“You were wonderful, Marga- 
ret,” I said. 

“I’m always wonderful when 
I’m singing for my supper. I am 
less wonderful in the rare times 
that I am well fed. But are you 
happy, little buddy?” 

“I had become almost so, till 
I heard you sing. Now I am over- 
come with sorrow and longing. 
Margaret, I am fascinated with 
you.” 

“I go for you too, blob. You’re 
my buddy. Isn’t it funny that the 
only buddy I have in the world 
is a blob? But if you’d seen some 
of the guys- I’ve been married to 
— boy! I wouldn’t insult you by 
calling them blobs. Have to go 
now. See you tomorrow night — 
if they keep us both on.” 

lyrOW there was a problem to 

' face. It was necessary that I 
establish control over my en- 
vironment, and at once. How else 
could I aspire to Margaret? 

I knew that the heart of the 
entire place here was neither the 
bar nor the entertainment there- 


in, nor the cuisine, nor the danc- 
ing. The heart of the enterprise, 
was the Casino. Here was the 
money that mattered; the rest 
was but garnish. 

I had them bring me into the 
gambling rooms. 

I had expected problems 0 f 
complexity here with which the 
patrons worked for their gain or 
loss. Instead there was an almost 
amazing simplicity. All the games 
were based on first aspect num- 
bers only. Indeed, everything on 
the Planet Florida seemed based 
on first aspect numbers. 

Now it is an elemental fact 
that first aspect numbers do not 
carry within them their own pre- 
diction. Nor were the people 
even possessed of the prediction 
key that lies over the very thresh- 
old of the second aspect series. 

These people were actually . 
wagering sums — the symbols of 
prosperity — blindly, not knowing 
for sure whether they would win 
or lose. They were selecting 
numbers by hunch or at random 
with no assurance of profit. They 
were choosing a hole for a ball 
to fall into without knowing 
whether that was the right hole! 

I do not believe that I was 
ever so amazed at anything in 
my life. 

But here was my opportunity 
to establish control over my en- 
vironment. 

I began to play the games. 


Usually I would watch a round 
first, to be sure that I understood 
just what was going on. Then I 
would play a few times ... as 
„j a ny as it took to break the 
game. 

I broke game after game. 
When he could no longer pay 
m e, Blackjack closed the Casino 
in exasperation. 

Then we played poker, he and 
I and several others. This was 
even more simple. I suddenly 
realized that the grub-people 
could see only one side of the 
cards at a time. 

I played and I won. 

I owned the Casino now, and 
all of those people were now 
working for me. Billy Wilkins 
also played with us, so that in 
short order I also owned the 
Reptile Ranch. 

Before the evening was over, 
I owned a race track, a beach 
hotel, and a theater in a place 
named New York. 

I had begun to establish con- 
trol over my environment . 

L ATER. Now started the golden 
days. I increased my con- 
trol and did what I could for my 
friends. 

I got a good doctor for my old 
friend and roommate, Pete the 
python, and he began receiving 
treatment for his indigestion. I 
got a jazzy sports car for my 
friend Eustace imported from 


somewhere called Italy. And I 
buried Margaret in mink, for she 
had a fix on the fur of that mys- 
terious animal. She enjoyed 
draping it about her in the form 
of coats, capes, cloaks, mantles 
and stoles, though the weather 
didn’t really require it. 

I had now won several banks, 
a railroad, an airline, and a ca- 
sino in somewhere named Ha- 
vana. 

“You’re somebody now,” said 
Margaret. “You really ought to 
dress better. Or are you dressed? 
I never know. I don’t know if 
part of that is clothes or if all 
of it is you. But at least I’ve 
learned which is your head. I 
think we should be married in 
May. It’s so common to be mar- 
ried in June. Just imagine me 
being Mrs. George Albert Leroy 
Ellery McIntosh! You know, we 
have become quite an item. And 
do you know there are three bi- 
ographies of you out — Burgeon- 
ing Blob, The Blob from Way 
Out, The Hidden Hand Behind 
the Blob — What Does it Portend? 
And the governor has invited us 
to dine tomorrow. I do wish you 
would learn to eat. If you weren’t 
so nice, you’d be creepy. I al- 
ways say there’s nothing wrong 
with marrying a man, or a blob, 
with money. It shows foresight 
on the part of a girl. You know 
you will have to get a blood test? 
You had better get it tomorrow. 


88

You do have blood, don’t you?” 
I did, but not, of course, of the 
color and viscosity of hers. But 
I could give it that color and 
viscosity temporarily. And it 
would react negative in all the 
tests. 

She mused, “They are all jeal- 
ous of me. They say they 
wouldn’t marry a blob. They 
mean they couldn’t . Do you 
have to carry that tin ball with 
you all the time?” 

“Yes. It is my communication 
sphere. In it I record my thoughts. 
I would be lost without it.” 

“Oh, like a diary. How quaint!” 
Yes, those were the golden 
days. The grubs appeared to me 
in a new light, for was not Mar- 
garet also a grub? Yet she 
seemed not so unfinished as the 
rest. Though lacking a natural 
outer casing, she had not the ap- 
pearance of crawling out from 
under a rock. She was quite an 
attractive “girl.” And she cared 
for me. 

What more could I wish? I 
was affluent. I was respected. I 
was in control of my environ- 
ment. And I could aid my 
friends, of whom I had now ac- 
quired an astonishing number. 

Moreover, my old space-inep- 
titude sickness had left me. I 
never felt better in my life. Ah, 
golden days, one after the other 
like a pleasant dream. And soon 
I am to be married! 


r T , HERE has been a sudden] 
change. As on the Planet] 
Hecube, where full summer turns] 
into the dead of the winter in 
minutes, to the destruction of 
many travelers, so was it here, 1 
My world is threatened! 

It is tottering, all that I have 
built up. I will fight. I will have 
the best lawyers on the planet] 
I am not done. But I am threat-] 
ened. 

Later. This may be the end. 3 
The appeal court has given its 
decision. A blob may not own 1 
property in Florida. A blob is 
not a person. 

Of course I am not a person. 

I never pretended to be. But I 
am a personage! I will yet fight 1 
this thing. 

Later. I have lost everything.] 
The last appeal is gone. By defi-1 
nition, I am an animal of inde- 
terminate origin, and my prop- ] 
erty is being completely stripped 
from me. 

I made an eloquent appeal 
and it moved them greatly. 1 
There were tears in their eyes. 
But there was greed in the set 
of their mouths. They have a ! 
vested interest in stripping me. ; 
Each will seize a little. 

And I am left a pauper, a vas- j 
sal, an animal, a slave. This is 
always the last doom of the ] 
marooned, to be a despised alien 


90 


GALAXY 




at the mercy of a strange world. 

Yet it should not be hopeless. 
I will have Margaret. Since my 
contract with Billy Wilkins and 
Blackjack Bracken, long since 
bought up, is no longer in effect, 
Margaret should be able to han- 
dle my affairs as a person. I be- 
lieve that I have great earning 
powers yet, and I can win as 
much as I wish by gambling. We 
will treat this as only a techni- 
cality. We shall acquire new for- 
tune. I will reestablish control 
over my environment. I will 
bring back the golden days. A 
few of my old friends are still 
loyal to me, Margaret, Pete the 
python, Eustace. 

Later. The world has caved in 
completely. Margaret has thrown 
me over. 

“I’m sorry, blobby,” she said,' 
“but it just won’t work. You’re 
still nice, but without money you 
are only a blob. How could I 
marry a blob?” 

“But we can earn more mon- 
ey! I am talented.” 

“No, you’re box-office poison 
now. You were a fad, and fads 
die quickly.” 

“But, Margaret, I can win as 
much as I wish by gambling.” 
“Not a chance, blobby. No- 
body will gamble with you any 
more. Y ou’re through, blob. I 
will miss you, though. There will 
be a new blue note in my ballads 
when I sing for my supper, after 


the mink coats are all gone. ’By 
now.” 

“Margaret, do not leave me! 
What of all our golden days to. 
gether?” 

But all she said was “ ’By now.” 
And she was gone forever. 1 

T AM desolate and my old 
space-ineptitude has returned, 
My recovery was an illusion. I 
am so ill with awkwardness that 
I can no longer fly. I must walk 
on the ground like one of the 
giant grubs. A curse on this 
planet Florida and all its sister 
orbs! What a miserable world 
this is! 

How could I have been 
tricked by a young Gamma type 
of the walking grub? Let her 
crawl back under her ancestral 
rocks with all the rest of her 
kind. No, no, I do not mean 
that. To me she will always re- 
main a dream, a broken dream. 

I am no longer welcome at the 
Casino. They kicked me down 
the front steps. 

I no longer have a home at 
the Reptile Ranch. 

“Mr. George Albert,” said Eu- 
stace, “I just can’t afford to be 
seen with you any more. I have 
my position to consider, with a 
sports car and all that.” 

And Pete the python was curt 
“Well, big shot, I guess you 
aren’t so big after all. And you 


V^hen you had that doctor cure 
me of my indigestion, you left 
0 e with nothing but my bad 
conscience. I wish I could get my 
indigestion back.” 

“A curse on this world,” I said. 
“World, world, water, water, 
glug, glug,” said the turtles in 
their tanks, my only friends. 

So I have gone back into the 
woods to die. I have located my 
ejection mortar, and when I 
know that death is finally on me, 
I will fire off my communication 
sphere and hope it will reach 


the galactic drift. Whoever finds 
it — friend — space traveler — you 
who were too impatient to re- 
main on your own world — be you 
warned of this one! Here ingrati- 
tude is the rule and cruelty the 
main sport. The unfinished grubs 
have come out from under their 
rocks and they walk this world 
upside down with their heads in 
the air. Their friendship is fleet- 
ing, their promises are like the 
wind. 

I am near my end.

The Vortex Blaster by E. E. 
Smith. Gnome Press. 

“DOC” SMITH ruled the SF 
roost for a decade and a half 
during the years surrounding the 
Troubled Thirties. Each maga- 
zine installment of his Skylark 
and Lensman stories was breath- 
lessly awaited by Space Opera 
addicts (and, in those days, who 
wasn’t one?) 

The Vortex Blaster, the latest 
of the Lensman sagas, is as tre- 
mendously broad in scope as its 
famous predecessors and, also 


like them, on occasions painfully 
coy. 

Synopsis: Atomic vortexes, rag- 
ing areas of destruction, are 
blighting the surfaces of numerous 
planets. Inherently unstable, they 
must be quenched by an exactly 
calculated blast at a precise 
instant of time. Computers have 
been unable to supply data fast 
enough to do the job. Ergo, the 
Vortex Blaster, a mental freak 
with a combination of Uni vac 
and Superman condensed into 
the brain of one man. It is he 
who discovers the vast plot

against civilization masked by 
t he immediate peril of the vor- 
texes. 

Plotwise composed of pure 
nostalgia, it is easy to see how 
the modern trend of SF has 
passed good Doc Smith by. But 
hang me for a Boskonian zwilnik 
an d also by the great god Klono 
if I didn’t get a huge bang out 
of his super-duper yarn.

Agent of Vega by James H. 
Schmitz. Gnome Press. 

“SUPER-SCIENCE FICTION in 
the grand manner,” , brags the 
blurb in what turns out to be 
almost an understatement. This 
lineal descendant of the Doc 
Smith sagas fittingly follows the 
old master’s latest and points up 
the “new look” of S. O. 

This is Space Opera composed 
by a Space-Wagner, for a uni- 
verse-wide stage and a chorus 
and orchestra of ET’s. Three 
novelettes from Astounding and 
one from Galaxy present a pic- 
ture of titanic conflict against 
ruthless enemies. Zone Agents — 
supermen and women of the Eliot 
Ness ilk — are forced to con- 
duct their campaigns against evil 
on a sub-rosa level due to the 
restrictions of interstellar agree- 
ment and laissez-faire. However, 
their mental, physical and me- 
chanical equipment are such that 


it hardly remains a fair fight. The 
space ships of the agents them- 
selves are telepathic and omnipo- 
tent. Even E. E. Smith never 
had it that good! 

What places Schmitz’s work 
above run of the mill S. O. is the 
quality as well as breadth of his 
imagination, but most of all his 
touch for characterization — 
which suffuses even his ET’s 
and super-mechanisms with the 
(sometimes incongruous) flush of 
humanity.

A Guide to the Stars by Patrick 
Moore. W. W. Norton & Co., Inc. 

IN CONTRAST to the views of a 
noted British professor of astrono-

larizations excite interest so that 
the non-scientific layman can fol- 
low up his thirst for knowledge 
with more authoritative informa- 
tion. Moore does well by his 
audience. 

Though his book contains “no 
new theories or world-shaking 
pronouncements,” he writes with 
skill sufficient to engross even a 
merely superficially interested 
reader.

fictional story of the adventure- 
some voyage of the first two men 
to reach the moon. It is a highly 
detailed and absorbing blow-by-

The secondary section of the 
book is a serious text explaining 
the technical points raised by the 
fiction, and is marginally placed 
on the identical pages so that 
reference can be immediate. 

The illustrations are excep-

abundance. Even the best

and astonishing material over 
which to dream. 

Conquest oi Lite by Adam Luk- 
ens. Avalon Books, N. Y. $2.95 

LUKENS SHOWED consider- 
able originality in his first Avalon 
novel, The Sea People. Unfor- 
tunately that opus had little else 
to recommend it. 

His present story concerns a 
future when Earthwomen, who 
outnumber males, are also mur- 
derously sadistic in their quest 
for entertainment. These delight- 
ful females purchase “reclaimed 
men”, factory-rebuilt human ro- 
bots fashioned from corpses, a la 
Frankenstein, as slave compan- 
ions. 

The story’s prime mover is a 
former colonist of a distant star, 


widowed on a primitive plan 
and unwilling inheritor of a re- 
claimed man. The yarn is con- 
cerned with her humanitarian 
attempt to eradicate the slave 
conditioning of the human robots, 

Lukens’s story is fast paced and 
cerebrally interesting but i$

bility to handle words.

Bigotry he finds in the treatment ' 
of the only alien ever to attempt

of certain top officials to retain a 
monopoly of medical knowledge

ARTHUR SEA CLARKE is 
back on the water wagon, in- 
terpreting the wet frontier in 
much the manner of his Explora-

We are at the bare threshold 
of each and both hold mysteries 
and promises beyond our imagi-

More than just dealing with 
the obvious — we are rapidly de- 
pleting our land-based resources 
and must turn more and more to 
the sea for food, minerals and 
power — Clarke presents, a ple-

spersed with conjecture.

MOTHER 
HITTON’S 
LITTUL ZITTONS 


This night she glanced for the 
j^o-hundredth time at the warn- 
j„g bank. The bank was quiet. No 
danger lights shone. Yet she felt 
a n enemy out somewhere in the 
un iverse — an enemy waiting to 
strike at her and her world, to 
snatch at the immeasurable 
wealth of the Norstrilians — and 
s he snorted with impatience. 
Come along, little man, she 
thought. Come along, little man, 
a nd die. Don’t keep me waiting. 

She smiled when she recognized 
the absurdity of her own thought. 
She waited for him. 

And he did not know it.

T HE moon spun. The woman 
watched. Twenty-one facets 
had been polished at the 
moon’s equator. Her function was 
to arm it. She was Mother Hitton, 
the Weapons Mistress of Old 
North Australia. 


Illustrated by FINLAY 

She was a ruddy-faced, cheer- 
ful blonde of indeterminate age. 
Her eyes were blue, her bosom 
heavy, her arms strong. She 
looked like a mother, but the 
only child she had ever had died 
many generations ago. Now she 
acted as mother to a planet, not 
to a person; the Norstrilians slept 
well because they knew she was 
watching. The weapons slept their 
long, sick sleep. 

GALAXY 


H E, the robber, was relaxed 
enough. He was Benjacomin 
Bozart, and was highly trained in 
the arts of relaxation. 

No one at Sunvale, here on 
Ttiolle, could suspect that he was 
a Senior Warden of the Guild of 
Thieves, reared under the light of 
the starry-violet star. No one 
could smell the odor of Viola 
Siderea upon him. “Viola Side- 
rea,” the Lady Ru had said, “was 
once the most beautiful of worlds 
and it is now the most rotten. Its 
people were once models for 
mankind, and now they are 
thieves, liars and killers. You can 
smell their souls in the open day.” 
The Lady Ru had died a long 
time ago. She was much respected, 
but she was wrong. The robber 
did not smell to others at all. He 


knew it. He was no more “wrong” 
than a shark approaching a 
school of cod. Life’s nature is to’ 
live, and he had been nurtured to 
live as he had to live — by seek- 
ing prey. 

How else could he live? Viol^ 
Siderea had gone bankrupt a long 
time ago, when the photonic sails 
had disappeared from sjjace and 
the pianoforming ships began to 
whisper their way between the 
stars. His ancestors had been left 
to die on an off-trail planet. They 
refused to die. Their ecology 
shifted and they became pre- 

dators upon man, adapted by 
time and genetics to their deadly 
tasks. And he, the robber, was 
champion of all his people — the 
best of their best. 

He was Benjacomin Bozart. 

He had sworn to rob Old North 
Australia or to die in the attempt, 
and he had no intention of dying. 

The beach at Sunvale was 

warm and lovely. Ttiolle was a 
free and casual transit planet. His 
weapons were luck and himself: 
he planned to play both well. 

The Norstrilians could kill. 

So could he. 

At this moment, in this place, 
he was a happy tourist at a 
lovely beach. Elsewhere, else- 

when, he could become a ferret 
among conies, a hawk among 

doves. 

Benjacomin Bozart, Thief and 
Warden. He did not know that

someonq was waiting for him. 
Someone who did not know his 
name was prepared to waken 
death, just for him. He was still 
serene. 

Mother Hitton was not serene. 
She sensed him dimly but could 
not yet spot him. 

One of her weapons snored. 
She turned it over. 

A thousand stars away, Benja- 
comin Bozart smiled as he walked 
toward the beach. 

II 

DENJACOMIN felt like a tour- 
ist. His tanned face was 
tranquil. His proud, hooded eyes 
were calm. His handsome mouth, 
even without its charming smile, 
kept a suggestion of pleasantness 
at its corners. He looked attrac- 
tive without seeming odd in the 
least. He looked much younger 
than he actually was. He walked 
with springy, happy steps along 
the beach of Sunvale. 

The waves rolled in, white- 
crested, like the breakers of 
Mother Earth. The Sunvale 
people were proud of the way 
their world resembled Manhome 
itself. Few of them had even seen 
Manhome, but they had all heard 
a bit of history and most of them 
had a passing anxiety when they 
thought of the ancient govern- 
ment still wielding political power 
across the depth of space. They 


did not like the old Instrument 
tality of Earth, but they respected 
and feared it. The waves might 
remind them of the pretty side 
of Earth; they did not want to 
remember the not-so-pretty side. 

This man was like the pretty 
side of old Earth. They could 
not sense the power within him. 
The Sunvale people smiled ab- 
sently at him as he walked past 
them along the shoreline. 

The atmosphere was quiet and 
everything around him serene. 
He turned his face to the sun. He 
closed his eyes. He let the warm 
sunlight beat through his eyelids, 
illuminating him with its comfort 
and its reassuring touch. 

Benjacomin dreamed of the 
greatest theft that any man had 
ever planned. He dreamed of 
stealing a huge load of the wealth 
from the richest world that man- 
kind had ever built. H6 thought 
of what would happen when he 
would finally bring riches back to 
the planet of Viola Siderea where 
he had been reared. Benjacomin 
turned his face away from the sun 
and languidly looked over the 
other people on the beach. 

There were no Norstrilians in 
sight yet. They were easy enough 
to recognize. Big people with red 
complexions; superb athletes and 
yet, in their own way, innocent, 
young and very tough. He had 
trained for this theft for two hun- 
dred years, his life prolonged for 


the purpose by the Guild of 
Thieves on Viola Siderea. He 
himself embodied the dreams of 
j,; s own planet, a poor planet 
once a crossroads of commerce, 
n0 W sunken to being a minor out- 
post for spoliation and pilferage. 

He saw a Norstrilian woman 
come out from the hotel and go 
down to the beach. He waited, 
an d he looked, and he dreamed. 
He had a question to ask and no 
adult Australian would answer it. 

“Funny,” thought he, “that I 
call them ‘Australians’ even now. 
That’s the old, old Earth name 
for them — rich, brave, tough 
people. Fighting children stand- 
ing on half the world . and 
now they are the tyrants of all 
mankind. They hold the wealth. 
They have the santaclara, and 
other people live or die depend- 
ing upon the commerce they have 
with the Norstrilians. But I won’t. 
And my people won’t. We’re men 
who are wolves to Man.” 

B ENJACOMIN waited grace- 
fully. Tanned by the light of 
many suns, he looked forty though 
he was two hundred. He dressed 
casually, by the standards of a 
vacationer. He might have been 
an intercultural salesman, a senior 
gambler, an assistant starport 
manager. He might even have 
been a detective working along 
the commerce lanes. He wasn’t. 
He was a thief. And he was so 


good a thief that people turned to 
him and put their property in 
his hands because he was reassur- 
ing, calm, gray-eyed, blondhaired. 
Benjacomin waited. The woman 
glanced at him, a quick glance 
full of open suspicion. 

What she saw must have 
calmed her. She went on past. 
She called back over the dune, 
“Come on, Johnny, we can swim 
out here.” A little boy, who looked 
eight or ten years old, came over 
the dune top, running toward his 
mother. 

Benjacomin tensed like a 
cobra. His eyes became sharp, his 
eyelids narrowed. 

This was the prey. Not too 
young, not too old. If the victim 
had been too young he wouldn’t 
know the answer; if the victim 
were too old it was no use taking 
him on. Norstrilians were famed 
in combat; adults were mentally 
and physically too strong to war- 
rant attack. 

Benjacomin knew that every 
thief who had approached the 
planet of the Norstrilians — who 
had tried to raid the dream world 
of Old North Australia — had 
gotten out of contact with his 
people and had died. There was 
no word of any of them. 

And yet he knew that hun- 
dreds of thousands of Norstrilians 
must know the secret. They now 
and then made jokes about it. He 
had heard these jokes when he

MOTHER HITTON'S LITTUL KITTONS 


101 


was a young man, and now he was 
more than an old man without 
once coming near the answer. Life 
was expensive. He was well into 
his third lifetime and the lifetimes 
had been purchased honestly by 
his people. Good thieves all of 
them, paying out hard-stolen 
money to obtain the medicine to 
let their greatest thief remain 
living. Benjacomin didn’t like 
violence. But when violence pre- 
pared tlje way to the greatest 
theft of all time, he was willing 
to use it. 

The woman looked at him 
again. The mask of evil which 
had flashed across his face faded 
into benignity; he calmed. She 
caught him in that moment of 
relaxation. She liked him. 

She smiled and, with that 
awkward hesitation so character- 
istic of the Norstrilians, she said, 
“Could you mind my boy a bit 
while I go in the water? I think 
we’ve seen each other here at the 
hotel.” 

“I don’t mind,” said he. “I’d be 
glad to. Come here, son.” 

Johnny walked across the sun- 
light dunes to his own death. He 
came within reach of his mother’s 
enemy. 

But the mother had already 
turned. 

fT^HE trained hand of Benja- 
comin Bozart reached out. He 
seized the child by the shoulder. 


He turned the boy toward him, 
forcing him down. Before the 
child could cry out, Benjamin 
had the needle into him with the 
truth drug. 

All Johnny reacted to was pain, 
and then a hammerblow inside 
his own skull as the powerful drug 
took force. 

Benjacomin looked out over 
the water. The mother was swim- 
ming. She seemed to be looking 
back at them. She was obviously 
unworried. To her, the child 
seemed to be looking at some- 
thing the stranger was showing 
him in a relaxed, easy way. 

“Now, sonny,” said Benja- 
comin, “tell me, what’s the out- 
side defense?” 

\ 

The boy didn’t answer. 

“What is the outer defense, 
sonny? What is the outer de- 
fense?” repeated Benjacomin. 
The boy still didn’t answer. 

Something close to horror ran 
over the skin of Benjacomin 
Bozart as he realized that he had 
gambled his safety on this planet, 
gambled the plans themselves for 
a chance to break the secret of 
the Norstrilians. 

He had been stopped by 
simple, easy devices. The child 
had already been conditioned 
against attack. Any attempt to 
force knowledge out of the child 
brought on a conditioned reflex 
of total muteness. The boy was 
literally unable to talk. 


102 


GALAXY 


Sunlight gleaming on her wet 
hair, the mother turned around 
an d called back, “Are you all 
right, Johnny?” 

Benjacomin waved to her 
instead. “I’m showing him my 
pictures, ma’am. He likes ’em. 
Take your time.” The mother 
hesitated and then turned back 
to the water and swam slowly 
away. 

Johnny, taken by the drug, sat 
lightly, like an invalid, on Benja- 

comin’s lap. 

Benjacomin said, “Johnny, 
you’re going to die now and you 
will hurt terribly if you don’t tell 
m e what I want to know.” The 
boy struggled weakly against his 
grasp. Benjacomin repeated, “I’m 
going to hurt you if you don’t 
tell me what I want to know. 
What are the outer defenses? 
What are the outer defenses?” 

The child struggled and Benja- 
comin realized that the boy was 
putting up a fight to comply with 
the orders, not a fight to get away. 
He let the child slip through his 
hands and the boy put out a 
finger and began writing on the 
wet sand. The letters stood out. 

A man’s shadow loomed behind 
them. 

Benjacomin, alert, ready to 
spin, kill or run, slipped to the 
ground beside the child and said, 
“That’s a jolly puzzle. That is a 
good one. Show me some more.” 
He smiled up at the passing adult. 


The man was a stranger. The 
stranger gave him a very curious 
glance which became casual when 
he saw the pleasant face of 
Benjacomin, so tenderly and so 
agreeably playing with the child. 

The fingers were still making 
the letters in the sand. 

There stood the riddle in let- 
ters: MOTHER HITTON’S LIT- 
TUL KITTONS. 

T HE woman was coming back 
from the sea, the mother with 
questions. Benjacomin stroked 
the sleeve of his coat and brought 
out his second needle, a shallow 
poison which it would take days 
or weeks of laboratory work to 
detect. He thrust it directly into 
the boy’s brain, slipping the 
needle up behind the skin at the 
edge of the hairline. The hair 
shadowed the tiny prick. The 
incredibly hard needle slipped 
under the edge of the skull. The 
child was dead. 

Murder accomplished, Benja- 
comin casually erased the secret 
from the sand. The woman came 
nearer. He called to her, his voice 
full of pleasant concern, “Ma’am, 
you’d better come here, I think 
your son has fainted from the 
heat.” 

He gave the mother the body 
of her son. Her face changed to 
alarm. She looked frightened and 
alert. She didn’t know how to 
meet this. 


MOTHER HITTON'S LITTUL KITTONS 


103 


For a dreadful moment she 
looked into his eyes. 

Two hundred years of training 
took effect . She saw nothing. 
The murderer did not shine with 
murder. The hawk was hidden 
beneath the dove. The heart was 
masked by the trained face. 

Benjacomin relaxed in profes- 
sional assurance. He had been 
prepared to kill her too, although 
he was not sure that he could 
kill an adult, female Norstrilian. 
Very helpfully said he, “You stay 
here with him. I’ll run to the hotel 
and get help. I’ll hurry.” 

He turned and ran. A beach 
attendant saw him and ran to- 
ward him. “The child’s sick,” he 
shouted. He came to the mother 
in time to see blunt, puzzled 
tragedy on her face and with it, 
something more than tragedy: 
doubt. 

“He’s not sick,” said she. “He’s 
dead.” 

“He can’t be.” Benjacomin 
looked attentive. He felt atten- 
tive. He forced the sympathy to 
pour out of his posture, out of all 
the little muscles of his face. “He 
can’t be. I was talking to him 
just a minute ago. We were doing 
little puzzles in the sand.” 

The mother spoke with a hol- 
low, broken voice that sounded as 
though it would never find the 
right chords for human speech 
again, but would go on forever 
with the ill-attuned flats of un- 


expected grief. “He’s dead,” sh e 
said. “You saw him die and j 
guess I saw him die, too. I can’t 
tell what’s happened. The child 
was full of santaclara. He had a 
thousand years to live but no^ 
he’s dead. What’s your name?” * 
Benjacomin said, “Eldon. 
Eldon the salesman, ma’am. I liv e 
here lots of times.” 


UTy/rOTHER Hitton’s littul kit- 
tons. Mother Hitton’s littul • 
kittons.” 

The silly phrase ran in his 
mind. Who was Mother Hitton? 
What was she the mother of? 
What were kittons? Were they a 
misspelling for “kittens?” Little 
cats? Or were they something 
else? 

Had he killed a fool to get a 
fool’s answer? 

How many more days did he 
have to stay there with the doubt- 
ful, staggered woman? How 
many days did he have to watch 
and wait? He wanted to get back 
to Viola Siderea; to take the 
secret, bad as it was, for his 
people to study. Who was Mother 
Hitton? 

He forced himself out of his 
room and went downstairs. 

The pleasant monotony of a 
big hotel was such that the other 
guests looked interestedly at him. 
He was the man who had watched 


#hile the child died on the beach. 

Some lobby-living scandal- 
mongers that stayed there had 
made up fantastic stories that he 
j, a d killed the child. Others 
attacked the stories, saying they 
knew perfectly well who Eldon 
w as. He was Eldon the salesman. 
It was ridiculous. 

People hadn’t changed much, 
even though the ships with the 
Go-Captains sitting at their hearts 
whispered between the stars, even 
though people shuffled between 
worlds — when they had the 
money to pay their passage back 
and forth — like leaves falling in 
soft, playful winds. Benjacomin 
faced a tragic dilemma. He knew 
very well that any attempt to 
decode the answer would run 
directly into the protective de- 
vices set up by the Norstrilians. 

Old North Australia was im- 
mensely wealthy. It was known 
the length and breadth of all the 
stars that they had hired merce- 
naries, defensive spies, hidden 
agents and alerting devices. 

Even Manhome — Mother 
Earth herself, whom no money 
could buy — was bribed by the 
drug of life. An ounce of the 
santaclara drug, reduced, crystal- 
lized and called “stroon,” could 
give forty to sixty years of life. 
Stroon entered the rest of the 
Earth by ounces and pounds, but 
it was refined back on Old North 
Australia by the ton. With treas- 


ure like this, the Norstrilians 
owned an unimaginable world 
whose resources overreached all 
conceivable limits of money. They 
could buy anything. They could 
pay with other peoples’ lives. 

For hundreds of years they had 
given secret funds to buying for- 
eigners’ services to safeguard their 
own security. 

Benjacomin stood there in the 
lobby: “Mother Hitton’s littul kit- 
tons.” 

He had all the wisdom and 
wealth of a thousand worlds stuck 
in his mind but he didn’t dare ask 
anywhere as to what it meant. 

Suddenly he brightened. 

TTE looked like a man who had 
-*■ -^-thought of a good game to 
play, a pleasant diversion to be 
welcomed, a companion to be re- 
membered, a new food to be 
tasted. He had had a very happy 
thought. 

There was one source that 
wouldn’t talk. The library. He 
could at least check the obvious, 
simple things, and find out what 
there was already in the realm 
of public knowledge concerning 
the secret he had taken from the 
dying boy. 

His own safety had not been 
wasted, Johnny’s life had not 
been thrown away, if he could 
find any one of the four words as 
a key. Mother or Hitton or Littul, 
in its special meaning, or Kitton.

He might yet break through to 
the loot of Norstrilia. 

He swung jubilantly, turning 
on the ball of his right foot. He 
moved lightly and pleasantly to- 
ward the billiard room, beyond 
which lay the library. He went in. 

This was a very expensive hotel 
and very old-fashioned. It even 
had books made out of paper, 
with genuine bindings. Benja- 
comin crossed the room. He saw 
that they had the Galactic Ency- 
clopedia in two hundred volumes. 
He took down the volume headed 
“Hi-Hi.” He opened it from the 
rear, looking for the name “Hit- 
ton” and there it was. “Hitton, 
Benjamin — pioneer of old North 
Australia. Said to be originator of 
part of the defense system. Lived 
A.D. 10719-17213.” That was all. 
Benjacomin moved among the 
books. The word “kittons” in 
that peculiar spelling did not 
occur anywhere, neither in the 
encyclopedia nor in any other list 
maintained by the library. He 
walked out and upstairs, back to 
his room. 

“Littul” had not appeared at 
all. It was probably the boy’s own 
childish mistake. 

He took a chance. The mother, 
half blind with bewilderment and 
worry, sat in a stiff-backed chair 
on the edge of the porch. The 
other women talked to her. They 
knew her husband was coming. 
Benjacomin went up to her and 

106 


tried to pay his respects. Sh e 
didn’t see him. 

“I’m leaving now, ma’am. I’n, 
going on to the next planet, but 
I’ll be back in two or three sub. 
jective weeks. And if you need 
me for urgent questions, I’ll leave 
my addresses with the poli Ce 
here.” 

ENJACOMIN left the weep, 
ing mother. 

Benjacomin left the quiet hotel. 
He obtained a priority passage. 

The easy-going Sunvale Police 
made no resistance to his demand 
for a sudden departure visa. After 
all, he had an identity, he had 
his own funds, and it was not the 
custom of Sunvale to contradict 
its guests. Benjacomin went on 
the ship and as he moved toward 
the cabin in which he could rest 
for a few hours, a man stepped 
up beside him. A youngish man, 
hair parted in the middle, short of 
stature, gray of eyes. 

This man was the local agent 
of the Norstrilian secret police. 

Benjacomin, trained thief that 
he was, did not recognize the 
policeman. It never occurred to 
him that the library itself had 
been attuned and that the word 
“kittons” in the peculiar Norstri- 
lian spelling was itself an alert. 
Looking for that spelling had set 
off a minor alarm. He had touched 
the trip-wire. 

The stranger nodded. Benja- 
G ALAXY 


comin nodded back. “I’m a travel- 
ing man, waiting over between as- 
signments. I haven’t been doing 
very well. How are you making 
out?” 

“Doesn’t matter to me. I don’t 
earn money; I’m a technician. 
Liverant is the name.” 

Benjacomin sized him up. The 
man was a technician all right. 
They shook hands perfunctorily. 
Liverant said, “I’ll join you in the 
bar a little later. I think I’ll rest 
a bit first.” 

They both lay down then and 
said very little while the momen- 
tary flash of planoform went 
through the ship. The flash 
passed. From books and lessons 
they knew that the ship was leap- 
ing forward in two dimensions 
while, somehow or other, the fury 
of space itself was fed into the 
computers — and that these in 
turn were managed by the Go- 
Captain who controlled the ship. 

They knew these things but 
they could not feel them. All they 
felt was the sting of a slight pain. 

The sedative was in the air it- 
self, sprayed in the ventilating 
system. They both expected to 
become a little drunk.

resistance, implanted in his un-

training. Bozart was not trained 
against deception by a technician; 
it never occurred to the Thieves’ 
Guild back on Viola Siderea that 
it would be necessary for their 
own people to resist deceivers. 
Liverant had already been in 
touch with Norstrilia — Norstrilia 
whose money reached across the 
stars, Norstrilia who had alerted 
a hundred thousand worlds 
against the mere thought of tres- 
pass. 

Liverant began to chatter. “I 
wish I could go further than this 
trip. I wish that I could go to 
Olympia. You can buy anything 
in Olympia.” 

“I’ve heard of it,” said Bozart. 
“It’s sort of a funny trading planet 
with not much chance for busi- 
nessmen, is it?” 

Liverant laughed and his laugh- 
ter was merry and genuine. 
“Trading? They don’t trade. They 
swap. They take all the stolen 
loot of a thousand worlds and sell 
it over again and they change and 
they paint it and they mark it. 
That’s their business there. The 
people are blind. It’s a strange 
world, and all you have to do is 
to go in there and you can have 
anything you want. Man,” said 
Liverant, “what I could do in a 
year in that place! Everybody is 
blind except me and a couple of 
tourists. And there’s all the wealth 

KITTONS 107 


that everybody thought he’s 
mislaid, half the wrecked ships, 
the forgotten colonies (they’ve 
all been cleaned out), and bang! 
it all goes to Olympia.” 

Olympia wasn’t really that 
good and Liverant didn’t know 
why it was his business to guide 
the killer there. All he knew was 
that he had a duty and the duty 
was to direct the trespasser. 

Many years before either man 
was born the code word had been 
planted in directories, in books, 
in packing cases and invoices. 
Kittons misspelled. This was the 
cover name for the outer moon of 
Norstrilian defense. The use of 
the cover name brought a raging 
alert ready into action, with sys- 
temic nerves as hot and quick as 
incandescent tungsten wire. 

By the time that they were 
ready to go to the bar and have 
refreshments, Benjacomin had 
half forgotten that it was his 
new acquaintance who had sug- 
gested Olympia rather than 
another place. He had to go to 
Viola Siderea to get the credits 
to make the flight to take the 
wealth, to win the world of Olym- 
pia. 

IV 

AT home on his native planet 
■^Bozart was a subject of a 
gentle but very sincere celebra- 
tion. 


The Elders of the Guild of 
Thieves welcomed him. They 
congratulated him. “Who else 
could have done what you’ve 
done, boy? You’ve made the 
opening move in a brand new 
game of chess. There has never 
been a gambit like this before. 
We have a name; we have an 
animal. We’ll try it right here!” 
The Thieves’ Council turned to 
their own encyclopedia. They 
turned through the name “Hit- 
ton” and then found the reference 
“kitton.” None of them knew that 
a false lead had been planted 
there — -by an agent in their world. 

The agent, in his turn, had 
been seduced years before, de- 
bauched in the middle of his 
career, forced into temporary 
honesty, blackmailed and sent 
home. In all the years that he 
had waited for a dreaded coun- 
tersign — a countersign which he 
himself never knew to be an ex- 
tension of Norstrilian intelligence 
— he never dreamed that he could 
pay his debt to the outside world 
so simply. All they had done was 
to send him one page to add to 
the encyclopedia. He added it 
and then went home, weak with 
exhaustion. The years of fear and 
waiting were almost too much for 
the thief. He drank heavily for 
fear that he might otherwise kill 
himself. Meanwhile, the pages re- 
mained in order, including the 
new one, slightly altered for his 


I colleagues. The encyclopedia in- 
dicated the change like any nor- 
mal revision, though the whole 
entry was new and falsified: 

Beneath this passage one 
revision ready. Dated 24th 
year of second issue. 

The reported “Kittons” of 
Norstrilia are nothing more 
than the use of organic 
means to induce the disease 
in Earth-mutated sheep 
which produces a virus in its 
turn, as refinable as the san- 
taclara drug. The term “Kit- 
tons” enjoyed a temporary 
vogue as a reference term 
both to the disease and to 
the destructability of the di- 
sease in the event of external 
attack. This is believed to 
have been connected with 
the career of Benjamin Hit- 
ton, one of the original 
pioneers of Norstrilia. 

The Council of Thieves read 
it and the Chairman of the council 
said “I’ve got your papers ready. 
You can go try them now. Where 
do you want to go? Through Neu- 
hamburg?” 

“No,” said Benjacomin. “I 
thought I’d try Olympia.” 

“Olympia’s all right,” said the 
chairman. “Go easy. There’s only 
one chance in a thousand you’ll 
fail. But if you do, we might have 
to pay for it.” 


He smiled wryly and handed 
Benjacomin a blank mortgage 
against all the labor and all the 
property of Viola Siderea. 

The Chairman laughed with a 
sort of snort. “It’d be pretty rough 
on us if you had to borrow 
enough on the trading planet to 
force us to become honest — and 
then lost out anyhow.” 

“No fear,” said Benjacomin. “I 
can cover that.” 

•THHERE are some worlds where 
all dreams die, but square- 
clouded Olympia is not one of 
them. The eyes of men and 
women are bright on Olympia, for 
they see nothing. 

“Brightness was the color of 
pain,” said Nachtigall, “when we 
could see. If thine eye offend thee, 
pluck thyself out, for the fault 
lies not in the eye but in the 
soul.” 

Such talk was common in 
Olympia, where the settlers went 
blind a long time ago and now 
think themselves superior to 
sighted people. Radar wires tickle 
their living brains; they can per- 
ceive radiation as well as can an 
animal-type man with little 
aquariums hung in the middle of 
his face. Their pictures are sharp, 
and they demand sharpness. 
Their buildings soar at impos- 
sible angles. Their blind children 
sing songs as the .tailored climate 
proceeds according to the num- 


108 


GALAXY 


MOTHER HITTON'S LITTUL KITTONS

bers, geometrical as a kaleido- 
scope. 

There went the man, Bozart 
himself. Among the blind his 
dreams soared, and he paid 
money for information which no 
living person had ever seen. 

Sharp-clouded and aqua-skied, 
Olympia swam past him like 
another man’s dream. He did not 
mean to tarry there, because he 
had a rendezvous with death in 
the sticky, sparky space around 
Norstrilia. 

/‘'kNCE in Olympia, Benjacomin 
went about his arrangements 
for the attack on Old North Aus- 
tralia. On his second day on the 
planet he had been very lucky. 
He met a man named Lavender 
and he was sure he had heard the 
name before. Not a member of his 
own Guild of Thieves, but a dar- 
ing rascal with a bad reputation 
among the stars. 

It was no wonder that he had 
found Lavender. His pillow had 
told him Lavender’s story fifteen 
times during his sleep in the past 
week. And, whenever he dreamed, 
he dreamed dreams which had 
been planted in his mind by the 
Norstrilian counterintelligence. 
They had beaten him in getting 
to Olympia first and they were 
prepared to let him have only 
that which he deserved. The 
Norstrilian Police were not cruel, 
but they were out to defend their 


world. And they were also out to 
avenge the murder of a child. 

The last interview which Ben- 
jacomin had with Lavender in 
striking a bargain before Laven- 
der agreed was a dramatic one. 

Lavender refused to move 
forward. 

“I’m not going to jump off any- 
where. I’m not going to raid 
anything, I’m not going to steal 
anything. I’ve been rough, of 
course I have. But I don’t get my- 
self killed and that’s what you’re 
bloody well asking for.” 

“Think of what we’ll have. The 
wealth. I tell you, there’s more 
money here than anything else 
anybody’s ever tried.” 

Lavender laughed. “You think 
I haven’t heard that before? 
You’re a crook and I’m a crook. 
I don’t go anything that’s on 
speculation. I want my hard cash 
down. I’m a fighting man and 
you’re a thief and I’m not going 
to ask you what you’re up to . 
but I want my money first.” 

“I haven’t got it,” said Benja- 
comin. 

Lavender stood up. 

“Then you shouldn’t have 
talked to me. Because it’s going 
to cost you money to keep me 
quiet whether you hire me or 
not.” 

The bargaining process started. 

Lavender looked ugly indeed. 
He was a soft, ordinary man who 
had gone to a lot of trouble to 


110 


GALAXY 





become evil. Sin is a lot of work. 
The sheer effort it requires often 
shows in the human face. 

Bozart stared him down, smil- 
ing easily, not even contemptu- 
ously. 

“Cover me while I get some- 
thing from my pocket,” said 
Bozart. 

Lavender did not even ac- 
knowledge the comment. He did 
not show a weapon. His left 
thumb moved slowly across the 
outer edge of his hand. Benja- 
comin recognized the sign, but did 
not flinch. 

“See,” he said. “A planetary 
credit.” 

Lavender laughed. “I’ve heard 
that, too.” 

“Take it,” said Bozart. 

The adventurer took the lami- 
nated card. His eyes widened. 
“It’s real,” he breathed. “It is 
real.” He looked up, incalculably 
more friendly. “I never even saw 
one of these before. What are 
your terms?” 

Meanwhile the bright, vivid 
Olympians walked back and forth 
past them, their clothing all white 
and black in dramatic contrast. 
Unbelievable geometric designs 
shone on their cloaks and their 
hats. The two bargainers ignored 
the natives. They concentrated on 
their own negotiations. 

Benjacomin felt fairly safe. He 
placed a pledge of one year’s ser- 
vice of the entire planet of Viola 


Siderea in exchange for the full 
and unqualified services of Cap- 
tain Lavender, once of the Impe- 
rial Marines Internal Space 
Patrol. He handed over the mort- 
gage. The year’s guarantee was 
written in. Even on Olympia there 
were accounting machines which 
relayed the bargain back to Earth 
itself, making the mortgage a 
valid and binding commitment 
against the whole planet of 
thieves. 

“This,” thought Lavender, “was 
the first step of revenge.” After 
the killer had disappeared his 
people would have to pay with 
sheer honesty. Lavender looked 
at Benjacomin with a clinical sort 
of concern. 

Benjacomin mistook his look 
for friendliness and Benjacomin 
smiled his slow, charming, easy 
smile. Momentarily happy, he 
reached out his right hand to give 
Lavender a brotherly solemnifi- 
cation of the bargain. The men 
shook hands, and Bozart never 
knew with what he shook hands.

grass from sky to sky. Not 
near the weir, dear. Not a moun- 
tain, low or high — only hills and 
gray gray. Watch the dappled, 
dimpled twinkles blooming on 
the star bar. 

“That is Norstrilia.

“All the muddy gubbery is 
gone — all the work and the wait- 
ing and the pain. 

“Beige-brown sheep lie on blue- 
gray grass while the clouds rush 
past, low overhead, like iron 
pipes ceilinging the world. 

“Take your pick of sick sheep, 
man, it’s the sick that pays. 
Sneeze me a planet, man, or 
cough me up a spot of immor- 
tality. If it’s barmy there, where 
the noddies and the trolls like 
you live, it’s too right here. 

“That’s the book, boy.

“Charts call it Old North Aus- 
tralia.” 

H ERE in the heart of the world 
was the farm which guarded 
the world. This was the Hitton 
place. 

Towers surrounded it and wires 
hung between the towers, some of 
them drooping crazily and some 
gleaming with the sheen not 
shown by any other metal made 
by men from Earth. Within the 
towers there was open land. And 
within the open land there were 
twelve thousand hectares of con- 
crete. Radar reached down to 
within millimeter smoothness of 
the surface of the concrete and 
the other radar threw patterns 
back and forth, down through 
molecular thinness. The farm 


went on. In its center there was 
a group of buildings. That was 
where Katherine Hitton worked 
on the task which her family had 
accepted for the defense of her 
world. 

No germ came in, no germ went 
out. All the food came in by 
space transmitter. Within this, 
there lived animals. The animals 
depended on her alone. Were she 
to die suddenly, by mischance or 
as a result of an attack by one 
of the animals, the authorities of 
her world had complete facsimiles 
of herself with which to train new 
animal tenders under hypnosis. 

This was a place where the 
gray wind leapt forward released 
from the hills, where it raced 
across the gray concrete, where it 
blew past the radar towers. The 
polished, faceted, captive moon 
always hung due overhead. The 
wind hit the buildings, themselves 
gray, with the impact of a blow, 
before it raced over the open con- 
crete beyond and whistled away 
into the hills. 

Outside the buildings, the 
valley had not needed much 
camouflage. It looked like the rest 
of Norstrilia. The concrete itself 
was tinted very slightly to give 
the impression of poor, starved, 
natural soil. This was the farm, 
and this the woman. Together 
they were the outer defense of 
the richest world mankind had 
ever built. 


MOTHER HITTON'S LITTUL K1TTONS 


113 


Katherine Hitton looked out 
the window and thought to her- 
self, “Forty-two days before I go 
to market and it’s a welcome day 
that I get there and hear the jig 
of a music. 

“Oh, to walk on market day, 

“And see my people proud and 
gay!” 

She breathed deeply of the air. 
She loved the gray hills — though 
in her youth she had seen many 
other worlds. And then she 
turned back into the building to 
the animals and the duties which 
awaited her. She was the only 
Mother Hitton and these were 
her littul kittons. 

OHE moved among them. She 
^ and her father had bred them 
from Earth mink, from the 
fiercest, smallest, craziest little 
minks that had ever been shipped 
out from Manhome. Out of these 
minks they had made their lives 
to keep away other predators 
who might bother the sheep, on 
whom the stroon grew. But these 
minks were born mad. 

Generations of them had been 
bred psychotic to the bone. They 
lived only to die and they died 
so that they could stay alive. 
These were the kittons of Nors- 
trilia. Animals in whom fear, 
rage, hunger and sex were utterly 
intermixed; who could eat them- 
selves or each other; who could 


eat their young, or people, or any- 
thing organic; animals who 
screamed with murder-lust when 
they felt love; animals born to 
loathe themselves with a fierce 
and livid hate and who survived 
only because their waking mo- 
ments were spent on couches, 
strapped tight, claw by claw, so 
that they could not hurt each 
other or themselves. Mother Hit- 
ton let them waken only a few 
moments in each lifetime. They 
bred and killed. She wakened 
them only two at a time. 

All that afternoon she moved 
from cage to cage. The sleeping 
animals slept well. The nourish- 
ment ran into their blood streams; 
they lived sometimes for years 
without awaking. She bred them 
when the males were only partly 
awakened and the females 
aroused only enough to accept her 
veterinary treatments. She her- 
self had to pluck the young away 
from their mothers as the sleep- 
ing mothers begot them. Then she 
nourished the young through a 
few happy weeks of kittonhood, 
until their adult natures began to 
take, their eyes ran red with 
madness and heat and their emo- 
tions sounded in the sharp, hide- 
ous, little cries they uttered 
through the building; and the 
twisting of their neat, furry faces, 
the rolling of their crazy, bright 
eyes and the tightening of their 
sharp, sharp claws. 


114 


GALAXY 


She woke none of them this 
time. Instead, she tightened them 
in their straps. She removed the 
nutrients. She gave them delayed 
stimulus medicine which would, 
when they were awakened, bring 
them suddenly full waking with 
no lulled stupor first. 

Finally, she gave herself a 
heavy sedative, leaned back in a 
chair and waited for the call 
which would come. 

YfTHEN the shock came and 
” the call came through, she 
would have to do what she had 
done thousands of times before. 

She would ring an intolerable 
noise through the whole labora- 
tory. 

Hundreds of the mutated 
minks would awaken. In awaken- 
ing, they would plunge into life 
with hunger, with hate, with rage 
and with sex; plunge against their 
straps; strive to kill each other, 
their young, themselves, her. 
They would fight everything and 
everywhere, and do everything 
they could to keep going. 

She knew this. 

In the middle of the room there 
was a tuner. The tuner was a 
direct, empathic relay, capable of 
picking up the simpler range of 
telepathic communications. Into 
this tuner went the concentrated 
emotions of Mother Hitton’s littul 
kittons. 

The rage, the hate, the hunger, 


the sex were all carried far be- 
yond the limits of the tolerable, 
and then all were thereupon am- 
plified. And then the waveband 
on which this telepathic control 
went out was amplified, right 
there beyond the studio, on the 
high towers that swept the moun- 
tain ridge, up and beyond the 
valley in which the laboratory 
lay. And Mother Hitton’s moon, 
spinning geometrically, bounced 
the relay into a hollow englobe- 
ment. 

From the faceted moon, it went 
to the satellites- — sixteen of them, 
apparently part of the weather 
control system. These blanketed 
not only space, but nearby sub- 
space. The Norstrilians had 
thought of everything. 

The short shocks of an alert 
came from Mother Hitton’s trans- 
mitter bank. 

A call came. Her thumb went 
numb. 

The noise shrieked. 

The mink wakened. 

Immediately, the room was 
full of chattering, scraping, his- 
sing, growling and howling. 

Under the sound of the animal 
voices, there was the other sound: 
a scratchy, snapping sound like 
hail falling on a frozen lake. It 
was the individual claws of hun- 
dreds of mink trying to tear their 
way through metal panels. 

Mother Hitton heard a gurgle. 
One of the minks had succeeded 


MOTHER HITTON'S LITTUL KITTONS 


115 


in tearing its paw loose and had 
obviously started to work on its 
own throat. She recognized the 
tearing of fur, the ripping of 
veins. 

She listened for the cessation 
of that individual voice, but she 
couldn’t be sure. The others were 
making too much noise. One mink 
less. 

Where she sat, she was partly 
shielded from the telepathic relay, 
but not altogether. She herself, 
old as she was, felt queer wild 
dreams go through her. She 
thrilled with hate as she thought 
of beings suffering out beyond 
her — suffering terribly, since they 
were not masked by the built-in 
defenses of the Norstrilian com- 
munications system. 

She felt the wild throb of long- 
forgotten lust. 

She hungered for things she 
had not known she remembered. 
She went through the spasms of 
fear that the hundreds of animals 
expressed. 

Underneath this, her sane 
mind kept asking, “How much 
longer can I take it? How much 
longer must I take it? Lord God, 
be good to your people here on 
this world! Be good to poor old 
me.” 

The green light went on. 

She pressed a button on the 
other side of her chair. The gas 
hissed in. An she passed into un- 
consciousness, she knew that her 

116 


kittons passed into instant un- 
consciousness too. 

She would waken before they 
did and then her duties would 
begin: checking the living ones, 
taking out the one that had 
clawed out its own throat, taking 
out those who had died of heart 
attacks, re-arranging them, , dress- 
ing their wounds, treating them 
alive and asleep — asleep and 
happy — breeding, living in their 
sleep — until the next call should 
come to waken them for the de- 
fense of the treasures which 
blessed and cursed her native 
world. 

VI 

T^VERYTHING had gone ex- 
actly right. Lavender had 
found an illegal planoform ship. 
This was no unconsequential ac- 
complishment, since planoform 
ships were very strictly licensed 
and obtaining an illegal one was 
a chore on which a planet full of 
crooks could easily have worked 
a lifetime. 

Lavender had been lavished 
with money — Benjacomin’s 
money. 

The honest wealth of the 
thieves’ planet had gone in and 
had paid the falsifications and 
great debts, imaginary transac- 
tions that were fed to the 
computers for ships and cargoes 
and passengers that would be 

GALAXY 


| almost untraceably commingled 
in the commerce of 10,000 
worlds. 

“Let him pay for it,” said Lav- 
ender, to one of his confederates, 
an apparent criminal who was 
also a Norstrilian agent. “This is 
paying good money for bad. You 
better spend a lot of it.” 

Just before Benjacomin took 
off Lavender sent on an addi- 
tional message. 

He sent it directly through the 
Go-Captain, who usually did not 
carry messages. The Go-Captain 
was a relay commander of the 
Norstrilian fleet, but he had been 
carefully ordered not to look like 
it. 

The message concerned the 
planoform license — - another 
twenty-odd tablets of stroon 
which could mortgage Viola 
Siderea for hundreds upon hun- 
dreds of years. The Captain said: 
“I don’t have to send that 
through. The answer is yes.” 

Benjacomin came into the con- 
trol room. This was contrary to 
regulations, but he had hired the 
ship to violate regulations. 

The Captain looked at him 
sharply. “You’re a passenger, get 
out.” 

Benjacomin said: “You have 
my little yacht on board. I am 
the only man here outside of your 
people.” 

“Get out. There’s a fine if 
you’re caught here.” 

MOTHER HITTON'S L1TTU 


“It does not matter,” Benjaco- 
min said. “I’ll pay it.” 

“You will, will you?” said the 
Captain. “You would not be pay- 
ing twenty tablets of stroon. 
That’s ridiculous. Nobody could 
get that much stroon.” 

Benjacomin laughed, thinking 
of the thousands of tablets he 
would soon have. All he had to 
do was to leave the planoform 
ship behind, strike once, go past 
the kittons and come back. 

His power and his wealth came 
from the fact that he knew he 
could now reach it. The mort- 
gage of twenty tablets of stroon 
against this planet was a low 
price to pay if it would pay off 
at thousands to one. The Captain 
replied: “It’s not worth it, it just 
is not worth risking twenty tab- 
lets for your being here. But I 
can tell you how to get inside 
the Norstrilian communications 
net if that is worth twenty-seven 
tablets.” 

Benjacomin went tense. 

T^OR a moment he thought he 
might die. All this work, all 
this training — the dead boy on 
the beach, the gamble with the 
credit, and now this unsuspected 
antagonist! 

He decided to face it out. 
“What do you know?” said Ben- 
jacomin. 

“Nothing,” said the Captain. 

“You said ‘Norstrilia.’ ” 

L KITTO N S 117 


“That I did,” said the Captain. 
“If you said Norstrilia, you 
must have guessed it. Who told 
you?” 

“Where else would a man go 
if you look for infinite riches? If 
you get away with it. Twenty 
tablets is nothing to a man like 
you.” 

“It’s two hundred years’ worth 
of work from three hundred 
thousand people,” said Benja- 
comin grimly. 

“When you get away with it, 
you will have more than twenty 
tablets, and so will your people.” 
And Benjacomin thought of 
the thousands and thousands of 
tablets. “Yes, that I know.” 

“If you don’t get away with it, 
you’ve got the card.” 

“That’s right. All right. Get me 
inside the net. I’ll pay the twenty- 
seven tablets.” 

“Give me the card.” 
Benjacomin refused. He was a 
trained thief, and he was alert 
to thievery. Then he thought 
again. This was the crisis of his 
life. He had to gamble a little on 
somebody. 

He had to wager the card. “I’ll 
mark it and then I’ll give it back 
to you.” Such was his excitement 
that Benjacomin did not notice 
that the card went into a duplica- 
tor, that the transaction was re- 
corded, that the message went 
back to Olympic Center, that the 
loss and the mortgage against the 


planet of Viola Siderea should be 
credited to certain commercial 
agencies in Earth for three hun- 
dred years to come. 

Benjacomin got the card back. 
He felt like an honest thief. 

If he did die, the card would be 
lost and his people would not 
have to pay. If he won, he could 
pay that little bit out of his own 
pocket. 

Benjacomin sat down. The Go- 
Captain signalled to his pin- 
lighters. The ship lurched. 

rOR half a subjective hour 
they moved, the Captain 
wearing a helmet of space upon 
his head, sensing and grasping 
and guessing his way, stepping 
to stepping stone, right back to 
his home. He had to fumble the 
passage, or else Benjacomin 
might guess that he was in the 
hands of double agents. 

But the Captain was well 
trained. Just as well trained as 
Benjacomin. 

Agents and thieves, they rode 
together. 

They planoformed inside the 
communications net. Benjacomin 
shook hands with them. “You are 
allowed to materialize as soon as 
I call.” 

“Good luck, sir,” said the Cap- 
tain. 

“Good luck to me,” said Ben- 
jacomin. 

He climbed -into his space

yacht. For less than a second in 
real space, the gray expanse of 
Norstrilia loomed up. The ship 
which looked like a simple ware- 
house disappeared into piano- 
form, and the yacht was on its 


own. 

The yacht dropped. 

As it dropped, Benjacomin had 
a hideous moment of confusion 
and terror. 

He never knew the woman 
down below but she sensed him 
plainly as he received the wrath 
of the much-amplified kittons. 
His conscious mind quivered un- 
der the blow. With a prolonga- 
tion of subjective -experience 
which made one or two seconds 
seem like months of hurt drunken 
bewilderment, Benjacomin Bo- 
zart swept beneath the tide of 
his own personality. The moon 
relay threw minkish minds 
against him. The synapses of his 
brain re-formed to conjure . up 
might-have-beens, terrible things 
that never happened to any man. 
Then his knowing mind whited 
out in an overload of stress. 

His subcortical personality 
lived on a little longer. 

His body fought for several 
minutes. Mad with lust and hun- 
ger, the body arched in the pilot’s 
seat, the mouth bit deep into his 
own arm. Driven by lust, the left 
hand tore at his face, ripping out 
his left eye ball. He screeched 
with animal lust as he tried to 


devour himself . not entirely 
without success. 

The overwhelming telepathic 
message of Mother Hitton’s Lit- 
tul Kittons ground into his brain. 

The mutated minks were fully 
awake. 

The relay satellites had poi- 
soned all the space around him 
with the craziness to which the 
minks were bred. 

Bozart’s body did not live long. 
After a few minutes, the arteries 
were open, the head slumped for- 
ward and the yacht was dropping 
helplessly toward the warehouses 
which it had meant to raid. Nor- 
strilian police picked it up. 

The police themselves were 
ill. All of them were ill. All of 
them were white-faced. Some of 
them had vomited. They had gone 
through the edge of the mink 
defense. They had passed through 
the telepathic band at its thinnest 
and weakest point. This was 
enough to hurt them badly. 

They did not want to know. 

They wanted to forget. 

One of the yonger policemen 
looked at the body and said, 
“What on earth could do that to 
a man?” 

“He picked the wrong job,” 
said the police captain. 

The young policeman said: 
“What’s the wrong job?” 

“The wrong job is trying to 
rob us, boy. We are defended, 
and we don’t want to know how.”

The young policeman, humili- 
ated and on the verge of anger, 
looked almost as if he would 
defy his superior, while keeping 
his eyes away from the body of 
Benjacomin Bozart. 

The older man said: “It’s all 
right. He did not take long to 
die and this is the man who killed 
the boy Johnny, not very long 
ago.”

“Oh, him? So soon?” 

“We brought him.” The old 
police officer nodded. “We let 
him find his death. That’s how 
we live. Tough, isn’t it?” 

r | ''HE ventilators whispered < 
A softly, gently. The animals 
slept again. A jet of air poured 
down on Mother Hitton. The 
telepathic relay was still on. She 
could feel herself, the sheds, the 
faceted moon, the little satellites. | 
Of the robber there was no sign. 

She stumbled to her feet. Her 
raiment was moist with perspira- ’ 
tion. She needed a shower and 
fresh clothes . 

Back at Manhome, the Com- j 
mercial Credit Circuit called 
shrilly for human attention. A 
junior subchief of the Instrumen- < 
tality walked over to the machine 
and held out his hand. 

The machine dropped a card • 
neatly into his fingers. 

He looked at the card. 

“Debit Viola Siderea — credit I 
Earth Contingency — subcredit 1 
Norstrilian account — four hun- 1 
dred million man megayears.” 
Though all alone, he whistled 
to himself in the empty room. 
“We’ll all be dead, stroon or no 
stroon, before they finish paying 
that!” He went off to tell his 
friends the odd news. 

The machine, not getting its 
card back, made another one.

HOW ARE YOU GOING TO 
KEEP THEM DOWN 
ON THE FARM - 
AFTER THEY’VE SEEN 
THE TRUTH?

BREAKDOWN 


121 



H E didn’t know exactly 
when it had started, but 
it had been going on for 
weeks. Edna begged him to see 
the doctor living in that new 
house two miles past Dugan’s 
farm, but he refused. He point- 
blank refused to admit he was 
sick that way — in the head! 

Of course, a man could grow 
forgetful. He had to admit there 
were moments when he had all 
sorts of mixed-up memories and 
thoughts in his mind. And some- 
times — like right now, lying in 
bed beside Edna, watching the 
first hint of light touch the win- 
dows — he began sweating with 
fear. A horrible, gut-wrenching 
fear, all the more horrible be- 
cause it was based on nothing. 

The chicken-run came alive; 
the barn followed minutes later. 
There were chores to do, the 
same chores he’d done all his 
forty-one years. Except that 
now, with the new regulations 
about wheat and corn, he had 
only a vegetable patch to farm. 
Sure, he got paid for letting the 
fields remain empty. But it just 
didn’t seem right, all that land 
going to waste. 

Davie. Blond hair and a 
round, tanned face and strong 
arms growing stronger each day 
from helping out after school. 

He turned and shook Edna. 
“What happened to Davie?” 

She cleared her throat, 

122 


mumbled, “Huh? What happened 
to who?” 

“I said, what . .” But then 
it slipped away. Davie? No, that 
was part of a dream he’d had 
last week. He and Edna had no 
children. 

He felt the fear again, and got 
up fast to escape it. Edna 
opened her eyes as soon as his 
weight left the bed. “Like hot- 
cakes for breakfast?” 

“Eggs,” he said. “Bacon.” And 
then, seeing her face change, he 
remembered. “Course,” he mut- 
tered. “Can’t have bacon. Ra- 
tioned.” 

She was fully awake now. “If 
you’d only go see Dr. Hamming, 
Harry. Just for a checkup. Or 
let me call him so he could — ” 

“You stop that! You stop that 
right now, and for good! I don’t 
want to hear no more about 
doctors. I get laid up, I’ll call 
one. And it won’t be that Ham- 
ming who I ain’t never seen in 
my life! It’ll be Timkins, who 
took care’n us and brought our 
son into the world and. .” 

She began to cry, and he 
realized he’d said something 
crazy again. They had no son, 
never had a son. And Timkins 
— he’d died and they’d gone to 
his funeral. Or so Edna said. 

He himself just couldn’t re- 
member it. 

He went to the bed and sat 
down beside her. “Sorry. That ! 

■

was just a dream I had. I’m still 
half asleep this morning. Couldn’t 
fall off last night, not till 
real late. Guess I’m a little nerv- 
ous, what with all the new regu- 
lations and not working regular. 
I never meant we had a son.” 
He waited then, hoping she’d say 
they had had a son, and he’d 
died or gone away. But of course 
she didn’t. 

T¥E went to the bathroom and 
washed. By the time he 
came to the kitchen, Edna had 
hotcakes on a plate and coffee 
in a cup. He sat down and atq. 
Part way through the meal, he 
paused. “Got an awful craving 
for meat,” he said. “Goddam 
those rations! Man can’t even 
butcher his own stock for his 
own table!” 

“We’re having meat for 
lunch,” she said placatingly. 
“Nice cut of multi-pro.” 

“Multi-pro,” he scoffed. “God 
knows what’s in it. Like spam 
put through a grinder a hundred 
times and then baked into slabs. 
Can’t hardly taste any meat 
there.” 

‘Well, we got no choice. Coun- 
try’s on emergency rations. The 
current crisis, you know.” 

The way she said it irritated 
him. Like it was Scripture; like 
no one could question one word 
of it without being damned to 
Hell. He finished quickly and 

BREAKDOWN 


without speaking went on out to 
the barn. 

He milked and curried and 
fed and cleaned, and still was 
done inside of two hours. Then 
he walked slowly, head down, 
across the hay-strewn floor. He 
stopped, put out his hand as if 
to find a pole or beam that was 
too familiar to require raising 
his eyes, and almost fell as he 
leaned in that direction. Regain- 
ing his balance after a sideward 
staggering shuffle, he looked 
around, startled. “Why, this ain’t 
the way I had my barn. .” 

He heard his own voice, and 
stopped. He fought the flash of 
senseless panic. Of course this 
was the way he’d had his barn 
built, because it was his barn! 

He rubbed his hard hands to- 
gether and said aloud, “Get 
down to the patch. Them toma- 
toes need fertiliser for tang.” He 
walked outside and took a deep 
breath. Air was different, wasn’t 
it? Sweet and pure and clean, 
like country air always was and 
always would be; but still, dif- 
ferent somehow. Maybe sharper. 
Or was sharp the word? May- 
be. 

He went quickly across the 
yard, past the pig-pen — he’d 
had twelve pigs, hadn’t he? Now 
he had four — behind the house 
to where the half-acre truck farm 
lay greening in the sun. He got 
to work. Sometime later, Edna 

123 




called to him. “Delivery last 
night, Harry. I took some. Pick 
up rest?” 

“Yes,” he shouted. 

She disappeared. 

He walked slowly back to the 
house. As he came into the front 
yard, moving toward the road 
and the supply bin, something 
occurred to him. The car. He 
hadn’t seen the old Chewy in. 
how long? It’d be nice to take a 
ride to town, see a movie, may- 
be have a few beers. 

No. It was against the travel 
regulations. He couldn’t go 
further than Walt and Gloria 
Shanks’ place. They couldn’t go 
further than his. And the gas 
rationing. Besides, he’d sold the 
car, hadn’t he? Because it was 
no use to him lying in the tractor 
shed. 

H E whirled, staring out across 
the fields to his left. Why, 
the tractor shed had stood just 
fifty feet from the house! 

No, he’d torn it down. The 
tractor was in town, being over- 
hauled and all. He was leaving 
it there until he had use for it. 

He went on toward the road, 
his head beginning to throb. 
Why should a man his age, 
hardly sick at all since he was a 
kid, suddenly start losing hold 
this way? Edna was worried. 
The Shanks had noticed it too. 
He was at the supply bin — 


like an old-fashioned wood bin; 
a box with a sloping flap lid. De- 
liveries of food and clothing and 
home medicines and other things 
were left here. You wrote down 
what you needed, and they left 
it — or whatever they allowed 
you — with a bill. You paid the 
bill by leaving money in the bin, 
and the next week you found a 
receipt and your new stuff and 
your new bill. And almost al- 
ways you found some money 
from the government, for not 
planting wheat or not planting 
corn. It came out just about 
even. 

He hauled out a sack of flour, 
half the amount of sugar Edna 
had ordered, some dried fruit, a 
new Homekit Medicine Shelf. 
He carried it into the house, and 
noticed a slip of paper pinned 
to the sugar bag. A television 
program guide. 

Edna hustled over excitedly. 
“Anything good on this week, 
Harry?” 

He looked down the listings, 
and frowned. “All old movies. 
Still only one channel. Still only 
from nine to eleven at night.” 
He gave it to her, turned away; 
then stopped and waited. He’d 
said the same thing last week. 
And she had said the films were 
all new to her. 

She said it now. “Why Harry, 
I’ve never seen this movie with 
Clark Gable. Nor the comedy 


124 


GALAXY 


with Red Skeleton. Nor the other 
five neither.” 

“I’m gonna lie down,” he said 
flatly. He turned and stepped 
forward, and found himself fac- 
ing the stove. Not the door to 
the hall; the stove. “But the 
door. .” he began. He cut him- 
self short. He turned and saw 
the door a few feet to the left, 
beside the table. He went there 
and out and up the stairs (they 
too had moved; they too weren’t 
right) and into the bedroom and 
lay down. The bedroom was 
wrong. The bed was wrong. The 
windows were wrong. 

The world was wrong! Lord, 
the whole damned world was 
wrong! 

T^DNA didn’t wake him, so they 
had a late lunch. Then he 
went back to the barn and let 
the four cows and four sheep 
and two horses into the pastures. 
Then he checked to see that 
Edna had fed the chickens right. 
They had only a dozen or so 
now. 

When had he sold the rest? 
And when had he sold his other 
livestock? 

Or had they died somehow? 
A rough winter? Disease? 

He stood in the yard, a tall, 
husky man with pale brown hair 
and a face that had once been 
long, lean and strong and was 
now only long and lean. He 


blinked gray eyes and tried hard 
to remember, then turned and 
went to the house. Edna was 
soaking dishes in the sink, ac- 
cording to regulations — one 
sinkful of dishwater a day. And 
one tub of bath water twice a 
week. 

She was looking at him. He 
realized his anger and confusion 
must be showing. He managed a 
smile. “You remember how much 
we got for our livestock, Edna?” 

“Same as everyone else,” she 
said. “Government agents paid 
flat rates.” 

He remembered then, or 
thought he did. The headache 
was back. He went upstairs and 
slept again, but this time he had 
dreams, many of them, and all 
confused and all frightening. He 
was glad to get up. And he was 
glad to hear Walt and Gloria 
talking to Edna downstairs. 

He washed his face, combed 
his hair and went down. Walt 
and Gloria were sitting on the 
sofa, Edna in the blue armchair. 
Walt was saying he’d gotten the 
new TV picture tube he’d 
ordered. “Found it in the supply 
bin this morning. Spent the 
whole day installing it according 
to the book of directions.” 

Harry said hi and they all 
said hi and he sat down and they 
talked about TV and gardens 
and livestock. Then Harry said, 
“How’s Penny?” 


BREAKDOWN 


125 


“Fine,” Gloria answered. “Fm 
starting her on the kindergarten 
book next week.” 

“She’s five already?” Harry 
asked. 

“Almost six,” Walt said. 
“Emergency Education Regula- 
tions state that the child should 
be five years nine months old 
before embarking on kinder- 
garten book.” 

“And Frances?” Harry asked. 
“Your oldest? She must be start- 
ing high. .” He stopped, because 
they were all staring at him, and 
because he couldn’t remember 
Frances clearly. “Just a joke,” he 
said, laughing and rising. “Let’s 
eat. I’m starved.” 

r ’|''HEY ate in the kitchen. They 
talked — or rather Edna, 
Gloria and Walt did. Harry 
nodded and said uh-huh and 
used his mouth for chewing. 

Walt and Gloria went home at 
ten-fifteen. They said goodbye at 
the door and Harry walked 
away. He heard Gloria whisper- 
ing something about Doctor 
Hamming. 

He was sitting in the living 
living room when Edna came in. 
She was crying. “Harry, please 
see the doctor.” 

He got up. “I’m going out. I 
might even sleep out!” 

“But why, Harry, why?” 

He couldn’t stand to see her 
crying. He went to her, kissed 


her wet cheek, spoke more 
softly. “It’ll do me good, like 
when I was a kid.” 

“If you say so, Harry.” 

He left quickly. He went out- 
side and across the yard to the 
road. He looked up it and down 
it, to the north and to the south. 
It was a bright night with moon 
and stars, but he saw nothing, 
no one. The road was empty. It 
was always empty, except when 
Walt and Gloria walked over 
from their place a mile or so 
south. But once it hadn’t been 
empty. Once there’d been cars, 
people . 

He had to do something. Just 
sitting and looking at the sky 
wouldn’t help him. He had to 
go somewhere, see someone. 

He went to the barn and 
looked for his saddle. There was 
no saddle. But he’d had one 
hanging right behind the door. 
Or had he? 

He threw a blanket over 
Plum, the big mare, and tied it 
with a piece of wash line. He 
used another piece for a bridle, 
since he couldn’t find that either, 
and didn’t bother making a bit. 
He mounted, and Plum moved 
out of the barn and onto the 
road. He headed north, toward 
town. 

Then he realized he couldn’t 
go along the road this way. He’d 
be reported. Breaking travel 
regulations was a serious offense. 


126 


GALAXY 


He didn’t know what they did 
to you, but it wasn’t anything 
easy like a fine. 

He cut into an unfenced, un- 
planted field. 

His headache was back, worse 
now than it had ever been. His' 
entire head throbbed, and he 
leaned forward and put his 
cheek against Plum’s mane. The 
mare whinnied uneasily, but he 
kicked her sides and she moved 
forward. He lay there, just want- 
ing to go somewhere, just want- 
ing to leave his headache and 
confusion behind. 

He didn’t know how long it 
was, but Plum was moving cau- 
tiously now. He raised his head. 
They were approaching a fence. 
He noticed a gate off to the 
right, and pulled the rope so 
Plum went that way. They 
reached the gate and he got 
down to open it, and saw the 
sign. “Phineas Grotton Farm.” 
He looked up at the sky, found 
the constellations, turned his 
head, and nodded. He’d started 
north, and Plum had continued 
north. He’d crossed land belong- 
ing both to himself and the 
Franklins. Now he was leaving 
the Franklin farm. North of the 
Franklins were the Bessers. Who 
was this Phineas Grotton? Had 
he bought out Lon Besser? But 
anything like that would’ve 
gotten around. 

Was he forgetting again? 


VW/ r ELL, no matter. Mr. Grot- 
™ ton would have to excuse 
his trespass. He opened the gate, 
led Plum through it, closed the 
gate. He mounted and rode for- 
ward, still north, toward the 
small Pangborn place and after 
the Pangborns the biggest farm 
in the county — old Wallace 
Elverton’s place. The fields 
here, as everywhere in the coun- 
ty, lay fallow. Seemed as if the 
government had so much grain 
stored up they’d be able to get 
along without crops for years 
more. 

He looked around. Somehow, 
the country bothered him. He 
wasn’t sure why, but . every- 
thing was wrong. 

His head weighed an agonized 
ton. He put it down again. Plum 
went sedately forward. After a 
while she stopped. Harry looked 
up. Another fence. And what a 
fence! About ten feet of heavy 
steel mesh, topped by three feet 
of barbed-wire — five separate 
strands. What in the world had 
Sam Pangborn been thinking of 
to put up a monster like this? 

He looked around. The gate 
should be further west. He rode 
that way. He found no gate. He 
turned back, heading east. No 
gate. Nothing but fence. And 
wasn’t the fence gradually curv- 
ing inward? He looked back. 
Yes, there was a slight inward 
curve. 


BREAKDOWN 


127 







He dismounted and tied Plum 
to the fence, then stepped back 
and figured the best way to get 
to the other side. 

The best way, the only way, 
was to claw, clutch and clamber, 
as they used to say back when 
he was a kid. 

It took some doing. He tore his 
shirt on the barbed wire, but he 
got over and began walking, 
straight ahead, due north. The 
earth changed beneath his feet. 
He stooped and touched it. 
Sand. Hard-packed sand. He’d 
never seen the like of it in this 
county. 

He walked on. A sound came 
to him; a rising-falling whisper. 
He listened to it, and looked up 
every so often at the sky, to 
make sure he was heading in the 
right direction. 

And the sand ended. His shoes 
plunked over flooring. 

Flooring! 

He knelt to make sure, and 
his hand felt wooden planks. He 
rose, and glanced up to see if 
he was still outdoors. Then he 
laughed. It was a sick laugh, so 
he stopped it. 

He took another step. His 
shoes sounded against the wood. 
He walked. More wood. Wood 
that went on, as the sand had. 
And the roaring sound growing 
louder. And the air changing, 
smelling like air never had be- 
fore in Cultwait County. 


TTIS entire body trembled. His 

A mind trembled too. He 
walked, and cam6 to a waist-high 
metal railing, and made a tiny 
sound deep in his throat. He 
looked out over water, endless 
water rolling in endless waves 
under the night sky. Crashing 
water, topped with reflected sil- 
ver from the moon. Pounding 
water, filling the air with spray. 

He put out his hands and 
grasped the railing. It was wet. 
He raised damp fingers to his 
mouth. Salt. 

He stepped back, back, and 
turned and ran. He ran wildly, 
blindly, until he could run no 
more. Then he fell, feeling the 
sand beneath him, and shut his 
eyes and mind to everything. 

Much later, he got up and 
went to the fence and climbed it. 
He came down on the other side 
and looked around and saw 
Plum. He walked to her, 
mounted her, sat still. The 
thoughts, or dreams, or what- 
ever they were which had been 
torturing him these past few 
weeks began torturing him 
again. 

It was getting light. His head 
was splitting. 

Davie. His son Davie. Four- 
teen years old. Going to high 
school in town. 

Town! He should’ve gone 
there in the first place! He 
would ride east, to the road, 


129 


then head south, back toward 
home. That would bring him 
right down Main Street. Regu- 
lations or not, he’d talk to peo- 
ple, find out what was hap- 
pening. 

He kicked Plum’s sides. The 
mare began to move. He kept 
kicking until she broke into a 
brisk canter. He held on with 
hands and legs. 

Why hadn’t he seen the Pang- 
borns and Elvertons lately — a 
long time lately? 

The ocean. He’d seen the 
ocean. Not a reservoir or lake 
made by flooding and by dam- 
ming, but salt water and enor- 
mous. An ocean, where there 
could be no ocean. The Pang- 
boms and Elvertons had been 
where that ocean was now. And 
after the Elvertons had come the 
Dobsons. And after them the 
new plastics plant. And after 
that the city of Crossville. And 
after that. 

He was passing his own farm. 
He hadn’t come through town, 
and yet here he was at his own 
farm. Could he have forgotten 
where town was? Could it be 
north of his home, not south? 
Could a man get so confused as 
to forget things he’d known all 
his life? 

He reached the Shanks’ place, 
and passed if at a trot. Then he 
was beyond their boundaries and 
breaking regulations again. He 


stayed on the road. He went 
by a small house and saw 
colored folks in the yard. There’d 
been no colored folks here. 
There’d been Eli Bergen and his 
family and his mother, in a 
bigger, newer house. The colored 
folks heard Plum’s hooves and 
looked up and stared. Then a 
man raised his voice. “Mistah, 
you breakin’ regulations! Mistah, 
the police gonnah get you!” 

TIE rode on. He came to an- 
other house, neat and white, 
with three children playing on 
a grassy lawn. They saw him and 
ran inside. A moment later, adult 
voices yelled after him: 

“You theah! Stop!” 

“Call the sheriff! He’s headin’ 
foah Piney Woods!” 

There was no place called 
Piney Woods in this county. 

Was this how a man’s mind 
went? 

He came to another house, 
and another. He passed ten all 
told, and people shouted at him 
for breaking regulations, and the 
last three or four sounded like 
Easterners. And their houses 
looked like pictures of New Eng- 
land he’d seen in magazines. 

He rode on. He never did 
come to town. He came to a ten- 
foot fence with a three-foot 
barbed-wire extension. He got off 
Plum and ripped his clothing 
climbing. He walked over hard- 


130

packed sand, and then wood, and 
came to a low metal railing. He 
- looked out at the ocean, gleaming 
in bright sunlight, surging and 
seething endlessly. He felt the 
earth sway beneath him. He stag- 
gered, and dropped to his hands 
and knees, and shook his head 
like a fighter hit too many times. 
Then he got up and went back to 
the fence and heard a sound. It 
was a familiar sound, yet strange 
too. He shaded his eyes against 
the climbing sun. Then he saw 
it — a car. A car! 

TT was one of those tiny foreign 
*■ jobs that run on practically no 
gas at all. It stopped beside him 
and two men got out. Young men 
with lined, tired faces; they wore 
policemen’s uniforms. “You 
broke regulations, Mr. Burr. 
You’ll have to come with us.” 
He nodded. He wanted to. He 
wanted to be taken care of. He 
turned toward Plum. 

The other officer was walking 
around the horse. “Rode her 
hard,” he said, and he sounded 
real worried. “Shouldn’t have 
done that, Mr. Burr. We have so 
very few now. .” 

The officer holding Harry’s 
arm said, “Pete.” 

The officer examining Plum 
said, “It won’t make any differ- 
ence in a while.” 

Harry looked at both of them, 
and felt sharp, personal fear. 

BREAKDOWN 


“Take the horse back to his 
farm,” the officer holding Harry 
said. He opened the door of the 
little car and pushed Harry in- 
side. He went around to the 
driver’s side and got behind the 
wheel and drove away. Harry 
looked back. Pete was leading 
Plum after them; not riding him, 
walking him. “He sure must like 
horses,” he said. 

“Yes.” 

“Am I going to jail?” 

“No.” 

‘Where then?” 

“The doctor’s place.” 

They stopped in front of the 
new house two miles past 
Dugan’s farm. Except he’d never 
seen it before. Or had he? Every- 
one seemed to know about it — 
or was everyone only Edna and 
the Shanks? 

He got out of the car. The 
officer took his arm and led him 
up the path. Harry noticed that 
the new house was big. 

When they came inside, he 
knew it wasn’t like any house 
he’d ever seen or heard of. There 
was this long central passageway, 
and dozens of doors branched off 
it on both sides, and stairways 
went down from it in at least 
three places that he could see, 
and at the far end — a good two 
hundred yards away — a big 
ramp led upward. And it was all 
gray plaster walls and dull black 
floors and cold white lighting, 


131 


like a hospital, or a modern fac- 
tory, or maybe a government 
building. Except that he didn’t 
see or hear people. 

He did hear something; a low, 
rumbling noise. The further they 
came along the hall, the louder 
the rumbling grew. It seemed to 
be deep down somewhere. 

r T , HEY went through one of the 
doors on the. right, into a 
windowless room. A thin little 
man with bald head and frame- 
less glasses was there, putting on 
a white coat. His veiny hands 
shook. He looked a hundred 
years old. “Where’s Petey?” he 
asked. 

“Pete’s all right, Dad. Just 
leading a horse back to Burr’s 
farm.” 

The old man sighed. “I didn’t 
know what form it would take. I 
expected one or two cases, but 
I couldn’t predict whether it 
would be gradual or sudden, 
whether or not it would lead to 
violence.” 

“No violence, Dad.” 

“Fine, Stan.” He looked at 
Harry. “I’m going to give you a 
little treatment, Mr. Burr. It’ll 
settle your nerves and make 
everything. .” 

‘What happened to Davie?” 
Harry asked, things pushing at 
his brain again. 

Stan helped him up. “Just step 
this way, Mr. Burr.” 


He didn’t resist. He went 
through the second door into the 
room with the big chair. He sat 
down and let them strap his arms 
and legs and let them lower the 
metal thing over his head. He 
felt needles pierce his scalp and 
the back of his neck. He let them 
do what they wanted; he would 
let them kill him if they wanted. 
All he asked was one answer so 
as to know whether or not he 
was insane. 

“What happened to my son 
Davie?” 

The old man walked across 
the room and examined what 
looked like the insides of a dozen 
big radios. He turned, his hand 
on a switch. 

“Please,” Harry whispered. 
“Just tell me about my son.” 

The doctor blinked behind his 
glasses, and then his hand left 
the switch. “Dead,” he said, his 
voice a rustling of dried leaves. 
“Like so many millions of others. 
Dead, when the bombs fell. 
Dead, as everyone knew they 
would be and no one did any- 
thing to prevent. Dead. Perhaps 
the whole world is dead — ex- 
cept for us.” 

Harry stared at him. 

64T can’t take the time to ex- 
plain it all. I have too 
much to do. Just three of us — 
myself and my two sons. My 
wife lost her mind. I should have 


132 


GALAXY 


helped her as I’m helping you.” 
“I don’t understand,” Harry 
said. “I remember people, and 
things, and where are they now? 
Dead? People can die, but farms, 
cities. .” 

“I haven’t the time,” the doc- 
tor repeated, voice rising. “I have 
to run a world. Three of us, to 
run a world! I built it as best I 
could, but how large could I 
make it? The money. The years 
and years of work. The people 
calling me insane when they 
found out . but a few giving 
me more money, and the work 
going on. And those few caught 
like everyone else, unprepared 
when the holocaust started, un- 
prepared and unable to reach 
my world. So they died. As I 
knew they would. As they should 
have known they would.” 

Harry felt the rumbling be- 
neath him. Engines? 

“You survived,” the doctor 
said. “Your wife. A few hundred 
others in the rural areas. One 
other family in your area. I sur- 
vived because I lived for surviv- 
al, like a mole deep in the earth, 
expecting the catastrophe every 
minute. I survived because I 
gave up living to survive.” He 
laughed, high and thin. 

His son said, “Please, Dad. .” 
“No! I want to talk to some- 
one sane! You and Petey and I 
— we’re all insane, you know. 
Three years now, playing God, 


waiting for some land, any land, 
to become habitable. And know- 
ing everything, and surrounded 
by people who are sane only 
because I made sure they would 
know nothing.” He stepped for- 
ward, glaring at Harry. “Now do 
you understand? I went across 
the country, picking up a few of 
the few left alive. Most were 
farmers, and even where some 
weren’t I picked the farmers 
anyway. Because farmers are 
what we’ll need, and all the rest 
can evolve later. I put you and 
the others, eighty-six all told, 
from every section of the coun- 
try, on my world, the only un- 
contaminated land left. I gave 
you back your old lives. I 
couldn’t give you big crops be- 
cause we don’t need big crops. 
We would only exhaust our 
limited soil with big crops. But 
I gave you vegetable gardens 
and livestock and, best of all, 
sanity! I wiped the insane mo- 
ments from your minds. I gave 
you peace and consigned myself, 
my sons, my own wife. .” 

He choked and stopped. 

Stan ran across the room to 
the switch. Harry watched him, 
and his brain struggled with an 
impossible concept. He heard 
the engines and remembered the 
ocean on two sides; on four 
sides had he bothered to check 
south and east; on all sides if 
that fence continued to curve in-

ward. Ocean, and there was no 
ocean in Iowa. 

And this wasn’t Iowa. 

The explosions had ripped the 
world, and he’d tried to get to 
town to save Davie, and there’d 
been no town and there’d been 
no people and there’d been only 
death and poison in the air and 
even those few people left had 
begun to die, and then the truck 
with the huge trailer had come, 
the gleaming trailer with the 
little man and his trembling wife 
and his two sons. 

SUDDENLY, he understood. 
^ And understanding brought 
not peace but the greatest terror 
he’d ever known. He screamed, 
“We’re on. .” but the switch was 
thrown and there was no more 
speech. For an hour. Then he got 
out of the chair and said, “Sure 
glad I took my wife’s advice and 
came to see you, Doctor Ham- 
ming. I feel better already, and 
after only one . What do you 
call these treatments?” 

“Diathermy,” the little doctor 
muttered. 

Harry gave him a five-dollar 


bill. The doctor gave him two 
singles in change. “That’s cer- 
tainly reasonable enough,” Harry 
said. 

The doctor nodded. “There’s a 
police officer in the hall. He’ll 
drive you home so there won’t 
be any trouble with the travel 
regulations.” 

Harry said, “Thanks. Think 
we’ll ever see the end of travel 
regulations and rationing and all 
the rest of the emergency?” 

“You will, Mr. Burr.” 

Harry walked to the door. 

“We’re on an ark,” the doctor 
said. 

Harry turned around, smiling. 
“What?” 

“A test, Mr. Burr. You passed 
it. Goodbye.” 

Harry went home. He told 
Edna he felt just great! She said 
she’d been worried when an of- 
ficer found Plum wandering on 
the road; she thought maybe 
Harry had gone off somewhere 
and broken travel regulations. 

“Me?” he exclaimed, amazed. 
“Break travel regulations? I’d as 
soon kill a pig!”

By FRANK HERBERT 

Illustrated by GAUGHAN 


T HE MORNING the space 
armor problem fell into the 
agency’s lap, Gwen Everest 
had breakfast at her regular res- 
taurant, an automated single- 
niche place catering to bachelor 
girls. Her order popped out of 
the slot onto her table, and 
immediately the tabletop pro 
jecta-menu switched to selling 
Interdorma’s newest Interpretive 
Telelog. 

“Your own private dream 
translator! The secret companion 
to every neurosis!” 


Gwen stared at the inch-high 
words doing a skitter dance 
above her fried eggs. She had 
written that copy. Her food be- 
neath the ad looked suddenly 
tasteless. She pushed the plate 
away.- 

Along the speedwalk into 
Manhattan a you-seeker, its robo- 
flier senses programmed to her 
susceptibilities, flew beside her 
ear. It was selling a year’s supply 
of Geramyl — “the breakfast 
drink that helps you LIVE long- 
er!” 

The selling hook this morning 
was a Gwen Everest idea: a life 
insurance policy with the first 
year’s premiums paid — “abso- 
lutely FREE if you accept this 
offer now!” 

In sudden anger, she turned on 
the roboflier, whispered a code 
phrase she had wheedled from 
an engineer who serviced the 
things. The roboflier darted up- 
ward in sudden erratic flight, 
crashed into the side of a build- 
ing. 

A small break in her control. 
A beginning. 

Waiting for Gwen along the 
private corridor to the Single- 
master, Hucksting and Battle- 
mont executive offices were dis- 
plays from the recent Religion of 
the Month Club campaign. She 
ran a gamut of adecals, layouts, 
slogans, projos, quartersheets, 
skinnies. The works. 


“Subscribe now and get these 
religions absolutely FREE! Com- 
plete text of the Black Mass plus 
Abridged Mysticism!” 

She was forced to walk through 
an adecal announcing: “Don’t be 
Half Safe! Believe in Everything! 
Are you sure that African Bantu 
Witchcraft is not the True Way?” 

At the turn of the corridor 
stood a male-female graphic with 
flesh-stimulant skinnies and sup- 
ered voices, “Find peace through 
Tantrism.” 

The skinnies made her flesh 
crawl. 

Gwen fled into her office, 
slumped into her desk chair. 
With mounting horror, she real- 
ized that she had either written 
or supervised the writing of every 
word, produced every selling idea 
along that corridor. 

The interphon on her desk 
emitted its fluted “Good morn- 
ing.” She slapped the blackout 
switch to keep the instrument 
from producing an image. The 
last thing she wanted now was to 
see one of her co-workers. 

“Who is it?” she barked. 

“Gwen?” No mistaking that 
voice: Andre Battlemont, bottom 
name on the agency totem. 

‘What do you want?” she de- 
manded. 

“Our Gwenny is feeling nasty 
this morning, isn’t she?” 

“Oh, Freud!” She slapped the 
disconnect, leaned forward with 


136 


GALAXY 


elbows on the desk, put her face 
in her hands. Lefs face it, she 
thought. I’m 48, unmarried, and 
a prime mover in an industry 
that’s strangling the universe. I’m 
a professioned strangler. 

“Good morning,” fluted the in- 
terphon. 

She ignored it. 

“A strangler,” she said. 

Gwen recognized the basic 
problem here. She had known it 
since childhood. Her universe 
was a continual replaying of “The 
Emperor’s New Suit.” She saw 
the nakedness. 

“Good morning,” fluted the in- 
terphon. 

She dropped her right hand 
away from her face, flicked the 
switch. “Now what?” 

“Did you cut me off, Gwen?” 
“What if I did?” 

“Gwen, please! We have a 
problem.” 

“We always have problems.” 
Battlemont’s voice dropped 
one octave. “Gwen. This is a Big 
problem.” 

Uncanny the way he can speak 
capital letters, she thought. She 
said: “Go away.” 

“You’ve been leaving your In- 
terdorma turned off!” accused 
Battlemont. “You mustn’t. Neur- 
osis can creep up on you.” 

“Is that why you called me?” 
she asked. 

“Of course not.” 

“Then go away.” 


Battlemont did a thing then 
that everyone from Singlemaster 
on down knew was dangerous to 
try with Gwen Everest. He 
pushed the override to send his 
image dancing above her inter- 
phon. 

A FTER the momentary flash 
of anger, Gwen correctly in- 
terpreted the act as one of des- 
peration. She found herself 
intrigued. She stared at the round 
face, the pale eyes (definitely too 
small, those eyes), the pug nose 
and wide gash of mouth above 
almost no chin at all. 

Plus the hairline in full retreat. 
“Andre, you are a mess,” she 
said. 

He ignored the insult. Still 
speaking in the urgency octave, 
he said: “I have called a full staff 
meeting. You must attend at 
once.” 

“Why?” 

“There are two military people 
in there, Gwen.” He gulped. “It’s 
desperate. Either we solve their 
problem or they will ruin us. 
They will draft every man in the 
agency!” 

“Even you?” 

“Yes!” 

She moved her right hand 
toward the interphon’s emergen- 
cy disconnect. “Good-by, Andre.” 
“Gwen! My God! You can’t let 
me down at a time like this!” 
“Why not?”

He spoke in breathless haste. 
“We’ll raise your salary. A bonus. 
A bigger office. More help.” 

“You can’t afford me now,” 
she said. 

“I’m begging you, Gwen. Must 
you abuse me?” 

She closed her eyes, thought: 
The insects! The damned little 
insects with their crummy emo- 
tions! Why can’t l tell them all 
to go to composite hell? She 
opened her- eyes, said: “What’s 
the military’s flap?” 

Battlemont mopped his fore- 
head with a pastel blue handker- 
chief. “It’s the Space Service,” he 
said. “The female branch. The 
WOMS. Enlistments have fallen 
to almost nothing.” 

She was interested in spite of 
herself. “What’s happened?” 
“Something to do with the 
space armor. I don’t know. I’m 
so upset.” 

‘Why have they tossed it into 
our laps like this? The ultimatum, 
I mean.” 

Battlemont glanced left and 
right, leaned forward. “The grape- 
vine has it they’re testing a new 
theory that creative people work 
better under extreme stress.” 
“The Psychological Branch 
again,” she said. “Those jack- 
asses!” 

“But what can we do?” 

“Hoist ’em,” she said. “You 
run along to the conference.” 
“And you’ll be there, Gwen?” 


“In a few minutes.” 

“Don’t delay too long, Gwen.” 
Again he mopped his forehead 
with the blue handkerchief. 
“Gwen, I’m frightened.” 

“And with good reason.” She 
squinted at him. “I can see you 
now: Nothing on but a lead loin- 
cloth, dumping fuel into a radio- 
active furnace. Freud, what a 
picture!” 

“This is no joke, Gwen!” 

“I know.” 

“You are going to help?” 

“In my own peculiar way, 
Andre.” She hit the emergency 
disconnect. 

A NDRE Battlemont turned 
away from his interphon, 
crossed his office to a genuine 
Moslem prayer rug. He sat down 
on it facing the floor-to-ceiling 
windows that looked eastward 
across midtown Manhattan. This 
was the 1479th floor of the Stars 
of Space building, and it was 
quite a view out there whenever 
the clouds lifted. But the city 
remained hidden beneath a low 
ceiling this morning. 

Up here it was sunny, though 
— except in Battlemont’s mood. 
A fear-cycle ululated along his 
nerves. 

What he was doing on the 
prayer rug was practicing Yoga 
breathing to calm those nerves. 
The military could wait. They 
had to wait. The fact that he 


138 


GALAXY 


faced the general direction of 
Mecca was left over from two 
months before. Yoga was a month 
old. There was always some 
carry-over. 

Battlemont had joined the Re- 
ligion of the Month Club almost 
a year ago — seduced by his 
own agency’s deep motivation 
campaign plus the Brotherhood 
Council’s seal of approval. 

This month it was the Rein- 
.Spired Neo-Cult of St. Freud. 

A test adecal superimposed 
itself on the cloud-floor view 
beneath him. It began playing 
the latest Gwen-Everest-inspired 
pitch of the IBMausoleum. Giant 
rainbow letters danced across 
the fleecy background. 

“Make your advice immortal! 
.Let us store your voice and 
thought patterns in everlasting 
electronic memory circuits! When 
you are gone, your loved ones 
may listen to your voice as you 
answer their questions exactly 
the way you would most likely 
have answered them in Life!” 

Battlemont shook his head. 
The agency, fearful of its de- 
pendence on the live Gwen Ever- 
est, had secretly recorded her at 
a staff conference once. Very 
illegal. The unions were death on 
it. But the IBMausoleum had 
broken down with the first ques- 
tion put to Gwen’s ghost-voice. 

“Some people have thought 
patterns that are too complex to 

A-W-F UNLIMITED 


permit accurate psyche-record,” 
the engineer explained. 

Battlemont did not delude him- 
self. The sole genius of the 
agency’s three owners lay in 
recognizing the genius of Gwen 
Everest. She was the agency. 

It was like riding the tiger to 
have such an employee. Single- 
master, Hucksting and Battle- 
mont had ridden this tiger for 
22 years. Battlemont closed his 
eyes, pitched her in his mind: a 
tall, lean woman, but with a cer- 
tain grace. Her face was long, 
dominated by cold blue eyes, 
framed in waves of auburn hair. 
She had a wit that could slash 
you to ribbons, and that priceless 
commodity: the genius to pull 
selling sense out of utter confu- 
sion. 

Battlemont sighed. 

He was in love with Gwen 
Everest. Had been for 22 years. 
It was the reason he had never 
married. His Interdorma ex- 
plained that it was because he 
wanted to be dominated by a 
strong woman. 

But that only explained. It 
didn’t help. 

For a moment, he thought 
wistfully of Singlemaster and 
Hucksting, both taking their an- 
nual three-month vacation at the 
geriatrics center on Oahu. Battle- 
mont wondered if he dared ask 
Gwen to take her vacation with 
him. Just once. 

139 





No. 

He realized what a pitiful fig- 
ure he made on the prayer rug. 
Pudgy little man in a rather un- 
attractive blue suit. 

Tailors did things for him that 
they called “improving your good 
points.” But except when he 
viewed himself in a Vesta-Mirror 
to see the sample clothes pro- 
jected back onto his own ideal- 
ized image, he could never pin 
down what those “good points” 
were. 

Gwen would certainly turn him 
down. 

He feared that more than any- 
thing. As long as there remained 
the possibility . 

Memory of the waiting Space 
Service deputation intruded. Bat- 
tlemont trembled, broke the Yo- 
ga breathing pattern. The exer- 
cise was having its usual effect: 
a feeling of vertigo. He heaved 
himself to his feet. 

“One cannot run away from 
fate,” he muttered. 

That was a carry-over from the 
Karma month. 

A CCORDING to Gwen, the 
agency’s conference room 
had been copied from a Floren- 
tine bordello’s Emperor Room. 
It was a gigantic space. The cor- 
ners were all flossy curliques in 
heavy gilding, an effect carried 
over into deep carvings on the 
wall panels. The ceiling was a 


mating of Cellini cupids with 
Dali landscapes. 

Period stuff. Antique. 

Into this baroque setting had 
been forced a one-piece table 6 
feet wide and 42 feet long. It 
was an enlarged bit of Twentieth 
Century Wallstreetiana fenced in 
by heavy wooden chairs. Bean- 
bag paperweights and golden 
wheel ashtrays graced every 
place. 

The air of the room was blue 
with the smoke of mood-cigs. (“It 
rhymes with Good Bigs!”) The 
staff seated around the table was 
fighting off the depressant effect 
of the two Space Service gener- 
als, one male and one female, 
seated in flanking positions be- 
side Battlemont’s empty chair. 
There was a surprising lack of 
small talk and paper rustling. 

All staff members had learned 
of the ultimatum via the office 
grapevine. 

Battlemont slipped in his side 
door, crossed to his chair at the 
end of the table, dropped into it 
before his knees gave out. He 
stared from one frowning mili- 
tary face to the other. 

No response. 

He cleared his throat. “Sorry 
I’m . ah . Pressing business. 
Unavoidable.” He cast a frantic 
glance around the table. No sign 
of Gwen. He smiled at one offi- 
cer, the other. 

No response.

GALAXY 


On his right sat Brigadier Gen- 
eral Sonnet Finnister of the 
WOMS (Women of Space). Bat- 
tlemont had been appalled to see 
her walk. Drill-sergeant stride. 
No nonsense. She wore a self-de- 
signed uniform: straight pleated 
skirt to conceal bony hips, a loose 
blouse to camouflage lack of 
upper development, and a long 
cape to confuse the whole issue. 
Atop her head sat a duck-billed, 
flat-fronted cap that had been 
fashioned for the single purpose 
of hiding the Sonnet Finnister 
forehead, which went too high 
and too wide. 

She seldom removed the hat. 

(This particular hat, Battle- 
mont’s hurried private investiga- 
tions had revealed, looked hid- 
eous on every other member of 
the WOMS. To a woman, they 
called it / “the Sonnet Bonnet.” 
There had been the additional in- 
formation that the general her- 
self was referred to by under- 
lings as “Sinister Finnister” — 
partly because of the swirling 
cape.) 

On Battlemont’s left sat Gen- 
eral Nathan Owling of the Space 
Engineers. Better known as 
“Howling Owling” because of "a 
characteristic evidenced when he 
became angry. He appeared to 
have been shaped in the officer 
caste’s current mold of lean, 
blond athlete. The blue eyes re- 
minded Battlemont of Gwen’s 


eyes, except that the man’s ap- 
peared colder. 

If that were possible. 

Beyond Owling sat Leo Prim, 
the agency’s art director. He was 
a thin young man, thin to a point 
that vibrated across the edge of 
emaciation. His black hair, worn 
long, held a natural wave. He 
had a narrow Roman nose, soul- 
ful brown eyes, strong cleft in 
the chin, generous mouth with 
large lips. A mood-cig dangled 
from the lips. 

If Battlemont could have 
chosen his own appearance, he 
would have liked to look like 
Leo Prim. Romantic. Battlemont 
caught Prim’s attention, ventured 
a smile of cameraderie. 

No response. 

General Sonnet Finnister tap- 
ped a thin finger on the tabletop. 
It sounded to Battlemont like the 
slack drum of a- death march. 

“Hadn’t we better get started?” 
demanded Finnister. 

“Are we all here — finally?” 
asked Owling. 

Battlemont swallowed past a 
lump in his throat. “Well ... ah 
. no . ah . .” 

Owling opened a briefcase in 
his lap, glanced at an intelligence 
report, looked around the table. 
“Miss Everest is missing,” he an- 
nounced. 

Finnister said: “Couldn’t we go 
ahead without her?” 

“We’ll wait,” said Owling. He 


A-W-F UNLIMITED 


141 


was enjoying himself. Damned 
parasites need a touch of the 
whip now and then! he thought. 
Shows ’em where they stand. 

F INNISTER glared at Owling, 
a hawk stare that had re- 
duced full colonels (male) to 
trembling. The stare rolled off 
Owling without effect. Trust the 
high command to pair me with 
a male supremacy type like Owl- 
ing! she thought. 

“Is this place safe from snoop- 
ing?” asked Owling. 

Battlemont turned his own 
low-wattage glare on the staff 
seated in the mood smoke haze 
around the table. No glance met 
his. “That’s all anybody ever does 
around here!” he snapped. 

“What?” Owling started to rise. 
“Busybodies!” blared Battle- 
mont. “My whole staff!” 

“Ohhh.” Owling sank back in- 
to his chair. “I meant a different 
kind of snooping.” 

“Oh, that.” Battlemont shrug- 
ged, suppressed an urge to glance 
up at the conference room’s con- 
cealed recorder lenses. “We can- 
not have our ideas pirated by 
other agencies, you know. Ab- 
solutely safe here.” 

Gwen Everest chose this mo- 
ment for her entrance. All eyes 
followed her as she came through 
the end door, strode down the 
length of the room. 

Battlemont admired her grace. 


Such a feminine woman in spite 
of her strength. So different from 
the female general. 

Gwen found a spare chair 
against the side wall, crowded it 
in between Battlemont and Fin- 
nister. 

The commander of the WOMS 
glared at the intruder. “Who are 
you?” 

Battlemont leaned forward. 
“This is Miss Everest, our . 
ah . .” He hesitated, confused. 
Gwen had never had an official 
title with the agency. Never 
needed it. Everyone in the place 
knew she was the boss. “Ahh . 
Miss Everest is our . ah . 
director of coordination,” said 
Battlemont. 

“Why! That’s a wonderful 
title!” said Gwen. “I must get it 
printed on my stationery.” She 
patted Battlemont’s hand, faced 
him and, in her best undercover- 
agent-going-into-action voice, 
said: “Let’s have it, Chief. Who 
are these people? What’s going 
on?” 

General Owling nodded to 
Gwen. “I’m Owling, General, 
Space Engineers.” He gestured 
to the rocket splash insignia on 
his shoulder. “My companion is 
General Finnister, WOMS.” 

Gwen had recognized the fa- 
mous Finnister face. She smiled 
brightly, said: “General Woms!” 

“Finnister!” snapped the fe- 
male general.

“Yes, of course,” said Gwen. 
“General Finnister Woms. Must 
not go too informal, you know.” 

Finnister spoke in slow ca- 
dence: “I . am . General . 
Sonnet . Finnister . of . 
the . Women . of . Space! 
The WOMS!” 

“Oh, how stupid of me,” said 
Gwen. “Of course you are.” She 
patted the general’s hand, smiled 
at Battlemont. 

Battlemont, who well knew the 
falsity of this mood in Gwen 
Everest, was trying to scrunch 
down out of sight in his chair. 

In that moment, Gwen realized 
with a twinge of fear that she 
had reached a psychic point of 
no return. Something slipped a 
cog in her mind. She glanced 
around the table. Familiar faces 
leaped at her with unreal clarity. 
Staring eyes. (The best part of 
a conference was to watch Gwen 
in action.) I can’t take any more 
of this, thought Gwen. I have to 
declare myself. 

She focused on the military. 
The rest of the people in this 
room owned little pieces of her, 
but not these two. Owling and 
Finnister. Space generals. Sym- 
bols. Targets! 

Let the chips fall where they 
may! Fire when ready, Gridley. 
Shoot if you must this old gray 
head . Wait until you see the 
whites of their eyes. 

Gwen nodded to herself. 


One misstep and the agency 
was ruined. 

Who cares? 

It all passed in a split second, 
but the decision was made. 

Rebellion! 

/"''WEN turned her attention on 
^ Owling. “Would you be kind 
enough to end this stalling 
around and get the meeting un- 
der way?” 

“Stall . .” Owling broke it 
off. The intelligence report had 
said Gwen Everest was fond of 
shock tactics. He gave her a curt 
nod, passed the nod to Finnister. 

The female general addressed 
Battlemont. “Your agency, as we 
explained to you earlier, has been 
chosen for a vital task, Mr. Bat- 
tlefield.” 

“Battlemont,” said Gwen. 

Finnister stopped short. 
“What?” 

“His name is Battlemont, not 
Battle/?e/d,” said Gwen. 

“What of it?” 

“Names are important,” said 
Gwen. “I’m sure you appreciate 
this.” 

The Finnister cheeks flushed. 
“Quite!” 

Owling stepped into the 
breach. “We are authorized to 
pay this agency double the usual 
fee for performance,” he said. 
“However, if you fail us we’ll 
draft every male employee here 
into the Space Service!”

“What an asinine idea!” said 
Gwen. “Our people would de- 
stroy the Space Service. From 
within.” Again she smiled at Bat- 
tlemont. “Andre here could do 
it all by himself. Couldn’t you, 
ducky?” She patted Battlemont’s 
cheek. 

Battlemont tried to crouch 
farther down into the chair. He 
avoided the eyes of the space 
brass, said: “Gwen . please . .” 

“What do you mean, destroy 
the Space Service?” demanded 
Finnister. 

Gwen ignored her, addressed 
Owling. “This is another one of 
the Psych Branch’s brainstorms,” 
she said. “I can smell the stench 
of ’em in every word.” 

Owling frowned. As a matter 
of fact, he had the practical 
builder’s suspicion of everything 
subjective. This Kverest woman 
made a good point there. But the 
military had to stand shoulder 
to shoulder against outsiders. He 
said: “I don’t believe you are 
properly equipped to fathom mil- 
itary tactics. Let’s get on to the 
problem we . 

“Military tactics yet!” Gwen 
rapped the table. “Deploy your 
forces, men. This is it! Synchro- 
nize your watches. Over the top!” 

“Gwen!” said Battlemont. 

“Of course,” said Gwen. She 
faced Finnister. “Would you 
mind awfully outlining your 
problem in simple terms that our 


unmilitarized minds could under- 
stand?” 

A pause, a glare. Finnister 
spewed her words through stiff 
lips. “Enlistments in the WOMS 
have fallen to an alarming de- 
gree. You are going to correct 
this.” 

Behind Gwen, Battlemont 
nodded vigorously. 

“Women can release men for 
the more strenuous tasks,” said 
Owling. 

“And there are many things 
women can do that men cannot 
do,” said Finnister. 

“Absolutely essential,” said 
Owling. 

“Absolutely,” agreed Finnister. 

“Can’t draft women, I suppose,” 
said Gwen. 

“Tried to get a bill through,” 
said Owling. “Damned commit- 
tee’s headed by an anti-military 
woman.” 

“Good for her,” said Gwen. 

“You do not sound like the 
person for this job,” said Owling. 
“Perhaps . .” 

“Oh, simmer down,” said Gwen. 

“Miss Everest is the best in 
the business,” said Battlemont. 

Gwen said: “Why are enlist- 
ments down? You’ve run the 
usual surveys, I suppose.” 

“It’s the space armor,” said 
Finnister. “Women don’t like it.” 

“Too mechanical,” said Owling. 
“Too practical.” 

“We need . ah . glamor,” 


144 


GALAXY 


said Finnister. She adjusted the 
brim of her cap. 

Gwen frowned at the cap, cast 
a glance up and down the Fin- 
nister uniform. “I’ve seen the 
usual news pictures of the 
armor,” she said. “What do they 
wear underneath it? Something 
like your uniform?” 

Finnister suppressed a surge of 
anger. “No. They wear special 
fatigues.” 

“The armor cannot be re- 
moved while they are in space,” 
said Owling. 

“Oh?” said Gwen. “What about 
physical functions, that sort of 
thing?” 

“Armor takes care of every- 
thing,” said Owling. 

“Apparently not quite every- 
thing,” murmured Gwen. She 
nodded to herself, mulling tactics. 

TJATTLEMONT straightened, 
aj sniffed the atmosphere of the 
conference room. Staff all alert, 
quiet, attentive. Mood had light- 
ened somewhat. Gwen appeared 
to be taking over. Good old 
Gwen. Wonderful Gwen. No tell- 
ing what she was up to. As usual. 
She’d solve this thing, though. 
Always did. Unless . 

He blinked. Could she be toy- 
ing with them? He tried to imag- 
ine Gwen’s thought patterns. Im- 
possible. IBMausoleum couldn’t 
even do it. Unpredictable. All 
Battlemont could be certain of 


was that Gwen would get a gi- 
gantic belly laugh from the pic- 
ture of the agency’s male staff 
members drafted, slaving away 
on space freighters. 

Battlemont trembled. 

General Finnister was saying: 
“The problem is not one of get- 
ting women to enlist for Earth- 
based service. We need them in 
the ships, the asteroid stations, 
the . .” 

“Let’s get this straight,” said 
Gwen. “My great-great-grand- 
mother was in some kind of 
armed service. I read her diary 
once. She called it the ‘whackies’ 
or something like that.” 

“WACS,” said Finnister. 

“Yes,” said Gwen. “It was dur- 
ing the war with Spain.” 

“Japan,” said Owling. 

“What I’m driving at is, why 
all the sudden interest in women? 
My great-great-grandmother had 
one merry old time running away 
from some colonel who wanted 
. Well, you know. Is this some 
kind of a dodge to provide 
women for your space colonels?” 

Finnister scowled her blackest. 

Quickly suppressed chuckles 
sounded around the table. 

Owling decided to try a new 
tack. “My dear lady, our motives 
'are of the highest. We need the 
abilities of women so that man- 
kind can march side by side to 
the stars.” 

Gwen stared at him in open

admiration. “Go-wan!” she said. 

“I mean it,” said Owling. 

“You’re a poet!” said Gwen. 
“Oh . and I’ve wronged you. 
Here I was — dirty-minded me 
— thinking you wanted women 
for base purposes. And all the 
time you wanted companions. 
Someone to share this glorious 
new adventure.” 

Again, Battlemont recognized 
the danger signals. He tried to 
squeeze himself into as small a 
target as possible. Most of the 
staff around the table saw the 
same signals, but they were in- 
tent, fascinated. 

“Exactly!” boomed Finnister. 

Gwen’s voice erupted in an 
angry snarl: “And we name all 
the little bastards after the stars 
in Virgo, ehhh?” 

It took a long moment for Fin- 
nister and Owling to see that 
they had been gulled. Finnister 
started to rise. 

“Siddown!” barked Gwen. She 
grinned. She was having a magni- 
ficent time. Rebellion carried a 
sense of euphoria. 

Owling opened his mouth, 
closed it without a howl. 

Finnister sank back into her 
chair. 

“Shall we get down to busi- 
ness?” snapped Gwen. “Let’s look 
at this glorified hunk of tin you 
want us to glamorize.” 

Finnister found something she 
could focus her shocked attention 


on. “Space armor is mostly plas- 
tic, not tin.” 

“Plastic-schmastic,” said Gwen. 
“I want to see your Iron Gertie.” 
General Owling took two deep 
breaths to calm his nerves, snap- 
ped open the briefcase, extracted 
a folder of design sketches. He 
pushed them toward Gwen — a 
hesitant motion as though he 
feared she might take his hand 
with them. He now recognized 
that the incredible intelligence 
report was correct: this astonish- 
ing female was the actual head 
of the agency. 

“Here’s — Iron Gertie,” he 
said, and forced a chuckle. 

Gwen leafed through the fold- 
er while the others watched. 

Battlemont stared at her. He 
realized something the rest of 
the staff did not: Gwen Everest 
was not being the usual Gwen 
Everest. There was a subtle dif- 
ference. An abandon. Something 
was very wrong! 

WITHOUT looking up from 
™ the drawings, Gwen ad- 
dressed herself to Finnister. 
“That uniform you’re wearing, 
General Finnister. You design 
that yourself?” 

“What? Oh, yes. I did.” 
Battlemont trembled. 

Gwen reached out, rapped one 
of Finnister’s hips. “Bony,” she 
said. She turned a page in the 
folder, shook her head. 


146 


GALAXY 


“Well!” exploded Finister. 

Still without looking up, Gwen 
said: “Simmer down. How about 
the hat? You design that, too?” 

“Yesss!” It was a sibilant ex- 
plosion. 

Gwen lifted her attention to 
the hat, spoke in a reasonable 
tone: “Possibly the most hideous 
thing I’ve ever seen.” 

“Well of all the — ” 

“Are you a fashion designer?” 
asked Gwen politely. 

Finnister shook her head as 
though to clear it of cobwebs. 

“You are not a fashion design- 
er?” pressed Gwen. 

Finnister bit the words off. “I 
have had some experience in 
choosing — ” 

“The answer is no, then,” said 
Gwen. “Thought so.” She brought 
her attention back to the folder, 
turned a page. 

Finnister glared at her in 
open-mouthed rage. 

Gwen glanced up at Owling. 
“Why’d you put the finger on 
this agency?” 

Owling appeared to have 
trouble focusing his attention on 
Gwen’s question. Presently, he 
said: “You were ... it was 
pointed out that this agency was 
one of the most successful in . 
if not the most successful . 

“We were classified as experts, 
eh?” 

“Yes. If you want to put it 
that way.” 


“I want to put it that way.” 
She glanced at Finnister. “So we 
let the experts do the designing, 
is that clear? You people keep 
your greasy fingers off. Under- 
stood?” She shot a hard stare at 
Owling, back to Finnister. 

“I don’t know about you!” Fin- 
nister snapped at Owling, “but 
I’ve had all — ” 

“If you value your military 
career you’ll just sit down and 
listen,” said Gwen. Again, she 
glared at Owling. “Do you under- 
stand?” 

Owling shook his head from 
side to side. Amazement domina- 
ted him. Abruptly, he realized 
that his head shaking could be 
interpreted as negative. He bob- 
bed his head up and down, de- 
cided in mid-motion that this was 
undignified. He stopped, cleared 
his throat. 

What an astonishing female! 
he thought. 

Gwen pushed the folder of 
design sketches uptable to Leo 
Prim, the art director. “Tell me, 
General Owling,” she said, “why 
is the armor so bulky?” 

Leo Prim, who had opened the 
folder, began to chuckle. 

“Marvelous, isn’t it?” said 
Gwen. 

Someone farther uptable 
asked: “What is?” 

Gwen kept her attention on 
Owling. “Some jassack engineer 
in the Space Service designed a 


A-W-F UNLIMITED 


147 



test model suit of armor like a 
gigantic woman — breasts and 
all.” She glanced at Finnister. 
“You ran a survey on the stupid 
thing, of course?” 

Finnister nodded. She was 
shocked speechless. 

“I could’ve saved you the 
trouble,” said Gwen. “One of the 
reasons you’d better listen care- 
fully to what expert me has to 
say. No woman in her right mind 
would get into that thing. She’d 
feel big — and she’d feel naked.” 
Gwen shook her head. “Freud! 
What a combination!” 

Owling wet his lips with his 
tongue. “Ah, the armor has to 
provide sufficient shielding 
against radiation, and it must re- 
main articulate under extremes 
of pressure and temperature,” he 
said. “It can’t be made any small- 
er and still permit a human 
being to fit into it. 

“Okay,” said Gwen. “I have the 
beginnings of an idea.” 

She closed her eyes, thought: 
These military jerks are a couple 
of sitting ducks. Almost a shame 
to pot them. She opened her eyes, 
glanced at Battlemont. His eyes 
were closed. He appeared to be 
praying. Could be the ruination 
of poor Andre and his lovely 
people, too, she thought. What a 
marvelous collection of profes- 
sional stranglers! Well, can’t be 
helped. When Gwen Everest goes 
out, she goes out in a blaze of 


glory! All flags flying! Full speed 
ahead! Damn the torpedoes! 

“Well?” said Owling. 

Fire one! thought Gwen. She 
said: “Presumably, you have spe- 
cialists, experts who can advise 
us on technical details.” 

“At your beck and call when- 
ever you say the word,” said 
Owling. 

T) ATTLEMONT opened his 
eyes, stared at the back of 
Gwen’s neck. A ray of hope stab- 
bed through his panic. Was it 
possible that Gwen was really 
taking over? 

“I’ll also want all the dope on 
which psychological types make 
the best WOMS,” said Gwen. “If 
there is such a thing as a best 
WOM.” 

Battlemont closed his eyes, 
shuddered. 

“I don’t believe I’ve ever been 
treated this high-handedly in my 
entire career!” blurted Finnister. 
“I’m not entirely sure that — ” 

“Just a moment, please,” said 
Owling. He studied Gwen, who 
was smiling at him. The intelli- 
gence report said this woman was 
“probable genius” and should be 
handled delicately. 

“I’m only sorry the law doesn’t 
give us the right to draft women, 
too!” barked Finnister. 

“Then you wouldn’t really 
have this problem, would you?” 
asked Gwen. She turned her

smile on Finnister. It was full of 
beatitudes. 

Owling said: “I know we have 
full authority to handle this at 
our own discretion, General Fin- 
nister, and I agree that we’ve ■ 
been subjected to some abuse 
but. 

“Abuse!” Finnister said. 

“And high time, too,” said 
Gwen. 

A violent shudder passed 
through Battlemont. He thought: 
We are doomed! 

“However,” said Owling, “we 
mustn’t let our personal feelings 
cloud a decision for the good of 
the service.” 

“I hear the bugles blowing,” 
murmured Gwen. 

“This agency was chosen as 
the one most likely to solve the 
problem,” said Owling. 

“There could have been a mis- 
take!” said Finnister. 

“Not likely.” 

“You are determined to turn 
this thing over to . to . .” 
Finnister broke off, tapped her 
palms on the table top. 

“It’s advisable,” said Owling. 
He thought: This Gwen Everest 
will solve our problem. No prob- 
lem could resist her. No problem 
would dare! 

General Owling had become a 
Gwenophile. 

“Very well, then,” snarled Fin- 
nister. “I will reserve my judg- 
ment.” 


General Finnister had become 
a Gwenophobe. 

Which was part of Gwen Ever- 
est’s program. 

“I presume you two will be 
available for technical consulta- 
tions from time to time,” said 
Gwen. 

“Our subordinates take care of 
details,” said Owling. “All Gen- 
eral Finnister and I are interested 
in is the big picture, the key to 
the puzzle.” 

“Big picture, key to puzzle,” 
mused Gwen. “Wonderful idea.” 

“What?” Owling stared at 
her, puzzled. 

“Nothing,” said Gwen. “Just 
thinking out loud.” 

Owling stood up, looked at 
Finnister. “Shall we be going?” 

Finnister also stood up, turned 
toward the door at the end of 
the room. “Yesss!” 

Together, one on each side of 
the table, they' marched the 
length of the room: tump-a- 

thump - a - tump - a - thump - a - tump 
. Just as they reached the door 
and Owling opened it, Gwen 
jumped to her feet. “Charrrrge!” 
she shouted. 

The two officers froze, almost 
turned, thought better of it. They 
left, slamming the door. 

Battlemont spoke plaintively 
into the silence. “Gwen, why do 
you destroy us?” 

“Destroy you? Don’t be silly!” 

“But, Gwen . .”

“Please be quiet, Andre; you’re 
interrupting my train of thought.” 
She turned to Leo Prim. “Leo, 
take those sketches and things of 
that big-breasted Bertha they de- 
signed. I want adecal workups 
on them, full projos, the entire 
campaign outlay.” 

“Big Bertha adecals, projos, 
the outlay,” said Prim. “Right!” 
“Gwen, what are you doing?” 
asked Battlemont. “You said 
yourself that — ” 

“You’re babbling, Andre,” said 
Gwen. She glanced up at the ceil- 
ing. An eye in one of the Cellini 
cupids winked at her. “We got 
the usual solid recordings of this 
conference, I presume?” 

“Of course,” said Battlemont. 
“Take those recordings, Leo,” 
said Gwen. “Do a sequence out 
of them featuring only General 
Sinister Sonnet Bonnet Finnis- 
ter.” 

“What’d you call her?” asked 
Prim. 

Z'" 1 WEN explained about the 
Finnister nicknames. “The 
fashion trade knows all about 
her,” she finished. “A living hor- 
ror.” 

“Yeah, okay,” said Prim. “A 
solid sequence of nothing but 
Finnister. What do you want it 
to show?” 

“Every angle of that uniform,” 
said Gwen. “And the hat. Freud! 
Don’t forget that hat!” 


Battlemont spoke plaintively. 
“I don’t understand.” 

“Good,” said Gwen. “Leo, send 
me Restivo and Jim Spark . 
a couple more of your best de- 
sign people. Include yourself. 
We’ll . .” 

“And, lo! Ben Adam’s name 
led all the rest,” said Battlemont. 

Gwen turned, stared down at 
him. For one of the rare times 
in their association, Battlemont 
had surprised her with something 
he said. 

I wonder if our dear Andre 
could be human? she mused. No! 
I must be going soft in the head. 
She said: “Andre, go take a medi- 
tation break until time to call 
our next conference. Eh? There’s 
a good fellow.” 

Always before when she abused 
me it was like a joke between us, 
thought Battlemont dolefully. 
But now she is trying to hurt. 
His concern now was for Gwen, 
not for the agency. My Gwen 
needs help. And I don’t know 
what to do. 

“Meditation break time,” said 
Gwen. “Or you could go to a 
mood bar. Why don’t you try 
the new Interdorma mediniche? 
A niche in time saves the mind!” 

“I prefer to remain awake for 
our last hours together,” said Bat- 
tlemont. A sob clutched at his 
throat. He stood up to cover the 
moment, drew himself to atten- 
tion, fixed Gwen with a despair-

ing glare. “I feel the future 
crouching over us like a great 
beast!” He turned his back on 
her, strode out through his pri- 
vate door. 

“I wonder what the devil he 
meant by that?” mused Gwen. 

Prim said: “This is the month 
of St. Freud. They go for pre- 
science, extrasensory perception, 
that sort of thing.” 

“Oh, certainly,” she said. “I 
wrote the brochure.” But she 
found herself disturbed by Bat- 
tlemont’s departure. He looked 
so pitiful, she thought. What if 
this little caper backfires and he 
gets drafted? It could happen. 
Leo and the rest of these stran- 
glers could take it. But Andre -. 
She gave a mental shrug. T oo 
late to turn back now. 

Department heads began press- 
ing toward Gwen along the table. 
“Say, Gwen, what about the pro- 
duction on . “If I’m going to 
meet any deadlines I’ll need 
more . .’’ “Will we have to drop 
our other . .” 

“Shaddup!” bellowed Gwen. 

She smiled sweetly into the 
shocked silence. “I will meet with 
each of you privately, just as 
soon as I get in a fresh stock of 
crying towels. First things first, 
though. Number one problem: we 
get the monkey off our backs. 
Eh?” 

And she thought: You poor 
oafs! You aren’t even aware how 


close you are to disaster. You 
think Gwen is taking over as 
usual. But Gwen doesn’t care. 
Gwen doesn’t give a damn any 
more. Gwen is resigning in a blaze 
of glory! Into the valley of death 
rode the 600! Or was it 400? No 
matter. War is hell! I only regret 
that I have but one life to give 
for my agency. Give me liberty 
or give me to the WO MS. 

Leo Prim said: “You’re going 
for the throat on these two mili- 
tary types, is that it?” 

“Military tactics,” said Gwen. 
“No survivors! Take no prisoners! 
Death to the White Eyes!” 
“Huh?” said Prim. 

“Get right on that assignment 
I gave you,” she said. 

“Uhh . .” Prim looked down at 
the folder Owling had left. 
“Workups on this Big Bertha 
thing' ... a solido on Finnister. 
Okay.” He shook his head. “You 
know, this business could shape 
up into a Complete Flap.” 

“It could be worse than that,” 
Gwen cautioned. 

Someone else said: “It’s abso- 
lutely the worst I’ve ever seen. 
Drafted!” 

And Gwen thought: Ooooh! 

Someone has trepidations! Ab- 
ruptly, she said: “Absolutely 

worst flap.” She brightened. 
“That’s wonderful! One moment, 
all you lovely people.” 

There was sudden stillness in 
the preparations for departure.

“It has been moved that we 
label this business the Absolutely 
Worst Flap,” she said. 

Chuckles from the staff. 

“You will note,” said Gwen, 
“that the initials A-W-F are the 
first three letters in the word 
awful.” 

Laughter. 

“Up to now,” said Gwen, “we’ve 
only had to contend with Minor, 
Medium and Complete Flaps. 
Now I give you the AWF! It 
rhymes with the grunt of some- 
one being slugged in the stom- 
ach!” 

Into the laughter that filled 
the room, Prim said: “How about 
the U and L in awful? Can’t let 
them go to waste.” 

“Un Limited?’ snapped Gwen. 
“Absolutely Worst Flap UnLim- 
ited!” She began to laugh, had 
to choke it off as the laughter 
edged into hysteria. Whatinell’s 
wrong with me? she wondered. 
She glared at Prim. “Let’s get 
cracking, men! Isn’t a damn one 
of you would look good in uni- 
form.” 

The laughter shaded down in- 
to nervous gutterings. “That 
Gwen!” 

Gwen had to get out of there. 
It was like a feeling of nausea. 
She pushed her way down the 
side of the room. The sparkle had 
gone out of her rebellion. She 
felt that all of these people were 
pulling at her, taking bits of her- 


self that she could never recap- 
ture. It made her angry. She 
wanted to kick, bite, claw. In- 
stead, she smiled fixedly. “Ex- 
cuse me. May I get through here? 
Sorry. Thank you. Excuse me.” 

And an image of Andre Battle- 
mont kept intruding on her con- 
sciousness. Such a pitiful little 
fellow. So . well . sweet. 
Dammit! Sweet! In a despicable 
sort of way. 

rpWENTY-FIVE days slipped 
off the calendar. Twenty-five 
days of splashing in a pool of 
confusion. Gwen’s element. She 
hurled herself into the problem. 
This one had to be just right. A 
tagline for her exit. A Gwen Ev- 
erest signature at the bottom of 
the page. 

Technical experts from the 
military swarmed all through the 
agency. Experts on suit articula- 
tion. Experts on- shielding. Pres- 
sure coefficients. Artificial atmo- 
sphere. Waste reclamation. Sub- 
miniature power elements. A 
locksmith. An expert on the new 
mutable plastics. (He had to be 
flown in from the West Coast.) 

Plus the fashion experts seen 
only by Gwen. 

It was quite a job making sure 
that each military expert saw 
only what his small technical 
world required. 

Came the day of the Big Pic- 
ture. The very morning.

Adjacent to her office Gwen 
maintained a special room about 
20 feet square. She called it “my 
intimidation room.” It was al- 
most Louis XV: insubstantial 

chairs, teetery little tables, glass 
gimcracks on the light fixtures, 
pastel cherubs on the wall panels. 

The chairs looked as though 
they might smash flat under the 
weight of a medium-sized man. 
Each (with the exception of a 
padded throne chair that slid 
from behind a wall panel for 
Gwen) had a seat that canted 
forward. The sitters kept sliding 
off, gently, imperceptibly. 

None of the tables had a top 
large enough for a note pad and 
an ashtray. One of these items 
had to be balanced in the lap 
or placed underfoot. That forced 
an occasional look at the carpet. 

The carpet had been produced 
with alarming psychological trig- 
gers. The uninitiated felt that 
they were standing upside down 
in a fishbowl. 

General Owling occupied one 
of the trick chairs. He tried to 
keep from staring at the cherub 
centered in a wall panel directly 
across from him, slightly to the 
right of the seated figure of Andre 
Battlemont. Battlemont looked 
ill. Owling pushed himself back- 
ward in the chair. His knees felt 
exposed. He glanced at General 
Finnister. She sat to his right 
beyond a spindly table. She 


pulled her skirt down as he 
watched. He wondered why she 
sat so far forward on the chair. 

Damned uncomfortable little 
chairs! 

He noted that Battlemont had 
brought in one of the big con- 
ference room chairs for himself. 
Owling wondered why they all 
couldn’t have those big, square, 
solid, secure chairs. For that mat- 
ter, why wasn’t this meeting be- 
ing held in the big conference 
room? Full staff. The Big Pic- 
ture! He glanced up at the wall 
panel opposite. Stupid damned 
cherub! He looked down at the 
rug, grimaced, tore his gaze away. 

Finnister had looked at the 
rug when she came into the room, 
had almost lost her balance. Now, 
she tried to keep her attention off 
it. Her mind seethed with dis- 
quieting rumors. Individual re- 
ports from the technical experts 
failed to reveal a total image. It 
was like a jigsaw puzzle with 
pieces from separate puzzles all 
thrown together. She pushed her- 
self backward in the chair. What 
an uncomfortable room. Intuition 
told her the place was subtly de- 
liberate. Her latent anger at 
Gwen Everest flared. Where is 
that woman? 

Battlemont cleared his throat, 
glanced at the door to his right 
through which Gwen was expec- 
ted momentarily. Must she al- 
ways be late? Gwen had avoided

him for weeks. Too busy. Sud- 
denly this morning she had to 
have Andre Battlemont front and 
center. A figurehead. A prop for 
her little show. He knew pretty 
much what she was doing, too. 
In the outward, physical sense. 
She might be able to keep things 
from some of the people around 
here, but Andre Battlemont ran 
his own intelligence system. As 
to what was going on in her mind, 
though, he couldn’t be sure. All 
he knew was that it didn’t fit. 
Not even for Gwen. 

Finnister said: “Our technical 
people inform us that you’ve 
been pretty interested — ” she 
pushed herself back in the chair 
— “in the characteristics of some 
of the newer mutable plastics.” 

“That is true,” said Battlemont. 

“Why?” asked Owling. 

“Ahhh, perhaps we’d better 
wait for Miss Everest,” said Bat- 
tlemont. “She is bringing a solido 
projector.” 

“You have mockups already?” 
asked Owling. 

“Yes.” 

“Good! How many models?” 

“One. Our receptionist. Beauti- 
ful girl.” 

“What?” Finnister and Owling 
in unison. 

“Oh! You mean . that is, we 
have the one to show you. It 
is really two . but only one of 
. .” He shrugged, suppressed a 
shudder. 


Finnister and Owling looked 
at each other. 


TJATTLEMONT closed his 
eyes. Gwen, please hurry. He 
thought about her solution to the 
military problem, began to trem- 
ble. Her basic idea was sound, of 
course. Good psychological roots. 
But the military would never go 
for it. Especially that female gen- 
eral who walked like a sergeant. 
Battlemont’s eyes snapped open 
as he heard a door open. 

Gwen came in pushing a port- 
able display projector. A glance 
of mutual dislike passed between 
Gwen and Finnister, was masked 
by mutual bright smiles immedi- 
ately. 


“Good morning, everybody,” 
chirped Gwen. 

Danger signal! thought Battle- 
mont. She’s mad! She’s . He 
stopped the thought, focused on 
it. Maybe she is. We work her 
so hard. 

“Anxious to see what you have 
there,” said Owling. “Just getting 
ready to ask for a progress report 
when you called this meeting.” 

“We wanted to have something 
first that you could appreciate as 
an engineer,” said Gwen. 

Owling nodded. 

Finnister said: “Our people re- 
port that you’ve been very secre- 
tive about your work. Why?” 

“The very walls have ears. 
Loose lips lose the Peace! Don’t

be half safe!” Gwen positioned 
the projector in the center of 
the room, took the remote con- 
trol, crossed to a panel which 
swung out to disgorge her chair. 
She sat down facing Finnister 
and Owling. 

Seconds dragged past while 
she stared in fascination at Fin- 
nister’s knees. 

“Gwen?” said Battlemont. 

Finnister tugged down on the 
hem of her skirt. 

“What do you have to show 
us?” demanded Owling. He 
pushed himself back in the chair. 

“First,” said Gwen, “let us ex- 
amine the perimeters of the prob- 
lem. You must ask yourself: What 
do young women want when they 
enter the service?” 

“Sounds sensible,” said Owl- 
ing. 

Finnister nodded, her dislike 
of Gwen submerged in attention 
to the words. 

“They want several things,” 
said Gwen. “They want travel 
. adventure . the knight 
errant sort of thing. Tally-ho!” 

Battlemont, Finnister and Owl- 
ing snapped to shocked attention. 

“Gives you pause when you 
think about it,” murmured Gwen. 
“All those women looking for 
something. Looking for the free 
ride. The brass ring. The pot at 
the end of the rainbow.” 

She had them nodding again, 
Gwen noted. She raised her voice: 


“The old carrousel! The jingle- 
dingle joy journey!” 

Battlemont looked at her sad- 
ly. Mad. Ohhh, my poor, poor 
Gwenny. 

Owling said: “I . uh . .” 
“But they all want one com- 
modity!” snapped Gwen. “And 
what’s that? Romance! That’s 
what’s that. And in the uncon- 
scious mind what’s that romance? 
That romance is sex!” 

“I believe I’ve heard enough,” 
said Finnister. 

“No,” said Owling. “Let’s . 
uh . this is all, I’m sure, pre- 
liminary. I want to know where 
. after all, the model . 
models they’ve developed . .” 
“What’s with sex when you get 
all the folderol off it?” demanded 
Gwen. “The psychological roots. 
What’s down there?” 

Owling scratched his throat, 
stared at her. He had a basic 
distrust of subjective ideas, but 
he always came smack up against 
the fear that maybe (just maybe 
now) they were correct. Some of 
them appeared (and it could be 
appearance only ) to work. 

“I’ll tell you what’s down 
there,” muttered Gwen. “Mother- 
hood. Home. Security with a 
man. The flag.” 

Owling thought: It all sounds 
so sensible . except . 

“And what does your armor 
do?” asked Gwen. “Armor equals 
no amour! They’re locked up in 


156 


GALAXY 


desexed chunks of metal and 
plastic where no men can g'et 
at them. Great Freud! Men can’t 
even see them in there!” 

“Women don’t really want men 
to get at them!” barked Finnister. 
“Of all the disgusting ideas I’ve 
ever — ” 

“Just a minute!” said Gwen. “A 
normal woman always wants the 
possibility. That’s what she wants. 
And she wants it under her con- 
trol. You’ve eliminated the possi- 
bility. You’ve taken all control 
out of their hands, put your 
women at the mercy of the ele- 
ments, separated from cold, mas- 
culine, angular ABRUPT AND 
FINAL DEATH! by only a thin 
layer of plastic and metal.” 
Battlemont stared at her help- 
lessly. Poor Gwen. Doomed. And 
she won’t even sell this idea. 
We’re all doomed with her. 

T^INNISTER glared at Gwen, 
still smarting under the im- 
plied dig of the word normal. 

“How do you propose to get 
around these, ah, objections?” 
asked Owling. 

“You’ll see,” said Gwen. “Let’s 
go in from the perimeter now. 
Remember, the basic female idea 
is to be able to run away with the 
assurance that she will be caught. 
She wants a certain amount of 
exposure as a female without be- 
ing too bare-ahhh-faced about it.” 
“Mmmmph!” said Finnister. 

A-W-F UNLIMITED 


Gwen smiled at her. 

Gwen is deliberately destroy- 
ing herself and us with her, 
thought Battlemont. 

“Do you see what is lacking?” 
asked Gwen. 

“Hmmmm-ahhhhh-hmmmmm,” 
said Owling. 

“A universal symbol,” said 
Gwen. “A bold symbol. A sym- 
bol!” 

“What do you propose?” asked 
Owling. 

“That’s it!” said Gwen. “A pro- 
posal! Plus — ” she hesitated — 
“the symbol! The key is very sim- 
ple.” She sat up, perky, grinning 
at them. “In fact, it’s a key!” 

Finnister and Owling Spoke in 
unison: “A key?” 

“Yes. Two keys, actually. Sym- 
bolism’s obvious.” She produced 
two keys from her jacket pocket, 
held them up. ^‘As you can see, 
one key is hard, angular ... a 
masculine key. The other has 
fancy curves. It’s daintier, more 
the. .” 

“Do you. mean to tell me,” 
howled Owling, “that you people 
have spent all these weeks, all 
those consultations with our ex- 
perts, and come up with . with 
. with . He pointed, unable 
to continue. 

Gwen shook her head from 
side to side. “Oh, no. Remember, 
these are just symbols. They’re 
important, of course. One might 
even say they were vital. Each 

157

key will be inscribed with the 
name of the person who gets it.” 
“What are they keys to?” 
asked Finnister. She was fasci- 
nated in spite of herself. 

“To the space armor, natural- 
ly,” said Gwen. “These keys lock 
your people in their armor — 
both men and women.” 

“Lock them?” protested Fin- 
nister. “But you said . .” 

“I know,” said Gwen. “But, you 
see, a key that will lock people 
into something will also let them 
out. As a matter of fact, any one 
of these keys will open any suit. 
That’s for the safety factor.” 

“But they can’t get out of their 
suits when they’re in space!” 
howled Owling. “Of all the . .” 
“That’s right!” said Gwen. 
“They can’t really get out. So 
we give them the symbol of get- 
ting out. For exchanging.” 

“Exchanging?” asked Finnister. 
“Certainly. A male astronaut 
sees a girl astronaut he likes. He 
asks her to trade keys. Very 
romantic. Symbolic of things that 
may happen when they return to 
Earth or get to a base where they 
can get out of the suits.” 

“Miss Everest,” said Finnister, 
“as you so aptly pointed out 
earlier, no astronaut can see one 
of our women in this armor. And 
even if he could, I don’t believe 
that I’d . .” 

She froze, staring, shocked 
speechless. 


Gwen had pushed a stud on 
the solido projector’s remote con- 
trol. A suit of space armor 
appeared to be hanging in the 
center of the room. In the suit, 
wearing a form-fitting jacket, 
stood the agency’s busty recep- 
tionist. The suit of armor around 
her was transparent from the 
waist up. 

“The bottom half remains 
opaque at all times,” said Gwen. 
“For reasons of modesty . the 
connections. However, the top 
half . 

Gwen pushed another stud. 
The transparent upper half faded 
through gray to black until it 
concealed the model. 

“For privacy when desired,” 
said Gwen. “That’s how we’ve 
used the new mutable plastic. 
Gives the girl some control over 
her environment.” 

Again, Gwen pushed the first 
stud. The upper half of the model 
reappeared. 

Finnister gaped at the form- 
fitting uniform. 

Gwen stood up, took a pointer, 
gestured in through the projec- 
tion. “This uniform was designed 
by a leading couturier. It is made 
to reveal while concealing. A 
woman with only a fair figure 
will appear to good advantage 
in it. A woman with an excellent 
figure appears stunning, as you 
can see. Poor figures . — ” Gwen 
shrugged — “there are exercises 


158 


GALAXY 



for developing them. Or so I am 
told.” 

Finnister interrupted in a cold 
voice. “And what do you propose 
to do with that . that uni . 
clothing?” 

“This will be the regulation 
uniform for the WOMS,” said 
Gwen. “There’s a cute little hat 
goes with it. Very sexy.” 

Battlemont said: “Perhaps the 
changeover could be made slowly 
so as to . 

“What changeover?” demand- 
ed Finnister. She leaped to her 
feet. “General Owling?” 

Owling tore his attention from 
the model. “Yes?” 

“Completely impractical! I will 
put up with no more!” barked Fin- 
nister. 

Battlemont thought: I knew it. 
Oh, my poor Gwenny! They will 
destroy her, too. I knew it. 

“We can’t waste any more time 
with this agency,” said Finnister. 
“Come, General.” 

“Wait!” yelped Battlemont. He 
leaped to his feet. “Gwen, I told 
you . 

Finnister said: “It’s regrettable, 
but . .” 

“Perhaps we’re being a little 
hasty,” said Owling. “There may 
be something to salvage from 
this. .” 

“Yes!” said Battlemont. “Just a 
little more time is all we need to 
get a fresh . .” 

“I think not,” said Finnister. 


pWEN smiled from one to the 
other, thought: What a prize 
lot of gooney birds! She felt a 
little drunk, as euphoric as if she 
had just, come from a mood bar. 
Rebellion, it’s wonderful! Up the 
Irish! Or something. 

Owling shrugged, thought: We 
have to stand together against ci- 
vilians. General Finnister is right. 
Too bad, though. He got to his 
feet. 

“Just a little more time,” 
pleaded Battlemont. 

Too bad about Andre, thought 
Gwen. She had an inspiration, 
said: “One moment, please.” 

Three pairs of eyes focused on 
her. 

Finnister said: “If you think 
you can stop me from going 
through with our threat, dissuade 
yourself. I’m perfectly aware that 
you had that uni . that cloth- 
ing designed to make me look 
hideous!” 

“Why not?” asked Gwen. “I 
was only doing to you what you 
did to virtually every other wom- 
an in the WOMS.” 

“Gwen!” pleaded Battlemont 
in horror. 

“Be still, Andre,” said Gwen. 
“It’s just a matter of timing, any- 
way. Today. Tomorrow. Next 
week. Not really important.” 

“Oh, my poor Gwenny,” sob- 
bed Battlemont. 

“I was going to wait,” said 
Gwen. “Possibly a week. At least 


160

until I’d turned in my resigna- 
tion.” 

“What’re you talking about?” 
asked Owling. 

“Resignation!” gasped Battle- 
mont. 

“I just can’t toss poor Andre 
here to the wolves,” said Gwen. 
“The rest of our men, yes. Once 
they get inside they’ll chew your 
guts out, anyway.” 

“What are you talking about?” 
asked Finnister. 

“The rest of the men in this 
agency can take care of them- 
selves . and you, too,” said 
Gwen. “Wolves among wolves. 
But Andre here is helpless. All he 
has is his position . money. He’s 
an accident. Put him someplace 

1 where money and position are 
less important, it’ll kill him.” 
“Regrettable,” said Finnister. 
“Shall we be going, General Owl- 
ing?” 

“I was going to ruin both of 
you,” said Gwen. “But I’ll tell 
you what. You leave Andre alone 
and I’ll just give one of you the 
business.” 

“Gwen, what are you saying?” 
whispered Battlemont. 

“Yesss!” hissed Finnister. “Ex- 
plain yourself!” 

“I just want to know the peck- 
ing order here,” said Gwen. 
“Which one of you ranks the 
other?” 

“What does that have to do 
with it?” asked Finnister. 

A- W-F UNLIMITED 


“Just a minute,” said Owling. 
“That intelligence report.” He 
glared at Gwen. “I’m told you’ve 
prepared an adecal on the test 
model we made before coming 
to you.” 

“Big Bertha,” said Gwen. “And 
it’s not just an adecal. I have 
everything needed for a full na- 
tional campaign. Look!” 

A solido of the breast-bearing 
test model replaced the trans- 
parent suit hanging in the center 
of the room. 

“The idea for Big Bertha here 
originated with General Owling,” 
said Gwen. “My campaign estab- 
lishes that fact, then goes on to 
feature an animated model of 
Big Bertha. She is a living panic. 
Funniest thing you ever saw. 
General Owling, you will be the 
laughing stock of the nation by 
nightfall of the day I start this 
campaign.” 

Owling took a step forward. 

Battlemont said: “Gwen! They 
will destroy you!” 

Owling pointed at the projec- 
tion. “You . you wouldn’t!” 

“But I would,” said Gwen. She 
smiled at him. 

Battlemont tugged at Gwen’s 
arm. She shook him off. 

“It would ruin me,” whispered 
Owling. 

“Presumably, you are capable 
of going through with this threat,” 
said Finnister. “Regrettable.” 

Owling whirled on Finnister.

“We must stand together!” he said 
desperately. 

“You bet,” said Gwen. She 
pushed another stud on the re- 
mote control. 

A projection of General Fin- 
nister in her famous uniform re- 
placed Big Bertha. 

“You may as well know the 
whole story,” said Gwen. “I’m all 
set with another campaign on 
the designing of this uniform, 
right from the Sonnet Bonnet on 
down through the Sinister Fin- 
nister cape and those sneaky 
walking shoes. I start with a 
dummy model of the general 
clad in basic foundation gar- 
ments. Then I go on to show 
how each element of the present 
WOMS uniform was designed 
for the . ah . Finnister . 
ah . figure.” 

“I’ll sue!” barked Finnister. 

“Go ahead. Go ahead.” Gwen 
waved a sinuous arm. 

She acts drunk! thought Bat- 
tlemont. But she never drinks. 

“I’m all set to go black market 
with these campaigns,” said 
Gwen. “You can’t stop me. I’ll 
prove every contention I make 
about that uniform. I’ll expose 
you. I’ll show why your enlist- 
ment drives flopped.” 

T>ED suffused the Finnister 
face. “All right!” she snapped. 
“If you’re going to ruin us, I 
guess there’s nothing we can do 


about it. But mark this, Miss 
Everest. We’ll have the men of 
this agency in the service. You’ll 
have that on your conscience! 
And the men we draft will serve 
under friends of ours. I hope you 
know what that means!” 

“You don’t have any friends,” 
said Gwen, but her voice lacked 
conviction. It’s backfiring, she 
thought. Oh, hell. I didn’t think 
they’d defy me. 

“There may even be something 
we can do about you!” said Fin- 
nister. “A presidential order put- 
ting you in the service for reasons 
of national emergency. Or an 
emergency clause on some bill. 
And when we get our hands on 
you, Miss Everest . .” 

“Andre!” wailed Gwen. It was 
all getting out of hand. I didn’t 
want to hurt anybody, she 
thought. I just . She realized 
that she didn’t know what she 
had wanted. 

Battlemont was electrified. In 
22 years, Gwen Everest had 
never appealed to anyone for 
help. And now, for the first time, 
her appeal was to him! He step- 
ped between Gwen and Finnister. 
“Andre is right here,” he said. He 
felt inspired. His Gwen had ap- 
pealed to him! “You assassin!” 
he said, shaking a finger under 
the Finnister nose. 

“Now, see here!” snapped Owl- 
ing. “I won’t stand for any more 
of — •”

“And you!” barked Battlemont, 
whirling. “We have recordings of 
every conference here, from the 
first, and including this one! They 
show what happened! Don’t you 
know what is wrong with this 
poor girl? You! You’ve driven 
her out of her mind!” 

Gwen joined in the chorus: 
“What?” 

“Be still, Gwen,” said Battle- 
mont. “I will handle this.” 

Gwen couldn’t take her at- 
tention off him. Battlemont was 
magnificent. “Yes, Andre.” 

“I will prove it,” said Battle- 
mont. “With Interdorma psychi- 
atrists. With all the experts 
money can buy. You think you 
have seen something in those 
campaigns our Gwen set up? 
Hah! I will show you something.” 
He stabbed a finger at Owling. 
“Can the military drive you in- 
sane?” 

“Oh, now see here,” said Owl- 
ing. “This has gone — ” 

“Yes! It can drive you insane!” 
said Battlemont. “And we will 
show, step by step, how you 
drove our poor Gwen out of her 
mind with fear for her friends. 
Fear for me!” He slapped himself 
on the chest, glared at Finnister. 
“And you know what we will do 
next? We will say to the public: 
This could happen to you! Who 
is next? You? Or you? Or you? 
Then what happens to your 
money from Congress? What 


happens to your enlistment 
quotas?” 

“Now see here,” said Owling. 
“We didn’t . .” 

“Didn’t you?” snarled Battle- 
mont. “You think this poor girl 
is in her right mind?” 

“Well, but we didn’t . .” 
“Wait until you see our cam- 
paign,” said Battlemont. He took 
Gwen’s hand, patted it. “There, 
there, Gwenny. Andre will fix.” 
“Yes, Andre,” she said. They 
were the only words she could 
find. She felt stupified. He’s in 
love with me, she thought. Never 
before had she known anyone to 
be in love with her. 'Not even 
her parents, who had always been 
repelled by the intellect they had 
spawned. Gwen felt warmth seep- 
ing through her. A cog slipped 
into motion in her mind. It 
creaked somewhat from long idle- 
ness. She thought: He’s in love 
with me! She wanted to hug him. 

‘We seem to be at a stalemate,” 
muttered Owling. 

Finnister said: “But we can’t 
just — ” 

“Shut up!” ordered Owling. 
“He’ll do it! Can’t you see that?” 
“But if we draft — ” 

“He’ll do it for sure, then! Buy 
some other agency to run the 
campaign.” 

“But we could turn around and 
draft — ” 

“You can’t draft everybody 
who disagrees with you, woman!

“I . Finnister said helpless-

“And it’s not just us he’d ruin,” 
said Owling. “The whole service. 
He’d strike right at the money. 

I know his type. He wasn’t bluf- 
fing. It’d be catastrophic!” 

O WLING shook his head, see- 
ing a parade of crumbling 
military projects pass before his 
mind’s eye, all falling into an 
abyss labeled “NSF.” 

“You are an intelligent man, 
General Owling,” said Battle- 
mont. 

“That Psych Branch!” snarled 
Owling. “Them and their bright 
ideas!” 

“I told you they were fuzzy- 
heads,” said Gwen 

“You be still, Gwen,” said Bat- 
tlemont. 

“Yes, Andre.” 

“Well, what’re we going to do?” 
demanded Owling. 

“I tell you what,” said Battle- 
mont. “You leave us alone, we 
leave you alone.” 

“But what about my enlist- 
ments?” wailed Finnister. 

“You think our Gwen, sick or 
well, can’t solve your problems?” 
asked Battlemont. “For your en- 
listments you use the program as 
outlined.” 

“I won’t!” 

“You will,” said Owling. 


“General Owling, I refuse to 
have. .” 

“What happens if I have to 
dump this problem on the Gen- 
eral Staff?” asked Owling. “Where 
will the head-chopping start? In 
the Psych Branch? Certainly. 
Who’ll be next? The people who 
could’ve solved it in the field, 
that’s who!” 

Finnister said: “But — ■” 

“For that matter,” said Owl- 
ing, “Miss Everest’s ideas sounded 
pretty sensible . with some 
modifications, of course.” 

“No modifications,” said Bat- 
tlemont. 

He’s a veritable Napoleon! 
thought Gwen. 

“Only in minor, unimportant 
details,” soothed Owling. “For 
engineering reasons.” 

“Perhaps,” agreed Battlemont. 
“Provided we pass on the modi- 
fications before they are made.” 

“I’m sure we can work it out,” 
said Owling. 

Finnister gave up, turned her 
back on them. 

“One little detail,” murmured 
Battlemont. “When you make out 
the double-fee check to the agen- 
cy, make a substantial addition 
— bonus for Miss Everest.” 

“Naturally,” said Owling. 

“Naturally,” said Battlemont. 

When the space brass had de- 
parted, Battlemont faced Gwen, 
stamped his foot. “You have been 
very bad, Gwen!”

“But, Andre — ” 

“Resignation!” barked Battle- 
mont. 

“But — ” 

“Oh, I understand, Gwen. It’s 
my fault. I worked you much too 
hard. But that is past.” 

“Andre, you don’t — ” 

“Yes, I do! I understand. You 
were going to sink the ship and 
go down with it. My poor, dear 
Gwen. A death wish! If you’d 
only paid attention to your In- 
terdorma telelog.” 

“I didn’t want to hurt anyone 
here, Andre. Only those two — ” 
“Yes, 'y es - I know. You’re all 
mixed up.” 

“That’s true.” She felt like cry- 
ing. She hadn’t cried . since 
. she couldn’t remember when. 
“You know,” she said, “I can’t 
remember ever crying.” 

“That’s it!” said Battlemont. 
“I cry all the time. You need a 
stabilizing influence. You need 
someone to teach you how to 
cry.” 

“Would you teach me, Andre?” 
“Would I . .” He wiped the 
tears from his eyes. “You are 
going on a vacation. Immediate- 
ly! I am going with you.” 

“Yes, Andre.” 

“And when we return — ” 

“I don’t want to come back to 
the agency, Andre. I . can’t.” 
“So that’s it!” said Battlemont. 
“The advertising business! It 
bugs you!” 


S HE shrugged. “I’m ... I just 
can’t face another campaign. 
I . just . can’t.” 

“You will write a book,” an- 
nounced Battlemont. 

“What?” 

“Best therapy known,” said 
Battlemont. “Did it myself once. 
You will write about the adver- 
tising business. You will expose 
all the dirty tricks: the hypno- 
j ingles, the subvisual flicker im- 
ages, the advertisers who finance 
textbooks to get their sell into 
them, the womb rooms where 
the you-seekers are programmed. 
Everything.” 

“I could do it,” she said. 

“You will tell all,” said Bat- 
tlemont. 

“Will I!” 

“And you will do it under a 
pseudonym,” said Battlemont. 
“Safer.” 

“When do we start the vaca- 
tion, Andre?” 

“Tomorrow.” He experienced a 
moment of his old panic. “You 
don’t mind that I’m . ugly as 
a pig?” 

“You’re just beautiful,” she 
said. She smoothed the hair 
across his bald spot. “You don’t 
mind that I’m smarter than you?” 
“Ah, hah!” Battlemont drew 
himself to attention. “You may 
be smarter in the head, my dar- 
ling, but you are not smarter in 
the heart!”

W HEN Marty first saw 
the thing it was nearly 
dead ahead, half a mil- 
lion miles away, a tiny green 
blip that repeated itself every 
five seconds on the screen of his 
distant search radar. 

He was four billion miles from 
Sol and heading out, working his 
way slowly through a small 
swarm of rock chunks that 
swung in a slow sun-orbit out 
here beyond Pluto, looking for 
valuable minerals in a concentra- 
tion that would make mining 


profitable. 


It's a long way home from 
outer space — especially 
if you have to walk itl 



The thing on his radar screen 
looked quite small and therefore 
not too promising. But, as it was 
almost in his path, no great ef- 
fort would be required to inves- 
tigate. For all he knew, it might 
be solid germanium. And nothing 
better was in sight at the mo- 
ment. 

Marty leaned back in the con- 
trol seat and said: “We’ve got 
one coming up, baby.” He had 
no need to address himself any 
more exactly. Only one other 
human was aboard the Clemen- 
tine, or, to his knowledge, within 


By FRED SABERHAGEN Illustrated by IVIE 







the better part of a couple of bil- 
lion miles. 

Laura’s voice answered 
through a speaker, from the kit- 
chen two decks below. 

“Oh, close? Have we got time 
for breakfast?” 

Marty studied the radar. 
“About five hours if we main- 
tain speed. Hope it won’t be a 
waste of energy to decelerate 
and look the thing over.” He 
gave Clem’s main computer the 
problem of finding the most 
economical engine use to ap- 
proach his find and reach zero 
velocity relative to it. 

“Come and eat!” 

“All right.” He and the com- 
puter studied the blip together 
for a few seconds. Then the man, 
not considering it anything of 
particular importance, left the 
control room to have breakfast 
with his bride of three months. 
As he walked downstairs in the 
steadily-maintained artificial 
gravity, he heard the engines 
starting. 

r | ''EN hours later he examined 
his new find much more 
closely, with a rapidly focusing 
alertness that balanced between 
an explorer’s caution and a pros- 
pector’s elation at a possibly 
huge strike. 

The incredible shape of X, be- 
coming apparent as the Clem 
drew within a few hundred 


miles, was what had Marty on 
the edge of his chair. It was a 
needle thirty miles long, as 
near as his radar could measure, 
and about a hundred yards thick 
— dimensions that matched ex- 
actly nothing Marty could ex- 
pect to find anywhere in space. 

It was obviously no random 
chunk of rock. And it was no 
spaceship that he had ever seen 
or heard of. One end of it 
pointed in the direction of Sol, 
causing him to suggest to Laura 
the idea of a miniature comet, 
complete with tail. She took him 
seriously at first, then remem- 
bered some facts about comets 
and swatted him playfully. “Oh, 
you!” she said. 

Another, more real possibility 
quickly became obvious, with 
sobering effect. The ancient fear 
of the Alien that had haunted 
Earthmen through almost three 
thousand years of intermittent 
space exploration, that had never 
been realized, now peered into 
the snug control room through 
the green radar eye. 

Aliens were always good for a 
joke when spacemen met and 
talked. But they turned out to 
be not particularly amusing 
when you were possibly con- 
fronting them, several billion 
miles from Earth. Especially, 
thought Marty, in a ship built 
for robot mining, ore refining, 
and hauling, not for diplomatic 


180 


GALAXY 


contacts or heroics. And with the 
only human assistance a girl on 
her first space trip, Marty hardly 
felt up to speaking for the hu- 
man race in such a situation. 

It took a minute to set the 
autopilot so that any sudden 
move by X would trigger alarms 
and such evasive tactics as Clem 
could manage. He then set a ro- 
bot librarian to searching his mi- 
crofilm files for any reference to 
a spaceship having X’s incredible 
dimensions. 

There was a chance — how 
good a chance he found hard to 
estimate, when any explanation 
looked somewhat wild — that X 
was a derelict, the wrecked hull 
of some ship dead for a decade, 
or a century, or a thousand 
years. By laws of salvage, such 
a find would belong to him if he 
towed it into port. The value 
might be very high or very low. 
But the prospect was certainly 
intriguing. 

Marty brought Clem to a stop 
relative to X, and noticed that 
his velocity relative to Sol now 
also hung at zero. “I wonder,” 
he muttered. “Space anchor. .?” 

The space anchor had been in 
use for thousands of years. It was 
a device that enabled a ship to 
fasten itself to a particular point 
in the gravitational field of a 
massive body such as a sun. If 
X was anchored, it did not prove 
that there was still life aboard 


her; once “dropped,” an anchor 
could hold as long as a hull could 
last. 

Laura brought sandwiches and 
a hot drink to him in the control 
room. 

“If we call the Navy and they 
bring it in we won’t §et anything 
out of it,” he told her between 
bites. “That’s assuming it’s — 
not alien.” 

“Could there be someone alive 
on it?” She was staring into the 
screen. Her face was solemn but, 
he thought, not frightened. 

“If it’s human, you mean? No. 
I know there hasn’t been any 
ship remotely like that used in 
recent years. Way, way back the 
Old Empire built some that were 
even bigger, but none I ever 
heard of with this crazy 
shape . .” 

The robot librarian indicated 
that it had drawn a blank. “See?” 
said Marty. “And I’ve even got 
most of the ancient types in 
there.” 

There was silence for a little 
while. The evening’s recorded 
music started somewhere in the 
background. 

“What would you do if I 
weren’t along?” Laura asked 
him. 

He did not answer directly, 
but said something he had been 
considering. “I don’t know the 
psychology of our hypothetical 
aliens. But it seems to me that 


THE LONG WAY HOME 


181 


if you set out exploring new so- 
lar systems, you do as Earthmen 
have always done — go with the 
best you have in the way of 
speed and weapons. Therefore if 
X is alien I don’t think Clem 
would stand a chance, trying to 
fight or run.” He paused, frowned 
at the image of X. “That damned 
shape — it’s just not right for 
anything.” 

“We could call the Navy — 
not that I’m saying we should, 
darling,” she added hastily. “You 
decide, and I’ll never complain 
either way. I’m just trying to 
help you think it out.” 

He looked at her, believed it 
about there never being any com- 
plaints and squeezed her hand. 
Anything more seemed super- 
fluous. 

“If I was alone,” he said, “I’d 
jump into a suit, go look that 
thing over, haul it back to Gany- 
mede and sell it for a unique 
whatever-it-is. Maybe I’d make 
enough money to marry you in 
real style, and trade in Clem for 
a first-rate ship — or maybe even 
terraform an asteroid and keep a 
couple of robot prospectors. I 
don’t know, though. Maybe we’d 
better call the Navy.” 

She stood up and laughed at 
him gently. “We’re married 
enough already, and we had all 
the style I wanted. Besides, I 
don’t think either of us would be 
happy sitting on an asteroid very 


long. How long do you think it 
will take you to look it over?” 

At the airlock door she had 
misgivings: “Oh, it is safe enough, 
isn’t it? Marty, be careful and 
come back soon.” She kissed him 
before he closed his helmet. 

They had moved Clem to 
within a few miles of X. Marty 
mounted his spacebike and ap- 
proached it slowly, from the side. 

The vast length of X blotted 
out a thin strip of stars to his 
right and left, as if it were the 
distant shore of some vast island 
in a placid Terran sea, and the 
starclouds below him were 
watery reflections of the ones 
above. But space was too black 
to permit such an illusion to en- 
dure. 

The tiny FM radar on his bike 
showed him within three hundred 
yards of X. He killed his forward 
speed with a gentle application 
of retrojets and turned on a 
spotlight. Bright metal gleamed 
smoothly back at him as he 
swung the beam from side to 
side. Then he stopped it where 
a dark concavity showed up. 

“Lifeboat berth . empty,” 
he said aloud, looking through 
the bike’s little telescope. 

“Then it is a derelict? We’re 
all right?” asked Laura’s voice 
in his helmet. 

“Looks that way, yeah, I guess 
there’s no doubt of it. I’ll go in 
for a closer look now.” He eased 


182 


GALAXY 


the bike forward. X was evi- 
dently just some rare type of 
ship that neither he nor the com- 
pilers of the standard reference 
works in his library had ever 
heard of. Which sounded a little 
foolish to him, but . 

At ten yards distance he killed 
speed again, set the bike on 
automatic stay-clear, made sure a 
line from it was fast to his belt 
and launched himself out of the 
saddle gently, headfirst toward 
X. 

The armored hands of his suit 
touched down first, easily and ex- 
pertly. In a moment he was 
standing upright on the hull, 
held in place by magnetic boots. 
He looked around. He detected 
no response to his arrival. 

Marty turned toward Sol, 
sighting down the miles of dark 
cylinder that seemingly dwindled 
to a point in the starry distance, 
like a road on which a man might 
travel home toward a tiny sun. 

Near at hand the hull was 
smooth, looking like that of any 
ordinary spaceship. In the direc- 
tion away from Sol, quite distant, 
he could vaguely see some sort 
of projections at right angles to 
the hull. He mounted his bike 
again and set off in that direction. 
When he neared the nearest pro- 
jection, a mile down the hull, he 
saw it to be a sort of enormous 
clamp that encircled X — or 
rather, part of a clamp. It ended 


a few yards from the hull, in 
rounded globs of metal that had 
once been molten but were now 
too cold to affect the thermom- 
eter Marty held against them. 
His radiation counter showed 
nothing above the normal back- 
ground. 

“Ah,” said Marty after a mo- 
ment, looking at the half-clamp. 

“Something?” 

“I think I’ve got it figured out. 
Not quite as weird as we thought. 
Let me check for one thing 
more.” He steered the bike slow- 
ly around the circumference of 
X. 

A third of the way around he 
came upon what looked like a 
shallow trench, about five feet 
wide and a foot deep, with a bot- 
tom that shone cloudy gray in 
his lights. It ran lengthwise on X 
as far as he could see in either 
direction. 

A door-sized opening was cut 
in the clamp above the trench. 

Marty nodded and smiled to 
himself, and gunned the bike 
around in an accelerating curve 
that aimed at the Clementine. 

UTT ’s not a spaceship at all, 
only a part of one,” he told 
Laura a little later, digging in the 
microfilm film with his own 
hands, with the air of a man who 
knew what he was looking for. 
“That’s why the librarian didn’t 
turn it up. Now I remember read- 


THE .LONG WAY HOME 


183 


ing about them. It’s part of an 
Old Empire job of about two 
thousand years ago. They used 
a somewhat different drive than 
we do, one that made one enor- 
mous ship more economical to 
run than several normal sized 
ones. They made these ships 
ready for a voyage by fastening 
together a number of long nar- 
row sections side by side, how 
many depending on how much 
cargo they had to move. What 
we’ve found is obviously one of 
those sections.” 

Laura wrinkled her forehead. 
“It must have been a terrible job, 
putting those sections together 
and separating them, even in 
free space.” 

“They used space anchors. 
That trench I mentioned? It has 
a forcefield bottom, so an anchor 
could be sunk through it; then 
the whole section could be slid 
straight forward or back, in or 
out of the bunch . here, 'I’ve 
got it, I think. Put this strip in 
the viewer.” 

One picture, a photograph, 
showed what appeared to be one 
end of a bundle of long needles, 
in a glaring light, against a back- 
ground of stars that looked un- 
real. The legend beneath gave a 
scanty description of the ship in 
flowing Old Empire script. Other 
pictures showed sections of the 
ship in some detail. 

“This must be it, all right,” 


said Marty thoughtfully. “Funny 
looking old tub.” 

“I wonder what happened to 
wreck her.” 

“Drives sometimes exploded 
in those days, that could have 
done it. And this one section got 
anchored to Sol somehow — it’s 
funny.” 

“How long ago did it happen, 
do you suppose?” asked Laura. 
She had her arms folded as if 
she were a little cold, though it 
was not cold in the Clementine. 

“Must be around two thousand 
years or more. These ships 
haven’t been used for about that 
long.” He picked up a stylus. “I 
better go over there with a big 
bag of tools tomorrow and take 
a look inside.” He noted down a 
few things he thought he might 
need. 

“Historians would probably 
pay a good price for the whole 
thing, untouched,” she suggested, 
watching him draw doodles. 

“That’s a thought. But maybe 
there’s something really valuable 
aboard — though I won’t be able 
to give it anything like a thor- 
ough search, of course. The thing 
is anchored, remember. I’ll prob- 
ably have to break in anyway to 
release that.” 

She pointed to one of the dia- 
grams. “Look, a section thirty 
miles long must be one of the 
passenger compartments. And ac- 
cording to this plan, it would 


184 


GALAXY 


have no drive at all of its own. 
We’ll have to tow it.” 

He looked. “Right. Anyway, I 
don’t think I’d care to try its 
drive if it had one.” 

He located airlocks on the 
plan and made himself generally 
familiar with it. 

r T , HE next “morning” found 
Marty loading extra tools, 
gadgets and explosives on his 
bike. The trip to X (he still 
thought of it that way) was un- 
eventful. This time he landed 
about a third of the way from 
one end, where he expected to 
find a handy airlock and have a 
choice of directions to explore 
when he got inside. He hoped to 
get the airlock open without let- 
ting out whatever atmosphere or 
gas was present in any of the 
main compartments, as a sudden 
drop in pressure might damage 
something in the unknown cargo. 

He found a likely-looking spot 
for entry where the plans had 
led him to expect one. It was a 
small auxiliary airlock, only a 
few feet from the space-anchor 
channel. The forcefield bottom of 
that channel was, he knew, use- 
less as a possible doorway. 
Though anchors could be raised 
and lowered through it, they re- 
mained partly imbedded in it at 
all times. Starting a new hole 
from scratch would cause the 
decompression he was trying to 


avoid, and possibly a dangerous 
explosion as well. 

Marty began his attack on the 
airlock door cautiously, working 
with electronic “sounding” gear 
for a few minutes, trying to tell 
if the inner door was closed as 
well. He had about decided that 
it was when something made him 
look up. He raised his head and 
sighted down the dark length of 
X toward Sol. 

Something was moving toward 
him along the hull. 

He was up in the bike saddle 
with his hand on a blaster before 
he realized what it was — that 
moving blur that distorted the 
stars seen through it, like heat 
waves in air. Without doubt, it 
was a space anchor. And it 
moved along the channel. 

Marty rode the bike out a few 
yards and nudged it along slowly, 
following the anchor. It moved 
at about the pace of a fast walk. 
Moved . but it was sunk into 
space. 

“Laura,” he called, “something 
odd here. Doppler this hull for 
me and see if it’s moving.” 

Laura acknowledged in one 
businesslike word. Good girl, he 
thought, I won’t have to worry 
about you. He coasted along the 
hull on the bike, staying even 
with the apparent movement of 
the anchor. 

Laura’s voice came: “It is mov- 
ing now, towards Sol. About six 


THE LONG WAY HOME 


185 


miles per. hour. Maybe less — it’s 
hard to read, so slow.” 

“Good, that’s what I thought.” 
He hoped he sounded reassuring. 
He pondered the situation. It 
was the hull moving then, the 
forcefield channel sliding by the 
fixed anchor. Whatever was caus- 
ing it, it did not seem to be di- 
rected against him or the Clem. 
“Look, baby,” he went on, “some- 
thing peculiar is happening.” He 
explained about the anchor. 
“Clem may be no battleship, but 
I guess she’s a match for any 
piece of wreckage.” 

“But you’re out there!” 

“I have to see this. I never saw 
anything like it before. Don’t 
worry, I’ll pull back if it looks 
at all dangerous.” Something in 
the back of his mind told him to 
go back to his ship and call the 
Navy. He ignored it without 
much trouble. He had never 
thought much of calling the 
Navy. 

About four hours later the in- 
comprehensible anchor neared 
the end of its track, within thirty 
yards of what seemed to be X’s 
stern. It slowed down and came 
to a gradual stop a few yards 
from the end of the track. For a 
minute nothing else happened. 
Marty reported the facts to 
Laura. He sat straight in the bike 
saddle, regarding the universe, 
which offered him no enlighten- 
ment. 


In the space between the an- 
chor and the end of the track, a 
second patterned shimmer ap- 
peared. It must necessarily have 
been let “down” into space from 
inside X. Marty felt a creeping 
chill. After a little while the first 
anchor vanished, withdrawn 
through the forcefield into the 
hull. 

Marty sat watching for twenty 
minutes, but nothing further hap- 
pened. He realized that he had 
a crushing grip on the bike con- 
trols and that he was quivering 
with fatigue. 

T AURA and Marty took turns 
sleeping and watching, that 
night aboard the Clementine. 
About noon the next day Laura 
was at the telescope when anchor 
number one reappeared, now at 
the “prow” of X. After a few mo- 
ments the one at the stern van- 
ished. 

Marty looked at the communi- 
cator that he could use any time 
to call the Navy. Faster-than- 
light travel not being practical so 
near a sun, it would take them 
at least several hours to arrive 
after he decided he needed them. 
Then he beat his fist on the table 
and swore. “Must be some kind 
of mechanism in her still opera- 
ting.” He went to the telescope 
and watched number one anchor 
begin its apparent slow journey 
sternward once again. “I don’t 


186 


GALAXY 


know. I’ve got to settle this.” 
The doppler showed X was 
again creeping toward Sol at 
about six miles an hour. 

“Does it seem likely there’d be 
power left after two thousand 
years to operate such a mecha- 
nism?” Laura asked. 

“I think so. Each passenger 
section had a hydrogen power 
lamp.” He dug out the microfilm 
again. “Yeah, a small fusion 
lamp for electricity to light and 
heat the section, and run the 
emergency equipment for . .” 
His voice trailed off, then con- 
tinued in a dazed tone: “For 
recycling food and water.” 
“Marty, what is it?” 

He stood up, staring at the 
plan. “And the only radios were 
in the lifeboats, and the lifeboats 
are gone. I wonder . sure. 
The explosion could have torn 
them apart, blown them away 
so. 

“What are you talking about?” 
He looked again at their com- 
municator. “A transmitter that 
can get through the noise be- 
tween here and Pluto wouldn’t 
be easy to jury-rig, even now. In 
the Old Empire days . .” 
“What?” 

“Now about air — ” He seemed 
to wake up with a start, looked 
at her sheepishly. “Just an idea 
hit me.” He grinned. “I’m making 
another trip.” 

An hour later he was landing 


on X for the third time, touching 
down near the “stern”. He was 
riding the moving hull toward 
the anchor, but it was still many 
miles away. 

The spot he had picked was 
near another small auxiliary air- 
lock, upon which he began work 
immediately. After ascertaining 
that the inner door was closed, 
he drilled a hole in the outer 
door to relieve any pressure in 
the chamber to keep the outer 
door shut. 

The door opening mechanism 
suffered from twenty-century 
cramp, but a vibrator tool shook 
it loose enough to be operated by 
hand. The inside of the airlock 
looked like nothing more than 
the inside of an airlock. 

TTE patched the hole he had 

*- made in the outer door so 
he would be able — he hoped 
— to open the inner one normal- 
ly. He operated the outer door 
several times to make sure he 
could get out fast if he had to. 
After attaching a few extras from 
the bike to his suit, he said a 
quick and cheerful goodbye to 
Laura — not expecting his radio 
to work from inside the hull — 
and closed himself into the air- 
lock. Using the vibrator again, he 
was able to work the control 
that should let whatever passed 
for hull atmosphere into the 
chamber. It came. His wrist gauge 


THE LONG WAY HOME 


187 


told him pressure was building 
up to approximately spaceship 
normal, and his suit mikes began 
to pick up a faint hollow hum- 
ming from somewhere. He very 
definitely kept suit and helmet 
sealed. 

The inner door worked per- 
fectly, testifying to the skill of 
the Old Empire builders. Marty 
found himself nearly upside down 
as he went through, losing his 
footing and his sense of heroic 
adventure. In return he gained 
the knowledge that X’s artificial 
gravity was still at least partly 
operational. Righting himself, he 
found he was in a small anteroom 
banked with spacesuit lockers, 
now illuminated only by his suit 
lights but showing no other signs 
of damage. There was a door in 
each of the other walls. 

He moved to try the one at 
his right. First drawing his blast- 
er, he hesitated a moment, then 
slid it back into its holster. Swal- 
lowing, he eased the door open to 
find only another empty com- 
partment, about the size of an 
average room and stripped of 
everything down to the bare deck 
and bulkheads. 

Another door led him into a 
narrow passage where a few over- 
head lights burned dimly. Trying 
to watch over his shoulder and 
ahead at the same time, he fol- 
lowed the hall to a winding stair 
and began to climb, moving with 


all the silence possible in a space- 
suit. 

The stair brought him out onto 
a long gallery overlooking what 
could only be the main corridor 
of X, a passage twenty yards 
wide and three decks high; it 
narrowed away to a point in the 
dim-lit distance. 

A man came out of a doorway 
across the corridor, a deck below 
Marty. 

He was an old man and may 
have been nearsighted, for he 
seemed unaware of the space- 
suited figure gripping a railing 
and staring down at him. The old 
man wore a sort of tunic intricate- 
ly embroidered with threads of 
different colors, and well tailored 
to his thin figure, leaving his legs 
and feet bare. He stood for a 
moment peering down the long 
corridor, while Marty stared 
down momentarily frozen in 
shock. 

Marty pulled back two slow 
steps from the railing, to where 
he stood mostly in shadow. Turn- 
ing his head to follow the old 
man’s gaze, he noticed that the 
forcefield where the anchors 
traveled was visible running in 
a sunken strip down the center 
of the corridor. When the inter- 
stellar ship of which X was once 
a part had been in normal use, 
the strip might have been cov- 
ered with a moving walkway of 
some kind.

GALAXY 


''HE old man turned his at- 
tention to a tank where 
grew a mass of plants with flat, 
dark green leaves. He touched a 
leaf, then turned a valve that 
doled water into the tank from a 
thin pipe. Similar valves were 
clustered on the bulkhead be- 
hind the old man, and pipes ran 
from them to many other plant- 
filled tanks set at intervals down 
the corridor. “For oxygen,” Marty 
said aloud in an almost calm 
voice, and was startled at the 
sound in his helmet. His helmet 
airspeaker was not on, so of 
course the old man did not hear 
him. The old man pulled a red 
berry from one of the plants and 
ate it absently. 

Marty made a move with his 
chin to turn on his speaker, but 
did not complete it. He half lifted 
his arms to wave, but fear of the 
not-uriderstood held him, made 
him back up slowly into the 
shadows at the rear of the gallery. 
Turning his head to the right he 
could see the near end of the cor- 
ridor, and an anchor there, not 
sunken in space but raised al- 
most out of the forcefield on a 
framework at the end of the strip. 

Near the stair he had ascended 
was a half-open door, leading into 
darkness. Marty realized he had 
turned off his suit lights with- 
out consciously knowing it. Mov- 
ing carefully so the old man 
would not see, he lit one and 


probed the darkness beyond the 
door cautiously. The room he en- 
tered was the first of a small 
suite that had once been a pas- 
senger cabin. The furniture was 
simple, but it was the first of any 
kind that he had seen aboard X. 
Garments hanging in one corner 
were similar to the old man’s 
tunic, although no two were alike 
exactly. Marty fingered the fabric 
with one armored hand, holding 
it close to his faceplate. He nod- 
ded to himself; it seemed to be 
the kind of stuff produced by fi- 
ber recycling machinery, and he 
doubted very much that it was 
anywhere near two thousand 
years old. 

Marty emerged from the door- 
way of the little apartment, stood 
in shadow with his suit lights out, 
looking around; the old man had 
disappeared. He remembered 
that the old man had gazed down 
the infinite-looking corridor as if 
expecting something. There was 
nothing new in sight that way. 
He turned up the gain of one 
of his suit mikes and focused it 
in that direction. 

Many human voices were sing- 
ing, somewhere down there, miles 
away. He started, and tried to 
interpret what he heard in some 
other way, but with an eerie thrill 
became convinced that his first 
impression was correct. While he 
studied a plan of going back to 
his bike and heading in that di- 


THE LONG WAY HOME

rection, he grew aware that the 
singing was getting louder. And 
therefore no doubt closer. 

TTE leaned back against the 
bulkhead in the shadow at 
the rear of the gallery. His suit, 
dark-colored for space work far 
from Sol, would be practically in- 
visible from the lighted corridor 
below, while he could see down 
with little difficulty. Part of his 
mind urged him to go back to 
Laura, to call the Navy, that these 
unknown people could be dan- 
gerous to him. But ' he had to 
wait and see more of them. He 
grinned wryly as he realized he 
was not going to get any salvage 
out of X after all. 

Sweating in spite of his suit’s 
coolers, he listened to the singing 
grow rapidly louder in his helmet. 
Male and female voices rose and 
fell in an intricate melody, some- 
times blending, sometimes chant- 
ing separate parts. The language 
was unknown to him. 

Suddenly the people were in 
sight, first only as a faint dot of 
color in the distance. As they 
drew nearer he could see that 
they walked in a long neat column 
eight abreast, four on each side 
of the central strip of forcefield. 
Men and women, apparently 
teamed according to no fixed rule 
of age or sex or size — except 
that he saw no oldsters or young 
children. 


The people sang and leaned 
forward as they walked, pulling 
their weight on heavy ropes that 
were intricately decorated, like 
their clothing and that of the old 
man who had now stepped out of 
his doorway again to greet them. 
A few other oldsters of both sexes 
appeared near him to stand and 
wait. Through a briefly opened 
door Marty caught a glimpse of 
a well-lighted room holding ma- 
chines he recognized as looms 
only because of the half-finished 
cloth they held. He shook his head 
wonderingly. 

All at once the walkers were 
very near; hundreds of people 
pulling on ropes that led to a 
multiple whiffletree made of 
twisted metal pipe, that rode 
over the central trench. The 
whiffletree and the space anchor 
to which it. was fastened were 
pulled past Marty — or rather 
the spot from which he watched 
was carried past the fixed anchor 
by the slow, human-powered 
thrust of X toward Sol. 

Behind the anchor came a 
small group of children, from 
about the age of ten up to puber- 
ty. They pulled on small ropes, 
drawing a cart that held what 
looked like containers for food 
and water. At the extreme rear 
of the procession marched a man 
in the prime of life, tall and ath- 
letic, wearing a magnificent head- 
dress. 


THE LONG WAY HOME 


191 


A BOUT the time he drew even 
with Marty, this man stopped 
suddenly (young and old alike 
walked steadily at the same fast 
pace) and uttered a sharp com- 
mand. Instantly the pulling and 
singing ceased. Several men near- 
est the whiffletree moved in and 
loosed it from the anchor with 
quick precision. Others held the 
slackened ropes clear as the enor- 
mous inertia of X’s mass carried 
the end of the forcefield strip 
toward the anchor, which now 
jammed against the framework 
holding anchor number two, 
forcing the framework back 
where there had seemed to be 
no room. 

A thick forcefield pad now be- 
came visible to Marty behind the 
framework, expanding steadily 
as it absorbed the energy of the 
powerful stress between ship and 
anchor. Conduits of some kind, 
Marty saw, led away from the 
pad, possibly to where energy 
might be stored for use when it 
came time to start X creeping 
toward the sun again. A woman 
in a headdress now mounted the 
framework and released anchor 
number two, to drop into space 
“below” the hull and bind X fast 
to the place where it was now 
held by anchor number one. A 
crew of men came forward and 
began to raise anchor number 
one . 

He found himself descending 


the stair, retracing his steps to 
the airlock. Behind him the 
voices of the people were raised 
in a steady recitation that might 
have been a prayer. Feeling some- 
what as if he moved in a dream, 
he made no particular attempt 
at caution, but he met no one. 
He tried to think, to understand 
what he had witnessed. Vaguely, 
comprehension came. 

Outside, he said: “I’m out all 
right, Laura. I want to look at 
something at the other end and 
I’ll come home.” He scarcely 
heard what she said in reply, but 
realized that her answer had been 
almost instantaneous; she must 
have been listening steadily for 
his call all the time. He felt bet- 
ter. 

The bike shot him thirty miles 
down the dream-like length of 
X toward Sol in a few minutes. 
A lot faster than the people in- 
side do their traveling, he thought 
. and Sol was dim ahead. 

Almost recklessly he broke into 
X again, through an airlock near 
the prow. At this end of the force- 
field strip hung a gigantic block 
and tackle that would give a vast 
mechanical advantage to a few 
hundred people pulling against 
an anchor, when it came time for 
them to start the massive hull 
moving toward Sol once more. 

He looked in almost unnoticed 
at a nursery, small children in 
the care of a few women. He

thought one of the babies saw 
him and laughed at him as he 
watched through a hole in a 
bulkhead where a conduit had 
once passed. 

UW/HAT is it?” asked Laura 
impatiently as he stepped 
exhausted out of the shower 
room aboard the Clem, wrapping 
a robe around him. He could see 
his shock suddenly mirrored in 
her face. 

“People,” he said, sitting down. 
“Alive over there. Earth people. 
Humans.” 

“You’re all right?” 

“Sure. It’s just — Godl” He 
told her about it briefly. “They 
must be descended from the sur- 
vivors of the accident, whatever 
it was. Physically there’s no rea- 
son why they couldn’t live when 
you come to think of it — even 
reproduce up to a limited num- 
ber. Plants for oxygen — I bet 
their air’s as good as ours. Re- 
cycling equipment for food and 
water, and the hydrogen power 
lamp still working to run it, and 
to give them light and gravity 
. they have about everything 
they need. Everything but a 
space-drive.” He leaned back 
with a sigh and closed his eyes. 
It was hard for him to stop talk- 
ing to her. 

She was silent for a little, try- 
ing to assimilate it all. “But if 
they have hydrogen power 


couldn’t they have rigged some- 
thing?” she finally asked. “Some 
kind of a drive, even if it was 
slow? Just one push and they’d 
keep moving.” 

Marty thought it over. “Moving 
a little faster won’t help them.” 
He sat up and opened his eyes 
again. “And they’d have a lot 
less work to do every day. I 
imagine too large a dose of lei- 
sure time could be fatal to all 
of them. 

“Somehow they had the will 
to keep going, and the intelli- 
gence to find a way, to evolve a 
system of life that worked for 
them, that kept them from going 
wild and killing each other. And 
their children, and their grand- 
children, and after that . 
Slowly he stood up. She followed 
him into the control room, where 
they stood watching the image 
of X that was still focused on the 
telescope screen. 

“All those years,” Laura whis- 
pered. “All that time.” 

“Do you realize what they’re 
doing?” he asked softly. “They’re 
not just surviving, turned inward 
on weaving and designing and 
music. 

“In a few hours they’re going to 
get up and start another day’s 
work. They’re going to pull an- 
chor number one back to the 
front of their ship and lower it. 
That’s their morning job. Then 
someone left in the rear will raise 


THE LONG WAY HOME

anchor number two. Then the 
main group will start pulling 
against number one, as I saw 
them doing a little while ago, 
and their ship will begin to move 
toward Sol. Every day they go 
through this they move about 
thirty miles closer to home. 

“Honey, these people are walk- 
ing home and pulling their ship 
with them. It must be a religion 
with them by now, or something 
very near it . .” He put an arm 
around Laura. 

U M ARTY . how long would 
it take them?” 

“Space is big,” he said in a 
flat voice, as if quoting something 
he had been required to memo- 
rize. 

After a few moments he con- 
tinued. “I said just moving a little 
faster won’t help them. Let’s say 
they’ve traveled thirty miles a 
day for two thousand years. 
That’s — somewhere near twen- 
ty-two million miles. Almost 
enough to get from Mars to 
Earth at their nearest approach. 
But they’ve got a long way to 
go to reach the neighborhood of 
Mars’ orbit. We’re well out be- 
yond Pluto here. Practically 
speaking, they’re just about 
where they started from.” He 
smiled wanly. “Really they’re not 
far from home, for an interstellar 


ship. They had their accident al- 
most on the doorstep of their 
own solar system, and they’ve 
been walking toward the thresh- 
old ever since.” 

Laura went to the communi- 
cator and began to set it up for 
the call that would bring the 
Navy within a few hours. She 
paused. “How long would it take 
them now,” she asked, “to get 
somewhere near Earth?” 

“Hell would freeze over. But 
they can’t know that any more, 
or maybe they still know it and 
it just doesn’t bother them. They 
must just go on, tugging at that 
damned anchor day after day, 
year after year, with maybe a 
holiday now and then ... I don’t 
know how they do it. They work 
and sing and feel they’re accom- 
plishing something ... and really, 
they are, you know. They have 
a goal and they are moving 
toward it. I wonder what they 
say of Earth, how they think 
about it.” 

Slowly Laura continued to set 
up the communicator. 

Marty watched her. “Are you 
sure?” he pleaded suddenly. 
“What are we doing to them?” 
But she had already sent the 
call. 

For better or worse, the long 
voyage was almost over.
