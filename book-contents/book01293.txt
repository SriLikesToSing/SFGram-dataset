KICK YOURSELF AGAIN 



A local feller just got himself 
a patent on a new cigarette 
filter. vSeems that the semi-precious 
mineral tourmaline is pyroelectric; 
that is, when heated, tourmaline 
crystals become polarized, with a 
negative charge at one end and a 
positive charge at the other. Ciga- 
rette smoke is warm enough to 
bring this about. The charged crys- 
tals attract and trap tar particles. 
He claims his filters can compete 
favorably with lesser breeds. 

Here’s a perfect candidate for 
what I called here, about a year 
ago, the Kick Yourself Department. 
This contains all the ideas that were 
staring you right in the face all 
along, you fool you, until some oth- 
er guy came along and turned it 
into money. Not that this odd qual- 



ity of tourmaline is exactly staring 
you in the face. It has, however, 
surely been known for a long time; 
but it takes one guy with that spe- 
cial connection in his cranial wiring 
to put it to work. The m.an who 
invented the filter had been ordered 
by his doctor to quit smoking, which 
he reluctantly did; he was annoyed 
enough to work on the problem. He 
actually built an electrostatic filter 
in a holder, powered by batteries. 
Then, when his son brought some 
books home from college, he bump- 
ed into the tourmaline thing — and 
there you go. 

My son’s exhibit in the Science 
Fair last year was a microscope 
made of a juice can and a soup can, 
some wood scraps and some slips of 
window-glass. The lens is a drop of

There’s a Kick Yourself if there

T here are plenty of phenom- 
ena kicking around waiting to 
get broke and harnessed. Some arc 
right out front, and some are hiding 
in Joe College’s science book, but 
they’re around. For instance, if you 
use palladium as one electrode in 
an electrolysis tank, you won’t get 
any hydrogen gas for quite a time, 
because the palladium will absorb 
nearly a thousand times its own 
volume of hydrogen. It gloms on 
to the H2 good and hard, too — 



you can’t scrape it off, knock it 
off or pump it out. Heat will do it 
easily. Hasn’t anyone got a home 
for that? Then there’s the Barr 
Effect — the ballet a drop of water 
will perform on a sheet of hot 
metal — which I haven't space to 
describe here but which Steve Him- 
self Barr has written up. Sugar- 
lumps will sometimes give off light 
when rubbed or broken in the dark. 
A balloon filled with C02 is attracted 
to the resonance box of a tuning 
fork. One filled with hydrogen is 
repelled. An iron tank containing 
gas under pressure will lose it all 
if heated red, even though no meas- 
urable opening appears, and it be- 
comes gas-tight when it cods. 

Do you have any like these — 
useless, or little-used, or little- 
known unharnessed phenomena? If 
so, send ’em in! When we’ve accum- 
ulated enough, we’ll run a column 
on them, with names of the donors 
included. 

Who knows? You might be re- 
sponsible for the invention-ignition 
process in an Edison or Steinmetz 
who won’t know he is one until he 
sees your contribution. 

If I sparked some stranger that 
way, I might kick myself a little — 
but I think I’d be glad to do it!

BY A. E. VAN VOGT 



The alien was deadly, dangerous 
and inhuman — but he was not the 
most feared enemy on the ship! 

ILLUSTRATED BY FINLAY 



I 

O ne hundred and nine years 
after leaving Earth, the space- 
ship, Hope of Man, went into orbit 
around Alta III. 

The following “morning” Captain 
Browne informed the shipload of 
fourth and fifth generation colonists 
that a manned lifeboat would be 
dropped to the planet’s surface. 
“Every member of the crew must 

THE EXPENDABLES 



consider himself expendable,” he 
said earnestly. “This is the day that 
our great grandparents, our fore- 
fathers, who boldly set out for the 
new space frontier so long ago, 
looked forward to with unfaltering 
courage. We must not fail them.” 
He concluded his announcement 
over the intercom system of the big 
ship by saying that the names of 
the crew members of the lifeboat 
would be given out within the hour. 

y 





“And I know that every real man 
aboard will want to see his name 
there/’ 

John Lesbee, the fifth of his line 
aboard, had a sinking sensation as 
he heard those words — and he 
was not mistaken. 

Even as he tried to decide if he 
should give the signal for a desper- 
ate act of rebellion, Captain Browne 
made the expected announcement. 

The commander said, “And I 
know you will all join him in his 
moment of pride and courage when 
I tell you that John Lesbee will lead 
the crew that carries the hopes of 
man in this remote area of space. 
And now the others — ” 

He thereupon named seven of the 
nine persons with whom Lesbee had 
been conspiring to seize control of 
the ship. 

Since the lifeboat would only hold 
eight persons, Lesbee recognized 
that Browne was dispatching as 
many of his enemies as he could. 
He listened with a developing dis- 
may, as the commander ordered all 
persons on the ship to come to the 
recreation room. “Here I request 
that the crew of the lifeboat join 
me and the other officers on stage. 
Their instructions are to surrender 
themselves to any craft which seeks 
to intercept them. They will be 
equipped with instruments whereby 
we here can watch, and determine 
the stage of scientific attainments 
of the dominant race on the planet 
below.” 

L esbee hurried to his room 
on the technicians’ deck, hop- 
ing that perhaps Tellier or Cantlin 



would seek him out there. He felt 
himself in need of a council of war, 
however brief. He waited five min- 
utes, but not one member of his 
conspiratorial group showed. 

Nonetheless, he had time to grow 
calm. Peculiarly, it was the smell 
of the ship that soothed him most. 
From the earliest days of his life, 
the odor of energy and the scent 
of metal under stress had been per- 
petual companions. At the moment, 
with the ship in orbit, there was a 
letting up of stress. The smell was 
of old energies rather than new. 
But the effect was similar. 

He sat in the chair he used for 
reading, eyes closed, breathing in 
that complex of odors, product of 
so many titanic energies. Sitting 
there, he felt the fear leave his mind 
and body. He grew brave again, 
and strong. 

Lesbee recognized soberly that 
his plan to seize power had involved 
risks. Worse, no one would question 
Browne’s choice of him as the leader 
of the mission. “I am,” thought Les- 
bee, “probably the most highly 
trained technician ever to be on 
this ship.” Browne Three had taken 
him when he was ten, and started 
him on the long grind of learning 
that led him, one after the other, 
to master the mechanical skills of 
all the various technical depart- 
ments. And Browne Four had con- 
tinued his training. 

He was taught how to repair re- 
lay systems. He gradually came to 
understand the purposes of count- 
less analogs. The time came when he 
could visualize the entire automa- 
tion. Long ago, the colossal cobweb 

IF

of electronic instruments within the 
walls had become almost an exten- 
sion of his nervous system. 

^ During those years of work and 
study, each daily apprenticeship 
chore left his slim body exhausted. 
After he came off duty, he sought 
a brief relaxation and usually re- 
tired to an early rest. 

He never did find the time to 
learn the intricate theory that un- 
derlay the ship’s many operations. 

His father, while he was alive, 
had made numerous attempts to 
pass his knowledge on to his son. 
But it was hard to teach complexi- 
ties to a tired and sleepy boy. Les- 
bee even felt slightly relieved when 
his parent died. It took the pressure 
off him. Since then, however, he 
had come to realize that the Browne 
family, by forcing a lesser skill on 
the descendant of the original com- 
mander of the ship, had won their 
greatest victory. 

As he headed finally for the rec- 
reation room, Lesbee found himself 
wondering: Had the Brownes train- 
ed him with the intention of pre- 
paring him for such a mission as 
this? 

His eyes widened. If that was 
true, then his own conspiracy was 
merely an excuse. The decision to 
kill him might actually have been 
made more than a decade ago, and 
light years away. 

A s the lifeboat fell toward Al- 
ta III, Lesbee and Tellier 
sat in the twin control chairs and 
watched on the forward screen the 
vast, misty atmosphere of the 
planet. 



Tellier was thin and intellectual, 
a descendant of the physicist Dr. 
Tellier who had made many speed 
experiments in the early days of 
the voyage. It had never been un- 
derstood why spaceships could not 
attain even a good fraction of the 
speed of light, let alone velocities 
greater than light. When the scien- 
tist met his untimely death, there 
was no one with the training to 
carry on a testing program. 

It was vaguely believed by the 
trained personnel who succeeded 
Tellier that the ship had run into 
one of the paradoxes implicit in 
the Lorenz-Fitzgerald Contraction 
theory. 

Whatever the explanation, it was 
never solved. 

Watching Tellier, Lesbee wonder- 
ed if his companion and best friend 
felt as empty inside as he did. In- 
credibly, this was the first time he 
— or anyone — had been outside 
the big ship. “We’re actually head- 
ing down,” he thought, “to one of 
those great masses of land and wa- 
ter, a planet.” 

As he watched, fascinated, the 
massive ball grew visibly bigger. 

They came in at a slant, a long, 
swift, angling approach, ready to 
jet away if any of the natural radia- 
tion belts proved too much for their 
defense systems. But as each stage 
of radiation registered in turn, the 
dials showed that the lifeboat ma- 
chinery made the proper responses 
automatically. 

The silence was shattered sudden- 
ly by an alarm bell. 

Simultaneously, one of the screens 
focused on a point of rapidly mov- 

IF 



10 




ing light far below. The light darted 
toward them. 

A missile! 

Lesbee caught his breath. 

But the shining projectile veered 
off, turned completely around, look 
up position several miles away, and 
began to fall with them. 

His first thought was; “They’ll 
never let us land,” and he experi- 
enced an intense disappointment. 

Another signal brrred from the 
control board. 

“They’re probing us,” said Tellier, 
tensely. 

An instant after the words were 
uttered, the lifeboat seemed to shud- 
der and to stiffen under them. It was 
the unmistakable feel of a tractor 
beam. Its field clutched the life- 
boat, drew it, held it. 

The science of the Alta III in- 
habitants was already proving itself 
formidable. 

Underneath him the lifeboat con- 
tinued its movement. 

The entire crew gathered around 
and watched as the point of bright- 
ness resolved into an object, which 
rapidly grew larger. It loomed up 
close, bigger than they. 

There was a metallic bump. The 
lifeboat shuddered from stem to 
stem. 

Even before the vibrations ceased 
Tellier said, “Notice they put our 
airlock against theirs.” 

Behind Lesbee, his companions 
began that peculiar joking of the 
threatened. It was a coarse comedy, 
but it had enough actual humor 
suddenly to break through his fear. 
Involuntarily he found himself 
laughing. 



Then, momentarily free of anx- 
iety, aware that Browne was watch- 
ing and that there was no escape;, 
he said, “Open the airiock! Let the 
aliens capture us as ordered.” 

II 

A few minutes after the outer 
airlock was opened, the air- 
lock of the alien ship folded back 
also. Rubberized devices rolled out 
and contacted the Earth lifeboat, 
sealing off both entrances from the 
vacuum of space. 

Air hissed into the interlocking 
passageway between the two craft. 
In the alien craft’s lock, an inner 
door opened. 

Again Lesbee held his breath. 
There was a movement in the 
passageway. A creature ambled in- 
to view. The being came forward 
with complete assurance, and 
pounded with something he held at 
the end of one of his four leathery 
arms on the hull. 

The creature had four legs and 
four arms, and a long thin body held 
straight up. It had almost no neck, 
yet the many skin folds between 
the head and the body indicated 
great flexibility was possible. 

Even as Lesbee noted the details 
of its appearance, the being turned 
his head slightly, and its two large 
expressionless eyes gazed straight at 
the hidden wall receptor that was 
photographing the scene, and there- 
fore straight into Lesbee’s eyes. 

Lesbee blinked at the creature, 
then tore his gaze away, swallowed 
hard, and nodded at Tellier. “Open 
up!” hr commanded. 



THE EXPENDABLES 



11 




The moment the inner door of 
the Earth lifeboat opened, six more 
of the four-legged beings appeared 
ojic after another in the passageway, 
and walked forward in the same 
confident way as had the first. 

All seven creatures entered the 
open door of the lifeboat. 

As they entered their thoughts 
came instantly into Lesbee’s mind. 

A s Dzing and his boarding party 
trotted from the small Karn 
ship through the connecting airlock, 
his chief officer thought a message 
to him. 

''Air pressure and oxygen content 
are within a tiny percentage of what 
exists at ground level on Karn. They 
can certainly live on our planet.” 
Dzing moved forward into the 
Earth ship, and realized that he was 
in the craft’s control chamber. 
There, for the first time, he saw 
the men. He and his crew ceased 
their forward motion; and the two 
groups of beings — the humans and 
the Karn — gazed at each other. 

The appearance of the two-legged 
beings did not surprise Dzing. Pulse 
viewers had, earlier, penetrated the 
metal walls of the lifeboat and had 
accurately photographed the shape 
and dimension of those aboard. 

His first instruction to his crew 
was designed to test if the strangers 
were, in fact, surrendering. He 
commanded: “Convey to the prison- 
ers that we require them as a pre- 
caution to remove their clothing.” 
. Until that direction was given, 
Lesbee was still uncertain as to 
whether or not these beings could 
receive human thoughts as he was 

12 



receiving theirs. From the first mo- 
ment, the aliens had conducted 
their mental conversations as if they 
were unaware of the thoughts of 
the human beings. Now he watched 
the Karn come forward. One tugged 
suggestively at his clothing. And 
there was no doubt. 

The mental telepathy was a one- 
way flow only — from the Karn 
to the humans. 

He was already savoring the im- 
plications of that as he hastily un- 
dressed. It was absolutely vital 
that Browne do not find it out. 

Lesbee removed all his clothes; 
then, before laying them down, took 
out his notebook and pen. Standing 
there naked he wrote hurriedly: 
“Don’t let on that we can read 
the minds of these beings.” 

He handed the notebook around, 
and he felt a lot better as each of 
the men read it, and nodded at him 
silently. 

Dzing communicated telepathical- 
ly with someone on the ground. 
“These strangers,” he reported, 
“clearly acted under command to 
surrender. The problem is, how can 
we now' let them overcome us with- 
out arousing their suspicion that 
this is what we want them to do?” 
Lesbee did not receive the an- 
swer directly. But he picked it up 
from Dzing’s mind: “Start tear- 

ing the lifeboat apart. See if that 
brings a reaction.” 

T he members of the Kam 
boarding party went to work 
at once. Off came the control 
panels; floor plates were melted and 
ripped up. Soon instruments, wiring, 

it 




controls were exposed for examina- 
tion. Most interesting of all to the 
aliens were the numerous computers 
and their accessories. 

Browne must have watched the 
destruction; for now, before the 
Karn could start wrecking the auto- 
matic machinery, his voice inter- 
jected: 

‘'Watch out, you men! I’m going 
to shut your airlock and cause your 
boat to make a sharp right turn in 
exactly twenty seconds.” 

Few Lesbee and Tellier that 
simply meant sitting down in their 
chairs, and turning them so that 
the acceleration pressure would 
press them against the backs. The 
other men sank to the ripped-up 
floor, and braced themselves. 

Underneath Dzing, the ship 
swerved. The turn began slowly, but 
it propelled him and his fellows over 
to one wall of the control room. 
There he grabbed with his numer- 
ous hands at some handholds that 
had suddenly moved out from the 
smooth metal. By the time the turn 
grew sharper, he had his four short 
legs braced, and he took the rest of 
the wide swing around with every 
part of his long, sleek body taut. 
His companions did the same. 

Presently, the awful pressure 
eased up, and he was able to esti- 
mate that their new direction was 
almost at right angles to what it had 
been. 

He had reported what was hap- 
pening while it was going on. Now, 
the answer came: “Keep on destroy- 
ing. See what they do, and be pre- 
pared to succumb to anything that 
looks like a lethal attack.” 



Lesbee wrote quickly in his note- 
book: “Our method of capturing 
them doesn’t have to be subtle. 
They’ll make it easy for us — so 
we can’t lose.” 

Lesbee waited tensely as the note- 
book was passed around. It was still 
hard for him to believe that no one 
else had noticed what he had about 
this boarding party. 

Tellier added a note of his own: 
“It’s obvious now that these beings 
were also instructed to consider 
themselves expendable.” 

And that settled it for Lesbee. 
The others hadn’t noticed what he 
had. He sighed with relief at the 
false analysis, for it gave him that 
most perfect of all advantages: that 
which derived from his special edu- 
cation. 

Apparently, he alone knew 
enough to have analyzed what these 
creatures were. 

The proof was in the immense 
clarity of their thoughts. Long ago, 
on earth, it had been established 
that man had a faltering telepathic 
ability, which could be utilized con- 
sistently only by electronic amplifi- 
cation outside his brain. The amount 
of energy needed for the step-up 
process was enough to burn out 
brain nerves, if applied directly. 

Since the Karn were utilizing it 
directly, they couldn’t be living be- 
ings. 

Therefore, Dzing and his fellows 
were an advanced robot type. 

The true inhabitants of Alta III 
were not risking their own skins at 
all. 

Far more important to Lesbee, he 
could see how he might use these 



THE EXPENDABLES 



13 




marvellous mechanisms to defeat 
Browne, take over the Hope of 
Man, and start the long journey back 
to Earth. 

m 

H e had been watching the 
Karn at their work ot de- 
struction, while he had these 
thoughts. Now, he said aloud: 
“Hainker, Graves.” 

‘‘Yes?” The two men spoke to- 
gether. 

“In a few moments Tm going to 
ask Captain Browne to turn the ship 
again. When he does, use our speci- 
men gas guns!” 

The men grinned with relief. 
“Consider it done,” said Hainker. 

Lesbee ordered the other four 
crewmen to be ready to use the 
specimen-holding devices at top 
speed. To Tcllier he said, “You take 
charge if anything happens to me.” 
Then he wrote one more message 
in the notebook: “These beings will 
probably continue their mental in- 
tercommunication after they are 
app£vrently rendered unconscious. 
Pay no attention, and do not com- 
ment on it in any way.” 

He felt a lot better when that 
statement also had been read by 
the others, and the notebook was 
once more in his possession. Quick- 
ly, he spoke to the screen: 

“Captain Browne! Make another 
turn, just enough to pin them,” 
And so they captured Dzing and 
his crew. 

As he had expected, the Karn 
continued their telepathic conversa- 
tion. Dzing reported to his ground 



contact: “I think we did that rather 
well.” 

There must have been an answer- 
ing message from below, because 
he went on, “Yes, commander. We 
are now prisoners as per your in- 
structions, and shall await events. 
The imprisoning method? Each of 
us is pinned down by a machine 
which has been placed astride us, 
with the main section adjusted to 
the contour of our bodies. A series 
of rigid metal appendages fasten our 
arms and legs. All these devices are 
electronically controlled, and we 
can of course escape at any time. 
Naturally, such action is for later. .” 

Lesbee was chilled by the analy- 
sis; but for expendables there was 
no turning back. 

He ordered his men: “Get dressed. 
Then start repairing the ship. Put 
all the floor plates back except the 
section at G-8. They removed some 
of the analogs, and Td better make 
sure myself that it all goes back all 
right.” 

When he had dressed, he reset 
the course of the lifeboat, and 
called Browne. The screen lit up 
after a moment, and there staring 
back at him was the unhappy coun- 
tenance of the forty-year-old officer. 

Browne said glumly: “I want to 
congratulate you and your crew on 
your accomplishments. It would 
seem that we have a small scientific 
superiority over this race, and that 
we can attempt a li.mited landing.” 

Since there would never be a 
landing on Alta 111, Lesbee simply 
waited without comment as Browne 
seemed lost in thought. 

The officer stirred finally. He

still seemed uncertain, “Mr. Lesbee,** 
he said, “as you must understand, 
this is an extremely dangerous situa- 
tion for me — and — ” he added 
hastily — “for this entire expedi- 
tion/’ 

What struck Lesbee, as he heard 
those words, was that Browne was 
not going to let him back on the 
ship. But he had to get aboard to 
accomplish his own purpose. He 
thought: “I’ll have to bring this 

whole conspiracy out into the open, 
and apparently make a compromise 
offer.” 

He drew a deep breath, gazed 
straight into the eyes of Browne’s 
image on the screen and said with 
the complete courage of a man for 
whom there is no turning back: “It 
seems to me, sir, that we have two 
alternatives. We can resolve all 
these personal problems either 
through a democratic election or by 
a joint captaincy, you being one of 
the captains and I being the other.” 

'T'o any other person who might 
A have been listening the remark 
must have seemed a complete non 
sequitur. Browne, however, under- 
stood its relevance. He said with a 
sneer, “So you’re out in the open. 
Well, let me tell you, Mr. Lesbee, 
there was never any talk of elections 
when the Lesbees were in power. 
And for a very good reason. A 
spaceship requires a technical aris- 
tocracy to command it. As for a 
joint captaincy, it wouldn’t work.” 

Lesbee urged his lie: “If we’re go- 
ing to stay here, we’ll need at least 
two people of equal authority — 
one on the ground, one on the ship.” 



“I couldn’t trust you on the ship!” 
said Browne flatly. 

“Then you be on the ship,” Lesbee 
proposed. “All such practical details 
can be arranged.” 

The older man must have been 
almost beside himself with the in- 
tensity of his own feelings on this 
subject. He flashed, “Your family 
has been out of power for over fifty 
years! How can you still feel that 
you have any rights?” 

Lesbee countered, “How come 
you still know what I’m talking 
about?” 

Browne said, a grinding rage in 
his tone, “The concept of inherited 
power was introduced by the first 
Lesbee. It was never planned.” 
“But here you are,” said Lesbee, 
“yourself a beneficiary of inherited 
power.” 

Browne said from between 
clenched teeth: “It’s absolutely ridic- 
ulous that the Earth government 
which was in power when the ship 
left — and every member of which 
has been long dead — should ap- 
point somebody to a command posi- 
tion . and that now his descend- 
ant think that command post should 
be his, and his family’s, for all time!” 
Lesbee was silent, startled by the 
dark emotions he had uncovered in 
the man. He felt even more justified, 
if that were possible, and advanced 
his next suggestion without a qualm. 

“Captain, this is a crisis. We 
should postpone our private strug- 
gle. Why don’t we bring one of 
these prisoners aboard so that we 
can question him by use of films, 
or play acting? Later, we can dis- 
cuss your situation and mine.” 



THE EXPENDABLES 



15 




He saw from the look on 
Browne’s face that the reasonable- 
ness of the suggestion, and its po- 
tentialities, were penetrating. 

Browne said quickly, “Only you 
come aboard — and with one pri- 
soner only. No one else!” 

Lesbee felt a dizzying thrill as the 
man responded to his bait. He 
thought: “It’s like an exercise in 
logic. He’ll try to murder me as soon 
as he gets me al<^ne and is satisfied 
that he can attack without danger to 
himself. But that very scheme is 
what will get me aboard. And I’ve 
got to get on the ship to carry out 
my plan.” 

Browne was frowning. He said in 
a concerned tone: “Mr. Lesbee, can 
you think of any reason why we 
should not bring one of these beings 
aboard?” 

Lesbee shook his head. “No rea- 
son, sir,” he lied. 

Browne seemed to come to a de- 
cision. “Very well. I’ll see you short- 
ly, and we can then discuss addition- 
al details.” 

Lesbee dared not say another 
word. He nodded, and broke the 
connection, shuddering, disturbed, 
uneasy. 

“But,” he thought, “what else can 
we do?” 

H e turned his attention to the 
part of the floor that had been 
left open for him. Quickly, he bent 
down and studied the codes on each 
of the programming units, as if he 
were seeking exactly the right ones 
that had originally been in those 
slots 

He found the series he wanted: 



an intricate system of cross-connect- 
ed units that had originally been 
designed to program a remote-con- 
trol landing system, an advanced 
Waldo mechanism capable of land- 
ing the craft on a planet and taking 
off again, all directed on the pulse 
level of human thought. 

He slid each unit of the series 
into its sequential position and 
locked it in. 

Then, that important task com- 
pleted, he picked up the remote con- 
trol attachment for the series and 
casually put it in his pocket. 

He returned to the control board 
and spent several minutes examin- 
ing the wiring and comparing it with 
a wall chart. A number of wires 
had been torn loose. These he now 
re-connected, and at the same time 
he managed with a twist of his pliers 
to short-circuit a key relay .')f the 
remote control pilot. 

Lesbee replaced the panel itself 
loosely. There was no time to con- 
nect it properly. And, since he 
could easily justify his next move, 
he pulled a cage out of the store- 
room. Into this he hoisted Dzing, 
manacles and all. 

Before lowering the lid he rigged 
into the cage a simple resistor that 
would prevent the Karn from broad- 
casting on the human thought level. 
The device was simple merely in 
that it was not selective. It had an 
on-off switch which triggered, or 
stopped, energy flow in the metal 
walls on the thought level. 

When the device was installed, 
Lesbee slipped the tiny remote con- 
trol for it into his other pocket. Ho 
did not activate the control. Not yet. 

IF

From the cage Dzing telepathed: 
is significant that these beings 
have selected me for this special at- 
tention. We might conclude that it 
is a matter of mathematical acci- 
dent, or else that they are very ob- 
servant and so noticed that 1 was 
the one who directed activities. 
Whatever the reason, it would be 
foolish to turn back now.” 

A bell began to ring. As Lesbee 
watched, a spot of light appeared 
high on one of the screens. It moved 
rapidly toward some crossed lines 
in the exact center of the screen. 
Inexorably, then, the Hope of Man, 
as represented by the light, and the 
lifeboat moved toward their fateful 
rendezvous. 

IV 

B rowne’s instructions were: “Come 
to Control Room Below!” 
Lesbee guided his powered dolly 
with the cage on it out of the big 
ship’s airlock P — and saw that the 
man in the control room of the lock 
was Second Officer Selwyn. Heavy 
brass for such a routine task. 
Selwyn waved at him with a twisted 
smile as Lesbee wheeled his cargo 
along the silent corridor. 

He saw no one else on his route. 
Other personnel had evidently been 
cleared from this part of the vessel. 
A little later, grim and determined, 
he set the cage down in the center 
of the big room and anchored it 
magnetically to the floor. 

As Lesbee entered the captain’s 
office, Browne looked up from one 
of the two control chairs and 
stepped down from the rubber- 
sheathed dais to the same level as 



Lesbee. He came forward, smiling, 
and held out his hand. He was a big 
man, as all the Brownes had been, 
bigger by a head than Lesbee, good- 
looking in a clean-cut way. The two 
men were alone. 

“I’m glad you were so frank,” he 
said. “I doubt if I could have spoken 
so bluntly to you without your ini- 
tiative as an example.” 

But as they shook hands, Lesbee 
was wary and suspicious. Lesbee 
thought: “He’s trying to recover 
from the insanity of his reaction. I 
really blew him wide open,” 

Browne continued in the same 
hearty tone: “I’ve made up my 

mind. An election is out of the 
question. The ship is swarming with 
untrained dissident groups, most of 
which simply want to go back to 
Earth.” 

Lesbee, who had the same desire, 
was discreetly silent. 

Browne said, “You’ll be ground 
captain; I’ll be ship captain. Why 
don’t we sit down right now and 
work out a communique on which 
we can agree and that I can read 
over the intercom to the others?” 
As Lesbee seated himself in the 
chair beside Browne, he was think- 
ing: “What can be gained from pub- 
licly naming me ground captain?” 
He concluded finally, cynically, 
that the older man could gain the 
confidence of John Lesbee — lull 
him, lead him on, delude him, de- 
stroy him. 

Surreptitiously Lesbee examined 
the room. Control Room Below was^ 
a large square chamber adjoining 
the massive central engines. Its con- 
trol board was a duplicate of the 



THE EXPENDABLES 



17 




one on the bridge located at the 
top of the ship. The great vessel 
could be guided equally from either 
board, except that pre-emptive pow- 
er was on the bridge. The officer 
of the watch was given the right to 
make Merit decisions in an emer- 
gency. 

Lesbee made a quick mental cal- 
culation, and deduced that it was 
First Officer Miller’s watch on the 
bridge. Miller was a staunch sup- 
porter of Browne. The man was 
probably watching them on one of 
his screens, ready to come to 
Browne’s aid at a moment’s notice. 

A few minutes later. Lesbee lis- 
tened thoughtfully as Browne 
read their joint communique over 
the intercom, designating him as 
ground captain. He found him- 
self a little amazed, and consider- 
ably dismayed, at the absolute con- 
fidence the older man must feel 
about his own power and position 
on the ship. It was a big step, nam- 
ing his chief rival to so high a rank. 

Browne’s next act was equally 
surprising. While they were still on 
the viewers, Browne reached over, 
clapped Lesbee affectionately on 
the shoulders and said to the watch- 
ing audience: 

“As you all know, John is the 
only direct descendant of the orig- 
inal captain. No one knows exactly 
what happened half a hundred years 
ago when my grandfather first took 
command. But I remember the old 
man always felt that only he under- 
stood how things should be. I doubt 
if he had any confidence in any 
young whippersnapper over whom 



he did not have complete control. 
I often felt that my father was the 
victim rather than the beneficiary 
of my grandfather’s temper and feel- 
ings of superiority.” 

Browne smiled engagingly. “Any- 
way, good people, though we can’t 
unbreak the eggs that were broken 
then, we can certainly start healing 
the wounds, without — ” his tone 
was suddenly firm — “negating the 
fact that my own training and ex- 
perience make me the proper com- 
mander of the ship itself.” 

He broke off. “Captain Lesbee 
and I shall now jointly attempt to 
communicate with the captured in- 
telligent life form from the planet 
below. You may watch, though we 
reserve the right to cut you off for 
good reason.” He turned to Lesbee. 
“What do you think we should do 
first, John?” 

Lesbee was in a dilemma. The 
first large doubt had come to him, 
the possibility that perhaps the other 
was sincere. The possibility was 
especially disturbing because in a 
few moments a part of his own plan 
would be revealed. 

He sighed, and realized that there 
was no turning back at this stage. 
He thought: “We’ll have to bring 
the entire madness out into the 
open, and only then can we begin 
to consider agreement as real.” 

Aloud, he said in a steady voice, 
“Why not bring the prisoner out 
where we can see him?” 

As the tractor beam lifted Dzing 
out of the cage, and thus away from 
the energies that had suppressed his 
thought waves, the Karn telepathed 
to his contact on Alta III: 



18 



IF 




“Have been held in a confined 
space, the metal of which was 
energized against communication. I 
shall now attempt to perceive and 
evalute the condition and perform- 
ance of this ship — ” 

At that point, Browne reached 
over and clicked off the intercom. 
Having shut off the audience, he 
turned accusingly to Lesbee, and 
said, “Explain your failure to in- 
form me that these beings communi- 
cated by telepathy.” 

The tone of his voice was threat- 
ening. There was a hint of angry 
color in his face. 

It was the moment of discovery, 

L esbee hesitated, and then simply 
pointed out how precarious 
their relationship had been. He 
finished frankly, “I thought by 
keeping it a secret I might be able 
to stay alive a little longer, which 
was certainly not what you intended 
when you sent me out as an ex- 
pendable.” 

Browne snapped, ‘^But how did 
you hope to utilize? — ” 

He stopped. “Never mind,” he 
muttered. 

Dzing was telepathing again: 

“In many ways this is mechanical- 
ly a very advanced type ship. Atomic 
energy drives are correctly installed. 
The automatic machinery performs 
magnificently. There is massive 
energy screen equipment, and they 
can put out a tractor beam to 
match anything we have that’s mo- 
bile. But there is a wrongness in the 
energy flows of this ship, which I 
lack the experience to interpret. Let 
me furnish you some data. 



The data consisted of variable 
wave measurements, evidently — 
so Lesbee deduced — the wave- 
lengths of the energy flows involved 
in the “wrongness.” 

He said in alarm at that point, 
“Better drop him into the cage 
while yye analyze what he could be 
talking about.” 

Browne did so — as Dzing tele- 
pathed: “If what you suggest is true, 
then these beings are completely at 
our mercy — ” 

Cur off! 

Browne was turning on the inter- 
com. “Sorry I had to cut you good 
people off,” he said. “You’ll be in- 
terested to know that we have man- 
aged to tune in on the thought 
pulses of the prisoner and have in- 
tercepted his calls to someone on 
the planet below. This gives us an 
advantage.” He turned to Lesbee. 
“Don’t you agree?” 

Browne visibly showed no anx- 
iety, whereas Dzing’s final state- 
ment flabbergasted Lesbee. “. 
completely at our mercy . .” surely 
meant exactly that. He was stag- 
gered that Browne could have 
missed the momentous meaning. 

Browne addressed him enthusias- 
tically, “Tm excited by this tele- 
pathy! It’s a marvelous short-cut to 
communication, if we could build 
up our own thought pulses. Maybe 
we could use the principle of the 
remote-control landing device which, 
as you know, can project hu- 
man thoughts on a simple, gross 
level, where ordinary energies get 
confused by the intense field needed 
for the landing.” 

What interested Lesbee in the

seemed to subside. '‘I heard you 
being named joint captain. You’re 
the boss. It shall be done.” 

Lesbee put down the closed-cir- 
cuit phone into which he had been 
talking, and turned. It was then he 
saw that the film was ready to roll, 
and that Browne had his fingers on 
the controls of the tractor beam. 
The older man stared at him ques- 
tioningly. 

“Shall I go ahead?” he asked. 

At this penultimate moment, Les- 
bee had a qualm. 

Almost immediately he realized 
that the only alternative to what 
Browne planned was that he reveal 
his own secret knowledge. 

He hesitated, torn by doubts. 
Then: “Will you turn that off?” He 
indicated the intercom. 

Browne said to the audience, 



“We’ll bring you in again on this 
in a minute, good people.” He broke 
the connection and gazed question- 
ingly at Lesbee. 

Whereupon Lesbee said in a low 
voice, “Captain, I should inform 
you that I brought the Karn aboard 
in the hope of using him against 
you.” 

“Well, that is a frank and open 
admission,” the officer replied very 
softly. 

“1 mention this,” said Lesbee, “be- 
cause if you had similar ulterior 
motives, we should clear the air 
completely before proceeding with 
this attempt at communication.” 

A blossom of color spread from 
Browne’s neck over his face. At last 
he said slowly, “I don’t know how 
I can convince you, but I had no 
schemes.” 



THE EXPENDABLES 



31 




Lesbcc gazed at Browne’s open 
countenance, and suddenly he real- 
ized that the officer was sincere, 
Browne had accepted the compro- 
mise. The solution of a joint cap- 
taincy was agreeable to him. 

Sitting there, Lcsbee experienced 
an enormous joy. Seconds went by 
before he realized what underlay 
the intense pleasurable excitement. 
It was simply the discovery that — 
communication worked. You could 
tell your truth and get a hearing . 
if it made sense. 

It seemed to him that his truth 
made a lot of sense. He was offer- 
ing Browne peace aboard the ship. 
Peace at a price, of course; but still 
peace. And in this severe emergency 
Browne recognized the entire valid- 
ity of the solution. 

So it was now evident to Lesbee. 

Without further hesitation he told 
Browne that the creatures who had 
boarded the lifeboat, were robots 
— not alive at all. 

B rowne was nodding thought- 
fully, Finally he said: “But I 
don’t see how this could be utilized 
to take over the ship.” 

Lesbee said patiently, “As you 
know, sir, the remote landing con- 
trol system includes five principal 
ideas which are projected very forc- 
ibly on the thought level. Three of 
these are for guidance — up, down 
and sideways. Intense magnetic 
fields, any one of which could par- 
tially jam a complex robot’s think- 
ing processes. The fourth and fifth 
are instructions to blast either up 
or down. The force of the blast de- 
pends on how far the control is 



turned on. Since the energy used ia 
overwhelming those simple com- 
mands would take pre-emption over 
the robot. When that first one 
came aboard the lifeboat, I had a 
scan receiver — nondetectable — 
on him. This registered two power 
sources, one pointing forward, one 
backward, from the chest level. 
That’s why I had him on his back 
when I brought him in here. But 
the fact is I could have had him 
tilted and pointing at a target, and 
activated either control four or five, 
thus destroying whatever was in the 
path of the resulting blast. Natural- 
ly, I took all possible precautions 
to make sure that this did not hap- 
pen until you had indicated what 
you intended to do. One of these 
precautions would enable us to 
catch this creature’s thoughts with- 
out — ” 

As he was speaking, he eagerly 
put his hand into his pocket, in- 
tending to show the older man the 
tiny on-off control device by which 
— when it was off — they would 
be able to read Dzing’s thoughts 
without removing him from the 
cage. 

He stopped short in his explana- 
tion, because an ugly expression had 
come suddenly into Browne’s face. 

The big man glanced at Third 
Officer Mindel. “Well, Dan,” he 
said, “do you think that’s it?” 

Lesbee noticed with shock that 
Mindel had on sound amplifying 
earphones. He must have overheard 
every word that Browne and he 
had spoken to each other. 

Mindel nodded. “Yes, Captain,” 
he said. “I very definitely think he 

IF 



22 




has now told us what we wanted to 
find out.” 

Lesbee grew aware that Browne 
had released himself from his ac- 
celeration safety belt and was step- 
ping away from his seat. The officer 
turned and, standing very straight, 
said in a formal tone: 

“Technician Lesbee, we have 
heard your admission of gross dere- 
liction of duty, conspiracy to over- 
throw the lawful government of 
this ship, scheme to utilize alien 
creatures to destroy human beings, 
and confession of other unspeak- 
able crimes. In this extremely dan- 
gerous situation, summary execu- 
tion without formal trial is justified. 
I therefore sentence you to death 
and order Third Officer Dan Min- 
del to — ” 

He faltered, and came to a stop. 

V 

T wo things had been happen- 
ing as he talked, Lesbee 
squeezed the “off” switch of the 
cage control, an entirely automatic 
gesture, convulsive, a spasmodic 
movement, result of his dismay. It 
was a mindless gesture. So far as 
he knew consciously, freeing Dzing’s 
thoughts had no useful possibility 
for him. His only real hope — as 
he realized almost immediately — 
was to get his other hand into his 
remaining coat pocket and with it 
manipulate the remote-control land- 
ing device, the secret of which he 
had so naively revealed to Browne. 

The second thing that happened 
was that Dzing, released from men- 
tal control, telepathed: 



“Free again — and this time of 
course permanently! I have just now 
activated by remote control the re- 
lays that will in a few moments 
start the engines of this ship, and I 
have naturally re-set the mechanism 
for controlling the rate of accelera- 
tion — ” 

His thoughts must have impinged 
progressively on Browne, for it was 
at that point that the officer paused 
uncertainly. 

Dzing continued: “I verified your 
analysis. This vessel does not have 
the internal energy flows of an in- 
terstellar ship. These two-legged be- 
ings have therefore failed to achieve 
the Light Speed Effect which alone 
makes possible trans-light velocities. 
I suspect they have taken many 
generations to make this journey, 
are far indeed for their home base, 
and Fm sure I can capture them all.” 

Lesbee reached over, tripped on 
the intercom and yelled at the 
screen: “All stations prepare for 
emergency acceleration! Grab any- 
thing!” 

To Browne he shouted: “Get to 
your seat — quick!'* 

His actions were automatic re- 
sponses to danger. Only after the 
words were spoken did it occur to 
him that he had no interest in the 
survival of Captain Browne. And 
that in fact the only reason the man 
was in danger was because he had 
stepped away from his safety belt, 
so that Mindel’s blaster would kill 
Lesbee without damaging Browne. 

Browne evidently understood his 
danger. He started toward the con- 
trol chair from which he had re- 
leased himself only moments before. 



THE EXPENDABLES 



23 




His reaching hands were still a foot 
or more from it when the impact 
of Acceleration One stopped him. 
He stood there trembling like a man 
who had struck an invisible but pal- 
pable wall. The next instant Acceler- 
ation Two caught him and thrust 
him on his back to the floor. He be- 
gan to slide toward the rear of the 
room, faster and faster, and because 
he was quick and understanding he 
pressed the palms of his hands and 
his rubber shoes hard against the 
floor and so tried to slow the move- 
ment of his body. 

Lesbee was picturing other people 
elsewhere in the ship desperately 
trying to save themselves. He groan- 
ed, for the commander’s failure was 
probably being duplicated every- 
where. 

Even as he had that thought. Ac- 
celeration Three caught Browne. 
Like a rock propelled by a catapult 
he shot toward the rear wall. It 
was cushioned to protect human be- 
ings, and so it reacted like rubber, 
bouncing him a little. But the stuff 
had only momentary resilience. 

Acceleration Four pinned Browne 
halfway into the cushioned wall. 
From its imprisoning depths, he 
managed a strangled yell. 

“Lesbee, put a tractor beam on 
me! Save me! Pll make it up to you. 
1 — 

Acceleration Five choked off the 
words. 

The man’s appeal brought mo- 
mentary wonder to Lesbee. He was 
amazed that Browne hoped for 
mercy . , after what had happened, 

Browne’s anguished words did 
produce one effect in him. They re- 

24 



minded him that there was something 
he must do. He forced his hand and 
his arm to the control board and 
focussed a tractor beam that firmly 
captured Third Officer Mindel and 
the cameraman. His intense effort 
was barely in time. Acceleration fol- 
lowed acceleration, making move- 
ment impossible. The time between 
each surge of increased speed grew 
longer. The slow minutes lengthened 
into what seemed an hour, then 
many hours. Lesbee was held in his 
chair as if he were gripped by hands 
of steel. His eyes felt glassy; his 
body had long since lost all feeling. 

He noticed something. 

The rate of acceleration was dif- 
ferent from what the original Tellier 
had prescribed long ago. The actual 
increase in forward pressure each 
time was less. 

He realized something else. For 
a long time, no thoughts had come 
from the Karn. 

S uddenly, he felt an odd shift 
in speed, A physical sensation 
of slight, very slight, angular move- 
ment accompanied the maneuver. 

Slowly, the metal-like bands let 
go of his body. The numb feeling 
was replaced by the pricking as of 
thousands of tiny needles. Instead 
of muscle-compressing acceleration 
there was only a steady pressure. 

It was the pressure that he had 
in the past equated with gravity. 

Lesbee stirred hopefully, and 
when he felt himself move, realized 
what had happened. The artificial 
gravity had been shut off. Simulta- 
neously, the ship had made a half 
turn within its outer shell. The drive

power was now coming from below, 
a constant one gravity thrust. 

At this late, late moment, ha 
plunged his hand into the pocket 
which held the remote control for 
the pilotless landing mechanism — 
and activated it. 

‘That ought to turn on his 
thoughts,’’ he told himself savagely. 

But if Dzing was telepathing to his 
masters, it was no longer on the 
human thought level. So Lesbee 
concluded unhappily. 

The ether was silent. 

He now grew aware of something 
more. The ship smelled different: 
better, cleaner, purer. 

Lesbee’s gaze snapped over to the 
speed dials on the control board. 
The figures registering there were 
unbelievable. They indicated that 
the spaceship was traveling at a 
solid fraction of the speed of light. 

Lesbee stared at the numbers in- 
credulously. “We didn’t have time!” 
he thought. “How could we go so 
fast so quickly — in hours only to 
near the speed of light!” 

Sitting there, breathing hard, 
fighting to recover from the effects 
of that prolonged speed-up, he felt 
the fantastic reality of the universe. 
During all this slow century of flight 
through space, the Hope of Man had 
had the potential for this vastly great- 
er velocity. 

He visualized the acceleration 
series so expertly programmed by 
Dzing as having achieved a shift to 
a new state of matter in motion. 
The “light speed effect,” the Karn 
robot had called it. 

“And Tellier missed it,” he 
thought. 



All those experiments the physi- 
cist had performed so painstakingly, 
and left a record of, had missed the 
great discovery. 

Missed it! And so a shipload of 
human beings had wandered for 
generations through the black deeps 
of interstellar space. 

A cross the room Browne was 
climbing groggily to his feet. 
He muttered, “. Better get back to 
. control chair.” 

He had taken only a few uncer- 
tain steps when a realization seemed 
to strike him. He looked up then, 
and stared wildly at Lesbee. “Oh!” 
he said. The sound came from the 
gut level, a gasp of horrified under- 
standing. 

As he slapped a complex of trac- 
tor beams on Browne, Lesbee said, 
“That’s right, you’re looking at your 
enemy. Better start talking. We 
haven’t much time.” 

Browne was pale now. But his 
mouth had been left free and so he 
was able to say huskily, “I did what 
any lawful government does in an 
emergency. I dealt with treason 
summarily, taking time only to find 
out what it consisted of.” 

Lesbee had had another thought, 
this time about Miller on the bridge. 
Hastily, he swung Browne over in 
front of him. “Hand me your blas- 
ter,” he said. “Stock first.” 

He freed the other’s arm, so that 
he could reach into the holster and 
take it out. 

Lesbee felt a lot better when he 
had the weapon. But still another 
idea had come to him. He said 
harshly, “I want to lift you over to 

25 



THE EXPENDABLES 




the cage, and I don’t want First 
Officer Miller to interfer. Get that, 
Mister Miller!” 

There was no answer from the 
screen. 

Browne said uneasily, ‘‘Why over 
to the cage?” 

Lesbee did not answer right away. 
Silently he manipulated the tractor 
beam control until Browne was in 
position. Having gotten him there, 
Lesbee hesitated. What bothered 
him was, why had the Karn’s 
thought impulses ceased? He had 
an awful feeling that something was 
very wrong indeed. 

He gulped, and said, “Raise the 
lid!” 

Again, he freed Browne’s arm. 
The big man reached over gingerly, 
unfastened the catch, and then drew 
back and glanced questioningly at 
Lesbee. 

“Look inside!” Lesbee command- 
ed. 

Browne said scathingly, “You 
don’t think for one second that — ” 
He stopped, for he was peering into 
the cage. He uttered a cry: “He’s 
gone!” 

VI 

L esbee discussed the disappearance 
with Browne. 

It was an abrupt decision on his 
part to do so. The question of where 
Dzing might have got to was not 
•omething he should merely turn 
over in his own head. 

He began by pointing at the dials 
from which the immense speed of 
the ship could be computed, and 
then, when that meaning was ab- 

26 



sorbed by the older man, said 
simply, “What happened? Where did 
he go? And how could we speed up 
to just under 186,000 miles a sec- 
ond in so short a time?” 

He had lowered the big man to 
the floor, and now he took some of 
the tension from the tractor beam 
but did not release the power. 
Browne stood in apparent deep 
thought. Finally, he nodded. “All 
right,” he said, “I know what hap- 
pened.” 

“Tell me.” 

Browne changed the subject, said 
in a deliberate tone, “What are you 
going to do with me?” 

Lesbee stared at him for a mo- 
ment unbelievingly. “You’re going to 
withhold this information?” he de- 
manded. 

Browne spread his hands. “What 
else can I do? Till 1 know my fate, 
I have nothing to lose.” 

Lesbee suppressed a strong im- 
pulse to rush over and strike his 
pri.soner. He said finally, “In your 
judgment is this delay dangerous?” 
Browne was silent, but a bead of 
sweat trickled down his cheek. “/ 
have nothing to lose,” he repeated. 

The expression in Lesbee’s face 
must have alarmed him, for he went 
on quickly, “Look, there’s no need 
for you to conspire any more. What 
you really want is to go home, isn’t 
it? Don’t you see, with this new 
method of acceleration, we can 
make it to Earth in a few months!^ 
He stopped. He seemed momen- 
tarily uncertain. 

Lesbee snapped angrily, “Who are 
you trying to fool? Months! We’re 
a dozen light years in actual distance 

IF 




from Earth. You mean years, not 
months.” 

Browne hesitated then: “All right, 
a few years. But at least not a life- 
time. So if you’ll promise not to 
scheme against me further. I’ll 
promise — ” 

“Youll promise!” Lesbee spoke 
savagely. He had been taken aback 
by Browne’s instant attempt at 
blackmail. But the momentary sense 
of defeat was gone. He knew with 
a stubborn rage that he would stand 
for no nonsense. 

He said in an uncompromising 
voice, “Mister Browne, twenty sec- 
onds after I stop speaking, you start 
talking. If you don’t, I’ll batter you 
against these walls. I mean it!” 

Browne was pale. “Are you going 
to kill me? That’s all I want to know. 
Look — ” his tone was urgent — 
“we don’t have to fight any more. 
We can go home. Don’t you sec? 
The long madness is just about over. 
Nobody has to die.” 

Lesbee hesitated. What the big 
man said was at least partly true. 
There was an attempt here to make 
twelve years sound like twelve days, 
or at most twelve weeks. But the 
fact was, it was a short period com- 
pared to the century-long journey 
which, at one time, had been the 
only possibility. 

H e thought: “Am I going to 
kill him?” 

It was hard to believe that he 
would, under the circumstances. All 
right. If not death, then what? He 
sat there uncertain. The vital sec- 
onds went by, and he could see no 
solution. He thought finaUy, in des- 



peration: “Fll have to give in for 
the moment. Even a minute think- 
ing about this is absolutely crazy.” 

He said aloud in utter frustration, 
“I’ll promise you this. If you can 
figure out how I can feci safe in a 
ship commanded by you I’ll give 
your plan consideration. And now, 
mister, start talking.” 

Browne nodded. “I accept that 
promise,” he said, “What we’ve run 
into here is the Lorenz-Fitzgerald 
Contraction Theory. Only it’s not 
a theory any more. We’re living the 
reality of it.” 

Lesbee argued, “But it only took 
us a few hours to get to the speed 
of light.” 

Browne said, “As we approach 
light speed, space foreshortens and 
time compresses. What seemed like 
a few hours would be days in nor- 
mal time and space.” 

What Browne explained then was 
different rather than difficult. Les- 
bee had to blink his mind to shut 
out the glare of his old ideas and 
habits of thought, so that the more 
subtle shades of super-speed phe- 
nomena could shine through into 
his awareness. 

The time compression — as 
Browne explained it — was grada- 
tional. The rapid initial series of ac- 
celerations were obviously designed 
to pin down the personnel of the 
ship. Subsequent increments would 
be according to what was necessary 
to attain the ultra-speed finally 
achieved. 

Since the drive was still on, it 
was clear that some resistance was 
being encountered, perhaps from 
the fabric of space itself. 



THE EXPENDABLES 



27 




It was no time to discuss techni- 
cal details. Lesbee accepted the re- 
markable reality and said quickly, 
“Yes, but where is Dzing?” 

“My guess,” said Browne, “is that 
he did not come along.” 

“How do you mean?” 

“The space-time foreshortening 
did not affect him.” 

“But — ” Lesbee began blankly. 
“Look,” said Browne harshly, 
“don’t ask me how he did it. My 
picture is, he stayed in the cage till 
after the acceleration stopped. Then, 
in a leisurely fashion, he released 
himself from the electrically locked 
manacles, climbed out, and went off 
to some other part of the ship. He 
wouldn’t have to hurry since by this 
time he was operating at a rate of, 
say, five hundred times faster than 
our living pace.” 

Lesbee said, “But that means he’s 
been out there for hours — his time. 
What’s he been up to?” 

Browne admitted that he had no 
answer for that. 

“But you can see,” he pointed out 
anxiously, “that I meant what I said 
about going back to Earth. We have 
no business in this part of space. 
These beings are far ahead of us 
scientifically.” 

His purpose was obviously to per- 
suade. Lesbee thought: “He’s back 
to our fight. That’s more important 
to him than any damage the real 
enemy is causing.” 

A vague recollection came of the 
things he had read about the strug- 
gle for power throughout Earth his- 
tory. How men intrigued for su- 
premacy while vast hordes of the 
invader battered down the gates. 



Browne was a true spiritual descend- 
ant of all those mad people. 

Slowly, Lesbee turned and faced 
the big board. What was baffling to 
him was, what could you do against 
a being who moved five hundred 
times as fast as you did? 

VII 

H e had a sudden sense of awe, 
a picture ... At any given in- 
stant Dzing was a blur. A spot of 
light. A movement so rapid that, 
even as the gaze lighted on him, he 
was gone to the other end of the 
ship — and back. 

Yet Lesbee knew it took time to 
traverse the great ship from end to 
end. Twenty, even twenty-five min- 
utes, was normal walking time for 
a human being going along the cor- 
ridor known as Center A. 

It would take the Karn a full six 
seconds there and back. In its way 
that was a significant span of time, 
but after Lesbee had considered it 
for a moment he felt appalled. 

What could they do against a 
creature who had so great a time 
differential in his favor? 

From behind him, Browne said, 
“Why don’t you use against him that 
remote landing control system that 
you set up with my permission?” 
Lesbee confessed: “I did that, as 
soon as the acceleration ceased. But 
he must have been — back — in 
the faster time by then.” 

“That wouldn’t make any differ- 
ence,” said Browne. 

“Eh!” Lesbee was startled. 
Browne parted his lips evidently 
intending to explain, and then he 

IF 



28 




closed them again. Finally he said, 
“Make sure the intercom is off.” 
Lesbee did so. But he was real- 
izing that Browne was up to some- 
thing again. He said, and there was 
rage in his lone, “I don’t get it, and 
you do. Is that right.” 

“Yes,” said Browne. He spoke de- 
liberately, but he was visibly sup- 
pressing excitement. “I know how 
to defeat this creature. That puts 
me in a bargaining position.” 
Lesbee’s eyes were narrowed to 
slits. “Damn you, no bargain. Tell 
me, or else!” 

Browne said, “I’m not really try- 
ing to be difficult. You either have 
to kill me, or come to some agree- 
ment. I want to know what that 
agreement is, because of course I’ll 
do it.” 

Lesbee said, “I think we ought to 
have an election.” 

“I agree!” Browne spoke instantly. 
“You set it up.” He broke off. “And 
now release me from these tractors 
and I’ll show you the neatest space- 
time trick you’ve ever seen, and 
that’ll be the end of Dzing.” 

Lesbee gazed at the man’s face, 
saw there the same openness of 
countenance, the same h mk honest 
that had preceded the execution or- 
der, and he thought, “What can he 
do?” 

He considered many possibilities, 
and thought finally, desperately: 
“He’s got the advantage over me of 
superior knowledge — the most un- 
defeatable weapon in the world. The 
only thing I can really hope to use 
against it in the final issue is my 
knowledge of a multitude of techni- 
cian-level details.” 



But — what could Browne do 
against Lesbee? 

He said unhappily to the other, 
“Bcfo.re I free you, I want to lift 
you over to Mindel. When I do, 
you get his blaster for me.” 

“Sure,” said Browne casually. 

A few moments later he handed 
Mindel’s gun over to Lesbee. So that 
wasn’t it. 

Lesbee thought: “There’s Miller 
on the bridge — can it be that 
Miller flashed him a ready signal 
when my back was turned to the 
board?” 

Perhaps, like Browne, Miller had 
been temporarily incapacitated dur- 
ing the period of acceleration. It 
was vital that he find out Miller’s 
present capability. 

L esbee tripped the intercom be- 
tween the two boards. The 
rugged, lined face of the first of- 
ficer showed large on the screen. 
Lesbee could see the outlines of 
the bridge behind the man and, be- 
yond, the starry blackness of space. 
Lesbee said courteously, “Mr. Mil- 
ler, how did you make out during 
the acceleration?” 

“It caught me by surprise, Cap- 
tain. I really got a battering. I think 
I was out for a while. But I’m all 
right now.” 

“Good,” said Lesbee. “As you 
probably heard. Captain Brownu 
and I have come to an agreement, 
and we are now going to destroy 
the creature that is loose on tho 
ship. Stand by!” 

Cynically, he broke the connec- 
tion. 

Miller was there all right, wait- 



THE EXPENDABLES 



29 




ing. But the question was still, what 
could Miller do? The answer of 
course was that Miller could pre- 
empt. And — Lesbee asked himself 
— what could that do? 

Abruptly, it seemed to him, he 
had the answer. 

It was the technician’s answer 
that he had been mentally straining 
for. 

He now understood Browne’s 
plan. They were waiting for Lesbee 
to let down his guard for a mo- 
ment. Then Miller would pre-empt, 
cut off the tractor beam from 
Browne and seize Lesbee with it. 

For the two officers it was vital 
that Lesbee not have time to fire 
the blaster at Browne. Lesbee 
thought: ‘Tt’s the only thing they 
can be worried about. The truth is, 
there’s nothing else to stop them.” 

The solution was, Lesbee realized 
with a savage glee, to let the two 
men achieve their desire. But first — 

*‘Mr. Browne,” he said quietly, “T 
think you should give your informa- 
tion If I agree that it is indeed the 
correct solution, I shall release you 
and we shall have an election. You 
and I will stay right here till the 
election is over.” 

Browne said, ‘T accept your 
promise. The speed of light is a 
constant, and does not change in 
relation to moving objects. That 
would also apply to electromagnetic 
fields.” 

Lesbee said, *^Then Dzing was af- 
fected by the remote-control device 
I turned on.” 

“Instantly,” said Browne. “Ho 
never got a chance to do anything. 
How much power did you use?” 



“Only first stage,” said Lesbee. 
“But the machine-driven thought 
pulses in that would interfere with 
just about every magnetic field in 
his body. He couldn’t do another 
coherent thing.” 

Browne said in a hushed tone, 
“It’s got to be. He’ll be out of con- 
trol in one of the corridors, com- 
pletely at our mercy.” He grinned. 
‘T told you I knew how to defeat 
him — because, of course, he was 
already defeated.” 

Lesbee considered that for a long 
moment, eyes narrowed. He real- 
ized that he accepted the explana- 
tion, but that he had preparations 
to make, and quickly — before 
Browne got suspicious of his delay. 

He turned to the board and 
switched on the intercom. “People,” 
he said, “strap yourselves in again. 
Help those who were injured to do 
the same. We may have another 
emergency. You have several min- 
utes, I think, but don’t waste any 
of them.” 

He cut off the intercom, and he 
activated the closed-circuit inter- 
com of the technical stations. He 
said urgently, “Special instruction to 
Technical personnel. Report any- 
thing unusual, particularly if strange 
thought forms are going through 
your mind.” 

He had an answer to th^t within 
moments after he finished speaking. 
A man’s twangy voice came over: 
“I keep thinking I’m somebody 
named Dzing, and I’m trying to re- 
port to my owners. Boy, am I in- 
coherent!” 

“Where is this?” 

“D — 4 — 19 ” 



30 



IF 




Lesbee punched the buttons that 
gave them a TV view of that parti- 
cular ship location. Almost immedi- 
ately he spotted a shimmer near the 
floor. 

After a moment’s survey he or- 
dered a heavy-duty mobile blaster 
brought to the corridor. By the time 
its colossal energies ceased, Dzing 
was only a darkened area on the 
flat surface. 

A^^hile these events were pro- 
^ ^ gressing, Lesbee had kept one 
eye on Browne and Mindel’s blaster 
firmly gripped in his left hand. Now 
he said, “Well, sir, you certainly did 
what you promised. Wait a moment 
while T put this gun away, and then 
I’ll carry out my part of the bar- 
gain.” 

He started to do so, then, out of 
pitv, paused. 

He had been thinking in the back 
of his mind about what Browne had 
said earlier: that the trip to Earth 
might only take a few months. The 
officer had backed away from that 
statement, but it had been bothering 
Lesbee ever since. 

If it were true, then it was indeed 
a fact that nobody need die! 

He said quickly, “What was your 
reason for saying that the journey 
home would only take — well — 
less than a year?” 

“It’s the tremendous time com- 
pression,” Browne explained eager- 
ly. “The distance as you pointed out 
is over 12 light-years. But with a 
time ratio of 3, 4, or 500 to one, we’ll 
make it in less than a month. When 
I first started to say that, I could 
see that the figures were incompre- 

THE EXPENDABLES 



hensible to you in your tense mood. 
In fact, I could scarcely believe 
them myself.” 

Lesbee said, staggered, “We can 
get back to Earth in a couple of 
weeks — my God!” He broke off, 
said urgently, “Look, I accept you 
as commander. We don’t need an 
election. The status quo is good 
enough for any short period of 
time. Do you agree?” 

“Of course,” said Browne. “That’s 
the point I’ve been trying to make.” 

As he spoke, his face was utterly 
guileless. 

Lesbee gazed at that mask of 
innocence, and he thought hopeless^ 
ly: “What’s wrong? Why isn’t he 
really agreeing? Is it because he 
doesn’t want to lose his command 
so quickly?” 

Sitting there, unhappily fighting 
for the other’s life, he tried to place 
himself mentally in the position of 
the commander of a vessel, tried to 
look at the prospect of a return to 
view. It was hard to picture such i 
reality. But presently it seemed to 
him that he understood. 

He said gently, feeling his way, 
“It would be kind of a shame to 
return without having made a suc- 
cessful landing anywhere. With thii 
new speed, we could visit a dozen 
sun systems, and still get home in 
a year.” 

The look that came into Browne’s 
face for a fleeting moment told Les- 
bee that he had penetrated to the 
thought in the man’s mind. 

The next instant, Browne was 
shaking his head vigorously. “This 
is no time for side excursions,” ho 
said. “We’ll leave explorations of 

31 




new star systems to future expedi- 
tions. The people of this ship have 
served their term. We go straight 
home,” 

Browne’s face was now complete- 
ly relaxed. His blue eyes shone with 
truth and sincerity. 

There was nothing further that 
Lesbee could say. The gulf between 
Browne and himself could not be 
bridged. 

The commander had to kill hia 
rival, so that he might finally return 
to Earth and report that the mission 
of the Hope of Man was accom- 
plished. 

VIII 

I n the most deliberate fashion 
Lesbee shoved the blaster into 
the inner pocket of his coat. Then, 
as if he were being careful, he used 
the tractor beam to push Browne 
about four feet away. There he set 
him down, released him from the 
beam, and — with the same delib- 
erateness — drew his hand away 
from the tractor controls. Thus he 
made himself completely defense- 
less. 

It was the moment of vulnerabil- 
ity. 

Browne leaped at him, yelling: 
‘^Miller — pre-emptl” 

First Officer Miller obeyed the 
command of his captain. 

What happened then, only Les- 
bee, the technician with a thousand 
bits of detailed knowledge, expected. 

For years it had been observed 
that when Control Room Below 
took over from Bridge, the ship 
speeded up slightly. And when 



Bridge took over from Control 
Room Below, the ship slowed in- 
stantly by the same amount — in 
each instance, something less than 
half a mile an hour. 

The two boards were not com- 
pletely synchronized. The techni- 
cians often joked about it, and Les- 
bee had once read an obscure tech- 
nical explanation for the discrep- 
ancy. It had to do with the impos- 
sibility of ever getting two metals 
refined to the same precision of in- 
ternal structure. 

It was the age-old story of, no 
two objects in the universe are alike. 
But in times past, the differential 
had meant nothing. It was a techni- 
cal curiosity, an interesting phenom- 
enon of the science of metallurgy, 
a practical problem that caused 
machinists to curse good-naturedly 
when technicians like Lesbee re- 
quired them to make a replacement 
part. 

Unfortunately for Browne, the 
ship was now traveling near the 
speed of light. 

His strong hands, reaching to- 
wards Lesbee’s slighter body, were 
actually touching the latter’s arm 
when the momentary deceleration 
occured as Bridge took over. The 
sudden slow-down was at a much 
faster rate than even Lesbee expect- 
ed. The resistance of space to the 
forward movement of the ship must 
be using up more engine power than 
he had realized; it was taking a lot 
of thrust to maintain a one gravity 
acceleration. 

The great vessel slowed about 
150 miles per hour in the space of 
a second. 



32 



IF 




Lesbee took the blow of that de- 
celeration partly against his back, 
partly against one side — for he 
had half-turned to defend himself 
from the bigger man’s attack. 

Browne, who had nothing to 
grab on to, was flung forward at 
the full 150 miles per hour. He 
struck the control board with an 
audible thud, stuck to it as if he 
were glued there; and then, when 
the adjustment was over — when 
the Hope of Man was again speed- 
ing along at one gravity — his body 
slid down the face of the board, and 
crumpled into a twisted position on 
the rubberized dais. 

His uniform was discolored. As 
Lesbee watched, blood seeped 
through and dripped to the floor. 

4 C A re you going to hold an 
election?” Tellier asked. 

The big ship had turned back 
under Lesbee’s command, and had 
picked up his friends. The lifeboat 
itself, with the remaining Karn still 
aboard, was put into an orbit around 
Alta III and abandoned. 

The two young men were sitting 
now in the Captain’s cabin. 

After the question was asked, Les- 
bee leaned back in his chair, and 
closed his eyes. He didn’t need to 
examine his total resistance to the 
suggestion. He had already savored 
the feeling that command brought. 

Almost from the moment of 
Browne’s death, he had observed 
himself having the same thoughts 
that Browne had voiced — among 
many others, the reasons why elec- 



tions were not advisable aboard a 
spaceship. He waited now while 
Eleesa, one of his three wives — 
she being the younger of the two 
young widows of Browne — poured 
wine for them, and went softly out. 
Then he laughed grimly. 

“My good friend,” he said, “we’re 
all lucky that time is so compressed 
at the speed of light. At 500-timea 
compression, any further explora- 
tion we do will require only a few 
months, or years at most. And so I 
don’t think we can afford to take 
the chance of defeating at an elec- 
tion the only person who under- 
stands the details of the new ac- 
celeration method. Until I decide 
exactly how much exploration we 
shall do, I shall keep our speed 
capabilities a secret. But I did, and 
do, think one other person should 
know where I have this information 
documented. Naturally, I selected 
First Officer Tellier.” 

“Thank you, sir,” the youth said. 
But he was visibly thoughtful as he 
sipped his wine. He went on final- 
ly, “Captain, I think you’d feel a lot 
better if you held an election. I’m 
sure you could win it.” 

Lesbee laughed tolerantly, shook 
his head. “I’m afraid you don’t un- 
derstand the dynamics of govern- 
ment,” he said. “There’s no record 
in history of a person who actually 
had control, handing it over.” 

He finished with the casual con- 
fidence of absolute power. “I’m not 
going to be presumptuous enough 
to fight a precedent like that!”

Automatically he looked for a

bucking ship for it. The jolt of the 
landing triggered the ejector seat 
and in a second he was hurtling 
through the air away from the ex- 
plosion of the damaged vehicle. 
Just before he blacked out, he 
thought — almost calmly — “a good 
hundred and fifty miles from the 
colony.” 



When he regained consciousness, 
night was passing and the first of 
the three suns was peeking over the 
horizon. Curt lay still for a while, 
afraid to find out what might be 
wrong with him. And the rescue 
ship could take anything from an 
hour to a week to find him. He moved 
his head to discover if there might 
be anything left of his ship; he saw 
nothing but pieces. 

“Well,” he said aloud, “so much 
for that.” He reached back gingerly 
and undid the seat straps. Carefufly,

he sat up and began to ease his 
weight onto his feet. A sharp twinge 
of pain in his knee dropped him back 
to a silling position. He probed at 
the knee but found no broken bones. 

“Well,” he said again, quietly. The 
colony leaders had had very little 
to offer in the way of survival. Rule 
number 1 : Mark the crash site and 
your direction of travel. Number 2: 
Get into shade before the combined 
heat of the three suns boils your 
blood. Number 3: Carry your pistol 
for protection against liquitl scorpi- 
ons, and always save the iast pellet 
for yourself. 

Curt glanced about nervously at 
the thoucht of the liquid scorpions 
■ — the one form of animal life the 
colonist had found on this mineral- 
rich planet. Liquid scorpions were 
enormous masses of clear, icllyi'ih 
liquid that oozed forward across the 
rock and sand with rernarkahde 
speed. A liquid scorpion changed 
shape conshuitly, its mass shooting 
out legs wherever they were needed. 
Only the eyes, fixed in a bulge over 
the center of its mass, and the al- 
most-sclid, curved stinger that arch- 
ed over its back remained the same. 

The first landing party had stood 
transfi.xed while one of the crew 
was attacked and absorbed before 
their eyes. Clear, the scorpion had 
been almost invisible to them until 
it flowed about the navigator’s legs 
and paralyzed him with the swaying 
stinger. When his frantic struggles 
had ceased, the creature flowed 
over his body and absorbed it. As 
the party watched, the clearness 
slowly became a thin, dark red, and 
the body could no longer be seen. 



Avengers had poured out of the 
ship after the giant scorpion, which 
reared back, tripling its height and 
halving its width. At the apex, the 
two protuding eyes bulged at them 
and the stinger swayed back and 
forth, reaching out and retreating. 
Explosive pellets fired into itr flesh 
were absorbed with a slurping 
sound. The captain in the end, had 
knelt and taken careful aim at the 
right eye, behind which was the 
only unreddened sector of the mass. 
Wten the right eye disappeared, the 
clear area spurted out of the hole and 
drained over the jelly-like surface. 
Slowly, silently, the first of the 
liquid scorpions died. 

Curt counted the pellets in his 
belt — an even hundred. Enough . 
if he managed to keep out of sight 
and had good enough aim. He sur- 
veyed the surrounding countryside. 
Farlher along the valley were 
shaded caves v/herc he could find 
protection once he had marked his 
course. 

If he could walk that far. 

X en came sluggishly awake, 
feeling the warmth penetrate 
his mass. The time of heat had come 
again, the time to search for what 
would halt the hunger that ached 
through every inch of him. 

Slowly, his cold -stiffened mass 
flowed forward from its hiding 
place in the warmth-holding sand. 
The heat melted the stiffness out 
of him and he began to slide across 
the sand, his alert senses functioning 
again. Sense of touch led him 
across rocks and over ridges easily. 
The touchy sense of vibration wait- 



THE TIME OF COLD 



35 




ed apprehensively for movement 
that would shake the ground. And 
the third sense, the one that could 
be called only “sense” or “sense of 
knowing,” functioned as always 
without his understanding. Today, 
this third sense told Xen, was dif- 
ferent from other days. 

Extra-cautious, Xen oozed over 
rocky barriers in the direction that 
his “sense” told him held food. Once 
he felt a slight tremor, and in terror 
flooded out over the rock into thin, 
transparent nothing. He waited sev- 
eral degrees of heat, but no further 
movement touched the sensitive re- 
ceivers in his mass. 

A falling rock, he decided, col- 
lecting himself and starting forward 
again. He slithered down rocky 
walls, pouring almost like water 
when the drop was long and draw- 
ing together at the bottom. When 
his feeling of touch warned him of 
the shade whose coolness might 
solidify him and leave him helpless 
in the open, he drew hurriedly away 
and changed direction. 

Finally, he reached an open spot 
that was likely to contain food. His 
mass ached for something to con- 
sume, but he flooded himself thin 
again and waited, feeling. There was 
no vibration through the surface, 
nor did his “sense” tell him of any- 
thing other than the possibility of 
nourishment. Xen hesitated only a 
degree of heat before bubbling ex- 
citedly into the open space. 

Touch found him something edi- 
ble almost immediately — he flowed 
around and over it, absorbing it 
hungrily. His mass dissolved it al- 
most immediately and ached for 

36 



more. He slid thin, reaching out in 
every direction until contact was 
made, then absorbing the food in- 
stantly and moving on. 

Curt, lying in meager shade that 
would be gone in half an hour when 
the third and largest sun rose, first 
saw the movement when it was on 
the rocks. His already frayed nerves 
gave a frightened leap. He lay per- 
fectly still. Where he had seen the 
movement on the rocky shelf there 
was now nothing. 

The nothing moved forward. 

Curt shivered. He was certain he 
was seeing nothing, and yet his eyes 
were trying to tell him there was 
movement. When it reached the flat 
place and flowed swiftly forward, 
he realized that it was a liquid ani- 
mal and was suddenly pointedly 
conscious of the weight of the pis- 
tol against his hip. 

He watched carefully for the eyes 
and the stinger, but saw none. That 
frightened him. If he could not find 
the brain, he had no mark to shoot 
at. As he watched, the liquid crea- 
ture flowed against one of the 
hardy, sun-browned plants and jerk- 
ed in reaction. Instantly, it flowed 
over the plant and absorbed it. The 
Uifoid turned naomentarily a thin 
brownish green and then cleared 
again. 

Curt watched it with narrowed 
eyes. It was just possible that this 
creature ate only plant life. The 
colonists had realized that the liquid 
scorpions had fed upon something 
else before they arrived, but no one 
had been able to discover what that 
something was. 



IF 




X en was in the process of 
absorbing a plant when the 
vibration sense alerted him. Terror 
shot through him and he spread 
thinly across thirty feet of ground 
and lay motionless, his “sense” telling 
him frantically that a Sting was 
hunting nearby. 

He lay for many degrees of heat, 
waiting. Sense of vibration and 
knowing both told him that the 
Sting was approaching, but uncer- 
tainly, searching. Then both senses 
reacted startledly to a new danger 
on the other side. New movement! 
A new’ feeling that his “sense” could 
not understand. 

The Sting was approaching at an 
angle that would inevitably bring it 
in contact with Xen. Absorption 
was the penalty for being caught. 
Xen was resigned to death, for he 
could not possibly escape the Sting. 
And now there was this new sensa- 
tion on the other side of him. What- 
ever it was, he had no idea; but like- 
ly it was as voracious as the Sting. 

Now the new thing vibrated jerk- 
ily around him and stopped between 
him and the Sting. The vibrations 
from the eager Sting accelerated 
rapidly, eagerly, as it flowed over 
the ground. Then, for no reason 
except that the new creature had 
moved slightly, the Sting recoiled. 
The jerks were plainly recorded 
through the earth to Xen; and as 
he felt the heavy jar, his “sense” 
told him that the danger from the 
Sting was past. The Sting was dead. 

Xen drew himself together and 
considered that. 

The new thing vibrated jerkily 
the place from which Xen had first 



felt it move. It must be solid as the 
rocks to move so jerkily, Xen 
thought. The Sting-killer drew it- 
self back under the enormous rock 
and ceased to move. 

Curiosity drew Xen forward, fear 
dragged him back. He spread thin 
and drew together with uncertainty. 
At last, he oozed forward carefully 
until he reached the rock. The Sting- 
killer was pressed back under the 
rock, where touch told Xen a tiny 
amount of the cold-carrying shade 
remained. Xen puzzled at that. Why 
should this creature hide from the 
life-giving suns? 

He reached out and absorbed a 
plant thoughtfully. This thing was 
different from the liquid structures 
he had always known. If it was 
solid where they were liquid, per- 
haps then it was also opposite in its 
needs. Maybe this Sting-killer 
needed cold instead of heat. 

While Xen was considering this 
difficult thought, the Sting-kDler be- 
gan to move again. 

C urt gasped. The shade was 
gone. The third sun was 
reaching long rays under the rock 
to sear his already-burned flesh. He 
had to find more shade. 

Movements were very painful. 
His lips were cracking and his face 
had blackened. The injured knee 
had swollen inside the protective 
suit; it throbbed and ached. Dazed- 
ly, he pulled himself to his feet. 

On the rock beside him, spread 
an inch thick, was the almost-in- 
visible creature he had been forced 
to circle in order to stop the liquid 
scorpion. He wondered tiredly if it 



THE TIME OF COLD 



37 




was dangerous. It lay completely 
motionless, just as it had when the 
liquid scorpion had approached. So 
it was probably more afraid of him 
than he was of it. He turned away. 
There appeared to be shade down 
the valley — perhaps a mile, per- 
haps three. Too much for him, he 
knew, but he set out, feeling the 
sun beat cruelly at him, crying out 
when the pain in his knee forced 
him to catch his balance against 
the sun-heated rock. 

He knew without turning that the 
liquid creature was following him, 
stopping when he stopped, starting 
when he started. When he knew he 
could go no farther and felt his 
knee give weakly to his weight, he 
saw it ooze forward and began to 
flow over his legs. He tried to reach 
his pistol, but it seemed so far away. 

X en, following the Sting-killer 
curiously, put together all that 
he had learned. This creature was 
different from himself. It needed 
shade. It had killed his enemy, which 
was possibly also its own enemy. 
Now it was trying to reach the 
shade, but its progress grew steadily 
slower. 

He considered that progress. The 
only thing he could liken it to was 
one of his own kind, caught out in 
the time of cold, trying to reach the 
heat-retaining sands, slowly con- 
gealing into a solid mass and dying. 
This, then, was the reverse process. 
Perhaps the Sting-killer would be- 
come liquid after a certain degree 
of heat. 

Xen’s sense of knowing warned 
him gently about too much wander- 



ing in the open, where countless 
Stings could be hiding. He drew 
back, unwilling to stop following 
this interesting creature. The Sting- 
killer vibrated the ground and lay 
still suddenly. Xen waited for a 
‘‘sense” of death but none came. This 
might be for the new thing a stage 
similar to that when one of Xen’s 
own kind became unable to move 
from the cold, but still lived and 
feared. 

Caught between his own fear and 
a very strange sensation that he 
could not interpret, Xen waited a 
degree of heat. Then he oozed for- 
ward and spread himself over the 
still shape, until it floated within him. 
When he flowed over one part, the 
thing struggled pitiably. Xen drew 
back startedly and the movement 
ceased. Carefully, he retraced his 
course, leaving the part free. This 
time there was no struggling. 

Spurred by fear of Stings, Xen 
began to flow across the land, letting 
his “Sense” guide him to the cold- 
ness. He slithered up slopes, poured 
over steep drops, always collecting 
himself in time to catch his burden. 

He found a place that would stay 
cold until the next time of heat and 
halted in front of it, his anxiety 
evident in the way he spread and 
collected himself, back and forth. 
At last he inched forward, feeling 
the agony of the cold bite into 
every cell. Bunching himself behind 
the Sting-killer, he made it flow 
along him until it broke free and 
lay upon the shaded rock. Xen drew 
back as hurriedly as his already- 
sluggish mass would allow. He 
spread thin across the earth and let 

IF 



38 




the heat liquefy his body again... 

It was when the time of cold was 
only a few degrees away that Xen 
felt the heavy vibration which near- 
ly made him dissolve with fear. It 
lasted for a few degrees and then 
weakened and made only a small 
tremor. Now many smaller vibra- 
tions reached him, like many crea- 
tures moving about. The tremors 
spread out, moving slowly toward 
the rocky valley. 

Xen lay still trying to identify the 
vibrations. They were not those of 
Stings. As they approached, he rec- 
ognized them as resembling in great 
numbers the creature he had put 
upon the rock. 

/^urt imagined he heard voices, an 
incoherent babble of them. He 
struggled to sit up, but there was an 
incredible weight on his chest. 



‘‘Lie still,” a voice said clearly, 
and his mind echoed, ‘'Still . still 
. still. 

He struggled again. “Liquid,” ho 
croaked painfully, “liquid animal 
. liquid. .” The weight was still 
there. He heard one last voice say, 
“Poor guy, he must have run into 
scorpions.” 

Then he was lifted and it seemed 
as though the lifting would never 
cease. 

Xen waited until the small tremor 
was gone and the great vibration 
had roared and disappeared. He 
knew by the sense of emptiness that 
the Sting-killer had gone back to 
his own kind. For a moment he felt 
very alone, though he knew the sand 
was full of Xens. 

Slowly, he drew himself together. 
For the time of cold was but a few 
degrees away, and he must seek the 
warm sands. END

MANNERS 
AND CUSTOMS 
OF THE THRID 

BY MURRAY LEINSTER 

ILLUSTRATED BY MODEL 

The Thrid were the wisest 
creatures in space — they 
even said so themselvesl 



I 

T ^he real trouble was that Jor- 
genson saw things as a busi- 
ness man does. But also, and con- 
tradictorily, he saw them as right 
and just, or as wrong and intolerable. 
As a business man, he should have 
kept his mind on business and never 



bothered about Ganti. As a believer 
in right and wrong, it would have 
been wiser for him to have stayed 
off the planet Thriddar altogether. 
Thriddar was no place for him, any- 
how you look at it. On this particu- 
lar morning it was especially the 
wrong place for him to be trying 
to live and do business.

AAAKNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE THRID

He woke up thinking of Ganti, 
and in consequence he was in a 
bad mood right away. Most humans 
couldn’t take the sort of thing that 
went on on Thriddar. Most of them 
wanted to use missile weapons — 
which the Thrid did not use — to 
change the local social system. Most 
humans got off Thriddar — fasti 
And boiling mad. 

Jorgenson had stood it longer 
than most because in spite of their 
convictions he liked the Thrid. Their 
minds did do outside loops, and 
come up with intolerable convic- 
tions. But they were intelligent 
enough. They had steam-power and 
even steam-driven atmosphere fliers, 
but they didn’t have missile weapons 
and they did have a social system 
that humans simply couldn’t accept 
— even though it applied only to 
Thrid. The ordinary Thrid, with 
whom Jorgenson did business, 
weren’t bad people. It was the of- 
ficials who made him grind his 
teeth. And though it was his busi- 
ness only to run the trading post 
of the Rim Stars Trading Corpora- 
tion, sometimes he got fed up. 

This morning was especially be- 
yond the limit. There was a new 
Grand Panjandrum — the term was 
Jorgenson’s own for the supreme 
ruler over all the Thrid — and when 
Jorgenson finished his breakfast a 
high Thrid official waited in the 
trading-post compound. Around 
him clustered other Thrid, wearing 
the formal headgear that said they 
were Witnesses to an official act. 

Jorgenson went out, scowling, 
and exchanged the customary cere- 
monial greetings. Then the high of- 



ficial beamed at him and extracted 
a scroll from his voluminous gar- 
ments. Jorgenson saw the glint of 
gold and was suspicious at once. 
The words of a current Grand Pan- 
jandrum were always written in 
gold. If they didn’t get written in 
gold they didn’t get written at all; 
but it was too bad if anybody 
ignored any of them. 

The high official unrolled the 
scroll. The Thrid around him, wear- 
ing Witness hats, became utterly 
silent. The high official made a 
sound equivalent to clearing his 
throat. The stillness became death- 
like. 

“On this day,” intoned the high 
official, while the Witnesses listen- 
ed reverently, “on this day did 
Glen-U the Never-Mistaken, as 
have been his predecessors through- 
out the ages; — on this day did the 
Never-Mistaken Glen-U speak and 
say and observe a truth in the pres- 
ence of the governors and the rulers 
of the universe.” 

Jorgenson reflected sourly that 
the governors and the rulers of the 
universe were whoever happened 
to be within hearing of the Grand 
Panjandrum. They were not impos- 
ing. They were scared. Everybody 
is always scared under an absolute 
ruler, but the Grand Panjandrum 
was worse than that. He couldn’t 
make a mistake. Whatever he said 
had to be true, because he said it, 
and sometimes it had drastic results. 
But past Grand Panjandrums had 
spoken highly of the trading post. 
Jorgenson shouldn’t have much to 
worry about. He waited. He thought 
of Ganti. He scowled. 



42 



IF 




**The great and Never-Mistaken 
Glen-U,” intoned the official again, 
*‘in the presence of the governors 
and the rulers of the universe, did 
speak and say and observe that it 
is the desire of the Rim Star Trad- 
ing Corporation to present to him, 
the great and never-mistaken 
Glen-U, all of the present posses- 
sions of the said Rim Stars Trading 
Corporation, and thereafter to remit 
to him all moneys, goods, and bene- 
factions to and of the said Rim Stars 
Trading Corporation as they shall be 
received. The great and Never-Mis- 
taken Glen-U did further speak and 
say and observe that anyone hinder- 
ing this loyal and admirable gift 
must, by the operation of truth, 
vanish from sight and nevermore 
be seen face to face by any rational 
being.” 

The high official rolled up the 
scroll, while Jorgenson exploded in- 
side. 

A part of this was reaction 
as a business man. A part was 
recognition of all the intolerable 
things that the Thrid took as a mat- 
ter of course. If Jorgenson had re- 
acted solely as a business man he’d 
have swallowed it, departed on the 
next Rim Stars trading-ship — 
which would not have left any 
trade-goods behind — and left the 
Grand Panjandrum to realize what 
he had lost when no off-planet 
goods arrived on Thriddar. In time 
he’d speak and say and observe that 
he, out of his generosity, gave the 
loot back. Then the trading could 
resume. But Jorgenson didn’t feel 
only like a business man this mom- 

MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE THRID 



ing. He thought of Ganti, who was 
a particular case of everything he 
disliked on Thriddar. 

It was not wise to be moved by 
such sympathetic feelings. The 
Grand Panjandrum could not be 
mistaken. It was definitely unwise to 
contradict him. It could even be 
dangerous. Jorgenson was in a nasty 
spot. 

The Witnesses murmured rever- 
ently: 

“We hear the words of the Never- 
Mistaken Glen-U.” 

The high official tucked away 
the scroll and said blandly: 

“I will receive the moneys, goods, 
and benefactions it is the desire of 
the Rim Stars Trading Corporation 
to present to the great and Never- 
Mistaken Glen-U.” 

Jorgenson, boiling inside, never- 
theless knew what he was doing. 
He said succinctly: 

“Like hell you will!” 

There was an idiom in Thrid 
speech that had exactly the mean- 
ing of the human phrase. Jorgenson 
used it. 

The high official looked at him 
in utter stupefaction. Nobody con- 
tradicted the Grand Panjandrum I 
Nobody! The Thrid had noticed 
long ago that they were the most 
intelligent race in the universe. 
Since that was so, obviously they 
must have the most perfect govern- 
ment. But no government could bo 
perfect if its officials made mis- 
takes. So no Thrid official ever 
made a mistake. In particular the 
great and Never-Mistaken Glen-U 
could not conceivably blunder! 
When he said a thing, it was true! 

43 




It had to be! He’d said it! And this 
was the fundamental fact in the 
culture of the Thrid. 

‘‘Like hell you’ll receive moneys 
and goods and such!” snapped Jor- 
genson. “Like hell you will!” 

The high official literally couldn’t 
believe his ears. 

“But — but the great and Never- 
Mistaken Glen-U — ” 

“Is mistaken!” said Jorgenson bit- 
ingly. “He’s wrong! The Rim Stars 
Trading Corporation does not want 
to give him anything! What he has 
said is not true!” This was the equiv- 
alent of treason, blasphemy and the 
ultimate of indecorous behavior to- 
ward a virgin Pelean princess. “I 
won’t give him anything! I’m not 
even vanishing from sight! Glen-U 
is wrong about that, too! Now — 
git!” 

He jerked out his blaster and 
pulled the trigger. 

There was an explosive burst of 
flame from the ground between the 
official and himself. The official fled. 
With him fled all the Witnesses, 
some even losing their headgear in 
their haste to get away. 

Jorgenson stamped into the trad- 
ing-post building. His eyes were 
stormy and his jaw was set. 

He snapped orders. The hired 
Thrid of the trading-post staff had 
not quite grasped the situation. They 
couldn’t believe it. Automatically, 
as he commanded the iron doors 
and shutters of the trading post 
closed, they obeyed. They saw him 
turn on the shocker-field so that 
nobody could cross the compound 
without getting an electric shock 



that would discourage him. They be- 
gan to believe. 

Then he sent for the trading-post 
Thrid consultant. On Earth he’d 
have called for a lawyer. On a 
hostile world there’d have been a 
soldier to advise him. On Thrid the 
specialist to be consulted wasn’t ex- 
actly a theologian, but he was near- 
er that than anything else. 

Jorgenson laid the matter indig- 
nantly before him, repeating the 
exact phrases that said the trading 
company wanted — wanted! — 
practically to give itself to the Nev- 
er-Mistaken Glen-U, who was the 
Grand Panjandrum of Thriddar. He 
waited to be told that it couldn’t 
have happened; that anyhow it 
couldn’t be intended. But the theo- 
logian’s Thriddish ears went limp, 
which amounted to the same thing 
as a man’s face turning pale. He 
stammered agitatedly that if the 
Grand Panjandrum said it, it was 
true. It couldn’t be otherwise! If 
the trading company wanted to give 
itself to him, there was nothing to 
be done. It wanted to! The Grand 
Panjandrum had said so! 

“He also said,” said Jorgenson 
irritably, “that I’m to vanish and 
nevermore be seen face to face by 
any rational being. How does that 
happen? Do I get speared?” 

The trading-post theologian quiv- 
ered. Jorgenson made things much 
worse. 

“This,” he raged, “this is crazy! 
The Grand Panjandrum’s an ordi- 
nary Thrid just like you are! Of 
course he can make a mistake! 
There’s nobody who can’t be 
wrong!” 



IF 




The theologian put up feebly 
protesting, human-like hands. He 
begged hysterically to be allowed 
to go home before Jorgenson van- 
ished, with unknown consequences 
for any Thrid who might be nearby. 

When Jorgenson opened a door 
to kick him out of it, the whole 
staff of the trading-post plunged af- 
ter him. They’d been eavesdropping 
and they fled in pure horror. 

Jorgenson swore impartially at all 
of them and turned the shocker- 
field back on. He plugged in a ca- 
pacity circuit which would turn on 
warning sirens if anything like a 
steam-driven copter passed or hov- 
ered over the trading-post. He put 
blasters in handy positions. The 
Thrid used only spears, knives and 
scimitars. Blasters would defend the 
post against a multitude. 

As a business man, he’d acted 
very foolishly. But he’d acted even 
less sensibly as a human being. He’d 
gotten fed up with a social system 
and a — call it — theology it wasn’t 
his business to change. True, the 
Thrid way of life was appalling, and 
what had happened to Ganti was 
probably typical. But it wasn’t Jor- 
genson’s affair. He’d been unwise 
to let it disturb him. If the Thrid 
wanted things this way, it was their 
privilege. 

In theory, no Thrid should ever 
make a mistake, because he belong- 
ed to the most intelligent race in 
the universe. But a local governor 
was even more intelligent. If an 
ordinary Thrid challenged a local 
governor’s least and lightest remark 
— why — he must be either a 
criminal or insane. The local gover- 

AUNNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE THRID 



nor decided — correctly, of course 
— which he was. If he was a crim- 
inal, he spent the rest of his life in 
a gang of criminals chained together 
and doing the most exhausting labor 
the Thrid could contrive. If he was 
mad, he was confined for life. 

T here’d been Ganti, a Thrid 
of whom Jorgenson had had 
much hope. He believed that Ganti 
could learn to run the trading post 
without human supervision. If he 
could, the trading company could 
simply bring trade goods to Thrid- 
dar and take away other trade goods. 
The cost of doing business would 
be decreased. There could be no 
human-Thrid friction. Jorgenson had 
been training Ganti for this work. 

But the local Thrid governor had 
spoken and said and observed that 
G anti’s wife wanted to enter his 
household. He added that Ganti 
wanted to yield her to him. 

Jorgenson had fumed — but not 
as a business man — when the 
transfer took place. But Ganti had 
been conditioned to believe that 
when a governor said he wanted to 
do something, he did. He couldn’t 
quite grasp the contrary idea. But 
he moped horribly, and Jorgenson 
talked sardonically to him, and he 
almost doubted that an official was 
necessarily right. When his former 
wife died of grief, his disbelief be- 
came positive. And immediately af- 
terward he disappeared. 

Jorgenson couldn’t find out what 
had become of him. Dour reflection 
on the happening had put him in the 
bad mood which had started things, 
this morning. 



(5 




Time passed. He had the trading- 
post in a position of defense. He 
prepared his lunch, and glowered. 
More time passed. He cooked his 
dinner, and ate. Afterward he went 
up on the trading-post roof to 
smoke and to coddle his anger. He 
observed the sunset. There was al- 
ways some haze in the air on Thrid- 
dar, and the colorings were very 
beautiful. He could see the towers 
of the capital city of the Thrid. He 
could see a cumbersome but still 
graceful steam-driven aircraft de- 
scend heavily to the field at the 
city’s edge. Later he saw another 
steam-plane rise slowly but reliably 
and head away somewhere else. He 
saw the steam helicopters go skitter- 
ing above the city’s buildings. 

He fumed because creatures in- 
telligent enough to build steam fliers 
weren’t intelligent enough to see 
what a racket their government was. 
Now that the new Grand Panjan- 
drum had moved against him, Jor- 
genson made an angry, dogged res- 
olution to do something permanent 
to make matters better. For the 
Thrid themselves. Here he thought 
not as a business man only, but as 
a humanitarian. As both. When a 
whim of the Grand Panjandrum 
could ruin a business, something 
should be done. And when Ganti 
and countless others had been vic- 
tims of capricious tyranny. And 
Jorgenson was slated to vanish from 
sight and never again be seen. 
It definitely called for strong meas- 
ures! 

He reflected with grim pleasure 
that the Grand Panjandrum would 
soon be in the position of a Thrid 



whom everybody knew was mis- 
taken. With the trading-post denied 
him and Jorgenson still visible, he’d 
be notoriously wrong. And he 
couldn’t be, and still be Grand Pan- 
jandrum! 

It would be a nice situation for 
Glen-U. He’d have to do something 
about it, and there was nothing he 
could do. He’d blundered, and it 
would soon be public knowledge. 

Jorgenson dozed lightly. Then 
more heavily. Then more heavily 
still. The night was not two hours 
old when the warning sirens made 
a terrific uproar. The Thrid for 
miles around heard the wailing, ul- 
lulating sound of the sirens that 
should have awakened Jorgenson. 

But they didn’t wake him. He 
slept on. 

Ij^T^hen he woke, he knew that he 
^ ^ was cold. His muscles were 
cramped. Half awake, he tried to 
move and could not. 

Then he tried to waken fully, and 
he couldn’t do that either. He 
stayed in a dream-like, frustrated 
state which was partly like a night- 
mare, while very gradually new 
sensations came to him. He felt a 
cushioned throbbing against his 
chest, in the very hard surface on 
which he lay face down. That sur- 
face swayed and rocked slightly. He 
tried again to move, and realized 
that his hands and feet were bound. 
He found that he shivered, and real- 
ized that his clothing had been taken 
from him. 

He was completely helpless and 
lying on his stomach in the cargo- 
space of a steam helicopter: now 

IF 



46 




he could hear the sound of its ma- 
chinery. 

Then he knew what had hap- 
pened. He’d committed fhe un- 
thinkable crime — or lunacy — of 
declaring the Grand Panjandrum 
mistaken. So by the operation of 
truth, which was really an anesthetic 
gas cloud drifted over the trading 
post, he had vanished from sight. 

Now it was evidently to be ar- 
ranged that he would never again 
be seen fdee to face by a rational 
being. The Grand Panjandrum had 
won the argument. Within a few 
months a Rim Stars trading ship 
would land, and Jorgenson would 
be gone and the trading post con- 
fiscated. It would be hopeless to ask 
questions, and worse than hopeless 
to try to trade. So the ship would 
lift off and there’d be no more ships 
for at least a generation. Then 
there might — there might! — be 
another. 

Jorgenson swore fluently and 
with passion. 

‘Tt will not be long,” said a tran- 
quil voice. 

Jorgenson changed from human- 
speech profanity to Thrid. He di- 
rected his words to the unseen crea- 
ture who’d spoken. That Thrid lis- 
tened, apparently without emotion. 
When Jorgenson ran out of breath, 
the voice said severely: 

“You declared the great and 
Never-Mistaken Glen-U mistaken. 
This could not be. It proved you 
either a criminal or insane, because 
no rational creature could believe 
him mistaken. He declared you in- 
sane, and he cannot be wrong. So 
soon you will arrive where you are 



to be confined and no rational be- 
ing will ever see you face to face.” 
Jorgenson switched back to hu- 
man swearing. Then he blended both 
languages, using all the applicable 
words he knew both in human 
speech and Thrid. He knew a great 
many. The soft throbbing of the 
steam-driven rotors went on, and 
Jorgenson swore both as a business 
man and a humanitarian. Both were 
frustrated. 

Presently the motion of the cop- 
ter changed. He knew the ship was 
descending. There were more vio- 
lent swayings, as if from wind gusts 
deflected by something large and 
solid. Jorgenson even heard deep- 
bass rumblings like sea upon a 
rocky coast. Then there were move- 
ments near him, a rope went around 
his waist, a loading-bay opened and 
he found himself lifted and lowered 
through it. 

H e dangled in midair, a couple 
of hundred feet above an ut- 
terly barren island on which huge 
ocean swells beat. The downdraft 
from the copter made him sway 
wildly, and once it had him spin- 
ning dizzily. The horizon was 
empty. He was being lowered swift- 
ly to the island. And his hands and 
feet were still securely tied. 

Then he saw a figure on the 
island. It was a Thrid. stripped of 
all clothing like Jorgenson and 
darkened by the sun. That figure 
came agilely toward where he was 
let down. It caught him. It checked 
his wild swingings, which could have 
broken bones. The rope slackened. 
The Thrid laid Jorgenson down. 



MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE THRID 



47 




He did not cast off the rope. He 
seemed to essay to climb it. 

It was cut at the steam-copter 
and came tumbling down all over 
both of them. The Thrid waved his 
arms wildly and seemed to screech 
gibberish at the sky. There was an 
impact nearby, of something 
dropped. Jorgenson heard the throb- 
bing sound of the copter as it lifted 
and swept away. 

Then he felt the bounds about 
his arms and legs being removed. 
Then a Thrid voice — amaz- 
ingly, a familiar Thrid voice — 
said: 

“This is not good, Jorgenson. 
Who did you contradict?” 

The Thrid was Ganti, of whom 
Jorgenson had once had hopes as a 
business man, and for whose dis- 
aster he had felt indignation as 
something else. He loosened the last 
of Jorgenson’s bonds and helped 
him sit up. 

Jorgenson glared around. The 
island was roughly one hundred feet 
by two. It was twisted, curdled yel- 
low stone from one end to the other. 
There were stone hillocks and a 
miniature stony peak, and a narrow 
valley between two patches of higher 
rock. Huge seas boomed against the 
windward shore, throwing spray 
higher than the island’s topmost 
point. There were some places 
where sand had gathered. There was 
one spot — perhaps a square yard 
of it — where sand had been made 
fertile by the droppings of flying 
things and where two or three 
starveling plants showed foliage of 
sorts. That was all, Jorgenson 
ground his teeth. 



“Go ahead,” said Ganti grimly, 
“but it may be even worse than you 
think.” 

He scrambled over the twisted 
stone of the island. He came back, 
carrying something. 

“It isn’t worse,” he said. “It’s only 
as bad. They did drop food and 
water for both of us. I wasn’t sure 
they would.” 

H is calmness sobered Jorgen- 
son. As a business man, he 
was moved to make his situation 
clear. He told Ganti of the Grand 
Panjandrum’s move to take over 
the Rim Stars trading post, which 
was bad business. He told of his 
own reaction, which was not a bus- 
iness-like one at all. Then he said 
dourly: 

“But he’s still wrong. No rational 
being is supposed ever to see me 
face to face. But you do.” 

“But I’m crazy,” said Ganti calm- 
ly. “I tried to kill the governor who’d 
taken my wife. So he said I was 
crazy and that made it true. So I 
wasn’t put in a chained group of 
laborers. Somebody might have seen 
me and thought about it. But, sent 
here, it’s worse for me and I’m 
probably forgotten by now.” 

He was calm about it. Only a 
Thrid would have been so calm. But 
they’ve had at least hundreds of 
generations in which to get used to 
injustice. He accepted it. But Jor- 
genson frowned. 

“You’ve got brains, Ganti. What’s 
the chance of escape?” 

“None,” said Ganti unemotionally. 
“You’d better get out of the sun. 
It’ll burn you badly. Come along.” 

IF

He led the waj over the bare, 
scorching rocky surface. He turned 
past a small pinnacle. There was 
shadow. Jorgenson crawled into it, 
and found himself in a cave. It was 
not a natural one. It had been hacked 
out, morsel by morsel. It was cool 
inside. It was astonishingly roomy. 

“How’d this happen?” demanded 
Jorgenson the business man. 

“This is a prison,” Ganti ex- 
plained matter-of-factly. “They let 
me down here and dropped food 
and water for a week. They went 
away. I found there’d been another 
prisoner here before me. His skele- 
ton was in this cave. I reasoned it 
out. There must have been others 
before him. When there is a prisoner 
here, every so often a copter drops 
food and water. When the prisoner 
doesn’t pick it up, they stop com- 
ing. When, presently, they have an- 
other prisoner they drop him off, 
like me, and he finds the skeleton 
of the previous prisoner, like me, and 
he dumps it overboard as I did. 
They’ll drop food and water for me 
until I stop picking it up. And pres- 
ently they’ll do the same thing all 
over again.” 

Jorgenson glowered. That was his 
reaction as a person. Then he ges- 
tured to the cave around him. There 
was a pile of dried-out seaweed for 
sleeping purposes. 

“And this?” 

“Somebody dug it out,” said Ganti 
without resentment. “To keep busy. 
Maybe one prisoner only began it, 
A later one saw it started and 
worked on it to keep busy. Then 
others in their turn. It took a good 
many lives to make this cave.” 

MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE THRID 



Jorgenson ground his teeth a seo* 
ond time. 

“And just because they’d contra- 
dicted somebody who couldn’t bo 
wrong! Or because they had a busi- 
ness an official wanted!” 

“Or a wife,” agreed Ganti. “Here! 

He offered food. Jorgenson ate, 
scowling. Afterward, near sundown, 
he went over the island. 

It was rock, nothing else. There 
was a pile of small broken stones 
from the excavation of the cave. 
There were the few starveling plants. 
There was the cordage with which 
Jorgenson had been lowered. There 
was the parcel containing food and 
water. Ganti observed that the plas- 
tic went to pieces in a week or so, 
so it couldn’t be used for anything. 
There was nothing to escape with. 
Nothing to make anything to escape 
with. 

Even the dried seaweed bed was 
not comfortable. Jorgenson slept 
badly and waked with aching mus- 
cles. Ganti assured him unemotion- 
ally that he’d get used to it. 

He did. By the time the copter 
came to drop food and water again, 
Jorgenson was physically adjusted 
to the island. But neither as a busi- 
ness man or as a person could he 
adjust to hopelessness. 

He racked his brains for the most 
preposterous or faintest hope of de- 
liverance. There were times when 
as a business man he reproached 
himself for staying on Thriddar af- 
ter he became indignant with the 
way the planet was governed. It was 
very foolish. But much more often 
he felt such hatred of the manners 
and customs of the Thrid — which 

49 




had put him here — that it seemed 
that something must somehow be 
possible if only so he could take 
revenge. 

Ill 

T he copter came, it dropped 
food and water, and it went 
away. It came, dropped food and 
water, and went away. Once a wa- 
ter-bag burst when dropped. They 
lost nearly half a week’s water 
supply. Before the copter came 
again they’d gone two days without 
drinking. 

There were other incidents, of 
course. The dried seaweed they 
slept on turned to powdery trash. 
They got more seaweed hauling 
long kclp-like strands of it ashore 
from where it clung to the island’s 
submerged rocks. Ganti mentioned 
that they must do it right after the 
copter came, so there would be no 
sign of enterprise to be seen from 
aloft. The seaweed had long, flex- 
ible stems of which no use what- 
ever could be made. When it dried, 
it became stiff and brittle but with- 
out strength. 

Once Ganti abruptly began to 
talk of his youth. As if he were ex- 
amining something he’d never no- 
ticed before, he told of the incred- 
ible conditioning-education of the 
young members of his race. They 
learned that they must never make 
a mistake. Never! Tt did not matter 
if they were unskilled or inefficient. 
It did not matter if they accom- 
plished nothing There was no pen- 
alty for anything but making mis- 



takes or differing from officials who 
could not make mistakes. 

So Thrid younglings were trained 
not to think; not to have any opinion 
about anything; only to repeat what 
nobody questioned; only to do what 
they were told by authority. It oc- 
curred to Jorgenson that on a planet 
with such a population, a skeptic 
could make a great deal of confu- 
sion. 

Then, another time, Jorgenson 
decided to make use of the weather- 
ing cord which had been cut from 
the copter when he was landed. He 
cut off a part of it with a sharp- 
edged fragment of stone from the 
pile some former prisoner on the 
island had made. He unravelled the 
twisted fibers. Then he ground fish- 
hooks from shells attached to the 
island’s rocky walls just below wa- 
ter-line. After that they fished. 
Sometimes they even caught some- 
thing to eat. But they never fished 
when the copter was due. 

Jorgenson found that a fish-fillet, 
strongly squeezed and wrung like a 
wet cloth, would yield a drinkable 
liquid which was not salt and would 
substitute for water. And this was 
a reason to make a string bag in 
which caught fish could be let back 
into the sea so they were there when 
wanted but could not escape. 

They had used it for weeks when 
he saw Ganti, carrying it to place it 
where they left it overboard, swing- 
ing it idly back and forth as he 
walked. 

I f Jorgenson had been only a 
businessman, it would have had 
no particular meaning. But he was 



50 



IF 




also a person, filled with hatred of 
the Thrid who had condemned him 
for life to this small island. He saw 
the swinging of the fish. It gave 
him an idea. 

He did not speak at all during 
all the rest of that day. He was 
thinking. The matter needed much 
thought. Ganti left him alone. 

But by sunset he’d worked it out. 
While they watched Thrid’s red sun 
sink below the horizon, Jorgenson 
said thoughtfully: 

‘‘There is a way to escape, Ganti.” 
“On what? In what?” demanded 
Ganti. 

“In the helicopter that feeds us,” 
said Jorgenson. 

“It never lands,” said Ganti prac- 
tically. 

“We can make it land,” said Jor- 
genson. Thrid weren’t allowed to 
make mistakes; he could make it 
a mistake not to land. 

“The crew is armed,” said Ganti. 
“There are three of them.” 

“They’ve only knives and scimi- 
tars,” said Jorgenson. “They don’t 
count. We can make better weapons 
than they have.” 

Ganti looked skeptical. Jorgenson 
explained. He had to demonstrate 
crudely. The whole idea was novel 
to Ganti, but the Thrid were smart. 
Presently he grasped it. He said: 
“I see the theory. If we can make 
it work, all right. But how do we 
make the copter land?” 

Jorgenson realized that they talk- 
ed oddly. They spoke with leisurely 
lack of haste, with the lack of hope 
normal to prisoners to whom escape 
is impossible, even when they talk 
about escape. They could have been 



discussing a matter that would not 
affect either of them. But Jorgen- 
son quivered inside. He hoped. 

“We’ll try it,” said Ganti detach- 
edly, when he’d explained again. 
“If it fails, they’ll only stop giving 
us food and water.” 

That, of course, did not seem 
either to him or Jorgenson a reason 
to hesitate to try what Jorgenson 
had planned. 

It was not at all a direct and 
forthright scheme. It began with the 
untwisting of more of the rope that 
had lowered Jorgenson. It went on 
with the making of string from that 
fiber. They made a great deal of 
string. Then, very clumsily and awk- 
wardly, they wove strips of cloth, 
a couple of inches wide and five or 
six long. They made light strong 
cords extend from the ends of the 
cloth strips. Then they practiced 
with these bits of cloth and the 
broken stones a former prisoner had 
piled so neatly. 

The copter came and dropped 
food and water. When it left, they 
practiced. When it came again they 
were not practicing, but when it 
went away they practiced. They 
were a naked man and a naked 
Thrid, left upon a morsel of rock 
in a boundless sea, rehearsing them- 
selves in an art so long-forgotten 
that they had to reinvent the finer 
parts of the technique. They experi- 
mented. They tried this. They tried 
that. When the copter appeared, 
they showed themselves. They rush- 
ed upon the dropped bag containing 
food and water as if fiercely trying 
to deny each other a full share. 
Once they seemed to fight over the 



AAANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE THRID 



51 




dropped bag. The copter hovered 
to watch. The fight seemed furious 
and deadly, but inconclusive. 

When the copter went away Jor- 
genson and Ganti went briskly back 
to their practicing. 

T hey were almost satisfied with 
their proficiency, now. They 
had lost some of the small stones, 
but there were many left. They be- 
gan to work with seaweed, the kind 
with long central stems which dried 
to brittle stiffness. They determined 
exactly how long they should be al- 
lowed to dry. They studied the way 
in which the flat seaweed foliage 
must be dried on rounded stone 
spaces to form seemingly solid sur- 
faces of almost any shape. But they 
were utterly brittle when they were 
dry. It was not possible to make 
them hold any form for more than 
a day or so, even if sprinkled with 
cold water to keep them from 
crumbling to dust. 

And they practiced with the strip 
of cloth and the stones. Ganti be- 
came more skilful than Jorgenson, 
but even Jorgenson became an ex- 
pert. 

There came a day when the cop- 
ter dropped the bag of food and 
Ganti danced with seeming rage and 
shook his fist at it. The crew-Thrid 
saw him, but paid no attention. 
They went away. And Ganti and 
Jorgenson went to work. 

They hauled seaweed ashore. It 
had to dry to some degree before 
it could hold a form at all. While 
it dried, they practiced. The leaves 
were ready before the stems. They 
spread them on rounded surfaces, 
52 



many leaves thick. They dried to 
dark-gray-greenish stuff looking like 
the crudest possible cardboard with- 
out a fraction of cardboard’s 
strength or stiffness. Presently the 
stems were dry enough to be stiff 
but not yet entirely brittle. They 
made a framework, uniting its mem- 
bers with string from the dropped 
rope. 

Two days before the copter was 
due again, they used the cardboard- 
like but fragile curved sheet of sea- 
weed-leaves to cover the frame. 
Finished, they had what looked like 
the fuselage of a landed copter. 

Thicker but brittle sections of the 
stems seemed rotor-blades when 
more seaweed-cardboard was at- 
tached. From two hundred feet, the 
crudities of the object would not 
show. It would look like a helicopter 
landed on the island where Jorgen- 
son and Ganti were confined. 

It would look like a rescue. 

When the copter arrived, it 
checked in midair as if it braked. 
It hung in the air. Its crew stared 
down. They saw a strange aircraft 
there. The helicopter whirled and 
went streaking away toward the 
horizon. 

Jorgenson and Ganti immediately 
attacked their own creation. The 
framework was brittle; barely able 
to sustain its own weight. They furi- 
ously demolished the whole thing. 
They hauled its fragments into the 
cave. They worked furiously to re- 
move every trace of its former 
presence. 

Within two hours a fleet of six 
steam-copters came driving across 
the sea. They swept over the island. 

IF 




They looked. They saw Jorgenson 
and Ganti — naked man and naked 
Thrid — glaring up at them. They 
saw nothing else. There was nothing 
else to see. 

There was a Thrid official on one 
of the copters. The matter had been 
reported to him. A helicopter could 
only have landed on this island to 
rescue the prisoners. They were not 
rescued. There had been no heli- 
copter. The crew of the craft which 
made the report had made a mistake! 

Jorgenson arid Ganti gloated to- 
gether when darkness had fallen. 
The copter-crew had made a false 
report. They would face an angry 
official. Either they’d take back 
their original report, or stick to it. 
If they took it back, they’d tried to 
deceive an official, who could not 
be wrong. Jorgenson and Ganti 
gloated over what they’d done to 
their jailers. 

IV 

V^hen a copter came again 
^ ~ a week later, it was not the 
same flier or the same crew. The 
bag of food and water was dropped 
from a different height. The copter 
hovered until it saw both Jorgenson 
and Ganti. Then it went away. 

They set to work again on sea- 
weed hauled from the sea, and 
leaves smoothed over each other on 
suitable surfaces of rock. Stems up 
to four and five inches in diameter 
to be straightened out and almost 
dried to seem rotor-shafts, and less- 
er stems to make a framework. The 
mockup was tied together with 
string. They finished it the night be- 

MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE THRID 



fore the copter was due again, and 
they practiced with their bits ot 
cloth and the stones until the light 
ended. They practiced again at day- 
break, but when the helicopter came 
across the sea they were nowhere 
visible. 

But there was an aircraft aground 
upon the island. From the air it 
looked remarkably convincing. 

The prisoners listened eagerly 
from the hollowed-out cave. The 
mockup on the ground was in a 
miniature valley between sections 
of taller stone. It could be seen 
from above, but not well from the 
side. From one end it could not be 
seen at all, but from the other it 
was a remarkable job. It would de- 
ceive any eyes not very close indeed. 

The flying helicopter hovered 
and hovered, sweeping back and 
forth. Its crew-members saw no 
movement anywhere, which was not 
possible. If there was an aircraft 
aground, there must be Thrid who 
had flown it here. They were not 
to be seen. The prisoners were not 
to be seen. The situation was im- 
possible. 

Jorgenson and Ganti waited. 

The flying jailers could not report 
what they saw. A previous crew 
had done that, and when they were 
proved mistaken or worse, they 
donned chains to do hard labor so 
long as they lived. But the Thrid in 
the copter over the island dared not 
not-report. Somebody else might 
sight it, and they’d be condemned 
for not reporting. They couldn’t re- 
port it and they couldn’t not-report 
it! 

Jorgenson grinned when the 

53 




throbbing of the rotors became 
louder and louder as the steam- 
helicopter descended. He and Ganti 
made ready. 

The flying vehicle landed. They 
heard it. Its crew got out, fearful 
but alert and with weapons handy. 
One stayed close by the ship, his 
ears shriveled with terror. The other 
two, weapons very much to the fore, 
moved cautiously to examine the 
aircraft which could not possibly be 
here. 

Jorgenson and Ganti, together, 
scrambled from the hollowed-out 
cave. 

Ganti swung his strip of cloth. 
It had a strong cord attached to 
each end, and he held the cords so 
the cloth formed a pocket in which 
a stone lay. The whole whirled furi- 
ously. Ganti released one cord. The 
stone flew. It struck the Thrid on 
guard by the machine squarely in 
the middle of his forehead. Jorgen- 
son’s stone arrived the fraction of 
a second later, before the Thrid 
started to fall. They moved out, 
Jorgenson grinning in a most un- 
businessman-like manner. They 
heard the startled exclamation of 
the other two newcomers as they 
realized that they saw only a mock- 
up of a landed flier, a thing which 
crumbled as they touched it. 

Jorgenson and Ganti swung their 
sIin<TS together. The jailer-Thrid 
turned just in time to see what was 
happening to them. It was final. 

And the copter took off again 
with Ganti and Jorgenson clothed 
and with an adequate supply of 
stones in improvised pockets in their 
garments. 



I t was perfectly simple from 
that time on. They walked in- 
to a village of the Thrid, on the 
mainland. It was the village where 
Ganti had lived; whose governor 
had spoken and said and observed 
that Ganti’s wife wished to enter 
his household and that Ganti wished 
her to. Ganti marched truculently 
down its wider street. Astonished 
eyes turned upon him. Ganti said 
arrogantly: 

*T am the new governor. Call 
others to see.” 

The villagers could mot question 
the statement of an official. Not 
even the statement that he was an 
official. So Ganti — with Jorgenson 
close behind — swaggered into the 
local governor’s palace. It wasn’t 
impressive, but merely a leafy, 
thatched, sprawling complex of 
small buildings. Ganti led the way 
into the inmost portion of the palace 
and found a fat, sleeping Thrid with 
four villager-Thrid fanning him 
with huge fans. Ganti shouted, and 
the fat Thrid sat up, starkly be- 
wildered. 

“I speak and say and observe,” 
said Ganti coldly, “that I am the 
new governor and that you are 
about to die, with no one touching 
you.” 

The fat Thrid gaped at him. It 
was incredible. In fact, to a Thrid 
who had never heard of a missile 
weapon — it was impossible. Ganti 
swung his strip of cloth by the two 
cords attached to it. It whirled too 
swiftly to be seen clearly. A stone 
flew terribly straight. There was an 
impact. 

The local governor who had 

IF 



54 




spoken and said and observed that 
Ganti’s wife wanted to enter his 
household was quite dead. 

said Ganti to his former fel- 
low-villagers, “I am the governor. 
If any deny it, they will die with no 
one touching them.” 

And that was that. 

Ganti grimaced at Jorgenson: 

“I’ll speak and say and observe 
something useful for you presently, 
Jorgenson. Right now I’m going to 
march on foot and talk to the pro- 
vincial governor. I’ll take a train 
of attendants, so he’ll receive me. 
Then I’ll tell him that he’s about 
to die with nobody touching him. 
He’s earned it!” 

Unquestionably, Ganti was right. 

j\ ny Thrid official, to whom 
it was impossible to be mis- 
taken, would develop eccentric no- 
tions. 

Most humans couldn’t stand by 
and watch. They got off Thriddar 
as soon as possible. At the moment, 
Jorgenson couldn’t leave the planet, 
but he didn’t want to see what Ganti 
could and would and by human 
standards probably ought to do. He 
camped in the steam-copter, in hid- 
ing, until Ganti sent him a message. 

Then he started up the copter and 
flew back to the trading post. It 
was empty. Gutted. Looted. But 
there was a high official waiting 
for him in the courtyard. He held 
a scroll in his hand. It gHnted golden. 
When Jorgenson regarded him 
grimly, the high official made a 
sound equivalent to clearing his 
throat, and the Witness-hatted Thrid 
around him became silent. 



“On this day,” intoned the high 
official, “on this day did Ganti, the 
Never-Mistaken, as have been his 
predecessors through the ages; — 
on this day did the Never-Mistaken 
Ganti speak and say and observe a 
truth in the presence of the gover- 
nors and the rulers of the universe.” 

Jorgenson listened grimly. The 
new Grand Panjandrum had made 
him — Jorgenson — a provincial 
governor. 

Ganti was grateful. The contents 
of the trading post would be re- 
turned. From this time on the Rim 
Stars Trading Corporation would 
prosper as never before. 

But Jorgenson wasn’t a Thrid. He 
saw things as a businessman does, 
but also and contradictorily bie saw 
them as right and just or wrong and 
intolerable. As a businessman, he 
saw that everything had worked out 
admirably. As a believer in right and 
wrong, it seemed to him that noth- 
ing in particular had happened. 

He’d have done better, he con- 
sidered, to do what most humans 
did after understanding what went 
on on Thriddar, and what seeming- 
ly always must go on on Thriddar. 
Because the Thrid had noticed that 
they were the most intelligent race 
in the universe, and therefore must 
have the most perfect possible gov- 
ernment whose officials must in- 
evitably be incapable of making a 
mistake. 

When the Rim Stars trading ship 
came to ground, a month later, Jor- 
genson went on board and stayed 
there. He remained on board when 
the ship left. Thriddar was no place 
for him. END

SHOESTRING 
— or LESS 



BY THEODORE STURGEON 



S hyly and silently, there has 
sidled into our cosmos one of 
the most extraordinary and poten- 
tially influential volumes ever put 
between covers. 

It’s a heady experience to hold this 
book in your hands and reflect what 
the world would be if Newton, Da 
Vinci or Eratosthenes had had the 
same privilege. You might say that 
this is only marvelling, and what’s 



so heady? and you’re right. It be- 
comes heady when you realize that 
in this season of the proliferation of 
laws, no one has yet passed one 
proclaiming that there shall be no 
more Da Vincis — though most 
people seem to feel that somehow 
or other there can be no more giants. 
They’re wrong. 

And just as this book could have 
moved the earth ’way back yonder, 

IF 



56 



so it can today — and it is very 
likely that it will; because it is being 
distributed all over the world. 

It’s a paperback, and about the 
only way it could have been pro- 
moted less would be if it had never 
existed. 1 ran across it last Christ- 
mas in a toy catalog. Then when 
the local elementary school over- 
crowded itself into split sessions, the 
PTA started a sort of al fresco 
school to add a little something to 
a four-hour school day, and included 
a science demonstrations course. I 
bethought me of this book and had 
the Library order it. 

As soon as it came in it went 
straight to my desk for this treat- 
ment, so you may pride yourself 
(if such be your pride) that on your 
account there is a long and angry 
waiting list at the Library for it. 
Some of ’em got angry enough to 
buy it for themselves, which is a 
pretty beneficial side effect, at that. 

Some time ago I wrote for in- 
formation as to price, ordering ad- 
dress, and permission to reproduce 
some of the illustrations; but as I 
said, promotion they ain’t got. My 
letter remains, at this writing, unan- 
swered. Therefore I made the draw- 
ings on these pages myself; they are 
not, then, reproductions, but illus- 
trations of matter in the book. 

S OURCE BOOK FOR SCIENCE 
TEACHING is published by 
UNESCO, printed in France. A 
footnote in the bibliography re- 
ferring to UNESCO publications 
says they may be obtained from 
“Place de Fontenoy, Paris 7®, 
France. Copies may also be obtain- 

SCIENCE ON A SHOE STRING - OR LESS 



ed in most countries from 
UNESCO’s national distributors.” 

The catalog describes it; “Over 
700 science demonstrations and ex- 
periments, using everyday materials. 
Prepared by the UNESCO office, 
with the help of world science edu- 
cation leaders.” 

Now, this is more than just an 
elementary science handbook. All 
over the world, in the Far East, in 
Africa, in Latin America, literacy 
is rising. With it rises the number 
of communities with shacks or tents 
or just the shade of a tree for 
schools, and somewhat less than 
nothing at all for materials. Science 
teaching therefore becomes a mat- 
ter of real basics, right down to the 
level of the wedge and the lever, 
because you can always lay hands on 
a rock and a stick to demonstrate 
with. But this has its virtue. Simple 
materials call for more honest-to- 
God science (along with h-t-G 
teaching) than any amount of 
crackle-finished black boxes full of 
technology. In addition, the jungle 
(or desert, or Outback) youngster 
who learns his science this way is 
far more likely to relate science to 
his everyday life than our kids, who 
can coexist with years of film-strips 
and closed-circuit TV teaching aids, 
and remain untouched. 

Compactly described, this big 
(6x9%”) paperback has 252 closely 
printed pages with hundreds of ex- 
cellent illustrations. It has no index, 
but the contents page is quite com- 
prehensive. The appendices include 
a booklist, periodicals from all over 
the world, and a chart of rocks and 
minerals. Then there are 15 pages 

57 





ol iclcrcnce tables, conversions and 
the like, and even a rule, a pro- 
tractor. and a 30 degree and a 60 
degree triangle. 

Ihe tone and purpose of the 
book are best demonstrated by 
drawings. The scale in Fig. 1 is 
amazingly sensitive, and can be 
made as accurate as an expensive 
instrument if you are willing to take 
care in calibrating it. The small bolt 
(it happens that one from an Erec- 
tor set is just right) gives you the 
finest of fine adjustments. The bear- 
ing, a fine needle resting on the 
edges of two razor blades, is about 
as frictionless as a bearing can be 
(but see Fig. 21) and the long lever 
arm makes small movements easy 
to see. You calibrate it by setting 
it to the zero point and then hang- 
ing weights made of aluminium 
(sic) from the pointer. “A common 
gauge of foil,” says the book, 
“weighs 5 mg. for 2 sq, cm. of area.” 
Having gotten your gross divisions 
with these, you proceed to subdivide 
as much as your patience and your 
steady hand permit. This scale will 
readily weigh a single human hair, 
or. with a tiny foil bucket (you’ll 
58 



have to reset it to zero) almost 
microscopic beads of liquid. 

Z ehnder balance (and I wish 
I knew who and where Mr. Z 
is so I could shake his hand) will 
do more than a boy scout knife 
plus Mr. Clean. If you look care- 
fully at the drawing you will see 
that the large cork rests only on 
the points of the two pins. No mat- 
ter how carefully you look you 
won’t see that they rest on two 
slips of glass placed on top of the 
wooden base, because I couldn’t 
figure out how to draw them. The 
balance beam is a knitting needle. 
The sensitivity adjustment lies in 
the amount the pins are pushed 
through the cork. 

Now listen to this: 2 mg. (the 
weight of a short piece of fine cot- 
ton thread) on one arm of the beam 
will rotate it about 2 cm. (about 
3/4” — enough to see easily.) If 
an experiment yields an almost im- 
measurably small jet of gas, this 
balance will detect it. A lighted 
match below the beam will demon- 
strate air convection. The beam is 
an insulated conductor, and there- 
fore can be electrified, showing the 
slightest trace of static electricity. 




IF 






Magnetized, it becomes a dip needle. 
It is also a galvanometer: a coil 
of 22 turns of copper wire, con- 
nected to a thermocouple, and held 
near the beam, will cause the beam 
to rotate appreciably when the 
thermocouple is heated with a 
candle, delivering about .01 volt. 
Attach a tiny mirror to one end of 
the beam, and project a beam of 
light off it to a distant wall, and 
the balance will detect the current 
generated when you grasp the 
thermocouple with your fingers! 

Fig. 3 is drawn from various 
parts of the book. The upright is 
half of one of those flat brass tele- 
scopic curtain rods, screwed to the 
wooden base. The ring is made of 
coat-hanger wire with the ends 
folded back on themselves to make 
a close sliding fit inside the upright. 
(This is my own design; the book 
uses one of those snivvics which 
clamps on to the light-bulb to hold 
a lampshade. I was unable to find 
one locally without the whole lamp- 
shade attached.) Note the three seg- 
ments of asbestos tape on the ring; 
these keep the dish from cracking 
along the line of the ring. The 
alcohol lamp is made of an ink 
bottle. The tube is half a brass rifle 
cartridge soldered to a hole in the 
bottle cap. The inset shows how the 
other half of the cartridge can make 
a stopper for the lamp. If no cart- 
ridge is available, an adequate tube 
can be made with tin from a can 
formed around a dowel and solder- 
ed. 

The dish is the top of an old elec- 
tric-light bulb, and the book gives 
most explicit instructions for sal- 




vaging great wealth from these 
little-regarded treasures. A light 
bulb, variously cut and serviced, will 
give you a funnel, a flask, a set of 
ready-made electrodes, and a good 
many other things. You can cut one 
by scoring it with a three-cornered 
file, tieing a string along the score, 
soaking it with kerosene and setting 
it afire. When the fire goes out, 
plunge it into ice water. You may 
also use a soldering iron, run along 
the scratch. The sharp edge can be 
treated by playing a fine gas flame 
along it. 

I wish I had space to describe 
the demonstration gears made of 
pop-bottle caps, or the optical il- 
lusions, or the plant bio experi- 
ments, or the astronomy demonstra- 
tions, or — oh, hell, go buy the 
booki END

THE CHARACTERS 



STEVE RYELAND knew that he was a cnminol, who hod foiled the 
Plan of Man . but he could not remember his crime. Around 
his neck he wore the iron collar that contained an explosive 
charge that would destroy him if he tried escape; but what the 
deed v/as that had put it there he could only remember in tanta- 
lizing fragments. With his fellow convicted Risk, 

ODDS OPORTO, Ryeland was ordered to take up a new job in the 
service of the Plan. Still a prisoner, he traveled aboard the 
luxurious private subtrain car of 

THE PLANNER, the greet, powerful men who was the voice of The 
Machine, unquestioned ruler of the world's thirteen billion people. 
The Planner told him that his job was to develop a "jetiess drive'^ — 
a new space propulsion system that would permit the forces of the 
Plan to expand into the Reefs of Space, the half-mythical bodies 
that circled the solar system far beyond the orbit of Pluto. 

DONNA CREERY, the daughter of the Planner, also told Ryeland 
of the spaceling, the strange creature from the distant Reefs that 
lived on energy and itself seemed to have a "jetless drive". Arriv- 
ing at his destination, Ryeland was astonished to find that he 
himself was in charge of a whole project under the Plan of Man — 
although a convicted Risk, wearing the iron collar, he had authority 
over high-ranking officers and important research workers. Yet 
there was something strange about his authority, almost as though 
he were not so much the conductor of an experimental project 
as its subject. And there was the chronic, nagging worry of his 
past always in his mind! For he could not remember the parts of 
his life that should have been crystal-clear . •

PART II 
Vil 

R yeland’s new authority as leader 
of the Attack Team did noth- 
ing to endear him to his colleagues. 

He didn’t care. He had work 
enough to keep him busy. Oddball 
Oporto made himself useful. The 
little man’s talent for lightning com- 
puting saved Ryeland a good deal 
of time. Not that Oporto was faster 
than a computer. He wasn’t; but 
Oporto had a distinct advantage 
over the binary digital types in that 
problems didn’t have to be encoded 
and taped, then decoded. 

Still, in the final analysis there 
were not too many problems to com- 
pute. In fact, that was the big prob- 
lem: Ryeland could find no handle 
by which to grasp the question of 
the jetless drive. 

But Oporto made himself useful 
in other ways as well. He had a 
prying nose for news, for example, 
which kept Ryeland informed of 
what was going on in the Team 
Project. *‘Fleemer’s got the sulks,” 
he reported one day. “Holed up in 
his room, doesn’t come out.” 

“AH right,” said Ryeland ab- 
sently. “Say, where’s my Physical 
Constants of Steady -State Equa- 
tions?” 

“It’s indexed under 603.811,” 
Oporto said patiently. “The word is 
that Fleemer is having an argument 
with the Machine. Messages are go- 
ing back and forth, back and forth, 
all the time.” 

“What?” Ryeland looked up, mo- 
mentarily diverted from the task of 



scribbling out a library requisitioa 
for the book he needed. “Nobody 
can argue with the Machine!” 

Oporto shrugged. “I don’t know 
what you’d call it, then.” 

“General Fleemer is filing re- 
ports,” Ryeland said firmly. He beck- 
oned to Faith, brooding in a corner. 
The Togetherness girl came eagerly 
forward, saw the slip, looked glum, 
shrugged and went off to get the 
book. 

“Sure,” said Oporto. “Say, have 
you heard anything from Donna 
Creery?” 

Ryeland shook his head. 

“I hear she’s in Port Canaveral.” 

Ryeland snapped: “That’s her 

problem. No doubt the Planner’s 
daughter has plenty of occasions for 
off-Earth trips.” 

“No doubt,” agreed Oporto, 
“but — ” 

“But you could mind your busi- 
ness,” said Ryeland, closing the dis- 
cussion. 

Faith came back with the book. 
Ryeland verified a couple of figures 
and turned a sheet of calculations 
over to Oporto. “Here, solve these 
for me. It’ll give you something to 
do,” he said. He stood up, looking 
absently around the room. This was 
his A Section, devoted to the Hoyle 
Effect. He had a whole sub-Team 
of workers going here. Still, he 
thought, it was a waste of time. 

“No sweat,” said Oporto cheer- 
fully, handing back to the completed 
equations. 

“Thanks.” Ryeland glanced at 
them, then dumped them on the 
desk of one of the other workers. 
There wasn’t much to be done but 



THE REEFS OF SPACE

routine; he could leave it to the 
others now. That was why it was a 
waste of time. All the prior art was 
in hand and digested; it was only 
a matter of checking out the math 
now. Then he could answer the Ma- 
chine’s questions — but in fact, he 
knew, he could pretty well answer 
them now. Under what conditions 
could hydrogen growth occur? That 
was easy. Basic theory gave most 
of the answer; an analysis of the 
data from Lescure’s expedition in 
the Cristobal Colon gave a clue to 
the rest. And what was the possi- 
bility of halting or reversing the 
formation? That was easy too. Hu- 
mans could have little control over 
the processes that could build stars. 
With finite equipment, in finite 
time, the probability was zero. 

But it was a measure of the Ma- 
chine’s — desperation? Was that a 
word you could apply to the Ma- 
chine — a measure of the Ma- 
chine’s, well, urgency that it could 
even ask such questions as these. 

Ryeland said uncomfortably: 
**Come on, Oporto. Let’s go take a 
look at the spaceling.” 

A nd that was B Section, and 
it was going badly indeed. 
Jetless drive! It was impossible, 
that was all. If Ryeland hadn’t had 
the maddening spectacle of the 
spaceling right there before him, he 
would have sworn that the laws were 
right. 

For every action, Newton had 
stated centuries before, there is an 
equal and opposite reaction. That 
law of motion accounted for every 
movement of every creature on 



Earth. The cilia of the first swim- 
ming paramecium propelled the 
creature forward by propelling an 
equal mass of water backward. It 
was the same with the thrust of a 
propeller, in water or in air. Rockets 
thrust forward by reaction, as the 
mass of the ejected jet’s hot mole- 
cules went one way, the vessel the 
rockets drove went another. Action 
and reaction! 

It was an equation that was easy 
to write — Mass times Acceleration 
equals Mass-prime times Accelera- 
tion-prime — and it was an equa- 
tion that was hard to doubt. 

But it did not happen to be true. 
The evidence of the dazed little 
creature from space made a liar 
out of Newton. The spaceling’s trick 
of floating without visible reaction 
confounded the greatest genius the 
world has ever known. 

The spaceling showed no reac- 
tion mass at all. 

Whatever it was that permitted 
the spaceling to hover, it (call it 
‘^X”) did not: 

Disturb the currents of the air; 
affect plumb-bobs hung all about; 
register on photographic film; dis- 
charge a gold-leaf electroscope; dis- 
turb a compass; produce a meas- 
urable electric, magnetic or elec- 
tronic field; add to the weight of 
the cage when the entire structure 
was supported on a scale; make any 
audible sound; affect the basal me- 
tabolism of the spaceling itself; or 
produce a discoverable track in a 
cloud chamber. 

“X” did, on the other hand, do a 
few things. 

It affected the “brain waves” of 

IP 



64 




the spaceling; there was a distinc- 
tive trace on the EEG. 

It seemed to have a worrisome 
effect on certain other mammals. 
This was noticed by chance when a 
cat happened to wander into the 
rocket pit; when the spaceling lifted 
itself the cat was “spooked”, leaping 
about stiff-legged, fur bristling, eyes 
aglare. 

And finally, it worked. Whatever 
“X” was, it lifted the spaceling with 
great ease. 

They even wrapped the spaceling 
in chains once, more than six hun- 
dred pounds of them. And as if 
amused the spaceling floated with 
all six hundred pounds for an hour, 
purring to itself. 

It was maddening. 

Still, thought Ryeland, though the 
comfort was small — at least the 
thing seemed healthier. The wounds 
were healing. The small symbiotic 
animals that were left seemed to 
survive. The spaceling showed life 
and energy. 

Donna Creery would be pleased. 

N obody else seemed very pleased 
with Ryeland, though. Gen- 
eral Fleemer stayed in his room, 
venturing forth only occasionally to 
make sardonic comments and get 
in the way. The other high brass of 
the Team didn’t have Fleemer’s 
ready escape, since they had specific 
tasks; but they made sure to be as 
unpleasant to Ryeland as they could 
manage. 

Only Major Chatterji was affable 
at all, and that was second nature 
to him. He came by every hour on 
the hour for a report. He was very

little trouble. If Ryeland was busy, 
the major waited inconspicuously m 
the background. If Ryeland was 
free, the major asked a minimum of 
questions and then departed. Rye- 
land was pretty sure that all the in- 
formation went, first, to the Ma- 
chine and, second, almost as prompt- 
ly to General Fleemer; but he could 
see no reason why he should at- 
tempt to interfere with the process. 
And he could also see no reason to 
believe he would be successful if ho 
tried. 

He kept busy. 

Oporto said one afternoon: “Say, 
it’s definite about your girl friend.** 

Ryeland blinked up from his 
papers. “Who?” He was genuinely 
confused for a moment; then ho 
remembered Oporto’s previous re- 
marks. “You mean Miss Creery?’* 

“Miss Creery, yeah.” The littlo 
man grinned. “She’s off to the Moon. 
Her daddy, too.” 

“That’s nice,” said Ryeland. Care- 
fully he kept his voice noncommit- 
tal, though he wondered who ho 
was fooling. No matter how well ho 
diguised his interest from Oporto, 
he couldn’t disguise it from himself: 
Something inside him reacted to the 
thought of Donna Creery. 

Oporto sprawled lazily over Rye- 
land’s desk. “Well, I don’t know if 
it is so nice, Steve,” he said seriously. 
“Maybe they ought to stay home and 
attend to business. Did you hear 
about the Paris tube collapse?” 

“What?” Ryeland wearily put 
down the sheaf of reports and 
blinked at his friend. His eyes 
smarted. He rubbed them, wonder- 
ing if he needed sleep. But that 

«9 




didn't seem reasonable, he figured; 
he’d had at least eight hours sleep 
in the previous forty-eight. In any 
case, he didn’t have the time; so he 
put the thought out of his mind and 
said: “What the devil are you talk- 
ing about, Oporto?” 

The little man said: “Just what I 
said. The Paris subtrain to Finland. 
The tube collapse. More than a hun- 
dred people missing — and that 
means dead, of course. When a 
tube gives out a hundred miles down 
you aren’t ‘missing.’ ” 

Rycland said, starrted: “But that 
isn’t possible! I mean, T know the 
math for those tubes. They can col- 
lapse. all right, but not v/ithout 
plenty of warning. They can’t break 
down without three hours of field 
degeneration — plenty of time to 
halt transits.” 

Oporto shrugged. “A hundred 
dead people would be glad to know 
that. Steve.” he said. 

Ryeland thought for a second 
“Well,” he said wearily, “maybe 
you’re right, maybe the Planner 
ought to be around to keep an eye 
on things like that. Oh, hello, 
Major.” 

Chatterji came smiling in, peer- 
ing amiably through his gold glasses. 
“I wondered if there was anything 
to report, Mr. Ryeland.” 

While Ryeland searched through 
the papers on his desk, Oporto said: 
“We were just talking about the 
Paris trouble. Major.” 

Chatterji’s brown eyes went 
op' que. There was a marked silence. 

Ryeland took it in, and realized 
that Machine Major Chatterji was 
concerned about the tube failure 
66 



between Paris and the Finland cen- 
ter. Odd, he thought, why should 
Chatterji care? But he was too 
weary to pursue the subject fur- 
ther. He found the requisition he 
was looking for and silently passed 
it across the Chatterji. 

Tb.e major glanced at it casually, 
then intently. His crcw-cut black 
hair seemed to stand on end. “But, 
dear Rycland!” he protested, blink- 
ing throng: I In’s gold-rimrned glasses. 
“This equipment — ” 

“I’ve ch-ecked it with the Ma- 
chine,” Rycland said obstin.ately. 
“Here,” He showed the tcletane to 
Major Chatterji. 

Acth;P PequeFt approved. Ac- 
tion. Concert with Major Chat-

“But, my d-.^ar PyelandT* The ma- 
jor’s expression was tortured. “B 
isn’t only a niattcr of power sources. 
Think of the r-'er cons’ricrabons!” 
“What the Plan requires, the 
Plan shall have,” Ryeland quoted, 
beginning to enjoy himself. 

“Of course, of course. But — ” The 
major studied the list. “You have 
enough rdrctronic equipment here 
to run a u’dversity lab,” he wailed 
“And some of it is dangerous. After 
the, uh, accident Mr. Oporto was 
talkine about, surely you under 
stand that we can’t take chances.” 
Ry eland stared. “What does that 
have to do with the Team project?” 
The major said angrily, “The 
Plan can’t stand accidents, Mr. Rye- 
land! This equipment creates radia- 
tion hazards, if nothing else, and

Points Circle Black, Triangle Gray, 
Crescent Green and Square silver 
alone. They can’t be exposed to this 
sort of thing!” 

Ryeland tapped the teletape 
meaningfully. 

“Oh,” sighed the major, “if the 
Machine approves. .” He thought 
for a moment, then brightened. “I 
have it! An orbiting rocket!” 

Ryeland was taken aback. 
“What?” 

“An orbiting rocket filled with all 
the equipment you want,” Chatter- 
ji said eagerly. “Why not? Every- 
thing run by remote control. I can 
requisition one for you at once, Mr. 
Ryeland! And you can fill it with all 
the dangerous equipment you like 
— what do we care what happens 
to any wandering spacelings, eh?” 
He winked and giggled. 

“Well,” said Ryeland doubtfully, 
“we could do it that way.” 

“Of course we could! We’ll ar- 
range a TV repeater circuit with 
remote-controlled apparatus. You 
work in your lab, the equipment is 
out in space. Perform any experi- 
ments you like. And that way,” he 
beamed, “if you blow the lab up 
you destroy only one ship, not all 
of MJ.” He bustled off. 

I t was astonishing what the Plan 
of Man could accomplish. The 
rocket was loaded, launched and or- 
bited in forty-eight hours. 

Ryeland never saw it. He monitor- 
ed the installation of the equipment 
he wanted via TV circuits, tested 
the instruments, gave the okay — 
and watched the fire-tailed bird leap 

THE REEFS OF SPACE 



off its launching pad through a cath- 
ode screen. At once he put it to 
work. The only thing they had 
learned about the force the space- 
ling generated, what the Planner 
had called the “jetless drive”, waa 
that it was indetectable. But that 
in itself was a great piece of knowl- 
edge. Ryeland’s researchers had 
turned up another fact — a high- 
energy nuclear reaction which turn- 
ed out less energy than went into 
it — and it was just possible, it was 
more than possible, it was perhaps 
a fact, that that missing energy was 
not missing at all, but merely not 
detectable. 

Like the energy of the space- 
ling. Ryeland determined to re- 
create the nuclear reactions which 
were involved. 

Until the morning that the To- 
getherness girl woke him with news: 
“Rise and shine, Steve,” she sang, 
bringing him his breakfast. “Guess 
what! General Fleemer’s going to 
be at the Teamwork conference to- 
day.” 

Steve got groggily to his feet. 
“That’s his privilege,” he said thickly, 
and looked at her, young, pretty, 
fresh — though she had been with 
him, tirelessly running errands, 
through half the night, “Don’t you 
ever get tired?” he asked sourly. 

“Oh, no, Steve! Eat your break- 
fast.” She perched on his chair, 
watching him, and said earnestly: 
“We’re not here to get tired, Steve. 
We have our job! We Togethernesa 
girls are the connecting wires that 
hold the Plan of Man’s circuit to- 
gether.” 

He gaped at her, but she was 



67 




serious. “That’s right/' she nodded. 
“The Plan of Man depends as much 
on us as on the transistors and con- 
densers and capacitors — that’s you 
and the other brass. Everyone, is 
important! Don’t forget, Steve: ‘To 
each his own job — and his own 
job only.* ” 

“I won’t forget,” he said, and 
wearily drank his citrus juice. But 
the girl had something on her mind, 
he saw. She was waiting for an op- 
portunity to speak to him. “Well? 
What is it?” 

She seemed embarrassed. “Oh, 
“Uh — it’s just that — well, there’s 
talk, Steve. The girls were wonder- 
ing about something.” 

“For heaven’s sake, say it!” 

“We wondered,” she said primly, 
“if our Team really had anything 
to do with these accidents.” 

Ryeland blinked and rubbed his 
eyes. But rubbing his eyes didn’t 
change anything; the girl still sat 
there with the mildly embarrassed, 
mildly apologetic expression. “Acci- 
dents? Faith, what are you talking 
about?” 

“The Paris-Finland tube,” she re- 
cited. “The Bombay power plant ex- 
plosion. The cargo-jet crash in Ne- 
vada. You know.” 

“No, I didn’t know. Half those 
things I never heard of. Oporto’s 
been falling down on the job.” 
“There are others, Steve. And 
what the girls are saying — ” She 
paused. “I only wondered if it was 
true. They say our Team project has 
caused them. They even say that 
you, Steve — ” 

“That I what?” 

“Oh, I suppose it’s ridiculous. 



General Fleemer said it wasn’t real- 
ly true, anyway, that you had some- 
thing to do with it. But they say you 
were involved in planning the sub- 
trains. .” 

He grumbled, “They say some 
weird things. Excuse me while I 
dress, will you?” 

He couldn’t put it out of his 
mind. It was foolish, he mought 
testily. How did rumors like that 
start? 

At the day’s Teamwork confer- 
ence, sure enough. General Fleemer 
had done them the unusual honor 
of attending. Ryeland scowled at 
him thoughtfully, then remembered 
the silly rumor. “Before we get 
started,” he demanded, “has any- 
body heard anything about our work 
causing accidents?” 

A dozen blank expressions met his 
stare. Then the head of the com- 
puter section coughed and said hesi- 
tantly, “Well, there was some talk, 
Mr. Ryeland.” 

“What kind of talk?” 

The computerman shrugged. “Just 
talk. One of the data-encoders had 
heard from a cousin who heard from 
somebody else. You know how it 
goes. The story is that our work 
here has upset the radio-control 
circuits, heaven knows how.” 

“That’s preposterous!” Steve ex- 
ploded. “What the devil do they 
mean by that?” He stopped himself. 
It wasn’t the computerman’s fault, 
after all. “Well,” he said grimly, “if 
anybody hears anything else like 
that, I want it reported to me!” 
Heads nodded; every head but 
General Fleemer’s. He barked test- 
ily: “Ryeland! Are we going to gossip 




about accidents, or is the Team go- 
ing to chart its course for the day?’' 

Ryeland swallowed his temper. 
In spite of the fact that Donna Creer 
had put him in charge of the Team, 
General Flecmer’s seniority made 
him a bad man to tangle with. 

‘‘All right,” said Ryeland, “let’s get 
on with it.” Then he brightened. “I 
saw your report, Lescure. Want to 
elaborate on it?” 

Colonel Lescure cleared his 
throat. “After a suggestion by Mr. 
Ryeland,” he said, nodding, “we in- 
stituted a new series of X-ray ex- 
aminations of the spaceling. By 
shadowgraphing its interior and us- 
ing remote-chromotography analytic 
techniques I have discovered a sort 
of crystalline mass at the conflux 
of its major nervous canals. This is 
in accordance with the prediction 
made by Mr. Ryeland.” 

Fleemer demanded harshly: 
“What does it mean?” 

Ryeland said eagerly: “It means ‘ 
we’re making headway! There had 
to be some sort of such arrange- 
ment for controlling and directing 
the jetless drive. After yesterday’s 
computer run, and some further 
calculations Oporto did for me, I 
asked Colonel Lescure to make the 
tests. He did — on overtime, as 
you see. 

“What this means,” he said, begin- 
ning to lecture, “is that we have 
found where the spaceling’s force is 
generated and directed. And there’s 
one other thing we learned from 
yesterday’s calculations. Phase-rule 
analysis indicates zero possibility of 
any electromagnetic or gravitic 
force. I have the report here, ready 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 




for transmission to the Machine.” 

General Fleemer nodded slowly, 
looking at Ryeland. After a moment 
he said, “Does it account for what 
happened to the mining colonies in 
Antarctica?” 

Ryeland was puzzled. “I don’t un- 
derstand. 

“No? I refer to the explosion of 
the power reactor last night, which 
destroyed them, at a very great loss 
to the Plan of Man. Not the only 
loss, Ryeland. A spaceship has been 
lost through a failure of its helical 
field accelerator. The same helical 
field which was involved in the re- 
actor explosion — and in other ac- 
cidents, Ryeland. The same field 
which you helped to design.” 

“The design is not to blame,” Rye- 
land protested desperately. “If there 
have been accidents, they must be 
due to mechanical failure or human 
error or deliberate sabotage — ” 

“Exactly!” 

“How could I be to blame for 
accidents in Antarctica and a hun- 
dred miles down and out beyond 
the Moon?” 

“That’s exactly what the Machine 
will want to know.” 

“Perhaps it is only chance,” he 
suggested wildly. “Coincidence. Ac- 
cidents have happened in series be- 
fore — ” 

“When?” 

“I don’t remember, I — I can’t 
recall.” 

He stammered and gulped, and 
walked away. The veil of gray fog 
across his past was thicker. Every- 
thing except his science was a swirl 
of unreality and contradiction. 

Alone in his room, he tried again 



to come to grips with that old riddle 
of the three days missing from his 
life. What had the therapists sus- 
pected that he had done in that lost 
interval? Why had they expected 
him to know anything about a call 
from Dan Horrock, or about fu- 
sorians and pyropods and spacelings 
or about how to design a reaction- 
less drive? 

Lescure’s story had given him 
clues, but they were too fragmen- 
tary to make much sense. Horrock 
had left the Cristobal Colon with 
unauthorized specimens and de- 
scriptions of the life of space. Did 
the Machine suspect that he had 
been in contact with Ryeland, be- 
fore he was recaptured and con- 
signed to the Body Bank? 

Ryeland turned the puzzle over, 
and saw no light. 

According to Donna Creery, 
there had really been three days 
between the knocking on his door 
and the arrival of the Plan Police. 
Had the knocking he remembered 
really been Horrock? 

If so, what had erased his mem- 
ory? 

He stared at the wall and probed 
through the fog in his mind. He 
tried to remember Horrock, still 
perhaps in his uniform, soiled from 
his flight, perhaps bleeding from 
some wound, panting with terror 
and exhaustion, lugging the black 
canvas space bag that held his stolen 
notes and specimens — 

The images had become queerly 
real. Were they all imagination? 

Had Horrock brought him some 
information vital to the invention of 
a jetless drive? He couldn’t recall. 

IF 



70 




He fell at last into a restless sleep, 
into a nightmare in which he and 
Horrock were in flight from the 
Plan Police. 

T he next morning Ryeland went 
directly from his room to the 
spaceling’s cage in the rocket pit 
— and stopped, appalled. 

The spaceling lay crushed and 
bleeding in its cage. 

Ryeland ran to the cage and let 
himself in. The creature had grown 
to know him. It lay wrapped in a 
fading glow of misty green, eyes 
dulled; but as he entered its eyes 
brightened angrily. It lifted off the 
floor. Suddenly apprehensive, Rye- 
land dodged outside and slammed 
the cage door — just in time. The 
spaceling darted toward him with 
flashing speed. The cage rocked as 
she struck the do Jng door. Anchor 
chains clanked. Fresh blood ran 
down the bars, and a flan of golden 
fur was torn loose. She collapsed 
again, mewing piteously. 

Ryeland felt the first real rage 
he had known in years. 

He spun on his heel. “Gottling!” 
he bawled. “What the devil have you 
been up to?’* 

The colonel appeared, looking 
sardonically self-satisfied. “Mr. Rye- 
land,” he nodded. 

Ryeland took a firm grip on him- 
self. Gottling looked more like a 
skull than ever, the radar horns 
giving a Satanic expression to a face 
that was cold and cruel enough to 
begin with. 

But those radar horns were not 
merely ornament. Team leader or 
not, Ryeland was a risk. The cold. 



complacent smile that twisted the 
corners of Gottling’s thin lips was 
enough of a reminder of their rela- 
tive status. One touch of the radar 
button on Gottling’s harness and it 
was the end of Ryeland. 

But this was too much. Ryeland 
blazed: “You’ve been torturing the 
thing again!” 

“I suppose so,” Gottling agreed 
mildly. 

“Damn you! My orders were — ” 
''Shut up, Risk!” There was no 
smile at all now. Gottling thrust a 
telctape at Ryeland. “Before you go 
too far, read this!” 

Ryeland hesitated, then took the 
tape. It read: 

Information. Agreed present 
line of investigation unnecces- 
sarily slow. Information. Dan- 
ger of additional accidents pos- 
sibly related Ryeland method of 
research must be investigated. 
Information. Possibility Rye- 
land engaged in direct sabo- 
tage subtrains, reactors, ion 
drives. Action. Direction of 
Team project returned to Gen- 
eral Fleemer. Action. Supple- 
mentary lines to be initiated at 
discretion Colonel Gottling. 

Ryeland stared at it, dazed. The 
Machine had reversed itself againi 
But in truth it wasn’t his own 
position, difficult though it had sud- 
denly become, that concerned him. 
It was the spaceling. “Supplemen- 
tary lines!” he thundered. “Man, 
you’ll kill her!” 

Gottling shrugged, contemplating 
the spaceling. It lay gasping on the 
steel floor, looking up at them.

“Perhaps I will not wait for her 
to die,” the colonel said meditative- 
ly. “Pascal does not wish to perform 
a vivisection, but he would hardly 
dare refuse the orders of the Ma- 
chine, Even he.” He smiled frostily 
and commented: “You are all alike, 
Pascal Lescure and the Planner’s 
daughter and you. Risk. Blood 
frightens you. But pain is not conta- 
gious. You need not fear to observe 
it in others, it will not infect you. 
Indeed,” he beamed, “there is much 
to learn in the pain of others.” 
Ryeland said tightly: “I’m going 
to report this to Donna Creery.” 

The colonel widened his eyes. 
“Oh? You need the Planner’s daugh- 
ter to fight your battles?” He al- 
lowed a silence to hang over them 
for a moment. Then, forgivingly: 
“But it does not matter, for you 
will not find that possible, Ryeland. 
Miss Creery is on the Moon. So you 
see, Risk, what happens to the 
spaceling from now on is entirely 
up to me.” 

VIII 

R yeland flung open the door 
of his room and headed for 
the teletype in the corner. Oporto 
and the Togetherness girl were 
there. He paused, distracted for a 
moment; he seemed to have inter- 
rupted something, but what? It 
didn’t matter. He barked: “Oporto! 
What’s Donna Creery’s call num- 
ber?” 

Oporto coughed. “Gee, Steve. I 
don’t know. Three? Fifteen?” 

“Cut it out, Oporto,” Ryeland 
warned dangerously. 



“Three.” Ryeland thumped the 
teletype keyboard: 

Query. Permission for direct 
hookup communication Donna 
Creery station 3. 

The teletype hardly hesitated: 

Information. Refused. 

“Well,” Oporto said reasonably, 
“what did you expect? The Machine 
can’t have its circuits tied up with — ” 
“Shut up.” Ryeland was typing 
again, demanding a connection with 
the Planner himself. 

Information. Refused. 

“You see, Steve? You aren’t get- 
ting anywhere. What’s got you so 
steamed up ?” 

Ryeland told him in half a dozen 
sentences what was getting him so 
steamed up. “Oh, that’s too bad,” 
murmured the Togetherness girl. 
“The poor thing.” 

Oporto seconded: “Tough. Well, 
what are you going to do? We’re 
only Risks. We can’t buck Gottling 
and all those.” He sneezed, and com- 
plained: “See, Steve, you’re gedding 
me all upset. I bet I’m catching a 
code.” 

Ryeland looked at him blankly; 
be had not heard what Oporto had 
said, and hardly knew the other two 
were in the room with him. What 
could he do? Cut off from the 
Planner or his daughter, he had no 
chance to keep Gottling from mur- 
dering the spaceling. That was the 
end of the project. If what the Plan- 
ner had told him was true, it actual- 

IF 



72 




ly endangered the Plan itself; for the 
jetless drive, the spaceling’s queer 
method of propulsion, was import- 
ant to the safety of all the Plan. 
Yet the Planning Machine would 
not allow him to — 

He blinked and the room came 
into focus. “The Planning Machine!” 
he said aloud. 

“What? Steve,” moaned Oporto, 
''now what are you going to do?” 
But Ryeland didn’t answer. He sat 
at the keyboard of the machine and 
with a steady hand tapped out an 
account of what had happened. Col- 
onel Gottling had deliberately con- 
troverted the orders of Donna 
Creery and the Machine itself. The 
spaceling was in danger. The Plan 
itself was threatened. He finished, 
and waited. 

And waited. 

And waited for long minutes, 
while Oporto and the girl whispered 
behind him. It was incredible that 
the Machine should take so long to 
answer! Ryeland asked himself fev- 
erishly: Was it turned on, was the 
wire cut, could it be possible that 
the Machine’s circuits were so over- 
loaded that the message was not 
received? He was actually bending 
over, hardly aware of what he was 
doing, to be sure that the machine 
was properly plugged in when 
abruptly it whirred and rattled. 

Ryeland was up like a shot. 

But the message was unbelievably 
short. It said only: 

R. 

“Received and understood,” Opor- 
to said sympathetically from behind 



him. “Gee, Steve. That’s all? WeU, 
that’s the Machine for you. It isn’t 
up to us to question — Steve. Hey. 
Steve! Where are you going?” But 
Ryeland was already gone. 

R yeland hurried down the cor- 
ridors to General Fleemer’s 
quarters. He had wasted time and 
it was now late; he would be 
waking the general up, but he didn’t 
care about that, not now. He tapped 
on the door and then, without oaus- 
ing, banged hard. 

“A minute, a minute,” mumbled 
a grumpy voice. A wait. Then the 
door was flung open. 

General Fleemer was in lounging 
pajamas, bright purple tunic, striped 
purple and scarlet pants. The collar 
and cuffs were picked out in silver 
braid, and the room behind him was 
silver. Silver walls, silver-mounted 
furniture on a silvery rug. It was a 
startling effect. Fleemer growled 
irritably: “Ryeland? What the devil 
do you want?” 

“I have to talk to you. General.” 
He didn’t wait for an invitation, but 
slipped past him into the room. 
Then something stopped him and 
he paused, stared, distracted even 
from the important mission he was 
on. 

There was a statue by the fire- 
place, a bright silver statue of a 
girl. But it moved! It opened silver 
eyelids and looked at him. With 
pink-tinged lips, like metallic copper 
in a silver face, it said: “Who is this 
one?” 

“Go in the other room!” the gen- 
eral barked. The silver statue 
shrugged and stood up. It was no 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 



73 




statue but a girl; the motion re- 
vealed it as she stared at Ryeland 
and left. 

Ryeland blinked. Dusted with 
silver to look like living metal, even 
her hair silver — the general had 
a remarkable private life. But it 
was no business of Ryeland’s at this 
moment. He said briskly: ‘^Sir, Col- 
onel Gottling is about to destroy 
the spaceling. I’m afraid he is delib- 
erately trying to sabotage the proj- 
ect.’^ 

Suddenly the general was no 
longer a cross, sleepy little fuss- 
budget. His cat’s eyes slitted down, 
his face abruptly became stone. ‘‘Go 
on,” he said after a second. 

“Why — that’s all there is, sir. 
Isn’t it enough? If Colonel Gottling 
goes ahead with vivisection it will 
kill the creature, I’m certain. Miss 
Creery left specific orders — ” 

“Wait,” said the general, but did 
not invite him to sit down. He turn- 
ed his back to Ryeland and strode 
over to his desk. He pressed a but- 
ton on his desk phone and leaned 
over to yell into it. “Gottling? Get 
down to my quarters. Ryeland’s 
here.” 

Mumble-mumble from the desk 
phone. It was directional; Ryeland 
couldn’t understand the wo.»*ds and 
wasn’t meant to. “On the double!” 
the general barked, cutting off dis- 
cussion, and broke the connection. 
Without looking at Ryeland he 
slumped in a chair, shading his eyes 
with his hands, and remained there 
until there was a crisp knock at the 
door. 

Colonel Gottling walked in. He 
did not seem disturbed, not in the 



least. And he was not alone. Ma- 
chine Major Chatterji came smiling 
and bowing behind him. “What a 
lovely room, General! Oh, really 
lovely. It takes exquisite taste to 
transform our dreary barracks in- 
to — ” 

“Shut up.” General Fleemer stood. 
Ryeland waited, poised for what- 
ever excuse Gottling might offer, 
ready to confront him with the facts 
as soon as the general began his ac- 
cusation. 

But the general did not begin. 
The general did not speak to Got- 
tling at all. He said: “All right, Chat- 
terji, have you got the orders?” 
“Yes, General. Certainly! Here 
you are. I knew you’d be wanting 
them, so — ” The general moved 
slightly and Chatterji was still. 
Fleemer took a sheet of teletype 
communication paper from the ma- 
jor’s hand and passed it to Ryeland 
without comment. Ryeland glanced 
puzzlcdly at it. 

Then he felt a sudden quick 
burning sen.sation, as though a knife 
had reached him unsuspected. The 
message said: 

Information. Ryeland, Steven, 
Risk, change of status approved. 
Action. Subject will therefore 
be transported to stockpile HJK 
without delay. 

“Stockpile HJK?” Ryeland re- 
peated aloud. He shook his head, 
dazed. “But — there’s got to be 
some mistake here, because, look, 
stockpile HJK is Heaven. I mean — ” 
“You mean the Body Bank, as it 
is otherwise known.” General Fleem- 
er nodded wisely. “That’s correct, 

IF 



74 




and that is where you’re going. You 
were perfectly right about Gottling 
sabotaging the Project, you see. 
Your only mistake was in thinking 
that he was alone,” 

IX 

H eaven was on the island of 
Cuba. 

The subtrain took nearly an hour 
to get there. Ryeland hardly noticed. 
They rode in a rrray steel ball, far 
less luxurious than the Planner’s 
private car. When they stopped, 
Ryeland, still dazed, still shocked, 
got out and blinked at a massive 
concrete archway over a steel gate. 
The letter in the concrete read: 

Resurrection under the Plan 

The station was gray concrete. 
Air ducts blew a clammy breath at 
them. A guard in white, a red heart 
stitched on the breast of his tunic, 
came forward to take charge. 

The major who had convoyed 
Ryeland’s detail, tvventy^two new 
cadavers for the Body Bank, turned 
them over gratefully and went back 
into the subtrain without a look. 
He didn’t like this escort detail. No 
one did. It was a reminder of mor- 
tality; even a machine major could 
be made to realize that one bad 
blunder, or one bad break, could 
put him in Heaven too. ''Come on!” 
bawled the guard, and apathetically 
the twenty-two walking collections 
of spare parts followed him through 
the gate. 

A narrow corridor. A long rec- 
tangular room, with wooden 



benches. Ryeland sat and waited 
and, one by one, they were admitted 
to a smaller room. When it was his 
turn Ryeland walked through the 
door and a girl grasped his arm, 
thrusting it under the black-light. 
Her hair was red, the same bright 
red as the heart that was stitched 
on her uniform. Under the light his 
tattoo glowed faintly. She read off 
his name and number in a rapid 
drone. "Steven Ryeland,” she said 
in the same continuous drone, "when 
you entered this gate you leave life 
behind as an individual you have 
failed to justify your place in the 
Plan the tissues of — ” 

She yawned sharply. She shook 
her head and grinned. "Excuse me. 
Where was I? The tissues of your 
body however may still serve the 
Plan before you enter have you any- 
thing to say?” 

Ryeland thought. What was there 
to say? He shook his head. 

"Go ahead, then. Through that 
door,” said the girl. 

Behind Ryeland the door clanged 
with a steel finality. 

irst there were tests. 

Ryeland was shipped, scrubbed 
weighed, measured. X-rayed, blood- 
tested, tissue-tested, ascaulted, palp- 
ed and all but sniffed and tasted. 
A bit of his flesh was snipped and 
whisked to a complex bench where 
a team of girls put it through a 
process of staining and microscopy. 
From their studies a genetic map 
was made of his chromosomes, every 
allele and allomorph in place, and 
coded into binary symbols which 
were stamped on his collar. 




THE REEFS OF SPACE

It was interesting. Transplants of 
body organs did not survive, not 
even with suppressants, if the donor 
and subject were too different in 
their genetic makeup. Antibodies 
formed. The new tissue was attacked 
by the environment it found itself 
in. It died. So, usually, did the pa- 
tient. The more delicate the tissue 
involved, the closer the genetic re- 
semblance had to be. It was an old 
story. Any cornea can be imbedded 
in any other eye; the tissues are 
crude and simple, mostly water. 
Millions of humans can transfer 
blood from one to another — blood 
is a tissue little more complex than 
the cornea. 

But the more highly specialized 
members are transferable, without 
suppressants, only between identical 
twins. Suppressants — something 
like the allergy-controlling phar- 
maceuticals which once helped hold 
down hay fever — can make the 
range of tolerance broader; but, 
even so, genetic patterns must be 
matched as closely as possible. It 
was good that it was interesting. 
Ryeland was able to keep his mind 
on it. He did not find himself dwell- 
ing on the fact that he was now in 
the position of the spaceling under 
Gottling. He did not have to con- 
template the prospect of what was 
essentially (however gentle, however 
carefully anesthetized for him) the 
Death of a Thousand Cuts. 

And then they turned him loose, 
without warning. 

He had expected a cell. He was 
given a millionaire’s playground. 
He tripped over a tuft of grass and, 
blinking in warm Caribbean after- 



noon sun, found himself in a broad 
park, with trees and comfortable- 
looking cabins. He started forward, 
then happened to think of something 
and returned to the guard. *'What 
do I do now? Who do I report to?” 
‘‘Nobody,” said the guard, gently 
closing the door. “Nobody at all, 
any more.” 

R yeland walked down a broad 
green lane toward the glint of 
water, it was as good a direction to 
go as any. He had never in all his 
life before had the experience of 
being without orders. It was almost 
more disturbing than the sure pros- 
pect of dismemberment that lay be- 
fore him. He was so absorbed in 
the feeling that he hardly heard 
someone calling to him until the 
man raised his voice. “You! Hey, 
you new fellow! Come back here!” 
Ryeland turned. 

The man who was calling him 
was about fifty years old — the 
prime of life. He should have been 
a husky, bronzed creature with all 
his hair. Statistically he should hard- 
ly have needed even glasses. Forty 
good years should still be ahead of 
him at least. 

But the man who limp-stumped 
up to Ryeland had none of these 
things. He was totally bald. (In a 
moment, as the sunlight caught it, 
Ryeland saw that what had seemed 
to be the man’s scalp was a plastic 
covering.) He walked with a shoul- 
der-cane — almost a crutch. And 
what he walked on were not flesh- 
and-blood feet but prosthetic appli- 
ances. One eye was only a patch; 
the other was drawn into a squint

by another area of pink plastic that 
covered the place where once he 
had had an ear. 

“You! Did you just come in?” he 
cried. His voice was deep and vi- 
brant; that, at least, he had kept. 

Ryeland said, keeping his expres- 
sion polite with some difficulty, 
“Yes, that’s right. My name is Steve 
Ryeland.” 

“Never mind that. Do you play 
bridge?” 

The difficult expression collapsed 
for a second, but Ryeland got it 
back. “I’m afraid not.” 

“Damn.” When the man scowled 
it pointed up another peculiarity of 
his face. He had no eyebrows. “How 
about chess?” 

“Yes, a little.” 

“Speak up!” the man barked, turn- 
ing his good ear irritably to Rye- 
land. 

“T said yes!” 

“Well, that’s worth something,” 
the man said, grudging the words. 
“Um. Maybe you could learn bridge, 
hey? We’re a good house. No rough 
stuff, no stealing. And no basket 
cases.” He said proudly: “I’m the 
senior inmate in the house. Take a 
look at me. See? I’ve got plenty 
left.” 

Ryeland said slowly, “You mean 
I can pick out the house I live in? 
I don’t know the rules here yet.” 

“There aren’t any rules. Oh,” the 
man shrugged, “no fights resulting 
in bodily injury, no hazardous sports 
— they salvage you total for that 
sort of thing. You know. What 
you’ve got, it doesn’t belong to you 
any more. It’s the Plan’s and you’re 
supposed to take care of it.” He 



hitched himself forward on his 
shoulder-cane. “Well, what about it? 
You look all right to me. Take my 
advice and come in with us. Never 
mind what the other houses say — 
those Jupiters will be talking about 
their pingpong table, and what good 
is that when tomorrow morning 
you maybe won’t have what to play 
pingpong with!” He grinned confi- 
dentially, revealing a set of casually 
placed artificial teeth. 

Ryeland went with the one-eyed 
man, whose name turned out to be 
Whitehurst. The man was a good 
salesman, but he had not exagger- 
ated the value of choosing the right 
hut. Ryeland could see that for him- 
self; some cottages had a rundown, 
disreputable air, the inmates loung- 
ing around, surly and bored. White- 
hurst’s house was busy if nothing 
else. 

It was amazing, but Ryeland 
found Heaven rather pleasant. There 
was food — good food, Whitehurst 
told him proudly, no synthetics or 
retreads! (The tissues had to be kept 
up.) There was plenty of leisure. 
(The patient had* to be always in 
shape for major surgery.) There was 
. well . freedom, said White- 
hurst, almost embarrassed as he 
said it and unwilling to explain. But 
Ryeland found out that it was so. 
If Heaven was a jail, at least the 
walls were out of sight. There was 
no fear of making a mistake and 
falling to ruin; there was no farther 
to fall. 

The physical plant was ideal. 
Small cottages dotted a green land- 
scape. Palms stood on green hills. 
There was a grove of oaks and 

IF 



78 




cedars by a lake, and the lake con- 
tained actual fish. The tropic sky 
was a permanent milky blue, with 
high-piled cumulus to give it life. 

Whitehurst’s cottage called them- 
selves the Dixie Presidents. No one 
remembered what doomed anti- 
quarian, generations before, had sel- 
ected the name, but it was the cus- 
tom to name each house and suc- 
ceeded inmates kept the names; it 
was a tradition. The Dixie Presidents 
were an all-male cottage, by choice. 
It was up to the inmates. Not all 
the houses were so monastic. There 
were as many women as men in 
Heaven, and the co-ed cottages were 
given to wild sounds late at night. 
But that was up to the inmates too. 

Listening to the evening conver- 
sation of his fellow inmates, Rye- 
land found a few things which struck 
him as odd. The cottage across the 
way was occupied by a family 
group. Strange! Their name was 
Minton — Mr. Minton, Mrs. Min- 
ton and their five grown children. 
What mass crime had the Minton 
family committed to be scrapped en 
masse? It was queer. 

The principle that lay behind the 
Body Bank he knew well. It had 
been explained to him in detail on 
his travel orders, even if he had been 
the one man alive under the Plan 
who didn’t know all about it from 
infancy. Each human under the 
Plan of Man was required to make 
a contribution toward the good of 
all. If inefficiency, malevolence or 
carelessness kept him from doing 
what he was asked, he would then 
be permitted to contribute in an- 
other way. He would be scrapped. 



His limbs and organs would be put 
to the use of more valuable citizens, 
replacing parts damaged through 
accident or disease. 

It was a project more attractive 
to the recipient than to the donor, 
of course. Yet it did have a sort of 
rough justice, and Ryeland thought 
he could bring himself to tolerate 
whatever might happen — the 
world’s good was more important 
than his own! 

And yet. 

One thing did bother him. In hii 
life he had known or heard of a 
fair number of persons who had 
been scrapped for the salvage of 
their parts in the Body Bank. 

And yet he could not remember 
ever, not even once, having en- 
countered a man who had benefited 
from these organs. 

Now at last, when it was too late 
to matter, Ryeland had time to re- 
turn to the riddle of his three miss- 
ing days. He was tormented with 
the possibility that he had once 
known a precious secret which could 
somehow transform the Plan of 
Man — if he could just recall it. 

That night after he had watched 
the bridge game for a few minutes 
he lay trying to remember. Had 
there been a knocking twice on his 
door, on Friday and again on Mon- 
day? If Horrock had really come to 
him, what message could he have 
brought? Even if a jetless drive 
could be invented, how could it 
threaten the Plan? Who besides 
Donderevo was free from the Ma- 
chine? 

He found no answers. The fog 
was thicker in his memory. Even 



THE REEFS OF SPACE

the fat, apologetic face of Dr. 
Thrale was growing dim. He no 
longer flinched when he remem- 
bered the cold electrodes clamped 
on his body. He fell asleep and 
dreamed that he had discovered a 
jetless drive. 

It was a broomstick. He rode it 
through a jungle of five-pointed tin- 
sel stars, with General Fleemer 
astride a spaceling close behind him. 
Fleemer was goading and spurring 
the spaceling, and it was screaming 
horribly. 

an eveille! Reveille! Everybody 

IVup!” 

Ryeland woke up with a start; 
he had been dreaming that he was 
in the Body Bank, in an unusually 
soft bed, and woke to found it true. 
He sat blinking at the bunk across 
from him. It looked more like a 
surgical supply house than a human 
being’s bed. The cords of a bone- 
conduction hearing aid dangled 
from the stainless-steel shafts of a 
prosthetic arm. A self-powered 
wheelchair bore ten pounds of as- 
sorted steel, copper, rubber and 
plastic. As in the ancient joke about 
the wedding night, there was more 
of Ryeland’s roommate on the bu- 
reau than in the bed. 

The roommate was a plump man 
of rosy complexion, what there was 
left of it, and ill temper. His name 
was Alden. “Come on, Ryeland,” he 
screeched faintly in the high-pitched 
whisper of the newly deaf. “You 
know the rules of the house. Give 
me a hand.” 

“All right.” There was plenty of 
time before morning shape-up and 

80 



breakfast, so Ryeland had been told; 
there had to be, for the senior 
members of the community needed 
plenty of time to get their miscel- 
laneous artificial parts in place. As 
a newcomer, still complete in his 
organs, Ryeland had obligations. 
The juniors took care of the seniors. 
Seniority ruled — not age, but 
length of time in Heaven. It was a 
fair system, it was explained to Rye- 
land, and it was enlightened self- 
interest besides. “You’ll find out,” 
Whitehurst had said grimly. “Wait 
till you’re missing a few little 
chunks.” 

In the morning the conversation 
was less placid, less polite than at 
night. It was odd too, thought Rye- 
land, listening carefully. In the 
morning the one universal topic was 
Escape. Perhaps it was only the 
wake-up irritability of the normal 
human, but even the advanced bas- 
ket cases from the huts next door 
laid their plans and carefully meas- 
ured the daily patrol of the guard 
helicopters. Alden muttered for 
twenty minutes about the chance of 
swimming to a miraculously bor- 
rowed fishing submarine that some 
incredibly loyal friend from Life 
might arrange to have out beyond 
the breakers. It was foolish, it was 
pathetic. There was hardly enough 
left of him to bother escaping with. 
And his tone the night before had 
been bland resignation: “You’ll learn, 
my boy,” he told Ryeland, “we’re 
here for a reason. It’s right.” It was 
puzzling. 

In the night Ryeland had been 
bothered by something sticking him 
in the ribs. 



IF 




Once Alden was wheeled away 
he searched, and there, thrust un- 
der the seams of the mattress, was 
a flat aluminum case. He opened 
and spilled out lump sugar, maps, 
terribly amateurish faked travel or- 
ders from the Machine. And a 
journal. 

The journal was the work of some 
previous occupant who signed him- 
self only by initials — D.W.H. — 
and it covered a period of almost 
three years. The first entry was sober 
self-appraisal : 

June 16. I arrived in Heaven 
this morning. I canT get out. 

If I did get out, there would be 
no place to go. But if I let my- 
self give up the hope of some- 
how getting out I might as well 
be dead. Therefore I will try to 
escape. And I will not brood. 

The last entry, in a palsied hand, 
was less sober, less analytic: 

May the — what? 9th, maybe. 
Just a min. bfr shape-up. I 
think IVe got it! Nbdy ever 
looks at the scrap-heap carcass- 
es! IVe seen some that look bet- 
ter than I do now and, whoosh, 
they’re down the chute & out 
on the barge when they clean 
up. So tonight’s the night. All 
I have to dc is pass one more 
shape-up. I’ve plenty left. 
Aprnces don’t matter. If I can 
just — There’s the bell. More Itr. 

The remaining pages were blank. 

B reakfast came before the morning 
shape-up and Ryeland, stuffing 
the journal back in the mattress, went 
thoughtfully out to eat. 



The food was all Whitehurst had 
promised! There was no rationing 
here, none at all. Sugar. Coffee. 
Real, thick cream. Ham with red 
gravy; cereal with more of the 
thick cream; fruits and hot biscuits. 

Ryeland ate until his stomach 
bulged. He began to feel better. The 
world seemed calmer, brighter; his 
housemates left off grumbling and 
plotting and began to laugh and 
shout along the long tables. 

Ryeland sat next to Whitehurst 
and brought up the subject of the 
previous occupant of his bunk. 

'‘Oh, him,” said the one-eyed man 
“Old Danny. He was here for ever, 
considering. I mean, he must have 
been a very popular type, they took 
so much of him. I thought they’d 
never salvage him total, though all 
he had keeping him going at the 
end was a whirl-pump heart and 
twice a day filtrations on the kidney 
machine. Funny thing about Danny, 
his bidding was good enough but 
when he played a hand — ” 

“What happened to him?” 

Whitehurst scowled. “Took both 
lungs at one time. Pity, too. He still 
had two arms, clear down to the 
fingers.” 

The bell summoned them out to 
the morning shape-up. 

There were three of them a day, 
Whitehurst whispered, and you had 
to be present. Otherwise total sal- 
vage, right away. The white guards 
with red hearts appliqued on their 
tunics moved up and down the 
ragged lines, checking the tattooed 
identification against lists. “Gutnick, 
Fairweather, Breen, Morchant,” the 
one at the house of the Dixie Presi- 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 



81 




dents chanted, “Nothing for you 
boys. You can fall out, Alden, Hens- 
ley — Hensley? Say, how did that 
name get on the list? Wasn’t he 
scrapped last week?” Half a dozen 
voices agreed he had been; the 
guard scratched the name off his 
list. “Lousy administrative work. 
Say. Who are you?” He took Rye- 
land’s arm. “Oh, Steve Ryeland. 
Welcome to our little community. 
Nothing for you today, though. 
Whitehurst. Oh, yes. Come on, 
Whitehurst, you’re in business.” 

Ryeland got away as soon as he 
could. The others were laughing and 
relaxed, but seeing Whitehurst led 
away had chilled the soft warmth 
that had spread over Ryeland at 
breakfast. At any moment it might 
be his name that was on the list; 
if there was anything at all he could 
do about it, the time to do it was 
now. 

He retrieved the journal from his 
bed, escaped the back way and found 
a sunny spot on a hill. He sat down 
against a stone retaining wall and 
studied the diary of the late D.W.H. 

rhere was nothing about the 
man’s life-in-Life in his journal. But 
whatever he had been he was a man 
ot method and intelligence. He had 
begun by systematically investigat- 
ing his surroundings. From the first 
month’s entries Ryeland learned a 
number of possibly useful statistics. 
There had then been 327 inmates 
in Heaven, counting twelve children 
under the age of eighteen (and what 
had they done to be here?) This 
was not the only Heaven; there 
probably were a number of others; 
twice shipments of inmates had gone 



out through the gate, to replenish 
another Heaven te^f^arily low in 
stock. There were never any guards 
inside the walls except at the shape- 
ups. Usually about a dozen came 
in then, and D.W.H. had once been 
able to count the outside guards at 
fifteen more. Heaven roamed over 
nearly a hundred acres, and there 
was a map, heavily erased and re- 
drawn, tucked into the journal. A 
note on the map told Ryeland that 
the walls were electrified and im- 
penetrable, even down to a depth 
of fifty yards under the surface. Ap- 
parently someone had actually dug 
that far! 

The beach was not fenced, but 
there was a heavy steel net and, 
beyond that, a persuasive tradition 
of sharks. The only other break in 
the wall was the building through 
which he had entered, and its satel- 
lite structures — the clinic, the ad- 
ministration building, the power- 
house. And the sanitation building. 
It was there that the “scrap-heap” 
had attracted D.W.H. ’s attention. 
It was near the beach, and a chute 
led to a barge which, towed to sea, 
disposed of the left-over parts of the 
inmates as well as the more ordinary 
wastes of a community of several 
hundred. 

Ryeland mused thoughtfully over 
the map Only the scrap disposal 
chute looked promising. Yet the 
writer had not thought of it until 
after some months and, judging by 
the increasingly panicked and in- 
coherent quality of his notes, his 
judgment must by then have begun 
to deteriorate. Still, it was worth a 
thought. He said a man could es- 




cape that way. Perhaps a man 
could. 

If he had a place to escape to. 
Ryeland put that thought out of 
his mind and read industriously in 
the journal until movements outside 
the cottages revealed that it was 
time for the mid-day shape-up. 

X 

N o Dixie President was called 
at noon. Only when they 
were dismissed did Pvyeland real- 
ize he had been holding his breath 
almost continuously. Gutnick, the 
man next to him in line, winked and 
said; “It gets you that way at first. 
It keeps on getting you that way 
too.” 

Ryeland said only: “What’s that?” 
Gutnick turned and looked. Down 
the gravel path two guards were 
solemnly pushing a wiicelchair and 
a handtruck of appliances. All were 
connected to the occupant of the 
wheelchair. There was little left of 
the man, if it was a man. All of his 
head was swathed in bandages — ■ 
if that was his head Only a little 
gap showed where the mouth was. 
The auxiliary handtruck carried a 
considerable array of pumps and 
tubing, stainless-steel cylinders and 
electric equipment. 

Gutnick said, “Oh, him.” Gutnick 
could not wave, as both his arms 
had been needed elsewhere, but he 
inclined his torso and called: “Hi, 
Alec. What did you lose this time?” 
The bandaged head moved faint- 
ly. Nothing else moved on the man. 
The nearly invisible lips parted to 
gasp, in words li- ;i^-ffs of smoke. 

THE REEFS OF SPACE 



“That you, Gutnick? Just the other 
kidney, I think.” 

“You’ve got plenty left,” lied 
Gutnick cheerfully, and they went 
in to lunch. Ryeland could not get 
the basket case out of his mind. 

“I didn’t think they bothered to 
keep us alive, with that much gone.” 
“I guess Steve’s something spe- 
cial. He’s senior in all Heaven. He’s 
been here — ” Gutnick’s voice was 
respectful — “almost six years.” 
Ryeland didn’t have much appe- 
tite; but after he’d taken a few bites 
he had to stop in order to feed Girt- 
nick anyway; and then he himself 
began to perk up. It was astonishing, 
he marveled after lunch, trudging 
aimlessly around the walks of Heav- 
en, how the food here made Hfe so 
bearable. It showed that a good diet 
made a happy man. It showed — ^ 
why, he thought with a sudden mis- 
erable flash of insight, it showed 
nothing at all except that even a 
doomed creature like himself could 
submerge the forebrain in a wal- 
low of physical pleasures. He deter- 
mined to go right back to the house 
and get the diary, study it, plan — 
Someone was calling his name. 

He turned, and Oddball Oporto 
was rushing toward him. “Gee! Rye- 
land! It’s you!” 

Oporto stopped. So did Ryeland; 
and then he realized that what they 
were doing was appraising each 
other, looking for missing parts. So 
soon it had become a habit in this 
place. 

“You don’t seem to be missing 
anything,” said Ryeland. 

“I’ve only been here two days. 
Got here right ahead of you — T 



83 




saw you come in. I guess you 
stopped to turn in your gear? They 
didn’t bother with that, with me. 
I should’ve stayed in Iceland, hey? 
Not that I hold it against you,” he 
finished glumly. 

“Sorry.” 

“Yeah. Well, where you living?” 
Ryeland told him about the Dixie 
Presidents, and Oporto was incred- 
ulous, “Gee! Those moldy old 
creeps? Say, why not come over to 
our place? There’s two vacancies 
right now, and some of the boys are 
real sharp. You know, you lose a 
few parts and there isn’t much left 
but the brain; so what you want is a 
few little problems to work on. 
Well, fellow next to me, he has a 
whole bunch of stuff from the Lila- 
vata — old Hindu math problems, 
mostly diophantine equations when 
you come down to it, but — ” 

Ryeland said gently: “I’m working 
on a different problem right now.” 
Oporto waited. 

“I want to get out of here.” 

“Oh, no. Wait a minute! Steve, 
don’t be crazy. A fellow like you, 
you’ve got years here. Plenty to 
look forward to. You don’t want 
to — ” 

“But I do want to,” said Ryeland, 
“1 want to get away. It isn’t just 
my life, though I admit that’s got a 
lot to do with it.” 

“What else? Oh. You don’t have 
to tell me. That girl.” 

“Not the girl. Or not exactly. But 
she’s part of it. Something bad’s 
happening with the spaceling and 
Colonel Gottling. It ought to be 
stopped.” 

Oporto said dismally, “Gee, Steve. 



You don’t want to talk like that 

Anyway — ” He stopped. 

Ryeland knew Oporto well 
enough to wait him out. He prompt- 
ed: “Anyway what?” 

“Anyway,” said Oporto with some 
hesitation, “I don’t know why you 
want to bother with her. I thought 
that other girl was more important 
to you. You know, 837552 — I for- 
get her name.” 

Ryeland took it like a blow be- 
tween the eyes. That number — 
he didn’t have Oporto’s queer mem- 
ory for any arithmetical function, 
but surely it was the number of. 

“Angela Zwick,” he whispered, 
remembering blonde hair, blue eyes 
and a mouth that testified against 
him at his hearing. 

“That’s the one. Well, now! So 
you didn’t forget her?” Oporto was 
enjoying his bombshell. “Why not 
go see her? She’s been here quite 
a while — over in a cottage by the 
lake.” 

“She’s really here? But she was 
with the Plan Police.” Ryeland was 
dazed. Had the Plan come to this, 
that it scrapped its own undercover 
agents? 

“Well,” said Oporto judiciously, “I 
guess you’d say she’s here. Anyway, 
there’s a quorum present. Why not 
go see for yourself?” 

T he first sensation was shock, 
and a terrible embarrassment. 
Ryeland scraped one foot against 
another, staring at the girl in the 
wheelchair. He said her name gruff- 
ly, and then he met her eyes and 
could say nothing else. Angela? This 
thing in the chair, was it the girl he 

IF 



84 




had known? She had no arms and, 
from the flatness of the lap robe 
that draped her, no legs either. But 
her face was intact, blue-green eyes, 
golden hair; her husky, warm voice 
was the voice he had known. 

“Steve! It’s good to see you!” She 
was not embarrassed at all, only 
amused. She laughed. “Don’t gawk. 
But I know how you feel. You’ve 
only just arrived, and I’ve been here 
twenty-one months.” 

Ryeland sat awkwardly on the 
grass before her. Her cottage lay 
in a little clump of woods, and there 
were neatly tended beds of flowers 
around it. Flowers! Ryeland could 
not remember ever having seen 
flowers around a dwelling before, 
only in parks. Though this was a 
kind of a park, at that. 

Angela said softly: “I wondered 
if I would ever see you again, after 
what happened.” She cocked her 
chin, and a tiny motor droned; the 
velvet-covered chin rest that sup- 
ported her head seemed to have 
switches in it, so that she could 
move the wheels of her chair. Fac- 
ing him, she said seriously: “You 
don’t blame me, do you?” 

Ryeland muttered: “You did your 
job under the Plan.” 

“So wise of you to say that, Steve. 
Ah, Steve! I’m glad to see you again.” 
She lifted her lovely chin. “We’ve 
got so much to talk about. Take 
me down by the lake,” she com- 
manded. 

For nearly three years Ryeland 
had rehearsed the speeches he would 
make to Angela Zwick if ever they 
chanced to come together, but in 
this place they were all wrong, he 



85 



forgot the words. He had raged 
silently in his bed, he had pleaded 
with the stony fields of the isolation 
camp; now, facing the girl, he found 
himself engaged in a little conver- 
sation. They chatted. They laughed. 
It was pleasant. Pleasant! And she 
had put the collar around his neck. 

“There is always peace in serving 
the Plan,” she told him wisely, read- 
ing his mind. 

They stopped by the lake and he 
sat down. “I don’t even mind the 
collar any more,” he murmured, 
suppressing a yawn. 

“Of course not, Steve.” 

He scratched his shoulderblades 
against the bole of a palm. “1 never 
thought I’d stop minding that. Why, 
1 remember talking to a fellow 
about it in the isolation camp. He 
said I’d get over it. I said — ” 

He stopped, and frowned faintly. 
“What did you say to him, Steve?” 
“Why,” he said slowly, “I told him 
that I’d never stop hating the collar 
unless I was dead, or drugged.” 

She smiled at him with mandarin 
calm. 

B ack at the cottage of the 
Dixie Presidents, Ryeland 
thumbed through the journal that 
had once belonged to his predeces- 
sor in the bunk. There was an entry 
that he wanted to read again. 

He found it: 

This place is insidious. The at- 
mosphere is so tranquil — God 
knows how! — that it is very 
tempting to relax and let what 
happens happen. Today Cullen 
came back from th'^ clinic gig- 
gling because a nurse had told 



him a joke. He had lost both 
eyes! 

And two days later: 

Yesterday I lost my other leg. 

It is painful, but they gave me 
shots for that. I wonder why it 
doesn’t bother me. I keep think- 
ing of Cullen. 

Frowning, Ryeland closed the 
book and went out to stand in the 
afternoon shape m. The other Dixie 
Presidents were already there, and 
their greetings w re chill. Ryeland 
paid very little attention, although 
he knew they were annoyed because 
he had spent so little time conform- 
ing with the customs of the cottage. 
He hardly even noticed the guards, 
with their scarlet hearts blazoned 
on their white tunics, as they came 
droning down the line with their 
rolls. 

There was something more im- 
portant on his mind. 

Ryeland was reasonably sure that 
his mind was functioning as well as 
it ever had. But he was finding it 
hard to think this matter through. 
He didn’t mind the collar. That was 
the first term in the syllogism. 
Something in the diary supplied the 
second term. What was the con- 
clusion? 

“Come on, I said!” said a guard’s 
voice, annoyed, and Ryeland woke 
up to the fact that his name had been 
called. 

He gawked “Me? Are you calling 
me?” 

“You. That’s what I said, man! 
You’re on orders today. Come on 
to the tissue bank!”

T he group of scrapped men waited 
for the elevator. 

The man next to Rj^eland was 
whispering feverishly under his 
breath, his eyes fixed on the eleva- 
tor door as though it were the gate 
to hell. He caught Ryeland looking 
at him and threw him a wild smile. 
“First time for you? Me, too. But I 
figure it won’t be much, you know.” 
“All right, all right.” The guards 
began to herd them into the open- 
ing elevator door. “Move along, 
now!” 

The elevator dropped swiftly and 
let them out in an underground hall. 
Blue asepsis lamps winked on the 
walls, a hum from the air ducts 
told of purifiers at work. The guards 
ordered them to sit down. There 
were a dozen long, wooden benches. 
The waiting room was not at all 
crowded, though there were twenty 
or more walking cadavers in it. 
Ryeland looked around at them. 
Some seemed to have all their fa- 
culties and parts; if there was any- 
thing missing, it was not such as 
would appear on the surface. Many 
showed signs of being nibbled away 
— a leg missing, £" ear, a finger 
or two. And some ' were so much 
prosthesis, so little f ^h and blood, 
that it was a wonder that the sur- 
geons could find anything left to 
take from them. 

The nervous man switched seats 
to join Ryeland and hissed in his 
ear: “See, the way I see it, they’re 
not going to take much the first 
time. Why should they? For in- 
stance, your body might not trans- 



plant right. They can’t tell. They’ll 
have to do a couple little jobs first 
and see how they take, before they 
try anything big. I’m positive of 
that, friend. .” He stopped as the 
door opened, his eyes like a tor- 
tured kitten’s. But it was only a 
nurse walking through, and she paid 
no attention to them. 

Ryeland took time from his own 
worries to comfort the man. “That’s 
right,” he said. “That figures.” It 
didn’t, of course; the Plan knew 
all it had to know about them al- 
ready. But the nervous man seized 
at the reassurance. 

He babbled: “Now, all we have 
to worry about is something little. 
Maybe some clumsy oaf lost a 
couple of fingers somewhere. Well, 
they’ll take a finger. Or a couple of 
fingers. .” He glanced wonderingly 
at his hand. “A couple of fingers. 
They’ll take — But what’s that? 
You can spare them. Or a foot, 
maybe. But they aren’t going to 
take anything big the first time, be- 
cause — ” 

The door opened. 

A young, slim guard walked in. 
He was bored, and the look he gave 
the waiting cadavers was not in- 
tended for anything human. “Eck- 
roth?” he called, reading from a list. 
The man next to Ryeland jumped. 
“Come on!” 

The nervous man stared franti- 
cally at Ryeland, swallowed, stood 
up and left, into a door that closed, 
silent and final, behind him. 

Ryeland sat and waited. 

One by one the cadavers were 
summoned to their operating rooms 
to give to the Plan what the Plan 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 



87 




demanded of them. Ryeland watch- 
ed them, because it was better to 
think of them than to think about 
himself: the oldster with the fire- 
blue eyes, weeping into the maze 
of tubes that had replaced his 
breathing apparatus; the young girl 
with the curiously flat dressings 
along one side of her body; the men 
and women of all sizes and descrip- 
tions. Ryeland was almost the last 
of them all to be called. 

But at last it was his turn. A 
nurse beckoned to him. He stood up, 
feeling strangely empty. A queer 
premonitory tingling raced all over 
his peripheral nervous system, like 
a pain looking for its proper place 
to settle down and begin aching. 

What would it be? A foot, an 
arm, a set of teeth, some internal 
organs? 

“Oh, come on” said the nurse, 
looking ruffled. She was a pretty 
girl with red hair. She even wore a 
ring on her finger. Ryeland marvel- 
ed. This girl was engaged I Some- 
where there was a Plan-fearing man 
who looked at her with affection 
and warmth. And, here, she was 
the embodiment of something that 
was going to deprive Steve Ryeland 
of a part of his body. 

He walked stiffly after her. There 
was a roar in his ears: the drum- 
ming of his blood. It was very loud; 
he felt his heart thumping, very 
strong. Colors were bright, an anti- 
septic odor in the room was very 
sharp. His senses missed nothing. He 
felt the stiffness of his worn red 
uniform. The blue glare of the 
sterilamps was painfully bright. 

He was in a small room, domi- 



nated by a neat, high operating 
table, stainlessly white. 

Ryeland looked at the table and 
licked his lips. 

Unexpectedly the nurse giggled. 
“Oh, I swear. You cadavers take 
everything so hard. Don’t you know 
why you’re here?” 

Ryeland nodded stiffly. He knew 
very well. Still, it was odd that he 
didn’t see the bright metal gleam 
of instruments. 

She said, humorously exasper- 
ated: “I don’t think you do. Your 
blood, friend. That’s all I’m going 
to take from you today. Maybe 
next time it will be different, of 
course. But right now we only need 
half a liter of your good red blood.” 

F lat on his back, with his arm 
strapped to the table and a 
crisp, cool sheet covering his legs, 
Ryeland lay. He was watching his 
blood slowly fill a liter beaker up 
to a measured mark. His blood was 
wine-purple colored, and it seemed 
to flow very slowly. 

There was nothr at all painful 
about the process. Of course, it 
wasn’t exactly pure pleasure. There 
was a queer jumpy sensation in his 
skin, a sort of warning of something 
that might hurt — as though the 
nerve-ends, evolved to cope with 
grosser wounds and warn of instant- 
er dangers, did not know quite what 
to tell the brain, and could only ex- 
press a sort of worry. The tube 
made a faint vulgar sound from 
time to time, like a siphon sucking 
air, but there was no other noise. 
The nurse had left him. It was amaz- 
ing how still the world was. 

il 



88 




And it was amazing how clearly 
Ryeland could think. 

He was tranquil. 

More than that, he knew he was 
tranquil. 

More still, he was beginning to 
realize that he had been tranquil — 
stupidly, crazily tranquil — ever 
since he had arrived in the Body 
Bank! And so was everyone else! It 
accounted for the cheerful ampu- 
tees and his heedless roommates at 
the Dixie Presidents. Tranquil! But 
it was not natural, and so it was 
due to drugs. 

Ryeland lay lazily watching the 
thick froth at the top of the beaker 
of his blood and marveled that he 
had not seen it before. Even the 
man who wrote the diary had never 
seen it, though he had come so 
close. Drugs! 

The Plan of Man understood that 
there were circuits in the human 
brain not subject to reason. Self- 
preservation was one of them. The 
Machine would not risk a sudden 
flare-up of that instinct. The Ma- 
chine must have known that, what- 
ever the mood of the Body Bank’s 
raw materials as they went in, how- 
ever carefully conditioned to their 
duties under the Plan of Man, the 
threat of dismemberment and death 
could upset all conditioning. 

Therefore the Machine had taken 
steps. The obvious step — how was 
it that no one had seen it? — was 
to flood the cadavers with tran- 
quilizing drugs. 

The nurse came in. She tapped 
the beaker lightly with a finger, 
fussed with the tubes, and in a mo- 
ment deftly removed the needle 



from Ryeland*s arm. She was hum- 
ming to herself. She pressed an 
alcohol pad over the little puncture 
in his arm and ordered; “Hold it 
that way to keep the pad in place.” 
Ryeland was hardly listening. 
Tranquilizing drugs, he thought, like 
an echo; it explained everything. It 
explained why D.W.H.’s careful 
plans had come to nothing; before 
they could mature, the drive that 
would make them reality had been 
sapped. It explained why Ryeland 
himself had loafed for irretrievable 
days. The only astonishing thing was 
that he had found out. 

The nurse straightened his arm, 
plucked off the pad and pointed. 
“Out that way.” 

Ryeland started obediently out 
the door, then stopped, shocked to 
alertness at last. 

An orderly was guiding an elec- 
tric stretcher down the hall. On it, 
his eyes closed, lay the nervous man 
from Ry eland’s group of donors. 
He looked to be asleep. Surely he 
had lost something — but what? 
Arms were there, legs showed un- 
der the sheet, there was no mark 
on the motionless face. 

Ryeland said to the nurse: “Ex- 
cuse me. That fellow. What hap- 
pened with him?” 

The nurse peered past him. “Oh, 
that one.” A shade came down over 
her eyes. “That was a big one. Did 
you know him?” 

“Yes.” 

“I see.” After a second she said 
briskly: “We needed a whole spine. 
There wasn’t much point in trying 
to salvage any of the rest of him.” 
Ryeland stumbled out into the 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 



89 




corridor, following the corpse of the 
nervous man, who never again 
would have to be nervous. He 
glanced over his shoulder at the 
nurse and said: “Good-by.” 

She said: “Fll be seeing you.” 

O utside Heaven, thirteen billion 
human beings worked, studied, 
loved, quarreled and in general 
fulfilled their tiny assigned mis- 
sions under the Plan of Man. In 
Saskatchewan an engineer turned a 
switch and the side of a mountain 
lifted itself, grumbled and slid into 
a lake, revealing an open vein of 
low-grade uranium ore, one of the 
last deposits left to tap. In the hill- 
side town of Fiesole, in Italy, a 
Technicorps colonel made a field in- 
spection of the new reservoir. The 
water level had risen a gratifying 
nineteen inches since his last report. 
He observed, from his flat-bottom- 
ed boat, how a certain jumbled pile 
of masonry he remembered seeing 
was now almost entirely submerged; 
it was the Pitti Palace, but he had 
never heard the name. (The Ponte 
Vcccnio was already twenty feet 
under the bottom of his boat.) Un- 
der Honduras, a subtrain shaft col- 
lapsed and eighteen hundred migra- 
tory agricultural workers were 
simultaneously cremated and dis- 
solved in molten rock. The Planner, 
returned from the Moon, signed an 
order which would ultimately lower 
the level of the Mediterranean sea 
ninety feet, creating thousands of 
miles of new land around its dwin- 
dled shores and providing an enor- 
mous hydroelectric station at the 
Straits of Gibraltar. 



But on the isle of Cuba, no echo 
of these rumblings penetrated. 
Everything was calm. Everything 
was pleasant. And Steve Ryeland 
fought against it as hard as he could. 
He quarreled vigorously with his 
Dixie Presidents. The senior cadaver 
was hurt, shocked and mortified; as 
a consequence, half an hour later he 
lost count of trumps and suffered 
an eight-hundred point penalty in 
the afternoon’s bridge game. Rye- 
land was well pleased. Quarreling 
stimulated his adrenals. He went 
out to find someone else to quarrel 
with. 

His logical candidate was Angela, 
and he found her where he had 
left her, sunning herself in front of 
her cottage. “Steve, dear,” she whis- 
pered, but he did not want to be 
charmed. 

He said brutally: “I just made my 
first donation. Guess what it was?” 
He gave her a chance to scan him 
and look perturbed, then said: 
“Nothing much, only blood. Lucky, 
eh?” 

It was terribly bad manners. She 
said, “Yes, Steve, that’s lucky. Must 
we talk about it? Oh, I know! Let’s 
go down to the lake again. It’s warm 
today, and there’s bound to be a 
breeze at the fountains — ” 

“That’s all you care about, isn’t 
it?” 

“Stevel” 

“Food and comfort. Are those 
the only things that matter to you?” 

Angela said petulantly, “Steve, 
you’re in an unpleasant mood this 
afternoon. If you don’t want to 
come with me I’ll go alone.” 

“Do you care?”

IF 




She opened her mouth, closed it, 
looked at him and shook her head. 
She was angry; but she was also 
untouched by it. As Ryeland was 
an irritation, she removed herself 
from it. 

He stood there thoughtfully. Even 
after Angela had flounced away, 
as best a woman with neither arms 
nor legs can flounce, he stood there, 
thinking. Knowing that ther^ were 
tranquilizers flooding his blood- 
stream was one thing, knowing what 
to do about it was something else. 
He could keep his adrenal glands 
combating the drug by quarreling, 
even by exercising, but it was wear- 
ing. It would be better to keep the 
drug from his system in the first 
place. 

It was very simple. 

It needed only one thing, Ryeland 
saw. He would merely have to stop 
eating and drinking entirely. 

B y lunchtime the next day he 
began to see the flaws in that 
scheme. 

He had worked it out very care- 
fully. He had to eat something, oth- 
erwise he would die, and that would 
be no improvement at all. He settled 
on eating sugar. That day after the 
noon formation he entered the mess- 
hall, carried his tray to a corner — 
and abandoned it there, untouched. 
He filled his pockets with sugar, as 
inconspicuously as he could. !t was 
a calculated risk. All foods were sus- 
pect, sugar included. But even the 
thorough Machine would not be 
likely to bother with sugar. 

Of course, water was out of the 
question. Already Ryeland was be- 



ginning to feel parched. He thought 
of making a still, somehow, and 
purifying the water from the lake. 
It would attract attention . but 
he was getting very thirsty. 

He went to see Angela and tried 
to take his mind off his thirst. They 
roamed about, the girl in her re- 
markably agile wheeled chair. She 
found him hard to endure that day. 
They sat by the lake and Steve Rye- 
land stared at it longingly. Water, 
lovely and clear. Beautiful water. 
Sweet water! But it was the source 
for all the drinking water in Heav- 
en, and undoubtedly it was already 
treated. He talked about swimming 
and clinking ice in a glass and the 
spray from the prow of a boat until 
Angela, faintly exasperated, said: 
“Go swimming, then. No, don’t 
worry about me.” Gentle smile. “Td 
rather not, for reasons which are 
apparent, but you go ahead. It’s 
what you want, isn’t it?” 

And it was; but Ryeland refused 
vigorously until he thought of some- 
thing and then went to get a pair 
of trunks. Why not go swimming? 
It was a trick torpedoed sailors had 
learned centuries before. If one 
merely lay in the water and relaxed, 
it would help control thirst. It 
wouldn’t help much. But it would 
help a little — perhaps it would 
keep him alive until his brain was 
clear and he could think surely 
enough to find a way out. But, oh, 
that water was tempting! 

He lay in the shallows and played 
a sort of game. It was for high 
stakes, his whole life riding on the 
turn of the wheel. He let the water 
come up to his chin. He let it touch 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 



91 





his lip. He even let a few drops of 
it into his mouth; then he filled his 
mouth and held the water there. 

It would be so easy to swallow! 
So simple to ease his thirst! And 
surely, he said reasonably to him- 
self, his eyes closed against the 
thirst, swishing the water back and 
forth with his cheeks and enjoying 
the sensation, surely one little drink 
would be of no real importance. 

Sputtering and coughing, he 
floundered out of the lake. 

That had been a close one. But 
he had learned something; the thirst 
was a counter-irritant; already he 
was fully aware of things that had 



been tempered and dull even an 
hour before. The puncture inside 
his elbow hurt. The nurse had been 
clumsy with the needle. The denims 
had chafed his thighs raw — a poor 
fit, miserably poor — and what a 
joy, he exulted, to be able to real- 
ize it. 

Angela was looking at him sus- 
piciously. “What’s the matter with 
you?” she demanded. 

“Nothing.” 

“You act — oh, I don’t know. 
As if the Machine canceled your 
orders here. As though you were 
going to get rid of your collar.” 

And even that was not impossible, 




UOOUOU 





thought Ryeland. If only he could 
hold out until somehow, some way 
there was a chance. He toweled 
himself dry and said, '‘Why not? 
Donderevo did it.” 

“Steve,” she scolded, “that’s un- 
planned thinking! I’m disappointed 
in you. Nobody else can escape the 
way Donderevo did, and even if you 
could, your duty to the Plan — ” 
“Wait a minute.” He stopped 
toweling and turned to look at her. 
“What did you say? What do you 
know about Donderevo?” 

“I know how he escaped. After 
all, this is where he escaped from.” 
Ryeland heard a ripping sound, 



and glanced down to see that his 
hands, without command from his 
brain, had clenched so tightly on the 
towel that it had parted. He dropped 
it to the ground and whispered: 

A ngela writhed carelessly, angling 
her head to start the motors 
that turned her chair away from 
the sun. She frowned thought- 
fully, then said, “Well, 1 don’t sup- 
pose it would do any harm. You 
can’t possibly duplicate his escape. 
No one can.” 

“Angela! How did he do it?” 

“Not by any method you can fol- 
low, Steve.” Her smile teased him. 
“He found a group on the staff here 
who could be tempted into un- 
planned thinking — and he tempted 
them, with talk of space outside the 
Plan. He managed to corrupt them, 
with promises of freedom and 
wealth in the reefs of space. He 
bribed them to remove his collar — 
surgically.” 

“Huh?” 

“The thing was expertly planned, 
she said. “The disloyal surgeons 
forged the requisitions, and issued 
false documents. Donderevo was 
called out of the lineup one morn- 
ing, exactly in the ordinary way. In 
one operating theater, he was dis- 
assembled, down to the head and 
the spine. All the parts were rushed 
into the adjoining theater — and 
put back together, without the iron 
collar. 

“But don’t go getting any ideas,” 
she warned him. “Because the plot 
was eventually discovered. The sur- 
geons who had participated were 

w 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 





promptly junked. Unfortunately, by 
that time Donderevo had escaped.” 

‘‘How did he get away?” 

“That was the most important 
part,” she said. “You see, the sur- 
geons made a rather ingenious ef- 
fort to cover their tracks. They used 
junk parts to assemble a complete 
patchwork man inside the collar. 
This junk man took Donderevo’s 
place, until it was too late to trace 
him.” 

Ryeland shivered in the warm 
sunshine. That method of escape 
seemed gruesomely drastic, even if 
it had been open to him, which it 
was not. 

“Let’s do something more amus- 
ing,” Angela urged him. 

“There’s one more thing I want 
to know.” He looked at her, caught 
with an unpleasant fascination. 
“How did you happen to know all 
this?” 

She stretched her torso lazily in 
the sunshine, with a slow, graceful, 
serpentine movement. 

“1 suppose I can tell you, Steve.” 
She smiled at him confidentially. 
“Alter all, it’s no secret between us 
that 1 once worked for the Plan 
Police. The fact is that I first came 
here on the Donderevo case. It was 
not broken until I had managed to 
persuade one of the guilty surgeons 
to use the same method to help me 
escape.” 

She yawned, smiling with a feline 
satisfaction. 

“If you came here as a spy, why 
are you — ” 

He stopped, feeling a horrified 
embarrassment. 

‘*Why am I still here? Don’t be 



ashamed to ask that, Steve. I’m here 
because by the time I finished my 
task I was — well — as you see 
me. Naturally the Plan could not 
divert resources for my sake ... so 
... I was declared surplus. Oh, I 
won’t deny it disturbed me a little, 
at first. But I came to accept it. 
And you will too, Steve. You see, 
you have no other choice.” 

XII 

A ccept the fate he would not, 
though he was powerfully 
tempted. A rain shower in the mid- 
dle of the night woke him and he 
ran out, careless that he woke his 
cabin mates and left them staring, 
to find a standpipe under the eaves 
and drink, drink, drink. It gave him 
the strength he needed. The next 
morning he could see a difference. 
He held out his hand before him and 
it shook. It shook! He was nervous. 
He was also very hungry. 

Water was not, for the moment, 
a problem. He had found a jug that 
would do and carefully filled it from 
the drain of a dozen roofs. It tasted 
of zinc and tar. But he was off the 
drug. 

And hungry. 

Pie did not dare to eat in the 
commissary. 

Oporto came to see him at break- 
fast and that little dark face missed 
nothing. “Not hungry, Steve?” 

Ryeland pushed aside his un- 
touched plate — ham hash! lovely, 
irresistible coffee! — and said, “No. 
I’m not hungry.” Later, in the hut 
of the Dixie Presidents, Oporto still 
tagging along, the little man pointed 



94 



IF 




at the jug of rain water. “What’s 
that?” 

“It’s water. In case I get thirsty,” 
said Ryeland, allowing himself a 
small drink. 

Oporto’s face remained thought- 
ful. 

Ryeland found a sense of doom 
pressing in on him, a fear that dried 
his mouth and bothered his digestion 
— damaged already by the curious 
nature of the few substances he 
dared eat. He enjoyed it. He wel- 
comed the flutterings of terror be- 
tween his shoulderblades. He looked 
around him at the other cadavers 
of Heaven, and they were zombies, 
dead-alive, the victims of asphodel. 
They laughed and smiled and walk- 
ed about (when they had what was 
needful to walk with), but they 
were dead men. Not Ryeland. He 
was alive, and in a panic. And very 
hungry. 

He managed to shake Oporto just 
before the second shape-up, and 
seized time to study some of the 
entries in the journal: 

Oct. 16. The only examination 
given to the discarded parts in 
the trash pile is visual. They are 
under the observation of a 
guard stationed on the watch 
balcony of the North Clinic. 
Sometimes he isn’t there, but I 
do not know v/hy. 

Nov. 5. Today I was in the 
North Clinic on the fifth floor, 
where the guard is stationed. 

I found out why he is sometimes 
absent, I think. Twice he was 
called in to help move patients; 
apparently this is part of his 
job. Since I was strapped to the 



table with a spinal tap I couldn’t 
watch closely, but it seems evi- 
dent that each time he is called 
inside he will remain there for 
at least half a minute, and that 
the periods at which he is most 
likely to be called are those 
when the operation schedule is 
heavy. Probably the three hours 
or so following each shape-up 
would be the best time. The 
morning and lunch shape-ups 
are no good. First, I would not 
be able to conceal my absence 
for more than a couple of hours; 
second, they don’t usually dump 
the scraps until night anyway. 
That leaves only the night. Un- 
fortunately not much operat- 
ing is done then . Today it 
was the left leg, including the 
femur. 

Dec. 3. Unusually heavy call- 
outs at the shape-up this morn- 
ing. The rumor is that there was 
a nuclear explosion in Baja Cal- 
ifornia and a great many spare 
parts will be needed. I wonder. 
Tonight? 

Ryeland turned the page, hut he 
already knew what he would find. 

The next entry was the last. It 
had been close for D.W.H., but not 
quite close enough. 

H unger was beginning to prey 
on him seriously. His system 
began to refuse the sugar. 

Operto was openly suspicious 
now. He walked with Ryeland all 
over Heaven. Down by the palm- 
fringed lake he sat with his back 
against a boulder and watched Rye- 
land grimly hurling rocks at the 
hanging coconuts. Ryeland did not 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 



95 




succeed in knocking one down, but 
he did, after visiting a few clumps of 
palms, find one that had fallen. 
guess you like coconut milk a lot,” 
Oporto said sulkily, seeing how 
greedily Ryeland hammered off the 
outer husk and bashed in the shell. 

“I love it.” Actually the nut was 
overripe, and the milk had a foul 
taste. 

“Tastes good with garlic, huh?” 
Oporto was referring to some wild 
roots Ryeland had found, dark 
green spears thrusting out of the 
grass with a cluster of muddy little 
strong-favored knobs underground; 
Oporto had found him nibbling 
them experimentally. 

Ryeland said: “Leave me alone, 
will you? I — ah — don’t feel very 
well,” 

Oporto sighed. “Fm not sur- 
prised.” But he wandered away after 
a while. 

Ryeland dismissed him from his 
mind. He felt weak and starved. 
It was only psychological, he told 
himself; why, shipwrecked mariners 
had lasted for months and years on 
little more than what he had so 
easily come by! 

But they had not, it was true, 
been subjected to the thrice-daily 
temptation of a loaded table from 
which they dared not eat. 

And there was another considera- 
tion. He looked longingly at the 
little fish in the lake, for example. 
He could easily catch one. What 
was to stop him from broiling it 
over a fire? 

But he had already attracted 
enough attention, he dared no more. 
Surely the guardians of Heaven 
96 



would know what to do with a 
cadaver who had stumbled on the 
necessity of avoiding their drugs. 
Once they found one such it would 
be only a name on the shape-up 
list, a needle in the arm, and all 
the drug his system could absorb 
thrust into him at one moment. Will 
power would not help him then. 

Yet he could not avoid suspicion 
entirely, not as long as he con- 
tinued to reject the all but irresist- 
able food of Heaven. Already he 
was concerned over his mates in the 
Dixie Presidents, not to mention 
Angela Zwick and, above all, Opor- 
to, whose behavior was no longer 
suspicious but sure. There was no 
doubt; Oporto knew. 

T he next morning he got away 
. from the others and scouted 
the periphery of Heaven. Reluctant- 
ly he decided that what everyone 
said was true; the fence was im- 
passable. It would have to be the 
garbage heap. 

The leftover bits from the ca- 
davers in Heaven were deposited in 
a stainless steel sump next the North 
Clinic. The pit was empty at this 
hour; it had been sluiced clean, its 
tons of abandoned humanity chuted 
into a barge and towed away. The 
hot sun had baked it gleaming. It 
was surrounded by a wire fence, and 
that in turn screened by red-flower- 
ed bougainvillea bushes. Ryeland 
wondered if the fence were elec- 
trified. Probably not. 

It would, he thought, be wise to 
make his bid for freedom soon. The 
quicker he tried, the more likely that 
he would retain all his parts. Even 

IF 




now, he saw, there was some sort of 
activity going on; guards were on 
the roof of the North Clinic, work- 
ing around what looked like search- 
light projectors. Ryeland scowled. 
If they flooded the garbage heap 
with light, that would make things 
more difficult. Still, the projectors 
were peculiar; they had reflectors 
but no lenses, and they seemed to 
be rather small for the task involved. 
Ryeland crossed his fingers. Per- 
haps they would be for some other 
use entirely. He could only hope. 

‘‘Sdeve! Sdeve Ryeland!” a famil- 
iar voice called loudly. It was Opor- 
to — shouting, waving, smiling. 

Ryeland waited, suddenly wary. 
How had the little man known he 
would be here? And what was this 
sudden excitement in his manner? 
Oporto was sniffling, almost quiver- 
ing. “Whad a mess, hey, Steve? You 
hear about id?” 

‘‘About what?” 

“Another tube collabze! Eighdeen 
hundred people this time. You know 
whad I think? Sabodage. Thad’s 
whad I think.” 

Ryeland shook his head. He was 
not feeling over-friendly to the little 
man; he was still wary. Still, there 
was the chance that Oporto knew 
something, even here, cut off from 
the world as they all were. “Sabotage 
by whom?” 

“Anti-Plan elemends,” Oporto ex- 
plained cheerfully. “They’ve been 
happeding all over the world, you 
know. Thousands dead! Commudi- 
cation wrecked!” He glanced over 
his shoulder, smiled, and said quite 
loudly: “Or don’d you think so, 
Steven Ryeland?” 



Ryeland’s nostrils flared; he 
smelled danger. He looked where 
Oporto had glanced, and saw what 
Oporto had seen. Three big men in 
the white uniforms, coming toward 
them with purpose. He understood 
why Oporto had spoken his name 
so loudly; and the little man nodded, 
quite unabashed. “Yes, Steve. Judas 
Isgariot, thad’s my other name.” 

T he guards looked as though 
they were spoiling for a touch 
of resistance from him. He didn’t 
offer it. He let them take him to 
the clinic, and when the needle was 
presented to his arm he stared at it 
without emotion. The shot was pain- 
less enough, even though he knew 
what it was. It was asphodel again, 
but this time he was ready for it 
“Don’t give us any more trouble, 
Zero-Dome,” growled the guard, 
and released him at the gate of the 
clinic. 

Ryeland’s body responded at once 
to the shot. He accepted it; it was 
warmly comforting; it would not 
matter now. He almost laughed out 
loud. He could not feel betrayed by 
Oporto, even; Oporto could no long- 
er commit betrayal; he was no long- 
er trusted. And meanwhile . Rye- 
land could eat! 

There was a guard brooding over 
the tables assigned to the Dixie Presi- 
dents at lunch. Ryeland conscien- 
tiously gorged himself on roast 
pork and sweet potatoes, with three 
cups of coffee. It tasted very good. 
Why not? It didn’t matter any more. 
Meprobamate is not a narcotic; it 
doesn’t keep you from thinking. It 
only eases jitters — that sovereign

incentive to action! — and for Rye- 
land the vv^orrying fear had already 
served its purpose. He had his plan. 
He would carry it out that night, if 
he could; the next night certainly. 
He recognized quite calmly that, 
now that Oporto had told the 
guards he was avoiding food, he 
would no longer serve any purpose 
by not eating; they would pick him 
up and inject him. All right. It didn’t 
matter, nothing mattered, he was 
on his way out. 

He could hardly wait for sun- 
down and escape. 

It was time, too. There were 
heavy callouts that day. Ryeland’s 
bunkmate had gone at breakfast 
and had not returned by lunch — 
wouldn’t ever return, now, said the 
wise old heads; if you didn’t come 
back by the next shape-up, you 
weren’t coming back at all. Five 
names were called at noon. At din- 
ner, seven more — why, thought 
Ryeland through his comfortable 
haze of meprobamate, that left only 
three in the entire cottage who had 
not been called for some donation 
that day, and Ryeland was one of 
them. Clearly he was pushing his 
luck. 

After the evening shape-up he 
looked one last time around Heaven 
and strolled away. Just in time. 

For as he was almost out of ear- 
shot in the gathering dark, a white- 
clad guard came down the shell path. 
Ryeland paused, listening. “Rye- 
land,” the guard was saying, and 
something with the word “clinic.” 

Rumble-rumble; the bass voice of 
one of the few survivors of the 
Dixie Presidents, answering. 



“Oh.” The guard again, not very 
interested. “Well, when he turns up, 
tell him to report. She can wait.” 
Ryeland hid himself in the night 
What they wanted with him he 
could not know; but he was very 
sure that his time was even shorter 
than he had thought. But who was 
the “she” who could wait? Angela? 

He could hardly think so, but — 
well, why not go to see her? If it 
turned out to be Angela, who had 
somehow inveigled a guard into be- 
ing messenger-boy for her, there was 
no reason he should not find out 
why. If it turned out not to be her 
... he was surely all the better off 
for being as far as possible from the 
cabin of the Dixie Presidents. 

I t wasn’t Angela. She was com- 
pletely ignorant of why the 
guard had been looking for him, 
and completely disinterested. 

Uneasily, keeping an alert eye 
open for any possible guard who 
might come their way, he sat down 
beside her in the warm tropical eve- 
ning. More to see what she would 
say than to relieve his feelings, he 
told her about Oporto’s reporting 
him to the guards and his conse- 
quent new dose of tranquilizer. 
“Very right of him, Steve. You 
shouldn’t go against the Plan!” 

He shook his head ruefully. 
can’t understand you,” he admitted. 
“To work for the Plan — yes. That’s 
duty. But to betray a friend — ” He 
stopped, and looked quickly at her, 
but she only laughed. 

“I know, Steven. But you’re 
wrong. Do you remember what I 
was doing when we first met?” 



98 



IF 




‘‘Running a computer.” 

“That’s right! And we would set 
up problems — oh, enormous prob- 
lems. I loved that job, Steven! And 
the computer would solve them, one- 
two, click-click, ting-a-ling! It could 
do it without fail; well, it was part 
of the Plan, you see. Only one unit 
in the master Plan of Man that the 
Machine itself runs. Do you know 
why it was never wrong?” 

“You tell me,” he growled. She 
was so calm! 

“Because we tested it!” she cried. 
“There was a special test-circuit 
switch. After a big problem we’d 
send a charge — oh, five times 
normal voltage! — through every 
last tube and transistor and relay. 
If anything was going to fail, it 
would fail then — and we’d know 
— and we could replace it. And . 
well, Steven,” she said, quite serious, 
“that’s what I am, you see. I’m a 
test charge.” 

She leaned forward against the 
high restraining chair-^rms that kept 
her limbless body from toppling, 
“You can’t be allowed to fail the 
Plan!” she cried. “You must be 
found if you are weak . and re- 
placed. Oporto and I, we have one 
purpose under the Plan of Man: to 
find and report the bad tubes. Did 
I trick you? I don’t know; is the 
excess voltage flushing out a com- 
puter a ‘trick?’ You were a bad tube. 
Admit it, Steven; you could fail. 
You did fail! And the Machine is 
better without you!” 

Ryeland paced about. The girl 
watched him solemnly, her eyes 
large and compassionate. He said 
at last, unwillingly: “And you are 



willing to serve the Machine, even 
after it lops your arms and legs off?^ 
“I’m willing.” 

“Then you’re crazier than Opor« 
to!” he roared. “The Machine is a 
monster! The Plan of Man is a 
hoax!” 

She refused to be shocked. 
keeps thirteen billion of us alive,” sha 
reminded him. 

“It keeps thirteen billion of na 
enslaved!” 

“Do you have another way!” 

He scowled. “I don’t know. May- 
be — out in the Reefs of Space — ” 
“The Reefs of Space are no long- 
er of any importance to you, my 
dear. Just like Ron Donderevo. Oh, 
he was a real man — and mayba 
there are Reefs, I don’t know. But 
there’s nothing there for us.” She 
moved her head, and the obedient 
wheels brought her closer to him. 
“And is it so bad, Steven? Being 
slaves? I know you have ideals — 
I respect you for them, truly I do! 
But this is a matter of life and death 
for Mankind. And isn’t it true that, 
for almost all of us, under the Plan 
of Man there is happiness?” 

He laughed shortly. “It comes hi 
the drinking water!” 

“All of it?” She leaned back lazily, 
looking at him with candid hug« 
eyes. “What about me, Steven. 
Don’t you want me?” 

It caught him off-guard. He 
flushed. “I — I don’t know what — " 
“Because I’m here, Steven,” she 
went on softly. “If you wanted me. 
I’m here. And I’m helpless; I can’t 
resist you.” 

He swallowed. “You — Yoa 
could scream for help. The guards

would — Damn your He leaped 
away from her. “I’ll never forgive 
you that, Angela! You’ve dragged 
me down to your level, haven’t you? 
But you can’t do the same trick 
again!” 

She said, calm, real regret in her 
voice, “I don’t know what you mean, 
dear.” And after a moment Ryeland 
realized that there was truth in 
what she said. She meant it; she 
was his to take, if he chose, and 
she would not have blamed him. 
He said brutally: 

“You’re a high-voltage test cir- 
cuit, Angela, yes, indeed! But you’ve 
already burned me once. I don’t 
intend for it to happen again!” 
There was no longer any doubt 
of what he had to do in his mind. 
He was inside a wall; well, a wall 
had two sides. He would reach that 
other side! Perhaps he would be 
alive; more likely he would be a 
cadaver, stripped of useful parts. 
But he would reach it. 

Because . because, he thought, 
on the other side of that wall were 
many things. There was freedom — 
maybe — in the Reefs of Space. 
There was, perhaps, the man who 
knew how to remove collars. 

And there was Donna Creery. 

A bruptly he turned to Angela 
again, surprised at his own 
thought of the Planner’s daughter, 
unwilling to think farther in that 
most dangerous of directions. He 
said, “I — I didn’t mean — ” 
“Don’t apologize, Steve. You of 
all people — ” 

He became conscious that she 
bad stopped in the middle of a 

100 



thought. “What were you going to 
say?” 

“Oh . Nothing. Nothing much. 
Just that. .” 

“Angela!” he said angrily. “You’ve 
always kept secrets from me! Please 
don’t keep on with it — not here! 
Now, what were you going to say? 
Something about me ‘of all people’? 
Am I any different from other 
people?” 

Her wide, lovely eyes studied him 
serenely .Then she said: “Don’t you 
know that you are?” 

Her cool regard made him un- 
comfortable. He had to gulp before 
he could ask what she meant. 

“Haven’t you been aware of any- 
thing strange about yourself?” 

He was about to shake his head, 
when something froze him. He re- 
called the riddle of the three days 
he had lost. Suddenly he remem- 
bered a ^ime when he thought he 
had heard her voice, from the dark 
outside the circle of pitiless light 
that blazed down on the therapy 
couch, before she had sacrificed 
her limbs to the Plan. 

“You must have noticed that you 
are different, Steve,” her soft voice 
taunted him. “Have you ever won- 
dered why?” 

For a moment he wanted to strike 
her. The iron collar was suddenly 
tighter around his neck, so tight 
that he could scarcely breathe, so 
tight that he felt the veins throbbing 
at his throat. He sat numb and sil- 
ent, staring at her. 

“Did you think you were human?” 
Her voice was contemptuous, merci- 
less. “I thought you might guess, 
when I was telling you how Don- 

IF 





derevo got away. You are the junk 
man.” 

“Junk — what?” 

The hair stood up at the nape 
of his neck. He shuddered in the 
sun. The collar was heavier than 
lead, colder than ice. 

“I told you that a thing waa 
patched together out of waste parts. 
A decoy for the guards to watefa 
while Donderevo got away. Well, 
Steve, that’s what you are.” 

He sat still, breathing carefully 
through the cruel constriction of the 
collar. 

“If you’re good-looking, Steve, 
that’s because the surgeons were 
trying to put together a reasonable 
likeness of Ron Donderevo, who 
was a handsome man. If you dislike 
the Plan, it is because your brain 
and your glands were patched to- 
gether from what was left of sev- 
eral of its most distinguished ene- 
mies. If you have an unusual mas- 
tery of helical field theory, it is be- 
cause one lobe of your brain be- 
longed to the man who invented it. 
If the rest of your memory is some- 
what blurred or contradictory, it 
is because the rest of your brain waa 
stuck together from odds and ends 
of tissue.” 

“No!” he whispered hoarsely. 
•^That can’t be true — ” 

But the collar choked off hia 
voice. He felt weak and numb with 
a hideous feeling that it could be 
true. “If I was ever here before,” 
he argued desperately, “I can’t re- 
member anything about it.” 

•*That goes to prove it.” Angela’s 
slow smile was innocently sweet. 
“The men who assembled you were 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 



101 




research scientists, as well as ene- 
mies of the Plan. They had been 
using bits of waste brain tissue in 
efforts to improve upon nature. 
When they were putting your brain 
together, they seized the opportu- 
nity to create a mental mechanism 
dangerous to the plan.” 

Dazed, he could only shake his 
head. 

‘^There’s proof enough, if you 
don’t believe me,” she said. ^Xook 
at all your feats of sabotage. The 
subtrain tubes and fusion reactions 
and ion-drive accelerators that you 
have demolished with your f/n- 
proved designs — ” 

Agony wrenched him. 

don’t remember — ” 

“That’s the final perfection of 
your mental mechanism,” she said 
calmly. “The disloyal surgeons 
equipped your new brain with a 
self-erasing circuit, to protect you 
from any temptation to reveal your 
secrets under torture. Aren’t you 
aware of the blank in your past?” 
“I — I am,” Shuddering, he 
nodded. 

“That’s all you are.” A lazy malice 
glinted in her smile. “All the special 
attention that you have been re- 
ceiving for the past three years is 
proof that you functioned remark- 
ably well as a sabotage device, but 
your function has been performed. 
I suppose you are setting some sort 
of precedent, now that all your or- 
gans are about to be salvaged for 
the second time. But in spite of 
that, Steve, I can’t help feeling that 
you are trying to carry your head 
a little too high. Actually, you’re 
nothing more than a hundred and 



sixty pounds of bait that those 
traitors filched from the sharks.” 

XIII 

S hark meat! If that was all 
he was, then this was the 
place for him! 

Ryeland lurked in a clump of the 
bougainvilleas near the garbage pit, 
watching the guards on the roof, 
while the sun went down and the 
sky purpled and the stars began to 
find pockets in the cloud cover 
through which they could appear. 

The searchlights — or whatever 
— were not turned on. 

Numbed, Ryeland watched and 
tried not to think. That was one 
less worry. Still, there were guards 
on the roof; he would have to wait 
until it was darker. The guards were 
idly looking out over Heaven to the 
sea. It was a warm night, a fine 
tropic night. 

But what was before him was an 
ugly spectacle. 

It was odd, Ryeland thought 
dreamily, that the Plan of Man per- 
mitted itself this touch of natural 
human horror. The world was so 
cuddled in cotton batting, so in- 
sulated against shock, that it would 
seem this sight should have been 
hidden away. Before him lay some 
tons of meat and bone — ampu- 
tated, exsanguinated, raped of cor- 
neal tissue and bone grafts, of 
healthy arterial sections and snips 
of nervous tissue. 

What had been taken from the 
pale cold cadavers behind the fence 
was that mere nothing, life. What 
remained was good organic matter. 




And that was another queer thing, 
thought Ryeland. It would have 
been a superb animal feed! Or, if 
on this one point the Plan of Man 
had reason to be tender, why, how 
many thousands of acres of mined- 
out farmland could be rejuvenated 
with the protein and phosphate In 
those corpses? 

The Plan did not choose to use 
them in that way. Each night the 
accumulated parts were chuted to 
a barge — the barge towed out to 
sea — the contents given the deep 
six. Fish, crabs, drifting jellies and 
moored bivalves would ingest their 
flesh. Why? Men would eat the fish; 
why not shorten the chain? 

Ryeland shifted uneasily, and 
turned his thought, away — for, if 
Angela told the truth, from this sort 
of rubble his own body had been 
built. Anyway, it was almost time. 

There was a murmur of public- 
address speakers from the cottage 
areas. He couldn’t hear the words, 
but it was unusual for them to be 
used at all so late at night. Then 
another cluster of speakers spoke 
up — nearer, this time. It sounded 
as though a name were being called. 

Ryeland swore under his breath. 
The sentry nearest him stood rigid 
as the Machine itself, gazing out 
over Heaven. Couldn’t he at least 
take a break, stretch, yawn, gaze 
at the stars — couldn’t he do any- 
thing but remain alert and watchful 
at his post? 

The loudspeakers again. It was 
the circuit around the lake, Ryeland 
guessed. And the tone was becom- 
ing irritable, as though the guard 
in his microphone room atop the 



Clinic was being annoyed by higher 
authority . and was passing hii 
annoyance on to the cadavers of 
Heaven. 

Then closer still; and Ryeland 
heard the name this time. His own 
name. ‘"Ryeland!” Only it came 
bouncing off half a dozen speaker! 
at once, each delayed a tiny fraction 
of a second by distance and echo: 
“RYELANDRye/ant/ryeland,” rico^ 
cheting away. 

He was not surprised; he had been 
more than half expecting it. He lis- 
tened to the measured words, ca- 
denced to let the echo of each fade 
before the next word was spoken: 
“You . are . ordered ... to ... 
report . to . the . South . 
Clinic ... at ... once!” And off to- 
ward the lake Ryeland could see 
lights moving. 

Ryeland took a deep breath. He 
would have to chance it, even if the 
guard did not look away — 

He caught himself, poised. The 
guard moved. He turned his head 
and nodded, to someone out of 
sight; and then, so quickly that Rye- 
land might scarcely have noticed 
he was gone if his eyes had not been 
glued to the man, the guard stepped 
inside. 

Ryeland ran, climbed, swung him 
self over the fence, ripped off his 
clothes, balled and hid them under 
a body and flung himself, naked and 
acrawl with revulsion, onto the heap 
of pale, cold corpses. 

T here was classic terror. It wm 
like the buried-alive man of 
humanity’s oldest, most frightening 
story: the awakening in the narrow

box, the dark, the smell of damp 
earth, the hollow muffled sound of 
the hammered coffin lid with six 
feet of graveyard dirt above. It uas 
like the war wounded given up for 
dead, awakening in one of Grant’s 
wagons after Shiloh, or the mass 
graves of Hiker’s Sixth Army out- 
side Stalingrad — the dead all 
around, the man himself as good as 
dead. 

Ryeland thanked God for mepro- 
bamate. He lay face down and limbs 
under him, as much as he could. 
No reason to make a guard wonder 
why a relatively intact corpse should 
be on the heap. He did not move. 
He smelled an acrid, sour reek that 
nearly made him vomit and he was, 
in a moment, bitter cold. He swore 
silently. It had not occurred to him 
that the metal walls of the trashbin 
would be refrigerated. 

He waited. And waited. 

He dared not look up, dared hard- 
ly breathe. It would be, he calcu- 
lated, at least a matter of hours be- 
fore the bin would tip and chute its 
contents into the barge. His flesh 
crawled and tried desperately to 
shiver, but he would not allow it. 

A bright light flared. 

Ryeland froze. He heard a mur- 
mur of voices. But that was all 
right; it probably was time for 
changing the shift of guards, and that 
was good, because it meant time was 
passing even faster than he had 
dared hope. The light would be only 
a routine inspection, of course. 
Another light flared, and another. 

The area of corpses was flooded 



with light, he was drowning in light; 
over him he could hear the wash 
of copter vanes adding their light 
to the scene. He dared not move. 
He dared not even blink, though 
the lights were cruel; but it was in 
vain; everything was in vain. There 
was a sudden string of orders and a 
commotion at the steel ladder that 
admitted workmen to the sump. 
Four guards ran in. They did not 
hesitate; they picked their way rap- 
idly across the stainless-steel floor, 
stepping on torsos, pushing limbs 
aside. Straight to Ryeland. 

‘‘Good try,” one of them grinned. 
Then, without humor, “But don’t do 
it again.” 

They hurried him to the ladder 
and up it. They had not allowed him 
to retrieve his clothes. Now that it 
was too late his body was racked 
with shivering. He si.tmmcred, “How 
— how did you know?” 

The guard caught his elbow and 
lifted him to the roof of the North 
Clinic. He was not unkind. He ges- 
tured to the row of searchlight-like 
things that Ryeland had feared 
might be floodlights. “Infrared scan- 
ners, Ryeland. Sniffed out your 
body heat. Oh, you can fool them — 
but not while you’re alive, not with- 
out clothes on to hide your heat. 
And clothes would have given you 
away anyhow,” he added compas- 
sionately, “so don’t feel bad. You 
just didn’t have a chance.” He open- 
ed a door and shoved Ryeland, reel- 
ing, into a hall of the Clinic. “Now 
get a move on. Somebody wants 
you. Somebody important.”

They made one little mistake — 
very natural — and disastrous! 



T he male silth plodded for- 
ward wearily at sixty miles an 
hour, pausing only long enough to 
uproot and wolf down one of the 
rare scrub trees directly in its path. 
Its three hundred tons of massive 
body shook the ground as the great 
hind legs thumped along, and every 
cell of it ached with hunger. It was 
warm blooded, despite its vaguely 
reptilian appearance. Only meat 
could satisfy its need for energy. 
But the great herds lay a thousand 



miles to the north of this barren 
land. 

Inside the silth, the two-pound 
network of converted nerve cells 
that was Arnek brooded darkly in 
self-pity and resentment against the 
inflexible female logic of his mate. 
Ptarra had won her point, as she 
always did; now she might at least 
have shown some consideration for 
him and his silth! 

“Amek!” The call came sharply 
on one of the guard frequencies of

the mental spectrum. “Arnek, stop 
lagging and get up herel” 

He could feel his nerve body tense 
from horn tip to tail root, but he 
stifled his response and quickened 
his pace. Ahead, the trail left by 
Ptarra’s legs led through a gully 
and up a rise to the lip of a small, 
stony basin. The four hundred tons 
of Ptarra’s female silth squatted be- 
low the edge and the great head 
was half hidden as it peered down- 
ward around a boulder, 

“Quiet!” Ptarra ordered sharply. 
Then, as Arnek switched from a 
thudding run to a smooth, creeping 
approach, the mental impulse took 
on a note of triumph. “Look down 
there and then teU me I don’t know 
a ship trail from a meteor!” 

The bowl was bright in the glare 
of the orange sunlight, but at first 
Arnek saw nothing. Then, as his 
gaze swept back toward the nearer 
section, he blinked his great eyes, 
only half believing what they regis- 
tered. 

It was a small thing, hardly taller 
than Arnck’s silth — maybe not 
even as tall. But it was too regular 
and obviously artificial, a pointed 
cylinder, to be a meteorite. Be- 
tween two of the base fins there 
seemed to be an opening, with a 
miniature ramp leading down to 
the ground. It looked like a deli- 
cately precise model of a spaceship 
from the dawn of time. 

It was obviously too small to be 
more than a message carrier. Yet, 
as he looked more closely, he could 
see motion. Two tiny creatures, not 
more than six feet in height, were 
scurrying around near the base. 



Bright patches of fur or decoration 
covered them, and they seemed to 
move on two of their four limbs. 

A rnek shivered down the length 
of his nerves with an ancient 
distaste for crawling things. “Let’s 
go back,” he suggested uneasily. 
“There’s nothing here for us, and 
I’m hungry.” 

“Don’t be silly,” Ptarra answered, 
and the old female superiority was 
strong in the thought. “Of course 
it’s too small for us; I knew that 
when I saw the landing trail yester- 
day evening. It must be an instru- 
ment probe, with test animals. If 
it has telemetering equipment, 
though — ” 

Arnek tested the three spectra 
uneasily. At this distance, even a 
tight beam should be detectable. 
But he could feel nothing. There 
was only the steady wash of inertia- 
gravitic wavules, the electromagne- 
tic noise from the sun and the grow- 
ing, contemptuous mental leakage 
from Ptarra. Then he squirmed in 
embarrassment as his eyes detected 
the cracked base of the little ship. 

Obviously, it had landed hard — 
probably hard enough to ruin in- 
struments and release the two crea- 
tures. He should have noticed that 
at once. 

There was no time to admit his 
error, however. Ptarra’s silth lunged 
upright and the great rear legs be- 
gan pulping ground and rocks in a 
full charge. Arnek leaped to follow 
out of old hunting habit. On a down- 
grade, his lighter silth soon caught 
up with the other. 

Below, the two humans swung 

IF 



106 




around at the earth-shaking thunder 
of the charge and started a frantic 
scrambling. They were making shrill 
sounds now, and the extreme low 
band of the mental spectrum held 
faint impulses. 

Ptarra’s thoughts lashed against 
his nerves. “Cut them off! Don’t let 
them back to the probe. They may 
have destruct conditioning.” 

In the hunt, Amck had long since 
become only an extension of his 
dominant mate. Now he folded his 
forelegs and dropped his head and 
neck into a javelin aimed between 
humans and ships. The smaller of 
the two was almost at the ramp. 

At the last moment, moved by 
a sudden impulse, Arnek dropped 
his head lower and retracted his 
neck to soften the blow. He felt the 
human midge strike against his 
snout and go caromming off, to 
land fifty feet away. 

Dim pain impulses stirred in the 
low mental background. Anger — 
or something like it — came from 
the other creature. 

Arnek braked and pivoted sharp- 
ly. The larger human had run for- 
ward toward the bloodied smaller 
figure. But as the silth’s head faced 
the creature, one of the human’s 
arms darted to something strapped 
about its middle. There was a sur- 
prising blast of sound. A stream of 
tiny, exploding pellets struck against 
Arnek’s snout. He bellowed in an- 
noyance and took a step forward, 
lifting a foreleg to swat at the 
midge. 

It jerked back. Then it darted 
forward, bending to lift its com- 
panion in its forelimbs. Either the 



gravity here was less than on its 
home world, or the thing was 
stronger than it looked. The first 
leap sent the burdened human back- 
wards more than twenty feet. Then 
it was bounding off in frantic efforts 
to reach the further side of the de- 
pression where a jumble of rocks 
might give it cover. 

There was amusement in Ptarra’s 
thoughts. “If your hunger is so great, 
why didn’t you eat them? They 
aren’t much, of course, but the 
blood smells sweet enough.” 

Arnek sighed along his nerves, 
unable to answer. 

Let Ptarra put it down to an- 
other male whim if she liked, but 
he hadn’t thought of eating them 
before. There had been something 
cute and pathetic about them. They 
reminded him of the little gulla he 
had owned in his youth, in a long- 
lost, ruined universe. 

“It had a weapon,” he comment- 
ed, changing the subject. 

Ptarra rumbled an assent. “I no- 
ticed. Interesting conditioning. The 
probe builders must have superb 
nerve development to do that to 
the lower orders. They’ll make good 
silths. Now let’s see what we can 
find in the probe.” 

S he slipped a claw into the 
base opening and began work- 
ing it upwards as delicately as the 
clumsy foreleg would permit. 

Arnek moved forward to help, 
but she waved him back impatient- 
ly, and he waited meekly until she 
finished. She was right, of course. 
As a male, he had no training with 
mechanisms. He would only have 

IF 



108 




mined whatever lay inside. It was 
a marvelously delicate set of ma- 
chinery . thought the theory be- 
hind the engineering seemed rather 
elementary. 

Arnek studied what he could of it, 
growing more puzzled. “Maybe the 
creatures operated it,” he suggested. 

“What makes you think so?” 

“1 don’t know. It just seems some- 
how — ” 

“Intuition!” Ptarra snorted. Then 
she seemed less certain. “Yet I can’t 
blame you this time. It does almost 
look that way. But it’s logically im- 
possible. Besides, there are auto- 
matic controls for guiding the 
probe. The builders probably just 
amused themselves, the way we 
once put slurry-pods in the gulla 
pens. Ah, this looks sound enough!” 

She pulled a tiny box out of the 
wreckage that had been spread out 
flat on the ground. 

With infinite care, she managed 
to hook one claw over a miniature 
control. Almost immediately, radio 
waves began forming a recurrent 
pattern along their nerves, coming 
in long and short pulses. 

Half an hour later, there was an- 
other faint quiver of radio waves 
from space, this time completely 
modulated. Even Arnek could real- 
ize that it was on the same fre- 
quency, but dopplered to indicate 
something approaching their world. 
He stopped browsing for the few 
stunted trees and came back to join 
his mate. 

Night was just falling. Ptarra led 
them back toward the rock ledge 
from which they had first spied the 
probe. There was a large fissure in 



the rocks into which they could just 
squeeze, and which would hide them 
from the sight of any landing craft. 

A moon came up, and they could 
see the depression clearly in its light. 
Now Arnek saw the larger human 
slipping across the ground toward 
the wreck of the probe. It darted 
about frantically, but with an ap- 
pearance of purpose. A few mo- 
ments later, it was retreating, carry- 
ing a load of packages with it. 

“It seems almost intelligent,” he 
said softly. 

He strained to follow the faint 
wash of impressions on the lower 
band. There was something there 
that struck a familiar chord in his 
thoughts, but he could not decode 
it. 

“Just instinct,” Ptarra dismis.sed it 
with cool logic. “A female seeking 
food for its injured mate.” 

Arnek sighed uncomfortably. “It 
doesn’t seem female,” he objected. 

“Another hunch? Don’t be silly, 
Arnek. It has to be a female. The 
larger, stronger and more intelligent 
form is always female. How else 
could it care for the young? It needs 
ability for a whole family, while the 
male needs only enough for him- 
self. The laws of evolution are logi- 
cal or we wouldn’t have evolved 
at all.” 

There was no answer to such 
logic, other than the vague discon- 
tent Arnek felt. And he knew that 
was only because of his envy of the 
greater ability of the other sex. He 
settled back, ruminating hungrily 
and listening to the signal from 
space. 

The little box from the wreck 



THE COURSE OF LOGIC 



109 




was silent now, but the other signals 
were stronger. 

Ptarra nodded. ^'They’re coming. 
After four hundred years, we have 
a chance. New silths to breed. A 
chance to reproduce ourselves and 
multiply. A new universe for our 
own,” There was immense satisfac- 
tion with self in her thoughts. ‘‘Well, 
I earned it!” 

A rnek could not deny it. It 
had been more than four hun- 
dred years in this galaxy. Eight 
thousand of them had set out, leav- 
ing behind a small, ancient universe 
being wrecked by the horror of an 
exploding supernova. They had been 
driven out from the planetary con- 
quests of a billion years and had 
sought refuge across intergalactic 
space to this universe. 

A hundred of the marvelously 
adapted silths of their universe had 
survived the eons of suspended ani- 
mation to preserve their occupants. 
And then had come the hunt for 
new silth forms, since the trip had 
aged the others beyond the power 
of reproduction, in spite of all their 
precautions. 

Finding a silth form was never 
easy. There had been only three 
animals that had served in their en- 
tire old galaxy. Only a creature 
with several pounds of nerve tissues 
could hold the nuclear proteins of 
the sentient annas. And that re- 
quired huge creatures, since nerve 
tissue was always so thinly scattered 
in normal flesh. 

They had toured a quadrant of 
the new galaxy, studying planet af- 
ter planet, before they found this 

110 



world. Here the great beasts were 
barely sufficiently endowed with 
nerve fiber. Eight annas had sur- 
vived this far. Six failed to stand 
the shock of entry and regrowth in 
the new silth forms. Now there was 
only the one pair — Arnek and 

Ptarra, 

Left to himself, Arnek would 
have perished long ago. Their hope 
of retraining the clumsy forelegs of 
the silth forms had proved futile, 
and the nerve capacity was too low 
for them to exercise their full fac- 
ulties. The converted nuclei of the 
cells was never quite efficient, either. 
And there seemed no hope 
of ever reproducing their own. Cer- 
tainly no newly budded anna could 
survive the metamorphosis into these 
awkward bodies; that had been al- 
most impossible for mature powers. 
Nor could a young anna survive 
long without a silth. 

Four iiundred years! And now — 
now, he thought, he was tired. It 
no longer mattered. His home lay 
in ruins eons away. Let Ptarra 
worry about it. He twisted his neck 
back to put his snout under his tail 
and tried to sleep, while hunger 
rumbled noisily in his stomach. 

The sun was glaring down again 
when he awoke to the nudging of 
Ptarra’s snout, and there was a 
roaring in the air above. Something 
rushed downwards, bellowing out 
thrust against gravity. It was an- 
other ship, landing over the wreck- 
age of the first. 

But it was no monster such as 
might have carried new and better 
silth forms. It was hardly larger 
than the first, though it somehow 

IF 




seemed to be better made. It landed 
smoothly and squatted on the 
ground, sending out signals. 

“Another probe,” Ptarra said. 
There was disappointment in her 
thoughts, quickly masked by cold 
logic. “Naturally, they’d wait to 
check with something like this. 
There will probably be several 
probes before they decide they have 
to investigate personally. All rightl 
We’ll give them something to worry 
about.” 

She was lunging to her feet, just 
as an opening appeared in the ship. 
This time something ran out, down 
the ramp — a tiny gadget of churn- 
ing tracks and metal carapace, 
chuffing out shrill little motor 
sounds. It circled briefly and then 
headed across the bowl. 

“Stop it,” Ptarra ordered. “It may 
have a camera, so don’t waste time. 
The less the builders learn about 
us, the better.” 

Arnek took off. His hunger had 
so far failed to weaken him, and he 
was covering the ground at two 
hundred miles an hour before the 
little vehicle had picked up a tenth 
of that speed. 

At the last moment, it seemed to 
be aware of him. There was a wash 
of mental shock and confusion. 
Then his snout hit the car in a side- 
swipe that tossed it fifty feet to 
land on its back. He lumbered for- 
ward to squash it, then hesitated. 
An opening had appeared and two 
of the tiny humans were staggering 
out. One was supporting the other. 
At sight of him, both stopped in 
shock. For a second, they stood 
rooted to the ground. Then the 



larger one began a clumsy effort 
at running, half carrying the other. 
Blood left a trail behind them. 

Arnek could have squashed them 
with a single trust of his leg. But 
he stood irresolutely, observing the 
garments and headgear they wore, 
remembering his youth and a gulla 
draped with a ribbon and bells. 
They were heading for the rocks 
nearest them, a long way from 
where the first two had found re- 
fuge. For a second, he felt impelled 
to turn them and drive them toward 
the others. 

Then a wave of amusement from 
Ptarra checked him. “They’d never 
reach that far,” she called. “They 
can’t survive the crash of their 
vehicle. Let them go.” 

A rnek felt the faint, murky 
mental signals so low on the 
band, and he knew Ptarra was right. 
They were staggering now, and the 
smaller one seemed to be only part- 
ly conscious. He sighed and scooped 
up the groimd car, carrying it back 
to Ptarra. 

This time his mate was making 
no effort to rip the ship apart. She 
was staring through one of the tiny 
ports, trying to fit her great eye 
against it. And she seemed uncer- 
tain. Finally she took the ground 
car and began dismantling it, look- 
ing for automatic or remote con- 
trols. 

There were none. 

“Maybe the creatures operated it 
— and the ship,” Arnek said. He 
expected the same reaction the re- 
mark had drawn before. 

This time Ptarra showed no 

111 



THE COURSE OF LOGIC 




amusement. Her great head shook 
in puzzlement. “About one time in 
ten thousand a crazy male hunch 
comes true,” she muttered. “Intui- 
tion! It’s against all logic. But there 
are only manual controls here. 
Where are those silly creatures?” 

The two that had arrived last 
were pitifully exposed, just within 
an opening in the rocks. It was a 
shallow space, hopeless to defend. 
The smaller one lay supine, but the 
larger human faced the two silths, 
holding his pitiful weapon, and 
waited grimly until they were almost 
within reach. This time the explo- 
sive pellets were aimed for their 
eyes. 

Ptarra dropped her eyelids, 
swearing as the missiles stung. She 
reached in with a short foreleg. 
There was a single shrill cry and 
the sound of the weapon striking 
against a rock; the low band was 
suddenly quiet. Arnek heard a soft 
gulp. When he looked, the larger 
human was gone. 

A sudden shock ran through 
Ptarra’s thoughts. Her great eyes 
blinked and a huge tongue ran over 
her lips. “Nerve fiber!” Her shout 
covered the entire spectrum. “Ar- 
nek, there arc pounds of nerve fiber 
in the creature! High grade — bet- 
ter than that in these silth forms. 
As good as that in any silth. Here, 
give me the other.” 

She didn’t wait for Arnek’s help, 
however. She dragged the corpse 
out and began working as delicately 
ms the silth body would permit. Her 
mental signals were a blur. Then 
she stopped, staring down at what 
she held. “There — a cavity in the 



head, filled with nerve fibers. There 
must be three pounds there alone. 
What freak of evolution would put 
them all together in such a vulner- 
able spot? And yet, there’s a certain 
efficiency about it. It isn’t logical 
— and yet it is.” 

Abruptly, the evidence was gone. 
“Come on,” she ordered. 

Arnek sighed, and his stomach 
rumbled a protest. But he ignored 
it. “What good is it? We surely can’t 
make a silth out of a tiny thing like 
that?” 

“Why not?” Contempt for male 
thought was mixed with smug satis- 
faction for her own. “We don’t use 
the other cells anyhow. Oh, there 
will be difficulties. They may be 
short-lived. But with such high grade 
fiber, we can risk infiltrating a new 
one as often as we need. There 
should be enough of them. They 
probably have half a dozen to a 
litter twice a year, like most small 
forms. Possibly billions of them can 
live on a single planet. And since 
they’re colonizing other worlds like 
this one. .” 

Even Arnek could see the logic 
behind Ptarra’s assumption in that. 
Colonizing would explain the send- 
ing out of a male and female in 
each ship, with ships spread out 
days apart. It wasn’t the most effi- 
cient method, but it usually insured 
against any major accident. His 
people had used the same method 
at times. 

It all seemed quite logical, but 
Arnek felt a tension of intuition 
along his entire nerve network. No 
anna had ever used a silth capable 
of independent intelligence. There 

IF 



112 




must be something wrong with it. 
Once they infiltrated the new silth, 
of course, they could soon convert 
enough nerves to blank out all con- 
trol from their carriers. But. 

“Their weapons,” he cried. “Ptar- 
ra, in those bodies, we’d be vulner- 
able to their weapons. And during 
the ten days we have to hibernate 
to grow into their nerves, they’d 
kill us.” 

Ptarra grunted. “Sometimes,” she 
admitted, “you almost think like a 
female. They would kill us, of 
course, if we stupidly stayed where 
later arrivals could find us. Now 
come on. We’ve got to chase the 
creatures around today until they’re 
tired enough to sleep soundly. And 
don’t let them get near that ship, 
either!” 

I t was a bitter day for Arnek. 

His stomach protested, and by 
the end of the chase, his legs were 
beginning to weaken. But ahead of 
them, the two humans were stag- 
gering in the light of the setting sun. 
The smaller was leaning on the 
larger as they finally found and en- 
tered the little cave near the ship 
that Ptarra had chosen for them 
long before. 

Night had fallen before Ptarra 
was satisfied. The two silths moved 
forward as softly as they could, but 
the loud breathing noises went on, 
and there was no stir of alarm any- 
where on the mental band. 

“Do you remember everything?” 
Ptarra asked. “You’ve got to regain 
consciousness after the first stage. 
You can do that, if you set your 
mind to it.” 



“I remember,” Arnek agreed 
wearily. He’d had the whole rou- 
tine drilled into him repeatedly un- 
till he was sick of it. It was like the 
horror of having her force him to 
adapt to this present silth. While 
he had been ready to accept assimi- 
lation, she had fought with him and 
with her own transformation, re- 
fusing to admit even his intuition 
that their race was ended. Only her 
cold logic had saved them. He could 
not deny it now. 

“Be sure you take the smaller 
male body,” she warned again. 

“Unless that’s the female. You 
found evolution different in these 
creatures once,” he reminded her. 

For a moment, she was silent. 
Then there was a mental shrug, and 
almost amusement as she answered. 
“Matching sex isn’t logically neces- 
sary. It might even be an interest- 
ing amusement. But I must have the 
larger body.” 

She began shifting at once. The 
silth gasped and tried to thresh 
about in death as Ptarra released 
control. Arnek sighed to himself and 
began to follow. 

It was worse than he remember- 
ed. After the centuries, the cells 
hated to give up their fixed form. 
The agony of the silth fed back to 
him, until his withdrawal stopped 
its heart. But slowly the nuclear 
matter flowed from the cells and 
up the pathways to their egress, tak- 
ing the minimum of nutrient fluid 
with them. 

It took nearly an hour, and he 
could see the thin film of Ptarra 
already lying over the sleeping hu- 
man. 



THE COURSE OF LOGIC 



113 




He began hurrying now, remem- 
bering her warning that the humans 
would not stay here once they 
wakened to find the two abandoned 
silths dead. He forced himself over 
the hateful dryness of the floor, up 
to the open mouth. Beyond lay the 
lungs, the circulatory system, and 
then the strange nerve bundle in 
the skull. 

Some of it was ugly, and some 
was hard. But the last stage was 
almost pleasant. He had forgotten 
how unsatisfactory the nerves of 
the last silth had been. These were 
like coming home to a friendly 
world, in a universe that had died 
too long ago and far away. For a 
time, he was almost glad that he 
had not died with it. 

Then the first allergic reactions 
began, and he had to relapse into 
instinct, to let his being fight to 
save both himself and his host cells 
from the reaction. 

He set the first stage up, how- 
ever. This time he managed with 
no help from Ptarra. Then he re- 
lapsed into unconsciousness, making 
no effort to control his new silth 
yet. He’d have to revise when the 
silth awoke, he told himself. 

But it was only a dream order, 
half completed. 

I t was a sudden painful pres- 
sure of acceleration that final- 
ly brought him out of his torpor. 
He felt half sick, and he could 
vaguely sense that the new silth was 
fevered and uncomfortable. But, 
amazingly, it was sitting up. And 
around it was a room bigger than 
the whole ship had seemed, and 

114 



controls under its hands, and fan- 
tastic equipment. 

“It’s about time,” Ptarra’s 
thoughts reached him. They were 
weak now, since it was hard to 
transmit in a partial stage, but they 
were cold and sure. “I’ve been aware 
for hours, while the silths reached 
the ship and took off. We’ve been 
off planet for at least an hour. Long 
enough to study their body controls 
and to learn how the ship operates.” 
Arnek sighed to himself, while 
the pressure of tension refused to 
leave. “Are you sure?” 

“Of course I’m sure! These are 
primitive machines, and I learned 
most of it from dismantling the first. 
They’re primitive — but they’re 
logical enough for understanding. I 
can even control the silth when she 
isn’t aware.” 

The larger human suddenly 
moved the controls, then jerked its 
hand back, staring at it. Words 
came to the ears of the silth in 
which Arnek rode. “I’m sick, Luke. 
I’ve got the twitches.” 

The words brought stirrings 
strongly on the low band, almost 
but not quite understandably. They 
also brought a vocal reply from the 
other human. “Be glad you can 
twitch. Some bug we picked up, 
but it’s metter than being eaten. 
We’re in the clover, kid. Maybe 
we still cop more cop ships tailing 
us, but let ’em look. When they find 
the dinosaurs and what’s left of our 
ship, they’ll stop looking. The heat’s 
going to be off! We can get back 
to Earth in a year or so and really 
live.” 

Ptarra’s thoughts cut through 

IF 




Arnek*s efforts to understand. “Re- 
production feelings,” she reported in 
satisfaction. “They must have higher 
fertility than I hoped if they can 
think of it while sick.” Then her 
thoughts sharpened. “Take over 
your si 1th!” 

The human at the board slumped 
abruptly. Arnek lashed out ^ from 
the converted cells, felt a brief pro- 
test, and then was alone in the brain 
of the sillh. 

He could not yet control it, but 
it had no independent will. 

“There is food and water near if 
we have to rouse from hibernation 
while we grow into these silths,” 
Ptarra reported. “Now — help me 
if you can.” 

Arnek let his weak thoughts blend 
into hers, trying to give strength as 
she had often done to him. She was 
straining her utmost will. 

Slowly and in jerks, the arm 
moved across the control board, and 
clumsy fingers managed to move 
controls. And at last, from Ptarra’s 
mind, Arnek began to see the plan. 

There was fuel enough to bring 
them at maximum speed across an 
eddy of the galaxy toward the lone 
sun they had found long before. 
There a single planet swung in orbit 
— a planet with food but ho dan- 
gerous animal life. And there they 
could wait and grow strong, and 
multiply as their silths multiplied. 
They could reach it almost as soon 
as they came out of hibernation 
finally, and it would be a safe haven 
in its isolation. 

There would be no fuel for fur- 
ther travel. But that copld wait, 
while their numbers grew, and they 



could restore their lost technology 
and weapons with the clever hands 
of the human silths. Then they could 
take over the galaxy — ns they had 
taken the one so long away! 

The hands fumbled under the 
limited control, but they moved 
across the board. And the automa- 
tic pilot was finally set and sealed. 

“Logic!” Arnek thought softly, 
and there was wonder at a mind 
like Ptarra’s that could achieve such 
understanding of even alien mechan- 
isms. Yet under it there was still a 
cold knot of fear along his nerves. 

Ptarra’s thoughts had begun to 
fade from the strain and the long 
interruption to her hibernation. But 
now she caught momentary control 
again. There was appreciation in 
them for his praise. And then there 
was amusement. “Logic,” she 
agreed. “But perhaps intuition isn’t 
too bad for a male. You’ve been 
right twice.” 

“Twice?” Arnek asked. He’d been 
somehow right that the silths con- 
trolled their own ships, of course. 
But. 

“Twice,” Ptarra said. “Fve just 
realized my silth is a male, as you 
suggested it might be. Amusing, re- 
versing the sexes, isn’t it?” 

She tried to say something else, 
but the strain was too much, and 
full hibernation swept her mind 
away from that of Arnek. 

Arnek sat frozen for a time in 
his silth, knowing that it was also 
male. 

Then he turned it somehow to face 
the lost galaxy where his race had 
knov'm its day and now entered its 
eternal night. END

THE CUSTOMS LOUNGE 

BY E. A. PROULX 

Anything can happen in the 
customs lounge — since they 
let those Earth people in! 



T here were usually a few Cus- 
toms Inspectors in the lounge, 
waiting to begin their shifts, hang- 
ing around trading news and inci- 
dents and drinking the bad, luke- 
warm kasser that was a standing 
joke in the Immigration-Customs 
Service. 

Old Grag was telling for perhaps 
the eightieth time of a success of 
his when he young in the Service. 

. They had this small box of 
sticky, squashy sweets with them. 
The young one was eating one. Many 
another inspector would have passed 
them through, but I thought the 
young one chewed too much and 
too loud. So I said, ‘Mind if I have 
one?’’ 

“ ‘Wahl’ says they together, ‘it 
would set you on edge, Noble Wise 
Inspector. It is the taste of another 
world.’ They was Venusers, and they 
started shifting and hopping around, 
and humming their national anthem, 
you know how they used to do back 
in the old days. 1 made quite 



a nice little find. Almost a half-scree 
of chamfer in each one of those 
sweets. I got a promotion out of 
that, and the Venusers got a six-year 
close out.” 

Inspector Flimp blew one of his 
noses loudly. 

“Hee, that’s nothing. / recall back 
when we first opened up for Immi- 
gration, and a whole shipload of 
earthers came in. I'hey were cram- 
med in like tigs in a nest, and as 
usual they didn’t know one word of 
the language, they didn’t have any 
idea of where to go or how to do 
anything, and they’d got separated 
from their controller. They just 
stood around, huddled together and 
jabbering at each other. Well, I 
checked out about twenty of them, 
and then there comes up this big 
ugly female. Well, I jacks the eleva- 
tor up some more, and I looks down 
at her. 

“ ‘Name!’^ I call. ‘Gladdis Crackle- 
gill,’ or some other weird earth name 
she screams at me. ‘Too much 



116 



iV 



name,’ I say. ‘You’ve got enough 
name there for five of you. Which 
will you choose, Glad, Is, Crack, 
El or Giir 

“Well, it took me a while to make 
her understand me — my earth accent 
wasn’t too good then, and she was 
slow-headed, having only one, like 
all earthers. But I finally made her 
understand what I wanted to know, 
and then, by Clag, what a ramping 
frowst she did make! 

“It was while she was screeching 
at me that I noticed her teeth were 
pretty big. even for such a huge 
beast as she was. So I secretly turned 
on the Dento-Spyer, right into her 
jaws, and what a sight on the view 
screen! Each of those big teeth was 
false and filled to the top with Earth 
seeds she was trying to smuggle!^’ 
“Earthers!” exploded young Nask. 
“They make me sick!” 

“I’m with you, Nask,” said In- 
spector Sprim. “And I don’t under- 
stand why they still keep routing 
earthers through Immigration any- 
way. They claim they’re a border- 
line case, but when you’ve seen as 
many as I have, you know, which 
side of the border they’re on.” 

N ask went off to the kasser dis- 
penser and his place was taken 
by Brif, the head Inspector, who had 
been listening. 

“Un-edge yourself, Sprim,” smiled 
Brif, contracting one of his heads. 
“I have good news, rare news and 
fine news. The Four Council decision 
just came down to us. Earthers are 
now to be routed through Livestock 
instead of Immigration beginning 
very soon.” 



A cheer went up from the little 
group of Customs and Immigration 
officials. The one Livestock Inspec- 
tor in the lounge groaned in despair. 

Old Inspector Flimp seemed both- 
ered. 

“They’ve made themselves a mis- 
take,” he sputtered. “Earthers can be 
clever and tricky even after they’re 
altered. Why, I seen them pull every 
trick in the book coming through 
here. Did I ever tell you about the 
stunted one with an artificial head 
who tried to pass himself off as a 
rest-park planner? Well, it seems 
that ...” 

Two young, but large inspectors 
sneaked away from the group when 
they saw old Flimp was launched 
into one of his dull yarns again. 

Outside the lounge, after a quick 
look up and down the hall, they 
ducked into the robot-cleaner stor- 
age closet. 

“Boy,” gasped the shorter inspec- 
tor. “I had to get out of there. Be- 
sides the torture of listening to that 
two-headed monster babble on and 
on about how he outwitted earthers 
when he was still able to move 
around, this miserable thing has start- 
ed to come loose again.” 

He gave an impatient wrench to 
his left head, and it wobbled enough 
to expose some of the delicate wires 
that the earth robotic engineer had 
labored over so many hours. 

The other began tightening straps 
and buckles for him. 

“There,” he said finally. “You 
look like one of the boys again.” 

Laughing together, the earthers 
went back into the Customs Lounge.

THRELKELD’S 

DAUGHTER 

BY JAMES BELL 



She was only a space captain’s 
daughter — and all she wanted 
was a human to call her own! 



X Tight was a diamond studded 
I ^ dream from where they sat. 
The moon was a maiden on wing 
suggesting amorous flight, fnside 
the stuffiness of the celluloid-like ve- 
hicle there was absolutely no hint 
of discomfort or absurd misfittings 
— despite the fact that Threlkeld and 
his daughter were now shaped out 
of all proportions to the conveyor 
itself. 

“You seem unusually drawn,” 
Threlkeld suggested from his prone 
positition on the floor of the craft. 

Gelerie took a deep, sensual sigh. 
“It is the pill, 1 am sure.” 



•TLook at you,” Threlkeld mutter- 
ed, “and look at me — we’re perhaps 
the most unique imitation of humans 
the galaxy has ever produced.” 
Again there was a maddening si- 
lence . maddening to Threlkeld. 
“My daughter,” he said at length, 
disturbed, “I must remind you of the 
importance of this little mission. My 
entire career with the inter-star pa- 
trol depends on how well we func-

Gelerie was bent in a heap near 
the tapering nose of the pod-shaped 
vehicle as it hurtled past the lovely 
moon, headlong toward a giant green

and pmple planet below them. 
Hurtled in a vessel with no manual 
controls, a vessel grown in a govern- 
ment garden on another world . 
catapulted on a very special assign- 
ment to a planet that neither grew 
missiles nor thought of launching 
them without myriads of mechanical 
wires, dials and blinker lights. 

Now Threlkeld was filled with in- 
dignation. “Gelerie, I command 
you — ” 

“Yes, Father. You command me,” 
she drawled. 

“Unless you remain attentive, 
my daughter, we may fail. Failing, 
I must concede that I have finally 
grown too old for spatial duty, and 
be sent to the Home. Do you want 
that?” 

Gelerie had acquired all the attri- 
butes of a beautiful, buxom Earth 
girl. She looked up in the soft light 
that glowed its phosphorous loveli- 
ness from the very walls of the seed 
pod they occupied. Threlkeld mut- 
tered, “Such beauty — it is beyond all 
that the textbooks described.” 

Now Gelerie butted in, “The 
trouble, my father, is simple. The 
transition pills — ” 

“What about them?” 

“They do more than convert us 
from a six-footed tree-hanging crea- 
ture of the Alpha Centauri group. 
They impose upon us the same emo- 
tional stress of the human. You 
know, father, I have been changed 
into leopards, rhinos and snoqualli- 
mie eels before; but always I re- 
tained my own natural traits — the 
love of trees, the desire to return to 
my naive form and habitat as quick- 
ly as possible. But this time, I feel 



demure and attractive and extremely 
vain and — ” 

“I warn you, my daughter. I am 
old. I have seen these Earth types 
at work. They are a useless breed. 
Their extra-curricular activities are 
beyond all reason. Very few of them 
stick to what is really important. 
Very few of them understand that 
achievement of the goal is the only 
thing there is. Now, I suggest you 
fight off these emotions. Try not to 
succumb to human frailities, for we 
have an important job to do — lest 
your poor father be put out to pas- 
ture.” 

T he sound of empty space beside 
them was almost unnoticeable. 
The swish, so familiar for such 
speeds near their own planetary 
chain far out in the universe, was 
now missing. 

As they approached the Earth, a 
thin crescent of daylight appeared to 
their right. 

“Father,” Gelerie said, “I cannot 
help myself. I am in love with this 
Earth form. I have this — this deep 
sense of beauty, of love, of desire. 
I cannot seem to quell it.” 

Threlkeld tried to help her with 
logic. “Homekind gave us the pills 
for a brief mission. I have lived long 
enough not to desire these human 
qualities. You are much younger and 
have much more to learn. Homekind 
devised these pills for but one pur- 
pose — you are to lure a young man 
of your choosing into our vehicle. 
He will then be transported home, 
and your father will have his old job 
back on the ferry to Betelgeuse. Do 
not fail me, Gelerie.” 



120 



IF 




A bright, mercury-like flood of 
daylight appeared, and Threlkeld ex- 
plained to her that it was light from 
the Earth’s source of life, the solar 
body they had passed. He explained 
that Homekind was now selecting by 
remote control their landing site. 

The pod now skittered through the 
skies, safely avoiding other space 
craft which Earth might have sent 
up. 

Threlkeld’s mind left his daugh- 
ter and consumed the view below 
them. A grand chasm of blue-green, 
an ocean. Strips of sand here and 
there along a vast continental shelf. 
Thick vegetation on the continent. 
An excess of river inlets. All impor- 
tant bearings on their location should 
they need to call home for help. He 
observed the scene with satisfaction. 

And then they were slowing to a 
snail’s pace, and Homekind was se- 
lecting a clearing in the sand along 
the shore of a river. Then the seed 
pod, its shape so much like that of 
the zephyr of Earth, twisted whirly- 
bird fashion to the ground. Threl- 
keld lifted the rear of the container, 
and stiffly the two Earth imitations 
stepped out. 

“Now we roll the vehicle into the 
trees.” They carefully gathered sticks 
and bramble from the water’s edge 
and made a natural pile of debris in 
front of the pod, so that anyone 
glancing its way would never see the 
brownish green vehicle for other 
than was intended to be seen — a 
mound of dried clay. 

“Now where are we, father?” Gel- 
erie asked, as she stretched herself 
into shape. 

“We are but ten miles from the 



city harbor. We will skirt the river- 
bank for a boat. Homekind left 
nothing untended — which is why 
you — ” 

“Why I must not fail,” she replied 
drily. “I know. I must not fail. But 
I must be allowed to enjoy my Earth 
form for a while. It is beautiful.” 
She looked him squarely in the eye. 
“It is beautiful, is it not, father? Am 
1 not more beautiful than you have 
ever seen me?” 

“Homekind makes recordings of 
our conversations, my daughter . 
as it is psychiatrically right that they 
should. And in their analyses, I do 
not want them to have to ever say 
that Threlkeld succumbed to the skin- 
deep world of the Earth people. I 
must warn you again, Gelerie,” he 
went on, “that Earth people base 
nearly all of their existence, their 
plans, their hopes on how attractive 
they may be, how young or how old 
they may look, how withered their 
skin. For they live chiefly for vanity, 
very little else.” 

The way Gelerie sighed told him 
he had failed. “One thing more, my 
daughter,” he said in another at- 
tempt. “Homekind made you that at- 
tractive merely for the purpose of 
luring this male Earth creature into 
our conveyor. Now can you do it? 
Will you keep your mind on your 
task?” 

Gelerie said, “Where will you be, 
father?” 

“I will make the selection for you. 
Then I will transfer my mind into 
yours, just to make certain you com- 
plete your task.” 

The girl was lost again in self-ap- 
praisal. She extended her supple hu- 



THRELKELD'S DAUGHTER 



121 




man arms and legs and observed 
them almost lovingly. “I like the 
short garments they wear. Such 
beauty should never be hidden.” 

“Homekind arranged it that way 
with a definite purpose in mind. 
Remember that,” he said, now trot- 
ting ahead to find some sign of a 
boat. He was about to give up, afraid 
to admit Homekind might have 
erred, when Gelerie shrieked, “Look 
— over that way. A leafboat.” 

A warm sense of thanks went out 
from Threlkeld silently. He led the 
way to the large blue-green leaf that 
lay flat upon the water, stiffened 
with wax, water-resistant, entirely 
buoyant. They pulled it close and 
stepped aboard. 

There was no need for paddles, 
since a modified leafboat constructed 
by Homekind and transported by 
Homekind always naturally had 
built-in propulsion. Tiny molecules 
of water were converted along the 
underside of the leaf into a moder- 
ate amount of energy which shoved 
them forward under Homekind’s 
magnetic command toward a col- 
lection of tall glass spires. 

“Remember, Gelerie,” Threlkeld 
said to the dreaming girl who let her 
hand dangle in the waters of Earth, 
“mv future is at stake. You are a six- 
footed tree-hanging creature. You 
will return to your native form the 
moment our mission is completed. 
Now I will not warn you again. An- 
other moody spell and we return to 
the vehicle with only one thing as- 
sured — Threlkeld the Great’s im- 
pending retirement.” 

But if he expected an assurance 
out of Gelerie that she would not 



fail, he was wrong, for she did not 
respond. 

T hey abandoned the leaf boat as 
the foot of a sign, which in their 
compact Earth-translation scheme 
provided by one milligram of the 
pill they had taken, said, Forty-sec- 
ond Street. They scaled the elevated 
structures with almost natural ani- 
mal precision and carefully dodged 
the ground vehicles that sped toward 
them on ramps. Then they were on 
the premises of their destination. A 
large white building touching the sky, 
and beside it a curved, oblong struc- 
ture which Threlkeld whispered con- 
tained Earth’s government. 

“He is to be a diplomat?” she 
asked. 

“Sh,” he said, as people hurried 
past them, turning to inspect Gel- 
crie’s brief toggery. 

They ascended a ramp to the 
glassed foyer. Then they were inside, 
gaping at the height of the ceiling, 
at the overhanging balconies. A 
young woman with Oriental qualities 
approached them. “May I be of as- 
sistance?” 

“Oh, Father,” Gelerie said, fasci- 
nated at the human voice. 

“We wish,” Threlkeld began 
guardedly, “to speak with the young- 
est member of the world govern- 
ment — ” 

“That would be the Congo, sir.” 
“Not nation. Individual staff 
member. Person. Human. Youngest 
in years,” Threlkeld explained. 

“Twenty-one is generally as young 
as anyone is allowed — as clerks and 
aides, sir. That would be the mini- 
mum age. Diplomatic corpsmen are 

IF 



122 




usually considerably older,^ 

•*Very well. The nearest and 
youngest of the aides.” 

“I can think of Monsieur Joffrion 
of France or Sahib Masher of 
Arabia.” 

Threlkeld was now weeding out 
difficulties. Homekind had given 
them access to one language only. 
“Someone who speaks the language 
I am speaking.” 

The girl frowned. “Sir, you do not 
know what language you speak?” 

A bolt of fear shot through Threl- 
keld’s earth stomach. “Of course I 
know. The point is, do you know?” 
“English,” the frustrated guide 
said. “Very well, I will secure Mr. 
Twitty of the British delegation. 
Come this way, sir, madam.” 

Threlkeld forced a deep intake of 
oxygen. He smiled at Gelerie and 
they followed the girl to an elevator. 
When they alighted, they were es- 
corted down a hall to the doorway 
marked. Delegation of the United 
Kingdom. 

Then the guide turned to Threl- 
keld and said, “I have instructions to 
learn the nature of your mission be- 
fore introducing you, sir.” 

Threlkeld had hoped it would not 
come to this. But better to tell the 
girl than foil the chance now. “I 
want the young man to fall in love 
with my daughter. Then I am going 
to kidnap him and whisk him off to 
a faraway planet.” There, he had 
said it. Homekind had told him to 
say it if necessary. The truth would 
be the one thing the Earthlings would 
never believe, they had told him. 
The Oriental girl laughed and said, 
“Sir, I admit defeat. Mr. Twitty will 
THRELKELD’S DAUGHTER 



have to take it from here.” She stuck 
her head inside the door and whis- 
tled softly. 

“Pip, pip, Yu-lin,” came the juve- 
nile voice of the young man inside. 
“What’s the bother, old girl?” 

“A man and his daughter to see 
you.” 

“And the nature of their visit?” 

“They want you to fall in love 
with the beautiful girl, and then her 
father will escort you on a nice 
honeymoon to some love spot in 
romantic night sky.” As Yu-lin 
spoke, she turned her bright oriental 
eyes to Threlkeld and winked. 

Threlkeld felt his blood rush hot. 
In a mental transit to his daughter, 
he said, “I think it high time I trans- 
ferred my mind to you. You need 
all the moral stamina you can get, 
and I see the power these Earthlings 
have on the opposite sex. It is not 
good. Prepare fhe cavity of your 
brain,” he instructed, and seeing that 
Gelerie was a million light years 
away, Threlkeld made the mind- 
switch alone and aimed his body at a 
door marked Men*s Room. Soon it 
disappeared. 

T ‘he young Earthman rushed for- 
ward, unconcerned with the in- 
ternal workings of Threlkeld, fid- 
dling with his frog glasses and blink- 
ing as if he did not see well. Gelerie 
saw that he was thin, tall, sandy- 
haired and extremely good looking. 
Her heart pounded and Threlkeld’s 
mind said, “Watch out.” The young 
man smiled and extended his hand 
to Gelerie. “You’ll have to forgive 
the guide, madam. She sometimes 
gets carried away. I am Twitty of 

123 




the U.K. So glad to have you 
aboard.” 

A nudge somewhere near Gelerie’s 
brain awakened her. “I am afraid I 
am here for a very strange reason 
— the very reason Yu-lin stated. I 
want you to fall in love with me.” 
Twitty replaced his glasses. “I 
think ril go back and come out 
again. My dear, you are a lovely 
creature, but back home I am en- 
gaged to a girl who won three local 
beauty contests on the way to the 
title of Miss Britain.” 

“And did she win Miss Britain?” 
Twitty’s mouth dropped. “What 
are you trying to say?” 

“1 am trying to say, sir, leave 
your Miss Britain who did not quite 
make it and fly aWay with me to 
Alpha Centauri — ” 

“Oh. come now,” Twitty said 
laughing. “In that brief toggery you 
expect me to believe you are some 
moon maiden from a midsummer 
night’s dream and go wandering with 
you through loveland in the sky? Go 
back to your fairy tale, Miss — ” 
“Gelerie.” 

“Gelerie what?” 

“Gelerie is all they gave me in the 
Alpha Centauri group. We have a 
home-grown vehicle waiting in the 
woods. And a leafboat at the foot 
of Forty-second Street to carry us 
under its own power to the site of 
the vehicle. We covered the vehicle 
with driftwood to protect it lest some 
Earthling should swipe it and Home- 
kind be forced to grow us another.” 
Twitty called over his shoulder. 
“Brighton? Take over for a little 
while. I shall return by and by.” But 
the allure of the woman creature in 



short pants was drawing him near. 
“May I see this thing in the woods?” 
“Of course,” she said, and she 
could feel the mental smile of Threl- 
keld inside her brain as it seemed to 
take a deep, relieved breath. 

They descended the elevator and 
come out at the main exit. Twitty 
bolted forward and grabbed a guard 
by the arm. “Sir, I wish you to arrest 
this woman on suspicion as an alien 
from outer space or a candidate for 
Bellevue.” 

A burly guard with a kind face 
looked into Gelerie’s eyes. Now her 
father’s brain was at anxiety’s peak, 
calling the plays. “Go ahead, double 
your fingers into a fist, shove it for- 
ward. now, under his jaw — ” 

“But — ” Gelerie was stammering. 
“No buts!” Threlkeld’s internal in- 
structions poured. “When Homekind 
made you beautiful, my dear, they 
also made you big. You are an 
Amazon.” 

“Amazon?” 

“No time to explain,” he said. “Let 
the bruiser have one!” 

Gelerie shrugged and took a swing. 
The arms of the guard shot skyward, 
and the big, hulking body in uniform 
fell backwards and plopped against 
the floor. As he rose up, shouting, 
Gelerie grabbed the slim Mr. Twitty 
around the waist, lifted him bodily 
and ran like a sudden gale through 
the lobby, out the door, down the 
ramp and to the river. With an 
Olympic leap, she made it to the 
stable, sturdy leafboat. 

O n orders from Homekind the 
craft quietly slid toward the 
trysting place, Gelerie was aware of 

IF 



124 




a flood of congratulations from her 
father in her brain. 

Twitty was red with humiliation. 
“You know, of course, they will be 
flying over us momentarily. You’ll 
be courtmartialed, or whatever it is 
they do to the American kidnapers 
of international (diplomatic corps 
persons.” 

“You don’t like me,” Gelerie 
pouted. “1 came all the way from 
Alpha Centauri to take you home 
with me and you don’t even as much 
as like me.” 

The young Englishman lifted Gel- 
erie’s chin and studied her tears. “By 
jove, they are not crocodilian. I be- 
lieve you are serious. You are inno- 
cent and serious. .strong, of course, 
but innocent.” 

“I love you. I want no one but 
you,” she said. 

“I can see there would be an ad- 
vantage in a fellow my size having a 
wife your size,” he said reflectively. 
“But Babs would never approve.” 

Gelerie shrugged her broad shoul- 
ders. She hugged herself lovingly. 
“Babs can always get another fellow. 
I’ll never be able to get another guy.” 

‘‘Why? Are you planning to resign 
from the human race?” 

“That’s exactly it,” she agreed. 
“However, if I get you to come back 
with me, Homekind may consent to 
my staying in the human form and 
living with you the rest of my life.” 

Twitty laughed. “Boys, come and 
get me,” he muttered at the sky. 
Threlkeld stayed on guard mentally, 
and Gelerie depressed into a morose, 
human activity known as sinking 
one’s head into one’s knees. 

The U.K. man’s laugh turned 
THRELKELD’S DAUGHTER 



abruptly to awe when he saw the 
helicopter flutter over them and land 
on a spot of riverbank just ahead. 
Vaguely he could see military pilots, 
and two civilians hop out and run 
for the woods. He watched with dis- 
turbed concern as the leafboat made 
a sharp right turn of its own volition 
and headed for the bank. 

Now Gelerie arose, picked him 
up by the waist and carried him 
bodily toward the gathering. The 
militia were uncovering the seed pod. 

“Twitty,” one of the men called. 
“What in heaven’s name is she doing 
to you?” 

“You’ll never guess,” he fumed. 
“She’s taking me to Alpha Centauri.” 
“You don’t mean it!” his crony 
replied. “Whatever will Babs think?” 
The military men ran back to the 
group. “Cadogan, sir. I believe you’d 
better come look. That clay mound 
behind all the rubble. It is just like 
the old man said it would be.” 
Gelerie looked and saw her father 
at the vehicle. She raced forward 
with Twitty scratching and kicking. 

Cadogan said, “We found the old 
man wandering aimlessly. We asked 
him to show us where he came from. 
He kept pointing until we landed 
here. He has an excellent memory, 
but something has control of him. 
Something very sinister and weird, 
Twitty.” 

Inside, Gelerie was getting a 
strong command from Threlkeld. 
“Get close, much closer. How can I 
effect a transit until you come within 
the required distance?” 

She thought-replied, “Well, get out 
of the pod so I can see you.” 

“No! Get inside quickly. Home- 

125 




kind is ready whenever we are. Bring 
Twitty in with you and we’ll be 
away!” 

Now the military men and Cado- 
gan were clearing away the debris, 
half stumbling, half confused. “Get 
the girl. Don’t let her get in that 
thing. No matter how absurd their 
story, don’t let her get aboard that 
■ — that seed pod!” 

“Amazon,” T h r e 1 k e 1 d yelled. 
“Amazon, Amazon, Amazon! Gel- 
erie — ” 

A t that, Gelerie dropped Twitty 
and began swinging with both 
fists. She laid out two helicopter pi- 
lots and a civilian. She retrieved 
Twitty and her father said, “Now, 
get the devil in this pod so I can 
transfer back to the body! Then wc 
can revert to type, I said get the 
devil in the pod so — ” 

“No!” 

“Gelerie,” his voice stormed, shat- 
tering her peace of mind. 

“No. If we go back to Alpha,” 
she said, “I’ll be a six-legged amphib- 
ian and Twitty will be a handsome 
human. He won’t even know me!” 
Twitty looked at her. “Wh-who 
are addressing?” 

From inside the voice thundered 
on. “Think of your father, who has 
worked all his life for you! Just one 
more assignment with interstar pa- 
trol. Even ferry duty will suffice. 
Please let me have my specimen and 
my body, Gelerie! Please go inside 
the seed pod. Homekind will kill me 
in hours if 1 fail.” 

Gelerie held Twitty at a distance. 
“I can’t do it. I can’t leave him.” 
“Then bring him with you. What 



I keep telling you we came for — ” 
“Not as human-animal versus ani- 
mal-animal,” she said. “I love him. 
I can’t harm him.” 

“In the ship, Gelerie! For your 
old Daddy. Inside, girl. In — ” 
Gelerie was now close enough to 
permit her father’s mind to transit. 
From inside he spoke aloud, “Well, 
thank Homekind for that! Now get 
in and we’ll be off.” 

“What about one of the others?” 
she said, now pointing at the three 
men who lay unconscious at her feet. 

“That would be fine,” Threlkeld 
replied. “Just loss Twitty in the drink 
and bring Cadogan. He looks like 
good stock.” 

Twitty was suddenly stricken with 
fright. If he never believed before, 
he believed now. “No. Cadogan has 
a wife and children. Don’t take him 
— take me, I’m unmarried.” 

“Well,” Threlkeld said, “now it’s 
all solved. Get on board, Gelerie.” 
“No, father. If I do that, I still be- 
come less than Twitty. Homekind 
does not respect love affairs between 
separate types.” 

“Nor does it allow its 'missionaries 
to remain in the arena after the 
battle is won. Gelerie, face it if you 
stay here you’ll revert to type the in- 
stant I leave.” 

Gelerie turned Twitty loose. She 
bent low and looked through the 
opening of the vehicle at her father. 
“Do you think Homekind would do 
that other thing?” She said it so 
Twitty would not guess right off. 

“Nonsense. It would defeat the 
whole purpose of the mission,” 
Threlkeld said. “They want a human 
specimen. Taking him home and 

IF 



126 




turning him into one of us would not 
give them any new thing to study. 
You’ll have to do better than that.” 
“I meant here. Make him one of 
our kind and let him stay here.” 
Threlkeld said, “Only if you can 
produce some human to take his 
place.” 

Gelerie thought a moment. “What 
is the time limit on this mission?” 
“A year, Earth time. Two years 
at the outside.” 

“And the period of human gesta- 
tion?” 

“Nine months, ten days and — 
what gives?” 

“I shall marry Twitty, give Home- 
kind a human specimen — my own 
— in nine months and ten days. You 
tell Homekind of my plan. Let them 
hear the recording. Then return and 
be with me. I shall, one hour very 
soon, invite Twitty to sojourn with 
me on the completion of this mission, 
father. I guarantee you, Homekind 
be with me, he will not want to see 
me go the rest of the way alone.” 
Threlkeld said, “My daughter’s 
mind is full of strange logic, but it 
makes good sense. But be extremely 
careful my dear. The human is a 
deceitful thing. He will kiss your 
lips while stabbing your back.” 



Gelerie turned to Twitty and said, 
“How would you like to have six legs 
and swing from the tree by your 
tail?” 

She turned and spoke, “See, fa- 
ther? He faints so readily. He will 
be quite easily handled.” But her hu- 
man eyes had not adjusted perfectly 
to Earth’s thick atmosphere. She 
suddenly did not see the vehicle con- 
taining her father. Then, far beyond 
the clouds of sunset, she detected a 
small dot sailing off into the deep 
blue, its side reflecting gold. “Fare- 
well for now, my father,” she whis- 
pered. 

T urning to the helicopter, she car- 
ried three subdued men and 
placed them aboard. Then she lift- 
ed Twitty softly to her shoulders 
and muttered, “Homekind, fly me 
to their quarters. I am weary for the 
moment and do not feel like oper- 
ating the controls.” 

The copter lifted silently, swinging 
out over the East River. Though 
cramped, Gelerie found a place be- 
side her for Twitty. 

When he bad stopped shaking, she 
whistled softly as the Oriental girl 
had and kissed him as an Amazon 
might. END

The Place Where Readers 
And Editor Meet... 



Dear Editor: 

In the past few issues // has 
made itself, I feel, one of the main 
■cience-fiction magazines. Its qual- 
ity has come up astonishingly. 

In the July issue. Emsh, with his 
cover illustration and interior work, 
reinforced in my mind my high 
opinion of him. How about an all- 
Emsh issue? 

Before your July issue, you may 
remember, I wrote you and said that 
I’d gladly do a flip for more Van 
Vogt like what's-his-name did for 
Heinlein. Then I went on to say, 
‘‘But I guess that isn’t too likely.” 
Well, what can I say? Except “ugh” 
aa I land on my back .

Dear Editor: 

As an SF fan for the last 15 years, 



I feel entitled to sound off to the 
writers. So with your permission. 

SF writers attention! 

I hereby propose the following 
manifesto in regard to future sf 
stories: 

In first-contact-with-alien stories, 
let’s have one of the parties equip- 
ped with automatic translators, and 
let’s get on with the story. If I have 
to suffer through another of those 
long, laborious processes of “Me 
Tarzan — Him No. 3 Planet” strug- 
gles, I just might give up sf and take 
up golf. 

On the subject of girls: Now, 
they’re all right, don’t get me wrong. 
But let’s vary it a bit. I mean all 
this “terrific figrure, full breasts, 
scanty garments” stuff is getting, 
well, duW, believe it or not. Let’s set 
up a code numbering system, like 
No. 1-blonde, 38-24-38. No. 2-bru- 
nette, 36-24-36, etc. Think of the 
space we’d save! 

Spaceships: By now everyone’s 

IF 



12t 




heard of hyperdriye (that’s where 
you call Einstein a liar by groins 
faster than light), so let’s just ttss 
it, all right? 

Aliens: Those little green men, or 
LGM as we call them for short — 
they’re well, don’t you think it’s 
time for something new? Maybe 
even humans.

Dear Editor: 

Do you suppose I could have a bit 
of space in your letter column to 
mention to your readers that there 
is a contest now being run, for the 
third consecutive year, in fact, for 
amateur sf authors? 

It is run by the NFFF, the larg- 
est fan group of them all. Awards, 
three of them, are in cash. It is 
open to everyone who has sold less 
than three stories professionally. 
Stories must be less than 5,000 words 
— fantasy, sf or weird. 

There is something in this for 
everyone; even the youngest writer 
who has little more than enthusiasm 
will find out why they don’t sell. 
We can pretty well guarantee at 
least a page of criticism — which, 
as anyone who submits at all regu- 
larly to prozines is well aware, is 
generally not available to the writ- 
er. The editors just don’t have time 
to tell the would-be authors why 
they don’t make it. For the complete 
rules, write me. 

Clayton Hamilin

Maine 

• If neither sponsors nor partici- 
pates in this contest — but we think 
it’s a Good Thing. Especially for 



^ose new writers who pretty well 
know their stories aren’t quite right 
to be published, and want to get a 
second person’s view on why they 
aren’t That we’re just not able to 
do. 

We are able to do one thing to- 
ward encouraging new talent, 
though, and that is to print some of 
it. As regular readers know, each 
issue we bring you at least one 
story by a new writer. This issue 
there are two : The Tune of Cold, 
by a young lady from South Dakota, 
and The Customs Lounge, by a folk- 
singing, star-gazing man from up- 
state New York. We like ’em — 
hope you will too! — Editor.

Dear Editor: 

Your July issue was good, but 
there were a few things about it 
that had a distinct aroma of the 
‘‘old” If. 

Mighiest Qom: OK, but for some 
reason it seemed like a rewritten 
Relief of the Red-Tape Mountain 
(May, ’62). Why does Retief always 
beat up on those poor little aliens? 
Earth should be up to its neck in 
space wars by now, but we always 
seem to end up with the BE M’s on 
our side. Don’t get me wrong. I 
think Retief is a great guy, but 
sometimes he seems very like a 
comic-book hero. 

Down to the Worlds of Men: Quite 
a story! I’d like to see more of this 
fellow’s work. 

The Faces Outside: This story 

tears up and burns the '^Worlds of 
Galaxy Rejects*" bit, especially when 
you add to it the great Turning 
Point and Singleminded of May. 

In the Arena: Actually this story 
reminded me of the E. R. Burroughs

Dear Editor: 

Something bugged me about the 
May If. Pederson's cover from 
Turning Point was great, but — 

I thought Mierna had blonde hair 
and blue skin, not black hair and 
brown skin. Don't tell me I'm color- 
blind! Don't get me wrong, though 
— everything else about the issue 
was supreme!

• Well, we can explain that. The 
chain of communications between the 
author and the artist rests on one 
weak link. We're it. We goofed in 
transmitting the descriptions. — Ed^

Dear Editor: 

How lucky you are! So many ama- 
teur editors and critics to help you 
run your magazine (art experts, 
too!) Particularly one Douglas Tay- 
lor of Elephant's Breath, Kansas, 
who, in his distinguished critique, 
off-handedly recommends that you 
^'eject Relief", thus causing me to 
write my first letter to any editor 
in all my years of science-ficion ad- 
diction. 

We live in troublesome times in- 
deed, Mr. Taylor of Elephant's Ear, 
Kansas, times in which mediocrity 
is the standard and the art of gen- 
tle satire is all but extinct. Hit 'em 
with an ax or they don’t dig you. I 



must take exception where Relief is 
concerned — a rare combination of 
‘‘action -adventure yarn" and intel- 
lectual type humor of a sort that 
appeals to me. 

Back to you, dear editor. I'm sure 
that you are doing your experienced 
best to produce a fine magazine and 
I for one will continue to wade 
through good stories and bad, good 
illustrations and poor, leaving all 
the decisions up to you — saving only 
that you hang onto Relief for me!

Hal Clement is really good. He is

Norkolden*s Millions and the early

12 famous authors start a 
new kind of writing school 



If you have writing talent worth developing, 
here’s an opportunity never before available: 

Twelve of America’s most famous authors 
have created a school of professional writing 
to help you develop your skill, talent and 
craftsmanship . and to pass on to you their 
secrets of achieving success and recognition. 

This unique home-training program is su- 
pervised by Rod Serling, winner of five Em- 
mys for TV writing; Pulitzer Prize historian 
Bruce Catton; best-selling novelist Faith 
Baldwin; humorist Max (Dohie Gillis) Shul- 
man; publisher-columnist Bennett Cerf; 
famed sportswriter Red Smith; Rudolf Flesch, 
top authority on readable writing; noted lan- 
guage expert Prof. Bergen Evans; famous 
mystery novelist Mignon G. Eberhart; J. D. 
Ratcliff, called by Time “America’s No. 1 
craftsman in the field of non-fiction”; and 
top ad men John Caples and Mark Wiseman. 

These famous authors have developed ^ 
remarkable series of textbooks, lessons and 
writing assignments that present — in a clear 
and stimulating way — what they have learned 
in their long, hard climb to the top. 

The School’s instructors are themselves 
professional writers. Under the supervision 
of the 12 Famous Writers, these instructors 
work with students by mail, just as magazine 
and book editors work with many established 
authors. And they spend up to several hours 



on each assignment completed by a student 
. revising, correcting, and advising. 

The Famous Writers School is less than 
three years old. Its first students are not due 
to graduate until later this year. Yet, many 
have sold their writings to such varied publi- 
cations as The Reader's Dlf^est, Redhook, 
Popular Science, True Story. 

To select people with writing talent worth 
developing, the 12 Famous Writers have de- 
signed a revealing Talent Test. The coupon 
will bring you a copy, along with a brochure 
about the School. Your completed Test will 
be graded without charge or obligation by 
one of the School’s instructors. If your Test 
indicates writing talent, you are then eligible 
to enroll in the School. You are, however, un- 
der absolutely no obligation to do so. 



Famous Writers School 

Dept. 6307, Westport, Connecticut 
I am interested in finding out whether I have writ- 
ing talent worth developing. Please mail me, with-
