Looking For Us, Professor? 

"Hmm, yes. I was just cogitating upon the causes of GALAXY 
Science Fiction's phenomenal growth in popularity." 

"And that needs an explanation. Professor?" 

"From a socio-psychological viewpoint, most definitely. To 
what do you attribute the constant increase of interest?" 

"Well . let's try it this way. Professor. Suppose we ask the 
questions and you answer them." 

"So? A bit unusual, but go right ahead." 

"Do you think atomic doom is the only future for mankind?" 

"Not exactly, but the newspapers and the commentators—" 

"Of course. Well, we SHOW other possible futures. Do you 
believe we will be able to leave the Earth?" 

"Eventually, perhaps. But not in our lifetime." 

"We don't agree. Assuming you're right, though, isn't that all 
the more reason to want to know what we'll find on other 
planets. Professor?" 

"I think I see what you mean." 

"Can we achieve immortality?" 

"Ah. Hum. I've often wondered." 

"And travel to different eras in time?" 

"That would be exciting." 

"And you've been trying to discover why GALAXY is growing 
so popular? Every idea we've mentioned— and a lot more, be- 
sides— is treated dramatically and vividly in GALAXY! You really 
live them!" 

"Umm. How do I subscribe? After all, one shouldn't resist a 
trend, should one? Heh, heh!" 

"Just fill out the coupon— or make out your own order and 
send it in. The coupon's for your convenience, not ours. And now 
you'll be one of us!"

PICK 

TT was the New York Times 
Magazine that reported: “In 
case of obligatory metamorphosis 
into an animal, 90 per cent of adult 
male Britons would prefer to be- 
come horses and 97 per cent of 
female Britons would prefer to 
become cats. — Oxford Univer- 
sity” 

No U.S. university being willing 
to poll American preferences, 
Galaxy undertook this vital task. 
Our Interviewer 1001 (we num- 
ber them like checks in a new 
checkbook) was assigned to get 
the Inner Meaning from any pass- 
ing psychiatrist (the object was 
no money). 

His notes follow: 

“Cornered Dr. Ashley Pan- 
tagruel at a party. Read clipping. 
Dr. Pantagruel cornered me. ‘The 
sexual symbolism of horse and cat 
is too well known to bear repeat- 
ing,’ he said, and has been proving 
it for hours. Scotch and bourbon 
ran out; hate gin, but not that 
much. Something re toilet training : 
horses anywhere, cats in catbox. 
Wish I could ask that chartreuse 
girl in the very brainy-looking 
sweater, have to knock him down 
to get by . .” 

The fine for disturbing the 
peace equaling an office visit, we 
dispatched Interviewer 1002 to 
query Dr. Liebfraumilch. His 50 
minutes expired before he could 
get past 100 1’s findings. However, 



ONE 

both exp>ert opinions coincide: the 
preferences of the adult male and 
female Britons were no surprise at 
all to psychiatry. 

Considerably in conflict with 
this definitive analysis are the an- 
swers of the American public. 
Since the Times neglected to state 
how large and representative the 
Oxford sampling was, we settled 
upon 5493 interviews as optimum. 
To hold down expenses, all were 
interviewed within subway dis- 
tance. As with Drs. Pantagruel 
and Liebfraumilch, we revealed 
the Oxford statistics to a control 
group to see whether their prefer- 
ences would be affected. 

TABLE I — MALES 
Cats 97% 

TABLE II — FEMALES 
Horses 90% 

This, of course, is in direct con- 
trast with the Oxford findings. 
Questioned about this (by tele- 
phone), Drs. Pantagruel and Lieb- 
fraumilch stated that it was equal- 
ly predictable in terms of parental 
fixations. We then queried the con- 
trol group, which disagreed in 
varying degrees of emotionalism 
and literacy approximately as fol- 
lows: “Who wants to be a horse 
(cat) when all the dames (guys) 
are cats (horses)?” Dr. Pantag- 
ruel : “That’s what they think.” Dr. 
Liebfraumilch: “That’s what they 
think.” 

We showed the control group 
GALAXY 



2 



its first ballot (we kept nothing 
from them) and obtained a dif- 
ferent response: 

TABLE in — MALES (REV.) 

Horses 97% 

TABLE IV — FEMALES (REV.) 

Cats 90% 

Dr. Pantagruel: “What better 
proof do you need? As I was say- 
ing when we were cut off last time, 
insecurity and guilt as to sex—” 
Dr. Liebfraumilch: “Of course. 
Sexual guilt and insecurity—” 

We would have gone back to 
the control group, but our account- 
ant (cat-horse) objected on the 
grounds that he could not keep on 
interminably working out table re- 
visions, a view shared by our office 
manager (horse-cat) who was fur- 
nishing subway tokens and coins 
for telephones. We had to be satis- 
fied with the statistical prediction 
that, as the horse goes, so goes the 
cat, or vice versa, whether for 
their reasons or the doctors’ being 
left for future researchers to de- 
termine. 

This decision freed Interview- 
ers 1001 and 1002 to aid 1003, 
who had been having rather a 
rough time all by herself with the 
uncontrolled group, and we ob- 
tained these conclusions in pretty 
short order: 

TABLE V— MALES (RAW) 



Horses (draft) 0% 

Horses (race) 1% 

Bulls 1% 

Eagles 97% 



Undecided 1% 

TABLE VI — FEMALES (RAW) 
Cats (alley) 0% 

Cats (pedigree) 9% 

Mink 9% 

Swans 90% 

Undecided 1% 



In females (raw), the seeming 
error of 9% is caused by all in- 
sisting on being both cats and fur- 
bearing animals; the latter is listed 
as a single item, since the furs are 
about equal, statistically speaking, 
in retail value. 

Another false deduction (bird- 
breeding) may be made from the 
fact that male preference was 97% 
eagles and female 90% swans. 
Actually, it is as insoluble as the 
English dilemma — eagles and 
swans have as little in common 
romantically as horses and cats. 

The “Undecided” sub-groups 
showed some anomalous reactions 
that are worthy of note: 

Daisy Rose Dahlia, housewife: 
“Can’t one be a flower?” 

B.B.D. Osborne, tycoon: “You 
pick it — anything at all — I’m late 
for an appointment.” 

Hathaway Peterson, biology in- 
structor: “Procreation aside, it’s sci- 
entifically untenable. How would 
it be done?” 

John Dole, retired: “Congress’ll 
never pass it!” 

Alonzo Lophauser, swami: “Go 
through all those incarnations 
again?”

Beginning A 4-Part Serial 



If stands to reason that the last thing a man 
can bungle is his own death . but not Blaine; 
he had some finished business yet to unfinishi 

Illustrated by WOOD

GALAXY 




I 

A fterward, Thomas 

Blaine thought about the 
manner of his dying and 
wished it had been more interest- 
ing. 

Why couldn’t his death have 
come while he was battling a ty- 
phoon, meeting a tiger’s charge, or 
climbing a windswept mountain? 
Why had his death been so tame, 
so commonplace, so ordinary? 

But an enterprising death, he 
realized, would have been out of 
character for him. Undoubtedly he 
was meant to die in just the quick, 
common, messy, painless way he 
did. And all his life must have 
gone into the forming and shap- 
ing of that death — a vague indi- 
cation in childhood, a fair promise 
in his college years, an implacable 
certainty at the age of thirty-two. 

Still, no matter how common- 
place, one’s death is the most cli- 
mactic event of one’s life. Blaine 
thought about his with intense 
curiosity. He had to know about 
those last precious moments when 
his own particular death lay wait- 
ing for him on a dark New Jersey 
highway. 

Had there been some warning 
sign, some portent? What had he 
done, or not done? What had he 
been thinking? 

Those final seconds were cru- 
cial to him. 

How, exactly, had he died? 



TIME KILLER 



5 



TTE had been driving over a 
straight, empty white high- 
way, his headlights probing ahead, 
the darkness receding endlessly 
before him. His speedometer read 
seventy-five. It felt like forty. Far 
down the road, he saw headlights 
approaching, the first in hours. 

Blaine was returning to New 
York after a week’s vacation at 
his cabin on Chesapeake Bay. He 
had fished and swum and dozed 
in the sun on the rough planks of 
his dock. One day he sailed his 
sloop to Oxford and attended a 
dance at the yacht club that night. 
He met a silly, pert-nosed girl in a 
blue dress who told him he looked 
like a South Seas adventurer, so 
tanned and tall in his khakis. He 
sailed back to his cabin the next 
day, to doze in the sun and dream 
of giving up everything, loading his 
sailboat with canned goods and 
heading for Tahiti. Ah, Raiatea, 
the mountains of Moqrea, the fresh 
trade wind . 

But a continent and an ocean 
lay between him and Tahiti, and 
other obstacles besides. The 
thought was only for an hour’s 
dreaming and definitely not to be 
acted upon. Now he was returning 
to New York, to his job as a 
junior yacht designer for the fa- 
mous old firm of Mattison & 
Peters. 

The other car’s headlights were 
drawing near. Blaine slowed to 
sixty. 



In spite of his title, there were 
few yachts for Blaine to design. 
Old Tom Mattison took care of 
the conventional cruising boats. 
His brother Rolf, known as the 
Wizard of Mystic, had an interna- 
tional reputation for his ocean-rac- 
ing sailboats and fast one-designs. 
So what was there for a junior 
yacht designer to do? 

Blaine drew layouts and deck 
plans, and handled p>romotion, ad- 
vertising and publicity. It was 
responsible work and not without 
its satisfactions. But it was not 
yacht designing. 

He knew he should strike out 
on his own. But there were so 
many yacht designers, so few cus- 
tomers. As he had told Laura, it 
was rather like designing arbalests, 
catapults and matchlocks. Inter- 
esting creative work, but who 
would buy your products? 

“You could find a market for 
your sailboats,” she had told him, 
distressingly direct. 

He had grinned. “Action isn’t 
my forte. I’m an expert on con- 
templation and mild regret.” 

“You mean you’re lazy.” 

“Not at all. That’s like saying 
that a hawk doesn’t gallop well, or 
a horse has poor soaring ability. 
You can’t compare different spe- 
cies. I’m just not the go-getter 
type of human. For me, dreams, 
reveries, visions, and plans meant 
only for contemplation, never for 
execution.”

“I hate to hear you talk like 
that,” she said snappishly. 

T>LAINE had been lasting it on 
” a bit thick, of course. But 
there was a lot of truth in it. He 
had a pleasant job, an adequate 
salary, a secure position. He had 
an apartment in Greenwich Vil- 
lage, a hi-h, a car, a small cabin on 
Chesapeake Bay, a fine sloop, and 
the affection of Laura and several 
other girls. Perhaps, as Laura 
somewhat tritely expressed it, he 
was caught in an eddy on the 
current of life . But so what? 
You could observe the scenery bet- 
ter from a gently revolving eddy. 

The other car’s headlights were 
very near. Blaine noticed, with a 
sense of shock, that he had in- 
creased speed to eighty miles an 
hour. 

He let up on the accelerator. 
His car swerved freakishly, vio- 
lently, toward the oncoming head- 
lights. 

Blowout? Steering failure? He 
twisted hard on the steering wheel. 
It wouldn’t turn. His car struck 
the low concrete separation be- 
tween north and south lanes, and 
bounded high into the air. The 
steering wheel spun in his hands 
and the engine wailed like a lost 
soul. 

The other car was trying to 
swerve, too late. They were going 
to meet nearly head-on. 

And Blaine thought. Yes, I’m 



one of them. I’m one of those silly 
asses you read about whose cars 
go out of control and kill inno- 
cent people. Modem cars and 
modem roads and higher speeds 
and the same old sloppy reflexes. 

Suddenly, unaccountably, the 
steering wheel was working again, 
a razor’s edge reprieve. Blaine 
ignored it. As the other car’s head- 
lights glared across his windshield, 
his mood suddenly changed from 
regret to exultance. For a moment, 
he welcomed the smash, lusted for 
it, and for pain, destmction, cmelty 
and death. 

Then the cars came together. 
The feeling of exultance faded 
as quickly as it had come. Blaine 
felt a profound regret for all he 
had left imdone, the waters un- 
sailed, movies unseen, books un- 
read, girls untouched. He was 
thrown forward. The steering 
wheel broke off in his hands. The 
steering column speared him 
through the chest and broke his 
spine as his head drove through 
the thick safety glass. 

An instant later, he was quick- 
ly, commonly, messily, painlessly 
dead. 

II 

TTE awoke in a white bed in a 
white room. 

“He’s alive now,” someone said. 

Blaine opened his eyes. Two 
men were standing over him. One 



TIME KILLER

was an ugly, red-faced man dressed 
in white, who appeared to be a 
doctor. The other was a tiny, bald, 
spiderlike old man with a peering, 
animated monkeylike face. 

“How do you feel?” the doctor 
asked. 

“All right, I guess,” Blaine said. 

“Do you see?” the doctor said, 
turning to the spiderlike old man. 
“He’s perfectly sane, Mr. Reilly.” 

“Hmm,” said Reilly. 

“Yes, sir,” the doctor said. “The 
death trauma has been overrated. 
Grossly overrated, as my forth- 
coming book will prove.” 

Reilly nodded impatiently. 
“Well, let’s get started with the 
recording.” 

He and the doctor walked away. 
Blaine watched them go, wonder- 
ing what they had been talking 
about. A fat and motherly nurse 
came to his bedside. “How do you 
feel?” she asked. 

“Fine,” said Blaine. “But I’d 
like to know—” 

“Sorry,” the nurse said, “no ques- 
tions yet; doctor’s orders. Drink 
this, it’ll pep you up. That’s a 
good boy. Don’t worry, every- 
thing’s going to be all right.” 

She left. Her reassuring words 
frightened him. What did she 
mean, everything’s going to be all 
right? That meant something was 
wrong! What was it, what was 
wrong? What was he doing here, 
what had happened? 

The doctor and Mr. Reilly re- 



turned, accompanied by a young 
woman. 

“Is he all right. Doctor?” the 
young woman asked. 

“Perfectly sane,” the red-faced 
doctor said. “I’d call it a good fit.” 

“Then I can begin the record- 
ing?” 

“Certainly, Miss Thorne, though 
I cannot guarantee his behavior. 
The death trauma, though grossly 
overrated, is still capable of—” 

“All right, Marie— begin,” Reilly 
said, in a voice that showed who 
was boss. 

“Yes, sir,” the girl said. 

QHE walked across to Blaine 
and bent over him. She was 
a very pretty girl, Blaine noticed. 
Her features were clean-cut, her 
skin fresh and glowing. She had 
long, gleaming brown hair pulled 
too tightly back over her small 
ears, and there was a faint hint of 
perfume about her. She should 
have been beautiful, but she was 
marred by the immobility of her 
features, the controlled tenseness 
of her slender body. It was hard 
to imagine her laughing or crying. 
It was impossible to imagine her 
in bed. There was something of 
the fanatic about her, something 
of the dedicated revolutionary; but 
he suspected that her cause was 
herself. 

“Where do you think you are?” 
she asked. 

“Looks like a hospital. I sup-

GALAXY 



pose—” He stopped. He had just 
noticed a small microphone in her 
hand. 

“Yes, what do you suppose?” 

She made a small gesture. Men 
came forward and wheeled heavy 
equipment around his bed. 

“Go right ahead,” Marie Thorne 
said. “Tell us.” 

“To hell with that,” Blaine said 
moodily, watching the men set up 
their machines around him. “What 
is this? What’s going on?” 

“We’re trying to help you,” said 
Marie Thorne. “Won’t you co- 
operate?” 

Blaine nodded, wishing she 
would smile. He felt suddenly very 
unsure of himself. Had something 
happened to him? 

“Do you remember the acci- 
dent?” she asked. 

“What accident?” 

“Do you remember being hurt?” 

Blaine shuddered as his memory 
returned in a rush of spinning 
lights, wailing engine, impact and 
breakage. 

“Yes. The steering wheel broke. 
I got it through the chest. Then 
my head hit.” 

“Look at your chest,” she said. 

Blaine looked. His chest, be- 
neath white pajamas, was un- 
marked. 

“Impossible!” he cried. His own 
voice sounded hollow, distant, un- 
real. He was aware of the men 
around his bed talking as they bent 
over their machines, but they 



seemed like shadows, flat and 
without substance. Their thin, un- 
important voices were like flies 
buzzing against a window. The 
red-faced doctor smiled dully, and 
spiderlike old Reilly tapped his 
foot and looked impatient. 

“Nice first reaction.” 

“Very nice indeed.” 

Marie Thorne said to him, “You 
are unhurt.” 

13LAINE looked at his undam- 
aged body and remembered 
the accident. “I can’t believe it!” 
“He’s coming on perfectly.” 
“Fine mixture of belief and in- 
credulity.” 

Marie Thorne said, “Quiet, 
please. Go ahead.” 

“I remember the accident,” 
Blaine said. “I remember the 
smashing. I remember— dying.” 
“Get that?” 

“Hell, yes. It really plays!” 
“Perfectly spontaneous scene.” 
“Marvelous! They’ll go wild 
over it!” 

She said, “A little less noise, 
please. Then you remember dy- 
ing?” 

“Yes, yes, I died!” 

“His face!” 

“That ludicrous expression 
heightens the reality.” 

She said, “Look carefully at 
your body. Here’s a mirror. 
Examine your face.” 

Blaine looked, and shivered like 
a man in fever. He touched the 



TIME KILLER 



9 



mirror, then ran shaking fingers 
over his face. 

“It isn’t my face! Where’s my 
face? Where did you put my body 
and face?” 

He was in a nightmare from 
which he could never awaken. 
Reilly and the ugly doctor watched 
him. The flat shadow men sur- 
rounded him, their voices buzzing 
like flies against a window, tend- 
ing their cardboard machines, 
filled with vague menace, yet 
strangely indifferent, almost un- 
aware of him. Marie Thorne bent 
low over him with her tight, pretty 
face, and from her small red mouth 
came gentle nightmare words. 

“Your body is dead, killed in 
an automobile accident. You can 
remember its dying. But we man- 
aged to save the part of you that 
really counts. We saved your mind 
and have given you a new body 
for it here, in what you would call 
the future.” 

Blaine opjened his mouth to 
scream, and closed it again. “It’s 
unbelievable,” he said instead. 
And the flies buzzed. 
“Understatement.” 

“Well, of course. One can’t be 
frenetic forever!’ 

“I expected a little more 
scenery-chewing.” 

“Wrongly. Understatement 
rather accentuates his dilemma.” 
“Perhaps, in pure stage terms. 
But consider the thing realistical- 
ly. This poor guy has just dis- 



covered that he died in an auto- 
mobile accident and is now reborn 
in a new body. So what does he 
say about it? He says, ‘Ifs unbe- 
lievable! Damn it, he’s not really 
reacting to the shock!” 

“He is! Yot/re projecting!” 
Blaine, deep in his nightmare, 
was hardly aware of the soft, buz- 
zing voices. He asked, “Did I real- 
ly die?” 

She nodded. 

“And am I really born again in 
a different body?” 

She nodded again, waiting. 
Blaine looked at her, and at 
the shadow men tending their 
cardboard machines. Why were 
they bothering him? Why couldn’t 
they go pick on some other dead 
man? Corpses shouldn’t be forced 
to answer questions. Death was 
Man’s ancient privilege, his im- 
memorial pact with life, granted to 
the slave as well as the noble. 
Death was Man’s solace and his 
right. But perhaps they had re- 
voked that right and now you 
couldn’t evade your responsibili- 
ties simply by being dead. 

^^HEY were waiting for him to 
speak. And Blaine wondered if 
insanity still retained its heredi- 
tary privileges. With ease, he could 
slip over and find out. 

But insanity is not granted to 
everyone. Blaine’s self-control re- 
turned. He looked up at Marie 
Thome.

“My feelings,” he said slowly, 
“are difficult to describe. I’ve died, 
and now I’m contemplating the 
fact. I don’t suppose any man 
fully believes—” 

“Lets cut it right here. He’s get- 
ting analytical.” 

“I think you’re right,” Marie 
Thorne said. She bent low over 
Blaine. “Tell me your name.” 
“Thomas Blaine.” 

“What?” 

All noise in the room stopped. 
The men tending the recording 
machines were deathly silent. Mr. 
Reilly stepped forward, and the 
doctor watched him anxiously. 

“What did you say your name 
was?” Reilly asked. 

“Blaine. Thomas Blaine.” 
“Age?” 

“Thirty-two.” 

“Marital status?” 

“Single.” 

“Are you sure?” Reilly insisted. 
“Are you sure that your name is 
Blaine?” 

“Absolutely certain,” Blaine an- 
swered. “What is—” 

Reilly’s mouth twisted. He con- 
trolled himself with an effort and 
asked, “What do you remember 
about the Threshold?” 

“The what?” 

“The Threshold!” Reilly roared. 
“Tell me about it!” 

“I don’t remember an 5 dhing,” 
Blaine said. 

“You must! You were in the 
Threshold for 158 years, until we 



pulled you into this body! You 
must remember! Tell me what it 
was like!” 

“I don’t know what you’re talk- 
ing about,” Blaine said firmly. 

The spidery old man stared at 
him. He asked again, “What is 
your name?” 

“Blaine.” 

“He’s the wrong man!” Reilly 
screamed. “Don’t you fools see it? 
Wrong, all wrong, everything 
wrong!” 

The doctor moved to Reill 5 r’s 
side, trying to calm him. But the 
old man thrust him aside and 
glared down at Blaine. 

“You’re the wrong man!” Reilly 
shouted. “And you don’t remem- 
ber the Threshold! Why, damn 
you, you’ve no right in that body, 
no right at all! It wasn’t meant for 
you, you useless interloper! The 
whole experiment’s a failure and 
you’ve stolen a good, exf>ensive 
body. Thief! I’ll rip the life out of 
you with my two hands!” 

"OEILLY was hysterical with 
anger. His thin, long-nailed 
hands reached for Blaine’s throat. 
Marie Thorne and the doctor 
pulled him back. In a moment, 
Reilly recovered and began to 
tremble violently. 

“Sir,” the doctor said to him, 
“your body is not functioning 
properly. At best, it is not allowing 
you to think well. At worst, it can’t 
withstand shocks like these. Under

the circumstances, I must insist 
that you take an immediate rein- 
carnation.” 

“No . Reilly said feebly. 
“Yes,” the doctor said. “You 
must reincarnate, sir, while you’re 
still able. But first, some rest.” 
He led the old man away. The 
technicians, solid and mundane 
now, their vague menace disap- 
peared, began rolling away their 
equipment. 

“Darn good while it lasted.” 

“A collector’s item.” 

“Shame it’ll never be released.” 
“Wait!” Blaine cried. “I don’t 
understand. Where am I? What 
happened? How—” 

“I’ll explain everything later,” 
Marie Thorne said. “I’m terribly 
sorry, things have gone wrong. I 
have to help arrange Mr. Reilly’s 
reincarnation.” 

The men and equipment were 
gone. Marie Thorne smiled reas- 
suringly and hurried away. 

Blaine felt ridiculously close to 
tears. He blinked rapidly when the 
fat and motherly nurse came back. 

“Drink this,” said the nurse. “It’ll 
make you sleep. That’s it, take it 
all down like a good boy. Just re- 
lax, you had a big day, what with 
dying and being reborn and all.” 
Two big tears rolled down 
Blaine’s cheeks. 

“Dear me,” said the nurse, “the 
cameras should be here now. 
Those are genuine spontaneous 
tears if I ever saw any. Many a 



tragic and spontaneous scene I’ve 
witnessed in this infirmary, believe 
me, and I could tell those snooty 
recording boys something about 
genuine emotion if I wanted to, 
and they thinking they know all 
the secrets of the human heart.” 
“Where am I?” Blaine asked 
drowsily. “Where is this?” 

“This is the Rex Corporation,” 
the nurse said. “We’re in the life- 
after-death business.” 

“Oh,” said Blaine. 

Then he was asleep. 

Ill 

A FTER many hours, he awoke 
calm and rested. He looked 
at the white bed and white room, 
and remembered. 

He had been killed in an ac- 
cident and reborn in the future. 
There had been a doctor who con- 
sidered the death trauma over- 
rated, and men who recorded his 
spontaneous reaction and de- 
clared them a collector’s item, 
and a pretty girl whose features 
showed a lamentable lack of emo- 
tion, and a nurse who spoke of the 
life-after-death business. 

Blaine yawned and stretched. 
Dead. Dead at thirty-two. A pity, 
he thought, that this young life 
was snuffed in its prime. He’d 
been a good sort, really, and quite 
promising . 

But that was no way to feel. 
Yesterday, he reminded himself 



12 



GALAXY 



firmly, he was a yacht designer 
driving back from Maryland. To- 
day he was a man reborn into the 
future. 

The future! Reborn! 

The words lacked impact. He 
had already grown used to the 
idea. One grows used to anything, 
he thought, even to one’s death. 
Especially to one’s death. If you 
chopped off a man’s head three 
times a day for twenty years, he’d 
grow used to it, and probably cry 
like a baby if you stopped . 

He didn’t care to pursue that 
train of thought any further. 

He thought about Laura. Would 
she weep for him? Would she get 
drunk? Or would she just feel 
mildly depressed at the news, and 
take a tranquilizer for it? What 
about Jane and Miriam? Would 
they even hear about his death? 
Probably not. Months later, they 
might wonder why he never called 
any more. 

NOUGH of that. All that was 
past. Now he was in the future. 

He remembered magazine ar- 
ticles and stories he had read. To- 
day there might be free atomic 
power, undersea farming, world 
peace, universal birth regulation, 
interplanetary travel, free love, 
brotherhood of mankind, a cure 
for all diseases, and a planned so- 
ciety in which men breathed deep 
the air of freedom. 

That’s what there should be. 



Blaine thought. But there were less 
pleasant possibilities. Perhaps a 
grim-faced Oligarch had Earth in 
his iron grasp, while a dedicated 
underground struggled toward 
freedom. Or small, gelatinous alien 
creatures with outlandish names 
might have enslaved the human 
race. Perhaps a new and horrible 
disease marched unchecked across 
the land, or p)ossibly the Earth, 
swept of all culture by hydrogen 
warfare, fought painfully back to 
technological civilization while hu- 
man wolfpacks roamed the bad- 
lands; or a million other equally 
dismal things could have hap- 
pened. 

And yet, Blaine thought, man- 
kind showed a historic ability to 
avoid the extremes of doom as 
well as the extremes of bliss. Chaos 
was forever predicted and utopia 
was continually seen just ahead. 
And neither came to pass. 

Accordingly, Blaine expected 
that this future would show certain 
definite improvements over the 
past, but he expected some de- 
teriorations as well; some old prob- 
lems would be gone, but certain 
others would have taken their 
places. 

“In short,” Blaine said to him- 
self, “I expect that this future will 
be like all futures in comparison 
with their pasts. That’s not very 
specific, but then I’m not in the 
predicting or the prophesying 
business.”

¥TIS thoughts were interrupted 
by Marie Thorne walking 
briskly into the room. 

“Good morning,” she said. “How 
do you feel?” 

“Like a new man.” 

“Good. Would you sign this, 
please?” She held out a p>en and 
a typed paper. 

“You’re very damned efficient,” 
said Blaine. “What am I signing?” 
“Read it,” she said. “It’s a re- 
lease absolving us from any legal 
responsibility in saving your life.” 
“Eh?” 

“We saved you. But it’s against 
the law to save lives without the 
potential victim’s written consent. 
There wasn’t opportunity for the 
Rex Corporation lawyers to obtain 
your consent beforehand. So we’d 
like to protect ourselves now.” 
“What is the Rex Corp>oration?” 
“We’re affiliated with the Here- 
after Corporation,” she said. “Our 
outfit is as well known today as 
Flyier-Thiess was in your time.” 
“Who’s Flyier-Thiess?” 

“No? Ford, then?” 

“Yeah, Ford. So the Rex Cor- 
poration is as well known as Ford. 
What does it do?” 

“It manufactures Rex Power 
Systems,” she said, “which are 
used to F>ower spaceships, reincar- 
nation machines, hereafter drivers, 
and the like. It was a development 
of the Rex Power Systems that 
snatched you from your car at 
the moment after death and 



brought you into the future. The 
trouble is, you aren’t the man we 
were trying to save.” 

“Who were you trying to save?” 
“A religious leader of your time. 
We wanted him to endorse our 
product.” 

Blaine looked puzzled. 

1V|' ARIE Thorne went on. 

“We’re in the scientific after- 
life business,” she told him. ‘We 
can guarantee a life after death. 
But the organized religions don’t 
like our form of salvation. They 
boycott us. Their adherents form 
a large potential market for our 
product. If we could get the en- 
dorsement of a progressive relig- 
ious leader, it would help break 
down the sales resistance.” 

“What happened to the man 
you tried to save?” Blaine asked. 

“That’s what we’d like to know,” 
Marie said. “You appeared in his 
place. It was very startling.” 

“I can imagine,” said Blaine. 
“But what is this scientific here- 
after? How does it work?” 

“Would you mind signing the 
release?” 

The paper stated that he, 
Thomas Blaine, agreed not to bring 
suit against the Rex Corporation 
for their unauthorized saving of 
his life in the year 1958 and the 
subsequent transporting of that life 
to a host body in New York in the 
year 2110. 

Blaine signed. “Now,” he said.

“about this scientific hereafter—” 
“There isn’t time,” Marie told 
him. “It works. Just take my word 
for it. You’ll see a part of the 
process almost immediately.” 

“I will?” 

“Yes. Mr. Reilly is going to un- 
dertake an immediate reincarna- 
tion. He’s been putting it off, try- 
ing to find a really suitable body. 
But his own body is deteriorating 
fast. His doctor advises reincarna- 
tion at once, and his grandfather 
is insisting on it.” 

“Reilly’s grandfather? How old 
is he?” 

“He was eighty-one when he 
died.” 

“What?” 

“Yes, he died about sixty years 
ago. Reilly’s father is dead, too, 
but he didn’t stay in the Threshold, 
which is a pity because he had 
excellent business sense. An extra 
advisory ghost is always useful. 
Why are you staring at me, 
Blaine? Oh, I forgot, you don’t 
know the setup. It’s very simple, 
really. You’ll pick it up as you go 
along.” 

“I hope so,” Blaine said. 

“Of course you will. The nurse 
will bring you some clothes. Please 
dress at once. Mr. Reilly wants to 
make you a business offer before 
he undertakes his reincarnation.” 
“What kind of an offer?” 

“I’d better let him tell you him- 
self,” Marie Thome said, and 
briskly left the room. 



^ I ^HE nurse brought him lunch 
on a tray. The bearded doctor 
came in, examined him and de- 
clared him perfectly fit There was 
not the slightest trace of rebirth 
depression, he declared, and the 
death trauma was obviously over- 
rated. No reason why Blaine 
shouldn’t be up and about 

The nurse came back with cloth- 
ing, a blue shirt, brown slacks, and 
soft, bulbous gray shoes. The out- 
fit, she assured him, was quite con- 
servative. 

Blaine ate with good appetite. 
But before dressing, he examined 
his new body in the full-length 
bathroom mirror. It was the first 
chance he’d had for a careful ap- 
praisal. 

His former body had been tall 
and lean, with straight black hair 
and a good-humored boyish face. 
In thirty-two years, he had grown 
used to that quick, deft, easy- 
moving body. With good grace, he 
had accepted its constitutional 
flaws, its occasional illnesses, and 
had glorified them into virtues, 
into unique properties of the per- 
sonality that resided within them. 
For his body’s limitations, far more 
than its capabilities, seemed to ex- 
press his own particular essence. 

He had been fond of that body. 

His new body was a shock. 

It was heavily muscled, barrel- 
chested, broad-shouldered. It felt 



TIME KILLER 



15 



top-heavy, for the legs were a little 
short in proportion to the hercu- 
lean torso. His hands were large 
and calloused. Blaine made a fist 
and gazed at it respectfully. He 
could probably fell an ox with a 
single blow, if an ox were pro- 
curable. 

His face was square and bold, 
with a prominent jaw, wide cheek- 
bones and a Roman nose. His hair 
was blond and curly. His eyes 
were a steely blue. It was a some- 
what handsome, slightly brutal 
face. 

“I don’t like it,” Blaine said 
emphatically. “And I hate curly 
blond hair.” 

His new body had considerable 
physical strength, but he had al- 
ways disliked sheer physical 
strength. The body looked clumsy, 
graceless, difficult to manage. It 
was the kind of body that bumped 
into chairs and stepped on people’s 
toes, shook hands too vigorously, 
talked too loudly and sweated pro- 
fusely. Clothes would always bulge 
and constrict this body. It would 
need continual hard exercise to 
keep in shape, and Blaine detested 
exercise. Perhaps he would even 
have to diet; the body looked as 
though it had a slight tendency 
toward fat. 

physical strength is all 
very well,” Blaine told 
himself, “if one has a purpose for 
it. Otherwise it’s just a nuisance 



and a distraction, like trawling 
equipment on a racing yacht.” 

The body was bad enough, but 
the face was worse. Blaine had 
never liked strong, harsh, rough- 
hewn faces. They were fine for 
sandhogs, army sergeants, jungle 
explorers and the like, but not 
for a man who enjoyed cultured 
society. Such a face was obviously 
incapable of subtlety of expression. 
All nuance, the delicate interplay 
of line and plane, would be lost. 
With this face, you could grin or 
frown; only gross emotions would 
show. 

Experimentally, he smiled boy- 
ishly at the mirror. The result was 
a satyr’s leer. 

“I’ve been gypped,” Blaine said 
bitterly. 

It was apparent to him that the 
qualities of his present mind and 
his new body were opposed. Co- 
operation between them seemed 
impossible. Of course, his person- 
ality might reshape his body; on 
the other hand, his body might 
have some demands to make on 
his {personality. 

“We’ll see,” Blaine told his 
formidable body, “who’s boss.” 

On his left shoulder was a long, 
jagged scar. He wondered how the 
body had received so grievous a 
wound. Then he began wondering 
where the body’s real owner was. 
Could he still be lodged in the 
brain, lying doggo, waiting a chance 
to take over?

Speculation was useless. Later, 
perhaps, Blaine would find out. He 
took a final look at himself in the 
mirror. 

He didn’t like what he saw. He 
was afraid he never would. 

“Well,” Blaine said at last, 
“dead men can’t be choosers.” 

He turned from the mirror and 
began dressing. Later, Marie 
Thorne came and took him to 
Mr. Reilly’s tower apartment. 

lY/l" R. Reilly sat erect and al- 
most lost in a great, soft, 
thronelike chair. His wrinkled 
translucent skin was stretched 
tight across his skull and clawed 
hands, and bone and tendon 
showed clearly through the 
leathery, shrunken flesh. Blaine 
had the impression of blood cours- 
ing sluggishly through the brittle, 
purple varicosed veins, threaten- 
ing momentarily to stop. Yet 
Reilly’s posture was firm and his 
eyes were lucid in his humorous 
monkey face. 

“Please be seated, sir,” Mr. Reil- 
ly said. “You too. Miss Thorne. 
I was just discussing you with my 
grandfather, Mr. Blaine.” 

Blaine glanced around, almost 
expecting to see the sixty-years- 
dead grandfather looming spec- 
trally over him. But there was no 
sign of him in the ornate, high- 
ceilinged room. 

“He’s gone now,” Mr. Reilly ex- 
plained. “Poor Grandfather can 



maintain an ectoplasmic state for 
only a brief time. But even so, 
he’s better off than most ghosts. 
He tells me I must begin my 
reincarnation immediately.” 

“And are you?” Blaine asked. 
“Of course. Ghosts generally 
have the power of viewing the 
future, you know. I could hardly 
go against his advice.” 

Blaine’s expression must have 
changed, for Reilly asked, “Don’t 
you believe in ghosts, Mr. Blaine?” 
“I’m afraid I don’t.” 

“Of course not. I suppose the 
word has unfortunate connotations 
for your twentieth-century mind. 
Clanking chains, skeletons, all that 
nonsense. But words change their 
meaning, and even reality is al- 
tered as mankind alters and ma- 
nipulates nature.” 

“I see,” Blaine said politely. 
“You consider that doubletalk,” 
Mr. Reilly said good-naturedly. 
“It wasn’t meant to be. Consider 
the manner in which words change 
their meaning. In the twentieth 
century, ‘atoms’ became a catch- 
all word for imaginative writers 
with their ‘atom guns’ and ‘atom- 
powered ships.’ An absurd word, 
which any level-headed man 
would do well to ignore, just as 
you level-headedly ignore ‘ghosts.’ 
Yet a few years later, ‘atoms’ con- 
jured a picture of very real and 
imminent doom. No level-headed 
man could continue to ignore the 
word!”

R eilly smiled reminiscently. 

“ ‘Radiation’ changed from a 
dull textbook term to a source of 
cancerous ulcers. ‘Space-sickness’ 
was an abstract and unloaded term 
in your time. But in fifty years 
it meant hospitals filled with 
twisted bodies. Words tend to 
change, Mr. Blaine, from an ab- 
stract, fanciful, or academic use 
to a functional, realistic, everyday 
use. It happ>ens when manipula- 
tion catches up with theory.” 
“And ghosts?” 

“The process has been similar. 
Mr. Blaine, you’ll simply have to 
change your concept of the word.” 
“It’ll be difficult,” Blaine said. 
“But necessary. Remember, 
there was always a lot of evidence 
in their favor. The prognosis for 
their existence, you might say, was 
favorable. And when life after 
death became fact instead of wish- 
ful thinking, ghosts became fact.” 
“I think I’ll have to see one 
first,” Blaine said. 

“Undoubtedly you will. But let’s 
get down to business. Frankly, Mr. 
Blaine, your presence here is some- 
thing of an embarrassment to us.” 
“I regret that.” 

“It wasn’t your fault, of course. 
But look at the position we’re in. 
We set up an expensive experi- 
ment and buy a costly host body. 
We expect to snatch a progressive 
cleric from your time to use in 
our campaign to sell the organized 
religions.” 



“I guess I won’t be much help 
there,” Blaine said. 

“No. And what’s worse, you 
bring us no information about the 
Threshold.” 

“What’s the Threshold?” 

“It is the interface region be- 
tween Earth and the hereafter, 
through which you passed on your 
way here. We expected valuable 
data about the Threshold. But you 
have no recollection of it. None 
at all! The religions could use that 
fact against us, Blaine, if it ever 
leaked out” 

“Look,” Blaine said, “I’m grate- 
ful to you people for saving my 
life, even if you did it accidental- 
ly. You certainly don’t think Fm 
going to spill your secrets, do 
you?” 

“Mistakes can happen,” Reilly 
pointed out. “Accidents can oc- 
cur. You might change your mind. 
No, Mr. Blaine, you should not 
be here in 2110, a walking proof 
of bad judgment. Therefore, sir, 
I’d like to make a proposition.” 
“I’m listening,” Blaine said. 
“Suppose Rex buys you here- 
after insurance, thus ensuring your 
life after death — would you con- 
sent to suicide?” 

Blaine blinked rapidly, stunned. 
“No. Certainly not” 

“Why not?” Reilly asked. 

OR a moment the reason 
■*- seemed self-evident. What 
creature consents to take its own

life? Unhappily, Man does. So 
Blaine had to stop and sort his 
thoughts. 

“First of all,” he said, “I’m not 
fully convinced about this here- 
after.” 

“Suppose we convince you,” Mr. 
Reilly said. “Would you commit 
suicide then?” 

“No!” 

“But how shortsighted! Mr. 
Blaine, consider your position. 
This age is alien to you, inimical, 
unsatisfactory. What kind of work 
can you do? Who can you talk 
with, and about what? You can’t 
even walk the streets without be- 
ing in deadly peril of your life.” 

’LL find out how things work 

* here,” Blaine said. 

“But you can never really know, 
never understand! You’re in the 
same position a caveman would 
be, thrown haphazardly into your 
own 1958. He’d think himself ca- 
pable enough, I suppose, on the 
basis of his experience with saber- 
tooth tigers and hairy mastodons. 
Perhaps some kind soul would 
even warn him about gangsters. 
But what good would it do? 
Would it save him from being run 
over by a car, electrocuted on a 
subway track, asphyxiated by a 
gas stove, falling through an eleva- 
tor shaft, cut to pieces on a power 
saw, or breaking his neck in the 
bathtub.” 

“You have to be born to those 



things in order to walk unscathed 
among them, Mr. Blaine. And 
even so, these things happened to 
people in your age when they re- 
laxed their attention for a mo- 
ment! How much more likely 
would our caveman be to 
stumble?” 

“You’re exaggerating the situa- 
tion,” Blaine said, feeling a light 
p>erspiration form on his forehead. 

“Am I? The dangers of the 
forest are as nothing to the dan- 
gers of the city. And when the city 
becomes a super-city—” 

“I won’t commit suicide,” Blaine 
declared. “I’ll take my chances. 
Let’s drop the subject.” 

“Why can’t you be reasonable?” 
Mr. Reilly demanded in annoy- 
ance. “Kill yourself now and save 
us all a lot of trouble. I can out- 
line your future for you if you 
don’t. Perhaps, by sheer nerve and 
animal cunning, you’ll survive for 
a year. Even two. It won’t mat- 
ter, in the end it’s suicide any- 
how. You’re a suicide type. Suicide 
is written all over you— you were 
born for it, Blaine! You’ll kill 
yourself wretchedly in a year or 
two, slip out of your maimed flesh 
with relief— but with no hereafter 
to welcome your tired mind.” 
“You’re crazy!” Blaine pro- 
tested. 

“I’m never wrong about suicide 
types,” Mr. Reilly said obstinate- 
ly. “I can always spot them. 
Grandfather agrees with me, and

he’s never wrong. So if you’ll 
only—” 

“No,” Blaine said. “I won’t kill 
myself. I’m afraid you’ll have to 
hire it done.” 

“That’s not my way,” said Mr. 
Reilly. “I won’t coerce you. But 
come to my reincarnation today. 
Get a glimpse of the hereafter. 
Perhaps you’ll change your mind.” 

Blaine hesitated, and the old 
man grinned at him. 

“No danger, I promise you, 
and no tricks! Did you fear I might 
steal your body? I selected a bet- 
ter host months ago from the open 
market. Frankly, I wouldn’t have 
your body. You see, I wouldn’t be 
comfortable in anything so gross.” 

The interview was over. Marie 
Thorne led Blaine out. 

V 

HE reincarnation room was ar- 
ranged like a small theater. It 
was often used, Blaine learned, 
for company lectures and educa- 
tional programs on an executive 
level. Today the audience had 
been kept small and select. The 
Rex board of directors was pres- 
ent, five middle-aged men sitting 
in the back row and talking quiet- 
ly among themselves. Near them 
was a recording secretary. A gov- 
ernment observer was present as 
required by law, and there was a 
gaunt man with a hat pulled low 
over his face. This man, Marie 



explained, was a zombie repre- 
sentative. 

Blaine and Marie sat in front, 
as far from the directors as pos- 
sible. 

On the raised stage, under white 
floodlights, the reincarnation ap>- 
paratus was already in place. 
There were two sturdy armchairs 
equipped with straps and wires. 
Between the chairs was a large 
glossy black machine. Thick wires 
connected the machine to the 
chair, and gave Blaine the un- 
easy feeling that he was going to 
witness an execution. Several tech- 
nicians were bent over the ma- 
chine, making final adjustments. 
Standing near them was the red- 
faced doctor. 

Mr. Reilly came on the stage, 
nodded to the audience and sat 
down in one of the chairs. He was 
followed by a man in his forties 
with a frightened, pale, determined 
face. This was the host, the present 
possessor of the body that Mr. 
Reilly had contracted for. The 
host sat down in the other chair, 
glanced quickly at the audience 
and looked down at his hands. 
He seemed embarrassed. Sweat 
beaded his upper lip, and the arm- 
pits of his jacket were stained 
black. He didn’t look at Reilly, 
nor did Reilly look at him. 

Another man came on the stage, 
bald and earnest-looking, wearing 
a dark suit with a cleric’s collar 
and carrying a little black book.

He began a whispered conversa- 
tion with the two seated men. 

“Brother James,” Marie Thorne 
said. “He’s a clergyman of the 
Brotherhood of the Afterlife.” 

“What’s that?” 

“It’s a new religion, outgrowth 
of the Crazy Years. During that 
time, there was a great religious 
controversy . .” 

The burning question of the 
2040s was the spiritual status of 
the hereafter. It became even 
worse after Hereafter, Inc., an- 
nounced the advent of the scientif- 
ic hereafter. The corporation tried 
desperately hard to avoid any re- 
ligious involvement, but involve- 
ment couldn’t very well be 
avoided. Most churchmen felt that 
science was unfairly pre-empting 
their territory. Hereafter, Inc., 
whether it liked or not, was consid- 
ered the spokesman for a new sci- 
entific religious position: That sal- 
vation lay, not through religious, 
moral or ethical considerations, but 
through an applied, impersonal, 
invariant scientific principle. 

Convocations, meetings and con- 
gresses were held to decide the 
burning question. Some groups 
adopted the view that the newly 
revealed scientific hereafter was 
obviously not heaven, salvation, 
nirvana or paradise, because the 
soul was not involved. Mind, they 
held, is not synonymous with soul, 
nor is the soul contained in or a 
part of the mind. 



Granted, science had found a 
means of extending the existence 
of one portion of the mind-body 
entity. That was fine, but it didn’t 
affect the soul at all, and certain- 
ly didn’t mean immortality or 
heaven or nirvana or anything like 
that. The soul could not be af- 
fected by scientific manipulation. 
And the soul’s disposition after the 
eventual and inevitable death of 
the mind in its scientific here- 
after would be in accordance with 
traditional moral, ethical and re- 
ligious practices. 

V|^OW!” Blaine said. “I think 
” I get what you mean. They 
were trying to achieve a coexist- 
ence between science and religion. 
But wasn’t their reasoning a little 
subtle for some people?” 

“Yes,” Marie Thorne said, “even 
though they explained it much 
better than I’ve done, and backed 
it up with all sorts of analogies. 
But that was only one position. 
Others didn’t attemprt: coexistence. 
The standard religions held firm. 
They simply declared that the sci- 
entific hereafter was sinful. And 
one group solved the problem by 
joining the scientific position and 
declaring that the soul is contained 
in the mind.” 

“I suppose that would be the 
Brotherhood of the Afterlife?” 
“Yes. They splintered off from 
other religions. According to them, 
the mind contains the soul, and 



22 



GALAXY 



the hereafter is the soul’s rebirth 
after death, with no spiritual ifs 
and buts.” 

“That’s keeping up with the 
times,” Blaine said. “But moral- 
ity—” 

“In their view, this didn’t dis- 
pense with morality. The After- 
lifers say that you can’t impose 
morals and ethics on p)eople by a 
system of spiritual rewards and 
punishments; and if you could, 
you shouldn’t. They say that 
morality must be good in its own 
right, first in terms of the social 
organism, second in terms of the 
individual man’s best good.” 

To Blaine, this seemed a lot to 
ask of morality. “I suppose it’s a 
popular religion?” he asked. 

“Very popular,” Marie Thorne 
answered. 

Blaine wanted to ask more, but 
Brother James had begun speak- 
ing. 

“William Fitzsimmons,” the 
clergyman said to the host, “you 
have come to this place of your 
own free will, for the purpose of 
discontinuing your existence upon 
the earthly plane and resuming it 
upon the spiritual plane?” 

“Yes, Brother,” the pale host 
whispered. 

“And the proper scientific in- 
strumentality has been performed 
so that you may continue your 
existence upon the spiritual 
plane?” 

“Yes, Brother.” 



B rother James turned to 
Reilly. “Kenneth Reilly, you 
have come to this place of your 
own free will for the purpose of 
continuing your existence upon 
Earth in the body of William 
Fitzsimmons?” 

“Yes, Brother,” Reilly said, 
small and hard-faced. 

“And you have made possible 
for William Fitzsimmons an en- 
trance into the hereafter; and have 
paid a sum of money to Fitzsim- 
mons’ heirs; and have paid the 
government tax involved in trans- 
actions of this kind?” 

“Yes, Brother,” Reilly said. 
“All these things being so,” 
Brother James said, “no crime is 
involved, civic or religious. Here 
there is no taking of life, for the 
life and personality of William 
Fitzsimmons continue vmabated in 
the hereafter, and the life and 
personality of Kenneth Reilly con- 
tinue unabated upon Earth. There- 
fore, let the reincarnation pro- 
ceed!” 

To Blaine, it seemed a hideous 
mixture of wedding ceremony and 
execution. The smiling clergyman 
withdrew. Technicians secured the 
men to their chairs and attached 
electrodes to their arms, legs and 
foreheads. The theater grew very 
still and the Rex directors leaned 
forward expectantly in their seats. 

“Go ahead,” Reilly said, look- 
ing at Blaine and smiling slightly. 
The chief technician turned a 



TIME KILLER

dial on the black machine. It 
hummed loudly and the floodlights 
dimmed. Both men jerked convul- 
sively against the straps, then 
slumped back. 

Blaine whispered, “They’re mur- 
dering that poor Fitzsimmons 
sucker.” 

“That poor sucker,” Marie 
Thorne told him, “knew exactly 
what he was doing. He’s thirty- 
seven years old and he’s been a 
failure all his life. He’s never been 
able to hold a job for long and 
had no previous chance for sur- 
vival after death. This was a mar- 
velous opportunity for him. Fur- 
thermore, he has a wife and five 
children for whom he has not been 
able to provide. The sum Mr. 
Reilly paid will enable the wife 
to support the children and give 
them a decent education.” 

“Hurray for them,” said Blaine. 
“For sale, one father with slight- 
ly used body in excellent condi- 
tion. Must sell! Sacrifice!” 

“You’re being ridiculous,” she 
said. 

“Nothing yet!” the doctor called. 

Blaine could sense apprehen- 
sion in the room, and a hint of 
fear. The seconds dragged by while 
the doctors and technicians clus- 
tered around the host. 

“Still nothing!” the doctor called, 
his voice going shrill. 

“What’s happening?” Blaine 
asked Marie Thorne. 

“As I told you, reincarnation is 



tricky and dangerous. Reilly’s 
mind hasn’t been able to possess 
the host body yet. He doesn’t have 
much longer.” 

“Why not?” 

“Because a body starts dying 
the moment it’s untenanted. Ir- 
reversible death processes start if 
a mind isn’t at least dormant in 
the body. The mind is essential. 
Even an unconscious mind con- 
trols the automatic processes. But 
with no mind at all—” 

“Still nothing!” the doctor 
shouted. 

nPHE body of Fitzsimmons sud- 
denly writhed against the 
straps. His back arched until they 
could hear the dry cracking of his 
spine. His hands wrenched at the 
arms of the chair and blood 
spouted from his nose, eyes and 
ears. Then his body sagged back. 

“Reverse the process!” the doc- 
tor screamed. “Put Mr. Reilly 
back in his own body!” 

The technicians turned to their 
dials, and the doctor, his face fiery 
red, bent over Reilly. 

“I think it’s too late now,” Marie 
Thorne whispered. 

“A tremor!” the doctor said. “I 
felt a tremor.” 

There was a long silence. 

“I think he’s back in!” the doc- 
tor exclaimed. “Now, oxygen, 
adrenalin!” 

A mask was fitted over Reilly’s 
face. A hypodermic was slipped 



24 



GALAXY 



into his arm. He stirred, shivered, 
slump>ed back, stirred again. 

“He’s made it!” the doctor 
cried, removing the oxygen mask. 

The directors, as though on cue, 
hurried out of their chairs and 
went up on the stage. They sur- 
rounded Reilly, who was now 
blinking his eyes and retching. 

“We’ll try another host, Mr. 
Reilly.” 

“Welcome back, sir!” 

“Had us worried, Mr. Reilly!” 

Reilly stared at them. He wiped 
his mouth and said, “My name is 
not Reilly.” 

The red-faced doctor pushed his 
way through the directors and bent 
down beside him. 

“Not Reilly?” he said. “Are 
you Fitzsimmons?” 

“No. I’m not Fitzsimmons, that 
poor damned fool! And I’m not 
Reilly. Reilly and I both tried to 
enter Fitzsimmons’ body, and we 
ruined it. Then Reilly tried to get 
back into his own body, but I 
was too quick. I got into the body 
first. It’s my body now.” 

“Who are you?” the doctor 
snapped. 

The man stood up. The direc- 
tors stepped away from him, and 
one man quickly crossed him- 
self. 

“It was dead too long,” Marie 
Thorne said. 

The face now bore only the 
faintest and most stylized resem- 
blance to the pale, frightened mon- 



key face of Reilly. There was 
nothing of his determination, petu- 
lance and good humor in that face. 
It resembled nothing but itself. 

TT was a dead-white face ex- 
cept for black dots of stubble 
on its cheeks and jaw. The lips 
were bloodless. A strand of wispy 
hair was plastered against its cold 
white forehead. When Reilly had 
been in residence, the features had 
blended pleasantly, harmonious- 
ly. But now the individual features 
had coarsened and grown separate. 

The unharmonious white face 
had a thick and unfinished look, 
like iron before temp>ering or clay 
before firing. It had a slack, sul- 
len, relaxed look because of the 
lack of muscle tone and tension 
in the face. The calm, flaccid, 
unharmonious features simply 
existed, revealing nothing of the 
personality behind them. The face 
seemed no longer completely hu- 
man. All humanity now resided in 
the great, patient, unblinking Bud- 
dha’s eyes. 

■ “It’s gone zombie,” Marie 
Thorne whispered, clinging to 
Blaine’s shoulder. 

“Who are you?” the doctor 
asked. 

“I don’t remember,” it said. “I 
don’t remember at all.” Slowly it 
turned and started walking down 
the stage. Two directors moved to 
bar its path. 

“Leave him alone,” the govern- 



TIME KILLER 



25 



merit man said. “Don’t touch him.” 
“But someone is in Mr. Reilly’s 
body!” a director objected. “We 
must find out who.” 

“You know the law,” said the 
government man. “The piossessor 
of a body is the sole arbiter of its 
movements. Stand aside.” 

“Leave the poor zombie alone,” 
the doctor said wearily. 

The directors moved out of its 
way. The zombie walked to the 
end of the stage, descended the 
steps, turned, and walked over to 
Blaine. 

“I know you!” it said. 

“What? What do you want?” 
Blaine stammered nervously. 

“I don’t remember,” the zombie 
said, staring hard at him. “What’s 
your name?” 

“Tom Blaine.” 

' I ■’HE zombie shook its head. 

“Doesn’t mean anything to me. 
But I’ll remember. It’s you, all 
right. Something . My body’s 
dying, isn’t it? Too bad. I’ll re- 
member before it gives out. You 
and me, you know, together. 
Blaine, don’t you remember me?” 
“No!” Blaine shouted, shrinking 
from the suggested relationship, 
the idea of some vital link between 
him and this dying thing. It 
couldn’t be! What shared secret 
was this thief of corpses, this un- 
clean usurper hinting at, what 
black intimacy, what sniggering 
knowledge to be shared like a 



dirty crust of bread for just Blaine 
and himself? 

Nothing, Blaine told himself. 
He knew himself, knew what he 
was, knew what he had been. 
Nothing like this could arise legit- 
imately to confront him. The crea- 
ture had to be crazy, or mistaken. 

“Who are you?” Blaine asked. 

“I don’t know!” The zombie 
flung his hands into the air, like a 
man caught in a net. 

Blaine sensed how his mind 
must feel, confused, disoriented, 
nameless, wanting to live and 
caught in the fleshy dying embrace 
of a zombie body. 

“I’ll see you again,” the zombie 
said to Blaine. “You’re important 
to me. I’ll see you again and I’ll 
remember about you and me.” 

The zombie representative came 
forward, took the new zombie’s 
hand and led him down the aisle 
and out of the theater. Blaine 
stared after them until he felt a 
sudden weight on his shoulder. 

Marie Thorne had fainted. It 
was the most feminine thing she 
had done so far. 

VI 

^ I ■'HE head technician and the 
bearded doctor were arguing 
near the reincarnation machine, 
with their assistants ranged respect- 
fully behind them. The battle was 
quite technical, but Blaine gath- 
ered that they were trying to de- 



26 



GALAXY 



termine the cause of the reincar- 
nation failure. Each seemed to feel 
that the fault lay in the other’s 
province. 

The old doctor insisted that the 
machine settings must have been 
faulty, or an uncompensated power 
drop had occurred. The head tech- 
nician swore the machine was per- 
fect. He felt certain that Reilly 
hadn’t been physically fit for the 
strenuous attempt. 

Neither would yield an inch. 
But, being reasonable men, they 
soon reached a compromise solu- 
tion. The fault; they decided, lay 
in the nameless spirit who had 
fought Reilly for possession of his 
body, and had supplanted him. 

“But who was it?” the head tech- 
nician asked. “A ghost, do you 
think?” 

“Possibly,” the doctor said, 
“though it’s damned rare for a 
ghost to possess a living body. 
Still, he talked crazy enough to be 
a ghost.” 

“Whoever he was,” said the 
head technician, “he took over too 
late. The body was definitely zom- 
bie. Anyhow, no one could be 
blamed for it.” 

“Right,” the doctor agreed. “I’ll 
certify to the apparent soundness 
of the equipment.” 

“Fair enough,” said the head 
technician. “And I’ll testify to the 
apparent soundness of the patient.” 

They exchanged looks of per- 
fect understanding. 



The directors were holding an 
immediate conference of their own, 
trying to determine what the 
short-range effects would be upon 
the Rex corporate structure, and 
how the announcement should be 
made to the public, and whether 
all Rex personnel should be given 
a day off to visit the Reilly Family 
Palace of Death. 

Then they noticed Blaine. Low- 
ering their voices, they began to 
whisper together, glancing at him 
covertly. 

Fitzsimmons’ body lay back in 
its chair, beginning to stiffen, wear- 
ing a detached, derisive smile. 

Marie Thorne recovered con- 
sciousness and promptly took in 
the situation. “Come on,” she said, 
leading Blaine out of the theater. 
They hurried down long gray cor- 
ridors to a street door. Outside, 
she hailed a helicab and gave the 
driver an address. 

“Where are we going?” Blaine 
asked, as the helicab climbed. 

“I’m not sure. Rex is going to 
be a madhouse for a while.” She 
began fussing with her hair. “I 
don’t know what the directors 
wanted to do with you, but it’s 
lucky the government man was 
there. Let me think a moment.” 

"D LAINE settled back against 
the cushions and looked down 
on the glittering city. From that 
height, it looked like an exquisite 
miniature, a multi-colored mosaic

from the Thousand and One 
Nights. But somewhere down 
there, walking the streets and 
levels, was the zombie, trying to 
remember — him. 

‘‘But why me?” Blaine asked 
out loud. 

Marie Thorne glanced at him. 
"Why you and the zombie? Well, 
why not? Haven’t you ever made 
any mistakes?” 

“I suppose I have. But they’re 
finished and done with.” 

She shook her head. “Maybe 
.mistakes ended for good in your 
time. Today nothing ever dies for 
certain. That's one of the great 
disadvantages of a life after death, 
you know. One’s mistakes some- 
times refuse to lie decently dead 
and buried. Sometimes they fol- 
low you around.” 

“So I see,” Blaine said. “But 
I’ve never done anything that 
would bring up that!" 

She shrugged indifferently. “In 
that case, you’re better than most 
of us.” 

Never had she seemed more 
alien to him. 

The helicab began a slow 
descent. And Blaine brooded over 
the disadvantages inherent in all 
advantages. 

In his own time, he had seen 
the control of disease in the 
world’s backward areas result in 
an exploding birth rate, famine, 
misery. He had seen nuclear power 
breed nuclear war. Every advan- 



tage generated its own spiecific dis- 
advantages. Why should it be dif- 
ferent today? 

A certified scientific hereafter 
was undoubtedly an advantage to 
the race. Manipulation had again 
caught up with theory. But the 
disadvantages . 

There was a certain inevitable 
weakening of the , protective bar- 
rier around mundane life, some 
rips in the curtain, a few holes in 
the dike. The dead refused to lie 
decently still; they insisted upon 
mingling with the quick. To whose 
advantage? Ghosts, too— undoubt- 
edly logical, operating within the 
boundaries of known natural laws. 
But that might be cold comfort 
to a haunted man. 

Today, Blaine thought, whole 
new strata of existence impinged 
upon Man’s existence on Earth. 
Just as the zombie impinged un- 
comfortably upon his existence. 

Marie Thorne had been think- 
ing hard. She said, “You should 
stay out of sight a while, until 
Rex quiets down. I’m going to in- 
troduce you to a man. I don’t 
know him very well, but I’ve 
been told he’s reliable.” 

Blaine silently wondered if she 
was reliable. Perhaps not. Per- 
haps this was a Rex scheme to get 
rid of him without the knowledge 
of the government man. But he 
had no friends in this world, no 
money, no knowledge. He would 
have to play along. 



28 



GALAXY 



But that didn’t mean he had to 
trust anyone. 

The helicab landed on a busy 
street corner. Marie Thorne paid 
and hurried him into the crowds. 

A T first glance, the city looked 
like a surrealistic Bagdad. 
He saw squat palaces of white and 
blue tile, and slender red minarets, 
and irregularly shaped buildings 
with flaring Chinese roofs and 
spired onion domes. It looked as 
though an Oriental fad in architec- 
ture had swept the city. Blaine 
could hardly believe he was in 
New York. Bombay perhaps, Mos- 
cow, or even Los Angeles. But not 
New York. With relief, he saw 
skyscrapers, simple and direct 
against the curved Asiatic struc- 
tures. They seemed like lonely 
sentinels of the New York he 
had known. 

The streets were filled with 
miniature traffic. Blaine saw motor- 
cycles and scooters, cars no bigger 
than Porsches, trucks the size of 
Buicks, and nothing larger. He 
wondered if this was New York’s 
answer to congestion and air pol- 
lution. If so, it hadn’t helped. 

Most of the traffic was over- 
head. There were vane- and jet- 
operated vehicles, aerial produce 
trucks and one-man speedsters, 
helicopter taxis and floating buses 
labeled “Sky port 2nd Level” or 
“Express to Montauk.” Glittering 
dots marked the vertical and hori- 



zontal lanes within which the traf- 
fic glided, banked, turned, as- 
cended and descended. Flashing 
red, green, yellow and blue lights 
seemed to regulate the flow. 

There were rules and conven- 
tions; but to Blaine’s inexperi- 
enced eye, it was a vast flutter- 
ing confusion. 

Fifty feet overhead there was 
another shopping level. How did 
people get up there? For that mat- 
ter, how did anyone live and re- 
tain his sanity in this noisy, bright, 
congested machine? The human 
density was overpowering. He felt 
as though he were being drowned 
in a sea of flesh. What was the 
population of this super-city? Fif- 
teen million? Twenty million? It 
made the New York of 1958 look 
like a country village. He stared 
around him, his head p>ounding 
dully and his eyes beginning to 
unfocus. 

In a few moments, he was in 
control of himself again, and 
slightly more respectful of his 
strong, phlegmatic body. Perhaps 
a man from the past needed just 
that sort of fleshy envelope if he 
wanted to view the future with 
equanimity. A low-order nervous 
system had its advantages. 

He noticed a group of people 
standing in a line. The men and 
women on it were poorly dressed, 
unkempt, unwashed. They shared 
a common look of sullen despair. 

Was it a breadline? 



TIME KILLER

He asked Marie where the line 
was going. 

“To the suicide booths,” she 
told him, hurrying him past it. 

It was, Blaine decided, a hell 
of an inauspicious thing to see on 
his first real day in the future. 
Suicide booths! Well, he would 
never enter one willingly, he could 
be absolutely sure of that. Things 
surely couldn’t get that bad. 

But what kind of world had 
suicide booths? And free ones, to 
judge by the clientele . 

He would have to be careful 
about accepting free gifts in this 
world. 

T>LAINE walked on with Marie, 
gawking at the sights and 
slowly growing accustomed to the 
bright, hectic, boisterous, over- 
crowded city. 

They came to an enormous 
building shaped like a Gothic 
castle, with p>ennants flying from 
its upper battlements. On its high- 
est tower was a brilliant green 
light fully visible against the fad- 
ing afternoon sun. It looked like 
an important landmark. 

A man was leaning against the 
building, lighting a thin cigar. He 
seemed to be the only man in 
New York not in a tearing hurry. 
Marie walked over to him. 

“Mr. Ore?” 

“Yes, Miss Thorne.” 

“This is Tom Blaine. I’d like 
you to take care of him.” 



“Sure,” Ore said. 

“I’ll make further arrangements 
with you later. Now I must get 
back. Good luck,” she said to 
Blaine, and hurried away. 

Blaine and Ore faced each other 
in mutual embarrassment. To 
break the silence, Blaine asked, 
“What is this building?” 

“This,” Ore said, “is the head- 
quarters of Hereafter, Incorpo- 
rated.” He was a tall man, very 
thin, with a long, mournful, 
weatherbeaten face. His eyes were 
narrow and direct. His clothes 
hung awkwardly on him, as though 
he were more used to levis than 
tailored slacks. Blaine thought he 
looked like a Westerner. 

“Impressive,” Blaine said, gaz- 
ing up at the Gothic castle. 

“Gaudy,” said Ore. “You aren’t 
from the city, are you?” 

Blaine shook his head. 

“Me neither. But frankly, 
Blaine, I thought everybody on 
Earth and all the planets knew 
about the Hereafter building. Do 
you mind my asking where you’re 
from?” 

“Not at all,” Blaine said, his 
mind racing. He wondered if he 
should announce himself a man 
from the past. No, it was hardly 
the thing to tell a possibly un- 
trustworthy stranger, particularly 
in view of the situation at Rex. 
He’d better be from somewhere 
else. 

Blaine said, “I’m from— Brazil.” 



30 



GALAXY 



“Oh?” 

“Yes. Upper Amazon Valley. 
My folks went there when I was 
a kid. Rubber plantation. Dad just 
died, so I thought I’d have a look 
at New York.” 

“I hear it’s still pretty wild 
down there,” Ore said. 

Blaine nodded, relieved that his 
story wasn’t being questioned. But 
maybe it wasn’t a very strange 
story for this day and age. In any 
event, he had found a home for 
himself. 

O RC said, “I’m from Mexican 
Hat, Arizona. Carl Ore’s the 
name. I came here to cast a look 
around this New York and find 
out what they’re always boasting 
about. It’s interesting enough, but 
these folks are just a little too up 
and roaring for me, if you catch 
my meaning. I don’t mean to say 
we’re poky back home. We’re not. 
But these j>eople bounce around 
like an ape with a stick in his line.” 
“I know just what you mean,” 
Blaine said. 

For a few minutes, they dis- 
cussed the jittery, frantic, com- 
pulsive habits of New Yorkers, 
comparing them with the sane, 
calm, pastoral life in Mexican Hat 
and the Upper Amazon Valley. 
These people, they agreed, just 
didn’t know how to live. 

“Blaine,” said Ore, “business 
and pleasure can mix. What say 
we get ourselves a drink?” 



Blaine hesitated, wondering how 
he would talk with Ore; then he 
remembered that he could plead 
Brazil and inadequate schooling to 
excuse his lack of present-day 
knowledge. 

“Fine,” he said. 

“Then let us proceed,” said Ore 
somberly, “to inspect the internal 
nocturnal movements of this edgy 
little old town.” 

It was, Blaine decided, as good 
a way as any other of finding out 
about the future. After all, nothing 
could be more revealing than what 
people did for pleasure. Through 
games and drunkenness, Man ex- 
hibits his essential attitudes toward 
his environment, and shows his 
disposition toward the questions of 
life, death, fate and free will. 

What better symbol of Rome 
than the circus? What better crys- 
tallization of the American West 
than the rodeo? Spain had its bull- 
fights and Norway its ski-jumps. 
What sport, recreation or pastime 
would similarly reveal the New 
York of 2110? He would find out. 
And, surely, to experience this in 
all its immediacy was better than 
reading about it in some dusty 
library, and infinitely more enter- 
taining. 

“Suppose we have a look at the 
Martian Quarter?” Carl Ore sug- 
gested. 

“Lead away,” Blaine said, well 
pleased at the chance to combine 
pleasure with stern necessity.

tJLAINE followed through a 
maze of streets and levels, 
through underground arcades and 
overhead ramps, by foot, escalator, 
subway and helicab. The inter- 
locking complexity of streets and 
levels didn’t impress the lean Wes- 
terner. Phoenix was laid out in the 
same way, he said, although ad- 
mittedly on a smaller scale. 

They went to a small restau- 
rant that called itself the Red 
Mars and advertised a genuine 
South Martian cuisine. Blaine had 
to confess he had never eaten Mar- 
tian food. Ore had sampled it sev- 
eral times in Phoenix. 

“It’s pretty good,” he told 
Blaine, “but you’re hungry an 
hour later.” 

The menu was written entirely 
in Martian, and no English trans- 
lation was included. Blaine reck- 
lessly ordered the Number One 
Combination, as did Ore. It came, 
a strange-looking mess of shredded 
vegetables and bits of meat. Blaine 
tasted, and nearly dropp>ed his 
fork in surprise. 

“It’s exactly like Chinese food!” 

“Well, of course,” Ore said. “The 
Chinese were the first on Mars— 
in ’97, I think. So anything they 
eat up there is Martian food. 
Right?” 

“I suppose so,” Blaine said. 

“Besides, this stuff is made with 
genuine Martian-grown vegetables 
and mutated herbs and spices. Or 
so they claim.”

Blaine didn’t know whether to 
be disappointed or relieved. With 
good appetite, he ate the C’kyo- 
Ourher, which tasted just like 
shrimp chow mein, and the 
Trrdxat, or egg roll. 

“Why do they give it such weird 
names?” Blaine asked, ordering 
the Hggshrt for dessert. 

“Man, you’re really out of 
touch!” Ore said, laughing. “Those 
Martian Chinese went all the way. 
They translated the Martian rock- 
carvings and suchlike, and started 
to talk Martian— with a strong 
Cantonese accent, I reckon — but 
there wasn’t no one around to tell 
them different. They talk Martian, 
dress Martian, think Martian. You 
call one of them a ' Chinese now, 
he’d up and hit you. He’s a Mar- 
tian, boy!” 

The Hggshrt came, and turned 
out to be an almond cookie. 

Ore paid the check. As they left, 
Blaine asked, “Are there many 
Martian laundries?” 

“Hell, yes. Country’s filled with 
them.” 

“I thought so,” Blaine said, and 
paid a silent tribute to the Martian 
Chinese and their firm grip on 
traditional institutions. 

' I ^HEY caught a helicab to the 
Greens Club, a place that Ore’s 
Phoenix friends had told him not 
to miss. This small, exj>ensive, in- 
timate little club was world- 
famous, an absolute must for any 



visitor to New York. For the 
Greens Club was unique in pre- 
senting an all-vegetable floor show. 

They were given seats on a 
little balcony, not far from the 
glass-fenced center of the club. 
Three levels of tables surrounded 
the center, and brilliant spotlights 
played upon it. Behind the glass 
fence was what looked like a few 
square yards of jungle, growing 
in a nutrient solution. An artificial 
breeze stirred the plants, which 
were packed tight together, and 
varied widely in size, shap>e and 
hue. 

They behaved like no plants 
Blaine had ever seen. They grew 
rapidly, fantastically, from tiny 
seeds and root tendrils to great 
shrubs and rough-barked trees, 
squat ferns, monstrous flowers, 
dripping green fungus and speckled 
vines; grew and quickly completed 
their life-cycle and fell into decay, 
casting forth their seeds to begin 
again. 

But no species seemed able to 
reproduce itself. Sp>orts and mu- 
tants sprang from the seeds and 
swollen fruit, altered and adapted 
to the fierce environment, battled 
for root space below and air space 
above, and struggled toward the 
artificial suns that glowed above 
them. Unsuccessful shrubs quickly 
molded themselves into parasites, 
clung to the choked trees, and 
discovered new adaptations cling- 
ing to them in turn.

Sometimes, in a burst of crea- 
tive ambition, a plant would sur- 
mount all obstacles, put down the 
growths around it, strangle the op- 
position, conquer all. But new spe- 
cies already grew from its body, 
pulled it down and squabbled over 
the corpse. Sometimes a blight, 
itself vegetable, would attack the 
jungle and carry everything before 
it in a grand crescendo of mold. 
But a courageous sport would at 
last take root in it, then another, 
and on went the fight. 

The plants changed, grew larger 
or smaller, transcended themselves 
in the struggle for survival. But no 
amount of determination, no cun- 
ning, no transcendence helf>ed. No 
species could prevail, and every 
endeavor led to death. 

Blaine found the spectacle dis- 
turbing. Could this fatalistic pag- 
eant of the world be the signifi- 
cant characteristic of 2110? 

“It’s really something,” Ore told 
him, “what these New York labs 
can do with quick-growing mu- 
tants. It’s a freak show, of course. 
They just speed up the growing 
rate, force a contra-survival situa- 
tion, throw in some radiation, and 
let the best plant try to win. I 
hear these plants use up their 
growth potential in about twenty 
hours and have to be replaced.” 

“So that’s where it ends,” Blaine 
said, watching the tortured but 
ever-optimistic jungle. “In replace- 
ments.” 



“Sure,” said Ore, blandly avoid- 
ing all philosophical complications. 
“They can afford it, the prices 
they charge here. But it’s freak 
stuff. Let me tell you about the 
sandplants we grow in Arizona.” 

"DLAINE sipped his whiskey 
and watched the jungle grow- 
ing, dying and renewing itself. Ore 
was saying, “Right on the burn- 
ing face of the desert. Fact. We’ve 
finally adapted fruit and vegetable- 
bearing plants to real desert con- 
ditions, without increasing their 
bulk water supply, and at a price 
which allows us to compete with 
the fertile areas. I tell you, boy, 
in another fifty years the entire 
concept of fertile is going to 
change. Take Mars, for ex- 
ample . .” 

They left the Greens Club and 
worked their way from bar to bar, 
toward Times Square. Ore was 
showing a certain difficulty in 
focusing, but his voice was steady 
as he talked about the lost Mar- 
tian secret of growing on sand. 
“Someday,” he promised Blaine, 
“we’ll figure out how they pro- 
duced the sandplants without the 
added nutrients and moisture-fixa- 
tives.” 

Blaine had drunk enough to 
put his former body into a coma 
twice over. But his bulky new 
body seemed to have an inexhaust- 
ible capacity for whiskey. It was 
a pleasant change to have a body 



TIME KILLER 



35 



that could hold its liquor. Not, 
he added hastily, that such a ru- 
dimentary ability could offset the 
body’s disadvantages. 

They crossed Times Square’s 
garish confusion and entered a 
bar on 44th Street. As their drinks 
were served, a furtive-eyed little 
man in a raincoat stepped up to 
them. 

“Hey, boys,” he said tentatively. 

“Whatcha want, podner?” Ore 
asked. 

“You boys out looking for a 
little fun?” 

“You might say so,” Ore said 
expansively. “And we can find it 
ourselves, thank you kindly.” 

The little man smiled nervous- 
ly. “You can’t find what I’m of- 
fering,” he said. “Not if you walked 
these streets all night. You can 
find plenty of bars and shag joints 
and dog kennels and rundowns, 
and there’s a couple of greasy 
mirandas on the corner, if you 
want that. But you can’t find what 
I’m offering.” 

“Speak up, little friend,” Ore 
said. “What exactly are you offer- 
ing?” 

“Well, boys, it’s - hold it! Flat- 
hats!” 

Two blue-uniformed policemen 
entered the bar, looked around 
and left. 

“Okay,” Blaine said. “What is 
it?” 

“Call me Joe,” said the little 
man with an ingratiating grin. “I’m 



a steerer for a Transplant game, 
friends. The best game and highest 
jump in town!” 

“What in hell is Transplant?” 
Blaine asked. 

O RC and Joe both looked at 
him. Joe said, “Wow, friend, 
no insult but you must really be 
from down on the farm. Never 
heard of Transplant? Well, I’ll be 
griped!” 

“All right, so I’m a farmboy,” 
Blaine growled, thrusting his fierce, 
square, hard-planed face close to 
Joe’s. ‘What is Transplant?” 

“Not so loud!” Joe whispered, 
shrinking back. “Take it easy, farm- 
er, I’ll explain. Transplant is the 
new switch game, buddy. Are you 
tired of living? Think you’ve had 
all the kicks? Wait till you try 
Transplant. You see, farmer, folks 
in the know say that straight sex 
is pretty moldy potatoes. Don’t 
get me wrong, it’s fine for the 
birds and the bees and the beasts 
and the brutes. It still brings a 
thrill to their simple animal hearts, 
and who are we to say they’re 
wrong? As a means of propagating 
the spjecies, old nature’s little sex 
gimmick is still the first and the 
best. But for real kicks, sophisti- 
cated people are turning to Trans- 
plant. 

“Transplant is democratic, 
friends. It gives you the big chance 
to switch over into someone else 
and feel how the other ninety- 



36 



GALAXY 



nine per cent feels. It’s educa- 
tional, you might say, and it takes 
up where straight sex leaves off. 
Ever get the urge to be a high- 
strung Latin, pal? You can, with 
Transplant. Ever wonder what a 
genuine sadist feels? Tune in with 
Transplant. And there’s more, 
more, so much more! For example, 
why be a man all your life? 
You’ve proved your point by now; 
why belabor it?” 

“Voyeurism,” Blaine spat. 

“I know them big words,” Joe 
said, “and it ain’t true. This is no 
Peeping Tom’s game. With Trans- 
plant, you are there, right in the old 
corpus, moving those exotic 
muscles, experiencing those sensa- 
tions. Ever get the urge to be a 
tiger, farmboy, and go loping after 
a lady tiger in the old mating 
season? We ^ot a tiger, friend, and 
a lady tiger too. Ever ask yourself 
what thrill a man could possibly 
find in flagellation, shoe-fetichism, 
necrophilia, or the like? Find out 
with Transplant. Our catalogue of 
bodies reads like an encyclopedia. 
You can’t go wrong at Transplant, 
friends, and our prices are set 
ridiculously—” 

“Get out,” Blaine said. 

“What, buddy?” 

Blaine’s big hand shot out and 
grabbed Joe by the raincoat front. 
He lifted the little pusher to eye 
level and glared at him. 

“You take your perverted little 
notions out of here,” Blaine said. 



“Guys like you have been selling 
off-beat kicks since the days of 
Babylon, and guys like me haven’t 
been buying. Get out, before I 
break your neck for a quick sadis- 
tic thrill.” 

He released him. 

J OE smoothed his raincoat and 
smiled shakily. “No offense, 
buddy. I’m going. Don’t feel like 
it tonight? There’s always another 
night. Transplant’s in your future, 
farmboy. Why fight it?” 

Blaine started to move forward, 
but Ore held him back. The little 
pusher scuttled out the door. 

“He isn’t worth dropping,” Ore 
said. “The flathats would just take 
you in. It’s a sad, sick, dirty world, 
friend. Drink up.” 

Blaine threw down his whiskey, 
still seething. Transplant! If that 
was the characteristic amusement 
of 2110, he wanted no part of it. 
Ore was right, it was a sad, sick, 
dirty world. Even the whiskey was 
beginning to taste funny. 

He grabbed at the bar for sup- 
port. The whiskey tasted very 
funny. What was wrong with him? 
The stuff seemed to be going to 
his head. 

Ore’s arm was around his shoul- 
der. He was saying, “Well, well, 
my old buddy’s taken himself that 
one too many. Guess I’d better 
cart him back to his hotel.” 

But Ore didn’t know where his 
hotel was. He didn’t even have a 



TIME KILLER 



37 



hotel to be taken to. Ore — that 
damned quick-talking straight- 
eyed Ore must have put some- 
thing in his drink while he was 
talking to Joe. 

In order to roll him? But Ore 
knew he had no money. Why 
then? 

He tried to shake the arm off 
his shoulders. It was clamped in 
place like an iron bar. 

“Don’t worry,” Ore was saying, 
“I’ll take care of you, old buddy.” 

The barroom revolved lazily 
around Blaine’s head. He had a 
sudden realization that he was 
going to find out a great deal about 
2100 by the dubious method of 
direct experience. Too much, he 
suspected. Perhaps a dusty library 
would have been better, after all. 

The barroom began to revolve 
more rapidly. 

He passed out. 

VII 

LAINE recovered conscious- 
ness in a small, dimly lighted 
room with no furniture, no doors 
or windows, and only a single 
screened ventilation outlet in the 
ceiling. The floors and walls were 
thickly padded, but the padding 
hadn’t been washed in a long time. 
It stank. 

Blaine sat up, and two red-hot 
needles stabbed him through the 
eyes. He lay down again. 

“Relax,” a voice said. “These 



knock drops take a while to wear 
off.” 

He was not alone in the padded 
room. There was a man sitting in 
a corner, watching him. The man 
was wearing only shorts. Glancing 
at himself, Blaine saw that he was 
similarly dressed. 

He sat up slowly and propped 
himself against a wall. For a mo- 
ment, he was afraid his head 
would explode. Then, as the 
needles drove viciously in, he was 
afraid it wouldn’t. 

“What is this?” he asked. 

“End of the line,” the man said 
cheerfully. “They boxed you, just 
like me. They boxed you and 
brought you in like fabrit. Now 
all they got to do is crate you and 
label you.” 

Blaine couldn’t understand what 
the man was saying. He was in 
no mood to decipher 2100 slang. 
Clutching his head, he said, “I 
don’t have any money. Why did 
they box me?” 

“Come off it,” the man said. 
“Why would they box you? They 
want your body, man!” 

“My body?” 

“Right. For a host.” 

A host body, Blaine thought, 
such as he was now occupying. 
Well, of course. Naturally. It was 
obvious when you came to think 
about it. This age needed a supply 
of host bodies for various and 
sundry purposes. But how do you 
get a host body? They don’t grow 



38 



GALAXY 



on trees, nor can you dig for them. 
You get them from people. Most 
people wouldn’t take kindly to 
selling their own bodies; life is so 
meaningless without one. Then 
how to fill the supply? 

Easy. You pick out a sucker, 
dope him, hide him away, extract 
his mind, then take his body. 

It was an interesting line of 
speculation, but Blaine couldn’t 
continue it any longer. It seemed 
as though his head had finally de- 
cided to explode. 

T ATER, the hangover subsided. 

Blaine sat up and found a 
sandwich in front of him on a 
paper plate, and a cup of some 
dark beverage. 

“It’s safe to eat,” the man told 
him. “They take good care of us. I 
hear the going black market price 
for a body is close to four thou- 
sand dollars.” 

“Black market?” 

“Man, what’s wrong with you? 
Wake up! You know there’s a 
black market in bodies just like 
there’s an op>en market in bodies.” 
Blaine sipped the dark bever- 
age, which turned out to be coffee. 
The man introduced himself as 
Ray Melhill, a flow-control man 
off the spaceship Bremen. He was 
about Blaine’s age, a compact, red- 
headed, snub-nosed man with 
slightly protruding teeth. Even in 
his present predicament, he car- 
ried himself with a certain jaunty 



assurance, the unquenchable con- 
fidence of a man for whom some- 
thing always turns up. His freckled 
skin was very white except for a 
small red blotch on his neck, the 
result of an old radiation burn. 

“I should have known better,” 
Melhill said. “But we’d been trans- 
iting for three months on the aster- 
oid run and I wanted a spree. I 
would have been fine if I’d stuck 
with the boys, but we got sepa- 
rated. So I wound up in a dog ken- 
nel with a greasy miranda. She 
knocked my drink and I wound 
up here.” 

Melhill leaned back, his hands 
locked behind his head. “Me, of 
all people! I was always telling the 
boys to watch out. Stick with the 
gang, I was always telling them. 
You know, I don’t mind the 
thought of dying so much. I just 
hate the idea of those bastards 
giving my body to some dirty fat 
decrepit old slob so he can play 
around for another fifty years. 
That’s what kills me, the thought 
of some slob wearing my body!” 
Blaine nodded somberly. 

“So that’s my tale of woe,” Mel- 
hill said, growing cheerful again. 
“What’s yours?” 

“Mine’s a pretty long one,” 
Blaine said, “and a trifle wild in 
spots. Do you want to hear it all?” 
“Sure. Plenty of time. I hope.” 
“Okay. It starts in the year 
1958. Wait, don’t interrupt me. 
I was driving my car . .”

he had finished, Blaine 
” leaned back against the 
padded wall and took a deep 
breath. “Do you believe me?” 
“Why not? Nothing so new 
about time travel. It’s just illegal 
and expensive. And those Rex 
boys would pull anything.” 

“The Rex girls, too,” Blaine 
said, and Melhill grinned. 

They sat in companionable si- 
lence for a while. Then Blaine 
asked, “So they’re going to use us 
for host bodies?” 

“That’s the score.” 

“When?” 

“When a customer totters in. 
I’ve been here a week, close as I 
can figure. Either of us might be 
taken any second. Or it might not 
come for another week or two.” 
“And they just wipe our minds 
out?” 

Melhill nodded. 

“But that’s murder!” 

“It sure is,” Melhill agreed. 
“Hasn’t happened yet, though. 
Maybe the flathats will pull a 
raid.” 

“I doubt it.” 

“Me too. Have you got hereaf- 
ter insurance? Maybe you’ll sur- 
vive after death.” 

“I don’t believe in that stuff.” 
“You don’t? But life after death 
is a fact.” 

“Get off it,” Blaine said sourly. 
“It is! Scientific fact!” 

Blaine stared hard at the young 
spaceman. “Ray,” he said, “how 



about filling me in? Brief me on 
what’s happened since 1958.” 
“That’s a big order,” Melhill 
said, “and I’m not what you’d 
call an educated guy.” 

“Just give me a rough sketch. 
What’s this hereafter stuff? And 
reincarnation and host bodies? 
What’s happening?” 

Melhill leaned back and pursed 
his lips, squinting. “Well, let’s see. 
They put a ship on the Moon 
somewhere around 1960, and 
landed on Mars about ten years 
later. Then we had that quickie 
war with Russia over the asteroids 
— strictly a deep-space affair. Or 
was it with China?” 

“Never mind,” Blaine said. 
“What about reincarnation and 
life after death?” 

“I’ll try to give it to you like 
they gave it to me in high school. 
I had a course called Survey of 
Psychic Survival, but that was a 
long time ago. Let’s see.” 

ELHILL frowned in deep 
concentration. “Quote. ‘Since 
earliest times, Man has sensed the 
presence of an invisible spirit 
world, and has suspected that he 
himself will participate in that 
world after the death of his body.’ 
Unquote. I guess you know all 
about that early stuff. The Egyj>- 
tians and Chinese and the Euro- 
pean alchemists and those. So I’ll 
skip to Rhine. He lived in your 
time. He was investigating psychic 



40 



GALAXY 



phenomena at Duke. Ever hear of 
him?” 

“Sure,” Blaine said. “What did 
he discover?” 

“Nothing, as a matter of fact. 
But he got the ball rolling. Then 
Kralski took over the work at 
Vilna and shoved it ahead some. 
That was 1987, the year the 
Pirates won their first World 
Series. Around 2000, there was 
Von Leddner at the University of 
California. Very important figure. 
Von Leddner. Outlined the general 
theory of the hereafter, but didn’t 
have any proofs. And finally we 
come to Professor Michael Van- 
ning. 

“Professor Vanning is the boy 
who pinned it all down. He proved 
that people survive after death. 
Contacted them, talked with them, 
recorded them, all that stuff. Of- 
fered absolute sure-enough con- 
crete scientific proof of life after 
death. So of course there were big 
arguments about it, a lot of re- 
ligious talk. Controversy. Head- 
lines. A big-time professor from 
Harvard named James Archer 
Flynn set out to prove the whole 
thing was a hoax. He and Vanning 
argued back and forth for years. 

“By this time. Vanning was an 
old man and he decided to take 
the plunge. He sealed a lot of 
stuff in a safe, hid things here and 
there, scattered some code words 
and promised to come back, like 
Houdini said but didn’t. Then—” 



“Pardon me,” Blaine inter- 
rupted, “if there is life after death, 
why didn’t Houdini come back?” 
“It’s very simple, but please, 
one thing at a time. Anyhow, Van- 
ning killed himself, leaving a long 
suicide note about Man’s immortal 
spirit and the indomitable progress 
of the human race. It’s reprinted 
in a lot of anthologies. Later they 
found out it was ghost-written, but 
that’s another story. Where was 
I?” 

“He killed himself.” 

“Right. And damned if he didn’t 
contact Professor James Archer 
Flynn after dying, and tell him 
where to find all that hidden stuff, 
the code words, and so forth. That 
clinched it, buddy. Life after death 
was in.” 

"O AY Melhill stood up, stretched, 
and sat down again. “The 
Vanning Institute,” he said, 
“warned everybody against hys- 
teria. But hysteria there was. The 
next fifteen years are known as 
the Crazy Forties.” 

Melhill grinned and licked his 
lips. “Wish I’d been around then. 
Everybody just sort of let go. 
‘Doesn’t matter what you do,’ the 
jingle ran, ‘pie in the sky is waitin’ 
for you.’ Saint or sinner, bad or 
good, everybody gets a slice. The 
murderer walks into the hereafter 
just like the archbishop. So live it 
up, boys and girls, enjoy the flesh 
on Earth while you’re here, ’cause 



TIME KILLER 



41 



you’ll get plenty of spirit after 
death. Yep, and they really lived 
it up. Anarchy. 

“A new religion popped up call- 
ing itself Realization. It started 
telling people that they owed it to 
themselves to experience every- 
thing, good or bad, fair and foul, 
because the hereafter was just a 
long remembrance of what you 
did on Earth. So do it, they said, 
that’s what you’re put on Earth 
for, do it, or you’ll be short-changed 
in the afterlife. Gratify every de- 
sire, satisfy every lust, explore 
your blackest depths. Live high, 
die high. 

“It was wacky. The real fanatics 
formed torture clubs, and wrote 
encyclopedias on pain, and col- 
lected tortures like a housewife 
would collect recipes. At each 
meeting, a member would volun- 
tarily present himself as a victim 
and they’d kill him in the most 
excruciating damned ways they 
could find. They wanted to experi- 
ence the absolute most in pleas- 
ure and pain. And I guess they 
did.” 

Melhill wiped his forehead and 
said more sedately, “I’ve done a 
little reading on the Crazy Years.” 

“So I see,” Blaine said. 

“It’s sort of interesting stuff. 
But then came the crusher. The 
Vanning Institute had been ex- 
perimenting all this time. Around 
2050, when the Crazy Years were 
in full swing, they announced that 



there was a hereafter, sure enough; 
but not for everyone.” 

Blaine blinked, but made no 
comment. 

“A real crusher. The Vanning 
Institute said they had certain 
proof that only about one per.son 
in a million got into the here- 
after. The rest, the millions and 
millions, just went out like a light 
when they died. Pouf! No more. 
No afterlife. Nothing.” 

“Why?” Blaine wanted to know. 
“Well, Tom, I’m none too clear 
on that part myself,” Melhill told 
him. “If you asked me something 
about flow-mechanics, I could 
really tell you something; but 
psychic theory isn’t my field. So 
try to stick with me while I 
struggle through it. It goes some- 
thing like this.” 

TTE rubbed his forehead vigor- 
ously. “What survives or 
doesn’t survive after death is the 
mind. People have been arguing 
for thousands of years about what 
a mind is, and where and how it 
interacts with the body, and so 
forth. We haven’t got all the an- 
swers, but we do have some work- 
ing definitions. Nowadays, the 
mind is considered a high-tension 
energy web that emanates from 
the body, is modified by the body, 
and itself modifies the body. Got 
that?” 

“I think so. Go on.” 

“So, the way I got it, the mind 



42 



GALAXY 



and body interact and intermodify. 
But the mind can also exist inde- 
pendently of the body. According 
to a lot of scientists, the indepen- 
dent mind is the next, stage of 
evolution. In a million years, they 
say, we won’t even need a body 
except maybe for a brief incuba- 
tion period. Personally, 1 don’t 
think this lousy race will survive 
another million years. It damn 
well doesn’t deserve to.” 

“At the moment, I agree with 
you, though subject to change 
without notice,” Blaine said. “But 
get back to the hereafter.” 

“We’ve got this high-tension 
energy web. When the body dies, 
that web should be able to go on 
existing, like a butterfly coming 
out of a cocoon. Death is simply 
the process that hatches the mind 
from the body. But it doesn’t work 
that way because of the death 
trauma. Some scientists think the 
death trauma is nature’s ejecting 
mechanism, to get the mind free 
of the body. But it works too hard 
and louses up everything. Dying 
is a tremendous psychic shock, 
and most of the time the energy 
web gets disrupted, ripped all to 
hell. It can’t pull itself together, 
it dissipates, and you’re complete- 
ly dead.” 

Blaine said, “So that’s why Hou- 
dini didn’t come back.” 

“I wouldn’t say for sure in any 
individual case, just statistically. 
A lot of people did some heavy 



thinking and that ended the Crazy 
Years. The Vanning Institute went 
on working. They studied Yoga 
and stuff like that, but on a sci- 
entific basis. Some of those East- 
ern religions had the right idea, 
you know. Strengthen the mind. 
That’s what the Institute wanted: 
a way to strengthen the energy 
web so it would survive the death 
process.” 

“And they found it?” 

“In spades. Along about that 
time, they changed their name to 
Hereafter, Inc.” 

Blaine nodded. “I passed their 
building today. Hey, wait a min- 
ute! You say they solved the mind- 
strengthening problem? Then no 
one dies! Everyone survives after 
death!” 

M ELHILL grinned sardonical- 
ly. “Don’t be a farmer, Tom. 
You think they give it away free? 
Not a chance. It’s a complex elec- 
tro-chemical treatment, pal, and 
they charge for it. They charge 
plenty.” 

“So only the rich go to heaven,” 
Blaine said. 

“Can’t have just anyone crash- 
ing in.” 

“Sure, sure,” Blaine said. “But 
aren’t there other ways, other mind- 
strengthening disciplines? What 
about Yoga? What about Zen?” 
“They work,” Melhill said. 
“There are at least a dozen gov- 
ernment tested and approved 



TIME KILLER 



43 



home-survival courses. Trouble is, 
it takes about twenty years of 
really hard work to become an 
adept. That’s not for the ordinary 
guy. Nojje, without the machines 
to help you, you’re dead.” 

“And only Hereafter, Inc., has 
the machines?” 

“There are two others, the Af- 
terlife Academy and Heaven, Ltd., 
but the price stays about the same. 
The government’s getting to work 
on some death-survival insurance, 
but it won’t help us.”/ 

“I guess not,” Blaine said. 

The dream, for a moment, had 
been dazzling: a relief from mor- 
tal fears; the rational certainty of 
a continuance and existence after 
the body’s death; the knowledge 
of an uninterrupted process of 
growth and fulfillment for his per- 
sonality to its own limits— not the 
constricting limits of the frail fleshy 
envelope that heredity and chance 
had imposed on him. 

But that was not to be. His 
mind’s desire to expand was to be 
checked, rudely, finally. Tomor- 
row’s promises were forever not 
for today. 

“What about reincarnation and 
host bodies?” Blaine asked. 

“You should know,” Melhill 
told him. “They reincarnated you 
and put you in a host. There’s 
nothing complicated about mind- 
switching, as the Transplant 
operators will gladly tell you. 
Transplant is only temporary oc- 



cupancy, however, and doesn’t in- 
volve full dislodgement of the 
original mind. Hosting is for keeps. 
First, the original mind must be 
wiped out. Second, it’s a dangerous 
game for the mind attempting to 
enter the host body. Sometimes, 
you see, that mind can’t penetrate 
the host and breaks itself up try- 
ing. Hereafter conditioning often 
won’t stand up under a reincarna- 
tion attempt. If the mind doesn’t 
make it into the host— blooey!” 

T>LAINE nodded. He asked, 
“Why would any man with 
hereafter insurance still make the 
attempt at reincarnation?” 

“Because some old guys are 
afraid of dying,” Melhill said. 
“They’re afraid of the hereafter, 
scared of that spirit stuff. They 
want to stay right here on Earth 
where they know what’s what. So 
they buy a body legally on the 
open market, if they can find a 
good one. If not, they buy one 
on the black market. One of our 
bodies, pal.” 

“The bodies on the open market 
are offered for sale voluntarily?” 
“That’s right.” 

“But who would sell his body?” 
“A very poor guy, obviously. By 
law, he’s supposed to receive com- 
pensation in addition to hereafter 
insurance for his body. In actual 
fact, he takes what he can get.” 
“A man would have to be 
crazy!”

“You think so?” Melhill re- 
torted. “Today, like always, the 
world is filled with unskilled, sick, 
disease-ridden and starving people. 
And, like always, they all got fami- 
lies. Suppose a guy wants to buy 
food for his kids. His body is the 
only thing of value he has to sell. 
Back in your time, he didn’t have 
anything at all to sell.” 

“Perhaps so,” Blaine said. “But 
no matter how bad things got, I’d 
never sell my body.” 

Melhill laughed with easy good 
humor. “Stout fellow! But, Tom, 
they’re taking it for nothing!” 
Blaine could think of no an- 
swer for that.

^^IME passed slowly in the 
padded cell. Blaine and Mel- 
hill were given books and maga- 
zines. They were fed often and 
well, out of paper cups and plates. 
They were closely watched, for no 
harm must come to their highly 
marketable bodies. 

Blaine began to experience an 
exceeding fondness for the sturdy, 
thickset, well-muscled body he 
had acquired so recently, and 
from which he would be parted so 
soon. It was really an excellent 
body, he decided, a body to be 
proud of. True, it had no particu- 
lar grace; but grace could be over- 
estimated. 

On the whole, all considerations 



of mortality aside, it was not a 
body to be given up lightly. 

One day, after they had eaten, 
a padded section of wall swung 
away. Looking in, protected by 
steel bars, was Carl Ore. 

“Howdy,” said Ore, tall, lean, 
direct-eyed, angular in his city 
clothes, “how’s my Brazilian 
buddy?” 

“You louse,” Blaine said, with 
a deep sense of the inadequacy of 
words. 

“Them’s the breaks,” said Ore. 
“You boys gettin’ enough to eat?” 

“You and your ranch in 
Arizona!” 

“I’ve got one under option,” Ore 
said. “Mean to retire there some 
day and raise sandplants. I reckon 
I know more about Arizona than 
many a native-born son. But 
ranches cost money, and hereafter 
insurance costs money. A man does 
what he can.” 

“And a vulture does what he 
can,” Blaine snapped. 

Ore sighed deeply. “Well, it’s a 
business and I guess ifs worse 
than some others I could think of, 
if I set my mind to it kinda hard. 
I’ll probably regret all this some- 
time when I’m sitting on the front 
porch of my little desert ranch.” 

“You’ll never get there,” Blaine 
assured him. 

“I won’t?” 

“No. One night a mark is going 
to catch you spiking his drink. 
You’re going to end in the gutter, 



TIME KILLER

Ore, with your head caved in. 
And that’ll be the end of you.” 
“Only the end of my body,” Ore 
corrected. “My soul will march on 
to that sweet life in the by and by. 
I’ve paid my money, boy, and 
heaven’s my next home!” 

“You don’t deserve it!” 

grinned, and even Melhill 
couldn’t conceal a smile. Ore 
said, “My poor Brazilian friend, 
there’s no question of deserving. 
You should know better than that. 
Life after death just isn’t for the 
meek and humble little people, no 
matter how worthy they are. It’s 
the bright lad with the dollar in his 
pocket and his eyes open for num- 
ber one whose soul- marches on 
after death.” 

“I can’t believe it,” Blaine said. 
“It isn’t fair. It isn’t just.” 

“You’re an idealist,” said Ore 
interestedly, as though he were 
studying the world’s last specimen 
of the breed. 

“Call it what you like. Maybe 
you’ll get your hereafter. Ore. But 
I think there’s a tiny corner of 
it where you’ll burn forever!” 

Ore said, “There’s no scientific 
evidence of hell-fire. On the other 
hand, there’s a lot we don’t know 
about the hereafter. Maybe I’ll 
burn. And maybe there’s even a 
factory up there in the blue where 
they’ll reassemble your shattered 



mind . But let’s not argue. I’m 
sorry, I’m afraid the time’s come.” 

Ore walked quickly away. The 
steel-barred door swung open and 
five men marched into the room. 

“No!” Melhill screamed. 

They closed in on the space- 
man. Expertly they avoided his 
swinging fists and pinioned his 
arms. One of them pushed a gag 
in his mouth. They started to drag 
him out of the room. 

Ore appeared again in the door- 
way, frowning. “Let go of him,” 
he said. 

The men released Melhill. 

“You idiots got the wrong man,” 
Ore told them. “It’s that one.” He 
pointed at Blaine. 

Blaine had been trying to pre- 
pare himself for the loss of his 
friend. The abrupt reversal of for- 
tune caught him open-mouthed 
and unready. The men seized him 
before he had time to react. 

Blaine suddenly came to life 
and tried to wrench free. “I’ll kill 
you!” he shouted at Ore. “I swear 
it. I’ll kill you!” 

“Don’t damage him,” Ore said 
to the men, wooden-faced. 

A rag was pushed over Blaine’s 
mouth and nose, and he smelled 
something sickeningly sweet that 
fogged his mind. His last recol- 
lection was of Melhill, his face 
ashen, standing at the barred door.

Paramount Ulj 

By AVRAM DAVIDSON 

We were being tested, no doubt 
of it — but for what — and would 
it be a promotion if we passed? 



I T was the Russians’ own 
fault that they had picked 
that particular week to stage 
another walkout from the U.N. 
And, of course, all the Delegates 
of all the Peoples’ Democracies 
had trotted obediently out behind 
them. Later on, the Outer Mon- 
golians were to claim that Things 
Would Have Been Different If— 
But that is very doubtful. 

The vessel was spotted first 
from a fire observation tower in 
Yosemite, but by the time the 

illustrated by MARTINEZ 



United States government had be- 
gun to act, the visitors had made 
a second landing — in Central 
Park. For a while, it was believed 
that there were two ships, but 
gradually it came to be realized 
that there was only one, that it 
had shown up in New York City as 
near instantaneously after vanish- 
ing from California as made no 
difference. 

Prince Prhajhadiphong of Thai, 
his country’s Permanent Delegate, 
was enjoying his usual morning

stroll when he rounded a corner 
in the path and saw the two visi- 
tors emerging from the charcoal- 
colored oval. 

“Sunshine,” said one of them to 
the Prince, who could never after- 
ward recall which, an understand- 
able lapse, since they were 
identical twins. H.H. the P.D. was 
always rather a wag, and it was 
only with a strong effort that he re- 
strained himself from saying, 
“Moonshine,” in reply to the un- 
common greeting. 

“And Sunshine to you,” he said, 
bowing. The two men had kum- 
quat-colored complexions, their 
Lifebuoy-pink hair was worn in a 
double loop over the right ear, and 
their clothes glittered and tinkled. 

“Are you a person of conse- 
quence?” asked one, speaking as 
if he had (so the Prince thought 
to himself) a mouthful of hot rice. 

“Oh, of very small consequence,” 
the Prince murmured. 

The second one observed, in 
what seemed an approving man- 
ner, “You are evidently using the 
Modest Opposite. If you were in- 
deed what you say, then you 
would use the Assertive OpfXDsite 
to aggrandize yourself.” He turned 
to his twin. “Very early evidence 
of oviirb-tav, eh, Smottleb?” 

But Smottleb demurred. “Per- 
haps, Cumpaw, although he uses 
the Modest Opposite, it may be 
that he does so only to confuse 
us into thinking that he is really 



only of a small consequence. 
Which would be no evidence at 
all of ovUrb-tav, would it?” 

Smottleb considered this. Then 
he said, “Well, we must find out.” 
They turned to the patient Thai 
and said in unison, “Take us to 
your Paramount Ulj.” 

“Certainly,” said Prince Prhad- 
jhadiphong. 

As he led the way to a taxi, he 
reminded himself that, as one who 
had spent a year in Bangkok’s 
best Buddhist monastery, he should 
ever reflect that all is Maya, or il- 
lusion; and that Maya can take 
any form at all. 

^ I 'HE hastily created U.N. Com- 
mittee to Welcome Interstellar 
Visitors consisted of American 
Ambassador Stuyvesant Lowell 
Lee, Dr. Mithra Parseebhoee of 
India, and — of course — the 
Prince himself. 

“Which one of you is Para- 
mount Ulj?” asked Cumpaw (or 
perhaps it was Smottleb). 

“Hm,” said the Prince, coughing 
delicately. “We three are tem- 
porarily exercising the functions 
of the Paramount Uljency. You 
may confide in us.” 

“Ah, you have not yet held Or- 
deal and Combat to select the 
late Paramount’s successor, I as- 
sume. Well, well ... I share your 
darkness. Was the deceased a man 
of good taste?” Smottleb asked 
(unless it was Cumpaw). 



48 



GALAXY 



“Very,” said the Prince, as his 
colleagues hesitated. 

“Good. Then let us recline and 
talk,” one visitor said, “of our Pur- 
pose here.” 

Their devotion to the cause of 
ovlirb-tav can be gauged by the 
fact that Earth was the sixty-first 
planet the twins had visited — and 
of the other sixty, only two had 
shown a sufficient grasp of this 
principle, which alone separates 
Man from the beasts. 

“How to define this term?” one 
of them wondered aloud. “Polite- 
ness? Decency? Know-how? Civili- 
zation?” 

“If you have it,” the other said, 
“we share with you. Ever3rthing. 
We will have but one placenta, 
your people and ours — if you 
show ovlirb-tav. And if not, pusht! 
You may continue to cook in your 
own—” 

Ambassador Lee asked, perhaps 
incautiously, “And how is this 
quality shown?” 

He was informed that this would 
be learned soon enough. Pandit 
Parseebhoee suggested that Earth, 
too, might have something of value 
to share. 

“Only if you have ovlirb-tav,” 
said Smottleb or Cumpaw. “If not 
—smersh!” 

Prince P. inquired where their 
home planet was, and they loftily 
told him that it was so far away 
that even its sun was not known 
to him. 



“Ah, then you must have the 
Galactic Drive!” the Prince ex- 
claimed. They raised polite eye- 
brows. He said, “A means of trav- 
eling infinitely faster than the 
speed of light.” 

“Ho, this primitive device!” one 
of them said merrily. “No wonder 
you have not even reached your 
moon yet. Yop, yop, yop!” he 
chuckled. 

The Indian Delegate whispered 
to his American colleague, “For 
Heaven’s sake, do not let them 
see a newspaper or they will know 
at once that we have neither piety, 
politeness, nor civilization!” 

T> UT the ears of the aliens were 
sharp. “Newspaper?” one in- 
quired. “By all means, let us see 
one of your newspapers. It may 
help us.” 

The three committee members 
sat in a moody silence while Smott- 
leb and Cumpaw looked through 
the morning paper. 

‘“Teen-ager Slays Six With 
Pogo Stix’-” 

Stuyvesant Lowell Lee sweated, 
slumped. 

“Ah, this shows mettle and fettle, 
eh, Cumpaw?” 

Lee wiped his face on his sleeve, 
sat up. 

“ ‘Caste Riots in Bombay,’ ” the 
visitor continued. His tone this 
time was not pleased. 

The Pandit hid his eyes in his 
hand. 



PARAMOUNT ULJ

“You see, Smottleb: even here. 
I tell you it is the fault of the 
uterine aunts; they neglect their 
duties to the septs. I warned them 
at home after the last caste riots—” 
the Pandit dropped his hand, and, 
for a moment, was tempted to buff 
his fingernails — “but no, they 
wouldn’t listen. Make the uterine 
aunts responsible for all property 
damage and you will see a change. 
Pusht, yes!” 

They took up the pap>er again. 
“ ‘Coup in Thailand. Pibbulphum- 
phit ousts Pibbulpharphel’ ” 

Prince P.’s bright face went im- 
passive. 

“Ordeal and Combat for some 
territorial Ulj,” the visitor said 
indifferently, turning to another 
story. The Prince smiled, though 
a bit wanly. And suddenly there 
was a sound like the trilling of 
birds. 

“Smottleb here,” said Smottleb, 
putting his finger in one ear and 
seeming to listen. A startled look 
came over his face. “We shall re- 
turn at once,” he said. The two 
rose, spx>ke briefly in an alien 
tongue. 

“Bad news?” inquired one of the 
U.N. Delegates solicitously. 

“Our Paramount Ulj is dead.” 

The Thai said that he shared 
their darkness. 

“And well you may; he was 
our father,” Smottleb said. 

The three murmured condo- 
lences. 



“Will you be back after the 
funeral?” Ambassador Lee asked. 
The twins said they hopjed to. 
The Prince asked, “Do you 
practice cremation or burial?” 

As neither answered. Pandit 
Parseebhoee inquired, “Or per- 
haps you expx)se your, ah, loved 
ones?” 

Smottleb and Cumpaw looked 
at each other. 

“Pusht!” said one. 

“Smersh!” said the other. 

They folded their arms and 
vanished. 

By the time the car arrived in 
Central Park, there was no trace 
of the alien ship except a large 
crowd milling around and craning 
their necks at an empty sky, and 
several pxslicemen who rep>eated 
over and over again, “Cmahn, 
cmahn, keep awfadagrass . .” 
The American and Indian Dele- 
gates moaned simultaneously, “But 
what did we say?” Not even the 
usually cheerful Thai had anything 
to suggest. 

♦'■''HE New Paramount Ulj 
greeted the twins on their re- 
turn. “Sunshine . Nice of you to 
come back and all that.” 

“It was nothing. We congratu- 
late you,” said the brothers. 

The Paramount shrugged depre- 
catingly. “It was a lucky thrust 
through the spleen.” 

The brothers clappjed their 
hands admiringly. “We could not

have wished a better death for our 
father,” they said in ritual. 

Arm in arm with his successor, 
they went in for dinner. As they 
took seats, he said, “Well, and how 
was this mission? Any luck? Any 
signs of ovlirb-tav?" 

“Signs, yes,” said Smottleb, 
“but little more. Do you know, 
some of them expose their dead?” 

There was a general shaking of 
heads around the high table at 
this revelation. 

“And what is more,” Cumpaw 
confided, “others practice crema- 
tion.” 

The new Paramount said a trifle 
stiffly, “We can discuss that after 
dinner, if you don’t mind.” 



But his predecessor’s son con- 
tinued, as if eager to unburden 
himself, “And the rest of them, 
if you’ll credit me, actually bury 
their beloved dead!” 

There was a stifled shriek and 
the Dowager Concubine-Uljess was 
led away by two slave-girls, her 
napkin pressed tightly to her 
mouth. Just then, the Gentlemen- 
in-Waiting arrived with the food. 
All the guests fell to with good 
appetite. The late Paramount Ulj 
had been an old man, but he had 
always kept himself in good con- 
dition and— as everyone assured his 
proud sons — he was in excellent 
taste.

O NCE again, this is a col- 
umn based entirely on 
questions from the read- 
ers. And the readers, this time, 
have forced me to deviate from 
a private policy. That policy has 
been to avoid what might be called 
topics of the day.^ 

Topics of the day are for the 
daily newspapers and the weekly 
news magazines; a monthly maga- 
zine simply cannot keep pace. 

There are two reasons for mak- 
ing an exception. The topic itself 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



53 



— space travel — is dear to the 
heart and mind of every science 
fiction reader. And I also know 
from experience that a scientific 
event will receive big play in the 
newspapers when it is “news,” but 
while it is “news,” it is rarely com- 
plete. The final outcome, the sober 
and technical scientific report, will 
be published months or even years 
later and the average reader al- 
most never gets to see it. 

The news event which prompted 
quite a number of people to write 
to me (sending me newspapser 
clippings, headlines and editorials) 
and which prompts me to write 
these lines is the discovery of the 
so-called “radiation belt” around 
the Earth. I must caution every- 
body right now to accept the term 
“radiation belt” merely as a label. 
When more about it is known, it 
might be necessary to invent a 
different term for it. 

The beginning of the story was 
almost expressed in the title of 
a book and movie of several dec- 
ades ago. It could have been called 
“Explorer I Doesn’t Answer.” Ex- 
plorer I (or “1958 Alpha”) was 
neatly in orbit, transmitting data, 
and stopped transmitting. Then it 
started up again. Then it stopped. 

Somebody in Europe claimed 
to know that Sputnik II had 
done the same thing. From what 
we now know about the natural 
phenomenon involved, it probably 
did. 



By the time Explorer II went 
into orbit, scientists already had 
a suspicion. Vanguard I did not 
produce the same result, even 
though it is on a much larger orbit, 
simply because it is not instru- 
mented. Vanguard’s transmitter 
merely sings out that it is there. 

’ I ■' HE reason why Explorer I 
•*- stopped reporting from time 
to time was that its instruments 
were overloaded with radiation. 
And this happened from a certain 
distance on outward, the distance 
being tentatively given as 600 
miles from the ground. 

Now when the public hears that 
above 600 miles there is so much 
radiation that the instruments can- 
not handle it any more, it con- 
cludes that there must be danger. 
And when a scientist. Dr. James 
Van Allen, says that the amount 
of radiation was such that, in an 
hour or two, a man would get a 
radiation dose which is consid- 
ered the weekly safe limit, the 
public must conclude that humani- 
ty is planet-bound. Dr. Van Allen 
was the first to say that it isn’t 
so, but everybody seems to be 
sufficiently jittery about radia- 
tion to disregard the latter por- 
tion of the sentence. 

In reality, things are never as 
bad as some p>eople always say. 
But mostly they are much more 
complicated than most p>eople 
think. 



54 



GALAXY 



To clarify the picture, we have 
to enumerate quickly what t 3 T)es 
of radiation we are bound to en- 
counter in space — let’s say just 
above the atmosphere. There are, 
of course, all kinds of radiation 
from the Sun, radio waves, heat, 
visible light and even X-rays. 
These X-rays coming from the 
Sun are comparatively weak and 
are swallowed up by our atmos- 
phere; before the development of 
high-altitude research rockets, their 
existence was only suspected but 
not proved. 

Then there are the cosmic rays, 
which are just fast-moving nuclei 
of atoms. In most cases, they are 
protons, the nuclei of hydrogen 
atoms, simply because there are 
more hydrogen atoms in inter- 
planetary space than any other 
kind. Explorer I, incidentally, 
proved that the number of cos- 
mic rays is smaller than expected. 

Well, what about this “radia- 
tion belt”? 

I am going to say something 
now that will sound like an un- 
related theme to any but a physi- 
cist. 

In order to make X-rays, you 
first produce a vacuum which, on 
the ground, naturally has to be 
enclosed in a bulb or tube or else 
it won’t stay a vacuum. Through 
this vacuum, you shoot a stream 
of electrons. When these electrons 
hit a target, they produce X-rays. 
In the actual vacuum tube, the 



target is metal for various prac- 
tical reasons. But you would also 
get X-rays with, for instance, a 
graphite target. All that matters 
is that the electrons have a ma- 
terial target to hit. 

Now back to space, where you 
have a vacuum. There is no doubt 
that electrons are flying around 
through space. Now you put a 
metal satellite there. What you 
have done is to make the X-ray 
tube complete— there is now a 
target! 

The point is that space is not 
“full of X-rays” as one headline 
put it. As long as there is no 
target, there are no X-rays, except 
those coming from the Sun direct- 
ly. It is the satellite that makes 
the X-rays. 

’ I ''HIS, I have to admit, should 
have been concluded on theo- 
retical grounds beforehand. It just 
so happened that everybody was 
preoccupied with specific prob- 
lems, such as orbital velocities or 
the proper frequencies for tele- 
metering transmission and so fortii. 
If anybody said, in advance of the 
event, that an artificial satellite 
would act like the target in an 
X-ray tube, I did not see the state- 
ment. 

But why does this happen only 
above 600 miles, or whatever the 
correct figure may be? The pres- 
ent concept runs like this: 

These electrons in space come 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



55 



from the Sun. Every solar out- 
burst probably throws a shipload 
of them into space. If the Earth 
did not have a magnetic field, 
these electrons — or rather those 
that happen to hit the Earth— 
would simply enter the atmos- 
phere and become a part of it, 
possibly unnoticed. But the Earth’s 
magnetic field keeps them at a 
distance and they somehow ac- 
cumulate into what may be called 
clouds of electrons. Whether they 
assume a specific shape— say some- 
thing that would look like the 
rings of Saturn if it were visible 
—is not yet known. 

Other things still to be found 
out are the diameter of this area 
of high electron density, the thick- 
ness of this layer and its variations. 

The thickness of the layer is 
likely to vary with geographical 
latitude. And since the Sun is 
sometimes more active than at 
other times, there is likely to be 
a variation in density. One close- 
ly related side issue is the rela- 
tionship with the aurorae. It 
sounds probable now that a year 
of frequent and spectacular au- 
rorae is also a year of maximum 
density of this electron layer, or 
area, or stream. 

How does this discovery influ- 
ence space travel plans? 

It looks now as if a space sta- 
tion in a circular orbit more or 
less over the magnetic equator 
and not more than 500 miles 



above sea level would be safely 
below this electron aggregation. On 
the other hand, a spaceship bor- 
ing through it on its way to the 
Moon or to Mars would pass it 
so quickly that the X-rays pro- 
duced during passage could be 
neglected. 

Besides, even if it was too much 
for the instruments to handle, it 
is comparatively little if you have 
a “hot” atom laboratory in mind 
for comparison. The intensity 
could be cut to one-tenth of its 
value by a lead sheet one rriilli- 
meter thick. A ship could carry 
this if it were absolutely necessary. 
Just what will be necessary is 
something we don’t know yet. 

The main thing this discovery 
may do is change the choice for 
the best orbit for a manned per- 
manent space station. 

MAIL ON ATLANTIS 

^ I 'HE article about Atlantis and 
the theories of Pastor Spanuth

lot of letters. Several people cor-

is an English edition of the book. 
Well, even though it is at my ex- 
pense, I am happy to announce 
that an English edition exists, so 
that any of my readers who feel 
like it can check all the details. 

That the article was read care- 
fully is evidenced by the fact that 
one part of one sentence brought 



56 



GALAXY 



me a detailed linguistic discus- 
sion from Basil Davenport of the 
Book-of-the-Month Club. You 
may remember that I mentioned 
in passing that Plato’s name is 
(A) a nickname, since his real 
name was Aristokles, and (B) that 
the nickname was actually Platon, 
but that the final “n” has been 
lost in English, while French and 
Russian retain it. 

Well, the Maltster in Artibus 
Basil Davenport had something 
to say about it which I find inter- 
esting. The final “n” has been lost 
in English because we got this 
from the Latin. The point is that 
the Romans had names ending in 
“o,” like Cicero, but one of the 
grammatical forms derived from 
such a name would be Ciceronis. 
Now the Greeks had names like 
Platon with a corresponding form 
like Platonos. When the Romans 
dealt with a Greek name of this 
type, they always dropped the 
“n.” 

In Plato’s dialogues, Menon, 
Kriton and Phaidon thus became 
Meno, Crito and Phaedo. It was 
an attempt to assimilate these 
names, making them sound like 
Roman names of the type of 
Cicero, Scipio and Nero. Some 
people, I am forced to conclude, 
were “writing down” even then. 

Well, this explains why the 
“n” disappeared in Latin and, con- 
sequently and subsequently, in 
those languages that derived their 



learning from the Romans, like 
English and German. What struck 
me in Basil Davenport’s discus- 
sion is that the French, though 
they write “Platon,” did not really 
retain the “n.” They also got their 
Greek names via Latin, but tacked 
on an “n” almost everywhere — 
from the Latin accusative, Mr. 
Davenport believes. Yes, they do 
write Platon, which happens to 
look like the original Greek; but 
they also write Neron, Ciceron 
and Junon, adding an “n” where 
it certainly does not belong. 

As for the Russians, they prob- 
ably really retained the “n” since 
their early learning was strongly 
influenced by the Greeks directly 
— no Russian, to this day, has any 
trouble learning the Greek alpha- 
bet. His own alphabet is only an 
adaptation of the Greek. 

The correspondence about At- 
lantis ranged far and wide, one 
letter being concerned mainly with 
a geographical problem. The cor- 
respondent stated his problem 
quite tersely in one sentence by 
asking: did I agree with Spanuth’s 
interpretation of Kalypso’s sailing 
instructions? 

My answer was “No!” but I had 
better explain what this is about. 

"V" OU remember that Odysseus, 
after all kinds of hair-raising 
adventures, finally gets to a beau- 
tiful wooded island, the island of 
Kalypso. (Mustn’t annoy Mr.

Davenport by using the Roman 
spelling, Calypso; moreover, I like 
the spelling with a K better my- 
self.) There he sits at the shore 
for years and years, waiting to 
return to his home. Finally Kalyp- 
so, also prodded by a message 
which Hermes has brought, per- 
mits him to build a raft, telling 
him how to sail to reach the near- 
est land. 

The instructions are lines 270- 
279 in the fifth book of the Odys- 
sey. Odysseus is to steer by the 
Pleiades “and the autumn-setting 
Bootes” until, after seventeen days 
of sailing, he would see mountain- 
ous land. 

Following the “autumn-setting 
Bootes,” it was clear to every 
sailor, meant an easterly course, 
which also made sense because it 
had been told that Odysseus had 
sailed to the west before. It also 
became clear, the more the study 
of the Homeric poems progressed, 
that the poet had almost never 
made things up. Homer used tra- 
ditions, legends and actual (though 
probably oral ) reports and instruc- 
tions, just fitting them into his 
story line. This, of course, had the 
result that listeners recognized 
things and would nod their heads 
and think, “That’s correct.” In 
short, “Kalypso’s sailing instruc- 
tions” were suspected of being 
somebody’s actual sailing instruc- 
tions. The question was: from 
where to where? 



The goal, the Odyssey stated 
through many lines, was the city 
of Scheria, inhabited by the Phai- 
akians. Scheria, many archeolo- 
gists agreed, was likely to be Tar- 
tessos, located at the western shore 
of the Iberian peninsula. This idea 
was strengthened by the state- 
ments of the inhabitants as woven 
into the Odyssey, namely that they 
were “the farthest of mortals,” and 
similar references to their isolated 
location. What remained to be 
done was to go over the islands 
within a little over two weeks’ sail 
and see which one would fit the 
description. The answer was 
Madeira. 

Finally, Doctors Hennig and 
Erpelt in Germany reset a plane- 
tarium for the latitude of Madeira 
and the year 800 B.C., the most 
probable time of the writing of the 
Odyssey. The Pleiades and Bootes 
were seen to rise from very near- 
ly the same point in the east-north- 
east; Kalypwo’s sailing instructions 
fitted a voyage from Madeira to 
the corner of the Iberian main- 
land. 

Everybody was quite happy, 
but Pastor Spanuth explains this 
as a voyage from Madeira to his 
Atlantis, in the North Sea. He 
does have a reason, though it is 
one I consider weak. 

All through the portions of the 
poem where Odysseus is in the 
company of the Phaiakians, a 
physical difference is subtly 



58 



GALAXY 



stressed. Odysseus is instantly 
recognized as a foreigner. Several 
times it is said that the Phaiakians 
look “different,” but unfortunately 
it is never said in what way they 
looked different. (My personal 
suspicion is that Homer himself 
did not know, that he just knew 
from conversations with sailors 
that visitors to this far western 
city were always instantly recog- 
nized because they were of a dif- 
ferent type.) 

Since Odysseus had to be taken 
as a dark-haired Greek, presum- 
ably of the medium-tall lean type, 
there are really just two choices, 
since we can’t very well expect 
that Tartessos was a Chinese set- 
tlement. The Phaiakians must 
either have been much darker or 
much lighter than their Greek vis- 
itor. They could conceivably have 
been dark-skinned settlers from 
Africa. Or they could have been 
blond Europeans from the north. 

The latter seems more likely. 
There have been Negro cultures 
in the past, but they were not in 
the habit of spreading, whereas 
the North Europeans seem unable 
to sit still, even now. Pastor Span- 
uth also thinks that the Phaiakians 
of the Odyssey are meant to be 
light-skinned and light-haired 
Northerners, but instead of just 
supposing that they established a 
distant settlement, he tries to bring 
the hero of the Odyssey into their 
homeland. 



Well, as I already said, my an- 
swer was “No.” 

ANTI-MATTER AND 
ANTI-GRAVITY 

rpVEN if I did not read the 
daily papers myself, I could, 
quite often, deduce what stories 
have been published from the 
questions I get in my mail. Re- 
cently anti-matter and anti-gravity 
have been taking up some of the 
volume. 

The questions ranged from the 
simple question “What is anti- 
matter?” through the more in- 
volved question “Would anti-mat- 
ter be anti-gravitational?” to a 
request for instructions for build- 
ing an anti-gravity device. 

Anti-matter, which has been 
around in the newspapers lately, 
is what astronomers and science 
fiction readers have been know- 
ing for years under the name of 
contra-terrene matter or c-t. 

The theoretical existence of con- 
tra-terrene matter could be de- 
duced almost at once after the 
positron had been discovered. Here 
was a “counter particle”; logically 
there should be other counter par- 
ticles. The reasoning was actually 
quite simple; a hydrogen atom, 
for example, consists of a positive- 
ly charged proton as the nucleus 
with a negatively charged electron 
going around it. The charges of 
the two are equal, if opposite, but 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



59 



their masses are quite different, 
about 1840 to 1, with the electron 
at the small end. 

Then the positron was found, 
with a mass like that of the elec- 
tron, but positively charged. Now 
if there was a negatively charged 
proton (variously called “nega- 
tron” or “anti-proton”), you could 
have a hydrogen atom with the 
charges reversed. That would be 
contra-terrene matter, and it was 
also easy to postulate that if nor- 
mal matter and contra-terrene 
matter came together, they had to 
annihilate each other. 

But if you had the two kinds 
of matter safely isolated from 
each other by a large expanse of 
empty space, you would not be 
able, just by looking at them, to 
tell which kind they were. For 
example, contra-terrene copper 
probably would look like copper 
and conduct an electric current 
nicely. Contra-terrene iron would 
most likely be magnetic and sub- 
ject to rusting when exposed to 
contra-terrene oxygen. 

The news — and it isn’t so very 
new — is that anti-protons have 
now been produced in the labora- 
tory. 

They did not last long in 
their normal-matter environment, 
of course, but they lasted long 
enough to prove that they have 
real existence. 

So this is one part of the prob- 
lem. 



' I ^HE next one is whether a 
piece of normal matter and 
a piece' of contra-terrene matter 
would attract each other gravita- 
tionally. Or to give the question a 
more modern flavor: could a con- 
tra-terrene meteorite take up an 
orbit around the Earth? 

In my opinion: yes. Matter is 
matter, and just as a piece of con- 
tra-terrene iron would display in- 
ertia, would have its momentum 
(when in motion) calculated by 
the same formula and would be 
subject to centrifugal force under 
the proper conditions, it should 
also be subject to gravitational at- 
traction. We do not know what 
gravity really is, but it can be 
taken for granted that the mass of 
a body is somehow involved. Since 
contra-terrene matter must have 
mass, it must be within the law 
of gravity. 

This does not get us a single 
step closer to the riddle of gravity 
itself, which we cannot yet solve. 
The reason we can’t solve it right 
now is probably that we don’t have 
a valid theory about the nature 
of gravity. 

I know that there has been a 
lot of talk about anti-gravity re- 
search. But I also know that most 
of it is just that: talk. I know of 
one or two hoaxes. But I don’t 
know of any successes — provided 
anybody had any success, which I 
doubt. 

The reason I am bringing this 



60 



GALAXY 



up is that I have found a deep 
confusion about the issues in- 
volved. Just what do the people 
who hopefully talk about anti- 
gravity mean when they talk about 
it? Do they mean a body not 
subject to gravity — in short, a 
body which does not have any 
weight at all and which, if it really 
existed, would be squeezed out of 
the atmosphere by the weight of 
the air around it? Or do they 
mean a body which is actually 
repelled? 

Now let us make these two 
cases equal in assuming that the 
body is such a long distance from 
the Earth and also from the Sun 
that any gravitational influence 
of the normal kind would be 
negligible. At a distance of one 
light-year from the Sun, the be- 
havior of a body which just does 
not weigh anything, and of one 
which is repelled, would be pretty 
much the same. Now you want to 
do something with this body; it is, 
in fact, a spaceship and you want 
to go somewhere with it. So the 
co-pilot adjusts the fuel pumps 
and the captain pushes the firing 
button. And the rocket motor be- 
gins to work. Against what? 
Against the inertia of the ship. 

I can almost hear the anguished 
screams at this point. Yes, the 
body not subject to gravity would 
still have mass, and mass has iner- 
tia. Much of the anti-gravity talk 
is due to the convenient confusion 



betweeen weight and mass. So if 
somebody wants to aim for some- 
thing really useful, he should not 
aim for “anti-gravity” but for an 
inertialess drive. Which is some- 
thing entirely different. 

NOTE TO 

CORRESPONDENTS 

T KNOW from lecture experi- 
ence that the part of the lec- 
ture which the public likes best 
is the question and answer period, 
when everybody can get his pet 
problem off his chest. Well, we 
can do the same in Galaxy. But 
just as a lecture hall question and 
answer period has to be cut off at 
some point, so that not every 
question can be answered, we will 
have to have certain restrictions in 
Galaxy. 

In the first place, I do not — 
repeat NOT — promise to answer 
by mail. Fire your question at the 
editorial office, and if it is judged 
as being of sufficient public inter- 
est, it will be answered in the 
magazine. As far as feasible, I’ll 
send printed acknowledgments to 
show that the question has arrived. 

In the second place, please don’t 
ask unnecessary questions of the 
type I’ve gotten so frequently in 
the past, such as: “Why is our sun 
not the biggest star in the Uni- 
verse?” and “How does an air- 
plane fly?” and believe it or not 
“Which is heavier, gold or lead?”

The answers to these questions 
should have been (and maybe 
were, I don’t remember) No. 1: 
“Because it isn’t.” No. 2: “Go to 
your public library.” No. 3: “How 
about looking it up if you don’t 
know?” 

ADD: HAZARDS OF 
ROCKET RESEARCH 

TN conclusion, there are two 
stories I was told, both of 
which no doubt have a moral, 
though I am too busy right now 
to figure it out. 

The first story was told to me 
during an airplane ride by a well- 
known rocket engineer who works 
in California. His company main- 
tains a large rocket-motor test 
area not too far from Los Angeles; 
in fact, outraged Angelenos have 
accused them on occasion of shak- 
ing the foundations of their build- 
ings. 

Well, they had Redstone motors 
on the test stands. The fuel of the 
Redstone is no secret; like that 
of the V-2, it is watered alcohol 
on one side of the injection sys- 
tem, while liquid oxygen goes in 
the other side of the injection sys- 
tem. One motor, when on the test 
stand, showed strange fluctuations. 
One instant it roared to shake the 
mountains, the next instant it 
burned rather feebly. No rocket 
motor behaves that way because 
of something wrong in the motor 



itself. The blame lies somewhere 
in the system — and that is just 
the trouble, for the system is large 
and complicated. It could be a 
valve which does not stay open, 
although this is very unlikely. 

At any event, all the valves were 
checked first. Nothing wrong, 
which was what everybody had 
been afraid of. It meant that the 
flaw was somewhere in the fuel 
line. Strong men with large pipe 
wrenches went into action. No, 
the fuel line was clear. It must 
be the oxygen line. 

It was. 

At one knee in the oxygen line, 
the culprit was discovered. A field 
mouse, frozen stiff and very dead. 

That field mice might be a 
hazard to rocket testing was new 
in everybody’s book. But what 
really bothers the men is the 
question of how that field mouse 
managed to get into the oxygen 
line. It is bothersome, because if 
one mouse can do that, another 
one might. And they don’t like to 
take the pipes apart to fish dead 
mice out of the oxygen flow. 

^I^HE other story came to me 
from an Englishman — also 
during an airplane ride — even 
though Americans are concerned. 
The Americans in question are 
American airmen, stationed some- 
where in eastern France. Their 
planes are rather modern single- 
seater jet fighters. Naturally the 



62 



GALAXY 



planes were constantly kept in an 
operable condition, but they are 
not flown all the time. 

It has to be explained here that 
such an airplane has several air- 
intake pipes. One is for cabin air; 
others are for the purpose of acti- 
vating various flight instruments. 

One morning, a man servicing 
a plane found one of these air in- 
takes carefully plugged up with 
what looked to him like dried 
clay. He reported this to his su- 
perior officer. The officer passed 
it on to his superior, who reported 
it to Intelligence. Intelligence took 
the customary dim view of things, 
especially since only a week earlier 
another maintenance team had 
found a few instrument tubes 
plugged up with dry clay. 

Intelligence concluded that this 



might be sabotage by French Com- 
munists and went to work. Main- 
tenance, in the meantime, went to 
work too. Intelligence would prob- 
ably have wanted Maintenance to 
save the plugged tubes for evi- 
dence, but Maintenance was 
single-minded and considered it 
their job to keep those planes in 
fine condition. 

Maintenance squirted water 
into the plugged tubes and then at- 
tached a high-pressure air hose 
and opened the valve wide. A 
stream of wet mud came out of 
the plugged holes. The officer in 
charge looked at it curiously and 
saw things wiggle and squirm in 
the mud. 

The saboteurs had been caught: 
mud wasps!

Corners 

By FREDERIK POHL 
Illustrated by WOOD 



I 

T his is the way it hap- 
pened in the old days. Pay 
attention now. I’m not go- 
ing to repeat myself. 

There was this old man. A 



THE WIZARDS OF RUNG’S CORNERS 



65 



wicked one. Coglan was his name, 
and he came into Pung’s Corners 
in a solid-lead car. He was six 
feet seven inches tall. He attracted 
a lot of attention. 

Why? Why, because nobody 
had ever seen a solid-lead car be- 
fore. Nobody much had ever seen 
a stranger. It wasn’t usual. That 
was how Pung’s Corners was in the 
old days, a little pocket in the mid- 
dle of the desert, and nobody came 
there. There weren’t even' planes 
overhead, or not for a long time; 
but there had been planes just be- 
fore old man Coglan showed up. 
It made people nervous. 

Old man Coglan had snapping 
black eyes and a loose and lim- 
ber step. He got out of his car 
and slammed the door closed. It 
didn’t go tchik like a Volkswagen 
or per-clack like a Buick. It went 
woomp. It was heavy, since, as I 
mentioned, it was solid lead. 

“Boy!” he bellowed, standing in 
front of Pung’s Inn. “Come get my 
bags!” 

Charley Frink was the bellboy 
at that time — yes, the Senator. 
Of course, he was only fifteen years 
old then. He came out for Coglan’s 
bags and he had to make four 
trips. There was a lot of space in 
the back of that car, with its truck 
tires and double-thick glass, and 
all of it was full of baggage. 

While Charley was hustling the 
bags in, Coglan was parading back 
and forth on Front Street. He 



winked at Mrs. Churchwood and 
ogled young Kathy Flint. He 
nodded to the boys in front of the 
barber shop. He was a character, 
making himself at home like that. 

In front of Andy Grammis’s 
grocery store, Andy tipped his 
chair back. Considerately, he 
moved his feet so his yellow dog 
could get out the door. “He seems 
like a nice feller,” he said to Jack 
Tighe. (Yes, that Jack Tighe.) 

Jack Tighe stood in the shelter 
of the door and he was frowning. 
He knew more than any of the 
rest of them, though it wasn’t time 
to say anything yet. But he said: 
“We don’t get any strangers.” 

Andy shrugged. He leaned back 
in his chair. It was warm in the 
sun. 

“Pshaw, Jack,” he said. “Maybe 
we ought to get a few more. 
Town’s going to sleep.” He yawned 
drowsily. 

And Jack Tighe left him there, 
left him and started down the 
street for home, because he knew 
what he knew. 

A NYWAY, Coglan didn’t hear 
them. If he had heard, he 
wouldn’t have cared. It was old 
man Coglan’s great talent that he 
didn’t care what people had to say 
about him, and the others like him. 
He couldn’t have been what he 
was if that hadn’t been so. 

So he checked in at Pung’s Inn. 
“A suite, boy!” he boomed. “The 



66 



GALAXY 



best. A place where I can be com- 
fortable, real comfortable.” 

“Yes, sir, Mister—” 

“Coglan, boy! Edsel T. Coglan. 
A proud name at both ends, and 
I’m proud to wear it!” 

“Yes, sir, Mr. Coglan. Right 
away. Now let’s see.” He pored 
over his room ledgers, although, ex- 
cept for the Willmans and Mr. Car- 
penter when his wife got mad at 
him, there weren’t any guests, as 
he certainly knew. He pursed his 
lips. He said: “Ah, good! The 
bridal suite’s vacant, Mr. Coglan. 
I’m sure you’ll be very comfort- 
able there. Of course, it’s eight- 
fifty a day.” 

“The bridal suite it is, boy!” 
Coglan chucked the pen into its 
holder with a fencer’s thrust. He 
grinned like a fine old Bengal tiger 
with white crewcut hair. 

And there was something to grin 
about, in a way, wasn’t there? The 
bridal suite. That was funny. 

Hardly anybody ever took the 
bridal suite at Pung’s Inn, unlesss 
they had a bride. You only had 
to look at Coglan to know that he 
was a long way from taking a 
bride — a long way, and in the 
wrong direction. Tall as he was, 
snapping-eyed and straight-backed 
as he was, he was clearly on the 
far side of marrying. He was at 
least eighty. You could see it in 
his crepy skin and his gnarled 
hands. 

The room clerk whistled for 



Charley Frink. “Glad to have you 
with us, Mr. Coglan,” he said. 
“Charley’ll have your bags up in 
a jiffy. Will you be staying with 
us long?” 

Coglan laughed out loud. It was 
the laugh of a relaxed and confi- 
dent man. “Yes,” he said. “Quite 
long.” 

Now what did Coglan do when 
he was all alone in the bridal 
suite? 

Well, first he paid off the bell- 
boy with a ten-dollar bill. That 
surprised Charley Frink, all right. 
He wasn’t used to that kind of tip- 
ping. He went out and Coglan 
closed the door behind him in a 
very great good humor. 

Coglan was happy. 

S O he peered around, grinning 
a wolfs grin. He looked at the 
bathroom, with its stall shower and 
bright white porcelain. “Quaint,” 
he murmured. He amused himself 
with the electric lights, switching 
them on and off. “Delicious,” he 
said. “So manual.” In the living 
room of the suite, the main light 
was from an overhead six-point 
chandelier, best Grand Rapids 
glass. Two of the pendants were 
missing. “Ridiculous,” chuckled old 
Mr. Coglan, “but very, very sweet.” 
Of course, you know what he 
was thinking. He was thinking of 
the big caverns and the big ma- 
chines. He was thinking of the 
design wobblators and the bomb- 



THE WIZARDS OF PUNG’S CORNERS

shielded power sources, the self- 
contained raw material lodes and 
the unitized distribution pipelines. 
But I’m getting ahead of the story. 
It isn’t time to talk about those 
things yet. So don’t ask. 

Anyway, after old man Coglan 
had a good look around, he opened 
one of his bags. 

He sat down in front of the 
desk. 

He took a Kleenex out of 
his pocket and with a fastidious 
expression picked up the blotter 
with it, and dumped it on the floor. 

He lifted the bag onto the bare 
desk top and propped it, open, 
against the wall. 

You never saw a bag like that! 
It looked like a kind of electronic 
tool kit, I swear. Its back was a 
panel of pastel lucite with sparks 
embedded in it. It glittered. There 
was a cathode screen. There was 
a scanner, a microphone, a speak- 
er. All those things and lots more. 
How do I know this? Why, it’s 
all written down in a book called 
My Eighteen Years at Fung’s Hall, 
by Senator C. T. Frink. Because 
Charley was in the room next door 
and there was a keyhole. 

So then what happened was 
that a little tinkly chime sounded 
distantly within the speaker, and 
the cathode screen flickered and 
lit up. 

“Coglan,” boomed the tall old 
man. “Reporting in. Let me speak 
to V. P. Maffity.” 



IVT OW you have to know what 
^ ’ Pung’s Corners was like in 
those days. 

Everybody knows what it is 
now, but then it was small. Very 
small. It sat on the bank of the 
Delaware River like a fat old lady 
on the edge of a spindly chair. 

General “Retreating Johnnie” 
Estabrook wintered there before 
the Battle of Monmouth and wrote 
pettishly to General Washington: 
“I can obtain no Provision here, 
as the inhabitants are so averse to 
our Cause, that I cannot get a 
Man to come near me.” 

During the Civil War, a small 
draft riot took place in its main 
square, in which a recruiting col- 
onel of the IXth Volunteer Penn- 
sylvania Zouaves was chased out 
of town and the son of the town’s 
leading banker suffered superficial 
scalp wounds. (He fell off his 
horse. He was drunk.) 

These were only little wars, you 
know. They had left only little 
scars. 

Pung’s Corners missed all the 
big ones. 

For instance, when the biggest 
of all got going, why, Pung’s Cor- 
ners had a ticket on the fifty-yard 
line but never had to carry the 
ball. 

The cobalt bomb that annihi- 
lated New Jersey stopped short 
at the bank of the Delaware, 



68 



GALAXY 



checked by a persistent easterly 
wind. 

The radio-dust that demolished 
Philadelphia went forty-some miles 
up the river. Then the drone that 
was spreading it was rammed 
down by a suicide pilot in a shaky 
jet. (Pung’s Corners was one mile 
farther on.) 

The H-bombs that scattered 
around the New York megalopolis 
bracketed Pung’s Corners, but it 
lay unscathed between. 

You see how it was? They never 
laid a glove on us. But after the 
war, we were marooned. 

Now that wasn’t a bad way to 
be, you know? Read some of the 
old books, you’ll see. The way 
Pung’s Corners felt, there was a 
lot to be said for being marooned. 
People in Pung’s Corners were 
genuinely sorry about the war, with 
so many people getting killed and 
all. (Although we won it. It was 
worse for the other side.) But 
every cloud has its silver lining 
and so on, and being surrounded 
at every point of the compass by 
badlands that no one could cross 
had a few compensating features. 

There was a Nike battalion in 
Pung’s Corners, and they say they 
shot down the first couple of heli- 
copters that tried to land because 
they thought they were the enemy. 
Maybe they did. But along about 
the fifth copter, they didn’t think 
that any more, I guarantee. And 
then the planes stopped coming. 



Outside, they had plenty to think 
about, I suppose. They stopped 
bothering with Pung’s Corners. 

Until Mr. Coglan came in. 

A FTER Coglan got his line of 
communication opened up — 
because that was what the big suit- 
case was, a TV communications 
set — he talked for a little while. 
Charley had a red dent on his 
forehead for two days, he pressed 
against the doorknob so hard, try- 
ing to see. 

“Mr. Maffity?” boomed Coglan, 
and a pretty girl’s face lighted up 
on the screen. 

“This is Vice President Maffi- 
ty’s secretary,” she said sweetly. 
“I see you arrived safely. One mo- 
ment, please, for Mr. Maffity.” 

And then the set flickered and 
another face showed up, the blood 
brother to Coglan’s own. It was the 
face of an elderly and successful 
man who recognized no obstacles, 
the face of a man who knew what 
he wanted and got it. “Coglan, 
boy! Good to see you got there!” 

“No sweat, L.S.,” said Coglan. 
“I’m just about to secure my logis- 
tics. Money. This is going to take 
money.” 

“No trouble?” 

“No trouble. Chief. I can prom- 
ise you that. There isn’t going to 
be any trouble.” He grinned and 
picked up a nested set of little 
metallic boxes out of a p>ouch in 
the suitcase. He ofiened one, shook

out a small disk-shaped object, 
silver and scarlet plastic. “I’m using 
this right away.” 

“And the reservoir?” 

“I haven’t checked yet, Chief. 
But the pilots said they dumped 
the stuff in. No opposition from 
the ground either, did you notice 
that? Tljese people used to shoot 
down every plane that came near. 
They’re softening. They’re ripe.” 
“Good enough,” said L. S. Maf- 
fity from the little cathode screen. 
“Make it so, Coglan. Make it so.” 

TV OW, at the Shawanganunk Na- 
’ tional Bank, Mr. LaFarge 
saw Coglan come in and knew 
right away something was up. 

How do I know that? Why, 
that’s in a book too. The Federal 
Budget and How I Balanced It: 
A Study in Surplus Dynamics, by 
Treasury Secretary (Retired) Wil- 
bur Otis LaFarge. Most every- 
thing is in a book, if you know 
where to look for it. That’s some- 
thing you young people have got 
to learn. 

Anyway, Mr. LaFarge, who was 
then only an Assistant Vice Presi- 
dent, greeted old man Coglan ef- 
fusively. It was his way. “Morn- 
ing, sir!” he said. “Morning! In 
what way can we serve you here 
at the bank?” 

“We’ll find a way,” promised 
Mr. Coglan. 

“Of course, sir. Of course!” Mr. 
LaFarge rubbed his hands. “You’ll 



want a checking account Certain- 
ly! And a savings account? And a 
safety deposit box? Absolutely! 
Christmas Club, I suppose. Per- 
haps a short-term auto loan, or a 
chattel loan on your household ef- 
fects for the purpose of consolidat- 
ing debts and reducing—” 

“Don’t have any debts,” said 
Coglan. “Look,what’s-your-name— ” 
“LaFarge, sir! Wilbur LaFarge. 
Call me Will.” 

“Look, Willie. Here are my 
credit references.” And he spilled 
a manila envelope out on the desk 
in front of LaFarge. 

The banker looked at the papers 
and frowned. He picked one up. 
“Letter of credit,” he said. “Some 
time since I saw one of those. 
From Danbury, Connecticut, eh?” 
He shook his head and pouted. “All 
from outside, sir.” 

“I’m from outside.” 

“I see.” LaFarge sighed heavily 
after a second. “Well, sir, I don’t 
know. What is it you wanted?” 
“What I want is a quarter of 
a million dollars, Willie. In cash. 
And make it snappy, will you?” 
Mr. LaFarge blinked. 

You don’t know him, of course. 
He was before your time. You 
don’t know what a request like 
that would do to him. 

When I say he blinked, I mean, 
man, he blinked. Then he blinked 
again and it seemed to calm him. 
For a moment, the veins had be- 
gun to stand out in his temples; for 



70 



GALAXY 



a moment, his mouth was open to 
speak. But he closed his mouth 
and the veins receded. 

TJECAUSE, you see, old man 
Coglan took that silvery, scar- 
let thing out of his pocket. It glit- 
tered. He gave it a twist and he 
gave it a certain kind of squeeze, 
and it hummed, a deep and throb- 
bing note. But it didn’t satisfy Mr. 
Coglan. 

“Wait a minute,” he said, off- 
handedly, and he adjusted it and 
squeezed it again. “That’s better,” 
he said. 

The note was deeper, but still 
not quite deep enough to suit Cog- 
lan. He twisted the top a fraction 
more, until the pulsing note was 
too deep to be heard, and then he 
nodded. 

There was silence for a second. 

Then: “Large bills?” cried Mr. 
LaFarge. “Or small?” He leaped 
up and waved to a cashier. “Two 
hundred and fifty thousand dol- 
lars! You there, Tom Fairleigh! 
Hurry it up now. What? No, I 
don’t care where you get it. Go out 
to the vault, if there isn’t enough 
in the cages. But bring me two 
hundred and fifty thousand dol- 
lars!” 

He sank down at his desk again, 
panting. “I am really sorry, sir,” he 
apologized to Mr. Coglan. “The 
clerks you get these days! I almost 
wish that old times would come 
back.” 



“Perhaps they will, friend,” said 
Coglan, grinning widely to himself. 
“Now,” he said, not unkindly, 
“shut up.” 

He waited, tapping the desk 
top, humming to himself, staring at 
the blank wall. He completely 
ignored Mr. LaFarge until Tom 
Fairleigh and another teller brought 
four canvas sacks of bills. They 
began to dump them on the desk 
to count them. 

“No, don’t bother,” said Coglan 
cheerfully, his black eyes snapping 
with good humor. “I trust you.” 
He picked up the sacks, nodded 
courteously to Mr. LaFarge, and 
walked out. 

Ten seconds later, Mr. LaFarge 
suddenly shook his head, rubbed 
his eyes and stared at the two tel- 
lers. “What-” 

“You just gave him a quarter of 
a million dollars,” said Tom Fair- 
leigh. “You made me get it out 
of the vault.” 

“I did?” 

“You did.” 

They looked at each other. 

Mr. LaFarge said at last: “It’s 
been a long time since we had any 
of that in Pung’s Corners.” 

Ill 

I^OW I have to tell a part that 

” isn’t so nice. It’s about a girl 
named Marlene Groshawl;. I posi- 
tively will not explain any part of 
it. I probably shouldn’t mention it 



THE WIZARDS OF RUNG'S CORNERS

at all, but it’s part of the history 
of our country. Still- 

Well, this is what happened. 
Yes, it’s in a book too— On Call, 
by One Who Knows. (And we 
know who “One Who Knows” is, 
don’t we?) 

She wasn’t a bad girl. Not a bit 
of it. Or, an 3 Tway, she didn’t mean 
to be. She was too pretty for her 
own good and not very smart. 
What she wanted out of life was 
to be a television star. 

Well, that was out of the ques- 
tion, of course. We didn’t use live 
television at all in Pung’s Corners 
those days, only a few old tapes. 
They left the commercials in, al- 
though the goods the old, dead an- 
nouncers were trying to sell were 
not on the market an 3 rwhere, much 
less in Pung’s Corners. And Mar- 
lene’s idol was a TV saleslady 
named Betty Furness. Marlene 
had pictures of her, dubbed off the 
tapes, pasted all over the walls of 
her room. 

At the time I’m talking about, 
Marlene called herself a public 
stenographer. There wasn’t too 
much demand for her services. 
(And later on, after things opened 
up, she gave up that part of her 
business entirely.) But if anybody 
needed a little extra help in Pung’s 
Corners, like writing some letters 
or getting caught up on the back 
filing and such, they’d call on Mar- 
lene. She’d never worked for a 
stranger before. 



She was rather pleased when the 
desk clerk told her that there 
was this new Mr. Coglan in town, 
and that he needed an assistant to 
help him run some new project he 
was up to. She didn’t know what 
the project was, but I have to tell 
you that if she knew, she would 
have helped anyhow. Any budding 
TV star would, of course. 

She stopped in the lobby of 
Pung’s Inn to adjust her makeup. 
Charley Frink looked at her with 
that kind of a look, in spite of 
being only fifteen. She sniffed at 
him, tossed her head and proudly 
went upstairs. 

She tapped on the carved oak 
door of Suite 41 — that was the 
bridal suite; she knew it well — 
and smiled prettily for the tall 
old man with snapping eyes who 
swung it open. 

“Mr. Coglan? I’m Miss Gro- 
shawk, the public stenographer. I 
understand you sent for me.” 

The old man looked at her 
piercingly for a moment. 

“Yes,” he said, “I did. Come in.” 

He turned his back on her and 
let her come in and close the door 
by herself. 

Coglan was busy. He had the 
suite’s television set in pieces all 
over the floor. 

He was trying to fix it some 
way or another, Marlene judged. 
And that was odd, mused Marlene 
in her cloudy young way, because 
even if she wasn’t really brainy, 



72 



GALAXY 



she knew that he was no tele- 
vision repairman, or anything like 
that. She knew exactly what he 
was. It said so on his card, and 
Mr. LaFarge had shown the card 
around town. He was a research 
and development counselor. 
Whatever that was. 

IV/r ARLENE was conscientious, 
and she knew that a good 
public stenographer took her tem- 
porary employer’s work to heart. 
She said: “Something wrong, Mr. 
Coglan?” 

He looked up, irritable. “I can’t 
get Danbury on this thing.” 

“Danbury, Connecticut? Out- 
side? No, sir. It isn’t supposed to 
get Danbury.” 

He straightened up and looked 
at her. “It isn’t supposed to get 
Danbury.” He nodded thoughtful- 
ly. “This forty-eight-inch twenty- 
seven tube full-color suppressed 
sideband UHF-VHF General Elec- 
tric wall model with static suppres- 
sors and self-compensating tuning 
strips, it isn’t supposed to get Dan- 
bury, Connecticut.” 

“That’s right, sir.” 

“Well,” he said, “that’s going to 
be a big laugh on the cavern in 
Schenectady.” 

Marlene said helpfully; “It 
hasn’t got any antenna.” 

Coglan frowned and corrected 
her. “No, that’s impossible. It’s got 
to have an antenna. These leads 
go somewhere.” 



Marlene shrugged attractively. 

He said: “Right after the war, of 
course, you couldn’t get Danbury 
at all. I agree. Not with all those 
fission products, eh? But that’s 
down to a negligible count now. 
Danbury should come in loud and 
clear.” 

Marlene said: “No, it was after 
that. I used to, uh, date a fellow 
named Timmy Horan, and he was 
in that line of business, making 
television repairs, I mean. A couple 
years after the war, I was just a 
kid, they began to get pictures 
once in a while. Well, they passed 
a law, Mr. Coglan.” 

“A law?” His face looked sud- 
denly harsh. 

“Well, I think they did. Any- 
way, Timmy had to go around 
taking the antennas off all the sets. 
He really did. Then they hooked 
them up with TV tape recorders, 
like.” She thought hard for a sec- 
ond. “He didn’t tell me why,” she 
volunteered. 

“I know why,” he said flatly. 

“So it only plays records, Mr. 
Coglan. But if there’s an5dhing 
you want, the desk clerk’ll get it 
for you. He’s got lots. Dinah 
Shores and Jackie Gleasons and 
Medic. Oh, and Westerns. You tell 
him what you want.” 

“I see.” Coglan stood there for 
a second, thinking. Not to her but 
to himself, he said: “No wonder 
we weren’t getting through. Well, 
we’ll see about that.” 



THE WIZARDS OF RUNG’S CORNERS 



73 



“What, Mr. Coglan?” 

“Never mind, Miss Groshawk. 
I see the picture now. And it isn’t 
a very pretty one.” 

He went back to the television 
set. 

He wasn’t a TV mechanic, no, 
but he knew a little something 
about what he was doing for sure, 
because he had it all back together 
in a minute. Oh, less than that. 
And not just the way it was. He 
had it improved. Even Marlene 
could see that. Maybe not im- 
proved, but different; he’d done 
something to it. 

“Better?” he demanded, looking 
at her. 

“I beg your pardon?” 

“I mean does looking at the pic- 
ture do anything to you?” 

“I’m sorry, Mr. Coglan, but I 
honestly don’t care for Studio One. 
It makes me think too hard, you 
know?” 

But she obediently watched the 
set. 

TTE had tuned in on the re- 
corded wire signal that went 
out to all of Pung’s Corners TV 
sets. I don’t suppose you know 
how we did it then, but there was 
a central station where they ran 
off a show all the time, for people 
who didn’t want to bother with 
tapes. It was all old stuff, of course. 
And everybody had seen all of 
them already. 

But Marlene watched, and fun- 



nily, in a moment she began to 
giggle. 

“Why, Mr. Coglan,” she said, 
though he hadn’t done an5rthing at 
all. 

“Better,” he said, and he was 
satisfied. 

He had every reason to be. 

“However,” said Mr. Coglan, 
“first things come first. I need your 
help.” 

“All right, Mr. Coglan,” Marlene 
said in a silky voice. 

“I mean in a business way. I 
want to hire some p>eople. I want 
you to help me locate them, and 
to keep the records straight. Then 
I shall need to buy certain ma- 
terials. And I’ll need an office, per- 
haps a few buildings for light in- 
dustrial purposes, and so on.” 

“That will take a lot of money, 
won’t it?” 

Coglan chuckled. 

“Well, then,” said Marlene, satis- 
fied, “I’m your girl, Mr. Coglan. 
I mean in a business way. Would 
you mind telling me what the busi- 
ness is?” 

“I intend to put Pung’s Corners 
back on its feet.” 

“Oh, sure, Mr. Coglan. But how, 
I mean?” 

“Advertising,” said old man Cog- 
lan, with a devil’s smile and a 
demon’s voice. 

Silence. There was a moment 
of silence. 

Marlene said faintly: “I don’t 
think they’re going to like it.” 



74 



GALAXY 



“Who?” 

“The bigwigs. They aren’t going 
to like that. Not advertising, you 
know. I mean I’m for you. I’m in 
favor of advertising. I like it. But—” 
“There’s no question of liking - 
it!” Coglan said in a terrible voice. 
“It’s what has made our coimtry 
great! It tooled us up to fight in 
a great war, and when that war 
was over, it put us back together 
again!” 

UT UNDERSTAND that, Mr. 

Coglan,” she said. “But—” 

“I don’t want to hear that word 
from you. Miss Groshawk,” he 
snapped. “There is no question. 
Consider America after the war, 
ah? You don’t remember, perhaps. 
They kept it from you. But the 
cities all were demolished. The 
buildings were ruins. It was only 
advertising that built them up 
again— advertising, and the power 
of research! For I remind you of 
what a great man once said: ‘Our 
chief job in research is to keep the 
customer reasonably dissatisfied 
with what he has.’” 

Coglan paused, visibly affected. 
“That was Charles F. Kettering 
of General Motors,” he said, “and 
the beauty of it. Miss Groshawk, 
is that he said this in the Twen- 
ties! Imagine! So clear a percep- 
tion of what Science means to all 
of us. So comprehensive a grasp 
of the meaning of American Inven- 
tiveness!” 



Marlene said brokenly: “That’s 
beautiful.” 

Coglan nodded. “Of course. So, 
you see, there is nothing at all that 
your bigwigs can do, like it or 
not. We Americans— we real Amer- 
icans — know that without adver- 
tising there is no industry; and 
accordingly we have shaped ad- 
vertising into a tool that serves us 
well. Why, here, look at that tele- 
vision set!” 

Marlene did, and in a moment 
began again to giggle. Archly she 
whispered: “Mr. Coglan!” 

“You see? And if that doesn’t 
suffice, well, there’s always the 
law. Let’s see what the bigwigs of 
Pung’s Corners can do against 
the massed might of the United 
States Army!” 

“I do hope there won’t be any 
fighting, Mr. Coglan.” 

“I doubt there will,” he said sin- 
cerely. “And now to work, eh? 
Or—” he glanced at his watch and 
nodded— “after all, there’s no real 
hurry this afternoon. Suppose we 
order some dinner, just for the two 
of us. And some wine? And—” 

“Of course, Mr. Coglan.” 
Marlene started to go to the 
telephone, but Mr. Coglan stopped 
her. 

“On second thought. Miss Gro- 
shawk,” he said, beginning to 
breathe a little hard, “I’ll do the 
ordering. You just sit there and 
rest for a minute. Watch the tele- 
vision set, eh?”

IV 



N ow I have to tell you about 
Jack Tighe. 

Yes, indeed. Jack Tighe. The 
Father of the Second Republic. 
Sit tight and listen and don’t in- 
terrupt, because what I have to 
tell you isn’t exactly what you 
learned in school. 

The apple tree? No, that’s only 
a story. It couldn’t have happened, 
you see, because apple trees don’t 
grow on upp>er Madison Avenue, 
and that’s where Jack Tighe spent 
his youth. Because Jack Tighe 
wasn’t the President of the Second 
Republic. For a long time, he was 
something else, something called 
V.P. in charge of S.L. division, of 
the advertising firm of Yust and 
Ruminant. 

That’s right. Advertising. 

Don’t cry. It’s all right. He’d 
given it up, you see, long before— 
oh, long before, even before the 
big war; given it up and come to 
Pung’s Corners, to retire. 

Jack Tighe had his place out on 
the marshland down at the bend 
of the Delaware River. It wasn’t 
particularly healthy there. All the 
highlands around Pung’s Corners 
drained into the creeks of that 
part of the area, and a lot of radio- 
activity had come down. But it 
didn’t bother Jack Tighe, because 
he was too old. 

He was as old as old man Cog- 
lan, in fact. And what’s more, they 



had known each other, back at the 
agency. 

Jack Tighe was also big, not 
as big as Coglan but well over six 
feet. And in a way he looked like 
Coglan. You’ve seen his pictures. 
Same eyes, same devil-may-care 
bounce to his walk and snap to his 
voice. He could have been a big 
man in Pung’s Corners. They 
would have made him mayor any 
time. But he said he’d come there 
to retire, and retire he would; 
it would take a major upheaval to 
make him come out of retirement, 
he said. 

And he got one. 

^^HE first thing was Andy Gram- 
mis, white as a sheet. 

“Jack!” he whispered, out of 
breath at the porch steps, for he’d 
run almost all the way from his 
store. 

Jack Tighe took his feet down 
off the porch rail. “Sit down, 
Andy,” he said kindly. “I suppose 
I know why you’re here.” 

“You do. Jack?” 

“I think so.” Jack Tighe nodded. 
Oh, he was a handsome man. He 
said : “Aircraft dumping neoscopal- 
amine in the reservoir, a stranger 
turning up in a car with a sheet- 
lead body. And we all know what’s 
outside, don’t we? Yes, it has to 
be that.” 

”It’s him, all right,” babbled 
Andy Grammis, plopping himself 
down on the steps, his face chalk. 



76 



GALAXY 



“It’s him and there’s nothing we 
can do! He came into the store this 
morning. Brought Marlene with 
him. We should have done some- 
thing about that girl. Jack. I knew 
she’d come to no good—” 

“What did he want?” 

“Want? Jack, he had a pad and 
a pencil like he wanted to take 
down orders, and he kept asking 
for — asking for — ‘Breakfast foods,’ 
he says, ‘whafve you got in the 
way of breakfast foods?’ So I told 
him. Oatmeal and corn flakes. 
Jack, he flew at me! ‘You don’t 
stock Coco-Wheet?’ he says. ‘Or 
Treats, Elets, Neets or Elixo- 
Wheets? How about Hunny-Yum- 
mies, or Prune-Bran Whippets, 
The Cereal with the Zip-Gun in 
Every Box?’ ‘No, sir,’ I tell him. 

“But he’s mad by then. ‘Pota- 
toes?’ he hollers. ‘What about po- 
tatoes?’ Well, we’ve got plenty of 
potatoes, a whole cellar full. But 
I tell him and that doesn’t satisfy 
him. ‘Raw, you mean?’ he yells. 
‘Not Tatar - Fluff, Pre - Skortch 
Mickies or Uncle Everett’s Con- 
verted Spuds?’ And then he shows 
me his card.” 

“I know,” said Jack Tighe kind- 
ly, for Grammis seemed to find it 
hard to go on. “You don’t have 
to say it, if you don’t want to.” 
“Oh, I can say it all right, Jack,” 
said Andy Grammis bravely. ‘This 
Mr. Coglan, he’s an adver— ” 
“No,” said Jack Tighe, stand- 
ing up, “don’t make yourself do it. 



It’s bad enough as it is. But it had 
to come. Yes, count it that it had 
to come, Andy. We’ve had a few 
good years, but we couldn’t expect 
them to last forever.” 

“But what are we going to do?" 
“Get up, Andy,” said Jack Tighe 
strongly. “Come inside! Sit down 
and rest yourself. And I’ll send for 
the others.” 

“You’re going to fight him? But 
he has the whole United States 
Army behind him.” 

Old Jack Tighe nodded. “So he 
has, Andy,” he said, but he seemed 
wonderfully cheerful. 

J ACK Tighe’s place was a sort 
of ranch house, with fixings. 
He was a great individual man. 
Jack Tighe was. All of you know 
that, because you were taught it 
in school; and maybe some of you 
have been to the house. But it’s 
different now; I don’t care what 
they say. The furniture isn’t just 
the same. And the grounds — 
Well, during the big war, of 
course, that was where the radio- 
dust drained down from the hills, 
so nothing grew. They’ve prettied 
it up with grass and trees and flow- 
ers. Flowers! I’ll tell you what’s 
wrong with that. In his young days. 
Jack Tighe was an account execu- 
tive on the National Floral ac- 
count. Why, he wouldn’t have a 
flower in the house, much less 
plant and tend them. 

But it was a nice house, all the 



THE WIZARDS OF RUNG’S CORNERS

same. He fixed Andy Grammis 
a drink and sat him down. He 
phoned downtown and invited half 
a dozen people to come in to see 
them. He didn’t say what it was 
about, naturally. No sense in start- 
ing a panic. 

But everyone pretty much knew. 
The first to arrive was Timmy 
Horan, the fellow from the tele- 
vision service, and he’d given Char- 
ley Frink a ride on the back of 
his bike. He said, breathless: “Mr. 
Tighe, they’re on our lines. I don’t 
know how he’s done it, but Cog- 
lan is transmitting on our wire 
TV circuit. And the stuff he’s 
transmitting, Mr. Tighe!” 

“Sure,” said Tighe soothingly. 
“Don’t worry about it, Timothy. 
I imagine I know what sort of 
stuff it is, eh?” 

He got up, humming pleasant- 
ly, and snapped on the television 
set. “Time for the afternoon 
movie, isn’t it? I suppose you left 
the tapes running.” 

“Of course, but he’s interfering 
with it!” 

Tighe nodded. “Let’s see.” 

The picture on the TV screen 
quavered, twisted into slanting 
lines of pale dark and snapped into 
shape. 

“I remember that one!” Charley 
Frink exclaimed. “It’s one of my 
favorites, Timmy!” 

On the screen. Number Two 
Son, a gun in his hand, was back- 
ing away from a hooded killer. 



Number Two Son tripped over a 
loose board and fell into a vat. 
He came up grotesquely comic, 
covered with plaster and mud. 

Tighe stepped back a few paces. 
He spread the fingers of one hand 
and moved them rapidly up and 
down before his eyes. 

“Ah,” he said, “yes. See for your- 
self, gentlemen.” 

Andy Grammis hesitatingly 
copied the older man. He spread 
his fingers and, clumsily at first, 
moved them before his eyes, as 
though shielding his vision from 
the cathode tube. Up and down 
he moved his hand, making a sort 
of stroboscope that stopped the 
invisible flicker of the racing elec- 
tronic pencil. 

And, yes, there it was! 

S EEN without the stroboscope, 
the screen showed bland- 
faced Charlie Chan in his white 
Panama hat. But the stroboscope 
showed something else. Between 
the consecutive images of the old 
movie there was another image — 
flashed for only a tiny fraction 
of a second, too quick for the 
conscious brain to comprehend, 
but, oh, how it struck into the sub- 
conscious! 

Andy blushed. 

“That — that girl,” he stam- 
mered, shocked. “She hasn’t got 
any—” 

“Of course she hasn’t,” said 
Tighe pleasantly. “Subliminal com-

pulsion, eh? The basic sex drive; 
you don’t know you’re seeing it, 
but the submerged mind doesn’t 
miss it. No. And notice the box of 
Prune-Bran Whippets in her hand.” 

Charley Frink coughed. “Now 
that you mention it, Mr. Tighe,” 
he said, “I notice that I’ve just 
been thinking how tasty a dish 
of Prune-Bran Whippets would be 
right now.” 

“Naturally,” agreed Jack Tighe. 
Then he frowned. “Naked women, 
yes. But the female audience 
should be appealed to also. I won- 
der.” He was silent for a couple 
of minutes, and held the others 
silent with him, while tirelessly he 
moved the spread hand before his 
eyes. 

Then he blushed. 

“Well,” he said amiably, “that’s 
for the female audience. It’s all 
there. Subliminal advertising. A 
product, and a key to the basic 
drives, and all flashed so quickly 
that the brain can’t organize its 
defenses. So when you think of 
Prune-Bran WhipF>ets, you think 
of sex. Or more important, when 
you think of sex, you think of 
Prune-Bran Whippets.” 

“Gee, Mr. Tighe. I think about 
sex a lot.” 

“Everybody does,” said Jack 
Tighe comfortingly, and he nodded. 

^ I ’’ HERE was a gallumphing 
sound from outside then and 
Wilbur LaFarge from the Shawan- 



ganunk National came trotting in. 
He was all out of breath and 
scared. 

“He’s done it again, he’s done 
it again, Mr. Tighe, sir! That Mr. 
Coglan, he came and demanded 
more money! Said he’s going to 
build a real TV network slave sta- 
tion here in Pung’s Corners. Said 
he’s opening up a branch agency 
for Yust and Ruminant, whoever 
they are. Said he was about to 
put Pung’s Corners back on the 
map and needed money to do it.” 
“And you gave it to him?” 

“I couldn’t help it.” 

Jack Tighe nodded wisely. “No, 
you couldn’t. Even in my day, 
you couldn’t much help it, not 
when the agency had you in its 
sights and the finger squeezing 
down on the trigger. Neo-scop in 
the drinking water, to make every 
living soul in Ihing’s Corners a 
little more suggestible, a little less 
stiff-backed. Even me, I suppose, 
though perhaps I don’t drink as 
much water as most. And sublimi- 
nal advertising on the wired TV, 
and subsonic compulsives when it 
comes to man-to-man talk. Tell 
me, LaFarge, did you hapjjen to 
hear a faint droning sound? I 
thought so; yes. They don’t miss 
a trick. Well,” he said, looking 
somehow pleased, “there’s no help 
for it. We’ll have to fight.” 

“Fight?” whispered Wilbur La- 
Farge, for he was no brave man, 
no, not even though he later 



80 



GALAXY 



became the Secretary of the 
Treasury. 

“Fight!” boomed Jack Tighe. 

Everybody looked at everybody 
else. 

“There are hundreds of us,” said 
Jack Tighe, “and there’s only one 
of him. Yes, we’ll fight! We’ll distill 
the drinking water. We’ll rip Cog- 
lan’s little transmitter out of our 
TV circuit. Timmy can work up 
electronic sniffers to see what else 
he’s using; we’ll find all his gad- 
gets, and we’ll destroy them. The 
subsonics? Why, he has to carry 
that gear with him. We’ll just take 
it away from him. It’s either that 
or we give up our heritage as free 
men!” 

Wilbur LaFarge cleared • his 
throat. “And then—” 

“Well you may say ‘and then,”’ 
agreed Jack Tighe. “And then the 
United States Cavalry comes 
charging over the hill to rescue 
him. Yes. But you must have 
realized by now, gentlemen, that 
this means war.” 

And so they had, though you 
couldn’t have said that any of them 
seemed very happy about it. 

V 

OW I have to tell you what it

know if I can explain it to you. 



either, but it’s all in a book and 
you can read it if you want to . 
a book that was written by some- 
body important, a major, who 
later on became a general (but 
that was much later and in another 
army) and whose name was T. 
Wallace Commaigne. 

The book? Why, that was called 
The End of the Beginning, and it 
is Volume One of his twelve-vol- 
ume set of memoirs entitled: I 
Served with Tighe: The Struggle 
to Win the World. 

War had been coming, war that 
threatened more, until it threat- 
ened everything, as the horrors in 
its supersonic pouches grew be- 
yond even the dreads of hysteria. 
But there was time to guesstimate, 
as Time Magazine used to call it. 

The dispersal plan came first. 
Break up cities, spread them apart, 
diffuse population and industry to 
provide the smallest possible target 
for even the largest possible bomb. 

But dispersal increased another 
vulnerability— more freight trains, 
more cargo ships, more boxcar 
planes carrying raw materials to 
and finished products from an in- 
finity of production points. Harder, 
yes, to hit and destroy, easier to 
choke off coming and going. 

Then dig in, the planners said. 
Not dispersal but bomb shelter. 
But more than bomb shelter — 
make the factories mine for their 
ores, drill for their fuels, pump for 
their coolants and steams — and 



THE WIZARDS OF RUNG’S CORNERS 



81 



make them independent of sup- 
plies that may never be delivered, 
of workers who could not live be- 
lowground for however long the 
unpredictable war may last, sec- 
onds or forever — even of brains 
that might not reach the drawing 
boards and research labs and di- 
rectors’ boards, brains that might 
either be dead or concussed into 
something other than brains. 

So the sub-surface factories even 
designed for themselves, always on 
a rising curve: 

Against an enemy presupposed 
to grow smarter and slicker and 
quicker with each advance, just as 
we and our machines do. Against 
our having fewer and fewer fight- 
ing men; pure logic that, as war 
continues, more and more are 
killed, fewer and fewer left to 
operate the killer engines. Against 
the destruction or capture of even 
the impregnable undergroimd fac- 
tories, guarded as no dragon of 
legend ever was — by all that Man 
could devise at first in the way 
of traps and cages, blast and ray— 
and then by the slipleashed inven- 
tion of machines ordered always to 
speed up — more and more, dead- 
lier and deadlier. 

And the next stage— the fortress 
factories hooked to each other, so 
that the unthinkably defended 
plants, should they inconceivably 
fall, would in the dying message 
pass their responsibilities to the 
next of kin — survivor factories to 



split up their work, increase out- 
put, step up the lethal pace of in- 
vention and perfection, still more 
murderous weapons to be operated 
by still fewer defenders. 

And another, final plan — gear 
the machines to feed and house 
and clothe and transport a nation, 
a hemisphere, a world recovering 
from no one could know in ad- 
vance what bombs and germs and 
poisons and — name it and it prob- 
ably would happen if the war 
lasted long enough. 

With a built-in signal of peace, 
of course: the air itself. Pure once 
more, the atmosphere, routinely 
tested moment by moment, would 
switch production from war to 
peace. 

And so it did. 

But who could have known be- 
forehand that the machines might 
not know war from peace? 

jjGjERE’S Detroit: a hundred 
thousand rat-inhabited man- 
less acres, blind windows and shat- 
tered walls. From the air, it is dead. 
But underneath it — ah, the rapid 
pulse of life! The hammering sys- 
tole and diastole of raw-material 
conduits sucking in fuel and ore, 
pumping out finished autos. Spidery 
passages stretched out to the taco- 
nite beds under the Lakes. Fleets 
of barges issued from concrete p>ens 
to match the U-boat nests at 
Lorient and, unmanned, swam the 
Lakes and the canals to their dis- 



82 



GALAXY 



tribution points, bearing shiny new 
Buicks and Plymouths. 

What made them new? 

Why, industrial design! For the 
model years changed. The Dyna- 
flow ’61 gave place to the Super- 
Dynaflow Mark Eight of 1962; 
twin - beam headlights became 
triple; white-wall tires turned to 
pastel and back to solid ebony 
black. 

It was a matter of design effi- 
ciency. 

What the Founding Fathers 
learned about production was es- 
sentially this: It don’t much mat- 
ter what you build, it only mat- 
ters that people should want to 
buy it. What they learned was: 
Never mind the judgmatical facul- 
ties of the human race. They are 
a frail breed. They move no mer- 
chandise. They boost no sales. 
Rely, instead, on the monkey trait 
of curiosity. 

And curiosity, of course, feeds 
on secrecy. 

So generations of automotiva- 
tors created new cosmetic gim- 
micks for their cars in secret lab- 
oratories staffed by sworn mutes. 
No atomic device was half so clas- 
sified! And all Detroit echoed their 
security measures; fleets of can- 
vas-swathed mysteries swarmed 
the highways at new-model time 
each year; people talked. Oh, yes 
— they laughed; it was comic; but 
though they were amused, they 
were piqued; it was good to make 



a joke of the mystery, but the 
capper to the joke was to own 
one of the new models oneself. 

The appliance manufacturers 
pricked up their ears. Ah, so. Curi- 
osity, eh? So they leased concealed 
space to design new ice-tray com- 
partments and brought them out 
with a flourish of trumpets. Their 
refrigerators sold like mad. Yes, 
like mad. 

RCA brooded over the lesson 
and added a fillip of their own; 
there was the vinylite record, un- 
breakable, colorful, new. They de- 
signed it under wraps and then, 
the crowning touch, they leaked 
the secret; it was the trick that 
Manhattan Project hadn’t learned 
— a secret that concealed the real 
secret. For all the vinylite pro- 
gram was only a facade; it was 
security in its highest manifesta- 
tion; the vinylite program was a 
mere cover for the submerged LP. 

It moved goods. But there was 
a limit. The human race is a blab- 
bermouth. 

Very well, said some great un- 
known, eliminate the human race! 
Let a machine design the new 
models! Add a design unit. Set it, 
by means of wobblators and ran- 
dom-choice circuits, to make its 
changes in an unforeseeable way. 
Automate the factories; conceal 
them underground; program the 
machine to program itself. After 
all, why not? As Coglan had quoted 
Charles F. Kettering, “Our chief 



THE WIZARDS OF RUNG’S CORNERS 



83 



job in research is to keep the cus- 
tomer reasonably dissatisfied with 
what he has,” and proper machines 
can do that as well as any man. 
Better, if you really want to know. 

And so the world was full of 
drusy caverns from which wonders 
constantly poured. The war had 
given industry its start by start- 
ing the dispersal pattern; bomb 
shelter had embedded the factories 
in rock; now industrial security 
made the factories independent. 
Goods flowed out in a variegated 
torrent. 

But they couldn’t stop. And no- 
body could get inside to shut them 
off or even slow them down. And 
that torrent of goods, made for 
so many people who didn’t exist, 
had to be 'moved. The advertising 
men had to do the moving, and 
they were excellent at the job. 

S O that was the outside, a very, 
very busy place and a very, 
very big one. In spite of what hap>- 
pened in the big war. 

I can’t begin to tell you how 
busy it was or how big; I can only 
tell you about a little bit of it. 
There was a building called the 
Pentagon and it covered acres of 
ground. It had five sides, of course; 
one for the Army, one for the 
Navy, one for the Air Force, one 
for the Marines, and one for the 
offices of Yust 8s Ruminant. 

So here’s the Pentagon, this 
great big building, the nerve cen- 




84 



GALAXY 




THE WIZARDS OF RUNG’S CORNERS 



85 




ter of the United States in every 
way that mattered. (There was 
also a “Capitol,” as they called it, 
but that doesn’t matter much. 
Didn’t then, in fact.) 

And here’s Major Commaigne, 
in his scarlet dress uniform with 
his epaulettes and his little gilt 
sword. He’s waiting in the ante- 
room of the Director’s Office of 
Yust & Ruminant, nervously 
watching television. He’s been 
waiting there for an hour, and 
then at last they send for him. 

He goes in. 

Don’t try to imagine his emo- 
tions as he walks into that pigskin- 
paneled suite. You can’t. But un- 
derstand that he believes that the 
key to all of his future lies in 
this room; he believes that with 
all his heart and in a way, as it 
develop®, he is right. 

“Major,” snaps an old man, a 
man very like Coglan and very 
like Jack Tighe, for they were all 
pretty much of a breed, those Ivy- 
League charcoal-grays, “Major, 
he’s coming through. It’s just as 
we feared. There has been trouble.” 

“Yes, sir!” 

Major Commaigne is very erect 
and military in his bearing, be- 
cause he has been an Army officer 
for fifteen years now and this is 
his first chance at combat. He 
missed the big war — well, the 
whole Army missed the big war; 
it was over too fast for moving 
troops — and fighting has pretty 



much stoppsed since then. It isn’t 
safe to fight, except under certain 
conditions. But maybe the condi- 
tions are right now, he thinks. And 
it can mean a lot to a major’s 
career, these days, if he gets an ex- 
peditionary force to lead and ac- 
quits himself well with it! 

So he stands erect, alert, sharp- 
eyed. His braided cap is tucked 
in the corner of one arm, and 
his other hand rests on the hilt 
of his sword, and he looks fierce. 
Why, that’s natural enough, too. 
What comes in over the TV com- 
municator in that pigskin-paneled 
office would make any honest 
Army officer look fierce. The au- 
thority of the United States has 
been flouted! 

“L.S.,” gasp® the image of a 
tall, dark old man in the picture 
tube, “they’ve turned against me! 
They’ve seized my transmitter, 
neutralized my drugs, confiscated 
my subsonic gear. All I have left 
is this transmitter!” 

And he isn’t urbane any more, 
this man Coglan whose picture is 
being received in this room; he 
looks excited and he looks mad. 

“Funny,” comments Mr. Maffi- 
ty, called “L.S.” by his intimate 
staff, “that they didn’t take the 
transmitter away too. They must 
have known you’d contact us and 
that there would be reprisals.” 

“But they wanted me to contact 
you!” cries the voice from the pic- 
ture tube. “I told them what it 



86 



GALAXY 



would mean. L.S., they’re going 
crazy. They’re spoiling for a fight.” 

And after a little more talk, L.S. 
Maffity turns off the set. 

“We’ll give it to them, eh. 
Major?” he says, as stern and 
straight as a ramrod himself. 

“We will, sir!” says the major, 
and he salutes, spins around and 
leaves. Already he can feel the 
eagles on his shoulders — who 
knows, maybe even stars! 

And that is how the punitive 
expedition came to be launched; 
and it was exactly what Pung’s 
Corners could have expected as 
a result of their actions — could 
have, and did. 

TVroW I already told you that 
^ ^ fighting had been out of fash- 
ion for some time, though getting 
ready to fight was a number-one 
preoccupation of a great many 
people. You must understand that 
there appeared to be no contra- 
diction in these two contradictory 
facts, outside. 

The big war had pretty much 
discouraged anybody from doing 
anything very violent. Fighting in 
the old-fashioned way — that is, 
with missiles and radio-dust and 
atomic cannon — had turned out 
to be expensive and for other 
reasons impractical. It was only 
the greatest of luck then that 
stopped things before the planet 
was wiped off, nice and clean, of 
everything more advanced than 



the notochord, ready for the one- 
celled beasts of the sea to start 
over again. Now things were dif- 
ferent. 

First place, all atomic explosives 
were under rigid interdiction. 
There were a couple of dozen coun- 
tries in the world that owned 
A-bombs or better, and every one 
of them had men on duty, twenty- 
four hours a day, with their fingers 
held ready over buttons that would 
wipe out for once and all which- 
ever one of them might first use 
an atomic weapon again. So that 
was out. 

And aircraft, by the same token, 
lost a major part of their use- 
fulness. The satellites with their 
beady little TV eyes scanned 
every place every second, so that 
you didn’t dare drop even an or- 
dinary HE bomb as long as some 
nearsighted chap watching through 
a satellite relay might mistake it 
for something nuclear — and give 
the order to push one of those 
buttons. 

This left, generally speaking, the 
infantry. 

But what infantry it was! A 
platoon of riflemen was twenty- 
three men and it owned roughly 
the firepower of all of Napoleon’s 
legions. A company comprised 
some twelve hundred and fifty, 
and it could singlehanded have 
won World War One. 

Hand weapons spat out literally 
sheets of metal, projectiles firing 



THE WIZARDS OF PUNG’S CORNERS 



87 



so rapidly one after another that 
you didn’t so much try to shoot 
a target as to slice it in half. As 
far as the eye could see, a rifle 
bullet could fly. And where the 
eye was blocked by darkness, by 
fog or by hills, the sniperscope, the 
radarscreen and the pulse-beam 
interferometer sights could locate 
the target as though it were ten 
yards away at broad noon. 

They were, that is to say, very 
modern weapxDns. In fact, the 
weapons that this infantry carried 
were so modem that half of each 
company was in process of learn- 
ing to operate weapons that the 
other half had already discarded 
as obsolete. Who wanted a Magic- 
Eye Self-Aiming All-Weather Gun- 
sight, Mark XXII, when a Mark 
XXIII, with Dubl-Jeweled Bear- 
ings, was available? 

For it was one of the triumphs 
of the age that at last the planned 
obsolescence and high turnover of, 
say, a TV set or a Detroit car had 
been extended to carbines and 
bazookas. 

It was wonderful and frighten- 
ing to see. 

TT was these heroes, then, who 
went off to war, or to what- 
ever might come. 

Major Commaigne (so he says 
in his book) took a full company 
of men, twelve hundred and fifty 
strong, and started out for Pung’s 
Comers. Air brought them to the 



plains of Lehigh County, burned 
black from radiation but no longer 
dangerous. From there, they jour- 
neyed by wheeled vehicles. 

Major Commaigne was coldly 
confident. The radioactivity of the 
sands surrounding Pung’s Corners 
was no problem. Not with the 
massive and perfect equipment 
he had for his force. What old Mr. 
Coglan could do, the United States 
Army could do better; Coglan 
drove inside sheet lead, but the 
expeditionary force cmised in 
solid iridium steel, with gamma- 
ray baffles fixed in place. 

Each platoon had its own half- 
track personnel carrier. Not only 
did the men have their hand 
weapons, but each vehicle mounted 
a 105-mm explosive cannon, with 
Zip-Fire Auto-Load and Wizard- 
trol Safety Interlock. Fluid mount- 
ings sustained the gimbals of the 
cannon. Radar picked out its tar- 
get. Automatic digital computers 
predicted and outguessed the flight 
of its prey. 

In the lead personnel carrier. 
Major Commaigne barked a last 
word to his troops: 

“This is it, men! The chips are 
down! You have trained for this a 
long time and now you’re in the 
middle of it. I don’t know how 
we’re going to make out in there—” 
and he swung an arm in the direc- 
tion of Pung’s Comers, a gesture 
faithfully reproduced in living 
three-dimensional color on the in- 



88 



GALAXY 



tercoms of each personnel carrier 
in his fleet— “but win or lose, and 
I know we’re going to win, I want 
every one of you to know that you 
belong to the best Company in the 
best Regiment of the best Com- 
bat Infantry Team of the best 
Division of—” 

Crump went the 105-mm piece 
on the lead personnel carrier as 
radar range automatically sighted 
in and fired upon a moving object 
outside, thus drowning out the 
tributes he had intended to pay 
to Corps, to Army, to Group and 
to Command. 

The battle for Pung’s Comers 
had begun. 

VI 

I^OW that first target, it wasn’t 
^ ' any body. 

It was only a milch cow, and 
one in need of freshening at that. 
She shouldn’t have been on the 
baseball field at all, but there she 
was, and since that was the direc- 
tion from which the invader de- 
scended on the town, she made the 
supreme sacrifice. Without even 
knowing she’d done it, of course. 

Major Commaigne snap>ped at 
his adjutant: “Lefferts! Have the 
ordnance sections put the one-oh- 
fives on safety. Can’t have this 
sort of thing.” It had been a dis- 
agreeable sight, to see that pxjor 
old cow become hamburger, well 
ketchuped, so rapidly. Better chain 



the big guns until one saw, at any 
rate, whether Pung’s Comers was 
going to put up a fight. 

So Major Commaigne stopped 
the personnel carriers and ordered 
everybody out. They were past the 
dangerous radioactive area any- 
way. 

The troops fell out in a hand- 
some line of skirmish; it was very, 
very fast and very, very good. 
From the top of the Presbyterian 
Church steeple in Pung’s Corners, 
Jack Tighe and Andy Grammis 
watched through field glasses, and I 
can tell you that Grammis was 
pretty near hysterics. But Jack 
Tighe only hummed and nodded. 

Major Commaigne gave an or- 
der and every man in the line of 
skirmish instantly dug in. Some 
were in marsh and some in mud; 
some had to tunnel into solid rock 
and some— nearest where that first 
target had been — through a thin 
film of beef. It didn’t much mat- 
ter, because they didn’t use the en- 
trenching spades of World War II; 
thov had Powr-Pakt Diggers that 
clawed into an 5 dhing in seconds, 
and, what’s more, lined the pits 
with a fine ceramic glaze. It was 
magnificent. 

And yet, on the other hand — 

Well, look. It was this way. 
Twenty-six personnel carriers had 
brought them here. Each carrier 
had its driver, its relief driver, its 
emergency alternate driver and its 
mechanic. It had its radar - and - 



THE WIZARDS OF PUNG’S CORNERS 



89 



electronics repairman, and its ra- 
dar-and-electronics repairman’s as- 
sistant. It had its ordnance staff of 
four, and its liaison communica- 
tions officer to man the intercom 
and keep in touch with the P.C. 
commander. 

Well, they needed all those peo- 
ple, of course. Couldn’t get along 
without them. 

OUT that came to two hundred 
and eighty-two men. 

Then there was the field kitchen, 
with its staff of forty-seven, plus 
administrative detachment and 
dietetic staff; the headquarters de- 
tachment, with paymaster’s corps 
and military police platoon; the 
meteorological section, a proud 
sight as they began setting up their 
field teletypes and fax receivers 
and launching their weather bal- 
loons; the field hospital with 
eighty-one medics and nurses, nine 
medical officers and attached med- 
ical administrative staff; the spe- 
cial services detachment, prompt 
to begin setting up a three-D mo- 
tion-picture screen in the lee of 
the parked personnel carriers and 
to commence organizing a hand- 
ball tournament among the off- 
duty men; the four chaplains and 
chaplains’ assistants, plus the Wis- 
dom Counselor for Ethical Cul- 
turists, agnostics and waverers; the 
Historical Officer and his eight 
trained clerks, already going from 
foxhole to foxhole bravely carry- 



ing tape recorders, to take down 
history as it was being made in the 
form of first-hand impressions of 
the battle that had yet to be 
fought; military observers from 
Canada, Mexico, Uruguay, the 
Scandinavian Confederation and 
the Soviet Socialist Republic of 
Inner Mongolia, with their order- 
lies and attaches; and, of course, 
field correspondents from Stars 86 
Stripes, the New York Times, the 
Christian Science Monitor, the 
Scripps-Howard chain, five wire 
services, eight television networks, 
an indep)endent documentary mo- 
tion-picture producer, and one 
hundred and twenty-seven other 
newspapers and allied public infor- 
mation outlets. 

It was a stripped-down combat 
command, naturally. Therefore, 
there was only one Public Infor- 
mation Officer p>er reporter. 

Still . 

Well, it left exactly forty-six 
riflemen in line of skirmish. 

U P IN the Presbyterian belfry, 
Andy Grammis wailed : “Look 
at them. Jack! I don’t know, 
maybe letting advertising back into 
Pong’s Corners wouldn’t be so bad. 
All right, it’s a rat race, but — ■” 
“Wait,” said Jack Tighe quietly, 
and hummed. 

They couldn’t see it very well, 
but the line of skirmish was in 
some confusion. The word had 
been passed down that all the field 



90 



GALAXY 



pieces had been put on safety and 
that the entire firepower of the 
company rested in their forty-six 
rifles. Well, that wasn’t so bad; but 
after all, they had been equipp>ed 
with E-Z-Fyre Revolv-a-Clip Car- 
bines until ten days before the 
expeditionary force had been 
mounted. Some of the troops 
hadn’t been fully able to familiar- 
ize themselves with the new 
weapons. 

It went like this; 

“Sam,” called one private to the 
man in the next foxhole. “Sam, 
listen, I can’t figure this something 
rifle out. When the something 
green light goes on, does that 
mean that the something safety 
is off?” 

“Beats the something hell out 
of me,” rejoined Sam, his brow 
furrowed as he pored over the 
full-color, glossy-paper operating 
manual, alluringly entitled. The 
Five-Step Magic-Eye Way to New 
Combat Comfort and Security. 
“Did you see what it says here? 
It says, ‘Magic-Eye in Off posi- 
tion is provided with positive 
Fayl-Sayf action, thus assuring 
Evr-Kleen Cartridge of dynamic 
ejection and release, when used in 
combination with Shoulder-Eez 
Anti-Recoil Pads.’” 

“What did you say, Sam?” 

“I said it beats the something 
hell out of me,” said Sam, and 
pitched the manual out into no- 
man’s-land before him. 



But he was sorry and immedi- 
ately crept out to retrieve it, for 
although the directions seemed in- 
tended for a world that had no 
relation to the rock-and-mud terra 
firma around Pung’s Corners, all 
of the step-by-step instructions in 
the manual were illustrated by 
mockup photographs of starlets in 
Bikinis — for the cavern factories 
produced instruction manuals as 
well as weapons. They had to, ob- 
viously, and they were good at it; 
the more complicated the direc- 
tions, the more photographs they 
used. The vehicular ones were 
downright shocking. 

S OME minutes later: “They 
don’t seem to be doing any- 
thing,” ventured Andy Grammis, 
watching from the steeple. 

“No, they don’t, Andy. Well, we 
can’t sit up here forever. Come 
along and we’ll see what’s what.” 
Now Andy Grammis didn’t 
want to do that, but Jack Tighe 
was a man you didn’t resist very 
well, and so they climbed down 
the winding steel stairs and picked 
up the rest of the Pung’s Corners 
Independence Volunteers, all four- 
teen of them, and they started 
down Front Street and out across 
the baseball diamond. 

Twenty-six personnel carriers 
electronically went ping, and the 
turrets of their one-oh-fives 
swiveled to zero in on the Inde- 
pendence Volunteers.

Forty-six riflemen, swearing, at- 
tempted to make Akur-A-C Green- 
line Sighting Strip cross Horizon 
Blue True-Site Band in the Up- 
Close radar screens of their rifles. 

And Major Commaigne, howl- 
ing mad, waved a sheet of paper 
under the nose of his adjutant. 
“What kind of something non- 
sense is this?” he demanded, for a 
soldier is a soldier regardless of 
his rank. “I can’t take those men 
out of line with the enemy ad- 
vancing on us!” 

“Army orders, sir,” said the 
adjutant impenetrably. He had got 
his doctorate in Military Juris- 
prudence at Harvard Law and he 
knew whose orders meant what to 
whom. “The rotation plan isn’t 
my idea, sir. Why not take it up 
with the Pentagon?” 

“But, Lefferts, you idiot, I can’t 
get through to the Pentagon! 
Those something newspapermen 
have the channels sewed up solid! 
And now you want me to take 
every front-line rifleman out and 
send him to a rest camp for three 
weeks — ” 

“No, sir,” corrected the adjutant, 
pointing to a line in the order. 
“Only for twenty days, sir, includ- 
ing travel time. But you’d best do 
it right away, sir, I expect. The 
order’s marked ‘priority.’” 

Well, Major Commaigne was no 
fool. Never mind what they said 
later. He had studied the catastro- 
phe of Von Paulus at Stalingrad 



and Lee’s heaven-sent escape from 
Gettysburg, and he knew what 
could happen to an exp>editionary 
force in trouble in enemy territory. 
Even a big one. And his, you must 
remember, was very small. 

IJE knew that when you’re on 
•■■■■■ your own, eveiything becomes 
your enemy; frost and diarrhea de- 
stroyed more of the Nazi Sixth 
Army than the Russians did; the 
jolting wagons of Lee’s retreat put 
more of his woimded and sick out 
of the way than Meade’s cannon. 
So he did what he had to do. 

“Sound the retreat!” he bawled. 
“We’re going back to the bam.” 

Retire and regroup; why not? 
But it wasn’t as simple as that. 

The personnel carriers backed 
and turned like a fleet in maneu- 
vers. Their drivers were trained 
for that But one PC got caught 
in Special Service’s movie screen 
and blundered into another, and 
a flotilla of three of them found 
themselves stymied by the spread- 
ing pre-fabs of the field hospital. 
Five of them, doing extra duty in 
running electric generators from 
the {X)wer takeoffs at their rear 
axles, were immobilized for fifteen 
minutes and then boxed in. 

What it came down to was that 
four of the twenty-six were in 
shape to move right then. And ob- 
viously that wasn’t enough, so it 
wasn’t a retreat at all; it was a 
disaster.

“There’s only one thing to do,” 
brooded Major Commaigne amid 
the turmoil, with manly tears 
streaming down his face, “but how 
I wish I’d never tried to make 
lieutenant colonel!” 

S O Jack Tighe received Com- 
maigne’s surrender. Jack Tighe 
didn’t act surprised. I can’t say the 
same for the rest of the Independ- 
ence Volunteers. 

“No, Major, you may keep your 
sword,” said Jack Tighe kindly. 
“And all of the officers may keep 
their Pinpoint Levl-Site No-Jolt 
sidearms.” 

“Thank you, sir,” wept the 
major, and blundered back into 
the officer’s club which the Head- 
quarters Detachment had never 
stopped building. 

Jack Tighe looked after him 
with a peculiar and thoughtful ex- 
pression. 

William LaFarge, swinging a 
thirty-inch hickory stick — it was 



all he’d been able to pick up as a 
weapon — babbled: “It’s a great 
victory! Now they’ll leave us 
alone, I bet!” 

Jack Tighe didn’t say a single 
word. 

“Don’t you think so. Jack? 
Won’t they stay away now?” 

Jack Tighe looked at him 
blankly, seemed about to answer 
and then turned to Charley Frink. 
“Charley. Listen. Don’t you have 
a shotgun put away somewhere?” 
“Yes, Mr. Tighe. And a .22. 
Want me to get them?” 

“Why, yes, I think I do.” Jack 
Tighe watched the youth run off. 
His eyes were hooded. And then 
he said; “Andy, do something for 
us. Ask the major to give us a 
P.O.W. driver who knows the way 
to the Pentagon.” 

And a few minutes later, 
Charley came back with the shot- 
gun and the .22; and ffie rest, of 
course, is history.

Be warned by Alfred's chilling experience 
— don't check into a hotel under the name 
of Smith — especially if that's your namel

T he telephone rang. Alfred 
Smith, who had been haul- 
ing clothes out of his valise 
and stuffing them into the typical 
hotel room bureau, looked up, 
startled. 

“Now who — ” he began, and 
shook his head. 

Obviously it must be a wrong 
number. Nobody knew he was in 
New York, and nobody — this for 
a certainty — knew he had checked 
into this particular hotel. Or, come 
to think of it, somebody did. 



The room clerk at the desk 
where he had just registered. 

Must be some hotel business. 
Something like don’t use the lamp 
on the end table— it tends to short- 
circuit 

The telephone rang again. He 
dropped the valise and circled the 
bed. He picked up the phone. 

“Yes?” he said. 

“Mr. Smith?” came a thick voice 
from the other end. 

“Speaking.” 

“This is Mr. Jones. Mr. Cohen 

95 



LISBON CUBED 



and Mr. Kelly are with me in 
the lobby. So is Jane Doe. Do you 
want us to come up or shall we 
wait for you?” 

“Huh?” 

“Well, then, well come up. 
Room 504, isn’t it?” 

“Yes, but wait a minute! Who 
did you say?” He realized the man 
had hung up. 

A LFRED Smith put down the 
telephone and ran his fin- 
gers through his crew-cut. He was 
a moderately tall, moderately ath- 
letic, moderately handsome young 
man with only the faintest hint at 
jowl and belly of recent prosperity. 

“Mr. Jones? Cohen? Kelly? 
And, for suffering sake, Jane Doe?” 
It must be a joke. Any Smith 
was used to jokes on his name. 
What was your name before it was 
Smith? Alfred Smith? Whatever 
happened to good old Johimie? 

Then he remembered that his 
caller had just asked for Mr. Smith. 
Smith was a common name, like 
it or not 

He picked up the phone again. 
“Desk,” he told the operator. 
“Desk,” a smooth voice said. 
“This is Mr. Smith in Room 
504. Was there another Smith 
registered here before me?” 

A long pause. “Are you having 
any trouble, sir?” 

Alfred Smith grimaced. “That’s 
not what I’m asking. Was there or 
wasn’t there?” 



“Well, sir, if you could tell me 
if it is causing you inconvenience 
in any way . .” 

He got exasperated. “I asked 
you a simple question. Was there 
a Smith in this room before me? 
What’s the matter, did he kill him- 
self?” 

“We have no right to believe he 
committed suicide, sir!” the desk 
clerk said emphatically. “There are 
many, many circumstances imder 
which a guest might disappear af- 
ter registering for a room!” 

There was a peremptory knock 
on the door. Alfred Smith grunted, 
“Okay, that’s all I wanted to 
know,” and hung up. 

He opened the door, and be- 
fore he could say anything, four 
people came in. Three were men, 
the last was a mildly attractive 
woman. 

“Now look — ” he started to pro- 
test. 

“Hello, Gar-Pitha,” one of the 
men said. “I’m Jones. This is 
Cohen and this is Kelly. And, of 
course, this is Jane Doe.” 

“There’s been a mistake,” Al- 
fred told him. 

“And how there’s been a mis- 
take!” said Cohen, locking the door 
behind him carefully. “Jones, you 
called Smith by his right name — 
when the corridor door was open! 
That’s unpardonable stupidity.” 

Jane Doe nodded. “Door open 
or door closed, we must remember 
that we are on Earth. We will use 



96 



GALAXY 



only Elarth names. Operating Pro- 
cedure Regulations XIV-XXII.” 

Alfred took a long, slow look 
at her. “On Earth?” 

She smiled shamefacedly. “There 
I go myself, doing practically the 
same thing. You’re right In Amer- 
ica. Or rather, to put it more exact- 
ly and less suspiciously, in New 
York City.” 

Mr. Kelly had been walking 
aroimd Alfred, staring at him. 
“You’re perfect,” he said at last. 
“Better than any of us. That dis- 
guise took a lot of hard, patient 
work. Don’t tell me, I know. You’re 
perfect. Smith, perfect” 

Vj^HAT in the world were they, 
” Alfred wondered frantically— 
limatics? No, spies! Should he say 
something, should he give the mis- 
take away, or should he start yell- 
ing his head off for help? But 
maybe they weren’t spies — maybe 
they were detectives on the trail of 
spies. He was in New York, after 
all. New York wasn’t the hinter- 
lands of Illinois. 

And that suggested another pos- 
sibility. New York, the home of 
the sharpie, the smart aleck. It 
could be a simple practical joke 
being played by some city slickers 
on a new hayseed. 

If it was . 

His visitors had found seats for 
themselves. Mr. Kelly opened the 
briefcase he was carrying and 
grubbed around in it with his fin- 



gers. A low hum filled the room. 

“Not enough power,” Mr. Kelly 
apologized. “This is a small sun, 
you know. But give the rig a few 
minutes; it’ll build up.” 

Mr. Jones leaned forward. 
“Listen, do you folks mind if I 
slip out of my disguise? I’m hot” 
“You’re not supposed to,” Jane 
Doe reminded him. “The uniform 
is to be worn at all times when 
we’re on duty.” 

“I know, I know, but Sten- 
Durok — oops, I mean Cohen — 
locked the door. Nobody comes in 
through windows in this particular 
place, and we don’t have to worry 
about materialization. So how 
about I relax for a second or two?” 
Alfred had perched on the edge 
of the dresser. He looked Mr. 
Jones over with great amusement 
The pudgy little man was wear- 
ing a cheap gray sharkskin suit 
He was bald, he wore no eye- 
glasses, he had no beard. He didn’t 
even have a mustache. 

Disguise, eh? 

“I say let him,” Alfred suggested 
with an anticipatory chuckle. 
“We’re all alone — he might as 
well be comfortable. Go ahead, 
Jones, take off your disguise.” 
“Thanks,” Jones said with feel- 
ing. “I’m suffocating in this outfit” 
Alfred chuckled again. He’d 
show these New Yorkers. 

“Take it off. Be comfortable. 
Make yourself at home.” 

Jones nodded and unbuttoned 

97 



LISBON CUBED 



the jacket of his gray sharkskin 
suit. Then he unbuttoned the white 
shirt under it Then he put his 
two forefingers into his chest all 
the way in, and pulled his chest 
apart. He kept pulling until there 
was a great dark hole about ten 
inches wide. 

A BLACK spider squirmed out 
of the opening. Its round little 
body was about the size of a man’s 
fist its legs about the size and 
length of pipe stems. It crouched 
on Jones* chest while the body 
from which it had emerged main- 
tained its position in a kind of 
paralysis, the fingers still holding 
the chest apart, the back and legs 
still resting comfortably in the 
chair. 

“Whew!” said the spider. “That 
feels good.” 

Alfred foimd he couldn’t stop 
chuckling. He finally managed to 
halt the noise from his mouth, but 
it kept on going in his head. He 
stared at the spider, at the stiff 
body from which it had come. 
Then, near panic, he stared at the 
others in the room, at Cohen, at 
Kelly, at Jane Doe. 

They couldn’t have looked less 
interested. 

The hum from the briefcase on 
Kelly’s knees abruptly resolved 
itself into words. Alfred’s visitors 
stopped acting bored and leaned 
forward attentively, looking at the 
small lens that rose on a slender 



periscopic rod and revolved slow- 
ly, pausing briefly at each person. 

“Greetings, Special Emissaries,” 
said the voice. “This is Command 
Central speaking. Robinson, to 
you. Are there any reports of sig- 
nificance?” 

“None from me,” Jane Doe said. 

“Nor me,” from Kelly. 

“Nothing new yet,” said Cohen. 

The spider stretched itself luxu- 
riously. “Same here. Nothing to 
report” 

“Jones!” ordered the voice from 
the briefcase. “Get back into your 
uniform!” 

“It’s hot, Chief. And we’re all 
alone in here, sitting behind what 
they call a locked door. We don’t 
have anything to worry about” 

“I’ll tell you what and what not 
to worry about You get into 
that uniform, Jones! Or maybe 
you’re tired of being a Special 
Emissary? Maybe you’d like to be 
demoted to General Emissary 
status?” 

The spider stretched its legs and 
performed what could only be de- 
scribed as a shrug. Then it backed 
carefully into the hole in the 
chest. The hole closed behind it 
The body of Jones came to life 
and buttoned his shirt and jacket 

“That’s better,” said the voice 
from the briefcase on Kelly’s knee. 
“Don’t ever do that again while 
you’re on duty.” 

“Okay, Chief, okay. But couldn’t 
we cool down this planet? You 



98 



GALAXY 



know^ start a new ice age? It 
would make it a lot easier to 
work.” 

“And a lot easier to be detected, 
stupid. You worry about the big 
things like conventions and beauty 
contests. We*ll worry about the lit- 
tle things here, in Command Cen- 
tral, like arbitrarily starting new 
ice ages. All right. Smith, how 
about you? Whafs your report?” 

OTARTLED, Alfred Smith 
^ shook the thick gathered wool 
out of his head, slid off the dresser 
and onto his feet. He looked 
around wildly. 

“Re-ieport?" A breath. “Why, 
nothing — nothing to report.” 
“Took you a long time to make 
up your mind about it You’re not 
holding anything back, are you? 
Remember, it’s our job to evalu- 
ate information, not yours.” 

Alfred wet his lips. “N-no. I’m 
not holding anything back.” 

“You’d better not. One beauty 
contest you forget to tell us about 
and you’re through. Smith. We 
still haven’t forgotten that boner 
you pulled in Zagreb.” 

“Now, Chief,” Jane Doe inter- 
vened, “that was only a local stunt 
to discover who was the tallest 
card-carrying Commtmist in Croa- 
tia. You can’t blame Smith for 
missing that” 

“We certainly can blame Smith 
for that. It was a beauty contest, 
within the definition of the term 



you were given. If Cohen hadn’t 
stumbled across a mention of it 
in the Kiev Pravda, all hell could 
have broken loose. Remember 
that. Smith. And stop calling me 
Chief, all of you. The name is 
Robinson. Remember that, too.” 

They all nodded, Alfred with 
them. He shot a mixed look of un- 
certainty and gratitude at Jane 
Doe. 

“All right,” the voice went on, 
somewhat mollified. “And to show 
you that I can hand out the boosts 
as well as the knocks, I want to 
commend Smith on his disguise. 
It’s a little off-beat, but it rings 
true — and that’s the main thing. 
If the rest of you only spent as 
much time and care on your uni- 
forms, we’d be in the home 
stretch — ” the voice paused and 
took on an oily, heavily whimsical 
quality — “before you could say 
‘Jack Robinson.’” 

They all laughed dutifully at 
that one, even Alfred. 

“You think Smith did a good 
job on his disguise, don’t you. Chief 
— I mean, Mr. Robinson?” Jane 
Doe asked eagerly, as if she 
wanted to underline the fact for 
everyone. 

“I certainly do. Look at that 
suit. It’s not just any old suit, 
but a tweed jacket and flannel 
pants. Now that’s what I call 
using your imagination. His chin 
isn’t just a chin, it’s a cleft chin. 
Very good. The color of his hair

— first-rate. The only thing I might 
possibly object to is the bow tie. 
I’d say a good solid rep tie, regu- 
lar length, would be a little less 
chancy, a little less likely to at- 
tract attention. But it feels right, 
and that’s the main thing — the 
feel of the disguise. In this busi- 
ness, you either have an instinct 
for merging with the population of 
the planet, or you don’t I think 
Smith has it Good work. Smith.” 
“Thank you,” Alfred mumbled. 
“All right Ch — er — Robinson,” 
Mr. Jones said impatiently. “It’s a 
good uniform-disguise. But it’s not 
that important Our work is more 
important than how we look.” 
“Your work is how you look. 
If you look right, you work right 
Take yourself, for example, Jones. 
A more nondescript carelessly as- 
sembled human being, I don’t think 
I’ve ever come across before. What 
are you suppposed to be — Mr. 
American-Man-in-the-Street?” 

1^’ R. Jones looked deeply hurt. 
iT± «i>m supposed to be a Brook- 
lyn druggist. And believe me, the 
uniform is plenty good enough. I 
know. You should see some of 
these druggists.” 

“Some, Jones, but not most. And 
that’s my point” 

There was a throat-clearing 
sound from Mr. Cohen. “Don’t 
want to interrupt you, Robinson, 
but this isn’t supposed to be a long 
visit we’re having with Smith. We 



just dropped up, kind of.” 

“Right, Cohen, right on the old 
button. Everybody ready for in- 
structions?” 

“Ready,” they all chorused, Al- 
fred coming in raggedly on the 
last syllable. 

“Here we go then. Cohen, you’re 
back on your old assignment, keep- 
ing careful check on any new 
beauty contests scheduled any- 
where in the country, with special 
attention to be paid to New York, 
of course. Kelly, you’re to do the 
same with conventions. Jane Doe 
and John Smith will continue to 
look into anything that might be 
a camouflaged attempt” 

“Anything particular in mind?” 
Jane Doe asked. 

“Not for you at the moment 
You just keep making the rounds 
of beauty parlors and see if you 
stumble across something. Smith, 
we have a special item we’d like 
you to look into. There’s a fancy 
dress ball of the plumbers of the 
New York City area. Drop down 
there and see what you can see. 
And let us know if you hit it 
Fast.” 

Alfred kept his voice deter- 
minedly casual. “What do you 
want me to look out for?” 

“Well, if you don’t know by 
this time—” The voice from the 
briefcase rose impatiently. “Door 
prizes, an award for the best cos- 
tume, even a contest for Miss Pipe 
Wrench of 192 1 or whatever year

GALAXY 



Earth is in right now. I don’t think 
we have to worry about that last, 
though. It would be too damn ob- 
vious, and we haven’t hit anything 
obvious yet” 

“How about me?” Jones wanted 
to know. 

“We’ll have special instructions 
for you pretty soon. There may be 
a new angle.” 

They all looked interested at 
that but the voice from the brief- 
case did not seem disposed to elu- 
cidate further. 

“That will be all,” it said im- 
equivocally. “You can start leaving 
now.” 

Mr. Kelly zipped the briefcase 
shut, nodded at everyone, and left. 

A few moments later, Mr. Cohen 
followed him. Then Jones yawned 
and said, “Well, good-by now.” He 
closed the door behind him. 

J ANE Doe rose, but she didn’t 
go toward the door. She came 
over to where Alfred Smith was 
standing with a punched expres- 
sion in his eyes. 

“Well, John?” she said softly. 
Alfred Smith couldn’t think of 
an3^ing to say to that except, 
“Well, Jane?” 

“We’re together again. Working 
on an assignment again, together. 
Isn’t it wonderful?” 

He nodded slowly, carefully. 
“Yes. Wonderful.” 

“And if we can only close it up 
this time, finish the whole nasty 



business once and for all, we’ll be 
going back together.” 

“And then?” 

Her eyes glistened. “You know, 
darling. A quiet little web some- 
where, just for two. You and I 
alone. And piles and piles of eggs.” 
Alfred gulped, and, in spite of 
himself, turned away. 

“Oh, I’m sorry, darling,” she 
cried, taking his hand. “I’ve upset 
you. I was talking out of uniform. 
Well, then, put it this way. A cot- 
tage small by a waterfall. And 
baby makes three. You and I, 
down the golden years together. 
When your hair has turned to 
silver. There! Is that better?” 
“Lots,” he managed to get out, 
goggling appalledly at her. “Lots 
better.” 

She threw her arms around him. 
He realized he was expected to 
respond, and squeezed back. 

“Oh, I don’t care,” she whis- 
pered into his ear. “I don’t care 
about discipline or an5rthing when 
I’m close to you. And I’ll say it, 
even if Command Central is listen- 
ing. Darling, do you know what 
I’d like right now?” 

Alfred sighed. He was more than 
half afraid of what was coming. 
“No, what? What would you like 
right now?” 

“I’d like for us to be out of 
uniform, scuttling about and over 
each other in some damp, dark 
place. I’d like to feel your claws 
upon me, your antennae caressing 



LISBON CUBED

me — me — instead of this clumsy, 
emotionless disguise I’m wearing.” 
He gulped. “It — it’ll come. Be 
patient, darling.” 

S HE straightened up and became 
businesslike again. “Yes, and 
I’d better be going. Here’s a list of 
all our telephone numbers, in case 
you want to get in touch with any 
of us. Don’t forget, this operation is 
to be conducted strictly according 
to regulations. And that means no 
phmpfiing, no phmpfiing at all, 
except in the greatest emergency. 
For everything else, we use tele- 
phones.” 

“Telephones?” he foimd himself 
echoing. 

“Yes.” She gestured to the black 
instrument on its stand near the 
bed. “Those things.” 

“Oh, those things,” he repeated, 
fighting the impulse to shake his 
head hard in a cloud-clearing ges- 
ture. “Yes. Those things. But no — 
no — what did you say?” 

“No phmptfing" 

“None at all?” Surely, if he con- 
tinued to ask questions, something 
would become clear. And sane! 

Jane Doe looked extremely con- 
cerned. “Of course not! This is a 
maximum operation.” 

“Yes, that’s right,” he agreed. “A 
maximum operation. I’d forgotten 
it was maximum.” 

“Well, don’t,” she advised him 
earnestly. “Don’t do any forgetting. 
As Mr. Robinson warned you, one 



more boner like the one you pulled 
in Zagreb, darling, and you’re 
through. You’ll be kicked out of 
the Service. And then what do 
you think will happen to our plans 
together?” 

“We’ll be finished, huh?” Alfred 
studied her. Under all that girl- 
flesh, he reminded himself, there 
was a large, black spider working 
at controls like an operator in a 
steam shovel. 

“Right. I’d never marry outside 
the Service. We’d be finished. So 
do take care of yourself, darling, 
and give it all you’ve got. Stay on 
the ball. Fly right Get with it Rise 
and shine. Stick to the straight 
and narrow. Go in there and pitch. 
Don’t let George do it. Work hard 
and save your money. Early to 
bed and early to rise. Don’t be 
half safe.” 

“I’ll do my best,” he promised, 
his voice rattling 

“My little crawler,” she whis- 
pered intimately, and kissed him 
on the ear. 

She closed the door behind her. 

A LFRED groped his way to the 
bed. After a while, he noticed 
that he was imcomfortable. He was 
sitting on a valise. Absent-minded- 
ly, he shoved it to the floor. 

What had he wandered into? 
Or, to put it more accurately, what 
had wandered into him? 

Spies. Yes, they were obviously 
spies. But such spies . spies from 



102 



GALAXY 



another planet. What were they 
spying on — beauty contests, con- 
ventions, plumbers’ fancy dress 
balls? What were they looking for? 
What in the world — or, rather, 
the Galaxy — could they be look- 
ing for? 

One thing was perfectly clear. 
They were up to no good. That 
omnipresent contempt whenever 
they mentioned Earth or the things 
of Earth. 

An advance wave of invaders? 
Scouts preparing the way for the 
main body? They could be that. 

But why beauty contests? Why 
fancy dress balls? 

What was there of value that 
they could possibly learn from 
sweaty clambakes like these? 

You’d expect to find them at 
nuclear research labs, at rocket 
proving grounds, skulking about 
the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. 

Alfred decided there was no 
point in trying to follow their 
thought processes. They were com- 
pletely alien creatures; who knew 
what kind of information they 
might consider valuable, what 
might be important to them? 

But they were undoubtedly 
spies sizing up Earth for an in- 
vasion to come. 

“Filthy little spiders,” he 
growled. 

And one of them was in love 
with him. One intended to marry 
him. What was it she had said — 
piles and piles of eggs? A pretty 



thought! He shuddered from his 
neck to his knees. 

But they believed he was this 
other Smith, John Smith. Earth 
still had a chance. Pure luck had 
given Earth a counter-spy. Him. 

He felt frightened, but a little 
proud. A counter-spy. 

Alfred Smith reached for the 
telephone. “Desk!” 

There was precious little infor- 
mation from the clerk to supple- 
ment what he had been given be- 
fore. John Smith had registered 
here two weeks ago. He had left 
one afternoon and not come back. 
After the usual interval, it was as- 
sumed he had skipped, since he 
owed a few days on the bill at the 
time. His belongings were in the 
hotel storeroom. 

“No, sir, I’m sorry, sir, but hotel 
regulations do not permit us to let 
you go through his belongings. Un- 
less you wish to claim a relation- 
ship.” 

“And if I did?” Alfred asked 
eagerly. “If I did wish to claim a 
relationship?” 

“Then it would be necessary for 
you to establish proof, sir.” 

“I see. Well, thank you very 
much.” He hung up. 

"WTHERE was he now? This John 
” Smith had registered here, 
evidently under a previous agree- 
ment, as his room was to provide 
the meeting place for the entire 
group. Then he had walked out 



LISBON CUBED 



103 



one day and had not returned. 

Since the disguises were subject 
to frequent change, when another 
Smith had registerd in the same 
room, the spies assumed it was 
their man. They may not even 
have known of the lapse of time 
between the two Smiths. 

What had happened to John 
Smith? Had he defected to the 
United States government? To the 
United Nations? Hardly. There 
would be an F.B.I. man, a small 
Army unit staked out in the room 
in that case when John Smith’s 
friends showed up. 

No, he had just disappeared. 
But was he dead, killed in some 
accident, or was he only tempor- 
arily away, working bn some newly 
discovered angle for his interplane- 
tary organization? 

And what would happen to Al- 
fred when he returned? 

The young man on the bed 
shivered. Espionage groups, he re- 
called from the novels he had read, 
tended to a sort of hatchetman 
justice. They would not let an 
Earthman with knowledge of their 
operations go on living. 

He had to get help. 

But from where? The police? 
The F.B.I.? 

He shivered again at the picture 
evoked: himself, somewhat embar- 
rassed, stammering a bit, not quite 
remembering all the details, telling 
this story to a hard-faced inter- 
rogator. 



I NTERPLANETARY invasion, 
Mr. Smith? From Mars? Oh, 
not from Mars — from where 
then? Oh, you don’t quite know, 
Mr. Smith? All you’re sure of is 
that it’s an interplanetary inva- 
sion? I see. And how did you 
happen to hear of this on your first 
day in New York? Oh, four people 
came up to your hotel room and 
told you about it? Very interesting. 
Very, very interesting. And their 
names were Mr. Cohen, Mr. Kelly, 
Mr. Jones and Jane Doe? And 
your name is Smith, isn’t it? And 
all we have to do to prove your 
story is locate the address of one 
of these telephone numbers, cut 
op>en the person in whose name the 
phone is registered and find a big 
black spider inside . 

“No!” Alfred groaned aloud. 
He’d be a full-fledged matriculant 
at a laughing academy in no time 
flat. 

He needed proof — tangible 
proof. And facts. Mostly he needed 
facts. Who were these spiders, 
what was their home planet, when 
were they planning to invade, what 
kind of weapons did they have at 
their disposal — information like 
that. And lots and lots of data 
about their organization here on 
Earth, especially in America. 

How did you get such data? 
You couldn’t ask — that would be 
the surest way to expose yourself 
as a bona fide human with nothing 
more interesting inside you than 



104

the girders, tubing, pumps and vats 
common to your race and no other. 

But they’d given him an assign- 
ment. Something about a plum- 
bers’ fancy dress ball. Now, ob- 
viously, an assignment like that 
concerned their plans, their organ- 
ization. Obviously. 

He grabbed for the phone. 
“Desk? This is Mr. Smith in 
504. Yes, Mr. Smith again. Listen, 
how do I find out where the plumb- 
ers are in New York?” 

“If the plumbing in your room 
is out of order, sir,” the smooth, 
patient voice explained, “the hotel 
will send up a — ” 

“No, no, no! I don’t want a 
plumber, I want plumbers, all of 
them! The New York plumbers, 
how do I find them?” 

He distinctly heard lips being 
licked at the other end as this ques- 
tion was digested and then, aside, 
a whispered comment, “Yeah, it’s 
504 again. We got a real pip in 
that room this time. I don’t envy 
the night man tonight!” Loudly 
and clearly, if just a shade less 
smoothly, the voice replied: “You 
will find a classified telephone di- 
rectory on the desk near your bed, 
sir. You can look up plumbers 
under P. Most of the plumbers 
in Manhattan are listed there. For 
plumbers in Brooklyn, the Brotix, 
Queens and Staten Island, I would 
suggest — ” 

“I don’t want plumbers in 
Brooklyn or the Bronx! I don’t 



even want plumbers in — ” Alfred 
Smith drew a deep breath. He had 
to get a grip on himself! The fate 
of the entire planet, of the entire 
human race depended on his keep- 
ing his head. 

TTE forced his mind backward, 
inch by inch, off the plateau 
of hysteria it had moimted. He 
waited until his voice was calm. 

“This is the problem,” he said, 
slowly and carefully. “There is a 
fancy dress ball of the plumbers of 
the New York area. It’s being 
held somewhere in the city tonight 
and I’m supposed to be there. Un- 
fortunately, I’ve lost my invitation 
and it contained the address. Now 
how do you think I could go about 
finding where the ball is going to 
be?” He congratulated himself on 
the swiftness of his thinking. This 
was really being a counter-spy! 

Pause. “I could make some in- 
quiries, sir, through the usual chan- 
nels, and call you back.” And 
aside: “Now he says he’s a plumb- 
er and he wants to go to a fancy 
dress ball. Can you beat that? I 
tell you ... in this business . .” 
And to him: “Would that be satis- 
factory, sir?” 

“Fine,” Alfred Smith replied en- 
thusiastically. “That would be 
fine.” 

He himg up. Well, he was get- 
ting the hang of this espionage 
business. Nothing like a sales back- 
ground for practice in quick think- 



LISBON CUBED 



105 



ing and even quicker talking. 

He didn’t have to report to the 
office until tomorrow. That gave 
him this afternoon and this eve- 
ning to save the human race. 

Who would have thought when 
he was offered a job in New York 
with the BlakSeme Company 
(“Men Notice BlakSemes— They’re 
so Shockingly Stocking!”) what 
tremendous stakes he’d be playing 
for on the very day of his arrival? 

Of course, BlakSeme knew what 
kind of man he was; they knew 
he was executive timber or they’d 
never have hired him right out 
from under PuzzleKnit, their big- 
gest competitor. He’d made quite 
a name for himself, Alfred Smith 
was modestly willing to admit, in 
the Illinois territory. Highest sales 
increases for three years running, 
steadiest rej>eat orders for five. But 
to PuzzleKnit Nylons (“Puzzle- 
Knit Attracts Their Attention and 
Keeps Them Guessing”), he had 
just been a top-notch salesman; it 
had taken BlakSeme, with their 
"upper-bracket, Madison Avenue 
orientation, to see him as a possible 
district sales manager. 

BlakSeme alone had seen he 
was big league material. But even 
they had not guessed how big a 
league it was in which he was 
destined to play. 

The desk clerk called back. “I 
find, sir, that there is a fancy dress 
ball of the boss plumbers and 
steamfitters of the Metropolitan 



New York area. It’s at Menshevik 
Hall on Tenth Avenue at eight 
o’clock tonight. The theme of the 
ball is the ancien regime in France, 
and only people in pre-French 
Revolution costumes will be ad- 
mitted. Would you like the name 
of a place near the hotel where 
you can rent the right costume for 
the occasion?” 

“Yes,” Alfred Smith babbled. 
“Yes, yes, yes!” 

Things were beginning to click! 
He was on the trail of the aliens’ 
organization! 

A LFRED went out immediately 
and hurriedly selected a Due 
de Richelieu outfit. Since some 
small alterations were necessary, 
he had time to eat dinner before 
the costume would be delivered at 
his hotel. He ate carefully and 
nutritiously: this was going to be 
a big night. His reading matter 
throughout the meal was a booklet 
he’d picked up in the outfitting 
place, a booklet giving the descrip>- 
tions and background of all the 
costumes available for this period 
— sixteenth to eighteenth century 
France. Any fact might be the vital 
clue . 

Back in his room, he tore off his 
clothes and pulled on the rented 
apparel. He was a little disap- 
pointed at the result He did not 
quite look like a Gray Eminence. 
More like a young executive in 
Cardinal’s clothing. But then he 



106 



GALAXY 




LISBON CUBED 



107 



found the scrap of gray beard in 
the box that belonged with the 
costume and fitted it on. It made 
all the difference. 

Talk about your disguises! Here 
his whole body was supposed to 
be a disguise, a disguise which was 
the uniform of the aliens’ Special 
Agents Division, of their terrestrial 
spy service. And now he was dis- 
guising that supposed disguise with 
a real one — just as, by being a 
supposed spy, he he was laying a 
trap for all the real secret opera- 
tives. 

Alfred Smith — one lone man 
against the aliens! 

“So that,” he whispered rever- 
ently, “government of humans, by 
humans and for humans shall not 
perish from the Earth.” 

The telephone. It was Jones. 

“Just got word from Robinson, 
Smith. That special mission of 
mine. It looks like tonight’s the 
night.” 

“Tonight, eh?” Alfred Smith felt 
the lace tighten around his throat. 

“Yes, they’re going to try to 
contact tonight. We still don’t 
know where — just that it’s in New 
York City. I’m to be on reserve; 
I’ll rush around to whoever finds 
the contact. You know, reinforce, 
lend a helping hand, be a staunch 
alley, give an assist to, help out 
in a pinch, stand back to back till 
hell freezes over. You’ll be at the 
plumbers’ ball, .won’t you? Where 
is it?” 



Alfred shook his head violently 
to clear it of the fog of cliches 
thrown out by Jones. “Menshevik 
Hall. Tenth Avenue. What do I do 
if I — if I discover the contact?” 

“You phmpff, guy, phmpff like 
mad. And I’ll come a-running. For- 
get about telephones if you dis- 
cover the contact. Also forget about 
special delivery mail, passenger 
pigeon, pony express rider, wireless 
telegraphy and couriers from His 
Majesty. Discovering the contact 
comes under the heading of ‘emer- 
gency’ under Op>erating Procedure 
Regulations XXXIII XLIX, inclu- 
sive. So phmpff your foolish head 
off.” 

“Right! Only thing, Jones — ” 

There was a click at the other 
end as Jones hung up. 

Tonight, Alfred Smith thought 
grimly, staring into the mirror. To- 
night’s the night! 

For what? 

lyrENSHEVIK Hall was a gray 
two-story building on the 
draftiest section of Tenth Avenue. 
The lower floor was a saloon 
through whose greasy windows a 
neon sign proclaimed: 

THE FEBRUARY REVOLUTION WAS

BAR & CRILL

The second floor was brightly 
lit Music oozed out of its windows. 
There was a hand-printed sign on

a doorway to one side of the bar: 

BOSS PLinMBERS AND STEAMFITTERS 
OF THE METROPOLITAN 
NEW YORK AREA 

SEMI-ANNUAL FANCY DRESS BALL 

You Must Be in Costume to 
Be Admitted Tonight 
(// you haven’t paid your associa- 
tion dues tor this quarter, see BUI 
Bushke at the bar before going up- 
stairs — Bushke’s wearing a Man 
in the Iron Mask costume and he’s 
drinking rum and Seven-Up) 

Alfred Smith climbed the creaky 
wooden stairs apprenhensively, his 
eyes on the burly General Mont- 
calm guarding the entrance at the 
top. To his relief, however, no in- 
vitation or ticket was demanded: 
his costume was sufficient valida- 
tion. The red-faced general barely 
gave him a glance from under the 
plushly decorated cocked hat be- 
fore waving him through. 

It was crowded inside. Scores 
of Louis XIIIs, XIVs, XVs and 
XVIs were dancing sedately with 
Annes of Austria and Marie Antoin- 
ettes to the strains of rumba and 
cha-cha. Overhead, two colored 
chandeliers rotated slowly, unwind- 
ing the spectrum up>on the glitter- 
ing waxed floor. 

Where did he begin? He glanced 
at the platform where the musi- 
cians sat; they alone were not in 
costume. Lettering on the bass 
drum told the world that “Ole 
Olsen and His Latin Five” were 
providing the rhythms, but that 
did not seem like much to go on. 



No one here looked like an inter- 
stellar spy. 

On the other hand, neither did 
Jones, Cohen, Kelly or Jane Doe. 
They looked almost spectacularly 
ordinary. That was it: you had to 
find these people in the unlikeliest, 
most prosaic places. 

Pleased by the inspiration, he 
went into the men’s room. 

At first, he thought he had hit 
it exactly right The place was 
crowded. Sixteen or so Musketeers 
stood around the wash-basin, 
munching enormous cigars and 
conversing in low voices. 

TTE insinuated himself among 
them and' listened closely. 
Their talk was eclectic, ranging 
freely from the wholesale price of 
pastel-colored water closets to the 
problems of installing plumbing 
in a new housing development on 
Long Island that was surrounded 
by unsewered streets. 

“I told the contractor to his 
face,” said a somewhat sallow, 
undersized Musketeer, knocking 
his cigar ash off against the pommel 
of his sword, “‘Joe,’ I told him, 
‘how can you expect me to lay pijie 
when you don’t even know the 
capacity, let alone the type — look, 
we won’t even talk about the type 
— of the sewer system they’re 
going to have installed out here? 
Joe,’ I said to him, ‘you’re a bright 
guy: I ask you, Joe, is that fair, 
does that make sense? You want 



LISBON CUBED 



109 



me to maybe install plumbing 
that’s going to be a lot weaker than 
the sewer system in the streets so 
that the first time the new cus- 
tomers flush the toilets, everything 
backs up all over the bathroom 
floor — you want that, Joe?’ ‘No,’ 
he says, ‘I don’t want that.’ ‘All 
right, then,’ I say, ‘you want me to 
maybe install plumbing that’s a 
lot better than necessary, a lot 
stronger than the sewer system 
will require, and that’ll add extra 
cost to the houses that doesn’t have 
to be added — you want that, Joe?’ 
‘No,’ he says, ‘I don’t want that.’ 
‘So, look, Joe,’ I say, ‘you’re will- 
ing to admit this is a dumb propo- 
sition from top to bottom? Sup- 
pose someone asked you to build 
a house, Joe, and couldn’t tell you 
whether the foundation under it is 
concrete or steel or sand or cinder- 
block. That’s just exactly what 
you’re asking me to do, Joe, that’s 
just exactly what.’” 

There was a rustle of approba- 
tion. A tall, weedy, mournful-look- 
ing Musketeer blew his nose and 
carefully replaced the handker- 
chief in his doublet before com- 
menting: “That’s the trouble with 
everybody. They think plumbers 
are miracle men. They got to learn 
that plumbers are only human.” 
“I don’t know about that,” said 
a stout Huguenot who had come 
up in the last few moments. “I 
take the attitude that plumbers 
are miracle men. What we got to 



use is our American imagination, 
our American know-how, our 
American thinking straight to the 
point. You show me a sewer sys- 
tem in a new community that 
hasn’t been installed yet, that no- 
body knows what its capacity is 
going to be, and I’ll figure out a 
plumbing system for the develop- 
ment that’ll fit it no matter what. 
And I’ll save on cost, too.” 

“How?” demanded the sallow, 
undersized Musketeer. “Tell me 
how.” 

“I’ll tell you how,” retorted the 
Huguenot “By using my Ameri- 
can imagination, my American 
know-how, my American thinking 
straight to the point. Thafs how.” 

“Pardon me,” Alfred Smith 
broke in hurriedly as he saw the 
sallow, undersized Musketeer take 
a deep breath in preparation for 
a stinging rebuttal. “Do any of you 
gentlemen know of any prizes 
that will be given for the best cos- 
tume, any door prizes, anything 
like that?” 

^ILENCE closed in as they all 
^ chewed their cigars at him ap- 
praisingly. Then the Huguenot 
(Coligny? Conde? de Rohan?) 
leaned forward and tapped him 
on the chest. “When you got a 
question, sonny, the thing to do is 
find the right man to ask the ques- 
tion of. That’s half the battle. 
Now who’s the right man to ask 
questions about door prizes? The 



no 



GALAXY 



doorman. You go out to the door- 
man — he’s wearing a General 
Montcalm — and you tell him 
Larry sent you. You tell him Larry 
said he should tell you all about 
door prizes, and, sonny, he’ll tell 
you just what you want to know.” 
He turned back to his smoldering 
adversary. “Now before you say 
anything, I know just what you’re 
going to say. And I’ll tell you why 
you’re wrong.” 

Alfred squeezed his way out of 
the mobful of rising tempers. At the 
outskirts, a Cardinal’s Guard who 
had just come up remarked brood- 
ingly to a black-hooded execu- 
tioner: “That Larry. Big man! 
What I wouldn’t give to be around 
when he take's a pratfall.” 

The executioner nodded and 
transferred his axe thoughtfully to 
the other shoulder. The rubber 
blade boimced once and came to 
rest. “One day there’ll be an an- 
onymous phone call to the Board 
of Health about Larry and they’ll 
send out an inspector who can’t 
be bought off and that’ll be that. 
Any guy who’ll buy up junk pipe 
and chromium-plate it and then 
sell it to his friends as new stuff 
that he’s overstocked in . .” 

“Don’t know nothing about 
prizes,” the doorman told Alfred, 
rocking his folding chair back and 
forth in front of the ballroom en- 
trance. “Anything important, they 
don’t tell me.” He tilted his cocked 
hat forward over his eyes and 



stared bitterly into space, as if re- 
flecting that with just a little more 
advance information from Paris 
the day might indeed have gone 
quite differently on the Plains of 
Abraham. “Why’n’t you ask around 
down in the bar? All the big 
wheels are down in the bar.” 

There must be a good many 
big wheels, Alfred reflected as he 
apologized his way through the 
crowded room downstairs. The 
hoop-skirts and rearing extrava- 
gant hair-dos, the knobby-kneed 
hose, swinging swords and pow- 
dered wigs jam-packed The Febru- 
ary Revolution Was the Only Real 
Revolution Bar & Grill so that 
the half-dozen or so regular cus- 
tomers in shabby suits and worn 
windbreakers seemed to be the 
ones actually in costume, poverty- 
stricken, resentful anachronisms 
from the futvure who had stumbled 
somehow into imperial Versailles 
and the intrigue of the Tuileries. 

At the bar. Bill Bushke, his 
iron mask wide open despite the 
sternest decrees of King and Cardi- 
nal, accepted dues money, dis- 
pensed opinions on the future of 
standpipes and stall showers to 
the mob in heavy brocade and 
shot silk around him, and periodic- 
ally threw a handful of largesse to 
the bartender, a chunky, angry- 
looking man with a spade beard 
and a white apron, along with 
the injunction to “set ’em up 
again.” 



LISBON CUBED

There was no way to get through 
to him, Alfred reali2ed. He asked 
several times about “prizes,” was 
ignored and gave up. He had to find 
a wheel of somewhat smaller dia- 
meter. 

A TUG at the sleeve of his cleri- 
cal gown. He stared down at 
the rather thinnish Mme. DuBarry 
sitting in the empty booth. She 
gave him a smile from imdemeath 
her black vizard. 

“Drinkie?” she suggested. Then, 
seeing his blank look, she ampli- 
fied: “Yousie and mesie. Just us 
twosie.” 

Alfred shook his head. “Nosie — 
I mean no, thank you. I — uh — 
some business. Maybe later.” 

He started to walk away and 
found that his sleeve failed to ac- 
company him. Mme DuBarry con- 
tinued to hold it between two 
fingers; she held it winsomely, deli- 
cately, archly, but the hold was 
absolutely unequivocal. 

“Aw,” she pouted. “Look at the 
whizzy-busy businessman. No time 
for drinkie, no time for mesie, just 
busy, busy, busy, all the livelong 
day.” 

Despite his irritation, Alfred 
shrugged. He wasn’t doing himself 
much good any other way. He 
came back and sat across the table 
from her in the booth. Then, and 
only then, was his sleeve released 
by the dainty fingers. 

The angry-looking man in the 



spade beard and white apron ap- 
peared at their booth. “Nyehh?” he 
grunted, meaning, quite obviously, 
“Whafll you have?” 

“I’ll have scotch on the rocks,” 
she told Alfred. “Scotch on the 
rocks is absolutely the only ever 
drink for me.” 

“Two scotch on the rocks,” 
Alfred told the bartender, who re- 
plied, “Nyehh,” signifying, “You 
order the stuff, I bring it It’s your 
funeral.” 

“I heard you asking about con- 
tests. I won a contest once. Does 
that make you like me a little 
better?” 

“What kind of contest did you 
win?” Alfred asked absent-minded- 
ly, studying her. Under that mask, 
she was probably somewhat pretty 
in a rather bony, highly ordinary 
sort of way. There was nothing 
here. 

“I was voted The Girl the 
Jimior Plumbers of Cleveland 
Would Most Like to Wipe a Joint 
With. It was supposed to be The 
Girl Whose Joint the Jimior 
Plumbers Would Most Like to 
Wipe, but some nasty people made 
a fuss and the judges had to change 
the title. It was three years ago, 
but I still have the award certifi- 
cate. Now does that help me at 
all?” 

“I’m afraid not But congratula- 
tions anyway on winning the title. 
It’s not everybody who can win 
an honor like that”

GALAXY 



T he angry-looking man in the 
spade beard came back and 
set glasses and coasters in front of 
them. “Nyehh!” he aimounced, 
meaning, “You pay me now. That’s 
the way we do business in this 
place.” He took the money, glower- 
ed at it, at them, and clumped 
back to the becustomered bar. 

“Well, what kind of contest are 
you looking for? If you tell me, I 
might be able to help. I know lots 
of little things about lots and lots 
of little things.” 

“Oh, contests, prizes, nothing 
particular.” Alfred glanced at the 
rear of the booth. There was a 
framed photograph on the wall of 
Plekhanov shaking hands with 
Kerensky. A much younger version 
of the chunky, angry-looking man 
in the spade beard was standing 
on tiptoe behind Plekhanov, strain- 
ing hard to get his face into the 
picture. Alfred realized he was 
wasting time and swallowed his 
drink unceremoniously. “I’ll have 
to be going.” 

She cooed dismay. “So soon? 
When we’ve just met? And when 
I like you so much?” 

“What do you mean you like 
me so much?” he asked her irri- 
tatedly. “When, to quote you, we’ve 
just met?” 

“But I do like you, I do. You’re 
the cream in my coffee. You’re 
the top. You do things to me. 
You’re what makes the world go 
round. I’m nuts about you. I go 



for you in a big way, big boy. I’m 
wild, simply wild over you. I’d 
climb the highest mountain, swim 
the deepest river. Body and soul. 
Roses are red, violets are blue. 
Drink to me only with thine eyes. 
Oh, Johnny, oh-h-h! You’re in my 
heart and my heart’s on my sleeve.” 
She stopped and drew breath. 

“Gah!” Alfred commented, his 
eyes almost popping. He started 
to get up. “Thanks, lady, for the 
pretty talk, but — ” 

Then he sat down again, his 
eyes reverting to their previous, 
poplike state. The way she’d ex- 
pressed herself when she’d wanted 
to make certain she was under- 
stood! Like Jane Doe, like Mr. 
Jones. 

He’d established rendezvous! 
“So that’s how much you like 
me?” he queried, fighting for time, 
trying to think out his next step. 

“Oh, yes!” she assured him. “I’m 
carrying the torch, all right. I ido- 
lize you. I fancy you. I dote on 
you. I hold dear, make much of, 
cherish, prize, cling to — ” 

“Good!” he almost yelled in the 
desperation of his attempt to break 
in on the language of love. “Good- 
good, good-good. Now I’d like to 
go some place where we can have 
some privacy and discuss your 
feelings in more detail.” He worked 
his face for a moment or two, com- 
posing it into an enormous leer. 
“My hotel room, say, or your 
apartment?”

Mme DuBarry nodded enthu- 
siastically. “My apartment It’s 
right near by.” 

A S she tripped out of the bar 
beside him, Alfred had to keep 
reminding himself that this was no 
human wench, despite the tremu- 
lous pressure of her arm around 
his or the affectionate bump of 
her hip. This was an intelligent 
spider operating machinery, no 
more, no less. But it was also his 
first key to the puzzle of what the 
aliens wanted on Earth, his entry 
into the larger spy organization — 
and, if he kept his head and en- 
joyed just a bit of luck, it might 
well be the means to the saving 
of his world. 

A cab rolled up. They got in, 
and she called out an address to 
the driver. Then she turned to 
Alfred. 

“Let’s kiss passionately,” she 
said. 

They kissed passionately. 

“Now let’s snuggle,” she said. 

They snuggled. 

“Now let’s snuggle a lot harder,” 
she said. 

They snuggled a lot harder. 

“That’s enough,” she said. “For 
now.” 

They stopped in front of a large, 
old apartment house that dozed 
fitfully high above the street, 
dreaming of its past as it stared 
down at a flock of rundown brown- 
stones. 



Alfred paid the driver and ac- 
companied Mme DuBarry to the 
entrance. As he held the elevator 
door open for her, she batted her 
eys at him excitedly and breathed 
fast in his ear a couple of times. 

In the elevator, she pressed the 
button marked “B.” 

“Why the basement?” he asked. 
“Is your apartment in the base- 
ment?” 

For answer, she pointed a tiny 
red cylinder at his stomach. He 
noticed there was a minute catch 
on top of the cylinder. Her thumb 
was poised over the catch. 

“Never you mind what’s in the 
basement, you lousy Vaklittian 
sneak. You just stand very still 
and do exactly what I tell you. 
And for your information, I know 
where you are and where your con- 
trol cubicle is, so don’t entertain 
any hopes of getting away with 
nothing more than a damaged uni- 
form.” 

Alfred glanced down at the re- 
gion covered by her weapon and 
swallowed hard. She was wrong 
about the location of his control 
cubicle, of course, but still, face 
it, how much living would he be 
able to do without a belly? 

“Don’t worry,” he begged her. 
“I won’t do anything foolish.” 

“You’d better not And no 
phmpffs out of you either, if you 
know what’s good for you. One 
solitary phmpff and I fill you full 
of holes. I ventilate you, mister. 



114 



GALAXY 



I plug you where you stand. I 
let daylight through you, I spray 
your — ” 

“I get the idea,” Alfred broke in. 
“No phmpffs. Absolutely. I give 
you my word of honor.” 

“Your word of honor!” she 
sneered. 

^I'HE elevator stopped and she 
-*■ backed out, gesturing him to 
follow. He stared at her masked 
face and resplendent costume, re- 
membering that when duBarry 
had been dragged to the guillotine 
in 1793, she had screamed to the 
crowds about her tumbril: “Mercy! 
Mercy for repentance!” Neither 
the crowds nor the Revolutionary 
Tribunal had taken her up on the 
honest offer. Was that a good or a 
bad omen for him? 

Not exactly to Alfred’s surprise, 
there was a man waiting for them 
in the clammy,., whitewashed base- 
ment The Huguenot He of the 
American thinking straight-to-the- 
point. 

“Any trouble?” 

“No, it was easy,” she told him. 
“I pulled him in with the Cleve- 
land -contest -three -years -ago rou- 
tine. He was smooth about it. I’ll 
say that for him: pretended not 
to be interested, you know, but he 
must have bitten hard. I found 
that out a few seconds later when 
I told him I loved him and he 
asked me right off to come up to 
his apartment.” She chuckled. “The 



poor, pathetic incompetent! As if 
any normal American human male 
would react like that — without so 
much as a remark about my beauti- 
ful eyes and how different I am 
and how about another drink, 
baby.” 

The Huguenot pulled at his lip 
dubiously. “And yet the uniform- 
disguise is a fine one,” he pointed 
out. “That shows a high degree 
of competence.” 

“So what?” The woman 
shrugged. “He can design a good 
uniform, he can think up a splen- 
did disguise, but what good is that 
if he’s slipshod about his perform- 
ance? This one’s barely learned 
anything about human methods 
and human manners. Even if I 
hadn’t known about him before, 
I’d have spotted him on the basis 
of his love-making in the cab.” 

“Bad, eh?” 

“Bad?” She rolled her eyes for 
maximum emphasis. “Oh, brother! 
I pity him if he ever pulled that 
clumsy counterfeit on a real human 
female. Bad isn’t the word. A 
cheap fake. A second-rate ad-lib, 
but from hunger. No conviction, 
no feeling of reality, nothing!” 

Alfred glared at her through the 
wide-open wounds of his ego. There 
were holes in her performance, he 
thought savagely, that would have 
closed any show the first night. 
But he decided against giving this 
critical appraisal aloud. After all, 
she had the weapon — and he had 



LISBON CUBED 



115 



no idea how ugly a mess that little 
red cylinder might make. 

“All right,” said the Huguenot, 
“let’s put him in with the other 
one.” 

With the red cylinder prodding 
into his backbone, Alfred marched 
up the main basement corridor, 
turned right at their command, 
turned right again and halted be- 
fore a blank wall. The Huguenot 
came up beside him and rubbed 
his hand across the surface several 
times. A part of the wall swung open 
as on hinges, and they stepped in- 
side. 

CECRET panels yet, Alfred was 
^ thinking morosely. Secret pan- 
els, a female siren, a Huguenot 
mastermind — all the equipment. 
The only thing that was missing 
was a reason for the whole damn 
bsuiness. His captors had not dis- 
covered that he was a human 
counter-spy, or they would have 
destroyed him out of hand. They 
thought he was a — what was it? 

— a Vaklittian. A Vaklittian sneak, 
no less. 

So there were two sets of spies 

— the Huguenot had said some- 
thing about putting him in with 
the other one. 

But what were these two sets of 
spies after? Were they both grap- 
pling for pre-invasion control of 
Earth? That would make his mis- 
sion much more complicated. To 
say nothing about trying to tell 



the police, if he ever managed to 
get to the police, about two inter- 
planetary invasions! 

And look who’d thought he was 
the counter-spy in the picture . 

The room was large and win- 
dowless. It was almost empty. In 
one corner, there was a transparent 
cube about eight feet on each side. 
A middle-aged man in a single- 
breasted brown business suit sat 
on the floor of the cube watching 
them curiously and a little hope- 
lessly. 

The Huguenot paused as he 
reached the cube. “You’ve searched 
him, of course?” 

Mme. du Barry got flustered. 
“Well — no, not exactly. I intended 
to, but you were waiting when we 
got out of the elevator — I hadn’t 
expected you for a while yet, you 
know — and then we got into con- 
versation and I just didn’t — ” 
Her superior shook his head 
angrily. “You talk about compe- 
tence! Oh, well, if I want anything 
done right, I just have to do it 
myself!” 

He ran his hands over Alfred. 
He took out Alfred’s fountain pen 
and cigarette lighter and examined 
them very closely. Then he re- 
placed them and looked puzzled. 
“He’s not carrying a weapon. Does 
that make sense?” 

“It certainly does! I wouldn’t 
put anything dangerous in the 
hands of anyone so ridiculously 
inexperienced!” 



U6 



GALAXY 



The Huguenot thought about it 
for a while. “No. He wouldn’t be 
running around by himself then. 
He’d be under supervision.” 
“Maybe he is. Maybe that’s the 
answer. In that case — ” 

“In that case, you both might 
have been followed here. Yes, that 
could be it. Well, we’ll fool them. 
Contact or no contact, we’ll close 
the operation There as of tonight. 
Don’t go out again — in an hour 
or so, we’ll leave the planet and 
take off with our prisoners for 
Headquarters.” 

He rubbed his hand against the 
cube as he had on the wall outside. 
An opening appeared in the trans- 
parency and widened rapidly. With 
the cylinder at his back, Alfred 
was pushed inside. 

“Give him a small blast,” he 
heard the Huguenot whisper. “Not 
too much — I don’t want him killed 
before he’s questioned. Just enough 
to stun him and keep him from 
talking to the other one.” 

There was a tiny click behind 
Alfred. A rosy glow lit up the 
cube and the basement room. He 
felt a bubble of gas form in his 
belly and rise upward slowly. After 
a while, he belched. 

'IJf/HEN he turned around, the 
” opening in the transparency 
had closed and the Huguenot had 
whirled angrily on Mme. du Barry. 
The lady was examing her weapon 
with great puzzlement 



“I told you I wanted him 
stunned, not tickled! Is there any- 
thing I can depend on you to do 
right?” 

“I was trying to be careful — 
I didn’t want to kill him, like you 
said! I aimed right at the control 
cubicle and I used the medium-low 
Vaklittian index. I don’t under- 
stand how he — how he — ” 

The Huguenot flapped both 
hands at her disgustedly. “Oh, let’s 
get out of here and start packing! 
When we get back tonight, I in- 
tend to ask Headquarters to as- 
sign me a new female assistant 
for the next Earth operation. One 
without so exact a knowledge of 
human males, perhaps, but who 
can be counted on to disarm a 
newly captured prisoner and to 
tell a Vaklittian index from a hole 
in her cylinder!” 

Mme. du Barry hung her head 
and followed him out of the room. 
The door-wall shut behind them. 

Alfred touched the transparent 
wall of the cube gingerly. There 
was no longer any hint of the 
opening he had been pushed 
through. The stuff, while as trans- 
parent as glass, was rubbery and 
slightly sticky, something like new- 
ly melted plastic. But a plastic, he 
found out, incredibly strong. And 
it gave off a whitish glow which 
enabled him to see through it, 
dimly, the featureless walls of the 
secret basement room. 

He turned and surveyed his co- 



LISBON CUBED 



117 



prisoner, a few feet away, on the 
other side of the cube. 

The man was looking at him 
suspiciously and yet uncertainly, 
as if he did not quite know what 
to make of the situation. There 
was a perculiarly nondescript, un- 
interesting and ordinary quality 
to his features which made them 
somehow extraordinarly familiar. 

Of course! He looked every bit 
as average as Jones, as Cohen, as 
Kelly and — in her own submerged 
feminine way — as Jane Doe. And 
then, with complete certainty, Al- 
fred knew who the man had to 
be. 

“John Smith?” he inquired. “I 
mean,” he added, as he recollected 
one of Jones’ earlier remarks, 
“Gar-Pitha?” 

The middle-aged man rose to 
his feet and smiled relief. “I could- 
n’t figure out who you were, but 
you had to be one of us. Unless 
you were a decoy they were plant- 
ing here to make me talk. But if 
you know my real name. 
What’s yours, by the way?” 

Alfred shook his head coyly. 
“Command Central — Robinson, I 
mean — has me on a special mis- 
sion. I’m not allowed to give my 
name.” 

John Smith nodded heavily. 
“Then you don’t give it — and 
that’s that. Robinson knows what 
he’s doing. You can’t go wrong 
by following Robinson’s orders to 
the letter. Special mission, eh? 



Well, you won’t complete it — 
now. She trapped me the same 
way. We’re both in the soup and 
good.” 

“The soup?” 

“Sure. Those filthy Lidsgallians 
— you heard them? They’re leav- 
ing tonight and taking us with 
them. Once they’ve got us on their 
home planet, they’ll be able to 
work us over at their leisure. They 
won’t get anything out of me, and 
I hope, for the honor of the Aca- 
demy, they won’t get anything out 
of you, no matter what they do 
to us, but we won’t be good for 
very much by the time they’re 
through. Oh, those Lidsgallians 
know their way around a torture 
chamber, yessiree, Bob!” 

“Torture chamber?” Alfred felt 
sick and knew he looked it 

T he older man reached out and 
squeezed his shoulder. “Steady 
on, lad,” he said. “Don’t show the 
white feather before the natives. 
Keep a stiff upper lip. Bite the 
bullet. Fight on for Notre Dame. 
Never say die. You have nothing 
to lose but your chains. Let’s keep 
the old flag flying.” 

As Alfred said nothing, John 
Smith took his silence for agree- 
ment with these high principles 
and went on: “You can’t get out of 
this cell — it’s a spun web of pure 
chrok, practically unbreakable. But 
the worst of it is its insulating 
quality: you can’t phmpff through 



118 



GALAXY 



chrok to save your life. I’ve tried 
to phmpff for help until I almost 
fractured an antenna — couldn’t 
raise a whisper. That’s why they 
don’t have to split up their force 
to guard us. And that’s why I 
haven’t bothered to come out of 
my uniform to talk to you: if we 
can’t phmpff, we’ll make more 
sense to each other with the jaw 
attachments of our uniforms.” 

Grateful for this small mercy, 
Alfred began to look around at 
the enclosing walls of chrok. “How 
about using these — these jaw at- 
tachments to get help?” he sug- 
gested. “Sound seems to go 
through. We could try yelling to- 
gether.” , 

“And who would hear you? Hu- 
mans. What could they do?” 

Alfred spread his hands. “Oh, I 
don’t know. Sometimes even hu- 
mans can be — ” 

“No, forget about it. Things are 
bad, but they’re not that bad. Be- 
sides, these walls are especially 
thick and there are no cracks in 
them. If those Lidsgallians hadn’t 
come down a couple of times a 
day to change the air, I’d have 
suffocated by now. As it was, I 
was in a bad way a couple of 
times and had to fall back on the 
reserve air supply in the chest — 
you know, the compartment right 
over the control cubicle? But Fll 
tell you this, if I ever get back to 
Vaklitt in one piece. I’ll really try 
to talk Command Central into 



drastically revising our uniform. 

“I thought of it while I was 
watching them search you. Do 
away with the air reserve in the 
chest. I’ll tell Robinson — how 
often, when you come right down 
to it, does one of our Special 
Emissaries ever find himself drown- 
ing or in the middle of a poison- 
gas war? — and find some way an 
agent can take a weapon, a real, 
honest, claw-operated weapon, into 
his uniform-disguise with him. Al- 
though, come to think of it, you’d 
need some sort of turret arrange- 
ment coming out of the human 
flesh to fire it, and those Lidsgal- 
lians, once they found out about 
it, would — ” 

He rambled on. Alfred, watch- 
ing him, realized how hungry he’d 
been for companionship. And this 
talkative mood might be put to 
use. They both might be in a 
Lidsgallian torture chamber some- 
where out in the Galaxy in a 
couple of hours, but there was a 
very slender chance that they 
might not. And, besides, facts were 
always useful; he could cop)e with 
whatever lay ahead a bit more 
easily if he only had some coherent 
facts on which to base his plans. 
This was the time, if ever, to find 
out who was the greater menace 
to Earth, the Vaklittians or the 
Lidsgallians — and who was more 
likely to accept the proffer of 
friendship from a badly frightened 
human.

Only — he had to be careful 
how he phrased the questions. He 
had to be prepared to cover up any 
blunders quickly. 

a YI^HY do you think,” he asked 
” carelessly, “the Lidsgal- 
lians hate us so much? Oh, I know 
the usual answers, but I’m inter- 
ested in hearing your opinion. You 
seem to have a very refreshing 
slant.” 

John Smith grunted apprecia- 
tively, thought for a moment, then 
shrugged. “The usual answers are 
the only answers in this case. It’s 
the war. Naturally.” 

“Just the war? That’s all, you 
think?” 

"Just the war? What do you 
mean, just the war? How can an 
interstellar war, going on across 
two-thirds of the Galaxy for almost 
three centuries, be just the war? 
Trillions upon trillions of individ- 
uals killed, dozens upon dozens of 
fertile planets smashed into space 
dust — you call that just the war? 
You youngsters must really be 
growing up pretty cynical these 
days!” 

“I — I didn’t mean it quite like 
that,” Aflred said rapidly, placat- 
ingly. “Of course, the war — it’s a 
terrible business and all that. Aw- 
ful. Positively horrible. Sickening, 
sickening. And our enemy, those 
vicious Lidsgallians — ” 

John Smith looked sandbagged. 
"What? The Lidsgallians aren’t 



our enemies — they’re our allies!” 

It was Alfred’s turn under the 
sandbag. “Our allies?” he repeated 
weakly, wondering how he was 
ever going to get out of this one. 
"Our allies?” he said again, trying 
a different intonation on for size 
and the bare possibility of sense. 

“I don’t know what the Aca- 
demy’s coming to any more,” John 
Smith muttered to himself. “In my 
day, you got a good general edu- 
cation there, with just enough lab 
work in espionage to warrant giv- 
ing you a commission in the Serv- 
ice if you filled all the other 
requirements. You came out of 
the Academy a wide-awake, cul- 
tured interstellar citizen, with a 
good background in history, eco- 
nomics, art, science and total 
terroristic warfare. On top of that, 
you had, whenever you wanted 
to use it, a decent and honorable 
trade — spying — under your belt. 

“Of course, if you wanted to 
specialize, you could always go 
back, after graduation, for inten- 
sive study in elementary and ad- 
vanced ciphers, creative disguise 
design, plain and fancy lying, phy- 
sical and mental torture, narrow 
fields of scholarship like that. But 
that used to be strictly p>ost-gradu- 
ate work. 

“Now — now everything is sp)e- 
cialization. They turn out dewy 
youngsters who can crack any code 
in space, but can’t tell a simple 
espionage lie to save their heads; 



120 



GALAXY 



they graduate kids who can knock 
out a masterpiece of a uniform- 
disguise, but don’t even know the 
difference between a Lidsgallian 
and a Pharseddic! Mark my words, 
this overspecialization will be the 
death of the Academy yet!” 

“I agree with you,” Alfred told 
him with ringing sincerity. He 
thought for a moment and decided 
to underline his endorsement 
“Shoemaker, stick to your last. A 
place for everything and every- 
thing in its place. Spare the rod 
and spoil the child. Look to the 
ant, thou sluggard!” 

He found he was going off the 
track and stopped himself. “But 
you see, the way the Academy 
feels today, its graduates will go 
into active service and meet older, 
more experiencd men like your- 
self who can give them this general 
political orientation right on the 
spot. Now, in a way, I really knew 
all the time that the actual enemy, 
in the deeper sense of the word, 
so to speak, were the Pharseddics, 
but — ” 

“The Pharseddics? Our enemy? 
But the Pharseddics are the neu- 
trals — the only neutrals! Look 
here, youngster, and try to get it 
straight in your mind for once. 
You absolutely can’t do a first-class 
job of espionage on Earth unless 
you know the general principles 
and the background data from 
which they’re derived. To begin 
with, the Lidsgallians were at- 



tacked — with provocation — by 
the Garoonish, right?” 

A LFRED assented with a posi- 
tive shake off his head. “Right! 
Any schoolchild knows that.” 

“All right, then. We had to go 
to war with the Garoonish, not 
because we had anything particu- 
lar against them, or liked the Lids- 
gallians, but because if the Gar- 
oonish won, they would then be in 
a position to conquer the Mairu- 
nians, who were our only possible 
allies againt the growing power of 
the Ishpolians.” 

“Naturally,” Alfred murmured. 
“Under the circumstances, there 
was no alternative.” 

“Well, that forced the Garoonish 
to make common cause with the 
Ossfollians. The Ossfollians acti- 
vated their mutual assistance pact 
with the Kenziash of the Nigel 
region, and, out of fear of the 
Kenziash, the Ishpolians joined 
forces with us and pushed the 
Mairunians into the Garoonish 
camp. Then came the Battle of 
the Ninth Sector in which the Oss- 
follians switched sides four times 
and which resulted in the involve- 
ment of the Menyemians, the Kaz- 
kafians, the Doksads, and even the 
Kenziash of the Procyon and Can- 
opus regions. After that, of course, 
the war began to get complicated.” 
Alfred wet his lips. “Yes, of 
course. Began to get complicated.” 
He decided, for the sake of sanity, 



LISBON CUBED 



121 



to bring matters much closer to 
present time and place. “Mean- 
while, here on Earth, there are the 
spies of — the spies of — Pardon 
me, but in your opinion just how 
many of these belligerents operate 
espionage networks on Earth? 
Regularly, I mean.” 

“All of them! Every single one 
of them! Including the Pharsed- 
dics, who have to know what’s 
going on if they’re to maintain their 
neutrality. Earth, as I hop>e you 
remember from your first-year 
course in Elementary Secrecy, is 
ideally situated just outside the 
usual battle zones, but within easy 
access of almost all the belliger- 
ents. It’s the only place left where 
information can be transmitted 
across the combat lines and deals 
can be made back and forth — 
and, as such, it’s zealously respect- 
ed by everyone. 

“After all, it was on Earth that 
we sold out the Doksads, and 
where the annihilation of the Men- 
yemians was arranged by their 
allies, the Mairunians and the Kaz- 
kafians. Just as now we have to 
watch our own oldest allies, the 
Lidsgallians, who have been trying 
to make contact with Garoonish 
for the purpose of concluding a 
separate peace! 

“I got the proof — I even found 
out the specific time and place 
the contact was to be made and 
what the arrangements were to 
be! But then I ran afoul of that 



female with her yacker of Cleve- 
land contests she won three years 
ago. And I got caught.” 

“The contact was to be made 
through a beauty contest of some 
sort, wasn’t it?” 

T he middle-aged man looked 
impatient. “Naturally a beauty 
contest. Of course a beauty contest. 
How else would anyone go about 
contacting the Garoonish?” 

“I couldn’t imagine,” Alfred 
laughed weakly. “The Garoonish, 
after all!” He sat in silence, abso- 
lutely unable to close mentally 
with the picture John Smith had 
evoked. The nearest he could come 
to it was a memory of something 
he had read about Lisbon during 
the Second World War. But this 
was Lisbon cubed, Lisbon raised 
to some incredible exponential 
power. All Earth was a vast laby- 
rinth of spy-threaded Lisbon. 
Spies, counter-spies, counter-count- 
er spies . 

Just what, he suddenly won- 
dered, was the correct human pop- 
ulation of Earth? Were there so 
many disguised interstellar agents 
that they outnumbered the host 
race? Would the world census 
show the truth — more humans if 
the agents hadn’t been counted, 
less if they had? 

Life had been a lot simpler 
with Puzzleknit Nylons, he de- 
cided, and that was his only real 
conclusion.

John Smith nudged him. “Here 
they come. It’s off to Lidsgall for 
us.” 

They rose to their feet as the 
wall opened. Two men and a wom- 
en came in, dressed in street cloth- 
ing. They each carried in one hand 
a small suitcase that looked heavy, 
and, in the other, the small, red 
cylindrical weapon. 

Alfred eyed the cylinders and 
found himself getting tense with 
a dangerous idea. The weapon had- 
n’t bothered him much before and 
it had supposedly been set to stun 
him. Well, perhaps the woman had 
a mistake in her setting — and 
perhaps the metabolisms of Man 
and Vaklittian were so different 
that a charge that -would knock 
out the one would merely give the 
other only an upset stomach. 

Then again, if Earth were so 
carefully maintained in her ignor- 
ance as John Smith had indicated, 
there might be no setting on the 
weapon that would damage a na- 
tive terrestrial at all: in the normal 
course of their intrigues with and 
against and around each other, 
these people might be enjoined by 
their own laws and by mutual 
agreement from carrying weapons 
that could damage humans. 

But if he were wrong? It still 
might take them quite a bit of 
time to realize that the Vaklittian 
frequencies were having no impor- 
tant effect on him, and he might 
manage a lot of action in that 



time. The alternative, at any rate, 
was to be snatched from Earth in 
just a few minutes and deposited, 
some time in the near future, in 
an extraterrestrial torture chamber. 
Even if he were able to prove his 
humanity to their satisfaction, they 
would have to dispose of him in 
some way — and the various de- 
vices of the torture chamber would 
be so handy. 

No question about it: people 
who go in for torture chambers 
do not make good hosts. 

O NE of the men fiddled with 
his suitcase, and the trans- 
parent cube dissolved around Al- 
fred and John Smith. In response 
to the gestures made with the 
weapons, they walked gingerly 
across the floor. They were mo- 
tioned through the open wall. 

Alfred found it difficult to recog- 
nize Mme. du Barry and the Hu- 
guenot without their masks and 
costumes. They both looked much 
like the new man with them, not 
bad, not good, just faces-in-a- 
crowd. Which, of course, was ex- 
actly how they wanted it 

He reached his decision as the 
five of them began walking through 
the opening in the wall. For the 
moment they were closely bunched 
together, even bumping against 
each other. 

He grabbed the woman by the 
arm and swimg her violently 
against the Huguenot who stag-

gered confusedly. Then, knowing 
that John Smith was between him 
and the new man in the rear, he 
hitched up his cassock and started 
to run. He turned left, and again 
left — and found himself in the 
main basement corridor. Ahead, 
at the far end, was a flight of 
stone stairs leading up to the 
street 

Behind him, there was the noise 
of struggle, then the sound of feet 
running in pursuit He heard John 
Smith distantly yell: “Go it, lad- 
die! Over the hill! Ride him, cow- 
boy! It’s the last lap — full speed 
ahead! Shake a leg! Hit the road! 
Go, man, go!” Then the Valklit- 
tian’s shout abruptly ended in a 
breathless grunt. After the sound 
of a wallop. 

A pinkish glow hit Alfred, moved 
back and over to light up 
his mid-section. He belched. The 
glow turned light red, deep red, 
dark, vicious red. He belched more 
frequently. He reached the stairs 
and was clambering up them as 
the glow became a throbbing, 
nightlike purple. 

Ten minutes later, he was on 
Sixth Avenue, getting into a cab. 
He had a mildly unpleasant belly- 
ache. It rapidly subsided. 

He looked behind him as they 
drove to his hotel. No pursuit. 
Good. The Lidsgallians would have 
no idea where he lived. 

Did they look like the Viklat- 
tian spiders? Hardly, he decided. 



All these different racial names 
and these titanic interstellar ani- 
mosities suggested many, many 
separate forms. They’d have to be 
small enough to fit into a normal 
human body, though. Snaillike 
creatures, possibly, and wormlike 
ones. Crablike ones and squidlike 
ones. Perhaps even ratlike ones? 

On the whole, a dreadfully un- 
pleasant subject. He needed a good 
night’s sleep, for tomorrow would 
be his first day at BlakSemes’. 
And then, after a bit, when he’d 
had a chance to think it all out, 
he’d decide what to do. The police, 
the F.B.I., or whatever. Maybe 
even take .the whole story to one 
of the New' York newspapers — 
or some top television commenta- 
tor might be more sympathetic 
and reach a bigger audience. 

His story would have to be 
coherent and convincing, though. 
He’d have little proof: the Lids- 
gallians were probably on their 
way back to their home planet 
this very moment. 

But there was his own gang — 
the 'Vaklittians. Cohen and Kelly 
and Jones. And Jane Doe. He'd 
kid them along for a couple of 
days and then use them for proof. 

It was time Earth knew what 
was going on. 

TTIS own gang was waiting for 
him in his hotel room. Cohen 
and Kelly and Jones. And Jane 
Doe. They looked as if they’d 



124 



GALAXY 



been waiting for a long time. Jane 
Doe looked as if she’d been crying. 
Mr. Kelly was sitting on the bed 
with his open briefcase on his 
knees. The eye on the telescopic 
rod swiveled as Alfred came in. 

“So there you are,” said Robin- 
son’s voice from the briefcase. “I 
hope you have an explanation, 
Smith. I only hope you have an 
explanation.” 

“For what?” Alfred asked irrit- 
ably. He’d been looking forward 
to getting out of his costume, tak- 
ing a hot shower, and then bed. 
This late performance of “I spy” 
was very annoying. Repetitious, 
too. 

“For what?” Robinson roared. 
“For what? Kelly, tell him for 
what!” 

“Look here. Smith,” Kelly de- 
manded. “Did you or didn’t you 
ask the desk clerk to find out 
about a plumbers’ fancy dress 
ball?” 

“I did. Of course, I did. He got 
all the information I needed.” 

There was a howl from the 
briefcase. “He ^ot all the informa- 
tion I needed! Six years of gen- 
eral studies in espionage at the 
Academy, a year of post-graduate 
work in Intensive Secrecy, six 
months at the Special Service 
School in Data-Sifting and Loca- 
tion-Tracing — and you have the 
nerve to stand there with your 
carapace in your claws and tell 
me that the only way of tracking 



down this fancy dress ball you 
could think of was to ask the desk 
clerk — an ordinary, everyday 
human desk clerk — to find out 
about it for you!” 

Alfred noticed that the faces 
around him were all extremely 
grave. Despite his weariness and 
strong feelings of indifference, he 
made an effort to conciliate. “Well, 
if he was only an ordinary, every- 
day human, I fail to see the harm 
that - ” 

“He could have been the Ga- 
roonish Minister of War, for all 
you knew!” the briefcase blasted. 
“Not that it made any difference. 
By the time he’d questioned his 
various sources and mentioned the 
matter to his various friends, ac- 
quaintances and business associ- 
ates, every spy organization in the 
Galaxy had been alerted. They 
knew what we were worrying 
about, what we were looking for, 
and where and when we hoped to 
find it. You accomplished one of 
the best jobs of interstellar com- 
munication ever. Sixty-five years 
of patient espionage planning gone 
down the drain. Now what have 
you to say for yourself?” 

Alfred stood up straight and 
manfully pulled back his should- 
ers. “Just this. I’m sorry.” He con- 
sidered for a moment, then added: 
“Deeply and truly sorry.” 

Some kind of storm seemed to 
explode in the briefcase. It almost 
rolled off Kelly’s knees.

“I just can’t stand this any 
more,” Jane Doe said suddenly. 
“I’ll wait outside.” She walked past 
Alfred to the door, her eyes swim- 
ming in reproachfulness. “Darling, 
darling, how could you?” she 
whispered bitterly. 

* I ‘’HE briefcase crackled down 
-*■ to some semblance of control. 
“I’ll give you one last chance. 
Smith. Not that I think any con- 
ceivable defense you might have 
would be valid, but I hate to de- 
mote a Special Emissary, to push 
him forever out of the Service, 
without giving him every chance 
to be heard. So. Is there any de- 
fense you wish to have registered 
before sentence of demotion is 
passed upon you?” 

Alfred considered. This was evi- 
dently a serious business in their 
eyes, but it was beginning to be 
slightly meaningless to him. There 
was too much of it and it was too 
complicated. He was tired. And 
he was Alfred Smith, not John 
Smith. 

He could tell them about the 
events of the night, about the 
Lidsgallians and the information 
he’d received from the captive 
Smith. It might be valuable and it 
might throw a weight in the scales 
in his favor. The trouble was that 
then the question of John Smith’s 
real identity would arise — and 
that might become very embar- 
rassing. 



Besides, he was over the fear 
he’d felt earlier about these crea- 
tures; they could do little more to 
him than a dose of sodium bi- 
carbonate, he’d found out. Their 
super-weapons were to be dis- 
counted, at least on Earth. And 
when it came to that p>oint, he 
was not all all sure that he wanted 
to give them helpful information. 
Who knew just where Earth’s best 
interests lay? 

He shook his head, feeling the 
fatigue in his neck muscles. “No 
defense. I said I’m sorry.” 

From the briefcase, Robinson 
sighed. “Smith, this hurts me more 
than it hurts you. It’s the principle 
of the thing, you see. The punish- 
ment fit the crime. More in sorrow 
than in anger. You cannot make 
an omelet without breaking eggs. 
All right, Kelly. The sentence.” 

Kelly put the briefcase on the 
bed and got to his feet. Cohen and 
Jones came to attention. There was 
evidently to be a ceremony. 

“By virtue of the authority vest- 
ed in me as acting chief of this 
field group,” Kelly intoned, “and 
pursuant to Operating Procedure 
Regulations XCVII, XCVIII and 
XCIX, I hereby demote and de- 
grade you, Gar-Pitha of Vaklitt, 
from the rank of Special Emis- 
sary, Second Class, to the rank of 
General Emissary or such other 
lower rank as Command Central 
may find fitting and necessary in 
the best interests of the Service. 



128

“I further direct that your dis- 
grace be published throughout 
every arm and echelon of the 
Service and that your name be 
stricken from the roster of gradu- 
ates of the Academy which you 
have shamed. And, finally, in the 
name of this field group and every 
individual within it, I disown you 
now and forevermore as a col- 
league and a comrade in arms and 
a friend.” 



It was, Alfred decided, a kind of 
strong-medicine ritual. Must be 
pretty affecting to someone who 
was involved in it personally. 

Then, from either side, Cohen 
and Jones moved in swiftly to 
complete the last, dramatic part 
of the ceremony. They were very 
formal, but very thorough, as they 
stripped the culprit of his uni- 
form.

never before offered for sale and enough Most Unforgettable Characters

THE MIDWICH CUCKOOS by 
John Wyndham. Ballantine Books, 
N. y, $3.50 

^ ITY dwellers may not know 
^ that cuckoos lay their eggs 
in alien nests for their brood to be 
raised by the unsus])ecting foster- 
mothers as their own. Wyndham 
employs this sneaky stratagem as 
the basis for a most off-trail and 
well-written invasion yam. 

The tired town of Midwich, 
England, is the beachhead. An 
unknown, inexplicable and trace- 
less visitation anesthetizes the 
town’s entire population for one 



day. Weeks later, every able fe- 
male is obviously pregnant, regard- 
less of marital status. Since there 
is no clue whatever to the nature 
or identity of the marauders, the 
Armed Forces can take no action 
other than a complete news black- 
out. Due to the delicate nature of 
the affliction, little word-of-mouth 
information leaves the environs, 
anyhow. 

Seemingly, the only govern- 
mental interest in the affair is 
the strictly imofficial appoint- 
ment of a yoimg local couple by 
an Army colonel as informants 
and pulse-takers. To them, their 



130 



GALAXY 



role is “As intriguing as the idea 
of an Obstetrics Division of Mili- 
tary Intelligence.” 

Eventually the women give 
birth. Their infants are golden- 
eyed, almost identical, and equal- 
ly divided as to sex. In addition, 
they possess an unholy power of 
compulsion. 

Wyndham does, too, as the 
reader discovers after being swept 
along to the conclusion. In the 
enjoyable confusion and suspense, 
a couple of key questions go un- 
answered. The book has been sold 
to Hollywood. Let’s hope they 
don’t come up with their usual 
godawful stock answers. 

ROBOTS AND CHANGE- 
LINGS by Lester del Rey. Bal- 
lantine Books, N. $2.00 

"PI EL Rey has a soft spot in his 
heart for the unhuman, and 
who can deny him the right? As 
one of the elders among SF au- 
thors, he was influential in the 
formative thirties in humanizing 
the story form as well. Remember 
“Helen O’Loy”? 

A couple of the eleven short 
stories date back two decades, 
most of the remainder only a 
handful of years, but all have the 
stamp of his compassion, whether 
for a fallen god in “The Pipes of 
Pan,” an xmemployed elf in “The 
Coppersmith” or a pair of sexed 
robots of “Into Thy Hands.” “No 



Strings Attached,” a horrible little 
yarn, and “Stability,” an inverted 
rework of the theme of Campbell’s 
“Who Goes There?” rescue the 
volume from sentimentality. 

THE STARS by W. Kruse and 
W. Dieckvoss. U. oi Michigan 
Press, Ann Arbor, $5.00 

^ I 'HE Palomar giant is actually 
discovering new island uni- 
verses at a fantastic pace, whereas 
it only appears that books on as- 
tronomy are appearing at an equal 
rate. In any case, the immensity 
of the subject leaves room and to 
spare for all volumes published 
and forthcoming. 

The Hamburg Observatorys 
Drs. Kruse and Dieckvoss have 
collaborated on an exceedingly in- 
telligently programmed text for 
the curious. They have started 
with a quick, easy explanation of 
optical principles and applica- 
tions to show how we seek, where 
we seek, what we find and how we 
can analyze our results. 

Lastly, they show how, as a 
result of the arduous labors of 
many specialists, a few great intel- 
lects can correlate the masses of 
information into theories and ex- 
planations of the nature of the 
Universe.

^ ILVERBERG and Garrett, 
Robert and Randall respec- 
tively, claim that future Earth, 
thoroughly civilized, with internal 
conflict abolished and no competi- 
tors among the stars, must generate 
conflict to escape stagnation. 

Unfortunately, the closest thing 
to a rival is Nidor, a backward 
humanoid theocracy steeped in 
peace and Scripture. An Earth- 
sponsored theological seminary is 
to do the trick by gradual psycho- 
logical alteration. Several genera- 
tions are chronicled, each result- 
ing in more independence of 
thought and dissatisfaction with 
rule by the Council of Elders. 

SF is full of stories of the up- 
lifting of backward cultures by the 
Good Earth, but few depict her as 
the sponsor of a heartless program 
that replaces happiness with its 
pursuit An essential program, 
possibly though arguably, but is 
it necessary? 

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 
SKY by Arthur C. Clarke. Har- 
court, Brace & Co., N.Y., $3.95 

YI^ITH this fourth collection of 
” Clarke’s short stories, the 
author himself is satisfied that all 
worthy of reprinting are now an- 
thologized. So am I, particularly 
since, for lack of alternates, too 
many of his O. Henryish crack-of- 
doom startlers had to be used. 
This is no slam: Clarke bows to 



no one’s trick ending. But too 
many are more than enough. 

However, there are several su- 
perlative items. A brilliant series 
of short-shorts first seen in the 
London Evening Standard under 
“The Other Side of the Sky” and 
“Venture to the Moon” headings, 
each six shorts long, alone are 
guidebook material to show, what

dred words. 

ONLY A TRILLION by Isaac 
Asimov. Abelard-Schuman, N.Y., 
$3.50 

S OMEONE recently said that 
Isaac lives funny but writes 
serious. If that’s true, here is the 
rule-proving exception. Almost 
certainly he had enormous fun 
writing this collection of articles. 
He staggers, frightens, amazes and, 
in two, fiendishly misleads his 
reader. 

The title conveys the spirit of 
the book precisely. Asimov goes 
far beyond mere figures to im- 
measurables and imponderables. 
He rocks one with the frightening 
fact that 38,000 atoms of potas- 
sium-40 are exploding in yoxir 
body — each second! He expresses 
a number utterly beyond compre- 
hension as the mathematical ex- 
pression of the chances against 
nature coming up with just the 
right combination of amino-acids 
to form hemoglobin. He treats 



132

other subjects in equally brain- 
busting but enjoyable fashion. 

As a bonus, his famous, utterly 
logical, utterly whacky “The Mar- 
vellous Properties of Thiotimo- 
line” and Pate de Foie Gras” are 
appended. 

How much is a trillion? A tril-

OUT OF THIS WORLD by 
Murray Leinster. Avalon Books, 
N.Y., $2.75 

T EINSTER- JENKINS began 
^ his science fiction writing ca- 
reer back when most of his pres- 
ent audience was either unborn or 
just barely. His basic training was 
in the gadget school of SF, al- 
though perhaps no other author in 
the field has shown his adapta- 
bility. That he still loves to 
gadgeteer is demonstrated in last 
year’s Colonial Survey and the 
present rampant spoof. 

In the old days, our scientist 
hero would whip up an Eiarth- 
saver from his well-equipped lab, 
but Leinster’s hillbilly works with 
just plain junk and, when finished, 
his sup>er whatzit still looks like 
junk. 

So does he, and he’s a lazy 
slob besides. It takes a heap of 
doing for Leinster’s narrator to 
prod him into activity against vari- 
ous foes and forces. 

Leinster was cautious, staying 



just this side of slapstick. Never- 
theless, it emerges more heavy- 
handed than most of his lighter 
works.

SCIENCE. The Grolier Society,

I^RDINARILY, an encyclo- 
pedic reference work does 
not fit into the scope of a column 
like this. But, since the Junior Edu- 
cation Corner’s purpwse is to sup- 
plement curricular deficiencies, 
this ten-volume set is just what the 
educator ordered. 

It contains 2,000,000 words; 
4,200 pages; 4,300 illustrations 
and 10,000 index entries. 

The fifteen basic divisions en- 
sure coverage of all the sciences: 
physical, theoretical, natural and

Ley on Space Travel; Dr. Lee De 
Forest, the father of the triode; 
R. Marlin Perkins of TV’s Zoo

of the AEC, etc. 

The set is large, attractive and 
eminently useful, and contains a

An outstanding reference library 
of the sciences for youngsters and 
fine for all adults except specialists.

That 

Metaphor 

In dealing with Meehs, "'Guard your 
tongue" was the worst advice — they 
would obligingly guard it for youl 

Illustrated by MARTINEZ 



I T was to be a formal affair- 
white shorts and tails— and 
Lane Borden wondered just 
how well Vorm would fit in. 

The servants and attaches here 
at the Embassy were used to the 
presence of visiting extraterrestials, 
but even they seemed disturbed 
by Vorm. 

If he had been a mere robot, 
there wouldn’t be any problem, 
but the idea of a sentient intelli- 
gence housed in a wholly synthetic 



body was difficult to accept. The 
body itself was not repulsive; it 
was largely metallic, but humanoid 
in its general contours. There were 
some rather disturbing differences, 
though. 

An engineer would probably 
grant the advantage of having six 
visual perceptors, or “eyes,” situ- 
ated equidistantly around the en- 
tire cranial compartment. Still, the 
knowledge that Vorm really had 
“eyes in the back of his head” and 



134 



GALAXY 




could observe everything in a room 
simultaneously created an unnerv- 
ing effect. Then, too, Vorm’s 
“mouth” was just a speaking-tube, 
and as for his “nose”— 

Lane Borden remembered what 
had happened earlier in the after- 
noon, when he’d conducted Vorm 
into his own apartments at the 
Embassy for a little informal chat 
That was when Borden’s fiancee 
had made an unexpected appear- 
ance. 

Borden was justly proud of 
Margaret Zurich. She was a strik- 
ingly beautiful woman and an in- 
tergalactically famous pianist— one 
of the few who still excelled in the 
ancient art of non-electronic mu- 
sicianship. Borden really envied 
her talent 

But when she abruptly entered 
the room where he sat with Vorm, 
he felt neither pride nor envy, 
merely a frantic fear. 

“Excuse me a moment” he said, 
nodding to Vorm as he rose and 
crossed over to Margaret Zurich. 
Before she could object he took 
her arm and led her out into the 
anteroom. Even so, he wasn’t at all 
certain that he’d managed to act 
in time to prevent a crisis. 

66T^ARLING, what’s the mat- 
ter?” Margaret asked. She 
stared at Borden’s throat “And 
what’s that thing you’re wearing 
around your neck?” 

“It’s a jammer,” Borden told 



her, opening a desk drawer and 
producing a duplicate of the con- 
trivance. “Just take this one for 
yourself. Here, I’ll show you how 
to put it on.” 

“But whatever for?” 

“You’ve heard of jammers, 
haven’t you?” 

“Oh. Of course. I’ve just never 
seen one.” She frowned. “You mean 
that creature in there is a tele- 
path?” 

“No, not in the ordinary sense. 
This instrument doesn’t scramble 
thought patterns. You’ll notice it’s 
worn aroimd the neck, at the 
larynx. It scrambles subvocaliza- 
tions.” 

“The thoughts one put into 
words but doesn’t speak aloud?” 

“Close enough. The point is he 
has unusual hearing ability which 
extends to detecting subvocaliza- 
tions. That’s why we wear jam- 
mers — to scramble the unspoken 
sounds.” 

“But I don’t-” 

“Please, we’ll discuss it later. I 
don’t want to keep my guest wait- 
ing.” 

Throat masked, pulse obscured 
by electronic impulse, Margaret 
reentered the room and met the 
visitor. 

She seemed startled by Vorm’s 
appearance, and even more star- 
tled when he acknowledged her 
introduction by abruptly reaching 
up and unscrewing the flaring 
spout above his speaking-tube. He 



BLOCK THAT METAPHOR 



135 



reached into the diplomatic pouch 
strapped to his waist and drew out 
a blunt nozzle which he inserted 
in the gaping hole. 

Margaret Zurich pretended not 
to notice, but Borden could see 
she was unsettled. Later on, he 
must take her aside and explain 
that nose-changing was a token of 
polite greeting in Vorm’s world. 
Vorm’s race did not need noses. 

Once, p>erhaps, millenia ago, 
they had been creatures of flesh 
and blood. Then, like hermit crabs, 
they had retreated into their syn- 
thetic shells; created the shells, in 
fact, to shield themselves from 
mortal frailties. They had sub- 
stituted mechanical evolution for 
physical evolution and now only 
the intelligence remained, encased 
in fabricated bodies that were 
wholly fimctional. 

In a completely prostheticized 
body, the nose was only a special 
tool. The diplomatic pouch Vorm 
carried must contain a dozen dif- 
ferent nasal attachments, each one 
designed for use in a given situ- 
ation. Borden knew of one which 
served as a drill, another which 
was a sort of acetylene torch, still 
another which was merely a great 
razor-sharp cutting instrument 
These were all useful to Vorm’s 
race in the mines of their planet. 

ES, Borden would have to 

make Margaret understand 
Vorm’s alienness, his super-sensi- 



tive faculties, his freedom from 
the physiological demands of eat- 
ing, voiding, sleeping. Margaret 
was not like those in the street 
mobs who yelled, “Down with the 
dirty Mechs!” Mechs. Mechanical 
monsters, without regard for hu- 
man feelings or human lives. 

Borden would set Margaret 
straight on that point, too. It had 
been an accident when the Mechs 
killed some of the humans in the 
first contact crew to reach their 
planet The crew hadn’t known 
that the Mechs could detect sub- 
vocalizations, nor had they realized 
another important psychological 
difference. The Mechs interpreted 
everything literally. There were 
no similes, no figures of sp>eech, no 
abstractions or hyperbole in their 
concepts. 

So when a crew member, ex- 
hausted by the rigors of the long 
journey and discouraged by his 
first glimpse of the barren planet, 
had subvocalized to himself, “Vol- 
unteering for an expedition like 
this — I ought to have my head 
examined!” the Mechs had taken 
him obligingly but lethally at his 
unspoken word. 

There had been more killing, a 
whole series of tragic incidents, un- 
til someone had been astute 
enough to ask the Mechs the 
reason for their actions. And the 
Mechs explained. Apparently they 
told the truth about everything — 
just as they accepted every state- 



136 



GALAXY 



ment of others as the truth. When 
it was learned that they detected 
subvocalizations, “heard” them, in 
fact, like humanly audible speech, 
the remedy became obvious. From 
then on, crew members wore 
quickly improvised jammers. And 
as an added precaution, they tried 
to avoid even thinking in exag- 
gerated terms. 

Borden and his people had set 
up the invitation which brought 
Vorm to Earth, and he’d studied 
the problems connected with this 
first visit very thoroughly. The 
Mechs could be indispensable al- 
lies. If the proF>er treaties and 
agreements could be made, the 
Mechs might solve many vital 
problems. For example, a Mech 
could work where humans couldn’t 
—in the mines of hot planets, on 
the peaks of cold planets, and 
amidst poisonous atmospheres or 
none at all. 

Borden was determined to see 
that emissary Vorm enjoyed his 
stay here, but he had to admit 
that this business of taking every- 
thing literally was awkward at 
times. 

For example, before Margaret 
left the room after her brief visit, 
she and Borden embraced. Worm 
didn’t comprehend the gesture, 
and after she departed he indi- 
cated his curiosity. 

Borden tried to tell him some- 
thing about physical contact, but 
the whole concept of tactile, func- 



tioning flesh was strange to the 
prosthetic being. 

“No love,” Borden mused. ‘I 
know you speak the truth, but it’s 
hard for me to accept. I just can’t 
seem to get it through my head.” 
Vorm reached into the diplo- 
matic pouch and pulled out a 
gleaming nasal attachment. “I 
could drill an opening,” he sug- 
gested. 

130RDEN said hastily, “You 
don’t understand,” aware that 
he’d made a slip despite his con- 
scientious effort to avoid one. “I 
was merely using a figure of 
speech.” 

“Speech is formless.” 

Borden nodded. “True. Yours 
is a realistic race.” 

“Very,” Vorm acknowledged. 
“Perhaps that is why we do not 
comprehend your emotions.” 

“But you do have feelings of 
your own. You know what I mean 
when I speak of fear, greed, pride. 
And you have esthetic apprecia- 
tion. You have told me that you 
enjoy music, for example.” 

“Yes,” Vorm replied, resonating 
in amplified excitement. “You 
promised to play something for 
me, did you not?” 

“Gladly,” Borden told him. 

And he was glad of the remind- 
er. It would be easier to play than 
to continue the discussion on an 
abstract plane, trying to avoid lin- 
gual pitfalls.

Besides, the music might help 
drown out the disconcerting sound 
which was faintly audible from 
outside the Embassy. All after- 
noon long, the crowds had been 
parading back and forth, carrying 
their stupid placards, don’t mix 
WITH MECHs! and no deals with 
monsters! were the mildest in- 
scriptions. And the fools kept 
shouting, “We know you’ve got a 
Mech in there! Will you bring him 
out or do you want us to come in 
and get him?” 

Well, they wouldn’t come in. 
Borden had the gates locked and 
guards posted. But it was embar- 
rassing under the circumstances. 
He wished he could go out and ex- 
plain the truth about those unfor- 
tunate first clashes between Vorm’s 
race and the early contact crews. 
But it would take time to register, 
even with a person of Margaret’s 
intelligence. In order to make a 
mob comprehend clearly, a whole 
campaign of indoctrination and 
education must be mounted. 

Such a campaign was in the 
works, but it hadn’t been launched 
as yet. Vorm’s visit had been pre- 
mature and unexpected; the best 
Borden could hop>e to do was 
shield him from the hostility of the 
uninformed masses. So much de- 
pended on the success of this meet- 
ing — and it was up to Borden, 
meanwhile, to establish and main- 
tain cordial relations. 

Borden knew how to play the 



role of a charmer. He had a col- 
lection of antique tapes, and he 
put on a few for his visitor. Vorm 
seemed to enjoy the mild dis- 
sonances— the finale of ProkofiefPs 
Chout, the rhythms of Villa-Lobos’ 
Urapmi, Respighi’s Fountains of 
Rome, and other primitive ex- 
amples of olden “symphonic” mu- 
sical compositions. 

Noting Vorm’s reaction, Borden 
excused himself and went off to 
dress, leaving his guest happily 
twiddling with his stereophonic and 
binaural ear-vents. 

"^^ORM’S preoccupation contin- 
’ ued long enough for Borden 
to get down into the dining hall 
and check on dinner arrangements; 
long enough for him to admit and 
greet the guests who arrived— awk- 
wardly but sensibly — through a 
rear entrance. It just wasn’t safe to 
use the front entry, with the mob 
outside. 

As it grew dark, the crowd in- 
creased. They were going to make 
a big demonstration, Borden knew, 
but there was no help for it. 

He was just thankful that most 
of the invited guests actually 
showed up, despite the impleasant 
situation. Most of them were gov- 
ernment people and all of them 
had been briefed about their con- 
duct. They wore jammers as a 
matter of course. 

When the group had assembled, 
Borden brought Vorm into the 



138 



GALAXY 



hall and introduced him around. 
For the most part, the humans 
managed to conceal whatever 
strain or agitation his presence in- 
spired, but there was a noticeable 
increase in the consumption of be- 
fore-dinner cocktails. Lawrence, the 
butler (it was a part of Embassy 
tradition to employ live servitors), 
circulated with his tray for a good 
half-hour or more before dinner 
was announced. 

Vorm went in with Margaret 
Zurich on his arm. She displayed 
admirable composure. Again, Bor- 
den was proud of her, and he had 
no reason to be ashamed of his 
guests. They ate and drank quite 
naturally and pretended not to no- 
tice that Vorm merely sat there 
and employed his oral orifice for 
speaking purposes only. 

If he felt awkward— or experi- 
enced actual repugnance — at the 
spectacle of human beings ingest- 
ing nourishment, he did not betray 
his reaction. His speaking-tube was 
in constant use and he seemed 
pleased to meet so many officials 
and dignitaries. 

Borden noticed that he had in- 
serted a different nasal attach- 
ment in honor of the occasion. It 
was a star-shaped instrument, ob- 
viously ornamental, for it was 
studded with diamonds. Several of 
the ladies openly admired it. Bor- 
den wondered what they would 
have said if Vorm had chosen in- 
stead to wear his drill, or perhaps 



the long razorlike knife. Surely the 
ladies would have remembered the 
“murdering monster” stories and 
reacted unpleasantly. 

For that matter, Vorm probab- 
ly regarded the throat-jammers as 
ceremonial decoration. If he was 
aware of the absence of subvocali- 
zations, he gave no sign. 

All was well. There were no un- 
toward incidents during the course 
of the dinner and Borden was 
quite relieved at its successful con- 
clusion. He led his guests into the 
drawing room and there an- 
nounced that Margaret would play 
a few selections in honor of the 
distinguished visitor. 

Some of the guests had never 
actually seen an old-fashioned 
“piano” before, but all of them 
were aware of Margaret’s reputa- 
tion as an artist. They settled down 
to enjoy the impromptu musicale. 

Borden and Vorm sat together, 
directly before the instrument. 
Vorm seemed fascinated with the 
spectacle of a “live” performance. 

Tl/r ARGARET’S repertoire was 
classical, of course. She spe- 
cialized in the three Bs — Bartok, 
Brubeck and Bernstein — and Bor- 
den sat back, beaming in pride as 
she played. 

“Do you play?” Vorm asked 
softly. 

“A very little,” Borden admitted. 
“But I lack the touch.” He hesi- 
tated. “Sometimes I think I wasn’t

cut out for diplomacy. I should 
have been a—” 

There was a sudden crash, and 
Borden jumped to his feet. 

Everyone started at the sound, 
then stared at the pavement block 
which had landed on the tesse- 
lated floor. Through the broken 
window came the clamor of the 
mob outside. 

Lawrence hurried over to Bor- 
den’s side and whispered. Borden 
faced his guests with a set smile. 

“Please don’t be alarmed,” he 
said. “There has been a slight acci- 
dent downstairs. I’ll attend to it. 
Margaret, if you’ll be good enough 
to continue—” 

And she did continue, while 
Borden raced down the hall, then 
took the stairway steps two at a 
time. Lawrence followed him with 
a force-gun such as the guards 
were holding in the foyer below. 

“Nasty,” Lawrence said. “They 
got through the gates somehow. 
It’s all the men can do to keep 
them from breaking down the 
door. Captain Rollins is afraid 
they’ll have to open fire soon un- 
less something is done to disperse 
the crowd. He wants your 
orders—” 

Borden nodded and brushed 
past him. 

“Wait, sir!” the butler quavered. 
“You aren’t going out there, are 
you? Here, you forgot the gun—” 

Borden kept going. At the door. 
Captain Rollins stepped up to in- 



tercept him. Borden walked past 
without a word and opened the 
door. 

The roar of the mob struck him 
like a great blow. 

“Give us the Mech! We know 
he’s in there!” 

Borden raised his hands, palms 
outward, to show he was unarmed. 
The gesture had its inevitable, im- 
memorial quieting effect. 

Afterward, he couldn’t quite re- 
member just what it was he had 
to, say. But words come easily to 
the trained diplomat, and Borden 
had risen to his present position 
due to superior qualifications. 

He started out by telling the 
crowd they had nothing to fear. 
Yes, there was a Mech inside, but 
couldn’t they see guards had been 
posted all around the building for 
the protection of the public? The 
Mech couldn’t possibly escape to 
harm anyone. Besides, he didn’t 
want to do any harm. Right now 
he was listening to music. Yes, 
the Mech was a music-lover! And 
if they didn’t believe it, they could 
hear for themselves, through the 
window. 

So there was absolutely no dan- 
ger. The Mech was guarded, 
would be guarded until tomorrow, 
when he’d return to his own planet. 
He had come here under govern- 
ment invitation, to conclude a 
treaty. The government needed 
Mechs to mine metals for the 
Galaxy.

141 



T>ORDEN found himself ex- 
plaining about the death of 
the crewmen during the first con- 
tacts. He went into a simpli- 
fied description of subvocalization, 
using his own jammer by way of 
illustration. 

As he lifted it back from his 
neck, there was a single frighten- 
ing moment of realization which 
he forced himself to suppress. 
Smiling, he went on with his talk. 

There was nothing to be alarmed 
about, he repeated. In fact, the 
Mech thought the guards were 
here to protect him — he was 
afraid of people! If it hadn’t been 
for the music, he’d probably be 
hiding under his bed right now! 

This got a laugh from the mob, 
and after that the rest was routine. 
In five minutes, Borden managed 
to break up the assemblage. In 
ten minutes, the street in front of 
the Embassy was almost cleared. 
Borden was able to turn matters 
over to Captain Rollins. 

“You did a wonderful job, sir,” 
Rollins told him. He paused. 
“Why, what’s the matter?” 

“Look at this.” Borden held up 
the jammer. “When I took it off 
to show the crowd just now, I 
noticed the input feeder was 
broken. It isn’t working.” 

“Think it came loose when you 
removed it?” 

“I hope so.” Borden’s voice was 
tense. “I’d hate to think I’d been 
sitting upstairs with our guest with- 



out the protection of a jammer.” 
He spied Vorm coming down 
the stairs, and turned, quickly de- 
taching the jammer from Captain 
Rollins’ throat. “I’ll need this,” he 
said. He barely managed to adjust 
it when Vorm arrived at the foot 
of the stairway. 

“I’m sorry, but I had to come,” 
Vorm said. “I know I caused you 
this trouble.” 

“It was all a mistake,” Borden 
answered. “A misunderstanding.” 
“Gracious of you to say so,” 
Vorm droned, his cranium bob- 
bing. “But I understand what hap>- 
pened. They came to destroy me 
and you turned them away. You 
saved me.” 

“Do not be offended. They just 
didn’t understand.” 

“I am not offended. I admire 
you. You see, I do possess certain 
of your emotions after all. While 
our race does not comprehend 
love, it knows admiration. And it 
knows gratitude. I am grateful to 
you, Mr. Borden. I must reward 
you.” 

“No need, I assure you.” 

“I shall see to it that we con- 
clude the treaty of which you 
spoke.” 

“I am overwhelmed.” 

“But that is not enough. I must 
think of something suitable for 
you, personally.” 

“Forget it, please.” 

“I never forget anything.” 
“Shall we join the others?”

' I ^HEY did, and the episode 
concluded. Margaret made no 
attempt to resume playing, and 
in a short while the guests de- 
parted. Although reasonably sure 
that there was no longer any dan- 
ger from the crowd, Borden in- 
sisted that they again use the rear 
exit. As for Margaret, he per- 
suaded her to stay over for the 
night. “I’ll feel safer if you do,” 
he told her. 

“Very well, if you insist.” 

She said good night to Vorm, 
and Lawrence escorted her down 
the hall to one of the guest apart- 
ments at the end of the corridor. 

Borden was left alone with 
Vorm, but not for long. He was 
embarrassed by the Mech’s pro- 
testations of gratitude. 

“Isn’t there something you 
want?” he kept repeating. 

“Not a thing.” Borden shook his 
head emphatically. “Now if I may 
be excused—” 

“That is right You must rest, 
is it not so? There is much I do 
not understand about the human 
structure.” 

“Good night.” 

“It is, isn’t it?” Vorm agreed. 

Borden retired to his own quar- 
ters. It had been an eventful even- 
ing. The affair was successfully 
concluded, the mob had dispersed, 
Vorm was favorably inclined 
toward a treaty. There was nothing 
to worry about — except, perhaps, 
the matter of the defective jam- 



mer. Quite probably it had failed 
when he took it from his throat 
out there before the mob. But if 
it had failed earlier — 

Frantically, he attempted to re- 
call any subvocalizations he might 
have made earlier in the course of 
the evening. It was an almost 
hopeless effort; one is scarcely 
aware of the constant and habitual 
phenomenon. Borden could only 
hope that his conscious efforts to 
think and speak only in literal 
terms had been successful; that 
he had not inadvertently emitted 
some perfectly normal idiom 
which might be capable of disturb- 
ing interpretation. 

He could not fall into deep 
slumber until near dawn, and he 
must have overslept as a conse- 
quence, because when he awoke, 
Lawrence was shaking him and 
saying something to the effect that 
Vorm had gone. 

“Gone?” Borden sat upright in 
bed. “But I was to take him to 
the launching-site myself.” 

“Captain Rollins did so, sir. And 
knowing you were tired—” 

“But I meant to say good-by.” 
“It wasn’t really necessary. 
Vorm told me to express his grati- 
tude.” 

“That again!” 

Tm afraid so, sir. You seem to 
have made a lasting impression on 
him because of your conduct last 
night. A diplomatic triumph, if I 
may say so.” He cotighed. “In

fact, he left you a little farewell 
gift” 

T AWRENCE extended the small 
white box and Borden fum- 
bled with the wrappings. 

“What for? More gratitude, I 
presume?” 

“Exactly.” Lawrence smiled. 
“He said he’d spent hours trying 
to think of something for a man 
who claimed he had everything. 
Fortunately, he told me, he for- 
gets nothing. And he happened to 
remember that you expressed a 
certain wish last night, which he 
was happy to be able to fulfill.” 
Borden halted in his efforts to 
untie the package. “A wish?” he 
muttered. “I don’t recall—” 

“He said that now you would 
be able to play the piano well.” 
Borden put down the package, 
very slowly. 

He stood up, thinking about 
Vorm. Vorm, who didn’t under- 
stand love, but who knew grati- 
tude. Vorm, who didn’t compre- 
hend human flesh and its frailty, 
but who knew that he could change 
parts of his own body at will, by 
simply unscrewing one instrument 
and replacing it with another. 



Vorm, who took everything abso- 
lutely literally. Vorm, who could 
install a nasal appendage which 
was like a great razor. 

“What’s the matter, sir?” Law- 
rence murmured. “Aren’t you even 
going to look at your gift?” 

But Borden was already run- 
ning down the hall toward Mar- 
garet’s room. 

He knew it was too late, just 
as he knew what must be in the 
package. Because now it came to 
him — he could remember how he 
and Vorm had sat there watching 
Margaret play the piano. 

“Do you play?” Vorm had 
asked. 

“A very little. But I lack the 
touch,” Borden had replied. And 
he’d paused, and the subvocaliza- 
tion must have come then. Yes, it 
must have come then, and the 
jammer was already broken, and 
Vorm had heard the unspoken 
wish — the wish he’d just granted, 
literally. 

Borden raced down the hall, the 
subvocalization thundering in his 
ears. Yes, he remembered the 
words now. 

"I wish I had those fingers—”
